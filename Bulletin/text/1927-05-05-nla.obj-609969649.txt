The Red Page
The Billabong School
It pains me to hear from a Good Aus-
tralian the periodical lament that “the
scarcity of local material for the Australian
novel amounts almost to a famine.”
Famine, fudge! J. S. Litchfield (R.P.
14/4/’27) and her friends are starving in
the midst of literary plenty ; they cannot
see the forest for the gum-trees; they are
pertinaciously looking for local material
for Australian fiction. Local material has
always been the foundation of fiction; and
goodness knows there are heaps—and not
only mullock-heaps—quite handy to the
local novelist.
Mrs. Litchfield leads her followers away
to the “vivid tropics” and the sea “that
washes the shores of that dazzling [North-
ern] coast, as lonely to-day as it wa3 all
those 300 yfiars ago,” and tells us of falls
600 feet in height and of a lonely" billabong
more than 300 feet deep hidden in the wilds
of the Northern Territory. There is no
need for such features in the landscape:
any good working novelist can invent, if
it pleases her literary soul, a billabong 3000
feet deep: there’s room for it, anyhow, in
this continent of ours. And if a billabong
is necessary for an Australian story, any
working novelist can manufacture one for
the purposes of his plot or setting. But
what use for .fictional purposes are these
topographical marvels? What human inter-
est is there in that billabong? It is the
human interest that provides the story;
the setting is merely the background
against which an author’s figures work out
their destiny. That back-cloth for his stage
may and should color the souls of the
actors in the limelight of the author’s per-
sonages; but the protagonist of the play
is the human being who has his own destiny
to reach, whether beside the billabong or in
his own back-yard. Mrs. Litchfield is
intent upon her scenery. Scenery never
made a play or a novel.
Human nature is fundamentally the same
the world over. A writer does not have
to traverse the Territory or the Mountains
of the Moon or study Shakspeare and
Homer to investigate and elucidate the
secrets of the human soul. The “fascina-
tion of the Unknown” is to be more surely
found not in billabongs but in the human
Ifeart. There lies the novelist’s scene.
There is no need to travel out back for
your hero and heroine. There are a million
souls in Sydney alone, any one of which
may by the creative ability of the novelist
be worthy of exploration and exposition.
Mrs. Litchfield eagerly points to “rolls of
old dusty reports, pigeon-holed in the
Government departments”; but why
trouble to rummage among the past when
all around us throngs the living present,
with all its emotions, its comedy' and
tragedy and pathos? There is the' easily
accessible field for legitimate exploration.
As for the blacks, “with their sagas still
unwritten,” let the black past bury its
blacks. I do not dogmatise, but merely
suggest that the influence of the aboriginals
upon the white _ Australian nation is one
that is now negligible and within a century
will be but a memory. Let us. save their
sagas if we can. and let us get on with
our more important work.
Let us stick to our job of presenting the
life around us, for the excellent reasons
that it is handy and important. Australia
has a soul in being, and it is the duty
of our writers to envisage and examine it.
It is of the Australian of to-day that the
reader of to-day desires to read. Romance?
Subjects for romance crowd around us in
every city street and at every moment of
our life. Characters jostle us in George-
street. 'There is no handicap of material
for dramas and novels. Australia is here,'
within us, not beside the distant billabong.
Unwritten masterpieces of the heart are to
be found in the cottage next' door or on
the ferry-boat. Take a walk down Martin-
place, or Surry Hills, or Darlinghurst, or
through Collins-street into Collingwood,
and get to work.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
Robert D. Fitzgerald
[The bronze medal of the Festival of Arts
and Letters has been awarded to Mr. Robert
David Fitzgerald, Junior, of Sydney, for his
unpublished volume of poems, “To 'Meet the
Sun. Professor L. H. Allen, of Duntroon
Military College, is the only other Australian
who has received this medal. Mr. John
Drinkwater acted as final adjudicator.]
Having read “The Greater Apollo,
Seven Metaphysical Songs,” by Robert, D.
Fitzgerald, seven times, and upon being
provoked to read it another seven, fresh
seeds .of thought and of knowledge kept
springing through lines where previously I
had been worried by the bright, yet diffi-
cult, language they rose from. Fitzgerald
has romance of mind, Without romance of
expression. Without romance of expression
because, from his vocabulary, he employs
borderland words and phrases which take
their parts poetically in prose, but become
prosaic in poetry. For example, watch the
following stanza, and see how it falls, un-
beautifully, towards the end: —
Though they are proud, those massive trees
And have for so long stood
Beside this street where, little of ease
The death-bound multitude
(They saw the grandfathers of these)
Chases a livelihood....
“The death-bound multitude” is fine. “The
death-bound multitude chases a livelihood”
is “the death-bound multitude” spoiled;
but "The death-bound multitude” with
interpolated “grandfathers,” between itself
and “chases a livelihood,” spells ruination.
Fitzgerald opens like an old book rather
than like a flower: the acrid flavor goes .to
the head, with little immediate effect upon
the heart; but his emotional approach is
camouflaged and gradual, and, once it has
been made, is never forgotten.
At the risk of seeming to contradict some
earlier remarks, let me quote, from the first
poem, a verse different from the rest:—
All colors, alj bright flowers I see
Are changing ever; yea, for me,
If I but close on it my eyes
Being shut out all beauts 7 dies
As, someday, it must utterly.
Here the fluctuating syllables reproduce, in
images of sound, the poet’s ideas upon
life and a voidless death; but this is a rare
quality with Fitzgerald.
In his Third Song he relates how he has
been storing up, and taking to himself, the
lovely things of Nature :
The savour of the sea-air, the low sounds
made
By winds that whisper secrets as they pass,
And he wonders:—
Strange that men have not yet perceived a
dearth
Of scent and sounds, a-vanishing away
Of all the firm realities of earth,
A gradual loss of beauty, day by day.
After which he strikes into stiff suburban
prose:—
For consciously I am collecting these.
It is a pity. Yet he shall return with
another verse, in another time:—
The valley path is calm and cool
As I walk here between green walls.
And so on, in perfectly balanced tune.
These are springs of Helicon, shining in
the air, from between massed boulders of
metaphysical origin.
Fitzgerald is an individual writer, and a
strong thinker; but, at present, he is work-
ing too hard at poetry to be, naturally, a
poet:—
For, consciously, I am collecting these.
Voltaire said something to the point
which happens to. be in favor of our future
famous Australian. “There can be no great
poetry without great wisdom; but how con-
nect this wisdom with enthusiasm?.... Like
Caesar, who formed his plan of battle with
circumspection, and fought with all possible
ardor.
HUGH McCRAE.
A Note on D. H. Lawrence
Mr. D. H. Lawrence provides a very
pretty puzzle for modem criticism, which
is perhaps the reason why modern criticism
has failed to make even an attempt at
explaining him. He has been tremendously
ignored in two-column reviews, and utterly
“cut” in panegyrics; he has been as much
talked about as almost any of the moderns,
and nothing has been said of him. The
only conclusion is that people have not
anything to say.
The root of Mr. Lawrence lies, I think
in his religious instinct. Religion is not a
popular topic nowadays, which is perhaps
the reason why it gives us so much trouble!
I have known a great number of genuinely
religious people, and not a few who are
generally termed religious maniacs, but
never have I known the mania so violent as
it is m Mr. Lawrence. The religious instinct
is a subtle thing; it is, I suppose, in its
essence an insistent demand to pierce the
veil of the world and enter into communion
with That which is above; it is something
so urgent in many men that its frustration
is morally and mentally and spiritually a
danger; if it cannot grow upward it will
grow downward; and if it cannot elevate
the soul it will pervert it.
Ihe upward seeking of the religious
instinct has been frustrated in Mr. Law-
rence. In him, more than in most of us,
it has worked strongly and deeply, and it
has never found the light. Instead, it, has
reached out towards dark and mysterious
things; it has gone into the night among
terrors and unimaginable shapes, and Mr
Lawrence goes down, the first of the
Liu opeans, into the gloom of the Aztecs.
I have no brief here for Orthodoxy of any
kind, and my point will be missed if it is
suggested that I am condemning Mr. Law-
rence from the viewpoint of any moral
theology. I do think Mr. Lawrence is
wrong, profoundly and unspeakably wrong;
but I am concerned here not with his wrong-
ness, but with his artistic vision. And his
vision is the vision of the demonology that
is like the ancient, fallen religion of the
Phoenicians; his vision is that which sees the
serpent and does not see the sun. Who can
read that, strange poem, “The Snake,” and
not feel that Mr. Lawrence sees something

The Goodyear Supertwist Balloon
is generally recognised as the fore-
most example of the tyre-building
art.
The superiority of the celebrated
cord material Supertwist lies in
its greater elasticity; under road
shock it stretches and recovers
without breaking. This flexibility
is inherent in the very structure
of the Supertwist cords themselves
and is not dependent upon latex,
gum or filler of any kind.

at least of that which was visible in Car-
thage?
For he seemed to me again like a king,
Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the under-
world,
Now due to be crowned again.
That is not poetry as we understand poetry
in the European tradition; it is the voice
of one who cries to a god. In one special
sense it is nearer to the Psalms than to
the poets; it is a yearning for the immola-
tion of the soul; and it is the strange, dark
thread that runs through all of Mr. Law-
rence’s writing.
D. P. McGUIRE.
The Picture Plot
It has been solemnly computed that there
are only 73 plots for stories. Of this small
number there are many that are not avail-
able for the purposes of the novel, the filma
or the drama. Plots surrounding incest and
other abnormal situations and human rela-
tionships and the vagaries of sex further
decrease the available plot-supply of the
world. For the purposes of the dramatist,
the novelist and the picture-producer, with
the impossible plots ruled out, there are
available in round numbers only about 50
and little possibility of discovering new ones.
This is a saddening thought; it portend:;
disaster to the moving-picture magnates. In
not a very distant future Hollywood may
have to close its “locations” and dismantle the
picture city. The sources of supply are with
increasing rapidity being recklessly used up.
In Sydney, and in any city of its size, on
an average ten screen pictures are provided
each week of the year. Several of the
shows provide two film plays on the same
programme. A sum of multiplication shows
that Sydney thus requires 520 screen plays
per annum, with 520 plots—which is absurd.
Obviously the situation is eked out by
repetitions, disguised by different settings
and lit by a little bit of originality. Some
of these somewhat frayed plots are recog-
nised every week by hardened filmabusters.
This continual repetition of the well-worn
must, in the end, weary the audience. Every-
body knows the plot of the poor girl who
achieves fame on the stage. It is an old
favorite. Equally in favor is the poor gill
who wins the prize of a rich husband,
though wisely the final fade-out is in a
bridal dress. Familiar are the plots of
the abduction of a nice girl by a scoundrel,
whom she ultimately tames and marries;
the pair who obtain a divorce and discover
that, after all, they love each other; the
hate that is turned to love; the youth
who becomes a millionaire after terrible
struggles, helped, of course, by the nice
girl; the masquerade of a girl as a man;
love in its varieties of father-love, mother-
love and brother-love; the famous Cinder-
ella motif; and the purely sensational and
dare-devil stunting and the knock-about
farce.
Yet we blithely go to the pictures to see
some new thing. The possible 50 plots may
be shuffled around, but the essential situa-
tion is bound to recur. The mathematical
deductions made are supported by the facts.
Go any night to a picture-show, and how
easily you recognise the inevitable poorness
of the plot, and recall hazily that you have
seen that scene before in a different dress!
Already the consistent picture-goer is be-
coming bored; all he looks for is some
slight trick of construction to give him the
fillip of interest.
There remains one unexpected outlet for
the producer’s ingenuity. The plots may,
perforce, have to repeat themselves, but the
captions—the writing on the screen-wall—
provide the “kick” to carry the play along.
After all, is it the big scenes that the movie
patron remembers? Is it not the clever
humor of the dialogue, set up with snap and
point,- that rouses the most hilarious
laughter? Having finished with their plots
the producers are now concentrating upon
not what the actor says, but what the screen
says for him. The film is becoming the
background for the apt word and the illu-
minating phrase.
A. H. A.
The Poets of the Tomb.
[Written after spending two years among
the MSS. that pour into The Bulletin
office.]
The first pang of poetic inspiration seems
to come in the form of a desire to write
something about death. The same inclina-
tion is shown in the embryo story-writer
who fancies that no yarn is complete with-
out a corpse or so, usually decorated with
nice gashes, and a minutely-described
splodge of red; but to the verse-writer
especially inspiration frames itself into the
thought: “I’ll go down to the cemetery and
write some poetry.” It is just as natural
as it is for the infant to howl when it
feels hunger.
The beginnings of poetry were probably
made when a bold hair-covered Tennyson
set the incoherent keenings of the tribe
over the dead into some sort of rhythmic
form. The application of the same prin-
ciple to love-noises came later. The bard
as he grows gets away from such subjects,
or at least their crudities; he finds inspira-
tion in thoughts that the less sophisticated
mind cannot discover. Some day, in a
really cultivated world, really cultivated
poets may write songs about chemical re-
actions and formulae. Yet as long as there
are beginners there will be those who, as
one of the Poets of the Tomb put it,
.... Wander about in the cemetery,
The place where we our corpses bury.
There is a gentle twining of love and
grief in most of these efforts, and points
never intended by the earnest writer are
sometimes scored:—
On Monday she was gay and dressed;
On Tuesday she took bad ;
On Wednesday I hoped for the best,
But what a shock I had!
On Thursday morn the doctor came,
To where in bed she lied;
On Friday morn the doctor came,
And after that she died. .
No satire was intended by the inspired
writer of that diary, nor was matrimonial
bitterness meant by this shot:—
Since she has gone no sun doth shine,
The world is girt with gloom ;
There’s nothing Half as sweet in life
As flowers put on her tomb.
The domestic touch with its augmenta-
tion of grief is, of course, prevalent. There
was one aspirant for verse honors who
illustrated the suddenness of a bereave-
ment by telling how the dead lady had
“left the dishes still unwashed.” There is
something even more poignant in this one:
No more she’ll wake and say,
“Get up and light the fire”;
No more she’ll take my pay,
When Friday comes its way,
My grief is dark and dire.
It is a poor week that doesn’t bring a
dozen corpses and as many tombs in the
mail. There is no demand for dead bodies
and tombs are a drug on the market, but
still they come. There is one young trier
who, since I started to tally him, has
buried five wives and eleven sweethearts
for the joy of describing how he silently
is weeping by the grave where they are
sleeping. He is only about 18, and
will grow out of the habit of killing every-
thing he loves.
Silence, by the way, seems an inevitable
ingredient of these melancholy offerings.
Not only do the mourners weep silently,
but the tomb is in nine cases out of ten
a “silent tomb.” Even when it rhymes
with “boom”:
In sootli, I do not know
How can I bear my grief—
My cerements of woe
That steal joy like a thief,
While wild-tongued sorrows boom
About her silent tomb.
They are not all simple efforts; there
is the aspirant who fancies that the real art
lies in tangling himself so that he hardly
knows his own meaning. A real mess-up of
this sort, with a few words that sound good
to the author, must be poetry:—
Ring down the curtain on our joys absolved ;
The earth is figmented with callous woe,
For pleasure naught with me can be involved,
Nor carol heart of mine that others know;
For she is dead.
A few of the infants may grow up. At
least one poet I know wrote in his begin-
nings worse than these examples. Since
then he has written one or two poems that
rank amongst the best, and his verses—
unfortunately rare—are always artistic.
HAROLO MERCER.
Childhood’s Gloom
I was arrested by a paragraph in Kenneth
Graham’s preface to “The Cambridge Book
of Poetry for Children”:—
“In the output of those writers who have
deliberately written for children, it is sur-
prising how largely the subject of death is
found to bulk. Dead fathers and mothers,
dead uncles and aunts, dead puppies and
kittens, dead birds, dead flowers, dead dolls—-
a compiler of obituary verse for the delight
of children could make a fine fat volume with
little difficulty. I have turned off this
mournful tap of tears as iar as possible, pre-
ferring that children should read of the joy
of life rather than revel in the sentimental
thrills of imagined bereavement.”
And now I know why my scholars always
shunned a book of fantastic stories written
by Kenneth Graham specially for children
—the stories were too happy. Life is not
always one simple round of unalloyed
delight, and children react on the life around
them; and thus a real part of their happi-
ness consists in being thrilled by imagined
sorrowful occurrences. Watch children at
play, acting the little dramas they invent
for themselves, and nearly every time you
will find the happiest of the party to be
the one simulating tears and woe.
Sorrow and tragedy reach deeper into the
fibres of our being than joy or laughter.
So Kenneth Graham is not read by children,
while Ethel Turner and Mary Grant Bruce
(to name only two of childhood’s favorite
authors) are read. They give girls something
to weep over, some character to pity, and
girls hug the books of these writers to
their bosoms —delighted. And, though he
may vehemently deny the accusation, a boy
likes a book that brings an occasional lump
to his throat.
So it is with children’s poetry. A child
will gaily laugh with C. J. Dennis, “Gather-
ing Eggs”—
Cackle and lay, cackle and lay,
How may eggs will you get to-day?
but will cheerfully sorrow over, and read
again and again, the “Little Boy Blue” of
Eugene Field, whose toys
Faithful to Little Bov Blue they stand
Each in his same old place,
Awaiting the touch of the little hand,
The smile of the little face.
As for Shakspeare, some would question
his appeal to children in the original, save
perhaps in such songs as “Where the bee
sucks, there suck I”; but I have seen young
readers gladly turn from that lightsome
creation, and put every shade of expression
into reading that gloomy dirge—
Full fathom five thy father lies,
Of his bones are coral made.
Anyone who cuts off the flow of sentiment
from children’s reading is depriving them
of half their happiness.
COUNTRY PED.
A Satchel of Books
The Path of the Sun, by R. W. Alexander
(Fisher Unwin). A rattling yarn of coral
reefs, lagoons and palms.
Along the Ottawa, by Lloyd Roberts
(Dent). Canada has its poets, too; but
this book of lyrics, serious and deyout, does
not reach a high poetic level.
The Hindu View of Life, by S.» Radii ak-
rishnan. The Upton lectures deSvered at
Oxford. They do not cover the whole field ot
Hindu philosophy, but are an exposition of
its central principles.
Brain Teasers, compiled by Digby
(Hamilton ; Robertson and Mullens). A book
of intelligence tests presented in a form
acceptable to young folk and quite Capable of
making many seniors think twice.
The Last Victorians, by A. A. Baumann
(Ernest Benn). A candid, and on the whole
fair, study of such lions of the later years
of the Victorian era as the Marquis of Salis-
bury, Randolph Churchill and Joe Chamber-
lain.
Lighten Our Darkness, by Robert Keable
(Constable). Once more Mr. Keable adven-
tures in the land of passion untempered by
the practical purposes set out in the Angli-
can Marriage Service. It is a theme that
grows wearisome.
The Case of Bevan Yorke, by W. B. Max-
well (Benn). Circumstances point to Yorke
being the murderer of Father Moring, the
high priest of a new religious cult under
whose influence Ursula Dibden, the object of
Yorke’s illicit affection, has been drawn. How
the tangle is unravelled and the crime brought
home to the guilty man constitute the interest
of a well written and exciting story.
The Vanishing American, by Zane Grey
(Harper; Robertson and Mullens). What is
the result of a white man’s education im-
posed on a red man’s nature? The author
sets himself to solve the question under
guise of a romantic and unconventional love
story, the outlines of which have already
been projected on the movie screen. Among
the best and most thoughtful of this writer’s
output.
Forbidden, by Joan Conquest (T. Werner
Laurie). From some notes in the pages of
her novel we learn that Joan is not only a
crack shot but devoted to riding, driving
(anything with wheels or legs), swimming,
fencing, flying, climbing, and is “a foot-loose
world-wide traveller.” From which it may
be anticipated that this tale does not loiter
on the way. Indeed it goes like a Chinese
gong—loud and reverberant.
Nadine, by G. P. Robinson (Duckworth;
Robertson and Mullens). On Maranos, a
small island near Cyprus, where the Prince
of the petty principality conducted a sort of
Levantine Monte Carlo, Tom Weymouth
meets the Princess Nadine, falls into a net-
work of political plotting, and eventually
escapes to England with his love treasure to
face the more prosaic adventure of maintain-
ing her as his wife. A romance that reads
like a musical comedy.
The Wreck of the Redwing, by Beatrice
Grimshaw (Hurst and Blackett). Once
more Miss Grimshaw draws the materials
for a vivid story from Torres Strait.
No writer is more competent to fix the local
color of the vagrant tropics where Manila-
men, Binghis, Papuans, Japs and derelicts
mingle in a picturesque setting. Her story
is one of primitive passions that holds the
reader till hero and heroine “sail away into
the golden noon of Torres Strait and of
Time.”
Genesis, by Dorothy Wellesley (Heine-
mann). A poem in which the evolutionary
chain is picked up at the day when “Man
rose at last, ape-like with patient eyes,” and
is carried link by link into present days—
Led by habitual labor, scared by death,
Contented from his first to latest breath
Humbly to set in order daily things,
Or twist plain things to beauty and to worth,
Seeking in these to ease continual pain,
Symbols of kinship and similitude
Between himself and earth.
The poem moves with dignity, and has pas-
sages of beauty.
Seamarks and Landmarks, by O. U.
Andrews (Ernest Benn). A book of travel
by a surgeon-captain in the Royal Navy.
The pages devoted to the Dardanelles will be
of special interest to Australian readers. Of
the sniping that went on during the Gal-
lipoli campaign, he says: “ Apropos of snipers,
some of them were women who, with leaves
in their hair, mud and green paint on their
faces and bushes to camouflage their bodies,
sniped our men.” An interesting record of
service in many quarters.

The National Institute for the Blind
(headquarters, Great Portland-street, Lon-
don) is doing a great work for the blind
throughout the Empire. Not only does it
provide for the world-wide dissemination
of intelligent propaganda—that is, propa-
ganda which transforms pity for the blind
into admiration of their courage and cheer-
fulness—but all embossed books and music
published by it can be purchased by the
blind resident in the Dominions or Depen-
dencies at one-third actual cost price. In
addition, the same annual subscription to
all periodicals published by the Institute
is in force “at home and abroad.” Anyone
with a blind friend or acquaintance should
make a point of applying for copies of the
Institute’s Braille and Moon catalogues.
Moon is a simple and embossed variation
of ordinary Roman type, easily learned by
people who lose their sight in old age and
who find it difficult to acquire a knowledge
| of Braille.

This Sweeper
Saves Work & Carpets
WOMEN who take pride in
keeping their homes spotless
are devoted users of Bissell Carpet
Sweepers because with a Bissell they
can do their sweeping in half the time
and do it better. A few minutes’ use
and rugs and carpets are speckless.
Dirt, dust, crumbs, litter vanish like
magic before it.
The Bissell is a time saver; pays for
itself many times over in broom cost
and puts into the discard the dust
c’ouds, tired back and weary arms of
old-fashioned broom sweeping.
An exclusive Bissell feature, “Cyco”
ball bearing construction with four
sets of specially mounted bearings in
the wheels where they are needed,
make it run easier, last longer, sweep
better; and, for good measure, into
each Bissell Carpet Sweeper goes the
experience of 50 years. It’s real purse
economy to insist on a Bissell.
Little Bissells for little girls at trifling cost
make useful gifts and happy children. Sold
by leading merchants everywhere. Write for

Exultation.
Touch my hands, O Wave!
Touch my lips, O Sea!
You have carried the barque of the lad that
I love
And you bring his heart to me.
Tis a heart that is frank and free,
And he loves us both, O Sea;
Rival lovers of his are we,
But mine shall the triumph be.
Green and gold are your drops
That through my fingers run ;
They are gold as the face of the lad that
I love
Who is loved by the tropic sun.
He is kissed by the tropic sun
All day till the day is done;
am shouting, aloud in mirth and fun
For liis heart is won, it is won.
Strike my hands, O Sea!
Smite my breast, O Wave!
You may swallow the barque of the lad that
I love,
But my heart shall sing and be brave.
Rise in your wrath and rave,
My love liis soul shall save;
We shall rise in joy from your cavernous
grave
And kiss on the crest of the wave.

Song About Pirates.
(To be played solemnly.)
Four pirates lurk at the foot of the stair,
Kidd and the bos’n and John Silver’s there,
Waiting to scuttle me as I sail by.
And I don’t like the look in the fourth one’s
eye.
I am bound for Trinidad with a cargo rare;
I had better be sailing while the wind’s fair,
Over the hearthrug and down the hall.
Heigh! I don’t like the look of the fourth
one at all.
Kidd, he’s a demon when he is in his drink,
The bos’n’s a shocker, and Silver is a sink;
But ye will go to Davy, and your soul unto
the Lord
If the fourth bold buccaneer ever comes
aboard.
Let go the stuns’l, free the big jib-boom,
And by the grace of God and Kidd I’ll reach
the dining-room,
And then I’ll send the navy to chase them
out of sight;
But I fear the fourth will have me when the
rest say “Good-niglit.”

Progress.
This child is sister to my soul.
She knows where I can dimly see.
The thing I scarce can understand
Becomes a lily in her hand
Of wild, sweet fantasy.
A thousand ages fashioned whole
The beauty trembling in my gaze.
She feels one throbbing instant mort
And knows the voices near the shore
Of gracious stranger days.
From all far years we take the toll
Of things remembered in our blood.
For her the grace of every spring,
Of happy light on wave and wing
Brings laughter to the flood.
I hold the shadows sorrow stole
From sunshine in grey times remote.
For her the world is one blue hour
Where, like a golden cloud in flower,
A wind-blown dream may float.

DAVID MCKEE WEIGHT.
The Dream Gift.
I’ve held the thought of you so long
As something precious, all my own—
A talisman to keep me strong,
A tenderness that’s quietly grown
Up from my soul and touched my careles-
mind
Unto a wistful love for all mankind.
Because of you the world was dear,
And yet aloof, remote as Death
From my lit life. You were so near
My inmost thought; and when the breath
Of rain-swept gum-leaves brought the dawn’s
still flame
I woke to radiance, murmuring your name.
And now you’re tired—-with eyes most kind
And smiling lips, I told my lie —
And you are gone, nor leave behind
Aught of regret. I cannot cry.
A very perfect knight held me 'in thrall,
A heart-created ghost, not you, at all!
My thoughts are free, the days are long
For everything that is my own.
You've taken all the hurt and wrong;
But that dream-fashioned love has thrown
A light on lovely things I do possess;
Close is the world, dear in its littleness.
And joy is ever whispering
And quivers in my heart, to see
Sun glinting on a bird’s white wing,
Grey leaf-buds op’ning on a tree—
God’s sunlight falls on every path I wend :
God’s darkness waits to soothe me in the
end.

KATHLEEN ROSE FRANCIS.
Dead Timber.
The ringbarked trees as ghosts
Blanched in the moonlight stand,
Leaves shed and limbs awry,
A grisly band:
As if, did a wind wake,
They’d sudden move and moan
With the ghosts of birds and bees
That they have known.
But on a Lethean wold
They seem to have come to bide,
Gaunt, naked, unconsoled,
Beyond Time’s tide;
As if on them no wind
Could blow, no sun could pour
Ilis light, but a moon would shine
For evermore.

R. CRAWFORD.
In a Sydney Park.
These winding paths again I tread,
Who walked them once—how long ago?—
Thro’ mild delights of spring, and sped
To sec the summer colors glow.
Here lilied waters, ’neath a bridge
Where ivy grew, crept lazily.
I walked on air, for on that ridge
One watched for me.
I used to make pretence to read
(Watching his shadow on the grass)
If I came first. And yet what need?
For o’er the printed page would pass,
Intent upon surprise, his hand.
Ry routes known to us two alone
We’d pass into a Fairyland,
All, all our own.
We fared with Borrow’s Romanies,
And with Theocritus we dwelt
In Syracuse. With Drake we felt
The lust of war and piracies.
We shared in Montezuma’s fall,
And shrugged at Cortes’ tawdry gain;
The Gulf Stream knew; the Roman Wall
In English rain.
Till suddenly, from out the Tower,
Would ring across each park and street
Familiar chimes, to end an hour
Idyllic, rare, almost too sweet.
How far away those glad hours seem
Of Indian summer, ardent, swift!
I wonder do you ever drift
In here to dream?

Empire.
Men built an empire slowly, stone by stone;
Great soldiers schemed and mighty states-
men planned
The whole colossal structure, watched it rise
Huge, tyrannous, and infinitely grand.
The generations came and dreamed and went,
Each, polyp-like, to raise his tiny cell
Of the vast whole; and then, sardonically.
Time crooked his little finger, and —it fell!

RAWHIA.
Once More.
I know a wind-sought she-oak grove
That murmurs low
Hard by a cave within a cove,
Where all day long and all night through,
While sun and star their rounds pursue,
Tides come and go.
In from the outer deep they creep
On stealthy feet;
And, errands done, unto the deep
Return again by beach and bar,
Tired travellers that wander far
And then retreat.
No sleep they know, tliose restless tides
That, sea-sent, rise
And, sea-called, fall, while, white-winged,
glides
The gull above them in the noon,
Or in the night the questing moon
Sails through the skies.
Yet many things unseen by men
Their coming greet,
And many lives renewmd again.
Lives saved, in strange and hidden ways
To them give gratitude and praise
For succor sweet.
Dry, drooping weeds with gentle hand
They lift once more,
While shellfish, gasping on the sand
Or ooze, or in some tepid pool,
With whispers low, caresses cool,
They wander o er.
Aroused by them, new life begins
In bay and reach;
With silver sides and shining fins
Fish plunge and leap, while circling run
Swift ripples, flashing back the sun,
To rock and beach.
Sweet music, too, ail times they bring
Where’er they sweep:
For then is heard strange murmuring.
Soft lispings and low lullabies,
Such as be dim tired urchins’ eyes
With mists of sleeu.
Within that crooning she-oak grove
I would that I
Might stand again while in the cove,
At ebb of tide or flood of tide,
Lay mirrored, sunset-lit and dyed,
Rock, tree and sky.

THE PRE-SELECTION FRAUD.
The political Cockies occasionally quarrel
among themselves, but, however bitterly
their leaders fight, the rank and file nearly
always exchange preferences, where pre-
ferential voting is practised. They did this
in Victoria last month, with the result that,
while Labor made no gains and the Nation-
alists lost Attorney-General Eggleston,
Oman, Barnes, Baird and Farthing, the
Agrarians increased their strength. When
Allan’s group and Dunstan’s come to-
gether again, as they assuredly will, the
party will have one Leg. Assembly seat
more than it ever had before. At the West-
ralian election also the Cockies were the
only party that added to their numbers. In
both States (and others) the population of
country electorates is distributed in scat-
tered settlements, varying, of course, in
size. If pre-selection obtained, a candidate
m a populous centre would have a much
better chance of getting the nomination
than a perhaps worthier aspirant in some
small and remote hamlet. That would give
rise to personal and parochial and, pos-
sibly, sectarian feeling injurious to the
party. The “open go” removes these dan-
gers, or, at least, reduces them to a mini-
mum, besides making a strong appeal to the
many “midway” electors who object to their
choice of a representative being restricted
by a clique controlling a machine. So it
has helped the Cockies greatly in both
States. It has also helped the Country
party in N. S. Wales, where the conditions
are much the same; and that party will
be very foolish if it declares for pre-
selection, as recommended by one of its
supporting associations, which should pray
for eyes.
# ❖ *
The Vic. Nationalists believe in pre-
selection—or did. Farthing’s East Mel-
bourne seat having been wiped out by the
Allancock Redistribution Act, they tried to
thrust him on Caulfield as the party nomi-
nee, none genuine without the label. The
gentleman was crushingly defeated by an
Independent Nationalist or Liberal who had
denounced pre-selection as a swindle
wherever he went. In Kew also the National
Federation man was beaten by a Nation-
alist who, though an excellent candidate in
every respect—he was a Digger and a
Rhodes Scholar—was out of favor with the
party bosses. Both these new electorates
were hopeless from the Labor point of
view, so the impudent coterie who arrogated
to themselves the right to say who should
and shouldn’t stand in the Nationalist in-
terest were without a shred of justification.
The pre-selectors had their way in the new
Oakleigh constituency and realigned Essen-
don, and, greatly to their surprise, both
went to the Labor party. Yet the voting
indicates that Labor could not have won
Oakleigh (it was 3627 behind the Nat.-Lib.
total after the first count), and might not
have won Essendon, where its solitary
opponent was a cold-tea person, had the
Nationalists run two or three candidates in
each district and asked their supporters to
vote the ticket. Indeed, if Lawson’s crowd
had had the sense to discard pre-
selection and to announce that candidates
would not be expected to support the Allan-
cock redistribution if, like Watt and Max-
well, Nationalist M’s.H.R., they did not
believe in it, electoral reform being a non-
-party matter, it might now be in a posi-
tion to form a Government instead of being
despised and rejected of the electors.
Eggleston and Farthing would no doubt
have gone, but the party would not have
suffered thereby, as it did; Oman’s seat
would probably have been saved by con-
tingent votes, as Mackrell’s was to
the Cockies; and the victories gained
in Waranga and Upper Yarra, where
there were several Government candidates,
would most likely have been repeated in
Oakleigh and Essendon. And the way would
have been clear for Angus, Snowball,
Everard, Gray, Forrest and Kent Hughes
to support a Nationalist Government, in-
stead of being driven to call themselves
Independent Liberals, Progressive Nation-
alists and Heaven knows what else, and to
let a minority Labor Government come in.
Strange as it seems, the Prime Minister
has learned nothing from the imbecility of
the Nationalist wirepullers in his own State.
With the mortifying results of their pre-
selection impert/nences staring him in the
face, he has associated himself with a plot
to foist Archdale Parkhill, secretary of
the N.S.W. National Federation, on the
50.000 Federal electors of Warringah as the
only Nationalist candidate with the name
blown on the bottle, and has engaged himself
to speak on Parkhill’s behalf. Parkhill
is the gentleman who announced his candi-
dature for North Sydney in 1922, but had
to stand down because of Hughes’s flight
from Bendigo. He was consoled on that
occasion with a cheque for £2OOO and a sort
of promise of a safe Nationalist seat —as if
such seats were the property' of the few
hundred persons, mostly obscure, who call
themselves the National Federation. Had
the friends of this official thrown his hat
into the ring without seeking any unfair
advantage over other Nationalist candi-
dates, if any. there would be nothing against
him. But for a handful of nonentities to
thrust him forward as the choice of Nation-
alism. brushing the claims of all other
Nationalists aside—and this in an elector-
ate where a hundred Nationalists could
stand without the slightest chance of a
Labor man getting in—is a particularly
odious brand of cheek. Warringah is not
the kind of electorate in which such pranks
can be played with impunity. In the corres-
ponding State division of North Shore the
electors have twice revolted against the
machine and put in the unendorsed Nation-
alist, who, as it happens, is contesting War-
ringah against Parkhill and all comers—
Scott Fell. He is a bumptious and in
many respects objectionable person, but he
is a man of large ability and independent
mind, and he champions a vital principle.
By lending his sanction to this Parkhill
scandal, the Prime Minister merely invites
another rebuff.
“THE END OF WHITE AUSTRALIA.”
Wails and forebodings are among the
great natural products of the North, and
they come most plentifully from the eastern-
side, because there are very few in the
middle North to wail, and not many in
the western North to forebode. They are
not always a practical crowd, these
Jeremiahs of the upper latitudes, if Dr.
Jensen, the geologist, who prophesied
recently at Cairns, may be taken as a
sample. This was his view:—
“It was very satisfactory to note the strong
feeling of resentment sweeping over this
part of the State owing to the closing of the
Etheridge railway line. It should be more
generally recognised that the State Govern-
ment's action is a blow to the North and to
the policy of White Australia. Unless the
Federal and State Governments woke up and
gave justice to the North we should see the
end of the White Australia policy within
the next decade. Instead of closing down the
Etheridge line the authorities should repair
bridges, put the railway in order, and extend
it to Croydon, to complete the railway con-
nection w T ith the Gulf.”
Unfortunately the gulf that matters most
up that way is the gulf between revenue
and expenditure; and those who want un-
payable trains to continue to run on unpay-
able lines ought to explain how it is to be
done. Of course The Bulletin would like
it done. It hates to see trains stopped and
thistles growing over permanent way. In
some cases the building of lines fore-
doomed to show a loss has lured men to
spend all their means on enterprises that
inevitably had to crash when the trains or
trams stopped. But, while such sufferers com-
mand sympathy, they cannot reasonably
ask that the countiy shall go on losing
money eternally. Every line so built
which has attracted population and outlay
ought to get a fair and thorough trial: so
much is due to the men who have been
beguiled into spending time and money. But
no district is entitled to be a permanent
pensioner.
c * * *
The curse of our railway system has been
the intrusion of the vote-hungry politician,
who has set out brazenly to buy support
with the people’s lOU. This policy has
done damage in a dozen ways. It is even a
question whether the loan razzle has not
been responsible for a movement back out
of the North, people desiring to be nearer
the source of supply and the fount of
honors, jobs and perquisites. It is, at any
rate, no use the North blaming men for
not being able to make a pound of damper
out of half a pound of flour. But that does
not relieve the present of all responsibility.
The blame lies not only with the past, which
poured out money without regard to the
earning capacity of the works on which it
was spent; it lies also with the present,
which is afraid to demand and require a
fair day’s work from those who are now
employed on the railways. Frankly, dis-
honesty, past and present, is sending in its
bill now to every Queenslander; and be-
cause the dishonesty has not stopped the
bill will go on growing.
The North is, moreover, misgoverned from
an amazingly long distance away. Bill
McCormack, who is supposed to look after
the most populous part of it, is at the
other end of the globe, just as his predeces-
sor used to be, struggling with loan pro-
blems; and the Prime Minister, who is
responsible for the largest section of tropical
Australia, is absent in Europe much of the
time doing business with kings and presi-
dents, and is absent in the clouds a good
deal of the rest of the time. The absentee
curse would be greatly alleviated if the
most inhabited part of tropical Australia
was established as a separate State with its
own metropolitan centre of population.
Some good might result if the Prime Minis-
ter would interest himself in the matter,
and bring to bear on it that tact and diplo-
macy which impressed the crowned heads
of Europe and elsewhere. The present
situation is very precarious. Progress—even
lack of retrogression—in North Queensland
depends very largely on the sugar industry,
and that now relies almost wholly on arti-
ficial support. It depends in a very minor
way on cotton, and that relies to some
extent on artificial support. Everything in
the State is hampered by the practical
impossibility of creating a new line which
will pay expenses, and the difficulty in
keeping an old line up to the expense-paying
point. An embittered alderman of Greater
Brisbane declared lately that where day
labor in the Council’s employ made a yard
and a half of road in a day, an equal force
in the pay of a contractor accomplished 25
yards. If half this tale is true there is
nothing in the geologist’s dream of railway
extensions in the Gulf country, and not
much in the geologist’s hope that railway
contraction can be avoided. Even Dr.
Jensen’s theory about great deposits of
“dredgeable tin,” talked of at the same
time, would be more cheering if it were
not that deposits seem to produce so little
effect in McCormack’s land. Even Mount
Morgan only exists now even as a low-wage
concern which has paid no dividend for seven
years because the State contributes 12s. per
week per man to the wage fund. If the
North is to make a fresh start, or a start of
any sort, during this generation, it is essen-
tial that the community shall realise the
simple fact that two and two make four,
and that no juggling or delay will make the
answer anything else.
THE COMPRESSED AUSTRALIAN.
Dear Bulletin, —He might almost br
described as the tinned Australian, so much
is he compressed, and the difficulty of find-
ing an adequate explanation of this ten-
dency is a haunting problem. In tin-
connection the letter of “S.N.R.” (B.
14/4/’27) might have been spread out to
cover a multitude of subjects. The writer
put in a plea for the existing system of one
university for each State, which means six
institutions, three hardly visible to the
naked eye, for a continent and some islands.
He might have gone further and pointed
out the advantage of having a minimum
of ports in use, and only half a dozen cities
large enough to be worth calling such, and
but seven Governments, which seven many
“uncouth crooks” and others propose reduc-
ing to one.
V $ * *
The British person, though he is so
crowded into his narrow isle that he has
to climb a tree to breathe, shows much
more of the expansive spirit. Taking the
educational position first, Great Britain had
five universities at the time when Perkin
Warbeck made a very inferior scuffle with
Henry VII. for the English throne, three
being in Scotland and two in England.
When Elizabeth finished her masculine
career the United Kingdom had seven of
them—four in Scotland, two in England
and one in Ireland. Even before the genuine
conquest of the distressed isle was anything
like completed, the stormy royal female
founded a university at Dublin, and others
arose later. England alone has now 11
universities, that of London being far the
largest, with Oxford a moderate second.
Most of them admit men and women on
equal terms, and in addition there are a
few institutions where Eve leads the lone-
some hen-existence and Adam is barred
out as a dissipated undesirable. It was 9fi
years ago that the conservative Englander
first struck the idea of planting the tree
of knowledge all over the country, and
making it fairly cheap as well as accessible
He realised that though, in theory, the
student should go to the lonesome fount
of learning, regardless of cost and the state
of the roads, he very seldom did, so the
conservative Englander accepted the inevit-
able. The Scotsman was at least 250 years
ahead in this respect, and the number ol
graduates who perished at Flodden is
alleged to have been incalculable. The
bleak little land of brose and heather lias
\\ million less inhabitants than Australia,
and with 10,138 students against Australia’s
8128 it cuts a rather striking figure, especi-
ally as Australia is badly on the down
grade in this respect. Whether this is
evidence that the Australian system is
faulty is a matter of opinion.
Still, the higher education problem is
only an illustration of how the condensed
or compressed life has become a habit with
the Australian, and not a very important
illustration either. The tendency is all-
pervading. It has just been announced as
tidings of great joy that Melbourne will
probably touch the million population-
mark within another year, or possibly before
the close of this year if the country dis-
tricts are denuded of their inhabitants with
the velocity that is looked for. In every
State there is more or less disturbance about
the necessity of shifting another cargo of
Lower House members from the country,
which is of less and less importance, and
may yet be of no importance at all, to the
big city that counts. Victoria’s Allancock
Government has apparently lost the num-
ber of its mess through insufficient recogni-
tion of the fact that the Rest of the Stat*-
is a back number. Some rather belated
census figures from the Cold Country set
forth that in England and Wales 40 per
cent, of the people dwell in 46 towns with
more than 100.000 inhabitants apiece. This
was considered sufficiently surprising to
be worth a cablegram. Yet in expansive
Australia 45 per cent, of the people live
in jive towns with more than 100.000 in-
habitants apiece, and the percentage in-
creases rapidly. It is so much the Australian
way that the matter is hardly regarded as
worth more than a perfunctory mention.
The reports of expensive engineer
Buchanan on the Commonwealth’s neg-
lected harbors have awakened certain politi-
cians to the recollection that expensive
engineer Coode was hired to report on the
same subject 40 years or thereabouts ago.
and there has even been a languid search
in the basement to discover what he said
on the matter. The Federal Treasurer was
even moved to fleeting emotion when d
was recalled that a port, with allegedly
vast capacities for population and com-
merce, had been the subject of a neglected
recommendation for 40 years, though d
lies in the Treasurer’s own electorate, and
he was born and brought up there, and
the principal town was named after him—
or vice versa. It is expected, however, that
he will calm down. Australians have
passion for building new lines, and it
carried so far that, in a westerly direction
from Sydney, there are four or five areas
absolutely enclosed by bag-like formation-
of .railway, and others are in process ot
being enclosed. But new lines in genera■
might suffer from hydrophobia, to judge o'
the intensity with which they avoid deep
water and possible new centres of popula-


tion. Or it may possibly be a resuscitation
0 f the unsociable hermit instinct. No other
civilised white community shows the con-
densation or compression tendency as Aus-
tralians do. There doesn’t seem much in
the theory that it is an emanation from
the soil, though careful analysis might not
be amiss.—Yours, ,T. E.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Repentance of a Young Man.
Having an engaging way Mr. McKell was
probably the best Minister to tell London
that N.S.W. proposes to lead a better life.
In addition he stated that its past wasn’t
so black as it was painted, and in places
was only dark brown. He was unconvinc-
ing along both lines, but he had two points
in his favor: the financiers of London must
be forbearing with so big a debtor lest
they should bring him down on their own
heads, and loan flotation is a highly pay-
able business for the professional floaters.
They have found a profit in raising money
for Turks and Egyptians, and so long as
money can be raised a loan on behalf of
some of the lower animals would be as
good an excuse as another.
Mr. McKell stated frankly that his
State’s visits to the pawnbrokery have been
frequent and its demands large. As said
demands have amounted to over 17 millions
(three locally and 14 abroad) during the still
unfinished financial year, he might even have
said that the demands had been incredible.
However, he laid stress on the assertion
that the N.S.W. variety of public works
improves with age instead of depreciating,
and that only 21 per cent, of the debt is
buried in profitless undertakings. Against
this stands the gloomy fact that there is
a tendency to acquire more profitless under-
takings every year, and the dismal circum-
stance that the gold loans raised in other
parts have ceased to go into undertakings
of any sort to any extent worth mention-
ing. With an engaging frankness the young
Minister admitted that the Ma State, by
the official figures, had shown “for the last
four years” an adverse trade balance, or
in other words that its exports didn’t pay
for its imports and left nothing whatever
with which to meet interest liabilities. What
the State’s official figures actually say is
that, taking the average of the four years
to June, 1926, exports were nearly 11 mil-
lions annually short of the sum required
to pay for imports, and about 17A millions
annually short of the sum required to cover
imports and the outside interest bill. These
figures fully explain why the Ma State is
scratching the ends of the earth for finan-
cial accommodation, and there was no need
to lay the blame, as Minister McKell did,
on the Sydney harbor bridge, which is too
young and unfinished to defend itself, and
on other unobtrusive items. The manner
of the deliverance may have been faultless,
but the matter presented a poorly-veiled
resemblance to a bankruptcy schedule -
“Causes of insolvency: sickness (mostly
mental) in family, lack of sufficiently re-
munerative employment because it wasn’t
looked for very hard, expensive living, too
much holiday, overmuch drinking, persistent
backing of the wrong horse, and neglect of
the rudimentary principles of accountancy.
Tnencumbered assets nil. Deficiency un-
certain. Prospect of dividend largely depen-
dent on the securing of further credit.”
Having thus outlined the situation the
Minister drew pictures of improvement in
the bright and happy future. Both N.S.W.
and Queensland “having accepted the prin-
ciple of sinking funds in connection with
their United States loans,” it was impos-
sible for them not to do as much in the
matter of future loans in London. This
wakens a sleeping dog of no ordinary size.
On the reasonable assumption that the
sinking fund is to apply to future renewals
as well as to fresh loans, the bill for repay-
ments will attain to large proportions.
Something of the sort has long been in-
evitable, but that makes it no more agree-
able. How that portion of the fund which
will call for gold is to be met except, as
the external interest is met, by further loans
is not explained, and the value of a sinking
fund which is provided by loans is not
great.
Anyhow, a new era is about to dawn,
and the Slang Government will be born
again. Expenditure has reached the “peak,”
which will be satisfactory if there are not
higher peaks beyond. Despite the chronic
and utter inability to make ends meet, and
Respite all the new T liabilities which are
looming, the cheery McKell saw nothing
but bright prospects ahead. He repented
gracefully, which is more than his gloomy
chief would be capable of, and promised
amendment with a light heart. He even
almost promised that the seasons rvould
mend, and help matters along.
♦
The Commonwealth Bank.
Ip any Federal Minister expected that Sir
Krnest Harvey, of the Bank of England,
would recommend an English colleague as
Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, he
was greatly mistaken. Sir Ernest insisted
°u the wisdom of choosing a man with
knowledge of Australian conditions; and the
board followed that up with a strong recom-
mendation of the acting-governor, E. C.
Riddle. The Governor appointed him, and
uo better thing could have been done. Even
'f a man a little better had been available
kom outside—and The Bulletin has never
board of him—it would still have been
better to promote from within the service.
But the position is not wholly satisfac-
tory. The appointment rests entirely with
the Government of the day. The board of
directors has nothing whatever to do with
it. Now it may happen that a Prime Minis-
ter or Treasurer may want, the bank’s assist-
ance in a way which the Governor may
regard as a departure from sound banking.
It is pretty certain that something of the
sort happened in connected with Jambs
Kell, Mr. Riddle’s predecessor. At the
last general election the Prime Minister
announced that home-building was an im-
portant plank in his platform. Mr. Bruce
had every right to that plank; but Mr. Kell
insisted that the Government had no right
to expect the Commonwealth Bank to help
if it didn’t consider the business thoroughly
sound. Over that he and the Treasurer were
long at loggerheads; and evidently Mr. Kell
thought it better to resign than take the
chance of not being re-appointed by the
politicians.
Appointment for a definite limited period
is bad. Appointment without any contract
at all would be better—always on the
assumption that the position would remain
with the man who held it so long as he did
the work and behaved himself. Those are
the terms on which 99 heads out of every
100 hold their jobs in the service of private
enterprises.

The Communist Way.
The principles of Communism are elusive,
and when one has tracked them to their
lair it is generally found, on consulting-
further authorities, that it was the wrong
animal. But if the principles of the crowd
are difficult to get at, its practices, past and
present, are well enough known. The
“movement” held Paris for two months in
1871, and these are some fragments out of
an account of what it left behind: —
•'The city was practically in ruins. Whole
streets had been burned down. The rue
Royale was first fired on and then the flames
were fed with petroleum. There a number
of women in a lying-in hospital were help-
lessly burnt to death. The Vendome Column
was sawn through at the base, and after
many unsuccessful efforts it at last crashed
to the ground, scattered into a thousand frag-
ments. The Hotel de Ville, a gorgeous civic
palace whose history dates back to the
twelfth century, was as comnlete a ruin as
centuries of neglect could have made it ; The
destruction included palaces, courts of jus-
tice. schools, hospitals, railway stations,
docks, etc.
“Practically the whole of the damage was the
deliberate, intentional work of the Commune.
A small proportion was due to the fighting
with the Yersaillais, a very little to the
Germans.
“But if the incendiarism of the Commu-
nists brought eternal shame upon them, what
words can. be found to express the callous
and brutal disregard they showed for human
life? They burnt the wretched women in the
rue Roy ale. They burnt 600 of their own
number in the destruction of the Hotel dc
Ville. When the end was in sight they mur-
dered in cold blood the hostages contained in
the Mazas prison. They included an arch-
bishop, many ecclesiastics and 60 eminent
citizens.”
News from China is scrappy as yet, and
the complete history of the upheaval there
won’t be written for years. But the scraps
suggest that neither years nor distance has
made any difference in the kind of people
who help to keep Premier Slang in office.
Some recent snapshots:—
“Envoys of Moscow have made the Nation-
alist movement here a mockery. Coolies feel
free to loot, burn and kill, not out of patriot-
ism (they do not know what it is), but out
of sheer love of looting, burning and killing.
“Lawlessness, arson and robbery utterly
lack control. By a Government order of the
day troops commit armed thefts. The Foreign
Office can do nothing, and Ministers are
powerless equally against the unions and the
army. The unions are absolutely supreme.
They are organised and controlled by an
argus-eyed ‘Red political bureau.’ The city
is filled with Russian Bolshevik ‘advisers.’
They are at all corners. They dominate the
political bureau, the labor unions and the
public departments, and they will ultimately
devastate the city if allowed to go on. All
decent Chinese, not to mention all foreigners,
are praying for foreign intervention, or for
anything’which will rid us of this all-destroy-
ing Russian incubus.”
Neither in France, Russia, Hungary nor
China did the Communist turn up to des-
troy “imperialism.” In each country there
had been an empire and an emperor, but
in each country both the institution and
the man had gone to the scrap-heap before
the Communist came looting and scaven-
ging on the scene. He is a curious charac-
ter, and makes a lot of trouble in the world,
though Premier Slang isn't able to see
him. Apparently Premier Slang thinks the
gentleman goes round with his brand upon
him and a full statement of the things that,
his doctrines lead to pinned to his coat-
tail.
Woman, 1927 Model.
“N.K.C.”: We three university women,
representing and practising medicine,
science and law, all in our twenties, were
seated on the beach watching life as
spawned by an excursion train. And quietly,
with the gloves off, we discussed life and
sex as we had found it. Had education
de-sexed us? Why was matrimony not
inviting?
All three of us declared that education
had not de-sexed us, but we had learned
control, and the doc. and I, at any rate,
could find an outlet in hard work. We both
found that we could do our finest intellec-
tual work after we had beaten down a sex
impulse, converting the physical energy
into mental energy. To marry for a home?
Our incomes adequately provided for
homes; in fact, better than the average
man of our age could provide. Passion?
Two of us looked into each other’s eyes
and smiled a crooked smile. Sex without
spiritual comradeship burnt out too soon.
Our whole trouble, analysed down, was
that we were not contented with the half-
loaf. We wanted a man to treat us as a
reasoning creature as well as a physical
mate. We wanted children; but as the
legal member of our trio put it, “The only
way for me to have a child that is legally
mine is for that, child to be illegitimate.
The law does not regard me as the guardian
of a legal child, because I am a woman.”
The whole trouble, we found, was that
we had advanced beyond the “chattel”
stage and that the average male lias not.
Rather, he resents any superiority, mentally
or in sport or otherwise, on our part. When
a girl is lucky enough to get a husband
free from a belief in male prerogatives,
then it is indeed a marriage made in
Heaven.
Somehow then we got on to Wells, the
Dream and—“ We’re getting morbid; come
in for a swim.”
The School and Society.
A generation has passed since the soft
pedagogy which has gradually revolution-
ised our schools, State and non-State, was
ushered in. No longer do school punish-
ment books show “sixers” meted out to
recalcitrant youths; and so frequently does
it happen that no corporal punishment is
administered that inspecting officers rarely
mention such a fact in their reports. Soon
the fact that it is administered at all will
be recorded. If Johnny wastes his time
through inattention, the teacher is told
that his lesson is insufficiently interesting.
During the last decade the psycho-
analysts’ viewpoint has so influenced the
teaching, and the evils of repression have
been so stressed, that some teachers glory
in the license, miscalled liberty, that makes
well-ordered teaching an impossibility. Even
the drill-sergeants are preaching the doc-
trine of individualism, and the teacher is
told that collective movements should be
reduced to a minimum because it is un-
natural to expect one child to accommo-
date his movements to those of another of
different stature.
But educational systems must be judged
by results. In the almost daily exem-
plification of unbridled sex instincts, in
outrages where bestiality sickens and
appals, surely there is an appeal against
further dalliance with the theory that pun-
ishment is almost a wicked thing—that the
real culprit is the community which has
mis-educated the poor evil-doer. Is it
not more than a coincidence that in
America, where freedom for the child (if
not for the adult) has dominated school
thought more than elsewhere, the murder
rate is 77 per million of population?
According to Dr. F. L. Hoffman, Aus-
tralia, with a homicide rate of 18.8 per
million, ranks higher than Switzerland, 1.8;
Holland, 3.1; Scotland, 4.0; Ontario, 5.3;
Quebec, 5.4; England, 7.6; Norway, 8.2;
Ireland, 9.0; Spain, 9.2; N.Z., 9.3; Sweden.
13.2; South Africa, 17.9.
To attribute unsatisfactory social conduct
entirely to educational practice would be
absurd; but more than a self-complacent
view of conditions is needed when it is
realised that the ideal responsible for so
much of modern educational practice is
the worthy one of social adjustment. The
content of school subjects has been altered
materially to make way for matter con-
sidered of greater importance in developing
worthy citizens. To reduce pounds to tons
is no longer a suitable exercise, for a primary
school pupil, because it is claimed to be
too uninteresting and of little use when
the child leaves school. Similarly other
exercises that afforded practice in addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division
have been relegated to oblivion because
the pseudo-psychologist disclaims any
“transfer value” in mathematical training.
Oral reading is of secondary importance to
silent reading, maintain the savants, for-
getting that in expressive oral reading is
revealed intelligent comprehension of what
is read. The results are that business men
bewail the number of incompetent com-
puters entering their offices and substitute,
wherever possible, mechanical contrivances
to do their work; and so careless has the
speech of the Australian youth become that
the enlightened Director of Education in
N. S. Wales has initiated an intensive cam-
paign to improve it.

The ’Bus Missers of Melbourne.
The Allancock Government, to which it
now seems certain that Victoria will say a
not at all regretful good-bye, has been a
wonderful loser of good chances. Even when
Opportunity, instead of waiting to be
seized, burst into the house and took
the Allancock by the hair, that effete
combination would shake itself free and
order the' intruder off the premises. The
Outer Ports question was a striking in-
stance. A Commission gave its mind to
the matter and urged that certain little-
used harbors should have a better chance.
The idea might have involved, in time, a
trifle of railway building, but the immediate
proposition was that each place dealt with
should be put under an elected or mostly-
elected harbor board, given certain rating
powers, and left to work out its own destuiv.
It is a plan which answers well in the
British Isles, while the Australian central-
ising methods don’t work at all except in
boosting capital cities. The necessary bill
would have been no harder to draft than
plenty of other bills; in fact, it could almost
have been copied from British law. Even the
most exhausted Ministry should be capable
of sitting down and watching a port work
out its destiny. But it needn’t have done
even that; it could have gone home to bed.
The scheme was popular in the country,
which had an absurd preponderance o!
voting power, and used some of it to return
both Allan and Peacock. It was the
Allancock’s desire not to disturb this pre-
ponderance, and if it had adopted the Outer
Ports project it might have offered the
plausible excuse that, instead of taking
votes from the country, it was trying to
send voters to the country. Then it could
have added “Wait and see.”
The only explanation is inertia —the
quality which has kept the Pyramids out
of active politics so long.
♦
Bishop Trower, of North Westralia, is in
London on holiday, and his views have been
cabled by some wasteful creature: —
“There are far too many politicians in
Australia, and too few statesmen. ‘Billy’
Hughes, the only big statesman Australia has
produced, was kicked out. Australia’s seven
Parliaments remind me of a comic opera
compared with Britain’s Parliament govern-
ing seven times the population. It is high
time Australia had one centralised Parlia-
ment. That would save millions annually.
The democracy of Australia reminds me of
taking a referendum in a nursery to enable
the kiddies to decide what they will be
taught and who will be the nurse. The
North-West was never a white man's coun-
try,” etc.
When the good man talks of “Britain’s Par-
liament” he is seemingly unaware that the
British Isles have six Parliaments, includ-
ing the two in the Channel Islands, for an
area less than half the size of N. S. Wales.
The whole lot run to about 1900 members,
mostly politicians, and including Jack
Jones, M.P. The biggest Parliament (at
Westminster) has 1455 members, and the
next biggest (at Dublin) has 213 members
for a speck of ground and about 3,000,000
people. The Australians run a continent,
some islands and some mandated territories
with 666 legislators all told, and the Parlia-
ment of all the Commonwealth is not much
more than half the size of the Irish Free
State’s pompous show. It is marvellous how
much ignorance one bishop of Oxford breed-
ing can contain.
♦
Uncle Sam is a very hard person to under-
stand. His latest decision is to abandon his
gentleman’s agreement to act in concert
with the other Powers in Chrna, and go on
his own. The only remark made which looks
anything like an excuse or explanation is that
the new policy will, it is hoped, prove or
inestimable value in holding Chinese trade
and winning more—the “more,” of course,
being that of the Powers now openly offend-
ing the Chinese militarists by their demands
for ordered and civilised conditions. Mean-
time American nationals will continue to
seek safety behind the bayonets of the
associated Powers, without Uncle Sam risk-
ing loss of orders. #
While nearly all the other great cities of
the world have relegated power and light
wires carrying high voltages to underground
conduits, where their killing capacity be-
comes almost negligible, Sydney still has
the old-fashioned and dangerous overhead
system. There is a toll of life every year
from “naked” wires, and the storm which
struck the city and suburbs recently added
considerably to it. Some publicity has been
given to this fact, but none to speak of to
the splendid courage of the men who pre-
vented the casualty-list from growing .at
the risk of their own lives. The storm
destroyed many of the cables carrying
light to suburbs. In the blackness of the
night, with rain drenching them and a furi-
ous wind threatening ladders and wires, the
electrical workmen picked up the broken
threads of the different systems and estab-
lished the services again. As one of their
heads said, they literally took their lives in
their hands. Cremorne Junction, on Syd-
ney’s North Shore, was for many hours a
danger spot which might have claimed many
lives. That it did not was due to the pluck
of the electrical workers, who carried on in
danger and difficulty to make things safe
again for the community. In such emer-
gencies the Australian worker is seen at his
splendid best.
<►
Port Moresby, which has been described as
the shabbiest metropolis in the Pacific, is.
like Canberra, a Federally-owned capital,
where land is held on the leasehold system
and there is a periodical revision of rents.
The first revision happened recently. In 20
years the poiiulation of the townlet grew
from 50 to 500, and this expansion appa-
rently led to inflated ideas. For an allot-
ment with a house on it the figure rose from
£2 to £5O per annum, and the unimproved
value of an acre has been fixed at £2OOO
instead of the old £4O. The inhabitants com-
plain bitterly that they have no voice in
the selection of the Executive Council or
Legislative Council, and that they have no
Federal member as the N. Territory has. In
these respects they are just like the Can-
herraites, but the Canberrait.es can make a
demonstration by mobbing the Governor-
General while the white Papuans can’t.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It may be assumed that the roars and
brawls and baivls and squalls and cat-
clioruses and backbitings and frontbitings of
the Labor Parliamentarians at Sydney are
not improving the State’s position in the loan
market. The party’s ruling body has split
into a small secession conference and a big
conference; and the Premier and one col-
league have gone with the seceders ; and the
Premier has been instructed by the minority
conference to throw his Assembly majority
and the strongest of his colleagues down the
stairs; and 25 members of the Parliamentary
Caucus have ordered the Premier to throw
his fellow-seceder down. When the big
conterenee meets again it is expected that
delegates from the seceding (or Premier’s)
conference will be there to insist on admit-
tance. Should anybody be killed in a scuffle
on the doorstep it will be a misfortune.
The news that the N.S.W. Slangs and
Whangs would remain in office at (or with)
all costs was especially cheering to the
lawyers. It is reckoned that the Slang way
of doing business is worth £20,000 p.a. to the
Devil’s Brigade. The Forty-four Hour Week
Act, which was declared unconstitutional as
regards awards of the Federal Arbitration
Court; the tax on publications, which was
ruled out altogether; the conciliation and
arbitration measure, with its foggy definition
of the powers of conciliation-committee chair-
men ; the squabble between the Premier and
his Education Minister, the rights and
wrongs of which are being probed by a
Supreme Court Judge, assisted by “ a strong
Bar” —these are only some of the juicy
morsels provided for the gentlemen in wigs
and gowns. And the child-endowment legis-
lation is expected to be juicier still.
William McPhairson’s claims to the leader-
ship of the Nationalists, Liberals, etc., in Vic.
Assembly are being examined. McPhairson
was Treasurer for six years under Bowser
and Lawson, and budgeted for surpluses all
the time. For the two years just ending
Vic. will have a deficit of £640,000, and
somebody who can mind the purse carefully
is needed to prevent that £640,000 becoming
a million. McPhairson’s friends are sure he
is the man.
The three members of the North Aus-
tralian Commission are about to start a
perpetual-motion event. They propose to
travel 6000 miles in a six-wheeled car looking
for sites on which to deposit public works.
No difficulty should be experienced, Aus-
tralia being wholly made up of sites, includ-
ing the one on which the s.s. Riverina stands.
Unfortunately, tin; humping of heavy
materials for isolated works is expensive,
and in the absence of railways it is pre-
carious.
Eggleston having thrown in his portfolios,
Vic. Premier Allan becomes an Atlas, sup-
porting, among other things, the Solicitor-
Generalship. Attorney-Generalship and Minis-
tries of Railways, Water Supply and Yal-
lourn. John, however, is an Atlas with liis
feet braced on nothing.
Augwin’s appointment to the London
Agency having left a vacancy in the Westra-
lian Labor Ministry. Caucus has promoted
Sid (really Selby Walter) Munsie to the
(’abinet and named Harold Millington Hon.
Minister in Munsie’s stead. Munsie sits for
Hannans, one of the goldfields pocket
boroughs; Millington wrested the Leederville
seat from a Nationalist in 1924 and held it
last, time against ex-Premier Jack Scaddan.
Plane Bill Johnson, who held high office in
the Dalglish and Scaddan Ministries, was
available, but William has no following in
Caucus nowadays, though able enough and
a veteran of the 1901 vintage.
Labor’s domestic politics in Queensland
are taking on a reflection of those in N.S.W.
The Labor Council, which is not affiliated
with the Central Queensland Labor Execu-
tive, is assuming the attitude of the Seale
Conference; for one thing, it has decided
to set up a committee to select, bright
Red “industrialists” to oppose all sit-
ting Labor members. That, of course, means
a repetition of the N.S.W. snlit over the
A.L.P. rules. The fact is that the A.W.U
is after the scalp of the Queensland Reds,
as it is in N.S.W., and the Council is taking
the familiar course of spoiling the game for
the other fellow, if it can’t win itself.
The monthly stop-work meeting of the
Sydney branch of the Seamen’s Union was
held recently, and the Walsh-Johaiison fac-
tions spoke frankly about each other. A
feature was that the doorkeeper said his fee
of 10s. was an infringement of the basic
wage, and demanded a rise. He was promptly
victimised. In other words, he “got the
boot” there and then.
Maoriland Post and Telegraph Depart-
ment continues to be a money-maker, despite
the return to penny postage and a cheapening
of telegram rates. Progression of surpluses
in the last three financial years has been;
MAROONED.
“Since the stranding of the Riverina, Hobart has no direct communication with Australia, and
the trade of the whole island with the mainland is served by two ancient tubs.”
£293,440; £670,944; £870,666. As revenue
grows expenditure diminishes. The Com-
monwealth ought to send someone over .to
find out how it’s done.
“Bildad”,: I recommend it as a brilliant
idea that every unemployed deputation should
be photographed, so that it could be ascer-
tained. by comparison with previous photo-
graphs, liow often the same unemployed
turned up. It might also be not amiss if
portraits were taken of men whom labor
bureaus and the like send to jobs, so that
it would be easy to identify them when
they make an early or instantaneous return.
This proposition is based on the complaint
of the director of a State bureau at. New-
castle (N.S.W.) that prompt returns average
90 per cent.
A grandiose scheme-—in fact, much too big
a scheme —for doing things with North-West
Australia has gone like a bubble of hydrogen
gas. A ten-million-pound company was to
sow 25,000 square miles of country with
cows and bullocks to begin with, and more
afterwards. It was to establish mammoth
freezing works; to run a weekly service of
oil-driven steamers full of meat to England :
and to do other deeds which Alexander the
Great never dreamt of. Unfortunately the
co. relied on the useful John Bull to guaran-
tee the first five millions’ worth of debentures,
and his advisers told him the project hadn’t a
hope. High finance in a wilderness doesn’t
have one hope to the cubic mile.
It was no very cheerful gathering at which
(lie Prime Minister formally handed back
the long-borrowed Victorian Parliament
Mouse to its owners and took Premier
Allan’s receipt for it. Federal politicians
made some polite remarks about the good
work they had done, and the beauty of the
Constitution, and someone said it was a
touching coincidence that the Parliamentary
opening at Canberra should take place on
the 26tli anniversary of the original opening
at Melbourne. The State members were
too polite to say that they were glad to see
the rival show off the premises, and not one
Federal member declared he wms glad to
shift; in fact, Charlton said he was feeling
pretty miserable over it. Then the crowd
sang “Auld Lang Syne,” and the political
pilgrims put on their snowshoes and took
their alpenstocks and started.
A Sydney Trades Hall deputation got
hold of Premier Lang last week, and told
him it was “dissatisfied with the Government’s
attitude towards the unemployed.” The
miserable Premier had just been at New-
castle, where he explained that his Ministry
w r as spending £12,000,000 a year of borrowed
money on public works to relieve unemploy-
ment; that £3,000,000 was in process of
spending in and around Newcastle alone ; that
2000 men had been sent from the district to
public works elsewhere (though it is alleged
that 90 per cent, of them promptly came
back) ; and that he understood there were
1500 of the workless still hanging around the
coal city. Last returns showed N.S.W. to
be the most unemployed State on the main-
land, and but for the £12,000,000 a year of
loan money it would certainly be worse.
Very soon the State will have to do with
less than £12,000,000, and in the meantime
Lang is kicked by his disgruntled followers
for not finding more. The way of the shifty
truckler is tough.
The uew S. Aus. Premier anticipates a
deficit of £1.127,049. or just over £2 per
inhabitant. In addition there will be "the
loss on the soldier settlement and irrigation
areas and the interest, relating thereto"

I - nul'ions out of revenue and 5 J 2 millions
for jobs which should mostly have been
charged to revenue. By this kind of finance
Adelaide Treasurers have hitherto avoided
the appearance of deficits pretty well, but
now the additional spectre has arrived, and
it is as awkward as the advent of triplets in
a one-roomed house.
Britain possesses an Independent Labor
party, small in a Parliamentary way bul
cast m a heroic mould. At a recent con-
ierence the president, a Scot from the east
end ot Glasgow, outlined a policy which
included a strike for an all-round 20 per
increase of wages, and an allowance
of £2oo per annum apiece to the unem-
xroo'mc se ? ms a l»ty not to have made it
ioOt). 1 here is no sense in boggling at trifles.
The Queensland Unemployment Insurance
concern is now in its fourth year and it has
been found necessary to increase by one-third
the contributions of the State, the employer
and the regular employee, making them 4d.
instead of 3d. per week, and to raise the
levy for casuals from id. to Id. per day.
V ery early the revenue showed a tendency to
diminish and the outgoings to increase. The
brief record from March, 1923, to June, 1926,
was this
Accumu-
Income. Outgoings. Surplus, lation.
Nine months.. £283;033 £158,638 £124,895 £124,395
Year 1924-25 249,106 204,538 44,568 168,963
Year 1925-26 256,976 248,301 8,675 177,638
Without going into exact figures, Minister
Gledson states that the diminishing surplus
has turned into a deficit, and that in the past
10 months expenditure has beaten revenue
in a canter. How much is due to decline in
the number of solvent contributors and how
much to increase of distressed pensioners he
doesn’t say.
Ramsay Macdonald and Co. promise to
put up such a fight as there hasn’t been
since Marathon against the Baldwin bill
which prohibits compulsory levies oil union-
ists in support of Labor, or possibly Com-
munist, candidates, and the besieging of
non-strikers’ houses to terrorise the inmates
into joining a strike. If the British artisan
is not at liberty to be coerced in these ways,
it is held that the torch of freedom will be
definitely extinguished. To party members
or prospective members it will certainly be
an annoying business if it is no longer pos-
sible to levy on the unions for election funds,
but what the unionists would say if they
expressed their views by secret ballot is
another matter.
Maioriland is worried again about its
financial health. For the 12 months ended
March last imports exceeded exports in value
by two and a half millions, and the quarterly
bank averages assessed at the end of March
showed an excess of advances over deposits
of nearly five and a quarter millions. Import-
ing hasn’t been so heavy as in the previous
year, when the export total was exceeded by
four and one-third millions, but the debt to
the banks has increased by over one and a
half millions. Part of the story is an over-
seas bill for interest amounting to about five
millions a year, which doesn’t figure in the
trade returns. The Dominion pegs along
on what it can borrow from Father John,
but it isn't, happy. To be thoroughly happy
it would have to move westward 1200 miles.
Some sort of parallel might be drawn
between Lang of Sydney and Chiang of
Canton, but the cases don't fit very well.
Kach man found that the power was slipping
from his hands into those of the unions, and
that Red influences bossed the unions. Chiang
had Eugene Chen sitting on his back, and
Lang had Garden and Willis. Then the
resemblance left off, for Lang left his own
forces and went to join the Reds, though he
tried to explain the matter away after-
wards, while Chiang lost his temper and
sooled troops on to his lot of disturbers, of
whom he seems to have made a considerable
• mess. The result is that his enemies have
declared Chiang deposed and offered a price
for his head, while his one-time friends think
of deposing Lang and offering a reward for
his drooping tail.

A LAY OF HOPE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Don robes of hope with promise blent, fling
off your sable hoods of care
And drive your pegs and pitch your tent
against the walls of Parliament,
Whose portals grace a prospect fair!
Behold the planted avenues of nursling
pines and cedars growing;
Of shrubs which shed abundant hues and
leaves that cup the silver dews
While morning winds are bravely blowing!
The silver bands in massed array grand har-
mony shall trumpet wide
To wake the purple calm of May, proclaim
an epic holiday
And every doubt and care deride.
Lound policy that sunders fate and major
ton es declamatory
Shall yet engage with learned debate to
shape the grave affairs of State
In sessions of our future glory.
Warm hearts shall bless each brighter year
by fairer policy controlled,
While dreamers. shape and builders rear
sound monuments of purpose clear,
Till spite and error are consoled.
When regal words have run their leaf and
fervid praise and prayer are ended,
We’ll stride asunder fear and grief to drive
the share and reap the sheaf
And store with pride our harvest splendid.

“Strict Veg.”: The Jane Wright, Victoria’s
steam trawler, while out looking for the
Lenten supply of fish, fetched up a sea-lion.
There being no demand for sea-lion in Mel-
bourne at present, the crew let it find its
own way back whence it came.
“G.8.L.”: Hidden away
in the rugged and almost in-
accessible ranges between
Brindabella and Kiandra, on
the south-western boundary
of the Federal Capital Terri-
tory, is a remarkable water-
fall. Coroner John Gale and
William Reid, of Queanbe-
yan, discovered it in 1875,
and the. former has given an
account of it in a booklet en-
titled “Six Days on the
Mountains of Cowley.” After
describing the country where
the Murrumbidgee has its
source, and devoting some
attention to the fauna and
flora and the traces of pre-
vious explorers, the writer
makes mention of this water-
fall among the mountains,
which he calculated to have
a drop of “at least 1200
feet.” If this is correct, the
so-called Cotter Falls must
be among the loftiest in the
world, as only a very few
waterfalls exceed 1000 feet in
height. But apparently, no
other white men have seen
them since the discoverers, 52
years ago. Several bushmen
who know this country pretty
well have told me that they
have never come across the
fall. There will be a fine
•chance for some of our poli-
ticians to rediscover them
during the long week-ends.
“E.M.”: “Topee” fancies that the original
John Dunn, who provided- a cant name for
the pound-note, was "high up in the Bank
of N.S.W. in the ’seventies” (B. 21/4/ 2i).
I think he is wrong. About 48 years ago
I was junior ledger-keeper in the Commercial
Bank of Tasmania at Hobart, and on one
occasion I had to make a search through
old-time vouchers for the credit-slip ot a
deposit that had been unclaimed for over
30 years. Whilst diving in the voucher
boxes I fluked the original tellers cash-book,
dated 1832. In those days the daily trans-

It does not kill immediately, the period ot
agony being long or short according to the
amount used, but there is never any chance ot

of the wild taro root for homicidal purposes.
This is a quick poison which leaves the

“Jim Domino”: When the Duke and
Duchess were passing up Swanston-street,
Melbourne, there was one impromptu greet-
ing that made them both sit up and take
pleased notice. It floated down from one
of the workmen on St. Paul’s spire, just
when the Royal carriage was directly undci-
neath, and consisted merely of two words:
“Lucky Albert!” But the fervor in it was
unmistakable. ,

“Sol Malaprop” : These parts still special-
ise in producing heirs to large, mysterious
piles of wealth. The latest batch of claim-
ants, scattered over Australia and Main-
land, are in pursuit of the “millions which
have accumulated through the rash action
of “Edward Webber, an eccentric Dutch
merchant, who. two centuries ago, left a
fortune to his descendants ot the seventh
generation.” Despite civil and foreign wars,
invasions, the annexation of the country,
despite looting by Bonapartes and others,
embezzlement, conflagration, and the tiantic
efforts of intermediate generations to upset
the will, it is assumed that, the golden heap
has remained intact and, under the care ot
honest guardians, doubtless named Schnapps,
is ready to be handed over. Somebody is
going to England to investigate, as per usual.

“C.Q.”: As soon as the crowds began to
thicken for the Anzac Day procession m
Melbourne, lorries packed with kerosene-tins,
barrels and fruit-cases drove to the salient
points and proceeded to sell "private grand-
stands” at a flat price of os. apiece. Ihe
briskest trade was done on lrinces Biid»e,
and when the crowd began to clear away
the road was found to be packed with
the obstacles. The buyers had no furthei
interest in their property, the purveyors weic
driving home counting their gains am
police force was quite inadequate to make
any impression on the litter, so the mob
surged over it and the traffic ploughed
through it. Finally a narrow passage-way
was cleared for vehicles, but for a long time
afterwards the usual street sounds were
punctuated bv the curses of motor drivers
suffering from penetrated tyres and the
desolating howls of infants impaled on nail-
studded boards. But I noticed a strongly-
hooped keg which a family of five was
faking turns in trundling home through
Alexandra Gardens.
“E.C.” : Nothing can be kept secret long in
these days. The Post Office people have dis-
covered that the war is over. It came about
when someone tried to send a parcel of gold
through the post and was told it couldn t be
done. But the sender wanted to know whv
and was so persistent that the Post Office
looked into the legal aspect of the case. In the
course of its researches it found the pro-
hibition was a war-time measure to prevent
capital leaving the country, and further in-
quiry elicited that the war in question had
now concluded. The discovery has quite
upset the P.O.
“C.Q.” : A retired Victorian bank manager
put up a novel defence in a local court the
other day when charged with the offence ot
not having sent his eight-year-old twins to
school. He pointed out that he lived 14
miles from the nearest seminary and that the
only route lay along the Dandenong-road, a
favorite thoroughfare of speeding motorists,
lie added that he daily relinquished three
older children to the untender mercies or the
world, but the twins were the apple ot his
eye and he was afraid. The beak adjourned
the charges for three months, presumably in
the hope that motor hogs would become
civilised or that the twins would become more
expert at dodging them.

“Elgar”: On a recent bright afternoon,
at Melbourne’s nearly-busiest corner, a den
berate and somewhat wobbly pedestrian sought
to cross the street in front of the oncoming
traffic. He had successfully cleared a Bam
when a big touring-car got him, and lie went
under. Men swore and women shrieked as
they saw him being dragged along on his
back. The car didn’t stop untd two-scor,
yards had been covered—because it couldn t ,
the victim had got his boot jambed between
the clutch and some of the brake gear. Attei
a John Hop had saved the driver from bein*
lynched and someone had rung up an ambu-
lance, the unfortunate struggled up on one
leg, dusted the rear of his pants, and plnm-
tively urged someone to rescue his othei
leg from under the car. It was badly frac-
tured, and had eventually to be chopped out
of the up-ended machine. But the owners

ficial one! •
THE SUPER MANNEQUIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mannequin required, with a handsome figure,
heavy proportions, 40in. bust, 33in. waist, weight
12 to 13 stone.” —S. M. H kkai.l) ad.
Wanted—no eel-hipped sylph, no slender
Psyche,
No fragile, fluttering, airy fairy queen,
No willowy Rebecca, such as Ikey
Fell for —the Hebrew patriarch, I mean.
So she be only good to look on, Crikey!
She may be twelve good stone or eke
thirteen.
The genus Mannequin, one may compute,
Runs in all sorts and shapes, and weights
to boot.
Time was an Amaryllis or Nesera
Was sought to demonstrate how fashions
fit;
But this is quite a plump and pleasing era
In figures feminine, you must admit,
And here’s an opening for a massive Hera,
Ample as Zeus’ dame, to do her bit
And pose, caparisoned and trapped, to show
Fat, fair and forty what is com me il faut.
Who drives fat oxen must himself be —frayed
is
The proverb, anyhow, and old as sin.
Put it: Who clothes the frames of buxom
ladies
Can’t have his human models all as thin
As Madame Sara Bernhardt. No, by Hades!
Wanted- —a five-meal, meat-fed Mannequin.
Provided it’s symmetrically placed
It doesn’t matter much about her waist.
Wanted, some hall of haberdasli to brighten,
One-eighty pounds or so of shapeliness.
Will she not bulk a veritable Triton
Among the minnows V Obviously, yes.
Still, fewer blouses and the like will tighten
To give their panting purchasers distress
When their dimensions have had trial good
On thirteen stone of bouncing womanhood.

T. THE R.


"Celia Lloyd” : A recent Bulletin picture
presented a stowaway who, ordered to “Jet
go the jib sheet,” promptly answered that
“lie wasn’t touching it.” If my memory
serves, the original of the story was no
stowaway, but one of the shipping-office
elerks, sent to assist good old Captain
Skater to move one of the black-birding fleet
then out of Bundaberg during the maritime
strike of the early ’nineties. A rough dia-
mond was Skater. Old sailors never hesi-
tated about signing on with him, but just
about this time his A.B.'s were largely cab-
drivers, dead-beats and ' the like, and he
generally rose to the occasion in dealing
with them. I remember one occasion when
the crew sent the perfectly good “full and
plenty” food aft by two Brisbane loafers,
with the question, “Is that good and fit
tor men to eat?” I was rather surprised
1° hear the skipper reply, “Of course, it’s
no) fit for men to eat.” “Why do we have
1o eat it, then?” demanded thug No. 1. “Why,
'hum) it all. you’re not men.” said Skater,
adding "but you will be by the end of this
' rip. And they had certainly advanced some
stages in the direction indicated when lie
paid them off.
' L.E, : The most delightful after-dinner
sp :aker 1 ever heard was a Victorian shire
president. This worthy was presiding at a
banquet given in honor of a visiting digni-
tary and was evidently determined that
everyone should know lie had paid for it all
out of his own pocket. Surveying his well
Jed bucolic guests at the festive board, he
turned to the high personage and observed
grimly: "None ot these blokes put in any-
thing to help me." He omitted to add that
he had eased the financial strain a little by
selling his own ducks and turkeys to tin
caterer.
“N.K.C. : Touching the comparatixe
imperviousness to pain of uncivilised races
(B. 7/4/’27), I have noticed the same
characteristic in feeble-minded children. Tim
duller intelligence seems to ensure the pos-
sessor a less sensitive pain centre. I remem
her one youngster of this type, whose hand
had been severely burned, cheerfully un-
wrapping the doctor’s bandages in the frosty
yard to show the other children. The epi-
leptic, on the other hand, appears to be par-
ticularly sensitive to pain: 1 have known one

“Bouragi” : Not without good reason has
the missionary won the reputation of being a
humorless cuss. One Barradale, just returned
from a long tour of inspection of L.M.B.
missions in the Western Pacific, has been
singling out Gilbert Islanders for special
praise in his statements to the press. These
noble savages, who once fought fearful battles
by sea and land, clad in coco-matting “mail"
and armed with swords and clubs edged with
shark-teeth, are certified by Barradale as
being possessed of “grit, high intelligence
and eommonsense, with intense pride of
race.” But, added the evangelist, regretfully,
they didn t take kindly to Christianising.
There was a greater proportion of pagans
among them than anywhere else in the
Pacific, though the Gospel had been preached
to them for many years. That there was
any connection between the Gilbertians’ high
intelligence and eommonsense and their per-
sistence in declining to be converted to a
faith they couldn’t understand did not.
apparently, occur to their reverend admirer.

"Flagwagger" : The humorist who sets men
to work digging holes and filling them up
again, or turning a grindstone aimlessly,
isn t always a squatter. Melbourne employers
who engage in the road-carrying trade must
give any casual hand at least one week’s work,
or, failing that, sufficient money to make up
a xveek s wages. Such carriers frequently
get a rush of business that lasts no more
than a few days; and so. after putting on
new drivers, they have no work for them
after the rush is over. Many send off the
idle hands with a week's wages, but one cap-
tain of industry has solved the problem of
avoiding this expense. lie sets the idle men
to work continuously shutting, bolting, un-
bolting and opening the yard gates, and he
keeps an eye on them to see that they don’t
loaf. Even the most determined soon find
the unnecessary and monotonous job to be
torture and sack themselves, though they for-
feit their right to a full week's pay thereby.

"N.K.C.” : Just as Amsterdam was “built
on the bones of the herring” so Portland
(Vic.) arose on the vertebrae of the whale.
Ninety years ago. when the lleuty brothers
first made it their headquarters, the sight of
half a dozen whales sporting about in Port-
land bay was a frequent one. Some 40 years
back a seismic earthquake disturbance oc-
curred in Bass Strait. At Port Fairy and
Warrnambool the shock felt was particularly
severe. This upheaval changed the direction
of the cold drift from the Southern Ocean
which brought the whales: nowadays a
warmer Pacific drift-current flows into Port-
land Bay. This was the death-blow to the
whale industry, although occasionally a stray
whale gives the place a call. The present
town is built on the claws of the cray; old
decaying sheds and rusty boilers are the only
relics of the original industry.

“C.Q.” : A party of innocent tourists had the
adventure of their lives on an exposed ridge
of the Victorian Alps recently. Never had
they dreamed how rapidly u blizzard, mainly
composed of sheets of ice, could dismantle
three motor-cars. In a few minutes there was
little left but the framework, the rest being
swept over the 1000-foot precipice to the
edge of which they clung. As the cars threat-
ened to follow tneir spare parts, the men of
the party decided to get the women to shelter,
which was only 20 feet distant. They made
the distance, but only after a prolonged
struggle and at the risk of being blown into
the Ovens River, far below. It was a wild
night they spent huddled in a road-patrol
hut.

“Caveman” : Adelaide has shown almost as
much lack of originality as Melbourne
(B. 14/4/’27) in christening its suburbs.
Cockney names are common, and the resi-
dents of quite picturesque localities see
nothing strange in living in Kent Town, Step-
ney or Mile End. One bunch of streets I
know are labelled Eton, Harrow, Winchester,
Charterhouse and so on : another area per-
petuates the memory of a series of Melbourne
Cup winners. Yet other thoroughfares have
the names of P. and O. or Orient steamers
affixed to them. Presumably it was some-
body from the original Lambeth who inflicted
on a defenceless street in Colonel Light
Gardens the name of “Laxnbeth-walk.” I
never encountered a Limehouse in Adelaide,
but there may be one.
* * -.l=
“Flagwagger” : I know one confirmed shop-
lifter who picks up all manner of articles for
no other purpose than making gifts to friends.
In France during the 1916 winter I opened a
parcel to find a bonzer pair of socks, a note
UNCLE SAM’S DISASTER.
“Hundreds of lives have been lost, tens of thousands of people are homeless, and millions of
dollars of damage have been caused by floods! in the Mississippi Valley.”
AUSTRALIA: “A bad business, In etc Ham, and I’m sorry for you. Still, you ought to
be darned thankful that you’ve got a Mississippi .”
of good wishes, and the address of the sender,
who is the lady in question. I met her upon
returning from the war, and she casually
mentioned that the material from which those
socks were made had cost her nothing; also
that I was only one of many Diggers, whose
homes were in her district and whose adresses
she had obtained from their friends, who had
received socks made from wool she had pur-
Joined from a large store. This queer person
does not only lift from shops. When visiting
friends she will pick up anything near at
hand unless closely watched, merely to give
them to other friends. Many have for this
reason debarred her their homes; but others,
more kindly, say nothing to her and exchange
gifts. Incidentally, when the influenza epi-
demic raged throughout Australia some years
ago she was one of the good people who
established a depot where soup and other
food was cooked for sufferers who could not
gain entrance to the overcrowded hospitals
and to the children of those who were in hos-
pital. There was no more willing worker
tlifln the woman who, if caught shop-lifting,
will probably go to prison.
*.* * *
“Caveman” : In the breaking-up yard of an
Adelaide firm which deals extensively in dis-
carded motor-cars unconsidered trifles are
liable to come to light, although ’buses sold for
the scrapheap have generally been well ran-
sacked. An old French Bayard with dee])
cushions yielded up an umbrella and a small
doll; in another vehicle were discovered a
purse with a few coppers and a flask of
brandy. Imported cushions, being soft, cause
the dropped articles to lie quiet. Stray coins
and pencils are the most common find, but
sometimes a small item of jewellery is dug
up from the folds of the upholstery. The
pockets of the doors are not always empty,
either. In tlm tool pocket of an old Ford
car a mechanic of my acquaintance unearthed
a valuable small folding camera buried under
a tight wad of old cotton-waste.
* * * *
“Bouragi” : There is no evidence whatever
of any older race in New Guinea than the
Papuan (B. 21/4/’27) unless it be the pygmy
tribes of the central range. Many years of
scientific investigation indicate that the true
Papuan has pushed coastwise from the in-
terior, and has preserved his type intact on
both sides and the middle of the island.
There is a notable exception in the ease of
the so-called Melanesian Wedge, which drove
up through the Louisades and D’Entrecas-
teaux groups from Melanesia, to create the
Papu-Melanesian. This' invasion has left
plain tracks behind it, and has penetrated
along the s.-w. Coast as far as the begin-
nings of the Gulf of Papua, and, in a lesser
degree, along the n.-e. coast. That is the
only instance of the invasion of New
Guinea b” an alien race which has stood
the test of scientific scrutiny.
“K.D.S.”: The other week a Balranald
(N.S.W.) squatter got a duck-bone in his throat.
A medical specialist and a nurse were rushed
from Melbourne by aeroplane, and by dint of
X-rays and all the newest surgical methods
the offending bone was removed. Sixty years
ago there was a very similar accident in the
same district. A nurse of the old school was
summoned by a distracted relative, and for a
moment she was nonplussed. But it seemed
as if the stricken man must clioke unless
something was done, and, looking round, she
picked out a stout crochet hook from some
woolwork lying on a table. This instru-
ment she pushed down the patient's neck. It
•caught in the obstruction and the bone came
up; it had to. There were no bad after
effects, and the operation cost nothing.
* * * *
“Q.M.1.”: General Ryrie, who is to be the
next High Commissioner, is reputed a hard
man to bluff, but it has been done. In 1900,
when lm was Captain Ryrie, O.C. Austra-
lian details at Maitland, near Capetown, he
demanded an office orderly. Having somehow
acquired cash “pays” were very patchy in
those days--I was resplendent in a new
rig-out, and was nailed on that account
by the camp S.M. Duty consisted in sit-
ting on a box in the hot sun outside the
office-door and obeying an occasional sum-
mons. I acquired by purchase a batman’s
pass which permitted the bearer to go to and
from Capetown; so I naturally hired a
substitute orderly, one being found for half
a crown a day, and ss. to the C.S.M. The
only change the O.C. noted was the absence
of the shiny new uniform. It had been
stolen, it was explained, presumably by the
14 Hussars details, who “lay” alongside us;
and there the matter dropped.
* * * *
“Sierra”: Years ago seamen used to doctui
damp matches by holding them for a few
moments against an artery in the armpii.
Recently I saw an old busliman use almosi
the same method with a wax match whicl
had been soaked in water for about two
minutes. Baring his arm lie gently rubbed
the match along the artery that coursed over
his biceps, and although most of the head
came away in a blue streak, the little that
was left burst into flame readily enough
when struck on the box. Perhaps there is
no scientific basis for this practice, but rub-
bing the match on other parts of the body,
or, as is usual, in the hair of the head, does
not seem to have the same magical effect.
* * * *
“Herodot”: How hard some of these old
superstitions die! I know a man whose most
valued possession is a small piece of rop*
with which a soldier was hanged in the early
part of the last century for robbing the
Government stores at Sydney. It is the firm
belief of the owner of the relic that it will
ward off sickness and disease of any kind,
and in support he instances the fact that hi
has never suffered a day’s illness, and that
his father, wdio bequeathed the grisly curio
to him, enjoyed the same immunity from
fleshly ills and only succumbed to old age.
* "-!= * *
“Nikko” : A Maoriland shopkeeper glued a
half-sovereign to his wooden counter, and
thereby provided for himself and his staff a
never-failing source of entertainment. Cus-
tomer after customer would sidle over to tin
gold and make a furtive effort to annex it.
and when the onlookers beheld an opulent
looking woman scrabbling under the fold-
of her fur which she had carelessly cast
on the counter they knew they had only to
wait until her expression of studied inno-
cence would merge into disgust. The shop-
keeper maintained that the anchored half-
sovereign was the best index to charade)
possible, and also that the person who tried
most perseveringly to get it off was the wife
of a well-to-do parson. One day a poorly
clad woman called in and asked for a small
supply of goods on credit. As she was not
known, her request was refused. On the way
out she noticed the gold coin on the counter.
Without waiting to investigate she called tin
attention of an assistant to it before passing
out. “Call her back,” said the boss, hastily,
“and let her have what she wants. I’ll
back her to pay all right.” When the coin
did vanish at last a large chip from the
counter went with it.
* * * *
"Oartot”: The blind, as well as deaf
mutes, develop extra senses to make up for
tlip lost one (B. 21/4/’27). I know a blind
woman who lias such an extraordinary sens''
of touch that she can tell the color of any
object placed in her hand, provided that
the color is one of those belonging to the
spectrum. Thus*- she can distinguish be-
tween red and yellow, but hues like vieux
rose or pink baffle her. She has no idea
of how she does it. saying simply that she
can tell by the “feel” of the color: the
explanation doubtless is that these simple
colors emit definite rays capable of being
distinguished by those in whom the necessary
sensitivity has been developed.
* * * *
"Her Jong” : The color prejudice has been
drawn in a new place in South Africa. The
white nurses at the hospital in that Matc-
hing which gave a new verb to the language
have struck against being professionally
associated with a Kaffir doctor. The latter
is a fully-qualified medico, with European
degrees; but when lie sent along a young
white girl to be prepared for a major opera-
tion. the ministering angels ruffled their
feathers up. Of course, the politicians can’t
keep out of it. and the Hutch Nationalist
parliamentarians have cabled congratulations
to the infuriated females. That whites
should patronise a nigger doctor in a country
like South Africa is cause for wonderment,
but possibly he is cheaper than the white
quacks, and economy knows no race-
prejudice.
* * *
“The Listening Insect”: The Air Force
radio braneh continues to be a pioneer. I'
pioneered short-wave communication with
Britain and developed it to the point where
it could save the taxpayer hundreds of pounds
annually by exchanging its own messages
with the British Air Force people, instead of
handing them to the cable companies. Its
latest move is to get in proper touch with
its own personnel while in the air. In a
recent night flight to Sydney the adventurers
chatted with their colleagues on the earth
from beginning to end of the expedition, a
remarkable radio achievement. The force of
planes which curtseyed to the Duke during
the arrival ceremony in Melbourne was all
the time in direct communication with head-
quarters at Point Cook, and the news of the
crashing of two of the fliers reached the re-
sponsible authorities almost before the burn-
ing machines and their four occupants had
reached the ground.

“Coot”: Suitable street nomenclature?
Fitzroy, Melbourne’s “shooting” suburb, has
its Gore and Little Gore streets.

“Charles Pritchard” (Esperanee. W.A.) :
In The Bulletin (3/3/’27) “G.8.L." has
a paragraph on the wreck of the Walter
Hood in Wreck Bay (N.S.W.) on April —<*».
IS7O. He tells of a Sydney boy named
Charles Pritchard who swam ashore after a
West Indian black had accomplished the feat.
I am the C.P. in question. I left Sydney for
London in 1869 in the clipper Tliyatira.
a lad of 15, and was returning in the
Walter Hood. The colored man who first
reached the shore was named Roland Mac-
pherson ; he swam out and assisted me to
land when I was nearly exhausted. He
also assisted two passengers, the brothers
J. D. and J. ’S. Smith. The only other
passenger was a Mr. Haynes, who was
drowned. It was not the s.s. lllalong
which took the crew off the wreck —she was
unable to get alongside owing to heavy seas
—but the Government steamer Thetis,
which arrived later with a lifeboat and
crew, and rescued the survivors, taking tiicri)
to Sydney. Before this, 10 of us had reached
the shore. We found nine bodies, including
that of Captain Latto, and buried them m
two graves in the sand.
WHEN WINTER COMES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When winter comes, with bitter nights,
A sea that sobs, a breeze that bites.
Behold our bleak, deserted shore!
We hear wild waves in anger roar.
Gone are our lively water-sprites,
In iridescent gowns or tights.
No gramophone to jazz incites,
Nor mermaid flappers cry "Encore!”
When winter comes.
But soon, in spring, bewitching sights
On yellow sands of Nereid rites
Will tempt the festive visitor.
Lovers will walk in pairs once more,
And praise our beach for all delights,
Till winter comes.
VICTORIA.

“L.R.” : Is there no limit to the uses of the
hairpin? There is an electric lift in Pitt-
wtreet. Sydney, noted for its idiosyncrasies,
-me of which is imprisoning people between
doors. The lady driver, however, can always
coax it to start again by reaching through
the lattice work of the cage and touching the
active principle, or whatever it is. She
avoids electrocution by attaching the hair-
pin to a lead pencil.
“Strict Veg.”: St. Kilda (Vic.) staged its
most wonderful motoring escape the other
day. A closed car skidded off the road, hit
a stone wall, somersaulted no less than
three times, and came to rest finally with
its feet feebly waving in the air. A horrified
spectator rushed over to count the dead, but
failing to open the door, tore off to the
nearest police-station for assistance. The
relief party arrived just in time to see the
four "victims, apparently none the worse,
for the adventure, driving off down the street.
"Lao-dah” : Just as Albert and his rather
charming missus were on the point of pass-
ing. a short woman with a determined eye
and a nose like a marline-spike pushed her
way through the crowd standing in St.
Kilda-road almost to the front row. and un-
folding a paper parcel disclosed to the
startled gaze of the surrounding loyalists an
object about which there could be no doubt
at all. It was half a brick. Uneasy inur
; uirs arose from the crowd, and a constable,
making two swift, agitated strides, shouted
at her menacingly. “’Ere. what are you
going to do with that?” “Stand on it,” said
the lady sweetly. Whereupon she suited the
action to the word and the crisis passed.
* * * *
“X.D.” ; Three charges of assault were set
down for hearing in a Melbourne court the
other day. A wife charged her husband
with unlawful assault, the husband charged
a. young man who had been employing his
wile as housekeeper with assault of the
plain variety, and the young man counter-
attacked with a charge of assault against
the husband. All the charges were dismissed,
but when the young man and the wife
stepped out into the sunshine they were
served with divorce papers.

“Centurion”: Perusal of one of the circu-
lars issued to British troops at Shanghai,
inciting them to mutiny, suggests that the
Canton-Soviet combine has engaged an
Amurrican publicity expert. “British soldiers :
Why stick the rotten life and conditions at,
Shanghai?.... Why, for a lousy dollar a
day. murder inoffensive, half-starved Chinese
workers in their heroic fight?.... It’s a
cad’s game, Tommy.... Tell the brass-liats
and bosses where they get off.. . . Give the
hard-faced baby-starvers a kick in the pants
.... Support the revolution.” Unless the
English regular has changed since the days
of the Boer War, when the writer, at one time
or another, “lay” with most of the “Old Con-
temptibles,” horse, foot and guns, there is
one serious flaw in this stirring appeal. That
is the use of the word “Tommy” in direct
address. In the writer’s experience, the
British soldier loathes it.
* * * •
“The Listener-In”: Radio fanatics in this
country who try to tune in to concerts from
abroad have a heavy cross to bear in the
shape of the ignoramus—he is seldom
deliberately wicked- —who allows his receiver
to radiate, thus filling God’s air with moans,
sighs and elfin screams. The same incon-
siderate person has so exasperated listeners
in England that the authorities have taken
special measures to cope with him. A wire-
less van cruises in a suspected neighborhood
until it picks up the tell-tale sounds, and
estimates the general direction of the source.
Then it drifts up and down the street until
the offender’s house is definitely located.
THE OHARM OF VARIETY.
“Don't you know any other step besides this one?"
“Sure I do—kick willi the other foot.”
The owner, when charged, usually protests
indignantly, but a little technical instruction
on the functions of oscillation and reactance
generally cures him. This aerial detective
force nabs an average of six delinquents a
week.
THE SURE SION.
“Simpson is thinking very seriously about marriage lately .”
“Ah! How long has he been married?”
“Oxmead”: According to the “Jacobites,”
who publish a little paper in M.L., the
senior living member of the Stuart family,
and hence the rightful sovereign of Great
Britain and Ireland, is an aged Bavarian
princess or ex-princess. It would be difficult,
one would imagine, even for Jacobites to
stir up much sentimental enthusiasm for this
vague person, and, anyhow, the Stuarts are
a mushroom clan in England compared with
others whose “royal” rights might be held
to possess a certain academic interest. Some-
body has recently unearthed in the Cold
Country an Essex farm-laborer who claims
to be a lineal descendant of Earl Godwin,
father of Harold, England’s last Saxon king.
This hind of ancient lineage is said to have
satisfied massive genealogical experts (like
the parson in “Tess of the Durbervilles”)
that his claim is perfectly well-grounded.
When “the Gold Dragon of the Wessex kings
on Hastings field went down,” this branch
of the Godwins, it seems, took to the land
and has stayed with immense tenacity and
enthusiasm among the wheat and the tur-
nips for eight centuries. There is nothing
inherently improbable in the story—there
are yeoman families in England who can
trace back their pedigree further than anyone in
the peerage, and some of them have been
on the same bit of land since the Conquest.

“Tubercular”: When the Duke of York
visited the Caulfield Military Hospital the
other day every bed patient in the institution
with the exception of the t.b. men in Ward
7 received a Royal handshake. It; was a
piece of cruel discrimination that should
never have been sanctioned by the Repatria-
tion Commission. I was one of the t.b.
invalids who received a nod in lieu of a hand-
shake, and it hurt. God knows I’m clean
enough to shake hands even with a prince.

“Parakiore”: Touching the gift of second-

Maori tohungas (B. 7/4/'27). f believe
1 am one of the few surviving pakehas who
have been initiated in the weird cult; and

is telepathy and hypnotism. Numerous
authentic instances of telepathy could be
cited; in the early days the Maori never
resorted to smoke-signals, yet his bush tele-
graph was most efficient over extraordinary
distances. Hypnotism is the first thing
taught to the young initiate of tohungaism.
I could tell of many instances of “second-
sight,” but as Timi Kara once remarked to
me, “Why is it so extraordinary? Elijah
possessed the gift, why not the tohunga?”

“Lao-dah”: The farmer who asked The
Buixetin Service Department. the legal
situation with regard to fences might learn
something from a sad example outside Cooma
(N.S.W.). Farmer A of that high alpine,
district asked neighbor B to co-operate in
building a new dividing fence between their
two properties. B refused, but, as soon as A
began building the fence a foot within his
side of the boundary, B, not to be outdone,
began to build another, a foot inside his. The
fencing duet went grimly on. but A finished
first. When B finished he was presented
with a bill for one and a half fences, tin
law in the meantime having decided that he
was obliged to share the cost of A's fence.
The quaint bit of pasture, not quite wide
enough to graze a fat sheep and two or
three miles long, may be seen on the right
hand side of the road to Kosciusko.

“0. Bumpkin”: On January 18, 1890. a
steamer en route from Melbourne to Sydney
paid a violent call on the coast near Gabo,
not far from where the Riverina is now
pounding. Her four passengers were tran-
shipped to Sydney by another steamer, while
her officers and men camped on the beach
watching her go to pieces. A man who re-
members the occasion vividly is S. J. Priest-
ley, of Moreland (Vic.). He was sent by the
Vic. Government to attend to Customs affairs,
and in riding from Bairnsdale through the
dense jungle was nearly eaten by dingoes.
The ship belonged to the Lund line and by a
curious chance was called Riverina, too.

“Oran”: Jay Peas haven’t a monopoly of
crass ignorance. In Sydney the other day.
after a rather important case in the Supreme
Court, the jury retired to consider their ver-
dict. The foreman was making a few
remarks upon the evidence when a meek-
looking little colleague interrupted him.
“Excuse me, sir,” he said, “but wliat is a
plaintiff?”
POETIC SOCKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The socks of masculine Sydney are a poem in
themselves.” — A Sydney girl in Brisbane Cocrirr.
O singing socks of Sydney
If waves your notes could drown
They’d set the Harbor bubbling,
O socks of Sydney town !
We deemed them once prosaic,
What drapers call half-liose ;
These are too warm and vibrant
And glittering for prose.
The hoofs that on the pavement
From morn to night are set
Are clad in ode and sonnet,
Rondeau and triolet.
’Twixt shoes and tight-reefed shin-tube
The color schemes compel
Thoughts of a stately ballade
Or dancing villanelle.
Glimpses of silken lyrics
One gets ’neath ferry seats.
That seem to echo Swinburne
Or sort of click with Keats.
And there, mosaic-patterned,
Are socks that memories raise
Of Tennyson declaiming
His hollow o’s and a’s.
Zigzags and convolutions.
One almost hears them sound
Like dithyrambs of Kipling
Or slabs of Ezra Pound.
O knuts and beaus pavonine
Whose hose at best are halves,
The place for metric stockings
Is on symmetric calves.
O rhythmic socks of Sydney,
You’ve gotten poesy down
Till it can go no lower,
O socks of Sydney town !

Income in the Ordinary branch was com-
fortably in excess of the previous year’s, and
the management succeeded in cutting back
expenditure. Young offices which are scratch-
ing desperately for business must wonder
bow it is done. Expenses last year touched
ihe remarkably low level of 7.7 p.c. of total
income, compared with 7.S p.c. for 1920,
S p.c. for 1924, 8.4 p.c. for 1923 and 8.9 p.c.
for 1920. It is in the office's capacity to
inn its business economically that the secret
of its success mainly lies. Having con-
quered that difficulty in its early years, it
was fairly easy to build solidly later on.
'Clie result has been that, if the M.L.C.
proprietors have gleaned golden grain, policy-
holders have also benefited immensely.
Almost every one of the insurance companies
recently floated based its share-selling cam-
paign on the M.L.C.’s success; but as the
•'Wild Cat” has often pointed out, that
prosperity was rooted in the management’s
capacity to eliminate waste and firmly con-
trol out-go. Conditions to-day differ in mauy
respects from those of 20-40 years ago, but
the fact that here and there a young co. has
succeeded in avoiding the pitfalls shows that,
provided certain sound business principles
are followed, success is possible to-day, too.
An excellent illustration of the quality of
the management is afforded by the expense
ratios already quoted ; though these coyer
the years when competition has been frenzied
and extravagant, the M.L.C. has actually
reduced costs over the period by 1.2 p.c. And
the office lias written a fair proportion of
new business, too:

1926.. 10,124 3,154,993 311
On the assumption that the cost of renewals
is 7 p.c., the new business rate last year was
65.5 p.c., a figure which will take a lot
of beating.
Results of the economy are expressed
each year in a handsome form to those policy-
holders who were taken over early in the
present century when the Citizens' (as it
then was) absorbed first the M.L.A. and then
the Australian Widows’ Fund, both purely
mutual offices. At the time the Citizens’
Ordinary costs were 8.1 p.c. of total income
and 10 p.c. of premium income. The expense
rates of the mutual offices were more than
twice as great. The Citizens’ guaranteed in
each case that costs would not exceed _lO
p.c. of total income. Needless to say, policy-
holders of the two old societies have done
handsomely. Last year’s cash surplus re-
ceived by A.W.F. policies exceeded 109 p.c.,
which ineans that policy-holders are now
getting back more than they are paying in.
Trustees look after the interest of A.W.F.
and M.L.A. policy-holders and the former’s
are moved to superlatives in their annual
report. The figures are phenomenal, they
say, and add: “This year’s distributed sur-
plus, if divided as a reversionary bonus cal-
culated on the sum assured only, would equal
£4 7s. 7d. p.c. on policies of all classes, a
rate probably never exceeded, if equalled, by
any other Life office in any part of the
world.”
Actuary Miller found a total on
the M.L.C.’s own policies of £570,091, of
which he recommended that £569,834 be dis-
tributed. This will provide reversionary
bonuses for the year totalling £BOO,OOO, as
compared with the £740,000 of last year. The
valuation was made on a strictly pure-
premium basis at 3 p.c. interest. There is
extra security for policies in that conserva-
tive assumption and every fraction earned
above that rate means fatter bonuses in the
future. Actually, the return from funds is
much greater: last year it was £5 13s. lid.
p.c., compared with £5 os. Id. p.c. for 1925
and £5 ss. Id. for 1924. This solid increase
was due to the exchanging of Government
securities for others yielding a higher rate.
The improvement was won without affecting
materially tin l composition of funds: —

The M.L.C. deserves the more credit for
its brilliant figures because its disposition
of funds is so conservative. Such a gilt-
edged picture must inevitably attract busi-
ness, or make its winning easy.

Of this branch’s total funds of £2,6<56,518,
Actuary Miller estimated the net liability at
£2,608,211, leaving a surplus of £78,607. This
department has been the chief source of
profit for shareholders. Policy-holders are
guaranteed that the amount assured will be
paid; the co.’s capital backs the guarantee.
The rate of interest has been calculated at
31 p.c. over all policies. Shareholders reap
a wonderful return. Past year they got
£lBO,OOO in divs. on tile £200,000 of capital
—an increase of £lO,OOO over the previous
year. Of the amount, £30,000 came from the
Accident branch; £73,242 from Industrial
and £76,738 from Ordinary profits. Share-
holders can take up to 20 p.c. of profits
won in the Ordinary branch; last year they
took less than 13 p.c. Above everything is
obvious that by its ultra-conservative calcu-
lations, the management is primarily con-
cerning itself not with shareholder's, but
with the security of policy-holders.

No explanation was given, in the report, of
the decrease in the div. rate. It was re-
corded, however, that “up-to-date machinery
is being installed, and improvements to plant
being made, and a good deal more will be
required to cope with the present conditions
of trade.” From which it; reasonably may
he assumed that some of the existing plant
is out-of-date. Forgetting everything that
happened in the days of Queensland’s finan-
cial crash, shareholders have done very well,
all things considered. In 1915 there was a
100 p.c. gift issue, and in 1920 a distribution
of one fully-paid for every four held. Recent
figures, however, suggest that the gift-giving
may have been too liberal. Three years
ago the directors stated that there was a
surplus of over £lOO,OOO in freehold pro-
perties, machinery and plant, etc. They
did not explain how much was due to appre-
ciation of values or whether over-provision
for depreciation played a big part. Now
comes the information that, in addition to
new plant being installed, much more is
required. This suggests that the £lOO,OOO
surplus might have to be revised to-day.
The “property and plant” item at February
28 was down at £407,570. which does not
appear to be a conservative estimate, and
property values in Brisbane are at high
levels. It may he, of course, that a good-
sized wad is hidden : but the market appears
to have definite doubts. At best it considers
that the internal strength is not likely to
prove much in expess of the contingencies
which have to be allowed for. A year ago.
despite the 8 p.c. div., there were sellers
of the £1 shares at 18s. 44d. and there were
sales recently at 17s. 3d.
An increase of £34,371 in the chief item
suggests solid additions to plant and proper-
ties over and above allowances for repairs,
renewals and obsolescence. Whether the
provision was sufficient and whether enough
was taken out of profits to meet contin-
gencies is known only to those inside. The
figures don't suggest that the co. has been
overdoing it. The board declared its inten-
tions some time ago of making further pro-
perty purchases—necessary in the case of
brewing companies if they are to consolidate
their position in the teeth of very active
competition. But apart from the construc-
tion of a new hotel to replace the old Globe
in Adelaide-street during the 1926 term,
no outstanding purchases are mentioned.
Prom this aspect at least there was definite
retrogression:—

Liabilities* are very heavy. No indication
is given as to their composition, all creditor
items being lumped. A glance at. the earlier
figures show's how 7 rapid has been the drain
on liquids since 1922. Moreover, visible
reserves at February 28 wore weaker than
at the 1923 balance. The chief points are:
llow is this co. standing up against
strengthened opposition? And has the co. much
undisclosed reserves? Not only do the figures
fail to suggest hidden assets, but the reduc-
tion in the div. rate implies that the man-
agement considers that it needs all it can
hang on to.

The first quinquennial investigation w T as
made last year by consulting-actuary
Bremner and disclosed the net liability under
the co.’s policies as at December 31, 1925, to
be £99,924. The board met the problem in a
Micawberish fashion. They adjusted the
purchase accounts of the Industrial depart-
ments of the Life Insurance Co. of Australia
and the Co-operative Assurance Co. so that
the amount standing in the balance-sheet
represented “not only cash consideration paid
for same, but the amount of actuarial liabili-
ties taken over.” A round £48,000 came from
tin' operation. However, that was not suf-
ficient, so £32,484 was transferred from
establishment account. The consequence is
that the office was enabled to parade a
robust-looking life-insurance fund of £118,163,
while the hot air expanded to £121,287. It
looks quite good: the life-insurance fund
thus built; up covers the liabilities under
policies. But glance at the balance-sheet

Even, tlie £92,592 which figures in the table as
net assets weakens on examination. One-third
of it, for instance, is represented by “shares
in other cos.” These shares wore received in
1925 from the Commonwealth Traders’ Insur-
ance as consideration for the Commonwealth-
General’s fire, marine and other general
business. But the Commonwealth Traders
at its last balance had almost 40 p.c. of its
capital unrepresented by tangibles; and the
amount it held in reserve was less than half
the usual provision for unexpired risks. There
is this to be said, however, the Common-
wealth Traders appears to have prospects.

♦Excess outgoings.
Much more, however, needs to be done. The
office Ims not yet succeeded in solving the pro-
blem of getting good business and holding what
is written. Far too many policies are thrown
in at the end of each year. Here is this
minor tragedy in six acts: —
Life Business Written.
Ordinary Annual
Policies. Assuring. Premiums.
1921.. .. 896 £224,688 £9,981
1922.. .. 1027 303,008 14,320
1923.. .. 1128 324,463 14,233

1925.. .. 730 196,527 7,749
1926.. .. 681 203,397 7,369
5242 £1,436,285 £61,152
Last year's net premium income in the
Ordinary department was only £22,251, of
which renewals represented £15,428. As
renewals in 1925 amounted to £15.792 and
policies producing annual income of £7748
were written, possible renewals last year
were £23,511 less a trifle representing
matured policies. Instead, the amount was
less than that of the previous year. It is
plain that there is a shocking waste here.
More particularly do these figures appear in
a bad light when it is realised that each £lOO
of business cost the office £l5O or more to
write.
Industrial is looking up. but it still lias a
long way to go before it fulfils the expecta-
tions of the late Thos. Foster, the founder of
the co. Foster contended that Industrial
was a good profit-winner if done in big licks,
and the two businesses which last year came
in so handy for writing-up purposes were
purchased in accordance with that belief.
Altogether the directors extract much more
out of the picture than is obvious when they
point out “with pleasure” the co.’s “con-
tinued progress.” Costs certainly were re-
duced a couple of points and the year’s addi-
tions to funds placed chiefly in public securi-
ties, but the management is faced with the
necessity of writing a larger volume of busi-
ness at much lower cost if it is to get on to
a sound basis. And last year’s figures do not
inspire confidence that it will break any
records in accomplishing the task. Not only
are the intangibles of forbidding dimensions,
but the process of their reduction appears
likely to be long drawn out. Bonuses can be
classed for the time being as a pipe dream:
policy-holders cannot build very high on that.
Shareholders, of course, hardly enter into
consideration. There arc 74.318 Ist prefs.
and 74,963 2nd prefs. each 1()s. paid to 65..
and their divs. are accumulating. Holders of
the 150,000 10s. ordinaries 1 also paid to 65.)
need take no interest until the prefs. have
been attended to; which means that they are
free to concentrate their attention on other
matters for a long time.

Earnings were affected by the industrial
troubles in England; but as values of wool,
frozen meat, etc., are either well or fairly
well maintained, shareholders still received
124 p.c. The board doubtless was influenced
in distributing more than it earned by the.
reports to hand when the finishing touches
were being put to the accounts in February
(headquarters are in London) plus the pro-
mise in the outlook at that date. Considering
the fat reserves—well in excess of paid capi-
tal-shareholders are not getting anything
excessive out of the business; and when it is
further realised that the co. has the use of
£798,780 of cheap debentures, the earnings
seem positively modest. These figures afford
a partial explanation :

I have never before recorded

I have played for the AMPICO
because of its absolute faithfulness.
PONDER this declaration of the great Russian pianist! Better still, consider the
deep import of the whole of his letter which is printed above! This statement
of Rachmaninoff means definitely that he was unwilling to record "for any reproduc-
ing piano.” He was unwilling that his work should be judged by any repetition
which but thinly shadowed forth the magnificence of the original performance. Then
he met the Ampico and ? in gratitude, he eagerly seized so rare and wonderful an
opportunity for the perpetuation of his playing.
In effect he says of the Ampico: "This is Rachmaninoff. Whatever I can do, it will
repeat. Whatever I have done, it will do—for ever!” There was never a finer
tribute. It comes from a great master, jealous of his reputation and keenly anxious
that contemporaries and those to come, shall know him as he really is !
Testimony equally definite and convincing, has been written by other world-famous artists who perform ex-
clusively for the Ampico—notably Moisiewitsch, Ornstein, Leyitzki, Godowsky, Strauss, Schnitzer, D’lndy and others.
BEALE -AMPICO
The Ampico is associated only with the world’s greatest pianos—instruments possessing the rich tone, great volume and
fine subtlety of expression vital to Ampico re-enactments. In Australia, the BE ALE-AMPICO is the worthy repre-
sentative of this group of celebrities.
The IVorld’s Music at your Command
The music of all the world is yours to command through
the Beale-Ampico: This wonderful instrument will play
for you sonatas, nocturnes, operatic selections, serenades
and fantasies; simple songs and ballads, hymns, marches,
dance music, jazz. The most modern selections beside
the musical treasures of generations.
You must hear the Beale-Ampico —
for without hearing it you cannot appreciate the marvel of its performance.
We invite you to hear the Beale-Ampico at our George Street Showrooms,
Sydney, or any of our Branch addresses.

Almost deserted Westonia (W.A.) has
hopes of a revival. Someone recently struck
a fine and coarse gold-bearing lode in a show
about three miles west of the old Edna May
group. A Perth syndicate, headed by Claude
de Bernales, .T. McDermott and Rose Grant,
is reported to have secured a 12-months’
option owr the star block. A Bulletin
man who was on the field a couple of years
ago found that the remnants of a once-
prosperous centre were a few dilapidated
structures, rusting plant and a handful of
depressed people. Since then the inhabitants,
assisted by Government grants and a little
outside capital, have bucked up a bit and
a little gold has been won from shows
which were thought to have been worked
out.
Wiluna Gold Mines, Ltd., whose shares
are all held by Wiluna Gold Corporation,
London, held a quiet little meeting in Kal-
goorlie the other day. Chairman Claude de
Bernales announced that approximately
£35,000 had been spent on development dur-
ing the past year and that by the end of
June ore reserves would probably exceed
750,000 tons of 395. 4d. ore. When cheering
had ceased he added that the present work-
ings were confined to a small portion of the
property and that it was not unreasonable
to expect that the payable ore bodies would
extend right through the co.’s holding a dis-
tance of two miles. Something was also
said about the enormous size of the Wiluna
lodes and about the experimental plant which
was recently installed at a cost of £20,000
to determine the best method of ore treat-
ment.
* *
With Royal Commissioner Kingsley
Thomas’s strong recommendations in mind,
Premier Collier (W.A.) hinted the other
day that Kalgoorlie and Boulder cos. needn’t
expect much financial assistance from either
his or the Federal Government unless they
reorganise and amalgamate. The trouble is
they won’t co-operate. Oroya Links ex-
pressed its willingness some time ago to
make one of a group, but was cold-
shouldered; and only last month a similar
proposal put before the Gt. Boulder and
Lake View by the Golden Horseshoe was
shelved by those cos. As the passive resisters
are determined to do nothing, it looks as if
the State and Commonwealth are expected
to find all the money required to give the
field a leg-up—and keep everybody in his job.
* * * *
Some London shareholders are again clam-
oring for the voluntary liquidation of Oroya
Links (W.A.). They allege that the co.’s
present operations at Kalgoorlie are yielding
little profit and that if continued there is
a danger of loss. In any ease, as the pros-
pect of further divs. is remote, and as nearly
half the income from investments is swal-
lowed up in London exes., these dissatisfied
shareholders consider that the co. should
wind up and distribute its assets. At present
they are worth at least 2s. 9d. per share,
or nearly double the market price.
* * * *
North White Feather (W.A.) has issued
another statement regarding its prospects.
This time the paralysed state of the market
is said to be due to “the merits of the
eo.’s property not being generally known”:
it is affirmed that, although speculative, the
shares have attractive possibilities. The
Bulletin doesn't know about the shares,
but is convinced that the mine is no good.
The Victory dredging area, llelenvale,
Cooktown (N.Q.). held by the Tasmanian
Tin Co., has been bored to some extent, but
work has been dropped for the present on
the plea that boring tests are unreliable.
The co. announces that it will test by shafts
in the course of the next month or two.

Metropolitan Tin Mines is the latest Mel-
bourne flotation to have a crack at N.
Queensland tin. Capital is £lO,OOO in 100,000
shares of 2s. each, and a property already
being worked, and within a couple of miles
of the Sardine, has been taken over. Twenty-
five thousand f.p. shares have been issued,
12,500 being part of the price paid to the
owner, W. S. Simpson; 12,500 go to the
middleman. Simpson has also been paid
£5OO in cash, a further £l5OO to be handed
to him by the middle of May. The lease
was worked 20 years ago, with good results;
two shafts are down 100 ft. and 50ft., with
a connecting tunnel.

The “mother lode” at Ravenswood (N.Q.),
victim of many assaults, more or less un-
satisfactory. is again being attacked. Open-
cut and hand-picking are being used; the
accessories are stamps plus Wilfleys. A 20ft.
face is being worked and clean granite goes
west while the remaining 60 p.c. faces the
mill. One hundred and sixty tons ;just
crushed gave 91 oz. retorted gold; allowing
discards, this works out at about 20s. per
ton. The margin is narrow for small-scale
operations. This big body of crushed and
impregnated granite might make a little
Hollinger with well-directed enterprise and
cheap hydro-electric power. These two fac-
tors made the Hollinger (Canada) on simi
lar grade ore—four to five pennyweights.
The old Shrimp, Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.).
which has been taken lip in claims since the
Towers co. threw in the sponge, has pro-
duced sizable parcels of tin and there are
undoubtedly some rich gash veins knocking
about the low-grade matrix. St. Smith, who
visioned it, of course,, as a large low-grade
proposition, o.k.’d the old co., but it went
under. Were methods or diagnosis astray?
A crushing of 87 tons from the bottom of
the open cut produced seven tons of con-
centrates worth £l2 a ton, but many tons
were discarded in picking. At No. 1 shaft
1.2 tons of 10 p.c. ore have been raised
and there is more in sight.

Sardine, that excellent little N.Q. tin-lode
show which is run by a Charters Towers co.,
has declared its 25th dividend —threepence,
payable on May 26. The show lias distributed
in all £58,000. most of it to two Towers
brokers and mine-bacKers.

At the general meeting of the Flagstone
(N.S.W.) C. It. MacKenzie said there was
no pay ore at present showing, the lenses
having cut out V-shaped. Then angry
shareholders read extracts from MaeKenzie’s
glowing reports during the April-Octob r
period of last year. The meeting was told
that 2046 tons have been crushed in all for
36 tons oxide, about If p.c. stuff —nothing
like the prospectus and managerial estimates.
The more shareholders probed the financial
side the worse they found it. Strong com-
plaints were voiced that the directors, with-
out consulting holders of scrip, had mort-
gaged the assets for £2OOO to Colin Caird, a
director who also was the vendor, with L.
M. Collins, of the original lease. The mine
and plant, and development thereof, are in
the books at £49,614, but it is obvious that
a crushing plant valued at £9434 stuck away
on a rough hillside 23 miles from a railway
is worth a mere trifle unless in commission
on payable ore. Caird offered to throw in
his debenture over the lot to the first taker,
thus giving a cue to his opinion of the out-
look. A humorous turn was a lament that
the 4500 contribs. are not responding well
to the call campaign of the board.

A German brown-coal engineer named
Klitzing has been appointed consulting
engineer to the Electricity Commissioners at
Yallourn (Vic.), at £l5OO a year. On his
advice, the Commissioners have bought
£30,000 worth of modern briquetting mach-
inery in Germany, including an overburden
dredger. All this should have been done at
the outset of the enterprise, because the
local engineers in charge of the brown-coal
department knew nothing of modern practice
in making briquettes.

day's trip of the Edie Creek field. Three
trips a day are to be made, but even then, as
the machine carries only 1001 b. of cargo on
each trip, it means less than a ton a week.
Still, even that is a vast improvement on
the week-long trip on foot from Salamoa, to
say nothing of the expensive native labor
released for work on the claims. The
successful establishment of the service
.should lead to other concerns coming into
the game—at least one has despatched a
machine to begin a carrying business pure
and simple—and improved conditions should
result in the held being genuinely tested.
The first week of the service was an un-
qualified success. Fourteen trips were made,
taking only 50 minutes each —the journey on
foot takes five days. Fifteen passengers were
carried, and 28501 b. of freight. The high
“climb” has presented no difficulties.
The latest offshoot of Tanah Biji is Seren-
dah South, nominal capital £165,000, of
which £lOO,OOO is contributory and £65.000
issued as fully paid ; of the latter lot Tanah
Biji takes 50,000 and gets £5OOO in cash.
The area is reckoned to contain 20,000,000
c. yds., estimated by Penman to 5 7 ield 11b.
per yard. With tin at £250, London, he
figures on a net profit of £BO,OOO p.a. Tanah
Biji is accumulating assets; it now has
25,000 Jelapangs, 30,000 Serendahs and
50,000 Serendali Souths —in all, 105,000
shares, besides cash balances. Tanah Biji
makes it a rule to offer all shares in its sub-
sidiaries to its own shareholders, with, so
far, very pleasing results.

Burma Malay holding co. is issuing an-
other 10,000 shares at £1 premium in the
ratio of one for three. The need of the new
capital is explained in a circular which
remarks that new areas cost money even
prior to the flotation process. After the new
issue has been completed the co. will be re-
constructed in 150,000 £1 shares, of which
present holders will get 100,000 on a basis of
2A for 1, and 50,000 will be held in reserve. A
new co. to acquire the Renong areas will
soon be on the stocks.
Thabawleik (Burma) has struck the water
shortage forecasted in its last annual report,
and will have a thin April. A. W. Freeman,
who is over there, cables hopefully that
things will be o.k. after the weather breaks,
and forecasts increased yardages and output.
The ground, however, has proved stiffer than
the prospectus admitted, and yields have not
stood up to the 21b. anticipated, although
240 z. is comfortable with tin about £3OO.
But it doesn’t justify the 665. peak price for
scrip, and even the' present 575. 6d. seems
high.
Commonwealth Malaya Tin, in whose in-
terests Randolph Bedford recently went
north to confer with E. T. J. Rodda, the
co.’s field engineer, seems to have a good
thing in the Renong option. At the date
of the Wild Cat’s latest advices, 200
acres of 40ft. ground had been bored and
the 12oz. average had been well maintained.
There were 800 acres still to be tested. The
co. holds, in addition, two prospecting
licenses over 800 acres in Perak, an area
in Burmah and exclusive prospecting licenses
in Siam over 7200 acres at Kapur and on
the Pak Chan River. The. most immediate
attention is, however, to be given, after the
Renong boring has been completed, to an
option over 1200 acres in new country in
Siam, comparatively shallow (20 to 24 feet),
but said to be I Jlb. ground.

Brisbane has now been bitten by the
Bulolo bug, and a syndicate has been formed
to shovel up the nuggets. Styled the N.G.
Gold arid Rare Metals Prospecting Co., its
objective is the penetration of the compara-
tively untouched country lying behind the
Edie. H. G. Taylor leads the expedition,
which will be joined on arrival by .T. F.
Pierce, who has had some years of N.G.
experience, and is already collecting native
labor for the party. The capital has been
subscribed by Brisbane business men.

Oriental Tin’s latest report discloses no
luck so far. One option has been aban-
doned and in another scout bores show a
very shallow deposit and patchy tin. Three
other blocks have been partly tested. So
far results have not been encouraging. The
ex-Queensland Government Geologist St.
Smith is in charge.

Takuapa’s directorate having let April pass
without making a noise like a dividend, no
one fancied the scrip last week, though shares
stood at a premium of 17s. There are cash
reserves of nearly £25,000, but the co. needs
the money. The right-up-to-date bucket
dredge is expensive, and it is reported that,
instead of being ready to run in October, a
start with this second machine will not be
made until 1925. One group is reported to
have oversold Takuapas heavily, which may
or may not be taken as indicating a coming
drop.
Twyford Malayan Tin has picked up 160
acres at Mukin (F.M.S.) and is floating the
Gunong Tin Dredging Co. to work it. The
vendor co. takes 40,000 55., shares and
£13,167 in cash, paying £8177 to the owners
of the area.
Lampeh Tin is a Siamese venture with h.q.
•in Melbourne. The annual report has a lot
to say about the new bucket dredge which,
delayed by the wet season, it is hoped to
have running by tlie end of July—flip co.
lias been operating a suction cutter dredge
to date. Drcdgeable property has been in-
creased by 85 acres, giving a total of three
million c.y., with values reckoned at bo/.
Six shillings lias been called up on each shaiv
since last April. Working exes., including
brokerage, got ahead of income by £971 b.
Paid-up capital on Sept. 30 was £124,250.
Assets: Mine, £01,604: suction dredge.
£.‘>1.548 ; bucket dredge, £8713; sundry plant,
buildings, roads, £9768; debtors, £628; and
cash, £4473. The figures suggest that the
co. has a good deal of leeway to make up.
and on 9oz. values at that.
Australia hears little of South African
tin production-—the last available figures
place it at less than this country’s, and we
stand eighth on the list of the world’s pro-
ducers. But the last: annual report of Leeuw-
poort Tin Mines, a North Transvaal con-
cern, indicates that there is at least one
useful lode show there. For the year 1925.
the co. crushed 65,545 tons for 772 tons con-
centrates averaging 60.34 p.e. metallic tin.
and net profit was £25,273. The last avail-
able quarterly report, to June, 1926, shows
176 tons of concentrates averaging 66 p.e.,
and a £5510 profit, taking tin at £282 per
ton. Capital is £200,000, and as the pro-
perty is in the Waterberg district, which is
thickly inhabited by natives, labor costs are
probably low enough to account for the
good net returns.

OBJECTS.
The objects of the Company are, inter alia, to: —
(1) Acquire as a going concern the 76-year old business of Messrs. Gehrig and Co., Wine
and Spirit Merchants, and certain assets thereof as hereunder specified;
(2) ) Acouire as a going concern the business of the N.S.W. Wine and Spirit Co. and
certain assets as specified hereunder ;
(3) Amalgamate these businesses and, aided by obvious economies made possible by such
merger and by vigorous management, conserve, develop, and extend the existing and
open up new avenues of trade and utilise to the full the value of the good name
and the dormant possibilities properly attributable to a long and favorably known
trade establishment, especially in regard to the wholesale business. ...
(4) Bet a standard, new to Australia, but successful in other parts of the world, in
respect to Wine Saloons.
ASSETS TO BE ACQUIRED.

It is considered that the whole of the assets have been acquired on the basis of very
conservative valuations. In particular, the .valuations of Wine Licenses and Leases were
made a few months ago—quite independently—by the following trade authorities at the
following figures (based on the 1,925 turnover) :

C. P. Ellsmore " . . 16TOO
Arthur L. Garvey • • ■ • 17,5U0
The average of the foregoing is £15,750. so that the Company appears to have made
an excellent bargain in this respect, seeing that the Leases have been purchased for
£9,000, which is £6,750 less than the average valuation set out above. . ,
In respect to Stocks, the understanding is that the new Company may select such
Wines as it requires from the Stocks now in the cellar—that is, Wines of all grades and
qualities. Under this arrangement the Company will be in a most enviable position.
That the Goodwill is substantial is reflected by the fact that the firm has an uiibroken
record of 76 years’ clean and successful trading. Gehrig s Wines are a household name
throughout the State and have been awarded many medals and other distinctions at the

Dear Sir, G e H r IG &CO and THE N.S.W. WINE & SPIRIT CO.
As vou are aware, we have examined the audited accounts of the N.S.W. Wine and Spirit Co.
and the reports of Messrs. Norton and Faviell, and have also spent some time in going through the
The latter proved to be very incomplete, but from the turnover and other material facts adduced
we were able to make an approximate summary of the turnover effected, the gross profits earned thereon
and also arrive at the expenditure incidental thereto. _ „, c ,, _ ,
The N.S.W. Wine & Spirit Co. formed part of the Estate of J. A. O Shea, deceased
On the basis of the 1926 figures, allowing only for exception of the additional trade of the two
shops acquired in 1927 and for the economies which are reasonably anticipated and should follow the
amalgamation, it appears probable that the gross profits of the two concerns to be merged should

Except in regard to the trade of the two new shops referred to, the foregoing has been calculated
from data supplied and on the basis of the existing turnover (1926) and takes no other of
profits consequent upon possible expansion—nor, of course, of any additional expenses which to . >

1 We have examined with* care all the estimates as to economies to be effected by the management and
control of the two concerns being under one roof and a unified personnel, and are o the opinion that
same are feasible and proper and that the estimates of profits are calculated on a reasonable basis.
Our previous detailed reports to you are relevant, but too .lengthy far publication.

The foregoing estimates have been carefully calculated, and it will be noted that they are, with

Provisional Directors have no doubt that the management will be so vitalised that the will
considerably increased, and the Profits accordingly improved—beyond the estimate to a veiy substantial
extent The Consulting Accountants very properly did not and could not take into consideration anv
indefinite amelioration of conditions. The Directors feel too that the Accountants estimates are ultra-
conservative and confidently anticipate that the profits will be enhanced from the start and elv

MANAGEMENT.
Two of the Vendors—Charles Frederick Gehrig and Henry Jacob Gehrig—who have had a lifetime’s
experience in the Wine trade, and who have for so miny years been continuously associated With theJius
ness to be acquired by the Company, will take an active part in the management of the Company Mi.
Henrv as a Director and Mr. Charles in a consultative capacity in respect to the buying and blending In
addition, the sendees of a competent Commercial M inager (one is m view) and the appointment
aggressive outdoor representatives will remedy defects in the old organisations.
DIRECTORS.
In Messrs. Westphal and Gehrig the Board will have two men who are undmfb tedly amongst the very
best iudsres of Wine in the Commonwealth. Mr. Kelly’s former experience in the tunle will also be
of great, assistance, whilst Messrs. Davis and Cooper will bring to the Board considerable commercial
knowledge and experience. ... , • n
The Board is well balanced from both the technical and commercial aspects.
WINE TRADE.
The Wine Industry in Australia is definitely increasing, and yydth the large number of Soldier-settlers
engaged in it and improved methods of distribution, the increase should be still more marked in
One of the most potent reasons that has hampered the progress of the Wine u »*) the
has been the indifferent character of many of the saloons. This phase of the mattei will have tn
particular attention of the Board. Already, in both Sydney and Melbourne, u has been provedI that theie
is a demand for retail establishments conducted on the most approved lines, and it is believed that tilt
public will respond generously to added facilities of this nature. Other methods are also open to
the use of Wines in lieu of Spirits or Beer in Hotels. The Government has assisted the Sold er-settleis
growing Grapes for Wine-making purposes and must necessarily aid in creating a greater demand toi then
pi oduets. wholesale trade can, and should, be further developed, and there is a big field in this direction.
SPECIAL ATTRACTIONS OF THE INVESTMENT.
1 This is not a new business with speculative chances of success; it is the continuation of a
successful 76-vear-old business, merged with another business of long standing. The profits on the present
business are sufficient to pay the Shareholders a dividend of 10 p.c., and leave a sufficient margin fo
reputation Q{ the old concerns is excellent and the quality of their products is reflected by
the awards made to them in open competition. These awards include the Champion Gold Medal o
Sherry which was awarded to Messrs. Gehrig & Co., for the past eight years in succession—a feat un-
precedented in The history of the trade. The N.S.W. Wine & Spirit Co. too have earned numerous
awards for their Wines. The quality of the Wines blended by both the firms has always been acknow-
ledged bv the trade as pre-eminent, but the methods of distribution have been faulty.
B 3 xhe field is wide and expanding. The number of competitors for the increasing trade is inclined to
o-et less, thus offering greater opportunities to those engaged in the wholesale trade.
4 The Shares offered are preferential in every way to the small parcel the tenders aie to receive.
In this connection, were it not for the technicalities that pertain to the carrying on of a_ business owned
bv an Estate, the Vendors would have been prepared to take a larger number of Shares in lieu of casW.
No o-reater evidence of the bona fides and faith in the venture could have been supplied by the Vendors.
a 5 It is only because family interests were becoming, in the case of Gehrig & Co. too involved for
the convenient conduct of the business, and for the desirability of a deceased estate quitting the field of
trading operations in the case of the N.S.W. Wine Sr Spirit Co., that the opportunity became available to
acquire these two businesses as going concerns and with practically no pavment foi Goodwill. me
occasion was unique and is not likely to occur again.

The Commonwealth Government got tlie
services of two leading artists, after all, to
immortalise the doings at Canberra. 11. 8.
Power, the Adelaidean who paints horses in
such a manner that neither a vet. nor an
art critic can cavil, is to do the exterior busi-
ness, presumably so that he may assuage
the dulness of the task by dwelling lovingly
over the equines in the royal jinker. He
has already been detected on racecourses,
stalking Albert, with a sketch-book in liis
hand. Mclnnes, accomplished portrayer of
social headlights with a Duco finish and
permanent pre-emptor of the Archibald prize,
is to do the interior decorations. liis only
previous experience of group painting was a
Gallipoli incident. Both declare that nothing
will induce them to subordinate artistic prin-
ciples to the demands of official snobbery.

R. A. CROUCH,
the new president
of the Vie. Labor
party.
The £4OOO a year paid to E. C. Riddle as
Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is
just 100 times the screw he started on as a
junior in the Narrabri (N.S.W.) branch of
the ’Asia, close on 40 years ago. His first
big step was taken when he became Perth
manager, the job from which Denison Miller
lifted him when he chose his staff. 11.
T. Armitage, who steps into the job of
Deputy-Govelnor, also came from Perth,
where he was accountant for the Wales.
W. TI. Edgar, M.L.C.. is nibbling at the
Vie. Agent-Generalship. If he gets it R. G.
Menzies, a top-notcher at the Bar, may suc-
ceed him in the ITppah Chambah as member
for East Yarrn Province. Parliament can
do with another lawyer; it lias only five in
Ihe two Houses.
Now that Madden is to succeed Beatty at
the Admiralty. Harper’s report on Jutland
may see the light of day. Captain Harper,
offspring of a well-known Maoriland family,
was not at Jutland, but under Admiralty
instructions he drew up a report on the action
based on all the facts available. Beatty
pigeon-holed it. Madden, who is Jellicoe's
brother-in-law and was his right-hand man
in the Grand Fleet, has kept out of the
controversy, but he won’t be averse to letting
the world know the truth.
Queensland Uni’s new Chancellor, James
William Blair, C.J., owes nothing to univer-
sities himself. He won to Bar and Bench
from a Government-school scholarship be-
ginning. and took his first wig at the local
law examinations, after reading in chambers.
As a politician, Blair bulked large, rising to
Cabinet rank in several administrate:** Hr
lias travelled some way since, as a good-
looking bachelor barrister, lie bad the heart
and vote of every female in his then invio-
lable seat of Ipswieli. It was his custom to
issue a heart-shaped card with a cord attach-
ment for hanging on buttons. On one side
the curly-haired candidate smiled at his sup-
porters; on the other was the touching
appeal: “Vote for Jimmy.” But eventually
there arose a majority that demanded re 1
Labor sentiments from candidates, and the
(LI.-to-be returned to the more lucrative field
of Costs.
The old steamer Emma Byers, which took
the Yorks up the Tweed River, was built
about 43 years ago at Irvington, the navi-
gable head of the Richmond River, for “Iron-
bark” Bob Byers, timber-getter, auctioneer,
M. and other things. She was named
after the owner’s daughter, then little, more
than a toddler, and now carrying on the
auctioneering business in Casino, the only
woman who regularly wields the gavel in
N. \V. Some years ago the family fortunes
ebbed, but Emma took hold and built them
up again by buying and selling- pigs.
Auckland Uni. is to have a new prof of

lad who came early to M.L. and worked his
way back to Cambridge. He comes with a
strong recommendation from John Maynard
Keynes. The new prof., who got his ideas
in liiiigland, thinks there isn’t much hope
for manufacturers in M.L.; he’ll get his eyes
opened when he finds out what has been done
already, lie says his mission in life is to
teach the cookies economics.
Cap’n Bob Reid, lately gone aloft at 82.
knew the Speck’s corrugated coastline better
than most. He sailed from Scotland to Tas-
mania at 10, and was a shipowner, with a
master's ticket,. at an early age, trading on
the west coast of Tassie. Three shipwrecks,
one of which marooned him for two months
on a rocky islet, where he lived on sea. birds,
were part of his seafaring. A spell ashore,
cattle-raising on King Island, didn’t satisfy
him for long. He made a bit of money as
one of the Mount Bisclioff syndicate, and he,
went back to shipowning.
There is another dean at St. Mary’s
Cathedral. Sydney, John Ilalpin having
pushed off to a parish. Patrick Crowley,
who gets the vacant post, came from All
Hallows, and has found things rnbber-tyred
for him in Australia. He had a spell as
bursar in the Cardinal’s college, was chap-
lain to Archbishop Kelly, and then inspector
of schools in the archdiocese. He goes to
the cathedral fresh from a year’s jaunt round
the world,
Anglicans in Australia have been going
north for their bishops. The recently-vacant
sees of Riverina and Willoelira were both
filled by bush brothers from N.Q/, and other
names from the same Stale are on the list
from which Australian Synods draw. Now
the R.C.’s have taken Father Bach out of
Thursday Island to hold a pastoral crook
over the Gilbert Islands. Nauru, where the
phosphate comes from, will be in tlie new
episcopate.
Premier John Allan, who is a farmer, is
not tile first non-lawyer in Vie. to take the
Attorney-Generalship. When the Elmslie
Labor Government was in office (but not in
power) for 13 days in December, 1913. W.
■T. Evans, M.L.C., who drove a locomotive
before he got to the plush seats, was Law
Minister. Allan is holding the job tempo-
rarily, as something had to be done upon the
resignation of Eggleston,. 19 days after his
defeat for St. Kilda. Lawson and Snowball,
AI’s.L.A., and Cohen. M.L.C., the only non-
Labor lawyers in Parliament, were “unavail-
able.”
As a sign that the heads of the British
motor trade are realising that the Aus-
tralian market is worth cultivating, \V. E.
Bootes, king-pin of Bootes Ltd., a very old-
established firm of exporters, who attend to
overseas sales of the Daimler and some less
swanky English makes, has come to the
Commonwealth. Rootes already know a good
deal about Australian conditions and tastes,
and the head of the firm has now arrived in
Sydney to see things for himself and estab-
lish a branch. Bananaland and Maoriland
will he looked at carefully before he goes
back to Blighty.
The biggest- one-ship command in the
British Navy goes to a Victorian, Com-
mander A. L. St. G. Lyster, D. 5.0.. son of
a Colac doctor; he is to he “owner” of the
Nelson, the world’s most tremendous floating
weapon, just, launched. Lyster’s last, glimpse
of Australia was from the Renown when
Edward P. was passenger.
A. .1. Draper, who failed to gel elected
Mayor of Cairns (N.Q.) lately, has been
Mayor nine times, and has served the district
well in other capacities. He started the ex-
port business in bananas, and was a pioneer
in attempts to grow coffee, tobacco, _ pines
and other semi-tropical things. Most of them
failed, but he made up for the failures by
his tenacity in fighting the cause of sugar.
He was the first chairman of the Mulgrave
Central Mill, and has remained at the helm
for 30 years. Draper started in Cairns as
manager of the local' branch of' the Bank of
Australasia : these days lie describes himsclt
as an auctioneer.
SENATOR T. W. -GLASGOW, K.C.R.,
the new Federal Miniftier of Defence.
4 rank Tate. Vic. Director of Education,
is off to London to attend the Imperial Edu-
cation Conference. While in Fogtown he will
celebrate his golden jubilee as an officer of
the Education Department. Before bis de-
parture, M. Turck, the French Consul,
handed Tate the insignia of the Legion of
honor conferred on him recently. He is also
a C.M.G. and an 1.5.0.
T. M, Hall, who has gone west in Bris-
bane, aged 68, founded a trade protection
concern in Sydney and transplanted it in
Brisbane in the late ’eighties. He was a fast
sprinter in his N.S.W. days, and played
cricket in Queensland, where lie was prized
by liis club as a slow bowler. An alderman
of Brisbane. M.L.C.. and holder of a dozen
other public offices, the kindly old chap knew
everyone “of any note,” as he used to say,
in Queensland.
The skipper and mate of the London
Missionary Society’s steamer John Williams,
on which a member of the black crew ran
amok recently, bear famous names. They
are Captain Kettle and Tom Bowling.
There arc now 11 Diggers in Vic. Assem-
bly—Argyle, Bourchier, Morley, Gray, Kent-
llughes, Knox, Slater, Hughes, Webber. Pol-
lard and Forrest. And Bailey served in the
South African War. Gray talks of forming
a Soldiers’ party, but he won’t succeed.
John Crawford, dead at Gympie (Q.) at
81, could claim to be a dyed-in-the-wool
digger of the old type. Out from Belfast
in 1862, he deserted tin-scratching at Stan-
thorpe to join the Gympie rush. When
Gympie palled, lie trekked 700 miles over-
land to the just-discovered Palmer field,
behind Cooktown. The Westralian fields
then called him; he chased the elusive “lucky
strike” to Leonora. Then he decided to call
it a day and returned to Queensland. In
the intervals he managed to rear a family of
eight.
Wood Jones will be succeeded in the Elder
chair of anatomy at Adelaide Uni. by Dr.
H. H. Woollard, a good Australian. Wool-
lard graduated in medicine at Melbourne,
topping the honors list of 1910, and got bis
M.D. two years later. He joined up with
the A.A.M.C. in 1914 and the Armistice
found him a lieutenant-colonel. Except for
a year at the Johns Hopkins Medical School
as Rockefeller Research Fellow, he has spent
the last seven years under Elliot Smith a
University College, London. He won tlm
Symington prize for the best piece of original
work published in-the Journal of Axvmuv
in the last two years.
George Elliot, one of Maoriland’s dele-
gates to the Economic Conference, is a Scot
—he was born at Jedburgh and married a
meemster’s daughter—and his climb has been
a pretty arduous affair. Now- lie’s at the
summit: a belted knight, chairman of the
Bank of Now Zealand and director of numer-
ous companies. Jimmy Eight, who is to
be Elliot’s cobber at Geneva, a Maorilandcr
by birth, is of the dreamy, intellectual type
though a great worker. He got the first
D.Litt. handed out by Maoriland Uni., and
has amassed a lot of other letters. Political
economy, commerce, and constitutional his-
tory are his meat, and he is Dean of the
Faculty of Law and Commerce at Canter-
bury Coll. Hi' plays the fiddle when his
soul needs soothing.
'Pom O’Callaghan, former Vie. Chief Com-
missioner of Police, who has had an .82ml
birthday, prides himself most on spotting
“Velvet Ned.” Ned, who was clever with
keys, served 10 years in irons in Wostraliu
for his part in the great Cornlnll robberies,
lie then came to Vic. and got away with
£7OO worth of valuables in Collingwood.
As a rule Ned wore long whiskers ami a
moustache, and was a bit of a dandy. When
(>’Ca!laghan was on the gentleman’s trail in
Collingwood, lie noticed a man in moleskins,
with a wide-awake hat, short moustache, m>
whiskers —and a drag in his legs. That was
the end of “Velvet Ned.”
An ex-Digger named Trice, who runs a
tobacco kiosk in Sydney, is not the man he
was before the war, but still cracks hearty.
His legs were cut off too close to his body
for artificial limbs to be of any use. and one
of his eyes was a war victim. Though hr
is now- only about 3ft. high, he has laid
down cement paths at his home and is a
great hand with hammer and saw. He used
to use the trams to get to his kiosk, until
the German Verge Trust gave him a motor-
ear, the control arrangements of which had
to be made to suit a man who couldn't
use pedals. Business isn't as good as it
might be, but Trice keeps a cheerful smile
and believes that the best is yet to come.
E. E. Bradbury, who paid £6BO for a West-
ralian stamp early in March, has more than
a nodding acquaintance with the Common-
wealth, to which he paid a dawdling visit
some years ago. The stamp is an old four-
penny blue in which the central figure of the
swan is printed upside down. There is a
good specimen in the Sydney Museum. Brad-
bury is publisher and part-proprietor of
Pi xeit. He is a nephew of the William
Agnew who was so esteemed as an art con-
noisseur that a wink or a nod from him
could almost turn a Vandyek into a Holbein.
The Bulletin’s “Oldest Inhabitant" cele-
brates his 87th birthday and his 70th year
in Australia on Monday.
John Douglas Ritchie, who has seen more
of the farm holdings of Maoriland than any
soul living—he's been looking at them for
36 years-—was retired on superannuation the
other day at 74.
That’s a bit of an
achievement in it-
self, since most,
civil servants have
to go out at 6( *.
The dour, grey old

THE UNKNOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
War's anniversaries we celebrate,
Great days of days in memory to keep;
And here and there, some few in splendid
state,
Myriads on mead and plain, by range or
strait,
The Unknown Soldiers sleep.
Tribute we pay to those the hosts that led,
Who bridged the desert or who scaled the
steep ;
The while, where city babel sweeps o’erhead
Or in the blood-soaked fields, now poppy-red.
'The Unknown Soldiers sleep.
The lustrous deeds with pride we still recall,
The dead who live therein with mourning
deep;
In chant of praise our voices rise and fall
For those we knew and loved. And through
it all
’Pile Unknown Soldiers sleep.
The glory that they earned not theirs to
share,
'The bays they died to win not theirs to
reap.
Amid the paean and the requiem spare
A thought for —shrined or in oblivion —
where
The Unknown Soldiers sleep.

Chrysler initiated today's vogue

Chrysler Standardised Quality
is a fixed and inflexible quality
standard which enforces the
same scrupulously close limits
—the same rigid rule of engi-
neering exactness —the same ab-
solute accuracy and precision of
alignment and assemblage —in
the measurement, the machin-
ing and the manufacturing of
every part, practice and process
in four lines of Chrysler cars.
It is easy to understand how the new, finer Chrysler “70”
forecasts a fresh vogue in motoring.
Newer, more exquisitely graceful bodies —newer, more dis-
tinctive silhouette with military front and cadet visor -
newer lowness of design newer luxury of comfort
newer, greater riding ease —newer richness of upholstery
—newer perfection of appointment —newer refinements in
controls and lighting, with a lock conveniently placed on
the dash —newer, more attractive colour blendings far in
advance of current harmonies.
In the new “70” is discovered Chrysler’s characteristic speed
and acceleration, unvarying dependability and enduring
long life, proved by hundreds of thousands of owners. But,
in addition is this new eye-compelling beauty and alluring
luxury and comfort, leaving today’s trend as far behind as
the original Chrysler led the styles of three years ago.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“W. 0.3” : Recently I had the rare oppor-
tunity of witnessing the birth of a ’roo-let.
The mother, a tame grev
wallaroo- adjusted her tail
carefully between her legs.
The joey was born on to the
tail and almost immediately
commenced to climb towards
the mother’s pouch. Ma
showed great concern, touch-
ins- the mite at intervals with
her paws and lips. As he
neared the mouth of the
pouch she held it onen with
her paws; as he gained the
edge she put her head down
and seemed to take him in
her lips. Nothing further
could be seen till she re-
moved her head, when he was
observed to be attached to
the nipple. The whole process
occupied about a quarter of an hour.
* * * *
“Elgar”: If “Bihai’s” leaky oil-tank
(B. 31/3/’27) was made of sheet-iron, J-in.
thick, it could have been easily caulked, from
outside, with a plaster of red lead and tar,
on a piece of calico. I doubt, however, if
the viscous oil would allow it to set. Many
people have an idea that cement will stop
a leak at the bottom of a tank. It won’t,
because the iron expands with heat and so
breaks away from the cement. The “wor-
ried official” who put cement and sawdust
into a tank of oil was the limit.
* * * *
“Tongio West”: Although black brethren
have acquired a liking for the strong waters
of the white man, alcoholic drink was known
to their race before Jack Tar with his “Yo
ho! and a bottle of rum” touched these
shores. A species of wild-plum grows about
the hills of Eastern Gippsland. Members
of three tribes informed me that from time
immemorial it had been the custom to fer-
ment the fruit in rough bowls for several
days and squeeze the juice out. Although
harmless-looking, it possesses a kick that
makes overproof whisky seem like lemonade.
I know 1 , because I was once rash enough to
sample it.
* * * *
“Bill R.”: The landowners of the N. S.
Wales southern tablelands no longer regard
the rabbit as a serious menace. During the
last decade, from the county of Argyle to
the Victorian border the cottontails had
control of the pastures. Freezing-factories
were established at Bombala, Nimmitabel.
Jindabyne, Cooma and Bungendore. Rab-
biters were for the time being the moneyed
men of the land, and poison -carts spread
devastation over grass-bare holdings. Now,
for want of supplies, the freezing-works at
each of those centres have been closed down,
the rabbiters have trekked elsewhere, and
a hunter may search for a day without find-
ing a bunny. The extermination of the
pest commenced op Currandooley station, by
Lake George. The runs were wire-netted,
then gangs of men dug out the warrens, and
a dogman with a nondescript pack of tykes
cleaned up the stragglers.
* * * *
“Dingo”: In the treatment of strychnine
poisoning by bluestone, “X2X” (B.
14/4/’27) apparently knows only one class
of antidote, the chemical, whereas there are
three : the chemical, the mechanical and the
physiological. Used against strychnine
poisoning in dogs, bluestone belongs to the
second class, as it is a powerful emetic which
rids the stomach of the poison. So power-
ful is it that it is practically impossible to
kill with it any animal capable ot vomiting,
as it is retained only a few seconds after
being swallowed. I have used bluestone and
have seen it used with complete success
dozens of times, and many old drovers are
never without a supply. On the other hand
it does act as a chemical antidote in poison-
ing by phosphorus, which it renders in-
active.
“Up North”: Half-baked ’gator eggs are
things to be wary of. A few hours of steady
heat may produce a bunch of little furies
ready for fight from the shell. Their teeth
are like needles. A cobber of mine took
a dozen eggs to bed with him to prove in
liis own cocksure way that the older know-
alls were liars. Just before daylight that
lad arose with a shriek that rattled the
rafters. He bounced only once before hit-
ting the door backwards, with a baby 'gator
fastened to his sit-me-down. On one of the
old Gulf boats a steward brought aboard a
bucket of eggs to show his friends in Syd-
ney. He stowed the bucket under the bath,
which happened to be above the boiler-
room. The warmth did the business, and
a lady passenger, clad in nothing but soap,
burst from the bathroom and ran screaming
along the deck. The third mate, a strong
man, gave the doctor trouble for the re-
mainder of the trip with palpitation of the
heart.
* * * *
“S.” : I have often seen the juice of ripe
inkweed berries used in bush-camps to write
with. It is a convenient substitute for cor-
respondence where the mail doesn’t take
more than a veek to arrive. The writing
PLAIN PROOF HE DIDN’T MEAN
TO GO.
BOSS: “Aw full thing young Jackson commit-
ting suicide, Jacky!”
J ACKY: “Mine tinkit accident, Boss. You
bin see bottle rum longa ’im not touched?”
is purple at first, but gradually fades; in
a few days it has gone. Another ink-
black —was extracted from blue-gum bark;
it is said to have been used for printing
official papers over 100 years ago. Some
scrub berries and scrub barks also make
ink without any preparation.
* * * *
“J.McG.” : A mate and I were practising
for a sparrow match. Whenever we went
out with the guns our pet magpie followed
and soon learned on the discharge of a shot
to fly and grab the sparrow and hold it.
LANGUAGE yearly failed him.
THE GIRL: “Are you happy now I’ve promised to marry you, Dave dear?”
DAVE DEAR: “Too right I am! I feel like as if one of the cows had got a first at the
Show.”
This it would do whether the sparrow was
hit or not. Sometimes Mag, on seeing me
lift the gun, would jump on the muzzle and
take her start from that point, making me
miss my bird; but provided the gun were
discharged, Maggie got the sparrow all the
same.
* * * *
“Jan Van Esse”: Some Australian gully
tree-ferns must be of great age. Assuming
that a fern throws out at most two sets of
leaves from the crown p.a., some of the giant
specimens must be hundreds of years old.
The tree-fern stands up wonderfully to the
fiercest bush-fire. However blackened
and charred the trunk or stem may be,
the next spring brings a new burst of
fresh green from the apparently dead
stump.
“V.E.” : The big black magpie-squirrel
(Pctaurus), a somewhat rare animal, be-
tokens its presence by a harsh, whirring
scream, uttered at night; but, according to
a bushman about whose tent they prowl,
the little grey sugar-squirrels give a soft cry
somewhat resembling the call of the barn-
owl. They sometimes become the prey of
cats. Just recently I picked up near a door-
step the burred tail of one of these squirrels
—all that remained of it.
* * # *
“ Jesmond”: Out in the dinghy the other
day I came across a fair-sized octopus and
a big bull seal having an argument. Most
of the fighting was done under water, but
when the seal came up for a breather it
seemed as if the octopus was having it all
his own way. Every time they rose the
arms of the octopus completely covered the
seal’s head; however, by shaking liis head
much as a dog does when worrying a rabbit,
he was able to throw off the suckers. Then
he let go liis hold and the octopus dis-
appeared in his own ink. The seal dived
again, and in a minute or two reappeared
with the enemy, the shaking process being
repeated. This went on until the octopus
began to lose his arms and chunks of his
body. Soon the seal was enjoying a feed
on the little that remained.
* * * *
“Hatter” : I know of an authentic instance
where a goanna swallowed a setting of valu-
able eggs a few days before they were due
to hatch. The raid was discovered early in
the morning and the intruder found. After
killing it tenderly the owner extracted the
warm and unbroken eggs and returned them
to the nest —none the worse, as subsequent
events proved, for the adventure.
“Kooragi”: Scrub-felling, especially on
steep hillsides, is a job that has brought
disaster to many a newchum. No veteran
will tackle it with a mate who has had no
experience. He prefers to cut in alone ; or
he sets work for the new hand at a distant
point where he can’t harm anybody. It's a
very different tiling from felling in a forest,
whre only one tree goes down at a time, and
the axeman knows the direction in which it
will fall. In the scrub the limbs and branches
of the trees are intertwined, and most of the
clustered mass is lashed together with a
network of vines. The axeman cuts the trees
only partly through, merely nicking the small
ones; and when he has thus gone over hall
an acre or an acre of ground, he cuts down
a big tree, which carries the whole tangled
mass with it in a single drive. 'The danger
of working with an inexperienced mate is
that he may cut too far through a heavy
tree, or put liis cuts in on the wrong side,
which may result in an unexpected crash,
either then or later on, should a strong wind
catch the tops.
* * * *
“Vraidex” : Turtles are usually particular
about the spot where they lay their eggs,
and choose a shady, secluded beach. A
surprising lapse on the part of one creature
startled bathers at Emu Park (C.Q.). The
turtle crawled out of the sea and laboriously
made its way up to a bathing-shed, under-
AT THE SHOW.
FIRST WAYBACK : “Oh, ’IM? That's the "bloke
that knows all about pedigree cattle.”
SECOND WAYBACK: “Yairs, but who’s the
girl?”
FIRST WAYBACK: “She’s ’is shorthorn
typist !”
neath which, before an admiring crowd, it
scooped out a nest and laid 50-odd eggs.
Then it turned and, ignoring the bystanders,
struggled back into the ocean.

FAILURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From Miggin’s pub came ringing clear
A hearty cheer
That smelt of beer,
And echoed down the land.
And here and there along the road
From wharc doors the cockies strode
To grasp the old man’s hand.
They swore he “did the distric' proud,”
And wished him luck, with praises aloud
That set his eyes aglow—
The send-off was a sight to see
When Dad entrained with Strawberree—
()ur milkin’ shorthorn Strawberree —
Bound for the Royal Show!
When he returned (the sequel’s sad!)
No greetings glad
Saluted Dad,
No acclamation rose.
He slunk along like one wlio’d sinned,
While at their doors the cockies grinned,
With shrewd “I told yer sos.”
From passers-by all down the road
Triumphant smiles of malice showed
They one and all knew how
Dad’s pilgrimage had been in vain;
Ard back to Boggy Flat again
He'd come with Strawberree —a plain,
Umlecorated cow!
Dad’s case —and Strawberree’s, so to speak—
Is not unique.
When fame we seek
Grim failure’s oft in store.
We plot and strive with all the skill
We can command, while others spill
Encomiums galore.
But when, a dud, we come a thud,
When Fortune rolls us in the mud,
And to defeat we bow,
The chain of friendship shows the rust;
We shelve in fellow-man our trust
And disillusioned term him just
What Strawberry is—a cow !

| ONE of the greatest aggregations of cars that Australia has seen will
help swell the throng that will attend the Official Ceremonies at
Canberra on May 9th. It will be a red letter day in Australia’s history and
the automobile will play an important part in ensuring the success of this great function.
How many motorists to-day give a thought to what J. B. Dunlop’s invention of the
pneumatic tyre in 1888 has meant in the development of Australia. Twenty-two years back the
Dunlop Company organised, at its own expense, the first great Reliability Contest between Sydney
and Melbourne— with a view of demonstrating to the Australian public that the
automobile was eminently suited for Australian conditions—and was destined
to materially assist in Opening Up this country. Those pioneering days are gone and
1927 finds some 350,000 motor cars and trucks spread throughout the Commonwealth proving
invaluable in our social, commercial and industrial life. It is worth remembering that it was the
invention of the “Dunlop” that has made all this possible and it is also worthy of note that the tyre
which was foremost in 1888 has remained foremost ever since —and to-day offers Australian motorists
unsurpassed service and value. You can fit “Dunlop” and be sure of satisfaction. All Garages stoc

PLAIN FIGUKES-
“Up North” : The myall binghi is ingenious
in contriving patterns wherewith to decorate
his cobber’s body. The backbone of a
fish is dipped into ochre and the pattern
imprinted upon the warrior. Sticks are cut
and trimmed into knobs and bars and circles
and used for a pattern as civilised man uses
a rubber stamp. The impression of finger-
nails, birds’ claws and queer native hiero-
glyphics are pressed into the soft bone of a
cuttlefish, the grooves filled with ochre and
imprinted upon the flapper’s or warrior’s
body. The binghi on the skirts of civilisa-
tion has adopted the “comb pattern.” much
to the envy of his myall brothers. He dips
TACKLING IT FROM THE BOTTOM.
UNCLE CORNCOB: “Now, come on and I'll leach you how to mill ; a coir!”
THE JACKROO: “Oh, Uncle, I'm not used to cores, y'know—what about learning on a
calf, eh — what?"
a broken comb in ochre and prints the pat-
tern of the teeth, variegating it with a frag-
ment of smaller comb. Amongst odd coastal
tribes there is a more highly educated artist
who uses the starfish and the delicately-
curled shells, the ornamental flower-pods and
berries, as his mould for the color patterns.
But most abos. are still in the Stone Age,
and fantastic daubs upon the body with
ochre-tipped fingers mark their limits in art.
“Tongio West”: Old patients of No. Id
Military Hospital at Macleod (Vic.) will
remember the ’possum in the Y.M.C.A. hall.
Every night pictures or popular concerts
were held there for the wounded Diggers,
but no show was complete without the chief
member of the audience. About eight o’clock
each night all eyes were turned toward the
joists of the roof; and punctually a ’possum
would make her appearance, amid loud
applause. For about a fortnight she was
missing, and sadness reigned ; but when one
night she reappeared with a young ’possum
the cheers could have been heard almost at
Heidelberg, three miles away.

“Veronal”: A dweller in the South Coast
IN. S. Wales) cow-country flatly accuses
the peregrinative porcupine ant-eater (Echid-
na hysirix) of visiting Blossom while she
is camped for the night and of sucking tin 1
milk from her teats. I have never seen
pore, at this game, nor even caught one
wandering in the vicinity of the bails. Dur-
ing the breeding season milk exudes from
the lacteal glands in the pouch of mother
porcupine and is licked up by her young
ones. It does not follow, however, that the
adult pore, has a taste for cow’s milk. Can
any scribe enlighten me on this point?
* * * *
“Simon”: Over the Wellington (N.S.W.)
caves stands an ancient gum-tree. Seventy
feet from the surface a two-inch root pene-
trates the dome of one of the caves and re-
enters the floor, still going strong. The
point that interests me is what possible
advantage even a heavy rainfall could be to
such deeply-seated vegetables.
* * * *
“Biru”: Amphibious mammals have no
teats. Baby platypuses and seals press their
faces against the mother’s breast, the former
merely licking up the secretion, the latter
fastening on to the flesh. Young seals cannot
even float. Six or seven of them learn to swim
together in small pools of salt water on the
rocks. They have a lot of practice before
they become proficient there and a lot more
before going freely into the sea. Of all wild
creatures seals are probably the most affec-
tionate. They also display intelligence of a
high order.
* * * *
“Chloe” : The most remarkable Australian
tree spider is found in North Westralia. In
youth she builds an inconspicuous nest on
the underside of a big gum or warralong leaf.
Reaching the flapper stage she grows rest-
less, makes many short threads from her
nest, and, to the accompaniment of clappers on
her spinnerets or hindmost legs, practises a
song and dance. The aborigines call her the
singing spider. When she lias perfected her
athletics she sets out to make her web, watch-
ing the wind till it sets just right to carry
her silk cable to the desired spot. When the
first thread has been placed she may have to
wait many weeks before getting a definite
number of radials attached to various spots.
Finally she weaves over the perfect sets a
circle of the most delicate lace pattern, yet
strong enough to resist a changing wind. She
dunces at regular intervals either on her lace
carpet or on one of the tight ropes, her cas-
tanets keeping up their music. One day there
appears from a hole in the earth a rather
bored but well-conditioned bachelor. She
drops him a thread and the castanets rattle
whilst the lady dances. Sometimes the lover
ascends straightway; others climb up a little
way, hesitate, and climb down. If thus
scorned the lady gets frenzied. She gallops
round her lace course and leaps and capers.
then drawing herself into a very small bulk
sulks in the centre of the web: but before
doing so she lets fall another ladder to the
hesitant lover. Next day the scene is played
over. Romeo, no longer hesitant, climbs up
to the web. They meet and embrace, and in
the embrace tlm lover finds his death. Then
she dines on him.
“HEY, YOU STILL AT BREAKFUS’! YOU’LL WANT TO KNOCK OFF FOR
DINNER, Y'KNOW!”
“F.S.”: I don’t know why London should,
as reported, be excited about the Australian
eucalypt and its amazing growth. There are
plenty of gums scattered about England,
There is a blue-gum at Penzance which, judg-
ingby its size, is over 50 years of age. And some
specimens on the Continent are so large as to
suggest that the old Dutch voyagers picked
up a seed or two on the Westralian coast,
Lloyd George, Nitti and Millerand met at
the San Remo conference under a splendid
example which stands in the grounds of the
Villa de Varchan. My grandfather sent
seeds of S. Australian gums to Norwich 90
years ago.

“AdeL,”: The numerous and extensive
snow-white sand beaches about the Gulf of
Carpentaria are destined to become great
popular resorts some day. During the
winter months, when the sou’-easter blows,
the sea retreats miles, not to return for
four months, leaving in its trail vast
stretches of dry sands, scintillating with a
multitude of rare and exquisitively colored
shellfish of all shapes and sizes, Here and
there, some hundreds of yards back from the
coast, spring countless rivulets of water,
sweet, azure-colored. The extensiveness of
tliese beaches, lined along the shore by giant
slie-oaks, with a background of immense
rolling sand-dunes, makes them unrivalled,

“Roycha” : You can’t beat the man out-
back for ingenuity. I drove through a small
selection out Moroe (N.S.W.) way. A
shearer was busily clipping the fleece from
a sheep, while 15 other woollies stood around
awaiting their turn. But, instead of the
usual sheep-pen, six black dogs, sharp-
teethed and alert, sat on their haunches
and took the place of a fence.
“Tarwin” : Why has the butcher-bird been
so named (B. 24/3/’27) ? According to abo.
lore, the birds of tin 1 bush once held a mas*
meeting to discover and bring to trial tin 1
culprit that was eating their eggs. All
except the owl turned up, and a parrot,
at that time a bird of no particular color.
brought along a parcel of eggshells found
under the owl’s nest. Being unwilling to
judge the owl in his absence, they adjourned
the trial for 24 hours, but when the court
reassembled it was shocked at the spectacle
of a plucked parrot staggering to his seat
on the grand jury. When he testified to
having been assaulted by the owl, again an
absentee, that settled it, and sentence of
death was passed. The hat was then sent
round for a collection to clothe the shivering
parrot; each bird gave a feather —hence
Joey’s multi-colored coat. The court then
had to appoint an executioner, and the
choice fell on a harmless little member of
the jackass elan, who went completely off
his block when he heard of the ghoulish
job ahead of him. He flew into the bush a
whistling maniac, slaughtering all and
sundry in a fruitless search for the owl,
who, having been listening-in all the while,
had decided to spend the rest of his days
indoors. So the ’‘butcher,” Binghi’s lunatic
of bird-land, still takes liis daily toll while
the wise old owl flies by night,

“Mat”: Ho dingoes, after recovering from
the effects of poison, become immune from
it? Our camp being visited by a dingo, we
put some dripping and strychnine in an old
meat-tin and left it in the open for him.
He licked out the lot and trotted away.
Two days later he reappeared, and again
on the following day, on each occasion the
strychnine-eating performance having appar-
ently no ill-effects.

“Yufu” : Why is it that the pretty reserves
of scrubwoods sprinkled about the North
Coast (N.S.W.) are dying out? A few years
ago, at almost every crossing of a road over
any of the rivers or creeks, one of these
clumps of timber stood, offering a camping-
ground for teamsters and a refreshing s glit
for travellers. The trees were matted with
vines, all the growth being vigorous and
luxuriant, but at the present time most of
these reserves look like dogs with the mange.
A few stricken trees stand, with weeds and
blackberries tangled on the ground. The.
virgin growth- seems to have given up the
job of living and have died away. Some
of the shire councils have taken notice and
have issued warnings that to chop or damage
any of the growth in the few remaining
nooks will involve a heavy penalty.
WEATHER WISDOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A Hawkesbury (N.S.W.) pioneer enjoys more
ocal fame as a weather prophet than Mr. Mares. He
uses no instruments, contenting himself with inten-
sive study of the river. His knowledge, he explains,
was acquired from his father, who learnt his
weather wisdom from the Hawkesbury River abo-
rigines.”
Wise is the weather prophet who is born of
the native soil;
His is the wisdom garnered from centuries of
toil.
He looks at the purling river, and in its
depths he sees
Cycles of drought or wetness —and nobody
disagrees.
A bubble or two on its surface shows to
him not in vain—
’Look to your dams,” he counsels; “for it's
coming in sheets, the rain."
When the small fish come to the edges he
takes due heed of the sign ;
For there the water is mudless when the
streams to floods incline.
When the small black ants are leaving their
nests by the -river’s rim
And stock to the full their larders, take heed
if you cannot swim !
For the lore of the ants is pregnant with
knowledge beyond man’s ken—
They were wise in the days ere monkeys
climbed down from trees to be men.
When the darkies shift to the hillsides, and
refrain from explaining why,
But semaphore just a finger at a brassy,
cloudless sky ;
When they lay in a store of codfish, and
blaze the opossum tree,
Beware of the coming deluge, for mighty
the rains will be!
Your weather bureaus and winders are
right enough in their way.
At least they attempt to warn us—though
often they go astray!
But the black, with his knack uncanny and
his uncomplaining gins,
As the Oracle of the Weather pledges his
word —and wins !

OATS FOR FODDER.
“Ziff” : 1 differ with “J.D.C.” over the value
of hay as a fodder to be conserved as a
standby in- drought. Oats straight, as a food
ior sheep and cows—horses, too, if you go
th ' right way about it—are much more prac-
ticable. “Bulk in food” is last year’s idea ;
ana straw at any time is not much good in
an animal’s stomach. Labor is also a problem
for most of us cookies. It takes two and often
three men to handle hay—stacking and chaff-
cutting, as instances. But oats straight can
be harvested and stacked by any healthy
man and stored out of the reach of mice—a
few posts sunk in the ground, a kerosene tin
slipped over the top of each and a platform
of sticks will provide accommodation for a
couple of hundred bags, with no expense but
the labor. If a cocky wishes to keep the
rain out a few sheets of iron will do it. I
have stored oats and barley this way for the
last eight years and now I cannot afford not
to do it. If the season has come in right I
have sold out —often at a higher price than
I could have got at harvest time on a glutted
market —and if we struck the dry I had no
worries or losses.
An advance on hay from the Government
is not practicable, in my opinion, as farmers
are not much more honest than other men,
and the opportunities for monkey tricks would
be legion. The administrative costs, too, I
should imagine, would just about finance a
drought-relief fund. “J.D.C.” did not tell
us how he was going to protect his hay from
the mice, and any scheme which fails in that
precaution is liable to be demolished.
Oats are easy to grow and conserve and
are the best all-round stock food there is.
When the cockies fully appreciate their worth
farms will be stocked much higher than they
are at the present.
MIXED BALES.
“Trepex”: One of the stupid things that
wool-growers do, as observed on the floors
of the wool-selling brokers, is to make mixed
bales that could be avoided. This foolish-
ness is not confined to the little clips; the
big ones exhibit it too, and with far less
excuse. No doubt it is hard for the wool-
presser to gauge exactly the quantity of
wool in the bins so as to finish up with full
bales of even description. Having, say, half
a bale of each of two descriptions left, it
is very tempting to make them into one full-
weight bale —a shandy, as it is called. But
one should beware of temptations. Very
often one half of the shandy does not suit
the man who wants to buy the other half.
The bale has to be sold by itself in the star
lots, while a big lot of each of the two
separate descriptions is offered in its proper
place. Nearly always the star bale brings
less money than either of the two lots. Even
when it can be worked in, it has to go with
the lot of lower description. A 3601 b. bale
of first and second pieces is offered, the
second pieces in which may easily make
2d. per lb. less than the firsts. That bale
will go at second-pieces price. The loss of
2d. on the 1801 b. of firsts is thirty bob —
not much, perhaps, but too much to throw
away. It is quite easily avoided. If a man
finds at the end that he has only half a bale
left of two separate qualities, he would do
well to unpack a bale of each and make
up two light bales rather than brew this
terrible shandy affair. At the most it would
cost him ten bob and his bit of trouble, and
he would thus show a clear saving of a
pound. Perhaps he doesn't think it worth
while, but I’ll bet he would take more than
the same amount of trouble to save a live
sheep of the same value.
INSURANCE AND CROP-FIRES.
“Saaedi” : It is hear<} on all sides at the
present time —it has become parrot talk —•
that over-insurance of crops is responsible
for many bush-fires. I don’t believe it. For
one thing it isn’t so easy to collect much
in excess of a crop’s value, and for another,
while there might be some farmers fraudulent
enough to fire a field, there are very few
so foolish as to risk burning their fences,
homes and grassland in the process. Wher-
ever a crop is burnt for the sake of the
insurance, it would surely be found that
steps had been taken to prevent the flames
from escaping to adjoining lands. What the
reputable insurance cos. might well do is
to make it far more generally known that
if a man has an 18-bushel crop and he in-
sures it for 24 bushels, he can recover only
three-fourths of the value of the 18 bushels.
GRASS-SEEDS.
■ J.D.C.” : One of the penalties of a good sea-
son is grass-seed. Heavy country does not pro-
duce such a virulent type, and though injury
may result to the wool, and neglect may
cause a few blind sheep, the death-rate is
slight on that soil. Seeds, such as trefoil,
Bathurst-burr, bindii and Bogan flea, can
completely ruin a clip, but have little effect
on the health of the sheep. Sometimes in a
new blanket or heavy flannel a much bat-
tered but still recognisable Bathurst-burr is
found, showing that it has stuck fast through
every process of manufacture. Bindii, com-
mon in green or newly-rung country, will
sometimes give a sheep the appearance of a
brown mass, and still cause no injury to the
animal.
About the worst seeds in Australia are
several species of corkscrew, speargrass, wire-
grass (No. 10) and barley-grass. The last
is deadly in lambs’ eyes, but for general
effect is not nearly as bad as the other trio.
Barley-grass is a heavy-soil product, while
the others occur mainly in light redsoil coun-
try of a sandy nature. On much of the pine-
and box-country of N. 8. Wales, corkscrew
and crowfoot (which also has a corkscrew
seed) are the main growths, and a heavy
crop of the former has at times caused
enormous loss. In spring and early summer
it is next to impossible to put enough stock
on to eat it down, so rapid is the growth.
Usually the danger period lasts only five
or six weeks, but with early summer rains
a second and even a third crop of seed may
develop, causing endless trouble. At that
season of the year sheep will stand a fair
ALWAYS SOME CATCH IN IT.
MR. BEAU BRIMMEL: “Congratulations, madam—eggs are up another threepence, I see.”
MRS. PEPERTONGUE : “Yes, I know — they’ll he trying all sorts of messes now to make us
work overtime again!”
amount of starvation, and it pays many
times over to keep them on short commons
in preference to turning them into the seed.
If compelled to put them into a seedy pad-
dock, leave them severely alone, as in 10
minutes’ driving and resultant “ringing” they
will pick up more seed than in a week under
normal conditions.
For seed in the eyes there is only one
remedy—every sheep must be handled and
the seed removed, preferably with a pair of
blunt forceps. After removal of the seeds
the eye should be bathed in a solution of
four parts boracic, two parts sulphate of
zinc, 100 parts water. If applied through
a blunt-nosed syringe, the eyes can be more
thoroughly cleansed in the corners and
under the lids. Ordinary “pinkeye” is. aggra-
vated by the pollen and dust, and ii. taken
early can be cured by the above mixture.
Once the eyeball has become white and the
typical red centre appears, it is very difficult
to prevent at least partial loss of sight.
For seed on the body and legs the safest
plan is to run the machines over them and
then swim the mob. It is more like chaffing
than shearing, and plays ancient Henry with
the machines, but results are worth while.
Much of the seed is cut off, and the drag of
the machines, with the vibration and lateral
motion of the cutters, lifts and loosens the
hard head-portions left in the hide. If soaked
and softened immediately, most of the seed
will come right away; but of course nothing
will shift those already through the hide. If
no open water is. available for swimming,
the dip will answer the purpose if the sheep
are kept in a bit longer than usual. But
be sure there is no (lip in the water. If
seedy sheep are put through a dip mixture,
the skin, being a mass of punctures, will take
up sufficient poison to cause serious trouble.
It is not necessary to shear all over the
sheep, as the seeds are mainly about the
legs, bellies and head. About 20 years ago,
when the wrinkly Vermont was so popular,
a type of lamb was produced with a flange
on each side of the face which apparently
served no other purpose than to gather seeds,
and the loss of these sheep on seedy coun-
try was terrific. The swing-back to the
plainer-bodied, clean-faced sheep is all to
the good, and the man with “corkscrew”
country is well advised to leave wrinkles
alone.
IS TAR-BRANDING NECESSARY?
“Bidgee” : “Bill R.’s” defence of tar-brand-
ing (B. 14/4/’27) scarcely agrees with my
own fairly extensive experience. He admits
that earmarks are not his long suit, stating
that “nearly every sheep has to be handled”
to see the mark, and he also drafts by the
tar-brand. If a man is a dealer and has
various earmarks in his flock, these sheep
will carry the same tar-brand after the first
shearing. How is he going to separate them
if not by the earmark? All drafting for age
is done by the “age” mark, the sexes are
separated by the registered mark being placed
in opposite ears, and, as all carry the same
brand, the latter is not even referred to.
A tar-brand is quite easy to alter, and
generally is altered in cases of sheep-steal-
ing ; but since “cropping” is now an offence
under tlie N. S. Wales Act, a good earmark
is difficult to obliterate.
In scrubby country, where the fleece is con-
stantly being raked by twigs, or in the case
of open-woolled sheep, a tar-brand is a very
unreliable means of identification when near-
ing the full-fleece period, but the earmark
remains unaltered. When drafting, the man
on the gate must stand almost directly in
front of the sheep : he picks out the earmark
as the sheep enter the race, and probably
doesn’t even see the brand.
If a brand is legible at anything like 12
months, it is safe to bet that a lot of scouring
will be required to remove the effects from
the fleece. This is what the manufacturers
complain of, as special people are required,
after tile scouring process, to remove by hand
the stained and discolored fibres to which the
branding material still adheres.
It would be interesting to get the opinions
of other sheepmen. I have frequently to hang
over a gate for seven or eight hours on end,
drafting at least three ways at once. The
whole of my work is done by earmarks, and
the brands are seldom even mentioned. Do
others manage in the same way?
THE WOOL-DEALER.
“E.S.W.” : “Trepex” (B. 7/4/’2T), speak-
ing of the grievances of those who shear
late, says : “As for waiting, that only happens
the first year. After that their cheque comes
at a 12-months’ interval, just the same as any
other man’s. They do not suffer on an
average.” I think I can show that that
is not so. A western (N.S.W.) man
shears early, and has his wool in the sale-
room by August 15, sells at once, and gets
his cheque by September 15. B, in New
England, starts shearing late in November,
and finishes early in December. A buyer
then offers him Sydney parity for the wool
as it lies in his shed, cash on delivery. Not
wishing to encourage the country selling, he
refuses the offer, and gets his wool into store
in Sydney by December 15. Now, if he
could sell at once and get his cheque by
January 15, lie would be in the same position
as A, and would lose nothing. But, owing to
the (unavoidable) spreading of the sales and
the Christmas holidays, his wool is not sold
for months, and he does not get his chequ-'
until, say, April 15, thus losing interest for
three months. And this he will continue to
lose every year as long as he conducts his
business in that way. He might have saved
still another month’s interest by selling at
his own shed. I say nothing about changes
in price during the interval; that might work
either way, and only confuses the issue.
WHAT THEIR HEADS SHOW.
“Hatter” : “Up Top” hits the nail squarely
in his remarks on the physiognomy of the
horse (B. 31/3/’27). “By their foreheads
ye shall know them” is dinkum advice to any
would-be purchaser. The horse with a narrow,
retreating brow is invariably stupid for his
owner’s purposes, though often cunning
enough to be troublesome, and is, besides, fre-
quently vicious. A man who wants sagacity
should look for broad faces —breadth between
the eyes to give kindly intelligence, and
breadth of jaw to give staying power. Same
thing applies to dogs. A trainer who was
remarkably successful in teaching dogs, on
being asked how he picked his pupils replied
that he always chose the broad-browed ones.
Since then I have been interested to notice
that the cleverest dogs of my acquaintance
have all been of this type.
“SUBTERRANEAN” CLOVER.
“8.T.”: "The so-called “subterranean”
clover, a remarkable little plant which is
said to have originated at Mount Barker,
near Adelaide, promises to add millions to
the value of certain classes of land. It is
now well established in both South Aus.
and Westralia, and the demand for seed
from all over the country is greater than the
supply. It does best in cool country with a
good rainfall, -whether the land be rich or
poor. I can speak from personal experience.
Some years ago I owned an extensive run
in the south-east of South Aus. It was
cold, wet and swampy in winter, and became
hard and dry in summer. It carried about
one sheep to two acres, and after many ups
and downs I was glad to quit at £2 per acre.
The other day I visited the land and could
scarcely believe my eyes. It was covered
with a dense mass of clover nearly a foot in
height, with fat sheep and lambs grazing
on it at the rate of eight to an acre. A
tenner an acre would not buy it to-day; yet
all that was done was to scarify the seed in
with a liberal supply of super, and let nature
do the rest.
RING-BARKING CURRANT VINES.
“Mirrool”: Re accidents leading to dis-
coveries (B. 7/4/’27). Nowadays just before
the currant vine at Griffith (N.S.W.) is at
the end of its blossoming it is lightly ring-
barked. Before this practice came into vogue
the rush of sap caused the young berries to
fall before they had properly set, so the vines
are rung now, and this checks the flow and
gives the berries time .to set properly. An
orcliardist’s son was trying his new pocket-
knife some years ago and ring-barked a few
vines—and of course got spanked. His father
decided afterwards that, as all fruit had set
on those vines and none fallen off, there
might be something in the ring-barking. He
tried it again with the same success. The
boy had discovered the way to make a good
crop stay good.

God made Man, the last and most

placed
Him in a Garden of Ease and Abundance,
Made Woman- —the Perfect Animal—and
Placed her with Man and told them to
Live Happily there by Obeying the Laws of
Nature, like all His other Animals.
But of all the Animals that God made
Man and Woman alone decided not to
Obey the Laws of Nature. Then God
Inflicted upon them the Most Dreadful
Punishment that He could think of:
He endowetl them with Memory.

The cottages fronting one street in a dull

“Good mornin’, Mr. Mutely,” said his next-

“She’s just about the same,” old Mutely

“I’m sorry to hear that,” said the neigh-

The spruikers at the Sydney Show don’t
get it all their own way. One of them, damp
but still energetic, was trying to sell a cheap
pair of field-glasses to a stranger from Never-
tire. “F'rom my home on Bellevue Hill,” said
the Splendid Liar, “with the help of these
identical glasses I can pick out the trees on
the Blue Mountains.” “No good to me,”
answered the man from Nevertire. “I was out
there meself on Monday and could do that
with me naked eye.” “Yes,” the Splendid
Liar persisted, “but I was going to tell
you that I could see the little birds flitting
from bough to bough. I guess you want
these glasses, after all.” “Birds!” replied
the man from Nevertire. “Why, I says to
the friend I was with—‘Bill,’ I says, ‘those
birds don’t keep themselves too clean. See
the lice on ’em?’ Then Bill he looked. ‘Gripes,’
lie says, ‘yes—and some of ’em’s lavin’ eggs
in the poor little things’ feathers.’ ”
“Yes,” said old Dan, “fishin’ and women
are just about the same—the more yer know
of ’em the more you’ve got to learn. There’s
not many can tell me much about the game,
but I got knocked a sixer one time up the
’Awkesb’ry. I’d been catchin’ a fair number
o’ fish, although they wiz a bit on the small
side, the best bream bein’ about 51b. and a
flat’ead about 10, when orl of a sudden
things started to go crook. No, the fish
didn’t go off the bite; I was hittin’ ’em
all right, but after a few runs I’d lose ’em.
It got me fair beat, because gen’rally when
I hits a fish, ’e’s mine. I knoo it wasn’t
sharks, ’cause as a rule them cows leave the
’eads on, for manners. At last I fires out a
’eavier line with a wire snooze on. Some-
thin’ soon grabbed it, an’ I pinned ’im good
an’ ’ard. ’E put up a decent fight, but I
made a cert not to give ’im too much of ’is
’ead. When I gets ’im in close enough, I
see he was a decent flat’ead, about 141 b. And
then I solves the myst’ry. Sittin’ stroddle-
legged across ’is napper was a big blue crab
tryin’ ’is ’ardest to unsnooze' the ’ook. But
the wire ’ad ’im beat, an’ ’e let go just as
I lifted ole flattie aboard. But to this day
what flummoxes me is whether that crab was
just a cobber of the flattie, or whether he
made a business of cuttin’ fish loose.”

The reason ? This—
He toasted me a radiant, smiling bride.
Because he’d call
“He grows a man, your little son .
My tears must fall—
To-day the dear old Colonel's course is run.
When I, too. die,
In self-same way will hearts be wrung?
I hear them cry—

Lead me, lead me to the ocean, let me feel

As the rollers biff the vessel when she

As a sailorman hard-bitten let me view the
track storm-smitten
Where the seamew calls its kitten on the
way to Kandahar.
Let us load her to the uppers, tie the tow-
rope round the scuppers,
While the skipper rigs my berth up, and
the cook prepares the tea.
Rolling- home by Bluff and Ban try, we can
shelter in the pantry
When the deadly catspaw scratches at the
surface of the sea.
Then it’s yo-ho-ho, an’ heave ’er! If you’ve
got a sweetheart leave ’er,
For toe’re always rather casual, us chaps
that breast the foam.
All toy ether in a chantey till our breath is
cornin’ pant-y
As we jazz around the capstan an’ tee
roll the anchor home.
First we’ll splice the mizzen for’a’d while the

And the Old Man’s voice floats gently from

“Ho ! Belay ! Avast your prattlin’s, furl the

So we trim her, spar an’ gun’l, davits, hal-

While the spray is on our whiskers as we

Often at the wheel I’ve wondered, as the
large, wet billows thundered,
Why you poor land-lubbers moulder in
your offices and stores
When you might be up and doing, rigging
tops’ls, luffing, chewing,
While an iceberg scrapes your yard-arm
or a rock her keelson scores!
Aren’t you yearning for a blizzard? Don’t
you want to pass the Lizard,
Or to feel her reel and stagger as her

Or to know the joy terrific of a blow in the

W 7 hen the hapless rats are swimming

Danger? Who would prate of danger to the

Him as knows the pubs in Rio, in Nanking

(Though, of course, there’s no denying that
at times the life is trying—
What with mumps and corns and chil-

But the salty air is blowing, and the sea is
ebb-and-flowing,
And the Southern Cross and Pleiades are
winking side by side;
So wrn’ll run our easting downwards as we
steer her London Town-wards,
Till we drop the pick some morning in
the Yan Yean’s silver tide!
Then it’s yo-ho-ho, abaft there! Put your
new portmanteau aft there;
Push your suitcase in the cabin, for we’re
off by Callao!
Hark, the Solandcrs are calling, and the
Forty-fives are brawling —
But it’s music to us shell-backs!.... Serve
the rum an’.. . .let ’er go!

On Our Selection.
Starting a Garden —Dad and the Duke.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT had rained hard all through the night,
and in the morning the selection and
the whole wide bush around were
dripping wet. That was why Dad decided
to start the vegetable garden he had been
thinking of so long.
"Well, if you’re ready, look sharp, the
two o’ you, and come along,” he said, address-
ing Dave and Joe, after breakfast. "And
we'll split some o’ them lorgs that’s lyin’
up there into palin’s. Might as well do
that as let ’em get burnt in th’ first fire
that comes along.”
Mother and Sarah couldn't finish their
breakfast, so overjoyed were they at Dad's
announcement. Like the Government with
its branch railways Dad had promised that
garden to them for Heaven knows how many
years. Lest he might go cold on it again
they assured him they only wanted it fenced
—nothing else. All the digging and weeding
and watering they would do themselves. They
didn't want to impose on him at all. They
knew how busy he was always kept, looking
after the main chance, and attending to every-
thing about the place. They told him, too,
that they'd be able to keep the house in vege-
tables, which would be more than half out-
living.
“Jusso,” Dad approved, giving his belt a
tug. “And you’ll have to keep the dam’
fowls out of it, too!”
Then Dave and Joe pressed their slouch
hats on tight, nulled up their pants, and
intimated that they would go and collect
the saw and the axe. They knew where the
saw and the axe were to be found, but the
maul and the wedges they were not sure of.
Resides, the latter were heavier and more
awkward to hump, so they left them to Dad.
"In tli’ barn in a bag 1 think th’ wedges is,
or they was,” Dave shuttled when Dad put
the question to him. That’s where they
should have been, but in his heart Dave had
an idea they were down tin- paddock some-
where, though he didn’t tell Dad. Dad was
a hard man to tell anything like that to.
It was always better to let him find such
things out &>r himself. If Dave had told
him they weren’t in the barn but down the
paddock somewhere, to save him the bother
of hunting for them, he would have wanted
to know why they weren't in the barn, and
then would have sworn at Dave. When l )ad
swore at you in front of everyone you felt
it. And Dave had a lot of feeling.
“Just leave the things till we come in
again,” Mother said—and she and Sarah
went out to select a site for the vegetable
garden. They favored a patch at the side of
the house where there were no big trees
growing, and stepped it twenty yards by
twelve; and when they had driven clothcs’-
pegs into the ground to mark the lines and
gate posts, they stood by, contemplating it
profoundly.
While Dave and Joe collected the saw and
the axe and returned cheerfully with them,
Dad made a great disturbance in the barn.
He threw things about, sent mice racing
everywhere, alarmed an owl out of its sleep
on the beam, and aimed heavy kicks at broody
hens that fearlessly attacked him for pulling
sacks from under them that they were trying
to hatch chickens on without eggs.
Mother and Sarah, having visualised foot-
paths and plots of flourishing parsley and
thyme and stuff, readjusted the pegs.
Dave, on hearing the disturbance in the
barn, became restless. “Cut down to th’
gully, Joe,” lie suggested, “and see if them
wedges was left at th’ tree that was split
for posts near tli’ waterliole.”
“No-n-no, you go, D-D-Dave,” Joe argued
softly; “I brought the kuk-kuk-cows in he
meself this m-m-mornin’.” And he sat down
beside the axe.
“But you didn’t milk them, though,” Dave
reminded him—“and they was all at th’ yard
when y’ brought them.”
“They kuk-kuk-could have been all over
the p-p-paddock, though”; and Joe stroked
the flat of the axe with his hand.
"That was nothing—and it won’t take
f a minute to cut down the gnlly,” Dave
pleaded. “Go on, or he’ll be kickin’ up a
dooce of a shine if he don’t find them in th’
barn.”
"They ain’t in th’ b-b-barn,” Joe confessed
—“nor down th' gug-gug-gully, neither.”
“Cripes, do y’ know where they are and
didn't tell him?” Dave looked alarmed.
“You go up to th’ b-b-big ironbark tree,
D-D-Dave, the one that D-D-Dan and Old
1 nelp was gug-gug-going to cut down, but
d-d -didn't, and you'll g-g-get them there.”
They were interrupted. “There’s the mail-
man stopped, bo-s,” Sarah called from the
garden site; “lie's got something for us.”
Dave and Joe looked up. “He's early,”
they said; then both rushed across to the
fence. They always welcomed the mailman,
whom they greeted as Neddy.
"Look out for your head,” Neddy called,
and shied the newspaper at Joe, then started
yarning with Dave. He told Dave where the
rain had fallen heaviest —that the water was
still running strong round Ryan’s corner
where it was up to the horse’s belly. "Look
at all the mud on him yet”—and he turned
the animal round for inspection.
“Gripes!” Dave said.
Meantime, Joe was squinting curiously
between the folds of the newspaper, trying
to read it without breaking the wrapper.
One of Dad’s commandments was that the
rag was never to be opened by any hand
other than his, and by all of us the com-
mandment was religiously kept, except when
Dad was in town on the jury and hadn't
come home when the court was over. Then
Mother would open it to see if there was
any news of him.
“There’s a lot o’ photers o’ th’ Juke and
Jukess in it, Joe,” the mailman said, with
gleams of loyalty in his eye.
“Gripes, is there!” And Dave jumped
round.
“Yairs, a lot —you can see them landin’
in Sydney from a gun-ship, and all th’ Parlia-
ment chaps, and th’ Lord Mayor with a
chain made o’ gold as long as a dorg-chain
coiled round him like a di’mond snake.”
“Gripes!” Dave repeated. “Let us see th’
gun-ship. Open it, Joe.”
“All of th’m at th’ siding,” the mailman
added, “was rusliin’ the papers soon as th’
train come in. Tli’ place where they landed
it says is ’istoric.”
“Gripes!” Go on, open it —quick, Joe!”
eagerly from Dave.
“Open it your-s -self, D-D-Dave,” and Joe
offered the paper to him.
“But you got it in your hand.” Dave
stepped back to get out of touch. “Go on
—it’s not hard to do. It don’t want two of
us.”
Joe glanced round for signs of Dad.
“There he is—goin’ off down the gully,”
encouragingly from Dave. “What are y’
fritent of? “ Cripes /” and Dave wagged his
head valiantly.
Joe still hesitated.
“It wasn’t opened when y’ got it from
me —don’t forget that, lads.” And flicking
liis mud-bespattered mount with the bridle
reins the mailman rode off. The mailman
himself hadn't forgotten what Dad said when
he spoke to him one day about the paper
being opened. No one ever forgot Dad when
he spoke to them about anything. Dad had
a way of speaking that impressed itself on
everyone.
“There’s no harm in openin’ it to see
the Juke,” Dave urged. “Go on!”
With a rip and tear Joe suddenly and
decisively broke the wrapper. Then lie
paused, and grinned guiltily.
“By cripes, you’ve done it!” Dave gasped
as though he had witnessed a murder.
Slowly Joe unfolded the sheet. Dave drew
closer, and as the contents were revealed
both bent over, and all thoughts of the wrath
to come for having broken Dad’s command-
ments vanished like mist from the moun-
tains.
“Fif-fif-fifty thousand gr-gr-greet Roy-
alty !” Joe stuttered excitedly.
“Gripes!” Dave said, and in his eagerness
nearly tore the sheet.
“Keep your head out o’ th' 1-1-light,
D-D-Dave!” Joe protested.
“What is there in the paper, boys—have
you opened it?” Sarah, attracted by their
excitement, called.
“Th’ J-J-J-Juke!” Joe shouted back.
Then to Dave : “Come and show it to them.”
and without waiting for the other to release
liis grip Joe rushed off with the news. There
was another rip and a tear and more than
half the rag remained with Dave! But the
Duke and the Duchess were pretty equally-
divided. Joe had the head and shoulders
of them and half the sword, while Dave
retained all the rest.
“By cripes, you’re a beaut!” Dave choked.
“Look what you’ve gone and done to it!”
Had a noose been placed round Joe’s neck
to hang him by he couldn’t have looked more
surprised and distressed.
“It w-w-wasn’t my f-f-fault,” he claimed,
well-nigh in tears. “You h-lield on to it.”
“Holy! Here!” Dave handed him liis
half. “You opened it; it’s your affair.”
Glancing round he saw Dad heading back
empty-handed from the gully and looking
like an approaching thunderstorm.
“tripes! I'm off!” And away Dave
ambled, leaving Joe to see it out.
Mother and Sarah, getting impatient,
crossed the yard.
“You’ve got it opened!” Sarah said in
surprise. “Who did it?” Mother, pull-
ing a pitiful face, reminded Joe that his
father would kill him.
“D-D-Dave and m-me opened it to see
th’ J-J-Juke and th’ J-J-Jukess,” Joe
answered, “and D-D-Dave tore it. But it
c-can easy be m-mended.”
“My goodness!” Mother frowned, taking
the print and putting the torn edges to-
gether.
Sarah’s eye took in the forms of the
Duke and Duchess. She nearly fainted.
“Oh, look at them!” she cried. Aren t
they beautiful—Oh, Mother!”
“He’s only a y-y-young b-b-bloke, t-t-too,
Joe ventured.
Mother stared, speechless.
“Bring it inside and put it on the table
so as we can see them better, Mother,”
Sarah suggested.
“Y'-yes, bring it in, Mother,” Joe quickly
agreed. Joe was getting confident again.
Meantime, Dad was coming nearer and
nearer and looking more and more like a
hailstorm.
Mother, carefully carrying the print, led
the way in. Sarah helped adjust it on the
table, and all three hung over it.
Joe laughed: “L-L-Look at th’ bloke down
here with w-w-woman’s clothes on!” But
Mother and Sarah were studying the
Duchess.
“She’s lovely, isn't she!” the former
sighed.
“What a beautiful hat and beautiful shoes
they must be that she has on !”- —this from
Sarah.
“Here’s a 1-lot more of the J-J-Juke,” Joe
discovered, smearing the bottom of the page
with black soil off his finger.
“Don’t dirty it, boy,” and Mother shoved
him aside.
“ ‘The Duchess smiles,’ ” Sarah read out.
“Th’ J-J-Juke don’t,” .Toe put in. He’s
s-s-s-sollum as S-Sandy was when he got
m-m-married.”
“But isn’t she like Kate in this one!”
Sarah enthused. “See, when she smiles.”
Mother saw, and agreed with Sarah.
“ ‘The Duke shakes hands’,” Sarah read
further down the page.
“B-But see th’ b-b-big f-f-fat, bloke he’s
sh-sli-shakin’ hands with,” Joe laughed.
The doorway was suddenly darkened. The
thunderstorm had arrived.
“ Where’s Dave?” Dad roared, glaring
about the room.
Joe, leaning over the table, squeezed closer
to Mother, but didn’t turn his head. He
lowered it nearer the paper, and his interest
in the Duke became more intense. Somehow
Mother and Sarah didn’t seem so much con-
cerned about Dad as they would have been
any other time.
“ Where's Dave?” he roared again.
“Never mind him, Murty: come and see
wliat’s here.” And Mother turned a face to
Dad that was wreathed in smiles.
“Here’s photos, of the Duke and Duchess
in the paper, Dad,” Sarah added —“come and
see them.” And she made room for him
between herself and Joe.
Joe, quivering and wriggling like the
severed tail of a lizard, squeezed still closer
to Mother, while his hands, seeking that
part of his anatomy most exposed to Dad’s
big boot, strove to cover it.
Dad saw the paper. “Whaht!” he ex-,
claimed. “Has some o’ them opened it
again ?”
Joe shook more, while his fingers seemed
to be playing a tune on the back of him-
self.
“I opened it for them,” Mother lied
graciously, “and it got torn a little; but
we can fix it with a little paste as good as
ever for you, father.”
“Fifty thousand greeted them, Dad,” Sarah
enthused, pointing to the sheet —“ ‘cheering
throngs,’ it says.”
Dad's angry look didn't relax. Joe seemed
to be getting St. Vitus’s dance.
“Look at them, man,” Mother insisted.
“You never saw such a young fellow for a
Duke. He’s only a boy.”
Then Dad spoke; and drawing nearer the
table looked over Joe’s head. “Of course
lie’s only a boy,” lie growled. “All Jukes
are only boys, at first, woman.”
“But look at the Duchess, Dad,” Sarah
spoke in her happiest voice. “Me and
mother thinks she's just like l Kate.”
Dad leaned right over Joe. breathed
heavily on the print, and looked long at the
pictures. Joe, always an opportunist, sunk
softly and silently down at Dad’s feet and,
crouching beneath the table, came up on
the other side like a black diver.
“Well —somethin’,” Dad decided slowly,
shaking his head. “But she ain’t the woman
Kate is.”
“An’ who's th’ J-J-Juke like, D-Dad?”
Joe asked, full of bravery again now that the
table was between them.
“Well, he ain’t like you, anyway,” Dad
answered, and put everyone in the best
humor, even Joe himself.
“I n-n-know that,” Joe chuckled. “He ain't
s-s-so good 1-1-1-lookin’, that’s why.”
“What is that you say—you had fellow?”
Mother quickly rebuked; and Sarah said:
“fasten to him comparing himself to the
Duke!”
Dad lifted his head and stared over the
table at Joe. “Don’t you let me hear any
unloyal talk, young man,” he warned, “less
•pah wfjnt yourself and all of us to be sent to
China!”
Just then Dave looked cautiously in at the
door. Dad caught sight of him. “Here,
Dave!” he called. “Come on in an’ see the
photer of the Juke —see him at th’ landin’.”
“Y-Yes, come on D-D-Dave,” Joe joined
in. “Here y’ are,” and Dad with his big
hard finger pointed proudly to the paper.
“Your Mother’s torn them a bit, she was
in such a hurry to see them,” and he patted
Mother forgivingly on the shoulder.
Dave grinning more, and keeping his eyes
off Joe, came right in and hung over the
table with the others.
"Y-Y-Yes,” .Toe confirmed brazenly,
"M-M-Mother tore th’ J-J-Juke clean in two,
D-D-Dave.”
Dave lowered his head and kept silent;
but Sarah tittered.
“Gripes!” Dave said, after examining the
picture. “He looks a Duke, all right, don’t
he?”
Mother sighed in agreement.
"And s-s-so does th' J-J-Jukess,” from Joe.
“But who’s this cove here?” Dave asked.
“What cove?” from Dad.
Dave pointed with his muddy finger.
“The Labor Lord Mayor,” Sarah informed
him.
“Gripes!” Dave grinned. “What sort ’o
clothes has he got on?”
“Oh, him !” Dad grunted, “he’s no one. But
put th’ Juke up in th’ bedroom when you've
mended him, Mother, along wi’ his brother
what was out here, an’ where we can see
him when we wake up in th’ mornin’, but
not over a crack where th' mice can get
under him.”
Then Joe changed the subject. “D-D-Dad,
did y’ fuf-fuf-find th’ maul and w-w-wedges?”
he asked.
Suddenly Dad woke up to realities again,
and, straightening up, stared down hard at
Dave. For a moment it seemed as if the
harmony of the home was going to be dis-
turbed. But Dave came to his own rescue.
“Oh, I got them outside waitin’ for you,”
he said. “Dan and old Uncle left them up
there, and th’ grass was grown over them.”
Dad swallowed a big lump that was rising
in liis throat, and softened again.
“Oh, well,” he said, “we better go an’ do
somethin’. No good wastin time here all
day if you’ve found them.”
Then the three of them went off and made
a start on the palings.

Sea Dreams.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE ships pass down the waters
To unseen lands afar,
With foam-light on their quarters.
And at each mast a star;
The moon-roads lead them onward,
And when the blue night pales,
The dawn-gleam guides them sunward
With soft lights on their rails.
Each day comes new and splendid
The wanderer’s soul to thrill,
Whose joy is never ended
Until his heart is still.
Within the harbor's shadows
The landsman sleeps and dreams
Of mountain-sides and meadows,
xVnd lakes and laughing streams,
And earth-lights sweetly tender ;
But bolder lights are these
Which touch with pearly splendor
The bine dreams of the seas—■
The dreams which always alter
And yet are still the same
To those who never falter,
Pursuing Fancy's flame.
The far-set, flashing coast lights,
Each like a quivering star,
Seem spectral as the ghost lights
In spirit lands afar,
When on the smooth hull glitters,
In spray-gems green and white,
The tumbling foam that litters
Her pathway through the night—
The ship-lights, glowing warm lights,
In flooding silver shine
To challenge gloom and storm-lights
And thrill the heart like wine.
Oh, ship lamps ever speeding!
Oh, star-beams stooping low
kiss the waters bleeding
That mark the way we go!
Oh, saffron glow of morning
And lights of midnight warm
When lightning flashes warning
And thunder leads the storm!
The landsman’s dreams are only
Of glades where he would be —
Elusive, brave and lonely
The blue dreams of the sea!

“TO-MORROW”
It is not with To-day that the Man on the Land is chiefly concerned, but
with To-morrow. It is for next season and for the years to come that he must
plan—To-day. It is not upon the problems of To-day that the board of business
men deliberates. To-day’s problems were, or should have been, solved Yesterday,
and To-day’s work is to plan and build for To-morrow.
How many of us apply this principle to business, but fail to apply it to our-
selves, yet our own future needs are more vital to us than anything else.
In business we plan for the years to come, and establish reserves for further
contingencies. In private life so many of us are content to drift along without
plan and without reserving our own personal monies.
Not only Wise Saving, but Wise Spending will be a factor in your personal
success. To either, a Banking Account is nowadays almost essential.
For a start open a Savings Account. It will cost you nothing, but will
help you to plan for —TO-MORROW.

Thos. A. Edison, 364 Iverit-street, Sydney.
Several times lately I have fitted new tyres
and tubes and have found when attending to
puncture that the tube has pulled hi halves,
in most cases near the valve. Whaffor? I
make it a practice to clean rust from inside
of rim, rub with emery paper and apply alu-
minium paint to prevent rust—has this any-
thing to do with the trouble?—No. 137.
Probably your tyres are creeping, through
the rims being overpolished and the fact of
the tube not being able to creep, being secured
to the rim with the valve. This may be
causing the tube to tear at the point of
greatest strain, viz., near the valve.
Can Williams Bros., Ltd., reduce the
security that was originally available for the
preference capital? —No. 90.
Unless there is a provision to the con-
trary (and this department has never seen
one), a co. can mortgage its assets or issue

ries,” by Lulu Hunt Peters (3s. 6d.) ; Angus
and Robertson.
Is there any other body in Australia like
the Australian Literary Society of Melbourne,
which deals solely with works of Australian
authors and seeks to encourage them? —
No. 126.
There is the Queensland Authors and
Artists’ Society, c/o Mrs. M. Forrest, 41
Telegraph Chambers, Queen-street, Brisbane.
If there are any others we shall be glad to
hear of them.
What's the origin of the term “Curse of
Scotland” as applied to the nine of diamonds?
—No. 125.
The popularly accepted explanation is that
during the battle of Culloden the Duke of
Cumberland wrote an order on the back of
the nine of diamonds commanding his troops
not to give quarter to the fleeing forces of the
Pretender.
I think Eve got a photo-play. To whom
can I write about it? —No. 124.
E. J. Carroll, 20 Martin-place, Sydney;
Raymond Longford, Ward-street, Roseville,
N.S.W.
Where can I find set out the Rules of
Debate?—No. 91.
Either “The Labor Chairman and Guide
to the Method of Conducting Meetings,” by
Walter M. Citrine (3s. 6d.) ; or “Chairman
and Debater’s Handbook,” by D. M. Ran-
som (Routledge’s Miniature Library, Is.
9d.).
Names and addresses of a large new and
second-hand bookseller in London and New
York. —No. OS.

Court, London, E.C.4; Brentano's, stli-

Where could I procure a copy of “Logier’s
System and Science of Music”? Name some
other books dealing with the same subject.
—No. 52.
(1) Logier’s “System and Science of
Music” is unobtainable. (2) “Foundation
of Practical Harmony and Counterpoint, by
R. O. Morris (Angus and Robertson), 10s.;
also books by two Australians —Joseph Brad-
ley’s “Theory of Music” and Alfred Hill’s
“Melody and Harmony.”
What can I study in order to become a
good dehater and public speaker? —No. 92.
Improve your general education and especi-
ally English; keep in touch with current
happenings, and study either “Speak Out,”
by Alex. Watson (3s. 6d.), or “Speaking in
Public,” by Charles Seymour (ss. 6d.).
Do you consider shares in Tongkah Har-
bor at present prices a sound investment?
Are they likely to advance? —No. 89.
Everything depends on the risks you are
prepared to take. Tin averaged £IBB in
1911; it is more than £IOO above that now.
So you’ve got the risk of a very uncertain
market —certainly with good prospects. And
you’ve got mining risks, less with dredging
than some forms, but considerable neverthe-
less. And you’ve got the fact that every
pound taken out of a mine leaves a pound
less to take out. Tongkah Harbor has made
many people rich; it may make many others
rich. But the chances are that, as with
nearly every mine, somebody will be pinched
in the end.
(./) Is there any duty on ferro-manganese?
(2) Is any imported? (3)lf so, why? —No.
168.
(1) Customs Department says that ferro-
manganese is “free-unspecified.” (2) Yes, a
little, apparently from Belgium. (3) Presum-
ably because it is cheaper than the unpro-
tected local product.

“Red for our soldiers brave,
Blue for our sailors true,
White for our name, of spotless
Fame — Red, White and Blue.”

I want the formula of the solution for
petrifying plants, insects, etc. —No. 140.
I want information about oil burners, for
attaching to either Cornish or Stirling boilers,
to replace either wood or coal fuel. Are they
more economical than the last-mentioned
fuels?- —No. 152.
Tell me a cure or check for the apple root-
borer. Will the borers live in wet ground? —
No. 149.
A recipe for dressing a white twill duck
launch cover to make it rainproof. —No. 120.
How can I preserve celluloid in motor-car
side-screens? —No. 111.
Daily I kill white ants (large) in thou-
sands. Is there anything that will keep them
away? Have tried raw sheep dip and
arsenic. —No. 144.
The best route to travel with a waggon
team from Warialda (N.S.W. ) to Miles or
Dalby (Q.), former preferred. —No. 150.
Information Supplied.
No. 20. —Information was sought about cur-
ing lemons for sale in summer. Reports of tests
will be found in the N.S.W. Agbiculterai
Gazette, October, ’24, and Sept., ’25. The
principal points are: (1) Avoid damage in
gathering; (2) sever —Wiss’s clippers are
recommended —in two cuts, one to get the
fruit from the tree, the other to clip the twig
close to the fruit; (3) don’t let the fruit get
tree-ripe (it is best to show just a trace of
color) ; (4) wear a cotton glove to handle
the fruit; (5) pack straight into the cases;
(6) to avoid damage to the tender rind, hold
the cases at the orchard up to seven days to
toughen the fruit; (7) use paper-lined
cases ; (8) fairly low temperature and high
humidity are necessary in the storage-room
—dry winds that reach the fruit are fatal.
I suggest dipping a portion of the crop in a
10 p.c. solution of boracic at llOdeg. Fahr.
before storing, for the control of blue-mould.
—W.B.S.
No. 20.—The best way to circumvent the
lady bot-fly is to singe the eggs off the hairs
with a taper and keep the long hairs on the
jaws, breast and forelegs trimmed close. To
clear any bots from the prad’s stomach fast
him for at least 12 hours, then give him a
draught composed of one pint linseed oil with
2oz. turpentine thoroughly mixed with it. If
you have no drenching bit give it with a Deer
bottle. Before pouring it down his throat
touch the roof of the horse’s mouth with the
neck of the bottle. This makes him instinc-
tively close his windpipe and prevents acci-
dents. Don’t work the horse for at least 24
hours after the draught. Another remedy is
to give once a day for three days one drachm
of sulphate of copper, and follow at the end
of the time with four drachms of Barbadocs
aloes. Repeat, at the end of the week if
necessary.—Two Seas.
No. 26. —If the Digger farmer whose horses
are worried by bot-flies plasters any old waste
oil (castor preferable) under the animal's
jaws, and about the under neck, chest and
forelegs, he will find that the bots will give
little trouble. Crank-case oil will do at a
pinch and can be procured for little or
nothing at most garages.—.Tim Grahame.
No. 32. —The evil condition of the barrel is
caused by corrosion, through not being
cleaned after use; if very bad, the
barrel will have to be re-bored. The
expense of re-boring is too high for
cheap rifles, and it is better to buy
a new one and treat it carefully. The
following method of cleaning is practised by
British sportsmen, who pay high prices for
their rifles and take great care of them:
Saturate a clean rag in Rangoon oil (sold
by gunsmiths) or in neatsfoot oil, which is
just as good. Attach the rag to a wooden
rod, and clean the barrel thoroughly: a steel
rod is apt to injure the surface of the barrel.
If the rifle is not in constant use, put it
away for four or five days, and repeat the
cleaning process, using a clean oily rag as
often as one grows dirty. Leave the barrel
oily, and put the rifle away until wanted,
when again run a rag through it. Sometimes
it is helpful to fire a round or two between
the cleanings when trying to restore a very
dirty barrel. Vinegar is not a safe cleanser,
on account of its acid nature; the use of
quicksilver is unknown to the writer, who
has been familiar with rifles for 30 years.—
Max.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
First in the A.J.C. St. Leger, second in
the Sydney Cup, first in the Cumberland
Stakes and first in the A.J.C. Plate was
Windbag’s record in the autumn of 1925,
and Limerick equalled it at the late Rand-
wick round, thereby winning £6961 in stake-
money for 11. A. Knight, who no doubt
divided 20 p.c. or more between trainer
Jones and jockey McCarten. The Maoriland
three-year-old, greatly improved in appear-
ance since the spring and no longer troubled
with the ailment which baffled Jones then,
proved himself a liigh-class horse, one that
can go fast for a mile and stay two miles
or more; but he is not the equal of Windbag
at the same age. He had no Spearfelt to
heat in the St. Leger, and, as for his w.f.a.
opponents, Pantheon was not quite at his
best, Heroic and Count Cavour were very
much below par and Valamita is scarcely
in the w.f.a. class —though he might have
been had his owner handed him over to a
representative trainer instead of trying to
train the horse himself in the intervals of
running a restaurant, As regards the Cup,
Windbag nearly came down in his race,
wherein a bad accident occurred, and then
finished a close second to Lilypond. Limerick
was always in a good position—had every
chance, in fact —but was fairly and squarely
beaten by a better horse at the weights on
the day.
Piastoon did not appear after the second
day; he will probably go north in quest of
another Brisbane Cup, to which £4OOO is to be
added this year. Some of the Sydney scribes
proclaimed his Cup victory a fluke ;. tlie A.J.C.
liandicapper, on the other hand, gave him
list. 121 b. in the Final Handicap, with a
7st. minimum, rating him 121 b. better than
I toaster (who halved the Epsom with Mctel-
lus), 261 b. better than Mountain Prince, the
ultimate winner, and 361 b. better than Lucy
Thrice. So the official is obviously certain
it was no fluke. On the strength of Pias-
toon’s spring defeats it was hastily decided
that he was of little account. Insufficient
allowance was made for the fact that lie
was asked to do a tremendous amount of
galloping for a young horse. Put into work
in the summer, he was raced at Brisbane
in April, May, June and August, at Sydney
in October and at Melbourne in November,
his excessive programme including two races
at 2 miles, two at If mile, a St. Leger
(If mile 132 yards), one at 1 mile 5 fur-
longs, three at 1-1 mile and two at If mile.
Yet he is such a hardy customer that, after
the short spell which W. Kelso gave him
when he was transferred to that Sydney
trainer’s stable, he ran two good seconds,
at Randwick in January—to Solomon in
the A.J.C. Holiday Handicap, 10 furlongs,
and to Bacchus in the Anniversary Handi-
cap, 12 furlongs—though he couldn’t pos-
sibly have been in good shape.
Prior to the Sydney Cup Piastoon finished
fourth at Rosehill in a mile race, first (with
North Logan) in another mile at the same
course, second (to Luddenham) in the War-
wick Farm Cup, 12 furlongs, and fourth in
the A.J.C. Autumn Stakes, wherein he
stumbled at the crisis after holding Heroic
for something like half a furlong. A praise-
worthy record, surely, yet the experts
wouldn’t have him ; said he “wouldn’t stay.”
In the Warwick Farm Cup he made all the
running and was beaten a neck in 2min.
31sec. Rawhetu tried to wrest the lead from
him, but failed and fell back; then Ludden-
ham challenged and, favored by his light
weight, finally prevailed, though the Queens-
lander battled out every inch. To be tackled
twice in a race so run is a very severe test
of a horse’s stamina and gameness; it was
in such a way that Carbine was once defeated
by an animal not in his class, in the City
Handicap, 13 furlongs, on the third day of
the round Rawhetu ran right away from a
field which included third and fourth horses
in the Cup, and he nearly did the same thing
in the Dangar Handicap, 12 furlongs, on the
last day, beating everything but Bacchus.
No. Limerick wasn't unlucky to lose the Cup.
Piastre’s son is as good as he looks. And
lie is so good-looking and so stoutly bred that
he is pretty sure to succeed at the stud, if
given opportunities with first-class mares.
Unfortunately, those are opportunities which
Australian-bred sires seldom get.
With Beckwith and Chromium tempo-
rarily out of the business, Greenline short
of a gallop or two and Glenariff and Black
Duchess floundering in the heavy going, the
N. S. Wales two-year-olds offered a feeble
resistance to the Victorian contingent. With
a 101 b. advantage Gannon defeated Royal
Feast in the Champagne Stakes, but the
big son of King Offa —Bunfeast is built and
bred more like a Derby colt; Cannon’s sire,
St. Anton, hasn't sired a stayer yet. Vaals's
brother Bion proved a dreadful disappoint-
ment to Moss, who had an exceptionally
bad meeting. Perhaps the most formidable
opposition to Royal Feast in the spring will
come from Maoriland.
With Heroic running his last race and
Fuji San trying to win a six-furlong sprint
with 10st. 121 b., the City Tattersall’s Club
had special attractions to offer at Raudwick
on Saturday; and its bookmaking' members
THE FIRST OF HIS KIND
DISSATISFIED FORWARD (to referee at end of game): "How th’ blazes d' you get along

added to their substantial gains on three,
at least, of the four A.J.C, days. Fuji San,
favorite at 7 to 2, made a gallant effort
but failed to concede 441 b. to Quan Tart
(5 to 1), though he could have beaten every-
thing else had Pike ridden him out; Bravery
(7 to 1), sneaking up on the rails, broke
even with him. The other son of Valais,
however, ran shockingly in the City Tatter-
sail’s Cup, for which a confiding multitude
backed him at 5 to 1 : Donald (10 to 1) ,
improving greatly for Toohfey on his exhibi-
tion, with an apprentice aboard, in the
A.J.C. Final Handicap, won very easily
from Royal Sun (12 to 1) and consistent
Cool gong (14 to 1). Coolgong has been
second, third, first, second and third in five
starts.......
IV. Kelso had a nice win with a Demos-
thenes two-year-old called Statesman, who
was backed from tens to half thal price,
but the stable didn’t collect nearly as much
as has been alleged. James Wilson landed
a double with his Burrabadeen colt Mutcha
(16 to 1) and Perspective (7 to 1); the
pair could have been bought for a thousand
or so a couple of days before, but buyers
were bashful. And A..T.0. members were
glad to see chairman Stephen’s colors carried
to the fore in a Novice Handicap by Knight
of the Garter (14 to 1). By imported Sir
Dighton out of Silk Stocking, dam of the
late MilJieme and the one-eyed Hosier, this
colt is the makings of a good horse.
Duet looked pretty well at Raudwick, and
may be ready for her half-yearly win at
Warwick Farm next Saturday—she is en-
gaged in the May Handicap. 10 furlongs
(7st. minimum), with 7st. 101 b., and it is
not much of a field. Dion (7st. 131 b.) may
be next best. Somnolent (9st.) or Bacagi
(Bst. 91b.) may take the Intermediate Han-
dicap, one mile, and Valparaiso (7st. 81b.)
or Chris (Sst. 31b.) the Gasula Handicap,
seven furlongs.
Fields were small at Caulfield on Saturday
and punters had visions of a good day. The
visions proved mirages. Bombard, who had
Bob Lewis’s assistance, was supposed to be
a moral for the Glenhuntly Handicap, 11
furlongs, and McShortoddS was astonished
at his own magnanimity when he offered
twos. But the horse that had run so well
at Flemington was last at the mile post, still
last at the six furlongs, and nearer last
than first at the finish. On the other hand,
Heroic’s brother Thracian, backed by the
stable from 6 to 1 to 9 to 2, ran past the
pacemaking Spearset (6 to 1) in the straight
and went on to win quite easily by a length
and a quarter from Eridanus (9 to 2), who,
as usual, finished well; Spearset was a fair
third. It was Thracian’s first success, and
his patient owner, A. T. Greswick, was
congratulated after the race, as also was
J. Pengilly, the trainer. Duncan was on
top, and the time was 2min. 21see. Thracian
ran wretchedly in the St. Legcr at Raudwick,
but evidently the going did not suit him.
Sacedon (2 to 1) was favorite for the
Katandra Two-year-old, seven furlongs, but
nothing had a chance with the topweight
Byron (4 to 1), who led all the way. Trainer
Bill Burke aud owners 11. and M. Burke
have done well with this Cyllene More —Dur-
illa gelding, who is evidently a hardy as well
as a speedy sort. There was backing for
nearly everything in the Brighton Handicap,
six furlongs, Menander, recently in Sydney,
finishing up favorite at 4 to 1. "But Fisher’s
gelding was never in the hunt; E. M.
Pearce’s slick mare Lady Thrill (6 to 1)
winning a great race by half a head from the
ex-Maorilander Tea Bell (5 to 1)» who was
his own head in front of Sydney s out
acquaintance Translator (8 to 1). The race
was run in lmin. 11l see., a record for Caul-

The pleasant news that she has won
another £lOOO handicap with her Two-—! .any
Vincent mare Triangle has been cabled to
Mrs. Villeneuve Smith, of Adelaide, who is
now abroad. In the Port Adelaide club s
Christmas Handicap, Triangle romped horn -
from Itedaere and Biskra, running
furlongs in lmin. 191 sec. Raised from *st.
41b. to Bst. 101 b. for the Goodwood Handicap,
she was generally thought to have, too miicn
weight, but the great crowd at Morphettvillc
on Saturday saw her dance away from a big
field almost as easily as at Cheltenham ; the
Cyklon colt Trey I on. trained by Seobic for A.
T. Craig', was second, and Ron Miki, another
three-year-old and also by Two, was third.
Triangle, who was ridden by 11. W alsh,
returned £9 11s.- —2s. more than after the
Christmas Handicap—on the £1 machine.

nut mare, had a thing of his own, Cockina

In that position they settled one another

heat the tired colt by six lengths, the ex-
hausted filly being nearly the same distance
behind Killara. Cockina, who is a bay

“Retired Urger”: There's a lot of th’ old
snap left in Queensland racin’ outside th

a cove chopped the startin’-gate down night
before th’ races at Broadsound, a waterin’-
pl ace near Rocky, w’ere the skeeters some-
times jostle th’ nags off the course. Seems ’is
boss ’ad a nag that was a shot outer th''
gun with th’ flag, but went sour oil th’
barrier. Broadsound ain’t exactly Flemin’-
ton or Robbo Park either —excep’ in some
perticlers—w’en it comes to equipment. With
th’ startin’-gatc buzzed off, th’ flag ’d be th’
nex’ best card, and that’d mean a stone oti
th’ boss’s rnoKe. A good lurk, but it all
come unglued. They copped th’ cove before
th’ meetin’ opened. Bein’ a ’arf-caste, e
squealed. They’re a sportin’ crowd up that
way, an’ seein’ no one ’ad bin rooked, th
beaks on’y fined th’ cove an’ ’is boss a quid

though. Never trust a ’arf-caste; they got

“Kaffir Market”: The London Stock
Exchange sweep on the Epsom Derby has
been filled at £250,000. It has outrivalled
even the better-known Calcutta Jockey Club's
Derby sweep, though the sale of tickets for
the latter lias been more rigidly circum-
scribed than of yore. The first, prize in the
Stock Exchange concern is £75,000; prizes
on the other placed nags total £90,000, and
drawers' of all nominated horses will divide
£60,000 —there were 300 nominations. Chari-
ties are to get £25,000 —-not much bread with
all that sack. Interest on the big accumula-
tion during the six weeks between the sweep’s
closing and Derby day will more than pay all
expenses.
“Dor Paard”: Not many Australians, and
fewer Englanders, T imagine, can recall
where Dick Wootton got his first start after
leaving Australia's shores. It was in South
Africa, subsequent to the Boer War; Dick s
rise is associated with that of the Germiston
Sporting Club, the first suburban club on the
Rand. Most of Dick’s charges figured on
the Germiston course when he made his
beginnings at Jo’burg. and it was there that
the afterwards world-famous Frank Wootton
rode his first winner. That happened in a
pony race, the mount, Kempsey. being owned
by dad.

M. PELLETIER, 16 Bridge Street, Sydney.
is not to be blamed), box “Sunny” Jim Wil-
liams. one of the aforesaid aliens. Poor
walker got very little out of it when lie had
paid his exes.
Williams fought continually for a knock-
out. but took no chances with a plucky and
dangerous opponent. Had the colored man
stood toe to toe and swapped punches
the Australian would have shown to greater
advantage; but Jim kept on the move, always
breaking ground when Walker tried to force
matters and hitting only when lie had worked
his man into position. He brought his plan
off in the fourth, feinting with the loft and
dropping Walker with a sizzling right to the
jaw. Wally forced liis shaky legs to support
him when Wallis counted nine, and was carry-
ing the fight to the surprised coon at the bell.
This caused Williams to fall back on body-
belting, and he weakened Walker to such an
extent that by the ninth round he had the
tight well in hand. During the minute’s
spell he jumped up and pranced with eager-
ness to be at it again. Walker met his rush
gamely, and they exchanged hard wal-
lops ; then Williams found the chin and the
white boy came heavily to the canvas.
Gamely he got up at nine but was dropped
again, almost before he could get his daddies
up. and here the referee wisely called a halt.
Walker should not be discouraged by Iris
reverse; the pity of it is that the promising
youngster should have had to take on so
wily and hard-punching a veteran in the
process of learning the game. They order
these matters much more sensibly in America.
“8.M.”: .Tack Fuller, well known about
Sydney’s Tattersall’s clubs, was a very fine
boxer in bis prime. He fought a notable
battle with “Ironbark” Jim Burge in 1889 at
Foley’s, and an even more thrilling affair
with “Shadow” Maher in 1890 at the
Amateur Gymnastic Club. Burge had under-
taken to stop Fuller in 15 rounds, and
as Jack was immensely popular the ram-
shackle hall was packed. In the seventh
[’.urge fluked one of Iris right overarm swings,
a glancing blow that bounced off the point,
and Fuller dropped, apparently out. But he
was up at eight, and Burge’s hot pursuit and
gloating “I’ve got you, Jack!” failed to scare
the lad. Jim could never repeat that wallop.
Jack, for his part, pounded the granite face
throughout the remaining rounds and, of
course, was the winner.
Canadian Billy Edwards, who made his
debut at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday
night, is, like his opponent, Billy Meeske, a
wrestler of the allrin type. He proved him-
self a distinguished showman, and when he
resorted to biting the other William people,
prone, to be suspicious had no doubt about
his earnestness. He vociferously invoked the
aid of the small referee when the Australian
retaliated with painful face bars and the
like, but that was ascribed to his showman-
ship. In the sixth round Edwards clapped
on a series of headlocks which made Meeske
so groggy that, after his shoulder had been
pinned, lie lay crumpled on the mat until his
keepers dragged him to his corner. They
worked feverishly to get him into battle
order and succeeded so well that Australian
Rill completely dominated the last two
rounds, but Edwards would not bo downed;
he had a trick of slipping out through the
ropes when in trouble. Edwards the win-
ner. Meeske weighed 51b. more than the
Canadian, who came in at 12st. 91b.
Racquet and Bawl
Nineteen-year-old Jack Crawford is now
senior and junior lawn-tennis champion of
X. S. Wales; and if he trains methodically
and doesn’t overstrain his eyesight by play-
ing under the electrics there will be a Davis
Cup trip for him next year. The lad retained
his junior title by defeating his pal Hopman,
who captured the first set. He had two
opponents, R. O. Cummings (conqueror of
Queenslander Moon) and It. E. Schlesinger,
in the closing stages of the senior singles and
nearly lost his matches against both, but
on each occasion he pulled himself together
and won by dint of grit and headwork. The
final, against Schlesinger, ran to five sets,
scores being 7-5, 1-6. 9-7, 5-7, 6-4. Low
volleys and severe forehand cross-court drives
were Crawford’s principal scoring assets.
The men’s doubles were won by Norman
Peach and A. L. North, who defeated Jim
Willard and Schlesinger—6-2, 8-6, 7-9, 3-6,
6-3. The losers had been playing in _ the
mixed doubles just previously, and wilted
towards the finish; these mixed doubles went
to .Tim Willard and Miss Cox. Esna Boyd,
the Victorian, scored a good win against
Daphne Akhurst in the singles champion-
ship for their sex; in the doubles, however,
Miss Akhurst and Miss Cox beat the Mel-
bourne girl and Mrs. Utz with surprising
ease.
“Cut Shot”As here suggested, Suzanne
Lenglen, who is nothing if not what her
sex calls a “cat,” is to make her first pro-
l'essional appearance in England in Wimble-
don week. She will show at the Phyllis
Court ( lub at Henley from June 29 to July
2, on which latter date the Wimbledon finals
will be played ; and there can be no doubt the
temperamental lady’s appearance will affect
the Wimbledon gates. That is Suzanne’s
object, for she had more than one brush, as
an amateur, with the economical organisa-
tion which controls English lawn-tennis.
Car and Cycle
“Aniraf”: About the worst patch of coun-
try in South Aus. from the motorist’s point
of view is Lake Crossing, or “The Cobbler,”
on the mail route from Farina to Inna-
mincka. Motors have got through, but in
some cases it has taken two days to do
the 30 miles of drifting saud. The Amcs-
bury brothers, who carry the mail from
Farina to Cordillo Downs, via Innamincka,
tried crossing The Cobbler with a Graham
truck, but after breaking a differential and
spring leaves they went back to camels.

“Plugger” : There’s something to be done,
even if you are shot off a two-wlieeler going
ninety an hour. Ted Gilbert, the Zenith
rider, gave a demonstration at Maroubra on
Saturday night, lie was warming up his
mount before the meeting and his back tyre
blew out, so that his machine slithered a
hundred yards and then hit the concrete. He
came off hunched into a ball, rolled along a
bit and pulled up with only a few scratches
on his hands and wrists. In the old bike-
racing days the thing to do was to lie flat,
face down, and put your hands over your
head. If you didn’t the rat-trap pedals of the
rest of the field were apt to cut some nasty
slices out of your cranium.

“Lytt”: Eddie Briuck, the American
motor-cyclist with the sweet, sad smile, goes
back to the land of the wooden nutmeg on
the 2.lst. He is about the most popular visi-
tor who ever struck Maroubra, and has done
a lot to convince riders of the possibilities
of small single,-cylinder mounts. He estab-
lished a sort of lieu over the Silver Helmet,
which lie won for the sixth time at Satur-
day’s meeting, but whether he has won or
lost he has alwavs smiled, and always proved
himself a good sport.
“Lytt”: A pleasant reliability trial is
that which is being undertaken by Violette
Cordery, an English girl who arrived in
Sydney on Monday after touring from Port
Augusta (S.A.). Her task is to drive a 19
h.p. Invicta (British) car over portions of
Europe, the Empire and the United States,
and she does it in style, taking along a
mechanic and an It.A.C. observer. The
Invicta is a fairly heavy job, with a 6-
cylinder motor and 11-inch ground clear-
ance, and it ought to be able to buck any
sort of country. Miss Cordery put it on a
train to cover the stretch from Kalgoorlie
WHEN THE HORSE HELPED.

smash happened. You didn’t hear of all
these accidents in the good old horse-and-
buggy days.”

to Port Augusta ; however, that was scheduled
before she left Britain. After seeing the
Pacific Coast of America and doing the over-
land journey from coast to coast along the
Canadian border she will go back to Blighty
in a ship. Violette won her motoring laurels
ou Montlhery speedway in France, where
she broke some women-drivers’ records.

“Bowser”: “Garry” (B. 24/4/’27) asks
how much income is needed to run a car.
All depends on how heavy it is aud how'
far you run. Accounts kept by my firm
show that a car that did 24 miles to the
gallon and ran 45,000 miles a year cost a
shade over £3 a week for all running
expenses and £5 a w'eek when allowance
was made for interest and depreciation. But
my neighbor, who does about 400 miles a
week in a second-hand light car, finds it
costs him a shade under £4 a week. I know
family men earning £6 and £7 a week who
have‘bought new cars on t.p., and they
IN THE ROUGH.
Diggle who look up country golf for his own [?]
seem to be getting through comfortably, and
a young bachelor of my acquaintance sports
a roadster on 50s. a week. But I’m afraid
his board is in arrears.
“Kobbi”: It is a dangerous convention
that requires a motorist to dim his lights
when passing another car on the open road.
Recently at Toowoomba (Q.) a lad was
killed by a careful driver who dimmed to
pass; before he could switch on again he
hit his victim, who came suddenly from
behind the other car. In narrow, stumpy,
bush country tracks, the practice is sheer
madness, for it takes some time for the eyes
to adjust themselves to the re-lighted sur-
roundings. Some advocate closing one eye
when switching off, but after having
narrowly escaped accident more than once
by trying to conform to good roadside
manners, I prefer to keep both eyes and
lights full on. If the glare of the approach-
ing car is too great for your optics, then
look slightly to the left.
“Crank”: The automobile seems to have
got about as far as it; can go in its present
form, and experts are already forecasting a
change-over to engines of the Diesel type,
operating on cheap, heavy fuel. Latest de-
signs show an engine working on a two-
cycle, double-acting principle. This delivers
power on the upstroke as well as the down,
giving four cylinders practically the work-
ing equivalent of eight. The development
of power on both sides of the piston thus
means reduction in the size and weight of
the engine—a problem every designer is
chasing.
The Watermen
“Slide": The inter-State eiglit-oared race
for the King’s Cup will be rowed at Hobart
on Saturday. Southern critics are keen on
the form of the N.S.W. crew, which is
notable for uniform body swing and blade
work. The Westralians have also made a
strong impression; they did a couple of
arresting spins over the full course, but have
eased up for the final w T eek. The Tas-
manians, a greatly improved crew, with a
strong lift on the catch and a powerful
drive right through, are favorites, and will
probably fight it out with the Westerners.
“Bob” Pearce, of N. S. Wales, is fancied
for the sculls.
“Leg Drive” :As I write, the first heats
in the Sydney Flappers’ Festival —otherwise
the G.P.S. eight-oar race—are imminent. The
final will be rowed on Saturday, when the
volume of young female squeal will be such
that listeners-in on Mars may write to the
local journals complaining of statics., lor
the race, which serves no great athletic pur-
pose —the youthful oarsmen rarely show up
in serious rowing later —has arrived at the
pitch of attracting ten times as much attention
in Sydney as the inter-State contest for the
King’s Cup or international bouts with Maori-
land. The vogue of the Flapper in Sydney is
responsible. She has got an idea into her head
that attendance at this particular regatta is
the social hallmark of - her caste, and drags
thither her unhappy relatives and acquain-
tances. Ninety per cent, of her doesn’t know
an oar from an icecream spoon, save for the
fact that one is too large to get into her
mouth, and about the same proportion doesn’t
even know a G.P.S. boy well enough to ghid-
eye him. Yet she attends in her thousands.
hung with ribbons, and screeches for nine
youths whom she has never met and never
will. From the rowing point of view, the
function is a farce; from the educational,
with its hard and segregated training, it is
a handicap. The universities arc flying inland
to the secluded Nepean. High time the G.P.S.
took similar action to escape the Flapper.
Footbrawl
naving farewcllcd the little lady with tin-
vf„iKAnvn,>
witching smile, a good part of Melbourne
has settled down to the serious business ot
tile winter—watching and
barracking the footballers.
On Saturday some 25,000
viewed the already well-
trained Collingwood Magpies
down the Gcelongese by 107
points to 84, in a game that
was fast, open and exciting
to the close; ’Wood had the
better system and was
quicker to the ball. Inci-
dentally, Ernie Wilson canpi
down hard and broke his
collar-bone, and Gordon
Coventry started well by
booting eight goals. Mel-
bourne’s Red Legs unfurled
last year’s pennant and
stressed their continued
superiority by collecting 115
points to Richmond’s 65.
Johnson getting nine goals.
North Melbourne, having im-
proved its team by eap-
luring ( linrlie Tyson from 'Wood and Syd.
Barker and Jenkins from Essendon, altered
its last season’s record of no victories by
walloping Fitzroy-—B3 points to 75. South
Melbourne and Carlton, both improved
teams, put up a tremendous scuffle before
33.000 of the laity, the game seesawing
entranciugly until the bell rang, with South
ahead by just one point—7o to 09. Essendon
defeated Footscray with ease and 110 points
to 03; and Hawthorn, somewhat green as
yet, set St. Ivilda a task which it accom-
plished—-St. Hilda, 88 points; Hawthorn,
08.
The third round of the N.S.W. Rugby
League competition on Saturday was chiefly
remarkable for the severe licking given by
South Sydney to Glebe tin the latter’s home
ground at Wentworth Park. Glebe went
down by 31 to 6, the South Sydney for-
wards making light of the big Glebe pack.
Western Suburbs had little trouble in dis-
posing of Newtown by 33 to 11; McMillan,
the full-back, showed brilliantly against
Newtown’s forward rushes. University got
another setback, this time from Eastern
Suburbs, who won by 30 to 13. Three tries
by T. Fitzpatrick and six goals by A.
Oxford, both Eastern forwards, were features
of the game. Balmain, with 12-0 in the
first half, was hard pressed throughout the
second, North Sydney making the scores
12-12 at whistle-time.
Heavy scoring was the rule in the opening-
round of the Union competition, so much so
as to hint at a disinclination to tackle hard.
Tacklers of the back-scratching variety will
be useless in England. A notable exception
was Tom Egan, the former King’s School
centre, who gave a great display of grassing
’em for Eastern Suburbs, which team Rand-
wick beat by 16 to 7. University, again a
good all-round side, scored 34 to S against
Western Suburbs. Glebe-Balmain wrecked
North Sydney, 41 to 9, and Y.M.O.A. shaded
Manly, % 20 to 19. ....
Among the Soccer men, the defeat of
Granville, last year’s premiers, by Balgoxv-
nie, 4 goals to 2, outshone everything else.
Masters, skipper of the winners, again
proved himself a skilful centre-forward.
The Australian-game opening saw East
Sydney, on top last season, account for
Sydney by 71 (9-17) to 64 (9-10).
“Timi”: In preparing for the invasion of
South Africa next year the M.L. Rugby
authorities will do their best to remove a
weakness that caused a lot. of hard thought
during the 1924 tour of Britain. Their idea
is that the All Black forwards who meet the
Springbok on his native veldt should be able
to dribble as well as push and pass. The
art of dribbling has almost been forgotten
since the days of Hardcastle, McKenzie and
Tom Pauling, but here and there a hard-bitten
coach remembers how useful it cau be when
flying wings and dodgy five-eighths fail to
break a tight defence. The deadliest tackier
in the world is powerless against the man
who has learned the secret of ball-control with
each foot. Before they have been a fort-
night in England the N. S. Wales tourists
will see a lot of dribbling. It might pay
them to take a few lessons, in advance.

“Glenelg”: The season upon which the
South Aus. League is entering will be the
longest in the history of that body. It will
run into six months for certain, and a chal-
lenge match may extend it into the seventh
month. It seems a thundering long time to
expect players in such a strenuous game
to keep tit, but Wheat State footballers are
a hardy breed.
* * * *
“S.S." : Old Queensland Rugby Union men
will agree with "Gate” (B. 21/4/’27) that
F. C. Lea was, as sole selector, all that
could be desired; but “late” he is not. Fred,
now over 70. recently retired from the Com-
monwealth Bank and spends most of his
time in Moreton Bay with rod and line. If
Fm any judge, he will do a lot more fishing yet.
* * * =!=
“Past Grammar” : For some time after its
beginnings, Queensland Rugby League made
a valiant effort to maintain a de facto
amateur status, even if it was de jure pro-
fessional. The increase in gates has weak-
ened this laudable aspiration, and most of
the northern Leagues now work on a cash
basis. The chairman of Toowoomba League,
till lately one of the strongest in Queens-
land. told his organisation the other day
that the League’s fading glories would have
to be revived by “buying good outside
players” or it must be prepared to endure
a drab future. The fact that representa-
tive players were also demanding higher fees
than their less talented club mates, to the
great indignation of the latter, was another,
gnawing worm in the bud; and the fear
that, failing higher dividends, the great ones
may depart to other quarters, where genius
is more generously rewarded, lies heavy on
the Downs League.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Scruff": Harry Sinclair, who won the
Australian amateur golf championship in
11125, and turned professional after a visit to,
Britain as an amateur, has been airing his
opinion of British golf to a N.'S.W. inter-
viewer. Sinclair, who got as far as the
fourth round in the British amateur cham-
pionship, thinks that British pros, are better
than their Australian confreres by 2 strokes
at least, but that the Aussie amateur is
superior to the British. It may be so, but
the experiences of Ivo Wliitton and Sinclair
himself on British courses don’t bear it out.
And there is the case of Michael Scott, who
during liis sojourn in Melbourne was easily
the best amateur of his day. He had never
been a front-rank player in Britain, and, on
his return, did not show any marked improve-
ment in form.
* * * *
“Ploughman”: The man who borrows a
ball and returns it “slightly soiled” at the
end of the round is a too-familiar figure in
golf. Chopper is a shining example; in his
case the trouble is aggravated by the fact
that he fancies himself with the niblick and
uses that punishing iron more than is neces-
sary. The other day he borrowed a ball from
his partner in a foursome, and gave it back
somewhat wilted. “Tell me. Chopper,” said
its owner, looking at the ruin, “do you strop
your niblick every round cur just once a day?”
* % * *
“Mid-iron” : “Buffing Spoon,” complaining
of the increasing cost of golf-club member-
ship in Australia (B. 31/3/’27), can take
comtort in considering the case of the new
Pine Hills club at Addington, near London.
The entrance fee is £500 and the annual sub-
scription 100 guineas. Membership is re-
stricted to 150, which is not surprising, since
mugs willing to come at such a stiff propo-
sition must be scarce, even in England.
* sis ❖ ❖
“Mower”: The North Queensland golf
championship is being played this week in
Townsville, where it was introduced in the
early ’nineties by a keen Scottish barrister
who is now Judge Macnaughton. The links
in those days were primitive, and thickly
grown with Sida retusa —which, for the infor-
mation of those fortunate enough to be
ignorant of its nature, may be described as
vegetable wire, growing densely to a height
of three feet or so. Once in a forest of this,
a ball, even if found, was unplayable; matters
were little better if the stuff was cut, for
the tough, bristling stems stopped even the
heaviest niblick cutting through. Fortunately,
there were occasional patches of grass in
between, and these permitted the desultory
pursuit of the game, though it was difficult
to avoid what may euphemistically be called
“clergyman’s” sore throat, owing to the con-
tinual necessity for vocal criticism.
* * * *
“Buffing Spoon”: As to those Queensland
goannas which were credited with getting
away with golf balls (B. 31/3/’27), let me
cite this instance. Playing on a N.Q. course,
years ago. one of the members killed a
goanna. Opening the lizard to get the fat
for greasing his clubs, ho found two golf
balls. It was just after a general election,
and a Scottish member of the club who had
lost his seat in Parliament had been playing
over the links. A few days after the story
of the goanna’s content got about, the club
secretary received a letter from the defeated
member. He said he had lost three golf balls
on the course on the day the goanna was
killed, and demanded a recount.
“Galle Face” : Other agencies than crows
(B. 14/4/’27) are sometimes responsible for
shifting golf balls. The Colombo club re-
cently stumbled on a practice of its Cingalese
caddies which accounted for a lot of strange
happenings. The caddies w T ere accustomed
to gamble on the play, and usually each
backed his employer. When he got to the
ball, the guileless Asiatic shifted it to a
good lie if it was in a bad one, or vice
versa if he desired to stiffen his employer.
The shifting was done with the caddy's pre-
hensile toes, so there was no suspicious stoop-
ing to give the game away. And since the
whole mob was in the joke no one cared to
take the risk of squealing in the event of a
double cross.
Miscellaneous
“Pipards”: Wisden’s takes no pains to
disguise its opinion that the 1926 Australian
team was distinctly disappointing, especially
in view of all the preliminary boosting,
although the players were, of course, in no
way responsible for this. Test matches, it
is pointed out, outweigh everything else in
importance nowadays, and England proved
its superiority in the only one played to a
finish. And, though Collins’s men only sus-
tained this one defeat, their record as scalp-
collectors was a poor one. Of their 12
victories, only two were gained against
counties among the “Big Six,” when Lanca-
shire and Notts were walloped, each by an
innings. The other counties defeated were
Hampshire • and Glamorgan, and the four
shires which finished at the very bottom of
the list. The other wins were against Oxford
University, Durham and two Scottish sides.
Full justice is done by Wisden’s to several
of the batsmen, notably Macartney and
Woodfull. but. with all allowances made for
illnesses, accidents and bad weather, the
A. J. WATSON, depicted here by Lafayette,
is one of the slickest movers over
hurdles Victoria and Australia have ever
seen. His many laurels include the
Australasian 440 yards hurdles, cut out
in 56 1-5sec.
bowling is ranked below standard, only
Mailey (at his best) being realty dangerous
against the pick of England’s batting.
Everett, one learns, didn’t strike English
critics as a fast bowler, either in the air
or off the pitch, and on his form—though this
may have suffered through an injury—would
have found difficulty in getting into an
average county team.
“Shrewsbury”; Warner’s statement that
he had never met a good cricketer who was
conceited leads me to wonder how many
good cricketers “Plum” has missed. W. G.
Grace, to whom he refers in the same deliver-
ance, was no shrinking violet on the subject
of his own value. One thinks, too, of
old Tom Emmett, going in late to bat for
Yorkshire when all the cracks had been dis-
missed cheaply: “There’s noon out yet o' any
note.” In later days, Ranjitsinghi. Maclaren,
Noble, Ivelleway, Armstrong and Macartney—-
to take a few at random —have always had a
proper sense of their dignity, and have im-
pressed it on the multitude with all the
aloofness of a newly-appointed second
lieutenant in the A.I.F. And “Plum” him-
self wasn’t absent from parade when the
swank issue was given out, as his cricket
writings show.
“Cluck Cluck” : Snail-racing (B. 31/3/’27)
may be alj very well, but the agony of wait-
ing to see your fancy cut down by a short
eye on the post, so to speak, is too long-
drawn-out for temperamental punters. There’s
not enough bustle in the game, and I’m
recommending chicken-racing instead. Take
the young chickens out of the coop the required
distance away; then get a confederate to
feed the hen. When she begins to cluck,
empty the chicks out of the hat or basket
you have yarded ’em in, and you’ll see some
real sprinting. A few trials will soon give
you an idea of the form, and, if you don’t
overdo it, picking the right bird before the
start may bring in some chicken feed when
you kid the boys up for a flutter some Sunday
morning. Watch the crooks, though. One
of them stopped my best sprinter once, just
as he was getting into his stride, by chucking
a pinch of rice in front of him. The greedy
bird stopped to eat it, and an outsider got
home.
“Flugelschutte”: A quaint sporting event
was billed to take place in Brisbane yester-
day—the annual “bird shoot” of the Danish
Association. An old Scandinavian —and
Scottish- —sport, it was introduced to Bris-
bane in 1883 by Peter Thomle. For years
the gathering was held alternately in Mel-
bourne, Sydney and Brisbane, but with the
dying out of the old Danish brigade it has
shrunk back to the place of its origin in
Australia. The “bird” is carved out of wood,
wears a crown on its head, and carries a
lemon in its beak. The shooters fire in turn,
taking the objectives in this order: lemon,
crown, head, right and left wings, tail and
heart. The lad who gets the heart collects
first prize, a gold medal, and the title of
Bird King till next shoot. Prizes are given
for successfully shooting off the different
parts of the fowl, but the unhappy person
who hits the wrong mark stops a fine and
gets the “bird” as well. Fallen as it is
from its former glory, the function cau still
claim a band to liven up proceedings, with
plenty of good liquor and a dinner and
dance to follow.
“Billy til’ Goose”; Stoppin’ a ped. when ’e
won’t run a bye is easy enough. The trouble
is t’ keep th’ cow stopped. The cove I
learned th’ game from told me of a ’eart-
breakin’ double put up on am in th’ Ole
Dart, w’en ’e’d just worked out of’is appren-
ticeship and was in business on ’is own. ’E
'ad a lad matched agin a chap owned an'
trained by some young toffs; conditions, 130
yards an’ 50 pound a side. We ’ad 'ard
work gettin’ at the other cove, ’is bosses bein’
a rotten suspicious lot. The race was run in
a big ground belongin’ to a pub, w’.ere both
th’ men were changin’ into runniri togs. The
toffs left their man to go down to the bettin’
for a minute, an’ in 1 nips with a big can
of stout. “Fifty if you drink this,” I says.
“Done,” ’e says, grabs the £5O-note and
swallers the stout. • Down I goes and the
boys laid him to his bosses at 6 to 4 till
there was no more money. Well, th’ swine
won by 10 yards. We waited a long time
f’r ’im to come back to the bedroom an’ ’is
clothes, till th’ landlord shot us out. ’E’d
got away in an overcoat an’ a cab. Tli’
toffs tole me about it later. Soon as I’d
gone ’e got rid of th’ stout, put th’ note
in ’is belt an’ told th’ young mugs. They
offered ’im another 50 on top of th’ stakes
to win, an’ ’e sold us like catsmeat, th’
ungrateful ’ouqd !
“Izaac”: About as good bait for black
bream as any (B. 7/4/’27) are grasshoppers.
Finding myself without the necessary enticer
one day, I chased round for a substitute.
Grasshoppers were the only likely things
that I could see, and in desperation I ran
dowm a supply. Soon I had as many fish
as I cared to carry the 10 miles home.
“M.G.S.”: The Utiekah 111., a 37-ton
ketch-rigged auxiliary yacht, is about to
start from Melbourne on the biggest cruise
in Port Phillip yachting annals. She will
take in Noumea, Fiji, Tahiti, the Marquesas
and the North American coast, and Elliott
Giles, a Melbourne Grammar School master,
will be her skipper. Giles began his sea-
faring career when a junior teacher in Adel-
aide, nosing about the mangrove-fringed estu-
aries of the Port Adelaide River. Ilis thirst
for adventure turned him into a first-rate
small-craft navigator who should see the
latest venture through, if anybody can. Dur-
ing the war Giles brightened the pages of
the English Yachting Monthly with
vividly-told tales of the messes he had got
in and out of in Spencer’s Gulf, Bass Strait
and other Australian waters. They were
written from the immediate neighborhood of
a howitzer in France.
* * ❖ *
“Hack Point”: I have just left a lady
lamenting that she couldn’t sell her fox-
terrier puppies from a first-class bitch
brought from Ireland, by one of the best
dogs in Queensland. In the Quid Sod she
used to make anything from 10 to 20 guineas
out of a litter, but in this land of promise
business is rotten. Of course, there are a
few fanciers who will pay good prices for
what they require, but Smith or Biggs, who
wants a decent little dog for the kids to play
with or to guard the suburban mansion, is
not a bit fussy. Any mongrel does.
Business, Robbery,, etc.
“Narara” : In 1911 I bought a piano for
£53. For 16 years it was in constant use
and its use included the banging and thump-
ing incidental to three youngsters learning
music. Also, we took it with us to five
different towns. Deciding to purchase a
player-piano, I sold the old instrument —for
£7O. Two weeks later. I saw it in the
window of a piano dealer marked “Slightly
used ; £97 10s.”

“Wollard” : The Speck’s apple-growers are
looking forward to a prosperous year. This
optimism is largely the result of the grant
of £50,000, furnished by the Federal Gov-
ernment but distributed by the State, whicii
tided many over the critical period succeed-
ing the general strike in Britain. Crops
have been so good that over 200,000 cases
have been shipped from the Tamar Valley
alone; 60 per cent, have been consumed on
the mainland at favorable prices.

“Dad”: Cassava, now figuring definitely
in the N.Q. power-alcohol scheme, isn't hard
to grow in climates free from frost. You
only have to stick a bit of it in the ground
—root or branch doesn’t matter —and it will
grow. Even if it isn’t needed to drive Lizzie
it has uses. There was a Scot, misleadingly
named Tom Moore, who grew the stuff at
Rockhampton years ago and swore it made
a darned good substitute for either oatmeal
or cornflour. He made parritch and cakes
and blanc mange out of it and ate them with
as much enjoyment as a Scot ever discloses.
* * * *
“D. Rum”: One of the handicaps Ger-
many had to contend with in 3914-18 was
the cutting-off of petrol supplies. Power
alcohol was distilled to provide motor fuel,
mostly from sugar-beets. Next time there
is a war there’ll be a new ersatz. News
about it leaked out through the pride of
the inventors, who showed at the Philadel
phia exhibition a contraption that can be
fitted over any baker’s oven to distil alcohol
out of the yeast fumes. It isn't a commercial
process—the stuff costs about twice as much
as it is worth at current market values—
and there’s only one rational answer to the
question why Teuton chemists went to such
a lot; of trouble.
* * * *
“Wang”: One of the most picturesque
spots about the waterfront, of Melbourne is
the Little Dock at the foot of Spencer-street.
There shelter the small ships that trade 1
along the Victorian coast and breast the
billows in Bass Strait. Manned by crews of
three or four, these tiny craft represent the
only means many settlers in parts remote
from the railway have of getting their pro-
duce to market. Dairy produce, wattle-
bark, fish, maize, potatoes, hides and furred
skins they bring to the city marts, return-
ing with an equally varied assortment of
goods for their customers. Now and again
they carry a passenger, generally some adven-
turous youth. But the day of the Little
Dock is nearly done. When the Spencer-
street bridge becomes an accomplished fact
the small ships will have to find another
anchorage.

then writing them off at a comfortable pace
and at their leisure? Perhaps they won’t
want to, but if “C. Junior” has ever worked
in a telegraph office he should know the
lengths some firms will go to find out wliat
other firms are up to. And in war time-
well, what was Australia's costly censorship
staff for in the late conflict if not to keep
information from the enemy? And if any-
body can receive the beam’s messages, what
will the censors censor?
“Saaedi”: “Birre Gurra” says (B
14/4/’27) that I “bleat” of the beauties ot
droving, which he himself finds unpleasant
and unprofitable. I have done a good deal or
droving and enjoyed it. despite the occasional
hardships, wherefore “Birre Gurra s ’ whine
for sympathy fails to impress me. He declares
that he and his mates are getting only 31s.
Bd. per day, whereas I claimed that £2 per
day was coming to be regarded as a minimum
in many places. Possibly I did not make m>
meaning clear, but £2 per day, or a shade
under, has been the amount I have invari-
ably seen paid, during the past three years,
to one man personally taking charge of a
mob of sheep. If the mob was so large
that he needed to employ labor the amount
was higher. In referring to drovers I meant
the men who actually take charge ot sheep,
not drovers’ offsiders, billy-hoilers, dog-
wallopers or horse-tailers.

STOCKINGS
At the last day of the A.,T.,C. meeting
women depended for warmth on the sheep
and the wolf; the former's wool was about
her in plaid, in broadcloth and in tweed,
and the la i ter’s pelt, or those of his furry
brethren, warmed her thorax, or kept the
creaks in her shoulder-blades at bay. Sables
enfolded Mrs. Herbert Field, and trimmed
Airs. Tony Hordern. Judge Coyle’s three
girls were among the decorations of the
official stand during the week, and Betty
Wilson in powder blues was again one who
repaid a second glance. The styles that
had been worn on the first Saturday turned
*P again on Thursday, but in fewer milli-
ners. so that the girl in her velvet coat and
check skirt wasn’t suddenly aghast at find-
ing herself in what was practically a uni-
form. Nesta Griffiths wore a white hat with
distinction, and among the well-frocked from
Melbourne was Airs. Harry Rosenthal, who
wore a fantasy in green and gold caped in
black and topped by headgear smart and
small and sable of hue.
The two dance successes of the week were
the Autumn Ball at the Wentworth and that
of the Greek community at the Ambassadors.
The former was to swell the building fund
of St. Anne’s Church at Bondi, and the
second, which is an annual money-spinner,
this year divided its profits between its old
friend the Royal Alexandra Hospital for
Children and the Limbless Soldiers’ Aquatic
Club Appeal. The Autumn Ball revelled in
the tawny splendor of April's gardens, and
1 lie stimulus of Jack Frost’s breath was seen
in the ruddy blush of leafy trails and massed
chrysanthemums. Even the debs, carried
posies of sturdy red dahlias that suggested a
diet of iron, nux vomica and port wine.
The visit of the Duke and Duchess has
left more badly-strained relations between
Federal and State politicians than ever
existed before. Because N. S. Wales has the
hick to have the Federal Capital surrounded
by its own territory, its politicians expected
treatment preferential to that of the reps, of
other States at the opening. When the new’s
got out that there was no inside running
for them, there were reprisals ; M’s.II.R, were
practically excluded from the invitations to
State functions given to honor the ducal
couple. Not a single Federal member re-
vived an invitation to attend the gala per-
ormance at Her Majesty’s; Priminister
truce's secretary had to bustle round to
get his chief a seat. A clerk in the Federal
Service was put in charge of the arrange-
ments as far as the Federal representation
at functions was concerned. A group of
Al’s.P. called upon him to see if there
were no privileges going for them; they
wanted particularly to see the free theatrical
show. “It’s impossible. Why, I couldn’t
even arrange for a ticket for myself!” said
the official candidly.
The Hospital Saturday Fund is backing
the Aerial Derby, which is to-morrow’s big
stunt in Sydney. Gaily-colored, gas-filled
balloons will be aerodromed in Martin-place
and Customs House-square. You pay your
shilling and have your pick of them. The
craft is then let loose, and after bidding it
a heartening farewell you return to your
home or office with its identification disc in
your bag. Should your balloon travel further
from the Post Office than all the other gay
blobs, and the finder return the tag to the
Fund’s H.Q. within teu days, then you win
a trip to the Jenolan Caves, or the Moon,
or Heaven —the prize is for two, and you see
the destination according as you are youth or
middle-age.
The modern girl’s roving eye has found
the lavender-sweet glories of mother’s old
wedding dress. The richness of the Duchesse
satin of yesteryear is a thing neither despised
nor rejected of the bride of to-day. A Stratli-
ficld young thing swelled the number of the
girls who have lately said their “I wills” from
mother’s made-over wedding dress. She was
Ruth Beardsmore, elder daughter of the Lieut.-
Colonel Beardsmore couple, and the sheen of
her crystal-weighted satins flooded St. Anne’s
Church with light. The young man in the
case was Tom AVaters, of Mundroola. Coolali.
Congratulations were exchanged at the local
Town Hall under the directorship of the
bride’s parents.
Clever amateur actress Marguerite Alazen-
garb (her father was perhaps the first osteo-
path in Australasia), who came to Sydney
from Dunedin (M.L.) to make a name for
herself, has changed her intentions. The one
she has chosen belongs to Frank Warren
Messenger, one time of Birmingham, now a
successful business man in Sydney. During
the war he served with the Royal Air Force.
Tall and slim and looking like a reincarna-
tion of the feathery chrysanthemums she
carried, Mavis Oswald rustled into St.
Swithin’s Church at Pymble for her wedding
with Iledley Carpenter. Mavis 'is a popular
Pymble girl, whose father, a pioneer of
Broken Hill, is the owner of Oswald’s Bond
in Sydney, and the groom is only son of a
well-known Lindfield family.
A real cobweb and thistledown confection
floated about a starry-eyed bride last week.
She was Marjorie Hartland when she blew
into St. James’s, and Mrs. Alan Fleming
at the other end of the journey. Both
parties hailed from Mosman. The wedding
garment was mainly begemmed silken lace
over pleated georgette, which in its turn
was silvered over with diamente. There was
a train all lace and pink georgette with a
silver edging that looked like a sunset cloud.
Sisters Brenda and Mollie, in roseate taffe-
tas, added color to the pageant. Mrs. Hart-
land came into the picture as hostess to the
wedding party at the Ambassadors.
The names in one matrimonial entangle-
ment promise well. This Letter cheered to
learn that Mr. Cupid had married Miss
Wright. Than which no better combination
could be (v.earned.
Back in Sydney, Chryssa Crichton-Imrie,
of whom one of Lipton’s agents in London
declared: “Miss Crichton-Imrie? Oh yes,
she could sell honey to a bee!” That was
after Miss Crichton-Imrie had been talking
the superlative qualities of Australian honey
to him at a show of Empire food products.
The lady, who started life as a journalist
in Maoriland. went to London about six
years ago to spread the glad tadings of our
dried and preserved fruits, our jams and our
preserved meats. Now one of the most
popular lunching-places in London is the
Black Swan tea-rooms, first started as the
food-propaganda headquarters of the West-
ralian Government, and now carried on by
the enthusiastic Australian. Wherever she
has gone she has talked of the purity and
the excellence of Australian foodstuffs, and
she claims that hers is the honor of intro-
ducing passion-fruit to the tables of the
English middle class. She brings back with
her a Book of Revelations concerning adul-
terated foodstuffs that is more fearsome than
any Frankenstein. There’s a gruesome story
of the chef who boils pennies with the peas
to turn them from anaemic tinned to spring-
like green. Miss Crichton-Imrie will be in
Sydney for another three or four months
and will then return to London by way of
Egypt, where she has business interests.
In this May Moore picture you see one of
the finest women organists in the big world.
She is Lilian Frost; and at one time Sydney
was very close
to having her
as its city
organist, for
sh e was a
runner up to
the present
Prime Mini-
ster of the
Town Hall
organ the
gifted Tru-
man. M i s s
Frost, who is
setting out for
Europe an d
America, hopes
to attend the
great Salzburg
Festival, an d
to visit every
organ of note
both in the
Old and the
not so New
World. Her testimonial concert during the
week at the Town Hall left no doubt as to
her popularity as a musician and an indi-
vidual. Among her encores she numbered
the spirited “Australian Patrol,” by Sydney
composer May Summerbelle.
Vocalist Neville Smith, who always car-
ries his paint-box with him on his holiday
jaunts, struck luck in an unexpected quar-
ter. He was in Noumea and had been
sketching and painting bits of color that
stirred liis holiday fancy. One of the store-
keepers saw the works and asked permission
to show a few in his window. Then came
a sort of informal request for the artist to
exhibit his water-colors. To his surprise
the newly-appointed Governor of Noumea.
M. Guyon, came along and bought five of
them for Government House.
A cheer goes up over the 52nd report of
the Infants’ Home at Ashfield. Last year
179 mites, many under 12 months old. were
cared for, and over 70 mothers. A unique
feature of the work is the care of infants
when mothers have to go into hospital.
Old Sydney friends were gathered about
the guest-table at the Lyceum Club when
the Italian Ambassador, Della Torretta, and
liis Marchesa were farewelled by artistic
London. Lute and Jean Drummond occupied
seats near the potentates, and not far from
them sat the convert to Mohammedanism,

a t Philadel-
phi a. Well
known in Vic-
toria, she recently has been paying a visit to
Melbourne*, and played in Australasian and
Autumn championships. One day last week
a young man named Roland Conway, who
has been three years absent from Australia
and is now playing Fairfax in “Sweet Nell,”
beckoned Floris into St. Mary’s. She
emerged with a plain gold ring on her hand
and a change of name. Father O’Connor
supervised the alterations, and the bride was
buttressed by her uncle and aunt, the
Andrew Loves. Her dress was of white
georgette, showing an uneven hem-line, and
it had a shoulder-knot of orange-blossom.
With this she wore a white felt hat and
carried an ivory-bound prayer-book. The
new Mrs. Conway is the only daughter of
the late Dr. and Mrs. St. George, old-time
residents of Elizabeth-street, Hyde Park.
Esther Sclioellkopf, second daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Schoellkopf, of Buffalo,
N.Y., became engaged during her stay in
Sydney to Ernest Kramer; and the lady left
in the Osterley to meet her fiance’s parents
in Switzerland, and her own parents in
Paris. On her return the home will be
Rose Valley, out of Cooma, which Mr.
Kramer bought from Commander Chance.
The slim and elegant Diana Watts, who
lectured on the way to carry your diaphragm
in the old Greek manner, gave a piquant ad-
dress on Bernard Shaw the other afternoon.
The occasion was an invitation to the pic-
turesque home of the E. J. Taits in Edgecliff-
road. Tlie objective was a speeding-up of
interest in the Repertory movement. In the
absence of Mum and Dad, two smiling young
daughters waited on the doorstep to see a
crush of damp arrivals safely out of dripping
macs (it was one of Noah's bad days) and
pass them on to a fairyland. The English
visitor, accompanied by General Rudkin, who
carries a crutch in memory of the war, is a
personal friend—-with mental reservations —of
Bernard Shaw, and the literary giant with
the bad manners would probably have chir-.
raped gleefully if he had savored the sharp
sauce with which the lady of gracious motion
served him up.
At the Chatswood Town Hall on May 7,
in a playlet written by her daughter Zora,
Mrs. Cross will contribute an abo. dance
which she learned from the blacks in Queens-
land nearly 60 years ago. The dance, which
concerns a witch doctor and his triumph over
Time by the reversion of old age to smiling
youth, should prove interesting to anthropolo-
gists. It will take up about 12 minutes in
a concert given by pupils from Lenore
Graham’s classes.
One Paris designer showed knee-length
coats made from Eve’s ruin, and so nutty
that there’s a rush on them for the spring.
One in grey skins was shaped like a riding-
coat with a neat turned-down linen collar;
with it went trimly-fitting leggings. A Syd-
ney girl at Monte Carlo writes of an outfit
seen on the Terrace. It was a grey skirt
with deep hem of snakeskin worn with a
complete snakeskin jumper, shoes and hat
to match. Near by lowed a coat and skirt
of calf-skin.
Agnes Murphy's no. from London:—
The Sydney giil Phyllis McDonald was one of the
four students at the Royal Academy of Music who
were asked to take the place of the famous Lener
Quartette, put out of action through the leader, Mr.
Lener, breaking liis arm the day before. Phyllis, as
leader, acquitted herself more than well. Her three
companions were Londoners. Lionel Tertis, the great
viola player, said, “Not many of the professional
quartettes could have done so well.” Their playing
of two Beethoven quartettes which some veterans
would hesitate to tackle without adequate rehearsal
was really excellent, and in the opinion of many
brought them within measurable distance of the
celebrated players for -whom they were deputising.
There’s a lady at Waverley who
celebrated her 97th birthday on our wettest
Good Friday and was moved to wonder what
the Tank Stream would have looked like in
all that rain. As a girl, the stream was
well known to her ; she used to draw buckets
of water from it for her mother. Mrs. Jessie
Davis is still so interested in things that she
was driven out to have a look at the Duke
and Duchess, and she makes the family-
puclding every Christmas.
Elspeth Phelps (Mrs. Fox Pitt), the super-
dress-designer who successfully sued Paquin’s
the other week for breach of contract, built
every stitch worn by Gladys Moncrieff in
“The Blue Mazurka,” the new musical play
at Daly’s in which the Sydney singing girl
at last conquered London. Here’s her
description of two sumptuous creations that
the now sylph-like damsel wears: (1) A
white satin, the gleaming surface of it. the
background for exquisite silver and crystal
embroidery set between rows of silver-lined
crystal fringe. On the left shoulder is a
spray of soft white chiffon flowers, and the
stalks and leaves of silver fall almost to the
waist. (2) Orchid mauve and pale pink
satin, the latter material appearing as a
vest in the front of the corsage, flanked by
overlapping petals of the mauve satin, panels
of which (embroidered at the hem with
clusters of grapes shading from pink to
mauve) open to reveal the pink foundation
as one moves. With this goes a coat to
match the dress embroidered in silver and
collared with hazel fox. The lining is pale
pink.
The Freddie Shipmans, who brought Aor-
dica, Bispham, Paul Dufault. Altliouse and
Middleton and other celebrated artists to
Australia, gave a party at. the Mark Hop-
kins, San Francisco’s newest and swagger
hotel, in honor of the Roland Fosters. Mrs.
Alfred Hertz, whose husband is conductor
of the Symphony Orchestra, also entertained
the Sydney visitors, and Mayor James Rolpli
—you remember “Glad-hand Jimmy”?—
extended civic hospitality. In Portland.
Oregon, they were the guests of the Music
Teachers’ Association, at a reception in the
Ellison White Conservatory.
The small boy was being taken down at
the end of the grown-ups' dinner party to
say “How do?” to various uncles and aunts.
As a final celebration nurse had put a small
dab of eau-de-Cologne on his tunic. “H-m-mi
You do smell nice!” she remarked. So the
nipper went below feeling that he was as frag-
rant as the lily ‘of Sharon. He shook hands,
with the men, and allowed the ladies to kiss
him without demur. They admired his tunic,
his shoes and his socks, but of the unusual
bit of his toilet they said no word. At last
he could bear the neglect no longer. A
horrible doubt assailed him that to some
other might be going the credit that was
his own. Drawing away from the table, he
said shyly but firmly: “If you smell a
smell, it’s me!”
T. Pringle meets friends in East Africa:
The other day my job took me to Londiani, not
many miles from the Equator. The big event for
the afternoon was a cricket match, so I wandered
over from the hotel to see the game. To my delight
I found no fewer than seven Sydney and Melbourne paL
playing—four on one side and three on the other. The
side with the four won. Two players sported the
North Shore Grammar badge, three wore faded old
Geelong Grammar blazers, one the red, white and
blue of Melbourne Cricket Club, while a St. Kilda
scarf and an old A.I.F, hat distinguished another.
. .. .Next month, after an absence of six years, the
P. de Y. Allen couple will sight Sydney Heads. He's
been in the Native Affairs Department at Kenya for
some years, his biggest interruption being caused by
the war, which took him soldiering to Egypt and
France. Extended furlough and the Osterley bring
him back to Australia. Mrs. Allen is the only daugh-
ter of Mrs. G. Dickson, of Toorak.
A not very attractive circular to amateur
actors lias been issued by the Repertory
Society. The society is “anxious to promote
that taste for better plays of which there has
been such a gratifying revival in Europe. "
To this end it flashes a prize of £2O together
with a trophy before the eyes of amateur
dramatic companies, and invites them to com-
pete. The play produced must be a one-acter
or extract from a longer play, and must not
exceed 40 minutes in performance. The entry
fee of 10s. will be received up to June 30.
And a further prize of £lO will be awarded
if the winning production is by an Australian
writer. The prizes are not exactly dazzling:
but, at any rate, the Sydney Rep. is doing
something—which is more than can be said
for a good many people who ought to be
interested.

The Watchword
for Elegance
and Efficiency
The Timepiece for all Time
It is curious to think that the one
thing in the world which is most
mechanical in its action, and
most practical in purpose, should
be also the most beautiful in design.
Wafer-like, durable, artistic, and,
above all, accurate, the Elgin is
indeed a Timepiece for all time.

Billions of Bubbles
drench the base of your beard
The moisture gets down to the bottom of
each whisker. That means a smoother,
cleaner shave.
ORDINARY LATHER
This lather-picture
(greatly magnified)
of ordinary shaving
cream shows how
large, air-filled bub-
bles fail to get down
to the base of the
beard, and how
they hold air, in-
stead of water,
against whiskers.
This “small-bubble” lather
has been developed to soften
your beard with water.
Water, science proves, is the
only effective beard-softener.
More water at the base of
whiskers means a quicker,
cleaner shave.
“Small-bubble” lather holds
more water, gets closer to the
beard-base. The lather pic-
tures prove this. And it is
at the base of the beard that
the razor does its work.
Because your beard is pro-
perly softened at its base,
your razor works easily and
quickly. Every hair is cut
close and clean. And your
face remains cool and com-
fortable throughout the day.
COLGATE LATHER
This picture of Col-
gate lather shows
how myriads of
tiny, moisture-
laden bubbles hold
water, not air, in
direct contact with
the base of the
beard, thus soften-
ing every whisker
right where the
razor works.

THE RESORT OF THE MOST
DISTINGUISHED VISITORS.
The Hotel Windsor is constantly resorted to for
leading official functions in Melbourne and amongst
great personages who have been entertained within
its walls are none less than Royalty itself. It has.
also been the residence, whilst in Melbourne, of the
world’s most distinguished actors, musicians and
other important overseas visitors.

Precautions for tlie safely of the York's
were meticulous at the Mayoral ball, and
many of the guests caught no glimpse of
royalty. When the royal pair arrived at
the Exhibition Building a guard drawn from
the Navy, Army and Air Force ranged
itself in front of the waiting throng of
dancers, holding un the cord of demarcation
and obliterating the view of the procession
to the dais, which was very badly placed at
the end of the room, near the entrance. The
bodyguard almost mowed a path through
the guests when Prince and Princess walked
down the long room to view the decorations
at close range. The Mayor and Mrs. Morell
certainly did their share of the party well,
though the best of the supper did not come
on until after midnight, and those who left
early had to be content with canned meat
sandwiches, cake and coffee. The big
draughty barn was given the aspect of the
courtyard of a baronial castle, and from
turrets and towers floated pennons mixed
with heraldic devices. A drop-scene of
Windsor Castle hung over the stage, which
was a bower of chrysanthemums and be-
gonias, with a bordering of maidenhair; a
mossy bank that seemed to blend right into
the Thames had "Welcome” liorticulturally
picked out. At the end of the room there
was a back-cloth realistically depicting a
hit of Australian bush. Those bidden to sup
with the Yorks passed through a garden to
the palais annexe, where the feast was laid.
Giant chrysanthemums in pots formed the
greater part of the floral embellishment, and
harmonising lights, twinkled through trellis-
work below the galleries.
The Duchess appeared in pink of La
France rose hue. with a double train and
some splashing of diamente. Her jewels in-
cluded a tiara, and she held a pink feather
fan. The State Governor was accompanied
by Lady Somers, whose frock was of flame
tone overlaid with scintillation. The Coun-
tess of Cavan wore a black robe, and the
other lady-in-waiting figured in mauve with
a dash of pink. The Mayoress wore reseda
tissue gleaming with gold and veiled in ninon,
with embroidery of wee pink roses. Her
handsome daughter Sheila's silver frock was
woven into a lace border over pink. Mayors
and aldermen appeared in their robes of
ottice. and these, with sparkling feminine
gowns and many brilliant uniforms, made a
delightful picture. Society was well repre-
sented and there were some visitors from
other States. Admiral Napier’s wife had
apricot-tinted apparel, Premier Allan’s life-
partner was in a black jetted robe, and a
mist of grey georgette and silver lace clouded
Mrs. Thomas Baker. Mrs. Douglas Stewart
lmd an ermine wrap over grey-blue
raiment, and Mrs. W, Merry was in peacock -
blue georgette and jade embroidery.
Pink with radiation was the fancy of the
Ohauvel lady; Bath Westertoii was a nice
flapper whose sheath of leaf-green satin had
a knot of water-lilies ys relief; and Lucy
Xtogdale’s cornflowcr-oluc frock featured the
charm of inch tucks.
When is a model not a model? Many
asked themselves that question at the G.-G. s
ball for the royal pair. Even the Duchess,
when she met the twin of her gown, must
have wondered. Mrs. Eggleston and Mrs.
Geoffrey Syme were able to swap notes
when they discovered that their frocks were
identical, but royalty can’t ask or bo asked
questions on such subjects. About four
thousand guests were set down at Govern-
ment House door, and the ballroom was
crowded by ten o’clock, when tin* throng
was drafted into two mobs to make way
for the royal entry. Melba came in as part
of the entourage, probably her first entrance
anywhere without plaudits. The Duchess
sparkled in white and crystal that molted
below the waistline into a floral beaded
design of pale pink roses and green leaves
and ended in a crystal fringe. Diamonds
and emeralds, ropes of pearls, some bracelets,
and a pearl-tipped tiara decked her tiny
form. Lady Stonehaven wore a vivid blue
trained gown embellished with silver leaves,
with diamonds in her hair. Lady Somers
was in apricot georgette and gold lacc.
The Renown band played and the Yorks
were among the most energetic dancers.
Decorations were limited to groupings of
crimson coleus, foliage plants and giant
chrysanthemums. The affair was too big
to be really enjoyable. Lots of people who
did not dance stood around blocking the
way The Duchess, who chats to her part-
ner "all the time she whirls, was as bright
as ever and bestowed smiles upon all within
vision during lulls in the dance. It looks
as if the crystal and beaded fashion of the
moment is not going to hold favor. Many
of the most attractive frocks were of geor-
gette, or velvet devoid of trimming. Lady
Cavan was clad in powder-blue velvet, and
Mrs. Gilmour chose platinum lame, embroi-
dered all over. Melba’s white-and-black
raiment was a foil to a great display of
diamonds. .Airs. Urookcs niui-
mured “Deuce” whe.n she cast her eye mi
11 R Ll.'s gown. There were minor varia-
tions', but both were certainly cut from the
same design. The Eggleston-Syme duplica-
tion was of georgette of a deep burgundy hue,
with bunches of blossoms of the same color
on shoulder and at waistline. Mrs. bepti-
mus Miller had some remarkable diamonds
in liair-band and necklet above white and
crystal covering. All pink pearls and flesh-
pink georgette was the Clarke lady. Mrs.
Collins, mother of Dale Collins, the author,
chose powder-blue. A sheath of silver, with
inlets of pale green, was worn by Mrs.
Rupert Downes, and a few fern-like traceries
in diamente wandered over the emerald-green
apparel of Airs. Harry Creswick. Hdward
Miller’s lady was regal in trained gown of
dull green and gold brocade, with edging
of gold fringe, and Alec Peacock’s lady was
pleasantly clad in black and gold brocade.
Mrs Pat Osborne, in pink and gold, and
Thomas Hughes and his lady represented
N S.W Mrs. Fitchett, from Terang, brought
her daughter Denise in green attire. There
was a bunch of debutantes, who probably
expected to be presented to the Duchess, but
the rehearsed salaams were not needed.
Francie Woolcott. in white panne velvet, was
making a first appearance. The T. A. Lab art.
couple, the .1. G. McLarens and their trio
of pretty daughters and Mrs. Mclnerney
and her 'daughter Aileen were sighted. 1 lie
rest of the picture contained Navy, Army
and Air Force uniforms.
The garden party given by the G.-G. and
Lady Stonehaven at Government House was
an umbrella affair. Few people dared to
wear aught but wintry attire, and tiie top-
hatted and morning-coated mingled with
women rolled up in furs and wraps that were
topped by millinery of velvet or felt. Mink or
squirrel 'worn over velvet gowns was the
principal feature of feminine dress. there
were only a few presentations to royalty.
Bagpipes and brass instruments discoursed
alternately. The Duchess was garbed as at
the Emily McPherson College opening, and
Lady Stonehaven was coated in chiffon velvet
in brown and gold tones, her Harmonising hai
being lace-edged. The State Governor and
Lady Somers joined the promenade beneath
the rain drops for a little while. Each
sprinkle of moisture caused a rush to tea-
tents. ballroom and dining-room, where
eatables and drinkables were waiting. -Ike
royal party had a special table in the ball-
room. much to the delight of . those who
clattered tea-cups in the vicinity. l.he
Mayoress was among the smartest preened,
wearing a dark brown velvet suit, and the
scholarly wife of Perth’s W alter James was
well wrapped in black sealskin, with hat ol
black velvet. Elsa Stralia was sighted in
the crowd; also James Elder and his lady,
Mrs. Herbert Brookes, a study in petunia
purple in suit and millinery, Mrs. Lee Neil,
in coat-dress of burgundy hue with trim-
ming of loops of the material, Madame
Maggie Stirling, the singer, Mrs. Penleigh
Boyd, and Mrs. R. R. Vincent, from Gee-
long, with her daughter Sammy.
The Duke has not inherited the voice of
his forefathers. The Windsor-Guelph family
has gained fame for purity of vocal tone
diction and discretion of phrasing as well
as for impressive simplicity of speech, the
Prince of Wales, like the Duke ,of Pork,
had an lion, degree conferred on him during
his visit. The liquid, crystal-clear speaking
voice of the Prince sent every word to the
farthest fringe of the outdoor crowd in
the grounds —crowds squeezed out from the
packed Wilson Hall. It was a severe test.
An important old Englishman, present on
that occasion, remarked that the. Princes
voice was a replica of that of his grand-
father. Edward VII. Prince Albert has
missed this part of the family possessions
just as, in a lesser degree, his father has
missed it. King George has a tremendous
voice: he booms when he talks, even m a
drawing-room. But his deep boom, thong a
pot at all unpleasant, has not the carrying
power of either liis fathers or his eldest
son's crystal tones.
VI tin 1 Parliamentary reception to the
Yorks, held last Thursday night, four orches-
tras and 14 choral societies did their level
best. Thev unloaded heavy artillery too —
the “Hallelujah Chorus” and "The .Heavens
Vre Telling.” and some of the “Elijah out-
bursts were part of the ammunition, and the
representation of Gernian-Austriau choral
masterpieces was rounded out with HaU,
Bright Abode” from “Taiinlninser. William
(V James conducted the combined forces m
his Australian Anthem, for which C. J. Dennis
had penned the words. The royal couple
not arriving until near ten o’clock, there was
a patriotic programme for their benefit. “God
Save” and “Rule Britannia” were followed
by “Thanks Be to God,” which coincided
with the release of drinks in the supper-room
and was sung heartily by all. Later on the
choir sang “For They Are Jolly Good Fel-
lows.” Then through paths of chrysanthe-
mums the Yorks passed on to supper. About
11.30 cars were called, and the waiting thou-
sands glimpsed the pretty royal lady’s silver
evening coat with its emerald-green satin
lining covering a gown of blush-pink with
gold lace and bead embroideries.. She wore
rubies and sapphires, and her tiara was of
diamonds in rose design. The souvenir oi
the occasion contained portraits of the Duke
and Duchess, and an excellent block of a
water-color sketch of the bush by Harold
Herbert.
Melbourne insisted upon classifying Betty
Windsor as No. 1 in the royal troupe. She
was installed as the story-book princess tor
whom half a million fists would be clenched
to “avenge even a look that threatened her
with insult” (to quote Burke on Marie
Antoinette). Part of her popularity, of
course, is due to the fact that she is the
first true-blue British girl that has married
into the Windsor family—and a braw Scottish
lassie at that.
The reason why policemen are policemen
is made clear. They are chosen because
they were born with a nice sense of what
is aisy and what isn’t. The Chatterer pre-
sented to one of the force a police-pass that
entitled her to stand quite, close to the
Yorks at one of the shivoos in their honor.
He admitted its puissance, but he. couldn t
refrain from a fatherly word. ‘I m sure,
he said, “you wouldn’t like to be oyer tnere.
You’d not be aisy among all those gintlemm.
On Friday the Yorks set out for Adelaide.
Trunks and packages innumerable were
pushed aboard the royal train. Flowers and
autumn foliage galore decorated a boudoir
that had coverings and cushions of shimmer-
ing pink and gold. The populace in their
thousands drew up behind barriers to wave
farewell to the couple, who. escorted by
Lancers, motored to Spencer-street, both
looking cheery. The Duchess was a sym-
phony in fawn and biscuit tones, wearing a
top-coat and a felt hat.
At the King's Theatre on Saturday night
Judith Anderson wore the verdant millinery
made famous by Michael Arl.en. She aired
two versions of it—a very vivid green .felt,
and, later, one of more temperate tone, with a
brilliant ornament. A full house received the
more or less nasty piece with mixed feelings.
At the finish Miss Anderson took a curtain
and paid tribute to Leon Gordon. A large
gilded laurel wreath and numerous posies
were offerings to the clever Australian
actress. Some smart well-cut suits, one of
tan hue and the other irt deep wine.shade,
were worn by the leading lady as Iris, and
on her first appearance she was encased in
widowly garb of black velvet, with touches of:
pink and some crystal. Her rival. Venice,
wore an evening frock of pink that glitteied
with cascades of pink crystal beads. Among
first-viewers were Mrs. W. S. Lucey, elder
daughter of J. J. Rouse, of Sydney, on a visit
from U.S.A.: the Tallis lady: the Charlie
Taits: Mrs. Scott, just back from the Big
Smoke; Dr. Kthel Osborne and daughter
Audrey, the Ivan Gutmann couple and Beryl
Ainslie.
This is Phyllis Crompton, who set Junior
Red Cross
work on its
feet in South
Australia. She
began her task
about a year
ag o. wli e n
fresh f r o m
school in Eng-
l.a n d and

perience of the

ment in Vi-
enna to give
her an insight
into soc i a 1
service. She
comes of a
line that
takes its du-
ties of citi-
zenship seri-
ously.
The curtain of the Athenaeum ascended to
disclose on Saturday night “The I nfair Sex,’
a comedy that may have been intended to warn
flippant young wives—and maybe not. Zillah
Bateman tilled the leading role and some
charming clothes. There was a frock of
mushroom pink satin with flowing sleeves.
and a skirt bordered with black satin and
gold ribbon. An evening gown of deep pink
was dolled up with crystal embroidery. A
white satin sports suit with a sleeveless colored
jacket was favored by Iverrie Kelly, who also
put on a delphinium-blue gown. 'The play got.
over all right, and the leading ladies filled
their taxis with flowers on the home run.
“The Ringer” was rung in upon a
Theatre Royal audience on Saturday night.
Moscovitch’s latest exploitation of the senti-
ments of the middle-aged won gratifying ap-
proval. Eileen Sparks came on in a name-
liued gown with an effective dash of black,
worn with a close-fitting hat combining the
two shades and acting as mooring-mast tor
two big blossoms. Mary Macgregor, whose
straight lines would delight both Euclid and
the designers of last year’s models for misses,
had a smart navy blue frock trimmed with
white silk braid. Aides Davidson and Mal-
colm attended with their wives, and others
who sympathised with Moscoviteh were the
John Taits, the Harry Emmerton couple, the
Robert Ivnox pair, the George Landales and
the Robert Bruces.

The V.A.T.C.’s meeting- on Saturday drew
a fairly large crowd, but dull skies made furs
and wintry raiment the only suitable apparel.
Mrs. T. A. Tabart brought Mrs. Campbell, of
Hobart, a study in violet tones from hat to
pleated frock and top coat. Dr. Guthrie
Plante’s wife was wrapped in a mole cape,
beneath which was a petunia-hued gown that
matched her felt millinery. A visitor from
England was Mrs. Clive Matthews, who
figured in black with a broad-leafed hat.
Mrs. A. Y. Kewney was tailored in fawn
gabardine with a black velvet hat. The
Governor-General was in the committee
members’ pen, but no vice-regal ladies put in
an appearance. Admiral Napier and Ins
wife, the Rogers-Thomsons. Mrs. Weston
Pett, Mrs. 11. S. K. Ward, Mrs. Merson
Cooper. Thelma Halbert, June Baillieu and
Beryl Camming were there.
Mrs. Collins is to visit England for the
marriage of her son. Dale Collins, the authoi.
in July. Dale Collins's latest novel. “The
Sentimentalist,” is expected shortly, and
another, “Vanity Under the Sun,” is in the
publisher's hands.
An old-world air hung over the fetter-forg-
ing of Barbara Mary Madden and Charles
Diartuid Gavan Duffy at St. Mary’s, East
St. Hilda. The bride was wrapped in a
shimmer of whitoi satin, caught with a
jewelled tassel, and orange-blossoms embel-
lished her long court train. A lace veil
which had seen service through five genera-
tions was confined with a wreath of orange-
blossoms, and in place of a floral burden
she held an ivory prayer-book. Little Anne
Borthwiek. from ( fippslan d, attended to the
train. Sister Alison, Justice Starke’s daugh-
ter Monica and Betty Robertson were the
'maids, who glowed like a sunburst in. a
froth of golden georgette. Their floating
veils of shining gold were encircled with
autumn leaves and streamers of ribbon. After
the ceremony, Henry Madden received the
guests, assisted by his daughters Eily and
Mrs. Leo Duffy, the newly-weds standing
under the traditional wedding-bell. The
bridegroom, a son of tlm late John Gavan
Duffy, has built a house at Camperdown for
his bride.
The British Music Society laid its wreath
on Beethoven’s tomb by giving a recital of
the great one’s works at the Assembly Hall
on Friday night. The chief offering was the
Romance in F for violin, played by Mar-
jorie Frockter, who later joined her mother
and sister Gwen, the 'cellist, in a well-
balanced performance of Trio No. 3 m C
Minor. Eileen Thompson, wearing pink
with a little glistening, let her light soprano
notes be heard, and the society’s string four
attacked the F Minor quartette with valor
but not with much success.
The Stradbrokes, who have been living
otl their estate in Suffolk since returning to
Blighty, have bought a London mansion m
Belgrave Square. Unlike many former
tenants of Government House, they still
keep in touch and make a point of attending
Australian shivoos and meeting wandering
Aussies.

Anzac Day was cloudless, and the com-
memoration services were well attended.
Lieut.-Governor Lennon was on a dais before
the new Town Hall, and the pipers played
before the 42nd, 47th and 49tli units. One
unit was composed entirely of Yellow taxi-
men. In the hospitable way of Brisbane,
Anzac Day means giving the returned men
another meal together.
Phyllis Irene Brown and Fred Derrick
were married at All Saints’. The bride was
in ivory crepe romaine, beaded in crystal
and silver, her long court train scolloped in
silver and decked with silver rosebuds and
diamente. A liand-broidered Brussels-lace
veil had small posies of orange blossom, and
die carried a sheaf of lilies. Mrs. Arthur
Bird, in lemon satin beaute, with gold fringe
and hat of gold tissue, and carrying a king-
fisher-blue ostrich feather fan, was matron
of honor, and Mavis Ilill and Eileen Just
bridesmaids.
In the Congregational Church, Ipswich,
the knot was tied betwixt Jos. Francis,
M.H.R., and Edna Clark Cribb, daughter of
the late J. C. Cribbs, of Garowie. White
chrysanthemums and frangipanni decked the
church. The bride wore silver lace over
gold taffetas and a veil of Limerick lace
lent by Airs. W. Esdale, Sydney. She car-
ried a bouquet of lilies and roses. Ida Brown
and Agues Francis ’maided in sunset pink
marietta with touches of gold and a blue
rose, with orange-tinted roses for bouquets.
The at-home given by the president of the
Brisbane Club was a big affair. W. H.
Strachan, according to custom, unveiled the
picture of retiring president Sabine, and
made a neat speech. Airs. Strachan wore
blue, with deep red roses, broidered in
crystal and gold.
Roses and chrysanthemums dressed up St.
Augustine’s for the marriage of Noela St.
John Tyrwhitt and Guy L’Estrange. The
bride was in ivory satin and her ivory train
was lined with pale pink. Her Limerick
veil had been worn by her great grand-
mother. Hal L’Estrange ’maided in shot
blue and silver.
On the same evening Leslie Gordon Camp-
bell, son of the New Farm Colin Campbells,
was married at Albion to Dorothy E. Cam-
bage. The bride wore ivory mariette and
Brussels-lace veil. Grace Cambage attended
in sunset taffetas.
In Toowoomba the Country Women’s
Association is very busy with its conference.
It was decided to support any protest against
interference with the present mode of ambu-
lance transport. Mrs. Blaxland’s paper
urging that a home be established for the
proper care of the mentally deficient was
read, and Air. Beyington contributed an in-
formative paper on the subject.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
That veteran traveller Airs. Henry Dob-
son, just now on her 33rd trip to the Cold
Country, has been awarded a medal by the
Alliance Francaise in Paris. Mrs. Dobson
has worked hard to make us parley-voo in
Hobart, and her drawing-room at Elboden-
place has been the rendezvous of the local
branch of the Alliance for year-.
The photo, shows Airs. J. A. Lyons, wife
of the Premier. The lady, who is still in
the early thir-
ties. is a very
effective public
speaker: last
general elec-
tion she stood
for Parlia-
ment, and very
nearly succeed-
ed in getting
a seat in the
Assembly. Mrs.
Lyons is keen-
ly interested in
immigr a t i o n
problems, and
her scheme of
training immi-
grant domestic
girls in hostels
at tin; capital
cities and of
allowing them
to work by the
hour for house-
wives who should require their services has
attracted considerable notice. “Immigrants
we must have,” says Mrs. Lyons; and then
thinks of her own six—bonny youngsters all
of them.
The Themistocles took away several well-
known womenfolk, amongst them Mrs.
Nicholls, Mrs. Fenn-Smith and her daughter
and Mrs. Gaynor (known to Hobart as May
Poulett Herris in her girlhood, but living in
Sydney for the last few years ). At Mel-
bourne the ship will pick up Mrs. Angela
Thirkell, Professor Mi-Kail's daughter, who
married George Thirkell of these parts.
Cynthia Stockley. the writer, was also on
board, and Mrs. Lane-Foole, whose designs
for decorations at Canberra have been
adopted. She is a niece of W. B. Yeats, the
Irish poet.
The Anzac Commemoration Service in the
Domain was an impressive affair. His Ex.
gave a fine address, and the whole ceremony
was reverently carried through.
The Continental ballroom and cafe has
passed from Mrs. Duncan's hands into those
of Gladys Smith, but the. the dansants and
the Wednesday and Saturday dances will
continue.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
For the Polo Ball. St. Mary’s, West Perth,
Jlew myriads of streamers and gay balloons
over its palm-fringed dancing-floor. His
Ex. and Lady Campion, she in cyclamen
georgette, smiled on the frivol. Airs. Frank
Lefroy, in a glinting beaded gown, dug up
the hidden treasure, a tiny gold polo stick
fashioned as a tie-pin, from the folds of her
paper dance-cap. Airs. Langlois Lefroy
looked beautiful as ever in gold; tall Airs.
Everard Darlot and Airs. Sam Grimwood
obose black; Doreen Brennan, orchid georg-
ette with sliimmery trimmings; pretty
Judith Black, cherry and crystal beads.
Even the seasoned grouchers had a fat
chuckle at “Polly with a Past,” while their
wives stared saucer-eyed at Renee Kelly’s
marvellous gowns. Renee, in golden lace
and a hat of cinnamon and ostrich feathers,
accompanied her husband, Hylton Allen, to
a Green Room Club party staged in their
honor. The rest of the co. came to sin tea
and hear sweet music. President Sammy
Hope Robertson did the honors.
Led by a prancing scarlet devil the
Graduation Day procession took possession
of the streets. Later on, Chancellor Saw
shouted the happy news of the most muni-
ficent bequest made to any Australian IJni.
The Hackett estate had been wound up, and
the residue falling to Perth’s Uni. will be
well over £500,000. Everybody cheered the
prospect of scrapping the Irwin-street tin-
ware and migrating to modern buildings at
Crawley. In the evening the students don-
ned coat-tails and dancing-slippers for their
return to Government House ballroom, where
their annual hop was staged.
Iu 1919 a daughter of Harry Boan, the
Westralian Anthony Hordern, married Lord
Athlumney, an Irish peer. Now Veronica,
second daughter of S’James; Connolly,
sometime Colonial Secretary and Agent-
General, is to become the wife of the Hon.
John Betliell, son and heir of Lord Bethell.
Veronica, a pretty girl, was born on the
East Coolgardie goldfields when her father
was a contractor there.
Here is Airs. Theo Pelloe, artist, writer
and sportswoman. Her pen and color-box
created a well-known book on “Wild Flowers
of Western Australia,” and they are now put-
ting the final
touches to a
similar work
on orchids. Her
home is filled
with colorful
paintings—she
paints for the
love of the
thing and re-
fuses to .sell a
picture or hold
an exhibition.
Celebrities who
visit the State
ask to meet
“the wild-
flower lady,”
and Lady
Burnham car-
ried her off for
a week’s tour
a deux.' Mrs.
Pe 11 o e is a
straight shot
and a fine horsewoman, and has carried off
scores of prizes for equestrian events.
SOU TII AU STB ALI A.
Adelaide.
The Yorks won’t any more be in
doubt about the lineaments of the Aus-
tralian flag. Adelaide got one made that
spread right across King William-street—
hanging lengthwise at that —and stuck it in
front of the Town Hall. Every square
inch within 30ft. of the line of pro-
cession was filled with loyalty, and there
was nothing the matter with the cheers. Dis-
embarked at the Town Hall, the party was
steered to a dais, where Mayor Bruce held
out an address of welcome attired- —later on
—in a cloak of the most beautiful timbers
this State can produce. Then, after those
who had to be presented had been presented,
Pauline Bruce, the Mayor’s little daughter,
came forward with a set of dinkum Aussie
picture-blocks for little ’Liz’beth who was
left at home; and the Duchess smiled
brightly and wished, doubtless, since women
are only human even after they become
princesses, that she could take the little
parcel home straightaway.
The next item didn’t do much to relieve
home-sickness. It was a parade of Girl
Guides and Boy Scouts —30,000 of them, all
with faces bright and clean and shoes im-
maculate. The Duke had put on his Boy
Scout regalia and his little spouse had
assumed the navy blue of the Guides. Two
small atoms were drafted out of the mob for
presentation—Scout Colbig, who swam out
to a pal in the Port River and saved
him, and the Governor’s small chick
Alvide, who belongs to a Guide troop that
recently won a competition.
At night the royal two had to meet a
select few at dinner at Government House,
but mum and dad and the kids went up town
and saw the illuminations and enjoyed them-
selves no end. Next day, being Sunday, the
visitors supported the Faith of which George
is Defender by attendance at St. Peter’s
Cathedral. But human nature has its limits,
and in the afternoon the Duke let himself
go and played three hard sets of tennis on
the Government House court. Monday was
a round of soldiers’ hospitals, with a look-in
at the Pv.S.A. headquarters.
Summer gave a backward kick on the night
of St. Mark’s College dance, but the Float-
ing Palais is a cool spot, and punkahs were
set swinging. Mrs. Hew Giles, all opal-
escent sequins; Mrs. S. R. Burston, in black
and silver with a dash of scarlet; and Mrs.
11. C. Nutt, in flame georgette, organised the
arrangements, and dancing Adelaide rallied
to make the affair the best the college has
had.
The South Australian Society of Arts
lias staged its autumn exhibition with Dr.
R. S. Rogers to open it and say a word or
rwo about its approaching seventieth birth-
day. The still-life prize went to Jessamine
Buxton.
If the TattersalFs Cup attendance be any
prophecy the Adelaide Cup meeting will be
crowded. Every inch of the lawns and
stands at Victoria Park was packed, with
femininity, largely tweed-clad, well to the
fore. Lady. Bridges, in fawn tweed with a
wine-colored hat, brought with her Mrs.
Armstrong, all in blue.

E.F.W.: Far too 10ng... .L.R.8.: “Com-
ing Home” is going there. .. .C.P.R.: Part of the art
of story-writing is in the method of conveying tech-
nical information it is necessary for the reader to
know. The schoolmaster stylo is deadly.. . .Gordon Mac:
Nothing in the chronicle as presented; but you ought
to be able to write personal pars.... Alma M.: The
person with a message is seldom a poet. ...D.T.M.A.:
Drearily told ;if a fact, worth a par... .P.A.T.: Poor;

is one of the “Flowers” born to blush unseen..,.

most men’s hospitality is a little Scotch.... ltoss M.:
The incident is closed.... Sauerkraut: It’s even
hard to get into “Answers”... .Ivy G.: Ail weak....
A.C.L.: It was barbarous to shoot the swan; but it
doesn’t make a story... .G.A.B. (M.L.) : Thanks;
but The Bulletin lets its contents speak for them-
selves. . . .Will Ci (M.L.) : Poor girl! Poor stuff. .. .
W.M.C.: You use a form which should prevent that
joggy sensation... .G.A.S.: “He watched her through
the widow.” Thin lady evidently... .Midge B.:
Merry verse; but not enough point. .. .J'.R.L.: Some
of your rhymes are wonderful:—
Paddy the Pole is a wonderful genius
Whose marvellous powers give him quite a lien on us;
He recently played for the Governor-General,
Who has not much time for such shows so ephemeral.
.... L.R.W.: Mere commonplace, though nicely
rhymed. . . : No good putting cheap jokes into
verse... .M.J.N.: Such patriotic hymns are usually
terrible... .G.N.: Slight.... J.E.S.: Might have had
point 30 years ago. .. .H.N.S.: Just missed....
W.H.L.: Still a long way off Harold C.: All
lamentable... .L.F.Y.: Even the worst of darned fools
would have counted the pack after such repeated
failures... .R.W.K.: Echoes a Dennis verse too loudly.

tion that there are thieves in He 11.... Eric H. M.:
The verse sauce isn’t piquant enough to justify the
rehash. .. .P.N.M.: They lack, real feeling. .. .Fred F.:
That transference of leprosy by touch is against modern
knowledge of the disease... .J.R.D.: Dissertation on
the law of gravity has too much gravity.... C.A.W.:
Crippled verse put out of its misery.... C.R.F.: And
it was “intended to be humorous” !. . . .Fred V.: The
lady might find it interesting. .. .A.E. (East Melb.) :
Tt’s a wild wandering rather than a yarn. . . .F.L.S.:
The fatal osculation again:—
Yet in the latest breath he drew,
When all his sense was growing weak,
He felt the thrill of love’s sweet power.
The lady kissed him on the cheek
And he was dead in half an hour.
.... E.A.R.: No place for that kind of descriptive
article... .Chas L. S.: Take a look at “Dawn” by
daylight, and count the errors—-“light-delight,” for
a start.... Henry H.: That free verse flows prosaic-
ally in the garden of 10ve... .H.W.8.: One, at least,
of the Casey yarns was told before... .Sepha R.: Too
late in any case. ... A.G.-J.: Your April arrived too
late. .F.M.: The story gets lost at the end. Try
to improve it. .. . J.R.L.: This couplet delighted our
soul :
He’ll get pinched some day when at crook things
he’ll nibble,
Which is quite in his way, for he’s incorrigible.
. ...A.M.M.: Rather well done; but overwrought
tragedy.... Q. Cumber: Too slight... .H.W.S.: You
can write , verse ; that stilted amorous style is out of
date.... John M.: All matter used is paid for; cut
out, mark with date and page of appearance, and
forward to accountant. Story missed narrowly....
Bis N.: Too much sugar in your “Cup of Tea.”
. ...M.B. (Randwick) : “The Seeker” fails in the
quest for print.... D.8.0’C.: Crude... .Pat: Par-
ticularly admired the rhyme “Pluvius—-roof on us”... .
F.T.8.: You go a very roundabout way to kill the man
| with heart trouble. .. .A.B. (Blacktown) : Story
hops about like a flea; and it lacks a decisive bite.
....The Bear: Your verses are, as you put it, “like
the voices of choristers gently annulled.” Write in
ink, anyway... .N.K.E.: Appalling... .Cam D.:
“Steak” is too raw. .. .G.R.M.: The story improved,
and the handwriting deteriorated, until, just as the
yarn began to be interesting, it became indecipher-
able... .A.H.T.: The murderer -who wept at the
smell of a carnation moves us n0t....D.8. (Melb.):
“Mist” is the sort of thing that never will be....
H.A.L.: No story.... A.E.W.: It’s what you suspected
—dull... .E.M.8.: Why don’t you tell your own story ?
Why complicate matters, including punctuation, by
putting it into the mouth of somebody else "!....
N.S.M.: Same to you. And we rather liked Bandy,
t 00.... .W.T.M.: Nothing in “Robin”. .. .McG.:
“Turning” is too thin... .L.D.1.: Yes; send claim to
accountant, identifying the par. .. .Pesca: Persevere. A
nan who can find a rhyme for “aeousticon” deserves
a word of encouragement.... J.McC.: Can’t swallow
Thelma. .. .R.S.A.: Saw it coming from afar....
L.F.Y.: “Competition” hopelessly long-winded. That’s
your besetting sin. .. .Jim D.: No good. If you’ve
picked up any not generally known wrinkle about
getting rid of rabbits, that’s what we want —not
long screeds about generalities... .A.P.D.: (1) The
Commonwealth has a very robust external interest
bill. At June, 30, 1926, it was paying £7,949,760
p.a. in London and in New York; total
£8,720,335. Some of the money was re-lent to the
States, but statistics say very little about what
interest the Commonwealth collects from its sons.
(2) The municipal and private interest bill abroad
is large, but indefinite. The official estimate, now
a year old, puts the annual bill payable abroad for
interest and “services” (use of ships, etc.), at about
£30,000,000 a year, and it is larger n0w....
N.K.C.: Good if you had been more careful to
tell us what the effects were.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
D.N.: Your “art” is beyond redemption. . . .C.R.H.:
An untidy pair.... H.W.T.: Tramcar joke too paro-
chial; others weak... .8.H.: Your free-and-easy style
won’t carry you far. .. .N.S.S.: Drunk on the ’phone

planted on the Labor M.L.A.’s chin was unavailing.

THE INKY WAY.
Hobart’s venerable Mercury, which has been
running since the days when the Speck was
labelled Van Diemen's Land, may change
hands. The directors the other dav had a
chat with an emissary from the Melbourne
Herald.
“Old Sub”: Outside those enterprising
souls who cross over to the managerial or
ad-canvassing side or become proprietors 1
only heard of one real Inky Wayfarer who
died rich. His name doesn’t matter. He
left £5OOO in his will, the fruit of a life of
untiring industry and devotion to duty,
coupled with strict economy and £499!) left
him by a rich uncle the week before his death.
“E. Mudliook” : David Low was associated
with at least one remarkably short-lived
venture before he left his native Maoriland.
When I first met him lie was on the Christ-
church Spectator, and had just been com-
missioned to supply the illustrations for the
first number of the New Zealand Mirror
Magazine. Unfortunately for all concerned,
the first number of this publication was also
the last. Every one of the 28 headings and
illustrations, including that on the cover, w r as
drawn by Low. I have tried hard to pro-
cure a copy since the artist became famous,
but without any luck.
Gordon Harris, one of the Speck’s most
popular and successful State-school teachers,
has pulled out from his big Hobart suburban
school to join the staff of the North-Western
Advocate —the prosperous Burnie daily
which the family has conducted very suc-
cessfully for donkeys’ years.
“Knib” : Mrs. M. K. Armstrong, just laid
to rest in Kyneton (Vic.) cemetery, was the
widow of the founder of the Kyneton
Guardian. The paper is still in the family,
and the deceased lady, who was in her 87th
year, was associated with it for more than half
a century. It was a prosperous bi-weekly
when Ned Kelly and his band of outlaws
were providing columns of copy in ’79 and
”80. Mrs. Armstrong helped to bring up a
family of nine children.
“Gan” : Melbourne Punch, which is now
incorporated with Table Talk (the opera-
tion suggesting a mouse swallowing an
elephant), ran a queer old office in the days
of the McKinleys. Alec, who recently died
at the age of 79, was the proprietor, and
brother Jimmie the editor. Both were
really kindly men, and Punch was by no
means a bad paper to work for, though the
rates were only 15s. a column. Ted Dyson
and Edmund Finn were the star writers in
its palmy days ; but during its long career,
beginning in the ’seventies under the Me-
Kinleys, until it was bought by the Wool-top
Hughes party and later by the Herald, most
Melbourne scribes might be numbered among
its contributors. A curious rule of the office
was that no reviews were ever to be paid for;
they were assigned to constant contributors,
perhaps as an honor.
“John Drayman” : Though the landing of
the Yorks on April 16 rather upset Hobart's
equilibrium and caused quite a number of
responsible citizens to forget appointments, a
fine houseful of printing-trade identities of
the village gathered to wisn many happy
returns to 80-year-old foreman-printer Wil-
liam John McWilliams, who holds the Speck’s
long-distance record in the trade. He still
toddles blithely to his daily toil at the
Mercury office, as he has been doing for 64
years. In the process lie has covered 58.901
miles 3 furlongs and 100yds., and declares
that' he has enjoyed every step of tlie
journey.
“Barley Mow”: In the early days Mel-
bourne inns were sometimes wont to adver-
tise their attractions in doggerel. In the
Port Phillip Gazette, 80 years ago, appeared
the account of the doping and “lambing-
down” of a busliman in a tavern which had
some pretensions to class. A rival pub, the
Travellers’ Best, promptly seized on the
episode to announce :
Here may the weary bushman rest from toil.
Fearing no lurking demon in his glass ;
No greedy sharpers, watchful for the spoil
Of honest labor, thro’ these portals pass.
In those halcyon days, one presumes, there
was no plug of tobacco deep down in the
beer-barrel, and the froth on the top of the
glass did not consist of compressed air.
“Old Nib”: Someone asks whether (D
the ArguS opened a fund to pay Richard
Speight’s law exes, when he lost his libel
suit (claim for £25.000 damages) again-:
the Age in 1894, and whether (2) the Age
made a public appeal for its own costs.
No open public appeal was made for Speight,
though Syme’s counsel hinted that Speight
was supported “by a faction and a cause,
and Syme’s biographer, Ambrose Pratt, says
the Conservative party subsidised Speight
to fight Syme. The Age made no public
or private appeal. Pratt says the case cost
£50.000, and if Syme had lost it would have
cost him £lOO,OOO, as well as the amount
of the damages. He relates that when
Speight’s other creditors (Syme, in respect
of costs, was the chief creditor) wore press-
ing him. Syme, through E. L. Zox. sent
Speight a cheque for £lOO to help him go
to Westralia. Speight called and thanked
Syme, and Syme, shaking hands, said, "L
was a good fight.”
“Oxmead”: The quaintest newspaper I
ever saw was published on a bundle of survey
maps. At Cue (W.A.) in ’93. Alex. Living-
stone, the pioneer of journalism on the Mur-
chison, ran short of material on which h
print his weekly contribution to the world s
literature owing to the delay of teams on
the road. He went desperately nosing
around the settlement and finally found in the
mining-registrar’s office a few hundred sheet*
on which the first claims on the field had been
charted by the Government printing depart-
ment in Perth. The information in these being
regarded as obsolete, “Livvy” was allowed 1
utilise the forms as newsprint. He published
the reading matter of his next issue on tin
clear backs of his find, and the ads on tin
occupied side, and the latter were hardly more
illegible than usual in their cartographic sur-
roundings. The early-day mining population
of Westralia paid sixpence cheerfully for an:>
thing resembling a local newspaper even
when, as somebody once remarked. U lookc
as if it might have been “inked with
cart-grease and printed on a mangle.’

r security from
disastrous fires
For many years fire appliances capable
of dealing with fires of an ordinary nature,
such as m ght occur in offices, have been
in general use, but the widespread in-
troduction of petrol and fuel oil saw the
advent of a fire risk demanding a new
extinguishing medium which would, in
addition, be adequate for dealing with
fires involving inflammable liquids. After
lengthy research, the last decade saw the
introduction of the FOAMITE method
of Fire Protection with portable equip-
ment and fixed installations producing a
fire extinguishing medium (Firefoam)
which met this demand.
Fiercely blazing petrol, paint, tar
which defy other extinguishing methods
—are easily smothered under Firefoam.
Ordinary fires die instantly. The foam
not only puts out the fire but prevents re-
ignition.

HINTS FOR THE FARM.
•‘Glenfield”: How often a bran-bag is seen
under the collar to relieve the sore shoul-
ders which in 19 out of 20 cases are due
to ignorance or carelessness! Too much
importance cannot be given to seeing that
the collar is of the right size, and that it
tits snugly on the shoulders, with sufficient
room for the hand to pass between the bot-
tom of the collar and the neck. Just as
important is it to see that the liames lit
tinnly around the collar, with the hooks
lying well above the point of the shoulders.
Sores can be caused by loosely-strapped
liames on a well-fitting collar jf the hooks sag
over the points of the shoulder.
“P.C.”: For a bolting pony (B. 14/4/’27)
try this simple remedy: Full the reins
through the rings on the bit and buckle on
where the traces are joined to the hames.
I don’t know whether it causes the pony any
pain, but I do know that it causes the brute
to wait until he is told to go.
“J.D.C.”: When drafting woolly sheep they
frequently jam in the entrance to the race.
The use of rollers is not altogether a remedy,
but will reduce the trouble. Take a round
piece of tough wood about 2ft. long and 4in.
diameter, drill a hole straight down the centre
longitudinally with an ineh-and-a-quarter
auger, slip a threequarter-incli bar of steel
or iron through the bore to project about two
inches at each end, and fix the projecting ends
solidly in a horizontal rail top and bottom.
These rollers are sometimes placed all the way
along the race, but if three or four are placed
on each side where the jambs converge they
will assist the sheep to struggle through.
“Bidgee”: A system of “duckboards” is
very useful for watering sheep at a boggy
tank. Make a few light gratings similar to
the floor of a sheep-pen in a woolslied, about
3ft. wide and any convenient length—6ft. is
handy. Place them end to end at the edge
of the water with a light stake in front to
prevent them slipping in. They are easily
lifted or put further in as the water recedes,
and will allow any number of sheep to drink
without bogging. Sheep may be a bit shy at
first, but if the rest of the tank is fenced off
they learn to use the gratings in a very short
time.
LAMB-MARKING RECORDS.
“L 37”: "J.D.C.” (B. 31/3/’27), re lamb-
marking, says the man who cannot knife 1000
lambs an hour does not know his job. I
have been at it many years, and I cannot
do it, and I do not think “J.D.C.” can find
the man who can.
"Saaedi”: “J.D.C.” calculates that on a
basis of one second and a half for a ewe, and
six seconds for a ram, an expert marker
should be able to doctor 1000 lambs in an
hour. With the average ram lamb, six seconds
would suffice, but one strikes a good few
snags that will take a lot. longer. The best
I have done was 2000 in of hours, and even
then one of the catchers reckoned I was
murdering them instead of marking them.
Lamb-marking records aren’t worth much
anyway, unless the record breaker can certify
that the casualties after marking weren’t
above the average.
WINDMILLS.
Windmills had a great testing at the
Sydney Show, and some at least of them
came through the cyclone wonderfully well.
The most; interesting exhibit in this section
was the Flavin, totally different in design
from that of any other on the ground. The
rotor has the appearance of three vertical
troughs built around a vertical spindle. These
troughs are so placed that the mill is turned
by wind from any direction. A plate disc
fastens the troughs at top and bottom. Ball-
bearings are fitted, and this all makes for
lightness and durability. A double opposite
crank makes it possible for two pumps to be
worked at the one time from the one gear-box.
The mill is fitted with a hand-brake, and
can be stopped when desired. This type of
windmill has done away with any overhang,
which, of course, has to be in the other types.
In the gale at the Show Ground, during
which the wind velocity reached 64 m.p.h.,
no damage was done to this mill. When this
Page examined it on the Tuesday morning
h looked storm-proof. A substantial build-
ing within 30 feet of it was blown and
mattered to pieces.
Another that came through well was made
by the Southern Cross Windmill Co., of
St. Peters —the largest mill on the ground:
-6ft. diameter on a 45ft. tower. It had a
double-rimmed wind-wheel, and is so well
governed that during the cyclone it was
regulated to turn as if a five-mile wind was
blowing. So far as this Page could see, it
didn’t lose a part.
FARMERS' EVENINGS.
“E.S.S.” : Husking competitions used to be
popular in maize-growing districts of north-
east N. S. Wales. In 1924 contests for the
corn-husking championship of the Clarence
River were revived at the Maclean Show.
Besides the show attraction, competitions
were held in many barns on the Clarence and
Richmond. A group of farmers about the
neighborhood of Woram got through many
a big heap of cobs in that way on winter
nights. They met at a barn after tea, and
bad a 3000-cob race for the championship.
N'ext night they met at another barn, and so
nn. In that way every man did his best
for bis neighbor, and the race and the
company made an interesting evening of a
tiresome job. Sometimes there was a pound
of tobacco for the fastest busker at the end
of the season, but generally the farmers were
satisfied with the honor of winning—and
setting their corn undressed in a pleasant
way.
At other times, instead of racing, they
assembled for a companionable evening, doing
die round of three or four neighboring barns
about once a week. The men smoked and
yarned and husked, and now and again one
sang a song. The women busked and gos-
siped. The boys and girls were usually
grouped together, but sometimes, when there
seemed to be too much prattling and play-
ing behind the piling husks, they were
separated in the interests of the industry.
WATTLE-GROWING.
“S.. Ryder” : The unsatisfactory position
which has developed with regard to tanning
material in Australia has often been com-
mented on, but comment is about all it gets.
As a matter of fact, there is no more payable
proposition in the country than the culture
of the indigenous wattle, and it is one that
ought to appeal to most Australians, as it
takes little to start a plantation and little
to keep it going afterwards, provided the
right district is chosen.
Around Twofold Bay (N.S.W.) wattle-
springs up all over the land as soon as
the forest trees are ringed, and is then left
to battle for itself against bracken fern and
the seedlings and suckers of other growths.
In its preparation for market the methotl
used 50 years ago still survives. The dried
bundles are fastened to a block with a chain
and lever and chopped up with an axe, then
rammed into bags by hand. A hard, slow,
dusty and heart-breaking job !
From Twofold Bay to beyond the Vic-
torian border —a district served by the Illa-
warra Co.’s boats —the species which finds
the. most ready sale flourishes, and it fetches
to]) prices on the Sydney market. In that
district it never requires planting. When
once the big eucalypts are killed, the wattle
seed already on the ground germinates, and,
given the least chance, spreads all over the
land. If other growths are kept down for
a year or two, the wattle will take complete
charge and flourish exceedingly. As the
larger trees are stripped, young ones come
on, and keep coming on for a man’s life-
time. When the trees run out the land is
left clean.
There are several good tannin-yielding
wattles. South Australia has probably the
best, Acacia pycnantha, the golden wattle.
On the N.S.W. South Coast, of which I
have written, Acacia decurrens (the feathery-
leaved wattle) is the indigenous variety; and
it stands second to the golden wattle, with
Mollis film a (the green wattle) to keep it
company. “Best Southern chopped,” as they
call it on the Sydney market, is worth
£l3 10s. per ton.
FRUIT-TREE PESTS.
“Rene”: My apple-trees got the woolly
blight, and I found greasing the. affected
spots with ordinary household dripping quite
freed them. Whenever a new spot appeared
it was promptly greased, and soon there
was no more trouble. Both Granny Smiths
and Rome Beauties were treated. We let
our place for IS months and the trees were
neglected; yet there is now no sign of woolly
blight on the Grannies, and very little on
the Rome Beauties.
But I would be glad to know of a reliable
treatment for borers in peach- and plum-
trees. I have just lost two fine Briggs Red
May peaches through them.
“Pick” : When a fruit-tree regularly fails
to do credit to the orchard an iron spike
driven into its trunk often brings about the
production of a crop, notwithstanding all
the theorists. A Central Tilba (N.S.W.)
orcliardist had two flourishing fig-trees that
consistently dropped their fruit when it was
half-grown. Disgustedly the owner, to use
one of the trees as a clothes-line post, drove
into its trunk a rusty iron bolt. The next
summer that tree ripened an overload of
fruit, while the other was sheddiug its half-
grown figs as usual. A couple of old bolts
were used on the second tree, and since
then both have annually done ample duty.
Several other slackers in the same orchard
have since undergone the iron tonic with
equally beneficial results.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: It is common belief
among stock-breeders that a cow carries a
male calf longer than nine months, whereas
a heifer is not, as a rule, carried the full
time. It is not the rule. I have known cases
in which the bull-calves were ahead of the
heifers; I have also known female calves
to be a week late. I remember one instance
in which two milkers were put in calf on
the same day by a Jersey bull, and there
was a difference of a week between the dates
of delivery: the cow that got in first pro-
duced twin-lieifers, the other calf being also
a female.

“Bill Pinn”: Leaving tools all day in the

spoils the temper of the steel. Although
that is a common belief, it has no founda-
tion in fact. To temper steel, it is first
made red-hot and plunged in water till cool.
It is then slowly reheated. The metal first
shows a pale straw color, and changes to
dark straw, then to pale blue, and to dark
blue and purple. Wood-cutting tools are
usually cooled out on the appearance of the
darker blue shades, which require between
•300 and 400 degrees of heat. The sun’s
rays could not bring a tool to that point
and so affect the temper.
“Firefly”: In evidence before the N.S.W.
Agricultural Select Committee, 1021, the
biologist, Department of Agriculture, esti-
mated the annual loss to Australia in maize,
oats, wheat, potatoes and barley through
insect and fungus pests to be about
£6,000,000. Flag smut alone, the most seri-
ous disease in the N.S.W. wheat belt, was
responsible for a loss of approximately two
million bushels of wheat in N.S.W. in the
1925 season. Some varieties of wheat are
less susceptible to flag smut than others.
The figures show the necessity of finding
out what those varieties are in each district;
for it is possible that the most resistant
variety in one district is not the most re-
sistant in all others.
* * * *
“T.J.”: “J.D.C.” (B. 14/4/’27) is right
in the main respecting the advantages to be
derived through pumping water for stock
instead of giving them free access to open
tanks, but soakage is often less in the latter
case. The traffic to the water’s edge causes
the batters to set like concrete, given suit-
able soil, so that the tank holds better. I
have seen a tank untouched by stock dry
up solely through soakage and evaporation
two months in advance of another excava-
tion of similar size at which 2000 sheep
were watering, both boles being tilled at the
same time and subject to the same climatic
conditions.

The “Cradle Snatchers,” or the feminine
section of them, are three well-preserved
women, just slipping into the forties, who
hire three young men. at 2000 dollars a
head, to inflame the jealousy of their flapper-
chasing husbands by acting as the neglected
wives’ cavaliers. Kitty Ladd is the first to
hit on this method of bringing an erring
spouse to liis senses, and when she intro-
duces her bashful young “cake-eater,” Henry
Win ton , to her friends they are quite in-
trigued by the notion and Henry is asked
to engage two of his college pals for a
similar job. Complications and mirth of
a rich smoking-room flavor are provided
when the extras turn up at the Ladds’ sum-
mer bungalow with the situation only half
explained to them, and jump to the conclu-
sion that it is real love-making the women
want. Things begin to move rapidly when
the three husbands suddenly break in upon
the scene. They are supposed to he away
on a shooting excursion; but their apple-
cart is upset by the arrival of the three
flappers they were faking to a jollification
at an all-night cabaret —-the party had dropped
in to pick up some champagne kept at
the bungalow—and in the upshot il is
understood that the philanderers have been
taught tlieir lesson.
Almost as funny as the show itself, which
opened at the Criterion on Saturday, was
the aspect of one critic who, with a face
of lofty disapproval, sat in the d.c. sternly
declining to smile while everyone else was
rocking with laughter. The play has no
literary value, and little more stagecraft than
a well-arranged revue, but its humorous
appeal is undoubted, and if there are hits in
the dialogue that would have shocked a by-
gone generation the thin ice is always skated
over swiftly and the improprieties, such as
they are, are all on the surface. There is
no hint that the philandering of the hus-
bands is more than a light foolishness, and
one of the hired gallants falls in love with
a girl who is the niece of liis pretended
inamorata, while another takes on the hand-
somely-paid job as a means of making things
easier for himself and his real sweetheart.
The chief honors go to Bertha Belmore,
who, as the timorous matron, Ethel Drake,
is dragged into the escapade somewhat re-
luctantly and with all her conventionality
protesting. Admirable contrasts to her are
supplied by the Kitty Ladd of Jessamine
Newcombe and the Susan Martin, “whose
amorous impulses are not exactly anaemic,”
of Olive Sloane. The husbands are briskly
played by Arthur Cornell, Sidney Stirling
(both local mummers) and Herbert Bel-
more. Fred Conyngham is excellent as the
shy Henry Win ton; but the best of the
three young men is Maury Tuckerman, who
presents an Oscar Nordholm awkward and
with no enthusiasm for his part, conscien-
tiously trying to give full value for the
money as a hired lover. Jack Halloran as
the third youth, Jose Yallergo, gets a big
round for liis best scene, but. is occasionally
more awkward than his part requires; and,
while Lucille Lisle is dainty enough as the
girl who distracts Henry’s eye from its
proper duty, the rest of the cast is moderate.
“Cradle Snatchers” will probably have a
long run, even although mention is being
made of a future occupancy of the Criterion
by “The Ghost Train.”
On Saturday (May 14) the expensive
fiddle of Heifetz is to thrill the echoes of the
Sydney Town Hall; there, are six concerts
announced and the management is smiling
contentedly over the advance booking. A
more imminent event is the coming of “Tip
Toes/’ which steps into Her Majesty’s
Theatre on Saturday next. Among the fun-
makers, besides some new stars, are Gus
Bluett, Olsen and Johnson. Like the last
pair, Gerardo and Enid Adair, the quaint
dancers of the show, have been given a pre-
liminary airing at the Tivoli. The dispos-
sessed “Fasquita” will remove on that night
to the Royal, at which Nellie Stewart,
who brings “Sweet Nell of Old Drury” to
an end to-morrow night, gives this after-
noon (Thursday) a “professional matinee.”
At the Palace Theatre “Six-Cylinder Love”
is running smoothly. It will be “Sunny’s”
80th birthday on Saturday night. The lady
from Brazil still cavorts on the stage of the
Grand Opera House, but the co. has a new
play in hard rehearsal, which means that
“Charley’s Aunt” is shortly to finish. “Get-
ting Gertie’s Garter” is the exhilarating title
of the impending venture. Wirtlis’ has given,
a shuffle to its programme whilst still re-
taining all the trick-taking cards in the pack.
Alexander Carr, who was the original Perl-
nmttcr, placidly appeared at Sydney Tivoli on
Monday despite doctor’s orders. Some of the
songs had to he excised from his programme,
but the sample sketches he gave made this
Showman eager for more. His excellent
delivery and manipulation of English, Scot-
tish and Jewish accents, delightfully free
from the exaggeration usual on the Vaude-
ville stage, make up for the sob-story nature
uf his sketches. Through a programme error
some credit that should have been given to
Kvans and Perez last week went astray.
This pair is providing one of the most sensa-
tional turns on the Tivoli stage, or, to put it
more correctly, off it. One partner, lying on
his back on a temporary stage in front of the
proscenium, supports on the soles of his feet
a huge ladder reaching above the height of
the gallery, at the top end of which tin-
other does hair-raising tricks.
Fuller’s continues to be mostly Stiffy aud
Mo, with an interlarding of songs by Alec
Kellaway—“Pale Moon,” sung with a back-
ground of six girls in Red Indian array, is
particularly effective —-the Charleston Sym-
phony Band and sundry other items. The
revue form, in so far as it eliminates the
dreariness of curtain falls, is a distinct im-
provement on the old method of delivering
vaudeville goods.
“The Volga Boatman” takes two hours
and three-quarters to unroll itself at the
Crystal Palace; it is questionable whether
the human eye can take in so much without
fatigue and inattention. The picture, how-
ever. is a thing of photographic beauty. Like
a living frieze the toilers draw the heavy
barge from scene to scene, a leit-motif that
runs through the sensational drama. The
final scenes show the aristocrats of Russia,
beautiful women in costly dresses, forced by
the revolution to harness themselves to the
ropes of the barge crowded by drunken Bol-
sheviks. Though the picture drags heavily
after the brilliance of the opening, and the
concluding action might be considerably
shortened, Cecil de Mille merits praise for
his sincere efforts to work out the technique
of this new art. The characters are well
chosen.
The use of the famous Benda masks is
the only outstanding novelty in a wild and
whirling crook drama entitled “The Perfect
Sap,” now to be seen at Hoyt’s and the.
Strand. These masks are warranted to

transform the most insignificant features
into things of grace and beauty. They were
shown some years ago at Sydney Tivoli by
a dancer, and their classic loveliness left
an indelible impression. It is a pity that
the innovation has not been put to more
artistic uses than in “The Perfect Sap,”
which is a crude jumble of crooks, detectives,
lights and diamonds.
Some Pretty Pictures and an Antique :
The exhibition of the Women Painters’ Society at
the gallery of the Education Department leaves an
impression, of prettiness rather than effectiveness.
The council of the society got Sid Long- to assist
in the work of selection; he is credited with having
pruned with an unchivalrous sternness, but ho was
unable to put into the show the strength that it
lacks. This is not to say that 1 hero is not a good
deal of appealing work; it is particularly noticeable
in the water-color section. “A Backwater on the
Murrumbidgee” displays Alice Norton in a reposeful
mood, Gladys Owen has a profitable-looking “Hay-
field,” and Laura Booth, whose “Through the Trees”
displays admirably treated shadows, Winifred Caddy
and Violet Bowring all appear to advantage. “Early
Morning, Cronulla,” is conspicuous amongst the oils;
the artist, Mrs. Hedley Parsons, lias some good
water-colors also. Ethel Stephens handles a bowl
of Iceland-poppies skilfully, but fails in the treat-
ment of light effects upon a nude figure. Weakness
in draughtsmanship is too common in the oils, but
there is vigor in the “Wind and Rain” of Daisy
Middleton, and merit is shown by E. M. Simpson,
Edith M. Toms (“Newport Beach”) and Amy Vale,
whilst some work interesting in method is supplied

The founders of the Collectors and Connoisseurs’
Society, who hope to establish an Art Museum in
Sydney, have launched their first show ; it is housed
in Farmer’s Gallery, where Tom Mutch, Minister for
Education, made congratulatory remarks and rather
vague promises at the opening on Monday. Already
the enthusiasts have collected exhibits to the value
of over £2OOO, and the interest is emphasised by
the well-informed descriptions carded against each
exhibit. Here are Oriental bronzes and brasses,
Damascene ware, fins Malay silver-work, Chinese
pottery, porcelain from all the world, lacquer-work
and carvings in jade, specimens of lace and samples
of Japanese artistry. After the exhibition is over
the contents are to be lent to the Technological
Museum until the members of the society fulfil their
objective of securing a museum of their own.
Eirene Mort has grabbed Time by the forelock
with a topical exhibit of pencil sketches of Canberra,
shown at the Painter-Etchers’ Gallery, Callaghan
House, Georg-e-street. Historically, these sketches will
become intensely interesting; they have some value
also as sympathetically worked pictures.
** * *
In “The Ringer,” at Melbourne Royal,
Edgar Wallace, a well-known author of six-
shilling shockers, has thought up for the
stage a pretty poor and pretty transparent
spoof melodrama. “The Ringer” is a pious
sort of crook who, as a flying officer in the
war, kills Germans in the cause of peace,
and, as a civilian murderer in times of peace,
never knocks a fellow man on the head save
in the cause of righteousness. After tem-
porary retirement in Australia, he returns
to London to execute a notorious wealthy
fence, who takes the proceeds of burglaries,
betrays the burglars to the police and shows
more than a friendly interest in the burglars’
wives while the burglars are doing time. This
person “The Ringer” kills in the presence of
the stupidest collection of police officers in
the history of the force; otherwise it would
be clearly impossible for him to escape.
With his self-sacrificing passion for admini-
stering first aid to sickly plays, Maurice
Moscovitch wastes his distinguished talents
on the wicked fence. Patric Curwen, brought
specially from England for the purpose,
plays the Scotch medico shrewdly and with
humor. Nat Madison pursues his haggard
way through the rfde of a pale Cockney
pimp. George Blunt as a station sergeant-
supplies the best passage in comedy of his
long career, and A. Sarnor, R. Newson and
Hal Percy, police officers, discharge their
stage duties passing well. None of the
ladies matter.
Two kisses bestowed by two beaming ®i r l.
on two shining young men commence
business of the evening at Melb. Athene,,,
where Ihe Dntair Sex” is under discussion'
at present. A divorce-court lawyer an cl,
ot two ot the principals, sees in these oscu-
lations the seeds of disaster, and bv an elaff,
rate series of pretences seeks to frighten
the couple back to the path of marital air.
rectness. An plla podrida of misunderstaml-
ingff resolves itself miraculously into a tasty
dish of reconciliations before the final curtail,
cuts off the debate. This farce-comedv l
divertmgly written, and the small cast, mosi
or whom were here previously with ‘‘The
Sport of Kings,” carry their portfolios much
more dcservingly than the average State
Ministry. Zillah Bateman is prepossessim:
as the young wife and Norman Carter is en-
tertaining as her kissing partner. Frank
Bradley meddles mirthfully as the inter-
fering lawyer.
"The Green Hat” was given its first Aus-
tralian airing at Melbourne King’s on
Saturday night. The much-padded, unsav-
ory novel is boiled down to four compara
tively short acts, of which the second is the
most, unhealthy. The slim Judith Anderson
ot the hard staccato delivery is spasmodically
excellent as Iris and gets some fine work
into her Ophelia-like entrance in the Ims
pital scene. George Baxter, as the parent-
ridden cad Napier Uarpenden, begins badlj
on a difficult role, but warms up consider
ably as he progresses. The finest bit of
realism of the evening is furnished by Bar-
rie Livesey as the dissipated Gerald March,
brother of Iris. Wallis Clark supplies cheerv
relief as the brusque medico, Dr. Conrad
Masters. The part of Venice, the beautiful
local lass who marries Napier, is filled by
Olga Lee, the possessor of a ’Murkan accent
quaintly out of place on the lips of an
English maiden. The long cast includes
a trio of flappers much nicer than their
acting and some very charming sisters of
charity. Leon Gordon has staged the piece
well—but it is a question whether it was
worth staging.

AH other events will be o’ershadowed in
Melbourne on Saturday by boatrace night at
Il is Majesty s, where " Rose Marie” is on
the eve of her 400th Australian showing,
"t’ossum Paddock” is providing a fair cry
of laughter at the Palace, and at tin, Princess
Muriel Starr continues to receive more
divorces than she earns. The scene has changed
at the Bijou from the sparkle of revue to the
glamor and miracles of ancient India, which
provides a background for some striking
sleight-of-liead by Arthur Buckley, an Aus-
tralian magician who lias won fame abroad.
Large tallies of Red Indians are being
nightly slaughtered by Ken Maynard in “The
Overland Stage” at Hoyt’s Melbourne house
this week, though there seems no immediate
danger of the hero being put out of
action for want of fresh material. Mati
Moore is spending “Three Weeks in Paris,"
or the American tourist’s notion of that
metropolis, at the Majestic; and there is a
satisfactory amount of stoush in “The Prisce
of Broadway,” a story of the prize-ring.

Alexander Watson, of the inexpressive face
and the sensitive voice, might have been a
musician if he hadn’t decided to recite for
a living. He can make you soft and senti-
mental with Barrie, decorously gay with
Roderic Quinn, or ready to go forth and
slay a Little Englander with Rudyard Kip-
ling. The moods and persons created by these
poets, and many others, are populating the
stage at Melbourne Playhouse, where the
veteran English elocutionist has returned for
a fifth and final tour.
% # ❖
Melbourne Tivoli is chiefly suffering from
revivals, among whom are Tom Kelly, the
bould —and sometimes overbould —bhoy from
Ireland; the Haney brethren, who are so
chattily confidential with their feet; and the
Lee White-Clay Smith combination, who are
competing with Madame Melba in the number
of their farewells. Of the newcomers are
the Jovers, who brought some sweetly effici-
ent comedy on Saturday; and Donald Stuart,
a long, thin absurdity, who conceals the scan-
tiness of his jugglery behind an outpouring of
the most engaging patter to be heard outside
the taxi stands.
F. R. Crozier, back from U.S.A., shows
strong, active paintings with a touch of
poster at Melb. New Gallery. No. 22 is a
notable effort by a he-man to make a naiad
out of a modern flapper and suggests that
a rich field is being neglected by home
staying artists, who, when they introduce a
girl into their pictures, generally select tin
dowdiest female of their acquaintance and
dress her in the fashions of 1800.
“The Big Parade” is a war picture attract
ing hundreds of Adelaide Diggers to the York.
John Gilbert and Renee Adoree are featured
in the chief roles. The prologue stages a
scene outside an estaminet in France, with
war songs of 1014 sung by Colin Crane and
a thoroughly satisfying chorus.

The drafting committee of the Victorian
Artists’ Society works on a method of its
own. Judging by the melancholy quality of
some of the masterpieces hung, it refuses
nothing that is offered, but it concentrates
the prime wethers of the flock in the two
main galleries, and visitors enter the re-
maining chamber of fantods at their own
risk. The favored pictures mark a con-
siderable advance on last year’s display.
Mclnnes shows the bright social charm of
Mrs. James Dyer, Melbourne’s patroness of
music, in an exquisitely superficial portrait.
Louis McCubbin’s big picture oftheYarrant
Warrandyte is just a trifle mawkish. Mur-
ray Griffin is steadily improving, and in his
vista of tree trunks in a gully lie has mixed
actual truth and decorative fancy with a
vigorous brush. E. Buckmaster has either
fallen from the standard set .by his one-man
show last year or has elected to treat the
Victorian Artists’ Society with contempt;
and F. R. Thompson’s exhibits are also not
the best selections from his highly promising
display of a month ago. There is a satis-
fying rouudness and actuality in Victor Ze.l-
man’s method in his “Grazing Paddock,
Wliittlesea,” and Carlisle Jackson pipes his
usual pleasant roundelays in paint; but
D. D. Knox’s new efforts suggest that lie
has come under the spell of subdued art
shades to the exclusion of strength and
gaiety. His “Country Thai Lies Beyond”
looks like a flat pattern stamped on boarding-
house lino used by many lodgers' feet. Edgar
Finlay’s “Half-Cut Tree" is also half-
painted—he works lull'd to be uninteresting.
J. Alan Fenyon has tried to depict the
flapper parade at St. Kilda but without the
full equipment for the task; but W. G. Col-
lins was quite competent to paint 3LO’s
most beautiful September bride. Blanch Cade
bus immortalised a sitter who. having had
a premonition of the finished picture, is
meditating murder. Chas. Nuttall presents
the only problem picture in the show, the
problem being whether the couple depicted
are taking up “Their Selection” or handing
it over to the mortgagee. The chamber of
Horrible Examples aforementioned is worth
a visit, if only for the portrait of the
tight-lipped, dim-eyed old lady painted by
John Farmer in No. IGO.
Norah Gurdon, at Melb. Athenaeum, lias a
pleasant knack of stumbling on or stalking
down the unsuspected and noil-obvious
elements in Nature’s color scheme. Other-
wise, she labors rather heavily in oils and
goes to pieces on many a jutty promontory
of composition. One of the best hits of
unconventional interior decoration in Ihe
parade is the girl whose tea is agreeing with
her in No. GO.
At the Adelaide Royal "Ii.M.S. Pinafore.”
possibly because it has suffered so often at
the bands of amateurs, proved less of a draw
than other G. and S. operas. Charles Waleun
and James Hay quite fulfilled expectations:
but Stre.Ha Wilson, in spite of her grand
singing, is too o.s. for souhrette roles. “The
< loudoliers” and “lolantlie” follow, with
"Patience” for the last night.
At Adelaide Prince of Wales William Ander-
son is presenting •’The CreakiugChair,” a wcll-
worked-out mystery, that keeps the audience
guessing until the last moment. The English
home of Edwin Latter, an Egyptologist, is
haunted by aggrieved Egyptian spooks who
bang tom-toms to punish the owner for hav-
ing rifled the tomb of one of Pharaoh's
queens. Edwin Latter, in an invalid-chair,
is one of Guy Hastings’s best, impersona-
tions. Hilda Dorrington plays Latter’s wife,
Anita, a half-Egyptian and wholly tempera-
mental lady who bites Edwin with realistic
thoroughness. Austin Milroy is Latter’s
butler and fellow tomb-robber, Victor Fitz-
herbert a muddled detective. George (Cross
a light-hearted reporter, and Agnes Keogh
plays Latter’s daughter, Sylvia. “The Creak-
ing Chair” out-murks even “The Bat” in
uncanny atmosphere.
“ Sclmorrer” : Young Hyman Lenzer is
coining back to Australia with the stamp
of American success upon him. Hyman, son
of the Newtown (Sydney) Jewish minister,
was playing at concerts whilst he was in
knickerbockers. His first tour was with
William Heughan, the Scottish baritone;
and Kreisler gave him a pat on the head,
advice to go to America and an introduction
to Auer. His training in tbe TT.S. finished
with a successful tour.
“Caesar's Ghost”: The Carrolls, whose
success with Kreisler was a magnificent
reward for courage in high bidding, the
violinist’s terms, being very lofty, are bring-
ing out Ignaz Friedman, the pianist, a com-
patriot of Paderewski. It was on Kreisler’s
tip that they secured Friedman, who is re-
ported to have a left hand as good in its
way as the late Peter Jackson’s; he created
a furore at. the Beethoven celebration in
Vienna, where he and ’cellist Pablo Cassals
were the only two foreign musicians engaged.
Poverty
Point
“Hamfat”: Slapoffski, who continues as
conductor of the G. and S. eo., seems likely
to celebrate an interesting jubilee when on
tour; his first association with G. and S.
music was as a member of the orchestra
when “The Sorcerer” was produced on
November 17, 1877, at the London Opera
Comique. An Australian, G. B. Allen, was
leader of the orchestra and another, Alice
May, was Arline. Slap, himself originally
came to Australia with a Musgrove opera
co. in which his wife was a star. He re-
turned as conductor of a German opera co.
in 1907; and 20 years have made him prac-
tically an Australian.
“M.R.C.”: In the Adelaide production of
“The Mikado” Charles Waleun (Ko-Ko)
got his laugh all right (B. 31/3/’27). He
gave Nanki-Poo’s address abroad as
"Moonta,” and a hearty roar went up at
the little town’s expense. The allusion was
to the time-honored jest that no one has
travelled who hasn’t been to “Munta.”
“Caul Boy”: Maurice Moscovitch estab-
lished a Melbourne precedent by cancelling
a performance of “The Fake” because of
his “slight indisposition.” It shows the
danger of elderly actors selecting plays
LUCKY ESCAPE.
MUMMER : “Say what you like, Sirr, hut even
an actor can't live on a quid a week!”
BUMMER: “ ’Struth! Then I’m glad I didn't
join the theatrical profession!”
wliich centre in themselves, and doing with-
out understudies. An all-Australian co. once
came better out of a similar ordeal in Auck-
land. After rehearsing “The Silver King”
for the Saturday evening performance they
went fishing, and on returning at G p.m.
learnt that George Titheradge was seriously
ill. “The Silver King” without G.T. as the
argentiferous monarch would have been like
porridge without salt; and no understudy
had been provided. So things looked blue
until somebody thought of “Zara,” which
had been brought as an emergency and whose
props were lying in the hold of a steamer
ready to go back to Sydney. Stifling the
protests of the ship’s watchman with a suc-
cession of long beers, the team ferreted in
the vessel’s bowels until they brought the
stuff to light; and at S p.m. precisely the
curtain went up.
“Hamfat” : She had draped herself for her
act in a garment apparently made entirely
of ostrich feathers, which shed fluffy par-
ticles as she skipped about the stage. But
her warbling failed to please tin* audience,
and when a wrestle with her top note started
a. particularly large shower of fluff a voice
came from the gallery with deadly distinct-
ness. “No wonder she can't sing," it said.
“She’s moulting!”
GOLDEN NOTES.
“But she said she would let you have the dress for a mere
song.”
“Yes, hut she look Me for Mclba, apparently.”
“Cine Ma”: American movie-makers arc
looking askance at a new invention, the
stereoscopic picture. They don’t like it
because the million-dollar spectacle, which
seldom costs a tenth of the figure claimed,
would then have to live up to its title. The
trouble about the stereoscopic lens is that,
while it emphasises the satisfying roundness
of the Fatty Arbuckles, it at the same time
horribly betrays the flatness of the props.
It refuses to be fooled by a pasteboard rep-
lica of Nineveh or Tyre. The Last _ thing
Hollywood would like is for the device to
become popular.
“Philm Up” • It somehow happened that
on the very day that W. A. Gibson, manag-
ing director of Australasian Films, Ltd., was
vehemently protesting before the Film Com-
mission in Melbourne that American _ pic-
tures exercised no bad effect on the rising
generation, a Williamstown youth of IS
was charged with stealing a revolver. His
father pleaded that the boy “wanted to be
like Tom Mix —every lad does nowadays.”
And most people will agree with the parent
no matter what interested showmen may
say to the contrary.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Many theatrical shows
have come to an end in dramatic circum-
stances ; one I know finished during the
second act of a performance in a country
town with a hitch on the stage and a sub-
sequent demonstration from the audience.
The audience was large, there having been
forewarnings of trouble in the eo. The cir-
cumstances were retold later in the Divorce
Court; but I preserve the description of the
cause of the break-up given me later on by
the hall caretaker: “The villain, going off
the stage, caught ’is wife with the hero in
compromising circumstances.”
“Flaming Youth” : The “Huiitingtower” of
John Buchan, now a British M.P., is to be
filmed. Probably no book contains a more
rapturous description of the Diggers, who
are described as “godlike men with the
courage of warm sunlight in their eyes.”
The film puts Harry Lauder into the picture
business; he is to be the Glasgow grocer who
is interested in boy scouts.
“Hamfat”: Old-timers put their hands
together when Ed-mund Duggan made his
appearance in “Sweet Nell” at the Sydney
Criterion; he handled the part of Percival
well, on broad-comedy lines. Duggan has
written, or been part-author of, half a dozen
Australian plays. His thespian exploits
went as high as playing the name-part m
“Cyrano de Bergerac,” on which occasion
he turned the poetic lines into good melo-
dramatic meat.
“Caul Boy”: Tbe Australian company fin-
ished a disastrous tour of the Shivery Isles
at Dunedin dead-broke. There was not even
enough in the manager’s pocket to pay the
printers. Then the manager bethought him ot
an elderly and well-to-do Dunedinite to whom
he had given a good time in Bananaland
and from whom he had parted with expres-
sions of mutual affection. Half an hour
later he was pressing the bell-button of a
substantial mansion in the suburbs. “No,”
said the tired woman who opened the door,
“you can't see Mr. X. He is very ill."
“Then I think 1 ought to see him,” said the
manager. “But lie is dying,” said the woman.
“Then I simply must see him!” said the
manager. Five minutes later he was leaving
Ihe house with a cheque sufficient to get his
whole crowd back to Sydney. lie never
worried to inquire what the executrix said
when she settled the account.
“Hud”: They do get the money sometimes.
Billy Merson, who was Hard-boiled Herman
in the Drury Lane production of “Rost-
Marie” for the first year of its run, was paid
£10.043 for his work. His salary, it was
disclosed in a court ease, was £350 a week.
“Middle Blue”: Walter Cornoek (B.
21/4 ’27) was assistant s.ru. for about a
minute at the Brisbane
Tivoli. Horace Nightin-
gale's assistant played
with us in the eo. which
came on from the Royal.
The Tivoli could not sup-
port even melodrama. C.
E. King saw it take much
of the good money the
Royal had earned for him
before he threw in the
sponge. Heaven on 1 y
knows what the theatre
cost 11. D. Mclntosh.
Crosbie Ward was the
producer (by which epi-
thet we knew Nightingale
at the Tivoli) at the
Royal. with Brandon
Cremer as manager, when
King’s Dramatic Co. was
the kin" of all melo. cos.
in Australia. Rose Knight
Phillips, Nellie Ferguson.
Florence Richter, Eileen
Sparkes and Vera Reiner
were in turn leading lady
to Gus Neville. Walter
Coruoek and Jefferson
Taite were popular charac-
ter actors second only to
fius. when I first met them.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : It looks as though
Oscar Asche may ho able to trim his new
production, “What Sliall It Profit a Man'.'"
into a successful show. This triangle play
is hy Harold Bourne and V. Langbridgc.
and it had a trial spin at Holders Green
Hippodrome. Asche himself lias an effective
part, which weakens only when he has to
mouth sentimental soliloquies. Sentimental
soliloquising is not for sixteen-stoners.
“Curtain Raiser”: Not long ago. on the
expectation that a scholarship was awaiting
him in London, a young and promising Aus-
tralian violinist set out to conquer Europe,
being helped on his way by the usual bene-
fits and benedictions. When lie got to the
Great Smoke he found that the scholarship
was bogus. After suffering some privation
be found a job in an orchestra. It should be
quite easy for ambitious young virtuosi to
find out whether such fine offers are backed
by responsible bodies before they book their
passages.
“Caul Boy”: There is a strain of origi-
nality in the Fitzgerald family. Jim
Gerald has given abundant evidence of it.
Now S. A. Fitzgerald, his father, who is
playing in “Gum Tree Gully” in Melbourne,
presents the first clean-shaved Dad to appear
on the Australian boards.
“Spotlight”: Apparently the best recom-
mendation one can take to the English stag<
is to issue from a vicarage. Winifred
Wayne went from Napier (MX.) to Lon-
don, fluked a small part in "Tin* Bat, and
did it so well that when “Eliza Comes to
Stay” was revived at the Regent the play-
wright’s wife insisted that Winnie should
have the name-part. She made such a good
showing that her stepfather, Rev. Oliver
Dean, is quite puzzled about it.
“John’s Wood” (Loud.) : Oscar Asche
owns the performing rights of "Kong, a
plav of Chinese life and character by Harry
Kingsley, and unless it is staged in London
before then it is Asche’s intention to appear
in the New York production next autumn.
His part, is that of a mandarin wrestler.
There are no greyhounds in the cast.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : McKee Rankin, tie
main male support to Nance O Nidi and
stage director of the show, allowed no mean
ness in the banquet scene in "Macbeth. L
was a real solid meal that went on the table ;
and the supers., stage-hands and ushers were
invited to eat the food up after the show.
Some of the supers, assured me subsequently,
with tears of enthusiasm, that McKee Ran-
kin was the greatest actor who had ever
trodden Australian boards. But Rankin
allowed his property-man rather to over-do
the thing, as was revealed one night when
an “extra gent./’ anxious to add his bit or
realism to the scene, asked someone in a
loud voice to “Pass the mustard, please.
That drew attention to the fact that muv
lard, which was unknown in the time of
Macbeth, was actually on the table.
THE JUVENILE.
[FFOR THE BULLETIN.]
"Yes, I am in the show,” he said,
This actor old with snowy head,
" ’Tis true. I’ve but a minor part—
But there is such a thing as Art!
“You’ve seen the ballet in Act Time
And may perhaps have noticed me‘:
We’re dressed as dudes with hats and
sticks;
We’re known as ‘The Delightful Six.’
“Then later in that stunning act
We don cream flannels that attract.
And neatly we our racquets swing
And oh! how loud the plaudits ring!
“But still I think we best appear
When in a pyramid we rear
The star upon our shoulders strong,
And bear the smiling girl along.
“Without the chorus it is nJain
Few’d come to see the show again.
And you can pick me every night—
The fourth young man upon the right!”

‘ IVhat a lovely
Gift!"
The Red House Queen.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Raliab of the Red House went
With slow, yet no uncertain tread
From out her fleshy tenement
The lonely way of all the dead,
No crier through the town gave tongue
Though she was regal in her place;
No masses for her soul were sung;
She had no aids to saving grace.
Myself, alone, passed through the door
From Babylon’s unheeding street,
Made here secure for evermore,
With sin upon it, safe and sweet.
A-many men have trod that path
Of odorous shrubs and shady trees,
In scorn of any Day of Wrath,
And hymned their lurid litanies.
Now who takes thought or who can spare
The tribute of a ghostly sigh
For Raliab of the golden hair,
Red lip and love-compelling eye?
Yet priceless laughter rang from her
In sunlit ripples, and her frown
Abashed the proudest paramour
Of highest honor in the town.
0 Beautiful! So like lithe tilings
That pressed and purred, with slitted lids,
About the knees of buried kings
In painted tombs of pyramids,
No more in shame of day’s return
And of her homing reprobates,
Through the chaste dawn shall her lamps
burn
Held by twin vestals at her gates!
And yet men walk about the town
Whose marrow in their bones is cold,
Not knowing she has doffed her crown
Though still be-ringed with gems and gold,
And that her firm, uplifted chin
Shuts her mouth close as thus she lies,
And there is no more light within
The bleak and heavy-lidded eyes.
No knowledge of unseemly things
Lies near confession to involve
Those men of votive offerings
Who trust to Silence to absolve.
Yet here I sorrow for her doom
And watch by her a little space
Within the sickly-scented room,
And see a white soul in her face—
A soul that like a wild bird came
( As quiet as a brooding dove,
Content at last, and without shame,
To warm the cold dead heart with love.
Dear Magdalene! Did she but stir
And from her slumber seek to move,
I would maintain Death’s right to her,
However Life might disapprove.
Leave her alone! No priest she needs,
No holy water on her pall,
While her immortal Jesus bleeds
Or Marys travail in the stall.
MAORILAND.
DARIUS.
Olaf.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SIX-FOOT-TWO of humanity, the blue
eyes of a child, high cheekbones, a
square head covered with flaxen hair
on a neck and shoulders that conveyed the
impression of the muscular strength of an
ape. He could march with a full kit for
hours and know no fatigue; he was chosen
for the heaviest jobs at Broadmeadows, and
enjoyed them. Eighteen-pounders had a
fascination for this flaxen giant of the
infantry, who examined them with a look
of reverence in his eyes and a smile of
satisfaction on his lips. “Guns, eh? Kill
plenty,” and his quaint sense of humor
made his long yellow fangs come into view.
Week-end leave was never asked for by
Olaf, who was always on a lonesome wan-
der, or at camp concerts, for music always
made tears dwell in his eyes.
The ape with the blue eyes of a child
had been born in Schleswig-Holstein 30
years previously. When they had made
clear to him the meaning of next-of-kin,
Olaf had answered the question of attesta-
tion. “No fader, no modder, no nothing!
Just Olaf.”
“To whom will you leave your money'
if you are killed?”
Then the blue eyes of the giant had
wandered for a time before he answered:
‘Chil-ran hospit-il. Olaf give money to
chil-ran.”
So the Children’s Hospital became his
next-of-kin and Olaf a Digger in the A.I.F.
No miser ever guarded his jewels and
cared for them as the giant cared for his
kit, his rifle and his bayonet. The ancient
quiff—born of the regular army—of trying
to take a, rifle from a sentry made him
sullen; with an angry jerk and shake of
die head he would mutter: “No! No!
Olaf’s rifle!” The big hands with their
feathery palms would close around the nose-
cap and the bayonet with the unconscious
play of affection of a sleeping child for a
Pretty toy. There was a reverence for and
obedience to officers, and the brain that
reMtmmed in the dome of the giant
absorbed instruction with uncanny rapiditv.
•Teach Olaf! Olaf fight! Olaf kill!” lie
was a student who, with enthusiasm sicken-
ing to witness, stabbed suspended bags with
Jus bayonet, and hurried on to the next
in a frenzy of glee. An Englishman, reputed
f i n ie ~ time champion bayonet-fighter
of the British army, came as instructor to
the camp. A ball of muscle, this dapper
Englishman with sleeves rolled up thrust
an imaginary enemy in front
of the squad in a manner that made the
heart of Olaf beat faster with admiration,
•io show how he, an unarmed man, could
disarm even a strong man with a fixed
bayonet, the instructor called Olaf out.
Whilst the rest sat and watched the exhibi-
tion, the giant stood, with bayonet fixed,
at “the ready,” waiting—waiting whilst the
Englishman explained to him and the squad.
Afterwards only Harris—Claude Harris, the
little, pale-handed bank-clerk whom he had
“adopted” and who honored the confidence
—only he knew how tears had come into
the eyes of the giant at the recollection
of his defeat by the Englishman. There-
after, off parade, the Englishman was ever
dogged by the foreigner asking: “You
teach Olaf! Olaf pay!”
What happened no one knows, but after-
wards Olaf took leave on every occasion;
and at the camp exhibition of skill at arms
prior to sailing, Olaf’s nimble bayonet ever
glistened in dangerous proximity to the
throat of the instructor.
“There’s a raw recruit after four weeks’
training, gentlemen!”—the tone of pride
in the instructor’s voice was Olaf’s victory.
Grim, silent figure that he was, Olaf had
gained popularity with his “outfit,” with
here and there an exception who mur-
mured: “The blighter might be a spy!”
As they waited in the ranks in the early
morning ready to march out to entrain for
Port Melbourne, the foreign giant broke
his usual silence in the ranks to pat Harris
on the shoulder and mutter: “Clod, you
Olaf’s mate, and Olaf ready to fight now.”
The big foreigner’s devotion to “Clod”
amounted to almost a canine fidelity. He
was one of the many to whom no women-
folk said good-bye; but tears rose to his
eyes in sympathy with the white-haired
mother and pretty girls who wept farewell
to “Clod.” As Claude turned away when
the streamer connecting him with his
mother on shore broke, the loud voice of
the foreign giant carried like the sound of
a bell across the water: “Clod come back.
Olaf —no! ”
The cramped life and monotony on the
transport often drove Olaf below to stoking
the fires for relief; stripped to the waist,
the play of his big muscles beneath the
white skin of a woman was a thing of
beauty. He ate beside Claude and swung
in the next hammock.
Whilst Claude played cards below Olaf
would sit on the hatches at night, silently
chewing strong tobacco, with his knees
drawn up under his chin and his large
paws clasped around his shins.
Claude came and sat beside him, un-
noticed, one night.
“Fight Turk soon, Olaf! Egypt the day
after to-morrow.”
“Hello, Clod! Fight Turk soon, eh? No
good!”
For a time he went on chewing, swaying
with the motion of the boat and watching
the moon-path on the waters.
“German—he fight well, Olaf?” queried
Claude.
“A-a-ah,” he growled. “Prooshin fight
fierce. He fight to kill!” Then, as if talk-
ing aloud and repeating a prayer slowly
to himself: “Prooshin fight and take Schles-
wig 50 year ago now. Kill Olaf grandfader
and worse than kill Olaf grandmudder.
Olaf’s mudder tell Olaf. Olaf remember
since liddle poy. Olaf fight Prooshin —
soon!”
Glancing up Claude saw the face of a
mortally wounded ape, with its fangs bare.
Then the giant blonde cleared his throat
noisily before up-ending himself and going
down silently below. Ten minutes later he
was dead asleep, snoring, with one giant
tattooed arm hanging over the edge of his
swaying hammock.
Kicking his way through the Wazza
with Claude, he was hailed in German by
a blonde female. Olaf stopped dead in his
stride to look upon the woman with his
fangs bared in a cold sneer; then he
answered her in her own tongue so that
she stepped back as if struck across the face
with a lash.
Then came the march to Moascar. Those
who were there will remember the blonde
giant who carried the other fellow’s kit as
well as his own, and was the freshest of
them all at the end. It was a march in-
tended for giants only. “Clod” was the
“other fellow.”
At Gallipoli Olaf and Claude were
amongst those who relieved Hunter’s “out-
fit” at Quinn’s Post. Hunched up into the
smallest space he was all eyes and ears
waiting for the Turk. Casualties on his
own side were numerous, but he continued
to smile so long as it was not “Clod.” There
were times when the tired, distraught
Claude hated the cool blonde beast. “It’s
merely a human bloodhound that kills for
the love of killing. It’s not human. It’s
a machine that requires no food and never
sleeps!” Claude would mutter to himself.
But it was the strong tattooed arms of the
foreigner that carried the unconscious
Claude, with blood pouring from a wound
in the chest, to the beach at Anzac, ignor-
ing all military instructions.
After Gallipoli, the Ghurka was the one
glorious exception in his hatred of the
colored man. “Ghurka fight. He kill!” and
with ill-concealed admiration in his voice he
would draw his index-finger across his throat.
Came the evacuation, with the blonde
giant a little weary, but still unscathed.
Then Marseilles, Bailleul, Neuve Eglise.
Olaf, at the top of his form physically, was
forever chanting a foreign song with childish
delight. Women had no place in his scheme,
but little children were things of everlasting
beauty in his eyes, and were taken up
readily into his arms. Then lollies screwed
up in little paper packets would miracul-
ously appear—always little paper packets.

French women hurriedly took their child-
ren from him, muttering under their breath:
“Allemandc!” and. his hair cropped bare to
the skull heightened the impression. Any
suspicion of Olaf being a spy died on Galli-
poli. He had blotted it out with Turkish
blood. Yet around him collected ugly sus-
picions after Neuve Eglise. It grew into
whispered rumor down on the Somme in ’l6.
No one had ever seen Olaf with a prisoner;
no one had seen him “souvenir” the living
or the dead. Of his courage there was not
the shadow of a doubt, for in tight corners the
blonde beast chewed his tobacco slowly,
waiting as if for the sound of a familiar
voice. He was a thing bom of war that
war would not injure. He was uncanny.
It came about at Zonnebeke through the
little intelligence officer at Battalion head-
quarters, a saddler in private life, wanting
an interpreter for three captured prisoners.
Olaf was sent for. Mud-clogged to the
knees, his tin-hat awry and his rifle slung
Carelessly on his shoulder, Olaf came stamp-
ing in, with a look of wonderment in his
eyes when confronted by the three prisoners.
One was big, as big as Olaf; another looked
a youth of seventeen; the other wore thiek-
lensed glasses. It was the age and service
of the boy that were required—he looked
so young with his rosy cheeks and smiling
face. When it was made known to him
what was required, Olaf’s face wore a look
of disgust. It was to the boy he addressed
his remarks, in German.
The big Hun prisoner was the one who
straightened himself to his full height, and
sneered back a reply at Olaf.
“He say,” pointing to the big German, “he
German under-officer, not an information-
bureau.”
“Make him answer,” the little saddler
answered curtly.
Like a flash the fist of Olaf struck the big
German prisoner in the mouth.
“Hold up there, Olaf!”
Olaf repeated his questions in German and
the information came through. Then he
turned impatiently to go.
“Take them back to Brigade, and then
report to your platoon,” he was told.
Olaf stopped dead in his tracks —dumb-
founded. It was the guttural snarl of an
angry ape that made the prisoners obey im-
mediately and precede him up out of the
dugout. Later on, an excited artillery officer,
rushing in, spoke of a German kneeling at
the feet of a giant Digger, praying. They
found three dead Germans in a shell-hole
not far from the duckboards that came down
to the corduroy road, near the eighteen-
pounder batteries. Death had been kindest
to the youngest one who looked a boy, for
blood came from a bullet wound in his
temple, and he wore a smile on his lips.
Olaf had reported back to his platoon.
* * * #
Lieut. Harris—one-pip artist from Oxford
—had joined his old platoon prior to Pas-
schendaele and the first one to welcome
“Clod” was Sergeant Olaf. Hellfire Corner,
the Menin road, Passchendaele —they are
mere memories now. The best Australia
could produce fought the pick of the Ger-
man army and every inch of ground took
its toll of human life; for men fought hand-
to-hand with naked steel. The crest of the
ridge—then back again—then forward; and
so it waged, with the eyes of Europe look-
ing on at a youthful nation fighting the
cream of an army conscious of long tradi-
tion to maintain.
With the rise and fall of that tide of
war moved Olaf laying waste as he went.
Flashed through the brain of the giant
simultaneously a grateful memory of the
bayonet-instructor at Broadmeadows and the
weeping women of Schleswig fifty years
before; and conscious of his own strength
and skill he fought with cold hate. Back
over the ground they had taken and for-
feited, Olaf noted casually as he went that
“no quarter” was the Prussian order of the
day. Inwardly he admired their thorough-
ness, their want of mercy—and Olaf was
extending himself in return. He felt a
wave of unspeakable joy pass through him.
They were dead Prussian Guards that he
walked amongst.
Then before him advanced the biggest
Prussian that yet he had encountered. There
was no fear in the eyes of his opponent,
who came boldly towards him with bayonet
fixed. Each was trained to the minute,
and they sized each other up in a fraction
of a second. Neither faltered as Olaf mut-
tered in German a blasphemous invitation to
“Come on!” He measured his distance accu-
rately, made a feinting pass, and as the
big Prussian came forward with a death
thrust, his head went back with a jolt, and
he collapsed at the feet of the giant. Olaf
wiped something warm from his left hand,
but it had spattered dark-red on his tunic
unnoticed. When the world w r as in its death-
grips, such things were minor details.
Somewhere the staccato rappings of a Ger-
man machine-gun commenced on his right.
Olaf seemed to be an isolated, grim figure
that loomed large in that ocean of mud.
War that had so far left him unscathed
seemed to concentrate its whole fury on
him. Machine-gun bullets fell short a yard
in front of him. He hated machine-guns,
they were so noisy. He was pulling pins
and throwing things at the German
machine-gun post, as if it were meat to a
famished dog.
“By Hell! They’ve got Olaf!”
With the final burst of the machine-gun
something gnawed savagely at the heart-
line of Olaf, and blood came warm into
his throat. Tottering like a boxer in
the twilight-zone of consciousness, he looked
back over his shoulder and waved them
fonvard with a tired gesture. As if with a
superhuman exercise of will-power, he
walked steadily towards the post he had
wiped out before jinking down on his
buttocks with that suddenness mat makes
children laugh when done by a clown in
a circus. Eyes from every angle of shell-
holes watched the big blonde giant fight-
ing death and groping for something in his
pocket. Then the huge body tilted over
slowly into the mud.
As they passed him lying amongst the
Prussian 'dead, Olaf’s lifeless body held a
pistol in his hand, and a packet of lollies
lay scattered in the mud.
Sundays and holidays, a daintily-c’ad
woman, accompanied by her husband, Capt.
Claude Harris, brings flowers to the little
sick occupant of a cot in a children’s hos-
pital that bears the inscription: “Presented
by the late Sergeant Olaf Chundersen,
D.C.M., M.M.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YAIRS, I wouldn’t lia’ took live notes
fer that there dawg,” said Bill, stoop-
ing over the lamb-markers’ fire and
helping himself from the coffee dixie. “I
got ’im w’en a pup, out of a holler lawg,
near Barringun, an’ I carried him through
the border gates in a billycan. A pure-bred
dingo, an’ that clever! You’da thought I
was ’is father the way ’e useter be’ave with
me. That was the time all Queensland was
puttin’ up dawg fences ter keep the sheep
alive. The boards useter give a pound a
scalp an’ the stations another thirty deeners
fer the same scalp, makin’ two pound ten in
all, if yer c’n understand me, an’ it didn’t
matter if they was just pupped ten minutes
—they was glad to get ’em killed. I seen
a dawgger on Thurlagoona track a female
dingo to ’er ’idin’-place, an’, findin’ she was
a-goin’ ter ’ave an increase in the fambly.
’e jest went away fer a week an’ kem back
agen an’ got ther mother an’ ther father an’
six pups. A mug would lia’ shot tlier mother
first orf an’ got fifty deeners, but this
cove collected twelve quid.
“Any’ow, I’m ridin’ the long round way
about this ’ere dingo pup. Times was bad.
Ther track from Bourke ter Charleville was
as hungry as a mob o’ store bullicks. I
useter tie the pup to Matilda an’ breast the
station store rer yakker or a fill o’ the nose-
bags. But there was a hellava lot at the
same game an’ a man had all he could do
ter keep ’is backbone from wearin’ a hole
in ’is stummick, if yer c’n understand me.
But one day I takes it fer granted that
there is nothin’ doin’, an’ don’t stop walkin’
w’en I gets outside the store —never puts me
swag down er nothin’. The boss was there.
“ ‘G’day,’ ses I.
“ ‘Travellin’ ?’ ses ’e.
“ ‘No,’ ses I. ‘l’m lookin’ fer work —c’n
yer gimme a start?’
“ ‘No,’ ses ’e.
“ ‘C’n yer gimme some rations?’ ses I.
“ ‘We give nothin’ here ter travellers,’ ses
’e, ‘not even flour er nigger twist’; an’
smilin’ ter ’imself ’e jest steps a-past me
like as if I was a tame gohanna. Then ’e
seen ther dawg—got a good eyefull of it,
sniffin’ at a fowl an’ pullin’ on ther chain.
“ ‘W’erejer git that dawg?’ ses ’e, sudden
an’ loud.
“ ‘lt’s a good dawg,’ ses I. ‘I bred ’im
meself. It’s a sheep dawg.’
“ ‘Too right it’s a sheep dawg,’ ses ’e. ‘lf
it gets loose on the run it’ll kill half the
lambs before they’re a month old. It’s
a dingo,’ ses ’e. ‘l’ll give yer two pound ten
fer it.’
“ ‘No,’ ses I.
“ ‘Three pounds,’ ses ’e.
“ ‘Not ten,’ ses I. ‘That’s the o’ny mate
I got on the track,’ ses I, ‘an’ you wouldn’t
be kind ter ’im, I feel sure.’
“ ‘You won’t sell ’im?’ ses ’e.
“ ‘No,’ ses I.
“ ‘Jimmy,’ ses ’e ter the jackeroo behind
the store counter, ‘fill this man’s ration bags.
Give ’im a forequarter of mutton, an’ flour,
an’ some tea an’ sugar, an’ a bit er sawit,
an’ a box er matches an’ a plug er nigger
twist. An’ look here, me man,’ ses ’e.
‘You keep that dawg on the chain till yer
get outside my boundary— do yer hear?’
“T ain’t so deaf as I was,’ I ses. an’
left with me nosebags full ter overflowin’.
“Well, o’ course, that give me the idea,
an’ I never went short er tucker from that
day on. I jest ’ad ter waltz up ter the
station with Ginger on the chain an’ ask fer
a job or rations. One look at Ginger an’
they wanted ter buy ’im, at the top o’ ther
market. An’ I always got the nosebag full
w’en I refused ter sell, d’yer see? It worked
right up ter the other side o’ Coolamon.
O’ course they could ha’ shot the dawg, even
w’en ’e was on the chain an’ me ’oldin’ it.
But the grass was that dry—an’ it was
easy to be careless with matches, if yer c’n
understand me.
“ ‘Any’ow, the week the droqght broke I
lobs at a pl»ce on the upper Warrego, an’
the usual talkin’ match starts. But w’en
the boss gets ’is lamps on Ginger ’e don’t
offer ter buy ’im. ’E offers me a job, orf-
sidin’ ter the teamster ’oo was gettin’ in
wood fer the shearin’.
“ ‘Yer poor 'little dawg looks ’ungry,’ ses
’e, in a kind tone of voice, an’ ’e goes inter
the store an’ brings out some meat an’
gives it ter me. ‘Give ’im a bite.’ ses ’e.
‘lt won’t do ter lose a good dawg like that.’
“Ther kind way ’e ses it—l could lia’ kissed
’im. It was the first kind word a squatter ’ad
ever spoke on be’alf of Ginger. I chucks
im the meat, an’ ’e scoffs it in one swaller.
The next minute me poor little Ginger was
in ’is dyin’ struggles. The dirty cow ’ad
give ’im a bait in ther meat. I could ha’
stiffened ’im !
“ ‘lf I was a squatter an’ you was a poor
man,’ ses I, ‘l’d be in a position ter tell
yer that yer are a yeller-livered dawg-
murderer, yer dirty crawsbreed,’ ses I, ‘but.
as I’m on’y a poor man an’ yer might pull
me, I won’t say it.’ Y’see, by this time the
grass was that wet a bit o’ carelessness
with a match didn’t matter.”

adding' new beauty to
traditional strength & stamina
How Studebaker
eliminates Vibration
Studebaker’s extra heavy
crankshaft is fully mach-
ined on all surfaces to
perfect inherent dynamic
balance*
All reciprocating parts, in-
cluding connecting rods,
pistons, piston rings, bear-
ings and gudgeon pins, are
accurately matched to
weights of perfect balance,
thus completely elimin-
ating vibration.
No artificial balancers, vi-
bration dampeners, or
counter balancing weights
are attached to the Stude-
baker crankshaft to dam-
pen or muffle vibration.
In the Studebaker engine
there is no vibration to
dampen or muffle. Stude-
baker’s method of elimin-
ating vibration by machin-
ing the extra heavy crank-
shaft on all surfaces to
inherent dynamic balance
and accurately matching
all reciprocating parts to
weights of perfect balance
is expensive, yet it is the
only method which abso-
lutely ensures vibrationless
performance at all times,
at all speeds and under all
conditions.
The beauty of the New Custom Sedans is evident
at even the most casual glance* What distinction!
What symmetry! What long, flowing lines!
What graceful contours!
To-day you can enjoy the coveted exclusiveness
of a car of individual design, distinctive beauty
and luxurious comfort, yet pay no more than
you would for one of ordinary, commonplace
design*
The new beauty of Studebaker Custom design,
plus the traditional stamina and super-excellence
of the Studebaker chassis and the many improve-
ments, refinements and perfections incorporated
in the New Studebaker Custom Sedans evoke
both admiration for the car itself and respect
for its owner.
