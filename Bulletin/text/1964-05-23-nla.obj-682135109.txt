Rome is just one of 44 major European cities
••jg*
to which KLM can fly you—reliably
(KLM operates the world's second-largest international air network)
Whether you’re travelling for business or pleasure, whether Rome
means “home” to you or an exciting place to visit on your way to
somewhere else, you can rely on KLM to get you there comfortably
and punctually. KLM has been flying longer than any other existing
airline —that means KLM has had longer to perfect its service and
its reliability. Now read more reasons why KLM should be your first
choice when you’re flying to Europe.
KLM flies to 104 cities in 68
Countries. And KLM’s Multi-Stopover
Plan allows you to linger in many places
on your way, if you wish, for no extra
air fare. En route to Rome you might
like to break your journey at such cities
as Bangkok, Beirut, Cairo or Athens.
Beyond Rome, KLM can take you to
Amsterdam, Paris, Luxembourg, London,
North, South or Central America —
practically anywhere you want to go.
A KLM jet captain never stops learn-
ing. Before a KLM pilot can become a
DC-8 jet captain he must have 12 years’
flying experience. Even then, he goes
back to school seven times a year for
refresher courses.
KLM engineers “baby” their DC-8
jets. A KLM plane gets an average of
800 X-ray shots per year. KLM
pioneered the X-ray inspection of air-
planes. More than 30% of KLM’s main-
tenance work is done for other airlines.
Which shows how KLM’s technical
know-how is respected throughout the
airline industry.
KLM cabin crews are trained to
anticipate passengers’ wants. They
must be pleasant, capable, polite—in
short, ideal hosts and hostesses. Quite a
few KLM stewards and stewardesses
speak five or six languages. Everyone
speaks at least Dutch, English, French
and German. All stewardesses are taught
baby care. KLM likes to keep all its
passengers happy.
A KLM DC-8 intercontinental jet leaves
Sydney every Thursday at 10.45 a.m.
Melbourne passengers can make a same-
day connection comfortably. You can
a*»
breakfast in Rome or Amsterdam, lunch
in London punctually on Friday.
Ask your Travel Agent to plan your
tour. With his professional know-how he
can help you make the most of your
time and money. Two of every three
KLM passengers are recommended to
fly KLM by experienced Travel Agents.

Improving on perfection
PRAKTICA cameras and Mercedes-Benz have several things in common.
They are both among the oldest and most respected German manufacturers
in their fields. Long years ago, when many of today’s cameras were not
even thought of, PRAKTICA were making fine cameras. Today, like the
Mercedes-Benz radiator and star, the appearance of the PRAKTICA has
changed very little. But inside, every worthwhile feature of a good SLR
has been built in to make it the finest camera you’ll ever use. With
PRAKTICA you have the choice of 25 interchangeable lenses, 28 mm. to
1,000 mm. See your HANIMEX Dealer soon. Let him show you the full
PRAKTICA system of camera models, lenses and accessories. Ask him to
explain the versatility of PRAKTICA and you’ll understand why more Aus-
tralians have bought PRAKTICA than any other brand. Models £39 to £65.

TO THE
EDITOR
AN “ACADEMIC QUESTION”?
Sir,
Commander Craster C. M. Usher
(9/5/64) is indeed taking a “risk” when
he suggests that the controversy between
myself and Professor Legge about the
power political realities of Indonesia is
“academic”. The first time I met Pro-
fessor Legge was when he appeared in
Djakarta, slightly tousled after many
months spent living at grass roots level
amongst very unacademic Indonesians
in (I think) the Celebes. As I recall,
he did not have a gunboat under his
command; but his experiences were
quite as first-hand as Commander
Usher’s. For my part, I entered acade-
mic life as the result of studying a few
Asian problems on the spot, of a nature
by no means academic. Commander
Usher’s sneer is singularly misplaced.
More importantly by far, the question
of the possible effectiveness of a naval
blockade of Java which, in view of
President Soekarno’s fascist megalomania
(imitative of the West even down to
bookburning), Commander Usher has
very properly raised for discussion, is
intimately related to the political power
structure of Indonesia, Whether
Sumatra might, under certain induced
conditions, “join” Malaysia must depend
|'Pon the nature of regional controls.
j s Commander Usher seriously suggest-
ing that this is an academic question?

practice for committees of the Profes-
sorial Board to include non-professorial
members who sometimes act as chair-

The Faculties, composed of all pro-
fessors and lecturers, tend to be lively
and active bodies and not mere rubber-
stamps for heads of departments. In-
tense effort has been given to developing
lines of communication within the uni-
versity and to encouraging all ranks to
participate in formulating academic
policy.
“Fawkner” is also mistaken in several
of his specific points of criticism. Pro-
fessorial selection committees are not
confined to professors but include several
lay members of Council. The proposed
rank of Associate-Professor, which the
Professorial Board has recommended
and which is being considered by Council
at the moment, is by no means to be
confined to “academics of outstanding
scholarship who (have) made a unique
contribution in their field”.

THOMAS REIBEY
Sir,
I thank Mr G. T. Stilwell (2/5/64)
for pointing out the misprint of Sir
Frederick Weld's name as “Wells'’, and
the slip of the pen which made “Trinity
College” into “Trinity HaH” in my
article on Thomas Reibey (28/3/64).
I plead not guilty to his general charge
that the article contains “many inac-
curacies and false impressions”, which
he purports to enumerate with such
zeal that he even chides me for calling
one Henry Jellicoe “Harry”, the name
by which he was generally known in
sporting circles.
He chides me for saying Entally was
at “Westbury”. The name seems to
have had a much wider connotation in
Reibey’s day. The Australian Encyclo-
edia says the place was “near West-
bury”, and that Reibey represented
Westbury electorate.
I gave no wrong dates, as he suggests,
in lightning-sketching Reibey's ecclesi-
astical progress. I did not write that in
his youth he mixed in the “exclusive
circles of Vandemonian society”. What
I did write was that when he had be-
come squire of Entally and a figure in
the church his intimates ranged from
Government House to Sir Richard Dry
of Quamby which was correct. I
was quite right, despite Mr Stilwell’s
view, in saying that Reibey's youthful
life among mansions and squires with
whom Surtees, the creator of the im-
mortal Jorrocks and Mr Facey Rom-
ford, would have been at home, was far
different from that of his mother
daughter of a London Court physician;
it seems obvious.
I did not imply that “the lady whom
Reibey seduced’’ Mr Stilwell grossly
libels her in averring that she was
seduced, which she wasn't was single
as well as young. I merely quoted the
description of her by Reibey’s accusers
and added that the incident took place
in “her own drawing-room”, which im-
plies, if anything, that she was married.

ANTI-SEMITISM
Sir,
After having listened to the discussion
between Senator Cohen and the Rev. Dr
McKay on Channel 2 on April 18 on
the programme Four Corners, I was
appalled and frightened at the attitude
of Dr McKay to the incident of the
Nazi stickers and proofs of anti-Semitism
in Australia.
In my opinion the first reaction of
Dr McKay to these proofs, produced by
Senator Cohen, should have been that
it is the absolute duty of the Govern-
ment to find out with all methods at its
disposal where these stickers came from
and who is behind this movement. He
only tried to defend a body of persons
without tangible proof against an accu-
sation which had at least some proof.
The body which has been attacked by
Senator Cohen did not even bother to
defend itself as the Hungarian societies
have done in the daily Press.

TIMOR OIL
Sir,
I refer to the article ‘‘Timor Sleep-
ing Island”, by Mr Robert Raymond
(29/2/64). As secretary of Timor Oil
Limited and as a frequent visitor who
has spent much time in Portuguese
Timor over the past 18 years, and
worked almost on the borders of Portu-
guese and Indonesian Timor, I ask you
to correct some of the inaccuracies in
the article:
1. At no time did Timor Oil Limited
build a swimming pool, or contribute to
a swimming pool, at Baucau. 2. Ex-
ploration equipment is admitted into
Portuguese Timor free of duties under
similar regulations to those applying in
Australia. 3. The small amount oi
duties paid by Timor Oil Limited annu-
ally would not contribute a fraction ot
one per cent of the Timor Budget. 4.
Considerable exploration on the mineral
resources of Timor was carried out b)
the Asia Investment Company, who
maintained a large staff before the war
to find and assess the possible minera
resources of Timor. 5. As Timor C
Limited has spent £2,000,000 on tn e
search for oil in Timor, it is hardly a
small company”. 6. Australia has been
importing coffee from Timor for
years, ft is a high quality coffee an
the selling price is comparable wi
world prices of coffee of this quad/
7. In all my time in Timor I have neve
ever seen a border patrol from
side, nor have I noticed any "garrison
atmosphere” at “all the large cent f eS '
I presume “large centres” refers to tno

Mr Raymond’s remarks about the
previous visit of an Australian journalist
having made “a deeper and more
wounding impression in Dilli than per-
haps they had in Australia” are wide of
the mark. The previous inaccurate re-
porting and predictions based on a brief

NAZIS AND THE VATICAN
Sir,
It would take up too much of your
space to expose the ignorant misstate-
ments made by Mr R. Johns (11/4/64).
I would refer him to the encyclical
“Non Abbiamo Bisognq” and to the
later encyclical “Mit Brennender Sorge”
which Cardinal Pacelli and Pius XI
collaborated in writing, and which is
one of the most fearless condemnations
of Nazism. In 1934 Pius XI in a mes-
sage to German youth denounced anti-
Semitism. In August, 1934. the Ger-
man bishops, including Cardinals Innit-
zer and Faulhaber, condemned Nazism.
In October, 1934, Cardinal Faulhaber
denounced the new paganism, and in
1937 again denounced Nazism. In
1943 the German bishops again de-
nounced Nazism

RETARDED CHILDREN
Sir,
Mr J. N. Hannan (16/5/64) seems
to think that all retarded children are
of the same type—kind, generous and
gentle. Certainly there are such child-
ren —the mongoloids, for instance. But
has Mr Hannan never heard of the
extreme idiot types, who, according to
the “Everyman Encyclopaedia”, “have no
power of speech, of care for themselves,
of distinction between two persons, with
no feelings of love or hate, pleasure or
pain, who are usually dwarfish, ugly and
misshapen, and who sometimes cannot
even walk ...”
Any doctor will tell Mr Hannan that
these unfortunate, sub-human creatures
are unteachable, and that no amount of
family love and care can help them.
J. F. D. MAXWELL

THE AUSTRALIAN BALLET
Sir,
Endlessly inventive though Mr Kemp’s
review of The Australian Ballet
(2/5/64) was, its interest was that of
publicity rather than that of criticism.
As a way of publicising our national
company, more striking diversionary
tactics could scarcely have been employ-
ed. Serious criticism, we expect, will be
informed by a sense of the traditions,
achievements and possibilities of the art
it strives to define and evaluate. Mr
Kemp's critical standards, however, are
all too clear in the tone and pitch of
what he has to say. He speaks at length
of the “star quality” which is able & to
“capture and excite great audiences”-
“all it needs is to be built up and sold
to the public”. Excitement, indeed,
seems central to Mr Kemp’s feeling of
critical competency in discussing ballet:
he praises “this exciting and vigorous
young company”, he speaks of Marilyn
Jones and her sex-appeal, of Kathleen
Gorham and her fire, of ballet “com-
pletely carrying the audience”, of a
“fierce perfection of technique”, and of
a season which has “injected some lusty
life into our theatre”.
Borne on this invigorating surge, Mr
Kemp proposes to “say a long good-bye
to classical ballets”, offering in their
place “new movement patterns of
society". It seems fitting that, since my
own understanding of choreography has
been gained from an acquaintance with
the classical tradition and the imagina-
tive life it makes possible, I should find
myself unable to profit by Mr Kemp’s
critical insights. One wonders, for
example, just how dissolving light “set
off a whole pattern of rhythms and
movements of modern life”. If Mr
Kemp means that “Jazz Spectrum” is
likely to attract the mass audience in
whom he displays such interest, then he
should say so. There is no need to sur-
round such a proposition with preten-
tious inanities.
Nothing in Mr Kemp's review prompts
me to believe in his adequacy to the
task he has undertaken—his strictures
on Margot Fonteyn are as ludicrously
inept as his critical formulations. It is,
above all, embarrassing that such naked
frailty should be exhibited in public.
ROBIN GROVE
Co-Editor, “Theatre - ’
University of Melbourne.
(Vic.).
Sir,
Margot Fonteyn, a dancer who occu-
pies the foremost position in world
ballet today, who has worked with every
choreographer of note during the past
twenty-odd years, who has danced the
classical roles in the great theatres of the
world, acclaimed by audiences in Russia,
throughout Europe and America, is
thought by Kevon Kemp (2/5/64) to
have danced Swan Lake “very well in
the English style”. She is unfavorably
compared to Kathleen Gorham, but no
further criticism is granted her.
It is disturbing that such statements,
showing no evidence of thoughtful res-
ponsiveness to the tradition from which
ballet today derives, should be issued as
serious criticism. In the face of so ig-
norant a display Miss Gorham must
surely feel an embarrassment similar to
mine.
LAUREL MARTYN.

National Notebook
iicly Garland
udy Garland’s appearance at the
Sydney Stadium last week was a
iumph of nostalgia over performance,
le is very thin these days, and taut,
id apprehensive and, it seemed to us,
lf-lacerating. She’s also quick-witted
. a slightly waspish, defensive way. On
le Dave Allen Show on Thursday night
lr Allen, obviously in a bit of a sweat,
at the name of her actor friend, Mark
lerron, wrong. Quick as a flash Miss
•larland asked Mr Allen what his name
j'as. She was in indifferent voice the
light we saw her, sometimes it was good
Ind sometimes not. She complained of
frog in her throat, that she was a “frog-
l/oman”, and she may have had a cold.
Whatever the cause, her voice is not what
fe remember it, although she can still
pelt it out in the old, strident way and she
as got style.
I The most interesting part of the show
/as the audience response, which seemed
p move her. It should
ave, for it was a moving
ling to see thousands, in-
luding a large number of
oung people, who can
carcely have remembered
ier in her youth, give her
standing ovation. They
;ave, the impression that they didn't
:are about bad acoustics or if she sang
ndifferently or not, just so long as she
■ang; that, as a member of the audience
ihouted out to her, she was “Judy Gar-
and and that’s enough”.
But it wasn’t quite enough for Miss
darland, apparently, who kept on com-
pulsively assuring us that she didn’t
Link, that she couldn't read a score (so
what?), that Hollywood was hell and
stupid, too, that she was a moving target
for critics, that newspapermen were un-
fair, that she did NOT arrive sobbing
at the airport, so there. She even gave
. er nice flat stomach a resounding smack
just to prove that she was thin these days
and no longer overweight. And yet,
cspite all this, and the uneven singing,
iss Garland has that elusive star quality
which is more than just the sum of an
adists skills, and perhaps it was that
which moved us as well as the memories.
A Fair Cow
among many undeniable dis-
tinctions, can now be called the
° n y city on earth (we think) to have
c phrase “Cows Only” on some of its
? ar gates. The park-keepers concerned
av e kept cows as a cheap method of
ee Ping the grass down.
Even when these obsolete cow-
meadows have been replanted as befits
a Festival City, the signs have remained.
Now no less a person than Alderman
Sir Arthur Ryrnill, MLC —a former Lord
Mayor—is agitating for the removal of
the signs. Sir Arthur has quite rightly
pointed out that with the invention of
the lawnmower, animals are obsolete
for grass-cutting. The Council’s Parks
and Gardens Committee is now to in-
vestigate the matter and prepare a
report.
The Good Oil
IyiELBOURNE, we learn, is in the grip
of an oil-racket, and we aren’t
referring to the kind that bubbles out
of the ground. Stimulated by the
migrant community, olive oil sales have
recently climbed, and it seems un-
scrupulous hands have been busy adulter-
ating the stuff. Melbourne City Council's
analyst, Dr Gilbert, re-
ported recently that olive
oil he used contained 80
per cent of inferior oils.
Prosecutions were threat-
ened.
Recently two big grocers
—Terra Self Service Pty
Ltd and A. A. Chiodo & Sons—were
charged in North Melbourne Court with
oil adulteration. Both were discharged
after producing warranties from their
suppliers. The Court held that these
warranties, accepted in good faith, pro-
tected them from prosecution under the
Health Act. A third, smaller grocer,
however, was convicted on the same
charge and fined £l5. A City Council
health inspector gave evidence that a
bottle of “peanut oil” proved to be maize
oil. The State Minister for Health, Mr
Mack, has promised he will discuss the
question of an investigation into the
rackets. Meanwhile, watch your oil.
Night of Sin?
U\)R one reason or another, the word
“sin” doesn't instantly spring to
mind at mention of the simple phrase
Coolangatta and Tweed Heads Twin
Towns Junior Chamber of Commerce.
Yet the Chamber’s apparently genteel
Jaycees have just held a “Night of Sin”
featuring a striptease act and something
described as “a female floor show” at
a Coolangatta restaurant to raise funds
for club projects.
A Brisbane Methodist minister has de-
nounced the performance from the pul-
pit, a national vice-president of the Jay-

The Bird Bath
I>eople I know built a bird bath
grand,
A stately thing of majestic dimensions,
Big enough for their own birds and
The birds of neighboring manors and
mensions
It stood on a beryl and ruby plinth,
The outer rim was Carrara marble;
Never before and never sinth
Have birds been so wealthily wooed to
warble.
At night when its candelabra gleamed
On terraces glittering with obsidian,
The head of the house came out and
beamed
With his priceless teeth and his phore-
head Phidian.
There were walks and avenues, grottoes
cool,
And bird-size paths for the birds to
strut on,
And round the rim of the central pool
Titbits of ham and chicken and mutton.
An under-privileged family of
Say four or five with another coming
Might find there lots of room to love
And sleep and live with adequate plumb-
ing.
Yet the house’s head is confused and
sad
And his family all bewildered with him;
They realise they’ve all been had,
In life they find no rhyme or rhythm,
Maybe it’s God they ought to sue,
The heresy’s almost past the uttering:
Those birds bathe hidden in the dew
In the dirty old galvanised iron gutter-
ing.
The bird bath stands within its keep
Remote, rejected, sad, deserted;
Those naughty birds cry: cheep, cheep,
cheep:
Self-centred, heartless, introverted.

PLAIN ENGLISH
When the Rhetoric Is Over
TTIE man who stole the final
A scenes of the three months’
Basic Wage drama in the Arbitra-
tion Commission was the unseen
counsel in Canberra the Com-
monwealth Statistician, Mr. K. M.
Archer. His outside submission
was that in the final three months
of last year the Australian’s aver-
age earnings went up by £2 4s. (or
by 8.9 per cent) —a figure not very
much less than the £2 12s. which
the unions want added to the basic
wage because of both productivity
gains and price increases.
The greater part of this 445. in-
crease came from increases in over-
award payments, overtime, bonuses,
and advance and retrospective pay-
ments. (The increases stemming
from the last year’s margins award
were back-dated.) Probably the
over-award, overtime and bonuses
added most. In any case, since
unions and employers agree that
productivity is increasing at some-
thing less than two per cent, and the
445. represents about an 8.9 per
cent increase, this means that at
least four years of productivity in-
creases have been taken by three
months’ wage increases!
This not only drives home the
point that the labor market settles
wages as much as, if not more than,
the Arbitration Commission, it also
poses a number of far-reaching
questions. How many times can
the same increase in productivity
be distributed in wage increases and
other benefits without rocking the
prices boat? What will be the con-
sequences if, as is generally ex-
pected, the Arbitration Commission
shortly calls on productivity for
another big hand-out? Should the
Commission’s role in wage-fixing
be recast to take more notice of
people for whom the basic wage
matters most and less of those who
are able to look after themselves
very nicely way above it?
The main point, however, is
more immediate. In view of the
increase of 445. in one quarter, one
understands why the unions’ ad-
vocate, Mr R. J. L. Hawke, should,
in his desperate final address to the
Commission, damn the employers’
offer of an average increase of 7s.
a week as “ludicrously inadequate”.
But when the rhetoric is over one
might hope that the Commission’s
award will be decided, not by
rhetoric nor even by the intelligent
debate between Mr Hawke and Mr
J. Robinson over the past twelve
weeks, but by the Commonwealth
Statistician’s proof that wages have
already gobbled up the productivity
cake for some time ahead.
Theologians and “The Pill”
YUHEN the Bishop of Woolwich
published his recent book,
“H onest To Go d”, Anglican
theologians and laity overseas de-
bated the issues it raised with great
fervor. Many important criticisms
were levelled at the book; on some
points it was clearly refuted; but no
one could say people dodged it. In
Australia, on the other hand, many
Anglican theologians tried to ignore
a book which had, at least, the merit
of arousing readers from theological
torpor.
It is now becoming clear that
this theological torpor is not only
a characteristic of Australian
Anglicans, but also of Roman
Catholics. As the article on page
34 shows, Catholic theologians in
Europe, America and Asia are
deep in controversy over whether
use of the so-called ovulation pill
is a breach of Natural Law. Some
leading theologians as well as lay-
men do not regard it as a breach
and even advocate its widespread
use.
But in Australia, although con-
ventional birth control methods are
generally assumed to be widely
used by Catholics, there was until
just recently almost no discussion
whatsoever, either in the Catholic
Press, by the clergy, or by the laity.
The Catholics seemed as theologi-
cally bankrupt on this issue, despite
its tremendous importance, as the
Anglicans were in the face of the
Bishop of Woolwich’s book. Things
may be changing now, but only
slowly.
While basically these are matters
for the Churches themselves, they
also indicate a serious weakness in
Australian intellectual life as a
whole a state of affairs that has
not received enough attention in all
the recent discussions of Australian
education.
The Croats
recent bomb outrage in
A Sydney has brought to a head
the controversy begun by THE
BULLETIN last year when it drew
attention to the activities of
Croatian Fascists in Australia —in
an article based on information
provided by democratic Croats.
Whether the bomb was prepared by
Communists, as the victim, Mr
Tomislav Lesic, believes, makes no
difference to the central issue.
The central point is that Aus-
tralia has always recognised and
will continue to recognise the right
of political asylum for foreigners of
all political views—but there is one
condition, that the refugees in
question do not break our laws. It
is no crime for a migrant to loathe
the Communist regime in Yugo-
slavia or to conduct propaganda
against it. Similarly it is no crime
to admire Tito’s dictatorship. But
there is no asylum here for any
migrant likely to engage in terrorism
in Australia —any more than there
is room outside the gaols for native
Australians who are gangsters.
After the Lesic case is cleared
up, the onus will be on the Immi-
gration Department to see that no
migrants, Communist, Fascist, or
Anarchist for that matter, who
believe in assassination, are allowed
into Australia. That surely is a
minimum political test.


THIS AUSTRALIA
MIGRANTS
The Man Who
Knew Too Much
The Petersham bombing
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
B. M. SNEDDEN
“Not accurate”
"Parliamentarians on both sides of the
A House lost their judgment last week
in the debate on the Yugoslav Croatian
problem. The basic issue was whether
political violence emanating from authori-
tarian sources, either of the Right or
Left, is to be tolerated in Australia. But
Attorney - General Billy Snedden, 37,
young by political standards and in-
experienced in that he has been a Mini-
ster only since the end of last year, made
the bad mistake of trying to score off
his Labor opponents instead of sticking
to the central theme of how the Govern-
ment proposed to cope with a situation
which was repugnant to the Australian
tradition of non-violence in politics.
Smarting, probably under the fact that
Laborite Jimmy Cairns was taking a line
which suggested that the faults were all,
or largely, on the fanatically anti-
Communist side, Snedden accused Cairns
of having spoken from the same plat-
form as prominent Victorian Communist
Ralph Gibson at a Yugoslav rally. Just
to make things worse Snedden used the
Communist paper “Tribune” as his
authority for the allegation. Cairns
could not accept that and Parliament
went chasing this hare until Snedden was
forced, rather humiliatingly, to admit
that his information was “not accurate”.
Some of Snedden’s resentment against
the way Labor handled the affair was
understandable, though nothing could jus-
tify the fact that, on an issue of such
gravity, he gratuitously raised against
Cairns a charge that was inaccurate. The
charge had two shortcomings the
major one that it was wrong and the
minor one that it had nothing whatever
to do with the central problem. Some
of Snedden’s feeling could have stemmed
from the fact that Government resources
up to the time of the Petersham bombing
(in which a Yugoslav migrant who
blamed the Communists was gravely
injured) were concentrated on surveil-
lance of the anti-Communist Croats.
Subsequent investigations have re-
vealed that while there are some very
tough political types on the non-Com-
munist side, who are not prepared to
abide by the tradition of non-violence in
the politics of their new country, there
are some equally tough political types
among those who profess themselves
anti-Fascist. As I see it, the Govern-
ment's approach should not be colored
by the fact that one side is anti-Com-
munist or that there may be Communist
sympathisers on the other side. The
Government should take the attitude that
it is against violence in any form.
Actually, Cairns may have been lucky
that Snedden diverted attention by his
inaccurate charge away from Cairns's
own actions. Cairns put on the Notice
Paper a question in which he asked;
(1) Is the Attorney-General able to say
whether the police investigating the
recent serious injury of a man by bomb
explosion in Sydney believe that the mac
who was injured was himself carryin:
the bomb in a suitcase at the time of the
explosion? (2) Can he also say whether
the police in Melbourne and Sydney re-
ceived, within a short period before the
explosion of this bomb, information that
a bomb was to be placed in the Consu-
late of Yugoslavia in Sydney?
On this Mr W. C. Wentworth told the
House of Representatives that he kne?
nothing about the truth or falsity of the
man’s charge that his injury was the
work of Communists, but “In its present
form the question is an offence against
decency which contains a particularly
vicious imputation against a man who is
lying in a Sydney hospital after having
had both legs blown off.” What Went-
worth, in effect said, was that it was to
be hoped that Cairns had much more
firm grounds for his question than
Snedden had for the charges he spon-
sored against Cairns.
CANBERRA
Hooked on State Aid
Another Angel of Death?
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
Tust as on one notable occasion, he
** announced he was looking to the
Angel of Death to solve his Victorian
political difficulties, the Federal Labor
Leader, Mr A. Calwell, last week gave
the impression that he was again looking
to an external force rather than his own
efforts to solve his problems over the
Menzies Government’s State Aid legis-
lation. On this occasion it is the Aus-
tralian Constitution instead of the Angel
of Death he wants to go to work on his
behalf.
There was real wistfulness in Mr
Calwell’s speech last week on the Menzies
legislation which provides for the split-
up of £5,000,000 for science blocks and
science training facilities between schools,
both State and private.
On August 30, 1960, Mr James (Labor,
NSW) had put to Sir Robert a question
on the subject of Commonwealth grants
to private schools. Sir Robert had
replied: “The Honorable Member puts to
me a question that is outside the juris-
diction of this Government.” In an out-
burst last week that seemed to be
designed to encourage somebody any-
body—to challenge the validity of the
Menzies legislation, Mr Calwell said that
the Prime Minister, above all men, had
the duty to explain the constitutional
position of the measure. “For nobody
has so often insisted in this House and
elsewhere that the very sort of grant this
Bill now makes is, and must be, un-
constitutional. If he still believes that
what he has said in 1960 was right, he
must either believe that his legislation
will be successfully challenged or hope
that nobody will bother to challenge it.
If somebody takes up what virtually
amounts to an invitation by Mr Calwell
to challenge the legislation in the Courts
and succeeds, Mr Calwell will un-
doubtedly breathe a sigh of relief. It will
take him —and his Party—off the hook
of trying to pretend that they are not
opposing the legislation.
In my view the best fist of Labors
difficult situation was made by Labor
speakers such as Mr K. Beazley (WAk
Mr Len Reynolds (NSW) and others who
argued that Labor's scholarship proposa 3


for all students whose parents survived a
liberal means test would have benefited
Private school systems more than the
Vlenzies proposal, even though it would
'lot involve direct State Aid.
This was a reasonable argument even
f it ignored the emotional factor which
is probably the one that attracts votes
from the supporters of State Aid to one
or other of the major parties.
As fast as Mr Calwell got his party
to skate away from the hole in the
political ice, his anti-State Aid followers
pulled him back towards it. Federal
Parliamentary Labor Party Executive
member Clyde Cameron (SA) said
blandly: “ALP policy is unequivocally
opposed to the expenditure of public
money on private schools whether Con-
ducted by religious bodies or otherwise.”
THE VOYAGER INQUIRY
The Shape of a
Question Mark?
A la recherche du temps perdu
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
SPICER, J.
“Very surprising”
A s the weeks have dragged into months
at the Voyager Royal Commission
the central questions of reference have
become lost in the columns of type and
millions of words published. The sheer
weight and the complex mosaic of the
evidence, together with the invocation
of secrecy for parts of the testimony,
have made it difficult to draw clear pat-
terns out of the published reports.
But last week the evidence of Captain
R. J. Robertson, of HMAS Melbourne,
brought the focus of the Commission
back to the central and vital question:
Just what were the movements of
HMAS Voyager and HMAS Melbourne
in the few minutes before the tragedy.
Captain Duncan Stevens of the Voya-
ger is dead, lost with 81 of his crew,
but at the Commission, his name and
reputation are protected by Mr Laurence
Street, QC, briefed by his relatives.
Captain Ronald John Robertson for
a time represented himself, before
changing his mind and making an appli-
cation for legal assistance to the Com-
monwealth. It would be unfair to
say that his experience proved the truth
of the old adage to the effect that the
man who appears for himself has a fool
for his client, but the Captain in the
early days of the Commission found
himself in some difficulties in conducting
cross-examination himself and holding
his own in the company of four QCs.
A tall, fair, gangling man, Captain
Robertson could pass for what used to be
a typical Australian, and he answered
questions in that rather clipped RAN
officer accent.
The Captain’s early evidence, led by
his own counsel, Mr David Hicks, QC,
was relatively straightforward, containing
me same catalogue of senior officers’
opinions and history of posting that had
been supplied to the Commission on all
officers. (Captain Robertson had been
at Dunkirk and also at Normandy.)
Even the cross-examination by Mr J.
Smyth, QC, assisting the Commission,
was not marked by the tension of some
earlier exchanges between Mr Smyth and
some witnesses. Captain Robertson did
complain that Mr Smyth was trying to
“pin me down” several times and showed
a tendency to answer questions by try-
ing to ask one in reply (“What's the
difference, Mr. Smyth?”).
Mr Smyth tenaciously took the Cap-
tain through parts of the 17 reports and
drafts he had made relating to the col-
lision (“My system of drafting a report
is to go on fiddling with words to get
the meaning”). The Captain had to
answer questions at length about his
decision to drop the word “unseaman-
like” in describing his opinion of the
Voyager’s manoeuvres a short time be-
fore the collision. He explained that
this decision came at draft 10 after he
had some discussion with Rear Admiral
Becher, Flag Officer Commanding the
Australian Fleet, on “being careful to use
language that would be read by people
who did not understand naval terms”.
This led Mr Smyth to ask the Cap-
tain whether he should have intervened
when he first considered that the Voya-
ger manoeuvre was not being done in
the “safest manner”. The answer was a
blunt “No". A little later, in a routine
piece of cross-examination by Mr N.
Jenkyn, QC, for the Navy, on Captain
Stevens’ record as an experienced officer,
Mr Justice Spicer cut in to ask Captain
Robertson: “Then it would be very sur-
prising to see Voyager entering into an
unseamanlike operation?” Ihe answer
was: “A little surprising”, to which the
Commissioner answered: “More than
a little very", and subsided back into
his characteristic hunched slouch in the
big chair which he keeps swivelled to
face all witnesses.
But Captain Robertson’s real test came
when Mr Street rose to question him on
behalf of the dead captain and to ques-
tion root and branch Exhibit 141 the
diagram which is Captain Robertson’s
final account of what the courses of the
two vessels were. With a pleasant show
of taut old-world courtesy, which he
does very well, Mr Street outlined the
five grounds on which he would attack
Exhibit 141, gaining the comment from
the Captain: “I wouldn’t say I under-
stand but I see what you're getting at’’.
Mr Street's attack brought out the
muddle of recollections of what was
observed on the night and reconstruc-
tions of what should have happened
afterwards, should have happened, that
is, in the minds of those trying to work
it out afterwards. With grinding atten-
tion to detail Mr Street set out to estab-
lish that Voyager could not have behaved
in the way shown on the Captain's dia-
gram. His question: “Are you reluctant
to agree to the difference?” on matters of
times remembered brought a flurry of
objections from Mr Hicks and Mr Jen-
kyns, and a comment from Mr Justice
Spicer to the latter: “I don't understand
why you should interfere. This is not
your witness".
The remembrance of times past could
well be a sub-title for the Commission
because so much of the conflict over re-
collections and reconstructions depends
on differing times (and one vital log, that
of the tactical operator's radio-telephone
messages hinges on a wristlet watch
without minute marks).
Voyager’s course in the last five min-
utes could perhaps be best explained by
thinking of the shape of a question
mark, with the destroyer moving from
the bottom. The issue for the Commis-
sion is at just what angle Voyager turned
into the bulge of the question mark,
away from Melbourne before swinging
back to port and the collision.
In his first two reports on the collision,
Captain Robertson had described Voya-
ger’s turn away from Melbourne as being
30 degrees to starboard. Later he was
to change it to 45 degrees. It was on
this fundamental difference that Mr
Street directed much of his cross-exami-
nation over what he called “the reliability
of the diagram" (i.e., Exhibit 141).
If the Commissioner does not accept
Captain Robertson's calculations, then a
lot of reconstruction evidence from the
Melbourne, already supporting those
calculations, will have to be set aside.
While the Captain's testimony will
(with the exception of one officer, not
at present available) end the evidence
on the collision, the Commission still
faces a long task on its final term of
reference: search and rescue operations.

H. BOLTE
“Grave-digger”

*- Showroom in Melbourne’s Southern

;rave dug by the Bolte Government
diich in pushing through the Goods
Stamp Trading) Act, 1964, has shot to
lieces the well devised scheme of
Modern Retail Merchandising Pty Ltd
|o carry on stamp trading in Victoria.
When MRM discovered it was treading
t thin legal line in promoting a three-
iarty system (see The Bulletin, March
-1), it switched the design to a two-
>arty one in which coupons would be
:xchanged for gifts in the shops of the
etailers issuing them instead of in
SRM’s gift shops. But without any
>ressure from anybody, even the Retail
rraders’ Association of Victoria, the
jovernment effectively blocked the move
V. in effect, making all trading schemes
1 legal.
This brought Victorian legislation into
ine with South Australia, where in 1937
i Parliamentary Commission of In-
quiry’s recommendation to prohibit stamp
•fading was acted on, and also with
Queensland and WA. Now Tasmania
(where three party systems alone are
barred) and NSW (where there is no
legislation at all on the matter) are the
only States still open to stamp trading
companies. It is odd that none have yet
appeared in NSW.
While stamp trading failed to get off
the ground in Victoria, argument still
waxes on the rights and wrongs of the
business and even the Institute of
Economic Affairs in Britain has recently
published a book by Christian Fulop,
who after a lot of research comes out
strongly in their favor at a time when
much of the shouting and ballyhoo on
the subject has died down and the main
hare-chasing in the UK’s retail trade
field has been switched to retail price
maintenance.
When Mrs Fulop started collecting
evidence about a year ago, she was under
the impression “that trading stamps were
one more device for making the market
even more imperfect than it is.” Re-
search, however, indicated that they were
comparable with premium offers —“free”
gifts, “free” competitions, rebates, co-
operative dividends, “free” delivery, mail
order, and many other special services
and inducements offered by manufac-
turers and retailers in an effort to attract
trade for their own goods or to their own
shops. In fact the book makes a clear
defence of trading stamps and argues
that shoppers should be left free to
choose the type of store and service they
prefer. Mrs Fulop found no evidence
that trading stamps tend automatically to
lead to higher prices.
Arguments that prices have to be raised
to cover the extra cost of the stamps look
quite untenable, for how can the retailers
who offer stamps hope to raise prices
while their competitors, detesting such
schemes, are cutting the retail mark-up
and offering cheaper goods? Admittedly
stamp companies interpose themselves
as yet other middlemen in the factory to
consumer chain, but this is not to say
that prices need necessarily be made
higher. At any rate, the housewife who
gets the ‘‘gifts” is in clover.
THE CROATS
ffijiuiLetCn
80 Years Ago: May 24, 1884
'Jhere is heavy trouble brewing in
Europe. It is in Spain and in
Croatia, where the peasantry and
plebs are steeped in deepest ignorance,
that insurrections occur. In Russia the
peasantry have not even arrived at
the stage of intelligence when men
reason about evils which they feel.
Sydney Coffee Palace Co. was
started about three years ago with
a great flourish. The Palaces were
to “supply a long-felt want” of a
restaurant where young men could
obtain a superior luncheon or tea
without being exposed to the tempta-
tion of intoxicating liquors and pot-
house society. Men of all ages rushed
to the Palaces to lead better lives
under the influence of godly soup and
pious pickles. The dining-rooms were
filled with the odour of sausages and
sanctity. Hundreds of men, who had
never dreamed of getting drunk at
luncheon, became regular customers,
but presently began to long for beer
with a longing created by the feeling
that beer was prohibited. Business
began to decline. The dividend was
not satisfactory, and shareholders
grumbled. So they reduced the size
of the glass of milk. More re-
lapsed into sin. This sent the divi-
dends down again. Then the soul-
saving business was abandoned and
the reformers sold the lease and good-
will to a —yes, to a publican.
THE KIMBERLEYS
The Man from
the East
The Worst drought for years
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
Sydney builder Eric Clementson, who
made a killing in his first venture into
West Australia’s cattle industry, is run-
ning into trouble in the Kimberleys.
He made £74,000, perhaps £50,000 of
it clear profit, from the sale of interests
in stations and meat-works to Project
Development Corporation, of which he
is managing director. But now the Kim-
berleys are experiencing one of the
worst droughts on record, and stations
are counting their losses in thousands of
head.
Clementson’s early publicised target
was 70,000 head of cattle to be pro-
cessed this year. Even in Derby he has
said he hopes to get in 40,000. To make
sure he gets the cattle in, Clementson has
stopped truckers from bringing cattle
both to his meatworks and to the port
for export to other abattoirs. He insists
on an all-or-nothing arrangement. Local
station people have countered by
buying big transports to side-step this
manoeuvre.
Kimberley people, bitter at Clement-
son’s methods and the fact that he has
parted company with several of his top
men (and their local knowledge), claim
he will be lucky to get 15,000 head of
cattle into his meatworks this season.
Three top men in the project have
been sacked recently and another key
figure, a locally popular station manager
has resigned.

lative Council. There is little doubt this
approval will be given following the
tabling in Council last week of one of
the most socially significant documents
ever put before an Australian legislature.
The document was the eagerly awaited
Report of the Council's Select Commit-
tee of 12 men appointed last February,
to inquire into the Social Welfare Bill
which seeks to remove the restrictions
formerly imposed on 17,000 NT full
bloods the most far-reaching Bill of
its kind every proposed in Australia.
The Select Committee prepared its
Report after hearing 200 witnesses from
the Arafura to the Centre. It covers
every aspect of native life in the Terri-
tory. The Committee found all the tra-
ditional fears about the white man re-
garding the black were trotted out for a
flogging, during the course of evidence.
It said opposition to the Social Welfare
Bill seemed to be based on “genuine
fears of the consequences, personal fears
relating to a belief that complete relaxa-
tion of restrictions would bring about an
increase in crimes committed by Abori-
gines and economic fears that Aborigines
of inferior ability would have to be paid
wages equal to workmen of superior
abilities.”
The most vehement critics of the Social
Welfare Bill were cattlemen who made
dire predictions about the result of native
drinking and of their having to pay “in-
ferior” workmen higher wages. The
Committee had other ideas and was not
at all taken with the two quid a week
and tucker which applies to many native
stockmen in the- Territory.
Some witnesses had piously declared
that if Aborigines were paid full wages
many would not be employed. This drew
the tart comment from the Committee
that it “does not accept that a lack of
application and skill exhibited by some
'adividuals in the present environment
evidence of lack of educability or
employability of their race”.
The policy of Mr C. E. Barnes’
e Partment of Territories also came
in for some criticism when the Commit-
tee remarked that “those administering
the welfare policy appeared to have con-
cerned themselves primarily with food
and clothing, and to wages only as a
sort of subsidiary payment to take care
of the limited needs outside food, accom-
modation and clothing”. Natives’ wages
did not appear to have been assessed as
were other wages against the background
of the economy. The Committee urged
an immediate survey of employment
opportunities for Aborigines and a posi-
tive scheme for increased employment
of natives at the present level of skill.
This should be administered by the
Department of Labor and National Ser-
vice through local inspectors. It would
like to see the assessment of native em-
ployment opportunities completed within
two years. It also sought greater oppor-
tunities for native employment in
Government Departments and a crash
programme to absorb native labor in-
cluding development of fishing, timber
milling, reafforestation, tanning, agricul-
ture, native crafts and other industries.
The crux of successful native integra-
tion and the key to the general rise in
native living standards will be education
and the Committee recommended educa-
tion and health responsibilities should be
controlled by the relevant specialist
Departments and not by the Director of
Welfare. Legislation should make it
compulsory for all Aboriginal children
to attend school between the ages of five
and fifteen and that the Government’s
aim, should also be to eliminate the spe-
cial curriculum for Aborigines.
Reactions to the Report were surpris-
ingly mild considering the thousands of
emotional words which the Committee
had heard in the course of evidence. It
had gone some way to meet cattlemen’s
fears about the results of native drinking
in remote pastoral areas; it recommended
that cattlemen should be able to apply to
have part or all of their properties declar-
ed “restricted areas” under law where the
station manager would legally be able
to ban liquor. The Committee said it
did not believe that the conduct of some
natives when drunk was inherent but
arose from lack of self-discipline siem-
ming from circumstances in which many
Aborigines found themselves.
Generally speaking the Committee’s
attitude can be summed up with this
paragraph from its Report: “Even though
there may be a period of adjustment
during which less sophisticated Abori-
gines may be troublesome, most of the
fears expressed, and particularly those
relating to the lifting of restrictions on
the consumption of alcohol, should prove
to be unfounded.”


ADDS
£52 MILLION
TO MEMBERS POLICIES
A.M.P. has fixed its bonus distribution rate
for 1963—a record year in which it issued
new insurance policies at the rate of more
than £8 million a week. The total amount of
free insurance added to members’ policies will
be more than £52,000,000. A.M.P. is a
mutual office owned entirely by its policy-
holders and operated solely for their benefit.
£449 MILLION IN CLAIMS PAID
Claims paid by A.M.P. now total £449,765,000.
At the end of 1963 there were 2,676,842 policies
in force.
MORE THAN £1 MILLION A WEEK
INVESTED IN AUSTRALIA
Last year Australia benefited by just over £57
million in new A.M.P. investments. In addition,
£NZ13,400,000 was invested in New Zealand and
£5tg.2,500,000 in the United Kingdom. At the end
of 1963 A.M.P. had £659,000,000 invested.

SWING TO LIFE INSURANCE AS AN INVESTMENT
Reporting record new business to the Annual Meeting of
Members of the Society in Sydney, the Chairman of the
Principal Board, Mr. C. G. Crane, said: “The Society main-
tained its record as the largest underwriter of life insurance
business in the Southern Hemisphere. The total new sums
insured written for 1963 amounted to almost £419 500 000
£53,000,000 more than in 1962. A number of facts have con-
tributed to the remarkable growth in the sale of life insurance
by the Society. These include the expansion and development
of the economies of Australia and New Zealand and the growing
recognition of the sound protection and investment benefits
which life insurance offers. There has also been rapid expansion
of our operations in Britain, where the Society’s contracts are
proving very popular. Competition in life insurance is always
keen, however, and has been intensified in recent years by
the entry of new companies, including many from overseas.
Even so, the Society last year clearly maintained its leader-
ship, and indeed actually increased its share of the total
market in Australia. This is due not only to the attractive
contracts offered but also to the effective service available
to prospective and existing policyholders through the Society’s
field representatives.”

SECTS
How Mr Wearne
Lost His Shirt
The Scientologists’ plot to take over Australia?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
J. W. GALBALLY
“Laughing stock”
Dome amazing evidence has been given
at Victoria’s Board of Inquiry into
Scientology since the hearings resumed
in February. A taxi driver described an
incident in his life 11,767 years ago
which resulted in his death and a sub-
sequent visit to Heaven. A housewife
claimed Scientology had cured her
lumbago and a draftsman said it had
fixed his poisoned leg. A painter
described a space trip lasting 6,000 light
years and a former school teacher told
of his experiences in a laboratory on
Mars. (He was employed on radiating
red creatures “like crayfish” to stop them
breeding.) It was possibly these, and
other tales, which lead to the Labor
Leader in the Upper House, Mr Gal-
bally, to say recently that the inquiry
was the laughing stock of Victoria.
However, recently the inquiry came
down to earth for a time. Mr Philip Ben-
nett Wearne has been occupying the
witness box and he might be described,
in all fairness, as an anti-Scientologist.
Mr Wearne at one time published a chain
of trade union and Labor papers
stretching through SA, Victoria and
NSW. At the moment he is publicity
officer for the Committee for Mental
Health and National Security which is
dedicated to fighting Scientology and all
its works.
Before the collapse of his publishing
empire there was a great deal of specu-
lation as to how much Mr Wearne was
making out of it, apart from the com-
missions earned by his horde of adver-
tising salesmen. The Victorian ALP,
which ultimately severed its connection
with Mr Wearne, never knew.
On oath at the Inquiry, Wearne said
that he had made profits in excess of
£20,000 from 1957 to 1960, and
employed about 100 people. For the year
1959-60 his income had been £27,418
and in this period his spending on liquor
and entertainment ran at between
£3OOO and £4OOO a year. At times, he
spent £lOO a week on liquor alone.
Mr Wearne told the Inquiry he had
lost his business empire through Scien-
tology. At the moment he has Supreme
Court proceedings going against the
Scientologists for loss of business income
amounting to about £lOO,OOO.
Wearne claimed that he first came into
touch with the Scientologists in Sydney
in 1951 and he parted company with
them in March or April, 1963. He
claimed that he was the only person
he knew of who had ever been subjected
to Scientology treatment and subsequent-
ly managed to break with the organisa-
tion.
Mr Wearne said he became really
involved deeply in Scientology after a
Roger Meadmore called on him in Mel-
bourne in 1958. Meadmore drew his
interest by emphasising the contribution
Scientology could make to salesmanship.
Its “cycle of action” was method of
delivering a talk without interruption
from the prospective client. Wearne was
interested in improving his salesmanship
and this drew him into the vortex.
He described long hours of processing
he had received during his Scientology
phase. During one processing session he
had an hallucination that in a past life
he had been caught in a giant spider
web and was eaten by a 40-foot spider.
He had also developed severe pains in
the back, stomach and head, but Scien-
tology practice forbad him to consult a
doctor. It was only after he had broken
with the organisation that he went to
a doctor who cured his complaints
“within minutes”.
He also told of Scientology training
sessions known as “TR drills”. In these,
groups of people were placed under the
physical command of instructors who
issued orders “Look at that wall. Walk
to that wall. Touch that wall” and so on.
Sometimes the sessions were in reverse
with the pupil under instructions to resist
the commands. In one of these, Mr
Wearne said, his shirt had been removed
from him.
Mr Wearne also outlined to the Inquiry
a theme he has developed in publications
distributed to members of Parliament
and others of influence. This is his belief
that the Scientologists are operating a
long-range plan slowly to fill Govern-
ment positions with their devotees and
ultimately to take over control of the
Commonwealth Government. It is to
counter these moves that Mr Wearne has
formed the Committee for Mental
Health and National Security.
After he finished, the Inquiry resum-
ed hearing accounts of Scientology
miracles. A witness explained how pro-
cessing enabled one to shed, or add,
30 lbs weight at will.
TOURISM
Cavill Ay. Castros
“It all savors of
racial discrimination”
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
old Coast tempers, hot at any time,
threatened to split the tourist mecca
last week. The row followed the Gold
Coast City Council election in which
Mayor Alderman Ern. Harley beat Coast
tourist mogul Bernie Elsey hollow. The
defeat raised again the long-standing
rumble, which Mayor Harley has denied,
that the Council favors Southport more
than the rest of the Coast.
Southport is the big business centre
at the Coast’s northern tip and it has
the big voting population. Further on,
and down to Coolangatta on the New
South Wales border, is Surfers Paradise
and the tourist strip. Mr Elsey cam-
paigned on the platform of greater spend-
ing on tourism, while Alderman Harley
campaigned for balanced development,
including roads, drains, and other basics
which the permanent residents want.
The fear that the new City Council,
after Alderman Harley’s strong win,
would make the strip from Surfers to
Coolangatta worse off than before, pre-
cipitated a trade war led by Mr Elsey. A
trade boycott on Southport business
houses by interests south of Southport
was started and one estimate was that
£30,000 worth of business had gone
south. Mr Elsey announced he would
hire only people living south of South-
port and said he would send a mobile
public address system through South-
port and Surfers urging people not to
buy in Southport.
Alderman Harley commented on the
boycott: “It all savors of racial dis-
crimination”. He claimed that a group
of Surfers Paradise businessmen were
“Cavill Avenue Castros” Cavill
Avenue being the main street of Surfers.
He urged the Coast to stay together.
As it turned out, Ern. Harley won
again. The mobile public address system
move was a bit of a flop, and anti-boycott
businessmen of Surfers succeeded last
week in breaking further boycott pro-
posals. It would be surprising, though,
if Bernie Elsey dropped his personal
boycott for a long time, anyway.

Too Many Plans and
Not Enough Action
The state of Australia’s roads
By RICHARD HALL
The roads of Australia probably com-
prise the most written and most
talked about subject in the nation.
With 2,500,000 cars on the roads, to-
gether with about 1,000,000 commercial
vehicles and new registrations running
at the rate of 300,000 a year, the obses-
sion is natural enough. But the Austra-
lian has to pick his way through a medley
of conflicting facts and figures over the
future of our roads. Headlines threaten
imminent crises and traffic freeze-ups on
the highways.
Then, month after month and year
after year plans are produced; five-year-
plans, ten-year-plans, six - year - plans.
There are the State Governments’ plans,
the Federal Government’s plans, county
plans, Lord Mayors’ plans, professors’
plans, American experts’ plans. There
are calls for more taxes and for less
taxes. But what the motorist proceeding
jerkily along a main city highway during
peak hours or caught behind a semi-
trailer on an interstate road could be
justified in feeling is that there have
been too many plans and too little
action. The authorities involved would
agree vigorously with him and then pro-
ceed to differ among themselves.
Revenue for roads in Australia comes
from the three revenue-raising authori-
ties: local government, States and, above
all, the Commonwealth. Tolls have only
been used in Australia over the last few
generations for special purposes and
governments show little enthusiasm for
any sweeping introductions of toll roads.
In NSW there will be tolls on sections
of the new Sydney-Newcastle highway
under construction.
As in so many other fields, the Com-
monwealth's role in road financing has
rapidly increased in the last decade and
major policy decisions to be made this
year will decide the pattern in the de-
cade to come, which is a vital one for
Australia’s road development.
But the policy decisions look like be-
ing controversial ones because they will
come in that delicate field of Common-
wealth-State relations.
Mr. Holt stressed that the new Bureau
would not be a construction body but
an advisory one; the question is just how
strong its advisory powers will be.
The answer will depend to a large extent
on what form it takes. One proposal put
forward and obviously favored by one
of the most influential organisations in-
volved, the 1,450,000-strong Australian
Automobile Association, is for a body
something like the Australian Universi-
ties Commission. The placing of the
third university in Victoria was recent
dramatic proof that the Universities
Commission has played a quite strong
role in determining priorities. A similai
body for roads could have a full-time
chairman and part-time members, ua-

committed to special interests. This form
of organisation is better than the repre-
sentative kind which becomes unwieldy,
through being overloaded with special
departmental and States interests.
TV/Ir Holt’s speech to the assembled
■*-*-*■ Premiers in Canberra made it clear
that the odds are for the smaller body. He
also went out of his way to stress that
one of the reasons for the Commonwealth
Government setting up such a body was
to sit in judgment on conflicting claims.
In doing so he cast a reflection on the
National Association of Australian State
Road Authorities, NAASRA, when he
said that “the views and representations
put to us all stress particular and, in the
nature of the case, sectional aspects of
the problem. The Commonwealth must
. . . make a competent and reliable
appraisal of its own.”
In doing that Mr Holt was calling into
question an elaborate set of submissions
prepared by the States and the Common-
wealth’s own Department of Works on
Australia’s road needs for the next ten
years. These submissions released in
October last year called for an expendi-
ture of £3,615,000,000 in the next 10
years.
Published in a glossy booklet, they
put forward a pessimistic estimate of a
deficiency of £1,165,000,000 in the
coming decade. However, appreciations
by Treasury and other Commonwealth
departmental offices strongly attacked
the basis of the States’ calculations.
NAASRA was criticised for making
inaccurate estimates of the possible in-
flationary pressures and some States were
under fire for having tampered with road
classifications so as to inflate figures.
The difference between the States and
Commonwealth is well illustrated by the
huge difference in the background brief-
ing figure prepared for Mr Holt, contem-
plating an expenditure on roads from all
sources for the next five years at more
than £llOO million, which was £430 mil-
lion behind the NAASRA estimate of
needs.
It was on the'advice of the same offi-
cials that the Prime Minister, Sir Robert
Menzies, laid down to the States the
terms of the Commonwealth-State Road
Agreement for the next five years. This,
which has been going through Parlia-
ment this month, allows the States a
basic £375 million with another £45
million for special grants mainly for
developmental roads. Not only was this
greeted with unanimous cries of “too
little” from the States but the arbitrary
way of imposing the figure on the States
without discussion of either plans or
proposals put up by the States on figures
and on adjustments to the system of
allocating funds to the States caused
bitterness.
While the Commonwealth figure repre-
sents a 60 per cent increase on the lasi
five years (and of course a huge increase
on the first Commonwealth grant of £2
million way back in 1931) already there
are calls for a review. The Secretary-
General of the Australian Automobile
Association, Mr L. Strudwick (whose
organisation is warmly disposed to the
proposed Commonwealth Bureau) pre-
dicts that it will have to recommend fresh
grants before the five years are up.
Another authority, Professor Blunden
(who holds the Chair of Traffic Engineer-
ing at the University of NSW), is more
outspoken: “There will have to be a
supplementary road budget in the nexl
five years. To mark time now could
put Melbourne and Sydney alone in a
position they’ll never recover from.”
At present, of the money given to the
States by the Commonwealth 40 per cent
must be spent on rural roads and 60
per cent on State highways, main roads
and metropolitan roads. This provides
an imbalance in favor of the rural roads.
Some States have meddled with their
classifications to bring highways under
the “rural” road class, which has been
another reason for Commonwealth mis-
trust of States.
Tn the significant change in Australian
Automobile Association tactics over
the last few years from declamatory-typ e
statements to more sophisticated lobby-
ing techniques, there has been less talk
about the petrol tax issue. On figure
supplied by the Commonwealth Govern-


How the
Hongkong Hilton
beats the
water shortage
Water is a problem throughout
Hong Kong, but not at the
Hongkong Hilton. The hotel
has huge storage tanks for
drinking water and its own
wells for bath water. The air-
conditioning and sanitation
systems use sea water.
So the Hongkong Hilton won’t
ever run out of water—but if it
did there’d still be plenty of
Australian beer. And you'll find
Australian beef in the
restaurants; blankets of
Australian lamb’s wool; even a
special Australian Room,
featuring Australian materials
and objets d’art.
The Hongkong Hilton is right
at the heart of Hong Kong's
major business and govern-
mental district. There are three
famous restaurants. And
fifty of the finest free port
shops have branches right in
the hotel’s arcade.

ment the petrol tax gap over the next
five years will virtually be closed. Their
estimate of petrol tax revenue in that
period is £430 million. But this figure,
like every other one, is challenged.
But even if the gap were closed there
would still not be enough money to meet
needs, hence the growing pressure for
a form of special petrol tax. At present
petrol tax is at llfd. a gallon.
The Victorian Premier, Mr Bolte, has
supported the principle of extra petrol
tax specifically levied for roads uses and
the NSW Minister for Highways, Mr
Hills, has also spoken in favor of such
a tax.
While the motorists’ organisations
have came out against an extra petrol
tax (the AAA speaking of a “soak the
motorist” policy), thosq who support it
are confident that the motorist would
pay up gratefully if he could be sure it
would be devoted to improvement of
roads. At present the supporters of an
increase point out
that the Australian
motorist pays pro-
portionately less tax
than in other ad-
vanced countries. In
New Zealand the
tax is Is. 9id. out of
4s. lid. a gallon, and
in England 3s. sid.
out of ss. sd.
But, as the Prime
Minister firmly indi-
cated to Mr Bolte,
any increase in tax
would be a very hot political issue. Not
only would the motoring organisations be
up in arms, but industry and commerce
would have to bear extra costs. A sur-
vey on roads needs for 1960-70 for the
States showed an extra 6d. a gallon
tax but after the NAASRA submissions
on their predicted deficits an increase
would have to be much more. One figure
put forward by Mr Hills, although he
did not commit himself to it, was an
extra 12fd., a staggering increase which
would cause uproar.
It is doubtful whether any government
would dare increase a tax by that much.
But, still, if the authorities are right and
there is a supplementary budget for roads
it is hard to see the extra money coming
from anywhere except the petrol tax.
The Treasury, however, is ■ firmly op-
posed to the notion of a special tax as
setting a precedent. Any petrol tax in-
crease would also run into the conflicting
interests of the States and the present
dispute over the basis of allocation.
The bitterness of the larger States has
something to warrant it in the figures.
At present NSW gets 16s. 7d. back of
every pound collected in petrol tax in
the State and Victoria gets 13s. 2d.
This contrasts with 41s. lOd. for every
pound in Western Australia, 30s. sd. for
Tasmania and 255. sd. for Queensland.
The new Bureau will have to pick its
way through the conflict between rural
and metropolitan interests. At present
the 40 per cent allocation for rural roads,
excluding the highways, suits the Country
Party very well and any recommendation
for a change in that is likely to run into
strong political opposition.
The real crisis facing Australian roads
is in the cities. In a submission to the
Commonwealth Government in January
this year the Lord Mayors of the capital
cities painted a gloomy picture of the
future. They said unless the metropoli-
tan areas received more Commonwealth
aid in the next five years “the worst pre-
dictions of traffic congestion and chaos
are destined to become reality. In a
relatively short time many main and
minor thoroughfares will become
clogged.”
The Lord Mayors’
submission lays
stress on the cost of
traffic delays to the
nation’s economy. It
quotes an estimate
from the Australian
Road Research
Board that traffic
delays are costing
the nation some-
where between £2OO
million and £4OO
million a year.
Not only is the
cost of delays to be taken into account
but also the cost of road accidents on
inadequate main roads in the city. In
Sydney the accident rate is 38 per cent
higher than the rest of the State. In
Melbourne 87 per cent of the arterial
roads have an accident rate above the
average.
Evidence is put forward to prove
that better roads can help the accident
rate in figures for the South-Eastern
Freeway in Melbourne. In its first year

sured at 6 per 10,000,000 vehicle miles
compared with 45, 19, 74 and 54 per
10,000,000 vehicle miles on adjacent

The most urgent works listed for the
six capital cities run to between £154
and £164 million and this only counts
roads that are needed in the next decade.
Melbourne’s share of that figure comes
to £46,000,000 alone. The Sydney
figure of between £SO and £6O million
takes no account of a new harbor
bridge.
Costs for metropolitan road improve-
ments are bedevilled by resumption pay-

third of the cost of 1.5 miles has gone

While the inner city work force is
now becoming stable, a new problem
is developing—the movement of workers
to new industrial areas or new commer-
cial centres. This means that suburban
arterial roads are assuming an impor-
tance that the planners of twenty years
ago had not allowed for.
While the Commonwealth suspicions
about NAASRA might be justified, it is
difficult, looking at the Melbourne and
Sydney programmes in the Lord Mayors’
submission, to see how they might be
cut back.
Brisbane, according to one of the most
thorough surveys yet carried out in Aus-
tralia, urgently needs a large-scale dis-
tributor road and a new bridge.
In Adelaide and Perth the situation is
not so pressing, but Perth has lately
been debating its road plan, which will
need £l9 million in the next ten years.
One of the recurring themes in talk
about the roads crisis in the metropolitan
areas is the scope for revival of public
transport. The first problem here
confronting governments has been that
for years departmental interests have
conflict and that no clear facts have
been put together. This, over the last
few years, has finally led to surveys in
the capital cities. Brisbane has had one
and one is in progress for Melbourne.
But Sydney in 1964 has still not had a
comprehensive transport survey. De
Leuw Cather, the American firm of
engineers and road experts, has carried
out a survey of the Eastern Suburbs only.
Australia already in its capital cities
has a high utilisation of public transport
for travel into the inner city area. In
Sydney it is surprising to learn that less
than 20 per cent of those who work in
the inner city area use their cars to come
to work. But the problem of the move-
ment across the suburbs and through the
city to and from work, as well as the
commercial traffic which must go by
road, is as much a factor as the com-
muters. So there is no easy solution in
a return to public transport.
is some wider scepticism express-
A ed for some of the plans for vast
highway developments. Australia has so
far avoided the worst American excesses
of the takeover of the inner city areas
and the plans do lay stress on trying to
get traffic around rather than through
the city centre. Some of the scepticism
expressed in Australia has been directed
at De Leuw Cather, who have done
expressway surveys for Sydney and Perth
as well as a traffic survey in Canberra.
Their report for Sydney recommended
additions to the existing plans which
would bring the cost of the whole ex-
pressway system to £2OO million. As-
pects of their report have been criticised
since. The most severe open criticism
came from the Chief County Planner
of the Cumberland County Council, Mr
R. Fraser, who accused the report of
‘‘bordering on salesmanship” and attack-
ed much of the data of its long-range
predictions.
In the United States the huge high-
way contracts have helped build up a
formidable highway construction firm
lobby.
This then is the sort of problem that
the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads
will have to look at. But if it comes up
with reports in conflict with what the
States have committed themselves to,
the stage' is set for Commonwealth-State
clashes. The differences between the
Commonwealth and the States over the
NAASRA reports could well be the
beginning of contests that could drag
on for years.

OUT AND ABOUT
Just Like the Good
Old Days
“They made me out to be so sad..."
By CHARLES HIGHAM
It was just like the good old days, when
Stars Were Stars. Long before Judy
Garland flew into Sydney, she had
been given the complete buildup: a few
minutes only would be granted to the
Press at the airport, every interview—
Press, radio and TV would have to be
crammed into 90 minutes at her hotel
suite and only 40 people would be ad-
m.tted. She would only give three
performances in the entire country, with
sky-high prices charged Few entertain-
ers, these days, would dare to be so lm-
- ’ ...... x ,
penous: one was wh.sked back to the
era of Gable, Garbo, Lu.se Ra.ner and
assie '
The tour s stage management was in-
spired, and so was the star’s entry at
the Press conference. She might have
been a great actress in a Broadway show,
walking onto the stage: a handsome male
bit-player (Mark Herron) at her elbow,
cameras flashing, champagne and caviar
in the offing, white as her dress with
tension and laughing raucously as she
stretched out her hands in greeting.
A performance certainly, and for the
next 90 minutes she never stopped act-
ing> i wa tched the tired, thin, 41-year-old
woman as she talked rather too loudly,
gjggled shakilyj and did her best tQ
with a barrage of sometimes igno rant or
in . mannered ques tions. The fascination
was the cruel one of seeing a legend
stripped of Technicolor los ° s and *
tence> Hers had b£en the dassic H *,
uu u r
wood myth career, the child born of
vaudevi „ e nt si j .. Jingle Bells”
on stage t3O momhs> £orcing - her way
into a sisters act at the age of three,
winning a screen contract with a ren-
dition of “Dinah” and running through
two decades of screen history from “The
Wizard of Oz” to “I Could Go On Sing-
ing”.
Three broken marriages> breakdowns,
comebacks, slashed wrists in a locked
bathroom all, in a way, like a Davis
or Crawford vehicle. At the Chevron
Hilton, skinny and blinking like a chicken
just released from the shell, she looked
as though all the defences were down.
The conference was a shambles: the
40 chosen people squeezed into a kind
of high-life Black Hole of Calcutta, spil-
ling champagne, grumbling over dead-
lines and jostling around Judy Garland
like a football scrum. Despite all this
and her obvious exhaustion after a
bumpy flight from Hawaii (“We stopped
down in Pago Pago. It was hot and
sticky. Ugh!”), the star managed to con-
vey a great deal of the humor, vitality
and charm of her screen appearances.
The eyes are an insomniac’s, huge, bril-
liant and dark; the mouth is twisted with
bitterness, and the neck taut with strain.
It’s a face like an open wound, and much
of Judy Garland's attraction comes from
this vulnerability, this need to be protect-
ed and cherished.
Impossible to look at her with detach-
ment, to appraise her as one might a
Doris Day or a Shirley Bassey. Sen-
timentally, one associates her with eager
early adolescence and with every Girl
Next Door. In snatches of conversation
with her in the corner of the room,
shouting across the din of that horrible
party, I sensed her responsiveness, quick
humor and humanity, and the pain of
being Judy Garland. She and her pianist-
arranger of the last few years, a soft-
spoken and intelligent man named Mort
Lindsey, filled in the picture.
She is incapable of giving two con-
secutive performances, or more than
two in a week; any more would exhaust
her, and at the end of the show she is
finished, beaten-up as Mort Lindsey
says, “like a prizefighter”. I wasn't sur-
prised to learn from her that she has
never had a musical training of any kind,
that she has no sense of true pitch, and
that she can’t read a score. She had, she
said, to feel with the lyrics of a song
before she could sing it, to sense that
those lyrics were an expression of some-
thing she had experienced or felt, and
that in a way she was spilling out her
private emotions into song.
This lack of technical polish, this
directness of emotion, is what one
always associates with her as a performer.
“Unlike most singers,” Mort Lindsey
told me, “she doesn't wait in the dres-
sing-room until it's time for her to go
on the stage.
“She has to stand in the wings or
somewhere she can hear the sound of
the band, get a reaction from it. Only
when she hears that band can she work
herself up to the point when she can face
an audience.”
In her latest picture, “I Could Go On
Singing,” Judy played a role not far

from herself, of a singer fighting
emotional crises to make a hit on the
London stage. I asked her about the
film, and she agreed that it had been
designed to echo her own career. Dirk
Bogarde, her co-star, had, she said,
written the script with her collaboration,
because the original screenplay (officially
credited to Mayo Simon) hadn’t worked
out. “Several people were involved in
the writing,” she said. “I know of at
least three one of them in the south
of France. I never met them! So Dirk
went ahead and made it up as we went
along.
“Yes, the film does represent me
truthfully. You see, I do stand there, in
the wings, waiting for the band. I have
to, to get into the the mood to
hit that spotlight ...” I asked her if the
so-called autobiography of Judy Garland,
recently printed in McCall’s magazine,
had told her story as truthfully as the
film, and she made a face. She didn’t
like it? “I didn’t write it! They just used
my name! They made me out to be so
sad, always sobbing and crying and
sorry for myself. It was just miserable. I
didn’t know about it; didn’t know what
they were doing . . .’’ And, oddly enough,
she had never heard of the novel “Inside
Daisy Clover”, by Gavin Lambert, sug-
gested by her career and shortly to be
filmed with Natalie Wood in the Gar-
land-like central role . . .
I found her unwilling to talk about the
past, the years in the MGM salt mines,
(“It was tough for all of us, not just
for me, we were all driven . . .”) and
she preferred to discuss her future plans.
She said she saw her future in Europe,
rather than America, and spoke harshly
of the “old egotistical mould” of Holly-
wood. She said she’d like to make a film
in Europe (her recent “Judgment at
Nuremberg”, made in America, had
had a European setting) and a new play
in which she would appear with Mark
Herron, a two-character comedy called
“The Owl and The Pussycat” (which she
likened to “The Lourposter”) would be
produced in London first, not New York.
On the whole, she made it clear she felt
happier in a European atmosphere than
an American one.
Australia, of course, was neither
Europe nor America, and she con-
fessed some curiosity about what made
us tick. At the Press conference, her
wonder must have deepened, and she
made some half-heartedly critical, half-
joking remarks about the Press from
the Stadium stage. But her audience in
the Stadium, as wholeheartedly kind and
nostalgic as any at the London Pal-
ladium, must have reassured her. Tos-
sing complaints about the stage equip-
ment (“It's like landmines!’’), sending
herself up (“You know I am just a
great big, silver screen star!”), or chid-
ing past reporters (“You can’t be in
show business for 102 years and still be
drunk all the time!”), she hit her own
nail on the head with “I’m a moving
target and they’re always after me!”
Often, as she sang, sometimes roughly,
sometimes brilliantly, numbers ranging
from the inspired (Harold Aden’s “Man
That Got Away”) to the tiresome (“Love
of My Life”) she looked like just that
moving target, nervously dodging the
world’s barbs. But in the Stadium at
least, surrounded with a solid wall of
nostalgic rapture, she had absolutely
nothing to worry about.

Stocktaking in Queensland
Rugby League selectors are rarely sentimental
By DISCUS
The winds of change may be less than
a zephyr so far in Queensland
Rugby League circles, but it is an
improvement to find some stocktaking in
progress there. Rather different to Barry
Muir's “when the chips are down” state-
ment before the interstate match last
year, Brisbane opinion seems to be that
the Queensland team has no hope against
NSW this year. And an expert commen-
tator, Jack Reardon, has made the very
sensible suggestion that the selectors
should lace the team with the best of
the young players, giving them experience
which could be valuable next year when
some of the NSW stars will be fading.
Whether this will be done is doubtful.
It is not the usual Australian way.
Caution is preferred, unless a large
number of retirements makes it worth
a gamble. Our 1964 Olympics team is a
perfect example of caution, our 1964
cricket team one of the gambles that had
to be taken, cautiously of course and
look how well it is paying off.
The factor which is too often forgotten
is experience’s strong tendency to fail
when those chips are down, because the
body can't stand the pace. There are
aged “iron men” in every sport, but they
are rare. The injuries begin to occur
more easily, and last longer, each year.
Supporters begin to wonder when their
man is going to “strike form”. They
should be wondering how dependable he
will be when he does. And the selectors
in all sports should look forwards, not
backwards with an emotional factor in
favor of experience. Realism is one
of the things which keep the Australian
League game very much alive. Its
selectors are rarely sentimental.
And these thoughts are occasioned by
the forceful play of four North Queens-
land veterans, Paterson, Gil, Tait and
Clifford against Brisbane a couple of
weeks ago, followed by a sad old break-
down in the subsequent Combined
Country - South Queensland match. It
was a much faster game. Paterson and
Clifford could not keep up with it, Tait
went off with an injured leg, Gil suffered
a head gash. The southern team won 44
to 16 before about 10,000 people. But
Gil, Paterson and Clifford made the
Queensland team to play The Rest.
Last year The Rest beat Queensland,
but this did not affect selection very
much. It merely led to Barry Muir’s
optimism, and a massacre when the team
met NSW, This year, Jack Reardon has
named ten young prospects, five of
whom are in the Queensland team, while
three are in The Rest. Their names are
Reynolds, Williamson, Doyle, Whittaker,
Brown, Ferguson, McDonald, and for-
wards Crema, Vievers, Manteit. Almost
a team. I'll be surprised if more than
Brown, Crema and Vievers are selected.
Queensland has the makings of a
team, in Barry Muir, Ken Day and Peter
Gallagher. To make a game of the
match against NSW they only need some
players able to meet the pace and the
force, and keep playing, keep trying. For
the sake of Rugby League, it is important
that Queensland makes a good showing
against a NSW team which will be
stronger than ever, and against a French
team which will be out for blood all the
way, after being overrun by the Kanga-
roos last year.
★ ★ ★
The French Rugby League team’s
approach, by way of three warm-up
matches in the Territory and country
Queensland before coming to Sydney,
is a mile from the Everton Soccer team's
programme, which began in Sydney.
Thanks to Channel 9 television, we were
able to see the holiday team that beat
NSW transformed into a beautiful com-
bination of men who played Soccer as it
deserves to be played, and as it only can
be played between teams which are per-
fectly matched or hopelessly matched.
In this instance, Everton was able to
forget Australia was on the field, and
give a splendid exhibition of Soccer foot-
ball.
What effect this moment of truth will
have on the Soccer men who plan to
build a stadium for 100,000 in Sydney is
beyond the normal capacity for guessing
unless they plan to import a few
teams from England, Europe and South
America, to run a competition which
would fill such a stadium. Matches
between “Australia” and occasional visit-
ing club teams are unlikely to do it, even
when nine of the “Australia” team are
Sydney favorites. You can gather that
I’m a bit with the Melbourne supporter
who said, “Australia! Nine from Sydney
and two from Melbourne!” And none
from Brisbane, not one from South Aus-
tralia.
It is not long since Sydney and Mel-
bourne each fielded an “Australia” team
against visitors. It may be a long time
before Melbourne, Adelaide and Bris-
bane are again willing to support a visit
which leaves them so much out in the
cold, even with a cigarette company’s
guarantee. And that company must be
wondering, wondering.
★ ★ ★ -<1
In Sydney the Rugby League plans to
spent some poker machine proceeds on
a vast new sports centre built over a
rubbish dump at St Peters, but the clubs
which hold the money seem to have
reasonable doubts about the need for
more stadiums. And at Woodville, in
Adelaide, another fine plan went west
last week when the local council offered
to borrow some £90,000 to improve the
St Clair Oval, but the ratepayers turned
down the idea, three to one, in a
referendum.
Meanwhile, if either party would like
a good oval, there’s one going at St
Kilda, whose football club has agreed to
merge with Moorabbin and eventually
call itself St Kilda-Moorabbin. This was
greeted in fair St Kilda with all the
enthusiasm of Brooklyn farewelling the
Dodgers. Injunctions have been taken
out, and the battle is on. The breakaway
group, which does not want to go, has
taken advertisements in the Melbourne
newspapers, and hands out pamphlets
wherever the Saints play.
But with the city pushing hard against
its back, St Kilda is not the district it
used to be, and this probably counts
more with club members than the strong
inducements the Moorabbin Council
offered them to come along the Bay a
bit. Soon, the “To Let” sign is likely to
go up on St Kilda Oval during winter,
and as it holds up to 40,000 people it
should be big enough for the Sydney
Rugby League needs. Of course it would
have to be returned in the summer. The
St Kilda Cricket Club needs it then.

What Becomes of Malta...
...and our £1milliou trade?
From DESMOND O’GRADY in Rome
Some nations struggle for indepen-
dence while others have it thrust
upon them. Malta is in the second
category for it has lost its strategic im-
portance but, if logistics leave it in the
lurch, international politics could give it
a new importance. Its evolution is of
particular interest to Australia for Malta
and Australia have a stake in each
other's future. From the Maltese side
there is the human link through mig-
ration —as for every ten Maltese in the
islands there is one in Australia. From
Australia's viewpoint Malta could play
an important role in a developing trade
pattern. It is a Mediterranean base
which allows access to North African
and Middle Eastern markets for Aus-
tralian products which are otherwise
handicapped by slow, inflexible shipping.
Foodstuffs can be processed in Malta,
with a saving on freight and canning
charges, then deposited in stores to be
immediately available on demand. The
Australian Dairy Board pointed the way
when it established a butter blending
and packing company in Malta last year.
Production in the first two months this
year exceeded last year’s total as the
bulk of the local market has been cap-
tured and exports are being made to
Crete, Cyprus, the Canary Islands, Ben-
ghazi, and Tripoli,
referendum referred to in this
article has solved nothing because
the final figures were inconclusive.
The “ Yes” vote backed by Archbishop
Gonzi was 65,714. But the “No” vote
advocated by Mr. Mintoff reached
nearly 55,000. To complicate matters
36,000 didn’t vote, a course advo-
cated by two smaller parties. So the
decision now rests with the Colonial
Secretary , Mr Duncan Sandy s, on
whether he will go ahead and imple-
ment independence and a new Con-
stitution on such a slender majority.
A further interest lies in the fact that
Malta will soon be represented at inter-
national conferences which will affect
Australia where its vote will have a
weight equal to those of the USA and
the USSR. The prospect should en-
courage Australia to foster close
relations with Malta but at the moment
the question is “which Malta?”
The real contestants for power are
Archbishop Michele Gonzi and Dominico
Mintoff, head of the Maltese Labour
Party. The bitterness may be gauged
from incidents which followed the return
from London of Gonzi who was called
there, as were the leaders of the five Mal-
tese political parties during the last three
months, to discuss with Duncan Sandys
the constitution for the islands prepared
by Borg Oliver’s government and the am-
endments proposed by Mintoff. Monsig-
nor Gonzi had rejected the amendments
in the name of Catholic Malta and the
population was invited to show its grati-
tude. A thick-packed, cheering crowd
so slowed his car on the way from Luqa
airport to Valetta that the trip took
two hours instead of twenty minutes.
The crowd which had waited all that
time in front of the cathedral welcomed
his arrival with waves of applause and
shrieks from the women.
A week later the archbishop said that
the prisons would have to be extended
to the size of half Malta to take all
those who, like him, would refuse to
obey Mintoff's clauses “aimed against
the Church” if they were included in
the constitution.
But then at one of his most enthusias-
tic mass meetings, Mintoff drew a deci-
sive “No!” from the crowd when he
asked “Do you want an archbishop who
interferes continually in politics, do you
want this man as archbishop?” But so
many dramatic examples of mutual pro-
vocation are available that the issues in
question are often lost from view.
Among the more contentious amendments
Mintoff proposed were an adaptation of
the English People’s Representation Act
to provide legal sanctions for anyone
who envokes spiritual or religious penal-
ties against those who vote for a certain
party; the introduction of civil matri-
mony; the equality of religions before
the law; freedom for new denomina-
tions; and prohibition of bell-ringing to
upset public meetings held in church
squares.
The last amendment revealed the Don
Camillo aspect of the problem while
the others, although their advisability
may be discussed, did not seem capable
of generating all the heat they have pro-
duced in Malta. Some of this heat de-
rives from the clash of steel against
steel whenever Gonzi and Mintoff go
into action. The stereotypes contrast
them as a reactionary, narrow-minded
churchman opposed to a radical demo-
crat and Gonzi's 79 years as against
Mintoff's 48 completes the simple image.
Their similarities, however, are more
intriguing than their differences. Gonzi
sponsored the Labour Party which Min-

toff now leads against him so he is more
likely to regard the former Rhodes
Scholar as a usurper than as an outsider.
Mintoff accuses Gonzi of being pro-
British but the Archbishop was such an
opponent of the British in the 1930 s
that he was unofficially banished to the
island of Gozo.
I Mintoff is playing to a wide audience,
mainly English, which cannot see why
IMalta should not have a separation of
Church and State even sharper than that
which exists in England. In Malta
priests are not engaged in solely spiri-
tual tasks but are teachers, social work-
ers and advisors on every kind of subject.
There are no civil registers in the islands
but only parish registers. The Church,
with its village feast days, provides the
only sort of entertainment for 40 per
cent of the people. In such circum-
stances the Church does not have to
enter into politics: it is already there.
Oddly enough although Mintoff was
the first political leader not responsive
to pressure from the bishops, he was the
I first to make grants to the private, that
lis Catholic, schools. In 1958 his plan
for integration with the United Kingdom
fell down at the last minute. He blamed
Archbishop Gonzi for the failure and
only since then has been anti-clerical.
It is understandable that Duncan
Sandys should avoid trying to settle what
he described as ‘‘this rather delicate eccle-
siastical question” for he already has one
very formidable archbishop to deal with
in Cyprus, but the Vatican might have
considered itself more expert. It took
part, unofficially, in one of the two vain
attempts to bring Gonzi and Mintoff to-
gether but now it sees all, says nothing,
and will put its hands to its ears when
the crash comes. Vatican official opin-
ion of Monsignor Gonzi’s diplomatic
skill can be judged from one comment
that he mistakenly believes a straight
line is the shortest distance between two
points.
The politico-religious debate over the
constitution is regrettable not only for
its bitterness but also because it distracts
attention from the question of what
Malta will do once it is independent.
Although independence may not be
granted on May 31 as proposed it will
not be long delayed. The prospects for
this arid rock were the subject of a
recent survey by a United Nations mis-
sion under Professor Wolfgang Stolper
who prepared the six-year developmental
plan adopted by Nigeria. In his as yet
unpublished report Stolper maintains
that the “fortress image” discouraged
trade, traffic and tourism in the past and
that the United Kingdom should honor
bs responsibilities by granting a large
Part of the £52 million sterling for
Malta's second five-year plan which

GRAND MASTER-KEYED SYSTEM
Each lock has its own individual key which operates that lock only and
no other, but the locks are divided into two or more groups. Each group
is subject to its own Master-Key which opens all locks in that group, but
no other group.
However, all locks are also subject to a Grand Master-Key which opens
all locks in all groups.
As with .Master-Keyed Systems, Keyed-Alike groups may also be fhCluded
in G.M.K. Systems.

Australia could play a special role in
Malta’s difficult future. While many
nations will be out to buy Malta’s vote
in international assemblies, Australia’s
relations with the new nation will have
a different basis: the Aussie bars and
Queensland saloons scattered through-
out Malta hint at the special place Aus-
tralia occupies in the people’s affection
whereas they have ambivalent feelings
towards England. Policies are not built
on sentiment but it makes a good cement.
Australia should lose no time in pro-
tecting its £AI million yearly trade
which makes it Malta’s second largest
supplier of foodstuffs. Malta is more
advantageous to Australia as a trading
base for the Middle East and North
Africa than for any other country and,
if it becomes a free port, developments
on the island should be followed with
close interest. And it could pay Aus-
tralia handsome dividends to offer econo-
mists and other trained personnel to help
Malta in its first years of independence.

carefully, more subtly and more justly
conducted.
That Dr Dering had been libelled was
never in question. He had not done as
many '"'experiments” as had been sug-
gested and he had used anaesthetics a
spinal injection. There was, in effect, a
question of damages only. His attempt
to get these was rewarded with a half-
penny and the burden of costs. His self-
justification was self-damning and the
verdict was precisely right. One great,
rare cheer for the British is in order.
In 1948, a hearing was conducted
before the Chief Metropolitan Magis-
trate as part of the British Government’s
exhaustive inquiries into whether Dr
Dering should be handed over to the
Polish Government. A Mr G. who had
been a Jewish prisoner in Auschwitz was
brought over from France to identify the
doctor. This he failed to do.
He was, in fact, one of two Mr Gs.
(Since one is still alive, their names
should be hidden.) They were in a batch
of eight Jews sent for “treatment”. In
the exquisitely neat Auschwitz medical
register, opposite their names and under
the column for treatment, is the word
“castrato”. This Mr G had been “treated”
by Dr Grabczynski who was brought
from Poland to give evidence at this
trial and the other Mr G, on the
very next line, by Dr Dering.
The result of this long trial was never
a foregone conclusion. The Judge was
careful to deflate emotionalism. Indeed,
towards the end, a lawyer might justly
complain that he took too active a part
in cross-examination. The pendulum of
probability swung backwards and for-
wards until the end of his summing up.
But in the end the verdict was the work
of a very stolid-looking, ex-service sort
of jury.
It is possible that they dislike the novel
in question, which happens to be anti-
British in tone. Dr Dering may have
looked to them an underdog being
hounded for things done long ago,
abroad, and in circumstances of which
the British have little experience and
upon which they have a vague reluctance
to pass judgment. And yet, in effect,
they found against him.
It may have been in part the result of
the way Dr Dering gave evidence. He
would insist on referring to his patients
as “Jewesses” in a way that sounded
offensive. He appeared to show a curious
indifference to them, as if what he had
done and done so badly had been
simply a routine job.
In contrast there was the Professor of
Gynaecological Surgery Professor
Nixon. There was one awful moment
when he recited a part of the Hippocratic
Oath. “I will abstain from abusing the
bodies of men and women, either free
or slave”. And the Court, for a moment
of truth, sat in icy silence.
Then there was the ex-patient who
was heard in camera lest he be recog-
nised. He was the only one to speak in
English. He described the doctor as a
man who smiled and laughed in
Auschwitz, and he described his attitude
as “I’m all right, Jack”. They understood
that.
Little that was new emerged in this
trial. Trials arising out of the behavior
of doctors in concentration camps have
been held before. Dr Dering’s superior,
Dr Schumann, a lieutenant in the Luft-
waffe who specialised in experiments on
females, is still alive and free. He is in
Ghana —at least so long as Ghana
refuses an extradition treaty with Western
Germany.
Dr Dering was himself a prisoner. He
was only the tool of such men. What
were they really doing? They were
carrying out one stage in a mass experi-
ment to find an easy way of sterilising
what they might regard as lesser breeds
or enemies, such as Russians, Poles and
half-Jews, that would be a sophisticated
alternative to the immediate extermina-
tion kept for the Jews, who were re-
garded as devilish and inhuman.
The method they sought should be
cheap and quick. It should leave its
subject with his capacity for work un-
impaired but with no possibility of
propagation. So they irradiated male
and female organs and crudely removed
them to see what had happened to them.
Dr Dering performed only the second
stage of a vast experimental process
which has added nothing useful to the
sum of human knowledge—unless you
want to kill off whole races.
The doctor was given a completely
fair trial. The Judge was at pains to
insist that they were talking of Ausch-
witz and not of Barfs. The moral
defence for doing a bad thing lest worse
happen was clearly stated. The cosy
sanity of an English panelled court, the
robes and wigs, the normality of ritual,
the cold urbanity of Lord Gardiner, left
facts to speak for themselves. And the
facts were very terrible. (OFNS)

Theologians and the Pill
Winds of change in Catholic thinking?
From BRUCE COOPER in London
T ast September I wrote an article ex-
pressing the hope that the Vatican
Council at its next session would re-
examine its teaching on birth control.
Never has an article of mine aroused
such interest as this one —not because
it was particularly good, but because it
expressed what so many Catholics were
feeling but until that moment had re-
frained from saying publicly.
From the sidelines I have observed
the issue being taken up in a wide
variety of well-known publications, not
to mention smaller and less well-known
Catholic and non-Catholic publications.
And the pattern is invariably the same:
a massive and urgent demand for re-
examination. These articles have had
one thing in common; they have all been
written by laymen. The core of resis-
tance, when it has come, has come from
the clergy, though many priests have
been conspicuously and commendably
reticent.
One understood in private from talking
to priests that they were unhappy about
the lack of clarification, particularly over
“the pill.” But these doubts are now
being expressed in public and here,
surely, is the most hopeful sign for a
change. The Belgian theologian Janssens
cautiously endorsed oral contraceptive
pill's in a Belgian periodical, “Epheme-
rides Theologicae Lovanienses”. A
Dutch Dominican, Father Willem van
der Marck, has contended that pills do
not constitute a temporary sterilisation,
as Pius XII had claimed, but merely
postpone ovulation, the ova remaining
in the ovaries for future fertilisation.
Haring, another continental theologian,
takes the issue from a slightly different
angle. He accepts that total continence
is most undesirable and argues that the
orientation of married love is towards
bodily love and that the marriage act is
the core of what he calls “the commu-
nity of love.” This is lifting the issue
not to a splitting of hairs, but to a
framework for a new theology of sex,
if one can use the term.
But whilst theologians may admit that
women can use hormones to regulate the
menstrual cycle, or if they are in danger
of rape, or even by nursing mothers to
reinforce the natural sterility that most
women possess during lactation, it is the
bishops who make the decisions in the
Vatican Council. And now the bishops
themselves have even entered into the
arena.
Archbishop Roberts, the English Jesuit
and a former Archbishop of Bombay, in
an article which appeared in a modest
and relatively unknown Catholic sub-
scription magazine called “Search”, de-
serves to be quoted at length. He said,
after admitting that over and above what
human reason could find out there are
the commands of an infallible Church:
“I personally cannot follow what is
called the ethical argument. It does not
seem to me to be conclusive. If I were
not a Catholic I would accept the posi-
tion taken by the Lambeth Conference:
namely, that there are cases where con-
scientious thought by the parties con-
cerned would entitle people to practice
contraception. How you can destroy the
position by reason alone is not clear to
me.”
later he goes on: “Where authority
is concerned, have we absolute cer-
tainty that this matter of contraception
is not liable to the same change as hap-
pened in the case of usury? The attitude
of any modern confessor to lending
money at interest is totally different
from what obtained 400 years ago.
Economists have taught us things about
money that were not then realised. The
same may be true of the laws of ‘nature’.”
As a bishop whose pastoral care was in
the underdeveloped countries, he knows
the choice which the impoverished
laborer is faced with, living in his mud-
hut with his wife and several children,
too poor to be able to afford any light
and forced to be with his wife every
night for twelve hours in the dark and
having nothing else at all but her love.
“The Catholic missionary gives him the
alternatives complete abstention or
the ‘safe period’. The Protestant mis-
sionary suggests that nature did not give
sex organs only for the production of
children, but also, even independently,
for the expression of married love. He
offers contraception, not as an ideal solu-
tion, but as a lesser evil than sterilisation,
than abortion, than the hunger of his
children, than the death of his wife or
the death of their married love.”
Here, surely, is the wind of change
that so many Catholics have been wait-
ing for. In an increasingly overpopula-
ted world the nature of marriage can
change from that of mere procreation
which made sense in early times.

LBJ
The President
in the South
They listen to LBJ
From GODFREY HODGSON
in Washington
President Johnson came back to
Washington from a tour of six
States in 30 hours. It was con-
ceived as a sales tour for his campaign
against poverty. It turned into a home-
coming for the President to the land of
his fathers.
And it may yet prove to have been
a decisive stage in the reconciliation of
the Deep South to the coming of Negro
equality.
In mid-afternoon we landed at Knox-
ville, Tennessee. Now we were in the
South.
There we ran poverty to ground in
Riverside Drive. Ten cars and two
buses poured into the drab curving street
of peeling boarding-houses, and dis-
gorged the President, officials, reporters,
secret service men and the necessary
logistical support.
The President met Mr and Mrs Har-
rison Moore and their very sick and not
very clean-looking baby. Governor Cle-
ments in silk suit and gold watch-chain
was heard saying: “Til see she gets the
best of medical care.”
We climbed shamefacedly back into
buses. At Goldsboro, North Carolina,
400 miles away, we boarded Marine heli-
copters for the flight over the flat pine-
woods to Rocky Mount.
LBJ arrived and the official party,
with attendant media, advanced in
double company strength on the poor.
They are poor all right. Mr and Mrs
Marlow have seven children and a grand-
mother to support, and although he is
a strong, cheerful-looking man of 39,
he has been kept off work with a slipped
disc.
He is a sharecropper on the system
called “the halves”. Most of his total
income of under $l5OO a year (about
£700) is an advance from the landlord
on his half of the year’s crops from nine
acres of tobacco and 11 acres of cotton.
And on this he not only maintains a
tractor and farm buildings: he pays
10 per cent interest.
The President sat on the bed in the
scantily furnished main room of the
Marlows’ unpainted, wooden house and
talked things over with them for 15
nfinutes while numerous Senators, Con-
gressmen and local officials tried to get
photographed with the Marlow boys,
taking an interest in poverty outside.
Mr Johnson was sympathetic: his father
worked a small cotton farm in Texas “on
the halves”. But he emerged looking
chastened.
Then he went out into the square and
gave the crowd of 50,000 what they had
come to hear what the South calls a
real stem-winder. His voicq broke with
certainly genuine emotion when he said:
“Some people never get a decent break
because they are born with the wrong
colour of skin.”
When a man like this comes and talks
about Civil Rights, the Southerners will
take it. From Mr Kennedy, they would
have resented it bitterly. And powerful
Senators and Congressmen who would
have held aloof from Mr Kennedy can-
celled engagements to be on the same
platform with Mr Johnson all through
the trip, (ofns)

A Polish Revolt
Another “Jewish Plot”?
By EUGENE BAJKOWSKI
The dramatic protest of 34 Polish in-
tellectuals against Communist cen-
sorship and administrative stifling
of cultural freedom in Poland must be
viewed against the background of
Premier Gomulka’s complex political
situation.
The long-postponed Fourth Congress
of the ruling Communist Polish United
Workers’ Party (PZPR) is beginning in
June. It will be a crucial test of Gomul-
ka’s personal leadership, challenged by
several warring factions now savagely
fighting for power.
In determined but polite words, the
protest by the 34 intellectuals demanded
an easing of censorship and an end to
administrative harassing of Polish intel-
lectuals. Another major complaint was
over the arbitrary distribution of news-
print, a major weapon in faction fighting
and a means of political control. Pub-
lications which fail to obey PZPR’s
“ideological guidance” simply find their
newsprint quotas suddenly cut down.
Committing a major psychological
blunder, the Communist censors blue-
pencilled the protest out of the Polish
Press. But its text became well known
throughout the country anyway, and its
suppression merely helped it to get front-
page headlines in the West.
Public opinion’s reaction was
swift. Twenty-three English intellectuals
promptly supported their Polish col-
leagues in a letter to the London “Times”.
Harvard professors, Swedish and Swiss
writers and journalists, French intellec-
tuals and the Polish emigre Press all
protested angrily.
Immediate reprisals followed the pro-
test. The radio, Press, television network
and publishing houses were prohibited
from even mentioning the 34 newly pro-
scribed intellectuals. Passports of those
who were about to leave on lecture tours
abroad were impounded by the police.
But attempts to bring back strong-arm
methods misfired. Even the world-wide
campaign in support of the protesting
writers and scholars is less important
than the fierce reaction provoked in
Poland itself.
In Warsaw students and printing
workers held mass meetings. Ominous
rumblings came from the great factories
of Silesia and Poznan, where the 1956
riots were sparked off.
Premier Cyrankiewicz ordered the re-
turn of several impounded passports, can-
celled some other punitive sanctions and
promised to “examine in detail” the
protest.
T>etreating, Gomulka has tried to split
* the intellectuals by appeals to
“reasonableness”. That he has partly
succeeded is shown by yet another letter
in the London “Times”, signed by ten
scholars who had also signed the
original protest, saying that some of the
publicity given to the protest in the West
was “exaggerated”.
At the same time Gomulka’s weekly
“Polityka” accused the intellectuals of
supporting the “lies” in the Western
Press, and placing the whole “domestic”
dispute “out of proportion”. The pro-
Peking “partisans” have called the pro-
test a “Jewish plot”. (A few of the
signatories, including Slonimski, are
Jews.)
But, despite all efforts to “save face”,
Gomulka continues to retreat. He has no
point in antagonising the intellectuals to
the extent of making them sworn enemies
at the Party Congress, at w'hich they will
have their own adherents. The wary
Gomulka also wants to avoid unneces-
sarily provoking the students and
workers, who have rallied to the intellec-
tuals’ support. x
It takes considerable courage to make
a public political protest, even in Gomul-
ka’s Poland where malcontents are not
gaoled but merely lose their passports
and jobs. This right to protest has been
successfully asserted.
But whether the primary aim of the
protest less censorship, greater free-
dom of public debate and more news-
print for the independent-minded will
be achieved will be seen only after the
June Congress is over.


Around Melbourne
MERSEY MILLIONAIRES v. THE KELLY GANG
IyfEMBERS of the Victorian Soccer
Federation, when they sleep well
at night, have a lovely dream. They
see the grand final being fought out
between Soccer teams on the MCG
before a crowd of 120,000. They see
Soccer colors on money-boxes, honey
jars and poodle jackets. They see
Soccer players as our most beloved
TV personalities and pub licensees.
And they dream of the approaching
day when Australian Rules will be
reduced to a quaint but almost for-
gotten pastime, with perhaps the odd
game being played at No. 2 Oval,
Albert Park.
So, just to give us a taste of the
real big-time last week, the Soccer
Federation introduces us to the Ever-
ton Club and the first Test. We were
terribly impressed. After all, they
arrived at a significant time. Geelong
Football Club had just been landed
on the carpet at the cathedral of the
VFL, Harrison House. Legend had
it that Geelong had paid Claremont
Club, in Perth, £4OOO for Denis
Marshall. Although it could be said
that Marshall worked for the Custom
Credit Corporation and, who knows,
perhaps Geelong got him on beautiful
easy terms, 7 per cent, payable over
25 years; but this was an unheard of
sum.
Good heavens, £4OOO wouldn’t
even, buy a message boy with Everton,
especially when you consider they
paid £50,000 for a star like Alex
Scott. Yes, Everton was a lesson to
us all. They toured Melbourne in a
great bus which had a banner down
the side: MERSEY MILLIONAIRES
SAY HELLO TO MELBOURNE.
They were all beautifully turned out:
identical blue-grey suits, identical blue
and white ties, cuffs well turned, cuff-
links.
They were ruled like a regiment of
the Royal Horse Artillery. Quite
clearly they were terrified of news-
papermen. We were told that in
England it was a mortal sin for any
player to talk to a sports writer with-
out permission and, even, the inter-
view often had to be vetted before
it was published.
And even more interesting, there
was little doubt that they come from
a football town even more devoted
than Melbourne. The attendance for
21 Everton home games last season
was 1,037,421, an average of nigh on
50,000, and we learned, too, that
Everton fans had the reputation of
being the roughest, toughest and
worst-behaved in England. It was
quite the thing to wreck a railway
train and pull off the doors. This
made us envious; even Collingwood
fans do not have a reputation like
that.
But as the first Test drew near,
local Soccer officials became pink
with anger. You see, the Australian
Soccer Federation appointed the NSW
South Coast player-coach Jim Kelly
as sole selector for the Australian
team. He was the dictator. He had
carte blanche to go where he liked to
watch Soccer in Australia. He came
to Melbourne for the night Soccer
series and saw at the most two
matches. He missed the significant
Victoria-Tasmania match last month,
when the Victorians were so trium-
phant.
Go this was the result. For the first
Test he named nine New South
Welshmen and only two Victorians.
On top of this the selector was NSW,
the manager was NSW, the referee
was NSW, the captain was NSW;
Victoria just supplied the stewards
and the linesmen. Now, Victoria likes
to think it is equally as strong as
NSW and, justifiably or not, we were
terribly upset. The Australian Soccer
team became known as the Kelly
Gang.
Naturally, your correspondent went
to Olympic Park to witness the first
Test. The place was brimming with
people, a record 32,450, with plenty
more outside the fence.
The first thing we noticed was how,
again, the Everton players were so
beautifully turned out. In Victorian
football the big ruckmen play with
naked arms. Our footballers need
bare arms to boost their ferocity
rating, just like wrestlers wear beards
and long hair. And besides, a bare
elbow can always be better directed
than one that is clothed in pure wool.
In this match the Australian side
tended to let their socks flop around
their ankles. Not so the Everton men.
They were all dressed in pristine white,
and long white Sunday school socks
always were pulled up to perfection.
Another thing we noted was the
respect for the injured. Even with a
good VFL skull fracture there is no
halt in the battle. In this match when
the Everton captain, Roy Vernon, hurt
his ankle all play stopped. It didn’t
start again until the referee was
entirely satisfied that Vernon was still
whole. I mean, in this game you have
to be jolly careful when a capital
asset worth £75,000 falls over.
It was never really a match. Ever -
ton was so contemptuous of the Aus-
tralian forwards that it switched right-
half Jimmy Gabriel as an extra for-
ward, whereupon he kicked three
goals. The pattern of the Everton
attacks, the passing, the ball control,
was beautiful to see. The dribbling
of Alex Scott was almost like a
ballet; he could do a sort of Nureyev
entrechat with the ball.
At half-time, with Everton leading
4-nil, the Kelly Gang was hooted oil
the field. I don’t think the crowd was
showing its objections to the two
Victorians, Jurecki and Adam; the
hoots were sincerely directed at the
NSW side.
Everton relaxed a little in the
second half and Australia scored two
goals, but the final result was still
somewhat convincing 8-2.
Now that Everton has departed we
must get back to realities. I’m afraid
it will take at least several centuries
for Soccer to overtake the national
game. At Olympic Park the average
attendance is around 7000 or, if there
is a fine sunny day and a good match
between George Cross and Hellas, it
could go up to 15,000. In 1960 the
total attendance at Olympic Park was
153,416. For the same matches in
1963 it was 281,000, and there were
four additional matches that drew
another 57,000.

If You

The basic questions... and the answers
When Can You Be Arrested?
policeman may arrest you:
(a) on a warrant. This is an official
order signed by a magistrate. The
warrant states the charge against
you and normally must be read or
showm to you at the time of arrest.
Sometimes a policeman may arrest
a person against whom a warrant
has been issued without having the
warrant in his possession (but, in
such a case, the person arrested has
a right to see the warrant without
unreasonable delay);
(b) without a warrant in certain cir-
cumstances. A policeman’s power
of arrest without a warrant is limit-
ed to the following circumstances:
(1) if you are found by the police-
man in the act of committing
or immediately after having
committed an offence; or
(2) if the policeman suspects with
reasonable cause that you have
committed an offence; or
(3) if you are found by the police-
man loitering during the night
and he suspects with reason-
able cause that you are about
to commit a felony (felony is
a serious offence punishable by
penal servitude).
Any other arrest is unlawful, and the
person arrested may bring an action for
wrongful arrest and false imprisonment.
Can the Police Use Force to Arrest You?
An arrest is made when a person is
seized or his body is touched with
a view ? to his detention. If you are
arrested, you have a right to be inform-
ed immediately of the charge. How-
ever, if you run aw'ay or resist lawful
arrest or bring about a situation in
W'hich it is not possible for the police-
man to inform you of the reason for
arrest, you cannot later complain that
you w ? ere not given this information at
the time of arrest.
If you resist a lawful arrest, the
policeman can use all necessary force to
arrest you. Handcuffing is justifiable
only when there is reasonable necessity
for it.
Do not resist a policeman. Assert
your rights firmly but carefully, other-
wise you may be laying yourself open
to another charge. Above all, answer
no questions except in the circumstances
referred to below.
Do You Have to Answer Questions?
TPhe citizen will naturally wish to give
the police his co-operation in their
task of preventing and detecting crime.
How'ever, he should resist any attempt
to trade upon that co-operation by un-
warranted or officious enquiries or re-
quests of an intimidating character.
A policeman has the right to ask
questions, and in the case of a motor
traffic accident or offence you must give

phlet written by the legal panel of

ney. The pamphlet is printed in a
size that will fit into an ordinary
wallet.
him your name and address. It is an
offence to give a false name and address.
Apart from this, you are not obliged
under any circumstances to answer ques-
tions or to make a statement. This
applies whether the police enquiries are
part of a routine check-up, whether they
arise in the course of a police visit to
your home ask questions, or whether
they are made after you have been
arrested. It is quite possible, unwittingly
and incorrectly, to incriminate yourself
or your friends by hasty or careless
words spoken in the heat of the moment,
which are later given a meaning you
never intended.
As a rule, if you consider yourself to
have been wrongfully arrested or to be
wrongfully under suspicion, you should
say as little as possible until your
solicitor or an independent third party
is present to give you advice. It is only
in limited circumstances that an inno-
cent person under suspicion can derive
substantial benefit from supplying infor-
mation to police in the absence of a
legal adviser. For example, a dealer
who is found in possession of stolen pro-
perty, but who did not know that the
goods had been stolen, should immedi-
ately explain to the police how he ob-
tained the goods lawfully.
Arrest cannot be justified merely for
the purpose of asking questions. More-
over, if you are not under arrest, you
are not obliged to go with a policeman
to a police station for questioning. If
asked or told to do so, you are entitled
to reply: “Are you arresting me? If
not, I'm not coming.” Nor is a police-
man entitled to enter your home to
question you or to search, unless you
invite him to do so or he has a warrant.
If questioned by a policeman, it is
advisable to give him your name and
address. If he asks further questions,
you may then ask whether you are under
arrest. If the answer is “No”, you are
entitled to walk away. It is generally
advisable, however, not to use this right
except in the presence of an indepen-
dent witness who can testify later, if
necessary, to the circumstances.
What Happens After You Are Arrested?
You are taken to a police station,
A where the charge against you must
be formally made and recorded without
unnecessary delay. You may be ques-
tioned in the station, in w'hich case you
should bear in mind the remarks made
above. Any suggestion from a police-
man that by making a statement you will
make things easier for yourself should
be regarded with suspicion.
When you are charged, you may be
searched, have your photograph, finger-
prints, and palm prints taken, and in
some cases you may be examined by a
doctor. Any money or property taken
from you should be recorded by the
police.
Can You be Released on Bail?
Tf you are arrested, you are entitled to
ask for bail. This may be wfith or
without surety. It does not necessarily
mean that cash must be provided, as
you may have assets or a person pre-
pared to go surety may have assets
which will be regarded as sufficient
without the production of cash.
If bail is refused by the police, or if
you cannot produce the stipulated
amount yourself, you should ask for a
friend, relative or solicitor to be notified.
If this request is refused by the police,
ask for the refusal to be recorded, and
raise the matter with a magistrate wfien
brought before him.


EDUCATION BROADCASTING
RADIO AND TELEVISION
003
The AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION is planning an exten-
sion of its education broadcasting services, largely in television.
It is looking for thoughtful, interested teachers who believe that broad-
casting can make a significant contribution to Australian education.
HERE ARE POSITIONS TO BE FILLED: SALARY RANGES
srainees holding an Honours Degree are paid an additional £55 p.a.

Air") which are for Sydney and Melbourne only. When submitting applications, it should
be clearly stated which positions are being sought and the Cities selected, both stated in
order of preference.
DUTIES: Successful applicants will be expected to help to prepare courses of
educational broadcasts and design and produce programmes, working in both
radio and television.
QUALIFICATIONS: Teacher training and experience desirable: general tertiary
background in some of the following fields —drama, literature, music and science:
University degree desirable or intention to complete University studies in the
case of Specialist Trainees.
CONDITIONS: Appointment to permanent staff subject to medical examination

APPt ICATIONS: To Director, Administrative Services, A.8.C., Box 487, G.P.0.,
Sydney, with envelope endorsed “Application Confidential," giving personal data,
education and relevant experience, phone number, with copies only of references.
BY WEDNESDAY, 27ft: MAY.
Collecting Evidence
soon as practicable you should
make a note of conversations with
the police, using as nearly as possible
the exact words spoken.
Contact any possible witnesses imme-
diately, tell them that you have been
charged, and ask them to remember any
relevant facts; but do not suggest to
them what evidence you would like them
to give.
If you have been ill-treated and
injured,
(1) go straight to a doctor and ask
him for a report on your injuries;
(2) have any visible injuries photo-
graphed by a competent photogra-
pher;
(3) contact any persons who saw you
not long before you were arrested,
and ask them to look at your injuries
and state whether they observed
them before you were taken in
custody.
Should You Have a Lawyer with You?
"CVeryone has a right to obtain legal
assistance before being called upon
to answer a charge. If you have any
doubts about your position, you should
ask the magistrate for a remand (ad-
journment) to give you time to consult
a solicitor. Such a request should never
be refused.
There is a tendency for any person
accused of an offence which he has not
committed to think that he has no need
for a lawyer, and that his innocence
will protect him. This is a mistake and
overlooks the fact that evidence against
an accused person may be false as well
as true.
How Should You Plead?
YI/hen brought before a court, you are
entitled to plead NOT GUILTY.
The prosecution is then required to
prove its case. As a general rule, you
should never plead guilty, unless so ad-
vised by a solicitor. This holds good
even if you yourself think you are
guilty—the law is highly technical and
you may be entitled to an acquittal with-
out knowing it.
Do not plead guilty on police advice.
An accused person is sometimes told
by the police that if he pleads guilty,
or makes a confession, they will “play
down” the case and he will get off with
a lighter sentence. Such promises are
not binding and should be treated with
the utmost suspicion.
What if You Cannot Afford
Legal Advice?
/Obtaining justice in court is not cheap.
In terms of money it is usually
cheaper not to engage a lawyer for a
minor charge and to plead guilty. But
the long-term cost of this is a stain upon
your character which can never be
erased.
If you cannot afford to pay for a
lawyer, there may be other ways of
obtaining legal advice. Trade unions
and other organisations often give assis-
tance. In cases of serious offences, free
legal aid may be given by the Public
Solicitor (however, this is not made
available for cases heard before Courts
of Petty Sessions, which deal with most
minor offences).
In cases involving infringements of
civil liberties, the COUNCIL FOR
CIVIL LIBERTIES may be able to help
(2 Phoebe Street, Balmain, NSW, phone
82 3602).

Have a Right to

THEATRE
Inside Tennessee Williams
A lonely man protests against violence
By KEVON KEMP
The Night of the Iguana. Tennessee
Williams. Independent Theatre.
Sydney.
Stop the World, I Want to Get Off.
Anthony Newley, Leslie Bricusse.
Theatre Royal. Sydney.
"VTot so long ago as one might think, to
be an admirer of Tennessee Wil-
liams was to be someone capable of
making a positive act of faith. In what
might be called the “Elia Kazan” period
of Williams, when his plays were pro-
duced with gripping theatricality at the
expense of the playwright's truth, it was
a demanding job to keep one’s temper
and to say, patiently, again and again,
that Williams was not a monster painting
other monsters but a dark poet filled
with pity, a lonely man making his pro-
test against violence, making his pro-
testation for tenderness.
A few weeks ago Williams was fifty
years of age, and it seems that at last
he is being carried by history and time
not to success for he has had great
commercial success but to his proper
due.
Sydney has seen three of his more
recent plays over the past year or two,
all produced by the Independent: “A
Period of Adjustment’’, “Sweet Bird of
Youth”, and now “The Night of the
Iguana”. None of these productions has
been more than partly successful, and it
is a major regret for the city that they
have not been done by a professional
company.
It is a regret because Williams is now
in full voice, and in the comedy “A
Period of Adjustment'’, and the tragi-
comedy of “The Night of the Iguana”,
he is displaying a mastery of his means
beyond the powers of any other play-
w r right at present writing. Some of the
earlier plays, as well as “Sweet Bird of
Youth”, showed Mr Williams’s own par-
ticular hairy heel an inability to con-
trol his material with that lion-tamer
ferocity which the dangers of his themes
demand.
Williams has made personal violence,
the aberrations of power and the decay
of personality important amongst his
targets and all these carry the sweetly
treacherous temptation to dally with
them for their own sakes, for the frisson
of looking on death and dangers. The
writer, as Williams himself would say,
must deal with risky components “ele-
gantly”; he must write so well, so surely,
that no imbalance arises between his
intention and his effecting of it.
One time, a fierce director like Kazan
could take a Williams play and change
it from a passionate and lyrical plea for
tenderness, compassion, communication,
into an intense and knotting display of
animal outrage. I don't think this is
possible any more, and I think it is the
writer himself who has made it impos-
sible.
Williams, on the evidence of “The
Night of the Iguana”, has purified his
work to a degree which now defies
misinterpretation; he no longer dallies
with horrors just that fraction too long;
he does not dwell on his “bad” images
so that they evoke unwanted lusts. He
is writing now in an unmistakable fashion
he treats of devils but is on the side
of the angels. Plainly, unquestionably, on
the side of the angels.
the quality of the writing alone,
A “Night of the Iguana” has to be seen,
but Doris Fitton’s production falls far
short of realising the play’s quality.
There are some remarkable characters
in this story, rich people of the world's
more lonely areas, and it takes rich
acting to fill these characters out. The
required skill, the needed resources of
life experience simply were not there in
the Independent's cast, and this lack,
assisted by Miss Fitton’s (undoubtedly
admiring and well-intentioned) direction
which seemed to have no subtleties be-
yond black and white, made the evening
a heavy disappointment.
But if you wish to see how a sex-
driven widow, a clergyman unfrocked
for seducing teenage girls, an old poet
of ninety-seven, living only until he
finishes his last poem, his middle-aged
granddaughter who supports him and
herself by doing while-you-wait sketches
of tourists, a bunch of touring Baptist
ladies and some expatriate Nazis can
become a compelling microcosm of this
whole world; and if you would like to
leave a theatre feeling that you have
maybe added a cubit or so to your sta-
ture then this is a play you should
be found at. Mr Williams’s lesson in
elegance, tenderness, and the joy of
taking people as they are has been very
finely mounted indeed by eminent de-
signer Desmonde Downing.
“Stop the World, I Want to Get Off”
is a dandy of an idea for a musical, but
it was the idea of Mr Anthony Newley
(a talent whose way-out, beat abilities
would be hard to double) for himself
and without -Mr Newley the show
does not seem able to rise off the pad
at all. In luckier capitals of the world,
a player doubtless could be found to give
at least a reasonable color to the New-
ley role, but the imported star of the
Australian touring show, Mr Jackie
Warner, is not that player. Nor, although
she makes rather more of a fist at it than
Mr Warner, is Miss Evelyn Page
quite up to her task as the female lead.
Full of brilliant movement and choreo-
graphy, the show puts a great load on
the small chorus of circus girls and
the local chorus is pretty stunning, one
must admit. So stunning that whenever
Miss Page appears with them she has
rather a sad air of being a chorus girl
who didn't quite make it. The star
ought more than hold her own against
the company dancers, especially when
the show is so much a dancing display,
and this Miss Page cannot do. Her
singing, however, is quite a joy which
cannot be said for Mr Warner, whom
I found difficult to hear from only seven
rows out.
I personally felt that some blame for
the show's very clear lack of communi-
cation to its audience could be laid at
the producer’s door. There are differ-
ences between what “goes” in London
and what in Sydney, and with all respect
to the obvious very great talents of Eng-
lish dance and mime expert John
Broome, the entire idiom of this produc-
tion was alien to this wide-open town.
With all this said, however, there is
so much that is fresh and exciting in the
approach this musical makes to its art-
form that all theatricals ought to see it.
In the notion of “Littlechap”, the Chap-
lin-like hero of the show, Mr Newley has
a figure that enables many sharp and
cynical thrusts at the myths of our tirne
and many of these you'll enjoy.
TELEVISION
Slapstick
Barley Charlie. Channel 9. Sydney.
Tn “Barley Charlie”, GTV-9, Melbourne,
could have a winner, but who can tell?
Who can hear it above the sound of
galahs? Now and then a line of dialogue
slips through while the studio audience is


catching its breath, and some of these
snippets sound as though they could be
part of some good repartee. Then the
galahs start up again.
Studio audiences are willing to die
laughing every time a comic puts his
foot in a bucket, gets sloshed with some
kind of. goo, takes a prat fall, or loses
his trousers. These acts of broad comedy
are hard to resist when they occur in
front of you, as at the circus. They are
much less on film, as anyone who has
watched the clowns on “International
Showtime” will testify.
This fact is lost on the producer of
“Barley Charlie” and for that matter,
most Australian television comedy. Im-
mediate audience reaction is fine for live
shows. It’s murder to series such as
“Barley Charlie”, designed to blend
sight gags with clever dialogue, each
complementing the other. At least, that
seems to me the writer’s intention. But
who knows, when the audience reaction
to sight gags is loud, and prolonged, and
nothing else is heard.
The script writer, Alan Hopgood,
deserves better. Left to struggle with an
idea throw'n together by Chesney and
Wolfe (“The Rag Trade”) on a paid holi-
day to Melbourne, he has “adapted” their
synopses as well as anyone could. Around
the bones of a situation two sisters
inherit the wreck of country garage, and
its useless mechanic—Hongood has built
a situation comedy series, with some
good episodes, and some bad ones for
various reasons.
One reason is the necessity which
compels the producer to use actors who
are in no way comedians, and who fit in
to the situation like sore thumbs. In a
recent episode Wyn Roberts and Peter
Aanensen turned up as supposed boy
friends of the two sisters (Robina Beard
and Sheila Bradley), leading to some
rare confusion with towel-clad locals in
the bathroom. Roberts and Aanensen
weighed the whole thing down with some
acting straight from “Consider Your
Verdict”, and of course every time the
camera showed a man in a towel and
shower cap the studio audience blotted
out every other sound for a minute or
so.
On such episodes, and worse, “Barley
Charlie” has gained a poor reputation
among the critics. But, allowing for the
fact that one man’s humor is another’s
poison, it can be a very funny show.
The best of the series so far had the
sisters and Charlie (Edward Hepple)
trying to convince an Automobile As-
sociation inspector that their “service”
station was an ideal place for repairs,
and even for an overnight stay.
This time the slapstick was moderated,
the lines were delivered with casual
(expertise, and the whole affair was a
pleasant romp. Hopgood has managed to
shed some of “The Rag Trade”, and
“Steptoe”, flavor which the show began
with, and it is becoming unashamedly
Australian and “outback”, without being
Dad and Dave. If you could spare two
half hours for “Barley Charlie”, chances
are that one of them could be well
spent.

ART
Tormented
Judges
David Boyd. The Johnstone Gallery,
Brisbane.
TAavid Boyd’s series, “The Trial”, fulfils
the postulates of the Antipodean
Manifesto. Not only is the content almost
verbally specific but it is presented in
easily associated symbolic abstractions.
In the large oils huge death-like masks
with wigs represent judges, the physical
body being represented by highly sim-
plified steel-grey forms not unlike primi-
tive stone sculpture or recent Mexican
painting. Mr Boyd often used this style
in “The Explorer” series.
However, this individual approach is
abandoned in the lesser oils and
gouaches in which the stylistic influence
of other painters becomes paramount.
Charles Blackman even more than Boyd’s
brother, Arthur, is the main source of
inspiration. “The Nosegay”, for example,
copies Blackman's repertoire rather than
constructively reworking it. A judge
looms out of the background, his in-
scrutable face emerging as it were from
mist and even the bunch of flowers he
holds is emphasised in typical Blackman
style by indirect lighting. The palette and
method of applying paint are also Black-
man’s. Other works contain simplified
forms bent into positions reminiscent of
Blackman’s children at play.
Boyd, like his brother, has also seized
upon a few of Breughel’s famous figures.
One judge is up a ship’s mast like the
figure in “A Ship of Fools”, another is
perched in a tree, a third is equipped
with a vulture’s beak while most have
Breughel's beady, rat-like eyes.
The format of other secondary paint-
ings also show this tendency to copy.
Many are essentially landscapes engulf-
ing their victims. Some, like “The Escap-
ing Judge III”, indicate visits to the
Tate Gallery’s late Turners; others,
Nolan's type of dry hard desert. All these
various inspirations are blatantly deriva-
tive and although they strengthen Boyd’s
message, it seems a pity that his imagina-
tion is not as fertile as his mind is assimi-
lative.
Nevertheless the message of the series
is Boyd’s own and as in his previous
work is the convincing and powerful
element in his art. Basically Boyd paints
on a theme which is broad enough to
encompass a side gambit of human re-
sponses— firstly, the omnipresent racial
problem couched in terms of Truganini
and now the equally basic problem of
injustice legally perpetrated. His interest
in these subjects stems from a deep
religious concern about the prevalent
disregard of the Ten Commandments. To
Boyd the subsequent mental anguish is
of more interest than is physical torture.
Thus truculent judges avoid prison but
suffer hallucinations in a mental pur-
gatory. However, 86 paintings all stating
the same theme seems verbose especially
as many are below standard either tech-
nically or aesthetically. Even if one re-
spects Boyd's sincerity, one feels that
his view is unduly jaundiced. Also, while
not doubting the authenticity of the urge
behind his paintings, one hopes that his
style and technique become more cogent
and subtle as he matures (he began
serious painting in 1957), and that his
symbolic language will become less
adulterated.

Who, for instance, would deny the force-

as deeply as the finest contemporary

prows, masks, clubs, bowls, totems,

not the least of which is the element of
mystery. The extreme delicacy of craft
belies the term “primitive” in as much
as our lack of understanding coined it.
No intellectual subtlety could unravel

Bach, Rameau, Daquin, Couperin).

Edition No. 6118.
Tt is hackneyed to say that one of the
most important developments in
musical performance in this century has
been the rediscovery of the music of
earlier centuries, the instruments on
which it was played and the manner in
which it should be performed (in-
evitably, the Germans have devised a
five-syllable word for this last study —-
A uffuhrungspraxis).
But it often seems that we make pro-
gress very slowly. Twenty-five years ago
recordings of Bach and his contempor-
aries which used a harpsichord rather
than a piano were a rarity; today, a
recording of baroque chamber music, at
least, which used a piano would be un-
thinkable. The elaborate Bach “editions”
of former days are in disrepute even
among piano teachers, and the Urtext is
the thing. But although it will soon be
50 years since the principles of baroque
performance practice were clearly set
out by Arnold Dolmetsch, the profession-
al performers who go beyond the pure
written notes and supply the improvised
embellishments and refinements which
the audience of Bach’s and Purcell’s days
expected are still far between.
The professional player is, in fact, the
stumbling block. There are so few that
are ready or able to unlearn the habits
ground in by years of hard training.
Until this inertia is overcome it is fairly
fruitless for critics to complain too con-
stantly about the sort of player who at
least gives us the written notes on rough-
ly the right sort of instrument; the best
we can do is to reserve special praise for
those rare professionals who really try
to discover and reproduce the baroque
styles (for there was not one but many,
differing according to period and
nation).
By current standards Rampal and Vey-
ron-Lacroix get fairly good marks for
their interpretation of the Bach sonatas
for flute an obbligato harpsichord (the
flute-and-continuo sonatas will occupy
the second volume of this Record Society
venture, taken from the French Erato
catalogue and here issued in Australia
for the first time).
In one sense they make things easy
for themselves just by playing Bach. For
in respect of performance practice, as in
so many others, Bach is the great excep-
tion. It is well known that he was in the
habit of writing out in full the embellish-
ments that other composers left to the
performer, and the subtle rhythmic in-
flections which so enliven the music of
Handel or Couperin often seem to fit
awkwardly into Bach. So Rampal does
well enough by preserving a light crisp
style (supported by an excellent tech-
nique), and sticking to the written notes.
But even Bach, I am sure, would have
thought it was a dull fellow who failed to
ornament the simple arpeggio at the
opening of the Largo of Sonata I when
it came up for repetition.
The 18th century loved the flute, be-
cause it was so gracious and galant. But
it was altogether typical of Bach that he
should have put the elegant flute to work
on one of his most severe, serious and
wide-ranging chamber works, the Sonata
in B minor, Rampal’s rather reedy French
tone provides the incisive attack the
work needs in its more austere passages,
but in a movement as long as the open-
ing Andante it tends to monotony of
color.
If, in this sonata, Bach characteristic-
ally allowed musical thought processes to
outrun instrumental resources he relented
in the second sonata (in E flat) and wrote
a beautifully tender, good-humored and
graceful work that is ideally suited to the
flute. The third sonata, in A, adds to
these qualities a greater warmth and rich-
ness. The fourth sonata on this disc,
rather separate from and inferior to
the others, is the disputed G minor
work (BWV 1020) which may or may
not have been intended for flute.
Rosalyn Tureck's record of harpsichord
music illustrates very well the point made
earlier about Bach's self-sufficiency in re-
lation to period practice. The major work,
and the one that really makes the record
worth while, is the great Chromatic
Fantasia and Fugue of Bach, which Miss
Tureck drives along with enough imagi-
nation and musicianship to make an ex-
citingly convincing performance.
On the other side of the disc, how-
ever, we have a group of works from the
French clavecinistes, who require above
all a scholarly and sensitive understand-
ing of period style in which Miss Tureck,
for all her reputation, is not notably in
advance of other pianist-cum-harp-
sichordists. Rameau’s Aria and Variations
is a dullish piece, rather dully played,
and more, I think, could be made of
Couperin's “L’Atendrissante". The other
pieces are light and lively miniatures
which require little than the dexterity
which Miss Tureck certainly possesses.

Australian exploration has been an
~ unpopular field for Australian his-
torians. Even the explorers’ narratives
have lain dusty in research libraries for
many a year. And when their thick
double octavos do come into the ken of
those outside the ordinary circle of
original research workers they usually
go to the shelves of collectors and
speculators.
Yet their lives and adventures are a
treasure-house waiting for the novelist
and the biographer. What better subject
for the writer of romance could there
be than that of Edward John Eyre, a
settler in 1833, who became an over-
lander, an explorer and a Governor of
more than one colony, his career culmin-
ating dramatically in Jamaica. He was
a man who knew as much as any of
the inside of the continent when its
population, free and freed, was only
37,000, and when Governor Bourlce
ruled. He died just as the first Common-
wealth Parliament was adjourning for its
first Christmas recess in 1901 —a man
who had made the great pioneer trek
with a single native companion along
the fringes of the Great Australian
Bight, who had turned back from the
interior because he thought Lake Torrens
an impassable barrier to further progress
northward, who had suppressed rebellion
in Jamaica with firm ruthlessness and
had hanged the rebels; and whose life as
an alleged murderer had been fought for
desperately by two tug-of-war teams of
which the improbable opposing person-
nels were: J. S. Mill, Huxley, Tom
Hughes, Herbert Spencer and Goldwin
Smith, implacably for hanging him; and
Charles Kingsley, Carlyle, Ruskin and
Tennyson, his triumphant champions, and
Disraeli his patron.
George Grey was no less arresting as
a literary subject and more as an ex-
plorer than the others for his observation
and for the catholicity of his interests.
He lived to be the grand old father of
New Zealand democracy and of its
political modernity, one who in the
Dominion ranks where William Charles
Wentworth ranks in Australia. Yet,
though he is better documented than the
rest and had a greater world stature, his
is a life as much neglected in the
literary field as that of Leichhardt has
been patronised. But the old Pitta Pitta
greeting Mierli pa mooloo etcli’li "the
good man never dies” has certainly not
been true about Australian explorers. As
with Ned Kelly, it is the bad ones and
the bunglers, the Burkes and the Leich-
hardts, that have become famous in Aus-
tralian story; the good ones have been
interred in the haze of the past.
npHE first three authors of the seven
volumes now issued in Adelaide
operated before the days of available
tinned meat supplies and camels (which
came in for exploring with Burke and
Wills). What they saw was fresh, vivid
and novel to them. Grey and his party
not only reported on the nature of the
country they travelled along the western
fringes of Westralia, but they brought
back the pioneer scientific records of
Westralian mammalia, birdlife, amphibia
and insects of their explored country.
Grey, too, was a recorder of those
strange and forgotten people the pristine
overlanders, ragged men who burst into
fringe areas of settlement with the sur-
vivors of mobs of adventurously droved
cattle and sheep, to be hailed as public
benefactors and to become rich pastoral
barons as the reward of their daring and
enterprise. And he wrote some of the
most discerning essays on Aboriginal life
and lore and, particularly, on Aboriginal
tongues.
He had more imagination than Eyre,
his successor, who, however, began his
great explorations with eight years of
experience of Australian interior con-
ditions behind him, whereas Grey had
come out in 1837 as a “clean skin” from
the Royal Geographical Society with the
blessing of the British Government. Eyre
had been an overlander, a settler, a
drover, an experimental penetrator of
bush and desert. He had travelled from
Adelaide up around the unpromising en-
virons of Port Lincoln in the years 1836-
40 before he went on the two astonishing
journeys into Central South Australia
and from Adelaide round the Great Aus-
tralian Bight to King George’s Sound.
There is a curious parallel between his
turning back from Mt Hopeless under
the impression that Lake Torrens formed
an insuperable barrier which would pre-
vent further progress northwards, and
Oxley’s similar conclusions about the
Macquarie River marshes.
Giles was of a different school from
the earlier explorers. He belonged to the
age of John Forrest. He belonged to the
age of the OT Line, when Stanley and
Livingstone had made exploration of the
outskirts of Empire a fashionable vogue.
He had come out of the age of the tower
musket into the age of the Snider
which was much more dangerous than
any wild warrigal, as anybody who has
ever fired one knows. He had the
camel where the others of the Mitchell-
Sturt-Grey-Eyre vintage had made-do
with horses, Shanks’ or otherwise.
But neither the drama of his illustra-
tions by Val Prinsep, the domestic detail,
nor the little snippets of popular verse
with which he interlards his narrative
detract from the seriousness and im-
mensity of the work he and his com-
panions did in their expeditions. The
first began in the arid four-inch rainfall
country at Chamber’s Pillar, north of
the Finke, crossed the Krichauffer Range
and followed the mountains westerly out
to the Ehrehberg, broke south in criss-
cross explorations to the north shore of
Lake Amadeus and returned along the
southern side of Gill’s Range and the
Palmer River. The second journey was
an amazing in-and-out wandering and
general exploration mostly of the country
south of Lake Amadeus to a point west
of 126 E. longitude. The third took him
north of the South Australian lakes and
westward down to the Great Australian
Bight, and these were pipe-openers to his
grand journey from Beltana to Perth
across and into and round about the
Victoria Desert and back again via
Geraldton, Gibson’s Desert just below
the Tropic of Capricorn and south of
Amadeus. He was one of the first men
to see and describe Ayer’s Rock.
The South Australian Public Library
does a great service in making the texts
of these volumes available to both
general students and readers with draw-
ings and maps (colored as in the
originals) for prices that are moderate
beside the £l5O which one would expect
to have to lay out in buying originals—
if and when originals become available,
as they rarely do. It is to be hoped that
the Library will complete its coverage of
basic exploration with editions of
Mitchell’s and Oxley’s narratives.

Knocking
Doctors
Fringe Medicine. Brian Inglis. Faber &
Faber. 495. 9d.
HPhis is a pot-boiler, but the theme is
a good one. Brian Inglis is an Anglo-
Irish journalist-historian who is dissatis-
fied with orthodox medicine. At any rate
he has made it his business to find out
about naturopathy, herbalism, homeo-
pathy, osteopathy, chiropractics, acu-
puncture, yoga, lay psychotherapy,
hypnotherapy, auto-suggestion, Christian
Science, spiritual healing and radiesthe-
sia, and he gives a sympathetic account
of them all in this book. He thinks they
should be officially recognised.
Knocking the doctors is a popular
sport, the anti-clericalism of our time,
and Mr Inglis makes quite a good
though uneven case for the achievements
of the quacks. He dismisses orthodox
medicine as being hopelessly preoccu-
pied with drug treatment, much of it
ineffective. There is truth in this, but he
is mistaken when he suggests that the
doctors themselves are blind to it. For
instance, he states that articles question-
ing the allopathic basis of orthodox
medicine are almost as unusual in medi-
cal journals as objections to the doctrine
of papal infallibility in “L'Osservatore
Romano”. The inference is untrue, and
the simile is the kind one would expect
from a likeable, dotty Anglo-Irishman.
It is not true that orthodox medicine
is an immutable monolith. It may be
solid, and may not change with the wind,
as in some ways Mr Inglis would like
it to do, but its system of self-criticism
with open publication and discussion of
results is at least as internally corrective
over a period as case law. There is
recurrent confrontation with facts, but,
again like law, medicine is a bit of an
ass. It still contains as much irrational
and intuitive principle and practice as
any aesthete or literary humanist or
member of the BRF or believer in the
life force could wish, and to add a whole
lot more, as Mr Inglis requires, would
be to endanger a useful institution, and
such are hard to come by. He scarcely
touches the fundamental discussion
which any serious book of this kind
should acknowledge at length; that is,
what institutional arrangements ought
ideally to be made (assuming that
orthodox medicine is as imperfect as he
says) to control the application of human
biological knowledge in our society. Mr
Inglis seems to know that the overriding
problem is how to reconcile sufficient
stability with sufficient capacity for
change, but he has no feeling for ap-
propriate time scales or rates. He would
run the world as though it began and
was to end in his own life span.
A medical orthodoxy is wise to be
conservative, and the educated public
should require it to be so. In the present
age, orthodox medicine has deliberately
chosen to accept only those innovations
which can be related to discoveries in
the fundamental biological sciences (not
excluding those which deal with the be-
havior of whole vertebrates), believing
that this is what will pay off for human-
ity. This is frankly materialistic and may
for the present be ignoring a medicine
of the spirit, which, incidentally, is much
cheaper as Mr Inglis points out, but
he seems never to have heard of
the tens of thousands of patients in hos-
pitals and general practices who are
cured by proper doctors who simply pre-
scribe and administer TLC, one way or
another, just like the best quacks.
Generally, one can recommend the
book to those qualified medical workers
and auxiliaries who may be wondering
what their unqualified brethren are up
to. (The answer is, not much, really,
and that pretty soft and harmless.) Those
who have a grudge against the doctors
should hurry to read it, too, for they
will find much loose argument to sup-
port their convictions, which is always
pleasant. (TLC? tender loving care.
BRF? British royal family. Pas
devout, you know.)

Twilight World
The Whitsun Weddings. Philip Larkin.
Faber. 20s. 9d.
Seventy-Three Poems. E. E. Cum-
mings. Faber. 295. 9d.
Tt has been Philip Larkin’s policy to
publish a book of poems every nine
or ten years, and “The Whitsun Wed-
dings” his third book will cer-
tainly consolidate his growing reputation.
Since “The Less Deceived” in 1955, Lar-
kin has become widely known —especi-
ally by literary journalists more interest-
ed in “movements” than in individual
poems as the head of the post-Dylan
Thomas “Movement”. He is seen as
representing certain attitudes typical of
the Welfare State. Larkin’s general tone
is anti-rhetorical, a little off-hand. His
mood is sad and grey, not tragic or
bleak. But if his general attitude is one
of a wry acceptance of the inevitable
drabness of things, it goes without the
little self-congratulatory asides and
shruggings that such an attitude usually
implies. Larkin is never cynical and
consequently never self-pitying. The
strength of his poetry comes from its
odd mixture of the formal and the col-
loquial. Its language of detachment does
not indicate a failure to respond, though
some of the poems are full of the reali-
sation of lost chances. The book asserts
a sense of frail human dignity. Its great
theme is possibilities and limitations.
Larkin’s output.is small: thirty poems
in ten years, all of them extremely short;
and it would be uncomfortably easy to
“place" him as a “minor” poet. His
range, however, is notably varied both
in subject matter and approach; it can
move from the nimble solemnity of “The
Whitsun Weddings” (the gradual becom-
ing aware of wedding parties seen from
a seat in a train); the precise observa-
tion of “Ambulances”; the paradoxical
vulgarity of “Sunny Prestatyn”; the sly
good humor of “Naturally the founda-
tion will bear your expenses”, to the
timeless simplicity of “An Arundel
Tomb”.
Larkin’s achievement rests on a sustain-
ed certainty of tone. And whether his car-
rying-image is a truss-advertisement, lis-
tening to a concert broadcast, or a sick
person being carried from house to ambu-
lance, his poems unfold with an
unhurried precision, an unemphatic
pace and tone that can cope with the
colloquial, the subdued, the frightening
or the absurd. Striking, too, is Larkin’s
ability to pick up an old theme —new-
born lambs waiting for spring, for in-
stance and quicken it with
“immeasurable surprise”.
Larkin has neither the violence of
Thom Gunn nor the verbal vigor of
Ted Hughes. His poems are suffused with
a tender attentiveness of response: alert,
lucid, domestic, suburban, the book’s
determining personality is one of the
most appealing in contemporary litera-
ture. Reading this book makes one
understand what Robert Lowell meant
when he Said recently that Larkin was
the most rewarding poet writing at pre-
sent in England.
E. E. Cummings’ 73 poems run true
to type. The book consists of a hand-
ful of fine, basically “old-fashioned”
lyrics almost lost in a profusion of in-
different pieces. It has always seemed to
me that Cummings’ poems are weak-
est where his typographical innovations
and his experiments with punctuation are
most extreme: the typography merely
masks the essential slightness and some-
times total triviality of what is being
said. But there are in this book a dozen
or more lyrics as original and as strong
as anything Cummings has written.

Odd Bird
Bird: The Legend of Charlie Parker.
Robert George Reisner. Mac Gibbon
& Kee. 375. 6d.
A variety of methods has been
employed to present the lives of
jazz musicians in book form. Most com-
mon, and least successful, is the “ghost-
ed” autobiography, a collaboration which
usually results in dull, flat prose and a
superficial treatment of the subject.
Actual biographies by jazzmen are
scarce; Louis Armstrong and Sidney
Bechet have made attempts using a tape-
recorder, Artie Shaw and Hoagy Car-
michael with the pen.
To tell the story of saxophonist
Charlie Parker, Robert Reisner has as-
sembled the views and reminiscences of
eighty-three people who, in one way or
another, have been closely connected
with Parker. These include fellow jazz-
men, friends, one of his five wives, his
mother, a psychiatrist, and a composer
of serious music. The result is one of
the most fascinating documents in the
literature of jazz.
Considering the subject, this is scarcely
surprising: Charlie “Bird” Parker was
the high priest of the Beat Generation
and the greatest hipster of them all. He
was also an authentic genius (by jazz
standards) and, as a human being, an
extraordinary mixture of strength and
weakness. Even the non-“ Bird” fancier
will be intrigued by his life story, par-
ticularly when presented in this unusual
way.
Parker was born in 1920 to a poor
Negro family in Kansas City and died
at the age of thirty-five in New York.
During this brief span he achieved world-
wide fame, changed the course of jazz,
and lived a nonconformist life of the
most extravagant extremes.
The conflicting picture which emerges
from the uncensored statements of Miles
Davis, Dizzie Gillespie, Earl Hines and
less well-known musicians is that of a
powerful if twisted personality: im-
mensely talented, unscrupulous, cunning,
charming, unreliable, generous, mean,
cruel, kind and combining the physical
appetites of a decadent giant with the
unpredictable tantrums of a spoiled
child. Few of the contributors agree on
his chameleon-like character; but,
whether he appeared to them as monster
or angel, all are unanimous about his
musicianship.
Whatever one’s feelings about “Bird”
as a man and a musician, it is impossible
to deny that his influence on jazz in the
’forties was as widespread and significant
as was Armstrong’s in the ’twenties.
Along with Gillespie and Thclonious
Monk, he gave jazz the new dimensions
of structure and feeling on which all
modern jazz is based. Parker’s own ver-
sion of the origin of bop is that he
became “bored with the stereotyped
changes (harmonies)” and “found that,
by using the higher intervals of a chord
as a melody line”, he could play the
new sounds that had been germinating
in his mind.
Despite chronic alcoholism and an
addiction to narcotics since the age of
fifteen, his musical thinking and co-
ordination remained unimpaired to the
time of his death in the Baroness de
Koenigswarter’s apartment. His concep-
tion of jazz depended on fast execu-
tion and split-second timing and, appar-
ently, he was able to perform with his
unusual mastery and artistry when a
lesser man would have been incapable
of standing.
As compiler Reisner says, “Bird was
neurotic, but the great strides in the arts
are not made by happy, well-adjusted
people. Parker was no humble genius.
He knew what he had and what went
into it. He said ‘I lit my fire, I greased
my skillet, and I cooked.’ ”
A handsome format, a profusion of
photographs, and a complete discography
add to the book’s value.

Straight Lines
Harry Seidler, 1955-1963. Horwitz
115 s.
handsome book is a continuation
of Harry Seidler’s earlier book
published in 1954. The short text is
very much the mixture as before and
is ambitiously rendered in English,
French and German. If the once-smart
device of Gill Sans type on glossy paper
is now slightly passe, the architecture is
not.
This is clear, direct and forceful archi-
tecture; architecture of conviction. It is
architecture of persuasion as well, for
after even the briefest glance through the
illustrations one is sure—temporarily at
least —that curve has no place in archi-
tecture and that straight lines and rectili-
near forms are the only possible ones for
buildings. But when an architect of the
high calibre of Harry Seidler arrives at
a formula as successful as his has been,
it would perhaps not be wise to depart
from it. Great architecture is not achieved
in the first flush of a new movement, but
only comes after constant practice and
polishing. And Harry Seidler’s work is
very polished, this book showing that the
depth of its patina has increased with
time. It is this constant polishing of his
work that has brought Harry Seidler into
the front rank so that he is spoken of
as an architect with respect in many
countries outside Australia.
In this book there is perhaps only one
building that could be described as a bad
building. Nearly all of them are superb,
as is the photography by which they are
depicted. Generous credit is given in the
book to the photographers, book design-
ers and editors who helped make the
book, and to the engineers and archi-
tectural assistants who helped Harry
Seidler create this truly astonishing col-
lection of splendid buildings. It could
be wished that the exact addresses of the
buildings could have been given instead
of only their general locations. Such
good architecture should be seen, not
just studied from photographs. Besides
which, future research should be able
to trace such important buildings im-
mediately.
Undoubtedly the most spectacular
feature of this book, as compared to the
earlier one, is the revelation that Harry
Seidler has advanced from mere houses
into the field of very big buildings. His
blocks of flats and his city buildings have
all the sureness of touch and archi-
tectural skill of his domestic work.
Altogether this adds up to what might
be described as a new edition of Harry
Seidler. And, like his book, this new
Harry Seidler is richly bound and pro-
fusely illustrated.

Osborne’s Romp
Tom Jones: a film script. John Os-
borne. Faber & Faber. 15s.
Tohn Osborne is not a delicate or a
** subtle writer at the best of times,
and rarely disguises his moral. He is bold
and lusty a waver of flags and a
shouter of slogans but he tempers his
enthusiasm with a bourgeois “taste”, and
an almost Jacobean “feel” for high
drama and low comedy. He has trans-
lated Fielding’s classic novel, “Tom
Jones”, into a marvellous film. The pub-
lished film-script captures the spirit of
the original. It is an uninhibited, bawdy
romp. The multiplying coincidences of
the plot, culminating in the riotous epi-
sode at the Upton Inn where everybody
is racing off to bed with everybody else,
are condensed so that some continuity
may be preserved, but none of the con-
fused slapstick fun is lost. The country
squires and London ladies are still
superb comic figures and their antics are
just as preposterous and just as delight-
ful.
Osborne hasn’t attempted to use a
period backdrop as a vehicle for con-
temporary ideas, as he did to an extent

in “Luther”. He has realised Fielding
and done him more than justice.
Nevertheless, the script is packed with
gimmicks. The pre-credits sequence is
shot with subtitles, often deliberately
superfluous for witty effect, as when a
close-up of the abandoned infant Tom is
subtitled “a baby”, and then “aban-
doned”, and Squire Allworthy’s reaction
“Aaah!” is posted on the screen as he
rushes to the door.
Throughout, a commentator makes
pithy observations on the action and the
lessons to be learned from it, in which
Osborne, with his tongue firmly in his
cheek, combines Fielding’s own words
with some sly jibes of his own. The
camera participates like a character in
the story, and Tom, especially, addresses
it directly. And at the end of the film,
where Tom and Sophie are at last united
and walk out on the balcony to the cheers
of the crowd, all the characters in the
film are there waving and the principals
appear on the balcony, waving back. All
these devices are not in the least con-
trived in their context, and add greatly
to the fun.
Film-scripts do not usually give much
indication of the film. The technical
directions and the breaking up of the
flow of the story into numbered shots
tend to destroy the feeling and the
humor. This is not so, however, with
“Tom Jones”.

“Up to Putty”?
The Changing World of Australia.

is tourist stuff by an author who,
for four years, was Director of the
Australian News and Information
Bureau in New York and who has been
Advisory Editor in Australia of the
“Encyclopaedia Americana”. However,
there is no cause to deprecate it. It is
a much more satifactory account of the
country and its history than those of
some professors I could name. It con-
tains a lot of summarised history of pro-
gress, a good many bits of folk lore,
some useful statistics, and some equally
useful charts.
There is a bibliography of sorts, which
is not impressive, and an “Australian
lexicon” which is not very comprehen-
sive or accurate. It calls the mulga “a
stunned acacia”; it catalogues Polwarth
sheep, but not Corriedales; it gives
“yabber”, but it omits that unpopular
word “yakka”; and it describes “swag-
man” as primarily meaning “an old-time
hobo” and only occasionally “an itine-
rant worker”—a definition which might
have got the author murdered by the
billabong in Western Queensland 60
years ago when “swagging it” was the
normal way for hundreds of respectable
workers to travel.
He also thinks a “billy” is a “large
pannikin in which water can be boiled”,
obviously confusing it with that universal
utensil of old days, the quart pot. He
believes a “damper” is a “large biscuit”,
thinks “play the game” is part of the
Australian idiom and obviously has never
heard of such characteristic phrases as
“up to putty”, “no good to gundi”, “the
bittamen”, “warrigal”, “pannikin boss”
and dozens more that are certainly indi-
genous and more native than his queer
selection. A few colloquial geographical
might also have been useful to tourists
—“the Cape”, the “OT”, “the Mitchell
Grass”, “Channel Country”. But in an
Australian lexicon which omits even
“schooner”, “middie”, “butcher” and
“two-up” that might be too much to
expect.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Chasing the Skilled Worker
npHE incessant cry for skilled labor is likely to reach a shrill
pitch if current world trends are maintained. Part of
the solution in the past has been to entice technicians and
skilled laborers from abroad.
But, with the rapid increase in industrial growth, particu-
larly in the Common Market countries, competition for the
right type of manpower has become intense.
The cost of labor has jumped sharply in the EEC countries
since 1958, with Italy showing a 30 p.c. rise and France not
far behind with a2O p.c. rise. It was part of the Common
Market agreement for the member countries to take in each
other's washing, thus permitting foreign workers to wander
around seeking better conditions over the horizon.
West Germany, faced with rapid resurgence after the war,
actively recruited labor until the foreign percentage of the
work force reached 4 p.c. Others quickly followed this pat-
tern and Switzerland, France, Sweden, Belgium, Luxembourg
and Austria wooed labor from Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey
and Portugal.
The Algerian fracas with France caused a number of workers
to seek another climate and some of these went as far as
Germany.
Lately, with the industrial tempo rising swiftly in Italy, the
Italian Government found that it had to stem the outflow of
skilled workers. Italian firms began to seek a return of their
workers, offering better wages and improved working condi-
tions.
The only European country which appears to be embar-
rassed by the influx of workers
is Switzerland, which took mea-
sures to restrict the flow of new-
comers.
The pattern which emerges
from Europe is that the un-
skilled workmen from poorer
class countries filled the un-
popular low-grade jobs in
countries like Germany, thus
permitting nationals to move up
into better-paid jobs. Now, with
wages going up in other parts
of Europe, recruitment of labor-
ers and semi-skilled workers is
becoming more difficult. The
round of wage increases, or in-
ducements, lower down the scale
is causing demands for wage
increases higher up the scale.
Encouragement of workers
to travel and seek employment
in other countries is rebounding
with a vengeance and today's
cost of shackling the itchy feet
of a skilled worker is putting
The Market in Biscuits
The graph above shows Australian biscuit production since
1958-59. Output for 1963-64 has been projected by assum-
ing that the full year's growth is at the same rate as for the
first six months. The US-owned Nabisco Pty Ltd has decid-
ed to enter the market after losing to Australian Biscuit Co.

a brake on growth and forcing the introduction of more labor-
saving machinery.
While this situation exists, Australia or any other country
will have a problem in attracting the right type of skilled
worker from Europe.
Anyone for a Bash
at Steel?
HThe spectre of steel nationalisation in Britain hovers over
■*- the political scene, with observers saying that Labor,
if elected, is committed to re-nationalisation or at least to
legislate for sufficient control of key companies to guarantee
competition between public and private steel sectors.
What, again? And if the Conservatives regain power
after Labor's term of office, the unscrambling process would
be a prior commitment.
It all seems so wasteful if expressed in terms of world
competition. Both political parties might be better employed
in considering the best means of grooming Britain's steel
industry for a possible entry into the European Economic
Community at some later date.
A few liberal thinkers in Britain today believe that, although
the British steel industry is functioning reasonably well under
the supervision of the Steel Board, the Board's powers are
very limited, outside of price
control and capital investment.
So they see greater scope for
research, development and
rationalisation (ironing out the
uneconomic producers) under
Government control.
There are a dozen points of
view, of course. Some see a
solution in part ownership of
the industry so as to prevent
price fixing and restrictive trade
practices. This avoids the dan-
ger of monopoly for either
side.
Others say that the existing
Steel Board should be given
more power, including a speci-
fic right to take over private
steel companies for defence or
default (a solution advanced by
Mr Herbert Morrison in 1949
but rejected by the Attlee Gov-
ernment).
This “big stick” technique of
keeping steel companies in


line . . . toe the line or get taken over ... is more acceptable
to industry than nationalisation.
There are plenty of arguments to the contrary, including
the fear that while Britain is playing ducks and drakes with
her steel industry other nations, including the European Coal
and Steel Community, could be stealing a march. Another
argument is that too rigid control of an industry could restrict
its chances of diversification into alternative materials or
other investments.
Either way, the steel football is going to get a solid punt
at the British voting polls this year.
There’s Lots of Money
in Biscuits
Just to confirm that there is money in biscuits, the latest
** report of United Biscuits Ltd, Edinburgh, Scotland, shows
a turnover of £stg33.7 million in 1963, from which a profit
of £stg2.oB million was earned after tax and depreciation.
Selling extends to 50 countries and the principal market is
Canada.
The company made a three-for-five bonus last November
(the fourth since 1955). If 100 £1 ordinary shares costing
£125 had been purchased in 1948, the holder would now
own 960 10s. ordinary shares worth around £stgl72s on
the market.
Plain Talk on the Realities
of Japan-Australia Trade
J ast week’s Sydney sessions of the Trade with Japan Export
Seminar heard more home truths than have been usual
at most get-togethers of this nature.
Attention was certainly paid to the oft-repeated mechanics
of exporting (advertising, packaging and the like). Yet the
meetings also had to listen to realistic and specific expositions
of the political and economic conditions influencing Japan-
Australia relations.
Self-criticism is necessary in attempting to answer the un-
sparing forthrightness of the Japanese Commercial Consul,
Mr N. Amaya. He left Australian industrialists plenty to
chew over.
“It is true that most of Australia’s industrialists have am-
bitions for overseas markets,” Mr Amaya said. “But it is the
domestic market that they cherish, adopting towards it pos-
sessive, exclusionist attitudes which to the outsider are remi-
niscent of the resistance of the squatters in the last century
to the closer settlement which meant so much to the develop-
ment and prosperity of primary industry in this country.”
Outsiders are not alone in asking for a candid re-appraisal
of the Australian tariff structure. Mr Amaya pressed some
critical points to emphasise the value of lessening “the variety
of import replacement industries” in order to strengthen “a
few selected, dynamic, sophisticated industries each of which
relies mainly upon export”.
Instead of striving for large export surpluses with densely
populated Asian countries, it may be necessary to recognise
the longer-term advantages of granting some concessions when
an inevitable request comes to redress the trade imbalance.
Of course, a very great amount of special pleading lies
behind this Japanese portrayal of the situation. Japan’s own
balance-of-payments problem increasingly demands a consider-
able life in exports.
Mr Tatsvzo Mizukami, president of the huge Mitsui com-
bine, made that obvious during his recent visit. Australian
industry will clearly have to cope with Japan’s desire to
export such things as heavy electrical equipment, chemicals
and fertilisers.
Japan’s immediate balance-of-payments anxieties are com-
plicated by a record imports bill for the financial year ended
March 31 and its assumption of open economy status.
Rumors abound that Japan has just found it necessary to
withdraw $5O million from a $l5O million “swap” account
with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to stiffen foreign
exchange reserves.
Copper in the Spotlight
of Speculation
Tt is probably very much to the good’ that Australia’s newer
copper prospects are being developed away from a hectic
atmosphere of speculative fever. Investors can sharpen their
skills sufficiently by attempting to calculate additions to the
earning power of Broken Hill South and, to a lesser extent,
Conzinc Riotinto.
World conditions still cannot help impinging on the domestic
situation. Overseas price turbulence is well shown by the
fact that Australian bounty support, based on London Metal
Exchange levels, has now cut out.
The latest LME rates have displayed some feverish oscilla-
tions in the face of the much lower producers’ price fixed by
the big Rhodesian miners. This latter price is coming more
and more under pressure.
Producers naturally want to avoid any significant rises
making copper more vulnerable to substitute materials. But
they are also being goaded by the Chilean Government,
anxious to reap benefit from the present state of high demand.
Price rise or no, Chile is on the verge of implementing
a bill imposing a levy on unrefined copper exports.
Under all these influences, world producers are planning
for an early conference at Montreal. The site draws added
attention because of the extraordinary ore strike by Texas
Gulf Sulphur at Timmins in Northern Ontario.
Through a welter of US and Canadian share-buying it is
emerging that Timmins contains far more than the 25
million tons initially estimated. Copper content is remark-
ably high and the ore can be simply mined by open-cut. The
supply, as well as price, position grows exceedingly interesting!
Integrating Stock Exchange
Communications
rr>HE half-yearly report of the Stock Exchange of Melbourne
-*• reveals that the Exchange is shortly to install a computer
which will open the W'ay to an integrated computer commu-
nications system covering Australian stock exchanges. The
report says the system offers immensely improved facilities
for dissemination of information to the public throughout Aus-
tralia, and in addition will link the Associated Exchanges in
such a way that a broader and national market would be
created.
Initially, a series of tests is to be performed in relation to
stage one, which constitutes an innovation for Australia. This
envisages the introduction of the familiar ticker-tape machines,
which have been used overseas for many years. These
machines will give an up-to-the-minute story of the transac-
tions taking place (in tape and, if desired, on a moving screen
display). Information on quotations and some details of
company reports will also be given.
Twice a day, at the close of morning and afternoon sessions,
a comprehensive coverage of the market will also be trans-
mitted. It is also envisaged that this service will be made
available to stockbrokers, financial institutions, banks, hotels
and airways.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Should the Price of Gold be Increased?
A comment on lan Shannon’s new hook, “International Liquidity ”
Tt is a far cry from the pure gold
standard days of Josiah Stamp but,
in an age of adulterated exchange stan-
dards, contemporary writers on gold can
be just as dedicated to the metal as the
old ones. The trouble is that, in a world
where most currencies have drifted so
far from gold (even if in spite of every-
thing and thanks to the IMF most have
managed to keep as stable as they were
under the gold standard), an unrational
approach has not proved enough to give
the world the liquidity it needs either
to make the task of managing national
currencies as easy as it could be, or, un-
inhibited by balance-of-payments strains,
to get on with the full score of awaiting
development.
For instance, it could be quite rational
to suggest that if the US was really con-
cerned to stop the drain of gold from
the country, after having kept the price
of gold stable at 35 dollars an ounce
for the last 30 years it might now try
putting up the price. Better still, it
could stop buying and selling gold alto-
gether (as the US Treasury has done with
silver), obliging foreign countries to hold
their shares of United States’ balance-
of-payments deficits in dollars. In either
case the effect on US exports might be
most salutary.
In advocating an increase in the price
of gold in his new book, “International
Liquidity”, published by F. W. Cheshire,
lan Shannon is not, of course, thinking
of US exports or even of reducing that
country’s payments deficit. Nor is he
thinking of a unilateral increase in the
gold price by the US, which would
mean that dollars would be worth less
in terms of other national currencies
not following suit. Because of the
“loss” of purchasing power of a cur-
rency devaluated unilaterally, it is vital
to the raising of the gold price that it
be universal, for all important curren-
cies—vital, that is, to the grand design
of Shannon and others who see in a big
universal increase in the price of gold
a panacea for the world’s liquidity ills.
is the second time in two years that
I Shannon has shown his hand on
gold, the current book being allied to
his “Economic Functions of Gold” pub-
lished in 1962. Doubtless he has been
I mainly stimulated to new efforts of per-
j suasion by the threats implicit for
j world liquidity in the big efforts of the
United States to reduce its balance-of-
payments deficit, which has been the
major contributor to the outside world's
international reserves in the postwar
period. Equally, he could be more dis-
illusioned than ever by the failure of
major currency countries to agree on an
alternative to a planned increase in the
price of gold as a means of supplement-
ing international reserves. Also, he now
speaks of the possibility of an increase
in the price of gold eventually coming
by default as in the thirties, through a
cycle of devaluations. But maybe he is
not too serious about that possibility.
As well as repeating chunks of the
argument of “Economic Functions of
Gold" and, with an expert hand, guiding
us through the maze of the current
world liquidity situation with its central
weakness of a United States hell-bent to
reduce its payments deficit, on this oc-
casion Shannon has gone more deeply
into some fundamental economic changes
and international relationships to back
his call for a substantial increase in inter-
national reserves.
global treatment of these themes
(but not the rest of the argument) gets
irritatingly vague at times and one gets
the impression that, sound as the econo-
mics may be, this new stuff is rather
academic. A lot of it smacks of the
generalised treatment one expects from
an international agency expert and is of
too broad a sweep to be altogether con-
vincing. This is not to say that his
plunges into world economics are not
thought-provoking. But they are hardly
calculated to turn the stubborn heads of
the US Treasury from sticking to 35
dollars an ounce, an attitude which the
author finds as incomprehensible as
the general tolerance of “muddling
along" on the liquidity front.
One of his basic supporting arguments
is that in technology the world is ad-
vancing more rapidly than international
liquidity and that the growing insuffi-
ciency of reserves is putting various
economies (notably those attempting
rapid industrialisation) into straitjackets,
inhibiting their growth at the possible
and desired rate.
Another formidable reason he ad-
vances for increasing international
liquidity is a need to expand the flow of
capital and aid from developed to under-
developed countries. He is looking for
a way to achieve a greater degree of
equilibrium between the collectively
richer industrial countries and the col-
lectively poorer primary countries. Yet
he wants the means to justify the end,
to attain a method of balancing inter-
national trade and payments which also
promotes the successful economic deve-
lopment of the poorer nations, not
merely the development of their primary
industries but the speeding of their in-
dustrial development as well. The empha-
sis is on providing the right level of inter-
national liquidity to support an uninter-
rupted and rising stream of new capital
for them, because he finds it unlikely
that the export earnings of the primary
producing countries will be sufficient to
promote a quick rise in living standards.
npHE present-day world is in a dilemma,
says Shannon. While an increase
in external assistance is needed by the
poorer countries for both balance-of-
payments reasons and welfare considera-
tions, increased capital and aid from the
richer countries could produce such a
drain on the reserves of individual
donors that corrective action becomes
imperative.
So he thinks that fundamentally the
choice facing the world lies between
increasing the total level of international
liquidity to match the long-term capital-
outflow/repayment-inflow cycle more
closely and limiting the capital transfers
below the optimum for achieving balance
in the international economy. Accepting
the first alternative, the urgent require-
ment is to create more net reserves with-
out a credit nexus. An increase in gross
reserves say by an expansion of
borrowing facilities only begs the
question, for each addition to the total
quantity of reserves presupposes a pro-
portional shortening of uncommitted net
reserves outstanding.
Some indication of the size of the in-
crease required is apparent from Shan-
non's figures showing the needs of the
world economy. He considers the
future external capital requirements of
the under-developed countries will be
between 15 and 20 billion dollars each
year.
The lower limit of 15 billion dollars
is equal to 1.6 p.c. of the 1962 gross
national product of the 10 major donor
countries collectively and 2.7 p.c. of the
United States America being richer
than all the other nine countries put
together. Shannon believes that such a
transfer in itself should not represent
any particular strain on the resources of
the donor countries.


“CROESUS”
Life in the Old Act Yet
Getting at restrictive practices indirectly
■fl/HEN explaining the Government’s
" restrictive practices proposals to the
Victorian Employers' Federation semi-
nar the other day, the Federal Attorney-
General said there may come a
time when the Australian Industries
Preservation Act could well be repealed.
In the meantime and unlike most of his
predecessors, Mr Snedden certainly 7
seems to be finding some useful work
for it, both as a guinea pig to test the
constitutional scope of the proposed re-
strictive practices legislation and also as
a weapon against restraint of trade.
Having given tyre manufacturers and
Canberra victuallers a reminder in recent
months that the 1906 Act has a kick in
it, it is now the turn of the Australian
and New Zealand Eastern Shipping Con-
ference to get a writ under the Act for
alleged action in restraint of trade con-
cerning in particular a Victorian pro-
prietary shipping company that had
dared to penetrate the preserves of the
Conference, which includes nearly all
the international companies operating
Eastern Pacific routes.
Unfortunately for the Victorian ship-
ping company, Meyer Heine, which is
named in the writ as an aggrieved party
it is alleged that actions of the Con-
ference prejudiced the company in ob-
taining cargoes both in Japan and Aus-
tralia the w'rit comes rather late in
the day to stop a run-down in the com-
pany's business and the dismissal of
employees. Doubtless the enterprising
executives of the company would soon
pick things up again should the Com-
monwealth Government's allegations be
proved.
"VTot to speak of Meyer Heine, the
beauty of this case from the Attor-
ney-General’s viewpoint, and indeed from
community's, is that it is a copy-book
example of the small company attempt-
ing to horn in on the trade’s virtual
monopoly. Not that Mr Walter Heine,
the head of Meyer Heine, is an amateur
in the shipping business. In fact, his
family had been in shipping in Europe
for a hundred years or more but this all
disappeared under Hitler. He has only
been operating out here since the war,
when he came here as a refugee and
remained to re-establish himself in ship-
ping by starting a business in Melbourne
while at the same time reopening the
old family firm in Frankfurt.
From the beginning of his efforts here
he has been treading on the toes of
giants, including BHP. John Lysaght and
the present recipients of the Attorney-
General's writ. He first came to notice
w'hen he under-cut existing freight rates
on Japanese steel exported to New
Zealand, thus appearing to prejudice tra-
ditional BHP and John Lysaght steel
exports to NZ, which were carried
largely by the Conference Line. The
Conference was obliged to low'er its rates
to meet Heine's competition. It will be
remembered that when this threatened to
cut back our exports of steel to NZ, it
was Mr Heine who was willing to re-
store the rate, w'hile the Conference held
back, saying a decision would rest w'ith
its Japanese members.
Qince then, Mr Heine has pressed the
Conference on more general trade
and with more chartered ships. The Con-
ference is alleged to have retaliated with
a vengeance, with the result that Com-
monwealth police visited its Canberra
offices to ask for documents. Hence the
current writs.
The puzzling thing is why recourse
to this procedure of complaint, exami-
nation and action under the Act has been
so infrequent over the years. It is as
if the Government, as well as those who
have been victims of restraints of trade,
had only recently woken up both to the
existence of the Act and to the harmful
effects of some restrictive practices alike.
One presumes there must have been
many of the latter in the last half cen-
tury and, in view of the Government’s
wider proposals now, one must also pre-
sume there are existing evils unless,
of course, the Attorney-General is simply
imagining things. What with all the all-
embracing new proposals and the more
frequent recourse to writs under the
old Act, the rain is certainly pouring
on this front.
But does not the action against the
Conference Line again raise the doubt
whether the new restrictive practices
proposals are needed at all: whether, in
fact, the power to get at the obnoxious
practices hasn't been there all the time?
It is surely relevant to these questions
that, whereas the writs against the tyre
manufacturers and the victuallers have
been brought under Section 7 of the
Act (which covers monopolistic prac-
tices, exclusive dealing and so on), the
writ against the shipping conference has
been drawn under Sections 4 and 9,
Section 4 being directed at acts of re-
straining trade and Section 9 covering the
same actions performed outside Aus-
tralia and also implicating knowledgeable
third parties. This illustrates the wide
range of restrictive practices falling
within the scope of the Australian In-
dustries Preservation Act.
One of its clauses relevant to the
shipping writ, Section 4, states explicitly
that “any person who, either as principal
or as agent, makes or enters into any
contract, or is or continues to be a mem-
ber of or engages in any combination, in
relation to trade or commerce with other
countries or among the states (a) in
restraint of or with intent to restrain
trade or commerce, or (b) to the destruc-
tion or infury of or with intent to destroy
or injure by means of unfair competition
any Australian industry the preservation
of which is advantageous to the Com-
monwealth, having due regard to the
interests of producers, workers and con-
sumers is guilty of an offence.” The
penalty for the offence is £5OO or in the
case of a continuing offence, £5OO for
each day during w'hich the offence
continues.
The other, Section 9, states “Who-
ever aids, abets, counsels or procures, or
by act or omission in any way, directly
or indirectly is knowingly concerned in
or privy to (a) the commission of any
offence against this part of this Act. or
(b) the doing of an act outside Australia
which would, if done within Australia,
be an offence against this part of this
Act, shall be deemed to have committed
the offence.” The penalty is £5OO.
rpHE clauses are surely drawn widely
-*■ enough to trap anybody, though it
must be admitted that a penalty of £5OO
is chickenfeed today compared, say, with
1906 when it was fixed. Probably be-
cause over the years nobody has taken
sufficient note of the facility with which
grievances can be examined under the
Act, the Crowrn has not bothered to
make the modern penalties fit the crime.
These should be revised to take account
of the fall in the value of the pound
since 1906.
Penalties apart, those, presumably
including the Attorney-General’s Depart-
ment, who have been under the impres-
sion that the old Act is toothless, must
now have second thoughts about whether
a few successful actions under it would
not prove to obviate the necessity of
new' legislation with all its time-wasting,
detailed and burdensome procedures.
One seriously doubts whether the re-
cent writs issued under the Act derive
from any change of heart by the
Attorney-General, because all of them
have originated from grievances, which
on study by his department have crystal-
lised into legal charges. Yet surely they
must suggest to him that there is a lot to
be said for getting to'the examination
stage of restrictive practices by the
grievance or complaint route rather than
by proscription and registration.


Can-makers Look to Technical Advances
Other packaging materials furnish strong competition
TMTodern packaging trends in Australia
■*‘ TA have given impetus to the use of
the tin can as a leader among containers
for an enormous range of products.
Developments in the last few years, such
as the beer and soft-drink can, have
caused a large expansion in capacity and
production.
Tinplate production is at a high level,
with production for December last year
1352 tons higher than the December,
1962, output of 18,853 tons. Production
for 1962-63 of 210,142 tons was nearly
double the previous year’s 106,985 tons.
This, however, does not reveal the num-
ber of tin cans being made, but indica-
tions are that it is increasing.
A spokesman for the brewing indus-
try said it was canning more beer every
year and that the trend would continue.
; Canning of soft drinks also is on the
I rise. Production of other goods sold
in cans, such as paint, is increasing,
foreshadowing an expanding demand
for cans. Although the Commonwealth
Statistician does not compile figures on
canned food, it too must be growing to
keep pace with a rising population.
The three big can-making companies,
Queensland Can, J. Gadsden and Con-
tainers Ltd, show mixed results. J.
Gadsden, for instance, reports steady
profits but has reduced its interim divi-
dend to bolster reserves. Queensland
Can, on the other hand, says sales, pro-
fit and production figures are “slightly
below those at this time last year”.
Containers Ltd has not yet re-
leased an interim report, but,
at the presentation of its 1963
balance sheet, said the selling
price for cans was somewhat
lower than the previous year
and reported a slightly higher
profit.
Managing director of Queens-
land Can Ltd, Mr A. H. Pet-
field, said figures were lower in
the canister division than last
year. “However, we are largely
dependent on seasonal condi-
tions and, as a result, sales of
some of our products, relative
to last year, may be delayed.
Profit is further reduced by
some increased costs which have not,
at this stage, been offset by rises in sell-
ing prices.”
The increased costs Mr Petfield
referred to do not concern the cost of
raw materials which, he says, “is
approximately the same as five years
ago. Then we were still dependent in
Part on overseas supplies of tinplate.
Use of the tin can in Australia
has grown rapidly since the war
and it is now one of the most
widely used packaging mediums.
Development of high-speed pro-
duction and printing techniques has
kept can prices at reasonable levels.
Greater Australian production of
tinplate has meant reduced imports
and lower prices. Companies in
the field do not see glass as a
growing threat to their business.
They confidently forecast a sound
future.
Australian tinplate is now more freely
available and is lower in cost but, at
the same time, other minor raw material
costs have risen. Our cost of produc-
tion has increased because of the in-
crease in the cost of labor (particularly
in the last 12 months) and some other
services”.
Mr Petfield said the use of cans for
soft drink and beer in Queensland was
limited. “Major production and use of
soft drink and beer cans is in other
States but we are expecting local de-
mand to increase over the next few
years. Some other products may be
packed in cans in the future. In the
case of oil, main distribution is in cans
or drums, bottles only being used for
point-of-sale distribution at garages.
This is not in line with overseas prac-
tice, but oil companies have consider-
able capital invested in fittings.
“The possibility of selling oil in seal-
ed cans is being continually discussed
with the parties concerned. There is
always the possibility that some pro-
ducts now packed in cans or bottles
may move into other packaging
fields, for instance plastics or composite
containers.”
Mr Petfield sees refinements of the
can in Australia. “There is no doubt
that such items as the aluminium zip-
top or lift-top will appear in Australia.
So, too, will the all-aluminium can,
though we are expecting that for some
time aluminium will have a restricted
use in cans it’s still a relatively
expensive raw material.”
Competition both within the industry
and from outside forms of packaging
is intense, yet manufacturers expect that
many items which have been tradition-
ally packed in cans will continue to be
canned and that new lines will be
added. Cans and bottles as packages
should continue in the same relative
volumes as now. The industry has
experienced some competition from the
“glass can”, the small, non-returnable
bottle which contains a similar amount
of beer as the can. Mr Petfield said its
main advantage “is the lower selling
price of the filled bottle”.
With the strong competition, the
industry seems to suffer slightly from
over-capacity. Future increasing demand
will probably provide a cure.
Mr Petfield forecast that most deve-
lopments in the can-making industry
would be in special techniques. “Can-
making and its ancillary processes, such
as tin printing and coating, are highly
technical processes and most develop-
ments will probably be in special tech-
niques. It is anticipated that
volume of production and sales
will increase, but with additional
technical services now available
to our customers, which natu-
rally mean additional cost, it is
not anticipated that profits will
increase proportionately.
“For the future it seems that
the small food-canner will
gradually be eased out and can-
ning will be concentrated among
the larger processors. Develop-
ments in special techniques will
probably include the use of
more high-speed (and more
expensive) machinery, and new
processes for the canning of new pro-
ducts.
“At present there is an overall reduc-
tion in the canning of some products,
for instance meat, but we do not expect
this will continue indefinitely,” Mr Pet-
field added.

ers Ltd, said breweries were the can-
makers’ biggest customers. He said
his sales and output had risen. NSW
production in the last quarter of 1963
had almost caught up to the rate of
production of the Melbourne division,
the head office.
“The industry is growing all the
time,” he said, “and so are the uses of
cans. The use of cans in the aerosol
field is expanding. Sales of beer cans
is unbelievably high. Over the last
seven or eight years metal has taken the
place of glass in quite a number of
fields. Floor polishes and detergents
are just two instances. But we still
experience a lot of competition from
other forms of packaging such as plas-
tics and glass. There is strong inter-
nal as well as external competition.
Cans for talc and sweets, for instance,
are imported empty and filled here.
“Because of the competition, costs to
the consumer are coming down. This,
as well as a lower tinplate price plus
better machinery, has offset wage in-
creases. Paint cans have been coming
down very significantly. Overseas com-
petition is always there. If you step out
of line on price you will quickly lose
your business either to an internal
competitor or one from overseas. We
must offer a very keen price to be able
to export. We export to New Zealand,
the Philippines and Thailand and al-
though it is only a fraction of our pro-
duction we hope to be able to expand
it in the future.”
The “zip-top” can would not come to
Australia for some time, Mr Besemeres
considered. “It would add to the cost
of the can and I don’t think it would
be as popular here as it has been in
the US.”
He felt there was over-capacity in the
industry because of the large amount of
machinery available. “As it is at the
moment, companies making cans can
fill any order without any trouble. But
the can-making industry will go from
strength to strength in the future. There
will be developments like high-speed
can-making machinery which could
reduce costs. We may import tech-
niques from America, where they have
under way a project to make cans by
a completely different process.”
Whether or not competition from
other forms of packaging becomes
stronger remains to be seen. At any
rate the industry's outlook seems
assured.
Interestingly enough, in Britain last
year cans made inroads on bottles.
However, sales of glass containers of
all types rose slightly, despite competi-
tion from tin and plastic.

A generally tighter period is usually
expected in the June quarter, when the
flush of export receipts dies away and
income tax payments are met. This
year the strong brew of liquidity may
have altered the pattern somewhat, but
the Reserve Bank has taken steps to
dilute the mixture.
With this thought in mind, several
brokers have been recommending new
issue rights, based on the assumption that
not everyone will be liquid enough to
apply for his full quota.
★ ★ ★
T>ye Industries’ one-for-four issue of
ss. shares at par closes on June 1
and at least one broker believes the
rights should be good buying at around
14s. to give a new share valued at 19s.
This puts a fairly high value on the ss.
shares and yields only 2.6 p.c. after pay-
ing 3d. brokerage. But Pye shares have
been offering low market yields for some
time. The market has been impressed
by the company’s high earning rate
which, although dipping to 21.2 p.c. in
1961-62, recovered sharply to 43.9 p.c.
last year.
This provides ample cover for the
10 p.c. dividend.
In addition to its solid position in the
radio, TV, and electronic equipment
manufacturing industry, Pye owns an
automotive subsidiary which is claimed
to supply 60 p.c. of all carburettors and
75 p.c. of all air cleaners fitted to Aus-
tralian-assembled motor vehicles.
A point to keep in mind, if buying
the rights, is that there is a 6d. dividend
difference, which means that the cost of
the rights, plus ss. application money,
should remain 6d. below the price of the
j old shares.

YTow that Ready Mixed Concrete has
rejected the joint offer from CSR
and RMC (UK), it must face up to the
prospect of meeting competition from
such sources. CSR and RMC (UK) have
taken steps to register a company name
in Canberra and indicate that they will
not approach RMC again. Apparently,
if RMC wants them as partners, it will
; need to re-open negotiations itself.
RMC directors may feel happy that
they have repelled any immediate ad-
vances from outside (even though it was
not a complete takeover offer) but the
question now is whether it would be
better off accepting the offer or trying
to stand up to the competition now
forecast.
One thing to remember, however.
Anyone starting up today must pay
higher establishment costs than those
who became established some years ago.

T>ioneer Sugar boosted the hopes of
sugar share speculators but Fairy -
mead was a dampener. Pioneer trebled
its profit, but Fairymead only doubled
its profit. Also, Fairymead warned that
rain to the end of March was below
average and, without a good soaking, the
1964 crop would be less than in 1963.
With world sugar prices down from
around the TstglOO mark to £stg69
a ton, the enthusiasts have had second
thoughts.
There is no doubt immediate prospects
are good for the sugar producers, but the
long-term outlook should be kept in per-
spective.

ACF and Shirleys Fertilizers’ rights
have jumped well above their
theoretical value, but the recent report
of a strong demand for fertiliser has
caused a hardening of most fertiliser
shares.
Applications do not close until June
30, so if there is any weakening in prices
for this three-for-four issue at ss. pre-
mium (255. to pay on top of the price
of the rights), the rights may be worth
picking up. At least the brokerage is
cheaper than paying for the old shares.
★ ★ ★
11/fosT fertiliser shares are tightly held
and the Cresco Fertilisers group,
including Cresco (WA), are sometimes
hard to acquire at what should be a
reasonable price.
Wallaroo-Mt Lyell Fertilisers offers a
better yield than most in the field.
This type of share, of course, is for
the long-term haul.

Consolidated Gold’s old technique
As it is very experienced in this sort
** of manoeuvre, few would doubt the
success of Consolidated Gold Fields
(Australia) Pty Ltd in purchasing half
the issued capital of Bellambi Coal Co.
Ltd.
The price of 17s. 6d. offered for half
of each holding is of interest to share-
holders, who have not been able to
obtain this price on the market since
1961.
Initial approach was to Mcllwraith
McEacharn Ltd, through which Consoli-
dated Gold Fields obtained a 17.5 p.c.
interest in Bellambi (Mcllwraith thus
sold more than half its holding).
Bellambi’s achievement in securing
a contract from Japanese steel and che-
mical companies to supply 1.25 million
tons of coal over three years apparently
attracted the attention of the Consoli-
dated Gold Fields group.
The Australian company successfully
employed the 50 p.c. technique with
Wyong Minerals Ltd (in 1961-62) and
with Associated Minerals Consolidated
Ltd in 1961. Previously in 1960, Com-
monwealth Mining Investments had
issued a large parcel of shares to Con-
solidated Gold Fields’ American com-
pany to give it a majority interest.
Through these three companies the Gold
Fields group controls more than half the
world’s supply of rutile.
An English Gold Fields subsidiary also
bought out half of R. H. Lawrenson
Ltd in 1961, to give it an interest in alu-
minium beer barrels.
Bellambi is one of the few independ-
ent colliers outside Australian Iron and
Steel (BHP) and Rio Tinto Collieries
(CRA) on the southern coalfields of
NSW.
Hard coking coal is won from the
Bulli seam at Bellambi. On the 1960
recommendations of an American expert,
the company spent £1.3 million on a
mechanisation and development pro-
gramme to construct “a new mine within
an old one”.
The Federal Coke Co. Ltd, with
coking works at Wollongong, was bought
in late 1959, and the Mount Pleasant
Coke Co. Pty in 1962, to tie up sales
outlets.
Big Sister Still Growing
Tt pays to read the fine print and
accompanying notes in an annual
report. For here, Big Sister Foods Ltd
had given the clue in 1963 to the latest
one-for-four bonus.
The directors’ report in 1963 read:
“During the year the freehold property
of the subsidiary was revalued and out
of the resulting surplus of £131,449 a
bonus issue of £129,998 was declared
to the parent company.”
Group land and buildings at valua-
tion increased £150,000 over the year,
as explained in the notes forming part
of the accounts.
So directors have pulled out another
plum for shareholders, continuing the
tradition of the 1962 one-for-four
bonus and the one-for-three in 1958.
This specialty food-maker finds no
difficulty in extending the factory (al-
though plans were deferred for a year
or so) while at the same time commit-
ting itself to pay a final dividend for
1963-64 on the bonus shares.
Whether the company will hold the
15 p.c. dividend on the higher capital
has not been specifically stated by the
company. Yet it can almost be taken
for granted, short of exceptional cir-
cumstances.
Big Sister even surprised its most
devoted followers. The ss. shares
lifted from 38s. to 425. 6d. They
weren’t easy to pick up at that price
either. Any easing in price could pro-
vide an opportunity to pick up a proved
performer.
Coles’ Golden Birthday
fpHE one-for-ten premium issue to be
A made by G. J. Coles is apparently
the birthday present which shareholders
have been expecting this year to celebrate
the company’s fiftieth anniversary.
Something of this nature has been
awaited since last October’s annual
meeting, when the then chairman, Sir
Kenneth Coles, said 1963-64 would be
a fitting time for the company to
acknowledge its indebtedness to the
people who had made the organisation
what it was. “I refer to our customers,
shareholders, suppliers, employees and
executives”, he said.
As all these people will be rewarded,
it is understandable that the shareholders
could not be given too big a present,
because this would be to the detriment
of others. But there must be many
long faces among the numerous investors
who had been expecting an issue of a
much higher ratio. They should re-
member, however, that such a move
would warrant a much bigger premium
on the ss. shares than the 2s. 6d. loading
on the present issue, especially as the
scrip is fetching between 18s. and 19s.
on the stock markets.
The company itself should eventually
see wide-ranging benefits from the issue,
as the £3.3 million raised will be used
for expansion. This cash comes on top
of a half million pound raising through
a private share placement announced on
April 30. In the long run, expansion
should ultimately benefit the shareholders
anyway, through higher profits, dividends
and share prices.
Coles have plenty of plans on hand
to absorb the new funds. In February
the new chairman and controlling mana-
ging director, Sir Edgar Coles, said
plans for further supermarket develop-
ment were to be accelerated. He was
speaking at the opening of a “New
World” supermarket at Maidstone
(Vic.). This was the group’s seventh
Victorian “NW”. Fifty of these have
been established in Australia (mainly
NSW) in the past 18 months and another
15 are planned to be operating before
1964 runs out.

If past history is any indication, the
dynamic Coles organisation will make
sure that all this expansion is successful;
that is, profitable. Lor this reason,
shareholders need not be moaning about
their paltry one-for-ten issue. They will
benefit in the long run. The directors
have saved them from seeing the falling
earning rates (which usually accompany
the teething stages of new expansion)
by keeping the increases in paid capital
to a minimum.
Wunderlich Pipes Down
venture of Wunderlich Ltd, Syd-
"*■ ney-based building materials maker,
into asbestos cement pipes, jointly with
the experienced Humes Ltd, has been a
costly business.
To date it has lost £507,265, of which
£297,436 was in the latest year to Octo-
ber 31. Wunderlich and Humes had
each put in £500,000 in equity capital.
Now Wunderlich has felt compelled to
write this down to £200,000.
A sum of £430,000 had also been ad-
vanced by Wunderlich to Wunderlich
Humes Asbestos Pipes Pty. Wunderlich’s
total involvement in the pipe company
was therefore in the region of £930,000,
a pretty considerable sum when mea-
sured against its total issued capital of
£1,965,834.
Plants were set up at Sunshine (Vic.)
and Parramatta (NSW). There were
starting-up problems in 1961-62, and
securing a share of a tight market w'as
difficult. Wunderlich directors now
admit that profitable trading is still “some
distance in the future.”
Investors should note that Humes Ltd
will probably feel bound to write down
its asbestos pipe investment similarly.
However, Humes is roughly twice as big
as Wunderlich, so the write-down will be
of relatively lesser importance.
Being a 50-50 venture, the asbestos
pipe results were not consolidated in
Wunderlich’s trading results, which
showed little improvement on last year.
Net profit moved up from £310,074 to
£313,824. Earning rate rose fractionally
to 16.7 p.c., but is significantly below the
average 20 p.c. or so of the previous six
years.
Orders at October 31 were a record,
and the company felt there were better
opportunities in the year ahead. But
competition is still intense and margins
low.
Rural Benefits
"VrEWCASTLE rural and industrial buil-
ders R. and N. Statham Ltd, is
expanding and needs extra funds to
develop new and related manufacturing
activities.
It has raised £250,000 in long-term
debentures and proposes to collect a
further £183,000 from a two-for-five
issue of ss. shares at 2s. 6d. premium.
The new shares will rank for dividend
as from July 1, 1964.
Statham is making the most of buoy-
ant conditions in rural areas. Sales in
the December six months rose up 22 p.c.
Last year it earned 21.3 p.c. on capital
and distributed 10 p.c.
The current high price of around 13s.
(yield of 3.8 p.c.) no doubt owes a lot
to Newcastle supporters.
Simalex’s Expansive Recovery
Oimalex Ltd, the Melbourne-based
manufacturing chemist and distri-
butor of electrical appliances, seems to
be in the middle of a period of expan-
sion. In 1962-63 profit fell from
£BO,OOO to £63,000 (to equal only 12.7
p.c. on capital) because of losses in the
electrical division, w'hich has subse-
quently been reorganised. However, the
directors’ report for the nine months
to March 31 suggests that the recoveries
shown during that term w'ere not all
due to the newly profitable electrical
division.
Group profit in the nine months rose
by one third after a sales increase of
40 p.c. Although electrical sales shared
in this increase, the board points out
that margins are still narrow. Lor this
reason the profit lift must be mainly
attributable to the “substantial” sales
increase in the chemical lines and the
50 p.c. gain scored by the fibre-can
division.
These facts reflect expansion and |

apparently directors feel that the trend
will continue. They say the fibre-can
division has bought a further area for
manufacturing and storage accommoda-
tion, while the plastics division has
acquired some neighboring premises
and purchased another blow-moulding
plant to cater for the expansion plan-
ned in 1964-65.
So, the outlook for this year and
1964-65 is very rosy. After last year’s
result, many shareholders feared for the
safety of their investment, as they were
facing the current year with a higher
capital figure to contend with after a
one-for-five par issue and an unsecured
note issue which was only 28.8 p.c.
subscribed. Few people took much
notice of the 1962-63 annual report
which said that this additional finance
would help, not hinder, the attaining
of a satisfactory profit.
Gollin Solidifies
T'he share market appreciated news
A from Melbourne-based merchant
and manufacturer Gollin Holdings Ltd
that profit had shown a moderate in-
crease for the six months to February 29.
Gollin’s ss. shares have firmed from
around 9s. to 9s. lid., where they return
4.5 p.c.
The company had a couple of lean
years in 1961 and 1962, primarily in
the steel subsidiaries, but John Brunton
(Steel) Holdings Ltd and Victorian Steel
Fabricators Pty Ltd are now doing much
better.
In the last year to August, the com-
pany lifted earning rate from 11.7 p.c.
to 17.3 p.c. It appears that Gollin could
conceivably lift earning rate for 1963-
64 closer to the 19.1 p.c. rate which
was achieved in 1960. In this event
a purchase now would show an earnings
yield approaching 10 p.c., which is very
attractive for such a well established
company with solid reserves.
Spreading the Super
/General Fertilizers Ltd has found
i'* a big brother, and ACF and Shir-
leys Fertilizers Ltd has found another
avenue for investment.
ACF and Shirleys bought a 50 p.c.
interest in General Fertilizers recently,
for an undisclosed consideration.
General, arranging to have its shares
listed in Brisbane, felt the need of an
association v/ith a well-established or-
ganisation.
ACF is itself half-owned by Austra-
lian Fertilizers Ltd, which in turn had
Cuming Smith, Mount Lyell, EZ Indus-
tries and ICIANZ as its big brothers.
A £3+ million synthetic ammonia
plant is being built at Pinkenba by Am-
monia Co. of Queensland, in which ACF
land ICIANZ are 45 p.c.-55 p.c. part-
ners. ACF has to contribute £1 million
over the next two or three years in
equity capital for this venture, so it is
currently raising £1,320,156 by a three-
for-four issue of 20s. shares at ss. pre-
mium. The surplus may have been
sufficient to cover the General Fertili-
zers purchase.
ACF shares are so scarce that in-
vestors pushed the price of the rights
to a point where there was no margin
between the cost of old and new shares,
although the old carry entitlement to
Is. 8.4 d. (Bi~ p.c.) per share dividend
(made in one payment).
The rights have been about 7s. higher
than the theoretical value of 355. sd.
based on the price prior to the issue
announcement.
Any investor seeking representation
in the fertilisers field might wait for
General Fertilizers’ flotation, particularly
if he lives in Queensland. The imme-
diate returns from others in the industry
are infinitesimal in this present strong
market.

Building Bricks
*T%e investment allowance on new
A plant purchases has again saved
Brick Industries Ltd, Melbourne, from
full tax liability in the year to March 31,
1964 probably to the tune of
£40,000 as in 1962-63.
The company was therefore able to
lift net profit from £262,700 to
£356,504. Tax provision is £164,441,
compared with £107,252 in 1963 and
£145,703 in 1962.
Depreciation charge has increased
enormously it was only £14,295 in
1960, then £145,352 in 1963, and
£164,441 in 1964.
Acquisition of New Gamble Brick
and Quarrying, Commonwealth Pottery
Pty, and Northcote Brick Co. Ltd has
projected Brick Industries from a rela-
tively small business with capital of
£201,531 in 1960 to £1,983,200 now
it is in the big time. (Premium and
bonus issues also swelled that capital.)
Earning rate in the latest year, when
the June, 1962, cash and bonus issue
ranked fully for the first time, eased
from 20 to 18 p.c. The 12i p.c. divi-
dend is held comfortably.
Present price of 12s. for the ss. units
almost doubles the 1963 low-point of
6s. sd. but still offers a moderate yield
of 5.2 p.c. and growth prospects. The
company has about four times the pro-
ductive capacity of face bricks as its
nearest Victorian competitor. It also
has a good leg in the South Australian
market through its association with
J. Hallet and Son Ltd.
Easy for Gibson anti Howes
T'he boom in sugar even surprises
those in the game. Gibson and
Howes Ltd, with a mill at Bingera, near
Bundaberg, has held the 15 p.c. dividend
on a capital increase by a one-for-three
bonus.
The profit leapt 131 p.c. from a
previous best of £154,942 in 1962 to
£355,501 ip 1963, year to December.
The earning rate was 34.1 p.c.—roughly
double what had been ruling up to and
including 1961.
When the bonus was handed out in
December last, directors said the new
shares ranked for the interim 6 p.c.
They expected to maintain a 12 p.c.
annual rate on the higher capital. Sugar
prices have been so good, however, that
a final 9 p.c. was distributed.
The company very wisely took ad-
vantage of the big premium on its shares
in August, 1963, to buy Batser Bros
Pty Ltd, which runs four sheep and
cattle properties in the Charleville dis-
trict. Renamed Gowrie Pastoral Pty,
it earned £30,856 in the 18 months to
December 31 and a capital profit of
£10,835.
Gibson and Howes does not seem to
have taken the opportunity to install new
plant, thus qualifying for an investment
allowance from the tax authorities. Tax
provision of £250,000 is about what
would be expected from the pre-tax
profit of £605,501.
A yield of 4.3 p.c. is immediately
obtainable from a purchase of Gibson
and Howes 20s. shares at around 70s.
Astor Breaks the Thread
Tf Astor Consolidated Mills Ltd fails
to turn in a satisfactory profit for
the year to June and pay the usual
10 p.c. dividend, shareholders of Astor
and the UK company Emu Wool Indus-
tries Ltd should ask some searching
questions.
Emu Wool bought a half-share interest
(at 4s. for each 2s. share) in January.
In mid-January Astor directors declared

had an identical directorate) that in
their opinion the Astor business had
been satisfactorily maintained. They
added there were no unusual factors
affecting the Astor profits since the
previous balance date, June 30, 1963.
Directors of Processing had in the same
takeover report, dated January 17, 1964,
drawn attention to the fact that Astor
had an unbroken dividend record for
the last 10 years.
Now the company reports that a
loss was incurred in the half-year to
December 31, due to the low level of
production and sales. Nor would an
interim dividend be paid.
The contradictory reports leave inves-
tors unable to make an assessment of
the company’s future prospects.
Sale of the thread-making subsidiary
a year ago and subsequent return of 3s.
capital on each ss. share had made any
predictions about the earning capacity
of the Astor worsted spinning business
difficult enough.
QUF Goes to Sea
Queensland United Foods Ltd,
which was not particularly flush
with funds at last balance date, June 30,
has apparently paid cash for the seafood
businesses of D. C. Markwell and Co.
Pty Ltd and Australian Seafoods Distri-
buting Co. Pty Ltd.
The takeover was made at the instiga-
tion of those companies, which process
prawns and fish at Tweed Heads and
have receiving depots at Southport and
Tin Can Bay. The export market is
sizeable and growing.
The nearest QUF had got to fish
previously was distribution of some
frozen fish products of Edgells and Hy-
Peak, and fishing lines and rods.
The company is pursuing a policy of
diversification as profit margins on milk
■ —the major product—are unfavorable,
according to directors' interim statement
last February.
Because of the inroads made on the
Australian food industry from USA and
the UK, QUF shares demand investment
respect. The ss. shares currently return
3.8 p.c. on income and 5.6 p.c. on earn-
ings at a price of 14s. 3d.
Constructor Watches Liquidity
Tf James Wallace (Holdings) Ltd,
A Sydney builder and civil engineer,
does no better in the second half of the
current year than in the first, profit may
be around £90,000, compared with
£140,990 in 1962-63.
Earning rate in the December six
months slumped to an annual rate of
13.6 p.c. This is a sorry fall from the
21.4 p.c. achieved in 1963, and 28 p.c.
in 1962 when absolute profit was at its
peak.
Interim dividend of 3 p.c. and pro-
bably a final 6 p.c. (hinted by the
board) will compare with 12 p.c. paid
for each of the last three years.
Directors explained that no major
construction projects were finished dur-
ing the half-year.
Shareholders can appreciate the point
about preserving liquidity while expand-
ing in the developing and profitable New
Zealand construction market (Wallace
has a £2 million contract with Auckland
City Council). Nonetheless they must
have been dismayed at the sorry turn
in company fortunes.
Shares, which were selling as high as
1 Is. 9d. earlier this year, stood at 7s. 6d.
immediately prior to the interim report.
They slumped to 6s. the next day, with
subsequent rallies to around 7s.
Something of a 810w r
T>arrett Burston, Melbourne-based
maltster, provided a pleasant sur-
prise for shareholders last week by an-
nouncing a higher profit and dividend
for the year to April 30. It would have
been something of a blow, however, to
those who sold out around this time
last year after the directors indicated
that the high export sales, which had
lifted the 1962-63 result to a new record,
would not be maintained during 1963-64.
They said at the time that 1962-63’s
success followed substantial turnover in-
creases, due to the high export orders
which enabled all malting units to pro-
duce at full capacity. Their predictions
of lower exports in 1963-64 were appa-
rently confirmed last November by the
interim report, which announced
“slightly lower” sales and profits. The
natural assumption was that the exports
had dropped as forecast.
But last week’s preliminary results
completely squashed this assumption.
The unbroken trend of increased profits
and earnings, which has prevailed since
listing in 1958, continued, reaching
£336,000 to equal 26.9 p.c. on capital,
and dividend was raised (for the fourth
year in succession) to 12+ p.c. Con-
trary to their opinions at this time last
year, the directors said that exports had
been “fully maintained” during the
year.
Moreover, they stated that exports in
1964-65 were expected to be “main-
tained”. It is to be sincerely hoped
that this prediction does not prove in-
correct also. If it does, it is up to the
board to advise the Stock Exchange
immediately.
Doubts on VIA Dividend
Melbourne-based manufacturing
engineer and office equipment
maker, VIA Ltd., has made a wise move
in omitting the interim dividend, al-
though the shares and shareholders will
suffer. Last year’s full 7 p.c. payout
(the first since 1960) was only barely
covered by the earnings, which improved
from 1.7 to 7.2 p.c.
Although the interim report mentions
a 7 p.c. turnover increase in the six
months to March 31, profitability is left
unindicated except for the directors’
statement that no subsidiary made a loss.
The logical thought from these facts is
that what profitability does exist is very
low. However, shareholders can take
heart from the fact that the dividend has
not been “omitted” in the true sense of
the word, but merely deferred until the
full accounts are available.
Despite this mere deferment, the
outlook for the current year does not
look very good from a dividend point of
view. The board claims that the dividend
has been passed to maintain liquidity,
necessary in view of the rising turnover.
This indicates a lack of working capital.
Bunny Brightens Up
TJunny Industries has removed the
reputation its shares held as one of
the dullest ordinary issues on the Mel-
bourne Stock Exchange. Directors
have announced that a one-for-two pre-
mium issue will be made the first
since listing in 1955. The company
operates as a builders’ supplier and a
steel and hardware merchant.
During its listed history, the only
really “exciting” period was early in
1959 when investors were waiting to
see if the small loss of 1958 would be
converted to a profit. The company
was successful in doing this and, since
then, progress has been dull but profit-
able. Capital has been steady since
1955, not even seeing an increase from
an acquisition or the like.
The new issue will raise £65,000 and
increase paid capital from £lOO,OOO to
£150,000. The board predicts that last
year’s 9 p.c. dividend will be maintain-
ed on the new figure. Maintenance of
the earning rate will be rather more
difficult, however.

Dunlop Rubber’s Rising Market Status
Growth and proved stability make present return attractive
By ROGER RANDERSON
T|uni.op Rubber Australia Limited,
now in its sixty-fifth year of opera-
tions, is a great group of companies
with capital of £15,475,413, which has
15,200 local shareholders and gives em-
ployment to 12,500 Australians.
Investors seem to be revising their re-
cent opinions about the quality of Dun-
lop shares, as they mark them up to
accord more with the status of a Stock
Exchange leader.
Questions are raised as to the correct
method of valuing the shares before
and after last year's one-for-four bonus
issue made concurrently with a one-for-
three par issue.
However, with the ordinary £1 share
priced at 51s. 6d., satisfactory dividend
and earning yields can be estimated from
the recent informative half-yearly report,
which also reveals that sales are con-
tinuing to increase at an impressive rate.
Dunlop has maintained its pre-
eminence in many fields since the days
when it pioneered the local manufacture
of pneumatic tyres (1903), tennis balls
(1908) and golf balls (1932).
While the company is one of the chief
suppliers of tyres and the most import-
ant supplier of batteries to the transport
industry, diversification in recent years
has given it a remarkable range of other
products.
This helps to explain why Dunlop ex-
perienced a negligible set-back in
1960-61 from the official measures, even
though they were largely directed to-
wards checking the motor industry.
Few investors in recent years attached
sufficient weight to large sales of foot-
wear and garments, vinyl floorings and
furnishings including '‘Dunlopillo” mat-
tresses, besides almost every conceivable
kind of sporting gear, nor to the revenue
derived from supplying rubber and plas-
tic equipment to other industries, the
equipping of aircraft and guided missiles
and many servicing activities.
lyfucH of the comany’s real expansion
in the post-war period went unper-
ceived, because it retained a large surplus
of earnings after payment of dividends,
allotted shares direct to acquire valu-
able properties, and, until recently, was
sparing with its issues.
Shareholders were invited to sub-
scribe £1,412,121 to a one-for-four issue
at 30s. in 1950. This was the first issue
to them since the ’twenties.
Two years later (in 1952) sharehold-
ers were invited to subscribe a further
£1,901,250 to a one-for-four issue at
275. 6d.
Ordinary dividend, which had been
stationary at 8 p.c. for 1946-47 and fol-
lowing years, was increased to 8i- p.c.
for 1953-54, to 9 p.c. for 1955-56, to
91 p.c. for 1956-57 and to 10 p.c. for
1957-58 and following years.
Shareholders in October, 1959, were
allotted £1,188,997 shares in a one-for-
six bonus issue, made possible by capitali-
sation of share premiums and a slight
surplus from revaluation of assets.
This was an unqualified bonus issue,
because the previous 10 p.c. dividend
continued to be paid on shareholdings
increased by a sixth.
Nevertheless, Dunlop’s £1 ordinary
share touched low points of 345. 3d. in
1961 and of 365. 9d. in 1962.
\l/'ith last year’s announcement of the
” concurrent bonus and par issues, the
share moved temporarily to the 1963
high point of 60s. 3d.
Directors, however, indicated at the
time that the company expected to pay
only 8 p.c. on its greatly increased capi-
tal, compared with the previous 10 p.c.
rate.
This took some, although not all, of
the gilt off the gingerbread. Investors,
therefore, allowed the share, after it had
shed its rights, to fall to the 1963 low
point of 395. 9d.
Subsequent marked recovery has
brought the share to its present price of
about 51s. 6d., which is near the 1962
high point.
The present price is equivalent to
having paid 755. for the share when
rights to the bonus and par issues were
attached to it last year, which is about
a fifth higher than the peak price of
60s. 3d. actually paid while it was in
this pregnant condition.
And the question to be decided is
whether Dunlops are now too dear, or
whether the market has merely corrected
a previous error in undervaluing the
shares when last year’s issues were
announced.
Scope for last year's bonus issue was
found by creating a reserve of
£2,296,644 from the revaluation of cer-
tain freeholds and then capitalising the
reserve, so that the next balance sheet
should not show any reduction of the
amount of reserves shown in the table
below.
Nevertheless, the company’s reserves
are at present smaller relatively to ordi-
nary capital, because of the par as well
as the bonus issue, which, together, have
increased ordinary capital in the current
year by £5,358,836, or more than half
of its previous amount.
VTet tangible assets backing for each
ordinary £1 share would now, on my
rough reckoning, be slightly above 305.,
compared with 41s. 7d. as determined on
the last balance sheet.
Similarly, one should expect such
issues, without a countervailing increase
in profit, to have had the effect of re-
ducing the earning rate on each of the
increased number of issued shares.
These are the orthodox reasons why a
share generally should not move above its
equivalent price cum-rights until suffi-
cient time has elapsed for earning rate
and assets backing to be restored.
Naturally, it is assumed that changes
in the general level of the market have
not been sufficient to offset the dilution-
ary effect of such issues.
On the other hand, quite a number of
investors these days take the view that
they get better value by buying shares
immediately after, instead of before,
bonus issues.
They apparently follow the principle
that all companies, because they have
done it before, will soon do it again.
No doubt they are encouraged in this
by the fascinating art of projecting future
growth on the basis of past results.
In some instances this is sound enough,
but certainly not in all cases.
I find the utmost difficulty in regard-
ing Dunlop as an intrinsically better
share immediately after its assets back-
ing and earning rate have both been
reduced.
But I do accept the possibility that
the market previously underestimated
its real worth and long-term potentialities,
by setting the cum-rights price too low,
and is now making a more realistic
assessment.
The announcement in February that
an interim dividend of 10.8 d. per share
(4i p.c.) would be paid in April was a
bull point for the market.
The unchanged interim, since it is the
same as in previous years (when fol-
lowed by a final payment of higher
amount), has been taken to mean: that
directors no longer find it necessary to
reduce the full 1963-64 dividend to-
-8 p.c.; that this year's dividend will be

not less than 9 p.c.; and that It may
possibly remain at the 10 p.c. paid since
1957-58.
Dividend yield at the present price will
therefore be 3.5 and possibly 3.9 p.c.
which compares favorably with the re-
turn from similar leading investments.
A circular sent to shareholders in April
gave even greater encouragement to being
optimistic about the company’s long-
term prospects.
Directors revealed in the circular that
sales turnover during the half-year ended
December 31 amounted to £44,032,718,
which was 5.6 p.c. higher than for the
corresponding first half of 1962-63.
Sales figures given below are a reli-
able indication of the group’s uninter-
rupted and “continued excellent pro-
gress”, especially when faced with in-
creased competition from new tyre
manufacturers in recent years:
£ million
1956 40
1957 45
1958 51
1959 57
1960 64
1961 65
1962 71
1963 81
1964 88 (Est.)
Directors also revealed a marked in-
crease in profit for the first half of the
current year the six months ended
December 31.
Net profit at £1,316,782 was
£153,844 higher than it had been for
the first half of 1962-63, after charging
£676,870 (or £31,480 more) for de-
preciation, and providing £868,340 (or
£91,520 more) for taxation, the figures
being subject to audit.
It is estimated that the current earning
rate on increased ordinary capital will
be about Yl\ p.c. if these results are
reproduced in the second half of 1963-
64.
Thus, despite the expected 13 p.c.
increase in profit, there will be a reduc-
tion from last year’s earning rate on
lower capital of 23.1 p.c.
Earnings yield from a purchase of the
shares at 51s. 6d., nevertheless, will be
6.8 p.c., which is relatively high con-
sidering the quality of the investment.
Far from regarding Dunlop as too
dear at present, I consider the share is
suitable for inclusion in the best port-
folios. It must have been undervalued
last year, before sufficient information
became available to enable the company’s
tough stability and capacity for continu-
ous growth to be fully recognised.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
PGH Industries Analysed
Are shares still good buying or over-priced?
Approximately eighteen months ago,
prior to the last rights issue, I sug-
gested that PGH Industries Ltd shares
(ex rights) would be sound buying up
to 19s. 6d. At that time they were
around 16s. 6d. and an 18 p.c. increase
in price may have seemed rather sub-
stantial. In fact, they fell as low as
16s. during March, 1963.
No upward trend was discernible until
the third quarter of 1963 but the upward
movement continued until the end of the
year carrying the price to 21s. 6d. This
was followed by a rapid rise in one week
when the shares reached 245., and since
then they have varied between 225. 9d.
and 235. 9d.
This puts the shares about Is. above
the maximum price which I estimated
for them in late 1962. The question
must then be “Are they still good buying
or are they over-priced?”
It may be as well to trace some of
the events which ha\e occurred since the
end of 1962.
In March, 1963, it was announced that
a modern ceramics factory to produce
bricks and pipes would be built on an
84-acre site at Golden Grove, 15 miles
from Adelaide. This project was not
begun until the last quarter of 1963 and
is not expected to come into production
until next month.
In July, 1963, PGH sponsored a
Malaysian company to manufacture
bricks, pipes and tiles at Jurong, near
Singapore. PGH will hold 40 p.c. of
the equity capital in this company.
In November, 1963, PGH in associa-
tion with Kauri Holdings announced
their intention to purchase Brown &
Broad Ltd, of Brisbane, from Hancock
& Gore, and this purchase was com-
pleted during the month.
At the end of January, 1964, Douglas
Wrigley and Co. Ltd, of New Zealand,
distributor of “Alcon” aluminium damp-
course manufactured by PGH was ac-
quired with an issue of 40,000 PGH
shares.
Just recently it was announced that
Esso Standard Oil (Aust.) Ltd would
purchase from PGH the Allen Bros
group of companies which is engaged in
road surfacing.
The general effect of these moves
seems to be that PGH is extending its
interests in the ceramic and timber fields
and on a geographical basis is expanding
in Queensland and South Australia. The
following figures show the trends in
home building commencements in three
States where PGH is perhaps most
active:—
Index 1959=100
Year to NSW Q!d SA Aust.
Dec., 1961 102 104 96 94
Dec., 1962 102 104 108 102
Sept., 1963 106 107 118 108
Dec., 1963 108 109 122 112
March, 1964 116 119 130 119
On the basis of these figures, it
would seem that the SA venture should
pay off.
The impression could also be gained
that PGH has funds tied up which are not
yet income producing, both in SA and
Singapore at least. Further, the chair-
man said last November: “Some pro-
perties which have been acquired through
takeovers are regarded as surplus and
will be sold just as soon as favorable
opportunities occur.”
Nevertheless, the percentage of net
profit before tax, depreciation and
interest on long-term debt to net work-
ing capital plus fixed assets and invest-
ments has been as follows:
Year to
June 30 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
26.5 23.2 20.8 22.8 23.9
The rising trend since 1961 is very
evident.
While on the subject of profit, etc., the
following table (which was included in
the last article until June, 1962) is of
interest:—
Index Year to June 1959=100

June, 63 241 272 265 307
Sept., 63 283 261 307
Dec., 63 296 281 307
As suggested in the previous article,
profit continued to increase until it had
overtaken the increase in ordinary capi-
tal and then ordinary capital was increas-
ed (by a rights issue to shareholders).
From then on profits have continued
their upward trend but up to December,
1963, they had not yet overtaken the
increase in capital.
However, when the next quarterly
statement is issued probably
in a few days—it could well be that
profit will have come close to the capi-
tal increase.
The impression is created of well-con-
sidered and well-controlled expansion
and ordinary shareholders can feel
reasonably confident that their interest
in the business is not being watered
down by issues of capital to other than
existing shareholders.
While full details of the deal with
Esso are not yet available, it must be
assumed that this will improve the liquid
funds position and further demands
upon shareholders are not likely to be
made in the near future.
Looking at past trends in adjusted
earnings and dividends per share (see
schedule), there has been a tendency
over the last five years for earnings to
edge upwards despite the difficult con-
ditions of 1961 and 1962. Dividends
have increased steadily at an average
rate of about 44 p.c. per annum and
as earnings were running at the level of
14.55 pence (1.21 shillings) per share
at December, 1963, the lOd. dividend is
clearly well covered and with further
earnings to come from projects not yet
income producing one could expect an
increase in per share earnings not only
for the current fiscal year but again in
1964-65.
Providing that this increased “pros-
perity” is passed on to the shareholders
in the form of increased dividend in-
come, whether by an increase in the
dividend rate or by new issues, the
shares cannot be said to be over-priced
at current levels.
In his last annual address the chair-
man also said: “Much of our freehold
land is still valued at its original pur-
chase cost and thus represents a good
reserve for development at a later stage.”
Some of those investors who read chair-
men's addresses may have taken this to
mean that a bonus issue was possible in
due time, and this may have accounted
for the 2s. 6d. increase in price referred
to at the beginning of this article.

The “Whys” of the Premium Issue
A nervous market cuts prices
A fall of Is. 6d. from 11s. 3d. on the
day a one-for-two premium issue is
announced is an unusual reaction; yet
this was the case with Sydney retailer
Marcus Clark and Co. Ltd. It therefore
deserves closer inspection.
The issue is to “provide permanent
capital for the company as it nears com-
pletion of its development programme
and replace short-term deposits”.
As loans and short-term deposits had
been extended from £592,610 to
£1,268,000 at August 3, 1963, and long-
term liabilities of various kinds totalled
£3,996,746, compared with preference
capital of £597,848 and ordinary capital
£753,645, the share issue (at 2s. premium
on ss. units) seems a very sensible plan.
What makes the market a little
nervous is the interim report issued two
or three weeks before the share issue
announcement, when directors forecast
that 1963-64 profit would not be as great
as in 1962-63.
In the half-year to February 1, 1964,
sales rose 17.4 p.c. to a record £5.4
million. Gross profit margins were main-
tained, but net profit was below the
previous corresponding period.
Contributors to this declining profit
were expenses of centralising and in-
tegrating NSW activities, abnormal bad
debts, expenses of rebuilding and re-
organising the Newcastle store and open-
ing the new Tamworth store last Novem-
ber, and the disruption of business in
Adelaide with major building operations.
Directors declared that the com-
pany’s four-year plan of reorganisation
and development would be basically
completed for Christmas trading in
1964, and that this current year would
be affected more than any other by
related costs and bad debts, with 1965
affected to a much less degree.
They forecast that 1966 would see the
company showing its true earning
capacity.
In the share issue announcements,
shareholders were told that directors ex-
pected the 10 p.c. dividend to be held
on capital increased by the issue and by
the conversion of notes on January 31,
1965.
Capital next January will be
£1,785,875, so the dividend obligation
in a full year will be £178,588 plus the
preference charges of £37,360, a total
of £182,323, compared with last year’s
profit of £141,168.
The 2,317,166 ss. shares now being
issued will not rank for any dividend in
respect of 1963-64 profits, but, of course,
will rank fully next year, and the ex-
notes shares will rank for next year’s
final dividend.
Investors thus realise that the shares
had been over-priced in relation to the
present and immediate future prospects.
The shares are now priced at Bs. to
yield 6.2 p.c.
The major store is at Railway Square,
Sydney, covering 233,000 square feet.
It achieved record sales in 1962-63. The
Newcastle store is being reconstructed so
that it will have 80,000 square feet of
fully air-conditioned space. A new store
was opened in March, 1963, in the
Monaro Mall, Canberra, and there are
older stores at Wollongong, Dubbo,
Orange, Tamworth, Inverell, Lithgow
and West Ryde.
A subsidiary, Bon Marche Ltd, runs
a new store at Liverpool (NSW) which
had bad debts of £42,150 in 1962-63.
Another subsidiary, Hobsons Pty Ltd,
runs stores at North Sydney and St Ives.
The Oxford Furnishing Co. Pty runs
furniture stores at Wagga and Tumut,
and Wilga Productions makes bedding
and furniture.
The Sydney Cold Stores Ltd was taken
over late in 1961. It still provides cold
storage facilities, and part of its property
has been converted to a carpark for
customers of the Railway Square store.
Miller Anderson Ltd is 62 p.c. owned
by Marcus Clark. It operates a store in
Adelaide which is now being completely
modernised and air-conditioned. Selling
space is being increased to 32,000 square
feet, a carpark provided to handle 2000
cars a day, and a new arcade opened.


This will cost £750,000. There are three
branch stores at Clare, Naracoorte and
Brighton in SA.
There is a finance subsidiary which
finances mainly the long-term credit sales
of the group’s retail stores from 12
months to four years.
The group has a large mail order
business supplementing its direct retail
outlets. A team of 200 outdoor collector-
salesmen was completely reorganised
during 1962-63.
This reorganisation, plus a write-off of
£102,216 bad debts (£53,771 in 1961-
62), pre-opening expenses of the Can-
berra store and other developmental ex-
penditure, contributed to the fall in
profit from the record of £195,896 to
£141,168 in the last year to August 3.
The substantial rise in debtors (par-
ticularly in the last financial year), com-
pared w'ith the trend of stocks and sales,
could be a source of further difficulties.

HOWARD SMITH LTD
Not All Done on Sugar
Although the net trading profit of
Howard Smith Ltd rose from
£388,381 to £675,151 in the year to
December 31, 1963, the results do not
fully reflect the boom in the sugar
industry because the subsidiary, Aus-
tralian Sugar Co. Pty Ltd, balances at
June 30.
The shipping business and ancillary
activities, the colliery, engineering sub-
sidiaries and general investments all con-
tributed to the increased group earnings.
Earning rate is a respectable 16.1
p.c. on capital increased by a one-for-
five bonus. The new shares ranked
for the full year's dividend of 10 p.c.
In 1962 and 1961 the earning rate was
only 10.1 p.c. In 1960 the rate of
7 p.c. failed to cover the then 8 p.c.
dividend.
The present quite remarkable show
of strength w'as treated calmly by
directors generally and the chairman
(Mr W. Howard-Smith) in his latest
annual address. The company is noted
for its conservatism.
Australian Steamships Pty, which
operates a fleet of five cargo vessels
on the coastal run and five tugs in Port
Melbourne, operates as a base for
agency business and stevedoring. The
new tug You Yangs had an appre-
ciably beneficial effect on earnings. The
Tooronga will be replaced early in
1965.
This subsidiary did not submit a divi-
dend to the parent in 1963, although
its better earnings influenced the group
result.
Melbourne Steamship Co. Ltd re-
turned reasonable profits in 1963, the
chairman said. Most of its activities
have been transferred to the parent or
other subsidiaries since it was acquired
in 1961.
Apart from the prospect of higher
sugar prices, shareholders in Howard
Smith can gloat on the thought of what
increased plantings in 1963 will do for
Australian Sugar Co.’s results in 1965.
The company operates a mill at Mouril-
yan in North Queensland and is wisely
concentrating on improving its effici-
ency, since high prices on the free
market cannot last indefinitely.
The Invincible Colliery Ltd is owned
65 p.c. by Howard Smith and mines
coal at Cullen Bullen on the western
coalfields. As it has been losing busi-
ness in recent years because of the
growing dieselisation of NSW Railways,
the company is depending on renew-
ing a contract with the State Electricity
Commission.
Engineers in the group are Hobson’s
Bay Dock and Engineering Co. Pty at
Williamstown (Vic.), Hodge Engineer-
ing Co. Pty at Sydney, and Cockburn
Engineering Pty at Fremantle — con-
ducting marine and general engineering
in the three ports.
General investments include large
shareholdings in BHP, Southern Port-
land Cement, Coal and Allied Indus-
tries, A. Goninan, Mt Isa, and a 7 p.c.
interest in Bulkships Pty Ltd. Invest-
ments are shown in the 1963 balance
sheet as Commonwealth Loans £65,000,
shares and debentures in listed com-
panies £3,899,095, and shares and de-
bentures in other companies £746,041.
Listed stocks had a market value at
balance date of £6,715,601, which
gives the 20s. ordinary shares an addi-
tional 13s. lid. asset backing to the
figure of 38s. 7d. calculated on tangible,
visible assets.
In 1963 the group lost £37,176 on
the sale of fixed assets, but made a
capital profit of £17,545 on the sale
of investments.
For the four years 1959-1962 inclu-
sive, investments were sold to produce
large capital profits, distracting inves-
tors’ attention from the relatively poor
trading results. Capital profits were
made in 1959 and 1962 on the sale of
fixed assets, losses in the other three
years.
In April, 1960, the company raised
£750,000 by a one-for-four issue of
20s. shares at a 10s. premium. Simul-
taneously it made a one-for-four
bonus capitalising £500,000 of asset
revaluation reserve. These were the
first capital moves by the company since
1927.
In October, 1963, the company made
another one-for-four bonus, raising paid
ordinary capital to £4,104,550.

BRAMAC LTD
Salvation Through Takeover?
fpHE English parent company, Green-
-*• gate and Irwell Rubber Co. Ltd,
has agreed to accept 600,000 ss. shares
in Bramac Ltd as part payment for its
loan of £230,000.
In current market terms these shares
would only be worth about £82,500.
The balance of the settlement will be
made in cash at Bramac's option.
Greengate and Irwell have been very
patient, agreeing to forego interest for
the whole of 1963 on £30,000 of a
loan made during the year 1962. Bra-
mac’s trading difficulties provide the
reason.
A previous Greengate and Irwell op-
tion conferred the right to take up
920,000 ordinary shares of ss. each in
satisfaction of the loan account. This
agreement was to expire on January 1,
1964. It has now been extended until
July 1, 1964, to enable directors to
submit an amendment to the company’s
Articles of Association limiting the
voting powers of majority shareholders.
The move protects other shareholders,
and ensures compliance with listing re-
quirements of the Melbourne Stock
Exchange.
Bramac was able to pay modest divi-
dends up to 8 p.c. until 1958, when
dividend was omitted. Two 5 p.c. pay-
ments followed for 1959 and 1960.
None has been paid since.
The company makes waterproof gar-
ments and coated fabrics, as well as
conveyor and transmission belting.
Low-priced imports of conveyor belt-
ing compelled a reduction in Bramac
selling prices. Although the garments
and coated fabrics division sold higher,
competition was keen. So the profit
margins were lower.

Result of trading for the year to
December was a profit of £1537, com-
pared with £4182 in 1962 and a loss
of £32,162 in 1961. No tax has been
paid for the last five years.
Action which the company is taking
to correct the position includes mana-
gerial changes, and visits from the
English company with a view to deve-
loping the business into a wider field of
activity.
At 2s. 9d. or thereabouts the ss.
shares, traded in Melbourne and Perth,
have little to offer a prospective inves-
tor. Capital is already £432,500, and
likely to rise to £582,500 within the
next couple of months. Although the
company has revenue and capital re-
serves of £135,114, they provide little
security if profits cannot be earned.
The only solution for Australian share-
holders would be a complete takeover
by the English company.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Scavenging Around Coles’ Issue
Cashing in on those multiples of ten
Oince the beginning of the year, people
have been getting all excited about
G. J. Coles’ Golden Anniversary. Every-
one seemed to have remembered the
chairman saying that plans were now in
hand to celebrate this marvellous
occasion. It became not a question of
a bonus issue, but only how large that
bonus issue would be.
No wonder the market took it a little
to heart when the company announced a
1-for-10 premium issue, and a non-
renounceable issue at that.
At the same time, the company dis-
closed its intention of rounding off all
holdings to multiples of ten. Being a
scavenger by nature, I saw an oppor-
tunity of a small investment resulting in
a 100 p.c. profit within a couple of
months.
It would appear that if one bought five
G. J. Coles, it would in due course
be made up to ten. Details of this round-
ing-off have not yet been made public.
Even if the company insists on par value
being paid for these extra five shares,
there is still a fair profit in it. There-
fore, while G. J. Coles might be the
smallest investment in the portfolio, it
could possibly be offering the biggest
percentage gain.
The other purchases this week were
both thoughts at the back of my mind
last week.
First of all was ODE, which has
slipped still further to ss. Bd. I’m com-
pletely bewildered by this sudden fall.
At this price it offers a dividend yield
of 6 p.c. and excellent prospects of
growth. Oil shares may be down, yet
there is plenty of oil exploration activity
and it’s bound to be stepped up as time
goes on. To the existing 1000 shares in
the portfolio, I added a further 1000.
The next purchase was F. W.
Williams rights, which, incidentally, are
one of the many rights on the market
now.
If one is a student of investment
analysis, F. W. Williams is an excellent
company to select. It is a holding com-
pany that not only has subsidiaries but
also associated companies to contend
with. For those who are not quite clear
on this distinction, a 50 p.c. share interest
in another company makes that other
company an associate. If the interest is
greater than 50 p.c. it becomes a sub-
sidiary.
When consolidated accounts are drawn
up, the interest in the associated com-
pany remains as an investment and the
dividend paid by the associate to the
holding company remains the only in-
come from that source.
To understand the significance of this
situation, we find that for F. \y,
Williams the 1963 consolidated earning
rate of 16 p.c. rises to 27 p.c. if an
adjustment is made to include half the
profits of the major associate company,
St Regis-Williams Pty Ltd. Further
complicating the picture is the fact that
F. W. Williams balances on December
31, whereas St Regis-Williams Pty Ltd
balances on June 30. It is thus six
months behind the holding company’s
accounts.
St Regis-Williams’ two main interests
are Sisalkraft reinforced and laminated
papers and Bates multi-wall paper bags.
Sisalkraft is best known for its use in
building and packaging. Bates’ bags are
used for the packaging of fertilisers,
cement, lime and so on. It would seem
that the industries, in particular building,
which this company supplies have had
a very real increase in demand since
July, 1963.
Likewise the rural wholesale and retail
subsidiary and the plastic manufacturing
subsidiaries should be benefiting from
the upsurge in the economy.
The current l-for-6 issue at 12s. 6d.
premium has been received very quietly
on the market. After opening at 10s.,
the rights have settled down at 9s. a
very fair buying price.
Over the last month or so, I’ve taken
a few losses. So this week I thought I’d
reverse that state of affairs. Ansett, now
up to 95., gave me a profit of £6O, in-
cluding the dividend. In a much shorter
time, I was able to show a profit of £55
on James Hardie.
The week's transactions were:
SOLD
100 Janies Hardie, £7/10/- £741
1000 Ansett, 9/- £452
BOUGHT
1000 ODE, 5/8 £294
500 F. W. Williams rts, 9/- £231
5 G. J. Coles, 18/10 £ 5
This leaves me in debit to the tune of
£55. Like the rest of the market, the
shares in my portfolio are pretty quiet.
The bright spot is the appliance shares—
Kelvinator and Malleys.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Countering the US Cattlemen
Meat and the Washington tariff inquiry
The New Zealand Meat Producers’
1 Board deserves a pat on the back
for calling Dr Harold Breimeyer as a
witness at the US Tariff Commission
inquiry in Washington into meat im-
ports.
Dr Breimeyer, an agricultural econo-
mist on loan to the University of Illi-
nois from the US Agriculture Depart-
ment, made a most notable contribution
to the inquiry in just one sentence.
He said: “There are very few in-
exorable laws of this universe but the
rule of retaliation in trade restrictions
is one of them.”
He said much more, yet this one
sentence sums up very adequately the
best line of defence open to Australia
and New Zealand against the avowed
intention of US cattlemen's associations
to seek a 25 per cent cut back in meat
imports instead of the recently negoti-
ated six per cent.
The fact that Dr Breimeyer is an
American, and one with a high stand-
ing on the academic side of agriculture,
is very significant.
‘‘Man on the Land” contended at the
time of the “voluntary” six per cent
cut-back- agreement some months ago,
and still does, that, with a proper mus-
tering of the kind of realistic American
thinking as represented by Dr Brei-
meyer, Australia might have done bet-
ter than losing even six per cent of the
trade built up over the last six years.
It would have required, perhaps,
s °me blows below the belt. Do we
not receive such blows from the US in
the shape of restrictive tariffs on
"°°l ' n particular? And leaving aside
me matter of the American firms here
■n industries such as motor cars, and
a nminium, do we really need Ameri-
Can know how” to make biscuits,
cheese and soap?
Back to Dr Breimeyer.
He stressed that to impose restric-
lons on beef imports to America would
Jeopardise US exports of a wide variety
0 * ar m products.
This retaliation would not come
!meetly from Australia and New Zea-
but from many other countries
V 0 Were “looking over our shoulder
at this inquiry”. (This was obviously a
reference to the Kennedy Round talks
on world tariffs in Geneva and Ameri-
ca's intention, in words anyway, to
support a freeing of world, trade.)
TAr Breimeyer said there was no doubt
that the US cattle business was in
financial straits and the operators of
the feed lots used to fatten cattle were
worse off than the actual producers.
There had been much over-capitalisa-
tion of expensive feed lots which could
be used for no other purpose and there-
fore had to be kept in constant opera-
tion in the hope of eventually making a
profit.
Further, Dr Breimeyer said, he was
certain that sizeable restrictions on im-
ports of processing beef great
enough to hold the total supply per
person below previous levels would
have damaging consequences to the de-
mand for beef generally and would
eventually be detrimental to the cattle
industry.
In other words, if the people who eat
sausages and hamburgers now, either
because they like them (teenagers) or
cannot afford anything better (the un-
employed and underprivileged), are
unable to get them they will not buy
expensive steaks as substitutes. Their
eating habits will change.
Much evidence has been given by
various American witnesses on the
methods employed by the American
supermarket chains.
The cattleman in the US deserves
some sympathy. It is to be hoped that
the Australian representatives take de-
tailed notes. The same thing could
happen here with the butcher's shop
going out of existence and the house-
wife buying her meat from the deep-
freeze container.
To what extent is it fair to primary
producers for retail organisations to get
into the producing side of the meat, or
any other primary industry?
The small farmer, along with the
small butcher and the small grocer,
goes to the wall. He just cannot com-
pete with the huge producer/retailer
organisation geared to massive sales.
In one way this evidence is good for
Australia. It proves that the retailers
want the hamburgers and the sausages
made from lean Australian beef.
But it also proves that they want this
kind of meat, and expensive cuts too,
at their price. Happily we can provide
the kind of meat they want at the price
they like, though in the long-term the
growth of the producer/retailer com-
plex has grave implications for indi-
vidual farmers, be they American or
Australian.
American meat packers and pro-
cessors are also giving the kind of evi-
dence which will do us no harm at the
tariff inquiry.
Mr Marvin Gibson, head of a large
packing company, referred to cattle-
men's claims for restrictions as “an
opportunistic and double standard of
conduct”.
What is Australia's delegation doing
at the tariff inquiry?
The chairman of the Australian Meat
Board, Mr J. L. Shute, has apparently
made a good showing by dealing with
the overall trade picture.
This is clearly on the right track and
it is just a pity that in all the earlier
negotiations the question of our entry
to the market was apparently restricted
to the narrow sphere of the meat pro-
ducts themselves.
Mr Shute told the inquiry that Aus-
tralia’s status as a world trading power,
and its ability to buy American goods,
depended partly on maintaining her
meat exports to America.
He submitted figures showing that in
the financial year ended June 30 last
Australia brought US goods valude at 515
million dollars, and in return sold only
298 million dollars of goods to the US.
He also made the good point that
Australia receives no foreign aid from
the US, which may sound trivial
except for the rather incredible belief of
a good many Americans that we are on
the receiving end of their foreign aid.
11/Tr Shute brought up the matter of
T” “the friendly ally in the Pacific”, the
fact that the Australian beef industry
operated “under the rules of free enter-
prise”, and that we had shown, by our
voluntary agreement, we had a “genuine
desire not to damage the US beef
industry”.
Talk around the sale rings this week,
for what it is worth, is that the US
cattlemen will win a bounty from their
Government for producing beef.
Such gossip is not always idle, as
many of the buyers here are in contact
with shippers who are in contact with
the receivers in the US.
It would appear to make sense. The
US can hardly say one thing in Geneva
and do exactly the opposite in Washing-
ton.


Moreover, the US cattle industry is
unique in that it is almost the sole
American farming segment which gets
no government aid of any kind.
You can get a farm subsidy for not
planting cotton or corn, but you cannot
get paid for not rearing cattle. That
was a decision of the US cattlemen
themselves.
They could have had their share of
the huge US farm subsidy but they
voted against it in order to maintain
their independence.
Much of their more outspoken criti-
cism of the effect of our imports may
be therefore psychological.
They know that they may have got
their business into a mess. They know
that the imports of lean meat are not
really the cause. But, being human,
they will not be willing to admit it.
Their pride in their independence is
understandable.
The lone cowboy of the prairie has,
in fact, long ago gone into rodeo and
show business. The legend may be
finally due to disappear also.
A “Kangaroo” in Britain
One promotion campaign that has paid off
Tt is six months since the Australian
Dairy Produce Board entered the
packaging business in the United King-
dom by launching a butter called
“Kangaroo”. In that time there have
been numerous jokes about the brand,
especially from rival New Zealanders,
who like to point out that their butter
comes from cows.
There has been some confusion, too.
The British Broadcasting Corporation’s
second television channel, which came
into operation a few weeks ago, has
also taken the kangaroo as its symbol,
and when a big London retail store
featured “Kangaroo” butter for a Com-
monwealth Week that it was running,
customers demanded to know why such
a fuss was being made of the new
channel.
Despite this, and although, in the
words of another big London retailer,
“Kangaroo butter is not setting the
world on fire”, there is clearly more to
be said for than against it.
According to the London manager
of the Australian Dairy Produce Board,
Mr R. E. Moore, “Kangaroo” is fourth
in sales among the 600-odd brands of
butter in the United Kingdom. It is
responsible for raising the quantity of
Australian branded butter on this mar-
ket from 300 to 500 tons a week, and
in the London area the best for
Australian butter it has lifted Aus-
tralian packaged butter from three to
10 per cent of the total trade.
One of the difficulties for an Austra-
lian trying to assess the worth of the
new brand is his aversion to the name.
It seems to belong with the commerci-
alised version of the slouch hat, and
with “Jackeroo” and “Emu” wines —-
the latter of which, incidentally, was on
show last week a few feet from the
“Kangaroo butter, making that part
of the store quite like an Australian wild-
life reserve.
But the Australian Dairy Produce
Board, in its wisdom, w'as not trying to
please Australians with the choice of
name, and its officers are a bit touchy
when they are asked about the wise-
cracks. Growled one: “What about
New Zealand's ‘Anchor’ butter? Does
it come from under the sea?”
According to officials, the aim in
choosing a brand was to establish a
quick association with the country of
origin something that has for too
long been overlooked. “Kangaroo”
seemed well qualified to do it.
Although most Australians don’t
know it, the term “Kangaroo” has been
used in the UK for 40 years to denote
choicest butter and cheese to commerce
inspectors and merchants. So at least
within the trade it would need no intro-
duction as a quality symbol.
''Kangaroo' 5 had also been registered
as a trademark by the Commonwealth
of Australia since 1 925, but the Govern-
ment agreed to let the Board have it.
Finally, the kangaroo had been used for
years as a symbol for Australian publi-
city in general, in fields extending even
to tourism.
So the kangaroo stood out as a ready-
made mascot for the new brand.
The brand was launched last year
and is now in 150,000 British shops
about half privately owned and the
rest in chains and co-operatives. In the
south of the country “Kangaroo” is in
almost every big grocery group.
authorities admit that they
were lucky to have brought “Kan-
garoo ’ on to the British market at the
depth of the biggest dairying failure Eur-
ope had had for years when demand for
extra supplies amounted almost to emer-
gency proportions. Since then, condi-
tions have remained equally propitious
for the brand.
The big thing about this is that when
equilibrium returns to the market there
will be a big proportion of “stick”, or
residual loyalty, by British consumers
to a brand they came by almost acci-
dentally.
In the immediate sense, “Kangaroo”
has been a boon for Australian dairying.
Despite the enlarged UK quota of
75,000 tons, which swallowed at one
gulp a surplus that was whitening the
hair of the industry’s top brass, prices
not only remained firm but finished 3d.
to 6d. a lb. higher for the year than in
the previous 12 months, and consump-
tion at the same time showed no sign
of waning.
In addition to having calamity on its
side, ‘"Kangaroo” was ushered into a
market conditioned by Britain’s mount-
ing prosperity, the growth of its popu-
lation, advertising by the Butter Promo-
tion Council — an organisation through
which the UK, Eire, Australia, New
Zealand, Denmark, Finland, Sweden,
Norway and Austria spend £500,000 a
year on making butter and cheese more
popular — and Australia’s own expen-
diture of £120,000 sterling a year on
national butter and cheese promotion,
a sum drawn equally from the industry
and the Commonwealth.
Dairy Produce Board does not want
“Kangaroo” to cut into the mar-
kets of established brands or to bring
them all within the one wrapper. The
brand is meant to give identity to a lot
of Australian butter that has hitherto
remained a commercial orphan, sneak-
ing anonymously on to British plates in
blends or under another country’s flag.
The actual launching of “Kangaroo”
took place amid quite a cafoofle, even
for this country. In the first fortnight,
£40,000 was spent in London and the
south of England on 52 15-second tele-
vision spots and a color page in the
biggest evening newspaper.
The catchline, “Best Bread Butter”,
which was used with the advertising,
irritated some Australians and mystified
others. They asked: “What other kind
of butter is there?” But the. Board
knew what it was doing. The phrase
was a play on the word “bred”. More-
over, out of it came an offer to link
up in a publicity campaign with the
large bread firm of “Hovis” — a union
that gave “Kangaroo” 50 per cent more
time on London television for a month.
On the outskirts of the launching
campaign w r ere the bands of uniformed
Australian girls who have become a
familiar part of trade promotion in this
country, some confronting the public at
displays, others being briefed for the
more responsible task of carrying the
message to retailers.
Having launched the brand, if n ot
with brilliance at least with a satisfac-
tory glow, the Board’s representatives
and the Australian trade officials who
help them are not relaxing much. They
are putting their energies into trying to
lift the tonnage of identified Australian
butter on this market by a further 100
tons a week next year.

Tempting Those Flavor Buds
A market for taste as well as packages
An English housewife is reported to
be starting a campaign to “free
the animals in cages throughout the
world”.
She means animals in zoos. On this
score she will probably get support,
although it has yet to be proved that
animals in zoos are any worse off, or
less happy, than animals fighting for
their existence in the jungle.
She also means laying hens in cages,
vealer calves in pens, and porkers in
“concrete cells”.
All these animals, she says, should be
allowed to roam free “as God made
them”.
Such a programme would throw pri-
mary industry in all the advanced
countries into confusion and disarray.
Chaos would be a mild way of describ-
ing the outcome.
Yet, peculiarly enough, some of the
animals now kept in rather strict con-
finement may get more room to flex
their muscles and move their legs in
the future.
The reason is that in Europe and in
Britain there are signs that flavor, as a
marketable commodity, may come back
into its own.
Are the eggs laid by the hens in lay-
ing cages any less flavorsome than the
ones we used to buy years ago?
Is the deep frozen broiler, usually
reared in confinement, really a bit
tasteless?
Is the similarly deep frozen and
packaged steak chunky as it is
missing in something when you cook it?
These questions have not been
answered, but, in the constant drive to
expand markets, some experts have
come to the conclusion that perhaps
they have paid too much attention to
Packaging, display, and identification.
This line of thought started in Bri-
tain about a year ago as a direct re-
SLI,t of the tremendous increase in
barley beef.
Feed lots, on the American pattern,
"ere set up. In America they feed
Corn (i.e., Indian maize) along with
special processed stockfeeds based on
corn. It was thought that barley would
e just as good, if not better.
as a stockfeed for cattle in
. a feed lot, has many advantages. It
& lv es all the proteins necessary and
cattle can absorb it without digestive
troubles.
o it is cheaper than other
e r ains. New strains have been deve-
°Ped which give higher yields per acre.
Cattle love the stuff and the cuts of
barley beef in the shops have a size and
texture which appeal to the eye of the
housewife.
But how does it taste?
Well, no one is exactly certain that
it tastes worse than beef from a grass-
fed animal. However, there is just
enough suspicion to warrant closer in-
vestigation of the whole subject of
flavor.
marketing expert took a look at
a certain line of boiler chickens.
Sales had levelled off after two years
of dramatic increase. It was thought
that something was wrong with the
packaging or that the public had just
grown a little tired of the particular
brand. This would normally have been
fixed by identifying the same broilers
with a new brand, giving a more satisfy-
ing “product image” the old story
of the “De Luxe” of one year becoming
the “Super de Luxe” the next.
Or, as the recent Cuthill report noted,
“King Size” becoming “Jumbo King
Size”.
But what this particular expert did,
to his credit, was to initiate a survey
into the chemical and psychological
factors that go to make up the taste
and flavor ideas of the consumer.
Tests were started on chickens of
various ages and on various feeds to try
to find out which birds would please
the taste-conscious consumer most.
Killing and packaging methods also
are coming under scrutiny.
For example, is it better to degut the
bird immediately or to let it hang for
a while?
The question of whether a certain
amount of exercise has a bearing on the
flavor is likewise being looked at.
There are no definite conclusions yet.
Quite obviously, the most important
factor of all, what the consumer is pre-
pared to pay for the product, will have
to be investigated in its turn.
