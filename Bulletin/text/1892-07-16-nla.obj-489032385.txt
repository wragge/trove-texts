“THE BULLETIN."
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy,
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Comolete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
'' State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System-one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance,
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin,
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is nob
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
ar.u has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, aeainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
no”t connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found m the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightfor—ard ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SATURDAY, JULY 16, 1892.
Compulsory Arbitration.
Somebody or other—Ave forget his name at
the present time—has defined this as the age
of arbitration. The optimist—whom Ave have
ahvays Avith us, the placid, fat philanthropist
Avho lives on an annuity, the benevolent
characters who compile hymn-books, the
comforting old women of both sexes who
hold forth at tea-meetings, and the maudlin
incubus of theology iu general have grown
enthusiastic of late years about the “better
spirit ” which is gradually bringing about the
extinction of Avar and turmoil. Peace,
regarded as a species of pale somnambulist
wandering on the house-tops and carrying in
his hand the white flower of a blameless life,
is alleged to bo taking the place of the
ancient law of the survival of the most brutal
and those with the biggest teeth. The age
of arbitration has begun—the age, that is,
Avhen everybody wants someone else to arbi-
trate, and no one Avill arbitrate himself.
Various Australian Legislatures have passed,
or are about to pass, conciliation laws for the
settlement of industrial disputes, and in the
treaties between employers and employes it
has become common to insert clauses provid-
ing for the peaceful settlement of future
difficulties by reference to umpires mutually
appointed. And, meauAvhilo, nobody makes
use of tho Conciliation Acts, and when
industrial disputes arise cither the arbi-
tration clause is torn up or else the
party which loses its case refuses to
be bound by tho decision. The struggle
which has commenced at Broken Hill over
the ruins of the old treaty between the com-
panies and the Miners’ Union, is a fair com-
mentary on the value of the new system of
peaceful settlement as against the ancient
system of settlement by violence. Tho one
seems to lead to jmuch the same results as
the other.
# « «
The one incurably Aveak point in the pro-
gramme is that the conciliation system is
entirely voluntary. It Avas regarded as a
triumph when the miners and employers of
Broken Hill met in conference two years ago
and drew up an agreement, the first principle
of which was that all future troubles were to be
settled by arbitration. But, unluckily, there
is no court in New South Wales or in Aus-
tralasia which has authority to enforce that
agreement. It was merely a contract which
either party could break before the ink Avas
dry, if it felt so inclined. It was morally
binding, provided the persons bound had
any morals, and not otherwise. There was
no penalty for a breach of the solemn obliga-
tion, except the vague possibility that some-
body might be lost in a future world. The
State, Avhich takes cognisance of almost every
other kind of written contract, takes no
notice whatsoever of this. And even the
boasted conciliation schemes, which promise
sooner or later to become laAv in all
these provinces, do absolutely nothing
to remedy the defect. They all pro-
vide an elaborate system, whereby both
parties to an industrial dispute can arbitrate
if they both feel inclined ; and not other-
wise. If they both feel inclined then they
can arbitrate, of course, Avithout a Concilia-
tion Act just as they have been able to do
ever since the days before antiquity was
born, and as they can do till the end of time ;
if they don't feel so inclined, then the dis-
pute will be settled in the same old way that
prevailed when conciliation was not invented.
The scheme simply authorises all parties to
remain as before or otherwise, just as they
may be disposed. It is the embodiment of
good-natured foolishness and fuzzy-headed
philanthropy, and is of no use whatever,
save as an advertisement for some kindly but
muddled soul Avho probably desires to do
good but doesn’t know lioav to begin.

If the arbitration system is beneficial it
ought to be enforced ; if it is not then it
ought to be entirely left alone. There is no
middle course. In all other matters the law
is, or attempts to be, definite ; it is only in
social legislation that it is utterly hazy and
unsatisfactory. It has decided that it is good
fur the homicide to be hanged—that it is
good for him, and for society, and for the
hangman, and for the carpenter avlio puts up
the gallows—and therefore it says distinctly
that he shall be suspended by the nesk till
he is dead ; the idea of enacting that he shall
be hanged if he is quite agreeable and not
otherwise is not embodied inthe criminal code
anywhere. No legislator ever dreams of
suggesting that a prisoner shall only be
flogged if he signifies his consent, or im-
prisoned if he entirely approves. The great
object of laAv is to - make everybody Avith
Avhom it comes in contact do or suffer some-
tiling of Avhich he does nob necessarily
approve. Yet if any measure is proposed to
fix the maximum hours of labour, or to
abolish sAveating, or to prevent industrial
troubles by establishing a court which shall
have power to deal Avith disputes between
employers and employed and to decide
Avhich party is in the wrong, it is invariably
hampered with a proviso that it shall only
apply in cases where all persons concerned
are perfectly agreeable ; and as the persons
concerned never are agreeable—if they Avere
there Avould be no dispute to settle —the
measure is so much waste paper. It is
admitted that there is a great wrong some-
Avhere, else no one would desire to legislate
on the subject, but this particular variety of
wrong, unlike all others, is only to be
righted if the persons who profit by it have
not the slightest objection.
# # *
The plea advanced against compulsory
arbitration in industrial disputes is that it is
an undue interference Avith the “liberty of
the subject.” It is time this ancient fallacy
Avere abandoned. The subject has no liberty
worth speaking of, he never had any,
he never will have any. Ho is hedged
in by thousands of laws, byo-laws, and
regulations of all sorts and descrip-
tions. There are penalties if he, being a
professional gardener, works in his own
garden on Sunday, if he doesn’t “keep
off the grass,” if lie burns rubbish within
certain boundaries, if he slaughters cattle
except under certain narrow conditions, if
he drives too fast within a city or if he
doesn’t drive fast enough, if he carries his
own revolver in his pocket, if lie sells his
own liquor Avithout a license, if he doesn't
help a policeman to arrest a murderous
maniac when called upon, if he doesn’t tell
his wife’s age in the census paper, or doesn’t
duly blast the character of some unfortunate
woman in the same document by stating that
she isn’t his Avife, and a thousand other
things of the same description. The laAv
seizes his infant and vaccinates it against his
Avill, it abducts his children for educational
purposes, it kidnaps his wife and family and
puts them on board an infected hulk at the
slightest suspicion, of certain diseases. For
several centuries it arrested and gaoled tho
employer who paid more than a certain
maximum Avage, and an exceedingly small
one at that, and it sent into penal servitude
the workmen who combined to ask for an
increase of pay, and called their offence
“conspiracy.” And among all these and
innumerable other restrictions, past and
present, there is very little “ liberty of tho
subject,” and as civilisation advances that
little promises to be every day less and less.
For that vaunted liberty is only the right of
ev r ery man to do what he likes Avith his own
the right to wallop his own nigger—to do
as he pleases with his property, his wife, his
child, or his servant—the right to dislocate
the entire commercial system of the nation,
in order to make a corner in flour or in silver
scrip, or to rig the market in coal shares—
utterly regardless of any injury thereby
inflicted on the rest of the community. And
civilisation teaches that no man has the right
to use his property or his liberty in any way
that is detrimental to society at large. The
law does not even allow a citizen to die when
he wants to, and when his life is not his own
the plea that his property should be his own
is out of date.
# • *
The only logical method of arbitration is
by the establishment of a court, worked on
inexpensive principles, which shall have
absolute power to settle promptly all dis-
putes between employers and employed, to
give costs against the losing party, and to
enforce its own decrees in the same manner
as the other courts of the country. The
present system of “ trial by combat,” which
decides against the party that starves first,
and in favour of the one whose resources
hold out longest, is utterly opposed to all
the principles of justice, as justice is now
understood. In all disputes save only those
between Capital and Labour, the law arro-
gates to itself the right to decide between
the conflicting parties. It promptly sup-
presses the creditor who seeks to obtain re-
dress hy engaging in a free fight with his
debtor, or the person who protects himself
from trespass by judicial combat with the
trespasser. It attempts to supply a remedy,
either by civil or criminal process, for every
possible difficulty save one, and to furnish
redress for the breakage of any lawful con-
tract, except such a one as that which has
just been trodden underfoot by the silver
companies of Broken Hill. But in the
eternal conflict between Capital and Labour
it stands by, and leaves the issue bo be settled
by the ordeal of hunger —which is just a
trifle more brutal and illogical than the old
English ordeal by boiling water—with an
imbecile conviction that the side which gets
hungry first must be in the wrong. The
position is illogical. A legal system which
is good in small disputes, but dare not inter-
fere with great ones, is too feeble and useless
to be worth having.
The Great Conspiracy.
The conspiracy of Capital developes and con-
solidates. The Broken Hill affair is merely one
of its symptoms. The generalship is all on one
side. Capital chooses its time, prepares for a
campaign, forms its plans, provides for its
communications, entrenches itself, and affronts
its foe. That foe, never stopping to consider
whether a trap lias been laid for it, instantly
rushes to the fray, always ready although
unprepared. This is an excellent way to get
defeated. The Broken Hill strikers were prac-
tically defeated before they entered into action.
Capital possesses leaders who have learned to
“organise victory.” The conditions subject to
which the struggle was inaugurated were these:
In every Australian province the labour market
was gorged with hordes of unemployed. In
New South Wales a vast strike had not long
before been defeated, although all the condi-
tions were far more favourable for its success
than they are to-day. The head organisation of
the Union was tottering and without influence
or power. A reaction, political as well as
social, had set in against the pretensions of the
labouring classes. The capitalist class was, if
not as strong in pocket as it ordinarily is,
elated and in great heart. It had obtained con-
trol of the entire daily press; Hosts of quon-
dam opponents or waiters-on-events were giving
in their adherence. If there was one place
where they could provoke a combat with more
advantage than another, it was at Broken Hill.
Now, it has been variously alleged that the
principal and another mine being in danger of a
slide in the workings, the directors have chosen
that time to lay the mine idle, and that the
men have seized the occasion to strike because
the directors dare not suspend the works
of maintenance which were in progress.
One thing of these two is undoubted ;
the men reckoned that the directors dare
not suspend operations for long. They
have not permitted the other possibilities to
weigh with them ; first, that there may be no
danger of an extended slide ; second, that the
directors, anticipating that thet’C will be a
heavy collapse, have wanted to get the men
out cheaply, in view of the enormous sums
they might have to pay to widows and orphans
should any large number lose their lives by
catastrophe in the mines ; and third, that the
directors merely desired to suspend operations,
cheaply again, until the movements of the dis-
turbed ground took definite direction, and
enabled them to decide on a plan of future
operations. It did not, apparently, occur to
the leaders of the strike that although there
are thousands of men who go down and hew in
the bowels of the mine, the directors, kept
advised by skilled overlookers and surveyors,
whose main business it is to view and inspect
all parts of the works, must be in a better posi-
tion to judge what the extent and tendency of
the internal movement of the strata arc, than
could be gained by the actual toiler.
# # *
The men have undertaken the conflict with
every chance against them. The reserve-funds
of their own Union are not sufficient, we be-
lieve, for more than a fortnight. The general
military-chest of Unionism is depleted. The
coal-miners of Northumberland have had
troubles enough of their own on their hands,
and begin to perceive that there are more ahead.
But what more than anything else seems to
have encouraged the silver-miners to undertake
the rash conflict has been a misapprehension of
their actual weakness. Numbering something
like 5000 men, planted in a remote corner of
New .South Wales, to reach which about four
days travel, at vast expense, through two other
provinces, must be undertaken by any force
sent to control them, they have fancied
that they are, physically, masters of the
situation. But no more preposterous
mistake could be made. The lessees of
the mines will certainly not submit to leave
them unworked for ever. They reckon, beyond
doubt, that they will be able to starve thy
strikers into submission—a brutal calculation
which will bear fruit in time to come. But
should they be deceived in that expectation, or
should the strikers, rendered desperate by the
failure of their resistance and irritated by d e .
privation of the necessaries of existence, attempt
to commit devastation on the works, they count
upon the forcible intervention of the (Govern-
ment of the country to the full extent, if need-
ful, of the resources available. This confidence
is perfectly justified. No Ministry dare, or
could, neglect or refuse to uphold the laws as
they exist on the Statute-book. Even con-
ceiving the now extremely improbable case of
the reins of constitutional authority being held
during any similar crisis by a Labour Ministry,
and such Ministry declining to uphold the laws
—to protect property from destruction, and to
support non-union labour in entering into
employment in place of strikers, the ultimate
result would be precisely the same. In the
event ot forceful resistance to a Government
which intervened to maintain the integrity of
the laws, resistance would be insurrection.
Supposing the insurrectioparies to get the
upper hand, the local forces of soldiery, volun-
teers, and special constables do not comprise
the whole of the Government resources. Behind
these stand the entire forces of the Empire,
which in such a case would, without hesitation
and with little ruth, be brought into action. On
the other supposition, that a N.S. Wales
Government refused to take any adequate action
to protect property and the right of non-union
labour to earn a dirty living, that would he
“ treason,” and would assuredly be quelled by a
covp-cVetat, backed up by the Imperial forces.
* # *
It is, therefore, the sheerest folly for un-
armed men to imagine that because they
practically hold the town, the mines, and
the district of Broken Hill at their mercy for
the moment, they actually dominate the posi-
tion. Their resources are really limited to the
moral and economic pressure which they may
be able to bring to bear. These influences
appear altogether inadequate to justify any
expectations that success will attend the
strikers. Capital, having recently learned from
Labour the lesson that union is strength, is
banded together. The first sharp evidence of
that fact was furnished to the Broken Hill
strikers by the concerted action of the stock-
salesmen, in refusing to supply Broken Hill
butchers with beasts on credit terms. Credit
to the butcher means credit to their customers
—the strikers. The refusal of that credit dis-
closed at once the policy of starvation which
is one of the weapons in the arsenal of the
capitalists. There is no mistaking the signi-
ficance of this. The capitalistic class regards
the working class as an enemy and doesn’t care
enough to disguise it. Broken Hill is to be
dealt with as a town held by a garrison of foes
—it is not to be permitted to provision itself.
It is a beleaguered place, besieged and blockaded
by the forces of Capital, and is to be starved to
a surrender. This is indeed one of the mildest
methods of reducing a hostile place, but it is
war, nevertheless, and will be recognised as
such by the vanquished. There is no prospect
of early reprisal. There seldom is in cases
of the kind. But unless the conquered be
exterminated the rancour created does not die.
On the contrary, it breeds and multiplies. The
more complete the conquest and the more
decisively the victors use their advantage, the
bitterer, the longer abiding is the spirit of
vengeance engendered thereby. The hatred
of the Poles against Russians, Prussians,
and Austrians; the rancour of the Irish
against the English, and of the French
against the Germans, illustrate the case.
Capital commences now in Australia to sow the
wind, careless, although it must sooner or later
reap the whirlwind. It becomes every day more
evident that, throughout at least the English-
speaking world, the make-believe politics of the
past half century arc about to be replaced by a
real and desperate struggle. The gentle con-
tentions between rival syndicates for possession
of place will not much longer continue. The
toilers begin to recognise that from neither
Tory or Whig, Conservative or Liberal
have they anything to hope. The voice of the
political charmer exercises a diminishing in-
fluence. What the people now want is not
bunkum Liberal legislation, but fuller reward
for their labours. And having at last got a
distinct view of what is really worth struggling
for, it is certain that they will henceforth never
cease to strive for it. Unhappily, they are not
equally clear about the methods by which their
aims may Ire realised, and no one is able to tell
them. They feel that they are unfairly dealt
with, but how to achieve a fairer adjustment
they are uncertain. Socialist writers otter them
one solution, Georgeites press upon them another
quite different. There are hosts of advisers,
and the clamour of the expounders of jarring
systems stuns and confuses the listener, how-
ever attentive. One thing, however, is certain—
that in the direction of so re-organising society,
that the worker shall receive a larger propor-
tion than at present allowed him of what he
creates, the working class will henceforth move.
And they will not be content to pub their trust rn
the smooth soothings of a class of men unsym-
pathetic with their cravings. They will prefer
men of their own order—less accomplished
doubtless, but likely to be in earnest.
* / # *
Politics will consequently tend constantly to
be less of a game and more of a real conflict.
This can already be appreciated by anyone who
takes the trouble to note the accentuated
bitterness of tone to-day adopted by the bour-
geois class with respect to Trades-Unionists as
well as the increasing acerbity of the labour-
ing class to the Capitalist. The forces on cac >
side are not at the present time at all equally
balanced. Capital possesses powerful advant-
ages. Not only arc all orders of Capita- 13
firmly united, but they have on their side a
the influence of social predilections, the ®8*
of respectability, the adhesion of the
class of wage-earners and other high y °
decently remunerated servants, and of a hos 0
timid and sycophantic persons. But notlrrub
is nrore assured than that, as the strugg
proceeds and its aim and its proposed resu
became better understood, the Cause of Laoo


must triumph. If a majority, ever so
so small, could enrich itself by the oppression
0 f a minority, the case of the latter would
bo hopeless indeed. But since it is absolutely
demanded that a vast majority shall suffer
deprivation of everything which renders life
enjoyable, and even tolerable, in order that a
small minority may revel in affluence, it seems
as certain as anything in this world can he that
the position cannot have permanence. The last
resource —the certain resource—of misery is
violence, and when it comes to that Providence
on the side of the big battalions. The men
who, to-day, take advantage of opportunity to
press the workers down in the scale of comfort-
able life, probably neither mean to compress
human feelings to the point of explosion, nor
would admit that they are doing so. They
protest daily that they have no' desire to
lower wages unreasonably, and they do
not see that the true interest of their class
j s to strive to keep wages up. But they
are, unconsciously, mere windmills, driven
to grind the faces of the poor by ill-winds of
whose deadly nature they have no understand-
ing. Competition is their ruling and over-
mastering power. The man in trade mmt sell
as cheaply as any other man in his line, or he
must cease to sell. Modern invention has so
brought communities into touch for trade pur-
poses that the worst-paid labourer in the world
is often the necessary standard for all labour
applied to any specific community. The man
in trade struggling for his own existence is con-
sequently driven by a necessity, which he feels
but does not understand the rationale of, to
press down the wage-rate of any employes who
receive more than the worst-paid labourer any-
where. And when his labourers resist, he
becomes furious because they are so unreason-
able as not to recognise his necessities in the
matter.
* * *
But there are a few enterprises to which these
necessities for pressing down wages do not
apply. A monopoly of manufacture is one of
these. The extraction of the riches of a natural
wealth - store is another. The Broken Hill
silver-mines afforded, and still afford, resources
ample for sustaining every man who assists
to extract their rich deposits. There is
not, in this particular case, any grounds for
talking about returns for capital invested or
for risks undertaken. The capital invested has
already been repaid a thousand fold, and all
the risks encountered by the adventurers who
explored and opened the mineral veins, re-
warded. What is now urged is that the
labourer shall consider the hard case of the
speculator who gambled in shares. Because
some men wagered that the mine would be
worth something absurd, the hewer of the ore
is commanded to be content with less than he
would otherwise be conceded. It is natural
surely that such an impudent proposal should
be resented and resisted by the toiler bathed in
sweat and absorbing lead-poison through every
open pore. It is natural, indeed, hut it is none
the less to be regretted that such resentment
should have hurried the victims to a course so
precipitate and ill-considered that it can only
increase their own sufferings, and help to put
hack the day of the ultimate liberation of their
Avhole class from tyranny and spoliation.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Bloated Compositor.
A few weeks ago the daily papers of Sydney
gave notice—despite the fact that they all claim
to be booming on top of a “ high-water mark,”
and to have the “largest circulation in New
South W ales ” —that poverty and depression
compelled them to make a reduction in the
wages of their compositors. Concerning this
matter, one “F. W. Marks” states the case
lor the poor, bankrupt newspaper proprietor in
the columns of Sydney Evening News ; or
rather, unless appearances are deceitful and full
yi k ,n^e ’ somebody else states the case, and
'rt Rl r' S signature to the narrative.

With regard to this clumsy and mendacious
statement, The Bulletin has a few remarks to
make. (1) The raising of compositors’ wages
by “leaps and bounds” is a direct Ananias,
inasmuch as for very many years past there has
been only one Jeap, from Is. to Is. Id. per
thousand for day-work and an equally large
advance for night-work, and there has been no
bound at all. (2) The “leading” Sydney
daily journals didn’t average 20 to 26
pages_ every Saturday. There was only
one journal that ever reached such dimen-
sions, and it didn’t “average” any such size,
either, and moreover, in the days when one
paper came out in that abnormally swollen con-
dition at intervals the masters didn’t share
their prosperity with their employes, as the
solitary increase of one penny wasn’t granted
then but long before, and the Association didn’t
“take advantage of the situation.” Also, there
was hardly any more prosperity in N.S.W. then
than there is now, and the Herald only swelled
up as aforesaid in the effort to crush the Daily
Telegraph. (3) £-4 to £7 per week isn’t a
“ princely income ” anyhow. (4) No compositor
in New South Wales makes £7 a week ; the
highest rates, as estimated by the Herald and
Telegraph people at the recent conference,
were £4 10s. to £4 16s., and even these were
overstated, and further they represent some-
thing like 13 hours’ work per diem—mostly
night work in an unhealthy atmosphere and
under a glare of artificial light. (5). The state-
nent that “ the masters would be able to main-
tain their 20 or 26 pages ” if only the composi-
tor’s wages were reduced, is an insult to any
human intelligence. Out of every £4 spent in
producing those extra pages £3 is spent in
paper and the compositor gets less than £1 ; the
proposed reduction in wages will save just
about Is. Od. out of the latter amount, and if
the S.M. Herald and the Sydney D.T. are
unable to pay that Is. 6d. their chances of pay-
ing the other £3 18s. 6d. are too small to be
worth mentioning. And, last of all, the dis-
cordant howl of Marks arises because the com-
positors didn’t ask that their wages might be
cut down, and because they didn’t, the gentle-
man with the Hebrew name calls them delin-
quents, and wants “ a lesson ” meted out to the
“offenders.” Did Marks ever ask that his
wages should be reduced, and if so, was his
desire gratified? Also, did the shareholders
ever demand a reduction in dividends, and is
the business manager praying for a smaller
salary and wanting it paid at longer intervals ?
An Ungrateful Nation.
For the last two years or thereabouts, ever
since Samuel Griffith began to show the first
symptoms of that political insanity which is
now fast driving him to ruin, it has been his
plaint that he has done much and suffered much
for the people of Queensland, and having thrown
his Acts of Parliament before swine, the latter
now turn and rend him. A few days ago,
during the debate on the new Bill for the
Prevention of Workmen from Voting, he raised
this old, old whine once more, as follows :
Sir Samuel Griffith then referred to his efforts two or
three years ago to give the workers the Eight-hours Bill.
They declined to accept it, because he could not see his
way to make it compulsory, and ever since then every-
thing he had done had been wrong in their eyes.
The history of that Bill is worth recalling, as a
fair sample of the things which Griffith did
for Queensland, and for which Queensland
refuses to be thankful. Sir Samuel’s Eight-
hours Bill was, as he defined it, a “ declaratory
measure,” inasmuch as it “declared” that no
man or woman ought to be required to work
more than eight hours per diem. It might, with
quite as much effect, have declared that no
man should have a wooden leg, and that persons
who fall overboard in the middle of the Indian
Ocean ought to keep dry and receive a legacy of
£70,000. It didn’t prohibit any master working
an 16 hours per diem if he wanted to. It
didn’t raise anybody’s wages one penny, or
reduce anybody’s hours of toil one single second.
It only gave to the workers what they had
already—the right to work only eight hours if
they could manage it, and if they couldn’t
manage it then it gave them full power to stay
as they were before. It couldn’t be called an
Act of Parliament because it didn’t act ; it
wasn’t a law, for no one even proposed that it
should be enforced. The result would have
been just the same as if Griffith had brought
in and passed the Ten Commandments or the
New Testament, And the workers didn’t
“decline to accept it” because there was
nothing either to decline or to accept; they
simply forbore to let oft' rockets and kindle
bonfires and yell themselves hoarse for Griffith
as the saviour of his country, and that politician
has been raving mad ever since at their “ in-
gratitude. ” All Griffith’s democratic measures
were more or less “ declaratory ” after the same
fashion ; his anti-democratic measures are not
“declaratory ” but concrete and definite. And
somehow Queensland has got tired of the
“ declaratory ” business.
The Broken Treaty,
The great lock-out at Broken Hill still con-
tinues, and the S. M. Herald and the Sydney
Telegraph and the Melbourne Argus still hold
forth in six fierce leading articles every week
about the “ cruel and savage ” mode of warfare
practised by the Broken Hill miners, and tell
how all “ right-thinking persons ” should rise
to protest against their’faithlessness. And by
dint of much hard perversion of the truth they
have actually persuaded many people that, in
some way or other, there has been a gross
breach of faith on the part of the workers.
Therefore, The Bulletin prints the following-
statement of the case from the S. M. Herald
in order to convict that journal out of its own
mouth :—
An agreement was entered into in September, 1890. It
has been in force ever since. The first clause of the
agreement is an important one. It provides that “in the
event of any future trouble arising, the point or points at
issue shall be referred to a court of arbitration of an equal
number on either side—say three; and, failing their
being able to agree, that an umpire shall be appointed
who shall be either the Chief Justice or a Judge of the
Supreme Court of any of the Australasian colonies.” The
companies hold, however, that this clause, so far as the
present dispute is concerned, does not apply. They have
decided to stope ore by contract. With this view they
wish to remove the restriction in clause 1 of the agree-
ment relating to it. Had the moaning or application of
the words “stoning by contract ’’ been in question, then
the.v admit that reference to. arbitration under clause 1
would have been the proper course to pursue; but, as
these words are not questioned, they hold tharthe pro-
vision by arbitration does not apply ', , . By clause 4
it was provided that contracts other than for stojnm£ of
ore should bo allowed as heretofore. This menrfsPxIiat
any work about the mine could he done by contract with
the exception of the’ stopinj of ore. . . . By some
oversight, no notice is provided for in the agreement in
the event of either side wishing to give it up ; hut it was
thought that iu the present instance 30 days’ notice would
ho ample.
The agreement, therefore, provides that in the
event of “ any future trouble” arising, the
matter is to be decided by arbitration. The
employers emphatically refuse to arbitrate, yet
if the present is not a “ trouble,” then what do
the employers and the Herald and Telegraph
call it ? Also, if it isn’t a trouble, why arc the
employers and their organs so much troubled
about it? The agreement provides that ore
shall not be sloped by contract, and the em-
ployers autocratically announce that they arc
going to slope ore by contract. Therefore, the
employers have broken both clauses of the
treaty. The suggestion that they are willing
to arbitrate over the meaning of the term
“sloping by contract” is pure idiocy; what-
ever the meaning may bo, the thing itself is
forbidden by their own solemn agreement. If
a treaty provides that one of the parties to it is
not to be hanged, and he is hanged all the
same, it doesn’t matter though the other party is
willing to arbitrate as to the meaning of the word
hanging. And the further statement that, “by
some oversight, ”no provision was made for either
party breaking the agreement on giving formal
notice is a worse absurdity even than the rest.
The agreement was absolute and perpetual
unless varied by arbitration. If it wasn’t, then
the arbitration clause was useless, for either
party had only to give notice that it wouldn’t
arbitrate. When both parties pledged them-
selves to adopt a certain course for the settle-
ment of all future disputes it is a hideous
burlesque to say that they omitted “by an
oversight ” to insert a clause providing that
they need not keep their word unless they felt
so inclined. According to such a system of
ethics there ought to be a clause inserted in
every promissory - note stating that the
maker is not bound to pay provided he
gives notice to that effect, and every contract
should have a proviso setting forth that either
party can break it if he likes. The bald state-
ment that the masters consider the arbitration
clause “ does not apply ” means nothing; it is
not for them but for the arbitrators to decide
whether it applies or not. If they really
believe their own statement, however, then let
the matter {i.e., the question what the agree-
ment means) be referred to any Chief Justice
in Australia, Tasmania, or Maoriland, or to all
of them combined, and let these authorities
decide on a strictly legal basis whether the
present difficulty is covered by the arbitration
clause or not. If the Broken Hill directors
will not accept some such suggestion as this,
then they are convicted by their own act.
All they have done so far is to try themselves
and find themselves not guilty, and even Judas
Iscariot could have done that much."
Premier Griffith refuses to start relief works
in Queensland, for fear that they should “ keep
up the present high rate of wages.” Great
Tucker ! Men are working at middling hard
labour, with long hours, for 12s. a week!
They are working on sugar plantations in the
cane-brakes for from 14s. to 18s. a week and
rations ! They are working at any farm work,
from sparrow-chirp to curlew-cry, for from 10s.
to 15s. a week and the roughest food ! They
are working on navvying at 4s. a day ! Six-
pence an hour at pick-and-shovel work, and
“damn yer, wotyer straightenin’ yer back
for?” “ The present high rate of wages ”
is the most poetical lie that has ever
come out of the extravagant mouth of
the boss political lawyer of Queensland,
who would swallow his own spine with astonish-
ment if he were asked to undertake any decent
sort of brief under a foe of £100 and be bound
by a penal fine to attend to it, if be had a bigger
fee on the same day. Premier Griffith’s
standard utterances have ever been made up of
reckless cant. When ho denounced Black
Labour years ago, he canted for Exeter Hall.
When he advocated a fairer distribution of
rent, and ranted about work and wages and
wealth, he canted for the poor man. When he
once more clasped the oily and murky Kanaka
to his Christian breast he canted for the capi-
talists. Now, when he .wittingly falsely
declares that the present rate of wages is high,
he is canting for the sweater-employers. The
worst of it is that the world is full of fools and
cant “ pulls it off” every time.
The latest news about Monro’s deceased
Estate Bank is that the institution was
“grossly insolvent” two years ago, and has
since been kept up only by balance-sheets which
the liquidator gently describes as “ misleading.”
“ Misleading,” in such a connection, generally
means that the said documents were garbled
out ,of all shape and recognition, and that a
conscienceless swindle was perpetrated on the
shareholders and depositors. The last edition
of the famous “shrinkage of assets” is that
Monro’s alleged surplus is gone, and that the
bank has departed to unutterable smash witli a
shortage of £1,000,000. Agent General James
got away alive out of Victoria by assuring the
shareholders that there would be several
hundreds of thousands left after all liabilities
were paid, and he virtually pledged his respect-
able bald head as security for the statement. Is
he coming back now to explain the ghastly dis-
crepancy, and if lie isn’t, then is he going to be
fetched back, or what ?
Dear Bulletin, — Freetraders scrupulously
avoid all reference to the fact that it is in-
cumbent upon the nation which buys' in the
cheapest market, that it sell contemporaneously
at the minimum of current rates, as otherwise
there would be no outlet for its produce.
Before being enabled to buy, a country
must necessarily have somethfhg to sell, and
assuming that Cobden’s fallacious theory were
realised, and all the world became converted to
bis fiscal fetish, that nation which sold the
cheapest would, ipso facto, attain commercial
supremacy. Very well, then, on whom would
this distinction inevitably fall ? It. would fall
on China. In these days of international inter-
communication. when the acquisition of the
latest mechanical labour-saving appliances lies
within the reach of all, that country whose
inhabitants showed the greatest ingenuity in
adapting themselves to the manipulation of the
various instruments for manufacture facilita-
tion, and who reproduced most closely the
numerous desiderata of everyday life, would
control the world in manufactures, and, as
regards agriculture, that race which was con-
tent to toil the hardest and longest for the
minimum of remunerative advantages would
take the prize in that department of industry,
lor both of these essentials the Chinese are
specially qualified, iferfbeforth, the Freetrade
party must be known officially as the Mongo-
phile party. Further investigations would
prove absolutely terrifying.—Yours disgustedly,
Chari.es d UN OR.

The miners and iron- workers of Pittsburg
(U.8.A.) are out on strike, owing to the w hole-
sale reduction of wages, and the town is in a
state of civil war. The following cabled
description of an unpleasantness, which took
place between the strikers and the police, will
form a valuable text for many leading articles
upon the horrors and unreasoning brutalities of
trades-unionism :—
The encounter lasted for some hours, nine of the police
being .killed. Finding that they were completely out-
numbered, the surviving police displayed a flag of truce,
but the strikers riddled it with bullets. Afterwards, the
police consented to accept an escort of the men on strike,
and they were then compelled to salute the men’s union
banner.
The point which the cablegrammer does not ex-
plain is that the so-called “police” are not
(Government officers, but the hired bravos sup-
plied by Pinkerton’s agency, and that one side
has as much right to call itself “ police ” as the
other. 1 he “Pinkerton guards ” are a species
of standing army which is let out to anybody
who is willing to pay for it, and which per-
petrates any enormity required for cold spot
cash. It is simply a resurrection of the free-
lances of the Middle Ages—a gang of miscreants
which keeps up a reign of terror in the name
of order. \V hether the strikers or the employers
began the fight in the present instance is not
yet known, but the chances are that
the masters were responsible, for this
reason—if the men were the aggressors
they risked their own lives, while if the
masters begun the fray they only risked the
lives of their hired bravos, and if these w r ere
killed they could always buy more. The
individual who risks himself is always much
more cautious under such conditions than the
one who merely risks someone else. The
Pinkerton system has always been much
approved by capitalists as only a capitalist
can afford to pay a hand of armed rowdies.
Secretary Knox, of the Broken Hill Pro-
prietary Co., made a feeble attempt to
follow, at a respectful distance, in the foot-
steps of the Yankee mine-owners the other
day, when he blandly invited the S.A. authori-
ties to invade New South Wales with a police
force in the interests of the masters—a step
which would be tantamount to civil war.
Attorney-General Barton, however, promptly
squashed Mr. Knox’s efforts to set up in busi-
ness as a Provisional Government at Broken
Hill, and that potentate has since subsided into
his private capacity. Australia is not yet
educated up to the Pinkerton system.

Judge Murray, of New South Wales, has
struck a theory of his own as to the cause of
the abundant perjury which takes place in the
Australian courts. As to the existence of the
aforesaid perjury, not only in Australia but
everywhere else, there is no reason for any
possible doubt whatever. In almost every case
which comes up for trial from one to a dozen
witnesses swear something for the plaintiff, and
about the same number swear the direct oppo-
site for the defendant, and according to the
strict letter of the law, one squad of witnesses
ought to be arrested almost every time. But
even the Judges are so used to this state of
things that they don’t call it perjury except
in extreme cases. Judge Murray’s theory
is that perjury arises because the oath isn’t
administered with sufficient solemnity, gome
official grabs the infected book and passes it to
the witness, and hurriedly gabbles out the
formula ; “ Th’ ev’dence—give—this case-
truth—’hoi’ truth—truth—s’help Gor’,” and it
is all over. If the statement were made slowly
and impressively, in a voice that came from the
lowest sheol of the official’s boots, the moral
effect, in Mr, Murray’s opinion, would be
very different. The Bulletin has grave doubts
about this theory. There are many impressive
things in this world, and the world gets accus-
tomed to them all. The Lord Mayor’s show,
which goes through London in bloated pomp
once a year, is impressive, but we never heard
of anybody being converted thereby. The
Speaker is impressive, so is the curse-scene in
“ Richelieu,” and the Czar when he has climbed
into his imperial robes, and the new policeman
the first time ho goes “ on jury,” and a British
beadle, and the Sydney Post-office, and an exe-
cution, and a blizzard, and the great sea-
serpent, and the doctrine of eternal perdition,
ami yet nobody is impressed much when begets
used to them. If Judge Murray hopes to make
the oath so impressive that witnesses will
always tell the truth, he had better arrange to '
have the testifier taken down into a dungeon
200ft. beneath the surface of the earth with all
his clothes off, and there solemnly sworn on top
of a dead body that emits a green, phosphores-
cent radiance, and spectres should pass before
him, and the Devil should be made to appear
by means of a magic-lantern, and there should
be slow, very slow music. And even then,
when a witness had been sworn two or three
times, ho would probably get used to things
and perjure himself as before. There is nothing
in all this world that is impressive enough to
keep a witness (or a jury) square.

"God Will Provide.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tear down the pales of Rant and Cant,
Wide fling the gates of Common sense,
Plant Reason firm as adamant,
And banish all this Smug Pretence.
Too long have oily preachers tried
To drug us with a platitude :
“ Have patience, for God will provide ”
Have patience-without work or food !
Have patience when the pestilence
Of \V ant and Care is on our brow 1
Then say, in His omnipotence,
W hy does not God provide it now ?
A ou prate about Religion’s charms,
We’ve got as much of that as you ;
And we’ll send up a dozen psalms
Tf He’ll send down a loaf or two.
For though fat piety is vext
When our faith-light is burning dim,
We can’t subsist upon a text,
Or fill our bellies with a hymn.
If you could know a month of woo,
Such as we have through all the years.
You’d understand the sighs that go
Adrift upon a sea of tears.
Come down from off your pulpit-perch.
Come down and share our nothingness,
And test the bubbles of your church
Against the thorns of our distress.
1 is well for you to advocate
The creed which suits the smug and sleek,
L it put aside your gown and *’ plate,”
And try our happy lot a week.
And when the winds blanch your heart’s core,
Say, then, which fashion fits you best ;
Whether the warmth of your home, or
The hell which burns within our breast.
Or kneel and watch your gentle wife
Fall as may fall the stricken dove;
Kneel there and see the slow, harsh stii.'e
Between Starvation and her love.
Loan low and catch her latest breath—
Your soul’s eyes seeking her’s in vain—
Then, your heart dying in her death.
Live dead to everything but Pain.
Not any maiden you have known,
Not any maid in soft romance,
Not any girl on friezes shown,
Or carved in marble or in stone,
Had sweeter trust in sweeter glance
Than"shone in my dear wife’s blue eyes—
Blue as the grace of sky is blue;
Yet Hunger stifled her last sighs
And fed her fleeting soul on rue.
Not any heart of all the hearts
Was purer or was half so pure ;
And all the faith your creed imparts
Was hers to suffer and endure.
And when Sleep battled with Disease,
And Want writhed in the arms of I’.du,
With all that faith she prayed for case.
She prayed—God let her pray in vain !
And there are tears as red as mine
In this great land of ours to-day ;
Ami truths which only shine as shine
Pale stars beneath cloud-veils of gray.
And there are lives deep down the grave
Of I.iie slain in Faith’s tragedy;
And there are hearts which only crave
To break upon their souls and die.
What good to ns to count the worth
Of worthless Christianity ?
What good to suffer hell on earth
To reach a heaven that may not be?
What good to ns the faith which drags
The helpless in its bitter thrall ?
When the wind’s whipping through our rags,
What of the God who shelters all ?
Whfen fat men fatten on a creed
Which binds the poor to kiss the rod ;
When brave hearts only beat to bleed.
One truth stands clear for all to read—
The strangest work of man is—God !

Hobart was afforded a truly Van Demonian
spectacle the other day when 10 handcuffed
seamen were marched through the principal
streets on their way to the lock-up, to lae subse-
quently sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment
each man for—what? For refusing—after five
months’ cruising in an ancient whaleship—to
continue sleeping in “ bunks that were always
wet,” so that “when they turned out they
were always smoking with the damp from the
wet bed-clothes.” They also pleaded the general
unseaworthiness of the ship. The sworn testi-
mony of these 10 men was flatly contradicted by
one man, Hie man wlio laid the charge of “re-
fusing duty"—the skipper, of course. In sen-
tencing the men, the Police-Magistrate stigma-
tised the defence of the men as a “ frivolous
excuse which, although it entailed los* to them-
set res, was not sufficient to justify them in
striking. He had never before heard of a
proper sailor being afraid of a little salt-water.”
Poor .Tack’s best friend would seem to be, after
all, Davy Jones.
The master of the Waireka, lately wrecked on
Avon Island, in the Pacific, had been pre-
viously shipwrecked four times, and the mate—
five. For navigating purposes they employed
au old-fashioned quadrant and an antique chart
which showed the positions neither of Mary-
borough nor Bundaberg. They also anchored on
a lee-shore with insufficient tackle. Later
still a barque was wrecked on flic Lihon
Reef, in the Coral Sea. She had also been
navigated with an obsolete chart of the South
Pacific and the enquiry showed that not a soul
on board could point out any position of the
vessel between the time of her departure from
• ydney and her subsequent wreck. There is
also a ship now lying at Brisbane wharves that
was allowed to pass out of a foreign port with a
whole crew of seven, when her complement
should at least have been double that number.
All of which goes to show that the coffin-ship
is still very much afloat, and that the sailor
should at least know how to swim.

81G Macquarie strcel North, Sydney, July 13, 1892.
Mr Dear Moor a bin da,—
“ Marjorie,” at Her Majesty’s, is a picture-opera, and
en if the pretty music were below Christy Minstrel pitch
.one would still sit dumb with admiration watching the
soul-satisfying effect of Laun’s pink legs against that load
of yellow hay—and other graceful contrasts. “ Marjorie ”
is a chronologically-arranged source of public interest
until you come to tire Gavotte Fantastique, and there the
management, after an heroic struggle to overcome the
insidious evil, have lapsed suddenly and hopelessly 7 into
accordeon skirts. I don’t think there were any fan frocks
in Henry Something’s time—but let’s be lenient. I’m
sure even the most limber ballerina couldn’t arrange her
bang with her toes in a stomacher.
Florence Young plays the name-part, and I want to find
a little fault with her. Let me put it as between woman
and woman. Is it possible that, if you anxiously aw'aited
the momentary arrival of a very desirable sweetheart, you
would scratch your nose as you stood ? And I wish, too,
that the lady wouldn’t look about as if searching the
stage for a pin between the verses of her warbles. But Miss
Young’s gowns in “Marjorie” are very picturesque, and
she looks simply charming in a sort of flushed white
brocade with falling gauze and flittering stage-diamond
necklace, worn in the last act.
Flora Graupner’s fairy-like physique doesn’t afford
much scope for the display of her stage garments, but
the russet frock worn in the “Then lie kissed me” duet
made one quite understand why he did. On Saturday
evening, when this pretty duo got its inevitable recall-
just when the bold, ba’d, bad Earl caught herat the end of
the fetching “ business ” which finishes with the kiss—the
gallery loudly anticipated the chaste salute. Thereupon
Mr. Ryley simply left out the finishing-touch, and a baffled
roar rose from Olympia.
Talking about stage-kisses, it’s interesting to see how 7
keen some play-actors (I haven’t -studied the actresses,
hut the theatrical male always has to seem to play the
hold, baJ part) are on being steeped in realism to the very
lips, while others peck and dab and smack at the girl s
left ear in a horribly cool, undeceptive way. But there
are a couple of stage lovers in a Sydney show who won’t
err 0:1 the stagey side in that direction, and their meetings
and partings arc realistic enough to make every servant-
girl in the house regret that she bad jilted the baker.
When you come to think of it, it doesn’t do to he too
naturally in love behind the floats—it looks too selfish, for
one thing, and it makes every disengaged maiden in the
circle aiprey to fitful melancholy, for another. Of your
charity kiss merely by “ stage direction.”
One or two women must gnash their teeth over the good
f ntune of Louis Brennan, the torpedo-inventor, who is
now a Captain and aC.B., with an honorarium of £112,000
and a Govt, retaining-fee of thousands per annum. Mr.
B. has married an Irish girl, which recalls how Melbourne
belledom used to sneer at Louis’ suit because lie had the
pallid expression of a yet-undiscovercd genius, and the
average, creature-comfort-loving female prefers to be able
to turn her adorer’s yearly stipend up in a directory and
not to be asked to go whacks in a vague and shadowy
income looming in the mist of to-morrow.
But one can’t help pitying a girl who actually rejected
him years ago and married a feather-head who deserted
her, and left her to work for herself and her children. I
wonder how hard she wants to kick the cat when she
hears of those tantalizing thousands ? Knowing of her
struggles her old adorer magnanimously sent her a big
cheque when fortune smiled so widely upon him—but bis
generosity didn’t make her like her luck any better, 1 11
wager. In missing the money it would be better not to
realise what a very good fellow went with it—anyhow,
that’s what I think.
Apropos, the Brennan torpedo, I read, took shape from a
very every-day incident. Its inventor was once fidgeting
with a reel of cotton on a table and discovered that the reel
wouldn’t come to him when he hauled on the thread.
And the torpedo somehow got evolved out of that. I
don’t sec how it could one bit, do you ?
Another effort is being made in Sydney to start a
creche, when there will be a regular flow of infants at
tuppence an hour ; and a lot of women had afternoon tea
and gnsiiy speeches there, the other day, to help tire good
cause forward. Here, as in England, no doubt, we shall
shortly have crfiches where “ladies who take an interest
in political work ” may leave their unhappy children.
Somebody of the peace-making order of architecture
prayed in a daily paper the other day for—what do
you think?—“ more unity amongst women !” Of course,
as, broadly speaking, every woman is, and always has
been, the enemy of every other woman, and will bo world
without end, you couldn’t put up a more necessary
petition if you thought for a week—but then it would be
splendid to coax the moon down once in a way, you know.
The first idea was to form an association “ embracing
women ot all classes,” and at first blush this seems a jolly
sort ot start, but the embracing association was to he only
a “ sisterhood,” and “sisterly love ” was the only senti-
ment admitted, so one’s enthusiasm zero’d at once. But,
to my mind, the unity scheme collapsed when it was
shown that all the members would have to be just and
tell the truth. Imagine a tabby society acknowledging
that Beauty's golden hair wasn’t red. and that Miss Slim
hadn t to squeeze to get into IS-ineh corsets. And also
please let your fancy picture the painted member rising
to truthfully point out that her eyebrows were Indian-
inked ; and another neophyte catching the speaker’s eye
and confessing that she was cotton-wool where you’d
least expect it!
When women dare say “Phooh,” to a parson a lot of
wonders will happen, so it is encouraging to read that, in
England, the women are taking very kindly to the divorce
for-four-years’-desertion idea, at which the cloth kicks
with both heels. The parson, in the eyes of women, is a
little tin god—possibly because he is the only respectable .
road to matrimony, and there’s no fathoming the adora-
tion of every well-regulated female for anything even
remotely connected with the “I will” business. The
Woman Suffragists—if they wish to advance their scheme
on decent lines—will eliminate much of the white
choker and flap-skirt business now mixed up with their
“progressive idea.” The really brainy women of every
community honestly despise ninety out of every hundred
people who get their living as clergymen—in that they
know that the only things really worth worshipping in
males are manliness and ability, and that the average
professional saint is a milk-and-water individual who
couldn’t get his living either with his head or with his
lily white hands ontside his little flock of adoring tabbies
and the miserable men they drag at their heels.
Jennie Lee’s “ Jo,” at the Imperial Opera House, has
been well attended—especially by women who “ love a
good cry.” How Miss Lee can manage to look so haggard
and skeletony, when in real life she is as plump as a peach,
is one of the mysteries of successful make-up. Miss Con-
roy played Lady Dedlock in a modern white satin and
crystal tulle gown which—as everybody else was “period”
—looked as if the lady had harked back half a century or
so to see how her grandfather really carried on. Plain
Mrs. Snagsby, in sandal shoes, was ever so much more
convincing. Apropos of “Jo”—it must he vexing to be
a real actress sent on to do a scene with an amateur.
When Esther (Miss Hardie) and Lady Dedlock in the
second act fled to fondly embrace, they circled round one
another like two belligerent canines waiting for a “ holt.”
Audit the long suffering Conroy hadn’t used her snaky-
black train like an egg-whisk, Miss H. would have been
wrecked upon it, sure as fate.
A combed-up but fatally chatty audience listed to the
still small voice of Miss Gulie (not Julie) Hack, at Sydney
Protestant Hall, on slh inst., and everybody fell in love
with her artistic dressing, which consisted of a thick white
corded silk gown cut en trains and with long sleeves—l
love the singer who doesn’t take both sleeves out of her
gown the moment her name’s down on a programme. The
semi-low bodice was simply draped in the front with
canary-coloured velvet—et ceteras were white gloves,
white shoes and a single string of pearls for necklace.
Simple as sawdust, really, but the effect was like a
picture.
Miss Hack was assisted by Madame Van. Greene, in
cream and blue, who sang “ An Old Garden ” for more than
that rather hollow ballad is worth, and gave, as an encore,
“To Sevilla,” which seems built for her gurgling voice.
Miss Lottie Hymn, in yellow merv., assisted Strauss and
Lucy Alpress in two duets; Mons. Deslouis was in tip-top
form, especially in the valet de chambre aria ; and a fiend
with a basso howl was the only vocalist who interrupted
the harmony on the occasion. Alsc, Mr. Gordon Burnside
got through some pianoforte music with much felicity,
allho’ he wore a heavy ring on his bachelor finger, and
Mr. Nathan looked very beautiful turning over the music.
Mr. Charles Huenerbein accompanied.
In the audience, Miss Clara Manning wore a black lace
gown; Miss Austin also wore black, with an Indian red
opera cloak ; Carrie Swain kept on a grey cloak, edged
with Mongolian fur ; Miss Bessie DO3 le was in simple
black ; Miss Darley wore a cream mull muslin gown, with
a blue bow in her hair ; Madame Kellermann, black, w ith
pink chrysanthemums. By the way, somebody was solo-
ing on the platform, when the seductive “ pop” of a drawn
cork echoed from the dressing-room and spoilt the song,
for it raised as wide a smile as goes round that hall in
Sydney where, if you sit on one side, you can hear the
chink of the dross as the agent tots up the takings.
Some women have no regard at all for their husbands’
feelings in public. For instance, at “ Marjorie,” when
Lauii was comically swarming into that skirted garment,
a lady in front of me turned to her liege lord and said
plumply: “That’s not the way you put your shirt 011,
Henry.” It made me feel quite sorry to see how red poor
Henry’s ears got.
The person who asked me to “k n lly insert in my own
way a par. to the effect that Mr. A. \V. Nathan (M'Namara
and Nathan) was going to study music abroad—is a most
unreliable individual in the social item line, it appears.
Mr. Nathan isn’t going to study music. Cni bono ! as we
say in Rome. A notary public hasn’t to transact his legal
business in C sharp.
Some members of Women’s Literary Society, I see, have
concluded that “French writers of fiction, unlike the
English writers, deal with life entirely 7 upon the surface
and avoid even that amount of introspection necessary to
complete artistic success.” After which slice of remark-
able information I would like to ask in a subdued voice
whether any 7 of the club have ever heard of that great
master of the secrets of the human heart, Mr. Balzac? Also
when the Sydney Women’s Literary Society is going to
publish a volume of introspective stories from the pens of
its own members?
People who travel (speaking by the rule of mob) are
usually very keen on keeping the labels which once
directed their wandering luggage affixed to their traps
for all time, and the more the outer aspect of your Sara-
toga becomes like paper patchwork the more you stick it
proudly on top of y our impedimenta coming home. But
the old label fad has its disadvantages.
For instance, three girls arrived at Brisbane railway-
station the other day in the height of the small-pox scare
with a trunk in tow 7 addressed “Mrs. 11., passenger per
R.M.S. Oroya.” They hadn’t been clasped to the bosoms
of their family ten minutes before a policeman burst into
the premises with a yellow flag in his hand and asked to
see the portmanteau. Then a great light burst upon the
house-father. His girls’ biggest trunk bore the label of a
previous voyage of the infected ship.
With Lady Jersey and her liege gallivanting in New
Caledonia, an article 1 lately read ou that eventful penal
settlement has a certain society interest—especially that
part of it which sets out how the Canaques manage to
keep their female folk in proper driving order. The
women, it seems, are not allowed to approach a man
except on all-fours, and when a husband gets tired of a
wife, he simply eats her! In our higher civilization it’s
usually before marriage that a man declares he wants to
eat his darling.
Miss Bessie Doyle’s first Australian public appearance,
in the churchy Centenary Hall, on 7th inst., was a very
successful fiddle-de-dee, really, assisted by Deslouis, Col-
bourne Baber and Willie Walshc—for a small Turkish-
faced girl who got thro’ gome piano soli head first, was
more of an infliction than an advantage in the bill. As
I remarked before, Miss Bessie fiddles with much finish-
dots all her musical i's, as it were—and the one thing
lacking in her performance will probably go miss-
ing until the weary years pile a few tons of life
experience on her classic head, To put it in poetical
metaphor—you can’t expect the heart of an adult cabbage
<Oll this season ’s sprout. Miss D. polishes off all her items
from memory, but it’s a pity she doesn’t add to an attrac-
tive performance by tuning her violin behind the scenes
instead of on the stage. Squeaky— squokee—squawkee
right in the ear of the audience affects the exaltation of
the performance as much 'as if Hamlet put on his wig
before the footlights.
Miss Doyle’s best effort was the Fantasia Apassionata,
'Uicuxtcmps’i artistically played to Charles Huencrboin’s

Treasurer M‘llwraith (Q.) wants to cut

brutal candour is more bearable than Premier
Griffith’s hypocritical evasiveness and insincere
excuses.
Interviewed last Saturday that amusingly
transparent old humbug, Parkes, solemnly said
that he really hadn’t read any reports of "the
speech made by G. H Reid (wlio has supplanted
him as leader of N.S.W. Opposition). He—haw
—was utterly unaware that Attorney-General
Barton was going to speak at East Sydney that
night. He admitted that he had watched the
progress Of Dibbs in England. Dibbs, he said
was “a Tory of the Tories.” Should any more
cables arrive concerning Dibbs’ English soc ; al
glories Parkes will peg out.
A suggestion has been made that the
colour danger may be evaded in connection with
the Queensland slave-trade by the Government
stipulating that every employer of Kanakas .must
also employ a proportionate number of whites, the
regulation percentage to be determined by a Com-
mission. There is little danger of a Griffil-
wraithian and Sugarocowleyan Parliament like
the present Bananaland legislature passing any
such law, at any rate with any sufficient per-
centage of white “ collaborateurs,” because that
would kill the cheap-labour scheme in one act
and prevent the planters sweating the white men!
The fairest proportion in any such blend (speak-
i-«r off handedly) would be 100 white men to every
Kanaka.
What has become of Samuel Griffith’s old
bay horse, the one he used to ride in the ante-
Kanaka days, when he was won’t to prance down
Queen-street, Brisbane, for the admiration of a
grateful nation? A glittering flunkey used to
bring that horse along every day, and walk him
up and down Queen-street for half-an-hour or so
while waiting for the great man to appear. Then
Griffith would emerge like a statesman who is
lost in thought, and who cares not for the applause
of the unthinking multitude, and amble gently
along the busy thoroughfare, with his eyes cast
downwards, as one who is ’umblo and doesn't
want the people, whom he has saved, to throw
themselves down flat in the middle of the high-
way, and worship him. The bay horse has
vanished now, and so has the flunkey, and no one
seems to know how Samuel gets home from his
office, in these days, but a suspicion is abroad that
he is removed from the back-door in a hay-
van, with the fodder piled on top of him
to conceal him from the public eye, or that he
travels in a hearse, or else waits till after dark,
and then bolts secretly through murky lanes, and
shins in a hidden fashion over his own back
fence and through the kitchen.
Capt. Wawn, an old Queensland South-
Sea blackbirder and a fairly good artist, is
“kidding” the Queenslander with fairy-tales
about the wide-awake swindling powers of the
Kanaka “recruits.” According to him, this
often happens ; A “ boy ” is bought and paid for
by giving his friends or chief about £2 worth of
presents. He enters the boat willingly, while his
friends rip into the bush. As soon as the boat
shoves of, he springs oveiboard and rejoins his
kindred, who thus chisel the poor innocent white
man out of his goods. As the kidnappers are
forbidden by the Queensland regulations to pur-
sue a deserter, they have to grin and bear their
losses. It would be a happy thing for Australia
if this sort of swindle were extensively true. The
Polynesian would soon settle the Queensland
slave-trade, if lie became aware that he could
safely chouse the would-be blackbirder every
time. Although Captain Wawn does not confess
the fact in so many words, his description (pre-
suming that he inspired the letter-press that
accompanies his illustrations) is tantamount to an
admission that the Kanaka recruits are “pur-
chased ’ for so much “ trade.” They are, in fact,
“slaves” for a defined term of years, and no
amount of sophistry can refute that conclusion.
Captain Wawn, some years ago, told the writer
that slavery is a part of the tribal Jaws of the
Polynesians; that each “boy” belongs to the
chief, and is at the latter’s absolute disposal.
The blackbirders treat with the chief, and if they
satisfy that potentate’s cupidity, the “boy” has
to go aboard, “willy-nilly.” A “ boy ”on the
islands cannot even marry without his chief’s
permission.

“La Cigale” has died and “ Marjorie ” has
taken its place at Her Majesty’s (Sydney). There
is much freshness and quaint humour about this
piece. The scene is laid in England in the days
when the old, fiereeKing.John had j ust died through
ra o-e and too much fish. Therefore, there are sundry
knights in the play—warriors of the old, cumber-
some type who got into their armour with a
hydraulic shoe-horn, and dragged their helmets
off with a bootjack. Also, there are friars and
demoiselles, and old, baronial keeps, and port-
cullises, and donjons, and strange, ivy-clad, moth-
eaten towers, and green, cold, slimy moats; and
the parties concerned throw np entrenchments on
the smallest provocation, and cast each other into
the murky dungeon which is beneath the draw-
bridge. The knights clank drearily in their mail
as they struggle along, and the oldest one of the
lot, whose armour has evidently been long up the
spout, is just a sword and a mass of rust and a
gouty toe hobbling to the field. There is a vague,
uncertain flavour of crucifixes and racks and
headsmen and blocks and shining axes in the story,
and an ancient, comic, hairless serf pervades it, and
the flag of England streams wildly in the gale, and
the demoiselles, one of whom is 50 years of age,
cheer their lovers on to glory or the grave. The
demoiselles of the Middle Ages extended up to 80
years of age, which takes the gloss off many a
mediaeval tale. Also, a lurid radiance shines from
the mighty bills and axes of the English soldiery ;
and somewhere in between the second and third
acts the battle of Lincoln is supposed to even-
tuate, when the French and English hacked each
other to rags while pent up and suffocated in the
narrow streets of the cathedral city ; and all the
principal characters come back in triumph, bar-
ring the oldest and most deeply mortgaged knight
who returns with only one eye, and then there is
more portcullis, and more old baronial tower, and
the earl tries to commit bigamy, and puts his wife
in gaol, and sends his sister and the knight with
one eye into a dungeon, and chains up all the
demoiselles he can get hold oil', and arrests the
comic, hairless serf, and howls around like a grand
old English nobleman of the mediaeval times.
* # #
The above is a faint and imperfect outline
of the plot of a really excellent opera. There is
much pleasant music in “ Marjorie,” and sundry
pretty songlets of the kind that were alleged to be
sung by our very-very-exceedingly-great-grand-
raothers when they were young, and the staging
of the show is particularly gorgeous, and the comic
serf is played by George Lauri, who has a certain
ironical humour of his own that is very pleasant,
and who falls off a ladder with much eclat, and a
loud shriek. Whether Lauri is quite an effective
substitute for Elton is a matter that requires con-
sideration, but at all events he is very near it.
Howard Vernon, as the ancient knight in the
misfit mail, is another cause for profound joy, and
Ids duet with Miss Elsie Cameron, the oldest of
the three demoiselles, while the horrid clank of his
iron coat-tails keeps time to the music, is a quaint
and pretty conceit. Florence Young and Flora
Graupner, the other two demoiselles, are both
deserving of public support, and the former, who
fills the part of Marjorie, is obviously improving.
Henry Bracy isn't supposed to be funny—the
tenor is always a serious youth with yearnings in
Ids soul—but he sings nicely and makes love to
Marjorie like a romantic tenor of the thirteenth
century. As for Charles Ryley he can always be
taken tor granted, and when he rages in his feudal
towers he fills the bill of the Norman baron as he
was, or ought to have been. Further, Arthur
Bissaut, as a base brown monk, deserves a word of
praise. He doesn’t say much, and lie has little to
0°, but there is unspeakable villainy in his eye,
and Ins wrinkled mouth and his tonsure and his
cowl please our aesthetic soul.

Nearly everybody in Sydney bore a hand
at E. W. Hoy go’s benefit in Sydney Criterion on
Wednesday last week. The show commenced at
a quarter to two, but the house was rushed before
noon, and even among the gods seats were selling
at 5s. each. If the management had offered the
privilege of hanging on among the flies at half-a-
crown a head, the money would have been forth-
coming. It was a mighty crush, and the
wreckage that remained when the show was over
proved that many a forlorn female had foun-
dered in the confusion. The performance lasted
nearly four hours, and contained slabs of
everything, including “Trial by Jury,” done
by the company from Her Majesty’s, “The
Dream of Eugene Aram,” which chestnut (wo
heard Irving recite it twice and so wish to hear it
from the lips of no other mortal man) was
contributed by Walter Bentley, a comedietta
by Myra Kemble and E. W. lioyce, a piece of
“ Romeo and Juliet ” by Mrs. Bernard Beere and
Otho Stuart, a play without words by Mens.
Marius —the most lurid success of the defy—
“ Moriarty,” “Ri-tooral,” “Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,”
and several hundred other items. Also there was
a farewell speech by the departing hero, in which
he remarked feelingly, as he thought of the
rejected gate-money, that ho believed the crowd
would have filled the Town Hall if that building
had been available,
The other shows of Sydney are in a more
or less comatose condition. The Cyelorama, and
Daniel Tracey at the School of Arts, also the
Waxworks magician and the Coogee and Bondi
Aquariums are in their accustomed health. But
the Criterion has shut its doors for the time being,
thereby leaving a lamentable void, and the Royal
hasn’t begun to rise from its ashes, and the
Garrick is waiting for the upheaval of Professor
Hertz, who, at time of writing, is advertised to
open on Thursday (14th). He will be supported
by Ered. Mason, Rose Hearing, and the Fairy
Four from the late Royal Pantomime, and his
merits will bo dealt with in next issue of The
Bulletin.

One of the saddest stories of depression
and hard fortune is that of Mr. Charles Burford,
the well-known actor, who now appeals to the public.
Mr. Burford has been on the Australian stage for
over 30 years, and for at least 25 years he was
deservedly a favourite in all the Australasian pro-
vinces. But the Australian stage is not a profit-
able field for any except the imported star and the
scene-painter, and in Mr. Burford’s time it was
much less profitable than it is now. Also he
never learnt the art of making other men work for
him while he took the applause and the profits, and
the man who is merely a good, hard-working
actor has few opportunities of accumulating a
pile for his old age. Moreover, there is a fashion
in stage favourites as in other things, and the era
of high-priced English “stars”—many of whom
are execrable and only boom because they are
English—left many a good artist stranded. Mr,
Burford grew old and dropped out of the running,
and audiences ceased to howl for him when the
painted drop-scene went down, and presently he
was forgotten. And now, being unemployed and
extremely poor, he appeals for assistance in the
shape of a benefit or otherwise —a matter which
ought to be easily arranged. The people of
Sydney are always ready to give a tremendous
send-off to the departing star who is rich
and successful and doesn’t need a benefit ;
surely they will do something for the actor who
needs one badly, and who missed being a star
because he never learned the science of advertis-
ing. Any donations forwarded per medium of
The Bulletin will be duly forwarded to Mr.
Burford and gratefully acknowledged. We trust
this opportunity to lay up treasure in Heaven—if
there is such a place - will not be overlooked.

“A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” with its
sweet scenery, clever effects, and human weak-
nesses, is not suffering from a surfeit of prosperity
at Melbourne Princess’s. Even the sworn
followers of tha Bard are somewhat lax in their
allegiance, otherwise the theatre must have been
filled on the opening night. Those who avoid
Shakespearean plays unless an exceptionally
strong cast of players tempts them to sit at the
Master's cold feet are obviously delivered from
temptation in this instance. Nothing short of all-
round excellence will make a performance of
poetic drama boom in these hard, prosaic times,
and the Rignoldian show is not more remarkable
for beauties visible than for the rude shocks it
administers to the imagination. Helen and
Hermia are not realised by Miss Blanche Lewis
and Miss Athena Claudius, whose only quali-
fications for their parts exist in their respec-
tive heights. The love-affairs of these ladies
excite no interest. Miss Watts -Phillips, as
Oberon, is an acceptable figure of the fairy
monarch, yet she, in common with many other
people, makes a pantomimic pause at the end of
each line and emphasises her adjectives in a
mannerpast all mortal understanding. Heravowcd
knowledge of “a bank whereon the wild thyme
grows ” would seem to indicate that thyme is care-
fully planted and cultivated on banks in general,
and that the discovery of the fragrant herb in its
natural state is a matter for special mention.
Little Mabel Russell, on the other hand, speaks
verse trippingly and on the tongue, but doesn’t
put a sharp edge on her words and is not always
distinct. As for Miss Hilda Spong, her faults of
diction in the quarrel with Oberon are outweighed
by an airy fairy charm of manner that makes
Titaniaarealcreation all the time. George Rignold’s
work as Bottom, with and without the ass’s head,
gets funnier every night, and although the
Weaver and his brother clowns don’t all of them
hide the fact that they are playing the fool with
intention—notably the Thisbe of the interlude—
they certainly manage to amuse. Also, the inci-
dental fairies are improving on their first attempt.
The singing is more satisfactory, and a number of
splay-footed infants flaunt tiieir tootsies in the
limelight less obtrusively than they did a week
ago. A ballet in the first act pleases everybody
and should serve to attract those poor johnnies
who are at present lamenting the loss of a different
variety of leg-show.

At Melbourne Royal they have been doing
comparatively big business with “The Trumpet
Call,” wherefore that thin, unsatisfactory excuse
for a lavish display of scenery and histrionic talent
was carried over for a second week. Familiarity
with “The Trumpet Call ” breeds more contempt
for the hollow absurdity of the husband, who tears
himself away from his second wife and dreams of
her in exile for seven long years, instead of getting
a divorce from the abandoned female, whose black
shadow could be swept out of bis path by a decree
nisi at any minute. The impossibility of this
military drama is very wearisome, hut it gives
artists like Kate Bishop and Kdith Blande a
chance to make powerful displays of acting in
strong contrast, and they excite fitful bursts of
enthusiasm accordingly. On Saturday, another
of Bland Holt’s dramas will keep the ball rolling,
and give more pleasure to the usual crowded
house.

“ Turned Up,” the first, and probably the
funniest, comedy produced by the B. & B. firm,
was revived at Melbourne Bijou on Saturday.
None of the pristine fire was burned out of this
first-class joke. Carraway Bones is an undertaker
who does credit to the acknowledged humour of
Lis profession, and the weeping widow who meets
him during Ids summer holiday (whena falling-off
in the death-rate causes undertakers to seek con-
solation in the tender passion) and dries her tears
upon Ids limp black hair is a type of humanity
that will never be dead and buried. The ancient
mariner with a weakness for coming back from a
watery grave and a bluff, hearty tendency to
canoodle amongst the heathen, whilst his
heart remains true to Poll, is another immortal
incident. Everybody else in “Tinned Up”
possesses a backbone of human inti rest, with
the exception of an obstructive military person
whose time is mostly occupied by (matching a
fond daughter from the arms of a theatrical critic.
Under the circumstances it is impossible to express
anything but contempt and loathing for sued a
parent. Most of the originals fill their old place?,
and the performance is in several respects smarter
than ever. Lawrence is right out of his line as
the ancient mariner, but he makes up well and
suits himself to circumstances satisfactorily.
“ Turned Up ” was only brought out for a week’s
run, more’s the pity ! and on Saturday there is to
be a first Australian production of Pinero's latest,
“ The Times.”

Mrs. Bernard Boere and Co. duly came
back to the Opera House on Saturday, and started
to farewell m “Adrienne Lecouvrenr,” which
lugubrious tragedy was a subject of Sydney notice
quite recently, and is too sad to be further dwelt
upon. Mrs. Beero appeared to give her audience
the greatest delight when she was least excellent,
whilst Mr. Otho Stuart gave very little pleasure
to all at any time in particular. Adrienne has
now died for the last time, however, and De Saxe
is of no more consequence. To-night (Thursday)
they will revive the bright memory of “Masks
and Paces,” and on Monday another change of
bill will occur.

The Alexandra is still under the majestic
sway of Alf. Boothman. On Saturday a crowded
gallery whistled away at “ The Plying Scud,” and
a presumably triumphant run of the sporting
drama in question was only temporarily inter-
rupted on Monday night, when two men engaged
the theatre for a wrestling-match in theTcatch-as-
catch-can style. A number of other shows pro-
gress as usual, and another Fighting Kangaroo is
putting up his “ docks” at the Waxworks.

Dr.mpier’s benefit gave the Melbourne dailies a chance
to recognise generously’their business obligations to one
who had been a real good advertisement customer for
some years past. The Age- rebated 25 per cent, of the
usual charge on ads. relating to Hie Dampier matinee, the
Herald allowed 50 percent., the Standard inserted them
gratis, and the Argus loftily declined to make any con-
cession whatever.
Hilda Spong, as Titania, is sometimes a sweet reminder
of how Ellen Terry used to look.
The demise of his comrade, Florence, has deepened
Jefferson’s constitutional melancholy. Even in Melbourne,
29 years ago, he used to declare he was in a galloping
consumption, but he was then a recent widower. He has
been so melancholy that they even had to push him on
from the wings, for “Rip Van Winkle’’—and he’s a
millionaire.
From Australian Christian World, June 16, 1892:
“ A member of 48 years’ standing complains bitterly that
at the Ann-street Wesleyan Church, Brisbane, at what is
called a 1 People’s Service,’on Sunday evening, a lady of
the opera and other public artistes prominently took part
in the service.”
Hobart is suffering from too much music. At a recent
conceit, 150 performers played and sang to an audience
of 40.
To divorce your wife: Send her on to the stage and

rest will be easy.
Janet Aohurch, in a Pall Mall Gazette interview,
gushes over the people of Auckland (M.L.), where, in one
night, "300 bouquets were thrown on the stage.” An
Auckland paper brutally suggests that there were only-
ten bouquets, but each one was thrown thirty times.
Miss Harrie Ireland, without a doubt, is the most pro-
mising of native actresses now on the Australian stage.
Already a fine-looking girl, Miss Harrie will he an im-
posing creature anon. She suits her facial expression lo
the word, speaks as earnestly and prettily as she looks,
and is a magnetic young charmer to boot. In fact, if she
continues to keep her classical little head, and doesn’t
try to force herself into’more notice than she naturally
attracts, and avoids the usual pitfalls of the purfesh, there
should be a very bright future for George Ireland's
daughter.

Sara Bernhardt says that actors, as a general rule, should

London critics continue ,to condemn the “rough and
tumble audiences and inexperienced critics, who cannot
appreciate refined art,” of Australia, for Janet Achurch’s
‘exaggerated gestures, hysterical noises” and general
inequality of art, acquired, as they state, since leaving
London. It is true that Miss Achurch’s methods did
alter for the worse while she was here, but also true that
the audiences and critics of Australia saw and deplored
the change which was due, not to them, but to the fact

In an Australian stage obituary, given by one of our

Looking at the original hill of the opening of Melbourne
Royal, 1855, we reflected that a skilled actuary could tell,
within a little, how many of the 3300 spectators were still
alive. People talk of the dissipation of the theatrical
profession, but we have reason to believe that at least
four performers out of the 20 who played in the “ School
for Scandal ” that night, 37 years ago, are still alive, nor
were any of Ihese youthful at the time. The four are,
C. Walsh, II. N. Warner, Burford, and Mrs. O. Poole —we
are open to correction, and are almost certain there are
oilier survivors of the cast. Compare this again with the
survival of Stewart, Jefferson, Ireland, Harwood, Glad-
stone, Dolly Green, and others, from the Melbourne oast
of “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” 29 years ago, nigh the
lapse of a generation.

Piemining, in London, recalls to an interviewer how

stage-play that we recall was in a piece acted by Mav
Howard in Australia called “Solid Silver,” wherein a
good man, Thespianly clothed in samite, fetched dow n
the drop-curtain on his reading a rather lengthy passage.

At a certain Sydney theatre the ghost wouldn’t walk on
a recent pay-day.
The great fault of all Sydney theatres is the cramming
of seats together, in a way which makes it impossible to
sit iu comfort. The Government should make a regula-
tion, fixing the distance between seats at not less than
3ft., which gives enough room for people to pass in front
of others who are seated, without shin-knocking or corn-
torturing.
It is said that litigation threatens between Hie owners

An up-country Darby and Joan determined to spend
their first night in Melbourne at the tattooed man’s levde.
A wag directed them to the Town Hall, where Fob and
Orlando Harley were warbling. After the great basso, his
fidus Achates tenor, and one or two local people had done
a turn, the old lady rose majestically in the middle of
Fob’s best note and exclaimed, “Darby, there’s some-
tiling wrong here.” “ Ilish-h-h !” said the audience.
“But when’s Horaopavd coming on?” asked the exas-
perated female, and then turning to her old man she
protested, “ Come on out of this—it’s a concert.”
“ Hish-h-h ! sit down,” hissed the populace. But the old
pair filed out in disgust, Joan, as she got* clear of the
seats, firing this parting shot—“An ordinary concert !
Why, we have ’em in Warragul every night of’the week 1
Come on, Darby !”

It was dead Derbin Willder who first

Ex-Captaia Yerney, just released from

will “labour earnestly to redeem the errors of the

already, and most of them labour earnestly with
an eye-glass, and sit on the Post Office steps wait-

The captain of a Northern coasting steamer
was venting his stock of expletives on a careless

steam to escape. When he had done he found
Bishop Stanton quietly standing by and apologised
abjectly. Whereupon the Bishop lifted his hand
and said, with a reverend twinkle in his eye :
“ Very bad, but quite excusable under the cir-
cumstances, however.” Stanton was never
orthodox except once when he took off his coat
and helped a gang of blacklegs to load sugar.
A story with a moral. When Harcus was
editorof S.A. Advertiser he was writing a series of
anonymous personal - political articles which
attracted much attention. An intimate friend on
one occasion persistently pressed him to reveal the
authorship, and pledged himself to utter secrecy.
For long Harcus refused to tell, but as he left he
whispered in the ear of his interrogator: “The
Bishop !” and then hurried away, so that his grin
might not betray the pious fraud. Before that
day was over everyone in Adelaide had been
informed that Dr. Short was responsible for the
articles in question.
The Australasian, speaking of Premier
Dibbs, remarks that “ it is a pleasant thing to see
that the Premier of an Australian colony is
received in London as a man of mark, as a dis-
tinguished Englishman, and most people will hope
that this feeling will long exist.” The poor old
Australasian nearly breaks its back every week
trying to be English, and its one idea of joy is to
be received as “a distinguished Englishman.”
Only, as it happens, Dibbs is entirely and abso-
lutely Australian, and if he can be received as an
Englishman what’s to hinder the editor of the
Australasian being greeted, when he goes to
England, as an eminent Chinese gentleman ?
H. M. Stanley, may consider himself
utterly, finally, and irrevocably snuffed out. His
Darkest Africa (about which he knows less than
many a Dutch Boer who has explored the interior
single-handed) is being abandoned by the nations
who scrambled for possession of it, and when he
put up for Lambeth the other day his “ fascina-
ting personality ” was a magnet for all the stale
eggs in the borough. For more than 20 years
Stanley contrived to be a famous man in the
estimation of a world which had only read of him
in newspapers, or in books written by himself.
When he and his achievements came under im-
mediate notice, the world pretty soon discovered
that there had been nothing extraordinary about
this bolstered-up buccaneer with the exception of
his liver, and now that his liver has gone bung
and theSmythes of civilisation have squeezed him
dry, he is fast subsiding into the position of Dolly
Tennant’s husband.

Lord’s day, and a good part of Monday was put
in by the elated populace at one of the caravan-
serais.
Somebody advertises in the Sydney
Evening News offering <£1 for the address of an
individual described as, “Richard Fagan, 20,
stout, fair, shakes his nose.” There is a vagueness
about this description which reminds us of that
epistle which once turned up at the London dead-
letter office addressed' “ Mrs. Smith, at the back
of the church, England.” Does Fagan shake his
nose with his finger, or does he shake his head
along with it, or is it so weak that it shakes in the
wind without moving his other features? And, in
the latter ease, is Fagan related in any way to
that coastal captain we once knew, who used to
irritate us at the saloon dining-table by moving
his scalp back and forward while he kept his head
perfectly motionless? It used to be an awful
thing to sit at dinner with that captain, for if you
addressed him suddenly he would give a start anti
jerk his scalp two inches on one side before he
answered you, and sometimes he would remove all
his hair over to one ear, and then twitch it back
again quite suddenly. One night a drunken bag-
man jnade a bet in tin- smoking-room that he
could do the same, and then he dislocated his ear
and broke a blood-vessel in the attempt. The old
captain was drowned at last in a wreck, and his
remains were buried decently in a lonesome
cemetery with his moveable scalp cocked on one
side, and presenting a mournfully ridiculous
spectacle.

Academy of Arts, Australia.
FIRST EXHIBITION.
Some months ago a few members seceded
from the N.S.W. Art Society with the intention
of settingup on their own account. The motive that
governed the seceders may have sprung from a
desire to improve Australian arc culture, or it may
have been disappointed vanity that prompted the
movement. Whatever the reason, “ the Academy
of Arts, Australia,” was formed, and the first
exhibition of pictures by the Academicians and
their friends was opened in Sydney on Saturday
week. The public are thus now in a position to
answer the only question they have any interest in
asking—namely, has the Academy established its
right to exist ? An impartial critic, glancing
round the walls, can only reply to this by an
emphatic negative.
* * *
The collection is small, consisting of 160
contributions in all, and although here and there
can be found one or two works worthy of con-
sideration, the average'standard is decidedly low.
As a matter of fact, a stranger visiting this
gallery under the impression that he would find
there material from which he could obtain an
idea of the state of art in Australia, or even in
N.S. Wales, would carry away very misleading
views on the subject. Even of the 13 Acade-
micians only a small proportion have sent pictures,
and some of these are not so good as vve had a
right to expect from their previous performances,
while scarcely any of the contributions from out-
siders are above mediocrity, and some are
unquestionably below it.
* * »
The oil-paintings number 78, ana if the
Hanging Committee had exercised a wise dis-
cretion there would have been still fewer. Mr.
W. H. Howes, an academician, sends no less than
ten canvases, all of them alleged to be views of
places in and around Sydney. Mr. Howes (take
his “Entrance to Heads from Bondi” as an
example) is evidently fond of laying on the colour
with a palette-knife. This method maybe pardon-
able in a Constable or a Courbet, but is certainly
not justifiable when followed by artists of Mr.
Howes’s calibre.
• # •
Mr. Nicholas Shiels is another voluminous
exhibitor, contributing 13 works in oils and water-
Of the former the best is undoubtedly
“ The Nurse ” (60), which shows careful work and
a just appreciation of the value of the grey lones in
which it is painted. His study of a dejected-looking
lion, “Garfield 11.*'(4), is powerful, but the drawing
is not above suspicion, while “Once bitten twice
shy ” (30), a woman pouring water into a bath-
tub on the edge of which a child is poised in an
impossible position, lacks finish, the arms and
hands of the boy being excessively weak,
“Grannie” (64), by the same artist, should not
have been exhibited ; and his portrait of a gentle-
man (74) is a distinct failure, the painting being
hard and the colour crude, to say nothing of the
bad drawing of the hand. The best specimen of
his work sent by Mr. G. P. Nerli is his portrait of
a lady in a dark-blue dress (which we believe lias
been exhibited before). This has decided charac-
ter, and tiie treatment is broad and effective with-
out being “sloppy.” No. 64 (-■ Ardagh, Esq.), a
representation of a dude-like gentleman, attired
in faultless clothes, is clever, and there is chic in
the treatment of the slight sketch of Signor
Ferrari (65). Mr. Nerli lias also here several small
landscape studies—mere experiments in colour,
executed with a facile brush, but not possessing
any particular interest. Mr. J. W. Stone excels
in the painting of still life, and his group of fruit
and crockeryware (62) is a careful and conscien-
tious piece of work. His landscapes, on the other
hand, are hot in colour, without being brilliant—a
distinction well understood by artists, although
there is some merit in a simple little study of sun-
light and shade in “ The Silent Cell, in the Model
Prison, Port Arthur.” Mrs. Louise Stone has sent
several pictures of fruit and flowers, the most suc-
cessful being a group of winter flowers (55), in which
the delicate greys are well harmonised. Mr. J.
Lamb Lyon appears at his best in the Triptych (9)
an altar-piece of theconventionallydecorativekind
but he is most decidedly out of his element in his
easel pictures. His portrait of a lady (23) is com-
monplace, while his more ambitious venture
“ Preparing for the Dog Show ” is infinitely
worse, the animal being the most extraordinary
specimen of the canine race we have ever come
across. There is no need to say much about the
rest of the oil-paintings, which, as we have said
are by no means up to the not very high standard
of Australian art. Here and there are to be found
some signs of promise, as for instance in Miss M.
H. A. Simpson’s “Placid Enjoyment” (41), a
portrait of a gentleman lounging in a chair, but in
the majority of instances the artists have not
passed beyond the amateur or student stage, and
it was a mistaken kindness for the Hanging Com-
mittee to give their productions a place on the
walls of the Exhibition.
# * *
Passing from the oil paintings to the
water-colours we find ourselves among far more
satisfactory surroundings. In the first place, the
President, Mr. P. Fletcher Watson, to whose
enthusiasm the establishment of the Academy is
mainly due, is himself a tower of strength in this
department. It is true that the field in which lie
works is small, but his skill in that field is un-
doubted, Mr. Watson has never done anything
better than his “Festival of Flora—Burgos
Cathedral ” (86), the architecture being drawn with
a scholarly hand, and the work solid and sincere
throughout, although the perspective is somewhat
suggestive of a photograph. The light is admirably
managed, and there is true dignity in the figure
surmounting the grille behind which the pro-
cession is seen passing along. Scarcely less good
is the “Procession of Cardinals, Abbey of St.
Denis, Paris” (94), the only fault to be found
being in the drawing of the figures, which,
however, occupy but a subsidiary position
in the picture. Mr. Watson’s other con-
tributions consist principally of landscape
sketches, executed with facility but not
possessing any special distinctive features. Mr.
E. B. Boulton, a veteran artist, a little old-
fashioned, perhaps, but possessing a style founded
on the sound principles laid down by David Cox
and other great English aquarellists, has sent four
drawings, all of them showing excellent qualities,
especially “Gibraltar from the Spanish Side”
(103). Of Mr. Nicholas Shiels’ water-colours, we
prefer his “Mermaid Street, Rye” (102), a view
of a quaint thoroughfare in the old English sea-
port town, a subject he appears to be more in
sympathy with than he is with the landscapes of
this country. His picture entitled “ A Message
from the Sea ”(106), a couple of children digging
in the sand, is decidedly faulty in the drawing,
particularly in the case of the boy squatting on
his haunches. _ Mr. W. Selby Fotheringham, a
recent arrival in Australia, shows a very clever
study of autumn tints in his “Deeside, Scotland”
(117), and should be an acquisition to the band of
Australian artists. Perhaps the most interesting
portion of this section of the Exhibition—and,
indeed, of the whole show—is to be found in the
drawings sent by a well-known English artist,
Mr. Walter Severn, President of the Dudley
Gallery. These consist of five large drawings,
depicting scenes in different parts of Great
Britain; all his effects are most carefully
studied, his results are obtained with-
out the slightest attempt at “ niggling.”
Note especially the masterly treatment of the
shifting sand in the admirable drawing of “ Golf
Links Company (109), where the effect is reached,
evidently by the most simple means. Among the
small collection of black and white drawings, the
only contribution calling for even passing notice
is a clever charcoal sketch of a girl’s head by Mr.
Nerli; the nude studies of Mr. Fotheringham are
certainly not suitable for exhibition in a public
gallery. Some decorative designs from the studios
of Messrs. Wells and Lyon, and a few archi-
tectural drawings of eminently commonplace
buildings, with a solitary specimen of the sculp-
tor’s art in the shape of Dr. M'Carthy’s study of
Sarah Bernhardt, in terracotta, complete the
catalogue of an exhibition which cannot be re-
garded as, on the whole, up to the average, nor is
it in any way representative of Australian art.

Generally the poor newspaper editor is
overlooked in schemes of social reform, but a
witness before the S.A. Factories Commission
wants these lambs duly shepherded. He asked
that the Factory Inspectors should be empowered
to see that editors didn’t work more than eight
hours per day, and to order the holding-over of
any leading article if he believed it was written in
overtime. Another witness thought it would be a
good thing for Parliament to abolish morning
papers, and to compel all papers to be published
in the evening, so as to do away with night-
work.

sport a mace nor does the Speaker wear a wig.
Away with the baubles !
Chamberlain, it is cabled, says it’s sad to
sr-e Gladstone degenerate into a mob orator.
Chamberlain has only become a snob-orator.
Ash has i' Bill before S.A. Parliament to
raise payment of members from <£2oo to <£3oo a
year at a total extra annual expense of £6lOO.
A Mount Gambler (S.A.) parson recently
prayed that “Members of Parliament may be
made just commonly honest as other men are.”
N.S.W. Treasury calls for tenders fo r
printing half-a-million promissory note forms-
This looks as if Parkes were returning to power.

mean compared with his profits.”— Walter
Besant.
In the past six years, England made
£66,258 by furnishing Victoria with silver coin-
age, while Victoria lost £29,994 by coining its
own gold.
In the Maoriland House of Representa-

against the introduction of black labour into
Australia.
Next year let us commence a proper
Fourth of July celebration as Australians. Let
all the Republicans meet —Americans, French,
Swiss, Australians.
All the old Cathedral cities in England
returned Tories this election time. Few Radicals,
indeed, are hardy enough to live in an atmosphere
of Dean and Chapter.
More “ silken thread !” Men of irre
proachable character who have served 18 years

Regard the falsity of a system under
which Goldbng Davies is elected Speaker, merely

Mr. S. D. Phelps, Counsollor-at-law of the
U.S., who is in Sydney on business, says: “No

One Labour man in House of Commons.
Rejoicing—because there is only one, as with the
triumphal Victorian Government telegram to
London. One representative of Ten Millions! —
600 of the rest.
Agent-General Munro’s resistance to
Dibbs’ proposal that the French convict head-
quarters be shifted from New Caledonia to the
New Hebrides is doubtless prompted by the Pres-
byterian mission interest.
One of the things which helped to wreck
Parkes was his persistent neglect to answer official
correspondence. The Acting Colonial Secretary
of N.S.W., not having any particular love for
Parkes, doesn’t follow the old man’s example.
“ The only true measure of the wages of
productive labour is, in addition to the cost of
subsistence, an adequate and fair proportion of the
new wealth produced by labour.”—Sir Samuel
Griffith (the old Sam Griffith, not the Kanakil-
griff).
Colonial Secretary Tozer stated in answer
to an enquiry in the Queensland Assembly that
£lBO per week was distributed as relief amongst
900 families of the local unemployed. Exactly
four shillings per family per week. And yet they
growl.
It is considered likely that S.A. Assembly
will decide in favour of Parliarnentarily-Elective
Ministers with a start from the beginning of next
session. The Progressive Wealth Tax is also
expected immediately after the general election
next year.
The Holder (S.A.) Government intended
to include Women’s Suffrage in their policy, but
tanked it at the last moment, whereat the irate
females (with a contingent of clergymen) have
stormed Cockburn. Four out of the six Ministers
nave openly supported the principle.
It is a significant fact that most of the
Jest country in West Australia is owned or
leased by members of that province’s present
Parliament. Public roads and railways have been
constructed so as to enhance the value of these
public fakings by many thousands per cent.
From Australian Star leader :
Accompanied by several members of the Opposition,

Caldwell is the poet of the S.A, Parlia-
ment. The silver-tongued orator of the Assembly
is Parsons, while the best speaker of the Parlia-
ment is Gordon at present in the Upper House,
but who is to oppose Playford at next general
election. Gordon is the genius of the Holder
Cabinet.
Sir Henry Parkes last week presided over
a Sydney meeting to advocate the franchise to
women. The meeting opened with a hymn and
prayer !!! And one of the lady-speakers pro-
mised that if Parkes helped them he would return
to power and the women would crown him with
aurtls.
“The ominous word “corruption” is very
much in use by Tasmanians at present, in connec-
tion with a recent civil action in which the
defendant—a Tasmanian legislator—admitted that
he had received as a gift paid-up shares in a
mining company whilst that company’s claims
were before Parliament.
The cable that the Irish hospitals are full
of wounded men as a result of election-time, recalls
the yarn about the Irish barrister who asked the
doctor whether he would swear that deceased’s
skull was very thin? “Yes,” was the reply.
“ An’ pwhat roight d’ye think any man had at an
election matin’ wid a thin shkull?”
The Holder Ministry’s village settlement
scheme is on the freehold system, whereas the

QUARANTINED PARTY: “Look here, Doctor, you don’t think for a moment that I’ve taken
small-pox?”
DOCTOR: “Not yet, but you may if you stop here long enough.”
Maoriland schemes are perpetual leases. In S.
Australia, unless carefully provided for, the land-
boodlers will eventually run the show, and the
“settler ” will go to the wall. “To give settlers the
freehold,” says Ballauce, “ would be disastrous to
the scheme.”
N.S.W. Agent-General, Sir Saul Samuel,
it is stated, resents Premier Dibbs’ interference in
London, and refuses to meet him privately or
otherwise. This sounds very unlikely; but if it be
true, the venerable and ordinarily courteous Saul
is enabled to take the haughty position by the
fact that Parkes appointed him not as an ordinary
removable Agent-General, but as a pensionable
Civil-servant.
The case between the N.S.W. Government
and the contractor for the Bare Island fort has
been settled, and defendant is to pay .£1441 17s. 4d.
(and a few thousands in liwyets’ costs) for the
shortcomings in his ramshackle fortification.
What will become of the paralytic tower isn't
stated, but if it isn't intended that it shall fail in
and squash its defenders in time of peace it will
require to be pulled down and rebuilt. The
country that is defended by contract has a poor
show.
“Andy” Kelly—the Labour-member who
said, “ You will never see Andy Kelly in a plug
hat”—drove round Sydney, the other day, in a
borrowed buggy getting subscriptions for the
relief of the destitute. The “Count” couldn’t
quite make out why ho was received everywhere
with such roars of laughter until he looked back
and saw an old bell-topper bounding along at the
rear of his chariot tied to the axle by a piece of
cord.
The one logical Single-taxer The Bulletin
knows is P. R. Meggy, late Secretary to N.S.W.
Strike Commission. At boom-time, he was asked
to join in a land-speculation with several other
Single-taxers, the transaction to be financed by
another Single-taxer, Meggy declined on the
irrefragable ground that no Single-taxer could
morally go in for gambling in land-values. The
Bulletin hears this from a Single-taxer who did
gamble in land-values.
Nearly a million of Government money is
locked up in the Queensland banks —principally
in the Q.N. It belongs to the people who receive
4 per cent, per annum as interest from the financial
institutions, who let it out in turn at from 7 to
15 per cent. The money cannot be withdrawn —
the times have become too critical. Therefore, the
banker capitalists actually rook the Queensland
people of from <£30,000 to £llO,OOO per annum ;
that is, the difference between the rate of interest
paid and the rate they receive.
The One-man-one-vote discussion in Bris-
bane Parliament was a tame affair. The plural
voters gave but little trouble to Hansard —a few
platitudes, and a loud “No!” on the question
being put. Hoolan asked why the poet, Brunton
Stephens, should have less votes than the fat and
gilded butcher, Billy Pattison, if plural votes were
to be allowed. The division resulted in 43 noes
and 11 ayes. The masses of Australia may yet
have to fight for one-man-one-vote, the natural
franchise, the birthright of every freeman.
Pope Leo XIII. has confounded the French
royalists by declaring in diplomatic language that
the voice of the Republic is the voice of God, and
the Divine Right of Kings is of no consequence in
countries where they don’t reign. The significance
of this Papal manifesto is broad and deep. His
Holiness is prepared to bless Home Rule in Ire-
land when it comes to pass, but in the meantime
Ids refusal to sanction priestly interference in the
matter will call attention to the bigotry of the
Protestant bishops when they vote en masse
against Gladstone’s bill.
Apropos a recent libel-action, it is about
time the presiding judge eschewed making that
absurd inference that a public man (we are now
not speaking of individuals but of a judicial
theory) may do exactly what ha pleases outside
Ids office or after dark/ Within certain limits the
life of any person occupying a position of trust,
responsibility, or honour, concerns that person’s
employers or constituents. A judge, say. may be
a sound, painstaking lawyer, but if he be a
notorious roue and an associate of libertines and
harlots, is the fact to be ignored ? It is a pernicious
plea to recognise, that a public man is entitled to
two lives—one on, the other off, the stage. The
man who can be a thief in his private life can also
be a thief as a member of Parliament.
Night Shift.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Hello ! there’s the whistle, be moving.
Wake up ! don’t be muttering there.
What language ! your style is improving—
It’s pleasant jto hear you at prayer.
Turn out, doff the rug, slide from under—
Crib’s cut, and the tea’s on the brew ;
It’s raining and storming like thunder,
And that was the half-hour that blew.”
“ Half-past! and the night’s simply awful,
The hut fairly shakes in the storm.
Hang night-shifts ! They shouldn’t be lawful;
I’ve only had time to get warm,
I notice the hut’s rarely bright, and
The bunk’s always cold as a stone,
Except when I go on at night, and
The half-after whistles have blown.
“You built up that fire just to nark me ;
You ain't got a heart, swelp me bob !
Two pins and I’d throw over Markby,
And let him be blown with his job.
Heigh-ho I What’s that—who’s a croaker V
You’re all mighty good on the flute —•
I’ll knock half the bark off the joker
Who emptied tea-leaves in my boot!
“ Great Csesar ! you roasted the water,
Whoever it was made the tea ;
It’s hotter than Hades. Well, you oughter !
Fried bacon again. Not for me !
Good night, and be darned ! Stir up, Stumpy,
You look very happy and warm ;
I’ll just lift some bark off the humpy
And give you a taste of the storm.”
We laughed as he went away, growling.
Down where the wind whipped the creek.
The storm like old fury was howling,
And Fred was on top for the week.
“A devil’s own night for the braceman,”
Muttered Con. “ It’s a comfort to know
All weathers are one to the face man,
All shifts are alike down below.”
We slept, and the flames flickered dimly,
The embers a ruddy light shed,
When they came, stepping softly, and grimly
Laid Martin again on his bed.
His fair hair was dark now and gory,
The death-veil was grey on his face.
They whispered and told us the story,
’Tvvas short—he was blown from the brace.
EDWARD DYSON.
Two years ago, Cunnamulla (Q.) had a
leprous Chinaman; now it has a leprous black-
fellow.
The owner of a boat that sails round the
Beautiful Harbour with a patent medicine advt,
on her mainsail, gets £3 10s. per week commis-
sion.
T. Jones, undertaker, was fined in Mel-
bourne last week for furious driving—while cart-
ing off a nondescript corpse at contract rates.
“We always drive Government funerals quicker
than ordinary ones,” said Thomas. “Rattle his

The oldest “legislator” in Hingland is
the Earl of Lovelace, whose'first wife was the
daughter of Don Juan Byron. This Lovelace was
sworn into the House of Beers sixty years ago, and
when wheeled to the door in a bath-chair the
venerable geeser can swear in there now. Yet
several other peers are older in years, three —the
noble lords Essex, Ebury and Winmarleigh—
having already knocked up the awful total of 270
between them. The poor have no idea of how
these rich nonentities manage to live.
William M‘Carthy, of Melbourne, is a man
and a martyr. He is in gaol now, but there are
worse men in heaven, judging by the latest edition
of the saints-list. William was unemployed and
hungry, and when he had braced up to the last
hole in his belt he waxed desperate and determined
to get a meal; but, being a man of feeling, he
didn’t go alone. He took a couple of friends in
with him, and, assuming the haughty air of a
squatter with the season’s clip in his breast
pocket, lie ordered bash for three. The friends
went through all the courses, and then the
McCarthy paid the score with a copper dump. He
got three mouths, and he deserves it—gaol’s a
privilege nowadays. Nut one man in fifty would
have thought of letting his friends stand in under
similar circumstance-.
About nine months ago a small open boat
was picked up in Moreton Bay. It contained
two negroes —one of them being a woman of about
22 years of age, the other a middle-aged man in
the throes of death and speechless. The woman,
in answer to enquiries, said something that sounded
like “ Wish-e-nib,” but nothing more. They were
brought to Brisbane, and the man died in a few
hours from want and exposure. The woman
refused to leave him, and had to be removed by
main force, uttering doleful cries. From that
time she remained dumb. All expedients to make
her speak proved futile, and she was sent to the
aboriginal settlement on Bribie Island, but, as she
refused to consort or eat with the blacks there,
she was brought back to Brisbane. All sorts of
interpreters were tried, but she remained silent as
the grave and as passive. The authorities then
had her arrested as a vagrant, and Wish-e-nib, as
she was called, toed the mark every Monday
morning. No use. “ Wish-e-nib, you are charged
with being a vagrant.” No reply. Then, “Wish-
o-nib, you are remanded for one week.” No reply.
“Take her away”—and downstairs again she
went for another week. This farce was repeated
weekly for several months, and then the chill of
the prison struck her soul, and the unfortunate
creature fell ill, of no recognisable disease, but
simply pined away. She was taken to the hospi-
tal still speechless, fell weaker, and passed out
into the great beyond to join her companion in
the land of shades. It was almost as deep a
mystery as that of the Man in the Iron Mask.
From the day of her capture to the day she died,
not a- sound escaped her lips. It is more than
probable that the two were natives of New
Caledonia.

Gov. and Lady Jersey have taken a trip
to New Caledonia in that most magnificent and
comfortable of steamships, theM.M. Co. s Armand
Bohic. Lord and Lady J. seem in such a hurry
to visit the remote parts of N.S.W. and places
altogether outside the province, that people will
soon begin to think they don’t intend to serve out
their full term.
# # *
The Bulletin rises to prophesy that
Governor Jersey's visit to Noumea will be a sue*
cess. Good, old, unaffected Jersey, with his
carroty hair and his weeping whiskers and the
blush upon his nose, is the typical Englishman of
the Parisian comedies, and every Frenchman who
lias ever witnessed a Parisian comedy lives in the
hope of seeing this wildly comic islander in the
flesh before he dies. And when Jersey arrives-
especially if he arrives in a choclc-siiit and with
his pants turned up at the feet—several thousand
inhabitants will recognise him at once as John
Bull personified, and will feel very, very glad.

The caterer is no longer in demand at a
certain Government House. You see, the Queen’s
representative wished to give a garden-party some
little time back, and he asked the caterer how
much (100 chairs, three large marquees, fancy
refreshments and table ornaments would come to.
The feast fiend was quite prepared to lose <£4o or
o ver the job, on account of the ad., so he
magnanimously promised to “do it for a bob a
head, and properly, your Excellency.” The
garden-party duly came off, and the bill was
sent in. Next day His Excellency called on the
c tterer, and was ushered into the best parlour
where fiz. was opened. After some desultory chat
about the Cup weights and football and things
like that, the caterer was informed officially that
Ins charges should have been more moderate, and
that 6d. per guest would have been quite enough
in the way of a bill. Now, the disgusted pro-
vider, when telling this true story of the Charge
of the Six Hundred, adds, “’E evidently thought,
you know, that ’is guests would eat the chairs and the
marquees and the table hornyments as well as the
fancy tucker, an’ when ’e found that they didn t,
why ’e comes round to hask for discount hoff the
(vermilion) bill —but ’e didn’t get it.”

Not long since the only daughter of an old
and somewhat eccentric Sydney resident was
being courted by a young legal gentleman. “Pa”
was in the habit of nightly attending the club,
and a small plate of sandwiches was always left
on a hall table for his supper on his return. One
evening the legal man stayed rather late with his
beloved, and just ere he left the servant came
along and put the sandwiches on the sidetable.
Thinking it was a thoughtful little act on the part
of the household he immediately proceeded to
“ put away ” the sandwiches. He was just finish-
ing the last when the latchkey grated in the lock
and pa came in, and seeing his supper gone burst
into a torrent of abuse against the legal man, who
replied in eloquence more picturesque than
dignified. The upshot of the row was that a pros-
pective marriage in high life was suddenly broken
off, and a rich merchant lost one of the very best
dancers in Sydney for a son-in-law.

That graceful little song-bird, Lalla
Miranda, will shortly marry a medicine man

The New South Wales police aver that
a woman now under, committal kept a regu-
lar baby farm. Within two years she got
four of “love's impediments” from a suburban
lying-in home, the infants belonging respectively
to girls from Wagga, Urana, Brisbane, and Mait-
land. Three of these died, and naturally the
sympathy of neighbours went out to the “bereaved
parents,” as accused was living with an eligible-
looking male person. There used to be periodi-
cally a mock confinement at her cottage, and
whenever an infant was smuggled in from the
suburban emporium, she would “lay up,” as Wales
said in writing to Lady Mordaunt, Neighbours
thought the interesting events were rather
frequent, but nothing wrong was suspected until
the local registrar began to regard her as a perfect
phenomenon. # #
Melbourne University ball was held in the
local Town Hall last week. This annual function
only once startled the populace to any serious
extent. That was when some gay young spark
invited the leading ladies of the first Gaiety Co.
to come in for a whirl after their show. They all
came, of course, and created a terrible sensation
among the Toorakites present, while the South
Yarrakins were delighted. But none of the Co.
could be induced to dance. They had had enough
of that, they said, with rippling laughter, at the
blanky show for three blooming hours, and would
oe exceedingly obliged if deah Johnny would
lead the way to the suppah. The Co. were gone
for a considerable time, and when they returned
Vinvitation pour la valse was quite unnecessary.
They danced then irrepressibly and with a rollick-
ing disregard for appearances. They’d have
danced till breakfast only the gathering thinned
rapidly before the thermometer became too ele-
vated, and the ball stopped suddenly. No one
had wit enough this year to ask Alice Leamar to
flounce suddenly in with her Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay
pas seal! On the morning after another
University ball people coming into town stopped
to watch the antics of a judge’s son on the roof of
a hotel near the Town Hall. The effect of his
capers was heightened by the fact that he had on
only some of his pyjamas.

Dr. Renwick, N.S.W. Commissioner to
Chicago Exhibition, who, poor thing, is keen on
getting a title, did not resign one of his numerous
official positions before leaving Sydney, from
which lie will probably be absent two years. He
should certainly not have been allowed to retain
the Presidentship of Sydney Hospital—an office
the duties of which, especially in the present
critical state of affairs, demand unremitting atten-
tion on the part of the institution’s chief executive
officer.

Rather funny that the Radical Kingston

of the family.” The iaith that was in Wa> •
when he expected to breathe his last gave place to
harrowing suspicions, and his days in the land are
now devoted, or so he states, to discovering Mrs.
Wall misconducting herself with a cabman.
Consequently, he upbraids the lady, who in return
asserts her position as a property-holder by hitting
him over the head with her own chairs ana
crockery. Furthermore, the alleged object of the
lady’s unhallowed passion attacks Wall with nW
mouth, and causes him to remark that a wife s
ingratitude is not sharper than a cabman’s tooth.

On your ghastly cheek, or your sunken eye—
Better to know you were dead.
You loved me once, I know,
You love me still, I believe ;
But you might as well be among the clouds.
Or in rocky cavern under the sea,
For all you can ever be now to me.
Madman and fool was I,
What wonder you turned from me—
What wonder you turned to a true heart s love
To soothe the wounds that my madness caused,
And heal the heart that I broke.
Thrice cursed fool was I
Whilst you gave your heart to me,
And your love shone out like a beacon light,
I followed like idiot, a wandering star.
Wedded and dead to me,
The stars may fall to the earth,
Spirits return to the loves they loved,
And angels from heaven may visit hell;
But, my love, you will never come back to me.

Dear Bulletin, —Lee Sing supplied the
diggers at Cowbail Flat with vegetables. More-
over, he was the proud possessor of a house, a
wife, a baby, and last—tho’ not least —an oven.
This yarn deals with the baby and the oven.
Occasionally it snows at Cowbail Flat, also fire-
wood is scarce. Now, naturally, Lee Sing didn’t
want a fire burning in his abode all night. But
he thought the oven would be a “ welly ni’ places
put litty boy.” Accordingly, one cold night Lee
Sing, junior, was dumped down in the oven and
the door closed upon him. Perhaps Mrs. L. S.
overlooked the fact that she had been baking,
perhaps—but :In the morning, when the Chow
opened the door, he beheld a “grinning, grizzled
object, nicely roasted.” Says Lee Sing: “ Wha’
foh you laugh ? ’Cos you see your father?” There
is a report at Cowbail Flat that Lee Sing’s first-
born “ fell down a well.”— Tyn K.

T ITTERATEUR desires assistance of young LADY
or GENTLEMAN of literary aptitudes and
faculty, and commanding some leisure, in preparing
work for press ; ten hours weekly for one year. No
present remuneration; remuneration will be half
contingent profits.
The first individual apparently lives on the two-
penny stamps forwarded by grocery boys out of
work, and the second fiend wants to get the loan
of some girl who has “literary aptitudes,” and
make her write a book for him, and will then put
his name to it, and give her half the profits which
are left after he has audited the accounts in his
own fashion, or else he may simply throw
her out and repudiate the agreement. The
aspirant who gets the billet is sure to be a
girl, for a male person would be almost certain
to whale the litterateur if the “contingent
profits ” weren’t forthcoming, and they are
not likely to be the author who adver-
tises for somebody to write his book for him
generally has a row over the profits at the end, or
else he skips out of the province, or files his
schedule, or something. And now what The
Bulletin wants to know is this : Are the grocery
speculator and the literary genius both the same,
and is the literary man living on the twopenny-

medium of the lady of literary aptitudes, and is he

The Second Fleet:
(A CHAPTER FROM THE N.S.W. RECORDS)
THE REV. R. JOIINSON TO MR. THORNTON.
[Exlracl.]
The Lady Juliana brought out from England 226 women
convicts, out of which she had only buried five, though
they had been on board for about 15 months. The case
was much otherwise with the other three ships.
There were on board—
Died Sick
on board, landed.
The Neptune, 520 ... ... .. 163 269
The Scarborough, 252 .. .. 68 06
The Surprise, 211 42 121
The short calculation or account given me will account
for what I am going to relate.
Have been on board these different ships. Was first on
board the Surprise. Went down amongst the convicts,
where I beheld a sight truly shocking to the feelings of
humanity, a great number of them laying, some half and
others nearly quite naked, without either bed or bedding,
unable to turn or help themselves. Spoke to them as I
passed along, but the smell was so offensive that I could
scarcely bear it. I then went on board the Scarborough ;
proposed to go down amongst them, but was dissuaded
from it by the captain. The Neptune was still more
wretohed and intolerable, and therefore never attempted
it. Some of these unhappy people died after the ships
came into the harbour, before they could be taken on
shore—part of these had been thrown into the harbour,
and their dead bodies cast upon the shore, and were seen
laying naked upon the rocks. Took an occasion to repre-
sent this to His Excellency, in consequence of which
immediate orders were sent on board that those who died
on board should be carried to the opposite North Shore
and be buried. The landing of these people was truly
affecting and shocking ; great numbers were not able to
walk, nor to move hand nor foot: such were slung over
the ship side in the same manner as they would sling a
cask, a box, or anything of that nature. Upon their being
brought up to the open air some fainted, some died upon
deck, and others in the boat before they reached the
shore. When come on shore many were not able to walk,
to stand, or to stir themselves in the least, hence some
were led by others. The next thing to he considered was
what was to be done with all these miserable objects?
Besides the sick that were in the hospital previous to the
arrival of the fleet, there were now landed not less than
486 sick ; but the hospital erected here is not sufficient to
hold above 60 or 80 at most; what then must he done
with the rest? It was fortunate that a new hospital was
brought out in the Justinian. This was set up with all
speed ; a great number of tents, in all 90 or 109, were
pitched. In each of these tents there were about four sick
people ; here they lay in a most deplorable situation. - At
first they had nothing to lay upon but the damp
ground, many scarcely a rag to cover them.
Grass was got for them to lay upon, and a
blanket given amongst four of them. Have been
amongst them for hours, may say days together, going
from one tent to another, from one person to another,
and you may imagine that what I here beheld was not a
little affecting. The number landed sick were near 500,
most at the hospital, and some few dispersed here and
there throughout the camp. The misery I saw amongst
them is unexpressible ; many were not able to turn, or
even to stir themselves, and in this situation were
covered over almost with their own nastiness, their
heads, bodies, clothes, blanket, all full of filth and lice.
Scurvy was not the only nor the worst disease that pre-
vailed amongst them (one man I visited this morning, I
think I may say safely had 10,000 lice upon his body and
bed); some were exercised with violent fevers, and others
withanolessviolentpurgingandflux. The complaints they
had to make were no less affecting to the ear than their
outward condition was to the eye. The usage they met
with on board, according to their own story, was truly
shocking-; sometimes for days, nay, for a considerable
time together, they have been to the middle in water
chained together, hand and leg, even the sick not ex-
empted—nay, many died with the chains upon them.
Promises, entreaties, were all in vain, and it was not till
a very few days before they made the harbour that they
were released out of irons. The greatest complaints by
far were from those persons who had come in the
Neptune. No wonder that they should be so afflicted ;no
wonder to hear them groaning and crying and making
the most bitter lamentations. Endeavoured to commiserate
them under their afflictions, pitied them, encouraged
them to hope many of them would soon recover; that
every indulgence, every attention would be paid to them;
prayed with them, and gave some books amongst those of
them that were able to read.
You will, perhaps, be astonished when I tell you a little
of the villainy of these wretched people. Some would
complain they had no jackets, shirts, or trowsers, and
begged that I would intercede for them. Some by this
means have had two, three, four—nay, one man had not
less than six different slops given him, which he would
take an opportunity to sell to some others, and then make
the same complaints and entreaties. When any of them
were near dying, and had something given them as bread
or lillipie (flour and water boiled together), or any other
necessaries, the person next to him or others would catch
the bread, &c., out of his hand, and, with an oath, say
that he was going to die, and therefore it would be of no
service to him. No sooner would the breath be out of
any of their bodies than others would watch them and
strip them entirely naked. Instead of alleviating the
distresses of each other, the weakest were sure to go to
the wall. In the night-time, which at this time is very
cold, and especially this would he felt in the tents, where
they had nothing hut grass to lay on and a blanket
amongst four of them, he that was strongest of the four
would take the whole blanket to himself and leave the
rest quite naked. These three last ships have now been
here about six weeks. In this time you may suppose
there have been great alterations among the sick ; a good
many are so far recovered that they have got to work, a
■great number have died ; have buried not less than 86
since they landed—B4 convicts, one child, and one soldier,

At a Queensland town, not long ago, the
police-sergeant ran down a man who, it was sus-

asked leave to withdraw the charge and dismiss

said the chairman J.P., “ if you weesli ; but ye’ll

The cabmen of Sydney make fo. r

shall be in accordance only with the increase of
population ; (3) that lost property shall become
the perquisite of the cabman or vantnan if not
claimed within a specified time; (4)that the cabmen
have a working representative on the Transit
Commission. These requests strike The Bulletin
as all eminently reasonable —with the exception of
that relating to lost property.
When David Christie Murray was in Aus-

in which the local buliocky damned the hair,

“Rosey,” and “ Bluenose,” &c. Presumably
Murray never heard the following yarn of old
Wm. Wentworth, or he’d have told it. One day
Wentworth overtook a buliocky who was stuck up
by two jibbing leaders. As Wentworth came up
buliocky was offering to lay the leaders a fiver
he’d “shift ’em ” or their “bloomin’ ’ide, any-
ways.” At the first crack the handle of the whip
broke. Then the incensed driver rushed in front
of the team, and, rolling up his cabbage-tree hat,
he pointed it gun-fashion in the leaders’ faces and
swore first to shoot ’em, and secondly that when
he got a fresh handle he’d give ’em such h—l
that their eyeballs would shoot out of their heads,
run round their horns and fight like blanky oats
along their backbones. “My man,” said Went-
worth, “here’s a pound. I never heard an oath
like that before.”

Blowitz, Paris correspondent of the Times,
has evidently done something to Henry Lucy,
who writes in S.M. Herald :
Apart from his undoubted journalistic genius he is a
very remarkable man. In height he is, I should say, fully
sft., and in diameter some 3ft. Ioin., bufSo remarkable is
his fascination that, with a bevy of ladies, the handsomest
man has no chance with him. He has learned English
lately, and talks it with fluency, if not always with pre-
cision. There is a charming story told of his greeting to
the Times managing proprietor and his wife when he
visited Bearwood on his arrival,in England. “And are
you well off, Mr. Walter?” he asked, anxious for the state
of his host’s health. “ Ah, and there is Madame ; she is
well off too, 1 can see."
The Salvation Army crams its English
readers with this touching anecdote :
In the olden times—in the slave trade days—it is said
that the slaves were often branded, like cattle, with the
name of the owner. . And, alas ! those slave days are not
over, for this week, when visiting in one of the so-called
beautiful cities of New Zealand, our officers came across
a poor girl, only partly clad, in the street. They took
her home, looked after her, made her warm, and put her
comfortably to bed. In doing so, they saw she had a
name on her arm, which, upon enquiries, they found was
the name of the “gentleman” who “owned ” her. It
was, indeed, a pitiful ease. The poor girl would lie awake
at night crying for her mother, who had died and left her
to the mercies of the cold world.
The story stops there just when it was beginning
to grow interesting. Presumably that gentleman
bought the girl when she was young, and ran her
into his yard, and fastened her head in a bail,
and branded her, and then Uuimd her loose in a
paddock. How she escaped isn’t explained ; per-
haps the boundary-rider neglected to repair the
fence and she strayed away through the breakage,
and somehow missed being impounded. The
most interesting point of all would be the name
of the person who branded her, but that is left
out altogether.

If the woman was only occupying her late husband’s
property, the case is again different. Let us know
whether it was her own property “Miner's Right":
If a miner puts on improvements under a miner’s right,
the improvements are generally allowed for. Write direct
to the Lands Office and the case will be considered....
“ Gander Sauce ” : To do Mr. Stead justice, he does make
a similar protest in the case of the Lords.... “ A.M.” :No
son of O’Connell, the “Liberator,” now lives ...“The
Sphinx ” (Vic.): Thanks, but send us something Austra-
lian “H.J.Mac.” (The original and genuine article):
Will keep our best eye on him “Geo. B.” (A.):
Excellent suggestions “Subscriber” (Alexandra):
Thanks, but nothing new.... “ P.T.” (Brisbane): Prima-
facie spiteful. You are jealous of a policeman ...
“ Lachlan Cruiser ” ; Thanks for your suggestions. Name
and address, please “L.H.C.” ; What were the names
of them ?.?.. “W. P. Knight ” : Haven’t seen your sketch.
...“0.C.0.”: Coroners’ juries are quite useless so far
as we can see, and serve no purpose that cannot as well be
served by an intelligent coroner. The Crown is not
bound by their findings. Though they return a verdict
of accidental death the State can still prosecute for
murder or manslaughter, and though they acquit a person
of arson the State can still charge him at criminal sessions
with having fired his premises.... “A.L.”: The comparison
fails. Dibbs practically understands navigation
“ Arthur J.” (W.): Assuming that the sketches sent are
absolutely original, you display so much artistic feeling
that you should learn to draw. No sketch is too small for
reproduction, but the average drawing looks much better
when photographically reduced.. . “T.K.” (Cobargo) :
We decline to gratify your animosity against the police-
man who had you fined, by publishing a picture showing
him asleep with a bottle in his hand “ Winkle” (North
Sydney); In short, when you find a girl who is faultlessly
beautiful and hasn’t a single detect of character, you will
marry her “The Reed ” : Declined. The “ Grave in
the Bush” is declined a little harder than the rest, a
grave in the bush being no more surprising than one in
the cemetery... “Pax V”: We don’t know, but most
such places we do know intimately are swindles. Nearly
everything else is a swindle a 150.,, “Mac ” : Dull as a dead
preacher “Acunthla”: “The Solitary” who is
“ alone amid the loud, excited throng” is bosh, regarded
as an object for sympathy. We are as solitary as that
every time we go to Parramatta, but we don’t weep over
it.... “ Rouseabout” : Hardly good enough, and need-
lessly disfigured by the wattle-blossom on the grave
“ Bosso ” : Will make good par. when remorselessly boiled
down. . “ War of 1892 ” : Interesting, but the subject
died of old age long ago “F.C.”: Very incongruous
in places. Even the oldest and meekest of husbands
doesn’t allow his wife’s former lovers to call and kiss her
promiscuously when he’s about “Shadow”; That
sort of joke w’as old when the shock-headed cave-dweller
used to be scared out of his seven senses by the mam-
moth “ Gridironed ” ; Thanks ; will keep it in mind...
“J. Cleary”: Article on boarding-houses accepted. Poem
interesting, but the metre bumps like a coffin-ship grind-
ing on a reef in a heavy 5ea....“ The Chiel” : Thanks....
“ Old Bull ” : Your story of how you threw up entrench-
ments and stood off the circumjacent nigger is evi-
dently written under the idea that the blackfellow
gives three cheers and charges with the bayonet....
“A. Newry”: Tub Bulletin printed Mr. Adams’ poem
over Mr. Adams’ own signature. It never believed the
Orange lie that Irish Nationalism is synonymous with
Romanism “ Paddy Melon ” : The legend of how Dibbs
was led astray by Victoria’s hash is intensely stupid
“T.S.A.” (Wilcannia) : Cow’- story needs washing
“ Smilax”; May possibly publish, though the boy who
was nearly being spanked in Scotland is rather remote.. .
“A.H.”: “The anguished burdens I heavily bear”
sounds as if you had a pain in your portmanteau... “F.
Tasellie” : Don’t like the subject, but you have a remark-
able command of rhyme, and the versification if far above
the average.... “ Effa ” : Fantastic drivel, like Byzantine
architecture gone mad “O.O.O.”: The same old
platitudes. If you have one new idea in all your
soul, for Heaven’s sake write it out in full on
the back of a postage-stamp and send it along
“Jenny Wren”: It is a rule in this office never to pub-
lish stories of Italian counts wandering with ambrosial
locks beside the Mediterranean while Bianca glares among
the orange-groves. You see, we try not only to be
original, buc to appear original We respect
the J.P. who says he is “setting on the bench.” We
know lots of Js.P. who don’t even know how to do that
much “X.”: We simply mean what we say—no
financial institution dare openly ask more than 8 per
cent. When it has advanced money at 8 per cent, it
often makes it 20 by “faking” the accounts—which is 8
per cent, interest and 12 per cent, highway robbery
“ Spoker ” : Thanks “ J.D.” : Darby Flannigan’s
dream is pointless. AH Irishmen seem to dream of
whisky, except when they dream of priests and pigs....
“ J O." : It seems, after reading the case, that your semi-
paralytic J.P. is a lot more fair in his dealings than most
justices who are not paralytic. He may forget the evi-
dence thaf. has been given, but that’s better than remem-
bering evidence that hasn’t been given at all . “The
Dingo”: Duly received ...“Stockwhip”; One very
good story in the collection, anyhow... “Elia”: You
are all right while you keep the track of the
old “Song of the Shirt,” but when your seamstress
goes away to drown herself you become weak...
“E.C.” (South Yarra): The d.y b;.ie«of old, dead Yankee
jokes. They oaly want the nigger and the pumpkin to
be complete.... “M. L. Democrat ” (Gisborne): You may
be a democrat all right, but your poetry is a thing for the
gods to howl at “Roy Kerr”: If the Britisher sets
down all our ancestors as convicts, what matter? His
ancestors, the unhanged thieves and murderers of Ger-
many, Denmark, and Normandy, were worse, and many
of them never bad a square wash from the cradle to the
grave... “J.H.G.” (St. Kilda); “Ode to a Seagull” is
only cold-boiled Longfellow and Shelley hashed up.,..
“Pay-Day”: What a plot! An uninteresting con-
sumptive with clammy hands jilts a pale, pock-
marked girl and then they both die “Komai”;
The story of how Chawles lost his billet is of no interest
to anybody except Chawles himself “ Eiffa ” : Very
inferior Jules Verne mixed with a quantity of decayed
Edgar Allan Poe “ Freeakers ”; Will consider . .
“ The Curlew”: Put it in a sentence: “Horse disqualified
for being overweight. Backeis stone-broke. Owner’s
solitary one-pound note blew away while he was looking
ut it in a high wind.”.. . “J.G.D.’; Declined for three
reasons ; (1) It is old ; (2) objectionable moral at the end;
(3) halo round the dead man’s head... “Justin Tyme” :
In short, a fisherman’s wife was bugged by a lawyer, after
which nothing happened, and you write to explain that
“ the incidents actually took place.”

Wo encountered number of natives of both
sexes, of pleesing presence and good temper. They
exprest their admiration for our cloathing but
seemed at a loss to know whether we were all men

pointed to their women and made signs as tho’
to inquire where were ours. . . . At last, to

Labouchere : “ M. Abeille, the co-respon
dint shot by jealous Mr. Deacon, was a podgy
It tie fellow, dyed, bald, greasy, ugly as sin.”
Fancy you’ve heard that before.
A prisoner got clear away in a peculiar
way (Adelaide) the other day. Some years ago, the
local Parliament raised “the age of female con-
sent ’ to 1G years, and enacted, for the pro-
tection of young boys, that when the accused is
under 1G years of age consent shall be a good
defence. A man of 40, a member of a church
choir, was lately arrested for an offence against a
girl under IG. Evidence black against the prisoner
was taken for several hours, and the betting was
Broken Hill to a hymn-book that he would be
committed. Suddenly some mysterious impulse
caused the prosecuting lawyer to look at the Act,
and in scanning the clause about boys he misread
“accuser” for “accused.” Much chagrined, he
remarked that he had never before noticed this
extraordinary provision, in face of which it was
useless to proceed, as the “accuser,” the girl, was
clearly under IG. Pater, S.M., replied that it was
a monstrous shame for Parliament to pass a law
with so hideous a defect ; still, as it was the law,
he must dismiss the prisoner, which was accord-
ingly done, to the great astonishment of that
individual, whose lawyer had kept discreetly
quiet. Then all the staffs of the daily papers
tried to find the hideous defect so as to write
slashing leaders about the legalisation of vice;
they read that Act in various attitudes for many
hours without any defect becoming visible, and at
last sent to the prosecuting lawyer to say they didn’t
believe there was such a thing, and the lawyer
calmly replied that he agreed with them, and that
in court he had made the mistake of thinking the
Act said just the reverse of what it does say.

HOW SHE DOES IT
TO watch a woman despatching her letters by
mail is a highly interesting study. In the
matter of dropping a simple, white, ordinary,
every-day letter, for instance, she affords an
admirable insight into the character of the average
female. Filled with this thought, like as a Labour
Member in parliament with his own importance,
we yesterday placed ourselves on duty in a con-
venient spot for observation, near the receipt of
mails. A sedate-looking young lady shortly put
in an appearance. She took a letter from a
reticule, which had not been built to accommodate
much more than a society envelope and a postage
stamp, and then suddenly discovered that the
stamp was somewhere else. An exhaustive search
revealed its whereabouts, and having licked it in
two sections and affixed it to the well-wetted right
hand corner of the envelope, she proceeded to-
wards the slot. Her fingers, however, refused to
relax their grip upon the precious message, and
she withdrew it hesitatingly to scan both sides
and be very sure it was securely sealed and
properly addressed, and to be certain that no
inquisitive eye could gleam a hint of its contents
through the cover. Then she -“lets it drop,”
which is just what the doctors do when they find
that a _ case of rheumatism, sciatica, gout, or
neuralgia is beyond their power, and they find
themselves forced to admit that they “can do
nothing more.” But if they can’t, St. Jacobs Oil
can, a fact which Mr. Easby, of King-street, New-
town, near Sydney, emphasises as follows: “I
have been a erreat sufferer from rheumatism, and
have spent a large sum in doctors’ bills, in addition
to trying nearly every specific I could hear of, but
have never found anything but St. Jac.-*-s Oil to
give me relief.”

A Throat
and Lung
Specialty.
Those who have not
used Boschee’s Ger-
man Syrup for some
severe and chronic
trouble of the Throat
and Bungs can hard-
ly appreciate what a truly wonder-
ful medicine it is. The delicious
sensations of healing, easing, clear-
ing, strength-gathering and recover-
ing are unknown joys. For Ger-
man Syrup we do not ask easy cases.
Sugar and water may smooth a
throat or stop a tickling—for a while.
This is as far as the ordinary cough
medicine goes. Boschee’s German
Syrup is a discovery, a great Throat
and Bung Specialty. Where for
years there have been sensitiveness,
pain, coughing, spitting, hemorr-
hage, voice failure, weakness, slip-
ping down hill, where doctors and
medicine and advice have been swal-
lowed and followed to the gulf of
despair, where there is the sickening
conviction that all is over and the
end is inevitable, there we place
German Syrup. It cures. ) You are
a live man yet if you take it. ©

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Correze, a big pot for last year’s Melbourne
Cup, now belongs to the owner of last year’s winner.
Janies Redfearn, therefore, owns Malvolio and Correze.
Now-, for which of them is Jimmy’s third string, Marco,
going to make the pace?
* * *
Titan is the only representative of Donald
Wallace in this year’s Melh. Cup, and if his numerous
failures proved only a prelude to a romp home under
7st. 81h. for the £lO,OOO, what a wild, weird wail there’d
be ! Stranger things have happened !
• # *
The prevailing depression has reduced the pro-
fessional tipsters’ fees for the Derby and two Cups treble
from 30s. to a guinea—and poor biz. at the money.
* * #
A Southern sporting scribe calculates from past
years, that 6 to 1 will be offered, at the post, on the field,
for the G.N. Steeple this Saturday.
* # *
The A.JVC. stewards reduced the distance of
the Metropolitan because of the overshadowing influence
of the Melbourne Cup, for which the first-rate two-mile
horses are always reserved. But only' ten additional
nominations have been received for the shorter distance,
and amongst that number are both Derby and Caulfield
Cup candidates whose chances are not likely to be pre-
judiced by starting at Randwick ; so that little is likely
to be gained by the innovation. Victorian owners, many
of whom have an absurd idea that handicapper Scarr has
a grudge against them, are once more conspicuously
absent.
* * *
The Bulletin mentioned four horses as likely
to win the G.N. Hurdle Race at Flemington, viz., Redleap
or Norbert, Havilah, and Abergyle. Norbert was wit h-
drawn in favour of his big stable companion, and of the
other three, Redleap won, whilst Havilah and Abergyle,
after showing a good deal in the front, finished fourth and
fell over respectively'. Moreover, Havilah had already
won the first race in a canter. Redleap, (whose chance
for the Hurdle Race was not seriously discussed by any'of
the accredited sporting papers) is now in great form. He
can do what he likes with the rest of the Millers’ horses
in private, and will certainly win the Steeplechase on
Saturday, barring accidents and several other considera-
tions, the most important of which is Beau Brummel.
The riding of the Beau last Saturday leaves the jumping
ability of that fast horse still open to doubt, but it wi 1
take a good one to beat Redleap, anyway, for Redleap is
the Carbine of the “sticks.”

They propose to give Slavin a testimonial. It is
bad enough to support the successful sloggers without
having to keep the defeated ones. There’s room in the
police.
# # #
It is many months since the first International
tug-of-war contest w'as held in Sydney'. Then the lubberly
representatives from the British naval squadron were
hauled in like fish by almost every nation that opposed
them. The Britishers have taken those drubbings quite
sadly to heart, and have been practising pulling and haul-
ing on Garden Island ever since. Some squads toil pain-
fully in the slush, while others strain, grunt, heave, and
splutter on the verandah of one of the buildings.
# * *
Melbourne hunting men complain that although
the V. A.T.C. retains “Amateur” as part of its title, the
Australian Hunters’ Cup has been struck out of the pro-
gramme of the Caulfield Cup meeting, notwithstanding
that the rejected race has brought out such rare ’chasers
as Busaco, Tyro, and Osric.
# # *
M lorlland jockey Gifford, who died recently,
is credited with an unblemished name—a most rare thing
in horsemen. Nothing shady was ever imputed to him,
and he was equally clever on the flat and over the fences.

Melbourne SPORTSMAN has apparently dropped
Slavin in favour of Goddard, whom it labels “An un-
beaten Australian, in the lists for the World’s Champion-
ship.”

Markham, the high jumping N.Q. aboriginal,

The Maoriluuder.s had some doughty opponents
;n England. Shaw, who beat Batger, is an Englishman
formerly domiciled in Maoriland. Owing 20 yards in a
j-ecent 120-yard hurdle race, he won in IS 2-ssec.

TheY.R.C. expects a heavy deficit on the Grand
National meeting, but the Steeple (this Saturday) is likely
to he the best ever run at Flemington.
# * #
King’s School, Parramatta, N.S.W., apparently
owns an all round phenomenon in its school-captain,
Waddyq who has achieved the dux position although he
has only been two y ears in the institution. Waddy won
the Jersey prize for English, the Bishop Smith prize for
divinity. Speaker Abbott’s prize for history and geography,
the Cox prize for mathematics, and the head master’s
prize for Latin prose ; in addition to which, he carried off
all the cricket trophies—highest individual score, highest
aggregate score, and best averages in hatting and bowling.
This prodigy is the son of bank-manager Waddy, of
Morpeth. N S.W.

“Augur” Chapman's estate lias been proved
at £3935. The fiver needed to make it an even four thou,
probably represents the joint estate of those who con-
sistently, backed that most estimable gentleman’s vaticina-
tiviis.

Melbourne Standard now decorates its office

on Saturday nights. Presently Britannia will have to

Says The Bulletin's London correspondent:—
The descriptions of the Jackson-Slavin light which
appeared in the London sporting papers give hut a faint
idea of the one-sided nature of the contest. They appear
to me to have been written with a view to soothing Slavin
in his defeat. From the first to the last the darkey held
the winning hand; at no stage did it seem to me that
Slavin had the ghost of a show. Paddy was utterly out-
generaled ; all his tremendous pile-drivers fell short,
except once in the fifth round. His hackers relied upon
Lis sickening Peter witli ins savage visitations in two or
three rounds. But instnndiiigup to Jackson hewasinfront
of a man of much higher class than any he has ever met
before. Had Jackson been half as savage as his opponent
he would have settled him in half the lime he did, and
almost assuredly lie could have done for him in the second
Some people think he is not a “ finisher,” but
I don’t agree with them, for he was on Monday
last the harder hitter of the two. But there is, I
think, a soft spot in him, an I I have frequently'noticed
that lie is never brutal, and often forbears to give the
enup de grace to a “ groggy ” opponent. It was so when
he fought Jim Smith, whom he could h ive settled long
ere the latter fouled him had ho gone on to finish him
when lie was half stup (led on the ropes. All through the
light Peter’s pleasant smile and the glistening of his pearl-
" n.te teeth gave one the idea of a good-natured giant
vvho wished to spare his antagonist unnecessary pain,
, 'in. on the contrary, with his moustache shaven,
looked a thorough ruffianly bruiser, and his face was a
. picture of savagery, intensified when he found lie was
o\ ermastered and could not get home with his accustomed
viciousne.-s. But ho stood up unflinchingly to take his
gruel, and if anyone questioned his pluck all doubts on
that ground were completely dispelled. A gamer man
never stood in a ring, and the way he came up to the
scratch time after time was beyond all praise. In this res-
pect he reminded me of the now much-abused Jim Smith,
''no in his best d ly was as brave a man as ever lived,
as witness his tight with Kilrain. Slavin is a real
1 tucked un, but Peter is too scientific for him. Slavin
ook his defeat very much to heart, for ho was cocksure
f Ptt r'.out, and when the latter went up to him
'’ f l ' l ~u h-ht in the nicest possible way without an atom
cockiness and said “ Frank, we must he friends only
one can win,” Slavin received him, I thought, rather
nastily and spoke about meeting again. There was never
a better-conducted battle, and it will do much to restore
the fading prestige of glove-fighting. I have little doubt
but that in a smaller ring Slavin would have given a
better account of himself, but 20 feet is quite small enough
for men of such size. I may add that Slavin appeared to
he rather fine drawn, but he looked the picture of con-
dition, as did Jackson, whose ebony skin shone like satin.
Pete was at the Derby next day none the worse for wear,
but I did not see the defeated one.

The skeleton of that grand old horse, Traducer,
is preserved in Christchurch (M.L.) Museum, but the man
who fixed up the remains of the beloved favourite put the
fore hoofs on the hind feet, and the hind hoofs on the
front ones, and poor Traducer is a melancholy mon-
strosity.
* * *
Rosenfeld, a London diamond merchant, popu-
larly known as the “lucky backer,” committed suicide,
the other day, on account of his losses. He didn’t strike
any run of bad fortune—he remained the “ lucky backer ”
to the end of his days, and in that capacity he swamped
some £300,000, or so, in three years. What he would
have swamped if he had been an unlucky backer is beyond
human, calculation. There is the workhouse ahead in
either case, but the fortunate punter is the one who gets
there last.

The luck of the Chinaman on the turf and off is
proverbial. At a Tukapuna, M.L., race-meeting the
present writer, after suffering a lot of bad luck,
determined just for once to fox a Chinese storekeeper
and follow his luck on the totalisator. It was a sailing-
race, and the Chow took a couple of tickets on an ill-
conditioned brute named The Worm, which had never
during a lengthy racing career as much as wriggled into a
place. Only three horses started, and the race ended,
Maelstrom 1, Ilangitiri 2, The Worm 3. But, behold!
Maelstrom was disqualified for jostling Ilangitiri,
Ilangitiri couldn’t draw weight, and 20 minutes after the
race was over a weary pressman was struggling with his
Chinese mascotte as to who should be first at the pay-
windbvv to draw a dividend of £3O 7s. per sovereign
invested !
# # #
The Sydney ex-amateur, young Pheasant —an
assumed name—made a good beginning by defeating Jim
Ryan in about four and a half minutes. Ryan was not
knocked to a standstill by any means,-but when Pheasant
commenced to spoil his beauty he did not take his gruel
kindly, and “went out” on short notice. Ryan is too
good-looking for a pugilist, When smart, good-looking
men feel their eyes closing, and their noses trying to smell
their left ears, they begin to think of what their best girl
will say about the matter, and they go down. Jem Hall,
for instance, is a phenomenal boxer, but—here apply
above theory.

Sydney University footballers defeated Rand-
wick on Saturday by 14 points to 7, notwithstanding that
Randwick had in its team an extraordinary amount of
athletic talent. “ Billy ” Macpherson, the phenomenal
amateur runner; Harris, the winner of two Carringtons
and a Botany Handicap ; Surman, a Botany Handicap
winner ; and Sullivan, who recently rowed Stanbury for
the championship.

Redleap, tlie Grand National winner, is out of
Pandora (not Malua’s sister, Pandora), whose sire was
Panic, and whose pedigree goes back to Rous’ Emigrant.
Dante, Redleap’s sire, is by Fireworks, out of Rose de
Florence.

Amateur riders came in first and second for the
Grand National Hurdle, V'.R.C., last week. What is the
line between amateur and pro.? In democratic countries
we ought to insist on abolishing it, in so far as it is any
such odious and false distinction as that between the
amateur and pro. players in the Ail E ngland cricket teams
—but that has diminished every trip.

The bloodthirsty supporters of the beaten side
in a Brisbane football match the other day, chased the
umpire, with the idea of tearing him to pieces. He had
to take refuge under a servant’s bed in an hotel.

An attempt is to be made to put life into pro-
fessional sculling by the offer of substantial prizes (£250
in all) for a handicap to come off on the Parramatta in
September.

No pony has a show of winning on a certain
track unless the officials are in the swim. An owner,
recently, had the audacity to take up all the market
money about his pony without letting these gentry into
the know, and then the fun began ; for let the field away
they would not whilst the backed pony was in position,
and, when they were let go, his tad was where his head
ought to have been, and he lost about 40 yards. He won,
however, and the crowd fairly yelled themselves hoarse in
cheering the pony and hooting the officials.
# * *
An idea prevails in the sporting community that
when a tote-proprietor publishes the number of backers
before the race is run it is impossible for him to pay the
winners less than their legitimate dividend. But that’s
an error. It is possible, under a show of the fairest seem-
ing, to juggle away half the money in a tote without
arousing suspicion, and there is scarce a tote-proprietor
in Sydney who hasn’t got locked away in his private
drawer a table of calculations on which this swindle is
based.

Flinders-street, in front of the Standard office,
Melbourne, every Saturday night has a crowd yelling over
the football results, as big as that awaiting the general
election. And still the German clerks swarm in.

It is complained in Maoriland that the totali-
sator conduces to too much racing, The Metropolitan
Club have the power of granting or refusing the smaller
club the right to use the machine ; and, it is said, tiiat
they are far too ready to grant these permits. Hon. E.
Mitchelson has just resigned his A.R.C. stewardship. “He
has abandoned all hope of the Club taking any action
either to purify raving or to suppress the continuous
abuse of the totalisator’’—which, it is cabled, the M.L.
Parliament has just refused to legally abolish.

English story of a parson and a bookmaker—
Which latter must be our own Joe Thompson. Parson
called round at an unreasonably early morning hour, and,
sticking up the book.’s secretary in the hall, explained
that he had come in hopes of getting a trifle for the poor
heathen, or for repairs to the church, or something.
Secretary went upstairs and laid the matter before his
employer, who was still in bed. The latter got up, con-
sidered the matter for a second, and then put his head
out of the door and said briefly, “ Give the (gory) hypo-
crite a pony.” A bookmaker going contentedly back to
bed, and a parson fainting in the hall finish the story.

Qur correspondent : The Eleven of England
captained by A. J. Wehhe, which played Cambridge
University the other day, includes three Australians, viz.,
Murdoch, Ferris, and the Biblical Woods. Stock Exchange
business must be slack at Bristol, for Ferris appears to
find it more profitable to play cricket. What a trans-
parent sham this “ amateur ” business is ! The quondam
Joint-Stocker, by the by, bowled uncommonly well in the
first innings of the Cantabs, as he took five wickets in
twelve overs for 25 runs.

It mustn’t be supposed that because Goddard
has whipped M'Aulifle, after what was no doubt a very
gory 15-round fight, that he can also beat Jackson. How-
ever, the fact that he did once mix things with Mr. Jack-
son very effectually in a drawn fight will make him anxious
to have another go at the darkey.

Herr Rassmussen, the Danish herbalist,
has made his appearance in Melbourne, where lie
has established, at 150 Bourke-street, the first
“Pill Palace” ever known in Australia. This
establishment is constructed on a particularly
elaborate scale, and as the demand for medicine
has no end, the Victorians will doubtless patronise
it. Herr Rassmussen’s Alfaline Remedies are
already well known throughout Victoria and New
South Wales, and as the demand seems to be
constant he will probably do well in his new
venture.
THE FLY-FLAT FOOL.
(A TALE TOLD IN A RACE-TRAIN.)
’Twas a neat sweet game of headin’ ’em, a flutter at
two-up
The boys was all enjoyin’ ’twixt the Steeple an’ the Cup ;
By “ the boys ” I means our talent ; each an artist cute
an’ cool,
’Cept a single lonesome stranger—a delightful fly-flat fool.
We had met the previous evenin’, the fool fly-flat an’ me,
An’ 1 tumbled to him kiddin’ he’s a bushie on the spree.
“ Half magsman and half mug.” says I, “ the very game
for us,
The very thing the talent lo\es—a fly-flat foolish cuss.”
I lets on that I was on him, so he cottons on to me,
An’ I tells him how to-morrer I’d a moral in a gee
As was lashin’ for the Steeple, an’ ’ud win as sure as
fate ;
lie cud meet me out at llandwick, get the office—
speculate.
Did he come? He come like water ! an’ he lost on every
race
Till I gave my promised office for the bloomin’ Steeple-
chase—
I no more had a griffin than I had a wooden leg,
But the fly-flat copped the office an’ he planked on every
peg-
Well, you know, this timber-toppin’ i 5 a very funny thing,
An’ them jumps around old llandwick oft the best to grief
will bring.
My dead moral, for a wonder, was the on’y one as stood,
An’ my joker copped a bundle an’ avowed my tip was
good.
Now the talent was the brokest they had been for many a
day,
We didn’t back my “moral,” I need scarcely, fel'ers, ray.
But we fixed it mighty sudden that his nibsey’s stuff was
ours,
Or should be, ere the day was sped but few more sultry
hours.
So I lakes him, after wettin’, for a stroll behind the trees,
Where, by accident, we finds the boys a headin’, if you
please.
“ Here’s a chance, mate,” says my covey ; “let us have a
cut in here,
We can do ’em for their gaunts or else its somethin’
mighty queer.”
Strike me pink if I’d to lead him ! He walked right into
the trap,
He was such a bloomin’ mug was this self-fancied cunnin’
chap.
When he’d lost about a fiver he whispers me : “ I say,
Ain’t yer such a thing about yer as a giddy little grey.”
I was shocked, acourse, an’ told him, an’ said me an’ all
the rest
Was straight; but flatty swore he always liked a bit the
best;
They was mugs, an’ he could see it, while he—why he
was fly
An’ hated mugs should beat him, if he didn’t might he die.
He continued for to grumble as they gathered in his tin
That he’d not fetched his greys an’dubs; his oath, he’d
ring ’em in.
When the talent had collected every dencr that he had
He walked to town along wi’ me, a-feelin’ very bad.
He told me confidential how he hated playin’ fair,
Preferrin’ to be spinnin’ of the eronk ’uns in the air,
An’ I kidded to he virchus an’ consider it a crime.
What? ’Course, you fool! the talent rung the cronk ’uns
all the time!

Some Sydney Press Reminiscences.
Dear Bulletin,—You tell a curious story
in a recent issue of a man who “wanted his
name kept out of the paper,” and didn’t suc-
ceed. I could tell you some still more curious. In
the days of old Sydney people got their names
kept out of the papers at a very low tariff. Re-
porters’ salaries were very small in those times, but
every man got free drinks and sides of bacon and
pots of jam from all sorts of people who wanted
to be mentioned, or wanted to avoid being men-
tioned, as the case might be. The pressmen got
drunk upon the drinks and generally lost the
bacon and the jam on their- way home, but that
was all in the day’s work. I remember one morn-
ing at the police-court, when five red-nosed literary
wrecks were taking notes, a person in a torn dress-
coat with a lump of mud on the tail, a crushed
hat, and a broken eye-glass, was charged with
riot, assault, oyster-supper, and too much ballet-
girl the previous night. He stated huskily, like a
man with a dry prawn in his throat, that he was
guilty, and the bench told him that it was a pain-
ful spectacle to see a man of his intelligence and
standing rushing headlong, &c., &c. Then it fined
him 55., and the gentlemanly ruin felt in his
pockets and found the coin with difficulty. Next
he looked regretfully at the reporters’ box, and
felt in his pockets again. There was only another
half-crown to be found. He grasped the coin in
his hot hand and came up stealthily like the first
murderer in “Macbeth,” and passed it to the
nearest reporter. “Could you haw small
tribute of esteem, dontcherknow—could you keep
my name out of the papahs?” The pressman
looked sadly at the coin, and then at the four other
noses which hung over the desk. “ It’s all I’ve got
about me,” said the ruin, apologetically. “Oh,
it’s quite enough for me,” said the pressman
hoarsely ; “ but just look at the crowd I’ve got to
divide it amongst!”
# * #
There were 14 Justices on the Bench that
day. The long benches in the Sydney police-
courts are a relic of the times when every J.P.
in the city scrambled for a seat in order that he
might wreak vengeance on his enemies, or do a
good turn to his personal friend, or to the man
who had bribed him. When an interesting
prisoner had to be admonished they used to rush
for the job—they couldn’t in common decency all
admonish the pale little girl who was hauled up
for larceny, for 14 admonitions would have been
about equal to murder. The man who got the
contract used to talk at her in a voice slightly
broken by emotion for 10 minutes or more, and
after that she was either sent to gaol or else fined
and thrown out. Then the J.P. either shouted
for the reporters or else lent them half-a-erown,
and they all mentioned the “eloquent and feeling
manner ” in which Mr. dealt with the
prisoner. This little advertisement helped to
boom his ham-shop in Redfern, or whatever and
wherever it was, and was prized accordingly. A
new J.P. started out on one occasion to deliver a
fatherly address to a woman and fine her half-a-
crown, but he broke down badly in his obser-
vations and was so mad at his failure that he
gave her three months. It was a common thing
for a reporter in those times, when he was woefully
dry, to send up, per a friendly policeman, a little
note asking the bench for the loan of sixpence.
Then the bench would hurriedly feel in its pants
pocket and produce a shilling, which it would
stealthily wrap up in paper and send down, with
the bench’s compliments. A vision of two
reporters sloping out swiftly and silently in search
of a drink would close the scene, and next day’s
paper always alluded feelingly to the acumen dis-
played by that particular “ beak ” in unravelling
some knotty law point concerning a vagrant found
slumbering in an ash-barrel.
* # #
Reporters died young in those days. On an
evening paper the staff generally drank itself
blind and imbecile every night in detachments,
beginning when the first edition came out, and
going on systematically till the last edition found
nobody in an even partially-responsible state
except the sub - editor. The miserably - paid
reporter was then a walking mass of drink—a
receptacle for tips, cigars, plugs of tobacco, and
every other kind of portable property. One press-
man vvhom I remember took out the value of some
complimentary observations in an immense piece
of bacon, and was jogging peacefully down
Sussex-street with the plunder when a police-
man, seeing a seedy-looking man travelling
with this provender on his shoulder, ran after
him. Then the pressman took a firmer grasp of
the pig-meat, and without even looking round,
bolted for his life. They ran nearly a mile before
the officer captured him, and then they recognised
each other. “ Great heavens, man,” said the
litterateur, feebly, “why didn’t you say it was
you? I thought it was the boas of the paper, and
he wanted half the bacon.” The same reporter
once demonstrated effectually that even a news-
paper man could be made too drunk. He was
sent to report a great semi-political feed, at which
nearly 150 potentates were present; and they all
wanted their names inserted in the paper. There
fore,.they told off an attendant specially to see
that the journalist had everything he wanted with
a view to keeping him in good humour, and that
pressman got royally drunk. When the speeches
began he was missing, but, on investigation, he
was found clutching a dead marine under the
table. Somebody brought him out and shook him
up, and then he sat with his notes in his hand,
and looked with a glazed eye at the chairman till
the proceedings were over. After that he got lost
somewhere in the streets, but about 1 a.m. a
sound of tangled footsteps was heard upon
the stairs of a Sydney newspaper office, and
the pressman lurched heavily into the editor's
room, laid down a scrap of crumpled “copy,” and
then fell across the table. The report of that
gorgeous show ran thus: “The table groansh
’neath th* load goo’ tbingsh provided.” lie had
forgotten everything except the victuals and the
drinkables. But no pressman can forget that
statement about the table “groaning;” it is
imbedded in his constitution. —Yours,
TITUS SALT.

paper) of another Sydney journal’s copyright row
with an English publisher.

Sydney Echo upon the statue of Bass, the
explorer, recently erected in front of Sydney
Lands Office ; —
He stands 7ft. lush, wears knee-breeches and loose
shirt, and carries in his left hand the end of a coil of rope
which dangles from the right—or, rather, would dangle if
it were nob made of stone. His head is uncovered, and
the attitude is intended to give an idea of the man as he
appeared in the course of his explorations.
Bass, 7ft. high, going round with a rope in his
hand ready to hang any aboriginal he might meet,
is evidently the Echo's idea of art. And his
attitude, which is a very stiff and unnatural one,
is that which he used “in the course of his ex-
plorations,” from which it seems that the Echo
thinks there is a fixed attitude for explorers, and
that they invade a new country with a sort of
goose-step. After this, whenever we see a man in
that attitude —which we don’t expect to do till the
Judgment—we will know that he is exploring.

'1“\0 you suffer from Headache, and Dizziness
| / in the head. Have you pains under the
jibs or shoulders? Are you affected with heart-
burn or indigestion ? If so, have you ever asked
yourself why this is? You certainly are allowing
two of the chief organs in your structure to
become neglected. The liver and kidneys are
responsible for these ill-feelings, and you are
getting too much work out of them without
attending to their wants in the particular func-
tions they have to sustain.
These organs are in continual play day and
night) waking or sleeping, and any constitution
will not stand, bo it ever so good, if its internal
requirements are not attended to.
The liver and kidneys cannot put up with re-
pudiation, and they soon let you know it, and it is
highly necessary that Paramo should be ad-
ministered to their wants. This vegetable pre-
paration is particularly adapted to these com-
plaints, and those persons who have already taken
it assure us they never felt better in their lives.
Mother Mary Joseph Aubert has been par-
ticularly successful with Paramo, and is daily
receiving numberless enquiries in reference to it.
The agents are continually receiving letters and
telegrams from all parts of New Zealand, and
have confidence in saying that no other remedies
are giving the same amount of general satisfaction.
Give Paramo a fair trial, and note how quickly
your mental depression leaves you. It is worth
the experiment, and will certainly do no harm.
Wellington, 20th August, 1891.
Manager Aubert Remedies.
Dear Sir, —Please send, per bearer, one gross
Mother Joseph’s Remedies, as ordered last night.
The demand for them is daily increasing, and I
have never seen any medicine sell like them before,
in the whole course of my experience; the public
are universally satisfied.
Yours truly,
WM. E. WOODS.
In mediaeval times the great ambition of the
wise men, such as alchemists, magicians and
astrologers, was to find the Philosopher’s Stone,
to discover a method whereby the transmutation
of metals might be effected, and, chief of all, to
manufacture an essence, or potion, by which the
human life could be indefinitely prolonged. This
essence was called the Elixir Vitae, or Elixir of
Life. Many were the attempts, and much
scientific skill and knowledge was wasted, in the
vain endeavour to wrest from nature her secrets.
If all this learning and all this skill had been
turned to something practicable, mankind might
have been considerably benefited, but, as it was,
nothing of any tangible benefit accrued from the
researches of these ancient scientists. Now,
Mother Mary Joseph Aubert has not attempted
an impossibility, she has not unduly sought to
pry into the secrets of nature, but she has, by long
and careful study, discovered that certain New
Zealand herbs and plants have health-giving and
curative properties of an extremely high order.
By years of experience she has proved their
efficacy, and these medicines are now brought
forth to the public in the full conviction that no
worthless quackery is being introduced, but that
what is stated as to their medicinal properties is
an absolute fact. These preparations have won
“golden opinions from all sorts of men,” and the
testimony of such prdminent personages as Lord
Onslow, Archbishop Redwood, Mr. Bentley, the
actor, and hosts of others, should be convincing.
Paramo is a splendid medicine for complaints
of the Liver and Kidneys.
Marupa cures Asthma, Coughs and all Bronchi*!
Affections.
Natanata prevents and cures Diarrhoea, Vomit'

Karana is a most excellent Tonic, giving

great benefit to yourself.

A True Story of the Dead Deeming.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Deeming was hanged and they’d just cut him down,
And lie lay like an infant with never a frown,
Reposeful ins features, the Law was ins master,
So now was the t me come to cast him in plaster.
An artist, who’s used up some paint in his time,
Went straight for the hands of this Champion in Crime,
They’d be useful, lie thought, for a portrait, some day,
Of a well-to-do hanker or smug M.L.A.
The hrnshman approached the inanimate form
And grasped a dead hand that was still “pretty warm,”
Then, preparing ids plaster—the corpse was on show !
His artist’s soul whisper’d, “ A yrand curio 1”
The arms of the deader lay straight by his side,
Those arms that had cuddled, killed, buried two brides—
The hands were outspread, the rough lingers apart,
When the artist began “ in the interests of Art.”
Now, in order to get the claw quite at its best
That artist-man raised it to lay on the breast—
But Deeming objected ! He thought that a man’s a
Full right to Ills hands and—just see the next stanza.
The artist had no sooner Frederick’s arm bent
Than Deeming, though dead, one last great effort spent
In giving the man with the plaster a grip
That turned his blood cold and brought d nto ids lip.
With a leap and a hound in the air lie got free
And then gazed in blank terror, expecting to see
The corpse sitting up while a devilish grin
Played merrily over that eloquent chin.
’Tsvas a tendon contracted—of course you have guess’d—
And Frederick lay frigid in well-earnfed rest;
But that artist declares (now the corpse is e’en numb-er)
“No live Mason grips like that hanged and damned
plumber.”
THE PHCENIX.
A hard case was that of LadyGoldsmid, who
died a few weeks ago, in London. She and her
husband were immensely wealthy, and would
receive £300,000 more, under a will contingency,
if they only produced a son, but, most cruelly,
their family was eight daughters. Reminds you
of Carlyle’s Marquis Mirabeau, with his recipe for
sons—result 17 daughters.
It is not generally known that Allpress,
the Commercial Bank robber, made two trips to
England between the time of robbery and the
date of apprehension. He found the notes were
not negotiable in England so returned to Victoria
and went to Ballarat and other places where he
obtained circular notes payable in South Africa
and elsewhere. Getting away at night for the
second time he was finally arrested in London.

She was a stage siren, feeding by herself
at a certain Melbourne restaurant, and a quiet-
looking young man came up and begged to remind
her that he had had the pleasure of meeting her
before, doncherknow. But the fair consumer was
not anxious to renew the acquaintance. She kept
her eye fixed on the wing of her chicken, and
remarked that one meets so many people that one
forgets whom one has met —and so the stranger
retired in a crushed condition. Then the waiter,
being a wag, hovered round the artiste until she
asked him casually if he knew anything about
the gentleman who spoke to her just now, where-
upon the waiter gazed upon his questioner in a
respectfully reproachful manner, and replied that
the party referred to was a certain squatter of
prodigious wealth —a wild dog who, as all the
world knows, is addicted to spending tons of
money when he comes to town. The effect of this
fiction upon the lady was painful to witness. She
bit her nether lip until nearly all the paint came
off, her large, lustrous eyes opened and shut
violently, as though worked by a string, and she
poured forth, in a rich undertone, a large quantity
of strange words, which the waiter charitably
believes to have been Greek quotations.

This is what happened to James Brown, a
respectable horse-dealer in Maoriland. He had
gone down to Invercargill on business, and was
staying at a hotel, when one evening he was
informed that a lady wanted to see him. There-
upon, Brown went down to interview the lady,
and the next tiling he knew an excited female,
with a dead fowl and a bunch of flowers in her
bonnet, threw herself violently on his chest, and
said she would never, never leave him any more.
He tore himself loose from her and asked her
if she was a maniac, and she replied that
she wasn't —she was Brown’s lost wife come
back. The horse-dealer called out wildly that he
hadn’t any lost wife so far as he was aware,
but the lady only grasped him some more, and
declared that she would never part with him
again, and if the landlord hadn't dragged her off
by the back of the frock the statement would pro-
bably have come true. Then she went, forth
weeping and summoned the horse-dealer for main-
tenance. She stated in court that she and Brown
had boon children together among the green hills
of County Clare, and when she was 1(5 they were
married. Then her husband left her for Maori-
land, and she took a billet as attendant in a
lunatic asylum, but after a while she followed him
and looked for him all over Australasia. She might
never have found him if it hadn't been that she one
daysaw an advertisement in the paper about a horse
for sale, 1(5 hands high and warranted sound, and
at the foot of the notice was the familiar name of
Brown. She was prepared to swear that he was
the man she wanted. Then Brown repudiated the
charge, and asked if a man couldn't sell a horse
without being rushed by wild fema'es and em-
braced in hotels and sued for maintenance. He
wanted to know what evidence there was against
him, and the lady said that an Irishman some-
where on the West Coast knew all about it, only
he wasn’t present, and a woman named Kelly was
acquainted with the circumstances, but she was
living in a tow n 300 miles away. Case dismissed.

Queen Victoria, shocked at the terrible
distress now prevailing in England, consented to
relax the official melancholy over Clarence’s death
and allow the Royal Family to appear in public
with a view to stimulating business and relieving
the depression. There has been nothing so
childish as this since the time of the No Popery
riots when somebody borrowed a fat alderman to
overawe the howling mob, and the alderman hid
under the bed when he heard the mob coming.
A very affecting scene was witnessed at a
Sydney tram-stopping place the other day. A
rather pretty girl and her Reginald were there
waiting—the former intended to depart by the
incoming tram, and the gentleman was there to
bid his beloved a long, a last farewell. They were
botli utterly broken up at the prospect of parting,
and the glorious hazel eyes of both were dimmed
with unshed tears. They repeated their fond
good-byes, with osculatory accompaniments, in
various tones indicative of complete heart-break
long ere their tram came in sight, while thei,’.
embraces were noted derisively by the callous folk s
around. At last the expected motor hove in view,
and with another instalment of sob, they convul-
sively embraced with such vigour that it appeared
an absolute certainty something mu-t “ bust.
Then there was another long, long kiss, sounding
like a paint brush reluctantly coming out of a
glue-pot, and they lingeringly separated, with
flushed features and dishevelled attire, amid sup-
pressed applause from the spectators, and the
tram came up—-and went by without stopping,
for it was a through-tram. Then the enthusiast!.)
of the crowd came out audibly, and the owners of
two mouths that had kissed as one prayed for a
cyclone to come along and to wipe them off the
face of Elizabeth-street.
Alas ! for Are divine that burns
Within a poet’s breast ;
Base coal that brings in cash returns,
In this world pays the best.
But when these two reach Heaven’s gate
The bard’s turn will begin,
For Peter will not hesitate
To let a poet in.
But to the man of coal he’ll turn
And sternly bid him go
To where the fires eternal burn,
There stoke for Nick below.

From the Commonweal (London) article
for which the editor was gaoled ;
Would not a single one among us feel his heart beat
with an immense joy in hearing the shrivelling of the
grease of the rich, and the howling of that mass of flesh
swarming in the midst of that immense vessel all in a
blaze? In fact, what delight, in our town, to see, even
at a distance, such a red conflagration. A thousand times
more beautiful to our eyes than the dazzling of the purest
diamond. To bear bowlings, the cries of pain, and the
rage of wolves, their females and their joung ones in the

THE SHAREHOLDER’S SONG,
oh, once I was as happy as a shareholder could he.
Eight bob 1 paid for Broken Hills and had the luck to see
Those shares go up to fourteen pounds, I thought they’d
never stop ;
But now they’re down to three pound ten and still seem
like to drop.
Of course there’s only one thing that can properly be
done,
When Broken Hills to three-pound-ten come tumbling
with a run
The wages of the miners must he lowered. Damn their
eyes !
If I’m not worth what I was once, their worth should fall
likewise.
With what the daily papers say I perfectly agree :
If shares go up in price that gain is wholly due to me.
But if they fall—and here again I take that paper’s view—
It's only right that miners should take lower wages, too.
I wish we lived in Germany, where miners, I’ve heard say,
Are worked for thirteen hours or so forhalf-a-crown a day,
If we could bring those rates about—wo would, if I’d my
will.
What piping times there’d be for those who’d shares in
Broken Hill !
The Wild-Cat Column.
Sydney D.T. howls at the Barrier miners be-
cause they left the big mine at a time when a collapse
might occur at any moment. That’s right—blame the
miners for everything! Are they not also guilty of the
constant assurances of safety which have appeared in
every Australian daily newspaper and in none more pro-
minently or recently than the D.T. itself?

A Broken Hill miner declares that the world
does not contain a mining manager worth £4OOO a year.
Be that as it may, the Broken Hill directors are not
justified in giving an amount four times as great as would
he accepted by a hundred of Howell’s equals. In big insur-
ance and banking institutions dependent upon the public
for their financial success tremendous salaries are given
to managers, not because of the value of their services,
but for the advertisement which the salary secures. No
such object exists in connection with a silver-mine.
# # #
It is not merely the contract-system which the
Broken Hill owners desire but the competitive contraet-
system—the death-grapple in the gutter of labour with
labour. As Sydney D.T.’s “gentleman in Sydney,” who
recently obtained the confidences of the “ principal
directors of the Broken Hill mines,” cold-bloodedly says:
“The directors have for a long lime been making a
marked advance on the Labour chess-board and know
now that the men will he reduced to starvation.”

A Victorian ex-bank-manager says he valued
certain land within 30 miles of Melbourne at £6 10s. per

consequences are now attributed to “ general depression ”
and the “ excessive demands cf labour.”

Fifty to one the real cause of the Broken Hill

We have been studying the list of shareholders
in the deceased Australian Banking Co. of Sydney, and go
back right here upon our previous conviction that suffi-
cient might yet be obtained in calls to pay the depositors
iu full. The depositors and pretty nearly all the other
creditors are a gone case—gone and dead and utterly
deceased. There are about 400 shareholders on the list,
and about 90 per cent, are located in the country dis-
tricts. They are mostly women - elderly, toil-worn
governesses, servants, lady-helps, widows with a f£w hun-
dreds between them and starvation, and huslnvomen who
invested the savings of a lifetime spent in wrestling with
the sad, lank, leprous cow in a barren land ; and Uncle’s
bank took them all in, and they haven’t a cent left. As
for the men, they range all the way from tank-sinkers to
teachers, but there are only, so far as we can see, about
six business men of any promise among the lot, and they
have got big overdrafts with hardly any visible security—
all except one, who seems to have been rushed in at the
last moment and his good red gold grabbed just in time
to pay the final dividend. Judging by the documents
put before us, the hank seems to have been utterly
mined long before that last dividend was paid and
before the directorate arose to present the last
glowing balance-sheet to the shareholders ; and now
there isn’t a coin or a prospect left, and hardly
even a shareholder who could pay a call if his teeth were
dragged out by way of encouragement. The Australian
Banking Co. seems to have lived upon the poorest,
hungriest crowd of widows, old men and orphans upon
record. If its one affluent shareholder can be utterly
cleaned out and melted down and sent to the Benevolent
Asylum under the unlimited clause - which will be brutally
rough upon him—there may be about enough to pay law
and liquidation expenses, but that seems to be absolutely
all.

Dear Bulletin, —Badly as the prospecting
grants may he handled in N.S.W., for bland idiocy the
Victo.ian Distributing Boards take the prize. I know of
one man on a barren, hog-ploughed northern diggings who
has lived on grants for years, and never turned over an
ounce of gold (raw material) in all the time. He and a
select few of the inhabitants paw about amongst the hills
for a few hours each day, and do a little t renching in
convenient places, but if they cut a reef they would be
too weary to do anything beyond earthing it up, and
knocking off for refreshments. So expert is this trick-
miner at working the Board for grants that when it was
rumoured he intended quitting the district, an agitated
deputation of residents waited upon him, and solemnly
besought him never to leave them. He was all they had
to depend upon.—E.D.

Mr. Godfrey, chairman of the shareholders of
Ex-Premier Munro s Victorian Real Estate Bank, says, on
the authority of liquidator Loader, that a picture of black
insolvency of a million sterling has now to be faced. The
Territorial Company had been taken over by the bank to
oblige some directors, and the Australian Property Asso-
ciation had been taken over to oblige others, and inflated
values had been kept up in the balance-sheets by the
directors to Hie very last. The La Hose Estate was
purchased by Mr. John Woods for £28,000, and he sold it
to the bank for £54,000. The widow of Mr. J. Woods de-
clared to him (Mr. Godfrey) that Mr. Woods had informed
her that he had purchased the estate for Mr. Munro and
for his convenience, and that none of the profit had gone
into his (Mr. Woods) pocket. Mrs. Woods made a declara-
tion to this effect!

“The great financial policy of Melbourne
directors is to be solemnly mute about jobbery for which
outside shareholders have to suffer.” —(Extract from
“Wild Cat Column” of Bulletin, published July 7th).
“That the refusal of the liquidators to allow Mr. G.
Godfrey to proceed with Ins examination and investiga-
tion into the affairs of the company, and the ground of
such refusal is, in the opinion of this meeting, calculated
to prevent the discovery of matters which should he dis-
closed to the shareholders.”—(Resolution passed at meet-
ing of shareholders in Real Estate Bank, on July 7th).

The story of how Warner (the Safe Cure) bled
some London Stock Exchange “hears” has not been made
very public in Australia. The Cure was floated as a
limited company a while hack, and in due course the
shares were steadily forced down. Then Warner, the
chief holder, silently bought and bought until he was in
a position to demand delivery of more scrip than had
been issued, and the price of Safe Cure Company shares
rose to a fabulous figure. Warner made a fortune,
and a lot of brokers were more or less ruined before they
got out of the corner.

London Bankers’ Magazine has some caustic
remarks on the measure of Repudiation passed by the
Victorian Legislature last December, on Munro's motion,
in regard to building-societies, and those remarks only

The Muldiva silver mine, N.Q., now seems in a

Nambucca Heads (Northern N.S.W.) mine,
which has been struggled with for over three years, lias a
competent manager, who reports that he will clean-up in
a fortnight and then pay a dividend. It is said there are
1000 tons at grass, and that the ore running through the
chlorination plant goes from 8 to llozs. to the ton. We
hops it’s all true, for we have heard people say that the
mine is a mass of arsenical and iron pyrites, which in
some places will go many ounces and in many others only
dwts.

At last mining science nears the time when gold
will be profitably extracted from antimony. Thousands
of tons of 50 to 60 per cent, antimony ore containing
gold have been sent away from N.S.W. without any
allowance being made therefor. Perhaps the field most
noted in N.S.W. for auriferous antimony is Hillgrove,
which was first worked for antimony only. It has been
customary there to sell ore containing 2oz. of gold for the
price of the antimony alone ! Antimony, too, steadily
rises in value, and if the huge charges for the pro-
tection of agents, brokers and purchasers, were only
reasonably reduced hundreds of men would find employ-
ment in the working of the ore.

A correspondent writes, apropos of some Bulle-

ager has died suddenly, and that his last business com-
munication contained a request that 1000 shares in the
mine he had bought might be made out in small scrip, as
he was giving them to his children. “I write these few
lines in justice to his memory,” continues our corres-
pondent, “ to show that if his reports were good lie
believed in what he wrote and put his hard earnings into
the venture.”

A cake weighing 1724 ozs. is the result of three
weeks crushing from the Aladdin’s Lamp mine, Lucknow,
N.S.W. In many quarters the mine is described ns
“looking well;” in another that the lode from which
these rich yields are coming “is circumscribed by old
workings at each end.” More astonishing still that this
latter report, if false, remains officially uncontradicted,
particularly in view of the fact that the property is 011
the London market.

Thus Mr. Cann, the Broken Hill miners’
member:—“l can find you hundreds in Broken Hill who
have been disabled for months at a stretch, and some of
them for life ; no man should be allowed to work in those
mines longer than two years. Many die suddenly, some
in as many months. The refore the harder they work—
and that is what contracting means, or why introduce it ?
—the more poisonous fumes and lead-dust they inhale,
which is simply shortening their lives or killing them-
selves. In comparison to the numbers engaged in con-
tract or day work there are 10 contractors injured to
every one engaged on day work, and the contractors
working in the safest places. Therefore it will he a
hundred times worse if they start contracting in the
slopes. To say the men loaf and sleep is a reflection 011
the management, for one mine had 48 “ bosses ” under-
ground to look after 16SC miners, and a good number of
those working on the surface, but it is only 35 men per
man, and considering they are working within the lode
across three, 40a blocks they can surely keep that number
ao work, which they do, I promise you.

The Golden Gully mine at Ironbarks, N.S.W.,
is a patchy concern, in that respect resembling Lucknow,
the richest gold being in calcile associated with iron
pyrites. Its shares have varied from pounds to pence
pounds when the mine had nothing to recommend it hut
a patch, and pence when it had been well opened up. It
lias boon saved from liquidation by a complete plant and
a capable, economical mining manager. There are few
better worked mines in N.S.W. The ore is at present
contained between two clay vein walls, and consists of
irregular veins of calcite quartz and pyrites. The whole
body is crushed and pays. By this means a bonanza may
ha struck at any moment. There arc many yarns—mostly
lies—concerning the phenomenal richness of this mine in
the early days. The surface scarifying indicates that
there were many good things found. * 10.000 diggers were
there in the alluvial days. At present the mine is practi-
cally shut down for want of rain, which, like the field, is
patchy. It has not rained there for seven months while
at Orange, 30 miles away, there has been an abundance.

A tin-pot town like Ipswich, England, can float

wo must offer straight security. Let N.S.W. Treasurer
See, for instance, apply for a million or two to lock the
Darling, with the transaction as cover, and we prophesy
a phenomenal success. Or, better still, try the experi-
ment with N.S.W. irredeemable debentures bearing 4 per
cent., and a dozen contractors will accept the greenbacks,

Women at Trials.
WHY LADIES-FLOCK TO COURT.
A CLEAR DEFINITION OF THK CAUSES WHICH
MAKE WOMEN SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO EMOTION,
The New York “Sim” lias an able editorial in
which it seeks to show why some women love to
attend sensational or murder trials. It says:—
“Women arc not stirred at all by many of the
occurrences which agitate men, but when a case
involving life and death comes up—a tragic case
—and more especially when it has about it a
mystery in which a woman is concerned, and a
woman of the more refined society, they follow its
course with an intensity-of interest greater than
men feeb It is akin to the fascination which a
fictitious tragedy on the stage'has for women, and
for women more than men. It is a luxury for
many good women to have their tenderest feelings
of sympathy aroused. They enjoy going tu
funerals, and wiping away tears shed in unison
with those of sorrowing relatives. The plays that
wring the heart are more attractive for them than
the comedies which provoke merriment. They
delight in having their feelings aroused to the
highest pitch.
This is all undoubtedly true, but there is a cause
far back of all this. It is a cause which has its
origin in the life and condition of the women
themselves. Most women are weak, and not in
good health. When a woman is sickly, her feel-
ings are quickly aroused, and she suffers keenly.
This is the real actual cause of it all. Women
should not suffer. They are designed by nature
for happiness, not miseiy. And yet too often it
is continual suffering when there is a certain
relief.
Read the experience of a Hamilton lady—
Mrs. Mary Ann Austin says:—For 20 years I
was a sufferer from a complicated and serious
affection of the kidneys and liver. I have had
medical attendance from doctors in Melbourne
and also in the country, and have taken all kinds
of medicines, many of which contained mercury,
which have destroyed my teeth and in other ways
injured my system. The doctors wanted me to
undergo on operation, but 1 would not, knowing
full well 1 should never recover from it. So I
suffered on from year to year, not one of them
doing mo any good. My constitution was
shattered. My urine contained a large per-
centage of albumen and sediment whilst down my
back and left side the pains were almost unbear-
able. Soon after coming to Hamilton my husband
got one of Messrs. Warner and Co.’s pamphlets,
and, After reading several testimonials from
prominent men and women who had received good
from Warner’s Safe Cure, he advised me to try it.
Before I had taken many bottles I felt a decided
change for the better. I continued its use, and
was pleased to notice that I was growing stronger
and stronger every day. lam now able to attend
to my household duties and enjoy life. I, a" 1
fully convinced that but for Warner’s Safe Cure I
should he in my grave.
Is this an isolated experience? By no means!
It is precisely what hundreds of other ladies have
found true in their experience. It shows that if
women continue to suffer, if the trials of life weigh
them down when they should bo joyful, they have
themselves only to blame. There is a means of
relief, of restoration. It is pure, it is safe, it is »
woman’s best friend. By its rise she can be
enabled to withstand the ills of life, and secure
both health and happiness.

Tales of the Early Days.
BY PRICE WARUNG.
No. XI.-Parson Ford's Confassional.
(FOR THE bULLETIN.)
lb is beyond question that Parson Ford’s
resolve to keep up the amount of his fee for per-
forming marriages was responsible for the annoy-
ance which visited him on the occasion of our
story.
Eight pounds sterling was his fee. 1 arson
Knopwood would do the work for three and take
payment in currency; and it was generally the
easiest thing for an expert bridegroom to relieve
the old man of the money as lie was returning
home the same evening. When Parson Bob per-
formed the ceremony, he invariably celebrated the
event at the Hole in the Wall, the favourite public
house, where his welcome was always warm and
his chalk-score deep, and he would seldom proceed
homewards to Cottage Green till the everlasting
stars came out in their glory and flaunted their
drunkenness in his shame-stricken eyes. At least
that was what the cheery old chaplain used to say
as he stumbled over Macquarie-street cobble-
stones. “ Wheresh O-rion ? Shure I saw O-rion
(hie) jush now !—’sh gone! Shtrange—th’
bleshed (hie) stars dansh about so. Tell
Gov-en-or !” And then perhaps the bridegroom,
who had paid him about eleven o’clock that morn-
ing <£3 in paper notes or dollars, would take his
arm respectfully to help the reverend gentleman
along—and himself to the £3. Sometimes, indeed,
the bridegroom would not wait to tender his
assistance. This was when the fee had been paid
in forged notes, as several times happened.
Now, Parson Ford was a steady, pure and sober
man, and was not in the least inclined, when he
became Principal Chaplain on Bobby Knopwood’s
official retirement, to view with aught but dis-
pleasure the irregularities which his predecessor
had tolerated. He never got drunk ; he knew the
difference between forged currency notes and
general currency by the “feel”—lie could tell by
the touch, so he said, any one tradesman’s notes
from every other man’s and he went home
by dusk, or if detained after dark by pastoral
duty, only after he had emptied the contents of
his pockets and his fob into the keeping of a trusty
acquaintance or officer of the garrison. Conse-
quently, being possessed of these defects, he was
not at this time beloved by the lower, or, indeed,
any orders of society. Not till lafcbr did even the
official classes come to believe in him. A com-
munity in which the heads liked to be drunk
by mid-day, where matrimonial arrangements
seldom were entered into except for the pur-
pose of securing an additional grant of land or
a right to other property, and where it was un-
safe for a person to be out of doors after nightfall,
because of his liability to be robbed, if not by un-
official criminals, by the men of the watch, was
not prepared to take to its bosom at once a strong-
minded cleric, whose pockets were never worth
robbing, who would not drink to excess, whose
only vice was snuffing, and who was so much of a
Puritan that he had even admonished his Honor
the Lieutenant-Governor for having a plurality of
paramours. And when Parson Ford was so ill-
advised as to raise the marriage-fee to eight pounds
sterling, he placed the coping-stone to the edifice
of his unpopular life. One and all, high and low,
Lieutenant-Governor and lumber-yard transport,.
who would not have married his “ jomat ’ if the
marriage-fee had been nothing, indignantly re-
sented the step.
Why people who disdained marriage should
have been thus irritated, we do not positively
know. We can only suppose it was by reason of
that perverse trait of humanity which prompts it to
value the thing which is beyond reach. If only a
few couples could get married nearly everybody
would either wish to go through the ceremony or
affect the desire to do so. Perhaps some such
consideration had influenced Parson Ford in rais-
ing his fee. He assessed matrimony at a pecuniary
value far beyond the reach of the mass of persons,
and instantly they began to denounce the avarice
and the injustice and the wickedness which pre-
vented them from obtaining the blessing of the
Church on their very irregular alliances. They
forgot they had not rushed to the altar when the
terms were only three pounds.
# # *
“ I hear, Mr. Ford,” remarked his Honor,
as the parson paid him the usual morning visit
exacted from all Hobart Town gentlemen who
drew pay from the Colonial Chest, “that you
have caused it to be known that your marriage-
fee is to be eight pounds in future?”
“That is my fixture, your Honor,” replied
the chaplain.
“ But I do not know whether I can allow it!
You know that the Governor in Sydney has fixed
the fee at four pounds?”
“Guineas, your Honor,” gently corrected the
parson. “But that is within two described
parishes. I am sure of my legal rights on the
matter.”
“But the moral effect, Mr. Chaplain the
effect! Have you sufficiently thought of that ?
A heavy fee is—ahem —an impediment to
marriage !”
One great virtue had Parson Ford. He looked
over a lot of things in persons of authority, but,
when put on his nettle, he never winced before a
Governor, whether he was only a “ Lieutenant,”
or whether he was the omnipotent ‘‘General.” He
faced his Honor now, and said distinctly, with an
uncourtier-like acidity of tone: “Would it have
proved so in your case, your Honor ? If so, I’ll
reduce it !”
And his Honor took the unpleasant thrust
pleasantly. His wine-reddened face was not
unusually flushed as he responded: “Well, well,
if you must have it so, you must, I s’pose, Mr.
Ford. But don’t you think you can make it cur-
rency, instead of sterling.’ *
“ With all respect, sir, I do not think I can.
My object is to make the ceremony valued in the
eyes of the people, and I conceive there is no
better way of doing it than to attach an expense
to its performance. You have seen, your Honor,
that Mr. Knopwood’s low charges did not
encourage marriages. Now, we will see what my
method will do.”
“Very well, Mr. Ford, very well, have your
own way. I think you are mistaken, but it’s your
look-out, and not mine. I’m not —h’m —my
brother’s keeper—of his morals, at all events.
That’s your duty.”
And with this, his Honor bowed his reverence
out, helped himself to a glass of Spanish wine
from a bottle which, one of a dozen, had been
presented to him by his former comrade-in-arms,
John Macarthur, in Sydney—Capt’n John had
bought it at a sale of certain prize booty in the
year ’5, and treasured it greatly—and set to work
to devise a scheme by which to revenge himself
upon the clergyman. Davey was not given to
vindictiveness, but he dearly liked a jest, and when
by the same stroke he could have both his joke
and his revenge, he would have fallen below the
level of his drunken, rollicking, immoral old self
if he had refrained from applying it. He had all
the qualities of a good Governor except dignity,
firmness, purity, honour, sobriety and mag-
nanimity.
As the result of his reflections he outlined a
plan wliich, in the bosom of his irregularly con-
stituted family-circle at Government House, was
fairly elaborated that same nighty It was neces-
sary, you see, for him to use an intermediary in
the business. He rather prided himself on his
free and easy manners. Had he not made his
debut in the colony in his shirt-sleeves, excusing
himself on the score of its being too hot to
wear full regimentals? Had he not established
the custom of drinking and smoking in court ?
Was it not he who had stopped the trial-gang on
their way to the wharf, and treated each of the
unfortunates to a drink of rum-punch and a
churchwarden pipe at Half-Hanged Jack’s beer-
shop? Did he not accept kindly their thankful
“ God bless yer Honor ! ” and wish them in
return a fair trial, and, if God and the Judge
pleased, an easy death ? And was it not, too, his
identical old blackguard self who, instead of
enclosing to Sydney with the depositions of evi-
dence against a convicted forger the forged note
for threepence— put tbe note, and therefore the
evidence, into the fire, with the remark that a
throat that could give out “Tom Dowling ” so
well, was too good to be fitted with a rope neck-
lace? As a matter of fact, “ free and easy ” was
an absurdly weak term to apply to Lieutenant-
Governor Davey’s relaxed manners. Neverthe-
less, he felt it was “not quite the cheese’’—the
phrase is not ours but the Governor’s —for him to
place himself in direct communication with the
principal, in the plot he had contrived for the dis-
comfiture of Parson Ford. “ No, Julia,” he said
to the presiding madam of the week—his two
“ ladies ” took week about in doing the honours of
his private table (his legal family living quite
apart)—“it won’t be quite the cheese, my duck,
for me to see the little dears at the factory.
One of you will have to do that for me.”
“ Oh,” simpered madam —she was the identical
pretty piece of frailty respecting whom Captain
Colnett, of H.M.S. Glatton, had quarrelled with
Governor King,t and the twelve years since the
row had only matured her charms—“ anythin’ to
please yer, dear Gov’nor —an’ really, ye know,
none of us leddies like Parson Sniff an’ Snuff !
Bobby’s my ’dea of a parson. Ain’t he your’s,
dear Gov’nor ? ’
“I’m with ye, madam, in everything, as ye
know,” replied the Governor —whose gallant
speeches were not yet intermingled with hic-
coughs. “Ah, old Bobby never interfered
between me an’ ye, did he, dear ? But ye’ll attend
to the Factory, Ju., without fail before Monday
evening? Ye know, ’twould never do for his
Honor, the Gov., to be known in the business.”
“Oh, lud, your Honor, how squeamish we’re
gettin’ all at once,” tittered the sorceress of the
week ; “ why, ye'll be turnin’ saint yourself soon
an’ ’ll cry ‘ Fie !’ an’ blush when I do this.”
And, bending forward, she pressed with he..
ruby lips the vice-regal forehead. Madam Julia
knew the ways of Government in early Yande
monian days. Also which side her bread was
buttered. She was better off with Colonel Davey,
than with Captain Colnett, R.N. Immeasurably.*
# # *
What the official lights-o’-lovo achieved
the sequel will show. The Governor did, however,
make a specific contribution to the plot, but lie
kept the knowledge of it from his Cleopatras. He
chuckled mightily as he added his fragment of
fuel to the flame which was to scorch Parson Ford.
He penned the following :-
Private.
Government House, Thursday.
Reverend Sir, —The words that passed between us on a
delicate subject have afected me, and have not failed to
impres me. As one means of helping to releeve me from
his reverence’s sensure it is likely that a warm discourse
on the subject by which you will understand I mean the
Regular connections which your reverence does not
approve of, on Sunday coming, would strengthen my
hands, for I have come to the conclusion that my
honourable position does demand from me conduct which
would not remain open to your Reverence’s Objection.
Your Reverence’s obedient servant,
(Sd.) Thomas Davey, Lieult.-Gov.
To the Reverend Theophilus Ford,
at St. Davids Parsonage.
Like the illustrious Wellington, Colonel Davey
was weak in orthography and in grammar, but the
Rev. Mr. Ford was too well acquainted with
official eccentricities of the kind to dwell upon
those features of the document. What impressed
him was the possibility it held out of a reform in
popular morals. And he resolved to accept the
hint “and to give it ’em warm. ’
It was on the succeeding Sunday that he rose to
the occasion. It was the first Sunday in the
month, consequently a muster-Sunday, and pretty
well everybody in Hobart Town was crowded into
the church or within its precincts. A muster-
Sunday for the bond or ticket-of-leave classes
was, of course, compulsory, and those who were
emancipated or “free” by “servitude,” were
almost as regular in attendance, for, besides the
fun of the thing, there was the gratification of wit-
nessing the subjection of others to a procedure
once so galling to themselves. Then the few
people who “came free” and the “garrison
ladies” came also to witness the spectacle.
It was so amusing, you will understand, to
note the distress of some poor “ticket-of-
leave,” as, from some more or less real pecca-
dillo, his “ticket” was withdrawn, perhaps
a little home or business sacrificed, and he himself
re-consigned to the purgatory of the lumber-yard
or the hell of the road-gang. In an epoch when
popular entertainments were rare, the Sunday
muster was highly valued by all except those who
were compelled to attend it.
On this Sunday the muster was before Church.
The Muster-Master, as though in anticipation
of the coming storm, was righteously indignant in
the cases of a couple of dissolute fellows, who,
having permission to marry, had gone no nearer
the altar than the broomstick. They pleaded
Parson Ford’s increased fee, but ’twas no use.
Their tickets were withdrawn, and they were
ordered to present themselves liefore the Police
Magistrate in the morning for sentence.
This incident had so agreeably entertained the
“ free” people “ irregularly-attached ” or not, that
they would have been prepared to enjoy even a
* “ Currency ” and “ Sterling”—The difference in value
in Davey’s time varied from 12j to 25 per cent.
t Considering that, as a rule, Rusden, the historian,
damns the cause he advocates, it is an unfortunate thing
for Governor King’s fame that Rusden defends his conduct
in the Colnett case. King’s action appears, however,
eminently creditable to him, even in the light of the
superior morality of this generation. Tested by contem-
porary canons, it reflected infinite honour upon him. I
will tell the whole story someday, chiefly by the aid of
Colnetc’s own manuscript.-— Author.

less thrilling sermon than that Mr. Ford preached
to them. Therefore, when he gave out his text
from Ecclesiastes vii. and 2Gth—
And I find more bitter than death the woman whose
heart is snares and nets, and tier hands as bonds ; whoso
pleaseth God shall escape from her ; but the sinner shall
be taken by her.
they settled down with an unusual zest. They
knew i-y instinct something interesting was
coming.
* # #
Illustrating In's theme by pretty well
every Scriptural passage having the remotest
relation to it, the preacher denounced the
iniquity of “ irregular connections.” Then,
by way of contrast, he painted the virtues
of the typical British home, drew tears
from many eyes by a description of the
conjugal felicity which prevailed in the palace
of the Sovereign—he was discreetly silent
as to the Regent—and, having insinuated a refined
advertisement of his reasons fur raising the mar-
riage-fee—“ that which costs nothing or next to
nothing,” he said, “is never valued,” ho con-
cluded with a most touching peroration. With
eyes alternately directed to the roof and upon the
vice-regal pew, he thanked Heaven that he had it
from the best, lie might say the very best, authority
that henceforth the Local Representative of that
pure and pious Personage whose virtues added
lustre to the Crown of England, contemplated
reflecting in his person and establishment the
example of his Gracious Sovereign. With so
striking an exemplar on the spot, lie reminded his
hearers that there would be no excuse for their
permitting their irregular unions to remain un-
blessed by the Church and unsanctioned by the
Law.
The effect was tremendous. New South Wales
and Van Demouia in the early days had, of
course, no opportunity of knowing how a Caring-
ton con'd throw an aristocratic splendour over the
gallows, or how a Hamilton could transform by
grace of manner a niggardliness of expenditure
into a refined economy ; but yet they possessed,
all things considered, as devoted a regard for the
representative of the throne as we can claim
to-day. The eye of the congregation seemed fixed
upon the broad shoulders of the Lieutenant-
Governor as ho sat a few yards away from the
pulpit. A kindly shadow from a pillar prevented,
however, all save those in the immediate vicinity
observing that the vice-regal form shook as though
with suppressed emotion. Frequent applications
of a yellow handkerchief to his eyes further testi-
fied to the impression the sermon had made upon
him. Was the Colonel really going to reform?
Was he smitten with sorrow for the past, and
moved by passionate desire for better things in
the future? It seemed si, indeed, and one portly
merchant a conditional pardon man from Sydney-
side—reflected ruefully that, eight pounds or no
eight pounds, he’d be obliged to follow the
Governor’s example, if the groat man really meant
to abandon bis liar- m.
But the merchant and those who noticed his
Honor’s emotion, need not have been afraid.
True, he did wipe tears from Ins eyes, but—it
pains us t say it—they were of mirth. The
Colonel of Marines was all the time wondering to
himself how Jess and Ju were taking the sermon.
He had never gone so far as to instal them in
the vice regal pew—the ladies of his family proper
would have drawn the lino at that—but he knew
they were in church. He’d have given a day’s pay
in sterling money, and not in those rascally
rupees which were worth no more than 80 per
cent, of their nominal value, to have been able to
look round and wink at the sweet creatures. But
that he dare not do: it would have spoilt the
sport, for did lie catch their eyes in return ho
would to a certainty burst into laughter Accord-
ingly, lie had to wait till afternoon.
• # •
The Parson dined with his Excellency and
received the latter’s great compliments for the un-
stinted and fervid morality of the discourse. The
Colonel now coincided with Mr. Ford as to the
wisdom of the increased fee, and expressed a hope
that not many months would elapse before it
would be—er— as difficult to find an irregularly-
attached couple in Hobart Town as a needle in the
proverbial truss of hay! And the joy which is
generated by the consciousness that a good work
is meeting with the applause of the high and
mighty settled upon Parson Ford’s soul as he
bade his Honor good-bye and betook himself to
the church for afternoon service. It was a joy
undimmed by the least doubt as to the sincerity
of the Governor’s conversion.
After second service he was asked to tea at the
table of one of the two married ladies of the garri-
son. The garrison was, matrimonially considered,
very badly organised indeed. With the exception
of two, the ladies who looked after the comfort of
the officers, drawing married men’s lodging and
fuel allowances, however frequently they quarrelled
among themselves, had one characteristic in
common. They possessed no certificate of mar-
riage—at Fast, they owned no certificates that
sanctified their present relationships. And now,
in consequence of Parson Ford’s sermon, the vir-
tuous and duly married two were more determined
than ever to look down upon their unlicensed sisters
of the quarters. Accordingly, as a preliminary,
they mutually arranged an applausive tribute to
that dear man, the clergyman, who at last had
put his foot resolutely down “on the shocking, the
really too shocking, state of things that prevailed
in the town, and particularly within our brother
officers’ quarters, you know, dear.” Mrs. Lieu-
tenant Bobbin had wished to do the honours, and
invited Mrs. Captain D’Ewes, her sister in matri-
monial distinction, to take tea witli her and the
dear parson, but Mrs. Captain D’Ewes, by virtue
of her husband’s rank, pressed for the jprivilege
of first entertainment, which Mrs. Bobbin at once
effusively and affectionately conceded. And so at
half-past five o’clock the Rev. Theophilus found
himself seated at a table with Mrs. D’Ewes and
Captain D’Ewes, and Mrs. Bobbin and her Lieu-
tenant. It may be remarked, by the way, that
the Lieutenant’s experience of wedded life was
rather regarded in the town as strong evidence of
the advantages of single blessedness.
Mr. Ford having said grace (the circumstance
from its unusual nature deserves to be chronicled)
and accepted some of the hospitalities of the table,
his hostess lost no time in expressing her congratu-
lations cm his proper, very proper, course that
day. And did he really think IBs Honor would
alter the disgraceful, very disgraceful, condition
of Government House society?
“ I am, ma’am, firmly convinced in my own
mind he really contemplates a change of conduct,”
affirmed the parson.
“Then—then—those women . Oh, really,
Mr. Ford, I blush for my sex to think such things
are possible ! And will His Honor at once dismiss
them to the Factory ?’ Thus spoke the virtuous
Bobbin dame.
“1 am quite of opinion that he will do so. In
fact, I may tell you, in confidence, ladies, of
course, that I believe they have already been re-
turned there !”
No! exclaimed both ladies m a breath.
Indeed I think so. As I was taking oft my
surplice in the vestry, the matron of the factory
came in and said that the Governor s ladies -you
know, ina am, that the way those low-class women
Wlll B P eak of Lioso disgraces to their sex
“ Yes, indeed !” indignantly said Mrs. D’Ewes,
“ this misuse of words ought to bo put down !
And the matron said ?’’
“ That those sinful women had been driven out
to the factory. The matron bringing in the rest
of the Protestant women for afternoon service as
usual, met them half-way. They looked in a fine
fluster —to use Mrs. Chubb’s words—just as
though the consequences of their sin had at last
fallen upon them.”
“ Ah !” said Mrs. D’Ewes, “ there comes an end
to all wrong-doing sooner or later.”
“Why,” said the Lieutenant, “didn’t the
matron stop and ask them why they were going
out?”
“Oh, Lieutenant, you don't know what a
trouble ’tis to that poor woman to get those drabs
of factory girls to church ! she could not attend
to anything else ! She has to bring them in two
batches—morning and afternoon—for it would
take her whole staff to march the lot in together,
and she must, of course, leave two or three wards-
women behind to look after the sick ones. ”
“ We’d always tell off a corporal’s guard to help
her,” said Captain D’Ewes, flippantly. “ Our men
would not object to guard-duty there. ‘Guardians
of beauty, if not of virtue,’ and so on, eh, Bobbin? ’
Bobbin, with his spouse’s eye upon him, dare
not acquiesce verbally, but in his heart he
approved of his comrade’s sentiment. Of course,
their respective wives were not aware that among
the Lotharios of the camp, D’Ewes and Bobbin
were included, even though they were married.
Had he wished to reply, however, he would not
have found it possible to do so, for Mrs. D’Ewes
sharply remonstrated with her husband.
“ I think, Captain,” she said, “ that you should
keep your wit for the low associates of the barrack-
room. Remeiflber, a clergyman is present, if you
have no respect for ladies. And now, dear Mr.
Ford, 1 should like so much to know whether
those—those creatures are really at the Factory !
You, I suppose, will find out in due course ? ”

“ Oh, yes,” broke in that ribald D’Ewes, “ to-
morrow’s your confessional day is it, Mr. Ford? ”
“My what—sir?” returned the astonished
Parson, who was nothing, if ho was not a sturdy
Evangelical. ... . .
“ That, I believe, sir, is the term given in the
town to your—ah—method of interrogating those
frisky young madams at the Factory, of whom
you’re so fond ? ”
“Sir ! ” exclaimed the insulted Parson, rising.
“ D'Ewes ! ” appealed his better-half.
“Captain D’Ewes!” ejaculated the horrified
Mrs. Bobbin, whose husband simply chuckled to
himself under cover of the storm.
And though D’Ewes apologised, and hand-
somely withdrew the imputation, which, he
averred, was merely a jocular nothing, the
Parson’s sense of injury was not appeased until
both Mrs. D’Ewes and Mrs. Bobbin had consented
to accompany him to the Factory on the morrow,
“ Then, ladies, I beg you’ll interrogate every
woman for yourselves. Ask them what questions

As a simple fact, Parson Ford could not havn
played more nicely into his adversaries’ handi
than when he extended that invitation. Davev’i
plan had been merely to suggest a very nanghtv
idea to the frail fair ones iiuMrs. Chubb’s charge
and to trust to chance for the result finding its
way to the knowledge of the townspeople. °Bu(i
here Ford himself had provided the means for his
own discomfiture.

On the Monday afternoon, the Rev. Theo-
philua, accompanied by Mesdames D’Ewes and
Bobbin, was respectfully Welcomed by Mrs.
Chubb. As the matron made her final curtsey
she said :
“ Twelve new ones, your Rev’runce !”

. Mrs. Chubb simpered and looked down. “Yes,
sir !’she said.

garrison ladies, “ of course, you don’t understand
what Mrs. Chubb means ?”

Well, I must tell you, ma’am. You know, of

Factory from service ?”

The twelve girls—they were nearly all on
the youthful side of womanhood—were ranged in
a row, each standing by the foot of her pa let.
Some were quivering with suppressed shame—or
laughter. Others were biting their lips. But all
were silent till the interrogation began,
Humming a hymn, Parson Ford walked up and
down. His back was to the line of women, and
consequently lie did not see the startled looks
which were bestowed upon him and then upon
each other by the two ladies. By the time, hovv-
ever, he turned in his walk, each int rroga ive
had examined her second girl, and as she
obtained a reply, she glanced so strangely at the
clergyman that lie could not help but notice her
manner. He put the singularity of the look down,
however, to some surprising revelation. “Revela-
tions ” under the like circumstances were so
common, that they had long since ceased to be
surprising to him,
As Mrs. Bobbin interrogated her third girl,
Mrs. D’Ewes finished the examination of her
fourth. They exchanged a look of horror—then

moving simultaneously into the centre of the
room, they exclaimed together.
“Oh, Mr. Ford! You wretch!” called Mrs.
p'E’ves.
“ Mr. Ford, you’re a hypocritical villain !”cried
Mrs. Bobbin, and she hysterically searched for
her handkerchief.
“Ladies!” exclaimed Parson Ford, not be-
lieving his ears.
“ Yes, sir, I’m glad I came to-day to unmask a
scoundrel ! Each of these four girls says you
are the father of her child !” cried Mrs. D’Fwes.
“ Madam ! ”
“ And—oh—infamous !—these three girls all
gay—they—owe—their—ruin to you ! ” gasped
Mrs. Bobbin, in tears.
“ And I say the same ! ” said a girl as yet un-
interrogated.
“He’s the father of my child, too!” said
another.
“ And of ours ! ’’ cried the rest in chorus.
Under this terrible avalanche of accusation
Parson Ford was dumb !
* * #
Governor Davey and his “leddies” had
calculated only on surprising Parson Ford himself
—by bribing the girls with a ticket-of leave apiece
—to allege that he, the clergyman, was responsible
for her presence in the lying-in ward of the Fac-
tory. They had not contemplated so astonishing
a for their little plot, as was achieved
through Ford’s invitation to the garrison ladies.
Not for many years was Ford allowed to forget
this episode. Governor Arthur, fifteen years
afterwards, referred, at a Birthday dinner, to
Parson Ford as one of the “fathers of the colony,”
and was immensely surprised at the uproarious
laughter his compliment elicited from all colonists
present—save Ford.
Tired.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The coroner drew aside the sheet, and the
jury gazed stolidly at the bodies. Two of them
bent forward, curious; but the rest took the scene
as a matter of course. They were men of the
type which the will of necessity turns out by
thousands; decent enough, but hardened and
brutalised by constant conflict with the world.
Men of imagination would have been awed ; they
saw only two naked corpses on a table, and
wondered how long they would be kept away from
work. Those profaned temples of the Deity had
no message for them.
The blind had been lifted, and the morning sun
flooded the room with light. No blotch, no
defacement on the bodies, was hidden. They lay
as the doctors had left them, and the last sad
offices were not yet performed. The woman had
been shot through the body, and just below the
breast was a small blue wound, round which some
clots of blood yet lingered. She was well-shaped
and comely, but thin and worn. The man was
cast in a robust mould, and his muscles were rigid
and strong. His head had been shattered by a
revolver-bullet. Yet his face, as well as the
woman’s, wore a smile—a smile which Death had
caught and fixed.
The coroner’s voice broke the silence. “Well,
gentlemen,” he said, “I suppose you have seen
enough.” He replaced the sheet, not irreverently ;
and in a minute the jury were back in the public-
house parlour.
ihe woman’s name was Agues Lines,
borne three years before she had taken the subur-
ban cottage where she lived. She was a lady—
the neighbours were sure of that—refined and
quiet m manner, speaking little and making no
friends. She had obtained employment as day-
governess, which brought her sufficient to live
upon and no more. She seemed barely 30, yet
already her hair was turning grey, and there was
a settled sadness on her. Where she came from,
nobody knew.
With her lived a little girl for company, the
daughter of a local tradesman. On the night of
the crime this girl had gone to bed at nine o’clock;
Mi«s Innes stayed up reading, as was her habit.
How long the little girl slept she did not know.
She was awakened by the noise of two shots in
the sitting-room. As soon as she dared, she crept
softly to the back-door, and ran home, wild with
terror. Her father found a policeman; they
returned to the house and found Miss Innes lying
on a sofa, quite dead. By her side, upon the
floor, lay the man, his hand resting on a revolver
which had two chambers discharged. He was
alive when they burst in, but died five minutes
afterwards. The policeman thought that, in
dying, he feebly murmured the name “ Agnes.”
In the mans pocket was a bank pass-book
showing .£SOOO to the credit of William Turner.
Ihe authorities in Adelaide found this genuine.
But the bank could not say who William Turner
was, nor did persistent advertisement bring a
W£ls asce Hained that he had reached
Melbourne by a yessel which arrived at 9 o’clock
oil the fatal evening, and the cab-driver was found
who brought him from the wharf to the house,
which they had discovered with difficulty. He
carried a small black bag. This was all that was
known. Regarding Miss Innes, the most thorough
search failed to bring to light a scrap of informa-
tion. She received no letters, the postman said.
All this was strange ; yet the circumstances of
the crime left no doubt as to the motive. The
case was very plain, as the coroner pointed out.
Let us see.
• # #
When the man stepped from the cab he
was trembling. It was 10 o’clock, the street was
quiet, and when the rattle of the wheels was no
longer heard in the distance the stillness became
oppressive. The night was dark and gloomy, and
as the man put his hand on the gate large drops of
rain began to fall. He did not raise the latch at
once, but stood gazing at the steady radiance of
the illumined pane As he watched a shadow
passed across it, and the man trembled yet more
violently.
Suddenly the door opened and the woman
stopped out on the verandah. “ Agnes !” he said,
rushing forward. She did not start nor cry, but
mutely accepted his embrace.
“I was expecting you, Will,”she said, “ though
you have been long in coining.” They entered
the house together and the door closed.
“Agues,” said the man, “since we parted I
have been working hard. For a long time Fortune
was unkind. Lately I have prospered, and now I
am rich, as you and I look upon riches. Agnes,
you will forget the past and be my wife?”
She looked at him steadily.
“ Agnes,” he went on, with increasing emotion,
‘the scoundrel who blasted my life and yours
lacks for nothing. He is a successful man and a
popular man. The newspapers praise him ; lie is
honoured and respected. In the eyes of the world,
were I to reveal myself, I am a villain and a
criminal. There is no hope that I will ever be
cleared. But, Agnes, you know me and trust mo
—you will be my wife ?”
Her bosom heaved, but she made no .reply.
“Agnes,” continued the man, “we may be
happy yet. I have a house among the hills,
where few people pass. You can see the valley
stretched below, with the township, and the river
g'eatning in the distance. No storms came there ;
the air is clear and cool ; the flowers bloom wild ;
in the night you would think to touch the stars,
they hang so low. Agnes, we may be happy yet.”
He threw his arms round her, and their lips
met. She made no effort to repel him,
“Agnes,” he said, “holding her hands, and
gazing yearningly at her, “ what is your answer ? ”
The woman spoke quietly, looking into his eyes.
“I have waited a long time for you, Will,” she
said, “ and I would not have died till ypu came. I
love you more than all the world, ‘A ill. I would
have been your wife years ago, when he came
between us. When you fled, Will, it crushed my
soul. I would have died, but I knew you would
come back. Somehow I have lived till now, and
I am glad of it.”
“Then you will come with me, Agnes?” said
the man,
“Not now, Will,” she answered. “It is too
late. lam tired.”
‘ But think, Agnes. You cannot live as you
are doing ; you cannot,”
“No, Will, for you must kill me before you go.
I have seen you. Now I will die.”
“Agnes,” said the man, passionately, “you do
not know what you say.”
“ Will, I have loved you all my life, since we
were boy and girl together. Since I have been
able to think, my dearest wish was to be with you
always. But life is too hard. Shall we go back
into the world which has been so cruel to us,
which has parted us for these long, long years?
Can we trust our happiness to it; can you and I,
who have been so miserable, expect that it will
not make us miserable to the end ?”
“ Agnes ,” he said, and stopped.
“It is better to die now,” she went on. “ Why
should we let the world triumph over us? If you
know what I have suffered ! But you will not
leave me now. You will let me die here, with
you. Will, lam so tired.”
“ Perhaps it is better,” he said, slowly.
“It is better,” she said. “Death seems so
pleasant, Will, seeing you. Just think, never to
struggle, never to suffer, to be always quiet. It is
not worth while living, when one is so happy dead.
Remember I love you, Will, and kill me.”
Her speech fascinated him. He turned to his
bag, and took out a revolver.
She watched him intently. “I have always
loved you, Will,” she said. “ Now I know you
love me. Kiss me once, Will.”
He obeyed.
She took his hand and placed it to her heart. It
was beating calmly.
“Just there, Will,” she said. “Remember, I
love you.”
Without speaking he raised the revolver and
fired. She fell backwards on the sofa with an
ineffable smile. In a moment he had fired again
and fell at her side.
* * #
“Gentlemen,” the coroner said again,,
“ the case is very plain. You have heard the evi-
dence. The man was probably some discarded
lover, though of his antecedents there is no trace.
He has sought out the unfortunate woman, who
was honest and hard-working, and endeavoured to
persuade her to accept his addresses. She refused,
and in a fit of jealous rage he shot her and then
himself. I think this is the view you will take.”
The jury agreed and gave a verdict of wilful
murder and suicide. Then they hurried back to
business.
And the two, who should have been buried
together, were separated in death.

The tendency of Capital is to foster the cheap labourer,
and in parts of Australia in a few years, unless the Labour
organisations have some practical effect, the white man
will surely be receiving coolie wages. It will be the same
as it is in the Territory at the present day, where no one
thinks of employing a white man except under compul-
sion, because there are so many Chinese prepared to do
whatever task it may be for a much smaller consideration

Lyrics of the Stage.
(The Man who hides under the Table.)
We wish to abolish a man
By imbecile merriment nourished,
Who ever since farces began
Has held on to favour and flourished.
The moment that person appears
Old stagers can give him his label:
They’ve known him a number of years
As the man who hides under the table.
No matter what name he is called
llis trousers are sure to be baggy,
His head is exceedingly bald,
His form either bloated or scraggy;
He plays the low-comedy clown,
And starts by inventing a fable,
And seldom the curtain conies down
Until he is under the table.
’Tis part of bis duty to flop
On his knees to the feminine gender,
Ho capers all over the shop
And stands on bis head in the fender;
As the only support of the plot
His motives are vague and unstable,
Cut he ties matters into a knot,
Does the man who hides under the tame.
Six people accuse him of deeds
Of which he has never a notion,
And then he says something that leads
To a scene of entangled commotion.
The girls on the furniture fall
Their shrieks take the lead in the babel,
Whilst the man who knows nothing at all
Is bound to hide under the table.
We wish to abolish that man—
The privileged joker and “ dammer’
Since farcical pieces began—
It ought to be done with a hammer.
In days that forever have fled
To laugh at his tricks we were able ;
But now it is time he was dead.
The man who hides under the table.
Thus a Torres Straits correspondent to
The Bulletin
Some time ago, the pearl-fishing industry being rather
slack in Torres Straits, Tommy Mullens, of Thursday
Island, determined to seek fresh fields and pastures new.
He accordingly sailed round to Dutch New Guinea in his
beloved craft, the Elsie, a 40-ton schooner-rigged yacht,
and a witch to sail, built on the Clyde to the order of an
English lord. Tommy was not long striking a patch m
Dutch waters. In two days he got a thousand splendid
shell (over £3CO worth), not including pearls. On the
morning of the third day, as he was cheerfully preparing
for another haul, a Dutch man-o’-war came round a point
and bore down on him to interrupt his little game.
Knowing that capture meant confiscation of his vessel
and belongings, as well as imprisonment to himself,
he resolved to “sherry” and so slipped cable and
crowded on every stitch cf canvas. Seeing his intention
the Dutch fired on him, a signal to heave to, but Thomas
didn’t heave—he had too much confidence in his craft.
There was not much wind blowing, the man-of-war gained
on the Elsie and commenced playing on her with a
machine-gun. At this the coloured crew all deserted the
deck and hid below, leaving Mullens alone at the helm.
The sliots were dropping all around and some even going
through the rigging. About this time a sudden squall
struck the Elsie, throwing her on her beam-ends, and
there being no crew to work the sails things were slightly
mixed, but the little craft staggered up again, and a
steady breeze springing up, sailed clean away from the
Dutch steamer, with Mullens frantically clutching the
helm with one hand and waving his adieus with the
other.— Baktk ax.
In a little Maori village near Coromandel
(M.L.) stands a roofless church, with a fallen
pulpit and a shrub growing out of the baptismal
font. There is a history attached to this ruined
edifice. Many years ago it was built by a con-
verted chief, and the inhabitants, in an outburst
of religious fervour, took up a subscription of
,£l5, and sent a certain native, named Te Wheoro,
to Auckland to buy for the preacher’s use the
finest big Bible he could find. But the best Bible
in the city cost only ,£O, so Wheoro, being a man
of great intelligence, invested the other <£9 in a
huge cask of rum. The undressed elders of the
flock approved of his purchase, and decided that,
with a view to the spreading of the Terewth,
the cask should stand in the vestry with a
pannikin attached, and every person who
attended service should have a drink as he
went in and another when coming out. Also, it
was resolved that there should be three services
every Sunday, and that any member showing
signs of intoxication should be fined 10?., the same
to be spent in more rum. After that for three
years the church prospered exceedingly, and the
cask kept full. But one Sunday the chief s
daughter took eight drinks of rum in close succes-
sion, and being promptly fined she told the elders
to go to perdition. Then she smashed the pulpit
and the desk, tore the big Bible to rags, took
seven more drinks, ran amok in the church,
staved in the cask, and went away and relapsed
into heathenism. The congregation fell off after
that, and presently broke up altogether. Then
hogs got into the sacred edifice, and the roof was
blown off by a winter gale, and the great religious
movement was altogether forgotten.
A correspondent sends us this grisly
story :
A convict named Butler is now in gaol at Auckland
(M.L.) as a victim of the tender passion and the irony of
fate. Years ago when Butler was young and rather
handsome he “went wrong” in some way or other, and
was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. The Maoriland
convicts work mostly out of doors at quarrying or road-
making, and are marched through the streets morning
and evening on their way to and from their work. There-
fore it came to pass that Butler “ mashed ” a little woman
who passed him every morning and every night, and after
a while they began to correspond. The girl left her
letters' under a certain stone near the quarry, and
Butler wrote answers surreptitiously and deposited
them in the same place. It was a pleasant
episode while it lasted, but suddenly the convict was
removed to another prison, and the two did not meet
again. When his term was up, however, he went out
with a firm resolve to marry the girl, and then, for the
first time, he learned that she had forgotten him
she was married. He went to Dunedin in pursuit of her,
with vengeance in his soul. After long search, he found
out where she lived and saw her, with her baby in her
arms, meet her husband on his return from work. Afler
well marking in his mind the cottage inhabited by
his lost lover, he went away, but returned that night and
murdered in their sleep the father, the mother, and the
child. He was captured a day or two later
and brought to trial, and at the trial the murdered
girl turned up whole and uninjured—the assassin
had made a mistake in the darkness, and gone to
the house next door. For some reason or other—l
forget how—he wasn’t hanged, but got off with life-long
imprisonment. His intended victim, however, was
ever afterwards haunted by the dread that he would get
over the gaol wall some dark night and finish the job he
had left undone, and at last she and her family removed
to Auckland to he heyond his reach. Then a paternal
Government kept shifting the convict from one gaol to
another till he also arrived at Auckland, and now he and
the woman he failed to butcher arc within half-a-mile of
each other, and if he should by any chance get loose for
a night he will probably find the right house this time.
Only the most unlucky of convicts chops up the wrong girl
twice in one lifetime.

The favourite Saturday afternoon pastime
of the “boys” in South Tasmania is a wood-
chopping contest. The timber is trimmed down
while it is standing until it measures two feet in
diameter; then, after being felled and cut into
lengths of about five feet, it is carted to the place
of competition. Each competitor chocks his log
to keep it from rolling, and then with a piece of
chalk or charcoal he marks on either side the
place and width of his cut. They handicap by
time, and for about six minutes the air is thick
with chips, while the roar of the “barrackers”
jars the ears of the delirious Victorian, and
makes him sigh for home, and the delicious
quietude of a football-match for the premiership.
The Tasmanian woodcutter loves his axe as a
yachtsman his boat, or a sportsman his gun,
always referring to it as “ she,” and he sharpens it
on an oilstone. Most people are content to look
at an axe to ascertain the fineness of its edge, bub
not so this enthusiast—he feels it with his thumb.
The record for cutting through a “ two-foot ” log
is said to be held by a Huon River artist, who
accompli shed the feat in 4 minutes 30 seconds !
and his first chip measured 18 inches in length,
and weighed nearly 281bs. ! The scientific axe-
man who sent that little chip spinning merrily in
the sunlight contemplates going to Chicago for the
purpose of giving exhibitions.
From Rudyard Kipling
At a halting-place In a gigantic gorge walled in by the
snows, a man reels from a tiny saloon into the midille ox
the track, where half-a-dozen dogs are chasing a pig on
the metals. lie is beautifully and eloquently drunk, lie
sings, waves his hands, and collapses behind a shunting
engine, while four of the loveliest peaks that the Almighty
ever moulded looked down upon him.
It is an eloquent picture, no doubt —the dogs, the
pig, and the unclean drunk among the everlasting
hills ; but we have seen worse even than that. It
was in Maoriland, beside the upper waters of
Lake Wakatipu. You could get a view of the
lake from the road that wound over the lulls
miles and miles of sinuous waters, cool and clear
as crystal, and green as a sea of emerald. the
mountains, just tipped with midsummer snow,
rose up from the water’s edge, and the trees stood
reflected head-down wards in the lake, and an
arrowy cataract rushed down one of the hills m a
sheet of foam. And we were just thinking of
how that nameless cataract had fled down that
same hillside when Abraham was alive, and how
it had been there in the times of Adam and Moses
and Gehazi, and how antiquity wasn’t even begun
when it started to foam along in its eternal night
—when we rounded a corner of the road, and
found a tall, hot Scotchman dressed in black with
a long belltopper, seated on a grassy bank cutting
his corns. He had taken off his boots and
was busy removing a particularly inflamed
excrescence with a pen-knife all streaked with
tobacco-juice. We didn’t enjoy the scenery after
that. And now, whenever we see or dream of a
lovely expanse of lake and mountain we seem to
see the silhouette of a Scotchman and a bell-topper
against the summer sky, and his bunions are there
among the flowers. We didn’t know him, and we
had nothing against his character, but the lank
Presbyterian who would cut his corns at the gates
of such a Paradise is an outrage upon all the finer
sentiments of humanity.
The Adonis of tlio Sydney police, Constable
Roy, who committed suicide the other day, was
to have left the force in three months and married
a Woolloomooloo public-house.
Perhaps the most (unintentionally) hum-
orous article ever written in support of woman
suffrage is to be found in Saturday fortnight’s
Sydney Daily Telegraph supplement, under the
heading “A Plea for Unity amongst Women.'’
There is a terrible row in Southern Maori-
land over the fact that the Sydenham Licensing
Committee, of which a Wesleyan clergyman
named Isitt is chairman, has closed up every
hotel in the district. Sydenham is a suburb of
Christchurch, and has a population of 12,000.
On 18th May the One-man-one-vote was
discussed again in the Commons. Had the Bill
been-accornpanied by a measure for securing equal
electoral districts, it is probable that it would
have passed its first stage. As it turned out, how-
ever, only 237 voted against it, to 189 who recorded
their views in its favour. Plural voting, even in
the stronghold of monopoly, will shortly be
doomed.
Dear Bulletin, —I don’t think any Aus-
tralian writer has noticed that John Dyer’s famous
poem “The Fleece,” published in 1757, contains a
remarkable prophecy with reference to our
country. According to the poet, English wool is
to be distributed over the world until —
That portion, too, of land, a tract immense,
Beneath the Antarctic spread, shall then be known,
And new plantations in its coast arise.
—Trice Waeung.
Dear Bulletin, —Apropos your bullock-
driver hero, referred to the other day, let me tell
about “Blind Tom,” (lame from childhood) at
Lefroy, Tasmania, who some 18 years ago was
accidentally shot in both eyes and rendered
instantly stone-blind. The poor fellow did not
take to the barrel-organ, etc., but stuck to his
calling, that of a wood-carter, lie knows the run
of the whole township, can fell a tree, choj) it up,
load his dray, harness his horses, all by himself.
His mother, who has kept a boarding-house ever
since the first rush broke out, supplied him with
a real good wife, her best servant girl, about 10
years ago, and Blind Tom has now a family of
eight, in the stepladder fashion, all being happy
and content. — Black Art.
