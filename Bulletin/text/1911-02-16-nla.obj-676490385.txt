The Conflict of Color
The Conflict of Color, by B. L. Putnam
Weale (Dymock’s), is a valuable essay on
a subject of first importance. The book
does not take rank with special studies such
as Lecky’s Rise of Rationalism in Europe,
Mahan’s Influence of Sea Power on History,
and Buckle’s fragment of a history of
civilization.
It is, however, the work of one who
knows Eastern Asia as well as Europe,
and it is the most comprehensive survey of
the racial question from a political point of
view that has been made since Pearson’s
National Life and Character.
In a long, general introduction Weale
roughly sketches the causes of the present
relations between the white and colored
races. He establishes, as a starting point
for his examination, that the loss of America
diverted British action to the East, and re-
sulted in Britain becoming the principal
factor in the present conflict of color.
.•
Though the antagonism which is rooted in
difference of color has Hared up inter-
mittently in Europe since the great struggles
of the Middle Ages, the whites long ago
ceased to regard the colored races seriously
as opponents. The development of Japan
has re-opened the question of racial suprem-
acy, and a danger cloud is rising in the East
which threatens more trouble to Europe
than the hdsts of Genghis Khan or Attila.
It may still be possible for a British officer
to “clash with his fiery few” and rout a
horde of blacks. One yellow race, however,
can meet the whites on equal terms on land
and sea, and win. The loss of that monopoly
of the arts and ability which enabled Europe
to defeat and control vastly greater bodies of
colored men has added a new significance to
sheer weight of numbers.
The whites, already in a huge minority,
increase more slowly than the others. While
the blacks double their numbers in 40 years,
and the yellow and brown races in 60 years,
the whites take about 80 years. European
control of inferior races removed some of the
positive checks to their increase and helped
them to multiply more rapidly than ever.
Although the United States has her own
internal trouble, caused by the presence of
an indigestible black mass in her lower
regions, and Africa is a large collection of
race problems, there is no immediate danger
of the negroes threatening white supremacy.
The peril which overshadows all others is
Yellow. The higher rate of increase of
yellow and brown races as compared vyith
white has to be considered along with a pro-
cess of education which is lifting a weighty
proportion of them up to Western standards
of military and industrial efficiency.
W
With 300 millions of colored subjects in
Asia the British have a tough time before
them. In India the hatred of the masterful
white has always been productive of unrest.
The intelligent Hindoos who have read Mill
and Morley on liberty are likely to stir the
orowd beneath with increasing violence as
they find insufficient scope for their abilities
in British service, and see themselves ex-
cluded from other parts of the Empire. The
victory of Japan, and to some extent the
revolt in Turkey, have awakened hopes that
the whites may be so crippled in Asia that a
yellow and brown combination will be able
to enforce a retaliatory policy of exclusion
and keep Asia for the Asiatics.
Putnam Weale is very confident that the
era of vast migrations is over, and that the
leading nations are virtually settled within
their natural boundaries. Those areas in
which a forcible displacement has taken
place, such as the Balkan States, will be
centres of disturbance until the final adjust-
ments are made. The great conflict, how-
ever, will be between Europe and Asia, and
the convincing ground will be the Pacific.
The issue is complicated by Britain’s alli-
ance with Japan. It is now being recognised
in Britain that Lansdowne’s treaty, which
expires in 1915, was a short-sighted measure.
Weale is emphatic on that point.
Racially, the treaty is a very bad one. inas-
nuch as it puts England in a must unfavorable
ight, not only in Europe, America and Australia,
but n Asia as well. For she not only endorses in
this instrument the robbery of Korea, but she
confesses to 1500 million Asiatic subjects that she
cannot protect them from European aggression,
save with the help of an Asiatic ally.
When it is no longer useful to Japan the
alliance will be dropped, and in the mean-
time, with an eye to ulterior objects, she is
cementing an alliance with Austria for offen-
sive purposes against, Russia.
\l>
Japan, according to Weale, fears Russia
more than any other Power, and is anxious
to preserve peace while she recovers from
war, extends her railways in Manchuria and
tightens her hold on China. Unless some
Napoleonic genius arises in £hina —or Europe
intervenes—her teeming millions are likely
to fall under Japanese control. Japan’s
sorest need is population. At the present
rate of progress, 1925 will see Japan with 63
millions, while Russia will have 200 millions
and China 475 millions.
The one white Power which during the first
term of the present century will act as the greatest
restraint on Japan, will not be England, the
friend, or even Russia, the old enemy—it will be
the United States. The completion of the
Panama Canal is destined to have the most far-
reaching results on the future progress of the
world and especially on the progress of the
Pacific; but the actual rdle which the United
States shall play in the development of Eastern
Asia must for a long inter>’al remain totally unde-
cided. . . . The fact that the United States repre-
sents in the popular mind the supreme expression
of a triumphant democracy—a free State totally
detached from all European rivalries—is every-
where a very great factor in the movements of
world-politics, but nowhere more so than in the
politics of Eastern Asia.
Weale considers that Japan will have to
declare her hand with regard to China before
,1923, when the lease of Port Arthur ex-
pires, and if then China is forced to make
common cause with Japan, the supremacy
of Yellow in the East is certain :
The goal of “ China stronger than Japan ”
should be kept in sight; expediency demands
that the goal be now approached. For, if it is
not, the writer ventures to prophesy that in less
than two decades America will cease to own the
Philippines and Japan will obtain the acknow-
ledged hegemony of the yellow world.
W
Generally speaking, Weale thinks that
Britain’s policy is to combine with Russia to
settle the respective spheres of influence in
Asia; allow India to spread over adjacent
lands, and encourage Indians to build up a
self-governing State within the Empire.
With a cheerful leap over obvious difficul-
ties, he says that, as the British wardenship
of the Pacific is likely to be transferred to
the people of the three great Commonwealths
—Canada, Australia and Maoriland—
Let us boldly ask, would not the flying of an
Indian naval flag in the Persian Gulf, in the
Arabian Sea, in the Red Sea, and even in the
Mediterranean, not only animate the breasts of
Indian patriots but convince all Europe and Asia
that a new giant was growing up—a giant no
longer the helot of England, but England’s real
ally ?.. .
It is responsibility, and the menace which
always underlies responsibility, which is the sole
connecting linK between partners in national
affairs, as it is between partners in private affairs.
Canada, Australia, S. Africa, India, Maoriland—
eahh has a definite rdle to pltfy. Where the
waters impose a restraint, powerful local fleets
to ride the waters become necessities—not coast-
guard fleets, but deep-sea fleets, and where land
meets land, there must forces be prepared to
march. That this devolution, the first principle
in world politics, has been long perceived is a
commonplace ; but the admission has only been
made in a tentative and hesitating manner, and
seems to be qualified with that inherent British
distrust of everything that has not been sanctified
by centuries of custom.
To Australians, a handful of whites holding
a large territory dangerously near to the
brown and yellow world, and having a notice
posted on the front gate, “None but whites
admitted,” the importance of such an able
statement of color problems and such far-
sighted views as those of Putnam Weale in
The Conflict of Color need not be emphasised.
The Higher Criticism
Abdullah the Addite had travelled far.
All day, under the burning sun, he drove
his swaying camels across the desert, medi-
tating on the glory of God, and at set of sun
came upon a deserted caravanserai. Rest
was grateful to man and beast. His camels
knelt as if in prayer. Abdullah lit a fire of
camel dung, filled his gourd at a well, and
opened his bag of dates. Refreshed and
wrapped in his haik, he listened to the
rustle of the breeze in the palm trees, peace
in his heart.
Abdullah, though but a poor camel driver,
was a lover of poetry. He especially de-
lighted in the camel poets of his native
country; but his taste was sufficiently
catholic to embrace the romantic Syrian
school. So he carried with him a copy of
the “ Canticle of Canticles,” a dramatic*love
poem by a young author named Solomon,
which had just been issued from the Jerusa-
lem press. These verses, though they did
not deal directly with gourds and camels,
stirred his imagination. He found them
full of local color, and unaffected in their
sensuous simplicity. He read on as the
camels snored and the stars glittered.
How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse !
How much better is thy love than wine ! And
the smell of thine ointments than all spices !
Abdullah put down the book and prepared
for sleep. As he arranged his few things, he
noticed in the caravanserai a pile of papers
left there by previous travellers. He gath-
ered them together, and looked through
their valuable columns for news of the great
world, the divorce of a sheik’s third wife,
some clever theft of almonds or goats’ milk,
a murder, maybe, of a money-changer, with
a picture of the spot where the body was
found.
He picked up the Nazareth Booklover.
and, behold, there was an account of lii.s
favorite poem by the renowned Arabian
Socialist, H. H. C n. He read eagefly
as follows :
Very attractive is the Canticle of Canticles, by
Mr. Solomon, who is well known to our readers as
the nephew of the financier. Sir Isaac Abrahams.
Mr. Solomon’s work has already attracted the
notice of the more discriminating readers of
England and America as that of a young man who
should make his mark in the near future. If
readers take the advice of this paper they will
hasten to buy a copy. The book is selling well
in England, and should also sell well in Jeru-
salem. I cannot recommend the verses beginning,
“O comfort me with flagons.” When I read that
passage I put down the book hastily. But other-
wise Mr. Solomon’s muse, if it has not yet the
passionate intensity of Mrs. Forrest’s, cannot fail
to delight. Mr. Solomon has promise of much
better work in the future. Our copy has reached
us through the courtesy of Messrs. Judah, v'auaan
and Co. |
Abdullah turned for consolation to the
Jerusalem Argus , which was noted through-
out Palestine for its literary style. Under
the heading “ Holiday Verse ” lie read the
following by the Sanscrit Lecturer, W.
M h :
Of the making of books there is no end ; for
even in the vacation, when a poor hack requires
rest, comes this Hebrew compilation of verse
and prose. I wish the volume were smaller in
size to fit more easily into the pocket of one bent
on rambling in the Hebron hills. Fortunately,
in Mr. Solomon’s verso, there is no mention of
cedars, or ivory, or alabaster, or myrrh or spike-
nard ; he does not write of chariots, or vine-
yards in search of that local color we are
accumstomed to find too often in minor
Syrian verse. For this relief,, much thanks.
The Higher Criticism has informed us that the
poem is erotic, and not an allegorical treatise on
marriage. The latter interpretation has now be-
come the last refuge of the intellectually destitute.
Though in the poem there is much that we would
willingly let die, there ate many passages of real
beauty ; and among the clouds of my meditative
narghile arises the form of a woman slumbrous
with Oriental magnificence that could have been
created only by a true spring poet. “ Gold in the
Gutter,” Garvice’s unique masterpiece, in popular
estimation will be regarded, as literature, as
superior to Mr. Solomon’s Canticle. Bis aliter
visum. It seems otherwise to sound critics.
In the Samaria Sun Abdullah came on an
article entitled “Poetry and Common-sense,”
by the popular alienist A. G. S—s.
Genius is a mental disease. The poet is an in-
valid ; but men of enormous physical strength
make the best poets. Arabian poetry is mostly
doggerel, due to a milk diet and Labor legislation.
Grant Hervey is their greatest verse-smith, though
in national feeling and in word-music he has often
been excelled. O’Dowd’s reputation is based on
Hebrew tradition. His ballad-metre is not origi-
nal, but was shaped seons si nee in the brain of
some forgotten Negro poet of the Gold Coast. Sic
transit. If Roderic Quinn had have been born in
Yorkshire and eaten-more bacon in early youth, his
digestion might have been impaired, but he would
have written hotter, more vital poetry. Poetry is
Science plus Art, but an Artthat reasons and calcu-
lates, a science thatdreamsand sings. Theflowerof
Paganism can never grow on Syrian soul. Palestine.
is a No-License country, peopled by Irish Jews.
Hence it follows their trains are the fastest in the
world, but their novels are ridiculous. Solomon's
experiment was doomed to failure. He has written
much better stuff than this imitative Canticle,
which has not been sufficiently fused in conscious-
ness. We can understand how it came to be
written, in the stress of amorous excitement; but we
fail to understand how it came to be printed.' We
used to think publishers were men of business?
Abdullah was bewildered. He would read
no more higher criticism ; so with confidence
he took up the Gomorrah Herald , a home
journal devoted to divorce, chariot racing,
and unseemly conduct in the bazaars. Alas !
Among petty crimes his eye detected,
“Assyrian Verse, Reviewed by A. T.
St g.” Almost against his will he read :
The Canticle op Canticles.
By A. Solomon
(Aarons and Cohen, Jerusalem^.
In his fascinating essay on the “Metaphysical
Basis of Dramatic Art,” Professor Bradley in-
forms us that no play that possesses literary
merit can ever succeed on the stage. The merit
of Mr. Solomon’s play is more dramatic than
literary. The plot, of course, is taken fqpm the
novel of Moses, the Chaldean author whose works
are not as popular in this country as they deserve
to be. Mr. Solomon’s style is far from impecca-
ble, and his blank verse reads not infrequently like
broken up prose. Yet he has unmistakable
strength, and his reminiscences of the classical
authors are very delightful to the cultured reader.
One of the finest passages in the play is that be-
ginning :
“Thy hair is as flocks of goats which come up
from Mount Gilead,
Thy teeth as flocks of sheep that are shorn,”
which, in its lyrical charm, is almost worthy of
the master, Swinburne. It is a pity Mr, Solomon
does not write more often in this strain, instead
of descending to such loose stuff at the following:
“ Who is she that cometh forth as the morning
rising,
Fair as the moon, bright as the sun,
Terrible as an army set in array ? ”
where the mixed metaphors tend to irritate
rather than delight the reader. Sometimes his lan-
guage is neither Babylonian, Hebrew, or good
Chinese. It is obvious that Mr. Solomon has not
yet found his full expression ; nevertheless, this
pleasing little volume marks a decided advance on
his previous achievements.
hen he had finished, the poor camel drive
pondered deeply. He smiled in his blac
beard, and said to himself that he alway
knew Solomon w.as inferior in power to th
camel poets.
‘ lll I J°y he took up his favorite paper
the Bethlehem Bulletin. What was written
therein he regarded as the true <mspel. He
opened the Red Page ” and read a review
by one B S——s, headed succinctly :
Solomon.
Aarons aqd Cohen have added to their popula
half-dollar senes of Poetry without Tears
Syrian Love Song, by Solomon. It is the kind o
thing that has been done hundreds of times before
but it still seems to find readers, and it may
amuse sentimental nursemaids on Sunday. Thi
writer drifts into various metres (not always sue
cessful), but in isolated spots his picturesque die
tion is very fine, borne of the verses are so gooc
that one wishes Solomon would give up pawn
broking and. take his art more seriously. But in
a book of this kind the binding is the chief con
Sideration, and Aarons and Cohen can be com
mended for good work in this department. There
are two misprints on page 27, and a comma
has been inverted in the middle of the sixth line
on page 48. This is the result of printing a Syrian
book in Jerusalem. The best peem in the book
“Comfort Me with Flagons,’’ originally appearec
on this page, but that fact has not been acknow
leged.
He felt better now, and, sitting under a
palm-tree, read by starlight some stories in
the great native magazine, The Dead Sea
Lone Hand. He had forgotten all about
Solomon when near the # end of the magazine
he read the fatal heading, •
“Solomon in All His Glory.”
Under this came an article by the author of
“ Jerusalem Side Streets,” the ultra
modernist, A. H. A-
Modern literature demands something more of
its votaries than mere blind adoration and servile
imitation of romantic conventions. The “Canticle
of Canticles ” lacks the essential significance of
modernity. The universe comprises fish-balls and
pilau as well as locusts and wild honey, turquoise
earrings as well as Babylonian anklets. There is
poetry in a Jerusalem policeman, as that great
aytist, George Lambert, has shown us. Solomon
has scarcely done more than sing of love ip its
somewhat narrow Eastern environment. He has
nothing of the bold scientific outlook of H. Gj
Wells, Galsworthy or G.B.S.', nor can he give us
the modern prattle of Baby’s tongue or the
waving of his pink tootsies ; yet to one who has
visited the metropolis and has heard the clamor
of modern streets so appealing in its enchant-
ment, those modest verses have an exotic rusticity
not entirely devoid of charm.. . . F. 6.
Abdullah picked up the Damascus Worker
and read the report of the Camel Drivers’
Union. He remembered this journal also
endeavored to uplift the masses by bringing
the people closer to art and art closer to the
people. He turned the leaves, and arrived
at
Page 21. Conducted by N L . We
have received a copy of the “Canticle of Can-
ticles,” by A. Solomon. Space prevents us from
quoting more than three columns and a half.
“ The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth ; for
thy love is better than wine.
Because of the savor of thy good ointments, etc.”
We hope to be able to give another 2000 lines in
our next issue.
The last paper Abdullah found was the
Galilee Socialist. In the centre of the paper,
printed in double columns, was an article on
“Thunder Poetry,” by the Rationalist,
Unitarian, Catholic Mystic, B. O’D. Ab-
dullah pulled himself together and read :
A poet is a psychical cataclysm. In aeons past
the prognathous neanderthal hymned the peptones
of auethonous canticles in Neo-Hellenic strains
which have not yec died away. Now a poet is a
hormone. He is cryptic, nympholeptic, thauma-
turgisd and cabalistic. Thus in the dust-bins of
the Mammon-ordered Past lie many an abandoned
jam-tin decorated with pre-Raphaelian frescoes of
starry beauty, doomed to be forgotten owing to
the lack of jammy matter. (Botticelli and Lister-
Lister I do not include, as I consider both these
artists in their color symphonies, beautiful as
such, wanting in the warm tinge of verisimilitude.)
Despite his technical imperfections on the blue
waves of Solomon’s poetry here and there arise
many a palm-island, gorgeous with parrots, and
colored by the presence of tawny Australian
lubras; and in their potentialities of infinite
suggestion they cannot, but make for that millen-
nium Eden when no more the sanguinary feet of
Moloch will trample the super-children of this
Holy Land. But no critic except Mr. Murdock,
Mr. Strong, and Mr. A. G. Stephens is eompe-
petent to express an opinion on Mr. Solomon’s
work, which for its full understanding requires a
knowledge of geography, anarchy, French sym-
bolism, German metaphysics, Christian Science
and Fiji statistics. Soiomon, you belong to the
Push Poetical of Palestine. “ Comfort me with
apples,’’ not the apples bought in the bazaars, not
the fabled Golden Apples of the Hesperides—
these also v but more than these—the Apples of
the Astral Plane, whose atavistic virtues will
extrude the theosophic fruit of Sodom which has
hobble-skirted our legislators, alas ! for so many
centuries.
“Lo!” exclaimed Abdullah the Addite,
“ I have sinned.”
He took The Canticle of Canticles, put it
carefully into his camel-dung fire, wrapped
his haik around him, and slept the sleep of
the just.

A Clergyman’s Testimony to Clements Tonic .
REV. J. WILLIAMS.
A MINISTERING MEDICINE.
FOR ELEVEN YEARS PASTOR
of the Wooloongabba Congregational Church, Bris-
bane, and Principal of the Theological School
founded therewith, the Rev. John Williams, a strong
intellectual thinker, and a fine and forceful preacher,
well remembered in Brisbane lor his splendid edu-
cational sermons and lectures, writes the following
letter to the merits of a great medicine which is
creating unquestionable cures of Nervous Breakdown,
Insomnia, Weakness, Brain-Fag, and Stomach and
Liver Ailments. Business men and women in ill-
health should read this letter, especially if they wish
to regain health and strength, and enjoy life as only
healthy people can
“Clements Tonic Cured Me.”
“CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“ Prompted by a spirit of gratitude, I write to let you know that Clements
Tonic did for me what I have learnt it has done so effectively for others. I
suffered from nervous breakdown, consequent upon the strain of over-work,
and was for a time at quite a loss to find an effective recuperative. Happily
my choice fell on Clements Tonic, which restored me to my wonted self with
surprising speed and surety. When I have felt the same condition of nerves
arising, I have promptly checked it by a timely use of the remedy. Above
all, I find it induces a natural, refreshing sleep, wherein Nature has oppor-
tunity to work her cures in her own way ; and what could be better said of
a remedy than that ? I am, yours faithfully,
REV. J. WILLIAMS.”
Every week letters in praise of the health-creating properties of this great medicine, Clements Tonic,
tn the proprietors. They come from all States of the Commonwealth. Those persons whoare
iivmairerl digestion, nervous breakdown, or debility, constipation, weakness, lassitude, jow
snirits. biliousness, sick headache, liver or kidney irregularity, should obtain Clements Tonic and health
a t the same time. This letter proves this can be done. People who are ill, sickly, weak-nerved; with
strength, vigor, energy undermined,'or who cannot get strong alter long or sudden illnesses or attacks
nf fever.’etc., should read the tributes to this great medicine,-and send for it without delay. A 1
Chemists and Stores sell it everywhere in Australia, so that tl sick person may obtain it^

*Even with all the salubriousness of this, splendid
Australian climate, your women are not
developed in figure as well as they should be. ”
—A prominent French writer at a farewell dinner.
PERFECT BUST
DEVELOPMENT.
IT is the refreshing firmness and delightful
fulness of the feminine form that capti-
vates, and the woman who is most per-
fectly developed is the one who monopolises
the endearments of the opposite sex.
•- A thin woman is not necessarily plain ; in
fact many thin women are admittedly pretty,
but. the admission is always qualified with —
“but, poor thing, she is so terribly thin.”
If your bust lacks development and firm-
ness, and your arms, neck and shoulders are
thin and scrawny, even though your face is
pretty, you invariably take second place to
your more fully-developed, full-bosomed
associates in your own social set. It will
always be so unless you correct the imperfec-
tions in your figure.
By following our advice, thousands of weak,
nervous, run-down, anaemic women, who
came to us suffering the ravages of constipa-
tion, biliousness, backache from internal and
functional disorders, and merely skeletons of
what they were to become, have not only been
restored to perfect health, but have been
brought up to their normal weight and devel-
oped to their correct bust, hip and limb pro-
portions.
Let us tell you, absolutely free of charge, how the
same may be done for you. All we ask is that you
enclose a 2d. stamp, and write for our specially-
illustrated free book, “ Lovely Woman.” We will
also send a Free Sample Treatment.
Full particulars will be posted to you at once.
Our advice costs you nothing. Call if possible.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Gallop of Fire.
When the north wind moans through the blind
creek courses.
And revels with harsh, hot sand,
I loose the horses, the wild, red horses,
I loose the horses, the mad, red horses,
And terror is on the land.
With prophetic murmur the hills are humming,
The forest kings bend and blow ;
With hoofs of brass on the baked earth drum-
ming—
Oh ! brave red horses, they hear us coming,
And the legions of Death lean low.
O’er the wooded height, through the sandy hollow
Where the boles to the axe have rung,
Though they fly the foeman as flies the swallow—
The fierce red horses, my horse 3 follow
With flanks to the faint earth flung.
Or with frenzied hieroglyphs, fear embossing
Night’s sable horizon bars,
Through tangled mazes of death-darts crossing
I swing my leaders, and watch them tossing
Their red manes against the stars.
But when south winds sob in the drowned creek'
courses .
And whisper to hard, wet sand,
I hold the horses, the spent red horses,
I hold the horses, the tired red horses,
And silence is on the land.
For the south wind sobs ’rnong the drowned creek
courses
For sorrows no man shall bind—
Ah God ! for the horses, the black plumed horses,
Dear God ! for the horses, Death’s own pale
horses,
That raced in the tracks behind.
Victoria.
MARIE E. J. PITT.
Fallen Shrines.
I wonder if, in old Imperial Rome,
Catchpenny jacks-in-office made a gate
To trade on ancient relics carried home
By patriotic wardens of the State,
And charged denarii, that the plebs might pay
To gape at symbols of some earlier day.
Or has the remnant-nation sunk so low
That it should reap scant harvest of its dead,
And make its forum and its kings a show,
And charge admission to the Caesars’ bed ;
Gleaning small profits from its hero’s name—
But then Imperial Britain does the same.
Rather than this, the tombs were shut beneath ;
The crumbled palace walls to earth returned ;
The fallen columns find a grassy sheath ;
And altars, where the fires of worship burned,
Be not again from moss and wreckage torn,
But pass, the human garments long outworn.
Better, than clean away the ancient weeds
That ruined temples show their fretted bones,
To rot in stately ruin of its creeds,
Which perish ere the rains deface the stones —
As old St. Peter’s, once the phoenix-pile,
Now dozes in senility awhile.
ROME.
C. G. A. COLLES.
Drinks.
I do not care what drinks I drink
When liquor like a god’s gift flows ;
I love the merry glasses’ clink
And comrades gay ; and Heaven knows
It might be tea or ginger fizz—
But still I think it seldom is.
’Tis not the drink that is the thing—
Else why not share it with the flies ?
But merry spirits lend a wing
On which our friendly feelings rise
In manner that makes revelry ;
I don’t know how it works with tea.
Tea I have drunk ; but never felt
The joy that to some drink belongs.
It never yet made heart to melt
In music, laughter, love and songs ;
It never made me sing a bar
And think myself a rising star.
It never seemed to drown my cares,
Nor painted things in rosy hue;
It never made me fall down stairs
And gaily fancy that I flew,
And try to climb the stairs—in vain—
To see if I coul’d fly again.
It never made me burst with mirth
At rather light but empty chat,
The while I wondered what on earth
The joke was I was laughing at;
It never pictured as a joke
The fact that I was stony broke.
It never made me grasp a hand
And swear, by all the gods above,
Of all the people in the land
I bore its owner greatest love,
And beg him name what it should be ;
It never made him shout for me.
If it would do these things for me,
My life would with such gambols chime.
I’d rest contentedly with tea,
And take a dozen pots a time,
And e’er the dozenth pot I’d pour
I’d order up a dozen more.

THE DEFENCE THAT IS NOT TAKEN
SERIOUSLY.
Australia, with its army of 120,000 kids and never
a grown man among them, and with its insane
idea that a naval base is not a thing to be fixed
according.to the best interests of the country, but
a cash prize to.be grabbed for by every squalling
local politician, doesn't take its defence seriously
as yet. It is still living in a fool’s paradise and
obsessed by “Rule Britannia.” So it is not won-
derful that N.S.W. State Premier McGowen
should have risen last week to bleat the old, silly
obvious falsehood about Sydney as the only pos-
sible naval headquarters for the Commonwealth.
He didn’t say why it was the only possible spot
for that purpose; he just alleged that it was. In
this joyous and complete readiness to let the
safety—perhaps even the existence —of Australia
go to the dogs or the Devil so long ash.s own
State gets any little,profit that is going, the aver-
age parish-pump politician of N.S.W. isn’t very
widely different from his neighbors. Yet he is
different. Each one of his contemporaries is also
quite convinced, with or without evidence, of the
special fitness of hiss own State to house Aus-
tralia’s gang of -marine architecture. But the
N.S.W. politician strikes a lower depth than any
by demanding that the crowded and utterly
unfit commercial port of Sydney shall be
"the location of the Australian squadron. He
knows perfectly well, unless he is a complete
madman, that a naval force which is to be taken
in dead earnest must have a home of its own. It
must not betangled up with merchant shipping,
horse-punts, ferry boats and sundries. It must
not be adjacent to a great cosmopolitan popula-
tion, where every tenth man may be a foreign spy
or agent. It must have its location in a harbor
which it can shut against all comers when
necessary, for in war time the craft that
looks like a ferry boat or a coal ship or
a patient old tramp loaded with vegetables is apt
to be a hostile torpedo boat, and the fleet which
lies iu a place where hundreds of strange vessels
are coining and going gets blown up at its moor-
ings almost to a certainty. And if the fleet, after
an unlucky battle, regains its harbor in a crippled
condition, there ought not to be a great, rich, ter-
rified city alongside of it—a city which is liable to
destruction unless the ships buy immunity for it
by prompt surrender. These facts are so well
known that every country on this earth which
owns any warships worth mentioning keeps its
naval and commercial harbors separate, and unless
it is claimed that Britain, France, Germany, Aus-
tria, Italy, the United States, etc., know nothing,
and never have known anything, about sea war-
fare. those who clamor for Sydney as Australia’s
chief naval centre are either fools or unpatriotic
scoundrels.
* * * *
In this matter, as already mentioned, N.S.W.
occupies a slightly different position from theother
States. E ich local Premier wants his State to pos-
sess the naval base whether its position is suitable
or not. But only the N.S.W. politician carries so
far the policy of dragging everything to the capital
city that he wants to haul the fleet there also, even
though he knows that by so doing he would hope-
lessly cripple its powers for defence. Any other
State which has mixed in this sordid dispute has
been willing to give the Federal authority some
suitable deep-water inlet—a place practically free
from population, and one which could be reserved
for naval purposes only. The N.S.W. person
demands that the fleet should dwell at his door,
but offers no place to put it. His idea is that it
should be a precarious lodger on certain liquid
premises that are owned and controlled by the
State authorities. As in the matter of the
Federal capital, the only thing that is more
violent than his clamor about his “rights”
is the meanness of his offers. If Admiral
Henderson, who is now understood to be
sitting patiently on the egg of a report re this
subject, should ultimately recommend Port Jack-
son, the only possible explanation will be that he
judges the future of the Australian fleet by the
past, and looks upon it as a sort of silly joke which
can pursue the useless tenor of its way as well in
one place as another.
* * * * ,
It is fairly plain (this remark has been made
already) that Australia hasn’t yet begun to take
its defence seriously. Its army of 120,000 infants
is one evidence, and the wretched tendency to
regard the fleet partly as a harbor ornament,
partly as a holiday picnic show, and partly as
something to sell beer 'and vegetables to, is an-
other. Behind everything there is, apparently,
the old conviction that Britain is always mis-
tress of the sea in any case, and that the
Australian fleet will never be really wanted.
Among the tragedies of nations is the fact that
hardly anybody reads history, barring those silly
little school volumes which are produced in each
country for thiit country’s special glorification,
and which consist mostly of lies, omissions and
evasions. Therefore few people take the trouble
to consider (1) how very often Britain hasn’t
ruled the seas; (2) how very precarious its rule
has often been when it did nominally achieve that
feat; and (3) the great lack of evidence as to
whether it rules the seas to-day. There was a
burst of marine glory about the time of Edward
111., who was practically the first sovereign that
made J. Bull a success on the waters ; but after
that period England had very little luck on the
salt, unstable element for 200 years, and much of
the time it could hardly protect its own coasts
from outrage. It took the command of the waters
from the Spaniards in Elizabeth's day (the French
Government, being friendly, didn’t argue the
point); and promptly lost it again under her two
successors. Then Holland had a turn. Cromwell
again made England supreme by his wars with
the Dutch, but in the very next reign the trident
had passed so decisively back to the Hollanders
that their squadrons even blockaded London.
After that followed 23 years of trouble and French
domination. This sort of thing didn’t really
matter very much to the self-contained England
of that day, though to the England of the 20th
century, dependent on foreign imports for its daily
and hourly bread, such battles as Sole Bay. and
Beachy Head would look like appalling disasters.
The very uncertain marine sceptre was recovered
for a moment at La Hogue in 1692, but only after
years of iil-fortune, during which the Dutch fleet'
carried invading armies to England and the
French fleet carried invading armies to Ireland,
and Admiral Tarry-in-Town did not prevail
against them. After 1692 the kingdom of the sea be-
came once more a matter of dispute and remained
so for nearly a century. There Were victories
and defeats and drawn battles. The United
States were lost because the French chanced to be
bossing the ocean for a moment and it happened
to be a moment of crisis. Minorca was lost for
the same reason. The risk of invasion Wits: Sel-
dom far away; but the England of that time
couldn’t be starved out by any blockade, because
it grew its own food ; also, it reckoned that it
could raise as big an army as the next country,
and so it took little stock of invasions. The coun-
try hadn’t all its eggs in one basket in good King
George’s glorious days, and its people slept
quite soundly, even when a hostile fleet was in
sight, and no one knew for certain what the
morrow might bring forth.
* * * *
Then came the streak of luck which happens
once in 1000 years or so. The French Revolution
broke out. The French navy was officered, in the
upper grades, almost wholly bv aristocrats, and
the revolutionists sacked some and guillotined
others, while most of the balance saved theirnecks
by flight. France was invaded by a horde, of
enemies, and with its foes almost in sight of
Paris it wanted soldiers much more than it did
sailors. Also, it badly wanted money. It
found some soldiers by sending its crews ashore
to do land duty, and it saved some money
by laying up the splendid fleet of Louis XVI.
and letting it rot in harbor. When the republic
resumed sea enterprise its marine officers were
mostly soldiers who knew no navigation and mer-
chant skippers who hardly knew how to fire a
gun, and its crews were a sort of amphibious
militia—neither one thing nor another, and not
much of either. The British captains—though
their ships were largely manned by pressed men,
quota men, “ state-the-case” men, boys and muti-
neers—made hash of this starved and mongrel
force and its bottomless vessels, and Britain, for
the first time, got undisputed command of the sea.
There was no Power in all the world that had
even the semblance of a show against it. This
is really quite a recent event. And Britain is
supposed to have command of the sea to-
day, because the issue has never been
put to the test since Nelson’s time.
That is to say, Britain rules the waves now
just as Prussia ruled the land the day before the
unspeakable downfall at Jena. Britain has a
navy which was invincible in Nelson s time, about
100 years ago. Prussia, the day or hour or half-
hour or half-minute before it bumped against
Napoleon, had an army which had been the best
on earth in Frederick's time, 40 years before.
But when next Britain has to fight in real earnest
at sea, it will do so at a disadvantage yyliM) it
never experienced before and froui^\vln^4 ; its
opponents will be free, for its almosYjentire'de-
pendence on foreign food supplies and tlje
sity for protecting the influx of its daily bread
tend to destroy the mobility of i,ts squadrons and
tie them to the shore in,quite a new fashion.-,
**. . ♦ *
Britain has glorious traditions on the sea,-but
that only means, after all, that it has been longer
on top in marine affairs than any one of its
European competitors save, perhaps, Denmark,
Venice, Home and Greece, and that it has
been longer on top than any one of its
modern rivals. Just because the British
marine supremacy, with all its grandeur,
has been a rather precarious thing in' most of the
past and will likely, be a precarious thing many
times in the future, it is Australia’s business to
take its defences seriously. It isn’t taking land
defence seriously with its army of kids. And it
makes a mockery of its sea defence when squalid
little State politicians are prepared to sacrifice all
the essentials of efficiency, that their vanity may
be gratified by the sight of the country’s fighting
ships anchored opposite their own front verandahs,
and that their own constituents may make a
profit by selling beer ,to the seamen.
Where people really understand the meaning of
war no big city wants the naval headquarters at
its door so that it may be the first object of the
enemy’s attack. Such a craving is only possible
in a land which has been accustomed to form two
soldiers into a hollow square and solemnly review
them for an Easter holiday, and which is habitu-
ated to consider an ironclad as a handy flagship at
the regatta. It is a humorous situation, yet it is
liable to be costly. In d.efenoe matters a mistake
is seldom found out till the time for repairing it is
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Policy of Half Measures.
Thk by-election at Batinau (Vie.), to fill the place
of Beard, M. H.R., deceased, resulted in a win for
the Labor party by a majority of 2453. It was a
very substantial figure—but less than a year ago
the Labor majority was 5804. Part of the trouble
doubtless arose out of the fact that a by-election
is a purely local business and arouses no national
excitement; but that didn’t account for every-
thing— not by a long way. As compared with last
April, the Labor vote diminished by 4184, and
the lion-Labor vote by 833. It is not
a good showing. The Batman constituency
stands, above all things, for Labor and Protection,
and the slackness of the Fisher Government
in the matter of the tariff begins to complicate
affairs badly. Its position is that it won’t touch
the question of duties until it gets control of in-
dustrial legislation and can establish a system
whereby the benefits of the tariff are to be fairly
divided between the manufacturer and his em-
ployees. If the Referendum goes against it, and
it doesn’t get control of industrial legislation, the
inference is that it will leave the duties entirely
alone. But while it i$ waiting to see if the
grass proposes to grow at some future date, the
present and immediate horse is starving. The
boot industry, which is a great standby in the
Batman electorate, lias struck an especially
notable snag. Though the New Protection hasn’t
arrived yet, wages have been pushed up by the
action of State Wages Boards —not pushed up very
high, certainly, yet so much higher than they are
in many competing countries that the scanty
tariff has become quite useless to keep out im-
ports. The importer, in fact, has the ad vantage,
and the high—or moderately high—wage of the
Victorian bootmaker has become, in many
cases, no wage at all. The promise of the
Labor Government is that, if it acquires
power to ensure that the worker shall get a fa r ir
proportion of the benefits of Protection, then it
will look into the tariff and repair it where neces-
sity. Unfortunately, there are cases in which
the worker already gets too much of the benefits of
Protection; or, to be more accurate, lie doesn't
get .too much, but there is so little Protection that
what he gets is a great deal more than the indus-
try can afford. In such a case the manufacturer
has at least the chance of sacking his workmen
and turning importer, so he isn’t the worst
loser.; but the workman, as a rule, has no
chance at all. He is sold by his friends,
who offer him the Bead Sea fruit of a fair
paper wage, while their joyous readiness to
admit on easy terms the goods of the foreign
sweater and non-unionist often, leaves him with
neither wage nor job. The manufactures of Aus-
tralia are increasing on the whole, but (1) they
are not increasing so fast as,they should do con-
sidering the increase of population ; (2) they are
not increasing so fast as the imports; and (3)
some of the higher class of manufactures, and
those which are especially exposed to foreign
competition, are really on the down grade. Aus-
tralia dodders around charging 5 or 10 or 25 per
cent. Protective duties, and yet expects its manu-
facturers to pay, in many cases, 100 per cent,
higher wages than their British or other rivals.
Japan, which is at least suspected of the
merit of being thorough, has just decided
that when its convention with Britain expires
it will raise its already lofty duties so that they
will vary, on most articles of importance, from 100
to 620 per cent. Yet Japan is a low wage and
long hours country. What chance Australia has
against such methods as these, while the Govern-
ment of Half-Measures is in power,' can be im-
agined. And it is probably owing to weariness
of half-measures that the Labor majority, in one
of the most democratic and Protectionist con-
stituencies of Australia, has sagged down within
a year from 5804 to 2453.

The Tragic Folly of N.S.W.’s “ Democratic ”
Party.
The decision of the new-born “ Democrats ” in
the N.S. W. Assembly to range themselves on the
anti-Australian side of the Referenda fence is—to
consider it from the lowest standpoint—a ghastly
instance of a tine opportunity lost. Never has any
Australian State looked with a chillier eve on its
two chief parties than N.S. W. does to-day. The
average “Liberal ”is sick of “Liberalism,” and
distrustful of his leaders; while the attitude of a
large section of local Laborites towards State
Labor was well expressed by an interjector who,
at the P.L. conference last week, remarked to
one of McGowen’s Ministers: “We trust the
Federal Labor men ; but we don’t trust
you.” The main trouble with both Parlia-
mentary parties is that, in one important
essential, many of the rank and file and most of
the leaders are ancient political war-horses who
are about a decade behind the ’bus of Public
Opinion. So far as any conception of the mean-
ing of Australian as opposed to State patriotism
is concerned, the McGowens, the Holmans and
Uie Daceys, the Wadics, the Woods and the
Onslows, stand on the precise spot occupied by
the Cabbage Iree mob” before Federation,
lhej adhere to the evil old traditions which -l
generation or more ago, made the Waler look
with loathing on the Victorian. W A DE-ite and
McGowEN-ite alike are agreed that it is pre-
ferable for the Commonwealth to be afflicted
indefinitely with rotten industrial legislation
than that N.S.W. should be “lopped ” of any of
its “powers”; both are determined to seize for
the particular section of this continent which they
inhabit the Federal capital, the naval base and
every cither fragment of national spoil that may
be drifting round, regardless of liow Australia at
large is going to fare in the process. Divided on
most issues, in the matter of rabid provincialism
they are one. Now, this by no means represents
the,feeling of the State. Put briefly, the general
sentiment .is that the times are too perilous for
the bickerings of 10 and 20 years back,
■fhe Australian of tliis generation does not
take the old gags about “Victorian aggres-
sion” and "the Mother State’s wrongs”
seriously. He is in dead earnest, however, in
regard to the things that may occur to his coun-
try (not N.S.W., but the Commonwealth) after
1915; and he listens hard when defence measures
are talked. Among other things, he appreciates
that an Australia which is divided against itself,
on the State rights or any other ticket, is unlikely
to lire vail against the invasive foreigner, and that
a sweated or trust-ridden or thinly-populated Aus-
tralia must be badly handicapped when its hour of
trial comes. Which things make him inclined to
support the Referenda proposals, without so
much as considering whether the “dignity”
of his State officials is going to be dim-
inished thereby. The N.S.W. “Democrats,”
in following the lead of the Sydney morning
papers (organs which have not gauged the trend
of public thought correctly on any single big issue
in the past seven years) have neglected the one
factor which might have rendered their party a
political force. They could have eoine out boldly,
and heaped scorn on the cause which is advocated
by every reactionary in the community. By
going one better than certain Laborites are
inclined to, they might even have been justified of
their proud title. As things are, that title be-
comes a joke. They offer nothing to lure to their
standard the most disillusioned Laborite or the
most disaffected of Diberals. V herefore, in a
little while, they will pass gently out and be heard
of no more.
A Fiscal Ghost.
The Shabbiest old gbost that ever escaped out of
the madhouses of Christendom turned up last
week in the columns of Sydney Telegram. It
was disturbed in its sleep by Neddy Pulsfohd,
the Freetrade Senator whom N.S.W. threw out in
disgust last April. Pulsford headed his printed
spook “ Black Days for Protection,” and pro-
ceeded to tell the old, familiar yarn about the
great rush back to the doctrines of Oobdkn.
It is a well-known narrative, dating Heaven
only knows how many years back. Every
time George Reid came back from a visit to
Victoria or South Australia he used to he
staggered—completely staggered—at the amazing
growth of Freetrade opinion. So did Parkks
before him. Parkes in his lifetime saw France,
Germany, Denmark, the United States, Canada,
Argentina and many other countries throw Free-
trade into the ditch. Reid saw Japan begin to
boom under high Protection, lie.saw New South
Wales become pai’t of a new Commonwealth and
make about as much progress in 10 years
of Protection as, it had done formerly in a
century of alleged Freetrade. Tn his time
every Protectionist country showed itself so
satisfied with Protection that it went in for
more of it. No Protectionist country went
back to Freetrade, despite all the assurances
that they were all just about to do so. A strong
Protectionist party formed in Britain itself, and
a few luckless and backward countries like Turkey
and China, which are pledged by treaty to low
tariffism, all started to clamor for a revision of
the agreements which keep them in shackles. Yet
Parkes and Reid, and Pursford who is the
shadow of Reid, and all the other shadows, never
ceased to see the impending downfall of high
tariffism. Like the Jacobites, whose exiled king
was always going to return in triumph to-morrow,
they extracted hope from the slenderest materials,
and dragged the cat of consolation, by the
tail, out of the asli-barrel of despair. Puls-
ford, in his deliverance, of last week, talked
about an .alleged conference of Freetraders in
Canada, and aboutdemonstrations ” in various
European capitals. He declared that doddering
old Yves Guyot, now bordering on bis 70th year,
lias got’together a little knot of Foreign-traders in
Paris. And he dug up this joyful news also
It comes somewhat as a surprise to learp.-Uiat the revo-
lution in Portugal, which ended the monarchy tand estab-
lished a republic, was largely due to the consequences of
a restrictive tariff. Every member of the new Portuguese
Ministry is said to be a Freetrader. President Braga, of
the Portuguese Republic, says that “ Protection lias ruined
Portugal and made parasites of the Portuguese peasantry.”
Truly it, does corneas “ somewhat of a surprise.”
The Portuguese people could, presumably, have
got Freetrade, if they had wanted it, quite as
easily under a monarchy as under a republic.
There is no evidence that the new Ministry is
made up of Freetraders—even Pulsford only-
says it is “ said ” to be so composed. The alleged
noble and lofty remark of President Braga seems
to be known only to Pulsford. Moreover, quite
a lot of people imagined that the ruin of Portugal
dated rather from its disastrous old-time experi-
ments i'n Freetrade, regarding which the Encyclo-
pedia Britannica (Vol. XIX, page 549) says:—
On 27th December, 1703, he (King Pedro II.) signed
tile famous Methuen treaty, by' which Portuguese wines
were to be imported into England at a lower duty than
those from France and Germany in return for a similar
concession to English textile The immediate
result was that I’edro acknowledged the Archduke
Charles, and tiie ulterior that Englishmen drank port
instead of claret or hock during the last century, while
the Portuguese imported nearly everything they wanted
from England, and remained ivithout manufactures.
Portugal enjoyed till the horrors of this arrange-
ment for 131 years, and became a very poor sort
of place. It tried some more Freetrade in 1864,
and got no better. Of late, it lias bad a very
moderate tariff, and because the Customs yielded
so little the place was smitten with land tax, indus-
trial tax, income tax, inhabited house tax, dividend
tax, bank tax, servant tax, carriage tax, titles tax.
salt tax ; with excise on tobacco, ditto on food-stutfs
produced in the country ; tax on all goods brought
into Lisbon by land, and local rates. One result
of low duties and general muddle was that in
1908 (the last year for which figures are avail-
able) Portugal imported £15.198,995 worth of
goods and only exported goods to the value of
£6,765,347 to pay for them. That was the worst
of a long series of years in which the miserable
land of the senhors had pursued the importing
policy'. It was the limit and the dead finish.
Portugal was drained of its last copper to pay
for foreign goods. So it decided that something
was wrong, and revolushed us an experiment.


The fiscal result is nob yet known, but if Portugal
gets any more Freetrade, and starts to import
any more than it has been doing of late, Heaven
help it!
The Generalship of A. Fisher, Prime
Minister.
Fkw things more threatening to unanimity of
Labor thought and action could have been devised
than the Commonwealth Labor Government’s pro-
posal to close Parliament for the better part of a
year, in order that a scratch team of politicians
may join in a Coronation junket, lhe experiences
of a dozen years ago, when the Labor leagues and
unions were split into fragments by the mad jingo-
ism generated by the Boer war, ought to have
given JfiSHKR and his colleagues warning of the
danger of raising the old internecine strife among
their followers. Already the lunacy has shown
itself in the leagues, and the same old cheers for
the King and the same old counter-cheers for anti-
Jingoism have been heard in meetings of Labontes.
If these pleasantries don t spell trouble in the
very adjacent future, all The Bulletin can say is
that human nature isn’t what it was 11 yeais ago,
when half Australia was mafficking mad and
decent Australian girls were flinging themselves
into the arms of perfect strangers who were set-
ing out to help Cohenstein get the Chow labor he
lusted after. And if these disastrous forces of
disintegration break loose at a most critical time,'
the Government must be held blameworthy.
There was no more need for Fisher to expose his
forces to the ravages of the wild beast of Jingoism
in order to convince King George of Australia s
loyalty to the Empire than there is for him to
behead Kink O’Malley in order to prove that his
colleague’s big hat isn’t a flying machine, it looks
like a reckless turning of mad dogs loose on Aus-
tralia’s parlor stairs, and the leader who does that
sort of thing isn’t a safe man for Ins job.
Exit, W. Kidston.
The re-arrangement of the Queensland Cabinet
has no doubt, been the result of a powerful and
well-timed squeeze. For some time before the
thing actually occurred, Brisbane knew that a
conspiracy was afoot, led by three leading Bhilf-
ite malcontents, to get a new Brenner and nil
some, at least, of the Ministerial vacancies.
Kidston s reluctance to deal out the unallotted
portfolios was the real root of the trouble, ihe
fact was that the only people to whom he dared
offer seats in the Cabinet were repugnant to hurt.
The MaCARTNEy-Foksyth-Tolmie trio lie regarded
with a most unkindly eye ; and the trio, in all pro-
bability, cordially reciprocated. If these politicians
entered the Cabinet, Kidston’s boss-ship was a
dead letter ; and he was well aware of that fact.
A Cabinet in which Denham had nearly half
a dozen friends and the Brenner nearly half a
dozen enemies could only wind up one way.
All the time the pressure upon him was getting
greater. Then Chance threw a lifeline his way.
He might have kept afloat for a while longer, but
how much longer he did not know. He hoped to
make some capital out of the .State A rights cam-
paign. -But, coming south, he felt the public
pulse and knew then that there was no glory to be
got out of that foredoomed struggle. The death
of his chief supporter, Blair, made the outlook
still gloomier. So he did the only thing a canny
man could do—he went for the lifeline, and was
landed in a dry place with £100(Q a year to
comfort him, practically for life. So ends the
political career of a man whose good record of
democratic service is damned by a cowardly volte-
face. Had he absolutely refused in 1907 and IJOB
to mix with the Bhilp crowd under any circum-
stances, his record would have been distinctly
creditable. But he was continually dallying with
the Tories behind the scenes, and finally the lories
roped him in. In all justice, however, it must be
said that the extreme section of the Queensland
Labor party did not give him a fair deal.
At the 1907 election he gave the Labor party a
magnificent offer of Reform legislation, and only
asked it in return to go to the country with him
on a mutual understanding, without surrendering
a single party principle. The party unwisely
refused, and opposed KiDSTON-ite candidates
with even more hostility than it did the 1 hilf-
ites. The immediate result was that Labor
dropped at that election from 34 strong to 17, and
the Tories increased their waning hold. Then, throw-,
iug over his Democratic comrades in a shameful
manner, Kidston delivered himself to the Tones.
Of course, the usual specious lies were told. Ihe
Tory lion was to lie down with the Democratic
lamb. The lion is still tiieie; but where is the
lamb? Kidston was, indeed, never intended
by nature to be a lamb when tbeie
was a lion about. He was never willing
to teiuain a lamb and be eaten. He would
take any shape that would save him fiom
the beast. After ALFRED DeaKIN, lie was probab y
the finest opportunist in Australia. He could
adapt his views without the least trouble to suit
any exigency. From being a somewhat labid
Labor man he drifted into Democratic waters a-nd
finally perished on the shoals of Toryism. He
posed as a man who did not go on the money
market to borrow, and wound up as an unmitigated
cadger at the pawnshop. Ble rose by cursing
Bhilp and died embracing him. He ruined a
powerful middle party and made the name of
KiDSTON-ite stink in the nostiils of every good
Democrat. Under the guise of being a strenuous
States-Righter be carried the banner of Fat until
Fat collared that emblem and told him he could
carry it himself. A favorite phrase of his was:
•• We should try to attain linality in matters.” He
has gained his goal, and achieved finality. He
iias turned his coat for the last time 1
A Glass Railway in a Hot and Naked Land.
The proposal that concrete or glass sleepers should
be used on the Queensland Western railway is an
unpleasant reminder of how this country s timber
resources are dying out. Australia was never
very well supplied with timber, and through
burning, ringbarking, wasting and exporting, it
has already ai rived at a stage when it is very
badly supplied. Mail may be generally described
as a timbermaniac, or wooden-headed speculator,
or treeless vandal. When he shifts this year’s
crop of potatoes or wheat he recognises the neces-
sity of planting next year’s crop to take its place ;
but when he shifts one century s crop of tiees ,ie
seldom plantsnextcentui y s; asarulehe lets things
slide. Only the State, which lives for ever, is
likely to take any real interest in a harvest that
ripens some 30 or 50 or 100 years after planting,
ai.d if tlie State doesn't take an interest in it, and
doesn’t constitute itself afoiesterou a gigantic
scale, the work is almost invariably neglected.
Then things happen to the wretched country
which has thrown away its opportun.ty. It loses
its beauty and becomes dull, yellow, shadeless and
suustruck. The rainfall diminishes. When the
rain does fall it runs off rapidly through lack of
the old entanglement of tiee-roots to detain it and
bank it up. Worse still, when it runs off it takes
much of the soil with it, because the roots which
used to hold the earth together and diminish
the hurry of the waters are gone. The land
becomes one of extremes—of sudden floods and
long, dry spells. It also becomes a laud of stoniis,
squalls, blizzards, hurricanes and tornadoes. The
baby hurricane or whirlwind, just opening shop
or starting in business, can be diverted and broken
up by a patch of forest; but when there is nothing
ahead of it but the bald, white skull of the land,
with a scurf of herbage here and there, it rages
and gathers strength, and in its fury it drives the
whole country before it during dry spells, and
shifts such soils as the spasmodic rains haven t
already ie.. "'•d. Then when the duststorm is over,
the smothered ~k is dug out of the paddock
at the back of the Shallow of Death Hotel, and
the tragedy is reported in the local rag. ihe end
of that country is that it becomes another btihara
or another Gobi, and the nation which blotted out
trees to make way for sheep and vegetables is left
with neither sheep nor vegetables, and has
to keep its clothes in a hole in the ground for
want of wood to make a chest of drawers with.
Half the world is drifting towards this condition
because it is, for the moment, the line of least
resistance. If a country possesses 30,000,000 acres
of forest, and the trees take an average ot
30 years to mature, the nation has two
alternatives to choose from. It may cut down
and replant 1,000,000 acres per annum, and so
keep its supply of timber intact. Or it may goon
a tree-drunk, and cut down 1,000,000 acres a year,
and plant the cleared land with wheat and town-
ships and the things out of which beer and wme
are made. The second method looks like the road
to affluence, for after 20 years there is still a
supply of timber ahead, and there are also
20,000,000 acres of rich cultivation which wouldn’t
be there if the forests had been maintained.
But, all the same, the country is on the
way to being a desert. Australia is already
a great deal too far on that way. If
100.000,000 acres of the interior could be planted
with tall timber this continent might have a new
climate, a new rainfall, and a perfectly new out-
look. Then there would be no need to make glass
sleepers for the Queensland western railway, lhe
habit of making glass is not one to be recklessly
encouraged. Sand is reclaimable, and has possi-
bilities in the way of fertility. Glass has no such
possibilities. And whereas man knows how to
turn sand into glass, he hasn’t the faintest idea
how to turn glass back again into sand or earth of
any sort, tpiy more than he knows how to turn
bricks back into clay, however easy may be the
job of turning clay into bricks. If Western
Queensland could be made a land with gteat
belts of foliage and traversed by railways
that rested on wooden sleepers (wooden sleepers
fertilise the land when they decay), it would
be a very different sort of place from the one
which now looms ahead —a featureless wilderness
cobwebbed with 3ft. Bin. lines that are broken
every two feet or so by something that reflects
the scorching radiance of the sun like a maddened
decanter. A glass railway stretching across a
hairless and incurable land seems to be the limit
in the way of desolation. There is nothing worse
this side of Gehenna.

< The Blundering Wowser.
At the end of this month an interesting shindy
will begin on the doorsteps of numerous N.B.W.
pubs. In the days when the Wadk party thought
there was political profit in the Wowsers,
*• Reduction ” was carried, in various places, and
180 pubs were ordered to disconnect their beer
pumps. Mostly, however, Bung was given a
year or two to get himself used to the idea of
handling some other weapon. But before the
fatal day arrived when the pumps were
to be put out of service, the general
election of October, 1910, arrived, and along
with it the local option vote and the knock-out of
the blundering Prohibitionists. Everywhere the
electors decided “that the number of licenses
existing in the electorate continue.” Then the
18G Bungs who had previously been sentenced to
death began to wonder where they came in. In
view of the sentence of death, was the thing that
BUNG held on the date of the October vote a
“license”? If it was, then Bung reckons that
the October vote was a commutation of
the sentence, and that he can’t be suc-
cessfully prosecuted for keeping his door
open and his pump at work after the date
fixed for the execution. Large masses of
opinion have been piled up on both sides of the
question ; and the courts will soon be trying to
weigh the two lots to decide which is the heavier.
The whole of the trouble arises out of the stupen-
dous folly of the Wowser crowd. There is prob-
ably a large majority of the people who
believe that there are too many beer pumps
in the land, and that a few hundreds of
the frowsy rookeries and poison shops which
house them could be shut up with great advant-
age to the community. But when the Wowsers
took charge of the anti-pub campaign, and chal-
lenged the State to make their own brand of
Prohibition the test question, then those who
refused to trust the Wowsers had but one course
open—they had to swallow for the time being
their own convictions in favor of fewer pubs,
or of State pubs, and simply knock the
Wowser out. If, therefore, the courts de-
cide—as seems likely—that the previously con-
demned 186 pubs were saved by the 1910 vote,
then Judkins and the rest of the raving brother-
hood may get what satisfaction they can out of
the fact that, instead of reducing the number of
pubs and diminishing “the curse,” they have
saved 186 pubs from extinction. ■

Bloodshed.!
“ 8.J.F.” considers the blood-spillers :
" If it is the people's will that the Common wealth is to
be supreme,” said the, S. M. Hkrald, the other day,
apropos the referendum, “ there can be nothing more
to say. But it is perfectly clear to thoughtful minds that
the end of it all must be anarchy and civil war. These are
dire words to write ; but they are written in grim
earnest, and we believe they represent the truth.*
We have been hearing quite a lot about blood-
shed lately. Only the other week an English Tory
paper quoted with gusto a remark of the chairman of a
Wade banquet. This philosophical luminary' said that, if
the Labor partv finished as it had commenced, it was
hard to sav what this country would be in a few years.
He feared that ultimately there would be bloodshed, and
it would lie a serious thing if this should be brought
about by political adventurers. Bloodshed would be a
“ serious thing ” if it were brought about by any agency
—even through the Wade Government sending an army
of provocateuis, in the shape of policemen, to arrest
Bowling and his confreres at Newcastle, in the midst of
incensed strikers, when the business could have been
pacifically accomplished in Sydney. The Tory mind is
diseased with its dreams of bloodshed, because it
regards gore as a potent factor of reform. It is
alwavs prophesying bloodshed. Who, then, are to
be the shedders of blood? In the insistency of these
Tory prophecies, the wish seems to be father to the
thought. There is a yearning for an excuse to chastise
the beastly proletariat and teach them their proper status
in the scheme of things. The authorities aie always
eei'-ed on by these fatuous promoters of social unrest,
who are the invokers of a dead order which can never be re-
suscitated, and would-be restorers of an economical system
that can no more be revived than Piiaraoii. With
a keen appreciation of possibilities, they are incessantly
whispering: “ Don’t nail bis ears to the pump.” These
people are the true Anarchists, because they suggest and
provoke the happening they pretend to deplore. In the
name of the maintenance of law and order, they in-
sidiously promote licentiousness and disorder. Regulated
murder is to their minds the triumph of jusiiee, so illogi-
cal and intellectually disordered hate they become.
Tories and Nihilists are at the extreme polts of the social
order ; but they are. both essentially anarchical; the one
in an insane attempt to continue an impossible fixity in
human affairs, the other in an equally insane attempt to
revert to a condition of troglodyte individualism. The
true and rational development of the human race involves
no bloodshed, and courts no appeal to physical force.. It
is an intellectual evolution. To the end of the world,
however, there will be atavistic reversions to primal types
—decadents, and undeveloped human iuefficients. The
pretended fear for the exhibition of physical force,
violence, bloodshed, will be a characteristic of the
degenerate Tory mind as lona - as the Tory mind shall
persist; but with tS:° process of the suns its expression
will become both feebler and more sporadic, until it
faints to a mere echo in the great chorus of human
progress.
—♦
One way and another it is reckoned that Maori -
land mopped up nearly £7.000,000 of Bull’s good
loan money during 1910, and that Stale expects
to close its financial year on March 31, 1911, with
something like £1,000,000 in hand. Also, Joseph
Ward mentions with pride that the revenue for
the year will be the largest on record, and will
be, at least, £1,000,000 more than it was for the
previous 12 months. A joyous person is Joseph
by reason of this gilded prosperity, and by the
time the great crash comes Joseph, if he has any
luck at all, will be no longer there. Quite a sur-
prising amount of prosperity of a sort can be
created out of loans. If a borrowed £1 note was
indelibly earmarked before being paid out as part
of the wages of some toiler who labors on the
country’s permanent and reproductive works, and
careful account was taken of the number of times
it came back to the Treasury in the course of a
year, it would possibly be discovered that one
loan sovereign may easily make £5 of revenue in
a year. The other side of the case is that when
the 20s. of borrowed money fails to eventuate, it
is liable at times to cause 40s. worth of downfall
and astonishment to the Treasurer. Victoria, in
1891, borrowed about £600,000 more than in 1886,
and its revenue rose by nearly £2,000,000. In
1896 it borrowed some £2,000,000 less than in
1891, and despite a most vigorous heaping on of
new taxes its revenue fell by £1,600,000. That is
why a wise Treasurer makes a study of the great
art of knowing when to get out of the wet and
leave the obloquy to his successor.
+
The Prime Minister, by investing in State securi-
ties part of the gold he has received in exchange
for notes, has now acquired an income of about
£lOO,OOO a year, and it might easily have been
£300,000 or £400,000 a year if his Government had
had the courage to go the whole logical hog with
its note issue. Also, the Government would have
had a much safer, as well as a larger, income if it
had gone the whole logical hog. This £lOO,OOO a
year is neither loan money or tax money ; it is just
an endowment that descends like the gentle dew
from Heaven through the exercise of a li ttlecommon
sense. (Here it may be mentioned that, so far back
as 19/8/1899 The Bulletin published a leading
article headed, “To Make Great Wealth out of
Nothing,” and it is an evidence of the despairful
slowness of things that it has taken nearly 12
years to get even a beginning made at this
simple and obvious proposition.) Unfortunately,
Andrew Fisher seems to have no idea of using
his windfall as a sinking fund to clear Australia
of its load of debt. Apparently, the proceeds
will just be spent as they come in, after the same
fashion as the land sale money and similar easily
got receipts.
Squatterdom may have been able to lure a good
portion of Cockydom into voting anti-land tax
at past elections with the yarn that ‘ the interests
of all men on the land are identical,” but, all the
same, the signs are that the farmer is beginning
to have his doubts. The Molong (N.S.W.) Shire
Council lately put the doubt into words by resolv-
ing (rather indefinitely, it is true) that the
Pastures Protection Act should be “ brought
more into touch with up-to-date require-
ments” in regard to the rabbit. Among
other methods of scotching bunny, the
P. P. Act provides for poisoning. Now, this
suits the big land-grabber very well ; it is a more
or less effective device, it is comparatively cheap,
and it is capable of being used on a large scale.
But the poison is sudden death on the birds
which pick it up wholesale, and the slaughter of
the birds means the multiplication of crop and
fruit-destroying insects. The insects are the pri-
mary cause of the farmers’ doubts aforemen-
tioned. They don’t directly injure the big land-
holder to any extent; they don’t worry his sheep,
and, as a rule, all the crops and fruit he raises aren t
extensive enough to attract any business-minded
insect. On the other hand, the rabbit doesn’t
worry the average farmer much. He has no need
for poison, because bis small area is easily pro-
tected by wire-netting and a few traps. But the
insects play the very devil with his crops and
fruit. Consequently—since the farmer owes the
blastiferous insect calamity to the big land-
grabber and his poison-cart —the farmer is ger-
minating doubts whether he really basso many
interests in common with the big land-grabber as
the big land-grabber tells him he has.

“The Old Soldier”: General lan Hamilton’s
recently published book on “Compulsory Ser-
vice ’’—the volume for which he was rewarded with
the title of Inspector-General of the Oversea Forces
—casts a quantity of unconscious mud (1) at the
British “ Regular,” (2) at Britain’s alleged pros-
perity. For example, Hamilton says (p. 106) :
The majority of the 18- to 19-year-old regular recruits
enlist because they have just ceased to be boys, and are
unable 10 find regular employment as men. About four-
fifths of them come to us because they cannot get a job
at 15s. a week. .. . The reluctance of employers to take
weedy, overgrown youths of 17 and 18 has markedly in-
creased since the passing of the Workmen’s Compensation
Act. This is good for recruit!..g.
And further: —
If, under altered conditions, hungry hobbledehoys
knew that they would be called up for continuous hous-
ing and feeding during the winter, the Regular Army
would begin to shrivel up from the roots. I know ihat
all this is not very glorious, but it is true.
In short, the voluntarily-enlisted Atkins is not-
es has so often been claimed by opponents of
citizen service—an adventurous, big-souled patriot
who barges into the national army, partly from a
natural liking for peril, and partly from a love of
his country. He is just a luckless youth who is
forced into the 'i auks by the heavy, boot of Want—
a state of things that is induced, not by his un-
willingness to work, but by the fact that there is
no work for him. Thus England’s shrewdest
military assailant of compulsory service admits
that if the poverty-stricken Briton’s condition is
improved at all, the enlistment will cease. But
otherwise, in the absence of compulsory service,
the only way to keep the nation’s present “ regu-
lar” army from “shrivelling up” is to keep a
large section of the population on the edge of
starvation.

a husband was seeking a divorce from his wife on
the grounds of her habitual drunkenness (she ad-

acles. Yet the same Judge, being asked to de-
fine the meaning of a “living wage” for a
married man with five children, would hardly
name a larger amount than 40s. to 50s. a
week. And seeing that the “keep” of a house-
hold is not generally understood to include rent,
clothing and the many little extras that even the
poorest-paid flesh is heir to, the sum of 30s. for
food and tire doesn’t appear to fall short of an ordi-
ary “living wage” allowance to the housekeeper.
Therefore the learned Judge was either mocking
at the legal definition of the “living wage” which
so many married workers have to struggle with,
or he was misrepresenting the wife in this case as
a singular sufferer. He asked a question which
invites a counter query. If it is a natural thing
for a Divorce Court Judge to judicially question
the possibility of a wife being able to keep seven
persons on an allowance of only 30s. a week, what
is his idea of a reasonable living wage for a married
man, and why doesn’t he impose his idea upon
employers of labor ?

The Vie. Australian Natives’ Association held its
annual celebration a few days ago, when repre-
sentative speakers strongly appealed for a “ yes ”
vote in the referenda. Indeed, the only opponent
present was Weary John, the State Premier,
whose Toryism is now 18-carat and hall-marked.
Last year the A.N.A. conference smote State
Frights in one eye by deciding against the per-
petual 255. agreement; and the coming conference
will almost certainly close up States Frights’
other eye with a resolution supporting the pro-
posed extensions of Commonwealth power. The
Argus and the Australasian are, of course, very
s'ld about it; and they put their appeal for State
Blights on these grounds :
The individual only surrenders so much of his precious
personal freedom as is necessary to enable him to live as
a civilised man in society. Localities cherish the right
to look after their own roads and other municipal affairs.
But if North Melbourne looked after its section
of the railway that runs to Essendon, and Ken-
sington had to look after its fragment, and
Flemington had its own Railway Commissioner,
and Ascot Vale and Moonee Ponds had their own
control, what a beautiful service it would be!
Yet Australian trade is just as much an entity as
the railway to Essendon is ; and naturally the
Argus and the Australasian don’t say a word
regarding the in inner in which a State is going to
deal, for example, with a monopoly that spreads
its tentacles over the whole of the continent.
■» ,
O ■IE of the Common wealth’s crying needs in the
near future will be a sulficiency of military officers,
in view of which fact the Minister of Defence
might as well call upon the permanent staff to
show cause why in some of the States—or in Vic-
toria, at any rate —it has .adopted a policy of
unfriendliness to senior officers of the militia.
For instance, there was the ease last year of three
captains of recognised efficiency being “failed”
in their examination for promotion to the rank of
major. Firstly, difficulties were put in the way
of their coming up to the scratch, and when at
last they got the chance to present themselves, they
had the mortification of being plucked by a Board
of examiners, consisting of a major and two lieu-
tenants, one of them attached to the cadets.
The constitution of the Board of examiners
amounted to an arrogant claim of superiority for
the lieutenants of the staff over the captains of
the citizen Soldiery. Another case of the alleged
ill feeling shown by the staff to its outspoken
critics concerns a major who served with distinc-
tion in Africa as a Cohentingenter, and was pro-
moted for special services on the field. This
Victorian officer took with him to the war a
Martini-Henry rifle of obsolete pattern, which
was promptly consigned to the scrapheap by the
British Army authorities. They replaced it with
an up-to-date weapon. Long years have elapsed
since the officer in question returned from thb
war, yet he recently got a command from the
Permanent Staff in Melbourne to return the silly
old fire-iron which he was ordered to discard in
S’Africa. In these and other instances the Per-
manent Staff autocrats have seemingly made it
their business to irritate the men who, m a time of
national trouble, would be ordered to the front,
whilst the Staff muddled things in the back-
ground.
“Briner” writes: —
The story of how the Dutchmen, under German pres-
sure, are fortifying Flushing, so that, when the Germans
invade Holland and reclaim that lost province of the Ger-
man Empire they may find ready-made fortifications to
prevent British or French assistance arriving by sea,
recalls a whole lot of old history. Holland and Belgium
have both been part of the German Empire; in fact, it
was a Dutch colony which built the first city
of Berlin, and a Dutchman has been Emperor
of Germany before now. Germany’s unfathomable
grief is that when Holland and Belgium drifted
away, the mouth of Germany’s great river, the Rhine,
passed into foreign hands. The bosom of the Rhine is
laden with German commerce, yet that commerce can’t
reach the sea except by' the permission of Holland. The
arrangement is against Nature, and there is bound to be
trouble over it. Anyhow, Holland arouses little sym-
pathy. The story of the great revolt against Spain is pic-
turesque in its Way'; but the picturesqueness diminishes
a little when the case is more closely inspected. The Dutch-
men were not a purely Protestant race fighting against
Catholic aggression; they were fully one-half Catholics
themselves. They'were good seamen compared with the
Spaniards, and they put up one or two good tights behind
stone walls, but as soldiers they were so wretched that
the camp <igns of William the Silent were mostly fought
with foreign mercenaries—French, German, Scottish and
English. When they had practically secured their inde-
pendence, the dominant Calvinist party commenced a
persecution, not only of the Catholic Dutch, hut of the
Protestants who urged toleration and refused to
believe in the complete horrors of Calvinism, and
the horrors of this persecution made a large
section of the people ’ regret * the dead and , gone
days of Charles the Fifth. But perhaps the worst deed
ever done by Holland was the ruin ,of Antwerp. That
Belgian city' on the Scheldt was the commercial centre of
Europe. Unfortunately, at the division of the country,
the mouth of the Scheldt fell into the hands of the
Dutch, who built forts there, and blocked all commerce,
and made great and beautiful Antwerp a beggar. Now—
this is where the great jest comes in—Holland is repair-
ing and reconstructing these old fortifications at the
command of Germany, not for the destruction of Bel-
gium but for its own undoing. The trade it stole from
Antwerp has left it and gone to London and Hamburg.
Belgium, which it ruined in the days of its pride, is now
richer, stronger and more populous than Holland itself.
And Holland is to-day almost as much a part of the Ger-
man Empire as Bavaria or Pru-sia. It has almost ceased
to think of itself as an independent country.

When a syndicate Bill is before a Parliament its
sponsors invariably urge its adoption on the
grounds that it is such a little one. Everything
possible is said in dispraise of the value of the
concession sought, and much oratory is fired off to
prove that the syndicate is a whole-souled patriot
whose only object in life is to “develop the re-
sources of the country.” The song that is sung when
the Bill becomes law is a different song altogether.
The latest instance of this change of tune comes
from the folks who have engineered the latest
concession. So innocuous were the provisions of
the Mount Balfour Railway Bill supposed to be
when it was brought before the Tasmanian Par-
liament, late in the last session, that the public
expressed no particular interest in the fact that a
Labor member stood godmother to the poor
miserable, puling kid, on which the House was
implored to have compassion. And this is how
the foundling is now regarded by its real pro-
genitors, vide the Mount Balfour directors’report,
just published :
As you are aware, the directors have been absorbingly
occupied in securing the passage by the Tasmanian
Legislature of the Act of Parliament empowering the
company to construct a railway. As an indispensable
adjunct to the commercial development of the com-
pany’s property (and incidentally of the whole Balfour
mining field), and independently, as an asset of the
utmost potential value, the directors have felt that it
behoved them to spare no effort, not merely that a railway
communication should be established, but that the com-
pany itself should secure the rights of construction. . . .
The Act not only clothes the company with the most
ample authority for carrying out the work of building a
railway, but it also grants extensive powers for the con-
struction of electrical works and machinery for the gene-
rate m and transmission of electricity for motive power,
lighting and other purposes, with power to erect
ami construct works and dams across the Arthur
and Fraukland Rivers, to sell its electrical pro-
ducts, and to construct and levy tolls in respect of
wharves, piers, docks, etc., at Stanley and Smith-
ton. Toe Bill is, in fact, a most comprehensive one,
embodying concessions of such a liberal and practical
character as have enabled the directors to confidently ap-
proach strong financial groups in Tasmania and abroad,
with results which satisfy them that the required capital
for the development of the whole of the company’s various
enterprises will in due course be available.
Some day, when the ideal Labor party gets into
power, a law will he constructed which will cancel
every concession granted to a syndicate whose
ante and post statements regarding the value of
the concession do not tally. It is about time that
the ambit of the present law concerning the
obtaining of goods by means of false pretences
was extended to syndicate promoters, as it already
is to the concoqters of pills who use a misleading
label with fraudulent intent.
In view of pending big loans, McGowen,
of N.S. W., takes the Under Treasurer with him
to the Oohenation.
No doubt his own health counted for
something, and the death of his wife counted
for more, but the death of John Blair, of the Rock-
hampton Bulletin, counted for most in W uilie Kid-
ston’s retirement from Queensland politics. Wullie
leaned on Blair more thau-on anybody else ; and
when Bleiv died Kidston had to decide between a
safe seat at £l9OO a year for 15 years and a hor-
ribly unsafe seat even on the £3OO a year basis of
a common M.L. A. As for a long continuance of
liis Premiership, Kidston knew that the Philp
influence was making that quite impossible.
A quaint collection of scraps and rejects
are mentioned to carry the “Liberal” banner at
North Sydney, where the previous member was
lately blown up. Among them are Dugald
Thomson, Joseph Carruthers, Hogue, Edward
Pulsford, W. H. Wood, Innes Noad, E. M.
Clark and the oft-mentioned and imperishable
Pumpkin Smith. Dugald Thomson has declined
to stand, but quite a lot of the others are willing,
Pumpkin Smith included. The sun never yet
rose upon the day when Pumpkin Smith wasn’t
willing.
The poor Victorian landowners seem to
have abandoned all idea of leaving their unim-
proved values to be assessed by the Federal Tax-
gatherer. Anyway, there has been a furious
demand for both of the Land Tax Act booklets—
Federal an’d State —published by Frank Hayes, of
Melbourne. No less than between 20,000 and
30,000 of the guide books were sold within three
weeks, which suggests that realestaters in general
are profoundly anxious to discover exactly how
little their taxation liabilities really are. After
studying the difference between the Common-
wealth Act and the local Act, the poor fellows are
almost ready to admit that the Labor Government
has left them much to be thankful for.
Pathetic item from the daily papers :
“The Scotsmen of Melbourne have expressed a
hope that the Prime Minister during his visit to
Great Britain this year will go to Scotland.” Mr.
Fisher (the Prime Minister who made the mess of
the Commonwealth Note Issue) replied: “I will
go to Scotland if I have to crawl there ” :
Ere with your fellow Scots you sup
Note this : From London town
To Scotland it’s a long crawl up ;
Your strong point’s crawling down.
It was mentioned last week that Britain’s
Territorial Army, which isn’t a very large
force even on paper, is just now 44,106 men and
1514 officers short of the force it should be. This
takes no account of the quality of the force, which
is quite a different matter; in 1910 the Terri-
torials were supposed to muster 315,842 strong,
but out of this alleged host only 210,107 had
gone through even the moderate amount of train-
ing required to make them “effective.” These
days a thick gloom hangs over the voluntary army
of Bull. The Territorial idea was a sort of final
effort to prove that voluntary enlistment would
fill the bill, and the bill begins to look vacant.
According to the Argus :
The Prime Minister (.Mr. Fisher) was asked on Saturday
to express an opinion upon the motion submitted to the
Labor Conference by Mr. Holman for the abolition of the
High Court and the Senate. Mr. Fisher said that in
the Federal Labor movement the High Court was not
attacked, and never had been attacked. If the increased
powers sought by the Government were granted by the
people, the restrictive interpretation of the Constitution
by the High Court would cease with the removal of the
restrictions. Jf Hie people freely exercised their powers
by referendum from time to time they would make sub-
stantial progress.
It is seasonable to twitter now about the “sub-
stantial progress” secured by the use of the refer-
endum. But there was a time when Fisher
thought little of progress and less of the refer-
endum. And that time was when he declined a
demand to take the people’s opinion on the capital
site question.

Very beautiful upon the mountains are
the feet of “Miss Gibbs”—at least. The
Bulletin presumes that they are, but it has
months ago given up calling at Sydney Royal to
verify the fact. The lady has become a long-
distance or old-age pension event, and long-
distance events grow wearisome to those who
attempt to watch them from first to last. There
have been many of them. There was, for in-
stance, the case of the thug mentioned by Max
Adeler who was condemned to smother his best
girl and tben stand on one leg for 47 years.
There was the instance of .Tehoiachin, King of
Judah, who did 37 years in gaol without the
option. There is the club-swinger who swings
for 66 hours ; and the oldest liar who says that
when he was a boy he thought nothing of chop-
ping wood day and night for three weeks
consecutively; and there is the person who is
walking three times round the world for a wager
of eighteen pence made with Phileus X. Brass-
bounder of Syracuse (U.S.A.). The Seven
Sleepers of Ephesus have been mentioned among
long distance events; and there is the Upper
House; and the writer once dreamt about
a fraudulent company promoter who had
been sentenced to imprisonment for life in
a decayed hansom cab just outside Spencer-
street railway station, Melbourne. Likewise
the Siberian railway is a fairly long affair,
and Peary’s tale of how he found the Pole is long
also—that is to say it is tall, which is the same
thing. And seeing that “ Miss Gibbs ”is now in
her twenty-first week, length is distinctly her
strong point also. This may be very pleasant for
the management, but it doesn’t appeal to the in-
dividual who writes notices about the show.

The Sydney playgoer is again notified that
“ Miss Hook of Holland ” replaces “ 'Pom .Tones ”
at Svdnev Criterion on Saturday (18th) in order
to give William Cromwell a chance of saying
good-bye as Slinks, the dilapidated Dutch person,
who tells a total stranger, in a nervously-defiant
way, that he has “ lived about these parts all his
life and knows all the local gossip.” There are a
few drayloads of crimedy in the bright Dutch
play, and a fine string of musical numbers, in-
cluding the fine male chorus “Bottles,” which
was always a certain encore-winner when the last
Clarke and Meynell co. produced the piece here.
With a capable group of new principals and Crom-
well in his old part of Slinks, “Miss Hook”
should have a very busy week.

Hugh J. Ward is a busy man these times.
When he was on the way to do the first of his
“Seven Days” at the Palace, his bath-heater mis-
behaved, and the Ward home threatened to go up
in smoke. The fire brigades saved all but the roof,
and Ward now has the plumbers onhis hands—and
a man with plumbers on his hands has almost
enough to do without running a show of his own
and various others for charity. In “ Seven Days”
Ward’s little company of comedians lias, however,
got hold of a little thing that almost plays itself.
H.J.W. himself doesn’t have to make up at all;
he can just rush in from his argument with
the plumber and explain confidentially to his
friend and the hidden burglar that life is
pretty wretched since he got divorced. No man
known to Australia can handle the farce-comedy
more cjeftly than Ward; and he has the neces-
sary picturesque support in Grace Palotta, Gelia
Ghiloni and Maud Chetwynd. The advt. men-
tions last nights; but so far it only mentions them
in the same vague, non-committal way that a
Sydney man might refer to the possibility of toler-
able weather happening presently.
“MY MATE,” AT MELBOURNE KING’S.
Max Clifton fas Gunyak dots some tracking.
“The Whip,” at Her Majesty’s (the Syd-
ney one), has now been running for 60 days, which
is a good record for any horse. Tire pace has not
diminished, and the dust-cloud at the back of the
noble animal is no less thick than it was the month
before last.

The fame of Alexander Prince, concertina
player, travelled round the world before him
by talking machine, and his music must be known
in many corners of the earth to which he will per-
sonally never penetrate. When he walked on to
the stage of Sydney Tivoli last Saturday, in ordi-
nary morning dress, an avalanche of welcoming
applause descended upon him. Then he took his
caterpillar-like instrument and started to play
“ Tantihauser ” as if he were sitting at the key-
board of the Town Hall organ. In the hands of
an artist like Prince the asthmatic instrument
which alternately gasps and grunts in a furniture
van on a public holiday becomes a wonderful
thing, with no troublesome throat affection, but
with wonderful powers of mimicry—especially
with regard to church bells, organs and bagpipes.
With his trusty concertina. Prince could ring a
congregation into church and roll out the anthems,
6r play a regiment of cheering Scotchmen into
battle. Miss Odeyne Spark, a subdued and grace-
ful English soubrette, is the other newcomer.
Her voice is small, but she uses it well, and her
dancing deserves honorable mention. An
elegantly-dressed burlesque of the hobble garment
is her trump card. The song-words for this item
are above the usual average, and the air is in-
fectious enough to be sent to Little Bay Hospital.
Ihe knockabout turn of Wild, Willie and West
and the football of Velanche’s Dogs are the other
main revolutions of the programme. Ethel
Loftus, Baby Wktson and the two Pounds girls
are also among those present. Julian Rose of
the Hebrew Wedding, and Miss Yetra of the
Wire fade off the bill this (Thursday) evening.

In these days Maggie Papakura is leading
her company of Maori warriors and singers around
the suburbs, Maggie and her management having
decided that, though the mountain might in time
go to the Maori, the two will come together more
quickly if the Maori goes to the mountain. The
change of policy is proving most successful.
The Maoris give a picturesque show; and
crowded audiences are signifying their approval
in the usual manner.

BOURNE KING'S.

Edmund Duggan, actor ,

“The Gay Grisette ” has found a name as
well as a local habitation at Melbourne Royal.
The advt. now describes it as “a musical sparklet
in two bubbles”; which is the sincerest form of
flattery in which the matter could be stated. Cer-
tainly there are sotnei pretty little bits of music
and two or three neat ditties in the “Grisette,”
and these improve on acquaintance. But the dia-
logue, the glaring irrelevancies and the con-
struction—the carpentry, so to speak—of the
farcical story are beyond forgiveness. The
brown Sultan of Sahara, prowling around in
quest of a 100th lady for his harem, is even more
trying than the black cannibal, princess from
Capetown, who might as well be Irving Sayles in
a hobble skirt. Yet the crude Sultan has one dis-
tinctive virtue. He seems to be the only man in
the whole caboose who isn’t suffering from the
effects of previous giddiness. He is the one chas-
seur de chiffons who never gets confronted
by a vision of the past. The audience natu-
rally expects his 99 haremites from Sahara
to come tripping into the Beer Garden disguised
as a ballet—but they don’t. The cost to the
management would be too great. Many girls
. adorn the entertainment as it is, and nothing is
wanting to make “The Gay Grisette” very at-
tractive except a new story with'some of the pre-
sent characters omitted, and a sweeter assortment
of singing voices. As regards the small comedian
and his ballad of Captain Ginger, there is no de-
mand- for a finer top-note and middle register.
He is merely required to talk his song tunefully
and audibly. One night last week he sounded
almost like a sudden attack of the croup.

“ My Mate,” at the King’s, is teaching
the Andersonian public to moderate its appetite
for villainy in Australian melodrama. Practically
the villain doesn’t count in this mild romance of
the Bush. He gets very little chance to
merit detestation, and when he is shot
down, like a dawg, by the second-best
young man, his fate appears rather
a sad one. He might have lived to
amend his disposition and become a shire
councillor. And the survivors are not wholly
faultless, with the exception of Miss Duggan.
Behind the feminine gentleness of Roy Redgrave
there lurks a dangerous tendency to pony-racing
and things. With the pale limelight streaming
on his poetic pose, the beauteous bushman speaks
of a pub at Moonee Ponds as though he were
givingit a free advt. ; and when his mate is escap-
ing from justice (the killing of Beckett deserves a
little justice, anyhow) he puts the fugitive in the

way of mending his broken fortunes with a big

“ My Mate ” is a commendable Australian drama
in so far that it tries to he humanly interesting in a
more matter-of-fact manner than that of the lurid
imported article. The early comedy scenes be-
tween Bailey and Miss Wilton have nothing todo
tftith the case, but they are at least breezy. What
the play mostly needs is grip. It never catches
right on to the sympathies of the unsophisticated.
Innocence suffers no injuries, and the path of
mediocre virtue leads only to a pony racecourse.

“ The Luck of Roaring Camp ’’ is still
roaring at Melbourne Princess’s ; but “ The Angel
of His Dreams ” is announced to be “ in prepara-
tion ”; and as angels rarely roar, the welkin is
shortly in for a rest. As mentioned before, the
Camp’s chief defect is that it doesn’t roar along
the lines laid down by Bret Harte, and if it lives
to be a hundred it will not escape that reproach.
Perhaps a couple of thousand years hence, when
Spring-street is a jungle and the Camp is pro-
duced by University students after months of
preparation as one of the Old English classics,
only the most eminent scholars will trouble to find
fault with it; but while the American writer’s
work is fresh in the public mind, the tiresome ob-
jection will continue to be raised by dramatic
critics—who raise valid objections because it is
their job to do so, just as it is the farmer’s job to
raise crops.
The melodious “ descriptive vocalism ” of
Frank Harwood, who is an up-to-date edition qf
the “ star comique” of yore, has been added to
the bill at Melbourne Opera House, where his
many verses, with their long refrains, appear to
be filling a want. The Six American Dancers are
still in their first bloom of novelty. Cooper and
Bait, and the Kavanagh Boys and Fasola the
Wizard are less new than they were. The wizard,
however, was unwittingly responsible for a fresh
and original sensation last Saturday afternoon.
Tile lion that should have waited in a cage
behind the scenes for the purpose of being
substituted for the Lady in Fasola’s most
cumbersome and wide-spread “illusion,” got
loose and went for a stroll. Having strolled across
the stage whilst Fasola was attending to other
business, the animal proceeded to Little Collins-
street through the stage door, followed by one of
the wizard’s black-faced assistants. When the
lion turned into an office building the discolored
gentleman closed the front door on the wandering
beast, and stood on guard outside until its car-
riage was sent for. An evil-thinking lion with
mischief in its mind would have walked upstairs
and devoured all the quaking inhabitants of
the offices thereabouts ; but this decadent scion,
of a noble race merely smiled through the
glass of the front door and wondered what was
happening. A strong body of police was sum-
moned to keep back the populace that had fled ;
also the fire brigade came along with a proposal
to enmesh the animal in a safety net. None of'
the dramatic possibilities of the scene were realised.
In due course the lion was confronted with his
cage, and, havitig jumped into it. he was taken
back to the Zoo whence he came. He will appear
no more at the Opera House, the manager says.

“The Sage, The Cherub and The Widow”
is the largest lump of sugar now on offer at West’s
Melbourne address. It is the tale of a middle-
aged idyll, commencing across the bed of the
second unit in the trinity, who happens to be
fever-smitten at the moment. There are some
sweet rural pictures in “Nemours and the River
Loing.” The humorous section is led by “His
New Lid,” which isn’t the cleverest thing the
biograph has done. “ Houndsditch Anarchists”
comes as a gloomy postscript to the cabled infor-
mation, and “ The Silent Message ” has the virtue
of disclosing many horses. In fact, the picture
has a horsiness that must be slightly infectious,
for the audience almost whinnies its apprecia-
tion.

The programme at Adelaide Tivoli has
been braced up with some new turns, notably a
conjurer with royal and European testimonials,
and the Blessings. The juvenile pantomime has
left the Royal. One will watch with curiosity the
future career of Vera Bromley, who, at the age of
(apparently) 11, plays a low-comedy pantomime
“ dame ” of the red-nosed type. Max Maxwell
has just started a season of Bland Holt melodrama,
with Miss Beatrice Holloway as the star.
The various Picture shows—the Empire and
West’s and the Casino, are the chief—soon let
the “Battle of Houndsditch” relapse into small
type. Like most real fights, it was not nearly
sp effective per film as the faked ones prepared
for show purpose only. The Dandies are perhaps
the most notable amusement feature of Adelaide
at present. Branscombe advertises them as an
‘‘.immediate success,” It is just what they were
nqt. Their success was quite gradual, but steady ;
the fact that the management has just had to add
an extra thousand seats speaks for itself.
E. H. Macartney, who has been included
in the reconstructed Queensland Government and
made Minister for Lands, is the law-partner and
political pupil of A. J. Thynne, who was Minister
of Justice and Attorney-General in Tom Mcll-
yraith’s borrow, boom and bursts Ministry of 1888-
90. This completes the vicious circle ; Queensland
thus gets back to the spot whereon it stood 23
years ago—leaning up against the same old pub,
and waiting for the same old door to open so that
it may start the same disastrous old financial
drunk. . „ .
It is not too late in the year ‘£o remark
that Sands and MeDougaH's Melbourne Directory
for 1911 is larger in length, breadth and thickness
than any of its 54 annual predecessors. The in-
crease of matter is mainly devoted to the country
side of the Directory. In the alphabetical sec-
tion, originally monopolised by Melbourne and
suburbs, the residents of Ballarat, Bendigo and
Geelong are duly stated ; also all the professional
and business names in other parts of Victoria.
The country towns in all have 1880 pages of Sands
and Mac’s invaluable book of reference.
THE ANARCHIST IN ENGLAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Anarchist in England, or the Houndsditch Mur-
ders. Happened in England, and to be shown on Monday
night. The awful finale in Sidnev-street, where two
criminals kept at bay upwards of 1000 soldiers and police,
who had the assistance of Maxim guns and artillery. The
final scene, when the fire breaks out and Roasts the
Murderers, is faithfully depicted.— Moving picture advt.
in the Melbourne Herald.
The anarchist is placed, at last—the blighter has his use !
It is his province, nowadays, new interest to induce
In those who go to picture shows. The picture-bosses
must
Accordingly produce new sounds behind the scenes or
bust.
Oh, hear the crash of coppers’ boots.
The sizzling flesh, the screams and hoots !
Hark to the pop of crackling bones! the creak of limbs
in pain ;
God bless the grilling anarchists that did not die in vain!
Let all right-thinking people rush to watch the agonies
Of anarchists that brightly burn like torches in the
breeze,
Kindly observe, dear friends, with what uncommon, cool
delight
Revered white-bearded Liberals roll gaily up each night,
Safe, sober men are they to whom
Some things are joy, though more are gloom.
And anarchy and homicide and Sosh alike are sin
So they sit there, and dwell on roasted anarchist, and
grin !
Oh, what alovely picture ! Justconsider what it means—
A Thousand Cops and Tommies Giving Blowemupski
Beans!
When at the last the spirit of the 1 ist. wild blighter broke,
Think how they must have howled before their souls
went up in smoke !
Now, this is worth a sprat, at least—
A cinematographic feast— j
To see the flames mount up ... and, as they rise,
imagine then
Those last, unwilling, dreadful groans of slowly-roasting
men !
VICTORIA.
STONY.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Mary Conly, who was considerably overlooked when
she made her previous re-appearance, is to give a fare-
well concert in Melbourne on March 1. She vvill sing the
“ lnflammatus” with Fred Beard’s Victorian Festival
Choir at the back of her; and if the Town Hall has seats
vacant this time, Melbourne will deserve any unkind
remark the songstress can pass on it. Mary Conly is one
of the few Victorians who have established themselves as
concert singers in Britain, and the only one who has come
back to Melbourne to find herself treated as an artist of
small importance.
The 600th performance of “ The Arcadians” happened
at the Shaftesbury (London) in Christmas week, when
three matinbe performances were added to the total.
And “ The Arcadians ” deserves it. Compared with other
notable successes in comic opera, such as “ The Merry
Widow,” it deserves 6000 consecutive nights. By the way,
Robert Courtneidge,' who re-opened the Shdftesbury
Theatre with “The Arcadians,” has another charming
production in his daughter Cicely, born in Australia some
18 years ago. Recent photos present her as a very
pretty girl. It goes without saying that she has
a fine set of teeth and a smile that reveals the top
row of them. Teeth have been a craze in English theatri-
cal circles for years past. The dentist has watched over
the molars, incisors, etc., of growing girleens, and filled
them with so much admiration for their pearly treasures
that they are for ever showing them. Theirs is a meaning
smile. “Just look at my teeth!”—-it couldn’t say it
plainer if it could talk.
The Taits are going to produce “It’s Never Too Late
To Mend” in biograph drama form at Melbourne Glae-
iarium. “ Willie ” Lincoln, who was an Australian play-
wright in his youth, and is nowadays running the
“Paradise" Pictures at St. Kilda, is understood to be
responsible for this biograph version of Charle- Reade’s
drama. Picture show condensations of familiar stories,
also original film dramas of tiie sort now imported from
America and Europe, might as well be locally fixed up.
There’s no better country than Australia for open-air
photography, and few that are nearly as good.
Roy Redgrave has been turned on to a dramatic version
of Thackeray’s “Vanity Fair,” with the inimitable Becky
Sharp in special quantities of “fat” for Miss Eugenie
Duggan. A “big” feature of the piece, which will be
staged at Melbourne King's Theatre on the co.’s return
from the West, will be the Duchess of Richmond’s famous
ball at Brussels on the eve of Waterloo.
“ Snod ’’: In Ballarat 10 or 12 years ago, Wilson iTorbes
put up Ned Duggan’s ambitious spasm, The Eureka
Stockade.” Artist Little was on the spot to giVe the
stage scenery local color. I saw him paint a back-cloth
under unique conditions. He wanted a view of Ballarat,
showing Mount Warrenheip, and he got it by just open-
ing the back door of the stage, and painting his scene
from Nature, the cloth hanging in the position in Which
it was to be used at night. If Ned Duggan had been able
to open a back door somewhere, and get the right atmo-
sphere of the'historic fight, the play would have been a
belter one. As it was, Ned—who played the blameless
hero—came up from a shift below in shiny top-boots and
impeccable shirt-front, and blithered about “dear old
mother and the dear old flag,” and sich. The only real local
color was the wooden staves actually used at the Stock-
ade. They were borrowed for the occasion from the Old
Colonists' Association, and got broke or lost or some-
thing. Come to think of it, weactors allgot broke or lost
or something that season.
“ Exile ” (No. 2): “ La Milo,” the best-known Australian
turn of the English music-hall stage, has lost her power to
draw a full house. At Leeds, showing for one week, two
houses a night, she is not (11/l/’ll) able to even draw a
full gallery, where admission is only a “ tray.” The sharp
decline is due mainly to the lack of opposition on the
part of “ Modesty,” “Morality ” and “Mother of Seven,
teen ”in the correspondence column of the dailies. As
long as meetings of protest were being run and the Jud-
kinses opposed the turn, police were needed to regulate
the rush. To-day one can drift into a seat in the stalls
at any time. So the time should soon arrive when La
Milo, “ fresh from her conquest of England,” will pay a
return visit to Australasia. Cruickshank has gained
great rapidity with the pencil, and still shows a little
Australian feeling by adding “Perhaps” to the “Food
will Cost you More ” gag beneath his cartoon of Lloyd
George.
“Vic.”: Now isn’t this rich? Dolly Castles as Prin-
cipal Boy in the Drury Lane “Jack and the Beanstalk,”
and Sybil Arundale imported from England as Mel-
bourne’s Jack. To be sure she succeeds, but nothing'
like Dolly at Drury. Dolly is dubbed the best “ boy ”
there in living memory. She is the third Australian one
at Drury, the others being Nellie Stewart and Maud
Beatty, sister of May. Had Dolly been proposed
as the Melbourne Jack, there would have been a
cry of enraged protest So Williamson cannot be
blamed, though I believe he could have got her for half
the money she is paid at Drury. But now, having got
the Hinglish hall-mark, what a boom little Dolly will be
in snobby Melbourne’s next Christmas Pantomime ! Her
first public appearance was with a song in the Melbourne
Theatre Royal, at a matinee for Sophie Osmond’s benefit.
Sophie had the grand idea of bringing out Amy Castles’s
sister, who, however, was a small squeak. She went to
the Elsternwick Convent School, where she made quite a
hit as the heroine in scenes from “La Sonnambula.” Her
next public appearance was in a High Mass Choir
at Father Robinson’s church at Camberwell. Amy
had just returned from Europe for the first time. Both
gave solos, and Dolly’s was the more ambitious. Then
she studied in Europe, and returned for Williamson’s
Gilbert and Sullivan co., supported by Howard Vernon.
The third sister, Eileen, will most likely be in the chorus
of the Melba-Williamson co., with a chance for little
parts.
Walter Bentley and Ancelon —the latter Bentley’s
partner in the voice-cultivation business —are down for
another “dramatic costume recital ” at Sydney St. James’s
Hall this (Thursday) night.
“D.J.”; Wonderful the intelligence of these wild
beasts. That performing lion at the Melbourne Opera
House, after walking to the footlights, escaped by the
stage-door and turned into Little Collins-street, where he
made at once for the office of the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals, which is in the Temperance
and General Buildings. That office was unfortunately
shut, so we’ll never know whether he went to com-
plain about the matinee hat or to protest against having
to do an extra shift on Saturdays without extra pay.
“Melb”: While the new and obstinately-named
“ Colonial ” Picture Theatre, Bourke-street, on the site
of the old Coliseum and the more recent Queen’s Hall,
laboriously completes its gorgeous preparation, the dis-
placed Waxworks people have been taking time by the
forelock, and open smartly as the Star Theatre, which is
to rival the Colonial in the same pictorial line, though,
apparently, a morsel cheaper—at threepence and six-
pence ; ladies threepence all over, as I understand. The
Melb. Waxworks were established in the generation be-
fore last by Mrs. Williams, a Tussaud acolyte. She mar-
ried “Know Thyself” Sohier, so called from his per-
sistent advts. for'people to fetch along their phrenologi-
cal bumps. He was drowned in a shipwreck. Then
clever Kreitmayer emerged, and for many years has done
much skilful puttying.
“ TOM JONES," AT
SYDNEY CRI.
Percy Clifton as
Squire Weston.
Harold
Thorley
as Tom
Jones.
“Exile” (London): I have just heard Sousa and his
band. The combination includes six hot-air blowers with
glasses, seven who are wholly bald, and six who are bald
in spots. Four wear beards. The bassoon is Bft. long,
and there is a tympanist who deserves a column to him-
self. He represents the dernier cri in drum-banging.
He pats the tymps., scolds, caresses and whispers to
them, and they whisper and (occasionally) howl back at
him. I have walked behind Niagara, between the wall of
water and the cliff of rock ; I’ve heard Carlton beat
South ; and I’ve looked inside a Cornish boiler under
repair. Amalgamated, these are all noiseless along-
side Sousa’s drums. The cornet player is a revela-
tion. There has been nothing like him since Levy.
And then Sousa ! He is a very' wizard of music. Sousa
plays with that band of hisas Kubelik used to play with his
violin. He causes the volume of sound to shrink, fade,
disappear, only to compel a monstrous body of noise to
begin, grow, creep upward and gain force with every
wave. Unlike all the great conductors I have
seen, Sousa conducts with his fingers, and the thousand
and one movements of each separate digit is recorded on
the instruments. He opens one hand slowly, gently, and
the sound from the band issues softly, svyeetly, perhaps
to be crushed out of being by a sudden closing of that
fist, perhaps to swell to a roar and a yell and a yelp sug-
gestive of 14 zoos in full cry. Sousa’s band will be with
Australia shortly.
“Parisine”: Yvette Guilbert’s Autobiography is just
to hand, with the French and the English obligingly on
opposite pages. She seems to be just the same exactly
truthful person as Eleonora Duse. There are numerous
portraits not sugared in the least, showing- a very plain
woman indeed, just short of the ugly, and Ivith no figure
—a bit of steel or a flat-iron. A fat, jealous comedienne
said Yvette was as thin as two Englishwomen. This
Yvette, with the painful, agonised, plain face, tells her
awfully painful, unvarnished story, the most pitiful in
theatrical annals. Edmund Kean’s struggles with poverty
were joy to Yvette’s. Her father was a worthless
gambler, who brought a gently nurtured wife to such
abject indigence that she and her little daughter had at
times n 6 fire, no food and no roof, and had to go out
peddling. Mother and daughter trimmed women’s hats,
which they then hawked. A circus proprietor gave some
help and wanted to train Yvette for horse-riding; but
the mother feared that her bones would be broken, and
then they both would starve. After a while, being on
the verge of starvation, she got a small job on the stage,
but soon decided to go in for the music-hall. She got a
chance in Lyons Music Hall —and was hissed off five
nights running. Then Yvette bought for 12 sous, on the
Seine Quay, a little book of songs. That made her
fortune. All was plain sailing afterwards for the very
scraggy genius with the very piping voice,
“Harrison O.”: There is something inspiring ahout
the stage person’s proud contempt of the idea that Bull
can ever be annihilated by any foreign or other devil. At
Rickards’ Bourke-street establishment, the other even-
ing, I listened to a lady who, in leggings, an abbreviated
skirt, a tunic, a military cap (tilted in a devilish manner)
and a riding.whip, heaped scorn upon the craven brood
of doubters. Cried she, contemptuously, flailing her
leggings with her whip the while: —
“ What is all this talk about invasion ?
Telling us that England’s unprepared !”
She then proceeded to cast satire at the quaint idea of
anything happening to Ma so long as she possesses her
“ gallant territorials,” who
“ Have not fought yet,
But are ready to, you bet!”
Somehow, she failed to set my vague fears re Britain
entirely at rest. Possibly, it was owing to her resemblance
to another young lady whom I heard, a while back, sing-
ing a similar ditty, in which she urged Australia to rely
for defence upon its “ brave Boy Scouts.” She was a
nice-looking girl, and she did her business well; but the
logic struck me as defective.
The modern musical genius is apt to be an intensely
practical cove, with one eye glued firmly on the main
chance. F’rinstance, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, de-
sirous of giving Strauss’s “ Merry Pranks ” this season,
has to fork out £2O. Considering this composer’s present
vogue, his profits, judged by these royalty charges on
even this short piece, must make those of a popular
musical hotch-potch composer look silly.
’Murka is the Promised Land of the rhymesters (Jewish,
in many cases) who compose the words and melodies of
sickly sentimental ballads with long refrains concerning
mother. Colored photographs on a screen are used, now-
adays, as an illustrative background for mawkish narra-
tive ditties; but this modern Yankee notion is not es-
sential to the popularity of the songs. American fondness
for‘‘'mother ” sentiment dates'back to the halcyon days
.Of burnt cork minstrelsy'. The grandparents of the rising
generation had a tear standing- gently in each eye when
the most popular of blackened tenors sang “ A Flower
from My Angel Mother’s Grave,” and a number of black-
ened brethren muttered the chorus softly to their banjos.
In those long-ago times “mother” was usually dead.
Of late years she has been a going concern, and in
most cases the hero or heroine of the awful poem
has been deeply attached to “dear old mother, be-
cause there is no other.” The author of the first-
song that rhymed “mother” with “ other” may be said
to have started a great gold-producing industry. At the
present time a writer and composer, who built his fame
on “Break the News to Mother,”is drawing £lO,OOO a
year from royalties. The popular attraction of his songs
is partly in the tawdry melody, and partly in the cheap
sentimentality, but chiefly in the rockiness of the verse.
No rhyme about mother must run very smoothly or fail
to excite pity for the suffering sex, if it is to command a
sale of, say, 3,000,000 copies in America and abroad. Take,
for instance, the beautiful ballad in which the heroine’s
mother desires her son-in-law to give up all idea of re-
suming cohabitation with his wife :
“ She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your
own ;
If she wishes to forget you, you will please let her
alone ;
She has come back to her old mother
Because there is no other—
She’ll be happy in her own Sweet Home.”
Regarded as poetry, the verse is not faultless ; but, con-
sidered in its bearings on the marriage question from the
shemale point of point of view, it is just lovely.
The Adelaide Literary Theatre is rehearsing its first
production for 1911—“ The Servant in the House,” by
Rann Kennedy. The play something resembles “The
Passing of the Third Floor Back,” and will be staged in
April next.
“ Book ware ” : There is an interesting new book by-
Adair Fitzgerald, on “ Dickens and the Drama.” “ Boz
wrote about half a dozen plays, which gratified those who>
saw them acted, though they have no more dramatic
fibre than those of Walter Scott. On the other hand, see
what dramatic material has been made by other play-
wrights from the novels of these two. Dickens’s oper-
etta, “The Village Coquettes,” had a fair run, too. His
other plays include “Mr. Nightingale’s Diary” and
“ The Light house,” and he had a share in “ No Thorough-
fare,” which caught on with Fechter, Webster and
Neville in the cast. Even the theatrical profession was
unanimous as to Dickens being one of the foremost actors
of the day. Robson tried his eminently successful part
in “ The Lighthouse,” hut could make nothing of it.
“ Morten Bayfig” : Re Ernie Leno, dancer (B. 26/1/T1).
Ernie is not the late Dan’s only son. Leno had five
children—three sons and two daughters. Dan himself,
In his young days, was a champion step dancer. He won
the'world’s championship for “ clogs ” at Oldham in 1883.
The son starts where the father left off—at the Pavilion
Music Hall.
“ Busk ”: An American photo of Emelie Melville, taken
only last Christmas, has been reproduced here. She
must be over 60, yet looks only 30. Time with her and
Nellie Stewart goes, ns Hamlet says, like a crab, back-
wards. Emelie’s first Melbourne appearance was in 1575,
in “ Girofle-Girofla.” But she was popular in America
before ever she came to Australia, and was reported even
then to have four children, as Mrs. Derby. She returned,
in 1882, and again, many years later, she was cheerfully
taking subordinate parts, like Nancy in “Martha.” Ex-
cellent in comedy, too, she was, especially as Polly Eccles,,
in “Caste.” Her best parts were Girofle and the Grandr
Duchess. The admiration of her bootmaker once nmusedi
me. Says he, with awe : “ She cut to pieces, in one day,,
a 355. pair on the Sorrento Rocks.” , She, and Alice Rees;
were both fancied to have a tendresse for the beauteous;
Gtigliehno Verdi, otherwise Bill Green, who had the addi-
tional lustre of being a married man.
“ Snod ” : “ Haresfoot,” in a recent Bulletin, wonders;
whether Nellie Mortyne’s name was taken from Ellen
Mortyne, a favorite actress in 1858. It was, in-
directly. Nellie married Charlie Mortyne, a son of the
famous Ellen. Charlie, a very good actor with a fine
cultivated voice (he was admirable as the aristocratic
father in “ Our Boys ”), seems to have fallen on evil days.
After several years of battling and dry-blowing out back
of Kalgoorlie, Charlie turned up again on this side, and
played in Melbourne and Sydney with Bohemian Cole.
But he is out of sight altogether at present.
“Busk”: Apropos the famous beauty-actress, Mrs.
Jordan, and the last King William (B. 2/2/T1). There was
never any formal marrying between them. Mrs. Jordan
never married anybody. Her right name was Dorothea
Bland. Her mother was said to have been a Miss
Phillips, one of a clergyman’s three daughters who all
took to the stage. Dorothea Bland, becoming an actress,
had a daughter by Daly, a manager. This was the first
of her 15 children. The daughter ultimately married an
Indian official, but went on the stage as Mrs. Alsop.
Dorothea, her child, and her mother, scuttled away to
England, to get clear cf pecuniary obligations cunningly
woven round them by Daly. Tate Wilkinson, a York mana-
ger, engaged Dorothea. He said : “ With that child you
must be called Mrs. I’ll name you Mrs. Jordan, because
you came over the water.” Thus came the name of the
actress, only second in popularity to Mrs. Siddons. She
then lived with one Ford, and had four more children.
The girls were either two or three, and Mrs. Jordan’s
great anxiety was to provide them with large marriage
portions. She gave up Ford for the Duke of Clarence,
with whom she lived about 20 years. They lived at
Bushey Park, Kew,and had 10children, theFitzclarences.
One, the Countess of Errol, was ancestress of the Duke
of Fife, married to King George’s sister.
“ Parisine”: The success of the hour in Paris is the
opera of “ Don Quiehotte,” at the Lvrique. The words
are by Lorrain ; the music by Massenet, composer of
“ Herodiade,” which suggested the “ Salome ” of Strauss.
Lorrain was a poor working cobbler, mending shoes, in
the Rue Sonnerard, only a decade ago. He sent an article
to the Revue des Deux Mondes, whose generous editor
pronounced him a genius. The readers concurred. A
liberal subscription enabled poor Lorrain to go to the
south of France, his health being bad. There he wrotij,
the play, in verse, of “Don Quiehotte.” Editor Bruoe-.
ti6re and the cobbler’s other admirers were entranced!
with what they declared to be by far the best stage ren-
dering ever attempted. The opera was produced at
the Theatre Victor Hugo. Lorrain hurried up to. Paris,,
saw the play, and died just after. So he was a hit luekier-
than Tobin, who did not see his “ Honeymoon,” and only;-
about as lucky as Bizet with “ Carmen.”
The perambulating panto, is a varied conglomeration;
these days. Anderson’s Juvenile show, “ The Old Woman;
Who Lived in a Shoe,” which left Melbourne for a tour-
t’other day, carried a camp-following of guardians,,
schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, besides its horde off
youngsters, adult performers, stage hands, etc. It was.
only on these terms that the Vic. Government oould he
placated.
“ X.X.” on monorails and gyroscopes :
Re S. A. Railway Commissioner Moncrieff (B. 26/l/’ll) and
the monorail. The first monorail in Australia (so far as
the writer knows) is being- put down from the Pike River
to the Loxton Farming Co.’s property, near Renmark
(S.A.), by T. C. Walker. It is about five miles long ; the
truck weighs about lOewt., costs about £l5, runs on a
151 b. rail, and one horse can work it with four tons of
wheat on the level with ease. The horse walks alongside
the truck. So far, the experiment has been a success.
Walker is a son of the late T. Walker, of Walker and
Swan, well-known railway contractors in the ’Bo’s;
and to him belongs the wreath for introducing the mono-
rail to Australia. The writer has seen the truck work, and,
under proper conditions, it has possibilities. Brennan’s in-
vention is the gyroscope, which for the Pinnaroo country is
absolutely useless. There are plenty of the Walker type
of vehicles used in France, and a mono-railway has been
working in Ireland for years. It is quite true that
Moncrieff, after Walker had his truck finished and the.,
material on the ground some hundred miles from Adelaide,,
had a mono truck built. It weighed 1| tons, would carry-
four tons of wheat, cost over £5O, and had an outriggjer-
wheel, so it was mono in name only. This was laughed at,
so much that it has been scrapped, and the inventor is.
having another try.

PENEOLD'S
WINES
The average suburban alderman has a fine
perception of fiis duties. North Botany Council
(N.S.YV.) lias decided that the old name is tooold,
and ought to be shot. Ascot, it is suggested,
would smell nicer, and wouldn’t be so suggestive
of tanneries and bone-mills and boiling-downeries.
Besides, it is so Hinglish. However, in this case
the new name misses the mark ; for if they do call
it Ascot, nine-tenths of the public will always in-
stantly think of something dead or stiff—a bird or
a horse or some other reptile.

The Steamship Own-
ers’ Federation is a decent
employer enough,.hut some
of the acts of its officials are
very careless. To the Fed-
eration was left the job of
allotting “home ports” to
officers. In any but the
home port the officer must
work on the ship till 5 p.m.
every day. At the home
port he leaves the ship as
soon as it is tied up, and
stays away until an hour
or so before sailing time.
The Westralian liners, for
instance, have their eastern
terminal port at Sydney,
remaining there for a week ;
and the officer who has his
home in Sydney and has
Sydney awarded as hi?
home port is a lucky man.
But either out of pure cussed -
ness or in wi-ld carelessness,
home ports are allotted the
other way about. The officer
whose home is Fremantle is
awarded Sydney, and the
Sydney man is awarded
and the man who
would like a day or two with
his family in Melbourne is
given Albany. Some men
are awarded the uncertain
coaling station of Catherine
Hill Bay, and Catherine Hill
Bay consists of a jetty and a
few rows of coal skips. The
sailorman’s life is not too
attractive, nor his work too

From the Oldest Inhabitant :
Duntroon homestead, Queanbeyan, now absorbed in the
Federal capital area, is one of the old family properties
in N. S. Wales. It belonged to the “Campbells of the
Wharf,” the first of .whom, Robert Campbell, merchant,
came from Calcutta in‘l796. He married a sister of John
Palmer, the Commissary-General, in 1801, and died at, his
country home, Duntroon, in April, 1846. The Australian
Campbells are descended from the Campbells of Ashfield,
cadets of the house ipf Duntroon, Crinan, Arpryleshire,
which place the family held from 144 S to 1857. John
Campbell, the father of Robert, of Calcutta and Sydney,
was the last laird of Ashfield, near Crinan ; so when the
Wharf Campbell got a grant of some land on the western
skirts of Sydney, lie named it Ashfield, after the old hotne
in Scotland. He sold the property to Joseph Underwood
early in the last century, and on Underwood’s death the
estate was cut up, and Ashfield soon started to grow.

A strong suspicion arises that some un-
known scientist, or group of scientists, has dis-
covered a method of bringing down rain at will,
and is just making dead sure that the invention
will work before demanding to be bought
off. Either that or someone has discovered a
method of making bricks or travelling trunks
out of air, and is using up the atmo-
sphere so fast that what remains is insuffici-
ent to hold up the moisture. Or possibly the rush
of airships athwart the sky has introduced a new
element into the case, and the new element is pro-
ducing unlooked-for results. At all events the
weather for the last two years has been unfit
for a fish to bfe out in without an umbrella.
France has been drowned twice, and there was a
moment when it was reckoned tint half the repub-
lic was under water. The lest of Europe has
been drowned at least once. It has rained heavily
everywhere except Sheol, and it doesn’t do to be
too certain even about that. Anyhow, there is a
fearsome story about a dark gentleman who
bought a macintosh in Rome—be would natur-
ally go to 'Rome—and required a small hole
to be made in the lower rear so that
a tail might come through. He also ordered
an asbestos umbrella, and the money he put
down burned a bole in the counter. In view
of the suspicions that the present rain isn’t
natural, it would be a fair thing to advertise for
the man who is doing it, and assure him that if be
will communicate with the Hague Peace Confer-
ence and mention his price, the matter will re-
ceive serious consideration. If he doesn’t care to
have anything to do with the Hague Peace Con-
ference, let him address his letter to the Mafia or
the Young Turkey Party. Whoever he (or they)
may be, it is time to open communications with
him (or them) at any cost. Unless the present
foolishness is stopped, a cloud-burst may fall on
the British royal family, and when the slush has
cleared away the country may be a republic or a
military despotism.

The wedding ring still stands for some-
thing more than a mere piece of jewellery. An
insolvent lady in the Adelaide Court last week
admitted that aiot of jewellery she was wearing
had not been included in her schedule of assets,
and obligingly took it all off at once. Judge
Russell, noticing that one ring was of the plain
gold-hoop variety, ordered her, in a shocked tone,
to put it back on her finger. But she had other
uses for it. Looking round for her husband, who
was standing at the hack of the room, she made a
neat shot for his head with it. For this outrage
she apologised to the Court; hut she still refused
to have anything more to do with the badge of
servitude to “ that Thing who calls himself my
husband.”

The port of Melbourne, which, like Syd-
ney, lias become large and bloated by the sys-
tematic starving of every other harbor in the
State, got a jolt last week during the
Marine Court inquiry into the circumstances
surrounding the damage done to the Cufic
whilst the ship was going through the Rip
in September last. The big White Star
boat, with the pilot still on the bridge,
was making for the open sea when she
bumped so violently that the bell above
the crow’s nest started to toll. The
captain, with 13,000 miles of sea ahead
of him, asked the pilot if he had felt |
the bottom ; but the sea-guide is said
to have answered: “No, captain; it
could not be. If she touched here she
would break all up.” So the vessel-went
on. In England, the bottom being ex-
amined, it Was found that the Cufic had
undoubtedly hit something large and hard.
So the Victorian Marine Court sat with
the idea of finding out exactly what it was.
During the captain’s examination he was
asked: “Is it a fact that your company
has some trepidation in relation to this
port?” To which the boss of the dented
ship returned this heartfelt answer : “ Yes,
it has. I always feel most uncomfortable
in passing through these Heads. It was
because I was so full of anxiety that I put
that question to the pilot.” Victoria and
N. S. Wales could eacii make a fine,collec-
tion of deep-sea language by sending the
master of every big ship a small blank
album with this inscription in gold letter-
ing on the cover: “ What is Your Candid
Opinion of our Policy of Lighting more Or
Less Haphazard on a Place and Making it the
one and only Port in the State?”
That mixed bathing would be as popular
in Melbourneias it is in Sydney if Grundy’s wife
would allow the facilities is proved by the experi-
ence of South Melbourne, whose council lately
notified that it was going to ask the Harbor Trust
to leave off prohibiting open bathing along the
foreshores. Taking this as a hint, thousands of
sweltering citizens went down to this nearest
beach during the recent hot spell and cooled them-
selves in a friendly and seemly fashion. But
presently “ Propputy ” became alarmed, and be-
sought the council to compel this progressive mo ve
and either compel the people to stay dirty and
full of perspiration or betake themselves down to
Cftrrum or thereabouts, where the campers bathe,
mixed and unmixed, and laugh Fat to scorn.
Apparently Fat’s idea is that the value of his
propputy will be damaged ; but on that subject
he might consult J. P. Wright and the other
people who a few years ago bought property on
the beach where the tens of thousands of Sydney
wash themselves at Manly. A block of land, sold
there nine years ago for £750, is now worth £4OOO
of any Fatman’s money.
In spite of having had Premiers to talk
serious things to him, the negro savage King has
had another outbreak in Pentridge Gaol (Vie.)—
just by wav of giving the all-men-are-brothers
party something to think about. Having battered
a fellow-prisoner, the blaek savage took out
a knife which he had somehow secured, and
proceeded to carve up the overs#fcr. On the alarm
being raised, one unarmed warder appeared ; and
King was chasing him round the premises, when
a second, also unarmed, joined the disturbance.
By strategy and the help of other prisoners, the
two managed to lay hold of the infuriated negro;
and the fact that the help of prisoners had to he
called in suggests that there is something radi-
cally wrong with the internal economy of Pent-
ridge. What sort of policy is it', anyhow, that
orders one or two unarmed men to tackle a furious
savage who lusts for blood like any other wild
beast ? He has already badly injured one warder :
do the authorities want him to kill another? If
so. isn’t the average warder’s wage rather low for
the job ?

In connection with the proposal to raise a
monument in Victoria to the deluded southerners
who lost their lives in the sordid S’African scuffle,
“it is intended to enlist the sympathy of the
general public, and one proposal is to interview
the State Government and obtain a sum of money
to form a nucleus to the fund.” The general
public’s sympathy can easily evade enlistment;
but the State Government is nailed down in its
offices, and unless Murray wakes up and says
“No” in a firm voice, Victoria may soon have a
stone impediment to traffic perpetuating the
memory of the assault on our new brother Piet,
whom Prime Minister Andrew Fisher has just
been visiting on Australia’s behalf. From a
national point of view it is an ill-chosen time to
dredge up the memory of the Great Hen Cam-
paign ; also, it seems inhuman to be looking for
money to put up a stone to the dead while a live
one-legged veteran, who has broken his artificial
limb while lumping potatoes on the wharf, has to
ask for a dole from the poor-box in the Melbourne
City Court.

“ E.S.C.”: lie the curious “ bloomers ” of
artists. I was wandering peacefully through the
Sydney Art Gallery when, coming to a halt in
front of “ The Gordon Riots ” (Seymour Lucas), a
bloomer rose up and shrieked at me. The soldiers'
are standing with fixed bayonets, and all the
bayonets are stuck on the top side of the barrels !
How a man could sight his rifle with the bayonet
fixed on top of the front sight I dunno. Also, it
would be mighty awkward at close quarters, as
any soldier can testify. Then, passing to Iks
Nou velle’s great work, the same bloomer glared at
me, except that here, in one case, the accommo-
dating bayonet was stuck on sideways !
AND YET SHE WAS NOT GLAD.
"Now, mind you come. I'll hare a lot of pretty
girls there.”
'Oh! I don't care about pretty girls. I'll come
because you'll be there."
It is announced by cable that Princess
Christian is fussing around as president of a coin-
mittee which seeks to “ find careers in the colonies
for educated women.” It seems a case of needless
excitement. There is already a career open, in
Australia at least, for every educated woman who
can cook, and the woman who can’t cook isn’t
educated.
HORSE ALLOWANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Why does a staff officer to the commander of the field
forces in Victoria get £36-yearly, horse allowance, etc.,
for performing-duties that are non-existent in an office
which is obsolete, to a commandant who has been abol-
ished I—Conclusion of an indijnant correspondent’s letter
to Melbourne Agr.
Rising early in the morning I proceed to feed the horse
(In the annual allowance it’s provided for, of course).
Then regretfully I say :
“ There’s not much to do to-day.
Though each button’s nicely polished,
The commander’s been abolished,
So no more we’ll go parading in the heat.
But it gives a certain pleasure
To reflect I’ve heaps of leisure
Since my offi :e has been rendered obsolete.
But, officially, I’m still upon his staff.
(In my gold-laced sleeve you say you heard me laugh l)
’Shun —
Vulgarity’s so very overdone!
My allowance still continues,
And I will not cut War’s sinews
By informing the Department that I haven’t done a
stroke !
If they’ll find some duties for me
That won’t weary me or bore me,
And supply a new commander and an office—Holy Smoke !
Then I'll show the young field forces
How to manage guns and horses,
And to get the bugles singing at the winking Morning
Star 1
All this fine instruction merely
For some thirty-six pounds yearly
Entered up as “ horse allowance ” and vague “ et cetera! ”
Chorus.
Oh ! economists may laugh
At a bill for oats and chaff !
But the work is very heavy, and it wears one out, of
course !
Still the privilege and pleasure
That I treasure beyond measure
(s to buy cigars and whisky for the comfort of my horse !

At the Special Licenses Reduction Board,
sitting at Sale (Vic.) the other day, a witness was
pileading for the non-disturbance of a pub at
which he had been putting up for 25 years. It
was a public necessity, he said : ,
The Chairman : Then how do you account for the fall-
iiiif off of trade at this hotel?
Witness : I attribute it to the Fisher Government and
the land tax.
The Chairman : But the Fisher Government and the
land tax were not in existence when tin; assessment
was made.
Witness : Their shadow was over the farmers.
It is wonderful how far-reaching that land tax is.
The hobble skirt, hitherto ignorantly regarded as
a fashion, turns out to be a necessity. When
Dad was driven to economise in beer, the girls
naturally thought it a fair thing to puli in some-
where too.

Magistrate •
1 ' r ’ ' ’ . ’ , „ , . T i , . ,
I am convinced from such experience as I have had of
criminal courts, extending over main \eais, that what a
man murderously inclined really dreads is not deat i, m
P There is no imagination so dull that it cannot take in
the terrors of the oat ; and I believe if such a pmmh*
merit could be made part of the sentence, even without
abolishing capital punishment, the deterrent effect would
be unmistakable.
I think even Crippen’s courage would have quailed on
that dark and wintry morning had lie known that he
would have had to endure a digging before lie was hung.
,
A strong, if not fatal, objection to flogging a con-
deni nett man immediately before leading, him to
the gallows is that the operation is
liable to exhaust his nervous system at
the time of the neck'-hreaking. A sounder
scheme would he to summon the doomed
criminal’s wife and grown-up daughters,
his mistress or best girl if he had one ;
also, his aunts and feminine cousins,
and flog them in his presence. This
would punish him morally, and yet leave
his physique capable of a full apprecia-
tion of the tragedy to follow. Useful
effects might be borrowed from the stage.
For example, while the relatives were
being flogged mock hangmen, suitably
costumed, might rush in with howls—the
prisoner standing the while on the drop—
and make as though to pull the lever.
It would he well, if possible, to anange
that they should he shot from trup-doors
through the floors, down from the ceilings
and out of the walls. At the height of
the excitement a mock reprieve might
be introduced. Then, as the wretch was
joyfully starting to leave the trap, the
fact that it was a joke could lie sprung
on him. The revelry should continue
until the condemned showed signs of
exhaustion, or until the stock of relatives
for flogging purposes showed signs of
petering out. If an execution, run on
such lines, failed, as Plowden puts it, “to
shake the composure of the condemned,”
then nothing would do it, and right-
thinking people might almost he tempted
to give up their efforts to reform the
Lower Orders, as a hopeless job.
The Law in Melbourne sustained a nasty
punch, the other day, through its presumptuous
and unjustifiable way of doing things. Being in-
formed anonymously that a Footscray citizen had
been philandering with a damsel of 15, it laid a
charge against him to that effect; then, lest the
damsel might be “approached,” it arrested her as
being a neglected child, though she was living
with her parents and working at a factory. When
before the Court, the prosecuting sergeant cheer-
fully admitted that he had no case, but had merely
arrested the girl, and would like her to be re-
manded, so that, he might have her on hand at
the right time ; whereupon a subservient Bench
; of seven honorariums calmly granted his request.
This amazing proceeding being appealed against,
Justice Hood sprang angrily upon it, remarking
that “ the course taken by the police was most
extreme and utterly wrong and preposterous.”
Also, the affidavits dealing with the pliability of
the magistrates, and their habit of truckling to
anyone in uniform. “ disclosed a most lamentable
state of things.” The damsel was thereupon dis-
charged, and the Law will have to hunt her up
again if it wants her,. ,
The Australian capital is threatened with
still another patch ot had luck, and Heaven knows
it has had enough of that substance in the past.
The Government pub is to he a dry and joyless
place, and the hope that fermented and spirituous
liquor might cast a halo over dreary Yassberra
threatens to vanish away. Dryness seems to be a
chronic habit with the ill-starred place. The
rainfall is about the lowest on the tableland. The
Cotter is now described *>y one of the papers
which barracked most earnestly for the ’Berra in-
famy as a mere chain of waterholes. The alleged
port ends :it high-water mark, so that it is dry ;
and it has no water catchment area, so that it is
dry again. And now the proposed dryness of the
Federal pub is added to the other dry, dry
miseries.
A continual source of worry
to the important personages who
pose mightily on Hospital Boards
is the disinclination of patients
to pay up after discharge from
the institution. At a meeting of
a Tasmanian Hospital Board,
the other day, the usual moan was
made anent the difficulty of col-
lecting dues ftom ex-patients.
The assembled Bumbles waxed
indignant over the ungrateful-
ness of these persons. “It would
be different if they were unable to
afford payment,” moaned the
fattest Bumble present. And he
instanced the case of a man who,
though earning thirty-three
SHILLINGS A WEEK, had not paid
for his sick child. He also com-
plained of the fact that old-age
pensioners often paid nothing !
The Board wasso cut up over the
matter, so shocked at this fresh
proof of the lack of principle
among the working-classes, that it separated with-
out tendering the usual vote to the chair.

“Stony”: Concerning the various little
cash collections made by the Australian Univeisi-
ties (B. 2/2/’ll), it seems worth while to mention
the fact that, besides its grabbing of entrance
fees, its examination charges, report rookings,
checking robberies and certificate Shylockings,
the University of Melbourne sells electors’ rights
at a guinea a time. Any reputable citizen of
Victoria, not otherwise qualified to vote at elec-
tions for the Legislative Council, is entitled to do
so if he holds the matriculation certificate of the
University of. Melbourne. Extortion : One
guinea. However, should the student have
been satisfied merely to pass the matric.,
without paying the Uni. the extra guinea,
lie Can’t vote unless, of course, lie does it
by virtue of Propputy. So the unproppufied
doesn’t get the vote by virtue of brains, but by
virtue of the extra guinea. Which, of course, is
another reason why the Commonwealth Constitu-
tion shouldn’t he amended. It is obviously mon-
strous to lessen the power of a State’s Propputy
House which is so careful to shut out brains if it
isn’t backed by guineas.
It is sometimes dangerous to be polite ;
'occasionally it is fatal. Last week a young graze r
gave up liis seat on one of Sydney’s overloaded
trains to a woman, and retired humbly to the
footboard. At a turn in the road he was thrown
off against a tram going in the opposite direc-
tion, and so tterribly injured that he died a
few, hours later. Yet in such cases nobody
is ever criminally prosecuted—not even the
Railway Commissioner whose servants take the
victims’ fares and bag them under false pretences.
If Mr. Johnson only Imd 13s. lid. in the bank he
probably wouldn’t dream of going into a shop and
buying a pound’s worth, and giving a cheque for
£1; and if he did behave in such a manner the
Baptist deacons would be almost sure to tell him
that he couldn’t be a Baptist Sunday-school super-
intendent any more. Mr. Johnson may be able
to seethe difference between that transaction and
taking a man’s penny in return for tram accom-
modation which has already been overdrawn ;
but there are a lot of people who can’t.

“ The Shover ” on a foreign trouble :
Ciudad Juarez (which is not pronounced that way at
all), is now the storm centre of the Mexican revolution,
according to the cable combine. I have been to Ciudad
Juarez. The “cily” consists of a collection of dirty-
white adobe huts, shacks, hovels and lean-tos, fit for a
mongrel race; and it is situated on the south bank of
the ltio Grande. On the other side of the river is El
Paso (Texas), where white people live in houses which are
mostly suitable for whites. The inhabitants of Juanz
provide a loud argument in favor of the White Australia

“The Pariah ” : “ Pick’s” mention of an
intrusive bird (B. 5/1/111) reminds me of Delaney’s
sow. VVe were camped in a fenced road, and the
old lady persisted in forcing her attentions upon
us. Hints as broad as axes and as long as spades,
flung by apoplectic cursers, were of no avail.
One night we returned to find that she had got at a
501 b. bag of flour. Forty yards away she stood
and leered derisively at us. The assistant grabbed
an axe but dropped it, and put on a Christian
smile instead. Then he took up a big turnip'iind
went into his tent. “ I’m going to try a win-by-
kindness on her,” he grinned cheerfully, as he
came out. The old girl saw him coming, and
gave ground when he got within 10yds. In this
order the procession moved for about 30yds.
Then the assistant placed the turnip on the ground
and left for home. She smelt it, got it between
her teeth, and then As it turned out, that
dynamite cap was wanted before the end of the
trip; but we did enjoy the fresh pork.
A COMPROMISE.

“Stan”: The green turtle (Hawksbill
variety) is an uglv, unwliolekmie-looking creature,
whose exterior doesn’t suggest an occasional ap-
pearance in the soup tureens of the mighty ; but
I’ll vouch for the fact that it can lick creation in
hanging to life and laying eggs. In December,
while a party of us were on «hb Franklin Islands,
opposite the Russell River estuary, we saw a
green turtle emerge from a little coral lagoon, and
with business-like promptitude make for an
adjacent belt of scrub, at the edge of which she
squatted and proceeded to burrow. The bog with
the gun,, who must have a pot at almost every-
tiling in God’s oreation, fired a charge of No. 4 at
the luckless Hawksbill, nearly blowing lier hea
off. After some commendable profanity trom
some decent members of the party, we invest.-
gated and found the creature had laid six eggs,
and the process was being continued. From
humane motives we brought the gun once more
into action, and a charge was fired point blank
into the mangled vertebra. Now, as I’m a living
sinner, that turtle, after that, kept on depositing
eggs until a tally of 41 had been reached, when
probably the magazine gave out.
“ Wigo Crook” on “ Contimpt ” :
A Bulletin par (29/12/10) re hats off in Papuan court-
houses, makes me thirst for information on the subject.
Gould a Judge or magistrate fine, flog or imprison a male
visitor who refused to doff his headgear? I have on set eral
occasions, in different parts, heard roars, something like
what I should imagine the Bull of Bashan’s to have been,
issue out of policemen when they have sighted a man in
court with his hat on. Always it seemed to be due to
forgetfulness, for in every case, bar one, the roared-at in-
dividual hastily removed his “ lid,” and the matter ended
at that. ~ , T „ ,
The exception happened at Marble Bar in the Nor -
West. While the Court was sitting a large, red-
whiskered tin-fossicker ambled in, wearing a big straw
hat, decorated with afly-net. One of hisneighbors gently
touched him and whispered something in his left ear. The
tin scratcher growled out loud enough to be heard even
on the bench : “ That hat’s all right, it’s going to stay
there ! ” This, of course, brought all eyes to bear on the
offending tile. 841 went over and ordered the owner of
the hat to shift it. Thefossicker refused to—said he was
a Quaker, and would wear his hat when and where he
liked. 841 grabbed the hat with one hand and the man
with the other, and bundled both out. This ended the
episode ; but beyond showing that John had a strong arm,
it proved nothing.
Was iq a pub in Southern Cross a few j'ears ago drink-
ing beer- and discussing this same subject with some
chaps from the pipe-track. One “ toughy ” from Queens-
land was certain they could do nothing to a man for
wearing his hat in court. He was willing to bet drinks
for all hands, and prove it as soon as the court opened.
He was promptly taken up. Half an hour later the batch
of us walked into the Palace of Justice, the Queenslander
with his hat on, and cocked at the most aggravating
angle. The place was fairly full. All hands stared, but
nothing else happened. Fifteen minutes slipped by, and
some of us who had a beer interest in the bet, and were
anxious to get back to the pub to collect, began to get
uneasy. You see, no time limit had been agreed upon,
and we feared the man who had taken up the bet might
insist on the hatted one remaining till the Court rose.
Our fears were groundless. He wasn’t on for facing a
drought like that himself ; so when 20min. had expired,
which all agreed was a fair go, he acknowledged defeat,
and we got back to the “ lick-hole.” Again, this proves
nothing, except that the character who did it wasn’t shy.
Doubtless some lawyer could enlighten, but he’d probably
want payment, and Pd sooner get information from an
Aboliar gratis, and it will probably be wrong in either case.

“Sheila”: Dr. Bromilow, at the Science
Congress-, said that among South Sea Islanders
the Jew’s harp is used as a means of communica-
tion in a secret language. The remark certainly
doesn’t apply to the Papuan. His thoughts are
on taro, yams, betel nut and tobacco ; and wire-
less telegraphy is far beyond his very small brain.
In many parts of New Guinea one comes across
the natives banging the mouth instrument; but
they do not, as Ruskin says, make their own or
other people’s “lives a music by striking the notes
rightly and in tune.” The gift of a “harp” to a
Papuan will secure small services, and an ex-
change of. wives has been effected for the
musical toy, 10 sticks of “ trade ” tobacco and a
box of matches. Still, let us not puff ourselves
up; for a white woman has been known to sell
her husband for less.
“Tip”: I’ve got two tons of sympathy
for “Gyp” and any other bushman or bush-
woman who can’t keep the tucker or the bees
from ants. Still, I’ll back these'few oz. of chemi-
cals to be worth more than tons of sympathy,
Make a solution of corrosive sublimate, one dram
in 6oz. of methylated spirit; soak rags about 2in.
wide in the liquid, and roll the strips around the
legs of the beehive, stahd, table, etc., where the
rain can’t get at it. No insect Will pass over the
barrier.

T.J.M. ; Agricola probably told the
pl a j n truth in his story (B. 5/1/T1) of the evi-
dences of surgical skill which he, found upon the
. , , , T ,
broken leg 5 but I m satis-
fled he was wrong when he credited the skill to
the bird. I have frequently caught maggies with
fractured limbs, but in no case were they spliced
round with feathers or anything else. On the
contrary, the wound was invariably left open and
kept perfectly clean, no doubt to avoid blood
poisoning. Perhaps the magpie that “ Agricola ”
found was an out-patient at the local hospital.
OLO WILLIAM : “ Look at ’im! Why, he useter ’are £3000 a year, an' then 'e couldn't make
both ends meet!"
OLD HENRY (gloomily): “I reckon I could 'are tied knots in them ends.”
“Gil Gunnia”: The biggest hatchery of
alligators that I have struck in Australia is the
little-known Archer River, emptying into the
Gulf of Carpentaria on the west flank of Cape
York peninsula. A few miles above the mouth,
where the tidal water mingles with the fresh,
there are miles of mudbanks where the river
spreads out sometimes half a mile. The place is
totally undisturbed except for the few Binghis
who come along in the hatching season looking
for eggs, of which I have seen as many as 120 in
one nest. When Mrs. ’Gator is attending to the
birthrate she scrapes out a hole in the mud, drops
in some rushes and grass, deposits the eggs in a
rough cone-shaped mass, and then covers the
omelette with mud. The mother ’gator
is handy when the young begin to
crawl out, and they follow her, yelp-
ing and whining like a litter of
young pups, while she disgorges food
for them. The Archer River ’gators
are timid, excepting between August
and October, which is the breeding
season; they will then occasionally
show fight. The Binghis in those
parts are experts at capturing them,
and there is a thrill or two in the sport.
Bmghi gets a carcase of wild pig or
cow in an advanced state of “hum,”
and ties it down about half a mile from
the river. The reptiles have a pretty
keen smell, and they are attracted by the
bait. The Binghis wait at a respectful
distance and allow the victim to take his
fill—the more he gorges the easier to catch
him. When they intercept him he makes
a bee line for the river, while the pursuers
jab him in the soft part of the body behind
the forelegs with their arrow-headed spears
and throw sand in his eyes. Sometimes the
beasts escape, but in most cases they become
confused by the sand and loss of blood, and then
are quickly despatched. My experience is that
the Binghis only eat the flesh when other tucker
is scarce.

Wallaroo (S.A.) is plagued with goats.
William (he seems to be mostly William) takes
possession of the mining town at night, aiid is
found roosting on one’s verandah at dawn. “No
ordinary man, ’ said a town councillor passionately
last week, in moving to increase the registration
fee—“no ordinary man could erect afence that
could:keep them out. They would tear down any
ordinary fence, and scale almost any stone wall.”
He had lost two nights’ sleep that week in
getting up to discourage William, and he wanted
the fee raised from ss. to 10s. per annum. Then
somebody asked an obvious question, and it was
found that there are only eight registered goats
in the whole place. So the council decided not to
tax the honest handful, but to impound the sleep-
walking variety instead, “even if they had to put
on the whole of the council’s employees to assist
the ranger.”
“Albatross”: The real hero of the year
thus far has happened at Willaura (Vic.). At
the railway station a fire broke out amongst a
quantity of cornsacks and bags of wheat, which
burned very slowly. The station staff and the
bulk of the population immediately set off in
search of water, leaving the discoverer in charge of
his find. This man was filling-in time trying to
beat out the fire, when a wheat-lumper carrying a
large billycan full of beer transpired. It was a

A bookie came to Boggy Flat—
A Hebrew tall and dark ;
He wore a tall and-spot.ted hat
And owned a rat-faced clerk ;
The'Boggy Flatters stood around
And listened to his roar ;
Upon their rustic racing ground
No “ book ” had been before..
The bookie cursed their ox-eyed stare ;
But still the welkin pealed
The gladsome tidings everywhere—
“ Lav ten-to-one the field ? ”
But ev’ry sport of Boggy Flat —
A place of cows and clods— . .
Seemed fascinated by the hat,
And unallured by odds.
“ Lay ten-to-one th’ blanky field ! ”
The maddened bookie roared ;
“ Lay ten-to-one 1 ” the clerklet squealed.
At last from that dull horde
A whiskered Flatite broke away
On large and cautious feet:
“Look ’ere,” he said, “what will yer lay
To ’arf a bag o’ wheat ? ”

“Maryborough” : Can’tsupport “Pick’s”
entry of the soldier-bird for the friendly bush-
bird stakes. I reckon the soldier is merely
an outrageously noisy fowl, with little to com-
mend him but his occasional insect-eating pro-
pensities. For out-and-out trustfulness and friend-
liness there are two little birds that wear the
championship belt. First is the merry sprite
with the peculiar zig-zag flight, known as the
white-shafted fantail, a sort of half-brother to the
familiar wagtail. To have the long tail of this
little thing whisk the flies off one’s face is by no
means a rarity, and I’ve known one to perch on
the gun of a lout that was trying to shoot it. The
unobtrusive yellow-robin doesn’t come more than
half a beak behind the fantail. T’other day one
of this clan flew in the open window of a sick
room, and perched on the patient’s upraised knee.
Now the two are sworn pals.
THE HEADACHE IN THE MORNING.
A FERVENT PRAYER.
It is a recognised fact amongst

News Item.
DAIRY FARMEN'S SON: “O
Lord, while I ’ave the time,

I wish to thank you, and pray
that very early rising will always
be most armful an’ injurious to all cows.”
“ Minlto ” : I’m spending 2d. to inform
“Minaritchee” and “Gil Gunnia” (B. 5/1/11)
that the gidyea (not “gidya” or “gidgee,” as
westerners call it) is not white ant-resisting.
Either the white ants in Noo South are old-age
pensioners and incapable of earning a living, or
“ Minaritchee” mistook cypress pine for gidyea.
The former is highly impregnated with turpen-
tine, and ants don’t like it, As for the other, a
brother of mine had a gidyea leg, and while out
on the Paroo he was compelled to rub an ounce of
oil of tar into the pores every Saturday night to
stop the ravages of the brutes.

“ Gecko ” : I was the first to ride a green
turtle barebacked across the coral lagoon at Nor’
West Island, Capricorn Group, and so I
speak on the subject with a certain
authority. When mounting, the turtle-
breaker should hurl himself on to the
middle of the carapace, interlocking his
legs round his steed's throat. Should the
animated soup-tureen essay to dive, a
prod under the chin with either great toe
will cause him to desist. The scruff of
the shell should be grasped with the left
hand, and the right employed to shove
the head in the direction it is desired to
travel. Like horses, turtles are apt to
buck, while odd ones, that have been out
to seaweed over-long, or for some other
reasons are fresh and skittish, put up an
awkward wriggle. In either of these
cases, the turtle-man must take a fresh
grip, and, temporarily abandoning the
rudder, seize firmly the right side of the
carapace about midships. Some turtles
rear up on end and flog the water to a
foam with their flippers, with the object
of unnerving their riders. Pay no atten-
tion to this. It is a bluff which deceives
none butt tyros. The turtle couldn’t fall
backwards if he tried. Trim the shell-
ship by leaning well forward, and the
disturbance will quickly cease. To dis-
mount, the rider unlocks his feet, lets go
everything, and falls backwards, leaving
the turtle to glide from under. He stands
no risk of being kicked, since the turtle never
uses his back flippers when swimming, but trails
them inertly behind after the fashion of the
platypus.

“0.K.”: Among the curiosities in sug-
gested names for the hederal capital is Wettin-
burgh. Somebody states that King George’s family
name is Wettin ; therefore the seat of Australian
government ought to be Wettinburgh ! Another
genius protests against the idea of an uncouth
aboriginal name for the capital. Who said that
all the suitable names were uncouth? In the old
language of the blacks of the Castlereagh and
Macquarie River districts “the tongue” was
“ tal'lai,” which is a pretty word. Why not
“ Tallai City”? “Jumbunna,” which is the
Victorian for “ speech,” “ talk,” has
already been applied to a coal town ; but the
Federal Government could confiscate it.
“ K.S.V.” : Two of us were out kangaroo-
shooting lately in the ranges between Texas and
Inglewood (Q.). We were crossing a rocky gully
when, up the bank, we saw two big red-grey
’roos, each about 6ft. from butt of tail to top of
head, fighting with the fury of a tornado. We
were only about 40yds. from them ; so, keeping
still, we had an orchestra-stalls view of the pro-
ceedings. The two ’roos stood up on their hind
legs and shaped at each other like humans.
Straight drives to the body and head were deliv-
ered with marvellous accuracy. First. Johnson
would receive a smack a-side the face that felled
him. and then Jeffries. We could hear the
smashes distinctly. No fault could be found
with the foot-work or dodging, and it looked as
though they had been training. In the fifth or
sixth round things became very lively. Blows
were exchanged about the ears and mouth with
furious rapidity. Hair flew in great quantities.
The next round was mostly in-fighting. Gripping
each other by the ears, they got to work with their
hind legs, and blood streamed from their
paunches. A dexterously-delivered prod to the
ribs brought forth a burst of laughter from the
orchestra stalls—and that ended the fight.
Though I’ve done much’roo-hunting, this was the
first fight I had ever seen ; and I don’t think they
do much of it.

“ Toolooa ” : Are crows wholly useless ?
Not quite ! In Queensland sugar districts, where
cane-grubs play havoc with the roots of cane,
destroying many healthy stools, the black quacks
are entitled to some respect. Day after day, as
many as 20 will follow the plough ; and so eager
are they to get at the grubs that it is quite common
to see them take a back seat on the plough so that
they may have the best chance to catch the early
worm. Instead of depending on the crow, many
farmers, however, prefer the moving fowlhouse,
which is simply the ordinary henhouse with four
wheels and a pair of shafts added to it; but large
enough to hold 100 fowls. The moving theatre is
hauled out to the paddock where ploughing is
being done, and the cackling birds soon become a
busy lot of George Feeds. Later on they bring
good prices as table-birds.

“Culax”: I shove my frame into that
row about the correct method of humping Matilda.
Going out from Southern Gross to Bullfinch yes-
terday, I passed two young chaps with swags up.
One swag was tied in a roll with two pieces of
clothes’ line, the ends of which were then threaded
through the arm-holes of the vest, and tied. The
swag hung limply across the rump, and made an
excellent illustration of the Grecian bend. Novv,
can any Abo. liar tell me in what portion of this
vale of tears that style originated ?
“ Tracker ” gets into bad company :
They fell into the billiard-room and demanded a game,
brokenly explaining that they—hie—wanted to square up
a bit. To show that they really did want to square up a
bir., they immediately ordered whisky.
Bert fastened to a cue all right, but it took five minutes
to get the “jigger ” away from Mack. Speeches followed
about which ball and who’d go first. Eventually Mack
led off with a safe miss into the bottom pocket. Bert
endeavored to capture the hanging electric light to chalk
his stick You could see the Boss trying to work out the
price of a new cloth. Bert got a beautiful all-round in off
the red and then niiscued. Mack swore that Bert had
hidden his ball, and tendered an almost tearful apology
when it was dug out of the pocket.
The only incident of consequence during the next two
minutes was the ordering of more bioscope juice. Bert
negotiated a couple of cannons nicely, and remonstrated
with Mack at length, and some width, for interjecting
“ fluke.” He broke down at seven. He knew he would.
It was his unlucky number.
Play was interrupted by rain, adulterated with more
zoology.
Miss Cues then did most of the scoring until Bert had
a run of five and broke down. He explained it was his
unlucky number. Meantime, Mack challenged the Boss
for £5O on the following evening—£100 if he liked.
An unfinished break of two by Bert was interrupted by
a pronounced tearing. Tbe Boss leaped from his chair
and shrieked as he cleft the smoky atmosphere. Mack
looked up and remarked that he’d take a yard and a half,
please. Bert philosophically zigged to the nearest seat,
and left his cue in the rent. “Three quid ! ” roared the
Boss, with variations. Bert fumbled through his pockets,
murmuring: “Oh, thatsh orlright—mere trifle.” As the
unexplored pockets became fewer the Boss became more
crimson, and he turned his attention to Mack, who was
also searching for hidden wealth. The clean-up was
13s. 5d., a corkscrew, three corks, four bent cigars, a
sandwich, bag of cloves and sundries.
The Boss divorced his senses and called in the Law.
The Law imitated a serious person and interrogated the
cueists. Naturally, Mack imitated an oyster.
“ What’s yer name?” demanded the minion of Bert.
“ Bert,” was the reply'.
“ Bert what? ”
“ No, Bert 1"
The Law warmed up, but it was no go,
“ Where d’ yer live ? ”
“In the shuburbs,” answered Bert, with a gleam of
shrewdness, and struggling to regain his seat.
It was now a dead-beat between the Boss and the Law
for the maddest man. Giving Bert an unladylike shake,
the Force thundered out: “ What are yer ? ”
“ Me ! ” gasped Bert, “ I’m shpot ! ”

“Jimmie Pannikin ” : A few words in reply
to “Elson” and “Giddap,” I have decided to
ignore “A. William-Oann,” because he’s (one)
elusive, and (two) untruthful, and (three) unscru-
pulous as an Outback expert. I did not “ blather”
about Outback hospitality ; I simply paid an elo-
quent but inadequate tribute to the warm-hearted-
ness of the Best Men, the West Men, the Men o’
the Sunset Side; to the spacious, gracious hos-
pitality of the Finest Folk in Australia, the
Further-Out Folk. To “ blather ” is to express
one’s self weakly and insincerely—an act I am in-
capable of. “ Elspn ” can keep his Yankee maga-
zine on “business method.” It’s not worth buying
from him ; and Ido not borrow. I thank “Gid-
dap ” for the horse-sense of his methods. I agree
that the Odor of Afghan is fatal to nearly all
animal and insect life. The camel is impervious
to this awful odor, because his own stench is 78'3
times worse. When the first camel team entered
Mi'lpastinka, the combined effluvia of unwashed
Afghan and calloused camel caused three valuable
horses to drop dead, drove seven others raving
mad, filled the patriarchal billygoats with corrod-
ing envy, and withered all the pot-plants on the
two hotel verandahs. The Stinking Fish smell is
ineffably sweet compared with the O. of A.

THE BEREAVED BARNDOOR: “ What is home

THE CHEERFUL DUCK: “ Dunno —unless it's an

“One Prodigal”: “Vigilans” (B.
5/l/’ll) represents the frilled lizard “as found
only in the Far North.” “ Vigilans ”is wrong.
The frilled lizard may be found in Central
Queensland, round Oharleville, Blackall and
Longreach, and almost as far south as Roma and
Dalby. “ Vigilans ” gives its greatest length as
35 inches. Only a few days ago, near Winton
(North Queensland) I killed one that measured
4ft. lin. When frightened, the reptile presses its
front quarters to the ground and raises its head as
high as possible, at the same time opening its
hideous-looking yellow mouth and expanding its
frill. Little wonder the blacks call it “the
debil-debil ”; for the frill and yellow mouth
combined, when seen in a moment of fear, pre-
sent a Satanic-looking picture. Frill lizards are
found usually in high ridges and frequently are
seen resting on a log fence, on a warm day, in
North and Central Queensland. They can easily
be distinguished from the cocky, who also has a
habit of resting on fences on a warm day.

“T.J.M.” : Brer Fox is bringing his im-
ported cunning right up to date. Lately, I have
found him repeatedly selecting for his home a
hollow log or tree right in the haunts of black
jays. Now, the jays are the best bush watchdogs
living. Their screams on the approach of anyone
are more piercing than the yowl of a Wowser on
finding a couple in the grass. Brer Fox profits
by the warning and fades clear away.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The blazing sun is on my back, and I am warm and wild.
The Browser boils in his own wrath, his words are bare
and bold.
His 9oul is perilled all day long, his rotten luck reviled,
And I could weep with anger while the blessed steel I
hold.
The Out, down here, is furnace-warm, our faces dusty-
grey ;
We toil alone, half-naked, in the still and stifling air ;
Yet I can grin when I recall that dry and dreadful day—
The day I struck the Linedale track with lizards in my
hair.
Above me, panting in the heat, Bill swings eternally
The thundering sledge upon the steel, as slow it grits
and turns;
The hot drill scorches in my palms, and I am sweating
free ;
In my cursing-apparatus a fierce, crackling dryness
burns;
The sharp dust stings our smarting eyes ; the flies, tor-
menting, gay,
Dance devilish figures on our naked skins ; our necks
are seared
In crimson bands above our shirts ; and yet that dread-
ful day
Was worse—the day I struck the Bend with blue ants
in my beard.
For all the thirst and body-sweat I ever may endure,
I never shall forget that time I “perished ” on my own,
And, raving as I wandered, dreamed of far creeks, plung-
ing pure
And crystal-clear through ferny falls and rifts of
marbled stone ;
When writhing monsters mouthed at me with grey, un-
wholesome heads
That mocked and gibbered, muttering “ Y’ never will
get back 1 ”
The time I came out, crawling, with my draggled shirt in
shreds,
While large, white, naked spiders wove green webs
across the track.
But now I’m parboiled in the sun—sure I must drink or
die ;
Our duds flap flaming on our backs as up the Out we
crawl
To where, beneath a bunch of scrub, the frowsy crib-
things lie,
And spell awhile in silence where the shifting shadows
fall.
And yet—although my tongue is parched, the whole
world full of flies,
It’s nothing to the way I felt when, years ago, I found
My carcase on the Linedale track with beetles in my

The day I crawled out, cheering, with my stomach on
the ground 1

THE FEDERAL CAPITAL HOTEL.
Melbourne, Thursday .—Senator Pearce,
speaking at the Rechabite Anniversary
last night, said the Federal Government
was going to start an hotel in the Federal
capital district, but that the place was
not for the disposal of alcoholic drinks,
because none would be sold there.

TOM McKENZIE, MINISTER OF
AGRICULTURE (M.L.).
From an Ancient Mariner :
It is over half a century ago since I belonged to the old
line-o’-hattle ship Victory. She was guard-ship at Ports-
mouth for many years. It was the duty of the “ Jaundy ”
(master-at-arms) to show visitors over the ship, and
Rumor said he was in very comfortable circumstances in
consequence. Special days were set apart for visitors,
whom the Jaundy would first lead to a spot abaft the
quarter-deck hatchway, where he would direct attention
to a round brass plate let into the deck. The plate had
the inscription engraved upon it—“ Here Nelson fell.”
After a sufficient pause he would pass on through the
ship, till at last the party would reach the cockpit. Upon
entering, the Jaundy would reverently raise his cap,
place it topside-down upon the table, and, in a subdued
voice, relate the incidents of the hero’s death, and sorrow-
fully indicate the small brass plate which informed them
—“Here Nelson died.” Thereupon a stout, middle-aged
lady, evidently much affected by what she had witnessed,
and no doubt also impressed by the few solemn and
earnest words of the master-at-arms, would open her
purse, extract a half-crown and gently drop it into
the Jaundy’s cap. This generous and thoughts
action was rarely lost upon the others. But then
they were ignorant of the important fact that
the lady, who set the example, happened to
be the wife of the artful old joker who owned the cap.
As she lingered behind the others once to fasten her shoe,
I saw the master-at-arms stoop down, and heard him
whisper in her ear, “Two-pun-ten.” The lady smiled
sweetly, and was conveyed ashore with the others —to
turn up unfailingly next visiting day.
K. M. Grant, who takes hold of Education
in Bananaland’s new Ministry, entered Parlia-
ment mainlv, in the first instance, on his popu-
larity as a‘footballer. He has remained there
ever since, mainly through the influence of Rock-
hampton’s other member, Kidston. Before he
took to politics, Grant earned his dollar as a
telegraphist.
About the most astounded piece of wreck-
age cast up hv the recent N.S.W. municipal
elections, was G". W. Howe, Redfern’s ex-mavor
and its most ancient municipal institution. He
and his ambrosial whiskers had ornamented the
Redfern council for 27 consecutive years. The
disturbance is regarded, locally, as Labor’s gentle
rebuke to the ancient for his frantic strivings in
the Wade interest, in Botany, at last election.
Deakin has announced the representatives
of the Federal Opposition at the coming Corona-
tion. They are Quick, of Victoria; Senator
Sayers, of Bananaland ; Senator Vardon and
Livingstone, of South Australia; and Fuller,
John Thomson and “Alligator” Johnson from N.S.
Wales. The Bulletin has no complaint to make.
The delegation appears to be thoroughly represen-
tative of Stodge and Podge.
Clayton T. Mason, who has resigned his job
of Chief Harpooner of theSurreptitionsChowin the
Coal Bunker in Westralia. reached N.S.W. in the
early ’7o’s, and toiled for awhile in the “Works.”
Then he shook his leg and became resident
engineer on the Geraldton and Northampton rail-
way —the first line built by the Westralian
Government. Later, he was resident engineer
on the Eastern Railways, and in 18S2 became
a Pooh Bah Commissioner. General Manager and
Maintenance Engineer of Railways, Public Works
Director and a member of the Executive and
Legislative Councils. When W.A. got Respon-
sible Government, Mason became Controller of
Customs, and has been standing up manfully to
the fierce importer and chasing the elusive contra-
band Chink ever since.
The Yellow Pup is an habitually untruth-
ful tyke ; but when it jumps at a false conclusion
and bites the Commonwealth High Court, it is
time to drop the old habit of disregarding its un-
truthfulness, and invite it to an interview with
the Law. At a “Protestant Defence” meeting
at Adelaide one day last week, a Pastor Rankine
mentioned that an R.C. Archbishop was interested
in a will for some £35,000 or £37,000; and when,
the case was before the High Court two Catholic
Judges voted oneway, and two Protestant Judges
the other way, and the Hebrew Judge voted with
the Protestants. And Pastor Rankine wanted to
know what would have happened if the Hebrew-
had been an R.C. As a matter of fact, there is
hut one R.C. Judge on the High Court Bench
(O’Connor). Higgins, whom the tyke no doubt
took to be an R.C., is a Protestant, the son, in-
deed, of a Protestant clergyman. So the whole
horrible imputation against the Court falls with a
sickening thud on top of whatever fragment of
reputation the “pastor” happened to possess.
“ Melb ” among the ghosts and skeletons :
The Como estate of the Armytages, at Toorak, is to he
out up and auctioned-a most appetising gulp. The
fuglemen have got printed a lengthy history of the estate,
artfully dished up, but quite fictitious. Yet there is
Romance hanging about the matter. This is the story :
In the year eighteen hundred and fast asleep the estate
belonged to Hugh Glass. He had made a pile out of the
rag and bone business, from which he advanced to sup-
plying ships with sails, and mending them, in the terrific
period of the gold rush, when 600 ships lay in Hobson’s
Hay. Dying, he left two sons, William and Richard.
The Como estate was part of the concern. William made-
ducks and drakes of the property. He was great at
racing and what not, especially what not. On his
mother’s behalf he sold the Como estate to Octavius
Browne, precursor of the Armytages, who have been
there about 40 years. Browne, a luxurious squatter,
gave £14,000 for the property, and increased its.
value to about £30,000. William Glass broke.
He then went to Clark and Duerdin, Browne’s
solicitors, and told them he had forged his father’s will.
The forgery had been shuffled through probate, even
under the usually-lynx eyes of old Judge Molesworth. It
purported to be witnessed by himself and a stupid old re-
tainer of the family, since dead. William went away to
Hobart. Somehow the confession buzzed all around, for
William made it to others. Chief Police Commissioner
Srandish heard it, and despatched Detective Black,
who arrested William in Hobart. Then ensued
the Glass case—Richard Glass (the beneficiary
under the alleged real will) v. Octavius Browne,
for the possession of Como. Chief Justice Stawrll
tried it. Dawson and Smyth for plaintiff ; Michie and
Fellows for defendant. William Glass went into the wit-
ness box, and deposed straight out to all the circum-
stances of the forgery. Michie, with a tilling speech,
called no evidence in* defence. But, said l.e, might not
William and Richard be in collusion? The upshot was a
settlement. Como was sold, and the proceeds divided
between R. Glass and Browne.
“ Condot ” : Exactly why Edward Wilson,,
of the Melbourne Argus, left his money to charity
instead of to expectant relatives has always been a.
subject of conjecture. Federal Archivist Pethe-
riek, who knew Wilson well, once told me that.
Wilson altered his will after reading “Mr.
Hogarth’s Will,” by Catherine Helen Spence, of
S.A. Others have said the same thing. The’
Statement receives some confirmation from Miss
Spence’s autobiography, published by the S. A.
Register. Of “Mr. Hogarth’s Will ” she says :
The book was to have more effect in unexpected’
quarters than I could imagine. . . . My brother told me
that when he was in England in 1877 Mr. Wilson had told
him that it was seldom that a novel had any influence
over a man’s conduct, hut that reading his sister’s novel
had set him thinking, and had made him alter his
will. He did not think it to the advantage
of his nieces to be made rich, and he would leave
his money to Victoria and Melbourne, where he had
made it. I was the innocent cause of disappointing the
nieces.... But when I see £5OOO a year distributed among
Melbourne charities, and larger gifts for the building of a
new hospital, I cannot help thinking that these are the
results of Mr. Wilson reading “ Mr. Hogarth’s Will,” and
it may be that other trusts are the results of Mr. Wilson’s
action.
A further result is that the terms of Wilson’s will
have provided a sort of pension for ex-editors of
the Argus. The managership of the Wilson
estate falls, in a sort of apostolic succession to
Argus editors. Dave Watterson is the present
manager, and does not seem overworked or under-
paid. The Wilson estate holds the biggest share
in the partnership.

W. H. Els um, who has done some good,
rousing patriotic verse for The Bulletin and
other papers, is publishing a collection. It will
hit the public eye under the title “Australia:
And Other Poems.”
The judgment of James Huneker, the
very well-known American critic, in N’York
Sun :
Frank A. Nanltivell is a young Australian painter.
Too modest bv half, he was persuaded last week to show
a dozen of his recent pictures to an invited public. . . .
Nankivell lias absorbed what is best in Japanese art; the
avoidance of symmetrical monotonous patterns, the way
of seeing nature as a decorative pattern, and the thin,
gay, tender colors. Of the conventional Japanese mo-
tives there is no spoor in his compositions. ... His
portraits are charged with character. .. . He is
neither timid nor a tumbler. He wears his faults on his
•sleeve, they leap to the eye ; but he has a large way of
.recording facts, a larger way of seeing, and, what is rare
among impressionists and so-called realists, a personal
•charm, not overwhelming, but insinuating. It is to be
•felt in his forest interiors, in his portraits, in his delinea-
tion of textures, in that delightful little “Low Tide,” a
lhalf-marine, with its clouds, its blue sky and water, and
iits arabesque made by the bellying sails of the boats.
'We hope some day to encounter Mr. Nankivell’s work in
ithe larger spaces of the picture galleries. He is sure to
ibe admired.
THE AGE LIMIT.
SCHOOL INSPECTOR: "How old, is this child?"
DAIRYMAN : “ Dunno rightly when he was born,
but he come of milkin' age larst spring.”
Harry Graham, the meteoric member of
'the Australian cricket Xl’s which went to England
in 1893 and 1896, died at Dunedin (M.L.) last week,
•aged 40, Harry, who had lately been “ coach of
the Otago Boys’ High School, was a son of
■“Jimmy ” Graham, a fashionable hairdresser and
stage wig-maker of Swanston-street, Melbourne,
where he and John Campbell established them-
selves at the time that Barry Sullivan was lessee of
the Theatre Royal.
“Utiku”: Bulletin (5/1/M1) contains a
par. to the effect that Tallangatta (Vic.) has been
entertaining, unawares, an Austrian Count, in the
person of Antonio De Travers. Years ago, when
I tore a living out of Tallangatta, “Tony ’ was
quite an institution. He was the most nu-
mensely-powerful man in the district and
he loved beer and despised policemen.
Once, when he was having an argument
with the Law, he grabbed two of the
biggest of its minions, tucked one under
each arm, and started up the street with
them, remarking affably: “I take you
two home for my little boy to play wid.
And old hands then used to say that
“ Tony ” was losing his punch.
“Lex”: I see (B. 19/l/’ll) that
Grantham, the English judge, recently
handed one Harris 10 years for felonious
shooting, observing that “this was an
example of the sort of thing that would
prevail under Socialism.” I used to
get much diversion from a consideration
of Grantham and his methods. He is a
strange old man. His loathing of
Socialism is due to the fact that he
was once proceeded against by his
County Council for not conforming to
its building regulations. A strenuous
defence was put up by Gill, K.C., but
he was convicted. On learning the
grim tidings he wept bitterly. Sobbing
is one of his strong suits. He is, by
general consent. England’s champion
male weeper. As he is also deaf, and
so hears nothing of the case that is being
tried, he has evolved a formula for a sum-
ming up. I often sat in his court when
I was in London, and no matter what the
case was he invariably commenced as follows :
Gentlemen of the Jury,—This case is one more in-
stance of the terrible results of drink. I have been say-
ing for years that if young people would only marry
instead of having these promiscuous relationships there
would be far less of this sort of thing. Why go into bars.
Why frequent the unlighted parks by night? Is there
not the Home, or have the inroads of Socialism so devas-
tated that sacred fane that it is not there when wanted .
Where is British fairplay—that proudest jewel in our
Imperial diadem—when political revolutionaries are thus
suffered to outrage and discommode the very matron-
hood it the nation? I’m sure I don’t know what the
country is coining to.
Take him for all in all, this lamentable old jurist
is about as much use to the Anti-Socialist cause,
which he persistently champions, as an attack of
meningitis.
Sheffield, whom the cricket shield is
named after, had a habit of breaking out into
rebellion against the snobs. His team played once
on the Malvern (Vic.) cricket ground; and, as
the result of something that was whispered in his
ear, lie took his lunch along in his pocket. At
the grub adjournment he sat under a tree to eat
it (the lunch, not the pocket, nor the tree),
while the rest of the boys went off to be “climbed ”
after. It was a fairly gay, even a giddy, day for
the cricketers; but Sheffield-with-his-dinner-in-
his-pocket was a sore disappointment to Malvern’s
“ society.”
Henry Brett, who recently gave Auck-
land’s new Town Hall a £6OOO organ, was shipping
reporter on the Maoriland
Herald in Auckland, in
the late ’oo’s and early
’7o’s, at which time George
McO. Reed was the paper’s
leader writer. Though the
Thames goldfield was
booming at the time, the
local Evening News was
wilting. Brett and Reed
came together, decided
that there was an opening
for a smart evening rag,
clubbed their savings, and
started the Star. From
an office partitioned off an
auction mart Reed poured
forth vitriolic articles, while
Brett bossed a gang of
newsboys who made them-
selves heard. The paper
went ahead from the jump.
Its most successful feature
was a red-hot column anent
the social life of the city.
Herein the rowdy “bloods”
of the city were pulverised,
to the intense gratification
of all who were not
“ bloods.” One assailed
aristocrat, hight Walker,
ultimately penetrated to
where Brett sat toiling on
his onion case, and essayed
to thrash him. But Brett
was young, strong and
willing, and one of Walker’s
front teeth was afterwards
interred in a pickle bottle
and proudly exhibited in
the wind ow of the Star for
weeks. About the time the
paper’s success was assured Reed
sold out to Brett; they couldn’t agree
in matters of policy. Reed, by the way,
was the author of that most splendid of canards,
the report of the discovery of the wreck of Noah’s
Ark on the slopes of Ararat. He continued to
write for his bread, and was for some years before
his death on the S. M. Herald.
North Sydney has for its mayor a grand-
son of the man who got an original grant of the
suburb from Governor Brisbane. James Milsom
(the name was spelt like that in the early days)
was on the star-gazing Governor’s staff, and his
service was rewarded with the valuable slice of
harbor-front known as Milson’s Point.

They lounge in ev’ry public park,
Dark blotches on the ragged grass ;
They stroll, with vacant faces, where
The keen-eyed burghers briskly pass ;
Through lane and alley-way they roam,
The men who never may go Home.
Unheeded by the busy crowd,
Which loves and laughs and plots and strives,
As ciphers in the world's great Game,
They live their well-fed, futile lives ;
Like shadows dim they go and come,
The men who never may go Home.
Swindler and sot and wit and fool.
Sponger and youth in silken hose
(Their uniform, their listless eyes)
The regiment of Failures goes ;
Turned pages of Life’s mighty tome,
The men who never may go Home.
Envoi.
King, you have joined that sad brigade
Wherein none struggles any more,
Or swears or cares or is afraid,
Or looks for happiness to come,
The men who never may go Home.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
For the first seven months of the financial year
the N. S. Wales Treasury is £741,311 ahead of the previous
year’s revenue figures, in spite of the fact that £71,511
less was received from the Commonwealth. The railway
receipts were mainly responsible ; there is a gain of
£469,932 on that account, plus £96,694 on account of the
Tramways—total, £566,626. Of course, money was spent
in earning this extra revenue ; nevertheless, there- is a
net gain of £251,336 so far on the whole Treasury- trans-
actions compared with those of the previous year :
Seven
Months. Revenue. Expenditure. Surplus.
1909- .. £7,907,587 £7,515,755 £489,975
1910- .. 8,648,898 8,005,730 741,311
Increase.. £741,311 £489,975 £251,336
The shocking part of the business is that, so far,’in these
seven months, no less than £2,570,181 of Cohen’s money
has been spent, or at the rate of over £4,400,000 a year.
The slump that will happen presently when this borrow-
ing Btops, and the vast employment of labor on new pub-
lic works stops with it, will make the Labor party-
reel, if it happens to have the bad luck to be in
office when the smash comes. In any- case, it is bound to
get the credit for the smash—and by its furious borrow-
ing and frantic disturbance of normal industrial condi-
tions, it will deserve a lot of the brick that will be heaved
at it. No party ever played into the hands of its enemy
more surely than the State Labor party of N.S.W. is
doing to-day.
Queensland has achieved a new Treasurer.
Hawthorn, who was a Kidstonite, has gone out ; and
Philp’s henchmen are now on the Treasury- and other
premises. Philp prefers to personally stand out. He
wants things to go his way ; but he hasn’t much liking
foi -fflee, and it isn’t necessary for him to have office in
oruer to achieve his purpose. Queensland’s seven months’
operations work out as follows :
Revenue. Expenditure. Surplus.
1909- .. £2,805,908 £2,635,167 £167,741
1910- .. 3,178,565 2,706,236 472,329
Increase £372,657 £68,069 £304,588
The State’s pawnbroker advanced £1,007,574. Bpt what
is this with a whole, lovely, glorious £30,000,000 loan
drunk in prospect 1
In Victoria Treasurer Watt has had £773,731
more to handle, railways being mainly responsible. Ex-
penditure and loan figures are unknown. Westralia.
which had been doing a trifle better, had a deficit of
£28,262 for the month, reducing the (mostly- bogus) sur-
plus to £llB,lll. Loan expenditure is unknown. The
State has just rushed through a line to Bullfinch ; and
now plenty of others besides The Bulletin begin to have a
horrible suspicion that Bullfinch is a one-mine field ;
and that won’t make the burden of interest any lighter.
Tasmania has had an aggregate revenue for the seven
months of £639,721, as compared with £555,672 in the
corresponding part of 1909-10; but the increase in this
case isn’t due to a swelling railway- revenue. The railway-
figures sag mainly owing to the two facts that the big
Tasmanian landlord hasn’t been moved yet, and the
Tasmanian mining industry is still pretty sick.

This co. has evidently begun to wonder whether its old
policy of suppression mightn’t have a back-kick in it. The
idea always has been to show comparatively poor profits,
just a few pounds in excess of the dividends. Of course,
nobody- took the figures seriously, because it was
evident that the co. was paying tens of thousands
—if not hundreds of thousands—for new ferries with
profits which never appeared in the accounts at
all. The time may, however, come when either Greater
Sydney or the State may consider the question of taking
over the whole concern ; and then it wouldn’t look nice
to ask a million for a business whose assets were declared
by its own balance-sheet to be worth £250,000 or £300,000.
So the old policy was changed ; and an internal reserve of
£79,410 has been thrown into the accounts, with the re-
sult that the ship property-, which six months ago was
said to be worth £85,386, is now alleged to be worth
£168,630, This new reserve is described as “Reserve for
Depreciation, Public Risk and Contingencies.” How much
has been added to it during the past six months is not dis-
closed. Next half-year the net amount, added will be
visible ; and, as that will be added to the profit, the profit
figures will no doubt jump. The amount of this reserve
is said to be arrived at by revaluing the assets, the differ-
ence between the new and the old valuation being the
amount of the reserve. Considering that the co. owns 26
passenger boats and eight vehicle punts and cargo
steamers, and has made pay-ments on account of two
other steamers, this paper isn’t inclined to charge the co.
with reckless over-valuation. In fact, if the estimate of
value is a fair one, and there are no assets which are not
disclosed, then, instead of the shares being worth 50s.
(20s. paid) and 40s. (10s. paid), the assets represent only-
about 28s. and 18s.
The history of the co. may be briefly put this
way :
1893 Old co. in existence ; capital, £40,000.
1894 Still the old co. ; capital increased to £60,000.
1899—New co. formed ; capital watered to £120,000.
1902—20,000 shares issued at par.
1906 20,000 free shares issued.
1907 40,000 shares at par.
1909 — Authorised capital increased from £200,000 to
£400,000, to allow of more watering.
1910 — 100,000 new shares issued ; 6s. per share paid on
them as a bonus, and 4s. called up in cash.
1911— 10s. more called up on the last issue.
These 1911 calls are payable in April and July ; ostensi-
bly this money (£50,000) is for the new Cremorne service,
for which (as usual) the State has supplied a tramway
feeder.
The paid capital on December 31 was £249,905 ;
:and, even counting the original capital as £60,000 actually
.paid, this is how the sum works out: —
Original capital .. .. .. £60,000
Capital actually-paid .. .. 79,965
Watered capital 110,000
Total £249,965
■On the actually- paid capital of £139,965 the past half-
year’s dividend is tbus at the rate of 22$ per cent.
Whether 22$ per cent, is a fair thing for capital to charge
the public for the supply of a necessary, like communica-
tion between the suburbs and the city, is a matter which
is bound to have the attention of the authorities. The
investor, unless he be infatuated, is also bound to take
this risk into account.

First, as to the amount written off. £5OOO of the total
is put by for an officers’ provident fund ; and though the
co. has given it away, it will no doubt be a good invest-
ment—it will help to attract men to the co.’s service,
and keep the good ones after they have been at-
tracted. The co. suffered a good deal of disturbance
four or five years ago : for one thing, it lost over a quarter
of a million on the ’Frisco’quake ; for another, it absorbed
the M.L. Accident Insurance Co. Each of these events
involved the issue of 25,000 shares paid to £2, though the
conflagration lot were sent out at a premium of about
£l. Previously the paid capital had been *200,000 ;it is
now £300,000. Previously also the co. was “ unlimited ” ;
now the liability is limited to £8 per share. The issue of
the new shares after the ’Frisco shake-up was the right
policy ; for the business has increased so rapidly that the
risks had got ahead of the reserves. This comparison
shows the movement: —

There is a very desirable upward tendency now, due pro-
bably to the co. turning a colder eye on marine risks. At
any rate, a while back the general manager went to
London, and it was understood that he was going to look
particularly into the marine business. Rates in that
department have been horribly cut during the last few
years. No doubt this closer inspection of deep-sea risks
explains why there lias been an actual shrinkage in the
total premium income. The next table shows that and
a few other things :

£620,425, £608,283, £6os,so9—under ordinary circum-
stances this wouldn’t be the sort of movement that share-
holders might feel pleased about. But if it is the result
of dropping ocean business which involved big risks and
.meant little profit at the best of times, there is nothing
to lose sleep over. The crop may be smaller, but that
doesn’t matter if it is only smaller because there are
fewer weeds harvested.
The co.’s investments have changed con-
siderably in the last 10 or 15 years, and the change has
been all for the better :

A list of the public securities is furnished. This paper
confesses cheerfully that it never met some of them
before this co. introduced them. For instance :
Kern County (California) 4$ per cent. Court
House Bonds .. £6lBB
Whittier Union High School District, California,
5 per cent. Bonds .. 4271
San Joaquin County, 5 per cent. Highway Bonds 5455
Still these unknowns are the little ones. And, anyway,
assuming San Joaquin County is a reasonably honest
highwayman, the situation is a lot better than it was in
the days when the co.’s holding of shares in the then very
ricketty-looking N. Z. and River Plate Co. involved a
liability of over £500,000. Even now it is desirable that
the co., instead of lumping its mortgages and shares,
should not only dissever them, but should also set out as
a contingent liability the amount (if any) for which the
co. is liable in respect of uncalled capital on its holding of
shares.
Of the dividend paid for the year, per cent.
(£7500) is called a jubilee bonus. Evidently the directors
thought they must have an excuse for increasing the
bite. The jubilee really happened before the middle of
1909. The co.’s first policy (issued on a paid capital of
about £5OOO, by the way) was dated June 4, 1859. It has
been a very fine half-century’s growth :

-Twenty-five years ago N. S. Wales took no interest in the
Far West of N. S. Wales; more than one Minister said the
best thing that could be done with it was to cut it off
and, so to speak, throw it to the dogs. The whole of it
was represented by two members, who were practically
nominees of a few mostly-Victorian squatters, and the elec-
tion really took place in Scott’s Hotel. Now it happened
that this little group got hold of Broken Hill: W. P. Me
Gregor (long chairman of the co.), Harvey Patterson, Geo.
McCulloch, Bowes Kelly, the Brodribbs and others were
all squatters in those parts. The N.S.W. Government
was as much a State Fright concern then as some of it is
to-day. The idea of building a railway to feed the S.
Australian system was unthinkable. That was a shindy-
kit’s chance. Peter McGregor got himself nominated as
M.L.A. for the district with the one object of putting a
private Bill through. He had no trouble about it; he
said afterwards that, if a man had money enough, he
could get a Bill through authorising the concessionaires
to build a line to the moon. W. P. got his Bill carried ;
and then he promptly retired from politics. (That
was in the days when only patriots were in
Parliament ; there was no demoralising payment
of members then !) The railway consisted of about
30 miles of light rails laid on light sleepers with
the least suspicion of ballast. The co. didn’t own any
rolling stock ; it arranged with the S. A. railways to run
through. The nominal capital was £250,000 ; the amount
the co. actually put up was £46,800. The Broken Hill
mines were amazingly rich. Nearly all the people who
were interested in the mines as directors were largely in-
terested in the tramway ; so there wasn’t any quarrel
when the freight rates were fixed at a price that would
make the ordinary railway man’s mouth water. As a
matter of fact, they made this co.’s stock water. This in
brief has been the history of the amazing concern : —
1886. —Registered ; paid capital, £46,800 plus £16,000 in
promoters’ shares of £5 each.
1888. —First stock watering; £41,860 capitalised (two
shares for every three).
1889. The promoters’ £5 shares turned into five ordinary
£1 shares. Second stock watering, £17,433 (one in
six). Third stock watering, £15,263 (one in eight).
1890 —Fourth stock watering, £27,473 (one in five).
1891.—Fifth stock watering, £32,967 (one in five).
1910.—Sixth stock watering, £52,194 (one in four).
So we get this astonishing result: —
Money actually put up by shareholders £46,800
Promoters’ scoop 16,000
Profits hitherto capitalised .. .. 135,006
Profits to be now capitalised .. .. 52,194
Total £250,000
And all the time that these large amounts of profit were
being capitalised, huge dividends were being paid—fre-
quently as much as 50 per cent, on the watered capital.
Even last year’s £79,122 is at the rate of 170 per cent, on
the capital actually put up by the shareholders, while
the profits amount to no less than 248 per cent.
All the bonuses to shareholders have been in stock,
though, of course, the holders could turn the shares into
money if they chose. For each £1 share (one in four)
which they now get they will probably be able to draw
from £4 to £4 5s. ; so the present bonus is really equal to
over £200,000. At any rate, that will be the amount upon
which Broken Hill and its mining industry will be ex-
pected to pay interest. In plain words, Broken Hill and
its mining industry, having been bled unmercifully, and
having thus filled the co.’s pocket, will now be expected
to pay interest on the capital of which it has itself been
bled. They call this Private Enterprise! Broken Hill
calls it by another name.
But why doesn’t the State step in and stop the
shameful exploitation of a town and an industry ? Well, W.
P. McGregor and his Parliament of unpaid patriots saw to
that. The Act said that, after 21 years, the State might
take over the undertaking by paying on a 21 years’ pur-
chase, based on the average profits of the preceding seven
years. The past seven years’ profits, after allowing for
every sort of depreciation, would probably average
£85,000 or more. Thus, to buy out this concern, the
State would have to put up £1,785,000 —this concern into
which the shareholders put less than £50,000. No wonder
the chairman, at one of the first meetings of the
co., smilingly told the shareholders that their title W'as
practically perpetual.
For some few years to come the co. will con-
tinue to make very large profits. The Broken Hill mining
cos. will be rushing away their accumulated zinc product.
When the present dumps are exhausted traffic will ease
off very considerably ; and probably in 25 years from now,
when most of the Broken Hill mines reach the bottom
that one or two have found already, a train a day may
carry all that Broken Hill has to send to the seaboard.
So, in spite of its glittering past, it is quite pos-
sible to pay too much for this co.’s shares. The
present market value is about £1,050,000. If a man
pays £4 5s. for the new shares he must put away Is. 9d.
a year and accumulate it at compound interest for 25
years to wipe out the capital cost—and it would be most
reckless to calculate upon a longer life than 25 years.
Therefore, before an investor at present prices considers
what interest he is getting he must strike off at least
Is. 9d. per share per annum as a sinking fund.

The half-year’s profits have been charged with £703 spent
on alterations to the bank’s premises ; and that makes
the shrinkage look worse than it really was. Still the
record, so far as ordinary business is concerned, isn’t any
too good. In one respect, however, first-rate progress
was made, no less than £12,351 of profit being shown on
the sale of old properties in hand. These sale profits are
not passed to Profit and Loss, but are transferred to a
special reserve. This is in accordance with an arrange-
ment made at the time of the reconstruction five or six
years ago. Before that reconstruction there were pref. and
ordinary shares; and the latter were permitted to keep
what looked like a nominal interest in the business. In
case things might turn out to be not quite as bad as they
looked, it was, however, arranged that any surpluses
realised above the written-down values should “ accrue
for the benefit of the deferred pref. and ordinary shares
in proportion to the amount respectively paid thereon.”
And this is how the surpluses have accrued :—

Not that the £21,724 of property (book value) got rid of
during the half-year has brought £12,351 more than that
amount. Most of the property is sold on time-payment
principles, and, according to previous announcements,
the profit is not passed to the reserve until the business
is completed. Hence some at least of the past half-
year’s profit was derived from sales made in previous
terms. Hence, also, there is really a reserve behind the
special reserve mentioned above—a reserve consisting
of the profits that will be made if the contracts
are completed. What that contingent reserve amounts
to this paper hasn’t a notion.
This next comparison doesn’t throw very much
light on the matter, though it shows various move-
ments :—

Liquid assets .. 65,010 , 64,087 . 71,621 45,974
It will be seen from this that the book value of pro-
perties and land has been reduced by £176,712 in 5J
years. Probably, however, more than that has been
sold, because other properties may have fallen into the
co.’s hands during- the past 5£ years. On the other hand,
some of these sales have not been completed ; and, not
being completed, the profits have not been added to the.
special reserve. Even if the profit of £52,056 were all that
was to be derived from the whole £176,712 of sales, it
would be a very good showing indeed ; and as properties
which stand at £140,145 still remain to be sold, the
£52,056 is likely to grow to something much larger. In
what manner the deferred pref. and ordinary shares are
to get the benefit of these accrued surpluses isn’t plain.
It doesn’t even appear that the fund is being invested or
kept apart. The capital is £200,002, of which the de-
ferred and ordinary capital is £32,406; the deferred
shares are 5s. and the ordinaries Is. The accrued sur-
pluses bring up the total to £84,462, making the deferred
shares worth about 13s. and the ordinaries about 2s. 8d.

Very soon after the N.S.W. Parliament had hung the
Silverton Tramway Co. around the neck of Broken Hill, it
hung also this water-supply co. True, by this lime there
was a Labor and anti-grab kick in Broken Hill ; so this
co.’s bill had some of its teeth filed down. For in-
stance, instead of having a practically perpetual title, the
concession was given only a 28 years’ life ; at the end of
that time the whole undertaking is to pass to the State
without compensation. Not being a philanthropist, and
the class of work not being(generally speaking) prescribed
in the bond, the co. naturally designed things to last for
28 years and very little longer. Nevertheless, on the
pretext that it was giving away something tremendous,
the co. got and exercised power to charge such a price
for the water on which the silver-zinc-lead mines
and towm wholly depend, that in three recent
years alone the profits were more than the
entire cost of the works. The paid capital was £200,000;
hut no less than £150,000 of this, in addition to divi-
dends, has been returned to the shareholders. The capi-
tal is now therefore £50,000, in 200,000 shares of 5s.; so
the profit for the past six months is at the rate of 120 per
cent, per annum. The co. has now 7£ years more to run ;
and it has already in hand £75,637 of liquid assets (nearly
all cash) in excess of liabilities. Thus, even if it didn’t
get paid anything for its meters, fittings, etc., it could
go out of business to-morrow and return to the share-
holders 7s. 6d. per share. It isn’t likely to do anything
of the sort, though ; it will hang on and squeeze out the
last permissible drop from the people and the industry it
is authorised by Act of Parliament to suck.
What future profits will be it is very hard to
say. Parliament, locking the stable door after the moke
has gone, lately authorised the Umberumberka scheme,
which the Works Department will carry out at a cost of
from £350,000 to £400,000. This supply will not,
however, be available for, say, three years; and
in those three years the co. will suck hard. A very
moderate estimate gives it £40,000 of profit a year =
£120,000 for the three years. This would allow of the
present 30 per cent. divs. on the 5s. shares, and leave
£75,000 to add to the present surplus of £75,637 of liquid
assets = £150,637 = 15s. per share. After the three years
anything may happen. One thing, however, is certain:
the Government scheme will not give Broken Hill cheap
water, if the Department is honest in the matter. In
view of the indisputable fact that Broken Hill is
a wasting proposition, whose life ought most cer-
tainly not to be reckoned beyond 25 years, a large
sinking fund should be provided—at least 2j per cent.
That would mean 0J per cent, for interest and fund on at
least £360,000, or £23,400 per year on top of working ex-
penses. This present concern isn’t therefore likely to be
struck during the last years of its life bv a competitor
able to very severely undercut it. On the other hand,
regulations may be made which, by imposing a rate, may
practically compel the mining cos. to use the State supply.
Therefore anything may happen to the co. after, say,
three years. Quite likely the co. may be left undisturbed
so far as the town supply is concerned ; but it won’t get
fat on that.

The Dividend column is put in just by way of en-
couragement. There is a sort of three-cornered duel
in progress in Sydney and thereabouts, the belliger-
ents being the big Gas Co., the City Council’s electric
light and power works, and this Electric Light
and Power Supply Corporation. The latter co. first of
all got a bill through Parliament on the strength of an
agreement it had made with the Balmain suburban coun-
cil. Later on, it made a 57 years’ agreement with New-
town ; and it seemed to be getting ahead nicely with
some other contracts when the City Council spoiled the
business. To get the extra capital necessary for the
Newtown extension, debentures for £25,000 were issued in
lieu of the shares at first proposed ; and the cost of rais-
ing these debentures, plus interest while the capital
was dead, is chiefly responsible for the £1346 just
now added to the goodwill items. Apparently
the debenture issue was sufficient, for the half-year ended
with the works completed, and only £2846 of liabilities
apart from debentures —an amount which is more than
balanced by stocks and liquid assets. Sooner or later
Greater Sydney is bound to come ; and when the Greater
Sydney’s light andpowef mains trail through the suburbs
in which this co. is now operating, it isn’t likely to do
this co. any good.

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in trans-
mission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Boiler Bearings
save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent, of oil, so one of
the first duties is naturally for engineers to direct their
special attention to these bearings and to car boxes for
trucks. Hyatts are in continuous use in Cement Works,
Ore Dressing Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bush-
ings of flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or

The Bigelow Patent Rock Breaker commends
itself to mine managers who welcome an effective
machine which is cheaper to maintain and repair than
Gyratory and other crushers. This machine is of the
well-known Blake type, but has some additional improve-
ments which have justified in practice all the claims
advanced by the patentee. The work of crushing is done
on the down-stroke of the pitman instead of the up-
stroke ; there is no strain on the pitman cap ; two large
side rods resist the thrust of the toggles, and enable the
j'aws to be regulated within a large range ; the back
toggle is so made as to resist all legitimate strains of
crushing, but will shear under exceptional conditions
and save the machine. The shaft and eccentric bearings
are self-lubricating ; the jaws are convex and concave,
and with the cheek plates are made of steel and are
reversible. The Austral Otis Engineering Company, of
South Melbourne, have installed a great number of these
machines, and hold the sole manufacturing rights for the
Commonwealth.* [3

The addition to the formal Reserve Fund is alleged to
have been made “ to partly restore the withdrawals from
this fund for Dividend and Depreciation during the last
two half-years.” This is really playing with words ; and
one loses patience with tricks of the sort. A fund is
drawn upon to pay a dividend. Then that fund is built
up again out of profit; and the profit which is trans-
ferred to that fund is not reckoned as profit. By pursu-
ing this childlike and bland policy it would be quite
possible for a co. to pay 20 per cent. divs. and never show
any net profits at all. Fair allowance for depreciation is
not, of course, true profit, and is a proper deduction.
But the question is whether the Reserve Fund is
a fund for depreciation at all; it seems much more pro-
bable that depreciation is provided for apart from this
fund. The simplest and most common way is to pay for
new works out of revenue, counting the outlay in with
working expenses. It is almost always impossible to say,
in the case of a N.S.W. co., how much is done in that
way; for the law does not require that any particulars shall
be given. Beside the reserve funds already mentioned
this co. has two others into which it can stuff profits. One is
an officers’ fidelity guarantee fund, which now amounts
to £7OOO ; the other is a new suspense account, to which
£4OOO has been put during the half-year. This last is really
profit, and the £4OOO might—perhaps more correctly—be
added to the half-year’s total. Ostensibly the account
has been created “owing to a readjustment of the periods
of reading the consumers’ meters,” and “in order to
equalise and distribute the earnings over the year.’’
The doubtful point is as to the amount written
off to cover depreciation. If enough is written off apart
from the additions that have been made to visible reserves,
then clearly the net actual profits in excess of dividends
have amounted to £15,559 in the past five years, not-
withstanding that a dividend of £6300 was paid in a term
in which, owing to the coal strike and this co.’s bad
management, a loss of £4225 was disclosed. It is not in-
tended that the public should know much about the co.’s
history; wherever anything may be hidden it is hidden.
But the struggle to stuff away and minimise profits
suggests that the co. is really doing much better
than the directors think it advisable to admit.
No doubt these city and suburban gas cos. are all in
the same boat ; they know that the time is coming
when, to save their lives, they may have to make some
striking concessions ; and they naturally enough want to
work themselves up into so strong a position that they
may be able to make those concessions and yet continue
their present rate of dividend. Indeed, the time for
throwing something to the wolves has already arrived.
So 3d. per 1000 ft. has been lopped off the price of gas, and
ss. off the annual charge for a street lamp.

.Tames Burston, master maltster and ex-Mayor
of Melbourne, proposes that the municipalities shall take
over the tramways, drawing their power from an outside
source. He says that this power can be produced “ more
cheaply than the Government or the municipalities
could provide it,” and cites a rate of £d. per
unit. Burston may be asked (1) Why cannot the
State produce electricity as cheaply as anyone
else? (2) Why cannot the municipalities do ditto?
To admit that the private person can do better is for
every municipal councillor to write himself down as an
inferior, and Burston is one of the number. The City of
Melbourne makes a good profit out of its electric supply
works; yet it beat the monopolistic Gas Co.
down from ss. to 3s. per 1000 i. for gas for
power purposes. And that is only one case. If
the credit of the State or council is good enough
to get the cash to run the works it has in hand, why can’t
one or the other engage successfully in any enterprise
like that Burston has in mind? If, moreover, Burston
saw all this possibility of very cheap power when he was
mayor, why didn’t he point the aldermen to it, and en-
sure to the people the supply of cheap power of which he
talks? Perchance, though, he may be playing a deeper
game. Such a revolution as he predicts may possibly
come from the use of the brown coal deposits of the State.
Burston may want the gentle capitalist to do .the pre-
liminary work. Then when the authority to play pirati-
cal tricks on the public is asked, his idea may be to
shackle up the capitalist, instead of the capitalist shackling
up the public. But if this is the scheme, Burston has
more cunning than he is usually credited with.

Jack Scantlebury writes : “ Having put a year
in on the amalgamation of the old Hawkins’ Hill group,
this is my yap. Hill End was blessed and cursed by a
gold boom in ’7l-2, and will be blessed and cursed with
another this or next year. An old boom is always
cursed—a new one always prayed for. But for this
attempt to revive the field, its phenomenal facts and
figures would have faded from public memory. In '72
Hawkins’ Hill was occupied by 170 cos. and syndicates.
The remarkable gold was confined to 2500 ft. on the line
of reef, and the bulk of it came from about half that dis-
tance, on which there were at least 25 claims, subse-
quently floated into as many cos. havingexcessivecapitals
—the highest £160,000, the aggregate nearly £2,000,000.
In October, ’72, eight claims had a market value in
Sydney of £1,055,000, which worked out at nearly £2OOO
a running foot. The gold production before and after
flotation was upwards of £3,000,000, shareholders in
Krohmann’s getting their money (£80,000) back from the
first crushing. Four hundred-odd tons yielded a ton of
gold. Those in Beyers and Holtermann’s got 75 per cent,
from a 16,0000 z. cake (by the way, cakes were then called
* hemispheres of gold,’ and what are now classed as
‘specimens’ were designated ‘nuggets’). Many share-
holders, as in all booms, got left. The claims were too
small to use the tunnel sites available on each
side of the hill, or to erect their own mills. In ’72
there were 11 public crushing mills. Ebenezer
Vickery had one. It was the custom to clean the
plates every hour, and when a big ‘ clean-up ’ was going
on interested persons stood around with loaded revolvers.
Last week I saw some interested tributors in Bendigo
standing' around a ‘washing-up’ with loaded expecta-
tions. Work from the Consolidated Tunnel during the
last year Ins proved things—that left formations front 10ft.
to 30ft. wide are worth loz. to the ton when the clean
mullock is thrown out, and about 12dwt. when crushed
in bulk ; that the stope mullock fillings are good enough
to crush, and that the reefs on the crown of the ridge to
the east have never been worked. They were beyond the
boundaries of the little claims, and although several
tunnels were started on the eastern side of the hill, not
one reached the ore channel. Yes, Hill End will be
blessed (and cursed) with another boom, in which my
friends, and more particularly myself, will make money.”

A big firm of mining engineers is running the
rule over the Broken Hill South Extended, with a view
to purchase. The rose-colored assays, concerning the
continued publication of which the London shareholders
recently made a vigorous protest, had to be ignored when
a business deal was in the wind. An exhaustive
sampling of the mine has been made, and the future
of the South Extended depends to a great
extent on the result of that sampling. How the mine
will come through the ordeal it is hard to say. But if it
doesn’t get too nasty a hit in the wind the figures will be
made public, and everybody will know all about it.
Financially, the co. is at its last gasp, and the directors
are no doubt waiting anxiously for the latest bulletin con-
cerning the patient’s condition. * #
Only very moderate success has attended the
diamond-drilling in the B. H. Junction North. The
manager is still poking the drill into odd corners in the
hope of starting up ‘‘big game,” but his only reward
so far has been a narrow seam of ore on the
western side of the main lode at the No. 10
level. Below the 1200 ft. level nothing has yet
been found, and hopes in that direction have pretty well
evaporated. The old upper levels are also being explored
in search of a stray bone to relieve the alarming bareness
of the underground cupboard, and a small tonnage of
high-grade sulphides is being won. After several years of
almost continuous construction work, the mine has now
stepped on to a road that should lead to economy. The
power plant has been completed and the mill put into
ship-shape condition. But without the discovery of fresh
ore bodies the life of the mine will be short.

North Kalgurli continues to contribute its mite
towards Kalgoorlie’s gold production. The year just
ended realised £23,554 ; and after working expenses and
tributors’“ cuts ” had been chipped off, £557 remained
to carry forward. About £7OOO was in hand when the
accounts were made up, and profits derived from ore
treatment have since added a few' hundred pounds. As
stated in a recent circular, the directors have taken a
six months’ working option over 72 acres of country at
Yilgarn, and have set apart a maximum of £2OOO for
testing it. 1

Westralia Mount Morgans was finally passed
out on a winding-up order in Perth the other day. There
seemed to be a bit of doubt in Judge McMillan’s mind as
to whether the co., being foreign, and having no regis-
tered attorney on the spot, could be dealt with. How-
ever, he finally decided that it could, and made the order
accordingly. The co.’s Westralian debts amount to over
£20,000, of which £ls,ooois owed to the W.A. Bank. The
principal assets are several holes in the ground, a lot of
machinery and a big pile of residues, some of which are
said to be worth retreatment.

The struggling Sirdar Co. (W.A.) reckons on
making a good living out of the old General Gordon
before long. Numbered among the White Feather
“ boom ” flotations in the middle '9o’s, this property was
soon thrown up, and at the time the Sirdar appeared on
the.scene it was but a gloomy memory of the days when
“ shows ” alleged to be chockful of gold were found to
contain none. Sjnce then sufficient revenue has been
earned to justify the co. hanging on, and during the last
few months several thousand tons of ore reserves and a
small bank balance have been built up. Being now pos-
sessed of a little substance, the co. intends to launch out
a bit with mine development and see what the property
is made of in depth.

Contributing shareholders in the West have
got their knife well into the Marvel Loch directorate.
When tackled at the meeting the directors stated that, if
•all the facts were known, the hullaballoo raised about the
payment of the sixpenny dividend would cease. The fact,
however, remains that the distribution was made at a time
when the mine was urgently in need of new plant, to say
nothing of development, and promoters’ shares got a cut
as well as contributing scrip. To treat both alike, and
then call on holders of contributing shares to fork out for
a complete outfit of machinery as well as development, is
something more than the latter can stand ; and they talk
of first firing out the present controllers, and then insist-
ing on either the issue of new shares to provide additional
'capital or a general reconstruction scheme by which the
“ paid ups” would have to hump some of the burden.

• George Gray has turned up in Southern Cross,
and at latest was arranging to take the Frasers South
(Extended and Day Dawn leases to London. Neither of
these two mines, according to local reports, ever had a
fair chance of showing what they were worth ; and both
are certainly prize packets compared with the tracts of
rubbish that are lying and being lied about around Bull-
finch. One dividend was paid by the Old Frasers South
.Extended on a gold production of 19,000 fine oz. from
14,000-tons treated; but even this lame achievement is
still marvelled at, seeing the hand-to-mouth and other-
wise rotten way in which the concern was run. Want of
funds, heavy water and a fatal accident is said to have
settled the Day Dawn Co., and hurried it into an early
.grave.

The revenue of Brown Hill Extended (W.A.)
for the past year from royalties, etc., just about balances
exes., and the cash balance of £lO,OOO or thereabouts still
remains intact. Some time ago the co. talked about hand-

nothing has been heard of the matter lately.

Westralia Waihi seems to have made a clean
sweep in W.A. The Davyhurst lease and plant has been
sold, the Cheapside North has been got rid of, and the
Northern Star (which nearly everyone was booming when
The Bulletin wasn’t) has been shut down. The co. is
now on the lookout for another mine, and meantime is
clinging to the odd hundred or two pounds that are left
out of its original working capital.

Hampden-Cloncurry (Q.) has located what looks
like a continuation of the ore body worked by its neigh-
bor, the Hampden Consols. The shaft from which this
discovery was made is No. 3, and has sometimes been
called a surface winze. The new ore body, which is of
fair value and easy to smelt, is at a vertical depth of 230 ft.
about 30ft east of the shaft. Levels are being opened
north and south.
* * * *
Hampden (Q.) construction was delayed owing
to the stoppage of traffic on the Cloncurry-Mt. Elliott
line during the floods (Cloncurry had 29 inches of wet ip
three days) ; but all works are again in hand, the smelter
is in position, and a large suction-gas plant and furnace
blower have been installed, together with ore bins and
railway tracks. A sintering plant will follow. Coke will
be coming to hand shortly, and a start should be made at
smelting within the next few weeks. Converter plant
will be erected after smelting commences ; meantime the
matte will be shipped south or converted at Mt. Elliott.
It is also reported that Hampden will smelt for the
McGregor Co. The general manager of Great Aus-
tralia-Cloncurry goes to London early next month to try
to put a bit of life into that concern. Nicholson takes
his place during his absence. At Elliott the costs for
December ran up to somewhere about £3O ; but that was
abnormal owing to the Christmas shut-down. Through
railway bridges getting out of plumb, no trains came for-
ward for two weeks, and postal and telegraphic services
were also badly disorganised. However, there was a good
supply of coke and mine stores on hand, and no great in-
convenience was experienced. The co. must now have
two months’ coke in stock.
* * * *
Annan River Tin, near Cooktown (Q.), is to
make a call of 11s. per share, which will give £3300. The
money is to be used to make the first payment of £2OOO
on an adjoining tin property and provide means to handle
a deposit of decomposed porpnyry. From extensive tests
it seems that a big quantity of the decomposed rock
beneath the original bed of wash contains tin in payable
quantities. Mt. Bischoff (Tas.), which has been working
for 38 years and paid £2,238,600 in dividends, has lived
largely on this class of ore ; so the North Queensland ex-
periment will be very interesting.

Mount Hector (Q.) seems to have died again
In the Mai lease, after cutting the ore-body at 333 ft., a
level was driven west in the ore-body. At I2fc. the miner
was faced with dense magnetite. The crosscut at the
bottom of Monument shaft was continued from 137 ft. to
150 ft., but things didn’t improve much. So exemption
has been asked for, the manager has resigned, and idle-
ness walks about with its hands in its pockets.
The inquiry into the method of working Great
Fitzroy (Q.) ended very tamely. To begin with, there
was no organisation among the dissatisfied men, and they
had no legal representative, though Gent One was, of
course, on hand in the interests of the co. Still, the Board
advises more care in certain stopes, and evidently doesn’t
think much of the method of timbering recently adopted.
The practice of building up sets from the pigsty or bulk-
heads is condemned, and the solid base is mentioned as
the best to start from ; and the square-set system with
close filling is recommended for use where the ground is
bad.
* * * *
New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers, is
cheered up a bit by a make of stone 459 ft. west of the
shaft, and nearly half-way across to Mills’ United. There
is a good deal of talk about deep developments in Mills’
affecting the future of the Freehold ; but Mills’ crushing
(1005 tons for £2254) speaks for itself. A return like that
leaves mighty little profit; and even then it is pretty
generally known that the levels below No. 10 are not sup-
plying the best stone. Still, as the Day Dawn makes
isolated payable shoots, Mills’ United is plunging into the
deeps 150 ft. below No. 14 in the hope of drawing a prize
in the lottery. A similar hope sustains the Freehold, in
spite of the fact that the deep levels have given gloomy
results.
* * # #
The gloom is not lifting from Great Fitzroy
(Q.). January panned out this way: Revenue, taking
electrolytic copper at £57 10s., £8928; expenditure,
£9490 ; loss, £562. Add to that development costs, £606 ;
and capital expenditure, £2975. Of course, the high
costs and the low revenue are excused. But excuses
don’t pay dividends. A big lift in the copper market may
save the co. It is very doubtful whether anything else
can do it.

The British Lion, Gordon (Vic.), as caged in a
Scotch office in Queen-street, has not got to the roaring
stage. It let out a little moan the other day. When
this was gramaphoned in the press it was interpreted to
mean that 200 tons had yielded 15oz. The Scotchmen
will probably put it down to their base desertion of the
Scottish lion rampant; if they had stuck to that, they
might (with the Scot’s luck and hard-fistedness) have hit
upon a decent shoot of gold. The Lord loveth a cheerful
giver ; but there won’t be much left for the kirk plate if
only l£dwt. dirt is broken. *
Ajax, Daylesford, has been wearily pushing
out its crosscut at No. 8 level to test whether there is
gold at depth. The first punch into the reef isn’t very
hopeful, for the wail came forth—“ No gold yet.” This
may mean a lot or a little. What people who buy into
Daylesford have learnt is that the vertical reefs are
usually as poor as most Bullfinch pitches ; but that, when
the flat makes drop in, good gold may be got. The
gamble is in getting the flat makes, just as the gamble is
to get the saddles at Bendigo. Ajax will have to try its
luck driving ; but why should it not do a bit of diamond-
drilling on the way ? #
Naturally Williams’s report on the Waihi
(M.L.) has caused a sensation among shareholders, though
the angriest comment so far has come from the M.L.
Stock Exchanges. Some people want the proposed ex-
penditure on harnessing the Hora Hora Falls for electric
power delayed till the truth is known about the lower
levels; but the Board seems inclined to push on that
money-saving scheme all the more urgently after drawing
this latest blank. Wellington is crying out fora report
by an independent expert, and evidently London has been
thinking the same way, for Captain Richard (Mt.
Morgan’s boss), who is over that way attending
the conference of the Institute of Mining Engi-
neers, has been commissioned to prepare one.
The most serious complaint is that the contents of
Williams’s report leaked out in London. Color is lent to
this by the persistent selling orders from London, most of
the shares being unloaded on the Dominion. The report
was dated Dec. 14 ; so six weeks elapsed before it was
communicated to local shareholders. Rhodes, the M.L.
director, says that on Dec. 12 the London Board cabled
for a special report, and that on Dec. 14 this was “ rushed
through by mail.” Why was the report or a summary
not cabled, seeing its importance? Now, on Dec. 16
the shares stood at £5 16s. ; on Dec. 31 they dropped in
London to £4 12s. 6d. ; and on the eve of publication to
£4 9s. It looks as if something might be cleaned up, or,
at any rate, some reply made to the rumors.
* * * *
Mt. Bischoff (Tas.) came through its half-year
£35,311 to the good, which is a fat profit if calculated on
the mine’s own production of 372 tons metallic tin, an
average of 62 tons per month. On this production,
helped out by the profit made on the purchase and smelt-
ing of tin concentrates, Mt. Bischoff is now able to pay an
increased dividend of 6s. per month (£3600). Every Is.
costs £6OO ; but the increase is tolerably safe with an
output of 62 tons of metal on a booming market.
r * * * *
South Mt. Cameron, Bradshaw’s Creek, arrived
with the Tasmanian dredging craze, and has been more
or less in debt ever since. Water for sluicing is brought
up from the Ringarooma River in a vast pipe ; then, when
the drift is shot down to the Ringarooma, that trickle
banks up so that a lOin. rain is needed to sweep the slum
into the Pacific—or on to the farmers’ flats. Thus clean-
ups at the South Cameron, which would pay well if they
were monthly, are intermittent, and provide only enough
cash to keep a Board, a legal manager and manager Cecil
in their places. Cecil, during his hours of ease, coveted the
Ringarooma and Dorset dredging spooks alongside his
own claim. So, as the plant was going at scrap-iron
prices, the lot has been picked up by the South Mount
Cameron and refloated into the South Cameron Dredging
Co. Here ended the first lesson. In Cecil’s favor, when
the dredges get going, is the high price of tin and the
muddling of all previous tin-dredging in Tassy. More-
over, Cecil has ideas, and is on the spot—which is more
than can be said about the leaders of any of the previous
dredging triers. * * *
The Tasmania, Beaconsfield (Tas.), pins its
faith to the improved prospects at the 1370 ft. level. The
lode has been opened for a total length of 228 ft., but
width and values have been very uneven. For 41ft. the
lode averaged ljoz. for a width of 7ft. It then narrowed,
and 72ft. of driving gave an average of 2ft., with payable
prospects. The estimated average for the whole 228 ft.
is 19£dwt. All they know for certain is that the next
level at 1250 ft. is of much lower grade, so the proved re-
serves above the 1370 ft. level are very limited for a big,
half-million concern. The bulk of the stone crushed
lately has been taken from the lower-grade 1250 ft. level;
for the last 24 days 4255 tons gave £6420 ; for the pre-
vious month, 5070 tons gave £8540, including by-products.
The opening of another deep level will be of immense con-
sequence ; it will almost show whether there is any hope
for the future or not.

Ratcliff, director of the Bairnsdale (Vic.)
School of Mines, has been experimenting with radio-
active material from Olary (S. A.). As a result, it is pro-
bable that a small treatment plant, costing £4OOO, will be
put up to concentrate the irony ore for the infinitesimal
fraction of contained radium bromide, which is the stuff
the doctors use. According to Dr. Mawson, there is also
a deposit of radio-active material in very large quantities
90 miles north-east of Farina (S.A.). In this instance,
the surface is manganiferous ironstone, carrying splashes
of uranium ore. It is possible that further prospecting
will reveal patches of pitch-blend similar in its radio-
active qualities to the ore obtained in Europe. Mawson
is now on his way to England with a parcel of the ore.
Stanley Reward Co. was originally formed to
sluice deep alluvial tin ground on the Stanley River
(Tas.), where the co. holds two 80-acre sections. But this
ground-sluicing has met with a number of difficulties, the
chief being a shortage of water. To overcome this it is
proposed to bring in a head race from the Wilson River,
a distance of 20 miles, which will mean money. The other
string to the bow was found by a party of tributors, who
have prospected what appears to be the capping of a lode
near the contact of the limestone and granite. As dis-
closed by an open cut, there is 20ft. of stanniferous
material that shows lcwt. of tin oxide per cubic yard.
The formation is mainly gossan and kaolin ; but it has so
far only been tested by shallow shafts.

W.S.G.: No balance-sheet yet issued and no
information available W.P.J. : (1) As to the Paper
Mills, don’t know enough about them. (2) Don’t regard
any metal mine as an investment; but it’s one of the
three safest mining risks in Australia.

QUALITY—BUCHANAN WHISKY
“BLACK & WHITE
A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, February 13, 1911.
My Dear Akim,—
“ It broke its teeth along my rail,” wrote Kip-
ling of the storm that tried to wreck his vessel.
On Saturday, just before the Malwa went out, her
rail was half hidden in the flowers of the depart-
ing passengers. It bloomed more florally and ver-
dantly than Aaron’s dry staff, and didn’t look as
if it would break a passenger’s, let alone a hurri-
cane’s, teeth. Amongst the departers were Mrs.
Julius Caro and her daughters Hilda and Renee.
They will go on in the Macedonia at Colombo
after a fortnight’s stay there, and will be
absent a year or so. Mrs. Otto Wunderlich
and her little boy left for Fremantle, where
Dr. Otto Wunderlich will meet them on his way
back from Scandinavian visitings. Mr. and
Mrs. Hugh Denison also left for W.A.
The Gilbert-Lodge pair, from Wahroonga,
departed for an extensive tour. Mr. H. N.
Southwell was on board, bound for Adelaide to
arrange dates, etc., for the Sheffield Choir inva-
sion.
Some Malwa people rang me up this morning
from Melbourne. They had got in before 6
o’clock on this washing day, and nary a soul on
board had been sick. There was a smile on the
face of the waters all the way to the Southern
capital.
Mrs. Dealcin, mother of the lady who, as a
singer, was Miss Josephine Deakin, died last
week at Darlinghurst. She was a daughter of the
head of the clan O’Reilly, whose seat is in county
Leitrim. The ancient Irish title, The O’Reilly,
is still retained by successive heads of the house.
The present chief is the late Mrs. Dealcin’s brother.
Her mother was one of the Marquis of Waterford’s
family. Some of our acclimatised Australian’s
blood is of the real lapis lazuli tint.
Miss Marjorie Edwards, second daughter of the
late Mr. G. B. Edwards, M.H.R., was joyfully
preparing her wedding trousseau at the time of
her father’s sudden death. She was to have mar-
ried next month Mr. Harvey Thompson, a pas-
toralist, of Nappabee, and son of a Sydney solici-
tor. A honeymoon trip to Japan and other Asiatic
ports was to have been Mr. Edwards’s wedding
present to his daughter.
Ihe eldest of the late Mr. Edward Hordern’s
daughters (Florence) died a week or so ago in Lon-
don. I forget her foreign-sounding married name,
but her husband, who is thought highly of by
diplomatics, is secretary to the Swedish Legation.
The lady was a sister of Mrs. “Jack” Sheridan,
Mrs. McElhone, and Dr. Herbert Hordern, of
this city.
In a long, able and analytical article in the
D. T., Mrs. Holman (wife of the Attorney-
General) discusses “ The Passing of the Servant.”
Amongst a host of quotable statements, she says:
People who can afford to employ others talk as though
there were other human beings quite distinct from them,
selves, contumaciously refusing to perform work for
which they were sent into the world. Of course, there is
no such vassaldom. Any girl born in Australia has a
right to choose her own calling—she may elect to be a
doctor, an actress, a lecturer, or to be a cook or a mere
married woman. Few even of those who seem to imply
that there is wholesale defiance of a natural law would
compel the performance of housework. The mother of a
young family who is debarred from evening entertain-
ments is the most genuinely entitled to sympathy of all
sufferers from the present difficulty, but even here there
is neither an individual nor a collection of individuals to
be blamed. In her reasonable moments she knows that
there is no unit of the State who can be expected to say
unless Tolstoism should become the ruling creed, “ I feel
sorry for such women, therefore I will embrace a calling
distasteful to me.” Moreover, one reflection occurs: As
the majority of girls to-day are, through the portals of
the marriage service, joining the ranks of those women
who are tied to their homes for lack of assistance, the lot
cannot be without compensation. I know, however, that
this is a feeble—or a man’s—argument.
Mrs. Holnmn has a word on the Lady Help,
and says most truly that there “is not one family
in a thousand that has a niche for the constant
presence of a stranger—even a very amiable and
useful stranger. Women declare they would
rather wash and scrub for ever than endure it.
Occasionally a girl enters a family where she is
thoroughly at home, but it is a rare chance. Fate
seldom arranges the meeting of affinities.” And
she has a fling at the “social duties ” claim of the
feminine employer:—
“ But it is not that we are too frail to work, or that we
dislike it so much,” is a frequent plea from the comfort-
ably placed; “ but that we have social duties to per-
form. Now, of no one but the wife of a Governor are
social duties in the festal sense really demanded. Le
Monde qui s ctMuse is a very pleasant and not necessarily
worthless one, but no one is bound to enter it. No one
is hurt by another’s failure to attend a social function.
Our dear, beautiful Sydney is calling us all the time to
enjoy. Let us do so, if we will, but don’t let us pretend
to be performing a duty while having a good time.
But the interest with which Mrs. Holman’s first
article has been read is nothing to the eagerness
with which the second is being awaited. “I pro-
pose ” (she says) “ in a further article to suggest
the direction in which I apprehend salvation to
lie.” If she fails she will be like to be torn to
pieces by wild employeresses. That one sentence
has raised hopes as high as Heaven, and that’s an
awful distance from which to be dashed down.
A marriage that occurred lately in this State is
the fulfilment of an old romance and the over-
coming of a succession of boulders that Fate
threw into the pathway of the lovers. The
bridegroom is now 72, the bride 68. When they
were both in the green leaf they were engaged";
but the first boulder was hurled, and they both
married elsewhere. In a few years he became a
widower ; but, as she was not free, he married
again. By-and-bye she was widowed, and in time
married again. She had scarcely taken up her
new life when her old love was bereft of his second
wife. Years passed. A third time he married,
and a few months later his first love was a relict
for the second time. Presently, she also married
for the third time, and for the third time was
widowed. And then, Fate having evidently used
up all the boulders in his quarry, had no more to
throw in their life’s way. Before a fourth stranger
had had time to woo her, the man of long ago was,
by the death of No. 3, enabled to do so. For the first
time in all those years of matrimonial experiment-
ing, they were unshackled at the one time. Hence
the fourth nuptials.
The engagement of Mr. Bertram Ford, a Sydney
architect and grandson of the late Dean Cowper,
to Miss Kellett Baker, the famous tennis player,
is mentioned.
From Wellington (M.L.) trickles a story of the
only daughter of a high official and the ball she
scorned. She is to accompany her parents Coro-
nationwards, and they had listed the people they
intended to ask to an au revoir dance in her
honor. As they declined to have Him (her choice,
not theirs) “amongst those we noticed,” she told
her progenitors to roll the old ball themselves
without her aid or presence, and the cards of in-
vitation fell stillborn from the printing press.
Another item from the capital where life is
just one wet day after another is to the effect that
the engagement of a young citizen of that city to
a daughter of an Australian king of beeves has
been—discontinued. For that matter, one of our
Sydney engagements has been rung off and the
wires cut.
Miss Bertha Brady’s wedding garment is of
deep cream satin embroidered with pearls, and
made by a Melbourne firm in an artistic seizure.
She will not cover her beautiful hair with one of
the new mob-cap effects. A plain net veil wou’t
shroud it to any extinguishing extent. The fair
youngster’s going-away frock is to be a blue and
grey charmeuse and ninon circumstance. As
for her gallant captain, if I knew what
his tie was to be, I might give it, a
line, but I don’t. A man’s tie is the only
item of his attire that interests women. That and
perhaps his socks. The Prowse bridal pair were
to go by-and-bye to China and Japan. Perhaps
the pneumonic plague in those parts will alter
their route. The Powerful arrives to-day from
Hobart.
Mr. W. Asprey, conductor of St. Mary’s
Cathedral choir, but otherwise well known as one
of our best musical authorities, will depart by the
F. Barbarossa in a fortnight’s time. One of his
objectives is the International Congress of Music,
to be held in London. The Asprey concert on
February 22 will be an operatic night. Mem-
bers of all the Catholic choirs are combining to
sing in the choruses.
Cardinal Moran is to be on the passenger list
of the Orsova, which leaves on March 1 for
West Australia.
Mrs. Claude McKay left with her small child
by the (Somerset, last week, for homeward English
ports.
Mrs. T. H. Kelly is on her way back to Aus-
tralia, having had a thrilling time among the
potentates of India. At the Viceroy’s Cup meet-
ing she was acclaimed by the local papers as
among the most delightful-looking persons present.
Mrs. Ernest Watt is about Sydney, quietly
frocked in something reminiscent of half mourn-
ing for the late King. She has brought her
distracting, prize-doll prettiness back unimpaired.
In her latest book of reminiscences, “Under
Five Reigns,” Lady Dorothy Nevill writes of a
palace at Florence occupied by her family in the
earlier half of last century. The palace entrance
opened upon a mean and dirty street, smelling as
only an Italian street can ; but once through the
gates there was a wondrous change. Acres of
garden terraces, grottoes and park-like grounds
surrounded the palace, with an outlook upon the
snow-clad Appenines in the distance, and the
whole description might fit a corner in fairyland.
Their landlord, the Marquis Torregiani—
Was above 80 years old. Tall, thin, and perfectly erect,
he was to be seen early every morning walking among the
groves of his own planting sheltered by a green silk paro-
sol. Local rumor said that in his youth he had loved a
country girl, but pride prevented a marriage. She died :
and her noble lover built in his grounds "a lofty tower,
from the battlements of which he could see the distant
village, doubly interesting to him as containing her home
and her grave.
The present Marquis is of interest to Australians
in view of the fact that a couple of years ago Miss
Clarissa Fiaschi, daughter of surgeon Fiaschi, of
Sydney, became his Marchesa. She took him a
considerable dower left her by the father of her
deceased fiance, a Mumm of champagne fame.
Mr. Norman Lindsay’s friends are wondering
what he has done with the tall silk hat he didn’t
wear in London. Soon after his arrival in that
capital he attended the “ Sunday afternoon ” of a
noted publisher. He was the only man in the
gathering in a sac suit. The solecism didn’t eirf-
barrass him in the least; but on the principle that
it is well when in Rome to roam wid ’em, ,he got
the whole conventional box of tricks—-tall
hat, tail coat, white waistcoat-slip, and -grey
pants. But, although he paid many calls
and attended more noted publishers’ afternoons,
he never once wore the beastly hat. His plan was
to get furtively and secretly into a taxi, put the
hat on the seat opposite, slip furtively. out at his
journey’s end, carry the nightmare into his,host’s
house, and leave it on the hall table. That'hat
was never really wanted on the voyages," and it was
always standing on its own head,. not on the
artist’s. The top-hat of the Briton Norman
Lindsay considers to be Britain’s real Defender of
the Faith.
Another, yea, apd a third aspect of his s.tay' in
England puzzled the artist. He rpnted a resi-
dential studio at Hampstead for £6O a year, but
lost count of how much more he paid in rates. It
seemed to him that a man with a notebook, pencil
and a slip of white or blue paper called
on him every day for a rate or a tax.
He paid all but the dog tax, for he was
certain he hadn’t a. dbg. , The poorhouse rate and
the tax for the prevention of grass in the streets
seemed feasible enough. The great third wave
that swept over the artist was made up of the
prices and quantities of the groceries he consumed.
At any rate, the groceries his landlady said he
consumed. Just how many of. the taxes and the
groceries were bogus he doesn’t know to this day.
Concerning that beautiful Sydney .girl, Mi?s
Constance Simpson (Connie Corona), who left
here a while ago to try the London stage. She
was appearing (when the mail left London) in the
Theatre Royal, Hanley, as the:Fairy Godmother
in “Cinderella.” A press notice says of Jier:
“Miss Corona has a handsome and graceful pre-
sence and a beautiful voice, and wears a lovely
costume. In this preliminary scene, she sings
‘Slumber, dear children,’ and at once gained the
favor of the audience. Miss Corona will be an
artistic favorite this pantomime season.”
A this-sider who lately went across to Maori-
land to soak out some troubles at Rotorua, sends
a mournful note concerning the much-advertised
bathing place where you drink “Rachels” to
atone for your youthful sins. A wing has been
missing from the sanatorium all along, making
the premises look like a pig with an ampu-
tated ear ; now, instead of supplying the miss-
ing ear, an addition has been made which doesn’t
harmonise with anything, and gives the visitor
eyeache to add to his other ills. And the plaster
falls off, and the paint peels off, and if you
searched all the world you couldn’t find a worse
bowling green, and everything wants shaking up.
The visitor, who loves Rotorua, implores Premier
Ward to send along his Minister for Grace and
Elegance, and have things seen to at once.
Never has the mosquito been so numerous
“amongst those present” as it is now. A
Mosman resident tells me that she has had to put
her mosquito nets into commission for the first
time in nine years. Another who took a big
bottle of citronella with her to Java and Singa-
pore, and brought it back unopened because she
had no use for it, has now used up the lot. Immi-
grants who take work in the country are particu-
larly bitter about the mosquitoes as they call them.
The unusual summer rains we have had are the
cause of the enormous increase in the insect
birth-rate.
I never thought the Elizabethan ruff, or the
Toby or hair frill,- would really suit any person
until I saw Mrs. Hugh Ward wearing one in the
Pierrot group, on the stage of the Palace
Theatre, last Saturday afternoon. The matinee
was in aid of the St. Vincent’s Hospital, and
the ladies working for it are highly grati-
fied at the result. As they sowed well so
did they reap. Over £250 was safely Chubbed
before a very red sun sank to rest. The Misses
Austin were the principal laborers in this charity
vineyard. Mrs. John Toohey, who was president
of the coriimittee, was early on the scene, and held
an impromptu and hurried reception in the vesti-
bule of the theatre before going into her box. The
Harry Austins had another box, and Mr. and
Mrs. Frank McDonald (she was one of the
vast McPhillamy clan) were “skied” in a
third. Mrs. Hugh Ward, after her songs, went
into her box to join one of her little boys
and Grace Palotta and the blue dragon that was
embroidered on Miss Grace’s frock. Mr. Arthur
Allen was in the stalls with two Lamb sisters-in-
law. Colonel Lassetter, with actor Leslie
Holland and others, was in the circle. After
seeing the show ' fairly started, Mr. Ward
hurried off to the Rose Bay Baths to see his eldest
small boy make his debut as a contestant swimmer.
Mr. Syd Price’s work at the matinee was capital ;
so was Miss Aggie Thorne’s and Miss H. Foldi’s.
They are telling a story here which is “up
against” a couple of A.D.C.’s. Being in Manly
and bored, they leapt at the suggestion of an
acquaintance that they should visit the yacht of a
friend of his. Arrived on board, they drank the
yacht-owner’s whisky and hearkened to his well-
meaning but dull prattle as though it were allur-
ing conversational goods. The time came when
they decided to depart. The yacht’s dingey was
requisitioned, and the vice-regalities dropped into
her and were rowed shorewards. Then did
they begin a free and frank criticism of their
host’s manners, social class and so forth—in
French. Confident that a mere dingey-rower was
unacquainted with the Gallic tongue, they roundly
denounced him who had slaked their thirst
in the hour of need, as a hopeless bourgeois, and
a flagrant member of the lower-middle classes.
When the boatman got back he told the yacht-
owner, with meticulous precision, every word that
the Government-housers had uttered. For lo !he
chanced to be a Frenchman.
A lately-returned tripper tells about a London
fruit-shop. She eyed the peaches and grapes,
and, though she had seen them labelled with
fabulous figures, she decided that, anyway, she
must at least sample the goods before she came
back home again. So she sailed in. Peaches?
Yes, 6s. each; 355. the half-dozen. Grapes?
Half a crown a pound—and very cheap. So she
would have some grapes. And the peaches ? No,
she thought not—not at 6s. each. “Oh, well,”
said the Duke behind the stall, “I’ve got a bad
one, and you can have it for eighteenpence ! ”
Flautist Lemmone is the sleeker for his Cana-
dian tour with Melba. All sorts of money were
made by the venture, and Mr. Freddie Shipman
and his clever little wife (she worked hard in a
secretarial way, Lemmone says) are wearing out-
size smiles as a consequence. Shipman will take
Nordica overmuch the same route, starting in
teinber. At Milan Lemmone went to hear “Lohen-
grin.” None of the audience was in evening dress ;
but every unit of it knew every note of the music:
The show started at, 8.30, and.at half an hour after
midnight the flautist sprinted to catch a train.
The musical air is becoming heavily charged
with the microbe of the Sheffield Choir. At its
own home it is evidently a remarkable and
rather Socialistic collection of ' men and
women of Sheffield. Wealthy manufacturers
sit alongside their factory hands at the
weekly practices, and such is the quality of these
Yorkshire musical dumplings that theyarecredited
with this quantity of sfiill: “ There is not a singer
amongstthem whoisunabletoread atsigfit themost
difficult choral, music ever written.” They have
Dr. Coward as conductor, and he is a martinet of
high degree. When singing “He Trusted in God,”
from “The Messiah,” the order is “Whoever
looks pleasant now will be fined.” The conductor
shows his teeth ; the choir must snarl. When
singing pianissimo passages at practice, this
general conducts with his chronometer in his
hand, and when he cannot hear the machine tick
the chorus has to repeat the singing. The person-
ality of the choir is enhanced by the promoter of

able' energy. Sydney is expected to have its
upheaval in June next.
Since the heroic deeds of Messrs, darken and
Baker brought the dramatic possibilities of surfing
into prominence there has broken out a craze on
the part of young females to be rescued from
the ocean, On any warm day these times—
so constant surfers tell me—you may ob-
serve, callow maidens, who have nothing wrong
"with them save a hankering for notoriety', utter
shrieks of bogus terror and fling their arms wildly
aloft. This is the signal for a rush .of
life-savers, who tear the shrieker from
the water and bear her seemingly-inanimate
body to a dressing shed. For the moment, a
limp, bedraggled form, closed eyes and gasps.
suggestive of impending dissolution, are more
fashionable than “Miss Gibbs” hats.
That large avoirdupoisy young Cooma man
Mr. Charlie Coleman, who played with Julius
Knight companies here, is appearing in “The
Waltz Dream ”at Daly’s Theatre in London. He
is Herr Krautz. The Franzi of the production is
Miss Lily Elsie.
When Mosman gets glad about the return of
a resident that it likes it welcomes the re-
turned under a full moon, with speeches,
music, song and food. It puts its male
persons into evening clothes, and its feminine
persons into restaurant gowns. A certain area of
pearly shoulder is denuded, and model hats are
posed on undulated tresses. Last Saturday
night the Mosman Recreation Club wel-
comed the return of Mr. Alec Thomson and
his wife from a holiday trip to Colombo. The
club welcomed the home-comers under the fore-
going circumstances, and all went merry as a
waltz tune.
Mrs. Deerv, of Rockwall Crescent, asks me to
acknowledge the receipt of £5, sent by a kindly
soul for the Hospice charity.
They talk (and by “they” I mean proud, intol-
erant male persons) of the vanity of women.
But I oftentimes think that, on the face of him.
the modern He can give the allegedly weaker sex
points and a beating. I am not thinking of the
male’s passion for gaudy socks, rimless hats and
wild-hued ties, but of other manifestations of
his self-esteem. For example, on Sunday I
picked up a paper and saw that a couple
of estate agents had seaside property for sale.
They gave no photographs of the property, but
their own visages were presented, with names at-
tached. One notices the same tendency in cer-
tain money-lenders, haberdashers and so forth.-
Wherefore? The goods are* rendered none
the more alluring thereby. Demonstrably the
fact that J. Bill Smith wears a tall collar and an
ingratiating smirk when he has his picture done
is not calculated, of itself, to attract a single
customer of sound intellect to his wares.
I accordingly diagnose that Alaric Bodger,
Esq., and the rest of them go to
the expense of publishing their portraits
out of sheer vanity. There is only one business-
man whose counterfeit presentment it is desirable
to have about one so long as business is
doing--I mean the bookmaker. One reason
is that the customer is thereby given some-
thing to go on, when he or she starts
round the ring in the hunt for his or her winnings.
In such circumstances there is nothing so com-
forting as the grim face on the card of the Isaac
who has laid the wager. And in the event of
the worst befalling, there is some solace to be
gained by handing the levanting villain’s likeness
to the nearest Robert.
Miss Fitzmaurice Gill, who is a grande dame in
“Miss Gibbs,” is publishing this week a sona
(from Nicholson’s) called, “I Wait for Thee.”
Words and music both are by the clever Fitz-
Gill.

IF you could gather at your home the leading artists in each
branch of entertainment, from all parts of the world, wouldn't
you welcome the opportunity of hearing each of them in the
turns which have won them universal fame ? Such an event could
not fail to win your appreciation.
To bring together in person, at one place, such a gathering of
talent is, however, impossible. The expense of the proposition
would put the project beyond fulfilment, and, not only that, but
the very artists you would wish to reach would be probably too
busy to come.
There is a way to enjoy the efforts of these, people, and that
way is to purchase an Edison Phonograph. It makes available to
all, at a small cost, the best of entertainment. Its rendition is clear,
sweet, pure - and true, unmistakably different to the ordinary
talking machine.
Hear the Edison Phonograph at the nearest dealer’s to-day.
There is one quite handy to you. If you do not know his address,
write us and we will supply it, and also send latest lists of machines

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 13, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The forthcoming Governor of Victoria—Sir
John Fleetwood Fuller—is the sort of Englishman
who should be imported to Australia as an emi-
grant, and placed upon the land with sufficient
inducement to stay there. He has eight children
and a wife; and, as the eldest of the brood is not
more than 15, he may hope to take an even larger
family out of the country than he brings into it.
Naturally Lady Fuller is of the quiet domesticated
order ; and she is pretty certain to live as much
as possible at the Macedon home for the bairns’
sake. Eight, if you please—and six of them not
yet in their teens !
The Carmichael aides are preparing to be dis-
persed. Captain Garcia, the tall and dark orna-
ment of the vice-regal household,, will return to
S’Africa to put in the two years of military ser-
vice which were stuck up to his account when he
left for Australia.
The A.D.C. who approaches with the new
Governor is named Awdry—Majah Awdry. If his
hat is as splendid as his name, it should flash like
a coon’s smile. An A.D.C. is known by the
miraculous shine of his high silk hat. I have a
theory that the secret of the hatter’s nimbus is kept
strictly for Gentleman Helps. No matter how
dusty the day or how far the journey, the stove-
pipe of the A.D.C. retains its unearthly glitter.
Once a gubernatorial touring motor broke down
in a remote, frog-haunted wilderness. An im-
portant engagement had to be kept. Several
dazzling Hats conferred wildly and agreed that
all was lost. Then a railway engine was detected
tearing along a streak of lonely railway line not
half a mile away. Two excited A.D.C.’s
bolted across paddocks and pantingly waved
two superfine handkerchiefs. The tender of
the engine was covered with homing plate-
layers, clinging on anyhow. However, the
iron caravan—which happened to be going
that way—condescended to give the worried
Governor and his perspiring helps a lift to the
country city of his appointment. The Governor
sat on the coal or somewhere; but the A.D.C.’shad
to hang on to the outermost rails of the tender.
It is on record that despite smuts the hats still
shone like stars at the speeches later on.
Private Secretary Victor Hood, after a busy
time with Governor Carmichael, has obtained
leave for a couple of months, and is off to Maori-
land with a fishing rod.
What a giddy time is to be the portion of the
Parliamentarians going to England for the “ fes-
tivities. ’ The latest news is that the Common-
wealth representatives have been invited to visit
Harrowby, the earl, at his little place in the
country. “The programme submitted by Lord
Harrowby,” according to the Prime Minister,
“ includes civic receptions at Stafford and Stoke,
a visit to the famous Stoke potteries, and attend-
ance at divine service in the Lichfield Cathedral.”
What a time !
Premier Murray takes his eldest chick, Doris,
to London to see the Coronation procession and
the incidental fireworks and things, whilst Mrs.
Murray stays at home to look after her younger
girleens, Heather and Jean.
John, of Warrnambool, is proud of his threesome.
Doris is a tall, handsome girl with a glory of Titian
hair and fine figure. Besides, she has a good in-
tellectual equipment and holds a certificate as
chemist. She is, or was, dispenser at the Queen
Victoria Hospital for some year or two.
Staniforth Smith’s old political and other pals
begin to be anxious about him, in spite of the
assurance of Port Moresby officials that, nothing
is likely to have gone wrong. A Lieut.-Governor
or Administrator in Papua has to do all sorts of
jobs—or does them if he is the sort of ener-
getic man that the big, bronzed S. Smith is.
Haying heard vague things about coal de-
posits in the little-explored Flv River country,
he made about as much preparation for the jour-
ney as mother might if the family were going
down for a picnic to Sorrento, and set out. He
should have been back over a month ago; and,
though things may be all’right, that other fine
Australian—lawyer and bushman too—Judge
Charley Herbert, has gone to Thursday Island to
pick up a couple of launches and send them out
searching.
Last Friday and Saturday dragged by without
a trace of Test cricket. Out in the centre of a
sodden ground the carefully-prepared wicket grew
gradually more and more hopeless, while in town
a group of cricketers glowered at drenched way-
farers from the shelter of their hotel. Parties of
girl enthusiasts reviled the weather to one another
over miles of dripping telephone wires and hoped
for a break ; but there was no break—the rain
just kept on falling. A sea captain just
arrived in Port Phillip from the North says that
he has not seen the sun for 16 days. That’s what
you get when you travel down from Queensland
in company with a monsoonal depression, or what-
ever the wretched thing is called.
On account of the unmerciful weather, the Kew
Canoe Carnival was postponed for a week. Large
cards to that effect were hung in various parts of
the city, when it was seen that the clouds would
not roll by. The committee is furiously hoping
for a warm blue day on the 18th ; it reckons it de-
serves that much if ever a committee did.
The deluge of the past week sent seasiders
scurrying home like half-drowned rats ; and now
that they are all under roofs again Mr. Hunt is
switching on holiday weather. The usual fish
stories are being told by the men folk. The tallest
comes from Dr. W. R. Boyd, who solemnly asserts
that the catching of about 200 mullet at Lome
was due to his Pied-Piper powers as a whistler.
He whistled, and the fish simply fought to get on
the hooks.
The Frank Gavan Duffys return from a luxuri-
ous jaunt abroad. They have been seeing lots of
Europe, and have been sampling the weather in
various cities. In Rome, which they have re-
cently left, they found some beautiful mornings
and a near relation. The latter is Guy Gavan
Duffy, a Frenchified priest, and the particular
pride of his barrister pa. He is being educated
in the College of St. Sulpice, and, after a theo-
logical course, will labor for the Church in the
city of Melbourne. The young man, by the way,
was ordained in Switzerland.
Mrs. Tom Hogan, in deep mourning, is off to
London in about a month’s time, leaving her hus-
band to look after the Balwyn miniature model
farm in the intervals of law work. Her becoming
black garb is for a beloved brother who was badly
hurt whilst motoring, and died after months of
pain. She is taking a sorrowing mother away
with her from sad associations.
Mrs. Philip Morton, one of Sydney’s prettiest
women and smartest dressers, has sprung the
domestic surprise of 1911 on her friends. On
Monday night she achieved a girl infant of great
beauty and considerable lung power. This makes
a shamrock of girls to the Philip Morton
pair; but the . third petal is 16 years smaller
than the preceding one. The smart-setter
mother gave dinner parties and otherwise enter-
tained, and a Sydney daily of last week men-
tioned her almost immediate departure for
Europe. The nurse who was selected to attend
her sailed under sealed orders, so to speak. She
did not know to whom she was consigned until
the physician steered her there on the day of the
event. Mrs. Morton is a Maorilander, and was
one of the Hay girls of Coolangatta, step-sisters
of the late Dr. John Hay, of Crows’ Nest, North
Sydney, and of the Berry estate.
Many stories are told concerning the handsome
exile from “ Home,” who figured prominently a
while ago in the best Australian restaurant circles,
and subsequently ran a suburban domicile under
distinguished patronage. It is said that his most
notorious exploit in England happened under the
roof of a hostess who has lately been travelling
hereabouts. Also, it is said that his Australian
adventures include a hand to fist encounter with
a high-born relative, arising out of a protest
against his own particular methods of meeting his
liabilities.
Talking of up-to-date dressers being mobbed in
the street, somebody suggests that theatrical
managers will yet have to screen the circle and
stalls before the curtain rises. A gallery
audience these times does the next worst thing to
mobbing a woman who introduces a novelty to
notice. The other Saturday night, at the Royal,
when the gods and goddesses were waiting for
“ The Gay Grisette ” to begin, they gave a discon-
certing “ reception ” to Mrs. Fred McEvoy on ac-
count, apparently, of her' smart bandana head-
dress, with osprey plumes. The McEvoys had
bogked two stalls in the front row, right in the line
off gallery fire, and as they passed to their
seats, the head-dress drew a volley from the girls
and boys on high. There was nothing in it to call
for excited remark from anyone except, perhaps,
the person who sat immediately behind it, yet
the deities guffawed. Such incidents are becom-
ing quite common at the theatres. A spirit of
boisterous ridicule is distilled from any uncommon
object that comes along, but headgear seems to
be the first consideration. Melbourne “block”
loungers started the craze by guying and hustling
a tall “ Arcadian ” show-girl who wore her Chanti-
cleer hat in Collins-street one Saturday morning.
People predicted that when a wealthy divorce
made his re-appearance after a long absence, he
would be socially cold-shouldered, although his
present wife had nothing to do with the case.
The prophets have been put to confusion, for some
of the shoulders that were expected to be coldest
are now in friendly contact with the returned
wanderer, and the dead past has received Chris-
tian burial.
“ Buffalo in the clouds” is the bait thrown into
the advertisements of a wily Tourist Bureau for
the Chalet on the rocky heights. But the Noahs
and Noahesses who braved Buffalo in the recent
rains found the clouds anything but desirable.
The Chalet has been built of wood from the sur-
rounding forest, but with a profound disregard for
seasoning ; so the latest party I’ve heard from
slept under umbrellas with a fine shower
teaming through the warps in the green-
wood roof. Mrs. Masseran and Mrs. Gay
took a party of French visitors up to
set a sensible example to the huddled houseful of
holiday-makers. Being experienced in Alpine
discomforts, they dressed the part suitably, and,
clad in brief skirts, had some fine climbing. At a
final Excelsior chaos of boulders, the party shed
even the abbreviated skirts, and climbed in
clothes that would have delighted the heart of
Mrs. Bloomer. They reached the summit tri-
umphantly, gloated over wonderful views, and
then tramped down, gathering up the discarded
garments on the way. If the raw Chalet
had only afforded them dry beds, the people of
the party say they Would have forgotten they
were mountaineering at all.
Mrs. Masseran darts over to Sydney for a week-
end, just to cast the keen eye of a .general over
Sassiety’s figure before it gowns itself for the
Easter races. What’s the good of beaded ninons,
fur-trimmed, if women are not made the right
shape first ? A leopard may not change its spots,
but the fashionable woman is no leopard.
Mrs. Watkinson and pretty daughter Ailsa
(who has just put up her fair Marguerite plaits),
depart on the Barbarossa for a holiday. There
was a huge farewell party at the Turn Verein,
which is now located in Victoria Parade,
having bought the ancient grey house of the
Grices, with its desirable lawns and shrubberies.
The club possesses two excellent libraries—one of
German literature, and the other of English.
There are rooms for athletics, as well as a newly-
built ballroom, with an orchestra gallery arid
a stage. At this send-off party there was dancing.
A heartless gardener had left sprinklers going here
and there ; but there were terraces and winding
shrubbery walks for the idlers—or pretended
idlers. Directors Mr. Riley and Mr. Mcßeath
made farewell speeches, and Di Gilio’s band sup-
plied all the music from “He’s a Jolly Good
Fellow ” to the necessary waltzes and two-steps.
With shoals of people leaving for the Coronation,
it is quite nice to hear of someone coming home
to Australia. The Carlyle Smythes are boarding
the Grosser Kurfiirst shortly, at Southampton;
they expect to get back to Melbourne in March.
Miss Anne Margaret Cecilia Miller was wedded
to Frederick Henry Travers-Ball, on February 7,
in St. Pat’s Cathedral on Eastern Hill. Both
bride and bridegroom belong to families that have
helped to make Haw-Hawthorn and Kew the
tony suburbs they are. After the wedding the
party went down the street to the Grand for a 12-
course “breakfast,” which was decked out in
white and silver like a fairy tale. The menu
cards were small poems in silver and white, with
the stipendiary lion of the tall pub waltzing on
the cover. Some of the Australian Test Matchers,
who had just arrived and were waiting in the
lounge till their luggage was sorted, joined cheer-
fully in the “Jolly Good Fellow” chorus by the
breakfasters, and helped to make the honey-
mooners’ send-off a very hearty one.
Tourist-General Boyce is having an American
party of world inspectors passed along to him by
Raymond Whitcombe, the Cook of U.S.A. The
party is now approaching these shores. Besides
Australia, their tour takes in Africa, Maoriland
and the South Sea Islands. Their itinerary book
is illustrated with many photographs of the
Islands; but this continent is a bare outline of
dates and places. “They’ll know more about it
before they get back,” says Boyce gaily. The
leader of the band of wanderers is Captain Akin-
Higgins, which sounds English. However, the
list also includes a Mrs. Bigelow, which has a
strong American flavor. J. Wurrn, jun., is
another interesting label.
Here is a man-millinery item. Barrister Barnett
sought to make an application at Melbourne
General Sessions last Thursday before Acting-
Judge Neighbour. Unfortunately he was with-
out the conventional black kimono and horsehair
hat, and the Acting-Judge noticed the disgraceful
fact. “Practitioners in Melbourne,” said the
Acting-Judge, “ should be more particular. The
practice of robing has existed for centuries and
must be observed.” This telling argument greatly
impressed the Court, and someone was heard to
remark that it was high time the Law Courts
possessed a wardrobe lady and a stage manager—
especially when it’s an acting Judge that’s on the
premises. A till-death-us-do-part Judge isn’t apt
to be so particular.
The other night, at one of the Melbourne
theatres, a nice plush seat was occupied by a
small, snoring pug. Next door sat a female with
a large box of chocolates. She petted the bored
brute at intervals, so I guess they had come to the
show together. lam still wondering whether she
brought the dog or the dog brought her.
The Six American Dancers at the Opera House
have “a way with them,” to quote the battered
wife of one of the Pirates of Penzance. It is not
so much what they do as the way they do it.
The turn is an artistic hustle from start to finish,
and it ends up in a sort of high-stepping whirl-
wind. The music is an inspiriting medley of
American airs. At their first Melbourne appear-
ance, a big fellow-countryman in the audience be-
came excited directly the orchestra struck up the
opening bars. Before the clever turn was through,
he was thumping gaily with his feet and making
joyful remarks to the stage that must have made
the smiling new chums feel right at home.
At the present time the theatrical existence of
the stage child is being threatened both in
N.S.W. and South Australia. The move will
cause intense anxiety to heaps of people who are
interested in the performances and salaries of the
footlight babes; but it is a wise one all the same.
The small girl who made a hit in the “ Butterfly ”
opera as Little Trouble—she was an infant of
something less than six—informed someone confi-
dentially that when she grew up she wouldn’t be
an actress at all, but a housemaid. A child with
a rare domestic instinct like that should be
rescued.
When J. and N. Tait build their Auditorium
on the site of the Collins-street Presbyterian
Assembly Hall a new Assembly Hall will be built
opposite, next to the Scots Church. That will
mean the demolition of the fine parsonage in
front and the little old parsonage behind. But
parsons don’t live in city parsonages nowadays;
these two have been let to doctors for a whole
generation past. The modern fashionable city
parson lives in a luxurious suburban villa, and
comes in, for an hour or two, like rich men to
their counting-houses.
Stanley Mullen, Ltd., have taken over the
Australian rights of such of the “ Beanstalk ”
pieces as had been published by Francis, Day and
Hunter in England and the U.S.; and these and
a popular bunch of the others have now been
made available for the suburban piano rack.
Oswald Hoad, younger son of the Major-
General, has become engaged to Miss Sheila
McDonald, only chick of the late Arthur
McDonald, of Sydney, and of the living Mrs.
McDonald, of Caulfield.
Mrs. Stirling has departed for Medlow’s breezy
height. When she was all ready to board the ex-
press, daughter Mrs. Fenner hurried along with a
small granddaughter for her to take charge of.
Norman Fenner had gone into hospital for a
sudden ’itis, and simultaneously baby’s nurse had
given notice. Whereupon, Mrs. Norman fled to
grandmamma in a taxi, and implored her aid.
Of course, Mrs. Stirling loyally took over the
mite.
People looking for om ens can find one in the
fact that the 200-year-old carriage, which was to
have conveyed George the Fiver to his Corona-
tion, met its death by fire last week. If it was
the age alleged it must have been built when
Anne Stuart was about the end of her reign, and
when the first George Guelph was about to begin
his. One way it may be a vehicle which tells of
the end of an old family. The other way it may
signify the beginning of a new one.
Dragon flies are just like modern aviators ; they
come out in the still air and disappear when the
wind gets up. There has been an intermittent
plague of the insects round the bay this summer,
and they are so like flying-machines that budding
inventors lie on the sands and watch them for
ideas. Some noticeable strides are being made in
aviation matters, anyhow, when Graham White
can alight accurately in a wide street in Washing-
ton city (U.S.A.), leave his card at a friend’s
house, and then soar away like a bird about his
other social duties.
Some sea-bathers, who have returned from
swimming and diving round Flinders way, saw
the limit in bathing garb on those sunlit sands.
The shapely plungers were dressed in blue satin-
royal blue satin, considerably abbreviated. What an
exquisite woad-like tint those bathers’ bodies must
have had when they emerged ! One would
imagine that it was quite impossible for a woman
to be sensible as well as picturesque in the sea.
Yet it is comparatively easy if you have good
taste. A popular baritone has a wife with an
excellent figure, which she clothes, when going
swimming, in white serge with pale blue fixings.
The accompanying baby-blue silk slippers are dis-
carded on the white sand at the water’s edge, and
left to the mercy of any brisk, worrying terrier
that may hap that way.
From “Rosna” of Adelaide :

Port Adelaide Sailors’ Home has an unusual committee.
There was an annual meeting the other day, and not one
committee-person or subscriber turned up. The secre-

which there was an overwhelming attendance of one—
himself. The Government is to be asked to appoint a
new committee.
Rumor is persistently removing a bachelor (who has
been rather much before the public in this City of Cul-
ture) and throwing him to the Suffragettes in London.
’Tis said he will have the valor to marry one of the in-
dustrious, bill-posting sisterhood ; but whether he will
stay in London to help the lady clamber in and out of
Holloway, or whether she will renounce the Cause in
favor of Man, remains to be seen.

One Adelaide girl, at least, is blessing the prevailing
scarcity of Merely Anne. Returning from a globe jaunt,
she was wooed and won by a young ship’s officer, some-
what to the wrath of her moneyed family. However, she
persists in her love-in-a-dovecoc romance, and is saving
her pennies valiantly towards its speedy consummation.
Now, the family is short of a housemaid, and she is
filling the billet gleefully, adding her wages to the
pence aforesaid. By the way, the Government
is taking hold of the Merely Anne difficulty, and, as a
preliminary, is sending circulars broadcast, with ques-
tions to be answered by Mary and Marm alike. Also,
sundry people have heen officially appointed to collect
evidence on the subject.
I hear that Kilkenny and environs are infuriated be-

moment., I wouldn’t like to argue about it.

From a country mouse :
There’s quite a boom in first aid in Victoria ; and our
curate is having an awful time. Nearly all the first-aiders
of the ladies’ classes are maiden ladies who devote them-
selves to “the church,” and it wouldn’t be decent, of
course, to practise on anybody but the curate—he’s so
tame, and so good. When I looked in at last meeting
a lady was operating on each limb, and one was in charge
of his fractured skull. He had been treated for a frac-
tured thigh, a broken leg and shattered foot, compound
fracture of the forearm, a comminuted fracture of the
upper arm, injury to the cranium, a dislocated collarbone
and a broken jaw, and his torturers were still going
strong when I left to ring up the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals. Judging by the suffering de-
picted on the poor wretch’s face, he needed somebody’s
intervention badly. But the ladies were happy. Oh, •
they were radiant !
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

PLEASANT AND VALUABLE TREAT-
MENT FOR REDUCING WEIGHT.
A Remarkable Recipe.
Common sense should tell every stout man or
woman that no lasting good could ever he obtained
by fasting and exercising, nor by any other means
of wasting the tissues. Such methods are indeed
extremely dangerous and often tend to break down
a vigorous constitution. The bulkiest figures can
be reduced to natural proportions by a simple pre-
paration, the ingredients of which can be obtained
at any chemist’s. You can make the mixture
yourself. Ask for half an ounce of Marmola (see
that you get it in an unbroken package), one ounce
of fluid extract of Glyeyrrhiza 8.P., one ounce of
pure Glycerine 8.P., and Peppermint Water to
make six ounces in all ; shake well together in a
good-sized clean bottle. The regular dose is two
teaspoonfuls after meals. The reduction that this
harmless mixture will effect will surprise you;
and you need not alter your usual diet or give up
your comfortable way of living. You will soon
find that you are normally slender, and ever so
much better in health—stronger, livelier, more
energetic.
In order to meet a constantly repeated demand,
the above prescription has been condensed in the
form of a compact and perfect tablet known as
Marmola Prescription Tablets, and those readers
who prefer them to the liquid form can obtain same
of any chemist, Ss. 6d. per box, or post free from
The Marmola Co., 7 Barrack Street, Sydney,

FAINTING FITS
EVERY WEEK.
»
This Woman Became Thin,
Haggard, and Miserable.
♦
Built up and Strengthened by
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
The value of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to persons
who have become run down, and are in the state
known as general debility, is shown in the most
practical way in the case of Mrs. Mary D. Allen,
North Proprietary Lease, Crystal Street, Broken
Hill. Mrs. Allen became so greatly run down in
health that she was constantly going off into faint-
ing fits. The following are her own words des-
cribing her illness and cure by Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills.
“ Some time back my health became very poor.
I noticed faint turns coming on, and they got
worse and worse, till at last I was always subject
to them. I’d feel a headache coming on, and then,
without warning, I’d go right off; everything
would go black before me. My head would swim
and I’d go down flat unless someone caught me.
I’d be unconscious for perhaps ten minutes.
They’d put cold water on my face and hands, and
I’d come round again, but I'd just have to lie
down. All my strength would go. I had to en-
gage someone to do the work. I’d get these turns
at least three times a week. I had no appetite,
and I fell away so, and got very thin and haggard,
and in my face there wasn’t a scrap of color. I
had a constant dull pain under my heart, just like
wind. I dare not go out much unless someone was
with me, for fear of going off. I slept very rest-
lessly at night. I used to have mustard plasters
on my neck and under the heart to try and get
some ease. For months I went on in this way,
and only getting worse. I was real sickly, and a
misery to myseif; but having been recommended
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, I thought I’d try them.
After I’d taken six boxes I found myself a little
stronger, so I kept on with a couple of boxes more.
I felt a decided improvement. My head didn’t
ache quite so violently, and I wasn’t quite so sub-
ject to the faint turns. My appetite improved
and I felt a lot brighter and better. It took 12
boxes to cure me, but the money was well spent.
My strength and energy came back. I have been
a different being ever since.” Mrs. Allen s
husband is a miner, and both are well known in
Broken Hill.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The just-deceased G. B. Edwards gave
N.S.W. Premier McGowen the latter’s one and
only electioneering drubbing. McGowen ran for
South Sydney at the first Commonwealth elections.
Another member of the present State Labor-
party split the vote which McGowen should have
got, and Edwards walked in. But for that acci-
dent the chances are McGowen would now be
an enthusiastic Federalist instead of a narrow
State Frighter.
From the lately-amended N.S.W. Public
Service regulations :
If the Public Service Board so decides, deductions may
be made from annual leave, or accumulated leave, in re-
spect of time off allowed for naval or military training.
It is to be hoped the Public Service Board does
hot “so decide.” Lopping time off a State em-
ployee’s annual leave “ in respect of time off for
military training ” is the surest way to make mili-
tary training unpopular among State employees.
And there is no valid reason why the Public Ser-
vice should tie more unpatriotic than any other
employer. If the State sets the example of penal-
ising its employees for doing their duty to their
country, the private employer can’t very well be
smitten with a brick if he tries the same game.
At least, not with such a large brick as if he
hadn’t the precedent to dodge behind.
The hearty and soulful way in which
Japan now kicks its ally Bull so maddened
an eminent English banker and Freetrader
—Sir Edward Holden, chairman of the
London City and Midland Bank—that he
recently published a proposition that Britain
should boycott Japanese loans. Japan
prohibits British subjects from owning
land in the Monkey country, shuts them
out of the Jap coastal trade, refuses to allow
them to be shareholders in Japanese
banks and other enterprises, and doesn’t
allow them to engage in retail trade. And
the last straw is the new tariff, by which,
as soon as the present agreement with
Britain expires, the duties on most of the
goods of which Bull makes a specialty are
to be bumped lip to 300 or 400 or 500, or
even 000 per cent. Thus it is that Bull
begins to suspect that he warmed a frozen
serpent in his bosom, and that the'creature
started to revise its tariff for his injury as
soon as it was thawed.
The N.S.W. Decentralisation Committee
grows into a shrieking jest. It recently went to
Berrigan and examined 12 witnesses re the pro-
posal to build a dozen miles of cheap railway over
dead flat country from Finley to Tocuimvaal.
That line would give the Finley district access to
a port about 170 miles away, whereas now it has
to trade with one about 450 miles away. And it
required 12 witnesses to explain to the Decentra-
lisation Committee that 170 miles is 280 miles less
than 450 miles, and about that much cheaper.
The Weary Government of Victoria opens a
campaign against the proposal to broaden the
Australian Constitution. The other day, all
earnest supporters were called to a council of war.
Weary presided, and, after discussion, a valiant
“fighting committee’’ was born. As the com-
mittee includes such drastic characters as Peacock
and “Talma” Weedon, the fighting is bound to
be tremendous. Weary will, however, neither
perspire nor perish in the fighting line. He, poor
fellow, has to tear himself away to his much more
important duties at the Coronation.
The N.S.W. “Liberal” party is all right
now. The movement which saved it is headed by
the Telegraph
A Political Renunciation.
From Labor to Liberal.
It turns out that the mighty atom who has gone
over is an ex-alderman of Paddington. The row
occurred during the municipal elections, the other
day, “ the upshot of which was that a motion was
carried declaring that Mr. Lofts was no longer a
member of the Labor League.” So the Labor
party has lost a stalwart champion. Just what
sort of a stdlwart he was the final words of the
tremendous announcement show :
Even if they.'did’.not admit me, I would fight side by
side with them in the next election. I worked for Mr.
Oakes at the. last election (Mr. Lofca added with emphasis),
although it teas not generally known.
So it is a mighty supporter that Labor will have
to do without in the future.

It is mentioned that the Commonwealth
Government is installing a new-patterned rain-
gauge to record the enormous downpours at Yass-
berra. The instrument records the fall of rain
by a moving pen on a revolving drum. Well,
whatever else may ail it, that instrument runs no
risk of writer’s cramp, anyway. >.

SKY PILOT: “Thus, my lad, all round you see
the Scripture fulfilled which saycth, 'In the
midst of life we arc in death.' ”
The late tremendous rains completely
filled Sydney’s new big Cataract dam, as well as
the old dam at Prospect. Yet even now the
Water Board doesn’t feel too easy in its mind,
aiid Vice-President Jacob Garrard recently re-
marked in this fashion :
The great danger now was that Cataract and Prospect
reservoirs being full, Parliament and people might allow
themselves to be lulled into a false security. Twelve
months ago the Board, with a full knowledge of the
marvellous growth of water requirements of the metro-
politan area, urged upon the then Government to take
preliminary steps for the erection of a dam on the Cor-
deauix River. In the near future we were bound to again
have our years of drought, and he ventured to predict
that if those steps were not taken and a start made with
the dam within the next three years, the dry cycle would
catch us, and the ratepayers of this great and growing
metropolis of Australia would once more be in dire straits
for an adequate supply of water.
It is really wonderful how much water a State
capital requires, and how little water a State
Frighter thinks the capital of a whole continent
can get through with.
As an example of the devastating effects
of Socialism —even of Socialism conducted by
an ti - Socialists—
Won tli aggi (w here
the Vie. State
coal-mine is) may
he pulled into the
limelight. Most
mining camps are
visited by epi-
demics, notably
typhoid. This is
directly due to
the fact that
good old Pirate
Enterprise has
no time or money
to spend on
drains, etc.,
which don’t re-
turn quick divi-
dends. But at
Wonthaggi, Pri-
vate Enterprise
has been shoved
considerably into
the background,
and the State is
trying its hand
at sanitary con-
trol. As a result,
the general man-
ager of the mine
is able to “ at-
tribute the fact
that there has
been no wide-
spread sickness
in the camp to
the precautions
taken from prac-
tically the begin-
ning of the mining
settlement.” With
good old Pirate En-
terprise it is the rule to wait until the epidemic
breaks out, rush an expensive M.D. up from town,
and then dock the men’s wages to pay the fees.
Sometimes Pirate Enterprise provides free coffins ;
but mostly the men provide everything, including
corpses.
The Commonwealth Labor Government
doesn’t itself believe in borrowing ; but it doesn’t
mind encouraging the habit in others. Having a
million or two of Commonwealth note money on
hand, it didn’t go into the market and buy up the
cheapest loans offering and put the stock by as
the start of a Federal movement to rescue Aus-
tralia from pawn ; it just passed on a couple of
millions to the N.S.W. and Yic. State Govern-
ments at 3f per cent. Instead of using money,
when it had some, to reduce the Australian debt,
it used it to simplify the State Treasurers’ job of
pushing the country still further into debt. No
doubt the States, having made up their minds to
have a loan drunk, would have raised the money
anyhow ; but the anti-borrowing Commonwealth
Government needn’t have made itself an accessory
to the foolishness.
Premier Murray being favorable, the Vic.
Government will, it is understood, propose to
Parliament that the local House of Rich Land-
lords shall be paid. The title of the measure has
not yet been fixed ; but it is understood it will be
a Bill to Grease the Fat Pig.
MY LANDLORD'S WARNING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ostensibly the times are good ;
The harvests are immense ;
Producers of all kinds of food
Increase in opulence;
The land is smiling “fit to split,”
As lhough it were content
To bear the burdens laid on it
By Labor Government.
I’ve read about the bounteous crops,
I note the butter yield ;
To me by shopmen in the shops
The truth has been revealed
That farmers now have stacks of cash
Whicti lavishly is spent,
Despite the legislation rash
Of Labor Government
The showmen spread their hands in glee
To catch the golden shower ;
Tne pubs are busy as the bee
That robs the honeyed flower.
O fools 1 who flung your coin away !
Your folly you’ll repent;
There’ll be a heavy price to pay
For Labor Government!
I view ttie pleasure-seeking host
By day or ’neath the stars,
And try to figure out the cost
Of all the motor-cars.
But when my landlord called on me
To raise, alas, the rent,
He told me what distress there’d be
Through Labor Government.
From good to bad, from bad to worse
Tiie times are bound to go ;
The Wages Boards will prove a curse—
My landlord told me so.
“ This New Protection makes me sick.”
Thus spake the jewelled gent,
Whilst brandishing his walking stick
At Labor Government.
Therefore, to my enlightened eyes,
The Present looks not well;
I fear the “ workers’ paradise”
Will soon be changed to h—l.
Arrayed in sackclotli suit of woe,
These coming days of Lent,
I’ll pray the Lord to overthrow
The Labor Government.
Victoria.

Liberal and Reform Meeting.
First Smoke Night.
A well-arranged smoke concert, under the auspices of
the Liberal and Reform Association Debating: Club, an
institution formed for the purpose of interesting young
men in Liberal politics, was held at St. James’s Hall last
night. A first-class programme was provided, and during
the evening addresses were delivered by Mr. Wade, the
leader of the Opposition, and Mr. Cook, M.H.R. ...Mr.
Wade said that he looked to the society for much help in
the Liberal cause in the future. There had always been
a great difference between the Liberal and the Labor
parties. While the latter did its best to attract the
young men to its ranks, the Liberals had not shown the
same interest in them. —Sydney D.T.
Where there is smoke there is tire,
So give us the soothing “ weed";
The mildest sort we desire,
Whose head we can quickly feed
With Liberal opinions—
A well-socked, elegant bloqne
Who’ll out-vote Labor’s minions,
And prattle amid the smoke.
Where there is smoke there is fire,
ltut little of flame in truth ;
The oldsters faint and expire ;
So give us the fire of Youth,
With or without tobacco !
We must have it—right or wrong—
To be our docile Jacko
And trundle our hearse along!
“ The Weed ” has social yearnings;
Coarse Labor he mostly spurns ;
He takes his wretched earnings
And to “Society” turns.
We haven’t smoked for ages ;
We must to-night if we choke ;
Labor would give him wages—
IFe’ll pay the young fool in smoke.
Root him out from his scribble,
And hurry him straight along;
Give him something to nibble,
And sing him a comic song.
Talk to him very kindly,
For desperate is our need ;
He must burn for us blindly—
Our beautiful, home-grown weed !

NOTIONS
The finance committee of Sydney Municipal
Council branded itself bowelless when it refused Hugh J.
Ward the use of the Town Hall at a reduced rental for an
entertainment on behalf of the widows and dependents
of the Coogee victims. If the committee had any adver-
tising nous, let alone Christian charity and human feel-
ing, it would have given the hall free of charge. The
spectacle of a council of a great and wealthy city—the
alleged metropolis of the Southern Seas, the “ queen city
of the South,” and all the rest of it—“scaling” a fund
raised for the benefit of widows and an unborn babe is a
hideous one, and enough to make a man ashamed to
belong to such a blood-sucking community.
The fight between Johnny Thompson and
Papke was a disappointing circumstance. Papke regarded
the “Cyclone” as a mere zephyr, and was under the
delusion that he could out him just whenever he chose.
Thompson, who looked so heavy in the ring against
Smith, seemed only a stripling alongside Pa, ke, and
Papke’s opening was a mixture of flashness and
good-natured contempt. Thompson was no boxer,
and Papke knew it. He had no more preten-
sions to science than a pig has to astronomy.
He was a mere incarnation of brute force, and Papke
reckoned in his blindness that he had just as much brute
force and a lot more science ; so he entered the ring ob-
viously out of condition, and quite unable to put up any-
thing like a gruelling struggle. He reckoned his
science would make up for all that. Then things
began to happen. What Papke had not realised
was that ability to stand punishment, combined with
bulldog courage and determination, is worth a heap
of science.- So when the fight wore on and the Cyclone
had become a bull terrier, worrying and gnawing at a
much bigger and stronger dog who was considerably
short of wind, the audience began to sing sarcastically.
The “fight” became a procession, in which Papke was
doing all the flight and Thompson all the fight. At times
Thompson seemed fairly puzzled as to what to do
with a man who either could not or would not hit
back. And some of the W’orst smacks that Papke
got came home while he had his back turned to
Thompson and was about to streak round the ring. It
was a pitiful sort of show for an alleged champion to
make, and a cinematograph reproduction of it would kill
Papke stone-dead as a fighter of renown in his own
country. Once Papke slipped and came down on his
hands and the place where his tail used to grow ; but
there was no suggestion that he had been knocked into
that undignified position. His gloves became covered
with resin, and Thompson walked back to his corner
till the alleged “ Thunderbolt ” got his paws cleaned.
The belting of Papke lasted the full 20 rounds ; at the end
of the term a weary referee said Thompson was winner,
and when the fighters were last seen together, Thompson
was in full pursuit of Papke to shake hands with him.
Later on Thompson weighed at the ring-side with a view
to claiming the class championship. Papke’s careful
nursing of that alleged championship is a howling joke,
and his fight with Thompson was a weary farce.

Sydney Smith, who represents the British and
Colonial Aeroplane Co., and is introducing the “Bristol ”
brand of machine to Australian notice, has been in Mel-
bourne for a fortnight, quietly getting the measure of
local feeling re aviation. He and J. J. Hammond, who
comes as first jockey, or aerial pilot, to the “stable,” are
staying at Menzies, and they notice that the disappoint-
ment with the “Bleriot” two months ago has made Mel-
bourne scornful. But in Perth, lately, the English new-
comers gave some successful displays, which impressed
the military folk. Hanunond, in one flight, soared to
2000 ft. or 3000 ft., and the fly lasted 45 minutes. A short,
sturdy, fresh-eomplexioned man of action is Mr. Sydney
Smith, who talks well and looks like proving as
good as his word. He explains, among other things,
the meaning of a “certificated” airman. Each country
has an Aero Club, all the clubs are federated, and each
grants its certificate to a flier on what is practically the
same basis of proficiency ; therefore, any club certif. is
good in all countries. France, of course, ranks first,
among the nations in sky enthusiasm. Roughly
speaking, there are at present about 3000 pebple in the
world who have already aeroplaned, and 500 of these are
certificated, the others being in the experimental stage.
The number of French experts, as compared with English,
is about 300 to 40, or 7J to 1. Probably there are a dozen
accomplished Jap aviators connected with the army, but
the flights of the little brown men are not talked about.
Whispers of them come from Britishers in Tokio, but the
cable reports them not.
As for the future of the plane, Mr. Sydney
Smith is as hopeful as all the other people in the business.
The art of flying, he says, is no longer the craze of cranks,
but the studv of engineers. The aviator graduates from
the motorist'and it is to the motoring public that S.S.
will look for support when he gets fairly going. But
firstly, the military authorities must be captured and
convinced that the Bristol aeroplane is worthy to be in-
corporated in the defence scheme. All going well, the
British Aeroplane Co. will manufacture the machines in
Australia. A sufficient demand will create a factory. In
the meantime Messrs. Smith and Hammond have to court
notoriety by giving practical demonstrations of the aero-
plane’s powers, and these tests will take place at Altona
Bay. Melbourne has few open spaces suitable for aviation
attempts, and although the smellful district of Altona
Bay is most unsuitable from a showman’s point of view,
it seems to be the best for Mr. Sydney Smith’s immediate
purpose—which is not gate-money. Anyhow, he is going
to make a start there.
* * * *
The aeroplane had its first opportunity in real
warfare the other day, when a Yankee airman left the
Amurkan border to locate the position of the Mexican
rebels. He flew far and he flew high, but nary a sign of
the rebels did he see. But that is easily accounted for.
They were probably breasting the bars air along the
frontier when he soared over the land, and even a man
on an aeroplane cannot get a bird’s eye view of an interior
down the chimney.
* * * *
Moisant and Hoxsey, the lately deceased air-
men, met their untimely ends through stumbling into
holes in the air. In each case one wing of the aeroplane
fell into a hole while the other was in a rather solid lump
of oxygen, and the natural result was a complete overturn.
It was the same as if a huge fist had gripped the right
wing and hauled it down, and another had gripped
the left one and tilted it up. At present we
don’t know much about the size of these atmospheric
holes and clods, but certain it is that the only visible
safeguard is to increase the size of the aeroplanes till they
will be too large to be affected by the aerial orifices and
boulders. The perambulator is badly shaken by the
pebbles and tiny ruts, where the huge motor-car rides
smoothly. And that’s what’s wrong with the modern
aeroplane—it isn’t big enough.

S’Africa walloped Victoria with eight wickets
in hand. With a deficit of 82 on the first innings, Vic.
had to bat on a sponge that had soaked up an ocean.
The expected result was a painful 90, which left the
enemy only nine to win. Yet even that number cost
S’Africa two wickets. The match gave Faulkner’s average
an extra shine; he downed seven wickets for 26 in the
second innings, and his record for the match was 11 for
81. Vogler, who should have been a terror on a sodden
pitch, was again included in the “ unsuccessfuls ” ; first
innings, one for 72 ; second innings, none for 18.
THOMPSON HUNTING PAPKE AT THE
STADIUM LAST SATURDAY NIGHT .
District cricket premiership in Adelaide is a
thing still uncertain. Last year’s premiers were the
unbeaten East Torrens. North Adelaides had a similar
record for two-thirds of this season. Then the two met.
As it chanced, one of their two Saturdays was damp, and
Crawford and Whitty, for East Torrens, went through
N.A. nearly twice in an afternoon. But E.T. (with seven
inter-State men in the XI) has done so unaccountably
ill against the weaker teams that N.A. still has a com-
fortable lead. Sturt—Clem Hill’s district —is absolute
last of the seven teams.

News lately came to Sydney of N.S. W. cricketer
“ Andy ” Newell, who went for a walk with his dogs on
Bondi heights some years ago. Though long mourned
for as dead, NeweL is now declared to be safe and well in
South America.
* ■* * *
“Not at All» : “B.” (B. 26/1/11) notes the all
too true fact that 53 runs were presented to the Africans
in the Tests per medium of wides and no-balls, while the
’Boks only surrendered three measly no-balls; and he
advises the selection committee to smother Cotter and
Kelleway. It is an absurd idea. Cotter is an invaluable
bowler. He is an express, and when he precedes his
delivery with a run like that of a kangaroo, finally swing-
ing all his weight into the sphere, no-balls are occasion-
ally unavoidable. Kelleway also delivers a number of
no-balls ; but Kelleway is not in for his bowling alone.
His batting and fielding are features of the Tests. The
truth, which every old cricketer knows, is that the value
of a fast bowler to his side is not to be measured by the
number of wickets he takes personally. It is the mixing-
it that often does the damage—fast one end and slow the
other.
* * * *
If “the apparatus can’t lie,” the bowling of
Pitcher, the Victorian, is questionable indeed. Aphotoof
Pitcher, about to bowl, looks very like a photo of a
bowler about to pitch.
* * * *
The just dead Harry Graham got into big
cricket by fielding, when a mere lad, as a substitute, for
Victoria, against Grace’s XI. He grabbed his chance by
disposing of Briggs off Trott at deep leg with one of the
finest catches ever seen. In his first match against South
Aus. (Jan., 1893) on the M.C.C. ground, Victoria required
241 to win. Four of the best were out for a century,
when Graham joined Barrett, who had been playing
patiently. Graham started straight away by pasting
Geo. Giffen to the boundary in different directions for
three fourers. Victoria won that match by six wickets,
the pair carrying their bats —Graham 86. For the 1893
team to tour England he was one of the last picked ; but
proved the most successful batsman, scoring 107 at
Lord’s in his first Test match, and securing the batting
average for the tour. His 105 against Stoddart’s team in
1895 at Sydney on a bad wicket in the fourth Test match
is considered his best effort. With six down for 51, half
the Australians had been disposed of cheaply ; but
Graham, with some help from Darling and Albert Trott,
brought the score to a respectable 284. In this innings
Graham treated fast bowler Richardson’s deliveries with
the greatest contempt, running down the wicket to meet
the ball and banging it all over the field. He went to
England with the 3896 team ; but was not successful—
he had shot his bolt. His keenness in the field, lively
batting and daring in running between wickets, made
him a great favorite with onlookers. About seven years
ago he went to Otago (M.L.)as coach to one of the schools
there, and died in Dunedin on February 7.
* * * »
Saturday last saw the end of another round of
First Grade cricket in Sydney, with Gordon at the top of
the poll with 12 points, followed by Redfern and Uni-
versity with 10 each. Never was such a drop, for below
that is Paddington with only four, and Burwood and
Petersham in a lower place still with two apiece. But the
nethermost hell of all is crowded, for Glebe is nowhere,
neither above nor below zero, and six clubs range from one
point less than nothing to 12 fewer than a duck’s egg.
Owing to the eruption of South Africa there will be no
more First Grade cricket In Sydney till March 4.
Noble’s 219 not out was a remarkable score in a
remarkable match. The other party to the proceedings
was Gordon, boss cocky of the competition, and it never
had a stroke. Paddington went to the sticks and stayed
there, and all that Gordon could do in the round
was to get six of its wickets for 426 runs. And —
the humor of it—it counts as a draw ! That 219
was the only big score of the day, no other
batsman reaching three figures. Still it does look
as though Noble had abused his position as captain by
sacrificing a win in order to score a double century and
build up his average for the season. Anyhow, it was
darned bad tactics on Noble’s part not to declare. The
closest thing was the struggle between Waverley and
Redfern, the Syrian suburb winning by a margin of three
on the first innings. Waverley had biffed up 177, and
with the aid of half a dozen sundries Redfern managed
to get in with 180. University had left 311 on the board,
and Glebe went in with its coat off ; but it only managed
to accumulate 250, and was “ left ” by 61 on the first
innings. Petersham downed Middle Harbor by 66, also
on the first innings. Balmain played a sporting game at
North Sydney, when, having accumulated 160 for six
wickets, the innings was declared. North Sydney tried
to get busy, but Folkard got three wickets for 37 runs,
and only 88 were accumulated for five wickets—another
draw. Central Cumberland easily defeated Burwood, at
Parramatta.
The preliminary spar in connection with the
fourth Test match was a decisive win for Cash over
Cricket. On Friday and Saturday the strip of earth on
the Melbourne Cricket Ground was submerged. On Mon-
day, Captains Hill and Sherwell (who, according to the
law's of cricket, are the sole judges whether the wicket is
fit for play) decided to put the match off till Friday, in
order to get the gate-money which follows on the Satur-
day half-holiday. The victory is the first recorded win
for Oash ; and there’s no sensible reason why Splosh
should have won even now. As it is, the biffing of the
fixture back a week upends the rest of the tour, and
will give the S’Africans just sufficient time at the
end of the last match to heave its “port” aboard
and kiss any stray girls who may be hanging about.
However, the Board of Control is tucking up its sleeves
with a view to finding out why (as the controlling factor
in the tour) it shouldn’t have a say as well as Cash ; and
out of the ashes there should grow up a monument which
will greatly enhance the value of the Board’s existence.
* * * *
Adelaide (S.A.) cricket, on Saturday, was of a
biffy nature, the chief biffing being done by University,
which compiled 385 for eight wickets against Sturt. Drew
arose like Hercules, and piled up 225 not out, and Dolling
made 82. Another big heap was thrown up by North
Adelaide, whose total was 327, Pellew being responsible
for 115 (his fourth century this season). Altogether the
bowlers had a sorry time, and generally wandered home-
wards, sore and sad.

A large amount of oof will be lost and won at
Caulfield next Saturday, when the autumn campaign
casts its first shadow before —if the weather is agreeable.
The Oakleigh Plate, worth £lOOO to the winner, happens,
among other things. The 5J furlongs flutter over the
Caulfield course gives a chance to some of the slippery
ones that are marked “doubtful” for the straight six fur-
longs test at Flemington a fortnight later; and, apart
from these, some two-year-olds are entered. The juven-
iles don’t look very dangerous this year; but one never
knows what may happen in a race where the quick begin-
ners have so much in their favor. At time of writing,
Lautoka, Hoax and Golden Point look as dangerous as
anything.

The N.S.W. Professional Sporting Federation
is the newest body to propose putting life into itself.
The Federation will take beneath its wing the League of
Wheelmen, Athletic League, Swimming League, billiard-
ists, and the N.S.W. Rugby League—although there is a
yelp that the Rugby League may stay in the cold because
“it is not a professional body.” The growth of profes-
sionalism has of late been so huge that the proposed
Federation is the sensible step to get professionalism out
of the gutter, and it deserves support.
* * * *
N.S.W. League of Swimmers is swiftly growing
into a very big organisation. A recent £lO handicap
brought an entry of 95—a1l of which, though it means
money to the League, also means a succession of heats that
invite drunkenness and langwidge. The heavy prize-
money—from £lO to a 30s. open order—is very alluring to
the amateur side ; and it wouldn’t take much pushing to
swell the League’s membership.

That desperate effort of Wickham in the 100
Yards’ Breast Stroke Handicap was one of the finest ever
seen in a Sydney bath. Wickham was, of course, on
scratch, and how did he go ! T. Sinclair, who had 20secs.
start, made the pace a cracker, and Wickham came at
him like a torpedo. But Sinclair stuck to his work, and,
splashing through, won by about three yards from the
brown boy, who in his struggle broke his own world’s
record of linin, 17 2-ssecs. by a, whole four seconds. An
amazing performance.

The recent A.N.A. Sports at the Exhibition
Oval (Melb.) made a fair hash of things. “"Dad"
Wheatley—who was clocked at lmm. 56 3-ssec. for the
“ half” —now finds to his dismay that the track was some
five yards short; so his record is wasted.

On Hobson’s Bay last Saturday there was a
large and interesting battle for the St. Kilda yacht Club
Cup. The ornament was presented by Agar Wynne
M.P., and over 20 sail made a struggle to possess it. The
day, however, was rather mild for yachting, the breeze
betraying at the outset a shy and retiring disposition.
But during the race it freshened considerably, and
became of particular benefit to the higger craft. It
especially helped the scratch boat, Koomeela, which set
every stitch of canvas to catch every little puff, and
won the gaud by a margin of Bsecs. S.J..S. was second
beating the third craft, Kurrewa IL, by lmin. 27sec

Biking and bikists have received a knock-out
blow from the committee of St. Pat's Day celebration in
Melbourne. For years St. Pat's has liberally catered for
wheelers, and waited patiently for their reform. But at
last the committee has passed them out as hopeless.

That Cape-to-Cairo Anglo-German automobile
contest is the biggest thing of the kind since the Hew
York-to-Paris race. In some respects it will be a more
interesting struggle, for there was a fearful lot of fake
and swindle about the round-the-world run, owing to the
non-sportsmanlike qualities of the Yankees while the
race was on American soil. Moreover, it was not as
difficult as it looked on paper. The run across
Yankeeland was over a country that is alleged
to be civilised, and is supposed to have roads.
The run across the Gobi Desert was the worst part, and
even there it was not so difficult as it looked on paper.
The caravans of ages have left a well-defined pad, and a
distance that was impossible to a man on horse or camel
is a trifle to a man in a motor-car, and the reputation of
the Gobi is, of course, based on the experiences ofmen on
horse and camel. Probably the worst part of the whole
trip was in the western and better settled parts of Siberia,
for the roads were really heavy there.
The Cape-to-Cairo runis interestingin every way..
The English car will carry five men, and be under the
command of Captain B. Bentley, who has already ex-
plored the dangerous hinterland of the Somali coast and
Abyssinia in an automobile; With him are Captain Kel-
sey, whose eternal account is heavy-laden with the deaths
of many varieties of big game, and J. Henderson, who is
known as a London journalist, but most of whose
active life has been spent streaking over the
African continent in search of copy for London
papers. These three are deadly shots, and experienced
and resourceful men. With them are, of course, the
absolutely necessary professional photographer and the
motor mechanician. Of the 5800 miles between the two
cities the first 1600 miles from Capetown have some
semblance of roads. But beyond the Zambesi they
become mere tracks, and in about 200 miles cease
altogether, and the motorists will have to liter-
ally cut their way through dense thickets of
“wait-a-bit” thorn trees. For the route runs through
Nyassaland, past Tanganyika, through Uganda, the
Soudan to Khartoum, and then through Nubia, down to
the Egyptian capital. Not till they arrive at Khartoum
will the motorists strike roads after crossing the Zam-
besi, and Khartoum is only 1400 miles from Cairo. So of
the 5800 miles, only 3000 miles will have any pretensions
to roads, and 2000 miles will be through a trackless land
—a pretty undertaking.
Of the German expedition but little is known.
It will be under the command of Lieutenant D. Schmude,
and is subsidised by the German Imperial Government
to the extent of £lO,OOO. The German car will leave a
fortnight later, am), in spite of the way his name is
spelled, the Herr Lieutenant does not think his name
will be Mud. Lest the man who was running second
might accidentally drop on the tracks the first man had
cut through the thorn wildernesses, the wary Britain
stipulated that the German should follow a dif-
ferent route. This the Herr Lieutenant, of course,
agreed to ; and the petrol supplies will be distributed
along different routes, which will make the matter cer-
tain. The chief trouble of both parties will be the
rivers. They are truly terrible. Some parts of the way
it is estimated that the progress will be about two miles
per day ; and altogether, it is estimated, it will take 120
days to cover the distance, an average of about 40 miles
per day.
Frank Birtles’ Perth-to-Sydney bike record is
to be challenged at once by F. White, a brother of the
two Whites who hiked round the continent in 1900.
Birtles ran through in 36 days 15 hours, after being 10
months on the machine and fresh from two weeks of
fever. Under the circs. White ought to make good.
Still, this is a case in which the Scriptural remark about
the old road for the hard dog may hold good.
THE LOST PUNCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He is sloping- away at the trees ahead,
And sadly thinking- and thinking and thinking
Of the battles he fought in the years that are dead,
And it’s better than blowingand loafing and drinking.
He is slogging away at the trees that stand
On the further side of the northern clearing,
And his thoughts are back in a distant land,
And he hears his barrackers loudly cheering.
In the song of the saws and the giants’ crash
That are singing for him the forgotten story,
How thousands flocked in the days of bash
To see him fight for his country’s glory.
Then he had his punch, and his gold was free
To the wasters and parasites flocking round him
But now he must slave for a dollar a tree
In the lonely wilds where the rhymer found him.
Camp and coffee, and pork and beans—
Junk and damper, and tent and billy—
May you never know what it means,
When the pug is stale and the bard is silly 1
Pug or poet, 'tis much the same—
Bar or the bush—you can choose your haven ;
But I reckon it’s better to play the game
Be you a poet or Paddy Slav in.

“ Corso ” : Those elusive parties known to
the boy reporter as “ the authorities ” are having
their annual row about the Sydney Harbor traffic ;
and, while they are awake, I would like them to ex-
plain a little thing to me. The Manly boats are
licensed to carry a certain crowd of passengers ;
but they are not compelled to carry seats for them
all. The authorities don’t care whether the crowd
can all sit on the seats or not. All they are con-
cerned about is that the seats shall support a
certain number of persons in the water. In fact,
the authorities don’t apparently regard them as
seats; they view them as lifebuoys. Roughly
speaking, the seats will support twice as many
people in the water as they will when they are on
deck—if the people can reach them to be sup-
ported. Nqw, I am very much obliged to
the authorities for insisting that I shall have
a support when I am in the water; but is there
any reason why the authorities shouldn’t, on my
behalf, tell theco. to also provide me with a sup-
port while lam still on deck. I remember going
to Strathfield once with a Ferry director; and the
things he said because some half-dozen people
had to stand in the train scorched Mr. Johnson’s
beautiful moustache. Yet that was only an 18-
mmutes run, whereas it takes from 35 to 45 minutes
to get to Manly.
“R. 8.” : Melbourne Herald has a wild
special correspondent touring America. His most
recent contribution started so :
Chicago, Dec. 2. —At the crowded States Restaurant,
Chicago, a few days ago, I had the distinction of being
the only person who rose when the orchestra—for some
reason that I did not discover—played “God Save the
King.”
The undiscovered reason was that the orchestra
discovered the loyal correspondent’s presence, and
for the sake of the Empiah played the National
Anathema in his honor, and he was the only one who
rose. It’s a pretty story and a pity that facts must
kill it. The American hymn, “My Country, ’tis
of Thee,” has the same God-forsaken tune as
“ God Save ” (which the English stole from Ger-
many), and the loyal correspondent must have
appeared a self-conscious ass when he stood up as
if he was the country. The Chicago version of
the dreary old dirge is :
My country, ’tis of thee,
Where we choke liberty
With Standard Oil.
Pigs shrieking on the wheel,
Mad jangling hell of steel,
Comer of pork and meal,
And sweated toil.
And, naturally, nobody had the distinction of
rising except the man who didn’t know.

"Most people know
that there is whisky and whisky, and the
man about town makes no secret of his
suspicion that a considerable quantity of
cheap and sometimes immature spirit is
palmed off on to consumers under the label
and as the product of high-class manufac-
turers Among such men who claim to
be good judges of usquebaugh—and perhaps
reasonably —can be found not a few who
affirm that they patronise no house outside
of those they can depend upon getting the
brand for which they call. Said one of these
to a reporter on Thursday: —‘ I was caught
once, but never again. I had one nobbier, and
was ill for a week afterwards. I am satisfied
it was bad whisky that upset me.'" —Adelaide
Register, Jan. .20, ign.
Alleged Whisky Frauds.
FROM time to time paragraphs like this appear in
the Press, making complaints of the inferior
quality of imported whisky.
The Commonwealth Government has provided consumers with the means of
safeguarding themselves from the ill-effects of large quantities of inferior spirits
shipped to this country each year, and if the public will only take the wise precaution
of looking for the Commonwealth label on the bottle, which guarantees the purity,
quality and age of the beverage, it will be quite easy to stop the sale of immature
spirit.
It is impossible for the contents of any bottle bearing the “G.R.” label to
be misrepresented.
The Government seal, small and insignificant in appearance, unaided by
flowery ornamentation or brilliant coloring, is the identification mark that supplies
incontrovertible evidence of the goodness of JOSHUA’S WHISKY.
Ask for Joshua’s Government Guaranteed Whisky—the whisky that
supplies the proof of its purity.

The Woman
of To-Day
leads a busier life and has far
more strain on her physical resources
j than a generation ago, and is there-
-- fore more often liable to get run-down,
sluggish and constipated.
Few need to be told how serious such a condition
as constipation is—how headaches, biliousness, fevers,
weak nerves, anaemia and organic troubles are brought
on by its neglect—but it cannot be too often repeated that
constipation, to be properly and permanently overcome, must
be corrected by the most gentle and natural means.
The safest remedy —the one which millions use and which
the highest medical authorities have always approved—is
CALIFORNIA
SYRUP of FIGS
“ Nature’s Pleasant Laxative.”
It neither purges nor strains,the system, but acting quietly,
cleanses, soothes and strengthens the organs at fault and
restores the whole system quickly to its proper working state.

taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or haiuled in; and no MS. will be

T. P. Banger: Too vague; the sort of thing
that anybody could vamp in any city Pickwick :
Likely enough Bedford said it in a general, whirlwindy
way. Anyhow, you can have your point—Dr. Johnson
once saw France, in company with Thrale, the rich
brewer, who used to pay for Sam’s meals Bellerive :It
confirms an old suspicion of ours that in a real emergency
the stage super would be quite useless:
A TRAGEDY BEHIND THE SCENES.
When the curtain descended
Amidst an enthusiastic uproar
Behind the scenes crept a man
By way of the stage door ;
An actress was shot dead
In her dressing room,
Which overwhelmed the performers
With horror and gloom ;
The supers surrounded
The assassin grim,
But failed in their endeavor
To overpower him ;
Stand back, he cried in
Desperation and rage ;
Then shot himself thro’ the temple,
And fell dead on the stage.
... .Timhuctoo : You mean well, and we’ll let it drop at
that... .T.R. (N.S. W.): Sorry all fail. Your description
of the Australian race as “ uncursed, unconquered and
uncurbed” is interesting. Uncursed? \\ nat about
State Frights? .. E.M.L.: No, twice Stevo; Promis-
ing, but a bit too 10ng.... Aida: Two attempts at the
same idea. Hardly sufficient 5ki11.... D.G. (M.L.): The
last line sums it up nicely : “ Lost, lost, for ever lost! ”
When writing serious verse about a large body like the
earth, it is fatal to go on like this :
The world hangs on nothing,
Wrapped in solar glow ;
It rushes round its orbit
While seasons come and go.
Does that suggest an enormous cricket ball, whereof no
living being knows the age or history, hurtling eternally
through space? Not a bit of it. It merely suggests a
small, stout, fussy Judge who loves hanging people,
and always wears a red flannel vest, running round
a corner to catch a penny tram to the court....
The Outlaw : Yarded... .Dido : Not even one beer in it.
. ..Argon: Something cheerful might be built on that
boarding-house placard advertising “ Board and lodging
for single men—tram men included.” Afraid, though,
you are not the bard for the job.. .M.C. (V.): Revised
version of “ Werribee River” to hand. Once again you
have made the stream remark “ I am bursting of my
sides.” Only the people who frequent moving picture
shows explode in this fashion J.McC. : Is it any won-
der the Lord has given up trying to please people ? Your
Australian farmer-friend, who has had to quit Canada
and come hack to his own land, because the Cmadian
climate was breaking him down, laments his lost blizzard
in verse, and rhymes fondly of his rheumatism and frost-
bite. About the same time, in Melbourne, a cheerless
Scotch divine moans that he doubts whether our wonder-
ful sunshine is not the nation’s worst enemy, because
it enables the people to lead a happy outdoor
existence in the garden after working hours.
What is your friend’s ideal of perfect misery?....
P.J.M. : Promising verse, but not quite enough snap.
Try again Giddap : Too slight... .Bert R. : “The
Possum Snarer” is the rough work of an observant bush
optimist. Keep pegging away.. ..C.W.T.: The National
Guard is too painfully young to have blistering, die-hard
verse written about it J.R. (Q.): Opium story very
involved and not very interesting U.: “When the
Soul Rules” is overloaded with romance and rapture. It
needs some interest to ballast it... .0.H.8.: Verses
breathe a mild defiance of the Narrow Wayfarers. Quite
a lot of writers have done it better.. ..Benita : 0ut!....
The Jester: Can’t let you off under the First Offenders’
Act. Six months’ hard basket T.H.M.: Poem con-
tains too many graves and too much “ Alas ! ” We also
note the arrival of “anxious hours on leaden wing.”
Hurriedly rejected with three sobs... .Nitro : Some
humor, but you haven’t treated it skilfully G.H. :
(N.S.W.): It isn’t an ode—it’s a load, and a dry one at
that... .F.H.I. : Both dismal failures... .H.F.W.: Un-
suitable J.H.K. : Regret unable to use it.. ..The
Sheoak: “The City” is fairly strong verse, but it needs
some more polishing....Biltong: Herewith the “little
thing of my own which I am sure will take.” Sorry
we cannot supply the desired illustration by “ Hop ”:
He sat on his swag outside the Pub door,
And down his cheek ran a big tear ;
It made him think of the days of yore
When he had money to buy a long beer.
As he gazed on the cask that stood on the bar
And heard them say, “ Here, good Luck,”
Although it was near and yet so far
He wish he could join the ruck.
So that is the fate of many a tramp
When they have knock down all their cash, ,
It would be better to stick to black tea and the camp
Than gamble and drink and be rash.
Beer is a tragic fluid when it is unavoidably absent
N.H.8.: We found it most entertaining. An extract:
“The girl gave a little exclamation of dismay, and
started in pursuit (of the umbrella), but the road-sweeper
reached it before her, and with quite a gentlemanly
gesture returned it to its owner. She smiled as she took
it, looking straight into his eyes, and he reciprocated the
glance For a moment they were simply man and
woman Then, with a different kind of smile, she
passed on —out of his life. And he turned to his labors.
Probably to both the incident was closed and for-
gotten ' when ehe resumed her way, for he was
only a common laborer and she a society belle.”
National: (1) No law on the subject. (2) The 1901 census
showed 77'23 per cent, of the Australian population born
in Australia, o‘6B in Maoriland, 18‘03 per cent, in the
U.K.,and I'9S in other European countries, the other
2 - 08 per cent, elsewhere Tweed: Very jagged and con-
fused. Haven’t a prophet’s certificate, so can’t say
whether you will ever do anything worth looking at.
Can’t even give you an assurance that you will never do
anything worse than the specimen forwarded. It is really
marvellous what some writers can do when they don’t
try Yankee Lily : Putting Shakspeare on one side, you
need a deal of painting... .Poz: Hopeless Tantanoola :
Dreadfully long-winded on two sides of the paper
Stoopid : Cut out printed pars, mark with date and page,
and send to accountant.. ..Wyargee : Why, that inci-
dent was versed and paragraphed 10 weeks ag0....
Dive: May have been an interestinginterview ; but many
a pressman could make a more interesting report after
merely stubbing his toe against a tombstone... .Corporal
Bung: Matter was discussed quite recently.. ..A.R. :
Glad to hear from you ; but we’ve got no room for
vague hints R.E.G. : Yes, but who said they were
fresh kids every week? R.C. : Have no knowledge of
it Mollie B. : You’ll find it in Kipling’s “Depart-
mental Ditties.”
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
W.J.H. : There’s a smell of the bone-mill about them.
Vivian J. : A very mild jape.. ..Fel : Not much use
trying us with “topicals” from that distance....L.R. :
Promising Fatty: You’ve mistaken the address. The
Sydney Corporation tip is in Moore Park.
Thus London Academy in praise of an
Australian composer :
At the end of his summer season Mr. Beecham pro-
duced at Covent Garden an opera hy Mr. G. H. Clutsani.
It would not have been guessed that this composer was
capable of writing a brilliant opera. Yet this is what he
has done. After a single hearing, and in spite of our
having had no opportunity of inspecting its score, we
began to ask “ What may not a composer do who has
begun like this ? ” Is Mr. Clutsam going to do for British
opera what Elgar is doing in other fields? Here is music
which is fresh, and original, and personal—operatic music
which shows true instinct for the stage, and is emphati-
cally “of its time.” Here is real music.
Clutsam is a Victorian, who has been song-writing
in England for some years past.


PIANOS FOR AUSTRALIA.
ONCE=A=WEEK TALKS.
THE QUESTION OF QUALITY. —Fourteen thousand satisfied
purchasers testify to the wisdom of acquiring an instrument made in the
climate for the climate. Let us follow up details of former advertisements by
a few more.
WREST PINS —ln Imported pianos, all are made from straightened
wire cut off to lengths by machinery, and with the four facets squeezed to
shape by pressure, which disturbs and affects the metal. They are then
slightly tinned. In the BEALE PIANO they are made by ourselves
upon special automatic lathes. They are turned, not pressed, to mathe-
matical accuracy, and the facets are milled out of the solid. They are then
carefully polished and nickelled. Expensive? Yes, to the maker, but not
to the buyer, for in Australian manufactures it is required that the article
surpass in quality the foreign article, in every detail, because prejudice dies
hard. We have made more than three millions of these wrest pins, all in
actual use, of faultless steel and workmanship. You cannot get the like, nor
anything nearly so good, in imported pianos.
By selling direct to the public —no middlemen —we are able to supply
highest quality on patented systems at moderate price, which would other-
wise Be impossible; In pianos details are everything.
It is your interest and duty to call and inspect for yourself.
< BEALE PIANOS .are not the cheapest, but they are the best. Our
O-XicXIT dlcl ” is a quick seller at 135 guineas, on terms.

ANTINEURASTHIN.
Dr. Hartmann’s Nerve and Brain Food.
ANTINEURASTHIN contains neither drug nor chemical,
but builds up the nervous system by administering
the natural food element of the brain and nerves—
Lecithin—in an active organic state.
ANTINEURASTHIN is the only means known to Science
of doing'this.
ANTINEURASTHIN—There is no secret about it—to
every purchaser an analj'sis, endorsed by one of
London's most famous Analysts, is given.
ANTJNEURASTHIN feeds the brain and nerves, thereby
giving permanent good results, and not the temporary
deadening or stimulation obtained from drugs, etc.
ANTINEURASTHIN means Mental Energy—a power of
application to work, and of concentration of mind —
improved digestion, sound, healthy sleep, and
general good health.
ANTINEURASTHIN has received the endorsement of
some of the world’s most famous physicians, and has
proved itself in the Hospitals of Europe.

STOP
SMOKING!
OST MEN ..would cure themselves of
1' I the Tobacco habit if they kn’ew they
could do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it
up is to tempt death by Heart Disease,
Nervous Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and
Stomach, Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a h armless,
vegetable remedy that will make the user
of tobacco in any form absolutely abandon
the habit for good. It not only destroys
the craving, the desire, the appetite for
tobacco, but restores to health the entire
nervous system, and aids nature in entirely
eliminating from the system the Nicotine
Poison.

BILIOUS ATTACKS—PAINS AFTER EATING
CONSTIPATION AND OTHER
STOMACH
AND
LIVER
TROUBLES
Nearly every woman lias lier “ bad days ” —days when she is
tortured by splitting headaches, when she is irritable and nervous, or
bilious and dizzy, when she feels heavy and listless, or so dispirited
that only “ a good cry ” will save her from a breakdown. When-
ever you feel like that, be assured that your stomach, liver and
bowels are out of order. Headaches, bilious attacks, constipation,
nervousness, pains after eating, low spirits and sleeplessness are
only possible when there is some disorder of those digestive organs.
YIELD TO THE WORLD-FAMED TONIC
To restore your stomach to working order, and thus rid your-
self of all such troubles, take a few doses of Mother Seigel’s Syrup
daily, after meals, and you will soon be a different woman. This
herbal tonic has no equal in the world as a sure and swift stomach
and liver tonic. It is incomparably the best friend a woman can
have at every season of life. Try it to-day !
Mrs. McGrath, 205, Berkley Street, Carlton, Victoria, says :—“ I became
subject to indigestion. My worst troubles were feelings of suffocation and
oppression at my chest, and sharp pain in the back. After eating, I often
felt as though I would vomit. A doctor said I had chronic indigestion, and
he feared I Would never get rid of it. Pills and medicines did me no good.
Then my mother persuaded me to try Mother Seigel’s Syrup. I took it for
some weeks and the result was a complete and perfect cure ! ” —April 30,1910.

MEDLOW BATH, Blue Mountains, N.S.W.
MAJESTIC HOTEL.
COMPLETE arrangements have been made by the new proprietor (Mr. W. H. Burgess), late of the Grand
Hotel, Melbourne, for tbe comfort of visitors during; the forthcoming 1 season.
Medlow Bath is an ideal resort. The crisp mountain air is a delight, and the mountains; in their
Spring garb, appeal to lovers of the picturesque. Arrangements can be made at the Hotel for motors,
carriages and riding tours.
Motor parties can be arranged any time to start from the City Office—or your own residence —direct
to the Majestic Hotel.
To pedestrians Medlow offers ever-varying attractions. The views in the mountains are superb, and
hours can be spent in walks through the Hotel grounds.
Hot-air pipes are laid in many rooms. Daily Motor trips are made from the Hotel to Jenolan Oaves.
Further particulars can be obtained from the Hotel, or from the Sydney Offices, 42 Castlereagh Street.
"W. H. BURGESS, Proprietor.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“ Cellu Loid ” : I see somebody (B. 5/l/’ll) sug-
gests the possibilities of a turtle-raising industry in the
North. The business has been tried in other places, and
the people who have tried itare now either dead or sorry.
The turtle, in the first instance, is very modest and wants
several miles of good, open, salt water in which to spend
its honeymoon ; and canoodling is off when once it finds
itself imprisoned. Also, I have seen thousands of them
caught young, but they have refused to thrive in cap-
tivity. During many years spent in the South Sea
Islands, I have watched with gteat interest turtle
enclosures made and stocked by both black and white
traders. The former make turtle a study, and under-
stand feeding, mating, etc., from Ato Z. They form an
enclosure of loose stones among the reefs, so that the
ponds may have all the advantages of open water —
good fresh sea running in and out, rise and
fall of tide, etc. But the barrier, even in
such conditions as these, gets on old Hawk-bill’s
nerves. He refuses to grow any more than he can help ;
and, when he is at last about one-third the size of the
open-water animal, he dies. The shell, in such cases, is
so poor and cracked that it is only fit to be put with
third-class or bellies, and in either case is hardly worth
packing. There would certainly be a fortune in it for the
man who knew how. I have taken from one turtle, shot
in open water, four pounds of first-class shell which sold
in London at 51s. fid. per lb. —shell so valuable that I had
it carried in the steamer’s strong-room and manifested as
bullion.
* * * *
“Dollar” : In the early daysof the gold mines
some cunning individuals got from Big John Forrest the
right to deal with all the timber within handy distance
of Kalgoorlie. There are only a few people in the Wood
Company, chief ahiong them being Hedges, M.H.R.
Huge profits ought to be made ; yet it is alleged that the
co. pays no dividends. Apparently, each shareholder
holds some sort of billet, and gets big fees for counter-
signing a cheque now and then. To dodge labor
troubles, while getting things done cheaply, a host
of semi-s ivages were imported from Central Europe. The
concession is most cunningly worded. Tne innocent-
looking co. has only two rights : (1) To lay down rails ;
(2) to buy any wood which may be cut within the
specified area. If Smith, whom the co. doesn’t like, cuts
timber, the boss may refuse to buy it; if the co. likes
him, he has to sell at any price the boss will give. It has
another source of profit in the stores established along
the lines. If a man is hurt at his work, he is his own
master, and thus the co. gets over the Workers’ Com-
pensation Act. Latterly, the wirepullers for this octopus
have begun to fight the Esperance-Kalgoorlie railway
idea. These champions weep bitterly that the poor
woodcutters will be ruined if cheap coal comes in from
Newcastle. On the same principle, of course, the co.
ought to pull up its lines so as not to ruin the poor team-
ster, and the poor wheelwright, and the poor harness-
maker.
* * • *
A beautiful point about tne up-to-date business
man is that he is ever ready to rush in and grasp Oppor-
tunity by the hair. Just outside the Kichmond (Vic.)
railway station, in full view of the Brighton platform, an
undertaker has set up his neat advertising poster, con-
taining a full-length picture of the latest-model corpse-
limousine, with plumes and horses complete. It is
placed just where mangled victims can see its friendly
invitation and hear its pathetic call. If business isn't
done, it’s not the undertaker’s fault. Short of being on
the spot with his card and tape, he has done his best.

“ Saltcake ” : The Afghan tribe of camel-
owners has issued a new schedule of rates for the
cartage of merchandise from Broken Hill along the
lonely tracks West-o’-Darling. Anti Rham told me
about it, and added that they had put up £2OO. “ Oh, I
see,” I said, “we call that a bond. Any camel-owner
who breaks the rule forfeits his share.” The patient
tribesman looked at me in pity. “ No, no, no !” he said.
“ That for the lawyer suppose there’s trouble after we
kill that -l”

The ships are coming in with great cargoes'of
rosy expectations. Heaven and perhaps the Devil only
know where some of the British immigrants pick up
their notions of Australian bounty, but they are quaint
and wonderful. A just-returned Melbourne dentist tells
that a batch of immigrants stood on the deck of the ship
as it came up the bay, selecting the land they would have.
One took over a lump of onion country near Portarling-
ton, worth about £15,000 ; another decided to start an
orchard on the Red Bluff beyond St Kilda.
* * * *
The big wheat-sack iniquity has pretty well
disappeared from the Vic. and S.A. railways; but lately
a brief strike occurred in Melbourne through certain
Western District farmers or butchers sending their grain
to Melbourne per boat in the overloaded abominations.
The lumpers at first declined to touch them at all, but
finally consented to clear the vessel on being paid 20 per
cent, more than the Usuar rates. Fortunately, the inci-
dent hit Customs Minister Tudor in the eye; wherefore
that industrious party intends to hurry along the pro-
mised regulation to forbid the export of wheat in the old
spine-crackers.
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO PAWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The cold night died in wind and rain.
He faced the bitter dawn ;
I heard his weary voice complain,
“There’s.nothing left to pawn.
“ Bare is the hearth, the cupboard bare,
The lights are all put out,
And everything that is not air
Is folded up the spout.
“For love of God, kind bloke,” he said,
“Lend me an hour of cheer ;
My tongue is withered in my head—
Buy me a mug of beer.
“ Buy me a crystal sweet with foam,
A large and joyful pot;
There’s not a single thing at home—
My uncle holds the lot!
“1 walk about and tear my hair ;
And when we dine at noon,
We eat cold sorrow and grey care
With half a pewter spoon.”
He told the story o’er and o’er
With many a stifled sob,
Until I said : “ We’ll have one more—
One more—and here’s a bob.”
We parted at the whisky hedge,
Hard by the shades of ruin,
But I shall think of pawn and pledge
Through all the years to come.
I’ll think amid the haunts of pride
Of amber fouutlets drawn,
And one who muttered at my side—
“ There’s nothing left to pawn.”
Our lands are fair, our wealth is great
Where happy sunlight falls ;
But shining far across each State
I see three gleaming balls.
And as I watch our statesmen run
To Oohen every year,
I think of the remarks of one
Who murmured o’er a beer.
I hear his voice when evening fails
And all the stars come out;
He shows iije Vic. and New South Wales
And Queensland up the spout.
And oft, in horrid light of dreams,
I read of one dark dawn
When, through the budget, Ruin screams—
“ THERE’S NOTHING LEFT TO PAWN ! ”

FOR PRIVATE SUBDIVISION.
THE
Famous Burrawang Estate,
in the District of PARKES, N.S.W.
30,000 Acres of SPLENDID WHEAT LAND,
in BLOCKS, from 300 to 750 ACRES.
ON LONG TERMS.
WS. KEAST, DALGETY & CO. (Sydney), and WM.
TODD & SONS (Trundle) have received instruc-
tions from Messrs. Thos. Edols & Co. to sub-
divide and sell privately
30,000 ACRES OF THE
FAMOUS BURRA WANG ESTATE,
Situated on the Railway Line from Parkes to
Condobolin,
about eight miles from Bogan Gate R.S., and about four
miles from two sidings on the Burrawang Estate.
This land is practically all timber country, box, Belar
and some Boree.
It is considered by good judges to be some of the
BEST WHEAT LAND
ever offered in that district.
Adjoining this well-known estate are quite a number
of Victorian farmers, who have had good returns from
their places for a number of years.
The Estate is most admirably suited for
SUBDIVISION,
and water can be found by sinking anywhere between
40 and 100 feet, and in addition to this there are quite a
number of tanks now on the property we are subdividing,
and any amount of timber for fencing purposes, with the
railway running from 4 td,lo miles of thWportion.
To those in search of WHEAT PROPERTY, or com-
bining WHEAT GROWING with HAY GROWING, it
would be hard to get a better class of land than this.
Fora great many years Burrawang sheep have com-
manded the highest prices for their excellent quality,
and it is considered to be one of the best flocks in N.S.W.,
showing that the land must be of good quality to produce
such fine returns from'the sheep.
Mr. Todd will show people over the property, and on a
wire being sent to him, in care of the Burrawang Estate,
or to Wm. Todd & Sons, Trundle, intending buyers will
be met at the railway station, and shown over the
property free ofAfhMge.' .

The two heads of the old A.J.S. Bank
have passed out within a fortnight of one another.
Philip Morton, the chairman, on a ballot of the
shareholders in the reconstructed bank—the Aus-
tralian Bank of Commerce—was dropped heavily:
the first time such a thing has happened in Aus-
tralian banking for 20 years, it is said. The other
“head” was Francis Adams, formerly general
manager, and for many years the institution s Old
Man of the Sea. When the A.J.S. made its co-
lossal smash, Adams was fastened on to it
in some way as liquidator, and he stuck tight
until three or four years ago. It was not until he
went that the wreckage was cleaned up and a new
bank built out of the plenty of good material
available. He died last week, aged 75.
The stranding of the Eastern Co.’s big
liner Eastern is one of those calamities without
which the Commonwealth’s docking industry
would incontinently burst. Owing to the inade-
quateness of the Australian tariffs, the iron ship-
building trades get little or no construction work,
and depend wholly on such jobs. Their constant
prayer is : “Give us this day our daily wreck.”
In this base Sydney and Brisbane had an un-
friendly struggle to get hold of the hull of the
battered mail steamer, for it is a very long while
between such £lO,OOO jobs.
Having tried it on the dog at Newcastle
and Broken Hill—the two biggest towns in
N. S. Wales outside Sydney—Postmaster-General
Thomas has decided to adopt the practice long in
vogue ip Queensland,- Westralia and Tas-
mania, and close the post offices, with a few
exceptions, at G o clock. The yelp of
the State Fright papers suggested that the
mild and cautious Thomas was going to
pull up half the post offices by the roots,
pelt the public with the wreckage, and so blast
the other half that Commerce would rock on its
shattered foundations. This paper was still reel-
ing under the shock when it remembered that the
banks—including the State-supported Savings
Bank—close at 3 o'clock, and the Treasury, Lands
Department, Mines Department, and the other
State organisations at a few minutes later, and
many insurance offices are glued up by 4 o’clock,
whether you’ve paid your premium or not; and
it began to feel that, after all, life might be worth
living even if it wasn’t possible to buy a penny
stamp after 6 o’clock. What the people think of
this stupid attempt to stampede them into the
State Fright bog will be seen in April.
Although little has been recently heard
concerning the Kingston memorial fund, a good
deal has been done. Arrangements have been
made for the erection of a bronze statue in Vic-
toria Square, Adelaide, at the intersection of
King William and Grote streets. It will face
towards the spot in Grote-street where Kingston
was born,'and also the district of West Adelaide
which he represented in the Assembly for nearly
20 years. The commission for the statue has been
entrusted to Albert Drury, li.A., the English
sculptor, who knew Kingston in London. The
money subscribed is invested on deposit
with the S. Aus. Government in the names
of Chief Justice Way, Langdon Bonytiion
and Attorney-General Denny. Through Denny
a handsome donation was received ; the Gov-
ernment agreed to provide the pedestal,
which is equal to a gift of £5OO. The
statue is to be full length, and the figure will be
shown in a characteristic attitude. Kingston’s
father, who was the first Speaker of the S.A.
Assembly, was lieutenant to Colonel Light, the
founder of Adelaide, and he surveyed Victoria
Square, which is right in the centre of Adelaide.
Chief Justice Way is the lawyer to whom King-
ston was articled ; Langdon Bonython (of the
Advertiser) was his life-long friend; and Mr.
Denny was his colleague in the representation of
West Adelaide; so that the trustees have been
well chosen.
Turned-down politician Edward Pulsford,
in Sydney Telegraph, has blissful visions of an
approaching world-wide recrudescence of Free-
trade, and bids the busted local Cobdenite hope
with a large H. No doubt this is the sort of thing
which Pulsford reckons allegedly sane nations
will rush to open their doors to :
One thing which struck Dr. Stokes (Sydney Water and
Sewerage Board’s chief medical officer) on the run from
China to Sydney by the steamer St. Albans, was the fact
that the vessel was taking to Melbourne about 700 tons
of pig-iron manufactured by Chinese at Hankow. He
found that iron was being made at Hankow and Shanghai
so cheaply that it was being exported to places which a
few years ' ago were themselves great iron-producing
centres. Pittsburg, in America, of all places in the
world, was getting iron from China, and Dr. Stokes
learnt that a large American syndicate had decided to
start operations at Hankow, employing the cheap labor
of the Chinese, and sending the raw iron to their works
in the United States.
If the civilised nations throw up the industrial
sponge to the multi-colored horde, Pulsford doesn’t
say what sort of job he has ready for the thousands
of displaced miners, ironworkers, etc. Also the
stupid Dead ward doesn’t mention what is likely
to happen to the nation which allows its iron and
steel business to be choked by the yellow millions.

A Richmond shearer hurried off to Sydney
the other day with an invention to revolutionise
shearing. It is alleged to “do away with all gear
and motive power, the mechanism necessary being
enclosed in tbe hand-piece.” The complete
marvel weighs only a few pounds.
H. K. Alford, the new Mayor of Tdo-
woomba, was the first white boy born in the
Downs city. When his parents went to live there
in the4o’sof last century, there were only three
houses in the place, then known as The Swamp.
Last year 392,809 tons of sugar-cane were
crushed in the Bundaberg district. Only 1013
tons of it were grown by black labor; yet not
many years ago Bundaberg, the Kanaka-infested
town of Queensland, had a notion that cane
couldn’t he grown without Tanna’s assistance.
That often-talked-of ’possum farm seems
to be getting nearer. One W. J. Hall, who seems
to know something about furs, recently wrote
from Akmolinsk(Siberia) to the Curator of the Zoo,
which Brisbane hasn’t got, asking for an opinion
re the probable success of a ’possum farm, which
he is thinking of starting in Queensland. Some
of the things Hall wants to know are : (1) the
class of land most suitable for ’possum-farming,
and its probable price ; (2) the prospects of ob-
taining good stock, and the probable price per
head ; (3) the best time of year to start stocking ;
(4) the constitution of the ’possums, and their lia-
bility to epidemics ; (5) the number that could be
kept per acre, and the best artificial food for
them ; (6) the probable rate of increase ; (7) the
whereabouts of a small island near the coast suit-
able for a farm ; and (8) the capital required to
get a return of £2OO a year. People with stud or
pedigree ’possums will now know where to write if
they want to make a deal.
Tom Glassey, ex-Senator, ex-Labor-leader
and ex-democrat, has been given the billet of
Queensland immigration agent in the North of
England. He used to work in the coal mines
there before be came to Australia. Ex-M.L. A.
O’Keeffe, who was member for Lockyer, the seat
now' held by Chairman of Committees Armstrong,
has been appointed to a similar job in Ireland.
Queensland will have a big bill to pay for
the upkeep of cheap and shoddy railway lines that
have been lately rushed through. Every old hand
prophesied that the first flood would settle some
of the bridges on the Cloncurry-Mt. Elliot rail-
way line, and the old hands won’t have to lose
their prophets’ licenses over it. The Duck Creek
and Mai bon bridges have both suffered badly, the
latter being canted over something like 4ft. This
bridge is built too high to let the average flood
pass over it and too low to let the moisture pass
underneath ; wherefore it gets the bulk of the
shock from floating logs, etc. In the end, after a
few sackfuls of coin have been spent, a new bridge
will have to be built; and then bang will go an-
other permanent and reproductive undertaking
and another bit of Cohen’s security.
THE FEAST ETERNAL.
FARMER OUTBACK: “ Wot time do yer have breakfast ’ere, Mister?”
KMART WAITER: “ Seven to eleven, sir."
FARMER OUTBACK: “ 'Karens, Mister, four hours' eatin ’! ’Ow d'yer make ’er pay?”
K. M- Grant and James Tolmie, two of
the Denham Cabinet, new to Ministerial rank,
are ex-public servants. Grant was a telegraph
operator, and Tolmie a State school teacher. The
latter is now a newspaper proprietor. Macartney,
the other new Minister, is a Gent One. He was
formerly a bank clerk.
“ Flinderino ” takes a ride on the railway
line that is partly a buried corpse :■ —
The train leaves Cairns at eight in the morning, and
runs serenely along the banks of the Barron, through
Chinamen’s banana plantations, for eight miles to Red-
lynch. At Redlynch, which is at the f6ot of the range,
the engine ler,s go the front of the train, and hitches on
to the rear, and proceeds with much noise to push the
vehicles up the mountain. Up and up and round and
round; and then the stern-first procession comes to a
stop, and the passenger is told to get out. Num-
ber 10 tunnel collapsed towards the end of Decem-
ber, and through traffic has been impossible since then.
Between 200 and 300 navvies are at work shovelling the
mountain down the precipice on which the train hangs ;
and, although they have been at the job double shifts for
several weeks, there is a lot of mountain yet to be
removed before the tunnel can be opened for traffic. On
alighting from the Cairns train the passengers must walk
some 400 or 500 yards along a narrow track cut out of
the side of the mountain to a train waiting at the
Kuranda end of the tunnel. At Christmas time the pubs
in the back country were without beer, which was a dire
calamity, and foodstuffs at Mareeba, Atherton, Chillagoe,
etc., were sold at farfline prices. But now a light tram-
way has been laid along the track around the tunnel, and
flour, kippered herrings, sugar, jam, beef and other focal
are laboriously transhipped from train to train. A team
of 16 mud-stained navvies tows the trolly to and fro on
its short but perilous journey. The locomotives on the
inland side have long- ago run out of coal, but there is
firewood in plenty, so that doesn’t matter seriously.

And folk came in and said : “ At last he’s
gone—
A wonder ’twas the way he lingered on.
’Twas time his bones were laid upon the shelf,
No good to us and little to himself.
They say he’s left some money—goodness knows
Who’ll get it now the old curmudgeon goes.
Ah well, let’s hope he’ll get his lawful right
Where’er he lands to-night.”
And in my dream last night
I thought I heard them yarning round the bier
And struggling (with success) against a tear,
And Jones (who owed me twenty pounds) would
say
He never knew me throw a cent away ;
And Brown and Ginn, who’d borrowed many a
crown,
Would swear I was the closest cuss in town ;
And both would guess : “ He’s in a warmish
Where’er he is to-night.”
And in my dream last night
I went a-knoeking at St. Peter’s Cate,
And out he bobbed his bald angelic pate,
Demanding my credentials with a frown,
And hinting that my proper Road ran Down ;
And asking, brusquely: “Come now, show me
cause
Whv decent Saints should by this portal pause
And open wide for such a wandering wight
Oasuch a wintry night.”
Perplexed was I that night,
And murmured : “ If I tell the truth, I know
He’ll bid me part for regions far below,
And if I lie he’ll run the record o’er
And straightway rush me to the Sulphur Shore.
I’ll try a mild appeal. Sir, pray look down
And hear the gibes of Jones and Ginn and
Brown ;
Upon my corpse they spit their foolish spite—
My corpse that died last night.
“Consider, sir, to-night,
And weigh my words with justice, if you please.
I passed full fifty years with such as these;
I loaned them every cent I had to spare;
They picked my pockets, stripped me almost
bare.
And now, before my body’s fairly cold,
They’re beastly frank about my mortal mould.
’Pis true my record’s dark with many a sin,
But then l lived with Brown and Jones and
Ginn :
So if my page is stained in thy sight,
Have mercy, sir, to-night! ”
And Peter paused and shook his ancient head :
“ There’s sense in thy remarks, O Babbling Dead ;
I know, on earth, with Mark and Luke and Jo.ui
My patient soul was sadly put upon ;
And Matthew gave my name a nasty knock
With that old yarn about a crowing cock ;
Yes —Jones and Ginn were bitter pills to swallow,
But those disciples beat the Joneses hollow.
Come in, come in ! Thy halo’s on the shelf
(I’ve been thrombi all that earthly mill myself);
Thy wings are fitted up for early flight,
Dead—thou’rt in luck to-night ! ”
QUEENSLAND.
FURNESS BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane. February 18, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
We are in the throes of the Mary fund, in which
the clan Macgregor is severally and jointly taking
a hand, and into which the newly-appointed
Mayoresses are to be hoisted without delay.
Queensland is a hig and well-Mary’d State ; and
as the other States are three weeks ahead of us,
those shes owning the name, or anything like it,
are being urged to hurry along all they can spare
to their own particular Mayoress. Meanwhile,
the clan will tour towards Warwick, where it will
further encourage the circulation of the hat.
Greatness has weird ways of falling upon the
chosen. Our new Minister for Agriculture and
Stock, Tolmie, had, in obedience to the crack
of the party whip, hurled himself on board
the night goods train, leaving Toowoomba
about 11 o’clock on Monday, expecting the
lumbering conveyance to strike the capital
city at daylight. Instead, it struck a cow
or some other common obstruction, and, to show
its dignity, left the road, no„r could it be persuaded
to resume its proper position for many hours.
Meantime, the prophet upon whose shoulders the
double mantle was to descend had slipped away
into the land of snores, and remained unconscious
of the stick-up and of the momentous things that
were happening elsewhere. At 11 o’clock next
morning the train ran into a wayside shelter, and
a big policeman came forward with a smile and
grovelled. For a long time the sleepy traveller
couldn’t understand the kow-tow, until at last
someone thrust into his hands a morning daily in
which his portrait occupied a prominent place and
his past was (more or less) laid open for inspection.
The effect upon the three new Ministers was
humorous to observe. Macartney hastily assumed
a “ no one more surprised than myself” air, just
as if he hadn’t been systematically making himself
too nasty to Vie left out. Tolmie, on the other
hand, was portly and smileful, and visibly affected
by the stream of folk who came to congratulate.
Grant had the “I told you so ” expression of a
man who has at last successfully driven the screw
home. And Premier Denham—well, he is already
wearing the regulation worried look.
The Denham youth who became a Rhodes
scholar upon the day when pa became Premier
rows a solid oar, and is as good as most of the
chosen, although he will have to get a hustle on if
he is to range alongside young Brown, who went
last year. Our Premieress is in your own Blue
Mountains, preparing against the wasting times
to come.
The future Governor of Fiji, Sir Something
May, dropped up the river from the Aldenharn
one day this week, and tore food with the local
vice-regal party, after which he went on board
again, and departed for his treasure island. The
same thing happened with the Condor officers,
during whose brief stay in the Garden Reach a
hasty dinner party was got together.
This week will see the Carl Palmers back from
the Cold part of the Empire. Their fine home,
Auclienflower—a wedding present from Mrs.
Thomas Mcllwraith, by the way—is getting a final
polish on against their coming.
Talking of brides reminds me that there was a
pretty knot-tying at St. Stephen’s on Wednesday,
when Mr. Owen R. Cusack, of Cloneurry copper
town, undertook to pay the future bills of Miss
Mary Hecklemann, of this city. The decorations
were elaborate, for the bride has friends innumer-
able. The bridegroom handed his bride a prayer-
book, diamond-set earrings, a gold watch and
muff chain as outward and visible signs of “his
worldly goods” ; and the lady seemed satisfied.
Within this city there is, at present, an orange
sapphire of such gigantic dimensions that whoever
finally has possession of it will be forced to have
it set as a chest protector. Dug up at the Anakie
fields, it weighed 43 carats, and has taken a month
to cut. Its present owner, a gem enthusiast by
the name of Knowles, well and favorably known
to the tourist of the South,; regards it as the finest
thing of its kind that he has seen in his 33 years’
experience. I offered to take care of it for him,
but he is of a suspicious turn of mind,, and had'a
silly prejudice against putting it anywhere except
in a bank.
We are to become possessed of a new Cafe next
week, when the top part of the “ Big Block ” (the
Finney-Isles shop) will become the home of the
grill and the mashed cutlet. A series of Love Gates
or something of the kind has been put up to keep
off the sun’s too persistent rays, and the outlook
as you toy with an omelette or a pigeon, will be
of the bird’s-eye variety, taking in most of the
city. The chef is, I hear, to be a white wonder.
The Eastern, light from the jettisoning of pea-
nuts, left for Sydney yesterday, after making a
hasty toilet in the local dry dock. Upon the
shores of Moreton Bay, a new disease has sprung
up among the juvenile population, due to an
overdose of the saltwater-soaked food.
The last of the professors for the new Univer-
sity has set foot in the Commonwealth, and the
official opening will be the next excitement. So
far, the examinations reveal a deal of promising
youth to work upon ; and if only the Uni. hadn’t
been stuck down in a very unsavory fragment of
the city, we might look forward to an entirely
successful beginning. But here again the Kidston
obstinacy has provided the blot upon the-
’scutcheon.
Nicholson and Co., Ltd., are launching out.
They have just bought a fine frontage nextFmney-
Isles’, and the land and the new building will run
the music firm into about £28,000. On the same
day that Chairman Tom Davis brought off this,
deal, arrangements were made to take over the
ancient Darling Downs’ music-house business of;
Harston and Co. And, on the top of. that, I hear
that a new Haymarket (Sydney) branch is to be
opened, and generally a vigorous. Merry Widow
quick-step policy pursued.
Your Miss Isabelle MacCallum, only daughter
of the Professor of English Literature .at Sydney
University, has just become engaged to our Dr.
Lightoller, whose sister is this week marrying one
of the Murray Priors.
Nora McKay, the Queensland violinist, has said
“ I will ”in England. Her husband is Dr. R. A.
O’Brien, who graduated at Melbourne, and subse-
quentlychased themicrobeforßananaland’s Public
Health Department. After some private practice
at Cairns he took himself off to join in research
work in the city where fog is epidemic. What-
ever else his search gave, he found a wife that
Bananaland is proud of.
Yours affectionately,
MARIC.
Charleville, which somehow considers itself
an outlying portion of S. A. and writes diligently
to the Adelaide papers, gives the Register (21/1/11)
a touching instance of fidelity on the part of a dumb
creature. It was an artesian bore on a selection
that changed hands. It “ceased to flow on the
day of the sale, and the water is now 10ft. from
the casing.” One seems to have heard of a similar
reluctance to work for a new master on the part of
Chaffinches, wild eats and other creatures.
They have taken to cotton-growing in
earnest at Capella. Some 20 years ago a Mrs.
McCarthy planted a few bushes there, and they
haven’t shifted since. Even the big 1900 drought
didn’t move them. Lately almost every farmer
thereabouts has put in his plot, and, with the aid
of the Federal bonuses, the results have been
worth their trouble. A lot of 19 bales, sent to
Liverpool, brought an average of lOd. alb., though
the Capella grower himself got only lfd. a lb.
Now the local grower is asking the Government
to find a press and a cotton gin ; and if it won’t
the Fairbairn Pastoral Co., which owns a lot
of Peak Downs country, and intends to cultivate
the cotton, is to be tapped on the shoulder.

TIME TESTS •OLLTniNW
SIMONIDES’ truism, “There is no better test of a man’s work than time,” applies with
special force to motor tyres. Because Continental Tyres have won so many honors
in time tests, we do not hesitate to give the best of all guarantees—complete
satisfaction —with every tyre we sell.
Length of service is a most important point to consider when buying motor or cycle tyres.
The tyres fitted to new cars by manufacturers are not always the most suitable for the car’s
requirements—very frequently they are too small to carry a “full load ” over the rough roads so
frequently encountered beyond the city area.
Before finally purchasing a car obtain full particulars of the size of both front and back tyres,
and ask us if they are large enough. A word of advice before you buy may save you a big tyre bill
later on, and much trouble and inconvenience in the meantime.
The new 1911 Model de Course Square Tread Continental Tyres have arrived. In quality and
workmanship these tyres show further improvement of the kind that will minimise tyre troubles.

210 QU-EN STREET —BRISBANE
From one of Victoria’s very ancient
mariners:—
lie the first shots fired with serious intent in Hobson’s
Huy (15. 29/L2/10). The Fantome's guns were notdirected
at ttie Schomberg, but probably at the Marco Polo,
which vessel, at the time the Fantome was in Port
Phillip, was commanded by Forbes. An indisputable alibi
can be set up on behalf of the Schomberg, as that vessel
never was in Hobson’s Bay. On her first voyage from
Liverpool with several hundreds of passengers, and with
Forbe- in command, she was quietly beached in calm
weather in a sandy cove between Warrnambool and (Jape
Otway. The passengers and crew were all landed safely,
hut the ship never came out of that cove. When
leaving Liverpool, Forbes declared that, unless
Davy Jones stopped him, the Schomberg should
establish a record for the passage to Melbourne.
At Cape Otway the run hail already exceeded the Lime in
which it had been accomplished by Forbes himself in the i
Marco Polo ; and th re upon lie was almost universally j
credited or debited with having deliberately sailed the
S shorn berg on to the beach. He had, a few months be-
fore, made the run from Melbourne to Liverpool via Cape
Horn, in the Lightning, in 63 days, and the record then
established remains unbeaten to this day, and in all pro-
bability will stand unparalleled. On the passage the
Lightning was pitted against a rival ship, the lted
Jacket, and the incidents connected with that ocean race
are so extraordinary as to deserve permanent record.
During the gold-digging days of Victoria great numbers
of passengers were conveyed from England by the vessels
sailing under the Black liall and the White Star flags, and
intense rivalry existed between the two lines. In 1854 the
Black Ball’s Lightning and the White Star’s Red Jacket
were appointed to start on their maiden voyages about
the same time. It was then arranged that they should
leave Liverpool on the same day and at the same hour,
and race the round trip, Liverpool to Melbourne via the
Cape and Melbourne to Liverpool via the Horn. The
Red Jacket arrived first in Hobson’s Bay in 67 days, sur-
passing all previous voyages by six or seven days. The
Lightning came in 10 days behind. The master of
the Red Jacket started on the return journey in
the best of spirits; and when he reached the
Mersey in 73 days from Melbourne, the possibility of his
having been beaten never entered his mind. Yet, from
his pilot he learnt that the Lightning was berthed in one
of the Liverpool docks. Forbes, who was in command of
the Lightning, had hustled and got out of Hobson’s Bay
in three or four days' less time Ilian that occupied by the
Red Jacket; and his wonderful passage to Liverpool in
63 days would not have won the race but for the time
thus saved, for each vessel was exactly 140 days at sea.
Weird stories are told of the run from Melbourne to
Liverpool in the Lightning. Forbes set his royals when
leaving Port Phillip Heads, and would not allow sail to be
taken in during the entire voyage. What this involved
when the vessel was careering along 1 on pitch dark nights,
with a howling gale behind, needs no description. There
was almost a mutiny; but Forbes maintained his
authority with the aid of a loaded revolver. I believe
some of iiis sailors never faced the sea again.

smokers of my Cigars, too.
Talk about joy! Why, to sit round a camp
fire, over a billy of tea, pitching to your mates,
each of you smoking one of my Cigars, joy isn't
in it! It’s just simply bliss!
As the yarns go round, the blue smoke
curling upwards in a fragrant cloud, the
smooth cool Havana flavor lingering on your
lips—l tell you, you’ll spend some of the
happiest hours of your life.
Letters are coming in to
me in shoals from all over
Australasia, praising up my
Cigars. Take one I’ve just
got as I write this, for in-
stance—it's from a chap on a
cattle station up in Northern
Queensland. He writes:—
“Those DIADEMAS Cigars
ofyoursare just alright. I’vo
always smoked a pipe—but
no more. Not (.hat I’ve given
up pipe-smoking altogether;
but when I want a real smoke
—something rich—l light up
one of your DIADEMAS,
and give myself up to its
pure enjoyment."
To make you acquainted
with my Cigars, and prove
their value, I make you this
FREE OFFER of
5 or 6 CIGARS
you may select.
Send for 100 of any of
Remit the nmo'.uvt, and
I will deliver promptly,
postage or carriage paid,
to any address in Aus-
tralia.
Smoke 5 of 6 of them, and If they’re
not superior to most Cigars at double the
price, send the remainder back to nie, and
J’il return every penny of your money—no
charge made for the Cigars you’ve smoked.
My Cigars are made from the very finest
mild, rich mellow Tobacco, the filling or inside
heart of the cigar being all straight long
leaf. The Cigars are hand-made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before
it goes but to a customer; and is guaranteed
to burn freely and draw easily.
There s no “catch” about this offer—it's just
plain and honest. To prove it, you can refer
as to my financial position and way of doing
business to the Manager of the Commercial Bank
of Australia, Collins Street, Melbourne. He’ll
vouch for me.
Send down for a box to-day—once you smoke
them you'll make it a habit, and buy regularly
from me. When ordering, say whether you
like light, medium, or dark colors,

CHATEAU TANUNDft
n. . sew
THAT found label on the Chateau Tanunda Bfandy bottle is
insignificant enough in appearance, but it has a significant
meaning.
Placed there by the Commonwealth Government, it proves, first,
and most important of all, that Chateau Tanunda Brandy is a
PURE AUSTRALIAN STANDARD GRAPE BRANDY.
In these days, when doctors are protesting so vigorously against
the use of raw, fiery alcohols distilled from improper materials, it is
important to know that CHATEAU TANUNDA BRANDY is a
STIMULANT ABOVE SUSPlClON—guaranteed so by the
Government.
Before this label is affixed to the bottle, the Customs officers
have to be satisfied that the contents have been —
U Distilled WHOLLY FROM GRAPE WINE by a pot
still, or similar process, at a strength not exceeding 40
per cent, overproof.
2. Matured by STORAGE IN WOOD for a period of NOT
LESS THAN TWO YEARS.
3. Certified by the Commonwealth officer to be PURE
BRANDY.
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED.

When Weaning Baby
The Best Food to give is
The Allenburys' Milk Food No. 1.
On the addition of water as directed, it forms an accurately estimated
humanised milk, and may be given alternately with the natural food
without fear of upsetting the child or causing digestive disturbance.
Weaning can therefore proceed gradually with comfort both to mother
and child.. Farinaceous foods should hot be given at this time.

THE CASE IS CLEAR.
The case is clear. On the one hand we have fountain pens that
splutter and leak—fountain pens that cannot be filled without a
bulb filler—that are in a word not themselves without this old-
fashioned friend, the filler. But in my hand here I have an
Onoto Pen—that cannot leak and that fills itself. A pen a child
can use—a pen no wise man would be without.
—You, sir, should own an Onoto Pen, it cannot leak.
—lt fills itself, it never splutters of scratches.
And it is British made. Now, is 12/~ too much to pay for such a pen—
or a little more for the new G model. All stationers, jewellers and stores
sell it. Go to-day, while the evidence is fresh in your mind—to the nearest
stationer’s and say—“ An Onoto Pen, please.”

A Ballad of Bourke-street
Corner.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
warm dusk closes on the street.
Herald of night, and love, and rest;
And love’s own planet, fair and sweet,
Burns o’er the buildings to the west.
The arc-lamps wake, their steel-blue glare
Stabbing the twilight through and through,
A breeze of evening stirs the air,
The cold stars glitter into view.
Crowded beneath the awnings wide,
In aimless wanderings up and down.
Eddies and flows, in full flood-tide,
The vice and crime of Melbourne Town.
The lounging ruffians, stuffed with lies
And tales obscene and curses loud ;
The rat-faced men with furtive eyes.
Shuffling, round-shouldered, through the crowd !
The knaves who gather round the horse,
The fools who cheer the football-game,
The magsman, spieler, and the coarse
Sponger upon a woman’s shame ;
Thugs, hooks and welshers when the lights
Of Bourke-street corner hiss and flare,
Spewed from their slums, on summer nights,
Plan out their next day’s knavery there.
Now, at the corner three ways meet,
Two by the jostling crowd known well;
The third, dread, path for human feet.
The smoke-grimed Causeway into Hell.
Smoothworn, unseen, it stretches far
From flaring gas and hissing arc,
From lit saloon and gilded bar
Into the Horror of the Dark.
He was a lad of sixteen years,
A suckling, scarce enlarged from school,
His book spelled out in wrath and tears,
Damned, because fathered by a fool.
His father was a worthy man,
A jobbing cobbler his estate,
A clumsy, peaceful artisan
As pious as illiterate,
Who on the Sabbath churchward went
To praise Jehovah’s Love and Might,
Forgetting, while on the Lord’s Son bent,
His own, who walked the streets at night.
His son, who felt the Corner’s lure,
Its taste of pleasure, bitter-sweet,
Received in fell investiture
The lawless freedom of the street.
Three wasted years corruption wrought,
From toil’s clean path he turned aside ;
Work was for fools, his comrades taught—
And the Third Causeway opened wide.
He learned to scoff at Love and Truth,
Beauty and Knowledge passed him by ;
The April fragrance of his youth
Was stained with cheap debauchery.
Helpless before his destiny,
Drink conquered him and brought him shame ;
As one well-versed in larceny
The watch-house keepers knew.his name.
Kind Beauty in the amorous dark-
insolent dream for such as he !
A giggling hussy in the park
Is Bourke-street’s share of gallantry.
He guessed at loves more debonair
Than might his boldest hope essay,
When comely women, chaste and fair,
Passed, laughing softly, to the play,
Clear-eyed and gay, with flower-decked hair ;
And, in their haste, a treacherous shawl
Might leave a cream-sweet shoulder bare
To envy of the general.
For man or beast, or Bourke-street “head,”
It is not good to live alone ;
And so, by purblind instinct sped,
He took a woman for his own.
A chorus-girl became his bride
(He took her in the hallowed way),
A damsel of experience wide,
The stage-door-haunting gallants say.
Lo ! Lust and Little Wit are wed-
God’s mercy on the sons of men !
Travesty of the light which led
The steadfast heart of Imogen
For Lust of Folly weary grows,
And Folly seeks fresh Lust ere morn ;
So swift between them hate arose,
And each walked hand-in-hand with Scorn.
Cheated, insulted and abhorred,
At heart a vengeful courtesan,
In treason to her proper lord
The current of her amors ran.
Still she must eat and clothe and live
Whatever foulness might betide ;
Her chosen man refused to give—
Well, there were other men outside.
Nor troubled much in spirit he,
Until, his scandal’s aftermath,
With japes at wholesale cuckoldry
His comrades roused his righteous wrath.
Of their vain jests was murder born,
In his hot brain the red Thing woke,
Conceived in drink and fed by scorn,
It grappled with his soul and spoke :
“ She —she who laughs and wins—your wife,
Your shame ! Shall she unpunished go ?
Unto her trespass lay the knife ;
Strike,!—you may end it with the blow.”
Three days he drank with sombre face,
Until his rage aloof did stand
Like a great wave, which, for a space,
Towers ere it thunders on the sand.
Then in Night’s forehead, fair and still,
The news was cried along the street:
“Appalling Crime at Hotham Hill,”
Shrieked in black headlines from the sheet.
Yes, she was dead ; her ill-starred life
With all the queans and drabs who died
In all the years ; her husband’s knife
Brought swift divorce and peace beside.
As Judas sold the Son of Man
So Bourke-street’s magsmen sell their kind ;
A thief along the pavement ran,
A tall detective stalked behind.
The tall detective and his prey
The watch-house keepers smiled to see.
“ And what’s the charge this time ? ” asked they.
“’Tis bloody murder, sirs,” said he.
Death, swift and healing, ran his wish,
No better asked he than to die ;
But the Law carved him as a dish
Served to half-sated gluttony.
By form precise it slowly brought
Its day of vengeance round at last,
When, in the hushed dusk of the court,
The black-capped Judge his sentence passed.
“You shall be taken hence,” he said,
“ Hereafter on the gallows-tree.
Hanged till your body shall be dead ;
And on your soul Christ’s mercy be.”
The dull court faded from his sight
As though he had already died ;
The sweat gleamed on his forehead white,
And from the Dark a woman cried :
“ Husband, mine eyes are dulled with mold,
My soul in quenchless flame is thrust;
You slew my body, now, behold !
Yours, too, is sentenced—it is just! ”
Oh ! chill the wind blew from the north,
And curdled with grey cloud the sky,
When from his cell they brought him forth
Within the grey gaol yard to die.
He felt the rope about his throat,
And watched the hangman undismayed,
While by his side, in quavering note,
The frightened chaplain knelt and prayed.
The drop-bolt turned beneath his feet,
Close-pinioned to his death he fell;
The red flag rose, and on the street
Men heard the slow-tolled prison bell.
So, till his body should be dead,
They watched it turning in the air :
And “ Look ! ” a senior-warder said,
“ ’Tis Bourke-street corner hanging there! ”
Still the warm dusk enwraps the street,
Herald of night and Love and rest.
And Love’s own planet, bright and sweet,
Burns on the skyline to the west.

The arc-lampS wake, their steel-blue glare.

HASSAN.
The Old Digger.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHAT his real name was nobody
seemed to know —and nobody cared.
He was simply known as Bendigo, be-
cause he had so much to say about Bendigo where-
ever he went. He was a wandering digger; he
had never been anything else in his life. He had
passed his three-score and ten ; every hair on him
was snow-white ; he was wrinkled and bent, but
he still had a ruddy glow on his face and the
strength to burrow down through rock and granite.
For more than half a century he had padded
the hoof from goldfield to goldfield, and from
squattage to squattage. He had made fortunes in
his time—little ones—and blewed them like a
whaler. Every pub knew him as “ the Old Mur-
ray Barge,” because he had a lumbering gait and
had been stranded so often, and because he wan-
dered up and down the rivers and always alone.
So he had two names.
At last he drifted into quiet little Narraburra,
where a small diggings had broken out. That
was years ago. Hundreds had come to it with
money, and had gone away again with nothing.
It was a good poor man’s field—it kept him poor.
Still Bendigo and a few Chinamen stuck to it.
Also some grizzled fossickers, who begged “ old
things” off passing drovers to avoid arrest for
indecency. Once a discoverer of fields and the
leader of rushes, Bendigo was now content to fall
in with the fossickers, working over old ground
long after the busy hum of life had departed. Old
men foregather on these fossicking fields, where
they can make just enough to live on till their
days are numbered. And when their bodies grow
weak, and their fare is scanty and irregular, they
become correspondingly cunning and selfish. Ben
developed both these characteristics before he had
been very long at Narraburra.
Things got so brisk in the little place that every
doorpost had someone leaning against it, waiting
for better times or a dog fight. At this stage
Downey, the storekeeper, and Rocky Roberts,
the publican, offered £5O for the discovery of gold
on new ground. It was Rocky himself who stipu-
lated that it should be paid to the men who
pegged.out the first claim.
The reward caused quite a stir among the
fossils. They met at Ben’s canvas humpy at
nights to discuss it, and the subject led Ben off
into a long history of rewards and lucky finds and
rushes that he had known in the course of an ex-
(Continued on next wage.)

PIMPLES. SUNBORN, FRECKLES, \
CHAFING. HEAT SPbTS./ITCH, \
PRICKLY HEAT. & INSECT BITES, j
V are oest treated Oy Zam-Bun, \
IfN Summer the skin is made tender by
/excessive perspiration: and the badness
[imprisoned in the tissue, owing to the staggish-
i ness of the pores, is drawn out in the form of
I pimples, rashes, and heat swellings. The strong
air 6t the country or the seaside does not always
J suit the skin of the town dweller, while a change
ofHvater frequently induces a burning irritation
rash that is even more discomforting than sun-
burnt and peeling arms and face, because this irrita-
tion provokes rubbing and scratching* which opens
the way for eczema or some poisoned sore.
The best check to all these skin troubles is the regular use
of Zam-Buk, which is a pure skin-balm, non-irritant, highly anti-
septic and germicidal. The medicinal juices in Zam-Buk naturally
permeate the skin, purify the dust-clogged pores, and purge the skin of
hidden impurities. For removing that tingling irritation known as
Summer Itch, or Prickly Heat, Zam-Buk is invaluable. Zam-Buk
is also highly recommended for taking the sting and smarting out
of insect bites.
PRICKLY HEAT & RASH— Mrs.
Richardson, of First Avenue, St. Peters,
Adelaide, says : “A rash broke out all over
me, which I think was prickly heat, and
[ lumps came out which were very irritable.
\ While this lasted I could get very little rest,
1 but on using Zam-Buk I was very quickly eased of
1 all irritability, and in a short time
Zam-Buk completely cured me.”
Zam-Buk is a proved
remedy for eczema,
bad legs, wounds,
pimples, eruptions,
rash, itch, cuts,
burns, bruises and
other skin troubles.

tensive career. He filled the whole club ot
antiques with excitement and enthusiasm, till the
gold fever fired their withered fibres and whipped
them into renewed energy ; and they confided to
each other what they would do with this stupend-
ous reward, and with the price of the reward
claim (which they would sell to a syndicate), if
the luck of discovery fell to them. Then they
interviewed the storekeeper, and when he refused
to trust them with a month’s rations and new
tools their enthusiasm slumped, and with the re-
flection that such wealth was not for them, they
went back to their old routine.
Ben firmly believed there was gold in the
neighborhood. Often he would stop in his peram-
bulations and look towards the scrub.
“ There’s gold in that there mallee,” he would
mutter, shaking a trembling finger at the bush.
“ I know there is.” And, after a long pause, lie
would add : “ But dang me if I know where.”
And he never looked. Like the other patri-
archs, he concluded that prospecting on an exten-
sive scale was beyond him now, and he just
waited for something to turn up.
It turned up!
* * * *
He was sitting in the bar one night, smoking
and dreaming, when Rocky’s little girl passed
through with something in her hand that glittered
when the light fell on it. She took it to her father
in the next room. Ben watched through the half-
opened door, alert as a basking adder.
“Look dad, what I found! Yaller stone.
Aint it pretty ? ”
Rocky’s face brightened. His wife peered over
his shoulder.
“Goodness, dad, it’s gold, ain’t it?’’
“ Three ounce slug ! ” said Rocky, weighing it
in his hand. “ Where did yer get it, Midgy ? ”
“ In the mallee,” the child replied.
“Ah ! ” said Ben under his breath. “ Didn’t I
say so ! Didn’t I know it! ”
Rocky’s wife grasped his wrist and whispered :
“ Don’t let old Ben hear of it. Get a right for the
groom to peg out for yer, an’ we’ll see his miser-
able old heart break.” She peered cautiously into
the bar. But Ben wasn’t looking. He was
asleep.
Ben always drank with the flies, when he drank
at all, and frequently he questioned the quality
and the measure of the which brought down
a shower of abuse upon his head from Rocky. So
they thought a lot of each other in a perverse
way.
Rocky and Midgy returned from the mallee
next morning in high glee, having located the
find without difficulty. The groom bought a
miner’s right and a kit of tools, and they spent
the day getting things ready. His wife ordered
Seven new dresses on the strength of it. She ex-
pected a big rush shortly, and, of course, she
tnust be prepared when the old town felt the first
galvanic shock of awakening life.
Rocky started for the mallee at dawn, carrying
a flask of whisky with which to christen the claim.
He would call it the “Midgy Roberts.” The
groom, who was a distant relation, carried the
tools. Rocky waxed generous as he drew near.
“In about a month, Tom,” he said, “ I expect
t’ ’ave all I want out o’ this claim, an’ you can
’ave the rest. You can ’ave th’ pub, too, Tom,
an’ the grey mare an’ old Nanny an’ th’ sow ” ——
; He stopped short and dropped the whisky. The
flask broke, and at the same time the groom ex-
claimed : “ The Murray Barge ! ” The claim was
christened.
In the centre of a little square, which Rocky
had cleared, stood Bendigo, leaning on a shovel
and wet with perspiration. He had been work-
ing hard.
“What dirty trick is this?” gasped the publi-
can. “You miserable old fraud! What d’ yer
mean by jumpin’ my "laim ? ”
“Your claim?” cried Bendigo, surprised.
“ Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Roberts, that you
• knowed of this ’ere ? ”
“I found it!” Rocky shrieked. “D —-—you,
you know I did.”
“ No, Rocky. Them’s my pegs, and what’s in-
side ’em's mine. An’ I hope you’ll remember that
trifle o’ fifty quid. Rocky. You’re tryin’ to do a
shuffle now, which I never thought as you
would ”
“ I’ll screw your cursed neck ! ” roared Rocky.
“ Be off ! ”
Ben raised his shovel. “You step inside o’
them pegs an’ your ’ead gets this —sorry though
I’d be to ’urt yer. Go back to yer bar, Rocky.
That sort o’ bluff ain’t the proper thing in a biz-
ness man. If it got about as you tried to cheat
an old man out of his just reward, I’ll lay it
wouldn’t do you no good, Rocky. You’d be done
for in Narraburra.”
Rocky saw he was beaten, and departed with-
out any further argument. But he left the
groom to prospect around the Barge and keep an
eye on him.
That evening, Ben, good-naturedly overlooking
the little unpleasantness of the morning, dropped
in to give him good cheer.
“ Have a drink with me, Rocky,” he said.
“ ’Tain’t often I shout, but I’ve struck it rich
this time.”
“I hope it strikes you blind, you dog,”
growled Rocky. “’Twon’t do you any good,
mark me. I’ll see you beggin’ yet.”
“ Don’t you fret, Rocky. There’s whips o’
gold in the mallee. An’ I always said there was.
I knew.”
Some mornings later Ben came rushing to the
local constable with the news that Rocky was lying
dead in his shaft, but the local constable merely
muttered, Got-’em-again,” and walked away.
The Chows and grizzled fossickers went out,
doubting. But Rocky was there, with a pick and
shovel and a bull’s-eye lantern lying near. He
had tumbled into the shaft and struck his head
on the edge of a shovel which Ben had left stand-
ing in the corner.
“Yer see, mates, he was always hankerin’
round arter this claim o’ mine ; seemed to think
he ’ad a better right to it, somehow,” said Ben to
the wondering group around him. “ An’ he
pegged out ’ere arter all! ”

Getting His Own Back.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
r¥l HE man with his back planted against
' I ' , , ~ , ... tt„
the wall has probably seen better days. He
wears a black coat, which is greasy in front
and shiny behind. He also wears a collar. The
collar is not clean, and is very limp; but it is a
clear pretension to some respectab.l.ty. Indeed,
, , i .11 i i *. a
if the man had told you he once kept a secon -
hand shop, you might believe him.
His fat eyes rove over the passing fashion,
lingering longest on the ladies, especially those
who are young, and in this he seems to get the
J .
utmost satisfaction.
But suddenly fi change of expression over-
shadows his greasy face. His eyes meet those of
a man who has never seen better days, and the
change that comes over him is electrical. In fact,
he starts into sudden motion, and begins to walk
off rapidly. That is to say, his' movements are
rapid but his progress is. very slow. The man
can’t take a step of six inches.
And the man who has never seen better days
starts in pursuit—the pursuit of a snail.
It is a terrible position for the man who has
probably seen better days. There is no possible
escape, but his coolness does not desert him. He
puts on the manner of one who is full of business,
and even makes a pretence of whistling “ Let Me
Like a Soldier Fall.”
The man in pursuit is joined by another man,
who also, unmistakably, has never seen better
days.
“ What’s up, Nipper?”
“You remember the bloke I told you about
last Chewsdav four weeks ? ”
“ Wot bloke ? ”
“The bloke wot I said I would get me own
back from if I waited 10 years.”
“Yes.”
“ Well, this is him.”
“ He’s a funny-lookin’ cove,” said the second
vagrant, critically.
“ Funny ! Funny’s no name for it. Jest step
alongside of him en’ look at ’im sideways.”
“ Wot’s wrong with ’is legs?”
“Dunno. He wasn’t like that w’en I saw him
last. P’raps the Lord put a judgment on him for
wot ’e did ter me.”
The man who has probably seen better days
tries to walk on unconcernedly, but fails. He
tries to walk more rapidly, but he has to pull up
at the kerb and negotiate it as if it were a wall.
It is a difficult undertaking, and to make matters
worse the man called Nipper jostles him.
“ Thought I wouldn’t know yer again, eh ?”
“You are makin’ a mistake, me friend.”
“ Not a bit of it. Couldn’t do it unless yer put
yer face under a steam roller ter make yerself
better lookin’.”
“It must er bin some other man, not me. Be-
sides, I never go into that pub.”
“Oh, it wuz you orlright.”
“Wot’s the matter, Nipper?” asks a third
vagrant.
“I knowed yer soon as I spotted yer loanin’
against the wall,” says Nipper to his quarry.
“Stoush him, Nipper,” suggests the second
vagrant.
“Wot’s the matter, Nipper?” asks a fourth
vagrant, coming along.
“It would do me good to stoush ’im, en I’m
just dyin’ ter sail into the cow,” says Nipper.
“ But there’s plenty time yet.”
The man with some semblance of respectability
wobbles on, and four nondescripts creep along
behind, surveying him with solemn, serious eyes,
and the man looks ashamed of his following.
“I likes blokes like you,” says Nipper, hanging
over his shoulder. “Yes, yer takes the bun with
yer boiled shirts en’ wearin’ of collars, and all the
time ye’re a vulture in lamb’s wool goin’ round
lookin’ for what belongs to other blokes ter pinch.
Do yer call yerself a man ? ”
“ Wot’s the matter, Nipper ? ” asks yet another
waif.
“It’s a good job for you I ’aven’t brought me
revolver with me,” exclaims Nipper vehemently.
He begins to chew his moustache.
“Do you know wot I would do if I’d brought
me revolver with me ? ” he asks fiercely.
But the semi-respectable man only shuffles along
with extra energy. “ I’d shoot yer, that’s wot I’d
do.”
Still 'another addition to the party turns up
with the query : “ Wot’s up, Nipper?”
“ S’pose they’d hang me for shootin’ yer, but
I’d only be doin’ other blokes a good turn. There
ought ter be a lor against blokes like you gettin’
born. I don’t know wot Parleyment wuz thinkin’
of ter let yer.” And he plants himself against
his victim and looks at him sideways. About 10
interested vagabonds slowly follow in the rear.
And Nipper’s face looks desperately vindictive.
“You’re not a man ! Do you know wot yer
are?”
Not a word from the man who might possibly at
one time have seen better days.
“Ye’re a dog,” he adds, after a long stare, and
after letting that soak in, he says, “A dog wot
you can’t tell wot sort of breed is in him, and
that’s the worst sort of dog.”
Then he stands off and surveys him, biting his
thumbnail the'while.
“Give ’im a woodener, Nipper,” cries a voice
from the body of vagrants behind.
“Yes, let the old bloke stop one,” says another.
A wave of enthusiasm is gradually creeping
over the mob.
“Wot’s up, Nipper?” asks a vagrant just
arrived.
“Oh, I’ll deal with ’im directly, you believe
me. I just want ter tell ’im wot I think of ’im
first.”
The patience of the slightly-respectable indi-
vidual is becoming exhausted.
“ The p’leece is never about w’en they’re
wanted,” he says. “Somebody ought to write
ter the papers about it.”
“Wearin’ boiled shirts en collars, it fair makes
me sick,” exclaims Nipper. “ It’s only the sheep’s
clothes wot the roarin’ lion wears w’en he’s lookin’
round ter take down other blokes. Yer thinks
blokes thinks you wouldn’t do such things.”
At this moment another ruin thrusts himself
through the slow procession, and says masterfully :
“Wot’s all the row about, Nipper? ”
“ Yer remember the bloke I told yer about last
Chewsday four weeks ago.”
“Wot bloke ? ”
“ The bloke wot drank me beer when I turned
round ter get a sausage-roll. Well, this is him-”
A horrified groan pulsates among the crowd.
“ W’y didn’t yer stiffen ’im ? ”
“I didn’t ’ave time. He could walk faster
then than he can now.”
“ I didn’t ’ave the same trouble then,” says the
questionably respectable man. “And, ennyvvays,
it wasn’t me. It must ’ave been another man.”
An ominous growl is going on among the mob.
They have been collecting much the same as dogs
do when there is anything of dog-interest about.
And this is a matter which touches them closely.
What has occurred to Nipper might happen to
every one of them. It is easily done while their
attention is distracted at the counter lunch.
There is no knowing what might occur to the
beer-snatcher only a voice breaks like a bomb
among the mob. *
“Now then, you men, I call upon you to dis-
perse in small quantities-.”
And the mob melts silently away. Only the
man whose respectability you might have doubts
of remains. ‘
“ Didn’t you hear what I said ?” thunders the
constable. “ Disperse, and be quick about it.”
The man looks distressful.
“I can’t, Sergeant,” he says; “I’ve got the
rheumatics very bad.”

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when ahy
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Appplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. vThe
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.
