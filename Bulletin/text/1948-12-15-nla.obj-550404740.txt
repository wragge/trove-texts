GLOUCESTER, which possesses one
of the most beautiful cathedrals in
England, also has one of the oldest inns,
paradoxically called “The New Inn,”
although it is centuries older than any of
the other hotels in the city.
The visitor walking under the archway
shown in this picture passes from twen-
tieth-century commerce into Shake-
spearian England. Here the great man of
letters is reputed to have produced some
of his own plays, the audience leaning
over the creepered balconies that extend
around three sides of the courtyard to
look down on the players below.
Outside and inside, the New Inn re-
tains the original remains of that
fifteenth-century building so beloved by
monks and pilgrims. It is recorded that
when Mary succeeded to the throne
(1553) upon the death of her brother,
Edward VI, this important event was
publicly made known at the “Newe
Inne,” there being great celebrations
“upon Sir John Bridges, knyght and
dyverse other knyghts and gentilmen and
yeomen with hym commying to pro-
clayme the Quenes highness in Glou-
cester”, ...
Today guests at the New Inn can
enjoy the old-world atmosphere of the
many nooks and quiet corners of this
ancient hostel of our forefathers and
capture something of the original scene
of Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims. The
visitor will appreciate how modern im-
provements have been carried out with-
out in any way interfering with the many
beautiful items of artistic worth and' all
the signs and tokens of ancient living.
Hall, stairway, lounges and other
rooms have the centuries-old beams and
oaken panels which lend charm and
atmosphere to the building. Everywhere
the furniture and decorations have been
carefully chosen to harmonise with the
character of the place. Through the
centuries time has marched on, but she
has been kind to the New Inn of
Gloucester.

MARY GILMORE'S
Like Wordsworth and like Walt Whit-
man, with whom, in her degree, she
shares largeness of mind and staunchness
of heart, Mary Gilmore has written a
great deal of inferior poetry. Some of it is
in her Selected Verse (Angus and
Robertson); much of, it remains hidden
in the nine books of poems she has pub-
lished over the years; and very much
more, one suspects, lies awaiting the re-
searches of scholars in old trunks or iron-
bound chests—whenever the poet may
have stored the poems which she herself
thought were too erratic to print.
The faults must be discussed, for the
first thing one wishes to know about any
writer is his or her quality purely as an
artist. But there is no profit in dwelling
long upon the lapses in Selected Verse.
They are simple and obvious and —in-
dicating perhaps the confines of Mary
Gilmore’s thought and vision rather than
her virtues as a disciplinarian—they do
not descend into the ludicrous like the
errors of Wordsworth and Whitman.
Anyone who has himself labored in the
craft of verse may indulge in a
sympathetic smile at a few odd or
archaic words dragged in by the
hair of their heads when the poet
was desperate for a rhyme—-if a
“steven” is the prow of a ship and
an “eagre” is a tidal bore, what on earth
are a “pyot” and a “wift”? —but that,
beside the feats of bathos of which her
two great forerunners were capable, is
nothing. It is sufficient to say that the
faults, generally, are the failure to finish
a poem —like Shaw Neilson, Mary Gil-
more too often repeats her first stanza
for her conclusion —and the writer’s habit
of running wild and loose
in a kind of “free verse”
that is simply not poetry.
It is more profitable, as
well as more pleasing, to
turn to the merits of the
verse. Whitman, who wrote
little that could strictly be
called poetry, except the
lament for Lincoln and, per-
haps, “Out of the Cradle
Endlessly Rocking” who
knows anything of Whit-
man’s by heart ? —was a
special case in the history of
literature: he spoke for a
continent, he broke up the
structure of the language for
later writers to mould into
new rhythms and to shape
into' new patterns.
generally and obviously, no
poet makes a reputation
merely by writing large
quantities of bad verse.
Considerations other than
technical may come into the
final assessment; but, first,
the pure quality of the
poetry, Wordsworth lives
not by his rubbish but by
the passages of splendor in
the long poems, by the majesty of the
ode on immortality, by perfect sonnets
and by lyrics that ran down the crags
of his genius as sweet as mountain
streams.
Selected Verse does not fully do
justice to Mary Gilmore as an artist.
Where is “The Pear Tree” from Aus-
tralian Poetry, 1941 ? Where is “Nation-
ality” from Australian Poetry, 1942 ?
These omissions, presumably, are covered
by the explanation in Robert D. Fitz-
Gerald’s foreword that Mary Gilmore has
a new volume awaiting print. Fitz-
Gerald also explains that the selection
(made by himself, T. Inglis Moore and
Mary Gilmore in collaboration for the
Commonwealth Fund) has been de-
signed to present Mary Gilmore
as a personality, in all her diversity,
rather than exclusively as a poet; which
suggests that good poems may have been
left in the nine earlier books, to allow
faulty—but personally interesting—verses
to be printed in the present selection.
Whether such a principle is altogether
desirable —or desirable at the present
time, when Mary Gilmore’s personality
may very likely be more widely known
than her poetry —is debatable. One of
Matthew Arnold’s objections to making
a selection from Wordsworth’s poetry—
that so much of his best work was buried
among the masses of the long poems and
could not be torn from its context without
losing in weight—does not apply to Mary
Gilmore’s verses, where there is nothing
of very great length. A selection on
purely artistic principles could readily be
made, and it would make a very fine
book.
Four of the five poems in Selected
Verse about black swans —of which only
“Swans at Night” reaches the heights at
which the poet has aimed (though there
are, indeed, some lovely lines about the
white swan in “A Song of Swans”) —might
at least have been omitted, to be replaced
by something better. The poems about
aboriginals, equally repetitive, might
have been thinned-out. And though it
may add a little to one’s conception of
Mary Gilmore as a personality to learn
that she wrote the same poem twice (with
only minor alterations in the second ver-
sion), the inclusion of both “Coronation
Anthem, 1937” and “Edwardian Corona-
tion Anthem” —especially when both
versions are of very slight intrinsic poetic
merit —was surely a mistake.
These are, however, minor matters. On
the larger question, it is true that Mary
Gilmore is both a poet and a personality,
and that, in the final assessment of her
work, the two blend to become one
literary statement. The strangely mixed
assortment of poetic values in Selected
Verse is, therefore, justifiable ; and there
are enough poems to make the book stand
firmly—now and tomorrow —as pure
poetry, not needing the reinforcement of
the poet’s personality.
The book opens with an ode in
memory of dead soldiers, “These Fellow-
ing Men.” Instantly one of the distin-
guishing qualities of Mary Gilmore’s
poetry makes itself apparent: the wild
thought that comes flying to her from
the depths, from outer space ; coming, so
it seems, in perfect clarity despite its pro-
fundity ; and so, simple and profound,
set down:
Blow, bugles, blow; we are but sounds
Blown on a world of blood and wounds.
Two pages further on, in the midst of
the same ode, there is the homelier note
of pathos, a touch of pastoral charm and,
once again, the grace of a perfect sim-
plicity :
O sweet, O young, Q unaccounted Dead!
Grass shall be green above your head,
Though only the bee shall find your bed,
And whisper, whisper as he goes,
“Here doth he lie whom no man knows.”
No other long poem in Selected Verse
is carried through with the practically
unfaltering music of “These Fellowing
Men.” It is the flashes among the long
poems, the fragments everywhere and the
occasional short poems perfect in their
brevity, that sustain the high note of
poetry through the book. The last
stanza of “Inheritance”:
Three lines at the end of a poem dedi-
cated to the author’s father:
I have seen names, long praised, flung out as
naught; ■ „ .
And I have seen one, whom the world called
poor,
Walking amid the mountains of his thought.
The picture of the white swan among the
migrating black swans:
And saw the snowy-breasted wanderer, gleaming
white, , , .
Lace in and out the host, and go with that
great flight.
The stanzas from “Swans at Night” where
Mary Gilmore at last found out exactly
what she wanted to say on one of her
favorite themes:
Within the night, above the dark,
I heard a host upon the air,
Upon the void they made no mark,
For all that they went sailing there.
And from that host there came a cry,
A note of calling strange and high;
I heard it blown against the sky
Till naught there seemed but it and 1.
The pastel shades of twilight and the
gently feminine vision of the earths
loveliness in “The Undelivered” —one of
the short poems without a blemish:
As the soft gloaming fell,
And the flowers closed their eyes, •
As homeward the last late bird
Blackened against the skies.
As the thin cloud of eve ,
Frittered away in laces —
While yet a faint light veiled
The woods and shadowy places,
I stood as one to whom, as a dream,
An old memory clung;
And suddenly I heard the yoes
That wait for their young.
The first stanza of “The Bush Born
Child,” setting the vastness of Australia
round the solitary figures of a mother
and child:
My mother’s terrors wake in me.
And all her fears are mine;
She was so young where silence lay,
Round her small world, like some great sea
Which no man’s measure might define!
The kettledrum in “Lest We Forget”
which, calling the dead to march again,
seemed as if it beat in
An empty, hollow and echoing street
Like some lone place in the heart of a man.
The picture of “Legislators,” men of
power and importance,* suddenly per-
ceived to be
fellow men, no more
Than we who give them power
To stand upon a storied floor
And flourish for an hour.
Winds out of far eternities
Beat on us as we go;
Fallen are those, and risen these,
And that is all we know.
The lines on vanished beauty in “Silk
of the Sunlight,” not so deep, not so real
as most of Mary Gilmore’s poems on
death, without the unbearable pathos of
“Killed in the Street,” but still beautifully
written:
Gold of her hair, and
Rose of her skin,
Out of the darkness
Come no more in.
The mad, delightful, tempestuously
defiant little poem—with its roots in
Scottish balladry—about “The Rook, the
Raven and the Chough”;
I have wept long enough I
Now, let me sing
The rook, the raven and the chough,
And the bold black wing.
The high and tragic music of love in
“The Plover”:
Above life’s darkling field,
Moves, in unending flight,
Grief that may not be healed,
To weep upon the night;
Therefore as time runs by,
Love still must call the lover —
The bird’s cry is my cry,
My heart the plover.
The lines about ploughing in “Wonder,”
imperfectly written yet effectively setting
down an image of the great rhythms of
the earth:
O as a child, how often have I stood
And watched a turning furrow, beauty spelled I
That rhythm, that curve of moving earth that
felled . ,
In endless seam upon the narrowing rood.
Not e’en the sea itself has me so held,
So to my heart brought full beatitude.
The odd, enchanting, powerful poem—
again short and completely successful—in
which the last of the gods, alone in a
cave, symbolises the earth seeking re-
assurance from the sea, all life seeking re-
assurance from the eternal rhythms of
the universe:
And in his fear he wept, then, like a child
That in the dark puts out its hand toward
Its mother’s face, he waked and sought the sea.
And as his pulses hammered heart and brain,
He heard the great slow-moving tongue
Of ocean lick upon the shore ;
And so, returning to his place,
He slept again.
The best of the aboriginal poems,
“Boolee, the Bringer of Life”:
O Boolee, woman and man!
O Boolee, terror and flame!
Yea against Nay in the night,
Out of the whirlwind I came.
The gay portrait of old Sir Henry Parkes
—even if it appears to derive from Vachel
Lindsay on General William Booth, and
if “barrage” is not altogether a satis-
factory rhyme for “carriage” :
His hand on the rein,
His foot on the thill.
His eyes like a spark,
His tongue like a whip,
His leonine head,
His hair like a mat,
And his big top hat,
Coming down the hill,
Coming down the street,
Coming into Sydney
In his old borrowed carnage!
“The House of Hourne,” in which, if
exactly what happens is not quite clear,
it is* again abundantly apparent that one
of Mary Gilmore’s ancestors must have
been a minstrel of the Border and that,
down the years, the balladist has not for-
gotten his precision of language and
purity of line:
Again crowed out the bristling cock;
His clarion went so far
It seemed as though he called the moon.
Or cried upon a star.
The exquisite landscape from “The Dis-
inherited” :
All night the frost needled the air,
Or netted on the grass
Its silver points
Of shining glass
And all night long the moon moved like
A white thought in the mind
And, to conclude this necessarily incom-
plete survey of the purely artistic merits
of Selected Verse , the eight lines of “The
Tenancy,” as pellucid, as dignified and
as challenging as the later poetry of
Yeats, and typical of Mary Gilmore’s
spirit as well as of her work at its best:
I shall go as my father went,
A thousand plans in his mind,
With something still unspent,
When death let fall the bimd.
I shall go as my mother went.
The ink still wet on the line;
I shall pay no rust as rent
For the house that is mine.
Mary Gilmore, then, is a poet—and a
distinguished one —as well as a person-
ality. Her Virtues of technique, when
her technique is virtuous, are those of
simplicity, clarity and precision. Her
vision is of the warmth of humanity and
the coldness of space. Her theme is the
drama of man amidst the wonder and
terror of the universe. Her message is of
courage.
After her right to stand among poets as
a poet has been established one must take
into consideration for the final assessment
that reinforcement of her art which is
provided by her personality and by a
comparatively large output. She has pub-
lished nine books of verse ; a tenth awaits
the printer. She has published four books
of prose ; and-—whatever one is to make
of The Worker Cook Book among the
productions of a poet — Old Days: Old
Ways and More Recollections, her two
volumes of reminiscences, were brimming
with Australian life, of lasting importance
from the historical viewpoint and capti-
vating in their prose style.
Mary Gilmore is more than a writer
who has turned out a reasonable number
of books. Through her country child-
hood, her youthful adventures in the fan-
tastic Paraguayan experiment of William
Lane, and her later life in Sydney as a
fighter for liberty, a champion of the
oppressed —whether they are black swans
or black men —and as a patron of the
arts, circumstance and her temperament
have made her a kind of living epitome
of her period, an embodiment of the
Australian spirit in its finest flowering.
In her poetry, this spiritual identifica-
tion of the poet with her native land has
become conscious and intellectualised.
Whether from deliberate purpose—a high
sense of duty—or from unconscious
dictate, or, as is most likely, from an in-
extricable merging of the two, Mary
Gilmore has constituted herself an un-
official Poet Laureate of Australia. This
has not always been to her advantage as
an artist. Poets, except Tennyson with
his supreme mastery of technique, do
not normally write at their best when they
are writing as Poets Laureate. But Mary
Gilmore’s admirable attempts to supply
Australian literature with the ceremonious
poetry it lacks have at least broadened
her range and have strengthened her .posi-
tion as the spokesman of a nation. The
number of significant national incidents—
from Eureka to Gallipoli —mentioned in
Selected Verse is astounding ; and still
more so is the number of significant Aus-
tralians from Kendall to Norman
Lindsay—mentioned by name.
Thus, then, does Mary Gilmore stand
among the present generation: as a poet,
and as an embodiment of her country;
as a writer of lyrics and ballads, and as
a legend. And she is a woman. The
theory, widely enough held, that the
highest reach of feminine endeavor in
the arts must inevitably fall short of the
highest masculine achievements is neither
courteous nor proveable: all things are
possible to genius. But still, remembering
how few women poets have written as
deeply and as strongly as Mary Gilmore,
her accomplishment is indeed remarkable.
And, one must add, it may be compared
with Wordsworth’s or with Whitman s m
kind but not in degree. Mary Gilmore
does not break new ground technically
as did Whitman, nor has she his breadtn.
She has effected no revolution in style
and subject-matter as did Wordsworth,
she has not in full measure his grandeur
of vision and expression. But she is or
their kind, poets of humanity, those or
the erratic talent and the great soul.
What the future will make of her as a
legend it is not easy to prophesy.
One thing is certain: the best ot
her poetry does not date.
influences upon it —“The Rmger i
Paterson’s “Clancy”—are negligible. it
is too sincere to be merely clever, to
profound to be obscure, too proud to
follow fashion. It will read as finely m
a hundred years as it does today, o.

Does the idiot stand
With his idle grin
Because no ancestor
Lives in him?

(1) Is the water in all artesian bores
hot? (2) Why?
(1) All artesian waters are either
hot or warm. (2) The heat of the
earth’s interior imparts its heat to
the water-beds. In Queensland the
average increase in temperature is
from Ideg. F. for every 40ft. in the
south to Ideg. F. in 20ft. in the
north.

How is iron galvanised ?
The iron is pickled for six to eight
hours in water containing 1 p.c. sul-
phuric acid, and then washed and
kept immersed in clean water in which
a little fresh burnt lime has been
stirred. It is then immersed in
chloride of zinc for one or two
minutes until a skin of fine bubbles
has formed on the surface, dried
on a heated iron plate and dipped
in a bath of molten zinc (not glow-
ing) until the metal acquires the tem-
perature of- the zinc bath. The sur-
face of the zinc is protected by sal-
ammoniac.

How did the word “bushranger”
come into use in Australia ?
It apparently had its birth in Tas-
mania. Food was supplied to the
first Tasmanian convict settlements
from Sydney. Floods and droughts
periodically interrupted supplies, and
convicts in these times of famine were
released to range the bush and pro-
cure food for themselves.

Can native flora shrubs and plants
be grown in suburban areas? Suit-
able varieties and soil treatment?
Provided care and attention are given
in the preparation of soil, beds and
boxes, many native flora are worth
a trial. They are not suitable to be
grown among annuals where con-
tinual watering is the rule; under
normal conditions dryness is an asset.
Drainage is most important, and the
soil should contain plenty of charcoal,
gravel and coarse sand, topped off
with a dressing of bush or black soil.
Beds built up 6in. higher than sur-
rounding paths will help towards
better drainage. Native flora which
can be grown include boronias,
waratah, flannel-flower, grevillea,
Christrnas-bush and -bells, callistemon
(bottle-brush), leptospermum (tea-
tree), chorizema (pea-like flowers),
Geraldton wax, and clianthus Dam-
pierii (Sturt’s desert pea).

SOUTH WITH HURLEY.
Frank Hurley’s Shackleton’s Argonauts
(Angus and Robertson) adds a good deal
more than one might expect to the
record of the 1914 Trans-Antarctic Ex-
pedition, which has already been de-
scribed by Worsley, commander of the
Endurance, and by Shackleton himself.
Hurley, who was Shackleton’s photo-
grapher, might be thought to have con-
tributed enough by the set of magnifi-
cent photographs reproduced at the end
of his book; one of which, with the
caption “Like a ghost-ship etched against
the blackness of the Antarctic night: a
flashlight study of the Endurance, with
her hull and rigging encrusted with glitter-
ing rime-crystals,” is a thing of extra-
ordinary beauty, and, considering the cir-
cumstances under which it was taken—
the ship awaiting her death among the
ice-floes in which she was trapped— must
be one of the most dramatic photographs
ever made.
This photograph, as it happens, has
been reproduced before —in Shackleton’s
narrative —as have some of the others,
including the peculiar composite draw-
ings and photographs (not labelled as
such in this volume) of the ship’s boats
drawn up to an ice-floe for the night and
of Shackleton’s landing with Worsley,
Crean and the others after the great open-
boat voyage nine hundred miles across
the Antarctic from Elephant Island to
South Georgia.
But other photographs—a picture of
sea-elephants among the tussocks against
a background of the bleak South Geor-
gian mountains; a shot of a whale being
harpooned; a colony of thousands of
penguins looking (except for the glacier
behind them) remarkably like a crowd at
Randwick; a beautiful study of a
smaller group of penguins against the ice-
barrier topped by masses of clouds
rimmed with the light of the midnight
sun ; and a stark impression of the En-
durance overshadowed by the white cliffs
of an iceberg, with the caption “A mighty
iceberg ploughed its way through the
pack and bore down upon the imprisoned
ship: we were saved by a miracle: a
blizzard came and deflected the berg from
its course” —have not, so far as the pre-
sent reviewer knows, previously been re-
produced in book form.
Hurley adds to these, first, some very
ne P atc^es °f prose. It is a fact, strange
when one first encounters it, that nearly
all writers on the Antarctic, from Scott
to have turned out volumes
that could stand as minor classics of
English prose as well as major classics
0 f exploration. The explanation is not
really so mysterious. It is simply that,
when they are writing of tremendous
drama amidst fantastic and beautiful
scenery, and writing from deep per-
sonal experience, the style rises of its
C w’n accord to match the great theme.
Hurley, one would judge from his light-
hearted opening chapters, is normally no
prose stylist. But in Shakletoris Argo-
mats, when the spirit moves him, he can
write with splendid effectiveness:
It was sixteen months since we had seen
rock and walked on it at South Georgia,
Oh, blessed memory ! Late in the afternoon
a g f° up P eaks loomed up to the
north-west, which our charts indicated to
be Elephant Island. Elephant and Clarence
Islands were the last outposts of Antarctica,
Between them the sea rolled as through a
broad portal, and, if we failed to land on
one of them, we would be swept through
into the tempestuous spaces of the open
ocean. We were indeed the forlorn play-
things of colossal forces.
* *TSS; °o
precariously was appalling and terrifying,
The swells of the ocean now came surging
through the ice-fields from the north, in
great undulations, from horizon to horizon,
The fj oes b ent un der the heave, yet no
open water was visible. When exceptionally
violent swells reached the centre of the
floes, they splintered like sheets of glass,
and then, as the fragments drew apart, the
inky waters showed through. A few
moments later, the fractured pieces would
batter and grind in *° one another, adjust-
ing their new shapes to the oncoming waves.
....The battering impact of the floes and
the dread of the ice splitting beneath our
tents and letting us drop through into the
s f a was ever with us. We sat up in our
Sleeping-bags, fully dressed, shivering
through the long nights, waiting for the
dawn. Haggard faces and dulled eyes told
a painful story of fatigue and anxiety.
It is, of course, not possible for any
writer after Shackleton and Worsley to
add much to the general outline of the
story; the same set of facts—the ship’s
imprisonment and destruction in the ice,
the six-months’ life on a drifting floe, the
voyage in open boats to Elephant Island,
the trials of the marooned men and
Shackleton’s journey in the James Caird
to South Georgia—belong to all three
writers.
Hurley, who was left on Elephant
Island, could tell us more about that
period of desperate patience than
Shackleton and Worsley, who were away
in the James Caird, dealing with the
mountainous Antarctic and then with the
no less formidable mountains of South
Georgia, but here, after recording that
some of the men had become “unhinged
by their agonies”—a state which began on
the last nights of the escape from the
ice and continued for a time on Elephant
Island—the author suffers from that
natural reticence of explorers which (an
error from the historical viewpoint) makes
them disinclined to dwell on any but the
heroic aspects of their adventures. Not,
however, that there could have been any
very violent or prolonged symptoms of
disintegration on Elephant Island: for
Hurley says that only one fight occurred,
and that, soon forgotten in friendship,
was between one of the sailors and him-
self, in a blizzard.
Hurley’s additions to the broad outline
consist of scores of details, unknown to
the other writers or ignored by them.
They might be called minor details ; but
it is in the glimpses of men and the facts
of experience that the life of the expedi-
tion is most richly preserved. The book
opens with a contribution to the curious
anecdotes of mystery, prophecy and the
supernatural which surrounded this ex-
pedition from Worsley’s dream at the
beginning to the celebrated experience of
Shackleton, Worsley and Crean at the
end when, crossing the South Georgian
mountains, each of the three had the
impression that a fourth man was keep-
ing them company. Hurley, too, it
appears—away up in Carpentaria with
Francis Birtles when an aboriginal
brought him a cable from jShackleton—
began his adventure with a dream, more
easily explicable than Worsley's, in which,
when Birtles was shaking his hammock
the following morning, he thought he
was “a castaway on an ice-floe in a surg-
ing sea.”
Hurley, when he read Shackleton's
cable, “jumped for joy.” He is
next to be observed jumping for
joy—and writing a vivid description—
at the spectacle of bull sea-elephants
fighting in the mating season on South
Georgia, He investigates the belly of a
whale and finds that it contains five
barrels of shrimps. Another whale’s
belly provides him with “the mangled
sections of huge tentacles as thick as a
man’s thigh, which must have been torn
from, a giant squid measuring at least
thirty feet across.” Into the belly of a
third whale. Hurley, claiming to be the
only living Jonah, falls headlong and has
to be rescued with ropes and ladders, as
a mountain-climber from an abyss:
except that the abyss was not snowy.
He is modest about his own experi-
ences, but there are one or two incidents
that show the stuff of which Antarctic
photographers are made: when, before
the pack has closed, he is out on a floe
taking views of the Endurance forcing
her way through and is charged by the
ship; and again, later in the book, when
his dog-team suddenly plunges him from
the floes into icy waters likely to be popu-
lated by killer-whales.
There is another contribution to the
expedition’s mystery stories when he
records that the crew of the Endurance
were so convinced that the playing of the
gramophone brought the fury of the
Antarctic upon them that the machine
had to be put away. There is a descrip-
tion of “showers of scintillating gold”
when condensation-crystals, lit by the sun,
fell from a cloudless sky. And, deepen-
ing the heroic picture of Shackleton —-
exuberant as a boy in his happy moods,
as Worsley described him ; tireless and
indomitable in disaster —there is a reveal-
ing glimpse of the agony of responsibility
that lay beneath the mask of fortitude he
presented to his men:
There were nights when, startled by
a cry or a groan, I would rouse him
from a troubled sleep. Sitting up in his
sleeping-bag Sir Ernest would then relate
some horrible dream he had had of the boat
being crushed between floes, the camp being
engulfed, or some other nightmare. Plans
would then be discussed to avoid these
calamities, for he regarded these dreams
as warnings.
More than anything else about the
book one likes the spirit of it. It is a
proud story, and it is proudly told. It is
good that the New Zealander Worsley
(whose brother Lance Worsley, inciden-
tally, spends his time between Sydney and
Newcastle and recently dropped in on
The Bulletin) and the Australian Frank
Hurley had a hand in it. Hurley sums up
finely on the expedition when he says,
recalling the last few days before reach-
ing Elephant Island: “It was amazing
that our spent and weatherbeaten bodies
responded so heroically to the occasion,
and I doubt if any creature but man could
have survived the excesses of exposure,
fatigue, hunger and lack of rest to which
we had been subjected. It was the will
that made it possible—the will that
enabled us to rise above suffering and to
dominate and drive our jaded bodies.”


GUGGA
By
GIORIA
RAWLINSON
LAST winter the doctor said that the
old great-grandfather must never be
left alone at night. That was be-
cause Gugga had fallen down in a
fit of rage after three Maoris had dragged
his boat on to a rock-ledge where he
could not launch it. They had taken
away the anchor and the sails. They
said, “We do this only for your good,
Gugga. You are too old to handle a
boat now, and it is not necessary that
you go fishing. You belong to our family
and we will look after you gladly. If
you like we will sell your boat and give
you the money, and it would please us
if you would leave your cottage and
come to live with us in the village.”
But the old man had shaken his fists
at them, had screamed at them in Maori,
English and Norwegian, and then had
fallen on his face. The doctor said he
nearly had a stroke and asked, “How old
is he?” They did not know. One said
eighty-five, another, over ninety.
< ‘ \ \ J HY is it that we have a Norwegian
“ V great-grandfather when we are
Maoris?” Peter asked his sister Polly.
They carried Gugga’s dinner, and were
to sleep in the cottage to keep him com-
pany, because of a tangi at Pandora,
where the whole village had gone to
weep. There was only their mother left
to prepare an evening meal for their
father and uncle, who were mustering
cattle over the hills. There was, of
course, the pakeha photographer who had
been taking pictures of the mustering—
but somehow he did not count.
Polly, who was two years older than
Peter, kicked the poa and rattail grasses
with her feet as they dawdled down the
track to Gugga’s cottage.
“The pakeha photograph man asked
me what my Norwegian name is. What
did he mean? All our names are Maori
names.”
“He is a Nosey Parker, that one,”
answered Polly. “He asks me questions,
and weir do I know the answers, but I
always say Ido not know. Aunt Ana
Rakuni told me all about everything so
that I can tell my own children in the
days when I have married. It is this
way. Many hundreds of years ago old
Gugga came from Norwegian lands and
married into our family. Ido not know
our whakapapa, so I cannot tell you any-
thing except the name of his beautiful
wife. It was Hereni Paraone, which, in
pakeha, is Helen Browne.”
“But how is it that she had a pakeha
name? Helen Browne is a pakeha name,
isn’t it?”
“Well, yes. But don’t be a fool, Peter.
It must have been some other pakeha
that married into her family—l don’t
know. Well, old Gugga and his wife
Helen had two girls, which must have
been upsetting. Then one day, one dark
and rainy day this Helen, this wife of
Gugga’s, our great-grandmother, went to
Te Reinga—and never came back. She
went into the dark water inside the cave
of spirits and she never came back.”
ED ETER shuddered. “If you frighten
* t me, I’ll tell on you.”
“Well, I was speaking about their two
daughters who got married and had a
lot of children who also got married
and so on. But isn’t it sad now for
Gugga, all alone except for Mum and
Dad and the uncles to look after him?”
“I don’t like about her going over Te
Reinga—l don’t like that place. You
are not to speak of it.”
“All good people go over Te Reinga.
That is where the spirits live. That is
why this place is called Spirits Bay. This
place is full of them —and old bones,
too.”
Once again Peter shivered—then tried
to change the subject. “It will be fun
tonight if he makes pancakes and funny
faces and sings. I don’t like it when he
screams and swears.”
“Gugga wouldn’t hurt a skinny flea—
although he’s as mad as a weka. You are
afraid. You will begin to howl soon. I
am never afraid, never, not of spirits or
old bones or voices in the night. But I
hope he is funny; it is better when he
makes us laugh.”
“Funny” meant like the time when
Gugga gutted the fish and then tried to
get his foot into it, and put his old
slipper in the frying-pan—or when he
got out a bottle of what he called Norge
wine that tasted like carraway-seeds and
made the old man sing lustily.
THE photographer came down a scrub-
covered hill towards the children. He
looked tired and hot and cross. He
tried to hurry, but there was native
dodder among the grass which tripped
him up if he took his mind off his feet
for a few minutes.
“Hullo, kids!”
“Hullo,” answered Polly, who, for a
Maori child, was surprisingly talkative
with strangers, “You are to have your
kai with Mum and Dad and Uncle
James. We are going to stay with Gugga
tonight.”
“Aren’t you scared to be there alone
with the old man?”
“Peter is—l’m not. This is only the
third time we have stayed alone with
him and nothing happened before.” She
decided to give the man a trifle to think
about, and added, “Gugga was the hus-
band of my great-grandmother Helen
Browne.”
“You stagger me, honestly.” He
laughed. “He doesn’t look as though he
had ever been young enough to be a
husband. What do you two poor kids
do with yourselves all day in this lonely
hole?”
“We eat and play and, of course, I
go ten miles to school on week days. I
ride behind my cousin Johnny—it is fun.
Did you make some pictures of the
cattle?”
“I did, and I hope I’m
never sent on a job like this
again. I also got some pic-
tures of Te Reinga.”
Peter picked up the
thermos - flas'k that held
Gugga’s tea and ran down
the track.
Polly giggled. “He’s scared
of that name, Te Reinga.
Will you show them to me
tomorrow?”
“If you are awake when I
leave. The sooner I get away
from this dead-and-alive place
the better. Goodbye, Polly.”
Polly caught up with her
brother and kicked at his
ankles. “You porker, you,
being rude like that to a
gentleman! Don’t you have
any manners? You should
have said ‘Excuse me, Mister,
I must be going now’ or ‘Pardon me for
hurrying away, but my great-grandfather
waits for his dinner.’ ”
UGGA’S home was two miles from
the village in a lonely place, on the
sheltered side of a cliff. The children
liked his living-room, but to most people
it would have suggested a torture-
chamber with chains and ropes and pul-
leys hanging on the walls, gadgets and old
iron strewn on the floor.
Gugga slept on a shelf over the table,
a handy arrangement that enabled him
to stay in bed when it rained and just
reach out a hand for something to eat
or drink. Only a sm9ll corner of the
table was reserved for his meals ; the rest
was covered with bits of wood, shells,
stones and papers, which encroached on
the corner in spite of a temporary dam
formed by ail old gumboot.
He had some household gods—a very
large lump of kauri-gum with three in-
sects embedded in it, a Maori Bible with
“To my brother in Christ from the Rev.
Heme Tamahana,” and a wax model of
fruit and flowers on a little table near
the window. This was only partly
covered with broken glass, and of a
generally dilapidated appearance—-the
faded roses had guttered down upon the
pears and the grapes had seceded from
their stalks and amalgamated themselves
in an unnatural union with the petals of
daisies. There was a card under the glass
with faded writing, “Wishing Dear Helen
and Olaf health, wealth and prosperity,
from Mr. and Mrs. Yates, Parengarenga.”
Gugga ate his dinner and drank his
tea without seeming to notice the
children. Outside the bay lay darkening
in the shadow of the hills ; the sky was
spread with feathery wisps, and the light
was pale and strangely transparent. The
wind blew over from the sea and the
windows in the little cottage rattled.
Peter looked apprehensively at Polly.
Suddenly Gugga exclaimed in a loud
voice, “Tak for maden!” and drank from
a queer-shaped bottle.
“Are those Norwegian speaking
words?” asked Polly.
“Trondhjeim, that’s where I come
from, I thanked you for the meal, that
was all. Look at that! ”
He pointed to the window. A dirty
black cloud had rushed round the cape
and emptied itself into the bay—water
streamed down the window-panes.
((/“ , AMLE Norge!” said the old man.
'- Jr “Old Norway. There is no night
there. Put that boy to bed! ”
Polly half-pushed Peter into the little
back room, where he fell, thankfully
enough, among the fishing-nets. She
covered him with a blanket and*part of
a sail. “Don’t go, Polly! There is go-
ing to be thunder and lightning. Listen
to the rain!”
“It is nothing, nothing. Oh, you make
me sick, you are so scared of things.
Listen to Gugga singing.”
“I don’t like it, Polly. I don’t like the
way he sings. I want to go home. Oh,
what does he sing about, Polly?”
“Gamle Norge, Old Norway, and about
our great-grandmother, Helen Browne,
who went over Te Reinga, where I’ll
throw you if you don’t shut up and go
to sleep.”
“You couldn’t, I am too heavy. It
is too far. You would get put in prison.
It is seven miles away. Oh, Polly, don’t
go yet.”
But Polly left him and went into the
living-room. She sat down on a box and
looked at Gugga curiously.
“I will teach you this song if you like,”
he said. “In Maori or in English or
Norwegian:
Ja vi Elsker dette Landet
Som det stiger frem
Furet Veirbidt over dandet
Med de tusind Hjem.”
“What is it about, Gugga? It is not
‘Pull for the shore, sailor,’ is it?”
“No, little fool, no. It is ‘Yes, we
love this land! ’ I’m going home to
Norway, I leave tonight.”
I—l E busied himself with the litter on'
t I the table, counting coins, examining
burnt matches and pebbles, carefully
gathering up shreds of spilt tobacco.- Pre-
sently he lit a lantern and went into his
garden, which was not much bigger than
a teatray, cut into the side of the cliff.
Polly tidied up the corner of the table,
rinsed the plates and cup and then went
and looked at Peter, who was now fast
asleep. She lit another lantern and
peered at the wax fruit, opened and shut
the Bible, pocketed two threepenny-bits
that had rolled to the floor, and then
—greatly daring—she tasted the con-
coction in Gugga’s bottle. It was not
o Continued on page 48.)
unpleasant, so she took first one big gulp
and then another. Suddenly her head
felt as if it had gone from her shoulders.
She giggled and took another mouthful
or two. After that she had great diffi-
culty in finding the cork, which was in
her hand, and then in getting it back
into the bottle.
It was quite dark outside now. She
opened the door and was glad to feel
the fresh wind on her face and to know
that her head was really safe on her
neck. A few yards away beneath the
cottage the sea was driving against the
cliff. She could hear the slip-slap-slop
of long coils of kelp as they whipped
the rodks, and she could hear the voice
of the sea, its hoarse undertones as it
searched in its caves and sobbed on its
rocks. Gugga was standing on a ledge,
and white foam burst up like a geyser and
rattled down on his streaming oilskin.
He came back at last, shaking his
head. “A wild night to set sail for Nor-
way. Still, it must be now or never.”
“You’d better wait until tomorrow,”
said Polly, “and then perhaps Dad will
help you get the boat down.”
She sat hunched up on the box feeling
very queer.
The old man did not seem to hear her. !
He went to the window and stared out- i
side into the darkness. In his old black
oilskin and sou’-wester, with his long
white beard reaching to the second but-
ton of his coat, hands buried in his
pockets, and his head shrunk down be-
tween his shoulders, he looked' like a
dejected old penguin.
Polly was suddenly very sick on the
floor. She staggered to her feet and
cleaned up the mess, her hands shaking
and her eyes full of hot tears —but she
felt decidedly better. Afterwards she
slept or dozed in a corner of the room-
where Peter was still asleep.
It must have been an hour later when
she was roused by Gugga standing over
her with a lantern in his hand. “Hush! ”
he whispered. “Don’t wake the boy. I’ve
got her down at last. Everything is
ready. Come, Helen, come, make haste
—the tide is right.”
POLLY followed him outside. “It’s
dark now, Gugga, we’ll get washed
away,” and her fingers fumbled for the
guiding rope that led to the rocks below.
She gasped as the wind tore violently
past her.
“Ker-er-ack! Ker-er-ack!” went the
little boat as it grated against the rocks.
“Be quiet, Helen,” Gugga said roughly.
“The boat is as safe as a house, I tell
you. I’ve been getting her ready for
a month. I know to a seizing what my
own boat will carry.”
“It’s so wild, Gugga, so windy and
wild. Even on fine days you never went
far out —only just so far to put down
the nets.”
“Give me the lantern, Helen. Six
lanterns. I’ll need them all. Go, girl,
go and light my lanterns.”
“Gugga!” Polly gripped his hand.
“Come back, come inside. Gugga, listen
to me. You can’t go like this, not
without your things. We’ll have to pack
your wax fruit and some kaL I wilt
ask Mum to make you a spotty-dog cake
if you will wait until tomorrow.”
“Gamle NorgeJ That’s where I’m go-
ing. I tell you there’s no night there.
Get busy, Helen, get busy.” _
“You must take tins of things, Gugga,
and your flannel shirts that we gave you
for Christmas, and your fish-hooks, and
the new jersey that Hana knitted”
“Well, perhaps you’re right, Helen.
You are a thoughtful girl. We must
take everything because we will never be
returning. I’ll get my sea-chest.”
POLLY left him trying to lug the big
box from the verandah into the living-
room. She was excited, but not fright-
ened. She took the two coins from her
pocket and put them with the little heap'
of money on the table. Then she picked?
“Go on —your move."

EISENHOWER’S BOOK.
In leading-article comment,
London “Sunday Times” said
of an accompanying review of
General Eisenhower’s much-
publicised Crusade in Europe:
In an article on this page our mili-
tary correspondent, who writes with
intimate knowledge of the events and
personalities in question, refutes with
chapter and verse some of General
Eisenhower’s allegations.
The leader further commented
that “A blow has been struck at
British-American friendship and
understanding” by the Eisen-
hower book.
The military correspondent,
after stating that Eisenhower
“has rightly earned his place in
history for his masterly hand-
ling of the immense problems
involved in bringing to battle
armies of many nations in the
liberation of a whole continent,”
and adding that much of the
book “is a long non-contro-
versial report.... .and will be of
great value to the historian,”
proceeded to deal with its “con-
troversial” element:
“One is forced to the conclu-
sion, however, that General
Eisenhower considers that, the
war was really won by America,
that every American view was
right, every British idea wrong.
He forgets to mention that
Britain was at war for two years
with pitifully inadequate de-
fences while the United States
looked on. The plain truth is
that Britain suffered losses,
offered sacrifices and sustained a
burden that was unequalled by
any other Allied nation, except
possibly Russia, and certainly
not the United States.
“Though he has many charm-
ing things to say about them,
nevertheless hardly any British
leader escapes his censure. He
suggests that Mr. Churchill’s
views on strategy, particularly in
his opposition (shared by Lord
Montgomery) to the invasion of
the South of France in August,
1944, were colored by political
rather than military considera-
tions. History will record that
the invasion of Southern France
was a strategic blunder of, the
first magnitude, and that it was
an American blunder. It cer-
tainly lost Vienna to the Western
Allies.
“His comments on Field-
Marshal Lord Montgomery,
th'at he lived in a trailer sur-
rounded by a few aides and that
he consistently refused to deal
with a staff officer fronj any
headquarters other than his own,
are utterly untrue and give a
false picture of a highly scien-
tific system of command in the
field.
“The impression is created
that the idea of an eventual
cross - Channel invasion was
American and that everyone
else opposed it. This is Ameri-
can propaganda. The British
view always was that it was not
feasible in 1942 or 1943. The
Americans were completely out
of touch with the practical reali-
ties of the war, and finally had
to admit that the British view
was right.
“Eisenhower’s consistent re-
fusal to have an overall Army
Commander - in - Chief will
always be a matter for discus-
sion and criticism. He insisted
on commanding the land armies
himself; he is not in any way
a battle commander, and he had
had no previous experience ; in
fact, he did not understand how
to command in the field.
“In the higher sphere of
Supreme Command, his qualities
as a ‘lubricator’ of the gigantic
machine which had been created
for the invasion were without
equal. But a Supreme Com-
mander sits on a lofty perch ; he
exercises command in a great
strategical sphere and he can-
not exercise tactical command at
the same time. Eisenhower did
attempt to do so, with results
disastrous in their post-war set-
ting.
“In the campaign in North-
west Europe he descended into
N. Y. “Herald Tribune.”
SAID THE SPIDER TO THE FLY.
the tactical realm at a moment
when the strategy and political
objects were of vital import-
ance ; the enemy had been
severely defeated’ in battle and
everything else could have been
added unto us, given a firm cap-
tain of the ship.”
Declaring that Ralph Inger-
soll was right in Top Secret
when he wrote that in August,
1944, a Supreme Allied Com-
mander with the right qualifica-
tions could have ended the war
by Christmas, the “Sunday
Times” military correspondent
further commented:
“General Eisenhower alleges
that Montgomery suddenly pro-
posed in August, 1944, that he
should retain tactical co-ordinat-
ing control of all ground forces
throughout the campaign, in ad-
dition to retaining command of
21 Army Group. This is abso-
lutely untrue. Montgomery
urged most strongly that Eisen-
hower should appoint a land-
force commander to control the
land battle and keep it on the
rails ; he never suggested that he
could do this and at the same
time retain direct command of
21 Army Group. He urged that,
if he himself was not acceptable
as land-force commander, then
Bradley should be given the job,
and he offered to serve under
Bradley; he did so in writing
several times. This sensible sug-
gestion is described by Eisen-
hower as ‘fantastic.’
“Eisenhower’s judgment was
in this instance clouded by the
possibilities of adverse public
opinion. He felt that Britain
would never accept General
Bradley as Supreme Land Com-
mander, though Montgomery
told him that we would agree
to anything which would shorten
the war.
“Montgomery has always be-
lieved that the war could have
been won by the end of 1944,
and that heavy casualties, par-
ticularly the 70,000 Americans
in the Ardennes, could have
been saved by concentrating the
whole Allied advance, backed
by our total administrative
strength, on the left through
Brussels and across the Rhine
into the North German plains.
Eisenhower preferred a broad-
front strategy and describes
Montgomery’s plan as a pencil-
like thrust which would meet
certain destruction. This is
grossly misleading. The right
flank was to be on the Ardennes
and the left flank on the North
Sea ; over a million men would
have been involved in the move-
ment.
“It was clear to Montgomery
in Normandy that the German
High Command was postponing
withdrawal dangerously late. His
plan was designed to exploit this
situation and to deal the Ger-
man forces a blow which would
make their quick recovery im-
possible. We did not do this,
and thus lost a great opportunity
of exploiting fully the German
disorganisation consequent on
their crushing defeat in the
Falaise-Argentan battle.
“Had Montgomery’s plan
been adopted it would have
shortened the war. It also held
great possibilities of bringing
about the end of the war in
Europe with a political balance
much more favorable to an
early and stable peace than the
actual outcome. With a proper
plan we could have been in Ber-
lin, Prague and Vienna before
the Russians.”
After supporting Mont-
gomery’s strategy against Eisen-
hower’s with detailed examples
and describing Montgomery’s
plan for the Normandy landing
and break-through, the “Sunday
Times” military correspondent
scathingly comments: “General
Eisenhower says he had his own
long-term plan carefully out-
lined at staff meetings before
D-Day. This is the first public
mention of it. It is clear that
the plan was never shaped be-
yond the first three months. No
one who was on the staff at that
time knew anything about this
‘phantom plan.’ It is apparently
being wise after the event.”
footnote to the article
comments; “Eisenhower’s book
shows clearly that Mr.
Churchill’s aim was to be in
Berlin first, whereas the
Supreme Commander [Eisen-
hower] did not seem to look be-
yond the destruction of the Ger-
man field armies.”
Mere “Philosophers.”
Mr. Chifley’s “philosophers”
as seen by a French publication,
Nice “Matin”:
“These are not riots, strikes
or rebellions that are happening
in' France; it is war, horrible,
deadly war, which has been de-
clared upon us by a foreign im-
perialism, and which is waged,
cynically, upon our soil by the
most powerful fifth-column the
world has ever known.
“Away with lies and hypo-
crisy! It has required only a
few days to destroy a third of
our national mineral wealth, a
success that was registered
neither by the invasion of 1914,
nor the defeat of 1940.
“Without striking a blow it-
self the Red Army is ruining
our national economy, and no
offensive in the grand style nor
any atomic bombs could have
produced such a catastrophe.”
Russians Weigh War.
Describing his sources of in-
formation in Moscow as “men
who know the Soviet Union and
Communist dogma,” a Berlin
correspondent of N.Y. “Times”
reports a division of opinion in
the Politburo “on the vital ques-
tion of war or peace with the
West”; the final decision on
which “will be one of the most
important in history.”
On one side, the report runs,
is a group that for the past year
has advocated war. Its view—
that a Soviet-U.S. war is in-
evitable, anyway, and that
Russia’s best chance of success
lies in fighting in the immediate
future, or at least before 1950 —
is based on the knowledge that
Western Europe is growing
stronger daily and the conclusion
that the Communist-expected
U.S. depression, counted on to
cripple the U.S. and cut aid to
Europe, is not going to develop
within the next five years.
Two other assumptions figure
in the war-group’s reckoning:
(1) Though U.S. and Britain are
far superior on the industrial
side, once the Soviet Army had
overrun Western Europe the
Russians would possess the in-
dustrial resources of the Ruhr,
the Low Countries and France,
and “all Russians believe the
‘workers’ [in those countries]
would rally to the support of
the Soviet Army” ; (2) that the
U.S. would not care to use the
atomic bomb on any of the over-
run countries.
The probability of eventual
war between East and West is
accepted by the other Politburo
group, but the steadying view is
that Russia is not yet strong
enough and won’t be till it has
not only atomic bombs but an
industrial structure that can sus-
tain the shock of Western atomic
bombing and still keep the
Soviet Union going. If war
comes now, those holding this
view believe the Soviet Union,
with its slowly recovering indus-
try, its highly centralised govern-
ment, its vulnerable communica-
tions could not survive the shock
of the first large-scale strategic
bombings.
They nourish the hope that in
time Russia’s own industry plus
that of the Soviet satellites will
match that of the U.S. and the
rest. And, of course, as well as
clinging to the wishful expecta-
tion of a U.S. depression, they
count on their Communist fifth-
column to carry on its dedicated
job of fomenting unrest and
preventing recovery in Western
European and other countries.
Germans Interviewed.
A group of German editors
on an invitation visit to the U.S.
sat down at a round-table inter-
view for “U.S. News and World
Report.” In the following ques-
tion-and-answer extract differ-
ent members of the group give
the answers:
Q. What do you visualise
will be the behavior of the
21,000,000 Germans living under
another flag while their brethren
are living under a free Ger-
many ? Is it conceivable that
whoever dominates that zone —
Russia, or whoever it is—will
have an Alsace-Lorraine in an-
other form, with a constant feel-
ing or desire to get back that
territory ?
A. Oh, yes—there would be
nationalistic feeling.
Q. Would the people in
Western Germany try to get their
brethren back ?
A. v Yes.
Q. Doesn’t that argue, per-
haps, therefore, that the Russians
may some day feel that they
ought not to continue to retain
Eastern Germany ? Don’t they
even now profess that they have
no purpose permanently to keep
Eastern Germany ?
A. In Germany, especially
with the Berlin situation, there
are very few people who do not
see through this Russian argu-
ment of saying they want to get
out of Eastern Germany and
unite Germany. My opinion is
that the large masses in Ger-
many realise that what the
Soviet Union wants is control of
Western Germany, either
through Communist-party con-
trol or through direct domina-
tion.
Q, Are most of the German
people convinced in their own
minds of the Russian ambition
to Communise all of Germany ?
A. All of Europe.
Q. What about the German

people themselves ? Do youi
think they feel that way ?
A. Russia hasn’t many sym-
pathisers.
Q. Do you think the Berlin
issue has dramatised this whole
question of Russian control ?
Are the people of Germany com-
pletely aware of all the implica-
tions of the blockade?
A. The German people
realise by this blockade the
Russians want to take this whole
area and the German people
feel that, between the two, the
Americans are the lesser evil.
Answering a further question,
on the current war talk, one of
the German editors said; “A
very large number of [German]
people say, ‘We don’t want to
fight with the Americans and
we don’t want to fight with the
Russians. We want to keep out
of it.’ ”
To another question, one of
them gave the answer, “The
Russians are bluffing.” To the
question, “Is Christianity on the
march in Germany or is it fail-
ing to make progress?” the Ger-
man editor’s answer was:
“Christianity is making progress
in Germany. There is no doubt
about it. I think the Catholic
Church in Bavaria, for example,
is a better bulwark against Com-
munism than the Americans
could be.”
Air-lift Racket.
There’s evidently nothing that
somebody or other won’t try to
cash-in on, and that goes for
the Berlin air-lift, N. Y. “Herald-
Tribune” reporting a black-
market in Berlin established and
supplied by a group operating by
air-service.
Described as mostly “Polish”
displaced persons, they’ve been
coolly defying the Russian block-
ade and everything else and fly-
ing “goods into Berlin by the
ton and money by the ton out
again.”
The “money by the ton” isn’t
mere exaggeration: when the
authorities clamped down they
found close on a ton of silver,
as well as large amounts of other
currency, in one lot ready for
flying out to Frankfurt.
The stuff was being fiown-in
to a purely fictitious charitable
organisation. A genuine charit-
able organisation, no doubt on
the principle that here was a real
case of charity beginning at
home, gave the phony show
away to the authorities.
Church and the Bomb.
Two points of view expressed
in the Church Assembly in
London, when a report of the
'(Church) Commission on Atomic
Power was being discussed:
The Bishop of Chichester said
the report stated/that, on the
assumption that khe possession
of atomic weapojns was neces-
sary for national self-preserva-
tion, a Government responsible
for the safety of( its community
was entitled t<p manufacture
them and hold tliem in readiness
and to use them} against an un-
scrupulous aggreksof in cases of
“defensive necessity.” “Here,”
said the Bishop, (“is a proclama-
tion that necessity knows no
law.”
The Dean of I Chichester (a
member of the coibimission) said
the vital question] was whether
the pacifist view tlhat there was
nothing worse th\an war was
Christian. The ponnt of the re-
port was that war Was engaged
in because some injustice had
been committed or' some un-
righteous state of things created.
Righteousness, he abided, was
more important than pleace.
Radioactive Cows.
Observation of a hercf. of 58
baldy-faced Herefords shlowing
effects from the atom-bomvb ex-
plosion in New Mexico in \luly,
1945, helps to emphasise soVne-
thing more of the nature of Ahe
horror hanging over the worM,
The cattle, states a report An
N. Y. “Herald-Tribune,” wer&
overlooked when the area
cleared before the 1945 explo-
sion. The cattle were miles
away, where hills protected them
rom the flash of heat, from the
blast effects and from the radio-
active rays. But desert dust,
stirred up by the bomb, rose
with the atomic column and
floated with the atomic cloud,
and this dust was radioactive.
The cloud drifted over the herd,
and a light rain fell, peppering
them with dust and probably
with other radioactive particles.
The cattle, discovered by a
plane, were placed under obser-
vation. After a few days the
Washington “Post:"
“I KEEP THINKING I SEE FOOTPRINTS.”
hair on their backs turned white
in long bands of varying widths.
Afterwards most of this hair fell
out. Later the hair grew again
on some, but not on all. When
new hair came it was no.t the
original red color, but mostly
grey. On some there were per-
manent bald streaks, and others
developed sores on their backs.
After healing, some developed
thick deep scars. The cattle
seem more susceptible to skin
troubles than normal cattle.
The radioactive rays that
cause these injuries can also
cause cancer. No malignancies
have appeared, but the cattle
will be watched, because cancers
resulting from radioactivity may
take years to develop.
There was one bull in the
herd, and he has sired calves
from the cows. No hereditary
effects have appeared in the
calves, but the heredity possibili-
ties will be watched for a long
tirpe, for radioactive damage is
often long delayed.
The report concludes with this
cold comfort: “The warning for
human beings is to beware of
dust and rain in the vicinity of
an atomic-bomb explosion.”
Losing the Peace.
Looking into “when, how and
why we lost the peace,” William
Henry Chamberlin, in “Wall-
street Journal,” quotes as highly
important twb articles in “Life”
by William C. Bullitt, in which
this former U.S. Ambassador
tells how Roosevelt, under the
influence of Harry Hopkins, who
had become his chief war-time
adviser, set out to convert Stalin,
by appeasement, from Soviet im-
perialism to democratic col-
laboration.
Bullitt drew up a memoran-
dum objecting to this programme
as futile and dangerous. Roose-
velt’s reaction to Bullitt’s
memorandum, called by Cham-
berlin “a historical revelation of
the first importance,” was:
“Bill, I don’t dispute your
facts ; they are accurate. I don’t
dispute the logic of your rea-
soning. I just have a hunch that
Stalin is not that kind of a man.
Harry [Hopkins] says he’s not
and that he 'doesn’t want any-
thing but security for his
\ country, and I think that if I
\give him everything I possibly
San and ask nothing from him
in return, noblesse oblige, he
won’t try to annex anything and
will work with me for a world
of democracy and peace.”
“So,” comments Chamberlin,
“on the confessed basis of a
‘hunch,’ inspired by a man who
knew even less about Soviet
Russia than he did, President
Roosevelt embarked on one of
the most disastrous diplomatic
ventures in American history
.... With a blindness that must
have caused the Soviet dictator
much secret glee, the American
representatives at Yalta and else-
where acquiesced in measures
calculated to discourage our
friends and help our Communist
enemies. Poland was sold out
with a cynicism rare even in in-
ternational politics, and Stalin
was bribed to enter the war
against Japan with sweeping
concessions at the expense of
China.”
Crust-earners.
“U.S. News and World Re-
port” states that earning a com-
fortable living “is a lot easier
in the U.S. than it is in Britain
under Socialism or in Russia
under Communism.”
With an impressive array of
data in support, it adds that a
worker under capitalism in the
U.S. earns far more with less
work than a worker in either of
the other mentioned lands:
“The U.S. worker, in buying
power, makes more than twice
as much as an average Briton;
10 times as much as a Russian.
Output is higher in America, too.
Living standard under capitalism
far outstrips the best record of
the other systems. Neither
Socialism nor Communism, in
practice, is able, to date, to give
workers the good things that they
enjoy under American capi-
talism.”
In Praise of U.N.O.
“Christian Science Monitor”
chief Washington correspondent
Roscoe Drummond, upholding
the view that U.N.O. isn’t fairly
to be judged by what it ought to
be and isn’t but by such merit
as can be seen in it:
“One of its cardinal and most
self-justifying services today is
that it is the assured and visible
means of keeping the Western
nations and the Soviet Union in
almost continuous diplomatic
contact.
“When the Big Four Foreign
Ministers reach an unbearably
strained impasse they can * and
do turn to the United Nations.
More than once they have done
so, and the mechanism of the
U.N. makes peace more possible
and war more difficult.
“More than anything else, the
U.N. brings Soviet diplomacy,
Soviet purposes, into the open.
There the Russians have to ap-
pear before the world, and, re-
gardless of what they say, they
have to stand up and be counted.
Though only a small part of
Soviet policy rises to sight, even
this much visibility is all to the
good.
“As yet, the U.N. is without
physical force, but it is not with-
out moral force. Its moral
force protected the integrity of
Iran. Its moral force has helped
to shield Greece from still
worse aggression on its borders.
It has other accomplishments to
its credit.
“In wanting to see the U.N.
improved, we ought not to over-
look how good the U.N.
already is.”

Assop for U.N.O. Old ?Esop
could have had the recent U.N.O.
mediator flop in mind: The Whales
and the Dolphins, he narrates, were
fighting and wouldn’t stop. So the

this? It would be so much better
to be at peace.” They looked at him
and replied, “We’d rather go on fight-
ing for ever than be reconciled by a
Sprat like you.”

Non-burning Plane Fluid. —A new
Standard Oil product described as
“the first completely non-inflammable
aircraft hydraulic fluid” is reported
in N. Y. “Herald Tribune” as, ready
to go on the market (> right away. It
is claimed for the product that “it
eliminates a fire hazard that is a
factor with the large planes which
use high-pressure hydraulic systems”
for various purposes. Representing
“more than two years of intensified
experimenting,” the new fluid is
claimed to be “so resistant to fire that
it is under consideration for use in
fire extinguishers and in fire-control
systems on planes.”

Anti-war Truman. Stating that
“History will not call Truman a war-
monger,” a writer in N. Y. “Daily
Mirror” adds a note for Clio to chalk
up to the President’s credit: that in
communicating to Secretary of State
Marshall his idea of sending Chief
Justice Vinson to see Stalin, Truman
wrote, “I pray I may never again
be confronted with the decision I had
to make regarding Hiroshima.”

British Industry's Part. —Federation
of British Industries president Sir
Frederick Bain, speaking in London:
“Never in the history of British in-
dustry has so much money been spent
on research not limited to profit-
making. There had never been in
British industry such a spirit of ad-
venture in research as there is at this
moment.” He added that American
experts who had come to Britain
believing it was as good as done for
were going back convinced of the
“terrific and surprising triumph that
has been accomplished by British
industry in spite of six years of war
destruction.” Britain would win
through “because of a sense of self-
sacrifice and effort that no other part
of the world has shown.”
* * * *
Concerning Mr. Lie. —Like other
American commentators on the
Lie-Evatt letter calling on the in-
terested parties to get together again
and settle the Berlin deadlock, N. Y.
“Daily News” was prepared to give
Dr. Evatt the benefit of a doubt,
but it had no doubts about Mr.
“The former Norwegian Minister oi
Justice, to put it bluntly, has long
been suspected of overfriendliness
toward Communist Russia. He was
the Russian favorite, to begin with,
when it came to appointing a per-
manent Secretary-General for the
U.N., and Soviet influence was largely
responsible for getting Lie the job.
In this position he has never notice-
ably worked against Russia; has, in-
deed, helped Russia on various
occasions in quiet, unobtrusive but
effective ways. It is not surprising,
in view of Lie’s record, to see him
hand the Soviet this propaganda
plum.”

Effect of the Polls. —View advanced
in the London “Times” correspon-
dence discussion of the U.S. public-
opinion polls’ sad showing: “The
logical deduction is not that public-
opinion analysis is inaccurate, but that
its own forecasts can, by themselves,
influence the public and cause elec-
tors to vote irresponsibly in the belief .
that the result is a foregone con-
clusion. This may possibly have
happened,' to a lesser extent, in the
last general election in Britain.
The important question now arises
whether we should tolerate this
irrational factor in our public affairs
any longer.”

U.S. Labor Control. —Though it is
generally conceded that organised
labor strongly supported Truman and
his Democrats in resentment towards
the Taft-Hartley Act imposing con-
trols on unions and strikes, a staff
writer of N. Y. “Daily News” fore-
casts that there will not be outright
repeal of that Act and return to the
old Wagner Act. “After all,” he
points out, “there are still in the new
Congress 225 members (Democrats
and Republicans) who voted for the
original Taft-Hartley bill.” A com-
promise between the two measures is
considered probable, but: “One thing
is certain —union leaders and cor-
poration executives will have to take
the anti-Communist pledge.”
* * * *
Nationalised and Not. —A “Wall-
street Journal” writer looks into
Britain’s coal and steel: “Total out-
put and individual productivity have
declined in the mines, compared with
pre-war figures. The- Coal Board,
which manages the nationalised mines,
has found it necessary to raise the
price of coal to the consumer twice.
The privately-owned steel industry, on
the other hand, has broken all records
for output and sales.”
* * * *
Doctors Rushed—As already noted
here, the eye-doctors are being rushed
under Britain’s give-away Health Ser-
vice, but “Wall-street Journal’s” Lon-
don correspondent reports that general
practitioners are even worse beset.
“Many report their work has doubled
or even trebled since the start of
Health Service. About 93 per cent,
of Britain’s 45 million people are
listed on the Health Service roster.
Patients are flocking to their doctors
for treatment of a wide number of
minor complaints such as insect bites,
simple colds, minor injuries and in-
fections which they used to cope with
at home. Some doctors are treating
as many as 60 to 70 patients at a
sitting, which they feel leads to
assembly-line medicine. The Health
Service doesn’t help this plight any
when it permits a ceiling of 4000
patients on each doctor’s list. Many
feel 2000 should be the maximum m
order to assure adequate treatment.”

"THESE BE OUR FRIENDS."
Mr. Chifley, it would appear, has been
responsible for the feeblest sessional state-
ment on foreign affairs to which Parlia-
ment has listened for many a year. But
almost eveik' sentence of it smelted
strongly of Dr. Evatt, and it seemed as
though the author, whoever he might be,
was preoccupied with other things.
It, for instance, took the history of the
Berlin conferences and disputes only to
the point at which Mr. Trygve Lie and
Australia’s perennially-wandering boy
decided to interfere, and said nothing of
their rebuffs, their failures and their
apparent retirement from the field.
There are other striking gaps and
omissions in the statement, which devoted
three pages to the petty affairs of Greece
and the Balkans and four pages to the
Palestine question. A distinct vagueness
becomes apparent on all points except
upon the theme that Dr. Evatt and his
myrmidons have done an unexampled
job and ride astride a bucking world
with an easy seat and a confident rein.
Mr. Chifley infuses a little humor into
his curious document by stating that Dr.
Evatt’s appointment as president of the
United Nations “greatly increases the
responsibilities and influence of Aus-
tralia.” And he remarks inaccu-
rately, in the light of the part played by
Mr, W. M. Hughes at Versailles and Mr.
S. M. Bruce’s high prestige as president
of the League of Nations Council when
that body seemed to be getting some-
where, that the Doctor’s new office is
“the highest position in international
affairs ever occupied by an Australian.”
It is, in fact, almost as high as Haman’s.
The occupant of it must inevitably serve
two masters —the Soviet Union and its
jackal group of “ex-colonial” nations,
rescued from the “tyranny” of the “im-
perialists” of Britain and America, and
his own country —in Dr. Evatt’s case,
also, the British Commonwealth, which
seems to come a bad last in any matters
with which the Australian delegates deal.
Earth-shaking information is conveyed
in paragraph after paragraph of tffp
Chifley statement:
The Australian delegation opened the
economic debates drawing attention to the
great influence which the progressive solu-
tion of economic problems will have on the
solution of political problems.
Nobody in a shattered world had appa-
rently ever heard this great truth till it
was unearthed and made manifest by our
erudite representative; also, the world
was in complete ignorance of its own im-
perfections until the thunder rolled and
The Australian delegation pointed out
again, as Dr. Evatt did at the Economic
and Social Council in August, that the
organisation of machinery for promoting
and maintaining full employment by inter-
national action is far from adequate.
Too right it is—especially in Indonesia,
the U.S.S.R., China, Burma, the Philip-
pines and other nations whose ideals
appear to be so close to those of Dr.
Evatt that they are almost always found
voting with him or he with them.
One notable instance of Evatt evasion
of real issues and practical co-operation
is the North Atlantic Pact, to which Mr.
Chifley devotes only a fraction of the
space that he gives to the affairs of
Greece and Palestine, This arrangement
already embraces the western nations of
Europe—U.K., France, Netherlands, Bel-
gium, Luxemburg—in a “treaty of cul-
tural, collaborative and collective self-
defence.” An extension is envisaged
under which Canada and the United
States may join. President Truman has
said:
This development deserves our full sup-
port. I am confident that the United States
will, by appropriate means, extend to the
free nations the support which the situa-
tion requires.
The Canadian Prime Minister has given
the scheme his approval as “a partial
realisation of the idea of collective
security, by an arrangement made in
accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations,” and has expressed his country’s
readiness “to negotiate with the Western
Union nations for an effective system of
collective security.” But, white digging
its nose into the affairs of Indonesia’s
rebel area, into Palestine and Greece,
“the Australian Government has taken
no part in the discussions of the proposed
Pact;” And Mr. Chifley has not even an
encouraging or approving word for it,
apparently because taking notice of it
might involve his Government in com-
mitments which would call for more than
boastings and resolutions.
The same applies to China ; and there is
a curious variation between two state-
ments made by Mr. Chifley during a
single sitting of Parliament. In reply to
a question on December 2, the day on
which he delivered his foreign-affairs
statement, Mr. Chifley said that there
could be “no question of the seriousness
of the situation in China” and that he
“thought the influence of the Chinese
Communists constituted a grave danger
to peace in Eastern Asia.”
But the foreign-affairs statement merely
said that the position was “most con-
fused,” that members “should not take for
granted all reports which they might hear
regarding the progress of the fighting be-
tween the Chinese Government and the
Communists,” though it was “clear that
the Chinese Government had received
some setbacks” —they were at the time in
a state of complete chaos, as it happened,
as Mr. Chifley’s representatives in Japan
had known for more than a month.
Contrary to the usual “policy”
of poking their noses into every little
quarrel out of which a drop of kudos
could be dredged, Mr. Chifley and his
colleagues have issued no clarion-call to
the United Nations to pull off the aggres-
sors against the Chinese or to appoint a
commission to examine the issues and
make peace in China,
The only deducible reason is that any
interference with a Communist victory
would be unpalatable to almost all the
Australian Government’s diplomatic
associates in the “comity” of Asiatic bar-
barisms.
It is ready enough always to interfere,
but it is a striking fact, as in Malaya,
China and Indo-China, that interference
never develops where it would be against
the interests of the Soviet Union and its
satellites and those who run with them.
Our wharfies would never sanction inter-
ference in those cases.
Australia has had a grandstand view of
Canberra policy in action during the
last few days at Lapstone Hotel.
' There our delegates were seen parading
with their associates in all their glory
when they voted for the admission of the
“Indonesian Republic,” a fevered, un-
stable product of Japanese collaboration
and Communist intrigue, into E.C.A.F.E.
as an associate member, well knowing
that it would result in a breach with the
friendly and loyal Dutch and tension
with the United States, the only country
in the Pacific which today could stand
between us and engulfment by a major
enemy, and the country whose effort
largely prevented this land from becoming
overrun by Japanese in World War 11.
Australians should take a good look at
those with whom their delegates voted
under definite instruction from the
Cabinet, as th»Prime Minister has made
clear.
First comes Burma, seething with
bloodshed and rebellion, described in
September by the “S, M. Herald” corres-
pondent as “a Marxist State sliding to-
wards bankruptcy” ; next, the Philippines,
an ungrateful protege living on the rich
bounty of the United States, which it
frequently opposes, and so disorganised
that it cannot keep murder and banditry
off its roads in the environs of its capital,
even in the presence of a substantial
American military force. Then there was
China, whose Government has no
authority to speak for anybody at the
moment, and whose Administration —left
to fight alone and hold back the tide of
Communism from south-east Asia —has
dissolved into chaos, its capital and large
cities given over to corruption, black-
marketing and riot. Finally there is Soviet
Russia, whose delegate has insulted every
civilised Power during the course of the
conference, and used the conference-room
as a platform from which to broadcast
incitement to insurrection within the
British Commonwealth, of which we are
supposed to be an integral part. And
there are Pakistan and India, whose joint
judicial representative in Tokyo has re-
cently assailed the White Australia policy,
and repudiated the doctrine that Japan
was guilty of aggression in beginning the
war against the Western nations.
They are two brand-new States which
themselves are conducting a clandestine
mutual war against each other in
Kashmir.
These were the nations with which Aus-
tralia and Socialist New Zealand were
found yoting against the interest of a loyal
ally of the war and a member of the
Atlantic Union of Defence. These were,
and are normally, the boon companions
of our diplomacy in preference to the
stable Western Powers of our own blood
and type of civilisation.
Let Australians look at them and
consider what they have been dragged
into by Dr. Evatt’s ambitions and
Mr, Chifley’s indifference and ignor-
ance. And let them reflect seriously
on whether or no the Chifley Govern-
ment’s helping to build an “Indonesian”
Government in Java out of the product of
a rebellion initiated by Japanese war-
time effort and fostered by Moscow back-
ing is not creating a stepping-stone for
the invasion of Australia or a foothold
from which our Asiatic friends, spurred
on by the U.S.S.R., may presently seek to
dominate our policies, including that
which embodies the concept of White
Australia,
They're Racing!
In the recorded history of the Southern
Hemisphere only one people, our own,
has withstood foreign conquest after in-
vasion of part of its territories; and it
would be crazy to suppose that the danger
is over for all time. To the actual threat
from Japan, which is all too likely to
rise from its ruins, there has succeeded
the grim certainty of challenges from a
Communised Asia, Indonesia included,
to our reservation of this continent
for the white race, with an English-
speaking democracy in control. The first
of these challenges, aimed by “Aus-
tralian” Communists co-operating with
Communist savages in South-East Asia
and under orders from Moscow, may be
said to have taken shape already.
So it behoves us Australians to study,
reflect on and provide against disasters
worse than those which, from Sumatra
to South America, at the hands of small
bands of adventurers —Spanish, Dutch,
even Portuguese—overtook a medley of
easygoing peoples ; peoples which had no
powerful protectors, one supreme in the
Pacific, such as we had.
In the cases of the Peruvians and the
Malays, a working knowledge of the
essential facts could be acquired even by
punters in moments stolen from con-
sideration of “the weights,” “the accept-
ances,” the Tuesday and Thursday gallops,
the Friday “reviews,” the marking of
“place cards,” the racecourse and s.p.
wagering, the stride-by-stride radio de-
scriptions of the races and the post-
mortems in the Sunday and Monday
papers. '
Climate was a factor in the downfall
of all those dark-skinned peoples ; and
climate -is having palpable effects in Aus-
tralia, though, in the march of science,
we have counteracting resources such as
Malays, Peruvians, Polynesians and
Melanesians never possessed. But the
s.wift conquest of the Peruvians was attri-
buted by Prescott to the debilitating
effects of “social security,” on which
Australian “Labor” has set its heart.
Gunpowder was no mystery to those
Peruvians, and with gunpowder at their
service they might have knocked the
Spaniards for a row of pins. But they
were corrupted and reduced to insignifi-
cance by a foretaste of the Australian
“Labor” policy and objective.
The Malays, “in the islands from the
Philippines to Java, and from Sumatra to
Timor,” shared the fate of the Peruvians
whom the rugged individualist Pizarro
overcame, but not from the same causes.
Those Malays combined socialism with
the Australian “Labor” prescription of
Booze and Betting: in their case,
arrack, cockfighting and lotteries, world
without end. They had (and have) char-
acteristics which moved an Encydopcedia
Britannica man to write of them in this
strain:
They are indolent, pleasure-loving, fond
of comfort and ease. They dislike toil
exceedingly. They borrow rather than earn
money. They frequently refuse to work
for a wage, though in sore need of cash.
They are addicted to gambling. They show
a marvellous loyalty to their rajahs and
chiefs.
With “union secretaries” and “presi-
dents” substituted for “rajahs” and
“chiefs,” it might almost have been
written of a very large section of
Australians on the waterfront and
elsewhere. These fellows show “a
marvellous loyalty” to their Communist
rajahs and chiefs, “dislike toil exceed-
ingly” and are “addicted to gambling.”
So “addicted to gambling” that book-
makers batten on them —bookmakers
with safe-deposit boxes and the like.
Jockeys are in another category. By all
the rules of “the game,” as laid down by
racing reporters who brag over the air
and get their slush into printed columns,
jockeys ought to be on velvet when they
retire; but this is far from being the
case, though the harsh facts are concealed
from mug punters. In Sydney there can
be seen a jockey who, the most famous
of his generation, known to have received
£6OOO for riding a winner and to have
lost £7OOO by the end of the week, was
reduced to having a collection taken up
for him. Such of the bookmakers who
contributed laid the poor devil the odds
to “a fiver.” They didn’t have to dip into
their safe-deposit boxes to pay out. Nor
will these parasites and their fellows have
any qualms as to their calling white
“Labor,” in its devotion to “socialisation”
and the pursuit of private wealth by
gambling, remains in power.
Just Pushed Around.
What has happened to the Australian in
his own country? A generation ago he
was famous for his independence. In
the South African war he was the only
soldier who could match the Boer at his
own game of stalking and shooting, and
the British War Office asked for more
and more Australian bushmen. In the
war of 1914-18 he burst on to the beaches
of Gallipoli and drove the Turks back
up over the crests of the hills., Then he
dug in and held on for eight gruelling
months, short of water, racked with
dysentery and at the last chilled by the
winter blizzards which swept in over the
Probably the typical Australian was
the outback man, who was the light-
horseman. Remember what Allenby said
about the Light Horse, when the fighting
was over and Serafend was forgotten?:
I have found them eager in advance and
staunch in defence. At Beersheba, a
mounted charge by a light-horse regiment,
armed only with rifles, swept across the
Turkish trenches and decided the day. The
Australian lighthorseman combines with a
splendid physique a restless activity of mind.
.... It confers on him the gift of adapta-
bility and this is the secret of much of his
success, mounted or on f00t... .The Aus-
tralian lighthorseman has proved himself
equal to the best. He has earned the grati-
tude of the Empire and the admiration of
the world.
In the recent war Field-Marshals Alex-
ander and Montgomery have both testi-
fied about the men of the Ninth Division
at Alamein, which was a true cross-
section of the Australian. So nothing
was wrong with him as a soldier in three
wars. In the last two he had a favorite
song, the refrain of which went something
like this (in other words):
We won’t be messed about!
We’re jiggered if we’ll be messed about.
But although the Australian soldier
sang that song in this war and his father
before him in the 1914-18 one, he cer-
tainly does allow himself to be messed
about in his own country. Officialdom
and Bumbledom lead him by the ears
and tweak his nose. The Comrades of
the hammer and sickle whiteant his
unions and upset his life, the Federal
Government taxes him to the bone and
leaves him nothing for his own ambitious
future, and he is enmeshed in a spider s-
web of controls. He walks home because
there is a train and tram strike, -to find
his wife in tears because there is no gas.
The Commos in the coalmines keep him
on tenterhooks over coal supplies. Every
day he is harassed by rising costs, nearly
a hundred,per cent, more than they were
eight or nine years ago.
Thousands of Australians voted Labor
because they thought a Labor Govern-
ment would deal better with the many
problems following the war than any
other. They wanted security and to be
citizens in a contented and prosperous
country. But what has been the result
since Mr. Chifley became Prime Minister?
Australians have seen a Government
afraid to govern in important things and
tyrannous in petty ones. They have
seen hordes of Federal Government ser-
vants created, 100,000 more than in 1939,
each blown up with self-importance,
and many of them are rude, overbearing
and inefficient. They have seen the pre-
sent Government’s foreign policy dictated
by the wharflaborers, who decided what
should come in or go out of the country,
and then that foreign policy handled by
a publicity-drunk Minister who does not
deign to inform the people, the Parlia-
ment or even his own Prime Minister
what he is about. They have seen the
present Prime Minister attempt to take
away their control over their own money
so that he could force them to bank with
one bank only—his bank, with his
nominee as governor. They have seen
the Opposition in the Federal Parliament,
who represent half the people in the
Commonwealth, stifled, insulted and re-
fused the right of free speech.
And in the last few weeks they have
seen the worst thing of all —a sovereign
State blockaded by Communist-dominated
unions, and no action taken by the
Federal Government, except to divert
coal-ships from that State’s ports. Mind
you, the Government was busy. In addi-
tion to the distractions of the Jock Garden
forgery case, the Falstein case and the
intriguing business of the late Senator
Keane’s trunks, it had the affair of the
Manila girls on its hands, a handful ot
women who were earning their living
outside Australia. Although these had
proper passports, they Government be-
grudged them the freedom they could
obtain in other countries, and put its
energies into forcing them to return.
Yet the Australian stands it all and
doesn’t rebel. He lets himself be pushed
around. What has happened to him, to
his independence, to his hatred of
tyranny? , ~
Is he waiting for his opportunity at the
next elections? The referendum and the
by-elections are signs pointing that way.
Perhaps he is waiting for his chance.

PLAIN ENGLISH
The "Labor " Sophists.
The year is drawing to its close with a
spirit of restlessness again abroad all
over the globe. Uncertainty is the key-
note of this post-war world, many coun-
tries (some British) being already the
floundering victims of Socialism and
threatened further by the Communist
fifth-column ; the United States is uneasy
in a world in which democratic forms of
government have crumbled one after an-
other. The position in Asia has drifted
alarmingly following the present apparent
stalemate on the European Communist
front.
In Australia the Federal “Labor”
Government is in constant retreat before
the Communist industrial offensive. The
Socialists pressed for the crazy 40-hour
week, which the Corns knew would
further reduce Australian productive
capacity and which they therefore de-
manded insistently; the Chifleyites also
seem determined to gear the country down
to the standards called for by the most
importunate and irresponsible Socialist
supporter, and hang the effect on national
progress.
Mr. Chifley months ago said he re-
garded Communism as a “political philo-
sophy,” and he still —despite his visit to
Berlin and subsequent utterances —is of
the opinion that Communism can best be
defeated by an improvement in'the “social
condition.” He does not yet seem to
realise that the Communist menace in
Australia arises in no way from popular
feeling, but is simply a brazen revolu-
tionary operation being carried out in
Australia under the guidance of a foreign
Power. And its success in frustrating
Australian industrial development and im-
provement in the “social condition” has
been possible only because of the Chifley
Socialists’ cold, feet and class-bitterness
complex.
There is a fine future ahead of this
country if we can only pull out of the
tail-heavy spin into which Socialism has
projected us, and decide to work and
think as a nation again. We are today
drinking the dregs left by a scheme of
mass vote-buying and class-friction imple-
mented by a “Labor” Government pos-
sessing the lowest political standards ever
seen in the Federal sphere. We must
return to a spirit of national service, with
a determination that real national service
shall receive its due recognition ; but, be-
fore anything other than the purchase of
votes at any political price will be recog-
nised in Canberra as being worthy of
recognition, “Labor,” as led by Mr.
Chifley, must be thrown out of office. It
is preposterous—and shameful to Aus-
tralia—that this larrikin Government
should be in office.
Wool Prices.
Concerned at the falling in American
wool yields, the U.S. Government will
pay 20,000 dollars annually for four
years to a scheme designed to improve
the textures of woollen manufactures.
Among other things, it is hoped eventually
to reduce the price of woollen cloth-
ing to the American people, and the
sponsors—American Wool Council, In-
ternational Wool Secretariat and Prince-
ton Textile Research Institute —believe it
will stimulate American wool production.
That, production, incidentally, is at its
lowest point for 25 years, though Ameri-
can demand for woollen goods is rising
steadily. The International Wool Secre-
tariat, to which Australia is a subscriber,
is to add 30,000 dollars annually to the
programme, total cost of which is ex-
pected to run into 75,000 dollars a year.
American growers and manufacturers
are expected to make up the balance.
Through the 1.W.5., Australia is actu-
ally a cash supporter of this scheme, and,
in the long view, it’s a good thing.
American consumer interest in wool re-
ceived a tremendous stimulus during the
recent war, when millions of Americans
wore military woollen garments and dis-
covered them to be the best all-round
wearing apparel. Maintaining and
stimulating that interest might become
rather difficult if the American wool-
grower were allowed to fade out of the
picture. It is to the Australian growers’
interest to step up American wool pro-
duction, as no matter how high it goes
the demand for the better-quality Aus-
tralian wools will march with it.
For their part, the Americans are con-
cerned at the ruling high prices at Aus-
tralian wool sales, which are up 15 to
20 p.c, since September because of large
buying by France, Italy, the U.K. and
Russia. A new record of 12s. 2£d. per
lb. was made at Geelong last week.
Americans believe that, with the excep-
tion of Russia, European buyers of Aus-
tralian wool are doing it on money
borrowed from U.S.A., and are thus in-
flating world wool values at the expense
of American manufacturers and public.
n was here said months ago that wool
had become the best currency in the
world, and Mr. Chifley’s subsequent
“discovery” that some European coun-
tries were buying it to enable them to
resell for dollars was proof of that,
Meantime, the inevitable rise in prices
of woollen goods in Australia has
arrived. Mr. Finnan, the N.S.W. Prices
Minister, has made the typical Finnan
announcement that he will “resist” it,
though in the next breath he said prices
were bound to rise because of the with-
drawal of Federal subsidies. Mr. Finnan
can’t have it both ways. Nor can the
public. Actually, the county is holding
its prosperity largely because of high wool
prices, and high clothing prices are a
natural accompaniment, especially when
to the cost of raw material is added the
exaggerated cost of manufacture. As far
as the lifting of the Federal subsidy is
concerned, that is just another Chifley
method of punishing the people for re-
jecting his—and the Communists’ —
prices referendum last May.
Pity the Poor Whorfie!
One of the sops handed to Sydney
wharfies during the war in order to in-

of keeping the ships turning round was

call for the afternoon shift, of making
a second trip on the one rail ticket. The
cost of this contribution to appeasenient
was met by the N. S. Wales Government
CHRISTMAS GREETING.
Railways, which, means in these days of
railway deficits by Consolidated revenue,
which means by the taxpayers. Last week
the concession was withdrawn as part
of an attempt to cut down railway losses.
There was an immediate howl from the
waterfront, and a threat that only one
shift would be worked unless the war-time
concession was restored. Quoth the
wharfies’ president: “This will cause a
lot of trouble on the waterfront.”
There was a time when watersiders as
a class were underpaid, just as there was
a time when there was not sufficient work
offering to guarantee them all a reason-
able continuity of employment. Those
days are now only a memory, but union
members still enjoy, in a time of bountiful
employment, the benefits devised to meet
the shortcomings of a casual industry.
Many years ago when the 48-hour week
was general in industry an Arbitration
Court Judge laid it down that the hourly
rate of pay was based on the assumption
that the average wharfie could expect to
get only 30 hours’ employment a week.
Nowadays the job can hardly be called
casual employment —certainly not in
Sydney—but the benefit of that assump-
tion remains. At the current general-
cargo rate of 4s. lid. an hour a water-
sider on day-shift can earn £9 16s. Bd.
in a five-day week. And that is not to
mention overtime, which often runs out
at around 9s. an hour.
It is a rare thing for more men to be
offering than are required for the ships
in port, but when that does occur those
who miss being picked-up collect 12s.
“attendance money.” Actually the only
casual thing about the industry nowadays
is the attitude of the wharfies to their
job. Complaints of the slow turn-round
of ships are so frequent that they no
longer mean anything except that a slow
turn-round has become the normal turn-
round. “Fixer” Ashley, for one, seems to
accept this as inevitable, and the Prime
Minister recently explained it away in his
airy manner by saying that Sydney was
not a modern port. It was no more
modern in 1939 when ships loaded and
discharged their cargo in half the time
they do today.
The Sydney waterfront, in common
with many other branches of Australian
industry, suffers from the twin evils of
Communist control and the lack of the
will to work. As long as the Reds rule
the wharves reluctance to do a fair day’s
work will be encouraged. Outside Russia
the Communists do not believe in work.
Wren to Bradman.
As extensively advertised, and nothing to
pay, a John Wren cheque for £2OO was
among the gifts to Don Bradman in Mel-
bourne. In effect, a present to a sports-
man whose career is without a blemish
from a “sport” who has made a huge
fortune by exploiting the mania for
gambling, beginning with the lawless tote
he ran in the depression-hit Collingwood
of the ’nineties.
Bradman might either return the
money or offer it as the nucleus of a
fund for building a Home for Lost
Punters or one for Punch-drunk Pugilists,
knocked silly in Wren slugging-halls and
carefully excluded from N.S.W. “Labor’s”
workers’-compensation law. Don could
learn from harrowing facts presented by
a deputation to a flustered Sydney
“Labor” Minister that there are lots of
these poor devils about.
Wren is, of course, the “sport promoter”
who, according to a Sydney Sunday paper
(apparently trembling at its own
audacity), “took a hand in the Victorian
political mix-up” and whose “influence
caused extraordinary Labor - party
gyrations.” The “influence” led to
“discussions” on, among other things, a
“revival” of the C.P.-“Labor” alliance,
for “possibly a majority of Caucus” and
“some influential members of the Country
party owe the sport promoter big favors.”
What “big favors”? Well, “he has
helped a number of members into State
politics and'to keep them there.” And
“he wields political power” in Queens-
land as well as Victoria, nor have N. S.
Wales and Westralia escaped the “influ-
ence.”
Bradman disclaims any intention of
entering public life—which is a pity. Still,
he is as much concerned in its standard as
any other decent citizen ; and he could
help the standard of public life a lot by
openly refusing any “favor” from Wren.
The Persistent North.
Displaying little trust in Canberra and
not much more in any other southern
Government, the one in Brisbane coming
in that category, “N.Q. Register” lines up
North Queensland’s experience in the
big transport strike with Comrade Elliott’s
sea-blockade of Victoria last month to
bring before North Queenslanders the
fact that they’re liable to suffer again
at any tick of the clock.
The Victorian trouble demonstrated a
number of interesting lessons, but foremost
is that a sudden blockade could again
sweep essential foodstuffs from N.Q. tables.
Mr. Chifley proved with the Queens-
land transport strike, and now the Victorian
dispute, that he would make no effort to
send relief by way of shipping.
The “Register” sees in this a call to
the North to become at least partly self-
sufficient, and suggests the establishment
of wholesale grocery concerns, branch
food factories and so forth. This may
prompt somebody to urge creation of
the new State, but since existing States,
with all their powers, are liable to be
blockaded by Communist-led unions, with
little hope of help from Canberra, it is
doubtful if a new State would improve
that particular condition. The “Register”
remarks that not much “concern was felt
in the south when incredible hardships
and food shortages were inflicted upon
North Queensland” —meaning Govern-
mental concern, and in that it is prob-
ably right.
Meantime the North has been hit
again, this time by a rise in Queensland
coastal ship freights of 17s. a ton, the
17s. to be doubled where a cargo is
transhipped, say, at Cairns for Innisfail,
when it would be 345.; 10s. a ton has
been slapped on raw sugar. Shipowners,
faced with rising costs and the continued
slow turn-round of their vessels, have had
no alternative. On one trip alone, Bris-
bane-Maryborough-Bundaberg - Brisbane,
a ship lost nearly £4OOO. On general
cargo, the rate per ton from Brisbane
is now 645. to Gladstone, 695. to Rock-
hampton and Mackay, 765. to Towns-
ville, 89s. 6d. to Cairns. To lesser ports,
where transhipment occurs, the rates are
from 1365. to Lucinda Point to 1475. 6d.
to Goondi. Road and rail freights have
to be added by inland towns.
In the Far North .clothing shortages
are pronounced, particularly singlets, etc.,
for children, and towels. A meeting at
Mareeba decided to consult Senator Ash-
ley, the Minister for Supply and Shipping
in Canberra, about it, but whether “The
Fixer” can fix this job remains to be seen.
Mareeba also complains that its aero-
drome could be used, but isn’t. Everybody
up north wants to see a cement works
started at Chillagoe, and the North is con-
tinually trying to attract both Brisbane
and Canberra to its continued neglect.
However, a bright spot has appeared.
Mr. Riordan, the Navy Minister, has in-
formed a mining association that he
“hopes shortly to advise as to a visit”
from Mr. Ward, the Transport Minister,
to discuss building a far-northern railway.
Mr. Ward is for the moment tied up with
rather pressing business down south, but
doubtless when that is cleared up he
will head for the Gulf country. Anyhow,
there’s to be a meeting of northern public
bodies convened at Georgetown, and
since Federal members are always apt
to be attentive when a lot of voters get
together in an angry mood it seems
certain to at least extract a promise or
two. The North has been living on
promises for half a century, and the
events of 1942-45 in the seas and islands
further out have made it very much aware
that promises are no defence when a
determined enemy heaves in sight.
Infecting Us with Culture.
“C.S.”: A sort of evangel has broken out
in Sydney which proposes, by some means
or other, to convert overnight that city’s
citizens and the rest of Australia to
“culture.” The evangelists don’t seem to
be sure who is to blame or what ought
to be done about our lack of culture,
though it is certain that scolding the
people and the Governments won’t
achieve much.
The State systems of “free and com-
pulsory education” are too concerned
with training children to earn a living—
so are the children’s parents, speaking
generally—for any great development of
the arts or appreciation thereof. Almost
all Australians are workers, whether as
pick-and-shovel men or as directors of
big businesses, and your daily worker
seldom has the time for artistic develop-
ment. Our art galleries and museums
close their doors when the civil-service
working-day ends; the great Sydney
Public Library is open to 10 p.m., but is
not easy to get at by suburban dwellers
after their daily work.
A working population is not a patron
of the arts, and Australia has no large
leisured class with the money and time
to spend on encouraging culture. Even
the 40-hour week has effected no change
—Leftists and Comrades notwithstand-
ing. There is, too, a strong national in-
serted snobbery which causes “clever
people” to be regarded with suspicion,
if not downright dislike. And Australia
has suffered from its distance from the
cultural centres of Europe, its insular
form of thought and its reluctance to wel-
come new citizens.
A noticeable thing about European
arrivals in Australia is their appetite for
the things of the mind. Not so many
Australians have it, simply because they
have no centuries of cultural tradition
behind them and because their insularity
and so-called “democratic” spirit tends
to make them sneer at that sort of thing.
“Shakspeare! I got enough of that
blankard at school,” is a fair summary
of the particular attitude.
It has been the fate of Australians to
be brought up in an isolated country,
most of them somewhat scared by the
size of it and eager to huddle together

in one or two large seaports, and to be-
come overgoverned and overpoliticised
before they were 100 years old as a
people. And lacking that constant im-
pulse of new, clever, educated blood
which assisted American culture, they
have also to contend, from a cultural
point of view, with their climate.
Climate is most important in this mat-
ter. In Europe and America the people
face long, dark winters. Driven indoors
for part of every year, it was natural for
them to turn in upon themselves, which
is the soil from which culture springs. The
Australian, whose winters are mostly
better than the European summers, is an
outdoor creature. He reads when he
can’t do anything else; he attends an art
show because it is fashionable to do so;
he seeks entertainment rather than in-
struction for his money.
As for the Governments: with the best
intentions in the world they can do no-
thing for culture unless the right soil is
in the hearts of the people. In other
countries wealthy men subscribe to the
arts and lesser people follow them. Here
the Governments set out to see, by taxes
and crushing death-duties, that nobody
has any money to patronise the arts. And
we have no landed gentry committed to
patronage of the arts by tradition.
A lot more could be said about it; the
truth is that, considering their many
handicaps, Australians haven’t done so
badly in culture. One hope of a sudden
improvement is to invite Mr. Calwell to
round up as many intelligent Europeans
(non-Communists) as he can and to give
them a welcome when they get here. It
will take a decided revolution in Aus-
tralian thought to bring that about,
Meantime, it is a healthy sign that the
evangel is—er—evangelising. If it could
shake off its political parasites it might
become a lusty animal*
POLITICAL POINTS
Victorian “Labor” doesn’t seem to
have gained anything from last week’s
motion of no-confidence in the Hollway
Liberal Government. Had they sat pat
Parliament would have gone into recess
without the Government knowing whether
the Country party, now the official Oppo-
sition, was a genuine Opposition or not.
It now knows that the answer is “not,”
Attempts that will undoubtedly be made
during the three months’ recess to heal
the breach between the two anti-Socialist
parties will be strengthened by the know-
ledge that the Country party does not
want an election and that there is no
great division on policy between it and
the Liberals. During recess “Labor” will
have to face the Prahran by-election, at
which the main issue will of necessity be
the Essential Services Act.
The sudden illness of N.S.W. Acting-
Premier Baddeley put Clive Evatt tem-
porarily in charge of the Macquarie-street
talking-shop, McGirr being somewhere in
the Indian Ocean. There was a flurry in
the party-room, with some mutinous
murmurings, and for a while it seemed
that a rocket-plane might be sent to whisk
the McGirr back from the mid-ocean
comfort of the mail-steamer. The excite-
ment died down with probably no worse
effects than giving Clive another line to
add to his biography in the next issue of
Who’s Who in Australia.
Playing his favorite role of Abe Lin-
coln sans whiskers, the P.M. told the
House in support of the pensions grab:
I have lost all my superannuation and
I could never go back to the job I was in
before I entered Parliament —a first-class
enginedriver. I would have to start at the
bottom again.
Leaving out of consideration (1) the cir-
cumstances in which the P.M. first lost
his seniority rights and had them
restored again, and (2) whether on enter-
ing Parliament he received a refund of
money he had paid into the Railway
Superannuation Fund, and if so whether
he did the sensible thing and invested it
in insurance, it seems reasonable to ask
what pension a first-class enginedriver
would be entitled to if he retired at 45
after eight years’ service.
Last week a Minister of the Crown,
who had been a prominent witness in a
graft inquiry, announced his intention of
resigning. Ten people chosen at random
in a Sydney street all picked the wrong
name. It was J. W. Belcher, Parlia-
mentary Secretary to the Board of Trade.
Asked why Australia had voted at
U.N.O. against a Canadian resolution
urging the appointment of a Palestine
Commission, which was supported by the
United States and Britain, Chifley passed
the buck to Evatt, adding:
The mere fact that Britain or the United
States or someone else holds certain views
is no reason why we should just fall in
with them.
Right enough, but unfortunately it seems
to be too often taken as a reason why
“we” should fall out with them.
The Canadian Montreal “Star” had a
little to say on this subject. Claiming
that an Australian delegate had com-
plained that “whatever is fixed up by the
great Powers had more importance in
Canada’s eyes than matters decided by the
smaller Powers,” the “Star” remarked:
Big Powers are so called because they
have power which the small nations do not
possess. If Canadians show appreciation
of that fact and realistically accept it, they
have, we think, more brains than people
who like to stand on their dignity and play
big, when they are not.
In other words Canada bases its foreign
policy on commonsense. Australia’s,
under the leave-it-to-Bert regime, is based
on whims and prejudices springing largely
from an outsize inferiority complex.
In B. 6/10/’4B, in the course of an
article dealing with diplomatic privileges
granted to travelling Federal Parliamen-
tarians (and, in some cases, to their wives),
there was political comment based on
a London cable (dated Sept. 26 and pub-
lished in the Brisbane and Adelaide press)
which stated, inter alia, that “Mr.
Mulcahy, and his wife, who
are not in the official party, were also said
to possess diplomatic passports.” This
was at the time of the visit of
the Australian delegation to the Empire
Parliamentary Association in London.
Mr. Mulcahy, on his return from Britain,
has informed The Bulletin: “My wife
has been deceased 17 years, and I
travelled to England alone.” The Bul-
letin regrets its error, which arose
through the error in the cabled story,
and is sorry if the reference to his wife
has caused distress to Mr. Mulcahy,
Mr. Teasdale, of the Australian Wheat
Board, has announced that N.S.W.
growers wilLget about 11s. 3d. a bushel
for under-quality wheat of last season.
It turned up after the wet summer last
year—thousands of bushels of shot and
sprung grain—and a separate pool was
created for it. Mr. Teasdale believes that
had there been no A.W.B. growers would
have found this wheat hard to sell.
Maybe; but poultry-farmers didn’t find
it any easier to buy.
When it was announced that the price
of the Holden car would be £675 plus
sales tax, McGirr’s Mr. Finnan hastened
to say that that might be the price fixed
for Victoria and South Australia, but
that nothing the price-fixing authorities in
those States did could have effect in his
State ; the Prices Commissioner in Sydney
would decide what was a fair price for
N. S. Wales. For a week would-be buyers
in the Ma State were kept in suspense on
the matter —a suspense shared by the dis-
tributors of the car. On Friday the an-
nouncement came. The N. S, Wales
price will be £675 plus sales tax.
When the “new” N.S.W. Legislative
Council was chosen by ballot of mem-
bers of the “old” Council and the
Assembly certain hardfaced individuals
got themselves elected by betting “sus-
ceptibles” £5O to nothing they wouldn’t
be. Thereupon ex-Minister Arthur
Griffith moralised in The Bulletin that
the “new” House would be “the best that
money can buy.” Strange how a good
jest is remembered and transplanted, A
Sydney “Telegraph” cable has it that
Londoners are saying, apropos of “the
Bribery Inquiry,” which has already
forced the resignation of a “Labor”
Minister —Belcher, Parliamentary Secre-
tary to the Board of Trade —“There’s
nothing wrong with this Government —
it’s the best that money can buy.”
Federal “Labor” doesn’t seem to have
overmuch sympathy for the man on the
way out. According to a “Sydney Morn-
ing Herald” report of the pensions de-
bate Maxie Falstein tried repeatedly to
get the call, and succeeded at last only
by staring-out the P.M. when he rose to
close the debate:
This was the signal for a chorus led by
Labor members of “Sit down, sit down.”
Mr. Pollard called to Mr. Falstein: “You
wouldn’t know what was happening if the
House fell on you.” He added, “You
are only here one day a week. We want
to get home.” Mr. Pollard and Mr. Shee-
han interrupted Mr. Falstein at three-
minute intervals with calls of “Time.”
First-fruit of the runaway “Labor” win
at the Sydney municipal elections was a
barney over who was to wear the Lord
Mayoral robes with the concomitant
honorarium of £2500 a year, tax-free.
Alderman O’Dea, who was on the Council
when it was obliterated 21 years ago and
has been on it ever since its resuscitation
in 1930, was the first claimant; hot on
his heels were Aldermen Carroll, Bodkin
and Minogue, the first-named following
up his nomination with a project
for a super-modern municipal hotel
for Sydney. O’Dea was reported as
claiming that the job was his by right, as
he had led the party campaign. From
other contenders came the howl “Who
said he led us?” After a day or so public
argument died down, and when this went
to the printer Caucus was trying to make
up its mind.
From the A.A.P. report of the break-
ing-up of U.N.O.’s noisy and futile con-
vention: —
Mr. Vyshinsky described Dr. Evatt as
“a great world leader, the best United
Nations President.”
That ought to finish Mr. Chifley’s india-
rubber Minister if nothing else does.
A procession of Eureka Youth dupes
and members of Communist-controlled
unions marched through Melbourne to
celebrate the 94th anniversary of Eureka
Stockade. A replica of the Eureka
banner was carried alongside the Russian
flag, and Communist Gibson delivered a
ranting speech which would have been
so much double-Dutch to the men of
Eureka. What these asses don’t realise
and their masters wilfully ignore is that
the Ballarat miners were not Communists
or Socialists, but rugged individualists to
a man. The aim of every one of them
was to make a lucky strike for himself,
and if a Gibson or a Sharkey or a Thorn-
ton had come among them preaching
Communism he’d have been chucked
down the nearest abandoned shaft. Their
leader, Peter Lalor, lived to be execrated
as a dyed-in-the-wool Tory. The old
boy would have grinned at the thought
of a “Labor” Government naming a
Federal electorate after him.
N. S. Wales Local Government Minister
Cahill, putative father of the Act which
handed over Sydney City Council to
“Labor” and also of the provision in the
Act making voting compulsory, was asked
by reporters whether he proposed to do
anything about prosecuting non-voters —
at the municipal elections on December
4 they were legion. “The law lays down
that voting is compulsory. It is for Local
Government to administer that law. I
cannot dictate to Local Government what
it is to do.” For years Cahill has been
trying to dictate not merely what the
councils should do, but which should live
or die.
Yampi Sound came back into the news
last week when a cable from Tokyo an-
nounced that Japan might soon renew
her pre-war attempts to obtain a mining
concession over iron-ore deposits in n.-w.
Australia. Whereupon “a Federal
official” was quoted as saying that the
granting of concessions to mine ore in
West Australia was a matter for the
State Government. The granting of con-
cessions may be, but the granting of
permits to export the ore is a matter
for Canberra. Back in 1938 a West
Australian “Labor” Government gave
permission for an English syndicate co-
operating with Japanese interests to ex-
ploit the Yampi deposits, but the Lyons
Government stopped the project by ban-
ning the export of iron-ore. When the
ban was announced Mr. Curtin, then
leader of the Opposition, protested in
Parliament; Mr. Ward, then a member
of the Lang group in the Reps., gave
grudging approval to the Lyons Govern-
ment’s action, but doubted its motives.
He implied that the Government had
acted at the behest of “the British Im-
perialist Government.” Three years later
both Mr. Curtin and the West Australian
Government had good reason to be
pleased that the Japs had not been allowed
to get a foothold in the Nor’-west.
According to “S. M. Herald” a 21-
year-old Sydney girl, a Miss Swayne, a
former C.S.LR. employee, answered an
advertisement in a Sydney paper and
found herself offered a typist’s job in
Moscow with the Joint Press Reading
Service, “a combined Allied organisation
with a large office.” Miss Swayne, who
speaks Russian, told a reporter that “the
Department of External Affairs has
arranged for me to fly to England, and
from there I will go to Russia.” She
will remain there a year and then return
to Sydney. She’d better not go anywhere
else, unless she asks Mr. Calwell first.
Under the N.S.W. Wheat Stabilisation
Bill, which is complementary to the
Federal bill, Wheat Board officials have
the right of entry to private premises to
inspect such premises and of
account or documents.” The N.S.W.
Country party tried to have that amended
to make it necessary for the officials to
obtain search warrants, but the McGirrs
wouldn’t have it. So a bunch of civil ser-
vants gets more power than a police officer.
A lot of capricious females have,
according to an Albury paper, upset the
Prime Minister’s plans for “Empire
economic recovery”:
While in America, it was disclosed to-
day [3/12/’4B], Mr. Chifley entered into
an arrangement to save dollars by import-
ing silk from Japan. No sooner had he
returned to Australia than Australian
women switched their preference to nylons,
and imports of manufactured nylon hosiery
had to be authorised from Britain.
These imports grew so much that now
the Government has arranged for big
imports of nylon thread for manufacture
in Australia. Apart from the disclosure
of Mr. Chifley’s whereabouts during his
trip abroad, the item should convey to
women (a) their economic power, ( b )
their thoughtlessness in upsetting the plans
of an Empire-builder, and (c) the Prime
Minister’s interest in satisfying their —
er —whims.
Wharfies up at Mackay (N.Q.) refused
to work overtime on the ground that
meals provided for them by shipowners
were no good. The “dispute” was re-
ferred to the Stevedoring Industry Com-
mission, while ships lay idle at the wharf.
The wharfies said they’d work overtime
if the owners would transport them and
pay travelling-time for a four-mile there-
and-back journey to a city cafe. Then
the owner of the cafe at the wharf de-
clared the wharfies black. It was still
“on” when this went to the printer, and
probably has something to do with the
Christmas spirit—or has it?

"AND IT'S PRINTED

“Spokeshave” on the Victorian switch-
over : —•
I feel sorry for the poor professional poli-
tician. It seems that either because Mr. Hollway
is a political scallywag and has double-crossed
good Albert Dunstan, or because Albert
is a ditto blackguard and has done the
dirty on that true and just man Mr.
Hollway, poor well-intentioned honorable
Mr. Cain, leader of the Labor party in
the Victorian Assembly, will go down £5OO
on his allowance as Leader of the Opposition
to a beggarly £1250, though the blow will be
softened by a bill which will raise the third
party’s leader’s allowance by £l5O. At the same
time, the £5OO which formerly went into Mr.
Cain’s pocket will go into the pouch of Mr.
McDonald, who, as Leader of the Opposition,
will draw £1650 per annum for opposing the
policy he himself helped to make when a
Minister of the Hollway Government, for which
he drew £2500, plus a car and a chauffeur.
Surely it would be difficult for any statesman
in such a situation to maintain what little
was left of his dignity after Mr. Hollway’s
description in the House of the scene which
preceded a previous reshuffle of political
appointments. According to Hollway, Dunstan
had haggled for hours over his status in the
Cabinet, and McDonald, his leader, kept run-
ning between his room and the Premier’s.
“Sometimes,” says Mr. Hollway, “he went out
through my door, and the pressmen waiting
outside were a little surprised to find him
moving in an anti-clockwise instead of a
clockwise direction.” The explanation was
that, as it was feared that McDonald’s fre-
quent comings and goings would rouse the
“Any chance of that lid falling shut?”
pressmen’s suspicions, it was decided that, as
the two rooms were adjoining, the two leaders
should open their windows and McDonald
should make his entries and exits that way,
Eventually it was suggested that Dunstan him-
self should come and discuss the matter with
Hollway. “Did you have any trouble getting
him to come?” asked Mr. Cain. “No,” said
Mr. Hollway. “As a matter of fact, he came
in through the window.”

“C.E.G.”: What became of all the
hansom cabs which formerly graced the
streets of Melbourne? The city once
boasted a fleet of over a thousand
horse-drawn cabs; today about 20 pro-
vide a precarious living for their owners,
The hansom was an elegant vehicle, and
to see one discharging its passenger at
the Melbourne Club was a fine sight,
with its varnish and paintwork sparkling
under the old arc-lamps which used to
splutter their somewhat purple light in
Collins-street. The business of alighting
gave the commissionaires at the better
hotels a chance to earn a tip as they
ostentatiously placed a wicker guard over
the tyre of the wheel to protect my lady’s
dress. Brass lamps and metal fittings
brightly polished, shining windows and
clean white linen covers over the seat
and back, and the horse well groomed
with shining harness make the word
elegant indeed apt. Melbourne’s wide
and spacious streets were particularly
suited to the hansom. The cabbies them-
selves were a feature of Melbourne life
in the naughty ’nineties. Although
the cab occupants may have been
snug inside (they were ideal for lovers),
the cabby, perched on his precarious-
looking seat and looking over the top
of the cab as he drove, had no protection
from the weather except his mackintosh.
The “fare’s” orders were taken through a
little trap-door in the roof.

“Hamer”: The police of the period
weren’t much concerned at the semi-
nudity of Chidley (B. 27/10/’4B) ; what
they objected to was the dissemination
of the sex theories he promulgated in
The Answer. If “\V.P.T.” thinks that
“today it might almost be read in Sun-
day-schools,” he must have a queer idea
of the literature favored by such places.
Chidley’s idea was that the “answer”
to all human troubles was the propaga-
tion of the species in a sort of free love,
with the impulse coming from the
woman. Girls were enjoined to grab
the man for whom they felt a fascina-
tion and, if possible, become the mother

objected to Chidley’s habit of selling his
volume to teen-age girleens, whom he
regarded as his most likely proselytes.
Chidle’y’s release was granted on giving a
bond that he would refrain from selling
his book to the immature, but a few days
later he was caught trying to sell to
young girls in a Y.W.C.A. hostel. Chid
was rearrested —his disciples called it his
“martyrdom.”

“Macnell”; A press photograph of a
British migrant recently arrived in the
Asturias featured his fighter-pilot mo,
with the caption that it was “a relic of
his* service in the Royal Navy.” It must
be a relic of his beard, as regulations for-
bid moustache without beard, and vice
versa. In the King’s Navy it’s 1 all or
nothing. Extant since sailing-ship days
and still in use, King’s Regulations and
Admiralty Instructions, on which the life
of a sailor directly depends, ordain;
The Captain is to permit all the officers
and men of the ship, including the Royal
Marines, to wear beards and moustaches
if they so desire.
When the permission is taken advantage
of, the use of the razor is to be discon-
tinued entirely, as moustaches are not to
be worn without the beard.
The hair of the beard and moustaches or
whiskers is to be kept well cut and trimmed.
The Captain is to give such directions as
may seem to him desirable upon these
points, and is to establish, as far as is
practicable, uniformity as to the length
of the hair, beard, moustache or whiskers
of the men.

“Fa’a Samoa”: Anyone tried lately to
get hold of books on Polynesia from any
of the public libraries? Usually there is
a long waiting-list, and in many cases it
is useless to try to secure some of the
best books—they have been stolen.
Owners of private collections are also
wailing about cherished volumes on the
subject being missing. I’ve been given a
clue in a letter from a friend in America.
He mentions that many second-hand
books from Britain and Australia are now
arriving in the U.S.A., some of them
valuable first editions, and that there is
also a big demand there for books deal-
ing with the Pacific. This suggests the
following (1) Some people are securing

no second-hand books on Polynesia in

a few American books into Australia,
and could instead open some parcels to
see what is going out of Australia,

“Eureka”: On December 28 will be
celebrated the centenary of the laying of
the foundation-stone of one of the
prettiest little churches in Australia—the
Church of the Holy Innocents at Ross-
more, between Liverpool and Bringelly
(N.§.W.). Built in Gothic style of brick
with stone facings to the windows, it
stands on a hill off the Bringelly road
and in a pretty setting. The steep-roofed
church is in a splendid state of preserva-
tion, and the traveller is surprised to see
such a fine church in such a sparsely-
settled district. The graves of many early
identities in the Cowpastures district are
to be found in the churchyard. There is
one “headstone” of Australian hardwood
that has weathered remarkably.

new carriers will be distinguished by fea-

buttering machines. A new anchor,
specially designed to hold ships with
large windage areas, has been found by
naval constructors to be four times as
efficient as the present standard stockless
mud-hook. The new type can hold a
pull of more than eight times its own
weight. This, added to the enormous
frictional drag of a big ship’s heavy chain
laid along the bottom, should hold a
carrier in anything short of a hurricane.
Ships in the Normandy landings used
Admiralty - type anchors (the old-
fashioned killick with sharp flukes and a
stock) to kedge or drag themselves off
the beaches. Now a 750-pounder of this
type capable of holding 20 times its
weight has been developed.
“Alter Ego”: “Macnell” (B. l/12/’4B)
explains why ships of the R.A.N. flew
only masthead flags and fired 21 guns
on the occasion of the Royal birth, but
the R.A.'N. is not the only service in
Australia. As one of the “self-appointed
authorities” who “rushed into print,” I
would point out that a 41-gun salute is
customary from a shore battery on such
an occasion, and that, as according to
the cables other Dominions accorded the
infant prince this courtesy, Australia, for
once, “was not there.”

“Spinet”; Smoking, is it (B.

after their death were opened,” But his
warning went unheeded by addicts of
“A custom loathsome to the eye, hateful
to the nose, harmful ‘to the brain,
dangerous to the lungs, and in the black
stinking fume thereof nearest resembling
the horrible Stygian smoke of the pit that

“Fitz”: An elderly, lanky, sunburnt fellow,
he came into Room 13 on the Editorial floor
of The Bulletin and placed on my desk a
faded postcard inscribed in fancy lettering:
“Fraternal Greetings from The Bulletin Com-
panionship, Xmas, 1891.” Surrounding the
text was a circle of photographs of eight
Bulletin compositors. “That chap,” said the
visitor, pointing to one of the photos, “is Bill
East, who was boss of the comps,” and, tracing
a finger clockwise, he continued, “That’s Ted
Rose, Healy, Joe Jones, Jim Brooks, Fred
Davis, Tom Reynolds and me. I was a stripling
then, and Bill East painted a mo on my top
lip to make me look like the others.” The
caller was Walter Martin, a cheerful old-
timer who joined The Bulletin in the ’eighties
as a printer’s devil and who stayed with the
firm for seven years. I took him down to the
composing-room, where Ray Ormes, The
Bulletin’s foreman-compositor, who has been
with the paper for 41 years and knew East,
Brooks and Reynolds, dug up an old pay-
book which revealed that Walter Martin
in those faraway days received ten bob
whenever the ghost walked. Walter stayed for
a yam with the stone-hands as they locked-up
a few pages of this Christmas number before
sending the formes to the stereo-room. Back
in the Editorial department the 1891 Christmas
number of The Bulletin was produced. “A
jolly good issue,” said Mr. Martin. “I had a
hand in setting it up.” The yellowed pages
were turned. There was a colored drawing by
Percy Spence entitled “Bliss,” showing a bearded
horseman reading The Bulletin. “Banjo” Pater-
son was represented by a Snowy River verse and
his humorous piece about “The Stranger to
Walgett Town”; Henry Lawson by “Ben
Duggan” and “The Shanty on the Rise.” Other
poets were Barcroft Boake, who, writing under
the nom-de-plume of “Surcingle,” had a trio
of rhymes, “Where the Dead Men Lie,” “Kitty
McCrae” and “Kelly’s Conversion,” and Ed-
mund Fisher, Victor Daley (“Creeve Roe”), Tom
Freeman, Ernest Favenc and Annie Glenny
Wilson. There were a dozen or more short
stories, among them some that reached the
anthologies in later years by James Edmond,
Francis Adams, “Price Waning,” “Scotty -the
Wrinkler,” Harry Cargill (“The Dipso”), and
Mannington Caffyn. The artists who con-
tributed to the issue included Phil May, “Hop,”
Percy Spence, A. H. Fullwood, George Ash-
ton and B. E. Minns. Among the advts. for
Monk Ale and Foster’s Lager Beer was one
from Geo. Kaufman, of Sydney, offering a case
of 12 quarts of champagne for £3. “Ah! Those
were the days!” I said, smacking my lips.
“They were,” said Mr. Martin, “Not that I
could afford champagne on ten bob a week.”

left their golf-club together the other
Saturday night, intending to go to Har-

Hurley on the way, and he led them into

with the result that when a taxi

Harrison’s place later on
neither was too sure of him-
self. Harrison isn’t married,
and lives with his mother and
brother. A believer in the
open-air way, he occupies a

When he and McClintock felt
their way to the house it was
locked up and in darkness, so
Harrison led Me. to the back
verandah and they disrobed as
best they could and got into
Harrison’s bed. Time passed. Harrison
awoke to find the moon shining upon
him and became conscious of a coldness
about his feet. He looked at the foot of
the bed and saw four feet sticking out
of the blankets. He rolled out, felt his
way about the floor, located his matches,
weaved a wavering course to the foot
of the bed, struck a match and peered
closely. “Tha’s ri’,” he assured himself.
“For a moment, be cripes, I thought I
saw four of ’em. But two’s ri’; two’s

“L.P.”: All this talk of a Golden Age
and a bulging pay-envelope makes me
feel good until I cast my mind back to
the bad old days of sweat and misrule.
Those bad old days when there was noth-
ing to eat (but as much as you wanted);
nothing to smoke or drink (only what
you fancied); nothing in the shops to
buy (but whatever you were willing to
pay for). Those bad old days when there
was nowhere to live —but where you
pleased; when sausages were made of
meat and beer of malt; when the only
shoes you could buy were those that
lasted until you were sick of them. Those
tough old times before price-control
“We'll take our time over this case.”
\yhen threepence would buy a pound of
chops or sausages, a loaf of bread, a pint
of beer or a packet of fags. Tough days,
those. No social services and little taxa-
tion. The harder you worked the more
you earned, and what you earned was all
yours in those bad old days when a quid
had real purchasing-power.

“Clericus”; In the opinion of a
Lutheran minister, the “Hollywood em-
brace” at the conclusion of marriage
ceremonies in church is in bad taste. Rev.
Frank Bauer told a conference of minis-
ters of his church that he was still young
enough to regard, kissing fayorably
within its legitimate bounds. “But,” he
added, “any public display of affection,
particularly in the church, is in bad taste.
There is no place in the liturgical warrant
for the Hollywood embrace. Nor does
the minister who is tempted to kiss the
bride himself have a liturgical, to say
nothing of moral, right.” Instead, said
Mr. Bauer, a kiss on the cheek was pre-
ferable, being illustrative of brotherly
rather than marital love,

“Becks”; Drawing and quartering (B.
8 /12/ ’48)? A 8.8. C. broadcast which
mentioned that no one had been sentenced
to this punishment since 1820 brought a
letter to the London “Times” from
Edward Donough O’Brien claiming that
his great-great-uncle, William Smith
O’Brien, M.P. for Ennis and Limerick,
had the sentence passed on him on
October 7, 1848, for leading a minor re-
bellion “known to Irish history as the
battle in ‘Widow McCormack’s Cabbage
Garden’.” There was a recommendation
that the sentence be commuted to trans-
portation to Van Diemen’s Land, but
O’Brien, wanting no clemency, protested
that “the Government had no power to
force him to accept their mercy.” So
strongly did he maintain this attitude that
a special Act of Parliament was passed
“to remove doubts concerning the trans-
portation of offenders under judgment of
death to whom mercy may be extended
in Ireland.” O’Brien spent a few years
in Tasmania, was pardoned, returned to
Ireland, but took no further part in poli-
tics. The present O’Brien claims that
while in Tasmania he wrote a monograph
“on which I believe the future Constitu-
tion of the Commonwealth of Australia
was based.”

“Spoggie”; As a native-born sparrow
whose forebears have been resident in
Australia for upwards of 100 generations,
let me lodge an emphatic protest against
the claim of Dr. Lytle S. Adams, of
U.S.A., to have discovered a new way
of reclaiming semi-desert land. The
cables tell me he proposes to drop from
the air “pellets made of dry, compressed
loam, clay and fertiliser, each containing
a few grass seeds,” the idea being that
the seeds will germinate and cause the
desert to blossom like the rose. It is
typical of featherless bipeds to make a
song about nothing. If this man’s scheme
is successful, mark my chirrups, he’ll be
hailed as a benefactor of mankind, yet
my tribe has been doing the self-same
thing for longer than we can remember,
seeking no credit and receiving nothing
but abuse for our efforts.

“Carlyle”; I can add some unofficial
notes to the early history of the Sydney
Council (B. 27/10/’4B). One of my aged
father’s earliest memories is of dodging
along “the Bub” from York-street into
the Town Hall grounds to see the
“tossed-in” foundations of the Centennial
Hall (1883), then the subject of a public
outcry. Later, as a cartage contractor,
he carried Borneo cedar from the wharf
to Bignell and Clark, sawmillers, Cam-
perdown, where it was cut into balus-
trades for the Centennial Hall. Later
again he carted away rpaterial excavated
for the hall portico, some of which—sent
to Tasmania as ballast in the barque
Nautilus —included bones from the old
burial-ground. One Council job which
landed him in trouble was the removal
of stones and clay from excavations in
York-street, where the “round house”
(police-court, watchhouse and law
courts) was demolished to make way for
the George-street Markets. Instructions
from the Council were that the material
should be dumped near Sanders’ old
quarry, Pyrmont; execution of the order
brought an action against the Council
for depositing rubbish and trespassing.
My dad was subpoenaed and attended
court, but although paid 30s. for the
day he was not called to the stand—
which was not surprising, since he had
warned the Council, “It’s no use calling
me. The only evidence I’ll give will be
against you!”
MAYORAL APPAREL.
“Labor having recaptured control of the Sydney
City Council, two candidates for the Lord
Mayoralty have announced that whichever of them
is elected will refuse to wear the robes and chain
that go with Jhe office.”
That “the apparel oft proclaims the man”
Shakspeare made old Polonius declare,
But where our city dads their laws are framing
One may assume ’twill shortly cease proclaiming
Who fills the Mayoral chair.
These sturdy demagogues about to run
The show regard, we’re told, such things as
these,
Robes trimmed with ermine and the golden
chain
That rings the neck, with unconcealed disdain
As foppish fripperies.
What need for anyone to care a rap
Just what peacockery he wears outside
When deep within there beats a heart that passes
Hours of concern to help the struggling masses,
And glows with civic pride?
You still may place a cleric by his collar
Turned back to front, a sWagman by the
\ swag
He carries, by his uniform a copper,
A genuine patrician by his topper, jUfo
A bookie by his bag.
But a Lord Mayor, stripped of the age-old
trappings
We’ve looked upon so long and know so well.
Garbed like an ordinary Bumble merely,
Will hardly be so instantly and clearly
Identifiable.
Ah, well! They promise us a brighter Sydney,
But in the Hall where City Fathers gab,
In factious brawls perpetually engaging,
It seems that on the contrary the staging
Will only be more drab.

THE SERVICE MAN
Our Defence Collapse.
“Ek Dum”: The condition of
Australian defence has become
so serious in proportion to the
dangers which beset the world
that one stands aghast at the con-
templation of it.
The lame contention of the
leaders of the Government
that the next war will be a push-
button show, a war of scien-
tists —fought apparently by pro-
fessors, judging by one or two
of its recent appointments—is
merely cover for the fact that
it is in the hands of a unionist
section which is opposed to de-
fence in strength lest it might
have to be used against Soviet
Russia or against its fifth-column
here or elsewhere.
Chifley Ministers shudder
every time the subject of defence
has to be faced. The Federal
conference in September
abolished the plank forbidding
compulsory service outside the
Commonwealth, save by the
vote of the people, but this was
not evidence of any change of
heart.
There is an air of shirking and
unreality about almost every-
thing the Government does.
While its natural allies, the
British and the United States,
have systems of compulsory
training, it fails to live up to its
responsibilities. While it
shrieked stridently its demands —
yes, demands —that British and
U.S. conscripts should be sent to
defend this country when it was
in danger in 1942, it flatly re-
fused to allow Australian con-
scripts to cross the Equator to
help defeat the Japanese, against
whom its attitude is now the
sternest and most uncompromis-
ing of any Western nation. Its
present belligerent attitude
would melt like snow in Decem-
ber if it were asked to send citi-
zen troops to impose the crush-
ing conditions which it believes
should govern Japan’s future.
Back from Japan
It is even bringing back most
of the small force which it now
has in Japan. The Americans
would welcome the continuance
and maintenance of a brigade of
Australian troops in Japan, pro-
vided they were there for work
and not for show. And from
the point of view of our own de-
fence it would be a magnificent
thing, especially if the force
were integrated with the Ameri-
can forces so ’that our officers
and men could learn by close-
knit contact and practical experi-
ence about American military
technique, temperament, equip-
ment, transport and methods.
This, however, does not seem
to be possible at present. One
of the reasons why the 8.C.0.F.
is being withdrawn is that it
seems to be difficult to keep the
battalions and their ancillaries
at present strength even under
the prevailing conditions of ser-
vice, under which much of the
toil is done by procured Jap-
anese mechanics, drivers, etc.,
and the troops live, in the main,
“the life of Riley.” If our
recruits were called on to serve
as some of the U.S. troops serve,
working hard and roughening
their hands, service would be
even more unpopular. In the
Australian force the main things
pointed out to visitors are the
wonderful standards of comfort
in which the troops live, their
fine appearance, the magnifi-
cence of their guards. Nobody
ever seems to unearth for the
stranger a piece of hard work
which is not administrative or
connected with supply.
Yet it would be a wonderful
nucleus to have a brigade group
complete and au fait with the
standards and methods of the
United States Army, with which
we will have to fight in World
War 111, when and if it comes.
The same applies to the
R.A.A.F., though its squadrons
in Japan have a different air to
the military forces —a down-to-
earth attitude probably due to the
need for living and working with
their aircraft and equipment, and
consequently an interest in their
military job which is not visible
in the military force. But two oj;
the three squadrons of R.A.A.F.
at Iwakuni have been withdrawn,
just as two out of the three so-
called battalions of the 34th
Brigade have been withdrawn
along with their command.
The position at the present
time is amazing and shameful,
especially when the efforts of the
Americans in the Pacific are so
obvious, and when every other
part of the British Common-
wealth is taking steps to have
something like a developed de-
fence integrated with that of its
neighbors at the earliest possible
moment.
In Africa a huge series of
supply depots is being laid down.
In Europe, in the Far East, in the
Philippines the United States is
preparing against eventualities.
But it is a sad fact that except
for little Maoriland the only
British Commonwealth troops fit
to fight and bar the way to Aus-
tralia from Asia at the moment
are those in the tiny force of
British now stationed in Malaya
and adjacent colonies. Our
Navy is obsolescent and utterly
undermanned, its efficiency
dying for want of officers, incap-
able of dealing with a long-
distance attack on modern lines.
The R.A.A.F. doesn’t exist as
a force worth the name. Save
for the squadrons in Japan there
isn’t any on a fightable basis.
And theirr equipment is so
precious that their fighters are
being tenderly brought home by
boat.
The Generals’ Appeal
Nothing better can be ex-
pected of a Ministry which rims
to six Defence Ministers and
whose Army Minister, when
bearded by a group of a bakers’
dozen of the country’s most ex-
perienced fighting generals, who
sternly pointed out the dangers
and needs of the situation, re-
marked :
If the Australian people, particu-
larly the young manhood, wish to
prepare themselves, then the proposed
citizen army will be filled.
If they do not wish to prepare,
no system, permanent force, or uni-
versal or voluntary training will be
a success.
That was said by a Minister
of a party which, in a panic,
grabbed every man and woman
in 1942 for civilian or military
service and gloried in its “ruth-
lessness,” many of its conscripts
being piled into comfortable
jobs and camps on wages far
higher than either the awards
provided or the fighting soldier
expected or obtained, with
special compensation for dis-
comfort or danger if they went
into the tropics or within about
500 miles of a point at which
they might hear a shot fired.
The Pattern of Defence
If war should come this
country is, at the moment,
almost defenceless. Its needs
would be immense. Even using
the whole of its resources it
could, in case of invasion, only
defend crucial areas, and then
only if there were fully-trained
and -armed personnel promptly
available and ready to go to
their posts.
The defence of Sydney and
Newcastle and the vital north
Illawarra areas, apart from sea
and air, would involve some-
thing like the following:
(a) Three or four solid
fortress islands of defence as
bases distributed to carry main
communications and particular
areas in which there were im-
portant plants ; ( b ) large mobile
forces, partly on land, partly in
the air—parachute, etc.—which
could be used for offensive de-
fence to break up major attacks
in particular directions; (c)
mobile armor, heavily gunned,
with some powerful swift-mov-
ing elements ; ( d) in between the
main fortress islands every man,
woman and child who could be
integrated into mobile civilian-
defence groups which would
cover the ground thoroughly and
be prepared for fire-bombs,
ordinary bombs, parachute
troops, ack-ack and a hundred
civilian and semi-civilian jobs ;
( e ) adequate reserve forces in a
detached situation. To allow
all these great defence ser-
vices to function effectively
there must be an organised plan,
especially of communications,
otherwise there would be no
hope of putting it into operation.
This means thorough training.
The general officers who wrote
their memorandum on defence
called for universal training of
all young manhood —at least six
months’ continuous training. The
socialist Government of Great
Britain, no martial band them-
selves, consider the period should
be put up from 12 months to
18 months.
The Citizen Forces
The state of recruiting for the
Citizen Forces at present is that
most of the battalions ’outside
the Scottish are two-thirds be-
low required strength. And the
goal of 50,000 doing a desultory
fortnight’s training in the year,
with two divisions and one
armored brigade group spread
over 3,000,000 square miles, is
ludicrous.
Contrast the scheme with
“Lucky it Was only a practice shell, sir !”
Canada’s, which is far more im-
portant, and even vital, to her
larger allies in the industrial
field, providing manufactures
metals and radioactive material,
as well as absorbing a consider-
ably greater proportion of its
manpower in the Navy than
Australia and inevitably being
the locale of a large air-training
scheme in war-time.
Its peace-time plan provides
for 26,200 regulars, with an
effective corps school for each
of the arms, an army component
for sharing in the administra-
tion of a joint air school, the
Canadian Army Staff College,
the Army Component helping to
administer the National Defence
College, resident officers at all
the universities for training
officer training-corps contingents
—this apart from research de-
partments in the various
branches.
Also, there is an establish-
ment of 200,000 men in what is
called a “reserve force,” which
does 30 days a year training and
which is dispersed to communi-
ties on a basis representing
roughly 2 per cent, of the civil
population with a divisional
grouping on a territorial basis.
Beside our two divisions and
one phantom armored-brigade
group, the Canadians have
organised four infantry divi-
sions, two armored divisions,
corps and selected troops
for an army of two corps, plus
two armored brigades and four
infantry-brigade groups with
coast and ack-ack units.
In addition there is a supple-
mentary reserve which approxi-
mates to a civil-defence force.
There is also a reserve militia
which is organised in the more
sparsely-settled north and west
and which does not receive pay
for its normal training.
One of the main differences
between the Australian and
Canadian schemes is that the
Canadian scheme is being
carried out.
Chaos in China.
“Ek Dum”: News from China
is vague, except in one particu-
lar: the Chiang Kai-shek Gov-
ernment is defeated, as far as
any Government can be defeated
in China. It has been left to
fight alone. During the war
every Communist was yelling his
head off for support for “the
united front” in China, At one
stage the propagarlda was even
to the effect that the only way
Japan could be defeated would
be by giving priority to the arm-
ing of China. Then came the
phase, when it was seen that the
Pacific War was as good as won,
in which the tune changed and
it was represented that the
Chinese Communists were the
real men from Galway and that
they had done all the fighting
while the Chiang Government
loafed in Chungking.
In both these phases a very
large section of the daily press,
as usual, followed the Red
gleam.
' Finally came the phase in
which it was agreed that all the
Allies should recognise the
Chinese Government’s right to
Manchuria and most of its re-
sources rescued .from the Japan-
ese. Russia was given Saghalien
and the Kuriles, Dairen and the
right to occupy Northern Korea.
Japanese prisoners of war were
to be sent home.
The Russians hastened to grab
their prizes—won by coming in
with a loud yell at the death.
They also stripped the northern
area of China, deeded to
Chiang’s Government by agree-
ment, and put the Communists
in possession, seeing them suffi-
ciently well entrenched to defeat
the war-worn Nanking armies
when they arrived.
Japanese prisoners of war were
kept and are only now being re-
turned to Japan when they have
served their purpose and When
as many as possible have been
indoctrinated with Communist
ideas. The Russians are now
allegedly moving out of Korea,
but only after they have left
there a completely-trained and
-armed Communist Government,
guided by Moscow’s agents, and
a fifth-column in the southern
American zone.
The Communist armies of
China, which were a rag-bag lot
as far as equipment went, sud-
denly developed large quantities
of transport and arms and they
are showing a fighting spirit and
proceeding according to methods
very like Russian military
methods both as to strategy and
tactics. If they developed these
themselves, they are very differ-
ent types from the rest of the
Chinese. Their technique is so
clear-cut and specific that there is
very little doubt that there are
brains and resources behind them
which are not Chinese.
Delusive Propaganda
Some “experts” accept the
shibboleth that the Commun-
ists of China are not really
Communists linked with Russia.
They are a different kind of
Communist, it is said, of the
same kind as those who operate
in Japan, Marxists withal, but
moderate fellows who believe
that enough is as good as a feast
and that private ownership, par-
ticularly of agricultural land,
should not be abolished but
that large estates should be
divided. , ,
Dr. Evatt’s Mr. Macmahon
Ball holds that “China’s only
hope is compromise.”
The only kind of compromise
possible would be the kind made
famous in the limerick about the
young lady of Niger.
Stalin’s Viewpoint
In his revelations of a Soviet
diplomat, Gregory Bessedovsky,
formerly charge d’affaires at
Tokyo, makes it clear that Soviet
policy in the Far East even 20
years ago was to “try by every
means in our power to intensify
the Chinese revolution, in order
to turn out the English and
threaten their position in India.”
The reason that Chinese Com-
munists advocate private enter-
prise is to get the peasants on
their side and to break up aggre-
gations of capital. When they
have done with that stage—
which was also a stage in the
Russian revolution —they will
declare all the peasants kulaks
and liquidate them.
Stalin told Bessedovsky before
he left for Tokyo in 1927 that
“a revolution in China was
already engaging Soviet atten-
tion ; the only thing that could
thwart it would be armed inter-
vention by the British”:
I am not a diplomat [said Stalin].
If the Soviets are successful in China
we can assure the safety of Japanese
(and give them the price of their
neutrality) even by giving up Irkutsk.
Brest-Litovsk will be repeated several
times more. The Chinese revolution
will need it just as much as the
Russian.
A Tito in China
Exactly the same processes are
taking place in China as have
been evolved elsewhere.
In 1939, in its closed con-
ference at Moscow, the Rus-
sian Communist party re-
ceived a report from its represen-
tatives in the Comintern which
made it clear what plans were in
China and that the Chinese party
was a Comintern section “steeled
and tempered in the fire of years
of civil war and war for national
emancipation” and “growing
fastest in the districts embraced
by the partisan movement in the
rear of the Japanese armies.”
The Chinese party was under
the same leader as at present.
Its aims are just the same as
those of Moscow, and it is un-
doubtedly subservient to the
orders and directions of Moscow.

SNOWBALL
BY
JAMES
HACKSTON
DOWN all the
years, we’d never
had snow, and
then, in our
hard, dry, dusty, sun-
baked part of the world
it was actually snowing.
At first it was a
novelty to see our old,
fire-scarred gums don
white hoods and our
familiar land changed
to a bewildering desert
of white.
But the novelty soon began to wear off.
Somehow, snow did not seem to suit our
part of the world, or suit us, either. We
had a dry temperament, a heat-fire-
drought complex.
As for snow, none of us had ever been
far enough away from our place to have
even seen snow. Except the English-
men, of course. There were three of
them. But even they, after a while, be-
came acclimatised. They used our
language in a fine, free, Australian way,
conjured up the memory of Mr. Kelly
during business discussions and lost all
vocal culture; for they spoke with that
fine, harsh tone of ours that was so sug-
gestive of our district; that hirsute ring
born of heat and fire and swallowing
flies —in season. And they had so
absorbed our ways that they could loaf
about the mullock-heaps with the best
of our local mullock-heap philosophers.
But the snow kept falling. Our dry,
burnt-out, cracked, sunblitzed, fire-
scarred district, where tanks dried ond
dams cracked, and where sugar-ants,
bull-ants, March flies, blowflies, flies,
snakes, goannas and sandy blight were
all part of our daily lives, was covered
with thick, obscuring, noiseless white.
And we were sick of it. Something rich
and native and typical had gone out of
our lives. Even our old gums drooped
as though they were waiting to shrug off
the white heaviness, and to stretch their
tough limbs out once more to the blister-
ing sun.
Yes, we missed the old life, the old
weather ; the north wind droving the
dust, herding the heat; missed our blind-
ing sandstorms even ; missed our blud-
geoning westerly charging our sheds and
houses and, at night, even missed our big
moths diving to death down the lamp-
glass ; missed the drone of the beetles as
they droned about the room or lay
sprawled upon their backs on the table.
We„ were like a pack of dogs that had
been robbed of their fleas.
'’THEN George Coke, one of the
1 Englishmen, came plodding through
the snow; and it was soon apparent that
this Englishman had not lost all his old
English ways, even though he was so
Australian when delivering feats of
abusive oratory; even though he had
become one of us, had grown used to
our flies and heat and spoke the bush-
man’s language.
With his surroundings now shrouded
in white, what could have been more
human than that he should feel the old
spirit of fun come back and let fly at
someone with a handful of snow?
But when you’ve grown up with fel-
low-beings who have also been used to
snowballing, it does not follow that you
can indulge that custom with a person
who has not been brought up in the same
way. For instance, it’s hard, on the in-
stant, to graft a, snowballing complex on
to a person who has never even seen
snow before, knows nothing about snow,
and, more important still, never been hit
in the eye with a handful of snow in all
his born days. Anyway, not unless you
feel on very safe grounds with that per-
son. Of course, you might hit one man
who’d never been hit with a snowball
before and who’d never even seen snow
and get away with it, and such person
might not take it as an offence against
his person and, although not admiring
you for your sense of fun or believing
that there was much good humor in
getting hit with a handful of snow, might
even smile, or pretend to smile, as if
forgiving you because he knew that you
had been brought up throwing handfuls
of snow at people, or else just because
he was a good-natured fellow.
But then again, you might not have
the good fortune to pick such a person
and, on the contrary, pick on a man who
was far from willing to even pretend tb it
there was the least suggestion of fun on
such an action; one who might tafxe
such an act as a direct insult to his per-
son and a matter that would have to be
dealt with summarily.
And so it happened that George Coke
caught Bill Butts, of all men, with as fine
a snowball as ever was thrown; cz ught
him fair in the left eye, and, while Butts
stopped, stood, stared, glared (with the
other eye) and looked generally cumb-
founded, George Coke followed i/p his
first success by letting Butts hijve a
second handful bang in the other eye.
Now these two playful acts were not
received with the same spirit of'good-
fellowship as that which beat in George
Coke’s heart, for, in one split-second,
Butts was tearing into Coke with all the
fury of a man who had been sorely
offended and it was not long before the
blood of the Englishman’s nose stained
our first snow.
The Englishman, surprised, exasperated
and thoroughly roused, tore into Butts,
too, and it was not long before the Aus-
tralian’s left eye began to close up and
then remain closed,
A fight in the snow is a tame affair
and not in it with a hot summer contest.
Breathing did not come hard, rasping
and clean. In a fight under the high, hot
sun you can hear healthy, invigorating
sound ; gasping for breath ; crackling *of
stick and leaf ; and the curses echo. But
a fight in the snow lacked drama. There
was no dust. Grunts were soggy. And
when George and Bill fell down to com-
plete the contest, instead of looking like
men locked in mortal combat, they looked
like two huge white grubs burrowing
into snow.
Their punches travelled the air like
heavy, ponderous, leaden thumps—snow-
bound. Even the blood and the closed
eye did not interest us much.
And yet, for all that, as it turned out,
we were to remember it more than any
other fight that had ever been.
THE Buttses’ place was next to Coke’s
and the two were separated by a
straggling fence that dangled a couple of
loose wires. In front, on the main road,
stood the big gum with the old calico
sign still nailed to it and which had been
nailed up high so that the residents could
not reach up and rip it down when they
felt inclined, and being so high up no-
body had ever been able to read what
was printed on it, save the word “Notice”
in large letters at the top and the words
“By Order” at the bottom. The sign
had been there for 22 years. At the
bottom of the big tree lay the large
limb that had been blown off in the big
blow that had, in playful mood, lifted
Geordie Purbrick up and thrown him
over his own haystack and then thrown
the haystack at him.
On this old limb swaggies sat and
looked dramatically despondent for the
benefit of Mrs. Coke on days when a
tempting wind carried the smell of what
she was roasting in her stove out on to
the road. On a branch of the fallen
limb, that stuck up like a signpost, were
notices of socials and dances dating back
almost to the Kelly days, and alongside
these faded dodgers was a leaflet about
a sale at the ironmonger’s down in the
town which had been burnt down 18
years back and , where the fire-station
now stood. A Welcome Nugget tobacco-
tin lay beside/the log.
At the back was what had once been
a creek but which had forgotten where
it once came from. On the banks of this
relic the grass was a bit greener; but
only on Ma Butts’s part of the creek
and not on Coke’s place at all. Here, on
this promise of greener grass, Coke’s
fowls picked, their calf hung out mostly
instead of in its own paddock and Coke’s
cow, after lifting the wires of the dividing
fence, was also mostly in Butts’s paddock.
Ma Butts had reared nine sons and
they had arrived in this world with that
unbroken regularity sometimes prescribed
by Mother Nature, and, standing the nine
of them in a row, they tapered off from
Bill, the eldest, down to Sam, the young-
est, in a perfectly-graded lirte without one
head being out of line, not one son hav-
ing grown faster or slower than the
others to put the line out by even so
much as the eighth of an inch.
Mr. Butts was not on deck, hadn’t
been on deck for years, and Ma Butts
had never forgotten the day, years back,
when he had come to her and said,
“Florrie, I’m going away,” and plonked
his old portmanteau, which he had packed
on the sly, down beside him. “Leaving
you and the boys for yours and their
sake,” was what he’d said,
“What’s the joke, Jim?” she’d asked.
Then he’d told her how, ever since he’d
been in the riot between the miners and
the Chinks doym on Celestial Flat and
a Chink had hit him over the head with
a pickhandle, he’d had pains in his head
and felt he was now going off his head,
that he was frightened to stay home,
something might happen if he stayed
home and he’d better go away before
the nasty thoughts came back again into
his head ; he didn’t want to do away
with his wife and family, only when the
nasty thoughts and pains came into his
head. Then he left, and his wife was too
upset to say or do anything, just sat and
watched him go and noticed that his
old portmanteau was all broken at the
bottom and the stitching hanging loose,
and found herself wondering if every-
thing would fall out.
Things were then pretty bad for Ma
Butts —nine growing sons to feed. And
when she wasn’t doing something for
them, she’d go and sit down in the same
chair and start staring again. But she
never wept. Not once.
And so she reared and fed them. Butts
had left her with nothing. The plum-
trees were bearing at the time, so she
filled the copper with plums and boiled
them; filled her stove with bread and,
at first, fed them on bread and plums.
Ma Butts, big-bosomed, in her old
brown dress, went shooting rabbits at
dusk, and worked about the district to
buy two cows for milk and butter for
her big, hungry brood. Bill helped her;
“Now, here's something special for the listener who is becoming tired
of lobster mayonnaise."
Bill the eldest; Bill the
second head of the
family. Hard Ma
Butts now; and hard
young Bill Butts, too.
As the years passed
she’d sometimes sit and
look before her as if
she were debating some
question within herself;
as if seeking the answer
as to whether she could
believe Butts or whether
he had put one over her.
And one day she must have reached that
final and long-sought decision, for,
denly she said, with conviction, “The
swine! ”
Then she got up out of the chair and
repeated it, but with an addition. This
time she said, “The cowardly swine!”
and from then on never sat looking into
space again. And there was another
noticeable thing, too. She now slept with
two cartridges on the chair beside her
bed and with her double-barrelled gun
leaning against the chair, and neither the
cartridges nor the gun were there for
the specific purpose of shooting rabbits.
The boys worked it out that the gun was
there just in case their absent father
might, at any time, feel that he was not
going mad after all, didn’t feel like doing
away with his family any more and might
come back home.
OF course, most of us thought that Bill
Butts should have had more sense,
grown up as he was, taking what was
meant as no more than a bit of fun so
seriously, and causing trouble between
himself and George Coke. George had
meant no harm, and we chiacfced Bill for
doing his block. Tommy Dight told him
that Coke only did what he’d been
brought up doing; that over in England
where Tommy’s grandfather came from
people grew up chucking snow at each
other ; and Dave Steen, who was a friend
of Coke’s, told Bill that it was second
nature for a man to do what he’d been
brought up doing.
“Yes, Bill,” he said. “If you’d come
from the Old Dart yourself you’d have
been the first to start chucking 1 snow. It
all depends. A man only does what he’s
been used to ; does exactly what he’s been
brought up to and sometimes it doesn’t fit
in with other blokes and what they’ve
been brought up to, and that’s all there
is to it.”
And now our old climate seemed to be
coming back again, the white hoods and
mantles were disappearing, and the whole
wide sweep of snow beginning to weep off
and melt back into the warming earth;
the rocks and boulders began to mush-
room up. through the thinning whiteness.
With this, Bill Butts had started clean-
ing up their cowyard, shovelling the pats
and cakes of cowdung into a wheelbarrow
and carting the loads into their front pad-
dock to manure a plot of ground. He
had carted several loads to the front,
and, at the end of one trip, was about
to return to the cowyard for another load
when he heard Coke’s front door bang,
and, turning round, saw George Coke
walking up his own front paddock.
Now, it’s funny sometimes how things
will happen, and it’s hard sometimes to
work out just how and why a thing does
happen. But, anyway, when Bill Butts
saw George Coke turn out of his pad-
dock and then turn to come along the
road and pass his own place, a sudden,
wry smile moved his mouth.
So here again we come to the other pic-
ture, for, taking Butts as a human being
also, just as Coke had been a human
being, what could have been more human
than that Butts, with cakes and slabs of
cowdung all spread out about him, should
go back to those early days of his when
he, as a boy, had grown up throwing
lumps of cowdung at people?
As Coke drew level, Butts divided a
large slab of cowdung and let fly with it
and caught Coke also fair in the eye, and
while Coke also stood, stared, glared,
gasped and also looked dumbfounded,
caught him with a second lump.
Maybe Butts felt more than just an
innocent boyish urge when he threw the
cowdung, but, as to that, who can say?
Suffice it to mention that he certainly got
a little more than his own back in the
process, innocent motive or not. In this
case, though, Coke did not tear into
Butts but turned on his heel and walked
back again into his house, and Butts
walked back into his place, too, and told
Ma about it.
“Son,” said Ma, “you got morehi your
own back, anyway.”
Later that day Butts said to Dave Steen
that he’d had a bit of fun with George
Coke and that had George Coke been
born in the district Coke would have
been the first to chuck the cowdung.
“It all depends,” said Butts. “A man
does what he’s been used to; does

COENEB OF KING AND PITT
STREETS. ’PHONE 8W27 2 1, OB WRITE


exactly what he’s been brought up to,
and that’s all there is to it.”
THREE days later Trooper Newbigun,
who always looked a perfect picture
on his white Arab mount and raised the
tone of the town by his magnificent
appearance, and who was used mostly for
gracing the showgrounds arena’ on show
days, the Court House Hotel paddock on
Saturday afternoons during the football
season, and for riding most graciously
and patriotically up the main street of
the town annually on the King’s Birth-
day, now had a most pleasant duty to
perform. He brushed the dust off his
leggings, gave his saddle a rub, placed the
carefully-folded blue paper most im-
maculately in the little black satchel that
hung strapped to his saddle, and, riding
majestically into our district as if it had
been the King’s Birthday and whistling
all the sweet and balmy airs he knew,
handed spectacularly, ostentatiously and
publicly to Bill Butts —while Will Sparrow
and his wife were driving past and Sunny
Cooper was leaning over Coke’s fence
and talking to Coke —the carefully-folded
blue paper, which he had also taken most
carefully and delicately out of its satchel.
Then, bringing out a little black book,
he entered in it the correct time and date
of service of the summons:, George
Ernest Basil Cromwell Coke v. Wil-
liam Butts. This done, he leaned over
picturesquely and patted affectionately
the sleek neck of his aristocratic mount,
again flicked the dust off his leggings,
and, riding with perfect ease, grace and
beauty, set off back to town.
Bill Butts rolled the summons up,
closed his hand over it, put the hand deep
down in his pocket, turned, and walked
back to the house ; and —Sunny Cooper
leaving suddenly—Coke then walked up
his paddock and back to his house, both
men walking slowly and almost in a dead
line with each other. Then Coke’s door
slammed and Butts’s heavy boots scraped
on the boards at their place.
“Coke’s summonsed me for assault!”
said Butts.
Ma put down the potato she was peel-
ing and looked down into her back pad-
dock where two white Leghorns belong-
ing to Mrs. Coke were picking at the
greener grass down by the bank of the old
creek. She stood up, and her big bosom
rose and fell.
“Oh, going to law, are they?” Her
bosom rose and fell with a greater swell.
“We don’t go to law about here; we
settle things among ourselves in our own
way.”
She went into her room and picked up
two cartridges that had been waiting so
long for Mr. Butts, slipped them into her
gun, and said that if the Cokes were
going to do things that way—well, she’d
do things her way, too, she wasn’t going
to provide feed for their fowls any longer.
She walked down the paddock, slpng the
gun up, and two loud shots rattled the air.
Ma Butts then, with the smoke still
curling out the barrels, stalked defiantly
in to the Cokts’ place and, with the
same spirit with which she had kept the
two cartridges waiting for Mr. Butts,
warned the Cokes that she’d shot two of
their fowls wandering on her property and
that if she saw their calf or their cow
on her place again she’d put a charge
of shot into them, too.
“It’s the Cowdungs against the Snows
now,” she said.
, News of these events spread like the
smell of fire.
OUR human ants’-nest now began to
swarm. Remember, we’d never taken
one another to court, never summonsed
any one of the clan, never gone to law to
settle our tribal differences or disputes.
Naturally enough, we all had different
ideas as to whether George Coke should
have thrown the snow at Bill Butts,
whether Butts should have attacked him
and whether Butts should have thrown
the cowdung and whether Coke should
have taken him to court for assault or
not, and it was not long after the sum-
mons had been served on Butts before
Ma Butts’s words looked like becoming
a reality—the Cowdungs against the
Snows, the Snows against the Cowdungs.
We all discussed and argued the coming
case. Bush lawyers sprang up and won
and lost the case over and over again;
self-appointed magistrates tried the case
and gave verdicts for both parties.
We discussed Peake, the chief magis-
trate, too, before whom the case was to
be heard. Peake had once, somewhere
way down south and before he became
chief magistrate in his present place, sen-
tenced a man to six months’ imprisonment
for discharging firearms on the Sabbath,
but the man had appealed against the
sentence and had the sentence reduced
to a fine.
Peake lived in the big white house just
north of the town. He was a classy man
and used to drive about in a clinking dog-
cart with, as everybody said, his “monkey-
faced” groom sitting up beside his master
like a “monkey with gloves on.” Peake
never pulled aside for anybody on the
roads, everybody made way for him,
George Coke had Fyfe the solicitor
appearing for him. Eyfe was a bit on the
smart side. According to Dick Sloat,
Fyfe had once inserted a notice in a
paper to the effect that if a man called
Simpson, who had once lived at Echo
Hill, called on him he’d hear of some-
thing to his advantage, and when Simp-
son. after travelling two hundred and
“Hold it! Hold it!”
fifty miles, called on him, handed him a
summons for debt, and Fyfe had to shut
himself up in hisi office for safety.
Sloat told Butts that unless he got
someone to defend him Fyfe would cut
him to ribons in the box, and Butts went
and saw Mr. Wegan, the town’s real
lawyer, Mr. Wegan drank loyally at the
Court House Hotel and was a good
lawyer when he was sober, so they said.
They also said that he “would have been
a Judge in the city but for his love for
the bottle.”
HT HE building that housed the court-
i house and lock-up was no architect’s
dream, but the great dignity of the police
made up for what was lacking in paint
and plaster. The town could not claim
the dignity of possessing its own jail, and
offenders had to put up with the incon-
venience of being sent to the jail down
south. Also, the lockup lacked such
conveniences as strong, heavy cells with
floors of brick or plaster to lodge
prisoners in before trial and after trial
and while awaiting conveyance to their
new address down south.
Still, for all that, the police had man-
aged to get along all right in the past;
the cell they had was strong enough to
hold any prisoner they’d ever had.
This cell was a small wooden affair and
resembled one of those small, light, mov-
able buildings contractors move about
and use as an office on the job. It was
of weatherboard, had a wooden floor, and
was not hampered with such things as a
foundation; nor was 'it attached to the
earth in any way. It stood out in the
yard in alTits simple privacy, and, viewed
from the distance, almost looked like one
of those stark little buildings so familiar
in country districts; hut, in strict fact
and viewed closely, it was rather too large
for such an edifice.
IT might have been Show Day, almost,
t the day the case caime on, and Haw-
kins, of t}ie “Banner,” promised himself
that if be could make a good story of it
he, as editor, would take the stud notice
and the. pound notice off the leader page
and make a splash of the case. In view
of the general excitement it seemed likely
that the police might be able to manage
a couple of arrests, and Constable Wyn-
der, who hadn’t had a case for months,
hoped for at least one case of resisting
during which “violent brawl” his uniform
would be just a little damaged “while in
the execution of his duty.”
Ma Butts and her sons, married and
single, sat at the back of the court, and
George Coke and his wife sat well away
from them ; and they sat there for hours,
too, for there was a long argument
during the preceding case, which was,
unfortunately, a very dull one concern-
ing land.
Peake had never had such a full house
before and looked picturesquely stern,
Fyfe was ready and ambitious for the
fray, and Mr. Wegan, the capable lawyer,
was at home in bed with a bottle of
whisky and a jug of water at his bedside,
having sent a message to the Court that
owing to disability he was prevented from
appearing in court; the true facts being
that on coming out of the Court House
Hotel /on the previous day Mr. Wegan
had collided with the horse-trough, cut his
right eye on the gravel beneath him, and
also caused a scar to appear on his left
temple.
The case came on after lunch, and Fyfe
put his dent in the box; and then Mrs.
Coke went into the box, and, after having
given her evidence, told the magistrate, in
a burst of confidence, that Mrs. Butts had
shot her fowls and then threatened to
shoot her.
From the back of the court Ma in-
formed Mrs. Coke that she was a liar,
and Constable Wynder moved dramati-
cally towards Ma, while Sergeant Sellers
looked hopefully around for a disturbance
in court with the hope that he would
have to eject someone as Peake, with
Constable Wynder standing all ready in
case like, informed Ma Butts succulently
that, if she did not behave herself, he
would have her placed in “the cells.”
William Butts went into the box then,
and Bill Butts heard how he had mali-
ciously, wantonly and with cow-ardly
malice thrown cow-dung in Fyfe’s client’s
face.
Here the magistrate enjoyed, with Fyfe,
this superb example of legal wit, and
Sunny Cooper looked as if he was just
about to enjoy the humor, too, when Ser-
geant Seilers gave him a prod in the back
and commanded him to sit up straight
(which he was doing) and behave himself
in court.
Then Constable Wynder hopefully
swept the whole court eagerly with search-
ing eyes for signs of laughter, or even a
smile, but had no luck.
Bill Butts told the Court that he had
done no more than Coke had done when
Coke had thrown the* snow. He said it
was what a man has been brought up to.
Coke had been brought up throwing
snow and he had been brought up throw-
ing cowdung, and that was all there
was to it. Then Troopers Newbigun and
Dennis (the latter known around the dis-
trict as “Thunderbolt”) came in and
stood omnipotently and ominously at the
back of the court.
Fyfe then addressed the Court and re-
ferred to William Butts as an “oaf.”
He then mentioned his client having to
fight Butts in self-defence in the first
case and then made great play with
“filthy dung”—“pure white driven snow”
—“fine old English custom” and the like.
Then: “I ask you, your Worship, is a
handful of obscene and smellful, filthy
cowdung to be compared with a handful
of clean, pure, God-given snow when
thrown in a man’s face?”
After this everybody in court looked
at the chief magistrate in the same way
as they used to look to see if the snake
was coming out from behind the hessian.
Peake pointed his pen at Bill Butts’s
chest, and, as a light wind springs up
across the treetops, and then dies, so a
light murmur ran through the court and,
like the passing wind, died away again.
“An offence of a most odious nature! ”
He now sighted the pen at Bill Butts’s
head. “Threw a handful of filth in the
face of a new settler in this country!”
He took aim at Bill’s stomach. “A fine
would be inadequate punishment!” Next
he seemed to be aiming at Bill’s heart.
“My duty!” The pen was very steady.
Bang! “ be sentenced to seven days’
imprisonment! ”
In the stillness there came a low, short,
soft, staccato-like whistle and all eyes
searched each other’s faces wondering
where it had come from; but there was
no movement, only silence. Bill Butts
was thinking of that whistle, though, as
they led him out to his little wooden cell.
And now the people were outside the
court again, everybody climbing up into
their different turnouts, quiet and orderly.
“Now then, get moving,” said Sergeant
Sellers truculently and hopefully to no
one in particular.
Not a soul said an angry word.
Constable Wynder then walked up to
Sergeant Sellers, and stood as if assuring
the sergeant that he could count on him it
the trouble got any worse ; and by the
time Troopers Newbigun and Thunder-
bolt had mounted and were riding re-
assuringly past, and then back again, to
stabilise the town, everybody had gone
home.
Later, the lockup-keeper saw to it that
Bill had something to eat and received his
two heavy, grey-blue blankets. “You re
bedded down for the night now. Butts,
he said, “and you won’t be disturbed until
five-ten in the morning for breakfast be-
fore going down south to spend your
week’s holiday as the King’s guest.
A PROCESSION marches in the
night; a stealthy procession of thir-
teen men walking softly in the shadows
of the moon. The magistrate’s horse in
his paddock, north of the town, stands
up against the fleeing moon in half-
silhouette, his ears stuck up straight, in-
quiringly. Does Dombey sense that there
is a connecting link between this strange
sight and his master? Dombey, the
chief magistrate’s fine, fat, patted and
petted horse. Never more than the
merest touch of the whip ; the lightest
flick. “Dombey, I wouldn’t punish you
with a whip. No, but I’d order a
whipping for some of the loafers who live
near me.”
As if sensing that things are not in
order somehow, Dombey snorts.
Weekley’s cow now stands and stares,
then turns tail and rocks off, her udder
swaying from side to side, one moment
the teats in shadow, the next moment
swaying back into the light and shining
silvery in the light of the moon.
There is not much to be seen of the
men passing over the paddocks; just the
soft press of their feet. Little, sudden
flicks of white flip up and disappear into
burrows. Then, as the strange and weird
procession passes softly between the old
grey stumps and spectre-like trees there
comes a whispering, a soft, low chanting,
first one set of voices, and then other
voices following as the first voices
quieten. And what is the silhouette that
blocks the moon —the thing they carry?
A joss-house? A shrine? Is some sacred
rite being practised?
But it is not a joss, but the town’s
modest wooden cell, set up on two stout
poles and securely bound with rope, and
as they carry it they sing—very softly;
Oh, the Sergeant, how he swore!
For the Sergeant, he was sore;
For he couldn’t find his Bill Butts
in the morning!
The lockup cell was gone.
Which once he looked upon;
Oh, gone along with Bill Butts
in the morning!
When they reached a safe distance
from the town, far from houses, and
where the sounds of a hammer and chisel
could not possibly be heard they halted,
gently let down the poles supporting the
little wooden building which was the
property of the King and, in no time, had
the lock off, the bolt off and the door
open. This done, Charlie Butts, organiser
and commander of the relief squad, gave
orders:—
“Take the ropes and the crowbar and
get, and don’t be seen ; and hide the poles
in the scrub. Tell everyone, if they say
a word or make a slip, we’ll all be
arrested and get jail. Get home and into
bed at once, in case.”
The relief squad (mostly Buttses, and
married) set off, all except Sam Butts,
still single and living at home with Bill
and Ma.
“Everything’s fixed, Bill,” said Charlie.
“Here! Ma’s got all your tucker ready.
Make for the old mine and stay there
till you see me —or Sam. Get!”
“I gave the rescue signal in the court,
Bill,” said Sam. “So you’d know and
wouldn’t make a noise when we were
getting the cell up on to the poles.”
“Get home to bed, Sam,” said Charlie.
“I’m off to mine—been there since ten
o’clock, as Else will swear on a dozen
Bibles.”
Bill slung the two bran bags of tucker
over his shoulder and disappeared into
the darkness of the scrub.
When Sam sneaked in home, Ma
Butts stood beside him in the dark room
and Sam could see the grey light from the
window lighting up weirdly the whites of
her eyes. She whispered as if the dark-
ness around her might be against them.
“Has my Bill got away?”
“Yes, he’s gone to the old mine,” Sam
whispered back.
While the lockup-keeper slept a cock
crowed in the quietness, a dog barked,
the vixen screamed from the rise and,
while his rescuers were all safely in bed,
Bill Butts padded silently through the
great, wide, dark friendliness of the night.
So our insurgency began, preceded, as
are all the best insurrections, by an
apparent calm. The orderliness and

w


quietness after the court case, which had
been so disappointing to the police, was
merely a preparation for this ; a plain
omen, if any had had the wit to read it.
And the whistle which had sounded in
court had been the rescue signal used
by the Butfs boys when, with their mates,
they used to play bushrangers; and one
of that gang, a man now, was really flee-
ing from justice for doing what they had
often played when they were boys—a
game of cowdung.
A warrant was issued next day for
Butts’s arrest and Troopers Newbigun
and Thunderbolt were dispatched to our
district to investigate, stare out of coun-
tenance, trip, catch, be suspicious or not
suspicious ; and we, the residents, all told
the exact hour at which we hadn’t gqne
to bed but said we had, what we did or
were doing between the certain hours,
and vowed before our Maker that we
did not know that Bill Butts had escaped,
knew nothing whatsoever about a cell
being stolen —anyway, those of us who
were on the side of the Cowdungs. What
those on the other side said we did not
know, but we could guess that they were
surprised.
The Snows and the Cowdungs! Sus-
picion was rife now, tongues guarded,
eyes slanted.
WE couldn’t agree which trooper
looked best in the saddle when seen
riding together, but all agreed that
Thunderbolt was the kindlier of the two.
They were riding along lazily on their
round of interrogatories concerning the
escaped prisoner and, at the same time,
seeking the whereabouts of an escaped
cell, when Newbigun said that he would
arrest all the Buttses on suspicion, if he
had his way, and as for Bill Butts, the
magistrate could have given him three
weeks and the sentence would then have
been light.
In reply to this, Thunderbolt said that,
as for arresting i all the Buttses—well, that
would be plain foolishness ; and giving
Bill Butts a sentence of three weeks for
throwing a lump of cowdung at a man
wouldn’t be right.
“Oh!” said Newbigun.
“In fact,” said Thunderbolt. “He
shouldn’t have been given a term of
imprisonment at all. A fine would have
sufficed. A mountain has been made out
of a molehill.”
“I don’t agree,” said Newbigun. “If
I’d been on the bench I’d have given him
ftis just deserts —three months wouldn’t
nave been excessive.”
“You’re talking rot,” said Thunderbolt,
“Rot!” said Newbigun, coloring up.
“Yes,” said Thunderbolt. “Damned
rot! ”
Newbigun then said that perhaps
Thunderbolt was on the side of the Cow-
dungs, as they called, themselves, but
Thunderbolt made no reply. So that
evening they rode back to town not
abreast, artistically and picturesquely, but
with Thunderbolt ahead, and with a suffi-
cient distance between them to suggest
that they were not in the mood to admire
earth’s soft and russet gown or even
discuss the results of the day’s hunt,
'T' HE escaped cell having been located,
I Constable Wynder with two men and
tackle set off in a lorry and brought the
cell back to town with as much dignity
as one lone constable could establish.
The incident of the stolen cell had
.given our little community up north of
the town the greatest joy and pleasure,
and many remarks were made along the
road as the caravan was passing, and, of
course, when it was passing the Court
House Hotel in the town it was only
natural that such a unique and historical
scene should receive homage from the
populace there,. too, and that Barnie
Guest and Tom Kerrigan should leave
the bar and, advancing most deferentially,
and with perfect rhythm, out into the
middle of the road as the cell was passing,
bend down low in abject respect and with
*the most humble and graceful of bows
sweep their hats off to the very ground
and remain in such deferential attitude
as if they were paying homage to the
.King himself.
It was Constable Wynder’s big chance,
and, leaping off the lorry, he apprehended
the two gallant gentlemen, added them
’ to the procession and later laid a charge
of “offensive behavior in a public place”
against them, and both of them had to
keep an appointment with the chief
magistrate at ten o’clock, sharp, in the
morning.
Next morning Peake fined them ten
shillings, and, when the business of the
Court was over, got up into his shiny,
clinking dog-cart and set off home.
He had hardly turned into the main
North Road when who should be coming
! down it but Joe Crundall and driving his
team of eight big draughts—Joe Crundall,
great friend of Charlie Butts’s.
When Joe saw the*magistrate coming
, spanking down the road towards him in
his dinky turnout with Monkey Face sit-
ting up beside him showing his gloves
off, Joe thought of what had happened to
Charlie’s brother Bill. As Peake was
drawing near Joe swung his whip up with
a great show of being busy, and at the
same time shouted wildly at his leaders
and swung them, just as Peake was ready
to pass, not to one side but right across
Peake’s path and then, with more fuss
and purposeful fury, turned the team
right across the road in front of Peake
and forced him to leave the road. Peake
was almost jammed against the fence and
Joe, with great shouts, plunged his team
furiously past, the side of his wagon
rasping and grating along and over the
clean, shining, polished side of Peake’s
immaculate dog-cart,
Peake was furious, but by the time
he’d got clear, Joe was churning the
road up with his team and loudly up-
braiding his leaders and, at the same
time, increasing the distance between him-
self and Peake. Joe then told himself
with a smirk that accidents will happen
and that if anything came of it he’d put
all the blame on to his two new leaders,
“Do you know, Mary,” said Peake to
his wife when he got home, “I’ll swear
that a man driving a big team of horses
along the North Road tried to jam me
into the fence when I was driving past
oh my way home! ”
“Well, Henry, you’re not over-popular
in this district, are you?” she said.
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Peake.
“Oh, well, I do,” said his wife, “I’ve
heard people say it, and I can understand
it in a way.”
Peake looked at her,
' “I was reading the ‘Banner’ this morn-
ing,” she went on, “and I read about that
"Just in time to boil the billy. Got a match on you, Princess ?”
case of the man who threw cowdung, and I
do not think you should have sentenced him
to imprisonment for such a paltry act.”
Peake frowned.
Mrs. Peake smiled.
“You know, Henry, I’ve always thought
that you’re a little inclined to imprison
a man in preference to a fine.” She
sighed. “I hope, in a way, the man is
never captured.”
Mr. Peake’s frown deepened.
“As a matter of fact,” said Mrs. Peake,
drifting on airily, “I had a real set-to
this morning with Mrs, Nagle. And we’ve
always been such friends, too.” She
shrugged her shoulders, “She was so
much on the side of that man Coke that
I simply had to speak up for Butts and,
one thing leading to another, she huffed
off. Called me cowdung! I told her not
to call again.”
“Nagle, her husband, is my personal
friend,” said Peake. “I think you have
been most foolish.”
That night Monkey Face, up in his
room, over the stable, heard the sound
of voices raised in argument. He sneaked
down and listened. “Well, let me tell
you,” he heard Peake say, “you will
kindly refrain from mentioning what I do
as a magistrate. I don’t want to hear
what you think, and I don’t give a damn
whether you approve of what I do as a
magistrate or whether you do not approve
of what Ido as chief magistrate. It’s
none of your business, and I’ll have no
more of it.”
GEORGE COKE, unable to keep his
fowls cooped up any longer in the
old corrugated-iron tank with the tap
off and the wire-netting stretched over
it, which was lying on its side, thereby
causing the fowls to keep slipping, was
now busy building a pen to keep them in
and away from Ma Butts’s gun.
Coke’s calf was tethered, too, as was
his dog. The dog had been tied up ever
since Coke saw the “poison-laid” notice
sticking up in Ma Butts’s paddock and
facing the Cokes’ home.
As Ma Butts had said to Sam when
he was printing the notice, “Of course
we won’t lay poison, Coke’s dog is a
good dog and it’s a pity the Cokes are
not as good as their dog. It’s just to be
not friendly.”
So Coke’s dog, which had never been
on a chain before, now strained at its
chain all day long and barked, and at
night barked and howled, to the discom-
fort of Mrs, Pell, a close neighbor. Mrs.
Pell sent her sister-in-law, Stella, over to
tell Mrs. Coke that her dog was keeping
her awake all night with its howling, and
Mrs. Coke told Stella that sjie’d better
go and make her complaint to Ma Butts,
who had laid poison and compelled her to
keep her dog chained up, poor creature,
Stella then felt sympathetic towards
Mrs. Coke, and said that her brother’s
wife was only trying to make trouble, to
take no notice of her, she snored all
night, anyway, just like a pig. She then
said that she’d better go and tell Ma
Butts that she was keeping her sister-in-
law awake every night, anyway, so she
could tell her that she’d
complained for her.
Stella then crossed over and, knocking
Ma, up, told her that she’d better stop
laying poison for everybody’s dogs, her
sister-in-law Mrs. Pell couldn’t sleep with
the barking of all the dogs on their
chains. Ma said nothing, but Stella must
have seen something in Ma’s eyes because
she left very hastily and, looking back
from the roadway, saw, out of the corner
of her eye, Ma standing picturesquely
and dramatically on her verandah with
her double-barrelled gun reclining easily
across her big strong arms.
After this incident Mrs. Coke, who saw
it all from her window, told everybody
that Ma Butts tried to shoot Stella Pell
and Stella Pell also told people that Ma
Butts had tried to murder her; as she
was running away, Stella said she thought
she heard a shot ring out, or it might have
been two.
By this time, quite a number of people
were enjoying helping to trick the police ;
not that the police appeared to be very
upset. But there was a lot of bitter feel-
ing in the district, which flared up at the
council meeting, when Councillor Mul-
lingsbury called out “Cowdung!” to
Councillor Wetherington, whereupon
Councillor Wetherington jumped up on
to the council-chamber table and re-
taliated with “Snow'! Snow! Snow!”
There were, of course, misunderstand-
ings. Albert Horne, one of our three
Englishmen, was talking about the case
one day .to Trooper Newbigun and re-
marked, “Oh, well, as Mr. Weller said,
‘The law’s a hass’.”
Trooper Newbigun sat up very stiff and
rigid and said, in a most officious manner,
that he didn’t know who Mr. Weller was,
but, if Mr. Weller wasn’t careful, Mr.
Weller would see himself, one day, within
the four walls of a jail if he didn’t keep a
check on his tongue.
Then Albert Horne laughed that real
English laugh of his and said that Mr.
Weller was on© of Charles Dickens’s
famous characters. Trooper Newbigun
turned his horse’s head and rode off with
such dignity that Albert Horne said, just
like an Australian, “Gawd starve the
crows! ”
Of course Trooper Newbigun poked
about the district for clues as to where
Bill Butts had gone, but he did not poke
far enough into the rough country to
disturb the shine on his leggings or where
the undergrowth was thick enough to rip
the threads of his fine and shapely-
looking breeches.
It was Trooper Dennis—Thunderbolt—
who rode farther afield and he, while
on the trail, sang odd snatches of his
favorite old Irish song, and appeared to
be enjoying himself.
Bill Butts, with his two Government
blankets, remained hidden among the
boulders and grey gauntness of the old
mine and waited for things to blow over
a bit. Young Sam Butts kept him sup-
plied with tucker.
Meanwhile, the district was at sixes and
sevens with itself, people driving past
each other on the roads as if they’d never
known each other before. Wives, especi-
ally, were fighting furiously, some of the
Butts’s wives even being cold and on non-
speaking terms to each 'other. This was a
secondary reaction, a kind of scheme.
Then Grandma Cashen’s birthday came
round again. Grandma Cashen, the oldest
woman living within a compass of
hundreds of miles and who had seen
more trouble—and more goodness, so
she said —than any of us. We were
accustomed to going over on her birth-
days to shake the old lady’s frail little
hand and wish her a happy birthda!y ;
and she would tell us all over again about
her early memories, which we always pre-
tended to believe all over again although
we all knew that her father did not land
with Captain Cook, and that she had
never lived “with a wild tribe of blacks
in the wild bush” who used to shake their
spears at her.
So this year we called on her as usual
to say our piece and receive the~ advice
she generally gave us concerning our
shortcomings and habits.
But this time she was in high dudgeon
with us all, “the mean way” we were all
going on, and said that none of us had
any “tack” ; if we’d shown more “tack”
there wouldn’t have been so much
trouble. Grandma Cashen, looking at us
all with her old, clear, keen, Irish blue
eyes, was right, too.
THEN it happened—that which was to
unite us all again.
One day, while George Coke’s boy and
Horne’s boy were having a friendly
game chucking cowdung at each other in
Ma Butts’s front paddock, Ma came out
of her door and asked young Coke to take
down the notice for her.
“I’ve got no men about the place to
do things for me now,” she said,
“Take the poison notice down?” said
young Coke.
“Yes,” said Ma. “I was going to get
my Sam to do it, but now he’s gone and
enlisted, too. Gone to fight for the King.
That mfckes five of my sons gone to
fight.”
“The Germans,” said young Coke.
The Mechanics’ Institute in the town
had been turned into a recruiting centre,
and the men who came into the town all
went in the one door. Every now and
then, when the numbers grew, they’d
leave by train for the big camp in the
city, and as they marched down the main
street to the little station the townspeople
stood simply by; some smiling and fol-
lowing, some standing still with a lump
in their throat and some laughing and
cheering. Monkey Face was one of the
first. Coke had gone, too ; so had Horne,
Dick Sloat, Tommy Dight and the others
—they were all in it.
Along the roads people were now re-
membering that they knew each other,
and Mrs. Peake used to sometimes sit
beside Mr. Peake in his dog-cart—and
once she was heard call him “Snow”
jokingly and he had laughed in public,
a very rare thing for him.
Ma Butts bought a new box of cart-
ridges— to shoot the Germans if they
came, she said. But everybody wondered
if Ma hadn’t bought it for someone who
was not a German and who might be
looking for a comfortable home while
the war lasted.
BILL BUTTS sneaked down home and
Ma hardly knew him with a beard,
so she said. She put some things together
for him in an old suitcase and then
walked a bit of the way with him through
the dark, still paddocks. Bill was going
to enlist in the city.
After about a mile she stopped.
“I won’t go any further, son. It
wouldn’t do for me to be seen with you.
I’ll say good-bye here.”
She then told him to get his ticket, and
get straight into the train when he got to
the station in case the police were about.
Then she said good-bye to her first-
born and, when she returned home, sat
down and cried.
At the station Bill Butts pulled his hat
down and bought his ticket. The little
station was jammed with people seeing
their sons, brothers and fathers off, and,
unnoticed and unrecognised, he went and
stood near the end of the platform beside
the cases and the milkcans just as
Thunderbolt arrived. Thunderbolt, strid-
ing along with a swagger and looking as
fine and handsome as the great Thunder-
bolt himself.
Then Thunderbolt recognised Bill.
“Hullo, trooper,” said Bill slowly,
“Gome about the warrant?”
Thunderbolt looked magnificent.
“I’ve come about no warrant,” he
said. “I could have arrested you any
time, hiding up there by the old mine.”
He laughed magnificently,
“Go on!” said Bill, wonderingly.
“Yes,” said Thunderbolt, nodding sig-
nificantly. “I knew you were there all
the time.”
“Why didn’t you arrest me then?” Bill
asked. Then, as he stood there waiting
for Thunderbolt to reply, a look came
into his eyes as if he suddenly knew, and
a broad grin slid over his face, which was
most unusual for him.
“Cowdung?” said Bill.
“Aye, cowdung,” said Thunderbolt.

Marsden.
Evil is half of us, as the doorway
of stone is half closed upon us here
in this house dedicated unto God.
And half of it open to the air,
and the gulls, and the muddy river;
and the vessel waiting for the tide.
The sailor spits on his raw red hands,
grips the wood of the sculls;
hums a tune that fits his mood,
and dedicates the words to the devil.
A space of time ticks its measure
on the ship’s clock, between tide and tide.
And the Captain, judging the moment
to the second, fires the. signal gun
that strikes the church with a brutal fist
and rattles the golden furniture inside,
smacks the windows twice and skips away.
And, “Friends, I cannot preach to you
today.”

Glaucus.
The days have been blind with rain
And driven spray.
The nights black with the fury of rock
and surge,
But the sun shines today
On great white-silver clouds in blue deeps
sailing
And, darker blue and brighter white, in
thunder %
The glittering seas sweep in, still moun-
tains high.
To the beach where the wet brown weed
lies heaped and scattered
And a child plays, lonely under
That vast and moving sky.
The seabird’s fallen feather.
The rose-frail shell,
The twisted shark-egg, whence the shadow
of death
Has slipped— too rich to tell,
The spoil she gathers, dropped in the
storm’s retreat—
But all these she lets go now, for one
prize.
Tiny and queer, washed up limp on the
sands,
Half-dead —but wait, see the sudden
wonder flowering
Mirrored deep in her still eyes
From her cupped, sea-filled hands.
How feathery delicate
Those wings unfurled.
Silver-white to darkest blue through the
clear water —
A being not of this world
But some lost fairy-angel, and the tremor
Of that strange life touching her flesh is
more
Than heart can bear alone, and she has
fled
Over the sandhills home, but before the
red roof
Breaks the treetops, long before,
The beauty will be dead.
I was that child, who now
Am child no more.
Not the white nor the sooty feather can
heal my heart,
No flotsam of the shore
Is treasure now —but still, great gales gone
over,
To that long coast my stumbling feet yet
tread
Comes the strange guest, with the wild
morning foam —
Oh, in the storm-beat breast the wings
unfolding !
Sea-hued, heaven-hued, that is dead
Before I bring it home.

Of Love and Time.
“Run faster, love,” you say and I
Grow, dizzy asking why and why.
“Run faster, love, the rival night
Runs down our avenue of light;
Run faster, love, my Image shines
Upon the stations of the signs.”
Sharpen the blade I must, and tear
This Moon away, these Stars, this hair
Whose weeping gold blinds me until
The dazzle in my eyes is still.
“Run faster, love !” But who could cut
A pathway where her eyelids shut
Her dreaming in a sphere of blue
I dare not let my thought walk through ?

Country Dance.
The dance in the township hall is nearly
over.
Hours ago the stiff-handed woodcheeked
women
got up from the benches round the walls
and look home their sighing blood and
, weary children.
Mrs. McLarty with twenty cows to milk
before dawn, went with the music sting-
ing
like sixty wasps under her best frock.
Eva Callaghan whose boy died in the
army
sat under the paper streamers like a house
to let
and went alone, a black pot brimming
with tears.
“My body was a white cedar, my breasts
the buds on the quince-tree
that now are fallen and grey like logs on
a bare hill:
Then why is my blood not quiet? what
is the good
of the music stinging like whips along
my blood ?’’
The dance in the township hall is nearly
over.
The fire out in the yard like a great red
city
eats back into the log, its noisy flames.
fallen. ' .
Tommy Dunn has forgotten his camp in
the hills
and sleeps like a heap of rags beside a
bottle.
The boys staring into the far red city
think of the neons at night and the girls
at the corners
with lips like coals and thighs as silver as
florins.
Jock Harrison thinks of the baldy cow
gone sick
and the cockatoos in the corn and the
com ready to pick
and the wires of the thirty-acre broken.
Oh, what rats nibble at the cords of our
nerves ?
When will the wires part, the ploughed
paddocks fall open,
the bow of the fiddle saw through the
breastbone,
the dream be done, and we waken ?
The dance grows faster, the pink
streamers are falling,
falling the gumleaf boughs and paper
stars.
Only the lovers and the young are danc-
ing
now at the end of the dance, in a trance
or singing.
Sing the lovers locked together and
crowned with colored paper
“The piece of black glass I picked up out
of the campfire,
that is the glitter that the light sets on
your hair.”
“The green pool I swam in under the
willows
is the drowning depth, the summer night
of your eyes.”
“You are the death I move to.” “Oh
burning wearing
you are the. pain I long for.”
Stars, leaves and streamers fall in the
dark dust
and the blind man lies alone in his sphere
of night.
“Oh, I,
red centre of a dark and burning sky,
fit my words to music, my crippled words
to music,
and sing to the fire with the voice of the
fire.
Go sleep with your fear; go sleep with
your desire;
go deep into the core of night and
silence;
but I hold all of you, your loss and
sorrow,
your longing and your fear; I am the
breath
that holds you from your death;
I am the voice of music and the ended
dance."

[At the Chateau .]
What lutes, what notes, what waterfalls
of music.
Voices of summer dying on the wind;
From the carved balustrades, the formal
gardens
The murmuring laughter eddies to its
end.
Over the paving-stones the lingering
crimson,
Linden and gold, a burden of brocade;
In the stitched meadows of a thousand
flowers,
Pensive as listeners to a silent music
They dream, enchanted, in the close-
leaved shade.
Oh idle hands beneath the falling
fountain.
Gloved fingers resting on the marble
urn;
Hands that withdraw, that speak, that
lie together
Folded like wings upon a shaft of stone.
Distant as figures dancing in a landscape
This fabled grace gives back its youth to
Age,
Prisoned and held upon a web of canvas
Or shut forever in a Book of Hours
Between the enamelled • and the gilded
page.

The Prophet.
The starveling prophet, haggard and
unkempt.
Beyond the power of devil or maid to
tempt,
His knees all raw with kneeling on the
stones,
His wasted flesh scarce covering his old
bones,
Standing alone, on scorched and bleeding
feet.
Delivers his shrill message to the street.
Where, a grotesque offence to nose and
eye.
He rants, unheeded of the passers-by,
His largesse offering, hearkened to by
none.
Deep wisdom from his fasts and vigils
won. '
A purblind people with but trivial aims,
Money-bags, hazards, picture-shows and
games.
Besotted with their luxury and lust.
They sport upon the all-too-fragile crust
That, like the film upon a lava-flow,
Masks the pulsating fires he sees below;
How should they listen to his cries and
groans
Or look for guidance to a bag of bones ?

ARNOLD WALL.
The Goldfish Pool.
The devil in the shape of a water-scorpion
swam
Across the pool at sunset. Oh, beetle and
gnat
And fry of the golden fishes will meet
their doom
In those lean jerking arms, that horny
throat,
And yet with delight I watched, and with
small concern.
The rosy mirror scratched by that secret
thorn:
And down where the fantail trailed his
flame like a comet
And suns and scaly moons swam round
and round
I looked through the eye of God for one
clear moment
At naked evil spiking the luminous pond
And thought with satisfaction —or dim
remorse ?
That all was well with his strange
universe.

The Windstorm.
There is a spirit in the wind:
It travelled round the world to find
This paper skull among the stone,
And sings and whistles in the bone.
Where the sword-grass takes the hill.
Hear the music of the skull —
As if a tongue were in its head;
And the windstorm blows the paddocks
red.
Come plover, plover come.
Lay your brown eggs within this tomb;
Or, a moment in the wind,
Turn, and rest a troubled mind.

Your hand winds the clock
That holds our love and sleep
Inserted in the babble of days.
Oh, chimes, ring deep
That this high hour before love.
Before sleep, may echo in
The kiss that is release, the song
That is Between,
The Up imperative,
Forever of our world —
We shall endure Time, and Time
Is a spring curled
To snap with a twang of pain
Against beauty and the soul.
Oh, hand, wind gently ! Oh, bell , careful
How you toll!

Melville at Woods Hole.
A storm is an episode. The net of history
Will flatten above you again, compel you
back
To the niche and sheet of the past,
Where you are nothing; will take in the
one cast
These seaboard villages, this heaving
thicket of sea
Where blunder your frantic, huntsman’s
hands. The seven
Winds and the sun will hawk
At your name fluttering on the cleared
blue mizzen of heaven.
It is an illusion, a dream, then, that these
are still
And always yours —the sculptured
shadows of the coves
Crocheted with weathered houses
And wharves askew; that the falling
glass arouses
Your voice, dazing the clouds; that your
antique will
Whitens into sail and is ever outward
bound,
While over the clutching waves
Come skipping like thin stones the spinet
voices of the drowned.
It is a trick of the rain dismantles to-
gether
Four roadstead centuries in a staggered
curio-shop —
New England in one wry gable.
The engine, crouching by the wharf, is a
shimmering fable
Of timelessness. It is only in the furious
weather
We think of the sun as a wagon capsized
and burning
To nothing: each yellow hoop
Splitting, the unseated wheels slower and
slower turning.
With words as firebreaks, from the centre
of fierce art
You hold 'out your hands. But all is
kindling for the blaze —
Mossed bone or hump-backed folio:
The gesturing spar back to its wreck must
flow.
Out from Nantucket, cutting your dream
to the heart,
Drives the spry steamer. These, the
Vacationers, owe
Only an empty, snapshot gaze
To the blind old fisherman hunched in his
soiled blue.
In Eighteen Twelve the Chinese sailor,
falling
Back from the maintop to the glittering,
turning deck,
To the white, swaying arms,
Knew truth for a second: the night
watch, the dim alarms:
In what he had sought and loved the
voices of destruction calling,
In the cruel puzzle of the rigging, in the
simple swell.
The spin of his curious luck.
Wordless, foreshadows your tortuous
parable.
Words followed, and art: the carved,
grey, perfect rock
Near Boston Common. But God’s acre is.
pressed hard:
The words and the strange winged head
Shallow in the scoop of the wind. This
mortal bread
Of Man, hurled to distant waters, has
drifted back;
The squirrel, electric shadow, may seem
to pause
Vaguely as a sphinx, on guard,
While all passes. Cars swing to the Ter-
minus.
But wakens the lighthouse, peers to the
green, turbulent east :
The crazy captain, whose eyes are a
flenching knife,
Starting, cries up all hands.
Melville, it is bone you rest on, bone that
bends
But does not break. Gulls at each spring-
ing crest \ ,
Shiver; in their narrow, thirsting bodies '
is the germ.
The impulse of death and of life:
They are anchors dragging at a sea and a t
sky of storm i
Night’s province submerges the struggling J
waters. You pace
The shaken bridge, your maiming inherit-
ance knocks
At our hearts, inescapable,
Hastens us past the breakwaters, the shoal
bell,
To the devious truths of nightmare, where
rip-tides race
And seasons spindle to the ice-floe.
Swiftly we move,
Hull down, under heeling trucks,
Towards the wfyte, flying vision of terror j
and love.

WATER IN THE
SHAFF
By GAVIN
GASEY
STEVE climbed
wearily out of
the shaft.
“Now we got
wa t e r,” he said
gloomily. “W e’ v e
had everything else,
so now we got
water.”
“W hat ’ r e you
talkin’ about?”
asked old Blue, look-
ing up from the aged
steam-winch with which he was tinkering.
“We ain’t deep enough. We couldn’t
strike water. You must be seein’ things.”
“Look at the soles 6’ me boots,” Steve
commanded indignantly.
OLD BLUE looked, and was amazed.
He scratched the thatch that must
have been red about fifty years earlier
to get him his nickname, and stood up-
right.
“Where’s it cornin’ in?” he asked.
“Where you’re workin’, I suppose?”
“No, through that old face.”
“Is it cornin’ fast?”
“list a dribble,” Steve said. “On’y it
wasn’t cornin’ at all a couple of days ago,”
“We better have a look at it, any-
way,” old Blue proclaimed. “Might dry
up tomorrer. Mightn’t amount to any-
thin’ at all.”
“Aw, you!” Steve said, in an exas-
perated but friendly snarl. “You better
have a look at it, or you’ll be kiddin’
yourself it ain’t water at all. You’ll be
kiddin’ yourself it’s beer!”
Steve followed old Blue down a lot of
ladders, reflecting bitterly that he and
Joe would have walked off the Irish Luck
months ago if it hadn’t been for old
Blue. The Luck was a worn-out
pothole that had never been any
good, anyway, ajnd it was located as far
as possible from pubs. State batteries,
and all the amenities of civilisation.
il \\f ELL,” Blue said in tones of relief
“ * when he was eventually poking
around the old face with a candle. “It’s
just a trickle, like you said. There’s no-
thing here to be worried about.”
“Hell!” Steve barked., “I was here the
day before yesterday, an’ it was as dry as
a bone. It ain’t cornin’ fast, but it’ll make
things pretty wet, now it’s started,”
“That’s so,” old Blue agreed cheer-
fully. “But provided it doesn’t interfere
with th’ work I’d say it was all to the
good. After the dry, hot, dusty earth
on the surface, think what a relief it’ll
be to you and Joe to come down to the
cool, moist atmosphere down here.”
“Moist! ” said Steve. “Stinking, brack-
ish, salty slush that ‘ brings boils and
sores out all over a man, you mean.”
Old Blue lit his pipe from his candle
and looked saddened. Dipping a calloused
finger in the puddle, he licked it reflec-
tively. An unbelieving look came into his
eye.
“It’s not brackish at all. It’s as sweet
and pure as the water from the best well
in the country,” he shouted.
“Aw, y’re cranky,” said Steve. “All
the underground water for a couple of
hundred miles round ligre is brackish.”
“Try it!” roared old Blue. “Try it,
you fool, an’ then talk.”
Reluctantly and suspiciously
Steve sampled the water. He then
bit his tongue, to make sure that it was
the organ that had never before let him
down, and tried a little more.
“All right,” he mumbled pessimisti-
cally. “It’s fresh. So what? No boils,
I suppose, but I don’t wanna work up
to me knees in water, fresh or not.”
“But can’t you see what it means?”
pleaded old Blue. “Where’s Joe right
now? Gone to th’ township t’ cart water.
It means nobody has t’ cart water no
more. WeTe the luckiest show on the
goldfields, with fresh water laid on.”
“I get the idea,” Steve admitted sar-
castically, “We paddle around in the
bloody stuff all day, an’ then come down
an’ drink it at night. If you want to
make a billy o’ tea, you lower the can
down th’ shaft, and I fill it with mud.
Not for me, thank you.”
“You’re a goat. You got no imagina-
tion,” old Blue said. “We use a pump,
o’ course. Dig a sump-hole down here,
an’ every time she fills up we pump her
into tanks on the surface an’ let her
settle. On’y show on the goldfields that
has clear, pure water laid on.”
“Where are we gonna get a pump, an’
who’s gonna pump it? 1 ” askedl Steve,
nastily,
“I’ll get a pump, don’t you worry,”
Blue enthused. “An’ nobody’s gonna
pump it. Steam. Th’ winch can drive
th’ pump when I’m not pullin’ dirt.”
‘ AN’T y’ see the possibilities,?”
' roared Blue the optimist, pointing
to the tiny, gloomy pool as if it were a
new ocean discovered. “We live more
comfortable. Wq devote all our time to
minin’, not cartin’ water. We get ahead
fast, an’ we foller up th’ leaders into a
big lode, What’d happen if we had no
water? We’d have t’ sell out to a big
company that could bring th’ water here
if it had to. But we got th’ water. We
got th’ water for a treatment plant. We
don’t have t’ sell out. We form our
own company, put up our own plant,
build our own houses for th’ fellers that
work on the Irish Luck, an’ there we are.”
Steve had been getting interested, but
he felt that in discovering a big lode
and making all their fortunes old Blue
had gone too far,
“Golly!” he said. “Pull yerself t’-
gether, Blue, or next thing y’il be grow-
in’ fruit-trees all over th’ bloody desert,”
“Hell!” declared old Blue, with a
visionary light in his eye. “That’s just
what I’ll do, first thing, to show you mugs
th’ possibilities. Not fruit-trees, o’ course,
but fresh vegetables. With water this
soil will grow anythin’, an’ as soon as
we get the pump going I’ll plant a vege-
table patch. Think o’ nice, crisp lettuce,
ah’ fresh carrots, an’ peas right off th’
vine with y’r tucker.”
“Gorblime, you’re mad,” said Steve.
But the flow of water remained fresh.
Blue got an old pump somewhere in town
and persuaded jt to work. In next to no
time the workings were again reasonably
dry, and there were tanks of water lying
in the sun on the surface.
When the dusty mail-car arrived with
three overdue bills, some week-old news-
papers, a parcel of meat and some pick-
handles, Blue astonished the driver by
ordering seeds.
“Next time y’ come out, you can bring
me two packets o’ these, an’ two o’ these,
an’ four o’ these, an’ a box o’ these over
here,” he told the driver.
“Gripes!” said the mailman, staring at
the dry, brown landscape. “What are
y’ goin’ to do with ’em? Cook ’em an’
eat ’em as they are?”
“I’ve brought my own sports model in case you run out of magic.”
“Neyer mind,” said old Blue haughtily.
“You just bring ’em, and leave the rest
to me.”
STEVE and Joe affected complete
cynicism about Blue’s vegetable patch,
but they were really very interested, Joe
even went so far as to help with some
of the heavy digging, and Steve sheep-
ishly planted some of the seeds when
they arrived.
Then one day old Blue was triumphant.
“Come an’ look,” he shouted when his
mates came up the shaft. “I think it’s
the lettuce, but it might be the peas.
I’d know for sure if you hadn’t butted
in when I was plantin’ ’em, Steve.”
Steve let the ingratitude pass, and they
were all very proud. The bare earth was
speckled with tender green shoots, and
there was no doubt that their part of
the desert had been made to flower.
But next morning old Blue, who was
first up, galloped back to their hut in a,
panic.
“They’re gorn!” he yelled, “They’ve
disappeared! ”
“What’s gorn?” asked Joe, sleepily.
“Th’ shaft or th’ boiler?”
“Th’ vegetables,” Blue lamented.
“They’ve pulled their heads back into
the ground or somethin’. They ain’t
there any more.”
Steve and Joe went out to investigate.
Sure enough, there was not a speck of
green anywhere. But there were indica-
tions of what had happened.
“Look, Blue,” Joe pointed out.
“There’s been rabbits here.”
“Rabbits!” said old Blue. “We been
here two years an’ I never seen a rabbit
yet.”
“There ain’t been anythin’ for ’em to
eat until yesterday,” Steve pointed out
Bluey sighed heavily. “Well, I’ll have
to get some netting to keep them out,
that’s all,” he said.
“How the hell are we going to afford
netting?” asked Joe. “Let th’ rabbits eat
the lot, an’ then they’ll go away.”
Old Blue had one of his brainwaves,
and the excited and eager expression
which his mates had come to fear
appeared on his face.
“Let th’ rabbits go away, nothing!” he
snorted, “The rabbits are a godsend.
I’ll get some netting an’ some cartridges
for th’ gun, too, an’ then we’ll have fresh
meat as well as fresh vegetables.”
So old Blue was allowed to get both
netting and cartridges, and when the
former was loosely draped around the
vegetable-patch the greenstuff began to
flourish.
But when the first of the vegetables
were almost ready to pick, disaster struck
again. One morning there was a hole in
the frail fence and the beds were a
wreckage of chewed and trampled leaves.
A large, dirty sheep poked its head
around the mine’s small dump, and said
“B-a-a-a! ”
41 CT KEEP!” Steve roared, enraged.
“Flamin’ sheep! Where did they
come from?”
In council later, the three gardeners
decided that the sheep, like the rabbits,
had been attracted from far and wide.
In the district a few hungry pastoralists
ran flocks, about one sheep to the square
mile,
“We gotta make a proper, strong
fence,” insisted old Blue. “We’ll have t’
put the nettin’ on solid posts.”
“Anyway, cutting some posts won’t
cost money. That’s something to be
thankful for,” Joe growled.
The pqsts were duly cut and a solid
fence erected. The sheep
and the rabbits both stayed
around, hopefully, and in
time they got their chance,
for the next raid was by
goats.
The goats were strong and
determined animals, which
had travelled overland
many miles from the main
goldfields town, on the out-
skirts of which they had
been living on empty jam-
tins, pickle-bottles and gum-
saplings. When there were
juicy carrots and lettuce to
be had, tank-traps and con-
crete walls would not have kept out goats
of such character.
Next day Steve and Joe were in no
mood to listen to old Blue’s hopeful
comment that after all goats could be
milked, and goat’s milk was recom-
mended by doctors
for people with weak
“What we want is
something that’s
recommended for
people with weak
heads,” Steve com-
mented.
But they consented
to reinforce the
fence.
AFTER the fence had been double-
buttressed and new posts set four feet
in the ground and the netting reinforced
with barbed-wire, Joe awoke one night
with a fiendish shriek.
“What the hell are you doin’. Blue,
snooping through the window at me like
that?” he bellowed.
“It ain’t me. I’m here,” called old
Blue, sitting up in his bunk.
Steve sat up, too, and examined the
situation. “It ain’t Blue, either,” he an-
nounced. “It’s a bloody camel.”
THE camel, much interested in all these
goings on and pleased by the warmth
of the hut, waved its sad face about
happily on the end of its long neck, and
emitted the moaning grunt with which
camels indicate pleasure. Along with the
grunt, it emitted half a pint of saliva and
a pound or so of chewed-up carrots and
lettuce, which landed on the side of Joe’s
face and slid off into his boots on the
floor. Joe gave another bellow which
tapered off into language the camel under-
stood, so the camel withdrew its head.
“Wild camels!” Joe bawled at old
Blue. “The camels have found the place
now. How are you going to build a fence
that’ll keep wild camels out, you old
goat?”
“Don’t tell us that a nice camel steak
will go well with our fresh vegetables,”
threatened Steve furiously. “Don’t try to
make us eat camel, or I’ll forget you’re
an old man and crack you one,”
“Not too old to have a go at you,” said
old Blue sharply. Then the usual tones
of sweet reason and optimism came back
to his voice. “But listen t’ me, boys,” he
said, “Let th’ camels eat the vegetables,
an’ good luck t’ them. I been thinkin’
about things the last few days, an’ I got
a better idea. Now the way things are
goin’ ”
“Don’t let us have any ideas,” Steve
bellowed. “We’ve had your ideas, an’ we
don’t want any more. You been a good
mate in some ways, but we can’t stand it
no longer. You can stop here if you like,
but Joe and me are off in the morning.”
In the morning they packed their traps
in the truck, and told old Blue that they
would get someone in the township to
drive it back to him. Only at the moment
of parting did Steve relent a little.
“You been a good mate in most ways,”
he told old Blue. “Why don’t you come
with us, an’ we’ll try a place where there
ain’t no water in the shaft to cause
trouble between friends?”
* i NT O water in th’ shaft!” old Blue ex-
-1 claimed, with the well-known
faraway look in his eye. “Why, as long
as the water’s there, the gold doesn’t
matter. Look here, you fellers, I’ve
applied for a pastoral lease in th’ names
of the three of us. We got th’ makings o’
great flocks an’ herds here right now —
sheep an’ goats, an’ rabbits for a little
sport an’ for the pot, an’ camels we can
break into harness if we want to. Not a
brand on any of ’em, an’ they’ll stay
right here as long as we can give ’em
water an’ greenstuff. We can open up
th’ old face a bit, until we get a good
flow o’ water, an’ instal a bigger pump.
We can irrigate acres an’ acres. Gawd
knows how much water there is there if
we really tap it. Gripes, when I git the
homestead built, an’ a few wool cheques
in th’ bank X might even marry agin, an’
have a smart little woman t’ run th’ house.
We can dam th’ gully there for a
swimmin’ hole fer th’ kids. But p’r’aps
I’m lookin’ a bit too far ahead,” he ad-
mitted, looking coy. “Anyway, y’ can
see it’s th’ chance of a lifetime, an’ I
applied fer th’ pastoral lease in our three
names. What about it, fellers?”
Steve felt a lump rise in his throat.
But Blue had that wild, dreamy look in

his eye. A mournful camel padded
softly up behind Blue, and stood looking
over his shoulder, chewing messily and
sagging at the knees. On the dump a
wild-looking billygoat tossed its head
about and pawed the earth, contemplating
a reckless attack on the camel. Steve
shook his head.
“You have it all. Blue,” he said sadly,
“Marry that smart little woman and share
it with her, an’ think of us sometimes.”
Joe unhappily picked up a bucket, and
walked across to one of the tanks. He
vaguely noticed that the sides of three
goats who were regarding the water
cynically were hanging in as if they hadn’t
had a drink for a week. Real goats, he
thought—worse goats than old Blue!
He splashed the bucket in so carelessly
that a teaspoonful of the water hit him
in the left eye. It stung fiercely, and he
dropped everything, yelped and mopped
at his face.
“What’s wrong with you?” Blue asked,
“The show you’re puttin’ on anybody’d
think it was hydrochloric acid.”
“It is,” Joe squawked. “Oh! Me eye!
Me eye! ”
Then a great truth dawned on him. “My
Gawd! It ain’t fresh any more!” he
yelled, “It musta been coming in salt all
day yesterday. I noticed it was coming
in faster.”
STEVE dashed forward and tasted a
drop of the water. A look of ecstasy
appeared on his face.
“We ain’t got the only fresh water on
the goldfields any more,” he announced
with evil satisfaction. “If this is just a
mixture of brackish and fresh, then we’ve
got the most brackish, saltest water in
Australia.
“What?” Blue cried in anguish. “Me
carrots! Me lettuce! Me animals!”
Blue rushed to the shaft instead of the
tanks, but he didn’t have to go down
more than a dozen feet. At that level
the water lay, still and smug, and so salt
that it would almost float a pick-head,
The water-supply was finished, and the
mine was finished,
“Well, mate, we’ll be able to stick to-
gether, anyway,” Steve announced. “You
might as well come along with us now.”
Blue wordlessly kicked a thirsty-looking
goat out of his path and stepped neatly
under a camel as he made his way to the
hut to collect his belongings. He didn’t
spare a glance for the ravaged vegetable
garden,
As they rattled out on to the dusty
track his pals were silent, wondering what
to talk about to take his mind off his
troubles. For Blue, of all people, to be
depressed was terrible, and their first
feeling of triumph soon disappeared.
They were miserable, too.
“Where are we going?” Blue asked
suddenly.
“Town first,” Steve said. “We deserve
a bit of town. Goodness knows where
after that.”
'T' HE old, eager light flashed back into
I Blue’s eyes. “Up north,” he said.
enthusiastically. “There’s a little show
up there me and Nugget Ross was workin’
before the first war. Never saw ground
like it. We’ll strike th’ yeller stuff there,
all right, boys, an’ next time we go to
town we’ll be able to buy the whole show.
Dry country, o’ course, or me and Nugget
would never have had to leave ...”
“Dry country, did y’ say?” Steve said,
“Dry as I Was ever in,” Blue declared.
“But that don’t matter much these days
with motors.”
“Real dry?” Steve persisted, “No water
underground either?”
“Never seen a wet hole within fifty
miles,” declared Blue.
“Then that’s where we’re goin’, old-
timer,” Steve roared so enthusiastically
that Joe nearly fell out into the road. “A
bit o’ fun in town, an’ then we’re off up
north to a good, dry place where there’s
no bloody water in the shaft.”
UP A GUM TREE
By
JESSICA CASTLES
11 O NSWER me! ” Ernie roared. He
f\ banged his bony fist on the
/ \ breakfast-table. An empty plum
jam-tin jumped and bounced
against a half-eaten damper.
Across the table Ernie’s twin brother,
Sam, tried to compress his limp mouth,
and went on stolidly stirring the black
tea in his enamel mug.
“It - is - your - turn - to-go-to-the-store,”
Ernie repeated for the third time.
“Ain’t it?”
CT TILL he was ignored. Sam continued
~ thoughtfully stirring his tea and look-
ing blankly at some cobwebs in the
corner of the shack. Like Ernie,
he was a thin, awkward man of
about 50, and his high-bridged nose
had an inadequate amount of pinched
brown face behind it. But his
brown eyes were softly stubborn,
whereas Ernie’s were fierce. In all other
points of outward appearance they were
as alike as two of the brownies Ernie
was so good at baking, except that Ernie’s
clothes were neater. The careful patch
of grey blanket on the knee of his tweed
pants showed a nicer degree of self-
respect than the roughly-cobbled rents
in Sam’s clothes.
A gust of irritation agitated Ernie’s
blood as he observed his brother’s empty
stare go past and through the cobwebs.
There was no doubt about it, Sam was
queer lately. Peculiar. Odd. And such
a strange form of oddness it was —not a
positive oddness like that of old Miss
Gleeson who lived alone at the top of
the gully and expressed her queerness in
a natural and easily understood fashion
by calling herself “Lady” Gleeson and
wearing a train and long white gloves
when she fed the fowls. But Sam was
odd in a negative way.
THERE had been the incident of the
yearling Sam had bought for a
modest five pounds. Sam hand-fed and
rugged it with the fixed intention of
making a profit of 10 guineas, and, con-
sidering the cost of having it gelded and
feeding it for three months in a district
where feed is scarce and expensive, he
had finally put a price of 20 guineas on
it. It was a likely-looking youngster, and
he had received an offer of 18 guineas
for it. He refused this offer at once,
but he continued grooming and feeding
the investment and endeavoring to get 20
guineas for it until the time came —very
soon —when the cost of even one more
bag of chaff would reduce his desired
■ profit. When that happened he took a
curious stand. He doggedly went on ask-
ing for 20 guineas, and just as doggedly
he neglected the poor horse. He wouldn’t
even groom it or rug it, and as it was by
then the beginning of April, in hard
mountain country, the youngster fell off
till it was a sorry sight.
It was useless for Ernie to argue and
reason. He pointed out that it would
have been the first bit of profit that had
been made on the farm for years if Sam
had accepted the 18 guineas. He had even
gone so far as to feed the animal once or
twice himself, but this had induced such
disconcerting fits of rage in Sam that
Ernie had washed his hands of the whole
affair.
In time, of course, the wretched crea-
ture had died ; and the strangest part of
the whole thing was the inexplicable satis-
faction of Sam.
Ernie’s irritation had died down while
he was thinking, and he looked at Sam
now with bewilderment. But he felt a
compulsion to make the fool speak. He
said: “I’ll harness Ranger for you.”
CT AM lifted his cup and guided it to his
' mouth without once removing his
gaze from the wall, and his brother
moved impatiently. It was ridiculous. It
must be the loneliness, Ernie decided,
feeling a little djzzy from such a pro-
longed excursion into the strange country
of thought. Week after week would pass
without them seeing a soul other than
themselves. Even the limited human con-
tact provided by a trip to the township
would be good for Sam this morning.
Ernie perceived this clearly. Usually Sam
enjoyed getting the stores.
Ernie changed his tactics suddenly. He
coaxed; “Be a sport, Sam. It’s your
turn. You know it is.”
Sam set his mouth tighter, as though
afraid he might speak in spite of himself,
but he gave no other sign that he had
heard.
Ernie was aware of a helpless rush of
impatience. For two pins he would get
the stores himself, only, only—he dis-
liked the township. He more than dis-
liked it: he hated it. It was the women.
There would be sure to be women some-
where about, smirking at a man’s clothes,
or maybe just staring. He hated staring
eyes, especially women’s eyes. Slinky
brown eyes, laughing at him ; or side-
ways-glancing grey ones, laughing at him ;
or flickering mud-colored ones—laugh-
ing at him.
“It’s your turn,” he said aggrievedly;
“sitting there like a bull-calf. Speak to
me !”
Sam looked at him at last, and for a
moment his brother thought he saw * a
shadow of that detestable laughter in the
only eyes that had never before been
guilty of it. But he was wrong. The
stubborn placidity of Sam was still un-
ruffled.
CAM rose and walked outside. There
' was something so calm and de-
tached and yet so purposeful in the
manner of his walk that Ernie got up
and followed him. He followed him
round the tankstand, where a cake of
yellowed soap made the sunlight appear
more dazzling than it really was, along
by the “big” paddock, where the uneven-
ness of the weeds showed that the ground
had been ploughed, some time, past an
old’ tin shed which housed a plough and
some odd bits of harness and then he
stood still and watched. For Sam did an
extraordinary thing. He walked over to
the nobbly old white-gum, and without
any hesitation at all began to climb up it.
"Go on, Martha—show ’em how you used to kick in ‘ Floradora.'”
For a moment Ernie thought his
brother was looking for a bird’s-nest for
some inexplicable purpose. It even
flashed through his mind that there might
be a cat or some other animal in diffi-
culties in the tree-top. It took him a full
minute to realise that Sam had climbed
the tree merely to sit in it.
Sitting up there in a tree, with his chin
resting on one sharp knee and that long-
suffering look on his face... It was
unbelievable. Ernie felt quite calm now
that he was faced with tangible evidence
of Sam’s oddness.
To climb a tree and sit in it as a pro-
test against enforced action. It was the
perfect retort of an unbalanced mind.
Unanswerable. But mad —quite mad.
And as for getting away with it...
Ernie said quietly, “Come down outer
that, you fool”; and just as quietly,
“You’re mad.” Looking up at that im-
becile face peering coldly down through
the leaves, Ernie came to a decision. It
was such a logical and reasonable de-
cision. The only possible thing for ( a
responsible man to do. He walked away
towards the shack, leaving Sam sitting in
the tree looking like a half-opened jack-
knife.
WHEN Ernie returned he had an axe.
His face was the picture of strength
and determination. He stared upwards,
smoothing the axe-handle thoughtfully,
and the sun ricocheted off the axe-face
in silver splinters.
“Now will you come down?” he re-
quested politely. But Sam didn’t even
look at him ; he stared blankly through
the grey-green leaves, away over the gully.
Ernie swung the axe. There was a
thud when it first sliced into the gum,
but with the second blow the axe rang
and a square of wood leapt cleanly from
the tree. He looked at the gap in the
tree-trunk a little uncertainly, and then
he raised the axe again. For a minute or
two he chopped steadily, then he had to
pause to control his breathing, which had
been so devastated by spasms of anger.
He leant against the tree as he rested,
and he glanced idly at the slab shack,
which looked unfamiliar from this un-
usual angle. There seemed to be too
much sandstone chimney and too little
shack. Somewhere in his corroded
memory he recalled his other brother,
Meredith, saying “We must put a veran-
dah on this one day. Should be a simple
job.” But Meredith had been like that —
ambitious. He had gone away to Queens-
land, droving, and things had never been
the same since.
ERNIE picked up the axe again. “Are
you coming down?” he demanded
ominously. When there was no answer
he went on chopping, and a pile of gum-
chips scattered around him. There was
no other sound to break the silence in
the gully, just the steady “chop-chop-
chop” of Ernie’s axe. It was fairly
rhythmical, and in spite of the terrific
jars that shook Sam where he was
perched on an upper limb, it must have
been soothing, because Sam looked
dopier every minute.
When Ernie had chopped nearly a third
of the way through the bole of the tree
he moved around to the other side, where,
his axe poised, he repeated his previous
question. This time his voice was ex-
ceedingly polite, without a suggestion of
impatience.
“Are you sure you don’t want to come
down and go for filestores?”
Sam gripped the limb more firmly,
stuck his bottom lip out further and went
on staring up the gully.
“Right!” Ernie announced. He went
on chopping with renewed energy.
Chop. Chop. Chop. Chop. The
sound rang out over the gully and was
flung back again in insolent echoes. Pre-
sently there was only a slender column
of wood linking the base of the tree with
the rest of it. The leaves at the top were
already shuddering, as though in antici-
pation of the crash that must come, and
for the last time Ernie paused. He raised
his axe on high, balanced it there and
without lifting his eyes he called up-
wards “Are you quite sure?”
I NTO the silence the axe fell again.
1 It fell once more, and this time the
old gum creaked and crunched and
slowly crashed to the ground.
Ernie leaped to one side to escape the
low, spreading branches ; he stood still,
watching the dust settle and the leaves
cease their trembling.
“Now will you go?” he asked softly.
There was no answer, no movement,
“Damn y’!” Ernie said bitterly. “So
y’ won’t go to the store, won’t y’! ”
He shrugged helplessly at the realisa-
tion that he would have to go to town
himself now, and looked about him for
Ranger. When he finally set off to the
township with the illegibly-pencilled list
—“flour, tea, tobacco” —he was as ex-
asperated as he had ever been in his life.
He drove off without a backward glance
at the figure lying beneath the gum-tree.

GENERAL MOTORS-HOLDEN’S LIMITED PROUDLY ANNOUNCE
HOLDEN
is now on display
at Metropolitan Distributors’ Showrooms
ẁ
Md This first public display of Holden is the climax of nearly four years of
intense and concentrated effort involving an expenditure of several millions of
pounds. We at General Motors are proud of Holden; we believe it is a really
good car and we hope that you, the people of Australia, will agree with our
opinion.
We think that if you list all you want in a new car to-day, you’!! find Holden
has paost of the answers. You 11 find the styling you want for this streamlined
age. You’ll find just the size you want in a new-design, Aerobilt body that
uses the wheelbase more scientifically to give ample leg and head room for 5
or 6. You’ll find a deep satisfaction with this engine’s 6-cylinder acceleration
and power. You’ll find the economy you want too many more miles to the
gallon than you would normally expect from such a lively power plant. You'll
find comfort and safety, high speed and easy handling. You'll find life, action
and thrills. Y ou’ll find that no car has been more expertly designed to suit a
country's needs than Holden has for Australia. It is a car made in Australia
for Australia.
Holden has a unique combination of features here are some of the highlights:
New-design Acrobilt body for roominess without unnecessary bulk ... overhead
valve 6-cylinder engine for performance plus economy . . . independent front
wheel springing for levelling out rough roads . . . 3-speed synchro-mesh gears
for easy changing . . . modern styling that is smart without being extreme.
ẃ
It’s a really roomy car. One of Holden’s big surprises is its
effort. Aerobilt construction is new in Australian body
building, and by elimination of the conventional chassis it
permits a better “room-to-wheelbase” ratio as well as extra
strength. You will find that Holden’s leg room and head
room compare favourably with any popular car.
.
• .
It’s an economical car. There’s more than a touch of
genius in the engineering of the Holden power plant. It
gives full-throated 6-cylinder acceleration, speed and power
and yet is as economical as many a small car. Owners’
as well as Automobile Club figures will be published as
soon as they are available.
(=3.
It’s a great car investment. General Motors have not only
designed and built a car for Australian needs they have
produced a car which is great judged by world standards.
And as far as value is concerned just compare how much
you get for the price you pay. No car in Australia can
beat Holden as a family or business investment.
There is an AIR CHIEF ‘s’ Radio
with 6-inch speaker especially de-
veloped and designed for HOLDEN,
General Motors wish to express their appreciation to the thousands of people who have demonstrated
their faith in Holden by placing orders for it “sight and price unseen” . Orders will be filled
as quickly as production can cope with demand and although you may have to wait a while , a little
patience now will bring a very big reward in satisfaction.

THEY CAME UP THE STAIRS
By W.E.
FITZ HENRY
EXACTLY what you do with a
flight of stairs, having bought the
same, requires some considera-
tion. You could, of course,
install them in a building and walk up
them. But The Bulletin building at 252
George-street has stairs enough already.
Maybe you could put them in a public
park—in Hyde Park, near the Archibald
jr j 5
Fountain, which would be
an appropriate enough spot
—and let anyone solemnly
walk up them, to no-
where, and solemnly down
again. It would be an ex-
perience : famous feet
have trodden them. But
a staircase wouldn’t last
long in the open air.
At any rate, The Bul-
letin has bought them:
the famous old Bulletin
Stairs, celebrated more
than once in song and story, from this
paper’s former home at 214 George-street,
the interior of which is being remodelled
by its present owners. What will be done
with them has not, at the time of writing,
been decided; possibly they will end up
as a set of book-cases, with an inscription
to tell of their former glory.
They ended nowhere in particular for
a lot of people who climbed them in the
old days; but quite a few walked up
them to immortality—minor or major—
in Australian literature; and in art and
politics. I saw most of these climbing to
their fate, for vi .tors to the editor had
to pass by a small office —a cubby-hole—
where for about sixteen years I had a desk
and coped with the callers.
S. H. Prior’s most regular visitor was
James Edmond, who had retired from the
editorship in 1915, but who remained a
prolific writer of leaders and political
paragraphs until his death in 1933. Every
Wednesday afternoon Jimmy would climb
the stairs and drop into the cubby-hole
to rest before going in to see Prior. He
would deposit his bulk in a chair beside
my desk. A well-worn gladstone-bag
would be tucked between his feet. A
walking-stick would clatter to the floor.
Then he would solemnly take two fear-
some-looking Manilla cheroots from a
pocket and hand me one. We would light
up; then Jimmy would begin to talk.
Perhaps he would take me on a tour to
Palestine and Syria with long calls at
Damascus, Jericho and Haifa. Or else
he would treat me to a dissertation on the
vices of the rulers of Babylon. He would
talk about Dickens; the economic situa-
tion in Turkey ; Chinese philosophy, can-
nibals and, missionaries. Then, rested, he
would depart, and I would not see him
for another seven days.
Jimmy had many strong dislikes, but,
according to Bulletin foreman-com-
positor Bill East, his particular abhor-
rence was German bands. “Before 1914,”
Bill would say with a chuckle, “they
blared all day long from one end of
George-street to another. Jimmy stood
them till he couldn’t bear them any
longer, then poured an armful of
‘Hansards’ out the window into an up-
turned brass horn. William Macleod,
down below in the manager’s office, had
to pacify the bloke.”
Bill’s story always reminds me of an
incident involving John Bede Dailey, a
Bulletin staff man for over thirty years.
On a windowsill on the second-floor John
had installed a box-garden which he used
to water every morning and evening. One
morning he flooded a minor poetess in the
street on her way to the office. “It cost me
thirty-bob for a new hat for her,” said
John ruefully, “though the damned thing
I watered was worth only half a crown.”
David McKee Wright, in the room
next to Dailey, came off best when a
female rhymester demanded an explana-
tion why her verses had been rejected.
After a preliminary parley she seated
herself on a table, showing a pair
of bony knees, and proceeded to read
her doggerel. David’s mind —and
eyes —soon began to wander. Look-
ing up, the woman noticed David’s
eyes focused on her knees. “I be-
lieve you’re more interested in my
knees than my verse,” she snapped.
“Madam,” said David gallantly in his
charming Irish voice, “they, at least, are
perfectly shaped and polished.”
David, during Henry Lawson’s later
years, edited Henry’s manuscripts when
S. H. Prior was absent. Only two men,
Prior and David, handled Henry’s “copy”
when I knew him, and I think he would
have torn the office down had any other
member of the staff altered a word. Most
of his manuscripts were rough, written in
a schoolboyish hand, and full of mis-
spellings. Very often there would be a
line or two missing from a poem which
Henry would send along when the right
words occurred to him, and there were
usually attached to each poem several
alternative readings of lines and alterna-
tives of key-words.
Either Prior or David
would correct the misspel-
lings, attend to the punc-
tuation, make a decision
regarding the alternatives
and include any missing
lines when Henry pro-
duced them. Getting a
Lawson verse into print
was always complicated
and protracted, since
Henry came along with
“corrections” for weeks
after he had sold the poem.
and would have continued to rewrite it
until the end of time had he been allowed.
More often than not I was the inter-
mediary between Henry and either Prior
or David in the process of ironing a
poem out, and handled over the years
hundreds of slips of paper on which were
written Henry’s “corrections.”
I remember Henry calling upon S. H,
Prior the day before Prior sailed for
England towards the end of 1921. Henry
was very despondent when he left the
editor’s room. “Prior’s going away,” he
said to me as he shook my hand, as was
his custom when departing from the
office. “I’ll never see him again.” There
was sadness in his dark brown eyes as he
took a firmer grip of my hand. “Non-
sense, Henry,” I replied. “He’ll be back
within a year.” That day, however,
Henry must have been granted a glimpse
of the future. He was to die the next
year at Abbotsford (N.S.W.) a few months
before Prior came back to Australia.
Upon his return, S. H. Prior threw his
“sprig of rosemary” on Lawson’s grave
in the form of a fine “Red Page” article
wherein he told of his last meeting with
Henry. “So you’re going away?” Henry
said. “Well, that’s the end of me.” Later he
said to Prior: “I’m a bit afraid of you —
you’re so damned serious when you talk
to me, you and George Robertson —that
when I give you a promise and don’t keep
it I’m ashamed of myself the next day.”
S. H. Prior and George Robertson
helped Lawson as no other men in Aus-
tralia did. Speaking to George Robertson
some months after Lawson’s death, I re-
member Robertson saying: “There were
times when Henry was alive when I would
have given £lOO to know that he was on
the other side of the world. I’d give ten
times that much now to have him back.”
When I repeated the remark some time
later to S. H. Prion, he said in his quiet
voice: “Poor Henry! Though it was not
always easy, I am glad
to say that he and I got
along pretty well to-
gether.”
The custodian of the
cashbox in those days
was amiable Tom Mc-
Mahon, who was always
good for a couple of
quid when funds were
low. Tom had a pretty
hectic time keeping
track of the advances
and in trying to persuade writers and
artists to square their accounts. By
crikey,” Tom would grumble in a kindly
way, “these writers take a lot of handling.
Most of them seem to have the idea that
this is the Mint, not The Bulletin office.
I’ve only run across one honest poet since
I’ve been in this job—C. H. Souter, you
know, the cove who writes under the
name of ‘Dr. Nil.’ ”
Tom had good cause to remember Dr,
C H. Souter, who wrote many a good
verse for The Bulletin. Something had
been accepted from him and Tom was
supposed to post him a cheque for ten
shillings. Tom wrote a cheque out for
£lOOO : 10 : 0 and posted it to Souter.
Back came the cheque with a note from
the poet. He was glad, he said, that The
Bulletin had at last realised his true
worth as a poet and appreciated the
prompt and adequate payment of his last
effort. He wished to point out, however,
that the odd ten shillings was probably
a clerical error and was therefore return-.
ing the cheque for rectification.
When in town, Randolph Bedford al-
ways called in to the office, and before
making the climb to the editorial depart-
ment would drop in and exchange a few
words with Tom McMahon. A noisy
fellow, you could hear Randolph’s
thunderous voice all over the office.
“Heavens above, Tom!” Randolph would
roar. “You Hibernian skinflint. What
if I do owe the firm sixty pounds?
Macleod should be honored, so should
Prior, so should you, that I’m ip your
debt. It should be a pleasure, Tom, a
pleasure.” Then Randolph would bound
upstairs and burst like a tornado into the
editor’s room. “Good morning, Sam,” he
would cry. “Good morning and God
bless the devil and all hi.s works.”
One Saturday morning Randolph met
David McKee Wright at the head of the
stairs. David was carrying two or three
bottles of beer. “What are you doing
with those, Qavid?” asked Randolph.
“Taking them home for Sunday,” replied
David. “Never do that, David,” said
Randolph solemnly. “You want to let
Sunday take care of itself. It is the wiser
course. Beer is better for a little un-
certainty. One has the pleasures of the
chase. Besides, accidents can happen. I
remember once when Victor Daley took
home three bottles on a Saturday night
intending to keep them for Sunday.
Victor’s cat knocked over one bottle and
broke it. Poor Victor was so upset that
he drank the two bottles of beer before
he went to bed on Saturday night.”
During the early ’nineties Randolph
lived for a time with the irrepressible
Victor in Melbourne.
The circle in which they
moved included Gros-
venor Bunster (“Old
Jack” of many Bulletin
paragraphs). Bob Whit-
worth, Jack Finnamore
and Teddy Ryan, all of
whom had been friends
of Marcus Clarke. Catch
Randolph in the mood
and he would tell stories
about Marcus until the
cows come home. Most
of them X have long forgotten, but
there was one glorious yarn that
Randolph told on a Friday afternoon
in the Star Hotel, of lawyer Jim Moloney
pleading with Marcus for hours one
night to end His Natural Life with the
death of Rufus Dawes. It was getting on
to morning before Marcus agreed to slay
Dawes.
There was always a great deal of traffic
up and down The Bulletin stairs on a
Friday afternoon —pay-time. As I com-
puted the value of contributions and
wrote out the pay-dockets I would hear
Hugh McCrae’s pleasant laughter as he
swapped anecdotes with Fred Broom-
field or Rod Quinn. Jack Abbott and
J. B. Higginson—both Boer War veterans
—could be heard debating some feature
of the campaign against Oom Paul. A
circle of sporting enthusiasts including
Con Drew, of J inker the Grafter fame;
Neville Forder, who contributed boxing
. 1 T ~ Cl/n
notes; and Lance s>ku-
thorpe, the buckjump
rider, would be yarning
about horses and prize-
fighters. Two old salts,
H. H. Cripps Clark
(“Two Seas”) and Walter
Snadden (“Albatross”),
both writers of many a
fine nautical chanty for
The Bulletin, might be
heard praising the work
of Ted Brady and Will
Lawson, two other masters of songs of
the sea.
Writers for the old “Poverty Point”
page had a habit of gathering together,
and Louis H. Paul (“Thespian”), Norman
Campbell (“Norbell”) and Harold
Mercer (“Hamfat”) would exchange
reminiscences of the days of George
Rignold and Maggie Moore. Also present
were knots of artists talking of gags,
cross-hatching and stipples in the jargon
of their game.
The cubby-hole on the first floor and
the famous Bulletin Bench —the subject,
incidentally, of “Red Page” articles by
W. H, East, Harold Mercer and Hilary
Lofting—which stood outside Tom Mc-
Mahon’s den on the ground floor, were
the meeting-places of contributors from
all over Australia, New Zealand and the
Pacific Islands.
From across the Tasman, Quentin Pope
and Pat Lawlor would turn up at un-
expected intervals. The Burns Philp boats
would bring on a visit from Papua the
novelist and short-story writer Gilbert
M. Turnbull or other of the paper’s con-
tributors scattered throughout the Pacific.
Paragraph-writers from Central Australia
and Darwin would rub shoulders with
poets from Tasmania, and artists from
Victoria would meet literary gentlemen
from Kalgoorlie. From the Gulf country
lon Idriess would make a sudden appear-
ance with a swag of “copy” and a claim
for payment as long as his arm, or else
Frank Reid (“Bill Bowyang”), Archie
Meston or Jack Elkington would drop in
from Queensland.
In the course of the paper’s 68
years’ existence the number of bogus
Bulletin writers must run into many
hundreds. All its prominent contributors
have been impersonated at some time or
another, Henry Lawson more times than
any other. A Bulletin reader —he was
a shearer —once remarked, “To be a
Bulletin man of note on a station or in
a shanty is something. This year at a
Western station the slushy turned out to
be Henry Lawson. It is very remarkable
how Henry disguises himself. I hardly
knew him —he looks different every time
I meet him.”
One Bulletin man ran across a fellow
in a bar who stated that he wrote the
poems in the paper signed “M. Forrest,”
unaware that the real writer was that
delightful Queensland poetess Mabel
Forrest. “Kodak” O’Ferrall appealed to
.. • t •_ j_ ...i
the curious birds who luce
to flaunt in the plumage
of well-known authors.
I have heard of several
who claimed to have
written “Kodak’s”
superb drunk stories.
One trickster even
offered to show a listener
the boarding-house to
which the alcoholic in
“The Lobster and the
Lioness” took home a
female lion.
“Gut west, along the Darling,” said
Henry Lawson once, “every other Scotch-
man one meets claims to be ‘Scotty the
Wrinkler’.” Next to Henry probably no
other Bulletin contributor was so often
impersonated as Phil Mowbray—Army
officer, railway draughtsman, lighthouse-
keeper, miner, schoolmaster, drover,
horsebrcaker, journalist, gardener, tutor,
sawmill-agent and sundowner —known to
a generation of Bulletin readers as
“Scotty the Wrinkler,” though another
bush paragraphist, Donald Fraser
(“Jimmie Pannikin”), ran him close.
Speaking for the Riverina alone, a fellow-
scribe who knew “Scotty” well said I
doubt whether there was a single shed
where he had pot cooked, while one
rarely met a drover for whom, at some
time or other, he had not ‘rdlledi the ash-
man’,” The fellow-scribe referred to this
when he met “Scotty the Wrinkler”
shortly before “Scotty’s” death. “Scotty”
replied that if the future held all the
drink impersonators had collected in his
name he would view it with confidence.
A roll-call of the regulars and strays
who climbed the stairs would run into
thousands. The color, variety and vitality
of the period has never yet been satisfac-
torily painted in literary histories. Many
of the minor men whose names were un-
known to the average reader, their
identities concealed behind nom-de-
plumes, were every bit as interesting as
personalities as the big names. Any
Bulletin staff man could name dozens of
them. Tom Hewart (brother of Lord
Hewart), E. J. Bradley (“The Deacon”),
Dave Richards (“Homfrey Beale”), Steve
O’Brien (“Jack Shay”), P. T. Freeman
and Bernard Ingleby—to take a random
half-dozen known only to their intimates
as Bulletin contributors—were in their
fashion as picturesque as many of the
celebrated Bohemians of the ’nineties.
The old staircase must creak still, with
laughter and admiration, when it xo~
members their tread.

Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Lady Dugan wore a beautiful frock of
pastel-blue marquisette with a bouffant
skirt and insertions of lace on the decol-
lete bodice for the opening night of the
National Theatre’s presentation of “Han-
sel and Gretel.” The Lady Mayoress,
Mrs. J. S. Disney, added an ostrich-
feather cape to her gown of shell-pink
crepe. Mrs. Philip Dare’s ballerina frock
of black faille had off-the-shoulder neck-
line studded with black sequins. Mrs.
Hylton Dale, in black moire and white
ositrich-feather cape, was accompanied by
her daughter, Mrs. R. D. Bakewell,
whose white floral printed gown was
worn with a short ermine jacket. Mrs.
Robert Hamilton’s sequin - trimmed
vieux-rose moire taffeta jacket was worn
with a full sweeping black crepe skirt.
Mrs. Dare Holyman’s apple-green bro-
cade frock featured very full sleeves. Pat
Christie was in blue-and-white-spotted
cotton; the hem of' the long skirt
trimmed with rows of white braid which
was repeated on the low-cut bodice;
white buttons trimmed the large patch
pockets. Pink and silver beading em-
bellished the bodice of Mrs. Horace
Stevens’s powder-blue crepe gown, Mrs.
Con Charlton wore a slim-fitting gown
of black satin with a floral pattern.
At her marriage to Geoffrey Tolson at
St. John’s, Toorak, Barbara Mary, only
daughter of Mr, and Mrs. F. P. Selleck,
of Caulfield, wore a gown of white slip-
per-satin, the moulded bodice of which
was encrusted with crystal beads and
pearls; these were repeated on the skirt,
which extended to a fan-shaped train.
Her Limerick-lace veil was mounted on
tulle and was held by a trail of orange
blossoms. Gardenias, stephanotis and
white orchids comprised the bouquet.
Margaret Walker, Dorothy Summons and
Anne Ogilvie were bridesmaids ; their
bouffant frocks of white tulle over taf-
feta featured .pleated tulle fichus dusted
with crystal beads ; in their hair they
wore wreaths of miniature Christmas-
lilies and stephanotis. Their bouquets
were of gardenias, white delphiniums and
stephanotis. The ’groom, who is the
younger son of the W. M, Tolsons, of
Toorak, had as best man Dr. Trevor
Telfer and groomsmen Bob Simonson
and Bruce Selleck.
At the dinner-dance which followed
at the Australia Mrs. Selleck re-
ceived the guests in a gown of milk-
coffee Chantilly lace, the skirt draped
and the bodice fashioned with a
cowl collar. In place of the usual
bouquet she carried a petit-point bag.
Mrs. Tolson’s dove-grey chiffon 4 gown
had matching lace godets in the skirt and
neckline ; her swathed turban was pastel-
pink. Mrs. E. Selleck, Barbara’s grand-
mother, wore a black tulle ensemble.
Among the guests were Mr. Justice
Barry, who proposed the toast of the
bride and ’groom ; Dr. and Mrs. Sum-
mons ; Mr. and Mrs. Vaughan Marshall
and Mr. and Mrs. Fred Howe ; Nan and
Pam Dixon and Joan and Judith Silk.
Back after some months abroad, Mrs,
L. M. Dunne gave a party in her flat to
friends and also as a welcome to Mr.
and Mrs. Campbell Lowe, visiting from
Dundee. Mrs. Dunne’s black crepe frock
had sequins on the bodice and draped
sleeves. Her daughter, Mrs. Ronald
Findlay, wore a ballerina skirt of bur-
gundy crepe allied to a bodice of match-
ing crepe and lace over pink georgette.
Mrs. Campbell Lowe wore a floral frock ;
her daughter, Mrs. L. Liscombe, was in
a navy sheer ballerina frock. Mrs. Nor-
man O’Kane’s brown straw hat with
large. taffeta bows matched her beige
crepe and lace frock. Mrs, Ormonde
Douglas’s black frock was a Christian
Dior model.
This year’s final meeting of the Ameri-
can Women’s Auxiliary to the Children’s
Hospital was also the final one for Mrs.
G. W. Campbfell, who has been president
of the auxiliary. With regret members
said their goodbyes, and Mrs. Campbell
is also sad at leaving this country, which
has been her home for the past 12 years.
With her husband and family she will go
first to Chicago and will then leave
America for foreign service elsewhere.
Among guests at the subsequent after-
noon party at the Australia was Mrs.
W. W. Killough, who will begin her duties
as president of the auxiliary early next
year; her turquoise-blue Wool jacket-
suit was worn with a white hat which
had trimmings of white, cardinal-red and
royal-blue taffeta ribbon. Mrs. O.
Lampard’s snappy mushroom hat of
natural straw trimmed with flowers made
contrast to her periwinkle-blue jacket-
suit. Treasurer Mrs. John Molyneaux’s
fine-checked suit was worn with a white
ribbon-trimmed royal-blue straw hat.
Mrs. A. E. Hotchkiss, in a tailored black
suit and small black hat, was accompanied
by her sister-in-law, Mrs. Deane Schooler,
a recent arrival from America.
P. F. O’Collins, chairman of directors
of the King’s Theatre, was host at a
preview of “It Happened on Fifth
Avenue” and the cheery buffet-luncheon
party which followed. Mrs. O’Collins,
wearing a black tailored suit and off-the-
face’ hat, accompanied her husband.
Daughter Mrs. Jim Peters, who recently
returned from England, helped with the
hostessing. Among those who enjoyed
film and party were Mrs. Harold Pike,
Mrs. Tom Davidson, Mrs. Victor Cor-
naga and her daughter, Margot.
Barbara, only daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Ira B. Hughes, of Camberwell, is
an entrant in the “Miss Australia” quest.
Barbara was born at Maffra and was
educated at Ruyton. A tennis and riding
enthusiast, she is private secretary to her
uncle, and also does mannequin work.

Bowls of gladioli and delphiniums com-
prised the floral background for the
“Night at Giro’s” held at this newest of
the city’s nightclubs by Mrs. Wallace
Mitchell and a small committee to raise
funds for Barbara’s candidature. Mrs.
Mitchell, in flowing Parma - violet
draperies, saw that everything went
smoothly. Barbara’s gown was of del-
blue taffeta striped in silver and a darker
shade of blue. Pannier draping was
featured on the skirt, and the bodice was
fashioned with one bare shoulder.
Members of the committee included Mrs.
Norman Spry, whose period gown of
white crepe was highlighted with silver
bead trimming; Mrs. Eric Cottrell, in a
turquoise chiffon gown which had a full
knife-pleated skirt; and Mrs. S. Aarons,
whose chiffon gown was in royal-blue
tonings. A beautiful gown of turquoise-
blue crepe was worn by Vera Pritchard ,
the slim skirt was draped to one side, and
heavy gold embroideries were featured on
the bodice and shoulder-straps. Mrs.
Charles Summers’s bouffant gown was of
black-spotted net. Mrs. W. McDermotts
white chiffon gown was full and flowing.
Helen Campbell wore a gown of ice-blue
silk-jersey; her sister, Nancy Woodrow,
was in white crepe.
The meeting sponsored by the Moonee
Valley Race Committee for the Jockeys’
Benevolent Fund was well attended,
although many familiars were missing
from the members’ enclosure. With her
navy linen jacket-suit, which had white
saddle-stitohing, Mrs. S. Cain wore a
high-crowned navy felt hat. Mrs. E.
Elkin’s black crepe tailored frock was
worn wkh a natural straw hat laced with
black velvet ribbon. Mrs. Bowen Allen
lopped her white hailspot muslin frock
with a mushroom-shaped white straw
hat. Navy and white tulle swathed the
crown of the hat worn by Mrs. R. P.
Griffiths with her white-beaded navy
frock. The beige taffeta bows in Mrs.
A. E. Kimpton’s tan hat were matched by
her gloves. A wide-brimmed Leghorn
hat and tailored London-tan linen suit
comprised Mrs. Douglas Falkiner s out-
fit. Mrs. W. K. Burnside’s nigger-brown
jacket-suit hid gold beads on collar and
pockets; her hat was of nigger-brown
satin and straw. Kathleen Syme teamed
a black-and-white-printed silk frock and
green - velvet - trimmed black upswept
straw hat. Mrs. Pultney Mein’s black
silk jacket-suit had facings of blue and
mauve silk; her mauve straw hat was
trimmed with parma-violet ribbon and
veiling. White grosgrain ribbon edged
the jacket of Mrs. A. Aitken’s white-
spotted burgundy silk suit. Floral frock
and raspberry-red coat were the choice of
Mrs. W. G. Breading. Mrs. R. L. Leach’s
black silk ensemble contrasted with a
shell-pink blouse and touches of pink on
her small back hat. Lady Linton’s beige
tailored frock was worn with a scarlet
coat; red roses trimmed her beige-and-
red-lace straw hat. Mrs. T. Allan Mc-
Kay’s pink-and-blue rose-trimmed hat
was worn with a black silk jacket-suit.
From Sydney
The bandsmen, especially the drum-
mers, held a great audience spellbound
at Victoria Barracks last Friday after-
noon. To their own martial music-they
marched and wheeled in a changing pat-
tern with a litheness and sense of timing
that no ballet-master could, have found
fault with. Their scarlet coats, white
belts and white helmets polished off with
little steel knobs were bright glitter on
the green sward of the parade-ground to
the left of the main gates of the barracks.
They were the principal actors in a Cere-
monial Retreat, which ritual is as British
as the British Empire. The drummers
twirling their sticks, or bringing them
smartly to the level of their lips, held
the gaze of hundreds gazing from the
balconies, from the outskirts of the
ground behind the low hedges of
hydrangea.
The company of blue-uniformed,
white-helmeted soldiers taking part
in the ceremony were not so ani-
mated. They shouldered arms, they
sloped arms, they fired a, volley or two,
but for the most part they stood with their
backs sternly turned on the music-makers,
their gaze on the tall flagpole on which
Australia’s flag flew, stiffly-proud, in the
suddenly-awakened southerly. Over
all the Governor, Lieut.-General North-
cott, and G.O.C. Eastern Command,
Lieut.-General Berryman, bent the stern
gaze of the cognoscenti.
Earlier the General and Mrs. Berryman
had given an official tea party. Then after
the last red coat had disappeared and the
beat of the drums had died away, every-
body popped along to the drill-hall for the
United Services dance. There was music
in the drill-hall, and foaming jugs of beer
on every table. The Governor came - to
the party, and with the General and Mrs.
Berryman stood talking to old friends.
Colonel Spain was another of the popular.
Near by sat daughter Mrs. Russell, with
sons Peter and David. Pink as the
clover from the hillside of Waitati was
Mrs. L. A. Robb’s draped frock. On her
cream suit the wife of Major Manley wore
a deep sapphire and gold crown remind-
ful of the Crown jewels in the Tower.
Major Joyce Snelling was there with
graceful daughter Jennifer. Colonel
Mann and his dark-eyed wife, who go
off to Melbourne in the New Year, Mrs.
Paddy Moore and her colonel. General
and Mrs. Herring, the Mac Nicol lady
were seen and noted. Two graceful
young dancers were Ann Berryman and
Mrs. Peter Oxley. Happy group was the
Keith Morris party. Slim Anne Cotton,
from Queensland, was among their guests.
Gladys Lister, writer of those popular
juvenile books: The Little Round House,
The Little Round Garden and com-
panion stories, is now writing for the
12-and-upwards girls of this land. Her
new book. Whither Jennifer?, will be
released from the presses some time this
week, so it’s in good time for the
Christmas shopping list. The setting is
Vaucluse, and the McCathie home, The
Hermitage, figures largely in the story.
In the book, though, it is known as
Valley Heights. However, all the char-
acters are fictitious. Jacket cover was
designed by the author, one time a pupil
of Julian Ashton. Photograph of the
author from Max Dupain.
Marjorie Hoskins became Mrs. Jock
Pagan in All Saints’ Church, Sutton
Forest, last Saturday. The bride’s parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Cecil Hoskins, held recep-
tion at their home, Invergowrie, Exeter,
at which over 200 guests (Sydney and
inter-State) were present. ’Groom’s
parents are the David Pagans, of Vau-
cluse.
The Danes have their Prince with them
—right here in Sydney. He’s not Hamlet
and he’s not melancholy. He’s Prince
Axel, and cuts out all formality. He was
the life and soul of the lunch party
at the Kirribilli Yacht Squadron in
his honor. Nearly all the guests were
shipping men. H.R.H.’s knee reflexes
are all right, too. You should have seen
him hop on a chair to take a photograph
of the table surrounded by guests.
The Society of Women Writers had a
merry Christmas lunch in the Feminist
Club rooms last week. With guests, the
company numbered about 100. Big event
of the day was the “pudding” stunt
thought up by secretary Etta Cowan.
Etta, in the cap and apron of a chef, was
found busy stirring a pudding when the
guests arrived. Each newcomer was in-
vited to throw in some fruit (silver coins)
and give the mixture a stir. By the time
the Countess de Vilme-Hautmont and her
friend had burst into the first Christmas
carol there was quite a lot of money in
the basin for food parcels for the women
writers in England. Two of the society’s
poets who have been absent through ill
health were welcomed, Ivy Moore and
Marjorie Quinn, vice-president Marie
Marshall making graceful references to
their work. The president gave her
Christmas message to the society over a
great bunch of red and paley-pink roses
presented by Mrs. Sydney Herring.
Mrs. Bertie Kelly last week received
the three medals awarded to her son
Carleton Kelly. Carleton, who served
through the war with the R.A.F., died
recently in Tasmania. The medals are
the service one, 1939-1945, the Italian
Star —he was a bomber pilot over Italy,
July, 1943, When in the Eighth Army
under Montgomery —and the African
Star and bar. It is sad to think that the
young soldier did not live to receive his
decorations, but his mother looks for-
ward to the day when they will be a
pride to his small daughter Carol, who
will be six years old on Christmas Day.
In town today, view to matrimony, is
Janet Margaret Hamilton, only daughter
of the Lewis Hamiltons, of Ravenswood,
Rylstone, N.S.W. Her fiance, lan Robert
Officer, comes from Victoria, so the
marriage has an inter-State interest. lan’s
parents are the George Officers, of Kil-
morey, Warrnambool, Victoria, and a
great company of guests from both sides
of the border will attend the ceremony
at St. Stephen’s Church, and the reception
at the Wentworth. A beautiful veil of
old Brussels lace will cascade over the
bride’s magnolia satins. Lily-of-the-valley
green satin has been chosen by brides-
maid Ella Yeomans for her frock. lan
Hamilton, of Narong, Victoria, will be
best man. Kilmorey South, Wools-
thorpe, will be the home of the bride
and ’groom.
The feig moment of “Louise,” from a
woman’s point of view, is the scene in the
dressmaking workroom where Louise and
a group of young companions are sup-
posed to be busy creating frocks. In
reality the whole place is vibrant with
romance. Each girl’s breast seems to
be a very censer distilling incense to the
tender passion. They sing of it. They
thrill to it, until the big workroom is
like an aviary of lovebirds. At last
young apprentices hop on to tables and
toss the component parts of frocks-in-
the-making into the air, thus creating, no
doubt, what the Girl in the Flat Opposite
refers to as Paris muddles.
You’d-have thought after all the mil-
lions of words spouted into the atmos-
phere that Lapstone’s Cafe Society would
have wrapped themselves in silent solitude.
But no ; they turned up in great force
(though not a full company—some still
stayed behind) at Cranbrook, where the
Aus. Institute of International Affairs
(N.S.W. branch) spread a late-afternoon
with all the trimmings. Probably
never in its old Government House days
had Cranbrook seen such colorful assem-
blage (saris, and turbans and national
dress), nor had'its gracious old reception-
rooms and terraces echoed so many dif-
ferent tongues. There was quite a rush
on the Russians present. This Letter did
not try to converse with them. She
thought their speech might sound like
Double-Dutch.
Even the Authors’ Ball is growing up.
It will have its 20th annual revolution in
the State ballroom on Saturday, December
18. Mrs. Ada Holman is president of
the dance, and she has been given by Mr.
Cousens, of Angus and Robertson, a
number of valuable books for the prize-
list. Ring XM6826, Ruby Illingworth,
secretary, for reservations.
Poet Rod Quinn had his eightieth birth-
day last week, but this time he held no
party owing to the recent death of his
old friend “Gilrooney” (Cassidy)., Niece
Marjorie Quinn and all the kinsmen and
-women trekked out to Mrs. Cassidy’s
home, which is Rod’s home also, bringing
a super birthday-cake. /Rod’s talk of old
days in the “News Review” of 2BL was
worth listening to. He spoke of early
days at school at old St. Francis’ with
Chris Brennan. A studio reading of his
poem “The Men Who Tried” ended the
interview on the right note.

The season of opera by the National
Theatre Movement at the Princess in
Melbourne was unique in at least one
thing. It was probably the first time a
full-blooded Australian aborigine had
sung in opera, and certainly the first time
one had sung in a Czech opera The piece
was “The Bartered Bride of Smetana,
and Harold Blair, the Queensland tenor,
took it with ease, though three weeks
previously he was as unacquainted with
the medium as his forefathers had been
with rifles. He'had the difficult part of
Wenzel, the half-witted son of the rich
peasant Micha. Blair, as most of his
race do, showed himself a natural actor,
and his voice was one of the best the
season produced.
Every week “Collier’s” magazine pre-
sents a Star Award for its best story.
Worth 1000 dollars, plus full story rates,
one Star last month travelled to Melbourne
to journalist Fred Howard for his yarn
Follow the Storm. Drawing his opening
breath in London, Howard was a bank
clerk until he got his first novel on the
stalls, in his teens. Royalties were at
first fat, but world travelling soon thinned
them; he took on journalism and visited
Russia for the Melbourne “Herald.”
Hitler’s war found him a captain with an
A.I.F. Middle East unit, where he formed
the A.I.F. Historical Record Section and
edited the Army’s first war-book, Active
Service, after which he spent four years
in New Guinea, Anchored now in Mel-
bourne in a house called High Dudgeon,
he casts loose in a light plane now and
again for pleasure.
W. James Riddell, who flew into
Darwin a few weeks ago with Nevil
Shute in a single-engined Proctor mono-
plane, will be remembered by New
Diggers as the officer commanding the
ski-ing school for troops in Lebanbn.
Previously chief instructor, he took over
command from Australian Colonel Bob
Savage, who described him as the
prettiest skier I’ve ever watched.” Riddell
should be —in 1936 he was vice-captain
of the British Olympic team. Before
Hitler broke loose he was in the Belgian
Congo shooting big game with a camera,
a flashlight and little else. Working his
way north to Alexandria when the storm
broke, then across to Jerusalem, where
malaria stopped him for a while, he was
appointed a political officer at Homs, in
Syria, mainly because he could speak
French like a native. Shortly afterwards
he was attached to Savage’s show. Both
authors are here to pile up
Shute for his novels and Riddell for his
travel books.
Mr, Chifley’s deprecation of it regard-
less, the old school tie is well represented
in the Cabinet which has emerged from
the Lib.-C.P. shindy in Melbourne.
Premier Hollway and Bolte are Ballarat
Grammar, Kennedy is Scotch College,
Warner, Minister for Housing, sports the
colors of Sir George Monarch Grammar
School (England), Kent Hughes, Guthrie
and Oldham are Melbourne Grammar,

Geelong College as their alma mater.
Oxford, Cambridge and Melbourne
Universities are represented by Kent
Hughes, Oldham and Guthrie.
“Trinco”; While a conference of Asian and
Eastern delegates was sitting at Lapstone to de-
bate prospects of raising the living standards of
their countries, Moscow, using a Communist
Javanese named Muso as its ladle, has reached
out a hand and violently stirred up the bitter
brew simmering between the rival N.E.I. Dutch
and Republican Governments. A school-teacher
22 years ago, Muso tried his hand in a revolt
against the Dutch, cleared out when it failed,
showed up in Singapore and was kicked out
by the British. Moscow took him to its Red-
lined bosom, and there he patiently waited and
trained for “the day.” Late this year he
sneaked back to Java, disguised by a Moslem
tarboosh, a well-rounded stomach, bazaar
Malay and the post of secretary to a ' Dr.
Suripino, who, sent to Czechoslovakia as the
Republican Government’s Ambassador, dis-
, closed his Communist sympathies when he got
there and was promptly recalled. He brought
Muso back with him. Once in, Muso unmasked,
preached violently against the Dutch and for
Russia, took control of the Partai Kommums
Indonesia (P.K.1.), and, following the Red
pattern in eastern Europe, and in Australian
unions, merged the Socialist-Labor parties into
his own show. And in less than a month
engineered the current revolt.
The Rev. Arthur Ebbs, who has re-
tired at 74, after 24 years’ practical
Christianity at St. Matthew’s Church,
Manly, is off on a year’s tour of England
and Germany. It’s a pity he’s not calling
at Canada, S. Africa or Maoriland, where
the mention of his name and Manly
beach would engender agreeable
memories in the minds of hundreds of
those countries’ servicemen whom he
helped during the war ; materially, with
beds and breakfasts, spiritually with the
genial manliness of a nature that is
doubly welcome in his calling. In London
he and his- wife will stay with the Beasleys,
and he’ll do some immigration work in
Britain before crossing to the Continent,
Sydney artist Sali Herman, whose
paintings of old buildings have been fer-
vently praised and criticised, is working
on a large migration picture. A migrant
himself —a Swiss, he came here 11 years
ago —he thinks the present migration
movement has such dramatic possibilities
that, in the absence of Governmental
patronage, he is tackling the .job himself.
He denies, incidentally, that he paints
slums.
Painting is a medium, like writing, used
to express thoughts to the people. The
writing or painting may be pretty, but it
does not convey the right picture of the
thought. Houses to me are part of life as
it is, just as human beings are. An old
man or an old woman may not be attrac-
tive, but may have beauty in their charac-
ter. So it is with houses. When I paint
them, I look for the character, regardless
of prettiness or dirty walls. An artist
should be able to paint mud without
making his painting muddy. He believes
internal beauty transcends external beauty;
a pretty woman is not beautiful unless she
has intelligence and character.
Since Herman’s paintings have been
pretty stringently criticised in The
Bulletin it is as well to hear his view-
point. As an official war artist in New
Guinea and New Britain, he won a Sul-
man Prize with his painting of native
bearers carrying a wounded Digger, and
the other day carried off a £lOO Bendigo
art prize with his oil-painting, “Railway
Lunch.”
Matt Charlton— nobody ever called
him Matthew —was almost forgotten in
Labor circles when he died at Lambton
(N.S.W.), aged 82, having been out of its
leadership for 20 years. He was of the real
Old Guard which refused to surrender its
principles to the Langs and Willises, and
to the Communist and near-Communist
leaders of the coal unions upon whom he
was mainly dependent for nomination and
election. Mining was always his trade,
and Lambton his home, save for two ad-
venturous years in Kalgoorlie around
MATT CHARLTON,
as Low saw him in 1918.
1896, during which he helped to form the
Westralian branch of the A.W.U. When
he came back he worked in South
Waratah pit, and his union activities
brought him into the N.S.W. State House
in 1903. He sat for Northumberland from
1904 to 1909, after which he went into
the Reps., where he represented Hunter
till his retirement in September, 1928. An
upstanding, dignified figure in his prime,
his status in politics was best summed by
his own remark to a friend when he
retired: “I am a Labor stalwart, not a
Labor agitator.” In the murky atmos-
phere of 1927-28 he was like a fish
out of water, apart from being
worn down bv the trials of leader-
ship, and was glad to retire to
Lambton and devote himself to his private
affairs and the local bowling green. His
only public office in later years was that
of alderman of Lambton Council. His
son, Percy Charlton, a Newcastle solicitor,
won an M.C. in World War I.
Depicted here by Coventry, knight
James Hay Gosse had just handed over
to the S.A. Government 3000-odd acres
of Younghusband’s Peninsula, a long
pencil of sand separating the sea from
the lakes into which the Murray de-
bouches. The Government, by experi-
JIMMY GOSSE —3000 acres to S. Aus.
mentation, will try to restore 25 miles of
waste sandhills to its former productive-
ness —it was pictured as a flowering strip
by George French Angas in his paintings
of early S. Aus. Gosse was born in Adel-
aide 72 years ago ; a list of his business
associations would extend this paragraph
to inordinate length. Instead it may be
recorded that he represented his State in
football and rowing, can still play a
useful game of tennis and is a son ot
W. C. Gosse, who was Deputy Surveyor-
General of S.A. from 1875 to 1881.
Revisiting Sydney for the second time
in 29 years, accompanied by his wife and
small daughter, Hugh Smith is a World
War I Digger who, disappointed with
what his firm had to offer him on his
return home in 1919, took the first avail-
able ship to the United States. He be-
came accountant to the California Sugar
and Western Pine Agency; in the early
1930’s he acquired control of it, and to-
day his firm handles enough timber
annually to settle one big problem in the
Australian housing shortage. Hugh
Smith is convinced that our oysters and
other shellfish taste the same as they al-
ways did—he rates them the world’s best.
His wife will take back to San Francisco
a dark, lustrous opal from Lightning
Ridge. .
Seventy - year - old Professor Charles
Schindler, who on his own admission
went to Queensland Uni. to study English
and has given French lectures there ever
since, ended his 37 years’ association with
schoolboy French when he marked the
last of this year’s Junior French papers.
Born in France, he graduated in law at
the University of Paris, dabbled in the
Inky Way for London “Times” and the
Paris “Matin” for three years, and came
to Australia at the turn of the century.
He entered Queensland Uni. when it
opened in 1911, and ended as Associate
Professor of Languages. Now he’s off to
live with his son in New Guinea, where
he’ll no doubt load his still-active brain
with the learning of Motu.
Meta Pelham, reputedly the Empire’s
oldest actress, has taken her last curtain,
at 98. Nobody remembers her first per-
formance, as Beatrice in “Much Ado
About Nothing” at the old Bijou in
Bourke-street, Melbourne, but plenty of
theatregoers remember her revival at 80,
when she appeared with Mc-
Mahon as Mrs. Coade in Barrie’s “Dear
Brutus” at the King’s. Meta Pelham
was 50 before she took to serious drama
and became a celebrated Shakspearean
actress. In her half-century of active
barnstorming she toured with most of
the best-known Australian producers.
A B.H.P. man, Eric Rudd, goes to
Adelaide Uni. as Professor of Economic
and Mining Geology, the first Chair of
its kind in Australia. A Maorilander
from Auckland, and a science graduate
of Adelaide Uni., where he got his M.A.,
Rudd has prospected over a sizeable por-
tion of Australia for coal and oil com-
panies, while at Harvard he had a look
at the main mining centres of the U.S.,
Canada and Mexico, and he’s done a
bit of manganese- and copper-hunting m
Maoriland and Fiji. In Borneo with a
mechanical-equipment platoon when the
Japs downed arms, he took advantage of
his whereabouts and poked for four
months into the N.E.l.’s mineral deposits.
Member of a string of geological
societies, he thus brings experience to his
appointment which should considerably
benefit the country’s mineral industries.
Between the intervals of bulling and
bearing there are some members of
Melbourne Stock Exchange who woo the
Muse, but Arnold Holst is claimed as
first to hold a show of his own paintings.
At the Athenaeum, it consists of land-
scapes, still-life and portraits. Septimus
Power was his teacher.
Dr. Lindsay Tasman Ride, C.8.E.,
0.8. E., recently appointed vice-chancellor
of Hong Kong University, is another
Australian who has distinguished himself
inside and outside academic circles. A
Scotch College and Melbourne Uni. man,
he was Victorian Rhodes scholar for
1922, having served in World War I
as a private and been twice wounded.
Later he became Professor of Physiology
and Dean of the Faculty at the University
of Hong Kong, and while in that post
was O.C. Hong Kong Field Ambulance.
Captured by the Japs, he cleared from a
p.-0.-w. camp and got across to the main-
land. There he was given command of
a British Army aid group. He returned
to ‘his academic post when war ended.
He is the first member of the university
staff to be rewarded with the vice-chan-
cellorship.
The Reaper has claimed Robert Gordon
Edgell, a pioneer who closed a crowded
life at Bathurst, aged 82. Born at
Hunter’s Hill (N.S.W.),'he was shipped to
Tasmania at six when his father went to
manage an insurance company there.
Destined to rank among the hierarchy of
N.S.W.’s bridge engineers, the lad of 16
became a cadet at Mt. Bischoff tinmine,
and later its engineering draughtsman.
Shortly afterwards Mort’s Dock in
Sydney took him on ; he learned to such
effect that at 24 he got the job of engineer-
ing draughtsman to the Roads and Bridges
section of the Department of Public
Works. He designed then works which
still stand, among them the lift-bridge
over the Murray at Swan Hill and the
swing mechanism of Sydney’s Pyrmont
bridge; and a good number of the roads
which opened up Maitland and Cessnock
mining districts were surveyed by young
Edgell. Along them he no doubt drove
the steam-car which he bought in 1903.
Retiring at 40, he bought 100 acres near
Bathurst, planting apples and pears on
the uplands and asparagus along the river
flats. In 1926, with his two sons in
partnership, the small pioneer cannery
which was to grow into the present ex-
tensive concern was begun. Young
Diggers will recall their extensive con-
tacts with its produce. Edgell’s three sons
are carrying on the firm.
Into the silence:
At Mareeba (N.Q.), Mrs. Mary Rains, a
widely-known bushwoman of the pioneer breed.
She reared seven sons and six daughters of
her own stamp, many of them still in the back-
country she knew so well.
At East Brunswick (Vic.), at 104 years and
five months, Mrs. Annie Sargent, Melbourne s
oldest inhabitant. Born in Dublin in 1844, she
came with her parents in a sailing ship to Aus-
tralia four years later. Her first home was a
tent at Taradale, when fiat town was a lively
mining camp. After 12 years on the goldfields,
she married at 16 and travelled to Melbourne
for her honeymoon on the first trip of the first
train to run between Bendigo and Melbourne.
At Wellington (M.L.), at 75, Edmund
Anscombe, well-known architect-planner. He
designed the Centennial Exhibition in Welling-
ton in 1940.
At Mordialloc (Vic.), at 62, Alfred Coleman,
land-and-seascape artist. A son of the scenic
artist who painted the sets for J.C.W. for half
a century, he assisted his father for some years,
then retired and went in for painting the
beautiful landscape round Mentone-. He ex-
hibited annually in Melbourne work which had
a simple quality about it derived from the in-
fluence of Meldrum, though he was never Mel-
drum’s pupil.

Finance and banking are the founda-
tions upon which the modern industrial
structure is erected. Hence the attempt
of the Socialist Government at Canberra
to nationalise the private trading banks,
Since this attempt failed to pass the test
of constitutionality in the High Court
the Government has appealed to the
Privy Council against the decision that
section 46 of its Banking Act, 1947 (it
provides for prohibition of private bank-
ing in Australia) is invalidated by section
92 of the Commonwealth Constitution
(which provides that “trade, commerce
and intercourse among the States shall
be absolutely free”).
The ultimate fate of the Act, which
contains the threat of subordinating every
form of industrial activity to political ex-
pediency, may well determine the pattern
of Australia’s future economic and social
organisation. It is not difficult to appre-
ciate how the' influence of a nation-wide
bank, immune from competition, might
be brought to bear to carry out the wishes
of its political controllers, provisions
against discrimination notwithstanding.
Experience has already demonstrated that
the temptation to differentiate against
private enterprise that is in competition
with a Governmental agency is very
strong. And even if private enterprise
succeeded in showing that the scales were
unjustly weighted against it, what effective
remedy, if any, could be expected? Under
competitive banking the client, if
aggrieved, has a remedy which would dis-
appear if competition died. Hopes are
that this vital question of nationalising
the banks will yet be one for decision by
the people themselves at the next elec-
tions, due toward end 1949.
Oldest and largest of the trading banks,
the Wales operates throughout the Com-
monwealth and New Zealand —only
about 9 p.c, of the business is done in
the Dominion —and there are branches
at London and Fiji. Last term a bounti-
ful season, strong demand and high
prices—a rare combination—produced a
bumper export income, which, among
other things, meant better exchange earn-
ings for the banks. Expanding industrial
activity and growth in retail turnovers
and inventories helped swell the volume
of bank business, too.
After making unspecified allowances
for taxation and all other contingencies,
the board wrote net earnings £111,371
stronger at £728, best since 1930. To
what extent, if any, appreciation of the
pound was allowed to bump up the
published profit figure depends upon
what was done in the way of providing
for contingencies. Total assets increased
by £3O-odd millions to a record £295.6
million. “This figure is swollen to some
degree following the revaluation of many
items as a result of the appreciation of
the N.Z. pound,” the chairman says. Ac-
cording to N.Z. monthly banking returns,
the co.’s liabilities in the Dominion ex-
ceeded its assets there by £NZ2.4 million
in August last. This difference is, of
course, very much more than offset by the
excess (visible and otherwise) of assets
over liabilities in Australia and else-
where.
The £728,903 of profit claimed was
8.3 p.c. on capital as against 7 p.c; for
the previous term; on shareholders’
funds (capital and reserves combined) it
was a moderate 4,7 p.c. The div. was
lifted from 6| p.c. to 7\ p.c., the final
being at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a.
Expansion of trade and other income,
etc., shows up in a growth of 14.5 p.c.
(£33,849,174) in deposits, etc., compared
with a growth of 6 p.c. in the previous
term. Advances moved up by £14,955,261
and low-interest-bearing liquids by
£18,706,259:

and N.Z.
Co. is exceptionally well equipped to
assist trade and industry further, subject
to central-bank direction, as soon as the
need arises. When the books closed
liquids amounted to 63.4 p.c. and ad-
vances to only 40.9 p.c. of deposits, etc.,
compared with 27.4 p.c. and 83.3 p.c,
respectively in 1939. To restore a ratio
of, say, 80 p.c. of deposits, advances
would need to expand to £213.3 millions,
or-£lO4 millions above the 1948 figure.
In other words, the bank could finance
a volume of business 129 p.c. greater
than in 1939; at present it is financing
only 17.4 p.c. more than it did then.
Pre-war experience, however, offers
little guide to future policy. The central
bank has instructed the trading banks to
discourage non-essential ventures and to
force borrowers needing new capital into
the market rather than to rely upon bank
overdraft. In this respect it is worth noting
that the proportionate rise in advances
of the trading banks has been less than
that of the Commonwealth Bank, taken
as a whole. This attack upon inflation
ignores the root causes of the problem
—wasteful 'Government spending and
lack of incentive to higher-production
efforts.
The £4O shares paid, to £2o—the other
£2O is a reserve liability callable only if
needed on liquidation—fetch £3B 10s. in
the market. At that’ figure the return is
4.1 p.c, on an 8 p.c. div. basis. Visibly
the cover is £35 Bs. in net tangibles.

Gains from higher metal prices and
increased mill efficiency were more than
offset by increased mining, treatment,
transport, smelting and other costs, by the
smaller tonnage and reduction in grade
of ore milled, and by the larger quantity
of lead and silver on hand when the
books closed —the metals were taken into
account at the low figure of £l2 10s. a ton
lead and Is. Bd. an ounce silver. A con-
traction of £264,264 in mine revenue was
only partly offset by an extra £16,626
from investments:

Net profit .. £461,670 £1,137,436 £979,822
Chief causes of the rise of £304,900 in
mine expenditure were (1) inclusion of
initial contribution of £70,000 to B.H.
mine employees’ pension fund and pay-
ment of a further £50,000 to B.H.
workers’ compensation fund, (2) higher
lead bonus paid to employees, (3) disloca-
tion caused by fire —still smouldering but
now almost extinguished—in old workings
at No. 1 shaft and (4) heavier but un-
stated expenditure on exploration, etc.
The saving of £394,924 in p. and 1. items
was mainly in respect of taxation.
Profit in the introductory table is
arrived at after deducting an unexplained
reduction of £1155 in reserves and in-
cludes £30,000 allowed for depreciation.
The £1,008,667 (down £201,146) is equal
to 7s. 2d. per ss. share, or 144 p.c. on
capital. The div. was reduced from 130
p.c. to 100 p.c.
The fire and handling of remnant
blocks in the British sector were mainly
responsible for the drop of 32,278 tons
in quantity and quality of ore milled:

Still, recoveries—97.3 p.c. lead, 92.1 p.c.
silver and 87.4 p.c, zinc—were the best on
record, which is a feather in the cap of
the metallurgical staff.

Average prices actually realised by the
co. for the year to end June last were
lead £97 (up £l9) a ton and silver 4s.
9yd. (down 3yd.) an ounce. The figure
for zinc concentrates, now all sold to
Electrolytic Zinc, isn’t mentioned, but it
rose, too. About three-quarters of the
lead turned out at the Pirie smelters is
exported, and the other quarter is sold
locally at the pegged price of £22 a ton.
Zinc, is pegged at the same level. It is
a parsimonious price, below cost of pro-
duction in each case, and calls for prompt
adjustment on these two grounds alone.
The Australian equivalent of the current
London price of lead and zinc is £l4l
17s. 6d. and £ll5 respectively.

On an extraction of 400,000 tons p.a.
there is thus about 13 years’ work mea-
sured up. A lot more payable stuff
is known to exist outside measured limits.
Sinking of No, 3 new 4200 ft. haulage
and downcast shaft has begun. It is to
be a concrete-lined elliptical affair, and
will accommodate two main cages, two
skips, an auxiliary cage and compartments
for ladderways and general service. The
winding equipment is designed for an
ultimate depth of 5200 ft. The idea is to
quicken and cheapen production. No
estimate of total cost is given.
Meanwhile the hunt for new mining
properties continues. Most promising of
these is on the old Zeehan field (Tas.),
where results of exploration, undertaken
in conjunction with B.H. South, should
be announced before long.
During the year £483,040 was added
to the book-value of shareholdings,
mainly in connection with Metal Manu-
facturers, Ltd., which paid 10 p.c. last
term:

The more-or-less liquid surplus increased
by £791,528.
The market prices the scrip at 87s. 9d.,
thus valuing the undertaking at
£12,285,000, of which £2,796,569 was
represented by surplus liquids at June
30 last, leaving £9,489,431 to be re-
covered from mining, etc. That would
call for divs. averaging over 69 p.c. for
the next 20 years. Immediate return at
87s. 9d. is 5.7 p.c. on a 100 p.c. div.
basis, or 4 p.c. on a 69 p.c. basis. Results
will depend upon the course of metal
prices, in which U.S. calls the tune at the
moment, and upon costs, still on the
up-grade. Statistically, lead is in the
strongest position among the metals.
North Western General Stores (N.S.W.)
One of the first to react to the new
penalty tax rates on private cos., North
Western General Stores is issuing 35,000
£1 ords. at Bs. premium to qualify as a
public company, and of the issue 20,000
shares will be reserved for existing pref.
holders. Purely a holding concern,
North Western was formed six months
ago to bring under single control the
country stores of A. C. Reid and Co., Pty.
(of Moree); A. E. Collins Pty. (of
Narrabri, Wee Waa, Bellata and Burren
Junction); Sylvester Butler Pty, (of
Mungindi) and John Foley Pty. (of
Emmaville and Deepwater). The holding
company distributed 140,000 £1 ords, in
exchange for the shares of the pro-
prietaries, face-value of which seems to
have aggregated about £lOO,OOO. Then
60,000 5 p.c, prefs. were issued for cash to
provide working capital; they didn’t
qualify for any dividends in the term
ended June 30.
All the issued capital of Hawke and
Treloar Pty. (of Gunnedah dnd Curlewis)
was acquired in June, while the business
of Sheridan and Co., at Coraki, has also
joined the team, making the number of
stores 11. Prices paid for these
acquisitions haven’t been published, but
to finance them an issue of 40,000 new
prefs. was made on a two-for-three basis
in August.
Recent statements in connection
with the first accounts, that “busi-
ness of the various stores conducted
by the company was well maintained dur-
ing the financial period,” and that in-
creased turnover was disclosed “in all
cases” are hardly reflected in the consoli-
dated profit figures; but these accounts
take in the results of the subsidiaries for
various periods ranging from six to 12
months. Trading profit, “after charging
administration expenses,” was £26,835, of
which provision for “tax and other items”
took £23,357, leaving a net profit of
£3478. This would have been insufficient
to cover the 7 p.c. ordinary dividend
(£9800) handed out by the parent, but
the parent’s own profit for the year was
declared to be £13,250, comprised of
dividends paid by the subsidiaries from
earlier profits.
The trading profit of £26,835 compares
with £31,723 shown as the aggregate tax-
able figure in 1947 for the four original
store-businesses before their amalgama-
tion. On that occasion, however, a full
year’s earnings was included for each
proprietary.
The first balance-sheet reads thus:
Consolidated Figures, June 30, 1948.

Since the close of accounts paid capital
has been raised to £265,000 by the
second pref. issue and will be £300,000
when the new ords. are fully-paid. A
full year’s pref. dividend will now require
£5OOO, and 7 p.c. on the increased ord.
capital will call for another £14,000.
Only the prefs. are yet listed on
’Change; at 21s. 3d. they yield 4.7 p.c.,
with net tangible cover of 575. 3d., and
their rights to the new ords. are evidently
on a one-for-five basis. The ords. will
have net tangible backing of 325.

Takuapa Valley Tift, N.L.
This Sydney - controlled co.
(paid capital £250,000 in £1
shares), operating at Takuapa,
West Siam, is back on the
dividend list again with Is. a
share (stg.), paid Nov. 30, mak-
ing total dividends to date
£8368,375—1a5t previous hand-
out was 6d. a share in Oct.,
1941. Takuapa section of the
property was repossessed Oct.
25, 1947, and Nos. 1 and 2
dredges each electrically-
driven 200,000 - c.y. - a - month
machines —reached selected faces
on Feb. 4 and March 10 last
respectively. To end Sept. No. 1,
working in low-grade tailings,
dug 940,000 c.y. for 131 tons
t. 0., and No, 2, operating mainly
in virgin ground, handled
1,010,000 c.y. for 217 tons t.o.
Combined figures were 1,950,000
c.y., and 348 tons t. 0., worth
£894,761, of which mine exes,
took £849,985, leaving profit on
working account at £844,776,
The Ban Pru area and No. 3
spud dredge are the subject of a
claim for total loss. Together
with buildings, etc., they stood
in the books at £890,000 at end
1947.
Co. has received advances
totalling £824,976 on account of
rehabilitation, and £837,659 in
settlement of its tin-ore claim.
Buffer-pool stock sold for
£810,139. Surplus funds have
been transferred to Australia,
where co, now holds £A113,660,
mostly in Government securities.
In addition there is £B5OOO in
London and enough in Malaya
to meet current needs.
A recheck of the Takuapa
property at end 1947 showed
12,620,000 c.y., averaging ap-
prox. 5.80 z. (0.361 b.) t. 0., still
ahead of the dredges. In addi-
tion, surface rights have been
acquired over all but a small
fraction of 43,015,000 c.y, of
8.280 z. (0.521 b.) dirt. So, sub-
ject to what happens to the price
of tin and costs, there is nearly
12 years’ profitable digging
ahead of the two dredges work-
ing at capacity. Costs are now
75 p.c. or more above pre-war
and still rising. There have been
stinging increases in taxation,
import and export duties, and
co. has to sell half gross receipts
from sale of tin-ore to the Gov-
ernment at the official rate of
exchange (tcls. 40 to £S), but is
allowed free use of the other
half (open-market rate of ex-
change is approx, tcls. 60 to
£8). Buyers offer 275. for the
scrip.
Gold Exploration and Finance
Co. and Gold Mines of Kal-
goorlie have received British
Treasury consent to transfer
headquarters and control of their
affairs from London to Mel-
bourne from the beginning of
1949. The idea is to sidestep
double taxation. First-mentioned
co. owns 30 p.c. of the capital
in G.M. of Kalgoorlie. The pair
has interlocking directorates,
and three members of the Lon-
don board of each co. (C. T.
Pott, A. J. Brett and C. R.
Davis) are to retire and three
Australians (Sir Walter Massy-
Greene, J. S. Murray and J.
Fitzgerald) are to be appointed
in their place. A close associa-
tion between the Gold Explora-
tion and Zinc Corp groups is
spoken of. Interest in G.M. of
Kalgoorlie has been stimulated
by developments at No. 3 level
on the Iron Duke lease and by
diamond-drill disclosure of a
number of other objectives
worth testing in the Iron Duke,
Australia East and Blue Gap
lease.

Meekatharra Sands Treatment
and Mining, N.L., which is
handling a heap of old tailings
on the Ingliston Consols and
Fenian leases (W.A.), has failed
to live up to expectations be-
cause trouble with the main
power unit has bumped up costs.
For the six months to end Oct.
last, 42,794 tons were treated for
18520 z. gold, an average of
0.87dwt., or 9s. 3.8 d. a ton, which
approximates bore values. Costs
were 9s. 3.2 d. a ton. To help
solve the problem the board pro-
poses to instal (1) a new power
unit and (2) a sluicing plant.
Cost is not stated, but the bank
is to be approached for the
money, and shareholders are
asked to sanction a borrowing
limit of £5OOO.

SUNDRY SHOWS
SYDNEY STAGE. 1948.
As far as the theatre was con-
cerned, 1948 was quite a full
year for Sydney with six good
imported companies offering at
one time or another and several
excellent home-grown shows.
Vaudeville moved out of the
Tivoli for most of the year to
make room for the Ballet Ram-
bert, the Old Vic. and the cur-
rently-showing Italian Opera
concern. Within a range limited
mainly to chamber ballets the
Ramberts were good with Walter
Gore, Sally Gilmour, Belinda
Wright and John Gilpin as their
main dancers. Gilpin, only an
immature colt, seemed to be the
most spectacular and most pro-
mising dancer of the company.
It was difficult to know
whether the Old Vic.’s; visit
caused a bigger social or dra-
matic upheaval. At any rate,
Olivier himself turned out to be
a very competent actor, studied
rather than inspired, but studied
right down to the last minute de-
tails in voice and gesture.
“School for Scandal” seemed the
company’s best mark, but all
three plays—“ Richard III” and
“The Skin of Our Teeth” were
the other two —set an example
that repertory groups all round
Sydney are still trying slavishly
to follow.
Sydney Royal managed to fill
in the year with five plays, plus
a short demonstration by a
hypnotist. Cicely Courtneidge
held the theatre for months with
“Under the Counter” and was
followed by an excellent per-
formance of Coward’s “Blithe
Spirit,” noteworthy in particular
for Bettina Welch’s performance
as Elvira. An American team —
Hartley Power, June Clyde and
Stewart Long—followed in
“Born Yesterday” and “John
Loves Mary,” the first a comedy
with some pretensions to social
philosophy, the second a very
lightweight piece on confused
identities. The current musi-
comedy at the Royal, “Annie
Get Your Gun,” looks as though
it will be in occupation of the
premises for a long time yet.
Sydney Minerva presented an
undistinguished dozen or so
plays, including Priestley’s “An
Inspector Calls,” Rattigan’s “The
Winslow Boy,” O’Neill’s “Ah,
Wilderness!” and “The Para-
gon.” The Minerva seems to
be caught in a rut—-both its
plays and the production of them
are only middling—and, if
houses are any indication, can’t
be making much money. It
would probably do itself and the
theatre in general a good turn
if it went all out to produce
good plays—it’s far better to
risk money on a worth-while
cause than a second-rate one.
As usual, the repertory
groups, with Doris Fitton’s
Independent and May Hollin-
worth’s Metropolitan at the
head of them, offered the
most substantial dramatic
fare. The Metrop. weighed
in with “The First Joanna,”
Dorothy Blewett’s prize-winning
Australian period piece, and fol-
lowed with “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” Congreve’s
“Love for Love” and is currently
showing the Coventry Nativity
Play and a sharp one-acter,
“Aria da Capo.” The Indepen-
dent’s best offerings were
“Mourning Becomes Electra,”
*‘R.U.R.” and the current “Rusty
Bugles,” by Sumner Locke
Elliott, an Australian Army piece
which excited the censorial at-
tentions of the N. S. Wales Chief
Secretary. Other Independent
shows included Priestley’s “I
Have Been Here Before” ; “They
Walk Alone,” giving Lyndall
Barbour a field day as the homi-
cidal serving-maid; a reading
of “Harp in the South,” a stage
version of Ruth Park’s prize-
winning novel; “Night Must
Fall,” produced by Dr. Carda-
matis; a competent production
of St. John Ervine’s “Jane
Clegg” ; and, currently showing,
an excellent , performance of
“Measure for Measure.”
Two other groups did out-
standing work during the year—
Cavalier Productions, with their
performance of Webster’s “The
Duchess of Malfi,” and the Mer-
cury Mobile Players with
Moliere’s “Imaginary Invalid”
and “Anatol’s Wedding Morn-
ing.” The Mercury group’s third
effort—“A Pickwick Story”—
was less successful. Veteran
Shakspearean Mayne Lynton
presented “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream” and “Julius
Caesar”; the Sydney University
Dramatic Society also essayed
Shakspeare with “Pericles” but
succeeded only in mashing it —
their performance of Cocteau’s
trifle, “Orphee,” was better.
Two repertory groups which
maintain a consistently sound
standard are the Kuring-ai
Theatre Guild and the Mosman
Theatre Guild. In a list which
included “The Whiteheaded
Boy,” “Love in the Mist,”
“Liliom,” “Time and the Con-
ways” and “The Animal King-
dom,” Maugham’s “The Circle”
was the Kuring-ai crowd’s most
noteworthy production, mainly
because of outstanding work by
O. D. Bisset and Jum Pendleton.
The Mosman group played
“Tony Draws a Horse,” “Bus-
man’s Honeymoon” and “The
Little Foxes,” the last-named be-
ing their most ambitious and
best effort.
Others noted with favor or
disfavor but always with
approval for their part in help-
ing to keep the stage alive—in-
cluded the Genesians (“Song of
Bernadette,” “Macbeth,” “Pride
and Prejudice”); Sydney Reper-
tory Theatre (“The Valley”);
Sydney Drama Society (‘'The
Truth About the Blayds,” “Full
Ho u s e”); the Australian
Academy of Dramatic Art
(“Quiet Wedding”); the
Dajonians (“The Astonished
Ostrich”); Scully Productions
(“Dangerous Corner”); Mina
Shelley School (“A Bill of
Divorcement”); and Modern
Theatre Players (“Money by
Wire”).
"The Barber of
Seville."
As the temporary surcease at
the Sydney Tivoli from the cur-
rent spate of sticky homicides,
felo de se and the incidence of
beauteous heroines melodiously
coughing their young lives
away, the amiable machinations
of a Spanish tonsorial artist in
trying to do a spot of match-
making between a lovelorn
aristo and the sprightly ward of
a waspish old ogre comes as a
breath of pure gaiety.
No overture has ever given a
truer indication of the score
which is to follow than that of
“The Barber” —a score which,
written in the incredible time of
15 days, coruscates along its en-
tire length.
A true disciple of Mozart, his
predecessor in the opera bouffe
field, Rossini injected into his
masterpiece not only laughter—
laughter which is always subtle,
playful and not without an
ironic steeliness —but really dis-
tinguished comedy. First and
foremost a melodist, Rossini has
spattered his scores with some
fine arias, and of these the best
is given to the title role. .
Sharply-etched characters
we can thank Sterbini’s ex-
cellent adaptation of the Beau-
marchais comedy for much
of it —count for everything in
this opera, and the interplay be-
tween them —the fatuous, amor-
ous old Dr. Bartolo; Count
Almaviva, the skilled lover;
Figaro, barber and factotum,
boisterous, a born “fixer”;
Basilic, the lugubrious music-
master ; the coy Rosina —was
made diverting by a cast
generally skilled in this type of
acting.
Head and shoulders above
everyone else reared Leo Pic-
cioli as Figaro himself. Early
after curtain-rise he proclaimed
in a ringing baritone, ac-
companied by humorous caper-
ings, his trade and his skill as a
factotum —and this skill he pro-
ceeded thereafter to demon-
strate. He threw himself into
the role with a vigor and rare
insight into the character of the
barber, and his handling of
the shaving scene was a
model of slapstick. As the
dithering music-master Antonio
Cassinelli gave strong support
to Piccioli and brought from
the depths of an astonishingly
thin frame a basso* of splendid
quality that rolled and rever-
berated.
Carlo Badioli’s Dr, Bartolo
had just the right degree of
amorous fatuity, and his rages
were faithfully produced.
Rodolfo Moraro raised a light
tenor adequately but with no
great distinction, and his his-
trionics were limited to some
semaphore actions with his arms.
The Rosina of the piece, Rina
Mariosa, was a disappointment.
In the high altitudes her colora-
tura had a harsh edge to it,
though in the descending pas-
sages at half-throttle it was
pleasant enough. Her acting, too,
lacked that spontaneous touch
so essential to the role. The
orchestra was well handled by
Manno Wolff-Ferrari.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
After -Herbert River had won the
Christmas Cup at Rosehill on Satur-
day trainer Maurice McCarten was
presented by Governor-General Mc-
Kell with the trophy, a cheque of
£l5O for winning the S.T.C.’s trainers
premiership, and another of £5O for
training the Cup-winner. Also present
at the ceremony was Mr. Chifley,
who, in his capacity as Federal
Treasurer, eyed the proceedings with
a detaching interest.
Apart from McCarten’s acquisition
of bunce, the S.T.C. on Saturday
distributed largesse all round on a
Christmassy scale. With the Cup
race carrying £2OOO plus £lOO trophy,
the seven-furlongs Festival Handicap
£1250, and all other events £lOOO
added money, total prize-money dis-
tributed was well over £9OO0 —rather
handsome for an off-season meeting
at a suburban course.
Herbert River’s success was, to
put it mildly, ill-received by the mob.
If this sort of thing continues Mr.
McKell will be fighting shy of officia-
ting at these affairs, though of course
Saturday’s demonstration wasn’t really
in the same class as the one His Ex.
heard when he was presenting the
Caulfield Cup won by Red Fury.
Finishing on generously after hit-
ting the front inside the distance
Herbert River won by three-parts of
a length from' Flying Duke and
Menelik; all three were well out in
the betting at 14 to 1, 12 to 1 and
15 to 1 respectively.
G. Moore rode Herbert River and
made it a generally unpopular double
by winning the Festival Handicap on
the 10-to-l chance Cragside, who de-
feated favorite Except and Blue Tulip.
Cragside’s form was sound enough
with three wins and a second from
his previous four starts, but the
Felcrag three-year-old had been
thought not quite up to the class of
the Festival field. It was a thoroughly
impressive performance, especially as
Cragside was conceding the year-
older Except 51b. in the weights.
At the Prize-giving Night of the
A-J.C. Apprentice Jockeys’ School
two weeks ago R. Pearse received a
prize as the most promising junior
apprentice. That was good tipping.
At Rosehill young Pearse performed
the remarkable feat, for a
ance boy, of winning the first three
races. Actually, his successes on
Rhumba downing Chartreuse and
Tivoli Star, and Field Boy beating
Delineate and Beau Caste in the two-
year-old events, brought his total of
winners to 10, so that when he then
landed the first Parramatta Mixed on
Keepros he was able to claim only
51b.
In addition to Pearse’s treble and
Moore’s double, J. Thompson also
rode a double, taking the second
Parramatta Mixed on Caruso and the
nine-furlongs Welter on Crusader, who
beat Torment and Opening. Chay-
tor’s fourth in the Welter looked a
fairish Summer Cup trial. The Auburn
Mixed went to Parrakoola, ridden
a well-judged race by apprentice R.
Selkrig.

Members and “deadheads” had to
pay their way into Moonee Valley
on Saturday, and did so in a good
cause. It was the annual meeting
in aid of the V.R.C. Benevolent
Fund; in fact the only source of
income possessed by this fund, which
annually distributes some £5OOO to
the relief of indigent trainers, jockeys
and their dependants. Sponsored by
the V.R.C. and M.V.R.C., the
Benevolent Fund was founded m
1914, since when it has distributed
well over £lOO,OOO.
Conditions on Saturday were tip-
top, and punters were off to a flying
start with favorites winning the first
three events. Most impressive of
these early winners was the brilliant
Kinderscout colt Regal Scout (G.
Nichols), starting at 4 to 1 on in
the Junior Stakes and winning as
effortlessly as he had done at his
two previous starts. Regal Scout
carried 9.1, spotting the dozen or so
other colts 101 b. each. While the
Hellespont colt Boghasi, having his
first run, set the pace, Regal Scout
ran along quietly ia midfield till they
entered the. straight, then won as he
chose; Boghasi beat the others as
easily. Boghasi should be worth fol-
lowing, as a second behind Regal
Scout is evidently good form. Sun
Chick occupied that position at Caul-
field the previous week and followed
up by taking Saturday’s Youthful
Stakes for two-year-old fillies.
A rarity noted at Moonee Valley
was the fact of two full-sisters each
having her first start in a race on
the same day and going very close
to landing a remarkable double for
owner E. A. Underwood. In the
Youthful Stakes Charkha ran an ex-
cellent race to finish third behind
Sun Chick and Rover’s Mark, the
margins being a half-head and a neck.
Charkha’s three-year-old sister Janeo,
by Dhoti-Wynunda, then made an
even more impressive by finish-
ing powerfully to down Regular Port
and other three-year-olds in the six-
furlongs Relief Handicap.
Success on Janeo enabled J. Pur-
tell to maintain a narrow (16-15) lead
over W. Williamson in the riders’
premiership. They had started the
day with the score 15-14, and William-
son won on Sun Chick.
The Collingwood four-year-old
Colin’s Pride produced a splendid
sustained run from the tail of the
field to narrowly defeat Deen Devon
and Dream Rocks in the Fund Han-
dicap (13f.) In front turning for
home, Deen Devon had looked home
and hosed, but Colin’s Pride passed
half the field in the shortish length
of the straight to score by a head.
Another good effort was that of the
country performer Eucardius- down-
ing other fillies and mares in the
Benefit Handicap of 10 furlongs.
Eucardius, who has now won three
in a row, starting with a Maiden
Plate at Woodend, is a four-year-old
mare of uncertain parentage, appear-
ing in the racebook as by Actor or
Lo Zingaro-Gusher. Monte Cassino
(R. Gann) won the Benevolent Handi-
cap, while the Appeal Hurdle went
to the even-money favorite Reynard
—very lucky to win after being in
strife all the way.

The Metropolitan Regatta, held on
the Parramatta (N.S.W.) on Saturday,
was an attempt to develop in Sydney
something after the Henley tradition,
and it was a decided success. Good
staff-work kept the long and varie-
gated programme moving smoothly
and brightly. Crews competing repre-
sented New Zealand, Queensland,
Victoria and various parts of N.S.W.;
in addition, there were events for
surf-boats, surf-boards and the like.
The New Zealand rowers scored
a splendid win in the N.S.W. Cham-
pionship Eights, defeating the Aus-
tralian championship crew Haberfield
over the Olympic distance of 2000
metres. Long accustomed to domi-
nating Sydney regattas and setting
the pace to suit themselves in their
races, the Haberfield men found them-
selves on the defensive right from the
start and were fairly out-rowed.
Though plainly not properly
wound-up, Olympic champion Merv.
Wood had no trouble in taking the
sculling championship, his fellow
New South Welshman K. Webb just
shading the New Zealander Schneider
for second place. Earlier in the day
Webb had also beaten Schneider in
a 400-metres dash, but Schneider with
his team-mate Simonsen turned the
tables-, in the double sculls. Sydney
clubs Haberfield and Leichhardt
shared most other events.

Von Nida is entitled to pall him-
self the best golfer in Australia. He
beat Eric Cremin for the pro. cham-
pionship in Hobart, 2 and 1 after
being 1 down at the 27th, playing the
remaining eight holes in 28. The
Von has always found Cremin hard
to beat.

The American girl Doris Hart kept
up her good record in the Victorian
Lawn Tennis championships, winning
the singles title and the mixed doubles
partnered by F. Sedgman. In the
"Here comes the Olympic champion!"
few weeks she has been here Miss
Hart has contested six events and
won five of them, a consistency quite
foreign to most of our players. Chief
upset of the Victorian matches was
the success of Joyce Fitch (the most
improved player in Australia) and
Clare Proctor in the women’s
doubles; they beat Miss Hart-Mrs.
Long and Mrs. Bolton-Mrs. New-
combe in the final stages. Geoft
Brown and W. Sidwell, after win-
ning the men’s doubles, fought out
the singles final, which Sidwell won
6-4, 7-5, 8-6.

From coin-toss to the last ball of
the match which Tallon smote for
two to make the game a tie, the
Bradman testimonial at Melbourne
was bright cricket. With some more-
frequently stodgy batsmen getting
right into the spirit of things, 1672
runs were piled up over the four days,
contributory items including 12 sixers
and 157 fours. Most players seemed
a mite exhausted by the last day, but
Tallon kept'things lively with a classy
146 n.o. in 123 minutes. During the
match some 17 “bowlers” had a
tryout, among them Bradman, who
took two for 12. What mattered
most was the attendance of 94,035
contributing £7484 to the fund, which
now stands at £10,200, with English
and other lists yet to come,

The Queensland abo. pug Jack
Hassen, who has been steadily plough-
ing through everything stacked against
him in pursuit of the lightweight
title, may have a much tougher time
when he bumps the wily" and ex-
perienced Ken Bailey. At Leich-
hardt last week Bailey (9.10£) made
very light work of Bernie Hall (9.12)
to win on points over 12 rounds.
Bailey has never fought better.

Produce More—Or Else!
Money is again rolling into
Australia at a great rate from a
wool clip selling at record
prices. Many countries regard
wool as the next-best alternative
to gold as a currency reserve
and protection against inflating
costs and prices. France, which
has seen three devaluations of
its franc in recent years, has
been a steady buyer of Aus-
tralian wool, and even Russia is
on the market at the present
time in a comparatively big
way. There are many other
countries buying at an extra-
ordinary rate, though the United
States is taking less of our wool
direct from us than this dollar-
starved Commonwealth would
like to see. Australian wool,
however, is being sold cheaply to
the U.S.A. by Continental coun-
tries urgently needing dollars.
Our national income is still
soaring, despite the setback in
wheat prices and the smaller
harvest. Landmen, however, are
experiencing only an uneasy
prosperity; their living and
operating costs are rising every
day—like the price of some of
their products—taxes are high,
and it is very difficult for land-
men to maintain properties or to
extend them, there being such an
acute shortage of steel, wire and
sheet-iron, timber and other
building materials, motor-
vehicles and machinery. These
land industries remain vulner-
able. to the possibility of a set-
back in prices, and it is perfectly
obvious that a fall in wool and
wheat quotations to the levels
we knew in the 1930’s would
find the rural industries unable
to support the inflated costs
burden and badly equipped with
plant, buildings and the normal
“improvements.”
Another section of our
economy that would be violently
affected by a setback in prices
would be the finances of the
central Government at /Can-
berra. At present the Govern-
ment is drawing off a tremen-
dous revenue from the people
largely by reason of its high
rate of taxes and the huge;
volume of the money-incomes
of the people on which many
of the tax exactions are levied.
If a contraction of the national
income were to bring a drop in
employment there would be a
greater burden thrown on the
“full-employment” and “social-
security” plans of. the Federal
Government at a time when its
taxation revenue would, from
unchanged rates of taxation, be
on a decline. There is no doubt
that the present financial policy
of inflated Government payrolls
and expenditure in force at
Canberra is one in which the
Socialists are flirting with dis-
aster —a disaster which, if it
came about, would be right into
the hands of Communists seek-
ing revolution through economic
breakdown. And Communists
have been planning along those
lines for the past 20 years.
It is unlikely that the prices
of raw materials as a whole will'
ever return to pre-war levels.
But it is equally unlikely that
they will stay at or above pre-
sent levels at all times in the
future. We must prepare for
setbacks, in private enterprises
and within the Government Ad-
ministrations, since setbacks
generally occur at a time when
costs are still rising, and an
attempt to reduce costs in the
face of falling incomes and un-
employment, as well as to raise
additional taxation in order to
look after the unemployed
(which increase in numbers at
such times), is. usually one
fraught with a multitude of
political and economic prob-
lems, Far better for us to
attempt to stabilise costs now,
and also to reduce taxation
rates, so that we shall then, have
a reserve in regard to both
when the financial weather
changes overseas.
The best way to check rising
costs is to increase production
per man-hour. This the wage-
earner's of the community are
quite capable of doing without
straining themselves. Even if
they worked only the 40 hours a
week that has foolishly been ad-
judged to be an adequate thing
from each wage-earner, but gave
a full 40 hours* there could be
a marked improvement in both
the output of the Common-
"I'll take this one.”
wealth and our costs of produc-
tion. As it is, production of coal
is below our requirements, thus
hampering all other industry and
raising costs, and our transport
services are being slowed down
to a point where the delays have
become a major factor in the
reduction in output per man-
hour seen so starkly over the
past 10 years.
This country, with the ball at
its feet, is being held back by
a combination of trade-union
apathy. Socialist experimental-
ism and sophistry and Com-
munist treachery. The x net re-
sult is a monstrous situation in
which the ambitions and eco-
nomic desires of the people are
frustrated in a way that should
be unbearable to them. A large
section of them have been
bought politically by fictitiously
high money wages, by phony
“full employment” and “social
Security” and by the illusive ap-
pearance of prosperity that pre-
vails at present. The sooner the
outlook really does become un-
bearable to this politically-de-
ceived section the better the
prospects of real prosperity, of
real social and industrial de-
velopment, will be for every-
body. A “Labor” party that has
bought its ballot-box popularity
through the trickery of a some-
thing-for-nothing policy deserves
to get the axe right in the neck
at the next Federal election. But
even before that opportunity
arises our shaky “prosperity” may
be in the process of cracking up.
attracting considerable attention
at the moment. The Dampney
method has the blessing of Pro-
fessor Wilkinson, recently Dean
of the Faculty of Architecture at
Sydney University, and it has
been approved by the Local
Government Department of
N. S. Wales as suitable for
single-story cottages.
Durability of the method has
been demonstrated by cottages
standing for over 30 years. Mr.
Dampney also claims that the
process is remarkably cheap,
provides a very comfortable and
attractive home, and makes
building much easier, especially
if it can be supervised by a
central controlling body with
national-minded and competent
citizens in charge.
The next step is to establish
such a set-up; an advisory
council working in coToperation
with a controlling corporation.
The advisory council would be
charged with the duty of organ-
ising research into basic raw
materials available in the terri-
tories using the Dampney
method and in assisting in tech-
nical matters of design, manu-
facture and construction gener-
ally, as well as in studying social
aspects ; the controlling corpora-
tion would license manufacturers
and builders in each territory,
and see to it that homes were
built properly and at a fair price.
The corporation is already in
the process of development, and
it will aim to earn profits
(through license fees) only in
proportion to services rendered,
with the initial object of pro-
viding low-cost and adequate
housing.
Mr. Dampney’s objective is to
i etain the best features of private
enterprise in his organisation and
combine them with a national,
co-operative movement in which
profits will play a secondary but
; nevertheless important part.
"Business ability is as necessary to
the success of the scheme as tech-
nical skill and research. Mr.
Dampney invites the assistance
, of all who see in the shortage of
homes a national social and poli-
tical problem, and who are pre-
pared to throw in their weight to
help do a big job in a new way.
The Sharemarket
Weakness in Australian share
prices continued last week. Chief
reason appears to be that in-
vestors are having less trouble
in finding investment outlets,
especially in view of the many
new issues now coming on to
the market. And there is not so
much incentive for speculation.
The weaker market for shares
in the U.S.A. is also an influ-
ence on Australian prices—■
without a great deal of justifica-
tion. In the U.S.A. there is
talk of a return of excess-profits
tax on corporation earnings, and
surplus production of a number
of commodities is in sight. In
Australia the production lag is
still far from being overcome.
Industrial shares here still have a
bright future, subject to Social-
ism and Communism.

Company Meeting
BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES
(Incorporated in New South Walet with limited liability)
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
President’s Comments
In his review of economic conditions during the past year to the Annual
General Meeting of the Bank of New South Wales, the Bank’s President, Sir
Frederick Tout, made the following points:—
Nationalization v. Democracy
Warnings regarding the effects of bank nationalization
cannot be repeated too often or too strongly. Thp tenacity
with which the Government, is pursuing its aim supplies
convincing evidence of a determination to overthrow the
system of private initiative and free enterprise and to
establish government monopoly or' control in every branch
of economic activity.
On the other hand, opposition to the Government’s legis-
lation remains widespread and persistent. “I feel sure,”
said Sir Frederick, “that if given the opportunity, Austra-
lians would reject out of hand the nationalization proposals
as utterly opposed to democratic ideals.”
PRESENT PROSPERITY
Last year, a bountiful
season and strong oversea
demand gave primary pro-
ducers a record income,
wMcb is the basis of the
present prosperity.
Unfortunately, the com-
munity's opportunity to con-
solidate the present favour-
able position is slipping past
through the inadequate re-
sponse of production to the
demands made upon it. To
the extent that goods and
services are not being pro-
duced, the appearance of
prosperity is somewhat illu-
sory.
Rising costs might easily
endanger profitable operation
if prices of wool and other
commodities fell substanti-
ally.
EXCHANGE PROBLEMS
While exports last year
were high, imports also rose
to a record level, and would
have been higher but.for the
dollar shortage. The neces-
sary, but negative, policy of
restricting dollar imports has
reduced the drain on the
sterling area’s dollar pool.
A more positive approach
has been made by attempt-
ing to step-up exports to
America, but we should not
expect this policy to offer
more than limited help. The
fact remains that Australia
can normally expect a dollar
deficit.
The generally favourable
oversea position of Australia
has led to discussion of the
desirability of changing the
exchange rate. With present
high export prices, apprecia-
tion of the Australian pound
in terms of sterling might
not affect seriously the fin-
ancial position of primary
producers and might help to
lessen rising costs. But the
problem of rising costs is
principally an internal one,
depending largely on the
level of production per man-
hour in Australia and on the
curtailment of government
spending.
PUBLIC FINANCE
There is some justification
for high taxation during
boom conditions to damp
down inflationary influences,
provided due regard is paid
to the necessity for encour-
aging future production. But
present tax policy is sacri-
ficing future prospects by re-
moving the incentive to save
and invest of those groups
on whom future enterprise
and development will largely
depend.
The Treasurer is building
up in time of boom a hard
core of more or less perman-
ent commitments for expen-
diture which will seriously
impair the flexibility of the
public finances to meet the
probable need for higher ex-
penditure on defence or the
trials of a future economic
recession.
The drift in State finances
is making the States increas-
ingly critical of uniform
taxation, which is also meet-
ing opposition as part of
growing resistance to the
concentration of power in
Canberra.
INDUSTRIAL
DEVELOPMENT
Continued expansion and
consolidation of industry is
evidenced by a large volume
of new capital issues and re-
newed interest of oversea
industrialists. This trend is
being encouraged by strate-
gic dispersal of industry, a
relatively lower increase in
costs, and greater financial
stability in Australia com-
pared with many other coun-
tries.
But the future is by no
means plain sailing. Indus-
try's hopes are being frit-
tered away by lack of a will
to work and the Govern-
ment’s desire to indulge in j
socialist experiments, creat-
ing uncertainty and per-
petuating the need for high
taxation.
A4830F
MAORILAND INDUSTRY AND FINANCE.
Land-ownership
Valuers sat up and Socialist
planners couldn’t refrain from
blurting out gleefully that
nationalisation of land was
ahead when a simple-looking
Land-valuation Court Bill came
before N.Z.’s Parliament in Oc-
tober. It might have gone
through all stages without hit-
ting the headlines, but H, E.
Combs, Parliamentary Under-
secretary to Minister of Finance
Walter Nash, made this little re-
mark : “Those who hold land
tenures today and think those
tenures can be passed on to their
heirs must readjust their ideas.”
To non-Socialists and Maoriland
property-owners this was “disin-
heritance” unveiled, and the
storm broke. Both inside and
outside the House controvery
was furious. Farmers threatened
to march on Parliament, and one
of their leaders, H. J, McLeavey,
didn’t mince words: “When you
take away a man’s property
compulsorily and pay him less
than the property is worth there
is only one term left to apply to
the process; that is theft,
legalised, no . doubt, but still
theft. It is a nasty word, but my
duty compels me to use it.”
The bill gave no hint of the
danger—its aim was. no more,
than to create machinery for
valuing land—but was there
some concealed sting behind the
plan to control prices for farms,
houses and sections perman-
ently? Combs had let the cat
out of the bag, and Combs was
Nash’s right-hand man. How
far would the Socialists go?
Would they be satisfied with re-
lieving farmers of some acre-
age where owners had more than
they needed? How much would
they take? Where would be the
stopping - point? These were
ticklish questions. If the Gov-
ernment wanted to put up de-
fences against land-inflation on
the scale seen from 1922 to 1929
and the heavy writing-down of
the ’thirties—that is, against
gambling in land and going
broke—the idea was good, for
nobody wanted to see farmers
walking off their land if they
struck hard times again. But
was this little scheme as pure in
conception as that?
Suspicion has been roused, and
M.L. defenders of private
property will be doubly vigilant
now lest the Socialists attempt
to overstep the bounds. Com-
plete socialisation of land was a
plank in the Labor party’s policy
in 1919, 16 years before the
party reached the Treasury
benches, and that aim has never
been disclaimed. For valuers the
new move means more fees and
more prestige, but as a group
they’re among the keenest de-
fenders of property rights in M.L.
Costs Still Rising
When knight Frederick Tout,
chairman of the Bank of N.S.W.,
lashed out at State clumsiness
and waste in N.Z., his comments
struck Maorilanders as a
masterly summing-up. His pic-
ture of Laborites sitting
on the safety-valve instead of
damping-down the inflationary
fires put import-control in a nut-
shell, and he unmasked attempts
at stabilisation, which “damaged
the delicate mechanism of the
price system and blunted the
edge of competition.”
Other shrewd strokes were
aimed at “cumbersome admin-
istration,” “wasteful prodigality
in social services,” “financial
mismanagement” and “State
extravagance”—a formidable-
looking list to business-
men. One of M.L. Labor’s
latest blunders is Government
borrowing of £21.7 million from
the Reserve Bank to compensate
the banks for losses on exchange
funds written down on August
20, when M.L.’s “new-look”
pound had its birth. Finance
Minister Walter Nash shied at
the hurdle when it came to mop-
ping-up surplus funds by public
loan, and said, “We don’t want
to take money out of purchasing-
power channels.” So he gave
1.0.U5. to the banks. Maori-
landers will get it in the neck in
rising prices.
Railway Transport
Thumping increases in rail
fares (15 p.c.) and freight (20
p.c.) in New Zealand from Sep. ,
14, 1947, have been swallowed
up by soaring costs, and today
the State railways are well over
£lOO,OOO a month to the bad,
after unloading the whole of the
£3 million annual interest bill
on to the shoulders of sub-
missive taxpayers. If operat-
ing costs hit the target they’re
heading for, they’re likely to top
£l9 millions for the year ending
next March, with revenue
lagging perhaps a million be-
hind if summer holiday traffic
helps build up earnings- in the
next few months, and more than
that if it doesn’t,
A poor show, with goods
tonnage around record levels.
But the catch seems to be that
the railways have lost a good
deal of the cream of the
passenger and goods traffic
to aggressive road and air
competitors, too enterprising,
quick and mobile for them, and
have taken a heavy knock
through coughing up £775,000
extra for fuel bought from the
U.S.A. at more than £lO a ton.
That’s the price ML. railways
have had to. pay for Yankee
coal to keep running when local
mining bottlenecks and strikes
threatened a crisis. From 1941
to 1943 M.L. bought Australian
coal for the railways at a cost,
including freight, of £2 7s. 6d.
a ton. South Island hard coal
today costs £2 13s. 9d. for North
Island railways, and there’s
plenty of it —underground.
Infantile paralysis was debited
with £lOO,OOO of last summer’s
loss, and the balance came from
higher wages and prices. M.L. ;
railways, with a capital outlay of
£74 million, have never been a
goldmine, but from 1931, when
£10,400,000 was written off,
which meant that the taxpayer
took over that much, to 1946,
operations generally showed a
balance on the right side, though
mostly below 2 p.c., except from
1942 to 1944. In 1945 the rot
set in. Today Maorilanders are
paying nearly £1 10s. a head
yearly on the average in taxes
to keep the railways on the rails.
“Smokes”
Tobacco traders in N.Z.
have taken plenty of knocks in
free-for-all in the past year, and
local manufacturers are licking
their wounds after the toughest
conditions for a long time.
Profits slumped, stocks mounted
and many fortune-seekers
burned their fingers.
One of the biggest of local
cos., the National Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., with more than a quarter
of a million capital, finished up
its year on October 31 with only
£12,033 net profit, against
£17,279 a year ago and £19,928
in 1946, and had to dip into re-
serves to Hold divs, at 1\ p.c.,
taking £20,680.
Chairman Gerhard Husheer
took the gloves off to “indis-
criminate importation of huge
masses of cigarettes and smok-
ing tobacco,” “market dis-
organisation” and cut-throat
competition. “Nerve-racking,”
he said. Traders, tempted by
visions of a golden opportunity
to grow fat, had found the im-
port door suddenly thrown open
and crowded through.
The “gambling-fever” was hot.
as cigarettes, up to 600 million,
flooded in, along with big orders
of smoking tobacco. Retailers’
shelves and merchants’ bonds
bulged with stocks. Chain-
stores, always most touchy about
lagging turnovers, set the pace
in forcing sales, with prices
chopped from Is.' 10£d. to Is.
4d. for, 20, to leave cheapest
local fags face to face with a
20 p.c. loss. But there’s still
a good way to go before the
decks are cleared for normal
trade. Import-control is - the
big bad wolf, which temporarily
let traders loose on oiie an-
other in a savage game of dog-
eat-dog.
Homes in Maoriland
Small bungalows, sheds,
shacks and garages may go up
like mushrooms now building is
decontrolled in New Zealand,
and a months-long deadlock on
many schemes should be ended
as house-hungry Maorilanders
and builders eager to get" on
with jobs are given a chance.
This is the rose-tinted picture
drawn since the Government
gave way in November, after
months of pressure from con-
tractors, architects and loCal
bodies, with the public barrack-
ing vigorously in the back-
ground, and handed control
back to municipal and county
offices, which did the job with-
out fuss in pre-war days. But
there’s a limit of 1150 square
feet on houses now, and builders
want to know why the figure
isn’t 1500 square feet to give
comfortable elbow-room for the
average Maorilander and his
family.
Houses will be cramped for a
while, but later on, when the big
rush is over, perhaps within a
couple of years, the Government
might be more generous. The
parish pump will now be the
source for permits for small re-
pair and maintenance schemes,
workshops, garages and a few
other classes, too, and District
Building Controllers will be
armed with a little extra
authority, mainly over schemes
for interior, reconstruction at
three-figure cost.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Solitude”: We had just sprawled into
attitudes more in keeping with the digest-
ing of underdone damper when young
Carruthers dropped off to see Seventy-
fiver. “Got a mob I want to take into
the Haunted Stream country,” he
announced, when the preliminaries were
over. “Isn’t there a track goes in some-
where from this side? Bullocky said
you’d know.” “That’s right,” the old
bloke drawled. “Y’ know the granite
crossin’ about twenty miles down? Wfell,
she goes in up that gully. Y’ won’t have
no trouble. The blaze is about shoulder
height, an’ starts on top o’ the ridge.” A
few details, and Carruthers departed. We
heard nothing of him for several weeks,
then he called, nursing a grievance. He
hadn’t got through to The Haunted. He
hadn’t even found the blazed trail. But
he’d spent some days wandering round
in the bush before back-tracking to the
crossing. “Cripes, the undergrowth’s so
heavy you have to fight for every yard,”
he accused Seventyfiver. “Can’t tell me
there’s a trail through there.” “’Course
there is,” the old bloke bridled indig-
nantly. “Why, I come back along it that
time I went down t’ the Melbourne Cup.
Had a win, too.” His eyes grew dreamy.
“Six quid, it was,” he murmured softly.
“Six quid. Ah, a real good nag, that
Carbine! ”
* * * *
“Tasmaniac”; At the cost of a good
hunting dog I learned a peculiarity of the
now-almost-extinct Tasmanian tiger. In
appearance rather like an Alsatian, its
spine has fixed cartilages, and so when
raised in open country by a dog it’s at a
hopeless disadvantage, as it can turn at
speed only in a large circle. But it has
developed a strategy, and ignores a
worrying dog till it can “cave-up.” Then
if the dog will go in after it, it is in-
variably goodbye—to the dog. Years ago
I saw a “tiger” hunting a ’roo, and if the
’roo can evade its first run it has a 50-50
chance, as the tiger has to await its
opportunity for another run. The only
carnivorous marsupial in the world, the
tiger dies, like all his marsupial relations,
m defiant silence.
* * * *
Trim”: It had been a long, tiring day.
ohaggy and the new machinery salesman
had called on a couple of dozen cockies,
travelled the best part of 100 miles
and hadn’t got the book out. Nearing
town just as the sun was going down,
Shaggy says “We’ll call in at old Ferdy’s
—sold him a separator about a month
ago and have to collect the bowl out of
his old machine.” Old Ferdy and his
missus and about eight of their 13 kids
are doing the milking. Shaggy introduces
j c .°kk er . an d then, being a good agent
and knowing his district, tells the sales-
man about Ferdy’s vineyard. Ferdy soon
says to Mrs. Ferdy “I g 0 show the shen-
tlemens the guips.” According to Ferdy
you can’t run a successful vineyard if
you haven’t got the right water. He picks
up a filthy old pannikin, dips it in the
tankwater through an inch of green scum
and hands it to the new salesman, who
goes the same shade as the scum but,
urged on by Shaggy, obediently drinks a
mugful and reckons it’s the best he’s ever
tasted. One thing leads to another, and
they sample many kinds of grapes, pea-
nuts, passionfruit, potatoes, the fine cream
Ferdy gets from the new separator, a
syide variety of new wines and, in less
variety but greater volume, some old,
matured wines. The new salesman wakes
up at his hotel next morning lying on his
bed fully dressed. Later he rings up
Shaggy to ascertain whether the com-
pleted and duly signed order for a com-
bine on account of Ferdy which he has
found in his bag is fair dinkum or not.
He learns he has made his first sale, and
on sober reflection reckons it’s a helluva
way to earn a living.

“Hanko”: Of the 115 species of snake
named in Australia “Bellerive” (B.
24/11 / ’4B) has 113 dead to rights in the
lines : “At sound to cover they glide out
of sight,” but even poetic licence won’t
get the veteran rhymster past the death-
adder or tiger-snake. The adder will
stay put if a double hunger is exploded
beside it, and more often than not the
tiger will stick around at sight and sound
of anything that moves. One of the most
timid of our venomous reptiles is the
black snake, and there’s not a scrap of
yiciousness in the whole slim length of
it. The venom of the black is only one-
75th the strength of an equal quantity
of tiger venom, and its fangs are grooved
shallower. Therefore, and contrary to
popular belief, the red-bellied one is least
dangerous of venomous snakes. Because
its fangs are hollow and twice the length
of those of the tiger-snake, the death-
adder is deadliest of Australian reptiles.
But the tiger is the most dangerous. It
is active, widely-distributed, easily pro-
voked and its venom is 2\ times more
potent than that of the death-adder.

“Blime”: Was short-cutting through
Bob O’Malley’s back paddock when T
spotted a figure pottering around, and
presently recognised Dill Peters. As I
pulled up Dill finished scooping a minia-
ture trench about a foot long and a few
inches deep in the dusty soil, eyed the re-
sult, nodded and moved on to start
scratching again. After several more
holes that threatened to sift in again any
minute my curiosity broke loose.
“What’re you doing, Dill?” “Catchin’
rabbits, o’ course,” he replied. “Getting
many?” I inquired. He looked at me
pityingly. “Aw, don’t be mad. I ain’t
got none yet, but” A rabbit jumped
up near his feet and he stopped to bellow
an invitation to the rodent to stick around
and be in the party. “Bob O’Malley’s give
me this paddick t’ trap next winter,” he
explained. “Bob’s lucky to get .you,” I
grinned. “Nobody’s ever done any good
yet trapping in here.” “No, an’ good
reason why.” Dill came over and leaned
on the nag’s neck confidentially. “It’s
’cos the ground gets froze ’ard here in the
winter, an’ they can’t set their traps,” he
almost whispered. “Don’t y’ see, that’s
why I’m makin’ all me sets in mid-
summer, t’ have ’em ready.”
* * * *
“Narrin”: While we’re invading the
privacy of lizards (B. 17/11 /’4B) a trick
of the little painted-dragon is worth
mention. I let a couple of the small rep-
tiles go around the house recently, and
was lucky enough to see them house-
hunting outside the living-room window
a while later. They flickered out from
the shelter of the brush fence on to a
sun-washed sandy patch, and one lizard
immediately began to excavate an air-
raid shelter, alternating spells of furious
digging with periods of wary immobility.
The other climbed to the three-quarter-
inch eminence of a piece of board and
“When you call me that again , smile!”
began a survey of the scenery. Rearing
up, he propped himself erect like a tiny
old-man too on his long tail, with the
difference that his hindlegs, instead of
being gathered beneath him in the mar-
supial fashion, were straightened out and
thrust forward, making a tripod with the
tail. The long feet were turned slightly
outward. The neck was craned upwards,
“The ice lasts twice as long since We got the refrigerator , John."
giving an odd peering effect to the head,
which from time to time turned from
side to side. The little chap maintained
the pose for at least five minutes, giving
the family time to collect as an audience.
Later both digger and sentinel vanished
beneath a scrap of dead buckbush, pre-
sumably to discuss the culpability of the
Government in the matter of housing
shortages.

“Übet”: Sam caught sight of the men
erecting sheep-yards not far from the
road and turned in to inquire the way.
The younger of the blokes pulled out the
makings and turned towards him. “No,
y’ can’t go wrong,” he assured Sam. “Got
a match?” He propped himself against
a post, casting an eye towards the older
bloke. “Y’ll have t’ step on it, Charlie,”
he called, “or we won’t get done in time.
Got t’ watch ’im,” he added to Sam, “f
see he keeps goin’. Not that I’d care,
only I want t’ finish these yards t’morrer
night. Like t’ get away down-country the
next day.” Sam contributed a nod and
mentioned the weather. Ten minutes
later the yard-builder squinted again
down the job. “What’s Charlie up t’
now?” he muttered. “C’n you see from
there? Gripes, he’ll know it if we don’t
finish t’morrer,” “Well, he seems steady
enough,” Sam remarked. “Why not go
down-country if you want to and leave
him to finish on his own?” “Yair, I
would,” scowled the other, “but y’ see I
was a bit of a mug. I went an’ signed-
on to work for him till these yards were
completed.”

“Bo”: With the long drought continu-
ing, Bartlett’s house-tanks, down to the
last few rungs, were strictly reserved for
drinking purposes. The well was almost
dry, and even the creek which ran through
the bottom of the property, always the
last to give out, was causing anxiety.
Mum Bartlett was due to do the washing,
so the new hand from the city was given
the job of taking the dray and filling
the 44gal. drum with the creek water.
Bartlett took the opportunity of giving
the youth a badly-needed lesson in har-
nessing-up Skipper, and when the drum
was on board he issued final instructions
about covering the full drum tautly with
bags to prevent spilling on the way back
and then slapped Skipper on the rump to
start him off. Almost an hour later Mum
Bartlett’s impatience at the inordinate
delay in returning gave out, and Bartlett
cursefully strode down to the creek where
it widened before turning into Blake’s
property. The dray was in the middle
of the creek; the hand was standing up
holding the reins and saying “Worb’ck,
Skipper, worb’ck!” upon which the
puzzled horse would back a few more
inches toward the opposite bank. “What
d’ y’ want him to back for, y’ goat!”
roared Bartlett. “Y’ want to come for-
ward. Giddap, Skipper!” As the horse
moved forward a wondering smile came
over the hand’s face. “Gripes!” he said.
“Thanks, boss. That’s the word I’ve been
trying to think of!”

“Young ’Un”: Sense of direction in
horses and the old bushman’s knack of
reading tracks appear to me to run along
the one line. Was boundary-riding on
Clonagh station in n.-w. Queensland and
old Jim Jones, in charge of our small
outstation, directed me to ride the
northern fence, thence along the western
fence for four miles till I reached the
dam, taking for my direction home from
there a very scattered line of timber. A
few chains after leaving the dam many
horse-tracks were visible going to the
right of my course, and, thinking they be-
longed to old Jim’s horses, I followed
them, much to the annoyance of my old
mare, who fought against my judgment.
I was soon lost, but managed to reach the
outstation, mentioning nothing to old Jim
of the erratic course I took. My claims
to bushmanship were shattered the fol-
lowing week when Jim wanted to know
what I was doing along Sullivan’s fence
last time I was out that way. My mare
gave the show away by the huge saucer-
shaped track she left on the barren plain.

“B. A. Ker”: It was in the days when
a really good pea-picker could knock out
a hard living, and a poor one got little
more for his pains than backache pills.
The driver of the old service-car pointed
to a figure in the dust-cloud ahead.
“That’s old Fred the pea-picker,” he said ;
“he never fails to turn up just as the
Valley crops are ready.” Half-way up a
long, steep grade the driver stopped be-
side the figure that, laden like a Christmas-
tree, toiled in slow progress on an old and
heavy bike. “Chuck her on the trailer and
hop in here with us,” was the hearty in-
vitation. It was promptly and gratefully
accepted. Several miles passed with very
little conversation from the little grey-
moustached pea-picker ; then he volun-
teered ; “You know, I’m thinking about
buying a motor-bike; and I reckon it’ll
pay me.” I agreed that it should, with
the saving of time in moving from place
to place. “No, it’s not that,” he cor-
rected mildly; “but I figure it out like
this: Riding is hot work and it’s thirsty
work. Naturally a hot, thirsty man won’t
pass a pub. And one drink is no good to
a man with a real thirst; he’d have to
have three or more. Well, with that
money a bloke could buy a gallon of
petrol; he could ride in comfort, he
wouldn’t get hot, and therefore he
wouldn’t want to stop at every wayside
pub.” Two years later I met him again—
still pedalling the Same old bike. “You
haven’t bought the motor-bike yet?” I
asked. “No.” His reply was decisive.
“I thought it over and I realised that I’d
been looking at it the wrong way: I was
thinking that I could buy petrol with the
money I would otherwise waste on beer.
That was the wrong outlook. I can see
now that I can buy beer with the money
I would otherwise waste on petrol. Then,
too, a man’s got to have some pleasure in
life. And what fun would I get out of
riding into a township just for the thrill
of seeing a mechanic pour my hard-
earned brass into a petrol-tank?”

“Bon-yi”: On the navigation charts of
Magnetic Island (Q.) officialdom recog-
nises a birds’ nest —a large rock that
stands out very prominently is marked
“Eagle’s Nest Rock.” It is the nesting-
site of the white-breasted sea eagles, and
the huge mound of sticks and driftwood
on the top of the great barren rock stands
out clearly. The top of the rock is
white with guano, and the nesting-site
has been in constant use as long as the
oldest resident can remember. Lonely,
isolated Balding Bay, on the north-east tip
of the island, faces the open ocean, and
the big sea-scavengers must have solved
the problem of anchoring their heap of
driftwood against the hurricane blasts of
the cyclone season on the top of the
smooth-worn granite.

“South Land”: “Mac Hoots” in his
comment on the action of the Forestry
Advisory Council (B. 22/9/’4B) is advised
to turn his attention from witchbumers to
witch(etty)-hunters, for this is what he’ll
find on page 35 of H. A. Lindsay’s
“Bushman’s Handbook”:
Witchetty grubs brought a bit of trouble
on my head, admits the author. He
showed the Yanks how to find them and
they voted them as good as anything they
had ever eaten, but a few days later com-
plaints began to pour in from the land-
owners whose properties lay around the
American camp. Armed with tomahawks
and machets, the Yanks were cutting down
all the wattle-trees in the area to gel the
grubs and, naturally, the farmers were
objecting.
Were the Americans alluded to lost in
the bush? Did not their instruction and
inspiration lead to wanton destruction and
despoliation of the bushland? MacH.
should realise that witchetty-happy
warriors can, in one hour of madness,
lay waste the silent harvest of centuries!

“D.R.H.”: I found Winnie-the-Wedge-
tail with a foot in one trap and a wing-
tip in another, and, after releasing her,
carried her home. There my honest in-
tention of investigating the flight median-
isms of eagles was frustrated by the ad-
miration of the family and by my own
feeling for the fearlessness of the great
bird. So Winnie was tethered by the
leg in shelter, fed and watered. For five
or six days she greeted all-comers in the
same way: a haughty stare from the
great, deep-set eyes, the fine head with
its slashing beak held high. She made
no hostile demonstration and, obviously,
expected none. But in all those days she
ate nothing. However, at the end of that
time a rabbit, given to her in the morn-
ing, was reduced to neatly turned-back
skin, picked bones and polished skull by
evening. The next morning she craned
forward eagerly to see if I had food for
her. In the two or three weeks since
then she has eaten heartily—in fact, she
displays emotion only at the appearance
of food. At other times she sits com-
posedly, but not at all dejectedly, on her
perch and gazes at one with that time-
less stare common to many birds and to
all reptiles. If approached as closely as
two or three feet she may attempt to
flap away, but, like a horse, she calms
down at a sharp word. When it is neces-
sary to take her water-tin from under
her feet she never attempts reprisals, but
she may flap to the end of her tether,
where she casts herself down on her breast,
wings spread wide on the ground, and
quite obviously sulks. With true rep-
tilian patience, she’ll maintain this pose
as* long as she believes anyone to be
near. In another week or two we hope
She’ll sail once more over the dead-
finish creeks in company of her mate,
with captivity only food for reminis-
cences.

“Moujik”: Tell “Rawhiti” that the
yarn about wheat germinating after lying
4000 years in an Egyptian tomb is so
much hooey, based on tales told by
Egyptian fellaheen. Samples of wheat
genuinely found by archaeologists them-
selves, as in Tutankhamen’s tomb, proved
“You must have picked up a germ somewhere."
on being tested, both in London’s Ken-
sington Gardens and in actual Nile loam,
to be dead. Wheat grown by the
Pharaohs was a variety heavily bearded
almost like barley, apparently not long
derived from wild wheat. Such wild
wheat, known colloquially as Pharaoh’s
wheat, still grows along the Nile : so it
was a simple matter for the tricksters
to gather some seed, and then by a little
sleight-of-hand produce it from a sealed
jar found m the tomb of, say, Rameses
111.

“Zake”: The Higher Education having
been with us now long enough for the
modern cocky to have acquired the art
of gauging the weight of his haystacks, I
would have presumed that he would do it
the scientific way. I have yet to hear
of one who does. The insurance agent
usually makes his calculations, and Ive
been told of a celebrated one who has
even got within 10 p.c. of being correct.
Yet it is amazing how a big stack can be
gauged by the man who builds it to
within a hundredweight or two. Equally
amazing is that the man who can get so
close to the weight of his own is so often
out to blazes in his calculations of an-
other man’s stack. Pbssibly the differ-
ence in quality and the method of cutting
and saving add up to the disparity in
weight of two similar-sized stacks. As
in the case of the cattleman who can
get to within a few pounds of a beast’s
weight, so the cocky can get close to a
prediction of his stack’s contents —by
long experience.

“Mat’s Mate”: I found the big fellow
doubled up and groaning, and in a per-
spiration borrowed the boss’s utility and
ran him in to the nearest doctor.
“Appendix,” snaps the doc. and bungs
Mat into the hospital. It’s about dark
by then and I’m hangin’ round outside
when the matron discovers me an’ says,
“Oh, you needn’t wait. Your friend will
be all right.” “I’m waitin’,” I says.
She looks at me an’ goes inside. Nothin’
happens for a couple o’ hours, then a
young nurse comes out with some tea
and biscuits an’ says, “It’s all over, young
man. Your friend ,is sleeping. Come
an’ see him in the mornin’.” So I thank
her an’ blow. Next mornin’ I’m up at
the hospital an’ there he is, white an’ a
bit shaken. The young nurse takes me
to him an’ blows off. “She’s a decent
sort,” I says, thinkin’ o’ that cup o’ tea.
Mat says, in a whisper, “Know what she
done? Come in here this mornin’ an’
gimme a wash. Then she brings in one
o’ them ’namel basins an’ in it there’s a
white thing like a jelly-bean. ‘That’s
what caused the trouble,’ she says. ‘That’s
your ’pendix.’ ” He dropped his eyes and
went red. “Cripes,” he whispers.
“Wouldn’t y’ think they’d let some bloke
do that? It don’t look right, havin’ a
girl show a man a bit of his inside like
that.”

“Telarb” (T.S.): Contrary to the im-
pression that seems to be shared by
Martin-place and Flinders-street travellers,
there are no “chiefs” here in Torres
Straits. Originally mamooses, these
gentlemen rose to Chief Councillors and
finally to Chairmen —positions they hold
generally with distinction. Also kava is
not a Torres Straits drink. Tuba is the
word. Kava is made from a plant which
doesn’t grow here. Tuba is from the
coconut, but, as the Lord Bishop frowns
upon the brew, the natives don’t drink it
publicly, nor, most definitely, would they
offer it to whites —Torres Straits islanders
have an acute sense of the fitness of
things. And “boongs” is regarded—and
rightly—by them as a derogatory term.

“Caltex”: The mailman and I arrived
in time to intervene in a fierce argument
between Ned and Josh. Josh had given
Ned the job of clearing a small block
heavily timbered with ironwood and
ironbark. The price agreed upon—£lo
an acre —seemed fair enough, but when,
at the end of a fortnight of hard work,
they measured it up, it made only an acre.
Josh wanted then to pay Ned eight
pounds a week for his labor, but Ned was
insistent that the contract be observed
and would accept no more. “But, I
said, scanning the block, “there’s more
than an acre there.” “That’s what we
thought,” Ned replied. “But the chain
measure says six chains by five. Ten
be one is an acre, so four off the five and
added to six gives you ten be one, which
is an acre.” Josh, the second-worst
mathematician in Australia, nodded agree-
ment, and it took the mailman and I an
hour to make three acres where one had
been before.
* * * ♦
“Orto”: The recent discovery in New
Zealand of a pair of live birds of a
species for many years thought to have
been extinct raises the hopes of local
ornithologists regarding some of our
similarly-placed Australian birds. As this
bird has for so long escaped observation
in the smaller area of M.L. one would
reasonably expect that in our vast spaces
there is every prospect of rediscovering
some of our own lost races of birds. Cer-
tainly the conditions are not identical,
more than three-quarters of our continent
being of a single type of habitat, an
entirely “desert-fauna” area, showing few
racial differences in birds found anywhere
between Broome and the Victorian
Mallee, s.-w. Queensland and Coolgardie.
Any species found within this vast area
would, if threatened with extinction from
natural causes or introduced enemies,
suffer the same disabilities throughout the
entire area. Our remaining space, com-
posed of & variety of habitats ranging from
semi-arid and open eucalypt-savannah to
dense tropical rain-forest, is not much
in excess of the total area of our sister-
Dominion. There are, however, several
isolated areas, principally around our
coastal belt, which are surrounded by
the drier eucalypt-savannah type of
country and which have developed a
fauna of their own, some races of which
are strictly confined to these small
“island-type” habitats. It is probable that
in such areas we may rediscover, in
reasonable numbers, some of the birds at
present thought to be extinct or very
nearly so.
**** . . .
“Old-timer”: The sun was sinking
behind the pine ridge and sending shafts
of ruddy light across the slope where the
sheep drifted down to the flat and the
little creek among the saplings and native
willow. High on the slope Pocketkmte
lazily lit his pipe, easing the brown horse
off to the right with his knee, content to
see that the curve of sheep kept flowing
down to the water. Away below> and
parallel with him. Little Curl was walk-
ing along the broken fence, bridle-reins
over his arm, his horse stepping slowly,
his dog just ahead keeping the sheep
from breaking through the flood gaps m
the fence. Ahead, on the creek, the
boss had dismounted and was leaning
against his horse, watching the leaders
drink and lead off on to the slope where
we meant them to camp. Old Paddy
drove the wagonette wide of the tail
and headed for a spot where two swamp-
gums made an inviting spot for a cook
to dump his gear and get his fire going.
The sun was gone now, and, as the tail
of the mob pushed into the water, the
shafts of light through the pines diffused
and faded and deep shadows began to
spread. The sheep had travelled 12 miles,
and we knew they wouldn’t shift far
that night. The dogs headed for the
water and wallowed and drank, and it was
strange to see how they and the sheep
shared the water, almost fraternally,
though they’d been enemies all day; as
though they knew the day was done and
the game over for the time being. Along
the creek magpies farewelled the sun with
a rich chorus and the inevitable willie-
wagtail was already darting and dodging'
about Paddy, talking to him and scolding
an inquisitive minah. Animals and men
were quiet with that pleasant, warm tired-
ness of the day’s end, and Paddy’s fire
was glowing in the dusk, the odors of
stew mingling with the smell of water
on dust and the warm evening fragrance
of the creek. That’s all. Such is the
nostalgia for days that are gone.
THE ’NINETY FLOOD.
Who can remember the ’Ninety Flood
When the Darling King came down,
Riding the bends, and out for blood,
On his bridleless horse of brown;
When close on his heels his squadron pressed
To hack him with power and might,
And galloping hooves that broke our rest
In the calm of the warm bush night?
I remember the road to the ridges
When the waters spread girth-deep
From the river-gums to the sandhill gidyeas
Where we gathered the helpless sheep.
I remember the weary thrashing
Over the blacksoil plains
With the flood on our kneepads splashing
And the mud on our dangling reins.
We saw the teal spring swift from cover
In the swamp where the lignums lie,
And we heard the black duck whistling over
As he climbed to the open sky;
And under that cloudless ceiling
In a playground shared by none
How the grey galahs went wheeling
All silver-and-rose in the sun!
I remember the Warrego tossing
With the wrack of the plains afloat,
And the Wait at the station crossing
Till the horse-boy brought the boat,
And we launched in the whirling torrent
And we turned our horses free
To face the threat of the current
And the chance of a drifting tree.
Ah, well! They were brave days yonder;
There were comrades tried and true;
And often I dream and ponder
How we saw the Great Flood through.
’Tis a challenge will ring for ever
In the ears of the Border men,
But I doubt if the Darling River
Will be ever so wild again.

"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
A New Sheep Disease.
“Bungaree”; In certain dis-
tricts lambs have not responded
to drenching, even with pheno-
thiazine, the most efficient sheep-
drench, and which stops the
widest range of internal para-
sites. Post-mortems have re-
vealed that death was due to
coccidia, confirmed by examina-
tion of droppings.
Symptoms are very similar to
those of black-scour worm. The
chief point of difference is that
coccidiosis attacks sheep at an
earlier age than worm parasites,
and may kill lambs a few weeks
old. Scouring is nearly always
present and is accompanied by
rapid loss of condition, listless-
ness and a poddied appearance.
Deathrate is high.
Black-scour worms'are very
hard to recognise, but they are
to be found in the first 10ft. to
15ft. of the runners just below
the fourth stomach. Coccidia
will be revealed by the state
of the opposite end of the
runners, where they join the
blind gut. They live in the wall
of the intestine there, causing a
thickening that is easily felt by
handling, and there may be a
number of small pimply growths.
The parasites lay eggs at an
astronomical rate, hence under
optimum seasonal conditions in-
fection may be extremely rapid.
So far most reports of the
disease have come from the
colder, high altitudes with a
regular rainfall, but so little is as
yet known of the disease that it
may be widespread over other
regions and several States.
The only reliable treatment so
far discovered is the use of one
of the sulfa drugs. Unfortun-
ately, sulphamezathine, which is
the most suitable, is also fairly
costly, working out at approxi-
mately 6d. per dose for a 201 b,
lamb. However, at present sheep
values it is well worth while, as
even though the lamb recovers
without treatment it will remain
stunted in growth, and its con-
stitution will be affected per-
manently. Sulphamezathine is
available in tablets or liquid
form. The dose is two tablets
(of 0.5 grammes each) per 201 b.
liveweight of the animal to be
treated, or 6 c.c. of sulphameza-
thine 16 per cent, solution.
Tablets should be crushed to a
powder, shaken up with water in
a small bottle and administered
as a drench. The solution may
be administered by a drenching
syringe calibrated in c.cs. The
ordinary drenching-gun of 1 fl.
oz. or greater capacity cannot
be relied on to give such small
doses accurately. The dose
should be administered daily for
three consecutive days.
F.A.Q. and Grading.
“Me-Ne”: N.S.W. wheat-
growers are far from unanimous
that f.a.q. should be abolished
and a grading system introduced,
as advocated by the retired
W.A. Agriculture Director, Dr.
Sutton, who urged that a special
classification of strong wheats in
the northern and western divi-
sions of the N.S.W. wheat-belt
be made during the current har-
vest. Sutton claimed this as a
practical plan that could be
operated under present silo re-
ceiving methods.
Few wheatgrowers quarrel
with the principle, but many
differ as to the methods to be
adopted, holding that f.a.q. is a
misnomer because it deals with
weight rather than quality.
Growers of that opinion say
N.S.W. wheats should be divided
into two main classifications:
(1) hard or strong wheats, (2)
soft or w’eak wheats.
A strong wheat is one strong
in gluten or protein quality,
while a weak wheat is one in
which starch predominates. This
simple grading could easily be
determined by any receiver as
the wheat was brought in. When
the grain of a hard wheat is cut
horizontally with a sharp knife
it has a clean, bright-yellow,
vitreous or “horny” appearance.
A soft wheat-grain has a
whitish, floury look.
When, and if, the division is
made the strong wheats would
provide the baking flours, seed
wheat and export wheat for
human consumption. Soft
wheats would furnish biscuit-
flour and stock feed.
\ ,
Transport of Cattle.
“Outback”: Despite the pub-
licity given to road - trains,
Queensland cattlemen can never
have security until the Blackall-
Charleville rail-link is built. In
the far outback and N.T. there
is a wide field for the use of
road-trains; and if they could
be used in conjunction with a
link-up of the central and
southern railway systems in
Queensland the industry would
always be able to get fats to
market and have quick trans-
port for stock when drought
threatened. When one thinks of
the millions spent on social ser-
vices and so forth one cannot
understand why a Government
refuses to spend £2 to £3 mil-
lion on a rail-link which would
save millions in drought losses
alone.
The transport by road-train
of cows and “tinners” from the
N.T. to the Adelaide market
proved uneconomic, but good-
quality ox-beef, which realises
a much higher price in Adelaide,
is considered likely to pay as
cargo for road-trains, even over
distances up to 500 miles by
road.
In view of the lower rail
freights on Queensland railways
connecting the far west and
north-west with coastal meat-
works, the Australian Meat
Board considers that road-train
transport to the railheads at
Dajarra or Mt. Isa (where suit-
able yards for the unloading of
road-trains are to be con-
structed) may be an economic
proposition at export prices, and
the board will conduct experi-
ments as soon as practicable. As
the board has been given cer-»
“Here she comes, Dad!”
tain special conditions in its
trials, it is urging the industry to
await a final decision on the
economic success of road-train
transport until it issues a full
report.
Creosoting Timber.
“Ognop”: Does the creosoting
of fence-posts afford pro-
tection against white-ants (B.
13/10/’48)? The method ap-
pears to be efficient, but from
actual experience I believe it is
a waste of time. I remodelled
an old creosote boiling plant
which had been used for impreg-
nating hardwood insulator-pins
for telegraph-poles. Pins were
placed in a wire-mesh container,
lowered into boiling creosote and
left there for eight hours. In
dismantling the plant we found
two pins that had fallen from
the basket and undoubtedly had
been immersed for perhaps
months or years. Curious to dis-
cover how far the creosote had
penetrated, we split the pins.
The creosote had not pene-
trated beyond one-thirty-second
of an inch, even at the ends. To
find out how long the creosote
would take to evaporate from
the wood the pins were placed
out in the weather, and within
two weeks the creosote had dis-
appeared.
My Dad, who was an archi-
tect, always used butcher’s
brine as a white-ant deterrent,
and I’ve never known termites
to come within yards of it.
Rearing Orphan Pups.
“Breeder”: It may help
“Urana” (B. 20/10/’4B) and
others faced with the worry and
risk of losing motherless pedi-
greed pups, when feeding them
on cow’s milk, to know that in
dog-world-language reduced milk
is not cow’s milk reduced in
strength. On the contrary it is
ordinary fresh milk which has
been left in a pan to simmer
very slowly until it has been re-
duced to a third of its original
quantity. By this means its
superfluous water content has
been evaporated. The more
nourishing constituents left will
be about the consistency of thin
cream and of about the same
quality as bitch’s milk, which is
approximately three to four
times the strength of ordinary
cow’s milk.
Those able to get cream could
add some to ordinary cow’s
milk, but as the pups will die on
too much strength, as well as on
too little, it is hard to know how
much cream to add. As valuable
pups may be lost while experi-
menting it is safer to rely on
reducing by evaporation.
Townsville Lucerne.
“Bon-Yi”: The trial plots of
Townsville lucerne at Rodd’s
Bay, on Mr. Shaw’s property,
appear to be promising. It
should grow very well on that
country, as excellent samples
were growing along the railway
close to Benaraby, about six
miles on the Gladstone side, as
far back as 1939.
The seeds evidently were
brought from the north by cow-
manure falling out of wagons.
It spread from the railway into
adjacent paddocks on poor stony
soil.
To collect seed, find where the
plant has been growing thickly.
Carefully sweep up the loose
surface soil under the dead mat
of the plants and screen it
through a fine-mesh wire-screen.
The tiny hooks on the end of
the seeds catch on the mesh, and
if the screen is reversed a mass
of the seeds will be found.
After Hatching.
“J.J.A.”; 'As soon as the last
chicken is out of the incubator
and the brooder-house it is
time to get on to the odd jobs.
Scrub out incubators and
brooders, making sure all venti-
lation passages are open. Clean
out the flues. Look to all work-
ing parts and, if necessary, oil
or clean with kerosene. Nuts,
bolts and screws frequently
need tightening. Hinges on
doors and chicken-runs may
need replacing or repairing. The
wire-netting trays on the bot-
tom of the brooders may be
broken. If you have no trays,
now is the time to make a
couple of sets. Two per
brooder is necessary. Disinfect
everything. A coat of paint or
varnish helps to preserve both
wood- and iron-work.
If you have kerosene-lamps,
clean them. Look to the wicks
and replace if not long enough.
Order next season’s kerosene.
Replace broken thermometers.
All thermometers will need to
be checked before use next sea-
son. Boil all drinking-troughs,
.-fountains and feed-troughs. Go
over them with a soldering-
iron. If you did not have
enough this season make or buy
more, A few spare ones will be
handy. If the chicken-runs were
not satisfactory make the altera-
tions now. Make all improve-
ments noticed as necessary
during the past season ; other-
wise they will never be made.
Get a bag of rice-hulls for
next season. The local grocer
buys his sauce packed in them
and generally burns them.
Lastly disinfect the whole place
and close up until the beginning
of the next season. Then make
a final check.
Caprock Son ghum.
“Chappie”; A trial of the
American variety of grain sorg-
hum known as Caprock by
H. C. M. Sharp, of Millmerran
(Q.), indicates that this variety
will become very popular in
Queensland. Sharp planted 151 b.
on two acres in rows 14 inches
apart. The seed did not get a
fair go, as the plot had been a
dense bed of couch grass which
was ploughed out with a disc-
plough but could not be de-
stroyed completely before plant-
ing-time. Only about 30 per
cent, of the grain germinated,
and swamp couch germinated
freely in the young crop,

threatening to choke it. In spite
of this, however, the crop was
harvested on the 127th day
above ground, the yield being 26
bags of first-class and two of
second-class grain. The crop
also received too much rain, but
no smut appeared, and the plants
stocked well, many having up to
six large heads. Stalks carried
only 11 leaves as against 15 for
Wheatland and 12 for Kalo;
average height at harvest was
3ft. 6in. to 4ft.
The only seed to leave the
Millmerran district went to the
Queensland and N.S.W, Depart-
ments of Agriculture and to
Ceylon. W. D. Kerle, N.S.W.
Dept, of Agriculture, reports this
variety as having yielded 111.8
bushels per acre under irrigation
at the Leeton experimental farm.
Stencil-cutting.
“Helldud”; Those hints (B.
10/11 /’4B) are helpful and clear,
but why go to all that trouble?
The best, most arresting, easiest-
made and cheapest stencil is the
spot variety.
In spot stencils letters, marks,
etc., are outlined by a series of
spots. Needed for the job is a
wad-cutter of required diameter,
a hammer, a block of hardwood
with its end grain square, a
sheet of coarse emery-cloth and
a piece of galvanised iron.
Outline your stencil, and at
iin, or wider intervals cut round
holes in the iron with the wad-
cutter, the iron seated on the end
grain of the hardwood block.
When piercing is completed
hammer the undersides of the
holes flush on the wood block.
Finish by rubbing smooth with
emery-cloth.
Making a spot stencil entails
only a quarter of the time taken
to cut an old-time stencil. There
are no ties to worry about and
the result is a 100 p.c. more-
easily-read sign.
Hints for the Farm.
“Billjim”; Bale meadow and
oaten hay as soon as it is dry
enough to press, so avoiding ex-
cessive fermentation. To test
when hay is safe to bale take a
big handful from the centre of
some of the stocks or windrows
and twist each as if wringing
water from a cloth. If no
moisture exudes it can be baled.
“E.H.S.”: It is not generally
known that a few leaves of
cactus macerated in a cask of
muddy water will precipitate the
clay and other impurities held in
suspension. The bush custom of
using lime to clarify muddy
water is all right as far as clari-
fication is concerned, but it tends
to increase any hardness already
existing in the water. Cactus
has a marked effect in softening
hard water.
“Plane Creek”: When feeding
pigs don’t put too much reliance
on grains which, though rich in
carbohydrates, are a poor source
of protein. Protein is present in
milk, meatmeal, peanuts and
green grass or lucerne. It builds
up flesh, whilst carbohydrates
form fats. However the neces-
sary protein in the pig’s ration
is supplied, the animals should
also have access to green-feed.
“W. Court”: To destroy
white-ants before they can
migrate to buildings, knock some
holes in their bush beds and in-
sert pine-boards that have been
steeped in strong arsenic pent-
oxide solution for several hours.
Coming to repair the damage,
some of the white-ants will
attack the soft boards and be
poisoned, after which canni-
balism will set in, and the whole
colony will perish.
“Bill C.”: Geese won’t thrive
without good grassland with
ponds to roam in (B. 17/11 /’4B).
Two to three geese to one gander
is right, and the birds should be
mature before any attempt is
made to breed from them. The
gander should be three years old
or more. The young birds
should .be sold, not used for
breeding purposes. The same
two or three birds can be bred
from for a good many years.
“Ben Acre”: Sheep that have
been without food and water for
long should be handled carefully.
Don’t bustle or drive them. Be
mean with water, but give feed
—before water always, if they
will take it. If they go down
after too much water, get
cramped, lie about panting and
are overheated, allow them to
lie quietly in the shade till the
panting stops. Then encourage
them to their feet. Once they
can get up alone, leave them to
feed.
“M.”: Use only fresh beans
for salting. Put them in a crock
with salt, layer for layer, until
the jar is full, finishing with a
final layer of salt from which
no beans are protruding. About
lib. of salt is needed for every
31b. or 41b. of beans, but if
more salt is needed don’t skimp
it, or the whole will go mouldy.
Cover with greaseproof paper
or cellophane; Before using the
beans for cooking soak them in
several changes of water.
“He-Ne”: Flag - smut has
shown up badly in the sup-
posedly resistant Gabo wheat in
parts of N.S.W. this season. It
is worrying growers, owing to
the current popularity of Gabo.
Flag - smut seriously reduces
yields, and one susceptible
variety, Canberra, sometimes
had its potential yield halved by
flag-smut. Gabo is a Bobin-
Bobin-Gaza cross and was bred
by Dr. Waterhouse, of Sydney
University. While it has yielded
well this year its grain is often
pinched and unattractive, but
rich in gluten content.

up the Bible and went and looked
thoughtfully at Peter. She had
a hazy idea of waking him up
and making him pray with her
for help. But she suddenly
changed her mind, lifted the
Bible and hit the little boy over
the head with it.
Peter sprang up and began to
scream. She took him by the
shoulders. “Shut .up! It was
only the Bible I hit you with, so
it couldn’t have hurt. Listen,
you are to go home now. You
must run all the way! Tell them
that Gugga has his boat out and
is going to Norway. Do you
hear? Run all the way. Tell
them to hurry!”
“Ai-ee! Aue-ee! Poll-ee! I
couldn’t! I can’t. Not all that
way, in the dark, alone! Don’t
make me, you come with me,
please, Polly, please! ”
“Listen, if you don’t go at
once and run all the way and tell
Dad and James to come, I’ll
throw you over Te Reinga. Do
you hear! Into the cave full of
bones you’ll go and be nibbled
by devils with hot teeth. Go
now, run all the way! I mean it
about Te Reinga. I know a
short-cut. I’ll get a devil to
help me —he’ll hold you by one
ear and I’ll hold you by the other
—and we’ll swing you over!”
\ A / ITH a sob and a snarl the
“* little boy darted outside.
Gugga saw him as he sped up
the track, but he was too busy
gathering his treasures to bother
about Peter. Polly helped him,
taking a long time over folding
things, pretending to mislay tins
of hooks and nails, making un-
necessary fuss about parcels of
biscuits, tea and sardines. She
calculated that it would take
Peter about half an hour to get
home —she thought it would
take the men fifteen minutes to
reach the cottage.
Backwards and forwards went
the old man carrying his pack-
ages. Once he was gone for a
long time, and Polly went
cautiously down to the rocks.
There was a lantern at the mast-
head now and one at each end
of the boat —but beyond their
pale light she could see no more
than the next wave rolling out
of the darkness. At last he
looked up.
“Is that you, Helen? Come,
lass, I’m ready, all is done.”
“Gugga, wait awhile. Taihoa,
Gugga! You have forgotten
the wax fruit.”
“Let it be. It is nothing,
Helen, nothing. There will be
many better things in Old Nor-
way. Come, Helen.”
“But, Gugga, you cannot go
yet. You must take your old
chair and your two potato-
plants.” i
“Helen Browne, I am ready.
You must step in now. See,
already I am leaving. Jump,
Helen, jump.”
“Oh, Gugga!” Polly tried to
grasp the rope and hold back
the boat, but it slid from her cold
fingers and she turned and clung
to the rocks. Peter had been
gone for hours —why did no-
body come! Gugga was going
—there was only a few yards of
water between them, but already
that was as much as a whole
sea. -
THE photographer was play-
ing poker with Peter’s father
and mother and uncle when the
boy burst into the house.
“Hullo, what’s up!”
“It’s Polly,” he blubbered.
“Polly is going to throw me
over Te Reinga. Polly is going
to throw me to devils with hot
teeth. Polly hit me on the head
with Gugga’s Bible!”
“That Polly! She behaves
worse than a savage! ” and
Peter’s father lifted him on to
the table. “She will have to go
and stay with your sister, she
must be taught to be less wild! ”
His wife bridled. “The school-
teacher told me she is a clever
girl, Polly. Very bright for her
age is what I was told by one
who ought to know. And
didn’t she bring home the book
of poetry for the way she said
her piece to the inspector?
Hush you, Peter, here is bread
and treacle, and tea to drink.”
Peter still snuffled, but he
drank the tea, making irritating
noises as he swallowed. The
photographer privately thought
him pigeon-livered, and resented
the way he rubbed his sticky
fingers on the cards.
“Polly speaks excellent Eng-
lish,” he said. “But, then, I’ve
noticed that most young Maoris
do, that is, when you can get
them to talk. I expect it’s be-
cause they are bilingual. I mean
they sound all their vowels,
never drop their g’s or say
‘ain’t’. But it’s a lonely place
here. I can’t think how you
can stand it, nothing to see or
do.”
“It’s our home,” said the
woman. “I have been many
times to the city. I am always
glad to be home.”
Peter ate another slice of bread
and treacle—he held it tilted to
one side, and great gobs of
treacle fell down his wrists on
to the table.
* I J SUPPOSE,” went on the
1 photographer, “that the
old man is all right?”
The woman spoke to the boy
in Maori. “Yes,” she smiled.
“He is speaking that his great-
grandfather is well and ate up
all his dinner.”
Peter, feeling free from the
everlastingly watchful Polly and
her “Don’t be silly, Peter!” be-
gan to wriggle on the table, and
finally got down and licked up
the spilt treacle, pretending to
be a pig gobbling in a trough.
“Can I have some peanuts?”
he asked his father.
“There are no peanuts. Now,
you just skip off to bed. Nice
time for a little boy to be up!”
Peter scuffled on the floor with
his bare feet. He had created
an impression when he first
arrived home —but now he felt
a certain coldness on the part of
the adults.
“Go on, do as you are told! ”
his mother said sharply, and he
went —but was back again
wrapped in a blanket, a few
minutes later. This time he
spoke to his uncle in Maori.
The three. Maoris burst out
laughing.
“He asks me,” Uncle James
told the photographer, “how
long would it take to get to Nor-
way in Gugga’s little boat. I
tell him never, that’s how long.”
“Why did you ask that?” The
photographer stared at the child.
“What do you know about Nor-
way, Peter?”
“Gugga is going there, Gugga
has got his boat down. Polly
said to tell you to go at once,
all of you. Polly said you were
to hurry because Gugga is going
to Norway.”
THE two Maoris jumped to
their feet and rushed out of
the house, dragging on their oil-
, skins as they fan. The photo-
grapher followed them down the
track; something had happened
to interest him at last. It was
very dark, and he fell several
times, his feet caught by the
treacherous dodder. His teeth
began to ache, his eyes smarted
and his head felt as if it had
been scalped. When he reached
the cottage the two men and the
girl were standing on the rocks
looking out to §ea where a faint
light bobbed up and down.
“He’ll never come back, now.
We’ve called and called. He’s
gone for good. What did he
say, Polly?”
“He said Gamle Norge and
‘there’s no night there,’ and he
called me Helen.”
“We’d better get to the home-
stead and ask them to ring the
lighthouse—look, he’s gone!”
They could no longer see the
light—the boat had disappeared
round the cape. The wind-flung
foam drove faster than the
waves out where the Pacific and
Tasman met in boisterous greet-
ing.
“We go to see if anything can
be done,” said Polly’s father.
“There is nothing, but one must
do what one can. You will bring
• Polly home?”
THE photographer rubbed his
sore knees as he followed
her into Gugga’s cottage. She
fastened the windows and
gathered up the plates and
thermos-flask. She felt ex-
hausted—her mind sealed in a
steel envelope.
The photographer picked up
a card from the floor and read
aloud: “To Helen Browne from
Janet Shaw. Now, who the
dickens was Helen Browne?”
“I told you—she was my
great-grandmother.”
“And who was Janet Shaw?”
“She was a devil with hot
teeth.”
The photographer laughed.
“And what is in the bottle?”
“Norge wine,” said Polly, “I
wouldn’t drink any if I were you
—it makes you awfully sick.”
For a moment the photo-
grapher thought she looked like
a thin ghost with anxious hag-
gard eyes in a small pointed face.
He rattled the door handle
impatiently. “Give me the
basket, Polly, and let’s get out
of here.”

that man evolved from the

“The Opposition is threatening to
end the Parliamentary session with
a roasting of External Affairs Minister
Doc Evatt.” _ , „
—Sydney “Sunday Telegraph.
Ah! Little does Bert Evatt
guess
While getting U.N.O. in a mess
How lads at Canberra are look-
ing
Ahead to his remote return
And with what eagerness they
burn
To have a hot reception cooking.
Well, may the Fates accord
their wish
To furnish us a tasty dish.
For if by moving divers motions
The boys can make the Evatt
roast
No harm is done, or at the most
’Twill settle all his half-baked
notions.
D.H.E.
The Irresistible.
It was obvious from the light
scowl on the Red Fiihrer’s face
that he was vastly pleased.
The latest Five-year-plan had
gone even better than the Polit-
buro’s wildest expectations—it
had finished up only 4\ years
behind schedule.
As well, under the new Marx-
ist-Stalinist Law which had been
approved s by the Russian Corn-
“Two E's in ‘pedigree,' fathead!”
munist party, the Mendelian Law
had been officially abolished;
this would now allow the seeds
of all burrs, docks, fat-hen, milk-
weed, thistles, stinkwort, etc.,
growing within the sacred
boundaries of the U.S.S.R. to
germinate as oats or barley if
they felt like it instead of mono-
tonously popping up as exact
replicas of their respective parent
plants, as they had to do in the
debilitated Democracies which
still clung to the outmoded
theories of Mendel.
Another gratifying feature of
the improving Soviet way of life
was that a Secret Police check-
up had revealed that there were
now 190,000 wrist-watches in the
Union, this working out at one
in 1000 of the population, a
vastly higher proportion than in
effete capitalist countries. What
was particularly pleasing about
this was that before the Red
Army got into Berlin after its
single-handed victory over the
Germans the total number of
watches in Russia had been 1200.
This surely revealed the truly
remarkable strides that the Soviet
watchmaking industry must be
making.
An even better cause for grati-
fication had been” the wonderful
enthusiasm of the workers at a
rally in the great Red October
ball-and-chain factory after the
announcement from the German
capital by Marshal Lykawisky
of the great triumph of the
Communists in the Berlin elec-
tions. As only 10,000 secret
police were at the meeting the
spontaneous demonstration of
affection for their Flihrer which
ended the rally was very pleas-
ing.
To commemorate the great
victory Joe had issued an Order
of the Day granting an amnesty
to 100,000 political prisoners,
thus reducing the slave-labor
“pool” to a bare 18 millions. On
top of this, he had displayed that
clemency which was a feature
of his benign dictatorship by
reducing the sentences passed on
2000 prisoners found guilty of
harboring anti-Stalinist thoughts
from strangling to shooting
through the back of the head.
Above all, the startling suc-
cesses achieved by famous Soviet
scientists had been responsible
for the passing of the usual
heavy scowl from Joe’s face.
There had, for instance, been
the fruitful experiments in
hybridising of the great Pro-
fessor Nutoff, who had suc-
ceeded in crossing the bald-
headed eagle with the Caucasian
mountain goat. This had re-
sulted in the evolution of a half-
feathered, half-haired animal
which, haying two hind-claws,
was able to milk itself, thus sav-
ing collectivised labor. On top
of this, the front-paws would
allow it to leap agilely while on
the ground, and being winged it
would be able to fly from pas-
fure to pasture. It was the
evolving of a bald-headed goat
with a beard, however, that was
the fundamental cause of Com-
munist joy, as this would be a
living and fitting memorial and
tribute to the Soviet’s first
Messiah, Lenin.
There was also the great
scheme of Professor Boobovitch
to save steel by having only three
rails in place of the usual four
for two-track railway systems,
both up and down trains to use
the centre rail. When the pro-
fessor overcame the slight hitch
of what would happen when up
and down trains passed each
other —or tried to —the scheme
would become part of the 17th
Five-year-plan,
The Red Fiihrer —ever an ex-
emplar of Spartan simplicity
leaned back in his specially-
imported English plush swivel-
chair and began examining
the blueprint of the great
scheme of Professor Battsov
to alter the earth’s axis by
magnetic attraction and thus
make Murmansk a great banana-
growing district. Presently the
Fiihrer picked up a bell and rang
it.
His Foreign Minister
entered the holy of holies.
Molly took a quick glance
around and, not seeing the Chief
of the N.K.V.D., seemed to
breathe more easily.
“Get me Professor Battsov,”
began the Fiihrer. “I want
to” #
Molly’s flat face fell. “I was
just going to see you about him.
Comrade,” he said. “I found
on the treasonable swine’s desk a
copy of this smuggled-in
American magazine open at an
advertisement showing an electric
coffee-percolator. He thieved a
plane and we suspect he’s
escaped to the Western Zone in
Germany,”
Joe frowned. “Put a price
on his head,” he barked. Then
he idly picked up the magazine
and a dreamy look came into
his eye.
“An electric coffee-perco-
lator!” he said in a faraway
voice. “I wonder if it brews
good coffee!”

PRINCE OF WALES AND REPULSE
Tineir Loss shocked Australia Seven Years Ago
By "MACNELL"
When Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey
Layton, C.-in-C. British Eastern Fleet,
submitted to the Lords Commissioners of
the Admiralty on December 17, 1941,
that they “be pleased to lay before the
Board the accompanying reports on the
operations resulting in the loss of H.M.
ships Prince of Wales and Repulse on
December 10, 1941,” he was reporting the
British Navy’s ijiost serious loss in cen-
turies.
Two mighty ships of the line, 67,000
tons of armored steel, guns and equip-
ment had been- blasted to the bottom of
the South China Sea by planes of the
despised little yellow men, at a cost to the
enemy of eight aircraft. When their loss
was reported to the world two immediate
reactions resulted: British loss of face
throughout the East and an electric
focketing of the Royal Navy’s assiessment
of its enemy—the latter by far the more
significant.
At noon on December 8 it had been re-
ported to Admiral Sir Tom Phillips,
K.C.8., R.N., then C.-in-C. Eastern Fleet
in Singapore, that Jap transports, under
cpver of warships, were landing troops at
Singgora on the east coast of the Kra
Isthmus and at Khqta Baru.
Half an hour later the Admiral had
assembled his captains and staff-officers
aboard the flagship. Prince of Wales, and
intimated that, as our Air Force and aero-
dromes were being heavily attacked, as
large enemy forces had already landed
and as the Army would soon be hard-
pressed, he found it inacceptable to retain
a powerful naval force inactive at Singa-
pore. The fleet would sail when ready in
all respects for sea.
It was a powerful squadron that cleared
Singapore Roads five hours later. Prince
of Wales, which had been with Hood in
the Bismarck hunt, was a new ship,
mounting 10 Min, guns in two quadruple
and one twin turret. Each could hurl a
smashing ton-weight of armor-piercing
metal 14 miles at high velocity ; and none
was destined to fire a shot against the
Eastern enemy.
The ship was to fight for her life with
16 dual-purpose 5.25’s in twin turrets,
pom-poms, oerlikons and her rudder. The
5.25 is the largest-calibre a.-a. gun in use.
Firing a high-explosive shell almost the
size of our cruiser Hobart’s main arma-
ment, with a lethal bursting radius in
proportion, the eight stretching snout
each side made a pin-cushion of her mid
ship structure. From near the bridge to
abaft the vital engine-rooms her under
belly was sheathed with a thick skin of
super-hardened armorplate.
Thirty-two-year-old Repulse, in which
H. B, Farncomb, now commanding the
Australian Squadron, served on exchange
duty as a lieutenant-commander in 1928
was not so heavily armored, but with her
six 15in. and 20 4in. guns, some in triple
mountings (an unusual arrangement), was
still a powerful heavy, combining the
leanness and speed of a cruiser with the
hitting-power of a battleship.
Designated Force Z, the squadron com-
prised Prince of Wales (Captain J. C
Leach, M.V.0., D. 5.0., R.N.), Repulse
(Captain W. G. Tennant, C. 8., M.V.O.
R.N.), and destroyers Electra (of later
Java Sea battle fame), Express, Tenedos
and Australian destroyer Vampire (Com-
mander W. T. A, Moran, R.A.N.), later
sunk off Ceylon. Admiral Phillips, the
senior officer, was flying his flag in Prince
of Wales.
“Shoot to Sink”
He informed ships’ companies of the
object of the sortie in a signal;
The enemy has made several landings
on the north coast of Malaya and has
made local progress. Our Army is not
large and is hard-pressed in places. Our
Air Force has had to destroy and abandon
one or more aerodromes. Meanwhile fast
transports lie off the coast.
This is our opportunity before the enemy
can establish himself. We have made a
wide circuit to avoid reconnaissance and
hope to surprise the enemy shortly after
sunrise tomorrow, Wednesday. We may
have the luck to try our metal against the
old Japanese battlecruiser Kongo or against
some Japanese cruisers and destroyers
which are reported in the Gulf of Siam.
We are sure to get some useful practice
with the h.a. armament.
Whatever we meet I want to finish quickly
and so get well clear to the-eastward before
the Japanese can mass too formidable a
scale of an air attack against us. So shoot
to sink.
common criticism levelled at
Admiral Phillips, as universal as it was
uninformed, was that he should have
arranged for air protection before sailing.
The facts are that the question of
fighter protection and reconnaissance
was discussed with R.A.F. headquarters
before the Force sailed, an elementary
precaution which any serviceman would
have assumed taken. The senior R.A.F.
officer stated that he hoped to be able
to provide reconnaissance, but was
doubtful about fighter protection over
Singgora at daylight on December 10.
After full investigation, he confirmed later
to Phillips’s Chief-of-Staff that these
fighters could no.t be provided.
Lack of aircraft regardless, to a man
steeped for a lifetime in the offensive
traditions of the British Navy, in com-
mand of two fighting-worthy capital ships,
the announcement that he found inaction
at Singapore, when Jap warships and
transports were disgorging unchecked on
the coast a few miles to the north, “in-
acceptable” was a masterpiece of under-
statement.
Tuesday, December 9, found the
squadron heading north at 24 knots,
Prince of Wales leading. A few cables
astern Repulse’s long, lean fo J c’sle parted
the milky white of her leader’s wake, and,
well ahead, the arrowhead of screening
destroyers shafted sonic fingers through
and around the sea, feeling for anything
that lurked beneath it.
Change of Plans
Rainstorms and low cloud were con-
ducive to evasion, of enemy reconnais-
sance, and the C.-in-C.’s intention, if un-
sighted by nightfall, was to return his
destroyers to Singapore—their vulnera-
bility to air-attack and low fuel endurance
would put him in the position of a heavy-
weight boxer fighting with a woman on
his arm—smash into the Jap landing
forces with all his speed and weight at
dawn and withdraw before an air-attack
could be massed.
When, between 1700 and 1830, the
weather cleared and three Jap reconnais-
sance planes in swift succession were
sighted from the flagship, these plans
were at once scrapped, Jn the 12 hours
before the squadron could make Sing-
gora the enemy would have dispersed and
be ready to welcome them with large-
scale air-attacks. With dusk. Force Z
altered course to the southward, for
Singapore.
The C.-in-C. signalled that he intended
retaining the destroyers -in company.
Destroyers to naval men are always
“boats'”; no one dreamed that in a few
short hours they would become lifeboats.
All that night, darkened and alert, the
British force slid towards base, reduced
to 20 knots to conserve the destroyers’
oil.
About midnight a signal from the
Chief-of-Staff in Singapore reported a
new enemy landing at Kuantan, about
140 miles from Singapore, not far off the
return track. As it was 400 miles from
Jap aerodromes in Indo-China, and was
considered a key military position which
every effort must be made to defend,
Admiral Phillips altered course to 245
degrees and increased to 25 knots to be
off the danger spot at daylight.
That morning the fleet passed down
inside the seven-fathom shoal lying due
east of Kuantan, about 10 miles from the
coast. Prince of Wales flew off an air-
craft and Express was sent ahead, a
terrier to sniff round the holes in the
coast. She entered Kuantan Harbor it-
self, returned and reported “complete
peace.”
An hour before reaching Kuantan they
had passed what seemed to be a tug and
four motor landing-barges. Phillips de-
cided to head eastward and investigate
these craft before retiring to Singapore.
It was while steaming east to do this that
Force Z was caught by about 50 Japanese
aircraft.
The Enemy
At 1015 the Admiral ordered all ships
to first degree of h.-a. readiness; this
meant guns’ crews actually closed up
ready for instant action. Shortly after.
Repulse’s radar revealed enemy planes,
and the first covey of high-level
bombers sighted at 1100 were met by a
ripple of flashes from their white-tailed
targets far below which ended in a chain
of vicious detonations high among them.
The fight was on.
The enemy planes sailed through the
barrage at 10,000 ft., dropped from their
bellies a cluster of black bombs and con-
tinned, remote and aloof, over and
beyond the British ships. The detached
specks resolved swiftly into 250-pounders,
then into streaks too fast to follow as they
neared their target—Repulse.
The first plunged into the sea abreast
B turret and the second, released a frac-
tion of time later, bored its armor-
piercing nose through Repulse’s port
hangar, through the marines’ mess-deck
and dissipated its force against her armor
above the engine-rooms. The remainder
of the salvo exploded in the sea.
Torpedo-bombers
A short lull enabled Repulse to fight
and douse her fires. Neither big ship—
the destroyers were left alone throughout
the action —had mounted their full bar-
rage against the high-level bombers.
With a dozen torpedo-bombers swinging
in low from the port side at both ships,
the battlers let go with everything. The
ships’ engaged sides flared redly. Shut
inside their eyeless turrets, the big-guns’
crews listened to the loud and continuous
roar of the barrage—above the cough of
pom-poms and the snarling rattle of
oerlikons the sharper, louder crack of the
5.25’5.
Repulse, speeding at 25 knots, waited
till her attackers were committed to their
final run and then, with all the torque
that hard-over rudder and thrusting
screws could give her, slewed her bulk
round and “combed” the parallel tracks
that reached like fingers towards her.
Aboard Prince of Wales the steaming
pom-poms were spitting out empties in
a clanging cascade. One eight-barrelled
mounting followed an oil-streaked belly
aiming for the foremast. Judging his dis-
tance to conserve ammunition, the fire-
control officer waited. With his shout
the layer pVessed his trigger and played
a lacework of stabbing red tracer around,
above and into the enemy plane.
A flick of red appeared, died, then
burst into a wind-whipped sheet of flame
that reduced the plane to a skeleton of
ribs in a few seconds. It hit the sea,
bounced, hit" again and disintegrated into
petrol-driven fire that flamed a moment
on the water, then died to coils of oily
smoke.
But another was behind him. They
saw his cigar-shaped load, propellers
already whirling, drop obliquely into the
sea. The' spearheaded track of water
reached out towards them. Suddenly
there was a roar against the ship’s side.
A snowy mound of water rose from the
sea, shaking the ship. The mound
swelled into a mountain, then broke into
great columns of water and flying spray,
high above the masthead as the concus-
sion of the hit crashed across the water.
It was a shrewd blow. The torpedo had
caught her aft, abreast P 3 5.25 turret, at
1144. By 1220 the great ship was listed
llj degrees to port, with the port side
of the quarterdeck awash. B engine-
room, Y boiler-room and Y turret action
machinery-room were flooded, and both
propeller-shafts stopped. Steering-gear
was damaged, and Prince of Wales was
never again under complete control; that
is, she was a sitting shot. And five. 5.25
turrets were put out of action by power
failures.
In the meantime high-level bombers
had again unloaded over Repulse, prob-
ably because they could not hope to
shear through Prince of Wales’s heavy
horizontal armor with their 250-pounders.
This attack, by skilful handling. Captain
Tennant rendered abortive, nothing drop-
ping closer than 50 yards.
Repulse Gets It
It was followed almost immediately by
another torpedo attack, carried out with
a determined cunning that was the be-
ginning of the end for Repulse. When
three miles distant, the incoming force
split into two, one of which kept on for
Repulse, the other altering towards Prince
of Wales, at that time abaft the battle-
cruiser’s port beam. As before, Captain
Tennant, with superb handling, swung
his ship at exactly the right moment,
slewing Repulse towards the nearer for-
mation as they dropped their loads. The.
battle-cruiser ploughed towards the deadly
tracks, and it seemed certain she should
comb them safely. At that moment the
second group swung ' abruptly from
Prince of Wales, pointed their noses at
Repulse and let go.
She was helpless. If she altered to
avoid the second menace she would lay
her whole length open to the torpedoes
she was just about to pass. From the
bridge they watched one track leap to-
wards them. Hundreds of pounds of
explosive savaged her plates port-side
amidships. But the old ship took the
hit well, and was able to maintain
manoeuvrability at 25 knots.
Captain Tennant remarked in his re-
port on the much higher level than 1 ours —
about 400 ft. —at which torpedoes were
dropped, and that they invariably ran
straight and fast.
The Flagship’s Turn
Now it was the other’s turn. Avoiding
her great belt of armor, the Jap torpedo
bombers put a fish into her bow, one
under her screws, starb’d-side aft, anc
another abreast B turret forrard. The
battleship, although still fighting, was
finished.
Then more torpedo-bombers swoopec
in from several directions at Repulse
The first hit jammed her rudder, anc
32,000 tons of steel plunged out of
control through the sea at over 20 knots
Three more torpedoes Caught her anc
shook her open to the sea. Captain Ten-
nant ordered all hands on deck to cast
loose Carley rafts, Fortunately the ship’s
broadcasters were still working, otherwise
hundreds of men would have been
trapped in watertight compartments deep
in her vitals in the six minutes she lasted
from “abandon ship.”
As it was, 42 officers and 754 men
managed to jump into the oil-scummed
sea before the gallant old ship, after
hanging poised for a minute or two at;
a list of 70 degrees, so that they could
see a great gash from a torpedo hit below
the starb’d bilge keel, rolled over at 1233.
Captain Tennant, half-choked with oil,
was dragged aboard destroyer Vampire.
His men still in the water, burned,
wounded, slimy with oil, when they saw
him lean over Vampire’s bridge-rail,
found voice to cheer him from the sea.
With Repulse gone,/ another forma-
tion of high-levellers straddled Prince of
Wales, now almost stopped, with a hit
on the catapult deck and near-misses that
opened her further. She, too, was ready
to go. Destroyer Express slid alongside
to take her wounded. Only a seaman,
with Express required to remain along-
side a critically listed battleship forging
uncontrolled over the sea at six knots,
will appreciate what that operation really
involved.
Then Prince of Wales lifted her great
bow with the weight of water aft, until
the armor-capped stem and its paravane
fittings, a wall of steel painted anti-foul-
ing red, lifted clear above the sea. An
enormous volume of water rushed
through her ’tween-decks, slamming doors
and trapping scores of men in the bowels
of the ship.
The end came suddenly. With Express
still alongside—the battleship’s heavy
bilge-keels hit her as she toppled—Prince
of Wales, men scrambling and falling
desperately down her horizontal side,
rolled quickly to port 47 minutes after
her consort and dropped in a maelstrom
of tossing water under the oil-black sea.
She took her Admiral with her.
Tribute
In this brief narrative it has not been
possible to detail the worth-while-report-
ing stories of nearly 3000 fighting men.
The Australian snotty who jumped from
Prince of Wales’s control-tower high above
the bridge, hit her exposed bilges and
slid into the sea; the sustained accuracy
of the close-range weapons that crashed
eight enemy planes; the unexpected
chivalry of Jap pilots who dipped in
salute over their enemies struggling in
the water; the chaplain last seen deep
down in a fume-filled compartment of his
ship administering last rites and a hypo-
dermic needle; or the stokers who, with
courage terrible to dwell upon, climbed
up from boiler-rooms inside the battle-
ship’s smoking funnel, until gloves were
burned through on the red-hot ladder
rungs, then flesh, and emerged to drop
over the tilted funnel-lip into the sea
with little left but a spark of life and
the incredible guts of common English-
men.
It is not the habit of Royal Navy
captains to extol their own ships’ com-
panies, and there is an actual regulation
which forbids publicised Service commen-
dation of any commissioned officer.
Captain Tennant’s report, published by
Admiralty authority in the London
“Gazette” this year, is therefore signifi-
cant ; —•
I should like to record here the mag-
nificent spirit of my officers and ship’s
company throughout their ordeal. Cases
occurred of men having 'to be ordered to
leave their guns to save themselves as the
ship was actually turning over. X find it
very difficult specially to recommend any
particular officer or man for decoration
because all in the ship carried out his duties
to the utmost, and it is possible that if
comparison could be made, many of those
who were lost are of all the most deserving.
A fitting tribute, applying just as ap-
propriately to Prince of Wales.


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4Jd. per line; all others 2£d. per line.
The Maori
The heated reply by Brigadier Hunt,
N.Z. E.C.A.F.E. delegate, to the Soviet
delegate’s remarks on Maori living
standards prompts me to add a little to
my remarks in B. 1/12/’4B.
The Brigadier’s claims were correct.
The social-security system in MX. does
apply to Maoris and whites; the Maoris
are fully represented in Parliament and
are elected by Maoris; and “the prin-
ciple of racial equality is probably more
completely respected in N.Z. than in any
other country.”
The Brigadier, however, left some
things unsaid. Maorilanders know that
the Maori problem, particularly in the
northern part of the North Island, is a
very real one at present, accentuated by
the fact that the Maori birthrate is not
far short of double that of the pakeha.
That there will be repercussions of
this in years to come is obvious. What
makes the picture frightening is the future
effect of the accelerated birthrate when
coupled with the startling increase in
Maori crime (20 per cent, of admissions
to prisons from a population percentage
of 5.8) and the growing tendency to rely
on beneficent social security.
All through the rationing period, Maori
tangis and celebrations were given lash-
ings of food and petrol, etc., when such
privileges were definitely not forthcoming
for pakehas. But then pakehas, today,
don’t keep Labor in power; the Maori
does. Labor’s policy all along has been
to spoonfeed the Maori. Yet at the
same time it has ignored the Maori’s
urgent need for help in other directions.
For years past, for instance, a Maori
Community Centre has been desperately
needed for the thousands of Maoris who
poured into Auckland during the war
and are there to stay. Convertible build-
ings were available, blueprints were
drawn up, and the Maoris were prepared'
to provide much of the necessary cash
themselves, but the Government was not
co-operative. Fulfilment of the plan
would have provided a gathering-place
where some semblance of communal
life could have been available —
much, if not most, of Maori de-
linquency and crime in the city
areas stems from the psychological con-
flict which arises when the Maori —
especially the young Maori —finds himself
a nonentity instead of a unit necessary
to the communal life, as in the days of
the pah.
The squalid hovels to which I referred
previously are also a major source of
trouble, and any Government, whatever
its efforts in other directions, is com-
placent when it allows such appalling con-
ditions to exist, or, having permitted them
to exist, does nothing to alleviate their
inevitable effect.
In talking with Maoris, Maori welfare
officers, church social workers running a
Maori mission, with the white matron of
a Maori hostel, with district health nurses
working among Maoris, with Rotarians
deeply concerned with the whole problem,
I found that all stressed the provision of
communal gathering centres and of decent
housing as the most vital need towards
Maori welfare in city areas. Anyone
who has seen the hovels in which city
Maoris exist does not wonder that t.b.
is the highest single cause of Maori
deaths. v
It is difficult for the pakeha to re-
member the essential difference in out-
look between himself and the Maori. The
Maori, by ancient instinct, hates privacy
and solitude, must feel part of a com-
munity. A deaconess at a Maori mission
told me how important it was for mission-
workers to remember this. If they didn’t,
they found their efforts unsuccessful. If
only a few people were engaged in a par-
ticular activity, Maoris would look in
and go hastily away ; if there were a
good attendance they would come in con-
fidently and swell the numbers further.
Auckland Y.M.C.A., which hired a
large room for a time and threw it open
for Maori gatherings, proved how easily
and eagerly Maoris would respond to
gatherings of this kind ; but unfortunately
the scheme had to be dropped through
lack of funds. Yet, even at this time,
the Government was proving lethargic
in its reception of the blueprint put for-
ward for a Maori Community Centre in
Auckland.
Anyone who has attended large gather-
ings of Maoris and has seen how easily
they are emotionally swayed appreci-
ates the dangers which may lie ahead if
Communistic orators get to work. I have
vivid recollections of attending a gather-
ing of a thousand Maoris at a Mormon
Conference and of seeing the way in
which they were almost hypnotised by the
Yankee visitors.
At any rate, the rising Maori birth-
rate, the increase in Maori crime, and the
release through social security from the
need to work as of old creates a situation
which allows no thinking Maorilander to
be smug; certainly not the M.L. Gov-
ernment. — Una Auld (N.S.W.).
Taxing Prizes
Dr. Paul Mueller, of Switzerland, who
won the £lO,OOO Nobel prize for discover-
ing D.D.T, is lucky not to be living in
Australia. If an Australian won a reward
like that there’d be mighty little of the
£lO,OOO left after the taxation people had
taken their cut.
Any rewards of this type should be
free of tax, whether they be for outstand-
ing research or for artistic or literary
achievement. “S. M. Herald” has set
aside £30,000 for the encouragement of
Australian literature, with £2OOO as the
annual first-prize for a novel, but the
taxgatherer takes a large portion of it.
Yet anyone can win £lO,OOO by blind
luck in a lottery and not pay a penny
tax on it.
Winning a prize for outstanding work
in science, literature or art involves years
of study, painstaking workmanship and
“ Couldn’t you change it for a boy, nurse?”
the skill born of assiduous prac-
tice. Writing an above-average book
can absorb all the spare time of years;
when following an important lead a re-
search-worker often puts in a 12-hour
day for weeks on end. What encourage-
ment is it to have half the reward
snatched away by the Taxation Depart-
ment?
The only case which comes to mind
in which a person was not treated in this
way in Australia was that of the inventor
of the Owen-gun. When it was knoym
that most of the reward paid to him
would be taken back in taxation
there was such an outcry that an
“adjustment” had to be made.
Large sums are not involved. To make
the “S. M. Herald” prizes, the S. H.
Prior Memorial Prize, the Archibald Prize
and others free from taxation would
not cost the Government more than
£2OOO a year. The Government pays
none of these rewards itself; all are paid
by business firms or from bequests left
for the purpose by public-spirited citizens.

Farm Labor
In his analysis of rural-labor trends
“C.B.M ” (B- 24/11/ ’4B) overlooks an
important point. Both farmer and
hands are coming to regard an
annual holiday as essential. On
the one-man farm it is almost impossible,
but on a larger unit, employing three or
four men, not only an annual break but
an occasional day or two off is quite
practicable. , . .
That consideration will play its part in
shaping the farm of the future. In this
district, at any rate, the general trend tor
many years has been towards larger areas,
many of them supporting two or three
families. The extra workers are paid
employees, sharefarmers or married
offspring of the owner. I’ve also heard
of partnerships, and there may be other
methods, such as co-operative farming.
The larger units, with several houses
grouped close together, simplify the pro-
vision of electricity, water, sewerage and
other amenities, and do away with isola-
tion and loneliness. A trip to town or the
pictures can always be sure of a full car-
load to reduce the cost per head.
The small farm and every-man-his-
own-boss ideal is a result of political
rather than economic or social thinking,
and in far too many cases it leads to
poverty and slavery.— Heresone (Q.).
New States
A favorite argument of . those opposed
to new States is that the cost of support-
ing more Parliaments would be exorbit-
ant. In actual practice this is not so.
New England, with a Parliament only
the size of Tasmania’s, would be very
cheaply governed. Such a Parliament,
consisting of two elected Houses and 48
members, with a Cabinet of nine, would
cost the northern people only 2s. Bd.
per head a year. This compares more
than favorably with Westralia’s 4s. lid.,
Tasmania’s 4s. 3d., or S.A.’s 2s. lid.
The people of a new State would not
want a complicated Parliament. A popu-
lation of 400,000 could be more than
comfortably governed by Tasmania’s
small Parliament, which governs only
250,000.
At present New England returns 12
members to the N.S.W. Assembly (no
Cabinet Ministers among them), and is
entitled to eight members in the Council.
Actually there is no member of the
Council with an address in the New-State
area.
The extra number of .politicians re-
quired for the New-State Parliament
would only be 28, bringing the total
number to 48. A small Cabinet of nine
members would cost a good deal less
than the larger Cabinets in other States.

Government Services
In 'moving a losing motion to give
country users electric power without a
guaranteed cost-covering charge, the Tas-
manian Opposition-leader revived an
ancient vote bait. Power, transport and
other public utilities are subject to the
eternal question—should they be run to
cover costs or should they serve every-
one needing them and pile up losses?
Undoubtedly the dwindling race of
regulation-smitten country dwellers should
get all services possible, but if Govern-
ments must operate departments to give
certain services, they should certainly be
run on business lines to cover their own
working- costs and interest charges.
If it is necessary to serve centres which
cannot meet the cost, surely it would be
better to establish an independent fund
to make up the loss. The department
supplying the service could then quote
the income required to cover costs of
supply to a certain centre. It would be
the responsibility of the supporters of
the extension to convince the fund con-
trollers that a subsidy should be pro-
vided.
The service department would then be
free to concentrate on giving the best
service at the cheapest rate and its re-
sponsibility would stop there. Depart-
ment heads would be freed from the
worry of fiddling politicians who could
wrangle with the fund controller to their
heart’s content while the department
occupied itself with the objects of its
establishment. — Metax (Tas.).
Ideal Train
On November 26 the second of N. S.
Wales’s air-conditioned six-carriage trams
was put on the Inter-City Express,
Sydney-Newcastle run.
Softly lit with fluorescent lighting and
lined with Australian silky oak, the all-
steel carriages are the last thing in luxury
and modern design. In first-class the
seats are deep, individual, self-adjustable
airways type; in second-class they are
just as resilient and comfortable, but
made in pairs with a centre arm-rest. All
face the engine for the smooth, clean trip.
The toilets are as modern as tomorrow,
with elaborate fittings, hot and cold
running water, etc. Iced drinking-water
is available in waxed cardboard con-
tainers.
A loudspeaker system announces that
the train, stopping only at Strathfield or
Hornsby, will arrive in Newcastle in
exactly two hours 13 minutes from time
of departure, and that refreshments will
be available. Courteous girls take orders
and, after placing a small table in front
of you, bring along the victuals. Service,
food and crockery have taken on new
standards. The matching crockery—deep
plates and saucers and spherical-shaped
cups —appear to have been specially de-
signed for train travel.
Personally, I alighted at Newcastle
able for the first time in my life to report
that I had completed a really enjoyable
train trip. If this is a design for the
future, our N.S.W. railways will be fast
approaching American standards at —
with an odd 13s. or 19s. for this journey
—what must be the world’s lowest fares.

A National Trust
As one of a group which has been
trying to establish a National Trust in
S.A., I can give “Honourit” an idea of
some of the obstacles (B. 17 /11 / ’4B).
Most people have no idea what a
national trust is. It is not a Government
venture, and Governments have no say
in it.
Such a trust is formed by public-
spirited people whose standing in the
community is a guarantee of probity. It
is incorporated to enable it to hold
land, buildings and money or valuables
in trust for the people, and it then appeals
for donations and bequests.
Trust appeals are never made in vain
—the National Trust of Britain now
controls an immense amount of property
and has a large sum of money to carry
out its work. It takes control of anything
worth preserving—historic buildings,
battlefields, collections of paintings and
other art treasures, areas of country
with scenic beauty, forests and national
monuments in the form of unique geo-
logical features. Here in Australia we
would have to concentrate more on flora
and fauna reserves, aboriginal rock-carv-
ings and cave-paintings, fine old trees,
geological formations of great value to
science and things like that.
Another misconception is that anyone
who deeds property to a national trust
loses all rights or interests in it. If, say,
a man has on his property a bed of
fossils, a prehistoric glacial moraine or
any other geological feature worth pre-
serving as a national monument, he can
deed it to the trust and thereafter neither
he nor anyone else can damage it in any
way—but his sheep can still graze around
it. All that interests the trust is that
the thing shall be preserved.
Another common idea is that forming
and running a national trust is a job
for people with a lot of academic know-
ledge but no business ability. The oppo-
site is the case —the job calls for sound
commonsense, the ability to look ahead,
to spend money to the best possible
advantage and to know an opportunity
when it’s offering. Trust people have to
be the kind who automatically think what
they can do, and not the type which says
“But the Government should”
Once formed and incorporated, with the
right type of men and women in charge,
a national trust cannot fail. Running
expenses are very low—trustees give their
services, and the salary list includes only
a few people in the office and a few care-
takers. A fund is built up from donations
and bequests, to be used in buying any-
thing worth preserving, and as the years
pass the trust acquires areas of mountain
and coastal scenery which the people can
use as parks and playgrounds, historic
buildings which are used to house art
collections or which are let to tenants
whose rent meets the cost of upkeep,
libraries and collections of paintings, bird
sanctuaries and similar things. The man-
agement has all the efficiency of private
enterprise, and there is no “dead hand”
of Government.
The biggest difficulty of all in Australia
will be to persuade the Government to
make all donations or bequests tax-free. —
H. A. Lindsay (S.A.).
