THE GALLOPING SQUIRE.
Cornell ’ll show you a country that none can sur-
For a flyer to cross like a bird on the wins’.
We have acres of woodland and oceans of grass
We have game in the autumn and cubs in the
spring;
We slare BC ° reS ° f g °° d follows han 8' out in the
But the best of them all is the Galloping Squire.
The Galloping Squire to the saddle has got,

Like liarriers turning or chasing like fire,

ing Squire. 1
u?? wav®.of his arm, to the covert they throng ;
Yoi. wind him ! and rouse him ! By Jove ! he’s
away ! ”
I hrough a gap in the oaks see them speeding along
Uer the open like pigeons: “They mean it to-
day !
You may jump till you ’re sick — you may spur till
you tire !
For ’em who can ! ” says the Galloping
Then he takes the old horse by the head, and he
sails
In the wake of his darlings, all ear and all eye,
As they come in his line, o’er banks, fences and
rails, . '
The cramped ones to creep, and the fair ones to fly
it s a very queer place that will put in the mire
ouch a rare one to ride as the Galloping Squire.
But a fallow has brought to their noses the pack,
And the pasture beyond is with cattle-stain
spread ;
One wave of his arm, and the Squire in a crack
Has lifted and thrown in the beauties at head.

So forty fair minutes they run and they race,

1 hough the horses we ride are such gluttons fo

There are stout ones that stop, they are safe one
that fall.
But the names of the vanquished need never tran

For they’re all in the rear of the Galloping Squire
Thll the gamest old varmint that ever drew breath
All stiffened and draggled, held high for a throw
O er the Squire's jolly visage is grinning in death
Jtre he dashes him down to be eaten below;
While the daws flutter out from a neighboring
spire
At the thrilling who-whoop of the Galloping
Squire.
And the laborer at work, and the lord in his hall,
Have a jest or a smile when they hear of the
sport ;
In ale or in claret he’s toasted by all,
For they never expect to see more of the sort.
And long may it be ere he’s forced to retire
J or we breed very few like the Galloping Squire.
G. J. Whyte-Melville.
It is no wonder that the English love
Whyte-Melville ; for lie incarnates the best
qualities of the English character (now,
alas ! being debased and destroyed by Cities
and Competition)—the honest simplicity,
the mAnlv courage, the Yiking love of fight-
ing and drinking, the sympathy with Nature
and the frank delight in field-sports—horse
and rod and gun and the breath of the open
air. There is the same hearty love of
life in Kingsley and Blackmore ; but both
Blackmore and Kingsley were refined a
little from the breed of Whyte-Melville:
one evidence of it is the disproportionate
space occupied by Love and Woman in their
romances. Melville belonged to the purer
race for whom Woman, if not subordinate
and secondary, was distinctly not the chief
item in the salad-bowl of life. She gave
the salad flavour, of course ; she was to be
adored ardently in due season, held in all
honour and reverence, and cheered enthusi-
astically when she came to the meet; but
she had her place and her impassable limita-
tions. As to living for her or dying for her,
that was manifestly absurd while there was
an uneasy stag in covert, and the hounds
threw off at ten in the morning. The Mel-
ville hero sang with Suckling—
If of herself she will not love,
Nothing can make her:
The Devil take her !
None the less, Melville had that strong vein
of sentiment which lies hidden in so many
simple natures—a proper melancholy, born
of the something bitter which is tasted in the
happiest human heritage, yet never enough
to loosen his seat or spoil his appetite. In
his books he stresses Love and Sentiment
unduly, because when he wrote his books his
youth had passed, and because in books that
is the fitting thing to do. But in his life he
was as cheery a heathen as a man can be.
• * • *
Whyte-Melville was only 28 when he re-
tired with his majority from a brief service
in the army ; and .the greater part of his life
was spent in hunting and writing. Appro-
priately enough, he died from a hunting
accident in 1878, in his 57th year. His
novels muster over a dozen, none of them
remarkable; but all so full of breezy life
and manly enthusiasm that they are readable
to this day. A. L. Gordon, naturally
enough, was strongly influenced by Melville;
and a reader of his verses comes across
many phrases and ideas directly adapted
from Melville’s work. But Gordon, with a
character like Melville’s in many vvays, car-
ried Melville’s pleasant melancholy to tragic
depths. He had all the .good instincts, but
not the tough fibre of the older man. And
circumstances were more unkind to Gordon.
If he had gained his Scotch barony, we
might still be making pilgrimages to watch
mm riding, or condoling with one another
over the loss of vigour in his latest verses.
* • • ,
In Whyte-Melville’s “ Songs and Verses ”
tiiere is probably enshrined the kernel of his
nature The long poem of “ The
true Cross ” has some pleasant lines, but no
value if judged by the standard of nowa-
days ; and the novels will only live by reason
of a few picturesque chapters and passages.
J3ut the hunting songs—such as “ The Gal-
loping Squire ” —will surely endure as long as
there is a fox or a stag to chase in Britain.
Ut poetic merit in the high sense, as can be
seen from the example, they have nothing.
But they are so true, so vital, so filled with
the natural spirit and emotion of the scene
and the conflict, that it is no wonder they
represented the acme in Poetry which a last-
generation squire could conceive. How was
it possible (in Somerset) to refuse admira-
tion to the man who could write “ Brow
Bay, and Tray ” ? ’
I irst came the Harbourer,
Ihe Harbourer, the Harbourer;
-fc irst came the Harbourer,
Before the dawn was clear.
And here he stooped, and there he stood,
Ana round the combe he made it good,
And harboured in the Lower Wood
A warrantable deer !
Some twenty score, he said, and more
■ -Hie noble beast would weigh,
For he d brow, bay and tray, my lads—
J3row, bray and tray !
(Chorus.) Then here’s to him who leads the hunt
With “Tally-ho! Away!”
And brow, bay and tray, my lads—
Brow, bay and tray !
Next came the Tufters,
The Tufters, the Tufters—
Next came the Tufters,
Tufting through the brake,
And opened on him, staunch and sure,
And moved him, where he couched secure,
And drove him forward o’er the moor
His gallant point to make.
While on his track the zealous pack
.We did our best to lay ;
For he’d brow, bay and tray, my lads—
Brow, bay and tray !
(Chorus.) Then here’s to him, &c.
And if there were some who preferred red
Reynard and the flurry for the brush, what
could they possibly have better than “ Tally-
Ho ” ? J
“ fOT a hundred !” they know it, the pack,
Uld Chorister always speaks true,
And the whip from his corner is told to come back,
And forbid to go on for a view.
Now the varmint is spied, as he crosses the ride,
A tough old campaigner, I trow—
i<TT^L^in^)?r ’ and grey, see him stealing away—
Half-a-minute !—and then—Tally-Ho !
Mark Fanciful standing, all eye and all ear
One second, ere, wild for the fun,
She is lashing along with the pace of a deer,
Her comrades to join in the run.
Your saddle yon grip, gather bridle and whip,
Give your hunter the office to go,
In his rush through the air little breath is to spare
hor the cheer of your wild Tally-Ho !
And was there one huntsman of them all
whose eyes would not moisten at “The
Place Where the Old Horse Died.”
Was he blown ? I hardly think it. Did he slip ’
I cannot tell.
We had run for forty minutes in the vale.
He was reaching at his bridle; he was going strong
and well,
And he never seemed to falter or to fail ;
Though I sometimes fancy, too,
That his daring spirit knew
The task beyond the compass of his stride.
Yet he faced it true and brave,
And dropped into his grave
At the place where the old horse died.
♦ ♦ * ,
Though Gordon often suggests Whyte-
Melville, Gordon is not his closest Australian
analogue. It is “The Dingo of Brigalow
Gap,” in Ogilvie’s book of verses, which
would have been found in Melville’s pages
had Melville written in Australia. But Ogil-
vieis also removed, and chiefly because in him
sentiment deepens to pathos. Harry Morant,
“The Breaker” of numerous Bulletin
verses, has Melville’s temperament and
tastes, but not quite his head. Morant and
Ogilvie mixed in the same saddle would give
us almost exactly an Australian Whyte-
Melville.

The well-known J. A. Andrews—who is,
by the way, singularly like the deceased
French poet Verlaine in face and figure—
relates some of his experiences :
« lr haV< l ha ; d „ t } le experience of being an Anarchist.
. bLave had, for I don’t call myself one now. It
isn’t that I have changed my principles. I may
be more accommodating as to their application
on account of a growing idea that, after all, the
outer forms and mere mechanism of society are of
trivial importance. I may be less intent upon
promulgating a detailed philosophy of society
through having realised that the world progresses
chiefly without resort to theory, even as people are
born, and grow up, and hang on to life
chiefly without reference to biological science’.
But not for these reasons would I have
rejected the name that used to call forth
all my enthusiasm. I do so because misre-
presentations, accidental at first and afterwards
given color to in connection with persecutions and
personal reprisals, have been spread in advance of
the actual doctrines, not only ensuring them pre-
judiced interpretation, but even creating a hybrid
anarchism, inclusive of the faith (contradicted by
pure anarchist theory) in dynamite and da<«, er .
Abroad, also, many now prefer to discardable
name, though of course some cling to it as to an
old flag, and will cherish it affectionately till the
end. #
* * * *
In Dibbs’s time the French Government insti-
gated international suppression of “anarchism ”
and MW. caught up the idea. I was then re-
garded as being locally the anarchist, so came
in for most of. the suppression. Here’s a
sample; Person strikes up acquaintance with
me, and introduces another, who claims to
lie a 1' ranch anarchist just out, and who
then wants to deposit with me the secret
ot a beautiful infernal machine. First person
P i oves to be a detective. Shortly afterwards,
another frenchman introduces himself to my
landlady (I had just taken new lodgings in a cel-
ar '" , hives in the house a week without meeting
me, then inquires for a Mr. Andrews, who lives
somewhere in the street, and who has been men-
tioned to him as able to give him lessons in Eng-
Jisti Jxesult I agree to give the lessons, at a
shilling an hour. English being a dry subject,
pupil keeps talking about something else. Social
questions uppermost in his mind. In a week
learns that I am an Anarchist. He is one, too.
JNotices that lam very hard-up, and insists on
Helping a comrade—gives me blankets, a table and
chair, I having none before. Then, after a while,
tells me he is an amateur chemist and inventor of
explosives. Wants to experiment in that line—
not with a view to bomb-making, he explains
(although he thinks the dynamite policy a good
one, and argues the point with me), and even if it
were tor that purpose, well, it would be on his
own sole responsibility. He would not trouble
PJ e > bu . t ’ mas ! he doesn't know the English names
ot the ingredients he requires. If he states them in
Jt rench, will I write out the list in English ? I see
the point (and eventually ascertain tliat my kindly
comrade ism the employ of the already-mentioned
detective). Not unnaturally infer that the Govt,
nas instructed its officials to manufacture a bogus
case against me. Believe myself doomed , and think
of taking vengeance in advance of the blow that is to
crush me. Only restrained by idea (product of the
morbidly suspicious state that months of this sort
ot thing have worried me into), “ Perhaps that is
just what they are cunningly playing for. ” That’s
what 1 know about “ suppression of ‘anarchism,’”
and a twelvemonth of it left me in a condition
which, when I look back on it, seems unpleasantly
like insanity.
* * * .
It might be supposed that the prevalent mis-
conception with regard to anarchists would have
caused some inconvenience, to say the least, in my
everyday relation to other persons, but such was
not the case. Some, of course, had been familiar-
ised with my views while the dynamite-and-dagger
misrepresentation was dormant, and others appar-
ently never thought of “outrages” except in
connection with foreigners and abroad. Business
men and others in good position generally confessed
that my views, in great part at least, were true in
the abstract, but, they said, Utopian—though not
a few were prepared to expect a moderate instal-
ment of socialism —and then some of them might
say, “ But really, don’t you think your crowd on
the other side of the world go a little too
far when they blow people up?” in a tone
that seemed to add, ‘ 1 Of course there’s
no accounting for political opinions.” A few
uneducated working chaps might insist that I
was not an anarchist, because it was in the news-
papers that anarchists tried to blow up anybody;
but (save once) I never found private persons im-
puting conventional cablegram anarchism to me,
except at Domain meetings, and there, in most
cases, the imputation was made by some State
socialist of the German “ benevolent despotism ”
school, whose theory is that the Individual is a
nucleus of natural depravity, and only to be
tolerated in a state of total and abject subordina-
tion to Superior Authority—the only source of
morality and virtue.
♦ * * *
I asked one of these, who interrupted me on one
occasion, “Do you mean to say that if there were
no law forbidding it, and no policemen or gaols,
you would go about committing murder and rape
and assault and robbery on the people you met ? ”
Of course I expected a reply in the negative, and
meant to say then, “Don’t you think most other
people are about as good as you ? ” but to my
amazement he declared “I most certainly would.”
“ Well,” I replied, “if you say so seriously, you
are, on your own showing, a criminal lunatic, and
beside the question in discussing the proper rela-
tion of sane and normal persons to each other in
society.” That he did affirm it seriously was
shown by the rage he at once flew into ; he seemed
on the point of knocking me down with a heavy
walking-stick. The audience, however, would have
intervened if he had attempted it; after getting
heard a few times I could always rely on the
protection of the crowd, as was proved several
times when larrikins or bigots essayed rough treat-
ment. He took a different revenge by subse-
quently denouncing me as an advocate of dynamite
and assassination.
* * * *
More annoying, because less malicious, were the
inquiries sometimes put by very ignorant persons
—“Who pays you to come down and talk ? What
do you make out of it ? ” My appearance might
well have prevented those queries, for I had been
living most wretchedly from hand to mouth ever
since I tramped from Victoria—two years before I
commenced speaking regularly in the Domain—
and was literally ragged. I could not have
brought myself to appear before a crowd if I had
not been inspired by intense enthusiasm. As a
matter of fact (if anyone is curious to know) I was
even then spending money on the work, never got
anything out of it except when I distributed liter-
ature, would not have done so then if it had not
been a matter of necessity, and spent in the aggre-
gate twice or thrice as much as I thus received.
On the other hand, I used to be told that I was
making my opinions stand in the way of my liv-
ing. This was equally a mistake; the trouble was
that I was over-sensitive, and if I forced myself,
despite that, to bargain or canvass my abilities, I
was sure to be sick and practically incapacitated
for the next three days.
* * * *
It was most vexatious to be stuck up by people
who would say, “I have listened to you for a long
time Sunday after Sunday, and quite agree with
you that it is neoessary to take individual action
to kill off some of the scoundrels on top, ” which I
had never advocated and always disapproved of.
But, as I have indicated, these were not private
persons, a fact almost “ given away, ” too, by. the
circumstance that the accoster always had a friend
with him at the time. The private persons were
more likely to ask for explanations of the theory
on points they had missed—or perhaps to try to
convert me to their particular “isms ” if they had
any. Besides what was said directly to ine, X
heard, of course, all sorts of remarks. Most
common was, “ That’s the anarchist,” from one to
another as I walked about. Whilst I was speak-
ing they varied from “Oh ! the fellow’s mad ! ” to
the opposite extreme, the average being, “ There’s
a good deal in what he says.” Some of the
opinions passed, however, were decidedly start-
ling. Two persons concluded that I was Christ
come to earth again. As a set-off to their convic-
tions, another person rushed away from the crowd
crying loudly in tones of horror, Is that the
Antichrist?” Most extraordinary, perhaps, was
the information volunteered by an orthodox State
Socialist to his companion, “The Government
subsidises them” (indicating me,and a comrade)
“to bolster up the present system by agitating
against socialism ”- - and this really seemed to be an
article of faith with many State Socialists of the
time, because some German State Socialist writer
had made a similar assertion about anarchists.
A book-writer reported to be “selling by
millions” is Charles M. Sheldon, author of
“In His Steps : ‘ What would Jesus Do ?’”
and similar curious works. The heroes of
Mr. Sheldon’s romances habitually arrest
themselves with the whisky at their lips and
give themselves into custody till’they have
settled the question whether Jesus ever
drank whisky, or would drink it. As
it is a certainty that he didn’t, and
wouldn’t, if it is anything like the stuff vou
get in the average public-house, the heroes
sentence themselves to a week’s prayer or
40s. in the missionary-box ; and the whiskey
is dashed to burn a hole in the linoleum.
Then the heroes pay for the tumblers and go
out of the public-houses trailing Large
Coarse Morals behind them. The Morals
have moved certain immoral reviewers
to denounce Charles M. Sheldon and
his books as balderdash. But taken
in a proper spirit they classify their author
among the great humorists of the century.
You laugh as spontaneously over them as
over “Many Cargoes’’and Joe’s old Dad.
Mr. Dooley is an owl by comparison with
Charles M. Sheldon.

And Justin Huntly M‘Carthy is divorced
from Cissie Loftus, yet (as a watchful contri-
butor points out) dedicates to her the new
edition of his prose Omar—as who should
say, “Well, thank the Judge we’re two
again ; and this is to show there’s no cool-
ness between us.” They say the lady is not
as attractive as she was when she caught
Justin’s jaded fancy—a gamine in a white
gown, with a flat chest, thin arms, and her
hair all round her adorable little face. She
must have been charming then, that music-
hall imitatress, to draw these charming verses
from her (1) lover, (2) husband, (3) friend.
A VISION OF ARCADY.
Through a fever of painted faces,
A revel of flesh,
Through flutter of lifted laces
And strident thresh
Of a music, barbarous, loud,
Through a leering, laughing crowd,
Wanders a wonderful thing,
A girl with the grace of Spring.
A beautiful maiden blossom,
A girl like a rose,
As pale as the pale flower’s bosom,
As pure as its snows.
Dark are her tresses ; her eyes
Candid and blue as the skies;
How from Arcadia beguiled
Wanders this wonderful child ?
Her face with its careless sweetness,
Her ribbon-bound hair, •
Her dress with its simple neatness,
Her indolent air,
Calm in that clamorous space,'
Seem out of tune, out of place,
As if sortie nymph of the glade
Appeared at a masquerade.
, She seems in that throng, she only,
As free as a faun
In the still, green forest, as lonely
And cool as the dawn
Breathing on feverish eyes
When a night of revel dies,
And longings for streams and trees
Arise with the rising breeze.

IV. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir, —For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano &alis,” and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligonoolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTOHS SAY
Doveton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon, — August 21 st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, TIIOS. LE GAY HOLTHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

Hundreds have been perma-
nently cured by this wonder-
ful remedy as applied by the
great American Invention—
“ Dr. Pierce’s Galvanic
Chain Belt.” Scores of grateful letters like the fol-
lowing are constantly being received :
From Africa : “ Somerset East, Cape Colony, South
Africa, Aug. 15,1898. I am much pleased to say that Dr.
Pierce’s Galvanic Chain Belt acted like a charm with me.
I am now cured and strong.—Yours truly, T. E. Wise.”
From England : “ I am extremely pleased to be enabled
to say that your Belt has had a wonderful effect in curing
me of varicocele.— Thos. Bannister, 13 Richmond Road,
Montpelier, Bristol.” From Australia : “ I am now a
new man, after taking tons of medicine which did me no
good. I was hardly able to walk before I got your Belt.—
D. Cameron, 1 Stewart Place, Paddington, Sydney, N.S.
Wales.” From America : “ Co. H, 18th Infantry, U.S.
Army, Camp Merritt, San Francisco, June 9, 1898. Last
October, while in garrison at Fort Bliss, El Pgso, Texas,
I sent for one of your famous Dr. Pierce’s Electric Belts
for Rheumatism, &c., and after wearing it on by about two
months my complaints entirely disappeared, and I have
not been troubled with any pain or discomfort since.—
Yours gratefully, John P. Anderson.”

Various Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One Elida Wilburn, of ’Frisco, had, over
a year ago, a quarrel with her lover, which ended
in her fainting. All efforts to restore her failed,
and she remained comatose (being artificially fed to
sustain life) until recently. Then she showed signs
of awakening, and the lover was brought in haste
to the bedside. But, regaining her senses, and
seeing the young man standing by, she took up
quarrel precisely where it had been inter-
rupted 12 months before. The Pertinacious Sex !
Will Ogilvie’s book of verses, “ Fair Girls
and Gray Horses,” continues to sell splendidly. It
is unquestionably the most generally-attractive
poetry-book yet issued in Australia. Price, 4s. 6d.,
post-free from Bulletin office. •
Dreyfus.
Dead is the star of Truth—the light has sunk
Beneath a sweltering fen of lies and hate ;
Each turbid day is noisome with the fate
Of leprous liars, whose foul names have stunk.
France, who has loved and lost the free, is drunk.
She who of old has lifted up the gate
Of Truth, to ope’ her perilous path and strait,
Now is the sport of every knave and funk.
As a clear river issuing from the hills
With but the tribute of a little cloud,
And the divine effulgence of the dews,
Swol’n with the laboring leagues, its compass fills
With offal, and rank carrion, and the ooze
Of the dead men and women in its shroud.
HUBERT CHURCH.
The Sad Joy.
A Joy came to me in my woe,
A seeming Heaven-sent ray,
That through the break in this sad heart
Made swift and shining way.
My spirit up one moment leapt
Toward the evening light,
Then Joy my house of life revealed,
Despoiled, dismantled quite.
O Joy ! I deemed you sunshine kind,
And gave you faith and prayer,
But 10, you were the lightning-flash
To show me my despair !
M.A.R.
Suspiria.
Clasped in the clinging arms of Death she lies,
All robed in white, as best befits a bride,
In solemn state amongst white draperies—
The mirror by her side.
The deadly crystals glitter in the glass,
The last late roses glimmer on her bed ;
Between the slats the sunbeams slide, and pass
To greet her who is dead.
She does not hear them buzzing at the door,
She heeds no comment of the curious crowd ;
She will not sin nor suffer any more,
Peace wraps her in its shroud.
And I? I have no sighs of vain regret
For dear lost love, for fond hopes vanished,
No tender tears her poor pale fingers wet
Even now—when she lies dead !
Ah, deeper, deeper than the deepest hell—
More vain than life, more sad than friend forgot,
My grief ; who grieve not that I loved too well,
But that I loved her not!
DORA WILCOX.
A Ballade of Boom.
Life’s a laugh when the land is gay ;
Life’s a joke when the land is new;
Never a soul who pays his way ;
Devil a care if the debts are due;
State in pawn to a distant Jew ;
Up to the eyes we are all immersed ;
Hark to the song of the crazy crew :
“ Beg and borrow and boom and burst! ”
We are the prize of the birds of prey;
We are the men of the prospect blue;
We are the gallants who sing the lay,
“ We shall riot and ye shall rue.
Empty purse and a bank askew ;
People blind with a rage accurst,
Mutt’ring all in a drunken stew :
“ Beg and borrow and boom and burst! ”
Debts and duns in a grim arrray
Tell their tale of the cash we drew ;
We have banqueted—ye shall pay !
Hang the land and the children too !
Our ideals are small and few—
“ Lend us a shilling to quench our thirst;
Here’s success to the broth we brew—
“ Beg and borrow and boom and burst ! ”
ENVOI.
Cursed imps of a doting day,
Fool-begotten and Bedlam-nursed;
Black is the lot of the land ye sway—
Beg and borrow and boom and burst !

yankee Doodle
IN AMERICA.
The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth..
La Fayette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and fife
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankep Doodle was heard as never
was heard before or since.

What the Bill Offers to N.S. Wales.
On June 20th the people of New South Wales
have to decide whether they will accept or reject
the Federation which is offered to them. Many
accomplished liars and the Daily Telegraph
(which will lose at least £5OOO a year if the
Federal capital isn’t in Sydney, and is, therefore,
against every form of Federation which doesn’t
put the capital there) are streaming around the
province, telling the people about the dreadful
things that aren’t in the Bill, and the awful
calamities which won’t happen if the people
accept this chance of making an Australian nation.
None of these persons venture to state in which
clause or chapter of the Bill their alleged calamities
can be found ; the party which invents its calami-
ties as it goes along can only say in a fine, large,
loose way that the thing is there somewhere, and
anybody who can’t find it, or can’t see it is there
without finding it, is a fool. The Bulletin
doesn’t propose to get down to the level of the
Dibbs and Heydon and MacLaurin and G-eorge
Pile’s dog gang in this matter, so in giving a
statement of some advantages which New South
Wales has to gain by accepting the Bill it offers
wherever possible the evidence of the Bill itself in
its latest amended form:—
■* * * »
(1) The Bill abolishes all interprovincial customs duties
(Clause 92), therefore it opens to New South Wales the
'hi 1 ® v ° ther . Provinces which are now mostly
closed to her by lnterprovincial tariffs. New South
Wales gives practically nothing in return for this advan-
tage, her own markets being already open free to the
products of the other provinces, sugar excepted
By abolishing interprovincial tariffs it will im-

Also, it vv ill rescue the trade from something- very nearly

TOW-or th e / '.' CJeots Federation the Victorian and
Westrahan coal-duties will almost certainly arrive sooner
must foiiow fc rL b ; WeBt Newcastle has ever seen
must follow. Last year, the foreign coal-exports showed
a serious decline, and but for the great increase in the
lnterprovincial trade the industry would have had a very
bad time. The New South Wales anti-Federal Vartv
tomers ancTto'tellVh ' ° k thei !.' be3t and onl -V reliable cus

South Wales coal industry by giving the Federal Par-
liament power to abolish the differential railway rates
now charged in Victoria on New South Wales coal (Vic-

, The . unequal rate which Victoria charges

sanc , t ; lon ed by the Bill. The Bill will also bring
extra trade to the New South Wales railways by abolisli-
een -n a K d 8 bor der-export duty of £2 a ton on wool.
(4) It will bring a lot more trade to the New South
rrl r ?i"? },s by giving power (clauses 102 and 104) to
abolish the huge system of cheap freights bv which Vic-
-r^ 68 ofl much of the western and southern wool-
trade. Some of these cheap freights are so cheap that
they are only one-third of the regular Victorian rates.

(6) New South Wales will have the largest vote in the
Federal Parliament (clause 24).
on l & ay r° heavie *' taxation than any other State,
the bf 3 of interested parties to the contrary
and all the curse language of Sydney Telegraph (which
will have to pay £5OOO a year extra in telegraphic ex-
penses and salaries through the capital not bein<- in
Sydney, and is mad-quite naturally). Clause 51, section
“> distinctly specifies that in taxation the Government
shall not “discriminate between States.” Section 3 of
the same clause declares that all bounties granted by the
Commonwealth “ shall be uniform throughout the
Commonwealth.”
( 8 ) Sydney and Newcastle will under Federation
the best chance they have yet possessed to become great
distributing ports—when goods landed there can go free
of duty to any part of the Commonwealth.
(9) New South Wales will have an absolutely free hand
to grant bounties in aid of mining for metals, and bavin f
a larger variety of metals than any other province, bar
(Queensland, she gets the best of the bargain here. In all
other respects she is on the same level as regards boun-
ties as the other provinces (clauses 90 and 91).
* * * »
(10) New South Wales will retain its own public lands
and other assets. It can hand over its railways to the
Commonvvealth or not, just as seems best for its own
separate interests. Sections 33 and 34 of clause 51 dis-
tinctly specify that the Commonwealth can’t interfere in
this matter without the consent of the State.
(11) It retains control over its share of the rivers—in
fact, it is not certain that it doesn’t get more control
than it has now. At present Queensland can shut off
the Upper Darling and use it for irrigation purposes
Also, Victoria can obliterate the Murray for two-thirds of
its New South Wales course. Down to nearly abrea«t of
Balranald, in Western New South Wales, the Murray is
almost wholly fed by Victorian streams, and Victoria
whenever it is ready to irrigate on a large scale can
annex the lot. The only clause (No. 100) dealing ’with
rivers says that the Commonwealth “shall not abridge
the right of a State or of the residents therein to the
reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation
and irrigation.” There is at least room here for New
South VVales to plead that the wholesale annexation of
the Upper Darling by Queensland and the drying up of
the Murray by Victoria (calamities which she has only
escaped under the provincial system because irrigation is
still in its infancy)are unreasonable use.
(12) New South Wales, like any other province, is pro-
tected against any liability for debts other than its own
Clause 105 specifies that, “ The States shall indemnify the
Commonwealth in respect of debts taken over,” and that
if the Commonwealth takes over the debt of a State the
interest thereon shall be deducted from that State’s share
of the surplus.
(13) With Federation and a uniform tariff Sydney will
no longer be, as it is now, under a tremendous disad-
vantage in the matter of manufactures as compared with
Melbourne. At present no one who proposes to manu-
facture for the Australian market on a large scale starts
business in Sydney unless he is a born lunatic. A person
who proposes making, say, machinery, naturally opens in
Melbourne, because he can then send his goods duty-free
over Victoria and New South Wales, there beinn- no tariff
on the New South Wales side of the border. From Mel-
bourne he gets access to the two most populous States
If he started in Sydney his goods could go duty-free over
New South Wales alone—he would onlv have the market
of one province instead of two—for the duty on the Vic-
torian side of the border blocks the way. Federation by
abolishing border duties, gives Sydney a show to become
a manufacturing city.
(14) Under the Braddon clause (No. 87) New South
Wales is guaranteed three-fourths of her own customs
and excise revenue for her own separate use.
(15) New South Wales shifts its postal deficit-
over £70,000 a year —on to the broad shoul-
ders of the Commonwealth. It gets the help
of the rest of Australia to defend it from in-
vasion. It will probably save £250,000 a year at the
very least in interest when the Federal Government
takes over and consolidates the public debts, for the
Federal Government will be able to borrow at a cheaper
rate than any single State. It will save further because
there will be only one Agent-General, military com-
mander and Postmaster-General instead of six of each
Also it will save the cost of its border customs establish
ments.
(16) It will be, by virtue of its population, one-thira
boss of all Australia instead of whole boss of one-tenth of
Australia.
* * * •
(17) It will have a share in absolutely the most demo-
cratic Constitution on this earth.
(a) There will be equal State representation in the
Senate (clause 7) a system which the experience of 14 out
of 16 existing Federations has proved to' be workable and
desirable.
(b) Both Houses will be elected by the people (clauses 8,24
30 and 41) on the One-Man-One-Vote principle, under the’
widest suffrage existing anywhere on this earth. Senators
will not be nominated for life as in Canada ; or elected by
State Legislatures as in the U.S. and most of the Spanish-
American Federations, or appointed by the State Minis-
tries as iti Germany, or appointed on no fixed plan as in
Switzerland.
(c) The Senate can be dissolved (clause 57) if it comes
in collision .with the popular will, and it will be the only
Federal Senate on earth which can be shifted at any time
by dissolution.
(d) The Senate can also (clause 57) be suppressed by
the vote of the House of Representatives in a Joint Sit-
ting. The Joint Sitting is a sure remedy for deadlocks
and as the House of Representatives will muster twice as
many votes as the Senate it controls the situation. The
Senate has, therefore, no veto. In every other Federa-
tion the Senate has a veto, and can block legislation per-
manently.
(e) Senators will be paid, and there is no property
qualification whatever. (Clauses 16 and 48). The Federal
Senate will be as truly a People's House as the House
of Representatives.
(f) The Senate is not allowed to originate or amend
Money Bills (Clause 53). In Switzerland, the United
States, and almost all other Federations, the Senate can
deal with Money Bills as it pleases.
(g) Also the Federal Constitution can be amended
(Clause 128) by the vote of both Houses or even of one
House, coupled with the assent of a majority of the
people voting at a Referendum and a majority of the
States. No other Federation in the world has so liberal a
system of amendment. In Switzerland it is necessary to

avoids the rook on which the United States Constitution
split. The white majority of New South Wales, Victoria,
and South Australia can put out its great horny hand
and squash the mongrel of North Queensland, and the
nigger-labor proclivities of Western Australia, and the
flourishing Chinaman of Tasmania. Even if Queensland
and Western Australia are not in the Federation now
they will be in it soon enough. And the North Queens-
land nigger and the Tasmanian Chow are matters of all-
Australian interest. For if they snatch employment from
the Queensland and Tasmanian white man, the latter is
driven thereby to swell the overcrowded labor markets of
the other provinces.
The present Bill offers all these things now.
But there is no guarantee that, if they are re-
jected—merely because the Bill doesn’t provide
for the capital being in Sydney, and it will cost
the Daily Telegraph =B5OOO a year to get its
Federal Parliamentary reports wired from Goul-
burn or Bombala or Armidale—the chance will
come back. However often a chance may come
there is some time when it makes its very last ap-
pearance. This may be the last time —or it may not.
Australia can’t keep for ever in a fever over one
abortive Federal scheme after another. It has
had five years of it now, and that Tired Feeling
must supervene sometime, and then the country
will want a protracted rest. And one thing is
certain: Looking at all the constitutions of the
world, and considering how slowly and painfully
they have been evolved, it is 100 chances to 1 that
Australia won’t get a better one than that now
offered —not even if she waits till the year 2500.
The fac,t that every bitter Tory—every Dibbs and
Pilcher, and Heydon and MacLauhin, and all
the old M’sL.C., and the magnates of the Colonial
Sugar Refining Co., and Fossildom in general—is
against it is the best possible guarantee that Aus-
tralia should reach out for it with both hands, and
hang on to it afterwards.
The “Loss of Trade” Bogey.
A very quaint and lop-sided and upside-down
argument advanced by the Sydney Provincialist
clan is to the effect that Australian union will
lead to the loss of the Riverina trade, which is
to he absorbed in the capacious maw of Mel-
bourne. Also, it is to lead to the loss of the
western trade, which is to go to Melbourne or'
Adelaide ; and other grievous spooks and gob-
lins and things are to happen. This apparition
is all the more weird because it is obvious to
any intelligent person who considers the situa-
tion that N.S. W. has long ago lost the Riverina
and western trade ; and that it can’t lose
through Federation what it has already lost
without Federation ; and that, having been de-
prived of its southern and western commerce,
largely through the old policy of disunion, the
idea of recommending continued disunion as a
means to retain the thing that is already gone,
is an absurdity. But there are so many
absurdities in the bright lexicon of parochialism
that one more doesn’t matter,
* * * *
The Riverina and the West export wool,
hides, and live and dead meat, and very little
e^se - nearest ports are Melbourne,
Augusta, and Adelaide, and as Vic o
and South Australia charge no duty on w °
and hides > Ule y g° fc ° th f
ports. Much more tlian one-fourth of N.»- •
bales’ wool is exported via Melbourne anc
Adelaide> and of things has existed
practically ever since there was any Riverina
at aIL This trade has always been lost and
tbe anti-Federal crowd which implores N.S. V\ .
to reiect Federation for fear of being deprived
of wllat ib hasn,t S ob is a premeditated ass.
d 'he trade can’t be any more lost than lt is now.
There is absolute Freetrade in wool and hides
on the border now, and Federation can’t make
•*. r
lb a ny freer.
** * .
But Federation, instead of losing over again
>. v aniS h«i »ai
ce rtainly fetch a lot of it back. If hew
South Wales accepts the Bill which IS now
offered to it, it will recover much of the
R'verm. and Western trade that now goes to
Melbourne, and it is only by Federation or some
other form of union that it can do so. If Aus-
bralia federates, and there areno southern border
dubies on wool i &c - (j usb as is bhe case nQW )?
the wool exports will have a tendency to go to
the nearest port (just as they do now). There-
f°re from Junee soubhward the business will
a f wa ys incline more or less Melbourne-wards
(just" as it does now). But there will be this
immense difference. Then Melbourne can only
hope to get the trade of those districts which
lie nearer to that city than to Sydney. Now
in the disunited state of things Melbourne not
only gets that trade, but it also reaches out for
the trade of about another half of N.S. W.
besides. How that reach-out is effected is
shown on the accompanying map. Over a vast
portion of the west of N.S.W. right up to the
Queensland border, the Victorian railway de-
partment offers the N.S. W. wool-growers from
46 to 61 per cent, discount off the usual railway
freights on condition that they send their wool
to Melbourne. Over a vast area of central
N.S. W., almost to the back-door of Brisbane, it
offers reductions as high as 66 per cent.—a dis-
count of over 13s. in the £—as an inducement
to the N.S. W. wool-grower to send his wool to
Melbourne. Over an extensive border-district
in N.S.W. the Victorian railways give dis-
counts ranging from 38 to 46 per cent. The
trade doesn’t pay Victoria at these rates—in
fact, it is a dead loss—still the Southern pro
vince keeps up the fight, and a vast amount of
business, which, but for these freight-discounts,
would come to Sydney, goes to the Yarra-bank
city instead.
* * * *
If the Federal Bill is accepted, the Common-
wealth Parliament, in which N.S.W. will have
the loudest voice, has power to stop this form
of competition absolutely. According to clauses
101 and 103 :
The Parliament may, by any law of trade or commerce
forbid, as to railways, any preference or discrimination
by any State. . . .
Nothing in this Constitution shall render unlawful any
rate for the carriage of goods upon a railway, the pro-
perty of a State, if the rate is deemed by the Inter-State
Commission to be necessary for the development of the
State, AND if the rate applies equally to goods within
the State and to goods passing into the State from other
States.
The Victorian 66 per cent, reductions on
N.S.W. wool are not for the development of
Victorian territory ; also, they don’t apply to
Victorian wool. Therefore they are ruled out
under both headings, and over fully one-third
of N.S.W. the present ruinous Victorian com-
petition is almost certain to cease. In the
purely-border districts the competition will
still continue, but even there it will be better
for N.S.W. than it is now, for even in the dis-
tricts that are nearer to Melbourne than to
Sydney the Victorian freight-discounts go as
high as 46 per cent., and their abolition will give
N.S.W. a greatly improved chance. It will then
simply be a case of freetrade in wool on the
border. Now it is a case of freetrade with
huge Victorian bonuses to aggravate the case.
Therefore the change will be wholly in favor of
New South Wales.
» ♦ * *
In addition to this, Federation will abolish
the Victorian border tax on N.S.W. cattle and
sheep, and give the N.S.W. grower a market
which is now practically closed to him ; and,
again, the Riverina will gain trade which is at
present lost to it. All this means more busi-
ness for N.S.W., more railway traffic, more
prosperity, more employment and a chance of
better wages for the railway workers. And
even this is nob all. The South Queensland


work and wages for the rail-
mfddlememy^Qiieensland^has o partl l ally
ptr t 1 ueeiisland"wooVjj 3 rn £
border southward ; Federation will abolish this
border duty and give the trade a fair chance to
come back again. Both on the north and south
N S W has lost commerce through disunion,
and it 'is only by union that it can hope to get
it back. , • •
It is commonly reported that the railway-
men of N.S.W. are going to give a block-vote
against Federation, under a dark suspicion that
it will smother the inland carrying industry of
Cornstalk Land, and the grass will grow and
the goats graze on the railways of that pro-
vince, and the cows will chew the forsaken loco-
motive, and everybody will be sacked. In
other words, that they are actually going to
vote for a continuance of the system whereby
Queensland shuts its commerce off the N.S.VV.
railways by a huge export duty, and Victoria
snatches the wool-trade away almost from the
back-door of Sydney by its policy of 66 per
cent, discounts. If they are going to do so it
will be their own funeral, and the said funeral
ought to be one of the biggest spectacles of its
kind that Australia has yet seen.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Billjim’s Sayso.
Opposition to the Biff in the country districts, especially
among the farmers, is daily growing stronger.—Sydney
Telegraph’s Say-so.
We noticed when the Geebung crowd commenced
this “Anti’’fuss
It was “keep the trade in Sydney!” and they
never mentioned us;
And the sort of trade they howled about was
mostly silks and “ jools ”
As if Australia lived on Dukes and other useless
fools
Who “provide the poor employment” with the
cash the workers earn,
And give those high-toned sprees for which your
jumped-up tradesmen yearn.
We could have no Federation and the Bush might
shut its mouth
If the rag-trade and the flunkeys with the Capital
went South;
Then the Bush cried, “Blank the Capital—we’re
striving to be free ! ”
(That Blank is only meant to read as “blanksby,
M.L.C.)
But, as I’ve said, the bush man cried—“ We’re
striving to be free
To buy and sell with whom we choose, and end
this tyranny
That shuts us out from road or rail no matter how
we plead
Unless the route can only serve one bloated city’s
greed.”
Then Geebungs said, “We’ll have to drop the
George-street trading ‘push,’
And ready-up some ‘facts ’ to scare these hayseeds
in the bush.”
Yes, its “ hayseeds ” when the season’s good and
Sydney’s doing grand,
But it’s ‘ ‘ backbone of the country ” when a drought
is on the land;
And the dog-hooks in your warehouses are rusting
in the wall,
For there’s little going westward and nought com-
ing in at all.
And so they thought of us at last, and set their
largest type
To scare the country yokels into helping them to
fight.
They “took a plough ” and figured out some awful
tommy-rot,
And tracked that plough from London (!) till it
struck the “Braddon Blot.”
O ! the price was something fearful, but it only
made us laugh,
For you can’t snare even country birds with any
sort of chaff.
The Telegraph plays “ all it knows, ” and prints
with deep intent
Poor Brunker’s ancient “bloomer” re that
twenty-seven per cent.—
Which raised a roar of laughter from the Gulf to
Twofold Bay ;
Yet it’s gravely quoted now to scare the yokels up
at Hay.
We know the fatman doesn’t fight to guard his
cherished loot:
We know it’s in our cause he plays his patriotic
flute ;
We know it’s for the toilers that he holds a fight-
ing brief,
While the sorrows of the settlers make his blubber
shake with grief.
That good old “struggling settler” who is always
kept in sight
As a war-cry for the Fatman when he’s got a tax
to fight;
Still, we’re grateful for his figures in this Federa-
tion fix,
And we ain’t at all alarmed about that twenty-
two-and-six.
“ This Bill will kill the farmers, ” cry the Gee-
bungs while they weep.
Yes—“ a dingo tax will ruin you,” says the dingo
to the sheep.
So, bushmen, throw your mittens down and fight
for all you’re worth,
For the wilds you toil to conquer and the land
that gave you birth,
And though the Geebungs boast about the country
“turning round,”
By the Refer-blanky-rendum we will prove the
bush is sound!
Cripps Clark.
More Conventional Lies and Other
Things of the Disunion Party.
Since the article “Conventional Lies of the
anti-Federal Party ” was published on 20th
May, The Bulletin has come upon a few more
notable inaccuracies of the Disunited Australia
party. Samples herewith :
“Mr. Cook had said recently that N.S.W.
retained all her railways, lands, and rivers.
But these lands and railways and rivers could
all be taken from this colony, even though
every N.S. W. elector voted ‘No.’” — Hungry
Higgins, the Victorian lawyer, imported by the
N.S. W. Disanionists, as reported in Sydney
Telegraph.
The Federal Biff distinctly enacts that no State’s rail-
ways can be taken by the Federal Government except
with the State’s consent, and on terms agreed upon by
both parties (clause 51, section 33). The Biff gives no
power to take away either rivers or lands, and how do
ylib take away a river, anyhow? The Bulletin charitably
assumes that the man who talks about taking away
the rivers is a trifle demented. And Higgins demands a
Federal Constitution which can be altered in any way by
a bare majority vote-a Constitution under which Vic-
toria S A., and Queensland could take N.S.W.’s railways,
even though every N.S.W. elector voted “No” The
thing which Higgins says is wrongfully in the Bill is really
the thing which Higgins is trying to put in it because he
says it is right.
When the tug-of-war between the two Houses
came, both would have equal powers with re-
gard to money-bills. The Senate would win in
nearly every case, because it had a more per-
manent tenure . . . and because the Senate
could not be dissolved except in the extremely
rare case of a double dissolution.— More
Higgins.
The Biff provides distinctly, in clause 53, that the two
Houses shall not have equal powers re money-bills—that
the Senate can neither originate nor amend them. And
it provides, in clause 57, that there may be a dissolution
of both Houses any time when the tug-of-war comes. The
country has only' Higgins’s bare word that the double
dissolution will lie “ extremely rare,” or that the Senator,
with perhaps a six years’ tenure of his salary before him,
will be so anxious to risk losing it by a dissolution that
he will always want to fight the Lower House. The
security of Higgins’s word isn’t good enough.
There is a land-booming crowd in Melbourne
prepared to subscribe £1,000,000 to keep the
capital in Melbourne for even five years.— The
howl of foolish old Dibbs, as reported in the
Telegraph.
If Dibbs knows this he must know something about the
crowd—the names of some at least of its members or the
names of the persons they are going to give the million
to, or something. Will he, as a truthful and honorable
Chicago-damner, who wouldn’t say such a thing without
good evidence (being aware that to do so would be a vile
slander and calculated to make every honest citizen want
to kick the utterer thereof)—will he furnish his evidence?
People sometimes asked him why he was so
suspicious of the other colonies. He replied
they had sold this colony three or four times,
bub never, as long as he breathed, would he
allow them unquestioned to sell the colony
again as they had done before.— Gentleman
R. Dibbs (Telegraph report).
Again, will the ex-Republican who took a title, and the
ex-Freetrader who became leader of the Protectionist
party, and the alleged curser of the Great Pork City,
state, as an honest, accurate man should, when and how
the “ other colonies ” sold N.S. W. ?
It seemed to be a most extraordinary process
of repudiation which was proposed by this Bill.
He referred to the public works, which were
built by borrowed money, and which would be
taken over by the Federal Treasurer. Imme-
diately Federation was brought about, that
Minister would take over the Custom houses of
the different colonies, for which they would
compensate the States. We had £60,000,000
of borrowed money in public buildings, and yet
these would be taken over, though they did not
belong to the States. They stood as security
to the creditors of the State. An unscrupulous
Treasurer could appropriate money that did not
belong to him, and let the creditors whistle for
their security. —G. R. Dibbs.
Yet, according to Cogiilan’s “Seven Colonies” for
1897-98 (page 410), all the borrowed money that all the
six Australian States have invested in roads, bridges,
harbors, public buildings, defence works and sundries is
about £28,000,000, and £14,000,000 of that is in roads,
bridges, and harbors which the Commonwealth won’t
take over. The £60,000,000 invested in buildings that are
to be taken over is really only about £5,000,000 at the
outside.
This Bill is simply a Chinese copy of the
American Constitution. Wild yell from Dibbs.
Which is doubtless why the Senate is to be elected by
the people, while in the U.S. it is nominated by the State
Legislatures; why it is dissolvable, while the U.S. one
isn’t; why it can be suppressed by the Lower House at a
Joint Sitting, while there is no joint Sitting in the U.S.
Constitution ; why the Australian Senate can’t amend
money biffs, while' the U.S. one can; and why the Aus-
tralian Constitution can be amended with the assent of
one House and a bare majority of the people voting and
of the States, while in the U.S. it requires a two-thirds
majority of each House and the assent of three-fourths
of the States.
There will be six paid Parliaments and a
Federal paid Parliament, or altogether 680
paid politicians.— Daily Telegraph.
There are at present 425 paid politicians in the six
Australias—l2s in N.S.W. ; 95 in Victoria ; 72 in Queens-
land ; 78 in S. A. ; 55 in Tasmania. The addition of 110
Federal politicians to the 425 already existing makes 680
—in the Telegraph’s insane arithmetic. Heaven only
knows how the other 145 politicians were invented.
The advocates of this Bill were all interested
in getting it through while the anti-Bill party
had no personal ends to serve.— Language
ascribed to Dibbs by the Daily Telegraph.
The Bulletin can hardly imagine that even foolish, old
Dibbs could say so wild a thing as that, but whether he
said it or it was said for him, it is a mean and miserable
slander. All the thousands of people who are for the
Biff can’t have personal ends to serve —there isn’t boodle
enough to go round. And if the £5OOO a year which it
will cost the Telegraph to get its parliamentary news
from a distant capital doesn’t give it an end to serve —
well, what is an end ? This certificate of the anti-Federal
party to the effect that it has known itself for a long
time" and can certify to its own spotless integrity is very
beautiful.
The Bill is a negation of the principles our
forefathers have fought for for centuries.—
M‘Gowen, leader of N.S. W. Labor-party.
This isn’t put in as one of the “ Conventional Lies; ” it
merely got here by accident. All The Bulletin desires
to say is that if M'Gowen’s forefathers fought against
having both Houses elected by the people under one-
man-one-vote, with • no property qualification and all
members to be paid, then they were a bad, disreputable
lot, and it is to be hoped they were killed in the fight.
Such forefathers are much better dead.
The Colonial Sugar Co. and Federation.
The Colonial Sugar Company has issued its
Threat to the Clarence River Farmers. If
there is Federation, and the sugar-duty goes
up, the co. will reduce the price of cane by ss.
or 6s. per ton. Are not the Clarence River
farmers tired of living under the tyranny
of the Colonial Sugar Co. ? The Colonial
Sugar Co. is an enormous syndicate with
£1,702,000 paid-up capital and £419,000
reserve-funds ; and its £2O shares are quoted
buyers £3B 12s. 6d. It has plantations
and refineries in N.S. Wales, in Queensland,
and in Fiji. In Queensland and Fiji it employs
black and yellow labor. In N.S. Wales it has
a white face, and says it discourages the colored
man. And the N.S. Wales sugar-grower is
squashed flat under the Colonial Sugar Co.’s big
thumb.
The Colonial Sugar Co. has a practical
monopoly of sugar-manufacture in N.S. Wales.
There are great tracts of country on the N.S. W.
Northern rivers suitable for the cultivation of
cane, but not an acre must be put in without
the co.’s permission. If it is put in, it can rot
on the fields before it is crushed. The co. has
a monopoly ; and that’s the end of things. The
sugar-farmer can take its terms or leave them ;
but if he leaves them he quits sugar-farming.
The Colonial Sugar Co. is a monopolist, and
it uses its monopoly. When Premier Reid
talked of taking the sugar-duty off, the com-
pany threatened to close its mills and ruin the
industry. It was supposed to undertake, if
the £3 per ton duty was kept on, to pay the
same price for cane as before the duty was in-
terfered with. Does it pay that price ? Some
of the sugar-growers say No ; but they do not
say it loudly, or the co. might refuse to crush
their cane.
What will Federation do for the Colonial Sugar
Co. ’ Probably these things : It will keep out
its Fijian black-labor sugar —of which 1712 tons
were imported last year—by a heavy protective
tariff which will correspondingly benefit the
white N.S.W. farmer. Federation may mean
State assistance —as in Victoria ; or central
mills built by Govt., as in Queensland. The
Colonial Sugar Co. does not want State assist-
ance to help the small grower to defy
ics monopoly. It does not want cen-
tral mills to break up its monopoly. If,
after Federation, any bonus is given to the
sugar-industry in Queensland or Victoria, the
same bonus must be given to the industry in
N.S. Wales. And Federation, sooner or later,
means the death-knell of black labor. No
wonder the Colonial Sugar Company, which
lives and thrives and pays dividends on black
labor, does not want Federation.
A singular thing is the number of share-
holders in the Colonial Sugar Company who are
uncompromising opponents of Federation —no
doubt on patriotic grounds, entirely unconnected
with the possible destruction of the co. ’s N.S. W.
monopoly and the loss of some of its black-
labor dividends. Dr. MacLaurin’s 150 shares
in the co., for example, are worth at current
market prices precisely £5793 15s. These
gentlemen are the innocent victims of a coinci-
dence which nobody regrets more than them-
selves. For G. Dibbs has assured us that
nobody on the anti-Bill side has any sordid
motive, and that everybody on the Federal side
has one.

The Anti-Federal Sugar Lie.
The Colonists’ Anti-Bill League they call
themselves colonists to distinguish them from
the other crowd who are Australians, and also,
perhaps, because their interests are so largely
bound up with those of that great nigger-labor’
industry, the Colonial Sugar Co.—has issued a
manifesto, with a very fine vein of Ananias in
it, to the N.S.W. sugar-growers :
You know where you are now ; where would you be
under this Federal Bill ? Queensland is said to be coming-
in, and, of course, you would have to compete with her
cheaper colored labor and superior climate on level terms.
Now you have a £3 per ton protection against her sugar.
Queensland is now your chief competitor. She now sup-
plies more than one-half of the sugar consumed in Aus-
tralia ; in a few years she will probably supply the whole.
You are only able to compete with her now with the aid
of £3 a ton duty ; under the Bill you will lose this. This
means ruin.
But you may imagine you will get some compensation
from a higher import duty upon foreign sugars. You
will do no thing of the kind. It is quite true that there
will be a higher customs duty on foreign sugars, but there
will also be an excise duty upon locally grown sugar.
That is to say, that if there is a £7 a ton customs duty
you will have to pay a £7 a ton excise duty on every ton
of sugar produced.
George Turner, Premier of Victoria, said this ; B. R.
Wise said it; Pulsford said it ; and, indeed, it is ridicu-
lous to suppose that the southern colonies, who will be in
the majority in the Federal Parliament, will consent to
allow you to escape without paying it; because the more
taxation you pay the less they need pay. Last week Sir
George Turner stated that the excise duty under Federa-
tion would be only £5, whilst the Customs duty would be
£7. Even if that be so, it amounts to no more than this :
That now you have a £3 per ton protection against all
competitors, including Queensland ; under the Federal
Bill you would have only £2 protection against foreign
sugar; against the bounty-fed beet sugar you would
have no protection—and no protection at all against
Queensland.
As a sugar-grower, you cannot afford to enter this
Federation. It spells absolute ruin to you.
The most notable points in this lie are these :
(1) The Commonwealth Bill gives the Federal Parlia-
ment power to suppress Queensland cheap colored labor.
(2) As the Federal Parliament doesn’t even exist yet no
one knows what duty it will put on imported sugar. Any
Colonists’ Association which says it knows what people
who are not yet elected to the Parliament which doesn’t
exist will do is a liar of a very poor order.
(3) Nobody knows that there will be any excise duty on
sugar, because the Parliament which has power to impose
it isn’t born yet.
(4) Neither Turner, Wise, nor Pulsford was so absurd
an ass as to prophesy what the Federal sugar-duty would
be. And if they had it wouldn’t have mattered. There is
no definite evidence that any of them will be in the
Federal Parliament at all. If they are they will only be
three men and can’t impose sugar-duties.
(5) And if the “southern colonies” put a duty of £7
per ton on the imported sugar they use, and £5 a ton on
the N.S.W. and Queensland sugar they use, they will
simply be raising the price of their own sugar by £5 a ton
and paying a fuff proportion of the duty themselves. And
the “ southern colonies,” having as great a desire to save
their cash as any northern colonies could have, are not
likely to do anything of the kind if they can help it.

“The Telegraph’s” Decomposed Infant.
Last week, just as the anti-Federal Sydney
Telegraph was on the top wave of its shriek
against the “ Secret Conference Bill,” and was
asserting for the thousandth time that it was a
true, pure, sincere Federationist, and wasn’t
fighting against union, but only objected to the
underhand manoeuvres of the Premiers’ Confer-
ence—it suddenly fell in. When it had partly
crawled out again and got the slush out of its
ear, it discovered that it was an object.of mirth
to all Australia, and a scoff and a jibe and a
by-word even to its own office-boy. The
trouble arose through a Sydney journalist—W.
B. Melville —digging this up from the D.T.
of 28th January, 1899 :
The proposal to hold the Premiers’ Federal Conference
in whispers, inaudible to the public, is one that ought to
be received with acclamation. Talk has been the bane
of the movement since its inception, and unless the tribu-
lation comes soon to an end, in the interests of public
sanity it will be necessary to declare a “ close season ” of
at least 25 years, during which any reference to the great-
ness of Australia’s destiny, or the crimson thread of kin-
ship, or the nascent nation ’neath the Southern Cross,
will be made an indictable offence. Meanwhile, those
who have the matter in hand can go away to some quiet
place, decide in a business-like way about what they pro-
pose to do, and submit the plain result to the people,
who will express their opinion thereon by a straight
“ yes ” or “ no.” Had that course been adopted at the
start, before the “ orator ” got his greasy paw in the
Federation pie, the whole question would have been
settled long ago.
That appeared in the Telegraph the very
morning when the much-cursed “ Secret Con-
ference ” commenced its sittings ! ! The infer-
ence, of course, is that the Telegraph, being
anti-Federal all along right down- to its boot-
soles, sooled the Premiers on to hold their
Conference in secret in order that it might
make out of the event a handy anathema for
after use. That importers’ organ now pro-
ceeds to Explain with rather less than its
usual agility—with rather a gouty jump, in
fact. It says that the demand was made in
the column which is signed by the pen-name of
a member of its staff, and therefore the paper
isn’t responsible. Yet the communication
wasn’t a letter (it is always understood that a
paper isn’t responsible for letters, not even for
those which it writes to itself). It was the
work of the Telegraph’s own leader-writer; the
work which he is paid to do, and which is passed
by the editor as correct and suitable —so the
Telegraph is now crying that it isn’t responsible
for the work of its own staff published in its
own columns ! Which is a truly pathetic effort
to pass along the late lamented infant. The
remains of that baby-paragraph have been
found in a lamentable state under the D.T.’s
bed, and as the sail I paragraph was last seen
alive in the D.T.’s possession some four months
ago it seems natural to call on it for an ex-
planation. One thing in particular casts a
gloom on this struggle to get rid of the infant.
The gentleman who signs himself “Ootis”
writes to say that he was solely responsible for
advocating a Secret Conference in the Tele-
graph of 28th January, and that he is still of
the same opinion. And in the Telegraph of
22nd April the same “ Ootis ” declared :
The only wonder is that the leader of the swamping
brigade (in N.S.W. Council), nearly every one of whom
has already declared the Enabling Pull to be a delusion
and a snare, did not move to have it immediately con-
signed to the waste-basket, and Mr. Reid impeached for
CONDUCTING A PRIVATE AUCTION SALE OF NEW SOUTH WALES
without liceense. Something of this would probably
have occurred if the session had lasted long enough for
them to get the correct hang of matters, but, as it was,
the demonstration of their after-the-poll independence
had to be postponed till another time.
So the same “ Outis ” who advocated the Secret
Conference in the Telegraph was one of the
first to denounce it in the same paper ! Which
makes another infant under the bed to be
accounted for.
Shoddy Versus Australia.
The cry that “ Free trade is in danger” is
beginning to make itself heard very loudly
amid the general babel of the anti-Billious.
The ever-useful Telegraph declares that it is
sincerely Federal at heart, but is against this
Bill because it is liable to “ stifle Freetrade ”
and thereby injure the German importers in
Sydney—almost all Sydney importers are Ger-
mans. Dibbs, avowed Protectionist, ex-leader
of the N.S.W. Protectionist party, and Protec-
tionist ex-Premier, cries to the people that
Freetrade is in danger under this iniquitous
Bill, and Dibbs also says that the only genuine
germ of Federation is concealed in that long
figure which enables him to establish an alibi
by turning sideways. And the Sunday Shell-
back (it also claims to be pure Federalist at
heart) publishes dreary calculations about the
“price of a gun,” or of a suit of clothes, and such
imported things when “this Bill” has brought
about Protection—its theory being that the
N.S.W. people are such a poor, foolish, ignor-
ant lot that the idea of them ever learning how
to make their own gun or their own tweed
is too absurd to be thought of. The point
which is worth considering here is that
all these people are anti-Federalists, pure
and simple, and that the issue they raise is
not whether we should reject this Bill for the
sake of imported shoddy, but whether we will
reject Federation for its sake. It is Shoddy
versus the Nation, and the German importers in
Sydney versus the whole future of Australia.
No civilised community ever devised a scheme
by which a country can be under one Govern-
ment and yet run six diverse tariffs—by which
there can be one solid nation, yet fenced off by
customs barriers at every State boundary.
Nobody has devised any scheme of Australian
union which doesn’t involve a uniform tariff.
The only way an Australian union can be
effected is by N.S.W. joining with the five
Protectionist provinces. N.S.W. keeps asking
the five Protectionist provinces to join her.
And when one Freetrade State (with a strong
Protectionist minority) persuades five Protec-
tionist States to join her it assures Freetrade
within Australia, but, of course, Freetrade with
the outer world is in danger. It always will be
under any Bill while these circumstances last.
Freetrade may come out on top, but it
must take the risk or there will be no
union. And the crowd which demands
that “ this Bill ” shall be rejected because it
puts Freetrade in danger must demand that
every Bill shall be rejected for the same
reason. They are anti-Federalists, pure and
simple, and the people who follow them are
not voting to reject this chance of union, but
to reject every chance, for they can’t make a
union out of existing materials without en-
dangering external Freetrade. They have
to choose between their beloved shoddy and
the interests of the'mostly-German importing
firms of Sydney on one side, and the
future Australian nation on the other, and
they may not even get the shoddy if they
decide for it, because Freetrade is in serious
danger at every election even in N.S.W.
itself. And it is no earthly good saying that
N.S.W. should wait till it can get some further
special concessions in return for the possible
surrender of the blessings of Freetrade. The
logical reply of the other provinces is that they
don’t regard Freetrade as a blessing, and that
they might as reasonably ask special conces-
sions in return for endowing N.S.W. with the
blessings of Protection. Also, if N.S.W.
chooses, by addressing the Protectionist pro-
vinces-with constant appeals for union, to put
her Freetrade policy in danger, it is her own
exclusive affair. So the clear-cut issue is—the
chance of a little imported calico versus the cer-
tainty of an Australian nation. And that issue
goes to the people on the 20th of this month.

The “ Wolves-and-Robbers ” cry should
appeal least of all to the coal-miners of N.S.W.,
who cannot have forgotten Victoria’s splendid
response to the appeal after the Bulli colliery
disaster, when over ,£lO,OOO was collected'in the
sister province for the distressed families. Pros-
perous and magnificent N.S.W. however did forget
at the time of the Creswick (Vic.) mining accident,
a few years back.

After all the cackle on the subject, this is the
stage to which Sydney has got on the inspec-
tion of-meat question :
Diseased Mutton.—lnspector Raker, of the Citv Council,
yesterday applied to Mr. G. H. Smitiibrs, S.M., at the
Central Police Court, for an order for the ooudeninaiion
and destruction of five carcases of mutton, unfit for
hitman food, owing to them being infected ivith abscesses.
Dr. G WYNNE- Hug mbs had examined the meat, and certi-
fied that it was unfit for human consumption. The car-
oases were seized at a whole-ale butcher’s at Darling
Harbor. Mr. Smititkrs made the order as requested. Mr.
Da vvson, the city solicitor, remarked that the inspection
at the abattoirs was inadequate, and the exposure of
diseased meat for sale was assuming alarming propor-
tions, the seizures being of almost daily occurrence. Mr.
S.mitiiers said that it was a public scandal that meat
should be allowed to leave the abattoirs in such a disgust-
ing condition. Public interest was being aroused over
the question of diseased meat, and it was to be hoped
that it wouVd lead to a reform of the present system of
inspection at abattoirs.

Extended acquaintance with the “ Liars ”
—Jones’s Liars at Sydney Royal—doesn’t increase
The Bulletin’s respect for them personally,
though it does for the pleasant little play as a
whole. There isn’t one among them who could
lie plausibly enough to persuade anybody that
Federation will cost every N.S.W. citizen 225. fid.,
or even 4|d. As for Jones’s heroine, she is also
unsatisfactory in a way, but that isn’t Jones’s
fault—the heroine is a real flesh and blood female,
and for her unsatisfactoriness Nature is respon-
sible. She is a butterfly lady with a large, stern
husband whom she goads to the verge of madness
by her flirtations. Certair large cracks are
beginning to appear in her reputation, and when
kind friends .remonstrate with her she merely
laughs a rippling defiant laugh and takes another
running kick at her reputation to enlarge the
cracks. Then she goes a step too far, and when
she is dining secretly with the other man at a
riverside hotel, and joyfully knocking the frag-
ments of social decorum all over the place, a well-
known head with a long inquiring nose gazes at
her through the doorway. All her giddy bravery
drops from her right there. She wilts like Noah’s
dickey in the Deluge, and her knees smite each
other in terror, so that if anyone tried to balance
a jug of water on either of them it would inevita-
bly fall off. And she says that she is Lost. She
implores seven friends to swear that she wasn’t
really alone with the other man, and they present
their confused alibi to the husband, who casts it
aside as if it were a serpent. So the poor woman
confesses and is forgiven, and bein'* forgiven she
leaves the friends who had lied so thoughtfully on
her behalf to fry in their shame. Her abject
collapse in the first place and her base ingratitude
to the kindly liars in the second are the most
conspicuous spots in her character. The utter
incompetence of the liars themselves is also
remarkable. Miss Evelyn Martheze is put forward
as the principal witness, and she stares straight
ahead of her with the haggard eye of one who sees
a ghost, and tells her tale in the monotonous voice
of a small boy reciting his alphabet while he looks
at nothing. Miss Martheze is a good feature in
the cast, and the other good features were all
mentioned last week.

The revival of “Dr. Bill” at Sydney
Opera House sets one thinking of the great change
that has come over comedy in the last few years.
The present writer is bald but not old, yet “Dr.
Bill ” comes to him like a whiff out of the grave of
back ages. There was a time when the desire of
every writer of comedy was to have four rooms
opening off the stage, and concealed in each room
two people whose characters would be wrecked if
anyone knew they were in, and also if they were
seen coming out, and who had to get out because if
they didn’t arrive home immediately they would
be socially lost and become Flossies and co-
respondents. Then on the stage he placed the
enraged husband who mustn’t either find these
people in or see them coming out, and the fainting
woman who was responsible for the whole trouble,
and who asserted in the face of all sense and
evidence that all these eight people were only the
cat. When the cat was found dozing on the hearth-
rug she used to say they were the new cat. Then,
having carefully built up this situation, the play
was left to run riot. “ Dr. Bill ”is a good old
comedy of this olden style, with a special streak
of demoniac ingenuity it it. The key of the room
in which the two people are fast losing their
characters is dropped down the back of the faint-
ing lady, and, as she can’t be publicly undressed,
or inverted and the key shaken out of her, and
the people who look down her back can’t find it,
and it refuses to fall out when she jumps, and she
is afraid to go away and undress for fear some
new complications will happen in her absence,
there is a deadlock. “Dr. Bill” is a kind
of comedy for which there is little demand
nowadays. Nobody writes plays with the four
doors and the eight concealed people now, and,
though it is a pleasure to see the old-old joke
again, one only wants to see it occasionally.
“Dr. Bill” is done in very respectable style,
especially so far as the ladies of the co. are con-
cerned. Misses Minna Phillips, Medway, and
Hilda Fraser are all bright spots on the pro-
gramme, the first-named especially; and W. J.
Montgomery makes a reasonably good Dr. Bill.
Some of the other men on the list are hereby
requested to consider themselves dead, but they
are persons of limited importance, and their fail-
ings don’t seriously injure the cheerful riot of old
familiar “Bill.”

“ Three Musketeers,” at Sydney Cri.,
isn’t so badly in want of a new D’Artagnan as it
was when this paper cried out for that fresh
musketeer last week. The untidy-looking old-
voung man, who arrives on the greeny-yellow
horse from Gascony, knows his part a good deal
better than on the first night, in consequence
whereof the curse is partly withdrawn. He
doesn’t look the reckless boy - swordsman any
better than he did, but he certainly speaks him
better. Miss Wheeler’s snow-white shoulder with
the brand on it has been a steady draw all
the week, and Miss W. herself has risen greatly
in public estimation by her rendering of Milady.
She throws herself into the part with the abandon
of a bad woman who is proud of her fine appear-
ance and her sins and her clothes, and does a great
deal to make up for the woodenness of the Cardinal
and the sourness of Louis the Just. That monarch
looks all the time as if he had just eaten a large
green apple.

C. Holloway will probably run his military
drama for another week or two, if the Lyceum
doasn’t fall bodily into Pitt-street in the interim.
For C. Holloway, in his yearning after realism,
lets off such deafening explosions in the battle-
scene that the house totters on its foundations,
and almost anything is liable to happen. Then he
winds up with the holy calm of a great tableau
showing the scene after the battle, when the last nig-
ger is dead, and the last gun is silent, and the
deceased lie in heaps on the grass, and the white
man rests from his burden and pegs out the brown
man’s land. There must be 20,000 dead niggers in
that tableau—they appear to spread away as far as
eye can reach. And they have all been shot
decently and in order. A true picture, with the
nigger’s leg blown off and the promiscuous dog
running away with it, would be objectionable.

There is a new luminary at Sydney Tivoli,
in the shape of little baby Powers, with her song
about a lost bow-wow. Also, banjoist Hosea
Easton is still busy showing what a banjo can
really do. On Monday night he gave the “ Wash-
ington Post March ” and the “ Old Folks at
Home, ” and even in this irreverent country, where
the old man at home is only a “bloke,” the latter
moaning refrain always moves Nipper and
Ginger to deep emotion. Manuel Woodson, the
silver streak of perpetual motion, is fearful to
see. The things he does, and the rapidity
with which he does them, are beyond description.
Manuel is at his weirdest, however, when he turns
himself inside out and, drawing his toes over his
shoulders, rolls round the stage ; and also when he
stands on two chairs, bends backwards, and seizes
from the floor with his teeth a glass of wine, which
he drinks as he turns a somersault, swallows him-
self, and vanishes in an indescribable whirl.
Richard H. Douglas does good work in a clever
skit of the modern pantomime, but the three
Keziahs, hanging by one toe among them from a
great height, are the biggest thrill of the pro-
gramme. Three pretty girls in mortal danger are a
source of much sympathetic interest to any proper
audience.

One or two new people are tilling their
respective lays at Melbourne I ij a, but the
principal novelty is a change in pro-
f ram me. The juggler has laid aside his hat and
is thin umbrella, also the coin that erstwhile
dropped like dew from Heaven into his out-'
stretched eye, and on Saturday he started to
gambol with vegetables and other household
wares. Having lashed a wash tub into fury
Cinquevalli sets it whirling on the leg of a chair,
which is balanced on the business end of
a broom the handle whereof revolves per-
pendicularly on his chin. This is a more imposing
spectacle than the potato trick, though the latter
is said to be one of the most difficult things
he has ever juggled, A double-edged knife, a
fork, and a potato fly about in the air, and the
end of their manoeuvres is two bits of ’tater im-
paled upon the knife in Cinquevalli’s hand, and a
third section of the ’tater sticking to the fork
under exceptional circumstances. After which he
flirts with the cannon-ball as usual.

The Haleck is closed again, and the last
of Allan’s Saturday afternoon concerts will happen
at the Town Hall on June 3. The big hall is a
cold place for ballads these times, and last Satur-
day an unbroken series of 15 items was allowed to
rush through without one encore. But when
Melbourne has got Amy Castles off its mind there
may be a fair chance of success for some more
chamber-music, such as Allan and Co. provided at
the Athenaeum Hall last winter.

Melbourne in general says so many unkind
things about “Forty Thieves ” at the Princess’s
that the present scribe feels rather disposed to look
for redeeming qualities in the Firm’s panto. It
gives employment for a hundred or more people on
the stage, it has one handsome ballet and some
gaudy tableaux effects, likewise the donkey is the
same excellent pantomimist (W. Hassan) who
helped to make a success for a brighter version of
“The Forty Thieves” in days of yore, when
Lonnen, Alice Lethbridge, and Snazelle were his
principal accomplices. Harry Shine (as Ali
Baba’s wife) would be about the most fetching low
comedian in this country if he had more ‘ ‘ breadth, ”
or magnetism, or “reserve force,” or something
which Shine lacks by comparison with less in-
telligently humorous patterers. And for others of
the company it may be said they are merely
a little smaller all round than what is expected
of them. They don’t come up to the theatre’s
reputation, and the burden of a dull “book” is
more than they can carry. Miss Carrie Moore—
’scuse the pun—promises to fill out into a first-
class principal boy, but she wants time, as the
horse-reporters remark of an “unfurnished ” filly.
Miss Vollugi is an artistio ballad-singer and an
attractive girl, but she seems too tired to make an
impression. Miss Rose Musgrove belongs to the
thin, genteel order of warblers, who strive in vain
to seem snappy; D. H. Caston has a sorrowful
tone of voice, and Geo. de Lara was never an
exciting detail. As for little Gulliver, he is a
vexed question—Sydney loves him dearly, but the
blue-chinned midget with the voice of a full-sized
fish-hawker has begun to pall upon his native Mel-
bourne. He amuses the children, no doubt, but
this is not Xmas time, and the children, as a rule,
are not taking any of the Firm’s spectacle.

Dante celebrates a jubilee on Friday of

1 lle silk handkerchief that passes into

features of Dante’s joyful entertainment, are well
worth seeing more than once. You can’t see the

about, because he is hidden behind a curtain, but
as a delusion and a fraud the ghostly Indian de-
serves every encouragement, nevertheless.

Bland Holt’s new drama prospers at the
Royal, and a generous public has seemingly
decided to overlook the heroine’s carelessness as
regards the corpse of her aged father. The old
man gets murdered shortly before his daughter
arrives upon the awful scene, but instead of rush-
ing into the next room where he has been left to
welter in his gore, she simply sits down
and takes the tragedy for granted. Amid the
turmoil of a carefully - mixed climax the
defunct baronet is forgotten by everybody,
including the villain who stabbed him from the
r ® ar - if the police were to inquire closely into
the matter, they would probably discover that the
neglected body isn’t dead at all, but the police are
too busy arresting perpetrators of the crime
to find a moment for assuring themselves that any
crime has taken place. “ How London Lives ”is
a thorough business success and a most instructive
lesson. It explains why Melbourne has little or
no use for plays that appeal to common-sense.
* * • »
In its own unnatural and beautifully-
mounted way, “How London Lives” is a good
acting drama, for some of the situations have a
surface of realism, and in these Miss Ross goes
one better—even two or three better —than usual.
Every now and then her elocution nearly breaks
into a canter, and her voice is raised half a tone,
and the elegant Miss R. almost loses a little of her
self-consciousness. If she will go further in these
directions, and make a point of starving in shabbier
clothes than she wears at present, the perform-
ance will be more than respectable. Bland Holt’s
own particular loudness is against him in the
domestic griefs of this narrative, but as the char-
acter is Happy Jack and the Royal audiences love
their Bland for his invariable Holtiness, he gets
there just the same. Miss Watson and Arthur
Styan play the orthodox guilty pair, and Albert
Norman, as the uninteresting husband, bolts from
his wife and child in a fairly forcible manner.
Norman’s four-year-old child would tend to drive
any father out into the cold world.

Melb. Age critic on Amy Castles and her
huge benefit-concert at Melb. Town Hall: —
The qualities of that glorious voice of hers, its round-
ness, its fulness, its richness and what not, have been de-
scanted on in these columns ; and, though in no sense did
we say anything beyond what the facts warranted, our
judgment in the matter has been impugned in some
quarters as going too far in the young lady’s praise. It is
quite clear that this view is not held by music-lovers in
general. The Town Hall was packed from end to end,
and every single soul in it had paid ss. for a seat.
Yes ; and about 80 per cent, of the souls came to
hear Amy on the strength of the notoriety which
had been created for her voice by a few people and
a number of circumstances. They applauded
what they were told was marvellous. As a testi-
mony to the merits of the singer’s voice, their
enthusiasm didn’t count. Had they paid one
shilling each three months ago for admission
to a popular concert in which the then
unknown Miss Castles was taking part, she might
have given them the same performances that they
got last week without receiving one genuine encore
for her trouble. In each of the pieces she sang
the other night her voice seemed soulless—large,
round, and fairly sweet, but not magnetic. She
didn’t make the audience rise at her. They rose
“on their own, ” because they had come thereto
rise. The cant of musical criticism had told
them to believe that Amy Castles will be a great
singer when she learns now to produce greatly
improved effects with her voice, and a couple of
thousand people in the Town Hall were content to
take a future probability on trust, and applaud it
as though it were an accomplished fact.
* • * *
The cant of musical criticism, in the
Castles case, was originally based upon misstate-
ments as to the age and education of the newly-
discovered voice. The Bulletin impugned not
the judgment of the Age critic, but the credi-
bility of certain rumors by which he and others
were misled. The Age man’s first notice of Amy
Castles said she was a growing girl whose voice
was to be all the more marvelled at on account of
its youth and inexperience. He presented the
damsel to the public as “little Miss Castles” with
her hair hanging down her back. Inasmuch as
The Bulletin said she was a young woman of re-
markable self-possession (which argued some prac-
tice in singing and frequent previous appear-
ances before the public). The Bulletin was
accused by Sydney Freeman’s Journal of
insulting “little Miss Amy Castles and her
‘modesty,’” as though there had been a
suggestion of immodesty in the matter. The Age
notice started from wrong premises, and The
Bulletin told the truth—that’s all. Miss Castles
will be 19 next month ; her voice has been persist-
ently trained for three or four years, otherwise it
wouldn’t be the big voice it is now, and the fact
that she neither sings artistically nor thrillingly at
present is somewhat of a satire on the predictions
of her future greatness. Her voice has been aptly
compared to that of De Yere Sapio, an accom-
plished singer, who came to Australia with
Madame Camille Urso. Where is Madame Sapio’s
celebrity, anyhow? She could do what it will
take Amy Castles a long time to learn to do ; she
had a platform appearance which the Bendigo
aspirant can never achieve, but her voice
lacked sympathy, and the fine-looking artist
has not broken any records. Granted that
Amy Castles has the voice of a Sapio,
and the patience, physique, intellect, and
strength of character necessary to the making
of a first-class artist—giving her credit for all
these things, she is still only a future Sapio on a
reduced scale of personal attraction. As the
heroine of a foolish “boom,” little Miss Castles
will be all the better for The Bulletin’s cold
douches of pure truth. If a confident platform
manner in a novice doesn’t indicate an absence of
“the artist nature as suggested in this cruel
journal—the lucky girl can put it down to our
ignorance. There aVe two ways of looking at the
characteristic in question, which is brought into
prominence by the juvenility of Miss Amy’s hair-
dressing. The Argus man reports that “the
young lady’s self possession is, however, as distinct
a gift as her voice.” Then why did the ram-
pageous Freeman’s Journal howl at an honest
record of one of the young lady’s gifts?

“Alba”: In the school of Art, playwright Jones is a
scholar—sometimes; in the school of Emotion, Jones is a
sinner—often. From the “Silver King” to “The Liars’*
is i>. leap-downward. Yet there are moments in “The
Liars” when a tear may. droop over the intellectual cheek,
only to be driven back by pieces of nnnecessarj' and m
pudent realism. In the “Star and Garter” act, when
Faulkner sobs out his heart to Lady Jessica, the author
seizes the moment to introduce a barrel-organ under the
window ; the effect is bewildering. Also, the logic of the
average audience is childlike. When Faulkner, the would-
be seducer of Lady Jessica, is bowled out, he turns to the
injured husband and damns him to eternity, while th«
audience applauds with large feet. When Lady Jessica
exclaims that she will fly to Africa with Faulkner, she
lifts the house. A few minutes later, when she leaves the
room in a spirit of penitence, holding hubby’s arm, the
audience cheers wildly. Audiences are . . . But that’s
another emotion.
Jennie Lee, at latest, was on the road to a big benefit
matinee, not such a gigantic ben. as fell to poor Nellie
Farren’s lot, but a “thousand-pounder” at least. The
“ Jo” Lee of 25 years ago (and more recent dates) has a
valuable claim on Cockney sentiment. She was the most
pathetic stage-picture of a London gutter-snipe that
London ever saw, or is likely to see, and although the
little woman is only a name to the younger generation,
she remains a vivid reality to the generation which can
better afford ten shillings for a seat. Poor Jennie tells
the t’other-side theatrical world that all her “savings”
were “swept away during the Australian bank panic.”
The fact that she had said goodbye to affluence along
while before the boom burst is hardly worth mentioning,
except as a further reason for the proposed benefit.
Money slipped through Jennie’s fingers like greased
lightning in her prosperous years, but a long acquain-
tance with hard-uppish ness has probably taught her to
appreciate all she can get nowati nes.
Sydney D.T’s London correspondent re the Lydia
Thompson benefit “It is rather unfortunate that the
benefit for poor Jennie Lee should have to follow so
closely on the Lydia Thompson affair, seats for which are
fetching fabulous prices. One fancied the Queen of
Blonde Burlesquers (as she was called in the early
seventies) had long been forgotten, but the fact that an
aged nobleman, with one leg in the grave, gave £2oofor
a box last Monday shows the fair lady’s name can still
provoke blithesome memories.”
Lydia Thompson married Alec. Henderson, whom
old Melbourne playgoers knew in the early sixties at
the old Princess’s. When Alec, went to England he
had a, run of good luck, and 13 years ago his friend, J. B.
Greville, used to tell people, with his big rolling eyes
wide open, that Alec, was “ riding in his carriage, my
boy ! ” Of late years Alec, and Lydia didn’t climb the
same apple-tree.
Melbourne’s latest “infant prodigy” is Miss Una
Bourne, a pretty girl in a quite-short dress, and hair
hanging loose, who played the pianoforte solos at Amy
Castles’ concert. The.daily journals unanimously ac-
cepted little Miss Una as a child “about half-way through
her teens.” She is so very clever and promising that there
can be no need to disguise in a short frock the fact that
Miss Bourne is “getting on for 18.” The Law has fixed
a time when girls ought to cease to appear as children,
except in theatrical characters.
Dearß.—lVhydidn’t somebody gently lead off theShake-
speare-Rignold stage those two refined ladies miscalled
Ford and Page, and introduce instead the buxom, red-
cheeked dames who really did play that risky little game
on Falstaff ? A contemporary praises the “ Merry Wives ”
for its giimpse into middle-class home-life of some cen-
turies back ; but in some respects the mediaeval atmo-
sphere doesn’t manage to cross the footlights. These
were the days when real ladies breakfasted off ale and
junks of meat, and smacked their maids in public, and
were themselves soundly spanked by their husbands
when occasion seemed to demand it. Now', did Miss
Wheeler and Miss Watts-Phillips look as if they had ever
been spanked V—Constance Clyde.
A worthy priest gave Amy Castles a gold-piece to go
the rounds of the fortune-tellers at St. Vincent’s fair.
The first, Prof. Somebody, had not the good luck to
recognise Amy ; he saw a plainly-dressed girl, and gave
her a journey across the water, and a dark man whose
initial-letter was W. Also, he warned her against the
month of May. Then one of Amy’s companions inquired
guilelessly, “ Has she any particular talents ?” The prof,
gazed at the palm critically, then shook his head. “The
young lady might paint a little—but she is domestically
inclined; she should make an excellent cook.’’ “Ami
musical?” inquired Amy. “More persevering than
musical—l daresay 3'ou might play or sing a little, with
diligence.” She thanked and paid him, and then told
him her name.
Adelaide has had its first look at “The Three Mus-
keteers.” As an educational influence the show should
be valuable, for when it was produced in London the Ad-
vertiser talked of “ Athos and Pathos,” while the Reois-
tbr quietly set down Dumas’ immortal work as “The
Three Miss Ketens " !
The Williamson divorce-case came to hearing a day or
two ago, and John Stofel and daughter Lizzie w'ere put
asunder by a decree nisi. The case wasn’t much like any
other case. Neither party was there in person. The
affidavit submitted on behalf of Maggie Moore w'as im-
perfect. On the other side there was no affidavit at all,
no appearance, no objection, no nothing. One person
swore to the marriage, and another person who said she
had been cook to somebody swore to something else.
And that was all; hut the case W'as legally complete and
that was the end of it.
The divorce of Justin Huntly M'Oarthy, M.P., from
Cissie Loftus (daughter of Ben Brown, formerly burnt-
cork artist in Melbourne, and music-hall singer Mary
Loftus) is a queer affair. Not only does the young woman
sav that “ she was still friendly with her husband," but
only a few weeks back M'Carthy published a new edition
of his prose translation of Omar Khayyam dedicated “To
Cecilia.” In this dedication, which is in sonnet form,
J.H.M‘O. informs Cissie that the nightingale with “pas-
sionate madness” sings “Farewell, farewell to every-
thing,” and that he will sing the same song “in dreams
beside some stream where tulips sail,” while Cissie re-
clines on Caesar’s dust, and strings her lute “ through all
the languid afternoon, to Persian airs of desert and of
palm.” Perhaps that is what upset Cissie. To string a
lute all the afternoon while hubby dreamed (and, per-
haps, snored in his sleep) would be apt to be boresome.
Late Yankee advices tell that Mrs. Brown-Potter’s hus-

going to fight any attack upon her honor to the bitter
end.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
As one of liis wildest and most incomprehensible
reasons against Federation the splashy G. R. Dibbs says
(S.M. Herald report) that “ In the bank panic of 1893 all
the N.S.W. gold went to Victoria to keep some of its
banks open ; that would show how dependent Victoria
was on N.S.W.” Apart from the fact that there was more
gold then in Victoria than in N.S.W., and that only one
Victorian bank—the Royal—kept open, this involves a
very serious charge against Dibbs’s brother of the Com-
mercial Bank, and the manager of the Bank of N.S.W.,
and other respectable citizens of great tonnage. For
these people presented their usual quarterly returns that
year, in which they professed to have so many millions of
gold in N.S.W., and if it had all gone to Melbourne they
couldn’t well have had it. Therefore it seems, according
to G. Dibbs’s statement, that T. Dibbs’s sworn returns
were false, which is a serious charge to bring
against a gentleman of T. Dibbs’s very high and
hitherto-unohallenged character. Also, Coghlan’s statistics
of exports allege that all the gold sent from N.S.W. to
Victoria in the bank panic year of 1893 was £lOO,OOO
worth, and that Victoria sent £352,400 worth to N.S.W.,
so it would look as if the dependence was the other way
about. Just here G. Dibbs incidentally sets down Coghlan
as a man who supplies false statistics, and if Coghlan
doesn’t kick hard at this aspersion he must be a very
peaceful statistician. Poor Dibbs and about a dozen other
silly old men of the same calibre have done a lot to bring
N.S.W. into undeserved contempt. The people of the
other provinces begin to have an idea that all the Corn-
stalks are mean grudging braggarts of the one pattern—
which they aren’t.

By another wild wriggle, Sydney Telegraph is
now demanding an arrangement by which the Federal
Govt, will undertake to return to each province—not sim-
ply three fourths of its customs revenue, whatever that
may be—but a sum equal to the whole of its customs
revenue as it stood the year before Federation. “If Mr.
Reid had accepted this,” says the paper which will lose
£5OOO a year if the present Bill goes through, “ he would
have undoubtedly carried the Bill in N.S.W.” Let’s see !
The customs revenue of the six provinces last year was
over £6,loo,ooo—about 345. per head per annum all
round. So, with a uniform tariff, all the provinces would
have had to be taxed, in customs alone, at the average
rate of 345. per head, and the whole amount returned to
the provinces. To pu t the Federal Govt, in as good a
position as it is now (i.e., to let it retain one-fourth of the
customs revenue), the average customs taxation must be
£2 ss. 4d. per head. That would be an increase of 265. 4d.
per head annually in customs taxation alone in N.S.W. —
and the Telegraph is making the air blue and green with
curses because it says the present system will mean an
extra tax of only 225. 6d. in customs and excise both put
together. And the much-wobbled Telegraph says it
wants the people of N.S.W. to reject the alleged 225. 6d.
system and wait till they can get one which will cost
265. 4d. instead !

The Premier Permanent Building Society (Mel-
bourne), run by Jimmy Mirams and his umbrella, has got
to the end of its ninth year of liquidation, and the report
just issued appears to indicate that the worst of the
struggle is over. When the liquidator took hold he found
himself in possession of over £1,000,000 worth of pro-
perty, all mortgaged up to the neck, including long rows
of unfinished houses and wildernesses of empty jerry
tenements. It was necessary to raise £620,000 to pay off
mortgages before there was any chance of a look-in for
the depositors. All these secured claims have been paid
off, barring a fragment of about £20,000. There are now
£516,000 worth of depositors to reckon with, and the
assets are worth on paper about £lv5,()00, so the liquida-
tor estimates the dividend will be fcbout 4s. in the £.
The first 6d. should be due just about ten years from the
date of the original smash. Ten years !!

Dear Bulletin. — I used to post The Buijetin
to a friend in Maoriland (1500 miles away), postage Jd.
Same friend has now shifted to Paddington, Sydney (one
mile away). I still post The Bulletin to her, postage Id.
Why are these things thus ?—J.
The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Co.
(Maoriland), which has a huge and bitter grievance
against the M.L. Government for competing against its
British private enterprise, made a net profit of i 3200 for
the year ended 28th February, 1899, equal to £1 17s. Bd.
per cent, per annum on its paid-up capital of £170,000.
And as it pays a dividend of 5 per cent. (£8500), it
naturally goes back considerably. All the same, the
Wellington and Manawatu Co. hasn’t anything like so
large a grievance as appears. It got a concession and a
big land grant from the Government in ’B3, and proceeded
to build a railway which absorbed £850,000. The share-
holders, like the Midland crowd which came after them,
refused to put their own precious money into their
own enterprise—at least, they put £170,000, and
borrowed the other £680,000. The co. had to pay
5 per cent, on the borrowed money (£34,000 a year).
If it had built the whole line with its_ own cash
it would have £37,200 profit with which to pay a dividend
on £850,000 of capital—equal to nearly 4| per cent., which
is a lot more than the State railways earn. The Welling-
ton-Manawatu monopoly has always charged huge rates
in order to earn the 5 per cent, which it has to pay
through its own bad financing, and it piled on the rates so
gaily that it has paid the 5 per cent, interest to its deben-
ture-holders, and declared a long series of 5 per cent, and
6 per cent, dividends, and has accumulated over £50,000 —
equal to another div. of nearly 30 per cent. And Maori-
land is growing a trifle weary of its Manawatu railway
monopoly.

The big Victorian carrying firm of Permewan,
Wright and Co. ended its 15th year on 31st Jan. with a
net profit of £3769. This is reasonably good, being equal
to £lO Is. per cent, per annum on the paid-up capital of
£37,500 ; still it compares rather badly with the big re-
turns of only a few years ago. Some recent net profits
were as follows :
1892 .. £6935
1893 .. 7230
1894 .. 5395
1895 .. 4549
1896 .. £2051
1897 .. 4844
1898 .. 4513
1899 .. 3769
The usual 10 per cent, dividend takes £3750 out of this,
leaving only £l9 to strengthen the co.’s position. The
same 10 per cent, dividend has been paid regularly for
many years. During the past eight years P.W. and Co.
have saved £9287, whereby their reserves have been
raised to £21,167 (reserve-fund, £20,000, and profit-
balance, £1167). One visible result of the 10 per cent,
policy is that the business has grown too large for the
co’s funds; it is now working on £58,667 of the share-
holders’ capital and reserves, and about £45,000 of
other moneys—a good deal of it bank overdraft.
Therefore, it has been decided to make a call of ss. per
share (£9375), a course which might have been unneces-
sary if a humble 8 per cent, dividend had been paid in the
past, and thereafter to raise another £15,625 by issuing
12,500 more shares at par (255.) to the present proprietors.
This will make the capital £62,500. One problem just
here is whv the £1 shares of this steady 10 per cent.-
paying institution should be quoted on the Melbourne
market at so low a figure as “ buyers, 18s. 6d.”

Even the Westralian Thirst isn’t quite what it
was, in these bad times. The profits of the Swan Brewery,
Perth for the six months ended 31st March, 1899 the
thirsty half of the vear-were £17,709. This is equal to
rather^more than 46 per oerit. per annum on the paid-up
capital, which looks srlorious enough, yet for the corres-
Donding half of 1893 the Swan Co. realised £24,048-
equal to 108 per cent per annum on the then capital. The
dividend is at the rate of 12 per cent, per annum (£450.)),
which is a very handsome figure, though compared with
the gorgeous 34 and a fraction per cent, of last year it
looks comparatively mean. Also the co. s oveidiaft is
£8741 against £3178 a year ago, and the report speaks
anxiously about heavy losses which have been vritten off
the reserve for depreciation, so the actual promts the
half-year are evidently much less than the S\ t, 709 above
stated. Another *lO,OOO has been set aside to meet
future losses. The Swan Co. is the lessee of many hotels,
and an all-round reduction in the great W.A. dnnkitite is
liable to produce serious results. *
The Riverina Frozen Meat Co. (Melbourne)
tells a short and dismal tale of the drought in southern
N.S.VV. in these figures :

1898 Profit .. £1897

The great shipping and all-sorts firm of Burns,
Philp and Co., the joint-stock deities of North Queens-
land, where the sun only rises by arrangement with Burns
and sets by Philp’s permission, looks up again after a
temporary depression. The year’s profits to 31st. March
were £42,412, the best record the co. has put up for a
long time, and equal to 15J per cent, per annum on
the paid-up capital of £267,500. An 8 per cent, dividend
absorbs £21,400 ; an addition of £20,000 is made to the
reserve, raising it to £120,000, and the balance is carried
to depreciation account. Burns, Philp and Co. began its
career as a joint stock enterprise in 1883. It paid 10 per
cent, up to 1885 ; 8 per cent, in 1886 ; 12 per cent, in its
great boom year of 1887 ; then 10 per cent, for six years
to ’93 ; 7£ per cent, to '95, and 8 per cent since then. So
it isn’t for nothing that the firm is the vast brass god of
all the North from Brisbane to Papua, and for 2000 miles
of torrid coast it daren’t rain unless Burns Philp, and Co.
are agreeable.

B.H. Block 14 has made a profit of ,£16,221 in
the six months ; but from this between £4OOO and £5OOO
is a fair deduction for depreciation. This mine’s sulphides
are poor ; it required 48,000 tons of its own ore and 17,000
tons of purchased stuff to give even this much profit—
equal to about 4s. 9d. per ton ; or, allowing for deprecia-
tion, about 3s. 6d. This is not much of a margin, but,
then, there is the zinc in the tailings to be considered. As
to this, the directors say: “Our zinc products, which
have been carefully stacked near the mill ever since we
commenced treating sulphide ore, seem likely to prove an
asset of some value in the near future, as methods for
dealing with such material are distinctly coming into
view. We have on hand at the present time something
like 200,000 tons of this product.” Corning from Block 14
people, this means more than it would if most others were
responsible for it. A bit more profit certainly wouldn’t
hurt the shareholders, who have not had more than
£lO,OOO for many a half-year past, and often nothing at
all. And seeing that they have made a plucky fight of
it, and that the mine is paying just over £lOO,OOO a year
in wages and £60,000 a year for flux and fuel, not to speak
of the bills for timber and rail-carriage and other things :
and, lastly, that the mine is one of the safest to work in
on the Barrier, this paper feels that it can wish share-
holders 100 per cent, more luck (via zinc treatment or
otherwise) without being guilty of extravagant generosity.

B.H. Junction issues a very gloomy half-yearly
report. Most things seem to have gone wrong. The co.
in the good old days let its development work get so far
behind that now the mill can’t be kept going. Also the
product has not come up to expectations ; and just when
a nice extra profit might be made through the rise in
prices, the co. has been held to an ancient contract and
has had to supply both crude and concentrated ore,
which, so far as the latter is concerned, can only be done
at a loss. The contract, it seems, was for high-grade ore ;
and as there is not any of this material available, an
action at law (with that whale for law, too—the Austra-
lian Smelting Co.) has only been averted by agreeing to
substitute concentrates. The “ profit ” for the six months
has reached, according to the directors’ statement,
£5239 ; but just about the whole of this is swallowed
up in development and depreciation—both of them
charges which must be made in the half-year’s accounts.
The co. still has £lO,OOO of borrowed money to pay off,
but, apart from this, it has liquid assets worth about
£6OOO more than its liabilities. Meantime, while the co.
is slowly making up the ground it lost through the col-
lapse of its mine-workings two years ago, the Camden (J.
Bull) syndicate continues to gather in the shares, until at
the close of the half-year 54,141 of the 100,000 in the co.
were on the London register. Melbourne, which once
held almost the whole lot, accounts now for only 12,244.
* » * *
What sort of work the Junction concentrating
mill is doing the shareholders can only make a blind guess
at. The report lately issued gives the assay value of the
concentrates as averaging about 240 z. of silver, 61 per
cent, lead, and just over 8 per cent, zinc ; also, it is set
out that it required 48,109 tons of crude ore to make 8718
tons concentrates. But as the value of the ore itself is
not reported, it cannot possibly be told whether the work
done is good, bad, or wretched ; though, looking at the
financial results, it seems to be pretty bad. It would be
interesting to know whether the English syndicators have
any more information to work on than this. .At a low
computation, and not taking into account the zinc at all,
there is £3 10s. worth of metal in a ton of Junction ore ;
and as mining and milling costs amount to only 14s. llfd.
per ton, there is a big margin—which shareholders eer-
tainlv are not getting. The most likely explanation is
that a. poor recovery is being made—in other words, most
of the metal is going into the dump. And it is just pos-
sible that the English people have their eye on that
rapidly-increasing dump, of what is now a waste material,
as they gather in the shares.

B.H. Block 10 is in splendid fettle. A new
discovery at 820 ft. (the deepest workings hitherto have
been at 715 ft.) is of great importance. What appears to
be an entirely new branch of the lode has been struck, at
least 6ft. wide, of solid sulphides, giving 26£oz. silver, 16
per cent, lead, and 27 per cent. zinc. A bet!er idea of the
value of this body is got by comparing it with the average
stuff put through from the higher levels last half-year—
-16*40z. silver, 17J per cent, lead, and 23 per cent. zinc.
And elsewhere the workings show generally good faces.

Lake George Mines, N.S.W. : Shares more
than doubled in a week. In less than three they jumped
from 10s. to 245. The public are told that the treatment
of the gossans bv cyanide has turned out all right; ex-
traction between 80 and 90 per cent., and the consump-
tion of cyanide is under ljlb. per ton of ore. Nothing
yet told 'as to value—quite a secondary consideration,
perhaps. Then it is stated that, there is a surplus of
£23,000 “ accounting for matte afloat ” ; that the financial
year closes 31st fast. ; that the co.’s meeting will be held
some time in Sept., when shareholders may expect the
directors to say something- re divs. All very well, hut
not quite enough to more than double the value of the
mine. Well known by ft few —and it ought to be
known by all—that the gossans are limited ; also
that they are very low-grade. Better to have had 1
per cent, improvement in copper contents than all this
yabber. It was when Lake George holders were led by
somebody, or something, to imagine it was a per eenu
copper-mine instead of a per cent., that the sharui
went to 70s. The few in the know got well out at about
that price. When the awful truth was exposed per blast-
furnace, which cannot yet be built to lie, shares slumped
to Is. 6d., and it was then that the same knowing ones
got in again. It is a low-grade property, well mined and
cheaply smelted, with next to nothing in it if copper went
back to what it was a few months ago. But the working
of the mine is nothing compared with the working of the
market, as sending the shares from Is. 6d. to 245. without
any improvement in the backbone of the mine is suffi-
cient evidence. The latest yarn is that Fiance has oome
into the market. Lake George is a mystery, and best left
alone by outsiders.

Oobar still gasps for water. Messrs. Hunt and

tion a few weeks hence.

South Glenfine, Vic. : A few months back these
shares were under 2s. Last week they reached £6, and,
at time of writing, had gone back to 90s. Alluvial mine,
in which a quartz lode was found. First crushing over
2oz. ; 100 tons divided between two Ballarat batteries,
and returns almost equal. Reef 6to 10 ft. thick, but not
yet opened sufficiently to say that mine is proved a big
div.-payer from quartz. Many lodes have been found in
Vic. alluvial mines, but few have paid. Amidst the S.
Glenfine boomsters the modesty of the boss is charming :
—“ Width of lode in face 7|ft., payable ; South drive in
solid stone—prospects payable. 320 tons at grass.” His
modesty evidently got the better of the boomsters’ judg-
ment. They hadn’t the faintest idea that the crushing
would average above an ounce. Up to clean-up shares
stood at 4Ss. —more than doubled within a few hours
after.

SOUTH GLENFINE MINE.
(To the Editor of the Age.)
Sir,— Concerning the South Glenfine mine, of which I
am an original shareholder, I, with others, would like to
know :
Ist. What number of forfeited shares were in the hands
of the co. when the quartz lode was struck ?
2nd. How were these shares disposed of, or are they
still in the hands of the co. ?
3rd. Have the directors taken any action to call an ex-
traordinary meeting of the shareholders to deal with the
same ?
Rumors are rife, and an official statement will give
satisfaction to others as well as to—Yours, &e.,
19th May. ORIGINAL SHAREHOLDER.
(2) Monday, May 22 :
The South Glenfine management are desirous of empha-
sising the fact that at no time since the inception of the
co. have any shares been forfeited.

Vie. Mines Minister Foster said at Castlemaine
lately that one quartz reef from which refractory ore
was mined, and which it was necessary to treat with sul-
phur, because of arsenical pyrites and other properties in
the stone, did more harm to water-courses than would be
done by all the dredging in the province. “ With sul-
phur ’’ probably meant cyanide or sulphuric acid. But in
nearly all cases quartz-mines retain their water for re-use,
while, with dredging, it is impossible in most cases, and
impracticable everywhere. River-dredging by buckets,
and alluvial-flat dredging by centrifugal pumps, can be
carried on in some places without much damage—it is
even possible in a few cases to do good, protecting river-
banks by forking the stones of wash against them—
but in many other places not only will the water be
polluted, but irreparable damage will be done to
land. Hydraulic mining was for years one of the
great industries of California. In single instances, mil-
lions of dollars were spent in bringing water on to claims
by gravitation. It was stopped by law. One block of
gold weighing a ton from these great sluicing claims was
sent with a petition to Congress protesting against the
stoppage—but without avail. Hydraulic mining is
allowed there, but it is so surivu- <■ 1 with restrictions as
to the deposit of the tailings that the profits are
absorbed. Is it likely that such extreme steps would have
been taken if great and lasting damage to lands hundreds
of miles away was not proved ? It is for the Lands and
Mines Depts. to find out where dredging can be carried
on without injury. It all hangs on one thing—deposit
of tailings ; for, compared with this, discoloration or pol-
lution of water is a small circumstance.

A Sydney syndicate has taken up a 50a. lease

Cyanide no longer booms on the Towers. The
Enterprise, Defiance, and Excelsior stacks will not be
worked out for some time, but all other tailings deposits
are finished up. Towers people have turned their atten-
tion to dredging. The Burdekin and the Cape are to be
worked, and many dredging areas have already been
secured. One syndicate intends going nortli to the old
Palmer River. There should be a lot of gold in the Cape,
as former attempts promised well despite the primitive
and ineffective plants employed.
f * * *
Chief hope of the Towers just now is the Pfeiffer
shaft, west of Upper Mosman-street. This is being sunk
to pick up the deep gold on the western end of the old
Day Dawn shoot. Will probably be the deepest shaft on
the field when bottomed ; expected to cost £BO,OOO, and
be two years in reaching the reef.
* * * *
That steady Towers div.-payer, the Brilliant,
is practically done ; its only chance is a new reef at greater
depth. The main shaft is already being sunk in the en-
deavor to find a new Brilliant. Towers investors recall
Dick Craven’s long struggle, and cheerfully face the
big work in front of them. Discovery would mean a
tremendous jump in all claims on the line.

The greatest copper find of the year seems to be
that made by Gibson, some 40 miles south from Clon-
curry, Q., and, like the few other big mining things, it
has already been secured by the Broken-Lyell-Chillagoe
brotherhood—Orr, Knox, Sehlapp, Kelly, and one or two
others, no doubt. It is known as the Hampden estate.
Gibson sent one or two lots of ore away, carting it some
200 miles to Hughenden, the nearest railway, and brought
the disoovery under the notice of the big crowd, who, as
customary, asked him to do some more work on it. This
was done ; two of the syndicate’s mining men, who hap-
pened to be up that way, were sent to see it, and
reported that it had ail the ear-marks of a big thing. W.
Orr followed, and the thing was taken over underworking
bond ; some £2OOO spent in costeening the lode for nearly
half-a-mile and sinking shallow shafts. They are more
than satisfied, and the manager, Hill, has just reported
that it is the biggest surface-show he has seen, and
describes it as a “Broken Hill in copper.” Some streaks
in the lode are phenomenally rich, giving as high as 60
per cent, copper, and the balance is said to be payable for
a great width. Lode in slate and schist, with limestone
in vicinity. A blast-furnace has been ordered from Fraser
and Chalmers, to be shipped at once. The railway to
Winton will bring the field within 100 miles, and the
owners will soon be ready with a proposal to bring the line
right into the camp. They have secured about two miles
on the lode themselves ; others have pegged for two miles
beyond them.

In another part of this issue appears the
abridged prospectus of the Mount Morgan Consolidated
Gold Mines, a Melbourne co. which is going to mine at
Mount Morgan, Queensland. There was a time when the
name of the great Mount was something to conjure with,
and there was a dizzy rush to take up the surrounding
country, and find more Mount Morgan mines, and every-
body thereabouts was a Vanderbilt or Astor or Rothschild
in anticipation. But it seemed that the big mine was a
curiosity that flocked all by itself—at least none of these
adjacent shows came to anything in particular. Possibly
it was because they didn’t sink far enough into the
bowels of the earth, and if the M.M. Consolidated Gold
Mines sinks further than any of them it may strike some-
thing immensely rich, or it may not strike 2d. At all
events, it begins in rather a small fashion. Out of the
60,000 shares, it seems that 2500 are actually taken up.
Then 51,500 are held by “Alex. James Peacock, legal
manager, in trust for shareholders,” and 6000 more are
held by the same person “in trust for company.” Only
two persons on the spot seem to have manifested their
faith in the M.M. Consolidated—by taking 100 shares
each, no liability.

The Ingersoll Rock Drill Co. has recently put
an improved drill upon the market. This is known
as the “ New Ingersoll,” and embodies many improve-
ments on the old type, good as that has undoubtedly
proved itself to be. The new drill is lighter, and at the
same time more powerful, while the number of wearing
parts has been greatly reduced. In a recent trial at
Charters Towers this machine came out on top of all
competitors. The Towers is a stronghold of the “ Inger-
soll,” which has been used there for years and is the
favorite with the men.

Moonta (S.A.) Copper Go’s directors recently
announced that they didn’t propose to increase the divs.,
despite the jump in the price of the metal. Only one
shareholder kicked ; but the reports of what foreign co.’s
are doing have since made others join in. Tharsis, they
find, is paying 271 per cent, now as against 25 per cent, in
’97, 15 per cent, in ’95 and ’96, and 10 per cent, in ’94.

One of the latest mining proposals is the treat-
ment of the auriferous cement on Neale’s River, in the
very heart of Australia. A Melb. syndicate has the
matter in hand.

The South Tharsis Copper Co., Mt. Lyell,
have lately entered into a contract with the Austral Otis
Engineering Co., South Melbourne, to supply a complete
crushing and concentrating plant for treatment of their
ores, whioh are mostly low grade. The plant is to be a
very complete one and comprises compound steam-engine
and boiler of 100 horse-power, 3 rock-breakers, 2 sets Roger
rolls, 8 4-compartment eccentric jiggs, 4 improved buddies
and Otis circular vanner, with the necessary trommels,
&c., for sizing and classifying the ore. The plant
has a capacity of 100 tons per day, with provision
for 200 tons. The Otis Co. are also supplying a self-acting
tramway from the mine to the mill; also, a pumping plant
to supply the mill with water from the dam.
Quite a boom in small-priced stocks at Adelaide.
Shares that have dropped out of sight for a year are again
quoted, and everyone is rushing in to pay back calls. Our
old friend Brown Hill Junction once more appears in the
list : buyer, Bd. ; seller, lOd. The Bulletin is anxiously
watching to see the Doras resurrect.
v * * * *
Peak Hill is the mysteriously worked and boomed
mine of Westralia. Shares, 350,000 of £1; price in Lon-
don, where they mostly are, £7 ; market value of mine,
therefore, nearly 2£ millions ; intrinsic value—well, there
are experienced people who have just seen the mine, and
say the shares would not be a safe deal at £l. Anyhow,
most of the price seems to be the outcome of some pool-
ing arrangement. Result of lasfJ»;lean-up from at least
10 weeks’ crushing not known in Ounp ; co. seems to have
refused a police escort, acceptance of which would have
obliged it to declare quantity. When Gov. Smith, accom-
panied by Schlapp, was there lately, the pinnacle of bom-
bastic advt. was reached by casting gold plates and a cup
for him to use at dinner; also, they made a superfine
prospecting pick, and then took him to a place which
had been readied-up so that he could pick out a
lump of ore hanging together with gold, about a yard
long. Others have played this game so often with other
Governors —with Loftus and Carington, at Lucknow mines
to wit—that it is quite stale, and for the Peak crowd of
boomsters to try it on now demonstrates that they are
amateurs in the bonanza business. Let it be hoped, in
the interests of Gov. Smith’s ultimate reputation, that
the cool and calculating Schlapp has whispered some
homely truths into his ear. The Warden was not invited
to the formal opening of battery—in fact, his presence
was entirely ignored, for reasons best known to the boom-
sters, and shrewdly guessed-at by others. But for sin. rain
water would have run short ; not much now to keep
20 heads going. Only 300 tons at grass and 120 men
working in mine. With abundance of litigation ; probable
shortage of water as well as ore ; a treacherous forma-
tion ; insignificant divs. and enormous exes., shares must,
unless something wonderful happens, soon fall despite the
pool and vice-regal advertising.

Mephati Ferguson, engineer, boiler-maker, etc.,
of Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, has just secured a
contract for the manufacture and supply of all the bolts,
nuts and washers which may be required by the Victorian
railways during the next three years. He has also con-
tracted to supply all the carbonic acid gas necessary for
working the railway refrigerating and ice-making plant—
this is one qf I. and E. Hall’s patent carbonic anhydride-
machines, tne same system as has been adopted by the
Govts, of South Australia, Queensland, and Western Aus-
tralia. Mr. Ferguson has a large stock of these machines
(suitable for meat-preserving co.’s, dairies, butchers, and
others) on hand at present, which he is selling at greatly-
reduced prices.*

The dynamite monopoly on the Rand is one of
three big grievances of the Uitlander. At recent meet-
ings in Sydney and Melbourne to protest, there was not
the slightest allusion made to the existence of anything
of the kind throughout Australasia. Not so bad as in the
Transvaal, but bad enough—and, in the interests of
mining, which is being economised in all other directions,
it is time something was said and done about it. Cost of
manufacture, as a rule less than one-third the retail cost,
and making every allowance for freight and landing
restrictions, 150 per cent, advance is a lot too mueh.
Practically no competition—except from other explosives,
dynamite being controlled' by a ring. The Hercules
Giant Dynamite Co., of America, came into the field two
years ago, and retired last year under conditions. That
generally happens. It would be good business for the
State to'manufacture dynamite.

Aletes ” on “Birthstains,” now and here-
after :
What a tremendous row ! what indignation ! what
minor ! About what ? About a quotation from the
imperial poet made by His Ex. to the people of N.S.W.
irurntul . In a poetic way—yes. Complimentary? Cer-
tainly Appropriate? Why not? Most of our'visiting
cmics have made similar remarks about us, unalloyed
with such honeyed sweetness. Bulletin itself is for ever
taunting us with this, and that, lingering from the Dark
nays. His Ex. has my sympathy. But really, the matter
s not serious enough even for humor. The average Aus-
tralian doesn’t care a hang—no, I must not say Hang
about the whole affair. (In confirmation, witness the
cordial reception of the alleged offender.) He’s much too
tired to look hack and scan where he came from, and iust
n< ?'. v . . 8 ra tber worried about where he’s going to—
which its name is Federation. The day may c6me-when
this Present lies like a dim cloud on Time’s horizon—
when he will tumble over his fellows to annex that birth-
stain as a thing of glory and a joy for ever. (We im-
ported some of our best blood in those days.) The
original subjects of Gov. Phillip will then rank with the
Norman buccaneers of William. Probably it won’t,
though. For the time fast approaches when the indivi-
dual alone will count in the social scale. Meanwhile let
us keep our livers in order.

upon going to rule over a kind of thieves’ kitchen.

Ihe entrde cards at Gov. Beauchamp’s first
levee perpetuated the finical ecclesiastical
etiquette observed by his predecessors. Church
of England Bishops were invited as “ The
Bishops’ of Goulburn, Bathurst, Armidale, and
so on, but the Roman Catholic as “The R.C.
Bishops of,” &c. Where there are two Bishops in
any part of Australia, there is no proper official
warrant for addressing either as “ The Bishop ” of
the quarter. A cleric who would fight the point
might be termed testy, bat a testy man is sorne-
times needed to prick the bladder of pretentious
officialdom.

The officers of Sydney St. George’s Rifles
(Colonel Jawbone Neild) were, “through an un-
fortunate accident,” unable to get the busbies
which had been ordered to wear at the Queen’s
Birthday parade. When these absurdly ignorant
and pretentious players-at-soldiery turn out in
busbies, the Sydney dogs will indeed have
something to bark at. Busbies in semi-tropi-
cal Sydney! The vanity of some alleged
men far surpasses that of any woman.
A good instance is furnished by the evidence in a
recent Sydney police-court case against one
Byrne for non-delivery of his “National Guard ”
uniform, upon retirement from that doughty band
of warriors. The trouble, it was elicited, had all
sprung from the fact that Byrne had figured in a
Sydney illustrated as “commanding the first
Governors guard,” and his superiahs didn’t like
it. I here had been too much of this papah
business, don t you know ! ” Byrne, also, had
taken himself so seriously as to have written
shoals of letters about the matter to his former
lieutenant; who, to crown the absurdity, himself
promptly paid the fine inflicted on Byrne. There’s
a big lot of “pretty cookies ” among the local tin-
soldiery.

The self-stultifying attitude of doctrinal
religion was well exemplified by a recent clerical
denunciation at Albury, N.S.W., of the fortune-
telling and palmistry fraternity. When his
reverence charged the votaries of these vulgar and
impudent impostors with pitiable superstition
he was emphatically right; but, when he
further characterised such dealings as “ taking
counsel with the Enemy of God,” he was simply
meeting superstition with superstition. And
things which are equal to one another are equal
to the same thing.

At St. Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney, a few
Sundays back, an odious comparison, illustrating
one aspect of Australian physical decadence,
was free to all. A group of imported “ Soggarths ”

mens from good old Tipperary and there-
abouts—side by side with the Cardinal’s Aus-
tralian elect, the peaky, weedy, undersized,
pasty-faced, depressing-looking Manly College
Divinity students. The Bulletin sorely fears
that the Australee man will never make an
effective priest. The son of the Southern Cross
(taking the Manly divinity student as a sample)
may make a nice corpse, but he is altogether of
the wrong sort to offer effective consolation to the
sick, the widow and the fatherless ; on the con-
trary the very sight of him would be strongly
calculated to make a slowly-dying man peg-out

Gov Tennyson (S.A.) is suspected of
playing- for his average. He is always ready, on
occasions that call for eloquence, with a few well-
polished remarks in which the relatives hang
neatly on to the antecedents, and the time-gaining
er-er of his immediate predecessor finds no
place. But when he has nothing to say he says
nothing, entirely refusing to be “drawn” on those
occasions when the average man stands up un-
necessarily to say “ a few words,” and says them
very badly. A sensible way of keeping up one’s
reputation. °

crept into this movement. It is well known that the
chairman of the meeting is notan ardent lover of Rome
I earnestly hope that no one of the Catholic people of

at the adoration of Gov. Gormanston by theß.O.’s
because he attended mass regularly. Davitt’s
opinion of Gormanston : “A bad Irishman and a
worse landlord.” The Plan of Campaign hit his
lordship s Irish rent-roll severely in a tender spot,
so probably His Ex.’s opinion of Michael is unfit

Concerning Vic. County Court
If Judge Casey returns to the County Court Bench
when his sick-leave is up-he suffers from rheumatic gout
—there will one day be a scene on that side of the Law
Courts. One prominent practitioner openly states that
he cannot get justice from “ King ” Casey on account of
the latter s unreasonable prejudices. Just before the
Judge went on holidays, said practitioner returned all
his briefs in cases on Cifsey’s list; he even went so far as
to consult other lawyers as to whether he should or should
not bring the matter before open Court. Learning, how-
ever, that there was a doubt as to “ the King” again taking
up judicial duties, he refrained from doing so. Whatever
the merits of this dispute, one thing is certain : Vie.
t y leaso " of fche Physical weakness and
MiitaJdcfects of some of its Judges and acting-judges,
has hdlen into the uttermost contempt as a tribunal of
justice. To see a man four days trying a case which any
competent Judge should get through in one is more than
a joke. Arguments placed before that Judge in the
morning are forgotten in the afternoon and have to be
repeated. When counsel raises a point of law as to the
admission of a piece of evidence, the invariable reply is
Go on—there is no question before the Court” ; and
his Honor spends no end of time in shrieking at witnesses
and explaining that he can’t hear what they are saying—
as if the fault were theirs. J ”

Apropos the usefulness of benefit societies
A man recently died in Melb. who had been “ on ”
the sick.funds of his lodge for 20 years and had
drawn .£546 m sick pay.
The latest woman allegedly killed by an
abortion operation, performed with a septic in-
strument, said when dying, “ I hope Dr.
won’t be hanged.” That was graceful, anyhow.
But (without in any way prejudging this particu-
lar ease) it is disgraceful, at this time of day, that
any woman should ever be allowed to die from
such a wbolly-preventible cause.

The other day a man at Hobart got a letter
addressed to him at “Hobart, Tasmania, New
Zealand.” It came from the office of a big Lon-
don magazine, and he was asked to write a series
of articles on the manners and customs of the
Tas. natives. Seeing that Tasmania is 1000 miles
from Maoriland, and the last of the V.D.L.
aborigines died over 20 years ago, nobody can
wonder at De Rougemonts befooling George
Newnes and the ignorant Cockneys, who know
as much about the “ Wide World ” as Newnes
will ever know about the South Pole.

easily fool the inspectors as one drawing 30s. per week.
The reason is that if the Board were to pay full rates for
these children (and it should be noted that children
boarded out to strangers are allowed clothing, medicine,
&c., all free, while those left with their mothers are not),
the strain on the consolidated revenue would soon cause
the repealing of that clause of the Act which allows
children to be paid for while with their mothers. As it
is, there is a premium already on desertion, but, if the
mother of a family of six could claim 30s. from the State
in the event of her husband deserting her, how many
wharf-laborers earning from 255. a week would stay to
provide for their families? Even as matters stand, nearly
6000 children are directly dependent on the N.S.W. State.

According to Windsor Gazette, “ Patrick
Finnucane, proprietor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel
at Murwillumbah, Tweed River (N.S.W.), refused
to accommodate three kanakas with lodgings, and
was fined for that offence £5.” “ M’bah,” as the
Tweed people call it for short, could do with a
few more of the Einnucane stamp. Tommy Tanna
is getting a firm footing on the Tweed, and soon
mean whites will be lifting their hats to kanakas
with capital, as the Cairns alleged whites do to
the moneyed Chows. Truly the Northern rivers
are getting piebald. Wyrallah for Hindoos !
Murwillumbah for kanakas! Even the blacks
grow more bleached and toney every year.

The evidence mainly relied on by the
Crown against Anastasia Butler, accused of the
murder of her father, on Easter Sunday, at Mans-
field (Vic.), was that relating to her general ap-
pearance and demeanor between that date and the
finding of the body on 19th April. Several
female witnesses testified that Anastasia was
“low-spirited,” “depressed,” “sighedfrequently,”
“shook her head sadly,” was “pale and shaky,”
“white and agitated,” &c. ; and one up-to-date
spinster on Easter Sunday night, when in ac-
cused’s company, detected the aroma of a cigar
and, inferentially, a man. Judging from recent
events, Detective Dungey must be considered a
women’s specialist. He was, at all events, rushed
at Mansfield with feminine volunteers ready and
eager to emulate and out-rival Sherlock Holmes.
A common, unimaginative, Mansfield jury, how-
ever, by bringing in a verdict of insufficient evi-
dence to determine the cause of death, robbed the
subsequent proceedings of the interesting denoue-
ment expected. Many witnesses were much dis-
appointed at missing a franked trip to the fashion-
able assize-town of Beech worth, and one in
particular was heard to bewail his hard luck, as he
intended taking his people with him fora holiday.
During the Mansfield-mystery coroner’s inquiry,
the. son of deceased Butler told the jury he had
not discovered the loss of a carving-knife from his
late father’s residence for several days. It was
brought to his recollection by seeing a picture of
W. G. Grace, with a carving-knife in his hand,
before a joint of beef, with the title, “ Grace Be-
fore Meat —A Clean Cut.” Then he remembered
his father’s carving-knife, searched for and could
not find it, and finally told the police. The name
of the next witness examined at the same inquiry
was “Bat” something. The trail of cricket
over all.

“Y ”. “ Perce ” (8., 20/5/’99) scratches
the surface of an interesting question, but his con-
clusion is fallacious. Smooth-skinned men are
good men-of-the-world, and consequently are more
in a position to pamper women. Hairy men are
more careless, more generous, and more liable to
monetary failure. Among navvies, where both
types are seen close to nature, have noticed that
the “hairy hog” paid for his board and grog,
whereas the smooth-skin was addicted to “slop-
ing.” The hairy fellow has most vitality, the
other ditto most cunning.

S.A. Gas co.’s shareholders
are hysterical with delight over
the continued failures of the
electrio light at Port Adelaide,
the first suburb to adopt the new

suspicions that the gas people

pering with their cables.
At Port Melb. court, the

with the larceny of a gun from
his late employer—a lady. In
defenoe he pleaded that the lady
kept a cat-farm, and expected
him to pick fleas from the toms
and tabbies with a pair of
tweezers. Grown weary of
hunting small game, he went
forth with the gun to kill kan-
garoos. ,
Brown is mayor of a wes-

was the other candidate. Then
Brown to Jones —“Say, Jones,

away next week. Will you be

And so, on election-day, Brown,
who finds he can turn up after
all, drops his four votes in for
his pal, O’Hooligan, while Jones
finds that he is debarred from
giving his three votes for his own pal. Differ-
ence, seven votes —which, as it proved, won
O’Hooligan the seat. Smart ?

David Syme missed a splendid sensation
at his very door while the improvements to his
office were in progress. In taking a 20-foot girder,
weighing tons, down the stairs one day, the work-
men in charge were beaten by the weight of metal,
and it shot down those stairs like an arrow. Tear-
ing the edges off each of the front steps, the
girder landed end-on in the street, cutting open
the footpath and eventually bringing up against
a fire-plug. As a general thing the footpath is
crowded thereabouts, and in ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred two or three deaths would have hap-
pened. But no one was even hurt.

Westralian judges—there are three of
them—are understood to protest that it will be
impossible for them to carry on the work if the
request for Circuit Courts on the goldfields is
granted. As things stand now, cases listed for
last October have only just been reached. Out-
side Perth the Supreme Court judges now sit only
at Geraldton and Albany; they seem to dodge the
rough inlands just as their N.S.W. brothers dodge*
the long trip to Broken Hill. It is an age since a
regular Supreme Court man sat at the latter place.
Angry city alderman (who has just been
s nubbed by barmaid before a big crowd for his
loud-mouthed indecency):— “ Here, what’s this
dirt in my glass?” holding it up to the light.
Hebe (sweetly): “Oh, probably something that’s
fallen out of your mouth.” Tact.
Police officialdom keeps many records, but
one or two more would not be amiss.
For instance, should not a record be
kept of those marked coins the in-
telligent detective sets in motion to
trap a suspect? How many of such
coins get out of the’tee.’s control and
into general circulation? Some day,
one of them is found in the pocket of
a suspect, and another ’tec. identifies it
as one just let loose by himself—for, as a
rule, the same old familiar mark goes on
them all. Talk goes that there are hun-
dreds of these coins at large in Sydney.
Again, to test efficiency of gaol-warders
it is becoming the custom to plant
chisels, files, &c., in prisoners’ cells.
If the warder doesn’t discover them,
he is black-marked. But it is
solemnly asserted that prisoners who
knew nothing about the trap laid for
the warder have been brought up and
punished for having chisels, files, &c.,
concealed in their cells. In these cases
it would seem the officials forgot where
they laid their plant.
A serious hardship in the far-back
country is the excessive time which often
elapses between a police-court committal and
trial at quarter-sessions (which are out there
held only twice a year) or the circuit-court.
Thus at Wentworth, one day in April, a
man was committed for trial on Nov. 29
that is, five months after the preliminary
hearing. Worse still, Judge Gibson, who
sits at Wentworth, has again and again in-
timated that people who go bail for ac-
cused persons are fools of the deepest dye.
The result is that possibly (and presum-
ably) innocent persons who are accused
stand a big chance of six months’ gaol,
anyhow. Moreover, the J’sP., and even
the P.M’s, out there are, generally speak-
ing, very chary about dealing “on their
own ” with any charge above drunk and
disorderly; so the infrequency of this
higher court-sittings is a far bigger hardship
than it would be in a city.
Extract from the “Our Doctor” column
of Melb. Herald
Mother writes :—“ About 12 months ago, my daughter,
in getting on her bicycle, slipped, and caught the end of
her backbone on the saddle. Since then, whenever she
leans back in a chair, it aches very much.”—Give her
tonic medicines, and place a small fly-blister over the
painful spot, and let her rest in bed for a few days.
Did the young lady’s backbone project—had she a
tail, or what? Anyhow, the thought of a fly-
blister on the “ painful spot ” should surely deter
women from biking.

In a Melb. County Court case, t’other
day, the fair complainant merely asked for a
guarantee that the ruffled female next door would
not utter any more libellous statements about her.
“You can get no guarantee from an angry
woman,” said Judge Gaunt.
Concerning a Victorian police grievance :
The shooting of a Oollingwood constable by some un-
known—who drew him within range by shamming sick—
recalls the absurd rule followed by Vic. Police Dept, re
the regulation revolver. Constable Nichol, with a bullet
in his left shoulder, drew his own “squirt,” a short,
thick “ bulldog,” and fired at the retreating assassin, but
without effect. The bulldog is a poor arm at a distance, but
had the officer had a regulation long-barrel “ barker,” he
would have had some chance of bagging- the fugitive.
According to Vic. police practice, constables are per-
mitted the use of revolvers only when on night duty,
which occurs every three weeks. When going on at
night, forms have to be filled in, signed, copied, and duly
presented, whereupon a revolver is handed over and a
receipt accepted. At the expiration of the night duty
the pistol has to be returned with further ceremony and
formality—the result being that, rather than go through
all this flummery, the usual copper prefers to buy a
weapon of his own ; and generally he buys a cheap one.

The struggle to “ Americanise our institu-

Matrimonial advfc. cut from an Irish weekly
of recent date :
A quiet, retiring person of steady manners, having
only two children, with ample belongings, consisting of
extensive lands, good business houses, and a fine showy,
commodious residential villa nicely situated and taste-
fully embellished with the most expensive modern im-
provements, hereby announces his anxiety to forward a
matrimonial alliance, and desires to communicate with a
good, proper, serious female whose close acquaintance
would prove her willingness to satisfy him in domes-
tic relations, provided she possesses a joyous musical
temper. Lack of money nor mature age will be no
hindrance to our union; in fact, a strongly-built vir-
gin of forty-five years will be preferred, to one of more
tender age, a widow weaned from the follies of youth with
family small enough to suit would also be eligible. To
prove that age has not impaired bodily vigor, I am pre-
pared to appear before a medical tribunal ; and as to my
other capabilities, the surrounding gentry can speak from
experience, and, as proof of my social rank, I will be
guided into matrimony by the individual opinion of a
country gentleman living a short distance north of my
ancestral mansion.—MICHAEL HALLINAN, Rathsalla,

Contraband trafficking still rages at Pen-
tridge prison, but nowadays no official is ever
absolutely detected in the act of introducing any
of the tobacco, sugar, whisky and other necessaries
of life which illicitly find their way into the place,
although extensive “ plants ” are now and then
discovered about the quarries and other works.
After all, the warder who has to keep a family
outside on .£9 a month is only human, and it often
pays him to be deaf and blind.
QUATRAINS.
When a fair Thought conies new-waked to my head
I’m all a-flutter till it’s dressed and fed ;
Then father-fond T play with it all day,
And when with frolic tired put it to bed.
I only ask of Fate a beggar’s boon—
To let my heart beat steady to the tune
That it was beating to when I was young;
And when it falters, then let Death come soon.
This fairy money—his love-letters—l
Count and re-count it in my treasury ;
Each has the true ring of the golden coin,
And in my heart again I put them by.
We must go down unto the Grave before
We can know what the Dead are doing, or
What drink they have when thirsty who have done
With Wine and Water here for evermore.

Thus “A.R.T.”: A Bulletin (13/5/’99)
scribe writes, “ Wearers of P.D. corsets never grow
old.” There is truth in this. Youth is entirely a
matter of curves : Wearers of P.D.’s, by keeping
their figure curves youthful, do much to preserve
the girlishness of their facial beauty ; for the com-
forting thought that the figure is perfect begets a
happy youthfulness of expression. The truism
above is therefore worth remembering by the cor-
set-wearing sex.*

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Mr Dear Myke- May 30 ' ISM '
Saturday morning, if you please. The Gov-
ernor s writing room. He sits at his desk. One
nervous, narrow hand is for ever altering the
position of a pen, shifting a sheet of paper, draw-
ing lines on his blotting-pad, moving something
continually, at the beck of a highly-strung tem-
perament. From this point of view, there is more
or the student, more of the delicato, serious young
Oxonian, than of the vice-regal presence. And
through the glass door of a book-case in the back-
ground, Ruslan, the dead Morris, and others who
can do it worthily, sustain the impression. The
voice, too—of the lightest timbre, that seems to
float out witlnput intention, with a peculiarly
clean-cut enunciation, and the softest tread on the
vowels just the voice you could imagine reading
1 dreamed that as T wandered by the way." But
not, oh ! not the voice to be travelling along the
sentiments incidental to the Jamberoo pig-show.
The question of eight hours for a Governor is
discussed. Since the beginning of thenew regime,
n , me c [ a y® His Ex. lias been to a picnic, to
church twice, to the Fresh Air League Ball,
Belle of New York,” Rand wick Races, Birthday
Review, Birthday dinner, levee, Mr. B. R. Wise’s
lecture on the Oxford Union, Art Gallery, and has
received deputations without end that still
continue to flow. _ Not that His Ex. finds weari-
ness in these things. If he feels any strain it
comes from his efforts to make himself familiar at
once with our customs and traditions, to master
the whole Science of Sydney straight off, as it
were. He is very bent on doing things thoroughly.
Sydney is also bent that way. At Port Said,
at three o clock m the morning, a cable burst in on
the Earl s slumbers. He supposed his ancestral
home had been burnt down. But there was no
explosion. It was only a cable to ask his Ex.’s
patronage and presence at a Sydney Charity Ball.
And it was then three o’clock in the morning.
Item : His Ex. is going to that ball.
•• . And those cables from London that
gave you every good and perfect gift ? ” He
smiles; a fleeting smile. Is there a suspicion of
cviiwT, • m lt? , Invi ff or atmg idea, that makes
everything easy from that point onwards. “ The
accusation of gardening is quite true; these
packets are bulbs I have brought with me from my
own garden. I looked for your wild flowers at
Western Australia, but it was not flower-time. I
had heard of the trains over there that take people
out to where the wild flowers grow in acres and
have no other plan than to stop where the flowers
are. . . . And those little pictures on the wall
are glimpses of my gardens The hobby has long
roots, you see.” p
Those little green pictures of flower-beds and
Hiiiglisn trees lead to bigger ones.
The rumor circulating among local artists that
His Ex. went through an art-course at Paris is
disposed of. “ No, I went to Paris to have my
portrait painted by Constant. Naturally I saw a
great deal of the studios; but I was painted—l did
not paint myself. Watts is getting old, and only
paints portraits at his own impulse now, but Con-
stant follows in the English school. That was why
1 went to him I brought out a portrait of my
father, painted by Watts. Would you care to see
it and other pictures ? ”
Through the entrance hall—now stained and
rug-covered through aesthetic portieres, into the
red drawing-room, into th« presence of Romney,
Reynolds, Greuze, Gainsborough, Watts, and
others.
Everyone told me it was a dangerous under-
taking to bring these pictures to Australia, but
ttiey have all arrived in good condition. ”
.. The Greuze hangs between the windows a
smiling, lovely little head,” with the canker
somewhere, you know not where, though you feel
it. Madame de Pompadour, wearing a cameo of
Loins XV. on her bracelet, looks down from the
other wall. A lady by Romney ; the same lady

lam called on to admire a little sketch, “'is
that bid Long’s?” I ask casually. “Oh, no Mr
Long belongs to the Society of Artists. This is
the Art bociety.
Now that was very quick of the week-old
Governor. Some people, Sydney patriots, who
J\ av ® bere all their lives, have not mastered
that difference yet.
. And then the daggers (there might be daggers
m talking of Sid Long as a member of the Art
SocietylMyrng in gleaming jewelled sheaths on
little tables There are daggers enough to
slaughter all the bores in Sydney, to clear Govt
House from the onslaughts of all the well-mean-
ing people in this city. His Ex.’s eye gleams as
he looks at those daggers. Also, he has brought
out a thousand books. (By the way, I saw several
Australian authors lying round. Have they just
arrived. .Or is it possible that Lord Hampden left
them behind ?) Only a few particular treasures have
been unpacked yet. There is a lovely Morris—“ The
Life and Death of Jason”—with Morris’s own
decorations—illuminations rather—and a Burne
Jones by way of frontispiece. And the “Faerie
Queene, with Walter Crane’s illustrations. And
one of the first “ Stones of Venice.” And the most
fascinating collection of specimens of Morris wall-
papers. The cables said nothing about wall-
papers, but I can assure you Lord Beauchamp has
studied the subject with affection, and those who
would like to put something soulful over the
drawing-room’s pink cabbage-roses are advised to
make haste.
Finally, I must tell you that Lord Beauchamp
and Lady Hampden have had a long conversa-
tion. They began to talk at six in the morning,
and went on till nine without stopping. Elieu !
lor a lot can be told in three hours. And how
I’d like to have been behind the door !
Musicians were sorry to see such a meagre house
at Friedenthal’s first concert. So thin was it that
in the interval the management invited the back
seats to come forward. Somehow there has never
been much talk in Sydney about this pianist. He
has been advertised, but it is talk that leads
people. Lady Mary Lygon lent her presence, and
brought with her the Dowager Lady Raglan, Lady
Bertha, Lady Violet, and private sec. By inspir-
ation everyone was high-necked and long-sleeved.
Hie V.R. party frocking was a matter of white
silk or black silk and was as simple as possible.
Ihe dowager wore a little white cap. Lady Mary
and Lady Violet, who is young and pretty and
dresses her hair smartly on top, wore white China
silks. The others were in black. And what a
notable thing it was to see a V.R. party taking in
a concert vvith gulps of delight; clapping like the
back rows instead of yawning all the time.
At first glance, Friedenthal’s personality is
almost repellent. A little man with a shock of
black hair brushed up from his forehead, a black
moustache and chin tuft, and an expression that
stretches like a blank wall over his face. His
playing is quiet and intellectual. At first, it was
discounted a little by his dull, uninterested looks.
Chopin and he are not very intimate with each
°f u r ’ The god of amber grapes and kisses, king
of the misty soul world, lord of love, was translated
with rather an earthy precision. But he plays
Beethoven well. The Waldstein sonata was
excellently done; not to the point of wild
enthusiasm, but with a fine head and splendid
technique. The bristly Rubenstein concerto
showed off more technique. As for his sentiment
and delicacy, these showed themselves at their
best m the ochubert-Liszt serenade.
Lord Beauchamp’s first visit to Randwick came
off on Queen’s Birthday, to the accompaniment of
ten thousand curious souls, and a bevy of well-
bred horses. And the presence round the vice-
regal box was not altogether due to women. Every
man on the course strolled past that box,
slowly. Lady Mary Lygon looked younger by day
than in a ball-dress. She wore a fetching little
jacket of pastel-blue cloth over three white
violet flounces. A mauve straw hat with paler
feathers and red roses under the brim created a
charming effect. Lady Violet Somerset showed
off an English complexion against a white coat
and skirt and a black tulle toque. His Ex. set all
fears at rest by his shiny bell-topper and otherwise
regulated garb. He wore no gloves, and walked
about a good deal with two men in pot-hats, who
interpreted the racecourse to him.
Once, Society was scared. It had lost sight of
the vice-regal party. Somehow, somewhere, they
had mysteriously escaped those ten thousand eyes.
I hen puffing, panting people discovered them over
the fence, deep in conversation with Mr. Tom
Watson. They were waiting to see the start of
the race, in the usual English way.
The dressing was very much in earnest. Miss
Grace Noble wore a slim black frock strapped
crossways across the placket hole, and a little
grebe toque witli rosettes of cherry velvet. Mrs.
W. B. Mitchell, was also in black, with a long
train, a fringed fichu of black velvet and a tur-
quoise blue toque. One of the prettiest frocks on
the lawn was Mrs. Ted Simpson’s Eton coat and
skirt of white serge, worn with a violet toque.
Every shade of mauve, from lavender grey to
burning purple, was seen over and over again.
Miss Kitty Smart was in bright mauve cloth with
lace revers on an Eton jacket, a very high collar,
and a little mauve hat trimmed with pink rosebuds.
The Fresh Air League ball was the medium that
introduced the new Gov. to society as a dancing-
man. With the order of the Garter on his chest,
an official ribbon round his neck, and a button-
hole of Czar violets, His Ex. drove the crowded
galleries into ecstasies of admiration. Even a
month-old baby was moved to tears. But what
unthinking cruelty to obstruct the gallery railing
just c 'or the sacred dais with yards of prickly
palms : This spot is always rushed by those who
take two-shillingsworth of “ look-on, ” and a wild
herd of girls scratched their faces against the
greenery as they hung over to drink-in everything.
In the intervals of admiration, tea and coffee went
off briskly in the gallery corridors.
In the opening Lancers, Lady Darley, in black
with a blue feather in her hair, danced with His
Ex. If that first advance and retreat was a ner-
vous one for somebody, Lady Darley covered the
situation with maternal stateliness; in fact, the
galleries agreed that no one could have done it
better. Lady Mary Lygon was rather staidly
frocked in dull-yellow brocade with a mauve
pattern, cut without any train. The bodice was
draped with lace, and ended in a mauve ribbon at
the waist; a diamond chain and pendant fell over
her chest; and a dazzling tiara of ten diamond
shamrocks crowned her hair, which she wears
half way up her head. Lady Bertha Wilbraham,
the pleasant-faced friend of Lady Mary, made her
first public appearance in a long black satin frock,
with white roses in her hair. Also, in the V.R.
lancers were the aides, who haven’t the spruce
carriage of other aides, and, in fact, hang their
heads rather badly. Of course this may be merely
a sort of complimentary failing, like the Alexandra
limp, as His Ex. stoops at the shoulders con-
spicuously.
Bright tones led the ball-dressing. White frocks
sported red chiffon sashes and long red feathers
in the hair. Pink frocks were no longer of the
rose of yesteryear shade ; they glared m all the
lurid tints between a cherry-stain and a back-
block sunset. Light pink is entirely dead. Blue
was also a matter of much pigment. Sapphire,
turquoise, ultramarine, indigo, but no soft ceru-
leans, none of the old washed-sky blue.
<A rocked Australienne (Miss Kitty
Smart, of Singleton, who travelled in the Hima-
S°kL the sanie .voyage as His Ex.), behind a big
l ink bouquet with her hair dressed aggressively
mounted with pink roses, danced the
hrst waltz with the Governor. Mrs. Herbert
Marks wore her presentation frock, a white silk
brocaded superbly with great red carnations, and
a naming feather in her hair. Mrs. Pearson was
in an accumulated toilette of olive satin with pale
green chiffon elbow-sleeves, jetted revers, and
pink roses. Grace Noble looked unprofessional in
a girlish white brocade. Pretty Miss Oliver
adorned a pale green polonaise over steel and pink
flounces. .Nobody could tell who belonged to a
rock, white to the knees only, garlanded with red
poppies and livened up with yards of red and
white ribbons falling from the shoulder. The hair
was « la pigtail, but the Beauchamp colors were
carefully carried out with feathers on the fringe.
1 his, and the month-old baby, were the youngest
compliments I noticed. I have come to the con-
clusion that you will see anything at a charity ball
it you look long enough. I saw a black frock, with
the left side of the bodice black and the right side
gieen, and up the arms ran long green gloves, like
verdigris up a neglected candlestick. And another
innovation was Hetty Holroyd singing “God Save
the Queen ” at 12 o’clock.
Some coming balls are the Tempe ball, at the
town Hall, Wednesday, June 14th; the Foundling
Home ball, in the Paddington Town Hall, Wednes-
day, June 7th; Manly Cottage Hospital ball,
Aquarium Hall, Manly, on Wednesday, 21st June.
Hi new music from Paling and Co. there is of
course, ‘ The Beauchamp Waltz, ”byE. M. Town
which changes agreeably after its'opening clan*
and becomes as poetic, nearly, as its namesake’.
• u °f federation, ” by Elsie Hope Wallace,
is dedicated lo All irue Australians, and deserves
to be encouraged for that reason, and because it
only covers one sheet. “ Nebraska, ” a schottisehe
with its time well marked, by Alfred E. Perkins
rings like a wail from the past in these days when
the schottisehe is nothing but an unhappy
memory, bydney Hoben’s “Fairer than All” is
an accommodating ballad that allows the singer
the choice of “Tell him (or her) my love is as
boundless seas, Tell him (or her) my heart is
ever his (or her) own, Tell him (or her) I live for
him (or her), love hun (or her) alone.” I cannot
conscientiously recommend it to the man who
sings last at a smoke concert. A thin tenor pas-
sionately and mistakenly declaring “My heart is
ever his own” would be too pathetic for other men
at that time of night. Hammond and Co. send
along a new song by May Pettifer, called “Moon-
light.’ The words are Tom Moore’s, the arpeg-
gios and six flats are Miss Pettifer’s. It strikes
me as a clever, difficult song, without the slightest
resemblance to Moonlight or Lady Hampden, who
specially permits “ the dedication.”
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The R.C. clergy rolled up in force to Amy
Castles’ benefit concert, even the austere Dean
M‘Kcnna lending the light of his countenance.
The young lady is herself R.C., and Father
Robinson, of St. Francis’, is one of the most in-
fluential members of the committee which pro-
poses to send her to Europe to a convent to be
educated, while she is at the same time completing
her musical studies.
“Full dress was the order of the day in all
parts of the house at Amy Castles’ benefit-concert,
the opera-cloaks being especially gorgeous. Lady
Brassey wore a lovely full-length cloak of real
Paddy green trimmed with white fur, while bril-
liant yellows, pinks and blues glittered all over
the hall. The yellow facings of the four aides
were conspicuous among the black coats of the
other men and the unrelieved blackness of the
numerous priests, while the jewelled trimmings
on the dresses of half the women in the hall made
the scene a glittering feast of color. One young
priest was overheard remarking that it reminded
him of a, festival-scene on the piazza in front of
St. Peter’s, Rome, the colors were so vivid and so
bright, and the sea of faces from floor to ceiling,
all turned in one direction, were so intent on the
one central figure in white.
“ The letter with the name of ‘ Amy Castles ’ at
the foot of it which the Argus published on the
morning after her benefit concert was merely an
outrage against Melbourne’s common-sense—noth-
ing more. Everybody who has any acquaintance
with the damsel and her history up to date is
aware that she didn’t compose the journalesy
epistle. A good many people would like to know
whether she had even a small say in the descrip-
tion of the marmalade, and, if so, why she didn’t
suggest a kindly reference to the women who
‘ made ’ her. There were thanks for the Governor
and Lady Brassey, and ‘ the many leading citizens
who, by their presence, proved to me (Amy C.)
the interest they take in an Australian native
and Mr. Alfred Cornish, and Mr. George Allan,
and ‘last and most especially Mr. L. L. Lewis’
who inaugurated the movement, and to whose
untiring exertions its success is very largely to be
attributed 9 —but never a word of thanks for the
* discoverers 9 from whose care Amy was captured
as soon as tho discovery had become famous.
Therefore, lastly and especially, it would be in-
teresting to learn the name of the real author of
the young lady’s burst of gratitude.
“ Amy Castles will have achieved her Exhibi-
tion triumph when this is printed. At present
the lucky young woman walks on air, intoxicated
with praise, prospects, &c. Her future evidently
looks rosy to her advisers, when they decline on
her behalf J. C. Williamson’s offer of education
for her, and maintenance for herself and mother
in Europe for three years, besides a weekly allow-
ance of £3 all that time. This is said to be worth
£3OOO, and in return Miss Amy would sing for two
years for her floater. The hardest-to-please of
local musicians describes the girl as ‘a born
artist ’ who ‘ does but sing because she must, and
pipes but as the linnets do ! ’
“Everyone wore her new winter things to that
Salon gathering, hostessed by Mesdames Quinnell
and Lugg. The latter aired suit and toque of the
new dull magenta. Her pretty daughter sported
the short, trim fawn jacket of the moment with
stock and cravat of ivory lace. These tight tan
coatees are all the go, and what with small sleeves,
unwidened shoulders, and plain skirts, wearers
look (till one grows accustomed to the sight of
‘ beauty unadorned ’) as chastened as if they were
off to a forenoon tract-distribution.
“Social lionesses of the occasion were Lady
Holled-Smith (in brown blouse splashed with
white, and green hat covered with violets), Mrs.
Wesley-Hall and sister (in fawn jackets), and
Lady Davies. Minnie Waugh and Luscombe
helped with the programme. The latter was par-
ticularly acceptable in “Bandoliers ! ” His Orien-
tal exuberance seems appropriate to vocal brigand-
age and sich. By the way, said singer’s benefit
happens next month.
“The ‘Forty Thieves ’ petticoat-brigade are
bright Australian girls with Victoriennes as
principals. So far as dainty Carrie Moore is con-
cerned, Ada Reeve didn’t visit this side in vain.
Susie-usie smilefulness and winning little ways
of cajoling an audience, stamp little Moore as
a willing walker in the way that she should go.
Rose Musgrove, an improvement on her Geisha
form, still prefers pout, shrug and cheeky-cheek to
honey-sweet stage tactics. That ‘ beauty-of-the-
harem’ profile of hers goes well with Oriental
surroundings. Ccsca Vollugi, her very own
golden hair rippling over her ears, is perhaps the
belle of the bunch, though at present too mild,
ladylike and subdued to ‘ knock ’ anyone but
‘ minx ’-hating old ladies.
“ It could hardly have been the desire for cheap-
ness that induced Gov. Brassev to give a State
concert instead of the usual Queen’s Birthday
Ball. He put the musical programme into the
hands of Benno Seherek, and, from that point
of view, the thing was done well. But it was a
tame, flabby sort of affair. Things seemed off-
color. Society prefers a romp to an artistic treat,
and loves to troop off to supper after the appetite
has been sharpened by dancing instead of being
tamely marched off at the end of a formal pro-
gramme, like boarding-school boys and girls to a
meal. People said it was ‘very naice’ at the
time, but the subsequent comments have been
bitter. Ihe grievance of the women is that they
could not see what everybody had on ; and of the
men, that ‘ there was no fun in a concert such as
one can have at the Town Hall for a bob any
Saturday.’ So even in the new move the Gover-
nor has failed to please. And he does try so
hard, poor old man ! But he won’t succeed by
trying to ‘educate public taste.’
“ The giddier portion of Melbourne’s 800 stayed
away from the Birthday evening party at Govern-
ment House. They had tasted the raptures of
sundry small and naice gatherings at the same in-
stitution when they sat like honey-pots all in a
row and listened to the band, and so they were
not taking any-on a larger scale even to celebrate
the Queen’s octogenarianity. Their Excellencies
and suite gave themselves no end of trouble (and
no little expense) to set the martyr guests yawning
under cover of the white-and-gold programme.
By the way, Duncan Gillies, while exchanging
how-do’s with a brother politician’s wife at the
party aforesaid, put his fingers to his delicate ears
and piteously asked if nothing could be done to
stop that awful laugh. Of course it was Chief
Secretary Peacock’s.
Y ours affectionately,
GOULI-GOULI.

“ Merited distinctions are the necessary

gram, well worth preserving, and taken from B. R.
Wise’s lecture on the “Oxford Union,” was in-
spired by the assertions of the anti-federalists that
Barton and Reid are out for federal billets.
Tas. Governor Gorrnanston is going to
spend his leave at his place at Gormanstown, near
Balbriggan (County Dublin), where the hosiery
comes from. The Gonnanstons were always known
in Ireland as Gormanstowns, but the “w” has
been lately knocked out to make the name look
less Irish.

Dear Bulletin.— Be that Noumea corres-
pondent’s exception to my statement that Dillon
was the first discoverer of the remains of La
Perouse’s expedition. The French Govt, of the
day was at all events satisfied enough on that head
lo give Dillon the Legion of Honor cross and a
■£4oo a year pension. And what was good enough
i >r the F.G., ought surely to be good enough for
the Noumea-man. —O.J.
The benevolent Ex-Juage Forbes, nowon
pension, turned his 80th year last week, and was
remembered on his birthday by many sections of
the community. The ex-Judge is in feeble health,
and seldom leaves his home at Darlinghurst. On
bis own account, and because he is the son of
Australia’s first Chief-Justice—the man who in-
troduced trial by jury and conferred the first ele-
ments of freedom on the local press—the ex-Judge
deserves kindly regard.
King O’Malley is luxuriating in Melbourne
after his defeat at S.A. general election. He ex-
plains that America is very sore that a S.A. con-
stituency should have rejected him, and wishes
dim to return to enter Congress. He doubts
whether he will, however, as, having been born on
the Canadian side, he cannot become President of
i lie United States, unless the U.S. annexes his
native town to make him eligible. He has his eye
upon a Vic. constituency.
There recently died in Brewarrina, N.S.
Wales, John Smythe, one of the first white men
to settle on the Barwon 53 years ago. He had
never since been away from the district, and had
curious tales of the early days. Once when he
and bis mate ran short of tobacco they tossed up
to see who would go to their nearest neighbor (200
miles away !) for a supply. It fell to the mate to
go, and Smythe had to keep inside the hut till his
return, the blacks being then very aggressive.
The Mr. Watson Murdoch who wrote on
Australian poetry in the Argus t’other day crowed
about bis copyright trick of taking a line from
each of five BuLLETrN bards, and making a verse
of them. Then he says: “You could not play
such tricks with the genuine poets.” Perhaps
Milton, Pope, Shakespeare, Gray and Wordsworth
are not among Mr. Murdoch’s “ genuine poets,”
but the late Laman Blanchard “wrote ” an eight-
verse poem called “ An Ode to the Human Heart,”
composed entirely of lines from the biggest poets.
Here is the first verse :
Blind Thamyris and Maconides
Pursue the triumph and partake the gale I
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees,
To point a moral and adorn a tale.
In which the lines are respectively from Milton,
Pope, Shakespeare and Dr. Johnson. Mr. Mur-
doch’s dogma has a big hole in it.
Q. Chief- Justice Griffith is the ardent
friend of Federation, and he has been its acti ve
enemv. When he re-introduced kanaka-labor, he
gave'the vested sugar-interests their best reason
for fighting white Australia. Now the theoretical
Federalist sits watching the chiokens of the prac-
tical anti-Federalist come home to roost.
Gov. Brassey begins to talk of “ When the
—er—um—time comes for—for—for—er— Lady

His Ex. has made two references to the happy day

Carlyle Smythe, interviewing French
General Dodds for the Abgus : “ I do not know
how it is with others, but I always find an Im-
mense charm in meeting great men who are not
giants ; and I love to remember that Napoleon
was but a trifle over five feet.” Ah, and t.ien
there is that other great man, the Much-1 ravelled
—he is only about four feet odd.
A member of Premier Reid’s lately-ap-
pointed Sydney Labor Board is Rev. Dr. Zillmann,
who, as stump-orator to the unemployed, has
been in evidence for some time past. Dr. Zill-
mann is the son of a Moravian pastor, brought to
Brisbane by Dr. Lang in his immigration fleet
over 50 years ago. The present Zillmann was born
at German Station, near Brisbane.
Jack Want writes from London that he
hopes to be in Sydney before the date of the
Referendum “in time to put another nail in the
coffin of the bill.” As, however, the Oruba, by
which he has taken passage, is timed to reach
Adelaide on June 19, the day before the voting,
Disunion Jack will, probably, arrive just in
time to attend the pauper-funeral of the Geebung

Three dozen ex-Ministers of the Crown

GOLF AT BONDI . THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF AUSTRALASIA.
London Truth, it fa cabled, that
Queen Victoria is suffering from cataract, and
that a celebrated German oculist ad vises opera-
tion, of the success of which he is confident.
The widow of the late N.S.W. ex-Premier
J. S. Farnell, who died the other day. is the only
Australian woman on record known to have suc-
cessfully objected to her husband receiving a title.
Apropos, of the eight Ministers of the Farnell
Cabinet of 1877, two—H. E. Cohen and W. J.
Foster—reached N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench.
Cohen still sits ; Foster retired on pension. Of
the rest, four are dead, and the two remaining—
W. H. Suttor and J. F. Burns—are out of active
politics.
Morgan Darcy, found dead alongside a
railway line in Westralia lately, had been a con-
spicuous figure on numerous new mining fields.
He pioneered Silverton and Broken Hill, and was
early at Kalgoorlie. Whenever there was a race-
meeting to be organised or a glove-fight to be
refereed Darcy was handy ; always the pal of the
men who made the biggest “pots” in mining, he
was too busy enjoying himself to reach after the
lucre on his own account, and probably died as
poor as the poorest of them.
The Nineteenth Century article on
Federation by Baron Brassey is a flabby produc-
tion with all real points of interest carefully
avoided. The bones of contention over which the
provinces are wrangling have been overlooked
from start to finish. There is not even a reference
to the Federal capital site question ! While
dozens of men who know the subject from A to Z
are willing to turn out trenchant copy for 20s. a
column, Baron Brassey, in the ignorance which
he so carefully acquired while fal ing off things in
Melbourne, probably draws .£lO9 for his balder-
dash. And it will probably be the most-quoted
article on Australian Federation in the world !

like a white-whiskered owl, “ir.ayl ask if you
are a descendant of the celebrated Admiral Ben-

lawyer. “ Well, I should think it likely,” went
on the P.M. “Every second word the Admiral
used to utter was an oath, and you seem to have
inherited the complaint. Go on, sir.”
Sir Frederick McCoy, Melbourne Uni-
versity’s 82-year-old Prof, of Natural Science, who
wore stays, dyed his hair and resorted to other
expedients to make himself look youthful, was
quite out-of-date as a scientist. For 30 years it is
said he never made a verbal alteration in the
lectures he gave his classes year after year. Like
those most ignorant of Darwin, he was always on
the look-out for an opportunity to sneer at the
theory of evolution. Prof. McCoy was like old
Baron Yon Mueller in one particular—he had a
great opinion of his title. But whereas Von
Mueller liked being a baron as a compliment to his
science, the other man took his knighthood as a
compliment to McCoy, and reckoned himself all
the better for it.
A marvellous old man is Robert Herbert,
who takes Saul Samuel’s late office of president of
London Colonial Club. He seems to be standing,
around in London waiting on representatives of
Australian provinces to grow too old for their
billets or to meet with some accident, whereupon he
notifies the authorities that he is ready to take up
the duties temporarily or permanently. He has
been Acting-Agent-General for several provinces
when they were tightly pushed, and general ad-
viser and jobber for all. Premier of Queensland
nearly 40 years ago, he has made a few re-
cords. He was Queensland’s youngest Premier,
28 years, and held the Premiership longest, prac-
tically six years. He also held the Under-Secre-
taryship for the Colonies for 21 years, another re-
cord.
Arthur Morgan, the new Q. Speaker, is a
native of Warwick (Q.), and has lived mainly on
politics and leading-articles. Until three years
ago he was a prominent member of the Opposition,
and was invariably found in concert with Drake,
Powers, Groom and co. Like Powers, he became
disgusted with the Labor-party in ’96, and re-
tired to private life—returning, again like Powers,
at late elections as a Ministerialist, The reward
of his apostacy is the Speakership ; Powers, an
abler man, fell in the mud. However, the amiable
Morgan, who is a fair, if somewhat ponderous and
measured orator, rises high above paltry party
bias and personal animosities —qualities very con-
spicuous in his cavalier predecessor. Also, Mor-
gan was Chairman of Committees for some years,
and has mastered the standing-orders.
“M‘G.” preaches a sermon :
The mail that brings news of Griffo’s incarceration in a
Yankee lunatic asylum chronicles also the prowess in
Samoa of Lieut. Gaunt (Judge Gaunt’s son). Writer was
at school with Gaunt, and has intimate friends who knew
Griffo from childhood, and the careers of the two up to
now are striking instances of the effect of environment.
The pug., according to all accounts, was a very ordinary
kid ; whereas Gaunt, as a lad, was utterly unmanageable.
He had heaps of pluck ; and, though there was nothing
inherently bad in him, he was a standing danger to
scholastic discipline. But while Gaunt had all the ad-
vantages of education and refinement, Griffo was battling
for a living with an armful of newspapers ; while Gaunt
has heen settling down to steady business as a hero,
Griffo has been exchanging pugdom for dementia. Had
the Rocks lad entered the navy at the same time as
Gaunt, the Australian dailies would probably be record-
ing the deeds of another of our own boys on behalf of
Old England.
“Old Jack ” : Be statement that Mowbray
Morris, “ now of London Times,” wrote “ A
Voice from the Bush,” I want to say that if
Morris be now on London Times he must be the
oldest journalist on two legs. Fifty years ago,
remember him as a man considerably over 40. His
younger brother, John Walters Morris, was my
tutor, and he was no chicken. As a matter of fact,
Mowbray Morris is dead. Also, as a matter of
fact, he died without writing “ A Voice from the
Bush.” He knew no more about the bush than
the sea-serpent. His brother, John Walters
Morris, knew a lot about it. But he wasn’t a poet
—only a pedant. That’s so. [Mowbray Morris is
the only man who ever claimed to write the
“ Voice ; ” and as he wrote distinctly that he did,
he can have the little credit there is. Either he
or another Mowbray Morris edits Macmillan’s
Magazine.]

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buver of all other Australian gems.*
Mr. S. A. Palmer, the enthusiastic pro-
phet of Vitadatio, pays all his employes, from
managers to messengers, liberal salaries and
wages, and takfes pride in being a wealth as well
as a health distributor; consequently there was a
good deal of genuineness about the enthusiasm
shown at the spread tendered to Mr. and Mrs.
Palmer by the firm’s employes at the Melbourne
Protestant Hall the other day. Mrs. Palmer was
presented with a handsome gold watch and chain,
and Mr. P. with, among other things, an illumin-
ated address. .Vitadatio has been one of the
rapidest booms in the history of patent medicine-
enterprise. The latest evidence of the develop-
ment of .the business is the taking over of the
large brick warehouse (formerly Eerguson and
Mitchell’s) in South Melb., for the manufactureof
this popular herbal remedy. A Vitadatio branch
will shortly be opened in Sydney.*

As we rode on the dusty plains,
If Kipling wants to “ scream with the painted
loues on “ the dusty plains ” he’ll have to carry
them with him in a gin-case and prod ’em with a
stick occasionally, ‘‘Bunty Tom” knows (evi-
dently) what he’s talking about ; Kipling and the
E. News critic don’t. Poetry in Australia is im-
proving much; poets more. We straight-haired
natives, therefore, expect wonders from the poet-
crop of 1900. Surely by then some “pote” will
sing sweetly of the antics of the emu when diving
after sharks in Port Jackson. If not, why not?

Walter Hall, the Broken Hillionaire, tells
the story of an old-time whip whose line of coaches
stopped running, and who applied to Hall to get
him a. seat on a Sydney ’bus. Walter had no
hesitation in recommending the man, yet from
the time he left Circular Quay there was never a
break in his career of accident. Cabs, buggies,
other ’buses—he collided so impartially with the
lot that his employer complained to Hall, who was
perplexed, and asked for explanation. “Look
here. Bill, / know there’s not a better driver than
you in the West; I’ve been on your coach when
you took her between saplings with not a sheet of
paper to spare. How do you account for all this
trouble?” “Well, Mr. Hall, the only way I can
account for it is this. When I’m in the bush the
trees, and the rocks, and the holes, they all stand
still, you see ; and a fellow knows where to find
|em; but down George-street the cabs and
’buses they always keep moving. For God’s sake,
Mr. Hall, get me a place out-back where things is
fixed, and not hickory-shickory like a blanky
jumping-jack! ”

About hares jumping. Years ago the
first few pairs were acclimatised at Pentridge
Stockade. When the Acclimatisation Society
wished to distribute the animals over the country
the custom was to organise a grand beat, drive
the hares into the angle formed by the junction
of two stone walls, and then drive them back
again into a net 4ft. high stretching from wall to
wall. Occasionally a
hare would leap clean
over this net.

“ Mars ” : Sheep-stealing has flourished
of late in a Southern district. Complaints to the
local constable have had little effect. He pro-
mises much, rides hard in the wrong direction,
sniffs wildly at the wrong scent, evolves extraor-
dinary theories, and is careful to catch no one.
And the reason : he is a dairy-farmer at heart,
and the little gaol, fitted up with shelves, makes
such a cool and admirable dairy that it would be
a thousand pities to disturb the cream by placing
unruly sheep-stealers among the pans." So the
town drunkard, and the station-hands in for a
spree, paint the place red, while the constable
rides frantically with loaded pistol in the direction
in which the thieves are hot, and, on his return,
drunks and disorderlies are safe asleep under hay-
stacks or in drains, and there is no need to put
them in the lock-up, either. And the cream rises
thick and yellow in its innocent abode.

the lady carried on the business till the town policeman
reckoning that she would be a most valuable aid in
securing the larger-sized drunks, induced her to share his

fortified by some years with the fore-hammer, she

Burragorang : When a boy, often saw
black-gins fighting, and they always used sticks
about sft. long and lin. in dia. The gin on the
defensive always hopped on one leg ; and when
as often happened, the stick flew out of the attack-
ing gin’s hands, the other always caught it in the
air between toes of left foot, and slung it many
yards over the head of the attacking gin. This
“passing of the kip,”so to speak, was a signal for
th© combatants to change places. The gin on th©
defensive always held the stick at each end, and
the way violent blows were parried was astonish-
ing. No thrusts or “pokes” were ever made, and
the air was thick with spit and froth, and “yah”
and “ugh.” Only once did I see a blow “get
home, cutting the head to the bone from eye-
brow to nape, and. ending the battle. Other fights
I have seen ended just as suddenly by my father’s

Doleful Domesticity.
It is a sad sight to see a husband arrive home
from a hard day’s work to find the breakfast-table
not cleared, no signs of dinner, and no loving wife
to street him at the entrance door.
Such a condition of affairs is seldom seen in
Australia, unless the wife is tied to the lounge or
bed with disease. Headaches, nausea, backaches,
seeming total collapse and inability to stir, will
come to most of us occasionally, and you can
safely charge it to the liver.
More homes have been brightened, and faces
made beaming with health and happiness, through
using Warner’s Safe Cure, than any medicine on
earth. There is not a man or woman in Australia
whose circle of friends is so small that they have
not a friend who has told them plainly : “ War-
ner’s Safe Cure put me right when my liver was
bad and kidneys weak.” You know it; your
friends’ experiences ought to be a fairly good
guide.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Dear Bulletin.—lf I may venture a prophecy
n a game where the unexpected is always happening, I
will “ tip ” the present Australian Eleven to be not beaten
in any of the five test matches, though they may not
score a victory every time. Their performance against
Grace’s team—allowing for the fact that the local men
have only lately come out of a long winter vacation,an
are, consequently, less fit than the visitors after a health-
ful five or six weeks’ holiday on the ocean-seems to put
the Australians beyond the possibility of Fating beaten
on a good wicket in a three days’ match. They knocked
up 375 runs for 10 wickets, and their rate of scoring was
much faster than the Englishmens. This, wh's* l , l ®
accordance with their Australian form against Stoddart
and Co., is a reversal of things as they were m the times
when Lord Sheffield prepared warm receptions for them.
Then the Englishmen were the more aggressive batsmen,
but now they seem to have abandoned all hope of sooring
rapidly against the Australian bowling, and—on paper—
they are fearful of defeat. If the representative
South of England Eleven could do nothing more
than potter, what probability is there of All-England
beating Australia within three days on a batsman s
wicket ? Sticky-wicket matches are not worth consider-
ing for test purposes, seeing that a few fluky hits niay
turn the game in favor of one side or t’other, but, given
an equal division of luck, the side that includes the best
bowlers, and is not afraid to slog, ought to mostly will in
bad weather also. Formerly I was a loyal barracker for
All-England, because A.E. seldom failed to score faster
than the other fellows, but since the Australians have
begun to play a fairly dashing game, I’ve given my old
friends up as a bad job.— Britisher.

and wrestling competition in grounds of Tivoli Hotel.

around, quite dwarfing the biggest of our passengers,
and looking so fierce that most of us thought the ‘ view ’

by local policeman Sullivan, half Irishman, half Samoan
(what a mixture for a scrap !), who was referee, bottle-
holder, and chucker-out all in one. When the gloves
were thrown into the ring there was no ‘ skite,’ but a
rush for the ‘ mittens,’ and a ‘ go ’ that lay over anything
ever seen in an Australian hall. Little science; but,
snak :s! how those chaps could hit—putting in the whole
weight of the body, so that when a blow did get home
down went the recipient, an inert mass, to be heaved out
of the ring to his friends for resuscitation. Some Vic.
sports induced one of the ship’s firemen with a Sydney
boxing reputation to tackle the local champion, Vainga,
who knocked him dead to the world in the second round.”

There are many theories about the M.L. “ horse-
fiend.” One, that he is a disappointed backer, who has
vowed to destroy all race-horses. Another—based upon
the fact that the stallions killed have been mutilated in a
certain way—is that he is a fantastic specimen of the sex-
lunatic. Yet a third is that he is an expert “ vet.”, this
assumption being founded upon his skilful manner of
killing the animals by stabbing.them in a vulnerable part,
mortally wounding them with one blow. So firmly was
the latter theory held that a “ vet.” who is a bit eccentric
was “ shadowed ” for some weeks, but without success.
If he had been homeless and penniless, instead of being in
good practice, he would doubtless have been arrested,
badgered and “identified,” as Burgess was. The black-
tracker employed to find the fiend proved a howling
failure, and has made tracks for Queensland. A whole
detachment of policemen is now sent out nightly to prowl
around the paddocks and stables near Christchurch in the
hope of catching the slaughterer at work. The “ fiend ”
seems to know when he is watched, and so long as the
guard is on duty no horses are killed. Some weeks ago,
the authorities ordered the “specials” to cease watching,
and the very first night they were off duty another
valuable horse was slaughtered.
At Rangiora (M.L.), lately, a 20 to 1 chance

again. This time, latter drew weight. _ Sca|es were sub-
sequently found to be cronk. In the interim, owner of
winner was gravely advised to strip the horse of his
brush-shoes, and was proceeding to do so. The crowd
roared. Of course, the neddy carried shoes as well as
jock, &c., but rider did not weigh-out with them. A
unique point.

At Melb. District Court, recently, a police-con-
stable summoned a professional sport for money alleged
to be due to him as part owner of a racing mare. Ihe
“ bobby” said he nominated the mare for several events
and was to get £l5 if she won a certain stake but after
the animal had duly done the trick he couldn t persuade
his pal the trainer to part up more than £lO. Also, the
trainer threatened to “ report him to the sergeant if he
made a fuss. The fact that the humble bobby took his
grievance into court suggests that he had no occasion to
keep his Turf dealings dark. Report him to the sergeant
for keeping a racehorse ! Why, if there were no owners
there would be no betting, no tote-shops or cigar shops to
raid, no captures of punters in the public thoroughfare,
or “ dead-birds ” for the foorce to put its shirt on.

Westralian goldfields’ opinion is riven on the

reached the boiled-shirt stage, and decided to go on as
of old. The position therefore is that Kalgoorlie must
either repent of its virtue or lose the matches, which will
then be played at the other centres ; and as football-bar-
racking induces thirst, and thirst means trade, Kalgoorlie
wobbles.

The Myers-George running matches which gave

’Murkan man’s sudden death, a few' weeks back. Lou.
Myers was probably the fastest track-runner of all time,
and yet in George he met one who went very near to
beating him over all distances. Each man on his own
looked incomparable—when they came together, Myers
proved himself the boss up to half-a-mile. At three-
quarters the bigger man was boss, not because Myers
couldn’t stay, but because his long-striding rival had
wonderful speed for his size. After them came the
Deluge, as far as footracing is concerned.

severe punching about the caput must rattle the brain-
box a bit. Strangely enough, newspaper critics of the
game often get the taint-.
While certain American States have declared
penal the wearing of bloomers by cyclists, the St. Peters-

lately vacated by Prendergast. There are signs
that—possibly by way of preparation for the] ex-
alted position—he may soon be an ex-prohibi-
tionist in addition to all his other “ ex ’’-ness.
appeared, the other day, before Wellington Ap-
peal Court as principal counsel for a brewery, and
argued most eloquently for the enforcement of a
covenant between the bung concern and the land-
lord of a “ tied ” house. He was as convincing
upon the beer-seller’s rights as if he had all his life
blown the froth off the unregenerate pewter.

E.A.C. : The Bulletin’s feelings on the Boer-
Uitlander question are very mixed. This paper likes
neither the Boers nor their enemies, the mine-mono-
polists of the Chartered Co., who are at the bottom of
most of the trouble. There is nothing for an outsider to
be enthusiastic about in the present situation Fancy :
Poem to the dreaming maid whom you kissed in her
sleep doesn’t explain whether she was in bed or had just
dropped off on the sofa. In former case, your presence
calls for explanation 6.Y.H. : Miss Ina Wildman
(“ Sappho Smith”) died 15th Nov., 1896. The Bulletin
is glad to note from your enquiry that the brightest and
most valued of its writers is still remembered in
Australia. John Drayman’s verses appeared 28th Nov.
B.B. : Birthstain poetry is already a drug in
the market Ah Kee: Too sultry. Scrub your narra-
tive. E.L.A.: “There’s very little in Australia that’s
original.” True: “ There’s nothing new under the sun.’J
F.R.W.: Judging by your stories of animal-torture,
you move in a circle where a little hard kicking and even
hanging would not be amiss Alias : Brown’s life must
remain spoiled. Not utterly bad, but a tale with no love,
no woman, no dog, no human passion, lacks salt. A man
and a mystery in the cash are dry materials Q.U.E. :
All the same, that proviso in the Federal' Bill that none
of these lumbering States shall be divided without its
own consent (which isn’t likely to be given) will make
awful trouble some day Stiletto: “Peter” style flat
and characters unconvincing .... P.T.O. : The fact that
the man was a general disfavorite would have been no
reason for increasing his punishment; and, as you appear
yourself to have been one of the “ kettlers,” you are, of
course, prejudiced. In any case, The Bulletin would
make it justifiable homicide to “pot” the “kettler”
after due warning Saltbush : Unluckily most of the cash
is on the anti-Bill side. The bulk of the Fat Men are there.
....T.S.N. (Narandera): If Federation hadn’t as many lives
as 999 cats, your poetry would have killed it stone-dead.
G. W. (Summer Hill) : In a joint sitting of the Federal
House, supposing there are 109 members in all, there
must be 55 votes in favor of the proposed Bill to carry it.
Under these circumstances there mustn’t be absentees.
Probably there will be a “ call of the House ” on impor-
tant cases—when every member must attend under pain
of heavy fine or something.. ..The Jacobite: (1) When
registering child you will be asked date of marriage, and
if you pass the lady off as your wife and the child as
legitimate, you will be liable to heavy penalties. Legally,
it should be registered in her married name. (2). You
must describe her in your will by her maiden name and
married name. If you call her, say, “my wife, J. 5.,”
when she isn’t, the chances are she will lose the property.
(3) In registering death, must describe her by her own
married name, and child by her name. (4) Illegal to pass
her off as your wife to benefit-society. (5) Don’t think
court would give him possession of child. Anyhow,
refuse to give it up, and 100 to 1 he w'on’t proceed. If
you have the means go to the States; let the lady
get a cheap Yankee divorce and marry her there
Centralian : The Bulletin wears a red cover because, for
one thing, red is the Republican color. Also (mixing biz.
with sentiment) red is the best advertising color because
it is the most conspicuous of colors. In the street you
see first that which is red—a red nose, for instance
Joe : Could make nothing of your scrawl, except that it
has “ bagmen ” in it and typhus fever —which is a cheer-
ful combination! J.M.A. : Can’t here discuss Mosaic
custom referred to. Now, if The Bulletin were a medical
paper! C.W. : The clerics in question have big sala-
ries, but high Heaven alone knows how they spend those
salaries. Perhaps in champagne and patAde-foie gras, per-
haps in secret charity. All the same, how can any bishop
who reckons himself a Christian have the front to show
off in a lordly equipage before the starvelings of the street ?
Frank : Story good ; moral all wrong. Gaolers are,
unfortunately, a necessity. If you persuade the people
that the billet is an utterly degrading one, then only
utterly degraded men will take it. And it wants humane,
intelligent men A.W.N.: You haven’t grasped it. If
a man says he is a liar he is a liar. If he tells the truth
now in saying he is a liar at most other times, then
he is a liar at most other times. If he tells a lie
now by saying he is a liar at most other times,
then he is a liar now. Either way he’s a liar.
J.T.: No abuse of Holy Rain just now .. .Bookworld : Too
recondite.. F.C.: Spoilt by the fact that Scotch Pres-
byterian clergymen are not illiberal in their views as to
workmen’s wages, and, on the whole, are good demo-
A DOMAIN IDYLL.
OLD TOURIST ( to one picking his teeth): “Lor,
Bill! have yer had a feed? ”
BILL ( with a sigh): “No; this is yesterday's
breakfast.”
crats E.L.A.: We don’t wish to hear about the Slat-
terys; we hope that all who write or talk about them
will be thunderstruck Coro (M.L.): We only want
items of wide interest—not petty details. How is the
place getting along? P.A.K.: Tell “ Lies ” elsewhere.
.... R.B. (Adelaide): Your sneer at the paragraph in
question was not justified. The police information
against the owner was based on the fact that a 12-year-
old jockey had carried several pounds of dead weight in
his jacket. Hence Vic. expression “ top-heavy.”
Donald E. F.” : Many thanks for the pen-picture
P.L. : That’s nothing. Plenty of cab-horses will eat
saveloys—or almost anything else they can get hold of. ..
Quando : The scissors are mightier than the pen. The
Father Hccker article was clean stolen without acknow-
“ TAKE UP THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN.”
A sketch out-lack.
(With the usual apologies.)
ledgement by that Sydney paper from the Catholic
Times and Press (Eng.) of 30th March North Nyma-
gee : Had it been admitted at the start, instead of the
finish, that the N.N. was only a prospect much less would
have been said about it L.A.P.: Easy enough for
every elector’s right to be punched or marked when the
holder voted, so as to prevent him voting again on same
date W.R.C. : Thanks. But Matt. Bateman, the
Pinjarrah Poet, isn’t half so funny as Purtell, who with
the bard Fitzgibbon shares the Vic. poet-laureateship.
The Bateman poetry is perfunctory; the Purtellian and
Fitzgibbonian is fiercely in earnest T.R. : Thanks
L.E.L.: Poetic, but too crude... Dea : Can’t play in
this yard... D.E.D.: One trouble is we can’t print the
picture along with the verses K.K.: Two verses out of
16
The rest is too insecty for publication Nerveless :Oh 1
Non Geebungus : Alas 1 Most free and independent
asses are built that way Splash: Well, we’ll say that
Gordon Coutts has been 14 years in Australia, if you like.
Caro : The “ windy flea ” looked promising till it resolved
itself into “ winds flee.” A.C.W. : After painful con-
sideration, we have had to put a large foot down on the
man with the large smile E.J.P. : The Devil was an
anti-Billite, and The Bulletin isn’t going to boom him.
Blackbird : incomprehensible Nel-
shaby : Shows good work, but hardly up Spero : First
verse knocked us silly—
Resourceful nations plan and take a profit with a pride ;
Huge public reproductive works the northern land be-
stride ;
United South shall handle Science, too, with grip
approved,
To compass works that minor states would cower.
Eric : Persevered to end of your Federation whoop,
but we are now progressing favorably. Curious that
people who can’t even spell always get the “ ode ” and
“anthem” fever worst Abo. : Not taking any more
“ Barcoo’’—unless some doctor likes to write...... Pipe :
“ Uncle Abe ” hasn’t enough in him. “ Old Song ” too
faintly sketched Reg. de C. : Lamentable doggerel.
A.M.C. : Humorous, but inconsequent and jerky
M : Smartly enough written, but not stuffing enough in
it Annie B. : Conventionally pretty J. F. Wat :
No literary quality Turkey : Only a silhouette ; we
want at least a little color in such cases Broome :
Rather clever, but overdone in climax....E.A.L.: When we
came to “ Avaunt!” we promptly did so A.J.L.: Very
decent fooling, but doesn’t suit “ B.” L.A.W. : What’s
to be expected of a bard who rhymes “ odor ” with
“water” and “romancing” with “swinging”?
G.A.G. : Indifferent workmanship F.S.D. : “Copper-
top” hardly carries sail enough Gestor: Ancient
James Deering: After your letter, The Bulletin is really
coming to the opinion that an Irishman can’t stand a
joke at his own expense .... F.B. : Very unlikely, those
name-genesis yarns of yours... D.M.M.: A'anderbilt too
far away A.G.W.: Unsuitable for Bulletin Pat C.:
Poetical zero, anyway Neila : You write verse as if you
were lifting a 2651 b. dumb-bell L.E.S. : Friendly old
wail—it has come in thrice a day for the last 16 years.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
J.P. (M.): Yes, it is indeed belated W.G.N.:
Good idea Bert H. (S.A.): Characteristic sketch, but
too weak for direct reproduction. Will use. . Kas:
Received Bro. : One may serve ..Nemo: Might serve
as painter’s idea—unsuitable for sketch ... Jessie A.M. :
Idea at variance with our politics Flab. P. : Unprint-
able, of course. The Bulletin endeavors to be a not-
indecent paper ; it often even trim 3 its expressions to
anticipate the objections of the filthy-minded ... I'n
available : T.M. (Mt. U.), R. Hart, Dea.

He had a lovely buggy rug
Made out of possum skins
And he often found it useful
While staying at country inns.
When the bedrooms were not extra clean
And if he felt a bug
He threw off all the bedclothes
And rolled himself in his rug.

E. D. Millen, Land;, Mining and Financial
Agent, 14 O’Connell-st., Sydney. Applications
under Advances to Settlers Act prepared and con-
ducted.*
. Wesfcralia, in April, gained 72 people by
excess of immigration over emigration. The Red
Dust Province has been losing population for
seven months, but this sudden turning of the tide
leads the ’Gropers to hope that their ill-luck is
already over.
Arthur Russell, American dentist, 8 Bourke-
street E., Melb., makes beautiful teeth or teeth
beautiful, whichever is necessary. Also painless
operations.*
In two recent cases (one in Switzerland
and one in ’Frisco) the entire human stomach has
been removed with comparatively little inconveni-
ence to the patient —in both instances a woman.
It only remains now to take a man’s brains out
for repair, and return.
Before the advent of the National Cash
Register tradesmen were so affected by the care-
lessness and dishonesty of assistants that they
could never accurately gauge their takings. But
now the National Cash Register has revolutionised
the condition of bakers, butchers, grocers, drug-
gists, tea-merchants, hotel-keepers, cafe-proprie-
tors, restaurant-keepers, and tradesmen in general.
The price of the Register ranges from £5 to .£6B,
and easy monthly payments can be arranged. The
headquarters of the machine in Australia is at
393 Georgo-st., Sydney, where the manager, Mr.
W. A. Lingham, conducts his far-reaching and
successful business.*
WHISKY AND HEALTH.
Whisky of the right sort, such as the “D.C.L. 1
Scotch (Black Bottle), taken in the right way, is
good for body and mind, it preserves health, and
is often an invaluable remedy in disease. Note
“ D.C.L:”*
The text-book in English history (Dr.
Collier’s “Nineteenth Century”) prescribed by
Adelaide University Council for the ,senior
examination in Sept., 1899, contains at Chapter
VII., page 85, this startling piece of information :
The French are engaged at present, with the sanction
of the Egyptian Govt.., in cutting a ship canal through the
Isthmus of Suez, hut it is doubtful how far this can ever
be a complete success, owing to the sand. India can now
be reached from England in about a month at a cost of
£lOO.
John Parkes and Co., of Priory Works,
Warwick, have apologised to Scrubb and Co., of
London—the manufacturers of Scrubb’s Cloudy
Fluid Ammonia —for infringing on their copy-
rights and trade-marks in having prepared and
sold a preparation with a similar name-label and
get-up as that offered by Scrubb and Co.*
Just issued by Geo. Robertson and Co., of
Sydney, a set of 12 very neat and artistic illustrated
post-cards, which, being of regulation size and
weight, are good for transmission upon an affixed Id.
stamp to any place within the Australasian pro-
vinces ; a l|d. stamp being required for further
afield. The designs, which are views of Sydney
and its surrounding beauty-spots, are treated in a
quietly elegant manner, which should make these
cards much favored.
Among recent signs of growing friendship be-
tween Britons and Yanks are the interweaving of “Jack”
and “ star spangled banner” at Tampa, playing of “ God
Save ” in several Yankee theatres on Queen’s Birthday,

steamed out of Manilla Harbor, and the constantly in-

Violinist Remenyi was an indefatigable “curio” col-
lector, and one day his practised eye alighted on a picture
in the shop of a Mrs. Davis, in Hobart; he enquired the
price, and was asked 18s. for it—frame and all. Remenyi
indignantly declined it; but in a fortnight he called
again, and found the lady still obdurate. Eventually, he
*° r Ben k London, and sold it for
“Shifter”: George Musgrove is nephew of demised
operatic liyster. Musgrove, senior, was acting-manager
the ope, like George, who doesn’t act. George just
displayed his ability in engineering an Italian opera co.
through M.L. Before that, he only seemed to be a stall-
lounger.
Beware of the curly-headed man, for he is tricky with-
out a doubt. Take, as Australian specimens of the
moment, juggler Cinquevalli, conjuror Dante, and Jack
M Uowan, the ingenious light-weight boxer. Each of
them has curly hair and an engaging smile. In accord-
ance with the natural fitness of things, boxer Jack’s smile
is the boldest and frankest of the three, whilst Dante’s is
peculiarly feline. The conjuror is the only one who
takes no risks in his performance.
A state of nervous tension is seemingly essential to ab-
solute perfection in Cinquevalli’s performance. On bis
opening Saturday night at Melb. Bijou he made no mis-
take, yet on the Monday and Tuesday he failed in two or
three instances to bring off a “catch” at the first at-
tempt. Success had soothed his nerves. As soon as he
came to Melbourne, the modest stranger was given to
understand that he would find it hard to excel Provo, the
clever balancer of yore. Provo’s skill was vaunted and
magnified until anxious “Cinque” began to doubt his
own reputation, and by the time his first “ turn ” in Aus-
tralia fell due he was strung-up to a high pitch. The re-
sult was an almost incredible accuracy in his work.
Sceptical people almost doubted whether some of the
things he did so cleanly were as wonderful as his subse-
quent oecasional slips showed them to be.
“P.A.”: Louise Hepner, “The Belle of New York,” is
a faint reproduction of what Fanny Liddiard was 10years
ago. Their faces and voices are alike, save that Louise
pipes with a faint, tremulous gurgle which suggests
that she must have practised her scales in early
youth while under water. Girard’s engagement
is probably justified by his loose-jointed, irrespon-
sible, marionette-like movements, funereal appearance,
raucous voice, and cavernous mouth, and he seems to
amuse those who take their pleasures sadly. But it
seems a wilful waste of money to bring a fat man all the
way from America to be the father of the queen of
“ Kamiaic Apera,” when there are heaps of fats here who
could have swapped hats with Girard just as well. Mugg
&nd Blinky Bill could also have been left in America, for
Williamson has two men in his chorus who are more
humorouslv ugly, and who could go on and off just as
brilliantiy
Reported rrom the States that a circus elephant re-
cently killed his ninth man—his keeper, who was drunk
and fooling with his charge. On a N.S.W. station once
there was an Arab entire noted for his good temper, but
one day, when the man in charge of him went drunk into
his box and gave him a brutal thrashing, the horse
attacked and killed the man, and ever after would
promptly “ go for” anybodv smelling of drink who came
near him.

George R. Ashton,, one-time Melb. artist for The Bul-
letin, is now appearing as a “ lightning sketcher” with
Albert Chevalier's show (a sort of German Reed enter-
tainment) at one of the little London halls, where the
audience is severely respectable, and front seats are
78. od. Old friend George takes the stage as Rossi Ash-
ton. His mother was related to the famous Italian
tragedian, hence his second Christian name, which he
always kept in the background until a Melbourne friend
advised him to work it for its full professional worth.
Rossi Ashton goes for a lot more than “George R.,”
especially on a play-bill. Dowagers look at it through
them gold-rim tried pince-nez, and ask, “ Anv relation to

who dropped his title when he took to the stage.
Bernhardt and Damala once had a divorce—the neces-
sary consequence of their once having had a marriage.
An English journalist, who adored the divine Sarah from
afar, rushed away to Hie hotel where she was stopping to
congratulate the “one and only” on the shattering of
, manacles that bound her to a faithless spouse.
Madame was engaged, but she would see her good
triend. He entered the gorgeously-upholstered drawing-
room where Sarah held her artistic court, to find t>h ■ lady
lounging in a big chair, while on the white wolf skin at
her feet sprawled “Jack” Damala, with his picturesque

electric beams of romantic devotion. The “ good friend”
halted and stammered, and conveyed lamely, rather than
said, that “he did not expect, under the circumstances,
you know, to meet, to see” —• “Mon Dieu,” said Sarah,
what a farce! Does the situation not explain itself?
How like you the infect? We are obliged to be affectionate
to each other no longer. The duty has become a luxury ! ”
Concerning “Tanqueray,” writer heard lately, from a
reliable source, a hit of (probably) unwritten stage history
which is worth telling. When Pinero wrote the play it
was refused by every London manager to w nom he sent
h a d written it “on his own,” and not to order,
and had faith in it. So he hired St. James’s Theatre, in
which to have it put on at a matinee, anil engaged his
own co. to play it—choosing G. Alexander for Aubrey
and Mrs. Pat Campbell for Paula. It took, and was
played at other matinees ; and at last, through a break-
down in his other arrangements, Alexander was per-
vaded to put it in the evening bill. The story shows for
the ?th time what risks a masterpiece that is off the con-
ventional lines runs of getting no show. If any other-
living dramatist but Pinero had written it—but, then,
could anyone else have written “ Tanqueray ” ?
After all, it appears, on the authority of composer Sul-
livan, that “ Pinafore” did “ fall rather flat” when first
produced in London, and the management had serious
thoughts of withdrawing it ere it had run 100 nights.
But Sullivan doesn’t endorse J. C. Williamson’s statement
that the performance of the opera was “ broadened ” on
American lines when the librettist found that eight N.Y.
theatres were booming it. The London success came in
due course, without any alteration of the original Gil-
bertian plan. Sullivan attributes the sudden increase in
receipts at the Savoy to two advertising influences. He
was conducting the Promenade Concerts at Covent
Gardens Theatre at that time, and every night he played
the “ Pinafore ” music. Liking the music at the concerts,
the public began to flock to hear the opera. The news
that it had made an enormous hit in New York was a
further ad., so, in its third month, “ Pinafore ” got right
hold of London’s sluggish middle classes. There are
probably 2£ millions of people in the big metropolis who
to this day have never seen a Gilbert and Sullivan opera
or a comedy by Pinero. Their theatrical taste never runs
to anything but blood-and-thunder drama and a panto-
mime once a year.
The last appearanoe on the stage of Edmund Kean was
as Othello, and he could not get through it. He had
become reconciled to his son Charles, by putting away a
feminine iniquity. Charles acted lago. In the third act
Edmund dropped his head on his son’s shoulder and
said, “Charley, I can’t go on—l’m dying.” He was
borne off, and died within two days.
“T.D.”: Have come to regard “East Lynne” as the
dying spasm of the melodrama combination. Whenever
the tearful story is put on the boards I seem to hear the
piteous wail of the heroine for a few shillings to pay her
washing-bill, and the first violin seems to join his big
brother, the ’cello, in an ominous growl of “ No salary,
no music.” It is safe to conclude that, a desperate and
final appeal is being made to womankind, which “ always
goes to ‘ East Lynne ’ for a good cry."

Minister Best, of Victoria, and Trenwith,
M.L.A., having gone to Maoriland to collect new
ideas about laud settlement, the House of 48 Rich
Landlords has seized an early opportunity to in-
form all concerned that it isn’t taking new ideas.
Reid, M.L.C., stated emphatically that if Best
and Trenwith brought back any “ill-considered ”
projects from the socialistic isles of the Moa (all
new or democratic projects are “ ill-considered ”)
the 48 Petrified Ones would “knock the stuffing
out of them.” And yet the 48 Rich Landlords
rush into experimental legislation very gaily at
times. Witness tho Council’s great scheme for
the wholesale introduction of Hindoos and other
niggers, which it cheerfully described as an Alien
Restriction Bill.
The Commercial World (London) writes re-
garding the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society :
“ We always confidently anticipate a good year from this
vigorously-conducted Mutual Society. The circumstance,
therefore, that the figures for 1897 show no falling away
from the steady and substantial progress which is inse-
parably connected with the Society’s past career occasions
us no surprise. As a matter of fact, the Society earns its
success by deserving it, and, that much being conceded,
the best possible has been said for the continuance of the
large measure of public support which it has hitherto
fallen to its fortunate lot to receive.” Pleasant reading.*
The woes of Queensland public-school
assistant-teachers
Dear Bulletin. —Re an apparently prevalent notion that
Queensland assistant school-teachers get good salary, and
have no reason for growling. A few facts. An assistant-
teacher, after passing five exams., with a year’s work
between each, gets only 6s. 6d. per day. After two years
more he In ay get a rise of 4J4d. per day, and after two
years more another 4(4d.; total, 7s. 3d.‘ per dav. He
may get this, but I know of a.-t’s who have waited four,
five, six, and in one case nine, years for the Head-
teachers also send in secret reports upon a.-t’s, which are
doubtless taken into account when the a.t’s promotion
question is being considered. Surely in common fairness
the a.-t. should get a copy' of any such report, so that he
may know how he stands and have a chance to defend
himself. The picking of a.-t’s for a rise, instead of being
done by the Under-Sec., the general inspector, and one
district inspector, according to regulations, is often done
by the general inspector alone. It would be interesting
to know, also, what percentage of a.-t’s got their rise
when it was due during the last six years ? What was
the lowest percentage of marks gained by the classes
taught by those promoted teachers ; and what the highest
percentage among those who were not promoted but
were entitled to be ? And, finally, what lodge ought an
a.-t. to join, in order to get a share when the favors are
being distributed ?—A.T.


Have Proved Themselves to be
THE WOMEN’S BEST FRIEND.
A Newcastle lady’s Case.
FOR THIRTEEN YEARS’ A SUFFERER.
BILE BEANS EFFECT A CURE WHERE DOCTORS AND
ALL OTHER MEDICINES FAILED TO BENEFIT.
Mrs. Jane Colman, of Beaufort - street, Hamilton, Newcastle, had
been a sufferer from internal ailments for 13 years. Her life was
almost despaired of. Doctors failed to cure her. Medicines were of no
benefit until she tried Bile Beans. Here is the gist of the lady s story .
“Mrs. Colman commenced to suffer about 13 years ago, when she was
assailed with severe pains through the head, which were most acute a ie
base of the skull and in the temples. An attack of this kind was invari-
ably followed by retching, so violent in character as to prevent Mrs. to -
man from getting about at all. This continued for some time, and the
sufferer’s system rapidly ran down. She was only able to obtain temporary
relief, although she had three of the best doctors in Newcastle in constant
attendance, and tried no end of patent medicines. At last her sleep
became disturbed, and wakeful nights, through which Mrs. Colman would
toss in nervous agony, became the rule, instead of the exception as hereto-
fore. The lady also suffered from complete loss of appetite, being unable
to take more than a cup of tea now and then for days at a time, ihe small
amount of food that Mrs. Colman did take she found herself unable to
digest. Sharp pains distressed her in the shoulder, back, and kidneys,
and she was totally unable to recognise in the poor frail wreck of a human
being the once robust and healthy woman she had been. She became list-
less and morbid ; her eyes had a dull, heavy, sunken look ; the least exer-
tion prostrated her, and she could not stand for 10 minutes w ithout getting
restless, her feet becoming numb with the feeling of ‘pins and needles.
She was recommended to try Bile Beans, and decided to give them a
trial, and the result was that she was completely cured by this most valu-
able of present-

In conclusion, let us say that Mrs. Colman’s neighbors are all surprised
at her recovery, and those who doubt the genuineness and completeness of
this cure are invited to investigate it fully.

Troubles-
THEY CURE YOU WHILE YOU
Influenza and Colds
Influenza is not generally understood by the greater part of those who
suffer from it. It is in reality an aggravated form of cold, supplemented
by a general weakness of the whole system. Ordinary colds, it is well-
known, are caused by the congestion of the blood, which, as a rule, is most
prominent) in the head or throat. Influenza can be traced to the same
cause, and irregular or insufficient liver acticnis, in most cases, responsible
for both. When the liver, through any derangement of the digestive
organism, ceases to act in the proper manner, a certain amount of bile finds
its way into the blood, and, at the 'same time, the blood created from food
consumed is of a decidedly poor quality. In this manner, the blood becomes
congested, the circulation sluggish, and a cold results. The circulation of
the blood now being much slower than usual, the entire system is affected.
The nervous organism becomes unstrung, the appetite poor, and the rest
disturbed. The body is extremely susceptible to chills, and the slightest
draught causes a violent attack of coughing or sneezing. Many so-called
cures for influenza fail to get at the root of the trouble, and only afford a
temporary relief. A medicine that will keep the liver in thorough and
regular working order, and the digestion right, will, without doubt,
the most effective preventive and cure for influenza and colds. This is
what Bile Beans for Biliousness will do, and we maintain that no better
remedy can be found for these ailments.

CONSTIPATION.
Everyone suffers at some time or other from this most distressing and
rather dangerous ailment. It is an irregular and weak action of the bowels,
and in extreme cases the bowels may not act for weeks. In a case of this
sort the complaint is very dangerous, and a proper remedy should be
applied immediately. Women often suffer more,from it than men, and the
frequent headaches suffered by this sex can nearly always trace their ori-
gin to constipation. It is caused in most cases by carelessness and neglect,
but in some cases it is brought about by a disordered condition of the
liver. It is, nevertheless, a fact that when regularity of habit is practised
constipation is seldom found. The effects of constipation on the system
are many and varied, among the most common of which may be mentioned
pile?, sick headaches, ddbility, sour stomach, humors, and intermittent
fevers. Regularity is the main thing to be observed in cases of constipa-
tion, and, in conjunction with a short course of Bile Beans, will prove
very effective. The early morning, immediately after-breakfast, is the
best time to make a trial, which, if unsuccessful, should nevertheless be
persevered in the next day, and so on until the case is cured.
BILE BEANS are an phidonbted Specific for Biliousness, Sick and
Nervous Headache, Indigestion, Constipation, Piles, Female Weakness,
Pale-faced Girls, Irregularities, Bad Breath, Blotches, Pimples, Dizziness,
all Liver and Kidney Troubles, Dyspepsia, Heart Palpitation, Pain in
Back and Side, Fulness after Eating, Lack of Physical Tone, Heartburn
and that Tired Feeling. Obtainable from all Chemists and Storekeepers,
or from the Australian Depot, 39 Pitt-street, Sydney, post paid on receipt
of Is. ljd. per box. Bile Beans come within the reach of all, and at the
low price they are sold at, no one should be without a box.

In 1847 the British flag covered 3,588,000
tons of shipping manned by over 186,000 British
seamen. Now the same flag covers 10,325,000
tons of shipping—and the British sailors number
only 124,000. In ’47 the Protectionist law re-
quired that four-fifths of the sailors on any
British ship must be Britishers, and therefore the
Old Countree really had tars to defend her shores
in case of need. Now, under Freetrade, the
cheapest tar gets the hard ship-biscuit and the job

pessimists who hold forth about

At Balmain last Friday (according to the
D.l. report) Dr. MacLaurin repeated the old
wa w Cra ? about how Federation must raise the
JN.b.W. Id. town letter postage to 2d. just as
gaily as if it hadn’t been exploded a dozen times
already. There are four provinces (N.S. W.
Queensland, W.A. and Tasmania) with Id. town
postage and only two with 2d. town postage.
I hey will all have a sa,y in settling what the
f ederal postage will be, so the odds are four pro-
vinces to two that the 2d. postage yarn turns out
a lie. And the statement that 2d. postage is cer-
tain is a lie in any case.
Frank Madden, M.L.A., refuses to appear
before the Royal Commission appointed to in-
quire into his own charges against David Syme
of having done a number of shady land transac-
iions at Mt. Macedon. Frank bobs down judi-
siously behind the shelter of his Parliamentary
privilege, and alleges that the Commission—
which consists of Judge Williams—was not
ordered by Parliament in proper form. Which
may be wise, but it doesn’t look any too cour-
ageous. A lion who roars so loudly in the safe
retreat of Parliament shouldn’t wholly mislay his
roar when he is outside.
Kidston’s amendment, demanding that
there should be every-man-one-vote at Q. Federal
Referendum, looks like a tactical blunder. If
Queensland gets into the Commonwealth, the
Federal Constitution establishes one-man-one-vote
at all Federal elections throughout Australia. So
if Queensland can get into the Commonwealth
even by a referendum which is confined to old
Tories with overdrafts at the Q.N.B. it should
get there. The first beginnings of manhood suf-
frage depend on it getting into the Commonwealth
somehow. This isn’t a time to kick the dozing
dog of Toryism into unnatural wakefulness.
Dr. MacLaurin, author of the abortive
attempt to insert the “wait for Queensland”
amendment in the Amended Bill now seeks to
prove that while under the Convention Bill
N.S.W. will pay 225. 6d. per head (according to
his own financing) extra taxation, this will immedi-
ately rise, if Queensland comes in, to 295. 6d. The
doctor did not jump this idea on his party until
he began to see the extreme probability of Queens-
land accepting the Bill. MacLaurin’s theory :
(1) If Queensland doesn’t come in it is impossible
to federate without “our natural ally.” (2) If
Queensland does come in it is impossible to
federate because the adhesion of “our natural
ally ” means so much extra taxation.
That foolish organ of parsondom and Fat,
Brisbane Telegraph, largely owned by the wealthy
Cowlishaw:—
The meeting last night showed that the Convention
Bill is a fat-man’s measure. Will the workers of Queens-
land make a note of it? Do they know that it is intended
to draw a line up North to mark a boundary down to
which colored labor may come, when Federation is here v
Australia was never so full of prophets before.
The Federal Govt, isn’t formed yet. The Federal
Parliament (both Houses to be elected by one-
man-one-vote) doesn’t exist yet. No one knows
who the Government or the Parliament will con-
sist of. The only way the Cowligraph can know
what that unborn Parliament and Government
will do is by goinground to (say) 900,000 possible
electors and asking them if they propose making
a Parliament that will establish a black-labor zone
in Queensland. And, as it hasn’t done that, it is
merely a germ prophesying in a big 400-gallon
tank, and saying that it knows all about the world
outside. Rats!

When S.A. Labor-party first cap-
tured Parliament in ’93 (the Downer
Govt, was then in power) its programme
contained (inter alia) Workshops and
lactones reform, Workmen’s Liens,
-Electoral reform, restriction of candi-
dates expenses, Adult suffrage, estab-
lishment of State export department,
Workmen’s Blocks, State Bank of issue
and deposit, and Legislative Council re-
form. All these are on the Statute Book
except the last two, which now form
prominent items of the Govt, policy.
A. Parliamentary Labor-party
ascribes its success in politics (wrongly,
Ihe Bulletin thinks) to the fact that
none of its members have ever accepted
office in a Ministry. MTherson, the
first leader, who was responsible for the
pledge, refused office in the Kingston
Ministry, and Batchelor, the present leader, could
have had office when Playford became Agent-
General in 1894, had he desired it.
The U.S. has a very heavy protective
tariff and the tariff taxation averages 12s. 6d.
per inhabitant per annum. N.S.W. is allegedly
Freetrade and taxes its people in customs duties
at the rate of about 19s. per inhabitant per
annum. And the Twenty-Two-and-Sixpenny-Lie
people want to persuade N.S.W. that by approxi-
mating to the tariff which costs the U.S. 12s. 6d.
per head it will naturally pay about 41s. 6d. per
head.
The bunch of ex-Ministers of the Crown
who turned up at Gov. Beauchamp’s levee, added
to those absent, proves what an absurdity it
would have been had N.S.W. Parliament passed
the resolution of the late Chief Justice Martin in
re Ministerial emoluments. Martin, then a mem-
ber oi the House, moved that Ministers should
receive =£2500 a year each while in office, and “ a
generous pension ” for life after. The House
wisely rejected both proposals.
Under Westralia’s Act, before a man can
claim a vote he must have been 12 months in the
province and six months constantly
residing in one place. Then, when
he registers his claim, he must per-
sonally attend an electoral court—
wasting a whole day to do so. Then
his name is subjected to a court
of revision three months afterwards,
by which time any interest he might
have taken in the matter is pretty
well exhausted. If he manages to
get his name on the roll for a cer- ~
tain district and finds it necessary
to change his residence, he must
wait another six months before
being qualified to make a
fresh claim ! In the interim
his name is struck off the
roll for his original district,
so that he is disfranchised for
six months, any-
how. Groper-
land is a grand

A FAILURE.
SALVA : “ Dear brother, why don't you give up drink
and get converted? He that seekelh shall find
and his life shall be saved. ”
MR. STONERROKE: “Dunno, mum — hie —been looking
for someon ’ to save me life for the last — hie—
three hours! ”
Dawson, the new leader of the Q. Labor-
Opposition, began his career as chief by a slashing
and well-merited attack on ex-Speaker Cowley.
Although the speech was deemed by some indis-
creet and over-strenuous, it was thoroughly justi-
fied by success—Cowley being relegated to a back
bench and the Speakership falling to his opponent.
Cowley—who is head of the Q. Black-Labor crowd
and a pillar of Boodlewraith—was generally re-
garded as a fixture in the Speakership so long as
the Coalition reigned, and his downfall is indica-
tive of Dickson’s weak hold upon his party.
Sam Smith, Labor M.P. for Pyrmont,
advises N.S.W. Public Service to reject the
Amended Bill because under it they “ would ha ve-
to take their chance of obtaining billets under the
Federal Government with the men in the other
colonies.” The average N.S.W. Labor-member
has such a profound respect for the men who gave
him a billet that he is horrified that the inhabi-
tants of Australia outside his own province should
even be considered when the billets of Australia in
general are going. To him the Cornstalk is a little-
God Almighty, and should be treated as such.
In S. Australia the candidate for Parlia-
ment must cease “ orating ” in public two days-
before election day. But he “gets
there all the same.” If the vote is
to be taken on Saturday, he sends
in his belated election-speech-reporb
on Thursday night; and his friend,
“Pro Bono Publico,” as well as
his enemy, “ Paterfamilias, ’* have
some remarks to make in the open
columns. Not that the S.A. papers
give “ Pro Bono ” much encourage-
ment—at anything short of ordi-
nary ad vt. rates. Also, the number
of “socials ” held on the day be-
fore the election is increasing—
not political gatherings, of course;
but the candidate or a friend of his
happens along, and then somebody
will lead the conversation round that
way.
Federation makes steady head-
way in Westralia despite the frantic
efforts of the old ’Groper party, headed
by editor Hackett. There is really no
newspaper worthy of the name in the
province. The West Ausl’Balian, an
excessively prosy sheet, is ; chiefly the
property of Harper, M.L.A., an early
settler, who secured a splendid block of
agricultural laud within 10 or 12 miles
of Perth, and wants to keep the price
of everything he produces up by shut-
_ ting t’otherside produce out. His moans
in the paper are something harrowing.
The only other Perth daily is practically
owned by Alick Forrest—so nothing more
need be said. A good, lively paper is badly
wanted-in the ’Groper capital, and Fremantle
is without an organ of any kind.
‘ ‘ Malle ” writes
Just heard the latest anti Federal argument from the
man in the street Said'he, “ I’m going against the Bill
because if it passes we’ll have the people of Victoria over
here inside twelve months, seeing what they can pick up.
I know five Victorians here now looking out for factory
sites to snavel if it passes.” And yet when people from
England came to establish a soap industry at Balmain and
snavelled a site how N.S. VV. jubilated. And how they all
talk about the advantages of bringing population and
capital into N.S. \V.— provided the population and capital
is not Australian, and it is some German or other outsider
who comes to snavel a site and furnish employment for
N.S.W.
Premier Dickson already shows signs of
wobbling. He announced that he won’t make the
Federal Enabling Bill a party question ; which
means that every member of Q. Assembly can take
his own course, and the House has a free hand.
And he also announced that if Kidston’s amend-
ment (insisting that every adult should have a
vote at the Federal Referendum) is carried, he will
abandon the Bill forthwith. >So Dickson says, in
effect, that he will abandon the Bill if it is altered,
and he won’t roll up the strength of his party
majority to prevent it being altered.

H“ r L| ,ve rst favorites had successively gone down
at the Williamstown meeting, and Marie Corelli was
carried Vhf Bix , th ?° d last race ‘ Consequently she
earned a big heap of coin—quite three times as much as
the average favorite carries in a race worth only £4O, and
sutheuent to cover the previous losses of punters who
follow the first-favorite “ system.- That’s why Marie
„ h "’ as s " . flagrantly interfered with. Ikev

spoil Corelli s chance, even at the risk of a six months’
aisqualification—hence the desperate character of the
bumping. When the Aas man talks of foul riding (in
these petty races) as a thing that can be stopped by com-
plaints to the authorities, he talks nonsense. Nothing
can stop it except the tote, which would wipe out the
and unscrupulous Ikeys, and leave only the
big books upon the field. The Bulletin is not in
! a '"? r ?. f J eav >ng even Alf. Joseph and his brother bloated
capitalists on the field, but it gives them credit for being
innocent of any disposition to hire foul riding in a race.

, Though Q.T.C. officials are selfishly blind to it
the general public begins to feel the shoe pinch in the
matter of turf-legislation. Q.T.C. does not recognise
either Central or Northern racing associations. There is
also a Southern association, comprising a number of un-
registered clubs which race near Brisbane. Thus evil-
doer- are not deterred from “strong” work on Q T.C.
courses, being sure of a choioe out of several (unregis-
tered) havens of refuge. One clever gent., at a recent
meeting point-blank refused to wait on the committee
.. explain,” &c. “ I’m going to the Towers,” he said ;
let the s do as they like.”
* • * •
What was wrong with Dundonald when he ran
in the Hamilton Handicap, one mile, at Q.T.C. races on
Mayl? He carried 7.12, but was never prominent. On
May 24, with 8.5, he wins Brisbane Cup, two miles, easily.
Backers of form, who saw the brown gelding
Pardon finish in the Royal Stakes, at Randwick, after
leading for five furlongs, and neglected to have a hit on
him for the Flying Handicap on Saturday, don’t deserve
to back winners. On form he couldn’t lose—and he
didn t; for, starting at Btol, he couldn't go slow enough,
and won pulling up. Such good things don’t often go
out at “ eight." Loads of cash went on Dozon for the
race, but she got lost in the crush.
Maluha, a long, spare-looking bay gelding,
helped himself to the Hurdle Raoe, on Saturday, without
anything raising much objection. With Kiora out of the
way it was reckoned an open race, and Maluha, Mist,
Hinau, the pony Ladylike, and ancient Hereward were
all well backed, but nothing had a chance with Maluha,
who jumped to the front and stopped there, winning
from Myrmidon and Ladylike, with the others arriving
after varied intervals. Old Hereward was wrecked after
asho tand rocky passage, whilst Hinau performed well
enougL to show' that he is the makings of areal good cab-
horse.
A promising youngster pulled out for the two-
year-old race at Randwick was Olympus, a huge son of
Corinth and The Oaks. He is a big, clumsy, even-tem-
pered fellow—something like an overgrown foal-and
when galloping spreads himself promiscuously all over
the course ; but in the race he showed plenty pace, and
finished straight and game and well up. Olympus seems
to possess all the attributes of a tojj-notcher, and only
wants teaching how to gallop.
* * * *
At Kensington (Sydney) pony races t’other day,
a nag, which had not won a race for 18 months, got home
unbacked, at which the “books” rejoiced greatly.
Noticing their gladness, the jockey, a diminutive, half-
starved youngster, who had not ridden a winner for a
year or two, passed his cap round amongst them for a
sub. All he got was £1 from a large, simple bushy who
had backed the outsider. The grateful Hebrews gave
him jeers.

Inspector-General Fosbery has instructed the
N.S.W. police to summon pony-racers who mount boy-
jockeys under 14 years of age. The Children's Protection
Act covers this growing evil. The first conviction under
the Act took place at Maclean court the other day, and
although hut, a nominal fine was imposed a healthy scare
has been started.

Pastor Be van has been lecturing in Melbourne
on the tote, a special visit having been paid to Adelaide
for the purpose of studying the machine and its methods.
“The difference between the bookmaker and the totalisa-
tor,” said this wise ecclesiastic, “is that, with the book-
maker, the public may sometimes win, while with the
totalisator they never can.” Well, then, what is Bevan
raving about? He says that he wants to kill gambling
(though his yarn looks much more as if he wanted to pro-
mote the interests of his friend with the deafening clothes
—the bookmaker). And if a gambling-machine, on which
the gambler always loses, won’t discourage gambling,
what will? The pastor says that the tote is such a
machine. Also, a machine on which the public always
loses would kill itself, and doesn’t need to be slaughtered
by any chubby Dr. B. ecclesiastic. If the tote was what
Dr. Bevan says it is, it would have been quite dead long
ago.

“It is 18 years since 9st. won the City and
Suburban,” writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent,
“ and Bend Or carried the load. But Nevvhaven might
have had feathers up, for he galloped in the hot sunshine
like Titan when at his best, and received a merited ova-
tion. Praise all-round is unstinted, for Cooper’s horse
has had no ‘unacclimatised ’ apologies for previous mal-
performances."

The N.S.W. representatives of the Australian
XI. have so far done their share. They hold the highest in-
dividual aggregate : Noble, 258. Also the six top scores
Gregory 124, Noble 116 (not out) and 86, Trumper 82 and
64, Iredale 78. They-secured the only centuries scored ;
the bowling average ; and the record-bowling by Bill
Howell. Only one score each of over 60 has been made
by Victoria and S. Aus.: Trumble 51 and Jones 54—and
they are both bowlers.

Australian cricket-teams always reckon York-

match of the trip. For weeks beforehand the artisans

All the huge wooden stand at Bramall-lane ground. The
«„"r on,nent match probably meant a loss of
£l6OO or ±2OOO for the two remaining- days.

What a grand, consistent bowler Trurable is !
New trundlers bob up and do remarkable things for a
match or two, but Trumble is always the same safe, un-
assuming trier who is ever there at a pinch ; his “off”
days are few and far between. Also, with the bat he can
generally be depended on for 20 or 30, and few batsmen
are better at “stopping a rot."

Some of Bill Howell’s club-mates thought his
great bowling performance worth the cost of a cable, so
they sent across the laconic message “ Well done, Bill ”

S.A. cyclists, who quarrelled with Adelaide
Oval authorities several years ago, have decided to go
back again ; and the Cricket Association, which owns
the ground, intends to spend ±lOOO in making the fastest
track in Australia. The new arrangements have aroused
indignation among cricketers, who will have to stand
down for cyclists on four Saturdays every season.

How Bilmartin does draw them ! Between
8000 and 10,000 enthusiasts were at St. Kilda on Saturday
to see the plugger and Don Walker try conclusions in a
three-distance match. The match itself was a terrible
fiasco. Martin’s pacing machines, advertised as “ master-
pieces of the maker’s art,” went wrong in two events out
of three, while in the middle one Walker’s chain came off
wii Bill finish “on his own.” In the other two events
Walker had it as he liked, and the only semblance to a
race was in the mile sprint, when Bill had to follow his
rival for nearly the whole distance, his pace collapsing
within 100 yards of the start. The fill-up races, to which
nobody but bookies and backers gave the slightest atten-
tention, provided rather better finishes than usual and
rather fewer fakes. The admission money was Is. and
2s 6d., and the St. Kilda Club will score heavily after pay-
ing the ±lOO over to Walker.

The Bulletin’s London correspondent: “ <T. F.
Scholes, the young Canadian, who beat ‘R. Russell, of
N.S. W. for the English amateur featherweight cham-
pionship, is a very capable 20-year-older. Close as the
final contest was, I thought the man won who deserved
to, and for once the referee thought with the man-in-the
crowd. For three years J.F.S. has held the Canuck
feathership, has always had the best of tuition, and an
old man’ very useful indeed with the mittens or
knuckles. But, by-the-by, who is R. Russell ? ”

They are swelling the head of coal-skinned Ike
Stewart, at Golden Gate A.C. (Sydney), by putting before
hnn many bigger dubs than himself. Queen’s birthnight
he faced Patterson, a hunk of flung-together humanity,
billed as the “champion of Parkes” one day and “cham-
pion of Orange” next. Hard to think he was ever cham-
pion of any place where another fairly-healthy specimen
of the human race existed. Every time the black made a
rush or looked wicked, Patterson would cuddle the floor
|J n d t‘ r .v to get underneath it. This little game was in-
dulged in about 18 times during the 6min. the pair were
ui the ring, and then the “champion of Parkes and
Orange ’ was in such a plight through scare and the
exertion of dodging that the referee stopped the farce.
* * * *
The much - heralded Gaffney - Weekes fight
(“winner to meet Jack M'Gowan”) at Alhambra A.C.,
Sydney, Queen’s-birthnight, was a big disappointment.
Gaffney, with a good reputation, failed to live up to it—
showed too much make-believe. He proved himself a
capital actor, but ocular evidence, as far as the 400 or 500
sports were concerned, was dead against him. Twice did
Gaffney go to the boards writhing and grimacing as one
suffering terrible pain, but the crowd jeered and the re-
feree quietly said “Fight on.” In the ninth three-minutes
Gaffney absolutely refused to continue, and the verdict
was given against him. He had the worst of matters
throughout. Weekes, who made his first appearance for
a purse, boxed cleverly—but only boxed. He has too
little bull-pup in his nature fora fighter, and has done far
too much sparring. With Melbourne Jack M’Gowan as
vis-a-vis, either would strike serious trouble very early.
* * ♦ »
Poet and Williams fought nine stiff rounds at
Alhambra A.C. (Sydney) on Saturday night for the bulk
of a ±25 purse. The condition of either could have been
improved, but there was no doubt about the earnestness
°f the engagement. .Williams, white-skinned, sinewy
and lathy ; Poet, brown-pelted, stocky and muscular,
were an interesting contrast. Williams developed a
nasty eye early in the go, and it kept gradually swelling
and closing till a steam-hammer drive in the ninth round
made a clean gash under the damaged optic, and knocked
all the starch out of its gritty owner, whose seconds
straightway gave in amid great applause. As showing
the difference between a man in and out of condition, it
might be mentioned that Williams won Alhambra Club’s
first tournament, meeting, in the final, Jones, who had
previously accounted for Poet. At that time Poet had n’ t
sat in front of a square meal for a week or two before,
and had done little in the way of preparation, but he w r as
in great feather on the latter occasion.
* * * *
Alhambra A.C. (Sydney) excelled itself on Satur-
day night last. Three bouts in first round of 9.7 novice
tourney were all fight from end to end. Maorilander
Cribb, referred to last week as having been tried out,
figured in one bout, and made an awful iness of his man,
more through main strength and stupidity than other-
wise. Amusing to see Cribb, five or six times in ever3'
round, stop to brace up his pants, brush his hair back, or
spit over the right shoulder. He displays wholesale con-
tempt for the enemy; and, judging by appearances,
would do so even were Bob Fitzsimmons in front of him.

Dan O’Connell and Jack Conlon are matched
again, and will “shape up” at Golden Gate A.C., June
24. Each has posted three-fifths of a £25 side-wager.
Dan thinks he’ll come out top next time, and will work
hard with that end in view. There’ll be no dearth of
Conlon money—in fact, fairly good odds may be depended
upon about the Pirate footballer.

Katoomba and Bahamas (Sydney)—crack teams everyone
—strain ljin. rope nightly, preparing for L. Foley’s tug-
of-war championship competition. A.U.S.N. and Police
(Senior-const. Rouse s 10) are strong favorites, but sup-
porters of other combinations readily snap auy shade of
odds going. Some hitch, for which the promoter was not
responsible, precluded the event being brought off at
Fitzgerald Bros.’ circus, as originally intended, A new
locale—probably Agricultural Society’s Ground —will
now have to be chosen.

Bananaland’s 6ft. 4in. ex-pug. giant, Dick
Barker, is a whispered good thing for Foley’s scratch
pulling championship, to be brought off in conjunction
with the tug-of-war event. Dick fairly “lays over”
every one who has tackled him at this game, owing to
the immense leverage provided by his abnormally long
limbs, but A.U.S.N. people (with McSharry) and the
Mortlake gas-stokers have a rod in pickle for the Q. big ’un.
Besides, there’s Keating and about 30 other entrants, all
of whom are in love with their chances. Barker will be
remembered as the man who licked, and left at death’s
door for weeks, Dutchman Harry Placke—6ft. 4in. in his
socks, and the little ’un of the fight.

City Club (Sydney) bowlers have won all present
year’s championships of the province—viz., individual,
rink, and club, and supplied the three placed quartets in
second-named competition. This is an achievement never
equalled before. Same body of trundlers has won
club supremacy three times, and been runner-up three
times, since “ Pennant ” matches were instituted nine or
ten years ago.

Bob Fitzsimmons and Jim Jeffries, the sym-
metrically-built giant Californian boiler-maker, should
have met to contest the world’s pug. supremacy at Coney
Island (New York) on Friday night, but it is odds-on that
Coney Island A.C. was among the “ 200 hotels, saloons,
bathing pavilions, and other buildings,” which cable says
were destroyed by fire on the date fixed for the fight.
That the red-headed Maorilander was “ up against a stiff
argument ” this time all Yankee judges insisted, and the
preponderance of opinion favored the chances of the
vigorous 22-year-old as against those of his bald-pat ed
nval—who, by the way, is now just on 40. But pre-
judice often warps Uncle Sam’s judgment, and until
the J'lmaru blacksmith is actually knocked off his
high pedestal, we of Australia will have none
other for our money. Jeffries’ ascent has been
rapid indeed. Of 12 battles fought, not one defeat is re-
corded against him. He beat- Sailor Sharkey, among
others, and in no single instance can the charge of "lick-
ing dubs for a record ”be laid at Jeffries’ door. It was
expected that the American would scale almost 15st.,
while the Australian would be at least 3st. lighter. Quite
a fortune will come to the winner, as he gets the whole
purse (20,000dols.). The fight is to be veriscoped, and the
fighters are to receive 663 per cent, of any revenue de-
rived through this source, which, considering that the
royalties accruing from the Fitzsimmons-Corbett battle
pictures totalled 25,000d015., is a big consideration. If
Coney Island A.O. has supplied portion of the fuel for the
big fire, Lenox A.C. will probably bring the battle off ;
the result may be known ere this is read.

B. R. Wise, Q.C., delivered on Friday
last an address on the “ Oxford Union ” to the
members of the N.S.W. Literary and Debating
Societies. Lord Beauchamp (who like Mr. Wise,
is an ex-president of the Union named) was in the
chair, and prefaced the speech of the evening with
a few remarks and, in response to the usual vote of
thanks, trotted out a few off-hand observations.
The daily papers next morning printed the Earl’s
speeches in extenso, and dismissed Mr. Wise’s
carefully - thought - out and instructive address
with a jumbled-up paragraph. In fact, the
occasion which started with the gifted speaker as
central figure, became one of mere Governor-
worship. Very probably no one despises this sort
of thing more than the Governor himself.

supplement of eight pages. Post free to

“Melb.”: Mayor M‘Eacharn’s telegram
to Mr. Chamberlain on the “overflowing” meet-
ing at our Town Hall about the Transvaal, was
very disingenuous—a paltry quibble. The meet-
ing first assembled in a small room upstairs, but
overflowed from there to the Town Hall proper,
being 400 persons, according to the morning paper
reporters, while the Hall holds 4000. Overflow-
ing ! Nor was the meeting unanimous. Having
been there, I will assert it is possible that 100 did
not really concur with the resolutions passed. I
want someone to explain why the War-office
would not produce papers demanded by Labou-
chere, and disprove the assertion of its having
been cognisant of the intended Rising before-
hand.
Roderic Quinn’s book of verses, “ The
Hidden Tide ” (Is. 9d. post free from Bulletin
office) has received uncommonly good critical
notices everywhere, and has evidently nestled
close to the hearts of Australian poetry-lovers.
By the way, what is probably Quinn’s finest story
—“Margaret”—-will appear in next Bulletin
Xmas number.
The N.S.W. Disunion party imported
lawyer Higgins from Victoria to preach thedoctrine
that the Federal Constitution should be alterable
to any extent by a mere majority vote. In other
words, that Queensland, Victoria and S.A. should
be able to vote that N.S.W. be cut up among
them, or that its public lands be thrown into a
common fund, or any small thing like that. Fancy
Higgins goinginto a life-partnership with two other
lawyers, the proviso being that the other two,
being a majority, could alter the deed of partner-
ship anyhow they pleased, even to the extent of
taking all Higgins’s share of the profits ! And
Higgins and the N.S.W. Disunion party say that
they believe in this principle, and want N.S.W.
to reject any Federation in which it isn’t in-
cluded !
John Norton apologises to Gov. Beau-
champ for his former remarks upon the “ Birth-
stain ” incident, and, amusingly enough, now
seeks to saddle upon Premier Reid the whole
blame of the sending of the Governor’s historic
message to the people of N.S.W. In doing
this, the genial John refers to the Premier as
“the unprincipled political panderer who now
disgraces and degrades a high and honorable posi-
tion ; ” “ this penniless political pirate and putrid
perjured politician ; ” “ this wobbly, wriggling,
writhing, worthless waster;” “this perfidious
Premier and perjured political trickster.” Which,
leaving out the perjury and the putridity, may be
mostly true ; but it is very tiresome. Alliteration
is all very well if you “take it in your stride,”
as a clever hurdler does a fence; but it is evidently
going to be the death of John Norton.
Federation—yes or no. Has Germany to
have Samoa with Mataafa as king—or shall we
Federate with America ? Malietoa Tanu would
be happy if he knew a shipment of “ Zetz ” Spa
Water has been specially ordered for the fleet—
who all say “ Zetz ” is the correct water to mix
with any stimulant, or drink by itself. “Zetz”
kills uric acid, aids digestion, and is nature’s
true regulator. The password for good health is
“Zetz.” Plump for “Zets.”*
“The Telegraph’s” Broader View.
The following is an interesting extract from an
article published in Sydney Telegraph, and
written by Sydney Telegraph’s financial editor,
and proudly reprinted (at the Telegraph office)
in pamphlet form under the title of “ Federal
Finance, by R. L. Nash.” (He is now spelling his
name with a large G). This was in the days be-
fore the King-street paper discovered that the
capital was not going to be in Sydney, and that it
would have to spend £5OOO a year on getting its
Federal Parliamentary news wired from the metro-
polis. Consequently it was also before it began to
discover that Federation meant the hopeless ruin
of N.S. Wales, and that the federated goat would
browse in George-street, Sydney, and the united
Australian cow moo on the steps of the General
Post Office: —
State finance has been made the basis of this enquiry ;
but it is only a narrow view of Federation There is the
broader view—the welfare of the people. The removal of
all customs duties on interprovincial trade, the enlarge-
ment of markets, even here, in New South Wales,
from 1,300,000 to 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 of con-
sumers, means an amount of internal development
we can hardly foresee. It is idle to fear, as Mr.
Heydon appears to do, that we of New South Wales shall
be the helpless prey of the colonies by which on three
sides we are surrounded. On the contrary, it will in
time throw a great manufacturing industry into this
colony. Newcastle will develop into a second Middles-
brough, and Ulawarra into a second Lanark, and
we shall be able to hold our own quite as successfully
as we do now. There are many other changes which
Federation will develop. The hangers-on to Ministries,
those whose business it is to prey upon the provincial
revenues, will find their occupation far less remunera-
tive when government is established on a wider and
more national basis. We believe, too, that the “protec-
tionist” in the southern colonies will in time become less
and less a “ prohibitionist,” as the area of internal com-
petition widens, and prices find an Australian level.—
“Federal Finance,’’ page 21.
“ C.” writes on a matter of finance :
Dear Bulletin.—After much reading of the Sabbath
Shellback's figures showing that N.S. W. can’t possihly
manufacture anything for itself (being too far gone in
drink, perhaps) so must necessarily import everything,
and having heard, on the Shellback’s own authority,
that there will be a tariff of 7} or 126 per cent, under
Federation, and that the “ price of a gun ” or a marble
statue or a 1000-guinea painting will therefore be some-
thing awful, I have been induced to look into the matter
personally. The following examples are in the very best
Sabbath-paper style:
Example No. 6.
We have now obtained the following awful example
from the head of a stupendous distributing firm.
Take, first, a lib. tin of baking-powder—
Cost in London 0 0 6
Charges (freight, &e.) 0 16
Duty, 25 per cent, on 2s. 6d 0 9 3
£0 11 3
Cost in warehouse Warehouseman’s
profit (say 29 2-19 per cent.) 0 7 9f
Charge to retailer 0 5 4J
Retailer’s profit (27 2-11 per cent.) ... 0 12 10
Cost under the Bill £l7 3}
Equals 1401 1-15 per cent, above London invoice.
Example No. 7. —Cost of a Blanket.
Picture to yourself a blanket (all pure bull’s wool).
Cost in London 0 16
Charges (freight, &c.) 0 4 6
Duty, 625 per cent, on 3s. 2d 0 9 7}
Cost in warehouse £1 6 10}
Varous other robbers’ profits 2 10 3}
Cost of Bill’s blanket £3 18 1}
Example No B.—Price of a Billy.
Now let us imagine a billy under this infamous Bill.
Cost in London 0 0 5)
Charges (freight, &e.) Oil
Duty 25 p.c. on 2s. 7}d. 0 1 10}
Cost in warehouse 0 15 6}
Warehouseman’s profit, say 67 2-9 per
cent 0 62 11}
Cost to retailer £4 7 9}
Retailer’s profit, say 101 3-2 per cent. £l2 5 2}
Cost of Bill’s billy £l6 11 1}
Equals 11301 7-3 per cent, above London invoice.
I hope these dreadful examples will move your readers to
reject a measure which will have such disastrous effects
on the Fiji-banana trade, and cause the ’bus-horse to fall
down twice as often in George-street as he does now—to
say nothing of the inevitable increase in the price charged
to go in and see the bear at the circus.
The “ honorary bench” lives on notoriety,
and weeps if its name is not reported in the news-
papers. Recently a Melb. suburban J.P., think-
ing that he would not be “mentioned,” as another
had signed the register before him, threatened
“to trow the other on the flure ” for two pins.
This in front of a squad of drunks, who danced
with joy at the prospect of a mill.
A medical man to The Bulletin, on a
matter urgently needing reform :
Being, on a recent Sunday, summoned to attend a
woman in childbirth in a poor Sydney locality, I found the
unfortunate creature actually perishing for lack of nourish-
ment; and, as stimulant was imperatively and immedi-
ately necessary, I despatched the husband for brandy, but
was astounded, in the interim, to learn from a policeman
that my written order, -as a-doctor (and a J.P. to boot)
would not protect from Sunday - trading prosecution
any publican thus supplying liquor—no matter uhat
the emergency! It was, unfortunately, in this case,
too late to save the unfortunate woman’s life ; but I
am further informed that the “ proper course,” in cases of
such extreme destitution, is to “communicate with the
Govt, medical officer.” What a ghastly mockery where
death from actual starvation is as imminent as in
this case! What is urgently wanted, and what
neither Govt, nor the charitable societies provide, is some
means of provisionally providing instant relief. Time
enough, after the life has been saved, to make formal in-
quiry into the circumstances of the case.

queer coincidence: —
About the time of the celebrated Dandenong gale I was
loading a schooner with cedar logs, about 16 miles north of
Cape Byron, on the north coast of N.S.W. Had to send
the logs out by means of ropes, made fast from shore to
vessel (what is called “surfing-off ”), and once three logs,
that had been secured astern overnight, broke adrift, and
were nowhere to be seen in the morning. Logs thus
breaking away would mostly come ashore, sometimes
miles along the beach, but these didn’t thus turn up.
Nearly a year later, however, a schooner ran ashore in a
fog on the 90-mile beach (Vic.), and her mate, who hap-
pened to have been mate of the vessel that lost the logs,
was astonished to come across these very logs (branded),
just as when he had put the chains round them himself
so long before. From where they had gone adrift to
where they landed on the Victorian beach is upwards
of 1000 miles.
“ David G.” ventilates a real public grievance :
Dear Bulletin.— N.S.W. military authorities are getting
a bit mixed. Two lieutenants are wanted for the Per-
manent Artillery, and commissions are to be allotted by
competitive examination. “ Candidates to be nominated
by the Governor, and applications to be sent to chief
staff officer, with particulars of age, parentage, educa-
tion,” &e. Preference given to those who have served in
the local forces as officers.” Why shouldn’t the competi-
tion be open to those already serving otherwise than as
officers? Same old game of making these billets the
special perks of a particular social clique. Of course it
will be this way :—The C.S.O. will weed out all applicants
whose “parentage” isn’t of the best Botany Bay aristo-
cracy; then the Governor will nominate the most guv-
mentousy of the residue, and the “ competitive exam."
will be a howling farce. Even in the toniest days of the
British army it was just possible for men to rise from
the ranks, and now the matter has been reduced to a
system ; but here they never can do so. There’s no ex-
clusiveness like that of a shoddy aristocracy that hasn't a
great-grandfather to a thousand of it.
Curious circumstance that the Sydney
anti-Federal crowd, which discourses so bitterly
about the Victorian influence alleged to be behind
the “lawyers’ Bill” of the Federal Convention,
should be the first to import Victorian lawyer
Higgins to help the parochial cause. But Hig-
gins was rather a restraint than an assistance. At
the other anti-Federal meetings Dibbs and co.
blithered at large about the unprincipled machina-
tions of Victoria, but in the presence of their
friend Higgins they had to allude to the Vic-
torians as honored brethren, and they nearly burst
with the strain of this unaccustomed politeness.
Also Higgins was embarrassing in another way.
In Victoria he was “agin’ the Bill” on the
ground that N.S.W. had the best end of the
bargain, and when Higgins was imported to
N.S.W. to say the exact opposite of all that he
used to swear to in Victoria—well, it required a
much more agile jumper than Higgins to get
round the owner in time.


Do you want
Consumption ?
We are sure you do not. Nobody wants
it. But it comes to many thousands every
year. It comes to those who have had
coughs and colds until the throat is raw, and
the lining membrane of the lungs is in-
flamed. Stop your cough when it first ap-
pears, and you remove the great danger of
future trouble.
AYER’S
Cherry Pectoral
stops coughs of all kinds. It does so because
it is a soothing and healing remedy of great
power. This makes it the greatest preven-
tive to consumption. It is not a question of
many bottles and large doses. A few drops
will often make a complete cure. Don’t neg-
lect your cough: you cannot afford to run the
risk. Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral will soothe your
raw throat and quiet your inflamed lungs.
Beware of cheap imitations. See that the name
Ayer s Cherry Pectoral, is blown in the glass of
each bottle. Put up in large and small bottles.

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

A picture from life :
The man leaned right into the railway-carriage. There
was positive anguish in his drawn face. The lady inside
was very pretty and beautifully dressed ; her softness of
complexion and hair, of lace and filmy material,
“ ph u ed lr ; the searching glare of the electric light,
which showed the rich luxury of every detail of her cos-
tume. She smiled with a pretty, regretful tenderness as
she replied lightly to his earnest words. He looked at
lf , he °° uld " e , ver look long enough, as if her face
held for him the whole meaning of life. As the train be-
gan to move, his fingers fell passionately on the ungloved
hand resting on the window ledge, then instinctively he
sprang back, raised his hat, and I caught in full light a
ghmpseoflns vvhite face. Directly the train steamed out
ot the station the lady rose, carefully rolled up her veil
and, quite indifferent to my presence, proceeded before
the mirror in the carriage to dust, her face with a dainty
pocket-handkerchief, and to apply to forehead and nose
the minutest layer of powder with a tiny puff. She
patted and arranged her curls, drawing them with a
hairpin into coquettish position and curve, and then
lowering her veil, she sank into the seat with a sigh of
satisfaction.—Ex.

Frederick Sargood (of the “rag” trade) all credit

Mr. 0. J. A. NIELSEN,
A Living Witness oi the virtues of the
Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12,1898.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALB’ALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.
Sciatica Cured.
Parliament House, Sydney.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l can truthfully assert that since using your
Eucalyptus Oil and Aifaline Rheumatic Pills I have ex-
perienced an immunity from my attack of sciatic. I have
recommended the Aifaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—Having suffered for some time from a com-
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, and their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the benefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, ~ (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

half the quantity twice a day.

Two of a Trade.
That two of a trade seldom agree is a common
saying. Its weakness, however, resides in the fact
that it is a cavilling, sneering saying. The idea
sought to be conveyed is that the disagreement is
the outcome of reciprocal jealousy. While that is
likely, it is not a necessary, or even a philosophical,
inference. Two of a trade may easily see reasons
for an honest difference of opinion to which the
outsider is blind. Again, two of a trade may agree
and both be wrong—on a point, of course, con-
nected with their own industry. Some years ago
there was high debate over the question whether a
painting, exhibited in Paris, was an original
Velasquez or a copy. Half the artists and
connoisseurs in Europe got hot under the collar
about it. It was one or the other—so they said.
Later on the fact came out. It was neither an
original nor a copy; it was a replica. The experts
were mistaken. And so runs speculative judg nentt
in everything.
Here is the case of two doctors ; both, doubtless,
competent men. If they were wrong, or if only
one was wrong—but let us have the story first.
It comes from a reputable source, and is well
corroborated.
“In March, 1891,” says the relater, “I had a
severe attack of influenza, which prostrated me
for two months. After this I could not get up my
strength. My appetite was poor, and what little
I did eat gave me much pain at the chest and
around the heart. Sharp, cutting pains in the re-
gion of the heart seized me every now and again,
sometimes so bad I feared I was going to die. At
night I got little or no sleep on account of wind,
which rose into my throat until I fairly gasped
for breath. During-the painful attacks of my
complaint perspiration would stand in beads upon
my face.
“I soon lost strength to that extent I could not
stand. Indeed, I was weak as a child. I was
often so dizzy I had to catch hold, of something to
keep me from falling.. Several times these attacks
have come : upon me at concerts, obliging my friends
to conduct me home. As time passed on I grew
more and more feeble, and abandoned all hope of
ever being well and strong again.
“ I had two doctors attending me who prescribed
medicines; which, however, eased me only for a
time and then I was as bad as ever.
“ One doctor said I had pleurisy; the other said
I had heart disease.
“For two and one-half years I lingered along,
nearly as much dead as alive, all my relatives and
friends thinking I would not recover. In Novem-
ber, 1893, a book was left at my house in which I
read of a case like mine having been cured by
Mother Seigel’s Syrup. My wife procured me a
bottle from the Provincial Drug Stores in West-
gate-street, and the first bottle gave me so much
relief that I continued with the medicine. I could
then eat well, and the food agreed with me, the
pain around the heart soon ceasing.
“In a short time my strength returned, and I
got back to my work well and vigorous. Since
then I have been in the best of health.. You are at
liberty to publish this statement and refer to me.”
—(Signed) William Henry Jervis, 48 Rendlesham
Road, All Saints, Ipswich, November 13th, 1897.
One of Mr. Jervis’s doctors pronounced his com-
plaint to be pleurisy; the other said it was heart
disease. Were they both right, or both wrong?
Or was one right and the other wrong? In the
latter case—which one ? Judging from the symp-
toms as set forth by Mr. Jervis the probability is
that both were right— as far as they went.
The sac or bag which surrounds the heart (called
the pericardium), and the sac in which the lungs
rest (called the pleurae), are parts of the lymphatio
system ; which is the especial abiding place and
stamping ground of the kind of poison, produced
by the diseased digestive system, and the cause of
rheumatism, gout, pleurisy, and heart disease.
Now, after (if not before) his attack of influenza
Mr. Jervis suffered from acute dyspepsia with
torpid liver, which engendered the poison that set
up a mild form of both pleurisy and heart dis-
order. When the real and underlying ailment of
all —the dyspepsia —was cured by Mother Seigel’s
Syrup these supplementary or consequential
troubles vanished, as might be expected.
So we see that—strange as it may seem—two of
a trade can differ and both be right.*

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing' cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. lIEARNE. —Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and 59

When the Liver Goes Wrong
the Whole System Suffers.
A Bad Case. A Good Cure,
{From tht ««. Australian Christian World”
July Ist, 1898.)
(by our own reporter.)
11 Out of pure gratitude for my deliverance
from a most serious and painful complica.-
tion of complaints, I am willing to
give you the whole afternoon if you wish
it!” answered Mrs. Cole, of 2 Purves-strect,
Forest Lodge, Sydney, to our reporter
on his requesting an interview as to
that lady’s case. “ The whole trouble,”
said Mrs. Cole, in answer to further ques-
tions on the subject, “arose, I firmly believe,
from the poison that got into my system
through a deranged liver. Scon after that
organ got out of order and started to work
irregularly my appetite began to get very
fickle and changeable. Without cause or
reason I turned against delicacies which
were formerly favourite dishes of mine, and
sometimes I sat down to meal after meal
and rose again without being able to so
much as swallow a single mouthful. In the
morning I invariably had a most unpleasant
acrid taste in the mouth, together with a
dirty coated tongue, and, as time wore on
(for I must tell you I was seriously ill for
over a year), my liver trouble got worse and
worse. When I woke in the morning I
felt giddy, stupid, and dazed, and often
made vain efforts to get out of bed, being
forced to lie back again on the pillow to
collect enough strength before finally suc-
ceeding. At nights I was unable to sleep,
and I should lie wide awake restlessly
turning about and counting the weary hours
as they wore away, till the dawn began to
break, when I usually fell into a sort of
stupor,—it was not a proper sleep,—and I
woke from that half dazed as I have
just described. I became very, very thin,
not like I am now (Mrs. Cole has "now a
particularly healthy appearance, with a
clear eye and that clear freshness of
complexion which is never seen with a
disordered liver), and, as for my complexion
■ —well, sallow was not the word for it. It
was as yellow as if I was suffering from
yellow jaundice.”
“All this must have had a very depressing
effect upon your spirits ?”
“ It did indeed, as anyone might expect,”
answered Mrs. Cole, “ though you have not
heard the half of my bad symptoms yet. I
was most low spirited and dull and
crotchety as well. I couldn't bear the
slightest noise, and the smallest trifles
would have a most distressing effect upon
my nerves. Nothing could interest me. -I
didn’t care even to hear the news of the
day, and the trifling cares of domestic life
drove me into a state of nervous irritation.
I was always languid and weary. I went to
bed every night as fatigued as though I had
done some excessive labour, when as a
matter of fact I had done nothing; but I
could not sleep, and I rose in the morning
feeling more tired, weary, and lifeless than
I did the night before. I suffered from
terrible headaches, and I vomited almost
daily. More than once, after I had managed
to walk a short distance to my mother’s
house, I have had to fling myßelf upon the
grass, one of these sick fits attacking me and
causing me to vomit terribly, and being so
giddy that I positively couldn’t stand. Then
palpitation of the heart often came on
suddenly, and I know of nothing more dis-
tressing and terrifying whilst the violence
of the fit- was on than that.”
“ You suffered from other complications ?”
“Yes, I regret to say, after a time pain-
ful neuralgia attacked me. The attacks
came on at short and regular intervals. I
should first feel a peculiar tickling sensa-
tion in my face and jaws and then a sudden
and awful whirling sensation over all my
face and head, just like the mad rushing of
a big red hot wheel in my head. Ido not
think there are words in the dictionary
capable of expressing the exquisite agony I
suffered whilst these periodical attacks
asted. Many doctors attended me, but
mfortunately for me they were not able to
tither give me relief or effect a cure,
Although I faithfully followed the treat-
ment they recommended and took the
medicines they prescribed. Then my
rheumatism ”
“ What! Mrs. Cole, you surprise me, did
you suffer from rheumatism also
“I did, very acutely, too. The pain in
my legs was terrible. My feet swelled up
to a prodigious size, and of course it was
impossible to put on a shoe, and worse
than all my knees swelled. I was quite
unable to walk. The pain in my ankles,
my knees, and other joints was unremitting,
and gave me no rest neither by night nor by
day.”
“In what way was Clements Tonic
brought to your notice ?”
“ Through a little book that was placed
in my hand when things seemed at their
worst. I supposed I had reached the worst.
No medicines that I took did me any good,
nor were the many doctors who attended
me able to alleviate my sufferings. Well,
as I said, someone gave me a book that con-
tained an account of a case that in many
important particulars was precisely similar
to mine. I naturally read it with engross-
ing interest, and, seeing that Clements
Tonic had effected a complete cure for that
, patient, and being satisfied as to the
absolute truth of every word of the account
of the patient’s illness and cure by Clements
Tonic, I commenced to use that remedy
myself. Very glad I am, too, that I did.”
“In what way did it act in your case?”
“The first thing I noticed, the very
first action of the remedy, was to make
me sleep, and about that there could be no
mistake. Natural sleep came upon me after
taking the remedy as regularly as the night
follows the day, and from the time I started
Clements Tonic my sleep became refreshing
and dreamless. After long weary months
of nearly sleepless nights, only snatches of
sleep being obtained at odd times when the
pain troubled me least, I can hardly express
to you the priceless boon this sleep was to
me. The neuralgic pains in my jaws and
head gradually gave way to Clements Tonic,
and at the same time the swelling in my
knees and ankles became more reduced every
day till it went away altogether, and I was
once more enabled to get my shoes on and
to put my feet to the ground without pain.
I was able to eat again without feeling at
all sick afterwards, as I used to, and I have
had no sick fits since. Clements Tonic also
rid me of that low, depressed feeling, and
when I now awoke in the morning I felt
bright and cheerful and once mors fit to
undertake my domestic duties, no longer
with a feeling of weariness, but with posi-
tive pleasure. One by one all the compli-
cations which beset me were driven out of
my system by Clements Tonic. My head-
aches were a thing of the past and I was
troubled no more with palpitation of the
heart. My friends all noticed the change
for the better in my health and spirits.
Clements Tonic, in addition to removing the
poison that collects in the blood in conse-
quence of a diseased state of the liver, has
a marvellous effect in toning up the system,
and my natural healthy colour speedily
returned and I commenced to get stout.
It was not very long before I was completely
cured and as well, if not better, than I was
before my illness.”
“You will consent for the proprietor of
Clements Tonic to publish all this?”
“ Yes. You can make what use you like
of what I’ve told you, and I shall only be
too happy to answer any enquiries, if any
should be made, in regard to my recovery.”

Slobach's “Brother."
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“It is impossible, sir ! impossible entirely!’’
and the little Portuguese whirled his cigar roun
at arm’s-length to symbolise the completeness o
the impossibility. •„ tv
The Stranger was a long, grey man, with misty,
far-off eyes and a curious woodenness of movement.
Like a lever-moved machine he slowly now drew
forth a pocket-book, of tattered coat but comfort-
able circumference, and slowly also mow' o
tongue in lifeless, inexorable accents. There i
nothing impossible ! How much ?
The little man swelled and swore. His outward
seeming-pitched, with his high black hat, upon
the topmost note of civilisation—sank suddenly,
with his cotton drawers, to a ludicrously lower
key ; and touched the savage level with his lack of
shirt and shoes. Nevertheless, Senhor Dom Diego
Dozen-other-things Da Braga was what he called
himself, and in the ruined church upon the hill
his fathers slumbered under slabs that ante-dated,
by six-score of years, the Dutch occupation—as,
by twice that time, the British. But the Stranger,
grimly contemptuous of such vaporings, stood
like a tower of silence until this blue-blooded
yellow man—climbing slowly down from his
genealogical tree —was fain to ask in turn How
much?”
“ Twenty dollars.”
It was a good deal for so small a thing—the
mere opening of a garden-gate, and Da Biaga
but not till he had pocketed the dollars—grew
squeamish. “He could not think of countenan-
cing any evil deed ! If the honorable sir meant
any ”
“ I am his brother ! ’’—and the “honorablesir”
laughed curiously within his ribs to think how
neatly this filament of truth enclosed a lie.
“Ah !—so ! ” and Da Braga grasped promptly
at the sop to his conscience. “There had been
variance, doubtless, and the illustrious gentleman
was anxious to repair the breach ? It was a holy
work, therefore—and one on which the Seventeen
Saints would smile ! ” The little man drew the
long one across to where they could see the tower
that rose —emblem of the practical present—
amidst the legend-laden ruins on the hill.
“ When the lighthouse-lamp shines out this
evening, be you at one side of the gate —I will be
at the other ! ”
* * * *
The punctual equatorial night—that marks, the
whole year round, one place upon the dial —had
spread above the lazy ancient town a mellow haze
that dimmed the radiance of the tropic stars, and
lent also a touch of crimson to the lofty eye that
flashed away to seaward its warning of the shoal
Malaccan waters.
The Stranger—trusting less in the Seventeen
Saints than in the Twenty Dollars—waited by a
massive wall—attested as Dutch work by the
Lady and the Ship above the low-browed door.
Which door, being opened with a gentle key, was
locked again as softly when the Stranger had
stepped inside. Beside him, in the dimness, stood
the-Portuguese, and pointed. The other, saying
something in a foreign tongue, passed on beneath
the fruit trees towards a solitary light that broke
the blaokness of a dismal mass of building.
Old Dutch, too, this building was—gabled and
turreted and balconied into an antiquated prim-
ness that made violent contrast with the hot-
house languor of the air—the faint, sweet smells of
mangosteen and jambu and custard-apple, the
palms that swept the skies, the fireflies flitting
through the fragrant darkness. But the Stranger
saw only a window and a man. A window that
opened to the ground, and a man who sat smok-
ing in the midst of books. Not an old man, nor
an ugly, but stamped—upon a florid visage, meant
for careless ease —with the seal of a dim, unslum-
bering terror. A terror now no longer dim ; for
the Stranger, entering softly, stood before him,
hatless and bowing.
The other—minding him of an executioner he
had once seen bowing to his place a guillotine-
subject—felt as if a frozen hand had grasped his
heart, but he never moved a muscle. It is only on
the stage or in the beaten-track novel that men
start under great shocks. Moustache-obliterated,
too, his mouth showed nothing, nor did the hand
tremble with which he laid presently his book
upon the table. And thus, for a full minute-
while the Stranger, within the window, stood and
gazed, and Da Braga, without it, crouched and
listened—the Devil, resting from the work of his
hands, saw that it was good.
Said the Stranger at last, in Italian, “ I have
come !—brother ! ”
“ Fratellol” The Portuguese—understanding,
by analogy with his own language, that one word
—discharged therewith his mangy little conscience
of all responsibility. “The honor of the Da
Bragas was preserved ! ” he told himself, and re-
tired to his own part of the establishment.
The seated man got slowly to his feet, and thrice
his lips opened before a sound would come. Till
now there had been a shadowy doubt, dispelled
for ever by that ghastly claim of fraternity.
“ Caffarelli ?” he said. “Are you—do you come
—from — them?" And the Stranger bowed his
head. , ,
The other came nearer. Is there no chance l
he whispered. “ Money, Caffarelli!—money ! I
have plenty ! ” ...
“ Fool ! ” was all Caffarelli said, but in his re-
lentless eye appeared a thousand “ No’s ! ”
The florid man—not florid now—upset a chair
with the sudden violence of his motion. “ Man ! ”
he said—“ you forget! We are in British terri-
tory ! —this is a land of justice !”
“ Every land,” answered Caffarelli, calmly, “ is
a land of justice—the justice of the Brotherhood
upon such a traitor as Herman Slobaeh ! ”
Slobaeh collapsed again into his chair, and fum-
bled under his coat. “ I could easily have shot
you first! ” he muttered.
The other also sat him down. “ True ! he
said. “No need to tell me why you didn’t—and
won’t!”
Slobaeh groaned. “My sons! They are alive,
then?” ,
“ Precisely !—your sons ! Also—your daugh-
ter ! ”
The German sighed the sigh of a hopelessly cor-
nered man. “Would they kill my daughter,
t 0“ Twenty daughters !—if you had them ! And
your worthless self, as well, in the long run. Bah !
why waste words ?—when you know as well as
I do that no sentence of the Brotherhood was ever
left unfulfilled ! ”
Slobaeh lifted up a face like the face of a corpse,
but into the leaden eye there came the semblance
of a sparkle. “Do your bloody errand !” he said,
but insult me no further! ”
It is not possible ,’’ the Italian answered
gravely, to insult a traitor and a perjurer ! M
Slobaeh s head fell on his breast—then jerked
up with a sudden flash of recollection: “ How got
you in? That little yellow reptile, of course!
Was it for money ? ”
Caffarelli shook with horrible internal laughter.
lor twenty dollars !—and because I am your
brother ! ”
The doomed “Aggiurato” jumped to his feet
and snatched a parang from the wall. “Deal
with me as you will,” he snarled, “but, by the
God we have both- forsworn, I’ll deal first with
him. ”
“ Permit me,” and Caffarelli took a cigar from
a box on the table. “As you please,” he added
when he had lighted it. “I am in no hurry.
But I should have thought you, of all men, would
have had some fellow-feeling for a traitor.”
But the sneer was lost in the other man’s hoarse
shout “ Diego, Diego—here ! ”
The azure-blooded servitor came, like Agag,
“delicately,” and Agag’s fate, too, would
assuredly have been Diego’s, but for the prodigious
spring with which the monkey-like little man
jumped over a parang-sweep that would otherwise
have pretty well cut him in two. Then streamed
upon the night air names of saints and angels by
the score, as out into the garden rushed the last of
the Da Bragas with that desperate parang behind
him.
The moon was up by now, and by her increasing
light the iron-hearted executioner smoked, and
watched the chase, and cared not how it should
end. But, suddenly—with a hollow thump and
the sound of breaking wood—the fugitive dis-
appeared, and next moment the pursuer, rushing
blindly in his wake, vanished also utterly and in-
stantly away.
A well-like opening, circled with a low brick
edging—some shattered fragments of wood lay
around it. Caffarelli fingered these. “ Rotten ! ”
he said. “ Been boarded-over for years, and for-
gotten. He loosened a brick, held it over the
blackness, and let go. “ Four seconds, or so. By
the law of falling bodies that should mean about
250 feet. Falling bodies /—Cospetto ! that’s not
bad 1 ” and, laughing a laugh that should have
made the other Devil envious, the Instrument of
the Brotherhood went to search for the key of the
gate.
In a couple of minutes he came out with it —
took another survey of the hole—let himself out —
and strolled away down the moonlit road, whist-
ling—light-hearted innocent that he was—the
brindisi from “ Traviata.”
* * »
In a dubious Parisian cafe—the Cent Mille Escar-
gots —the “ Hundred Thousand Snails ” —said one
man to another.
“ Read this, Caffarelli ! You were out there
once —for them 1 ” he added in a whisper.
The long, saturnine greybeard took the paper
and read how, in a sleepy old Malaysian town,
some sacrilegious and impertinent Englishmen—
seeking to trace to the ruined monastery a sub-
terranean thoroughfare for bygone monkish rakes
had found two human skeletons beneath the
mouth of what looked like a vertical air-shaft.
Which shaft was found to open in the garden of
the old Dutch house from which, some years
before, an eccentric German had mysteriously dis-
appeared—he and his Portuguese servant.
Caffarelli—reminiscently whistling the air from
“Traviata ’’—handed back the paper, and lookedat
nothing in particular, until the other, who had
keenly watched his face, leaned over and hoarsely
whispered—
“ Slobaeh was the ‘ eccentric German ! ’ One of
those skeletons was his, wasn’t it ? ”
The Italian looked at him with half-closed eyes.
“As you know so much, my friend, you may as
well know that, too —especially as there are no ear-
witnesses. Yes ; I presume the shaft in question
was the one the estimable Slobaeh was unlucky
enough to tumble into ! ” He took up his eau-
sucrie, and put it down again as the other got up
and stood in front of him.
“Tumble into? Liar! Do you know my
name?”
Caffarelli, lighting a cigarette, shrugged his
shoulders indifferently. “Well,” he answered,
“ you say it’s Werder ! ”
“It is not Werder! ” —the man put his hand
into his breast-pocket. “It is Slobaeh ! ”
There was a crash of glasses and a rush of men,
but Slobaeh the younger had been too quick, and
Caffarelli, to the profound disgust of his spirit—if
he had one !—figured in the evening papers as a
“ Respectable Citizen Assassinated by an Anar-
chist ! ”
ALEX. MONTGOMERY
Monte Carlo, Europe’s leading gambling
hell, made a profit of .£1,004,000 for the year end-
ing 31st March last. The Monte Carlo gaming
tables not only pay Prince Albert of Monaco 1
.£50,000 a year for the concession, but supply
nearly 4150,000 for government and public works.
Further, they have to pay out £9OOO in grants to
the bishop, clergy, convents, &c., ; and <£6ooo in
charities. .£34,000 goes to “agents” and the
European press for publicity—or, in other words,
for suppression of the truth regarding the greatest)
gambling shambles of modern times.
A young and verdant reporter in W.A.
struck against something more sudden than usual
in Mt. Malcolm district, and thus records it
in the cold print of a Perth daily :
One peculiar feature about the place is that waves of
insobriety pass over the town at intervals, and nearly
every man is a victim. One resident told the writer that
these waves were most peculiar things, and that scarcely
anyone seemed to be able to withstand them. They were
like a willy-willy, but no one knew how they arose, or
where they came from, and they disappeared as rapidly
as they came, and left merely devastated marks behind'
them, and no one who got in the way escaped injury.
As showing how things go in Mongrelia.
From Thursday Island to The Bulletin :
At Harne Island (three miles from Thursday I.) several
whites are cutting “ mongrel ” wood on equal terms with
aboriginals for a Malay Govt, contractor. His white em-
ployes wade to work daily through a fever-stricken
swamp, cut the trees in Bfc. lengths amidst persecuting
swarms of sandflies, and when about 20 cords have accu-
mulated, a whole month is occupied in punting the wood
out of the morass and beaching it. And for this 10s. per
cord—barely enough to pay for the daily damper, rice,
and treacle. A white Thursday Island tradesman gets
all his hands direct from Japan on a written agreement
for three years at £6 each. One of these, having
“chucked” the job, got two months “under the vag.,”
after doing which he was given the option of resuming
duty or being run in again. Then said he to the boss :
“ You no tlubble, me lun meeself in to-night.” And he
did, rather than return to his nigger-driving boss. Bar-
ring the strong firms of Burns, Philp and Co. and Brown,
Campbell and Co., the white tradesmen here have mugh
ado to keep going against the competition of Jap., Chow,
Hindoo, and Malay, fortified by their own country-
men’s cheap labor, and living upon next to nothing. The
alien has nearly all business in his hands, even the Govt,
roeat-and-bread contractors being Chinese.

A Ditty of Dead Dog (Federal
Whitmanese).
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
A chant of the big-browed Provincial; a song of
the burly patriots of Hole-and-Corner; a wail
from the mole-eyed denizens of Dead Dog !
Lo ! We are watching this fraud of a Federal
movement; we have fixed a bleary optic on
the monkey-manoeuvres of its meddling man-
nikins ;
We understand their aspirations; we know the
deadly designs they cherish against the free-
dom of Dead Dog—the eternal liberties of
Hole-and-Corner!
Listen a moment—Camerados !
What is Dead Dog—if Freedom die ?
A star that fell last night and died in a sewer; a
prowling pup that howls for a vanished bone ;
a bubble of the beer that passed and perished
in the night-time.
* * * *
Scores and scores are the towns in Austral land
that joy in the name of Hole-and-Corner;
Scores and scores are the counties broad to which
Dead Dog is a chosen name.
Keen as hawks and ’cute as crows they watch
each other’s crafty game,
Cognisant ever of the black perfidy possible to
dwellers in some other Dead Dog,
Wotting only too well the guile that lurks in the
bosoms of some other Hole-and-Corner;
Lo ! how they bare the cunning scheme, expose
the deep-laid plot, unveil the treach’rous wile
Proving beyond a doubt that States could only
unite for the accursed purpose
Of taxing themselves* to death, robbing each other’s
pockets, cutting their own throats,
And, above all, for the purpose of blighting the
destinies of Dead Dog, and casting a cross-
eyed curse on the fair prospects of Hole-and-
Corner !
* * * «
Listen again, Camerados ! Of all Dead Dogs in
this fair land
There is but one real Dead Dog— one genuine Hole-
and-Corner,
And they, the other towns that bear our rightful
name,
Would fain unite, with fell intent, to tax our land,
steal off our hearse and sanitary-van, drink
down our foaming beer, embrace our Sunday
girls yea, haply kiss (in maudlin mood) our
mothers-in-law !
Wherefore we call upon you to cease from twining,
vine-like round the verandah-posts of the
casual pub.,
Fortify yourselves again with the immortal hop-
beer of Hole-and-Corner,
And cry “ To arms, to arms ! ”
* * * *
This is no babbling lay that wells from the heart
of a bard that is beeriful,
It springs spontaneous all from the, bounding
bosom of a patriot soul that lives and dies for
Hole-and-Corner.
It calls upon you, ye da,wdling denizens of Dead
Dog, to join you with the dawdling denizens
of other Dead Dogs,
To prevent, if possible, the nefarious designs of
other Dead Dogs;
To stand shoulder to shoulder (and so prevent
others standing shoulder to shoulder) —
In a word, “ To unite to prevent others uniting ! ”
P. LUFTIG.
To Solve the Mystery.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tiie room was full of smoke and the air was thick
with the odour of filthy jokes in which the
woman who fell” figured largely to her own
disadvantage._ Mason, well-to-do broker and
general financier, sat back in his chair and wiped
his mouth with the corner of a silk handkerchief
that always protruded aggressively from his top-
pocket. Then he turned fiercely on a blatant
small-skulled, prematurely-old young fellow who
was exhibitingsymptoms of a yarn that threatened
greater foulness than the last:
“Shut up, Tommy ! It’s up to me.”
And this was Mason’s story.
I was school-teaching once in a God-forsaken
township on the fringe of the Never-Never, and a
I ? l ne j.V } had of it. Taught 20 to 30 different-
sized kids of varying capacity for five hours a day
and the next most exciting thing was to go to bed
and sleep away the interval. No life in the place !
ihe mortgages on the selections around would
have crushed a bogey engine. The people mostly
slouched along between heaven and earth as if
they didn’t give a rap whether they ever saw the
next sunrise. I m not sure that they ever noticed
it, though Heaven knows they were up early
enough (3 and 4 o clock in the morning) slaving
for the banks and the shadow of a decent living.
I took to going to Band of Hope meetings,
they were the oasis in that great desert of
monotony. I used to amuse myself listening to
the tuneless attempts of the local amateur, and
the cold-watery recitations of the youthful pro-
digies. At the conclusion, the red-headed secre-
tary would rise and invite all and sundry to come
to the front and swear off the accursed drink for
ever.
Not that anybody had enough money to get
drunk on, or enough energy to become properly
drunk even if he had the money ; but the neces-
sity for holding these meetings had entered deep
into the souls of all within miles of the little
schoolhouse—partly because of the monotony, and
mainly because of their possibilities as matri-
monial agencies. So the red-headed secretary felt
called upon to do something—to gesticulate and
splutter—and he did it.
I was contemplating the hon. sec.—-his facial
expression, his gestures, his exhortation, and cal-
culating the probable amount of horse-power he
was wasting, when I felt a light touch on my arm,
and a sweet voice close beside said, “Excuse me,
but the grease is dropping on your coat.”
True enough, I was standing under one of the
sconces that held the candles.
Thank you,” I said solemnly, taking a passing
glance at her face. It wasn’t exactly pretty, but
it agreed with the voice.
She stood, glancing up now and again, as if she
wished to speak and couldn’t find sufficient ex-
cuse—and I couldn’t relieve her. At last she
decided to leap the barrier.
“You’re the new teacher, ain’t you? I ain’t
had the pleasure of an introduction, but Cis told
me you were ! Oh, let me scrape that grease off.
Have you a knife?”
I handed her my pocket-knife, and she scraped
and chatted. She also told me her nanie was
Oliver. “Sophie,” she added, and she had
seven sisters, hence the necessity fora distinction.
I told her mine, and the red-headed secretary dis-
missed us all with the Benediction.

wordless embrace, and the Mystery came back

whispered, hoarsely. ® * A .

Then she kissed me hurriedly and ran awav I
walked back and considered those seven sriters
and the awful store of wisdom they must have
4n their lo ng e. xp e rie nce, and wondered
whether Sophie had been inoculated. But I was
really sorry for my question, and she had gone a
foot nearer to the height of my heart-queen of
long youth-dreams. I determined on the time-
test, and vowed several vows to stay away from
the Olivers for at least one calendar month, and
once more felt the glorious sensation of martyrdom.
Friday night week I was sitting in the school-
quarters, when a knock at the door shook me out
of my reverie. I called out, “Come in !” The
handle turned and in walked—Sophie—a dignified
restraint written all over her. I offered a chair,
and sat at a respectful distance. I talked of the
weather, the crops, anything that came handy—-
anything but what I knew instinctively was
uppermost in both our minds.
She suddenly put her hands to her face and
burst out crying. I put out the light, felt for her
in the dark, and tremblingly seated her on my
knee, consoling her all I knew. How we clung
together ! My God, and what nonsense we mur-
mured to one another; and then the passionate
restiveness that disturbed us, half-sitting, half*
lymg in the darkness.
There was a knock at the door. I pushed
into the bedroom, and opened cautiously.
1 Sittin’ in the dark ? ”
You could have knocked me down with a feather
when I recognised the voice as that of old Oliver.
1 said something about just going to bed, and he
went on—
“ I'm lookin’ out for Sophie. She went up for
the mail just after tea, and the old woman got un-
easy about her. So I thought I’d stroll across
and meet her. We’ll sit out on the verandah, if
you don’t mind, and I’ll see her as she goes past.”
I let him do all the talking. I did all the hard,
heavy thinking a man might be expected to do in
the time.
Now and again he would rise and peer up the
road anxiously and say—
‘ She couldn’t have passed me, do you think ? ”
•i u would launch out on the necessity of a
girl having protection when out at night, and got
rid of much general wisdom concerning their
proper bringing-up, ending with a eulogy of his
own particular method, and pointing to Susan,
Anna, Emma, Mary, and the rest of them as
awful examples of girls that never went astray.
I never let ’em out alone with any young fellow
at night time,’’ he said ; then reflectively, “ There
am t a young fellow within 20 miles of us that I’d
trust except yourself. You’re a good lad—a good
lad.
needle, and I was glad when I saw him preparing
to go.
«(^ 6 ? ee F e , d U P fc h o r °ad and then said decidedly,
Good-night, my boy ! I must have missed her.”
1 watched him lounging off in the darkness, and
then went inside.
~ Sophie lay on my bunk sobbing. The shock
that broke in on our opportunity, and the awk-
wardness of her present position, had rendered
the poor girl nearly hysterical, and as I held her
in my arms and tried to soothe her, I knew that I
was in some dim way responsible ; and her cling-
arms were very sweet, and the face on my
shoulder grew restful, and the desire to solve the
mystery of womanhood came back on me with
a terrible force, checked only by the old man’s
implicit faith in my honor. So then and there I
asked her to be my wife, and the delight that
encompasseth lovers was round us all that night,
lhe next day the Registrar quietly married us !
