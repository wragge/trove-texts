THE BEGGAR WHO CHOSE.
Your mind is like an April dawn,
As clear, and clean, and cool, and sweet,
And all your lines are thoroughbred
From forehead smooth to narrow feet.
Dear lady of the high-poised head
And laughing eyes that veil their pride,
My life would be a perfect thing
If one like you were by my side.
.But since I have not much to give,
And since to beg I am—unfit,
Our lives will never touch, and you
Will never know I thought of it.
And token you can't afford such things
It's useless to regret them —
None hut the hrave deserve the fair;
None but the rich men get them!

Illusions About War
Since the fall of Napoleon, Britain has
not been seriously afraid of armed invasion.
For a hundred years she has been undis-
puted mistress of the seas, with a navy equal
to the combined fleets of any two other
powers. To-day the position is different. The
German navy, which began only a few years
ago, has grown rapidly, and keeps on grow-
ing. Soon it will be equal in size to the
navy of Britain. The British statesman
and the man in the street regard this new
fleet with apprehension. All the signs and
tokens seem to indicate that it can have only
one objective—an attack on Britain. Du
Maurier’s play, Blatchford’s pamphlet, and
a large part of the press have shocked the
British into a state of alarm. Peace advo-
cates and fierce opponents of military esti-
mates have been converted. In three years
a Liberal Government nas increased
the enormous naval vote by more than
£12,000,000.
Into that country on the verge of panic
at the end of 1909 there dropped a booklet
called Europe s Optical Illusion, by Norman
Angell. The author’s name (now stated to
be Ralph Norman Angell Lane, of the Paris
Daily Mail) was unknown to the public
Yet no publication of recent years has had
such an important effect in so short a time.
Norman Angell wrote about war, and par-
ticularly about the consequences of a wax
between Britain and Germany. Many strong
words have been uttered against war;
many writers have stripped off the romantic
tinsel and shown war in all its naked hor-
ror; but, as Oscar Wilde said in one of his
essays, “so long as war is regarded as
wicked, it will have its fascinations—when
it is looked upon as vulgar it will cease to
be popular.” Could anything be more vulgar
to the Britisher than a business that doesn’t
pay? War, according to Norman Angell,
does not pay the conqueror, and his forcible
argument has convinced many who sit in
high places, and even the militant Attorney-
General of Australia.
The remarkable pamphlet has been ex-
panded somewhat, and is now published as
a book —The Great Illusion —and sold for
2s. 6d. net. It has been translated into
various languages, favorably received by
most newspapers, and an enthusiast has
given a large sum to increase its circulation.
It is a book which everyone should read. It
is an argument that every sane man would
wish to find true.
The ordinary peace advocates, like most
idealists, set up a moral law against the
natural law, and offer a counsel of perfec-
tion. Angell brushes them aside, for they,
with the belligerents, assume that war is
profitable to the conqueror. He finds the
same assumption implicit in all the maxims
of modern statecraft. He claims that this
is “a gross and desperately dangerous mis-
conception, partaking at times of the nature
of an optical illusion, at times of the nature
of a superstition.” In brief, his case is
that: —
No nation can destroy or greatly damage
the trade of another, since trade depends
upon the existence of natural wealth and
a population capable of working it.... An
invader could only destroy trade by destroy-
mg the population (which is impossible),
and if he could destroy the population he
would destroy his own market (which would
be commercially suicidal).
If an invasion by Germany did involve
\ the collapse, of the British Empire, German
capital w r ould also disappear in large part
and 'German credit also collapse—because
ot the delicate interdependence of credit-
built finance and industry.
For allied reasons, the exaction of tribute
from a conquered people has now become
an economic impossibility, the exaction of a
large indemnity of doubtful benefit to the
nation receiving it, the capture of the carry-
ing trade of another nation impossible, and
the conquest of the British colonies would
be ot no advantage to the conqueror.
Angell brings evidence to show that in re-
cent wmrs. the winner is really the loser,
b ranee is in a better financial position than
Germany; the Japs are poorer, not richer,
for their war; since the defeat or Spam by
America, Spanish securities have doubled
in value; and, since England added the
goldfields of the world” to her “possessions,”
British consols have dropped 20 points.
The colonies, such as Australia, are not
“possessions” of material advantage to the
nominal owner; they must be left alone, as
G. P. Lucas said, “whether they are rigl
or wrong—still more perhaps when they ar
wrong.” If Germany took over Britain
position and continued the same policy, sh
would not be commercially better off tha
she is now.
All this, however, would not dispose
the justification for war or prove that Ger
many would not gain in ways which wouli
compensate for material loss if she con
quered Britain. Angel! therefore attack
the psychological case for war. He show
that human nature is not unchanging, but i
steadily changing in those characteristic
which made man a fighting animal; h
brings to bear* proof that the warlike na
tions do not inherit the earth, and that th
struggle for survival is not of man wit!
man, but of mankind with the universe. In
this struggle, man is moving away from th
resort to physical force, and tending more
and more to eo-operation; thereby extending
the international community of interes
which, in the case of the financial world
had been advanced at the beginning of the
book as upsetting all old ideas about the
practical advantages of war.
The second part of Angell’s book is closely
reasoned, and carries conviction. His case
however, depends upon the first part—upon
the statement that the financial interests of
the great nations are so closely interwoven
that war is as damaging to the winner as
to the loser. It is undoubtedly true that
the growth of international investments has
brought about a condition in which a finan-
cial crisis in one country is felt in another;
and a severe blow to British credit would
spell disaster to many people in France,
Germany, America, and other places. Yet one
can imagine that the destruction of the Chan-
nel' fleet and the occupation of London
would secure all that the Germans might
desire without shattering British credit and
reacting dangerously on Germany. The cash
indemnity received by Germany from France
may have, in the long run, injured German
trade; but the individuals through whose
sticky fingers the boodle passed would have
no objection to indemnities. Nor would the
sons, cousins and nephews who received
official positions in the captured provinces
complain about the spoils of war.
All that Angell has said in a late chapter
to prove that a State is not a person, but a
collection of individuals, seems to have been
overlooked by him in the earlier chapters.
AH the people, or the nation as an entity,
might not gain by conquest; but some of the
people would. Most wars have been brought
about by a few of the people even when the
nation as a whole has been “fanned into
an hysteria,” as Masefield put it. Many be-
sides the standing armies have a vested in-
terest in war—the makers of guns, ships and
ammunition, the contractors, speculators and
adventurers—a host in themselves. Whether
the nation win or lose, they generally stand
to gain.
But even if a war between Germany and
Britain be unprofitable, Angell’s argument
does not apply to war between a great na-
tion and a small one, to the annexation of
Bosnia by Austria or to a fight for a pro-
vince like India. In disposing of the sup-
position that a foreign nation would gain by
the acquisition of Britain’s colonies, he ig-
nored India, which is not in the same politi-
cal position as Australia or Canada. That
brightest jewel of Britain’s crown” has
yielded an enormous tribute to some Brit-
ishers, who do not seem to have violently
objected to it; her 200 millions of people
afford a market for British produce, and
support an army of British civil servants.
Any power capturing India and occupying
the same place, as Britain, would be pre-
pared to receive these advantages, and
chance the consequences..
Coming to the position of Australia in
relation to such a power as Japan, Angell’s
Great Illusion gives us no hope of security.
It is quite conceivable that it would pay
Japan to annex Australia, or part of it. Our
territory would be of use to her surplus pop-
ulation ; our wealth, developed and latent
would be serviceable to many of the Japs’
and, if we had to pay an indemnity, it could
be used to relieve the Japs from oppressive
taxation without dislocating their trade.
In fact, Angell’s generalisation will not
stand much strain. It is one of those things
Sfcrlf/n; good *° be true ' Nevertheless
1 he Great Illusion is a very valuable book
and by tar the most notable contribution of
lecent years to the anti-war propaganda.
It clears away many of the mists which have
gathered around the subject of war, and em-
phasises the movement of humanity away
from the physical-force argument. Angell
does not advocate disarmament. There is
no roya! road to peace; the shortest cut
is that which makes for greater enlighten-
cTumrTiuf the ®" e
county will come to co-operate with like-
mmbrdh People . m other countries. War
might become impossible by a plan also ad
yanced by Maurice Hewlett some“imeL c k'

Some Minor Verse
'The Humbler Pods, a collection of ver
extracted from periodicals and obsci
books, mostly American, was published i
years ago by McClurg and Go., of Chicaj
It filled a gap, and 11 editions have be<
printed since then. The same publish?.:
now issue a continuation — The Humbl
Poets — Second Series. It is not edited
the same hand as the first; its scope is wic
and its quality more uneven. The edito
reached over to Britain and grabbed bits o:
Tennyson, Davidson, Masefield, A. E. Hoi
man, Dowson, Owen Seaman and others,
mix with specimens of humble poetry re
cued from the Milwaukee Morning Glo
and similar places. They also raked ov
Australia, and captured Lawson’s “The Sli
rails and the Spur,” G. G. MeCrae’s “Eorb
Sutherland,” Mary Colborne-Veel’s “Satu
day Night,” and verses by F. Tyrrell Gi
W. F. Chambers.... and Sarah Welch!
was an eccentric rake that caught Sara
Welch in Sladen’s garden, and* missed
many other —well, brighter blossoms. Bu
ev n if it were any honor to be represented
with Phineas K. Buggins, Tennyson anc
other humbler poets, Australia does not ge
any credit, as the editors have not given the
authors a place label. However, it is
higgledy-piggledy with some good tiling
which might otherwise have wasted all thei
sweetness on the desert air of the back num
bers.
There is a rough arrangement of the con
tents according to subject matter. Mase
field’s “Cargoes” is included in a sectio
headed “In Lighter Vein,” with many thing
worse thkn this neat epitaph by R. K. Mun
kittrick :r
Beneath this quiet, turfy
And flower-scented green
Lies Arabella Murphy ;
As usual—kerosene.
In another compartment you find this perfec
little thing by Ernest Dowson (Eng.), who
is, perhaps, not so well known as he ough
to be: —
They are not long—the weeping and the
laughter,
Love, and desire and hate:
I think they have no portion in us after
We pass the gate.
They are not long, the days of wine anc
roses:
Out of a misty dream
Our path emerges for a while, then closes
Within a dream.
Margaret Veley’s “Japanese Fan,” which
originally appeared in Cornhill Magazine
1876, is attributed to “Anon.” Saintsbury
in his History of Prosody, was enthusiastic
over this trifle, and pointed out the difference
in modulation between it and Browning’s
“Love Among the Ruins,” owing to the
shortening of the odd lines. It is worth
reprinting:—
Though to talk too much of Heaven
Is not well,
Though agreeable people never
Mention Hell;
Yet the woman who betrayed me,
Whom I kissed,
In that bygone summer, taught me
Both exist.
I was ardent, she was always
Wisely cool;
So my lady played the iraitor—
-1 the fool.
Oh ! your pardon! but remember,
If you please.
I’m translating; this is only
Japanese.
Some other verses are lifted for this page.

Shakespeare Bibliography
As a catalogue to a library so is a biblio
graphy to the literature of any large subject
And “Shakespeare” is so large a subjec
that the various editions of the Works and
the books of criticism, commentary, exposi
tion and what not, make a library in them
selves —a scattered library, and therefore one
most in need of a catalogue. This has been
supplied by William Jaggard of the Shak-
speare Press at Stratford-on-Avon, a de-
scendant of the Elizabethan author and
printer also named William Jaggard, who
was one of the printers and perhaps the edi-
tor of the First Folio Edition of Shake-
speare’s plays. ,
Jaggard’s Shakespeare Bibliography is not
the first of its kind, but it can be confidently
said that it is the most complete. It is a fat
quarto volume of 730 pages, and it cbntains
over 36,000 entries and references. It has
taken 22 years to compile, and is worth it,
for it is a complete guide to informatiori re-
lating to Shakespeare, and therefore indis-
pensable to every library and to any stu-
dent making an elaborate study of the sub-
ject.
Australia is represented in the list by the
names of Prof. MacCallum, Henry Gullett,
J. Le Gay Brereton, and P. Glynn. Josiah
Symon’s pamphlet and some others have
been missed. However careful, the biblio-
grapher is sure to miss some items, and Wm.
Jaggard proposes to issue supplementary
lists from time to time.
One does not expect to find any of the
compiler’s personality peeping out between
the dry bones of a bibliography ; but it is
evident from the notes to some entries that
Jaggard has his knife into that bumptious
writer, Sidney Lee. He refers to “the im-
pertinent patronage of Shakespeare by ‘Sid-
ney Lee,’ ” and indexes the latter’s books
under his real name—Solomon Lazarus Levi.
The chief cause of offence seems to be:
“ ‘Sidney Lee’s’ unmerited attacks upon
Wm. Jaggard, Shakespeare’s accredited pub-
lisher,” who has been dead 300 years. There
aie not many of the tribe of Barabbas who
are likely to find a remote descendant of the
same name keen and able to defend their re-
putation.
V/Sf 1 1 agree with “Ah” (Bulletin
-..»/&/ll) _ as to the need for an up-to-date
s j a ng aietionaxy. The Jews have just con-
2, *<«, a sene ? of ceremonies connected with
the Shevous, or feast of weeks. It seems
to have been mostly music : and now I want
to know if shivoo” originated thus. We

When morning weaves
A spell o’er his soul, I went
Through £( green place of leaves.
The trees were as olden friends—
AS tall friends of old.
1 knew them, root, trunk and branch,
To their domes lit with gold.
The birds of that forest-place,
Uplifting loud joy,
1 knew theni, song, plume and flight,
From of old, as a boy.

A Presence a'fcode,
Making strange as a world afef
The old ways that I strode.

Telepathy.
How dark it was last night! One bar
Of light swept upward from the Head,
Hung, and wheeled down and round, and fled.
Insistent, steady, low, afar,
The full tide pleaded to the moon
To show her face. All down the long
Dark coast I heard the mournful song
The slow, upheaving breakers croon:
Like one who sots himself to sleep,
And dreams his love has come again,
And stretching out his arms in pain
Awakes—to see the grey dawn creep
With stealthy feet across the floor ;
And knows his utter wretchedness,
And can but kiss her empty dress,
The handkerchief that last she bore,
Half wondering in his misery
That death should be so long delayed. . . .
1 leant above the balustrade
Of the verandah suddenly,
And all my heart and soul and nv'nd
Went throbbing out across the dark,
Flashed like the telegraphic spark,
In aim your own heart’s heart to find.
Was it in vain? One instant’s fire
I seemed to feel your thought with mine.
Who knows? Does the veiled moon divine
The sea’s vague, infinite desire ?

The Ferry Maiden.
We see her on the ferry-boat,
That daily brings us down
From suburbs tranquil and remote
Into the toilsome town.
Across her eyes soft shadow s float;
The laces of her gown
Slip sweetly sideways at her throat,
Sun-kissed and smooth and brown.
She dreams of duel and of dance,
Sword-flash and fan’s gay flirt;
She sees a cavalier of France
Clean through his ruffled shirt
Receive, from some fair lady’s glance,
A sweet and deadly hurt;
And in these visions of romance
The hero’s name is Bert.
We envy her the golden days
Wherein these songs are sung;
We know of tricks that Cupid plays
When dainty maids are young;
How, all across Life’s glittering ways,
His wanton net is flung,
And little birds, where girlhood strays,
Sing love on every tongue.
A youth approaches at a trot;
His face is fat and white;
His socks are plentiful and hot,
A most amazing sight.
But her young welcome falters not,
He is her own true wight;
In accents clear she hails him: “Wot
Cher goin’ t’ do t’-night?”

“Yes,” Mr. Wade said; “I have seen the various articles, and I think they fairly accurately represent what has been, and is, going on. But I have not
been consulted, or even approached. Naturally, as lam leader of the Opposition, one would expect that I should have heard something in an official manner
with regard to such important subjects, and I suppose I am entitled to draw the inference, from the fact that I have not been made a confidant, that there is
something unusual in the wind. But lam not one to submit to the process of being squeezed out by the action of members of Parliament without an appeal ta
the public at large.” -Syd ey DAILY TELEGRAPH.

How to Address Letters.
CorrespoT.dents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves ) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE BOOM THAT IS GOING TO WASTE.
Australia is booming. Federation and a
long series of good seasons have combined to
give the lie to pessimists from Cape York to
the Leemvin, and to hopelessly discredit De-
cayed Fish purveyors from the Bight to the
Gulf of Carpentaria. The squatter, who,
eight years ago, had the gloom of the heavily-
mortgaged inscribed all over him, is to-day in
a position, if he feels like it, to spurn his
bank manager like the dirt beneath his feet.
The overdraft is a nightmare of the past.
The pastoralist’s main business worries are
connected with the problem of what to do
with his accumulations. Farmers, even
improvident and unskilful farmers, have
made their piles in every State. Their goon
fortune has reacted in the usual way on ihe
rest of the community. Country stores and
shops, pubs and stock and station agencies,
stand on velvet. The country doctor, lind-
ing that more and more people are able to
pay his fees, has moved into a larger and
more ornate dwelling; the way-back solici-
tor’s heaped-up Costs are met without a
curse: bagmen, book agents and other pests
get rid of their wares with the minimum ot
argument; writters are being driven by lack
of employment into more savory callings,
for everyone has cash, and feels sure there
is plenty more where it came from.
In the cities the prevailing affluence is
even more marked. People own thousand-
guinea motor-cars who, a few years ago,
scarcely dared to run a cab-account at a
livery stable. The hotels and restaurants
are crowded, and such patrons as refrain
from drinking the alleged champagne that is
supplied there, do so for reasons of hygiene
alone. The business done by theatrical
shows of every grade has not been surpassed
in the history of the stage. Bookmakers are
more numerous, fat, and satisfied with life
than ever they were; chorus-ladies and bar-
maids are lovelier and more bejewelled. A
land tax has lately been imposed which hits
the very rich to the tune of w T ell over a mil-
lion sterling per annum. Of course there
have been moans of protest; but the uproar
was a perfunctory, unconvincing affair at
best. The fact is, Australia’s rich men are
so very rich that the so-called confiscatory
tax of the Fisher Government means no-
thing to them. It is impossible to keep up a
convincing display of grief concerning the
loss of twopence, when one’s pockets are
bursting with ten-pound notes. A cry that
has done sterling Anti-Labor service since
the beginning of things—the crusted howl
that unless the status quo is maintained, and
progress is held up indefinitely, Capital will
be driven out of the country—has completely
lost its sting. Actually the spectacle is of-
fered of the thoughtful business-man speed-
ing the parting idol of other days with
cheers of relief. As a Sydney Share-Market
Circular put it the other week :
If it be true, as alleged, that money is being with-
drawn from Australia, it is a matter of great satis-
faction. There have been times when this country
required all the money that could be obtained from
any source whatever, but that is not the case now.
Never before was there such an abundance of capital.
But the question remains—Why should a
right-thinking sharebroker yearn for that to
befall his native land which has been held
up for years as the blackest of calamities?
* * * *
One explanation is that the present Boom
has many of the features that precede a
Burst. Land-jobbing was never more rife.
In every suburb for miles around every State
capital, large, shiny and prosperous citizens,
likewise small and frowsy ones, are engaged
“cutting up estates,” and unloading them on
the public. It is not only in the immediate
neighborhood of the cities that this sort of
thing is going on. Arid land, which is hours
by buggy, tram or rail from any G.P.0., is
selling at 10 and 15 and in some cases 30
times the figure it would have fetched in
(say) 1903. The papers print the vast, and
frequently mendacious, advertisements of
these enterprises, and keep silent as to their
commercial unsoundness. Chiefly because
there is a shortage of attractive investments
in Australia to-day, the frugal man is dis-
posed to put his savings, or at any rate some
of them, into allotments. Failing that, he
may invest in a cinematograph co., or in a
new motor-garage, or in the latest theatre for
the perpetration of melodrama, or in a sea-
side hotel or restaurant, or vaudeville con-
cern. The prime danger of all this lies in
the fact that the public is dashing into these
things on the assumption, seemingly, that
the present fat times are never going to fine
down. And yet it is as certain as death
that our present prosperity must end some
time ; and it is as likely as disease that it will
end very soon. The first direction in which
the public economises when the pinch comes
is in its amusements. People start staying
away from theatres and picture shows. They
no longer buy or hire motor-cars. They
put up at hash-houses instead of hotels, and
have high teas at home instead of cham-
pagne meals at expensive restaurants. And
this is likewise the time when the bottom
falls through the land boom; and the specu-
lator’s victim finds that his £2OO block is un-
saleable at a fiver, and the bank manager
who has allowed overdrafts on the security
of land valued at boom prices repents the
transactions with profane language. The
pastoralists who have been wont to splash
round the cities after the fashion of Corin-
thians, stow their glad clothes where the
moths may not devour them, and get back
to their holdings and the gloomy old round
of skinning starved sheep and hand-feeding
live ones. Presently they find their way to
the back-parlor where the overdraft lies in
hiding; and the sickening arrogance of the
bank manager is resumed. The jumped-up
theatrical shows begin to burst. The white
ants invade the fences that encompass the
“desirable allotments.” Traders learn that
the golden epoch has closed. The country set-
tles grimly down to a further spell in the
financial shadows.
* * * *
The economic rottenness of this business,
which has been recurring in more or less
regular cycles for as long as the oldest in-
habitant can remember, is plain. The rea-
son why the Australian has little choice be-
tween putting his savings into more or less
ephemeral concerns which do widespread
damage when they burst, and sending it out
of the country for investment abroad, may
be exnressed in a brief phrase—an ineffective
tariff. Australia has every asset requisite to
make it a great manufacturing nation. It
has declared, at election after election, for
Protection. Yet, according to Knibbs’s
Official Year Book for this year, this
country imported in 1909, from the United
States alone, £1,732,853 worth of machinery.
In the same year it imported three millions
sterling worth of apparel, and £1,196,942
worth of woollen piece goods; also £418,716
worth of tinned and preserved fish, nearly a
quarter of a million pounds’ worth of furni-
ture, and £713,390 worth of bicycles and mo-
tors. And this is a mere fraction of the
total imports. The most furious of foreign
traders will admit that it is better business
for a country to invest its money in fish
canneries and furniture manufactories than
in picture shows. Iron works and woollen
mills have a habit of remaining na-
tional assets long after seaside pubs
have lost their licenses and gay restaur-
ants have filed their schedules. It is in-
finitely more profitable for the State to
make motor-cars than to stable them. But
in a new country a condition precedent to
such things is a tariff that really protects.
That Australia’s existing tariff fails miser-
ably to do the work it was built for is as
obvious as a light on a dark night. It is
not Labor legislation which is causing capital
to be withdrawn from the Commonwealth,
any more than it is Labor legislation which
is driving capital into nationally useless con-
cerns which must wilt at the first breath of
a drought. Capital is behaving in this
fashion because it can’t help itself. Some
day an Australian Government will material-
ise which is not dominated by the importing
interests of Melbourne and Sydney, and
which will accordingly have the nerve to
dower Australia with the Protec-
tion which has made America and Germany
great. And then capital will not have to
depart when a boom arrives, and the Aus-
tralian with money to invest locally will be
offered the chance of putting it into stable
concerns like woollen mills, steel works and
ship-building yards, instead of into enter-
prises whose existence largely depends on
the state of the weather. It will be a black
hour for land-speculators and shady company
promoters, but it will be a supremely fortu-
nate day for Australia.
ONCE MORE THE “DEAD HAND.”
In giving judgment last week in the special
case of the Federated Enginedrivers and
Firemen’s Association v. the Broken Hill
Proprietary Co., Ltd., C. J. Griffith em-
phasised the point that the Act “was de-
signed, however it might be applied, to pro-
mote industrial peace.” But what actually
is the effect of the High Court’s amazing de-
cision that the Engine-drivers and Firemen’s
Association “is not an association of em-
ployees in or in connection with any industry
within the meaning of Section 55 (b) of the
Arbitration Act, and is therefore incapable
of registering under the Act”? Well, one
effect which will he regarded with dismay by
all lovers of industrial peace is that the
award which the Federated Engine-drivers
and Firemen achieved some time ago in the
Federal Arbitration Court —an award which
all fair-minded employers have now come to
recognise was a just one—is rendered so
much waste paper. And, since the Engine-
drivers and Firemen are illegally registered
under the Act, so also are the Amalgamated
Society of Engineers, the Federated Carters
and Drivers’ Association, the Furniture
Trades Society, the Bread Carters’ Union,
the Plumbers and Gasfitters’ Union, the Can-
dle, Starch, Soap and Soda Employees’Union,
the Federated Painters and the Federated
Carpenters and Ironworkers. Countless
workers who have known what it was, ow-
ing to the Federal Arbitration Court’s
award, to earn decent wages, are liable to
find themselves back on scratch again, and
at the mercy of the sweating employer. Inci-
dentally, the employer who wants to pay fair
wages will find himself at the mercy of his
trade rival who wants to pay as little as
ever he can. What with the newly-dis-
covered difficulty as to the meaning of the
words _ “calling,” “employment” and “ser-
vice” in the definition of an industry, and
what with the difficulty in regard to
creating that “dispute” which the Court
has declared to be essential before
any industrial wrong can be redressed,
and what with the fact that no hu-
man being can define (in a legal manner of
speaking) just what a “dispute” is, the Fed-
eral Arbitration Act has been reduced to im-
potence and absurdity. Riddled as it is by the
interpretations which the High Court has put
on its powers under the Constitution, the Act
is of rather less value as a peace-promoter
than Peter Bowling.
* * * *
The other day the Melbourne Age —one
of the journals which were most vehement
during the Referenda campaign in denoun-
cing the suggested Constitutional amend-
ments —printed the following :
The “dead hand” of the Constitution of the United
States has again reached out to nullify an admit-
tedly wise and beneficent law. A Workmen’s Com-
pensation Act, drafted by a Commission of experts
upon the subject, and, as finally adopted by the
Legislature of New York State, modelled upon
humane and modern lines, has been declared by the
Court of Appeals of that State to be unconstitu-
tional. The argument of the Court is peculiar. It
seems to point to the conclusion that while monarch-
ies are able to adopt such laws —as almost every
country of Europe has —“free” America cannot do
so because of its Constitution. “Can a free people
be free?” asks a New York paper in commenting
upon the decision, and the question is justified by
the language of the Judges in this case.
The tragedy in connection with which the
Age smugly sympathises with the United
States is a frequent horror in this country.
Under the regime of an ultra-Conservative
Bench, the “dead hand” of our Constitution
is repeatedly to be seen nullifying “admittedly
wise and beneficent laws modelled upon hu-
mane and modern lines.” Britain affords a
horrible example of a modern country which
has no recourse to an Arbitration Court.
The Ton-y-Pandy strike approached the di-
mensions of a civil war a few months ago;
and at the time of writing, according to
the cables, the trade of Hull is paralysed by a
vast shipping strike, the districts round about
are “suffering from a scarcity of supplies”
(i.e., are starving), 10,000 rioters are peram-
bulating the city, and the police are “charg-
ing the mob and trampling women and chil-
dren under foot.” It was with the express
object of averting this sort of calamity that
the Australian Parliament passed the Fed-
eral Arbitration Act. The measure was in-
tended to right industrial wrongs, extending
over more tfian one State, wherever it found
them ; and the more wrongs it redressed, the
better it would be, in the opinion of both
Parliament and people. For many years
judges, lawyers, and the public generally
have proceeded placidly on the assumption
that the phrase '“any association of not less
than 100 employees in any industry.. .may
be registered (under the Act) as an Associa-
tion,” meant what it appears to any intelli-
gent layman to mean. In last week’s
test case the dissenting judgment of Justice
O’Connor (who has never been accused of
ultra-Democratic leanings) well expresses
the popular view
In construing a statute it must be conceded that
prima facie full value should always be given to the
language of the Legislature, and that where it is
sought in an enabling and remedial Act, such as
that now under consideration, to give to the words
which the Legislature had used a meaning more re-
stricted than that which they ordinarily bear, and
so narrow the operation of the enactment, some good
ground must be shown for such an interpretation.
In my opinion no good ground has been put forward
which could justify the narrow interpretation of the
sections in controversy, upon which the respondents
in this case are insisting. It is impossible, in my
opinion, to hold on any ground of reason, that an
interpretation which would lead to so restricted
an operation of the Act could carry out the will of
the Legislature as it is expressed on the face of the
enactment.
* * * *
An effect of what Justice O’Connor calls
the “narrow interpretation” put on the sec-
tion in question by a majority of the High
Court Judges is that large bodies of workers
finding that they are denied the legal relief
which they thought they had a right to and
which Parliament certainly intended them
to have, are talking strike. It is possible
that commonsense and good citizenship will
prevail, that employers will not seize the
chance that has been presented to them to
cause trouble, and that the community mav
be spared the horrors that the North of Eng-
land is going through. But, if that is so it
won’t in any sense be the fault of the ma-
jority of the members of that Court which
claims to have a yearning for industrial
peace. In the Engine-drivers and Firemen’s
case, as in so many others in the same juris-
diction, the “dead hand” of the Australian
Constitution has been employed by the High
Court to “nullify an admittedly wise and
beneficent law.” There is every likelihood, so
long as the Constitution of Australia ’or
that of its High Court Bench, or both, re-
mains unaltered, that this perilous state of
things will continue. What is Australia
going to do about it?
CORONATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Rain squalls swept the heaths upon the
scrubby moors between Point Nepean-road
and the sea; the lines of pines blew to-
wards the Dandenongs, for behind them was
the Antarctic depression with chopped ice
in it. Depressed fowls sought cover from
the blast; their feathers blown back in
tufts and ridges, so that they became agon-
ised gooseflesh and chilblains. Sandring-
ham hasn’t made all its streets and foot-
paths yet, and diphtheria germ and the
bacillus of typhoid shivered in their wind-
swept pools—safe there because the local
Squillses said that diphtheria must be
hushed up so that real-estate values might
not suffer. A depressed man in a vegetable
garden cut cabbages by the dozen to load his
cart for the morning’s market; his hands
were blue and his nose was blue, and he
had lost his handkerchief, and unpleasant
icicles formed in the dense thicket of his
whiskers.
Everything was depressed, from the Ant-
arctic to the cabbage. The ti-tree remem-
bered a sunny day three weeks ago ; and, as
it had seen a ray for ten minutes that morn-
ing, it had allowed itself to be swindled by
the same old confidence-trick that midwinter
always plays on vegetables and the young
man with the new light suit. The ti-tree,
like the rooster greeting candlelight with the
crowing that belongs to dawn, had put forth
its buds, only to meet the Antarctic depres-
sion, and was now very sorry tnat it had
spoken.
To the swindled ti-tree came a bright-
eye'd lady, chilblained like the fowls, but en-
thusiastic of the day; so that; let the Ant-
arctic depress himself ever so lowly, he
could never dim her pride, though he might
make her nose weep. Her kindly, foolish
face shone with “loyalty”; she walked by
the ti-tree as proudly as if she were not
merely to assist in celebrating a Coronation
by proxy many times removed, but as though
the actual ju-ju business was hers —the An-
ointing, and the Genuflections, and the Giv-
ing Out of the Bible, and the Taking of the
Bible Back Again, and the Laying-on of
Hands, and all the other ritual of savagery.
She stopped at a gap in the ti-tree and
hailed the man with the cabbage knife.
“Hey, mister, ain’t you going to it?”
The blue-nosed man turned and replied
with a question: “Goin’ to what !”
“The Coronation.”
He screamed back at her: “Not me!
Cabbitches!”
“Come to school and hear all about the
Grayshers King. Mr. Dogshall is going
to speak, an’ Mr. Puffball, too—all about
the King- and the open Bible.”
“I got me cabbitches.”
She yelled again: “Open Bible, wondrous
Bible —book divine.”
“Cabbitches.”
The gale got its second wind, and the
kindly, foolish lady gave up the contest and
breasted the rise towards the school. The
sudden down-turning from the gravel to the
peat brought her head-on to the full force of
the tempest, and made her teeth ache; but
she struggled on, warm inside with the
quenchless enthusiasm over nothing. The
fact that she arrived late at the school-
house disappointed her a little ; but Mr.
Dogshall was speaking to the assembled
children —speaking at large and intermina-
bly, cursing the wearier infants with value-
less information, and blasting their intelli-
gence with his adjurations. He told them
of anointing the King with holy oil and other
savage rites —himself a savage spreading
himself to gins and piccaninnies in a wet
camp.
“The King,” concluded Mr. Dogshall,
“then comes to his Throne, and then he—ah
—is crowned —yes, crowned. The —ah —
Archbishop of Canterbury pours the —ah —
sacred oil upon his head and gives him the
—ah—Bible —the holy Bible—and then he
—ah —gives it back again. And so he is
crowned and made King—over this glorious
Empire—on which the —ah—sun never —ah
—sets, and over the glorious British navy
—and the — ah—so on. And we must never
forget—that we belong to the —ah —glori-
ous British Empire and the glorious King,
and—so on.”
Each wondering and half-frozen child had
received its little medal—the cost being
charged to “Education” for some Chinese
reason or other —and the floor became the
property of Mr. Puffball, an unnecessary
little person obsessed by his own importance
and mad on the thrilling subject of the Walls
of Derry. Peculiarly enough, these people
believe “sectarianism” spells “loyalty” to
some nebulous thing or other; they are
proud of the doubtfully safe “possession”
of India, and ashamed of the Imperial pos-
session of Ireland —or at least of those
parts of Ireland south of Black Ulster.
Mr. Puffball told the infants things which
should be forgotten utterly or utterly abol-
ished ; of how the real function of an Eng-
lish King is to “protect” one sect against
all others; of the Almighty having taken
the Hanoverians under His special guid-
ance, the importation of Dutch William
and the Guelphs apparently being made im-
perative by the fact that the British are
such a miserably poor people that they
could not grow such an exotic thing as a
King on British soil. After that he emitted
another whoop for the'openness of the Bible
—which was mere vain-glory, seeing that in
m< si British communities it is the Book


most rarely opened except in church. Also he
told them of brotherly love —brotherly love in
a mean and snobbish little community* where
the young man from the sox department in-
terdicts grocers’ daughters at the local
dance!
And then the children went out to re-
freshments and sports of the good old
humorous British-peasant type —bobbing tor
treacled buns and chasing the greasy pig
and singing “Gor’save” to the gale; all un-
derstandable enough, for the intelligence
tuat respects kings is the intelligence that
laughs at the underclothing joke and the
mother-in-law joke, and is ready always to
grin through a horse-collar. , , ,
The small boys of the Naval Brigade had
studied and digested one of the great men s
eulogy on the British Navy, and they now ap-
proached him for a subscription to the local
detachment’s funds. The great Imperialist
looked at the growing defenders ot the Em-
pire—a look full of indulgence and benevol-
ence —and their hopes rose against the tact
of his reputation for extreme carefulness.
“I carn’t to-day, lads,” he said; “the
smallest change I got is tlirippens.”
But if the National uebt could be paid
with talk, that kind of man would work tor
three shifts, or for so long as an audience
might hold out. . . ~ ,
In the chilling dusk the kindly, foolish-
faced lady walked home past the vegetable
garden, her little soul filled with the mental
equivalent of flatulence. . , , , ..
The blue-nosed man had finished loading
his cart, and was strapping its tarpaulin
down over the freight.
“Y’ didn’t see the King crowned,’ said
the half-frozen lovalist.
“Didn’t want to see nobody drowned,
said the blue-nosed man. “Near got drowned
meself. I °ot no time for Coronations —I
got me cabbitches.”
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Toryfat Has a Bad Night.
’Since the Referenda foolishness, Toryfat
has been continuallv announcing that a re-
volt against “the domination of Labor” had
set in, and that the democratic cause was
doomed. Of course, Toryfat never calls it
•“the democratic cause” ; but that is what he
meant, and hoped. In particular, Victoria,
which did such shocking things to Tory-
fat’s representatives at the last Federal
elections, was pointed to as a prodigal
who was now tearing liot-foot aw T ay from
the Labor swine-troughs. Now, on top of
all this pleasant castle-building and day-
dreaming, has come the Bendigo East elec-
tion Bendigo East only became a State
Labor seat at the last elections, when a pop-
ular and strong man in the late Tom Glass
won it by the narrow majority of a little over
200 So the Wi mmen’s Fashionable League,
and the Illiberal League, and all the other
Tory associations went gaily into the fight,
with the halo of victory already around
their heads. They were so sure that they
very nearly ran two candidates; but at the
last minute they decided to make sure, and
coaxed one to retire. The Labor party ran
a man with the handicap of no fewer than
six previous defeats; and he was neither as
strong nor as popular as Glass. Yet he
romped in by a majority of over 500 votes.
Moreover, the election was conducted on the
old roll. The new rolls, compiled in the
same manner as the Federal rolls, contain
hundreds of new names, mostly those of
young men and women and hitherto-disfran-
chised laborers, three-fourths of whom will
certainly vote Labor. So Toryfat feels as
if an iceberg had slipped down his back, and
the defeated candidate announces that
Bendigo East under present conditions seems
to be a Labor constituency. The contest is
highly significant, in view of the general
elections that are to be held at the end of
the year. Acting-Premier Watt is straining
every nerve to strengthen the Government-
position. A big attempt is being made to
win the railway service by means of a re-
classification scheme, and money is being
ladled out to pretty well any country depu-
tation that asks for it. Nevertheless, it
seems more certain than ever that the net
result of the struggle will be the loss of
several Government seats; and Toryfat,
who was beginning to feel fairly comfort-
able, is having bad dreams, and is waking
in the night with the notion that Prender-
gast has hold of his wind-pipe. So all the
old wheezy leagues are to be oiled up and
set going again, and the prospect is not
a bit encouraging.

A Proposed Shipment of School Teachers.
The N.S.W. Education Department finds it-
self short of teachers, and Minister Beeby
says he may be obliged to import a half-
hundred or so. Before doing anything of the
kind, or while he is doing it, Mr. Beeby
might very reasonably consider whether the
shortage isn’t the best proof he could possibly
have of the failure of the present system of
recruiting home-grown teachers. Down to
about six years ago the pupil-teacher plan
was in force in N.S.W.; but it was con-
tended that the teachers produced by that
method were not sufficiently well educated,
so the trainee system was adopted instead.
The change may be well enough, provided
the trainee gets a sufficient amount of prac-
tical experience in teaching; and he and she
certainly are now getting more of it than
they did at the beginning. The trouble now
is that they don’t get enough pay. In a
broad and general way professions and call-
ings may be divided into two classes. In
class 1 the person starts off with moderate
pay, and never gets much more all his or
her life. The domestic servant of 18 can
thus command almost if not quite as much
as the Mary of 48. In class 2 there is
either no pay at all for some years, or very
little; and doctors, for instance, base on
that fact. the high charges they make when
they get into full bearing, so to speak. Un-
der the pupil-teacher system the pay was
pretty good right from the start. A lad of
18 might get £6O a year. That being so,
there was some excuse for paying him a com-
paratively poor salary in after years. In
plain words, teaching was put on the basis
of an unskilled trade. The new system
sought ostensibly to remove that blot. It
therefore provided for a period of training,
running to four years, and in the fourth
year all that the trainee gets is £25 a year.
To that extent the business was put more on
all fours with other learned professions. But
when the Department cut down the pay at-
taching to the early years of service, it for-
got to tack it on to the pay attaching to the
late years; so that, except as to a half-dozen
or so special schools, the maximum salary
for a teacher in N. S. Wales is £420 a year;
and very frequently the teacher doesn’t draw
that much, £75 of it being deducted for the
rent of a school-house, which may be, and
usually is, worth very much less than that.
At (say) 32 a teacher ought to be very
nearly as good as ever he will be; yet the
average pay of a male teacher of that age
would probably be found to be not more than
£l5O a year—-less pay, for the most import-
ant work in the community, than the indiffer-
ently-skilled tradesman can command. The
great majority of teachers never get beyond
£2oo a year; the few who climb up to a
first-class school have to go on submitting
themselves to graded examinations for (say)
20 years; and the man who has the pertin-
acity to stick to the examinations, and the
ability to pass them, coupled with the special
qualifications required of a successful teacher,
cannot reasonably expect to reach the dizzy
maximum height of £350 a year, plus house
accommodation, in less than 25 years. In
most cases it is considerably more than that.
After reaching the supreme height of a first-
class school, he may get one of half a dozen
or so special appointments; if not, there is
nothing in the way of promotion but an
inspectorship, involving travel and very fre-
quent absence from home —conditions which
appeal to very few men well up in years.
The trainees may be able to climb faster;
but they cannot be at all sure of it. And,
anyway, they cannot climb higher; for the
Department offers no higher things to climb
to. Naturally, in these circumstances, the
profession is not rushed. The Department
is, in brief, trying to make it a learned pro-
fession. involving the self-denial usual in
learned professions during the years of train-
ing and probation, without offering the
prizes which the other learned professions
give in after years to their successful fol-
lowers. And, as the proof of the pudding is
in the eating, so the proof of the failure of
the system lies in the fact that there is both
a present and a prospective shortage of men
and women to man (and woman) the teach-
ing staffs.

A Wise Proposal and Some Factors That
May Wreck It.
Over a year ago the Victorian Health De-
partment instituted an investigation into the
prevalence of a certain disease in that State.
The idea was to discover from town and
country doctors the extent to which the com-
munity was ravaged by it, and then “to
cause legislative measures to be taken to ef-
fect proper control of it.” The inquiry
closed on May 31, and the Government has
by this time in its possession a record of plain
facts calculated to make its spine congeal
with horror. Unfortunately, if past form
is any indication, this is about the only effect
the movement is likely to have. Victoria
already has an Act, passed as long ago as
1890, which is capable, if firmly adminis-
tered, of doing Considerable good. It con-
tains elaborate machinery for the compul-
sory docking and overhauling of the coffin-
ship of the streets. The calamitous vessel
may—on the sworn information of any
police-sergeant, or higher officer, that she
(the vessel aforesaid) follows the oldest
trade, and needs attention —be haled before
a P.M., and committed to hospital for any
period up to three months. If Salvarsan is
half as efficacious as the medical profession
claims, a course of three months’ treatment
with it should, in a large percentage of cases,
remove the patient’s capacity to act as a
distributing-centre for disease, even if it fails
to cilte her personally. And, in many in-
stances, it is likely that she will be cured
outright. In the past the Victorian Health
Act was not given a chance to justify itself.
When the late Dr. Ckesswell was Chair-
man of the Board of Health, he tried to give
effect to its provisions; but Wowserdom
arose as one Stiggins, and snuffled him
down. Ckesswell was assured that the
time was not ripe, that all right thinkers
were revolted at his conduct, and that Public
Opinion was looking for him with an axe.
After a • while he was persuaded that the
State resented his effort to rob it of its syphi-
lis, and retired from the fray with something
of the aspect of a detected burglar. As a
matter of fact, the general body of the pub-
lic was then, as it is now, perfectly willing
to have venereal disease dealt with. The
people are, after all, mostly sane, and sane
folks are no more attached to this scourge
than they are to diphtheria or plague. But,
in the first place, there is the Wowser. It
is his hideous theory that sinners should ex-
piate their offences, not only in the next
world, but in this. That in doing so they
may ruin the lives of innumerable innocents,
and pollute the very life-blood of the nation,
concerns the militant pietist not at all. The
other foe to the health-reformer is that false
shame which is part of our British heritage.
The papers scarcely dare print a word which,
in the interests of the public, should be writ-
ten and spoken as freely as words like “con-
sumption” and “fever.” In social life a pall
of mystery is deliberately cast over a ques-
tion which should be exposed regularly to the
daylight of frank discussion. If Victoria or
any other State means to get a strangle-hold
on its syphilis, it will first need to treat the
objecting citizen exactly as it would treat one
who inveighed against plague-protection mea-
sures—-namely, as a person of unsound mind
and a public menace. And it must educate
the community into the view that this is not
a subject that needs to be muttered about in
cellars, and behind furtive doors. Failing
successful campaigns in those two directions,
fresh legislation is of about as much practi-
cal value as boots in Paradise.
The Unions and the Doctors.
“Os Jxjnominatum” puts the case for the
British Medical Association in the matter
of the old row between that body and the
N.S.W. friendly societies: —
A deputation, including medical men who don’t
belong to the 8.M.A., waited on Acting-Chief Sec.
Flowers the other day, and made statements that
were untrue and misleading. First, the Minister was
told that there were 1500 doctors practising in
N.S.W. A pure fabrication. There are about 1000.
Then the number of B.M.A. men was put down at
700, whereas it is in the region of 800. It will thus
be seen how mendacious was the impudent assertion
that the Aus. Medical Association represented 800
practitioners in N.S.W. In point of there can’t
be more than 20 of them all fd'h ... against 800 in
the reputable association, i.t, P...±.A. The latter
has its own block of building., where it meets for
the discussion of medical, 'scientific, social and
ethical matters. It conducts its own medical jour-
nal, and gives its members the latest ideas on medi-
cal subjects. Its aim is to promote fair and honor-
able practice amongst its members. Now, if a medi-
cal man is being underpaid by friendly societies, how
can he give his hordes of patients proper attention
and carry on an honorable practice? It means that
he must slur over his work, make a spot diagnosis
(as often as not wrong), and frequently give inade-
quate treatment. It is the same old curse of cheap-
ness over again, only in this case the sweating em-
ployers belong mainly to the industrial classes.
The greatest curse of all is the Institute or Dis-
pensary system, and against this the B.M.A. has
been compelled to sternly set its face. And small
wonder. Several lodges in a district combine and
agree to pay (say) two medical men a fixed sum of
(say) £3OO a year each to attend all their members.
If such an institute starts with 750 members, the
remuneration would work out at about 16s. per
member per annum. But the trouble is that there is
no provision for increase of salary with increase of
numbers—no sliding scale. Hence the numbers go
up, often as high as 1500, with no corresponding
payment, or else there may be a paltry £25 a year
increase. Thus the doctors have twice the work to
do, their expenses are increased, and they have prac-
tically no time for a private practice or self-
improvement. Then another evil crops up. Two men
are paid equal salaries, but you can never equally
divide the work. The man who is more thorough
and painstaking and the greater favorite, gets the
greater share of the work; in other words, the man
who neglects his patients and makes himself objec-
tionable to them, or who may not be relied upon to
be sober, has the better time. Surely even a pack
of lunatics would abandon such a system! And yet
the champions of this system, both the masters and
the medical serfs (who are chafing now they find
themselves tight in the shackles they put on), have
the effrontery to ask for a Commission.
What is the situation, then? A handful of non-
unionists, who have taken up appointments from
which the union men resigned, at the call of their
union, found themselves in much opprobrium, and
thought they would try to cover it by giving them-
selves a name. They did so, and the A.M.A. was
formed. But no true unionist could ever regard
them as anything but a bogus union. They are pre-
pared to accept any terms from their “masters,” the
sweating branches of the friendly societies, and to
put up with any indignity, even to the extent of
going on a deputation with their “bosses” to the
Minister. If Mr. Flowers grants a Commission, it
would be equivalent to granting one to a combined
deputation of squatters and Machine Shearer union-
ists (if that defunct union, so rightly regarded as
“bogus” by every A.W.U. man, were resurrected),
to inquire into the ordinary unionist procedure of
the A.W.U., such as refusing to work alongside a
man who had blacklegged, etc. Every union is entitled
to this refusal; then why not the B.M.A. ? Surely
Donald Macdoneli/s locum will tread a very thorny
path if he grants the request of a bogus union for a
Commission to inquire into the ordinary unionist
procedure adopted by the genuine union representing
90 per cent, of the profession.
Very good ; but, if the B.M.A. has as strong
a case as it alleges, what has it to fear from
a Commission? In fact, why doesn’t it ask
for one itself? Obviously, though it insists
that its position is the true-unionist position,
it hasn’t had the good fortune to carry con-
viction to the minds of thousands who be-
lieve they are true unionists, and who
wouldn’t hire blackleg doctors if they were
convinced that they were blacklegs. _ If the
B.M.A. men can convince the unionists who
dominate the friendly societies that the op-
position union is bogus, their troubles will
be practically over. Hence why not rush
every opportunity to do the convincing—
even to the extent of saying “Hear, hear”
to a request made by the allegedly bogus
crowd, so long as the request is only for
more light?
Hope on a Rock.
Dk. Erasmus Wilson, the grandfather of
the great biologist who gave us the theory
oJt evolution, addressed to Josiaii Wedcj-
wood some prophetic lines on ‘‘The Visit of
Hope to Sydney Cove.” The apostrophe to
Wedgwood was evoked by the modelling ot
a medallion from clay brought by Sir Jos-
eph Banks from Botany Bay, and col-
lected by the famous botanist during the
Endeavor’s stay at Ivurnell in April-May,
1770. On June 5 last the Australian official
Coronators were entertained at the potter-
ies of Stoke-on-Trent, in Staffordshire —the
county in winch old Joseph . yVedgwood,
the potter, achieved both artistic fame and
a substantial fortune. They were treated
to a luncheon at the Town Hall. The Mayor,
who presided, was another Wedgwood, a
descendant of the glorious old potter who
founded Etruria. But the gentleman seems
to be somewhat hazy concerning his family
history. When he proposed the health of
the guests, he stated that his great ancestor,
in 1789, had received from Sir Joseph
Banks some clay which Captain Cook had
obtained in Sydney Cove, and with it had
made a number of medallions, in which Hope
was represented standing on a rock. As a
matter of fact, neither Cook nor Banks ob-
tained any clay in Sydney Cove, simply be-
cause they were never there, and knew
nothing of its existence. Sydney Cove
was so named in 1788 (18 years
after Cook landed in Botany Bay)
by Governor Arthur Phillip, after
Thomas Townsiiend, Viscount Sydney,
Secretary for Home Affairs in the Pitt
Ministry; for in those days “the colonies”
were administered by the Home Depart-
ment, from a branch called the “Office for
Plantations,” which also dealt with the
affairs of Ireland. Sydney Cove is an inlet
about seven miles from the Heads; and it is
well known that Cook never even entered
the Heads, satisfying himself by naming the
harbor, as he sailed past it, in honor of Sir
George Jackson, one of the Secretaries of
the Admiralty. Mr. Mayor Wedgwood ap-
pears to know nothing, either, of the adap-
tation of the design on the medallion to the
reverse of the first Great Seal of N. S.
Wales. That design was something more,
too, than “a figure of Hope standing on a
rock.” There were the convicts landing at
Botany Bay (which, by the way, they never
did), received by Industry—surrounded by
such of her attributes as a bale of merchand-
ise, a pickaxe, and a shovel —who releases
them from their fetters and points to
ploughing oxen, and a rising town on a
neighboring hill, with a fort for its protec-
tion, while the masts of a ship are seen in the
bay. Heraldically, this is a finer coat-of-
arms for the wearing of Josiaii Wedg-
wood’s descendants than any the College
of Heralds can grant, though the good Mayor
of Stoke-on-Trent seems to know little about
it.
♦
A gasp of pretended amazement goes up
from the Victorian Tory press, caused, by
the *following figures relating to the distribu-
tion of the Commonwealth land-tax pay-
ments :—
N. S. Wales £570,408
Victoria .. .. -. - • 518,161
S. Australia .. .. •• •• 116,833
Queensland .. .. .. . • 71,417
Westralia .. .. .. • • 30,689
Tasmania .. .. .. • • 29,372
Total .. .. •• £1,337,180
On these figures, the cry is raided in the
Argus and elsewhere that the tax is Avick-
edly disproportionate to population, and so
on. This alleged argument really amounts
to a good joke. The tax Avas designed, not
to touch up the populated lands, but. to reach
the regions where land monopoly is at its
worst. It was therefore intended that Vic-
torian squatterdom should pay heavily. But
if the squatters, wffiose friends now weep be-
cause the figures suggest that the tax prom-
ises to be partially successful, will cut up
their estates, they will speedily find their pay-
ments reduced. If they will partition them
up into small Dlocks of less than £5000 un-
imnroved value, with a cultivator’s family on
each block instead of a mere brood of sheep,
then, instead of paying £518,461, Victoria
will not nay one penny. Not one single
brown.
The British population has increased by
nearly 5,000,000 in 10 years; but before the
drum’s are banged in rejoicing, the 5.000,000
ought to be analysed The vaunted policy
of an open door —an open door for rags,
steel, third-class men, and anything else cal-
culated to shorten the rations of the de-
scendants of Vikings—is getting in more
deadly work tnan its strongest opponents
thought likely. Through that entrance pours
a stream of all the cheap and inferior human
material of Europe, with odd scraps of Asia
and Africa. When crews of Chinamen were
wanted to assist in breaking the maritime
strike, there was no need to rake Hong-
kong or the Straits Settlements for them.
They signed on at Cardiff. If that door is
allowed to remain open, the population of
England in 25 years Avill be as mixed as
that of Tnursday Island. And yet there
are people Avho would seriously try to per-
suade us that there is no need to go in for
Australian defence. With the Australian
door closed, and the English door open, the
aims and objects of the people on opposite
sides of the world must become more and
more divergent; and Sydney may still be
speaking the tongue of William Shak-
speare when St. Paul’s is a Buddhist tem-
ple, and The Times is printed in a modified
Hindustani which has learned to use the
Russian characters for the convenience of
Lithuanian readers.

Although there is less trade robbery by
unjust scales and measures in Sydney than
there was a few years ago, there is still far
too much. The fault is to be laid at the'
door, not of the inspectors, but of the laws,,
which are full of holes through Avhich the-
scaler and the balancer can crawl. Not
long ago, for instance, an appeal against
the conviction of a baker for making light-
weight loaves Avas upheld because the in-
spection was made before daylight. Most
of the bread constructed in the metropolitan
area is passed out of the bakehouses to the
delivery carts before daylight; hence this
ruling makes it quite impracticable to carry
out any inspection worth the name, and the
light-weight rogue has little to fear from
anything except his conscience. The saim*
applies to coal, the Sydney Coal Delivery
Act being so useless that for years past no
action has been taken by the Weights
and Measures office to enforce its pro r
visions. Past Governments have beep
A Boom in “Peace.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Japan, England and America are busy falling on
each other’s necks in the transports of a new arbi-
tration-and-general-'Tll-be-good” corroboree.
Have the nations drawn closer together, with
tears in their penitent eyes;
Are they tying themselves in a_ tether ot
peaceful complexion and size?
If they are, then prepare for the shindy,
keep your eyes most remarkably clear;
For when statesmen grow fulsome aud windy,
then war and disturbance are near!
Yea, they talk with one hand pawing
Heaven, and the other concealing an axe r
When they prate of all things being forgiven,
pray examine the hands at their backs.
Though the Jap and the Yank weep together,
though they shed sudden rivers of grease,
Keep your eyes firmly fixed on the weather,
and beware of the booming of “Peace ;
For we’ve witnessed these fervid proceedings
on sundry occasions before ; '
And when .Peace forms the substance ot
pleadings, it is mostly a prelude of war:
“By your leave,” says the Jap to the Rus-
sian, “we’ll agree to forget Liao-yang :
Says the Frenchman likewise to the Prus-
sian, “We’ll let Alsace go cheerfully
hang!”
And the Yank sort of smiles rather frantic.
and observes to his relative Bull :
“Let us shake o’er the Gard-dam Atlantic,
for my hands have grown suddenly full.
But the Jap and the Russ and the Prussian
from their launching of ships never
cease —
When the Yank and the Jap get to gushin’,
then beware of the fragments of
“Peace”!
Keep an eye, if you like, on the cables, and
expand, if you please, with delight;
But as cats lift their yowls on the gables, so
the nations are spoiling for fight.
And the Yank and the Jap and the Prussian,
being old at the game, sort of smile ;
And the Frenchman and Bull and the Rus-
sian keep their guns loaded up all the
while! , . „ ,
They are friends, if vou please, whilst you
listen, unto Gkey and our friend Vvilly
Taft; ..
But their eyeballs at times seem to glisten,
not with joy, but with cunning and
craft!
And as cats swiftly leap into battle, so the
nations their war-dogs release —
Yea, the shells and the shrapnel’s loud rattle
often spoil these orations of “Peace .
So, my friends of this small, sucking Nation,
get a large, solid bolt for your door;
Also hustle with White Immigration, and pre-
pare for red ruin and war!
For the land that is fooled into dreaming,
whilst the statesmen perfervidly swell,
Often wakes with a start to the screaming
and the swift ricochet of the shell!
When the nations draw closely together,
there are saurian tears in their eyes;
They are sparring for breath, and a tether
is tied with their mutual lies.
“We’ll be good,” chant the nations in chorus,
“let’s grow friendly and calm and
obese”*
But — the guns with their anthem, sonorous
play a dirge o'er the carcase of “Peace” !

urged repeatedly to put through amending
Acts that will protect the public; but no-

Mills, of Milwaukee, who is touring
Maoriland under engagement to the M.L.
Trades Council Federation and Labor party,
has been dropping a sizable piece of ice down
the backs of his red-rag comrades in the
Isles of Borrow. The red-rag comrades have
worked themselves up to explosion point on
the subject of military training, and are in
the habit of frantically howling: “Down
with conscription! We stand for Universal
Brotherhood, and the yellow brother will
not hurt us!” Hearing that Mills had
been American delegate to the Peace Confer-
ence in London, one brother at Masterton
jumped up and asked Mills what his opinion
of compulsory military training was. By
the time the opinion had been given, the
brother was feebly wondering what had hit
him. “My opinion,” drawled Mills, “is
that, while militarism lasts —and it will last
for some time yet—you had better arm every
citizen, establish a gun and ammunition fac-
tory, _ and let every man keep his gun and
cartridges, at home. The voluntary system
is a farce; only men who are drunk or can-
not battle for a job enlist, and they are the
most dangerous class to trust in time of in-
dustrial trouble. If every man is armed and
trained, and has a gun, there will be no use
for troops during a strike—and if you take
my advice, you’ll arbitrate and not strike —-
and then also, if (as is possible) interna-
tional complications arise, Maorilanders will
be prepared.” Years ago the M.L. Trades
Councils decided for compulsory as against
volunteer service ; and though the local Labor
party has international arbitration as a
plank, it isn’t fool enough to want to sit
unarmed and address words of welcome and
comradeship to the armed invader, who pro-
bably wouldn’t understand “colonial Eng-
lish,” anyway.

The Parliament of N. S. Wales is to tackle
a problem of the ages in an effort to regu-
late and improve the condition of genius
and its little brother, literary and artistic
talent. A denutation of the representa-
tives of the craft to which King David,
Phil May, Sophocles, Martin Tupper,
Horace, and W. Shakspeare belonged—
not to mention Alfred Alstin, “Belle-
rive,” and Rudyard Kipling in our own
time —called upon Mr. Beeby last week to
ask that they might be definitely included
among the “industrial workers” for whose
benefit Wages Boards and Arbitration
Courts are designed. The Minister re-
ceived tljiem like long-lost brothers; and, in-
terrupting the first speaker, folded them to
his sympathetic heart. He declared that he
had heard their wailing among the seats of
the mighty, and would give them an oppor-
tunity to wail before a just tribunal set up
to examine their claims. The Writers and
Artists’ Union will thus be placed in the
position of being able to try to do things.
How long these things are or how numerous
remains to be seen. Until occult science or
some _ kindly branch of learning evolves a
machine by which to measure with exacti-
tude the merit of a poem, drawing or storjq
it would seem that that old machine —the
editor —must still fill a large place in the
literary or artistic scheme of things. The
Writers and Artists’ Union recognises that;
yet it sees no reason why it shouldn’t get
whatever lift the new machine can give,
even though the lift may not carry it very
far. Besides, with even a little lift, the
craft may have more strength to battle on
its own account for the other things that
matter.

“O.K” on the abolition of class distinc-
tions :
For Some weeks I have been chewing the political
doctrine of Josiah Thomas, of the Federal Labor
Ministry, as expressed in his lecture on “The Fall of
Empires,” and I can’t swallow it. When Thomas
states that the gospel of Christ means the abolition
of class distinctions, I admit the fact, but I am re-
minded that Christ, anyhow, stood in a class by
Himself. He had followers who grovelled to Him all
the time, and when He chose 12 disciples He created
an aristocracy of holiness right away. No; cant as
we may, we won’t dodge class-distinctions in this
world. We start with them at school, where the boy
and girl masses are divided into classes, and the
teachers are lords or ladies over all. Later on we
find that Josiah Thomas, P.M.G., is not in the same
.class in the Government service as the letter-sorter.
In fact, Josiah is a Government boss and not a ser-
vant at all, and his salary will always keep him off
the level occupied by the struggling toilers who try
to take him seriously. When he states that people
■can't have “Christian brotherhood” whilst they
■“stand to each other in the relation of employer and
•employed,” I agree with him again, and I want to
know how he would run the Post Office in a Christian
manner? If the discharging of an employee is the
sinful exercise of “class,” what would Josiah do
with a grasping Judas letter-carrier who habitually
robbed the mailbag? Thus far I have agreed with
Josiah’s assertions, but I differ from him when he
says that the possibility of a beautiful brotherhood
of man is proved by “the fact that so many men
and women are ready to renounce the joys of family
life in order that they may more efficiently min-
ister to the wants of others.” As a matter of fact,
these professing pietists constitute themselves into a
class of the “cloth,” which demands reverence from
non-wearers, and has been ranged on the side of the
high authorities ever since class-distinctions were
established.

“The Gay Grisette,” the new musical piece
at the Criterion, is a winner in one respect:
nothing so frankly imbecile has been pre-
sented to Sydney leg-show patrons for years.
It is of the old order of musical extrava-
ganza, and the trail of the early ’9o’s is all
over it. As a fair average type of
song-and-dance farce of French origin
or inspiration (it is a blood-relation
of such concoctions as “Morocco Bound,”
“The Lady Slavey,” “The Shop Girl,”
etc.), “The Gay Grisette” contrasts in-
terestingly with the Austrian-built article
which has such a vogue nowadays. It im-
presses on one that the old-time adaptation
from, or imitation of, the Palais Royal farce
was much more boisterous and much less
sentimental than the modern product of
Vienna. Also it was less suggestive, and,
withal, more spicy. As a mild smoking-
room yarn is to “Three Weeks,” so “The
Gay Grisette” is to “The Merry Widow.”
The present-day show, as witness “The Waltz
Dream” and “The Balkan Princess,” makes
a definite effort to tell some sort of story; a
characteristic of its forerunners was to let
coherence slide, and encourage the performers
to get out of the picture as often and as
completely as they wished. Taking one
thing with another, the summing-up of the
Court is strongly in favor ®f the newer
fashion in musical-comedy form.
* * * *
As regards characterisation, “The Gay
Grisette” contains all the old identities that
we knew in earliest youth. Captain Jack
Canary is a sprightly, raffish hero, after the
manner of Seymour Plicks. He pervades
the European Continent with a weirdly im-
probable man-servant, and a quartette of
show-girls who are seeking legal or other re-
dress from a military person who promised
to marry and then deserted them. An Afri-
can princess—a cannibal, and a flamingly
over-dressed one at that —arrives, hot on the
trail of a one-time victim to her charms.
There is a Sultan, anxious to make his score
of 99 wives the round century; and an Irish
solicitor hurries feverishly round beneath a
gleaming tall hat, in quest of the heir to
an earldom and £lO,OOO per annum. They
foregather in the grounds of a French girls’
school. Eroticism is the dominant note of
this establishment. The elderly principal
worships the male sex, and so do all her
charges. When the maidens desire a visit
from the neighboring garrison they hoist the
Union Jack —and it may be added that the
grand old flag is in pretty constant requisi-

tion. Particularly enthusiastic where the
men are concerned is the flapper-heroine.
Babette. As her young friends put it in a
stirring chorus, “The Gay Grisette is a
Great Coquette”—which, if anything, under-
states the case. A parson, in appearance
and habits the immemorial Wowser, is one
of the few characters who chases not, but,
instead, is chased. He and the Hibernian
attorney aforesaid are about the only folks
present who appear in any way fitted to lead
the celibate life. After all hands have collec-
tively and individually comported themselves
like highly-trained lunatics for a period of 2J
hours or thereabouts, the solicitor suddenly
saddles Canary with the earldom, whereupon
the latter marries Babette and the uproar
terminates.
* * * . *
Miss Florence Imeson isn’t a grisette, and
she doesn’t resemble a schoolgirl, but in every
other respect her impersonation of Babette
is unimpeachable. Her plaintive refrain, “I
Wonder if You Miss Me Sometimes” (echoed
by the military without, in a thunderous
howl, suggestive of an army chanting a
battle hymn), is the last note in allurement:
and her dancing is excellent. Frank Lin-
coln, as Canary, does all the things that are
expected of that type of character, and does
them well. Tom Graves’s cleric is alone
worth the entrance-money. The humor of
Percy Clifton (Colonel Pom Pom) is over-
done in spots; but he has one good song and
brings down the house with it. The minor
rQles are as well handled as they deserve, and
the scenery is attractive.
IBSENS “ JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN ,”
at the New Melbourne Repertory Theatre.
F. NORRIS as Borkman.
“Hamlet” has been playing to great houses
at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) for the last 10
nights. Some meritorious features that were
crowded out of this paper’s notice last week
are the Ophelia of Miss Dorothea Baird (an
impersonation full of grace and pathos), the
King of Frank Tyars, and the excellent
comedy of Tom Reynolds as the First Grave-
digger. On Friday week “Hamlet” retires,
giving place to “The Lyons Mail.”

There are some newcomers in the cast of
“The Balkan Princess” at Sydney Theatre
Royal. Miss Dorothy Brunton (a daughter
of scenic-artist Brunton, deceased) now plays
the part of henchwoman or female A.D.C. to
the Princess with infinite grace and charm.
Also, the ranks of the show-ladies have re-
cently been augmented by two sisters who
don’t need to utter a word to simply pulverise
the arguments of those who contend that
Australia doesn’t produce beautiful girls.

Sydney Adelphi is still “Driving a Girl
to Destruction” amidst loud applause. It
is estimated that the second villain has
already thrown the cripple boy’s loaf of
bread down 871 miles of alley, and that the
cripple boy himself has climbed 40,000 ft.
through fanlights, windows, etc. Some re-
cords in these athletic byways will be broken
before George Marlow produces from his
sleeve the next theatrical trump with the
combined drawing-power of an ocean tug
and a blazing warehouse.

F. S. Kelly, the Australian pianist who

night.

Spissell Brothers and Mack, who fall
about humorously for a living, and Alf.
Holt, who travels in mimicry and whistling,
are the most recent guests to hang up their
advertising banners on the turrets of Sydney
Tivoli, where Baron Rickards receives tri-
bute from his serfs and vassals, and nightly
causes to be performed the ancient rite
known as “the first part.” Both new turns
help to put a head on a bill which was not
by any means flat before they arrived. The
other headliners are Francis and Alfred
(comedy jugglers), comedian Ted Kalman,
Arthur Croxon, the pair of dancing Lillies,
Iveldine and Kliino, and Fanny Powers,
whose study of Julian Rose is an admirable
addition to her “imitations of artists I have
seen and heard.”

Miss Toby Claude arrived at the National
Amphitheatre on Saturday. She is as cute
a circumstance in her line as any local
music-hall has starred for a long time back.
She has some diverting songs, and one of
them enables a considerable expanse or tract
of back—that back which has won eulogy in
three continents —-to be exhibited to dazzled
audiences. Other noteworthy lures at this
show are Anita Diaz and her troupe of
monkeys, and the four Musical Gardiners.

Spencer’s picture show at Sydney Ly-
ceum, after doing excellent business with
“The Lyons Mail” and the English Derby of
1911—the former ranking among the best
of the drama pictures yet shown—has got
into a new goldfield that offers wonderfully
fine opportunities. “The Crusaders” is
the name of the new film; and the title alone
suggests the possibilities of the new and
hitherto strangely-neglected patch. The
series will begin to unwind its 4000 ft. next
Monday night.

Gregan McMahon’s team of repertory
players gave their first exhibition in improv-
ing drama at the Melbourne Turn Verein
Hall early last week. The entertainment,
which included a bright performance of the
second act of “The Critic,” was mostly de-
voted to the production of “The Two Mr.
Wetherbys,” Hankin’s amiable essay in do-
mestic comedy. In this play Hankin in-
dulges in mild and persuasive iconoclasms.
He batters down a few conventions, and
leaves James Wetherby, a household “idol,”
stripped of his fictitious reputation as a pat-
tern saint. Gregan McMahon, in the part
of Richard Wetherby, strongly assisted in
the process of reducing James in his moral
status; while G. H. Crosby and the Misses
Smith and Hungerford employed their obvi-
ous abilities in portraying other characters
in the cast. On Thursday night another
party of McMahon’s amateurs made a much
more ambitious appearance in “John Gabriel
Borkman,” a study of a poet-financier. Crav-
ing for authority and boundless power, he
sacrifices love and the homelier virtues to
his enormous and admittedly noble ambi-
tions. Soon he involves himself in hopeless
ruin, and at the beginning of the play is
found in the gallery of his house mainly in
the company of idealistic dreams. The spec-
tacle of this broken mystic thinking the
world well lost for his faded illusions, is
more moving than the tragical motifs in the
drama. Borkman is poignantly interest-
ing, and F. Norris played the character with
strength and force. Ella Rentheim received
sympathetic treatment from Miss Maud Jol-
liffe, and Miss Rene Tanswell gave good ex-
pression to the cold egomania of Mrs. Bork-
man. J. Fowler was oddly attractive as
Vilhelm Foldal ; and, concerning Miss Moore
as Mrs. Wilton, it is a sort of compliment
to say that the difference between her read-
ing of the part and the part itself was pos-
sibly all the difference between a lady and a
female.
** * *
“A Fool There Was” might have done
much better with more time; but it hap-
pened in a brief interval between the de-
parture of a success and the arrival of a suc-
cessor. Porter Brown wrote this melodrama
with the deliberate intention of giving the
public what it likes; but, like managers who
start out with the same laudable intention,
he bases his high resolve on a limited defini-
tion. He fixes in his own mind on a certain
level of intelligence, a certain degree of
taste, and thinks he has a compendium of
popular fancy; but you can’t make certain
of getting the public that way, any
more than you can rely upon drawing ail
sorts and conditions of people to a drama
composed of “Hamlet,” “The Doll’s House,”
“The Silver King,” and “The Face at the
Window.” However, Brown, in the course
of his experiment, appears to have struck a
definite strata of public partiality, and his
worst woman is a good thing financially.
On Saturday night next Brown is to be dis-
placed by Mason, whose “The Witness for
the Defence” introduces Miss Ethel Irving,
of London, Eng., a lady who lately was only
second in importance to the Coronation,
judging by Melbourne newspapers, and now
beats that exploded function hollow.

“Our Miss Gibbs” is happening at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.) every evening at 7.50 with
the regularity of an astronomical movement,
and would appear to have become a. habit
with a large number of middle-aged citizens,
who give the stalls a certain appearance of
bald monotony to those moving in higher
circles. “The Dance Du Vaurien” is as
familiar as the boarding-house procession
to breakfast, and that other foreign item,
“Yip-I-addy-I-ay,” is scarcely more exciting
than grace before meat by reason of its un-
reasonable frequence, the epidemic having
spread to the suburbs, and broken out in
10,000 upright pianos. Still, profitable audi-
ences are always in attendance. Melbourne’s
floating population drifts into Exhibition-
street in response to a sort of natural law
that has nothing to do with gravity.

“Nobody’s Daughter” was given another
week at large, and the affecting story of the
sin that lay dormant for 20 years, and then
exploded with a loud report, and blew two
families into a state of domestic chaos, does
not retire in favor of Clyde Fitch’s rural
entertainment, “Lovers’ Lane,” till after
Friday night’s performance. On Saturday,

“The Favorite,” at Melbourne King’s, is
now introducing Miss E. Duggan in the role
of a negligent owner of horses. The lady
pursues her hobby without forgetting that
the gown of a duchess is the most appropri-
ate costume for the most menial occupation.
She wears several bright frocks, which
serve to remove one’s attention from the fact
that she is repeating her set of six postures
and three kinds of smile. The next charac-
ter in point of importance is the villain,
Rutland Beckett, who tries “to nobble the
favorite” and murder Miss Duggan on the
top of a house. Knowing that to be intelli-
gent is to gain a reputation for eccentricity,
Beckett follows the safe plan of committing
silly crimes for much more silly reasons.
Two grotesques assist him in his amazing
deeds, and these persons perform their duties
with an excessive display of the comic
spirit. The parts are represented by Bailey
and Harrison. Roy Redgrave pictures the
character of the Hon. Harry Stirling with
pleasant sincerity; while Ned Duggan’s
hearty portrayal of Joseph Silver is a fine
demonstration of eyebrows and well-booted
feet.

Of the present Opera House co., “Mar-
guerite Ismay and Girls” call for the earli-
est consideration. The young ladies indulge
in a form of wooden-mat dancing, and ex-
pend a heap of energy without any remark-
able artistic result. Among other perform-
ers, Miss Charmeroy is fingering her piano,
and Lamberti continues his imitations. Also
there are Fred Bluett, Reichen’s good dogs,
the two Pi’ices, and the generally effusive
Cadwall and Verne.

The Vic. Proiessional Orchestra, which
has the best wishes of musical free-
thinkers, and the bitter enmity of the
worshippers of Marshall Hall, burst into
evidence again at Melbourne Town Hall the
other Tuesday afternoon. The audience
might have been much larger, but the roar of
applause at the end of the third section of
Tschaikowsky’s “Pathetic” Symphony must
have put the players on good terms with
themselves —barring only the trombones, who
committed one or two sad indiscretions dur-
ing the afternoon. Bizet’s “L’Arleslienne”
suite and the overture to “Flying Dutch-
man” were in the second half of a programme
that rather exceeded the 90 minutes allotted
to it. Zelman conducted this first concert
and will shake the stick again sometimes
hereafter; but the idea of the V.P.O. is to
have a variety of talent at the desk, includ-
ing brothers Slap, and Joseph Bradley, from

Sydney. Eight concerts in all are projected,
to be given always on a Tuesday, commenc-
ing at the unusual hour of 4 o’clock. It would
probably be a better arrangement to strike
up at 3.45 p.m., and make the first half of
the programme a curtain raiser to the piece
de resistance. It seems clear enough that
even the best of Melbourne orchestras cannot
thrive at present on the support of genuine
musical maniacs, the demented ones being
insufficiently numerous. Therefore, any de-
vice for capturing the moderately musical
crowd is worth experimenting with.

A male pianist who proclaims himself
English, and wears his hair moderately
short, and doesn’t prolong his recital with
“encore” pieces, has captured the affections
of all those Melbourne people who rallied
to the Carreno performances of yore. Leon-
ard Borwick is an artist of the unaggressive
order, with a particular talent for touching
the piano lightly and getting a singing tone
from the notes. He puts “soul” into his
reading of the music of many masters, and
is, in short, an interesting entertainer who
makes no attempt to present outward and
visible symptoms of genius. Thus far, he
has given three recitals at the Town
Hall, and one at the Athenaeum, and
next Saturday afternoon he will play
some more in the bigger building.
On this occasion he will clash with the
final matinge of Sousa’s Band at the Exhibi-
tion Building; but Borwick appeals to a
public which has already begun to reprove
itself for its weakness as regards the band.
In the most intensely refined circle the band
is now spoken of as a popular intoxicant,
suitable only for the beer-drinking classes.
And the multitude with the popular thirst is
certainly rushing to Sousa’s bars of music.

West (Melbourne), who has been making
people better acquainted with “Our Navy,”
has also been unrolling “Woodcutters in the
Tyrol,” which furnishes glimpses of Tyrolese
peasants, pastimes and sports. Other pic-
tures recently screened included “Tontolini
and the Straw Hat,” a wild comic film ; “La
Favorita,” a pictorial adaptation of Doni-
zetti’s opera; and “Her Child’s Honor,” an
odd domestic drama with an unimpeachable
moral.

At the Prahran Lyric (Vic.) recent audi-
ences have been watching the birth and de-
velopment of a mushroom, besides getting-
many views of birds and beasts at the Lon-
don Zoo. People have also taken interest in
the tragedy of a clown, and have noted the
capers of a reverend gent who borrowed his
adventures from “What Happened to Jones.”
Incidentally, much admiration has been
lately excited by a brave Red Indian who
rescues a che-ild from bold, bad whites. At
the Lyric all Red Indians are noble, though
in real life they are often strangers alike to
sentiment, scruples and soap.

The Adelaide Tivoli still has a strong co.,
headed by R. A. Roberts, whose time in Aus-
tralia is coming to an end. Peggy Pryde
makes a welcome reappearance; and among
the others are Eunice and Zena, finished
musicians; Sydney Bach, a cheery soul from
Wales; and Scot Gibson, from Scotland,
equally cheery though more sophisticated.
Also Irving Sayles galvanises and holds to-
gether the first part as no other man can.
Sousa and his band have moved on, after
filling the Exhibition, day and night, fox-
most of a week. Sousa’s manager is Nigel
Bi-ock, an old Adelaide amateur. The Royal’s
week of “Charley’s Aunt” showed R. C.
Tearle as a pleasantly easy and humorous
Aunt, supported by local amateurs under
assumed names. These young people,
trained on Galsworthy and Shaw by the Lit-
erary Theatre, sailed briskly and effectively
through the old farce. (Time affects these
things in odd ways. The fizz of a syphon,
heard “off,” and telling that father is having
a stiff b. and s. before proposing to the
widow, is a mild substitute for the pop of a
sodawater-cork which used to announce the
same.) The Marlow co. has now come in
with “A Girl’s Temptation,” a subject on
which Adelaide takes up the pose of knowing
nothing, though willing to learn. West’s
pictures are specialising in the army and
navy: the Wondergraph at the Town Hall
has a French rendering of Irving’s “Lyons
Mail” ; while the Lyceum and the Vitascope,
having thoughtfully had an operator and a
camera present at the Deluge and at the
great nail-driving contest, Jael v. Sisera, are
now reaping the reward of their enterprise.
The servant trouble is spreading in the
Commonwealth Ministry. Kink O’Malley
has now announced that he is going to dis-
continue the use of formal endings to his
correspondence, and from this out isn’t going
to have the honor to be anybody’s “obedient
servant.”
Vic. Attorney-General J. Dry Brown ob-
served the other day :
I regard it as a most hopeful sign, that whilst the
population is steadily rising, the number of prisoners
in our gaols is gradually decreasing.
VV ell, Dry Brown has the keys; so what is
to stop him making the place a perfect
paradise by liberating all the prisoners?
As a start, he recently, by virtue of his
powers under an amending Crimes Act, re-
leased seven perjurers who had served about
a third of their two years’ term; and when
men who pollute the fountain of justice
are freed, almost any other sort of prisoner
who is kept a prisoner has good reason to
complain of the injurious differentiation, as
B. Smith would say.
“Melb’s” send-off to his old cook: —
I wave adieu to Estevan Parer, better known by
his English first name of Stephen. There were four
Parer brothers: Frank, Steve, Philly, and Johnny.
Frank came to Melbourne first, from Spain; but
Steve proved the masterful man. He could not
speak English, yet in two years he had got along
well enough to partner with Martin Arenas in the
Spanish Restaurant, Bourke-street, now Cole’s Book
Arcade. Next the Parers were heard of at the Duke
de la Victoria Restaurant, the time-honored “Duke.”
Steve had imported brothers Phil and John. When
they had made enough, all three returned to .their
native Spanish town of Alella, where the three were
married to their old sweethearts on the same day.
It was characteristic of the sturdy Parers, and of
their donnas, this waiting. They all three came
back to Australia, and now there is a goodly colony.
Send us such! But such are not sent —they have
the pluck to come. The Parers were lucky in coming
before the State stopped issuing hotel licenses to
restaurants; but, though they could thus fix you up
with the drink, the eating has always been the lead-
ing article in their faith. In the boom they put
the profit on many a thousand meal into land, and
got badly knocked about; but their ship righted.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Lud” : Sketch of the career of Irving, sen. Pupil
of Hoskins, 1854-5. First stage appearance in Sun-
derland, 1856. Became a stock actor in Edinburgh,
supporting Barry Sullivan and other stars. Acted
elsewhere with Brooke, after that actor’s return
from Australia. First London appearance, 1859 ;
small part in “Ivy Hall.” Immediately returned to
the provinces. Joined with Maccabe in exposing the
Davenport Brothers at Liverpool. Became leading
man at Manchester, following Neville and preceding
Dampier. Was the original Redburn in “The Lan-
cashire Lass” at Liverpool. Made a hit in Manches-
ter in Boueicault’s “Hunted Down.” Boucicault
procured his re-appearance in London, after seven
years, as Doricourt, in “The Belle’s Stratagem.”
Engaged at the .Queen’s, with Toole. Did well in
sundry plays. After seeing him as Sikes, Dickens
said he would be a great actor. Succeeded in “The
Two Roses,” at the Vaudeville, 1870. Engaged by Bate-
man for the Lyceum. Failed as Landry in “Fan-
chon.” Did well as Jingle in “Pickwick.” Then
his memorable hit in “The Bells,” 1871. Thence-
forward plain sailing. “The Bells,” 150 nights;
“Charles the First,” 120; “Richelieu,” 80. Also
performed “Eugene Aram” before his Hamlet triumph
of 200 nights. His management, with Ellen Terry
engaged, began 1878. Chief productions: “Hamlet,”
“Othello” (with Booth), “Merchant of Venice,”
“Much Ado About Nothing,” “Faust,” (most suc-
cessful of all), “Romeo and Juliet,” “Twelfth
Night,” “Macbeth,” “Richard III.,” “King Lear,”
“Henry VIII.,” “Becket,” “Cymbeline,” “Corio-
lanus.”
“L.H.P.”: “Hamlet” as an opera seems absurd, but
Ambroise Thomas, whose “Mignon” is well known to
Australians, furnished one which was produced in
Paris in 1868. Barbier and Carre, the librettists,
had but one object—to make Ophelia the heroine.
Thomas also wished to provide a role for Christine
Nilsson, then the idol of Paris. With the aid of
some charming Scandinavian melodies, he fitted
Nilsson with a character in which she was exquisite.
The following year saw the production of the
piece at Covent Garden with the original
Ophelia, and Santley as the Dane. In the
Covent Garden season of 1890, our own
Madame Melba appeared as Ophelia to the Hamlet
of Lassalle. Of later years, a tenor, Declery, has
been seen as the operatic Hamlet. Like the knighted
Tree, he makes the Dane wear a beard. Dramati-
cally speaking, the opera is no doubt full of
“bloomers,” the burlesque play scene and the Spring
ballet suggesting nothing but a grotesque travesty
of the tragic play. The German stage has a more
workmanlike edition of the opera in five acts.
“Polonius” : Irving’s “Hamlet” seems to me a very
fine performance; but why cut the play to pieces ? , and
probably other old-stagers, went to listen to the
music of the fine speeches, and found several of
them slaughtered. The king’s abortive prayer, which
gives the note of remorse to his villainy, and al-
most redeems the “lecherous, treacherous, remorseless,
kindless villain,” is cut away. Then the advice to
the players, which is strong evidence that Hamlet’s
madness was feigned, is knifed; while that beautiful
speech beginning—-
“Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man
As e’er my conversation cop’d withal,”
and containing the finest tribute to a friend ever
written, has been blue-pencilled. The lines—
“ Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath sealed thee for herself; for thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing; . . .
A man, that fortune’s buffets and rewards
Has ta’en with equal thanks” —
are worth a lot of the rest of the play. Part of the Grave-
diggers’ dialogue was cut, too. If I went to “Faust”
and found the “Salve Dimora,” the “Jewel Song”
and the “Soldiers’ Chorus” cut, or heard “Carmen”
without the “Toreador” and the “Flower” songs, or
went to “Tannhauser” and discovered that the
“Venusburg” music was left out, I should feel as
indignant as I was when I felt the gaps in this
“Hamlet.”
“Spotlight”: One thing I think should be pointed
out regarding The Bulletin’s criticism of H. B.
Irving’s “Hamlet.” The critic treats it as a replica
of Sir Henry Irving’s performance. I have H. B.’s
assurance that he never saw his father in the part;
consequently it is an achievement on his own basis.
The personal likeness of father and son is, of course,
striking, and heredity has gone farther: there is the
same “feeling” towards the part. But where the
elder Irving was difficult to follow, by reason of his
methods being obscure, H. B. has the educated intel-
ligence to make his meaning hit the audience the
whole time. An English critic summed up Sir Henry
absolutely on this point. “In his creations,” he
wrote, “there was always something esoteric and
essential, which eluded and defied analysis; he sur-
prised and captured strange beauties; within him
there was always sequestered and withdrawn an
idiosyncratic and inscrutable soul which flowered
into fantastic and gargoylish tricks of speech and
looks and gesture, but never expressed the whole of
its intention.” H. B. Irving’s acting is from with-
out, inwards; Sir Henry worked from inward, with-
out. There is in H. B. Irving’s reading “a burning
lucidity” ; his Hamlet is wary and purposeful. His
soliloquies are remarkable ; he makes “Hamlet” think
aloud.
When H. B. Irving told a send-off supper party that
he and his brother had often wished they were related
to Ethel Irving, he might just as well have deplored
his bad luck in not having Washington Irving for a
deceased uncle. H. B.’s name is actually Brodribb
by birth registration, as his father’s was. But Ethel
Irving acts under the name she was born to, and
now that she has made it a big one, her theatrical
namesakes stand rather in the light of her reputation.
Probably she wishes the famous Henry Irving and
his sons had gone into the “profesh” under the name
they were born to.
“Blue Mask”: It will probably be found true that
H. B. Irving, like his father, is the servant of his
own personality, and cannot make it properly nt any
but histrionic affinities. The man whose mind natur-
ally turns to the sinister side of study, as shown in
his “Life of Judge Jeffreys,” and “French Criminals
of the Nineteenth Century,” will not _ catch on to
comedy and romantic drama as he will to tragedy.
For myself I’d like to see him play Bill Sikes, the
character of which his father made so terrible and
ferocious a picture; but I suppose it is impossible.
Actor “Jimmy” Atholwood has rearranged “Ham-
let” so as to make a connected story with a suc-
cession of tableaux. He has added nothing, but has
re-arranged and dovetailed scenes, cutting out lines,
or transposing them to suit his plan. James _B. is
confident the public will like Shakswood far better
than it ever liked Shakspeare—if it ever gets a
chance of judging.
The stage-struck sisterhood of “Melbourne Gal-
lery Girls” seems to have saved up a burst of adula-
tion for Ethel Irving, judging from the fact that an
M.G.G. “deputation” presented her with a bouquet
as soon as she arrived. Mummer-worship had
slackened in Melbourne after the Asches were dis-
posed of, and the fanatics were feeling the want of
a new idol when Miss Irving came to hand.
From London: Laurence Irving’s dramatised ver-
sion of the story of Margaret Catchpole, at London
Duke of York’s, has been rather roughly handled by
the critics. It is too crudely melodramatic and old-
fashioned for their tastes. Irving plays the villain
with what the Times critic calls “hereditary snarls
and grunts,” a not very polite allusion to some of his
famous father’s mannerisms. His wife (Mabel Hack-
ing) impersonates Madcap Peggy; but whether it is
really she or a double that shins up the 40ft. wall of
Ipswich Gaol, while her lover or another double is
playing the fiddle on the other side, is a point on
which opinions differ. The probabilities are in favor
of a masculine double. Peggy’s famous ride from
Ipswich to London is shown on a cinematograph
screen. A naval spectacle of the Nelson era is intro-
duced ; also a troupe of dancers, who enliven the
piece and get most of the praise. The Australian
scenery in the last act is voted good by Australians
—and they ought to know best.
Ramaciotti rounded off his highly profitable con-
nection with J. O. Williamson, Ltd., by buying for
£25,000 the freehold of one of the J.O.W. theatres
—the Sydney Royal—along with the inevitable pub
and the accessories. It looks dirt cheap; yet on
June 26, 1861, Fitzgerald (with whose trustees the
deal was made) bought the lot, including the ruins
of the recently-burned Prince of Wales Theatre,
which stood on the site, for £3250.
Touching Melba’s first re-appearance at Oovent
Garden this season, in “La Bohfeme,” London
Referee said: “Mimi is merely a simple-minded
workgirl, with a tender heart and jealous tempera-
ment ; but it is probable that Melba has done more
to increase her popularity as an artist by the per-
sistency with which she has embodied the character
than by the brilliancy of her singing in other roles.. .
She sang with fascinating purity of tone and ex-
quisite finish, and also acted with a simple direct-
ness and earnestness in the third and fourth acts that
intensified the pathos of the scenes.” Who was it
said that Melba had no “soul”? After witnessing
her emotional acting in “La Traviata,” Hugh Ward
protested years ago that she was the best Camille
he had seen, bar Sarah Bernhardt.
“O’Kasion”: A few days ago Conway Wingfield
sailed from Sydney for New York. He has been
many things in his time. In Fleet-street he was on
the staff of a religious weekly, after turning his back
on the allurements of a Nonconformist pastorate.
Then he did a lot of acting in England and South
Africa before he tired of it about six years ago, and
came to Australia to try dairy-farming. Tiring also
of the cow, he joined Meynell and Gunn to produce
a pretty bad failure, “The Rake’s Wife.” He was
responsible for an excellent Irish musician in that
lurid horror, "A Warning to Women,” which Maud
Hilyard perpetrated; and he showed to advantage
as the cheated American lover in “Jim the Pen-
man,” when Meynell and Gunn revived it, with
Madge Mclntosh and Beatty. When Nellie Stewart
did “Sweet Kitty Bellairs,” a couple of years ago,
Wingfield got a good chance as Captain O’Hara, and
in Brisbane he went on at a few hours’ notice to
play the King in “Sweet Nell.” But, generally,
Wingfield was better than the work he found to do
here, and it shouldn’t be hard for him to strike
better luck somewhere else.
Hobart’s ancient Theatre Royal, long the only
“shop” in the sleepy old village, has had its heels
so trodden on by a couple •of new-comers that its
owners have handed it over for renovation and ex-
tension to the tune of some £3OOO or £4OOO.
In a recent London revival of “Arms and the
Man,” Mrs. Petkoff was played by Geraldine Olliffe,
one-time of the Brough-Boucicault Co., who should
fit the part even better than Susie Vaughan does.
“Bookware”: Ben Jonson’s masque, “The Vision of
Delight,” was introduced in the Coronation gala per-
formance at Tree’s Theatre, in order to cram in all
the most beautiful women on the London stage. The
masque opens with something like the transformation
scene in a Christmas pantomime—a bevy of classical
dames, suggestive of Venuses, but here described as
Grace, Love, Harmony, Revel, Sport, Laughter and
the like. Wonder gazes on them, and delivers a
swathe of poetry. Mrs. Langtry is mentioned first
in the cable, so perhaps she took this part. A Sea
Monster is delivered of six Harlequins and six Colum-
bines. (Dancing here.) Then Night appears in her
chariot, bespangled with stars. She speaks a piece.
Fantasy appears from the clouds, and has a turn.
(More dancing.) The Hours all pass by. Next is
the Bower of Zephyrs, with elocution by Peace. Ar-
rive the Glories of Spring. (Singing here.) The
whole winds up with the appearance of Aurora in her
car. All the language is in the exuberant classic
vein in which Jonson was inimitable.
“Schupin”: The easy, casual way in which pianist
Leonard Borwick grips his audience reminds Mel-
bourne’s older stagers of one Friedenthal, a German
pianist of the sweet and gentle school, who used to
give recitals in the Athenaeum Hall. Borwick is a
finer executant than Friedenthal was, but not more
likeable. For a pianist of his type the Melbourne
Town Hall seems absurdly big, ugly and unsociable.
His warmest admirers are the people who don’t sit
at the far end of the building, whereas a Mark I-lam-
bourg punches the keyboard with special designs on
the way-back portion of his audience. The same
instrument serves a double purpose. A piano player
delights; a forte player excites.
“Star”: A profusely be-whiskered person, in big
boots, loomed before the circle doorkeeper in a
metropolitan theatre one evening recently. He was
backed by a portly wife, and behind her was a string
of three —two freckled daughters and a very large
son of 13, jutting out of a very small, tight suit.
The man with the whiskers wanted to get in “on the
gun,” and the noise he made when the check-taker
raised technicalities disturbed the whole audience, and
threw the players out of step. The man said he would
go in, his wife seconded the motibn and the children
supported it. The representative in front was has-
tily summoned to quell the insurrection, and for his
enlightenment the visitor from Tinbilly produced
an ancient document which proved to be an unre-
ceipted bill for three weeks’ board against the gifted
“sole lessee and manager.” The bill was 17 years
old. The holder was going to “take it out,” he
said. Although far beyond the statute of limitations,
the bill (a relic of unhappier days) was honorably
met.
A gruesome playlet, with a earning moral, was
produced in Paris lately. A young actress is pho-
tographed on her death-bed by her husband, after the
doctor, hurriedly called in, has given a certificate of
death. When the photo, is developed the eyes of
the “deceased” are seen to be wide open. There-
upon the coffin, now two days buried, is dug up and
opened. The corpse is found to have broken a blood-
vessel in screaming, presumably to make herself
heard! Moral: Never get buried until your post-
mortem photo, has been developed.
THE LEGS OF MARY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some poets sing of arms that cling,
And hair black, brown or brindle;
For Cis and Kate still celebrate
The old, time-honored swindle;
With hair that’s dyed, and teeth supplied
Per dentist-cove, they amble;
They play their cards with simple bards
Who always lose the gamble.
False teeth deceive, and man may grieve
That form and tint should vary;
I rise just here to hymn with cheer
The lovely legs of Mary!
Let Jess and Sue have eyes of blue,
Let Jane have lips of coral;
Spring poets all are free to squall—-
With these I shall not quarrel!
I do not care whence Celia’s hair
Is bought or lent or rented;
And Julia’s chest may stand the test
Or not—I’m quite contented !
I simply beg to state that leg,
When false, deceiveth nary;
And oh! I do admire the two
Most scrumptious legs of Mary!
In Mary’s praise this psalm I’d raise
With fervor truly loyal;
No falsehood here, so let us cheer—
I know her legs are royal;
We know that Eve doth oft deceive,
She’s full of tricks and cunning;
The leg that’s false, it cannot waltz—
It’s also poor for running!
But Mary mine, she’s superfine—-
Ah, she’s no sylph-like fairy;
A bouncing miss, who’s good to kiss,
God save the legs of Mary!
VICTORIA.

A GENUINE HAIRGROWER.
We have received the following recipe from
a correspondent who has found it to be of
great value. Our correspondent says that
this mixture is a hair tonic which, if rubbed
briskly into the scalp night and morning with
the finger tips, will not fail to promote the
growth of hair, to remedy baldness, to re-
store grey hair to its natural color, and to
destroy dandruff.
Take | dram of Menthol Crystals and put
them into a bottle containing 3oz. of Bay
Rum and see that they are entirely dis-
solved, then add loz. of Lavona de Compos6e,
and if desired one teaspoonful of To-lvalon
perfume. Shake well and let it stand for
half an hour, when it will be ready for use.
Other readers will doubtless be glad to try
this I’emedy which our correspondent _ has
sent. We understand that the ingredients
may be obtained from any chemist.
CAUTION.—As this is doubtless a re-
markable hair grower, it should be applied
only, where hair is desired.*

THE DOCTOR : "He has developed unfavorabe

THE WIFE : “ I knew it! He tried to get up
to go to work—a thing he’s never done

The case of Polley, whom a Melbourne
jury recently acquitted on a charge of shoot-
ing one of B. Smith’s colored Mends at
Warburton (Vic.), let loose a small pre-
cedent that ought to grow into a fine large
animal. When Justice a’Beckett arrived
in court he found all the paraphernalia pre-
sent except the accused’s counsel, and he
declined to empanel the jury until Horse-
whiskers turned up. When he did turn up
Justice a’Beckett smote him with a fine of
£5 for “contempt” in that he had kept the
whole legal outfit waiting. Maybe the pre-
cedent —that the learned person in horsehair
can’t dodge his hired service any more than
can the illiterate person in moleskin —will
grow, and then the learned spieler who ac-
cepts fees for cases in which he never ap-
pears (being “engaged in another court, y’r
Honor”) will become less frequent than he
is now.
“Adelaide”: So tramcars in Sydney have
open doors facing the other line, and people
riding on the inside footboards cannon into
and kill each other (B. 22/6/’ll) ! And
“if the footboards were hinged the one on
the closed side could be put out of action” !
They could, and they are —in Adelaide. In
fact, as I have often said about so many
other things (land tax, absentee tax, absence
of slums, prevention of expectoration, street-
cleaning, totalisators, and good Australian
fruit-vendors are some of them), send over
to so-called sleepy Adelaide if you want to
see how tilings can be done. You can t get
out of a car on the wrong or dangerous
side in this State; even the old liorse-cars
saw to that. Well, you can; but it means
ducking under a bar and then getting down
without a step. I have done it to
save trouble in a croivded car. The first
time, a passing bobby told me earnestly
what would happen if I did it again. Ihe
second time, the driver was down as soon as
I was, took me by the collar, and firmly
helped me back by the unlawful way 1 had
come. There has not been any third time.
Mount Donna Buang, 40S9ft. high, is a
new beauty resort now being opened by
the Victorian Government. It is 48 miles
from Melbourne, and at present wears a
thick cap of snow. Last week a Ministerial
party went thither, accompanied by 150
non-official picnickers. Acting-Minister for
Works Edgar was in the lead, and,
at a little gathering after the journey, some-
one with no sense of poetry or humor sug-
gested that the name should be changed to
“Mount Edgar.” This suggestion was agreed
to by the crowd, and is to be submitted to
the Lands Department. If the Lands De-
partment has any sense of the fitness or
things it will kick the idea so hard
that it won’t be seen again. “Donna” is a
name that has been given by the blacks to a
number of Gippsland streams and moun-
tains. Old aborigines say it means “a big
woman.” The theory of experts is that the
name got into the language of the blacks a
century or two ago, when Spaniards visited
the South Gippsland coast, where some ot
them were shipwrecked. The words “donna
and “Madonna” were frequently on the lips
of these pious freebooters, and probably
were among the little things thev left be-
hind them. Anyhow, “Donna Buang” seems
to mean “Lady of the Waters,” or “Queen ot
the Waters,” and is interesting if only oil
account of its supposed origin, whereas Ed-
gar” stands merely for the Wowsensm o.:
the soon-to-be-forgotten Weary-Willie Gov-
ernment.
From Basil Lubbock, Par, Cornwall
(Eng.) :
Recent Bulletin para-
graphs dealing with
quick trips by old-time
wind - jammers have
made me glad. Among
them (B. 23/3/’ll) I
was struck with the al-
leged 51 days of_ the
Elizabeth A. Bright,
Liverpool to Hobson’s
Bay, in 1860. Is there
proof of that ? I am
writing a history 'of
the sailing - ship re-
cords of the nine-
teenth century, and
can only find that the
Elizabeth Ann took 76
days in 1860.
As I hope to deal
very thoroughly with
the Australian clip-
pers, I should be ex-
tremely grateful for
any information on
the subject, or remin-
iscences from old sail-
ors in Australia, who
may be glad to know
that I am writing the
book for sailors and
from a sailor’s point
of view, and without
anv expectation or hope of profit.

“Gwy”: “Hamer” and “Pera” needn’t
wrangle over whether the station book-keep-
er’s hard case should go to a Wages Board
or not: it has already got there. One of
this underpaid individual’s manifold activi-
ties lies in the station “store.” A Wages
Board is on the eve of pronouncing an
award for country shop assistants ; but be-
fore the chairman closed his notebook the
storekeeping employers reminded him that
some of the stations, not content to
merely supply permanent hands and shear-
ers. also served the sparse population of the
locality as well. The emp'overs reckoned it
wasn’t a fair thing that the squatters
should sell goods to all and sundry in compe-
tition with regular storekeepers who might
have to pay a minimum wage of 505., per-
haps more. And the union hacked them up.
Inasmuch, however, as the station book-
keeper-CKm-tutor-CMm-storekeeper might die
of shock if he were handed a weekly 505., the
big pastoral cos. will, from humane motives,
agree to restrict their retailing of plum jam
and plug tobacco to constant hands, pro-
vided they are exempted from the award.
At least that is what the barrister they
rushed along to the Board suggested.
OLD SAWS RESET.
“What’s the matter, Eva?"
“No fury like a woman's corns.”
“Akenehi” fires at a 5000-mile range:—
I wish you would hurry up the Transcontinental
Railway. Letters I posted at Port Darwin on April
26, for Sydney, cannot leave there until May 8. We
are now within 12 blistering hours of Manilla, and
our captain and hope tell a flattering tale that the
steamer Empire will pass us on her way south this
afternoon, and that she may stop and add these re-
marks to her ballast. It is for her the letters wait
at Port Darwin. For her and the Bth of May, and
your winter will be almost at its noon when they
reach Sydney!
Brisbane, Rockhampton, Thursday Island and
Cairns left me clammy and unimpressed, but
Darwin dried me, exhilarated, and impressed me
as (in spots) the most beautiful place I have seen
since Java. It was hot, but with the heat with which
I should imagine Hichens fires his Egyptian stories.
A clear, windless, amber heat, and pungent with the
scent of some fragrant weed. A heat that makes you
feel you have wings, not leaden pellets, on your
shoes. You recall Shelley’s phrase, the “painted air,”
in “The Sensitive Plant?” Well, Darwin is the
first clime I have come to in which the air has the
suggestion of being painted.
In the garden of the Residency, giant seed-pods
falling from their stems felt hard and hot as warmed
gun-metal, and the bursting of pods that had not
fallen were as the reports of fairy artillery. The
only sounds they were that broke the windless silence.
Our hosts were the Resident (Mr. Justice Mitchell)
and Miss Mitchell, and our fellow guests the Bishop
of Carpentaria (Gilbert White) and his sister. That
I should live to chronicle a Chinaman “amongst
those present.” Chickweed (the nearest I can get
to his name) has been at the Residency through
three or four Administrations, and. is a Chinese Cap-
tain Wallington, though he is head only of the domes-
tic staff. His manner of standing before the guests
he has just served with tea and squashes, and ex-
plaining the flora in the big, dim rooms, and the
agreeable coolness now apparent in the night-air, has
a quite royal aloofness and condescension.
The beauty drive of Darwin is through the Botanic
Gardens to East Point. Mr. N. Holtze, who is Cura-
tor of the Gardens, as well as Government Secretary
and Sheriff, and a few etceteras., was our driver. A
gang of native prisoners, working between the glit-
tering sea on our left and a wall of tropical vegeta-
tion on our right, was chaperoned by a bulky white
in khaki, shading himself with a big umbrella.
“Pardon me,” said the lesser authority , to the higher
as he stepped forward, raising his hand and lowering
his sunshade, “but four of my ‘boys’ have bolted into
that.” He indicated the towering wall of jungle that
looked bolt-proof except to a snake or a lizard.
“Who are they?” asked the higher authority.
“Nipper and Wally and Nickie and Towie. All
short-sentence chaps, too,” he added, in an injured
tone.
“Oh, well, take your men back and get out the
trackers,” and on dashed our ponies, and the Sheriff
was again the Curator, pointing out the numerous
fibre plants that will be such additions to the resources
of this great country. On our way back we met a
mounted constable going out to the scene of the van-
ishing trick. A handsome youngster, lean and long,
cold of eye, fine of jaw, thin of lip. And riding like
—like an Australian.
You can touch almost any Victorian Judge
in a sore place now, for the whole tribe of
them is said to be riled because Brown, the
Attorney-General, who of recent years prac-
tised mine-management, but never law, has
“reviewed” so many sentences. In private
places the Judge will tell you that he doesn’t
object to appeals—though the Appeal Court
is ’ generally wrong, of course, if it upends
the thing. What he does object to is that so
many fellows should stay in gaol because
they haven’t got influential friends to go
worrying an Attorney-General to let them
out. That is the curse of a system that
doesn’t include a criminal court of appeal :
it takes influence to start the semi-political
Attorney-General machinery. And then, as
likely as not, the machinery has not been
tested, and can’t do its work properly.
“The Religious Editor” : Last week Mel-
bourne and Auckland simultaneously dis-
covered that the kitchens of some of their
public fooderies were places to shudder over.
Melbourne has not yet plugged its nostrils
and investigated fully; Auckland, _on the
contrary, has ; through its chief sanitary in-
spector, a fair idea of the awfulness which
may lie behind the polite waiter. There will
probably be a boom in lunch-baskets when
the news gets round. Years ago I worked next
to a Melbourne oyster saloon. In front it was
polished cedar, marble, nickelplate and
rose-tinted electric lights; behind, there was
little else but dust, sodden bags, putrid
oysters, rats and manure. The cook smoked
continuously, and looked as if he had given
up washing in early youth; his assistant
looked as if he had never washed in his life.
The yard smelt to Heaven and all the inter-
vening planets; but the boss didn’t worry
about it so long as it didn’t smell to the cus-
tomers. Now and then, when there had been
too many deaths in the oyster family, we
used to ring up the Nuisance Inspector and
draw his nose to the scene. He never seemed
to be able to discover the outrages for him-
self. Possibly his nose had been rendered
smell-blind through overwork. Some day
the restaurant proprietor who neglects to in-
vite his patrons to inspect his cook and his
kitchen will be suspected and avoided like the
man who refuses to allow an intending pur-
chaser to examine his books.

Interesting extract from the report of the
Kalgoorlie (W.A.) health inspector on a
local Jap laundry: “The bedroom, kitchen
and laundry are combined, and there is no
closet.” And the Society maidens and the
Society mannikins hug to their bosoms the
linen laundered in a hovel which is bedroom,
kitchen and laundry—and other things—
combined, and “sprinkled” probably with
water squirted through the nice heathen's
teeth.
“Vagabond”: Apropos the struggle, most
marked in South Australia, to get the
rifles, etc., that were taken from the Boers
exhibited in pride and in public places.
Were you ever at Teneriffe? If you were
you probably felt for a few minutes like the
Boer must feel when we throw these things
in his face. Hanging on the walls of the
cathedral there is a British flag which the
Dagoes collared at the time Nelson paid
them a call, and found them very much at
home —so much so that he had to
hustle back to the boats, and be thankful for
small mercies when he got there. The Span-
ish guide who shows the visitors round
never fails to point out this interesting
relic, and he usually adds that if Nelson
had been a real gent, and done the square
thing, he would have sent them the empty
sleeve he had no use for afterwards, just to
hang up alongside as a climax to the story.
You’ll usually hear some humiliated Brit,
trying to explain to the guide that this was
the only defeat that Nelson ever, ever, ever
had to swallow; but the guide only smiles,
and remarks that he never heard what Nel-
son did in other places.
IN 1915?
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The ancient painter painted up the road a yard or
two,
And painted down again, a lovely, pale, transparent
blue;
And as he painted, slowly, with a calculating eye,
Towards his victim stealthily the canvasser drew
nigh.
“Goo’ morn’,” the canvasser remarked, and “Morn’ ”
the old man said —
And painted up a yard or two towards the buggy-
shed,
And painted back again, the while the canvasser dis-
played
A wealth of tailor-patterns, and persuaded him to
trade.
The township slumbered; slowly did the old man
wipe his fist
Upon his apron; slowly then the patterns did he
twist
And turn and thumb, and stared at them, it seemed
regretfully.
“We tailor cheap,” the traveller said —-“with extra
trousers free !”
“Well, / dunno!” The painter heaved a sigh and
took his brush
And painted on. The canvasser, with language on
the rush,
Did everything to snare his prey an honest man could
do —-
And still the painter painted yards of pale, trans-
parent blue.
“The fact is—no!” the old man said, and painted
up and down,
And once more wiped his hands, and took the pat-
terns, with a frown.
A shade of sadness dwelt awhile upon his counten-
ance,
As though some old-time might-have-been he pon-
dered. Then —“No chance,”
He muttered ; “no, it ain’t no good yer talkin’,” —
and began
Once more to streak pale paint. “Y’ see, I ain’t a
married man!”

A piece about the “grasping” grafter—
And, as at some new, splendid joke,
The crowd broke forth in roars of laughter.
“I do believe,” he beat the air,
And cackled, for “fair play” appealing—
“That most Australians, everywhere,
Are gentlemen ! ” He spoke with feeling.
“You’re wrong!” a voice derisive rose,
The while the audience laughed like Hades —
“Why, Kink O’Malley’s census shows
That more’n half of ’em are ladies!”

June’s expiring kick in Sydney took the
form of a record fog on the Harbor, with
disastrous results to traffic. Two of the
ferry steamers had a head-on collision, while
a Manly steamer butted into a collier which
had thoughtfully anchored in the fairway.
A third accident helped to show that the
over-the-harbor resident gambles when he
sallies forth on a foggy morning. A Bal-
main ferry steamer was nosing her way
along, when suddenly a steam lighter with a
punt alongside loomed out of the fog. Both
craft went full speed astern, but couldn’t get
clear. The iron bow end of the punt struck
the ferry steamer on the quarter, jumped the
protecting sponson and caught the flimsy
ladies’ cabin —fortunately empty. The wood-
work and glass collapsed like cardboard, and
the side of the structure was demolished.
Unfortunately for the Evening Blood-
stain, the Lady Rawson was bound from Syd-
ney to Balmain. Had she been en route to
the metropolis with a load of city workers,
there must have been a tale to tell Of a
catastrophe more horrible than that of Rich-
mond. The incident should be a solemn
warning to the Harbor Trust. It is, of
course, impossible to build the superstruc-
ture of a ferry boat so that it won’t be
affected when it crashes into an iron punt.
Therefore to protect the ferry steamers,
there should be special fog traffic-regula-
tions, one of which would prohibit the cross-
ing of ferry routes by punts, barges, light-
ers, etc.
At Mount Mary (S.A.), the other day, a
married couple drove off after the wedding
with the object of striding the nearest town ;
but they lost their way, and wandered
round in the scrub all night. In honor of
their introduction to married life, they in-
tend to christen their eldest son Mallee.

The crowning of George recalls that im-
mediately after he had finished the corona-
tion of Edward, the old Archbish. of Can-
terbury fell to the floor unconscious. He
may have been overheated by the “fierce
light that beats upon a throne” ; or it may
have been the unaccustomed congregation
after being used to addressing two or three
reluctant sleepers; or, again, it may have
been simply horror on reflecting that the
alleged church of Christ has just been con-
verted into a temple for the performance of
pagan rites.

Reading of the kisses that were show-
ered upon His Gracious apropos of the Cor-
onation, one is reminded of the Adelaide
alderman who insisted on kissing George’s
hand when he held a reception, as Duke of
York, in the Holy City. George was giving
the levee his royal forefinger to shake, but
the civic father couldn’t content himself
with that. He grasped the hand and bent
reverently towards it. The Duke tried to
free himself, and blushed like a lobster —he
was the reddest Heir Apparent in Christen-
dom. But the bending alderman, without
raising his eyes to the royal countenance,
hung on to the royal hand until he had
smacked it with his lips. After which he
slowly retired backwards, feeling every inch
a courtier. In revenge, they made him —a

“Button-stick” on this dreadful business
of the kilts -
I’ve gone digging after the “facts” referred
to by “Blanco” (B. 29/6/’ll) re the kilts in
S’Africa, and I’ve dug till my spade is blunted and
I’ve got corns on my hands. Now I’ll mark-time
while “Blanco” has a turn at the implement. Will
he tell us what regiments of the Highland Brigade
were put into breeks early in 1900, and kept there
till the big scrapping was done? The kilts were
worn at Paardebcrg, and so were the khaki aprons
which “Blanco” says the Highlanders got on being
put back into their
kilts when “the
big fighting was
done.” I dunno
what the Scots
wore during the
army’s rest be-
tween rounds
( March - April ),
but I do know
that from then on
the kilts never left
them. Perhaps
“Blanco” will Toll
up some of the
facts I “conven-
ien 11 y overlook-
ed,” and give us
the regiments that
foreswore the kilts,
and the dates. I’m
wondering if he’s
mixing up the
Highland Brigade
and the Highland
Light Infantry, a
regiment which
doesn’t and didn’t
wear kilts. I was
only too familiar
with the “grey-
backs,” and there
is only one breeding place I can imagine more fav-
orable to them than the waist of the kilt —and that
is the, seams of trousers !
“Kaitangata”: All over America, as well
as in other countries, the use of stone and
steel for important buildings is nowadays
almost universal. In San Francisco tower-
ing edifices of these materials stood not
only the fire, but the earthquake itself. Here
in Sydney the building that it is most import-
ant should be fireproof, the Registrar-Gen-
eral’s offices, is so filled with timber inter-
nally as to make the new and handsome-
looking pile, on its lofty site, suitable for a
stupendous bonfire, especially as the slates
are laid on a network of “kindling” in the
form of narrow rafters. Why, Macquarie,
a century ago, builded with more foresight!
“Chasuble”: Archbishop Clarke,
of Melbourne, has another rose-thorn
in his softest flesh. Ridley College,
established near the Uni., pushes
ahead ; while Trinity stagnates. The
latter —High Church, was amazingly
successful in its early years, turning
out Bishop Stretch, of Newcastle;
Bishop Green, of Ballarat; Bishop
Armstrong, of Wangaratta: Dean
Stephen, of Melbourne; and Vicar
Hughes, of St. Peter’s, Melbourne.
Since then it has gone right off,
though it remains under the same
admirable Dr. Deeper. The trouble
is there is no straw for the bricks.
Ridley Colleee is Evangelical, ar-
dently supported by Bishop Langley,
of Bendigo (formerly of Sydney) ;
Bishop Pain, of Gippsland (also for-
merly of N.S.W.) ; and Archdeacon
Nash, of Gippslend. Rich w rt men
have been pouring money into it, and
now it goes in for an expensive
building.

Most people will remember the
steamer Papanui, and the fuss that
was made when her owners kicked
at paying the price of her repairs in
Australia, and quietly slid her off
to sea in spite of official objections.
They preferred to chance her bust
and battered carcase to the mercy of
the ocean between here and Japan,
where they could get the repairs done
cheap. Her luck held her up, and
she made her port all right, and was
repaired and put into service again.
But the chean Jap. repairs are al-
ready hinting that they may be nas!y
as well as cheap, for the vessel is
reported to have staggered into
Perim, in the Red Sea, in a leaking
condition. It may be only a slight leak, of
course ; but, again, it may be that her engi-
neers and officers are sleeping with the life-
belts handy and the boats kept in a state of
unusual readiness for a prompt exit. Ban-
zai !
A Melbourne Society lady,
once an actress, who pos-
sesses a Past, was being
fitted at the milliner’s. The
gear was poised upon her
head, and the milliner step-
ped back to admire it.
“Beautiful,” she murmured
ecstatically. “Perhaps it
is,” said the owner of the
Past. “But a don’t care a
(naughty word) about the
front. They all wait till I
get past, and then turn and
stare. So fix me up beauti-
ful at the back.’
The pumpkin country showed its undying-
loyalty in its own fashion. Taree, one of
the N.S.W. North Coast towns, broke out
into a queer mixture of “religious” demon-
stration, procession and sports. The lead
was taken by an individual, who repre-
sented Mephistopheles, with crimson robes,
cloven feet and horns, and a toasting-fork
for a sceptre. Other characters “much ap-
preciated” were bridal couples, the brides
wearing harem skirts, and carrying bouquets
of cabbage leaves. Taree was giddily ex-
cited over this outburst of loyal and reli-
gious fervor; the only wet blanket was the
Salv’army captain, who called out his “sol-
diers,” and declined to follow “the Devil”
under anv circumstances. It was a quaint
way of celebrating the crowning of a mon-
arch, however you look at it; and the only
reasonable excuse offered to date is that the
proceedings were no more futile than those
which occurred at Westminster.
The demand for another residence for
Victoria’s sub-Excellency seems in no im-
mediate danger of being satisfied. Several
houses have been considered; but, though
they are sufficiently commodious, they are
not charming enough in other respects. Some
are too far from Melbourne; some have too
little “grounds”; others are deficient in
“style.” So the Government will have to
hunt further. Probably it now occurs to
the Government that, when it already pos-
sessed a mansion, it should have found a
Governor to suit the dwelling. That looks
like the most reasonable procedure when
the Excellency really doesn’t matter.
Rapturous cable to S. M. Plerald about
the Coronation: —
Fires everywhere fringed the coast, and there were
86 great beacon fires blazing on the shore of Cavan
County, in Ireland, alone.
And doubtless the battle-fleet of Switzer-
land stood off and viewed the glorious scene
on the matchless shores of Cavan. At
least it would have happened so if Switzer-
land had a fleet or Cavan a coast.
“Boswell”: Though in the case alluded to
in B. 8/6/T1 the money-lender lost both
principal and interest because he had neg-
lected his triennial registration under the
N.S.W. law, there need be no commotion
among the casual sharks that haunt public
offices and other places, and oblige hard-ups
with a “tenner” at 120 per cent, or so. The
Act of 1905 defines a “moneylender” :
The expression “moneylender” in this Act shall in-
clude every person or company whose business is
that of moneylending, or who advertises or announces
himself, or holds himself out in any way as carrying
on that business, but shall not include (a) .. . (b)
. . . (c) . . . (d) any person or company bona fide
carrying on the business of banking or insurance, or
bona fide carrying on any business no t having for its
'primary object the lending of money in the course of
which and for the purpose whereof money is lent.
Thus it points the loaded barrel straight at
the professional, but doesn’t even reserve a
blank cartridge for the casual or amateur
shark.
CONCEALED IMPUDENCE.
NEWSBOY: “So long.”
The S. M. Herald, speaking about Coron-
ation “honors,” quite forgot what it is there
for: —
There may be instances where a title is meaning-
less ; where it has been bestowed upon a person
merely because he achieved an office, and managed
to hang on for several terms.
Yah, Pro-Boer ! Disloyalist! But what
sort of an “honor” does the Herald think a
title is when it can ever be handed out in
the way the Herald mentions?
IN MELLOW MOOD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In mellow mood of morning-tide
I sang her eyes of blue;
And found, as on 1 versified,
She poetastered too.
While I her azure orbs would hymn,
She trilled of eyes of brown;
And when I praised her ankles trim
Or gushed about her gown,
She lilted then of symmetry,
Of wealth of glossy hair,
Of step as light as step could be,
Of beauty lithe and fair.
I warbled then of constancy,
Of hearts both leal and true;
And, strange to say, my lovely She’
That theme was singing, too.
And as I ran, in frenzy fine,
Her charms enumerating,
I found the Sweet Thing Feminine
My verse was emulating.
Our rhyming tasks at last complete,
With all their sweet allusion,
We read in turn —as was but meet—
But, Oil I to my confusion,
I found while I in tuneful maze
Had sung her like a noodle,
In just my turn of word and phrase
She’d gushed about her poodle.

Extract of a letter from
the late Manager, “ Motor
Transit Company of Aus-
tralia,’’Glen Innes: “ During
the time I was managing
‘The Motor Transit Co. of
Australia,’ we had plying , , . , , , , ,
between Glen Innes and Inverell an 11-16 Clement-Bayard Oar, which we purchased as second-hand. We
did about 60,000 miles with her up to the time of my leaving (she is still going well). Nearly all the running
was done between Glen Innes and Inverell, over the famous Waterloo Range, some of the grades of which
are one in six. The Car was invariably overloaded, and was given very little care ; but in the face of the bad
usage she received at our hands she stood up wonderfully well, and the only repairs that were effected were
two ball races for road wheels and a set of new valves.” . , , .
Call and allow us to explain the reason why our prices for Cars generally, Commercial Lorries and High-
wheel Buggies will be found to be 25 per cent, lower than the usual Sydney quotations.

“Geofred”: The evidence recently given
in the Federal Arbitration Court as to one shearer
impersonating another by arrangement for pecuniary
benefit or convenience, reminds me of Jones, who
made it worth Smith’s while to hand him his name
arid Contract to shear at Ruthen (Q.). There was a
new boss, and all went well with Jones, alias Smith,
until black sister Maggie visited the shed. Hearing
Jones addressed as Smith, she chipped in, “That
pfoiler not Smith!” The ensuing argument con-
cluded, for the time, by Jones declaring that “the
gin was off her rocker.” Next day, at s’moke-o,
Maggie turned up, nursing a half-caste boy, arid sat
down, grinning beside Jones. “ ’Ere,” said he,
wot’s your game? Git!” “Oh, I dunno,” replied
the lady, “last shearing time this piccaninny be-
longa Smith. You gib it the money, mine tink.”
That night Jones camped 10 miles from Ruthen.
HARD GRAFT.
CRUMMIE : “ Can yer give us somethin' ter eat, mum?"
HOUSEWIFE : “Yes, if you are prepared to do a bit of hard work."
CRUMMIE : “ Oh, I don't mind that, mum — I've got pretty good teeth."
“J.G.”: “Alba Stralia” (B. 15/6/’ll) is
quite right in saying that snakes won’t crawl over
bright white objects. That is, of course, if they are
dead snakes. The other sort will. One time, when
camped at Bungaree (Vic.), I merely laid my tent on
top of my doss to ward off the dew, as I was too
tired, or too lazy, or too something to fix up the
canvas. Towards morning I woke up with the feel-
ing that something was waltzing on top of the
clothes. On hastily striking a match I was para-
lysed to see a big black snake, which looked about
12 feet long, sitting up on top of my counterpane.
When I looked again, with the aid of a second
match, I saw that the big snake was really two.
The pair had evidently been canoodling on top of my
white covering.
“Ixion”: “Yalgun” (B- 22/6/T1), who
takes up the cudgels for the Cow Cocky, is a pur-
blind ass, and so, I suspect, were his ancestors for
about eight generations back. He says the average State
school-boy is seldom worth his breakfast. Wrong,
nearly every time! The Cow country boys may be
dull, but it is owing to Cow, and to nothing else;
and, as to their breakfast- —well, they often go with-
out it on account of the horned quadruped. With
regard to “Border View, K.C.” (B. 22/6/’ll), and
his remarks re the Cow Cocky’s regard for his
women folk, I knew a family in the Otway Forest
(Vic.) whose cows were milked by ma and the
girls, until one fine day pa bought some milking
machines. These acted splendidly, and pa and the
boys worked them for a while; but in a little time
the novelty wore off, and the men folk discovered
that milking was “too much fag,” whereupon they
hung up the machines for the moth and the rust to
corrupt, and once more ma and the girls do all the
milking and separating, without any help whatever
from the male portion of the family. Is this
“chivalry”—or simply cussed laziness?
* * * *
“The Snake”: The usually-gentle ex-
Speaker McCourt (N.S.W.) smote the Royal Agri-
cultural Society with ah axe the other evening over
a proposed grant of extra land. Contending that the
dairyman and the pastoralist did not receive one iota
of benefit from the Society’s exhibitions, he showed
that, out of a revenue of £24,000, the society spent
about £4500 altogether in prizes. McCourt’s idea
that the big Easter show is merely a sort of glorified
circus is open to long and unprofitable argument; but
he certainly makes out a case for giving greater en-
couragement to the not-so-fat country folk by reduc-
ing entrance fees and giving assistance in the costly
carriage of stock for exhibition. A wealthy body that
spends more than half the amount of its annual
Government subsidy in banquets and other gorges^ —
the cost of the annual election dinner is set down at
£lO3 —can afford to spread its bank balance a bit
for the further benefit of the real object of its
existence.
* * * *
“0.L.”: Perhaps I can give the reason
that “Gip” (B. 18/5/’ll) did not supply when she
remarked on the increasing quantity of Brer
Fox in the Monaro (N.S.W.). In my part of the
country (Limekilns) the increase is due to the
friendliness of some of the squattdrs. one who
permitted rabbit-trapping on his ground only on
condition that all foxes caught should be let go;
and he is not the only one who acts that way. The
argument of these short-sighted people is that the
fox is known to kill rabbits all the year round,
whereas there is no proof that he has ever killed a
sheep.
The most amazing epistle which the Vic-
torian Intelligence Bureau has yet received from any
of their assisted innocents came from one who de-
sired to know how he could obtain an injunction to
prevent a neighbor shooting rabbits upon his bit of
land!
* * * *
“Quan”: A cedar tree, estimated to con-
tain 27,000 ft. of timber, and said to be worth £4OO,
was cut down at Tyalgum, near Murwillumbah
(N.S.W.), the other day. Flow the timber-getters of
the long ago came to overlook the vegetable is a
mystery, as it was quite close to a well-worn timber
track. Certainly, it was partly hidden by a fig-tree.
A BAD LOOK-OUT.
BAGMAN: “ Well, Mr. Cregan, how's business?"
CREGAN : “ Bad. I dunno what the country's cornin' to. Them that has the money keeps
it, an' them that don't 'ave it spends it."

“Mr. Ocky”: Came across it lately— a
place where there is continuous rain. At Barra-
munga, near Forrest (Vic.), the oldest inhabitants
speak fondly of a certain far-back time when the
weather struck for one day; and the younger genera-
tions are incessantly calling on History to repeat
itself. That seems to be their eternal hope. What
a paradise for Kink O’Malley 1
“Panhandle Pete”: In Wonthaggi, the
Victorian coal and publess town, five shillings will
keep the sparrer in beer, lashings of it, for 12
months. The cadgus operandi is as follows: Having
joined one of the local clubs (ss. will do the trick),
the sparrer accosts the thirsty passer-by who is not
a member. Would he like a drink? Nine times
out of ten he would. “Right; give’s sixpence, and
I’ll take you into the club and shout.” And, as
beers are thrippence a pot, his word is as good as his
deed.
• * * *
“Gip”: The best man I ever saw hand-
ling wild horses was a Monaro (N.S.W.) native, a
lean, soft-voiced six-footer, who - could gallop . a
brumby where the ordinary rider would have to lead
him. This expert was as gentle with the animals
as he might be with a child, but he could do just
as he liked with them. One Saturday I saw him
bring in a rolling-eyed, thick-set mare that he had
caught on the previous day, On Monday she got
tangled in a barb-wire fence and badly cut, and her
capturer, after clearing her from the wire, tethered
her with an ordinary halter, bathed the wounds and
sewed them up. If I went within 20 yards of that
brute the whites of her eyes invited me to come just
a little closer to be pulverised. The man seemed to
have hypnotic power, and I came to the decision
that he knew brumby talk. Tried to get some of
his experiences, but he shied badly at that for fear
it might have the appearance of “skite.”
* * * *
“9-3-11”: “E.J.C.” (B. 8/6/’ll) may rest
assured that the sickening of mullet when a rifle
bullet is fired amongst them is simply due to con-
cussion, just as with dynamite, but on a smaller
scale. The ordinary mullet weighs about 21b., and a
rifle bullet weighs about loz. Supposing “E.J.C.”
to be about lOst. in weight, he can get an idea of
the mullet’s feelings by entering comparatively shal-
low water, and having a 41b. 6oz. bullet lobbed into
his vicinity at rifle-shot Velocity.
# * * *
“Rabbit Trap”: “Snakebite” (B.
15/6/’ll) says there are no rabbits in South Gipps-
land. What part of Sydney has he lived in for the
past several years? Next time he gets a holiday
from the store, let him bring a gun to Korumburra
and I’ll show him where there are herds of rabbits.
If he happens to miss a bunny he’ll shoot a cocky,
and it’s all the same to me. [Somewhere about 119
other contributors demand that “Snakebite” should
be arrested for perjury.—Ed. B.]

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At So-and-Soapulos’s cafe at lunch time the diners
all stood up and sang “God Save the King,” the
music being supplied by the cafe band. —Thrilling
News Item.
I say! they’ve been, and gone, and done
A patriotic thing !
The hungry eaters rose as one
. And sang “Gor’save the King!”
The violinist gave the note
Upon his loudest string;
Each luncher promptly cleared his throat,
And howled “Gor’save the King!”
Some left their soup, and some their eggs,
Some left off bolting ling,
And rose upon their loyal legs,
And yelled “Gor’save the King!”
The chops grew cold ; so did the duck,
Likewise the chicken-wing;
The crowd was Coronation struck,
It had to save the King!
The ancient, honorable cheese,
Unnoticed, made a spring
For safety—while the devotees
Stood up to save the King!
The tea was far too weak to stand,
The cream too thin to cling;
The pancakes lay flat when the band
Struck up “Gor’save the King!”
These were disloyal, though, perforce;
But therein lay the sting,
For ’tis a most misguided course
That cannot save the King!
The music stopped, and all sat down;
The cash-till rang ting-ting I
It was the first time half a crown
Had ever saved the King!

SPIRITED AWAY.
"And did you see any spirits at the statue? ”
"No; but they were there all right—they stole
my watch."
NO TRICKS FOR HIM!
THE NEW DIRECTOR: “ Here! Loafing, eh?”
THE WORKMEN: “Gam! It's crib-time."
THE NEW DIRECTOR: “Crib time! Crib time! No, yon don't—not while I’m on
the Hoard.”
Cornish fell down the winze at the Hole
and Corner mine, and, when he. was fished out and
hauled to the surface, it was found that he had sus-
tained two broken wrists and various unimportant
bumps and bruises. A litter was extemporised out
of Hammond’s bunk, and Cornish was placed upon
it, and raised shoulder high. When the procession
started, the patient piped somewhat nervously:
“Here, hold hard ! Where are you takin’me?” “Home
to your wife,” replied Hammond. “Home to my
wife?” squealed Cornish. “Home to my wife —with
two broken arms? How d’yer think a man’s go in’
to defend himself?” They trained him to the Bal-
larat Hospital.
“Wang”: Albert Dorrington’s book, “Chil-
dren of the Cloven Hoof,” wherein he relates the story
of a family of cattle-
lifters in Queensland,
gets close up to fact.
Knew a spot there
myself, where, oft in
the stilly night, over-
landing cattle would
suddenly bolt, and, al-
though all hands anil
the cook wheeled after
them, several were al-
ways missing. Then, af-
ter a useless search, a
reward for their . return
would be announced,
and generally it would
be collected by a fam-
ily in the vicinity,
consisting mostly of
two girls and their
brother. One nignt,
during a stampede, a
watchful drover took
a pot-shot at an indis-
tin c t form flitting
about on horseback.
The form dropped, and
when gathered in was
found to be a sun-
burnt bush-girl who
had received more than
one reward from the
same party. She
wasn’t much hurt, but I never heard of cattle being
stampeded thereabouts again. Possibly this was due
to the fact that one of the drovers married her.
* * * *
“Hecagus”: “Quidam’s” recipe (B.
8/6’ll) for scaring white cockatoos from the new
corn-patch is a good one; but I know a better. I
remember one season when; as fast as we hid the
seed, the ’toos unearthed it. At last we bought
some rum and steeped three bushels of grain in it,
and scattered the lot at the bottom of the paddock,
the ’toos’ usual haunt. In an hour’s time the whole
push was gloriously fighting, screeching drunk. We
bagged 200 odd.
“Tom Spargoe”: I can’t give the origin
of “running the cutter,” but I can say it is not
native Australian. Fifty years ago it was the
common phrase at a ship-building yard where I
toiled on the Clyde (Scotland). Was benefited by
it, also, in a Devonshire foundry, an iron-works on
the Thames and in a lodging-house in London,
Haven’t been introduced to it in M.L. yet; but
probably it was discarded by the inhabitants years
ago as obsolete. How to get beer quick is a fine
art in this country, and “rolling the barrel” into a
public park and scoffing it at a sitting is much more
rapid than “running the cutter.”
* * * «
Another bush christening:—-
“Smith,” called Bill from the far
side of the fire, “did you notice—- —” ?
“Mai name,” broke in the new chum
loftily, “is Soldred-Smith. Give me
my full name and my hyphen, for
God’s sake! They’re about the only
things I’ve got left now!”
From his pocket he drew a creased
card and solemnly passed it over to
the recumbent Bill, who looked wild
enough to'eat him. Bill took the bit
of pasteboard, straightened it out,
and regarded it long and thought-
fully. The hyphen busied himself
with his swag.
“Handy thing a hyphen,” remarked
Bill, after a pause. “A cove might
hang his billy on it, or use it as a
blanky fowl-roost if ever his blanky
relatives sent him enough money to
build a home.”
“Look hyah!” cried Soldred-Smith
warningly, wheeling round.
“Or,” continued Bill, in a loud,
offensive tone, “if yer cut a notch in
the top yer could use it for a clothes-
prop, or beat the dog with it, or stick
it in th’ garden and tie rose bushes
to it, or give it to th’ wife for stirrin’
th’ clothes on washin’ days. If things
come to th’ worst and it was strong
enough t’ stand yer weight, yer could
sneak a bit o’ clothes-line and hang
yerself to it.”
“Look hyah, now!” gasped Soldred-
Smith, in helpless rage.
“I don’t go much on these hand-
cuffed names,” concluded Bill. “I
haven’t got time to call any man two
names—-even if he does harness ’em
together with a parrot perch. You
blokes heard me try to call this cove
Smith, and you heard him stop me.
I haven’t got time to call him' Solder
as well. I reckon I’ll call him
Roost.”
So Roost it was, until the hyphen-
owner got another job.
In the Jeparit district (Vic.) the foxes
have developed a new habit. For some time past
they have been killing lambs, so the cockies have
been hunting them persistently. As a result, the
foxes have taken to tree-climbing; anyway, a cocky
who riddled one on a pine tree the other day says
he had to climb 40ft. to get the brush.
* * * *
“Stickpicker”: Can any Abo. inform me
if the pine adder, blue-mouthed species, is venomous?
Fencing recently on the Lachlan, I happened to lay
my forefinger on one of the above-mentioned reptiles,
and on examining my hand I noticed a few strands of
a filmy substance, similar to a cobweb, lying on the
knuckle. Old bushmen have informed me that this
substance is ejected whenever the adder is attacked,
and, if lodged in the eye, it is certain blindness.
Anyhow, next morning my finger was puffed up and
painful, and remained in that state for close on
three weeks, despite different liniments and embro-
cations.
“The Tramp”: Talking about weather-
prophets, can anyone tell me how Black Brother
foretells rain, and especially big rains? There is
no doubt he can do it; and I’ve known a nigger
lift his nose, sniff deep, and say he smelt rain
coming, even when there wasn’t a cloud or a sign of
it in the vicinity. Generally his black nose was in
the right, which is more than I can say for the
white Noes.

“L. 8.” : The man-bird has a long way to
go before he reaches the speed of the small thing
of feathers and hollow bones which he copies. Take,
for instance, the frigate bird, the beast with the
pendulous throat-bag, the exact purpose of which
is still a puzzle •to ornithologists. Aubudon, who
studied the habits of these birds for over a year on
the Florida Keys, asserted that they swept through
the air at much over 100 miles per hour. When
living in the Pacific, I once noticed several black
specks high in the air. They were visible for per-
haps two or three seconds, and then vanished. “What
were they?” I asked a native. “Katafa” (frigate
birds) the man replied. “They go from Nuitao to
Ulakita, where they breed.” “How far is that from
here?” “Fifty leagues.” “And how long will it
take them to get there?” “It is now two hours
from sunset, and they will be at Ulakita, at rest, on
the pandanus palms before it is dusk.”

“Philander F.” : Murray Island, in Torres
Strait, possesses an interesting work of some an-
tiquity. Some thousands of acres of shore have been
built in with rough stone walls designed as fis’.i-traps,
strong and enduring. Writer questioned the natives
some two years ago as to the origin of these walls,
but could glean nothing beyond a few misty tradi-
tions about giants of old. As a fish-trap the con-
struction answers successfully to this day.
“Drayman”: Another instance of the
quaint tricks of speech of our (mostly) departed
Black Brother. One of the chief black outlaws in
Tasmania in Governor Arthur’s time was a N.S.W.
aboriginal called Mosquito. He was imported as a
tracker, but afterwards joined the Tasmanian blacks,
becoming boss of a tribe and the leader in several
raids on stockkeepers. He was captured, tried for
murder, and duly strung up at Hobart Town, on
February 24, 1824. It is recorded in “Melville’s
Annual” (V.D.L. 1835) that while waiting for the
hangman, Mosquito had a conversation with Mr.
Bisdee, the gaoler, expressing the opinion that hang-
ing was “no good for blackfellows,” but “all right
for white pfeller: him used to it !” Six white bush-
rangers had to mount the gallows the same morning
as Mosquito.
* * * *
“Tractor” : Wagga Bill was telling us
that bullocks ain’t what they was. Said William:
“I landed in Wagga-one day with 14 ton sewt. on
eight poddies. Their eyes was sticking out of their
heads like bullets —you could have knocked them off
with a stick. A mounted John rode up and says:
“Don’t you think you’ve got those poddies loaded
too heavy ?’ I never said a word —just backed the
leaders, brought the whip across the off-side poler
and dug the boot into the nearsider, and she rolled
along. ‘There,’ I says, ‘you concertina-booted, big-
paid loafer. What’s them other six for?’ Them was
the days when bullocks was bullocks.”
* * * *
“Phil Harum” : How’s this for a strange
case of 'foster-parentage? A settler on the Bogan
(N.S.W. i has a cow which suckles three young pigs.
The porkers first acquired the habit of exploiting the
bull’s sister as she lay in the paddock. As they
grew larger they followed the lady round and tugged
away whilst she was feeding. The cow seemed to
enjoy the operation; the pigs certainly did.
THE ONE THING NEEDFUL.
BILL (who has had his beer taken): “’ Ere ,
that’s pretty cool!”
MAT: “ It’s all the same ter me, hot or cold —
I ain't partikkler’s long’s it’s wet.”
THE LOYALIST: A TRAGEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
George Albert Edward Connaught Brown
Adored the Person, Throne and Crown.
A humble elerkling he; but oh !
He worshipped Royal functions so.
He loved to make the welkin ring
With yells of homage to his King'.
Such joys he never could resist:
He was, in brief, a Loyalist.
Arrived the Coronation week;
George Albert, usually meek,
Became intolerantly proud ;
His eye flashed fire, his voice grew loud ;
A Union Jack, like some live coal,
Blazed brightly in his button-hole.
His villa flew gay rags enough
To stock a; shop or house of “fluff.”
He forced his faithful wife to wear
A Royal Standard in her hair.
Their offspring’s clothing was, in hue,
Exclusively red, white and blue.
So hour by hour —as is the way
With these events —approached The Day.
George Brown, though hitherto opposed
To alcoholic drink, disclosed
A sudden yearning love for pubs
And bars and smoking-rooms of clubs.
Here all day long he might be seen
Toasting the Empire’s King and Queen.
Ilis clothes, no longer drab and dun,
Gleamed garish as the mid-day sun.
Spurning his billet’s sordid needs
He yielded him to loyal deeds.
The Coronation Day and Night
He found a dream of pure delight—•
A paradise of flags, songs, cheers,
Howls, speeches, lights and frequent beers.
For three ecstatic nights and days
George sang and spoke his Sovereign’s praise.
Then turned, with a regretful sob
Or moan, and sought his loathly job.
Amazing as the fact may seem,
His Boss informed him, with a gleam
Of hate in his disloyal face,
That he (the Boss) had filled his place.
George Albert Edward Connaught Brown
Fled shocked and horrified from town.
Arrived at home he found that it
Contained a person with a writ.
His household’s gallant flag-display
Had cost far more than he could pay.
A bill for clothes—red, white and blue—
Was thrust at him: ’twas overdue.
A set assault on Brown was made
By the Disloyalists of Trade.
You would have thought this worthy man
Was some distraught Republican.
The outlook, for the Browns, is bleak ;
He flies his schedule Friday week.
ENVOI.
Be Loyal if you must. But oh—
Recalling Brown’s grim fate —Go Slow.

THE DULL BOY OF THE FAMILY. '
The leader of the Opposition is
guarded. Interviewed yesterday, here-
marked : “ What will develop in the
near future I cannot say.” Friday’s
division on the Industrial Bill showed
that the Government’s real majority
was one.
Mr. David Storey, leader of the inde-
pendents (Democrats), thinks that the
remedy for the existing high pressure
«s not a new election, but coalition.
Voice.from Beneath the Hat: “I don't
see any thing to cheer about l ”
Mr. McGowen, the Premier of New South Wales, will
not be back until September. He is going to extend his trip
in order that he may visit Canada, and the Legislative
Assembly yesterday granted him extended feave of absence
in order that he may do this.
ADVICE TO MOTHERS.
The Anglican Archbishop (Dr. Wright),
presiding over the annual meeting of
tne members of the Mothers’ Lnion at
the Town Hall recently, said that while
it would not be safe for him to lay down
rules for mothers in dealing with their
children, he urged upon them the advis-
„ableness of not leaving the matter of
*= discipline too late in the child’s life.
WHY NOT A WHOLE MENAGERIE?
The Queensland Government has succeeded in
choosing a horse for presentation to the King. The
animal was selected by a committee including the
Commissioner of Police.

GETTING THE MACHINE READY.
The N.S.W. Liberal and Reform Association is
holding a conference in order to get the party
machine ready for the next State election.
News item.
“Do you think he will frighten them , Air.
Portly?”
“ Can't say, ma'am; all I know is that he is
frightening me.”
“Wally” Redin, for 23 years on Adelaide
advertiser, during most of which period
he ran the aiternoon paper, has thrown up
journalism in order to breed sheep at Kan-
kalilla, Darling Downs (Q.). He has the
double-barrelled reputation of never having
done anyone an ill turn and of being an
authority on poultry.
“E.E.” : If there is a gold medal or pen-
sion attached to the honor, or accident, of
being the first white horn in Victoria, please
enter John Melbourne Gilbert as a claimant.
His idea is that he was born somewhere
near the site of the present Customs House,
Melbourne, on December 19, 1835. His
father, a blacksmith, was one of the party
fitted out by Fawkner at Launceston and
sent across in the schooner Enterprise. John
Melbourne now lives at Ravine (N.S.W.).
Norman Jolly, of S. Aus., who goes to
Bananaland as Director of Forestry, was
the first Rhodes scholar from his State.
After finishing his course at Oxford, he
joined the Indian Forest Department, and
then came back to Australia and his beloved
gum-trees. He is a good all-round athlete,
and at one time gave promise of being some-
thing choice as a wicket-keeper; but he finds
more joy nowadays in looking after larger
sticks than he can find at the end of a
cricket pitch.
Died the other day, at the Melbourne
home of the Little Sisters of the Poor, Mick
Mahony, one of the best known of Cobb and
Co.’s men in the days when the coaches
were heavy with gold and the tracks
spiinkled with men who wanted some of it
badly. Mahony frequently met Ben Hall,
O’Malley and others of the profession, but
though he had to look down their gun-
barrels several times, he got through with a
whole skin. When the railways came,
Mahony was driven north into Queensland ;
and there he stayed on the box until the sun
and ague got too much for him.
Up to the time the addresses started in
the Coal Vend case towards the end of last
week, the coal and ship-owners had spent
£16,000 and the Commonwealth Government
£lO,OOO. As many as 12 piles of horse-hair
have been around the Bar table at the one
time —and mostly very expensive hair.
Australian pioneer type-founder H. J.
Thitchener cast his last font lately. He set
up a casting plant in Melbourne 32 years
ago, passed on to Sydney in 1885, estab-
lished the Australian Type Founding Co.,
and continued his hard fight against im-
ported goods until Death called in on him
at 70.
A bronze statue to a big man, Westralia’s
late Engineer-in-Chief O’Connor, designer of
the Fremantle harbor works and the gold-
fields’ water system, has been unveiled at
Fremantle. The statue is by Porcelli, of
Fremantle, but the casting was made in
Italy. It is the largest but one in Aus-
tralia.
Shipbuilder Henry Beattie, who died
lately, aged 83, was brought from Scotland
57 years ago by the co. which subsequently
developed into the A.S.N., and he laid down
the co.’s slip at Darling Island (Sydney).
Later on, with T. Ferguson, of Mort’s Dock,
he became a pioneer of the Australian iron
shipbuilding industry, and turned out:,
among other vessels, the Tinonee and Leich-
hardt —tw T o well-known old-time coastal
steamers. For 35 years his firm has been
at Balmain, ready to build, but mostly
hobbled by a fool tariff to mere repairing
jobs.
Dead at Clare, in S.A.’s “lower North,”
John Christison, who came from England
with cattle for J. H. Angas 30 years ago,
and had run affairs generally in that district.,
ever since. He presently found brewing pay
better than station-managing, and thus be-
came patron and president of many local
concerns. There was just one thing he could
not do —get into Parliament. Always bluff
and impatient of contradiction, he refused
to give smooth answers to awkward ques-
tions, and those answers always smothered
his supporters’ hopes.
Canon Slaney Poole recently wrote a
warm letter to Bishop Thomas, of Adelaide,
on the subject of im-
porting parsons to fill
snug billets. As a so-
latium, perhaps, the
laity gave the Bishop
an address congratu-
lating him on stopping
in Adelaide five years
without wanting to go
to England. This ad-
dress was signed by
Barker, chairman of
the South Australian
Jockey Club; Carr,
chairman of the Ade-
laide Racing Club;
Stirling, a steward of
Onkaparinga Racing
Club ; and von Doussa.
brother of the sec. of
the Onkaparinga. After
this, the Bishop may
be reasonably expected
to cast a fatherly eye
on the sport.
Another annoying example of verbiage in
a cable (28/6/T1), which mentioned that
“Mr. Murray, the Victorian Premier, is rest-
ing in Scotland.” Why not merely state
that he was in Scotland?
ALLEN TAYLOR , Mayor of Sydney ,
and one of the crop of Coronation Knights.
Adelaide lawyers are agitating for a fourth
Judge to assist in catching up arrears —
mostly the Chief Justice’s —and coping with
increased work. Murray, K.C., will proba-
bly be the man, if Attorney-General Denny
does not follow precedent and collar the job
himself.
The Victorian Premiers office has received
an intimation that King George has made a
rule not to accept any composition in M.S.,
neither will he accept the dedication of any
work unless the writer is known to him.
Randolph Bedford is expected to fed very
annoyed over this.
HARD TIMES.
PRISONER: “I’opes

James M. Walker, who came level with
his 84th year-post at South Melbourne re-
cently, claims to have been among the first
to cross the Rocky Mountains. In 1847, or
thereabouts, he clambered over the Rockies
with several others who had left Chicago
for California, lie came on to Australia in
1852, and was in the Vic. Government service
for 28 years, mostly in command of dredging-
operations at Geelong, Belfast and the Gipps-
land Lakes.

William Strawbridge, who died at 68 last
week, had been S.A.’s Surveyor-General
since the retirement of Goyder in 1894; but
his health had been broken for several years
past, and he had been often out of harness.
Under his rule —and Goyder’s—the Land
Boards of S. Aus. have been absolutely
clean. There was no suggestion of undue
influence anywhere, and in Adelaide nobody
has ever thought of using “land agent” as a
reproachful epithet, any more than “doctor”
or “blacksmith.” Strawbridge was a Bristol
boy, but had been 60 years in Australia,
and close on 50 in the Government service.
He was chairman of pretty well everything
on the Crown Lands side of affairs, and in
the drought at the end of the century Par-
liament left it to him to reduce rents at his
discretion, the delicate adjustment involving
—it is said —27,000 leases. Actively reli-
gious, like so many South Australians,
he put his faith in the mystical Swed-
enborgian brand. E. M. Smith, his Deputy,
who has been in control of the Survey
Office for some months past, will presuma-
bly succeed.
According to a Yankee magazine, Judge
Douglas White, the new Chief Justice of
the U.S. Federal Supreme Court, and the
first Southerner in office since the Civil War,
is a big, genial, fat, athletic man who chews
tobacco while on the Bench, and off it is a
baseball barracker.
Oliphant Smeaton, whose name appears
on Cold-country book-lists as editor, novel-
ist, bookman, and ready writer generally,
was formerly known in these States and
Maoriland. Like a great many other liter-
ary men, he graduated from the clergy; he
wrote brilliant essays for the old Victorian
Review, edited papers in Goulburn and
Maoriland, and wound up
his Australian career as edi-
tor of the Argus at Rock-
hampton. In the city of
Sin, Sweat, Snakes and Sor-
row he was a tower of pen-
strength to the Central Sep-
arationists while they were
going strong in the late ’Bo’s,
when Rockhampton, writh-
ing in agony after the burst
of the Mount Morgan stock
boom, was seeking to wreak
vengeance on somebody.
Smeaton’s father, a famous
Edinburgh professor of “exe-
gesis philosophy” (whatever
that may be), died in the
early ’9o’s, and Oliphant
went back to the auld toun
to claim the inheritance and
settle down to literary work,
amid the familiar smells of
childhood.
Died, at Campbelltown (Tas.), John Wil-
liam Bergan, aged 77, a son of Peter Lalor's
sister. The father leic Ireland suddenly for
political reasons, and his wife —patriot
Peter’s sister —followed a year later. One
of the just-deceased’s daughters, Estelle, is
probably the best-known woman in the La-
bor movement in Tasmania.
South Aus. is losing three of its young
officials. Richardson. Assistant-Director of
Agriculture, goes to Victoria ; INorman Jolly
to Queensland, and Dr. Herbert Basedow to
the Commonwealth. The first graduated in
agriculture and science in Adelaide; the
second in science at Adelaide, and in arts
and forestry at Oxford ; Basedow won the
degrees of Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor
of Medicine at Breslau and Gottingen. The
salaries offered outside the State are much
better than those paid within it, and older
officers block the local way to promotion.
A. E. V. Richardson, who goes over to the
Victorian Agricultural Department, repre-
sents the highest type of the modern scien-
tific farmer. He is M.A. as well as B.Sc.,
and has held an English-literature scholar-
ship. What is more important, however, is
that he is an expert in experimental farming
and wheat-crossing, with a special gift for im-
parting to others what he has found out for
himself. At a recent congress, M‘Coll, of
Victoria, declared that this young S. Aus-
tralian’s exposition of dry farming was the
clearest and best he had heard outside
America. His new billet carries with it
£O5O a year for five years certain.
A LESSON IN LITERATURE.
TEACHER: “Now, Willie, can you describe an
arc? ”
WILLIE : “Yes, mum! A nark’s a bloke that's
always shovin’ his dial inhere it ain't
wanted.”
Uncle Sam’s Harvard University has
awarded the Ames prize (a bronze medal and
400dols.) to J. W. Salmond, Maoriland’s
Solicitor-General, for a treatise on the law of
torts.
A word from the Bar: —
N.S.W. Supreme Court Judges are not now the
impressive-looking lot they used to be. Martin,
Darley, Faucet, Innes, Windeyer, Owen —all these
had something of the “je ne sais guoi”—was it the
mutton-chop legal whiskers we miss now. To
begin with, our men are all so confoundedly young-
looking. The four newest—Street, Gordon, Fer-
guson and George Rich, J.J—are quite youngsters
from the forensic standpoint. Of the older genera-
tion, Equity Chief Simpson, J., though bearded, is
insignificant in stature (if it be not contempt of
Court to say so), and has to stand up to his work
in a little dock, which is graded to give the illusion
that he is sitting down. Pilcher, K.C., once caused
smiles (smiles only are allowed in the Equity juris-
diction ; laughter would make the startled and
shocked roof fall) by saying: “This is as certain as
that your Honor is sitting in that chair!” Sly has
a beard, which is just seen above the Bench. Cullen,
C.J., impresses more by his merit than by his ap-
pearance. Pring, J. (much improved as a Judge,
and now one of the best of them, though a little im-
patient at times), has a sombre and melancholy
manner, which gives him the appearance of a judi-
cial Hamlet, and his robes “but the trappings and

EVE IN GIPPSLAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The committee of the Leongatha (Vic.) Public
Library has by resolution removed Mark’s Twain s
“Eve’s Diary,” on account of the alleged indecency
of the illustrations. — Argos, 22/6/’ll.
Eve came wandering back to earth,
White and fragrant as a flower ;
Joyous in her second birth,
Drank the sunshine for an hour;
Then on swift feet made a sally,
Running through a Gippsland valley.
Henry Pumblechook, J.P.,
Looked amid the ferns, and saw
Dazzling limbs, hair flowing free,
Panting breast without a flaw,
Lips as bright as budding roses
Pumblechook said “Holy Moses!”
Not a thought of Eden ran
Through the mind of Pumblechook,
Though (like every pious man)
He had read the Holy Book.
Pumblechook without delay
Sent for Constable O’Shea.
Shrouded was her hair aflame,
Covered was her blinding glory ;
She must don the garb of shame
In a grim Reformatory ;
Happy Eve is now a goner
Judkins preached a sermon on her.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wowsers Judkins, Worrall, Woodful, Mauger and
co. are all strongly opposed to the State establishing
a monopoly of the drink traffic, just as they fight
against the licensing of the tote.
I walked once in the bush and found
A brown and bearded man
Stretched out at ease upon the ground.
Beside him was a can.
I asked what might his calling be.
“ ’Tis rabbit poisoning,” said he.
He smiled at me, and rubbed a sly,
Insinuating snout.
“Of course,” he said, “I really try
To wipe the rabbits out.
I spread the poison bit by bit- —
But bunnies seem to thrive on it.
“I love a simple job like this.
The pay is always there,
And if my doses sometimes miss,
I guess it’s only fair.
No blanky poisoner’s goin’ to quell
A plague on which he thrives so well.”
I drifted, and to musing took.
The parsons fat and thin
As this man looks on rabbits look
On any vulgar sin.
’Tis something giving them employ-
They must attack, but not destroy.

This co. doesn’t own the Brisbane trams. It owns
all but 20 or so of the shares in the co. which owns
the Brisbane trams. It was this way. The Brisbane
Tramways Act was passed in 1882, and gave a co.
14 years’ street tram rights. At that time Brisbane
was satisfied with horse traction. Then the late Mal-
colm McEacharn, a man with a keen eye for a con-
cession, came along, and on behalf of a co. offered to
give Brisbane an electric service in return for 25
years’ exclusive rights. There wasn’t much difficulty
in getting that put through in those days; and there-
upon McEacharn, whose co. hadn’t really any money,
cleared off and floated this mostly-English co. to
finance his co. But McEacharn knew that there are
always two or three or more lots of people to appeal
to —the man or the widow who wants safety above
all things, then those who are prepared to take a
slightly bigger risk for the sake of a slightly bigger
return, and finally those who are neck or nothing.
McEacharn, therefore, issued in all £450,000 of 44
p.c. debentures for the benefit of Class 1; then
75,000 in £5 5 p.c. cumulative pref. shares for
Class 2 ; then ordinaries for Class 3. When the co.
got to work, things were bad in Queensland, and
Brisbane remained stagnant for some years. The or-
dinaries naturally had a wretched time, and their
cake looked so much like dough that as late as
1906 the £5 shares were only worth 17s. 6d. Then
manager Badger began to smile. The debentures
and prefs. take the same amount of profit whether
things are good or bad; consequently when things
are bad they are likely to be very bad for the people
who practically hold a third mortgage, but when
they are good they are likely to be very good; for
then the ordinaries find that they hold more than a
third mortgage—they are entitled to all the cherry
that is left.
The Tramways Co., as distinct from the Invest-
ment Co., has had the following recent history:—

1910.. 222,580 115,695 106,885 106,000 77,908
Of those reserves, £75,000 is to the credit of a Re-
newal Fund. The past year’s dividends are cut up
by the Investment Co. as follows: Divs. (as shown
above), £47,656; debenture interest, £19,069; ex-
penses (the Investment Co. doesn’t, of course, pay
any of the working exes., but only its own office
charges, etc.), £9913; and the balance was avail-
able for reserves. Hitherto the Tramways Co., be-
fore declaring a dividend, has made a big appropria-
tion to the Renewal Fund; but for last year it
didn’t —it paid over practically all its revenue in
excess of working expenses, and thus gave the In-
vestment Co. a chance to build up its own formal
Reserve Fund to a respectable figure. Probably it is
thought that the accumulated profits may attract
less attention if they are cut up in this way. Any-
how, even if £lB,OOO is written off to the credit of
Renewal Reserve, the profit for last year, after pay-
ing debenture interest and pref. div., was equal to
just on 16 p.c. on the ordinary capital. And quite
possibly it isn’t necessary to write off £lB,OOO, be-
cause manager Badger may have been paying for
a good many renewals and other things out of his
Working Account.
As mentioned above, the co.’s concession runs till
1920 —25 years from 1895. The municipality may
then take the concern over—by paying for it, but
without paying anything for goodwill. As invariably
happens when a city or anything else jobs away
rights of this kind, troubles have arisen. Brisbane
is spreading, and naturally wants more tram facili-
ties. “No,” says the co., in effect; “settle down
alongside our existing lines, pack our trams, and in-
crease our revenue without adding to our expenses.”
It is no use growling at the co. for saying that, be-
cause it is precisely what the authorities should have
expected that a dividend-making concern would say.
Also the nearer the co. gets to the end of its life the
less hope will the city have of getting extensions. A
co. isn’t going to spend a lot of money, and pay in-
terest on it during the non-productive stage, when it
will only have five or six years to make good—and
in those first five or six years almost any new line
is almost certain to pay poorly. These are things
that ought to be thought of before a concession is
granted. If they were thought of, of course no con-
cession would be granted. Which is the very ex-
cellent reason why they are carefully suppressed
until it is too late.

This co. is no doubt doing much better than it did a
while ago. It is in the land-subdivision business;
and until the present boom happened along, there was
for many years gloom in that industry. Worse still,
this co. had a very large quantity of city and other
property on hand; and though part of the property
was productive, consisting of country lands, there
was precious little left after interest had been paid
on the deposits and other debts. Better things began
to arrive after 1903 ; and this and other land cos.
started to look up. The rapid increase in the popu-
lation of suburban Sydney caused a building boom ;
and, while in any case that would have pro-
duced a land-subdivision boom, the introduc-
tion of municipal taxes on unimproved land
values, followed by the Federal land tax,
made a large number of big holders very keen to
pass on their possessions to somebody else. This
meant in most cases, of course, that extra-liberal
terms have been offered to encourage purchasers; and
that has prompted a whole lot of speculation. In
this way, probably, 10 allotments have been sold for
every one house that has been built. Whether those al-
lotments are going to be paid for is another matter ; it
depends on how long the present prosperity lasts.
Evidently this co. is backing the boom to last; any-
way, instead of reducing its holding of land, it is
actually increasing it. The following comparison
shows that and other things:—

City properties stand just where they have stood for
some time past, while “other properties”-—which in-
clude the unsold parts of the Furracabad estate, near
Glen Innes —are actually moving up. Well, if the co. is
prepared to take the risk of refusing present prices,
it is pretty sanguine. Quite likely the co. paid a
good deal more for some properties than it could get
now. For many years past the published figures
relating to the value of estates in hand have been
treated as a joke;, and though the co. professes to
have a big reserve fund, the share-market persistently
says that it hasn’t even got more than about two-
thirds of its capital intact. However, if the co. is to
be killed, it has evidently made up its mind to be
killed for a sheep and not for a lamb. This paper
therefore regards it as speculative; and, though it
may no doubt come out with flying colors, it is at
least equally likely to be again knocked back by bad
seasons to a 3 p.c. proposition. Its misfortune —or ours
—-is that we don’t know what the published balance-
sheet figures are worth ; and that is a situation in which
the outsider is at a great disadvantage compared
with the insider. It is monstrous, anyhow, that a
co. which takes deposits should be permitted by a
rotten Companies law to issue a balance-sheet claim-
ing assets of a value far in excess of what it well
knows those assets to be worth. That unquestionably
was the case with the Haymarket at one time, what-
ever it may be to-day.
John Bridge and Co., Ltd., wool and
pastoral produce salesmen, etc. (Sydney).—Though
this well and very favorably known co. is 14 years
old, it had until recently been a private concern. As
at March, 1910, the paid capital was in 22,000 6 p.c.
cumulative pref. shares and 33,007 ordinary shares,
all of £l, fully paid. During the next few months
15,333 ordinary shares were issued ; then, on decid-
ing to extend the business in Queensland, 29,660
more ordinaries were issued at a premium of £l.
Thus the paid capital was brought up to £lOO,OOO,
the full amount authorised. Instead, however, of
transferring the £29,660 of premium capital direct
to a Reserve Fund, which would have been the best
course, the amount was taken into Profit and Loss;
but the proper thing has now been done by transfer-
ring a level £30,000 to a Reserve Fund. The past
year’s history is shown hereunder: —

Revenue has been charged with bonus to staff
( £400) and depreciation (unspecified). The allow-
ance for depreciation is important, because freeholds
and leaseholds stand in the accounts at no less than
£111,333; and as leaseholds in particular are a
wasting security, it is imperative that they should
be written down adequately. Plant, furniture, sun-
dry stocks, etc., represent £12,516; and these also
may be subject to heavy depreciation. Accounts
which don’t specify the amount of depreciation in
such circumstances leave a lot to the imagination.
Further, the co. has just “purchased a valuable
block of land at Bulimba, Brisbane, and a contract
was let on Jan. 9, 1911, for the erection on this land
of what will be one of the finest wool stores in Aus-
tralia.” Australia is now either blessed or afflicted
with high prices for almost everything ; and as it is
extremely probable that more than a normal price
has been or is to be paid for both land and building,
it is very desirable that the capital value should be
promptly written down out of revenue. It is very
pleasant, no doubt, to pocket profits of 20 p.c.; but
it goes almost without saying that when a country
is so prosperous that a co. such as this can make
profits like that, money is extraordinarily plentiful
and prices extraordinarily high; and the co. which,
in view of its own big profits, launches out into
buildings, etc., must expect to pay unusually high
prices to other people too. A very substantial part
of the profits should, therefore, be set aside as a de-
preciation fund. If that is not done, it will be a
miracle if the co. is not left presently with over-
valued assets; and, with shrunken profits, it will be
then much more difficult to write the values down to
a fair thing. This applies no more to this co. than
to a hundred others. It may, of course, be that the
management of this co. has made the most abundant
provision for a shrinkage of values; on that point
nothing at all can be said, because there is absolute-
ly no information available. If such an allowance
has not been made, the additions to visible reserves
are very small indeed; out of a profit of £18,885
all but a poor little £1965 goes to the shareholders.
And when a co. with a reserve already accumulated
of only £192, apart from premium capital, pays a
20 p.c. dividend, one feels doubtful whether the
management isn’t unduly optimistic.
Apart from the freehold and leasehold properties
( £111,333), the co.’s principal asset consists of “Ad-
vances and sundry debtors, £42,547.” Its own cap-
ital and reserve being insufficient to finance those
customers who need financing, the co. itself has bor-
rowed £35,000 on mortgage. Practically without
exception these pastoral-produce cos. are shying off
advances; but if they want to keep their commission
business, the shying-off may be a more troublesome
matter by-and-bye. And then the co. may be glad of
bigger reserves—or more capital; and there won’t
be any 18 or 20 p.c. profit to be made on that capi-
tal. Further, it has to be remembered that landed
properties have been changing hands in unusual
numbers lately; and there have been fine and un-
usual profits in that, too, for cos. of this description.

“On the 17th May the special case stated by the
Arbitrators was heard before the Privy Council,
when judgment was reserved; but the directors ex-
pect to hear the result at an early date.” That is
the most important part of the present report and
accounts; and until the Privy Council’s decision is
given, the future cf the co. will remain uncertain.
The City Council offered the co. £158,866, being
the estimated value of the tangible assets. But the
co. said that its goodwill was worth a vast sum, and
the matter went to arbitration as provided by law.
The arbitrators, after inspecting the law at long
range and close quarters, said that the Council had
the right to acquire the undertaking by paying for
the works in situ; but, on the application of the
co., they stated a special ease for the Privy Council.
If that venerable body of old gentlemen who have
left off wearing horse-hair as a regular thing say
that the arbitrators are right—though there is never
any telling what the P.C. will say —-the shareholders
will go out and take just about 30s. per share with
them. That is to say, they will take out 20s. per
share of capital ( £125,000) plus the reserves, which
are equal to about half the capital. Of course,
the plant, etc., in situ may be valued at a bit more
than the hook value; in that case the shareholders
will have a bit more to divide. There appears to be
no possibility of its being valued at less. If, how-
ever, the Privy Council says that the Council must
pay for goodwill—which means if the people must
purchase their own custom —then the shareholders
may have another £1 to divide: it all depends on
what the goodwill is valued at.
The eo. supplies both gas and electric light; in
fact, though it is called a gas co., it has nearly
twice as m"ch invested in the electric light under-
taking as in the other branch; and the electric light
revenue ( £28,585) last half-year was about double
the other. The electric light also gives the better
net profit: say, 21 or 22 p.c. in the one, as Com-
pared with 15 or 16 p.c. in the other. Altogether
it has been a most prosperous concern, and the early
shareholders have done amazingly well. At one
time, while some of the shares were only partly paid,
dividends and bonuses totted up to 50 p.c. p.a. on
these latter shares. The consumers, in other words,
have provided a great part of the capital spent on
the works; and, having provided the capital, they
have been caving 20 p.c. divs, on it —to somebody
else. It has been an extraordinarily soft snap for
the somebody else.

Three divs. of Is. each have been paid during the
year, and a fourth is declared, making the total dis-
tribution £200,000, or £6024 in excess of the
profit. The £6024, as well as the year’s deprecia-
tion (£24,707), has to come out of the balance
brought forward from the previous term. The Con-
tingent Fund has also been drawn upon slightly
during the year, being reduced from £54,225 to
£53,397 ; but the Insurance Fund has been increased
from £40,992 to £45,558. The profit for the year,
it will be seen, was £193,976 (that is without writ-
ing off depreciation) as against £358,192 for the
previous year. Part of this big shrinkage was due
to the fall in copper. The following shows the
average prices realised for a little while past:—
Per Ton.

1911 „ .. .. .. 58 4 7
The copper output was 6973 tons; so the shrinkage
in value meant a loss of about £13,950 to the co.
That means that the bulk of the shrinkage in profit
is attributable to other causes. For one thing,
mainly owing to difficulties—mostly unexpected
—-met in connection with the introduction of Many
Peaks flux, the co. treated considerably less ore.
Thus: —

Auriferous copper . . . . 220,189 173,209
Silicious sulphide .. .. 124,122 109,371
Oxidised 52,917 Nil
On the other hand, the co. fed into the furnaces dur-
ing the past year 52,289 tons of Many Peaks metal-
bearing flux ; and the use of that fluxing ore—which
has to be purchased—only began during the past
year. The fluxing ore brought up the co mer output
pretty well—there is less than 100 ton o difference
between the two years—-but the gold output shrank
from 178,8670 z. in 1910 to 142,4490 z. during the
past year; and that is where the big slump in profits
happened. For, unfortunately, last year it cost
rather more to handle the 642,491 tons of ore (in-
cluding Many Peaks flux) than it did the 754,126
tons in 1910. Costs, however, for the past year can-
not be regarded as normal.
As to this matter of costs, etc., the directors might
be a lot more convincing than they are. “The altera-
tions-and extensions of the copper reduction works,
including the erection of one additional furnace, are
now almost completed,” they say. “The delay in
their completion has chiefly been due to difficulty in
the execution of orders for the necessary new ma-
chinery, and in obtaining sufficient labor of a suitable
kind for its installation.” Probably plant has been
delayed; but the directors might say with equal
truth and more force that the job involved in the
change-over to Many Peaks flux was too big for the
staff, which hadn’t realised the difficulties. Theoreti-
cally they may have worked everything out beauti-
fully ; but they seem to have lacked the experience
necessary to promptly overcome troubles when they
arose. This is not surprising when it is remem-
bered that from being a gold proposition, Mount
Morgan suddenly changed over to a copper proposi-
tion, and a fairly difficult one at that.
Reference was made above to a Contingent Fund,
which stands at £53,397. This reserve was pru-
dently created during the copper boom of three or
four years ago, and consisted of part of the sur-
pluses derived from the sale of .copper on a rising
market. It is preserved to protect the co. in case it
should overdraw on a falling market, and thereby
take credit for more than is actually realised on
final adjustments. As for the unsold copper remain-
ing on hand at the end of the year, the conservative
practice is to value it at only £5O per ton. The
blister (copper containing gold) on hand on May 31,
1910, was thus valued at £786,559; on May 31,
1911, at £719,979. The co. has thus had the ad-
vantage, apparently, of selling a little more copper
than it produced; and, though that doesn’t mean
much, it has helped the past year’s profits a little.
For instance, if the co. had 1000 tons on hand in
1910, and 900 tons on hand in 1911, and if the aver-
age price realised in 1911 was £5B, it would mean
that the 1911 accounts got the benefit of 100 tons
of copper at £B, being the difference between the
value at which it was taken credit for and the price
actually realised.
The financial position is strong:-
1910. 1911.
Assets apart from mine and
plant .. .. ..£444,988 £370,504
Liabilities .. .. .. 55,492 Nil
Surplus £389,496 £370,504
So the co. has paid the year’s dividends and made
and paid for additions to plant, and to do it has had
to draw on its accumulated liquid resources to the
extent of £18,992.

The Tolwong (N.S.W.) people want an-
other chance to prove that they were not utterly and
hopelessly wrong. According to a circular issued by
the directors, dated May 11, their liabilities are:
Bank of N. S. Wales, £3565; advances by share-
holders, £5689; sundry creditors, £2614; total,
£11,868. The B.N.S.W. holds a mortgage over
everything, “and has consented to allow the present
indebtedness to be paid off by appropriation of half
the profits earned”—which is about ali it could do to
get out of an uncomfortable hole. The proposal is
to issue 10,000 pref. shares, the shareholders who
have made advances to have the right to a share
(paid to 165.) for every £1 advanced. Their present
position is, of course, worse even than the bank’s.
To get the money, it is proposed that the pref. issue
shall be entitled to a cumulative 15 p.c. p.a., and
to . then come in for any additional profits a W
with the ordinaries, pref. and ordinary share takinf
each the same-sized bite. The manager is hoDeftd
enough to estimate a profit of £126 per week. 1
This paper doesn’t say that no profits will be
made out of the Tolwong; but it does say that some!
body or other ought to go to gaol over some of the
boom statements that have hitherto been made about
the mine, and the ridiculous plant that was out on
on it, and the value of the few tons of stuff that
were produced. In fact, grossly misleading state-
ments were made almost up to the time J O Arm
strong dropped in his report. Instead of there beiim
vast quantities of rich ore exposed in the gorges and
only waiting to be blasted out, Armstrong found
things like this: “No. 8 workings.—Two short open-
ings, not extended far enough to prove anything ”
“No. 7.—Two shallow openings made, but nothing
of any value exposed.” “No. 6a workings.—Pull of
water, but said to show nothing but small irregular
stringers of ore.” “No. 6 workings.—Only string-
ers of ore; country very much broken up.” And so
on. Summing up, Armstrong said—“To prove anv-
thing as to quantities and values, Nos. 3, 4 and "6
should be carried another 100 ft. at the Very least
and then connected. So far as the workings have
gone, the ore seems to keep oh pinching and opening
out in the fissure, but more work will have to be
done before anyone will be able to arrive at anything
like a correct opinion as to the value of the pro-
perty.”
The most shameful part of the Tolwong business
was the way in which the pigeons were fooled as to
the value of the highly refractory or'e. There seem,
to be always a hew Crop of idiots who can be got to
believe that the more metais there are in an ore the
more valuable it must be. As a matter of fact, the
more metals there are the more costly it is, as a
rule, to get one or two of them ; the others are irre-
coverable. In this case Armstrong says—“ The mine
will have to be taken on its copper values, together
with any gold and silver present.” The alleged
great tin values are dismissed, and the fortune to be
made out of arsenic evaporates. Moreover, instead
of the ore standing in great faces awaiting charges
of fracteur, “mining costs will be heavy on account
of the flatness of the lode. Large pillars of ground
will have to be left to make the ground safe; timber
will not do, and filling would not be of much use.
The ore will take a lot of hand, .ng.” Finally, while
it was absurd to put up any plant at all until the
co. knew whether it bad any ore to treat, “I am
afraid the furnace would all go out of shape in a
very short time.” Practically, Armstrong didn’t say
anything at all that hadn’t been already said in The
Bulletin ; but he had facilities for close inspection,
so his report is valuable confirmation ; and it points
to the worst scandal in connection with N. S. Wales
mining for many a vear.
The prospects are very poor. In ordinary circum-
stances the thing wouldn’t be worth touching. If no
money at all had been spent on it, it wouldn’t be
worth risking any money on it. But, since a good
deal has been spent on it, it may be worth while
risking a few pounds more, purely on the back-up-or-
forfeit principle.

It won’t surprise anybody who kr ows the
man, and who also knows how the Commonwealth
Oil Corporation is being run, to learn that George
Georgeson has resigned. After much experience
with Scotch shale and oil, he was sent out to take
charge of the business side of the bloated undertak-
ing, and latterly has been acting manager. When
Georgeson has left the co.’s service and can speak, it
will probably be found that the shareholders and de-
benture-holders haven’t been told things that he thinks
they ought to know.
A tin show at Germanton (N.S.W.) has
been quietly floated (24,000 shares at £1) by a non-
mining crowd. They have 100 acres to work at, and
the apparently hopeful spec is named The Placer Tin
Mining Co. J. V. Wood, of Melbourne, is legal
manager ; and the man at the infant mine is Rudolph
Wachsmith, a German who knows the business. A
dredge is now on the ground, and a first clean-up is
promised for August. Thus far, the lowest prospect
taken averages 61b. to the yard ; and if the machine
tells anything like that tale, there are sweet divs.
ahead.
“Gwy”: The management' of the Zinc
Corporation gives shareholders only the most meagre
information concerning the details of the union with
the B. H. South Blocks. The latest development is
not, a mere amalgamation, but a proposal to wind up
the Zinc Corporation, and form a new co. in 245,69''!
pref. shares of £l, and 658,616 ordinary shares of 10s.,
such ordinary shares to have the same rights as the
others for purposes of dividends. Of these shares the
South Blocks people are to receive 66,666 preferential
and 200,000 ordinaries, which leaves the Zinc holders
precisely the same number as before. Nor does me
writing down from 16s. to 10s. affect the existing Zinc
ordinaries, as on a winding up they are to be treated
as if paid to £l, which restores them to their orig-
inal status. But, in view of the words italicised, it
may be queried whether the holders of Zinc prefs.
who are entitled to a fixed 20 p.c., and thereafter to
share pro rata, will take the new arrangement lying
down. These were drastic terms, but when they put
their money up the Corporation was, or was supposed
to be, in desperate straits; and they put it up on a
definite understanding. On the other hand, if it
should turn out that they still retain these rights, the
holders of ordinarv Zincs, who have been hanging on
patiently for years, will presently be heard asking
why the South Blocks crowd should come in on the
ground floor, and acquire preferential rights over
them. Perhaps the Melbourne office will do a little
explaining.

When Govett, chairman of the Lake View,
told his shareholders in London that the amalgama-
tion of the Broken Hill South Blocks and the Zinc
Corporation would be a good thing for the South
Blocks, he spoke the very solid truth. In fact, the
amalgamation is going to save the Blocks from a
very violent slump. In spite of all the gaudy fore-
casts, the mine was proving itself hopeless at present
prices. Repeated attempts to give the stock a bump
up failed pretty badly. Then came a dividend which
should never have been paid.. But still the market
didn’t respond. As a matter of fact, the figures were
too plain—the co. was making no real headway worth
mentioning. The last card was the amalgamation;
and, if it comes off —and there can be scarcely any
doubt about it —Lake View can afford to shout itself
a drink over a lucky escape.

Shares in B.H. British have just doubled
their value in nine months, mainly owing to fairly
satisfactory ore-developments. But the management
has still to prove itself; it is the weakest feature of
a situation that, taken all round, isn’t nearly as
strong as the share market.
Queen Bee (N.S.W.) is crosscutting for
the southern or subsidiary ore-body that gave some
very patchy prospects at 570 ft. A winze is down a
few feet from that level, and the crosscut is ex-
pected to strike the formation in a few days. No-
thing is said about developing the main ore shoot,
which pitches rapidly north of the shaft, and should,
on the past record of the mine, be well worth pros-
pecting. The ore body south of the shaft is prac-
tically virgin, but its value is decidedly speculative.
A very promising property at Wyalong
(N.S.W.) is the Erin’s Isle, which has just handed
out £4 per share as the result of development by
tributors for the past 12 months, at the 330 ft. level.
During this time crushings, aggregating 190 tons,
averaged nearly 20oz. gold to the ton, raised from a
reef 9in. to 12in. wide. The tribute expires a few
weeks hence, and the owners will then work the pro-
perty on wages, and on a more extensive scale.

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes Table is the “Wilfley.” It is continuous, anil
consists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged
in a tank of slimes or material to be filtered. The
drum is covered with a filter cloth supported on
grooves on the drum, which are connected by means
of holes to the interior to allow the liquid to be
withdrawn. Through the trunnions at the ends of
the drum the vacuum pipe passes to the interior.
This pipe connects with the interior of the drum,
through which the liquid and air are withdrawn by
means of a vacuum pump. The filtered slime is re-
moved by a simple apparatus placed at or below the
level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly the
cake is removed, the surface of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately re-immersed in the pulp
ready to receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the
sucking in of air, and consequent loss of vacuum
between the time the cake is removed and a fresh
one is forming. The residual liquid in the slime
cake is removed by distributing water over the sur-
face of the semi-dried cake. Owing to the fact that
the filter is circular in form, it will be seen that it
is continuous in operation, and has no complication
of valves to get out of order; furthermore, work is
being done continuously during the whole revolution
of the filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have the sole manu-
facturing rights of this filter.* [2

Ironbark, Bendigo, put up a decent yield
and scrip trebled in value, mainly under the in-
fluence of the Beehive. The co., after reaching out
to the Sheepshead line at 480 ft., hit a rich patch ot
stone. Quartz was picked up between two runs ot
lava, and, as it is widening out, the problem wlncn
had to be solved was whether this meant the top ot
a reef. There were those who foretold a lodwt.
yield ; but 16 tons from the winze topped 620 z. lhis
total is small potatoes to make a big market on; but
there has been so little for Bendigo drummers to
beat on since Central Blues have settled down,
that some enthusiasm is excusable. A lot more work
is wanted to prove that the shoot of stone has any
length, and until enterprise that way gives the
measure, the worth of the find is a matter for pure
conjecture; and the man in the street can conjecture
just as well as the broker or dealer in the Beehive.
Nevertheless, good has come out of the racket, inas-
much as the sleepy crowds in the Victoria Consols
and Hercules and Energetic are getting ready to re-
sume active work on the slabs of ground they possess

Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.), has shown its
heels once again. Puffs were spread on the market,
because in No. 8 level some nice specimens could be
got out of the face. While the country rock was as
tight as a door-knocker, the lode was more or less
formation; though the word passed round was that
the formation was the most consistent seen for two
years. Still, this wasn’t much in the way of paint-
ing the lily, because Ajax for two years has been
within measurable distance of the end, failing an
addition to reserves. What the market won’t grasp
about Daylesford is that the flat markets are the
jewel pots, not the vertical lodes. Until a decent
flat make figures in the Ajax armory, its position
remains that of a wasting property.

Kalgoorlie Chamber of Mines is backing
up the Victorian institution of that name in its re-
quest to the Westralian State Government to inves-
tigate the circumstances connected with the acquisi-
tion and subsequent flotation of the Chaffinch. It is
pointed out to the Government that the police court
proceedings against Bonwick, Dyason and Greenway
were inconclusive, and, in the “interests of mining
morality,” the appointment of a Commission is
urged. As a set-off to the statement that Magistrate
Roe affirmed that the mine was not salted, it is worth
mentioning that Roe did so without hearing the de-
fence, which relied mainly on evidence of salting.

Another glaring case of everything being
said to be all right when it is all wrong. The
other day an official circular was issued in London
stating that there was nothing to justify the* drop in
Oroya Links. Nonsense! There are several reasons
for the fall, and it is hard to believe that the direc-
tors aren’t acquainted with some, if not the lot. The
turning down of the Gimlet option at Ora Banda is
one; the derelict state of the co.’s holdings other
than the Eclipse lease is another; the poor quality
of the ore at present exposed in the Eclipse property
itself is still another ; and the inability of the man-
agement to make ends meet, through a variety of
circumstances over which it has no control, is still
another. Small profits may be earned when the
Eclipse ore is opened up at greater depth, but the
outlook for dividends isn’t too hopeful. Fortu-
nately the co. is well off financially, its liquid re-
sources now amounting to £55,000 —equal to nearly
Is. per issued share.
* * * *
At the end of 1910 Chaffers (W.A.) had
cash resources amounting to £22,859, of which
£13,000 was invested in Australian Government se-
curities. The year’s bullion and sundry receipts
totalled £73,165 ; and, after allowing for everything,
a credit balance of £3136 remained. Nowadays the
co. manages to make a little money by treating ore
from its own property and the adjoining Boulder
mine, where stone of a little over 30s. grade is being
stoped out of Lane’s workings, the gold recovered
being divided on a basis satisfactory to both par-
ties. But the present system of working leaves no-
thing for shareholders, and, as a last resource, the
management has asked the London directors to sanc-
tion the expenditure of £3OOO in special develop-
ment on the off-chance that the ore reserves will be
more than doubled. This might enable the co., by
treating a bigger tonnage, to pay dividends —for a
time.
* * -X- *
Discussing the co.’s possessions at the
Lake View meeting in London, Chairman F. A.
Goveft said that, as the chief asset was a five-eighths
interest in the Lake View-Star, it was comforting to
know that the mines worked by this concern were
now yielding a surplus at the rate of £30,000 a year,
with the probability of that amount being increased
to £40,000 as time rolled on. As regards the Zinc
Corporation-South Blocks amalgamation, he thought
the value of Lake View’s holding in the latter co.
would be enhanced by the combine. About the
Burma mines he was a bit dubious; the oil interests
were “about the same” ; and a host of sundries, in-
cluding the Amalgamated Zinc, which showed a profit
of £lO,OOO, were “doing well.”
Official reasons given for the Lake View
reorganisation, which was agreed to by shareholders
in London on May 22: “That now the mine has been
amalgamated with other properties in another cor-
poration in which the co. holds a controlling in-
terest, its basis as a mining concern will have tech-
nically disappeared as soon as the work of re-
treating the remaining residue dumps is finished;
that the directors can only continue the other busi-
ness of the co. at their own risk, and that it, there-
fore, is necessary to reconstruct the co. on proper
lines in order to remove this difficulty; that this
can only be done by the formation of a new co. and
transfer of the assets to such new co.” The value
of the assets, which largely consist of shares, is esti-
mated at £350,000.
Associated Northern (W.A.) now derives
a revenue of about £6OO a month from public crush-
ing, and the amount is increasing. It also rakes in
£250 a month, or thereabouts, from the treatment of
its own ore; but some people who ought to know
what Uiey are talking about say that the co. could
do much better than this if it let tributors work the
whole mine. Seeing that reserves have now almost
petered out, it is probable that this will be done be-
fore very long.
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) got a raking
in the Kalgoorlie police court the other day for em-
ploying three men underground who couldn’t speak
English. The management admitted that two of the
men hadn’t any knowledge of the language, but
reckoned the other foreigner knew a little. The Court
found that neither knew any of Shakspeare’s tongue,
and, after emphasising the danger of employing
such men, imposed a fine of £lO and costs in each
case. There are any number of “Jack Smiths” and
“Bill Browns” working underground in the West
who hail from Dagoland, and who don’t know a word
of English. In fact, some of the out-back mines are
occasionally full of them.

Several Meekatharra shows have been
priced during the past month by agents of Melbourne
and Sydney capital; though, as leaseholders want too
much, no business has so far resulted. Meantime
a lot of good stone is being sent by claimholders
to the Fingall mine for treatment; but until suffi-
cient inducement is held out to capital and its pals
to come along, the lower-grade stone, of which there
are considerable quantities, must remain neglected,
as the present cost of transit and treatment is pro-
hibitive in the case of stone below jjoz. value.
“Oof Bird” (W.A.) : “R. 8.” and his fol-
lowing (if any) are entreated to come to
the rescue of Bullfinch. Having found the
railway from Southern Cross to be a dead
loss, the precipitate Government has effected
drastic alterations in the service. Now a train con-
sisting of an engine and a combined carriage and
van runs twice a week, and stays an hour at Bull-
finch. Other indignities lately heaped on this fraud-
ulent centre include the wholesale abandonment of
leases and the withdrawal of salaried correspondents
by the dailies. The wooded landscape is dotted with
mullocky tombstones on the graves of local and
foreign capital, and a healthy rivalry exists between
the local undertaker and the local auctioneer in the
despatch to the outside newspapers of the news of
what is going on —which isn’t much.
“R. 8.”: “Oofbird” wants to know why
I wrote something he alleges I did in B. 12/l/’ll,
when I knew “some time after the middle of De-
cember” that the Bull Ant wasn’t a mine. There
are such things as time for mail carriage and delay
of publication; but even if there weren’t, was I to
imitate “Spoofbird’s” marv.ellous wisdom after the
event, and damn a thing utterly because Grut’s
values hadn’t persisted? The point to be settled as
to whether I am “a fool or the other thing” is al-
ready settled. My friends know that I am neither,
and the others don’t matter. But there’s no point
to be settled about “Spoofbird.” Judging him by
his own insinuations, the kind of fowl he is is a
lying cuckoo. Meantime, Mr. Grut’s sampling still
sticks out through the whitewash.

Fremantle Trading Go. (W.A.) has fast-
ened on to an old lead mine at Northampton as a
means of earning its living. A crushing and dress-
ing plant has been erected, and, by-and-bye, when a
promised railway extension comes along, the leady
concentrates are to be trucked and sent to smelting
works by the seaside. Like its insolvent ancestors,
this co. hasn’t done very much to justify its exist-
ence, and the announcement that it has got hold of
over 1000 acres of freehold mining property, with
several lead mines included, may help to cheer share-
holders to stand by it if any monetary trouble
should arise. It has other irons in the fire, too.
Some time ago the co. bought a sandy heap at Point
Moore, near Geraldton; and as the Government has
selected a site for a new railway station in the
vicinity, the co. has decided to divide this area into
building allotments, and try to get rid of them.

Queensland maintains the gross value of
its mineral output. The total last year was
£3,710,222. That is better than the output recorded
10 years since; but profits are nothing like what
they were. The three largest producers—Mount Mor-
gan, Gympie, and Charters Towers —have all suffered
in that way. Practically one-half (£1,874,555) of
the Queensland mineral output is now obtained from
auriferous copper deposits, and these are always
costly to treat. At the moment the State is
struggling with difficult metallurgical problems, ac-
centuated by high costs and inadequate transport
facilities. The change over from gold-bearing
quartz veins, worked at shallow levels, to refractory
mineral, cannot be described as easy.
Great Fitzroy (Q.) is still in a bad way,
mainly because the assays of crude stuff and the re-
covery by flotation are below expectations. A loss
of practically half the gold and 30 p.c. of the copper
made the low-grade silicious stuff (assaying in bulk
slightly over 2 p.c. copper and 2dwt. gold) unprofit-
able ; so milling had to be suspended. The blast
furnace has been smelting ore assaying over 3 p.c.
copper, and on this grade, with a few shillings’ worth
of gold and silver to help, it is probable that a profit
can be made. Getting an improved furnace ex-
traction even at the expense of picking, appears the
only hope unless copper takes a rise. As a matter
of fact, some of the big American mines pay divi-
dends on li p.c. ore; but Fitzroy costs are heavy.
The Chillagoe Co. is erecting a small
sampling mill on the Etheridge. The idea is to
sample all ore, weigh, and pay the owner on the
spot, before the stuff goes to the smelters. The
small owner, to whom prompt pay means much, is
expected to be thankful in a practical way.
* * * *
The district in the vicinity of Hampden,
Elliott, etc., on the outskirts of Cloncurry, is going
a head —with sheep. Devencourt, which was practic-
ally idle for years, is being fenced in, and water is
being got all over the place; it looks as if it will
shortly become one of the big sheep runs of the
North. Other stations are going to belt in on the
same lines. , „
Mount Oxide (Q.) was under offer to an
English crowd at £lOO,OOO and a tenth paid-up
share interest, but was turned down. The crowd
that secures Oxide will have to spend a fortune to
get material in and products out, and it takes a
good mine to return £lOO,OOO, plus the £200,000
which would be required to place it m a paying
condition. Mount Oxide is a wonderfully rich forma-
tion ; but an outlay of at least a quarter of a mil-
lion makes even J. Bull think hard.
Mount Mulligan coalfield, which forms
part of the old Hodgkinson goldfield (N.Q.), is at-
tracting a good deal of attention, especially from the
Chillagoe people. Three Chillagoe directors, includ-
ing Chairman Reid, went the other day to have a
look round; and a coal expert has told them that the
coal may be expected to spread itself over 30 square
miles of country. Two seams exist, and the country
is not faulted. Though the mineral so far unearthed
is not of the highest quality, it is said to be suitable
for coke-making and steam-raising. A trial survey
of a 30-mile line is being made; this line would
junction with the Chillagoe Co.’s metals at Dim-
bulah Station. Material for making cement exists
on the Chillagoe line,' and cheap coal may launch a
new industry in those parts. But apart from that side-
line, cheap coal, anti especially coke for the smelters,
would be a big thing for that section of North
Queensland. At present a ton of smelting coke runs
to over 60s.
The Bluff Colliery people, in Central
Queensland, are making a fresh start with bores on
their Mammoth leases. A 100-ton sample was ordered
from the Mammoth shaft for the Admiralty. Part
of it gave good results, and then floods came, and the
rest of the parcel never left the mine. Now a bore
site above flood-level has been selected. The Bluff
might be a happier concern; its rival, the Blair
Athol, goes along much more smoothly, with an in-
creasing output.
* * * *
vVolfram Camp (N.Q.) is feeling better,
having hopes that two Frenchmen, representing the
Society of Rare Metals, will erect a plant to treat
low-grade material containing bismuth, wolfram and
molybdenite. The outfit they talk about will cost
£20,000, and be capable of treating eight tons per
hour.
Chillagoe ran its copper furnace 16 days
and its lead furnace eight days last month ; 2455
tons ore were smelted for 171 tons copper, 108 tons
lead, 16,8410 z. silver and 2280 z. gold. The extrac-
tion averaged between £4 and £5 per ton of ore;
but costs, with such a limited tonnage, are neces-
sarily heavy. Most of the ore is coming from the
Einasleigh, but the co.’s own mine at Zillmanton,
when it dries itself, is a likely producer. The flow
of water has been exceptionally * heavy, because the
Zillmanton is on the contact with the limestone. A
traction-engine is hauling some high-grade ore from
the Klondyke district, a few miles from Mungana.
* * * *
No. 3 North Columbia, Gympie, has
shelled out its second dividend —4d. a share. The
mine seems likely to turn out large quantities of
medium-grade crushing stuff from levels at 1656 ft.
vertical, driven 262 ft. north and 116 ft. south. No.
3 has a mill of its own, so costs are kept down.
Values are uncertain, depending on patchy makes of
specimen stone.
* * * *
No. 2 S. Great Eastern, Gympie, has sunk
its shaft to 1926 ft., so it is getting down to a depth
that corresponds with the Scottish Gympie work-
ings. The southern stopes on the Power reef con-
tinue to supply payable crushing stuff, but of lower
quality.
* * * *
Mount Lyell, for the first 32 weeks of the
current financial year, treated 79,693 tons ore for
2061 tons copper, 129,4920 z. silver and 22240 z. of
gold. The average is 2.6 p.c. copper, which would
give a fair profit irrespective of precious metals;
and the latter add from £lO to £ll to the value of
blister. At the North Lyell a large tonnage of
high-grade ore is being won at the 1100 ft. level;
but ventilation has been defective, and will not im-
prove until the rise holes through to the big stope
that has been operated at the 1000 ft. level. There
is an intermediate level at 1050 ft., originally put
in because of the extreme difficulty of tracing the
downward continuation of the ore body. Mount
Lyell’s development in its deepest level on both
sides of the crosscut is proof enough that the deeps
below 1200 ft. hold many secrets. Hugging the con-
glomerate, the schistose cupriferous ore body may
go down for thousands of feet.
* * * *
North Mount Farrell, one of the little
things which peg away in the remoteness of the Tas-
manian West Coast, hasn’t pegged with much suc-
cess lately. The half-year showed a working profit
of £664 on net receipts of £10,830, but that trifle
was more than wiped out on account of deprecia-
tion. There is a year and a-half’s ore in sight, and
with a new level opened up —the work is well on
the way—that quantity should be considerably added
to. But the co. owes close up to £5OOO in excess of
liquid assets; and with a mine of this size, and lead
and silver markets that are rather weak and not
likely to improve much yet a while, £5OOO is an
uncomfortable dead horse to have on the premises.
* * * *
New Ruby Flat Tin, Branxholme (Tas.),
still flourishes under the watchful eyes of Alf. Hughes
and Andrew Stenhouse. Wet weather spells good
profits ; dry weather no work and few drinks. Three
big faces are worked, and as the summer was moist
enough for an ordinary winter, the co., instead of
going on to the shelf for the time being, cleaned up
a little lot of tin which put it on to the div. list
more promptly than usual. Over 42,000 cubic yards
of drift last half-year averaged lRb. oxide, and with
the new face widening and showing good wash, and
with tin high, no loose scrip flutters in the market
place. The co., besides alluvial, has a big decom-
posed formation, said to be speckled with tin; but
lode tin is as treacherous as a Jap, so the co. had
better regard that formation as a hobby rather than
as a source of income.
* * * *
The Hercules (Tas.) directors have got
authority to amalgamate with the German smelting
people who own the works at Zeehan ; or, rather, to
sell to or otherwise traffic with those people. As
explained recently, the German smelters’ idea was
to get a leg in for the complicated Oker process;
but, though that plan may be adopted so far as the
zincy slags are concerned, the metallurgical advisers
of the Hercules are not likely to agree to the adop-
tion of that process exclusively. _ Sooner or later a
dressing process will have to be installed.
W.P.F.: That’s the position. Munroe
and Munroe failed; and the man who pushed off
Marconi (Canadian) shares on their account in Aus-
tralia couldn’t deliver. A few shares did come to
hand through the Union Bank ; and if anybody here
now knows anything about the business, that bank
does. .. . Komata: You don’t barrack for the non-
amalgamation of the two N.S.W. Savings Banks in
this paper. As to the ridiculous assertion that the
Government wants amalgamation in order to collar
the poor little reserve fund of the Barrack-street
Bank, how much is that reserve worth compared
with the guarantee of the whole State? And that is
the guarantee that the depositors will have if they
come under the State’s roof; and they can have no
more claim to it if they don’t come under that roof
than the depositors with the just-gone-bung Birkbeck
Bank had on the British Government. Further, the
varn re collaring the wretched little reserve fund is
plain rubbish. The Government may have the use
of that money; but it will have to pay for it, just
as it pays for any other loan. There is, however,
no undertaking whatever that the Government will
have even the use of the money; it certainly won t
if the funds can be invested to better advantage.
“Gouger” (from Lightning Ridge, N.S.W.) :
Opal-gouging isn’t a bad game —if you get on to
opal. One mate of mine has just come back from
a trip round the world, thanks to luck and a good
claim. He to'ok a parcel with him, and made his
expenses out of the sale. Another mate did the
same thing, going through Canada, and visiting New
York, London, and Paris, etc. Both are “buying
now, and gougers pray for their success. It might
help to stir up other buyers, some of whom wait
until a fellow is hard up before they will touch his
stuff Gouging is an uncertain business. The old
hand, who thinks he knows all about indications,
may belt away without seeing a color for months;
but let a pair of brand-new emigrants or a couple
of foreign sailors wander this way* and within a day
or two the word is liable to go round that “the
chums” are “on it.” The beggars seem only to
have to climb down some deserted shaft, and they
can scratch out a stone or two straight away. A
couple of Welshmen have just done this old trick,
the twelfth pair to my knowledge. Well, good luck
to them, anyway. #

TIL
TEA
Being a waitress in an hotel
isn’t bad work the different
people that come and go keep
you interested. Some of the
customers you like, and look
forward to their coming again—
but others, well, you simply hate
to see them come near the
dining-room. The only part that
isn’t too nice is when some of
the gentlemen take a drop too
much, but in the morning when
they come begging for a cup
of tea you can’t help pitying
the poor wretches, and how they
do swallow it, to be sure—just as
if their throats were “brick dry.”
Talking about tea, I’ve had
experience with a good many
kinds, but for giving general
satisfaction it’s my opinion
there’s none to beat Robur —
I’ve often been asked “what tea’s
this!” —and when I’ve told them
“Robur No. 1 Grade,” they’ve
looked surprised, as if they ex-
pected me to say it was some
very costly sort of tea —perhaps
the careful way 1 make it has
something to do with its tasting
extra nice—you see 1 don’t wet
the tea till the water is boiling,
and then 1 take care it doesn’t
stand too long. For your home
I should say you’d find the No. 1
Grade a very satisfactory tea
to use, and a little extra care
in the making will more than
repay you.

QUALITY—BUCHANAN WHISKY
“BLACK & WHITE
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, July 3, 1911.
My Dear Arini, —-
The Zealandia, bound for Vancouver, had
a full passenger list, which included various
persons in the public eye. Amongst them
were Lady Dudley (William Humble Ward
travels by another route) ; her old friend and
relative, Adeline of Bedford ; and Private Sec.
Walter Callan, who injected a brisk journal-
istic snap into his official letters, and was
credited with putting the point on her Ex.’s
public remarks. Katherine Grey, the Rule
Taylor triplet, Mr. and Mrs. Gerald Westma-
cott, and Mr. F. de Vere Lamb were also in
the exodus. Others in flight were the Rip-
ley trippers to this side. Sir Henry Ripley,
Baronet, is a landowner in two English coun-
ties, and varied this arduous career by tak-
ing a hand in the S’African squabble. His
usual recreations are hunting, shooting, fish-
ing and golf, though quoits and bridge are
liable to be added when he is threatened with
brain fag.
Tbe polo pony in a foam of latber, with
an ugly red stain trickling down one side,
was the gamest feature of last week’s polo
carnival. On Saturday afternoon her Ex.,
in a dark gown, with the ermine Coat of
Beauty, handed over the Countess of Dudley
Cup to the Muswellbrook winning team.
Fastened on to the muff that went with her
Ex.’s white, snow-drift fur wrap, was a
parti-colored rosette with a flare of red in
its ribbons. This was Lady Dudley’s last
public appearance here, and the (more or
less) Elect are now praying hard for the
coming of the Denman Excellencies, and a
more expensive wine-list at Government
House.
Lieut.-Gov. Cullen’s wife opened the Syd-
ney Club of Domestic Arts the other day in
the King’s Hall. The Victorian Ladies’
Work Association, or some similar vehicle
for the removal of the home-made stitch to
the back of the buyer, has been loudly ac-
claimed as an example for the new Sydney
sprint; yet it sticks in my mind, like hot
sealing-wax or wet putty, that the L.W.A.
consistently lost money for some years. Mr.
Macarthur-Onslow, M.L.A., who is a Lieut. -
Colonel of some frill in a volunteer corps,
handed over a few halting words of approval
—after much hunting for them in his
pockets and other likely places—to the jam
and sewing corroboree. The warrior is a
kindly soul, who can generally be depended
on by woman to lead a forlorn bope for her.
The Admirable King-Hall, who accused his
little daughter of being responsible for his
presence, also fired some tokens of his ap-
preciation.
Historic old Duntroon homestead has just
had its first official drink as a military col-
lege for Australian boys. Blinks, wbo has
an inquiring mind, asks : “Will Colonel Fos-
ter, . R.E., who emerged from the retired
British half-pay list to teach modern mili-
tary science at Sydney ’Varsity, occasionally
explode at Yassberra on his pet hobby, ‘The
Siege of Jerusalem’?”
A lady globe-trotter, who is gathering cats-
paw impressions of this desirable wool and
wheat patch, has been raking the Sydney
Sun, fore and aft, with a cross-fire of rude
remarks on the Australian Woman. It is
a magnificent ad. for the book this flitter
says she’s going to give to a world which
isn t shrieking for its publication. For the
rest, it is offensive froth, apparently whipped
together in penny trams and aerated bun
shops. Abnormal busts, flat hips, thick
ankles and boorish manners are the offences
that hurt the feelings of the unknown Miss
Plough of Despond when she casts her
weeping eye on Foster Fraser’s “sprightly,
sun-kissed Australians.” In case she isn’t
a myth (for she seems uncommonly shy of
breaking cover), I’m jumping on her ad. with
the large, flat feet she mentions as an Aus-
tralian woman’s perquisite.
H. H. Share, R.N., habitually Private
Sec. to Governors, who had a first look-in
here on the staff of Admiral Beaumont, and
a final wash-up in Gov.-General Northcote’s
retinue, had a long and extensive oppor-
tunity of gazing on the Australian female
face. He had been as a lad on the Royal
yacht, and made his first official bow (of
the right gradation to a hair-line) under the
august eye of Queen Victoria. His pro-
found knowledge of what the Vale of De-
spond lady calls “Good Society” may there-
fore be accepted without further apologies.
Mr. Share’s last impromptu comment on the
Australian girl occurred at a farewell party
to the popular Northcote lady. “I’ve seen
women in most parts of the world,” said he,
“but I think Australian women come first
for beauty. It is unwise, perhaps, to draw
comparisons, but I can’t recall any other
city I’ve been in that contains so many
strikingly pretty girls as Sydney.”
Federal politics and matrimony seem to go
together like almonds and raisins. Minister
O’Malley succumbed not long ago. Senator
Findley abandoned sewing on his own shirt-
buttons —or whatever insignia of liberty the
unattached male flaunts in the face of mere
spinsters—and went cheerfully to the altar
Acting-Prime Minister Hughes wedged in a
honeymoon, punctuated by a motor skid, and
married Miss Mary Campbell, of Burren-
dong _ (N.S.W.), before Parliament House
bad time to breathe its blessing. That makes
at least three Federal Ministers who have
paid our sex the compliment of marrying a
second time. Hughes, Tudor and Thomas
■were all left young widowers; and each in
due time remarried.
Though Acting-Prime Minister Hughes
and Acting-State Premier Holman are poor
friends politically, Holman expressed his
good wishes very neatly. His first speech,
after the wedding was announced, Holman
made at a Chamber of Commerce dinner.
Hughes had been invited, but sent excusing
himself on the ground of ill-health. “I was
sorry,” said Holman afterwards, “to hear
that my old friend Hughes is ill. I trust
that the complaint that is keeping him from
us will be with him for very many happy
years.”
Prof. David’s lecture on Antarctica and
the coming Mawson expedition, was rather
frost-bitten in its attendance. Four shil-
lings for reserved seats hit the general pub-
lic in some place that didn’t answer back.
The cheapest seats were filled with a com-
fortable crowd, but otherwise the chilly
Town Hall, with ice-packs on the lantern-
screen, was full of draughts and Austrian
chairs in all their naked cane. The newly-
knighted Allen Taylor delivered a brief pre-
liminary ode to the Mawson enterprise in
general, and Prof. David in particular.
The Lieut.-Gov. Cullens, who are slogging
steadily at the social top-dressing of their
present billet, came in to Prof. David’s lec-
ture with Captain Verney on their heels.
There was a mild effusion of bare heads and
warm evening wraps in the front seats. The
person who probably excited most envy was
the Shackleton expedition’s artist, depicted
on the screen in a snug sleeping bag, with a
candle perched on his temple and a book in
his hand. The arrival of the Cullens was
indexed by the feeble notes of a hidden
piano, which made an uncertain attack—ap-
parently on “Advance Australia Fair,” or a
cough in chords —and then limped through
“Gor’ Save.”
The Habitually Late stumble with a louder
thud than usual over the Early Worm at
Her Majesty’s Theatre. The Irving “Ham-
let” revival bites the evening air rather soon
after dinner, and the loiterers get no help
from the stage, which is draped in inky night
to swallow up the Ghost’s legs. He is a
most imposing Ghost. Henry Yibart, who
plays the part, haunts the Danish con-
science with a pale-green complexion and a
voice like a tolling bell.
Denmark must have been sadly down at
the heel when Claudius was King, for his
robe of State is like an up-country patch-
work quilt after it has been chasing a cer-
tificate of merit at local shows for 20 years
or so. Frank Tyars, who is Claudius, is
obviously one of the “sound” stock actors of
the older school, who never take liberties
with Shakspeare. He makes-up like King
John before the Great Wash, with a Magna
Charta frown of deep-dipped stage villainy.
And Queen Gertrude (Miss Helen Rous)
is as shabby as her lord. There was some-
thing so rotten in the state of Denmark,
when Claudius was sitting on its best garden
seat, that Gertrude’s tire-women —who are
not looking for work —were too limp to
mangle their royal lady’s head-drape, which
floats down her back in a dejected, wrinkled
wisp. Helen Rous has a musical voice, with
an emotional thrill in its back notes, and
gets a good deal of maternal thunder out of
her arras-curtain lecture to son Hamlet.
H. B. Irving, whose raven hair matches
the historic inky cloak—with a magenta lin-
ing—has completely captured the Sydney
playgoer, in spite of his legs and his father’s
chuckle. I’ve seen the elder Irving—though
not in “Hamlet” —and the parent’s manner-
isms are copied faithfully. H. B. carries the
present production on his shoulders as easily
as a boy carries a toy cannon. He is a great
Hamlet, and the booking is prodigious. You’d
find it hard to stab the applause with a hair-
pin between the gallery boys, so closely are
they packed.
. “The Gay Grisette,” at the Criterion,
gives Florence Imeson a good excuse to
wear gauze wings and an abbreviated pink
drape; this is as Cupid in the second act.
She’s a pretty, graceful creature, and pirou-
ettes on shapely limbs, chiefly clad in micro-
scopic pink-ribbon bandages. Cupid’s classic
bow and arrows are going to the scrap-heap,
like the Pah’f’l and the ’bus-horse; so
Florence was armed with a toy gun which
doubled forward with a Grecian bend in its
waist when it aimed at the front stalls. Polo
men dropped in on the first night of the
piece, and the stalls have seldom offered a
larger acreage of susceptible white shirt-
front as targets for ballet toes. Two boxes
were full. Miss Von Arnheim, in one,
showed a graceful scarf of shimmer and chif-
fon over a good-looking white frock.
The Norland Ball broke the first chill of
a wintry night by a grand march round the
Town Hall one evening last week. Mrs.
Greig-Smith and Lieut.-Col. Jack Antill were
chiefly responsible for this walking-out con-
tingent, which ducked its head or its knee —
as most convenient —to the Mayor and
Mayoress. The gorgeous Coronation set,
arranged by Mrs. Norman, bristled with
duchesses —Miss Martyn and Miss Bentley,
for instance—and had a handsome trim-
ming of the marchioness species. Count-
esses made an elegant tail to the dazzle, and
were squired by comparatively common per-
sons like fancy-dress viscounts and barons,
with a mere duke or two thrown in for luck.
Miss Olga Roth, who belongs to this winter’s
crop of debutantes, was one of the nicest-
looking damsels at the dance.
Whites and Wills-Allens loomed large dur-
ing Polo week at Kensington. The flower-
edaed polo dinner given by Mr. and Mrs. E.
White at the Australia the other evening is
alleged to have been the most sparkling as-
sembly of the Well-Fed for quite 48 hours.
F. E. Winchcombe, M.L.C., presides over
the Wild Life Preservation Society in this
State. The society met the other evening
and had a thrilling story of osprey fatalities
to tell in connection with this season’s mil-
linery. Lieut.-Gov. Cullen took the chair,
and A. S. Le Souef, David G. Stead, and the
learned W. W. Froggatt—who knows the
family history of ants, fleas and frivolous
ladybirds—made lantern-slide remarks. Sud-
den deaths in egret settlements are likely
to have the brake applied, if the Wild Life
Preserving Co. goes on harrowing the feel-
ings of Woman with its tragic pictures of
orphan bundles of white fluff writhing on
an empty stomach.
Mr. Herbert Allnutt, who recently mar-
ried Miss Lucy Cobham, of Mosman, is a
son of Parson Allnutt, of Cobbitty, where
they only change their shepherds of souls
about three times in a century. The Allnutt
family has kept open house to the country-
side for nearly 30 years, in a handsome old
stone rectory with gabled roof, and heavy green
whiskers of ficus, or some other close-fitting
herbage that climbs over its face. Before
Parson Allnutt’s day, Canon Pain, who’s now
another kind of ecclesiastical gun in Gipps-
land, put in about 25 years as Anglican
rounder-up of psalms and hymn tunes in the
Cobbitty paddocks. He followed, I think,
the Hassall autocracy, which lasted 40 years
or so. Ancient inhabitants prefer the mild
sway of the present parson, who is a good
sport, and encourages local cricket in the
rectory paddocks. Here, under the shade of
great wild apple trees, I saw a mighty com-
bat for supremacy last summer, when Brown-
low Hill estate (the Downes property) tried
to wipe the eye of Cobbitty with a cricket
ball. The Allnutt cow which grazed amongst
the players’ legs took reasonable care to

Yarraford, a usually peaceful village about
six miles from Glen Innes, has recently had
a violent eruption of Royal portraits. Big
and genial H. C. Holmes, a local identity in
wool, was moved last year to get rid of some
spare cash, and presented Yarraford with
the “King Edward Memorial Hall,” Miss
Brace, an English agricultural lady, who put
some of her capital into a snug holding in
those parts, tripped back to Fogland in 1910
with her friend, Miss Violet Alcock. Their
return to Yarraford was the occasion of a
school-children’s corroboree to welcome hun-
dreds of library books impounded by the
Brace-Alcock duet on the other side. Violet,
by the way, was secretary of the London Ly-
ceum Club for about seven years, and knows
the ropes. With Gov. Chelmsford to give
a tug at this end, she engineered the presenta-
tion of signed portraits of George and Mary
to the “King Edward Memorial Hall.” F.
J. Thomas, M.L.A. for the district, tore down
the drapery that shrouded the pictures in
the presence of the local nobility and gentry.
Yarraford is at present bearing its honors un-
der a hard frost, and is suspected of giving it-
self Coronating airs which may incite other
New England settlements to take to drink.
Off to try the snow on skis on Kosci-

Maughan (she is a daughter of Edmund Bar-

Who is the Cavendish-Bentinck the Van-
couver World says is following the Shef-
field Choir round the map? The Duke of
Portland, head of the Cavendish-Bentinck
clan, has a large circle of relatives of every
age and weight. The alleged love-lorn mem-
ber of the family is probably a half-nephew
or some other fractional part of the straw-
berry patch.
Lord Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, half-
brother of the present Duke, married a lady
with the ear-splitting prefix of Baroness
Mary C. de Heeckeren-Wassenaer, and has
two sons. One of these would be about the
age, 30 or thereabouts, of the Portland sprig
who is said to have laid down his share of
the family diamonds at the feet of Miss
Edith George, of the Sheffield Voices. She
is a Yorkshire lass, with an elder sister who
acts as watch-dog. The voyage from Fog-
land to St. John’s, N. 8., is quoted as the
scene of the Bentinck’s first proposal. Later
he is said to have chased the girl of his heart
across the All-red route, and to have booked
for these parts by the Zealandia.
A minor wail has just come from Thurs-
day Island. “Milk,” writes an indignant
housemother, “is Is. a quart, and meat 9d. a
pound all round—and generally it’s all
gristle. Children in every shade, from bis-
cuit to ebony, are as plentiful as peas in
pods, and tin houses scintillate in the vivid
sunshine in dazzling, irregular patches. The
surrounding sea is dotted with picturesque
islets, _ and the tropical vegetation is hand-
some in high-colored tones; but we’re more
interested in the sea, which contains pearls,
sharks, divers and plenty of oysters and
fish. Goats are as numerous as the varie-
gated children, and they all play happily
together.”
The British chaperon with “high” connec-
tions, Court influence, and no cash, has been
epidemic during the Coronating splash in
London. She has been stretching out a
hawk-like claw for Australian gold, with
large promises of introducing girls from this
side into the inner circle of the Best Set—
at bridge and other lotteries. The rich
American girl has either grown wary of this
type of elderly siren, or takes charge of her
own charms in Cold-land Society; hence
the ogre’s hunt after possible Australian
“clients.” It would be interesting to hear
whether any have fallen into her hands, and
how they fared afterwards.
The beacon-fires of Britain for the Coron-
ation blaze recall a queer perquisite that
once belonged to coastal clans in N B The
“privilege” of stoking watch-fires, and 'fline-
mg a log on dying embers, kept the male
members ot a Scottish family named Grant
th , e ™ m r°\ e s , ome centuries ago. In Hoki-
tika (M.L.) there is, or was, a Mr Grant
who is (or was) something in the Govern-
ment. One of his possessions was an ancient
watch with three beacon-fires emrravpd nn
its back lid. If he hadn’t dropped into a
peaceful century full of armored cruisers
and machine guns, Providence in kilts would
have laid him out to chop wood for bonfires
as a warning to sea-trippers with desiens
on North Britain’s oatmeal cakes
Anthony Hope’s new book, “Mrs. Maxon
Protests” (Roycroft Library), is a medi-
ocre love-story which follows afar off with
discreet silences —the mental earthquakes of
Wells’s “New Machiavelli.” This time it is
the lady who experiments, with a net result
of considerably less wreckage than she’d be
likely to achieve in a plain old world which
keeps Mrs. Grundy as perpetual referee. The
principal love affair of Mrs. Maxon, who is
young, pretty and emotional, doesn’t meet
with the approval of the cook-housemaid, but
otherwise seems to be fairly clear of fem-
inine scratches. Anthony Hope gives Winnie
Maxon £l5O a year of her own, stately seal-
skin coats and other desirable clothes, a
legacy of £l5OO, and, finally, a husband with
a new country house and old-fashioned
ideas. Hope’s book is an incentive to any
woman who’s ruminating over the “incom-
patibility of temper” crease in her matri-
monial affairs to try the Mrs. Maxon recipe.

“Out Back” is an unknown country to thousands of Australians, and on
that account possesses a charm that is all its own. Very few of our writers
have given faithful accounts of things as they are out there ; some are all gloom,
others all caricature: but in Sumner Locke we have an author who strikes a
happy medium, with the happiest results.. “Mum Dawson” is a pen picture
worthy of Dickons \ drawn, seemingly, without effort, so natural is it, «md
illumined with bright splashes of humor which are inimitable. It is safe to
predict that this new author will have a vogue that will rival, if not outrival,
any of the present-day Australian writers.

Gamblers of all kinds have a place in this book —the card-player at the club, the punter at the
racecourse, and the larrikin at the two-up school. The scenes at the various places are depicted with
this author’s usual power and picturesqueness, the characters being splendidly drawn and the incidents
thrilling in the extreme. There is a description of a fight worthy of Conan Doyle; a callous murder
for which an innocent man is blamed; a night at a two-up school as vividly portrayed as on a cine-
matograph screen; and a welshing incident at the racecourse. Side by side with all this there is a
dramatic love story which ends happily.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, July 4, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Lady Dudley, who is now on the high
seas, gave a carefully trimmed-down party
before she left here. There were only about
oO guests, and to them tenor Kirby, the pet
of duchesses, sang several songs in his best
manner. The day was cold, and the Little
Countess, in the most informal way, begged
the company to “come near the fire.” The
hostess wore a narrow’-skirted white cloth
dress that had, instead of the fashionable
fish-tail of the moment, a generous train,
ihe G.-G. strolled in with an affable air and
said “How d’ye do?” all round ; then grace-
fully retreated to the less-crowded fire in his
den. Governor Fuller and his lady came
late from the football match. His sub.-Ex.
inarched in with muddy boots and trousers
turned up above his spats. Mrs. Alfred
Miller struck the finest frocking note with a
beautifully-cut dress of black velvet, and hat
to match. Mrs. Reggie Power was in pale-
green ninon, with a wide edging of silver
lace and pale-grey squirrel fur. Mrs. Hughes,
the John. Grices and Mrs. Deakin smiled in
the firelit circle. John Madden’s lady,
like Mrs. Miller, was in black velvet. Tea
was a comfortable, sit-down affair, and was
served in the dining-room. Later, the
guests strolled back, and Kirby sang some
more.
The' Grand National, at Flemington on
Saturday, attracted a fine field of specta-
tors. It was a day of iced sunshine, and
the crowd kept moving briskly all the time.
Lady. Fuller ventured out in purple cloth
tailorings and beaver furs. Miss Phipps, in
a twisted-up velvet hat and turned-down
collar, moved about with a “sporting” air,
while his Ex. and an aide or two haunted
the paddock. Vera Clarke went into the
vice-regal box and chatted with the invalid
lady for some time. She wore squirrel
trimmings. to her grey velvet dress and a
waratah pinned in her squirrel muff.
Mrs. Warrnambool Airlie, with some up-
holstery borrowed from the squirrel family,
aroused admiration. There were two rows of
fur edging on her gown, with cape and tur-
ban to match. The squirrels would have
been delighted if they could have heard the
exclamations of the beholders. Mrs. Reggie
Power also flaunted squirrel furnishings on
the edge of her silver-green frock. She
passed the time of day on the lawn inside a
real Paisley coat and a squash hat that dis-
guised the wearer effectively. An exquisite
rose mnon dress was partly visible beneath
the Paisley. One of the smart-setters, also
hidden beneath an extinguisher, had on a
tight-fitting dress of mole velvet. A black
velvet dress of the same clingsomeness ac-
companied her.
Alfred Deakin escorted his tall young
daughter about, and theatrical stars twinkled
everywhere. Big Hugh Buckler, who is al-
ways a fashion-plater, had his pretty fair-
haired wife with him in a smart frock.
Governor Fuller seems to have sworn off
travelling in homeward-bound race specials
since he was left standing on Flemington
platform by a train which didn’t know
who he was. On Saturday the racegoers
who rushed for the first train discovered
only a gorgeous special car, with its guard’s
box and engine. Into this brief caravan
the Government House party stepped and
steamed away, while Croker of the Waist
and other stewards bowed their adieux.
State Government House parts company
on Sunday mornings, the Fullers going off
to St. Paul’s Cathedral, where the bells
deafen passers-by on the only quiet morning
of the week, while the Linlithgow pair go up
Collins-street hill to Scots’ Church, and “sit
under” Dr. Marshall, who christened brother
Charles Melbourne in the not so long ago.
The Fuller lady, after several hard laps
on Sassiety’s saucer track, had to retire
temporarily last week. She arrived from
England with a very young baby, and
straightway had to start shaking hands
at Parliament House. A rush of minor func-
tions and the Coronation flurry followed;
but she kept on till a race to Ballarat was
the next item on the programme. Then she
had to admit she was tired, and a doctor’s
“rest and quiet” decree closed her Ex.’s en-
gagement book. So it came to pass that
Governor Fuller went north to the City of
South-street alone. The hatpin sex there-
abouts was bitterly disappointed, but it had
to be. At the Art Association’s ball, the
new sub-Ex. danced with President Mrs.
Brind, and tried to smile for two, but Bal-
larat could not forgive him.
The Glassy Harem chose a bad day for its
reopening. Sassiety was mostly booked for
the Grand National on Saturday; so a lot
of people who would ordinarily have been on
the ice were on the turf. The floor, never-
theless, was fairly well covered. The ice
dressing this season is to be black velvet,
judging by the number of frocks present.
The warm, durable stuff shows up well on
the gleaming surface. Marie Hall, the girl
who will inherit a bank vault of the Ben-
digo Watson gold on her 21st birthday, was
garbed in the sleek material. Nancy Madden,
daughter of the newly-knighted, was another
in sable attire, only she added a Fauntleroy
trimming of lace collar and cuffs.
The Chinese Consul, his wife and his secre-
tary resolutely refused to dance at the Gaud
Mayoral Ball. The trio are Wesleyans—
the sect which regards leaping or gyrating
to music as the favorite pastime of the Lost.
Governor Fuller is darkly suspected of being
a Wowser, _ because, when he danced at the
same function, he seemed to jump with both
feet.
So numerous were the functions of Coron-
ation time that my pen could not race round
to all. The official ball given by Mayor
Hughes, of St. Kilda, must, however, be
awarded belated mention. It was complete
in every respect, including supper and prettv
girls, and it rolled along furiously for half
a dozen delightful hours or more. The
amber-tinted lights offered every complexion
a good chance, and if there were any people
who didn’t give three cheers as they left
they haven’t been heard of.
A horrid man writes:—
I don’t see a word in our Johanna’s letter about
the lovely revelation which happened at the Gaud
Mayoral ball when one of the plumpest and most dis-
tinguished of the dames was dancing a two-step. She
had a vice-regal aide for a partner, and in her en-
thusiasm for the mazy whirl she raised her left arm—
the train-bearing arm—higher than prudence would
have suggested. The result was a choice display of
exquisitely rounded limb in white silk stocking. It
was the penalty that plumpness pays for dispensing
with underskirts. Women seated near about, in-
cluding Lady Dudley and the Puller lady, blushed
audibly behind their fans, whilst downlookers in the
balcony enjoyed their confusion. But seeing that the
star performer was quite unconscious of her leg-
show, the G.-G. Countess gave the cue for blushing
to cease. She whispered to the other vice-regal
matron, and they broke into a forgiving smile.
An informal meeting at State Government
House last week discussed the subject of the
City Newsboys’ ball. Lady Fuller is taking
the usual vice-regal motherly interest in the
newsboys, and she made some very practical
suggestions for extracting cash from the
pockets of two-steppers. The tickets, in the
interests of sweet Charity, are usually high-
priced, and some too-frugal souls apparently
resent it. A soprano voice piped up at the
meeting and asked if there would be family
tickets —as if it were an excursion to the
seaside! Lady Fuller sweetly remarked :
“We are not organising this dance for plea-
sure, but to make every penny we can.”
Mrs. Professor Peterson and her choir of
women killed two birds with one song last
week, a newly-elected president being hon-
ored, and Bandmaster Sousa farewelled at
one and the same time. The conductress
made a warm-hearted speech of welcome to
Mrs. Harper, who has taken the vacant chair
of Lady Carmichael, departed; and Mrs.
Harper, with her arms full of presentation
vegetables, replied gracefully, and said that
she wanted to be an active head and lift up
her voice in the choruses. The white-robed,
hatless choir listened approvingly to the hon-
eyed remarks, to which Sousa in his turn
contributed. Then it uprose and sang
various melodies, including a quaint abori-
ginal chorus in the kindergarten manner.
Pianist Leonard Borwick, who has been
spell-binding audiences in the Town Hall, is
an unassuming man with pale blue eyes
and hair cropped close in the basin fashion.
He creeps on to the. platform like a mouse,
and_ starts to play brilliantly without am'
preliminary canters up and down the key-
board. On the first night his interpretations
so roused some of the musical people that
they could only express themselves by stand-
ing on their chairs and waving hankerchiefs.
The average critic reverently hands him
sugarplums of praise for breakfast, and the
general opinion is that he earns them all.
At his recitals, the seats under the gallery
hold the intensely musical section, who wait
for tedious hours, after a successful early-
door rush, armed with nothing but a block
of chocolate and a sheaf of the old masters’
notes. In the front seats, as usual, the
motored take their classics in comfort, with
a judicial after-dinner air, and wonder if the
star can be captured for high tea on Sunday
evening. The Thursday afternoon recital
drew a mostly fur-muffled audience, in which
the stage was well represented.
Nellie Veitch was at home on Saturday
night to a hundred or so friends. The guest-
in-chief was Ethel Irving, who brought with
her Mr. E. Irving Porteous and Mr. Leading-
man Ewart. The visiting star and the hostess
are mutual friends of Genevieve Ward. At
supper Gaud Mayor Davey toasted them both
and each replied for herself. The party
filled two comfortable, fire-lit rooms, and
tenor Kirby, with the order presented to
him by Queen Margharita of Italy pinned on
his coat lapel, sang a few trifles from
Puccini’s operas, to the accompaniments of
Mrs. Cooke. Miss Winkelmann, baritone
Collier, and Amadio of the flute also con-
tributed. The only amateur performer was
Dr. McAdam’s pretty daughter Beryl, who
drew a capable bow across her violin. Mrs.
MeAdam and Mrs. Major Patterson helped
in the hostessing. Miss Irving’s dress was
royal purple, with a fichu of ninon, and a
purple fillet in her hair. Nellie Veitch wore
white silk and turquoises.
“Why, I haven’t seen you for ages !” This
sentence was repeated 35,487 times at the
first reunion of the Loreto Past Students’
Association, at the Austral Salon, last
week. It was a searching but good-
humored female stocktaking, and a
bureau of information regarding mar-
riages, engagements and so forth. Rita
Hope, Roy Cook and Violet Somerset con-
tributed to the programme, and Unie Russell,
besides reciting from Dickens’s Christmas
Carol, stage-managed some effective tableaux,
in which Bertha Collin, Lyle Christian,
Eileen Deegan, Norman Mayes and several
infants of tender years posed as the Cratchit’s
family party.
At a suburban Bachelors’ Ball of much
tonnage the other night, none of the dancing
belles attracted so much attention as the lady
who sat around in a large coat, and was in-
troduced as the wife of an otherwise married
man. Everybody talks of this startling
social incident as one of the “warmest”
things that ever happened in a suburb where
the influence of Mrs. Grundy seems to have
fallen to vanishing point.
The Art Students are preparing for their
Persian Ball, to be held on Friday, July 7.
Many strange garments are being built, and
the shade of Omar is expected to be present
—if it doesn’t drop in at a wine-cellar on
the way.
One night last week the supping owls of
a Collins-street foodery had some excitement
with their coffee and cigarettes. A lordly
youth, who drives the biggest motor and
smokes the fattest cigar in Melbourne, was
inside with the crowd ; his out-size in cars
reposed unattended by the kerb, as the owner
is his own engineer. All was right enough
until a well-known man strolled out of the
place and collided with two strange females.
They smiled radiantly on his apologies, and
he mischievously invited them to go for a
ride in his juggernaut. They readily ac-
cepted the offer. He assisted them in, and
then he excused himself while he collected
his friend. In a few minutes out came the
rightful owner with his party. The party
recoiled horror-stricken from the two fe-
males, while the owner fiercely ordered them
out. But they refused resolutely to budge.
The argument proceeded and a sizable crowd
had gathered round, when a policeman ap-
peared in the distance. That settled it. The
damsels fled.
Melbourne just now is hot on the subject
of paper-bag cookery. Every woman who
cooks with enthusiasm has a regard for paper
coverings laid flat either above or below
special confections; and the paper-bag idea
is an extension of the protective principle.
The idea is to cook, not isolated dainty
dishes, but complete dinners in specially pre-
pared bags. Like most new things, it is
quite old, and various city chefs who have
been interviewed amidst the steam admit
they. occasionally cook en papillotes with
delicious results. Experimenters will pro-
bably brew disaster if they commence with a
stew and use as covering the cast-off en-
velope of the last two pounds of sugar sent
from the grocer's. A brisk demand for the
special sort of bags required has set in, and
a local firm of paper manufacturers has set
out to supply it; so every woman will soon
be able to attack the problem fully equipped.
The great Maryannless section are rejoicing,
as the bag system, if successfully worked,
means no greasy pots and pans.
R. S. Smythe is out of hospital after un-
dergoing ah operation. It was hard luck
for a man who had reached four-score
without any illness beyond the mumps
and measles of childhood to be delivered into
the surgeon’s hands at last. After the ordeal,
the Much Travelled received an invitation
to a smoke night. He sent in reply this gay
little message of regret: “I could come, and
I would, only that your other guests might
fancy I had been playing football against
Carlton.
The sad death of Edith Muntz will be
mourned by the many Melbournians who knew
the clever girl who did so well at the Uni-
versity. She was the daughter of the late
Thomas Muntz, civil engineer, and had just
returned from a round-the-world trip with
her artist-sister, Mrs. Muntz-Adams. The
l° n S journey was undertaken after a severe
nervous breakdown caused by overstudy. She
appeared to be well on the road to health
when she arrived home the other day; her
death, therefore, came as a severe shock to
her friends, who had thought that the time
tor anxiety was past.
Australia has just lost its other Tom
Price. The two —one a Premier, the other
a Colonel—were as unlike as men well can
be; and the gentler one died first. Colonel
lorn—the “Fire low and lay ’em out” of old
strike days—had long been very sick, and
his name had dropped right out of late.
_ Times are changing. Nowadays even a
bishop may be suspected of not being a Right
Thinking person. Accordingly a private
word comes across the Strait from Tasmania
that, though everybody expected Bishop Mer-
cer to be first chairman of the little island’s
first Wages Board—in the boot trade —some
of the influential employers mutter their mis-
givings; and, as the Bishop thinks there
should be unanimity, the chances are he will
not allow himself to be nominated.
Mrs. Essie Perrin-Kcrouse and her hus-
band have returned from snow-capped Buf-
falo, and solemnly declare that they found
it colder than Switzerland. One of their
meal-time diversions was chipping off bits of
frozen salads. One day the 14st. husband
tried to walk across the frozen lake without
skates. When he was some little way from
shore, the ice-film caved suddenly, and the
tail fair bride on the shore thought she
would have to order mourning. Fortun-
ately, however, the water was not a hun-
dred fathoms deep, and the 14st. bridegroom
was able to swim or walk out.
A notable drinking fountain was formally
conferred upon Melbourne last Saturday,
and a string of flags waving across the inter-
section of Bourke and Russell streets pro-
claimed the event. This time the fountain
was not another Boer War memorial, but a
monument to the glory of one Mr. Ferguson,
who appears to have been—if he is not still
—a hard-working sec. of the Total Abstin-
ence Society. The memorial tablet leaves
one in doubt as to whether Mr. F.’s services
to the Cause in the past are being continued
m the present; but the monument itself is a
tall, unquestionable fact —a brown sandstone
pillar on a substantial grey granite pedestal,
rather _ obstructive to traffic, but less un-
sesthetic than the cabmen’s shelter standing-
further down Russell-street.
One supposes that Mr. Keast, M.L.A.,
voted his very best vote against the new
Victorian land tax, but clearly he doesn’t
suspect the Federal tax of ruinous effects
upon the country at large. And, being in
the real estate business, he ought to know.
One of his latest transactions is the pur-
chase of the Newmarket Station, of 22,000
acres, near Hay (N.S.W.), where son
Stanley will have scope for growing large
crops of sheep and other vegetables. A
frontage to the Murrumbidgee promises a
guarantee against drought, though that
river, to be sure, is apt to become rather
like a ditch in dry seasons.
From “Rosna,” who has been in London
helping George It. choose a hat:—
Musical Australians are conspicuous in London at
present. Last week small Alma Moodie, the Queens-
land fiddler-child, gave a recital, with a committee
and patron list a mile long, beginning with Princess
Louise, and including no end of Viscountesses and
Marchionesses. The new G.-G. Denmans lent their
town house and shouted tea. Katherine Goodson,
Hugh Peyton and Lady Tree helped, so no wonder the
prodigy scored a big attendance. The critics agreed
about her extraordinary talent and surprising confi-
dence.
Mrs. Doubleday is in London, and daughter Leila
arrives next week from Vienna to make her London
debut in a recital with orchestra at the Queen’s
Hall on June 9.
The Titian-haired Adelaide girl, Daisy Kennedy is
one of the seven favored fiddling pupils of Sevcik,
and her exalted maestro thinks so well of her that
he brings the bud to burst in London in July. One
also hears a good deal about the Victorian pianist
William Murdoch. Clytie Hine the pretty Adelaide
soprano, has secured another scholarship at the Royal
College of Music, and is already coming in for occa-
sional engagements. The change in her appearance
is wonderful. The frail girl has grown into a bright-
faced maiden, full of rose-bloom and energy.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
For months past we have heard of the pending
removal of Government House to Torrens Park •
present Government House was to be handed over
to the University, which is sorely in need of more
elbow-room. Now everything is off. Premier Ver-
ran said so in the House on Wednesday. lie gave
two reasons-d) the price for the new place was too
stiff, and (2) the Torrens Park premises were un-
suitable, anyway. So we are saved the agonv of
pursuing our dances and dinners into a remote fast-
•i,Talking of Government House, Lady Bosanquet is
ill, and will be unable to fulfil any official engage-
ments for 10 days or so. Presumably she is suffer-
ing the effects of the recent season of gaiety.
• I rh « Bl ; ol i ffh:,ni Pl ace Congregational Church burst
into floral finery on Wednesday, in honor of the Reid-
Ividman wedding. The bride is one of the cattle-
man s girls ; the other principal party is a son of
Malcolm Reid, a timber-man. The bridesmaids’ color-
note was mauve and primrose, while a small page in
ck velvet added a dash of more sombre tinting
After the indispensable items at Brougham Place the
whole party moved on to the South Australian, to
toast the actors-m-chief. By the way, a par. by a
country scribe, in a contemporary, winds up a de-
scription of three local weddings with the cryptic sen-
tence: “Measles have broken out to make things
more lively.”
Speaker Jenkin Coles is also ill, so ill that, for the
first time m 21 years, his seat in Parliament knows
hun not. Indeed, the week as a whole has been a
drab one. John Downer (eldest son of the Downer
Knight) was to have been married before this, and
his friends were shocked to hear of his death on
i hursday. It was known that he was ill, but there
were hopes he was on the mend—so much so that Mrs
Edmonds (his cousin and his fiancee’s sister) gave a
dance only last week. And then there was Mr. John
Chnstison, who died suddenly at Clare. Since his
breakdown in 1907 Surveyor-General Strawbridge
had been more or less of an invalid, and his death
on Sunday came as no surprise. Mr. E. M. Smith,
who is to be appointed in his place, has for years
been a pillar and warden of St. Peter’s (Anglican)
Cathedral. A wide circle of friends was shocked, too,
by news of the tragically-sudden death of Mrs. Geo’
Dempster, the young wife of a popular Stock Ex-
change man. She was one of the north-country
pastoral Gebhardts, and had been married only just a
year. A baby girl died with her,
A small girl who had the bad luck to be born on

Tattersall’s Cup Meeting on Monday (the first time
the race has been cut away from the Easter meeting)
had the luck of a perfect day, and the committee
reaped a corresponding harvest. Femininity ran to
tweeds and tailor-mades. The more one sees of the
half-yard skirt the more fearsome an invention it
seems, and if the would-be smart dresser could see
herself as others see her walking up the grandstand
steps, she’d mend her ways, and her modes.
The cottage at Dingley Dell, in the sou’-east,
where poet Adam Lindsay Gordon used to live, is
still in existence; and the Poetry Recital Society
has begun an agitation to get the Government to
buy and preserve it. I can’t say that the society
has received any furious encouragement so far.
The city garden scheme advances apace. Till now
the long narrow strip at the eastern end of North
Terrace has been Government property, and has
barely justified its existence. Now the city corpora-
tion is to take the ground in hand, and has an ex-
tensive scheme of landscape gardening in view. The
approach of the Angas memorial and Edward VII.
statue calls for some re-arrangement of existing lay
figures; so Venus will be removed from her prox-
imity to the national memorial and Government
House gates, and placed nearer Bobby Burns —-who
has not been heard to complain.
We’re the proud possessor of the lady who sampled
the first chloroform. The lady in question is a niece
of Sir James Young Simpson. In the days when he
discovered the ancesthetic, she (then aged' about 10)
and the rest of the family used to look upon the
sniffing of chloroform as a kind of game. Miss
Simpson’s niece is, in her tarn, a nurse, so evi-
dently a desire to heal the sick runs in the family.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

A HAIRDRESSER’S EXPERIENCE.
“I have repeatedly used Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy, and always depend upon it to give me re-
lief when suffering from colds,” writes Mr. A. B.
Fry, Hairdresser, Gawler Street, Mount Barker, S.A.
‘‘My first experience with it was when I had a severe
attack of bronchitis. It fixed me up in a few doses.
I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone
suffering in a like manner, as it is a thoroughly
reliable remedy.”*
A RHEUMATIC
CRIPPLE.
Tells How He Banished
Suffering and Pain.
Could just drag along —Cured by
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.
■ -%•
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are recommended
to Rheumatic sufferers with confidence, be-
cause they have cured hundreds of cases of
Rheumatism. That is the greatest test any
medicine can have —-the ability to cure. Mr.
C. Shanahan, bootmaker, of 67 Buckingham
Street, North Richmond, Melbourne, was
so badly attacked by Rheumatism that often
he could hardly drag one foot after the
other, and the weight of the bedclothes was
sometimes agonising to his aching muscles
and joints. Mr. Shanahan’s story, given in
his own words, will be of interest to anyone
suffering with Rheumatism.
“I could not make it out at first,” he
said, “but I noticed severe muscular pains
coming into my legs from the feet to the
knees. I got worse attacks as time went
on. The attacks might go away for a week
or so, or appear for a few days, but once I
was laid up for five weeks, in bed most of
the time, and unable to go out, and then I
was attacked in arms and shoulders as well.
I was always freer from the pain in winter,
but I dreaded the summer, for I always suf-
fered then. The perspiration would run off
me with the pain. I felt every change in
the weather. There was no sign externally,
but the muscles of the legs would feel as if
they were being all drawn up and twisted.
1 was always having the parts rubbed with
liniments, but I could not find any relief. I
could not bear any heavy bedclothes, the parts
were so sore and tender, and the warmth
always made me feel worse. I would lie
awake afraid to move. 1 was afraid for
anyone to come near me. When the attacks
were on me I dreaded the least touch. My
legs were so stiffened that walking was most
painful. I would just drag my feet after
me, and I dare not put them on any cold
surface. I might feel quite well one moment,
and perhaps the slightest change of weather
would bring on an attack. I would have to
get up and walk about if I had been resting
awhile, and, again, if I had been walking
home very tired I would have to go and lie
down. I am glad to say that a course of
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills took the complaint
right away. lam only too glad to give this
testimonial to help any other sufferer. This
remedy cured me, and I have not had any
sign of the Rheumatism since. My limbs are
as supple as could be wished.”

POLITICAL
HIS TASTE—POLITICAL.
THE BARMAN : “I see by the papers that the
majority of the Labor party are teetotalers.”
P. E WTER: "Meself, I favor sh (hie) Liberal
measure sh. ”
Provision made on the business paper of
the “Liberal” conference, held at Sydney:
“That all Labor seats should be contested by
staunch Liberal candidates at next elec-
tions.” No doubt a misprint for “paunch.”
Those croakers who averred that the Com-
monwealth could never man a nay, and
that the Australian didn’t take to the sea,
have got a backhander in the fact that the
3000 naval cadets whom the Defence author-
ities asked for promptly offered themselves;
also the offers came not from one or two dis-
tricts, but. from all round the Common-
wealth, and the requirements were filled
three times over. Obviously the lads trust
the administration to provide decent treat-
ment, decent pay, fair chances to rise, and,
of course, absence of yellow, brown or black
competition. When the mercantile marine
guarantees its lower-class employees as
much, it also will probably get all the native-
born sailormen it needs.
W. A. Trenwith has intimated to the Vic.
Liberal caucus that he wants to contest a
seat against a Labor candidate. In Tren-
with’s case, the cobbler hasn’t stuck to the
last. He has, instead, attached himself to
the Lost.
Jenkin Coles, Speaker of the S. Aus. As-
sembly, had last week to cease piling up his
world’s record any higher. Elected Speaker
a trifle over 21 years ago, he had never
missed a sitting of the House —till Wednes-
day, when Parliament was opened with him
in bed, and the doctors resolutely blocking
his desire to be present and chance the con
sequences.
“Con. I). O’Bolin,” from the North Coast:
In connection with the N.S.W. North Coast rail-
way, far-sighted officers saw the day afar off when the
traffic could not be manipulated on a single line, so
they provided that the tunnels should be wide enough
for a double set of rails. Good; but the contract
for the first section stipulated that the Wallarobba
tunnel, between Maitland and Dungog, should be
only wide enough for one line. All the other tun-
nels right to Grafton will be double. The leaving of
one narrow hole amid a number of wide ones, is, no
doubt, capable of explanation ; but at present, in the
absence of the explanation, it strikes the North
Coast man merely as a good joke.
“Norroy” sets the fireworks right:—
Numerous illuminations made a grievous mistake
with their “Long may they reign!” Queen Mary
does not reign. She is only Princess Consort, as
Albert was Prince Consort. Though called Queen,
she is not Mary 111. There is Mary 1., daughter of Henry
VIII., and there is Mary 11., who had the help of
William ; but though it was “William and Mary,” it
is not “George and Mary.” By the way, there is an-
other Mary, a German Princess, who is called Mary
111. by the handful of Jacobites, descendant of the
Stuarts. Our present Mary is, certainly, an heir to
the Throne but far removed. Strange to add, an-
other heir, ; till farther removed, is a German Prince
descended from Jerome, King of Wurtemberg, Na-
poleon’s brother.
A note from the Gallery:—
They’re still at it down below in the N.S.W. As-
sembly, and if a young and inexperienced policeman
had the right of entry, I’m doubtful if there would
be a quorum after he had finished serving sum-
monses for “language.” I’ve had a good few years
in this Gallery, and I’m getting’ used to it now —far
better than I was in the week of my first appear-
ance, when an hon. member looked up at me and
informed me in a loud voice that he would “pull
my windpipe out!” He mistook me for some-
body who had allegedly misreported him. Since
then I have heard members say things that would
probably get a man in the street a serving of hard
labor—things that even the Watchman wouldn’t
print. Young men, old men—they’re mostly all the
same in their standard of politeness. Even old
“wire whiskers” Lonsdale has taken to calling out
“liar” and “cur,” and looking for fight. “You are
the filthiest fellow in the House,” said one gentle-
man to another a few nights ago. Maybe; I duhno.
The smell of decayed language is too general.
The “confiscation” gag so persistently
used in connection with taxes on unimproved
land values is about the drollest thing in
Tory politics. All Government levies on pri-
vate possessions are confiscation. Income
tax and probate duty are
confiscation. Jewellery
valued at £5OOO may
change hands by testa-
mentary bequest 10 times
in as many years, and
the death of each succes-
sive, owner of the gew-
gaws entails payment of
probate duty on his lega-
tee. Yet the taxing of
those values is never
called “confiscation.” The
wearisome old gag is
confined to the woes of
landowners; and they
needn’t be taxed if they
don’t want to be. No-
body compels them to
own the earth. They can
sell it and bury the money
and live on £2 a week,
exempt from all taxation
whatsoever, if they wish it.
The more or less strenuous people who
want to advance Willie Watt to the Vic-
torian Premiership offer him this text: “Be
not Weary in well-doing.”
Opposition-leader Peake, of S. Aus., is
trying a No-Confidence motion just to make
sure where each member is. There are 21
Labor members in a House of 40, so there is
not much doubt as to the result.
Allen Taylor, having achieved his title,
has given notice that he will not accept re-
election as Gaud Mayor of Sydney next
year. The Labor vote in the City Council
is now almost strong enough to decide the
mayoral election, and after the next general
poll the withdrawal of Allen Taylor will pro-
bably mean that Sydney will have its first
Labor Mayor, as well as its first Labor
Premier.
It was given out at a recent Melbourne
meeting of the Federated Iron Workers’ As-
sociation that local employers were bringing
to Victoria a noted American strike-breaker.
The mission of the incoming wrecker is to
make the Free Workers’ Society an effective
weapon in the hands of the employers. The
manager of a Melbourne bank is the accepted
grand panjandrum of the Free Workers’
Society—which makes it plainer that the
society is just as “free” as any other ass that
tows a capitalistic apple-cart.
In S. Aus. the metropolitan seats in the
Assembly are all held bv Labor; and the
disgusted Register has started to try to
pull one or two out of the fire. It wants to
“revolutionise the electoral machinery by
the application of science,” so as to “en-
sure the full representation of the people.”
What, of course, the Register really wants
is the representation of the metropolitan
Tory minority, so that, added to the country
Tory vote, the minority of the whole people
may have a majority in the House.
With more than usual violence and ver-
bosity, Melbourne Argus accuses the Labor
Government of disloyalty, or something of
the sort, because of the “shabby and mean
display” it made in the way of fireworks the
other evening. But if “loyalty” is to be
gauged by the number of colored lights a
person hangs out, just where does the Argus
itself come in? On Coronation night (he
Age office was brilliant, and the Heralp
building was ablaze ; but the Argus’s dis-
play, carried out on a scale of lavish inex-
pensiveness, consisted of a small “G.R.” and
a thrippenny crown.
The land hunger is still very keen in S.
Australia. Recently 130 blocks near Tail-
em Bend were thrown open, and there were
786 applications for them. Tailem Bend is
on the fringe of “the desert,” down near the
Murray mouth ; but that apparently is the
best S. Australia can do for its hungry
young men, who can’t pay the appalling
prices which Fat demands for his fertile
sheep walks within a hundred miles of
Adelaide.
HELPING HIM TO A DECISION.
The Daily Telegraph hints at a Liberal-Labor
coalition in the N.S.W. Parliament. On the other
hand, the S. M. Herald predicts a slump in coali-
tions as far as Liberals are concerned.
THE HUNTER-STREET LADY: “By the way,
dearie, I 'opes you ’avent forgot how the
last of them 'mixed marriages' ended.”
Minister of Lands M'Kenzie (Vic.), join-
ing in a demonstration over the arrival of a
batch of Irish damsels who are to make
shirts in Melbourne, told the colleens: “You
will earn enough here to be independent of
matrimony.” The colleens did not seem to
rejoice at the prospect. A healthy girl has
to be earning more than 255. a week before
she loses the desire to have somebody else to
earn it for her. Anyhow, the sentiment is
wholly unsound, and implies that singlets
are of more consequence than triplets.
The policy of the Verran Government
for the new session of the S. Aus. Parlia-
ment includes Adult Suffrage for the Coun-
cil, Workmen’s Compensation, Early Clos-
ing, Land Values Taxation, a Bill to better
secure the purity of food and drugs—
mostly measures passed in previous sessions
by the Labor majority in the Assembly, and
either thrown out or mutilated by Toryfat
in the property Chamber. In addition to
making bricks, the Labor Government has
an idea of organising a fuel business, on
account of the rapacious clawing of a pri-
vate combine.
“O.”: The other week, N.S.W. Minister
for Public Instruction Beeby increased the
pay of 3A assistant men-teachers who were
married. I wasn’t married. But £l2 is an
immense amount of money to a 3A assist-
ant. So I persuaded a lady to come along
and help me get it. I don’t know whj
Beeby did what he did, because I don’t work
any better than I did before I got the extra
£l2; so I can only put it down to the Labor
party’s well-known prejudice against the
marriage tie and its notorious determination
to break up the home.
Asked in the N.S.W. Legislative Council
if the Federal Parliament had not given a
vote to inmates of State charitable institu-
tions, ex-Solicitor-General Garland snorted:
“Judging from the result, probably they
did.” The snarl comes ill from a man who
has had Jock Garland’s luck. After being
biffed by three Parliamentary electorates, he
was pitchforked into the nominee Chamber,
which is the Parliamentary charitable insti-
tution, and presented, not with a mere vote,
but with the fat billet of Solicitor-General,
at a handsome salary, contributed by the
same taxpayers who help to support the less
fortunate “failures” who have been pushed
into the non-Parliamentary almshouse.
The N.S.W. Labor Government managed
to squeeze its Industrial Arbitration Bill
through its second Assembly reading without
the help of the Storey “independents.” The
chief opposition to the measure is on account
of the inclusion of rural workers in the sched-
ule. The “Liberals” lay down the princi-
ple that the “great primary industries” can-
not afford the benefits of industrial legisla-
tion. Nevertheless the Liberal party in-
cluded the shearing industry in the Act
passed last Parliament. There is no logical
reason why the man who drags milk out of
a cow r should be denied the benefits afforded
to the man who drags wool off a sheep. But
it happened that the organised shearing in-
dustry is strong enough to obtain protec-
tion, while the rural workers are not. So
the -‘Liberal” party naturally only offered
protection to the strong, and let the weak
slide.
H. D. Morton, putting in a word in the
N.S.W. Assembly for tiie dreadful person
who drives the little slaves of the Cow, said
that the- Scotch farming commissioners only
made a hurried examination. That is true;
if they had had more time they could have
found out more horrors. They might, for
instance, have heard this wail of a Williams
River cow-king: “I can’t carry on if the agi-
tators get these high wages. I’ll give up
dairying, for I’d never pay 30s. a week to
any man for milking. I have a hard
enough struggle to make things pay now.”
And then they might have found out at the
factory that that grumbler's cream cheque
ran to £6O a month, that he had three State-
school boys doing the milking and separat-
ing, and that one received a munificent ss.
per week and keep, while he was actually
receiving £1 a week from an open-hearted
Department for the maintenance and edu-
cation of the other two. It is scandalous to
expect men like that to pay wages at all.
The S. M. Herald mourned the other dav
over another foreign land-investment co*
which was appalled to find that it hadn’t
earned as much as the land tax came to.
Well? If John Fairfax and Sons had a
printing machine that didn’t do one-fifth of
what it ought to do, wouldn’t John Fairfax
and Sons take steps to force it to either do
a fair thing or give place to some other
machine that would?
Labor-leader Bath, of Westralia, is nosing
out what smells like a pretty bad scandal.
He alleges that it is almost as hard for a
legitimate selector to get a prompt selec-
tion from the local State Government as it
is for him to crawl through a camel’s eye.
The result is that the would-be selector is
encouraged, and in many cases forced, to go
to some blood-sucking middleman, who, hav-
ing large areas in his maw, disgorges a trifle
at a price that means long, up-hill drudgery
for the newcomer.
The Sydney daily press has shoved the re-
port of the Decentralisation Commission,
“which didn’t appear to consider Sydney,"
into the darkest drawer of the editor’s table
after a very brief and passing attention. But
the soul-stirring matter of Government
House is still good for columns. It is a
grim illustration of the ideas of value on the
part of the drapery-shops’ organs: (1) Self,
(2) Sydney, (3) the Ma State, and, if no :
thing else is doing, (4) Australia. Generally
something else is doing.
N.S.W. Works Minister Griffith is on a
good wicket in the Bill he proposes for stan-
dardising land-valuations throughout the
State. A valuing department is to be estab-
lished, to consist of independent experts who
will work on a scientific and harmonious
plan, and the results of their labors will be
available for such purposes as Federal land
taxation, municipal and other rating, crown
land reappraisements, etc. This will knock
on the head the self-valuation of squatters'
lands : —achieved by the simple process of first
electing nominees to shire councils, and then
inciting the nominees to elect their nominee
as town clerk. A low valuation in such
cases means a high endowment; so they rake
it in with both hands. If Griffith’s law is
passed, it will cut this business out by the
roots, and the public will begin to get a
square deal.
IN THE CRYPT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In keeping with the permanent organisation of
the party, the N.S.W. Liberal Association now has a
permanent home more worthy of its objects. The
rooms in Pitt-street have been remodelled more on
the lines of a club, to Which Liberals may betake
themselves for information, recreation and social
intercourse. Members will soon have a comfortable,
well-stocked library, and a full set, etc. r |k. etc. —
Solemn News Item.
“This way! This way!” the old man cried;
My sleeve he tightly gripped,
And from Life’s busy, roaring tide
Dragged me to see the crypt.
Between two massive plates of brass
I glimpsed a stair of stone.
“Down here,” I mused, “the dead folk pass,
And mourners sigh and groan ! ”
He like a spider dragged me in
That chilly place of tears ;
The city’s deep, incessant din
Came faintly to my ears.
When half-way down the dusty stair
I saw a slab. “Alas!
What wight unnamed is buried there?”
He said “It is the gas!”
Amazed, I let him drag me down
The second shadowed flight;
No longer could I hear the town
And there was little light.
“Come in! Come in!” he whispered low.
Some bowed, white-bearded souls
Were sitting in a silent row
Perusing printed scrolls.
Sad, rat-like rustlings filled the tomb,
As hopeless leaves were turned ;
Like lions’ eyes within the gloom
The yellow grave-lights burned.
“Whose vault is this?” I asked my guide.
“Don’t make that loud hubbub!”
He pleaded faintly at my side;
“This is the Lib’ral Club!”
I broke from him and up the stair
To Life and sunshine sped,
For I am young and cannot bear
Communing with the dead.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Handicaps for Melbourne and Caulfield
Cups suggest that the 12 top-weights in either race
are likely to include the winner. The three-year-olds,
headed by Jacamar (brother to Poseidon) at 7st.
111 b., are at present an uncertain quantity; but the
claims of Trafalgar, Comedy King, Prince Foote and
Styria (if she be sound) are undeniable —in the two-
mile event, at any rate. For the Caulfield Cup,
there can be no questioning the pretensions of
Broadsword (Bst. 51b.). A horse that could run
second for the Futurity Stakes (7 furlongs) under
a heavy burden, and third for the Newmarket, pre-
vious to winning the Doncaster mile at Kandwick,
must be dangerous in the Caulfield Cup with Bst. 51b.
up, if he can stay the extra distance. And why not?
Thus far the form of Broadsword in Australia favors
the idea that he can at least go further than a
mile, and is as much of a stayer as Flavinius proved
himself in capturing the Caulfield prize last year.
* * * *
The G. N. Hurdle Race, for the 13th time
in succession, was captured by a nag carrying less
than list. During those 13 years only two of the
winners have carried more than lOst. And now, for
the eighth consecutive time, the winner had a com-
paratively light age, as well as a compara-
tively light weight, in his favor. Since 1903 no
“aged” animal has been fast enough. Those that
might have had pace enough have been stopped by a
crushing weight, or have been killed on some previous
occasion. Under present conditions of hurdle racing
there seems to be no hope for the good old stagers
in the biggest events. With steeplechasing it is dif-
ferent. The high-weighted veterans are still worth
considering where log fences and stone walls are
concerned ; nevertheless, a wise punter doesn’t want his
fancv horse to be too veteranish. For instance, Bribery,
a winner of both Grand Nationals, is now a 10-year-
old ; and, although the old hero has a youthful spirit
and paws the ground in his readiness to be off and
doing, he is probably a bit too far gone in the
tooth to carry 12st. 81b. to the fore next Saturday.
His illustrious brethren, Grafnax and Ripon, are two
years younger, and may for that reason only hold
Bribery safe. But this is another story.
Arquebus, from S.A., was whispered last
week as being “another York” for the Hurdle Race,
and, with only 9st. to tackle, the carefully-prepared
stranger ran up to the whisper. A trifle on the leggy
side, Arquebus is bred to stay, and the three miles
were not too far for him. He won practically from end
to end. With the light-weight out of the way the
result would have been according to the betting, for,
in spite of the warning of the Calendar, punters took
short prices about Sparkle (list. 91b.) and Obi (list.
51b.), who filled the places, whilst the other favorite,
Battery, finished fourth. Sparkle’s effort to overhaul
the leader was most meritorious, and Obi also de-
served a bit of credit for beating 17 members of the
field. Each of the placed horses was a 5-year-old.
* * * *
The S’Australian contingent at Fleming-
ton gave free expression to their feelings re the bet-
ting. They had to take as little as 14 to 1 at the
start about the “good thing” which had given no
hint of its goodness in public; and many of them
backed the gallant Sparkle at 5 to' 1, or less, for a
saver. With a “1 —2” tote in operation, they would
undoubtedly have got better odds about the winner,
whilst the thousands of backers of Sparkle would
have drawn a small but satisfactory divvy for the
second horse. Extraordinary that the public, who
provide the capital for the business of horseracing,
don’t form themselves into an Employers’ Union,
and wait upon the Government to protest against the
wickedness of being compelled to pay enormous wages
to bloated bookmakers for work which could be so
much more cheaply, honestly and quietly conducted
by a philanthropic machine.
It was a pleasure last Saturday to see
Dyed Garments, an old Sydney Cup winner, assert his
class distinction by running away with the Maiden
Hurdles. Another conspicuously good thing was
Grafton King, the tall, long-striding gentleman that
was let into the Caulfield Cup at 6st. 131 b., and looks
quite capable of giving 3st. and a beating to some
of the entrants.
* * * *
The G. N. Steeple happens at Flemington
next Saturday. At time of writing Grafnax is first
favorite in the non-published betting, and on form
he looks capable of carrying even 13st. 51b. to vic-
tory. Ripon also is a stable fancy, and he and the
Grafton horse are, as was previously remarked, two
vears less ancient than Bribery. Simple Simon and
Confide look dangerous in the lOst.-odd division, and
Squirm, Nimrod and Obelisk among the lighter
weights. If Nimrod can stay three miles over big .lumps,
his performance in the G. N. Hurdle gives him a good
chance. But, seeing that this paper has previously
mentioned Confide as a likely winner, it had better
stick to her. Her sex is against her, but the market
indications are favorable. #
Tattersall’s Club, a very strong social body
in Adelaide now, has given its new secretary, Jack
Goffage', his first chance at running a metropolitan
race meeting. With a holiday, and perfect weather,
the totalisator takings flew up to £l4,ooo—close on
double those for any previous meeting of this club.
George V., as a youngster, was identified
with a notable sporting coincidence. A gee-gee
named after him—George Frederick (dam Princess
of Wales) —won the English Derby on his birthday.
An Adelaide jockey—or, rather, boy-rider
.—has had a curious experience and an unpleasant
shock. Himself a “maiden,” and riding an outsider
in a small race with a big field, he pulled his mount,
or let it pull him, all over the course, got 100yds.
behind in a mile race, and then came with such a
rush that he landed second money and a £5 16s.
tote dividend. To his amazement, he found the
crowd receiving him with jeers, the trainer talking of
a horsewhip and the stewards severely carpeting him
for “gross incompetence.” It is a hard world.
The smug apology of the S. M. Herald
in describing the small ponies at the recent polo
tournament in Sydney: “Some of them showed ominous
dark red stains on their flanks, but they were the pick
of the polo ponies of the State, and are used to the
iab of the spur.” But if Bill the carter tried to ex-
plain to the police magistrate that the hard-working
horse which he had cruelly treated had been flogged
so regularly that it had become quite accustomed to
the lash or the boot, the indignation of the beak
would carry him to the extent of calling Bill “a
hardened ruffian” ; and if Bill got out of it with less
than seven days’ hard labor, he’d at least leave the
best part of a month’s wages behind him.
Delightful weather and two large-sized
surprises characterised League Rugby in Sydney on
Saturday. One of the unforeseen happenings occurred
at Wentworth Park, where, before the eyes of a de-
lirious crowd, Newtown, last year’s premier club,
was dealt with most severely by Annandale. It was
a great game, and fulfilled the prophecy in this
column that Annandale would be shortly kicking up
some dust. The ’Dalers have been practising com-
bination, and they unwound some lovely passing
rushes, which Newtown, unable to stop, could only
stand and gape at. Ray Norman raged like 40
heathen; he was here, he was there, he was every-
where, and his barrackers hung limply against the
fence with burst throats. Newtown crawled off,
beaten by 6 to 3. The other trouble arose at North
Sydney Oval, where the mighty were put down from
their seat, and North Sydney kicked the stuffing out
of the hitherto victorious Glebe. Perhaps it was the
sea voyage that upset the beefy ones; anyhow, at
the end of the first half, North led by 15 to 4. After
the spell Glebe woke up, and let loose all its mass
of brute strength. It was too late; and, although
they piled up points fast, the butchers could not pile
them up fast enough. Time ran out with the Hill-
men ahead by 20 to 17. The most dashing team of last
year, Eastern Suburbs, manages to get beaten now
with monotonous regularity, and Saturday proved no
exception. This particular dishing was served up by
South Sydney, before 10,000 barrackers, mostly
South’s jackals; scores 12 to 8. All the Eastern
points came from the toe of Messenger’s boot; and
had he been in his usual kicking humor, the result
might have been different. The possession of Mess-
enger has just about ruined East Sydney. The most
conspicuous thing about South Sydney appears to be
its propensity for off-side play. The referee, time
after time, had to penalise the crowd for this rather
mean dodge. Balmain has at last managed to lift
its nose from the mud and score its initial win.
Western Suburbs was the victim, and its defeat (18
to 10) gave great joy to the 3000 Balmainiac bar-
rackers who were present.
The smashing of Newtown and Glebe puts
South Sydney at the top of the competition list with
a margin of three points. The procession follows
with Glebe 10, Newtown 9, Eastern Suburbs 8, An-
nandale and North Sydney 5, and Western Suburbs
and Balmain 2 each.
Union Rugby’s following in Sydney on Sat-
urday centred its attention on the Inter-’Varsity
match at Camperdown, where the local students met a
team from Maoriland. The Maorilanders showed their
superiority at once, and scored the first try within a
few minutes. The home team pulled itself together
and let loose a series of rather fine passing charges.
But they failed to materialise, and the Maorilanders
followed up each repulse with a furious counter-
charge; so the game became spectacular. In the
second spell there was a business-like method about
the visitors’ attack that broke up the local defence,
and when the whistle blew the Maorilanders had
scored five unconverted tries to the two converted
tries of the Sydnev team, and thus won by 15 points
to 10.
* * * *
N.S.W. Rugby League last week rode over
one of the recalcitrant clubs which threatened to re-
quire an outsize in hats. South Sydney, which is
leading in the premiership, objected to splitting the
gate-money with the peds. in the professional blow-
out on the coming Saturday, and asked for an alter-
ation or —no game! The League shouldered its
spare gun and told South Sydney that failure to turn
up would mean disqualification of club and officers.
The club said: “Don’t shoot —I’ll come down!”
Maoriland Rugby Leaguers hopped off the
train at Newcastle to tackle what they regarded as
a “good thing.” Later on they left with a bare vic-
tory—2l points to 20—and a more respectful idea
of football among the coal-men.
Though the conditions, including the
“gate,” were ideal for hoofball, Melbourne’s chief
League struggle on Saturday, between South and
Carlton, panned out a good deal short of 24-carat.
Nevertheless, a furious, hard-fought contest raged,
and no man was sure of victory till almost on the
close. Both teams depend chiefly on the spasmodic,
irresistible dashes of their large, meaty men. These
plunged and charged around enthusiastically; and, as
neither side could get a controlling lead of the other,
the. 35,000 spectators indulged in a perfect wallow of
excitement. But in the last 10 minutes Skinner s
hirelings tightened their belts, and the two resultant
goals, with the 3-point lead they already held, gave
the answer they wanted. Scores: South, 80 points;
Carlton, 65. the ’Wood-’Roy riot chiefly served to
stress the myopia of the police, who are understood
to have orders to treat assaults on the field just as
they would in the street. When the bell rang, ’Roy,
with 72 points to ’Wood’s 61, was quite pleased with
' itself, but as the umpire talked of reporting several
’bailers, it may be less pleased later on. The erst-all-
conquering EsSendon narrowly escaped its third suc-
cessive defeat —at the feet of Richmond—winning by
only 10 points (57 to 47) ; and it had a lot of —er —
luck in getting even them. Melbourne kept a good
hold of Geelong, and put on an extra two goals at
the finish, landing with 67 points to Sleepy’s 55 ; and
St. Kilda swept the ground with the Students 101 to
41.
The Ass. games, the first of the series of “returns,”
proved merely replicas of the earlier ones, not
a loser being able to turn the tables .on its former
conqueror. Brunswick made a valiant effort to
get even with Port, and came within three points of
doing so —42 to 45—but the rest of the “hopeless
teams seem content to remain so. North, which was
bumping Preston about, had the cheerful experience
of learning at half-time that it was playing a man
extra. He was, of course, retired, and North s points
were wiped off the board. But that made little dif-
ference, as even then it finished with 69 to Preston s
48 • P’ran acquired 68 to Brighton’s 50; Essendon
100 to ’Cote’s 47, and ’Scray 62 to ’Town’s 35.
As matters sit, South and Essendon head the League
list with 81 games each; Carlton, ’Wood and ’Roy
follow with 7 each; Geelong owns 64, Melbourne 41,
Richmond 4, St. Kilda 2, and ’Varsity one lonely
unit, and none but the five first-named can now reach
the semi-finals. In the Ass. Essendon is unbeaten,
with in wins: P’ran has 8. North and Port 7 each,
and ’Wick 6, and four of these five must ultimately
argue the possession of the pennant, unless somebody
capsizes their logic with a heavy purse.
Through the week the South Melbourne beaks suoke
to certain unruly barrackers for Skinner’s hirelings,
desired them to hand His Majesty as much as 20
crowns apiece, and intimated that the next offender
would be ordered to assist George Rex personally with
a small hammer and a large heap of stones. #
The seven Adelaide district clubs have fin-
ished their first round; West Adelaide has not lost a
game, and South has not won one, and the others
range in a neat sequence between those extremes.
West and Port were both unbeaten till the close of
the round, when they met at last, and Port went
down badly. Norwood, which generally stirs those
two up, lost its first four matches, and has only just
started to pull up. # *
Since they formed a union, Adelaide press-
men have begun to grow a spine. On the local foot-
ball grounds no shelter or other accommodation is
provided for the men who report the matches; and
unless that state of things is altered promptly there
is going to be a blank where the enthusiasts expect
to find a thrilling account of how Brown scored 7$
off his own toe. #
During a football match at Toowoomba
(Q.), the other day, between the King’s School (Parra-
matta, N.S.W.) and the Toowoomba Grammar School,
a remarkable goal was kicked by Ross, the King s
School full-back. The ball struck the left upright
some distance above the cross-bar, rebounded to the
cross-bar, then struck the other upright, then fell
back again on the cross-bar, and finally dropped over.
Collin Bell (N.S.W.) versus Pat Doran
(Melb.) was an interesting recent fixture at Mel-
bourne Athletic Club’s Hall. The lads are in the
heavy brigade, Bell (14st. 31b.) having the ad-
vantage of Doran to the extent of 101 b. avoirdupois,
and he seemed strong enough to juggle with two
people like Patrick. The first round was devoted
to cautious inquiry; then, _ satisfied that he had
an easy grip, Bell smote his opponent in various
ways and places, and in the third Doran was down
inspecting the flooring boards for Bsec. This only
served to excite his curiosity respecting the timber,
and in round four he was in a recumbent attitude
most of the three minutes. Bell might have ended
the contention there and then, had he not flared like
an ignited vesta, losing his head in the process, and
flurrying in a demented way, with the result that
Doran began to play the saving game, and was there
after 20, having swiped Bell some nasty knocks m the
meantime. Bell, who was declared the winner on
points, will make a fair to medium fighter when he
wears a permanent ice-pack on his fevered brow.
* * * *
Pug Johnson, though said to be abso-
lutely broke, cut a dash at the Coronation, easily
eclipsing Jeffries. In fact, Jeffries is an even
worse Coronator than fighter, and his wife complains
that he did nothing but sleep in an obscure London
pub, while Johnson wore 16 suits a day and smiled
his way through the city in borrowed motor-cars.
Poor Mrs. Jeffries consequently had to see the sights
of the city with Pat Malone. So low is the negro’s
coin, that what is practically a charity match is
being arranged between him and Petty-officer Curran
at Dublin in August while the big horse-show is on.
* * * *
The booming success of the Mclnstoush
has roused the ambitions of others, and a co. has
been formed to run a stadium in the Sports Ground
at Sydney during the summer months. Its real snag
will be to procure fighters of standard quality or
international fame, if what we heard from London
lately is true. According to that report practically
every fighter worth seeing in England, America and
Prance has been tied up under agreement with the
Mclnstoush. Between a concern whose circuit takes
in Paris, London and Australia, and one whose sole
venue is the Sports Ground, Sydney, there can be no
serious competition for crack bruisers.
* * * *
Arnst and Pearce have now lodged all but
the final deposit of £2OO each, and that won’t fall
due till Friday, July 28, the day before the race.
Three ferry boats will follow the event, and, judging
by the interest already manifested, seats will be at a
premium. Followers of Pearce have awakened to
the fact that he has dished his opponents in eight
successive contests. No other Australian aspirant
for the world’s championship has, they declare, ever
done it. Therefore, he must be a world-beater. The
fact conveys nothing unless we knew by how much
Arnst could also have beaten them.
Victorian motor-boat men indulged in their
first speed championship on Saturday afternoon. The
course was from St. Kilda pier out towards the Gel-
librand, then back along th.e South Melbourne fore-
shore to St. Kilda. G. W. Whatmore and his Chal-
lenger, late of Sydney, and W. C. Oxley’s Viper were
the starters. The race was the most exciting ever
witnessed in the south. Viper got the best of the
start, but the Challenger recovered the loss, and the
two raced neck and neck nearly all the way. Near
home the Viper went out, and won by a mere three
seconds. Viper is built from an American design,
and is anything but a beauty, but with the aid of a
20-h.p. engine just managed to get there. There
are rumors of some new racers next year, and Vic-
toria has hopes of being able to challenge Sydney’s
supremacy. #
E. V. Schneider, the Austral amateur
track champion, made a second appearance at the
Festival of Empire at the Crystal Palace, London.
He showed good form, excellent judgment, and every-
thing that a cyclist could wish to show but the
ability to win some of the plated ware. Still, he
downed Leo Meredith himself in a qualifying heat,
and that’s something to write home about. Schnei-
der is a promising rider.
The Goulburn-to-Sydney cycle race, annu-
ally promoted by the Dunlop Rubber Co., for the
purpose of selecting a N.S.W. representative for the
“Warrnambool,” will take place on September 23.
As usual, it will be under the supervision of the
League of N.S.W. Wheelmen. The Saturday follow-
ing will see the Australian Cycle Traders’ 100-miles
race, and two weeks after that the “Warrnambool”
itself will happen. # # *
Another record goes by the board; an
English motor-bikist, A. E. Cutt, has cut out 2557
miles on the road in six consecutive days, in the face
of a lot of wet weather. His first day’s spin saw
461 miles reeled off, 412 the second, 428 the third,
407 the fourth, 423 the fifth, and 426 the sixth.
Considering that it is 657 miles better than the pre-
vious best, the chances are that it is not too beastly
slow.
* * * *
F. D. Walcott, one of N.S.W.’s crack road-
riders, announces his intention of making an early
attempt on that £2O and £5 ss. medal which the
Dunlop Co. is offering to the cyclist who can beat
Leon Meredith’s out and home unpaced record. To
do better than that slippery 4hr. 52min. 51 4-ssec., a
man wants all the conditions favorable, and Walcott
isn’t likely to find them so at present.

N.S.W. Lawn Tennis Association failed
for the third time, last week, to get the three to
one majority necessary in order to open the Double
Bay courts for practice on Sundays; a minority of
102 squelched the 203 who voted in favor of altering
the Constitution. Later in the week the debenture-
holders dumped a demand on the door-mat for in-
terest ; and as the demand cannot be met, there is
only the alternative to burst up the co. When that
is done a better Constitution may arise out of the
ashes. #
The billiard match between Fred Lindrum
(Aus.) and Tom Reece (Eng.), 16,000 up, dragged
itself to an end on Saturday night. The Australian
pipped Reece on the post, and won by a narrow 861,
as against his Melbourne win of 5960. When Lin-
drum ran out, Reece’s little lot was 15,139, and at
no other time in the match were the two so far apart.
Up to the last session they were so close as to raise
the suspicion that they were nursing one another. Lin-
drum let Sydney off lightly with his breaks off the
red, his biggest being 438, made with 146 consecutive
losing hazards. #
“Jobber” : The game’s to a bubble. Reece,
the billiardist, is our latest visitor, and he is
going to settle in Australia. Just like Tahmmy
Burns and a dozen others. They make me tired,
these sporty blokes. Do they take us for sand-
wiches, or melons, or what?
Sydney baseball on Saturday didn’t alter
the position of clubs on the premiership list, al-
though there were many close finishes. Lane Cove
just defeated Mosman-N. Sydney by 9 runs to 8;
Waverley crawled out ahead of Paddington by 6 runs
to 5; Leichhardt accounted for Burwood by 10 to
6; and University walloped Petersham by 10 runs to
3. The dust-up leaves Lane Cove at the head of the
premiership with 12 points, Waverley and Leich-
hardt next with 10 points, University with 8, and
the balance very much in the soup. #
After much yabbering, Christchurch
(M.L.) has been selected as the spot on which Aus-
tralasia will defend its right to the Davis Cup
against the winner of the America-England prelim-
inary tie, towards the end of the year. Champion
A F. Wilding, who hails from this speck of the
Rickety Isles, will, therefore, get a big cheer when
he gives another Australian a hand in the third at-
tempt to keep the utensil out of the foreign pantry.
RHEUMATISM.
Rheumatism is generally regarded as one
of the most difficult ailments to cure, and m-
variablv medicines are tried simply with the
hope of temporary relief. Dr. Morse’s In-
dian Root Pills have been wonderfully suc-
cessful, not by merely affording a cessation ot
the pain, but by restoring the joints to their
original suppleness. Used m conjunction
with Comstock’s Nerve and Bone Liniment,
the most stubborn cases of Rheumatism,
Lumbago and Sciatica have been overcome.
In the case of Miss King, Union-street, E ox-
ton, N.Z., related by her mother, the results
exceeded expectations. She says: My
daughter suffered acutely from Rheumatism
in the arms and hips, which caused her a great
deal of pain, especially during wet weather.
Having tried many remedies for Rheuma-
tism, all of which proved useless, she went
on suffering until advised to try Comstock’s
Nerve and Bone Liniment, which was used
in conjunction with Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. After the first bottle we noticed a
great improvement, so we persevered with
the treatment, and used four bottles m all.
when all signs of Rheumatism left and have
never returned since. I cannot speak too
highly of your Nerve and Bone Liniment,
and can also recommend Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills as a grand corrective for all com-
mon ailments.”
The Liniment is sold by all leading chem-
ists and storekeepers, or will be posted at the
same price, 2s. 6d. per bottle, by the W. H.
Comstock Co., Ltd., 58 Pitt-street Sydney.*

Determination to build absolutely the best, lowest-priced cycle on the market is
responsible for this modi 1.
In every particular it is a machine to command respect. It is soundly made, the
materials are high-grade and the finish reflects credit on the workmen who
produced it.
All fittings are British made and standard in gauge and fit. This means that should
a breakage occur it would be easy to have the broken part replaced.

Australia has been harboring still another
baronet unawares, though it might have read
his name and style in the Directory for years
past. He was Sir Charles Edward Gordon,
seventh baronet; the title dates from 1706.
There doesn’t appear to have been any rush
of Gordons to secure the barren title, for
the old gentleman who has held it lately,
but died in North Sydney last week, was no
more than the second cousin of the sixth
baronet. The new baronet is the old gentle-
man’s son; and he has a son upon whom
the glory of being Baronet of Earlston may
fall some time or other.
The murder of a European stewardess on
the P. and O. Co.’s China by a Lascar is the
latest score to be chalked up against the
cheap Asiatic seadog. Next time the victim
may be a first-class passenger. A couple of
weeks ago, the steamer Kerries called in at
Fremantle (W.A.), and the officers ex-
plained how they had to put back 800 miles
to Mauritius to get rid of the mutinous
Chinese crew. If the colored person keeps
on at this rate, shipowners will be compelled
to experiment with trained baboons. From
the cheap shipowner’s standpoint, almost
anything is preferable to employing white
men at white men’s wages.

The World’s Standard
Valveless Engine.
THE life history of a FERRO ENGINE wouill be
vary interesting were we to follow it from its
embryonic stage on the blue prints of the
designers, through the various phases of infantile
life, till It emerges from the factory to be transported
to some particular spot on old mother earth, to fulfil
its destiny as the WILLING SLAVE OF INDUSTRY.
From icy pole to torrid zone, from far-off Alaska
to Australia, the sun never sets on the “ FERRO,”
THE CURSE OF ADAM has no terrors for the
men who own them. A man must needs sweat, but
he can sweat to better advantage than by yanking a
saw, pump handle or chaffcutter. Turn these jobs
over to the “ FERRO ” ; they are built to do them.
If you do not happen to own one, get busy and
write the nearest agent, who will be only too happy
to suggest the right sweat-preventer for the job.

Stationary, Portable or Marine use:

Motor: Note that Brisbane has a roof-
garden restaurant. But that Bulletin writer was
referring to the foodery which is open at all reason-
able times; except on one day in the week the ex-
cellent Finney Isles’ roof is shut up before the even-
ing meal hour... .R.G.M.: No point in it; and the
“Jackshay” pen-name belongs to an old contributor.
X.Y.Z.: Well, here’s luck: —
Slogging in from six to six,
No wonder that I feel so sick;
Shelter none, no air to breathe, the sun so hot,
It’s no wonder that men go off their pot.
I have worked ten hours for 4s. 2d. pay
And cockie says it’s only one day ;
But wait a while, we will teach him to say
“Five bob and keep, with eight hours a day.”

S.: On the samples submitted have nothing to sug-
gest except that you should get work... .Tulloch
Ard: Thanks; but it’s too early to heave a brick
yet.... J.C.W.: You are right—it is doggerel, lame-
doggerel... .Weary One: Pale little thing. Don’t
want to discourage anybody who is “only 18,” but
hope you won’t keep out of the kitchen and neglect
the dusting in order to practise writing Isle
Float: Pity to spoil an ingenious idea by poor treat-
ment. Try again P.C.B.: No; only the one edi-
tion.... Bart W.: The Bulletin pays for what it
prints. Claims for payment should be sent to the
Accountant... .Cosmo: Stand clear... .H.D.G.: A
feeble parody....A. Gray: Sorry nothing but vague
estimates available... .A. Sleevelink (and others):
Can’t undertake to return rejected pars Dirk
Swincott: Thanks; glad to hear... .C.O’N.: Sorry,
time won’t allow of it....Ti Eitas: Unsuitable....
Sheoak: No Ira: Can’t use them Dumper:
Sunday verse Fusil: After the fearfully vague
remarks of some of the poetic first-flighters, this
sort of plain language is refreshing:—
Suddenly a small black thunder cloud
The shape of a person’s hand
Comes closely followed by rain and mist
Shadowing o’er the land.
Quinya: Horse-dealing story very dull. No
value others A.H.: Too discursive Jas. N.:
Fight poem hasn’t got a punch.... Cork: Drew you,
but found nothing in the bottle. .. .R.H.M.: Sincere,
but very feeble.. ...Judy K.: Too slight... .Belle-
rive : No casualties this time :—
SCENE IN LITTLE BOURKE ST.
In their lottery shops in narrow Little Bourke
The Orientals carried on a roaring trade,
When to their dismay one night
While their lamps were burning Bright
The officers of Justice made a raid ;
The spectators round the dens enjoyed the fun ;
There was confusion and a jabbering Chinese Din,
But the hardened men in blue
Did their duty firm and true,
They dumped ’em into cabs and run ’em in.
Wild excitement prevailed in Little Bourke,
When ticket markers endeavored to escape;
When the vast crowd did disperse
Hidden Chows did rave and curse,
And firmly barred their doors when all was safe.
....H.W. (V.): Not sufficient interest... .J.J.J.:
Sorry no points about it.. . .P. S. Alfred: Not a very
bright rhyme.... Texas: Dishing-up hasn’t been skil-
fully done... .A.E.V.: Postal experiences are fairly
harrowing, but we haven’t the space. Try another
paper.... Jimmie C.: It conveys a clear impression
of a lonely life, and we hereby add it to our series of
Plain Language Poems: —

For his tent is on a knob.
He has a chat just once a week
When his boss brings his scran,
But the rest of the time he is on his pat,
And he never sees a man.
He starts to work at daybreak
To steer his plough all day, ' ,
And cooks his supper at 8 p.m.
So I guess he has earnt his pay;
He feeds his team at half-past ten,
Once more at half-past four;
And he is hard at work at sunrise
For a lonesome day once more.
*The “boodies” referred to are the W.A. “boodie
rat” or kangaroo rat of N.S.W C.J.O.: No snao.
... G.E.S.: Might be of value to some comedian. Not
suitable for print.... Homo : Neither... .Phil R.:

rhyme with a Latin title. Resembles a Domain

Keep your head on her bosom. Don’t _ bother to
write about it Seraiah: A tract. Boil it down
thus: “Her name was Evangeline; she was be-
trayed’ ; she took in washing. Alas! how many

WOULD LIE HIKE
ALE NIGHT WITH
ITCHING ECZEMA
Terrible Sufferer Ever Since He Can
Remember. Utterly Intolerable.
Seemed Beyond Medical Power to
Cure. “My Disease Was Routed
by Cuticura Soap and Ointment.”
“I take great pleasure in praising the
wonderful Cuticura Cures. Ever since I can
remember I was a terrible sufferer of eczema,
and other irritating skin diseases. I would
lie awake all night, and my suffering was
intolerable. A scaly humor settled on my
back, and being but a child, X naturally
scratched it. It was a burning, itching sensa-
tion, and utterly intolerable, in fact, it was
so that I could not possibly forget about it.
It did not take long before it spread to my
shoulders and arms, and I was almost covered
with a mass of raw flesh on account of my
scratching it. I was in such a condition that
my hands were tied.
“A number of physicians were called, but
it seemed beyond their medical power and
knowledge io cure me. Xlaving tried numer-
ous treatments without deriving any benefit
from them, I had given myself up to the
mercy of my dreadful malady, but I thought
1 would take the Cuticura treatment as a last
resort. Words cannot express my gratitude
to the one who created ‘The Cuticura Mira-
cles,’ as I have named them, for thank
heaven there was such a miracle as the Cuti-
cura Remedies sent to the suffering world,
and now I feel as if I never suffered from
even a pimple. My disease was routed by
Cuticura Soap and Ointment, and I shall
never cease praising the wonderful merits
they contain. I will never be without them,
in fact, I can almost dare any skin diseases
to attack me so long as I have Cuticura
Remedies in the house. I hope that this
letter will give other sufferers an idea of how
I suffered.” (Signed) C. L. Green, 929 Chest-
nut St., Philadelphia, U. S. A., Aug. 29, 1910.

An odd but important case has been tried in Ade-
laide police court, a driver for a big carrying firm
being charged under the Masters and Servants Act
with simply refusing —not rudely, but firmly and
absolutely^—to handle “scab” fruit (picked and sent
down river by non-union men) from Renmark.
There was no ill-feeling between the man and the
boss, but the Drivers’ Union had ordered that the
stuff should not be helped towards a sale, and the
man was loyal to the order. The S.M. said “con-
scientious grounds” would not go in that court. So
it was 10s. and costs—£4 3s. in all.

The scheme to go in for whale-hunting on a large
scale in M.L.waters, which was recently announced by
a Norwegian co., is meeting with some protest—-which
appears to have presented itself too late'. Already
the Marine Department has granted concessions to
the co. to make use of ports in the Auckland Islands,
Stewart Island, the Chathams, and the Bay of Islands,
and whaling stations have been mapped out. The
objection that has been raised is that the whaling
industry has disastrous effects upon the ordinary
fishing" industry, the theory being that the whales
are marine sheep-dogs which drive the mobs of
aquatic jumbucks shorewards. But, as there is no
considerable fishing industry to be injured in Maori-
land, and as the Norwegian whalers will fly the
M.L. flag, the co. is generally being wished “good
hunting.”

“The Snake”: Of course there are no combines in
Australasia, and the recent collapse of the Whole-
sale Club, Ltd., of Christchurch (M.L.), proves it.
The business was started as a co-operative venture,
in the interests of the public. Goods were sold on
a very small margin of profit for about a fortnight
and the outlook was promising, when the ware-
houses took a hand and refused supplies even for hard
cash. So the directors of the boycotted firm bought
a warehouse as a going concern, and more capital
, was sought from the public on a published pros-
pectus. Just there a newspaper got busy, and the
shares, which had been rushed on the first day,
went begging on the second. Nevertheless, the
directors subscribed the money themselves, and re-
moved into larger premises. Everything was serene
until the first shipment of goods from the manufac-
turers came to hand, when the banks squatted on
top of them and refused to get off. The rest of
the story was told by the managing director of the
club after the towel had'been thrown in: “To com-
bat these tactics Mr. Alcorn and I took upon our-
selves, in consideration of the interests of all, to
guarantee the club to the extent of £6OOO or more.
We have put in our money to the last penny, and
we have lost practically everything. The whole
thing has been a short but strenuous fight between
the organised trade of the city and the Wholesale
Club.” That’s the case for the club, and when the
mail left the other side hadn’t even mentioned its
address.

“A. Kito”: A Bulletin par. (May 25) gave rates
of pay of Irish linen workers. Under the influence
of a strong greed, developed through intercourse
with a Tory uncle who has an importing warehouse
and a hatred of local manufactures, I resolved to
get some handkerchiefs at the wholesale price. I
bought two dozen, and paid Is. each for them.
Twenty-four shillings for wipes that would not exceed
an area covered by four Bulletin pages! The linen
worker got about 2d., and worked a day on them.
Retail, the handkerchiefs would be at least a couple
of shillings. There is a leakage somewhere. I
think it is the blood of the Irish.
ACCOUNTICIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 used to hate the sight of Shears,
And hurry past his shop ;
I feared he might, with bitter tears,
Hush out and bid me stop.
I hated him with all my soul;
It almost made me ill
To think —it is a reason droll —
I owed the brute a bill.
But I am frightened when I owe;
For Credit means to me
The well-soaped road down which you go
To blank Insolvency.
But Shears, whene’er by fortune ill
We met where traffic flows,
Used never whine about his bill,
But talk of further clothes.
“Well, what about another suit?”
The smiling beast would say;
It caused me agony acute—
I used to edge away.
“Come round, if you have time to spare,
And see the latest stuff.”
(I longed to catch him by the hair,
And loudly shout “Enough I”)
I never did. Upon his head
No vengeance did I wreak,
But muttered as 1 turned and fled,
“Too busy now—next week!”
Then Shears would gladly go his way,
And all the talk forget,
Leaving to me a sunless day
With dismal thoughts of debt.
Last week, by all the- gods! a horse
I’d backed for many quids
Rushed safely home, and so, of course,
I skinned the laying Yids.
Straight into Shears’ I rushed and paid
That nightmare of a bill;
Shears grumbled something as he laid
The banknotes in his till.
He lingered over the receipt;
His pen he had to pull
When writing at the column’s feet
The legend, “Paid in full.”
He did not heed my chatter bright,
And scowled when he had done;
My singing heart felt very light—
My freedom I had won.
But as he slammed his Doomsday Book,
My heart in twain was torn,
To see upon his face a look
Of loathing, mixed with scorn.
Then through my intellect immense,
This thought went creeping slow:
A tailor loses confidence
If you should cease to owe.
He honors most the well-dressed men
Who gracefully contrive
To pay a little now and then
And keep the bill alive.
The solvent wretch who goes and pays
The whole of the. amount,
Shears looks upon as one who slays
The tender young account.
N.s.w.
THANK HEAVEN THAT’S PAID.

“ THE. CHILDREN’S FOOD.”
ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will
be glad to hear of a simple and scientific de-
vice which will restore your hearing, no mat-
ter how old you are. There is no mystery
or secrecy about it; we describe it fully and
explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and
in the same way you may use this sound
magnifier as an- aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike spectacles, the Wilson Common-sense
Ear-Drums are invisible and comfortable.
You can’t tell you are wearing them. No
one else can, either, because they are not
seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them—-the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
head rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts that are so sensitive, from
cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
■ So that you may clearly understand why
these facts are true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we give an illus-
tration of one as it lies in the ear. You will
notice that The Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
o\<y
t?<9
W
o -
A <0
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow the re-
moval and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson Ear-Drum has
been chosen after years of experience as the
best adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down to the natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not
only trying to have people shout at them,
but it hurts the ear-drum. When age comes
the ear-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses its tightness, and shouting does not act
properly on it. It only makes a confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate the sound in the best spot for
perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or were born deaf, we can-
not pretend to cure you. Only a miracle
could do that, in spite of some of the absurd
claims made to-day. But if you can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may
wear the Ear-Drums day and night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children can
wear them (we have special sizes for children
from six to twelve). Even a child can insert
and remove them without the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s
single visit). This includes a pair of Drums
(they are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel
remover and also an inserter. After the first
pair is bought you may purchase a single
drum at any time for Bs., but the pair you
get at first will last quite two years. Do not
ask for a trial pair. We do not send them
out on trial, and so they are never second-
hand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent to you at once, with the
fullest instructions. Don’t delay, but have
the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

Hypnotism strengthens 4 y;oyr. memory and develops a
JwUl of iron. It overcomes • bias&Mlngss, redyes hope,
Stimulates ambition and determination to succeed, and
gives you that self-confidence which enables you to
convince people of your real worth. It gives you tjie
key to the inner secrets of mind control. It enables
you to absolutely control the thoughts and actions of
whomsoever you will. When you understand this
grand and mysterious science you can plant sugges-
tions in human minds which will be carried out in a
day or even a year hence. You can cure bad habits
and diseases in yourself or others.
You can cure yourself of insomnia, nervousness, and
business or domestic worry.
You can instantaneously hypnotise people with a
mere glance of the eye, without their knowledge, and
powerfully influence them to do as you desire. You
can develop, to a marvellous degree, any musical or
dramatic talent you may have; you can increase your
salary; you can develop your telepathis or clairvoyant
power; you can give thrilling and funny hypnotic
entertainments; you can win the love and everlasting
friendship of those you desire; you can protect your-
self against the influence of Others; you can become
a financial success and be recognised as a power in
your community.
The New York Institute guarantees to teach you
the secret of attaining all these things. It is the
largest and most successful school of Hypnotism in
the world. It is chartered by the State laws, and
carries out every promise faithfully. If you want a
copy of its free book, just send your name and ad-
dress on a Penny Post Card, no money, to the New
York Institute of Science, Department 22 11, Roches,
ter, New York, U.S.A., and you will receive it by re-
turn mail, post paid.

MR. DONALD McDONALD (the well-known writer)
describes the trip as follows: —
FOR the greater part of the journey on the Queensland coast the steamer runs between the
Great Barrier Reef and the mainland, making it one of the smoothest of the sea trips of Aus-
tralasia. The route is dotted with picturesque islands, covered with foliage strange to
southern eyes, and the boat is ever rounding headlands, streaming into fine bays and estuaries. The
famous Whitsunday Passage, between Mackay and Bowen, is extremely picturesque.”

~ Footscray, Victoria, Aus.
Dear Sirs, After an attack of pleurisy followed by pneumonia I suffered
from debility with much loss of weight, and could not regain strength. The
doctor said I was in a decline and ordered me away. I determined instead to
give Angier’s Emulsion a trial, and I am very pleased that I did so, for the
result has been most gratifying. My friends are greatly astonished at the
improvement in my appearance, and I can honestly and thankfully say that I am
better now than I have been for many years. Ido not wish you to publish my
name, but will gladly answer any enquiries that may come to you concerning
this testimonial. (Name and address furnished privately)
ANgier|£mulsioN
Angier's Emulsion is invaluable in all throat and lung affections ; also for digestive
disorders and wasting diseases. It soothes and heals the lungs and air passages,
promotes normal, healthy action of the digestive organs, and builds up health and
strength. Angier’s Emulsion is pleasant to take and agrees perfectly with delicate
stomachs. Of all chemists, 1/3, 2/9 and 4/6.

IN BANANA LAND
A king is crowned and a king is dead.
The dead one, aged 100 or so, was Jerry
Straightfinger, king of the Burnett blacks.
He was the bravest nigger of them all.
Years ago, he was giving an exhibition of
spear and boomerang throwing before a
crowd of spectators, fie skied a boomerang,
which, instead of returning, circled and
made straight for the fear-stricken mob.
Jerry rushed forward, shot out his hand and
grabbed it. He carried to his grave as me-
mentoes of that occasion a sobriquet and a
broken finger.
“Rob”: When Mount Morgan began to use
its Many Peak fluxes, people in the line of
prevailing winds got a sniff of fumes such as
the Oldest Inhab. couldn’t remember. For
miles along the ranges great forest giants have
smelt the same smell and given up the ghost
rather than smell any more. One morning’s
fumes will settle your flower garden and your
pot plants. And the water—it is like poison
in the tanks, undrinkable after one hour’s
fumigating from the big stack. Make tea of
it, and the milk will curdle and hang in clots
near the surface, like submerged rafts.
From a man who has been in the busi-
ness :
Home Secretary Appel is introducing various com-
forts into the cells of prisoners guilty of extra-good
conduct in St. Helena. Tables, chairs, books, pic-
tures and vases of flowers are to be supplied with a
view “to refining and elevating,” etc. Without de-
tracting from Minister Appel’s admirable intentions,
long observation shows that such perquisites, unfortu-
nately, nearly always fall to the cunning, exper-
ienced gaol bird, who lays himself out to win every
possible privilege by every possible hypocrisy. The
best behaved men in prison are seldom the novices
in crime. On the contrary, the first-sentence men
are often sullen and rebellious. But the downy old
veterans are alert and cunning as lynxes. By the
way, Harry Thaw, who shot Stanford White in
America, had a suite of cells. Perhaps Bananaland
may yet go in for the Thaw apartment system—
suites to the sweet.
Rockhampton seems to breed people with
an eye for cattle-flesh. In the usual weight-
guessing competition inseparable from local
shows, 19 persons correctly estimated the
weight of the exhibition bullock (8901 b.), 12
more guessed to within lib., and 50 more to
within 51b. of steak.
Governor Macgregor, at the opening of the
Salv’army’s People Palace in Brisbane, said
the Army’s self-denial fund for 1910 was
£70,000. It was simply miraculous. The
Army succeeded by its “sincerity and practi-
cal aspect, more especially on account of its
religious foundations.” Presumably this is
medical Scotch for “unblushing cadge.”
“Quan”: Some time ago The Bulletin
remarked that the sectarian devil has a hard
row to hoe in western Bananaland. He
has. Among those at a reception given at
Cunnamulla to Roman Catholic Bishop
Duhig, of Rockhampton, were the Anglican
and Methodist parsons. Twelve months
among the mulga and the saltbush would
make a different man of Dill Macky.
HE WAS A VEGETARIAN.
PHILANTHROPIST: “ Er—I sent a poor starving devil down to yon with a note this morn-
ing to tell you to give him a meal. What’s the bill?”
BUNG: “ Eighteen pence."
PHILANTHROPIST: “ What are the items?”
BUNG: “ Four beers and two cigars.”
The Denham party has decided, after all,
to nominate W. D. Armstrong, who was
Deputy Speaker during deceased “Joey”
Bell’s illness last session, as Speaker of the
Bananaland Assembly. So the hopes of a
prominent independent are shattered.
Robert Philp re his proposed retire-
ment :
He would never accept office again, and it would
be unfair to Townsville to offer himself again, as
he might deprive the city of the opportunity of
Ministerial representation.
Philp’s objection is not to office in itself,
but to office under Denham, the loyal Philp-
ite who knifed his leader in 1903. At the
same time, the ex-Premier knows perfectly
well that his political cake is dough in
Townsville. He has already a Labor col-
league, and the recent Federal referendum
vote showed Labor to possess a 300 majority
in the Philpian constituency. The time for
retirement has plainly come.
Mrs. Nash, wife of James Nash, the dis-
coverer of Gympie, was a witness in a
Gympie will case heard in the Brisbane
Supreme Court the other day. Nash dis-
covered gold at Gympie on October 20, 1867.
The place was then called Jimpy, or Gympy;
but for some time the township was known
as Nashville —just as at one time it _ was
proposed to call Broken Hill Mullinsville.
John Graeme Balsillie, who has just been
appointed first Commonwealth wireless ex-
pert, is a young Queenslander who has con-
trived to cram quite a deal of wandering
into his 27 years of existence. A Brisbane
Normal and Grammar School boy, he early
made the discovery that the surest way to
get appreciated in Australia is to live
abroad. So he drifted first to the Cold Land
and then to Russia and China, mostly on
wireless work, until, after patenting a sys-
tem of his own, Andrew Fisher thought him
good enough to have the chance of earning
a living at home.
Died at Gympie other day, Lieut.-Col.
Patterson, one of the first officers of the
Queensland Mounted Infantry—the crowd
that fell into sad disrepute during the strike
that was nearly a revolution.
Pathetic patch from the Walsh and Tin-
aroo Miner :
Permit me to draw attention to the following
facts. There is only one cart plying for hire here,
and it is used as a hearse, for carting refuse, in-
cluding dead dogs and goats, from the town. It is
also used for conveying meat from Irvinebank to the
butcher’s shop. I ask you for decency’s sake to
give this disgraceful matter publicity.
Truly a comprehensive vehicle! Dead dogs
and goats, dead bullocks and dead humans
—it refuses none of them.
“Bromide,” on cane-cutting records: —
“Stan” (B. 15/6/’ll) nominates Charlie Steve, of
Ingham, as a champion because he cut 16 tons of
trashed cane in nine hours. Supposing Steve did it,
there is nothing to write home about if the crop
was a favorable one. I’ll guarantee to produce
scores of cutters who will, in a crop of 25 to 35 tons
per acre of trashed cane, do as much and think no-
thing of it. Mere figures in such a case are not worth
their ink. What counts is the condition of the crop.
What tonnage per acre? Was it straight cane?
Short and heavy, or long whipstick cane? “Trashed
cane” means that all the dead leaves, shoots, etc.,
have been cleared away, and it is the presence of
these things in “green cane” that puts the brake
on the cutter. I suppose 95 per cent, of the crops
are cut in the “green” ; it is only when there is too
much “trash” that the cocky will stand running a
fire through it to clear it out. By all means give the
champion sheep-barber a rest, and let us hear a bit
about the white slaves of the sugar fields; but let it
be about cutting and loading green cane, and let us
know the tonnage to the acre, whether straight or
twisted, long or short, and all the other things which
have to be considered when pricing cane. As the
day’s work of the cutter includes both cutting and
loading, no entries for the championship should be
accepted from men who have merely cut and not
loaded. And, more important than all, work must
be limited to eight hours; jackass to jackass cutters
should be strictly barred.
The Man of Beezness.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears—
I come to blame not Judas, but to praise him:
A good, keen beezness man, of habits steady;
A calculator keen of odds and chances;
A trusted, trusty carl to carry bags,
And meet the dues that fell on poor disciples
Was this same Judas!
’Tis true he sinned somewhat in one transaction;
’Tis true they tell a tale of Thirty Pieces
He gained by one unhappy, so-called bargain.
But then remark his Aim !
He knew the power of Him, the Mighty Master,
Could stem the hostile tide and dodge disaster,
And so the thing was safe —as safe as houses—
And would, moreover, as he noted clearly,
Pour coin, good coin, coin that was badly needed,
Into the bags of Judas.
Why deal in blame unduly? Was he not
A fair forerunner of the bands of Beezness?
Did he not wisely buy when things were low
And sell when things were high ?
Did he not offer in the open market
The goods most in demand?
And if it pleased the High Omniscient
That One should perish on the Cross untimely,
Who then was Judas that he should oppose
And thwart the plan eternal?
And if the Thirty Pieces in'his palm
Burned like the fabled sixpences that lie
Hot on the hobs of Hades,
’Twas but a transient weakness of the flesh
Demanding Christian pity!
Why then damn Judas?
There lie in ev’ry Gentile cemetery
Scores upon scores of one-time portly brethren
Who cornered Egypt’s grain and robbed her fleshpots.
Who sold the weak and stole the bread of children,
Who flayed the needy, ground the poor to powder,
Whose doings daily crucified the Master;
And these repose ’neath many a massy tombstone
Scored with mendacious mem’ries of the virtues
The dead men never knew.
One blemish only hath this tale of Judas,
Precursor of our modern Bag and Bourse men —
He died, his neck within a noose; but now in
Beezness
Ye lay the noose on necks of other people
But never on your own; in which respect
He fajled his tribe, this much abused Judas,
And died, I fear, recanting. Of your goodness
Pray for his soul, ye brethren in the Beezness,
And for his final frailty forgive him.
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER FLAM.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, July 1, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
About 3500 of the Naicest and sub-Naicest
called in last Saturday to the Mayoral Did-
dams s reception, given in grateful celebra-
tion of the bonneting of George. The
Mayoress received in a becoming grey frock,
set off with bright-edged smiles, in a bower
of palms. The Exes, from Government
Mouse were among those who helped to wear
the lady’s glove to shreds. The affair was
the biggest and likewise the most successful
ever held here, and all the “proper” people
showed up—which isn’t the rule at Brisbane
Mayoral shows.
Mrs. Jessie Lambert Compigne, who died
in Brisbane the other day, walked hand in
hand with a lot of Queensland history during
her 76 years of life. As a child she ar-
rived from N. S. Wales with her father
(Captain Collins) and mother, and resided at
Telemon Station, Upper Logan, in the days
when black brother was a most infuriated
person, for sufficiently good reason. Never-
theless, the then young girl-pioneer fre-
quently rode the 50 miles to Brisbane and
back without an escort. She married the
late A. W- Compigne, one of our original
M’s.L.C., in ’53, and was present when Sir
George Bowen read the proclamation mak-
us a separate colony. Later, the bluff old
Gov. was her guest at Nindooimbah Station.
She remembered Brisbane when it had no
bridge, and when convicts worked in the
streets. A kindly, cheerful soul, her friends
were many, and her enemies none at all.
Another case of leprosy is reported from
that jumping-off place of the aged and halt,
Dunwich. This time it is the young of
an official, and he makes the fifth victim to
date. No explanation of the persistency of
the horror thereabouts is forthcoming, but I
am not singular in the belief that the adja-
cent leper station in Moreton Bay should be
removed with great speed and determination.
Perhaps the festive mosquito is acting as a
special experimenter in inoculation, and if
that is so, the winged agent has only
miles to go to deliver the dreadful goods.
Minister for Customs Tudor, with M.L.A.
George Barber, rushed through Brisbane last
Thursday to the North, to try to dissolve the
sugar difficulties. But at time of writing
the fatman was still sitting sullenly on the
bag, and declaring that it is impossible for
him to pay fair wages and enormous divi-
dends at the same time. And no reasonable
person can deny it.
The annual frivol of the Ninth A.I.R. was
marked by a number of antediluvian dances
that figured upon the ball programme on the
night Belgium’s capital had gathered there
her beauty and her aldermen. The officers of
the Ninth A.I.R. had a bad time manoeuvring
through the ancient figures, and I did hear
that the P.M.O had to be piloted by an ac-
tive section of the ambulance corps. One
verra Scawtch importation knew every
turn; but, then, Scotland is a place where
any old thing is carefully hoarded up for
possible use.
The consular Carters served tea and the
usual etceteras to a large throng at the
Nunnington mansion during the week, and
those who came to “scoff” remained all day.
Once it used to be the thing to sip a thimble-
cup of tea, nibble a cookie, and then flutter
to the carriage; but in these times the
bidden toy with six cups of tea (not small),
four scones, three cream cakes, four or six
sandwiches and a couple of fruit salads.
The clan Unmack was responsible for an-
other tea-party, and those who were not
satisfied were not there.
Our new Commandant and Mrs. Parnell
will trip from the mail train this evening.
A wail reaches me from Colombo, where
a timid young engagee, who flitted thither to
meet “him,” nearly had her life’s romance
shattered by a small local half-caste, who
persistently trotted beside the double rick-
shaw in which the couple were taking the
air, and claimed the gentleman as a long-lost
father. She declares that for ever Ceylon
will be associated in her mind with five
things : Tangled relationships, 1; odors of
pitch, cinnamon, kerosene, and hot nigger, a
dead-heat.
The Bulletin the other day said it
couldn’t get a roof-garden meal in Australia,
but Brisbane can at least supply it with a
mid-day lunch 80ft. above the pavement, in
very charming surroundings. The new
Finney-Isles’ “garden” is the favorite lun-
cheon resort of the moment; the only trouble
is that it is hermetically sealed, most days of
the week, at 5.30. But we are hoping to get
the 5 changed to a 9 in the future; and then
we’ll dine as well as lunch on the roof.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
There is yet hope for the North. That
famous old industry, the manufacture of
Mackay rum, is on the verge of a glorious
resurrection, and the tens of thousands of
gallons of molasses now running to waste
mav soon be converted into lovely tipple,
gorgeous visions, and serpents innumerable.
The census shows that it has taken
Queensland 10 years to incx-ease its popula-
tion by 100,000. At this rate of increase, it
will take 30 years for Bananaland to attain
its first million. Will Japan, a country
that supports nearly 50,000,000 souls on less
than one-fourth of the area of Queensland,
please be so kind as to wait a century or
two until the northern State has enough
men to make a decent resistance? Or will
vai’ious local people quit their present anti-
immigration attitude?

MYSTERY SOLVED AT LAST
NO MORE SUPERFLUOUS HAIR.
A Positive Means that takes away Superfluous Hairs for Ever.
Sydney “Bulletin ” Coupon for Readers.
No woman with a moustache,
or, indeed, with any hair disfig-
uring her face, neck, arms or
bust, need suffer this mortifica-
tion any longer. To relieve all
such unhappiness, arrangements
have been made for 1000 copies
of the complete literal;,re describ-
ing the way to permanently re-
move superfluous hair to be given
away to readers of Sydney Bul-
letin who are constantly miser-
able because of such an unnat-
ural, unsightly growth. This
literature tells how the women
of Ancient Rome kept their skins
free and clear from superfluous
hair, and how a Parisian woman
discovered the secret. You are
bound to be surprised and de-
lighted after sending the Coupon
to the ROMAN SOLVENE LAB-
ORATORY, Dept. 631 C, 85,5$rreat
Portland Street, London, W.,
Eng., but you must send this
Coupon without delay, as the
supply is limited.
RS
wm
No matter how heavy or light
the growth, it can now be per-
manently destroyed in a few
minutes on the face, neck, arms,
bust, or any portion of the body.
This is not merely temporary re-
lief, for once the hair roots are
destroyed the growth can never
return.
The Vicomtesse de Freminville,
of St. Malo, writes: “I am aston-
ished, as I have tried so many
things in vain. Your discovery,
I believe, is the real means for
removing superfluous hair, and, I
may repeat, I am delighted.”
Mile. Julie Rivaz, of De Raney,
says: “I no longer have super-
fluous hair, although before I had
a great deal. I have up to now
tried everything in vain to re-
medy it. I would not have
thought it possible to find a means
of removing so completely and
for ever the superfluous hair/’

A CIGAR IS THE BEST
SMOKE OF ALL!
But why can’t you get a
Good Cigar in the Country?
CHI
aum.
ALL over Australasia the only places you can
buy a really high-class Cigar is in the big
cities. In the country districts a good Cigar
cannot be had; because it’s only at the pubs that
you can buy Cigars at all in the out-back districts.
The publican knows that selling liquor pays him
better. He reckons that his customers only call
for a Cigar when they ve got a few drinks in and
want to dodge getting “fu’ the noo.” Any old
Cigar does for that.
So he buys a few hundred at a time from
some “back-yarder"—real “Flor de Cabbage”
with big gold pictures all over the box and
mighty pretty bands round them—made from the
waste leaf and the cheapest growths, but called
by some high-falutin' name. (The making of these
Cigars is another story—l’ll tell you about it
another time.)
The storekeeper or tobac-
conist in country towns does
not sell good Cigars either.
If he does, he has to add to
the selling price of the Cigar,
the maker’s profit, the profit
of the warehouseman he
buys from, the profit of the
traveller who calls and sells
them to him, and his own
profit.
So that a good Cigar
that sells in the city at 6d.
he’d have to charge 9d. for,
and not grow fat on it then,
because the number he would
sell would be small; and
good Cigars have to be kept
in a uniform temperature,
free from exposure to the
air, or else they'll go off.
T 1 jse are just some of
the reasons why you can’t
get a good Cigar in the
country parts of Australia,
and also why so very few
Cigars are at present smoked
in the country.
Buy a 100-box of my
DIADEMAS,” smoke 5 or
6 of them, and, if they’re
not as good as any 6d.
Cigar you’ve ever smoked,
you needn’t pay a penny.
That’s the way I’m in-
troducing my Cigars into
Australia. I know Cigar-
making from Ato Z. I know
these DIADEMAS Cigars of
mine are just the coolest,
smoothest and most luxu-
rious smoke any man could wish for. Cigar-
smokers of a lifetime say so; and the more you
know about a good Cigar the better you'll like
them.
My DIADEMAS are made from the very
finest, mild, rich, mellow, Java leaf, the filling or
inside heart of the Cigar being all straight long
Brazilian. The Cigars are hand made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before it
goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed to
burn free and draw easily. The Cigar is 4 inches
long, and the picture at the side is a copy of it,
exact in size and shape.
Now, this DIADEMAS Cigar is as good as
any 6d Cigar, sold in the cities by high-class
tobacconists, as I sell it direct to the customer—
saving the cost of wholesalers’, salesmen’s, and
retailers’ profit. I only charge you 22/6 the box
of 100 DIADEMAS, postage paid right to your
address.
Send 22/6 to-day, and get the box of 100
DIADEMAS by return post. In ordering, say
whether you like the mild, medium, or strong
grade. Please add exchange to country and
interstate cheques.

Hearrve’ s Bronchitis Cure
Leader of the Crusade against Winter Ills.
THOSE who have taken this medicine are amazed at its splendid healing power. Sufferers from Bronchitis,
Cough, Croup, Asthma, Hoarseness, Difficulty of Breathing, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful
and rapid relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure.
It is most comforting in allaying Irritation in the Throat and giving Strength to the Voice, and it neither allows
a Cough nor Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption is not known where “Coughs’*
have, on their first appearance, been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it as taken
at the beginning, si dose or two is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.

The buffering arid Pain Endured by Many Women
js Almost Beyond Relief.
THERE are thousands of Australian Women whose duties call tfieiji
out in all weathers, often to sit with vyet feet oj stand all day, thus
undermining their health. Many women, however, spend their
lives at home, and these are ambitious that their homes should be kept
neat and clean, their children well dressed and tidy, and they often do
their own house-work, and sewing for the entire family, Truly the work
of such women “is never done,” and is it any wonder that she breaks
down at the end of a few years —the back aches, there is a general
depression, and the struggle to continue her duties is pitiful ? The reason
is that the kidneys are not doing their duty. If they were, the blood
would be kept and would nourish the whole body ; but if the kidneys
are inactive the blood carries pain and disease throughout the system.
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills are the great corrective for all Kidney ills, and in
making the Kidneys well will soon
remove such symptoms as Backache,
Headache, Nervous Depression, Drag-
ging Pains, Sleeplessness, Lassitude
and other distressing ailments which
women are so often subject to.

Diseased Kidneys 8 Gravel.
“ I liave good cause to be
grateful to Dr. Sheldon’s Gin
Pills,” writes Mrs, M, Moore,
The Avenue, Croydon,
N.S.W. “ I suffered from
diseased Kidneys and gravel
for the past two years. I got
so had that I had to lay up for
two weeks, my back was so
painful. I could not sleep for
the burning feeling all over me.
To do my work was out of the
question. I was really helpless, I
tried numerous medicines and wore a
plaster for months, and I have been under
two doctors ; but they all failed to give me any
relief. One day I went to the chemist’s to get some-
thing to give me a little relief, w'hen I saw Dr. Shel-
don’s Gin Pills in the window. Being a new pill, I
thought I would give them a trial. I bought a bottle, and
after taking the contents I felt greatly relieved. They are far
better than all the doctors and medicines put together. I took the pills for three months,
and after that time I felt a new woman, and have not had a pain or an ache since.
For Backache and all Kidney Troubles use Dr. Sheldons Gin Pills.
One of those pills contains in a concentrated form all the curative properties
of a pint of the finest gin, together with other important ingredients recog=
nised by the medical profession as being remedial agents of the highest
value for the Kidneys and allied organs.
Dr Sheldon’s Gin Tills are procurable at all chemists and storekeepers in two size

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THEY took out a warrant for the arrest of
Dido Connelly, as soon as they heard
from Willalong how the job had been
done. The safe had obviously been cracked
by two men, and of these Dido was as ob-
viously one. The detectives knew his touch.
He and Piggy Blamyre had been seen to-
gether in Melbourne three days before the
robbery at Willalong post office, and so, on
general principles, a warrant was taken out
for Piggy as well. At the time this war-
rant was issued Piggy was ivell on his way
to San Francisco. Dido, not so wise, was
snapped up by one of the plain-clothes police
in Bourke-street, two weeks after the rob-
bery.
Herein did Plain-clothes Constable Smith-
wick err. Instead of taking Dido to the
Detective Office, where the experts could
“put the acid” on him nicely and quietly,
Smithwick took him to the City Watchhouse,
jjtnd there put the formal charge against
iiipi. It is true that on the way up from
Bourke-street he attempted to pour a few
drops of acid himself, but he did it very
clumsily—shook the bottle, as it were—and
the net result of his questioning was that
Dido had never seen him before, did not san-
guinary well ever want to see him again, did
not know who, or where, Piggy was, and did
not scarlet well care. Dido reiterated the
information that he did not know who Piggy
W o S by the name he ought to be a rufous
plain-clothes John- In answer to further
ouestions he invited Constable Smithwick to
depart to a red and improper Gehenna.
Dido was very annoyed about his arrest.
There was somebody else, however* still
more annoyed about it than Dido When
the star detective of the Criminal Investiga-
tion Branch heard that Dido had been locked
on and the charge formally preferred, his
remarks to Constable Smithwick were so in-
sulting that had he beep a civilian he wopld
probably have been locked up too. But this
\yas the great McMasters, and Smithwick
was discreetly humble.. .
‘‘■What the hell, sir,” asked McMasters,
“did you arrest the man for? Do you think
you are paid Bs. a day foy spoiling our
dases?'”
“But” ^ — Ipegan Smithwick-
“Bah, you ass!”' shouted the fletectiye,
and the conversation languished.
Now, to those "who understand the rules
which govern the innermost workings of pie
c. 1., it plainly appears that Detective
McMasters did well" to be angry. is not
generally known how far upon the way to
the “Third Degree” our Australian detec-
tives may go with a suspect. They may,
and they do, take him into the “Gazette
Room” at the office, and there question him
from dawn to dusk, and sometimes back
again till dawn. They bully him, they coax
him, they frighten him; they tell him that
the other man has “coughed it all up,” that
they know all about it, that he had better
tell the truth, that the telling of the truth
is always placed by the Judge on the credit
side of the ledger, when the punishment
comes to be reckoned. By these arts, and
by cross-examination, if the suspect be a
fool who will answer their questions, they
trap him into obvious misstatements, and
not infrequently into a full admission. The
ethics of this method do not seem unim-
peachable, but when one hears talk about
“British fair-play” he will do well to remem-
ber the “fair-play” of the gang of buck-
larrikins who hit their victim on the head
with bottles, the sporting spirit of the sneak-
thief who picks a poor woman’s pocket or
steals a child’s money-box. As these sow,
surely should they reap, and some of them
certainly do reap their small crop in the
Gazette Room. But —and this is why De-
tective McMasters was angry—it is only a
suspect who may be treated so. Once a man
has been formally charged at the watch-
house counter he becomes “the accused,” and
is beyond the reach of their questions.
Dido, be it known, was a man upon whom
they wished very particularly to “put the
acid.” Though they knew that he had
done the Willalong post office safe robbery,
they wanted evidence. They wanted to find
out how he had managed to get from Mel-
bourne to Willalong, a distance of nearly 200
miles, in three days, without going by train.
They wanted to obtain a “statement” from
Dido which they could confute by investiga-
tion. Unless they could do this, their case
had broken down at the very outset. A
jury will not send a man to gaol for seven
years or so because the detectives tell it
that they know this man is guilty of the
offence alleged against him. A jury, unrea-
sonably enough, requires proof—strong
proof. And for these reasons Smithwick bad
to endure McMasters’s contumely. He had
taken from the detective the chance of con-
victing Dido out of Dido’s own mouth.
McMasters got across to the watchhouse
in time to see Dido signing the “property-
sheet” at the counter, the contents of his
pockets turned out before him by his captor.
As soon as the “crook” saw the detective he
scowled, and put his hand over his mouth.
“Hullo, Dido!” said McMasters. “What’s
the trouble -this time?”
Dido kept his hand over his, mouth, but
his little black eyes snapped viciously, full
of unuttered bad language.
“Come on, Dido, you know who I am,”
said McMasters.
“No, I don’t,” said Dido. “I s’pose you’re
a scarlet John Hop. Well, Mr. Hop, you
gets notning from me. I’m oyster.”
“I don’t want to ask you anything, my
lad,” replied the detective. “You’re under
arrest. A man of your experience ought to
know what we can do.”
“I know bloomin’ well what you can do,
Mr. bloomin’ McMasters. An’ I know you
don’t not me this d—n time.”
“Thought you didn’t know me,” said the
detective, smiling.
Dido put his hand over his mouth again.
Not another word would he speak, even to
the detective’s sneers. At length, “Take him
away,” said McMasters, and both left the
counter in thoroughly bad tempers, Dido for
his cell, and the detective for the office.
On the steps of the watchhouse, however, he
met Daley, the roundsman of The Clarion.
They went down into the city together, and,
sitting in the parlor of an hotel, McMasters
spat out all the bitterness in his soul con-
cerning the blundering Smithwick.
“Anything good in his pockets?” inquired
Daley, when Smithwick had been finally dis-
posed of.
“Haven’t looked at them yet,” replied the
detective, emptying Dido’s property on the
table, where both men examined it.
“Hullo!” cried the reporter. He handed
over Dido’s pocket-book, open at a page on
which a rough plan had been drawn.
“Why,” said McMasters, “d —d if this isn’t
the plan of Willalong post office. This ought
to settle Dido. I must go and show this
to the boss at once.”
The two parted at the hotel door, Daley
to write up the poor story of Dido’s arrest.
“Say nothing about this plan,” said McMas-
ters, and the reporter nodded.
The Superintendent of the C.l. Branch did
not take the plan in Dido’s pocket-book at
all in the manner expected by his subordin-
ate.
“Take it away! Take the d —d thing
away and burn it, my boy,” he said. “I’ll
have nothing to do with it. I’ll never have
anything to do with this sort of thing. Take
it away! Good God!”
“D’ you mean to say,” snorted McMasters,
“that you think I put the blasted thing
there?”
The Superintendent chuckled. “Didn’t
you, my boy? Well, well! Now, don’t get
hot under the collar. I like your cheek,
Mac. But remember the row when Dick
Murdock put the watch in Turn Jewell’s
room, and got Turn three years for it. No,
no, it’s far too risky.”
“So help me, God” began McMasters,
but Superintendent Turnbull waved his
hands blandly.
“I’ll have nothing to do with it, Mac,” he
said. “That ends it.”
The detective met Daley again late that
night. “Turnbull thinks I put that plan
there,” he said.
Daley laughed. “Didn’t you?” he asked.
“You chaps do such funny things some-
times.”
“I’ll swear I didn’t. But it knocks the
police case in. Unless I can get the brute
to admit before witnesses that he drew the
thing, I can’t show it to a jury. You know

VSR ZAM-BUK DAILY.
CHAPPED HANDS, sore lips, chilblains and cold
sores generally are not only dangerous but annoy-
ing, and girls with sensitive skins often suffer untold
misery. In the worst cases the skin burns and smarts so
fiercely that every movement causes pain. There are cracks
at the knuckles, bleeding begins, and if the wound remains
open, cold, dirt and disease germs get into it, and festering is
set up.
Hands which suffer under winter conditions can be restored
o a sound and healthy condition by the judicious application
of Zam-Buk. This pure balm exerts a delightfully cooling
and soothing influence, and quickly renders the skin soft and
strong. Zam-Buk is the ideal skin-protector, because its
unique skin healing powers are helped by" the absolute purity
and the great antiseptic value of its ingredients.
Zam-Buk contains none of the rancid animal fats such as
are found in ordinary ointments and salves. A nightly
dressing with Zam-Buk is the ideal way to keep the skin soft
healthy and strong in winter.
CHAPS AND PAINFUL CRACKS HEALED.
“Last winter my hands rod in a terrible state from the cold ” says Mrs
Kinsley, of Clifton and Phillis Streets, Mavlands, Adelaide. “ They chapped
and craeked fearfully, and I dari d not put them in water for fear the cracks
would bleed. My nails broke away in fissures, right down to the quicks
Having Zam-Buk handy I dressed my hands with the Balm on retiring at
night and put an old pair of gloves on, and soon the cracks and painful
fissures healed up nicely, and the skin was made soft, sound and pliable."
Every Home Needs Zam-Buk
Chilblains Banished.
Mrs. A. M. Paterson, of
9 Union Street, Port Mel-
bourne, says: “Each
winter my husband and
little girl endured much
suffering from chilblains,
which would swell up to
an awful size and burst.
“Hearing of Zam-Buk,
we obtained a supply, and
dressed the chilblains
with it. Both the sufferers
were soon eased of the
irritation, and after con-
tinuing with Zam-Buk for
a short time the chil-
bla i n s were banished
altogether.”
Sore Throat 8 Chest.
In cases of sore throat,
Zam-Buk is particularly
effective when rubbed on
the sides of the throat.
Rubbing Zam-Buk well in-
to the chest, throat and
back is pleasant and most
beneficial treatmentfora
cold and “tightness” of
the chest.
Mothers who use Zam-
Buk as soon as the chil-
dren complain of sore
throat, will be amply re-
paid for their foresight.
Zam Buk is in-

‘Anyway, I’m not going to in this case,

Well, said Daley, “you’ve got three or
tour days remand, and the trip up to Willa-
Drdo, P’raps he’ll confide in you
on the way up.
Perhaps,” said McMasters.
Now it came to pass, in the fulness of
time, Dido found himself in a second-class
carriage, travelling to Willalong with De-
tective McMasters. Dido braced himself
tor questions. None came. McMasters
spoke pohtely to him on the subject of foot-
ball, the weather, the latest scratchings, and
tne latest convictions—all society talk of
ourke-street corner. Dido talked also, very
carefully, alert always for the inevitable
questions. Ihe detective was very smart,
but Dido reckoned that he was smarter,
nut the. questions never came. Dido be-
came uneasy. This easy confidence of the
detective might mean that he had sufficient
evidence without straining after admissions.
Dido bethought himself of that which he had
done, and that which he had left undone.
He remembered, of course, that tell-tale plan
in his pocket-book. The thing had not,
however, troubled him until now. How
much did this man know?
Once only did Dido notice intention in his
vv'ii rt i s ren l t ! r kf • As the train neared
uillalong, McMasters waved his hand at
the rapidly fleeting vistas of blue hills and
grey foregrounds. “Beautiful countrv!” he
said.
“I never saw it before,” replied Dido, in-
nocently. “Not bad, is it?”
The detective laughed, and Dido’s lurking
uneasiness drove down upon his mind like a
grey fog. Had that plan been recognised!
™ th . ey “P>“ehed” Piggy, and had Piggy
(following the traditional habits of his
namesakes in danger) squealed? Had the
tec. traced his movements through the towns
on the way up? Cyclists are a little con-
spicuous in small country villages. Why
the devil didn’t the man begin with those
questions?
And ali this had McMasters foreseen. He
was not a Sherlock Holmes, but he knew the
narrow, suspicious mind of the criminal.
Silence would frighten Dido, and, ouc-e fright-
ened, he would be easily trapped.
From watchhouse to watchhouse, from
cell to cell, is the lot of the prisoner of the
\\hether the cell be in Melbourne, or
in Willalong, it looks just the same, and is
unconscionably dull and uninteresting. Dido
while the days dragged along toward his
appearance at the court, grew so tired of
the tour plain walls "f his room that he
was even pleased to meet McMasters, who
dropped in occasionally to see how he was
But his pleasure was mixed with
the doubt, born in the train, and strength-
ened in the seclusion of his cell. On the
day before the hearing of his case he could
sta i 1 £ tae sus P eose longer. He would try
and find out whether the rough scrawl in his
pocket-book had been deciphered as the plan
of the post office,
“Dreadful slow in the cell, Mr. McMas-
ters,” he said.
“Must be,” agreed the detective.
I am t convicted yet, neither, n he went
on.
The detective shook his head. He knew
what the next question would be. In a
quarter of an hour he would either have
ailed in the Willalong post office case, or
he would have Dido convicted out of his own
mouth.
“Can’t I have that little book of mine?”
came the question. “I’d like to have some-
thing to look at,”
“I’ll get you a novel,” replied McMasters.
“There isn’t much to read in your book.”
“Well, you see, the fact is there’s a couple
of notes there that’ll help me fix the dates
for my defence. You’ve always had the
name of bein’ a fair man, Mr. McMasters,
and you won’t stand in the way of my de-
fence,”
“Oh, can have the book. It’s in
the office, with the sergeant. Come in there
with me- —and, mind, don’t try to run.”
“Why should I?” replied Dido, following
McMasters with well-concealed eagerness.
“Sergeaut!” said the detective, “just give
me that note-book I handed you the other
day.”
Dido’s eyes glistened. He was about to
beat the best man in the C.I. Branch. What
a story for Bourke-street corner ! The detec-
tive took the book and sat down. The game
of silence was not yet over. He turned the
pages deliberately, without hurry or interest.
As if by chance he came upon the page
whex’e Dido’s plan was displayed. Dido
grew a little excited. The detective turned
over again languidly, and then came back
to the plan. He turned the drawing this
way and that, examining it with a sort of
puzzled disinterestedness. Dido’s eyes were
glued upon McMasters’s Hands, and the book,
as a bitch’s gaze fastens upon the hand
which holds her pup. The detective turned
over the pages again, and again came back
to the drawing. Still he spoke no word.
Dido could stand it no longer.
“What’s that troublin’ you?” he asked.
, “Nothing! Nothing!” replied the detec-
tive, turning the book upside down, and look-
ing intently at the drawing.
Dido came across and stood behind his
chair. “Oh that!” he said, laughing.
“I’m a bill-poster by trade, and that’s a plan
of one of my boardings.”
“Get out!” said McMasters, “You never
drew that.”
“Yes, I did,” replied Dido. “That’s a
hoarding dowq Footscray I pasted last
year.”
The detective closed the book suddenly.
“ ’Fraid I can’t let you have this book, Dido,”
he said, and Dido was taken back to his
cell in a very bad temper. When he had
been safely locked in, the sergeant’s curiosity
was satisfied. -
The detective laughed, and smacked his
leg.
“That plan, Jim, is the plan of Willalong
post office. Look at it. The doors, the
front room, the office, the counter, and the
safe, there in the corner. I had to get
from Dido’s own mouth that he had drawn
it, with someone for a witness. Dido
wouldn’t open his mouth. So I didn’t
father I reckoned I could scare him, and
I did. Speech, Jim, is silver, they say, and
silence is golden. And it’s silence that scares
your crook worse than bounce or bluff, or
question. It’s silence that’s going to con-
vict Mr. Dido Connelly and put him where
he belongs for five or more quiet years.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A DRONE of voices, and a drone
Of organ music rising to
A glad triumphant pealing tone—
And I am married, dear, to you !
_ So strange it seems to be so true,
I vaguely fear it may not last..
But here’s the train. We’re moving. .
Phew !
Thank Heaven, that ordeal’s past!
Ah. now I hold you close, and know
The strange sweet tiling is really true.
With gratitude I burn and glow ;
I own all ecstasy—that’s you.
These trains are rotten slow, but who
Knows? —we may get somewhere next week.
Ive got the snookiest room, dear. . .
Pooh !
We’re married now. Why can't I speak?
It’s just the maid, kid, with the tea.
What’s that? Don’t like? Good Lord!
who cares?
You blush, you know, bewitchingly.
I’ll get the tray. Our shoes (two pairs)
Are winking slyly at the stairs,
f hat maid smiled roguishly, the goose;
She ~etter far think of her prayers
Ilian let her thoughts go on the loose.
I never saw you look so well—
It suits you, all that lacy stuff.
Great Scot! there goes the breakfast-bell,
les, we’ll miss breakfast, sure enough
Your hair’s delicious, when it’s rough-
And-tumble round your shoulders so.
Life may be one colossal bluff;
But you're the genuine thing, you know.
Your mouth —novv, hang if if I could
■ But say the things these fellows write!—
Your mouth would melt a man of wood,
Your eyes are heavy with delight.
You’re glad. You said so, dear, last night,
With little sobs and sighs of love,
Things unmistakable though slight
That Love best knows the meaning of.
And I’m content. Content!—l’d like
To shout my joy from sea to sea,
And give the other chaps the spike;
But that would he unkind of me.
T ve known a thousand girls, maybe
But you’re the best of all the bunch,
You’re absolute felicity...
D’ you think we should get up for lunch?

makes the following claims upon your attention :
1 — It uses cheap lamp oil (such as kerosene), and other residuals.
2 The oil is injected directly into the cylinder, thus dispensing with unre-
liable and inefficient vaporisers.
3 It is very simple in construction, there being no electric ignition or other
complicated mechanism.
4 Its speeds are such that electric generators and centrifugal pumps may
be coupled direct.
5 No skilled labor is required, the supply of fuel and lubricant being all
the attention necessary.
