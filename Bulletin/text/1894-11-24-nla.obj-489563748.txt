Whether considered as a means to education or reorea-
tion, good eyesight gives us more satisfaction than all our
other senses put together; our eyes should therefore be
treated well. Thousands of persons who could not pre-
viously obtain Spectacles to correct their defects of vision,
have testified to the relief and comfort experienced when
fitted by WOOD'S standard tests.

The Cape Kaffir won’t work to the satis-
faction of the foreign exploiters. Being pos-
sessed of large reservations he can live easily by
working a few hours per day, and consequently
declines to slave for the European. Ceoil Rhodes
is, accordingly, introducing the “ Glen Grey Land
and Labour Bill,” by which Kaffir reservations
held in common will be broken up into patches of
six morgen per family—said patches to be strictly
entailed. Now, no decent-sized family can pos-
sibly live on six morgen ; consequently, certain of
its members must be thrown on the labour market
and made to compete for a living. By such gentle
gradations is the heathen lifted higher and higher
in the scale of civilisation.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
19 of this issue.
Dear Bulletin, —You, who are indisposed
to acknowledge humour in modern Hinglish
writers or actors, should pity them for having
inherited the fiction that they are “ funny ” from
ignorant ancestors. Congreve wrote, “ I look
upon humour to be almost of English growth ; at
least, it does not seem to have found such increase
on any other soil. And what appears to me to be
the reason of it is the great Freedom, Privilege,
and Liberty which the Common People of England
enjoy. Any man that has a humour is under no
restraint for fear of giving it vent; they have a
proverb among them which, may be, will show the
bent and genuis of the People, as well as a longer
discourse. He that will have a May Pole, shall
have a May Pole. This is a maxim with them and
their Practice is agreeable to it. I believe some-
thing considerable, too, may be ascribed to their
feeding so much on flesh, and the grossness of
their Diet in general.” If there is, or was, any-
thing in Congreve’s theory, Young Australia
must be laying the foundation of a glorious
national humour. —Yours, Meat.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
AT
The only really successful prevents
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for tbe Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-

Dear Bulletin, — However right “Binghi”
may be about the non-combativeness of Australians
generally, the Port Phillip wood-carters furnish —
or used to—a notable exception. It was once my
fortune to reside at a pub. near Dandenong, at
which these gentlemen used to settle their differ-
ences, and there was hardly a Saturday afternoon
that didn’t see three or four secundum artem
“ finish ’’-fights. Effusion of beer came first, then
of blood, then swankey again, and more gore, till,
when tanglefoot got finally on top, the paladins
would depart together in a high state of brotherly
love and bash. —A.M.
The English Radical press say Gladstone
should be gagged if he can’t keep his tongue quiet.
The gay ex-Premier persists in showing that
there’s life in the old dog yet, and has been utter-
ing opinions on the education question, and
the liquor question, and various other ques-
tions, quite at variance with the professions
and policy of the great Liberal party. Glad-
stone, in fact, declines to stay on his shelf.
He was born talking; he has lived talking ; and
he will die talking. The chances are that far
away in the 1900’s he will still be flooding the
country with dogmatic post-cards, impressions of
new books, defences of Genesis, and remarks that
the L.P. isn’t half what it used to be. And the
older and greyer and more drivelling he gets the
more the public will revere him, and the more
impotently the young lions of politics will wail and
curse as he spins interminable verbiage into
illimitable platitudes. The Liberal party has
lived for a long time on Gladstone’s tongue; it
wouldn’t be at all surprising if it died of it.

Dear Bulletin, —How’s this (fact) for a
tight place ? On many cattle-stations in G. and
N.Q. it is customary to destroy scrub cattle either
by shooting or by ripping them up. In the latter
case the operator rides up alongside the beast,
both often going at full gallop. Then the rider
stoops down, and with his knife makes a sudden
deep cut near the beast’s flank, disembowelling
him. The knife is brought from under the belly
up, and one cut suffices, the animal dying a
lingering death. For this brutal business both
nerve and quickness are required. One day a
young fellow, barely 21, named C , was out
with others on a station in Clermont (Q.) district.
He “took after” a scrub bull, intending to rip
him. He had his knife ready and was just stoop-
ing to make the cut when the bull swerved in
front of the horse—a common trick with beasts
when pressed. The collision resulted in horse,
rider and bull falling together, with the loins of
the bull pinning the man by his leg. Young
C had kept hold of his opened knife, and at
once ripped up the bull. The bull rose imme-
diately, and 0 got up, caught his horse,
remounted, and went on with his work as if
nothing had happened.—M. Rule.
“ Our existing system is not, as people
hypocritically pretend, a system of pure mono-
gamous marriage ; it is a mixed system of marriage
and prostitution, or rather, if one treats it from
the practical side in the order in which most men
come to know it, a mixed system of prostitution
and marriage. The greater number of men are
introduced to the sexual life through prostitution
alone ; they bring at last to marriage and the pro-
duction of future generations only the leavings
and relics of an effete constitution. Our whole
existing social fabric is based upon the degra-
dation of the paid harlot—that is to say,
upon the vile slavery of a large number
of unhappy women ; and it also involves other and
still more soul-killing practices on the part of a
vast proportion of our developing boys. Hardly
one man in ten brings to marriage and child-
getting an unimpaired virility. It will be the
object of the New Hedonism to combat these vile
vices ; to put the relation of the sexes and the pro-
duction of children on a sound and wholesome
basis, moral, physical, and emotional; to insist on
the rights of unborn and as yet unbegotten genera-
tions. Hedonists will not rest till they have re-
lieved the women of the community from the
hateful slavery of the streets, till they have vindi-
cated the claim of the children of the community to
a sound father and a sound mother. They will
not rest till prostitution is as effectually dead for
our race as polygamy ; till the equal freedom and
dignity of woman is universally admitted. What
they ask is that every man and every woman shall
live a life of perfect purity and perfect liberty ;
that every child shall be the pure offspring of a
healthy and natural union of unmixed affection.
No bought love; no forced cohabitation with a
drunken, a violent, or a distasteful husband, for
the production of hereditarily-tainted children;no
priestly blessing on a wicked bargain between
the unfit, the decrepit, the insane, the cancerous.
The New Hedonism will protest against all that,
and will cry out with a trumpet voice, in spite of
detraction, that whatever makes for race-preserva-
tion is pure and holy, whatever makes for race-
extinction or race-degradation is vile and hateful;
and it will hold it vile and hateful still, though
the Archbishop of Canterbury stand over to
invoke the benediction of God on a loveless mar-
riage or an immoral compact.”—Grant Allen, in
The Humanitarian.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1894.
Two Land-Tax Bills.
New South Wales and Victoria have simul-
taneously decided, subject to the approval of
an unfriendly Legislative Council, upon the
adoption of a Land and Income-tax. The
decision has been arrived at in different
ways, but in each case it is expressive of the
growing tendency towards direct taxation,
and the desire to make wealth bear a larger
share than heretofore of the public burdens.
In Victoria the Land-tax policy is not en-
tirely new. A small and inefficient impost
of a somewhat similar nature has long been
one of the minor sources of the public
revenue, and an additional Land-tax has
been levied by local Government bodies for
purely local purposes, but Premier Turner
proposes to largely increase the duty as a
means of meeting the deficiency which has
afflicted the province ever since the days of the
boom and the Coalition. In N. S. Wales it is
an entirely new device, land in that province
having been hitherto regarded as something
too sacred for taxation. Victoria proposes
to establish the new system as a matter of
necessity, and mainly for the purposes of
revenue. New South Wales does it in order
that it may dispense with a few of the exist-
ing Customs-duties, mainly those upon im-
portedluxuries—which dutieshave been found
guilty of encouraging local industries, and
furnishing the miserable Cornstalk inhabitant
with employment at the expense of the
foreigner. In New South Wales the Foreign-
trade party professes itself the Land-tax
party par excellence , and claims that Foreign-
trade and Land-tax are convertible terms.
In Victoria the lie is given to this blatant
issumptiou by the fact that it was the Pro-
tectionist party which first established the
tax, and it is the same party which now pro-
poses to increase it against the bitter oppo-
nition of the Argus —the great organ of
Freetrade in the South. Also, Premier
Turner introduces the Land-tax as an ex-
pedient, which it is; while Premier Reid
foolishly tries to elevate it to the dignity of
a gospel, which it certainly is not.
• • «
It is partly out of this difference of
sentiment that the chief discrepancy between
the two schemes arises. In each case
it is proposed to levy a tax of Id. in
the £ on unimproved values, but whereas
the Victorian measure allows an exemption
up to £lOO value, the New South Wales
proposal makes no such allowance. Assum-
ing the average value of agricultural land, in
its natural state, to be £2 per acre, the Vic-
torian farmer with 50 acres will go entirely
free ; the man with 100 acres will pay on 50
only ; the man with 150 acres on 100 only,
and so on. The obvious result is that there
will be a direct inducement to sell land in
small allotments and to keep it in a
state of subdivision. A farm of 50 acres,
with no land-tax upon it, should be worth, in
the open market, nearly 10 per cent, more
per acre than one of 20 times the size, of
which 900 acres are taxable. As a result the
tendency will be to create a multitude of
small farmers, by which system the produce
of the soil is vastly increased, it is made to
support a much larger population, and the
profits arising from the unearned increment,
instead of enriching a mere handful of huge
monopolists, are diffused throughout the
community. Also, it will create small inde-
pendent landholders rather than tenants
paying rent to landlords and corporations ;
and the fact that the mortgagee is taxed on
the same basis as the nominal landlord will
do something, at all events, to discourage
the curse of foreign capital which hangs so
heavily upon Australia.
* * #
Unluckily, Premier Turner, owing to want
of earnestness or some other cause, fails to
carry his own policy to its logical conclusion.
The £lOO exemption at one end of the scale,
and an additional impost of one-fifth of a
penny on the wealthy absentee at the other,
are an acknowledgment that there are land-
holders who are a benefit, and landholders
who are a curse, to the community at large,
but no sufficient distinction is drawn between
the two classes. The exemption, in the case
of the small landowner, is too small, and the
additional tax on the large one is not nearly
large enough. If the small landholder were
exempt up to £2OO of unimproved value,
and the tax were graduated up to 2d. or 3d.
in the £ on especially large estates, and the
impost on the absentee holder were increased
by 50 instead of 20 per cent., the amount
realised would be probably larger than
under the system now proposed, and the
benefit to the country would be incal-
culably greater. But politics are mainly a
matter of expediency, and Mr. Turner —in
a much greater degree than Mr. Reid —is
not his own master. Each Premier has to
reckon with a bitterly hostile Upper House,
but, whereas the New South Wales Council
can be swamped, if needful, by the appoint-
ment of new nominees, that of Victoria rests
on a property suffrage, and can be coerced
by no legal or constitutional means what-
ever. Therefore, Patterson’s successor has
probably carried his scheme of reform as far
as he can wioh any hope of success. The
present Land and Income Tax Bill may get
through the Chamber of Property ; a more
radical one would probably be hopeless from
the outset.
Premier Reid, with much greater oppor-
tunities, attempts oven less than his Victorian
contemporary. His bill contains the same
provision for a microscopic increase in the
case of the absentee, but it omits even Mr.
Turner’s scanty measure of exemption. Mr.
Reid has frequently acknowledged that the
small farmer should be encouraged in every
possible way, and that the large landholder
is a serious danger to the community, but in
the true Freetrade spirit he proposes to dis-
courage them both alike. The agriculturist
who makes a living out of £lOO or £2OO
worth of land is, in most cases, a miserably
poor and toilworn individual—about the
poorest and most toilworn in the community
—and the proposal to levy what is openly
described as a “wealth-tax” upon such
a person is unspeakably incongruous, but
even this aspect of the case cannot
prevail against solid Foreign-trade principles.
No provision is made for laying any special
disabilities even upon the largest land-
holders. Consequently, no inducements are
offered to them to sell their big estates, in
allotments, thus creating a class of small
land-holding agriculturists in place of tenants,
and dividing the unearned increment of the
future among a multitude of small properties
instead of using it to build up one colossal
fortune. The imperfections of Premier
Turner’s measure may be excused on the
ground that the Land Tax Bill must be
passed to save the Treasury from bank-
ruptcy, and it is necessary to present it in a
shape which will give it a fair show to get
through' the obstructive Upper House. But
Premier Reid is in no need of revenue, and
no special disaster will happen even if his
reform is temporarily delayed, therefore, the
dismally imperfect character of his proposals
is unaccountable.
* • »
Apparently Mr. Reid travels on the as-
sumption that the proposed impost is not an
expedient, but a cardinal virtue. As far as
can be gathered, he proposes to tax land, not
because it is accumulated wealth, for it is to
be taxed even in those cases where it is only
accumulated poverty ; nor with the purpose
of creating a race of small proprietary
farmers and diminishing the evils of land-
lordism, for the man who lets his land and
lives on the rent is placed on exactly the
same footing as the one who cultivates his
own holding ; nor witli a view to breaking
up big estates ; nor to raise revenue, for
revenue is not needed ; nor for any other
definite purpose whatever. He merely
does it because, according to a hazy
Single-tax theory, there is a certain virtue
in taxing land for its own sake, even
if no one is made any better or any
happier or any richer by the process.
Mr. Reid’s land-tax scheme, if it becomes
law, even with all its imperfections, will be
one of the few good things which has hap-
pened to New South Wales during the pre-
sent generation. But, all the same, it is a
miserably inadequate device, and its best
feature is that it will probably pave the way
for something better at a future date.
The Pack in Full Cry.
The passage of Australian Judges per ardua ad
alia —through the slough of Democratic society
to the holy ground of Privy Councildom—there
to
Sit and sip their nectar, while their bolts are hurled
Par below them in the valleys—
has always been a favorite dream of the Aus-
tralian “profession.” It has ever been felt that
the high capacity for cringing and tuft-hunting
wdiieh so many Australian lawyers display has
no fair field for its exercise under the Southern
Cross, where the rude blast of popular contempt
is apt to wither in its rathe and tender bloom
the fine flower of legal snobbery. This dormant
sense of wasted talent has been recently trans-
formed into a poignant and audible grief, and
the perplexed public which has not noticed the
pulling of the strings finds itself suddenly con-
fronted with the spectacle of an afflicted Bar
noisily piping its eye in the newspapers, while
a sympathetic Bench doubtless stands behind
to offer “moral support ” and handkerchiefs.
* * *
Fully to benefit by the many excellent morals
which this situation teaches, one should com-
prehend the force of the celebrated legal
maxim declaring that a door must be either
open or shut (Martin, 0.J., Brass v. Brass,
361 N.S.W. L.R.). To place an Australian Judge
on the Privy Council is to open another door to
preferment for Australian lawyers. This con-
clusion has been pithily summed up in the well-
known apothegm, “ Billet—fill it 1” (Stephen,
0.J., Catchem v. Chetum, 594 N.S.W. L.R.).
If a New South Wales Judge goes to England,
the whole of the New’ South Wales legal pro-
fession gets a leg up. A senior Q.C. becomes
Judge ; a junior Q.C. becomes a senior Q.C. ; a
stuff' gown is turned into silk ; and so on all the
way down to the briefless, hungry fledgling
wdio attends court only to act as claqueur
for ’Sonali’s w r eak jokes. The sequence
is logical as well as legal. Australian
Judge on Privy Council—door open —pro-
motion — Joy. No Australian Judge on
Privy Council —door shut—stagnation—Gloom.
This doctrine has been conclusively laid down
by the highest authorities (Cockburn, C.J.,
Spider v. Fly, 1033 L.R.).
« « •
Now, Judge Windeyer has nearly or quite
served the terra for which he was appointed to
N.S. Wales Supreme Court Bench, and the
problem which is exercising the N.S. Wales legal
profession is, What is to become of Judge
Windeyer ? He is still hale and vigorous ; he
is one of the best lawyers in Australia, as he is
one of the worst Judges ; he will hardly yet be
content to retire into private life. As he has
frequently had occasion to comment on the
ignorance of Australian matters shown by Privy
Council Judges, why should he not go to
England to spend his declining years in draw-
ing closer “those silken ties, which,” etc., and
perchance to transmit to posterity the record
of a grateful sovereign’s appreciation of the
services to throne and altar rendered by Baron
Windeyer, of Mount Rennie ?
• * *
There is no reason for believing the Judge
himself to be averse to the course indicated, as
he has little inducement to undertake a second
term of office in N.S.W. on the chance of becom-
ing Chief Justice. The present occupant of that
position, Mr. Frederick Darley, is a sturdy
Roman-father personage whose vigorous and
stately demarche is one of the sights of Sydney,
and who looks likely, bar accidents, to outlive
all his colleagues. Thus, if Judge Windeyer
were asked to-morrow, would he go to the
Eden above, it is all Maoriland to a moa that
he would reply with a ringing “ Right-oh !”
And the “profession,” as already explained, is
most anxious to shove him—just as the Queens-
land profession is anxious to shove Chief Justice
Griffith on to the Privy Council Bench as
Baron Griffith, of Kanakaland.

So, a few weeks ago, a timid little corres-
pondent wrote from Sydney to London Times,
and pointed out how desirable it was, in the
interest of Imperial unity, that some encourage-
ment should be given to loyal Australians
hungering to take their disputes to the other
end of the earth for decision. And the Times
said, “ Why, cert’n’ly!” and bellowed full-
mouthed support of the plain proposition that
Australian affairs should undoubtedly be
directed from London. And the imperialistic
papers, and what is left of the gang which ran
the insolvent Imperial Institute, took up the
cry, and rejoiced in this new proof that Aus-
tralia yearned to sacrifice herself for the benefit
of “the dear old mother country,” and the
Home News went so far as to congratulate its
readers that
There are discernible in the aspirations of the colonists
a note of Imperialism and a desire to share in the central
work of the great British family, w hich are very gratifying
at a time when—&&, &c.
The Home News went on to express the hope
that “ the matter will not be permitted to drop
into oblivion for the want of properly-organised
agitation.” And the wire-pullers in Australia
read and chuckled.
* * *
But, as Australians are quite indifferent to
the advantages of paying an extra judge a
high salary to go to England and decide
what shall be law in Australia, it is con-
sidered time something was done to work
up the agony here. The S.M. Herald ia
hand and glove with the lawyers ; and its sup-
port is secured. So the business of manufac-
turing local “public opinion” is rapidly
proceeding. Barrister 0. G. Heydon writes to
point out the enormous benefit which would
accrue to Australian suitors by taking their
cases regularly to London to be tried—what
glorious expenses there would be, how the
health of witnesses would be benefited by the
trip, how indefinitely legal costs would be piled
up, and how much more satisfactory would be
the decisions of an Australian Judge sitting in
London than the decisions of the same Judge
sitting in Australia. Barrister F. E. Rogers
(who threw up .£2OOO a year as Land Judge in
a huff because he could not get the exact
Supreme Court status and pension, and has, one
would imagine, been mighty sorry ever since)
writes to compliment barrister Heydon on his
“very able” letter, and thinks the Government
should take the matter in hand and open that
door at once. Barrister Robert D. Pring
writes to say that he has been struck in an
inexpressibly tender spot by the brilliant argu-
meuts of barrister Heydon and barrister
Rogers, that he cannot find words to
say how much he admires their noble notions,
and that magnet est veritas et prevalehit. And
presently the Herald will rise to point out the
singular unanimity of opinion which charac-
terises this correspondence, and to urge the
Legislature at once to proceed to the work of
securing the large profits which are waiting to
be plucked by the legal profession—no!—beg
pardon !—by “the country.”
# * •
Then some lawyer will move the adjournment
of the Legislative Assembly to draw attention
to the urgency of this great question, and
all .the other lawyers will listen gravely, and
will rise one after the other to affirm that they
have long thought that the highest interests of
Australia demanded that a judge should be
sent to the Privy Council, and it is a mystery
to them how Australia has managed to get along
so far without this indispensable stimulus to
national growth. And the lawyer-Premier will
be much impressed ; and, if it w'asn’t for the
Labor-party, The Bulletin really believes the
little job might be consummated.
* * *
So hyke on, good dogs ! Hark to their
music ! See that cunning old hound, laboring
doggedly just behind the leaders. He knows
too much to waste his breath in yelping ; he
leaves that to the younger ones. But The
Bulletin wagers he’ll be first in at the death.
Yoicks ! Tally-ho !
The Wairarapa Wreck.
Further evidence so far only serves to upset
all previous theories concerning the causes of
the Wairarapa tragedy. Captain MTntosh,
according to all available information, had been
noted throughout his career as a splendid navi-
gator, and a man of more than ordinary steadi-
ness, nerve and determination. Yet on this
occasion he seems to have set his vessel’s course
loosely, gone ahead at full speed on a rough and
foggy night through a dangerous archipelago,
and flatly refused, despite the suggestions of Ins
officers, either to slacken speed, to take sound-
ings, to blow the foghorn, or to use any precau-
tions whatsoever. Buch conduct on the part of
such a man can best be accounted for by ascrib-
ing it to one of those unsuspected mental kinks
on which are founded the great tragedies of the
world. It seems, to all intents and purposes,
a parallel case to that of Tkyon. Tha t unlucky
Admiral, alter a long and honorable career,
during which he was noted as a more than
usually efficient officer, deliberately smashed
his vessel in open daylight by peisisting
in an impossible manoeuvre, refused to
listen to the remonstrances of his subordinates
even at the last moment, declined to accept
assistance after the disaster, and finally went
down with his battered ship, a victim, appar-
ently, to a sudden derangement of the reason-
ing faculties. It does not seem, either in his
case or in that of MTntosh, to have been any-
thing resembling what is commonly known as
insanity. It looks rather like a sudden inertia—
a clouding of the mental eyesight—a general
slowing-down of the brain, which came upon
the patient after he had started on a dangerous
course, and caused him to let things slide.
Each man seemed overtaken with a torpor,
vaguely suggestive of opium or somnambulism
or partial catalepsy or aggravated fatalism,
which made him wait, in a calmly fatuous
fashion, for the catastrophe, doing nothing, and
caring very little, to avert it.
« * •
There are so many strange turns and twists
in the human mind, and so many undeveloped
possibilities lurking among the convolutions of
the brain, that no one can tell—possibly no
one will ever be able to tell —how such things
arise. Who knows for certain whether he is
mad or sane, or whether any other man is mad
or sane, or whether he or any other man is, or
is not, capable of developing insanity at any
moment ? Almost every man, at some period
or other in his life, has done something w eirdly
and unaccountably foolish, not knowing before-
hand that he was going to do it, and not know-
ing a moment afterwards why he had done it.
The result is set down by others to all manner
of stereotyped causes—drink, opium, chloral,
original sin, mental abstraction, nerve-exhaus-
tion, liver, indigestion, temporary insanity,
spiritual influences and possession by the devil.
It often happens that no one among all these
and many other explanations suits the case.
Just now “the after-affects of influenza” is
the stereotyped explanation of almost every-
thing which is otherwise unaccountable. Three
hundred years ago it w'as witchcraft. A cen-
tury hence it may be mesmerism, the influence
of elementary spirits—anything. Meanwhile,
the law seldom worries itself about scientific
or pseudo-scientific theories. A stereotyped
jury of cheesemongers and butchers and tailors
sits upon the case and inspects it from a strictly
meat and slop-clothing standpoint. The twelve
men in the box examine the accused’s state o
mind as if it were a dubious sample of cheese


and weigh it as if it were steak, and measure it
•with the yardstick, and return a verdict
accordingly. Their deepest research, heyoud
the scales and the yardstick, consists in asking
if anyone smelt the breath of the accused just
before the accident and noticed evidences of
drink. If there were no signs of drink about
his breath the question of his mental condition
is held to be settled, and the S.M. Herald has
a leader on the subject showing that this
species of recklessness must be* 1 put down.”
m * -e- •
'There is somewhere in the human brain a
flaw whereby it comes to pass that a simple
action which a man has to do hundreds of thou-
sands of times until it becomes so absolutely
mechanical that it seems beyond all possibility
of mistake, is always done wrongly at last.
There is another flaw whereby the thing that is
seen constantly may become so familiar that at
last it is seen even when it is not there. There
is likewise an unlimited possibility for not
seeing the thing that is there, or for being
unable to realise the nature of the situation
which has been met with so often as to become
almost a portion of oneself. The engine-driver
■who has started his locomotive thousands of
times to the dropping of the same signal, at
last, from pure force of habit, sees it drop in
his stereotyped imagination, and goes ahead,
and is wrecked. The man who has stepped
thousands of times into the same lift generally
■ends by stepping into an imaginary lift when
the real one is absent, and falls to the bottom.
When a drama has an unusually long run, an
;actor not unfrequently ends by forgetting his
part, to all appearance simply through incessant
iteration. People see ghosts, not only of
human beings but of inanimate things, and
receive spirit - messages, and hear voices,
and fall down and break their necks over
shadows or over objects that are not present.
Ocher people get up unexpectedly and cut their
throats, and it is duly explained at the inquest
that the deceased w T as well and happy right up*
to the moment of the “rash act,” and had no
imaginable cause for his sudden exit from this best
of all possible worlds. Others again suddenly
quit a happy home and abandon a prosperous
career, and go out to heal diseases with breath-
ings and red flannels. The world is full of
cranks, temporary or permanent—so full that
even every sane man has his turn at being a
crank some time or other in the course of his
life. If the disease comes on him at a moment
of grave responsibility, then he is court-mar-
tialled for cowardice, or his certificate is sus-
pended and a jury of cheesemongers and
butchers and tailors returns a verdict of man-
slaughter. If it comes on him at some other
time he probably writes poetry until he re-
covers, or invents a flying-machine.
Sometimes this curious kind of mental dis-
ability rests on a discoverable basis. A clot
of blood no larger than a pea may tem-
porarily obstruct the action of the brain,
and reduce the brightest intellect to torpid
stupidity. Sometimes no material cause what-
ever can be discovered. The imaginative
Celts of northern Britain recognised the exist-
ence of a state in which an otherwise sane man
goes recklessly and unaccountably to his
destruction with a light heart and an absolute
imperviousness to counsel, and described him
as “fey,” i.e., doomed. The (alleged) Anglo-
Saxon, who is not imaginative, does not recog-
nise such a state, and merely wants to know if
the deceased smelt of drink. Finding that he
didn’t, the Anglo-Saxon generally concludes
that he wasn’t smelt properly. The obvious
verdict on Captain MTntosh, of the Wairarapa,
will be that his ship was lost through utter-
recklessness and want of ordinary precaution.
But, whether he neglected all ordinary precau-
tion because his intellect temporarily stopped
working, as so many intellects do, sometimes with
visible cause and often without it; or whether
he had seen the open waters of the Hauraki
Gulf so often that at last he saw open water
where there was none; or whether he had
learned the art of navigation so well that he
suddenly forgot all about it it; or whether his
time and that of his ship had both come, and
they simply went ahead and fulfilled their
destiny according to that good old theory of
predestination which is brother to fatalism, no
tribunal can ever authoritatively decide. There
are things on which even twelve sober trades-
men who have been got together in a room and
sworn on an unclean Bible can throw no light
whatever. And one of them is the fact that
the best intellect has sudden stoppages and
breakdowns, and walks at times in its sleep,
and bolts at other times like that thoroughly
reliable horse which always does bolt sooner or
later. No penalty ever invented can remedy
this trouble. If the most methodical genius
on earth were entrusted with the simple
duty of calling round every day to move an
ash-barrel, and the whole universe were to stop
Tor ever if that barrel wasn’t moved, it would
still come to pass in the end that he would for-
get his duty and let the universe stop.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Indemnity for Trustees.
A Bill to extricate boomsters from a tight
place is passing quietly through the Victorian
Legislative Council. It is officially known as
the Trusts Act Amendment Bill. For some
time past scandalous disappearances of pro-
perty confided to trustees have been so fre-
quent and notorious that some amendment in
the acts of those protected persons was much
hankered aftef. Wherefore the late Solicitor-
General introduced the Bill aforesaid . during
last session. Its name was calculated to inspire
confidence, but when the Amendment Bill iiad
Jeeu further “amended” in Committee and
was about to become law the Patterson
Government got orders to cease legislating.
Mr. Cuthbert, the new Solicitor-General,
picked up the measure and brought it ag > u
before the Council last week, with a few cast"a!
remarks. Cuthbert, on the subject of clause
25, was interesting: “Only one or two slight
alterations had been made in the Bill as it
passed through Committee before. Clause 25
gave trustees an indemnity for lending on
mortgage upon the report of a valuer if
the loan was up to only three-fifths of the
value. An addition to that clause made it
retrospective . ” The addition is a little tiling
slipped in by Cdthbert. The former Solicitor-
General and parent of the bill (Wynne) pointed
out at once that the “ retrospective ” suggestion
was fully discussed last session, and rejected.
When the bill had undergone a second reading
for the second time, and been put into com-
mittee once more, Mr. Wynne attempted to
re-establish the original verdict on Clause 25
by moving that Mr. Cuthbert’s little addition
be expunged, but Sargood arose in his
ministerial might and brushed the protest aside
with a remark that “ if it is right now for
trustees to lend up to three-fifths of the valua-
tion on property it was surely right in the
past.” The same Council which wouldn’t
sanction a retrospective indemnity last session
was glad to swallow its scruples the other
night, and Cuthbert’s little extra was agreed
to. Clause 25, as it now stands, is full of com-
fort for anyone who devoted the widow and the
orphans’ cash to boom - promotion. Five
years ago, or even more recently, a man
was able to get a value of ,£5OOO put
upon a piece of ground that had cost him £5OO
the previous day. Then he went to his pal, the
trustee, and having winked thrice at that
responsible investor, procured a mortgage of
£3OOO upon the inflated property. In due
course the property reverted to its original
value, or less. The £3OOO robber generally
failed to pay up his interest, and the trustee
paid it himself rather than sell the land and
become liable for the difference between real
value and the boom “ loan.” Clause 25 relieves
him of his liability. The widow and the
orphans will have their claim upon their
financial protector wiped out by Act of Parlia-
ment. A few more years shall roll, and the
indemnified swindle of the old boom-time will
be the privileged popular swindle of another
boom time, thanks to clause 25. To the poor
victims, who find their money lost in a 3-sths
advance upon a valuation ten times greater
than it should have been, another Sargood will
explain that what was right in the past must
surely be right evermore.
The Registration Clause—Again!
According to the foolish registration clause in
the Reid Government’s new N.S.W. Land Bill,
a certain circuitous measure of protection from
seizure by creditors is afforded to the N.S.W.
selector, who registers bis homestead according
to certain elaborate forms and ceremonies which
no average selector is ever likely to understand.
The Bulletin has twice pointed out that the
protection ought to be afforded without regis-
tration, that the process ought to be automatic
and universal, and that if it is a good thing to
protect the agriculturist’s home from seizure for
debt it is a good thing to do it whether he is
registered or not. The following extract, from
the recently-published report of the S.A. In-
spector of Homesteads, shows how this paper’s
view of the matter has been upheld by experi-
ence elsewhere :
By clause 12 of the Blockholders’ Loans Act of 1891 pro-
vision was made for indorsing the leases of blockholders
to secure them from seizure for debts incurred after in-
dorsement, but from some cans • or causes this provision
has been availed of in Only a few instances, partly because
of a disinclination on the part of men suffering from mus-
cular weariness to do anything out of the usual routine,
and mainly from an inability to apprehend any immediate
benefit in attention to the matter or danger from neglect-
ing it. If the provisions clause were inserted in and made
part of the lease at the outset I believe it would be univer-
sally appreciated.
The moral is that it is not safe to leave too
much to individual initiative. Most men want
to be protected against themselves more than
against anybody else. Also, very few people
in any grade of life, and very few indeed among
the working classes, know anything in parti-
cular about law, and the most beneficent law
that was ever enacted generally remains for
many years a dead letter if its advantages are
purely optional. This applies to the registra-
tion idea in particular. Every man thinks
himself immortal until he dies, and no man
worries about his own prospective insolvency
until his debts become burdensome. A system
which enables him, when he is free from liabili-
ties, to secure his home against possible lia-
bilities in the future, doesn’t appeal to the
average citizen in the least. How many men
have the sense while prosperous to settle a
home on their families ?
Land-Tax and Land Resumption.
One of the principal advantages to be derived
from a land and property tax —as distinguished
from a lax on unimproved land-values only
is that it supplies an authentic valuation of all
the fixed property in the province, which valua-
tion is of the utmost importance when the
Government is resuming land for State pur-
poses. Hitherto there has been, in New South
Wales, no land-tax of any kind, and, conse-
quently, no authentic valuation whatsoever.
When a new railway or other public work is in
course of construction the owners whose pro-
perty is to be resumed almost always demand
twelve times, and generally get six or eight
times, its real worth. Almost every auctioneer,
valuator, estate agent, or other business man
in the province will rise up and perjure himself
on the subject for a reasonable fee, and as the
result New South Wales has already been
swindled out of (probably) £10,000,000 or so,
per medium of the Public Works Department,
and will be swindled out of many more
millions in the future if the present fraudu-
lent system is continued. And, so far as
appears up to date, it is to be continued.
The proposed tax will supply very little
information which will be of service ;
it will furnish an authentic record of unim-
proved values only, but the value of the im-
provements will still be estimated on the testi-
mony of the same old lying auctioneer, and the
country will be swindled in very much the same
old way as heretofore. And even if the Local
Government system provides for levying rates
upon lands and all improvements thereon, and,
consequently, for a valuation of all the lands
and improvements in the province, this also
will be of no service whatever, unless it is pro-
vided bv law that all resumption 0 -hall be made
on the basis of the Local Government valua-
tion, with a small percentage (10 per cent,
would be quite enough) added as compensation
for disturbance. Victoria has about the most
perfect Local Government system in Australia,
but, for want of this simple and logical proviso,
an owner is allowed to pay taxes on a value of
.£lOOO and yet to claim —in which case
he generally gets ,£SOO0 —for his property, when
it is required for railway or other public pur-
poses. And, according to all present appear-
ances, New South Wales is going to miss its
opportunity in precisely the same manner.
What is wanted is that there shall be one tax —
whether for local or central purposes doesn’t
matter—which shall be based on the value of
lauds and improvements, so as to provide the
necessary valuations, and that the State shall
have power to make any resumptions it may
think tit on the basis of these valuations, and
on them onty. A too close devotion to the
principle of taxation on unimproved values
alone will leave the land-resumption swindle
very much where it was before. At the best,
and provided special legislation is passed-to
that effect, it will prevent the perjured
valuator swearing quite so freely as here-
tofore about the value of the land itself,
but this will only cause him to perjure him-
self all the more concerning the improvements,
and the difference in the final result will be
comparatively small. Experience has shown
that there is no limit to the value which an un-
blushing expert will put upon a four-roomed
shanty, provided he is paid a reasonable fee for
doing it, and there is also no visible limit to the
amount which a jury will award when the State
has to pay. For some occult reason, when the
State has to pay, a jury’s sympathies are
always with the “resumed” proprietor, and if
it is precluded by law from awarding exorbi-
tant amounts as compensation for resumed land,
it will simply award the same compensation for
fences, buildings, crops, and damage to the
owner’s feelings through the rending of home
ties. Unless all such awards are fixed on an
automatic principle, the resumption swindle
has no end.
Any Australian Government which wants to do
some genuine retrenchment might begin by
abolishing the Postmaster-General. The Post-
office is a department which runs itself just as
effectually as does the Observatory, or the
Botanic Gardens, or the Government Printing
Department, and it no more requires a Cabinet
figure-head than any of them. It goes on in
the same business routine whether Protec-
tionists or Freetraders are in power; there
is no political principle involved in its
management any more than there is in the
Patents Office or the Barristers’ Admission Board,
No man’s political principles are of the slightest
use in the Post-office. The new Minister has
simply to start and learn the business or else
let it alone. If he lets it alone—most of them
do—there is no use for him. If he learns it he
is “ chucked out” just as he is beginning to
know something, and again there is no use for
him! If he lets it alone he wastes nobody’s
time and salary save his own ; if he insists on
learning things he wastes the valuable
time of the Deputy P.M.tr. In teaching
him. The Postmaster-Generalship is ixually
reserved for the acknowledged fool of
the Cabinet, because any fool can fill the billet
by simply staying away. If the billet and the
salary were dropped altogether, and the
Deputy-P.M.G. was left to run things—which
he does already—it would save a bleeding
country something like .£l5OO a year. Also, it
would save the necessity for having a fool in
the Cabinet. The position is so eminently
suited for a mild, unobtrusive dolt that its
existence makes it seem almost necessary to
find a dolt to fill it.
Dear Bulletin, —I am a Sydney man at pre-
sent visiting England. Naturally I went to the
Imperial Institute, and with a fellow-Austra-
lian eventually found myself in one of the
numerous refreshment-rooms. I carefully
scanned the wine-card, and, in the long list,
failed to find one single production of Australia.
On interrogating the waiter he said they had no
“ colonial” wines on sale. The fact speaks for
itself. Here is an Australian-subsidised insti-
tution whose professed object is to foster the
relationship between Great Britain and her
colonies and to boom the industries of the
latter, more especially when they do not
clash with those of the former country ; yet
while wines from all foreign parts can be
obtained there is no chance given to_ the
English public to taste the pure juice of the
grape produced by us. Neither are there any
Cape or other colonial wines on sale. This, in
spite of the fact that the Australian wines are
extensively advertised on all the railway-
stations and other places, and exhibits of them
can be seen in the Courts. In the N.S. Wales
section is a large painting, supposed to repre-
sent a view of Sydney harbor. A more
wretched picture I have rarely seen. It looks
as if the painter had done it from a small
photograph and trusted to his imagination to
fill in the details. The whole thing is a dis-
grace to the Court, and bears no resemblance to
the place it is supposed to represent. Surely
someone connected with the Institute lias seen
“ our beautiful harbor,” and must know that it
is not a picture of it ! —Yours truly, P. J.
Marks.
The success of the Maoriland Village Settle-
ment system, as compared with the failure of
the schemes adopted in N.S. Wales and Victoria,
clearly shows that the virtue of self-help is the
one which it is most important to cultivate
when attempting to “ settle the people on the
land.” The M.L. Village Settlement scheme,
or, as it is locally known, the “Small-farm
Association System,” is wholly individualistic
in principle, though voluntary co-operation is
practised and encouraged. The settler gets his
land on perpetual lease at a rental of 4 per cent,
on value, and the Govt, has power to make a
small advance to enable him to build a house.
Where possible, contracts for road-making and so
on are put in this way. It is found, however, that
the less money the Govt, advances, the better
it is for the settlers; and no advances whatever
were made to last year’s settlers. But the
essence of the system is that every man’s re-
ward is in exact proportion to his labor ; he
knows that what he earns is his own ; and the
vital spirit of independence which this plan
fosters must be adopted in Australia also, if
village-settlements are ever to get beyond the
status of a State-soup kitchen.
If it is desirable to prohibit the relatives of
Judges from pleading before those Judges to
whom they are kin, is it not advisable to pro-
hibit lawyers from appearing before coroners
and magistrates to whom they are blood-
related ? But the plumping of the pebble of
investigation into this pool of enquiry disturbs
never-ending circles. Many men—and judges,
magistrates and even bush-coroners are only
men—are more readily and powerfully swayed
by friends whose tendrils are mere sympathies
of sentiment, by business dominances which
exert a garotter’s choke, by money-lending
vampires of the Scrooge order, by fearsome
Mrs. Grundys that threaten to scrape off the
coatings from whited sepulchres, and by dozens
of irrational and distant influences, than by any
of the manly and natural predilections that
spring from the verity embosomed in the other-
wise inane proverb that “ blood is thicker than
water.” Yet it is because the natural, manly
and healthy affections are the more excusable,
and because the sinister influences are less
easily concealed when once suspected, that
public feeling resents the familied monopoly of
the law-courts and so-called courts of justice
by men whose social boast it is that they are
pedigreed in the science of living gorgeously on
human vices and of murdering truth and
debauching justice for commensurate fees; while
it is not greatly troubled by more sinister
influences, since these run risks specially their
own.
Japan thinks of taking, by way of indemnity,
the Chinese ironclad fleet, <£100,000,000, and
the island of Formosa, and stipulating that
Corea shall be declared independent. This, if
it comes off, ought to about finish the Chinese
bogy. China has lost Burmah, Annam, Ton-
quin, Siam, Hongkong, Corea, and great slabs
of Manchuria and Chinese Tartary, all within
half a century, so that, in point of area, about
one-third of the empire is already gone. And
now that the ghastly weakness of the whole
leprous house of cards is fully revealed by the
Japanese campaign, Russia, which has hitherto
held off from actual hostilities, will probably
annex a lot of sea-coast, and then the other
Powers will also take a bite apiece, and China
will crumble away all at once. Europe has
possessed herself successfully of America, Aus-
tralia, Africa, and most of Asia, and she must
finish the job sooner or later. For all China is
worth to humanity at large, it might as well be
sooner as later.
The quick-brained and mercurial B. R. Wise,
M.P., is unlikely ever to develope into a master-
ful political leader. Ringnosed long ago by
Parkes, he appears unable to escape from an
inexplicable hypnotism. Placed by accidental
luck in prominent confederation with Premier
Reid, he threw over his newer chief under ex-
cuses that fell short of reasons by their abject
childishness, and had not even the vicious
stamina of audacious “crams.” Then, alarmed
at the askanceness of the attitude of his own
supposed special party, and the feebleness of
the support accorded to his trembling rebel-
lion, he rushes back into the arms of his
brother for no cause greater than that there
was no “ strawberry-mark on his left arm.”
Next, becoming conscious that he has been pub-
licly playing the fool, he attempts to discount
the reconciliation by declaring that it was
merely an accidental incident leading to a better
understanding between Reid and himself.
And this unstable unit was once the unmatured
hope of the New South Wales democratic
party. The only pity is that a possible coali-
tion cannot be effectually strangled with a rope
of sand.
The latest shearing trouble has broken out in
Otago, M. L., where sundry pastoralists have fixed
up a new freedom-of-contract agreement, under
which “ the shearer is to forfeit half his wages
if he leaves or is dismissed before shearing is
finished.” As he can be dismissed at the option of
the pastoralist, for any reason, or for no reason at
all save that the employer “darned well pleases”
to have it so, this agreement enables the squat-
ter to swindle every out of half his
wages. The customary plea is advanced, of
course, that no squatter would so shamelessly
abuse his authority, but no one professes to
explain why he is striving so hard to get the
power to perpetrate a heartless swindle if he
doesn’t.mean to use it. When a man struggles
his hardest to fix things so that he can defraud
another man if he wants to, there is very little
satisfaction in his own unsupported assurance
that he wouldn’t defraud the other man on any
account.
Editor Bulletin, The progress ol demo-
cracy in Australia can hardly be said to be in
full way until legislation has authorised a
system of licences by means of which men in
want of land can enter and cultivate unused
land in the same way as under the “ miners’-
right ” system men can enter unused goldfields
land to seek for gold. Farmers’-rights are as
necessary for justice to the farmer as miners’-
rights —won at the cost of blood—were and are
to the miner. There is no principle of morality
or of law which justifies or opposes the one
which cannot be brought forward with respect to
the other. The landowner on paper has no more
right to “shepherd” an unused block, waiting
for a bu3'er, than the miner to “ shepherd” his.
Use is the only true test of title, and in mining
the principle is tentatively at work, and it may
be said successfully. The law of titles to land
is founded on feudal principles, evolved in
the atmosphere of an age so unlike ours as to be
an anonjaly now, and accordingly is unjust to
those living now. The law of mining titles is a
product of our own times, our own wants, has
been moulded in accordance with our own sur-
roundings, and accordingly has a foundation of
justice. If it’s wrong for the unemployed man
to cultivate a few acres of the squatter’s run
now„it was wrong for the poor miner to break
the soil and frighten the sheep of the Crown

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNRV SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Her Majesty's ... “The Two Orphans.”
Lyceum “Tne Foundling.”
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK,
Princess s Theatre “ Nitouche.”
Theatre Royal “Jack Sheppard.”
Bijou ... "Skipped.”
The “Two Orphans ” opened their sorrow-
ful career at Sydney Majesty’s on Saturday in a
manner to which no serious objection could be
taken. This drama of 18th-century Pans concerns
the fates of two sisters—one blind and lost, and
the other distracted with grief and found by the
police ; and of two brothers—one a feeble cripple,
who grinds scissors, and the other a hulking
loafer, who drinks, and otherwise walks in the
footsteps of his hanged father. The latter is, in
The Bulletin’s opinion, the finest character in
Mr. RijJnold’s extensive repertoire, and this paper
is prepared to sit down flat on its solemn affidavit
and attest that it doesn’t know anywhere an actor
who could fill the part Letter. Jacques’ cursings,
the things which lie throws at his lame brother,
his ferocious humor, the cheerful manner in which
he shakes the loose coppers out of his mother and
brother for drink, his beneficent schemes for
“stoushiag” the blind girl, his huge calves and
frowsy overcoat, his horrid guffaw, the vigor with
which he kicks the furniture immense distances,
and his ghonl-like agility, make him one of the
most complete, artistic and thoroughly interesting
hogs of this paper’s acquaintance. If Mr. Rignold
would only give up playing the hero for awhile
and take to a course of unmitigated villainy, there
would be a boom at Her Majesty’s. G. R. isn’t
nearly so good a hero as he imagines, and he is
several dozen times better as a villain than he is
aware of.
* * *
The blind girl’s part consists chiefly in being
dragged around, and Miss Athena Claudius com-
pares very feebly just here with the vanished
M aggie Knight. Also her sister. Miss Watts-
Phillips, calls up recollections of another
lost idol in the form of Lucia Harwood,
and suffers by the comparison. Scot Inglis,
as the knife-grinding brother, is only ob-
jectionable through his habit of spreading his
hand over his chest to express emotion ; when he
forgets this mannerism and proceeds, after a hard
fight, to disembowel G. Rignold with a dinner-
knife, which some customer gave him to sharpen—
and which that person will probably carve his
dinner with afterwards —he gives pleasure to all
save the disembowelled lessee. Mrs. Melville,
the mother of the fallen savage and the knife-
grinder, fills another beery part unobjectionably,
and the other 21 characters occupy the stage while
these people are out begging, or drinking, or being
arrested, or otherwise getting into trouble. A
chorus of ladies of loose character lends the drama
an up-to-date expression. The period is supposed
to be that of Louis XVI., at which time there
existed, among other grotesqueries, a chib, where
fashionable ladies whose characters wouldn’t bear
close inspection, used to meet at intervals and cane
each other as some amends for their sins. A good
deal of eccentricity may be excused in such an
epoch as that.

“ Hands across the Sea ” didn’t meet with
the fate that its loyal idiocy deserved, and was
allowed to go on hoisting the British Flag for two
weeks, whereas one would have been more than
enough. It comes to a well-deserved end on
Friday, and “ The Wearin’o’the Green,” a new
Irish drama, succeeds it. It is anticipated that
this production will throw some new lights upon
the praste and the dhirthy informer, and that
there will be a colleen in it. At all events, the
present scribe is going to attend with a view to
seeing these parties, and if there is no colleen his
best feelings will be outraged and he will probably
take an opportunity of saying so.

“ The Foundling,” in three acts, a comedy
never before seen in Australia, is to succeed the
“New Bov ” at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday.
This comedy is heralded by a number of enthusi-
astic English press-notices.

To-morrow’s (Friday) performance at
Sydney Royal is to be for the benefit of the Waira-
rapa sufferers. Gov. Duff has undertaken to lend
his honoured grey head and his weary countenance
in the good cause, and a fashionable audience is
expected.
The Halle well Glee Club gi ve a concert at
the School of Arts, Sydney, on Saturday, 24th
inst Th ■ second act of Gluck’s “Orf4e ” will be
given, with Miss Louie Galvin as Orffio. Dr.
Crotch’s famous motet, “ Methinks I hear the full
celestial choir,” will be rendered by Mr. Halle-
we'l and invisible chorus. Two 16th-century
madrigals will be sung for the first time in Sydney,
and solos, vocal and instrumental, will be rendered
by Misses L. and A. Galvin and Messrs. Halle-
well, Staell, Sykes, Uinchy, Morley, &c.

Though “ Predatoros” was first introduced
to the world at an Australian theatre, the world
is not likely to cultivate its acquaintance. Gov.
Robinson’s music is really no stronger, or less in.
sipid, than the libretto. For the most part, it
seems incapable of finding employment for a large
orchestra. On the two or three occasions when
the composition is bold and extensive, it sounds
reniembersome, and nut one humorous musi-
cal effect relieves the sentimental monotony
of Robinson from first to last. Nellie Stewart,
Florence Young, Elsie Cameron, Brownlow,
Tapley and Lauri gave “Predatoros” such a
chance as no other local production would be
likely to get. They knew their words and were
all in good voice alter a Sunday rest. Perhaps
they forgot the tail-end of an air sometimes, but,
if so, they guessed at it, and they couldn’t well
guess wrong. The end of a Robinsonian melody
casts its shadow before. You can feel it coming
on, like the fits you have been subject to from
childhood upwards. Also, the premonitory symp-
toms are drowsiness, and a desire to go out for
refreshments. Feminine sassiety slumbered freely
during the second act of “Predatoros,” but the
men had their little tonics at the intervals, and so
found strength for an outbreak of loyal applause
at the finish. There was a small patch of enthu-
siasm in the amphitheatre, too. Somebody had
evidently planted it aloft—such things never get
there of their own free-will.
Copies of the pictures selected for W. and
M.’s tableaux are freely displayed at Glen’s, on
Melbourne Block. So far from the naughtier
ones being smuggled out of the window when
Maw worm snorts (as suggested in last issue), the
very naughtiest of all are allowed to beguile
johnnies, with a hope that they (the j’s) will see
the figure-subjects faithfully reproduced in the
flesh. This is, unhappily, a delusion. Will-o’-the-
Wisp in the picture has nodings on, whereas in
the tableaux the young lady conceals a critical
portion of her sweet outline with an absurd wisp
of muslin, or something.. J. C. W., who is a
terror for propriety, was probably the author of
this inartistic anachronism. He’s really Will o’
the Wisp—d'yer notice it?
The girls themselves, feeling quite at ease and
decent in their tight coverings, don’t care for
these irrelevant cloths. The damsel cast for the
statue of Venus, when posed on the white pedestal,
at rehearsal, raised an objection to the yard or
two of sheeting which the manager required her
to hold bunched in front of her. She would have
preferred to be like the original statue, for where
was the harm—in tights? “I say,” enquired
Venus, “can’t I do without this nuisance of a
thing?” The lump of calico was a difficult
matter to keep motionless, perhaps, with breezes
blowing from the wings. Poor girl! she gets over
the trouble now by pressing it close against her
form, as though she were ci ying to warm herself.
“Nitouche” and the Living Pictures have
come to stay awhile at Melbourne Princess’s. The
convent angel who takes a wildly-impossible night
off is reckoned one of Miss Nellie Stewart’s hap-
piest efforts, and indeed she acts with so much
French vivacity that one might think she was
creating the part. The drummer’s song is a
mighty success, in spite of a little English trans-
lation. Miss Nellie makes it seem a sparkling
ditty, whereas the incident of a bass drummer
meeting the girl he was formerly engaged to is not
a little bit comic. The lame, misshapen yarn, with
its witless refrain, fetches an encore for the sake of
the incidental business, which the actress pre-
sumably brought from Paris, but, if she hadn’t
gripped the very spirit of the business, what a
silly Song of the Drum it would be ! Organist
Laud remains a loyal Briton throughout. He
even sneezes, and falls upon his head in Anglo-
Saxon, and, as he is not required to sing a song of
the “Poof !-Bltf ” pattern, his insular performance
gives general satisfaction.
The Tableaux have been accepted without
a struggle. They attract young and old of either
sox an 1 every shade of political opinion, but their
influence is chiefly felt by the bald-headed Free-
trader. It sometimes happens that thelightiug of
the statues is not quite satisfactory, and the faces
suffer accordingly. No fault can be found, how-
ever, with the right-hand figure in the “ Three
Graces’’ group. This young lady is diviuelv
lovoly throughout. Her costume consists of
nothing, just nothing at all, and she would seem
an almost too-striking novelty if the tail-end of
the middle Grace’s drapery didn’t casually screen
a few square inches of her fair sister from the
limelight. It is an artful arrangement, tempting
many people to book seats for the next evening in
the hope that the centre Grace will not allow her
bit of garment to do double duty again. Alas !
it is always hanging carelessly in exactly the same
way.

“ Morocco Bound ” has suddenly turned
up again, in Melbourne, at the Bijou. A crowded
house on Saturday, and an abundance of horse
laughter, promised a lively season for Elton,
Shine, and Co., in their new quarters. The show
is not reduced in size, although the charges of
admission average about 60 per cent, less than
the Princess’s tariff, on which terms “ Morocco
Bound ” is undoubtedly a very cheap line in
public entertainment. Numerous gags, suitable
to a popular-priced audience, were worked in by
Elton on the first night. The squire’s little jokes
fell like hail upon the docile person of his big
baritone son, who stood aside and smiled patiently
until the leading man had finished with him.
Perhaps the younger son, the fair, fragile young
man who has pined in the background thus far,
could also be turned to account by his stage
parent. The ballet improved on its previous
Melbourne performances by rolling head over
heels, but the best of lady can-can dancers (and
these are not of the very best, by any means) cut
tame figures compared with men in skirts.

In “Little Jack Sheppard,” at the Royal»
the he-girls turn somersaults with as much vigor
as neatness. The idea of male athletes in female
evening dress turning a couple of somersaults in
lieu of “ ladies chain ” sounds vulgar. As a
matter of fact it is exceedingly droll, besides being
an object-lesson in decency to the ordinary woman
of daily life who can’t fall off a tram without
finding cause to feel ashamed. The “ Jack Shep-
pard ” quadrille is doomed to disappear with the
rest of the burlesque after Friday. Maggie
Moore’s gold-laced coat and satin smalls are going
back into the wardrobe, and on Saturday she will
lead the company buck to drama.

parts of the programme with the very same shiny brow'

had a heroine to kiss in three out of the four dramatic
scenes put on, Juliet alone escaping. Miss Juno recited
a i alleged Australian poem about a back-blocks bore who

had to make a quick change from the heroine dressed in

the boy ’s dress beneath her other costume. The moment
arrived for the change, which was made, and on to the
stage she bounced. Presently a roar of laughter came
from the audience, which, to her astonishment increased
in volume. Then she made the awful discovery that She
had neglected to remove her hustle and had returned to
the stage we iring it over the boy’s costume. The act was
never repeated.

pretty well alone. Beyond a certain gilded class, who

Every performance lasts a fortnight, and at the Towers
the local “lallikins” grew so tired that they stoned the
singers and brought one scene to a sad conclusion not
provided in the libretto. The Emperor of China and his
Court, a mandarin and his wives, a good fairy, a rebel,
and a lady of uncertain virtue, are among the characters,
and European appreciation of their efforts is heightened
by utter inability to distinguish which from t’other. The

A well-known Australian boniface who, years agone,
was a prominent actor and whose bigness of heart is well-
known, finds himself occasionally in awkward predica-
ments through his verbal mannerisms. “With pleasure,
deah boy, with pleashah,” was a favorite expression of
his. One day he called at the house of a fellow-actor to
inquire after the health of the latter’s wife who had been
ill. “ She is dead—died an hour ago, Cully,” answered
the widower. “ Come up stairs and look at her, old
fellow.” “Certainly, with pleasure, deah boy, with
pleashah,” was the reply.

During the boom-time there were few more
powerful names than that of a certain man whose name
it will be charitable not to mention. On the burst coming,
he had not the advantage of the later discovery by which
boomers could privately compromise at Jd. to 6d. in £,.
and he had to file. Nearly all his contemporary speculat-

fractional compos, and are big bugs again, but his action
in “ filing ” is regarded by them as so contemptible that
ne’er a one of them would come forward last week and'
find a matter of £l4 to prevent his being committed for
trial for alleged embezzlement. If he were to inform a

An examination of Federal Bank officials is
being held in Melb. Insolvency Court, for no avowed pur-
pose. Perhaps it had to be held to satisfy the Law, in
which case the Law would seem to have waited as long as
possible with the hope that the directors intended to die
before their evidence was called for. The exam, has an
extraordinary interest for all who are not too sick to re-
member the tone of the presiding Judge Molesworth
when James Muuro, as an insolvent, applied to him for a
sixpenny certificate of release from his debts. The ex-
chairman of the Federal, as we remember, carried off his
certificate with flying colours. Judge Molesworth re-
marked that poor Jimmy’s failure was the result of pure
bad luck, and his Honor went out of his learned way to
grant the insolvent’s release with much pleasure.
Hear Judge Molesworth with reference to the
bank dealings of Munro’s co-director, William M‘Lean
“ False balance-sheets are most discreditable to people
who manufacture them. You could use a very ugly word
[by the way, judges don’t use ugly words except in
denouncing ill-dressed culprits] to describe this transac-
tion, for it is an ugly one. Some people who did such
things might be prosecuted as conspirators.” How tiring
is this talk of what might be done, but is never accom-
plished-in Melbourne 1 But why stir up another of the
old Melbourne stinks in order that a jury may call it otto
of roses ?
On the 31st March, 1892, William M’Lean’a
account at the Federal Bank was £25,314 in debit. So he


stepped across the road to the Commercial Bank, and
arranged with to draw a £25,000 cheque on that in-
stitution and pay it into the Federal for "balancing
purposes.” Next day he drew a little £25,000 cheque
on the Federal and pair) it into the Commercial, where-
upon Gyles Turner must have rejoiced to find how punc-
tual friend M’Lean was in putting his account straight.
A guileless Court will, it seems likely, send for Gyles
Turner to “explain” this transaction, as though it
couldn’t speak for itself.

The Mutual Assurance Society of Victoria (like
the Mutual Life of Australasia) proposes, in its future
balance-sheets, to follow The Bulletin’s recent suggestion
by showing outstanding rents and interest, and rents and
interest accrued but not yet due, as two separate items.
The wisdom of this course is easily apparent. Provided
that an office does not follow the nefarious custom of
disguising overdue interest by adding it to the capital
sum of the mortgages as shown in the balance-sheet—
and the Colonial Mutual, Mutual of Australasia and
Mutual Of Victoria all distinctly announce that they have
never done this—the prudence of its investments may be
roughly gauged by these signs: (1) The amount of in-
terest realised—if this is abnormally high it suggests
recklessness, and if it is abnormally low it sometimes
means that large sums of interest have had to he written
off as irrecoverable, in which case it often happens that
the capital is also irrecoverable; (2) the amount of property
acquired by foreclosure ; and (3) the amount of rents and
interest “outstanding”—which term generally meansthat
a good part of the amount is in the first stage of putrefac-
tion. In the absence of a complete system of State audit
these are the only evidences on which the public can form
any kind of estimate, therefore every society should show
separately the amount of property acquired by foreclosure
as distinguished from that which was bought for
office purposes, and the interest and rent outstanding in
contradistinction to that which is merely accrued but not
yet due. The Mutual of Victoria already does this so far
as concerns the property-account with good results, and,
it is understood that the overdue interest item—which
is very small in any case—will also be sub-divided for the
future.

William Farmer, baronet or something like
that, and head of the great Sydney firm of Farmer & Co.,
returned to New South Wales, the other day, after an
absence of 20 years. The employes- 531 of them—held a
great pionio in his honor, and announced in the usual
fashion that he was a jolly good fellow, which, so far as
he was personally concerned, seemed quite a reasonable
statement. Tub Bulletin had somehow altogether for-
gotten that Fanner’s was another of those big Australian
firms whose profits mostly go to Hingl ind and help to
swell the annual £20,000,000, or so, drained out of this
beggared country, and it is sorry to he reminded of the
tact. Apparently there is only about one big firm out of
ten or more whose profits don’t go to some chronic
absentee or other in far-off Hingland. The only Joy
about the system is that, while every absentee is helping
to ruin the country which maintains him, he is also help-
ing to bring along the time when he will be ruined him-
self. But the time comes very slow'ly.

The Victorian Full Court has decided that poor,
down-trodden Matthew Davies is to get an unconditional
certificate of discharge, despite the decision of the Judge
in Insolvency to the contrary. Also, the Chief-Justice
went out of his way to sympathise with Matthew D., and
to point out the spotless purity of the man. “There
came a financial narrowing,” said the soulful Madden,
“the result being that the various companies in which
the insolvent’s funds were invested broke down, the mort-
gages became worthless, and he was stranded. The insol-
vent should not be held responsible for this state of
things.” The Pull Court was apparently quite oblivious
of the fact that the crushed Matthew didn’t exactly
invest his funds in the companies in question ; as a
rule he created the companies, and in some of them
he didn’t really invest anything, while in others
he only invested borrowed funds which he took
out of other companies, and in most instanees
the money which he invested in his companies
wasn’t a circumstance to the amounts which he got out
of them. The attempt to paint Matthew as a spotless
lamb who foolishly deposited his own solid private fortune
in unlucky companies, is a flue example of the way things
get turned upside down when the public has begun to
forget the real inwardness of the situation. So far,
nobody has protested against Madden’s exposition of the
case, a id it would seem as if people were almost ready to
believe that Matthew Davies actually put his own funds,
instead of other people’s, into his ghastly array of burst-
up banks.

Premier Turner involves himself in anomalies
when he adopts the municipal valuations as his basis.
The assessment of unimproved values as 50 per cent, of
the whole capital value may average up all right, hut it
will deal out endless individual injustices. The direction
of least resistance is valuation by the owner, with the
governmental option of purchase. The admission of
municipal valuations, without any cheeky or safeguard,

A Coolgardie correspondent of The Bulle-
tin:—Not so long ago there was placed upon London
market a certain “ Empress of Coolgardie mine,” No one
knew where the property was located, but since it has
been floated for £90,000 it has leaked nut that said pro-
perty is comprised in two leases—one known as the “ Ben
Nevis.” the other as the “Iron Duke.” Were the two
offered for sale in Coolgardie to-day, they would realise—
well, 1 wish the English shareholders luck. It will be a
perfect hair-raiser for them.
The Carbine mine, 10 miles N. of the Wealth of
Nations, is exciting attention at Coolgardie; 300 oz. of
sp“cimen3 are reported, taken from a hole 6ft. square.
This ought to be quite enough to float the mine for
£1,000,000, if a few members of the British peerage will
take an interest in the matter. To a pot-hole plus a pot-
hat anything is possible.
Twenty W.A. mining companies floated in
London, recently, with a nominal capital of £1,722,000,
have paid £1,289,000 to vendors, while £433,000—a good
deal less than one-fourth—goes to develop the properties.
And even of that £433,000 probably not much more than
the odd thousands will ever actually reach the mines.

Malcolm Fraser, K.C.M.G., has lent his name

have attended the dinner which prefaced the bringing
out of the Great Boulder Mine, and the subsequent send-
off to Zeb Lane. Two years from now, Mr. Fraser may
have cause to bite his fingers.

It is the vogue with Sydney softgoodsmen to
insist that every on engagement, shall sign an
agreement covenanting himself as liable to bo discharged
at a moment’s notice. ” Your services are no longer

wages ny the week, and, when choosing to retrench a man
without a week’s notice, merely pay him a day’s wages.

The people who will come out best from the

late Dr. Moreing, of Braidvvood, N.S.W., and is a cousin
of Randolph Want. He is a nice little fellow, and a
capable mining engineer.

Editor Bulletin,—The reasons why the price of
antimony varies so in the Australian and London mar-
kets .... „
1. The antimony of commerce is “star antimony', a
product of crude antimony mixed with oxide of antimony,
tin clippings, and miscellaneous trifles ; but as the star
market is controlled by a “ ring,” which carefully leaves
a 30 per cent, margin, they are an important factor.
2. Crude antimony being only 70 per cent, metal (bal-
ance pure sulphur), and the metal easily oxidizing
(vaporising), it takes about 2 l-sth tons of metallic crude
to provide one ton of star.
3. Every smelting means loss of metal.
4. Three tons of 50 per cent, sulphide ore give roughly
one ton of crude antimony.
That, summed up, means that in one ton of star metal
there are 2j of crude or j\ tons of 50 per cent. ore. This,
mark you, without allowing any profit on smelting other
than the product of oxide obtained from the flues—the
same oxide being valueless here and mighty hard to dis-
pose of on the London market.—Sardine.

Christmas, of “ Christmas’s Patent Gold Ex-
tractor,” which is now under trial, is a Broken Hill
haker, who claims to deal effectively with fine-gold
stone and auriferous antimony. His principle is that
lead is heavier than antimony, and lead and gold have
affinity. Melt your antimony ore; throw in a little
lead and let it cool, when from the bottom of the cake
the lead, containing the gold, can be easily knocked
off the antimony, and the gold then got out of the
lead. Christmas-who tried the Pambula stone, hut
owns to a failure —has now taken a Vic. auriferous
antimony mine on tribute.

An example of luck. Two miners were going
down the New Pinafore mine (Tas.), the other day, when
something went wrong and they dropped 170 ft., 1300 ft.
of rope falling on top of them. They weren’t hurt. When
your nuzzle is in you can drop about a quarter of a mile
with impunity, and when it is out you can’t step on the
smallest kind of a tack without setting up blood-poisoning.
And at Bendigo, two miners fell in a cage 1800 ft., and one
was not killed.

and hares at 725. per dozen ; while only 4s. and 6s.

so there was a profit of Is. lid. each on rabbits

Sydney Telegraph is particularly amazing
when it gets on the subject of foreign politics. In
a recent leading article it announces that
“ Sweden and Norway thus both threatened (by
Russia) and equally prizing their independence . .
for purposes of mutual defence, decided to unite
their forces. . . The union had its origin in the
fear of Russian aggression.” The customary
historical account is that Norway—which hadn’t
possessed any shadow of independence for nearly
two centuries —was taken from Denmark and
given to Sweden by the Great Powers, Russia in-
cluded, as the price of Bernadotte’s assistance
against Napoleon, and that Sweden had to man
down Norway by force of arms before she could
enter into possession. But the Telegraph's
history, like its Freetrade statistics, resembles no
other history upon the face of this earth.

“ IMITATION
is the
SINCEREST FLATTERY.”
The articles most imitated are
CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS.
WHY?
BECAUSE they have the best reputation and
are most in demand by the public, consequently,
every dishonest trader tries to trade on their fame
and renown.
It is really wonderful that the Australian people
are so slow to see the truth as regards the un-
scrupulous quacks and charlatans, who prey on
the credulity of the Australian public. Scarcely a
week ever passes but what the press exposes the
barefaced and shameful practices of some of these
harpies, yet in face of all they seem to thrive, and
the paper which hounds them down most thrives
fattest on their advertisements and cracks cham-
pagne over each balance-sheet. Clements Tonic
and Fletcher’s Pills have never yet stooped to
deception and misrepresentation. They are
scientific therapeutical agents, and evidence as to
their value can be found in every district, and
such being the case it is unnecessary to further
extol their virtues.

Miss Katharine Hardy,
now playing with Maggie
Moore’s “Little Jack Shep-
pard” at Melb. Royal, is a
young lady blessed with a
pretty face, graceful figure,
and pure soprano voice. Miss
Hardy was born in England
and went to Maoriland a few
years back, where she soon
built up a reputation as a con-
cert-singer. In a representa-
tion of Mozart’s "Marriage
of Figaro ” at the Mozart
Centenary Festival of ’92 she
attracted the attention of Mel-
bournians, and since then she
has steadily worked her way
ahead. She played success-
fully in the brief season of
“The Adventuress” at Melb.
Bijou, and took part in
“Skipped by the Light of
the Moon,” and other produc-
tions. Miss Hardy scored as
leading lady with Walter
Bentley in his M.L. tour of
’92, and while with Manning’s
Opera Co. this year in the
Gulden West was warmly re-
ceived at Perth ; after the
opera season she played in a
couple of pieces with Jennie
Lee. Within the last few
weeks she has appeared at
Melb. Exhibition concerts and
made a distinct hit by her
genuinely artistic singing.
Miss Hardy’s present rdle at
the Royal does not give much
scope to her abilities, but what
she does is done well. She has
been unfortunate in the past
in being connected with some
badly-paying ventures, but it
is hoped that the Mascotte of
good luck which Maggie Moore
possesses will come within the
reach of the lady now support-
ing her. To the ad vantages of
superior personal charms Mias
Hardy adds refinement, intelli-
igence, and excellent conversa-
tional powers. With proper
opportunities, a bright operatic
career awaits her.

Mrs. Besant will probably be writing an
article for one of the English reviews on some

singularly enough, with the extreme forwardness

their extraordinary backwardness in general cul-
ture and scientific knowledge, as compared with
the inhabitants of the large Australian cities.
The late Dean Macartney, of Melbourne,
would never go through Fitzroy Gardena, though
he lived near them, and the way through was his
nearest route to the city—because he looked upon
the statuary as morally injurious. The morals of
an old gentleman of 90 don’t matter much, but he
thought the question important, and he always
impressed upon his women-folk and servants that
they were not to go through either for the same
reason.

to go to the law, and he became a pupil in Hodges’
chambers. O’Hara, however, found he had no

tinacious young men addresses the elder as “Mr.

tinction marks a wide difference in ability.

self that he can estimate to within a fiver the
value of any security, no matter how extensive,

had to take over any property on which he has

him reading

a heap of official

them.” No sooner said than done, and the
Caesarean Duncan calmly went through the papers,
and wrote official minutes for the Colonial
Secretary of N.S.W., to all of which the great
statesman put his initials.
It is related of a certain N.S.W. railway
magnate that, returning home one night in
the tram, he noticed that the windows dividing
the smoking carriage were covered with dust.
He said sharply to the conductor, “You don’t
keep your carriages very clean on this suburb!”
The guard, somewhat put out after a long day’s
work, and not recognising the magnate, answered
sharply, “ Mind your own business.” When
the magnate and his friends got out, those who
remained in the carriage were chuckling every
time the guard passed. At last this aroused his
attention, and he asked what they were laughing
at. They pointed to the window, on the pane of
which the magnate had traced with his finger, in
the dust, “Blank, commissioner for railways.”
Truly a superfine sense of humor !
Dick Seddon, the six-foot M.L. Premier,
was a most uncouth customer when first sent to
Parliament by the Knrnara diggers. In his first
speech he wrestled with the word “schedule,”
which he dubbed “skeddle,” The word has
stuck, and has been adopted by many members as
the more convenient form of pronunciation. Dick
detested the late Vincent Pyke. Once in the
small hours during a stonewall debate, when
members were lying about in blankets on the
benches, more or less drunk and snarly, little
podgy Vincent was helping his side by a general
discourse. Suddenly Seddon electrified the
drunken and half -awake crowd by shouting out in
a deep bass, “You’re a -liar!” The Speaker’s
attention was drawn to this, but he said he didn’t
hear it, and it suddenly dawned on everybody
that it was best to let the matter drop. Pyke
was boiling and purple. He went out into the
lobby, got a big stick and lay in wait for his
elephantine antagonist; but Seddon, being warned,
stayed in the house, and friends after a while
managed to get Pyke away to bed.

faithfully than ever, for he hates cigarettes. In
Germany he thinks a cigar now and then will do
him no harm. In Switzerland his pipe seems,
somehow or other, to drop completely into
oblivion, and wherever you meet him there you
will find him with a look of contentment beaming
on his face, and a Frossard’s Cavour in his mouth.
These cigars have now been brought out to Aus-
tralia, and can be had at all tobacconists at the
price of only one shilling for a packet of eight.
They are mild and aromatic, and better value has
never yet been given.

POLITICAL POINTS
Throttled liberty gasps out riots.
The R.C. representation in Vic. Assembly
increased from 7 to 17 at the general elections.
Ex-Premier Patterson has the gall to tell
the Vic. Assembly that a tax on land values is an
“unheard-of ” proposal.
Premier Kingston, having failed to induce
Vic. Premier Turner to settle the boundary ques-
tion, will shortly force the dispute into the law-
courts.
The time has long come for a democratic
daily in Melbourne, and the opening for a live
evening paper is surely a sufficiently tempting
chance.
It is whispered in the innermost temples
of Victorian politics that the alternative to the
acceptance of Turner’s taxation proposals is
Repudiation.
“Wanted—an invention to prevent a mort-
gagee adding the amount of any possible land-tax
to the mortgagor’s interest when the latter wants
a renewal.” This is where a State Land Bank
would come in.
In a Police-court case recently heard in a
little Maori land town, one of the J.sP. on the
Bench was the father of the plaintiff’s lawyer and
the other was his father-in-law. N.B.—The
plaintiff won.
Berry-Service, Griffith-M ‘ll wraith, Parkes-
Robertson : why should a Parkes-Dibbs coalition
be considered impossible in Australian politics?
That such a coalition would be immoral doesn’t
affect the matter.
The field-night given by N.S.W. Assem-
bly to Australian Federation—a reckless waste of
time —was merely an expensive sop to the uncurb-
able vanity to H. Parkes. Federation is once
more “ in the hair.”
Counting pairs, the first test division, that
approximately defined the state of parties for and
against the Reid Government in N.S.W., took
place last week, the figures being 69 and 27
respectively. Only 28 members were absent.
“Land,” says the Argus, “is the raw
material of all our exporting industries. There-
fore, land should be taxed as little as the neces-
sities of the State will allow.” No. Therefore,
it should be taxed so heavily as to make the use
of the material by the industrious absolutely im-
perative.
Q. Govt, now holds
aloof from Federation.
Federation means united
action to exclude cheap
labor, and Boodle-
wraith and its banks are
flourishing on cheap
labor. Nelson and Co. are
content that the cause of
Democracy and of Aus-
tralia should perish so
long as their greed is
glutted.
Few things have
made the Sydney
Foreign-trade press feel
worse of late than
MMillan’s speech on the
financial statement. In
it he pointed out that
the DibbsGovt. deserved
well of the country for
the immense reductions
which it made in the
expenditure ; that the
practice alleged by Pre-
mier Reid of cutting
down the estimates of
expenditure to make a
bogus surplus, and then
demanding large sums on
the supplementary esti-
mates to make things
square, was mostly flam,
said supplementary esti-
mates last year being
only £300,000 ; and that
the promised limiting of
the unauthorised expen-
diture to .£50,000 was
foolish and impracticable.
All which, and especially
the statement that the
late Protectionist Govt,
had “saved the country
in its hour of peril,” has
made the Foreign trade
press gnash its best Sun-
day teeth.
The tone of H. Parkes’s latest federation
speech :
And, Believing myself a loyal subject of the greatest
Sovereign that ever lived—my Queen— I cannot but
be anxious about the future of the Empire of which we
form a part.
Attorney-General Simpson and Premier
Reid are the only opponents to Local Option with-
out compensation in present N.S.W. Cabinet, and
yet, under a professed system of government by
majority, the voices of these two will swamp the
influence of eight other Ministers.
The sanctified Professor Rentoul denies
“with a thousand noes ” that Christ came as a
social reformer. “If he had come as such,
whoops the affluent Vic. saint, “ His effort would
have perished impotent! ” Even the Lord ceases
to be Almighty pitted against “ proputty ” and
privilege.
S.A. Legislative Council passed Kingston’s
Progressive Tax Bill by 12 votes to 9, included in
the majority being the six labor members and
Russell and Bice who displaced confirmed
Tories. S.A. Council is in reality much more
democratic and representative than the unwieldy
Assembly.
A while ago it was W. J. Lyne who,
according to babbling rumor, stood barefooted
waiting to jump into N.S.W. Railway Commis-
sioner Eddy’s boots; now the same authority
gives the pose and yearning to Minister Young.
Something in the air of the Public Works Depart-
ment accounts for these noisy guesses.
Lawyers, who are members of the strongest
trades-union in the world, are the most strenuous
opponents of trades-unionism. They are, also,
almost the only people who are insured a minimum
wage by the laws of the country, and are —shall
we say therefore?— out-and-out in their protests
against the layman getting a minimum wage.
Monseigneur Couppd, R.C. Bishop of New
Britain, now visiting Sydney, is a plain-spoken
opponent of black-labor recruiting systems, and
attributes to the deportation of islanders most of
the native crime. He reckons that 70 to 75 out
of every 100 New Britishers recruited for New
Guinea die before their contract is completed.
Several of Parkes’s friends contend chat
bis late speeches in debate prove his intellect up
to the level of 15 years ago, and with the conten-
tion suggest his prime fitness for leadership as
soon as an opening can be made. So far as Parkes
himself is concerned he thinks that for alertness
and brightness he is an improvement on 30 years
ago.
N.S. W. Parliamentary Elections and Quali-
fications Committee should at once be made a
non-political tribunal. Look, for instance, at the
false position occupied by member Crick. At one
time, he sits in judgment on the case of his
deadly enemy, Black; at another, he helps to
decide the political fate of his friend and quondam
partner, Willis.
Varney Parkes, in throwing up his seat
on N.S.W. Public Works Committee, sacrifices
an average of £l2 12s. a week.. Some years ago
he resigned his seat in Parliament to devote him-
self, as he said, to money-making by his profes-
sion, and it appears that either he has been suc-
cessful, or the offences of the Works Committee
must smell rankly to him.
Certain Protectionist authorities vow that
if the Reid Government allows party animus to
influence it in discharging Protectionist pro-
teges from N.S.W. public service, Protectionists
will, when the wheel turns, behave similarly
towards Freetrade proteges. This would be a
natural exercise of lex talionis, but why should the
country submit to either party having proteges?
In Banaualand Parliament, the other day,
Drake raised a point of order that the amendment
providing a subsidy of £lO,OOO for the rabbit fund
was not covered by the Appropriation Act, and
therefore out of order. Thereupon Annear :
“This is a legal question raised by a legal member.
T * Link I will be right in ruling, feeling as I <1
ON THE SAFE SIDE.
NIECE (who is fond of racing): “ The law is ridiculously strict.
Did you ever know an or dinary sweep to do anyone
any real harm?”
HER MAIDEN AUNT: "They never hurt me, but then I don’t trust
them too far, and I never give them any beer."
that the Ministry of the day would never do any
thing of a hunconstitutional character, that this
motion is out of border.” Superb !
The endowment clauses of Premier Reid’s
Local Government Bill will, if passed in their
present state, stimulate instead of killing off the
Parliamentary chances of the local alderman.
The man whose qualification for a seat in the
House is that he will work to get a gaol built in
his district appears to be expressly provided for
in the bill, whereas he should have been once for
all exterminated.
All the Labor-members in S.A. Assembly-
voted against the granting of a license to sell in-
toxicating liquors on Lake Bonney (Govt.) Irriga-
tion Settlement unless at the request of the
majority of the adult residents. They were
beaten, however, the chief argument on the other
side being that, as the settlers were to grow grapes
and make wine, it would be inconsistent to pro-
hibit them from drinking it.
Cook and Son, the excursionists’ agents,
have been raking in over £lOO a month clear
profit out of the sale of Vic. railway tickets, a
concession granted them by Dickey Speight and
Dunk Gillies. Considering that the chief business
of the Railway Dept, is to sell tickets, for which
purpose it keeps an immense staff that spends a
good deal of its time reading American dime-
novels, the idea of subsidising a rival concern is
characteristic of Gillies. The present Govern-
ment has discharged Cook and Co., and the Rail
way Dept, is now expected to mind its own
business.
HONESTY REPULSED.
SHE: “ Don’t you think you had better allow me to take charge of that stray
fowl and advertise for its rightful owner, my boy?
SMALL BOY: “No yer don’t, lady. I know yer little game. Just go and buy
yer own ’at feathers, and not come yer confidence dodges on
’spectable persons. ”
Two nominee Upper Houses crushed
Lower House decisions in a similarly emphatic
way last week. Queensland Legislative Council,
by the balance of the House to two members,
killed the Lower House resolution in favor of an
increased Payment of Members, and N.S.W.
Legislative Council, also by all votes against two,
quashed the Assembly decisions in favor of the
Eight Hours clause in the Mining Bill.
A certain very democratic Southern poli-
tician is prepared to defend the theory that it is
against the national good that any Australian-
born politician should be allowed to power
who has ever visited England. Did Washington,
he asks, ever visit England ? Did Jefferson ? And
has not up to date almost every Australian poli-
tician who has ever visited England been hope-
le sly corrupted from a national-republican point
of view ?
Premier Reid’s income-tax exempts in-
comes derived from N.S.W. Govt, debentures,
'provided such debentures are not held by per-
sons resident in the province.” The absentee
debenture-holder is to get his interest intact,
while the ordinary “ colonial ” one gets his less
income-tax! Therefore, it comes to the same
tiling as offering a higher rate of interest to the
foreign investor than to the Australian one. This
is Protection turned upside down with a venge-
ance.
The fact that W. Wynne, of Sydney D.T.,
and D. Syme, of Melb. Age, were willing to take
up 20,000 shares of the defunct Melb. Standard,
to prevent its assimilation by the Herald, would
tend to prove that the greed of enterprise unites
strange comrades. Wynne is the outward
sign of foreign-trade in the N.S.W. press ; Syme
is the roaring dictator of protection in Victoria.
Was the proposed revivified Standard to have
grog-blossomed out as a “ freetectionprotrading ”
Janus ?
The S. M. Herald’s idea of fair play.
Haynes, M.L.A., in the recent N.S.W. Assembly
Federation debate, made a long speech against the
dead-and-buried Convention Bill. The Herald
compressed it into four lines in its report.
M’Millan replied as forcibly as he knew bow. The
Herald gave him nearly half-a-column of its
valuable space. It is not necessary to agree with
Haynes to see the monstrous injustice of this and
denounce it.
*Gov. Duff talked a pitiful lot of Imperialis-
tic bombast at the Melbourne Mayor’s banquet.
“ No—haw —statesman or candidate for Parlia-
mentary honors could—haw—now appeah before
the English people as an advocate of the—haw-
little England policy.” If Gov. Duff means by
this that no politician in England would stand up
and condemn the “expansion” plunder-and-
blood business, then he simply talked Ass. bray.
Has Gov. Duff never heard, for instance, of Henry
Labouchere ?
Premier Reid, out of sympathy for the
burdens placed upon the poor in N.S.W., is going
to take off his predecessor’s duties upon imported
silks, satins, laces, jewellery, precious stones,
works of art, pianos, &c., &0., and make up part
of the loss by levying a land-tax which comes
down with exactly the same weight upon the
miserable “ cocky ” with 100 acres and the auto-
crat with 100,000. True, the amount at issue
isn’t much, but, none the less, G. Ti. Reid should
stop snuffling about the burdens laid on the poor
man. Also, he should give up calling his parti-
cular land-tax an impost on Wealth, for it is
nothing of the kind.
M‘Millan will not, until he
is financially independent, accept office in any
N.S.W. Government, and considers his deter-
mination a virtuous one. Let us suppose, how-
ever, that an epidemic of such determinations
swept over the land. Where then would the State
be? Probably there are not more than a hundred
financially independent men within the boun-
daries of N.S. Wales, and of these less than ha f-
a-dozen would be returned, or deserve to be
returned, to Parliament at a general election, and
hardly one of them would be fit to be a IVXinister.
And Mr. M’Millan calls himself a patriot.

ment estab-
lished under

tion was a

In the re-
maining is-
lands of the
Cook group,
“ total prohi-
bition ” still
rules, with
the inevitable

result that sly
grog-selling and poisoned liquors flourish every-
where.
One of the chief objections to Premier
Reid’s N.S.W. budget non-proposals was that he
was staving off his promises and postponing his
declared plans of new taxation. Yet, when the
deliverer of his country rushed the Assembly at a
late-early hour in the night-morning with the
introduction in committee of his L an d and In-
come Tax Assessment Bill, there was a general
Opposition howl that his action was too
“previous.” Which provides another choking
satire on “ Government by Contradiction.”
The Foreign-trade S.M. Herald “ blows
cold ” on the tariff fetish it was wont to idolise :
No considerations of so-called principle, which may
mean nothing more than the pur-uit of a dream, should
be allowed to divert the attention of the Government
from the necessity of caution and care in the introduction
of extensive fiscal changes.
The very abandon of candour ! The secret main-
spring of the Herald is that no considerations of
principle, so-called or genuine, should be allowed
to influence anything anyhow, What price the
much-advertised Freetrade conscience?
We now stand at the parting of the ways.
This legal conspiracy to hoist Australian Judges
on to the English Privy Council Bench to hear
Australian appeals in London is an incident of
tremendous importance. Shall we, by sending
not representative members to England’s Parlia-
ment, but what would be more momentous still,
representative Judges to England’s Bench, post-
pone for half-a-century the coming of the inevit-
able Australian national-republican final Court of
Appeal? The present lawyers’ conspiracy involves
a big step towards Imperial Federation ; an Aus-
tralian final Court of Appeal means the Republic.
The Bulletin confidently leaves the issue to the
Democratic party in every Australian province,
Salomons, ex-Vice-President of N.S.W.
Executive Council, and ex-Chief Justice, backed
up by the whole force of the Crown Law Office,
appeared before N.S.W. Banco Court, last week,
to argue in support of an appeal, in the case
known as “Watt and Gilchrist and the Crown
Lands Act of ’B4 and ’B9 and the Court, after
listening to Salomons’ long speech, unanimously
dismissed the appeal, without calling upon the
other side for a word in rebuttal. Darley, C. J.,
said there was not a particle of ground on which
to rest the appeal; Windeyer, J., fully concurred
with that opinion, and Innes, J., remarked that
“really the case was too clear for argument.”
Yet there were Salomons and Canaway and
Rogers and Pike, in wig, and Ellis and Button
and three or four other solicitors, all down for
fees in the case, and the country must foot the
bill.

that he was not speaking tho truth. His Honor added that he

At Kempsey (N.S.W.) police court, on
Nov. 13, before Sutherland, Bond and Clarke,
Js.P., Hill, J.P., was found not guilty of allowing
his horse to stray on the highway. Then, before
Hill, J.P , Sutherland, J.P. got a verdict in the
case of a workman who sued him for wages. Ap-
parently, the Kempsey justices—like most other
justices—are kept pretty busy finding verdicts in
each other’s case*. The spectacle of a J.P. de-
ciding a case in favor of another J.P., and then
getting down off the bench to appear as defendant
while the other defendant climbs up and promptly
hears his case, is (without necessarily imputing
dishonesty to any member of the Bench) one of
several hundred things which go to make J.P.-ism
a scandal to any civilised community.

Five J.sP., constituting the Magisterial

Magisterial Bench at Picton, urging the latter to
use clemency towards a youth accused of larceny
and coining up for trial, the ground on which the
petition was based being that the youth’s parents
were respectable and had lived many years in
Bowral. The Picton Bench fined the lad 405.,
with an alternative of 14 days’ imprisonment.

An incident happened last week in Auck-
land (M.L.), which finished the story of the once-
notorious Probert will-case. Old Probert died
some three or four years ago, leaving a good-siz d
fortune and an aged, crippled and penniless
brother. He left the brother .£lOO and the
balance —over .£20,000 —to the Wesleyan Church.
The surviving Probert went round feebly for a
while on two dotty legs, trying to demonstrate to
the Wesleyan Church that it might, in common
decency, allow him, say, .£lOO per annum for life
out of the .£BOO or .£lO9O a year income realised
from the bequest, but the church—as trustee for
“ Gawd ” —declined to see it, and at last the
matter dropped. Last week, having got through
his legacy, the piralytio brother hanged himself,
which ends the story. According to all the rules
of poetic justice he should have done his final
asphyxiation in the Wesleyan church, but pro-
bably he was too weak to get so far, or possibly
le church was locked and he couldn’t get in.

The Duke of Norfolk is a sort of lay Pope
in England. He tried to get another Saxon
appointed to Sydney when Archbishop Vaughan
died, but Pope Leo sent out Dr. Patrick Moran.
Then Melbourne was to have a coadjutor, and
Norfolk was at it again. He tried to have Lord
Archibald Douglas, brother of Florence Dixie and
of Queensberry, the boxing man, sent out, but
Archbishop Goold wouldn’t have him on any
account. Then Dr. Goold died unexpectedly, and

The Akgus Brisbane correspondent wires :
Queensland Meat Export Co. has received the following
cable message : “Duke of Argyll's hind-quarters selling

American heiresses have hitherto been free buyers
of British aristocracy (by the carcase), and The
Bulletin can only account for the low prices
alised in London for the primest portion of His
Grace’s anatomy by assuming that Argyll’s Ugly
red hair and freckles were not confined to his head
only, or that he had indulged too freely in
scratching-posts and thereby damaged his meat.
Anyhow, it’s satisfactory to know that even the
very choicest brand of “ long pig ” can be bought
in London at half the price per pound of guaran-
teed-genuine pork sausages.

The blacks of Westralia have “ foully
murdered ” a Christian constable for no con-
ceivable cause, except that he had 17 natives on
the chain and was driving them off to prison.
Perhaps the poor ignorant beasts imagined a
personal grievance against the foreign person who
was enforcing the principles of law’norder. Any-
how, the duty of the Westralian Government is
clear. The local tribes must be exterminated
forthwith. The process of removing them to the
haunts of civilisation in chained batches might
presently result in the loss of another valuable
policeman. Killing’s the only cure for native in-
subordination.

Fifteen murders were committed in Vic-
toria during the first ten months of 1894. The
universal poverty and wretchedness which fol-
lowed the bursting of the boom, and the outbreak
of hysterical religion which came on top of the
financial disasters, are the only apparent causes
of this unusual outbreak of violence. So, thfe
ghosts of the dead may be fairly distributed
among certain distinguish! d boornsters and bank-
managers, many of whom have lately been white-
washed ; a spectre and a-half may also be allowed
to roost on the doorstep of Muokneill & Co. The
balance may be set down to drink, jealousy, and
original sin, as usual.

Awhile ago a Chinaman, suspected of being
leprous, was quarantined at Port Augusta (S. A.)
hospital, but a medical expert subsequently pro-
nounced the disease to be of another character,
and John, since August last, has been hawking
vegetables around Adelaide A few days ago,
however, he was again examined, and grave doubts
arise as to whether it is not leprosy after all. So
far, this last feature of the case has been kept out
of the daily press.

Dear Bulletin, —“ Max O’Rell ” only
follows stereotyped Hinglish spleen (unwisely
encouraged, it is true, by loose Australian scrib-
blers who aim only to achieve a passing wheeze)
in vividly accentuating “ larrikinism ” as a vicious
trait indigenous only to the Australian character.
The approach of the Christmas season reminds
me of the vogues that were prevalent in my
juvenile days, at this time of the year, among
that much-belauded sample of cub-humanity—the
English schoolboy. How many Bulletin readers
will remember the pranks they played as school-
boys on the three Sundays preceding the half-
yearly “breaking-up.” The first Sundiv was
“ Churchwood Sunday.” On that 1 iy, •• \• iy buy
was pledged, under penalty of being kicked
and cuffed and pinched mercilessly by every
other boy during the interval between church
and dinner, to bring a\yay with him a
piece of timber out of the church gallery.
The lad who could wrench, put a staircase-ban-
nister and march off with it inside a leg of his
trousers was a hero ! What was this? ■ Larrikm-
ism? No feah —British playfulness,dontcherknow!
The next Sunday was “Gob Sunday,” when every
boy (and they numbered about 90) w|§' -required
to spit in as nearly exactly the Same spot as every
other boy on the last step of the church-gallery
staircase. Was this larrikinism? Oh, dear no—
British humah, dontcherknow ! The last Sunday
was “ Runaway Sunday the routine being that,
when the boys were ordered to >“ form fours ” to
march back to school, they and all bolted.
Not larrikinism, deah boy—only British playful-
ness, dontcherknow, meah/ animal spiwits.—
Yours, Dipso.

Just prior to the opening of the first match
in Adelaide, the S.A. Advertiser published a
leader explaining to “ Mr.” Stoddart the reason
why, in reporting the doings of his eleven on Aus-
tralian soil, the English habit of differentiating
between the amateur and the professional will not
be adopted.

Prior to Dr. Kennion’s departure from
Adelaide to take the see of Bath and Wells, the
local clergy of all denominations joined together
to mumble eulogies concerning his S.A. career.
His first cabled utterance in England is a thanks-
giving for the State Church and a condemnation
of the bitter sectarian jealousies and feuds by the
long wash of Australasian seas.

JcS.W. “Native Flora Protection Bill,”
prohibiting wild-flower shows and selling, and
punishing destruction of plants, is right in essence,
but goes a little too far. It should be made clear
that merely to pluck flowers on unenclosed land,
if not for sale, is not illegal; otherwise no pic-
nicker will be safe.

Australian “loyalty” again. Behind the
dais occupied by Gov. Gormanston at the opening
of Tas. Exhibition, was hung a screen decorated
with unionjacks and ensigns and royal standards
and similardrapery. Unluckily, this interfered with
the view of the choristers, who protested that they
hadn’t dressed themselves nicely in white uni-
forms with blue and red sashes in order to be
hidden from public approval by any flags
whatever. The directory at first refused to
remove tne screen, and the choir was just
about to lay violent hands on it when work-
men were sent to pull down the glorious relics
of the battle and the breeze. Then the choir
smoothed down its whiteuniforms and straightened
up its red and blue sashes, and smiled at the
audience, and the audience applauded and smiled
back-;* and-when. Gov, Gormanston did the open*
ing a few minutes later he had to knock out tin
most effective period in the speech he had learnt,
because he couldn’t strike an attitude and point to
the trophy of flags. But the choir sang with
much feeling a cantata commencing
Here no din of war affrights us ;
Here no sounds of strife resound ;
and the next time an Australian Exhibition
directory wants to display the insignia of Austra-
lian “ loyalty ”it will take care to hang them up
on the rafters out of the way.

The girls who dispense tea and tarts at a
large Sydney refreshment-room state that it is nob
uncommon for “lady” customers to steal the
natty milk-jugs and sugar-basins, and frequently
the miniature teapots. In the absence of a bag an
umbrella is the “ trap ” used.
“The worst and cleverest prisoners are
the first to make friends with the gaol-chaplain
and get into his good graces, and work on the
good feelings of those they meet to deceive
them,” says Judge Backhouse (N.S.
Wales). Yes, and it is equally
true that the least criminal
prisoner, the most manly con-
vict, the honest blunderer, or
the least hypocritical offender
with at all events the courage
of defiance, is the man who chafes
uncontrollably under restraint, who makes
breaches in gaol-regulations, and incautiously
vents “disrespectful” language at some
warder who is far and away beneath even
the prison grade of manhood, and becomes
the “ incorrigible ” who gets flogged and
has every redeeming point cut out of him
piecemeal by the murderous flagellator, the
bowelless instrument of a bloody system.
The Redfern accident has recalled to many
Melbournians a narrow escape from a similar dis-
aster which occurred at Eliuders-street station on
the7th March, ’B7. One train was timed to leave
as soon as another, the packed 9 o’clock Brighton
express, arrived. It happened that the express
was a few minutes late, and the driver of the
ordinary train, by mere mechanical force of habit,
moved out at his usual time. He had just got his
train across the track of the express as the latter
approached. In five seconds a frightful collision
would have occurred, but luckily the signalman
saw the danger, and, rushing through the window
of his box, he stood between the approaching
trains, red flag in hand, and just saved the im-
pact. Commissioners Speight and Greene, En-
gineer of Existing Lines Lunt, Assistant Traffic
Manager Francis, and Exhibition Secretary
Lavater were in the front van, and, with their
hearts in their mouths, saw the whole thing. A
very secret enquiry was held, with the result that
the driver of the ordinary train was heavily
punished, while the signalman, whose act had
saved a great loss of life and at least .£50,000, was
awarded .£5. About a fortnight after the Melb.
Herald scented out and published all the facts,
the other papers followed suit, and that was the
first hint the passengers got of what they had
escaped.
“ Z.” ; Apropos the statement of N.S.W.
Rail way Dept, that it isimpossihlefor the interlock-
ing gear to get out of order. 3orne four years ago,
when driver Bertram was killed at Cleveland-st.
tunnel, the Dept, then admitted that the fatality
was caused by faulty interlocking apparatus, and
paid Bertram’s mother something like .£6OO as
compensation. On that occasion the deceased
was taking a goods train to Darling Harbor when
an engine proceeding to Eveleigh ran into him.
Both drivers had their correct signals, but owing
to the interlocking gear failing to act the goods
train and engine collided, causing the instant
death of Bertram and extensive damage to rolling
stock. Also, at the Departmental enquiry on the
recent Redfern smash, the signalman stated that
about a quarter to nine he drank a cup of water,
and from that time till after the accident he felt
as if he was in a kind of haze and everything
seemed a blank to him. These facts were not
mentioned at the coroner’s inquest,

The story goes that a N.S.W. railway in-
spector the other night found three pointsmen
asleep, and that the cause was liquor.

There is to be a vitriolic contest for
Adelaide mayoralty this year between Willcox,
present Mayor, and Aldermen Skethaway and
Tucker. The latter will probably be elected, as
he will spend much money, but his chances have
been much damaged by a public declaration of
Grainger, M.P., that Tucker was his greatest
friend.
# * #
Miller, M.P., proposes, in his new Bill for
the destruction of N.S.W. legal nepotism, to pass
a clause making a son-in-law a “ blood relation.”
This is the toughest job the present Parliament
has had before it, and is even beyond the region
of things that Reid—that wholesale promiser—
might be expected to take in hand.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
This day waning—white is the stone that marks
it —
Gave me once thy heart to be mine, beloved,
Mine by love’s constraint that will hold us hence-
forth
One, till the night fall.
Lift to mine true eyes, and upon my bosom
Leaning all that burthen of tender beauty,
Bid thy heart speak once in its own clear language
Softly, to my heart.
Lurks no cloud, no Shadow in love’s bright
heaven ?
Threats no blighting wind blowing chill from
southward,
Love’s warm roses? Heart of my heart, speak
truly:
Am I not near thee ?
Me from old time sway’d with a charm all-
powerful,
Beauty; fear’st thou, sweet, lest the swift years
rob thee,
With that youthful grace, of the man’s strong
passion
Now at thy white feet ?
Somewhile cross’d with doubt —is it not so?—tell
me,
Lest unequal powers o’ the mind, or slighter
Lore of books, one yoke-fellow might from other
Part but a hand-breadth?
Nay, live thou thy life and fulfil thy sweetness,
Thine, not mine. Fear nought; neither grieve
for fleeting
Time, whoso footprints wear butadeeper channel,
Dear, for my heart’s love.

Out of nine little children on board the
Wairarapa, not one was saved. Also, their
mothers, in every ease, were drowned along with
them. The first two boats which got away carried
55 people, and only five of them were females.
The proportion of men among the rescued is more
tinn twice as large as that of children and women.
Altogether, it seems to have been an occasion
when almost everyone looked out for himself.
Sundry weird stories are told about the conduct
of the saved. One of them relates to a woman
who got ashore in a state of absolute nakedness,
and to a passenger with two overcoats on, who
demurred considerably about lending one of them
to a nude fellow-creature. Other fully-dressed
passengers are said to have acted in a similar
fashion. Altogether, there are, so far, very few
redeeming features about the tale of the Wai-
rarapa. # , »
Several persons who had a friend among
the drowned passengers of the Wairarapa first
heard of their loss through the arrival of a good
clergyman, who came with a lugubrious expres-
sion to wail over the sad event. And in at least
one instance, when the ghostly comforter had just
scared a woman almost to death with the news
that some relative or other was among the lost, a
telegram arrived stating that he was safe and
well. One man, whose son was on the wrecked
vessel, concealed the news of the disaster from
his invalid wife until more definite intelligence
would arrive, and was under the painful neces-
sity of personally shoving his ghostly comforter
off the premises, so anxious was that good man to
burst in on the sick woman with the news that
her son was drowned, and to pray for her. Also,
he had to intercept and drive away six or seven
religious old ladies who were all arriving in hot
haste to kill the bereaved mother with the intel-
ligence. As it happened, the presumably dead
man was alive and uninjured, but the incident is
instructive, as showing the inherent ghoulsome-
ness of the ghostly comforter and his tribe.
« * *
The evidence in re the Wairarapa wreck
proves, among other things, that not one person
in a hundred or more can form any reliable esti-
mate of time, even under ordinary circumstances.
And the man who has just been thrown out of his
bunk by a collision, and has stove his head against
the floor, and then has scrambled on deck in the
inky darkness to find the ship a wreck, can no
more estimate time than he can eternity. _ Most
of the passengers and crew, in their evidence,
attempted to form an opinion as to the number of
minutes which elapsed between different events,
and succeeded very badly. One, who seemed
more confident than the others, held that it
was fifteen minutes after the original dis-
aster when the vessel listed. “ How long
have you been sitting in that chair giving
evidence ? ” asked the examining barrister. “Ten
minutes,’’ was the answer. It proved to be nearly
half-an-hour, and then the testifier retired dis-
comfited. The average witness’s estimate of time
is built very much on the plan of that Biblical
chronology which says that A bsolom rebelled for
forty years, and that Ezekiel lay upon his right
side for 390 days. He only knows that he seemed
to have been hanging on to the same piece of
wreckage for eleven weeks or so, and from that
inward feeling he vaguely deduces that he was
there any time from three minutes up to two hours
or a month and a half.
• « •
Somebody—apparently a relative of one
of the Wairarapa victims —writes to a Maoriland
paper, asking that the reporters should suppress
the ghastly items concerning how the sharks ate
great chunks out of the drowned passengers. In
the case of the girl who came ashore naked with
the calf of one leg missing and most of the flesh
torn off her ribs, these details of mutilation, he
points out, don’t help the identification in the
least, and are mere superfluous horrors to add to
the distress of her family. All which is doubtless
logical enough, but then a newspaper is a com-
mercial speculation, and the gnawed girl who
came ashore in the daybreak helps to boom the
circulation, and you might as well try to choke a
tiger off its dinner as to choke an editor off such a
narrative.
Maorilanders are now reflecting on a
ouestion asked of the third officer at the enquiry :
“Had the captain orders to make Auckland
quickly and take passengers down to the N-Z.
Cup meeting?” The reply was that he didn t
think so—they had plenty of time, anyway.

The half-masted-flag-flying foolery during
the protracted funeral of the Czar was run mad
down in Melbourne. Not only did every public
building fly flags for the fortnight, but so did hun-
dreds of stores, pubs., and suburban sheds, ine
storm “ Hoi ” reduced the flags to shrews, but the
Govt, buildings kept on renewing them day by
day. The worst example of the epidemic was the
display of half-masted bunting on Melb. cricket
ground during the match —as if the embalmed em-
peror had been a crack bowler or a patron of the
M.O.C. It is things like this that make the Max
O’Rells of the world laugh at us.|

The Nihilist boast that the dead Czar was
phosphorus-poisoned is not utterly preposterous.
The symptoms of his illness happen to be identical
with those of such poisoning, which exhibits itself
in a general disorder of all the organs, especially
the kidneys.

Elijah Cockroft, hanged at Ballarat the
other day for the murder of Fanny Mott, was
unable to read or write, and savagely ignorant.
“A lasting disgrace to the State,” says Canon
Morris, the parson who directed him to Abra-
ham’s bosom. But Cockroft must have dodged
the State’s Compulsory Education Act in order to
preserve his ignorance, and at least the latter does
not send missionaries with pants for the Papuans.
What did the Church do for Cockroft, anyhow ?
Dear Bulletin,—About

A certain gallant dignitary,
who has just been called on to
explain what is prima-facie a
very ugly piece of sleight-of-
hand over a share-deal, has long
been famous for his aversion to
“nobodies,” which aversion was
much strengthened by an inci-
dent of a few months ago. A
rascally pressman, aware of the
gallant one’s peculiarity, hap-
pened to strike the same rail-
way-carriage as the “majaw,”
who became chatty, mistook the
scribe for a man travelling for
pleasure, don’tcherknow, and
even invited him to call. Just
before, parting the conversation
turned on the state of business
in London, whereupon the news-
paper man incidentally re-
marked that when he was in
London with a whelk-stall he
could not sell “ two hobs’” worth
a night latterly, whilst two years
before he could “ do in ” at least
10s. worth. The major’s face
was a study. He replied ne’er a
word, hurried off and explained
to a crony the same night that
he’d had “a demned narrow
escape. Had chatted with a
fellow I took to be a gentleman
for over an hour, my dear sir !
Got quite familiar with the fel-
low indeed, and, by gad, sir,
what d’ye think he was? A
demned common fish-hawker ! a
costermonger, by gad ! It’s a
lesson to me. I’ll never con-
verse with a strange travelling
companion again.”
New Britain is the latest land to be drawn

A belief in spookism is usually unaccom-
panied by a sense of humor, yet a quartette of
Melb.’s boss spiritualists are probably the most
inveterate adult practical jokers in the province.
Last Christmas they landed with their respective
spouses at a seaside hotel just in time for (imner,
Sitting at the table d’hote the men started address-
ing the ladies present by each other’s names, Mrs.
A becoming Mrs. B, and so on. Hence when
Mr. A was found occupying the same room as Mrs.
B the Social Gimletists of the hostelry held a
mass meeting on the verandah and deputationised
the landlord to cast the infamous eight into the
darkness. The situation was gradually unravelled,
to the discomfiture of the long-lipped puritans.

A deputation of Mormons waited upon
Minister Peacock, at Melbourne, the other day,
to complain because a school-teacher had been
censured for endeavoring to make Latter Day
Saints of State school scholars, and to request the
removal of the restriction in this case. Lity
the Minister could not see his way to adopt the
suggestion of the deputation. At a time when
Woman wants to know why Man doesn t marry
it seems only right that the few amongst the rising
generation who will be disposed to marriage
should be instructed how to make themselves go
as far as possible. It is true that some Victorians,
more or‘less prominent, do their very best to set
themselves up as examples in this respect, but a
few Mormon evangelists in the Education Depart-
ment, if given a free hand, might work wonders
in abolishing the surplus spinsters, and making
the limited supply of husbands go round.

THE JURY'S RIDER.
There crossed the plains last winter, ’mongst hordes of idle
men,
A weary trav’ller worn down very fine,
Whose raes were held together
By a saddle-strap of leather,
With the buckle almost grating on his spine.
For months he’d been existing on the pannikin of flour
The squatter gives (the measure of his sense
Of his duty to his neighbour),
That the man who hawks his labour
May live to crawl beyond the bound’ry-fence.
He was daily getting weaker, yet he gamely struggled on,
Though as slender and as hollow as a reed ;
How he wished the fates would will it
That he’d get a decent billet.
And his stomach be astonished with a feed.
One cold and frosty morning some horsemen, riding out
(They were must’ring lambs for marking) on the plains,
In a paddock, bleak and hilly,
Found a tattered swag and billy,
And this wretched, ragged traveller’s remains.
And they held a sort of inquest on the body at the shed,
With a jury of men working on the run ;
And their verdict, ere they parted,
Was—“ The man died broken-hearted,”
For the ration-bags were empty, every one.
But they added as a rider that “ There must be something
wrong
When working men are travelling in rags
Where endless wool is growing,
And, while flocks of sheep are going
To the * boiling-down,’ men die with empty bags.’
I am Tired!
Sufferers from indigestion and liver complaint are
subject to a continued feeling of drowsiness,
headache, tired, aching limbs, and a general
inclination to languor. These symptoms are due
primarily to a deficient secretion of bile, the
natural cathartic of the liver, which, when secreted
in insufficient quantities, permits the coarse and
fibrous particles of the food and other waste and
poisonous matter from all parts of the system to
become impacted in the duodenum and
intestines, creating a very dangerous condition
which requires instant and proper treatment. An
experience of five years with Clements Tonic has
proved this remedy a specific for such complaints,
and its universal success has resulted in thousands
of imitations being forced on the market; not
because they possess any therapeutic value, for
they are purely speculative ventures. Sufferers
who desire to get relief must insist on having
Clements Tonic. It acts scientifically, has proved
its efficacy irt thousands of cases as effectually as
in that of Mrs. W. Kelhmd, Bega, N.S.W., who
writes on April 26th, 1893 About two years ago
I don’t believe there was a greater sufferer in the
world from neuralgia ; I believe I tried a hundred
different remedies—in fact, everything that was
recommended to me, but without being relieved.
My attention was drawn to Clements Tonic and
the number of cases that had been cured by it—
cases resembling mine. By the time I had finished
three bottles of Clements Tonic I was thoroughly
cured of all neuralgic symptoms, and I have never
had a recurrence of the old complaint. _ I have
recommended it on all occasions. Hoping this
may benefit others who are suffering from the
above complaint.—l am, yours gratefully, Mrs.
W. Kellond, Bega, N.S.W.

SOME SEASONABLE ADVICE.
Physicians in practice have no hesitation in
recommending St. Jacobs oil—which they can do
consistently, as its medicinal virtues are readily
acknowledged by representative sportsmen of
every class all over the world. St. Jacobs oil is
the standard remedy for pain. It has triumphed
over all its rivals, and is the favorite embrocation
among LAWN TENNIS PLAYERS, SPRIN-
TERS, GYMNASTS, CRICKETERS, CY-
CLISTS, FOOTBALLERS, OARSMEN, &o.
St. "Jacobs oil is the most successful liniment ever
submitted to the notice of Australian sportsmen.
It penetrates gently, but quickly ; it soothes per-
fectly ; it heals surely; it cures promptly, per-
manently, and without reaction. Sportsmen, be
advised—never be without a bottle of St. Jacobs
oil. Its price is only 2s. 6d.

JUSTMENT OF WARDS.
His Excellency the Governor, with the advice of
the Executive Council, directs the publication, in
accordance with the “Municipalities Act of 1867,”
of the substance and prayer of a Petition from the
Council of the Municipal District of Five Dock,
representing that the population of that Munici-
pality is now over 1000, and praying for a re-ad-
justment of Wards.
JAMES N. BRUNKER.
The Petitioners state that the Municipal Dis-
trict of Five Dock is at present divided into two
Wards and returns six Aldermen.
That the population now exceeds one thousand,
and consequently the Municipality is entitled to
be divided into three Wards and return nine
Aldermen.
“ Your Petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that
your Excellency will cause the Petition to be dealt
with in accordance with the terms of the said
Municipalities Act, and that such steps as may be
deemed necessary may be taken to increase the
number of Aldermen from six to nine, and that a
re-adjustment of the Wards may be made so that
there be three Wards instead of two as at present,
with a view to the same taking effect at the annual
Municipal elections in February, 1895.” 1

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Another Y.R.O. Cup meeting has come to a bad
end, as far as the publio are concerned. Once more the
least intelligent of holiday backers, looking at the
tangled results of four days' racing, ask themselves
what is to be gathered from it all, and again the still,
small voice of Reason tells them to cease patronising a
gambling entertainment which gives little or no satis-
faction for the money. A seasoned punter doesn’t grieve
over the mere fact of losing at the race, any more than he
objects to paying £1 for a sweep-ticket, which is only
worth 18s. on Taltersall’s own showing. But he objects
to being beaten, time after lime, by circumstances which
cannot be reconciled with the run of respectable racing
11 luck.”
Anyone who cares to waste time in analysing
“ form ” (not forgetting to allow for fair chances and
mischances in the game) at the late Flemington and Caul-
field meetings, and who compares inconsistent perform-
ances at those places with equally' in-and-out running at
Randwick in September, cannot help thinking that
“sport” so destitute of sporting interest must either
amend its ways or perish of public disgust. Glaring
chicanery is not alone responsible for the present condi-
tion of Turf things. Nor is the dearth of capable jockeys
a principal cause for complaint.
The practice of running good horses when they
are not thoroughly well, and not “fancied by the stable,”
is perhaps more disastrous to the public than even the
loading-up of fields with notorious “stiff ’uns.” It is a
practice which enables Ikey to profit by the least foolish
of all punting arguments, viz., the argument that a first-
class performer is always worth consideration. Camoola,
the Derby and Champion winner of '92, was run several
times at Flemington last year when he was quite unfit to
be put before the sporting publio as a reliable candi-
date. Carnage, the “ crack ” three-year-old of 13 months
ago, was sent for this year’s Cup, and again for the
Canterbury Plate, when his owner admittedly considered
him a weak reproduction of the Carnage of old. Even
the “Master of St. Albans,” a straight owner and an
undoubted pattern to the hulk of his fraternity, is not so
much of a sportsman as to be jealous of his horse’s
reputation. The English turf has been kept going all
these years by the class of rich owners who never run
their “ cracks ” unless they are deemed likely to do them-
selves credit. If a Common, or Isinglass, or a Ladas gets
palpably “out of form” he isn’t allowed to face the
almost certain prospect of an ignominious defeat. An
English racing calendar contains a good deal of respect-
able reading, which explains why a Prime Minister is not
ashamed to maintain a connection with the turf. An
Australian calendar, on the other hand, is a book of
ghastly jokes played upon credulous gamblers.
Harvester, Devon, Bruin, and one or two other
of the older horses have performed with reasonable con-
sistency during the late Canlfield-Flemington season. As
for the rest, the betting at Flemington goes to show that
their relative trustworthiness is an impossible matter for
calculation. The average starting price of the winner in
14 handicap races was 10J to 1, 8 of the minor winners
being returned at the stock quotation of “tens,” which
means that the books could have well afforded to lay 20
to 1 against. Not one absolutely first favorite won a
handicap at the whole meeting. In 10 weight-for-age
races the average starling price of the winner was exactly
sto 1. Fortunatus, who started 16 to 1 in a field of six
horses, gave a big lift to this average, but, leaving his
race out of consideraiion,-we have still plenty of evidence
that an Australian punter stands at fully five times the
disadvantage of an English ditto. For whereas in Aus-
tralia the average price against w'eight-for-age starters is
preposterously short, the average price against the winner
shows that the proportion of good horses which run up to
“form ” is preposterously small.

Wallace and The Harvester are already backed
as a double for next Derby and Cup.

In re the assignment of Hon. Donald Wallace’s
estate; the first thought of Australian racing men is
what will become of Carbine? The money market is so
tight in Australia, and outside markets will make such
high bids for such a sire, that it looks as if the mighty
one will become an exile.

Several backers of Arihi for the Maribyrnong
complain bitterly of the cowardice of trie V.R.C. in
declining to make certain bookmakers pay up. One man,
on whose ticket an A, followed by the usual blue wavy
line, was scrawled, applied after the race, but was refused
on the ground that he had backed one of the other A-
initialled nags. He appealed to the Club to enforce its
rules, with the result that, although its own detective
reported against the melallician, the club decided that
the amount must remain unpaid.
• * * •
Judging by the way he carried 13sb. 21b. at
Flemington, Norton was not a bad bargain for Mr. Gollan.

Carnage, who absolutely refused to race on the
first couple of days at Flemington, was persuaded to
show a bit of his old form in the Canterbury Plate on
Steeplechase day. Gough Hogged him from the jump,
and though he was very much in the rear for a mile and a
half, he began to take an interest in things in the last
half-mile and finished second after a brilliant run.
* * * *
After Melb. Cup, there was the usual contingent
who had got Patron straight from the stable. The fact is
that for a Week previous to the race the trainer was trying
to persuade the owner to scratch Patron rather than risk
a breakdown ; and Dawes was trying his best to get his
engagement for Patron cancelled so that he could ride
Tarooola, as, on their track work (Patron, Tarcoola and
Ruenalf worked togeiher), he didn’t fancy the ultimate
winner had a possible chance.

Dear Bulletin, —A record! Mr. Marquess,
sec. for the recently-formed Wyalong Proprietary Racing
Club, acted as secretary, handicapped the horses in each
event (11 items), and on the second day acted as starter,
and sold the winning horses in each cf the Selling-races.
Likewise, he is sole-owner of the course, and had it fit for
racing in a month after taking the matter in hand. —
Yours, WVALONGITB.

How can the average backer expect to win ?
Even A. J.C. handicapper Scarr, who knows more about
“form” probably than any man in Australia, tried his
luck at Flemington lately, and his horses never got home***’
Yet, probably, he would adjust the weights much as
Dakin did.

N.S.W. Postmaster-General Cook has no moral
right to deprive even a bookmaker of an important por-
tion of his civil rights, the use of the post and the tele-
graph-wire, simply because that bookmaker breaks the
law. If a place is kept for gambling purposes the police
have power to practically shut it up. The fact that the
police are too lazy or too corrupt to apply the law
directly, in no wise justifies Mr. Cook’s indirect measures.

match against St. Peters. That total has. since been
beaten, however, by Olem. Hill, who last year hit up 360,
not oat, for the lame college, and under similar condition*.

Both boys, for they are little more, were included in the
S.A. team which met Stoddart’s Eleven. Darling has
done good service in club and interprovincial matches
since he left college, and in a recent interview, published
in the Review of Reviews for October, George Giffen,
when asked to mention some of the most promising
playetsin his own locale, spoke thus of him: —“Darling
is one of the most promising bats we have here. He is a
7ery reliable field, and has plenty of pluck and punish-
in*' power when he gets the bat in his hand.
Mr. Darling’s father, who thinks more of business than of
cricket, lately set up his son as a farmer in the Northern
areas near Port Pirie, but the youth tired of hum-drum
agriculture and yearned for the of the city
and the opportunities to distinguish himself in Us sports.
Two seasons ago, therefore, he left the wheat for the wil-
low and opened a shop for the sale of cricketing material
in the metropolis, having A. S. Waldron, a veteran of the
game, as his partner. He played for North Adelaide club
last year, but has now, like George Giffen, gone over to
the Adelaides. Darling is about 24 years old.
* * * *
If the Richardson-Lockwood lightning bowling
is to be impotent, as Blackham predicted, on hard, true
Australian wickets, the English team can hang their
colors half-mast and prepare to accept defeat with a good
grace. Their fielding at Adelaide was much criticised.
Bad fielding must deepen the failure of the fast bowling.
As batsmen they plaved up to their true form in the first
match-one very big score, another very moderate one—
and on the English average of their chief hope, Richard-
son, they could have won the match. If he is a vain
hope under the altered circumstances—well, where are
they? They dunuo where they are. Until last week an
Australian team had not won a match in which the tall
Surrey man opposed them.
• » * *
Stoddart’s Eleven seems built for sensations.
M’Laren, after his omission from the Adelaide match, was
regarded as one of the “odd men,” and the Melb. papers
agreed in ignoring his pretensions. The Age thought he
would probably stand out of the game with Victoria, and
the Argus found fault with his impulsiveness at practice.
At 12 o’clock, however, M’Laren w’ent first to the wickets
with Ward, and there he remained. The rash amateur,
who was to have stood out, stood most decidedly in. He
appeared on this form the safest and at the same time the
most attractive batsman who has visited Australia since
ever so long ago. M’Laren, against good bowling, may
show plenty of weak points. Against the Victorian
attack he was just immense, slapping and glancing the
ball to the boundary, first on one side of the wicket, then
on the other, and never lifting it at any time in the direc-
tion of a fieldsman. The cheering when he reached his
second hundred couldn’t have been heartier for a local
favorite in the same position.
Just after M’Laren had turned his 150 it looked
long odds against him lasting into the second “century."
Ha was evidently feeling that he had enough of it. Dur-
ing the next quarter of an hour he gave one or two haif-
ohances, and made several questionable strokes. Then
Johnny Briggs brought out another drink to the Lan-
cashire lad, which gave him a'new lease of life. M’Laren
had several drinks through the bleak afternoon, and the
crowd wondered what sort of “tack” he could be par-
taking so freely of.
South Australia’s defeat of England is in reality
a triumph for Geo. Giffen, Little Briggs dramatically
affirmed—at the close of the English second innings—that
Giflen is the greatest cricketer the world has seen, and
the record of the match seems to prove it. Giffen was
very unwell for a week before the match, and was in the
doctor’s hands up to commencing day. The Englishmen
were very down in the mouth over their defeat. S.A. has
a splendid team this year, and on her victory against
England—without a vestige of good luck—how can the
claims of Q. Giffen, Reedman, Lyons, Darling and A. H.
Jarvis—whose wicketkeeping was superb—be ignored
when picking the combined team?
r • • • ♦
Stoddart has a great opinion of J. Darling, the
S.A. left hander, who made 117 against England in S.A.’s
first innings.
* • • *
So far as England v. S, Australia is concerned,
the writer, who saw all the match, is satisfied of several
things. Jones is a faster bowler than Richardson, and,
although not so uniformly straight, is just as good and at
times better. On a good wicket Richardson gets no work
whatever on the ball. Secondly, Stoddart’s best bowlers
on Australian wickets are undoubtedly Peel and Briggs.
Humphreys will hardly earn his tucker. Thirdly, the
pres nt team is not as good as Grace’s crowd, and Aus-
tralia ought to win three of the five test matches, all the
luck being equal. Again, Stoddart’s men do not field as
well as previous teams, nor does Gay fill M’Gregor’s place
behind the sticks.
■ * ♦ •
The English cricketers are having phenomenal
good luck in— winning the toss for choice of play.
♦ * * *
The professionals in the English cricketing team,
now in Australia, get £3OO each for the trip, and all

* • • •
If Humphreys is to be included in the English
Eleven for the test-matches (by desire of the Australian
authorities who are responsible for his coming here at
all), Stoddart will not let the old 'un bowl much, The
Bulletin imagines. Humphreys, on an ordinary Aus-
tralian wicket, is a farce. He can’t bowl them out, and
they needn’t get caught off him if they are content to
smack his lobs with caution. If they do chance to get
caught, the joy has been purchased at a ridiculously high
pri -e in runs, and whether they do, or don’t, the on-
lookers have only one opinion about Humphreys, viz.,
that he’s an absurd item in the game. His failure as a
bowler is nothing compared with his failure as an attrac-
tion for the multitude. Before the tour is through the
multitude will show themselves heartily sick of Sussex
“ lobs.” Meanwhile, which useful mau is to stand out of
the eleven in order that Humphreys may be much worse
than useless in his place ?
• * • •
Briggs has the soul of a comedian, and is per-
petually playing to the gallery— stumping a hundred
Imaginary wickets at the end of a critical run, &c. A bit
Of his real cricket on Saturday against Vic. was, excusably
enough, treated as a joke. He was bowling to H. Trott,
who got the wood on one ball, returning it smartly down
the wickets. Briggs not Only fielded it, but sent it back
like a flash of lightning to the backstop. If Trott had
stirred out of his crease he would have been numbered with
the dead men. Meanwhile the recoil of his smart piece of
fielding left Briggs seated on the turf, where he remained
ft space while the ground rang with laughter and cheers.
* • * •
Humphreys, the lob-bowler, is certainly a start-
ling novelty. He sends five men to the chains, where
they stand like sentries to challenge fours. He leaves one
man in the off, at cover point, and the only man in his
conventional place is the backstop. There is no slip, or
cut, or point, and, of course, no long-stop. When he has
turned the off-theory topsy-turvy, Humphreys takes off
his “sweater ” and hands it to the umpire. As he walks
away to get his run for the first bowl, one notices that
he has quite the gait of an old man. His first delivery
in the Vic. match was to Graham, and made the crowd
laugh, it looked so childlike and bland, but it absolutely
bewildered Graham. The second ball resulted likewise.
The third ball Graham smote mightilv, to long field, for
!• The sentries guarded the fence efficiently. All the
afternoon there was only one “ four ” off Humphreys—
■truck by Laver. Laver tried to give an encore, but a
•entry caught him out.
“On paper,” the N.S. Wales team picked to
tneet the Britishers on Friday is the weakest the province
has put into the field for many a year. Even allowing for
the poor material at hand, the selection people have not
made the most of it.
Turner has not “ come off ” with either bat or
ball for some time past, and should have stood aside for a
good bowler—say, Trickett, Bush, or Hogan. On a sticky
wicket Turner would, no doubt, be well enough, but th‘
is not the time to wager on getting sticky wickets.
W. Richardson, who was not picked in the
original 24 for practice, but was included in the 11 at the
last moment, took the huff and will not play. His per-
formance in taking nine of the powerful Paddington
wickets was, no doubt, the reason of his eleventh-hour
picking, but if the committee are going on those lines an
effort should have been made to get Alec. Bannerman,
who has been playing up to his old form recently.
Given a good wicket, “on paper” the durned
Britishers should stay in for a week against the Sydney
Eleven. However, paper isn’t always cricket.

on its merits at Adelaide.

The President of the Melb. Cricket Club, Mr.
F. Grey Smith, entertained the amateur members of the
Stoddart team at dinner on the night of their arrival.
Judge A’Beckett and Mr. H. C. A. Harrison, Vice-Presi-
dents of the M.0.C., and Mr. Phil. Sheridan, the senior
trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground, were amongst the
guests.
* • ♦ •
M‘Laren, in the English-Vict. match, was at
the wickets 5J hours for his 228 runs. Murdoch’s famous
score of 321 was made against Victoria and occupied 10
hours; Moses, also against Victoria, took a similar time
to compile his 297 not out. M’Laren thus scored 9 runs
per hour faster than Murdoch or Moses, but he did not
approach Mac Donnell’s magnificent 239 in 4 hours. Still
further is he behind the brilliant Massie, who, playing
against Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and scoring
206 out of 265, drove up his second century while his
companions pottered up a feeble 12.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
Sheridan, one of this English Eleven’s managers,
is reported to have said that the team could not be
strengthened. Now, an English Eleven without Grace,
Gunn, Shrewsbury and Jackson is as non-representative
as an Australian Eleven without Turner, Graham, Giffen
and Lyons.

If Turner’s leg hampers him in the forthcoming
match, England v. N.S. W., the latter’s chance will look
blue.

It seems as if Corbett had a lot to do with the
very severe punishment Fitzsimmons dealt out to
Creedon. Corbett had stated that Creedon was a hard
hitter and a very hard man to get on to, and would beat
Fitz. Fitz showed that he found Creedon a very easy man
to get on to, and strengthened his claim to a meeting
with Corbett.

Creedon is matched to meet Jim Hall, but with
Hall in anything like bis old form, Creedon will prove a
plaything for the long ’un.

The Vic. Amateur Champion Sculling-race,
rowed on the Lower Yarra course, 3 miles 330yds., last
Saturday, brought five competitors to the post, all vastly
inferior to the standard of the past half-dozen seasons.
The winner turned up in Wally Dawson, of Ballarat R.C.,
No. 7 in the Wendouree’s ’93 Champion Eight, who sculled
home twenty lengths ahead of W. Hamilton (Civil-service).
The other three were unplaced, so the race, as may be
guessed, was a miserable fiasco from a spectator’s point
of view. Last year the championship was won by Jack
Fitzgerald, who did the unique performance of carrying
off a champion scuiling-raoe in the morning and two
cycling-races in the afternoon.

Every sport has its day. The popularity of
Australian cricket declined; then boat-pulling was on top.
It, too, went down, and footracing got a short turn.
That went'to the dogs, and boxing was taken up for a
year or so. That has gone down, and now cricket has an
innings, with slight signs of a revival in pedestrianism.
The turf has a permanent place in popular favor, and foot-
ball, being a winter game, has no outdoor rival.

Unique sporting case from Hawkes Bay (M.L.).
A horse won an event at a trotting meeting, and the
result-board on the course and the daily papers, besides
placing him first, gave the names of two others as second
and third. In trotting-law if a horse “distances” his
field, i.e., wins by so many yards he gets first and second
money, and there is no second or third “ placed.” In
this case the first horse was objected to as being over the
measurement, and on the stewards measuring him, they
found it was so, and disqualified him. Then the owner of
the second horse applied for the stakes, but the stewards
refused to pay on the ground that the judge had not
placed a second horse. The Owner sued, but in court it
was ruled that as one of the racing rules said “The
decision of the stewards shall be final,” there was no
appeal. Club-footed justice with a vengeance I

The amenities of journalism. The Age
referred to a recent Argus utterance, wherein
Premier Turner was called “anamiable Brigand,
as the scream of “ the Oollins-street bunyip.”
Redmond Barry, the Victorian J udge
who shot Ned Kelly’s bolt, used to say that
the Australian slang word “ shout” was derived
from the expression “paying the shot.’’ But it
more probably owes its origin simply to the term
“shouting,” in the sense of “calling,” for drinks.
Perhaps some Bulletin reader can improve on
both theories ?
“ As a precaution against violence on the
part of those in authority, the people, both in
England and the United States, have set their
faces sternly against the creation of large standing
armies.”—Age. “ There is no harm in the wheels
of political intercourse being thus lubricated, pro-
vided that we build two cruisers to one of our
friends, and, say, three battle-ships to their two.”

Two agitations are proceeding in the great
Sydney freetrade daily press—one for the training
of Australian youths to a sea-faring life, the other
for the establishment in Australia of a gunpowder
factory. Both movements, from a freetrade point
of view, are simply absurd. We can now get
powder from England far more cheaply than we
can make it, and we can import “ Dutch ” sailors,
not to mention “Dagoes,” at less than half the
wages Australians would expect. Let us stick to
Freetrade —and then, if war comes along and we
have to defend our country, we shall be able to
enlist an army of half-starved rouseabouts and
drinky narrow-chested billiard-room and tote-sbop
spielers, instead of a legion of expert engineers
and other clever artificers. Besides, why can’t we
hire Chinese to fight for us ?
Dear Bulletin, —Be the statement that
the Mr. Fitzgerald, who was said to have distin-

of that party. It can be depended upon as

Judge Windeyer complained bitterly the
other day about the manner in which a witness
shuffled his feet around while giving his evidence.
He shuffled his feet all the time, but he shuffled
harder than usual under cross-examination, and
from the agitation of his extremities Mr. Winde-
yer concluded that he wasn’t telling the truth.
Under the Irish system a witness is placed on a
table where his legs are in full view of the court,,
and Mr. Windeyer thinks that this idea might
advantageously be introduced into N.S. Wales.
The question arises whether a nervous witness on
a table, knowing that everybody in the court
(including the judge who tried the Mount Rennie
wretches all round the clock) was looking at his
legs (also his neck), and possibly conscious that
they (his legs) were both crooked and that ms
pants were frayed at the ends, would not be liable
to give way to nervousness in any case. Any
ordinary man can be reduced to an agony of
nervous excitement if he knows that a large crowd
is gazing with horrible intentness at his legs.
Very few people’s legs can bear such close inspec-
tion. After all, Charles Lamb was right, ihe
most dangerous rogue is the man who can look yon
straightest in the face.
Sydney Wool Sales.
M’Burney, Wallis & Co. report.—No change in prices
may be quoted for this week. Buyers still have the same
aversion to all heavy, seedy or burry, or roughly-got-up
clips. Light, free, carefully-prepared lots alone command
anything like the brisk competition which has hitherto’
always marked a Sydney wool-sale. We have the con-
solation of knowing the market here is at least equal to
London. With manufacturers in Europe and England at
present overstocked we cannot anticipate a rise in the
near future, and our only advice to country friends is—
sell in Sydney ; and we are glad to note the plucky man-
ner in which the wool-growers of the colony are already
meeting the market. In a season like this the grower
who hampers his agent with a big reserve is certain to
lose a farthing or a halfpenny per pound in the long run.
The first bid is always the highest, and buyers will seldom
repeat it at a second offering, nor will they hold to it
while agents refer to owners. Sydney, Nov. 16,1894.

The exuberant youth who stood his friends a

A gentleman-spieler, whose social position has
hitherto enabled him to secure a good living out of rich

backed Fortunatus to win £lOOO for one mug, Regina to
win £3OO for another, and Tiraoni to win £4OO for another.
All, as he thought, hopeless stiffs. As they all came off

was taken suddenly ill on Monday. “ Doctor forbids

notes from fellow “books,” and, when the backer turned
up for £lOO (100 to 3, Patron), the “book” handed
over, without comment, the £lOO all in the wrong-’un s
own particular brand of note. The exchange of winks

There has been a little row amongst some of the
“ fringe ” of London racing society. Alf. Savile, the well-
known bookmaker, and Cockburn, a quondam pal of the
late Abington Baird (who was concerned in a row at that
gentleman’s house in Berkeley-square when Chesterfield
Goode fought Charlie Mitchell with a poker), a few weeks
ago drove to a house in Regent’s Park occupied by a
Yankee named Taylor. In a few minutes Savile was flung
out, cut and bleeding, and a policeman, on entering the
house, found Cockburn lying on the floor, cut and slashed
about fearfully. Two cutlasses were found near him
covered with blood. Cockburn was at once taken to the
hospital, and his life was in danger. What the row was
about no one seems to know.

among some rocks and a portion of the mechanism was
broken. It was brought to Cooma for repairs, and Mr.
Thompson, who was carrying it home, by some means or
other received a terrible blow on the head from it. Blood
gushed forth from the wound and Mr. Thompson was
rendered almost insensible, he having to obtain medical
aid. The owner of the gun (which is a most valuable
one) has given instructions to have it destroyed.”

Dear Bulletin, —There has arrived at our
camp a new-chum Englishman, a real type, don’t-
cherknow. From his own statements he is a
remittance-man —middle-aged, and his wife and
Son (!) have taken charge of his business and sent
him to Australia to lose himself for three years,
and if he manages to live over that period he may
go back again. Meantime, he yearns for “ colonial
experience.” The boss told him off the other day
to cut down a 6in. sapling. He armed himself
with the small-sized cross-cut saw and got a mate
to help him to lay low this mighty monarch of the
forest. “Well, my lord,” said the boss, “I’m
glad to see you taking kindly to the cross-cut; it
will be useful to you when you go out as jackeroo
on a back-blocks station. But you must remem-
ber, my lord, that no one is considered an expert
with that tool until he can use a 6-foot cross-cut
single-handed.” “Weally?” said his lordship,
and he paused awhile. Then : “ But tell me,
don’tcherknow. How do you keep the wetched
instwument from —aw wobbling, don’tcher-
know ?” Well, we don’t know. Do you ? —Yours,
Dipso.
Dear Bulletin, —“ Steele Grey ” is right
re the female aborigine. Here are two cases
still in the flesh. Mary, Queen of King
Neddy (deceased) and of Bonshaw, on the
Dumaresq River, first produced half-castes,
one of whom is, or was, the only half-blood
of this island whom I ever knew to commit
suicide. He killed his mate and shot himself
rather than allow the police to arrest him. The
above lady had afterwards Dinah, Ellen, Herbert,
all full blacks, and is still alive at Texas. Another
case, which is not exactly the same, is that of
Maria, half-caste. She has half-
caste; (2) dirty white; (3) full black; (%) half-
caste ; (5) half-Chinaman, his father being a
Chinese cook. These last have been all gathered
into the Wesleyan fold by baptism about a year
ago, and the N.S.W. Govt, supplies them with
rations and clothing, whilst many white people
starve.— Gonyan Tom, Dumaresq River.

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical
School, Glasgow, in an entirely voluntary com-
munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co.,
writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

Mitchell’s Cheques .
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
R was Mitchell, of Bogargo, and his fists were
swift and free,
And he had a type of humor which dealt largely
in surprise
When a station-hand requested him for money
owed —then he
Gave him promptly in full settlement a pair of
fine black eyes.
It was Donnelly, the keeper of the pub. at Iron-
bark,
Would observe, at times, with chuckles grim, a
pair of human wrecks
Coming slowly down the dusty road, and then
would he remark—
“Go and close the bar, Maria! Here are two
of Mitchell's cheques.”
It was Thomson who a billet at Bogargo Station
took,
And as nice a little man he was as you would
wish to know;
It was Mrs. Thomson took a situation there as
cook,
And her fighting-weight it was about two
hundred-weight or so.
It was likewise Mr. Mitchell who, when Thomson
sought his cash,
With despatch did add him quickly to his list of
human wrecks ;
It was also Mrs. Thomson who of Mitchell made
a hash,
And from that day forth the spelling changed
of Mister Mitchell’s checks.

The South African Review takes a front
seat as literary pirate. In one recent issue it

columns—all without acknowledgment.
The Geraldton (N.Q.) editor :
The Salvation Army continue their triumphant course
in Geraldton. Much of the success is due to the engaging
Lieutenant, whose bright eyes, graceful form and excep-
tional musical ability render her so attractive. The Com-
manders who move the Army are discreet in the selection
of their officers, male and female, and in the case of
Geraldton have shown good judgment. We cannot leave
the subject without bearing tribute to the earnestness
and untiring heartiness with which the pretty Lieutenant,
whose name we do not know [what is he giving us I —Ed.
B.], carries out her duties.
She holds the soul of that editor in the hollow of
her hand.
N.S.W. Education Department has re-
turned to the ridiculous vogue of admitting into
public schools babies under five years of age, the
excuse alleged being that, in order to carry out the
arbitrary regulation that there must be a certain
capitation attendance or a school must be closed,
the exclusion of babyhood had resulted in the
closure of many schools. In order to support one
absurd regulation, the department insists upon
adhering to a second absurdity. Why not abolish
the rule that requires an impossible capitation
attendance in sparsely-settled districts? Why
not discriminate between districts ? Because red-
tape is the incurable leprosy of administrative
incapacity.
The halcyon days of the expert shorthand-
writer have gone for ever in Australia. Up to
recently a verbatim reporter charged, and got, a
retaining-fee of two guineas a day, and, in addi-
tion, one shilling for every folio of 72 words re-
ported. Now the Is. a folio has been cut off by
Govt, and the lawyers, who are the chief em-
ployers of shorthand-writers, and the reporter has
to be content with his daily two-guinea fee —the
client paying the typewriter, to whom the record-
ing angel dictates his notes. The other day, when
a shorthand-writer sued a lawyer in a Sydney
court for Is. a folio in addition to this fee, the
lawyer swore that the rate was not a customary
one, and, further, that a Herald reporter had
been working for him at two guineas a day and
only 3d. a folio additional. The fall of the rates
is not due to the competition of women or to the
plentifulness of expert male shorthand-writers.
There are said to be some clever lady phono-
graphers in America, but women have so far been
utter failures as verbatim reporters in Australia,
though they are on the average better typists than
ffien in oases where they have not to work at con-
tinuous high pressure. Nor are there many first-
olass male shorthand-writers available, for not
more than one man in 500 who fags at shorthand
makes an absolutely dependable verbatim writer.
Reliable shorthanders are as scarce as prima-
uonnas—and always will be.

“The dancing-rooms are possibly doing
more barm than the churches.” — Sydney Sunday
Times.
At 75 years old the good, sturdy President
Pretorius, of the Transvaal, thought of marriage
(says the South African Empire), and wrote to a
buxom widow at some distance notifying that he
would call on her with a licence. So one day he
spanned-in his mules, paid £7 10s, for his licence,
and leisurely trekked to the widow’s homestead.
He had lingered too long. “ Jij es toe laat,” said
the widow, “I was married last week.” Pretorius
shook hands, lit his pipe, and returned to
Pretoria. “Mr, Bok,” he said, “ I want you to
scratch out that name and put in Widow .
I think she’ll have me.” “I can’t do that, Mr.
Pretorius, the licence is annulled; but go down
to Oom Paul and see what he can do.” The ex-
President gravely went down to his successor and
stated his case: “No, no; I can’t do as you
wish ; but here is £7 10s. for a new licence.” Off,
then, went the old man to the registrar, secured
his new licence and the widow as well.
HE MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED ANY DAY.
There was once a man, who, on account of his
religious convictions, was arrested by a despotic
government and thrown into prison. Looking at
the strong stone walls that shut him in, he natur-
ally concluded that he must spend the rest of his
days in this lonely and dismal place. Yet wretched
as the prospect was, there was some comfort in the
thought that he was a victim of oppression, and
not undergoing punishment as a violator of any
good and righteous law. All the same, he would
have been glad to get out, as he had a right to do
if he could.
Nevertheless, there he stayed and languished for
sixteen years. At nearly the end of that period
it occurred to him one day to climb up on a
projecting stone in the wall and take a peep
through the window above his head. He did so,
and found the iron bars removable and the sash
not fastened. An idea struck him, of course.
Why not escape ? He opened the window, jumped
six feet to the ground, and left that district
immediately. He might have done so at any time
during his protracted occupancy of the place, if he
had only been blessed with a more inquiring mind
and not taken so much for granted.
Now here comes an incident both like and unlike
that of the martyr ; like it because there was loss
of free action, unlike it because the sufferer was
not imprisoned as he was.
The story is in the form of a letter, one of those
letters we all prefer to get—short and made up of
short words. The writer, a lady, says : “For the
last sixteen years I have been greatly afflicted
with bilious complaints and weakness. I was
always tired, weak, and low-spirited. I had no
appetite, and when food was placed before me
I could not couch it. For days I could scarcely
eat anything. At times I was troubled with
sickness and heaving at the stomach, spitting up a
thick phlegm. I had a troublesome cough, with
pain at my chest and difficulty of breathing. I
got very weak and could scarcely drag myself in
and out of the shop. In December, 1891, I began
to take a medicine I had heard well spoken of by
many of my customers, called Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup. After I had taken only a few
doses I felt relief, and I had not used the medicine
for a fortnight when I felt better than I had done
for years. Thus encouraged, I kept on with it
until I was restored to good health. My son,
Arthur, had suffered off and on for a year from
pain and heaviness after meals, with a sinking
feeling at the pit of the stomach. He was induced
to try Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and the
result was the same as in my own case. I know
several persons in this district who have been
cured by the Syrup after all other means had
failed. You are at liberty to publish my letter if
you think it might be of benefit to others afflicted
as I was. —Yours truly, (signed) (Mrs.) M. Ward,
174, Ilkeston-road, Radford, Nottingham, April
Ist, 1892.”
We congratulate Mrs. Ward upon her deliver-
ance from a distressing and dangerous disease.
What a pity she did not sooner learn how easily
and certainly she could be cured. Sixteen years
is too large a slice out of one’s life to be spent in
bodily and mental misery. Very few of us can
have wealth in any case, but health should be a
blessing common and universal as sunshine. And
it might be if everybody knew how to preserve it
when they possess it, or to regain it when lost.
This lady’s disease was of the digestive organs—
indigestion and dyspepsia—the most afflictive and
perilous of all, because it involves every function of
the body, scattering its poison at every point
through the medium of the blood. Nearly all
ailments are but the differently-named results and
symptoms of this prolific parent of evil. That the
remedy she mentions should have cured her will
not surprise those who know its well-founded
reputation. Many worse cases constantly yield
to it.
Our friend the martyr abode in his cell a weary
time because he was ignorant of the simple way
out. If the reader of these lines is a captive to
disease he has no excuse for remaining so. In her
short and honest letter our correspondent points
to the open door.
It is remarked that nuns are nearly all
smallish women.
“The New Woman — A darn to the old
Blue Stocking. ” — Gentlewoman.
In Chicago (U.S. A.) recently a young man
was fined 25d01. and costs for “laughing and hoot-
ing ” at a lady in pants. A lady in pants is a
woman and a brother and must be treated as
such.
Brisbane Worker thus Australianises an
American story:—
A cute Yankee promoter, who thought he understood
the customs of the country, called on the President of a
South American Republic to get a certain concession
signed, “If your Excellency will sign this,” said the
Yankee, “ I am authorised to hand you 50,000 dollars,
and no one will know anything about it.” “Make it
100,000 dollars," replied the President, “and I don’t care
a damn who knows about it.” The deal was done.
That tale appeared originally in an American
magazine, and the President’s answer was, “Make
it 100,000 dollars and tell everybody.” The curse
is simply inserted to make it Australian. No
story is ever properly told in the Australian lan-
guage unless the principal character curses, and
no story has a democratic flavour unless he curses
considerably. Also no story sounds true to the
Australian reader without curses in it. Aus-
tralian is the curse-language of the earth.
The treatment of Piles by the new Cannalin
remedies is necessitating the dispatch of large
quantities to all parts of the colonies. Applica-
tions must be made direct to the depot at 257

of Mr. Sharp’s popular work on “ Piles ” can be

The S.M. Herald sneers that the Maori-
land House of Representatives, which it depicts
as “ the Parliament which, above all others, is
supposed to conserve the rights of the poor and
the wronged in the competition of life,” has no
sympathy with horses, because a suggestion about
introducing a Bill to regulate the hours of labor of
“ horses and other animals of burthen ” was re-
ceived with “ loud laughter ” and “ treated as a
joke.” The S.M. Herald thinks this a strange
attitude on the part of a parliament whose statute-
book is supposed to breathe “ the sentiment of
humanity.” It is not strange that the S.M.
Herald, which has nothing but Fat Man sym-
pathy for humanity, can vent big mouthfuls of
pity for horses. The average Tory paper always
did regard the horse as a nobler and more valuable
animal than man. The Fatman bestows care and
attention upon his horse, but calls for the blood,
bones and marrow of the working-man, because
the latter’s name is always Legion.

The Chicago Starch Mills, at Lane Cove
river, Sydney, which were formallystarted the other
day by ex-Premier Dibbs, are another evidence
of the benefits derived from even a small measure
of Protection. Two years ago a duty of Id. per
lb. was levied on imported starch, cornflour,
arrowroot, maizena, and similar articles. In the
case of cornflour a local industry immediately
sprang up, furnishing employment to a consider-
able number of people and distributing a good
amount of money in wages, and, according to the
usual result in such oases, the price of the article
promptly dropped—in this case to about half the
figure at which it stood in the days when the im-
porter had a monopoly of the market. The price
of starch, on the other hand, went up in the
absence of local competition, but with the opening
of the new industry it must also fall according to
the same inevitable law. The owners of the
Chicago Mills, Messrs. Clifford, Love & Co., of
Clarence-street, Sydney, are manufacturers of oat-
meal, arrowroot, cornflour, and many other
articles; coffee-roasters, tea-blenders, &c. They
employ a large number of hands, and distribute
over .£lO,OOO a year in wages, a total which will
be considerably added to if their latest industry
is not blighted in its inception by the importers’
Government, now in power in N.S. Wales, acting
in the interests of the firms which dump down
European produce on Circular Quay.

under his leg-irons. I told him no such things were
issued from the stores, each man in chains provided his
own. He then said he would not go out unless he got
leathers. After the gang had mustered and ready to
march out, Assist.-Suptd. Coles brought the prisoner to
me and told me he had refused to go out to work. I did
then give the prisoner an order to join his party and go
out to work. He told me that he would not. I then
ordered him to confinement. Verdict—guilty. Sentence
—to receive a corporal punishment of thirty-six (36)
lashes.—Signed, L. P. Jones, Y.M., 19th Deo., 1845.
Thomas White, No. 2675, Ship Runnymede, 7 years
transportation in chains, charged on complaint of Mr.
James M‘Namara, H.M. medical officer, with misconduct
in feigning sickness and refusing to go to work and also
with insolence to him on the sth day of August. Evidence
—Dr. James M'Namara being sworn saith on yesterday
morning the prisoner was brought before me. I asked
him what was the matter with him ? He said he had a
pain in his side. I examined him, and was of opinion
that there was nothing the matter with him to prevent
him going to work, upon which I desired him to go. He
then in a very insolent tone and manner called me a
, and said I did not know when a man was sick, and
repeated his insolent language afterwards. Sentence—To
receive a corporal punishment of 36 lashes.—Signed, L.
P. Jones, Y.M. 8 August, 1845.

“Chinese Mary . ”
A STORY OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
; i.
It was on a soft spring evening in Mel-
bourne, sofne two years ago. The moon was full,
and her flooding lustre, in which all things were
drowned, made the city seem as if it were built on
the bed of a wonderful translucent sea. Ear above
the stars shone like lights of ships sailing slowly
on the surface of that sea, and the moon herself
looked like the sun, seen through infinite depths,
of a strange and glorious upper world. The air
was full of subtle scents and whispers wafted
from trees dreaming of summer, and growing as
they dreamt.
• • •
John Avery, storekeeper, of Yandip, was
dimly conscious of these things as he sauntered
down Collins-street. They made him feel in a
vague way that a good Christian, in comfortable
circumstances, might, so long as Providence and
the banks were on his side, live pleasantly enough
even in this sinful world. They even gave him a
faint ghostly suspicion (not then entertained for
the first time) that, possibly, he was better fitted
by nature to be happy amidst such surroundings
than in an awful heaven wherein he should sing
hosannahs, without resting, from everlasting to
everlasting. This old earth of ours is, after all,
a homely and not unjoyful place when one has a
good digestion and a little money coming in regu-
larly.
Yet, although these thoughts passed through his
mind, John Avery was a sincerely religious man
in his own placid, easy-going way, and a better
friend to unlucky, unregenerate persons than
many a loud-protesting Brother, with mouth per-
petually open to proclaim the good tidings of sal-
vation for sinners in the life to come, and purse
chronically lockjawed against appeals for help
made by hungry sinners in this present life.
* « *
Ha had come to Melbourne to spend his
honeymoon, which was, perhaps, another reason
why he felt more than usually in harmony with
the facts of existence. The evening in question
was the last of his visit and the first he had spent
in his own company. He was, of course, fond of
his bride, but the fondness could hardly be ex-
pected to rise to the level of delirium, seeing that
he had married on the quiet grounds that she
would make a good housekeeper and helpmate in
his business. He had had his romance which had
ended in disappointment, and which might have
left lasting bitterness behind, if it had not been
for the natural sweetness of his blood. And,
strangely enough (or possibly not so strangely), it
was of the other figure in this dead and buried
romance that he was thinking as he leisurely
turned into Swanston-street and oame face to face
with a tall dark young woman with painted
cheeks and the unmistakeable air peculiar to mem-
bers of the unfortunate Profession. Changed as
she was, he knew her in a flash, and, in a voice
husky with emotion, exclaimed, “Good God!
Mary, is this you ?”
The young woman looked vacantly at him for a
moment, .and then, with a hard little laugh, re-
plied, “ Yes, John Avery. This is your old sweet-
heart, Mary Allen. Would you like to marry me
nowV’
“ Don’t, for Heaven’s sake, talk like that,
Mary,” he said ; “walk down this way. I want
to speak to you. Do come for the sake of old
times.”
She gazed at him quietly, almost curiously, and
laughed again. But there was no hardness in her
laugh this time. “ The same good old, soft-
hearted John,” she remarked. “Well, 1 will go
with you, but you must promise not to preach to
me. I’m past preaching to.”
» * •
They walked in the direction of Princes
Bridge.
“Aren’t you afraid of Lizzy, John?” she en-
quired suddenly.
“Of Lizzy? No. Why?”
“ Well, you ought to be—and, if she is the same
Lizzy Saunders I used to know, I rather think
you would be if she heard of your parading
through the streets with me, and your honeymoon
not half over yet.”
It was John Avery’s turn to laugh, but there
was a faint ring of uneasiness in his laughter
which did not escape the notice of his companion.
“Oh, yes,” she said, “I heard all about your
marriage. Lizzy’s done a good thing for herself,
and, I daresay, you might have done worse. You
might, for instance, have married me.”
“ Ah, if you’d only listened to me, Mary,” he
murmured, “how different it would have all
been !”
“ Perhaps—but 1 was too ambitious, you know.
God !” she exclaimed, bitterly, “ I brought my
ambition to a nice market.”
They had come to the bridge, and were gazing
over the parapet at the silent river flowing beneath
them.
“Many a night,” she said, “I’ve come here
meaning to make an end of it all down below
there. I’m sure I don’t know why I didn’t. I
suppose I was too great a coward.”
“Poor girl! Poor Mary!” said John Avery,
with a great pity in his voice. And then, in a
hesitating way, avoiding mention of names, he
asked; “Where is he all this time?” “ Hel
The hound !” cried the girl in a tone of passionate
scorn—“ He left me in the midst of my trouble-
left me without a penny and told me I might die
and be damned for all he cared. It died, poor
thing,” she continued gloomily,” but I didn’t. I
only went to the devil.”
" But why,” enquired her old lover, with
grotesque simplicity, “why didn’t you write to
me? You might havo known that I would have
been only too glad to help you.”
“ Ah, yes—l knew, but can’t you think, _ can t
you see, that you would be the last person in the
world I would be likely to write to ?” She looked
gravely at him for a moment or two, and then a
tender, half-humorous smile came to her lips and
made her face beautiful in spite of its coating of
paint. “No, of course, you can’t, poor old John,”
she added, “ and that’s what makes you so good.”
They talked a good deal more after this, and at
last John Avery brought out what was on his
mind. He told Mary Allen that her father and
mother (as far as the latter was concerned John
tampered with the truth slightly) were sorely
anxious that she should come home again. Her
brother Jim had gone to Western Australia, and
her sister Letitia had married Morgan, the local
draper, so that the old couple were living by them-
selves and felt lonely. Would she come? _ She
made no answer for several minutes. Then, giving
her hand to her companion, she said : “ Yes,
John, I will. The life lam leading now is killing
me, body and souL I’ll go home.”
“ Thank God for that,” said John Avery.
11.
Mary Allen had been a week at home
when the Rev. Bolger, the Church of England
minister under whom her parents sat, as the
phrase goes, came, with the best intentions in the
world, to see her and to preach to her a private
sermon. He was a truly good and pious man, but
his eyes were as wide apart as the eyes of a rabbit;
and tact and good taste were to him terms
describing sinful concessions to worldliness. He
had also—intertwisted strangely with a fierce
ascetic purity—a sort of shy pruriency which filled
in with unuttered imaginative questions the
pauses between his spoken moral remarks. He
had only been a year in the parish of Yandip, and
knew nothing of Mary Allen personally. Her
story he had heard, through the medium of his
wife, and, as a matter of course, it lost nothing in
the telling. It takes a good religious woman to
make sharp the angles in the history of another
woman who has gone wrong.
Mary listened quietly to his discourse, but there
was a sombre fire in her eyes which would have
warned a man of this world against saying much
more. The Rev. Bolger, however, was a man of
the next world, and talked accordingly.
“ It must have been a dreadful life for you,” he
said, stroking his weak fair beard with a white
anaemic hand.
“ It was not good,” replied Mary, drily.
“Oh, no—of course not —but now you must
reform and change all that,” he observed, in a
bland, soothing tone.
“ And what do you call what I’m doing now
but reforming, Mr. Bolger?” she enquired, making
a straight line of her lips.
“True enough,” said Mr. Bolger, “but the
question is, my child, are you reforming in a
proper spirit ? That is the vital point. Will you
come to the morning service next Sunday?”
Mary promised that she would do so, and the
clergyman took his leave. She watched him as
he walked down through the front garden, his
long, black shadow casting a gloom upon the
flowers as he passed. And then she resumed her
household duties with a sufficiently heavy heart.
* « •
Her father when she had come back had
taken her in his arms and kissed her. She was
his favorite child, the little one whom he had
nursed on his knees, and to whom he used to go
for comfort when her mother’s tongue was more
than usually sharp. A somewhat weak Rip Van
Winkle kind of man was old Joe Allen, with a
heart bigger than his brain. Her mother was of
a totally different type, a stern, austere woman
whose God was Respectability. She had mani-
fested little surprise, and betrayed no signs of
emotion, when she saw her daughter again. But
justice to her she meant to do, and justice she
would do. And she began doing it by making
her the household drudge, after dismissing the
female servant who cooked for the men employed
on the farm and did all the rough work of the
house. Mary took this as part of her penance
and said nothing. She had one sustaining comfort
in the stolen interviews (they could hardly be
described otherwise) which she had with her
father. Joe Allen, it need scarcely be said, was
not master of his own house.
Mary kept her promise made to the Rev,
Bolger, and went to church on the following Sun-
day. That thoughtful and conscientious clergy-
man preached, for her benefit apparently, a
sermon on the text, “He that is without sin among
you let him first cast a stone at her.”
It was an earnest, impressive, foolish discourse,
full of terrible denunciations alternated with
absurd pathos —the talk, in fact, of a man who
knows nothing of his subject, yet makes himself
believe that he knows all about it, through sheer
power of lungs, and a sense of responsibility to
his audience. And during it all, Mary Allen felt
the eyes of the congregation burning upon her.
But she had more to undergo. When she went
out of the church at the end of the service nobody
appeared to know her. All her old companions
and school-girl friends passed her without recogni-
tion. Honest John Avery, however, leaving his
wife, who went on her way with her virtuous nose
in the air, came up to her as she walked down the
dusty, red road, and said in a husky undertone
“Mary! Mary! Don’t mind him (meaning the
preacher), “he’s a damned fool, and God forgive
me for saying so.”
The girl looked at Avery with eyes full of
wrathful misery.
“ Hadn’t you better go back and ask your
friends why they don’t start to throw stones at
me?” she enquired, bitterly.
That was the last time Mary Allen ever
darkened the doors of a church.
When John Avery rejoined his wife, that
Christian lady remarked, in the tone of sweet
virulence which your very pious woman can some-
times use with such scathing effect, “ So you’re
going to take up with your old sweetheart again,
eh ? I congratulate you on your taste, Mr. Avery.
She has such a nice character—quite virtuous and
respectable. You ought to bring her home with
you while you are about it. You can easily send
me back to my mother, you know,”
All that Avery said in reply was, “ Thank
I’m not a woman—especially a good woman.”
• • *
The measure of loathing with which her
life in Melbourne had inspired Mary Allen was
shown by the unflinching, uncomplaining way in
which she worked out her atonement, which meant
nothing less than a daily martyrdom. Her father
was kind enough to her, in his feeble, furtive
fashion, but her mother gave no sign of relenting
from the stern attitude she had taken up with
regard to her on the first day of her return. Mrs.
Allen was no believer in the virtue of killing the
fatted calf to celebrate the home-coming of
prodigals of either sex. “ A certain fearful look-
ing forward to of judgment and of fiery in-
dignation,” was a text ever uppermost in the
mind of this female Torquemada But though
above the weakness of Mercy, she looked
upon herself as a strictly just woman. And
so Mary was made to feel herself an alien,
living on sufferance, in her own home. When
visitors came to the house —many of the female
portion of them had no other purpose in coming
than to catch a glimpse of her (much in the spirit
in which they would go to see a woman with two
heads, or other monstrosity) in order to be able to
talk about her afterwards—the conversation was
brought to a dead stop if she happened to enter
the room in which they were sitting. This she
never did if she could help it, but kept to herself
in the kitchen on these occasions. Such of the
men-folk as were not absolute brutes behaved
better, and showed a disposition to sympathise
with her in a rough but respectful way, when
their wives were not about. But the members of
her own sex knew how to make up lot this (as
they regarded it) misplaced consideration. If she
went into the township to buy anything in a store,

and there chanced to be any women present at the
time, they made way for her silently, casting sig-
nificant glances at her as they did so. Even the
children were taught to look upon her as a crea-
ture of a lower grade, not fit to be spoken to. The
effects of this lesson were, one day, brought home
in a bitter fashion to the heart of the unhappy
girl. She was in a grocer’s shop making some
purchases, and, seeing a little fellow whom she
had known as a baby standing by the counter, she
patted him on the head and offered him a packet
of lollies. The child looked wistfully at the
packet, but edged away from her, shaking his
head. 44 Mother says you’re a bad woman ’n
I mustn’t speak to you,” he said. This
was nearly the last straw. If they had
only allowed her to make friends of the children—
well, in that case, this story would probably have
never been told. But they thought, so severe was
their virtue, that any approach to familiarity with
ier would contaminate their little ones.
• ’ « •
Her own sister, Letitia, the wife of the
leading draper, who was also a local preacher
gifted with much unction and a powerful exhorter
in his manner, after a frigid acknowledgment of
their relationship, gave her to understand that it
would be better for her not to call at the Drapery
Emporium. 44 We have to consider our cus-
tomers,” said the careful Letitia. Her husband
offered to go to the house and wrestle prayerfully
with the Lord for the benefit of the soul of his
erring sister-in-law, but his erring sister-in-law
would have none of his wrestling. She even so
far forgot herself (some sinners in the place said
it was not without good reason) as to call this
vessel of grace a 44 rancid hypocrite.” Which
brought to a sudden end the previous cold charity
of Letitia Morgan.
• • «
Worse things remain to be told. Yandip
contained the usual proportion of moral Calibans,
with heads hugely developed at the rear, whose
only creed was a profound disbelief in the virtue
of woman and the decency of man. They leered
lasciviously at Mary whenever they met her, and
as soon as they saw that she meant to ignore their
advances, made remarks upon her after the
manner of their kind—a manner which is, un-
fortunately, too familiarly horrible in even the
smallest country town to need description, A
chivalrous local shanty-keeper came to her rescue
on one of these occasions and offered to protect
her from such insults in future—on conditions
which may be guessed, and which she scornfully
rejected, making, thereby, another enemy in the
place.
• • •
The parson’s wife, who considered that
her official position carried with it an odour of
sanctity strong enough to act as a disinfectant
against any conceivable moral contagion, called
upon Mary, and, after preaching a cold little
sermon, in the style of those delivered by her
husband, said that she had heard that Mary was
a good dressmaker. Mary replied with sufficient
meekness that she had that reputation, and her
mother, who was present at the interview,
enlarged upon the subject. The upshot of which
was that the parson’s wife said that she could
obtain some work tor Mary, in the way of making
dresses, from ladies in the neighbourhood, but,
of course, the strictest secrecy would have to be
observed in the unhappy circumstances of the
case. 44 Of course, m’a’am, and very good you are
I’m sure, and very thankful she ought to be for
your kindness,” said Mrs. Allen, speaking on
behalf of her daughter.
The dresses were made and delivered at the
parsonage, according to arrangement. Theunder-
standing was that payment for the work should
also be made in the same conspiratorial fashion,
“What are your charges?” enquired the parson’s
wife.
Mary mentioned them, and the lady threw up
her hands as if astounded.
“Why, young woman,” she said, “you are
charging as much as any dressmaker in the town-
ship.”
“But I am a dressmaker, ma’am,” responded
Mary, “you would hardly have given me the
dresses to make if I hadn’t been.”
“You are far too bold, young woman,” ex-
claimed the parson’s wife with a curling lip, “ and
I regret to observe that you are also ungrateful,
The ladies from whom I obtained this work for
you expected, as I certainly did myself, that, con-
sidering”—with emphasis—“ the peculiar position
you hold, and seeing that the work was given to you
a ? an encouragement, you would not look to get-

-*-he en “ . ® ma tter was that Mary accepted
the remuneration offered her. But that was the
last of her dressmaking for the Ladies of Yandip.
• * *
With the money she received—it was not
more than half the amount that would have been
offered to the pooreBt dresa maker in the place-
M ary Allen bought some cheap, quiet material
and made a gown for heraelf) not before it was
badly wanted. Her mother watched her, chafing
silently. “Mary,” she said at last, being able to
contain herself no longer, “I thought that when
you gave up your sinful way of living, and came
home, you were done with fineries for the rest of
your life.”
“But, mother,” answered the girl, holding up a
piece of drab-colored print, “you surely don’t call
thi* finery?”
. “ Go your own way, girl,” exclaimed the
implacable woman, “ I wash my hands of you.”
“ God knows,” cried her daughter passionately,
“ I have tried hard enough to go your way,
mother, and instead of helping me, and being
kind to me, you have treated me worse than if I
had been a homeless dog. Your friends have done
the same. If this is what you call Christian
charity, I want no more of it.”
It was, no doubt, a sign of shocking innate
depravity, but the girl had actually grown tired
°l being treated as a social leper—a pariah outside
*b? Pam of human interests, and human fellow-
S | ll P - Sue should have continued drinking from
*'“ e CU P °| bitterness prepared for her as a punish-
menL and, perhaps, might have done so if she had
not found reasons for believing that the cup was
without bottom.
# * *
It was a cold wintry day when Mary Allen
looked for the last time at the home of her child-
hood; the home in which, since her repentant
return, she had passed six long months of martyr-
dom—in vain.
Her father was standing at the gate of the front
garden. She put her arms around his neck and
kissed him gently, sadly, as a dying mother might
kiss a child she was leaving behind. “Good-bye,
daddy,” she said, “poor daddy! You did what
you could, but everybody was against me.”
“ But where are you going, and what are you
going to do, my dear ? ” enquired the helpless old
man.
44 Never mind. Til get on all right. Maybe
I’m going into a convent to be a nun. Maybe
not. It doesn’t matter, anyhow.” And she
walked away with a light and reckless laugh.
But she turned swiftly back again and embraced
the old man with a fierce fondness that belied her
laughter. And he knew in his heart that the
parting kiss she gave him was the kiss of despair.
When he went indoors he found his wife, her
mouth set firmly, quietly performing her house-
hold duties.
44 So you’ve driven her away at last,” he said,
looking reproachfully at the woman to whom he
had never dared to speak out like a man.
She turned a grey face towards him and replied:
44 Joseph Allen, I have the salvation of my own
soul to look after. Mary has made her own bed ;
let her lie on it.”
And from that day forth, until the day of her
death, the name of her erring daughter never
passed the lips of this rigid Christian mother.
111.
Mary Allen had been lost to Yandip for about a
year when John Avery paid another visit to Mel-
bourne. Business had prospered with him during
this year, and he bad many things to do in the
city. So that it is not particularly strange that
he didn’t find time to think about his old sweet-
heart until the last evening of his stay. This
evening, however, he determined to devote to
making enquiries as to what had become of her.
Luck favoured him. He met, almost at the door
of his hotel, a plain-clothes policeman who had
been stationed at Yandip some years previously,
and who, as a matter of course, knew everybody
living in, or around, that Arcadian village. Roper
was the man’s name, and, in answer to John
Avery’s enquiries about Mary Allen, he replied
with some traces of feeling in his voice— 44 Ah, Mr.
Avery, it’s a sad story. She went to the devil,
at first, as we all know, but she’s gone to the dogs
since. Some 18 months ago, or thereabouts, I
remember she used to belong to the highest set of
women of that kind—you know the kind I mean.
But one day, about that time, she disappeared
suddenly and wasn’t seen in the city again for six
months. She would never tell where she had been
during these six months, but the women who knew
her used to say that she must have been in a
lunatic asylum. If that was so she should never
have been let out of it. She took to drink like a
demon, and not only to drink but to opium, and
sank lower and lower till she could hardly find
even a woman of her own class who would have
anything to say to her. If you wish it, I think I
can show you where she is to be found—but I
warn you that the sight will not be a pleasant
one.”
John Avery said he would take the risk, and
they went on their way.
• « «
Roper led the honest, God-fearing country
storekeeper through reeking lanes and alleys, run-
ning off Little Bourke-street, the like of which he
had never seen before. The policeman turned up
one of the noisomest of these —a dismal alley, the
very stones of which seemed to proclaim it the
abode of crime and misery. Half-way up it there
was a vacant space, upon which was collected a
crowd of the typical denizens of the locality,
cheering and hooting like maniacs. Roper elbowed
his way through them, closely, though reluctantly
followed by John Avery. And then the latter
saw a sight which made him sick with disgust. I n
the middle of a ring formed by the crowd, two
women, with sleeves upturned to the shoulder
bodices torn to ribbons, and dishevelled hair, were
fighting like wild cats. Their faces were streaming
with blood, and they were panting like hounds at
the finish of a chase. The end of the fight was
evidently near at hand. The taller of the two
women, who seemed mad with drink and fury
struck out suddenly and the other woman dropped
like a stone, and lay w here she fell,
44 Good old Chinese Mary !” yelled the crowd.
At this moment a blear-eyed, wizened-faced
Chinaman stepped forward, and, taking the con-
queror in this gruesome combat by the arm, led
her away, staggering and whooping as she went.
44 Have you seen enough ?” said the policeman
to his companion.
John Avery’s face was of the color of ashes.
44 Thank God her poor old father died before he
could hear of this!” he exclaimed, hoarsely.
Eor the frightful creature whom he had seen
led away by the hideous Chinaman was the wreck
of his old sweetheart, Mary Allen.
