Dear Bulletin, —Perth has moved ahead
a bit since the year of the Kimberley rush. I
remember, in ’B6, I wanted a glass for my watch,
and called on a watchmaker and jeweller in the
main street, only to find his door closed, and an
envelope gummed on it with the words idn the
jury till 4 o’clock.” I called next day, and then
the legend ran, ‘ 6 Still on that blessed jury.

S.M. Herald says ; “ If the retrenchment
party succeeds in cutting down large salaries, the
present holders will retire and their places will be
filled by medium men.” This is based on the
assumption that none of the present holders are
medium men, and that they can all hud good
billets to retire to at any moment. Yet when
Berry sacked dozens of the high-salaried Victorian
civil servants, what a number of them retired to
beggary, or suicide, or the lunatic asylum. i here
was no demand for them anywhere. They were
poor, dull fossils who were utterly useless outside
the service and nearly useless in it. At least na
the civil service, if it retired in dudgeon because
its salary was reduced, would straightway start
on that downward road whose end is a disused
tank on a waste allotment.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their

"Every Spring, for years, I have had
Intolerable headaches, and total loss of en-
ergy, so that the season which should be
welcomed by me was a dread, for, as the
warm, pleasant days arrived, they brought
to me lassitude and pain. My druggist had
known me from childhood, and advised me
to take, early in the Spring, Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla. I commenced using it and have not
had, since then, the first symptom of head-
ache; my appetite is splendid, and I per-
form my daily duties with a cheerfulness
and energy that surprises myself.” *

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
mm
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
GUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.
Skins on Fire
with Itching and Burning Eczemas, and other itching,

by a single application, and speedily, permanently, and

Dear Bulletin,-—” Binghi ” is remarkably
correct about bush orgies and fighting; yet, to a
certain extent, he requires correction. Men do not
fight in Australia so much as “at ’ome.” But
they talk fight. By “ they ” I mean the mobsman
or gregarious bushman ; the yearly epidemic, not
the_ endemic rustic; the shearing, harvesting,
racing or cane-cutting lot. I also allude to the
bar-and-verandah-form mob of town loafers, and
they are the pick of the trash. I know a bush-
man, however, one “Slippery,” who will talk fight
as soon as he has one drink in him. But he will
fight. On his behalf I challenged all the fighting
youths to stand up for four rounds in a hall. Where
were they ? The verandah family, who had just
stated that anyone of them could “ do ” Slippery,
heard the challenge and left. The barber’s lot
chuckled buc did not come forward. The long-
beerians, rabbiters, spielers, fat-heads, slanter-
bookies, &0., were all there and as certainly “not
there.” And yet Slippery had nothing to go on.
He can’t fight; he always gets beaten ; he has no
science, no constitution, and won’t train as long as
“ loner-’uns ” are plentiful. But he will fight, and
likes it, and they feared him. The Australian
won’t fight his equal unless in liquor. I have
asked dozens just to stand up and see if my hand
was in. The other side was all blasphemy, brag,
and hurried exit. Again, when I have been chal-
lenged by a man whom I knew (and who knew
himself) to be my superior with fists, I never
could get a trial on with sticks, bricks in a sack,
iron rods, or anything that would break a bone.
One excuse was that ‘‘perhaps I had practised.”
No, we don’t fight in Australia —unless we know
our marks.— Scotty the Wrinkler.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 5, 1895.
The House of Forty-Eight Rich
Landlords.
The Victorian Land and Income-Tax Bill
has got through the Assembly and reached
the Upper .House, and there, as anticipated
by everybody who knew the record of that
fatuous Chamber, the progressive policy of the
Turner Government has met with its first
serious check. The immediate action of the
Council, on receiving the obnoxious bill, was
to postpone its consideration for several
weeks, and all the efforts of the Govern-
ment’s representative, Mr. Cuthbbrt, to in-
duce it to go on with business were met with
blank refusal. The Council was in a hostile
and aggressive mood, and was anxious-to
show it as definitely as possible. And when
that august but doddering body does proceed
to seriously consider the measure, it is tole-
rably certain that it will either be altogether
rejected, or will be amended until it loses
all semblance of its original shape and pur-
pose. That much was tolerably certain
many weeks ago, but Sargood’s resignation,
and his open declaration of war against the
Government, and the Council’s aggressive
attitude of a few days ago, all tend to make
it still more certain. Unless under the
influence of absolute terrorism, the Victorian
Upper House will never give its assent to
Premier Turner’s scheme for taxing the big
landowners and capitalists of the province in
order to fill the yawning void in the revenue.
And, when it has rejected the Bill, Victoria
will once more be brought up short against
the problem which it has already met so
often, and has so often failed to solve, and
which it yet must solve sooner or later.
* * *
The Victorian Council is like hardly any-
thing else of its kind on this earth. It is
more distinctly Tory than the British House
of or the Legislative Councils of the
six other provinces of Australasia, and it is
more elaborately secured against popular
pressure than any of them. It was con-
structed with a strange and fiendish in-
genuity which makes it almost impossible for
any man with even a semblance of liberal
sentiment to get into it, and which makes
it an epitome of the aggregate greed,
selfishness, bigotry and hopeless Toryism
of the province. It enjoys the distinction of
being the very worst thing of its species in
Australasia, and pretty nearly the worst
thing of its species in this world. It can’t be
dissolved, neither can it dissolve itself ; the
members are elected for six years, and as
they retire in rotation, the country never
even enjoys the doubtful advantage of getting
a new Council; there are always two-thirds of
the old horror left. It is based mainly on a
property suffrage, the qualification being the
ownership of a freehold valued for rating
purposes at £lO per annum, or of a lease-
hold valued at £25 per annum. The only
persons, not being landholders, who can
vote at Council elections are doctors of
medicine, certificated schoolmasters, matricu-
lated students of Melbourne University,
military and naval officers, parsons, bar-
risters, solicitors, and graduates of British
Universities. Considering the incurable
Toryism of at least seven out of these
nine classes, the Council's constituency
may be set down, for all practical purposes,
as one that embodies all the Conservative
elements of the community and leaves out
all others.
# * *
This, however, is by no means all. There
is a qualification for members of the Council
as well as for electors, and no one can enter
that chamber of solemn decay unless he owns
freehold property to the rateable value of at
least £lOO per annum. Land is the one and
only test of fitness to direct the destinies of
Victoria in the Upper House. A man may
have learning, genius, high character, un-
bounded popularity, and may possess
£10,000,000 in cash or Government stock,
but unless he owns the requisite amount of
land he is, so far as the Victorian Legislative
Council is concerned, but sounding brass and
a tinkling cymbal. The Council is a body
of large landholders elected by landholders
and lawyers. It is the outward and visible
sign of mould, and decayed vegetation, and
grass, and large fat worms, and rotted flesh
and other fertilisers, and it is earthy like
the constituency which it represents.
Therefore on every point where the interests
of the large landholder can possibly come
into collision with those of the people who
do not own land, or where the interests of
the man with a. large income are diametri-
cally opposed to those of the man with a
small one, the Council blocks the way. It
is against land-taxes, income-taxes, and
absentee-taxes ; it is against the withdrawal
of the subsidies paid to local bodies, against
an efficient Betterment Act which would
compel landholders whose property values
were increased by public works to pay part
of the cost thereof, against land nationalisa-
tion, against a State Bank, against one-man-
one-vote, against any attempt to restrict the
growth of big estates, against any effective
scheme of banking-reform—in short, against
nearly everything which the country most
requires. It came into existence at a time
when almost every iniquity which the Fat
Man could desire was embodied in the
statute-book, therefore it did not require to
legislate to secure its ends ; it had merely to
spread itself across the track and prevent
legislation. The role it had to fill was
that of a dead and putrefying mass lying
on the national chest, and all through its
career it has filled this role to perfection.
• • *
In Maoriland, Queensland and New
South Wales the Upper House is a nominee
body. Therefore, a Democratic Ministry
can swamp it with liberal nominees in order
to bring it in line with the popular will,
and, if the people demand its abolition,
can fill it with representatives who are
pledged to pass a bill wiping themselves out
of legislative existence. In South Australia
and Tasmania the Council is elected on a
property qualification, but there is no pro-
perty qualification for Councillors them-
selves, consequently it often happens that
the mass of small property holders support
the Democratic cause as against the Tory
instincts of the big landlords, and return
men of liberal ideas to represent them in
the Chamber of Property. But Victoria
struck the great and wonderful idea of
making only big landlords eligible to sit in the
Upper House, and consequently the interests
of bigotry and class prejudice are better
guarded in that province than in any other.
There are a larger proportion of property-
holders in Victoria than in any other of the
Australian provinces. The property-holder
has the Upper House all to himself, and, by
virtue of his dual vote, he has often a
majority in the Assembly also. When the
Conservative party is uppermost in the
Assembly, the two Houses are unanimous
in helping along the blessed interests of
Property. When the Democratic party is
uppermost, the Council blocks its attempts
at progress and waits peacefully for better
times. Therefore, the odds are always two
to one in favor of the blessed interests of
Property,
* * •
For the Democratic party, the Victorian
Legislative Council is the most complicated
and the most hopeless problem in Australian
politics. Everything else seems to be pos-
sible, but the reform of the Victorian Upper
House by any constitutional means is, to all
appearance, impossible. Yet the fact that it
will be reformed, or abolished, sooner or
later, is sufficiently obvious. Such an
anomaly as this House of 48 rich landlords
cannot possibly go on for ever. And if, as
seems more than probable, the Council
rejects the Land and Income Tax Bill, there
will be an urgent necessity for beginning the
process of reform at once. If that measure
is rejected, then the only apparent alterna-
tives are either to borrow money for revenue
purposes and thus stave off the difficulty
until to-morrow, or to go bankrupt. The
former possibility should not be considered
even for an instant. Under the Munro,
Shiels, and Patterson regimes the country
has already borrowed some three millions
for revenue purposes, in addition to the
many millions previously borrowed for public
works, and if the large landholders of the
Council once more definitely refuse to pay
their share of principal and interest, it is
time to stop borrowing and financing and
striving hopelessly to make ends meet, and
give notice that the province proposes to go
broke, so far as its foreign creditors are con-
cerned, in the most seemly manner that cir-
cumstances will admit. Then Victoria can
remain broke until the Council consents
to pass an Act decreeing its own aboli-
tion, and when that is done, and the
taxation system lias been put on a more
equitable basis, it will be time enough to
resume payment. If the Council remains
obdurate, then the result will be that
the province will remain broke indefinitely.
The natural and logical attitude for the
Assembly to assume is simply this : If the
Council declines to tax itself and its class to
help to pay the public creditor, then it must
efface itself and leave the question of ways
and means entirely to the people’s represen-
tatives, or else the public creditor must slide.
* * *
Hitherto the rich landlords of the Vic-
torian Upper House have travelled on the
assumption that if they refused to tax them-
selves when money was urgently wanted, the
Assembly would lay their share of the bur-
den on the masses rather than allow the
province to default. It has said, in effect, to
the class which the Assembly mainly repre-
sents, that it must make up the deficiency
or else the country must go bankrupt,
and the stupid, dull, patient, ox-like
masses have made up the deficiency
accordingly. But in the present financial
emergency—by far the worst which Victoria
has yet encountered—it is time for the
people’s representatives to present the
Council with its own alternative, and if that
unpatriotic institution adheres to its old
policy then the Assembly will be well-
advised to take it at its word. If the country
defaults in its dealings with its English
creditors through the selfish action of the
Upper House, it will at least arouse the
people of Victoria to a fuller appreciation of
that incubus, and cause them to attempt
some definite effort for its abolition. There
is no legal means by which it can be shifted ;
the only thing which is likely to cause it to
abolish itself is active and universal execra-
tion, and next time the Council deliberately
invites public execration the popular
Chamber, at all events, should do nothing at
all to avert it. What Victoria has to keep
steadily in view is that its House of Bloated
Affluence is almost the worst specimen of its
kind in Christendom; that there is prac-
tically no hope of any important reforms
until it is either obliterated or wholly
altered ; and that it is hardly possible to pay
too high a price for the removal of the
ancient incubus. If the country will only
get and retain a firm hold upon these three
facts, then all the elaborate safeguards of the
Constitution cannot keep the House of the
48 Rich Landlords afloat very much longer.
An Imperial Zollverein,
The Statist (London) offers a prize of £lOOO
for a scheme of Britannic Customs Union. The
Zollverein of Germany governs the trade and
commerce of that extraordinary group of States
on Protectionist principles, under one tariff,
with a success opposed to all economic laws as
exclusively communicated by Nature to the
English and Australian Freetrade press.
Strange indeed it is that the Freetrade Statist
should touch, handle or advertise the “Fair-
trade ” doctrine of a Zollverein for the British
Empire! At present, no doubt, Freetraders are
all aghast in England, and Protectionists all
aglow, while the magazines teem with articles on
what is really the nucleus of a reaction towards
Protection. It will, perhaps, make the matter
clearer to quote the creed of a prominent
English Fairtrader —one Farrer Ecroyd ;
That, in view of the growing injury inflicted upon our
industries by foreign tariffs, and the consequent import-
ance of developing the resources of India and the colo-
nies, it is expedient to free ourselves as early as possible
from the restraints of commercial treaties; to abolish
duties upon tea, coffee, cocoa, and dried fruits imported
from British possessions ; to levy specific duties (in no
case equal to more than 10 per cent, upon ordinary
average values) upon the like articles, as well as upon
wheat, flour, and sugar imported from foreign countries ;
and also to impose an import duty upon foreign manufac-
tures, with the notification that it should cease to operate,
as against each nation, from the day on which such nation
should admit British manufactures duty-free.
The United Kingdom levies duties on tobacco,
tea, spirits, wine, currants, coffee, raisins, and
a few other articles —and the Fairtraders pro-
pose that these duties should be remitted as
against colonies. Consistently enough, the
Cobden Club agrees to this part of the pro-
posal, but objects strenuously to the imposition
of any new duties, either for protection, or re-
taliation, or reciprocity. Governments, it says,
cannot create trade, and they cannot divert it
without diminishing it. And now the Statist
steps in to admit that there is something to be
said against Freetrade. This is the unkindest
cut of all, for the Statist has always hitherto
been a “right-thinking” person.

England’s manufacturing supremacy is being
challenged. By a singular Nemesis, it is Man-
chester that feels the first effects of foreign
competition. Year hy year the total export;
of cotton goods decrease. Here are the figure;;
for a series of years ;—
lbs.
1887 292,615,008
1888 .. 274,829,152
1889 .. 277 0)!,304
1890 .. ' 214,6.1,840
1891 .. 182,008,064
The “ home competition ” in cotton is, of
course, greater each year, hut the manufacturer
appears to think that it is only a question of
time till he is attacked on that market too.
Indeed, it is now reckoned that the Indian
spinner has, for the Eastern trade, an advantage
of at least six-tenths of a penny per lb. over his
Lancashire rival. India increased her cotton
exports to China, Hongkong and Japan from
8 million pounds in ’76 to 115 million pounds
in ’90, in the face of British opposition. If
India thus quickly builds up a trade —and she
has only attempted the coarser textures
so far—what must be feared when other
countries seriously enter the contest? How
important it therefore becomes to Man-
chester that “ the colonial market ” should
be secured against non-British competition !
Despite falling prices, the sterling value of
important manufactured imports into Great
Britain and Ireland shows an increase. Thus
silk manufactures totalled ,£10,269,000 in
1885 and £11,289,000 in 1892. The figures for
woollen manufactures and iron manufactures
have the same aspect :
Woolle's. Iron Man’s.

The impression is gaining ground that the
success of the United Kingdom has been in
many respects due to luck. The invention of
railways by Stephenson was not to be credited
to any fiscal excellence —yet when the world
wanted railways it was England’s lot to have
facilities of supply. Stephenson did a part
and iron and.coal in proximity to the sea-board
did the rest. It was no excellence of England’s
tariff that found Germany divided against her-
self till 16th April, 1871 ; that gave France in-
ternal war through the century and the Franco-
German war and the cruel indemnity to cap it
all; that sent the Civil War to the United
States. England has benefited in the past by
her neighbours’ misfortunes. Their extremity
was her opportunity. In the past she has had
success ; it almost looks now as if she were
going to deserve it. But it must be remem-
bered that the only Zollverein Australia wants
is one of her own provinces.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The logic of Shoddy
Sydney has an incorrigible Free-raider named
E. Pulsford, who is never tired of showing
how Australia may gain the whole world ami
lose her own soul after the mediod of Man-
chester. It never seems to occur to Manchester
missionaries that people may have other aims
in life than trying how to best their neighbours
at a bargain, and build a whited sepulchre of
commercial success full of dead ideals and Mam-
mon’s uncleanness. The hero of Manchester is
the man who jews and screws and scrapes until
he has accumulated a large bank-balance and a
dirty little soul the size of sixpence. Man-
chester’s abomination is the man who doesn’t
make a “ success in life” because he piles up
thoughts and deeds instead of dollars. And
the Pulsfords and M’Millans, the Robert
Reids and Sargoods take for granted that Aus-
tralia is ready to purchase “ trade” at any price
of sordid degradation and national wretched-
ness. The Freetrade game at present is to get
the provinces to lake advantage of the very
liberal clause in the recent British-Japanese
treaty, by which Australian exports are made
welcome in Japan on the trifling condition that
unlimited Japanese are made welcome in
Australia. So E. Pulsford, Esq., takes
a column and a quarter of Sydney Tele-
graph to prove that the exclusion of
Chinese from N.S. Wales by the poll-tax has
not really benefited the province, and that the
sooner poll-taxes are abolished the sooner Aus-
tralian trade with China and Japan will begin
to boom. And, in order to show this, he prints
a table which declares that, in the 11 years,
1878-88, 29,310 Chinese came into N.S. Wales,
while in the five subsequent years, 1889-93, only
94 arrived. In 1886, 3092 came; in 1887, 4436;
in 1888, 1848. Then the poll-tax was clapped
on, and in ’B9, only 7 sad Chinamen came, while
941 went away. In the five years, 1884-88, the
surplus of arrivals over departures was 5514.
In the five years, 1889-93, the surplus of depar-
tures over arrivals was 3378. From which E.
Pulsford draws the astonishing deduction that
the Exclusion Act of ’BB has acted rather as an
Inclusion Act ! This is the result of a cotton
diet on the intellect. E. Pulsford then, in
genuine Manchester fashion, pi’oceeds to point
out how much profit the steamboat companies
lost when their traffic in Chinese was knocked
on the head. Every Free-traitor would be
proud and happy to see Australian workmen
starved out of existence if only “ the steam-
boat companies ” (all run with English money)
made enormous profits. The Chinaman is
indeed the glorious exemplar of the creed
that man was made for £ s. d. He can
work 16 hours a day on a handful of rice,
and he has no ideals, no aspirations. But he
always “ gets on,” and is content to live a dog’s
life and die a dog’s death for the sake of
“getting on.” That’s the man—or rather,
that’s the beast—for the Foreign-traders. But E.
Pulsfohd’s final argument is unworthy of Man-
chester. It seems that Australia owes a debt
of gratitude to China for absorbing silver and
keeping up the price of Broken Hill stock
(which isn’t kept up, by the way), therefore we
should do our utmost to repay the debt by
“not excluding from our shores one large
section of the people who are taking our
silver.” It doesn’t seem to strike this calico


Wesbralia’s coat of arms—a tin-opener and
waterbag.
logician that if the Chinese in China are the
people who take our silver, then, on his own
showing, the more Chinese we bring to Aus-
tralia the fewer there will be left at home to
use that same silver, and, therefore, Broken
Hill stock will fall faster than ever. Nor does
E. Pulsford bother to think that it obviously
pays us better to keep the Chinese at a distance
as customers for our silver than to bring them
close as competitors for our gold. And, lastly,
the argument is a fool of an argument, con-
sidering that whatever silver China does take
from Australia she takes simply because she
wants it, and if she didn’t want it she wouldn’t
take it, and there is no question of gratitude
about the matter. The idea that the man who
sells E. Pulsford a pair of boots should be so
overwhelmingly thankful as to assist him to
open a bootshop next door, is not in accordance
with Manchester maxims, and should be
seriously reconsidered by the little Mogul of
the New South Wales foreign-trade home-slave
party.
Codlin, not Short!
When, in Sept, last, the Vic. elections resulted
so disastrously for the Conservatives, The Bul-
letin drew attention to a letter in the Argus,
vhich disclaimed the title of “Conservative”
as applied in Australia. As then predicted, the
Argus has since continued officially to hint its
desire to be classed as Liberal and Democratic.
Here is a touch of this in reference to the Vic.
Legislative Council:—
The less representative the body the less its moral and
intellectual claim to impose or remit taxation, and after
all it is upon the moral and intellectual claim that these
cases must rest, and not upon the obscure wording of dry-
as-dust statutes, framed by men who did not live in a
democratic generation, and who were not in touch with
democratic ideas.
The claim that the Argus is in touch with
democratic ideas is more courageous than
creditable. The ultimate test of a Conserva-
tive, as of a Democrat, is the Land Question.
Fiscal issues may become mere matters of
expediency, and the form of government may
be settled beyond dispute—but the Land Ques-
tion will not be buried in many a land for
many a day. Whether the community shall
own the land, or the land shall own
the community this is the question
written on the chief line of demarcation
between Democrat and Conservative. The
Democrat decides in favor of the Community
and the Conservative in favor of the Land. In
Victoria, the Argus is found contesting for the
enlargement of the powers of the Council, so
that it shall be co-equal with the Assembly in
matters of taxation. The Vic. Council consists
of property-owners elected by property-owners.
Victoria is the only province of the group that
insists on the property qualification for repre-
sentatives— the amount being fixed at a
minimum of £lOO a year. The Argus
fatuously attempts the juggling trick of
supporting simultaneously a Fat Man
House and its own conceit that it is
a Democratic journal. It disingenuously
instances the practice in South Australia with
regard to money bills, the Council there being
allowed to make “suggestions” to the Assembly
—but S.A. Ms. L.C. receive £2OO a year and
need no property-qualification! It undoubtedly
is anomalous in a democracy to have a bi-
cameral system with one of the Chambers of
imperfect powers—but in the present case it is
not the democracy but the Chamber that is
anomalous, and the sooner it is put on a
democratic basis the better. Meanwhile, the
Argus will do least harm to its real cause by
maintaining a judicious silence about the
blubbery anachronism that does duty for
Victoria’s Second House.
The Failure of Democracy.
Annie Besant is said to be disgusted with the
failure of democracy in Australia, “ and it is
likely that her opinioms»will be expressed in no
hesitating fashion in some of the English
magazines.” A good many other people are
likewise disgusted with the failure of democracy
in Australia, and in many other places as well.
Few of these, however, stop to consider that
monarchy and aristocracy have been failures for
5000 years, or thereabouts, while democracy
only began to be seriously heard of on any large
scale half-a-century ago, and isn’t really
started|yet. When half-a-dozen large, civilised
nations have run an absolutely democratic
Government—a Government where the whole
Legislature, the President, and all the other
powers that be, are elected by adult suffrage
only—for 1000 years, then it will be possible to
decide whether democracy is a failure or
not. The professed democrats who propose to
throw up their faith in disgust because a
few small, obscure states, with a political
system which is one-third democracy and two-
thirds oligarchy, haven’t revolutionised the
world in a single generation, and who therefore
desire to go back to the system which deluged
the earth with blood for fifty centuries, are not
likely to do much good to any cause. They
belong to the class that would give a two-grain
quinine pill to a Methusaleh in the last stage
of leprosy, and demand that he should become
young and healthy again in one act. The
world is very, very old, and diseased, and
rotten, and unwieldy, and ignorant; and it is
debased by countless ages of oppression, and
weighed down by the ghosts and fetishes and
wandering spooks of rnoreold superstitions than
any man can count. It has first to learn by a
long, slow process of evolution what liberty
really is. Then it has to acquire its liberty
and to defend it when acquired. Then it has
to learn how to use it, and if these
processes show any definite sign of ac-
complishment in another ten centuries the
good work will be making reasonable progress.
It has taken monarchical Europe 1400 years,
dating from the time when Europe as a whole
began to have a written history, to acquire the
first faint glimmer of a knowledge that peace i;
better than war, and it has made sucli linio
progress with its lesson that the bloated arm i
merits of to-day are the biggest and most costly
ever known or heard of. Even the Schey and
G. D. Clark type of democracy moves faster
and to better purpose than that.
The N.S.W. Loan Estimates.
The New South Wales loan estimates, put
forward by the Reid Cabinet, are only one
more evidence that one Government, under the
party system, is very like another, and that
every Government very much resembles all the
rest. Each one starts by pointing out the
infamous manner in which its predecessor pro-
duced bogus surpluses by payingcurrent expenses
out of loan moneys, instead of charging them to
revenue, and then goes and does likewise. By-
and-bye, its turn comes to be thrown out of
office with ignominy, and then it is exposed in
its turn, and its successor also goes and
does likewise. And each Government, when
it is found out, defends itself by pointing
out that those who went before it did exactly
the same thing, which defence squares very
badly with the fact that each Government
starts by denouncing its predecessor for doing
that same thing. The present batch of loan
estimates is no better and not much worse
than the average. It includes £74,000 (in
addition to £200,000 already expended) for
dredging and other works at a certain dirty
little creek which flow's into Cook’s River,
which works seem to have no object that
any one can understand. Then there is
an item of £300,000 for dredging and
other work on various rivers; £50,000 for
“thinning out State forests;” fifty or sixty
small items about sew'ers, court-houses, police-
offices, alterations to gaols, repairs and
alterations to a dredge, and the like ;
fragmentary amounts for little, patchy fortifi-
cations, law expenses in connection wdth land
resumptions, supply of water-meters, and other
trifles, one lunatic asylum, and a number of
sundries. Not one of these items even pro-
fesses to be revenue-producing, and a great
many of them are not even permanent public
works. The dredged rivers will fill up again
and want more dredging; the State forests
won’t keep thinned out; the works at the creek
at Cook’s River, as the Attorney-General him-
self cheerfully admits, are so utterly useless
that the sovereigns might as well be thrown
into Sydney harbour; and the law expenses are
not public works at all, even in the widest
sense of the term. The only possible excuse—
and even that is a bad one—which the country
can show for borrowing money, is that it
is to be spent in revenue-producing under-
takings, and hardly one single work in this year’s
category will produce a single copper. Many of
the items are entirely foolish and unjustifiable,
and the balance should have been constructed en-
tirely out of current revenue. If N.S. Wales
only preserves a semblance of solvency now—-
when her revenue is augmented by £2,200,000
per annum derived from the sale of public
lands—by charging nearly £1,000,000 of current
expenditure to loans, her position some time in
the future, when she can raise no more loans
and her land revenues are practically ex-
hausted, will be an interesting study. The
Reid Government, like all its predecessors,
lives on the good old theory that things will last
its time. What may happen in the time of
those who come after it is a matter of no present
importance.
The ignominious back-down of the New South
Wales Council in its recent squabble with the
Assembly is only one more proof of the elabor-
ate uselessness of that pompous institution.
The Council struck out of the Estimates an
item of £216,000, professedly because it felt that
it was its duty to do so, and from motives of
the purest and most high-souled patriotism.
Then, being remonstrated with by the Govern-
ment’s representative, and lectured on the ill-
judged character of its proceedings, it caved-in
and restored the item. No effort whatever was
made to demonstrate that the expenditure of
the £216,000 was wise or justifiable ; the moral
aspect of the case, whatever it might be, was
the same at the end of the trouble as it was at
the beginning. Therefore, the Council, by its
own showing, either wilfully did what it knew
to be wrong and only repented under pressure,
or else it did what it believed to be rig!it and
hadn’t sufficient moral stamina to keep on
doing it. In any case the nominee Upper
House hasn’t the courage of its opinions,
whether these opinions are right or wrong, and,
under such circumstances, the reasons for the
existence of a nominee Upper House are not
apparent. A legislative body which professes
to know what it ought to do, "yet dare not do it,
is of no use to anybody.
For six years in succession Maoriland’s exports
have been, on the average, £3,000,000 in excess
of her imports, the total excess in the six years
being more than £18,000,000. And yet the
province has paid off none of the principal of
her public and private debts in this period, and
has even failed to pay the whole of the interest;
in other words, Maorilaud has been running
further into debt. When the exports for the
year are £3,330,000 in excess of the imports,
then she is just keeping the account square
with her outside creditors ; when the excess is
less than that she is getting deeper in the mire;
when it is more then she is paying off a fraction
of her vast liabilities. In like manner New
South Wales needs to export every year
£5,000,000 worth more than she imports to
meet the interest on her liabilities out of re-
venue ; Victoria needs to show an excess of
£3,400,000, and Queensland of £3,000,000 per
annum. All this has to be done without any
further borrowing or any more “influx of
foreign capital.” In 1892, which was her best
year for a very long time back, N.S. Wales
only went about £5,000,000 to the bad, and
Victoria about £3,000,000, while Queensland
actually reduced her outside liabilities by over
a million. Altogether Australasian finance can
best be depicted by a very small man trying to
shove a very big boulder uphill. He loses an
inch or two all the time while he is doing his
best, and when he eases off the strain for a
moment he loses a yard or two, or from that up
to a mile and a half, before he knows where he
is. Then he desperately buckles to again, and
when he only loses a foot or two he calls it
“satisfactory progress.’’
Rev. W. S. Fkackelton, a Sydney Presby-
terian clergyman, has come to the Conclusion
that Professor Drummond’s book, “ The Ascent
of Man,” much boomed in sciolistic circles, “has
not advanced knowledge one single whit.” It
is a pity that the average religious mind has
not the capacity for Frackeltonian criticism.
From a scientific point of view, Drummond is
merely a purveyor of flapdoodle to feed dog-
matic fools on. His thoughts are all plagiarised,
and his rhetoric merely obscures the truth
which they may have originally conveyed.
But, to the anxious pietist, dimly realising that
religious myths are intellectually “impossible,”
Drummond is welcome because he gives science a
teleological twist and revises creeds to suit the
times. “ The Ascent of Man,” as an unblush-
ing theft, surpasses even “ Natural Law,” and
Mrs. Lynn Linton’s exposure, in a recent Fort-
nightly, of the writer’s amazing impudence
does him rather less than justice. “ The
Ascent ” is merely a fine-language redaction of
scraps of other people’s learning—a boiling-
down of 50 other men’s brains with Drum-
mond’s name tagged to the lot. But the con-
cl ision that a little brass god is perched on top
of the universe is eminently satisfactory to the
friends of Jonah and Co. ; and so, while Spen-
cer’s books don’t sell, stolen Spencer, garish
witli literary fireworks, has enormous vogue.
Spencer is the prophet, and Drummond pockets
the profit.
Now that Brassey has definitely consented to
come forth and “govern” Victoria, it is high
time to settle the vexed salary-question. There
is a weak disposition in Vic. Assembly, and a
rabid desire in the Council, to let Hopetoun’s
successor be engaged “at home” on the old
<£lo,ooo basis, whereby the Government will be
“ in honor bound” to abandon all idea of vice-
regal retrenchment until Brassey has served
his term. It is an awful fact that Vie. Legis-
lature derives a sneaking sense of satisfaction
from this particular waste of public money.
An overpaid Governor serves as an apology for
the sinful extravagance of their Parliament
buildings. That disreputable edifice costs the
country some ,£30,000 or £40,000 a year in mere
interest on capital, yet nobody, thus far, has
suggested a practical scheme for relieving the
country of a ridiculous burden. The ’Ouse,
with its valuable site, would sell for a good
deal of money. It might be converted into
wool-stores, or insurance-offices, or something,
and a galvanised-iron structure, run up cheap on
the reclaimed West Melbourne swamp, would
suit the Senate admirably. The spectacle of
paid legislators lounging into premises worth a
million sterling to discuss a huge national
deficit is Gilbertian in its absurdity.
A book written by Mr. James Hole and just
published in England on the evils of private
railway - ownership, contains a lot of things
which the Australian should think over very
hard. The following are a few of the argu-
ments advanced for State ownership :
Free competition is impo-sible in railways, and must
give way to monopoly, and monopolies should always be
owned and controlled by the Government in the interest
of the people. At the present moment two-thirds of the
entire mileage of English railways are in the possession
of six companies. Out of the 6000 railway-stations in the
United Kingdom, 4600 are in the hands of a monopoly,
the companies charging what they please for passengers
and freight within the limits prescribed by the acts of
Parliament. In the United States there is the same ten-
dency to monopoly. The Pennsylvania railway, which
has a length of 8000 miles is made up out of 70 smaller
lines. Three years ago 2450 minor lines were absorbed
into 33 large companies, which cover 77,000 miles, and
altogether 50,000 miles belong to 75 companies. Thise
monopolies are not satisfactory to the shareholders them-
selves, and it is asserted on good authority that the profit
on American railway investments is steadily but not
slowly diminishing year by year. Of the stock nearly
two-thirds paid no div. whatever, while more than 18 per
cent, even of the bonds were in default. One-fifth of the
American railways are now in the hands of receivers,
while the conflicts of the great railway managers and
speculators have wrought wholesale ruin and destruc-
tion throughout the republic. There are many objec-
tions to private ownership. The railways of the
United States are estimated to spend nearly £3,000,000 per
annum on legal expenses, and there are the lobby agents,
the traffic associations and costly offices, which areisli-
mated to cost nearly ±32,000,000 a ye r in unnecessary
expenditure. In England there is more public cont rol,
and consequently less injurious results, and yet the waste
is very large. The directors, according to the Parlia-
mentary Joint Committee, are far removed from the
influence of the shareholders, and the latter are to a great
extent a fluctuating, ignorant and helpless body. One
authority asserts that many of the directorates are
crowded with titled directors who know’nothing of busi-
ness life and still less of the democratic requirements and
necessities of the present day; and the history of
English railway legislation is one long struggle to
rectify the error made in giving such extensile powers to
private companies. In addition to the-waste caused by
private ownership, are the excessive charges for freight
and the high fares. It is possible to travel all over the
State railways of Belgium for a little more than a
sovereign, and from Salzburg, through Vienna, Prts-
burg, Buda Pesth to Fiume, a distance of 750 miles,
second class, for a guinea. The old notion thatjeompe-
tition wmuld bring down fares and rates has proved to be
quite erroneous. Sir R. Moore, in reply to a deputation
from Staffordshire, remarked :—“ When the London and
North-western was the only railway to Liverpool we
carried your iron at 25 per cent, less ; now you have three
railways and must pay for them.”
The Australian Star, in. prostration before
its Dibbs fetish, acknowledges the New South
Wales Legislative Council thirteen who dared
a deadlock as its Great High Priest :
Happily, the Legislative Council has a great regard for
constitutional principle, and very properly it made a
decided stand against the immoral proceeding of the
Government and the Assembly. Under the circumstances
it did its duty On several occasions during the
past few years it has been forced because of the craven
conduct of the Assembly to take a determined stand in
the interests of the people, and this last stand is the
noblest of all Nine-tenths of the really sensible
voters in the country have confidence in the Council.
Nine-tenths of the voters whom the Star would
call “really sensible” have confidence in wild-
cat banks, in pharisaic swindlers, in snuffle, in
praying for rain, in the Star, and in them-
selves. That fact proves nothing. The Star’s
attitude is the most hideous illustration yet
afforded in New South Wales of the plumbless
depth of abasement to which Party Government
can hurl a devotee. If Beelzebub backed up
Dibbs against Reid, and the Council stood by
Beelzebub, the Star would find it necessary to
champion the Council. The miraculous con-
ception that the House of Fossils has “a great
regard for constitutional principle,” or can
“ take a determined stand in the interests of
the people,” or in any interests but those in
which its members are individually concerned,
is a proof not to be paralleled of the deadly
hypnotism of the Evil Eye of Government by
Contradiction.

A CLERK’S TEMPTATION.
A bank-clkrk was lately summoned to the
manager’s office to receive instructions regarding
X's overdraft. The principal, after his wont, was
smoking one of those fragrant weeds that make a
man happy and render the bystanders envious.
The poor clerk inhaled the lovely, mild aroma and
computed in hip own mind how long it would take
him until he could sit in the same chair and smoke
a similar cigar. Suddenly he saw a yellow card-
board packet on the desk and recognised Erossard's
Cavour cigars. His joy was great, for he knew
that on leaving his office he could go to any
tobacconist, get for one shilling a packet of
eight Cavours and Enjoy himself as well as his
chief. Erossard’s Cavours are smoked by the
millions ; they are a genuine, democratic article
originating from a republican country at a price
everyone can afford to pay, and make life worth
living.

♦
The resurrection, for the severalth time
this year, of “ Charley’s Aunt ” at Sydney
Criterion is progressing rather badly. There are
the rudiments of an audience every night, but not
much more. Much competition, and the fact that
even Charley’s Brazilian relative can’t bear being
revived too often in a short space of time, are
partly responsible for the trouble, and the rest of
it is probably owing to the fact that Mr. G. A.
Seager, though good u many respects, is by no
means a perfect substitute for Thornton. He
doesn’t look half so humorous as that departed
idol, and a large naked spot in the back of his
head, which he doesn’t even attempt to conceal,
oasts dl-credit on his alleged youth, and makes
the fact that he is a giddy Oxford student look
improbable. Seager doesn’t do Thornton’s busi-
ness so well as Thornton did, and he has no new
business of his own worth speaking of. Also, he
is a sk i-chy and somewhat indefinite-looking
person, v mle Thornton was clear-cut and em-
phatic. As a natural result, the aunt doesn’t
loom quite so large as she did, and the comedy
suffers in consequence. The rest of the co. hasn’t
altered to any dreadful extent. Time has left no
fresh blobs on the countenance of the bloated
solicitor, who is, as before, one of the best
characters in the tale, and pretty Blanche Carlyle
has improved considerably in various ways till her
small part has become a thing of some note. The
days of “Charley’s Aunt,” in the present instance,
will probably be few. As already mentioned, it
has been revived too much for these times of
retrenchment.

In the brilliantly-staged “ Cinderella ” at
the Lyceum signs of improvement are manifest,
especially about the leading lady, Miss Ray
J ones. Last week The Bulletin remarked con-
cerning Miss Jones that she was a nice little lady
who sang rather nicely, and it says the same thing
again this week, only with a shade more emphasis.
Also it repeats its commendation of the humorous
stories told by the friend of Mr. Maeintyre, and'
records the fact that the death of Cock Robin has
taken a firm hold on the public, and especially on
the juvenile mind.
* * * *
“The Span of Life,” with which Bland
Holt opened his season at Sydney Royal, is one
of the few melodramas which The Bulletin
regards with cordial approval. There is no
especial reason why it should be called “ The Span
of Life.” Any other name would do as well—in
fact, in almost every melodrama any other name
would do as well; but probably the author con-
sidered that if he called it “ Ham and Eggs ” it
would be less poetic. The new production is one
of the best spectacles on record, and also one of
the best managed. It contains a lighthouse ; a
huge ocean steamer which seems to come straight
at the audience from out of the scenery at the
back of the stage, and just missing destruction by
a hair’s-breadth—not an unusually thick hair
but only the ordinary size—goes away slowly
into the wings; an Arab invasion garnished
by horses and live camels and trimmed
with loud whoops ; an awful chasm across
which three men make a bridge by hanging
on to each other’s feet, while the heroine rushes
across their prostrate forms and escapes her pur-
suers; and many other effects. The steamer is
the best-managed and most realistic thing of its
kind which The Bulletin has yet seen, and the
outbreak of Arabs on camels is a first-class spec-
tacle. B. Holt’s drama also contains about the
most whole-souled and bowelless miscreant going
—a giddy youth who sinks rotten ships for the
sake of the insurance-money, and murders his
brother, and robs his dying mother, and deals in
slaves on the African coast, and otherwise mis-
conducts himself. This person, who is feebly
represented by Mr. Cosgrove, also invents a new
form of homicide, which is almost beyond detec-
tion, and which should be very useful to small
families and schools.
» • •
Mr. Baker, as the good man of the drama,
is at his best, and Baker at his best is about the
finest actor that Australia has produced in our time.
He doesn’t snuffle and look holy in times of pros-
perity, and he doesn’t wail in times of adversity,
and, altogether, he makes the oppressively good
character look real, and healthy, and natural.
Miss Hilda Spong plays well up to his level, and
Mrs. Bland Holt and Bland himself are up to
their usual high standard. Other people and
things deserving favorable comment are Charles
Brown, Nutty Brown, and Miss Flora Anstead (as
a murderous old lady, in a yellow dress), the
scenery, the Arabs, the Leonard family of
acrobats, the troubled sea, the desert, two clever
children named Smith, and other sundries. The
“ Span of Life ” is a con plete and artistic pro-
duction all through, and, as it doesn’t upset
probability any more than is absolutely necessary,
it should have a good future before it.
* * * *
“ The House that Jack Built ” is as gay as
ever, and is joyfully reconstructed at Her
Majesty’s every night, in the presence of a
respectable audience. This panto, might, perhaps,
be made a little more up-to-date if Jack put a
mortgage on the house and was sold up by the
liquidator in the last act; bub we can’t have
everything in this world, and, even in its present
state, the piece is a pleasant affair that goes on its
irrelevant way amid mirth, and red fire, and bril-
liant colorings, and arrives at its irrelevant con-
clusion in a manner that is eminently satisfactory
to all parties concerned.
** * *
The best of all the Xmas shows was the
much-advertised Flying Machine at Chowder Bay
(Sydney). All the “push” and his “donah”
gathered there on Boxing Day, to the number, it
is alleged, of 12,000, and sweltered and drank beer
through the long, hot afternoon, waiting for the
flying of the _ implement which never flew. All
day the machine stood on its tramway getting up
steam and preparing in a dull and hopeless fashion
for the promised performance. It was a humble-
looking thing, cigar-shaped, painted a dull red, and
with canvas wings about 50ft. across. There was
a small boiler in the centre of it, bub no visible
machinery to connect the alleged steam-power with
the pinions, and the whole concern looked about as
active as akedge-anchor. Theenergeticmanagement
kindled a fire in the bowels of the machine early
in the day, and for hours a great column of smoke
went up from it, and a great crowd surged round
and “ poked borak ” at the business manager, and
the treasurer, and the secretary, and the board of
directors. The machine was tied to a tree a good
part of the time to prevent it breaking away pre-
maturely into space. The business-manager went
round with a worried expression like a man who
had much on his mind, and smiled a joyless smile
as the crowd urged him to “ let her fly.” As the
afternoon went on it somehow became generally
understood that if the machine didn’t do some-
thing the manager would be badly “ stoushed,”
and the excitement grew tremendous. At last
about 4 p.m., when the bay was full of
steamers, sailing-boats and skiffs, and the
crowd on shore was thickest and most
profane, the rope was let go, and the Flying
Machine stumbled heavily down its tramway and
fell over, with a loud noise, on to the beach.
There it promptly took fire and the show was
over. A chest of drawers or a dead goat would
have fallen quite as gracefully, and no more
decisively. For a few seconds the assembled push
had a vague idea of rolling the management down
also, but, thinking better of it, contented itself
with rushing down to the beach and cheering the
combusted machine, and kicking the ruins of it.
Then, after one or two irrelevant free-fights, the
show terminated, and the problem of serial navi-
gation remains unsolved. It is vaguely estimated
that 8000 long-beers were consumed during the
experiment, which goes to prove that the vexed
question can’t be settled by beer, anyhow.
However, of the panto, at Melb. Princess’s
and everywhere else, it can be stated, as a weird
fact, that the remarks which fairly apply to them
one week may have very little bearing upon the
performance of a week later. “ Beauty and the
Beast ” got by no means the best start on record
for aW. and M. show. It has improved its form
wonderfully since then, and is doubtless in eager
search after any novelty likely to aggravate
Xmas merriment.
** * *
The Melbourne Royal panto, is some
degrees less incoherent than its rival up the
street. Also, “ Aladdin ”is a more profusely-
topicalised subject, and it contains a larger
amount of corporal punishment on the seat of
“ wholesome fun.” Likewise, Maggie Moore is
the youth who buys the Emperor of China’s
daughter with a bagful of strange rubies, a cir-
cumstance that guarantees an atmosphere of good
humor in the house. A lack of grotesque dancing
and a scarcity of songs with catchy me ! "dies were
urged against “Aladdin” on Boxing Night, but
this latter defect may loom smaller when some of
the ditties that are furnished with lugubrious
tunes have been cut short or abandoned alto-
gether. Considered as a large and thickly-popu-
lated entertainment, at reduced prices, it seems
bound to prosper. A display of juvenile talent
early in the first act includes at least two or three
lively items, and is a distinct improvement upon
the dark traditional opening scene, where the
wicked gnome rumbles unnecessary remarks
through a bloated mask to a mob of prehistoric
insects. The irrelevant Spirit of Delirium
Tremens has been wisely dispensed with.

The working staff of the panto, com-
prises (besides Miss Maggie Aladdin) H. R.
Roberts as Widow Twankey, Miss Laura Roberts,
a padded edition of Oily Deering in the royal
dressing-gown of a Chinese emperor, several other
people, and a battalion of supernumeraries. Pro-
cessions are tolerably long and frequent, and the
light of Chinese lanterns is shed upon sundry
feasts at which refreshments are not provided. A
few ballets acquit themselves creditably, but the
well-matured brand of bounder, who has brought
up 16 offspring, and buried most of them in the
cold cemetery, appears no more. The grand-
children are (jetting a chance this year,

The Judge,” produced at Melb. Bijou on
Boxing Night, will not sentence himself to more
than 14 days, if he doesn’t get off with a week.
Improbability exceeds the limit of humor in this
farcical comedy. The germ of human interest is
not there. No respectable middle-class under-
standing can accept a plot that radiates from a
wax baby boy, who gets the wind on his small
stomach and is heard crying in the next room.
The spurious yell of a counterfeit infant plays a
leading part in “ The Judge,” and its character is
quite as real as any printed on the bill. Elton,
Shine, Geo. Ireland, Diver, Miss Clara Thomp-
son, Miss Katherine Hardy, and Miss Nannie
Harding gave valuable support, the ladies scoring
heavily when the baby is present. As for Elton,
he gets captured by a reckless married lady whilst
in the act of bathing his feet, and for 90 minutes,
or thereabouts, he does little beyond doddering to
and fro his bedroom in charge of a feeding-bottle.

George Darrell’s revival of “The Double
Event,” at Melb. Opera House was not the suc-
cess it might have been under happier sporting
circumstances, and (possibly because he couldn’t
find time to turn Melb. Cup into a cricket-match
and construct a sensational attempt by “Tiger”
to poison the Australian Eleven in their stable)
George decided to withdraw “The Double
Event ’’ after Monday. On New Year’s night he
was to set up “The Nightmare,’’ a farcical
comedy which sounds suitable to the season. The
management should supply every visitor to the
dress-circle with a mince-pie, slack backed. The
Nightmare 1

A pressman used to tell a luscious story of
how (unknown, you may be sure, to the manage-
ment) he and some friends interviewed the airy
fairy Bartho in her dressing-room at Melbourne
Princess’s, during the Blue Ballet period. Bartho
didn’t know a word of English,, but she was
anxious to make herself agreeable to the visitor,
and promptly fell in with a suggestion 'that
she should display her wonderful maiden .vigor
in a little tug-of-war. The shapely danseuse
caught hold of the pressman’s hands, planted her
kid shoes firmly against his boots, and then the
two young people started to pull. It is possible
that Bartho could have won the contest easily,
but, instead of suddenly landing the strange gen-
tleman upon her powdered shoulder, she elected
to fall forward against his chest with a bashful
“bposhter,” and he was declared the victor.
Tears come into the eyes of that favored journal-
ist when he relates the incident, and dilates upon
the blissfulness of the moment when Bartho
collided with his shirt-front.

The Dacres will probably make their Aus-
tralian debut in “Esther Sandraz,” a very
emotional play by Sydney Grundy. The
heroine’s character was written for Mrs. D. By-
the-way, they cabled word, before leaving London,
that a heavy lady and “ a most delightful ingenue ”
were coming with them. The name of the delight-
ful young thing was not stated.

Brisbane has given such a poor return to
theatrical managers for the last two or three years
that it has now to put up with very sorry shows
indeed. On Boxing Night a scratch co. sup-
ported Miss Ada Rochefort, at the Opera House,
in a sad hash called ‘‘Erma the Elf.’’ The little
Gaiety was crammed for a ‘‘Red Riding Hood ”
pantomime, produced by York and Jones with
some attempt at magnificence. Edith Moore is
star; and I here is such a cavernous absence of
decent amusement up North that the venture will
probably pay.
** * *
Adelaide has been without a theatrical co.
since Charles Arnold left; even at Xmas, the only
bill of fare was that of a second-rate dramatic co.
at the Royal. Hudson’s Bijou was closed ! The
holy city simply gasps for a good manager, with
money and a small theatre.
“ Beauty and the Beast ” as now beheld at the
Princess’s,
- h a sadder, slower festival than many of its
class;
There’s not a grain of meaning in the heroine’s
distresses,
And nothing seems to happen when it ought to
come to pass.
But the mounting is expensive, and the fashion of
the dresses
Reminds one of a preacher crying “flesh is only
grass !”
Transformation Scene is full of clever colour-
scheming
With an unattired damsel made a feature of the
show;
And fays are carried upwards till their legs alone
are gleaming
In the limelight, hanging limply o’er the spec-
tacle below,
Which is painfully suggestive of the late-lamented
Deeming,
When he negligently dangled from the gallows,
long ago.
A mummer fresh from Hingland is unquestion-
ably clever
On the lines of “Dismal Teddy” (who could
work like any boss) ;
We must give this stranger credit for his Lonnen-
like endeavour
To be very, very funny, though his humour
makes us cross.
And had the spirit moved him to remain away
forever
We don’t believe the country would have
suffered from a loss,
A tall and tuneful charmer is the leading “boy,'
Luella —
She ought to get some brighter opportunities to
graft ;
Miss Beauty sings a little like a delicate rosella
Exclaiming, “Pretty Joey” after sitting in a
draught.
And the wheezes of her brothers ! They were
growing sere and yellah
When Noah used to try ’em on his sons, who
never laughed.
A sigh for Nellie Stewart, airy Bartho, cannie
Lauri —
They did their best in Sydney for this “ annual ”
inane :
They tinged its leaden dullness with the bright-
ness of their glory, ‘
Though they couldn’t change the product of the
demon author’s brain.
Now, another crowd is wading through the same
old sloppy story.
And Williamson and Musgrove are producing it
again.
When the kindly crimson curtains gently close
upon the folly,
And the crowded congregation has departed in
a heap,
Perhaps the clown imagines that the pantomime
was jolly,
Because he spotted someone who forgot to fall
asleep.
But where are words to picture the pathetic melan-
choly
Of a parent feigning laughter lest the little ones
might weep ?
At Poverty Point.
Daisy Yarmouth and Lucy Don, in Melb. Theatre Royal
panto., are veteran George Ooppin’s daughters, who
appear for the first time.
Yarmouth having declined to skirt-dance any more, an
emulous Melbourneite notifies his appearance in that line.
H.: “Before the Varley-Tapley wedding, I wrote, in
The Bulletin, suggesting its postponement for a year 01
two, in the interests of the bright and ambitions lilt'<•
prima donna, because marriage reduces the value of such
an artiste 40 per cent. This is the cruelty, and perhap
wickedness, of the public. They hate to see husband ami
wife love-making on the stage. Nay, some managers will
not employ both husband and wife, but say, “ Either of
you. Take your choice.”
Maggie Moore gets £5O a week during the run of the
Melb. T.R. panto.
Gracie Plaisted, we read, has just married her fourth
husband. There is a lesson in woman-nature for you
The Australian public who didn’t know, gushed over
Gracie as an innocent, unsophisticated little dear.
There is a row on between'two of the Sydney show-
houses, one of which refused the principals of the other
complimentary admission at a recent matinee. Certainly
an almost unheard-of proceeding.
Alice Saker (the “ Beauty ” of Melb. Princess panto.) is
reminiscent of Alice Leamar, but has not the ta-ra-ra
plumpness or, seemingly, the fondness for naughty songs.
Alfred Saker is a compromise between Leslie and Court-
neidge, with Lonnen’s bony appearance in tights.
The Bulletin regrets to notice that a very clever young
Melb. man is “always to be seen” at Joe Thompson’s
London academy for fools. But, then, he always wins—-so
he says.
Melbourne piety shuts theatres, but opens pubs, Xmas
Day.
Marie Luella, principal hoy in the Melb. Princess panto-
mime', is divinely tall and {i.e., her wig is) divinely fair.
She has a perfect figure ; limbs that delicately taper from
an elegant and substantial circumference down to the
shapely penultimate thinness of a pencil’s point; and a
poise of the head as graceful as a swan’s. Her fault is a
way of biting her words as though afraid to let them come
out of her mouth whole. But the Firm has to be con-
gratulated on Marie Luella.
No Melb. Panto, “boy” of late years has approached
Marie Luella in sheer sweetness —perhaps not even
Billee Barlow. The face of Marie recalls Lelia Roze a
little, but her voice is resonant and strong,
Topsy Hill is the name of a budding Vio. contralto,
from whom great things are expected. She has been
brought up at Lilydale, Ihe picturesque village where
Melba’s childhood was spent, and where David Mitchell
still reigns in a palace of lime and cement.
Charles Holloway opened at Adelaide with a melo-
dramatic co. on Boxing Night. The veteran James F.
Cathcart is in the caste.
Madame Richard, of Paris, report* that her pupil, Mdlle
Lalla Miranda, has une vraie voix d’oiseau, is very intelli
gent and studious, and will certainly make a big name as
a light soprano singer. By the way, The Bulletin anti-
cipated the French lady, some time back, with the remark
that Lalla “ sings like a bird.”
There can he now no doubt as to the financial success
of “ John-5,-Dreams,” says The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent. The advance booking is said to be pheno-
menal. Haddon Chambers must be piling up money, for
“ The Fatal Card ” is also drawing enormous houses.
Clement Scott has an innuendo respecting the simi-
larity of “The Masqueraders” and “John-i-Dreams,”
inasmuch as in both plays there are two women and a
dreamy man. Chambers has disposed of this by telling
that long before H. A. Jones hatched “The Mas-
queraders,” he (Chambers) had shown him the sketch of
the plot of “ John-a-Dreams ” (which he then wished to
call “Two Women and a Man ”), so that H.A. clearly
lifted the idea from his friend.
Haddon Chambers has been accused of plagiarism in
drawing the character of Kate Cloud, which, it is said,
was taken from Paula Tanqueray. It has now been
shown, writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent,
that “John-5, Dreams” was in part written long before
the “ Second Mrs. Tanqueray ” was produced or heard of,
and Chambers, so far from being a literary larcenist, has
been the victim of “ the long arm of coincidence.” The
more one sees the play the better one likes it. It is far
and away beyond anything Haddon has done bifore, and
the public verdict is that it is also far and away beyond
anything done by most of the living dramatists. But it
wants a lot of acting, and will no doubt suffer from this
cause when it comes to be produced in Australia, for you
don’t get a Tree or a Mrs. Pat. Campbell, nor a Cartwright
and a Janette Stcere, every day.
Handsome Carrie Ireland has retired from Bland Holt’s
combination, after a creditable connection of some three
years. She shortly goes with Ireland, pire, for an ArjAralian
tour as leading lady in a co. which the veteran is now
organising.
Amy Roselle, who, with her husband, Arthur Dacre,
will be in Austr lia shortly, understudied Ellen Terry for
some months at London Lyceum Theatre. She was also
the Hermione in Mary Anderson’s revival of the bard’s
“ Winter’s Tale ” some years ago. Mary played Perdila,
but was so far overshadowed by Amy Roselle that the
story went she became jealous and loved “A Winter’s
Tale ” no longer.
Vio’et Cameron is billed at a London music-hall. The
announct merit in the papers runs this way : “Miss Violet
Cameron will appear at the Alhambra ; also, Parker’s
dogs.”
The lady who used to be handed on, at the Melb. music-
hall, now has to sit in the semi-circle and smile, while
another lady is handed on.
War is raging in the ranks of the Johnnies who run the
Melb. Lyric Club. “Marjorie” landed them in a debt
of something like £4OO, and a call of £2 10s. has been

The Wild-Cat Column.
The S.M. Herald and the irrepressible
<> Wingen” Abbott are now writing at great length to
point out that N.S. Wales should not float its loans
locally, but in London. “To borrow locally, simply to
keep the interest in the colony,” says the Herald, “is no
more sensible than to do work locally for the sake of
employing people if the cost to the State is thereby
increased.” As the State is the people this practically
means—supposing it does cost more to borrow in Aus-
tralia, which, by the way, is a mere assumption resting
on no visible evidence—that in the Herald’s opinion it is
better to pay 31 per cent, to somebody else than to pay
4 per cent, to oneself. As a crushing argument against
local borrowing the Herald points out that Treasurer
See’s 4 per cent, loan, issued at 100, is now worth
—which, by the way, it is not-so that the province has
lost £6 10s. on every £lOO. An equally painful and
equally relevant fact is that a 3£ per cent, loan floated,
not very long ago, in London at £9O 145., is now selling at
over £lOO, so that, in this instance, the province has lost
£9 6s. per £lOO.
As a matter of fact, the miserable province
always does lose on its borrowing transactions, and there
is no evidence to prove that it will lose more by borrowing
in Sydney than in London. Anyhow, a loan of £1,000,000
at 4 per cent, means the payment, in half a century, of
£2,000,000 in interest, and if the Herald considers that
Australia will be no better for keeping that amount in-
stead of sending it to a foreign country it only shows
what a vast and comprehensive fool that paper can make
of itself when it tries. The Bulletin believes that money
can be obtained as cheaply in Australia as in England,
but even if it can’t that fact makes no difference. It is
better to pay 4 per cent, to oneself than per cent, to
somebody at the other side of the world, especially if the
dividends are made subject to absentee-tax, so as to
prevent the debentures drifting into the hands of foreign
investors.
Wingen Abbott, by the way, bases his argu-
ment on the assertion that “to borrow in London is to
bring in fresh capital and increase local competition,
thus helping to bring down interest.” The statement
would be much more accurate if it were turned upside-
down. To borrow in London is to send out fresh capital,
and thus ultimately reduce local competition, and send
up interest. If the country borrows £10,000,000 to-day,
in the course of half a century, making no allowance for
compound interest, it sends away £20,000,000 in interest
alone, and this looks a lot more like taking capital out
than bringing it in. Australia has already sent back to
England nearly all its borrowed capital in interest, and
has to keep on sending it qver and over again for ever and
ever. The man who first invented the theory that bor-
rowing brings capital into the country was a short-sighted
mortal. Australia would have been one of the richest
lands on earth if it had never brought in any borrowed
capital. As it is, it bids fair to be among the poorest.
The ways of the reconstructed bank are past
finding out. When last heard of, the National Bank had
£1,570,000 in cash on hand, and £1,500,000 in liquid secu-
rities. This amount was vastly in excess of any possible
demands, and halt of it was bearing no interest whatever.
The National might have used at least £500,000 of it in
paying off reconstructed deposits and never missed it,
and by so doing it would have saved £22,500 a year in
interest and practically doubled its profits. The Victoria,
with £1,200,000 in cash, could have done likewise, and
also saved £22,500 per annum off its interest burden. Yet
neither institution makes a move
A foolish yearning after gigantic cash reserves,
which are of no present use, and yield no interest, and
only serve the same, purpose as a nightmare, is weighing
down the Australian banks. The craving has assumed
such an aggravated form that even to save the share-
holders £22,500 per annum the scared board of directors
won’t part with a fraction of the useless hoard.

Melbourne Trams have been rising steadily for
several weeks, and now a gleam of real joy comes along in
the shape of a 5 per cent. div. The div. is owing partly

copper, but none the less it is the most promising piece
of news which Melbourne has heard for a long time past.

Another colliers’ strike threatens at Newcastle,
N.S.W. The masters insist on a reduction of wages,
which are already down to the subsistence minimum,
considering that most of the men only work half-time ;
and starvation seems imminent either way. Newcastle
trade has fallen off so much during the past five years—
partly through successful competition in foreign markets,
and partly through the development of Victorian collieries
—that there is now a large surplus of the labor which easily
found employment in more prosperous days. There is
little doubt, how'ever, that most of the mines could well
continue to pay the present rates if the owners were
satisfied with a shade less profit.

Yic. Assembly has decided, by 51 votes against

deserving of such relief than land-jobbing institutions,

That baby institution, the National Bank of
Tasmania, reports having made a net profit in the past

cent, per an. div., and carries forward £133 to strengthen
its position. The National, with its capital of £152,000,
and its £22,500 of reserve, wouldn’t be much of a bank
anywhere except in peaceful Tasmania, but in that isle of
lotus-eaters where booms are few and mild, and panics are
of rare occurrence, and no one gives way to unseemly

An hotel descended from the father to the
mother, to the son, and finally to the sister, death being
the cause; the freehold belonged to the brewery, and
the tenants having been homely people, had no lease.
Being desirous of selling, the brewers were applied
to for a lease, and, after much demur, one with
stringent clauses was granted. On objection being raised
to the clauses, it was promptly squelched, with the
remark, “That or nothing.” On compulsory acceptance,
a buyer was sought, and after many had been submitted,
one was approved. But before the brewers would sign
the transfer they insisted on receiving a bonus of £so—
at the time of the application, they were
advised of the intention to sell. Yet a “Brewery
Manager” concludes a letter to the Argus thus: “The
retail trade, if they speak honestly, will say that breweries
are cordial, just, and liberal, so long as the retailer keeps
to the straight track.”

It would be interesting to learn what is the
exact present position of the Hillgrove and Armidale
Water-power Electric Co. This 00. had a private bill
passed by last N.S. Wales Parliament giving it water-
rights and the necessary authority, &c. In the bill it
was provided that electric power for working the Hill-
grove mines and light for lighting Hillgrove township
would be generated, and the co. was given 18 months in
which to carry the Act into effect. It is understood that
on the very last day allowed under the Act, it generated
enough electricity to feed some lamps, but the main object
of the Act—that of generating power—does not appear to
have been effected, nor up to the present does electric
power seem to have been supplied to any of the mines.
Do the promoters take for granted that because they
generated a certain amount of electricity they saved their
Act, and that they can produce the electric motive power
at their own sweet will? Did the Govt, send a repre-
sentative officer to inspect the works and ascertain if they
were completely erected and in working order by the
limited time allowed by the private Act, and if not, why
not? Syndicates have still an easy time in dealing with
Parliament.

When Sydney (Municipal) Electrio Lighting
Bill comes for second reading, the democratic party
should make every possible move to have the sixth clause
withdrawn. By it power is given to the Municipal Coun-
cil to hire or purchase tin- ligh' (in bulk) from any 00. or
syndicate, instead of erecting its own works and maun
factoring for itself. Should this clause be retained, it
will play right into the pockets of the Colo and Grose and
cuier grabsters, who would thus hold in their clutch the
wmle of the City of Sydney. It is more than suspected
that the balance of aldermanic influence is favorable to so-
called “private enterprise,” and the opposition to the
clause should therefore be all the more compact and
determined.

This is how a certain well-known financier does
his business. The applicant for a loan is asked to furnish
full particulars, to leave documents, and to call again.
Should all be right, on the next visit he is informed that
a loan will be granted, but no definite sum is fixed, and
he is instructed to call a third time. At the final visit
the amount is settled, and the financier calls in his book-
keeper, who produces a mortgage or assignment of inter-
est in which the amount is not filled in. Then a cheque
is made out, payable to client’s order, but with the
amount blank. The financier signs this, and requests the
client to endorse it, “ so that the clerk can fill in the
amount and get the cash from the bank.” The bor-
rower endorses it accordingly, and the clerk leaves with
it. During his absence the deed is signed, still with the
amount in blank, “as the bookkeeper does all that
work the clerk returns, the money' is paid over, and
the borrower leaves. The cheque has never gone to the
bank, and it and the deed are now filled in for as large a
sum as the shecurity will stand. The cheque is then
taken to the bank and cashed in gold. By which com-
plication of devices the usurer has the evidence of the
signed deed and the endorsed cheque, and of himself and
his factotum and the bank ledger, against the bare testi-
mony of the borrower. Consequently, the borrower’s
attempt to dispute the claim is apt to end in his committal
for perjury.

A poor Melb. widow, in need of .£5 for an

6d. tram-fare) and got a “loan” of £7 25., of which £5
only was cash and £2 2s. a receipt (unstamped, and
thereby may hang a prosecution) for costs of bill-of-sale.
At the end of 19 months the widow had paid £lO to the
usurers, of which no part went to repay the principal, the
lenders claiming a balance due of £l5 for principal and
arrears of interest. The Herald put a solicitor on the

One reason why every Australian gold-mine
floated in England has a vast, unwieldy capital, so large
that it makes divs. all but hopeless, is that the English
investor has a secret love for such things. He regards t he
stupendous capital as being, somehow or other, a proof of
the solidity of the enterprise, and no amount of experi-
ence seems to convince him to the contrary. His utterly
wooden-headed fatuousness in this respect should do a
lot to destroy the Australian’s reverence for him as a
financial authority, but somehow it doesn’t, and the
opinions of this person who doesn’t know how to come in
out of the wet are still bumptiously cabled to Australia
as matters of serious importance. Altogether, it is diffi-
cult to decide whether the muddled creature at the other
end of the wire, who sends out his financial criticisms on
things which he doesn’t understand, or the muddled
creature at this end, who receives them with such solemn
reverence, is the more pitiable.

The chief mines work a reef running up to eight-feet
thick. The grade is low, from sto lOdwts.
The Island, at Lake Austin, has two parallel
lines of reef consisting of the hungry-looking white sto ie
so common in Westralia, with bunches of rich gold quartz
in pockets through the veins. The mines are the Golconda
and the Chicago. Outside the few rich pockets found in
these reefs the quartz is poor, so that no difficulty in
picking the ore to any richness presents itself.

The Mainland Consolidated, three miles N. of
the Island, has a similar formation. The claims are
known as the Mainland Dalys, the Last Chance, and the
Blocks, and have produced among them about 5000 oz
daring the last 18 months. The ore-shoots are very short,
some 6 to 10ft., and the richest ore occurs in pockets in
these. Development has engendered the suspicion that
gold will diminish with depth.

Melbourne is being actively exploited by all the
Westralian wild-eat-mongers who can’t raise the passage-
money to London. The business doesn’t prosper much,
however. What the average Melbourne broker doesn’t
know about mining is hardly worth mentioning.

The secretary of Coolgardie hospital writes the
Eastern press with a view of di -proving the alarmist state-
ments made as to the hospital being crowded with fever
patients. He states that at the date of his letter (Dec.
14th) there were but 20 cases of fever, none dangerous,
and that no deaths had occurred during the previous
week from that disease. He does not, however, set o< t
the accommodation of the hospital, in which, at latest,
there were 22 patients.

The late strike at Hannan’s appears to have been
a godsend to the Boulder crowd, whose 24 leases are said
not to have yet given enough gold to pay for the men’s
water. Over 200 men were employed, and the leaders in
the strike had determined beforehand to throw up their
job and go prospecting. But it was rough on the po >r
devils who had just been taken on.

The Perseverance (Hannan’s) has just been sold
to an English syndicate. It was originally taken up by
Pung, Rose and party, who also had the" Black Crow,
now known as Star of the East. They abandoned the
latter, thinking it no good ; then the present proprietors
got hold of it. While MTntosh was floating the Per-
severance, in Melbourne, the holders dollied for wages out
of the reef.

Dec. Review of Reviews awkward
name—heads an interview with Mr. Service with
the statement that W.A. has a nominee second
chamber, which will considerably astonish the
score of councillors elected a few months ago
under “the changed constitution. Even when the
Review brings its history up to date, and alleges,
in regard to the recent Q. Assembly division which
kept the Govt, in office by a majority of one,
that “ the Labor members shrunk from appearing
before their constituents . . . two of them
remained outside the bar of the House,” it is not
more happy. A more malicious fib it would be
hard to utter, seeing that every Labor member
polled his vote, and that the two who stayed out-
side the bar were Govt, supporters. But the
Australian section of the Review now stinks of
high-Toryism afar off.
Cabled that “Journeyman Judge” Wren-
fordsley (who humped bluey all over Australia in
the hope of finding a permanent billet and an easy
pension), suggests that a Federal Council for Aus-
tralia should be constituted from the existing
Legislative Councils ! The ghastly ignorance of
Australasian sentiment expressed in such a propo-
sition should entitle Mr. Wrenfordsley to a leather
medal in any competition open only to superlative
idiots. Almost as well might the ex-Judge sug-
gest to the voters of Australia that a Federal
Council should be constituted of such British peers
as happen to have visited the country.
In last week’s Bulletin was reprinted a
statement, which had apparently been widely cir-
culated in the provincial press, to the effect that a
popular Sydney suburban station-master was, when
in Britain, the superior officer of Chief Commis-
sioner Eddy. The Bulletin is assured that there
is no truth in the statement, and, as it appears to
have caused annoyance to the station-master in
question, who is in no way responsible for its cir-
culation, we have to express our regret for its pub-
lication.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback - the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex
trashed, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory mav be had by nnv'uio who maker
a continuous use of Uncle Toby's Rolled Oats.

ON A XMAS HOLIDAY .
The clever H. H. Champion is now per-
manently located at Melbourne. His imaginary
“ gentlemanliness ”is his weak point. He wants
to run with the democratic hare and hunt with
the upper-middle-class hounds. The result is that
he is too much of a right-thinking person to be a
reliable socialist, and too much of a socialist to be
an acceptable “gentleman.”
Parson Bevan, the Melb. long woolled
merino, developes a most surprising likeness to
Henrik Ibsen. Some people lay themselves out
for these resemblances. Hewlett Ross, secretary
of the newly-formed Melb. Fabian Society, bears
a most remarkable resemblance to some of the
portraits of Shakespeare. Up to now, however,
the resemblance has not broken out inside, as it
were.
Young Longstaff, the Yic. “travelling-
scholarship” artist, has sent along to Melb.
National Gallery, on loan, a beautiful portrait of
a lady that would do credit to any painter on
earth. The sitter—who stands in the picture—
is doubtless a brainy, soulful nervous subject of
the Ellen Terry type. Longstaff seems to have
accentuated each charm of her poetic face, and the
lady who smiles at one from the canvas is almost
too interestingly natural for this life.

Captain M‘lntosh, of the ill-fated Waira-
rapa, owned a Scotch terrier which invariably
accompanied him on his voyages. Prior to the
last departure of the boat, the captain and his dog
were staying with a St. Kilda friend, but when
the time came for sailing the dog was missing, and
the ship that never returned pursued her course to
Barrier Island without it. When she had been
gone a day or two, however, Toby re-appeared
at St. Kilda, and has been there ever since.
It is printed that long ago T. S. Mort,
attracted by a letter of G. H. Reid’s in the news-
paper, “sought him out and became one of his
intimate friends,” and on one occasion when
entertaining a large parly of guests at “ Green-
o vkes,” he directed a lady’s attention to a young
man at the other end of the drawing-room.
“That young man,” said Mort, “will one day be
Premier of N.S.W.” The point of the story is
that it was told by Georgey-Porgey himself to a
(Cosmos) interviewer.
Premier Reid, of N.S.W., is credited with
being able to sleep at will. Mr. Reid, who has
lately spoken of himself as “a youngster,” denies
that he is 52—he will be 50 this year. Apropos of
which Sydney Star remarks that Napoleon died
at 52, and Alexander the Great at 33, Hannibal’s
age when he crossed the Alps. At 45, Caesar con-
quered Britain, and Pitt died at 47. There have
been half-a-dozen younger Premiers in Australia.
Mr. Kingston is at present but 44, Forrest, 47.
Griffith (Premier at 38) is now 49 and Chief Jus-
tice of Queensland.
Mrs. Helen Stannard, who fills library
shelves with third-rate novels under the pen-name
of “John Strange Winter,” thinks she disposes of
the proofs of the intellectual inferiority of woman
by an argumentum ad hominem directed against
Mr. Hall Caine. She says she has married and
reared children, sold 1J million books, and made
a general success of life ; while H.C. is a frail man
who, when-Ac writes a book, is thoroughly ex-
hausted. “Therefore,” says Mrs. S., “I fail to
see where his immense superiority over me comes
in.” Well, it comes in the utter inferiority of the
lady’s books. Fifty thousand “John Strange
Winters” could not write one “Bondman.”
Says a Bulletin corres-
pondent ; In view of the as-
sertions made with regard to
the wealth taken by Mrs.
Besant from Australia, a plain
statement of facta will interest
Bulletin readers. Almost
every penny of Mrs. Besant’s
earnings as a lecturer, under
the Smythe regime, goes to
cancel the liabilities of the
Theosophical Literature Pub-
lishing Fund, in London.
Mrs. Besant is the great
money-earner of the Theoso-
phical Society, and as it was
mainly at her instance that
the society incurred the great
expense of publishing H.P.B. ’s
“Secret Doctrine” and other
works, she felt that it was her
primary duty to liquidate, by
her own efforts, the debts thus
incurred. With regard to her
share of the “ enormous ” pro-
ceeds of her recent lectures in
Australia, it is sufficient to
say that she had not the least
idea that such a monetary
value attached to her dis-
courses as has proved to be
the case. For instance, her
proportion of the Sydney pro-
ceeds was <£79 17s. 7d., of
which all save £5 was re-
mitted to Mrs. Coeper-Oakley,
at the Theosophical Society’s
literary dep.it in Loudon, and
the £5 went in douceurs to
servants, steamboat-stewards,
and such likeinevitable para-
sites of the traveller. —G.
Henry Burton Bradley, the oldest practis-
ing solicitor in Australia, died at Sydney last
week in his 80th year. He came to Australia with
his uncle, the late Judge Burton, of the N.S.W.
Supreme Court, to whom he was clerk for many
years. He acted in that capacity, it is understood,
at the memorable trial of John Knatchbull for the
murder of Mrs. Jamieson in Kent st., Sydney.
There is yet an older attorney, though retired from
practice—Mr. B. O. Rodd, of Five Dock, who was
admitted as far back as 1833. It is singular that
Mr. Bradley, who devoted all his spare time to
sanitary reform, should die of typhoid.
While the greasy panegyrist was at work
on the N.S.W. Supreme Court Judges in the cur-
rent Review of Reviews, he might surely have
given a statement of the pleasing and dignified
methods adopted in the Mount Rennie trial by
His Honor Mr. Justice Windeyer. A bare re-
cital of the circumstances attendant on that,
memorable affair would have been enough to for
ever embastion the judicial reputation of the
learned and lucky personage who (amongst Ids
other shining qualities) is, we read, “just a trifle
too suspicious to be imposed on.” Spooks of Cisam

Mr. HARRY GOODWIN.
Harry Goodwin (whose portrait appears in
this issue) is champion of Sydney Amateur Walk-
ing Club, and, if all goes well, means to be
amateur champion walker of Australasia. Since
21st Sept., 1893, when his walking career com-
menced, Goodwin has started in seven handicaps,
finishing five times Ist, once 2nd, and once 3rd.
On the grass track at Kensington Race-
course this year he covered If mile in 13rnin,
41|secs, At Sydney Harrier Sports on Aug. 25 he
did the mile in 7min. 2secs, ; and on Sept. 22, at
the Public Schools Sports, the same distance in
6min. 34secs. ; both performances on grass. The
latter time (6*34) is 25 seconds inside the Aus-
tralian record, but Goodwin’s application for
a record was disallowed because but two time-
keepers took the race; the Amateur Athletic
Association requiring three. On Nov. 15 Good-
win walked 1,2, and 3 miles for a record, on N.
Sydney Reserve, and was successful at each dis-
tance. He did the mile in 7'6 4-5, 2 miles in 15*44-5,
and 3 miles in 23-13 l-sseos. The 3 miles record
was disallowed owing to two cautions having been
administered, and the two-mile record is at present
under review by the council of the Amateur
Athletic Association.
Roger Tichborne graduated at the Jesuits
college at Stonyhurst and served two years in the
Dragoon Guards. Yet in 1866 the Claimant wrote
to Lady Tichborne, his “dear mother,” a letter
containing this :
1 do not wicsh any person to know me in this Country
When I take my proper prosttrion and title. Having
therefore made up my mind to return and face the Sea
once more, I must request you to send me the Means of
doing so, and paying a fue outstanding debts, 1 would
return by the overland Mail. The passage money and
other expenees would be over two Hundred pound, for I
propose Sailing from Victoria, not this Colainly. And to
Sjil from Melbourne in my own name. Now to annable
me to do this, my dear Mother, you must send me
Again :
If to late i will send this to England has the English
mail does not close for two hours after the Mail for
France. I have enclosed a photograph of my self that
you may see how greatly I have improve. Hoping, my
dear mama, to see alive once more. But lam afraid not,
has I can not get suefioine Money to come home with.
Goody bye, my Dear Mama, and' MAY THE BLESSED
MARIA HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL.-I Remain,
your Affectionate Son, Roger Charles Tichborne.
When the poor old lady at last met her bulky
bogus son she declared that “ his face was like his
father’s, but he had ears like his uncle’s.”
Sydney Truth publishes (for the first time) an
interesting statement to the effect that it was the
unanimous judgment of the Australian lawyers
(including the clever Isaacs) engaged in diagnosing
the case, that the Claimant was not Arthur
Orton, but a natural son of the late Sir Thomas
Tichborne, his mother being one of the members
of the Orton family. This conclusion was based
on, among other things, his undoubted resem-
blance to both families, and his acquaintance with
their personal secrets.

ceive payment for bis ser-
vices was J. Hoskins, now
an M.L.C. He received a
liberal salary from the
Adelong miners when they
returned him to the As-
sembly, many years ago.
And yet tbe Council does
not contain a more garrul-
ous opponent of payment
of members than J. Hos-
kins, who, by the way, in
company with that other
self-sacrificinar patriot, J.
Davies, draws quite a very
respectable annual income
from tbe Public Works
Committee. Circumstances
alter cases, especially the
case of J. Hoskins.
Attorney - General
Isaacs threw some light
upon the anti - land 1 *- tax
agitation in Victoria when
he explained that G. G.
Morton, who presided over
the Ballarat Show banquet
and talked about the suf-
ferings of the poor fanner,
was Morton, the manager
of Bart. Clarke’s estate.
In fact, it was a case, as
Isaacs fairly observed, of
a great land prince’s am-
bassador pleading his mas-
ter’s cause before a Fat
Man audience. Every-
where the noisy opponents
of a land-tax are found to
be the same little cliques
that erstwhile represented
“ the voice of the country”
when they f6ted J. B.
Patterson, and who cer-
tainly don’t represent the
farmers who helped to turn
that scowling Tory out of
office.
N.S.W. Premier Reid is said to privately
exult at the public defection of B. R. Wise, as
thereby is dispelled the illusion that that young
champion of inconstancy plays prompter to the
Ministry.
The Mayor of Hamilton (Vic.) presided at
a meeting in favor of minimum wage. Then his
Council censured him. Whereupon the rate-
payers filled the town-hall and unanimously cen-
sured the Council.
The Argus, on Retrenchment, faintly re-
calls Stout, the Political Economist, in Bulwer’s
“Money.” “They give their Lord Chancellor
ten thousand a year, when I have a second-cousin
who will do it for a quarter of the sum.”
“ A Second Chamber acts as a drag. Pro-
gress is always uphill work. So we are at pains to
provide a drag beforehand —for an uphill journey.
There, in one word, you have the whole philo-
sophy of Second Chambers.’’—Grant Allen.
The pastoralists in Queensland are really
considering the question of a further re 1 notion in
shearers’ wages during next season. The Bush
Workers’Union is “on its uppers” financially,
and the squatters know their opportunity is a good
one.
Armidale (N.S.W.) Express calls upon
local “selectors and land-owners” to petition the
Legislative Council against the land-tax. No
need for such a waste of breath. As well petition
bookmakers to use their influence against the
tote.
Queensland Legislative Councillors
“ saved ” that province £6OOO by rejecting the
Payment of Members Bill, but cheerfully endorsed
the robbery of the country to the extent of £120,000
in stamp duties by the Reconstructed Companies
Bill.
The success of the Opposition to the
Kingston Gov. in S. A. is severely discounted by
the fact that every one of the disaffected poli-
ticians desires to be in the next Ministry. Solo
mon, Moule, and Hague all want the Treasurer-
ship.
Vic. Assembly has passed a tax on absentee
V ictorians, but does not penalise other absentee
landlords. It might drive away capital! Yet
even the akgus admits that an influx of British
capital into Australia has always been attended
by disaster.
It was left for an attorney, chiefly sup-
ported by a barrister, to pass Yic.’s most Demo-
cratic Bill (Land-Tax) through the Assembly.
Turner and Isaacs have succeeded in piecing
together a Liberal Ministry (so far as policy goes)
where Munro and Shiels and Berry failed.
Andrew Clarke offers to do Duncan Gillies’
work as Vic. Agent-General for rather less than
half the money. Consider the lengths to which
this may be carried. Lord Nozoo is ready to take
the Governorship for a tenth of Hopetoun’s wage.
Nay, Longtnore would replace Turner —and so on.
Vic. Labor members took the right side
in fighting for the veteran scientists Von Mueller
and Ellery. They also held out successfully for
an increase in the miserable Gov. pittance to the
Yic. artists. As far as Vie. Parliament is con-
cerned, Labor is distinctly hand in hand with art
and science.
The rival policies of retrenchment in the
S. A. Parliament lately have amounted to this.
The Labor party have determined that no one
drawing less than £2OO shall suffer. The Conser-
vatives have been specially interested to save men
with more than £6OO annually. The middle rank
has had no saviour.

BUSHMAN ( who has engaged barber to “take off a shilling’s-

BUSHMAN : “ Well, gimme the difference in tebacker; I ain't got
no money."
of Appropriation Bill, and that 13 voted against
18 when the clause was reintroduced, has made
superstitious members of that body nervous about
the immediate future.
In S. A. Assembly the other day, Solomon,
M.L. A., a man evidently created as a burlesque
on his own name, proposed that the trans-con-
tinental line should be completed on the land-
grant system. He was gloriously snuffed out by
25 to 12. Australia doesn’t want any more land-
grant swindle just now.
£1403 is the trifle of taxpayers’ coin
annually pouched by four members of one Sydney
family for services which wouldn’t in the aggre-
gate fetcli £5 a week in open commercial market.
One of the quartette takes nearly .£5OO a year for
doing literally nothing, and another <£B a week for
clerical work that would be well-paid at 30s.
Mrs. Ida Halloran, 8.A., seeks to invest
a constituency with the power of recalling, by a
majority vote equal to that which elected him, a
member of Parliament whom it has ceased to trust.
The only reason against-this is -thtl iateiHiiliable
agitation which such a power might engender.
Three years is certainly too long a tether to give
the average member.
Member Crick’s desire that, in the event of
the Privy Council being thrown open to “colonial”
judges, no Australian Judge who has not occupied
the bench for ten years shall be eligible for
appointment, directly disqualifies the three Chief
Justices, Darley, Madden and Griffith, and
narrows the choice down to almost a one-man
field.
Major-General Hutton (N.S.W.) put his
side of a contentious topic thus a few nights
ago:—“What do you want? You want your
men trained according to the best standards.
Well, am 1 to send the men to England to be
trained, or am I to bring from England trained
men to instruct those here? Which is the more
economical, the more patriotic? Which shows
the sounder Australian spirit?”
The Australasian declares hysterically
that nothing like Premier Turner's land-tax
scheme “ has been heard in English history since
Edward I. extorted treasure from the Jews by
pulling their teeth till they produced their last
penny.” The Tory rag has no sense of proportion,
and mistakes the very ordinary worm in its back-
yard for the sea-serpent, simply because it is its
own worm.
Dear Bulletin, —If Dan O’Connor, or any
other Irishman, had been N.S.W. Postmaster-
General and done the letter-trick (opening letters
suspected to contain gambling communications)
now going on in the province, hundreds of the
Cook ilk would see in it a Jesuitical plot to upset
the Constitution. I consider that when a man
stamps a letter and posts it, he has a right to
have it delivered.—English-Australian.
Abolish Hansard 1 Why, the daily press
not only prepares each its special party-mystery
stew of Parliamentary proceedings, but their
recording angels actually omit therefrom the
green fat and titbits that relieve the dreary
horrors of long sittings. To abolish Hansard
would be to destroy the only life-resembling photo-
graphs of the uncouth animals in the public
menagerie.
Premier Reid ukases that no strangers
are to be employed on the N.S.W. Public Works
contracts. By this rascally piece of Protectionism,
this restricting of the labor market, labor-rates
are to be advanced (or, what is the same thing,
prevented from falling), and the poor suffering
country deprived of the advantages obtainable
from free-competition and the unfettered operation
of the sacred laws of supply and demand.
The repeated public statements of N.S.W.
Ministers Gould and Reid, asserting in effect that
only for the obstinate hostility of Justice Win-
deyer directions would be given for the release of
Francis Abigail, are unfavorably commented on in
judicial circles. It is held to be impolitic for a
Government to express sympathy in one direction
and focus public attention on a particular person
as the cause of a contrary course of action.
“Figs from thistles!” Sydney M.L.C.
(loq.): “I hear a great deal in connection with
tlie_ Labor-party, about class-interests and class-
legislation, but when I look round our own
Chamber, I can’t help seeing that we have amongst
us exactly the same thing, in even more aggra-
vated form —the blind and stubborn cl;i a s-intereBt
of a lot of old-buffers who have made a bit of
money, and have nothing but that money to re-
commend them!”
Sydney D.T. deliberately admits that
“the unwise stimulus ” which an import duty on
grain “ gives to production soon brings down the
price obtainable in the local market.” Wha-a t !
The “cheap food ” D.T. among the very prophets
it has been trying to behead ! Where now is its
cry that Protection increases prices to the con-
sumer ? Where now its blubbering pathos about
a tax on stomachs ? “ Protection cheapens prices ”
is a new free-raid song indeed.
Now that N.S.W. Railway Commissioner
Eddy is about to retire there are hints that ex-
Commissioner Goodchap would like to bob up
serenely from below. Mr. Goodchap was a good
man who never had Mr. Eddy’s chances. But he
is not so young as he was. He has, to his friends’
delight, recovered from a terrible illness, and he
has a nice pension of £B6O a year. If he is a wise
man, he «ill stick to it. Only men who want to
die soon take N.S.W, Chief-Commissionerships of
Railways.
Queensland Attorney - General Byrnes,
orating to a Sydney interviewer, declares that,

ently satisfactory in Queensland. The equilibrium

Dear Bulletin, —To compel landowners
to make their own valuations for land-tax does
not wholly abolish land-resumption “makes.” A
man I knew owned an estate in Maoriland. He
put it in an agent’s hands for sale at £3500.
Hearing that the place would be required for a
battery-site, at the next property-tax valuation he
valued it at £19,000, which the Govt, assessor
accepted with delight. When the resumption
took place the Govt, was presented with the
valuation which their own officers had accepted.
The owner got £lB,OOO, or thereabouts.— Maori

there had been no land-tax valuation. —Ed. B.]

Gov. Kinfcore, who departs in a few weeks,
has privately stated that he leaves S. A. with
about .£5OOO profit on his four years' stay. It is
Certainly a small sum, considering that during
the last two years Govt. House has been virtually
closed to all but intimates, and such a thing as a
vice-regal ball has not been witnessed since Lady
Kintore fled to England.

Suffrage Act :
Recognising the solemn responsibility of this added
power, we ask Him—if Her Majesty's assent be given to

and in the interests of His kingdom.
Apparently the Almighty comes after “ Her

The “open sesame” to the N.S. W. Civil
Service is, notwithstanding the alleged competitive-
examination test, the “crimson thread of kinship”
with an M.P., or an M. P.’s jackal. The pass-
word to promotion is in the nature of the answer
that can be made to either of the questions —“How
old is your mother?” “How old is your grand-
mother?’’ In N.S.W., the Masonic phrase, “ the
Great Architect of the Universe,’’ might advan-
tageously be made interchangeable witli “the
Great Architect of the Civil Service.” It is the
same blend of Joss.
# # #
A N.S.W. civil servant —a 400-pounder—
complained to a friend that the numerous “mathe-
matical calculations” occurring in his daily official
duties frequently floored him. “As how?”
“Here’s a question now —‘If a man gives £430
for a piece of land, how much should he give for
half of it ?’ How is a fellah, who isn’t a mathe-
matical fellah, don’tcherknow, to work out that
sort of a problem ?”

A Yic. civil servant turned up at his
office on the first of the Xmas holidays, and com-

business man whose temper and pocket alike
revolt at the idea of compulsory holiday-making.

give pledges enjoining abstinence from special

every kind of drink that he doesn’t care for.

A well-known Southern lawyer received
instructions to issue a writ against a debtor at the
expiration of three days—the term of
notice. Before the time expired, the
debtor paid the claim to the creditor,
and as no process had been issued,
rightly declined to pay “costs.” The
creditor telephoned the result to the
lawyer, who next day billed him
thusly : “To attending you at tele-
phone re , 10s. 6d.”
An almost incredible fact.

Dear Bulletin, —In view of the recent
disclosures bearing upon Mrs. Mellon’s method of
raising the spirits of the departed, the Rev. Geo.
Walters, of Sydney, should be requested to repeat
his Melb. lecture of a few months back, in which
he posed as a believer, and declared enthusiasti-
cally that he had been kissed by “ the little fat

* * *
Dear Bulletin,— My sympathy writhes
at the news that Mrs. Mellon, the spook-trainer,
is “ dwindling away.” I am the more horrified,
as my heart went out towards her directly I read
that she once remarked, “You know how skinny I
am,” or words to that effect. The admission per-
plexed me, for all the lady-mediums 1 have seen,
from Mrs. Hardinge-Britten to Mrs. Evans (and I
have seen a few), have been “fine,” taking,
forceful, rounded women—magnetic to the male
eye which loves its pound of flesh. It is the
contour that hypnotises bold, bad man. Who
would give a fig to see a skeleton in a heaving fit ?
Not I, i’faith. Plumpness in distress, juiciness in
the wobbling throes of going-offness, massive
beauty in dishevelled perturbation, six-inch-deep
firmness evolving a hollow voice and an epileptic
madness of vision—this, ah ! this is the real
spookiness with its hair down ! You feel it.
You breathe it. It is not contagious, nor
infectious, but it is worth your money.
You can believe anything with the miraculous
vision before you. This is bang-up science. But,
of course, it has its irritating counterblast. Every
male “ meejum ” that I have had the honor of
believing to be a fraud has been a skinny, angular
man, a brassy, flashy individual sometimes, or a
silken-voiced reptile that smelt snaky all the time.
Uobbiys, when 1 patronised him, had red hair !
Most of the male spook-finders revel in black.
But they all run greatly to hair —like professional
mesmerists. Evans (the slate-writer) had a cast
in his eye. Is my experience the experience
generally of others? — The Dipsomaniac.

at St. Stephen’s, South Kensington, to Mr.
William Cunliffe Pickersgill Jay, son of Mr. Carl
Jay, of 34 Q.men’s Gate Gardens, London, and
Blendon Hall, Bexley, on 14th Nov. The bride,
who lacks the intense gang froid of her father, was
excessively nervous, and spoke so low that people
asked if she had fainted; but she looked charm-
ingly pretty in white satin trimmed with lace,
and the usual accessories. There were four brides-
maids—Miss Skarratt, Miss Muriel Pilcher, Miss
Fraser and Miss ,1 iy —who wore remarkably ugly
dressos of so ue brown stuff, trimmed with beaver,
white waist bands and red throat bands. Brown
hats trimmed with beaver and brims lined with
red ribbon formed the head-gear. They carried
foliage bouquets tied with bright red ribbon. The
church was crowded, many Australians being
present, of course. R“cepti >n at 147 Queen’s

Apropos of certain Xmas meals given to
tne poor of charitable institutions, how it must
harrow the souls of the noble-minded and generous
people chiefly instrumental in providing these
leasts to find their names remorselessly blazoned
forth in the public prints! “The meat was all
provided by Mr. and Mrs. So-and-50,”—50 joints
to (say) the Lepers’ Home, 90 joints to the Dorcas
Corroboree Society, and so on. To see thus
advertised the good deeds done privately, and
out of sheer benevolence, is enough to make
the modest and unselfish people, who thus endea-
vour to brighten the Xmas of the afflicted, die of
sheer squirm. The Bulletin sympathises from
the bottom of its liver with the affronted philan-
thropists, and trusts that on future occasions they
will be successful in their endeavours to evade the

The melancholy suicide in England of Mr.
Lloyd Burdekin, medical student, eldest son of
Mr. and Mrs. Sydney Burdekin, has caused wide-
spread sympathy in Sydney, where Mr. Burdekin,
sen., is known as the best and most generous of
Australian landlords—he has never enforced a
distress-warrant or “raised the rent ” on an old
tenant—and Mrs. Burdekin as one of the most
charming of Australia’s daughters. The afflicted
parents can only take consolation in the fact that
their unfortunate son’s death, though it _ came
about by his own hand, was just as much in the
course of nature as if lie had died from fever : for
the letters he left behind show clearly—despite
the old and unscientific law still maintained by
the State, in defiance of all the teachings of
nlienistic experience—that a man may know the
inference between right and wrong and still be
utterly powerless to do what is right.

it that man, when he

than usually impres-
sive, always gets into
skirts ? Surplices, bar-
risters’ and judges’
gowns, the Speaker’s
robe, the glaring mil-
linery worn by kings
on Coronation-day, the
millinery of lord chan-
cellors, bishops, car-
dinals, popes, and other
large dignitaries, are
all evidences of man’s
hunger to get into pet-
ticoats.

“My father was

This is the answer
which a certain high-up
civil servant now makes
to departmental chiefs
who threaten him.
Those words imply,
“Sir, all letters written
to my father, and
marked private, he
kept, and they are now
in my possession ; more-
over, sir, all private
letters which my father
wrote, he kept a copy of; these copies also 1 keep

In artist Peel’s pupils’ exhibition (Melb.)
for tills year (a most creditable all-round show, by
the way) there is a river sunset picture, decidedly
happy in coloring and freshness. It is the
work of a lady, 84 years of age, who, until
the last twelve months, had never handled a
brush. Besides this phenomenal old lady, there
are two other “juvenile” lady pupils who can
both count 70 summers, and who have also done
excellent work.

The average Marine Board resembles
nothing so much as a reversal of the temperance
chart illustrating the pulse of a moderate drinker.
Just after a big wreck it is so oppressively vir-
tuous and prudish that for a captain to misplace a
fender when pulling into a wharf means an 18
months’ suspension tor a certainty. Three weeks
later the same mistake probably calls for a fine,
and after two months the heinous crime dwindles
to the proportions of a plate broken by the China*

Dear Bulletin,— The Australian Institute
of Journalists in Melbourne, were it only game,
would subject the literary civil servant to some-
thing lingering and humorous with boiling oil in
it. It is the man who holds a comparatively fat
and comfortable billet in “the service” who looks
up local editors with offers to do this or that
special work —sporting, etc.—mainly for honor
and glory; payment no consideration, don’t you
know. As payment is a very great consideration
with most proprietors, he usually gets the work,
and is satisfied with a little cash, and whatever
kudos is derivable from his position as So-and-so
of the Blunderer, or the Weekly Wail, and the
poor reporter turns bootblack or goes village-
settling. When the democracy sees the equity of
one-man-one-billet, newspapers will not enjoy the
advantages of this State-subsidy.—S.S.

be in a council. She should be in a circus, at

Henry Lawson: An Australian Poet.
Henry Lawson’s friends will be interested to hear
that his first volume of collected work is pub-
lished. It is a poor little, badly-printed volume,
and contains only a dozen or so examples of the
writer’s skill in verse and prose (and those not all
of his best); but every Australian should invest a
shilling in a copy—firstly, because the book is
well worth it; secondly, because it is a charac-
teristically Australian book, one of the few really
original attempts towards an Australian litera-
ture; and, thirdly, because the author will be
thereby encouraged to produce a bigger volume in
better form—a form more worthy of his genius.
For Henry Lawson has a real streak of genius
perhaps, as poet and story-teller united, a
more luminous streak than any other man
in Australasia. The Bulletin knows plenty
of clever writers, but it dues not know another
than Lawson who could write the sketch called
“The Drover’s Wife,” which takes up twelve
pages in the badly-printed little book. You can
ransack the whole realm of Australian prose with-
out finding a mate for that sketch, brim-full of
the humor and pathos of the bush.
# * *
Henry Archibald Lawson was born on the Wed-
din Mountain diggings, near Grenfell, N.S.W., on
17 June, 1867. His father was Peter Hertzberg
Larsen, a Norwegian; his mother, Louisa Albury,a
nativeof Guntawattg, near Mud gee, N.S.W. Thus
Lawson’s name is really Larsen ; bub the Angli-
cised form appears to have been nearly always
used by his fattier, who is “ Peter Larsen ” in his
marriage certificate, but Peter Archibald Law-
son ”in Henry’s birth certificate. -I he Archi-
bald ” is an unlucky and somewhat humorous
misunderstanding on the part of the minister who
officiated at the christening, and who, being rather
deaf, mistook “ Hertzberg ” for “Archibald, and
sent the young Australian author through the
world with an English instead of a Norse middle-
name, much to his father’s disgust.
» • •
| JHenry Lawson’s father was the son of a Norsk
teacher of navigation, and a clever man with
brain and hand. His mother, Mrs. Louisa
Lawson, is still living, and is well-known in
Sydney as a speaker and writer, being proprietress
of the woman’s paper, Dawn. Henry Lawson
much resembles his mother, from whom he in-
herits many of bis mental traits. His maternal
grandfather is a fine specimen of the old Kentish
yeoman, a “powerful uncultured man,” and bis
mother has been “in love with poetry” since
childhood. It cannot be doubted that her dreams
and aspirations have largely influenced her eldest
son.
* * *
At the time of young Lawson’s birth his father
was a miner, but when be was a few months old his
parents took a farm at Wilbertree, near Mudgee,
N.S.W. His father gradually drifted into con-
tracting, and in helping him and assisting on the
farm, with occasional trips round the country,
Henry acquired the beginnings of his intimate
knowledge of life “out back.” When be was
17, he came with bis mother to Sydney,
where he learnt the trade of a coach-painter. His
first published composition was “The Song of the
Republic,” contributed to The Bulletin in 1888;
and since then his pen has never been idle.
years ago, on tlio death of his Henry and
his brother, a promising young musician, went to
Westralia, and later he was for a short time on
the staff of the defunct Queensland Boomerang.
He has also travelled in Victoria and Maoriland,
following his trade as a painter and writing verses.
« * #
In person Henry Lawson is slight, but tall and
muscular, with prominent features and large,
eloquent brown eyes. He suffers from deafness,
the result of an attack of fever in boyhood. Of
the merit of his writings there can be no question.
Henry Lawson is the voice of the bush, and the
bush is the heart of Australia. He has its mirth
and melancholy, and commands at will laughter
and tears. He is a keen observer; he has a fine
imagination; he is a born poet, dowered with the
poet’s passion and sympathy. He lacks culture
and critical insight, his sense of form is crude; but
these things may come to him, for he is young-
only 27 —and his work grows steadily better as he
matures. Yet Art can never give him a tithe of
the charm which he holds in direct fee-simple from
Nature.

enterprise.

“ Nuggets in the Devil’s Punchbowl,” by
Andrew Robertson (sent to The Bulletin by-

mine illuminated by the words of the 91st Psalm.
There are also a bushranger, a snake-bite, and a-

unconscious joke, which describes the police who
may be spotted anywhere by their rig as “a uni-
form failure.” There is nothing immoral about,
the book, anyway.
Editor Bulletin, —These incidents in the
life of the Rev. C. F. Garnsey, of Sydney, lately
deceased, will at least show that some parsons try
to practise what they preach. About the year ’73
the most virulent form of scarlet fever became
epidemic in Windsor (N.S. W.). Of one family
six members were attacked, and no one would go>
near the house save the doctor and Mr. Garnsey,
their parish clergyman, who at once installed him-
self as helper. Four died within three days, amt
the good parson performed the last offices for tins
dead in each case. The two who recovered —the*
present writer is one—owe their lives to his care.
Late one afternoon a boy, son of a police constable-
in Windsor (not of Mr. Garnsey’s creed)-,,
was drowned while bathing at the junction of the-
South Creek with the Hawkesbury. Mr. Garnsey
heard of this on returning home about 11 p. in. and
ascertained that the body had not been recovered.
At once he set out alone for the spot and about
midnight stripped and dived in to try and find d.
After some time he struck against it, lying at Un-
bottom of the river. Mr. Garnsey’s strongest point
w as his influence with men. He had seen many
sides of life. He had done hard, manual work ;
had managed a sheep-run in Tasmania wit.,
assigned servants under him ; he was a fine ridei,
and at one time a good cricketer. All men worthy
of the name who met him recognised in him tl.n
true grit.—A. J.

January 1, 1895.
Mv Dear Moorabinda—
I saw the serpentining Earl of Yarmouth as he
was being towed round Sydney the other day.
Without his blonde curls and ruddy rouge,
Viscount Heel and Toe somewhat resembles a
ripe peach—he is so pink and downy-looking. No
wonder he th'ougbt of framing himself in a girl’s
wig, for his is the kind of visage that looks lonely
without a butterfly bang. But it would really
need a very Sherlock Holines to spot him for a
terpsichorean. His flat - fopted, seven - league
British stride betrays none of the thistle-down
lightness that should belong even to the every-
day amble of premiere danseuse.
I have not yet seen the distinguished visitor in
his favorit - rdle of teetotum and his wonderful
lace-petticoats. When I did view him he was
simply attired in a baggy suit of tweeds with a
pale-blue necktie : also a crutch-handle stick and
a silver cigarette case as large as a slice off a tin-
loaf.
A Melbourne matron perpetrated the horrible
mistake of is-uing pasteboards for a dance in the
fag-end of November, “to meet the Viscount.”
And when the short, pink E trl refused to be joss
on the occasion, and declined the invitation, the
lady calmly “postponed” the flare-up—presum-
ably until the Earl should change his mind.
An Australian belle who married into the
nobility has had, so goes the tale, a parlous bad
time with her relafcions-iu-law. Instead of the
marble halls in which her friends framed her in
their dreams, her domicile was a tumble-down
little shanty far from the Moated Grange, and the
contumelious treatment she received at the hands
of her husband’s relatives was quite up to Cin-
derella stan lards. Now, however, the air has
cleared. Thugs have happened—that Australian
girl’s turn has come, and woe to her patrician
connections!
A, ropos of snei d give-and-take, a most charac-
e istic story is going the rounds re an Australian
e .-Premier, whose legal pansy-blossom is, for
•-(line unknown reason, not on sisterly terms with
certain vice regalities. When some frisky society
maidens imbibed not wisely but too well at Guv-
mentouse, the Governor of the day fled next
morning in great disorder to recount the whole
adventure to the politician who, as a patriarch of
the province, might be relied upon to know the
ropes. “Tell me, is this sort of thing usual at
Government House?” gasped the horrified poten-
tate. “Ho yes, Hi believe so,” at once answered
the statesman in his inimitably languid style,
“and that’s just why Hi never let Lady X go.”
“ By the way, I want to speak to you on that very
subject,” began the Governor, lamely, but here
the Great Opportunist drew himself up in all his
majesty. “Not one word, your Hexellency,”
said he, in a commanding squeak, “Lady Hex
could nevah be hinduced to visit hat Government
’Ouse.” It was indeed a noble instance of presence
of mind.
There was no V.R. patronage for the last Sydney
Liedertafel concert of the season. In Melbourne,
Gov. ’Opetoun has a deep-rooted objection to the
little band of dress-suits who upend themselves in
the Town Hall to warble about the flow’rets
closing at eve, and so on. Lord H. only patron-
ises them in his hair-shirt moments, so to
speak. Indeed, His Victorian Ex. openly declares
(more openly than ever, now that his barque is on
the seafthat if he had any real power he would
issue a ukase making persistent Liedertafel singing
an indictable offence.
Fisk’s Jubilee Minstrels, under the guidance of
organ-voiced Mr. Orpheus M‘Adoo, made a cheer-
ful re appearance at Sydney Centenary on Boxing
Night, and had to sing a double programme
owing to the pressure of encores. Encoring isn’t
a feminine vice, and women don’t applaud with
their feet. I have only known one woman (I am,
of course, speaking in a strictly dress-circle sense)
to do so, and the vigor with which she stamped
after every item provoked much astonishment.
“I am glad to see,” said someone, “that you are
not too English to show your pleasure.” “Oh,
that’s not the reason,” replied she, with her two
knees going like churn-sticks. “My feet are so
wet, yon know, and I must keep the blood circu-
lating !”
But the M'Adoo minstrels warble with so much
natural fervor that it certainly is difficult to
refrain from provoking them into doing it all over
again. Time, apparently, has no effect on the
robust tenor of Miss Mattie Allen —the rare bird
of the show—or on M’Adoo’s soothing and pro-
found bass, which he apparently produces from
his boots. Then there is a lady who would make
a barrel of tar look pale, and who possesses a
dramatic soprano voice of bell-like quality ; with
a quadroon mezzo-soprano and an upright he-
tenor, who all help to make the jubilee choruses
the attraction they undoubtedly are. It was a
clever idea, too, I thought, for the ladies to all
wear black gowns, which gave their —er —sunburnt
complexions every chance.
I am in receipt of the “ Grace ” waltz, by Sydney
Turnbull, of Bananaland, who has dedicated his
by no means commonplace little effort to Lady
Norman, altho’ Her Northern Ex. isn’t exactly
the sort of lady one would accuse of a leaning to
the light fantastic toe. But ambitious compos ra
never stop to consider the fitness of things. An
Australian M.P., whose gout was (and is, I ex-
pect) simply horrid, once had a hopping schottishe
dedicated to him by a thoughtless lady friend, and
I shan’t be a bit astonished when somebody
inscribes a rowdy comic song to the honor and
glory of Primate Smith or Cardinal Moran.
“ The Grace ” waltz is a prettily tuneful,
smooth and eminently danceable measure, and
quite deserves the triumphal sale it is alleged to
nave achieved in Brisbane. From Mr. Percy
Abbott comes a copy of “ My Lad,” a sailor song
without a shipwrecked corpse, which is alone
sufficient to ensure its popularity. Further
advantages are a waltz-refrain and a photo, of
Mr. Abbott (singer and composer) on the cover.
“ My Lad ” is catchy and ought to be popular—if
only because it isn’t dedicated to a duke. By the
way, I wish the publishers of these bursts of
heavenly harmony would put a little more starch
in the paper they print them on. None of the
home-grown sheet-music can stand on its hind
legs on the music-rest.
One of the things that took my fancy in “ The
House that Jack Built’’—the pantomime at Her
Majesty’s—was the fact (made evident by the
attire of Dame Trot) that women aren’t accumu-
lating many new vanities as they stagger down
the ages. I call it a distinctly encouraging thing
when the comic she-man has to reach over to the
tie-back skirt period in order to satirise feminine
fashions, and the serio-comique is forced to allude
to the long-abjured bustle. It looks as if the latter-
day female doesn’t intend to look as much of a
fool as she used to —though Fred Dark (Mother
Hubbard) in the second act, as an “Advanced
Woman ” in full tartan knickers and a butterfly
bonnet, pretty well pillories all the feminine
eccentricities that threaten to keep male creation
on the broad grin before very long.
Miss Florence Esdaile (late of the Royal Comic
Opera Co.) as the Princess, wears two breezy
toilets, and that's not counting the cabbage-green
satin, criss-crossed with black, worn in the first
act, that blends so charmingly with “Jack’s”
pale heliotrope suiting. In net 2 she wears a
Nautch drapery of pale pink strips of satin with a
plethora of barbaric ornaments, but she commits
the mistake of wearing corsets, which spoils the
true inwardness of the thrilling pink singlet made
familiar to ns by Nellie Stewart. The end and
aim of the Nautch costume is to suggest that the
lady (in a state of nature) has jus . thrown a few
sequins at herself and trusted to them sticking
where they were most needed, so the bare sus-
picion of whalebone spoils the picture, as it were.
Miss Esdaile’s wedding-toilet, of white and silver,
was an elegant fancy dress, especially when
backed up by the fetching Flo. Forde, as “Jack,”
in pale moonstone-colored satin, with long cloak
of wattle-color and three yellow plurne,s in her
knave-shaped hat. Miss Forde’s long heliotrope
tights are also visions of loveliness, but I didn’t
admire her get-up of carubia red and yellow—it
was too reminiscent of fat beef.
They are not exactly over-dressed in “Jack.”
Take that fetching cocoa-coloured “ boy,” with the
statuesque limbs, who stands on the o.p. side, par
exemple. She is simply and radiantly attired in
a suit of brown fleshings cap-a-pie, with a yard or
so of gaily-striped satin judiciously draped and
trickily finished off with a few golden spangles
which add tons to the attractiveness of a singularly
fetching costume. Perhaps the most artistic item
in a rather gorgeous show was when the witches,
transformed into rose-pink fays, seasonably attired
in one layer of chiffon, danced a measure among
flames of fire. It had a most weird look, and 1
only hope none of the infants gazing with goggle-
eyed astonishment will strive to emulate the flame-
effects in the kitchen when the authority has her
back turned.
Ths last (Summer Cup) day of the A. J.C. two
days’ flutter at Rand wick was not exactly a
fashionable fixture—the attendance on the Mem-
bers’ being a mere sprinkle. Also, the Governor’s
box was a howding Sahara, and afternoon-tea in
the carriage-paddock was a vain thing. It was a
cold day indeed for notabilities. The departing
Admiral with his daughter, Miss Mildred Bowdeii-
Smith, in her Melbourne Cup frock, wandered on
the lawn in lonely state, deserted even by the
usual suite.
Quite the feature of the tobacco-scented end of
the lawn (for he never strayed as far as the Mem-
bers’) was the young millionaire, heir to the huge
fortune of a deceased English cotton spinner,
and at present living en prince at a big Sydney
hotel. He is said to choose his chums on the most
radical principles, and to find more joy hunting
bugs and butterflies than in p wading toe haunts
of fashionable belledom. The gilded traveller is
a tall and strapping over-six-foot blonde.
Buf I haven’t finished talking about the Summer
Cup. A lady of a legal family, in a stylish white
gown striped with cosmea pink, full pink satin
sleeves covered with white chiffon, and a white
chiffon parasol, looked smart enough for a garden-
party, but it wasn’t a fashionable crowd, and the
feminine interest was as weak as water. Tne
oddest girl I saw on the members’ stand wore a
lilac-striped print with a thing like a horse’s-collar
of stiff white linen with an edge of embroidery -
deep cuffs to the elbow en suite. Any youth who
pressed that get-up to his manly bosom would feel
as if he were hugging Joan of Arc with her fight-
ing clothes on.
Apropos of cricket, the sad end of Mr. Lloyd
Burdekin, eldest son of Mr. Sydney Burdekin,
who shot himself in England recently, is now said
to have been due to the defeat of the Australians
in the recent test cricket-match, England versus
Australia. It is said that the unfortunate young
fellow laid plunging - odds" on the Australians
winning the game, and the news of their defeat
was probably too much for his misguided sense of
patriotism, even if not for his pocket.
Sydney Royal was simply crowded out on
Saturday night, when the ever-popular Bland
Holt continued his wild career (begun on Boxing
Night) with a drama of the most Blandholtian
dye, yclept “The Span of Life.” Though
Walter Baker (who appeared to sport three gold
brooches in his black cummerbund) was the con-
ventional hero, the whole audience seemed to
consider that Mr. Holt, as the versatile “Nutty,”
was the principal male character, and cheered
accordingly. Pretty Hilda Spong played the rdle
of heroine in an angelic sort of white gown, with
long fichu of frilly wh'te chiffon; a Nancy Lee
kind of white dress with blue collars ; and a brown
garment and widow’s weeds, in which Miss S,
looked so fetching that a hero of any artistic
discernment would never have dreamt of turning
up alive again and spoiling so eminently becoming
a costume.
Lively Mrs. Bland Holt, who is never so wel-
come as in a strong comedy part, never missed a
point in the Malapropish dialogue of the servant-
girl ShroveTuesday, and waswarrnlyreceivedby the
gallery—the tribunal whereby most professionals
stand or fall. Shrove isn’t as dressy as a milliner’s
dummy, but dressing isn’t the strong point of the
“ Span of Life,” which relies on a chain of hair-
curling sensations to keep people clamoring for the
right to hang by their eyebrows in the auditorium.
What I like about Mr. Holt’s scrupulously-staged
productions (any number of horses and a camel
figure in “ The Span of Life ”) is that they play
with such dead earnestness that they always look
as probabl ■as the Ten Commandments. And I
think the villain in “ The Span of Life ” (played
by Mr. Cosgrove) is the most realistic villain I
have ever met—knowingly, at least.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

Dear Bulletin, —The £5OO exemption-
clause in Vic. Land-Tax Bill was simply a des-
perate Tory trick, accomplished with the aid of
bogus Liberals in the teeth of honest Radical
opposition. The exemption was intended to give
the Legislative Council a ghost of an excuse for
rejecting, the Bill, and its immediate resultr,
clearly foreseen, was Sargood’s retirement from
the Ministry. Wrote Sargood to Premier Turner :
“I strongly deprecated this alteration, as you will
remember, seeing that, while it relieved 160,000
persons from a very small tax, it threw this extra
burden upon the shoulders of a comparative few.’’
There was the softgoods-importbr’s excuse for
going over boldly to the enemy. You suggest in
your article that the aforesaid 160,000 small land-
owners might have kicked against the tax. It was
not until the large men had abandoned all hope of
sympathy from the little men that they decided
to incite the cry of “unfair legislation ” by voting
for the £5OO clause. The extremest Tories in
the House subsequently had the hardihood to
attempt an increase of the exemption to £750.
That gave the game away.—Yours, Enquirer.
What is termed by the daily papers the
“Outrage at Coombing Park station” has been
the principal excitement of the past week. Ac-
cording to the story, Bertie Pulsford, son of the
great N.S.W. Foreign-trade panjandrum, was a
night-watchman at Coombing Park, when the
premises took fire, and two men—assumed to be
the usual wicked unionists —were seen running
away. Then Mr. Pulsford gallantly rushed after
them and fired at them, whereupon one of the
pair “turned round, aimed ‘deliberately ’ at the
gallant watchman with a revolver, and shot him
through the thigh.” This story rests chiefly upon
Pulsford’s own evidence, and, in the meantime,
the police have failed to find the two men, and
even suggest the theory that Pulsford wasn’t
“deliberately” shot at by anyone, but that his
own revolver went off in his pocket, and that he
is laboring under a mistake. The S.M. Herald,
in an inconsequent sort of fashion, adds the
following rather confused narrative to the present
story ;
This is not the first occasion on which Mr. Bertie Puls-
ford has shown pluck and determination in dealing with
d mgerous men. Some time ago, at the same place, Mr.
Bertie Pulsford faced a gang of 50 men who attempted to
foree their way into a shed in which free laborers were
sleeping. With a companion he charged the company
and rode right through them. He then heard a shot fired
some distance away, and, leaving his comrades to guard
the door of the shed, when in the direction of the report,
he ran as fast as he could, and suddenly found, iff the
dark, that a man had levelled a gun at him. Presenting
his revolver, he called upon the man to stand, and the
welcome and unexpected reply showed that it was Mr.
Withers, the manager of the station, with whom in the
darkness he h id hv a timely call escaped coming into an
unfortunate conflict.
According to this narrative Mr. Pulsford, on a pre-
vious occasion, rode right through 50 “ dangerous”
men who, to all appearance, made no attempt to
interfere with him. and then scooted into the dim
distance to attack his own colleague who was
firing promiscuously in the background. The
fact that the only man he seems to have attacked
on this occasion was his own boss suggests that
he is a somewhat hurried young man liable
for making mistakes when he rushes around in
the dark, and, therefore, it might be as well to
suspend judgment in the present instance until
further evidence comes to hand. A flurried youth
who is tearing around at night on a plain often
doesn’t really know who or what him, or
whether he was chasing a unionist or a station
r on.
SPOUTING NOTIONS.
Melbourne’s evening paper tried hard to boom
Howell’s bowling in the Vic.—N.S. W. match. One among
several pars., concerning the new man, announced that —
“ Howell’s performance against the Victorians, thus far,
reads 2 wickets for 26 runs 1” Which was not at all
remarkable, considering that 9 wickets for 130 had fallen
at time of writing. When the bowling averages for both
innings of Victoria came to be made up Howell was
fourth on the list. Turner and Callaway did as much, or
more, execution at considerably less expense, while
Newell’s average for two wickets was fractionally better
than “ the demon's."
* * * •
An odour of gate-money pervaded the inter
provincial match at Melbourne. Play didn’t start until
2 o’clock on the Saturday and Monday, in order that
there might be plenty of match left to attract a big
Boxing Day crowd. The policy was a comparative failure.
Long ere closing-time on the first day 9 Victorians were
out for 130, and when the last wicket was found to be
giving a lot of trouble the public had an excuse for
sniffing at such an odd circumstance. A game that com-
mences with the avowed purpose of carrying its interest
up to a given period is not a genuine sporting affair,
anyhow. Cricket-watchers said so by stopping away
from the M.C.O. ground in considerable numbers when
Boxing Day arrived.
* * * •
Enthusiastic South Australians think they
could put a champion province-team into the field with-
out including Lyons or George Giffen.
• • • •
One noted bowler, when “on the job,’’ is a
study in flesh. In running, the lower part of his dia-
phragm wobbles. To render himself bendable without
danger to himself or spectators, he coaxes aside with his
left hand the masskcontainiug his centre of gravity, and
picks up the ball with the right.
* * • •
S.A. admirers of Geo. Giffen, who thinks that
he and not Gregory should have received the money-gift
for batting in the Sydney match against Stoddart’s
eleven, are now collecting to give him something worthy
of his services to Australian cricket.
• * * *
Dear Bulletin, —In last week’s paper you state
that young Trumper, the N.S.W. boy-bat, who has been
playing such excellent cricket of late, is a pupil teacher at
Crown-street (Sydney) Public-school. In this you are
wrong. He is still a pupil and is captain of the school
team, having for his vice-captain Laurie Deane, brother of
the well-known players, Messrs. Syd. and Arthur Deane,
and himself a player of no mean repute. It is a coincidence
that Noble, who scored 152 (not out) against the English-
men, formerly occupied the position of captain of the
same school team. The school possesses an excellent
record, not having been beaten in school matches for 10
years.—Alpha.
♦ • • •
When Stoddart was not out for 151 on Monday
his average for all matches was 52.12 —740 for 14 com
pleted innings. Ward’s average was 49.10.

It is said that the English professionals, for
winning the first test-match, were rewarded by Maryle-
bone Club with £5OO.

Most of the English batsmen say the same thing
of Australian fieldsmen that most Australian batsmen say
of the English : “ I’ve no luck —the first chance I give it’s
snapped up all right.”

Suggestion to Blaokham : To play the English-
men, put into the next Australian team C. Bannerman,
Ned Gregory, and Dave Gregory. These were all excel-
lent men once.
* * * *
Each of the English pro.’s took away a lump
of the Sydney putty wicket which so largely contributed
to their first international win. They are sending ’Ome
bits of it to be placed under glass cases in the various
county cricket pavilions.

Dear Bulletin, —I saw the ladies’cricket-match
at Bathurst, on Boxing Day, and it really wasn’t half
bad. The fielding was the weakest feature, for the dear
girls wouldn’t back up. The batting was capital, the
Misses Gregory rattling up over a hundred between them
in no time. I expected underhand bowling, and was
agreeably surprised to find it the exception. A Miss
Keene took the bowling honors with a capital delivery,
moderately fast and with a decided break!!! What do
you think of that? But the dressing (ordinary length of
skirt) was all wrong, and until it is improved on ladies’
cricket won’t gee. The skirt, if the wind is kind io
the batswoman, blows in front of the wicket and mak s
an effectual shield. One lady was given out leg before
wicket, and I trembled for the umpire. To sum up, no
girl should play after she is 20 at the most, for when that
age is reached they don’t like sacrificing dignity for
speed. Tne younger girls all through the match were the
best players, always, of course, excepting the Misses
Gregory, who are “to the manner born.”—Yours, C.E.H.
* * * *
Victorians are not too well satisfied with their
representatives in the second test-match. Blackham,
who represents the province on the selection committee,
is captain of the Melb. team, and it is singular that of the
three men picked from Victoria two are always from the
Melb. team. This time Bruce, H. Trott, and Trumble are
picked, and Bruce and Trumble are Melb. men. Neither
of them has exhibited form this season, and yet they go in
instead of men like Worrall, Harry, or A. E. Trott.
Worrall, who made 96 against N.S.W. on a bad wicket, L
a splendid field and a good change bowler, whilst both
Harry and A. E. Trott have shown well this year.
« * * ♦
The board behind the wicket nearest the
entrance-gates of Sydney Cricket-ground is located some
feet within the play, and much interferes with the move-
ments of the nearest fieldsman. Ward was several times
baulked by it, and one catch he would assuredly have
held had it not been for the thing necessitating his stop’
ping when running at full speed.

Blarneystone’s Summer Cup win was greatly
due to the judgment displayed by jockey Tierney. Mar-
vel’s full brother had a year and a pound the advantage
of the Trier, who ran a good race, but there were a couple
in the ruck who might have been more prominent had
their people so ordained. The winner was backed at from
12 to 20 to 1.

J. D. Lewis, owner of Tarcoola, has bought
Bruin (who ran second in Caulfield and fourth in Melb.
Cup) with the intention of taking him to ’Frisco. Judging
from the success of second-rate Australian horses in
America, Bruin (whose best distance is six furlongs) ought
to more than pay his way, as the majority of the big
Yankee prizes are given in sprint races.

Dear Bulletin, — As it is impossible to repress
gambling, why not regulate it by making bookmaking a
misdemeanour, having totalisators worked by Govt, officials
at every race-meeting (only), the Govt, to take 5 per
cent, and the club 5 per cent, of the investments, and let
the Government run sweeps d la Tattersall on the big
events during the year? This would reduce the evil to a
minimum and get rid of the bookies and cronk jockeys.
The clubs could then give stakes sufficient to induce every
owner to be a goer. It is disgusting to see lazy fellows
standing in Irus abutting the principal streets taking
shillings and had-crowns from office and errand-boys in
the name of sport.—Yours, &0., Z.

The demised N. R. D. 15 >nd, sec. of the Vie.
torian Amateur Racing Club, devised the numbered
saddle-cloth. It is generally adopted in America, and is
spreading in Eng land.
An eccentric figure lately disappeared from the
English turf in “ Mr. Manton"—the Duchess of Montrose,
ajtat 76. Despite her age she comported herself as if 40
years younger. Scorning the fashions, she invariably
turned up at races in a flaming red dress, and her horses,
which were most successful, carried a fac-simile ot it.
During the four years prior to her recent retirement from
active racing, she won about £62,000 in stakes alone. Her
second husband, Slirling-Crawford, who died in ’B3, raced
horses in her ‘‘all scarlet” jacket, and won many rich
classic events. The Duchess thought more of Fred.
Archer and other leading jockeys than she did of anyone
else, and it was thought she would marry a knight of the
saddle. She didn’t, choosing, at the age of 70, Mr. 24-year-
old Henry Milner—brother, by the way, of the present
S.A. Governor’s private secretary. Their marriage caused
a sensation in English society, and so did their separation.

On a recent Sunday morning a race for £5O a-
side, from Dunnville (W.A.) to Coolgardie, 38 miles, came
off between L. Levinson’s pony Beauty and Gregory’s
mare Dolly. The horses were started from opjesite
the Wealth of Nations Mine, at 6.30 a.m. Levinson, on
his pony, reached the finish, Leaver’s Hotel, Coolgardie,
at 8.32 a.m., thus doing the whole distance in 2h. 2m.
Beauty is 13J hands high and carried 9st. 41b., being
only bush-fed. The road was hard, stony, rough and
sandy. Doily was about an hour behind.

At Brighton Beach (Melb.), on Boxing Day,
happened a raw-meat prize-fight. At 11.30 the principals
stood in the ring, stripped and accompanied by the
customary bottle-holders, &c. There were about 709
people present, including most of the local bookies,
whose vehicles made a close encircling rampart. Twenty-
nine earnest rounds were fought in a littlji over an hour,
and at the finish both men, whose identities are hidden
under the names “Bill” and “ Ned,” W’ere considerably,
though not irreparably damaged. Meantime, the police
were engaged in shooing lovers out of the scrub.

At Hannan’s Rush, Westralia, a boxer was
beaten through swallowing kerosene which his second and
bottle-holder had brought in mistake for something more
reviving. Had he trained in the cheap bars of Sydney, as
many pugs do, he’d never have noticed the difference.

“ Victor ” writes : —Georgie confirmed the good
opinion I have here expressed about her by winning the
Deo. Stakes from Bob Ray and Arihi, albeit the latter
made a grand fight of it under her 101 b. penalty, and but
for being blocked just above the distance would have at
least very nearly won. Bob Ray greatly improved on his
Melbourne form”, and will win a good race for Mr. O’Brien
this Autumn. Sir George will improve with age, and will,
as a three-year old, do credit to his sire. The Australian
Peer.
Moorefield has developed into a splendid horse,
and will yet prove himself a champion over any distance
up to a mile.
Loyalty’s ignoble displays in the A.J.O. Handi-
cap and Summer Cup were not calculated to inspire his
Tatt. Cup backers with confidence, yet I venture to
predict that if not to-day (Saturday) yet before the end
of the season we shall see him run a far different horse.
In trusting to Newman instead of The Captain
in the Summer Cup, Mr. Kelso threw away any chance he
had of landing that race. Newman has certainly proved
a most expensive horse. The Captain should, however,
be returned a winner ere many weeks are over.
In the Summer Cup, Donation certainly ran the
best of my original selections. His recent gallops have
done him much good, and he may bid boldly for Tatt’s
Cup. For the actual winner of this race, however, com-
mend me to my long-selected Tridentate, followed by
Warminster, Loyalty, and Donation.
At the past A.J.O. meeting there was amongst
the majority of the jockeys (?) riding a more than usual
display of the barbarity of mercilessly flogging their
mounts when hopelessly beaten. It really is time for the
stewards to take action in this matter. In many cases
owners might well make their lads ride whipless; for
race after race is thrown away by boys who flog their
mounts out of stride instead of riding them home vigor-
ously with hands and heels.
Recent magisterial decisions seem to interpret
the law that the man who acts as an agent for a tote
proprietor, and bets in the street, is not a principal, and,
as a result, the “ portable tote ” is now an accepted
Adelaide institution, and is the new employment for all
persons out of work. In Adelaide, if two sparrows settle
on a telegraph line, a tote-man immediately arrives and
accepts investments, paying out on the sparrow that
flies first.

Sydney Wool Sales.
M'Burnby, Wallis & Co. reportNo sales have been
held during the week including Christmas holidays, as
buyers claim the right of a rest after the incessant
valuing they have been compelled to cope with since
opening of the wcol season. On 3rd Jan. we will submit
a catalogue specially got up to include small clips. In
this manner small lots will command full attention of
buyers, who cannot be distracted by the presence of
larger clips as they may sometimes be in a mixed cata-
logue. Judging by private transactions prices are
equal to closing rates of last auctions. On 10th Jan. we
will bring forward a catalogue of about 2000 bales of
large clips from New England, Bathurst, Monaro, Goul-
burn, and other districts from which wool is now arriving
in the city.’ Sydney, 31st Dec., 1894.

Eureka stockade flag is said to be in the
possession of Mr. J arnes King, Minyip View (Vic.),

flagstaff on the stockade after the fight. Some
small strips were torn from it, but with that ex-
ception and some bullet-holes it is in good order.

The British Society of Psychical Research
recently sent circulars to a vast number of persons
asking if they had ever seen a ghost or other
supernatural manifestation, and requesting par-
ticulars of the apparition if one had been seen.
Out of 17,000 who responded, 655 men and 1029
women claimed to have either seen a spectre or to
have had reason to believe that one was about.
This marked preponderance of the female element
suggests that a good many she-ghosts are really
hysterics. And if she-ghosts are largely hysterics
then there ensues the further possibility that he-
ghosts are sometimes whisky.
A young Englishman (Wittingham) was
lately condemned at Paris to 20 years’ imprison-
ment for the murder of his French wife. The
proceedings at the trial read curiously unlike those
of British courts. General Wittingham, the
prisoner’s father, was openly blamed by the Pro-
curator of the Republic for his absence of due
affection. “ You have failed in all your duties as
a father,” urged the official. “ You may have
been a brave soldier and a gentleman ; you might
in your pride of caste have at first repulsed the
poor girl who was your son’s wife; but, as her
conduct was irreproachable, you should have
received her who was to become the mother of
your grandson.”
William Saunders, of Rue Australia, to
his friend Watson, of Dubbo (N.S.W.): “I reckon
myself the worst sort of fool. This place does not
suit a single man at all and few married ones.
There are over a hundred gone from here, and
they are scattered over the country, and some of
them are working for Is. Bd. per day, and have to
find themselves out of that. For any clothing
you buy, you have to pay as much as you do in
Australia. The only things that are cheap are
tobacco and rum. You can buy rum for about
Bd. per bottle, and tobacco for 2d. per lb. The
natives of the country are very homely people.
The women all smoke and do all the work, and
the men simply do the looking on. There are
very few men in the country. They nearly all got
killed in the war. The women are not what you
might call pretty. They are mostly copper-
colored. They never wear any boots, but they
are very clean and good dancers. ... I am
working the blacksmith’s shop, but the summer
will be too hot to work at any trade. . . Wild
beasts are not so plentiful as represented. . , .
If I could get enough money to carry me to a sea-
port, I would soon be in Australia. I would
sooner be in gaol there than free here. . . It is
all paper money here. The Paraguayan dollar is
only worth about 7d. of English money. The
morals of the country are none to boast of. There
are very few marriages, and of the children born,
70 per cent, are illegitimate.”
A Sydney evening paper publishes edito-
rially a statement that Govt, surveyors’ work is
plotted on the map without check-survey. The
Bulletin is informed that the district surveyors
make a check-survey twice annually. Whatever
the shortcomings of the surveys were in the old
days, when they were performed, as often as not,
by means of a rum-bottle and the table of a
big landed proprietor, the system in operation in
N.S.W. is as little open to criticism as the
Ordnance survey of Great Britain—perhaps the
one department of English administration to
which no suspicion of jobbery ever attached.

I THOS MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 547 George-street, Sydney, in the Colony of
New South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome affection of the Nerves which
affected me so much that I was quite unable to a: tend to my business. I tried several doctors
and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr
Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “ Alkaline
Vitality Pills,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare Completely Cured Me with-
in a few weeks, and although this is over five
years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alkaline Pills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

THE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “ Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim for this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors
The JOHN F. TAYLOR COMPANY.
Head Office for Australasia: 409 Oollins-street, Melbourne,

'J'HE Index, an International Review of Insurance, Trade and Finance, writes as follows respecting the
LIVERPOOL & LONDON & GLOBE
Total Assets — INSURANCE COMPANY. -£9,083,790
For years past sensationalism has been rampant in the fire insurance world; and to find'that a Company which
has steadily declined to d viate fr in the quiet far-seeing and self-respecting policy which has given the Liverpool and
London and Globe its proud position, which has refused to be tempted into any lurid display of financial fireworks,
continues to so easily outdistance all its competitors, is a special pleasure and gratification to those who wish to pre-
vent fire insurance from degem rating into a mad scramble for other people’s loaves and fishes, and who desire to see
the dignity of the profession worthily upheld.
The flie department for the past year shows an increase of premium income of over £43,000, and a trading account
surplus of £70,954, or about 4J per cent, of the premiums. The figures for three years will serve by way of com-
parison :
Premium Surplus on
Year. income. Losses. trading account.
1891 .... 1,479,783 .... 989,605 .... 29,309
1892 .... 1,585,195 1,029,567 .... 79,513
1893 .... 1,628,224 .... 1,070,585 .... 70,954
This Company has a wise and straightforward plan of keeping a fire re-insurance fund, altogether apart from its
general reserve, and we should like to see this adopted by every fire office. Each year, as the premium income in-
creases, a portion of the trading surplus is added to this fund, maintaining the amount at about 45 per cent, of the
premium income. The amount so transferred on the present occasion is £36,000, bringing up the fire re-insurance
fund to £740,000, and leaving £44,954 to be carried to profit and loss account. By this method not onlyds the un-
expired liability constantly and separately provided for, but the true profit of the year is honestly shown. The
adoption of this system would not at all suit many companies ; but in this, as in other respects, the report of the
Liverpool and London and Globe is a model one. Against a premium income of £1,628,224, the total fire funds of the
Company, exclusive of the paid-up capital of £245,640, and allowing for dividend now stand as follows:
General Reserve .... ... £1,300,000
Fire Re-insurance Fund ... .... 740,000
Balance of Profit and Loss Account.. . .... £61,392
£2,601,392
This is more than one and a-half times the total premium income, a magnificent financial position to occupy.

When Gladstone dies, the enormous
English hypocrisy will look in vain for a smug utter-
ance to equal his. Reports of Armenian atrocities
have stimulated the exploiter of Bulgarian horrors
to say [vide cable) that as a reward for the Turks’
cruelty and injustice God has reduced their ter-
ritory by half during the last generation. This
nauseous cant comes well from a representative of
the nation which annually massacres its tens of
thousands of victims to social injustice, aristo-
cratic tyranny, and capitalistic greed. Throat-
cutting is a merciful death compared with that by
starvation in London slums, or by disease in the
Midland factory-hells.
Dear Bulletin, —The use of firearms to
frighten, and not to kill, is becoming ordinary in
N.S. Wales. The papers reported two cases on
two consecutive days. In one case, a station-hand
fired over the head of a man who was running
away from him (so goes the story), and the latter
returned the shot, with effect. Then a Sydney
publican, whose house was being bombarded with
blue-metal, came out to remonstrate with a shot-
gun, and “fired in the air,” lodging a good pro-
portion of the charge in a youth’s back. The
police called this “self-defence.” A man is only
legally justified in using a deadly weapon in self-
defence when he has just reason to think his own
life in danger. He must not use such a weapon
in endeavoring to arrest even a felon or murderer,
if the arrest can be effected in any other way.
That is the law, let the police say what they
will.—R.
“Maoriland,” for which The Bulletin
has consistently “ barracked ” for years, has found
its way into London Athkilbum. This gives an
imprimatur to the term. Why doesn’t Premier
Seddon abolish “New Zealand?” It will be
done sooner or later, and he might as well have
the credit of the change.
Russia hasn't a pound of coal on the Paci-
fic, and every ton of fuel used by the men-of-war at
Yladivostock has to be imported from Oronstadt.
Lately a Russian ironclad on its way to join the
Pacific squadron ran out of coal and put into
Capetown. The Cape dealers asked .£8 a ton and
the Russian had to pay. In war-time he could
have got none at all.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Ten of us, eager as men may be,
Rode through the night to the distant sea.
One of us, riding with reins held slack
Stumbled and fell on the stone-strewn track;
And one of us turned by his side to stay,
But eight of us carelessly galloped away.
Eight of us, eager as men may be,
Rode through the night to the distant sea.
Where the track led over the black-soil loam
One of us slackened and turned for home;
And one of us rested his galloping beast,
To join in the dance of a bridal feast:
But six of us, eager as men may be,
Rode through the night to the distant sea.
Lured by the lights and the cheer within,
Two of us paused at a wayside inn ;
And three of us stayed at the edge of a wood,
Where a bevy of beckoning women stood :
Leaving of all the ten, but me,
Riding alone to the distant sea.

Dear Bulletin, —Looking over the balance-
sheet of the Australasian Institute of Journalists,
I find that the largest sum spent to Sept. 30 was
£l7 for badges—ridiculous little trinkets, the proud
members’ signboards ; and about the smallest sum
disbursed was .£3, which extravagant amount was
squandered upon destitute journalists. Up to
date nothing but empty grovel has been bestowed
upon the Creat Moguls of the society, David Syme
and Sam Winter; but when the outstanding subs.,
.£206, are collected these gentlemen will probably
receive a silver statuette apiece.—Yours, S.

Dear Bulletin, —Rev. Wm. Brown,
Methodist Missionary to New B'itain, writing to
the Australian Methodist Missionary Review
r marks, in reference to returned Kanakas from Q.
plantations :
They go away from their homes simple savages, beguiled
by the sight of the trader’s merchandise, and with the
prospect of some “ trade ” to call their own at the end of
their three years nf hard labor in the sugar or cotton
plantations ; but when they return they come with their
mouths full of “ pidgin ” English and filthy conversation.
1 know all this is true because I have talked with some of
these returned laborers, and have been grieved to think
that it was from white men that they acquired this un-
clean conversation full of the vilest oaths. And there in
that village were men who had serv d their three years in
the white man’s land, and yeWwere as keen to taste of the
human flesh as the savage pure and simple.
With regard to which one would like to ask a
few questions, viz.—(L) Are there, no missionaries
whose duty it is to look after the souls of the
niggers on the plantations? (2). If not, why not?
Is it because a missionary in Queensland, under
the cold eyes of the planters, would have a poor
time of it compared to what he would have as a
little tin god in the island homes of the heathen?
(3). If there are such missionaries in Queensland
how do they account for the shocking general
result of their labors mentioned by the Rev.
Brown, one of their own cloth ? (4). With refer-
ence to the avidity with which, according to the
latter, they return to their human flesh-pots, can
any of your readers (who may have made a study
of the obscure subject of cannibalism) throw any
light upon the real facts in connection with the
weird statements and dark hints attributed to
European travellers in cannibal countries who
have been compelled to eat human flesh, and to
castaway sailors who have had to do so through
necessity, to the effect that the man who once eats
man oraVes for him ever afterwards? An answer
to the la-t question will satisfy my curiosity.
The others 1 don’t really care about.— Creeve
Roe.


A Lady’s Letter.
Dear Maude, Tf Tf >
It is quite impossible to say how
much I appreciate your beautiful gift.
Owing to remissness on the part of our
housekeeper, I did not receive it until
last evening, or you would sooner have
had my most hearty thanks.
The truth is, we were all talking
the other day about Tea, and wondering
where we could get really good Tea,
but hitherto our efforts have not been
quite successful. When we got the
beautiful caddy of "My Favorite" Tea
we all rushed into the kitchen, and
whilst one boiled the kettle the others
got cups and saucers, and we soon
tasted the delicious mixture. Why, it
is a Tea to dream of ! It is, my dear
Maude, simply perfect, and you are a
darling for sending us the pretty caddy.
Again thanking you for your kind
remembrance, and for having solved such
a problem in our domestic affairs.
Believe me. Dear Maude,
Sincerely yours,
FLORENCE ■.

SOMETHING ABOUT TWO BOYS.
" Thk most pathetic incident of my childhood is
this ; My mother had been very ill for several
weeks, and the doctor solemnly announced that
she oould not live more than two or three days
longer at most. That night my father roused me
from sleep and took me out of my little bed to bid
her a last good-bye. I shall never forget the
scene, which was new and awful to me. People
were weeping all round the room, the air of which
was heavy with the odour of caudles and lamps,
and reeking with the fumes of drugs. My mother
knew and kissed me, and then they took me back
to my bed. But ere I was led away some one
opened the window a few inches from the top, and
I noticed the grey dawn resting on the glass, and
heard the ‘cheep, cheep,’ of a newly-awakened
bird. Since then I have associated that hour and
sound with that unhappy episode.
“ But {and to say what now follows I have
written the foregoing paragraph) we were all
rasped and tortured for nothing. My mother
proceeded to get well hand-over-hand, and died
quietly thirty years afterwards. She survived
every person who stood at her bedside that night,
except me."
Speaking of the illness of her son, a boy of
nine, a lady says : “We had to sit with him
night and day, giving him brandy, wine, beef-
tea, &0., to keep him alive, and expected every
day would be his last. The physician plainly told
us that nothing more oould be done to save him.”
Yet, in spite of the disease, and —we almost
said —in spite of the doctors, the lad is well to-day.
And this is how it all came about. There is a
moral in it, too, but suppose we serve that up at
the end of the story. All right, you say. Very
well, then.
It seems that this boy, George Westmoreland,
had previously been a strong, healthy little chap,
as all boys ought to be. But about the middle of
last November —1891, that is—he was taken
down. The family couldn’t make out what ai.ed
him. He complained of a bad pain in the stomach,
and vomited a quantity of yellowish-green stuff.
Presently the pain was so sharp he couldn’t lie in
bed, and they had, so his mother says, to apply
fresh hot poultices one after another. The whites
of his eyes turned yellow, and his skin, too. He was
hot, and feverish, and had to fight for his breath.
Of course his mother sent for a doctor, and the
doctor said his young patient was suffering from
inflammation of the bowels. He gave medicines
which, however, did no good, so far as the boy’s
friends could see. On the contrary, he grew
worse, and a second doctor was fetched. This
medical gentleman differed from his predecessor,
and gave out that George had an attack of rheu-
matic fever—in other words, acute rheumatism
a disease which no boy has any business with
whatever.
The treatment on this theory availed nothing ;
George was worse. He now had a hacking cough,
and his expectoration was so offensive that the
people had to use disinfectants. He broke out
into sweats, so heavy as to saturate the pillows.
He could take no nourishment save a little milk
and lime water. He wore away to a skeleton, did
the poor boy. He was nothing but skin and bone,
and they had to lift him in and out of bed. Then
he fell so ill he would not notice anyone in the
room, and lay for hours never opening his eyes.
Then came the time when a third doctor said he
couldn’t possibly live.
What happened after that the boy’s mother
tells. We give you her exact words : “In
February last,” she says, “my husband, as a last
resource, determined to try Mother Seigel’s Cura-
tive Syrup. After a few doses the boy’s breathing
was easier and he took food. In three days he
was able to sit up, and in a week’s time he was up
and dressed. He gained flesh and strength every
day, and is now able to go about. Sometimes I
look at him and can hardly believe he is the same
boy who was so recently at death’s door. Seigel’s
Syrup saved his life. Yours truly, (signed) Mrs.
Mary Westmoreland, 5, High Street, Plumstead,
London, April 27, 1892.”
Now, half a dozen words. Little George had
no bowel inflammation, nor a single touch of rheu-
matism. That was the doctors’ professional guess-
work. He had a sharp attack of biliousness and
indigestion, of which Mother Seigel would have
cured him long before had her medicine been
appealed to. Here is the moral to conclude with :
Learn what the true remedy for illness is, and use
it first instead of last.
In Japan children are taught to write with
both hands. The distinct advantage of this is
shown in the forgery returns.
One beneficial result of the Melb. Herald-
Standard amalgamation has been the temporary
abolition of boy-reporting labor in the southern
city.
The Vincentian Fathers are crusading
round Melb. suburbs with a R.O. teetotal mission
greatly to the disgust of Murphy and Hogan, wh,
keep pubs.
The Vic. Parliamentary Standing Com-
mittee on Railways recommends the construction
of a railway from Jurnburrna to Outtrim, on two
notable saving conditions —(1) that all the land
required be handed over as a free gift; and (2)
that the interested coal companies guarantee a
revenue equal to 4 per cent, on the cost of con-
struction. At last, a worthy lead from the
Cabbage-Garden!
It has at last been amply demonstrated
that a really rousing, effective funeral sermon
is productive of good results. A Christchurch
(M.L.) family who believed that two young
men relatives went down with the Wairarapa,
ordered an exceedingly sad and impressive
discourse to be delivered in the church, and two
days afterwards the boys turned up and wanted to
know if dinner was ready.
The Sydney papers have reprinted the full
text of the ponderous Times article pointing out
how desirable it was that, after being such asses
as to take their disputes to the other end of the
world for settlement, Australians should now send
a Judge in pursuit of the cases to settle them.
More approving articles have appeared in the
nobbled organs of legal opinion, without a ghost
of a hint that the matter could be settled much
more simply by abolishing appeals to England,
and letting the same Judge settle the same cases
in Australia. The job is nearly ripe for Parlia-.
mentary exposure now.
Melb. Age has a complaint to make about
the alleged Australian fleet, crying that it never
risks itself in the morass called Hobson’s Bay, but
stays always in the safe waters of Port Jackson.
The obvious necessity for warships to stay in a
safe place doesn’t strike the Aok. The warship is
the most expensive theory afloat, and even naval
experts know it isn’t safe to let one out after dark,
lest it should run into itself or fall overboard.
U.S.A. warship Atlantis lately tried its ram on a
rotten old derelict, but the derelict continued to
float, and the warship crawled in a crippled state
into port. When the Carnperdown accidentally
rammed the Victoria, the Victoria went down,
but the Carnperdown nearly went down, too, A
big ironclad is about as brittle as glass. The pro-
babilities of the first naval battle are that all the
ships will disable themselves within 15 minutes of
commencing action. Then the naval experts will
build more fleets capable of still more incapacity.
About this time democracy will rise in two or
three places at once, and will take the naval
experts by the scruff of the neck, also the Fat
Men, and princes, and Rule Britannia, and the
whole bag of tricks, and will throw them into the
sea, where they will sink down softly to join the
fleets. But the Australian squadron will continue
its picnic in Sydney Harbor—except in November,
when it will go to Melbourne Cup, if the sea is
calm.
The wheeze concerning the “ disappearing
Australian seaman ” is about the most empty
agitation that has occurred for a number of years.
As a matter of fact, there is no disappearing Aus-
tralian seamen. There never were enough Aus-
tralian seamen to make their decrease noticeable.
The most unobservant traveller can verify this for
himself, as ten out of every dozen sailors, at any
time during the memory of most people now
living, were either known as “Olsen,” “Oscar,”
or “ Carl,” and they are only too willing to accept
wages that would make the disappearance of any
Australian seaman, let alone his family, a matter
of very brief time. Thirty years ago the dis-
appearing Australian seaman was mostly English
or Scotch ; now he is mostlv Scandinavian, and
that is all the difference. Were the sailor-man’s
remuneration less of a pittance and more of a
wage, and his life not quite so much that of a dog,
there might have been an Australian seaman
whose decadence would have been a fit subject for
lamentation. As it happens, there never was one.

“The Green Carnation."
“The Green Carnation ” is a new book which has
succeeded to the vogue of “ Tlie Yellow Aster,”
and which is many times wittier and worthier to
hold the fort of notoriety. Here are some petals;—
• * *
“Goodness is merely another name for cowar-
dice. We all have a certain disease of tendencies
that inclines us to certain things labelled sins. If
we check our tendencies, we drive the disease
inwards ; but if we sin we throw it off. Sup-
pressed measles are far more dangerous than
measles that come out.”
# # •
To the suggestion of morning opera it was
objected that patrons would be unfitted for the
duties of the day. “Quite so,” said Mr.
Amarinth, with extreme gentleness. “ That would
be the object of the performance, to unfit one for
the duties of the day. How beautiful 1 What a
Slorious sight it would be to see a great audience
ocking out into the orange-colored sunshine,
each unit of which was thoroughly unfitted for
any duties whatsoever. It makes me perpetually
sorrowful in London to meet with people doing
their duty. I find them everywhere. It is im-
possible to escape from them. A sense of duty is
like some horrible disease. It destroys the tissues
of the mind, as certain complaints destroy the
tissues of the body. The catechism has a great
deal to answer for.”
» • •
“Women always expect something. Women
are like minors, they live upon their expecta-
tions.”
* # #
“ Probably we suffer from the activity of our
forefathers. When I feel fatigued I always think
that my grandfather must have been what is
called an excellent walker.”
# * *
“My wife began by trying to influence me, she
has ended by trying not to be influenced by me.
She is a good woman, Reggie, and wears large
hats. Why do good women invariably wear large
hats ? To show they have large hearts ?”
# # #
“I hate offering payment to anybody,” said
Reggie, “ even when I have the money. There is
something so sordid about it. To give is beautiful.
I said so to my tailor yesterday. He answered,
‘I differ from you, sir, in toto.' How horrible
this spread of education is !”
* # #
“Nothing on earth is so absolutely middle-class
as Nature. She always reminds me of Clement
Scott’s articles in the Daily Telegraph.”
# * *
“ A virtue is like a city set upon a hill, it can-
not be hid. We can conceal our vices if we care
to, for a time at least. We can take our beautiful
Eurple sin like a candle and hide it under a
ushel ; but a virtue will out. Virtuous people
always have odd noses, or holy mouths, or a reli-
gious walk. Nothing in the world is so painful as
to see a good man masquerading in the company
of sinners. He may drink and blaspheme, he may
robe himself in scarlet, and dance the can-can,
but he is always virtuous. The mind of the
moulin rouge is not his. Wickedness does not sit
easily upon him. It looks like a coat that has
been paid for.”
• * *
“ Respectable elderly women do so much harm.
Prolonged purity wrinkles the mind as much as
prolonged impurity wrinkles the face. Nature
forces us to choose whether we will spoil our faces
with our sins or our minds with our virtues.”
# # #
“He looks astonishingly young.” “Yes, he says
that his sins keep him fresh. A sinner with a
young lamb’s heart among the full-grown flocks of
saints, you know.”
* # *
“ I believe that money is gradually becoming
extinct, like the dodo. It is vanishing off the face
of the earth. Soon we shall have people writing
to the papers to say that money has been seen at
Richmond, or the man who always announces the
premature advent of the cuckoo to his neighbor-
hood will communicate the fact that one spring
day he heard two capitalists singing in a wood
near Esher. One hears now that money is tight—
a most vulgar condition to be in, by the way ; one
will hear in the future that money is not. Then
we shall barter, offer glass beads for a lunch, or
sell our virtue for a good dinner.”
* * •
“ To sin beautifully is one of the most com-
plicated of the arts. There are hardly six people
in a century who can master it. The artist in sin-
ning improves upon the sins that Nature has put,
as it‘Were, ready to his hand. He idealises, he
invents, he develops. No trouble is too great for
him to take, no day is too long for him to work in.
The still and black-robed night hours find him
toiling to perfect his sin ; the weary white dawn,
looking into his weary white face through the
shimmering window-panes, is greeted by a smile
that leaps from sleepless eyes. The passion of
the Creator is upon him. The man who invents
a new sin is greater than the man who invents a
new religion. No Mrs. Humphrey Ward can
snatch his glory from him. Religions are the
Aunt Sallies that men provide for elderly female
venturists to throw missiles at and to demolish.
What sin that has ever been invented has ever
been demolished ? There are always new human
beings springing into life to commit it, and to
find pleasure in it. Some day I will write a
gospel of strange sins, and I will persuade (me
P.C.K. Society to publish it in dull, misty
scarlet powdered with golden devils.”
* * *
“ Good people love hearing about sin. Haven’t
you noticed that although the sinner takes no
sort of interest in the saint, the saint has always
an uneasy curiosity about the doings of the
sinner ?”
# * *
“ People who mean well always do badly. They
are like the ladies who wear clothes that don’t fit
them in order to show their piety. Good inten-
tions are invariably ungrammatical.”
• * •
“ The moon is the religion of the night.”
* # •
“Esmi is the bravest man I know. I think
sometimes that he sins even more perfectly than I
do. He is so varied. And he escapes those
absurd things consequences. His sin always finds
him out. He is never at home to it by any
chance.”
* * *
“Good morning,” he said softly. “Is not this
marmalade Godlike? This marvellous, clear
amber glow, amber with a touch of red in it,
almost makes me believe in an after life. Surely,
surely marmalade can never die.”
# • •
“We are so frightfully punctual that I feel
quite like an early Christian. I wonder why the
Christians were always so early before we were
born. They are generally very late now.”
# # •
“I know,” said Reggie Hastings, holding his
fair head slightly on one side, and crumbling his
bread with a soft white hand. “ I know. That
is why I laughed at my brother’s funeral. My
grief expressed itself in that way. People were
shocked, of course, but when are _ they not
shocked ? There is nothing so touching as the
inappropriate. I thought my laughter was very
beautiful. Anybody can cry. That was what I
felt. I forced my grief.”
Maoriland Graphic alludes to the “ Con-
vent of the Immaculate Conception,” at Nelson,
as the “ Convent of the Irish Conception.” The
Graphic is a profoundly serious paper, too, and
never makes a joke unless by a very bad accident
indeed.

well, a casual cuss. The native-born article—who has
passed the fourth standard—is about as casual as you
make ’em. He is not ungrateful, but to express his
gratitude would compromise his independence. He
doesn’t mean to be rude, but to be polite he thinks would
savour of servility. So he is just—casual. You are
having billy-tea on top of the Fort Hills, for example, and
he comes along—sweating, puffing, generally done up.
You kindly hail him. “Would you like a cup of tea?”
Of course he would-the very thing. His stolid face
almost looks grateful : but it soon recovers its stolidity
and he answers, “ Don’t mind if 1 do.” He always says
that. Offer him a drink, a fill of baccy, a feed, or a shake-
down ; the answer is always the same, “Don’t mind if I
do.” The phrase is really a stroke of genius. In some
subtle way it shifts all the obligations on to your
shoulders, and you feel quite ashamed to think you are
not more grateful to him for accepting your drink.
Which is mostly true. Bub then Max O’Rell was
not an observer in any sense of the term, and the
casualness of the Australian “ cuss ” didn t strike
him.
A ghostly comforter writes as follows :
Dear Bulletin, — I object to the unbelieving manner in
which you refer to an existence other than this. Tell me
how it is impossible and why .it is wonderful? I was not, I
am, why cannot I always be? I desire to know the
following things {inter alia)'. (1.) Is there a supreme
controlling power? If so, are its intentions to me bene-
volent or otherwise ? (2.) Is there a Heaven ? If so, will
I get into it ? (3.) Is there a Hell ? If so, will I keep out
of it? (I.) Are you aware that, as you are reading this
essence of wi-dom, you are travelling through space at
the rate of 56 miles an hour, fastened to a rounded mass
that, viewed far enough off, reflects a pale, hardly-\ isible
light, and looks a tiny speck amidst a mass of others?
(5) Do you ever reflect that you will be dead in about ten
years, and the hands that now hold this paper, the lips
that now smile with cynical criticism will be motionless
and rigid? That your bodv will be stuffed some day in a
woodeTi box and lowered with indifferent hands into the
earth, and left there to rot? Try to contemplate your
own funeral. Does it make you feel choked and lonely ?
(6) Did you ever notice how interesting a trousers button
becomes viewed in the light of a century, or so, hence?
Primitive man required not a trousers button, what will
the future superior being use? (7) Did you ever realise
that a globular immensity was created. Various exis-
tences appeared on its surface, stamped their feet, and
thought themselves the centre of creation. You and I
appear and stamp, and prefer ourselves to the rest of
humanity. We will also disappear and others will come
after us who will not know us. They all, in due course,
will stamp and be convinced that the universe is incom-
plete without their particular existence. Yet they say
man is a free agent! I say—Bah I—Your Fellow Sinner,

West by North, Again.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
We’ve drunk our wine, we’ve kissed our girls, and
funds are sinking low,
The horses must be thinking it’s a fair thing now
to go;
Sling up the swags on “Condamine” and strap
the billies fast,
And stuff a bottle in the bags and let’s be off at
last.
What matter if the creeks are “up”—the cash,
alas ! runs down !
A very sure and certain sign we’re long enough in
town.
The nigger rides the “boko,” and you’d better
take the bay,
“ Quart Pot ” will do to carry me the stage we
go to-day.
No grass this side the Border-fence ! and all the
mulga’s dead !
The horses for a day or two will have to spiel
ahead ;
Man never yet from Queensland brought a bullock
or a hack
But lost condition on that God-abandoned Border
track.
When once we’re through “ the rabbit-proof ” —it s
certain since the rain—
There’s whips o’grass and water. So, it’s West
by North again !
There’s “ feed ” on Tyson’s country—we can
“ spell ” the mokes a week
Where Billy Stevens last year trapped his brumbies
on Bough Creek.
The Paroo may be quickly cross’d —the Eulo Com-
mon ’s bare;
And, anyhow, it isn’t wise, old man ! to dally
there.
Alack-a-day 1 far wiser men than you and I
succumb
To woman’s wiles—and potency of Queensland
wayside rum.
Then over sand and spinifex ! and on, o’er ridge
and plain !
The nags are fresh—besides, they know they’re
Westward-bound again.
The brand upon old “ Darkie’s ” thigh is that
upon the hide
Of bullocks we must muster on the Diaraantina
side.
We’ll light our camp-fires where we may, and
yarn beside their blaze ;
The jingling hobble-chains shall make a musn
through the days.
And while the tucker-bags are right, and we’ve a
stick of “ weed,”
A swagman shall be welcome to a pipe-full and a
feed.
So, fill your pipe ! and, ere we mount, we’ll drink
another nip,
“ Here’s how that West by North again may
prove a lucky trip,”
Then back again—l trust you’ll find your best
girl’s merry face,
Or, if she jilts you, may you get a better in her
place.

The Old Bark School: An Echo.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was the first Monday after the holidays. The
children had taken their seats in the Old Bark
School, and the master called out the roll as
usual ;
“ Arvie Aspinall.” . . . “’Es, sir.”
“ David Cooper.” . . , “Yes, sir.”
“ John Heegard.” . . . “Yezzer.”
“Joseph Swallow.” . . , “ Yesser.”
“James Bullock.” . . , “Present.”
“Frederick Swallow.” , . . “Y’sir.”
“James Nowlett.” . . . (Chorus of “Ab-
sent.”)
“ William Atkins.” . . . (Chorus of “ Ab-
sent.”)
“ Daniel Lyons. ” . . . “Perresent, sor-r-r. ”
Dan was a young immigrant, just out from the
,*od, and rolled his “r’s” like a cock-dove. His
brogue was rich enough to make an Irishman
laugh.
Bill was “ waggin’ it.” His own especial chum
was of the opinion that Bill was sick. The mas-
ter’s opinion didn’t coincide, so he penned a note
to William’s parents, to be delivered by the model
boy of the school.
“Bertha Lambert” . . . “Yes,’air.”
“May Carey” . . . “Pesin’, sair.”
“Rose Cooper” . . . “Yes, sir.”
“Janet Wild” . , . “Y-y-yes, s-sir.”
“Mary Wild” . . .
A solemn hush fell upon the school, and pre-
sently Janet Wild threw her arms out on the desk
before her, let her face fall on them, and sobbed
heart-brokenly. The master saw his mistake too
late; he gave his head a little, half-affirmative,
half-negative movement, in that pathetic old way
of his ; rested his head on one hand, gazed sadly
at the name, and sighed.
But the galoot of the school spoilt the pathos of
it all, for, during the awed silence which followed
the calling of the girl’s name, he suddenly
brightened up—the first time he was ever observed
to do so during school hours—and said, briskly
and cheerfully:—
“ Dead—sir !”
He hadn’t been able to answer a question cor-
rectly all the morning.
“ Children,” said the master gravely and sadly,
“children, this is the first time I ever had to put
*D ’ to the name of one of my scholars. Poor
Mary! she was one of my first pupils—came the
first morning the school was opened. Children, I
want ye to be a little quieter to-day during play-
hour, out of respect for the name of your dead
schoolmate whom it has pleased the Almighty to
take in her youth.”
“Please, sir,” asked the galoot, evidently en-
couraged by his fancied success—“please, sir,
what does ‘ D ’ stand for?”
“ Damn you for a hass ! ” snarled Jim Bullock
between his teeth, giving the galoot a vicious dig
in the side with his elbow.
HENRY LAWSON.
A Northern legislator attributes the disease
affecting pine apples in the Moreton district (Q.)
to the fact that the farmers “do not saw off the
dry limbs from the trees often enough.”
The Unspeakable Englishman.
Grant Allen’s truly awful tale, “ A Triumph of
Civilisation,” in the Graphic Christmas Number,
is the latest and most maddening injustice to
Australia. G.A. is a pretty good minor philo-
sopher, and his novels are tolerable; but as a
short-story writer he chiefly ranges from cheap to
nasty and back again. The scene of “A Triumph
of Civilisation ’’ is laid in the Gulf of Carpentaria.
The heroine is on a steam-yacht, which meanders
into the Gulf during a “thick, dismal fog,
worthy of Newfoundland banks,” and gets
wrecked on a “coral reef” with "jagged peaks ”
and “jutting pinnacles.” “ Breakers’’—in-
cluding “a curious white wall of water” —
“pound” the vessel “with incredible energy”
upon “the fierce fangs of rook.” The fog, by-
the-by, has lasted for several days, during which
the yacht’s master “ could get no observations,
the sky was so dim; and was compelled, for the
most part, to go by dead-reckoning.” Anybody
who has never been in the Gulf will recognise the
truth of this description at once. It is a devil of
a place for fogs, coral reefs and breakers.
But the story is waiting. Naked Australians,
armed with long spears (as is, of course, the
fashion in the Gulf country) swarm whooping
over the heroine—Australian natives always
whoop—and “dragher cruelly by the hair to their
encampment, prodding her from time to time
with a spear to make her go faster.” Then the
heroine disappears for 10 years. At the end of
that time a famous explorer (probably Lumholtz)
comes to lecture in London, and tells the legend
of a white woman kept in captivity among the
N.Q. blacks. The heroine’s daughter, Camilla,
is at the lecture ; and when she hears the legend,
“a thrill, cold as ice, ran down Camilla’s spine.”
She at once determines to go with her husband and
free the captive. Another steam-yacht is char-
tered, and they come out to Australia. The geo-
graphical detail is simply gorgeous :
They cruised cautiously down the East coast of the
Gulf, for even to this day, in spite of surveys and charts,
the tropical shores of Carpentaria are but little known
to European mariners. That great bight lies so far out
of the track of modern commerce that none but pro-
fessional explorers ever penetrate jar into its useless cul-
de-sac. [This is a nasty jar for the Burketown mail-
steamers.] . . . Anchoring in a small bay, under
shelter of a low headland of ruddy rock(!) just crowned
by a few gaunt screw-pines and towering blue-gum
trees (!!) they put out a boat in the direction of a sandy
beach (!!!) where a faint blue column of smoke showed
the probable site of a native encampment.
More naked blackfellows (it seems that the
whole coast of Carpentaria is lined with naked
blackfellows) rush frantically down to the water’s
edge, waving more spears. They say that the
white woman is eight days’ march westward, and
westward Camilla goes.
So for two days they crept on along a reef-bound coast,
with most intricate navigation, hugging the shore within
the rocks, where their scanty charts availed them any-
thing.
Singularly enough, they didn’t meet any
steamers; but after two days’ slow steaming they
come to another sandy beach, and there Camilla
and her husband and the doctor go ashore, and
find three children ready waiting for them—
“ranging from three to eight years old.”
Camilla raised her glasses again and took a long, good
look at them.
“ Why, they are not so very black; they’re only
brown 1” she exclaimtd in some astonishment.
The doctor looked grave os he stepped ashore, firmly
grasping his revolver. “ Well, ye—es,” he said, in a
strangely restrained voice. “They’re brown—light
brown ; a great deal lighter, in fact, than I ever saw three
native Australian children.”
A sickening sense of horror came all at once over
Camilla’s soul.
Then you sit tight and read a horrible descrip-
tion of Camilla’s mother, illustrated with a yet
more horrible picture. She is “naked, save for a
kirtle of rough grasses as worn in Carpentaria;
and she throws hersejf at Camilla’s feet, while her
dusky brood cling round her knees. Then Ruth
Mordaunt rises to the situation. Shall “those
sailors in the background spread the tale of
Camilla’s mother’s shame, to vex Camilla’s soul,
through the London newspapers?” Never-r-r !
The doctor’s revolver hung loosely in his hand. Long
habituation to the shifts of savage life had given Ruth
Mordaunt the skill and courage to act promptly in emer-
gencies. With an impetuous dart forward the wild
woman seized the deadly weapon. Then she stepped
three paces back. Camilla, appalled, clung wildly to her
husband. Ruth Mordaunt raised the weapon with un-
trembling hand. In the plenitude of her motherly love,
in the infinity of her mercy, she fired two cartridges—
one at Camilla, the other at Eric. In a second two bodies
lay reddening the white sand with their blood in front of
her. Before she could raise it again and turn it against
her own heart one of the sailors rushed forward and
wrenched the pistol from her hand. But Ruth Mordaunt
was not to be baulked of her own self-inflicted punish-
ment. Breaking away from the man’s grasp, like the
savage she had half become, she ran lightly along the
sand and sealed, with hands and feet, one of the rocky
pinnacles that jutted into the water. One moment she
paused with hands and arms extended on the topmost
peak; then she plunged into the deep basin and held her
breath below till the life was gone out of her.
The doctor turned to the crew with a face of mute
83’tnpafhy. “That was finely done!” he said, after a
long, deep pause. “No other way was possible ! ’Twaa
a triumph of civilisation I She. died, after all, like an
English lady /"
!!!!!!!!!
And this compound of grotesque bathos and gross
ignorance is solemnly put before the public, not
as a wild freak of “English humor,” but as a
serious essay in literature by a leading English
author.
The central axiom of Theosophy is “ He
that hath eyes to see let him put his head in a
bag.”—Westminster Gazette.
Regularly every Monday morning, writes
a correspondent, a cart may be seen driving
up to a certain station within 20 miles of
Sydney, and depositing on the Govt, railway-
platform a couple of casks of illicit spirits
which are duly forwarded to the city by the next
State-owned train which oomes along; and as
regularly as that cart puts in an appearance with
its illegal load of blue ruin, the local policeman
may be observed thoughtfully scratching his chin
and looking hard in the opposite direction.
Wairarapaevidence. Davis, A. 8., said:—
“It took me all my time to prevent witness, French,
getting into the boat."
French, ex-marine :
“ I wish to vindicate my honor as an Englishman and a
man. I never attempted to get into the boat. I would
not attempt it, neither in that boat nor any other boat.”
2nd officer :
“ Dr. Harris was the first I took 00 the raft into the
boat. He begged to be taken in.”
Dr. Harris :
“I was not the first to be taken into the boat. I did
not beg to be taken in. I only got in because I was
entreated to do so.”
In such oases men contradict each other in perfect
good faith. Their perception is be numbed.
The Dreamer .
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A dreamer lay in a land of flowers
And scarcely stirred as the hours flew by;
For bees hummed ever amid the bowers,
And the locust chanted drowsily ;
And the dreamer dreamed of a thousand towers
With golden turrets against the sky.
What if, away in the fields of grain,
The reapers worked and the sun beat down ?
Poor worms ! they toiled while his busy brain
Had built great ships and a white-walled town—
Had been with crowds who would shout again
To deck his name with a world’s renown.
What if, away on the dusty road,
A band of mourners drew slowly nigh.
And a weary man had laid down his load
In the race of life ? As the bier passed by
The dreamer smiled, for his dream-land showed
A nation mourning when he must die.
But the air grew chill, and a last late bee
Flew over his head on its homeward way,
And a breeze came up from the far-off sea
And stirred his hair ; it was thin and grey;
And a spectral shape stole silently
Adown the lane where the dreamer lay.
The dreamer spoke : “ I must rouse me soon ;
I have worlds to win—I have much to do;
I have only slumbered an afternoon
While the day was warm and the skies wew
blue.
And a bed of grasses, with roses strewn,
Brought scented sleep as the swift hours flew.”
But Death stood waiting amid the flowers :
“ What canst thou show for thy life ? ” he said,
41 A fair dream oity with golden towers ! ”
Then touched him once on the brow and fled.
The bees were dumb in the jasmine bowers,
And the dreamer slept with the unknown dead.

THANE.
The second reading of the Adult Suffrage
Bill was hung up for several days in the S.A.
Assembly because % member had gone amissing,
and the most energetic search failed to bring him
to light. His vote was needed to make up the
Constitutional majority of 28. Strange stories are
told about the places which the whip ransacked in
his vain search for that lost member, and the
houris whom he met in the course of his investiga-
tion, and the language that he heard, and the
weird drinks that he encountered. Finally, the
absentee turned up, and refuted the dark sus-
picions against him by proving that he wasn’t in
any of the places where his party had been looking
for him.

•‘Evert man can write at least one book,” every
man with brains has at least one good story to
tell; every man with or without brains moves in
a different eirole and knows things unknown to
any other man. Write carefully and plainly on
one side of the paper only, obliterating every un-
necessary word; then mail your work to The
Bulletin, which pays for accepted matter. In
certain of the so-called prize-competitions the
great prizes fall to the newspaper-proprietor, who
gets the guileless public to work for him for noth-
ing. Short stories, or ballads, especially on bush,
mining, sporting, social, or dramatic themes, are
preferred by The Bulletin ; 1360 words go to a
column. If you .can' possibly keep your story
within a column all the better Don’t write a
column on any subject if a half-column will do ;
don’t write half-a-column where a mere paragraph
is enough. “ Boil it down.”
Suggestions for illustration with or without
rough explanatory drawings will be gladly re-
ceived bv The Bulletin.
