S.A. Gypsum, a division of C.S.R. Co. Ltd.,
engaged in Gypsum Quarrying at Kangaroo
Island, South Australia, uses three 122 H.P.
WABCO/LWI6 Series rubber-tyred tractors for
overburden removal at their Salt Lake deposits
and dozing duties at Ballast Head.
Their preference for. these rugged and highly
manoeuvrable tractors has paid off in a big way.
The WABCO/LWl6’s are stockpiling and loading
washed and crushed Gypsum at Ballast Head,
working an average of 3.5 tons per pass on a
200 ft. lead, and have raised the original conveyor
loading design capacity of 400 tons to 575 tons
per hour.
This successful application is another example
of the versatility, reliability and Profitable per-
formance being obtained by WABCO/LWI6R users
around Australia and overseas.

WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’66 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown *
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’66
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963
at Coonawarra was
unusually humid, which
seems to have added
subtlety to the wine, giving
it greater delicacy, yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove
to be the best Australian
Hermitage ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’6O Cabernet
Made entirely from the rare
Cabernet Sauvignon grape,
this Cabernet was matured at
the Estate for two years in
oak and then further bottle-
maturedfor four years before
being released for sale. With
a pronounced Cabernet nose,
this wine is full and soft on
the palate, with a firm tannin
finish.
Modbury Estate
’65 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’65 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar. es

MORE THAN ONE newspaper has
been saying that Ray Milland is
the first Oscar-winner to set foot on
a Sydney stage. Has Nobody Here
Heard of Katharine Hepburn? Or
Laurence Olivier? Or Vivien Leigh?
Warning
FLYING SAUCERS are so common-
place that no one would be surprised
to see one landing outside any Town
Hall. But Adelaide’s “flashing white
light, visible for more than one hour”
requires comment. After many alarmed
phone calls an RAAF spokesman said it
was part of a Weapons Research Estab-
lishment experiment. No further ex-
planation. Surely the W.R.E. has heard
of that simple public warning device
—radio?
"Guidelines"
THE LATEST PRESS release from
Territories says the Australian Govern-
ment accepted the 1963 recommenda-
tions of an International Bank .mission
as guidelines for Papua-New Guinea’s
development. We don’t dispute it, only
wonder at the speed with which the
new words spread. Last month, every-
thing was being adjudged “viable.”
This month everyone is following
“guidelines.” But while being brisk and
so “mod,” Territories also says “con-
siderable progress has been made in
implementing them.”

WHEN MAI ZETTERLING’S notori-

In the interval, records of Miss

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Morley's Moomba:
a king for
all occasions
ACTUALLY we were awfully decent
to Robert Morley. The last time he
was here he said Melbourne was a
boring, unpainted town with bad
roads. Methylated spirit drinkers lay
around the stage door, our drinking
habits were horrid, and he added: “I
don’t care for Melbourne people be-
cause they are all spineless.”
Even now his comments on Mel-
bourne lack a little in devoted warmth.
“Oh, yes, I prefer Sydney. It is a
very pretty place. No doubt Melbourne
has all sorts of hidden charms and
graces, but somehow they escape me.
You all live in little boxes that look
exactly the same and they go on for
eternity ... I don’t know what to do
all day in Melbourne without poker
machines.”
Yet, despite that, we made the man
the King of Moomba. The week he
arrived he asked a reporter: “What’s
Moomba?” The answer was: “A festi-
val for getting together and having
fun.”
“Well, I’m all for that, darling,” he
replied. “I’m quite prepared to be
King of Moomba if you want me.”
You must appreciate that always we
have been rather overloaded with
queens but for 12 years we have been
king-less. Don Ingersole, the Moomba
director, didn’t hesitate. He rushed up
to the Comedy Theatre, opened a side
door, stepped into the darkness, and
fell seven feet into a pit back-stage,
very nearly breaking a leg' and a
shoulder. Morley wasn’t performing at
the Comedy but at the Princess. But,
later on meeting the injured Ingersole,
Morley graciously accepted.
Your correspondent has been follow-
ing the new King for the past few days
and he can give some direct quotes.
“Of course, being a King is nothing
new to me. I am always playing Kings.
I have been Louis XII, Louis XIV,
and Louis XV. I was playing one of
the Louis one time and they had a
Coronation. The robes were enormous
and I didn’t see the point in dressing
up in tights, so I left my grey flannel
trousers on underneath. It took all
day to get ready for the big scene and
as I was going up the aisle I exposed a
leg of my grey flannel bags. So they
had to shoot the whole thing again.
They were furious with me.
“Oh, and I was George 111 in
‘Quentin Durward.’ He was the mad
one, wasn’t he? I spent most of the
time running round, utterly mad, in
my nightie. This was a Command Per-
formance film. The Queen saw it and
didn’t like it a bit. Put her off Com-
mand Performances for a long time.
“I suppose for next Moomba they
will get one of these dreadful kitchen-
sink type actors to play the King. It
won’t be any good, they really need an
actor of the old school like me, who
understands royalty, to play the part.”
King Morley was so right. Dressed
up in his Moomba crown and ermine
trimmed robe, with sceptre and all, he
looked precisely like George 111, and
even better than Louis XIV. When
Moomba officials first presented him
with a crown he said: “Take that
away, it’s too tatty. Get me a better
one.” So a better crown had to be
made.
His other stipulation was that he
should travel in the procession with
the Moomba Queen, Miss Patsy Ann
Earp. On the Moomba Wednesday,
King Morley and Queen Patsy both
went to the Bendigo races. Patsy went
to present the Moomba Cup, Morley to
make money.
At Bendigo the committee asked if
they travelled up together. “No,” said
Morley, “you must appreciate I am
the King, she is the Queen. Therefore
we must always travel in separate air-
craft. If anything happened to the
both of us at once Moomba would be
ruined.” Actually he was almost ruined
himself. He lost on every race.
He backed Magic Actor in the first,
he thought Royal Performance a
natural in the third, and he plunged
on “My Edward” in the next. “How

could it fail after the success of my
play ‘Edward My Son’?” It failed
indeed, and on the way home he said:
“Losing at the races always makes me
humble and profoundly thoughtful.”
In the Moomba procession King
Morley rode in an open car at the head
with Queen Patsy Ann at his side. The
reporters asked if they could have a
picture of the King with his arm
around the Queen.
“Certainly not,” said Morley. “It is
not right for royal persons to give
demonstrations of affection in public.
We leave that to Snowdon and Meg.”
The police gave a crowd estimate of
800,000 watching the procession. If
this seems a somewhat exaggerated
estimate, there was certainly a remark-
able number of people there. They
were on awnings, on tops of traffic
lights, on tops of railway signals, and
a small boy was even sitting on the
railway clock.
King Morley said: “I am very happy
with the house. Would it be all right
to charge them threepence a head. I
think it is the greatest crowd to turn
out for royalty since Haile Selassie. And
they do seem to like me, don’t they?
I mean isn’t it marvellous to be able
to travel through Melbourne like this
wdthout security men, no personal body-
guards.”
And he was rather a magnanimous
ruler this time. There were few caustic
remarks. Only these. Marching girls:
“Yes, I saw them for the first time in
New Zealand, and I was agog. I
couldn’t believe it. They drilled all day
Saturday and all day Sunday. What
on earth for? I was once in the cadet
corps and I loathed it.”
Moomba decorations: “I would say
they were skilfully done wdth great
economy and monotony.”
Flinders St. station: “It looks as if
they were setting out to build St.
Paul’s then suddenly changed their
minds, realising they had to do it on
the opposite corner.”
Swanston St.: “Haven’t they chosen
the route well? This street has the
brewery at one end and the Shrine at
the other. It is really a saga of Aus-
tralian life.”
Morley as King waved to his sub-
jects. It was a slow wave, as if he were
patting his subjects upon the head. In
return, he said: “I received three types
of greeting, very vigorous waves,
languid waves and, finally, uncom-
promising stares of complete disbelief.
I think I liked those best. Some people
just roared but it was difficult to know
whether they were loving me or shout-
ing sedition.”
Regal Morley found being King of
Moomba not only splendid publicity
but most enjoyable. “I liked it,” he
said. “I could have gone on doing it
for hours. And it is not very arduous
being a King. I now propose to put
an advertisement in ‘The Times.’ Any
town, city, hamlet, or country that
needs a King will find me available.”

Lost in
a whirl of
glorious hats
AND WHAT is going on in the hat
world this Easter?
In the world of Henriette Lamotte,
which is on the sth floor of St. James
Building in Sydney’s Elizabeth Street,
next door to a cinema, her customers
were zooming into the salon, unable to
leave without buying something. On
the other hand, whereas they used to
buy six or seven hats a year, they are
now buying only two or three.
This clash of facts needed explana-
tion and Madame Lamotte gave it in
her fast, broken Australian (she is
French and married to the Count
D’Espinay). The reason why her cus-
tomers buy fewer hats: “Ze hairs, ze
awful, terrible hairs . . . they won’t
cover ze hairs up.”
This was understandable, we sug-
gested, when a woman has spent $lOO
on a false piece or wig. She is not go-
ing to hide it with another $55 worth
of diamante or felt. Well, not only ze
hairs, then. Sydney, which is not as hat-
conscious as it should be. Or used to
be. Melbourne, now, is different.
Women there recognise a hatty occasion
when they see one.
By way of consolation, Madame
Lamotte runs a boutique of clothes, the
source of which she jealously guards,
releasing only the information that they
are made by people who make for the
Paris couture boutiques. The day we
called, she was up to her eyes ordering
the summer 1968 batch, assisted by
her secretary, Miss Lumb (as in plum,
she explained), and Mrs. Sharp, who,
for one terrible moment, took us for a
customer. “No, no,” cried Madame
“she is ze presse!” Mrs. Sharp’s attitude
changed instantly.
We examined some clothes for a bit,
noted (1) that rain-cum-evening coats
were going for about $2OO, and (2)
Madame’s optimism that they’d all go
for sure; then with difficulty guided her
back to the hat track.
It can take two or three days to
make a hat completely: making the
basic hat-shape is what takes so long.
She buys the originals from Paris (or,
rather, an agent buys them for her),
then either sells them for, say, $63 or
copies them and sells for, say, $55. A
mink hat, of which there are many on
the market this Easter, might cost $l2O
or it might cost $9O, depending on

skins. Mink is so popular because
everyone knows it is all right.
She buys hats from Lanvin, Nibart,
and Paulette, but rarely from Jean
Barthet. “Him and his ugly cloches, al-
ways ze cloches.” She gave a downward
tug to her ears and made a face as if
pulling the cloche over her eyes. “But I
talk of ze fashion! Look in-
dicating her button-through navy dress,
“I am ze old how do you say
dccordienne?” Concertina, murmured
Miss Lumb, helpfully.
At this point, Madame Lamotte un-
burdened herself of the information that
having spent umpteen years in St.
James Building, where she has 22
workers toiling in 35,000 square feet,
she was now looking for pastures new.
Exactly where is a sworn secret, but
as a substitute, if we came back to-
morrow, she would let us be the first to
see what was due for summer 1968.
We returned, then, in 152 points of
rain, removed our imported (Wigan,
England) 50c plastic sou’wester and in-
spected next year’s boutique offerings.
The nicest ones came from a new de-
signer, whose name Madame Lamotte
didn’t know for the simple reason that
her agent had forgotten to write it
down. Between appreciative murmurs,
we elicited some more hat facts.
That, for instance, Madame might
buy 60 original hats from Paris and
out of this find only ten copiable
if she is lucky. She knows at a glance
what will sell and what will go into
her Sale.
As for Pierre Cardin’s space-age hats,
they are nothing short of horrible.
Twenty years ago, said Madame La-
motte, a hat was doing something for
someone, but today it does nothing.
Then was the Golden Time. Madame
Suzy, from whom she learnt her craft
in Paris, was alive, and what a genius!
She made little berets with elastic at
the back and they all fitted everyone
immediatement. Not like today when
some customers, depending on their
mood, needed four or five fittings. Ah,
if only she could show us those hats . . .
To everyone’s amazement, Miss Lumb
said she could. She vanished into the
office and after a few minutes returned
clutching to her Bosom a huge card-
board box marked “OLD HATS. PRE-
CIOUS. NEVER GIVE AWAY.” In-
side, dusty and crumpled, lay the very
hats Madame referred to: little berets,
large plates, a couple of cartwheels,
all with the Madame Suzy visible-to-
the-eye, guaranteed -to - fit - all - heads,
elastic-anchoring device.
Miss Lumb gave a splendid ex-
hibition of hat modelling as executed
in the Golden Time, and Madame
Lamotte said how they suited her. Had
Madame any pictures we might use to
illustrate this Golden Time? Yes, she
had. But alas, they were old newspaper
photographs stuck in her cuttings book.
We can only report, then, that in
a flashback feature through the ’4os
and ’sos Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere, in a
side-swept concoction laden with lovely
roses, looked absolutely magnificent.

SPORT
From a tired
old sport
to vital new
WHAT SPORT do you think could be
changed from today’s shambles to your
sons’ favorite tomorrow? Would you
believe boxing? No one could blame
you if that seemed far-fetched.
Boxing has taken the full count in
Australia. Stadiums Ltd. might as well
make it official by observing two
minutes’ silence at the next pop con-
cert or rassling exhibition at Sydney
Stadium and Festival Hall, Brisbane.
This would be only a courtesy cere-
mony to allow the one or two remain-
ing enthusiasts to fling wreaths in the
ring as the bell tolls ten and out.
Those who still scour the newspapers
for boxing news may point out that
a fight did take place, Brisbane way,
last Friday night (or was due to at
the time this page was written). It was
a highlight in Australian ring history,
a match between welterweight Graham
Dicker and a light-heavyweight (spot-
ting a mere two stones) at Redcliffe
Showground.
There is no Commission to ban
such a match, nor the equally dubious
one which trainer Reg Layton and
former boxer Wally Taylor plan to
promote at Ipswich on March 31
between Ray Perez, who came here as
a flyweight, and Noel Kunde, last heard
of as a featherweight, a one-stone
weight difference. Good little men can
beat good big men, but as none of the
gentry mentioned above is a brilliant
boxer, the dangers are apparent.
Not even an elephant trained in
Pelmanism could remember the last
boxing match at Sydney Stadium,
home of pachydermous “rasslers,”
roller skaters, and pop musicians.
Rocky Gattellari is back, and doubt-
less Stadium manager Harry Miller
has the names of ten flyweights or
bantamweights ready to mention as
possible opponents, including the world
champion, Chionoi, of Thailand. This
will result in ten small news items, but
it will not necessarily lead to any
matches.
That leaves Melbourne as the only
city where the fight game is still alive.
It has bantam champion Lionel Rose,
who has had his first fight in four
months against Italian Nevio Carbi,
and our featherweight champion
Johnny Famechon, who recently
tumbled his Italian equivalent in two
rounds before a capacity crowd (for
Melbourne) of 7000.
Here are some interesting facts: a
Melbourne TV attempt to run a
boxing show failed badly in the only
city where boxing still rates. Similar
shows featuring clowns and fakes, the
rasslers and roller skaters, have been
wild successes. Even the Sydney clubs
have ditched the boxers, but use
rasslers. There is overwhelming evi<T
ence that the public no longer wants
boxing any more than it wanted honest
wrestling after Gotch and Hacken-
schmidt spent hours in a sitting posi-
tion trying to break each other’s legs.
There are many things the modern
public does not like about boxing, most
of all the slugging match which is still
the norm. The fight crowd always
loved a bloodbath. Today, that crowd
is so small it doesn’t matter. The blood
sport of boxing is finished.
Cassius Clay sensed it and became
a clown as well as a great boxer. His
success could lead lesser boxers to
emulation and the sport to fakery. The
alternative would be to make honest
boxing more attractive to all but the
“have a go” shouters, and to the
athletes with too much intelligence to
have their brains scrambled.
Two near fatalities, Jack Haines’
and Vic Patrick’s, sickened men of
screaming for a knockout. Women who
never did see any sense in boxing’s
brutalities, influenced the male view-
point further. If the sport had ceased
long ago to be equated with animal
fighting, and had changed its emphasis
from thuggery to speed and skill, it
might be alive.
In retrospect, if boxing had fol-
lowed Young Griffo’s or Jack Carroll’s
way, it would have lost thousands of
followers but gained thousands of
others, would have been encouraged in
schools, where it is now impossible, and
could have become king of sports
instead of rag-tag.
The “on-the-point” knockout is a
myth. Most KOs are simply concus-
sion from a blow that rattles the brain,
or the last of a series of blo\ys. In
attempting a knockout it is equally
easy to damage the optic or auditory
nerves. Headguards are no protection.
Make the knockout an immediate
fight-loser, and any hard punch to the
head a points-detractor; protect the
ears, eyes, and nose with a light head-
guard; and put the emphasis where
it properly belongs, and we would
have a fine sport once again.
That emphasis should be on speed
and skill in the interplay between two
well-conditioned athletes equipped
with two arms and hands and. good
bodily reflexes. That kind of boxing
would be a shadow play of brutality,
but a good test of, and developer of,
the instant thinking and perfect reflex

CELLAR
MASTER
Delicacy from
a high and
windy hill
IN MY BOOK, “Cellarmaster’s Guide
to Australian Wines” (available at all
leading lending libraries), I mentioned
the Gramps Steingarten vineyard and
the Yalumba Pewsey Vale vineyard.
Both of these are comparatively new
and we are waiting, breath baited, for
the first commercial results.
But first some explanation. The
German pioneers settling the Barossa
Valley (or New Silesia as it was
originally called) naturally turned to
their known famous variety of grape,
the Rhine Riesling, to make white
wines. Along the Rhine and its
tributaries these grapes grow on the
mountain slopes and the ones from
the top sections facing south are
generally regarded as among the best
for making top quality wine.
In the Barossa Valley today, most
of these Rhine Rieslings are centred
on the undulating foothills of the
Barossa Range. The hot weather
during the ripening stage means that
you get a fuller, somewhat bigger, style
of wine than those made in Germany.
In 1953, when Gramps produced their
first pressure and controlled fermenta-
tion Rhine Riesling, they made wines
of considerably more delicacy and
character than had been made before.
And yet, somehow, this wasn’t
enough. As the wines got better and
better as more and more makers used
this process, it was realised that more
attention had to be given to the vines.
To get the crispness which comes from
relatively high acidity, you have to pick
the grapes before they are fully ripe
if they are grown in a relatively low-
lying area.
Ergo, if you plant your grapes
higher they will ripen more slowly
in the colder altitude, getting full
benefit of the sun whilst retaining their
crisp acidity. Theoretically, you will
then finish up with a perfect acid/
sugar balance with all the marvellous
flavors and characters inherent in the
Rhine Riesling grape in full flower.
So Gramps went marching up the
hill and established, under incredibly
difficult conditions, two acres of vine-
yard on rolling sheep country over-
looking the Valley. This area is
approximately 800 feet higher than the
old original Rhine Riesling vineyards
at Rowland Flat and is actually 1600
feet above sea-level. The soil, rocky in
nature, consists of a soft type of rock
known as Schist rock. This had to be
broken, first mechanically, and then
with the old-fashioned stone hammer.
Holes had to be specially prepared
to get the stakes for the vines in. The
usual trellis was discarded and the
vines are individually basket-pruned
around each stake. Each vine stands
only 4 feet down and across from its
neighbors. Consequently, there are 2760
vines per acre as against the normal
500 or so. And because the bunches are
extremely tight and small, it will un-
doubtedly be a bastard to pick.
But so far, not even a trace of
illegitimacy has appeared. They col-
lected a few bunches in 1965; the
quantity was minute, but indicated that
the experiment would be worth while.
The ’66 crop was damaged by hail;
the quality was wonderful.
Another difficult vintage appears to
be imminent because the weather con-
ditions have been adverse and the grapes
are far from ripe at this stage. Every-
thing finishing in a blaze of heat and
glory, Gramps will still finish up with
only 500 bottles of wine from the vine-
yard this year.
Yalumba, not far away at Pewsey
Vale, in the shadow of the Kaiser Stuhl
■ — the mountain, not the winery that
sits on the flat—have the perhaps less
romantic but far bigger venture under
way. At present they have 120-odd
acres of vines planted, most of which
are Rhine Riesling. I drove up there
last month along the top of the Eden
Valley to have a look at this develop-
ment. Half-way along the winding
dirt road we were shrouded in mist. In
February!
The vines are contour planted. Mostly
on sandy loam with rocky outcrops
(in fact the very location of the vine-
yard depends on the amount of rock
outcrop) and on the high and windy
hill it’s a most impressive sight. The
grapes three weeks ago were so green
and tart that they were inedible. Ripen-
ing in hoped-for ideal conditions, they
will result in wines of extreme delicacy
and flavor with clean and crisp acid.
The Pewsey Vale vineyards are at
1800 feet and are most individual. You
get this feeling of remoteness, of away-
from-it-all-ness, a quiet waiting of man
for nature to fulfil its work. Both
Rhine Riesling wines from these areas
must be of great quality. They will
just have to be after all this trouble.
In 1840, when Johann Menge wrote
to George Fife Angas, he said, “I am
quite certain that we shall see flourish-
ing vineyards and orchards and im-
mense fields of corn throughout New
Silesia.” In 1847 Joseph Gilbert, after
making a special survey at Pewsey Vale,
planted one acre of vines. The grape?
Rhine Riesling. Unfortunately they
were becalmed in the table wine dol-
drums, and cattle and sheep took over.
But once more we are shown the
astonishing foresight of the early
settlers of Australia.

AUSTRALIA
Parliament: a promise
of “committees with teeth”
AS A PIECE of social machinery the
Commonwealth Parliament moves
slowly at the best of times. Sometimes
it grinds to a halt. The 183 well-paid
workers do process a goodly quantity
of verbal fuel to fire the democratic
process, but even they agree that the
quality of the product is not what it
should be.
Lacking any systematic opportunity
to specialise, and lacking research assis-
tance, Parliamentarians are hack
jacks of every trade, from the buffalo
fly in Cape York to the automation
problems of the Redfern mail
exchange.
During the first session of the 26th
Parliament, they spent most of their
time and energy in going through the
slow parliamentary motions, consum-
ing hundreds of expensive manhours
in voting divisions which were foregone
conclusions and many thousands in
flogging old issues predictably.
The range of subjects covered was
pretty typical. In four weeks the House
of Representatives heard a full-scale
debate on the Government’s overall
policies contained in the Governor-
General’s speech; a major debate on
Mr. Hasluck’s foreign affairs state-
ment; plus small debates on new tariff
measures, the Bill establishing the De-
partment of Education and Science;
and there was a full range of griev-
ance and adjournment speeches on sub-
jects of members’ choosing.
A rough analysis of subjects covered
indicates members' pre-occupations.
Vietnam was by far the biggest issue,
treated at length 37 times in 16 sitting
days. There w'ere just a few new lines
taken. At last Australia has a real
“hawk" in Sir Wilfred Kent Hughes
who advocated an invasion of North
Vietnam.
Dr. Mackay was one of several
members to speak in general terms of
a "peril within” as great as the exter-
nal defence threat: “Let us make no
mistake, there are increasing signs in
our own land still slight thank God
of practices and philosophies which
are no more desirable, in my book,
than those of Mao Tse-tung and Ho
Chi Minh.”
Mr. Duthie, Labor, insisted in an
impassioned speech that “The cynic
is a greater menace to this country
than the Communists are.” He argued.
“We cannot survive on cynicism. It is
barren, it is empty, it is callous.”
A number of Government back-
benchers argued for more economic aid
for Vietnam. The Opposition was pre-
dictable, its general line being de-
scribed in a colorful phrase by Mr.
Killen. “There are more ALP policies
on Vietnam than there are clumps
of Noogoora burr on the outer Barcoo.
But they all lead to one thing a
policy of scuttle.” Most ALP speakers
called for a unilateral and uncondi-
tional cessation of American bombing,
and the formation of a coalition Gov-
ernment in Saigon.
Problems of education, northern
development, minerals, foreign invest-
ment, the Boonaroo affair and social
services lagged well behind in tin-
debate. Only on the tariff policy was
new ground broken, with the Lal>or
Party abandoning its previous uncriti-
cal acceptance of the policies of Mr.
McEwen.
But just before the plant closed
down for a fortnight’s rest, there wen-
encouraging signs that something was
going to be done to enable parliamen-
tarians to deliver a better job of work.
Those most recently recruited
joined to strengthen the hand of ex-
perienced reformers, led by Mr. Harry
Turner, the Liberal backbencher from
Bradfield, to draw the Prime Minister
into a promise to seriously consider
committees - with - teeth,” something
letter than the statutory Committees
■ m Public Accounts and Government
Works, the tame-cat Standing Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs, and the oc-
casional specific subject committees
that already exist.
Crime
Bird smugglers
THE MAXIMUM fine of $lOOO for the
illegal export of Australian birds has
seldom been imposed. Perhaps the
present popularity of bird smuggling
would wane if it was. A father and sort
caught trying to board a plane for
Kuala Lumpur accompanied by 47 par-
rots were recently fined $lO9. If their
gamble had paid off they could have
sold these birds for $25,000. A parrot
worth $8 can be sold for $250 overseas.
Finches cost $6 here, fetch $lOO else-
where.
The smugglers deal almost exclusively
in parrots and finches —they are pretty,
colorful, seed-fed (insect-fed birds are
harder to care for), and aviary bred,
which means they are tractable and
resigned to being caged. The young
birds are bought here, from reputable
dealers, sometimes 100 at a time. The
bedraggled birds are stuffed into boxes,
overnight bags, and portmanteaus. Their
tail feathers are cut off at the base.
They are disinclined to cheep, and al-
though a few are inevitably smothered
or trodden to death, most survive.
One enterprising business man de-
clared a case full of domestic pigeons
(legal exports). A Customs official with
a sixth sense investigated the seemingly
innocent case and found a secret com-
partment stuffed with parrots.


Empress
Very dry run
GETTING THERE is half the fun on
the Empress of Australia, but only for
non-smoking, non-drinking travellers
during the two nights and one day
crossing from Sydney to Tasmania. A
BULLETIN traveller last week
reported that there is no smoking in
the dining saloon, although it is air-
conditioned; you can’t have an after-
dinner drink, apart from liquers
with your coffee, for an hour after
dinner ends if you’re a “first-sitting”
man; you can’t get a drink after 10.30
p.m., you cannot buy a bottle to serve
yourself, and you are not allowed to
bring your own grog on board.
However, if you want to sit up,
playing cards or talking, on the first
two nights of your carefree Tasmanian
holiday, there is plenty of cool water
to go around.
Then there are other pinpricks from
a bluenosed management such as the
absurd rule that stewards can only
replace empty glasses; a group cannot
order another round of drinks while
there is a drop in a glass in front of
one of them, no matter how long it
will take the steward to get back to you
through the crowded room.
But if you try hard you can enjoy
yourself; the milk shakes are very good.
Students
Current affairs
THE CURRENT “current affairs
bulletin,” dated March 13, subject "The
University Student 1967,” is quite a
swinger, from its lower-case front page
title plate to its pop usage (“the
campus would have done a Van
Winkle”), its scattering of Gary Shead
cartoons and coy footnotes such as “M.
Reynolds: Little Boxes” to mark a
quote from the song of that name.
The author, left unnamed, but con-
stantly described as “the writer” is “a
well-known figure in student life, and
outside it, as student politician, con-
ference delegate, publicist, and contro-
versialist.” He lives up to his billing
from the word “go”: “if N.S.W. is
‘The Tech.,’ Monash is the Discotech.
This is the go-go ca,mpus which has
spawned Australia’s most successful pop
weekly ‘Go Set,’ and is also the swing-
ing centre of the Melbourne demon-
stration biz.”
Despite his frantic attempts to be
“with it,” the author packs plenty of
Empress of Australia
facts, figures, and the meat of con-
troversy into his 13 pages. This may
be the new policy for C.A.B. (the
March 27 issue will feature “Vietnam —
anti-Commitment”). It is likely to
draw' some pointed comment from Mr.
C. R. Badger, director of Victoria’s
Council of Adult Education, who does
not think that the University of Syd-
ney’s participation in adult education
via the C.A.8., even in its more staid
moments, is valid, anyw'ay.
Perth
Rabbits
AT A TIME w'hen myxo,matosis has
made it rare indeed to run over a
rabbit on the roads, they are popping
up in the most unlikely places—for
example, Perth’s King’s Park, the 1000-
acre bushland park in the heart of the
western capital.
They threatened plans for creating
a botanic garden of native plants, by
nibbling away at the seedlings. The
only answer ex-South African park
director Dr. J. S. Beard could turn up
was to poison them. A 10-mile trail
of baits w'as laid, notices went out to
remind park walkers to keep domestic
pets clear, and the rabbits fell for it.
The first casualty list—sl plump pre-
dators.
Natural gas
Four States
FOUR STATES are plunging ahead
(some of their critics say, recklessly)
with plans to cash in on the benefits of
natural gas. Premiers of three of them,
Queensland, Victoria, and South Aus-
tralia, claim their capitals will be the
first to use the gas domestically. The
most clamant claimant is Victoria’s
Sir Henry Bolte, who says, “There is
enough gas (in the Bass Strait fields)
to supply Victoria, N.S.W., or any
interstate demands that may come.’’
Too bad if fields are discovered in or
off N.S.W.
“Natural gas in your kitchen in two
years’ time,” seems the general promise,
with Brisbane most likely to deliver
first. Its gas will be piped from the
Roma field along a 300-mile pipeline
already begun by Associated Pipelines
Ltd. (Associated Oil plus Southern
Union Gas of Texas), which plans to
supply the South Brisbane Gas Co. by
late 1968, and the $4O million fertiliser
plant a consortium will build on the
Brisbane River.
Victoria and South Australia intend
to keep their pipelines in Government
hands, and each has begun to set up a
pipeline authority. Victoria’s (a Com-
mission) had its first meeting this
month, when the chairman said the
pipeline would be finished before 1968
was out, and carry gas into Melbourne
early in 1969. Esso-BHP will transport
the gas to Sale, where “unwanted pro-
ducts” will be extracted before the clean
gas goes 112 miles underground to a
point near Melbourne. Pipeline cost:
$2O million.
How the Victorian gas will get to
N.S.W., at what cost, and when, are
all question marks. Sydney’s Australian
Gas Light Co. says it will spend $47
million on conversion to use natural
gas, but whose is in the lap of the gods.
South Australia’s Pipeline Authority
exists on paper and will be set up if or
when the Moomba and Gidgealpa fields
can produce enough natural gas. The
owners (Santos and Delhi) say they
can, for at least 20 years. Before nego-
tiating further the Government expects
them to drill more wells and prove their
reserves. If they can't, it may buy from
Victoria, eventually; unless, as is likely,
a find similar to the Bass Strait one
occurs on the Otway Shelf. Despite
all “ifs,” Premier Walsh says a pipeline
will be delivering gas to Adelaide within
two years, if not to the Gulf cities,
Pirie and Augusta.
Finally, Western Australia’s Ampol
is planning to pipe gas to the main-
land from its Barrow Island wells, but
the plans so far seem less grandiose,
than the other States’.
The usual cliche applies. Natural
gas will be a tremendous boon to Aus-
tralia, in time. But early in 1967, when
not one cubic foot has advanced beyond
the well heads, it is really too soon to
say as much as some Premiers are
saying. No one outside Brisbane, in all
of sparsely settled Australia, has proved
that it will attract or be useful to
industry, nor even that it will lower the
household gas bill. These are the facts
people seek when that other form of
natural gas, the lordly generalities, have
lifted all the States’ and companies’
balloons into the stratosphere.
The Commonwealth has been rela-
tively silent, merely providing the
money, refereeing disputes over royal-
ties, and quite possibly seeing things
both nationally and rationally.


Canberra
The Archives
CANBERRA’S NATIONAL Capital
Development Commission lavishes its
attentions heavily on the area it calls
the Parliamentary Triangle. Bounded
by two divided thoroughfares, set
around the lake and containing the
main parliamentary and department
buildings, it is the heart of the capital.
Yet in the middle of this grand area,
on the edge of the lake, prominently
positioned, is a hideous little mess.
Three old wartime Nissen huts joined
by a portholed pink brick facade lie
right across one of Walter Burley
Griffin’s ceremonial axes, which runs
from the American war memorial ajid
the white-marbled defence buildings
across magnificent Kings Avenue
Bridge to Capitol Hill.
This bizarre little building houses
the main collection of the Common-
wealth Archives, 50,000 shelf feet of
the key records of the Commonwealth
of Australia. It is now the subject of
fiercely expressed complaints by Aus-
tralian historians, for whom it is the
principal repository of much potential
source material.
For instance, Dr. Neville Meaney,
a senior lecturer in History at Sydney
University, last week told THE BUL-
LETIN: “After the British Govern-
ment opened its archives to the end
of 1922 and '‘ announced its intention
of adopting a $O-year rule, I sought
permission to examine Australian post-
World War I records. I received
no reply. When I then visited the'
Archives I was told they did not
answer letters, had no staff for it.
“I was also told that no student
could see any file before 1922 until
it had first been seriously examined by
the Archivist. This might take three
months or more. From my own know-
ledge I know that this is not American
or British practice.”
Officials in Canberra said that no one
had any right to demand to see depart-
mental documents younger than 1922,
but could be shown them at the discre-
tion of departmental heads.
We also learned that “open access”
for papers older than 1922 is not quite
what it says. Documents in this cate-
gory may be withheld, too, and the
three-month waiting period is required
for their clearance. Documents which
might contain embarrassing or libellous
personal references to persons still liv-
ing, or which may be offensive to their
relatives, are sifted out.
The Archives staff comprises four pro-
fessional archivists aided by six records
specialists and 20 clerical assistants. The
Chief Archivist is a lowly ranking “816”
officer, in the middle of the Third
Division of the public service, with a
salary maximum of $6560.
The office manages departmental
records from the time they are two
years old in the case of the Customs
Department, five years in the case of
Prime Minister’s, to 25 for External
Affairs. Its main function is therefore
modern records management. It lends
out more than a quarter of a million
files to the various departments each
year, and receives probably twice as
many telephone queries.
Historical work gets second priority,
though there are currently more than
100 scholars working on the premises,
including people like Sir Robert
Menzies and J. J. Dedman. The less
fortunate are sometimes told that there
will be a delay of six months before they
can be helped.
Margaret Smith
Little tennis
WHILE YOU are enjoying the Easter
holiday, and Australia’s men tennis
players are earning that $lOO-$ 1000 a
week wherever it is they go this time
of the year, Margaret Smith will be
coaching in Broome, Kununurra, and
Port Hedland.
Since retiring from the “go, go, go”
of international tennis her only appear-
ances have been in Perth, and for one
night at Naremburn courts in Sydney.
Miss Smith is an unpredictable
woman. 1966, her seventh year in big
tennis, was one of her worst. She re-
turned ho,me, saying first that she would
have a long rest from the game, and
in November that she had retired. A
London tennis writer commented, “The
tall Australian girl, quiet, shy, and
terribly modest, was far happier talking
to children or taking things quietly.”
Since her New Year MBE she has
been helping to coach younger Perth
players and looking after her boutique.
Lately W.A.’s National Fitness Council
asked her to tour over Easter for its
North Corps, which is to take sporting
people and entertainers on brief tours
of developing towns in the State’s north,
to establish sports and cultural activities.
After that, her future is anyone’s
guess. Ours would be that she will re-
turn to “big” tennis eventually. She is
only 24.
Electricity
Drop-out fuses
WHEREVER ELECTRICITY is dis-
tributed by overhead wire there is
danger that birds might cause a bush-
fire. This can happen when the bird (or
an animal, even an insect) bridges
conductors and falls burning to the
ground or causes a short circuit which
blows out fuses, variously known as
breaker, drop-out, or throw-out, which
can drop fragments of hot metal to
earth. Last week the W.A. Country
Shire Councils Association raised the
question of “bush arson by kooka-
burras,” and asked its SEC to do some-
thing about it.
We can report that most SECs in
Australia have been working on \he
problem, and that one solution is in
sight. They would have preferred new
fuses made of some combustible ele-
ment, such as magnesium, which would
have burned out instead of throwing
or dropping-out. The alternative was a
basket-like device which would catch
the hot metal, and a Sydney firm,
D. E. Taplin and Co., is manufacturing
one for Australia-wide distribution. The
Electricity Supply Association of Aus-
tralia has informed all electricity supply
authorities of this, and the Victorian
SEC has ordered 25,000 to begin with.
It will not help the kookaburras or
other birds, nor stop the very few fires
they might start. But it will ease the
minds of farmers throughout Australia
who have long suspected that drop-out
fuses start fires.
However, there is doubt, and elec-
tricity supply authorities will spend
large amounts to eliminate it. The
basket devices cost about $l3 each, and
there are possibly several hundred
thousand of the fuses throughout this
continent. At, say, a minimum expendi-
ture of $1,300,000, these will be the
most protected and expensive “drop-
outs” in history.
Margarine
Slippery subject
WHILE THE dispute between Marrick-
ville Margarine (sponsors of ads featur-
ing Mrs. Jones, patriotic Australian)
and the N.S.W. Government (indirect
sponsors of ads featuring “Daisy,” said
to support 600,000 workers) continues
unabated, it might be worth noting
that W.A.’s two margarine, manufac-


Hirers will be allowed to increase
annual tonnage by 33 percent, from 600
to 800 tons.
In the West, the producers are
Meadow' Lea (increased to 499 tons)
and Unilever (301 tons), and they have
been allowed previous increases from
364 tons in 1940 to 600 tons in 1952.
Whether the W.A. move has anything
to do with N.S.W.’s attempt to stop
Marrickville from exporting interstate
or w'hether that is purely due to its
alleged “not servicing the public of
N.S.W.” is anyone’s guess. It’s a
slippery subject.
Tariffs
Tightrope
WHEN COUNTRY PARTY leader
and Trade Minister John McEwen
and Labor’s new Trade spokesman I)i
Jim Cairns clashed last week on tin
Government’s tariff policy, Cairns had
a lot on his side, including logic, bm
McEwen won hands down politically.
After McEwen had spoken, Labm
did not even dare to call on a vote fm
its amendment, w'hich McEwen
correctly in my view interpreted a-
a call to the Government to wipe on
certain industries, including one em-
ploying 1188 workers. Labor dared
not call for a physical division on it-
Wilsonian amendment, for a very good
reason. If it had been taken, a nuntbe:
of Labor parliamentarians (one chic!
tain estimated half the Party strength
would have walked out of the Chambei
of the House of Representatives ratlin
than vote for the Labor amendment.
Both McEwen and Cairns were
walking tightropes during the debate,
the first significant one that has taken
place in the Parliament on tariffs and
tariff policies for years. Both knew
their risky positions, with feelings
within their respective parties most
uneasy about the viewpoints being
espoused. Cairns had much on his side
when he advanced what was basically
the thesis that inefficient and unecon-
omic Australian industries should be
wiped out by withdrawal of the high
tariff protection behind which they
exist. Cairns had on his side logic,
individual Liberal and Country Party
members, the Commonwealth Treas-
ury (spiritually), and probably sound
economic theory.
Said Cairns: “It is for the Minister
for Trade to prove that there is no
better way to employ Australians than
in industry which is not economic,
which may never be, and which may
force up the cost of equipment such as
engines of 10 horsepower or less, fer-
tiliser for use by farmers, or food and
clothing for Australians all over the
nation. Employment is not endangered
by a less generous policy of tariff mak-
ing. Consider the 26 firms in the
chemical industry which employ be-
tween them 1188 people. This is not
an employment factor of any signifi-
cance.”
Then Cairns turned to two other in-
dustries, petro-chemicals and motor
vehicle manufacturing, one of the
largest employment fields in Australia.
“Is the petro-chemical industry in this
country obsolete?” Cairns asked. "The
Tariff Board's report (on it) leaves us
in doubt whether the chemical industry-
can be considered as economic and
efficient. The same position is apparent
in the motor-car industry. Ony very
large firm is producing cars at a very
high rate of profit. There are others
whose situation is not as satisfactory.
But in all cases the tariff seems de-
signed to meet the average, or the
higher cost of the industry, leaving
the more profitable firms in a position
to make what I regard as abnormal,
exploitative, and unreasonable profits.”
Having teetered dangerously far in
one direction on his tightrope, Cairns
then proceeded to straighten up by
McEwen: "I do not believe ...”
leaning the other way. “If there is no
way of employing men here rather
than overseas or of preventing un-
employment, then, as far as the Opposi-
tion is concerned, it is far better to
protect an inefficient and uneconomic
industry in this country than to allow
men to be out of work here, or to
allow' us to be short of investment.” But
having said that he immediately
teetered back the other way. “But this
is not the position today. The Minister
knows that this is not the position
today.”
But, politically, McEwen had on his
side a basic. Involved in this issue was
the bread and butter matter of jobs.
Said McEwen: "There is no group of
people in Australia so interested in
adequate tariff protection as the great
btdk of the Australian work force who
find their employment behind the shel-
ter of adequate tariffs. In all the
history of the Labor Party it has
boasted of its policy.of protecting Aus-
tralian industries. The Labor Party has
thrown its historic policy out the win-
dow and has moved in to attack pro-
tective tariffs. If Labor claims as its
exclusive role the protection of the
work force then it is extraordinary that
it should attack the main means by
which the work force is assured of its
employment.
“Capital amounting to $2OO million
is invested in the chemical industry.
That figure may be an under-
statement. But that means nothing to
the Socialist economist who says, fold
it up. One thousand people will lose
jobs but that is nothing. There are other
jobs they can get. Is this the real think-
ing of the Labor Party? I do not believe
that is what the Australian community
wants.’’
McEwen admitted that on occasion
a comparison of costs of Australian
industries with those overseas would
on a technical assessment show- local
ones to be ineffecient. But given
opportunity these industries had the
potential to become more efficient. Was
Australia to adopt a course by which
Cairns: "This is not the position!”
at some given moment of time and
on such an assessment there was to be
a ruthless withdrawal of protective
policy?
McEwen clearly won this round of
the fight, but it was only a preliminary
round. I feel tariff policies and tariff-
making machinery are going to be
among the big issues of this Parlia-
ment.

Last week, for instance, one daily head-

Sydney University over the new chap-

toward a controversy. The local

ing to explain the latest “recent pub-

Yet, many were wondering exactly
what was at stake: the resigning chap-

involved; somehow “freedom in the

people knew anything of a supposed

Catholics. The Pope has said: “For-

to discriminate between productive and

Trade
Wool packs
FOR FIFTY YEARS Australia has
bought 99 percent of its jute wool
packs from India. Last year we bought
$3 million worth. A jute pack weighs
141 b., and its short fibres become en-
tangled in the wool. These fibres defy
processing and have to be removed by
hand. Over the past few years the
Wool Board has been encouraging ex-
perimentation with synthetic packs, and
out of 30 different samples produced,
three have been labelled “promising."
Dalgety’s has just produced and sold
30,000 packs with a polythene base
to woolgrowers, and everyone will
watch their performance with great
interest, particularly the Indians, who
are naturally anxious to retain the Aus-
tralian market for jute. An Indian
delegation just completed a visit here
discussing the problems of wool packs.
The Indian Trade Commission says the
mission successfully offered a new,
lighter 31b. jute pack with a special lin-
ing to ensure that the wool does not
get contaminated.
It seems nobody envisages a com-
plete change from jute to polythene.
The synthetic pack does not contamin-
ate the wool it bales, but it is not
known yet how' it stands up to “the
system” packing, stacking, moving,
going through different machines, rail
travel, and so on. A change from one
covering to another would be an ex-
tremely complex undertaking, entailing
a tremendous amount of new mach-
inery. Indian jute packs are safe for
another three vears at least.
Housing
National
convention
WHETHER THE housing position
has improved “enormously” as claimed
by the Minister of National Develop-
ment, Mr. Fairbairn, or only “moder-
ately" as seen by the Housing Indus-
try Association is not as big a ques-
tion as whether more should be done
to get the slack in labor and material
available to the industry into use.
On a broad national conspectus it
looks as though much of these re-
sources are idle. In South Australia,
where the recovery in dwelling construc-
tion has hung fire, the percentage would
be highest; it would be less than 10
percent in Victoria, Western Australia,
and Tasmania, and about the average
in N.S.W. and the A.C.T.
On the straight question of resources
availability, the industry takes the view
that although percentage stands to be
reduced with the upswing more re-
sources will be freed for use by the con-
tinuing rundown of activity in office
building and new housing construction.
In the industry's view this makes the
need for new measures to help charm
resources into use the more urgent.
We are going to hear about such
measures next w'eek at the National
Housing Convention in Melbourne.
Questions range from the lowering of
interest rates and the bigger provision
and more enlightened direction of
Government money for housing on the
one hand, to the relaxation of existing
limits and ceiling for housing advances
by house lending agencies on the other.
One of the hottest proposals being
put up is to shore back the State
Government's cut of the Federal
housing advances ($l2O million this
year) being made under the Common-
wealth-State Housing Agreement to
give more lending money to private
societies and institutions. Another,
which was urged by G. M. Niall, chair-
man of the National Mutual Life
Association at the company’s annual
meeting last w'eek, is for the Govern-
ment to make taxation concessions on
interests on deposits made with per-
manent building societies, loans made
to co-operative building societies, and
deposits placed in with savings banks
for a minimum of five years. It does
so for interest on Commonwealth
Bonds, says Mr. Niall, so why not tax
concessions for housing finance media,
as in Britain, where, largely because of
them, the building societies have been
able to attract thousands of millions
of dollars in to housing.
Federal housing people won’t need
their hearing-aids to get the beat of
the industry’s big drum next week,
but Mr. McMahon may still have to
turn a deaf ear to them.
He doesn’t want a boom on his hands
nor open the gates to tax concessions.

COMMENT
Harold Holt’s light breeze of change
"I don't think they should advertise cigarettes
on TV, it interrupts the murders."
IN RETROSPECT MANY of the
critics of Sir Robert Menzies now seem
to have pardoned him. Now they use
their reassessment of Sir Robert as
a weapon against Mr. Holt.
If this were simply an expression of
our Australian “knocking” tradition
that anybody who rises to the top in
politics should automatically be dis-
trusted it could be applauded as a
healthy necessity of our democracy.
But it also expresses some of that im-
pulse toward conservatism that helps
keep the Australian Left as something
of a museum piece. It is a conservatism
that could also impede the more con-
temporary approach to politics of Mr.
Whitlam.
Mr. Holt’s winds of change have not
yet risen above a light breeze. And, as
Alan Reid suggests in our cover story
this week, when they do blow they
blow more strongly in the direction of
Asia than in domestic policy, perhaps
because, at the last election, that was
where the votes were to be won. But
this is nevertheless the most important
direction in which they can blow. It’s
an important start that Mr. Holt should
accept enthusiastically that we are
where we are on the map, and that he
should use himself to demonstrate our
interest in the nations of Asia by flying
off to them. His next step should be to
declare an Australian foreign policy
that, in general and perhaps even
emotional terms, made some sense to
the ordinary people of Australia be-
yond merely strategic considerations.
After that? Alan Reid seems to sug-
gest that while the Coalition Parties
are groping around looking for new
dynamics in domestic policies they may
be a bit ahead of Mr. Holt’s own rhink-
ing. It’s about time that Mr. Holt did
his own thinking or got others to
do it for him—about what the business
of government now is inside Australia.
His Government does seem to be
moving toward a view that Australian
investment should be used more crea-
tively in developing our own natural
resources. Mr. Holt should think this
out a bit more fully. Why is it that
while we have the money we don’t seem
to have the imagination or the brains
to use it to create some new activity?
Why do we leave it instead to foreign-
ers to show us the way? This is one of
Australia’s fundamental domestic prob-
lems: we seem to be a rather stupid lot
as we sit on our own wealth waiting for
others to show us what to do with it.
The problems here are so deep that
no single policy can solve them. Per-
haps there is something fundamentally
wrong with the world-view that our
education system casts into young
minds. Perhaps we are still in-
grained in the habits of provincial, or
even colonial, thinking. If this is so,
only shocks may jar us out of old ways.
Mr. Holt might do well to consider
whether some of his speech-making
should not be concerned with shocking
us into a new sense of reality.
What speech-making? It is here that
the invidious comparisons of Mr. Holt
with Sir Robert are most often made.
Even those who hated Sir Robert now
call on his memory to point to the
weaknesses of Mr. Holt in talking to
his fellow Australians and telling them
what he thinks his Government and
Australia itself is about. In one
sense the comparison is true. Sir Rob-
ert spoke very much better than Mr.
Holt, simply as a speech-maker. But he
spoke well about the wrong things. At
least as far as foreign affairs are con-
cerned, Mr. Holt is now speaking badly
about the right things.


An attitude of mind
HOLT'S
CANBERRA
BY ALAN REID
"Holt is clearly affected
by the need for new ideas"
IN THE SECOND YEAR of the politi-
cal reign of Prime Minister Harold
Holt, Canberra is a city in search of a
new purpose —so that it will know what
to do with itself.
In this city, where you cannot escape
political discussion even at the corner
store or when visiting a petrol pump,
there is now an uneasy feeling that the
dynamics which have brought Australia
prosperity, growth, and expansion in
the years since World War II are about
played out. Immigration could be start-
ing to slow down, the Snowy River
project is moving toward completion,
financial setups that have worked satis-
factorily for nearly two decades are
starting to show cracks . . . What now?
In a population largely devoted to
the production of files or ideas (the
bureaucracy) or to teaching, research,
and ideas (the academics), consciences
are beginning to get restive. Are the
new problems that are emerging getting
sufficient imaginative attention? Is it
time to substitute for fading impulses
fresh, large policies which will carry on
the impetus that has pushed Australia
on over the postwar period? Is the out-
put of ideas keeping pace with the
accumulation of files?
Canberra is Australia’s largest inland
centre. Now with about 100,000 in-
habitants, it is growing at the rate of
some 10,000 a year, perhaps even
faster in the coming years. But most of
its population growth comes from file
builders rather than idea producers.
They are concerned with getting houses,
educating their children, and the
myriad of domestic problems that beset
the everyday Australian. A high propor-
tion of these a higher proportion
than anywhere else in Australia are,
nevertheless, the idea producers of the
future; even though at this stage of
their careers they may have only a
vague feeling about national needs and
development, it is a feeling which, be-
cause of the nature of their jobs, must
grow.
The growth can now occur in a Can-
berra that is already changing since
the record-breaking reign of Sir Robert
Menzies. The euphoniums that Mrs.
Holt put up in the hall of the Prime
Minister’s lodge and the contemporary
paintings she put up on its richly
colored walls are symbols of a new
era.
Even across this short period of time,
it is hard to recall that the highlight
visits to Canberra during the Age of
Menzies were royal visits from the
Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the
Queen Mother, and so on. Now the
emphasis is on people closer to Aus-
tralia’s interests the visit of President
Johnson and the incident-studded visit
of Premier Ky, of South Vietnam. And
this is to be the pattern of the future.
Tun Razak, the Deputy Prime Minister
of Malaysia, is coming to Canberra
shortly. There are to be other visits
from Asian leaders, invitations to the
new Indonesian leadership, return
visits from the nations our Prime Min-
ister will soon be visiting.
Policy is nbq likely to be decided
during an official visit, but these visits
are extremely important in indicating
an attitude of mind and a view of the
world. The attitude of mind these
and coming visits indicate is that Can-
berra’s wavelength, instead of being
tuned almost exclusively to London,
Washington, and Europe (as it has
been in the past), is now being adjusted
much more selectively to Asia, where
Australia is already deeply involved
both militarily and economically and
where it will become much more
deeply involved in the future in many
other ways.
But possibly even more fascinating
at this stage than this development are
those taking place in domestic policy.
The overall cost of Australia’s foreign
policy has been resolved (at least for
the three years’ lifetime of the present
Parliament) by the overwhelming par-
liamentary majority given Holt and his
Liberal-Country Party coalition Govern-
ment by the voters. Yet, although the
election resolved very little on the
domestic side, quite significant changes
in attitude are now taking place,
changes in attitude that could lead to
changes in government approach which
could have a profound effect upon Aus-
tralia’s future.
This is a new Parliament. Twenty
(17 Liberal and three Country Party)
out of a House of Representatives of
124 have never been in the Parliament
before. Almost all the “oldtimers”
have disappeared. As Mr. Gough Whit-
lam pointed out in his new role as
Opposition Leader during the address-
in-reply debate, there are now 90 mem-
bers of the House of Representatives
who have been in the Parliament a
shorter time than his own 14 years.
And of these 90, those on the Coalition
side (and they comprise the majority)
have a much different attitude than
their predecessors. This attitude
emerged very clearly during the
address-in-reply debate, when mem-
bers are allowed to talk about anything
they want to talk about. Unlike their
predecessors, they were not concerned
about the Commonwealth doing too
much. Almost without exception they
were clearly concerned that the Com-
monwealth was doing too little.
To some extent the departure of Sir
Robert Menzies may be responsible for
this alteration in Coalition attitudes.
A superb politician, Menzies was an
innovator only when political events or
political advantage forced innovation
upon him. The decision by the Com-
monwealth to enter the field of State
aid, with financial support for science
blocks in non-State schools, is a sig-
nificant illustration of how he worked.
He had been in power for 14 years and


had done nothing about State aid. But
when the 1963 elections came round,
after the 1961 election which had re-
duced his floor majority in the House
of Representatives to one, Menzies
needed something to win him victory
with an enlarged majority. He decided
to give the science block aid. He swept
the polls.
Though able to strike boldly, Sir
Robert was essentially a disciple of the
status quo. With the dynamics he had
inherited from the Chifley Labor re-
gime the immigration program, the
Snowy Mountains project, control over
banking policy, and the like he could
afford to let events take their course.
Basically this was wise. During his ad-
ministration Australia achieved expan-
sion greater than ever before in its
history.
Backed with the authority of un-
broken political success, Menzies re-
strained his parliamentary followers and
public advisers. He did not look
for radical solutions but for consolida-
tion. Australia needed and benefited
from this period of consolidation.
Holt, however, wants to do things,
positive things. During his first 12
months, necessity demanded that he do
things in the field of foreign policy. He
had to, if he was going to win the
election. Australia’s commitment in
Vietnam and its relations with America
were the area of disputation. It was
here that the Labor Opposition was
challenging him. So, characteristically,
he did things. He committed enlarged
Australian forces to Vietnam and de-
cided that conscripts should serve along-
side regulars there. He went to Vietnam
himself to get first-hand impressions.
He visited Washington to establish
tighter relationships with the United
States administration.
On the local scene, time and oppor-
tunity and the necessity to concentrate
on foreign policy limited his activities.
He was too busy with foreign policy to
produce any new thought in other
areas. He wanted to win a general elec-
tion which would make him a Prime
Minister in his own right and not
merely as Menzies’ successor in foreign
policies. This preoccupation showed in
the speech with which Lord Casey
opened Parliament recently. There is
considerable validity in the Opposition
complaint that as a blueprint for Aus-
tralian development it is remarkably
insipid and uninspired. But even in this
document there was an evidence of
some movement of thought and of an
attempt to grapple with the new prob-
lems of an age when the older pattern
might prove inadequate for Australia’s
needs.
A good example is the new attitude
to foreign investment. Though lip ser-
vice has been paid for some years to
the desirability of Australian investment
and management having some control
over new forms of expansion, no real
action has been taken. Overseas capital,
prepared to take the risks that local
capital either would not face up to or
was insufficiently marshalled to meet,
has met with relatively slight local
competition in the field of new dis-
coveries such as the mineral industry,
which, over the past five years, has
achieved a growth rate of five percent
per annum, with prospects of doubling
this rate in the next five years. Em-
bedded in the Governor-General’s
speech was a line that the Holt Gov-
ernment was “working toward new
arrangements and facilities for the pro-
vision of capital for Australian partici-
pation in ownership and control of
these mineral resources.” Treasurer
William McMahon took this hint a
step further by telling the Parliament
about the possibility of forming a
banking corporation in order to provide
rediscount facilities for the trading
banks if they make advances for the
development of Australian assets by
Australian interests.”
Said McMahon: “Some months ago
the trading banks of Australia sub-
mitted preliminary proposals for
examination. They have been carefully
studied. However, they happen to be
comprehensive, and difficult decisions
will have to be made. I hope that
within the next week or fortnight I
shall be able to put concrete proposals
to the Cabinet for decision.”
In a mood of searching for new
problems, speaker after speaker on the
Coalition side in the address-in-reply
seemed to be groping for a new out-
look. It was as if they were feeling
for something they could not quite
describe.
Two examples:
Mr. Dugald Munro, the new Liberal
MHR for Eden-Monaro: “Something
can be started in a major way (on
water conservation). I refer to vast
possibilities, presently, and only pres-
ently, available in Australia for the
construction of major water conserva-
tion works using the technique of
diffusion blasting. Diffusion blasting is
a translation of a Russian term for a
technique of moving earth and rock,
principally by means of nuclear
explosions. The explosions may also be
produced by conventional explosives,
but nuclear explosions would produce
them more cheaply in big works. We
have the space now. We may not have
it in such abundance later. America
has the technique but has run out of
space. America has done experimental
work in this field and a lot of experi-
mental and constructional work of this
nature has been done in Russia.
American production being what it
is, price lists are available for devices
of this kind . . . the Americans have
for some time been willing to make
them available to us.”
Mr. Robert Katter, the new CP
-member for Queensland’s Kennedy:
“The Government should examine the
system of financing purely develop-
mental projects that was introduced in
the United States after the 1914-18

A country’s growth pivots on its
basic industry. And industry depends
—in nation after nation—on turbines
and generators by Fuji, the fulcrum
of progress.
In Australia, for example, Fuji has
made contributions to the develop-
ment of the Murray No. 1 Power Sta-
tion, the Para Substation, Lemon-
thyme Power Station, and the Wilmot
Power Station. In fact, Fuji Electric
has made countries all over the world
more comfortable places to live in.
And Fuji Electric has made homes
more comfortable places to be in.
People have written to us from over
100 nations telling us how satisfied
they are with our electric fans, shav-
ers, and T.V. sets. But then Fuji

"From royal visits... to people closer to Australia's interests."
war. That country was faced with a
situation somewhat similar to our
present situation. Government and
semi-governmental bodies had reached
a point at which the raising of further
finance was almost impossible. It was
useless to approach the State Govern-
ments because they had just about run
out of money. The Federal Govern-
ment was at its wit’s end to meet the
national accounts. It decided to form
a committee, consisting mainly of
economists, to look at the various places
where finance was lying idle. The com-
mittee discovered huge reserves of
finance in insurance companies and
other large financial houses. The
Government introduced a system of
tax-free bonds which was eminently
successful. It resulted in millions of
dollars becoming available for purely
developmental projects.”
Even the “older” hands obviously
felt the need for something new,
especially in criticism of the dampen-
ing effect of the present tariff policy,
attacked as archaic and unenlightened
in its long-term effects. Ironically,
though the Labor Opposition describes
the Coalition Government as “Conser-
vative,” I could not find a Coalition
speaker who complained that the Com-
monwealth Government was doing too
much. The universal complaint was
chat it was doing too little over a whole
range of activities, including social
services.
Mr. Ray Whittorn, Liberal member
for Melbourne’s Balaclava, who would
probably describe himself as being as
conservative as any man in the Par-
liament, was as preoccupied as any of
his colleagues in searching for new
ideas. “Why,” he asked, “do we not
sit down and look at the economic
setup in Australia and use our bulging
resources, by legislative machinery if
you ' like, to provide against future
droughts? Why do we not use our
bulging resources to build highways and
freeways, ’thus putting an end to the
clamoring by the Premiers for more
money for this or that? Why do we
not use our bulging resources, particu-
larly our mineral resources, to build
bigger and better ports and ensure that
we maintain our present position as one
of the world’s first ten trading nations?
Why do we not use our bulging re-
sources to establish a truly national
shipping line national in character
and national in effect? We have the
resources to do this work. Why don’t
we take some action?”
In recording the fact that the
parliamentarians, Government and
Opposition alike, appeared anxious to
find new ideas, I am not suggesting
that all or any of the proposals they
put forward represent long-term answers
to Australia’s needs. But I do suggest
that there is an .atmosphere in Can-
berra (where of necessity such things
have to start) suggesting need for a
fresh surge forward and the desire to
build into the Australian economy new
and long-term expansionary impulses.
Though I have used politicians to
illustrate my point, this atmosphere is
not confined to them. It has also
affected the top brass, the policy in-
fluences of the public service. Under-
standably so. Public servants at this
level move through the same corridors
of power as the politicians. The public
servants influence the politicians. The
politicians influence the public servants.
Who starts things moving is a chicken-
or-the-egg question.
Holt himself is clearly affected by
the need for new ideas. It is very easy
to say that a Prime Minister should be
his own ideas producer. That is
what he is elected and paid for. But
there are only 24 hours even in a
Prime Minister’s day. He has somebody
on his doorstep practically every
minute of his working day. The late
John Curtin, when Prime Minister, got
away with putting his feet up on the
desk, placing a cigarette in his long
holder, and just staring up at the ceil-
ing thinking. But Curtin had two big
advantages. He had in the late Ben
Chifley, as Treasurer, a lieutenant who
was not only unflinchingly and dis-
interestedly loyal, but an administrator
who was absorbed by the detail which
irritated Curtin. In addition, the pre-


sent Ministerial habit of trying to avoid
responsibility by referring to Cabinet
anything that might produce trouble
for its originator had not reached its
present absurd scale. As I hear it,
Cabinet over the past five weeks has
dealt with 140 submissions, some of
them up to 30 pages in length. Trying
to absorb that mass of paper alone
would not leave a Prime Minister time
to scratch himself, let alone do any
thinking.
Holt is clearly trying to correct this
by adopting United States methods. He
was impressed, when he travelled with
President Johnson while Johnson was in
Australia, with the efficiency of John-
son’s personal staff arrangement. John-
son had researchers and people
responsible for bringing to his atten-
tion, in a precise form, things that
should be brought to his attention. In-
stead of having to write a speech in a
couple of minutes taken out of a busy
day, Johnson had speechwriters. Holt
has now strengthened his staff by
appointing as principal private secre-
tary Mr. Peter Bailey, an assistant sec-
retary of the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment, a very senior officer with un-
limited access to the masses of paper
which is part of the public service’s
production line. He has also appointed
Mr. Keith Sinclair, former editor of the
Melbourne “Age,” as a consultant who
is to operate in a much more nebulous
field than Bailey, but who is clearly to
be a feeder of “ideas” to the Prime
Minister.
Personally, I think Holt could have
gone much further. I think he could
have started adopting a much stiffer
attitude with sort of his junior
Ministers. He could, with advantage,
tell them to face up to their responsi-
bilities by making their own decisions
instead of swamping Cabinet with long
submissions on “chickenfeed” subjects.
He could also tell the Cabinet secre-
tariat to adopt the practice, followed by
the British Cabinet secretariat, in
which an unduly long submission is
sent back to the department concerned
with an instruction to cut it to a maxi-
mum of five pages.
But Holt is probably too good-
natured to humiliate either the Minister
or the department involved. He lacks
Menzies’ strain of ruthlessness. Menzies
insisted upon getting time to think and
write speeches. Holt seems constitution-
ally unable to do this, and you see the
consequences in his speeches. His first
speech on any topic consists of feeling
his way. It is only after he has spoken
repeatedly on any subject that his
speeches start to take on shape,
coherency, and intellectual content.
Sinclair’s presence could assist to some
extent to correct this shortcoming. It
is an indication that Holt, like Can-
berra itself, is groping for new ideas.
You can detect this post-Menzies
change in approach to new thought in
the public service as well as in Holt.
"He went to Vietnam himself ... "
There is now a much greater degree of
flexibility. It showed itself during the
recent Premiers’ Conference when the
perennial issue of Commonwealth-State
financial relationships came up again
for review. Under Menzies the pre-
dominant interest of the Common-
wealth public service was to retain the
status quo. They were quite happy
with things as they were. They wanted
to keep things as they were. But under
Holt the desire has been not so much
to retain the status quo as to find a
practical solution.
It is in the higher echelon that the
academics of Canberra have their effect.
Academics like Trevor Swan (Profes-
sor of Economics in the Institute of
Advanced Studies at the Australian
National University), Horrie Brown
(another economist at the ANU), the
ANU’s vice-chancellor, Sir John Craw-
ford, Heinz Arndt (another economist
at the ANU), and Fin Crisp (Professor
of Political Science at the ANU) all
have their contacts within the public
service. They meet their public service
friends at parties and gatherings. Many
of them have been in the public ser-
vice themselves. Swan was in Treasury,
Crawford head of the Trade Depart-
ment, and Crisp was a top adviser to
Chifley when Chifley was Prime
Minister. They argue interminably on
governmental issues and policies. They
undoubtedly have their overall influ-
ence and they undoubtedly have an
indirect, but in some ways effective,
influence upon the politicians.
Physically, Holt’s Canberra is little
changed from Menzies’ Canberra. Cul-
ture is if anything more than ever the
“in” thing. The Canberra theatre is
functioning, the city is a must on the
lecture circuit, meetings of academic
groups are as much part of the city
life as the flies, and the suburbs con-
tinue to expand into the good grazing
paddocks. But the most distinctive dif-
ference between Menzies’ and Holt’s
Canberra is that in Canberra, which is
at once a place where people live and
the symbol of Australian administration,
there seems to be a general acceptance
on the part of the politicians, the public
service hierarchy, and the academics
that the forces which brought postwar
expansion to Australia are losing their
potency and need either replacement or
supplementing. Meanwhile, the tourists
continue to arrive, to inspect Lake
Burley Griffin, Parliament House, the
War Memorial, Ned Kellf\ skull, and
Phar Lap’s heart.

The Rise of the Anti-Glossies
By DAVID SALTER
MORE reliable than the most
sophisticated market research
statistics, a city news-stand gives
an up-to-date and detailed guide to
what people are reading. Like any
other seller, the news-vendor puts his
quick-moving lines in front. What you
see first is selling fastest. But while
the highly colored glossy publications
and mass-circulation magazines fight it
out at eye-level positions, a glance to-
ward the bottom of the news-stand
reveals another, smaller tussle, the fast
and troubled conflicts of the anti-
glossies.
The process began when, with the
banning of “Playboy” and the proven
market value of satire in “OZ,” on
New Year’s Eve, 1964, the “Kings
Cross Whisper” was launched as the
first of the “new” tabloids. After the
novelty and public hoo-ha subsided,
the whisper that had swelled to a roar
soon dwindled to a whisper, and by
January, 1966, “Whisper” circulation
had collapsed from its peak of
210,000 to a publisher’s claim of
150,000 (and now much less). Although
the streets of Kings Cross are once
again clear for the normal traffic of
prostitution, the “Whisper’s” comfort-
able retirement to the news-stand and
suburban newsagent’s display was ample
proof that the non-sporting independent
tabloid could make money.
The rest (and most) of the anti-
glossies can be roughly divided into
two main groups: those exploiting good
old-fashioned sex and those which are
part of the pop-music boom. Each
offers variations on its theme, but all
strive for the rewards of the simplest
and most common publishing formula
—cheap production and mass circula-
tion.
Early in 1966 three more of these
publications appeared. With the instal-
lation of a reel-fed offset printing press
at Glen Waverley, Melbourne’s poten-
tial “Whisper” and “OZ” editors had
access to the right equipment. “Tom
Thumb,” a nudes-plus-humor monthly
which had been founded by Paul
Howard in late 1965, began to put on
sales as it mastered the problems of
spacing copy, pin-ups, and cartoons
within quarto or “OZ”-size pages. The
“Thumb” is more cheeky than satirical,
but it has recently included sharp treat-
ment of current issues. Where the
“Whisper” simply prints nudes, “Tom
Thumb” at least adds ballooned cap-
tions with mildly entertaining results.
“Tom Thumb” seems to lean on the
humor of America’s “Mad” magazine.
The Letters page uses the same style
of quippy editorial comment tacked on
to the end of each letter; the letters
themselves often echo past nonsense
mail received by “Mad.” The March
“TT” features a satire of the ravy
pop papers (“The Young Spurter”).
“LONDON: In a determined, last-
ditch attempt to make British teenagers
notice him, Australia’s number one pop
idol, Normie Rowe, spent all last week
faking suicide leaps into the Thames.”)
Apart from “OZ,” the “Thumb” is
the only magazine which attempts
straight political satire.
On Calwell (within a mock poster
for a film of his life): “A Brave
Touching Tale of Our Times About a
Man who was 50 Years Behind Them.”
On Holt: “He spent so long in the
shadow of greatness that when he
finally came out in the sun he went a
bit troppo.”
On Teenage Competitions: “Win
Half a Dozen Bottles of Ray Brown’s
Bath Water!”
Coinciding with the crest of Beatle-
mania, “Go-Set,” “the teen and twen-
ties newspaper,” and Australia’s first
pop-music weekly, began printing on
the same press which prints “Tom
Thumb.” With its black and red mast-
head, spectacular pictorial layouts and
unbearably “with-it” jargon (“Raving
Round Australia”), “Go-Set” has the
professional look.
An indication of its present pros-
perity is that it sent a reporter (Lily
Brett) to London. In conjunction with
an airline, Miss Brett was flown to the
swinging capital to cover the pop scene
for “Go-Set.” One of her choicer pars
on Rowe’s reception in Liverpool: “He
was not badly hurt, although some of
the scratches he received were rather
nasty, and he claims to be missing
quite a bit of hair.” Some scratches
OK, but the hair! For the more literate
readers, “Go-Set” has a weekly cross-
word solution which requires an inti-
mate knowledge of the stars and their
hablts - . .
Contrasting with t h e complete
absence„ of advertising in both . Tom
Thumb and Kings Cross Whisper,
Go-Set has a fat schedule of ad book-
mgs. Page three of a recent edition

Go-Set is careful to cater for fields
withm the teenage market other than
the all-consuming pop; this flexibility
wi l no doubt be useful when the jour-
nal has to switch to whatever supersedes
go-go R & B, being-switched-on, Nor-

If Sydney is the sexual centre of
national publishing, then Melbourne is
where the action is in pop. After
a brief flourish, “Teen Age Jet Stream”
lan imitation “Go-Set” for New South
Welshcats) was quietly withdrawn from
circulation.
Recently, a group of ex-“Tharunka”
(University of N.S.W.) staff members
published the first of a projected fort-
nightly tabloid cryptically titled “Drift.”
Nowhere near as accomplished as “Go-
Set,” this new Sydney challenger is
basically covering the same ground of
music and fashion. But the layout is
patchy, too, loud and amateurish even
for a readership accustomed to “Go-
Set’s” flamboyance, sales for “Drift”
No. 2 were 8000.
“Censor,” the newsprint “Playboy”
edited and produced by Richard
Graham in Sydney, is the paper for
those who like their sex neat. The last
of the hard-selling girlie anti-glossies
to join the group in early 1966, “Cen-
sor” breeds, between its nudes, that
curious, “free-thinking” pretentiousness
which makes Hugh Hefner’s “The Play-
boy Philosophy” such an infuriating
bore. By arrangement with Hefner,
Graham has published some of “Play-
boy’s” choicer gate-fold pin-ups, and,
as a symbol of defiance, used the
material which caused “Playboy” to be
banned in Australia on the cover of
his first issue.
“Censor” has been in and out of
the courts ever since. Prosecutions have
followed the publication of almost every
edition and circulation seems steady at
about 40,000. By using the old tech-
nique of having overseas literature
mailed to him page by page in sealed
envelopes, Graham has been able to
serialise “Fanny Hill” and the “ABZ
of Love.”
The present edition (No. 8) boasts
a pin-up calendar which reproduces a
grotesque, turn-of-the-century collection
of “feelthy postcards.” An inserted bro-
chure, in full color, advertises “Adult
Books” (“You have received this List
as you were on our Adult Mailing
List”). Available at' outrageous prices,
these volumes promise invaluable in-
formation on everything from Coital
Mechanics to the Disorders of the
Libido. Graham used the pages of
“Censor” to push his own banned-book
trade; an ad for “The Kama Sutra”
(“The Hindu Art of Love Illus-
trated”) is in every issue. William
Burrough’s “The Naked Lunch” is his
latest; the proceeds of this trade “will
go toward continuing to fight the 40
charges laid against ‘Censor’.”
“Censor” seems to have established
itself as the extreme to which a local
girlie magazine can go while still gain-
ing distribution.
The existing anti-glossy market has
come to the stage where every basic
area is covered by a newspaper or
magazine which typifies and in some
cases has moulded the desires of its
readership. A revamped brighter “OZ”
is gradually winning more readers,
“Tom Thumb” is riding a middle line
between soft satire and sex, the “Whis-
per” is sticking to its shoddy produc-
tion and nudes-plus-funnies policy while
“Censor,” although it shows an
occasional dash of humor, sells on the
steady demand for straight sex. “Go-
Set,” having worked its way into the
pop “scene” to the extent that it is
almost indispensable, seems safe in a
market it has helped to create.
All of this by courtesy of the spare
change in the teenager’s pocket and
the leniency of the courts.

AWARD WINNER 1966
This is the new Captain Cook Bridge, Sydney.
It is a PSC Structure, overall length 1,662 feet,
with the seven spans of the bridge measuring 185
to 250 ft. each. The bridge is designed to carry
six traffic lanes.
John Holland Constructions built it for the
N.S.W. Department of Main Roads and won
the 1966 Construction Achievement Award.
Congratulations.
OUR MAIN CONTRIBUTION was 736 con-
crete box girder segments. Stressed together into
4 box girders they form the 7 spans of the bridge.
These Box Girder segments are quite imposing
in their dimensions and weights: up to 20 tons,
with measurements from 11' x 8' x 8' to 11' x 12'
x 12'; surface tolerance ± i". We cast them at
our Auburn Factory, about 20 miles from the site.
It wasn’t exactly a small job, shaping 16000
tons of concrete into over 100 different segmental
designs. But this is the type of project we are
geared to handle in any of our 50-plus concrete
factories anywhere in Australia.
IF YOU HAVE A CONCRETE PROBLEM
big or small, why not give us a ring. Our engineers

On Being an Anti'Communist Poet
I This hurts me more than
it hurts Yevtushenko
On the recent trial and imprisonment of the two Soviet
writers, Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, Yevtushenko
said: “I agree with what was done with them, but not with
how it was done. I agree that they should have been
punished. Should they be allowed to wash their dirty linen
outside their own country?”—THE TIMES.
Noble language springs the trap shut.
But keep talking, Yevgeni. All my life
I walked left, and thought Jerusalem,
Its walls and pavements burning through my side,
Yet can’t imagine how a man is led
That way to become the People’s Folksinger,
Or whatever it is you are, who said
How strange a time it is
When common integrity can look like courage.
Well, some poets are weathercocks,
Some weather forecasters. For myself,
I want only to feel Jerusalem’s weather.
Plus ca change. You did not always
Listen for the “tread of the pendulum,” did not
Sit in the seat of judgment
Where your thumbs-down could make the world’s
headlines.
Those are the minor perks of fame. Well then,
Shall we invent new ideologies, new
Slogans: “You can’t have eggs without an omelette,”
Or: “Poetry should speak
When spoken to.” Or shall we promote
Cultural Understanding
With endless formulas of “In my country . . .”?
No. In your country still
The brave practise truth through terror,
The young are almost suffocated
With the bile, contempt. Old men
Hide poems like defiance in a desk
And wonder why they keep so sharp a thorn.
And the meek wait, perhaps,
For Adam Wazyk’s “holy human time.”
These are midnight thoughts. And,
Later on, at the suicide hour,
I may even start imagining
How, some day, someone, not I, will write
For a few more to read: “Vincent Buckley.
Fate unknown. He was against them.”
Autumn’s brief longing for a winter blaze;
Hardly a fancy you would understand,
Being barb or splinter of Jerusalem.
That Jerusalem has no bright paving.
Sinyavsky, Pasternak, Daniel,
Josef Brodsky, all with fixed mouths,
Walk there like ghosts over brimstone,
Three of them Jews; and Yevgeni
On his feet composing Babiy Yar.
Babiy Yar. Israel, O Israel,
Every generation you can find
At least three children for the furnace,
Whose bones will be the whole house of Israel.
Even in so dull -an Apocalypse
You make for us our holy human time.
If I think now of Jerusalem I think
Of the white blossom branching over stone
And the names I would work there. Foreign names.
The dead are no-man’s-land
Which few of the living care to enter,
Whose wheat grows up the dark into the waiting
Air, the slanted rain, the awkward lives.
We are both still here, and where you stand
History moves and hardens,
Covering the earth you once touched with wonder.
Then learn from that superb dialectician

How to hold a stance between
The barbed wire and the trampled bed
II. An honest poet’s comment
on the foregoing
Look, Buckley, your perverted sense of honor
Has gone too far this time. Nobody cares
What you think. You’re not a folk-hero
Or a new symbol of rapprochement
Between here and there. No girls bring
Flowers to lay them at your platform feet.
You’re nothing. N.0.T.H.1.N.G.
Yevgeni’s much more lovable than you,
He loves life, his laughter’s three bags full.
“Courage has never been my quality,”
He wrote, “I did no more than write, never de-
nounced,”
And “Men live. Men are trouble-makers,”
He said, “They’re coming. Don’t be afraid.”
As for your poetry, the muscle-ads
Were made for you. “They laughed when he stood
up to read.”
Everything about you gripes me off.
Good God, you’re over-sensitive to light,
You can’t stand darkness, you’re afraid of dusk:
A fine specimen of the neuro-Christian
Sans eyes, sans teeth, sans every bloody thing.
So here’s a toast, if not to Superman,
At least to SuperMeanSensual Man,
And you can watch the bottoms of our glasses.
When people ask us how you are, we’ll have
To tell them, “Buckley’s gone political,
Anti-life. I think he’s off his head.”
You won’t mind, old chap; but you asked for it.

The Trains in Spain
By BARRY JONES
MADRID’S Prado Gallery is the
finest (and most conservative) in
Europe, with the best collection
of Velazquez, Goya, El Greco, and
Bosch in the world. My only major
mistake in going there was to entrust
myself to the Spanish Railways
(RENFE). The journey began aus-
piciously enough on the superb French
SNCF train which ran from Paris to
the border. Most international expresses
hurtle their human cargoes from
capital to capital without changing
trains at the border but the prin-
ciple of reciprocity breaks down with
Spain. It is no advantage to the
French to exchange one of their
sparkling fliers for a dingy Spanish
square-wheeled horror. After a superb
trip through the Loire valley, Tours,
Bordeaux, and Biarritz, trouble began
at Irun, the border town.
Bustled off the French train at 5.20
p.m., we drooped for over an hour in
the grubby Irun station while unshaven
police rummaged through our hand-
luggage. There were no civilised faci-
lities for eating or washing. At last
the RENFE train chugged in. After a
brief glance and briefer smell, I deci-
ded that, egalitarian or not, second-class
travel was not for me. Clutching a
handful of ten-peseta notes, I pointed
to the two dark, locked first-class car-
riages and with rising inflection (and
a hasty look at the phrase book)
pleaded, “Primero? Dormitorio?” First-
class remained dark and locked. I was
propelled into an eight-seater com-
partment with nine Spaniards already
in situ, my sole comfort a tiny, grubby
straw pillow bought on the platform
which I clutched Linus-like through
the long December night.
The Irun-Madrid journey, 400 miles
long, took 13 hours to complete. After
a short journey into the mountains to
reach the vast Meseta, our route was
flat, so that the average speed of 30
mph was maddeningly slow. When we
pulled out of Irun at 7.00 p.m. the
lights were immediately extinguished
and my attempts to read by torchlight
aroused such a frenzy of irritation that
.1 soon gave up. This began a night of
Boschian horror. The corridors were
filled with nuns, huge pregnancies, and
soldiers. The lucky seat-holders always
rationalise that the standers will be
alighting at the first stop. Cigarettes
provided the only illumination, alcohol
the almost universal anodyne. The pre-
vailing smell was not tobacco but
urine. The corridors were impassable—
and any attempt to get up might lose
one’s seat. “Americano?” companions
asked. They were pleased to know I
was Australian, since this was the year
of Spain’s appearance in the Davis
Cup challenge round. Then the soldiers
began hours of singing, shouting, and
drunken heel-tapping, just like MGM
Spaniards in films. Tedium can go no
further. Conscious that Anglo-Saxons
are notorious for their sang-froid, one
resisted the impulse to scream or to
chew the straw pillow, and sat there
twitching all nigbt, brooding on what
one would tell General Franco if one
met him (especially if he was in one
of those first-class carriages), or on
what one would do if one actually
were the Generalissimo. At least, I
reflected, third-class must be worse.
I had made the fatal mistake of
registering my vast baggage (last seen
at Irun) through from the Austerlitz
station, imagining that it was following
me, eight carriages behind, in the care
of an RENFE employee who would
cherish it. My great hope had been
that on arriving at Madrid I would
have one vast washing spree, where
all the horrors of preceding days of
travel would be ceremonially purified
preferably by an immaculate
lavandera working for slave-labor rates
and 1 could chan ? e mto P ro ‘

told that it would come Manana
perhaps.” Where was it? “Somewhere
on the Meseta.” What if it did not
come tomorrow? A shrug and a wave.
Pressed for time, as usual, I planned
to book for Vienna immediately I had
seen the Prado but it would have
been disloyal and improvident to
abandon my luggage. It took two full
days and eight irritable trips to the
North Station before I retrieved it.
The glories of the Prado are almost
enough to make one forget the
RENFE. The guide book says flatly,
“Velazquez is the best painter of all
time,” and the impact of 53 master-
pieces, many of them variants of the
same subject, compel your agreement
-—■ until you see the 34 El Grecos.
There are 103 Goya paintings and
485 etchings and sketches, the most
piercing, nightmarish visions of horrors
and death made by working thick,
gummy ink-blots with the fingers on
small pieces of buff paper. The delights
o'f the English menu in the Prado
cafeteria include Milk-schakes, iool
drinks, convined Ice-creams (including
Vainilla), and “Cheeps” potatoes.
The Madrid underground railway
(“Metro”) offers more mob violence
and outrage per kilometre than its
Tokyo equivalent. Jammed so tightly
that my arms were kept above my
head, I endured twenty minutes of
animal-like hysteria, screams, and
blows, and woke next morning with
bruised ribs and toes. Nuns and
priests were given no quarter, either.
One had exaggerated visions of a
clerical-fascist Spain, fanatically devout
and priest-ridden. This may be true
of rural areas, but it is hard to find
in Madrid or Barcelona. The main
reading matter seemed to be comic
books. The blind, of which there are
many, are employed in selling lottery
tickets on each street corner, doing
brisk business. It is regarded as an
inevitable part of natural law that
the blind should fulfil this socially use-
ful function. Horoscope sellers out-
number priests, in my count, by three
to one. Magazine stalls are full of
fashion magazines. Women wearing
slacks or shorts (even in winter, Mad-
rid has a superb climate) were un-
molested. Copies of “Time” and
“Economist,” even with critical articles
on Spain, are uncensored. Another
misconception gone: stills of British
and American horror films showed
more nudity and violence than sensi-
tive Australians have been exposed to,
notably shots from “El Coleccionista.”
lan Fleming’s “The Spy Who Loved
Me” is available, as are all the Bond
books, in both Spanish and English.
Perhaps the Generalissimo uses porno-
politics to keep Spaniards at home.
Censorship is reserved for news which
exposes inefficiency in the regime—
for example, the appalling railroad
collision near Salamanca on December
18, 1965, with 30 dead, was blacked
out of Madrid’s papers, although
written up in London, Paris, and Mel-
bourne.
After a gargantuan’s dinner (“coc-
hinillo asado”—roast sucking pig) in
the tiled cellar of “Casa de Botin,”
founded in 1727 and celebrated in
Hemingway’s “The Sun Also Rises,” I
reeled into the vast Plaza Mayor to
see an army of stalls selling Christmas
trees, plastic animals, cribs and mangers
for domestic nativity scenes, yards of
tinsel, and colored lights. Sweetly but
incongruously above the hubbub, loud-
speakers played English Christmas
carols, as recorded by the King’s Col-
lege Chapel Choir, Cambridge, under
David Willcocks.
The next day was marked by a lot-
tery draw. When I marched down for
breakfast at the hotel the waiters
could hardly be dragged away from the
televised drawing; and after I had
prayed for strength for one more assault
on the baggage department of Estacion
Norte thev were still irayina dassv
eyedf a. the screem Z I tote To
the station, and when I returned, empty-
handed, in the same taxi, the car radio
tormented me with the longest and
most inane folksong in the world, an
infinite series of variations on the same
twittering theme, sung by a soprano.
The driver listened intently, like Bartok
finding a new Rumanian folk-theme,
to the seven repeated semi-quavers on
C, followed by a falling chromatic
scale of seven notes. “What is the
song?” I asked the (fortunately) Eng-
lish-speaking cab driver. “She is sing-
ing the lottery numbers—can’t you hear
it? Cuarenta y dos mil ochocientos
dieciseis (42,816), cincuenta mil dos-
cientos uno (50,201) . . .” Back at the
hotel they were still watching the lot-
tery on television.
To consume the time waiting for my
bags, I visited Phillip ll’s grim palace
and mausoleum, El Escorial, thirty
miles west of Madrid, and General
Franco’s future mausoleum and Civil
War monument, Valle de los Caidos
(Valley of the Fallen), which only
awaits El Caudillo himself for com-
pletion. Planned as a grand gesture of
reconciliation so that all the Civil War
dead could be buried there, the inscrip-
tion “For God and for Spain” is
thought to exclude most Republicans.

huge nave for a full three minutes
shouted, Why, you ve got a Bell and
Howell, just like me. I had just
enough presence of mind to mumble
No hablo ingles, and move away,
Two great challenges remained
collecting my baggage and booking
through to Vienna. Unable to solve
the great laundry problem, I had
bought new shirts, socks, and strangu-
lated-hernia-producing underpants. As
soon as my baggage arrived I went
straight to the ticket office at Estacion
Norte. But no this was an IN
station. I could only book for Vienna
at an OUT station. So off to the
Estacion Atocha. No they only sold
tickets within an hour of the trains
departure (by which time, of course,
all seats would usually be taken): I
would have to go to the Central Book-
ing Office at Calle de Alcala during
hours of daylight. I wrote out my
requirements on a piece of paper:
“Primero clasa: Madrid a Cebere
(bordertown). Segundo clasa, Cebere
a Vienna.” This seemed to baffle all the
officials and I was passed along seven
consecutive ticket windows before being
referred to an old man who spoke
faltering English. After nearly forty
minutes, my ticket was written out
but only as far as Barcelona. I would
have to go through the same procedure
again there. No they would not
accept American Express travellers’
cheques. They hoped that a bank might
be able to exchange them for pesetas.
Most transactions were carried out with
the greatest gravity and courtesy,
although some officials slammed their
windows with a surliness not found
even in British Railways. No official
would ever accept a tip. Dignidad still
means a great deal.
The first-class carriage was a vast
improvement empty enough for me
to stretch out fully and sleep. My com-
panion, an egregiously respectable
businessman, was armed with seven
bottles of spirits pointing toward him
on the luggage rack. With the greatest
aplomb he woke me seven times to
offer the honor of the first swallow
for each bottle. Before long we were
joined by a young American teacher
who had been hounded out of the Cali-
fornia school system by John Birchers.
After two hours of his inanities I began
to see some rough justice in this.
Whatever time they may arrive,
Spanish trains have at least one saving
grace; they leave on the dot. Our
express from Madrid arrived at 9.50
a.m. the express to the border, billed
as a connecting train., had left on
schedule, at 9.30. The officials re-
assured me there would be another
train to the border eight hours later.
This gave me time to examine Gaudi’s
Sagrada Familia church, a major
disappointment, much inferior to its
photographs, still far from complete
and repellant at close quarters. The
remaining hours were devoted to find-
ing a lavatory which would meet the
smell test and not induce an attack
of vomiting. After many bitter disap-
pointments I returned to the railway
station and, feeling like 007, crept
into a first-class carriage of a station-
ary train and performed with infinite
relief what is not supposed to be done
in a stationary train. I had just
emerged from the train when a young
woman accosted me. “You’re Barry
Jones, aren’t you?” I grumpily assen-
ted. She was staying for three months
in Barcelona with her special friend,
she explained, and would be returning
to Adelaide in a fortnight after a
week in Paris and Rome. Why so
long in Barcelona? She had been told
it was the nicest town in Europe
and she had gone everywhere by
plane and car. What could I do but
advise her, if she wanted to see the
best of Spanish life, to travel north
by train, especially Segundo Clasa?


OVERSEAS
How do the Japanese really
see themselves now?
By a special reporter
NOW that Prime Minister Sato has
been given a mandate to run the
Government at least to the
critical year of 1970 which most
Japanese fear will be an ominous one
because the Security Treaty comes up
for renegotiation or abrogation on one
year’s notice people are wondering
where Japan will go from here. Will
it loom in the coming years as the
dominant shaping force in Asia? Will
Sato assume a more active political
role toward his neighbors on the Con-
tinent? Is Japan, in effect, suddenly
succeeding to bring about economically
what it once failed to achieve militarily,
its pre-war dream of a “Greater East
Asia Co-prosperity Sphere”?
The answers to all these questions
must be a tentative “No.” Or, at least,
a “not yet.” Japan probably has the
capacity to be much more active diplo-
matically than it is, but it still lacks
both the will and the confidence.
Economically, Japan is the only ad-
vanced nation in Asia today, and one of
the world’s industrial giants. It leads
the world in shipbuilding, is the second
largest producer of radios and television
sets, third largest producer of steel,
autos, and watches. It has overtaken
Germany in the production of cameras.
Yet, for all its potential power, it seems
content to remain a big factory and a
friend to all, with a special relationship
to the U.S.
Politically, Japan has an almost
traumatic fear of failing again as it
did in World War 11. Despite prodding
from Washington to take a more active
and constructive role among its neigh-
bors, Japan continues to see itself only
in an economic role. Its booming trade
with Red China, for instance, strictly
separates the economics from politics;
it has no diplomatic relations with the
mainland.
A sub-editor of the mass-circulation
and highly respected newspaper “Asahi
Shimbun,” as we talked in a downtown
Tokyo coffee shop over the roar of
construction crews putting up another
of the new elevated freeways that are
changing the face of the capital, told
me: “Deep in our hearts we would like
to play some role in Asian affairs. That
is -why there were so many exchanges
of visits last year between our leaders
and those from other Asian countries.
But the effect of these visits is too small
to evaluate.
“Even though it is now more than
20 years after the end of World War 11,
we Japanese remain very conscious of
it. We fear that Asian people might
regard us as politically ambitious or
aggressive. I don’t know, perhaps we
are over-sensitive and Asians don’t
really feel that way about us, but we
fear that they do. So the first step,
our leaders feel, is to help the Japanese
people and the country to prosper.”
Until recently the Japanese seemed
to have temporarily stopped thinking
of themselves as Asians. As a seasoned
Western diplomat and old Asia hand
in Tokyo notes: “Up to two or three
years ago, the Japanese didn’t even
want to feel like Asians. If you asked
them to join a group, they wanted it
to be OECD, ILO, GATT. They
wanted to caucus with America and
Western Europe. They thought of
themselves as a modern, industrialised
country that had more in common with
us than Asia. But in the past few years
they have come to see themselves much
more as Asians, even to the degree of
telling Westerners that ‘you don’t under-
stand us Asians’.”
Japan’s slight, intelligent Minister of
the Economic Planning Agency, Kiichi
Miyazawa, one of Sato’s brains trusters,
agrees. “Japan will remain the indus-
trial centre of Asia,” he says. “I fail
to see Japan as a recognised political
leader in Asia.” Since the election
strengthened the Government, Miya-
zawa visualises a greater economic con-
tribution to Asian aid programs, in-
creased trade ties with neighbors, and
more focus on world affairs - which
were almost totally ignored in the
crucial months before the election —
but “I don’t think we will play much
of a political role . . . we are still
cautious; except for trade ties, we do
not know clearly in which direction to
move.”
To Sato’s credit, it must be pointed
out that since assuming office follow-
ing the resignation of the cancer-
stricken Ikeda in 1964, he has been
more active diplomatically than his pre-
decessor, whose sole concern seemed
to be the nation’s income - doubling
scheme. While avoiding specific action,
Sato has come out strongly—despite
Japan’s Premier Eisaku Sato
public and Press opposition—in sup-
port of U.S. policy in Vietnam. He is
said to believe privately that Japan
should re-arm; to say this publicly to
the Japanese, who are so violently
against anything that even mildly
approaches militarism, would be poli-
tical suicide. Whether he will now
actively urge a stronger role in sup-
porting the U.S. in Vietnam is
questionable.
In the past 18 months, however, the
Sato Government has taken concrete
actions that suggest Japan’s emergence
from its postwar hibernation. But all
of these, again, have been in the area
of economic co-operation.
In late 1965 the Government suc-
ceeded in normalising its relations with
South Korea, quite a feat considering
the preliminary lengthy and delicate
negotiations with its proud ex-colony,
while the Leftist Opposition and numer-
ous anti-Seoul Korean residents in
Japan heckled in the wings.
In the same period, Japan quietly
launched its own Peace Corps in Asia
and enthusiastically supported the idea
of an Asian Development Bank, match-
ing the U.S. $2OO million contribution.
Then, last April, the Japanese on their
own initiative convened the South-East
Asian Ministerial Conference for De-
velopment, bringing the Ministers of
eight nations to Tokyo to discuss
regional development plans.
Following up this first step, Japan

hosted a South-East Asian conference
on agricultural development in Decem-
ber which focused on specific ways to
increase food production, especially at
the rice-paddy level. After being prod-
ded by the U.S., but in the interest
of its own investments there as well,
Japan late last year also called the
“Tokyo Club” meeting of Indonesian
creditors. Most recently, Japan played
host to the regional conference of the
Association of Asian National Develop-
ment Banks. Representatives of 20
institutions in 16 countries, ranging
from Taiwan to Iran, came together to
discuss mutual problems and the Asian
bank.
Last June, with some initial reluc-
tance but no later regrets, Japan par-
ticipated in the Korean-sponsored Asian
and Pacific Foreign Ministers’ Confer-
ence (ASPAC). Nine Asian nations
attended the Seoul session, where
machinery was established for strength-
ening solidarity and co-operation, safe-
guarding national independence and
developing national economies. Korea
and Taiwan wanted the nine to band
together in a formal anti-Communist
grouping, but Japan, mindful of its
domestic politics and booming China
trade, threw its weight toward making
ASPAC loose in operation and moder-
ate of purpose.
Even economic co-operation is some-
times impeded by the ambivalent feeling
about Japan still held by such places
as the Philippines, Singapore, and Hong
Kong (in contrast to Malaysia, In-
donesia, and Thailand, where the feel-
ing is generally warm).
To sum up how Asia still feels about
Japan, the consensus, as revealed in a
recent Associated Press survey, is that
of “uncomfortable neighbors.” Opinions
ranged from the vitriolic one of Yoon
Chai Sool, an Opposition politician in
Seoul, who called Japan “a political
prostitute” which deals with any coun-
try, Communist or not, provided it can
make money, to the slowly growing
attitude in Asia that was expressed by
a student in Malaysia: “The Japanese
help us quietly. They do not make a
hue and cry about it. What they get
in return they are grateful for.”
While it will surely be some time
before Japan assumes any major leader-
ship role in the Asian community, it
does seem to want to become a “con-
tact point” between the diverse nations
of that community through its partici-
pation and sponsorship of various
economic conferences. And the very
quality of caution and patience is likely
to pay off in the long run. But for the
moment Japan is content to improve its
own standard of living and national
assets, to depend on the U.S. for its
security, to show some gesture of
economic assistance to its poorer neigh-
bors as befits an advanced nation, and
to remain, as the Asahi man put it,
“the salesman.”


Britain: Pulling out west,
south, east of Suez
THE BRITISH Government was re-
cently accused of treating its East of
Suez policy as a Hindu treats his
sacred cow: “neither feeding it properly
nor putting it out of its misery.”
It will, for example, withdraw from
Aden but slightly increase forces
stationed at Bahrain and Sharza in
the Persian Gulf; evacuate Borneo but
remain, at least in the immediate
future, in Singapore; salute Malta fare-
well, and try to arrange alternative
staging posts south of the Red Sea.
What of Britain’s present commit-
ments?
Britain’s defence costs may be listed
under the headings of home defence,
the collective security alliances of
NATO, CENTO, and SEATO, Com-
monwealth defence agreements, bi-
lateral treaties with small States, and
obligations with the United Nations.
Of a total home-recruited force of
some 420,000 military, more than half
are stationed in the British Isles, 63,000
are in Europe, mainly in the British
Army on the Rhine, and 22,000 are
in the Mediterranean and Near East.
Of special concern to Australia are
69,000 in the Middle East and Far
East. Elsewhere, mostly around the
Atlantic and its shores, are another
10,000 or so.
The circumstances of the deployment
of these forces in NATO, CENTO,
and SEATO are fairly well known. Less
publicised are the bilateral defence
agreements with the small territories
of Malta, Cyprus (on which a nuclear
bomber force is stationed), Libya, the
Federation of Southern Arabia, and
Persian Gulf States such as Bahrain
and Kuwait. Further east, Britain is
bound by treaties with Malaysia, Singa-
pore, and the Sultanate of Brunei.
The British Government, in the midst
of slicing and pruning its defence ex-
penditure, still proclaims its intention
to be “fully capable of carrying out all
commitments.” How this will be
managed is not altogether clear.
West of Suez
In Malta the army will withdraw
entirely, and only a few essential naval
facilities and a minor RAF staging
post will remain. Within 18 months
Malta will be finished as a military
base of any consequence. Britain’s
Mediterranean forces will then consist
of army garrisons in Gibraltar and
Cyprus, an army unit (now being re-
duced) in Libya, light bombers and
other aircraft in Cyprus, and occasional
naval patrols.
South of Suez
South of Suez an armed battalion
will remain for some time in Swaziland,
which is some three thousand miles
from the nearest military aid to the
south-west, that of the Caribbean and
the South Atlantic. In the former a
small force of frigates patrols the waters
and an infantry company is quartered
in British Honduras. Further south the
patrol ship, HMS Protector, broods over
the Falkland Islands and makes occa-
sional forays into the Antarctic. Even
these small forces will be cut in the
next defence budget.
East of Suez
East of Suez the most important
withdrawal of British forces is from
Aden, in which some 10,000 men,
mostly of the Royal Marine Com-
mando, aircraft carriers, frigates,
ground-attack, and fighter - recon-
naisance aircraft will be involved. Even
with a small increase in forces in the
Persian Gulf, the British Government
aims to save $lOO million from this
move.
When Britain quits Aden there will
be nothing left of British ground forces
east of Suez ex cept the relatively small
Persian Gulf units, a few scattered
maintenance engineers, and guards on
RAAF staging post islands in the
Indian Ocean such as Gan and the
Cocos Islands, and the military forces
in Malaysia and Singapore.
Of greatest concern to Australia is
the continual agitation in Britain for
abandonment of the Singapore base
and complete evacuation of Malaysia.
The Far Eastern Command controls
more than 30,000 troops, destroyers
(including some with guided missiles)
frigates, submarines, and support ships,
light bombers and a variety of trans-
port, ground-attack, medium, and
short-range aircraft.
There will be some reductions at
these bases over the next few years, but
Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Healey on his Aus-
tralian visit, have affirmed their deter-
mination to remain East of Suez and
even beyond the temple bells and the
old Moulmein pagoda.
Although not forever, and not with-
out financial assistance. Australia will
be called in to make an offer before the
next British defence budget is tabled.
Phase one of the reductions in the
Far East, providing for the return of
10,000 men from Borneo, is almost com-
pleted and Mr. Healey recently an-
nounced that between 5000 and 10,000
will follow from Malaya and Singapore.
The final figure will depend on what
Australia and New Zealand are pre-
pared to contribute.
Left of Wilson
Exactly what Britain does depends on
political pressures in London. A number
of Labor backbenchers, including Mr.
Christopher Mayhew, former Minister
for the Navy, are clamoring that there
is little correspondence between the
vague policy assurances Cabinet gives
in the party room and the specific
actions of the Defence Ministry. With
one voice Mr. Healey promises them
that it is not the “aim of the Govern-
ment to undertake the role of military
protector”, of small and middle-size
nations outside Europe in the future,
and then, in a more cautionary tone,
he tells them that “in the crisis created
by Indonesian confrontation Britain
showed what it can do for international,
stability.”
The apparent contradictions may be
explained by the fact that the Wilson
Cabinet is being forced to reshuffle its
defence set-up for economic more than
foreign policy reasons. The motives of
the Left-ideologues of the Labor Party
and the disappointed imperialists of
the Tories are the reverse.
The Exchequer has convinced Cabi-
net that the British economy cannot
bear a defence burden greater than
£2OOO million, and the question for
the Defence Ministry is what part of
its present commitments and likely
future demands on its services can it
proceed with under this handicap? A
couple of years ago defence costs
“galloping like a runaway horse,” said
Mr. Healey were £2400 million and
prices have risen since.
Paradoxically, the British Labor
Cabinet is willing to take up Kipling’s
“White Man’s Burden,” at least in terms
of defence, but it is not able to “reap
his old reward.”

Return to the pregnant images
By APRIL HERSEY
PAINTER JOHN OLSEN is back in
Australia, the country that he finds
“alive with pregnant images.” He is
glad to be back and anxious to start
working here again.
Travelling en famille wbth two small
children is a nerve-racking affair, par-
ticularly, one suspects, for the children.
Both of his children, Olsen intimated,
became traumatic at the sight of a gal-
lery or a cathedral in the final stages
of the tour. Only the fact that they
found major galleries acoustically ideal
for shouting games saved their childish
reason in the presence of El Grecos.
To be fair, the journey was never
meant to be a saga of family travel.
It began when Olsen was commissioned
by a London woman to provide one
of his “sunny ceilings” for a dark
Georgian mansion. He flew off for three
months “with his head supposedly ftdl
of sunny Australian images” to complete
die assignment. It occurred to him while
mspended on a scaffold under the ceil-
ing that the family should join him. He
particularly wanted his wife to see
Spain, which had been the centre of
his previous visit to Europe.
Unfortunately, as they sped through
the South of France toward the border,
the steering in Olsen's car failed and
he smashed into a tree. Injuries were
M iious enough to put all four people
into hospital, where minimum French
M-rved only to confuse the natives. The
artist’s right arm w'as broken and out
of action for nine months, necessitating
specialist treatment in London to save
it.
When the Olsens finally limped on
<> Spain, the dreams of the ’fifties had
been updated into a nightmare of
imperfect plumbing and determined
modernisation. “The honeymoon is
liver,’’ Olsen said. “Spain is quite spoilt
now. They are so keen to catch up
with civilisation that they are losing all
their old ways. We had tw'o bathrooms
in our villa with magnificent taps but
no water.”
However, Portugal was all that he
sought. In the village of Portelegre on
the Spanish border, the cobbler still sat
in the doorway to work, the donkeys
labored past, the smith tended his fire,
and the olive groves surrounded the
bone-white houses. Best of all, in an
old Jesuit monastery, one hundred
weavers, possibly the largest group of
hand-weavers in the world, labored
with intense preoccupation at their
craft.
A combination of this traditional
ability for handwork and the skills of
a group of highly trained chemists who
have perfected dyeing techniques make
Portelegre (once the escape route from
Spain’s Inquisitors) a centre in the
renaissance of tapestry.
“There is a real need for tapestry
now,” Olsen said. “Particularly since
buildings have only a planned period
of usefulness. It isn’t sensible to com-
mission an important mural any longer,
but a tapestry can just be rolled up and
carried to the next stage of functional
architecture.”
Despite his awkward arm, Olsen de-
signed some major tapestries while in
Portugal. “These weavers are working
in the same style as the superb early
tapestries—the Unicorn tapestry style—
but they have the vivid colors of
modern chemistry. It was wonderful
working with them. Every morning
we held a conference about the work.
In the early stages I was the listener.
It ceased to be my work and became
our work. This was a new experience
for someone who previously, until hand-
ing over the design, had danced the
floor as God.
“The Portuguese weave vertically in-
stead of horizontally. This means that
instead of the tapestry being rolled
off the loom as it is completed, the
whole piece and any mistakes can be
seen from the beginning. Mistakes
are inevitable in a large work. This
way they can be seen at once by the
artist. On a horizontal loom the whole
piece has to be redone, or a sort of
darning effect used to cover a mistake.”
Olsen enjoyed his sojourn in Portugal
but he prefers to live in Australia, con-
sidering that the new world in Em ope
is generally badly done. He feels
strongly that any artist is in jeopardy
who forgets his roots, w'hether he likes
them or not. “They are the grist of
our life. All true art begins in being
provincial. Picasso is Spain. When
you are there you see him in so many
places. Matisse is French, and Modig-
liani Italian. Though they all moved
about the world they never let this root
die.
“When we arrived in Western Aus-
tralia we went to see the Perth Prize,”
he said. “And I couldn’t believe I was
seeing all those second-rate imitations.
One always has a clearer, more splen-
did vision for a little while after re-
turning from overseas. I can’t tell
you what it did to me to see that
mediocre art —and outside the gallery
that truly Australian light and unique
John Olsen
gum trees. When I was in Portugal
there were gum trees outside the village
and I used to fill the car with branches
and drive home wondering what the
hell I was doing away from Australia.”
Olsen feels that the Australian
private galleries are the best in the
world. His next exhibition will be with
the Clune Galleries, but he has ex-
hibited with many local galleries.
“We are looked after like pampered
children,” he said. “The galleries in
London and New York are run by big
business enterprises. The artist would
rarely see the director, far less be sus-
tained through a six months’ desert of
lack of inspiration. It isn’t unusual for
them to take 75 percent of a fee, and
50 percent is normal. There, is nothing
personal in the relationship.”
Olsen admits having periods of non-
production, and the space under his
house at Watson’s Bay is packed with
canvases which will “never see the
light of day.”
He takes his ceilings very seriously.
Though it may not be true that
he once wanted to carry the ceiling
treatment down the walls of a dining-
room and provide a mirrored table so
that the diners were actually inside an
Olsen painting, his lively face took on
a stern expression when I admitted
never having seen an Olsen ceiling.
“Frank,” he told Frank McDonald, of
Clune Galleries, first man to commis-
sion a ceiling, “she has never seen one
of mv ceilings.” There was a pause
pregnant with images. Then McDonald,
in the midst of the chaos of both
moving house and setting up the gallery
in new premises in Macquarie Street,
said with admirable restraint and in
the true spirit of the noble Australian
gallery men, “Well, do come and see
mine.”


Hail Gloria Dawn
By JANE RANDOLPH
IF YOU HAVE ever lived in the
country you will be familiar with the
particular magic that the travelling
tent show brings with it, a transient
magic comprised of loud music, lights,
greasepaint, and talent, appearing for
one night in a transformed paddock.
Most of these shows have vanished
now leaving the field to the teenage
pop shows and the Young Elizabethans,
but out of that rather garish world have
come many hard-working performers
who know Australia like the back of
their hands. One of them is blonde,
business-like Gloria Dawn, appearing
in “Hail Gloria Fitzpatrick” at the
Phillip Theatre.
“Eve never had any training,” she
said. “I don’t know exactly why, but I
suppose my family thought appearing
would be enough.” Appear she did
from the age of five with her parents,
Billy Andros and Zilla Wheatley, in a
comedy-and-magic act. When she was
ten she was included in their Tivoli
act and began busily touring with them
on the circuit. By the time she was
14 and had filled out satisfactorily, she
was a soubrette.
She was on stage one way and an-
other for the next 20 years. When she
was 18 she was starring in Will
Mahoney’s production of “Sunny” and
appearing for him in “Little Nelly
Kelly” at Brisbane’s Cremorne Theatre.
She also worked with Jack Davey
travelling the country as part of the
“warm up” for his quiz shows. She
was part of radio’s variety world and
there were always the tent shows,
notably George Sorlie’s which battled
Gloria Dawn
through the outback and up as far as
Townsville, Rockhampton, and Mackay.
Gloria and her husband, Frank Cleary,
a juggler and comedian, with their
three children, travelled in a caravan.
“The caravan was home to us for
years,” Gloria said. “We still have it,
though we have bought an old home
in Sydney so that we can put down
some roots.” Her two daughters, aged
15 and 10 are both interested in show-
business, but the eldest son, now 19,
has settled for a bank job.
“I never put the theatre first,”
Gloria said. “It doesn’t have the excite-
ment and glamor for me that'it might
have for a beginner. It’s really hard
work. It’s a business like any other.”
The children accept showbusiness
just as Gloria herself accepted it,
though she does try to shut the door
on it all once she is home and they
all watch television devotedly, while
she knits.
She has been on television herself,
in the first “Sydney Tonight” shows on
Channel 7 and also in a Melbourne
variety show. She acted in “The Amor-
ous Prawn” on stage, her first non-sing-
ing part, and appeared with half the
rest of Australia in “They’re a Weird
Mob.” (She was the charwoman who
hadn’t been paid.) Her phenomenal
run in “A Cup of Tea, a Bex and a
Good Lie Down” at the Phillip and
her appearances as Annie in “Annie
Get Your Gun” at Warringah have led
to this tailored part in “Hail Gloria
Fitzpatrick.”
For someone who thought nothing of
making 20 entrances in a bill which
held 25 items in the hard years when
she was gaining experience, why
shouldn’t it be just another part?
“Nowadays it’s hard for young people
to get that sort of experience,” she
said. “They can either sing or dance
or speak or they can play an instru-
ment—but they can’t do the lot. If
there was one thing you had to be,
somewhere out in the back of Bourke,
it was adaptable.”
Television
Beauty queens
By FRANK ROBERTS
DURING THE current television
hiatus, when even “McGooley” begins
to look preferable to repeats of films
and series still too fresh in the mind
to watch again, documentaries from
British, American, French, and Italian
television have been the rocks on
which the medium remained standing.
For my part, this has been an excel-
lent thing. Costly, well-made docu-
mentaries such as Italy’s four-part
“Land of the Pharaohs,” Britain’s
“Greece Without Columns,” and
America’s “Aviation Revolution,” and
“Stravinsky” would have been worth
viewing at any time, but in the present
context have been lifesavers.
When an overseas documentary with
merits of its own can be related to
current events in Australia its value is
more than doubled. This was evident
in two recent weeks, when Cardin was
showing his fashions around Australia
and Alan Whicker, of the BBC, took
us behind the hectic scenes of high-
fashion shindigs in Paris, asking Cardin
and others cheeky questions; and when
Miss Australia
the Miss Pacific finals in Melbourne
were followed by another Whicker
review of the beauty queen circuit
in Britain, shown immediately after-
wards in Sydney but separated by a
movie in Melbourne.
The Whicker documentaries have a
style of their own, mostly due to his
way of inserting Everyman’s questions
into the scene (“Why do you bother?”
for instance), but some of their
strength also comes from imaginative
direction by Jack Gold and an excellent
camera team. As additional material
for Channel 9’s “Project ’67,” their
only bothersome factor has been quality
such as the local team will find hard
to equal. And as shows made for a
BBC “Tonight” program, they give
the ABC’s coming show of the same
name something to live up to. Whicker
has shown that a magazine program
can inform and entertain, if enough
money, wit, and imagination go into
it.
Watching the “Miss Pacific” telecast
was as deadly as viewing any of the
Miss Australia finals, with two excep-
tions. In this instance the sponsors
were not seated ringside, nor treated
as minor deities. They had to do their
own huckstering in a more normal
and less sickening way. And the girls
were beautiful.
But as an event staged particularly
for television, to be shown in numerous
countries to encourage friendship and
tourist interchange, it was almost
laughable. Are we asking them in
Hawaii and California to assume that
Bert Newton’s accents represent the
Australian way of speaking? Or in
Japan that this represents the Aus-
tralian idea of how to present a TV

Art
Father figures
By ELWYN LYNN
Young Contemporaries. Blaxland Gal-
leries, Sydney.
Josef Albers. Central Street Gallery,
Sydney.
Easter Exhibition. Hungry Horse Gal-
lery, Sydney.
WITH A FATHER-FIGURE of the
hard-edge-color-field-optical movement
in Albers, an array of noted and
middle-generation artists at the Hungry
Horse, and an unbridled lot of under
35s at the Blaxland, there’s a fine
chance this w'eek for the critic to
motalise on the generations, on the ex-
pediency of having a remote and
hardly competitive father-figure like
Albers or Fairweather, and on the older
viewers w'ho forget the virtues of
maturity in their anxiety to be with
what is often superficial, vacuous, and
ephemeral. The way from art school
to participation in shows for the young,
and then entry into the dealer’s sanc-
tum, is now so smooth that the young
expect the adulation of their elders
and grow bitter about anything re-
sembling cautious praise.
Yet the experienced, if youthful hand
of Whiteley in a folding triptych of
multiple, irrational imagery at the
Hungry Horse should remind us that
if maturity has little to do with age
(consider Picasso’s and Braque’s
cubism) it has a lot to do with experi-
ence in death, and what looks throw-
away in Whiteley’s collage of w'ords,
photographs, and a weird hair-do of
fairy - floss has the professional
amateurishness of the best English Pop.
Whiteley is many muddy miles from
Albers’ Bauhaus hygiene; and if one
were to judge Albers by his superficial
exercises in color theory at the Central,
he could hardly rate as a father-figure.
So obsessed is he wdth color that he
ignores obvious Gestaltian movement of
forms, where color is irrelevant. These
elementary lessons • explain nothing
about his excellent works in black and
w'hite or what happens in his Homages
to the Square, where color relations are
so intuitive as to defy analysis. Perhaps
he knows it’s more complex, for he’s
said, “I consider ethics and aesthetics
one!”
Eccentric? Another father-figure, Ad
Reinhardt, who deals in squares of
black or near black symmetrically and
almost invisibly trisected, says much
the same in his anti-color manifestoes:
“There is something wrong, irrespon-
sible, and meaningless about color,
something impossible to control. Con-
trol and rationality are part of any
morality.”
He’s hardly the father-figure for the
gay and sprightly youngsters at the
Blaxland, w'here many an international
mode is tackled with an unabashed
gusto that has none of the caution and
subterfuge of five years ago. Many do
homage to the heroes of space, Harpur
coolly and Aspden, in his own pecu-
liarly luminous manner, to Newman;
Treweeke, in a subtly pulsating yellow
box proliferating nodules on shifting-
pink, to Matisse; Colin and Merilyn
Spencer (nee Neate) to Rose Selevay
(nee Duchamp) with an actual cot
containing plastic roses and a blue,
bandaged mummy-figure slung below.
Su Archer does the writhing cobra-
collage twist engagingly; Jennifer Bar-
well employs a cool Kandinskian
sprightliness, and Firth Smith and
Philip Cox take broad views of sea-
scapes; there are some homely kitchen
pieces of actual taps and a table set
for breakfast all such high-spirited,
iconoclastic, and elegant fun that
oblique references to surrealism Saxton
and Cleveland look odd and, to some,
still odder the $4OO prize going to Gary
Shead’s expressionist, Soutinely dis-
torted figure rather weedy and uncon-
trolled like the garden he’s standing in.
The pinkish, sliding flesh and dull, sour
greens are disposed with such a sense
of scale that they ought to make the
hard-edgers look twice; so should all at
Earle’s lyrical, beautifully undemonstra-
tive, and unpedantic bit of “Ecole-de
Paris.”
The week's wanner is Nolan's fugi-
tive, fawn baboon on sweetly liquescent
ground at the Hungry Horse; from the
most imprecise contours and sour-
sw'eet colors he w'afts up an unforget-
table image.
Films
Misfortune cookie
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Fortune Cookie. Director Billy
Wilder.
BILLY WILDER produced and direc-
ted “The Fortune Cookie,” as well as
collaborating on the script, so that
there’s really nobody else to blame for
the dismal failure of a promising idea.
This story of a shady lawyer’s
attempt to inflate the slight accidental
injury of his brother-in-law into a mil-
lion-dollar suit for damages would seem
ideally suited to Wilder’s jaundiced
view of human nature, and indeed he
shows to best advantage in his writing
capacity the script (written with I.
A. L. Diamond) has moments of sharp
humor. Nor is there anything to com-
plain of in the acting. It’s the presenta-
tion and direction that are so incredibly
ham-handed.
Wilder has chopped his overlong
film into sections, each with a sort of
chapter-heading “The Accident,”
“The Caper,” “The Gemini Plan,”
etc. which automatically interrupts
any dramatic impetus and reduces it
to a series of one-act sketches. Maybe
that’s what Wilder intended, though
I’d be at a loss to say why; the final
effect is clumsy and fidgety, with no
real dramatic climax.
The film’s redeeming feature is its
acting which, unlike the rest, is highly
professional, and Walter Matthau’s per-
formance as the conniving lawyer, with
his hungry eyes fixed unswervingly on
the fast buck, is a masterpiece of
comedy timing.
Theatre
Cinderella song
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Half a Sixpence. David Heneker.
Comedy, Melbourne.
A Flea in Her Ear. George Feydeau.
Russell St., Melbourne.
BEFORE THE EVENT, “Half a Six-
pence” looked particularly ominous. A
musical based on H. G. Wells’ “Kipps”
by so.meone called David Heneker . . .
could one get excited about that?
Tommy Steele had starred in the
original production, but if the “tinga-
lingalingering” score contained a hit,
it was a well-kept secret. However,
surprisingly it is a very good musical
indeed, and Mark McManus did for
Tommy Steele what Jill Perryman did
for Streisand.
Max Oldaker played the actor-play-
wright Chitterlow, and for some reason
brought maulings from every daily
Press critic—even the ones who usually
smile benignly on a production while
more fastidious patrons wreck the.
theatre. Generally he was accused of
his character’s failings (i.e., hamminess)
which seems a little unfair. In fact,
the main flaws were Carole Walker’s
frail performance as Kipps’ steadfast
girlfriend, and the tatty sets by some-
one suitable anonymous.
George (3gilvy’s production of Fey-
deau’s farce “A Flea in Her Ear” is a
great success. The translation (by John
Mortimer) is liberally sprinkled with
verbal graffiti, Kristian Frederikson’s
sets and costu.mes couldn’t have been
more Art Noveau if Beardsley himself
had done them, and the sexual en-
counters of the fifteen characters are

dizzying and complex. To have worked
out the permutations and combinations,
Feydeau must have had access to an
Art Noveau computer.
Many of the performances were
splendid, but as the characters have
names as elaborate as the plot
(Lucienne Homenides de Hisangua,
etc.), there’s only room to single out
three. David Turnbull juggled his two
contrasting roles brilliantly. Denis
Olsen played his insanely jealous

Negro on the run
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Slow Dance on the Killing Ground.
William Hanley. Ensemble Theatre.
Sydney.
Hail Gloria Fitzpatrick. John McKellar,
Sybil Graham, Tim Walles. Phillip
Theatre, Sydney.
A NEGRO on the run takes refuge in
a candy store in Brooklyn which is
kept by a German emigrant. He is
equipped with a nasty looking spike
and an umbrella with a sharpened
ferrule. It is late in the evening and
there is nobody else about, at least
not until the end of Act 1, when
Rosie comes rushing in and crashes
to the floor in a dead faint.
The three characters circle about the
stage in a slow, tense ballet, punctu-
ated by sudden rushes and bursts of
comedy. Gradually their probleniN
emerge, problems of a magnitude to
qualify them for parts in high trageds:
Randall, the Negro, has killed his
mother, Mr. Glas, the German, aban-
doned his Jewish wife and child in
Nazi Germany, and Rosie is on her
way to an abortionist. But the level
of treatment is that of Alfred Hitch-
cock’s and, on this level, the play is
tautly constructed and grips the atten-
tion.
Under the direction of Hayes Gor-
don the three non-professional actors
sustain the suspense throughout a
difficult exercise in acting. Evelyn
Cornelius has the easiest task, playing
the open-hearted Jewish girl, which
she does well. Joe Richardson looks
and moves convincingly as the Negro.
In “Hail Gloria Fitzpatrick" John
McKellar has tried to combine musical
comedy and revue, but has not suc-
ceeded in welding together these two
different forms. The macabre but funny
sketch about “Four Lady Bowlers in a
Golden Holden," for instance, has
absolutely no connection with the
tenuous plot.
In fact, the show is held together
solely by the bright and energetic
presence of Gloria Dawn.

What ever happened
to Bette Davis?
By CHARLES HIGHAM
The Films of Bette Davis. Gene Ring-
gold. Citadel Press. $3.95.
Bogey; The Films of Humphrey Bogart.
Clifford McCarty. Citadel Press.
$4.95.
PERHAPS THE MOST striking single
feature of Bette Davis’ career dealt
with in pictures and text in Gene
Ringgold’s impeccably researched and
finely produced volume—was the extent
of the cultural overtones attaching to
her various roles.
In “The Letter,” based on Somerset
Maugham’s play, she was admittedly
restricted to embroidery, but later she
developed far more advanced skills.
In “A Stolen Life” she was a painter,
sufficiently impressive to draw —on her
first exhibition in Boston—a comment
from Sylvester Pringle, “foremost art
critic of New England”: “Excellent . . .
a touch of Rousseau?” In “Winter
Meeting,” she wrote poetry (sub-Emily
Dickinson, to judge by the snatches of
text read on the soundtrack), but win-
ner of rave reviews from the highbrow
Press. In “Old Acquaintance” she was
Kit Marlowe (get the literary refer-
ence?), a novelist of quality, competing
with her childhood friend Millie
(Miriam Hopkins) in the fiction stakes:
“Millie’s success” (Mr. Ringgold re-
minds us) “(with her first novel) sparks
her to continue writing and for a decade
she produces a continuous flow of pot-
boilers while Kit dedicates her talent
to worthwhile creations.”
Admittedly, in “June Bride” Miss
Davis was a mere journalist, preparing
the summer edition of a slick women’s
magazine in midwinter from a fur-
lined office chair and a desk bristling
with sharpened pencils and telephones
in a setting as far removed as possible
from THE BULLETIN’S. But in
“Deception” she again reached the
heights as a pianist, playing the “Moon-
light Sonata” to her guests at a party
to celebrate her marriage to a cellist,
while her jilted lover, the most famous
composer in America, Alexander Hol-
lenius (Claude Rains), smashes a
brandy glass in his fury.
Bette Davis’ best films were in
the ’forties, and Mr. Ringgold’s book
brings them back with splendid vivid-
ness. One regrets the absence from the
screen of an actress whose poise, pre-
cision, and attack, whose taut inten-
sity and drive have not been equalled
in the cinema’s history: how much
more likable she is than the end-
lessly mooning Garbo, or even the
craggy Joan Crawford! She opened
the ’forties with a bang in “The Letter”
—literally. William Wyler’s brilliant
direction started the film with a series
of bold dramatic strokes, establishing
an atmosphere of a tropical tension
and violence. We are in a plantation
in Malaya: rubber drips from a tree,
the moon scuds behind palms, coolies
toss restlessly in hammocks. Suddenly,
shots echo from the plantation house
veranda; a white cockatoo flaps
startled off a fence; coolies run. Leslie
Crosby (Davis) walks out, firing at the
white-coated figure of her lover. She
looks up at the moon, her eyes haunted,
shining with its light.
From this opening sequence on, the
film is masterly. Maugham’s story of
a planter’s wife who kills her lover
and is saved from death by her tor-
mented counsel is re-created in bril-
liant detail. Two motifs bind the work
together: the moon, which holds an
intense fascination for the murderess;
and her lace bedspread stitched oval
by tiny oval through trial and sub-
sequent confession, at once an ironic
comment on her marriage, a symbol of
her amazing willpower—her ability to
build piece by piece a complex pat-
tern of deceit —and a method by which
she steadies her nerves to face the
ordeal. Playing with extraordinary con-
centration and control, Bette Davis in
this film gave the finest performance of
her career.
She was admirable, too, in the silly
“Now Voyager.” As Charlotte Vale,
Ugly Duckling of a rich Boston Back
Bay family, she collapses into nervous
breakdown because of sexual repres-
sion and a dominating mother. She
finds a confidant in America’s foremost
psychiatrist, Dr. Jacquith, who suggests
a spell at his private sanatorium in the
country, Cascade (“As people go to
the seashore, they come there!”). Pre-
senting Charlotte with a phrase from
Whitman (“Now voyager, go forth to
seek and find”), Jacquith sends her off
on a cruise to South America. On board
she meets Jerry (Paul Henreid), an
architect with a Continental accent and
a habit of putting two cigarettes in
his mouth at once, lighting them and
Bette Davis
passing one to his partner. While tour-
ing Rio, their taxi breaks down and
they “bundle” for the night. Charlotte
is cured of her inhibitions, and emerges
as near to beautiful as cameramen and
make-up men can manage.
This piffle is delivered with the
ultimate in gloss; Bette Davis manages
to give verisimilitude to a character
straight out of “Redbook.” She did the
same in “Mr. Skeffington”: in this, she
is meant to be a woman so pretty she
can bring a whole flock of men to the
foot of a staircase when she descends it;
married to a Jewish banker who loses
his sight in a concentration camp, she,
in turn, loses her looks and her hair
through diphtheria. Since he can no
longer see her, to him she is always
beautiful!
But my favorite Bette Davis picture
is “Deception,” a masterpiece of
glorious absurdity. Like so many ’forties
films and it was echt ’forties it
featured a concerto, this time for the
cello, composed by Hollenius, whose
mistress (Davis) deserts him for a
cellist. John Collier’s script is delirious:
greeted outside a New York concert hall
after playing (rather badly) the Haydn
Cello Concerto, the cellist Novak is
greeted by the music editor of the
“Bugle.” The interview goes as follows:
“Mr. Novak, which of the living com-
posers do you think I ought to ad-
mire?” “Well, er, there is no greatest
among the really great.” “Whom do
you like, Hollenius, Shostakovitch?”
‘‘Let’s see. Stravinsky when I think of
the present. Richard Strauss when I
think of the past. And, of course, Hol-
lenius, who combines the rhythm of
today with the melody of yesterday.”
Sadly, as Mr. Ringgold’s book shows,
Bette Davis’ career really didn’t survive
the mid-’fifties. Cast in a succession of
unrewarding roles, she became regarded
in Hollywood more and more as a kind


of monstre sacre ou damne, finally cast
in Robert Aldrich’s “Whatever Hap-
pened to Baby Jane?” and “Hush,
Hush, Sweet Charlotte” as little better
than a freak. She made both parts won-
derfully convincing, of course, and the
films themselves were the best from
Hollywood for years the first of the
two, in particular, was a triumph of
the pathetic and the macabre. But for
Bette Davis whose expletives after
the Cannes showing of “Baby Jane” are
legendary in Hollywood it must
have seemed very much like the end
of the road. The new, streamlined, cold
machine that Hollywood is has very
little room for the kind of idiosyncratic
genius that Bette Davis always was.
Bogart, perhaps fortunately, did not
live to see the end of his own era.
Tough yet genial, wry but not cynical,
he was in the earlier ’sixties the idol
of the campuses, his old films irresistibly
High Camp. The most immediate of
all the stars, he gave one the impression
of having known him personally for
years. The chain-smoking, the whisky-
soured breath, the eyes that had seen
everything: he was born to play Ray-
mond Chandler’s Phillip Marlowe and
Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade. As
McCarty’s wonderful picture - book
makes clear once again, Bogey was
in “The Maltese Falcon,” pitted against
the tearfully schoolgirlish, endlessly de-
ceiving Mary Astor (“Dangerous . . .?”
“Very”), and the gross, pansyish Syd-
ney Greenstreet, and in Michael
Curtiz’s masterpiece of kitsch, “Casa-
blanca” much more than a star: a
very good actor as well.

MAN AND SHOWMAN? With a repu-
tation like Brendan Behan’s one is
inclined to fear that the showman will
overcome the man. But it is not so,
and at the end of this heartening
book one may even wonder whether
there was a showman in it. There
was. With admirable tact, Mrs. Jeffs
admits him unblinkingly enough: the
triumphs very few, the too frequent
rages and disgraces, the violent inepti-
tude. The result is a plain and con-
vincing picture, warts and all, not to
amuse us or affront us, not for the
limelight or for the dreary record, but
to cheer us, for Brendan Behan was,
like the Smith Family, for humanity.
We may read this book at a sitting,
not because it is a great book, but be-
cause it delights and fascinates. The
narrative is in excellent control, un-
forced, clear, quietly compelling.
It has, of course, the attraction of
a lost cause. What makes a man, so
fond of life, drink himself to death?
Is it self-display, obstreperousness, a
rebel training in the IRA, the need
for company, shame at letting down his
wife and friends, doubt of his own
abilities, a craving and weakness of
will, always thinking to burst out into
sudden blaze, the sudden blaze of fame
itself? All these explanations are in
this book, but none is insisted on.
It is not the intention of the book
to explain, or palliate, or insist. There
is no palpable design upon us. Mrs.
Jeffs at once modestly disclaims that
she is writing gospel. Brendan—he is
always Brendan, and this is not cosiness
but necessity asked her to be his
biographer, and here she is setting down
firmly and plainly what she knows.
The reader trusts her.
We are in company with a man
who, like Colley Cibber, seems to have
lived his life in order to write it. From
the age of four, he said, he could think
of no career except that of writer. Even
when he writes to British Railways he
has an eye beyond his correspondent
and is shooting at posterity, in the
name of God, as he might say.
I wasn’t one of those who felt very
sad when Brendan Behan died in
March, 1964, but I see I was wrong.
Not only was his noise excessive, and
his bashing of bottles: his kindness also
was. And he could unleash a living
sentence, a thing possible to few.
Many men, including plenty of Scots-
men, are kept away from Burns by the
same dust of tomfoolery and adulation
as surrounds Behan, only far more so
and for longer. Such men are judging
shrewdly, but they are judging, not the
writer, but the asinine admirers. With
Burns, they are preventing themselves
from seeing with joy that though he
was too ready with his pen he never-
theless wrote a larger quantity of living
poetry than all but some dozen people
who have ever written poetry in Eng-
lish.
First published in 1950, this book on
him is already well known. David
Daiches is quick and of commanding
grasp, capable of a magisterial judg-
ment on any literary theme, as here
in his opening chapter on the dualism
of Scottish 18th-century culture. But
he barely tarries to give his judgments.
It is as if he were reviewing. His
criticism is prepared for lectures and
it is his lectures that are slapped into
book form while he is himself involved
in some other lecturing task. He is
like Jupiter or Orion, not there. While
the light has been travelling, so have
they.
The poems are anticipated, the brisk
comment dutifully intervenes, because,
like the announcer at the football
match, the lecturer is there to help.
The tension here is not in the packed
phrase but in the poem. It cannot
have any tension if it is presented,
like the mangled body of Osiris, with
large chunks of critical desert in be-
tween: even if, as often happens, the
desert should blossom as the rose. This
book is stimulating, even valuable, but
it is also patchy and irritating. One
sees that it only needed time and
attention to be a real book.
A poet who has suffered the living
death of becoming the institution of
people who love poetry once a year
needs his champions urgently. He has
one in MacDiarmid—“While still to
thee, O Burns/The punctual stomach of
thy people turns.” He has another in
Professor Daiches.
Sphinxes of Finance
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Merchant Bankers. Joseph Wechs-
berg. Weidenfeld and Nicolson. $6.15.
NEARLY A HUNDRED years ago
Walter Bagehot said of the great mer-
chant bankers in the City of London,
“We must not let daylight in upon
magic.” Since then the fierce light of
publicity has still illumined only a few-
stray corners of those studiously old-
fashioned, richly panelled, fire-lit build-
ings round Lombard Street, wherein
people with legendary names like
Rothschild, Baring, Hambro, and
Lazard spin webs whose filaments, un-
seen and unheard of by the innocent
public, penetrate every corner of the
financial world.
Some of the power and mystery has
evaporated in the 20th century. It is
no longer true that, as an 18th century
French statesman remarked, “There are
six great powers in Europe: England,
France, Russia, Austria, Prussia, and
the Baring Brothers.” The City of
London no longer finances wars and
revolutions, crowns and uncrowns kings,
and underwrites entire States. Mergers,
takeovers, and the money juggling of
industrial empires now absorb the
wizards of the merchant banking
houses. Instead of kings, presidents, and
parliaments, their clients are tycoons in
oil, shipping, and plastics. But what-
ever their activities, the same shroud of
silent, suave, impeccable discretion con-
ceals them all.
Foreigners originally, most of the
merchant bankers, they came from all
over old mercantile Europe, scenting
out with sure instinct the rising im-
perial power of Britain —the Roths-
childs from the money-changers in the
Frankfurt ghetto, the Barings from the
warehouses of Bremen, the Hambros
from selling salt meat to ships’ chand-
lers on the quays of Copenhagen. By
the time of the Napoleonic Wars, with
slight assistance from their native Eng-
lish counterparts, they had made Lon-
don the money market of the world.
They became enormously rich and their


Painful
Hemorrhoids
It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-
gers. Piles (hemorrhoids) are aggra-
vated by many factors—including
over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief —invites serious medical conse-
quences. Eight years’ Swiss research
developed Varemoid Tablets—now
regarded by overseas specialists as the
leading anti-inflammatory treatment
for piles. Remarkable improvement is
being achieved—even with sufferers
of over 20 years. A week’s course
will convince you.
Ask your family chemist for Varemoid.

descendants were ennobled (five
separate peerages in the Baring family
alone) for their services in providing
the gold that armed British trade and
foreign policy around the globe.
Yet thousands of history books about
the 18th and 19th centuries never even
mention the names of the financial
dynasties whose power was mightier
than any army or conquering general.
A few notably dramatic episodes reach
the text books, like Disraeli summoning
the Rothschilds to help him buy the
Suez Canal shares. But the share of
the Hambros in financing the Italian
Risorgimento, the role of the Barings
in keeping Britain’s allies afloat in the
struggle against Napoleon—this is the
stuff of history too often ignored by the
chroniclers of campaigns and politics.
One difficulty, as Joseph Wechsberg
points out in his book, is the intense
secretiveness of the lords of London
haute finance. No one has ever been
allowed to examine the Rothschild
family archives. For generations the
merchant bankers, bill brokers, bullion
traders, and what Paul Ferris called
“the other slightly esoteric creatures of
the city jungle” have presented a
sphinx-like face to all inquiries. They
speak a jargon compared with which
that of lawyers and philosophers is as
the lisping of a child.
Wechsberg’s book is entertaining
reading, but one can see the difficulties
he was up against. The younger part-
ners of the famous houses were all
terribly nice to him. They plied him
with superb sherry and lunched him
in historic boardrooms beneath por-
traits of royalty and framed cheques
for millions of pounds. The Rothschilds
allowed him to witness the archaic
daily ceremony of “fixing the price of
gold” in their official capacity as gold
brokers to the Bank of England, and
showed him the private refinery where
they still make gold bars in an old
building near the Tower. But Wechs-
berg never really penetrated far behind
the facade of that strange, clannish,
silkily smooth running organisation that
controls the heart of the sterling world.
His book is superficial compared with,
for instance, Paul Ferris’ “The City,”
written in the 19505, a coldly unroman-
tic account of what makes the City tick
and how the merchant bankers really
earn their money.
Wechsberg, however, covers a wider
canvas and he has some readable chap-
ters on the American and Continental
bankers, few of whom, it appears, view
publicity with the elegant distaste of
their London compeers.
Raffaele Mattioli, boss of the Banca
Commerciale d’ltalia, is a true heir of
the Medici patron of the arts, pub-
lisher of fine books, collector of paint-
ings, translator of Coleridge and
Shakespeare. From his sumptuous office
in Milan he has a finger in every
Italian enterprise from films to irri-
gation works in the depressed Mezzo-
giorno. Herman Abs, the wizard of the
Deutsche Bank behind West Germany’s
miraculous economic recovery, is an
organist who loves Bach. The Lehman
brothers built themselves the fastest-
growing financial empire on Wall Street
by taking risks on such far-out enter-
prises as moving pictures and five-and-
ten cent stores that the conservative
bankers wouldn’t touch.
Economists may not learn much
from “The Merchant Bankers” but it
is a lively and well-written piece of
journalese that certainly stimulates a
curiosity to learn more about those busy,
bowler-hatted* moles of the City of
London.
Some Sort of Spring
Open the door and let the world inside:
Three weeks of rain have suddenly broken clear
Into a blue sky. Children and birds
Strike individual notes from the backyard
Like praise for a particular event.
The morning one reads has published
Our own resolution of a time of trial.
Last night, after days and nights of strain,
We came together again, under no moon,
On the big bed, hearing the last of the wind
Rasp in the eaves. We slept like the just
Reprieved, linked still by touch and breath
And folded warmth. Then woke as though
The pod of ourselves had burst and all
That warmth succored the neighborhood;
Children, and birds and the sizzle of breakfast
Choiring the morning. Some sort of Spring,
It is easy enough to believe.
Open the door and let the world inside.
LOUIS JOHNSON


BUSINESS
AND FINANCE
Haywire for banks?
ISN’T IT STRANGE! Here we have the banks being
allowed to lend money unsecured so people won’t need to
borrow from hire-purchase companies when they buy their
cars or television sets or furniture, while at the same time
the hire-purchase companies have been falling over them-
selves to lend more to industry, formerly the preserve of
the banks. Has the system gone haywire? The answer is
“yes.”
Of course, the banks are pleased with the new concession,
as they will be able to get a slice of more lucrative (if
riskier) business. So the banks, these big organisations that
have computers and great expertise in lending to industry,
are now going into the high-cost end of the finance business
where it takes many accounts at high-interest rates to earn
the same net profit as one big industrial account. (Apart
from the greater risk of unsecured lending, it requires
greater and more costly supervision.)
And the finance companies, which have developed some
skills (at considerable cost in terms of bad debts) at handling
the small-appliance financing end of the business, are now
handling the less costly big-account business. This trend
has been evident in their results for some time, as, for
instance, most of the home units built in Sydney in recent
years have been financed by HP companies during construc-
tion and the buyers have bought them on terms from the
same finance houses. In the farm equipment business,
production of many items is financed by HP companies,
which then finance the retailer and then arrange to finance
the sale. AH this, surely, could be better and more cheaply
done by banks. The banks have been pressing for a “more
flexible” interest-rate situation for years, but the Reserve
Bank’s relaxation (first given in limited form last September,
but now spread to “moderate” but unspecified amounts over
unlimited time at up to 11J percent interest) is strictly
for personal borrowers only; it seems related more to the
ad hue need at present for an increase in consumption
expenditure to get the economy moving along again than to
any serious philosophic recognition of the merits of allowing
the banks to act like banks. But then that is the way
things happen here.
In any event, the latest development is very welcome
now that it has finally turned up. It has always been
crazy that the banks refrained from making loans unless
secured by titles to realisable assets. In the modern suburb-
anised world, most of us are pretty regular fellows; we
tend to live our lives in financial ruts. Any bank manager
worth his stipend can tell from examining our transactions
over a period of time what sort of a loan risk we are. He
can certainly do this infinitely more accurately than a hire-
purchase company. And so to do successful business with
us, our trading bank has very little need for titles to our
property. Our income and financial record over a period
of time is as good a security as our property.
These thoughts would sound laughably commonplace to
North American, European, or Japanese bankers. Their
great-grandfathers accepted them, and banking in those
countries has been conducted on such assumptions for about
a century. But for business the dead hand of conservatism
in banking rests as heavily as ever. To be sure, big firms
have relatively little trouble getting the bank finance they
require; for small and medium-sized firms it is usually a
matter of “working capital only” and “well-secured” at
that. It is not done, at least in civilised cricketing coun-
MEN AND MATTERS
IN the days when there were no
restraints on British investment in
Australia, it was quite an event
when a leading British industrialist
actually got around to visiting us. Now
that the U.K. Government is doing its
damnedest to stop the capital outflow
here, the erstwhile trickle of business
tycoons has become a torrent. But two
of the most controversial recent Bri-
tish businessmen visitors here were not
originally British at all; last month’s
visitor Mr. Robert Maxwell, of Per-
gamon Press,' was born a Czech and
only acquired such a British-sounding
name by holding on to one given him
by the Intelligence Service. This
month’s arrival Mr. W. A. de Vigier,
who has stuck by his patronymic, spent
the first 24 years of his life in Switzer-
land before going to Britain to make
his fortune.
Mr. de Vigier arrived in London 30
years ago with £5O (the proceeds of
his last month’s wages from the Mag-
neto Company irl Switzerland, which
had employed him for some years).
He started his industrial life under a
London railway arch and is now the
millionaire head of the company he
founded Acrow, the huge London-
based international building equipment
group which has a large Australian
operation. The idea that brought him
this success was to make an adjustable
steel prop to re-
place the timber
beam and shoring
that had been
used for years in
the building trade.
A family man
(two daughters
and a first-rate
tennis player, de
Vigier established
a reputation as a
controversialist by
refusing to with-
draw a bonus
payment to his British employees last
year despite the Labor Government’s
insistence that it would break the wage
freeze and the law. He insisted that
the bonus was paid to employees for
their role in a big rise in production for
export, which the Government had
exhorted industry to do. And he won.
TWO brothers from Tamworth last
week fired the latest shot in the
battle to woo housewives to par-
ticular brands of products. They distri-
buted three million pre-printed shop-
ping lists to 500,000 N.S.W. middle and
upper income households. These are
reminder lists that not only say “but-
ter” but also suggest a brand.
The brothers are Peter and Kevin
Conlan, two young hucksters who have

wives with free pre-printed books of six

Peter Conlan, a 31-year-old econ-
omics graduate from the University of
N.S.W., is managing director of the
new venture. He was working with
Lever Bros, in Toronto as a brand
manager when Market Maid of Can-
ada, in which Levers acted as a “spon-
sor,” persuaded him to leave Levers
and establish Market Maid’s Australian
organisation.

tion for Radio 2TM, to join his brother.
The dreadful thing about this project
is that it will probably succeed.


tries, for banks to get involved in the financing of capital
projects.
If the economy is to thrive, then such institutional barriers
as these to new and developing firms must be removed.
For it has been a recognised fact in the history of private
enterprise that small firms often contribute greatly to
overall economic efficiency and dynamism. They often
introduce new products and new ways of making old ones,
keeping established firms adaptive. They are likely to be
freer of business bureaucracy, too.
In the present situation, how can a bank lend to a
developmental project whose only real assets are its profit
expectations. Yet this is the sort of activity that should be
attracting a lot of bank attention at present, and it is prob-
ably unfair to blame banks for failing to lend to these
projects at the ruling maximum rate of 7J percent effec-
tively unsecured when they can get a surfeit of perfectly
good safe secured business from their existing customers.
Banks are not expected to be the community’s conscience.
It is not good enough simply to blame the Reserve Bank
about this; there is no doubt that the tanks themselves
are not the most adventurous organisations in the world.
Even if they did have the right to lend money unsecured
to companies the way they are now entitled to do to
individuals, only a few would do so while so many secured
borrowers are around. Security always plays the major part
in a bank’s thinking.
And it is true that most hire-purchase companies (they
have moved so far away from their original functions of
providing hire-purchase funds that they now prefer to be
called finance companies) also require some sort of security
when making loans to companies. But the system they
adopt is much more flexible than that of the banks and
the interest rates they charge are much higher, too.
So what is a bank’s proper function in a modern society?
There seems to be a major area of development in Austra-
lian banking in the industrial field that could be opened
up to banks if the interest rate limit on less secure lending
were raised above 7J percent. In any event, the basic
absurdity of the present situation is overwhelming.
The Battle of* Wyndham
ONE of the last State-owned groups in Western Australia,
the Wyndham Meat Works, has been taken over by
Norwest Development Corporation, which also operates
the Broome meatworks. And this has brought back into
the spotlight Mr. Eric Clementson, the Sydney builder and
managing director (once again) of Project Development
Corporation.
His takeover of the Wyndham Meat Works was con-
tested by the Katherine Meat Works, where the Hooker
group has a big interest. Both companies put in similar
bids, but Norwest subsequently raised theirs. Most
pastoralists, concerned at the pressure tough Mr. Clemenston
can exert, particularly with another meatworks under his
belt, wanted Katherine to win the fight. But as Mr. Ernest
Lee-Steere, president of the W.A. Pastoralists and Graziers
Association says: “The Government had no alternative but
to go for the higher offer.”
Mr. John Tonkin, Leader of the State Opposition, is
also concerned. He calls this an incredible sale, which
would give Norwest Development Corporation the meat-
works for nothing. The sale price is $1,650,000, to be
paid over seven years; this is a $500,000 write-off on the
capital and does not include Perth property owned by
the works, book debts, or some minor assets. Mr. Tonkin
claims that, on the basis of previous operations, repay-
ments can simply be creamed off profits, particularly since
the company plans to cut back on overheads by trimming
staff. Also, he claims, Norwest Development obtained a
$200,000 loan from the State-owned Rural and Industries
Bank, with a Government guarantee to pay up to $10,500
a year.
Katherine’s owners, Northern Meat Exporters, plan to
hit back by draining 10,000 to 12,000 head away from Wynd-
ham this killing season, thus making Clementson’s project
uneconomical.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : February’s keenly awaited
employment figures could only attract comment on
the apparently torpid state of economic activity; season-
ally adjusted, the statistics showed 67,900 registered
unemployed and 40,400 vacancies, bringing the job
gap to 27,500 or 1200 more than January.
Bank liquidity remains noticeably high. Trading
bank deposits in February hit a peak $5489.2m. with
a rise of $ 106.3 m. (decimalisation had meant they
added sl74m. in February, 1966); the month’s advances
dropped back $22.4m. to $2911.6m.
Seasonally adjusted, some 33,000 new motor vehicles
were sold in February, giving the impression of a
reasonably firm market.
Farm income has been estimated to increase by 15
percent to sl2lom. for 1967 . . . Eight months’
wool sales, to February, have brought in $487.4m.,
$20.4m. above last season’s corresponding period.
The Australian producer’s copper price is down $lOO
to $lO5O a ton.
For the markets: Fairly tame trading among in-
dustrials remains the rule on Australian share markets,
which again were unable to post an overall index
gain on the week. The general retreat, however,
still looks mild, with odd firming signs. Metals are
active on a number of interesting reports and oils a
little stronger.
Second-liners are helping to pull London up, as Bank
Rate goes down and a few good company reports
appear . . . The investment tax reduction cheered
Wall Street to advances on quite vigorous dealings.
For companies: The glamorous and giant
flotation of Hamersley Holdings Ltd. obviously illumin-
ated the whole week. CRA’s iron ore concern grandly
expects to earn net profits of the order of s22m. bv
the end of 1970, at which time the cessation of res-
trictions in present loan agreements should permit a
30 percent dividend. Australians can get a 10 percent
direct interest by subscribing for 10 million 50 cent
shares at $2.50 each . . . CRA’s own profit slipped
by six percent to $12,163,433 (earning rate 30.6 per-
cent) in 1966; the 16 percent dividend is held on bonus-
increased capital ... A Barrier associate, New Broken
Hill, had to edge dividend back from 3/1 stg. to 3/-
stg. a share when profit went from $7,945,000 to
$7,427,000.
Vigor distinguished the mining front elsewhere . . .
Another beach sand,? venture hits the lists with Cudgen
R.Z.’s public issue of 2.8 m. 50 cent ordinaries and
433,300 $1 preferences, both at par; peak earnings of
$1,026,332 are predicted for 1967-68 . . . Recently
established Mining Traders Ltd. is offering six million
50 cent shares paid to 20 cents (fetching in $1.2m.); it
is to buy 600,000 Western Titanium shares “at an attrac-
tive price” . . . Mounts Isa and Morgan are push-

Economic prophecy
Poised at the paint box
by CROESUS
AFTER A PROTRACTED period of
fiat business activity the role of economic
prophet is more unenviable than. say.
when a boom is in progress and the'
mantle of Cassandra can be worn v\ ith
confidence. As readers will have noted,
in recent months this column has been
reluctant to go all the way with those
yvho, looking at the revival in retail sales
and production against the background
of export and Government spending
peaks, rising smoke from the housing
w'oods, and more tuneful whispers from
businessmen, industrialists, and stock-
brokers, have not hesitated to paint a
glowing canvas for the economy. It isn't
that my brush is not itching to dab at
the brightest colors in the paint box or
that on some counts I'm a bit more
tempted to do this; rather, that I keep
seeing other things to hold my hand.
For instance, the January unemploy-
ment figures gave the impression that
industry was tending to get increased
production by more intensive use of
the employees already on the books, in
other words by rubbing out some of the
disguised unemployment of last year,
rather than bv signing on m u c h
additional adult labor. They also shorved
a somewhat disappointing rate of
absorption of school-leavers, particularly
young women. On the bright side, the
February figures shoyv a heartening im-
provement in the rate of absorption of
juniors. Against this they confirmed the
rather static level of adult employment
shem n in the previous month.
For one reason or another the
Ministry of Labor refuses to publish
seasonally corrected figures for unem-
ployment (presumably it makes them
for its emu use), so we have to rely on
unofficial ones. Whereas the official
unadjusted February figures shoyy a drop
of 13,700 (from 89,000 to 76,300) on
the January level, seasonal correction
turns this into a slight rise, from 66,400
to 67,000, yvhich is the highest February
figure for years on a seasonally col-
lected basis. Such correction also trans-
forms the unadjusted figures for job
vacancies. A drop from 49,900 in Janu-
ary to 42,600 in February job vacancies
becomes a small rise from 40,000 to
40,500. This means that last month,’on
an adjusted basis, the unemployment
gap widened by 2100 as against a nar-
rowing of 5400 on the unadjusted figure.
On these figures the best we can
say is that the unemployment situation
changed marginally last month. Against
a slight drop in numbers receiving un-
employment benefit and big improve-
ment in the absorption of school-
leavers has to be yyeighed what appears
to be a slight deterioration in the
situation for adults. With unemploy-
ment over the whole country averag-
ing only 1.6 percent last month this
is nothing to cry about, but it is
obviously not indicative of a big pend-
ing upsurge in the demand for labor
either.
It ha s to be remembered, of course,
that even the best of entrepreneurs'
intentions tend to run foul of summer
elements in the first two months in the
year and conceivably the demand for
labor is going to work up to a higher
pitch in the coming months. Coupled
with more recent evidence of rising
retail sales and industrial production,
the national income and spending
accounts for last December quarter
point in that direction, even if the
Ministry of Labor's figures for February
do not. At least on the face of it, their
indication that national expenditure
(especially on personal consumption)
moved up more smartly in the quarter,
and that manufacturing, retail, and
wholesale stocks all declined contra-
scasonally, provides a promising
prelude for a more buoyant industrial
and commercial scene and also the
labor market.
BHF’s supplementary report gives an
unequivocal pointer to the extent this
rise in national expenditure is likely
to benefit industrial orders. The revival
in domestic steel demand noted by Sir
Colin Syme at the annual meeting late-
last year has blossomed to the .extent
that since September steel orders have
risen 60 percent on the level of the
half-year to May last year. When BHF
begins to talk of steel exports being
likely to fall it usually means not so
much that the world market has become
mere competitive (even if one is told
that), but that the home market,
where much higher profit margins
pertain, is warming up.
Anyway, the lift in BHF's own
order book is so big that it doesn t
require much stretch of the imagina-
tion to see an improved outlook for
fixed private investment, which has
been the most laggard of all the gen-
erators of economic activity for a year
or more. Such an improvement has yet
to show up in the national accounts,
though the December quarter's figures
show that at least one of the com-
ponents of fixed private investment, that
is in dwellings, has pulled up very
well. Because it lagged early in the
year, for the yy hole of 1966 it was only
1 percent above the previous year but
in the December quarter it was running
7.3 percent above the like quarter in
1965. On the other hand, after a prom-
ising start other building and construc-
tion tapered off toward the end of the
year. Although it managed a 3 per-

STETSON CENTENNIAL
You’ll need more than a hat to advance to the executive suite
but never underestimate the power of a Stetson to mark you as
a man who’s very much ‘on target!’ Especially a Stetson
fashioned in the distinctive ‘Ascot’ pattern (illustrated) —one of
the many new, confident patterned Stetsons worn by men on
the move the world over. At all leading men’s wear stores.
"o
STETSON BORN IN AMERICA WORN AROUND THE WORLD,
cent increase over the full year, its
level in the December quarter was
about 9 percent down on December,
1965.
As for private capital expenditure in
the rest of the private sector, this
picked up a bit to sslsm. in the latest
December quarter but was still well
below the $54 lm. for the same quarter
in 1965 (the best-ever quarterly total for
this). The super-optimists can’t take
much heart from that. They can,
though, take some from the sustained
high rate of fixed gross capital expendi-
ture in the public sector. At $535m. the
latter easily beat the ssl3m. in the
December quarter a year earlier and,
excepting the last two June quarters
(always bumper ones for public invest-
ment), was a quarterly record.
However, looking at national fixed
capital expenditure as a whole there
is less cause for optimism because, even
with the public sector pulling the total’s
chestnuts out of the fire last calender
year, the increase was only 3 percent,
whereas for 1965 it was 10 percent.
Worse still, the overall level of national
fixed investment in the December
quarter of 1966 was virtually un-
changed from the like quarter in 1965.
A rise of 4 percent in the public ele-
ment (roughly a third of the total)
failed to compensate for a drop of
about 3 percent in the private sector.
This hardly fits the prescription for an
economy scaling new heights of activity
or more rapid rates of genuine (as dis-
tinct merely from consumption)
growth.
A few weeks ago it was suggested
here that, given a strong revival in
private investment by the time of the
Loan Council meeting in June, it might
be necessary to ease back the rate of
increase in public sector fixed invest-
ment to stop an overflow. If that
strong revival and a big change in in-
vestment expectations has been taking
place it is certainly not reflected in
the disappointing December quarter’s
figures for private investment. As for
the current March quarter, March is
usually the dullest one of the year for
fixed investment, so when the figures
for it this year come along in May
they may not be all that much help
to the authorities.
At this stage one wouldn’t expect
any sudden step-up in fixed investment
in manufacturing industry and much
could depend on whether the current
efforts being made by all and sundry
in the housing finance world to whip
up house and flat building are success-
ful. Further, on the extent to which
office and other non-dwelling construc-
tion manages to hold up rather against
the odds. No, I’m not dabbing in for
the blues and the golds just yet awhile.


THE BROKEN HILL PROPRIETARY CO. LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Supplementary
Report
EXCERPTS FROM DIRECTORS'
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT,
FEBRUARY, 1967
PRODUCTION
Near capacity levels of output have
been obtained in the Company’s main
plants and production records have
been set in many departments at New-
castle, Port Kembla, and Whyalla. For
the six months ended 30th November,
1966, steel ingot production was 3.04
million tons, and pig iron output 2.46
million tons. The steel ingot figure rep-
resents a 7.9% increase on the corres-
ponding period for the previous year,
with pig iron showing an increase of
11.8%.
DEMAND
It was noted at the Annual General
Meeting that there was evidence of a
recovery in Australian demand for steel
after the decline in early 1966 and it is
pleasing to report that this upward
trend continued throughout the period
under review, when the tonnages of
orders received per week from other
than associated companies increased by
approximately 60% above the low rate
for the six months ended May, 1966.
A continuation of the upward trend
in local orders in 1967 is expected as
the major steel users, especially primary
industry, return to more normal levels
of consumption.
The introduction of universal sections
on the structural mill at Whyalla is
proceeding satisfactorily and a full
range of sizes will be available from
the middle of the year.
Apart from structural sections, the
Australian and New Zealand markets
should provide sufficient demand to
allow capacity outputs for the re-
mainder of 1967 in all major product
categories.
Current export negotiations are
largely confined to tonnages of semi-
finished products surplus to our needs.
There has been some improvement re-
cently in export prices offering in cer-
tain areas for a few categories of iron
and steel products.
Longer term, however, the forecasts
continue to point to world capacity
remaining well in excess of demand
and in these circumstances export prices
are likely to remain generally un-
attractive.
DEVELOPMENT AND
CONSTRUCTION
The development and construction
program at the principal works con-
tinue at a high level and a number of
important projects were commissioned
during the period.
At Newcastle, installation of the 50
ton 8.0.5. furnace is well advanced and
foundation work for the continuous
casting machine is in progress. Site
preparation for the new merchant mill
was completed.
No. 4 Coke Ovens Battery with
associated coal cleaning and by-product
plant were commissioned on 16ih
November, 1966, at Port Kembla. A
new general works machine shop also
commenced operations. Work is pro-
ceeding on No. 2 temper mill which
will be completed during the first
quarter of 1967 as an adjunct to the
tinplate plant.
At Whyalla the universal beam mill
was commissioned on 26th September.
Construction work on both the coke
ovens and the pellet plant is progress-
ing. The duplication of the tonnage
oxygen plant is practically completed
in readiness for increased steel produc-
tion.
Plant additions at Kwinana include
a No. 3 luffing crane on the products
jetty and modifications to the re-heating
furnace. Construction work continued
on the new plant being installed under
the Stage 1 steel plant programme.
RAW MATERIALS
AND EXPLORATION
Exploration for petroleum on tene-
ments held by our wholly owned sub-
sidiary, Haematite Explorations Pty.
Ltd., in the Gippsland, Bass and Otway
Basins, has been actively continued by
Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd.
Seismic survey work has been carried
out at various locations including the
Otway Basin. Exploratory drilling has
been directed towards the assessment
of the Marlin field and during the
period Marlin B 1 and Marlin Cl were
completed as step-out wells.
Marlin B 1 well was drilled to 10,007
feet. Extreme difficulties were en-
countered during drilling of this well

and although it confirmed the existence
of a large gas field it failed to achieve
an oil production flow during testing
operations. It is thought this was prin-
cipally due to the geological conditions
encountered at the oil horizon level.
The Marlin Cl well was completed at
5845 feet in mid-January. A series of
production tests was completed in the
interval between 5,108 ft. and 5,150 ft.
which involved flows of gas, oil, and
water at various rates.
Whilst the tests confirm the presence
of a substantial gas reserve in the Mar-
lin field, the results obtained from the
three wells in this field were not uni-
form as far as the data on the oil zone
is concerned.
The data obtained as a result of these
testing operations is now being pro-
cessed for further assessment of the
possible oil potential of the field.
These studies are highly technical
and are subject to continual revision
whenever additional information be-
comes available. With the knowledge
presently available it would not be
justifiable to venture any assessment of
reserves or producibility.
It should be appreciated that in the
case of land based operations it is pos-
sible, within the same cost and time
limits to drill many more step-out wells,
and thereby obtain a much more com-
plete picture of the characteristics of a
field, than is possible where offshore
operation is involved. Decisions requir-
ing major investments offshore may
therefore need to be taken on the basis
that the reserves and producibility may
not be known with certainty until pro-
duction operations actually commence.
After lengthy negotiations agreement
has been reached with the Government
of Victoria regarding the production
licences for the Barracouta and Marlin
fields, and as at i'. • time of writing,
this report we are at an advanced stage
in completing arrangements with the
Gas & Fuel Corporation for the sale
of natural gas. Construction of the
marine servicing facilities at Port
Welshpool has now commenced and
offshore developments will be proceeded
with immediately an agreement has
been signed with the Corporation.
The Company has a 50% working
interest, in the Barracouta field as a
result of its election of some twelve
months ago, and will be responsible for
finding 50% of the capital required for
the development of the field. Separate
arrangements to raise this money have
been concluded.
As reported previously, if the
Company elects a 50% working in-
terest in the Marlin field we have cer-
tain options to obtain finance on reason-
able terms, without in any way affect-
ing the Company’s equity in the ven-
ture.
Mention was made at the Annual
General Meeting of the proposal for
the Company to join with American
Metal Climax Inc. and Colonial Sugar
Refining Co. Ltd. in the development of
the iron ore deposits at Mt. Newman
in Western Australia. Considerable pro-
gress has since been made in the com-
plex negotiations involved and all neces-
sary decisions have now been made by
the participants to enable this very large
project to proceed. The Company,
through Dampier Mining Co. Ltd., will
have a 30% interest in the venture
and will participate in export sales
as well as take ore for use in our own
blast furnaces. Contracts have been
negotiated for the sale of 100 million
tons of ore to Japan with shipments
commencing during 1969.
The company has been invited by the
two original parties in Mt. Newman to
manage the project for a period of
five years which will cover the main
construction phase and mining opera-
tions up to production level of at least
7.5 million tons per annum. For this
purpose we formed a wholly owned sub-
sidiary, Mount Newman Mining Co.
Pty. Ltd., the operational office of
which will be located in Perth.
SHIP BUILDING
The second of four bulk carriers,
“Bogong” (54,000 tons d.w.), was
launched in August and handed over
to Bulkships Ltd. last month.
The keel of a third large bulk car-
rier was laid last August, but recent pro-
gress has slowed down with labor being
transferred to the offshore drilling rig
for Ocean Drilling and Exploration Co.
Ltd. This is the first structure of its
type built in Australia, and its con-
struction will present some problems
which are not normally encountered in
ship-building operations.
Orders for the construction of two
container/specialised motor ships have
been obtained, and it is hoped that we
will be successful in securing the order
for a 46,000 - ton bauxite carrier.
Activities should therefore be main-
tained at a high level and prospects of
extending a firm order book well into
1969 appear to be promising.
SUBSIDIARY
COMPANIES
Commonwealth Steel Co. Ltd. is still
experiencing difficulties and results are
disappointing. Production improved on
the previous six months but is still
down when compared with the level
of the same period in the previous year.
Sales of railway wheels, tyres, axles, and
grinding media are somewhat higher,
but this is mainly from marginal export
sales where there is little profit.
Stainless steel production showed a
substantial increase.
Demand for products of the Austra-
lian Wire Industries Pty. Ltd. group
of companies has been influenced by a
considerable improvement in seasonal
conditions and a slight upturn in build-
ing activity.
The second ferro manganese furnace
of Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Co.
Pty. Ltd. was commissioned in October,
1966, and two-furnace operation is
now proceeding at a satisfactory level.
The Titan Manufacturing Co. Pty.
Ltd. reports substantially increased
sales and profits throughout all of its
works due to rising demand, increased
exports, and better plant efficiencies.
RESEARCH
At the Annual General Meeting,
shareholders were informed that sketch
plans for the new research centre close
to Monash University in Melbourne
have been prepared and detailed design
of the laboratories is now proceeding.
It is anticipated that construction will
commence by mid-1967 and that the
laboratories will be completed by Nov-
ember, 1968.
SHIPPING
With the large bulk carriers, “Darl-
ing River” and “Bogong,” entering the
coastal iron ore trade, a number of
the smaller ships have become surplus
to the coastal trade.
Accordingly, the oldest vessel in the
Company’s fleet, the “Iron Baron,” has
been sold to foreign owners and four
of the product carriers have been en-
gaged in carrying steel export cargoes
to countries to our north. Altogether
since December, 1965, Company vessels
have visited sixteen ports in six over-
seas countries.

"Less Worse" for Appliances

petition is still very tough, margins
are tight and oveicapacity a loun s.
But at last things seem to be getting
“less worse”; at last the industry seems
to have begun to bounce off the bottom.
Recovery is going to be slow and
difficult, but it is no longer reasonable
to write’ the industry off as an invest-
ment Even if it takes a while for
share prices to come good. at least
the dividend yields while waiting
should make 1, worth most investors'
while. The better look to the industry
comes not only from the indications
of increasing consumer demand (helper
along by dwelling construction figures
and the latest news of unsecured bank
loans at moderate interest rates) but
also from the rationalising of produe-
tion within the industry and the shake-
outs that have occurred within some
of the leading companies
Both these factors played a part m
. , . . > 101
last week s interim report from Uec-
tronic industries, which is far better
than the market has given it credit
f or There is no doubt that the com-
panv has a lot of problems still to be
solved. Yet the fact that Electronic
can afford even to pay a 31 percent in-
terim dividend is evidence enough that
things are getting better all the time.
For this time last year the company was
doing very badly indeed possible
oven trading at a loss, as second-half
P™f.ts dumped after a reasonably soltd
la , .
fhe fim half of the culTent yea r, the
company has only to make another
$150,009 in the second half to cover
the 7 percent dividend and the
prospects are that it will do much
better than that, even though the
second half is likely (as usual) to
bring in less than the first half. Direc-
tors have indicated that trading con-
ditions since December continue to be
better than those for the same period
of last year.
Apart from the heartening news of
recovery from this state, Electronic's
steady net profit for the first half of
the current year was quite an achieve-
ment in the circumstances of a doubled
tax provision (now up to about 40
percent of pre-tax profit) as past tax
iosses have now been almost completely
absorbed. Increasing turnover (up to
12 percent) was only one reason for
Electronic’s 32 percent pre-tax profit
rise in the 6 months to December; the
main one appears to be increased
efficiency within the group, along with
some rationalised production arrange-
ments (the company no longer makes
washing machines, for example) and a
significant improvement in the retail
side of its operations.
It will probably take three years or
so to get Electronic right out of the
soup and it will be some time before
Electronic can lift its dividend above
the present rate and a long time
indeed before it can look toward a
restoration of the old 12£ percent rate.
In the meantime, an 11.1 percent
dividend yield seems a pleasant way
of waiting for the market to turn
up.
The Philips takeover of Pye has
some implications for Electronic, as it
gives Philips a 48 percent holding of
the A voting shares in the company
(but only a 7 percent holding
altogether). And if the Philips move
indicates further rationalising of the
local appliance industry, it should be
to everyone’s advantage so long as
the benefits do not all go Philips' way.
Interestingly enough, Philips supplies
Electronic with TV picture tubes. In
any event, the B shares get equal vot-
ing rights if a 5 percent dividend is not
paid for two years, and this could
always be a tactic up the board’s sleeve.
Philips have no representative on
Electronic’s board. But on the other
hand, failure to pay a 5 percent divi-
dend would depress the shares to a
cheap level for acquisition (and Philips
have some skill in acquiring large
shareholdings without anyone, includ-
ing their financial advisers, being aware
of" it).
THE annual accounts for 1966 from
General Industries pose some
problems to investors. Following
a striking similar pattern to last year,
they show that the company’s trad-
ing result was even worse than the 2(J
percent fall in net profit suggested.
The Chartist says:
THE share price movements of PAPUAN APINAIPI PEI ROLEUM since 1961
are somewhat dramatic on the chart, and they illustrate an almost classic-
example of a “bearish” top formation up to the middle of 1964, which
turned into a strong downward trend. Prices tumbled to the major objective at
the base level of 10c. Consolidation has taken plate above this point with a rally
to 22c about the middle of last year. The major downtrend for this stock was
recently broken with the rise to 21c on high turnover, and a complete reversal of
trend is nov\' likely. Targets of 28c, 38c, 48c, and 68c for the longer term are a
distinct possibility. However, resistance would be fairly strong above the 40c level
from the area of trading which took place from 1961-1964, prior to the com-
mencement of the downtrend. The overall chart pattern compares favorably with
the Associated Group for a promising upward movement. Last sale price on

and on the other hand they reveal that
ihe balance sheet was in good shape
and that the company’s future dividend
commitment is not as high as had
been expected.
The accounts confirm the suggestion
made here last April that profit mar-
gins for the group appeared to be still
in a downtrend. The latest trading
profit had fallen $75,000 to $959,151
despite an $BO,OOO reduction in borrow-
ing costs, so in trading terms the com-
pany was $155,000 worse off. And the
$25,000 dividend* from Iplex Plastic In-
dustries that was included in net profit
appears to have been a book entry
against assets, as the investment in
Iplex now appears at only $175,000
rather than $200,000 in the balance
sheet. The fall in interest charges
was due mainly to the company’s
redemption and cancelling of 417,000
of the 1.1 million $2 convertible notes
(thereby reducing the impact of
next August’s conversion on an already
overcapitalised company).
The accounts show- that the com-
pany’s latest profit would have been
large enough (despite the 20 percent
fall) to have covered the present 6
percent dividend even had normal
tax been paid and had the outstanding
convertible notes been converted. As
it was, tax had taken only about 18
percent of pre-tax profit (compared
with only 3 percent in the previous
year), and the likely rise in tax this
year should not, in itself, endanger
the dividend.
But the U.K. squeeze has come at a
dreadful time for General Industries,
as its big and expensive expansion there
through its Grimwood subsidiary barely
had the chance to get off the ground
before Mr. Wilson’s measures. Although
it is reported to be profitable, it has
clearly not contributed as much as ex-
pected and probably will not do so fpr
quite some time. General Industries
is clearly not out of the w'oods yet, but
prices around $1.20 for the $2 shares
seem to take care of most problems.
ANOTHER depressed stock that has
been receiving some attention
here is Concrete Industries, whose
latest success wdth claims against the
American Navy over the North West
Cape project is important not only
because of the $1.6 million or so that
the latest one probably totals but also
because of its implications for other
claims. There seems little chance, for
example, that the Navy would proceed
against Concrete Industries for liqui-
dated damages in the climate of the
latest decisions, so it seems that there
is no longer the danger of an unspeci-
fied claim by the Americans over the
long delays to the project.
In any event, it appears certain that
Concrete Industry’s $6 million pro-
vision against loss on the project will
not now be needed, even though tin-
company will no doubt still suffer some
losses - as, indeed, it deserves to.
And for those with a speculative head,
prospects of a takeover of the com-
pany are much brighter than in tin-
days when the position of the claims
was so uncertain.
There are 61 cents of assets at book
value in the company against a current
share price around 40 cents; its shares
are widely spread with a few large
holders, and its directors now include
a majority of men who are more
aware of the facts of business life and
less committed to the company as such
in past days. A takeover offer is In
no means impossible if the share price
keeps down around current levels.
MANY investors have yet to realise
that K. G. Luke Group Indus-
tries Ltd. will benefit from the
introduction of natural gas. Apart from
its traditional activities as a supplier
of commercial and industrial kitchen
equipment, a lot of which goes to
defence establishments, the company is
also a major manufacturer of gas cocks
and fittings. These fittings go to the
various gas appliance manufacturers
and gas authorities.
In the longer term, there could be
further gains from a growth in demand
for fittings if natural gas gives any
extra impetus to the currently expand-
ing demand for LPG appliances. For

K. G. Luke the outlook is good. There
is even a remote possibility that it
could get some benefit from its activity
as a producer of component pa ts for
the refrigeration and air-conditioning
industries (this thought may be a little
far fetched, but it is not completely
beyond the bounds of probability). In
refrigeration, especially, natural gas has
been cited as a cheap power source
(usually on an industrial scale) in more
than one circle.
Moreover, all these come on top of
the general recovery which is expected
from the group this year. Earning rate
toppled from 22.4 to 13.5 percent in
1965-66 because of various factors, but
the benefits of the $1 million spent on
plant and building extensions over the
past two years is now' starting to pay
off. Profits were up ten percent in the
December half and the trend was
expected to continue for the rest of
the year.
Eactors which caused the 1965-66
dip are no longer important. One was
the disruption caused by the expansion l
program, another was copper price
fluctuations, and a third was, needless
to say, the drought. All these problems
have since been largely overcome. At
$1.50 (or 42 cents below last year’s
peak) the shares yield an acceptable
percent from the ten percent divi-
dend which, incidentally, has been paid
every year since 1960, despite several
large fluctuations in earning rates.
ANOTHER company that should
do well out' of the natural gas
business is Email, particularly now
that it has signed a manufacturing and
distribution agreement with the Ameri-
can Meter Company, one of the leaders
in natural and town gas reticulation
and distribution in the L.S. But in
addition to metering and control appa-
ratus that wfill now be available, the
company should also receive some
boost to sales of its traditional gas
appliances when natural gas comes in.
Email seems at last to have tidied
itself up and the latest doubling of
profit is probably due more to internal
improvements (such as rationalising
all its fan operations into one division,
for example) than to the nevertheless
pleasing increase in business and im-
provement of conditions in some soft
spots.
BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Protector Safety and Growth
Bl YING shares in family com-
panies can be a risky business—
and the Botch family (they have
not sold any shares) still own about
half the share capital of Protector
Safety Industries Ltd., the strikingly
successful Sydney-based maker of in-
dustrial safety equipment that Herman
Botch started 27 years ago and which
has been listed for the past six of them.
It can also be a most rewarding
one. And at current prices below $2,
Protector shares have the double
attraction of safety (by nature as well
as by name) and prospects of signi-
ficant growth.
Nevertheless, although it seems to
have overdone it, the market was quite
light to show some disappointment with
last year’s result, which brought a sud-
den slowdown in rate of profit rise,
along with a definite fall in earnings on
funds employed in the business (dis-
turbing in view of the 25 percent in-
crease in capital that has since taken
place, even though it poses no threat
at all to the 12 percent dividend that
was covered 5£ times by last year’s
earnings).
The prospects are that earning rate
may be in for only a slight rise and
could even fall a little again this year
on higher capital, although profits were
up in the first six months. But with
the company’s shares priced at only
seven times last year’s earnings per
share', the market has clearly taken this
into account —and then some. (Directors
reported at the half-way mark that
local and export sales are at record
levels, and profit was higher than in
the 1965 December half).
The latest balance sheet also had
one or two features about it worth
examining. Debtors and stock both
jumped by almost 50 percent (although
net profit only rose by little better
than 2 percent). These the company
paid for in part by its $230,000 re-
tained profits but more by big rises
in bank overdraft, short-term unsecured
loans, bills payable (a new item), and
trade creditors, which combined to pro-
vide the bulk of the $450,000 (or two-
thirds) rise in current liabilities. Clearly
the big rise in business last year (and
it appears that extra business was the
major factor in the rise in debtors
and stock) did not bring comparable
profit rewards; it was not the sort of
growth that the stockmarket has much
liking for. But there are indications
that this rapid growth will bring in-
creasing returns in the long run.
Another factor in the stock rise is
that the company is selling increasing
amounts of its products overseas, so
involving the company in larger stock-
carrying periods as deliveries take
longer. In addition, $70,000 of the
company’s long-term secured loans
and mortgages fall due this financial
year.
So, on the face of it, the company
certainly needed the $142,000 proceeds
of last October’s l-for-4 share issue
just to get its financing house in order,
apart from the requirements of expan-
sion; even then its current ratio would
have remained well below the ideal
level of two to one. But the realities
are different. The company reallv is
using the new capital for further
expansion (particularly in the pro-
tected N.Z. market, where Protector
plans to build a new factory on some
already purchased land). The long-
term secured loans and mortgages are
being renewed (they only total less
than half the cost price of the com-
pany's freeholds), and at balance date
the company had about $140,000 cash
or deposits available to it.
If the company's needs for expan-
sion in its overseas subsidiaries grow
too pressing, there is always the pos-
sibility that it could sell off part in-
terests in them to the locals (particu-
larly N.Z. and South Africa, which
are keen on local participation and
where there have already been some
inquiries on that score), and use the
funds gained to finance their growth.
But at present the board prefers to run
these operations as wholly owned Aus-
tralian shows in order to get the con-
siderable taxation benefits that come
as an export incentive. These foreign
operations may not be the end of
Protector’s overseas expansion; the
North American market is understood
to appeal to the. company’s manage-
ment, which sees some opportunities
there.
Exports are an important part of the
company’s operations; last year “sub-
stantial expenditure was incurred on
export promotion and this is expected
to be of continuing benefit,” and this
“affected” the tax provision, which was
only 25 percent of pre-tax profit last
year instead of the regular percent.
The company supplies more than 50
countries on all continents, a measure
of its international standards.
The fields for which Protector Safety
caters are definitely expansive. Both
management and trade unions have
grown more safety conscious, as evi-
denced by the fall in industrial accident
fatalities from 300 to 216 in N.S.W. in
the four years to 1964-65, but there
were still 415 lives lost throughout Aus-
tralia in industry in 1964-65. Protector
has carved a major slice of the Austra-
lian protective equipment market. The
products made under licence are hardly
worth mentioning; almost all the range
is made to the company’s owm designs,
and much is spent on research, design,
craftsmanship, and quality control. Pro-
ducts sold overseas are modified for
the local requirements.
The greatest profit improvement
seems to date from the move to new
factory premises in Sydney and Auck-
land. In 1962, new quarters were pur-

The Carrier nameplate appears on air
conditioners of every shape and size. It's your
guarantee of quality. It signifies an excellent
product, backed by the world-wide reputation
of the Carrier Organisation. No other
manufacturer of air conditioning equipment
can match the range, service or years of
experience of Carrier. This is why more people
select Carrier than any other make of

chased in Buckingham Street, Sydney,
and the firm moved production from
Chippendale to the city.
Trading operations in South Africa
began in July, 1964, and manufacturing
shortly after. The company opened
up in Britain in May, 1965, but pro-
gress there, while satisfactory, is not
so dynamic as in South Africa. Agents
were appointed in New Zealand and
South Africa in the ’sos, and the Auck-
land factory started up in September,
1959. New Zealand activities have
been hampered by import restrictions
on components. The South African
factory is in Johannesburg, and there
are branches in Cape Town and Dur-
ban. In Australia, branches are located
in Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and
Newcastle, all of which have moved
or arranged to move to larger premises
within the past couple of years.
Group turnover trebled in the six
years to listing in 1961, and has more
than trebled (on a higher base, of
course) in the subsequent five years. In
its short public history, capital has in-
creased from $400,000 to $670,000 by
two par issues (both one-for-four), a
premium placement (to take over a
major Victorian distributor, Industrial
Protective Co. Pty., in December,
1965), and issues to employees. The
latest capital move was in October,
1966, the second one-for-four par issue,
adding $142,000 to liquid resources as
shown in the last accounts.
The company has a lot of expand-
ing to do yet, so there seems every pros-
pect that the dividend policy may be
fairly modest because of the need to
finance the expansion mainly from
ploughback. It seems that future
benefits for some time to come may be
mainly in the large, bonus element in
the share issues for expansion that the
company makes at par.
Those who hope for a bonus issue
may be disappointed; there are few
capital reserves in the company and,
anyway, there seems scope for con-
siderable dividend increases before the
question of a bonus should come up.
But there are real rewards ahead in this
stock for those investors keen on growth.
For this is a company whose turnover,
profits, and dividends are rising and
should continue to do so, which is
efficient enough to compete on world
markets, is supplying a rapidly increas-
ing home demand, and whose shares
are obtainable at a cost of only seven
times last year’s earnings. All this more
than offsets the small dividend yield of
only 3.1 percent and the possibility of a
slightly lower earning rate again this
year.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
“There is nothing in the bag,” exclaimed Western Mining
Corporation’s chairman after London buying skyrocketed the
shares a hectic 54 cents on Friday; over the whole week
the price put on a most impressive 64 cents to finish at $7.50.
Plenty of other news kept the mining markets active. Coppers
are still viewed doubtfully, so Mount Morgan shed another 10
cents to reach $2.80, while Mount Isa, at $3.80, lost 3 cents,
BHP managed only a 2 cent advance following the report;
Bank of N.S.W. dropped 4 cents to $5.12. A notable fall
was Berlei’s 22 cents to $2.28. Electronic B added 15 cents.

Flour, Mixed with Holdens
By PELIAS in Melbourne
FLOUR and Holdens are doing-
much better. So there are strong
recovery prospects for Noske
Industries Ltd., the Melbourne-based
company that combines Hour-milling
with a Holden dealership (among other
things).
The shares are selling for a mere
cent above par; this reflects the poor
1965-66 year, but fails to take any
account of the substantial improvement
staged so far in the current term. For
an idea of the potential capital gains
to be made on present prices, one only
has to look back to January, 1966,
when the shares were fetching around
and above 70 cents. The price range
was between $l.OB and 72 cents in
1965. In both its major activities the
group has enjoyed a substantial
recovery over the past few months and
the market should not continue to un-
dervalue the shares for very much
longer.
Last year’s substantial profit drop
cut earning rate savagely from 21.7 to
11.2 percent and brought a dividend
reduction from the well-established 11
percent to eight percent. As a result,
the shares fell to a low of 44 cents,
and had only risen to 46 cents earlier
this month when the interim report was
released announcing 25 percent higher
profits for the December half and
promising a further improvement in
the current six months. The shares
jumped to 55 cents, but have since
drifted to 51. The dividend yield from
this price is an attractive 7.8 percent.
It is made more so by the fact that
directors may well lift, if not restore,
the payout when final 1966-67 results
are announced.
Last year’s setback was due mainly
to the downturn in the motor industry
and was helped by a drop in flour
exports. The Holden-dealing subsidiary,
Queen’s Bridge Motors, was forced to
write down used-car stocks on top of
dealing with stiff competition, and suf-
fered a loss. The engineering division
also contributed, with a substantial
write-down of time-expired stocks.
In common with all Holden dealers,
Queen’s Bridge Motors has reversed its
position in the current year. It moved
back on to profits during the December
half and earnings will presumably get
an added boost over the full year from
a reduced tax bill, made possible by the
1965-66 loss. The engineering sub-
sidiary earned slightly lower profits, but
the higher orders at December 31
should ensure a lift in the final half—
and there will be no large write-offs to
contend with.
Flour-milling and stock-feed activi-
ties have both gained ground. The flour-
milling activities especially should do a
lot for the group result this year fol-
lowing the 200,000-ton purchase by
Ceylon from Australian mills and the
Commonwealth Government’s decision
to give away substantial quantities to
India and Indonesia under its external
aid program.
Although the stock-feed division did
not suffer a setback during 1965-66,
it, too, will add handsomely to group
profits in the current year. Output rose
substantially in the December six
months; in the current half, there will
be added benefits from the operations
of the new plant at Horsham. This
did not start operating until December,
so its full effect will be felt for the first
time in the current half. According to
a company spokesman, local acceptance
of the new plant’s products has been
good, with sales increasing every week.
It seems that Noske’s profits in the
current half will improve at a faster

rate than the 25 percent scored in
the December period. Assuming an
average 30 percent improvement for
the full year, earning rate would rise
to around 15 percent. However, if
the majority of last year’s write-offs
were made at the end of the year and
the 25 percent improvement in the
latest half was from trading operations
only, then the absence of write-offs at
the end of the current half will pro-
vide a substantial profit boost in addi-
tion to the increased returns from trad-
ing. This could give the group an
average annual improvement of well
over 30 percent. In any event, the
dividend looks due for a rise. Asset
backing for each of the 50 cent shares
is close on three times current market
prices.
ONE advantage in being both a civil
engineer and a master builder is
that if one side of the business
slows down (how long can the office-
building boom continue?) the other side
can often take up the slack (there have
never been so many developmental pro-
jects). Some building companies that
followed this philosophy got their fin-
gers burned a few years ago, when they
took on work they knew nothing about
at a time of severe competition in the
industry. But order has now been re-
stored, as most of them have retired to
their own fields of endeavor. One of
the few never to have been troubled by
these problems was John Holland
Holdings Ltd., the Melbourne-based
company that has never burdened
shareholders with news of losses on any
of its jobs.
Its shares have lost a little market
limelight over the past few months, a
natural reaction to last September’s
one-for-five bonus issue. But there seems
little doubt that 1966-67 will be a
record year. John Holland’s latest
success has been the completion of civil
engineering works for ICIANZ, near
the Queensland salt project, well ahead
of time. Under the terms of the con-
tract, the group will receive a bonus
payment for finishing the job early; it
is believed to be about $30,000.
Add this to the higher profits re-
ported for the first half of the current
year (the trend was expected to con-
tinue right through until June 30) and
it is clear that 1966-67 profits will go
well over the $500,000 mark. Earning
rate last year was 36.8 percent. On
present indications, the rate should be
30 percent or more this year, despite
the bonus issue. This will maintain
wide cover for the expected 12? per-
cent dividend.
At $1.22 the shares are yielding 5.1
percent from dividends, so income will
be fair while shareholders are await-
ing further capital appreciation and
company-generated benefits. At the
present rate of growth, finances could
afford another bonus issue in 1967-68,
particularly if John Holland continues
to hold its dividend down so far below
its earnings.

MINING
Longreach at Duchess
BY October last year Longreach Oil
had completed sixteen diamond-
drill holes on its mineral pros-
pects near Duchess-, about 80 miles
south of Mount Isa. Since then further
work has been carried out, particularly
extensive costeaning (i.e., deep surface
trenching) by bulldozer. Considering
that drilling commenced some ten
months ago, the information which the
company has given, to date, concerning
these leases is remarkably meagre, the
more so w'hen compared with the pro-
gress reports of drilling carried out at
Kambalda by Western Mining Corpor-
ation Ltd., which gave the length of
the mineralised zones encountered by
each drill, the grade of ore, and the size
of the drilling grid pattern. Certainly
Longreach has had to be fairly cautious
while it is dealing with approaches
made to it by several major overseas
groups with a view to partnership in
the areas, but it is difficult to see how
shareholders would not be better off
having full know ledge of drilling results.
Of the three copper-bearing areas,
most information to date has concerned
the “St. Mungo No. 4” mine, where
drilling has revealed copper mineralis-
ati m to a depth of 733 vertical feet
and of some 60ft. in horizontal width.
This mineralisation has a surface length
of some 350 ft. indicated by the exten-
sive surface trenching carried out. The
depth of the ore body was obtained
by drilling, and intersections of ore
w'ere obtained at 250 ft., 500 ft., and
700 ft. below' the surface. One drill core
contained two zones, each of more than
13ft. and of an average overall grade
of 10 percent copper. While this grade
is very encouraging (Peko-Wallsend
mines ore grades of slightly less than
4 percent copper), it is apparently the
highest giade levealed to date by the
company, and is probably too high a
figure to use in any estimate of hke4y
profitability from development of the
mine.
A P iece of ground 60ft. wide, 350 ft.
and 700 ft. deep would contain
about one million tons of ore. This is
necessarily a fairly rough estimate, but
using this as a base, together with an
overall recovered grade of 3 percent
copper, total revenue from the sale of
concentrates containing 30,000 tons of
copper could be to the order of
s24m. Costs of extraction, treat-
ment, transport, and realisation could
f* e as high as $ll P er to n of ore, a
total of sllm., leaving a gross mining
profit of sl3m. No information is yet
available on which to estimate the
size of plant to mine and treat the ore
tody, but a very modest estimate
w’ould stait at s2m., which w'ould pro-
v^e a basis foi depieciation. This
would leave P re ' tax P roht of s ll
gwing sBm. after tax (20 percent of
P roti ts from mining copper is exempt
from ,ax under sectlon 23A of th^
tax legislation).
Longreach Oil owns 67. j percent of
Longreach Minerals, so the profit
attributable to Longreach Oil would
be $5.3m. Should a half-interest be
taken up in the venture by an organ-
isation such as Pechiney, this profit of
ss.3nt. would be shared, reducing Long-
reach's share to $2.65m. On the present
capital of Longreach (including the
832,312 shares issued recently) of s2m.
contained in 8 million 25 cent shares,
this is equivalent to 33 cents per share
over the life of the mine.
The above estimate is perforce a
fairly rough one, as there are so many
unknown factors at this stage; how-
ever, if a “big brother” takes up a 50
percent interest in the development of
the mine, slightly less than 3 cents per
Longreach share can be added or sub-
tracted from variations in profit of
slm. over the life of the mine. The
length of the operation depends on the
actual size and structure of the ore
body and the most economic size of
plant, etc. But at least . this estimate
is on a fairly conservative basis of costs
and grades compared to assays so far
released and, although the current price
of the shares appears to place a fair
value on the St. Mungo No. 4 mine,
there do remain the other areas the
“Little Bit," where nine holes have been
drilled, 'and the “Blue Hills” area, for
which the company a little while ago
refused the offer of $333,000 for a one-
third interest. And quite apart from
these copper areas, the company was
lucky in that the phosphate deposits
discovered last year by Broken Hill
South Ltd. extend into its own leases.
COMMODITIES
Sugar's Defences
THE major long-term problem faced
by sugar, like most commodities,
is competition from synthetic pro-
ducts. The head of research for the
U.S. Sugar Research Foundation, Dr.
John L. Hickson, outlined the problem,
and sugar’s moves in defence, during a
recent address in South Africa. The
picture he gave applies not only to
the U.S. industry but to the rest of the
world.
Saccharin, the traditional synthetic
replacement, has been available for 80
years. But not until the advent of
cyclamates in the 1950 s did sugar feel
competition from man-made products.
Saccharin mixed with cyclamate has
been remarkably successful in capturing
a share of the market for sweeteners
in the buoyant soft-drink industry.
Cyclamate and other new synthetics
are readily synthesised from petroleum
or coal products. The chemical indus-
try has pushed into a state of con-
siderable over-supply in this field.
After the success in soft-drinks, the
synthetics manufacturers have switched
their attention to other foods and to
the home-co.oking market. As part of
its program to counter the threat from
synthetics, says Dr. Hickson, the
Foundation has studied the physical
effects of cyclamate consumption, “and,
I am happy to say, with results that
have become quite alarming.”
Although research is not yet com-
plete, and the Foundation is hardly
acceptable as an impartial observer,

A Master-Keyed System is one in which each
lock has its own individual key, which oper-
ates that lock only and no other, but where
each lock is also built to a Master-Key which
will open all locks in the group.
Within a Master-Keyed System, if required,
certain locks may be grouped in a section
Keyed-Alike to a given Service-Key, and still
subject to the Master-Key.

there is certainly some evidence that
cyclamates may be harmful. Experi-
ments with animals have indicated that
growth may be inhibited along with
other undesirable side-effects. Study
on these lines has been stepped up and
a showdown with the U.S. Foods and
Drugs Administration is likely this year.
Even partial success in establishing
the presence of harmful results from
! synthetic sweeteners could be of im-
portance for the sugar industry. On
another front, given the growing
pressure from synthetics, the sugar in-
dustry has been increasingly looking to
new outlets for its product. Chemicals
are the obvious target and, both in Aus-
tralia and elsewhere, there have been
useful steps in this direction.
One interesting example currently
attracting interest is detergent manu-
facture. Because the cheap ingredients,
formerly used in detergents, do not
readily break down after discharge into
drainage systems, there has been a
growing problem from contamination of
water supplies.
The shift away has begun and the
obvious next step is to more highly bio-
degradable products, which will be
broken down quickly. Sugar derivatives
will have a chance at this market in
the next few years.
THE London silver futures market
has eased by slightly under half a
cent an ounce following news of
a U.S. Treasury plan to hold prices.
The Treasury hopes to obtain Congress
permission to release for sale 431 mil-
lion ounces of the metal at present held
as backing for silver certificates. These
certificates are redeemable at any time
at a fixed price of 129.2 cents an
ounce.
Because of losses, and other problems,
it is thought that many of the out-
standing certificates may not be pre-
sented. But the real effect of the move,
if agreed, would not be great, only
delaying for a short time the day
when silver prices will rise to 140
cents or so—when it will be profitable
to melt down the now-obsolete U.S.
silver-based coinage.
THE tungsten ore market has been
quiet recently, with little con-
sumer or speculator interest.
Prices have held steady at 352/6 to
362/6 stg. a unit, despite the lack
of activity.
The U.S. stockpile sales appear to
have set a ceiling at the present level.
On the other hand, a price fall seems
unlikely on the present information
about consumption and supply.
The Canton Fair, traditional market
place for Chinese supplies, will give a
better picture of the supply position
in a few weeks.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Pricing the Retail Leaders
FIVE of the fifty stocks which make
up the Melbourne 50 Leaders
Index are retailers and there
should be some close resemblance in
terms of earnings per share. After
making adjustments in respect of new
issues and deducting tax at the full
standard rate, the position seems to
be:
Cents a share
rear ended in 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Si. J. Coles 6.7 73 74 79 79
David Jones 11 2 11 1 11 3 11 7 11 3
Myer Emporium 15.5 16 9 18 9 22 1 20 6
Waltons 68 76 74 66 67
Woolworths 4 9 5.7 6.5 7.5 8.2
There are obviously some consider-
able differences in absolute terms,
although some similarity seems to exist
between Coles, Waltons, and Wool-
worths. Growth over the period can
be judged by using an index based on
1962 = 100:
Year ended in 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
G. J. Coles 100 109 110 118 118
David Jones 100 99 101 104 101
Myer Emporium 100 109 122 143 133
Waltons JOO 112 109 97 99
Woolworths 100 116 133 153 167
These figures would suggest that
Woolworths has had the best growth
over this period.
As at the time of writing this article,
the last sale prices show the following
dividend yields and price/earnings
multiples (the price ranges for 1967
appear in the final column):
Last sale Dividend Price 1967
Company 10-3-1967 yield earnings range
G. J. Coles 1.15 4 8% 14 6 1 26-1.13
David Jones 1 27 5 3% 11 3 1 51-1 26
Myer Emporium 3.07 2 9% 14 9 3 21-3 03
Waltons .87 7 2% 13 0 1.05- .83
Woolworths 1 26 4 8% 15 5 1 33-1.19
From this last table, the following
judgments would be made:
1. At the present time, the stocks
are being priced in relation to past
growth rates of earnings per share.
2. Little account seems to be paid
to dividends per share in the pricing,
with the exception of Waltons, where
a relatively high dividend per share
seems to have sustained the share
price.
3. All the stocks are selling closer
to the low point for the year than the
high point.
The first judgment is probably not
an unreasonable one, for without very
strong evidence to the contrary in any
particular case it would be quite
reasonable to expect that growth in
retail sales generally would tend to
continue in much the same fashion as
it has in the past. So for those who
believe that dividends and earnings per
share are related, it would be reason-
able to expect that growth in dividend
income will match the growth in earn-
ings income. Perhaps it would be a good
idea at this stage to have a look at the
growth in dividend income in the past
but taking a rather longer period:
1959=100
Year ended in 1961 1962 1963 : 1964 1965 1966
G. J. Coles 111 129 129 129 137 137
David Jones 102 111 115 120 130 130
Myer Emporium 127 149 149 149 156 156
Waltons 126 137 144 160 160 160
Woolworths 114 117 117 121 121 121
Over this longer period there have
been quite good rates of growth, though
strangely enough Waltons shows the
highest rate. But if we look at the
period from 1962 we find that Coles
has increased by only 6 percent, David
Jones by 17 percent, Myers by less
than 5 percent, Waltons by 17 percent,
and Woolworths by 3 percent. So much
for dividend growth following earnings
growth. The highest growth in divi-
dends per share has come from the two
stocks with the lowest growth in earn-
ings per share.
The second judgment may be quite
fallacious, because a glance at the
immediate dividend yield might equally
well suggest that, by and large, invest-
ors are seeking a 5 percent yield from
retailers. This could be rationalised for
Myers by saying that a two-for-three
bonus issue maintaining the present
dividend per share is expected at any
moment. How the high yield of Waltons
would be explained is not clear, unless
it was thought that the conversion of
notes last July might have caused a
reduction in the dividend per share
from 6.25 cents to, say, 4.5 cents. The
confirmation of the dividend rate at 6.25
cents per share just recently should
have indicated quite clearly that no
such cut is in prospect.
Why the market seems to have
marked down the retailers at this point
is difficult to understand. It looks as
though the 1965/66 year was the bad
year. Since last August retail sales
generally have been increasing at quite
a good rate. The Christmas shopping
was at a high level, and while January
might have been quiet there is every
reason to believe that February was
quite a good month. Retailers generally
should have quite a good 1966/67 year,
even though they have to absorb the
basic wage increase of last year. The
initial costs of decimal currency con-
version are now behind them (although
some costs will still be incurred in
1966/67) and it is likely that customers
are becoming more and more accus-
tomed to seeing prices “doubled.” De-
pending to some extent on each indi-
vidual investor’s objectives, now would
seem a good time to buy shares in the
leading retailers. It would be desir-
able, though, to pick the one with the
best potential in the shorter term and
to invest all one’s “retailer” allocation
in that particular stock. It is possible
that, with the help of the Chartist and
the appraisal of the fundamental out-
look for each stock over the next five
weeks, such a selection may well be
possible.
For the rest of this article it seems a
good idea to have a look at some of
the industry factors and the potential
growth rates of sales generally, so that
these factors will be well in mind when
the individual stocks are considered.
First, the type of merchandise
handled by these five companies varies
quite considerably, although now that
Woolworths has moved into depart-
ment store retailing, it may well be
that the distinction previously made be-
tween Coles and Woolworths and the
other retailers may not be as neces-
sary. However, it does seem necessary
to have some idea of the companies
which have a large part of their turn-
overs in food and groceries. Food and
groceries are distinguished by the facts
that:
(a) After excluding motor vehicles,
parts, petrol, etc., from total retail
sales, food and groceries represents 38|
percent of the value. In 1958/59 this
percentage was 37J.
(b) Mark-ups on food items are very
low, even though the retailers strive to
get lower and lower prices from the
producers.
(c) The annual rate of growth in
money terms is much more stable than
any other group of goods.
The indices are:
1959=100
1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Food, etc. 115 119 123 129 138 147
Clothing, etc. 114 114 118 128 135 139
China, glass, etc. 11l 112 118 117 124 125
Electrical 115 113 118 125 132 127
Furniture 119 117 125 138 152 154
Secondly, labor costs are probably
the largest single item of expenses, so
any substantial increase in award rates
of pay can have quite a serious effect
on the net margin. Other expenses are
relatively unimportant, but the
amortisation of the cost of new build-
ings (or the rental cost) is probably
becoming of increasing importance with
the opening of new suburban stores or
shopping centres.
Finally, and perhaps the most im-
portant yet the most intangible, the
ability to appeal to the shopping
public’s many whims and fancies seems
to be vital in successful retailing. While
it may not be possible to demonstrate
this particular attribute in the follow-
ing articles, it is likely that past
achievements will be a guide, at least
in the relatively recent past, for once
this particular ability is gained it is
not easily lost.
The various companies will be dealt
with in the order they have been listed
in this article in an attempt to show
whether or not they are worth their
current price.

When's the right
Time for
Mining Shares
AS I’M STILL HOLDING a few
mining shares in the portfolio, perhaps
it’s not my prerogative to discuss the
collapse of the mining market. In my
defence, it’s not altogether a case of
mistiming. For so,me months I’d been
wary of tin, copper, lead, and zinc
shares, So, deliberately avoiding these
shares, I settled on the more unusual
metals. Thus the reason for Kathleen
Investments (uranium) and King
Island Scheelite (tungsten) being in the
portfolio. Although the outlook for
each of these metals is just as promis-
ing as it was in January, it has not
stopped these shares being marked down
in sympathy with the rest of the
mining market.
One of the more gentle falls has been
C.R.A. It baffles mb why these appar-
ently overpriced shares are not weaker.
Like the Cleveland Tin issue, there had
been considerable anticipation of the
Hamersley iron ore float. Now that it’s
finally been announced it all appears
somewhat of an anti-climax. First of
all the terms of the issue (a 400 per-
cent premium and a four-year-wait for
dividends) are pretty tough. If you
can swallow this and still come up
anxious for some shares, your entitle-
ment as a C.R.A. shareholder is
dwarfed by the amount available direct
from the underwriter.
So much attention has been paid to
the future of the mining industry in
Australia in the past year that the lack
of supply of mining shares has created
artificially high share prices. This
position is gradually changing. One
mining investment company has just
made its debut and another will be
appearing on the lists shortly. Now
there’s Hamersley about to take its
place on the board.
All this probably sounds as if I’ve
given the mining market away. On the
contrary, I’m stepping into 200 Mt.
Morgan at $2.65. I know the L.M.E.
copper price has weakened below the
£4OO sterling level, but the 25 percent
fall in Mt. Morgan’s share price still
seems ridiculously out of proportion.
The fall started just after the interim
report was published on February 3.
Not that you could blame the interim
report. Interim dividend was doubled
and a “considerably better” result than
the previous year was forecast. If noth-
ing else, we must get a reaction on
these shares.
Whereas the mining .market is for
the nimble, the industrial market in its
present state is designed for the plod-
der. We’re just about at the end of the
interim report season. While it’s been a
good one, it has exerted little impact
on the market. A survey on interim re-
porting was recently undertaken in
Melbourne. Among the replies was one
from a company which disliked the
practice of half-yearly reports “because
there was the risk of inflating share
values.” Not too much likelihood of that
happening today!
One share I did manage to buy before
a very good interim report was T. C.
Whittle. Any company that makes a
bonus issue early in its financial year
is always an interesting prospect. Thiess
Holdings and A. V. Jennings are two
of the most recent examples of this
practice and I do not think that share-
holders of either of these companies
have been disappointed.
The one-for-five bonus issue by T. C.
Whittle last year made no impact on
the upward trend in earning rate. To
push the earning rate up from 24 to
28 percent, the company must have
increased profits by 30 percent. The
share price of 70 cents gives little indi-
cation of this massive effort.
On the selling side was Pioneer Con-
crete at $1.21 and Tooheys at 99 cents.
Both excellent investments in the
medium term, but not likely to im-
prove much in the short term. The loss
on Tooheys was just about eliminated
by the profit on Pioneer Concrete.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
400 Pioneer Concrete $1.21 $474
400 Tooheys .99 $3BB
BOUGHT
500 T. C. Whittle .70 $358
200 Mt. Morgan $2.65 $542
The balance remaining in the account

Man on the Land
Wool Reserve Campaigners
and the Switch to Wheat
THE COMMITTEE SET UP by the
Australian Wool Board to investigate
marketing is to delay its report now
until the end of the year. It would be
' a good idea if the committee devoted
some time to a proper investigation of
the theory, being bandied about at pre-
sent, that lack of a reserve price, or
similar, scheme will cause many wool-
growers to switch from wool to wheat.
Sir William Gunn, chairman of the
■ Board, has been reported as saying that
this is likely to happen. Various leaders
in various newspapers and journals
have weighed in with support for this
theory which, in our view, is merely a
supposition and a rather doubtful one
at that. If there are reasons for a
thange in the marketing system for
vool (and there may be), these reasons
must be properly documented.
From personal experience (always
rseful) and a preliminary checking of
the available statistics (we do not claim
anything more than that), we conclude
that wheatgrowing invariably leads, in
Australia, to an increase, not q
decrease, in wool production. We chal-
lenge Sir William Gunn, the Wool
Board, the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics, anyone in fact, to produce
factual evidence of any loss in wool
production resulting from introduction
of wheat to any given district.
In the broad sense, the growing of
wheat is a more intensive land use.
The fact that it is wheat that is grown
is important, but not as important as
the more intensive use of land, resources
and technology. Wheat has been grown
in Australia since the 1880 s. However,
the two big increases in overall acreage
and production came after World War
I and World War 11. Each coincided
with a dramatic increase in wool pro-
duction. The two have always gone
together.
Taking two specific areas, the Wim-
mera and Mallee, it may be concluded
that the introduction of wheat resulted
in a threefold increase in sheep numbers
and wool production. Without being
dogmatic, it would be reasonable, we
think, to suggest that similar, if not
quite so remarkable, patterns apply
elsewhere in Australia. The greatest ex-
pansion in wheatgrowing in Australia
has taken place since 1945. We have,
this year, the biggest crop in history
(possibly 450 million bushels) and the
acreage record (which stood since
1928) has been broken also.
Sheep numbers have increased re-
markably in the same period. Approxi-
mately 60 million sheep have been
added since 1945 and probably half of
these have been added as a direct result
of the more intensive land use brought
about by the wheat expansion.
If a man is equipped to grow wheat
he is equipped to improve pastures.
When he goes in for wheat he needs
tractors, harrows, ploughs, scarifiers, etc.
and, more important, the technical
ability to use them. It is not imperative
that the fallowing method be used to
grow wheat, but in Australia it is the
proven and tested method. More than
this, it can be shown that, almost
without exception, the best wheat crops
come from land which was previously
under clover pasture. Competitions,
held every year, district by district,
show a remarkable number of prize-
winning crops coming from this
system.
It is not, we hasten to add, a neces-
sary pattern, but it is the pattern
which does exist and seems likely to
continue to exist. It is no use compar-
ing Australia with Canada or the
United States, where much of the wheat
lands are under snow in the winter
months. It may, however, be useful to
compare Australia with southern areas
of Russia, where wheat has been intro-
duced on a large scale and where lack
of a fallowing pattern may have been
one of the reasons for disastrous
results.
The change in land use, following
the introduction of wheat (or any
grain, for that matter), can, and should,
be measured statistically. Just as im-
portant is the change in attitudes. The
occupier becomes more a farmer and
less a grazier. But he runs as many
sheep, or more sheep, on a smaller
area. His property becomes better
fenced and therefore more manageable.
Lambing losses, from natural causes,
decrease. On the other hand, the closer
system of grazing results in more
danger from diseases, and the farmer
relies more heavily on the veterinarian
and professional adviser. His employees
change, too. Instead of boundary riders
he needs technicians.
From the time the first sheep go on
to the wheat stubble the farmer’s atti-
tude to fodder conservation alters. In-
stead of fodder conservation being a
drought insurance, or a supplementary
measure, it becomes an integral part of
livestock management. Hay, silage, and
grain are to be used rather than stored.
As an illustration we mention the
change in one property, well known to
us, over the past 35 years. In the 1930 s
this property was being utilised in
exactly the same way as it had been
since 1890 when it was cleared. It was
running sheep for wool. The operators
consisted of a manager and seven stock-
men. Their tools were one truck, about
30 horses, and ten sheep dogs. The
stockmen, with one exception, were
drifters who came and went as they
pleased. The only attempt at pasture
improvement in those days was a burn-
off every now and again. Today, in
1967, the same property has been
utterly transformed. It maintains three
permanent families, carries more sheep
than in 1938, grows wheat and oats,
has three times the number of pad-
docks, has improved yards and build-
ings, the paddocks are regularly
supered, machinery includes four
trucks, and three tractors, with a wide
range of implements, and spray irriga-
tion for lucerne has been introduced.
It is by no means an unusual pro-
perty. This sort of thing has been hap-
pening everywhere, and it was the de-
cision to go in for wheat which, more
than anything else, prompted the
change.
It would appear, in retrospect,- alto-
gether logical, but the point, which may
have been missed, is that all the time
this was happening the people con-
cerned were adjusting in various ways.
Some resisted all along the line and,
seeing that the entire exercise was
being carried out with borrowed money,
they may have had some justification
for their attitude. Whether the exercise
would have been possible without
planned marketing of wheat is a valid
question. And part of this question re-
volves around the attitude that a cer-
tain guaranteed price for wheat and a
free price for wool can be, to the
farmer, an attractive arrangement.
This is the crux of the wool/wheat
relationship not the supposition that
it is a choice between the one and the
other.

On this account it is somewhat em-
barrassing that only rare reference has
been made to matters of prime interest
to homemakers. The scantiness of solid
information to recount to them reflects
an unsatisfactory state of affairs. The
regrettable fact is that professional
agriculture in this country has scarcely
concerned itself with the troubles that
crowd in on the distaff side. Domestic
science, or home economics as this area
of organised knowledge is called in
the United States, is still to be properly

A Service for readers. That difficult to obtfli
volume, let us find it for you—fiction, text boc
biography, history, etc. Moderate fee only
successful.
modern life is now emphasising the
seriousness of this omission.
Recently a housewife wrote plain-
tively to one of our esteemed daily
newspapers expressing bewilderment
that nobody seemed to care that can-
ned fruit consists mainly of syrup. So
far no one has offered her an ex-
planation. Health authorities feel their
work is done when they satisfy them-
selves that the food has been hygienic-
ally wrapped and is not likely to make
anyone suddenly and violently ill.
They don’t worry about the more subtle
and insidious dangers. Consumption
of too much of this syrup, which is
almost entirely sugar and water, could
induce vitamin deficiency and conse-
quently predispose the victim to various
illnesses. People at greatest risk would
be those whose diets already tended to
contain a fairly high proportion of
carbohydrate and to be rather light
on vitamin-rich foods. Many school-
children, teenagers, and young adults
have such a diet, even in this country
where protein is relatively cheap and
abundant. The process of carbohydrate
—sugar and starch—digestion saps the
vitamins supplied by other foods. Yet
almost all housewives have been left
with the naive but blissful belief that
fruit is good for you. It is, too, if it
hasn’t been sprayed with certain chemi-
cals and if you take the precaution to
pour the syrup down the sink.
One often hears housewives say these
days that home bottling no longer pays.
But is this right when the manufacturer
is selling you a tin of water with some
fruit floating in it and sugar added?
And another cute little trick must be
taken into the reckoning: some canners
have reduced the traditional one pound
tin to 15 ounces. Only the few hard-
bitten ones amongst us, who have
learned that it pays to read the smaller
print on labels, would ever note the
difference. If it is any comfort to our
boat-rocking housewife to know, Aus-
tralian canned fruit for the dxport
market is a remarkably different pro-
duct to the one she gets from her local
grocer.
The Commonwealth Department of
Primary Industry sees to this. It has a
mother-like interest in foreigners’
bowels, on the pretext that such con-
cern will keep our pockets full. But
of what use is this when the money
won’t buy good food for our own
tables or through ignorance we mis-
spend the extra cents we get! Do
you know offhand whether you get
.more food value when you buy “king
size” rather than standard eggs or
whether, indeed, at any given set of
prices pullet eggs represent the best buy.
Puzzlement and home-making go
hand in hand. Few men would tolerate
as many unanswered questions in the
course of running their jobs, especially
if they knew that answers were avail-
able or could be provided after a little
research. In food management there are
traps no matter what is on the menu.
Chicken has become enticingly cheap,
and fish, by comparison, seems fright-
eningly dear. The broiler industry is
doing well and the fishing industry is
depressed. Yet a dollar spent on cer-
tain seafoods can still buy about the
same amount of sustenance as a dollar
spent on chicken, and provide you with
a tastier meal. Let us not mention the
jungle of dile,mmas in the red-meat
market. And why, for goodness sake,
has potato consumption fallen so low?
At usual prevailing prices scarcely any
better food can be bought. Popular
opinion notwithstanding, potatoes are
less fattening than many of the foods
that diet-conscious people mistakenly
substitute for them. Whoever saw a fat
Irishman in the great days of the
murphies! Dairy products are no longer
the pure, straight-forward foods they
used to'be.
Departments of Agriculture should
look beyond the number of bushel
baskets filled and study food more
earnestly from the homemaker’s point
of view. Then, having found answers
to the sort of questions raised here,
they should not in their characteristic
way hide their light under a bushel, but
tell us all loudly and often what is best
for the family’s health and economy as
the prices, choices, and rackets
change.
Domestic science, of course, entails
far more than the selection, prepara-
tion, and storage of food. For instance,
the South Australian Department of
Agriculture devoted several pages of its
latest monthly journal to advise home-
makers about their real need for air-
conditioners. Most people living in the
southern half of the continent and
tempted to get with the current fad for
house cooling would be well advised to
read the article, which is entitled, “Are
Air Conditioners Really Necessary?” I
before busting several hundred dollars.
The information reported is drawn from
a study conducted by Mrs. Ann Mar-
shall, a lecturer in geography at the
University of Adelaide. It is good that
somebody has investigated this ques-
tion, and the department is to be con-
gratulated for publishing the findings.
However, the department itself should
have its own staff for such work. The
proper home for domestic science is
the Department of Agriculture. Why
can’t Mrs. Marshall be paid at the same
level in the department as she is in the
university for doing the same work?
Until such idiocy is left behind,
domestic science will continue to
languish.


LETTERS
Cut the Strings
You have quoted, out of context, a
statement by the Duke of Edinburgh
(in the section “All Their Own Work”)
in regard to fostering British industry.
Australians certainly should not regard
themselves as coming under the defini-
tion of British in this context.- This
refers to British national industry, and
there is a world of difference between
a British national and a British sub-
ject. Anyone who has applied for a
job in the U.K. which stipulates that
applicants must be British will learn
the difference very quickly. They are
referring to British nationals, so that
Australians are automatically excluded.
The term British subject means what it
says a person subject to Britain. So
the Duke of Edinburgh was referring
to U.K. industry and was talking to
U.K. industrialists. The British are
hard-headed enough about trade and
the money it brings, and it is time Aus-
tralia was the same. It is quite unneces-
sary to invest our trade relations in the
U.K. with some sort of mystic tie.
After all, we can effectively trade with
other countries without this type of
claptrap. Let’s do it cut the strings!
Go the whole hog eliminate the
Union Jack from the Australian flag as
Canada has done, remove the unneces-
sary appendage of British royalty and
“God Save the Queen” as an anthem,
remove the other anachronism of Com-
monwealth trade preference and
appoint Australians always to the
Governor-Generalship and to the State
Governorships. Furthermore, Australia
needs only our official representatives
in the U.K. at the Ambassadorial level,
and the outdated system of Agent-
Generals for individual States needs to
be eliminated.
B. R. HEWITT
Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia)
The Melbourne See
With all the goodwill in the world, I
am still puzzled by Henry Grant’s
clamor (8., Feb. 25) for “public de-
bate” on appointment of a Melbourne
Catholic Archbishop. Why should it be
“obvious that in the Melbourne con-
text an outstanding appointment is
vital?” Why is it even an “issue” of
any kind at all?
I suggest that the only context which
should be the concern of any church-
man at present is that provided by
Father Charles Davis, a “leading Bri-
tish Catholic theologian” whose Press
statement on December 20, announc-
ing he was leaving his church, was
that his “Christian commitment is in-
separable from concern for truth and
for people. I do not find either of
these represented by the official
Church.”
That I may be seen to be quite
impartial, may I add to the above
“context” Anglican Archbishop Gough’s
testimony to “the conglomeration of
human interpretations and traditions
and man-made regulations which for
so long the Church has had the
temerity to declare as divinely revealed
doctrines.”
This, surely, is a vital issue for any-
one capable of seeing that the Church
of today is not “built upon a Rock,”
as generally asserted, but is well on the
way, in slow motion, to joining the
Gadarene swine.

The Masons
Michael Baume in “The Masons”
(8., Jan. 21) presented that body and
its modern problems fairly and impar-
tially. There are other aspects which he
has not touched upon worth considering.
The first, that the lowliest member of
the Craft can, and does, meet and
mingle with the highest and be wel-
comed with the right hand of sincere
and brotherly friendship. Thus men in
high office in the government of the
country, leaders in professions, com-
merce and industry, whatever their
status in the Craft, meet on the level
with so many who fill much less im-
portant roles.
The second is the antiquity of the
Craft. There is not a little resemblance
to Masonry in the initiation ceremonies
and advancement to higher degrees
that were so rigidly observed by our
own tribal Aborigines. While this can
only be a surmise, at least it suggests
that Masonry may have originated as
tribal instruction of youth to prepare
them for the responsibilities of man-
hood.
As Mr. Baume points out in a quota-
tion from the English Grand Lodge,
Masonry is not a religion nor a sub-
stitute for religion. But if it inculcates
high moral standards and principles,
along with the urge to study and
appreciate the Bible, it is of very great
value to the community in general.
EDGAR WRIGHT
Castle Hill (N.S.W.)
The Family Farm
“Man on the Land” has a quaint idea
of the attitude and aims of the organ-
isations whose members accept and
propagate the economic philosophy of
Henry George, to which he refers in
his article “Threats to the Family
Farm” (8., March 25). To suggest that
they “would like to see the family
farm disappear” can only derive
from a very garbled understanding of
the “Georgist” concept of the site rent.
The price of acquiring a farm of
reasonable size and capacity is now
beyond the reach of the very people
best suited to make a success of this
type of farming. Subsidies are an im-
portant contributory factor to these
high prices.
The Georgists want to get down to
the cause of this economic mess; the
fact that society generates a surplus
product which manifests itself as econ-
omic rent and attaches itself to the
more desirable sites be they farm
lands or city blocks; and that this
economic rent, or site rent, by its very
nature the natural revenue of govern-
ments, is enjoyed privately, being capi-
talised into “land values;” providing
unearned incomes on the one hand,
and unbearable burdens on industry,
agriculture, and commerce, on the other.
Ihe basic cause, in fact, of the seem-
ingly permanent imbalance in society
the poverty that dogs the progress.
Drawing off this site rent revenue
into the national treasury would break
the evil chain of ever-rising “land
values,” would gradually reduce the
price of land to nil, would free millions
of dollars of capital for enterprises at
present starved of it, eliminate the
necessity to tax private earnings and
the need for excise and other revenue-
producing duties which check the free
flow of trade.

ence might be of some value as a
guideline to rationalisation of the forces,
Just prior to World War II Canada
combined her three Ministries of the
Army, Navy, and Air Force into the
Department of National Defence,
effectively amalgamating the Civil Ser-
vice positions, while retaining the
separate Line and Staff Functions of
each Service. The Chiefs-of-Staff of the
three services retained their own head-
quarters and functions, but were sub-
ordinated to the Joint Chief-of-Staff,
who was picked in rotation from each
of the three services.
This system worked quite well during
the war and post-war years, although
the various services still had consid-
erable duplication of functions within
their headquarters.
In 1963, with the issue of the White
Paper on defence, armed forces inte-
gration took a leap forward. Chaplain
and medical services had already been
unified for some years, and it was quite
common to have an Army doctor or
dentist on board ship, or an Air Force
nurse in an Army hospital. The next
step was to integrate the various other
duplicate organisations: recruiting,
material procurement, engineering and
maintenance, etc. This resulted in a
great saving of manpower and money.
Suddenly, within the same budget, the
money which had been previously spent
on duplicating efforts between the three
services became available for the pro-
curement of new and desperately
needed equipment. The Field Force
units which had been living from
hand-to-mouth were suddenly rich in
weapons, vehicles, and radios they had
been lacking.
The continuing process from inte-
gration to unification is still in. progress,
and the full results cannot yet be seen.
However, we in Australia should take
a long, hard look at what has been
achieved in Canada and start thinking
about how we can get a “bigger bang
for a buck.”

The Fictionaires
Charles Higham in “The Fictionaires”
(8., Feb. 25) stated that Alan Yates
(Carter Brown) once wrote a book in
four days. It was a remarkable feat,
but I derived a certain amount of
satisfaction from the knowledge that
the writer for whom I work in my
spare time once wrote a novel of com-
parable length in three nights, after
having spent each day toiling at his
desk in his normal, full-time job.
This, to me, represents a far greater
feat, particularly as the writer is only
22 and has not the experience of
Yates. The novel was accepted for pub-
lication the following week, and the
writer, A. Corbett Sullivan, was offered
a contract by the publishing house.

colour me black
Think of a black panther and you think of graceful
movement. Sleek and fast.
But think of carbon black and what do you see?
Things like tyres and engine mountings and carbon
paper. All very essential, but somehow taken for
granted.
Until you take a good look at Australian Carbon Black.
Now ACB has installed a Monsanto Oscillating Disk
Rheometer. This apparatus allows manufacturers to
determine the cure and processing characteristics of
their rubber compounds rapidly and concisely.
It takes experience to come out with advancements like
these. And enthusiasm. The same enthusiasm and know-
how that pioneered the bulk delivery of carbon blacks,
cutting packaging and handling costs and resulting in
substantial savings to users, is behind every development
at ACB.
The enthusiasm that has now made it possible to
“put a panther in your tyre” will lead to better products,
further economies. All to the benefit of the manufacturer
and the consumer.
So when you think of black, will you think of us?
