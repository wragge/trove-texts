The Bookish Ghosts of Dr. Huggins
I have just returned from the funeral
(which was possibly the best way out of the
difficulty) of the very eminent Dr. Huggins
—Owen Glyndwr Huggins, so called in pro-
phetic anticipation, because he could call up
spirits, and hardly knew what to do with
them when they came. It was a very big
and imposing funeral, for Huggins, though
only 46, had made a name. And I think
there were people there whom the others
didn’t see, for though visible enough at night,
the kind I was seeking are very shadowy
when the sun is shining and require to be
carefully looked for. Some of them sat on
the wall of the cemetery. One was up a
tree. One got between the clergyman and
his book and dimmed his glasses. It was
all very creepy. Now Huggins has left me
the sole repository of the secret as to. how
the bottom fell out of literature, though he
has taken the recipe with him. Also he has
left me the spirits.
After the funeral I changed my name m
a cab, drove straight to a railway station, and
departed for indefinite travel. I telegraphed
instructions about money and my resigna-
tion of my job as Huggins’s executor. My
rooms can slide till the landlord sells the
contents for rent. So can Huggins’s rooms
and contents. I am not afraid of any of
the contents. They were , never violent or
threatening with me, and the only one I met
was most interesting to talk to. Still, I
can’t be quite sure that Huggins’s brilliant
career ended naturally, and though my
career isn’t brilliant it is the only one I
have, and I don’t want to lose it. My address
to all save my lawyer is “Poste Restante,
the World, to be Called For.” If the Public
Trustee or the Curator of Intestate Estates,
who takes over things, wants information
about any queer assets he can write me
We were at college together, and there
we and half a dozen others happened
on old Professor Bearward, who had the
spiritualistic craze badly. He was a tall,
thin man with a large pale face that looked
like the clock on a post-office tower. He
used to correspond with Sir Oliver Sludge,
who agreed with 'him, and Lombroso, who
mocked at him; and he wrote occasionally
for Borderland when W. T. Bedstead ran
it and his spook Julia turned the handle
of the printing-machine.
The original members of Bearward s
society dropped out of our ken when they
went into the world and got busy, but I
still dabbled because I was rich and a loafer
and required a few hobbies. And Huggins
still dabbled because he specialised as far
as possible in mental diseases almost as
soon a 3 he began to practise, and he found
a connection between the two lines of dis-
order.
Our experiences with the common or
garden spectre were as unsatisfying as usual.
No ghost ever tells how far his new residence
is away, the state of the road, the land-
marks along the road, the speed of travel or
anything else that is tangible. Napoleon, when
called up, knows neither French nor Italian
and thinks the best way to attack an enemy
is to drop bricks on him from a height; and
the unpublished poem that Shelley dictates
would have been rejected by the Weekly
Fenian published at Tralee (Ireland). But
Huggins was interested in the mental state
of the ghost-raisers and diagnosed their case
as a specific form of insanity. If it was
caused by ghosts then there were ghosts, and,
on the other hand, if it caused the ghosts
then it appeared that most ghosts were mad.
It was only a side-line with him, and Jie
would probably have soon dropped it if he
hadn’t struck a track of his own which led
to confusion. Something about the son of
Hamlet’s father, who was an obviously
lunatic spectre—not Hamlet, but another son
unnamed and possibly non-existent, whom
he diagnosed by reading between the lines
and especially by some remarks that Banquo
let fall —helped to set him on a new course
of investigation.
He devoted himself to materialising the
unborn, as being fresher, less mouldy, less
dissipated and more promising than the dead.
Of course there is no satisfaction in material-
ising an infant that can’t talk, but Dr. Hug-
gins (who set out to grow a shaggy beard
about this time) discovered that a child be-
gins to grow spiritually on the day when it
should have been born but wasn’t. The
ruck of our spiritualistic acquaintances, of
whom we were both tired, were shut out
from this special line of thought. We con-
ducted it ourselves. The doctor did it with
enthusiasm. I did it by habit and because
I was useful to hold bottles, mix liquors, lift
the other end of the magic spell when it was
too long and heavy for one to handle, and
buy suspicious substances which the doctor
didn’t care to purchase himself —bones, flesh,
phosphates and the like.
The results, which I saw little of, were
allegedly remarkable. Huggins reckoned that
if the war resumed in 1939 he would be able
to reinforce France with 2,000,000 material-
ised spirits, all aged over 21, all intensely
patriotic and all wild with rage because they
should have been born between 1914 and
1918, but their chance had been destroyed.
And about this time the thought drifted
across my mind that if I were ever attacked
by delirium tremens, acute dementia, visions,
softening of the brain, hydrophobia or cata-
lepsy, I would call in some other medical
attendant than Huggins* even though he was
at the top of his profession and had enough
letters, honors, dignities and learned degrees
trailing after his name to make • a tail for
Hippocrates’ comet.
Then came the crowning discovery, and
even if some of the others were delusions
this was real enough, for it shook the world
and would have made my lamented friend
famous if he had dared to explain it.
Dr. Huggins developed the idea that char-
acters in fiction might be materialised —prac-
tically brought to life, in fact. Supposing
the character had all the necessary human
attributes, that it had been created by an
author who possessed a soul and he had put
his soul into the work of creation, then the
character had a soul, and one that would last
as long as the book endured. Anything with a
soul Dr. Huggins believed he could clothe in a
temporary human semblance and hold con-
verse with, and a great creature of the
imagination would be better company than
the wraith of a defunct person, possibly a
mere clod at heart, who couldn’t even be
identified with certainty. Nat Gould’s heroes
were barred as impossible, but Dickens was
looked upon as a promising field for exploita-
tion. The doctor was knighted about this
time and became Sir Theophilus Huggins...lt
was the culminating point in his career.
I wasn’t invited to help in the experimen-
tal work in the usual large-hearted, off-hand
way. In fact, about this time the doctor
began to develop a curious reticence and a
far-off look in the eyes. He also began to
forgeti to change his collar, but a man who
is both rich and famous can afford to be
eccentric. And when he invited me to a
supper, to begin at one minute past mid-
night precisely, with David Copperfield as
the third guest, I felt a curious sensation
about the spine. I resolved to go, of course.
Such a chance couldn’t be missed. But I
resolved quite firmly that if I ever found
myself in the last stage of senile decay I
would telephone for some medico who was
not Sir Theophilus Huggins. And I car-
ried a small revolver, if David Copperfield
proved to be a robust and dangerous
lunatic or criminal—and broke
into violence, I meant to scatter the brains
of Dickens’s leading character over the car-
pet in self-defence and let the world get on
as best it could without him. I had begun
the study of law when I left college, though.
I dropped it early, and even if the visitor
was real I knew enough to be sure that
spirits might be shot with impunity.
After all, there was no tragedy. The visi-
tor, whom I jostled on the doormat, so punc-
tual was he, was a youngish man, quite plea-
sant and intelligent, dressed according to the.,
early-Victorian period, and really the most
agreeable sham I ever met. He ate and
drank, or seemed to do so, which I thought
was against the rules of the game; but then
I remembered that it was a perfectly new
game and probably had no rules yet. He
talked interestingly about all the people and
events in the book, and I realised that he
was supposed, until his education progressed,
to know nothing in the world except what
was in the book. In fact, Huggins explained
as much to both of us. David’s hours for
materialisation, it seemed, were limited from
midnight to 4 a .in. or the false dawn £>r
cockcrow, the same as Hamlet’s father, who
also lived in a book. Only Sir Theophilus
Huggins knew how to raise David ; _ David
couldn’t raise himself, not being in the
secret. Huggins said they would have many
nights together, and he would rouse up
other characters to join in. I lay back in
a chair and watched this well-got-up actor,
and wondered whether the doctor was a dupe
or was devising some immense hoax, and
what on earth he expected to gain out of it.
I had intended to wait and see the curious
fraud off the premises, perhaps follow him.
Bfit about 2.30 I decided that it was a very
poor show and went home.
There quite mechanically . I picked up
Dickens’s masterpiece to see- if I could find
any points in which the actor had failed, and
I got the surprise of my life and also the
surprise of the century. A little later it was
the surprise of the world. That, episode of
1921 put the letters of Junius and the liter-
ary forgeries of William Henry Ireland and
the Book v>f Mormon into the shade. Cop-
perfield himself wasn’t in the book. He
wasn’t even on the cover. He had got out
and gone to sup with Huggins. All the other
characters were there, but Murdstone and
Creakle, who used to wallop David, spanked
the empty air, and the hand that smote
Uriah Heep on the jaw had no more name
or identity attached to it than the hand
that wrote on Belshazzar’s wall, and Dora
married an empty space.
No doubt everything would be right about
daybreak if David ran to the time-table that
Huggins had laid down for him, and in this
country his absence might hardly be noticed,
for few people read even the best fiction in
the small hours of the morning. But if the
effect was universal and not merely local
there would be a devil of a row at the other
side of the world, where the absence would
begin about noon. The wires would be red-
hot with the news. The offence, so far as I
could guess, came under three principal
headings—kidnapping, breach of copyright
and breakage of any old unrepealed laws
against wizardry. There was also a possible
charge of damaging national monuments —
the same as when the French Communards
pulled down the Vendome Column. The
Foreign Enlistment Act might be quoted if
some day Copperfield, instead of coming back
to his book, joined an alien army. Then
there was the possibility of being sentenced
to death by the obsolete process of Bill of
Attainder, which applies where the com-
munity thinks someone unsafe, yet doesn’t
know exactly what is wrong with him, and
there was the certainty of being murdered by
some religious maniac who thought the Scrip-
ture in danger. Provided Huggins pursued
his career all these .things were fairly cer-
tain for the criminal if he was found out,
and Huggins might insist on being found
out. There was no advertisement if he
wasn’t, and a man with the glare and beard
and collar that he had taken to wearing
would be quite reckless. No man with
these appurtenances could be otherwise. His
accomplice would also, probably, have a bad
time, and my long association with the doctor
made me look very like an accomplice, with
the added drawback that I couldn’t buy
immunity by telling how it was done. On
consideration I took an early train into the
country and left the world of cities to boil
over by itself. And how it boiled is a matter
of history.
I watched results for a few weeks from
a safe distance. Huggins didn’t announce
himself, after all. Probably he didn’t enjoy
himself much. His discovery led nowhere.
It was of no more real value than a two-
headed kangaroo of a blue giraffe. It didn’t
even profess, like the old spook-raising game,
to show the way to the hereafter or to shed
a light on the herebefore. There was no
money in it, and nobody was likely to be
made a duke because of it. In fact, the
community was more likely to tear Sir Theo-
philus’s knighthood from him if he was
located than give him a fresh gaud. The
great discovery didn’t help literature, but
put a blight on it. Only the most human,
characters were amenable to treatment; the
kind that had no soul didn’t respond. I
could tell the increasing dimensions of Hug-
gins’s supper-parties through watching the
gaps in the masterpieces of fiction. Then
his patients began to get out of hand and
be late —sometimes days or weeks late —in
returning to their accustomed pages. As
they rubbed shoulders together the good ones
deteriorated. Little Dorrit, for instance,
couldn’t associate over the festive early-
morning board with Daniel Quilp and not
lose some of her bloom. (The way Huggins
struck to Dickens was amazing, but if his
career had lasted longer he would doubtless
have raged over a wider space.) Some of
them became almost too fat on Huggins’s
viands to fit into the old story, which be-
came overcrowded, askew and out of joint.
They even got into wrong books, Sarah
Gamp once taking the place .of Oliver Twist.
One or two heroines gave way to drink,
notably Kate Niekleby, whom Sir Mulberry
Hawk refused to marry in consequence of
juniper leaves in her hair.
Sir Theophilus Huggins’s supper parties
became rather, loud and notorious in the
building where his luxurious chambers were
located, but it was merely regarded as a
case of one more’ good man going on the
ballet-girl track when he was old enough
to know better. His practice suffered, but
he was too rich to care about that. Nobody
suspected anything, for nobody had the key
to the mystery. Certainly martial law had
been proclaimed, and a royal commission
appointed, also a day of prayer for rain, and
the booksellers’ shops were picketed, and some
of the most deeply affected books had been
burnt by the common hangman, in the hope
of stopping the rot, and disinfectants had
been used, and representations had been
made to foreign Powers, but these were mere
experiments made at random. The doctor’s
guests attracted no attention so far as the
eye was concerned, and as the cooking and
waiting were done by characters out of books
there were no servants to tell tales. But
there is every reason to believe that the
crowd was demoralised and unmanageable.
I assume they rounded on their creator and
benefactor. Anyhow, he was found dead
amid the debris of a banquet at which 10
guests had attended (I can identify nine of
them). His remains lay amid a scene of
unparalleled disorder. Doors and window’s
were fastened inside, so I presume the visitors
dematerialised after the doctor’s death and
left by the keyhole. A vast theatrical ward-
robe lay on the floor just where it had fallen
off them. And with all this evidence the
police described it as the mysterious dis-
appearance of a theatrical company which
had left its properties behind it and gone
away naked, and concluded that after they
were gone the host had locked the door and
committed suicide.
Eight of the guests are still unaccounted
for in literary circles, but I saw them at the
funeral. Evidently they are homeless. I
presume they expect the executor to wind
up their affairs as well as those of the de-
ceased. I wouldn’t be that executor for a
great deal.
JAMES EDMOND.
Our Chief Asiatic Import
.. When the Arabs gave us figures they con-
ferred a very doubtful blessing on the
human race. All the commercialism which
has kept the world at groaning point since
the days when Richmond exterminated Rich-
ard 111. at Bosworth Field and became
Henry VII. springs from the Arab invention.
Consider the happy Roman way of doing
arithmetic. Here is a little sum for the
junior class:
LXIX.
CCCLXXVIII. i
CCXXXVII. .
cccxxvm.
CDLXXXVIII.
Add that up quickly and get MD. It seems
a very small total for such a lot of capitals;
but you get used to that sort of thing when
you realise the genius of the scheme
and know that MMDL is 2550; while
CCCLXXXVIII is only 388. Very few of
the budding mathematicians of Rome got
beyond addition and subtraction; for when
it came to dividing DLXXVII into
MCCCXXXVIII most of the very boldest
turned pale and decided to take a risk as
politicians rather than face the certain dan-
gers of decimal fractions done in alphabeti-
cal chaos of the sort. Then the Arabs came
along and ruined the world. The man who
had previously seen the stars, loved the lilt
of song, breathed with sweet unconcern the
breath of the Spring and left the job of count-
ing to slaves and hirelings had to take an
interest in arithmetic. Very soon he could
take an interest in hardly anything else.
The figures got him ; he had .to continually
face them ; they danced between him and the
sun and moon; they were served up at
breakfast and mixed into his drinks; in
many cases he mistook them for poetry and
ran his business to rhymes that he called
balances. It was all very sad; and the deep-
est degradation followed. The successes of
the brown people in Europe were almost
entirely due to figures. All the spirit had
been taken out of the white man both in
the east and west through trying to set his
life to the new sums. The Moors broke into
Spain and France; the Turks hammered
their way to the Danube; resistance died
on the hum of broken nations working
the rule of three. The figures upset
empires, destroyed nations, _ overthrew
morality and religion, and went like a disease
through the world until they had completely
routed leisure and philosophy. Of all the
ills the white race has suffered at the hands
of Asia, figures are incomparably the worst.
They are entirely opposed to the free
European ideals, utterly at variance with
the make and shape of the Aryan soul. The
fact that CCCXLVII and CCVIII made
DLV could be accepted by the ancient world
as a scientific statement which had only a
remote and occasional connection with daily
life ; but to-day such facts in continuous and
desolating procession fill all the hours of the
clock. Still, the remedy lies in our own
hands if we are daring enough to follow the
true white man’s instinct and be honest
with ourselves. The first step to anarchy—
which, properly understood, is socialism in
its practical form and individualism touch-
ing its ideals —is the declaration that all
figures are black. The things are foreign-
made, a product of Asiatic labor; and all
the evils of taxation, capitalism, sweating
and political' corruption are to be directly
traced to them. Let us send them back
whence they came; the modern world has no
time for them. In Arabia some brown per-
son can still sit under a palm-tree, while
his camel paws at his knee, reciting the mul-
tiplication table to Allah and the stars - , but
that is not fit occupation for the children
of Hercules, John of Gaunt and Cuchulain.
Consider it! The great cities of the world
spend nearly all the hours of sunshine work-
ing with figures—doinfe the sums an Arab
set them ! It is high time the thraldom of
Asia were broken and we came back to hon-
est modes of book-keeping in which a plain
fMMMDCCCLXXXVIII stood for the pre-
sent barbarous £3BBB.

HIS illustration gives an idea of
* the commodious premises in
which James Barnes, Ltd., manu-
facture at Alexandria their Linseed
Oil and Meal. The industry was estab-
lished at the outbreak of the war,
when Australia found it impossible to
get supplies from the Old Country
and elsewhere. Commencing with a
modest monthly output of about 6000
gallons the business has grown to
one of very large dimensions, orders
coming regularly from every corner
of Australia, New Zealand and the
islands in ever increasing figures. To-
day Barnes’s Linseed Oil is as well
known as the best British makes both
for quality and the general excellence
of its manufacture. The Oil-meal
product is just as popular among
farmers as the oil is desired by the
painter. The prosperous farmer to-
day is he who gives a daily ration of
linseed-oil meal to his cows, horses,
sheep, pigs and poultry.

ON the farm, in the home, garage, factory, work-
shop, or mine OXY-ACETYLENE Welding
is playing a big part in the campaign of economy.
No longer do farmers waste time and money over spare parts when
implements break down in the busy season. In the motor world,
the ability of the Oxy-Acetylene Welder to repair cracked frames,
cylinders, crank and gear cases, etc., has long passed the stage of
wonder. Metal kitchen utensils, broken garden tools, and num-
erous metal articles in the home, which previously went to the.
rubbish heap, are now quickly made strong as new, for a trifling
amount, by the nearest Oxy-Acetylene Welder.
Day after day, when breakdowns threaten to hold up entire factory
plants, Oxy-Acetylene Welders speedily repair the most intricate
fractures in huge machinery parts at a fraction of the cost of
replacement. And in the manufacture of metal products from the-
sheet, bar, or pipe, Oxy-Acetylene Welding not only increases out-
put, but produces an article of higher selling value at infinitely
lower cost compared with seaming, riveting, or brazing.
Whatever the broken or worn article is composed of—-cast or wrought iron, mild
steel, brass, copper, aluminium or gunmetal—-Oxy-Acetylene Welding will make it
strong as new for a trifle compared with the cost of replacement.
Ask us for particulars of " COMOX ” WELDING OUTFITS, or the address of
your nearest Oxy-Acetylene Welder.

What Delco- Light
means in your home
this Christmas
WHAT a hundred and one conveniences
Delco-Light brings to the home. It turns
gloom into brightness, drudgery into pleasure.
From daylight to dark it smoothes the way at
every turn, making life pleasanter for its use.
Is it breakfast ? Wfiile you eat your breakfast
food, the toast is turning a golden brown on
the electric grid before you, its appetising
odour making you hungrier every minute-
the kind of breakfast you enjoy !
Delco-Light lightens housework. It operates the
vacuum cleaner that cleans your carpets and curtains
—and does it with practically no effort on your part.
It operates the washing machine that cleans your
clothes, no more rubbing or scrubbing, just take
the clothes out of the machine when they are clean
and let the electric mangle squeeze the water out of
them. The electric iron completes the operation.
In the home, Delco-Light is a boon—on the farm
a bare necessity. It saves labour, time and money.
Fewer hands are needed—and those few are content-
ed because of the lightened labour that Delco-Light
makes possible. Above all Delco-Light brings the
convenience and comfort of electric light. No fumb-
ling with matches if you own Delco-Light—just turn
a button and the room is flooded with light, white
and plentiful.
Delco-Light is compactness itself and is extremely
simple and safe to operate —being almost human in
the way it looks after itself. The installation con-
sists of three elements: a kerosene engine that drives
a dynamo which generates electric current—these
two elements are direct-connected and form one
unit—and a battery that stores the electricity gen-
erated by the dynamo.
Delco- Light forms an investment worthy of your careful
investigation. It is economical in use. One quart of Kerosene
used in Delco-Light goes four times as far as when it is used
in an ordinary oil lamp, consequently Delco-Light soon pays
for itself. Not only does Delco-Light bring increased con-
venience and comfort to your home, but added economy and
safety as well. Call and have Delco-Light demonstrated to
you, or write for the Delco-Light Booklet.

NEW JERUSALEM AND A CORK-
SCREW.
A compromise between idealism and next
morning’s breakfast is the keynote of the
world’s -endeavor; and so, with his left eye
on the frying-pan and his right on a star,
man’s movement has made the watching
angels giddy. Idealism moves in a straight
line; but the chops and bacon are as elusive
as the coat-tails of a profiteer; and to keep
the one in sight while pursuing the other
round the corner is the soul-juggle we call
life. According to the religious text-book
which held all Europe in awe until Darwin
and Wallace got to grips with evolution,
the world began with two idealists in a
garden, and is to end with ten thousand times
ten thousand singing Hallelujah in a city ;
but the city is painted so like the garden
and so unlike any city yet constructed that
it seems to consist mainly of the old flower-
beds with the addition of a wall of precious
stones, gates of pearl and some special lime-
light effects and herbal remedies. The New
Jerusalem is, in fact, the restored Eden,
with special and perpetual holiday accom-
modation for all idealists who have fought
their breakfast needs to the last ditch with-
out losing sight of the star. Towards this
new and desirable garden-city the drums of
progress have been beating ever since the
first scribe set down words on a lily-leaf.
It was the thought behind Nebuchadnezzar’s
action when he put up the image of Baal-
Marduc, and to the sound of sackbut and
dulcimer called the earth to worship.
It was Alexander’s motive, too, in seek-
ing to conquer Asia. Between drinks, the
headlong boy, with the military genius of a
Foch and the enthusiasm of a Garibaldi,
dreamt of uniting Asia and Europe in a bond
of such productive sympathy that peace and
plenty would sing Hallelujah from India to
the Danube. Julius C.esar had the same
dream in better shape. Let Rome, nation
by nation, conquer the whole world and train
it to the Roman pattern, giving each State
the franchise as it was worthy to receive it,
and thus let the peace of utter justice and
the prosperity which justice brings spread
from the centre to the circumference! All
these attempts to reach the New Jerusalem
failed. Nebuchadnezzar went out and
ate grass like an ox in apparent disgust at
his futile efforts towards religious unity;
Alexander got too drunk to set a straight
course for his successors; Julius was inter-
rupted by a knife. Then the people with
curly thoughts took up the running again;
and the New Jerusalem floated off on a radi-
ant cloud.
* * * *
Among the world’s curves and eccentrics
it is necessary to distinguish two sorts.
There are people who think like a cork-
screw and twist backward that they may turn
forward, but who still stand for a sort of
advance ; there are people w r ho gently sway
around a small and staggering circle and
who stand for no sort of advance at all.
The most direct thinkers of all are those
who achieve an open spiral like that of a
corkscrew which has been pulled too long
and too hard: they keep the circular motion
but go forward more rapidly toward the
point. The world’s thought as a whole
strikes an average and keeps about the regu-
lation corkscrew shape. Thus, with a
League of Nations in being, James Smith
assures his brothers in the pub that war
will never come to an end ; yet Isaiaii in
700 b.c. prophesied an end of international
fighting and was echoed by Virgil in 30 b.c.,
re-echoed by John Bright in a.d. 1876, and
applauded by Woodrow Wilson in a.d.
1919. As war in its mechanical and useless
horror is ridiculous even in the eyes of
Smith himself, it would seem reasonable to
suppose that his mind is here on the back-
ward loop of the corkscrew; for that
Smith is not altogether unprogressive is
proved by the fact that his ideas on breeding
utility poultry are almost revolutionary.
And utility poultry must have a distinct
place in the New Jerusalem. Or take the
view of Henry Jones on the place of woman
in the social scheme. Henry is sure that
the home, particularly the kitchen, is her
proper sphere, and that whenever she seeks
self-expression or public position or anything
that looks like a man’s job she is an inter-
loper and a nuisance. Yet if Henry knew
anything beyond the gossip of his office and
the starting prices at the races, he should be
aware that Sappho held a top place in Greek
literature from the seventh century b.c.,
that Zenobia was the only person of either
sex who challenged the Roman Empire,
when at the zenith of its pride, to mortal
combat, that Joan of Arc was the only
military leader in six or seven centuries who
could in a wholesale and thoroughly effective
fashion thrash the English into hopeless aban-
donment of a pet and profitable scheme of
plunder, and that women are to-day holding
their own with men in most departments
of science, art and literature. Clearly
Jones is also on the backward twist of the
corkscrew, even though he has advanced
views in the matter of neckties; and neck-
ties may make nne small facet of the glory-
scheme of the New Jerusalem. On the
other hand, Edward Billings is a con-
fessed and devoted follower of Karl Marx
and doesn’t care who knows it; but his pri-
vate interests—the interests of the eye that
is on the frying-pan—are all in suburban
real estate. Evidently he is at the exact
point of the extended corkscrew where the
backward twist meets the elongated upward
curve; and while Karl Marx and the New
Jerusalem have long been associated, it is
unthinkable that the gates of pearl should
open upon rented terraces with fronts of
chrysolite and amethyst stucco. The world
is full of anarchistic supporters of mon-
archy, individualistic workers for the public
good, socialistic millionaires, militaristic
pacifists and soddenly-drunken prohibition-
ists ; and the corkscrew thought of the
units of society makes the corkscrew
thought of the world, which in its turn
makes for corkscrew progress towards the
New Jerusalem.
It wants a good deal of reading between
the lines of history to realise the nature
of the winding human journey. We have
suddenly advanced by mechanical and elec-
tric discoveries to the aeroplane and wire-
less ; but we do not know how the keystone
was lifted to the great arch at Baalbee or
by what mechanical devices the Egyptians
set up a stone like Cleopatra’s Needle. We
can build guns to fire a shell 40 miles; but
we do not know by what miracle of organisa-
tion Tirhakaii brought an army of 1,000,000
men across the Sinai Peninsula to argue
with Sennacherib about the possession of
Judaea. We can turn out a million news-
papers a day; but we cannot explain how
the intricacies of some very early book illu-
mination were done without a microscopic
lens. We can build steel-frame sky-
scrapers ; but we are left guessing hard how
the cathedrals of the Middle Ages were con-
structed without modern appliances by men
who slept on straw and had never thought
of a dinner fork. We acknowledge the
supremacy of Greek art and to a lesser extent
of Greek poetry ; but what about the earlier
Egyptian political economy which main-
tained the unity of a great nation in a small
land for at least 5000 years? The heirs of
the ages are apt to take a lot of their own
superiority for granted and to regard their
heirlooms as mere lumber; and as the
lumber becomes old it is forgotten until
someone re-discovers it and claims the dis-
covery as invention. Land theorists have
suggested many short-cuts to the New Jeru-
salem by modes of tenure and taxation ; but
they have not made much practical improve-
ment upon the system introduced by Wil-
liam I. after his slaughter of Harold at
Senlac: and William’s plan was a shoddy
one compared with the Qeltic scheme of re-
dividing all arable land every four years.
We have tried many schemes to improve
labor conditions, but none of them seem
better than the simple Aztec notion of giving
the worker a square deal but killing and
eating him if he loafed on his job. Simi-
larly, we have worked hard at devices to
ensure honest construction of buildings, but
we never thought of anything better than
the Babylonian law which made the con-
tractor perpetually responsible for the
safety of all who might pccupy the house.
If a brick fell from the chimney and killed
John Jobson, the contractor was held
guilty of murder; if it hit John Jobson,
junior, the contractor’s son had to pay the
penalty. So the whole family saw to it
that the bricks were properly laid. The for-
getfulness of succeeding ages sometimes gives
us a jolt of surprise. Irish geographers in
the sixth and seventh centuries taught the
sphericity of the globe, and one of them had
to explain the matter to the Pope; yet Colum-
bus did the explaining all over again and
wasn’t believed even after he had discovered
America. And side by side with these for-
gotten things stand those that all the world
remembers. The Israelites came out of the
wilderness into the Promised Land and out
of the Promised Land into a pawnshop. The
Roman Republic ended in an empire; the
Roman simplicity of life in dishes of night-
ingales’ tongues. The Greeks produced
Homer, Sappho, Sophocles, Socrates.
Plato and Demosthenes; they proceeded
to earn a reputation throughout Southern
Europe as liars; to-day they sell fish and
smell of oysters. Always the progress is
that of the corkscrew, though the point of
the instrument may be in the direction of
the holy human wine of the New Jerusalem.
« • « •
Puzzled by the curls, disappointed with
the twists and wholly despairing over past
failures, the builders of many religions gave
up the contemplation of a New Jerusalem
upon earth, and conveniently made it a place
of reward for the faithful after death. The
logic of the reasoning that, if the mind be
immortal (and it is difficult to see what sort
of immortality a soul can have without a
mind), the same corkscrew turnings must
persist in any possible future state was
brushed gently aside. Logic under the cir-
cumstances became heresy, and heretics were
liable to be either roasted or boiled; so
the person who thought there might be some
discords in the music of Heaven wisely said
nothing about it. Christianity in its earliest
form saw the New Jerusalem on earth ; but
by the time the Middle Ages had witnessed
a Christian knight converting the enemy
with a prickle-headed mace it was absolutely
necessary to transfer the visionary city to
other worlds. Nobody could believe it pos-
sible in Italy, France or Spain; and the
northern countries were a trifle worse. Eng-
land, it is true, had less bloodshed in her
own lanes and fields, but in that Merrie
Country the universal hope was obscured
by beef and beer; though the chalky shores
about Dover were New Jerusalem enough
to many a hunted person fleeing from wrath
of some Christian champion with a holy
license to murder. Yet the thought which
religion kept alive in an impracticable way
shone out anew with the coming of the age
of adventure. Columbus looked for the
city itself in the islands of the setting sun
he had discovered ; and El Dorado was on
the lips of every Devon sailor who fared
forth from Plymouth to hunt Dons to the
glory of God and plunder treasure ships for
conscience sake. Ideas of new and perfect
republics sizzled through all the 17th and
18th centuries ; and when at last the French
Revolution tore the gilded trappings from
a thousand shames, the hope of the New
Jerusalem rose as a great and flaming
beacon before the eyes of men. Get rid of
kings and kingly governments, and men
could lead the perfect life. Then the cork-
screw turned, and over the graves of dead
kings rose other kings with others behind
them —an infinity of kings, mostly crowned
with red tape, but each very despotic in his
own sphere. Yet the hope remained. Men
started international exhibitions as porches
for the nearly gates, and a Palace of Peace
at the Hague as a formal acknowledgment
that something ought to be done. Then
1914 blew up with the loudest report over
heard on earth; and 1918 saw the New
Jerusalem coming at express speed bv wav
of Paris and Geneva. At the end of 1920
the corkscrew has made another half-turn,
and now nobody can get even a glimpse of
the jasper wall.
Yet the New Jerusalem, in all the things
that really matter, is a practical enough
proposition. It simply means a world at
peace singing the Hallelujah of definite pro-
gress because at last all men have a straight
thought. That universal straight thought
may be much nearer than it seems. A
wandering meteorite in space is attracted
hither and thither by every pull of gravity
from a body bigger than itself. It moves
in curves and twists, makes corkscrew paths
of flame in the void, and turns a thousand
times like a hunted hare; but once it comes
within the full attraction of the sun it
rushes in a line as straight as any Euclid
could draw to its goal. The same is the
case in all departments of human know-
ledge and endeavor. Science groped for 25
centuries around the idea of evolution, came
near to it, darted away from it, spun round
it—then Darwin published the “Origin of
Species.” Within 20 years it was used to
explain every phenomenon of life. Or take
the history of the aeroplane. D.edalus
made wings and flew across Grecian myth ;
the next ten or a dozen centuries said it
couldn’t be done; a machine glided without
mechanical power, but on the modern prin-
ciple, in the time of Nero ; the next 12
or 13 centuries would probably have con-
sidered it a heresy to try to fly; in Italy
of the renaissance an almost practical
scheme of flight was thought out; the suc-
ceeding ages mocked the very idea ; the be-
ginning of the 19th century saw the balloon
and felt its wings growing; the middle and
end of the same century proved with great
scientific learning that a heavier-than-air
machine was impossible; then an experi-
ment or two proved it possible in spite of
the weight of the recent argument. From
that hour the aeroplane came with a rush;
and in 20 years from its practical start it
had crossed the Atlantic and made a journey
from England to Australia. The history
of every movement of thought and inven-
tion is much the same: the course is long
and winding, but there is a very quick run
up the straight.
The original New Jerusalem, wearing no
alias, was a dream of Christian Jewish
exiles who had seen or known of the smash-
ing of the old city by Titus ; and who, scat-
tered about among the Ilellenised splendors
of Asia Minor, could not long for a restora-
tion of Zion and a rebuilding of the temple
on Moriah, but saw the sequel and fulfilment
of all the old decayed things in the practical
new. The way in which they saw it was
as variable as the type of mind possessing
the vision; for variety-in-uniformity is a
characteristic of mental progress which gives
the color and music to life. All men with
unwithered souls love the beauty of woman-
hood ; but each man picks a different girl
and, if he has luck, finds her fairest among
women. Yet to each will come with the
same soul-stirring the word or line that sets
the worship of the universal Helen or the
eternal Eve to a fine heart-music. New
Jerusalem had, and still has, great variety
in its shape and color; that is why it was
represented with so many gates, though all
the gates were of pearl. But the Christian
of Ephesus and Philadelphia had long ago
absorbed an idea that lay behind all vision
and gave its vital force to all conjecture.
The Master from Nazareth had declared
that “the Kingdom of Heaven is within
you.” On the philosophic soundness of that
theory all the rest was built: and around it
the corkscrew twists most vigorously. Just
before dinner the New Jerusalem may easily
appear to consist of roast beef, while on the
fringe of the Never-Never it becomes an
artesian bore; but very early on a Spring
morning it is a music of birds, a flame of
wattle, a breath of delicious sweetness and
a great vague hope of a general arrangement
of things to match the morning’s glory. The
trouble with most modern New Jerusalem
hunters is that they mj_ss the significance
of the inward view. On the map Australia
is a large continent divided by regular and
irregular lines and surrounded by sea and
printed names. In general experience it is
a series of immense distances, which, taken
in detail, consist mostly of ants, eucalyptus
foliage, sheep, cattle, wire fences, pubs,
occasional homesteads and still more occa-
sional cultivation. Yet Australia to the
individual citizen is really a little nerve-
movement of the brain. All the Australia
he can ever know or possess is carried about
with him under his hat; and what he makes
of Australia is at the last analysis an affair
between his imagination and his will. What
is true of the relation of a citizen to his
country is true also of his relation to the
world and to all progress and world reform ;
it is a matter of internal reconstruction.
Make the man’s mental attitude right and all
the rest is right.
* * * *
So the New Jerusalem is probably much
nearer than Bolshevism and the Stock Ex-
change and strikes and the cost of living and
the divorce courts and prohibitionists and
boy scouts and W. M. Hughes might lead
us to suppose ; and a very few years hence
people may marvel that it didn’t come sooner.
Looking fairly at Australia, it seems little
less than a miracle that things can be as
they are at present. A wide, rich continent
with infinite variety of climate and soil grows
everything that man can require in such
abundance that life should long ago have
reached a stage at which the woes that older
nations endured would have utterly passed
away. Yet the thief, the murderer, the
hungry child and the grossest ignorance and
superstition remain features of our land-
scape ; while petty tyranny walks everywhere
in red tape, and bigger tyranny uses old
political forms and War Precautions to make
democracy a mockery and freedom a mere
catchword in the mouths of those who hate
it. Yet in 1900 we saw the New Jerusalem
so near that it seemed almost impossible
that we should be side-tracked from the
vision. The national corkscrew has twisted
a great deal since then; but it is much to be
questioned whether the view of Australians
has really shifted or whether the twisting
and turning is confined to politicians. Cer-
tainly no corkscrew ever invented performed
in the fashion of the alleged leaders of Aus-
tralian democracy. For years most of them
appear to have been whirling on their mental
ears and cavorting on their intellectual noses
in a fashion to make an Anabaptist wind-
mill giddy. Both their administration
and the Statute Book reflect this convulsive
effort, and the result is a variety of politics
as closely curled as parsley and about as
effective as a dynamic force. But over the
twists and turns Australia is probably look-
ing in a very slightly curved line towards a
real goal. The supposed obstacles are in the
eyes of the sincere watcher slight enough.
The struggle between Capital and Labor does
not look fundamental when it is remembered
that all capital in a country like this is re-
made every five years; the high cost of
living can hardly be serious with all the
empty miles of land waiting to grow all that
can be required; the international troubles
half a world away can have little enough
effect if Australia is true to Australia. The
New Jerusalem is, in plain fact, just beyond
our sunset; and the way to it is barred by
nothing more formidable than want of system.
In plainest terms of real economics the New
Jerusalem is the city of Enough-to-go-Round
and stands by the harbor of Fair Deal.
AVithout any government at all Australia
would probably be quite a decent place to
live in ; with a government possessing some
straightness of vision the holy city would leap
upon us in a hop-skip-and-jump. But man-
kind can sometimes progress in spite of its
Governments ; and the individual is a tremen-
dous force when there are enough of him.
AA r hat we need most is a national conscience,
a religion of faith in our country that would
make every action sacramental. If we milked
every cow to the glory of Australia, turned
every spadeful of earth to the hope of the
future, yarded every sheep with the idea that
its fleece had a holy patriotic meaning, sold
every yard of cloth as an act of Australian
piety and made the work of every day a
solid Hallelujah, the vision of the ages would
become a sudden actuality.


Saddle and Spur.
CHANT OF THE HORSEMEN.
[For Tiie Bulletin,J
Over the hills and the valleys of gold,
Swift as the wind when the morning awakes,
Trampling the bracken with light step and bold,
Bursting with joy through the breaks!
Saddle and stirrup and spur,
Clink of the bridle and bit,
Soft where the gum-branches stir,
Swift where the bush-breezes flit—
Hear the light hearts of the horsemen go,
Blue skies above, and brown earth below!
Down where the ferns are dripping with dew,
Down where the rills are rippling and sweet,
High where the tree-tops reach to the blue,
Sweeping with swift leaping feet!
Song of the stirrup and spur,
Clink of the bridle and bit,
Soft where the wattle-boughs stir,
Swift where the bush-breezes flit—
Hear the light hearts of the horsemen go,
Blue skies above, and brown earth below!
Into the heart of the red-gold skies,
Bathed in the glow of the deathless fire,
Riding with hope in their deathless eyes
To the land of dear Desire!
And the song of stirrup and spur,
And the clink of bridle and bit,
Swell high where the gum-branches stir,
Sweep on where the bush-breezes flit.
Oh, hear the brave hearts of the horsemen go,
Red skies above, and dim earth below !

“II.O.”: In Colombo I was told a yarn
which quaintly illustrates the workings of
the mind of our chocolate brother. Chunder
Loo accused another whose name wasn’t
Butta Singh of having abducted his (Clnin-
der’s) spouse. The evidence given for the
prosecution before a white magistrate was
that the nigger whose name wasn’t Singh
had called at the house in Loo’s absence
and, with the assistance of two male rela-
tives, had bound the ankles and wrists of
Mrs. Loo, gagged her and carried her off.
An imposing array of witnesses was in court
to swear that the facts were as stated. The
defence (supported by a large army of dis-
interested witnesses) was that Loo had
been in the habit of correcting his wife with
a bamboo, and she, having learned to loathe
and despise him, had flown to the bosom of
his rival of her own free will. The Court
adjourned the case for further inquiries, as
a result of which it was ascertained: (a)
nobody had been abducted, (7i) the wife of
Chunder’s bosom had been dead for seven
years. The whole affair was the outcome
of a long-established feud, and doubtless, as
a side issue, the parties derived a certain
amount of innocent amusement from pulling
the leg of the white man’s Justice.

“Rooinek” : A long team of bullocks was
sprawling and straggling over the Tas-
manian cross-roads, and I had to stop my
motor-bike to let the prehistoric outfit go
past with its logs. As I waited there came
the unfamiliar drone of an aeroplane, and
the majestic machine sailed overhead, in
search of a missing comrade. Bullocky
slouched along, taking no notice, so I
whistled to him and pointed aloft. He gave
a casual glance upward ; then it was “Gee,
Strawberry,” and on he plodded, indifferent
to everything but the lumbering animals he
was driving. “Stolid as his own bullocks,” I
thought, and went on, reflecting on this con-
junction of the most ancient and most modern
means of transport, and on the strange lack
of imagination of a bucolic mind that could
see nothing in it worth looking at. Later on,
when I found that that bullocky had put in
four solid years on the Western Front, I
went out and kicked myself.

“Deep Sinkin’ ”: Sam Irvine, the motor-
driver between Ivingoonya, on the East-West
line (S.A.), and the Stuart Ranges opal
fields in Centralia, was camped one night at
Mt. Eba station, halfway along the run.
Flies were bad, and the party were all hav-

“Walilia”: The cook-boy of Papua is a
cheerful rascal, but without him the lot of
the pioneer white man would be much worse
than it is. There is the charm of expectancy,
of surprises to come, for you never know
what weird and strange thing your boy will
do next. Nothing is too unconventional for
the son of a primitive people; for, be it

the advent of Law and Order in the Delta
region a decade or so back, an enthusiastic
hunter and eater of man. Hobson’s bride, a
sweet young girl from a suburb of Sydney,
nearly died of fright the morning she heard
strange rumblings in the oven, and opened
the door to discover six feet of angry carpet-
snake doing a jazz on the tray. “You no

worked for a man who was a lover of curry.
One evening the dish appeared to have
changed its color, and as for its flavor !
“Mero [boy] !” yelled the victim, after his
first mouthful, “what the deuce have you
done to the curry?” “He nice one,” said
the boy; “plenty onion, plenty bulumacow

To clean the silver with knife-powder is a
favorite outburst of the cheerful young ras-
cals ; but the lad who put a liberal allow-
ance of glue into the starch with which he
was laundering his master’s duck clothes
invented a new torture. Hearing a sound
of hammering in his kitchen one afternoon,
the boss strolled out to inquire. Ranged
along the wall stood several pairs of trou-
sers, beautifully ironed, while the boy with
the aid of a hammer was folding another
pair on the table.

“Ewa”: I told a suburban manager the
yarn about W. S. Percy thinking he had
made a hit with the Mackay
cock i e s when all their
applause was for the rain
that beat on the iron roof.
“I’ll never forget the night
we played at Dead Dog,” lie
said. “There was a big
storm-scene, and if some of
us weren't actors, by h—l
we could ‘storm.’ I had a
sheet of iron for the
thunder-claps, the comedian
worked the lightning (the
only thing he ever did well), and the rest of
us howled like the wind. It was so realistic
that the entire audience got up and bolted
for the door.” He finished his drink. “Yes.”
he sighed, “she had a line of clothes out and
didn’t want to get ’em wet.”
“Deirdre”': Something had gone wrong,
and when the up-passenger crawled into
Here-I-Am it was held for an hour and a
half to allow the down-mail to pass. There
being time for a drink, the usual Marathon
started for Thompson’s pub just across the
line. The bar was quickly filled with a
writhing, jostling crowd. With arms work-
ing like piston-rods the barman sent an
endless string of “pots” tangoing in and
out of the crowd; now full, now empty, dodg-
ing a curse here and leaping an upraised
arm there. A fellow with a dilapidated uni-
form flapping around him twiddled two flags,
red and green, among his fingers, and occa-
sionally poked his dial into the bar. “That’s
it. boys,” he said cordially. “Plenty of time
yet. Enjoy yourselves —that’s what I say.”
They immediately accepted the guard as a
genius: he rejuvenated their thirsts, at all
events. The beer was running a banker
when a passenger across the station started
to whistle frenziedly. They looked appeal-
ingly at the guard. He hesitated, wavered.
“Righto, a quarter-’f-’n-hour more. boys.
Enjoy yourselves, that’s what I say.” And
a wav went the “pots” on another tango.
Suddenly there was a flutter in the pub. A
little fellow struggled into the bar, his leap-
ing eyes dragging him behind them. “She’s
gone !” he croaked. “The train’s gone !” The
incredulous roysterers made for the veran-
dah, carefully dodging imaginary chairs and
tables on the way. “Heigh!” bawled the
foremost as he bumped against the lounger
beside the post—“where’s that guard?”
“Who?” “The guard—the bloke with the
flags.” “Him !” snarled the lounger. “He’s
no guard. He’s the cove wot keeps the pub!”
“Hamer”: There was always a certain
amount of trouble with Smithers after a
night with his friends. In his sozzled state
he used to imagine that everybody was
drunk except himself, and that it was a high
moral duty to see his friends home. Con-
sequently unless those who knew his cheer-
ful illusion saw him well on the homeward
track, those who didn’t might And them-
selves burdened towards midnight with
a friendly but inebriated Smitliers, who
would persist in confiding to porters
and policemen that his friends were
hopelessly drunk, but he would look
after them. And when they reached
their destination it was on the cards that
he would assure them that they were mak-
ing a mistake, and try to drag them away
from their own mansions. What made his
habits more unholy was that he lived up the
mountains, and his last train departed early.
That meant that if Smithers was allowed
to see anyone home he had to be asked to
stay the night, and hence he became un-
popular with respectable matrons. The
crisis arrived last Christmas. His friends
noticed Smithers dozing over his whisky
and, mindful that his train was due to leave
shortly, decided to run him up to the sta-
tion. He sleepily objected, but Smith
whispered that Brown was blithered, a lie
which appealed to his protective instincts.
In the tram Smithers went to sleep; and,
when the station was reached, his friends
rushed him to his train, which was on the
point of leaving. “This isn’t Brown’s
train!” protested Smithers. “No; it’s
yours!” he was told. He wanted to argue,
and even mentioned fight; but with the
assistance of a porter who recognised him
he was heaved into a carriage and the door
was locked. As the train moved out he
appeared at the window, shouting. He
seemed quite angry. But his friends, with
the sense of good work accomplished, re-
turned to town and met Cummings, to whom
they confided that they had been sending
Smithers home. “Smithers!” he exclaimed.
“Sent him up the mountains? Why, he
moved down to Manly last week!”

The bright young man doing the shows
for a Melbourne paper was held up in the
vestibule of the premises by a black-jowled
actor, who shook him warmly by the hand.
“I am told you are Humph, of the Eh
Wiiat." said he, “and I am very glad to see
you. My name is Blink. That was a gor-
geous notice you gave my Dan'l Jakes when
I was with the Blank Company—splendid !
I have always thought I would like to bestow
some mark of my esteem on the writer of
that notice. Here, sir. Nay. take it: take
it, I insist.” The mark of his regard was
a single collar-stud. “It is a poor thing
enough, but mine own, and a diamond, I
assure you. And now we will have the
drinks.” The journalist found the stud to
be of the sort you buy at the rate of four-
pence a peck. The drinks were tenpenny
ones. The journalist paid for the drinks.
“Bad Australian”: Ilourigan and Flynn
were men of very decided opinions and
aggressively independent. They were neigh-
bors and always at bitter variance. One day
at the periodical cattle sale Hourigan was
roosting on the top rail of one of the pens,
with Flynn sitting in opposition. Without
warning Flynn toppled over and landed in
the drafting yard, where he was immediately
tackled by a long-horned, wild-eyed Queens-
land gully-raker, which kept him circulating
with such velocity that he hadn’t a chance
of regaining his perch on the top rail or
nipping through the fence to safety. As he
hurtled around the yard on the seventeenth
lap. all out. his breath coming in short,
choking gasps, Hourigan repented him of his
unneighborly feelings and called out, “Hoy,
there, Flynn ! Tell me, will I be openin’ tn’
gate for yeh?” Without neglecting the busi-
ness in hand Flynn replied in a series of
spasmodic grunts : “Yeh —will —do—phwat
plazes—yeh—besht—liourigan—me—mahn.”
But as he came around towards Hourigan
again he added : “At —the —same —toime I
—don’t moind —tellin’—yeh—that—this—

Italian opera singers have no conspicu-
ous sense of humor. This is particularly
true of sopranos. Better tickle a frog with
a feather to produce a guffaw than waste
two days trying to expound a joke to a
Roman soprqpo. Some years ago the lead-
ing sop. with, a big opera co. in Australia
was fatter than ever. Everybody who saw
her admitted the appositeness of the inter-
jection when a gallery-boy set the gibe cur-
rent with “Now, George Reid, what’s the
use of pretending—we all' know you!”
After that the lady got “George Reid” at
least once an evening, and at length she
went to the eo.’s press representative with
"Shorge Reit! Shorge Reit! Who issa ze
Shorge Reit?” An opportunity came at the
races, and Signora was presented to George
Reid. She was still perplexed, and drew a.
friend aside. “But I notta understandit,”
she said. “Vy zey calla Shorge Reit to

O’Neill, Police Magistrate, was on the
bench at Ilillston (N.S.W.), when an
elderly man named Fyfe was docked for
liquoring over-much the night before. “What
have you to say?” queried the P.M. Fyfe
puckered up his lips and poked out his
stubble-covered chin, but otherwise gave no
response. “Wish to call any witnesses?”
was the next question, and it brought the
same “reply.” “You’re the first mute fife
I’ve come across,” said old O’Neill. “But
I’ll try to knock a note out of you. You’re

“Coober Pedy”: The casual Aussie up
Far North thinks in eternity rather than in
time. I met an old battler recently from
the Finke River district. “When’s the rail-
way coming through from Oodnadatta,
Jack?” I asked him. “Damned if I know,”
Jack replied. “They’re spending fortunes
on surveys. Why, bless yer. man, they talk
o’ putting a bridge over the Finke. D’y’ever
hear of such waste? She’s dry most of the
year. All they gotta do is to run the rails
straight across the river-bed at a good cross-
ing.” “What about when the river comes
down?” I asked him —“wouldn’t the rails
get all silted up, and wouldn’t the train be
held up?” “Oh. yes,” says Jack, “but she
wouldn’t be held up long. I’ve seen the
Finke go down in three days. And even in
the worst floods she wouldn’t be held up
inore’n a week. But no—these flash survey-
blokes gotta have a bridge.”

The only time George Rignold ever went
to the smaller towns in Victoria he played
his justly-celebrated “Henry V.” in Warr-
nambool for two nights. It went greatly
against the grain of Handsome George to
do the semi-smalls, but he had been guaran-
teed good audiences in three places, and it
was a time when money was much in demand.
After the first performance in the great
spud centre George was introduced to a local
nabob who shook him warmly by the hand,
clapped him on the back, and said: “You
done it well, my boy—you done it very well.
Keep at it, keep at it. We’ll be seein’ you

With knees updrawn and elbows overhead.
Her slim young body forms a crescent fair,
Its whiteness gleaming through her tumbled hair.
Proud Venus trembles and with envy sees
The goddess-girl float silverly at ease.

Eager to gain the cloud on which she lies.

Leansi through the dark to soothe a frightened child.

THE REVOLT OF BINES.
[For Tiie Bulletin.]
Sam Binks was in for Dust-anil-dry!
The fight at last was done,
And he bad been elected by
A margin of just one.
He grasped each voter by the hand
And beamed on all, for he
Knew not which out of all the band
Was his majority.
Ere many days he ceased to grin,
His face grew long and stern —
Dave Johnson’s cows were grazing in
Sam’s paddock of lucerne.
He couldn’t have a row with Dave,
For Dave had let him see
That he must with respect behave
To the majority.
Then young John Jenks Sam’s daughter wooed.
Oh, how Binks hated John!
A few months back he’d have been rude,
But now his pluck was gone;
For plain his daughter spoke her mind
(A voter —twenty-three) :
“If you forbid the banns you’ll find
You’ve no majority!”
Next, Andy Dawson stole Sam’s calf,
And Snooks would pay no rent;
And Ikey Moses wanted half
Of Sam’s emolument.
Sain didn’t swear or make a fuss;
He had no remedy.
The spongers plainly said: “It’s us
Is your majority.”
So things went on from bad to worse,
As crayfish do, and corns.
Some hand was always in Sam’s purse;
His rose was mostly thorns!
At last he turned in wrath, did Sam,
And said (his blasphemy
Must be toned down) : “Confound and damn
The dashed majority!”
He freed his mind from cares of State,
His kindness turned to spite.
He started out to clean the slate,
And, Lord! how he could fight!
Black eyes and bleeding noses none
Escaped who’d claimed to be
In his submissive period one
Of his majority.
The member now for Dust-and-dry _
Is old, and bent, and thin.
Those are the three great reasons why
The voters put him in.
No thought gave they to politics ;
Each said, “No, not for me
A representative who licks
His whole majority!”

“Silas Snell”: Night shift on the Swallow,
and towards daylight, with the birds moving rest-
lessly in the trees, Darby, the braceman, drowsed
on the pile of reef at the mouth of the shaft. The
whip-boy had gone to sleep on a few chaff-bags, and
the whip horse, loosed from his labor for the time
being, was munching with his nose buried in a gin-
case close by, where the tip sprawled down the hill-
side. At this moment Mrs. Jim Much came racing
down through the bush in a costume of something
white hastily assumed. Mrs. Much
was celebrated in and about Petti-
coat for her utter devotion to her
husband, just as Much was for
his blazing jealousy and his em-
phatic manner of dealing with the
young missus when occasion
seemed to demand it, the occasion
being usually made plain to

beer. Mrs. Much ran on to

the shaft. “Where is he?” she cried in a frenzy.
“Where’s Jimmie? Oh, he’s hurt —he’s hurt, and you
won't tell me! I knew it, I knew it —I had a
terrible dream. Oh, my Jimmie —my poor Jimmie!”
Darby, suddenly awakened, and not yet quite aware
of the significance of the demonstration, was trying
to say that Much was below, and enjoying his cus-
tomary health; but Mrs. Much, full of her wild idea,
was still crying out: “I dreamed it. I saw' it all.
Oh, he is killed!” At this moment little Mrs. Much
received so violent a kick from the rear that she
was precipitated head foremost down the tip, and
went rolling and clawing in the broken reef. At
last she stopped and sat up. “Oh, thank God, thank
God, he is well!” she said. She had mistaken the>
hoof of the whip-horse for Jimmie’s.

“Harvib” : Drovers could never induce old
Tighten, of Woolaway, to accept a phone notice
for travelling stock, though the homestead was 20
miles from the western boundary-gate. It was
Howell’s weak plant that decided him to chance
it without the necessary report, and move his few
woollies across the run. An abusive owner dis-
covered the travellers on dinner-camp the second
day. “I’ll meet you meself next time,” he roared,
as he rode away; “an’ if ever you come on again
with anything, an’ don't give notice, I’ll summons
you!” Three weeks later Howell reported Woolaway
for 80 head, to enter at the western boundary, and
Tighten jogged out to meet them at the gate.
“Where’s your 80 head?” he snapped, as Howell
drove up with a loaded waggonette. The drover
glanced about the conveyance. “They’re all with
me so far, thank you, sir!” he replied. Howell
had been to a clearing sale, and the - carefully-
packed crates contained 40 pairs of leghorns.

“Ragar”: We had a dispute in camp as to
which could be heard furthest, the cow-bell or the
conch-shell. I backed the conch. The bells, which
included “bull-frogs” and “castlereaghs,” are all
right for the purpose they are made for, but if the
conditions are equally unfavorable to both the shell
has it all the time. We tried it across the surf.
The apostle of the bells did his darnedest, Standing
on the beach beside me. He worked the bells and
I blew the conch, while the judges were out in a
boat, pulling away from the shore. They signalled
back when they lost the sound of the bells, then
continued pulling out, to get the distance the conch
would travel. 1 kept on blowing at intervals, and
the boat kept on its way to the horizon. When
the crew returned next day they swore that they
had got tired of pulling, and guessed the shell
could be heard over in South America. The bell-
man said that, anyway, the blanky cows couldn’t
blow conch-shells, so what was the good ?

“Scottie Thrake” : “Spider,” an old identity
of Rishton and Rochford (N.Q.), who used to earn
a living by catching and selling fish, found a barrel
of beer in the river. It was firmly embedded in the
sand in the shade of the ti-trees on the down-stream
side of one of the little islands, and was covered
by about a foot of water. After sounding it care-
fully “Spider” decided that it was beer and part
of a lot of goods that had been washed away in a
flood eight years before. After a world of labor and
trouble he managed to get part of the barrel above
the water and work a sheath-knife between the staves.
It was beer all right and in good condition, with
a fine mellow flavor and as cold as ice. When that
king spree was over “Spider” went poking along
the sandbars with a rod of drill steel, and at a
depth of about sft., behind one of the higher
islands, he struck oil. He and his friends shifted
about 150 tons of white, seeping driftsand —and un-
earthed a box of soap.
“Sir Spen” : McDonald had seen ducks in
thousands; Smith had seen them in millions ; Geary
had seen them turn day into night by blotting out
the sun. Then Harry Scott had a go. “We wus
camped on the Maria River,” he began, “nettin’
fish. Useter always ’aul at ’igh-tide. Mate ’n’ I
got on the shick once, ’n’ didn’t reach camp tiHl
the day before the boat wuster call ’n’ stow our
catch. Willin’ ter do overtime norder ter make!
up fer what we ’ad lorst, we wus goin’ ter play
’ell that night. Waited fer the tide ter rise, but;,
dinky-di, she never riz a hineh.” Harry yawned,
filled his pipe, and was silent. “But what went
wrong with the tide?” asked someone. “Nothin’
much,” drawled Harry, “ ’cept a mob er ducks
’eadin agin ’er ’ad pushed ’er back.”
“Mick the Preacher”: It is a most un-
pleasant duty to be the bearer of the news of the
death of a relative, especially if it be the person’s
parent and the death has been sudden; neverthe-
less, it has to be done. And so on the night of the first
Tuesday in November, in the year that Gincase
won the Melbourne Cup, when old Bill Faraway
slipped from his chair and had to be carried to
bed to die a few hours later, it fell to his son Tom
to ride 12 miles down the river to inform his sister
Maggie of the calamity that had befallen the
family. It was a lonely ride, the only merit about
it being that it gave Tom plenty of opportunity
to think over ways of breaking the news —only to
be forced to the conclusion that nothing could dis-
guise the shocking nature of what he had to tell.
Maggie was married to Tim Puller —a one-time
jockey, but now a part of the backbone of the
country. It happened that he was feeding the pigs
when Tom arrived at 8 a.in. “Hullo, Tom!” Tim
shouted as the news-bearer came through the gate
about a hundred yards away. “How’re yer gettin’
on?” “Aw, orright,” Tom shouted back. “How’s
yerself?” Tim reckoned that he was Al, and as
Tom arrived at the pigsty Tim asked him to guess
EXCESSIVE PARENTHOOD.
MARY: “What name that new feller?"
BILL: "Oh, him? That's the priest."
MARY: "By cripes, he got plenty piccaninnies—everybody call him ‘Forder.' ”
what won the Cup. At the mention of the Cup Tom
became excited and guessed that Roman Nose had
won. Tim denied it, so Tom guessed Orange Pip
and various others ; but as none of those had passed
the post first he gave up guessing and excitedly asked
Tim what did win. “Why, little Gincase, of course,”
Tim answered, and he burst into a roar of laughter
as though it were the greatest joke ever heard.
Tom couldn’t believe it, and mentioned something
about Hell. Being, how'ever, assured by Tim that
Gincase had done it all right, Tom remarked that
if a feller’d on’y ltnowed he could ha’ won a
hundred off Toby Nolan, the bookie. “I heard him
a month ago wantin’ to lay a hundred to one ag’in
Gincase,” Tom reflected sadly. So they talked race-
horses for more than an hour. They then talked
bullocks for two hours, and had just got back
on Gincase again when Maggie came out on the
verandah and asked them if they didn’t think it
was time they had some dinner. As they w'ent in
and sat down Maggie came from the kitchen, shook
hands with Tom and asked him how he "’as getting
on. Tom reckoned he was orright. “And how are
they keeping at home?” Maggie inquired. “Oh,
pretty good,” said Tom —“ ’cept the ole man: he shet
his knife last night.”
“Baree”: Long before the first white
union arrived in Darwin the blacks had a union
at the West Arm tinfield. Big Billy instigated it.
The terms under which blacks w'ere then employed
included a seven-day W'eek, two bob a W'eek in money,
and damper for every meal. One day Big Billy blew
in, and strolled round the claims asking questions
of the white men. Possibly some of them pulled
his leg a bit, for the next day all black workers had
vanished. Then Big Billy presented his ultimatum:
No Sunday work, one tin of “bully” per day per
worker, food for lubras and piccaninnies, and fi’
bob per week in silver. “Allabout blackboy silly
fellow,” said Billy. “No more savvy anysing. I
bin makum one-feller onion longa boy. ’Spose
you no pay, can’t get boy. Allabout boy longa onion
now.” So we gave in to the “onion” delegate. He
had the whiphand, for those niggers never needed
to work. Later, when one day I tried to pay a
nigger with threepenny-bits there were ructions. “No
good, boss, no good. That one silver altogether too
much big feller little feller. You give it shillin’.”

“Bill True”: Some dogs are born clever.
My black dog, Snowy, is one of them. He developed
the habit of sleeping on my bed, and catching him
in the act I give him a hiding. Going into my room
the other day I could see by the impression that
he had been lying on it again, so Snowy got another
hiding. Three days ago he was too quick for me,
but I caught him standing on his hind legs straight-
ening out the quilt. However, the warmth of the
bed was sufficient evidence, so further chastisement
followed. Yesterday I caught the scoundrel stand-
ing on the bed and blowing on the quilt. I went
out and bought him some bones.

“Jimsey”: I recently ran across an old
droving hate of mine and ’tween drinks asked him
about a mutual friend. “Oh, he slipped his hobbles
about a year back.” It was a new bit of the bush
to me.
“Billy T.” : Johnson, of Greenleaf, had a
favorite black boy at his homestead, one to whom
he allowed many liberties in return for faithful ser-
vice. When Johnson married a second time and
brought home, in addition to the new wife, a large
mother-in-law, always touched with asperity, Jacky’s
amazement was profound. He could not for the
life of him understand why Johnson did not take
a club to the lady who was so continuously nagging
at him. Johnson would come from the house, obvi-
ously ruffled, pursued by angry yelps, and Jacky
always offered the same advice: “Knock it that one
on the head. Jacky knock it him on the plurry
head plurry quick, my word!” Johnson once went to
some trouble to explain that the lady was his mother-
in-law. “A man has to put up with something from
his mother-in-law,” Johnson said. One day there
arose a great hullabaloo in the front garden, and
Johnson rounded the house .just in time to see Jacky
revolve off the verandah and land on his head in
a flowerbed, while the heel of the skirt of Mrs.
Johnson’s mother disappeared into the hall. Jacky
sat up in the dust and rubbed himself. “What hap-
pened, Jacky?” asked Johnson. Jacky put up a
yowl, and pointing to the house, said: “By cripes,
boss, I bin find out that plurry feller Jaeky's plurry
murrer-in-law, too!”
“Edclyson” : “It’ll be all fair, square and
above board, or not at all,” said Hines. “I’ll put it
to the man reasonable. He don’t want his wife, he
can’t get on with her, ’ceptin’ by leadin’ a cat-and-
dorg life, whereas she and me could hit it off all
right, bein’ in a manner iv speakin’ made for one
another. There ain’t nothin’ under’and about Harry
Hines. I’ll put it to him like this. ‘You two arc
alwuz a-fightin’ and a-scrappin’,’ I’ll say, ‘makin’
each other’s lives a misery. Where’s the sense iv
it all, when all yiv gotter do is ’and the lady over

cerned ?’ If he won’t come at that, I’m willin ’to
throw in my big grey draught ’orse, ’n’ p’raps a quid
or two if Patterson stands out fer all he kin get.
I’m goin’ up to him right away to settle this matter
here ’n’ now.” We met Harry on his way home
after his interview with Patterson. There was no
need to ask how his bargain had prospered. He
bad Mrs. Patterson on his arm, and he was leading
Patterson’s big roan mare.

“Glug”: We were leaning over the rail
watching the sheep-dog trials and discussing the
different methods of training dogs, when Hay-
whiskers chipped in to put us right. “It’s no use
tryin’ to teach a dog this work,” he said —“it’s born
in them. Once I was shiftin’ some ewes in the
middle of the lambin’ season, and my old bitch
Nancy was just about ready to pup, so we were
talcin’ it easy. Durin’ the pause at midday one
old ewe made for the bushes. Nance went after her,
so I didn’t worry. Half an hour later Nance came
back with the ewe, and, s’elpme, a few yards behind
came a brand-new pup chivin’ two new lambs.” He
told us the next one at the counter.
“How’s This” : Two fencers on Liverpool
Plains could not find enough wood to boil the billy.
A thought struck Bill to light the grass. He did
it, and as the fire started to run he walked on hold-
ing the billy over the flame. He walked four miles
before the billy boiled. Then he found he’d forgotten
the tea.
“Lofty”: Dad and mum were amongst
the first-fleeters to the Pioneer River (Q-) > and tooK
up a patch with a water frontage. Mum was up
earlier than usual in the half-light to get Bad a

BED’S VICTORY.
[Fou The Bulletin.]
Hark to the triumph of Brown!
Brown the poor clerk and the sloth
Always was late into town,
Since to leave bed he was loth ;
Blankets, the white arms of sheets,
Pillows with cheeks smooth and soft —
These had bewitched him too oft
With their unholy deceits.
When the sun rose to his work
Brown would still linger and snore,
Chuckle and snuggle and shirk,
Dawdle on Slumber-land’s shore;
Thus was he found on the morn
Gabriel, rising at eight,
Sounded the Trumpet of Fate,
Blew on the great Judgment Horn.
Gabriel challenged the sky
With the fierce blast of his breath.
Down fell the stars from on high
Black as the shadow of death ;
Round tied the moon and the sun,
All the winds shrieked and were lost;
Oceans and mountains were tossed
Hopelessly mixed into one.
Cities and nations like smoke
Panted a minute and ceased;
From rotted coffins Things broke
Fearful at being released ;
Out of the sea the wet dead
Rose to the surface and wept.
Peacefully Brown turned and slept
In the warm arms of his bed.
The earth was a handful of dust
Flung from the great cleaning out;
Gone were the damned and the just.
Sinners and people devout;
Nothing remained save old Brown,
Splendid at last in his sleep,
Snoring with breath slow and deep
Under his snug eiderdown.
Gabriel, weary at length,
Felt a last bray would be wise,
Puffed with the end of his strength,
Bidding the last man arise.
Brown turned his head on his arm,
Snuggled down deeper and snored,
Murmuring, distant and bored,
“Damn it, there goes the alarm!”

“Eddyson”: One of the most gruesome
stories in the unwritten history of Vic. mining is of
the crime of Donald Scott. Donald had been a
faceman in one of the old Sebastopol mines where
the patches, if infrequent, were very rich. He had
discovered a peculiar little hollow in one of the big
gum logs used to shore up the main drive, and being
naturally constituted to give heed to the possibilities
of rainy days, he dropped many a bit of gold into this
hollow, trusting to the luck the Devil bequeaths to his
friends to get it again some day. The mine was worked
out and abandoned, and for one reason or another —
excess of water most often —Donald was unable to get
at his little savings bank for many years. Eventually,
however, circumstances combined to make the thing
easy for the persevering Scott. He rigged a windlass
over the old mine, enlisted the aid of a simple mate
with a story of fossicking the old level, and went
below. When he traversed the wet, dark, muggy
drive, a flickering candle in his hand, he was shocked
and disgusted to find that the roof had come in at
just the spot where his bank was located ; but what
disturbed him most was to see the remains of a man
in a tattered shirt and an old slouch hat on the

edge of the fall. Closer investigation showed that
the man had been caught with one leg under a ear-
piece. Apparently he had gone into the mine while
the ladders were still serviceable. The dour Scott
left him sitting there, finding the log he was seeking
thrown almost clear of the reef and quite accessible.
A few strokes opened the bank, and Donald gleaned
twice as much gold as he had expected. In fact, a
man named Cooper on another shift had been placing
deposits in the same hollow. It was Cooper who sat
there, overlooking Scott in the act of withdrawing
his account. At any rate, it was Cooper’s bones.

“McNorth” : The traveller in inland Papua
who depends on local natives to transport his goods
is up against it if his supply of salt gives out. The
natives of those mountainous regions have a fondness
for strips of red calico and twist tobacco, they have
a sneaking regard for hand-mirrors and jews’-harps
and other white-man trade, but they simply crave
for salt. For a handful or so of it a man or a woman
will cheerfully carry a 501 b. load all day. At the
end of each day's march the carriers cluster round
the tauhada with broad pieces of banana or other
leaf in their hands. In- many instances the salt is
licked up as soon as it is placed on the leaf. There
is no quicker means of winning the goodwill of a
semi-hostile mountain chief than by a judicious
present of salt, and, as a rule, a good supply of
the stuff means little difficulty in securing carriers.
On the other hand it is no salt, no carriers. I was
caught there once without the necessary —my whole

SPADGE : "Well, thank God, there’s no dust."
supply was lost through an accident—and I had the
devil’s own job to get back to the coast. I argued
and coaxed and bullied and eventually managed to
cover a short week’s walk in 20 days. Yet a couple
of times the experiment of taking a bottle of sea-
water to the mountains resulted in every native
who tasted it spitting it out. They seemed to think
some kind of unpleasant joke was being played on
them.
“Wang”: While serving my apprentice-
ship to Matilda-humping I camped just outside Ingle-
wood (Vic.) for a few days. It was winter time,
and I considered myself fortunate in finding a large,
hollow log in which I spread my blankets and
dossed each night. One evening I retired as usual
and fell asleep. I hadn’t been there very long when
I heard a commotion and something breathing hard
and swearing gently wormed its way along till it
bumped its head against my boots. The object, on
my inquiring anxiously what it was, said it was a
man and requested me, in a hoarse whisper, to keep
quiet. I was just about to make an impassioned
reply when there came another noise at the end
of the log. The intruder wormed himself further
in, and laid his whiskers on my chest, while a
shrill female voice at the end of the log entreated
somebody to come out and be annihilated. My bed-
mate trembled violently and whispered, “Me missus,
she’s chased me here.”
After repeated and vain
invitations to be a man
and come out, silence,
feigned for about two
minutes while the en-
treated one wriggled
further into the log. lie
got his head up nearly
as far as my chin, while
I breathed curses into his
ears; and then the female
presented herself at the
end of the log again.
“Come out,” she wailed,
“and I’ll show yer.” Then
suddenly my room-mate
began to wriggle violently
and kick his legs. I in-
quired heatedly what the
demonstration was all
about. “Gripes! Whow!
O-ouu!” lie yelled. “Tl»’
blank’s pokin’ me with a
sapling. Whow! Shift
hup!” The fury relaxed
her efforts for a moment.
Then she yellow, “Who’s
that yer got in there, eh?
So that’s where yer been
puttin’ yer nights in
lately. Who is shef
Come out, I’ll show the
pair of yers!” “Whir-
rip!!” My companion
gave a jump that nearly
knocked my head off and
then started backing madly
out of the log. She
was waiting for him
outside, and sounds of heavy thumping came floating
up the hollow, along with “Wait till I’ve finished
with you and then I’ll give her a dose. ’ I don t
know what kind of domestic trouble I had bumped
up against, but I slept under a three-wire fence about
four miles further on for the rest of that night.
.
“T.S.M.”: The Papuan is a child. Humor
him as such and you’ll get on with him. When
the North Coast was first opened up some 15 years
ago a certain magistrate was engaged cutting a track
from Buna Bay to the foot of the ranges. The labor
was obtained by forced levies on the natives of the
villages en route, and they were all as wild as
hawks. One night the magistrate was awakened from
his sleep by a clamoring near his tent, and on going
out and inquiring the cause was informed that a
dead man was working on the road. I heard the
yarn a week after the incident, and I know what I
should have done, being raw and inexperienced. I
should have consigned them all to Hades and chiv-
vied them back to their beds, and then probably not
a man would have turned up to that job again.
Not so this wise English-johnny magistrate. Ostenta-
tiously selecting three sticks of tobacco, the recog-
nised remuneration for a day’s work, he disappeared
into the bush. Returning presently he informed the
assembled and horribly scared crowd that he had
paid the dead man off and he had gone home. Five
minutes later the camp was enveloped in slumber
once more.
“T. Weed”: The professional sorcerer of
Papua sometimes strikes a snag. Maione, a village
constable, in pursuance of orders received from the
local Resident, had effected the capture of a trouble-
some sorcerer called Evisa, and was taking him up
the Mambare in his dugout to the local jug. The
journey was a long one, and Evisa, lying bound
hand and foot in the bottom of the canoe, had plenty
of time to study the features of his captor and
went straight up. Then he evidently
got a bit nervy or something and
started to nose-dive, changed his mind,
looped the loop a couple of times and
side-slipped ; then the bunting fouled
his propeller, and I waited for him
to crash. However, he unwound him-
self, flattened out and landed on a
box-tree. His stunting evidently
attracted bis mates’ attention, be-
cause they circled his ’drome kick-
ing up a Fritz of a row. Probably
they were inviting him to do it
again. lie took off and tried to take
up station with his mates, who scaled
in all directions. The last I saw
of him he was making heavy weather
of it, going flat-out, his streamers
waving in the breeze. This hap-
pened a fortnight ago, and I have
not seen a crow on this sector since,
though they were pretty thick before.
make a guess as to his gullibility. Maione, in
response to the urgent appeals of the sorcerer,
released the latter’s hands, whereupon Evisa pro-
ceeded to throw light on a lot of mysterious hap-
penings in the constable’s family. Producing three
fragments of string from his waistbelt, he directed
Maione’s particular attention to certain small pieces
of wood knotted into them —eight on each string.
Then he proceeded to explain them. “This fella,
that mother belong you. I make pourri-pourri along
her. She die. This fella, brother belong you,” etc.,
etc. In this way Evisa explained how all Maione’s
dead relations and friends had come by their end.
The moral of the story would have been: “More
better you look out, Maione.” But that warning
was never uttered. Too late Evisa saw that the
constable, instead of gibbering with fear, was a
very angry man. Pulling into the bank, Maione
carefully and cold-bloodedly selected a huge stone.
This he strapped to the now craven Evisa’s body,
and, pulling out to the middle of the stream,
lowered the destroyer of his family’s happiness over
the side. An hour’s immersion soaked all the origi-
nal sin out of the sorcerer, whose body was duly
delivered by a phlegmatic Maione to an astonished
R.M. that night. The V.C. was duly tried, sentenced
to death, respited and confined for three years as
warder of the local clink.

“8.N.J.”: I caught a crow in a rabbit-
trap the other day, tied two or three pieces of
Turkey twill about a yard long to his undercarriage
and let him go. He made a beautiful take-off and
“Trochus”: I struck my flapper a hundred
miles beyond Mrs. Gunn’s “Never Never.” She was
head serang over about 100 goats, and had them
all named appropriately. There was the Kaiser,
“because he was such a rotter” ; and Haig and Foch,
“because since they’ve grown up they knock
out of the Kaiser.” There was Nelson, with one
eye, Cromwell with a big head, the Dutchman with
a square head, and Mephistopheles—“ Look at his
horns and hoofs! ” But the daddy of all was a pot-
bellied kid a little larger than a nutmeg, and his
name was Pussyfoot Johnson. “Why?” said I.
“Oh, that little devil-—he’s always getting out of
the pen and suckin’ his mother dry.”

“Wang”: Splodger O'Toole, on the wal-
laby, called at Sam Hobson’s farm to ask for a
job. It was the poddies’ meal-time, and old Sam
and his daughter Ellen, a buxom lass of 18, were
busy ministering to their wants. Ellen might have
been mistaken for a model displaying the latest
thing in women’s skirts if you judged only by the
length of it. Old Sam had a calf’s head in a bucket,
and Ellen was bending over another, when Splodger
made his request for work. “D’yer know anything
about calves?” asked old Sam. Splodger didn’t; but
he wasn’t going to let a trifle like that stop him.
“Oh, yes,” he replied—“a bit. And if you take
me on I’ll soon learn more.” But his luck was
out, for Splodger happened to be looking in Ellen’s
direction as he made the reply, and old Sam saw
him.

“Jonah”: When Ross Smith and his
brother landed at Fannie Bay (Darwin) last Decem-
ber, the aborigine prisoners at the gaol were allowed
a view of the machine as it ftew into the gaol
paddock, which was used as an aerodrome. After
looking at it hard Terrindilly turned to Wardith
and said, “Big fellow egg belong him!” On Parer
and Mclntosh’s arrival the prisoners were again
allowed to “look see.” This time Terrindilly turned
to Wardith and remarked, “Him chicken belong
that one big-fellow conic before.”
“Dux”: The man with the ginger whiskers
blew the froth off his sixth pint, spat reflectivelj,
and said: “The finest axemen I ever ran aerost

to keep the hark and stuff from smothering Paddy.
An’ even on the wettest day Paddy always worked dry,

Rata, got Paddy up to slaughter a few thousand
acres of miro? No? Why, I thort everybody
knowed that Paddy simply nicked each tree and
then give the end one of ’em a push. About a
fortnight later, just as Paddy was gettin’ home from

“To Pana”: In out-of-tlie-way spots in the
Pacific native marriage customs still hold sway when
the missionary man is busy elsewhere. At Rotumah,
north of Fiji, the couple sit for a whole day on
colored mats, their limbs bound together with hand-
kerchiefs, while the populace hang around dancing
and making horrible noises. The bride’s maiden
lock is cut off and a piece of poetry is said over it.
Instead of signing the register the bridegroom lights
a native cigarette and passes it over to his spouse.
Follows feasting for seven days, the wedded couple
being fed every two hours during this period. In
some of the remote dependencies of the French
Pacific the bride is first paid a great compliment
(I needn't go into details) by all the nobles and
high chiefs. The husband sits on the mat and merely
sees that his bride is treated with due respect. In
other of the islands, when a husband goes to another
place where dwell his wife’s unmarried sisters, it is
de rigueur that, out of his love for her, he should
pay them all the same compliment. Always, how-
ever, is excluded “the village maiden.” The honor
of her virginity is the public honor and pride.

ton. One day in early summer I saw a black snake
sunning himself on one side of a gum-tree. Soon
afterwards I saw a brown fellow on the other side
of the same tree. After watching for a few moments
I saw that the snakes had spied one another. Soon
the brown one commenced to swallow the other,
tail first. The black reptile did not like it, so he
commenced on the other’s tail. Keeping on swallow-
ign they gradually closed tighter and tighter around
the gum. In a fortnight the tree was dead.

“M.H.S.”: A retired Scotch farmer and
his wife decided to buy a pony and “jinker” ; and
Sandy sailed off and bought the outfit, which he
duly brought home and introduced to his wife. As
they had no stable yet built it was decided to take
the animal to a local livery stable. The boss offered
to do the job for 15s. per week, and after some

demur came down to 10s. This was still no good to
McTavish, who suggested 7s. as a fair thing. The
livery-stable keeper at last let it go at that, and
McTavish went home chuckling to his wife about
the way he had beaten the man down. “Ah’m not
so sure,” said Mrs. McTavish, “that Ah couldn’t

HOSPITALITY.
[For The Bulletin.]
John Henry on his honeymoon
Went up to Billybrook,
Arriving late. There was no moon.
He hadn’t thought to book.
The pub was full. A scrubby man
With bland indiff’rence sail:
“Go up the hill to Mrs. Dann —
She’ll do the very best she can
To fix yous up a bed.”
A light was in the window, so
They found Dann’s house all right.
She had a Spring-time overflow,
So on into the night
Went Henry with his spouse to find
Up through the gully’s mire
McNally’s house. The bush was blind
And they were lost. To fate resigned
John Henry lit a fire.
And there on bracken he had cut
They sat amid the smoke.
Then came one crawling from a butt.
A ragged-whiskered bloke.
He heard their touching tale. Said he:
“1 ain’t no ’eartless ’og\
Your weddin’ night aneath a tree?
Such things they didn’t ought to be—
Here, have my ’oiler log!”

The Savage.
OUT of the gloom of the forest I came
in the ancient days ;
Now, leaving behind in the night the
glare of cities ablaze,
Naked and empty handed, with shouting
heart I go
Back to the ways of the forest, the leaf-soft
paths I know.
Shout a song triumphant, a chant of the flint
and the bone!
Sing a psean full-throated of knives and the
hammer of itone!
Hi, for the arrow and spear and the beasts
so fierce and fleet!
Hi, for the blood on my hands and the prey
that lies at my feet!
Out of the forest I came discarding the flint
and bone,
And long, long years have I wrought to
build a world of my own ;
But back I go, rejoicing to hear behind in
my flight
The crash of the falling columns of towns
that burn in the night.
The hairy ape was my mother, but I left the
protecting trees; .
Upright I strove with' my foes, battered the
beasts to their knees;
Weapons I made with my hands and struck
the fire from the stone,
Then out of the forest I came to build a
world of my own.
Aye, and witness I built it for what it may
have been worth,
And I harnessed the air and the water and
conquered the forces of earth ;
The fire was ever beside me as painfully up-
ward I fought....
But I smelt the woods in the gloom and
wrecked the thing I had wrought.
There may have been much of beauty in
the thousand things I made,
But the streets grew dirty and dark and I
in my heart was afraid ;
Then God spoke straight to my heart —and I
care no whit for the doom
Of that which my rage destroyed when the
forest called in the gloom.
And now as of old I shall find a shelter for
me in the trees;
With naked hands I shall batter my ancient
foes to their knees;
Then when my soul is purer shall seek in the
cold, clean air
And find God again in the mountains await-
ing His servant there.
Perhaps new light will be shown me, and yet
again I will go
Out of the heart of the forests, leaving the
paths I know.
Discarding the flint-tipped arrows and
cumbersome axe of stone.
And. with eyes that can see truth better, will
build a world of my own.
Shout out a song triumphant, a chant of the
flint and the bone !
Sing a. psean full-throated of knives and the
hammer of stone;
Hi. for the arrow and spear and the boasts
so fierce and fleet!
Hi, for the blood on my hands and the prey
that lies at my feet!

Nostalgia.
T WANT the quiet ways of old ;
1 I want my cottage thatched with cloth-
of-gold.
The chintz-hung casements, where the April
rain
Pattered like music on the window-pane.
I want the jasmined eaves, that from their
height
Dropped waxen stars of perfume in the night,
And where each morning, ’twixt the dawn
and dark,
There trilled the lyric of the waking lark.
I want the old barn huddled in the sun—
His pride at zenith and the high noon Avon ;
The gold-brown hills, the fields, the broken
fence,
The lilac-tree that shook its innocence
Upon the breeze, that kissed it to the sea.
I want them all—oh, give them back to me!
I want the inglenook. where, half-asleep,
My dog lay gazing at the log fire’s leap,
While those old books I touched with
reverent hands
Glowed in the firelight with illumined bands.
I want my birthright back again—
My old town with its rumbling mid-day train
That drew into the station noisily.
While groups of children watched expect-
antly.
This mansion house, its stately corridors,
Tts Persian rugs and highly-polished floors.
The limousine that Avaits my beck and call.
The retinue —God ! I Avould give them all
If I might have again the soft caress
Of my old home and all its simpleness!

Metamorphosis.
IF I were master and keeper of the gates of
the Garden of Death,
Nor shadowy yew nor cypress, bitter
and gnarled and dense,
Nor pine nor the sighing cedar should cur-
tain the gold, intense,
Glad flame of the day, and muffle the breeze
to a ghostly breath.
Like a music of color, fiery and tender and
splendid, dawn
Flames high o’er the hidden garden, and
fiery and far and dim,
Like a rose-red restless ocean, the tides of
the sunset swim.
Yet ever over the garden a hueless dusk is
drawn !
Glimmering aisles of silence, grey leaves on
the sunless mould—
If mine were the gates of the garden there
should be laughter here!
In place of the sombre shadow of boughs
that are chill and sere.
Song, and the scented pennons of wind-tossed
wattle-gold !
And, fairer than waxen lilies, cold as an
Arctic breath,
Under the blossom breakers of the wattle’s
amber flood.
There should be roses, roses, roses as red
as blood.
Like a splendid paean of passionate life in
the Garden of Death !

When Mollie Sings.
WHEN Mollie sings her birthday song
The little finger tightly lace
Behind the snow-white party dress;
When Mollie sings her birthday song
The little fingers tightly lace
Behind the snow-white party dress;
Her tiny throat is like a gong
That trembles in the ecstasy
Of making music and her face,
Upturned and glowing, bears a free
Delight and all unknowing grace
Of joy in her own loveliness;
When Mollie sings her birthday song.
And wears her snow-white party dress.
When Mollie sings her birthday song,
The soft piano-notes ring low
Like far-off bells that chime to bless;
For, newborn from that tender throng,
A tiny sound-child flutters in;
As, thrilled beneath a loving bow,
The third on some old violin
Kindles an overtone aglow;
And glad airs melt in wistfulness
When Mollie sings her birthday song
And wears her flowing party dress.
When Mollie sings her birthday song,
The thin, pure flame of melody
Heals the dull pain of day’s distress;
Its burning beauty steals along
The listeners in the shaded room,
Till souls learn tongues of gentle glee
And lose their speech of ledger-gloom.
A glad new Pentecost they see
In the sweet fire of girlishness.
When Mollie sings her birthday song
And. radiant, wears her snow-white dress.

SAINTS’ shadows from the windows
slant
On altar-stone and pall;
The air is heavy with the chant,
The organ’s long notes fall.
One’s weeping here, one sighing there,
One sobs at every note;
I only think of swift brown hair
On' the night's breath afloat.
And I forget you faded, dear,
As tired flowers fail —
That now you wear the white shroud here,
And not the bridal veil.
Again I feel hot kisse.s thrill
My soul to ecstasy,
And little rapturous whispers fill
The sombre litany.
Again I see your great grey eyes,
Aflame with fire o’ mine;
The carven Christ seems strangely wise.
And suddenly divine.
Again I touch you. breast and arm
(Comes your low laugh, the while),
And icv marble eyes grow warm.
And ‘stone-lipped virgins smile.
From its time-builded cenotaph
Comes forth the past, .until
In sheer delight I laugh. I laugh;
And the shocked crowd grows still.

rjf Little Bits of Sewing.
K A Y gleaming needle slips in and
IVI out, in and out
And 1 think of all the dreams
That are sighing in the seams
Of eaeh little bit of sewing in the big world
round about.
There’s a woman who does sewing all the
day down the street;
She is thin and grey and still,
Very quiet, very chill,
And I try to find the dreams
She has slipped into the seams
Of the little bits of sewing she has done for
me;
Maybe
There are warm and sunny spots
Tangled in among the knots;
I would love to light upon them and to find
there’s something sweet,
Something that makes life worth owning,
Something more than endless droning
Over frocks for fractious women who do
nothing but complain,
Twist and turn and carp and crane
At the mirror of my grey, quiet woman down
the .street.
My gleaming needle slips in and out, in and
out.
And I dream of all the thought
Which is woven in and wrought
With each little bit of sewing in the big world
round about.
Busy girls are stitching fast with faces bright
as morning
(Oh. the little bits of sewing for a bonny
bride’s adorning !) ;
There are placid women sewing, singing soft,
soft indeed,
Over all the quaintly dainty things that
babies seem to need.
Other fingers fly along on work which has
been ordered —
Lace work and linen work, or curtains
brightly bordered :
Frocks and frills and furbelows, and every
worker’s mind
Dreaming dreams beautiful, wistful or un-
kind.
Dreaming dreams —oh, that one could see
inside the heads
As the long seam lengthens or the pattern
spreads!
Oh, that one might see inside the heads, and
so inspired.
Give every worker swiftly what her dream-
ing heart desired !
I want a cornucopia,
A mammoth cornucopia,
From which to pour each worker out the
dreams her heart desired.
My gleaming needle slips in and out, in and
out,
And I think of all the dreams
That are sighing in the seams
Of each little bit of sewing in the big world
round about.

A Ballad of Gramarie.
THERE’S nothing novel beneath the sun.
So the ponderous sages say ;
In well-worn ruts all our fancies run
From their weakling birth to their swift
decay;
Stale all things in the glare of day,
No far, fair visions for hope to view;
But night shall come and our grief allay,
For all things under the moon are new.
Over the hills, when the day is done,
Flowers she then like a bough of may
In a fairy field where the stars have spun
Nets to tangle each blossomy ray ;
Glimmering, moth-like, elf and fay
Hang the grasses with wreaths of dew,
Fresh as the lilt of their laughter gay.
For all things under the moon are new.
Beneath her glamor the earth has won
A shadow’s freedom, and mountains stray,
Illusive shapes, in a void whence none
Can conjure them till the dawning gray,
And the lyric voices of seas at play
Twining their silvery mazes through
Drench the spheres with a dulcet spray.
For all things under the moon are new.
L’Envoy.
Fair Selene, one touch we pray
Of the wild, white magic your glances
brew.
To sweep the tangible world away.
For all things under the moon are new.

If I Should Listen.
IF I should listen when the night is still
And starlit, and the wind is hushed in
sleep
Amid th’ expectant silver silence deep
And strange, before the moon above the hill
Comes golden pale—if I should listen till
The evening’s soft enchantment seems to
steep
My soul in mystery, and subtly keep
Beneath a faery spell my thought and will,
Would he who sleeps in Scyros, speaking low.
Tell me what dreams are his encompassed
By sun-swept leagues of blue iEgean Sea,
’Neath dawn’s white magic, or the Western
glow
Of sudden sunset, while above his head
The lonely sea-winds pass continually?

Sybarite.
WRAP me in the prismy air
That summer skies at sunset wear,
The golden-tissuecl scarf of noon,
The silver samite of the moon,
With a zone wrought marvellously
Of limpid light and sapphire sea !
Let the laughing breezes run
Like sweet fancies just begun,
In and out with censers swinging
Petals broadcast, and the clinging
Perfumes of the rich old earth,
To a wafted sound of mirth
Not more noisy than the song
Crooned by mothers, as along
The world’s round cheek the shadows
creep
Like dusky lashes dropped in sleep.
All the singing air must be
For me attuned enchantingly
To the song the freshet sings.
And butterflies shall paint their wings
To mock the sky’s transcendent blue,
And flowers steal the rainbow’s hue,
And lawns grow greener than deep seas,
And nectared fruits bow down the trees,
The while I lie at cushioned leisure
Aswoon with life and drowsed with
. pleasure.
Till robed in beauty’s ecstasy
Death lays a languorous hand on me.

Ominous shadows that silently plead,
Bankrupt am I, as you well can see,
Empty of treasure and futile of deed.
Merciful shadow's, have pity on me!

Shadows stealing over the sea!

Fey.
TOSS your slippers away, away,
Fairy girl of a lone man’s dreams!
Moonlight dances across the bay;
Laughing water and silver spray.
Tickling sand, and our toes shall play
Till you flee when the pink dawn gleams.
Nought it matters to such as w ? e
That I be dreaming, you be fey—
Never the eyes of Day shall see
The starry trails of our gaiety,
Judge our folly or mock our glee
Or frighten our happy love away.
Yesternight in a bushy glade
(An old dog-fox to watch, maybe)
To the haunting curlew’s serenade
Stately measures we stepped and swayed,
Wonderful, prim and dull and staid— '
Till you giggled in mockery.
“Snails and lovers!” you chanted low
(Ah. moonlit Eden and fairy Eve!),
“Snails are fast and my lover slow,
Catch me, kiss me! Away we go !”
Nimble body and dainty toe
Lingered not for a by-your-leave!
Down the glade like a hunted sprite.
Spangled smock in your wake a stream,
Glimpsed, agleam in a pool of light.
Poised, to vanish in headlong flight
Into the tangled glooms of night—
So you lured me, dear o’ my dream.
Feet that flitted where mischief led.
Light feet topping a tumbled tree,
Sure, though snares ’mid the grass lie
spread ;
Lilting laughter that hailed ahead
The drag and trip of my clumsy tread
When the brackens had ambushed me.
Fickle in flight as a butterfly.
Fleet in flight as a frightened fawn,
Supple and sweet and sure and sly,
You the quarry, the hunter I
Vainly hunting, till day was nigh.
Till a cold wind greeted the dawn.
Magpies stirred in a dew-jewelled tree.
Looming eastward a pallid glow:
Break o’ day!—then you came to me
Into my arms caressingly.
Lips a-pout for the kiss-to-be—
“ Hold me! Kiss me ! For soon I go.”
Warm breasts close to my own breast laid
( Ah ! the torment of curbed desire !),
Little red mouth by love betrayed.
Bud of your girlhood, fairy maid,
Yielding its sweetness unafraid,
Bud of purity, bud of fire!
“Sweet, the hounds of the crimson day
Follow swift on the trails of night!”
Still, so still in my arms you lay.
Sighed, and kissed me, and slipped away....
Ah. that night could for ever stay.
Night of my love, my dreamed desire!
* * * *
Toss your slippers away, array.
Dainty maid of my lonely dreams!
Boyish to-night my heart and gay —
Lore is silly ; ’tis wise to play.
Revel and dance in the sand and spray.
Hand in hand with the wet moonbeams!

SHOULD
WOMEN
SMOKE?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You ask should any woman smoke,
And slily smile at me
In such a way as would provoke
A saint to gallantry.
Look in the mirror whilst you puff
Your scented cigarette,
And that will tell you, right enough,
If you should smoke, Nanette.
Be not a “fiend,” dear little girl;
Have eyes for other things
Than watching cloudlets upward curl
In lazy, blue-grey rings;
Inhale not, like those pale young men
Who live to learn regret:
But let your senses, now and then,
Be swathed in smoke, Nanette.
Not in the morning, nor at noon.
Girls are but girls: methinks
The “habit” changes, all too soon,
A syren to a minx:
But after dinner, if you fain
Would keep me in your debt,
Look sweet, and tell me once again
To light your fag, Nanette.
Should women smoke? Should candles flirt
With moths that flutter round?
Should Cupid shoot the darts that hurt?
Should girls be cutely gowned
To show the curve of bust and hips?
Put down that cigarette!
I’d sip the nectar from your lips
Between the puffs, Nanette.

Pierrette and Pan.
[Fok The Bulletin.]
OYER the hill where no tree's are
A lily finger of moonlight pointed,
And the meadow of Heaven, pale and
far,
Broke into blossoms, star by star;
The grasses whitened, pearl-anointed.
Over the hill from the little town
Tripped pretty Pierrette, all a-shiver;
Bike moth-wings wavered hey gauzy gown,
Charmed and frightened she fluttered down.
Drawn to the brink of the narrow river.
He was standing where flag-flowers grow
(Where leaves are thick hoofs may be
hidden).
Pierrette curtsied ; Pan laughed low.
Then set his pipes to his lips to blow—
Oh. wild melody, sweet, forbidden !
I low it tickled her little high heels
And the toes that satin and spangles
cover!
As the moth round the candle flirts and
wheels,
So Pierrette, airing her footlight reels.
Danced to her strange and terrible lover.
And tin 1 Bord of the Woods for once was
shy
(Fauns made sly fun of it ever after) ;
His fingers trembled, his pipes wailed high,
And star by star did the wondering sky
Dimple in mute Olympic laughter.
Rapt in each other, puzzled, afraid.
Bittle they cared if the world had seen
them.
Shaggy brown god and bedizened maid
In the mad moonlight—so Pan played
And Pierrette danced, with the stream
between them.
Pierrette, panting, naused tiptoe.
Blew a kiss over the narrow river;
Pan dropped his pipes in the water below.
And wooed with amorous whispering, so
Burning it made the flag-flowers quiver.
“I cannot come till you call me to cross
With a heart for my heart,” was the end
of his pleading.
“Pretty queer moth just alit on the moss.
You have robbed me of power, pay loss for
sweet loss—
Speak, and I come.!” But she smiled un-
heeding.
Yes, Pierrette turned from the Wood God’s
call
With a. farewell smile that stung like a
nettle.
Was her gay little heart too wise, too small?
And had she a heart in her breast at all
Or only a perfumed pink rose-petal ?
His pipes were lost and his words were vain ;
Great Pan stole back to his forest banished.
But cried through the moonlight, human with
pain,
“Come again, Butterfly, come, come again !”
And Pierrette curtsied, laughed and
vanished.
Over the hill to the little town.
Proud, half-penitent, all uncertain.
With a secret spark in her eyes of brown.
She fled to her Pierrot’s anxious frown
As he fretted behind the waiting curtain.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONE Saturday afternoon a knot of
people were drawing water from the
stand-pipe in Settlement-road. They
were the residents of the district, and it
was from this fount that their needs were
supplied. The settlement was an arid spot,
once homestead paddocks, but now cut up
into handkerchief lots, each half-built cottage
or skillion depending (apart from the stand-
pipe) entirely on Providence and the rain-
the charm that polite people
DON’T MENTION.
"No, she isn’t pretty, hut she has that in-
definable something”
"I es, I know; my girl's old man has piles
of it!”
fall for the means of irrigation. This year
there had been a drought, and the settlers,
with the endurance of camels, had carried
every drop of water they consumed —in
buckets, barrows, trucks —by child- and goat-
labor, by men “after work,” by women at
all times.
Tanks were empty, dams dry. Not a blade
of grass grew in the hungry ground, not a
flower. Everywhere the small gardens were
dead with the exception of that surround-
ing Thomas Thomas’s place. His was like
“a rock in a weary land.” as Martha Polglase
said. The Polglases were new arrivals from
England. They were Salvationists, and
Martha’s speech was liberally bestrewn with
Biblical phrases.
Thomas’s place bore evidence of much
“bucketing.” He had vegetables galore and.
hard as it was to believe, water-melons.
Water-melons! In a waterless desert! Ilis
garden came in for much jealous comment
among the jaded company at the stand-pipe.
“Well, it be this way,” explained Martha
Polglase eagerly. “As thee knaws, Tummas
be own brother to me as well as in th’ Board,
an’ ’e do tell that ’e watters the garden b’
night when other sinners do be sleepin’—
after night shift —at 8 in the marnin’. Tied
up in rags 'is bucket ’andles do be, for 'e
will distarb none. Not even Ann, ’is wife,
do ’ear ’im—she do be tired, pore dear, takin'
in washin’ as she do. An’ she do thraw all
th’ suds on th’ vegetables, an’ with Board’s
blessin’ the garden do flourish like a green
bay-tree. No. no.” she added, countering
jealous criticism, “ ’tidn’ luck, ’tis industry.
Industry, suds an’ His blessin’ do work
miracles.”
It was so. The Thomas garden indeed
was an oasis, and stood out boldly as an
instance of what man and God might accom-
plish. Its owner, giving credit where it. was
due, often said, piously : “My gardin do be
a monneyment to the Power an’ Glary ; an’
Goard ’elps them that ’elps themselves.”
That day Martha Polglase was frying
bread for tea and bringing her husband up-
to-date with domestic news. “Do 'ee know
that Thomas be giving me his biggest watter-
melon?” she asked. “Well, ’tis so; sure ’nawf
V did give that giant-big one grawing back
of ’is shed. ‘Seein’ you do be my sister.’ ’e
said. ‘I won’t see ’ee stuck fer Festival.
Seein’ Polglase bain’t no ’and at raisin’ a
harvest.,’ ’e did say to me, ‘I be givin’ ’ee
the watter-melon—’tis a sacrifice unto the
Board. You take en an’ offer en up at
festival on Sunday. Seein’ as Almighty
Goard did single me out fer blessin’, ’tidn’
fair I should be stingy,’ ’e did say to me.”
“Bain’t there any meat?” interrupted
Henry Polglase querulously. His wife threw
up her hands in amazement. “Meat?” she
cried. “Meat? On a Saturday night? What’s
come over ’ee, ’Enry? Bain’t ’ee ’aving meat
to-morrow? One would take ’ee for a waste-
ful Australian ! Meat!”
Gloomily Henry helped himself to bread.
He was in a pessimistic mood. Not so
Martha. She took up her paean. “They do
say my brother Tummas be a saintly man,
an’ so ’e be, sure ’nawf. So generous with
that purty melon, though I do be sister to
un. Head an’ front of the offerings she will
be —turmits bain’t in same street.”
“Did ’e pay ’ee the ninepenee?” inter-
rupted Henry again.
“Ninepenee? What ninepenee?” asked
Martha in surprise.
“The ninepenee ’e did borrow from ’ee
laast three weeks.”
“No, ’e dicin’ neither,” she replied, offer. -
dedly, “Ninepenee! ’Aven’t ’e give us pint
aafter pint of goat’s milk, an you naggin’
’bout ninepenee! What’s ninepenee?”
“Ninepenee be ninepenee,” Henry
answered severely. “Twice nine be 18. Count
up—fower times ninepenee be three shilluffi.
An’ you ask what be ninepenee?”
“ ’Pears to me you do carry a ready-
reckoner in your middle.” his wife answered
bitterly. “ ’Cordin' to that system, Tummas
do be givin’ fower watter-melons.”
She spoke contemptuously, but Henry’s
skin was thick. “Ninepenee Tummas do be
owing me. an’ ninepenee ’e do be going to
pay. ‘An eye for an eye,’ saith Almighty
Goard.”
It was after dark when Henry set out
at Duty’s call, fortified by an unwonted
bottle of beer hidden in his woodshed. The
land of plenty where grew the promised
water-melon was his goal. Usually a con-
tented man, some demon of revolt was gnaw-
ing at his vitals. Here was his brother-in-
law, strong as a donkey, working day and
night with a wife who took in washing!
Making money! Growing vegetables, a
Chinaman might envy. While he, Henry
Pol'glase, had all he could do to live! Top
of that, a goat had once
eaten his turnips and the
goat was Tummas’s goat.
And top of that the thriv-
ing man had borrowed
ninepenee and forgotten
to repay it.
This seemed the limit.
The hand of misfortune
lay heavy upon him. If
God remembered him at
all it was in bulk with
the common - herd, not
personally and with an
eye to detail as lie did
in the case of Tummas.
As the neat home of
the elect came to view
the doubter found him-
self in the mood for in-
cendiarism. There it
stood, fresh and prosper-
ous, throwing off the
delicious scent of grow-
ing things. The garden
soil bore evidence of
much “bucketing.” “But
then ’e do live within
three hunnerd foot of
watter supply, so ’tidn’
much wonder ’e do work
miracles, sure ’nawf.”
No one was stirring.
Tummas himself was on
night-shift. and his
womenfolk away delivering “the washing.”
Henry, looking at the garden lying there
like a green jewel in the fading light, felt
vaguely that Thrift and Industry were
Pagan gods which ran the Almighty close
for precedence in the breast of its owner.
There lay the melon. A perfect globe,
striped in greens and about the size of a
drum, it dominated the scene. Even Henry
was impressed by the munificence of the
gift unto the Bord, as, wrestling mightily,
he triid to insert it into his brother-in-law’s
hand-truck. It was a big struggle. The
melon seemed to possess some mischievous
spirit urging it to roll off time after time.
It was so ripe. too. that at every bump it
gave forth ghostly reverberations. The
bottle of beer played tricks also with Henry’s
eyesight, showing him as by magic a picture
of the melon’s interior —a deep pink, fes-
tooned with fat brown-edged seeds. It was
the unattainable melon of his boyhood. His
mouth watered. Had it been a beer-melon
its history would have ended there and
then.
Time found it midway to the Barracks,
negotiating rough country. The earth is
surly hereabouts, hunching its shoulders and
CONSCIENTIOUS.

drawing apart into sections, leaving great
cracks into which the wheels of a truck may
fit snugly. Thickets of thistles, also, only
awaiting tl»e advent of human ankles, in-
censed Henry so much that he almost
cursed. “’Tidn’ fair” —j01t... .j01t... .bump
—he cried to Heaven. “Somethin’ wrong.
Here be I workin’ fer nothing but th’ glowry
o’ Goard” —bump....jolt—-“while Tummas
be workin’ fer double time.... Ninepenee !”
Here the melon again fell off.
Henry was now approaching “the street,”
as the hub of Greenville was called, and occa-
sional lamp-posts were met with. As his
track was downhill the melon rolled until it
fetched up against one. It cracked ! Henry
mopped his brow. Here was trouble indeed.
The “offering” damaged! It was a bad
fracture, and Henry’s cup was full. That
the one Festival offering to his household’s
credit should be thus mutilated! He ex-
amined the wound. Yes. the melon in its
ripeness needed but a touch to fall asunder.
“And two halves be a poor gift unto the
Board fer sartin,” he thought.
“Why not .sell one half?” a voice whispered
in his ear. Henry started violently; sweat
broke over his back. His nostrils, trained
to strange odors by the goats of his district,
now -scented a foreign one —brimstone.
“Sell half,” again whispered the voice.
“He owes you ninepenee.”
Henry glanced aside and sensed a queer-
looking man glimmering there surrounded by
an aura of blue flame and smoke, through
which brilliant, sinful eyes shone like
beacons.
Sinful? Yes, it was the Devil. Henry
knew him instantly. “Get thee behind me,
Satan,” he whimpered, holding on to his hair.
“Tempt me not.”
“Only to what is your own, friend.” said
the Evil One from a rear position. “Water-
melons at present are fetching high prices at
Antonio’s.”
“But it isn’t mine,” whined Henry, tem-
porising.
“Nonsense, man,” said Satan curtly. “He
owes you ninepenee.”
But his listener could not be wooed so
easily from the narrow path.
“I am a Salvation soldier,” he said feebly.
“But not a fool. I hope,” said Satan in a
voice of silk. “Sell half —sell half. See —
it wants but a touch to break. Take one
piece to the Barracks, and the other to An-
tonio's. He will give several ninepences
for it. So long, friend.”
“’E do owe me ninepenee,” murmured
Henry, dully. “ ‘An eye fer an eye,’ saith
the Board.”
It was late when Henry returned the bor-
rowed truck. Bike a thief he skulked into
the garden. He was a felon. He suffered
as all must who forsake the narrow path.
Yet he nursed a sense of justice done. In
his vest pocket lay ninepenee in silver which
he fingered from time to time; but, bending
to replace the truck, the sixpenny piece leapt
out and was lost.
“Devil-earned and devil-lost,” thought
Henry in dismay. “ ’Tis wicked money fer
sartin.” Nevertheless he groped and foraged
in the darkness, plunging his fingers in the
water-soaked soil, clutching at cabbage-
roots, young onions, mint, mumbling as he
dug, “ ’Tid’n’ ’onest—’tis wicked silver. I
must ’ave trod un into th’ ground.”
Then success came and he unearthed the
coin from the soil —and something else!
Something that shook him to the core.
Something that sent him on all fours with
nose to ground and fingers busily tracking
what. tt Pnl^laso

The Harvest Festival at Greenville Army
Barracks was one long remembered. I" or,
though theoretically in the hands of a benefi-
cent Providence, a perfect maelstrom of evil
influence was whirling through the atmo-
sphere. Distrust, suspicion, accusation ran
from the Thomas-Polglase faction, affecting
all telepathically ami causing a sister with
a ' on g> pale face like a vegetable-marrow
who was singing “Ha-a-arves’ so bee-yu-ti-
ful” to falter and break down, quite discon-
certing those reclaimed ones whose testi-
monies, beginning “Dear frien’s, I’m so
wappy to-day becus,” appeared to have been
made by machinery.
And the root of the trouble was the half of
a gigantic water-melon that was king of all
other growths on the platform.
Astonished by the sight of half where he
had donated a whole, Tummas had, at first,
given signs of apoplexy; but, loosening his
collar as a precaution, he had then passed
a note to Henry, seated further forward.
“Where be other half?” the script had
said. Henry’s reply Svas verbal and cryptic.
“Ninepenee,” he sent back by medium of in-
tervening tongues. “Ninepenee.” “Nine-
pence?” The word was whispered from lip
to lip.
From her seat on the platform Martha
Polglase’s eyes interrogated her husband
and brother in turn. She felt afraid. Her
faith in One above was not sufficient for the
situation.
“Ninepenee.” “Ninepenee!” Distinctly
the mysterious word reached her, percolat-
ing among the bonnets. A recent conver-
sation concerning a ninepenny debt rushed
back on a tide of recollection. What had
Henry done?
Her brother’s face was appalling. Rage
had swelled it to cracking-point. He was
like a corked Vesuvius. She heard but little
of the captain’s discourse. Nor did Henry,
furtively glancing backward at the man he
had robbed. Now and then, however, a word
found its mark. “The beyootiful offering of
Brother Polglase.” The captain tapped the
half-melon lightly with his book and went
on with his eulogy. “And while giving
thanks t*o all who contributed to this abun-
dance”—he indicated the mass of bought
vegetables round his feet —“I'm sure hall of
us thenk Brother Polglase the giver, and
Brother Tummas the grower, of this—this
mammoth of the soil. I am told, comrades,
that Brother Tummas works wonders in ’is
garden to the glowry o’ th’ Board.”
“Halley-looyah, a-men!” interjected the
staff.
“Yes. comrades an’ frien’s, I 'ear on good
authority that ’e grew this melon with great
difficulty, water not bein’ laid on ’is land,
an’ the Loard fer 'is own good reasons with-
’olding rain, brother Tummas ’ad to carry
water to it by ’and. from seedling to —er—
to matchoority. Then, through Brother
Polglase, ’e donated this ’alf to the glowry
of”
“I donated the whole melon. Cap’n,” inter-
rupted Brother Thomas. “Tidn’ my way to
do things be halves!”
The effect of this was magical. Decorum
fled and excitement took her place. A kind
of religious uproar arose. “Hallelujahs”
and “Amens” and “O Boards” mingled
with groans. The band started to play
softly. People stood on the seats. Martha
Polglase was being fanned with a hymn-book,
and all necks were craning.
Thomas faced his brother-in-law. “Where
be other haalf o’ this melon?” he demanded
sternly.
“I sold un.” answered Henry defiantly.
“Wha-a-at? Sold un? Fer what’”
Thomas gasped.
“Fer ninepenee.”


“Ninepenee!” cried the robbed, mystified.
"Aoiepenee: ’ cried many tongues.
“Yes, indeed!” repeated Henry, valiantly.
“To Antonio. For ninepenee.”
“Gracious marcy,” groaned Thomas. “You
sold—that —half—o’ my melon—for nine-
pence—is that all ’e did give ’ee? ’E be a
usurer an’ you be a thief.”
“No! ’E be a Catholic,” answered Henry,
“an’ I don’t be no thief neither. You owe
me ninepenee an’ I took it. that be all. But
what did you take, Tummas Tummas?”
Henry, climbing to a seat for prominence,
now took the part of an accusing judge.
“You do be the thief. Tell un all how 'ee
do get th’ garden to graw. Tell un ’ow
Lisbeth Ann do pitch ’er suds on to it! Tell
un ’ow ’ee do bucket watter all night, when
lazy men like we do be slapin’! Yon an’
your buckets! You do watter garden with
stolen watter from a tap!”
There was an awful sensation. Most of
the congregation sat down, enfeebled with
shock.
Thomas Thomas, his purple face now pale,
listened as though petrified. “Yes. frien’s.
this pillar of the Army an’ chosen o’ the
Loard do steal all watter from the main—
’e do sure ’nawf. I did see it with my own
eyes. ’E did lay a ’alf-ineh pipe under ’is
garden an’ then tap Government watter-
supply. All ’e does at night is turn a
little tap an’ flood ’is melons with stolen
watter.”
“Oh. oh, oh!” It was Martha Polglase
in hysterics, and as Thomas sank heavily to
a seat, Henry, with the voice of a prophet,
was heard declaiming. “Be sure yer sin will
find ’ee out,” while the band, to cover merci-
fully the scarlet sin of one of its followers,
broke into:
He took my sins away—away.
He took my sins away.

The Wind Raiser.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A DERELICT who had seen better days
was trying to raise the wind. The
situation was nothing new to her.
She thought of taking a header from the
pier end; but, being of unheroic fibre,
revolted from the vision conjured up, and,
instead, looked round for weapons with
which to stave off Death a little longer.
She interrogated the sideboard. No “silver”
shone upon it: its interior yielded no spark-
ling vintage—no haunch of venison. Its
cellaret was filled with last week's “dailies.”
and one cannot raise the wind with stale
news. A search of all pockets and bags
produced neither coin of the realm nor any-
thing convertible into cash. The Sahara
was not barer.
She consulted her purse once more. Like
Cassius, it had a lean and hungry look. She
sighed patiently as she laid Cassius down
again.
“The family jewels, I suppose,” she mut-
tered, and went to the coffers to collect the
gems. But, alas! some hand had already
scooped the pool—the gems had gone to
raise the hurricane at some previous crisis.
So then the Derelict scraped up the rem-
nants of bygone splendor—parts of a pen-
dant, ugly enough to have been genuine, a
dingy medal or two, her grandmother’s pearl
ring, bearing evidence of clumsy repair.
These she swept into the hungry purse, giv-
ing it quite an opulent curve.
She robbed the graphoplione of its ruby,
and, hardships having taught her philosophy,
rejoiced that she would be tortured no more
by its rendering of “My Goo-Goo Girl.”
She went on with her wind-raising prepara-
tions much heartened.
A second ring, an emerald, was planted
behind the mirror. A thief would have
needed second sight among his house-break-
ing tools to have unearthed it, yet the Dere-
lict decided to take it as well. To deter-
mine whose property the ring was would
have needed a judge and jury. It had
been left behind by a boarder who departed
by stealth. He had previously stated—to
account for so magnificent a stone being
in the possession of a seedy person in a
ninety-shilling suit —that he was “minding”
it for his mate who had mysteriously
HER, OUTLOOK.
MR. NEWLYWED: “I team you, my dear, that
I can only afford necessities.”
MRS. NEWLYWEN : “ That’s right, love. Let’s
only worry about the milliner and dress-
maker, and let-the horrid tradesmen go.”
“found” it. Had the emerald, found
gleaming from the dust of his bedroom floor
after his departure, been left in payment
of his board bill? The Derelict wanted to
know. In that case it was hers wherewith
to raise the wind, and it pleased her.
In the uncertainty of the situation, she
placed it on her finger under her glove for
safety.
From a wardrobe she took a dress-coat,
also the heliotrope silk in which she had
danced with a local mayor, and putting
these into a suit-case and herself into
goggles and a black veil, she set forth looking
like Lady Isabel heading for the back door
of East Lynne.
In a distant suburb where the sun raised
blisters on the asphalt she halted. The

“ We've got a new motor-car—a bigger one than yours.”
“Yah! We’ve got a snake under our garage.”
pavement, to her goggled vision, wavered
fantastically, and the black veil flew round
her head like some ill-omened fowl.
Before her stared a sign:—
Ladies and Gents.’ Wardrobes Bought.
Trousseaus Complete in Every Detail Provided.
Oh, shabby and pitiable bride who would
resort hither for plumage!
The Derelict entered the shop. “As well
sell the coat and dress at once,” she thought,
and laid the suit-case on the counter with
confidence.
It was a tiny place, flapping with old
skirts, wilted hats, shapeless trousers, and
umbrellas in broken-ribbed bunches. A
foreign person, who looked as though but
just returned from egging on a bull-fight in
old Madrid, came to the fore.
She spoke no English, but her earrings
swung, and her eyes flashed in rejection of
the proffered kit. She would have none of
it, and insolently shrugged her shoulders to
her ears. On the other hand, she showed
remarkable affability and determination in
trying to .saddle the Derelict with another
silken gown, tawdry and spotted with the
remains of good living.
To avoid staying to buy where she had
come to sell, the vendor h..u to gather up her
suit-case and run for it. followed to the door
by the barraeker of bull-fights, most insistent
that she purchase, for hard cash, an old
umbrella at least.
Disheartened by this first effort as a sales-
lady, she timidly unrolled the heliotrope silk
at the next counter. A heavy-jawed woman
there decried it. also the coat.
“Hellyertrope’s s o
unsaleable.” she said.
“They're all fer tango
now. or yaller. Oh,
no, it ain’t worth it!”
She shuddered at the
exorbitant price asked,
and pushed the silk
rudel.v from her as
though it had been a
death-adder; and so
great was her repug-
nance to the goods, the
vendor and the whole
scheme o f creation,
that she withdrew
parlorwards and was
seen no more.
Th e Derelict, o n
the track again,
wished herself dead,
and tried'to work up
enough courage to
pitch herself under-
neath a motor, or at
least to pitch the
heliotrope there.
But nrudenee or cowardice once more pre-
vailed, and from rag-shop to dealer, from
dealer to rag-shop, journeyed the silk
which had once been clasped in the arms
of the Mayor.
The “old clo’ ” warehousemen were unani-
mous in declining to buy, and the owner soon
decided that “Wardrobes Bought” was but
a figure of speech. Swarthy men and
Avomen they were, with rapacious mouths,
who, bored and supercilious, would, at the
close of her peroration, yawn like hyenas,
disclose gold-filled teeth and say “Buyer
out,” “Buyer at lunch,” or “Buyer at a
funeral.” Elusive person, the buyer, one
difficult to buttonhole; and a hard man
withal, who would behead without a trial
any member of his firm who bought even to
the value of a thrum in his absence.
Some dealers were more humane in their
turning-down methods. One, seizing the
garments, went behind a screen and held a
conversation with someone supposed to be
seated there. Returning, she piled the re-
jects upon their owner, saying quickly.
“Mrs. Left-off’s sorry, but she’s overstocked
at present.”
Another was affable, but hard as nails.
Taking the Derelict into her confidence, she
explained that the public had an unaccount-
able loathing for heliotrope silks. Had it
been a blue silk, now, or a pink cloth, even,
it would have sold like beer on a hot day.
Or had it been a crushed-cabbage morning-
gown, or again had the helio been striped
with “old tomato,” or patterned with “storm
grey,” it would have just filled a vacant lot
in the public’s affections. Why, everyone
knew how the fashionable loved these vivid
tonings! Warming to her theme, she
evolved such a color riot that the noise of
it drove the Derelict once more to the track.
“Dash !” said she, cramming the silk into
the suit-case. “The only thing saleable in
that shop would be a chameleon. As for
you ” —to the dress-coat—“if you were grass-
green with a shower of golden stars down
your back, you would still be a stayer.”
Luck, smiling Luck, met her upon the
doorstep of Mulvaney, Outfitter. Mulvaney !
Why, the very name was promising. Why
had she not found this emigrant from “Carle”
earlier ?
Miss Mulvaney. pretty and glib, was be-
hind the counter.
“Ccr-tainly, I’ll look at it,” she answered
graciously at the Derelict’s meek request.
“It” was the heliotrope silk making a last
bid, and Miss Mulvaney might have been
Royalty granting an audience to some loyal
crossing-sweeper, so condescending her man-
ner.
“Certainly, yes. Mother is wanting cos-
tumes, I think Oh-h-h! O-h-h !” she
cooed, as the parcel was unrolled. “A little
heliotrope—the dearest little helio—and
we’re wanting helios —such a scarce shade
—it’s really sweet. I like the little basque,
don’t you?”
The Derelict’s heart rose like an airship.
Eureka! She lmd achieved the apparently
impossible. She had raised the wind. In
her relief she almost wept.
Miss Mulvaney purred over the silk and
pawed it caressingly.
“And what were you asking for it?” she
said. “Oh, that’s very reasonable! Well, I
will take it. Mother usually does the buy-
ing, but she’s out now—gone to the doctor’s.
She’s not very well, you know.” (Polite
interest shown in Mother’s health from the
other side of the counter. The Derelict could
afford to commiserate.)
“Yes,” continued Miss Mulvaney; “I
think Mother would approve of the little
pink frock —I should mean the little blue —
I should say the helio— Oh-h!” She gave a
little horrified scream and dramatically
clutched her hair as she pulled out the till.
“Mother’s taken all the cash with her!
Yes” —as she felt the empty bowls —“ every
shilling! Why, she hasn’t even left me a
penny for an ice-cream. So I won’t be able
to buy the little heliotrope, after all. Oh,
I’m sorry! It’s so awfully sweet, such a
cunning little panel. But as Mother hasn't
left me any change— Good morning!”
Almost before the Derelict has staggered
to the open, Miss Mulvaney is shrilling to
Mother, comfortably reading within, “Oh,
only a dowdy old silk, Ma. No good to me.
Shall I go to the butcher’s now?” She dives
into the real till (a basin behind a pile of
trousers) and sails away to the man of meat.
The Derelict was “sporting.” She knew
when the silk had got the knock-out blow.
No more would she offer it for sacrifice.
Now it was the turn of Cassius. He should
disgorge his gems. To the Golden Balls then
without more ado.
Pawnshops pawnshops. She was in
the pawnshop zone. Like some contagious
disease, they spread on every hand.
From those blazing with plate-glass and
cruets she chose one, old and dirty, for upon
its pane ran the legend, “Old gold and jew-
ellery bought.” Yes, here was a market for
the ruby and the heirlooms. She hesitated,
looked casually in, strolled casually past,
stepped back, and finally slid on to the pre-
mises as though by accident.
Dark and musty, the place seemed empty,
but no! Like a spider in the web an ancient
Jew was lurking there. A Jew, so old and
withered, he might have Hed from Pharaoh’s
hosts across the Red Sea. His face was
yellow and pink in patches, like a map. His
lower lip hung out like that of a very old
horse. His eyes had an addled look like an
egg too long laid, save for the pin-point
pupils in which dwelt all the knowledge and
cunning of the whole Semitic race, ’way
back to Issachar.
He turned his eyes upon the woman who
wished to raise the wind. Before the pent-
up knowledge within them, the soul of the
Gentile shrank. What! How could she
hope to impose the heirlooms on such a
master of craft! She wasn’t having any,
and would have backed out had not the
Hebrew mesmerised her with his eye. She
fell into a waking dream, her eyes resting
upon the old sets of teeth which grinned
maliciously from the shelf, and heard him
as a lullaby : “Vat can I do for you, please?”
His eye appraised her and the lean purse..
“You vand a loan—an advanze? I lend on
zecurity-—your husband, has he steady em-
ployment? I lend on his job, I lend on fur-
-r-niture, on piano, on gramophone”
“Gramophone?” she cried. He spread his
hands and smiled evilly. “Gramophone?”
she repeated. “Yes; I wish to sell a ruby.”
He examined the alleged jewel through a
magnifier.
“Glass!” he said. “I vill not lend on
glass. I vill moundt it for you—yes, in
ster-r-ling silver, and make hatpin—elegant
- —but lend? No, no !”
She proffered her store. The pendant was
dismissed with contempt. “1 can get those
pendant with coupon ticket from a penny-
slot machine —from a prize-packet. Huh! I
sell pendant, but buy! No, no. Medals?
No. Give them to the gas man —nod to
me!”
The grandmother’s pearl ring awoke his
interest. He turned it about in his skinny
claw, and his eyes were so covetous that
the Derelict feared lest his palm, seemingly
furnished with some adhesive quality, would
stick to the ring altogether. She knew it to
be of value, yet he decried it.
“This ring you wish to sell? Pooh!” He
shrugged his shoulders. “No, no ! I am a
business man, I do not buy rubbish.”
“Rubbish !” echoed she.
“I vill repair-r it, but it vill cost you
money. You are avar-re the r-rihg has been
repair-red before?” He raised his crafty
eyes.
“Often,” she answered faintly; “but I
don’t want it mended now —it’s my fortune
that wants repairing.”
The Jew ignored her. He wanted the
ring and did not intend to buy it. “Often
repair-red ; yes, and by the plumber, I should
say, vith lead like he uses for the kitchen
seenk. Now I vill do the chob properly”
“How much will you charge?” she asked,
thinking it wise to humor him.
“It vill cost you money.”
“How much?”
“Not so fast! Not so fast!” He shot
cold reproach at her as she spoke. “I am
explain, if you please. This r-ring I repair
vith goot materials. I make a goot chob.
These pear-rls I vill replace with genuine
stones.”
“What? Are those not genuine pearls
then? They belonged to my grandmother,
and she was a—she would not wear shams.
Surely you are wrong!”
“I am never wrong,” went on Issachar
relentlessly. “These pearls are wax-filled —
the setting is old —obsolete. I vill make
you a new ring”——
“No! No ! I don’t want a new one. I
want my old ring, my grandmother’s.”
“You shall have the same r-ring,’’ he
replied coldly; “your gr-randmother’s r-ring,
certainly, but made vith new goldt, new
pear-rls and new diamondt chip.”
He let this paradox sink into the con-
fused brain of his hearer, and continued:
“But it vill cost you money.”
“How much?” she cried.
“Eighteen-carat goldt, 14 pear-rls and a
small diamondt chip for” he paused.
She hung breathless, awaiting the horrid
total.
“For seven-an’-six.”
“What!” cried the Derelict. She had
scented frying flatliead in Pharaoh’s kitchen.
The fumes rose to her head. “What? Four-
teen pearls and a fish and chips for seven-
and-six ! Too cheap! Too cheap,! Give
me back my ring—my grandmother’s ring!
Some other day I will call for the 14 fish
and the diamond chip. I am too hungry
now. I must go —for lunch—for fish and
chips!”
She tore off her gloves and mopped her
face with them, and snatched the pearl ring
from the unwilling claw of Pharaoh. For
the first time the eye of that ancient lit
on the emerald. He stiffened, his nose
snuffed the air. He became solicitous.
“You are faint, madam,” he said. “Br-ring
a chair. Isidore. The lady is faint. Queeck,
queeck!”
A hook-nosed clerk led the Derelict to a
chair in an inner office, lowered her into it
and allowed her to lose consciousness.
Then the pawnshop woke up. Pharaoh
took the emerald from the Derelict’s finger
and ran his down the Stolen Property List.
The emerald coincided exactly with one re-
ported missing. Then Pharaoh locked the
suspect in. Isidore rang up the police sta-
tion. And when she who wished to raise
the wind regained her senses, she found her-
self under arrest for theft, and about to
sample the terrors of the third degree as
wielded by Constable McGee.
MOLESKIN.


BILLY BLUE GUM’S CHRISTMAS TREE.


A Bit Flighty.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MRS. FLYNN generally had a bit of a
chat when she did my room out.
Her chat was all-embracing; she
had a fine range of subjects, but only one
in which she was really interested—her
daughter and her daughter’s qualities.
“She’s a good girl, Mr. Brien, but she’s
like these Australian girls, you know—
a bit flighty,” was her slogan. “Making good
money she is, but every penny of it goes on
her back, barring my 10 bob fer ’er keep.
White shoes an’ stoekin’s and what not—l
never seen white shoes when I was ’er age.
An’ a boy to take ’er out —a diff’rent one
every night, as like as not.” Lots of things
she told me, leaning on her broom. “It’s all
pictures an’ ice-cream an’ cake, an’ next
week to take care of itself all the year
round. It’s flashy, that’s what it is, Mr.
B.; but Gawd knows ’er troubles ’ll come
soon enough—l never see no ’arm in a bit
o’ fun, if yer can afford it.”
It hadn’t seemed to occur to Mrs. Flynn
that white shoes and their attendant “flashi-
ness” were a questionable preparation for
the “troubles” when they did come. I often
wondered what would happen when oqe of
the boys made it a permanency. I went so
far as to ask Mrs. Flynn what she thought
of the possibilities in that situation.
“Oh, well, girls w r ill be girls, yer know,”
was her solution ; “it’s no good meetin' yer
troubles before yer get to ’em.”
Later, action came into the hitherto
monotonous drama of Maudie.
“Yes, ’e’s a nice young feller, just ’er
sort —he’s Australian, too !—free with ’is
money an’ that; ’e’s bought ’er a lovely
ring.”
1 congratulated.
“What / said was, ‘Why don’t yer buy
something sensible with the money?’—what’s
the good of live diamonds, Mr. B.?” Mrs.
Flynn’s reserved, courageous eyes looked
almost tragic. “But that’s ’is style. ‘The
best is good enough fer me,’ ’e says. I ain’t
one to grumble at a bit o’ luck, but”
Mrs. Flynn looked thoughtfully at her
duster without finishing her sentence.
Some three or four months later I gave
Mrs. Flynn a horrible plush-bordered repro-
duction of “The Maiden’s Prayer” with my
good wishes for the bride. She was embar-
rassing in her gratitude. “Oh, thank yer
very much, Mr. B. Ain’t it lovely? Think of
that on the wall of ’er drawin’-room.” Mrs-v
Flynn’s fine face fell into a momentary
gravity. “There’s one thing bothers me a
bit. ’ls father’s got a bit o’ land up-country,
an’ ’e’s ’ad a cottage built there, an’ given
the ’ouse an’ land to young Bert fer a wed-
din’ present. Bert’s all right—men always
is—but Maudie an’ 'er white shoes an’
stockin’s don’t seem to fit the country.”
Mrs. Flynn looked at me as if she hoped
I could prophesy. I couldn’t; but I did my
best with plain reassurance.
“Well, p'r’aps so, Mr. Brien ; I’m sure I
’ope so. But thank you again for the lovely
picture: Maudie’ll just love it.”
I shuddered, and thought that she would.
I heard no more of Maudie and her
“troubles” in my six years in the Melbourne
office. Sometimes Mrs. Flynn’s chats crossed
ray memory, and I wondered vaguely if the
troubles had
been ins u r-
mountable, i f
there were any
little Maudies
and what they
looked like on
the basis of the
“pictures an’
ice-cream a n’
cake” prepara-
tion for little
Maudies and
Berts. M y
Melbourne term
ended, I was
qualified, a c-
cording to the
office tradition,
for the “road,”
my first, district being the
Hawkesbury. The station-
master, listening perfunctor-
ily to my bitter complaints of
his wantonly uncertain and
practically non-existent
freight-trains, had a yarn of
one of the fettlers some time
ago—a pathetic yarn, as he
put it. Through the clouds
of my helpless indignation it
finally penetrated.
“Young Bert was all right
—a bit flash and fond of the
races, but all right. The
light engine in front of 84
came through a bit late” (I
could believe that easily)
“and ’e missed ’er. Eighty-
four ’ad made up a bit, and
in the wind ’e couldn’t ’ear
’er. Any’ow, she was on ’im
before he c’d think ; an’, run-
nin’ off the way, ’e slipped
on the couplin’s and fell. . . .
cut both ’is legs off as clean
as a whistle. ’ls kid, young
Maudie, brought ’is dinner
to the ’alf of ’im lyin’ there before we c’d
stop ’er at the gates”....
The name-coincidences were real evidence;
it was Maudie, whose troubles seemed to
have got going pretty thoroughly. Mrs.
Flynn, I learned, had had a stroke and was
permanently bedridden in Maudie’s house;
so I went down the track to have another
“bit of a chat” with her.
Maudie answered my call. In the slant-
ing sunlight I could see nothing but cheerful
vigor in the kindly, handsome eyes of the hag-
gard, work-worn girl, tired and indomitable.
“Ma? Oh, yes—she’d be glad to see you.
What name shall I say? Brien—righto;
I’ll go and fix ’er if you’ll wait a minute.”
Mrs. Flynn looked a good deal more than
the six years older. As Maudie had said,
she seemed glad to see me in the spick-and-
span front room with my regrettable
“Maiden’s Prayer” on the wall.
“Yes, I ’ad to give in when the stroke
came. Maudie ’ad me bed put in ’ere. an’
’ere I am till the undertaker comes,. Mr.
B. It’s a nice little place she’s got ’ere,
isn’t it? All that trellis work Bert put up,
an’ the wash-’ouse lean-to by the kitchen —
you’d be surprised ’ow 'e gets on with that
bit of a box on w’heels; ’e turns ’imself
wonderful, an’ ’e’s never still —always at
work about the place.”
Through the open window I heard a curi-
ous hollow rumbling, as of a child’s cart.
Presently round the corner the half of a
young man came, seated on a little flat car-
riage with iron wheels. The thing jolted
him considerably, but he was very intent
on whatever work he had in view, and didn’t
seem to notice secondary discomfort. He
propelled himself quite rapidly by pushing
the gravel-path with his hands.
“ ’E’s built the wash-’ouse by makin' ’im-
self baby-scaffolds, as ’e calls ’em, an' put-
tin’ slantin’ planks to ’em; it was all right
till ’e got up too ’igh. but Maudie ’elped
’im with the roof. O’ course. Maudie's got
a lot to do with four children an’ Bert an'
me ’elpless on ’er ’ands ; but she always was
one o’ the ’appy-go-lucky ones, thank Gawd.
It’s a good thing Bert can get about the
’ouse an’ place like ’e can, ’im not earnin’,
an’ young Maudie bein’ not right in ’er ’ead
since she saw ’er father after the train
went over ’im.” Mrs. Flynn paused and
sighed. “But tiie luck ain’t always good.
Last year she an’ ’im put in a tomato crop
to catch the early market. The neighbors
buy all ’e can grow, but this was to get a
bit o’ money 7 fer a chair for ’im. the one
’e made joltin’ ’im so an’ cuttin’ ’is ’ands
about on the stones.” •• Mrs. Flynn sighed
again. “Lord, ’ow 'im an’ Maudie worked
with them plants—worse than a young
family they was, what with the forcin’ bed,
an’ plantin’ ’em out when they was big
enough, an’ watchin’ ’em an’ coddlin’ ’em—
’oein’ an’ weedin’ an’ waterin’ from sunrise
to dark. They were a week late for the first
market With ’em, but they got ’em all packed
—them cases cost something, on top o’ the
plants an’ all the work —an’ up to the sta-
tion/’ Mrs. Flynn’s eye lit up in the falling
dusk, and her voice grew a little stronger.
“And on the station they stayed three days
an’ nights till the freight-train remembered
to come ’ere an’ pick ’em up.” The indig-
nant eyes faded again, and the voice came
down to its normal pitch. My own dreary
freight difficulties crossed my mind. “Ari’
Mr. Giotti give Bert nothin’ for the first
pickin’—damaged, ’e said it. was. An’ the
other pickin’s only cleared expenses—the
early market ’ad gone. So ’e never got ? is
chair.”
My quarrel with the railway was becom-
ing personal in two places.
A sound of singing, children’s voices and
a tired contralto, came from the direction
of the kitchen. I looked up. “That’s Maudie
an’ the children; she gives ’em a bit o’
practice for the school concert every night
before she puts ’em to bed. She always was
one fer enjoyment, as I used to tell yer,
Mr. B. —a bit flighty-like.”

It was the dead waste and middle of the
night. I was awakened by a tumult of light
more startling than the tearing crash of
immediate thunder, or the world-deafening
roar of a hundred great guns. It was a light
so poignant that it stunned the sense and
I saw nothing with my oppressed and fear-
surprised eyes. The glare in the room
blinded me to all the familiar obieets, and
I was conscious only of an effulgent wall,
with a sputtering centre throwing out white
sparks., and working within itself with a
sort of molecular action.
Not till I had recovered
from th e bewilderment
and faint nausea that
this incandescent glow
provoked was I able to
define his shape, and then
only as a keener bril-
liance within this unpre-
cedented lustrousness.
I sat up in my bed.
shading my eyes. Then
recollecting my amber
glasses on the chair, I
put them on. The glasses
enabled me to look more
narrowly, but still it
seemed that if I con-
tinued so to stare my
eyeballs might be charred
in their sockets. All the
time I was conscious of
suffocating, and of intol-
erable heat endured past
ordinary human bearing.
“Angels and ministers
of grace, defend us!” I
murmured.
What I saw of him
wan . a ghost of light
within an inconceivable
resplendence. But his
form became distinct to
me, and it was not un-
familiar. I knew that
lofty dome, that width
of brow, those large,
sagacious orbs, that
somewhat effeminate face
terminating in a short,
pointed beard. Was it Ilall
Caine in fancy costume?
“The apparel oft pro-
claims the man, but who
are you?” I whispered.
“Art thou a spirit of
health, or goblifn
damned?”
He recoiled. “I am
one of the damned.” said
he. “I am out enjoying
a temporary remission
for good behavior. At
least, I imagined that to
be the idea. Now I
have my doubts. Re-
cognising in you a sym-
pathetic soul, I have
come to confide.”
He seated himself on
the foot of my bed.
“I have not confided in
anyone since my death,”
he continued. “We are
not gregarious in Hell
You can understand why
I am now emitting a
light of eleven million
candle-power, though I
am on lowest pressure; and at the
present moment I am radiating heat
at such a rate that the figures would
not be comprehensible to you. Did I not
arrange for the heat to flow off through the
open windows your house and all its occu-
pants would be incinerated in five seconds.
l T ou can understand what the assembling of
millions of such sources of light >a.nd heat,
many of them more active than rayggjf,
would mean to this universe.
“Then what and where is Hell?” I asked
faiteringly. “Are thy intents wicked or
charitable?”
"In some respects,” said he, “your astro-
nomical ideas are profoundly ridiculous. The
so-called Milky Way is Hell so far as Hell
has a location. The Way is composed of
untold millions of souls, each blazing as I
am, each a hell within himself. ‘Every man
his own hell’ expresses the situation in
popular phraseology.”
As I saw him now more clearly and
familiarly in the moments during which I
permitted myself to open my eyes, I per-
ceived that the region of his heart was the
centre, the nucleus, of his heat and light.
Here the fulgidity was at its height, burn-
ing with a fierceness too intense for any
earthly comparison, sputtering myriads of
infinitesimal sparks, each of which might
have lit up a town, dazzlingly white, each
spark splintering as it flew, and casting out
millions more, snow-white and coruscant.
“Do you feel it?” I asked in quavering
awe.
He nodded. “It is Hell,” he said.
“And do the damned never burn out?”
“Possibly they do, but I have known no
instance of it, and I have been in Hell
since the year 1616, over 300 years. I was
when I died a celebrated author of fiction ;
I have since, I find, become something in
the nature of a god. Of course I was not
permitted to forget in Hell, but I must say
it was a grievous disappointment to me to
find on returning that I was not to be per-
mitted to forget on earth. For instance, it
was my bitter bad fortune almost imme-
diately after setting foot on earth to find
myself in contact with a society devised,
it would seem, for the worship of my poor
parts, and to discover that it was discussing
Hamlet.”
“Why, of course!” cried I —“ William
Shakspeare, the Bard of Avon! I must
apologise. I was mixing you up in my mind
with Hall Caine, of Avhom, perhaps, you
have heard.”
“Not yet,” he said wearily. “You cannot
imagine how tedious that fellow Hamlet be-
comes after 300 years. Still, I find you
people concerning yourselves with his
pranks, his foibles, his mental condition, his
tedious garrulousness. I have lived in
close contact with the poor fool for 301
years. No man born of woman could be
so provocative of soul-deadening ennui.”
“What. Hamlet in Hell?”
The shape nodded. “Where else should
he be? He is in Hell with me. They are
all in Hell with me. They are my only
associates. They are part of my Hell—
Hamlet, Lear, Juliet, Caesar, Antony, Shy-
lock.”
“Old Jack Falstaff. and Touchstone. Mer-
eutio and Jaques? Then you have no lack
of right good company !”

expressive of an everlasting woe, that I

‘Old Jack Falstaff!” he wailed. “Old
Jack ! Think of 300 years of Falstaff, sav-
ing the same deplorable things, straining
over the same wheezes, doing precisely as
he has always done, and try to think of a
more intolerable bore ! If
ton succeed it will be
melancholy Jaques who
will occur to you, or
those lamentable clowns
of mine. I have endured
Jaques and his wretched
Seven Ages speech all
these drear centuries. I
have had to put up with
Hamlet’s soliloquies, his
moralisings, his orations,
his fatuous philosophy,
his rantings, his mouth-
ing of ‘To be or not to
be?’ every night, every
day, every hour of my
sojourn in Hell. All that
time I have had a troop
of pestilent fools —Touch-
stone, the nurse from
‘Romeo,’ Abram, Gregory,
Sampson, Rosenerantz,
Guildenstern. Sly,
Grumio, Dull, Costard,
Launcelot Gobbo, Audrey,
Dogberry and scores of
others, dogging my heels,
mouthing drear inepti-
tudes. I have put up
with the roarings of Pet-
rucio, the boosy wit of
Toby Belch, the absurd
affectations of Portia, the
madness of Ophelia, the
uxorious Moor’s barbaric
concupiscence, and there
is the true horror of Hell,
unending and preposter-
ous tedium!”
“But is the creation of
these magnificent charac-
ters held to be part of
your sin?”
“There is no discover-
able purpose or motive in
Hell, no visible authority,
no malignant head. Pos-
sibly it is a condition of
the immutable law that
the misbegotten things
shall cling to their crea-
tor as some part of him,
and be damned with him.
Possibly every man
peoples his own hell as
I have peopled mine. But
no other man, I think,
has surrounded himself
with so dreadful an
array. And to this there
is no end.”
“Bear up, man,” I
said. “Remember —•
True hope is swift, and flies
with swallow’s wings,
Kings it makes gods, and
meaner creatures kings.”
“Refrain l” He almost screamed the word.
“Is there no escape? I came back seeking
respite. Obscuring my forces, I have stolen
unseen and unfelt among men, and every-
where here it is as there. Here, in hall
and church and theatre, I am minded every
moment of that bastard family of mine.
Hamlet is quoted at me in Japan. lam con-
fronted with Benedick speeches in darkest
Africa. There is no hope, no hope—here
is- hell upon earth. Here walk Shallow and
Slender, Sir Hugh Evans, Bardolph, Pistol
and Nym, Mrs. Quickly, Ague-Cheek, Mal-
volio and Maria, Quince, Snug and Bottom,
and the endless run of chattering women,
and, horror of horrors! you have all become
in some measure part of my illegitimate
brood, talking with their tongues, aping
their airs and graces, thinking their thoughts!
I wonder have I deserved Hell for the ill
inflicted upon mankind in thus tincturing
thought and action with the. taint of idolatry
and the shame of endless plagiarism.”
“ ‘There is no ill, but thinking makes it
so, ” said I.
He cried aloud. “Man. man,” said he, “I
have peopled a world with parrots!”
It was a cry of utter despair. He went
straight from the room, and darkness fell like
a blow across the eyes. A moment later and
the house was in flames. We extinguished
the fire, but I found a hole burnt through
the front door, exactly his size and shape,
and up the stairs and about my room were
many human footprints burned deeply into
the timber of the steps and the floor.
Knowing what I know of Hell, would I
lie to you?

The Simple Solution.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
THE pup was growing up. lie had been
Over six months in the army now.
“Look at the way his ears are begin-
ning to prick,” Lofty said one day to the
others of the gun's crew. “I tell yoU lie's
going to he ode of the best sheepdogs ever
pupped. We'll see him handling his 20,000
mob of sheep one of these days, with not
another dog to help him and his boss just
looking on. Won’t we, Wilga? Eh, boy?”
He had never been much of a favorite
with the battery. Lofty had seen to that ever
since the night he had smuggled him aboard
the trahsport. “A remembrance from my old
mate Up country,” Lofty had said as he put
his hand in the pocket of his great-coat. His
new mates had crowded round and watched
the small black-and-tan thing creep shivering
and whimpering across the mess table.
“What a little beauty!” someone had ex-
claimed and leant over to play with him.
“Here, pup, are you ticklish?”
“None of that—nor from any of you,”
Lofty had growled. “Do you want to spoil
him on me? You've heard the heads say
that too much play is no good to train sol-
diers on. Well, it's the same with training
dogs that have to work sheep for a living.
So keep your hands off him, all of you.”
They had lately come over to France. Life
aboard ship and in England had made little
impression on the pup. But he still remem*
ber e d to avoid
the sergeant-major.
The sergeant-
major was the one
who on their last
morning at sea
caught him by the
neck and carried
him to the rail,
where, far below,
waters sucked and
swirled.
“Here, put him
down!” Lofty
yelled, forgetful of
all rank at the
dog's howl.
“He’s to go over-
board,” the ser-
geant-major d e-
clared. “Orders are
that mascots can’t
land in England.”
“M ascot be
!” Lofty re-
plied. “That dog
is a working dog.”
The battery-
major came on
deck just then.
He was a sheep-
man himself back
i n Australia, o r
perhaps he would
not have heeded
Lofty’s appeal—
“ The dog’s not a
mascot, sir. Any-
one can see he’s
just a plain work-
ing kelpie.”
“Well, what’s he
doing here?” the
Major asked. “A
20,000 acre pad-
dock is the place
for him.”
“I brought him
along so as I could
train him to my
ways for when I
go back home,”
Lofty told him. “I thought a bit of army
discipline would be good for him.” -
“All right. Let him go,” the commanding
officer said, nodding over to the sergeant-
major.
The pup was a dog now. Lately he had
given up looking for things to play with. He
was beginning to take a serious interest in
life.
The battery had not been in action yet,
but it was held always ready to move up as
soon as the order came. In these days the
dog used to sit by the horse-lines and watch
the men cleaning and polishing, bewildered
by this new feeling of alertness that had come
over everything. He felt a strange unrest
within himself, too, that kept him always
wondering.
And he had only to look over towards the
road to be further perplexed. There he could
see columns of men passing up and down
for hours at a time, horses sometimes, and
often team after team dragging guns and
waggons. Yet this steady movement of great
numbers, the rising clouds of dust, the
horses, the calls and whistles, all seemed
familiar somehow.
At these times he would look over to
Lofty grooming a horse, wag his tail and
give a little whine of impatience. “What’s
up. Wilga?” Lofty would say. “Want to
be mustering them, eh? Never mind, old
boy. One of these days we’ll be going up
a 10,000-acre paddock with a 20,000 flock of
sheep all to ourselves, and not give a damn
for sergeant-majors or anybody.” And Wilga
would thump the ground with his tail and
whine half-delightedly, half-doubtfully.
One evehing wlieri they cbuld still hear the
rumbling find growling that had been going
on away up the road for the last two days, ti
grey eolumii Came passing in. "Fritz
prisoners!” Someone shouted. “We’re get-
ting them all right this Offensive.” The
dog started to his feet and stood, one front
paw lifted off the ground, tense. Ilis eyes
swept questibningiy from the ranks Of grey
to Lofty's face and eagerly back again. His
tail wagged briskly, and his voice kept up
a low whine of impatience.
“That’s not mutton. Heel, Wilga, heel!”
Lofty told him. Then thrning to his mates
standing by he said, “All the shine, if the
heads knew anything they’d have a couple
of hundred kelpies like Wilga in the army.
They wouldn’t want armed escorts then to
bring prisoners down from the lines. I’ll
bet two kelpies would take a inob of Fritzes
wherever they were wanted, and not lose one,
and yard tip the officers separate from the
privates and all.”
All that night the road sounded With the
tread of men and horses —but going tip in
the other direction now. Next morning the
battery itself was all bustle and began draw-
ing out towards the roadway. “We’re off
to the firing-line this time all right,” Lofty
told the dog as he climbed into a saddle of
the team he was a driver of. “We'll soon
know what all the trouble is about up there,
eh. old boy?”
Wilga whined up at him understandingly.
The battery had been out on marches before,
but this was the first time that he had not

been carried across Lofty s saddle or in the
limber, lie felt the same eagerness to be oil
as the men. But true sheepdog that he was
he did not express it with a bark. Ahead
the Major’s horse was prancing and the lean-
ing team was entering a break m the col-
umn on the road. There was some excite-
ment in this life, after all. W ith a jei
Loftv’s team started forward. Ihe dog
fell hack and watched. Then all at once he
realised that he must follow —that Lofty
was moving away and that he must alwajs
be bv him. With the knowledge came a
great happiness. As he fell into a trot by
Lofty's horse he felt that here was a part
of the answer to the riddle of life, anyway.
Towards noon he was limping a little, but
he did not once look up for sympathy.
“That’s the way! Stick it out, W llga.
Lofty said. “Your mother never gave in
once, even though we’d been six months on
the road, with the track all sticks and burrs
and the sheep always breaking for grass.
They halted for the midday meal on the
outskirts of a French village. A batch ot
fowls came straggling down the resting col-
umn picking up crumbs here and there. »_ud-
denly a small black-and-tan dog stood before
them. The fowls knew other dogs, but this
one looked almost friendly, standing with
one paw lifted, wagging his tail there. Still,
he had a masterful air about him. tlalt-
afraid they came to a stop, but the dog still
stood tense, his ears pricked, listening. It
came — a whistle from Lofty. The dog moved
forward a few feet. Wonderingly, but with-
out alarm, the fowls turned about and began
straggling away. Then dashing quietly from
one flank to another the dog marshalled them
into a compact flock and drove them along
down the road.
Another whistle came. He raced round
and stood before them again. As soon as
they had got over their surprise he was on
their flank and urging them through the gap
between two gun teams. There he got an-
other signal. At once he turned them again,
stijl without getting them into ii panic; and
brought them up the Other side of the guns
and horses; and at a final whistle through to
where Lofty stood. “It's the breed,” the
driver said as he pdtted the dog On thg head.
"Won’t old Jim be pleased when I Write
home and tell him about the pup he gttve
hie!”
The Major rode up as the order cdme to
mount. “Bettet keep that dog Of yoUrS off
these French poultry,” he told Lofty.
“But he won’t touch them, sir,” the drivel 1
replied.
“I know that,” the Major said. “But he
will muster and work them to death, and
we’ll be getting bills for damages from all
over the country,
“All right, sir,” Lofty assented. “But
any time yoh want a poultry dinner just let
me know, and he’ll bring a batch of hens
right to your cookhoUse door, and not a sound
from him or them.”
Cantering on that afternoon, as they
turned a bend of the road Lofty saw the dog
come to a sudden stop, his ears pricked for-
ward. Lofty looked at the hillside ahead
where the dog’s excited eyes were fixed. A
small flock of sheep was grazing there, mov-
ing about in twos and threes. As the dog
watched them swarming ahd rolling over
the folds of the ground he quivered and
whimpered in delight. Then, as he caught
I.ofty’s eye. lie dashed through the hedge.
The whole battery watched as they saw him
race up the hillside and urge the Stragglers
to join the main flock. By the time Lofty
had ridden up he had them all moving along
together parallel With the road. Without
letting one break awav lie drove them along
at the same pace as the battery.
When they came to a dividing hedge Lofty
whistled, lie came in panting, feeling that
desires were now satisfied, happy that life
had shown him all its secrets at last.
But he was not so sure about everything a
few days afterwards. They were up now
where the growling and the rumbling was at
its loudest. There were guns crashing and
roaring all over the world, it seemed. Night
or day they never ceased. lie felt that he
wanted to get away from it all, but Lofty
persisted in staying.
At first when the battery or a nearby gun
opened up with the loudest crash of all he
raced round and round in his fright. Then
he would stand where he could watch in
bewilderment. But as they settled down to
continuous firing he would go and lie in a dug-
out, whining uneasily only when Lofty looked
over at him.
Gradually he grew used to it all. He
would watch the men loading and firing, and
straining and heaving, always about the gun.
They ate by it now, and they slept by it,
Lofty amongst them. Yet with all their
absorption in it the dog could sense that they
were ever on the alert for something he had
not seen yet—some unknown fear.
He wondered why they were all there.
Why did Lofty stay amongst all the
noise, working as never before, when they
could both be on a quiet hillside driving
sheep slowlv along? He would look over at
Lofty, but Lofty was too engrossed in piling
up shells to wonder about anything. So the
dog would fall asleep to dream the dreams
that cause sheepdogs to whimper softly in
their slumbers.
One afternoon his pricked ears a
new sound. It came like a whistle of Lofty s,
only much deeper. The men had heard it and
were rushing here and there or flattening on
the ground. The dog looked over to Lofty
for a sign, but he was cowering behind a
pile of boxes. Louder grew the whistle till
it became a scream. It ended on the. ground
nearby in a crashing roar, something like
when their own gun went off. He was used
to that by now; hut suddenly stones Und
clods were falling till around him —like they
did when the cooks chased him a\Vay from
their pots. With a yelp he turned and rusliec*
for the gunpit. A burst Of strain-relieved
laughter went up. “What breed is yohr dog
now, Lofty?” someone called.
“You all ducked before he did, anyway,”
Lofty replied proudly.
Sooh he came to take, as the men did, these
sudden whistles and alarms as the greatest
concern of life—but only at the time of their
coming.
But why all these futile whistles, he
wondered) when it was over. Why all
these peltings by invisible cooks when he was
not near a cookhouse? What was it all for.'
lie would look over to Lofty, but Lofty didn’t
seem to know either.
One evening he heard three of the whistles
coming together. Men were cowering and
scrambling away everywhere. Then all at
once the world about him was roaring and
shaking. Dazed and trembling with terror
he looked around for Lofty to fly to. Through
the smoke and dust he saw him lying face
downwards on the earth near the gun, and
rail .to him howling. There was a red blotch
on the back of his head, and his shoulders
were rising and falling. Gasping whistles
were coming from his throat.
“They’ve got old Lofty,” a man called.
Lofty was quite still when the Major came
round a few minutes afterwards. “Any
casualties that time?” he asked. “What —
Lofty King. .. .killed ! And we are going
back out of it to-night for a rest. We might
as well take him back a bit and give him a
decent burial in one of the little rest camps
down there.”
The dog followed them, wondering.
Lofty hadn't moved or spoken since. And
they had him
wrapped up in a
blanket now. lie
had never seen
horses au d me n
together move
quite so slowly
before.
They came to a
hillside with small
mounds dotted all
over it. White
an d huddled to-
getker, from a
long way off they
looked like a flock
of sheep grazing.
Beside one of them
a hole was dug and
into this men low-
ered Lofty. While
one of them stood
and spoke to the
others the dog sat
on a mound a little
way off, watching.
Then the trumpeter
stood out and
sounded a call that
made it seem like
night again. On
the last note, at a
command from the
sergeant-major, the
men fired their
rifles and turned
away. Before they
were out of sight
others began
shovelling earth
down on Lofty.
When the men
with the shovels
had gone the dog
came over. There
was a new white
mound. Lofty
was there beneath
it, he knew, but
what was the
meaning of it all?
Still, he was a
very young d o g.
He caught the
burial party up
just outside the
village. “Lost
y our maste r.
Wilga ?” one of
the men said as be
followed behind.
“O h, well, yo u
belong to the army
now.”
From out of a doorway a low-built yellow
dog appeared, lie caught sight of W ilga and
growled, baring his teeth. Instantly Wilga
forgot everything else —the hillside. Lofty and
all. That street was all the world and be
saw only one thing in it —a low-built, yellow-
dog. Along his spine the hair rose, and his
teeth showed. Then the yellow dog rushed
and Wilga felt his teeth in his shoulder.
In his first surprise he tried to shake him
off. but the dog held on. Then Wilga swung
his head round to get a grip, too, and the
men with the shovels stood round to see a
dog-fight.
Bleeding and quivering they led him away
a few minutes afterwards. "Ihose German
dachshunds can hang on, can’t they, Wilga i
a man said. “Never mind, keep on at it and
you’ll beat him one of these days, Aou re
only a pup yet.”
Wilga wagged his tail at the sympathy and
understanding in the soldier s voice. He
limped behind on three legs, sore but
strangely happy—happier than he could ever
remember being before.
Next morning he was out waiting by the
roadside, impatient for the battery to be
moving off. “They say we’re going round to
another sector to look for a scrap,’’ a man
was calling delightedly to his mate as they
w heeled their horses on to the roadway.
A flock of geese came waddling along, but
the dog’s vision went further than that. lie
was wondering if he w’ould meet the dachs-
hund along the road.
“Walk-march!” the Major called.
The horses pulled and the traces tautened.
Lofty, the sheep and all such dreams were
laid "by for a w-hile. There was some pur-
pose in this sort of life, after all, he thought,
as he fell into a trot beside one of the guns.
The road was long and you never knew
where you might meet a dog that wanted
fighting.
HARLEY MATTHEWS.


The Ballad of the King’s Whiskers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE threw his whiskers overboard.
And straightened up his tie;
Through rope and shroud the loud
wind roared
Beneath ail angry sky;
Although the sea was foamy-floored,
New light was in his eye.
The captain saw the island first,
A dim and distant speck.
His wrath appeared about to burst
In curses on .the deck ;
Those sharp rocks seemed the very worst
Whereon a ship might wreck.
But Jones stood there with shaven jaw
And watched the drowning hair
As if he joyed in all he saw
And found it very fair,
Although the wind was loud and raw
And shrieking with despair.
Jones’ whiskers bobbed along the wave,
The fishes round them played.
His heart was high, his soul was brave,
He could not feel afraid.
Though none was by who saw him shave,
He knew the ghosts w T ere laid.
For Jones had lately been a king
And played the dangerous game,
While revolutions rose to sing
Red songs without a name,
And knives to puncture anything
That wore a royal name.
He dropped his crown, he left his throne,
He threw his name away ;
But still his whiskers were his own —
A mat of red and grey—
Fierce emblems to the wide world known
Where tyranny holds sway.
And now the raging tempest rose.
Ah, little did he care
For each and every wind that blows
O’er oceans of despair,
Because from chin to happy nose
His face was clear of hair.
The captain worried where he strode
Along the heaving deck.
That island, standing in the road,
The ship’s straight course might check.
He said, “Such obstacles be blowed !
Prepare for death and wreck!”
The wreck occurred at two o’clock.
It was a frightful thing
To hear the thunder of the shock
And see the water spring
Right over captain, ship and rock,
And Jones who was a king.
Oh, Freedom walks erect and tall
By field and farm and town !
Her splendid voice is heard to call
Through pronoun, verb and noun ;
But where the great green combers fall
The seas are free to drown.
Jones sank about a mile or two;
Then through the salt-sea spray
He rose as corks and bubbles do
To look upon the day ;
And there he had a pleasant view
Of a small shingled bay.
He grasped a plank and floated in
At twenty-nine to five.
Around, the tempest raged like sin
With plunge and shout and dive;
So he was glad the land to win
And pleased to be alive.
Wet as the taste of brownest beer
And salt through all his bones.
With seaweed draped on either ear
He crawled across the stones—
Oh, dank it was and very drear,
The royal form of Jones.
But soon he leaped upon his feet
As some wild panther springs;
His happy heart began to beat,
His spirit found its wings—
He saw a building all complete
Marked "Shelter Here for Kings.”
He saw a broad and golden door
With eagles carved above.
Oh, let the proud stone emblems soar
Above the moulting dove!
Jones, standing on the cold, damp shore
Was filled with warmth and love.
He rang the bell with all his might.
A porter came with speed—■
“I am a king by royal right
Oast here in utmost need;
The ship that bore me in my flight
Is under wave and weed.”
The porter wore a heavy frown.
He gazed a weary while —
“A king may go without his crown—
It is the modern style—■
But none may take the drapings down
That deck the royal smile.
“Where are your whiskers? Seas are wide,
And loud are wind and wave,
But nowhere in the raging tide
By rock or shoal or cave
Are razors with the storm supplied
A monarch’s chin to shave.”
Jones groaned. “I threw them overboard,”
He said in his despair.
“About me in the wind they soared
And added to my care.
I felt that I could scarce afford
Such dignity of hair.”
The porter laughed. “An ancient tale,”
He said, “tliaj all repeat
When, hither blown before the gale,
They seek an inside seat.”
He banged the door: and Jones stood pale
Upon his cold, salt feet.
All night he wandered up and down
Beside the angry sea.
He thought about his ancient crown
And former majesty.
Of happy stout that once was brown
And even cakes and tea.
But when at last the morning came
With light on rock and palm,
lie saw the sun arise in flame
And, as the waves grew calm,
The glory of his former name
Seemed scarcely worth a damn.
For that long sweep of shining shore,
Where seas had ceased to rear,
Upon its stony bosom bore
A case of bottled beer,
Three crates of beef and goodly store
Of other forms of cheer.
And there, within a little pool,
lie paused a while to note
Some fishes small, a happy school,
That seemed to sport and gloat
Around broad whiskers, damp and cool,
Amid the weeds afloat.
“My beard !” he cried. “My royal beard !”
But here his pride took wing.
“With beer and beef and sunshine cheered,
Why should I be a king?”
A rag of crimson cloth he reared
Upon a stick and string!
And in the regal “Shelter” rose
An emperor or two.
Tremendous hair beneath each nose
In rolling splendor grew.
There, seeking breakfast ’mid their woes,
They found a thin, wet stew.
No liquor crowned a happy glass
For them for evermore;
They watched the weary seasons pass
Their barred and silent door:
Only their whiskers grew like grass
Until they swept the floor.
Afar, in cities loud with wheels,
Where Freedom stands and sings.
The poorest of the poor have meals ;
And someone lightly flings
A coin in answer to appeals
For old and faded kings.
But Jones was glad with beef and beer;
The red flag o’er him flew.
A safety-razor, sharp and dear,
Across his jaw he drew ;
And whiskerless from ear to ear
The Revolution grew!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
NOT THE SAME THING. REALLY.
FRIEND: “ Aren't you paying too much for this studio, old chap?"
ARTIST: “ Well , no; but I agree with you that the rent is too high.”
WE, Bill Smith and I, were riding
along a back-country road in the
far west of Queensland. We had
that morning passed through a township, and
the roofs of a station were peeping out of
the timber ahead, blurred by the dancing
mirage.
“Ever been along this road before t 1
asked.
“Along it! I know every tree; every bend
and stone,” Bill replied, looking keenly
ahead.
We rode on, and then Bill pulled his horse
back about half a length. I turned suddenly
and found him lifting his hat.
“What’s wrong?” I asked.
“Oh,” he replied, obviously embarrassed,
“just wanted to cool my head.’
It was a very lame excuse; still, I could
hardly press the matter then, but intended
to get the reason from him later. That
night while yarning at the fire I opened the
subject.
“You know this country well?” I started.
“Of course I know it: I’ve worked all
over it, and was years on that station we
passed this afternoon. Oh, blast it —it does
a man good to talk sometimes, so why
shouldn’t I open out? You saw me raising
my hat as I passed that beefwood tree. Well,
here’s the yarn.
“I told you I used to be working on that
station. I was a decent member of society
then : what you might call ‘quite fit for pub-
lication.’ I was head overseer there, and,
though I sav it myself, a damn smart fellow.
I’d have worked into a better billet in time,
but that wasn’t quick enough for me. I
wanted to get there; and the reason —well,
I’ll tell you.
“There was a girl came to stay at the
station, a visitor, and she was a gem. As
near perfect as you could get. I suppose
every man has an idea when he falls in love
with a girl that he and she were specially
cut out for one another. I didn’t think that
about her; I knew it. We sort of took to
one another from the word ‘Go,’ and it was
just passing that tree there, one day we
were out riding, that I told her what it
seemed to give her pleasure to hear.
"I say, have you ever held the one and
only in your arms and looked into her eyes,
and gradually, very gradually, let your lips
get closer and —oh, what’s the use? I’m
settled now; punctured in six places and
blown out. Still, a man has memories; but
it's hard to think of what might have been,
and what is. I wanted to marry straight
awav—anything to make her mine for keeps;
but she wouldn't have that at all.
“ ‘No,’ she said, ‘we must play the game,
and playing the game fair by ourselves comes
first. There may be a lot of people playing
the game, but somehow it always seems
harder when one has to do it oneself. Go
in and win,’ she said. ‘There will never be
anyone else.’
"Married overseers weren’t appreciated in
those days. I had money, so I bought a
droving plant, and, as I had a good name. I
reckoned it wouldn’t be too long before I’d
made enough to marry on.
“You’ve never been droving—eh? No?
Some men don’t know when they’re born
lucky. Whatever you do, don’t take on
droving. If ever you’re offered a job, and
the fellow tells you it’s droving—either sheep
or cattle, more ’specially cattle —run from
him. Pick up your feet and go. Take your
boots off, spit on your hands to keep your
feet from slipping; get your head down and
your ears back—pin ’em back to keep ’em
out of your eyes—and go. Pray to Old
Nick —he’s the father of droving and is the
old boy who hands out that sort of punish-
ment —pray to him, bribe him, promise him
anything, so long as he’ll not send you drov-
ing.’’
“It can’t be as bad as all that,” I re-
plied. “I've read some fine verses about
droving.”
“Yes, written by a bloke with a poet’s
license. That’s the polite way of saying
he’s got the right to tell any damn lie he
likes so long as he makes it rhyme.
Droving’s a fine life when the trip’s over
and you’ve just got your cheque. I could
write poems about it myself then.
“When I took it on—the time I’m telling
you of—l knew all about it and what it was
like, but I wanted money, wanted it bad.
Sheep were not too bad, even in those days,
and they’re easier now. We used to watch
at night in those times. Now they ring ’em
right in every night, and watching’s cut
out altogether, except on real stormy nights
with bad winds. There’s one thing about
sheep—you take ’em out about sunrise, you
have ’em in bed about sundown ; and, even
in my days, what were a couple of hours’
watch at night? There’d only be a gap of
about 30 or 40 yards, the men’d be camping
along that, and dogs tied up as well, and all
the watcher had to do was take a walk round
every now and again.
“I liked this watching. A couple of hours
in the middle of the night, when all was
quiet, gave a man a fine time to think, and
I had something to think of.
“I remember once I was taking a lot of
15.000 big, strong wethers —touchy brutes
and pretty wild. I had ’em camped for the
night on a fence, with a deep creek right
alongside—a bad place, but the best
about. The mob settled down nicely.
I was going on watch every night just about
as the moon rose —revolving watches —as I
reckoned if the brutes were going to get off
camp that'd be about the time they’d move.
Well, this night I’d done my watch and
woke up the next man, an old fellow. I
told him they were all right, but to keep a
watch on them, and whatever he did to look
out for the steep banks of the creek, and not
get walking too close.
“I’d just got my boots off, and turning in,
when I heard a bit of a yell; then a
c-r-r-r-u-m-p, s-s-m-a-s-h. There was a big
‘W-o-o-f’ that shook the leaves on the trees
for half a mile round, and the old boy try-
ing his best to use manly language. He’d
fallen over the bank and landed on a dead
tree in the bottom.
“Me and those wethers hit the ground
together, and both of us started to gallop. I
just had time before I started to offer up a
bit of a prayer to whoever’d made that
ground and ask that there be no bindyies,
as I was barefooted. I raced along the gap
in the break to the corner where the sheep,
were headed for, and just as I passed one of
the fellows he was fumbling with a box of
matches. ‘Don’t strile a light, blast you.
don’t strike a light!’ I yelled at him. I
wheeled them at the corner of the break and
sent them ringing round the other way, and
just as I did it that fool struck a match and
held it above his head.
“You mightn’t know, but sheep’ll always
make for a light at night. Well, this par-
ticular idiot had hardly got the match
more’n about fairly up when one of the
wethers jumped straight at it. Biff ! Down
he went, hit fair in the chest. That sheep
went on, and the whole mob after him. Joe
underneath. Every time he opened his
mouth to sing out a sheep’d put a foot in
it. Every time he tried to get up he’d get
knocked down and rolled over. He came
from underneath that mob like as if he’d
been drunk and gone to sleep in the fowl-
house and the fowls had scratched him look-
ing for worms.
"I’d a couple of good dogs, and they saw
to the sheep. But they were a of a mob !
Next day when I went to count them they
carried away a strain of fence on each side
of the gate—you wouldn’t think sheep’d do
that, but I saw it. Sheep are all right,
though, and just as good money in ’em as
in -cattle.
“Now, .with cattle there’s this lot you
can be sure of. You’re going to be up
every morning before daylight; you’re
going to be with the cattle all day;
it’s going to be dark when you let your
horse go; and you’re going to have at least
a couple of' hours in the middle of the night
riding round the brutes, and maybe a bit
more, for luck, if they take it into their
heads to be snotty.
“Watching cattle’s no good to men in the
condition I was in then. Sheep give a man
a chance to think; cattle—cattle’re different.
I couldn’t help it. I couldn’t help thinking
of her when I was doing my watch. I used
to make up all sorts of talks between us—
all the ‘I said’ and ‘she said’ stuff —but I
had to drop it. One night I was carrying
on a real nice conversation with her, and
just when it came to my turn to make a
reply, I burst out, ‘You poking swine, if
you come out again I’ll cut your blasted
hide off!’ I reckoned it wasn’t fair to talk
like that, so I dropped it.”
“I suppose you have seen a stampede?”
I asked.
“No,” he replied. “Never. I’ve seen a
few rushes, though, and that’s ~ what you
mean to say, ain’t it? Rushes are —well,
they’re Hell. In fact, they’re Hell multi-
plied by the number of cattle you have.
Sometimes, most times, they start like a
snap of the finger. They’re here —they’re
gone. That’s the way most of ’em start.
Other times you’ll feel the mob working up
to it. You can feel it; your horse can feel
it, and the cattle feel it. It’s not a sen-
sation you want to go looking for. You
feel your horse’s heart beating against your
leg, and you feel your own heart knocking
against the crown of your hat. Frightened?
Yes. I never saw' a man yet that didn’t
admit he was a bit nervous, and I know
plenty that admit they’re dead wet.
“They’re gone! You and your horses are
with them. You race over places that you
wouldn’t look at in daytime. You’re dead
frightened just before you start, but once
you’re off you jamb your hat on and go like
the Devil. There may be fellows who’re
frightened to ride then, but I’ve never seen
’em. If there’s a human cow on this earth
wants shooting it’s the fellow who dodges
the watch by putting the hands of the clock
forward, so’s to make his watch shorter.
I’ve never seen the man, boy or black fel-
low who’d stick up for a man like that.
They’re scarce, though—very few men are
built that way. Anyhow', very few who
take to droving.
“Well, as I was saying, I was making
good money and all seemed as sweet as a
nut. I’d written to the girl telling her
I’d be with her for Christmas, and it was
drawing on towards it. I arranged to leave
my plant on good grass and took a couple
of horses with me, intending to poke alone'
steady to w'here she w'as. I’d been travel-
ling for some time and had still a
couple of hundred miles to go, w'hen it
started to rain like blazes. I was held up
for a bit and the time I’d allowed myself
was getting short, so I had to push along.
“One of the horses I had knocked up, and
—well, I only intended to take a loan of
the brute, anyway. But it w'as no use.
They wouldn’t believe my yarn, and had
me for illegally using. No one about there
knew me, and I hated the idea of my name
being in the papers, so that was the time
I took the moniker of Bill Smith. I went
up for 12 months, and if ever a man suf-
fered Hell it w'as me then. I thought a
couple of times of writing her; but, no.
I’d suffered in silence before, and I could
again. But, Lord, man, it w'as awful! I
made all sorts of plans for the future —I
knew she’d understand if only I’d a chance
of explaining to her—but I wouldn’t write.
“My time w'as up at last, and as soon
as I was out I made tracks to where I
knew I’d be able to get word of her. I
got word all right—she’d gone to another
tow'n, and there, on the second of September,
she’d married the postmaster of the place.
I didn’t blame her; I couldn’t. What is. it
that fellow said? ‘Hell hath no fury like
a woman scorned,’ ain’t it? Poor little girl,
she’d every right to think she’d been done
that to. I’ve never tried to communicate
with her since, and for all she knows I
might be dead: still I know' where, and
how', she is. I suppose she’s hapnv.
hope she is, anyway. But I think that I‘d
have made her happier.
“There’ve been girls since that I’ve
thought something of. and a few before, but
none half like her, and I’m glad that there
hasn’t been. Here, wait till I take my
hat off while I say it. If ever I can be tb"
least help to her she’s only to say the word,
and I’ll do all I can, so long as I can
stand up. to make life easier for her.”
“You haven’t forgotten her then?” I said.
“Forgotten her! Maybe seven years after
I’m dead I’ll just be beginning to forget.
Then years and years and years after that
maybe a couple of wandering spirits’ll be
having an argument and call on me to
settle it.
“ ‘Hey. Bill.’ one of them’ll call. ‘^}, 7 hat
year was it the world came to an end?’
“‘I forget w'hat year it was.’ I’ll tell
’em. ‘ln fact, without thinking for a while
I wouldn’t bet to a century or tw'o : but I
remember it w r as on the second of Sep-
tember.’ ”

Dead.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WOMAN, wondrously alone,
Smiling on your scented bier.
That which was my flesh and bone
Cold and dumb.... my dear.... my dear !
Closed the eyes that glowed in mine
Passion of a flame demure.
Purple-pale the shut lids shine
On your milk-white cheek and pure.
Chill your limbs. . . .cold. . . .cold as snow !
Can my love warm nought again?
Nor my hot dark tears that flow
Stir the blood to quickened pain?
You are dead, my sw T eet, my sweet,
Breasts and hands and lids of glee !
Life runs laughing through the street;
God is crying here with me.

ZORA CROSS.
Salvage.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the collier Five Stars, of New-
castle, left Auckland for her home
port after three months’ cruising on
the Maori coast, it was a happy crew which
hauled in the moorings and watched with
satisfaction her nose point towards Aus-
tralia. Built for a “6U-miler,” the vessel
had been out of her element in distant
waters, a fact which was borne out by two
collisions and a grounding within a week
of her arrival in the Dominion after immu-
nity from accident for 27 years in her cus-
tomary trade.
Like the ship, the crew was not in sym-
pathy with the strange surroundings. Mr.
Bluster, the mate, complained that the pubs
weren’t half as cheerful as the Black Dia-
mond. Mr. Grizzle, steward, cook, confi-
dant and handyman in general to the skip-
per, said that the beer hadn’t the snap of
the home pints. Captain Muggs, after the
succession of mishaps, had not a good word
to say of the Dominion; nor could Mr.
Swigger, the engineer, who had grown up
on Newcastle coal, see merit in any other.
As the shores of the Dominion faded from
sight in the wake of the collier the engineer
appeared to be the only one on board with
a grievance. The woes of his shipmates were
forgotten for the time. The weather was
fine and the wind in their favor. Unfor-
tunately Mr. Swigger had developed in its
most virulent form that malady peculiar to
all chief engineers—bunker fever. He had
asked for five days’ extra supply of what
he was pleased to call “Maori muck,” and
had been reduced to the customary allowance
of less than half. Though the quantity sup-
plied was more than ample to cover the voy-
age except under the most adverse condi-
tions, he entered on the voyage with a grouch
against shipowners, coaling companies and
furnaces that eat cpal in a gluttonous man-
ner. He complained to the fireman in the
stokehold for giving her too much fuel, and
made further complaint when the steam ran
down on account of his interference.
As the collier, flying light, mowed down
the miles between Auckland and Newcastle
in a sea as smooth as a millpond, Mr. Swig-
ger occupied his leisure hours in measuring
NECK OR NOTHING.
"Cut too low! Don’t be absurd! Why, it’s
almost choking me!”
and remeasuring the coal in the bunkers.
For diversion he came up on deck, gazed
intently at the cloudless sky, and growled:
“If the weather holds we’re right enough
and a hit to spare. But if it comes on
dirty”—the consequences were too serious to
be put into words.
Whether Mr. Swigger’s gloom had raised
the ire of the sea-gods or whether he was
possessed of unusual prophetic instinct is
not known, but before the voyage was half-
over ominous clouds banked up to the west-
ward, and a slight, imperceptible swell, set
in from the same direction.
“Been a bit of a ruffle round here,” said
the skipper.
“Going to be,” answered the engineer.
Mr. Swigger was right. For some time
it seemed to hang off. even showing signs
of passing over till the fifth day out, wuen
the wind increased to a gale and the swell
to a high head sea which the little collier
could hardly plough through.
After being hove-to for some time, with
no sign of tne storm abating, the mariners
determined to make a bid for port. One
moment on the crest of a mountainous wave
and the next in a valley between two for-
bidding cliff's of water, the Five Stars pushed
manfully onward. At short intervals she
shuddered fore and aft as a huge greenback
poured aboard and made her stagger like
a drunken man. One sea more savage than
the rest swamped the cabins and carried
a ventilator and some deck fittings over-
board. Mr. Grizzle and the morning meal,
prepared under difficulties in a galley now
horizontal, now vertical and occasionally
zig-zag, was enveloped by another comber
which nearly cost him the number of his
mess. It made short work of breakfast and
all other meals for that day as it skipped
merrily and devilishly into his domain and
left him, pots, pans, culinary utensils and
edibles in a sorry mixture on the slippery
tiled floor.
Next day the collier again hove-to. The
gale increased to a violent hurricane. The
vessel was novr between two fires, and had
not sufficient coal to push through it nor to
make port by turning back. Under the cir-
cumstances there was only one thing left to
do —keep in the track of shipping and get
towed in by another steamer.
The bunkers were sadly diminished, and
with all her wooden fittings such as bunks
and tables thrown in, there was not enough
fuel to get anywhere.
Mr. Swigger, black and melancholy, clam-
bered up from the bunkers.
“Twelve ton left,” he reported glumly.
“Counting the traditional bit engineers
keep up their sleeves?” the skipper asked.
“Counting the dust on my togs,” was the
reply.
“Misfortunes never come singly,” wailed
the skipper, who had long since developed
the engineer’s malady. “I was expecting to
make good that extra expense incurred over
yonder, and now the sea-gods have set us
again. Though we’ve been over 30 years
in the service, Swigger, I m afraid it’s the
sack for us this time. ’
“Yes,” the engineer growled, “a salvage
job won’t improve our standing,”
The long nose and diminutive form of Mr.
Grizzle interrupted the pessimists.
“’Oo says we've got to tow in as salvige?
I fer one one don’t reckon as it’s necessary.
The officers eyed the steward curiously.
“How do you make that out?” one of them
asked.
“If you let me, I’ll show you,” the little
man responded with an air of importance.
“And what’s more, I’ll get this hooker to
port without any salvige bill to pay.”
The skipper pricked up his ears at once. He
was in a hole and was open to any scheme
which could save his reputation and, in-
cidentally, liis 'billet. Mr. Bluster and Mr.
Swigger were also sympathetic, as the
steward had helped them out of more than
one difficulty in their long association.
Captain Muggs did not regard the scheme
in such a favorable light when the steward
intimated that he would only divulge it on
condition that he had the handling of matters,
and that his orders were obeyed without
question or argument. In short, Mr.
Grizzle demanded to be made skipper for the
time being.
The demand appeared extortionate, but
under the circumstances the skipper was not
in a position to stand on his dignity. Acting-
on the advice of the mate and engineer he
promised to abide by the
conditions set forth by
Mr. Grizzle, with a re-
minder that if the scheme
was a failure that gentle-
man could do his steward-
ing elsewhere in future.
By this time the wea-
ther had broken. Blue
patches were again vis-
ible in the sky, and the
swell went down as- sud-
denly as it had risen. The
steward, after being in-
formed that there was
only sufficient coal on
boa r d for twenty-four
hours’ steaming, issued
his first order.
“Stop ’er and keep ’er
stopped till furt h e r
notice!”
The commands which
followed perplexed the
skipper and astounded
the crew. Captain Muggs
felt loath to pass them on
in spite of the assurance
he had given the steward,
and only did so as a last
resource in an extremity.
Mutiny was threatened
in more than one quarter,
but an occasional tot of
grog judiciously served
out of the skipper’s case
by the new commander
solaced the unruly spirits.
When the weather
cleared u p the coal-
derricks were lowered on deck and all hands
were ordered over the side to paint ship—
not the regulation black, but a light slate
color. The derricks were then placed in a
position and camouflaged to give the vessel
the appearance of a three-poster. Captain
Muggs, Mr. Bluster and the engineer joined
the crew and daubed away with the brushes
on, the stages overside and pretended not to
overhear remarks as to certain persons in
high authority being insane. When the
funnel had been converted from black to
something between yellow and pink, and the
name plates unscrewed from bow and stern,
the method of the steward’s madness made
itself clear to all hands.
“It’s as simple as ABC,” said an elated
skipper. “Why any man ever got let in for
a salvage claim I don’t know.”
By dinner-time next day even the pioneers
of the ship who had served in her since her
entry into Australian waters were unable
to recognise their home of nearly thirty
years. Sim now figured on the high seas as
the Silas K. Snorter, of Boston, Mass., and
names testifying to her changed condition
were exhibited on bow and stern. Further
proof of her new identity was furnished later
when a Yankee stars and stripes was maim-
factured from old flags and what spare
bunting and rags were available, and hown
from a stern pole.
THE TEST.
MRS. POTMUTTER: “We will have to take a present to the Abrahams’ golden wedding,
and it’ll have to be gold, of course.”
MR. POTMUTTER: "Rather—old Issg will be waiting at the door all right with his little
pot of acid!”
Captain Muggs and lii.s companions began
to compliment the little mail.
“Congratulate me when the job’s over,”
he said. "It’s not half through yet, and we
must get a move on before we're spotted by
our rescuin’ steamer. The stage is prepared,
but the players ain’t rigged for the drama
yet. Ain’t a bit o’ use disguisin’ a ship and
not her crew—especially the good-lookin’
fellers. They might blow the gaff by bein’
recernised afterwards.”
“And how do you propose to do that, Mr.
GrizzleV” the skipper inquired in a perturbed
tone.
“jest step along to me cabin in single
file accordin’ to rank, navy fashion, and 1 11
soon have yer fixed so as your wife’s sister
couldn’t twig yer with a hig pay-day.”
Reluctantly Captain Muggs led the proces-
sion to the steward’s domain.
“I’d rather wait till some o’ the
others” __
His protestations were useless. With a
suave remark about good-lookin’ skippers
bein’ a menace to salvige-dodgers, he invited
Captain Muggs to be seated. “See these
’ere,” he added, pointing to some mixtures
resembling coal-tar.
“Yes—yes!” answered the skipper with a
shudder, “but I hope”——
“Hope for the best, skipper, xer want
ter save salvige, an’ I promised ter do it
for yer. If me orders are obeyed 111, do
what 1 promised. If not, I can t. Ih l s . ere
crew’s goin’ ter be a real true-bill American
lot o sailormen, an’ ter show the lower
ratin’s a good example. I’m making the
executive the niggers and eonyertm the
humbler seamen into white-washed xanks .
"But this is damned nonsense, Mr. Grizzle
—damned nonsense.”
"Have it yer own way, skipper. Obej or
disobey, an’ I act accord in .
After further deliberation and vain argu-
ments that Mr. Bluster and Mr. Swigger
should represent blacks and Captain Muggs
a white-washed Yank, the skipper permitted
the transformation scene to begin.
Next, please. said the stew aid in a
business-like manner as the negro master-
manner emerged from his sanctum. Objec-
tions raised by the mate and engmeei weie
overcome after gentle persuasion, and t ey
were duly converted to colored gentlemen.
The transformation had not taken place
any too soon, for smoke was detected on the
horizon before the converts had ceased
deriding each other on then newly-acqui e
personal charms. The crew raised a .cheer
was seen that the distress signals
of the Silas Iv. Snorter had been observed
and that the vessel was heac mg < wn to
render them assistance.
Mr. Grizzle, who was watching the vessel
keenly through a pair of binoculars pur-
chased from a broken punter after the last
Melbourne Cup. uttered an involuntary cry
of joy as she drew nearer.
“Biowed if it ain’t the dirty Dago that put
me eve out fer Minnie in the Black Diamond
on his last voyage! Him with his long mous-
tache an’ bowin’ an’ scrapin’ in motor-cars
at the company’s expense fer the ladies. Oh,
oh, Antonio!”
As the Italian steamer bore down upon
them all hands soon recognised the Garibaldi
and showed anxiety lest their own identity
should be discovered.
Captain Antonio and those under him
however, were too pre-occupied in estimatinc
the amount of their salvage claims and in
making preparation, after the usual excitable
nature of the Latin races, to give a thought
to the identity of the vessel, let alone the
crew. Dancing up and down the bridge,
Captain Antonio whistled a chorus from an
Italian opera, and contemplated the beauti-
ful presents lie would purchase for Mmnie
when he reached port with his prize,
“Yanka pac-keto Silas K. Snorter,” re-
ported the mate from the forecastle-head —
“from Bostona.”
The boat was then launched in readiness,
"You wanta tow to porta V” bawled the
joyful skipper as soon as the distressed
steamer tvas within hailing distance.
‘‘Guess so, Cap. Send your line across!’’
In less than half an hour the Silas K.
Snorter was homeward bound in tow. Her
destination, like the Italian’s, was Sydney,
“Orl very nice and pleasant,” exclaimed
Mr. Grizzle as he gazed ahead from a perch
on the forecastle-head and watched the collier
making good progress in the calm after the
storm.
Then the crew was set to work. Black
paint was mixed. The derricks and other
dismantled gear parts were placed in
position to be easily shipped when it became
necessary. The stern and other portions of
the ship not likely to be seen from the
Garibaldi were painted their original hue.
All hands except the helmsman slept by day
and toiled hard at night,
Favored by good weather the vessels
arrived off the coast without delay or inci-
f]ent. Captain Antonio signalled to the col-

If I Were a Duke!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
| F I were a duke or a marquis, dear,

And a couple of million pounds a year.

With fav’rites around in swarms,
With luscious lips and languishing eyes
And the loveliest yielding forms,
They wouldn’t see much of their lord, you

All kisses but yours I’d bar,
If I were the Sultan himself, my pet,
And you were the girl you are.
If I were a knight of the skies above,
With a trim little aeroplane,
I’d take you aloft to a world of love,
And we’d never come back again.
We’d go sailing away in our trim V.-V.,
Till we hitched the machine to a star,
If I were a kind of a K.8.E..
And you were the girl 3-011 are.
W ere 1 the lord of an empire grand,
W itli sceptres and thrones and things,
And wide dominion o’er sea and land,
And a hundred subject kings,
Above the wealth of the royal purse
One treasure I’d value far.

And you were the girl you are.
W ere I just a prince, or a noble earl.
With a castle, or two, or three,
W hen the dukes and duchesses saw my girl,
They’d know what a girl should be.
’Twould cause some stir in the social whirl.
And some tabbies we know’t would vex,
When a plush-clad flunkey announced “The

The Test.
[FOR BULLETIN.]
COMPTON stared at the woman, doubt-
ing that he saw aright. It seemed
to him, for a moment or two, either
that his brain had gone wrong, misled, per-
haps, by the mirage lights that had' gleamed
and glittered before him during the whole of
his long day’s ride from the homestead on
the Ranges, or that, somehow, he w'as back
again w'here he had been five years before.
It was unaccountable that at such a time
and in such a place this thing should hap-
pen, and that the menace he dreaded more
than anything else in the world should thus
confront him. He stood with his hand on
his horse’s saddle, a foot still in the stirrup,
perplexed, uncertain, his breath coming hard.
Meanwhile the woman, watchful of his dis-
comfiture, leaned against the doorpost of the
out-station, smiling.
ou here!” lie said at length. “What
does it mean?”
The woman smoothed her hair, smiling still.
“Nothing to make mountains of. John,”
she replied. “If you remember, you hired
me and my husband to come here and work
for you a week ago. My husband surely
explained all this to you.”
HE PAID THE BILL.
THE GIRL: “My dressmaker says that a soft,
simple little thing suits me best.”
THE HUSBAND: “She was referring to me,
I suppose.”
Compton’, still shocked by the surprise of
the moment, said nothing, and the woman,
leaning towards him, continued:
“It’s a queer welcome you give me. John.
One would think from your manner that we
had never met before. What a difference a
wife can make!”
Her lips still smiled, but in her eyes was
a hard light. Compton remembered to have
seen its like in the eyes of a liawk.
“'This wifjp” she went on—“tell me about
her. A good woman, is she not —just the
sort of woman you deserved?” Then with
a short laugh—“ And thinking you, no doubt,
a good man !”
Compton flushed, the triumph in her
manner and the sting in her words hurting
him.
“I can’t say I’m glad to see you,” he said
angrily. “When we parted, five years ago, I
hoped it would be forever.”
The woman, again brushing her hair back
from her forehead in the old manner he re-
membered so well, answered him quietly.
“But I’m glad to see you, John —gladder
than your saintly wife will be when I have
told her our story.”
Compton took a step forward, his hands
clenching, his eyes darkeneing.
“That must not be,” he said sternly.
“Whatever you do to me—l am not the
man 1 Was. lam the man she has made me,
and you must not spoil her handiwork.”
The woman tilted her chin, looking down
on him with half-closed eyes disdainfully.
“You say I must not. ‘Must’ is not the
word to use, John. But hang your horse
up and come in; my husband has gone to
town, and there is no one in the house. I
have longed to talk with you, as we used to
talk in the old days.”
Compton, assenting, entered the room and
threw himself down in a chair. The day’s
ride had been hot, the track hard, and he
was tired. The woman seated herself oppo-
site him, her face in shadow. Shadow suited
its pallor, its clear, soft lines and the large,
dark eyes that looked out from it. It was
midsummer, and the heat had brought its
legion of flies. These made a subdued mur-
mur in the room, and for some seconds, as
the woman and the man faced each other,
there was no other sound.
Then she spoke with startling suddenness.
“You would like me to be dead.”
Compton winced, but, recovering himself,
lifted his arms, contracting his muscles as
though to get the weariness out of them, and
yawned slightly with an appearance of in-
difference. “I don’t know that I would like
that altogether,” he answered. “As things
are, you are sufficiently dead, being dead to
me. I buried you five years ago.”
In the shadow the woman’s face grew paler
still. Her eyes lit up as though fires, hidden
at other times, burned within them, and for a
moment the smile* vanished from her small red
mouth. Compton, as he looked at her, felt
something shrinking within him, and for the
first time in a hard, rough life, knew what
fear was. He turned his eyes from her sud-
denly, with a wrench, and looked out through
the open doorway on the hot, level plain,
with its clumps of saltbush and its ragged
river-gums swimming in the trembling heat-
haze.
“You are making a mistake,” he heard the
woman say, “I am not dead; you did not
bury me. Where you and yours are con-
cerned I intend to be very much alive indeed.
I have waited five years for this moment, and
if your wife is the woman she is said to be
1 have not waited in vain.”
Either the heat and the long ride or the
emotional stress made Compton sag in his
seat, as though his spine had suddenly
weakened.
“Why,” he asked —-“why should you want
to ruin me?”
The woman leaned towards him, her tone
as she spoke tense with feeling, her hands
closing and unclosing, as though she held
something within them which she sought
to grip more securely.
“Because you were once, and should be
still, my man. Because you made me love
you. Because you spoiled God’s big, bright
world for me, and because, when you tired
of me and met a saint, you cast me off. Do
you want other reasons, or are these enough?”
Compton, not lifting his eyes to meet hers,
replied: “You make too much of it; after
all it was only an adventure.”
The woman laughed ; and even in the heat,
raying down from the iron roof above, her
laughter chilled him.
“An adventure perhaps,” she said. “But
some adventures go a long way, and this of
ours is not ended yet, John.”
Compton brushed
a fly from his face
with a quick, ner-
vous hand. “Well,
w'hat do you intend
to do?” he asked.
“I’ve told you
a 1 r e a d y,” the
woman replied.
“I’m going to smash
a tall, brown god
with feet of clay.
I have all the let-
ters you sent me—
look. I have them
in my bosom here
for safe keeping.
When the honey
was in the flower,
and we were all in
all to each other.
They’ll make in-
teresting reading
for your wif e.
Then, too, I’ll show
her your curt note
to me, when I was
in the hospital and
you thought I was
going to die and
worry you no more.”
“That’s not true,” said Compton sharply.
“I did not think you were going to die. ’
“But you wished it?”
“No.”
The woman, leaning forward from her
chair, put her face close to his.
“But you wish it now!” she said.
There was something in her eyes, their set
searching stare, which challenged the truth
within him. He did not speak, he could not
lie. but he answered her with a look.
“Just so,” she nodded. “I knew' it.”
Compton, turning from her again, looked
through the open doorway on the scene with-
out. His heart was not within him, and
he felt that the woman had truly gauged
him. He deemed himself helpless before
her-—putty in her long, white hands, to be
torn and shaped as she willed. Far away,
on a stock route, he saw a dust cloud mov-
ing slowly westward—the dust of travelling
sheep. Beyond them lay the bare, ragged
slopes of the Barrier Ranges, with here and
there a white quartz blow sparkling, like
heaped ice in the sunlight. These things
lie scarcely noticed, these things and' a hawk
that wheeled in the cloudless blue of the
sky. A movement of the woman brought
his eyes back to her.
HELPING HIM OUT.
“There was something I wanted to say to you, hut it's gone clean out of my head."
"It wasn’t ’good-night,’ was it?”
She had risen, and was standing, with
one hand resting lightly on the table between
them.
“I am sorry,” she said to him, smiling,
“that I cannot die to please -you.”
Compton rose and turned to go.
“Stay,” she said, “and I will make you a
cup of tea. It will hearten you for what is
to come.”
“I -want none.”
“Still, stay,” she insisted, “and keep me
company, while I. at least, have one”
A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING.
GOVT. MINE INSPECTOR: “It’s no good,
Treloar, I shall report yon to the
Minister .”
REBELLIOUS COUSIN JACK: “ Minister!
Who’s a got do wi’ ’e? This edden a
church affair.”
He resumed his seat, not because of in-
clination, out under a subtle compulsion. It
seemed to him that the woman had strange
power over him still. His mind went back
to the days when her beauty first attracted
him, as a magnet sucks in steel. He won-
dered now was it only her beauty that had
done so, or a power behind her beauty. He
did not guess then that behind her charms —
her strong, sweet profile, her brown, coiled
hair, her large, dark eyes* —lay so much will,
such character. What an enemy she had
become —how strong, how implacable !
He knew his wife, though—knew her
through and through—and feared that when
his hidden past was made plain to her, as
this woman would surely make it plain, her
love for him would go to pieces, shattered
as with a maul. It might be, indeed, that
being of a type that expects and exacts much,
and forgives little, she would leave him for-
ever. Since he loved her this must not
be. But how could he prevent it? Lying
back in his chair he cursed the woman whose
hate meant so much, wishing, in truth, that
she were dead.
She came into the room presently, carrying
the tea things with her, and placing them
on the table. As she set them down her
hand trembled, so that some of the contents
of the sugar-basin fell on the cloth in front
of Compton.
I am all nerves.” she said, “since that
sickness I had, when you left me. I went
very close to death then—very, very close I
came out of it in a cruel condition, and with
a long, long leeway to make up. I had lust
my hearing, my voice, much of my sense
ot taste. In time voice and hearing came
back to me—-but my old sense of taste never
Sickness and you have spoiled mv relish fo
many things.”
She poured the tea into the cup. her hand
no longer trembling, but steady now. her
dark eyes bid from bis but still watching
him, as she sat with down-turned face.
Compton, bis chin upon bis hand, his elbow
on the back of bis chair, remained silent.
His head ached with the fierce, dry heat that
filled the room, and with the fiercer despair
that laid crippling hands upon him. and
numbed his brain. Then, as a man some-
times will, when he endeavors to escape from
the stress of too much thought, he began to
take notice of little things—the Hies on the
table, amongst others.
They were grouped about the little heap
of sugar that had fallen from the basin;
they made a ring around it, but they did
not touch it. Now and again one would
alight on it, but without tasting it go off
hurriedly. What was the matter with them?
Knowing that there is no sweeter diet than
sugar for a fly, the behavior of the insects
struck Compton as unaccountable. And then
something else struck him as strange also.
The sugar, if sugar it was, was finer than
that usually issued on his station —fine as
Hour almost. lie suspected that it was not
sugar at all.
The woman’s eyes were on her cup, she
was stirring its contents and, watching her.
Compton’s hand stole out. He dipped a
finger in the little heap of white stuff on
the table, and put it to his lips. He knew
the taste; he suspected no longer; suspicion
had become certainty. At that moment the
woman put more of the stuff into her cup,
and looking up as she stirred the tea said
to him: “When can I see your wife, Comp-
ton ?”
Compton's frame trembled so that the table
against which he leaned shook and creaked.
A sort of fierce joy surged through him. He
did not answer her question nor look in her
eyes, because he feared that something in
his voice or in his look might betray the
dark knowledge that made him thrill. But
he watched her hand as she stirred the tea.
She had told him that she had lost her sense
of taste. How finely things had shaped
themselves! When she had finished the con-
tents of the cup she would trouble him no
more. She would be past troubling anyone.
When the cup was empty he would leave
her. The letters he would get somehow.
There was no house within 20 miles from
which help would be likely to come, and her
husband would not be back from town till
to-morrow night or When he
did return he would find her as she deserved
to be, and the contents of the sugar-basin
would explain all. His hands went up to bis
forehead spasmodically, and his fingers
through his hair.
“You have not answered my question,
said the woman; “but you may _be sure 1
shall do what I have threatened.”
As she spoke she fixed her eyes on his. a
something in them —what it was he did not
know —making him shrink as when a raw

It is evident that the ideal
for the country is one that p
I.G.E,
electric lighting set
rovides all the com-
forts and conveniences of a city electric supply,
or, in other words, a complete electric service.
That is what you get with the
Home Light and
Power Unit.
Just think of it! Electric Light —as bright as
you need it —in every room in the house, in the
out-buildings and wherever else you may want
it, just by turning a switch.
That alone is a great convenience, but the utility
of this outfit does not end there. It also provides
ample electric power to permit the uses of many
domestic devices, here illustrated, to lessen the
burden of housework.
Further, the full horse-power of the engine is
available at all times for driving light machinery.
The I.G.E. HOME LIGHT and POWER
UNIT can be installed in any convenient posi-
tion, and is compact, economical to run, safe, and
easily operated. It will pay for itself in comfort
and convenience alone.
Write to-day for full particulars. We 'will gladly
furnish whatever information you require.

Electric Fan
Electric Cleaner
With electricity at your service real comfort in
the home can be easily obtained, a touch of a
switch being practically the only operation neces-
sary to permit the use of any electrical device.
The possessor of a G. E. Electric Fan has no diffi-
culty in keeping cool during the summer months.
Meals can be quickly and easily prepared for a
small family with such devices as an electric grill,
a toaster, and a kettle, or a coffee percolator.
The often laborious task of house-cleaning be-
comes a pleasure when an electric vacuum cleaner
is used, and ironing day, with an Edison Electric
Iron, is looked forward to rather than dreaded.
Last but by no means least is that greatest of
all modern comforts, electric light —the safest,
cleanest and most economical of all illuminants.

This is the I. G. E.
HOME LIGHT
and Power Unit.
It consists of three princi-
pal parts An Engine,
A Generator, and a
Storage Battery.
The operation of this outfit is simplicity itself.
The engine uses kerosene fuel and is
started by moving a lever mounted on
a simple switchboard, which controls the
whole outfit.
The generator, which is connected direct
to the engine and driven by it, charges
the storage battery, from which the cur-
rent for lighting or power is taken. When
the battery is fully charged, the engine
stops automatically.
The throwing of a switch disconnects the whole
electrical system from the engine, which can tlfen
be used as an ordinary oil engine.

To a Hypersensitive Soul Clouded.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS when a cloud*in mercy shields the eye
From the noon-sun, whose beam may
burn and sear,
So, with the evil of the world drawn nigh.
Thou art in hiding here.
Thy tender heart could not the battle know
To be but war for others, and not bleed ;
And the world’s ills fell on thee like a blow,
And made thee dazed indeed.
Around thine innocence the foul lies crept,
The lies of life being but an evil stain ;
The guilty cry “Despair!” heard while thou
slept,
Or turned to sleep again.
And we were separate as distant stars;
I from thee taken by work, contest, fame.
The man’s ambition, the pursuit that mars,
These be my present shame.
Thy childhood budding as some lonely isle,
Losing thyself in speculating dreams;
And manhood passing with a careless smile
Thy truth for that that seems
To be the truth, and yet is most a lie;
For only in the child is there the truth ;
And the clear vision and the clean hope die,
And pass with youth.
All aspirations and all raptures thwarted,
So that confused became both ill and good;
A spirit chilled that hungered to be courted,
And loved and understood.
And, in false fear of the fair world made vile,
Thou hast thyself turned back from
womanhood;
Alike from knowledge clean and unclean guile
To childhood’s neutral good.
And now a curtain ’twixt thy mind and mine
Ilangs between thee and me. and soul and
sense;
Y"et still within thy secret self doth shine
The clear intelligence.
So let us children be again, both you and I.
To be again two careless happy things;
To feel the child’s pained heart-throb when
the sky
Some transient shadow flings;
To know the children’s heartleap when the
pines
Pass from night's blackness to the green
of dawn;
To see the agapanthus’ serried lines
Upon the weedy lawn ;
To watch the climbing rose fling musky snow
Of its blown petals to the tender air ;
To see the scarlet-flowering gum-trees grow.
The earlv jonquil dare
The chilling winds that rage in early June;
To know September by the Florentine
Lilies, and purple orchids on the dune,
And blackbirds in the pine;
And see October bring wistaria in
In all her lavender; and see her bloom.
And her racemes and trosses, like close kin,
Invading Florin’s room ;
And stand beneath the fruit-trees in their
blossoih.
.Vs when you were a child —but rarely
since—
And ivory beauty on your head and bosom
Fall from the flowering quince.
We shall again be children by the sea,
With the ten-feet horizons of a child ;
And from the world and all its noises free,
As children undefiled.
Song of the thrush shall be our epic high.
Our sceptre-sword the pampas-grass’s
plume;
And nothing in our world grow old or die,
Or find decay or doom.
And to all things—the bird, the air, the tree.
Inanimate or mobile —you shall sing.
As in your childhood you have sung to me,
Sweet-serious as the Spring:
CONNUBIAL CONFIDENCE.
"Geovge, I don't believe you did put the cat
out.”
"Well, if you think I'd tell a lie about a
little thing like that, go and put her out
yourself.”
And, wondering and tender, ask of me
The mysteries childhood’s hope must try
to force; *
Mystery of life and love, of spring aud sea,
And of life’s hidden source.
And you shall write
for me the poesy
Of moonlight, sun-
light. and the
dappled leaf;
And spin romance
to the magnolia
tree,
And the wild
grass’s sheaf.
THE STUDY OF OSCULATION.
SHE : "You kiss like an expert .”
HE: “You criticise like a connoisseur.”
And we shall go handfasted through the
trees.
Happy alike by mountain and the plain;
But thou and I—and all the joy it yields
To be a child again.
And when that curtain is dissolved in air
That now is gauze between the sight and
sense,
We shall grow up, and see the world new-
fair
In new intelligence.
QUEENSLAND.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
A Dweller in Vacancy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE had not been in the Telegraph
Branch with us a week before we
called him The Phantom. The name
was inspired chiefly by two things, his operat-
ing and his eyes. Both were weird. In
addition, he spoke to none of us —cama-
raderie, let it be known, is our big joss—ex-
cept for the monosyllables necessary to duty.
His nickname, therefore, was very apt.
We discussed him amongst ourselves tire-
lessly, but no one had a sound explanation
to give of the newcomer. All that was
known of him was that he was a temporary
man called E. E. Elkworth. and that he came
from Maoriland. However, we presently
ceased to say “Who is he?” We asked
instead “What is he?” “Gad,” said some-
one, putting it all into a few words, “he’s a
Chinaman for mystery! Has he a tongue,
does anybody know? He gives one the
creeps with his queer, unseeing stare, his
silence and his confounded operating!”
Now, a telegraphist has no distinguishing
marks. In the main, he is the most unpro-
fessional-looking type there is. The exceed-
ing skill of his ears and of his fingers is un-
shown in his movements, even when that skill
is in execution. Though he be operating
most brilliantly, he lounges in his chair like
a commercial traveller in a smoker. And
the style of his dress matches his gait- This
was where the
new man was
especially dif-
ferent. When
he was seated
at his line, iiis
spinal column,
feet and elbows
were as be-
haved as a
nun’s, and his
suits and mer-
cery were
exquisite and
carefully worn.
But we did not
comment upon
that; it was his
eyes which
caused the
wonder. At all
times they
were the un-
winking, fa r-
gazing ones of a
sleepwalker.
Then his
operating.
When we
quietly stood
over The Phan-
tom's shoulder
to verify what
the com m o n
tongue was ex-
citedly report-
in g of hi m.
gravitation got
at our chins
and open fell
our mouths. He
was not “receiv-
ing” ; he was
juggling, taking
the stuff trick-fashion. He had his relay de-
liberately “screwed back,” so that the per-
fection of the signals was destroyed. Not
another man of us could “pick” one-tenth of
the skeleton letters that faltered through.
y ( >t The Phantom was getting them all right
and without any pauses for smart guessing.
He was. besides, that rarity, a message-behind
ITl an That alone would have kept him high in
our estimation; but when wo watched him
remaining behind in cipher telegrams, -we
perceived the real state of affairs: he was
not a mere genius, he was a freak at the
game. He was not showing off, either. A
glance at his face knocked that suspicion out.
He was working mechanically, unaware of
all but the task in
hand, and this dis-
courtesy to his ear of
wilfully giving it dif-
ficulty was his pre-
ferred way of "re-
ceiving.”
Bill Brassmore accosted me one day. There
is a little cross above him in Flanders now,
poor chap, but at this time he was a writer
of short stories of no mean skill and success.
All happenings around him were grist to his
mill, and I was his enemy only inasmuch as
1 was brutally critical when I explored his
MSS., which he always brought along to
me, for he declared that I had the gift of
meaty small words over his heavily-lettered
ones. Moreover, he and I were working at
a little invention of which we had great
hopes.
“This Flkworth bird, Bob,” he said —"he’ll
end in a decent story for me, please mother.
I’m carrying salt to put on his tail. Hop
on to him for me if you can any time —the
chance may come in spite of the prospects.
Twigged his eyes? Carefully, that is. lie’s
hypnotised. That’s why he walks past tin-
lot of us and never sees us.”
“Hypnotised!”
He moved impatiently. “Not actually, of
course. By Elkworthism, whatever it is.
Hope I can gather it in. There’s fact there
that would make fiction look half-fed from
birth. Great tag they’ve put on him, eli?
‘The Phantom’ fits him like his suits do.
The man’s unique, beautiful !”■ —meaning as
a plot.
Weeks and months went by and The Phan-
tom di(J not dwindle in mystery. In lift and
street and on the job he passed us blind to
our existence. It was weird in its very
consistency. Feat after feat thickened his
fame in the room. He was engineer as well
as operator. His knowledge of the big inter-
state apparatus was arousing the respect of
the;chiefs. Two unseparated questions flew
continually, “Who is he? What is he?”
It was given unto Brassmore and me to
at last know.
There was a great craning of necks the
day The Phantom came to my line and
spoke to me.
“Mr. Storm?” he queried pleasantly.
Mine was the astonishment of Pygmalion
when his statue spoke. I could only nod
with my mouth open.
“Mr. Storm, I believe you are inventing
something?”
Remembering that I had a tongue just in
time to check another nod, I shed the ges-
ture. “A little idea,” I replied, “shared by
Bill Brassmore there.” (Bill, gaping two cir-
cuits away, hurriedly dropped bis eyes as
he saw himself pointed at.)
“Ah, well, don’t look on it as impertinent,
but a coincidence is involved. May 1 speak
with you and him when we knock off?”
The outcome of the conference was that,
the next evening, Brassmore and 1 were at
The Phantom’s diggings —a private place on
St. Kilda-road kept by a very select old
couple-—-telling him without reserve what
we expected to achieve.
“In a nutshell,” we concluded, “we aim
to scrap the present cumbrous Wheatstone
system with its gells, transmitters, receivers,
tape, ink, gum and all the things that entail
costly maintenance and a vast amount of
labor, and replace it with a small instru-
ment per line which a single man at each
end can manage.”
“‘Yes,” came thoughtfully from The Phan-
tom. “I like the sound of it —metallic ink
characters reproducible at any distance. ’
He was reflective awhile, then said;
“Gentlemen, I have somewhat the same idea
in connection with wireless. No. don’t be
alarmed, we won’t overlap. I am anxious
for rapid progress. Can we work together i
‘Many hands,’ you know. Joint construc-
tion "of parts will obtain quick models. I
am sure.”
We. Bill and I, did not hesitate. The
suggestion was »ne we might have urged
ourselves.
“Thank you. Now come along to my
workroom.”
It revealed what we expected, a welter of
tools, Morse- and wireless-gear, charts, bat-
teries, wires.
“Any wireless knowledge? No? _ Well,
that’s of no consequence. Manual assistance
is the exchangeable quantity, isn’t it?"
He obligingly explained each instrument
briefly, then handed me the "receiver. ’ “Get
acquainted with the ether,” he said. I
listened with a thrill, awed at using my ear
upon a vast mystery-laden void. Piny
dronings, thin squeaks—communication ! It
made me feel as I had felt only once before.
and that was in a dream. Dreams, I know,
belong to women’s wonder, not to men’s.
The average male is ashamed, scornful of
the nocturnal drama, except, perhaps, at
Cup time. But one had a lasting effect upon
me, try to restrain its memory as 1 will. A
cloaked and hooded man took me to a
cemetery and sank into the ground with me
to a network of eerily-lighted passage-ways.
“‘Listen to the unhappy dead!” he said, and
he slowly preceded me through arm after
arm of that monstrous maze. I heard in
the rigid stillness hollow knot-kings such as
might drift through the silence of a great
gaol at night when the prisoners tap on the
walls of their cells for company. They
floated hither and thither from points ail
around me. They froze my very soul, for
they came from coffins !
The whispers that sped in the ether were
so strangely akin in source to the signalling
in my dream that cold lingers seemed to flick
along my spine. For just an instant, of
course, commonsense never being petrified
long by foolish fancy. Besides, here was
the resemblance to old friends, the telephone
buzzers of country post-offices, I could
““pick” numerous words.
“Anyone working?” breathed a tense voice
in my other ear. “Cod, how I love those
vagrant voices! They come and flash on
and are lost. Oh, to capture them, to make
them burst into identity on paper! 1 must,
I shall! A lig for land lines! A fig, I say!"
Brassmore and I received this with amaze-
ment and consternation. A man who stares
at nothing and mutters wildly is not wholly
sane. The next moment, however, he was
apologising.
“Don’t think that lam crazy. I am over-
wrought. Sit down and light up again and
I will tell you why.
“'First of all, telegraphy goes hack in our
family a long, long way. My dad, as far
as gift is concerned, is every dead Elkwo'rth
still existing in that one living brain. Soon
after his marriage he left Maoriland for the
United States. He soared through the bril-
liant systems there, and what he did not
know about the game was not worth know-
ing. When 1 was 17 —the only child
mother and I returned to the Dominion for
a holiday. She died there* suddenly. That
brought dad back. Boor dad ! Consumption
got him. got him cruelly, snatching from him
the glory-to-be which he was on the thresh-
old cf establishing in the way of inven-
tions. Fearing that his brain might go. In-
shut himself up and drafted his ideas for
me to bring out; then he went into a
sanatorium to die— near mother. He will
not come north, for he calls himself already
dead. He is dying of disappointment and
grief as much as of the disease; but his
dreams and hopes of me, the last of his
line, buoy him up just enough to make death
slow. By the way, I could operate long be-
fore I left school. Dad had seen to that -
seen to it well!”
“Lord, yes!” said Brassmore and I
together.
“I was referring to his diligence. I am
only dad’s inevitable product, for 1 was
coached his way : memory perfected first so
as to be able to dawdle when ‘receiving,’
not dash in wild pursuit and overtake; to
take evenly, not in flashes; to know the
mutilations to signals due to bad weather.
NOT HIS CLASS.
“No man with any sense would allow his
wife to carry on the way you do!”
"Yes—but how does that affect you?”
to touch type. As for sending, that was
only care and proper wrist action. So
simple, you see.”
No doubt: but I chose to give credit whore
credit was due. So I said ; “You stand away
out by yourself. We have never before seen
anything like you.”
“That would gratify old dad to hear. But
to get to the crux of the matter. My own
lungs weakened; dad hurried me to the
Commonwealth here, Brisbane being my des-
tination after acclimatising a little. Accli-
matising V Why, I have been here months
and months. It’s this workshop. I cant
uproot and transplant it!
“Now, listen. Dad’s over yonder dream-
ing of his son’s altering the world’s teleg-
raphy—he firmly believes that land lines
will not. cannot vanish before wireless- -
and I’m doing what?” His voice sank to
a shamed whisper. “!’«/ ocean-deep in wire-
less ! So I am a renegade! Dad’s poor in-
ventions! He’d go mad!”
“Ah!” said Brassmore to me with his eyes.
I thought of someone else who might go
mad. No fellow stares all the while at
distant places and does not see his fellow -
creatures without a tragedy to the mind
being very close. The I‘hantom had my juo
found sympathy. Here was a conscientious
son tortured and self-accused at having gom
beyond the science of his father.
I waded in to buck him up, but he shook
his head. “I promised. It would blast ius
mind if be knew. Yet- greater forces than

THE FACTS BRIEFLY:—
A standard ESSEX Touring Car has broken
the transcontinental records both ways, as
well as that for the round trip from New
York to ’Frisco and back.
Every quality in a car is tested to the utmost in this terrific trial:—
Speed, Reliability, Mountain-Climbing' and
Desert-Sand Efficiency, Power, Flexibility and
Extreme Endurance.
7000 MILES AT RACING SPEED
Over roads ranging from the very best to the worst imaginable; over three mountain ranges, and
across deserts and prairies. For nearly 10 days the ESSEX averaged more than 30 miles per
hour against these almost overwhelming conditions.
DETAILS of the RUN.
The distance from New York to San Fran-
cisco is 3347 miles, which the Essex covered
in 4 days 19 hours 17 minutes.
From ’Frisco to New York the Essex im-
proved on this marvellous performance by
covering the ground in 4 days 14 hours 43
minutes.
The total distance for the round trip was
6694 miles, and the actual time taken was 9
days 10 hours. The average speed for 9S days
was over 30 miles per hour.
The previous record was made by a Hudson
Super-Six three years ago, the time for the
total distance being 10 days 21 hours. During
the interval many makes of cars have
attempted to lower this record, but either
failed to do so, or broke down hopelessly
under the terrific strain. Therefore the Essex
and the Super-Six, both Hudson products,
jointly hold the laurels.
RELIABILITY and
ENDURANCE
Were the keynotes of this performance, and these
are the qualities that Australia demands of motor-
cars before any other consideration.

DETAILS of the COUNTRY
The Record-breaking Essex (ravelled nearly
twelve times, the distance between Sydney and
Melbourne, which is the classic Australian
Record.
Three mountain ranges had to he crossed,
including the terrible Sierra Nevadas and
Rockies, where roads are but mountain trails
hewn roughly from the granite walls.
The great sandy desert, where the track
was hardly distinguishable, made fast travel-
ling an impossibility, and the car, though
strained anti wracked to the limit of its en-
durance. never faltered.
Furthermore, over 330 cities, towns and
villages were passed through, where speed
limits were observed.


myself compel what I am doing. I’m help-
less. .. .helpless. It’s... .anguish.” His
lips were white with wretchedness.
“Poor devil!” said Brassmore on our way
home.
“If onlv he were not wasting too.” I re-
joined, “then there would perhaps be time
to pull off the both sets of tricks.”
Well, we amalgamated. Brassmore and I
were afraid that Elkwortli, sen., had anti-
cipated ns. but The Phantom said “No.”
We worked at his place. Models took shape
rapidly now.
There was never much conversation. Elk-
wortli exuded a silent friendliness which
won us completely, yet at the same time
it contrived to check yarning.
“Bob, lie’s getting more uncanny than
ever !” remarked Brassmore to me after a
particularly word-scarce evening. “Notice
it?”
“Yes. it’s there all right,” I agreed.
“What do you make of it?”
“Can’t say. He makes me feel. .. .Huh !
If I were a dog I would be sitting up and
howling! He’s weird, awesome, like dark-
ness, like the big zone that those radios
squeak in. like a vault of spirits, like”
“Bill!”
Three months went by. They brought dis-
appointment to two of the firm. Our
machine at the trial fell short of our hopes
and we could not see the flaw.
“Hard luck!” said The Phantom, genu-
inely glum with us. “But give me a month
to finish mine and I will be better able to
concentrate on yours. That’s if you are
still perplexed.”
He had been working feverishly, and his
face was registering the strain. A nervous
breakdown seemed perilously near. And all
the while that phantomistic touch was in
evidence. Imagine the bright, lifeless eyes
of a wax figure in a live man’s head; supply
little, odd, disturbing fancies in yourself,
and you will have Elkworth.
“Got your story, Bill?” I asked Brass-
more about this time.
“A baker’s dozen of ’em!” he grunted.
“Dunno what’s coming over me. I dream
about him now. Jimjams—that’s what I’ve
got. TJgh—l almost wish I didn’t know
him. I’ve the feeling that his Daddy is
going to find out —God knows how !—and
The Phantom, in his. remorse and self-hate,
will bash his model to ruins and go off his
rocker!”
“O Lord, Bill!” I said disgustedly.
“Can’t help it. Here’s Flinders-street
Station. Chin-chin.”
Labor was creeping towards a result now.
A beautiful piece of mechanism grew from
The Phantom’s hands in scjuat majesty and
potent mystery alongside the wireless gear.
“Three _ days, three days!” exulted its
creator in a trembling whisper.
The third day arrived. We saw to it
that we. were all off duty at 3 p.m. Elk-
worth had decided on a test before tea. At
o o’clock all was ready. I was shivering
with excitement; Bill sounded shaky of
voice and looked uncomfortable; The Phan-
tom was ghastly, with a peculiar fire burn-
ing behind his strange, strange eyes.
“Anyone working?” he asked, motioning
me to listen at the “receiver.”
I picked it up. “One station. King
Island, by the sound of him.”
He laughed a trifle vaguely. “That’s the
number Fate has drawn in this lottery, is
Jt? Little he dreams! Now, gentlemen!”
He shakily slipped a sheet of paper into his
“recorder” and made two connections with
the “receiver.”
Just then a knock came at the door. We
jumped. All our nerves were raw. The
Phantom actually reeled. “Who—who is
there?” he called out hoarsely.
“A telegram for you, Mr. Elkworth,”
said the gentle voice of his landlady.
It was a cablegram. We knew the en-
velope at a glance.
. The Phantom closed the door again and
regarded it stupidly. "Something from the
Dad,” he muttered to himself. Then he
brightened a little. “Why, of course!
It is my birthday. That’s it. ‘ He
always remembers it. I think I will
open it—presently.” He was incoherent
almost as he bent over the machine again.
“Who was that station? Oh, King Island!
King—ls!”
FIND THE OWNED.
CUSTOMER: “ Waiter! Ere broken a tooth on
this confounded steak!”
WAITER: “Quite sure, sir? I lost one myself
this morning.”
Click! lie shot the “’recorder” into
action.
Magic! Dots and dashes (words to ns)
sprang out on the paper, thrown invisibly.
“My Cod, I’ve done it!” whispered The
Phantom. “Look!” Hut suddenly the sig-

Brassmore, interested out of his disturbed-
ness of mind.
Elkworth surveyed the work with a frown.
“That’s queer,” he said. “Someone is per-
sisting in getting past King Island, yet it
is distant stuff. Wait a second. Very likely
King Island will stop to hear what it is all
about. Ah, I thought so.” The machine,
as he spoke the last sentence, was respond-
ing to the remote man in thin, untrue char-
acters. Its message ran: " Elkworth here.

Thunderstruck, we looked at one another
for the explanation.
“Why—why ?” fell dully from The
Phantom’s pallid lips. He gazed dismayedly
at the now-inactive machine, for no more,
characters came, King Island evidently
being still a listener.
Then, obeying some inward telling, he
looked at the cablegram envelope. My heart
was pounding furiously as he stonily picked
it up and slowly opened it. A compelling
curiosity killed all breeding: we leaned for-
ward and read it with him, Brassmore over
one shoulder. I over the other.

DICK CLAY.
Kearney’s Patient.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WA HAT AII was in a fever of excite-
ment, vague and fearful. A
returned soldier had run amok,
gone stark mad. There had boiled up an
affray in a bar; somebody’s head had been
cut with a bayonet or bottle or something;
and wild, dark threats, a battle with the
police and the taking to the bush of a blood-
thirsty lunatic had followed. After that
there were vague stories of the man’s
armed appearance at lonely farmhouses,
calling on imaginary battalions to
follow him, when blood-
shed was only averted by
the prompt and complete
evacuation of the homes
by their owners. Rumor,
feeding on expectancy,
had already created
tragedies and terrorism
among he settlers on the
hills. “Shell shock,’’ ex-
plained tli 3 bar oracle.
“Ought never to have been
let out of the hors-
pital. There’ll be mas-
sacres, mark me. The
w omen and children
"light to be brought into
town till he’s safe
in gaol. You never
know !” And Waratah simmered itself into
search-parties and defence committees.
Late Sunday evening Kearney got back
to camp. He was finishing off a side-cutting
on a contract for a few chains of new road.
Kearney traced his lineage back no further
than his father, and he died “on Ballarat”
in the roaring days. But I suspect his
ancestors were amongst the masters who
came over and made the first Roman roads
in England—the sort that are still there.
Lacking formal education to become an
engineer, he yet possessed an uncanny facil-
ity for drawing plans and working out
knotty points that more than one shire
engineer had found useful. He would drive
over a strange road in the dark, and tell
you just what it was made of and what
its grade was to a fraction and whether it
was well crowned or not.
As a contractor he was not a financial
success. He treated his men as one Chris
tian might be expected to treat another, and
his commercial dealings were just the same.
Nothing shoddy in work or material ever
got into Kearney’s jobs, and on those lines
you don’t get rich quick in modern contract-
ing. He had done big contracts and done
them well; but he hadn’t done himself well.
Twice his relatives-in-law had come in at
a financial crisis and set Kearney up on
the land: and twice Kearney had let the land
slip quietly to the mortgagees and relievedly
started making roads again. His wife and
family had a fine farm ten miles up the
valley now : Kearney, straight and grey and
quiet at 65, dropped in over Sunday like a
friendly neighbor, and still made roads.
It wasn’t the big contracts he loved best;
it was the little jobs he took on with per-
haps an assistant or two, whejje he could
do as well as direct and put a bit of -his
own soul into the work in hand. All
through rough Gippsland. with its tough
problems, there are patches of Kearney’s
roads.
Kearney had three sons at the Front;
yet his interest in the war was but ordinary
till one of them wrote over and said he
was on road-making work now and told
of the sort of roads they made, and the way
they made them, and the speed thev mad"
them at, and the sort of roads they had found
there when they came. Kearney wrote the
bov every mail after that —-always about
roads. His tent became littered with road-
maps of the war-zone, and at night lie worked
out transport problems as though he were
the general in charge.
About this time he became more bitter to
shire councils than usual. “Afraid to build
real roads for fear they’d last and Posterity
be getting at them!” lie would say. Or
that the present generation would' become
decadent with luxury. Back of all was
the yearning to sing his swan song ere the
years engulfed him. He wanted to build
his song in metal and leave behind him a
Road —and no council had vision enough to
let Kearney build for it his masterpiece.
This Sunday evening, as he unharnessed
the Clydesdale, he scanned his work on
'hand as an artist might a picture while
cleaning a palette. “A decent bit of road
when it’s finished,” he admitted; “but it’s
in the wrong place.” He explained at some
length to old Prince how a survey further
down the flank of the hill would have given
a better grade and foundation without more
labor. Then he surveyed the ford at the
foot of the hill. “Like the place where I
bridged the Tarwin 10 years ago,” he mused
—‘ the bridge that such a crowd of political
johnnies from town came up to declare open.
As if the poor devils of shut-in settlers that
had worked and waited for it and would
have to pay for it couldn’t have opened it
themselves!”
Kearney’s musing, having taken a political
turn, might have gone on like the brook but
for a dramatic interruption. A figure in tat-
tered tailored clothes swarmed across the
road suddenly, scrambled up the bank and
disappeared with a series of yells into the
scrub of the hillside, Kearney let the
winkers clatter to the ground. This rehear-
sal “over the top” recalled the fearsome
rumors from the township. “The mad
soldier!” he muttered, and strained his eyes
for a reappearance.
Half an hour lie waited and nothing .hap-
pened. It grew dark. lie didn’t bother to
boil the billy. Cold water seemed more
wholesome in the circumstances. He ate
ids supper and lay on the bunk in the dark—
with some nice heavy tools handy. All night
he waited and nothing happened.
lie arose next morning wondering if it
wasn’t a nightmare. He lit a fire and began
to wash. Then he stood petrified, soapsuds
dripping from his beard. Down the road
marched the apparition of the night before
shouldering arms of gum sapling. Eyes
front lie passed with military strut. Kear-
ney thought hard. The. soldier marched to
the end of the formed road and marched
back again. Opposite Kearney he halted
and yelled, “Why the Devil don’t y‘ salute?”
‘‘Keg pardon, sir,” said Kearney, salutin'*
and thanking Heaven his sons had taught
him that much military etiquette. “Didn’t
notice your rank. Your uniform’s been
damaged under lire, sir.”
"It has that,” said the warrior, looking
at Ins arm clad in torn blue serge: then
overcome by memories of hot engagements
he sat down on the bank and looked as if
lie was going to cry. The situation called for
action. Kearney busied himself with break-
fast.
I,e S:li(1 presently, saluting
again, Officers mess completely disorganised
it you’d honor”
Before the invitation was complete the
officer had the proffered plate of bacon and
eggs on his knees and had fallen to.
Kearney’s confidence increased as his visi-
tor ate. He followed up the advantage he
had gained with great quantities of but
tered bread and tea, which were devoured
in silence.
-In the after-meal lull Kearnev made i
speech.
"It’s of the utmost strategic importance
that that road be made ready for trails
port at the earliest possible minute. All
the man-power we have must get on the jnli
at once, regardless of rank, or everything’ll
be lost. The empire hangs on it‘for the
time being. That side-cutting now and
here s a pickaxe just about your weight."
He offered the tool from ' the furthest
possible distance and with some qualms. The
other accepted it resignedly. Kearney picked
up another and together they commenced
work. . From time to timo Kearnoy gave
some direction or explanation about the
work which the other obeyed in silence.
Noon came, and again Kearney prepared a
meal, paying deference to liis guest, and
again the guest ate ravenously without
speech. Then toil again till night. Kearney
was jubilant, for he found his companion a
road . artist —-one who understood the
technique of tools and applied them so.
His soul sensed affinity, but not yet did it
grow to words. The soldier stiil worked
and ate in silence, and that night crept
tired to the shakedown Kearney had pro-
vided for him. (Kearney, half ashamed of
ns doubts, went to bed with a light sledge-
hammer handy.)
The next day passed as the previous pile,
save that, the week’s tucker being exhausted.
Kearney made a night-foraging expedi-
tion home and back. The third day two
troopers passed seeking the outlaw. They
questioned Kearney, but neither he nor his
mate had seen a soul. His mate. Kearney
added, incidentally, was one of the finest
roadmen in the State, and had worked with
him off and on for the last ten years. And
because everyone knew Kearney, and be-
cause it was probably the first lie he’d told
in his life, they passed on.
“God forgive me,” he said, “but if they
gaoled him now he’d go mad for sure.
it is, he’s coming back to himself. This
medicine’ll cure him.” And he continued to
cook big appetising meals and .to deal out
steady sweating work to his patient, with
a bathe in the creek at even, and long,
sound sleep at night.
Three days of their combined labor, and
Kearney, much as he tried to make the
medicine last, was compelled to admit the
road finished. Ho debated whether he
should strike camp or keep the establishment
open as a sanatorium for the ex-soldier.
The soldier sensed his difficulty, and next
morning weathered the crisis. For the first
ONCE BITTEN.

time he looked Kearney sanely in the eye.
“I’ve been a bit off,” he said, tapping hm
head and blushing like a schoolgirl. ' 1
don’t know how the hell I fell in with you.
But I’m all right now, and I’d just like t<>
know how I did strike you.” He paused,
further pulling himself together. Then he
went on: “I’d done a bit of road-making
over on the other side. We had some hot
times, and things seem sort of hazy till Il?n«
myself at work on this side-cutting right
near home.”
Kearney gripped his patient’s hand <> s
proudly as if he’d won a war. It might
have been one of his own boys. They too
had made roads over there and been near
to breaking.
Kearney pieced together some links tor
liis mate. Then he added: “I’ve got a con-
tract for a pile bridge and a bit of forma-
tion down the creek. You just come along
and camp with my folk till we can get a
start at it.”
Old Prince, seeing the piled tools by the
dray, came and rubbed his nose on the
shafts and waited.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
H, Cupid somewhere lost a kiss!
He keeps a tally of them all—
He sold one lot to-day, but this
Has paid no price, so Love will call
At every window as he goes
And pry into the reddest rose!
Cupid has somehow lost a kiss!
His ledger proves the loss too clear.
No record kept of that brief bliss,
He searches faces bland, austere.
But it is searching in the dark;
No cheek betrays that secret mark.
One kiss a woman gave for gold.
And one seemed worth a diamond ring;
That for a fair unfaith was sold.
This that forgiveness it might bring;
But from the perfumed pedlar's pack
One kiss has strayed and not come back !
I search the faces in the street.
They seem on business thoughts intent.
Does one betray a knowledge sweet
Of something gained, for nothing spent—
VVith C.npid at his; balancing.
Biting his pen and muttering?
It may be somewhere in the air!
Is Cupid sure his bale was whole?
borne sly thorn may have pricked a tear.
Some green bough, leaning from the bole,
Ripped resined way through Cupid’s bag
And lifted treasure from the swag?
An aster may have hidden it
Under a petal’s amethyst;
Some butterfly have bidden it
To independent flight, unkist;
Some evening cloud conceal it still
In crimsons on a sunset hill.
Or....did it drift into this room—
A spark that fell from burning blue;
Or ambushed in a bunch of bloom.
Bight on my lips, then cling to you?
I think if Cupid comes this wav
We’ll file our schedule for the day!

M. FORREST.
The House of Life.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MR. OCKY was 21 years old before he
discovered that Mr. Nature, one of the
owners of the House of Life, was
leally and truly glad to have him as a pupil.
Lp to that age Mr. Nature had regarded Mr.
Ocky as one who had no time to think of
the House of Life, or of how he got there,
or what he was doing in it; or of the
fact that he was to be evicted when his lease
expired. At 13 he left school and worked
in a factory, and the factory ate him and
ground his bones to make bread. After a
day in this mill he was able to hold his
head up with one hand while he fed himself
with the other. He dozed while eating, so
that bread and meat tasted alike; and as
soon as he was filled he stumbled to bed,
like a tired bullock to the shambles, and
bathed his weariness, that ached like
wounds, in the coolness of the sheets and
the liniment of sleep.
/ ears Mr * Na . ture ’ as hereinbefore
mentioned, was conscious of Mr. Ocky’s
existence as a tenant. Mr. Ocky was now
foreman packer; his wages 70 shillings per
week, his other reward a fortnight's annual
holiday on full pay. It was the first holiday
he had ever known since the days of school.
la.? , W °!Z his n ® w suit —grey with a little
black stripe and new brown boots; a two-
fold collar and a necktie made in Manchester
from, a Lancashire idea of Japanese art;
and one of those straw hats called boaters—
good to provide the amusement of others on
windy days, and with a hard, sharp rim
excellent in any row as a weapon of
offence. Mr. Ocky had a big nose with
Hope writ large all over it; his small
eyes were wide apart; his forehead and
his shallow eyepits bade farewell to the pos-

THE ARTIST: “Oh, no. Mostly from the
wife.”
sibility of any force of language or great-
ness of imagination.
He felt in his pocket for the return half
of his ticket to Melbourne, a terrible 10
miles away, and was glad to know that he
was not really marooned here in the ti-tree
scrub between the limitless -bay and the
boarding-house lie had half decided to lose
two weeks in. Certainly, if so he did, the
return half of the ticket would be valueless,
though, again, had he not to return to Mel-
bourne lor wardrobe for the holiday? And
this being .so, the return half of the ticket
was not valueless: the sixpence half-penny
was still his.
Yet that boarding-house! It wasn’t
homely. It looked to the sea like a white-
faced and hopeless bald man, because
modern improvements had destroyed every
tree around it, and it was of that stucco
order of architecture which, as Florio says,
makes houses of bread-crumbs. Mr. Oeky
loved trees without knowing it: the gnarled
and gale-twisted ti-tree soothed and satis-
fied him.
SO INCONVENIENT.
“Could I see your best silk stockings?”
“You could —but Em not wearing them to-day.”
A fortnight’s holiday was fine —and very
fine this Monday morning, without juniors
from the departments coming into the enter-
ing-room crying the owners and destinations
of their burdens.
* * * *
“Hey, Vic! Wait on!”
Mr. Ocky turned to the voice and saw
in the ti-tree aisle before him, and 50 paces
away, a man and a girl. Mr. Ocky under-
stood their relations at a glance—they had
exchanged hats. Then from the hiding ol
an overhanging tree Mr. Ocky saw Vic emerg-
ing ; she was but a dozen paces from him,
and Mr. Ocky saw, without knowing that
he saw, that she had beautiful black hair,
an oval face, a pretty chin, a good skin, and
a slight, supple figure.
“Hey, Vic ! Wait on !”
She turned her head to answer them, but
continued to walk toward Mr. Ocky.
“No!” she replied, shouting—“two’s com-
pany ! I’m no gooseberry.”
“There’s a nice girl,” whispered a hew
voice to Mr. Ocky; and Mr. Ocky turned
and saw nothing but sky and sea and ti-
tree. The voice had been indefinite as
the light wind in the trees.
“Who are you?” said Mr. Ocky deep in-
side, of himself, for somehow he knew that
the invisible who addressed him must be deaf
to speech.
. m Mr. Nature! I’ve known you a long
time. They call me ‘the still, small voice.’
If a man is sick or found out he calls me
conscience. You live in my house.”
“Where’s that? In Sydney-road?” asked
Mr. Ocky, trying to catch him ; for he be-
lieved Mr. Nature, to be a confidence-man,
which indeed he is—a cozening; scoundrel
with a gold brick, and his buttoner is Life
the Stringer-on.
“Anywhere you are,” whispered Mr.
Nature. “Never mind that. That’s a nice
girl, isn’t she?”
uot at all surprised
to find himself agreeing with this person,
whom he naturally and justly suspected of
irresponsibility and impudence, and of not
being quite decent and respectable.
xr I V ( i ok at her chin >” whispered
Mr. Nature “She’s got good eves,
too. You 11 see em when she lifts
that silly hat. It’s only made to
hide her face, so that vou’ll want
to look under it. Doesn’t she walk!
She s wearing a slashed skirt, too
see where the petticoat opens
near the middle of her calf.”
“Shut up!” said Mr. Oc-ky. “You
ought to be ashamed of yourself.”
She’s a nice girl, anyway,”
whispered Mr. Nature.
“Vic, wait on ! We’re gong to
have some lunch.”
“All right.”
She stopped a few paces from
Mr. Oeky, and turned her back to
face her pursuers. Mr. Oeky
knew that it was a very nice back
without Mr. Nature saving it out
loud; but he was verv angry at
any suggestion that he 'should 'look
over this girl’s points, and pull
her to bits, mentally. He merely
felt that she was a nice girl—a Very nice
girl—the nicest girl in a world where nice
girls are as common as Cootamundra wattle
in July.
The couple who had exchanged hats hur-
ried up to the very nice girl, and the man
called to Mr. Oeky, “H’lo, Bill!” Then
Mr. Oeky recognised, with a strange pleas-
ure, that this man who called him impu-
dently “Bill” was a packer in “The Lane”
for whom he had a very wide and deep dis-
respect. Strangely enough the disrespect
changed quickly to tolerance, and in the
flash of an eye to liking. He replied almost
warmly, “Hullo, Tom.”
"Bill Oeky,'’ said Tom. “Me friend, Mr.
Oc-ky, me girl. Miss Stork. A r ic, this is me
friend, Mr. Oeky—me girl’s cobber, Miss
Duveen.”
“She is a very nice girl,” said Mr. Nature,
deeply intimate; and Mr. Oeky found him-
self shaking hands with Vic Duveen ; and as
Mr. Nature prompted him, he looked under
the, tremendous hat, and saw that
Nature’s forecast of her eyes was true. The
four ate together—sandwiches made of ham
from an angel, tea which was nectar, and
bread grown in the Elysian fields.
After lunch they lay in the golden ribands
of the Cape-weed. Mr. Ock.v’s hand fell
on Vicky Duveen’s and stayed there. She
did not draw it away.
“My word, yous two’s gettin’ on.”
“Mind y’r business, Tom,” .said Miss Stork.
“Two’s company.”
* * * *
Vic and Mr. Ocky, gilded with youth,
walked in the ti-tree, which has seen cen-
turies of life—life beaten into it in pain and
stress of south wind, west wind and north
wind. Myriads of metallic blue and green
beetles, six-legged and bronze of belly and
shard, crowded the ti-tree bloom, rose from
it in iridescent clouds, flashing their bronze
green in the sunlight as they attacked the
spear-shaped awns of the nodding gi-asses.
The gold of the Cape-weed was their car-
pet, the fluffy yellow globes of the wattle
over-arched their path; flute of magpie, lilt
of blackbird, chatter of little melodists the
size of a thumb came to be their orchestra ;
and everything was making overtures. They
walked in a tent of green and white whereof
the fluted columns of the ti-tree were the
king-poles ; there were gleams of a hazy sea of
the softened blue of steel; the Gape-weed was
a lawn of saffron stars fallen to earth ; and
a bee in every
black-centred daisy.
They went from
sunlight to a cathe-
dral of blossom, to
a lusher green in
the dappled gloom
of the thickets. A
skylark sang high
above its nest;
they entered a n
irregular avenue of
ti-tree fluted like
the. pillars in a
cloister of Milan;
their feet dispersed
th e seed-cases o f
the Cape-weed to
the earth that had
been waiting for
Vic and Mr. Ocky
to walk that way,
so that next spring
might blow again
with beauty. The Cape-weed threw its gold in
little tongues, making a running fight with
the darkness of the aisles; then came little
silken stars of forget-me-not blue, to whom
Death must come with the summer heats,
although now they bloomed as if they must
bloom forever; through the quiet, and the
green, and the gold of blossom to a glade of
ti-tree beaten over and growing at right
angles to their roots, but still glad with
life, though middle-aged, because from stress
they had won strength.
"All right,” said Mr. Nature to Life the
Scene-shifter. “No, wait a minute! Another
Cape-weed there, and a bee in it; get me a
sunray on the opposite side—an amber spot-
light will do. Not white! Amber! Hurry!
They’re ready to come on! Just a minute!
Bring the children on now —dead centre!”
Vic Duveen and Mr. Ocky entered the glade ;
and there to all the still beauty of the
thickets and the aisles was added life: the
bee over the quite correct petal as if he
had rehearsed it; the amber spotlight shaft-
ing through the leaves; and on the gleaming
carpet of the grass, little children playing,
their poppy-tinted faces yellowed by the pol-
len of the Cape-weed.
“Oh!” sighed Vic Duveen, as Mr. Ocky
kissed her. Nature and Life the Scene-
shifter stood on the empty stage and watched
them disappear in the winding and intermin-
able avenues.
“Change the lighting. Ambers to whites
and greens—the next two like moonlight,”
said Mr. Nature.
Mr. Ocky leaned over Mrs. Ocky. who had
been Vicky Duveen. She did not hide her
eyes under a tremendous hat now, for she
had got her man. She had got a man-child,
too—a beet-red man-child lying in the crook
of her arm.

isn t it? Me an’ you, an’ this?”
’Yes, dear D’you remember what a lovelv

"Yes, Vic.”

"I hate the feller; but I seemed to Ike
him that day.”

chuckled to Life at the sudden likings of
that day for anything and anybody, to be
thrown down immediately after service—
these things were no secret to him.
Alone with Mrs. Nature, who was her mid-
wife and her nurse—Mrs. Nature, the broad
and often Saxonly and shockingly indecent
Mother Gamp of all new mothers—the wife
who had been Vicky Duveen told herself she
would be the fashionable mother of one.
“Quite right, too.” said Life, the Stringer-
on “Eugenics is the game. Perfectly safe
and comfortable. Only the effective 'birth-
rate and the production of the tit—and all
that sort of rot,” he added under his breath.
“Men and women,” said Mr. Nature, “are
not prize Berkshire pigs, unless sometimes
they are very rich and well-connected; nor
Clydesdale horses; nor prize angoras, unless,
of course, they are municipal councillors.
The bull doesn’t write poetry to the cow • but
some men write poetry to some girls, and
all men think it. And the stage hasn’t to
be set for the boar or the muscovy duck. But
if I had left out that extra-lady Cape-weed
and the supernumerary bee, or forgotten that
spotlight”
*‘ Mr - Ocky might never have married
Vicky Duveen,” Life finished it for him.
“Yes, but she seems to be joining the
fashionable strike,” Nature said.
“She .says so,” grinned Mr. Life the
Stringer-on. “I humor her. Leave it to
me.”
Some months later Mr. Life made to her
the new proposition.
“No! One’s enough!” said-Mrs. Ocky.
“Just this one,” pleaded Mr. Life. “Only
this one. I’ll never ask you any more.”
“All right,” she said weakly. “But it’s
got to be a daughter.”
So Life broke down all the defences tlx*
brain of man has builded for man’s comfort.
After two, three is natural: after three, six
is almost inevitable. Mr. Ocky found each
year for six years a new mouth crying till it
was filled; a new life arriving with the
regularity of a reliable express train and the
certainty of Christmas Day.
* * * *
Mr. Ocky had only three children when his
wife pressed him to destroy that malignant
thing the landlord by purchasing a house.
Mr. Ocky thought lie owned the house; in
a year he found the house owned him. His
big nose lost its hopefulness and became
pathetic; he was more reliable, more plod-
ding, more despairing than ever. And when
his family had enlarged to six, he lost his
job and looked long for another.
Mr. Nature called sometimes—whenever
there was a new baby, or if a child hurt
itself, and in its pain Mr. and Mrs. Ocky
forgot their own; or when the work and
worry of a hot day made husband or wife
irritable ; then Mr. Nature brought softness,
and apology and forgiveness with the supper
beer. Once, after long irritability and a
short sulkiness to succeed it, Mr. Ocky went
PRETTY CLOSE TO NATURE.
“Girls put on too many frills — don't yon
think?"
"Urn —I dunno. Can't say Ere noticed any-
thing superfluous lately.”
out for an extra pint in the scjuat brown
jug labelled “Drink to me only with thine
eyes.”
Mr. Life was there always—roaring in the
children, shrieking in them with laughter;
often red-nosed and indecent Mr. Life; some-
times obscene. And once Mr. Life took a
holiday, and sent his brother as caretaker;
and Mr. Ocky’s youngest girl-child died that
night. Mr. Ocky and the careworn and
faded woman who had been Vicky Duveen
lay in the darkness and clasped each other

they played the leading roles on the stage in
the ti-tree, and thanked God that God had
given them something to thank God for.

Mr. Ocky's first real beginning to lose
his grip on life was when his eldest son
borrowed his watch and didn’t return it,
and then took without asking the black suit
bought for Mr. Ocky for the occasion of
his mother’s funeral. Mr. Ocky was sur-
prised to find that he could hold his rage at
the sacrilege; but, as a matter of fact, Mr.
Ocky’s complaisance meant only that he was
beginning to die. Mr. Ocky’s eldest son,
aged 20, lifted the petty cash, despite his
lifelong course of Old Testament and Sunday-
school. He was but six months on with his
year’s probation as a first offender when he
brought Mr. Ocky a daughter-in-law and.no
money. Mr. Ocky could not turn them out
at first; but the new daughter-in-law called

The Studebaker Car embodies
the wisdom of the past and
heralds the progress of the future
WHATEVER feature is retained in a modern Studebaker

has proved its usefulness and earned its place.
Whatever new feature you find in a Studebaker is there only
after long and patient experiment. Studebaker has made a
habit of being first with the improvement that becomes the
fixed, valuable attribute.
Studebaker extends its good tvishes to all users of its cars.
B-ut this goodwill is not only felt or expressed at Christmas-
tide. The interests of the Studebaker owner are always
paramounut —throughout the whole year.

him “the Old Bloke’’ to his face, and
quarrelled with his wife —whom she insulted
with such terms as “the Old Woman” and
“the Old Cat” —and Mr. Ocky. eaten out of
house and home, and oppressed with the
double-fronted, six-roomed Frankenstein,
made them go, astounded to find that natural
affection will not survive all injury, and
that he cared no more for the son —who,
when unborn, had made the father kiss the
mother in the ti-tree —than lie did for the
highly disrespected Tom who had introduced
him to Vicky Duveen. And the eldest son
and his noisy wife drifted out of Mr. Ocky’s
horizon and were seen of Mr. Ocky no more.
Then Mr. Life loosened another of Mr.
Ocky’s fingers from his clutch upon the
world; He took the worn-out wife and
mother who had been Vicky Duveen and
killed her slowly, as one may drown a cat in
a bucket.
Her mouth was dry of long illness; but
when Mr. Ocky moistened her lips with
orange-juice she spoke, her mind thrown back
to the one moment of romance and majesty
she had ever known —the moment when Mr.
Life the Stringer-on set the stage for her
and Mr. Ocky.
“I remember the tie y’ had on that day,”
she said. “We’ve had trouble, but you've
been good; an’ I know you’ll pay up the
house for the children.”
“Oh, finish it,” said Mr. Nature—“l’m
beginning to cry myself.”
“She’s got to wait her turn,” said Mr.
Life. “My brother gets so put out if any-
body interrupts him on his rounds.”
“I can’t live.” said Mr. Ocky. “She’s
gone ! I can’t live !”
The shrieking goods-lift said it; the
packer’s hammer falling on the nails in the
case-lids said it; traffic said it; the train
said it. The air was filled with its rever-
berations—“l can’t live ! I can’t live !”
The habit of 25 years broken into frag-
ments ; no more the sympathetic eyes to
meet til. eyes of sympathy; nobody training
the convolvuli over the little trellis as he
came home in the evening; a hireling in
the kitchen; children crying “Mother” and
Hireling answering, “Out o’ this, y’ little
devils, standin’ on me clean floor!”
“I can’t live!” said Mr. Ocky.
But there came a day when Mr. Ocky
didn’t want to die. Time dulled him, and
his smallest boy had won a scholarship. Mr.
Ocky’s only surviving daughter had married
(“Thank God!” said Mr. Ocky, who had
been afraid for her ever since her mother
died), and Mr. Nature and Mr. Life were
busy with his memory, making him forget
the old lives in the new. Mr. Ocky had
the new hope of his boy, who of all of them
was as sympathetic to Mr. Ocky as had been
\icky Duveen. And while lie was enjoying
the Indian summer of hope—which is mostly
ambition for somebody else—Mr. Life, who
had taken Mr. Ocky’s teeth and much of his
eyesight and the old-time excellence of his
digestion, and had melted the pith out of his
arms and the straightness from his back and
HIS HOPELESS PASH.

NITA : “Yours, beloved!”
legs, tried to take tlie last toy from Mr.
Ocky's hand —the Instinct of Living. Me
Pulled gently at first, but Mr. Ocky resisted
and he pulled harder. Mr. Ocky resisted
still, and Mr. Life was annoyed, and threat-
ened to send for his brother.
“Not yet.” pleaded Mr. Nature. “He’s
been a good chap, and the boy will win all
along the line.”
“No ! He goes—-I want his room.”
“But lie’s full of me—not yet!”
. There s a couple over there seeing me
in each other’s eyes,” said Mr. Life slyly.
“Come along and .set the stage then,”'said
Mi-. Nature eagerly.
Mr. Ocky awoke, and found his arms were
straight down at his sides, and bound loosely.
He could not open his mouth to cry out;
for his jaws were tied up with linen, and he
lay stretched upon his bed. He arose with
difficulty, found the door in the darkness,
and crossed the little hall. The room oppo-
site was his son’s; a light burned in it; he
heard the sobs of the beloved, and stood
before him.
“Don’t cry, son. It’s me, Dadda,” he
sard.
Grief for the mourned turned in a moment
to horror of the returned; the boy, shriek-
ing his affright, darted past Mr. Ocky and
ran into the darkness, calling for help.
Mr. Ocky’s heart turned to water; the
beloved was afraid of him—did not want
him. Mr. Ocky felt terribly alone.
A hand of steel caught his arm and forced
him back to his own bed; another hand
groped for his throat; in the beam of light
from the hall he saw the face of Mr. Life
transfigured with rage and hate.
“Didn’t I warn you off?”
“I want to see my boy grow up.”
“Didn’t I tell you your room was wanted?”
snarled Mr. Life. “Your daughter-in-law’s
new baby is nearly due and your eldest son
comes here to-morrow. Die, you worn-out
fool, die.”
“But I thought you were Mr. Life,” gasped
Mr. Ocky; “not your brother!”
“I am my brother,” said Mr. Life. “I’m
Life and Death, too. Die !”
“I don’t want to die,” panted Mr. Ocky—
I want to live.”
“He gave me a lot of trouble,” said Mr.
Life next day. “I sent him gently at first;
he came back, and then I got wild. I half-
choked him, but he made such a noise I
thought that that busy-body Science would
come to help him, so I just took him by
the neck and ran him out.”
“He wasn’t a bad sort,” said Mr. Nature,
lliere was plenty of me in him. Are you
coming down the beach? There’s a picnic
just, arriving—girls and young men.”
iSpnng and I set the stage last night,”
replied Mr. Life. “But I’ll come all the
same and see the fun.”
At that moment a few miles away some-
body was intoning “Earth to earth. Ashes
to ashes,” and the clay rattled on Mr. Ocky’s
corhn. «
Mr. Life, the Confidence-man and
ptringer-on, walked gaily through the ti-
tiee whistling for new Ockys and new Vies
to come and be hunted.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FINGERS of lightning fumbled about
the horizon, and then, like a great
hand, darted up into the black sky
and seized the world, hurling it back into
a daylight which was brighter than day.
Ihe ranges tossing in an endless sea, the
white spear of road, the steady trees,
sprang suddenly into vision with a distinct-
ness that hurt. The man on horseback
bowed before the blaze of light and shivered.
The thunder leapt roaring from hill to hill
and set the air in the valleys—the heavy, vel-
vet air—trembling, and then the rain in big
splashes beat upon the leaves and thudded
in the dust of the
load. A great
wind came roaring
through the endless
legions of the
trees, shaking them
with its passion,
driving the rain
before it, turning
the mountain world
into a place of
shrieking demons.
“God!” said the
horseman, “I’m in
for it.”
He buttoned his
coat closer, turned
his collar up about
his neck, pulled his
felt hat over his
ears, and urged his
horse on. The
thunder cursed
him, the rain snig-
gered and the
lightning pointed
its jeering fingers
from the heavens.
The horse, a
drowned, affrighted
thing, splashed
through the mud
where the dust had
lain like a carpet a
moment before.
Five miles be-
hind and below him
the township was
a place of gleam-
A * in g windows
and shelter. lie could see it in his brain,
and his chilled body longed for it. lie had
held out that he could do the 12-mile ride
before the storm; he had backed himself
against the elements and he had lost. The
reckoning was evil.
“Mother Mahony’s house, at the six-mile—
they said I’d shelter there.”
lie could not say the words, the winds had
tied Ins lips, but he thought them. Where
was the house? Where was it? He had
ridden not six miles, but IG. Where was
the hovel of this old witch-miser whom the
fools feared? He’d get in out of the wet,
ne would ! He'd always been good at that
and he wasn’t frightened of her. The rain

"ith ears flat and straggled mane and
taU, the horse fought on against the gale,
and the man tried to warm himself with
curses. Ihere was a rending crack in the
g oom, a shattering of wood, a crash above
the storm, and a tree had gone. Perhaps
drw ne - Xt h oUld | a |!, u P°n him, pinning him
down in the mud like a worm. Where was
Mother Mahony s house? In truth the old
hag must be a witch and had lifted her hut
on her back and flown away with it!
Before him, but so far above that it looked
a Si'eat star in the skies, there was a
fitf" l yellow glow, barred by the silver of
the slashing ram. So that was Mother
Mahony s house—a thousand feet up. a thou-
sand miles away! It vanished, it reap-
peared, but gradually it grew closer. The
horse went up and up, and the rider felt
like a burglar scaling the shaft of a coal-
mui® in the darkness of a dream. And then,
.suddenly, sharply, he was upon it. He had
stumbled off in the clearing by the roadside;
he was beating on the door with numbed
fists. The door swung open and was re-
placed by an oblong glory of red light and
warmth. A head appeared and studied him.
"Tli’ 'orse, ’th ’orse!” cried the head,
frilly, and the man stumbled blindly in
the direction indicated. He found a \lry,
bark-roofed place, which smelt of bags and
dust, and he drove the horse in and fled for
that alluring, beckoning light. The rain
thrashed him as he squelched through the
mud; it flung its last silver lashes after
him as he dived into the hut and slammed
the door, dropping the great bar into place

A log fire was leaping and dancing on the

shadow enveloped in a cloud of steam. The
shrill voice chided him back to life again. .

you . Take off your coat and things. Leave
yourself just decent. Dry yourself, you
drownded thing.”
He did as he was ordered, and then in his
singlet and trousers Scorched himself in
the heat and felt the blood going through
-him like wine—sniffed the steam which
lose from him and the breath of singeing
seige as though it had been incense. When
he turned away from the fire, satisfied at
last, he found old Mother Mahony sitting
theie on the edge of the gloom, watching
um with quizzical eyes. She was a mascu-
line hag, short and squat, with bare, hairy
arms and an unkempt head. Her clothes
were as old and worn as the stone chimney,
tefie saw him draw away from the fire, and
she brought herself and her chair forward
in a bound, like a black spider. With a
booted foot she kicked a chair to him.
“vmT n!’ 1 ! b ? a b^ er she remarked,
you drownded thing!”
Ihe man was tall and thin, with a long,
peaked nose and black eyes peering along it
m a way which suggested that they saw
everything His curious glances swept the
.. a . owner —quickly, searchingly.
‘‘Satisfied hey?” sneered Mother Mahony,
and then without waiting for a reply: “Not
f? at 1 cares, for no one stays with me but
them the storms fling up—the riff-raff, the
diiftwood. Them must take what comes!”
She pulled a tin of tobacco from her
blouse, rolled a cigarette, tossed it to him,
rolled another, and lit them both from a
piece of wood from the fire. Then .she pushed
a bottle across the table and indicated a
pannikin.
.“ Go on, drink!” she said. “You’re a pool
thing, though. You’re not worth it.”
In silence, watching her with his curious
eyes, he filled his mug half-way with raw
spirit and gulped it down. The scalding
mouthfuls lit the fire again in his veins.
Mother Mahony pulled the bottle over and
helped herself to a full measure.
“Great, by God—ugh !” he gasped. “That’s
better—better ’n anything.”
“Y’ave a tongue in yer ’ead,” chuckled
his hostess over her mug.
The man nodded cheerfully. The warmth
was all through him now. He was tingling,
enveloped.
“That’s so,” he said. “I’m getting it back
and not wanting to quarrel with a friend.
Lut you’ve got a tongue yourself.”
Mother Mahony spat into the flames with
care, and sent a cloud of smoke pouring from
her throat before she answered him.
“No talk —no back-talk, mind ’ee. Out y’
go if I get that. Listen !”
She held a stumpy finger up, and all the
world outside seemed to throw a challenge
into the hut. The thudding rain, the hun-
gry wind and the angry thunder clamored
about the place. The man .shivered, but he
smiled a little. He was inside now. This
old woman—he’d put her out first: that’s
what he’d do if she got too funny.
“None of that, now!” The order came
sharply, like a rap on the knuckles. It w r as
as though she had read his thoughts, and his
bold eyes flickered before her rage.
‘ A stranger to these parts you’re being to
try jokes with me. I’m a bad old woman
mind ’ee, an old hell-cat, a black ’un—that’s
me.”
She sat there with her broad hand on her
knees, and the man agreed with her. As
though satisfied with his unspoken fear.
Mother Mahony pushed across the bottle and
again he drank, but this time was satisfied
with less. The woman drank the full
measure.
“Passin’ through, hey?” she said, more
cheerfully. “Told you about me down be-
low, I’m thinkin’—poor bits of dirt! It’s a
wonder y’ didn’t go through the storm rather
than be facing me.”

Mother Mahony wa s

watched her with interest,
and his lids trembled for a
second as she told of
her hiding-place. lie stopped
that tremble firmly, and was pleased to
see _ that Mother Mahony was too drunk to
notice it. He let her go on, but there was
nothing else of use —nothing.
“Bed now—bed,” she mumbled at last
with the weariness of an unwound clock.
“ ’Tain’t respect’le, a young man and me
in this hut—but I’ll be behind the canvas
and you'll be on the floor here or on toe
table if you like it better. And”
She was gone, a. muttering mass of abuse.
It was the man’s turn to spit into the fire,
and then he watched the blaze darkly. The
storm was dying down as though it too
was tired. The other side of the road, hey?
With considerable noise he stretched him-
self in the shadows near the door and list-
ened to Mother Mahony breathing deep and
slow. The gale blustered less and less, tno
logs sifted down as the flames devoured
them. Once the man dozed off, but his will
was strong, and he dragged himself back
out of sleep. It would be worth while —a
little effort and he would reap. Mother
Mahony’s breathing was as regular as time,
the fire was a red heat, the storm had gone.
Noiselessly he wormed his way to the door
and lifted the bar; there was something
in his confident movements which suggested
experience. lie closed the door behind him
and wedged it with a chip of wood. The
night was as black as the pit; the gloom
weighed upon him, but with eager steps he
went across the clearing.
Mother Mahony, wide awake, lay with her
head on her hairy arm and chuckled.
“Men— things /” she said, “The salt is
eaten, the storm is gone, the use is done
and—then—let us steal!”
She drew the butt of a - cigarette from
beneath the pillow, lit it and lay smoking
in the close stillness of the hut.
* * * *
The children going to school had never
seen Mother Mahony so wild with mirth.
She was sitting on the jaw of the cliff which
edged the road outside her hut, and she was
laughing.
“A good trap for them—to use and rob
—but he went down. His bad eyes—to use
and go! He would have robbed me who
sheltered him. Men— things!”
A LITTLE FADED.
“He was born in the purple .”
“But I'm afraid he teas brought up in very
pale lavender.”
Far below in the gully something black
was lying broken in the ferns, but the
children did not see it.
“Oh—oh—old Mother Mahony !” they
cried when they were at a safe distance.
Then they turned and fled. But one? greatly
daring, threw a stone at the mad woman.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I "HE VICARAGE,” a weatherboard
I cottage of four rooms with a kit-
chen at the back, stood at the far
end of a by-road on the straggling outskirts
of Boonbi. Dean horses nosed and win-
nowed the dust along the two-rail fence,
and wayfarers were few. Here Parson Swete
snatched hasty meals at irregular intervals
and slept when ho had time.
His housekeeper, Mrs. Callaghan, whose
every fat wrinkle suggested “experience,”
knew a good place when she had it, and never
flew in the face of Providence by quarrel-
ling with her bread and butter. But she
sniffed in secret at the new parson’s High
Church enthusiasm, with its erratic time-
table, and still pursed her lips when cronies
discussed his doings at the picnic; so the
relations between them remained formal,
THE FINALE.
THE STAR ( enthusiastically ): “Oh, why,
there's still some dew on these flowers
HER ADMIRER ( absent-mindedly ): “Yes, I
know, but I’ll settle up on pay day.”
though she had now faithfully turned his
mattress every morning for a month.
Swete leaned listlessly over the (front
gate, waiting for his tea. He was depressed.
All day out on the plains the sun had been
dreadful, and lie had just discovered that
his fuchsia was dying—the pioneer plant in
the red dust patch he called his garden. And
every evening for a week he had nourished
it on Mrs. Callaghan’s greasy dish-water
—he was paying five shillings a barrel for
river water and had to economise.
It was nearly dark, but fierce heat still
quivered under a lowering pall of dust and
smoke. The myriad voices of evening were
silent, for the pools were caked dry, and
the tanks and wells were empty and the
grass was ashes. Up the road a pair of
hobbles jingled with unsatisfied persistency.
There was no other sound.
A shrill whistle. Swete turned —keen an-
noyance in his face —to see a boy approach-
ins from, the common in which the road
lost itself. Ho carried a long stick, and
had a sack on his shoulder. As he ap-
proached the gate—
“ Hood evening. Mullens.” Swete said with
forced geniality. “Hurrying home to tea?”
he added suggestively.
For answer Mullens carefully swung the
sack to the ground, climbed astraddle on
the fence, and, taking
deliberate aim. spat on
the dying fuchsia.
The irreverence of
Australian children
often pained Swete—•
not for his own sake,
but for the dignity of
his office. Ever since
the picnic, at which
he had been attacked
by bulldog ants and
had been obliged to
shed his trousers, he
had carried a heavy
cross, and, so far, had
e arried it bravely.
T h e embarrassing
curiosity of the child-
ren, the gross witti-
cism of parishioners,
the winks of the un-
godly on the public-
house verandah, the
outrageous article in
the local paper headed
“A Reverend High-
lander,” the “full and
immediate” explana-
tion he had been
obliged to forward to
his bishop—all these
had sorely tried his
patience ; yet they
were as nothing to
the daily irritation of
Mullens’s aggressive
friendship.
The lad simply
basked in his notoriety
as the parson’s under-
study. W hen they
met about the town
he would cheerfully
turn back for com-
pany’s sake, and if
Swete sighted him
walking ahead,
still there was
no escape, for the alert boy would look
around and beckon, and sit on a fence till
he came up, and whistle imperiously with
his fingers if his victim sought to escape
across a. paddock or down a side street. And
now, uninvited, he sat on the vicarage fence,
expectorating over the vicarage garden!
(( “He off with you,” Swete shouted roughly,
and try to learn manners.”
Mullens stared from the angry face to
the sack and back again.
“Wot’s up with yer?”
“Do you hear me—be off!”
. He climbed down, lifted the sack and put
it against the gate right under Swete’s nose,
and dawdled off.
“Here—what’s this sack?” shouted Swete.
“Crorfish,” answered Mullens sullenly.
All at once Swete realised his
blunder, and, full of contrition,
instinctively did the right thing.
Wait a moment!” he said; then,
rushing through the house to the
tea-table, he snatched up a cake
hot from the oven and returned to
the gate.
. “Crayfish, eh?” he remarked,
just as if nothing had happened,
“and for me? Thank you, Mul-
lens. Here, you must be hungry.”
Mullens broke the cake in halves
and silently offered one to Swete,
who accepted a morsel with a
quick nod of thanks. Mullens’s
hands did not look clean.
There was a silence,
“What bait?” asked Swete at
length. His nature unconsciously
adapted itself to his company.
Now he was mere boy, even to his
drought-stricken brevity of speech.
“Pig’s guts—but they was rot-
ten !”
Swete coughed violently into his
hand and furtively dropped some-
thing behind the gate—for a ter-
rible moment he was mere vicar.
“Claws pulled through before I
could jerk ’em out,” continued the
angler warming up.
“But where did you catch them?
—that is what I’m trying to get
at,” interrupted the vicar, despe-
rate to escape a horrible taste in
his mind.
Mullens’s face beamed.
“River at ‘The Bend’ —you
know, where we ’ad the accident.”
He grinned at the clergyman.
Swete took up his ..cross once
more in heroic submission.
“Good-night, Mullens, and thank you.”
He lifted the sack inside the gate. ' “I’ll
ask Mrs. Callaghan to cook them to-night.”
“They’ll keep a week, they’re alive,”
shouted Mullens from the darkness.
Swete gripped the mouth of the sack
closely as he went through the house to
the kitchen.
“Tea ready, Mrs. Callaghan?”
“Well, if you like to call it ‘tea’—there’s
bread and butter.”
“Oh, that will do.”
“There was a cake,” she interrupted
severely.
Swete’s face expressed sudden disgust.
“You ate the ’ole o’ the last one,” she
said indignantly.
“Yes —yes—l know; but the fact is, I’m
rather tired of cake.” A thought struck
him, and he held out the sack. “Besides,
cake wouldn’t go well with crayfish, would
it? So I gave it to the boy who caught
them, and we may as well have some for
tea.”
“Did I understan’ you”—she spoke with
acid deliberation—“to say you wanted them
things for tea?”
“Well, I don’t exactly want them, but
they’re a present, and we can’t throw them
away, and”—he spoke with sudden emphasis
—“they’re very awkward things to have
about the place. Yes, we’ll have them for
tea.”
“They'll take ’arf an hour to bile, an’
it’s dark now.”
“All right,” he said absently; “I'll have
time to change.”
WARM, WARM, VERY WARM.
“My word, you are sunburned .”
“ Yes, I was at a moonlight picnic, Sunday.”
Ten minutes later there was a sharp knock
.at his door; his coat was off, and by the
light of the candle he was bathing his feet
in the hand-basin.
“I’m goin’ out for the evenin’, which I
told you this mornin’, to me brother’s” —
there was a high-pitched note in her voice
Swete already knew too well. “I’m late
now, an’ the kettle’s bilin’ for yer tea, an’
I’ve put them things in the big pot”
Swete stood up in the basin.
“What! Alive?” he shouted.
“An’ if you’ll take them orf in ’arf an
hour,” she continued, ignoring his question,
“they’ll be a lovely color. Be careful ’ow
you ’andle ’em —them spikes on their backs
is deadly poison.”
Her heavy boots creaked towards the
kitchen.
As she entered, the clergyman, coatless
and barefooted, bounded past, bumping her
hat awry and jolting the lamp she carried as
he rushed to the range.
Fresh wood crackled under the big pot
The water was evidently getting warm, for
there was an agonising clatter within, and
a large claw protruded under the lid, open-
ing and shutting convulsively. Swete
dragged the pot to the floor and deliberately
tipped out an avalanche of warm water and
crayfish. Mrs. Callaghan shrieked, and, in-
stinctively clutching her skirts, the lamp
crashed as she floundered up on a chair
against the wall. Swete, suddenly conscious
of his bare feet, sprang sideways’ to a small
table opposite, and wriggled up. staring
wildly into the sudden darkness.
“Good Heavens, woman, what
have you done?” he stammered,
almost inarticulate with excite-
ment. and vaguely thinking she
had thrown the lamp at him.
“Well, did you ever ’ear the
like of that!” she screamed,
apparently addressing the invis-
ible crayfish that now seethed
and clattered over the floor
with pathetic agility.
“Where are you, woman —
why don’t you strike a match?”
he shouted angrily.
“Never you mind where I
a m”—t he poor
thing would have
gone off in hys-
terics but for the
necessity of grip-
ping the back of
t: h e chair —“and
don’t you call me
‘woman.’ An’ if
you think I’m goin’
to get down in the
‘dark with all them

you’re greatly mis-
took. The matches is on the left-’and corner
of the chimley-piece, and them as wants ’em
can get ’em.”
There was silence for a moment but for
their quick breathing and the animated tap-
ping of claws on the boards.
“Ain’t yer found ’em yet?” she asked
querulously.
Swete, loathing the vulgar woman and his
ridiculous position, recklessly lowered a foot
to the floor. What he trod on he never
knew —a crayfish or perhaps a fragment of
hot lamp-glass—but it was sufficient to wring
from him a cry of mingled pain and horror.
Mrs. Callaghan shrieked responsively—her
nerves also were greatly shaken.
“Wot are yer up to now!” she gasped with
her returning breath. “An’ you call your-
self a Christian, playin’ monkey-tricks on
a lone woman! An’ I'd like to know who’s
goin’ to wipe up that mess! Now I know
wot poor Mrs ’Ogg must ha’ suffered ! I’m
glad it is dark : for all I know”—reoqllin<r

“Silence!'’ The clear, low-pitched voice
found its way through her passion, and sir
prised her into a pause. He continn a
rapidly : “God forgive me if 1 have caused

only wished to save the unfortunate orea
tures from torture. 1 am sorry mv cri-

“Oh, dear! It’ll fester ’orrible,” she
exclaimed, suddenly forgetting evervthing in
the sympathy of her sex. “There’s a nice
clean bit o linen in the dresser-drawer if

bread poultice.” Her voice murmured alone
as though she were talking of the sufferer
to another woman—as indeed she was.
“Couldn’t you get the linen for me?" he
craftily suggested, thinking to use her svm-
pathy as a stepping-stone to the matches
JNot if you was to give mo all Boonbi ”
Her voice rose as her intelligence re-asserted
itself. ‘1 lie idea ! —with me all of a tremble

1 he doors are open ; perhaps tliej are mak-

“I only ’ope they don’t take to climbin’,”
she said despondently.
The movements on the floor slowly ceased.
More than once Swete gently reminded her
ot her strong boots; but the poor old thing
was quite unnerved, and a frenzied crayfish
in the dark is no laughing matter, even to
the strongest minded.
Svv etc also availed himself of this unique
opportunity to speak of higher things, and
his diffident earnestness soothed the simple
soul and reminded her of a similar experi-
ence long ago in England when Callaghan
was courting her and the gas in the church
went out —she interrupted the vicar to tell
linn all about it and the parson preached
in the dark to keep the people quiet till
candles were brought from the vestry. “And ”
she concluded “though Callaghan’s dead these
f u years, I said it to his face, and I say
it now. —’e ’ad somethink to do with that
gas goin’ out. E set beside me larfin all
the time, and ’is conduck was somethink
disgraceful!”
Fortunately relief came before the spiritual
but absent-minded man had time to say “and
now let us pray.” Heavy footsteps ap-
proached the back door.
“It’s John cornin’ to meet me!” she ex-
claimed joyously. “That you, John?”
‘Where the devil are you—parson out?”
lie added apprehensively.
“I am here,” said Swete quietly, “and if
you 11 kindly strike a match—mind the cray-
fish !”
John groped his way to the door, and
struck a match on his trousers. Holding
it over his head, lie peered into the kitchen.
His sister stood on a chair against the wall
and the half-dressed vicar sat on the table
opposite. Both were looking fixedly at the
floor.
“They’re gone !” Swete slipped down and
joyously hopped to the mantelpiece.
“Did you ever!” exclaimed the lady, slowly
descending backwards and sitting with a
sigh of satisfaction.
Swete lit a candle.
“You didn’t happen to meet any crayfish?”
he laughed, but changed his tone when he
noticed the stern expression on John’s face,
and changed it to such good effect that John
soon roared till he had to lean against the
dresser.
“There’s the crorfish!” he shouted sud-
denly.
“Lord ha’ mercy!” screamed his sister,
leaping to her feet and planting her foot on
the chair. But there was no call for alarm.
They lay along the wainscot in huddled
groups, quite still.
QUITE OF ONE MIND.
“I have an awful ache in my tooth!”
“I’d have it out if it was min.'?!”
“Yes, if it was yours so would I!”
While Mrs. Callaghan, now thoroughly
reconciled, was bustling about preparing the
parson’s long-deferred meal, John whispered
confidentially:
“I’ve bin thinkin’, Mr. Swete, we’d better
not say too much about this business.”
“Precisely the same thought had occurred
to me,” said Swete, with difficulty restrain-
ing his eagerness. “People are so ready to
turn everything connected with religion” —
“Oh, it ain’t that." John waved religion
up the chimney.
Swete looked pained.
“It's Ilemma’s good name I’m thinkin’ of.”

Goodyear care in manu-
facture means that the
motorist can be care free
TO extract the fullest pleasure from the
tour or jaunt; to be free to contemplate
the beauties of the scene, or to sip the
delights of boon companionship, the holiday
motorist must be harassed by no anxiety.
During his pleasure trips the motorist often carries a
freight which he regards as more precious than himself
—his family or his close friends. Their safety is his
first consideration. The Goodyear All-Weather Tread
appeals to him because it means mule-foot security.
With Goodyear Tyres —where reasonable care is shown—
puncture is rare and blow-out rarer still. Goodyears become
steadily better and better. Throughout the long year serious,
patient men of science break Nature’s “ stubborn glebe ” in search
of knowledge that will enable them to improve the worth of the
constituent materials. Men of mechanical genius and engineering
skill watch and test to correct or to improve methods of
manufacture. From all these activities comes a tyre unrivalled—
safe, economical in use and teeming with myriad miles.
A Goodyear Cover; a Goodyear Heavy Tourist Tube or
a Goodyear Tyre-Saver Kit —according to th'c extent of
your intended outlay—is a fine present for a friend or
business client.


Eve.
[Foe The Bulletin.]
T FELT the dawn on my eyes
Between waking and steeping.
A wind, old and wise,
Came winding and creeping
Over and under a tree,
Like a morning glory
With fire buds on its 'knee
Telling the lattice the story
Of the rain that fell in the night.
Green fingers of fondling wind
And a small grey light
Growing yellow and kind
Whispered of day and its breaking
And- the wild birds waking
And of other days that came
Running and running after
The sun’s first flame
With months full of laughter.
And I, between waking and sleeping,
Between rest and the kiss
Of the great joy the day had in keeping
Lay still and dreamt, this:
In Eden, twelve white-footed paces
From the cedar’s brown shade,
Girt about with the pansies’ wet faces,
laes a lawn in a glade.
The grapes tumble over and over
On either green hand ;
And the rose trails, a merry pink rover,
And scents the bright land.
Too well had I slept on the red
Of crushed poppies to know
The wonder that came to my bed,
Stealing close, breathing low.
If I wore in my breast a rib less
Would the cedar branch tell
While the air was a scented caress
Between star-bud and bell ‘i
Did They cut with the silver sharp sickle
Of the lucky new moon 7
I felt it no more than the tickle
Of strings to a tune
When the mirth-angel dancing his bow
On the waist of the fiddle
Sets the daisy and rose a tip-toe
With a hey-diddle-diddle.
Hey-diddle-diddle, my bone,
Shaped like a mystical seven,
With a surgical cherub had flown
To make laughter in Heaven!
Twelve white-footed morning strides
Wood from wood the grass divides,
Where mirthful air with leaf and sun
Has many an early race to run.
Up the lawn and down the lawn,
That clings to dusk and smiles to dawn,
The romping shadows come and go,
Tripping heel and breezy toe.
The great vine holds his-bunchy sides,
The giggling roses stoop to see,
The dimpling jasmine peeps and hides
And peeps again around the tree;
And all the sport is made for me.
I watched, but on a sudden came
A little air that breathed a name.
Between the games -I saw her slip,
A rosy finger at her lip ;
And all the pansies bowed in blue
To greet the hush-wind walking through.
The roses blew a scented call
From arching bough to leafy wall,
The trees made welcoming of shade,
The grass saluted, blade on blade;
And, in a sudden ecstasy,
All Eden clapped its leaves to see
My rib come smiling back to me.
Like a swan floating in daffodil light.
Like a star in a purple field of night,
Like lilac scents in a silver rain,
Like' remembered voices under a pine,
Like poplar-trees pn a far plain.
Like the taste of)wild berries in wine,
Of a great sudden she came on me
Twelve strides from the cedar-tree.
Scarce could I breathe the morning air;
The sweetness choked my heart with
prayer.
I saw the yielding grass divide
And surely felt that God had died
On some top note of seraph song
That strained its ecstasy too long ;
Then, maddened to the brink of bliss,
I drowned my rapture in a kiss.
Eve, kinder than sleep,
Eve, fairer than waking!
I had all delights to keep,
All joys for the taking.
She spoke out of red lips
Under great, grey eyes;
And each touch of her finger-tips
Was rose-wise.
Her voice had a silver tone.
Like the singing of deep streams
That go down through mossy dreams
Under a rainbow shower.
Singing of all I had known.
Of all that I could not say,
Singing the garden away.
Till the world was I and she
Under a cedar-tree.
All in a garden old,
Under a cedar-tree,
My eyes half-opened to see
A splendor of gold.
Eve,, white Eve at mn side.
Laughed as my sight grew wide,
Tor all in a garden new.
Looking on Ere. my bride,
1 looked on you!
N.s.w.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Downfall of
Willie Clegg.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TO understand how it all happened it is
necessary, in the first place, to know
something of the topography of the
Hansens’ town* mansion, Bilfils. The drawing-
room, convertible into a ballroom when de-
sired, looks out upon a lawn which slopes in
wide terraces to the harbor. Mr. Horace Han-
sen’s library is divided from the drawing-
room by a parqueted floor across which, when
revelry is afoot, couples jazz to one of those
sit-down suppers for which the family is.
famous. In the spacious main hall, on such
occasions, are light refreshments for the
ladies : and lurking coyly, as it were, around
a dark corner whose gloom is accentuated
by a Japanese inlaid screen which would be
priceless were it not bogus, are to be found
wuisky, brandy and cigars for the men.
Behind yet another screen lie the servants’
quarters.
Willie Clegg was in the gratifying, if at
times over-exciting, position of having so
many women in love with him that lie hardlv
had time to attend to them all. He was
young, tall, slim, good-looking, and his thick
brown hair had a natural wave in it. More
than any of those things, he was rich. His
tastes in womenfolk were varied. There
was the girl to whom lie was engaged—lovely
Enid Glaishhe; there was beautiful Mrs..
Reggie Borseroft, who as beautiful Muriel
B.vke had nursed him in infancy; there
were Tessie de Laune. the newly-arrived
danse use; and Y\ innie \\ indus, his cousin ;
and a few others. The infamy of his moral
character was taken for granted; in fact,
after his wealth, it was perhaps his chief
social asset. A victim to it at the time the
Hansens gave the first of their Spring dances
was dear little Millie Evensong. Millie
was just 19, and her innocence, as expressed
by round blue eyes, a delightful skin and
a habit of asking at dinner- and luncheon-
parties artless questions which filled evil-
minded men of the world with embarrass-
ment, was so pronounced as to be almost
aggressive. Willie was not unconscious of
the impression made by his charms. lie
had, as he would have put it, been there
before. An atmosphere of warm apprecia-
tion and understanding irradiated the atmo-
sphere when Millie Avas about which was as
soothing as it was familiar. He often com-
pared Jthe sensation, in his own mind, to
that experienced after the fourth and before
the seventh whisky. Millie had, in the words
of one of the Society papers, plighted her
troth to Mr. Steven Buck, of Bucking-Buck
station—“good old Steve” to his friend
Willie, and one who but for his incapacity
to remain sober for more than about an
hour after his arrival in town, was an admi-
rable character.
Willie had dined at the Hansens’ on the
fatal night. Steve being, as he usually was.
at Bucking-Buck, encouraging the efforts of
his sheep in various mysterious ways, Willie
had been given Miss Evensong to take in.
Or, rather, as a week-end visitor to the
house and a niece of the host’s, she had
claimed him. During the latter half of the
meal she had sat, more radiantly virginal
than ever, with one of her slender silver-
tissue slippers (at eight guineas the pair)
pressed affectionately upon his unimpeach-
able Burlington-Arcade shoe. A warm glow,
due partly to vintage champagne, partly to
anticipation of the emotional moments
ahead, hung around the young man like an
aura. He smoked his cigar after the depar-
ture of the ladies without enthusiasm; in
fact, in his bemusement, he very nearly let
the maid foist brown curacoa upon him
instead of ’7B brandy. A burst of horrible
HOW DARE HE SUGGEST SUCH
A THING?
“My dear young lady, I hate to tell you, but
I object to your bathing costume."
“Oh, you naughty man! They wouldn’t
allow me to bathe without it."
music from the other end of the verandah
denoted that the keener spirits were already
at it. He rose, smoothed down his lustrous
head with his hands, critically adjusted his
tie in a glass and sought out his latest ideal.
Bilfils has many good points as a resi-
dence. But it is not a good place from the
point of view of eager lovers yearning for
a few moments’ privacy. Mrs. Hansen, a
woman of austere virtue, took good care
when there were visitors that every nook
and cranny of the garden should be elec-
trically lighted. The sitting-out places in-
doors were as conspicuous as grandstands.
“I’m fairly busting to kiss you,” mur-
mured Willie passionately, as he and Miss
Evensong took the floor for their fifth con-
secutive dance together. “But the damn place
is like the transformation scene in a panto-
mime.”
“Poor boy!” said his partner. “But why
do men want to kiss one? What is the sense
in it all? Why not”
“Oh. damn !” interrupted Willie, who in
view of the marked encouragement -lie had
received, felt that the maiden was rather
overdoing it. Millie understood men. Shp
realised that the moment had come to vield
a little.
"Well, if you’re very, very good,” sh*e
said with adorable archness, “and promise to
stop the moment I tell you to. I’ll show you
where you can have just one.”
“Angel!” cried the young man rapturously.
To his astonishment she led the way across
the hall and round the corner of the Japan-
ese ’ini posture which shielded the sterner
stuff in the drink line; and. still more to
his astonishment, the place, with its soot'hine-
half-lights, was indeed deserted. He took
her in his practised arms; but their lips
had hardly met before she violently wriggled
free. In a second she had darted into the
little passage-way which led to the ser-
vants dining-room. Simultaneously Clay-
ton Buck, Steve’s cousin, and Samuel Wil-
bur. lawyer and would-be social star.
TO WHAT BASE USES!
ADDIE POSE: "She's (living me every encour-
agement."
CANDID FRIEND: “I wonder who she's trying
to make jealous?"
appeared. It was a dreadful moment. A
maid came round the other end of the screen
behind which Millie had vanished. She wore
large glasses; her hair was sparse and
sandy; her figure deplorable. Seeing that
there were guests present she withdrew, fall-
ing noisily over her feet as she did so.
"Oh, well,” said Clayton after an awed
silence, "I suppose it can’t be helped.”
Another silence followed this idiotic
remark.
Mr. Wilbur, who had often envied Willie
his prowess with the ladies, gazed at the
young man in goggle-eyed amazement. His
fat lips moved, but no sound came. “A
ginger-haired housemaid ! Kissing her ! My
God !” That was what his face said.
Clayton broke the spell by handing round
glasses* and reaching for a whisky decanter.
“I can’t exactly describe her.” It was
Clayton Buck speaking, and the scene was
the smoking-room of the Ambergris Club.
‘I was drunk at the time. All I know is
she was shortish and fat and had spectacles.
Anything more damnable it would be impos-
sible to imagine. Young Freddy Hansen
told me afterwards that they only let her
work upstairs and in the kitchen—out of
consideration for the feelings of the guests,
I suppose. Wilbur—the bald-headed one,
y know—was with me. There they were,
locked in each other’s arms, as you might
say! Wilbur grabbed my arm. She bolted.
And then, damme, if she didn’t come lack!
Infatuated, I suppose.”
How did Willie take it?” inquired a
member of the interested little crowd.
"Like a man and a sportsman. Never
turned a hair. But then I suppose lie’s used
to experiences of the sort. The best of the
joke, though, came afterwards. We all had
a drink together—no, not the girl, you damn
fool: she’d cleared again—just the three of
us. An’ all the time I could see the moral
aspect of the case oozing into Wilbur: he
used to be a member of the Y.M.C.A.
y’know, before he took to the social life. He
must have told Mrs. Hansen the minute he
left us. Willie was practically hounded out
of the house, and. young Freddy tells me that
Hannah—'his paramour, as Mrs. Hansen
calls her is off home without a reference
this afternoon.”
“A more disgraceful affair has never sul-
lied my roof,” said Mrs. Hansen heavily
to a number of friends who surrounded the
imitation Sheraton tea-table in her hall.
“This young man comes beneath my roof-
tree as a guest, eats and drinks of the best,
and what does he do? My dears, lie dis-
graces it! He”
‘‘M as it anything really wrong, Aunt
Susan? ’ cooed Miss Evensong; "I would so
like to learn. I know so little about such
matters.
"Millie, my child!” cried the older lady,
suddenly aware of the girl’s presence, “leave
us. These things are not for your pure
young ears. As I was saying,” she resumed
when Mdbe had departed, “my roof has been
defiled. And with a housemaid ! If it had
been dear Muriel Borscroft now—there has
been some talk about them, I know, but she
is so sweet one doesn’t mind —or anyone in
our own position in life! But a girl like
that! And her looks! If Mr. Wilbur
naan t told me he was prepared to swear
to it, I should have regarded the whole storv
as a drunken freak of that horrible Buck
man. As it is, the wretched girl has been
dismissed She left barely an hour ago
making all sorts of threats, to which I
replied that she was lucky not to be in
the hands ot the police. And as for Mr
Clegg, never while I live does he pollute mv
roof-tree again!” •
0n bis way to the Cashel Club that after-
noon Willie endured two exasperating exDeri-
mices. Firstly, he was cut by Wilbur. By

OLD violin ! When the dusk is deep,
And night comes down on the dreaming
sea,
You sing me, low, of summer eves—
Of whispered words, and the drone of bees
O’er winding walks in the lilac-trees
1 hat barred the world with their whispering
leaves
From an Eden that used to be.
Dear violin! In the nights of storm,
When the flame leaps up in the dark’ning
room,
You are home, and kin, and a faithful friend.
For all faiths falter, and hope is vain,
And home can never be home again.
Will you sing to me, ever, unto the end,
And lighten the deep’ning gloom?

Previous Convictions.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE was one of those naturally faded
little men wlio can only be described
as vague. He was so vague that you
couldn’t tell, after he had gone, whether he
was dark or fair; and it didn’t matter at
all. I once wondered how he had ever come
to be identified and sworn to. He might
leave you the impression that he had been
exactly the same as a boy.
He blew in, or rather drifted in, on an
eddy of a red-dust storm from the plains, and
came along the path to the gate as a piece
of paper might. I had seen him pause, paper-
like, against the wire fence, vaguely examin-
ing the number of my “block,” painted in
staring white on a black background on an
uncompromising oblong of tin, fastened to
the top wire. We settlers are all numbered
here, just as he and I and the rest were in
other days; and, of course, by what some
call the Irony of Fate, and some the Long
Arm of Coincidence, and others the Thing
that Has to Be, the number by the side of
my gate is the same as the number I wore
then. But the little man didn’t notice that;
lie had got my number in the township, he
told me later. Besides, he had gone by a
good many numbers in his time, and while
doing it; and he had met with Many Such.
His clothes, boots and hat—in fact, all
about him—had such a washed-out appear-
ance (if you could call it an appearance)
that they weren’t worth describing. He
carried no water-bag; but then lie was
travelling along the irrigation channels and
the river. His swag was round and of
unusual diameter, and coyered with calico,
well-made and -harnessed, as amateurs’ swags
often are when they have once learned the
trick—better than professionals’. But even
the swag had a hint of unreality and un-
healtliiness about its bulk, like some city
Domain dosser’s—as if the owner's atmo-
sphere of unreality had enveloped it. To me
it seemed, for the moment, with its sun-
bleached white calico cover, as if it were a
roll of burnt white paper that might vanish
with its owner in tiny flakes of tinder if I
clapped my hands. But this might have been
on account of a bit of absent-mindedness, and
the fiendish red-dust storm along the road,
and the unreality of the great plains around.
He seemed to shed his swag as if it were
full of feathers. It was so dumpy that
it stood on end; and the two-thirds emptv
tucker-bag drooped down against it as a tired,
worn-out little wife might sink into a seat
beside her big husband after a day of toil
and trouble; or as a starved, dirty-white
cat might lean against a squat, good-natured
bulldog, smoodging.
And so the small mail was before me at
the foot of the verandah steps.
“Good-day, mate !” I said ; and as he didn’t
answer, but seemed to be looking at me (if It

could be called looking) in a vacant way,
with washed-out blue-white eyes that had
a chinaware brightness about them, I said :
“What’s your trouble?”
He swung ball' round and down, peeked at
the gravel behind him with his finger and
thumb, a.s a hen does, and as swiftly brought
the closed finger and thumb to his lips, and
stood to. attention. Then he saluted—or
rather his hat-brim jerked downward to
salute his crooked forefinger that jerked up
half-way to meet it. It was a gaol salute,
all right. And the other was a prison sign :
he had turned, in line, to pick up an
imaginary morsel of tobacco supposed to be
thrown over the wall by a more fortunate
prisoner in the next yard, while the atten-
tion of the warder —whom I stood for—was
momentarily diverted.
“I can’t place you yet,” I said.
lhere was a slight flicker of impatience—
or it may have been a shade of mildly sorrow-
ful reproach—in this daylight shadow, and in
a sigh of far-away world-weariness he told
me:
“Previous Conwictions.”
There was not in it the ghost of a note of
exclamation. Even the period was blurred
and faded.
“Previous Conwictions,” he sighed again.
-then I remembered him. He came back
to me on a great wave of thought. Or I
came back to him. He had told me that
when I first asked him what his trouble was •
and we nicknamed him “Previous Convic-
tions”—or “Previous” for short. But “pre-
vious” was a word that could not, by anv
stretch of applicability, be fitted on to him.
Jhe Law couldn’t do it. It cduldn’t even fit
him with “malice aforethought.” Even “sub-
sequent” was altogether too sudden a word
to apply to poor little Previous. It was the
Law that was subsequent with regard to
hmi Brutally so, I thought; but the warders
treated lnm kindly, even gently—or, at worst,
with toleration—as we might an unsociable
poodle that keeps rats and strange cats away
from the place. And the governor gave him
the billet of pantryman in the gaol hospital
when it fell vacant.
I rose impulsively from the deck-chair on
the verandah, stepped down and held out my
M was the ghost of a shake on the
pait of r revious. It seemed as if my hand
was no good to him, and he didn’t know
what to do with it. I might as well have
reached for the froth of vanished beers from
the centre of a dry area.
“Come on to the verandah and sit down,”
I said.
But Previous declined, with the ghost of
a shrug. He seated himself on the top step,
EVIDENTLY.
"W hy won’t she marry you?”
“I can’t think.”
"Oh, that explains it.”
with one heel trailing on the gravel, one
root on the bottom step, and his right fore-
arm resting limply on his raised knee. I
sat on the edge of the verandah, somewhat
similar. Previous talked to people with
his shoulder mostly. That shoulder was
his salient, so to speak; and a point of
mild, reproachful counter-attack that some-
times hurt. Also of too-ready retreat that
left you helpless, irritated, even demoralised.
“Ilad dinner, Previous?” I asked.
"Yes thank yer all the same. Boiled
the billy back on what they call the Hay
Canal, before we struck the town.”
“Who’s 'we,’ Previous?”
“I’.ll tell yer about him presently.”
“Where are you making for?” I asked,
more to fill up a pause than anything else. '
“Hay,” said the visitor. “I want to get
away from some of my previous conwie-
tmns, if I can. Then, after an awkward
gap: “I didn’t mean to come in—l only
meant to go parst an’ have a look at what
sort of place you was livin’ in, an’ leave
something an’ a message. Besides, I’ve got
Dotty with me. There he is.”
lie pointed obliquely across the road, and
I saw a stout man. in white pants and
faded waistcoat, sitting on the bank of the
channel under the transplanted blue sugar-
gums. with something in the grass beside
aim that might have been a swag or might
ha ,Y® been a blue dog. He was much more
solid-looking than Previous, and he had a
broad-brimmed, flat, dirty-colored straw hat
which might have come out of old Darling-
hurst Gaol, tilted feloniously over the bridge
of his nose. It was almost tilted over his
chin; so he couldn’t have had any forehead
to speak of, though lie seemed to have plenty
of back to his head. But that might have
been hair.
I couldn t bring him in.” added Previous
“Why? What’s his trouble ?” I asked,
rhievin, ’ said Previous, resignedly
‘Allers thievin’. He can’t get away from
it like I could. He’s thievin’-mad, I think
He'll thieve anything. He thieves things
that are no good to him nor anyone else. I’ve
known him to thieve wore-out women’s under-
clothing from the line. Yer’d think he was
one of them what they call sexvil pivits-
but he ain’t; nothing like that. Why, back
there on the hostrich farm he tried to ’thieve
the bustle off a hostrich that was outside on
ther railway line; but the hostrich jumped
the railway fence and got away. Dotty got
some feathers off of ther barbed wires
though. He said he wanted to send them to
hi i wife.”
“His wife!” I exclaimed.
“Yes. Tellyer erbout her dreckly. It’s
funny,” Previous reflected, “ter see them
hostriches runnin’ alongside the train, like
some big- women I've seen, instead of goin’
oh: at right angles if they’re frightened
Hostriches is fools all right.
"Dotty wasn’t always like he is now. He
was a fine young fellow once, and a bit of a
boxer a nathlete, an' somethin’ on the
railway, He run and picked a kid off the
crossin an’ got knocked out with a truck
they was shuntin’; an’ his wife married him
tor bein a hero, an’ made his life a hell,
one way and another, and drove him to
drink, an’ gaoled him for maint’nance, an’
all that, with somethin’ else that happened,
and maybe the old crack he got on the head
with the railway truck made him what he
is. He told the warders that, but they
d:dn t believe him —they thought he was
aiders dotty. But 1 knew a woman who
vvas there, an’ she said it was all true —an’
there was no nonsense about her. She
wanted to marry me an’ make a man of me,”
Previous reflected. “But that would have bin
no use—she’d on’v have been chuckin’ up me
previous conwictions agen me every time we
quarrelled. . Dotty was on tobacco when I
first met him in ther gaol, an’ he was good
to me an’ one or two others; so, afterwards.
I didn’t drop him, an’ I found he was a good
feller, only for his rat and his
thievin’. I thought a trip west
might do him good, so I brought
him along with me.”
“How did you get here, Pre-
vious?”
“Well, first I got the tickets,
and we watched our chance and
slipped into the train. (No,
but I thought the police m gut
want to stop us leaving the
city. Previous conwictions,
y’know.) We trained as fur
as the tickets went, an’ then
we tramped, an’ worked when we could, an’
trained an’ tramped agen ; an’ once or twice
we. got a lift in the brake-van of a luggage
train. We worked at baggin’ an’ stackin’
wheat, an’ other jobs. Dotty don’t thieve
vvhen he’s workin’; but that’s only ■ another
sign he’s ratty. He don’t loaf, or go slow
either; so the gangs thought he must be a
pimp. So we couldn’t stay long on any
job.”
I knocked out my pipe and went inside
and got my tobacco tin.
“Talking of Dotty being on tobacco, Pre-
vious—where’s your pipe?”
“Oh, I’ve chucked smokin’,” said Previous.
“The gaol cured me of that —I’ve got no
taste for it. But I chew a bit sometimes.
Ihe gaol makes a tobacco-chewer of many a
clean-mouthed pipe-smoker. An’ a criminal
of a decent, honest man sometimes. An’
that’s about all it does. But talkin’
of .smokin’, I was readin’ a book I found
back in the last-night’s camp (Dotty thieved
it from me, and lie’s got it in his swag
now) erbout a feller that escaped from
•some gaol in England—some Moor—yes,
Dartmoor. The escape was all right, but
then the book got all among German spies
that had nothing to do with Dartmoor, or
any gaol, or this chap, either; so I chucked
readin’ it. Anyway, the bloke steals a
bicycle an’ gets off clear. He comes to
a sort of deserted mansion with a carriage-
drive,. an’ he goes in—he’s dead-beat an’
starvin’; an’ he gets in through the pantry
winder. But there’s a bloke livin’ there,
mysterious-like, with a Russian girl and a
old housekeeper—they’re all mixed up some
way with the German spies; but I didn’t
foller ’em. ’Course the bloke ketches the Dart-
moor cove and has a talk to him, an’ gives
him a blow-out of bread and milk, an’ cold
turkey, an' a bottle o’ wine, ’n’ a good cigar.
(They allers does in them books.) An’ ther
gaol cove smokes the cigar right down to the
butt! All rot —why, he’d been five years in
vaol; an’ even if he could have got down
the tucker and the wine, the first whiff of
that cigar would have made him throw up
his works! Even you, should er known that.
All book-writers ought to be in gaol fer
awhile.”
Previous turned his vague eyes to where
Dotty was looking first up and then down
the road.
“Well, I must be getting on,” he said,
rising stiffly. He screwed his face and
rubbed his conversation shoulder, which had
been up on the defensive all the time, and
now went down with a jerk of his arm.
“What’s the matter, Previous?” I asked.
“Touch of rheumatism? You don’t seem
so dapper as you used to be-—been sleeping
in the wet?”
“Got knocked with a tram,” said Previous
laconically.
“How?”
“The tram hit me.”
“I know that; but how did it happen?
You didn’t used to get drunk.”
‘Nor don’t now. Y —yer see,” he went
on reluctantly and hurriedly—slurring his
words a.s men do when telling about a good
deed performed by themselves which they
don’t expect to be believed —“I went to git
a kid orf the tramline; an’ jist as I got the
kid clear the front corner of another tram
come and knocked me down. I never done
a decent thing yet,” he reflected, “but I suf-
fered. for it afterwards somehow. Still,
savin’ the kid was another link between me
an’ Dotty. He’d saved one an’ I’d saved
one.”
A gust of recollection came to me.
“And you wouldn’t give your name!” I
said.
“Plow’d you know? You wasn’t on one of
the trams?” he added suspiciously.
“No, but a friend of mine was. He de-
scribed you to me —manner and talk and
all—but I couldn’t fix you at the time. He
saw you in the hospital afterwards, and you
wouldn’t give your name there. You said
‘Smith’ would do.”
“So it did,” said Previous.
“But why didn’t you own up?” I asked.
“There might have been something coming
to you. It might have done you some
good. You left the hospital next day. Why
didn’t you give your name and address?”
Again, the shadowy shrug of impatience,
of mild indignation or reproach.
“There was me previous conwictions.”
“Oh, I oeg your pardon, Previous,” I
said hastily; “I forgot.”
HENRY LAWSON.
The Pure Merino.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O^VV! 16 Wellington V a«ey the name
W John D e Courcy Brambleton is
still a tradition—the tradition of
more or fine old Tory -who proclaimed
himsell a YWng, and was really a violent
and intolerant reactionary. To-day his con-
duct or life would quite conceivably brine
about his murder, or have him gaoled, or
at the very least, kicked out of his club'.
But in 18.‘)7 —that sentimental year when a
flapper ascended the throne and the peonle
ot England imagined that they were extra
ordinarily blessed thereby—Captain Bram-
bleton was m his own way, a citizen of Aus-
tralia ot the very utmost importance, pom-
posity and influence. No squire in England
would ever have dared, or ever had the
power, to do the things he did as a matter
of course. And few of them were of w 0
much value or as great a nuisance.
THE INCRIMINATING DOCUMENT.
“What, shickering, Henry?”
“Yes. Life's not worth living! The wife
found a Hack feather on my shoulder
las’ night!”
, He had come to this country in the early
twenties as an ensign in U.M. 3rd Regiment
of hoot—the famous “Buffs”—and had been
all through the strange routine of the garri-
son of New South Wales in those old days.
Guard-mounting at Government House in
Sydney and Parramatta, ceremonial parades
in the barrack parade-ground where the
pretty oasis of Wynyard-square delights the
eye to-day, detachment duty at Newcastle,
Norfolk Island, the Hawkesbury and on the
vv estern-road, and, finally, upon his retir-
ing from the service with the brevet rank of
captain, the commandantship at Emu
Plains—these were the principal items of
his Australasian service. Indeed, they were
the items of nearly all his army service. It
is queer to think that almost the whole of
the record of the years he spent with the
colors of that splendid unit is that of a
gaoler. Yet so it was, and the fact that it
was so is mainly the reason for this story of
his eldest son. For the profession of a gaoler
inevitably induces certain characteristics in
the individual, and heredity accounts for
many things in the individual’s descendants.
At Newcastle and Norfolk Island, he was
never tired of explaining, Captain Bramble-
ton learned how to Keep People in their
Places. One stresses this with capitals be-
cause it is a very important thing to know,
and he knew it thoroughly. There was not
much need of it at Windsor, but he found
it extremely useful on the Blue Mountains
and down at the stockade at Emu Plains,
where the little stone church stands now
with its gravestones round it. When, in
the fulness of time, he became one of the
pioneers of the Western Plains, he was so
imbued with it that he could not conceive
anyone being so contumacious as to deny
him the right to exercise it. And he did
exercise it to the end of his days. The tra-
ditions in the Wellington Valley testify to
this.
His young wife died early as a result of
being kept in her place, and a very weighty
and magnificent granite monument in the
old churchyard at Kelso, near Bathurst,
keeps her there now. With a view to keep-
ing young Paddy De Courcy Brambleton in hi s
place, the captain brought him down to Parra-
matta about the date of Queen Victoria’s
coronation, and left him in the charge of the
Rev. Robert Forrest, headmaster of The
King’s School. He explained to that scholarly
gentleman where his place was, and how he.
Captain Brambleton —lately of the “Buffs,”
by gad, sir—expected him to remain in it.
He was equally explicit with Mrs. Forrest,
and very curiously does the couplet which
the boys of the old school used to delight in
regarding the good and worthy couple bear
witness to the fact that they must have very
literally fulfilled the destiny which he enun-
ciated as being undoubtedly theirs: —
Long Bob and slender Jane —
One gives physid, and the other cane.
“You will, my good sir,” he said, “discipline
the young villain. You will discipline him
soundly. Severely, if necessary. When I
was at Norfolk Island, and at Newcastle, I
learned how to keep people in their places.
I trust that you know how to achieve this
with boys. Boys are worse than convicts —
more depraved. Yes. And you, madam” —to
Mrs. Forrest —“be pleased to dose him when
he appears to need it. Pay no attention to
his likes and dislikes—drench him thor-
oughly, ma’am, when he requires a drench.
I look to you both to keep Patrick in his
place.”
So Patrick Brambleton, possessing a new
five-shilling piece and a soul of an awed but
imperious sort, was turned loose amongst
his fellows, and learned for the first time in his
12 years of existence that he was not a kind
of prince of the blood, hut only a forlorn
little boy of no importance in a savage demo-
cracy that did not care a button for the son
of Captain John De Courcy Brambleton, of
Brambleton House in Bathurst, and Bram-
bleton Plains in the district of Wellington
Valley. When he sought to assert the dig-
nity and splendor of his position by the
simple statement of it, they took him down
to the bank of the river below the big new
stone building with the Grecian porch and

A REGAL
CHRISTMAS GIFT.
No better appreciated, no more
princely CHRISTMAS PRESENT or
NEW YEAR’S GIFT could be suggested
for wife, or daughter, or pal, than a
CHANDLER SIX-CYLINDER CAR.
The CHANDLER is an ideal car
for a lady. This is what a fair owner in
Adelaide writes: —
I have driven my CHANDLER CAR
for 12 months, and consider it an ideal
car for a lady to drive. The gear change
is so simple that it is almost impossible to
make a mistake. I have driven several
other makes of cars, but would not
change my CHANDLER for any of them.
My car has covered 15,000 miles, and the
cost of upkeep has been low during the
whole distance.
“CHANDLERS KEEP FAITH.”
Nothing more descriptive of the uniform
reliability of these truly great cars could
have been adopted as a slogan, for it is
their proud boast that
What One Chandler Can Do
Each and Every Chandler Will Do,
for the simple reason that there is no such
thing as an inferior Chandler; they are all
of like standard and uniform excellence.
Motorists are to be congratulated on the large
number of these cars now forward, thus obviating any
delay in filling orders promptly.

threw him in the water, christening him, in
the gentle fashion of The King’s School,

brown holland garment that was trousers and
jacket in one, like a suit of overalls, and
fastened behind with buttons at neck and
waist. He had a flat-crowned cap with a
leather peak in front and a button on the
top, white socks and black shoes. The
legendary portrait of the Little Boy at
Manly, which occasionally ornaments the
pages of The Bulletin, will give an idea
of what Paddy Brambleton, and most of his
King’s School contemporaries, looked like in
’•j7. It was not till more than 30 years later
that they began to wear the military uni-
form which has handicapped them in orchard-
raiding expeditions ever since.
As for the name the young savages be-
stowed upon him, it was as appropriate,
att ei- a fashion that has become traditional
at The King’s School, as any nickname could
possibly be. Captain Brambleton was a
very typical sample of the arrogant class
of free settlers which had come to the colony
as military officers or with means that en-
titled them to large concessions of land, and
who referred to themselves as “Pure Merinos,”
in contradistinction to contemporaries who
had earned their emancipation from bondage
and servitude by good, or evil, conduct. With
the ideas of his own importance that this
little newchum at the school obviously had,
it was as inevitable that he should be called
“The Pure Merino” as that the writer should
have been called “Monk” half a century later.
Parramatta in 1837 was a very much more
thrilling place than it is now, and the boys
of The King’s School had opportunities of
studying life that have not been vouchsafed
to their successors these many years past.
On the western side of the school grounds
there was a racecourse, and on the eastern
was the gaol. In front of the latter stood
the stocks, and any day of the week it was
possible to see a chain-gang slouching along
Church-street or working on the stone bridge
that Mr. David Lennox designed and built.
Across the river Sir Richard Bourke lived
for the greater part of the year in Govern-
ment House, below which, in that curious
horseshoe where you may just make out its
traces to-day, was one of the finest orchards
in New South Wales. There was a com-
pany of Imperial soldiers in the old barracks
in George-street, and now and then there
were public executions, which, although they
were very properly out of bounds, it was
not wholly impossible to witness. Also,
when you were going home for the holidays
or coming back from them it was quite
sible that you might be bailed up by a bush-
ranger. Even a good many years after this
time William Faithfull and his brothers had
fought off a gang down near Goulburn
Plains. There was some interest in being a
schoolboy at Parramatta in those days. Any-
body might imagine himself to be the equiva-
lent in adventurous enterprise of even such
modern characters as Deadwood Dick. Only
it was Bold Jack Donohoe then.
It was the height of delightful audacity to
take part in a raid on the garden of Gov-
ernment House, over the water. His Ex-
cellency was far from being the mere
dedicator of municipal conveniences, cottage
hospitals and Schools of Art that he has
degenerated into in the 80-odd years since.
He was altogether IT, and to steal his
peaches and plums was a mighty deed that
almost counted as much as breaking into
Heaven and making off with St. Peter’s
office keys, or into the other place and col-
laring the Devil’s pitchfork.
So when, on the day before the school
broke up for the Christmas holidays, little
Paddy Brambleton found himself in the
leafy branches of one of the Governor’s
peach-trees—stark naked, since he and his
four companions had necessarily had to swim
the river—he felt a consciousness of virtue,
a thrill of achievement, that had never been
his before.
Those raids used to be conducted in a
fashion that reflected the highest credit upon
the strategic abilities of the young Austra-
lians who took part in them. In their own
way they were quite as creditable as the
raids which latter-day compatriots were in

the habit of making into German trenches,
and, comparatively, they involved greater
terrors. In the last-named, a man qnly
risked death; in the former' there was the
awful possibility of being brought before his-
Excellency himself by an angry gardener,
and a subsequent inevitable interview with
Long Bob. Far more terrible than dissolu-
tion were these contingencies.
The plan of operations was this. Some
20 or 30 boys would go for a swim in the
river, and, if the garden seemed to be clear
of its custodians, four or five would creep up
the bank, climb the fruit-trees inside the
fence, and throw as much of the spoil as
they could to their companions in the water,
stuffing themselves hastily as they did so.
It may have been the thrill of pride that
FEMININE LOGIC.
“I didn't think it teas such a very bad day—the thermometer didn't touch 90.”
“Oh, it did if you were out in it.”
Master Brambleton experienced—or possibly
mere greediness—that was the reason for
his not hearing the stage-whispered “Cave !
Cave!” which Piggy Bolton in the next tree
hissed to him as he slid to the ground. At
any rate, the Merino didn’t hear it, and first
became aware that anything was" wrong
when a not unkindly voice below him
remarked with a laugh :
“Ah, well, my young friend, when you
have quite finished up there, I would like
to see you down here.”
He looked through the green branches, and
beheld, with a shock of frightful terror, none
other than Lieut.-General Sir Richard
Bourke himself!
It was a hot day, but the Pure Merino
shivered. lie was as a naked soul that
stands suddenly before God —and was very
conscious of his nakedness.
“Come down out o’ that, ye young divil!”
hoarsely grunted another voice whose owner
the foliage hid. But the voice was the voice
of Peter Iliordan, the head-gardener, who
stood behind his Excellency. Paddy slid
to the ground, and stood trembling before
the Throne of Judgment. At the very
least he expected to be flogged and shipped
to Norfolk Island. Most likely he would be
hanged, over on the gaol green. He knew
the terrors of the island from his father’s
servants, and, young as he was, he had
seen a man hanged. Even worse, he knew
that he would have to face Long Bob.
“Well,” said the fine-looking man who
towered above him, “and who may you he?”
For some awful moments the little boy’s
tongue failed to* work. “Hurry up, now, ye
little warmint, an’ shpake to his Ex’lency.
D’ye not hear his honor a-talkin’ to ye?”
Peter liiordan was a fierce old man, with
a face like a monkey’s—a life prisoner, who
was the very best gardener in the colony.
Paddy Brambleton knew all about him. He
had once caught a boy, just as he had him-
self been caught, and had administered a
thrashing beside which Long Bob’s best
efforts were as nothing. Somehow, he took
comfort from the Governor’s presence.
“Shpake up !” growled the gardener again.
“Be quiet, Riordan,” said Bourke. “Now,
my boy, tell us who you are.”
The cowering urchin found his voice,
huskily. “If you please, sir, the Pure
Merino,” he gasped nervously.
“The what?” smiled the Governor. “That's
not your name, is it? Are you from The
King’s School?”
“Please, sir, yes, sir.”
“Oh —then that’s your nickname. What’s
your other one?”
With a great effort it was given in full.
“Please, sir, Patrick De Courcy Bramble-
ton.”
“Oh, by Jove —a son of Captain Bramble-
ton?”
“Y—yes, sir.”
“I know your father well. ’Tis lucky for
you he didn’t catch you, isn’t it? I should
think it was! Well, now, what do you
expect is going to happen to you?”
Paddy could only gulp, and make a queer-
noise—half sob and half groan.
“Why, you look as if you thought I was
going to hang you. How would you like
to go to Norfolk Island?”
Another gulp.
“Well, I won’t hang you this time, my
boy—and there are too many bad lads at
Norfolk Island. I’ll send you with Riordan
over to Mr. Forrest. I expect that will do
as well. He asked me particularly to let
him know of anything of this .sort. But
don’t look so miserable. It will be all over
in an hour or two. Cheer up. If you’ll
come and see me next Sunday—to tell me
what happens—l 11 give you an hour to your-
self in the orchard. Remember me to your
father when you write to him. Riordan,
take the punt and ferry this young gentle-
man over to where his clothes are. Then
take him up to the school, give my compli-
ments to Mr. Forrest, and tell him what he
has been un to. You must go through with
it, you know, Patrick. You’ll never be a
man if you don’t go through with conse-
quences. Do you know what ‘consequences’
are? What is the consequence of this, for
you ?”
The great man was smiling down at him
in so kindly a fashion that the Pure Merino
found courage to answer.
“Please sir, Long Bob —I—mean Mr. For-
rest, sir.”
“Yes, that’s right. Now, be off with
Riordan. And take your punishment like a
man.”
With the gardener’s horny hand upon his
bare back the naked robber of vice-regal
orchards moved down towards the riverside.
They had only gone a few yards when Sir
Richard called Peter Riordan back to him.
“Riordan,” he whispered, “I don't wanl
this boy punished. Find his clothes, see
that he dresses, and take him to the play-
ground. Frighten him a little, if you like,
but don’t touch him. Let him go when you
get him inside their bounds.”
“If ye plaze, y'r Ex’lency?”
“Yes —what is it?”
“Might I not be afther givin’ him th’ laste
bit av a skelpin’ mesilf? Them young war-
mints, they do be worse than all th’ bir-rds
in th’ worruld wid th’ fruit.”
“No, no; do as I say. The boy’s father
is a friend of mine.”
Peter Riordan saluted, prisoner-fashion,
with his forefinger, and shuffled down ta
where the little naked figure stood above
the reeds.
“Thin, by God, ’tis no frind of mine’s
that same Black Jack Brambleton. Th’ ,
!” muttered the ugly old man furi-
ously. “Yis, I’ll frighten th’ young divil,
so I will. I’ll put th’ fear o’ God into him—
f’r ole time’s sake.”
There was not a vestige of the raiding-
party on the further bank, save only the little
heap of clothing that was Paddy’s, piled be-
tween the roots of a she-oak. Terrified by
the frightful news that Piggy Bolton had
conveyed—that the Governor himself was in
the orchard—the boys had dressed hurriedly
and fled to the shelter of the playground
speculating awfully as to the fate of the
Pure Merino. Peter Riordan commanded his
charge to dress himself, and sat down to
scowl at him; chewing a cud of bitter reflec-
tions concerning Paddy’s father.
When the dressing business, was completed
and the boy turned towards the school, the
old man signed him to sit down again.
"I w r ant for to have a wurrd or two wid
ye, me young bucko.”
A little fearfully, the Pure Merino sat
down on a root and regarded Riordan’s
caricature of a face inquiringly.
“What was it ye tould his Ex’lency y’r
name was?” asked the gardener. “Th’ full
av it, I mane.”
“Patrick De Courcy Brambleton.”
“An’ y’r th’ son of Cap’n Brambleton what
used to be Commandant at Emu Plains?”
“Yes.” . -
The old man regarded him for a little
while in silence. This little rat of a child
the son of the man who had oppressed him
and his kind so hardly! It was a bitter
thing that he had not found him in the
peach-tree himself, when the Governor was
not in the orchard. Maybe he would have
been able to give to the son a little —a very
little, but still something—of what the father
had given him. Sure, he wouldn’t have
known him without the Governor’s question-
ing; but mebbe the kid would have blurted
out who he was. He was comfortable enough
in his present job ; but God ! what a time he
had at the hands of this boy’s father!
‘‘D’ye know y’r father nigh had me flogged
to death, one time, ye young blaggar-rd V”
The Pure Merino looked up quickly. It
came to him as a shameful, burning indignity
that this ugly old man had been a prisoner
perhaps was one now—and was daring to
address him in the fashion he was doing,
lie took heart immediately. He would show
this old lag where his place was. He grinned
impudently.
“So you were a prisoner?’’
“Aye, I’ve been a prisoner since th’ time
whin I was but little bigger than what you
are now, me brave boyo. An’ I’m for to be
wan till I die. Elivin lmnerd lashes I had- -
from first to bad last —t’rough y’r divil of a
father, bad cess to him !”
The boy stood up, glaring at the wizened
old man angrily.
“Look here, prisoner, you forget who you’re
talking to. The Governor has ordered you to
take me up to Long Bob—l mean, Mr.
1 ( orrest. Come on. I don’t want to be seen
talking to you here, you ugly old lag. Come
along!”
All his life Patrick Brambleton never
realised how close he was to his death that
summer afternoon beside the Parramatta
River.
The old convict trembled with the intensity
of his rage, and the terrible memories of
things endured that were his. Gropingly, his
right hand strayed over the ground beside
him, sub-consciously searching for a stick
or stone with which to slay this spawn of the
man who had been a devil to him—worse
than a devil could ever have been, he thought.
But he found nothing but the soft carpet of
needles from the branches of the she-oak
overhead. And something in the look of the
sneering young face in front of him held him
back from throwing himself upon it like a
madman. He had had a chance to kill Black
Jack once, and the look in Captain Bramble-
ton’s face had restrained him, somehow.
He broke into a volume of shrill and
furious cursing—blasphemies and obscenities
and infamous perversions of speech and
thought that had been the common language
of the hells he had slaved in nearly all his
life. And when, at last, he had to pause
for breath, there stood the boy smiling at
him, his hands in the pockets of his over-
alls, his flat cap with the little peak pushed
back from the fair curls that clustered about
his forehead.
Exhausted by the vehemence of his passion,
Peter liiordan rose, shakily, to his feet, and
turned his steps towards the flat-bottomed
boat in which he had ferried the boy across
the river.
“Prisoner!” cried the youngster, shrilly.
There was something in the tone that made
the old man turn in spite of himself.
“You haven’t done what the Governor told
you to do yet. You’ve got to take me to Mr.
Forrest. Come. You can follow me up to
the school.
If all your life —or all the days of it that
count —you have been flogged and harried

and tortured into a belief that the only
really necessary thing in this world, whereby
evil may be averted, is instant and un-
questioning obedience to the voice of
Authority, even the parody of it will cause
you to hearken to it instinctively, to obey it,
to take it for the real thing. Because young
Patrick Brambleton was the son of John
Brambleton, the broken old prisoner followed
him up to the front of The King’s School,
■where Mr. Forrest was -walking up and down.
He had no explanations for himself as to why
he did it. It was the only thing to do. But
he felt vaguely that it was cruel—hellishly
cruel.
When he returned to the orchard, Sir
Richard Bourke was still there, seated be-
neath a tree with a book.
“Well, Riordan, did you let him go?”
“He med me take him to Misther Forrest,
y’r Ex’lency.”
“Ha—and what happened?”
“Misther Forrest tuk him inside for to
bate him, y’r honor.”
“By jove,” the Governor soliloquised, as
the old man—strangely bent and weary—
shuffled away. “A young brick ! Indeed, his
nickname suits him. The Pure Merino! Well,
well.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A TANIv-SINKING team was at work
on the edge of a blacksoil plain in
Riverina. Eight clinking good horses
had just brought a scoopful of soil over the
batter as I rode up.
“Good day, mate/’ said the driver. Then
he stopped the team and looked hard at me

Jimmy Cotter and I had been shearing
mates for several seasons, and then we had
drifted apart. We reckoned up: it was
11 years ago. (Bushmen drift awav from
each other even though the bonds of mate-
ship are strong—strong enough to hold
through years of separation.)
We shook hands hard and started to varn.
lhere was a lot to yarn about.
Better make it dinner-time, Bob,” Jimmy
said, turning to the man on the scoop-handle
feo they dropped the chains; and as the
horses headed for the water-troughs Bob
went to fill the feeders, and Jimmy and I
walked to the camp.
“I’ll introduce you to the missus,” Jimmy
grinned quietly. “I never ’ad ’er w’en vou

the five kids neither. They’re up in the wag-
gon there now—at school. We’re a bit
early to-day. I wish we could catch ’em
on the hop at their lessons.”
The waggon, a big flat-footer, was stand-
ing near a clump of box-trees a hundred
yards or so from the tank. A large calico
fly was rigged on it over lialf-liooped sap-
lmgs. It made the waggon look like a huge
travelling circus-van.
Mrs. Cotter heard us approaching, and
came out from the fly and down a short
ladder at the waggon-side. She was a little
woman, neatly dressed in print, with iron-
grey hair and a pleasant face, though a bit
faded.
.Timmy introduced us. ‘‘Missus, ’ere’s my
old mate Bill Summers, that you’ve often
heard me speak about.”
Mrs Cotter welcomed me pleasantly. She
said she had heard my name so often that
I seemed like an old friend. She called to
tne children, and they came scrambling down
the ladder—-fine little warrigals. brown and
healthy -looking. They ranged in steps and
stairs from .Timmy, junior, aged about 10,
down to the baby—freshly wakened and full
of . cheerfulness. I shook hands
with all the children and congratulated the
parents on their bright, healthv appearance
They looked pleased. When I picked up
the baby and coaxed it into infantile shouts
the rest of the family either beamed or
shrieked with joy.
After dinner Jimmy and Bob and I yarned
while Mrs. Cotter put the things away. Pre-
sently she joined us. and listened as Cotter
and I recalled old times and places.
“Well, missus” —Jimmy stood up and
stretched —“time’s going on. What about
school?”
“Nonsense!” said Mrs. Cotter, and
blushed.
But Jimmy was insistent. He was proud
of the school, and wanted me to see the
scholars at work. We all climbed the ladder.
The fittings under the fly were simple.
Along the sides four boxes were arranged
as seats for the children. A larger box at
the front-end stood for a table, holding the
slates and a few well-worn school-books.
Mrs. Cotter had a chair by the big box—
an armchair with half a back and unstable
legs.
She hesitated at starting “school,” but
Jimmy pressed her to commence.
L>-ii 0 on ’ m^ssus - Don’t be frightened o’
Bill. P’r’aps ’e could give you a few points
on some o them lessons. ’E always useter

Mrs. Cotter smiled nervously.
"You see, Mr. Summers,” she explained,
"neither Jim nor me ever had much educa-
tion. We never had much of a chance. I
was out working at 21, an’ Jim—well, you
know about Jim: he was earning his living
before that. But we've often missed the
schooling, an’ we made up our minds if we
had children”—she grew embarrassed and
continued hurriedly—“if they came we de-
cided to have them taught as much as we
could We lived in Hay for awhile, an’ it
would have been all right there, but we only
litid three children then, mid they were too
young for school. After, when Jim got a
plant together an’ started tank-sinking, and
I came out with him. we never seemed to
be near enough to a tolvn to get them to
school; so I’m trying to teach them the
little I ve picked up.” She laughed, a little
nervous laugh. “Goodness knows it isn’t
much ; but it may help. And you’d be sur-
prised how quick they learn!” she flushed
with pride. It—if you like I’ll try them.”
ihere was an interruption. The baby
whom Jimmy had carried up, dropped its
plaything—a big spoon—and broke the
gravity of the scholars with loud complaints.
Ihe spoon and order were restored, and
school began.

and whispered him
to sit down.
“We are handi-
capped, you
know,” she told
me, through not being sure of the words
ourselves. Sometimes I think they are wrong,
but I can’t correct them. I can only give
them very simple lessons, and just get along
that way. But still what they learn may be
handy in after years. I would hate our
children growing up ignorant.”
The little bush mother glowed as I con-
gratulated her on her scholars. I told her
plenty of town children were not as ad-
vanced as hers, and she should be proud of
them. I wondered if they would grow up
proud of her. I hoped they would. I was
proud of her myself—proud to know she was
a bushwoman and Riverina bred.
I offered her the usual consolation—that
the bush was healthier for the youngsters
than town life would be. In the bush they
could get all the sunshine and fresh air they
needed.
“Yes,” she agreed, “it’s healthy here, an’
the children have plenty of freedom. I give
them holidays the same as teachers do in
towns.”
Holidays! Poor little beggars! There
wasn’t even a creek or a sandhill to break the
monotony of their holidays. There was
nothing but scattered clumps of box, and
out past the tank the big plain stretching to
the horizon—and beyond.
For an hour or two after that I stayed
with the two men at the tank. From there
we could see Mrs. Cotter climbing up and
down the ladder as she alternately set les-
sons and attended to the cooking or"the baby.
School came out at 4 o’clock. The chil-
dren raced to the tank, and romped around
as joyously as any town-reared youngsters
do when lessons are over.
That night I sat up late at the camp-fire
yarning with Jimmy Cotter. I n the good
bush way we recalled old times, flush times
and hard times, and mentioned mates we
hadn t seen or heard of for years.
They had made me a shake-down in the
school and when at last I climbed the lad-
der I took out my crumpled writing-pad and
spent—well call it an hour, making up lots
of simple sums, with the answers for Mrs
Cotters benefit, and writing strings of short
sentences for use in the school. I even tried
a few drawings, but they looked so weird that
1 destroyed them. I was afraid the labels
might get mixed or worn out.
In the morning when I gave her the results
ot my labor the little woman almost wept
her thanks. The kiddies danced as if I had
unloaded Christmas treasures on them.

RIVERINA.
A Villain's Confession.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE press is more often than not hostile
to me, I admit; the press-agent
never. But even press-agents and
society gossips err sometimes. For example,
a few weeks ago a very misleading para-
graph about me appeared in print, running
as follows:
Mr. Adolphus Trimmings, the well-known “heavy”
of countless melodramas, is, we hear, shortly to lead
to the altar a widow lady as beautiful as she is
wealthy. Mr. Trimmings’s colleagues and friends
are showering congratulations on the fortunate actor.
This was an altogether too previous
announcement, unfair to the principals con-
cerned —to a public man like myself particu-
larly so. In justice, therefore, to their
humble servant, I lay the facts of the case
before the public. The lady, take it from
me, is quite capable of looking after herself.
Airs. Chilwinkle keeps a select boarding-
house. _ She is a widow of a most unpre-
possessing cast of countenance. But she
knows her business from Ato Z. One weak-
ness, however, she has, or had—an irresist-
ible, unconquerable partiality for stage-per-
formers of the masculine gender. Which,
after all, is nothing to her discredit. Bless
her for it!
Off the boards, let me say, there is little
of the villain about me. I am a well-
groomed, clean-looking individual, who
might easily pass for the jeune premier. Pos-
sessed of a most ingratiating manner, out
of work or in, my breeziness and care-free
air infect everybody with whom I come in
contact. In fact, some of my jealous col-
leagues say that I am a better actor off the
stage than on it.
What wonder then that when I called
on the susceptible Airs. Chilwinkle in my
quest for apartments that lady was dazzled!
A star of the boards —more or less—l, on
my first entrance, became the star boarder
of her establishment.
Despite the ill-concealed envy of a certain
section of the widow’s guests. I had no diffi-
culty in sustaining the role for many work-
less weeks. Then rumor and society-
scribblers began to get.busy. So
the professional “heavy” decided
to play the jeune premier in
earnest. The part was offered me
and I accepted it.
On a certain Sunday night, on
the verandah in the gloaming, I
(still _ “disengaged,” with boots
beginning to show signs of the long
vacation) had a serious, heart-to-
heart talk with Airs. Chilwinkle.
In point of fact, I asked her to
marry me.
I had imagined the lady would jump at
me on the instant. But she didn’t. Instead,
there was a distinct Macready pause in the
proceedings. Could it have been faulty
stage-management on my part? I gazed
inquiringly at her averted face (in the half-
light it loomed up like a futurist concep-
tion of South Head) and was surprised at
its sudden seriousness.
After what seemed to be ages the widow
surprised me still more by turning to me
and asking in a soulful voice. “Are you quite
sure you love me for myself alone?”
For once I was slow in taking up my cue.
“Before you definitely make up " your
mind.” she continued, “it is only right "you
should know a little of my past life.”
This was more—much more—than I had
bargained for. A boardinghouse-keeper’s
past! Nonplussed. I waited for her horrible
revelations.
“Do you remember,” the soulful voice
proceeded, “a case in the papers of a year
and a half ago known as the Glebe Sensa-
tion ?”
“All I remember of a year and a half ago,”
I replied with pardonable pride, “is the sen-
sation I myself caused bv my performance
of Count Vermicelli in ‘Blood for Blood’ at
the Kamptulicon. A riot! Fifteen cur-
tains nightly ur

to it now.

Though the expres-
sion of her eyes was
exactly suited by the
name at the moment
the name itself had
no significance for me.
I was dumb, “gra-
velled for lack of
matter, ' as my be-
loved Shakspeare puts
it.
“T h e same Mr s.
Gimlet,” she resumed,
“who kept the house
where the star-boarder
was found one July
morning asphyxiated
in bis bed.”
T li e atmosphere
just hereabouts seemed
to become exceedingly
oppressive.
“As the reporters
truthfully said at the
time, Mr. Guggle was
discovered in his room
with every aperture of
door apd window
and chimney, even the keyhole, stopped up;
the gas full on. though not alight—quite
dead. A case of suicide the papers and the
coroner decided. I know better. It was
murder !”
By this time the reciter had fairly cap-
tured her audience. She saw it, and in a
tense whisper proceeded :
“You and I, Mr. Trimmings, will be the
only people in this world to share the secret.
Guggle, so he said, was on the stage, though
what he did there I never knew. When
he first came to my house he was out of an
engagement—just as you might be. Ilis
salary was too high, I understood, for most
managements to pay. I took pity on him.
Fool that I was! I gave him the best room
—the best of everything—at the cheapest
rate. And how did he repay me? By never
paying me at all! Then he began to play
the boss. He even ordered me about, and
turned the. other boarders into anarchists:
actually told them they weren’t getting
their money's \vorth, and if they didn’t see
what they wanted in the way of food they
were to demand it as their right. Ruin
stared me in the face. Although Guggle
owed me three months’ board-money‘ and I’d
lent him £7 ss. 3d. in hard cash, I gave
him notice to quit. But the man wouldn t
go. He defied me to turn him out. He
lorded it at the head of my table at meal-
times, and_ spouted like a Domain orator in
the drawing-room afterwards. Then —and
this was the last straw —he took to coming
in at all hours the worse for liquor and abus-
ing me. It was time something was done —
and I did it.”
“You did it!” I gasped. “Did what?"
“It was cold weather. Guggle had caught
a chill. He swore it was through the
draughts in the house. The draughts he got
outside, more likely! He used to go to bed
and fall off asleep, leaving the gas burning in
his room till the morning. His troubles about
gas bills !
“Well, one night, after he had been more
abusive than ever, I waited up for him, and
when I was sure that he was asleep I just
turned the gas off at the meter and then
turned it on again.”
I am used to melodrama, but I don’t mind
saying that this one had an uncanny effect
on me. Shivering, though perspiring freely,
I waited for the denouement.
“Guggle didn’t appear at breakfast. I
guessed he wouldn’t. We had a quiet, peace-
able meal for once. He wasn’t down to
lunch either. When the housemaid reported
that she had knocked and knocked at his
door and could get no answer I thought it
advisable to send for a locksmith. The door
was broken open and Guggle—but you know
the rest.
“You ask me to marry you, dear Mr. Trim-
mings. If, knowing my secret, you care to
take me for better or worse, as they say, I
am yours.”
I put on my hat. and. murmuring some-
thing about taking first of all a little walk

to think tilings over, I left her. I never
went back.

It was only yesterday that I met Guggle.
He is supering in our new blood-and-thunder
attraction at the Panjandrum—one of the
policemen who run me in in the last act. He
had heard I had been staying at Mrs. Chil-
winkle’s, and asked me how I liked it. I
in my turn asked him how it was that he
was still alive. Then I told him the land-
lady’s story, omitting, naturally, the intro-
ductory, or offer-of-marriage, portion. When
I had finished he broke out into a fit of laugh-
ter. “The old girl always invents some
horrible murder story to frighten off those
who don’t pay,” said he.
Then he winked as the knowing ones onlj
can wink, and asked me to buy him a beer.

Financing McHaggis.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 NEVER was keen on animal pets; the
only dog I ever had was acquired by
accident, and McHaggis, whom I kept
for one calendar week, imposed himself on
me in the same way. In a manner of speak-
ing, he wagged his Caledonian tail at my
door, and, without exactly intending to do
so, I took him in and fed him. He was not
the sort of man I would have gone in
search of. As a matter of cold fact, I have
neither the time nor the money to maintain
and amuse feckless persons of good family.
Still, I enjoyed McHaggis in a mild way
while he was with me; though when he had
gone I realised that he had been an expen-
sive interruption and —but perhaps it would
be better to get down to details.
McHaggis first got into touch with me by
writing to know where he could obtain some
of my -published “works.” Now, I have no
“works,” and when I informed him to that
effect by letter he wrote back telling me
how he had enjoyed something or other and
that he would like to shake me by the hand
So great was his enthusiasm that he un-
folded to me some of his family history and
gave me a brief sketch of his career, which
had been somewhat military. I was embar-
rassed by his confidences, especially when
he told me with tears in his ink how he had
left the Old Country and the First Hebrew
Dragoon Guards because he couldn’t get on
with his wife, who, he inferred, was a cold,
hard woman. It struck me then that McHa»-
gis must be a somewhat foolish person to
thiust such information at a comparative
stranger. I was absorbed then as now in
the gi and old sport of earning enough monev
to pay the bills, and
McHaggis was no more
to me than a remote,
shadowy letter-writer;
but I eased off long
enough to think around
McHaggis and mentally
size him up. There are
all sorts of letter-writers,
but an ex-Dragoon who
writes disparagingly of
his wife to someone he
has never met seemed
over the odds. I decided
that McHaggis must be
drinking too much in a
far land where there was
practically no demand for
Hebrew Dragoons o r
their professional ser-
vices ; either that or he
was a painfully emotional
type. As I was far too
busy to write any but
necessary letters. I
decided to gently drop
the over-confidential
McHaggis, and drop him
I did. But McHaggis
didn’t drop me. Every
now and then letters
about nothing would arrive and remind me
that he was still living and drinking to ex-
cess. There were occasional references to
his unfortunate domestic troubles; but he
gave me to understand that he was facing
them like a man and a Hebrew Dragoon. I
began to wonder whether I was his only pri-
vileged correspondent, or if he regularly cir-
cularised the world in reference to his
private affairs. Once or twice I was on
the point of writing and begging him to stop.
But I never did. His foolish letters had
infected me with some of his own sentimen-
tality, and I told myself that it would do
no good. So the stupid and unnecessary
correspondence dragged on till at last the
letter arrived which advised me that McHag-
gis was going back to his dragooning, but
that he had determined to pay me a visit
and shake me by the hands before he left,
because the odds were that, as his lot were
in Mesopotamia or thereabouts, he would
never come back. McHaggis never missed
a chance of being heavily pathetic.
So McHaggis, whom I wouldn’t have
known from a crow in the feather, duly
arrived and, metaphorically speaking, cast
himself on my bosom. Through me he also
cast himself on the bosom of a reliable land-
lady. He admitted, as man to man, that
he had put himself entirely into my hands ;
and before a week had sped I realised that
he had spoken no more than the truth. He
was a large, fat person who looked what he
really was—an actor. He could sing a little
and play a little and talk a great deal; he
also told me that he could act well, and I
am now quite sure that he could. In fact,
he could do practically everything but amuse
himself and stand on his own feet.
I did not realise liow much I had in-
herited McHaggis until, after providing him
with a complete Sunday’s supply of drink
and entertainment, I endeavored to do a
fair Monday-to-Saturday whack of work at
the office. When McHaggis had got tired
of peering helplessly around my door
and sending in messages by the bewildered
office-boy, who had never before met any-
thing quite like him, he took to ringing up
and asking me when I would be able to
see him at Swiller’s hotel. Lunch he
regarded as a sort of fixed feast. He wanted
to meet “all the boys,” and I endeavored to
oblige him by rounding up all the available
boys and feeding him in the midst of them.
Sometimes I paid for the boys’ lunches and
his, and sometimes they paid for his and
mine; but he always seemed to be absorbed
in a story when the bunch of checks was
being awarded. He was a lonely soul who
loved other people’s hospitality and didn’t
care how much of their working time lie
wasted. Before he parted with his hosts, he
made a point of inquiring when the next
refreshments were due. In that at least he
was thoroughly methodical, and I can say
from experience that he was never a second
late for a food or drink appointment. Still
he was a genial soul who had travelled a
great deal, and he talked well. Looking
back on my experience of him, I think that
he kept going by launching himself at
strangers, giving them to understand that
he must see more of them, and then, when
the welcome was wearing thin, appealing to
them for a loan to tide him over until the
expected remittance from Home arrived.
Seen in perspective from the rear, McHaggis
looks the sort of parasite that anyone might
have avoided. But he had a different aspect
from the front.
It was somewhere about the fourth day
that I began to tire of Mellaggis. llis dog-
like faithfulness was touching, but his total
inability to amuse himself was getting on
my nerves. I had plenty of work to do, but
I couldn’t settle down to it with McHaggis
haunting me day and night. Yet he was
a stranger in a strange land, and, having
acquired him, I felt bound to see that he
had as good a time as possible. So I fed
him and drank him, and my friends did like-
wise, and if they ever noticed liis shyness in
dispensing return hospitality they never
mentioned it. Sometimes I mentioned
to McHaggis that such and such a
trip was worth taking, but he never took
it if it was likely to keep him out of the
next food and drink reunion. Between whiles
he told me that he was getting along nicely
at the boarding-house to which I had r< om-
mended him; he passed over its few faults
like an old campaigner, and told me how he
was gradually getting the amiable landladv
and her minions into his ways. He assured
me that really he was “quite comfy.” I
felt glad of that afterwards when I had to
settle his bill.
He opened his campaign in real earnest
by letter at the beginning of our second and
last week of association. Something had
gone wrong—he hadn’t got something he had
expected—and he found he was short of the
HER IDEA OF HIM.

amount necessary to cable his trustees in
Scotland. He hated to trouble me, but
could, I oblige him with a couple of pounds?
It was a bit of a struggle, but I got the
money and shamefacedly pressed it into his
large, receptive palm when we met by
appointment at the head of a dark staircase.
(It is one of the painful mysteries of money-
lending that the unfortunate lender is in-
valuably made unhappy by his benevolence.
Perhaps it is because he knows that he is
making a fool of himself.) McHaggis gave
me a glance of understanding as if to say
that he would not reveal my shameful weak-
ness. Then I took him out to feed for the
ninth consecutive time, and, as usual, he did
full justice to the good things provided and
was not looking that way when the checks
were made out.
Of course the trustees in distant Scotland
didn’t cash up. Every time we met during
the next two or three days he was either
going to or coming from the bank to which
his correspondence was addressed. He spoke
bitterly of his trustees, and implied that
there would be trouble when next he saw
them. Meanwhile he clung closer to me
than any brother would have dared to do,
and told me splendid stories of his expei’i-
ences when serving with the First Hebrew
Dragoons. I think it is quite possible that
some of the experiences were his own. The
ordinary solvent life is a drab affair com-
pared with the bright and racy existence of
a Hebrew Dragoon, and I found him very
entertaining. And so did my friends. They
encouraged me to bring him along to the
feeding and drinking-place, and the days
were one long whirl of festivity. I
enjoyed it fairly well until the dreary fact
dawned on me that it was my financial
funeral.
When a troubled note to the effect that
he was reduced to Is. lOd. reached me, I told
myself that it was my duty to see McHaggis
through. I might have steeled myself but
for the fact that I had got him installed in a
boarding-house and felt morally bound to
shield him from humiliation and the land-
lady. from financial loss. He made some
passing reference to his accursed trustees
and mentioned a minimum of £3 Could I
let him have £3? I wrote back that I
couldn t let him have £3. This must have
depiessed him, for when a friend and I went
to collect him for the mid-day feast, we
found that he had taken definitely to drink.
However, the man he was drinking with
when we arrived was, so lie said, an official
of the bank who had just given him the
information that the expected cable was
awaiting him, I felt somewhat relieved. It
seemed to me that the dead weight of
McHaggis was about to he lifted from m.v
shoulders.
If anything, the tall whisky and soda
which he demanded with his lunch further
depressed him. llis conversation wobbled
and he showed a disposition to lay his head
on his grilled steak and go to sleep. But
he kept awake sufficiently to assure me and
my friend that our friendship was the one
thing that made his life worth living. We
did our united best to change the subject,
and were as cheerful as possible considering
the circumstances. Given a little encourage-
ment, he would have cried over the smoking
steak and put- it out. We managed to keep
him from breaking down and got him safely
out of the restaurant in something under
an hour—which was good going for a man
who didn’t seem to be able to feed in any-
thing under two. When we shook hands
with him at the corner of the street, I
pointed him in the direction of the bank and
said, “Well, I suppose you want to go up
and see about your cable, now?”
He looked at me with a boiled eve. “117m’
cable?”
‘‘You know ; the draft!”
He hiccuped miserably. “Wha’ draft?”
His look of sorrowful and sodden amaze-
ment made me feel uneasy, but I put it
down to the whisky-and-soda dream in which
he was moving, and once more set him
straight for the bank. “Good-bye!” we
duetted.
"Y\ ha’ draft?” he moaned, blinking after
us.
We waved our hands in cheerful farewell
and fled.
The long afternoon passed without inci-
dent; but on towards 5 o’clock (it was the
eve of McHaggis’s departure for Europe) a
small office-bqy delivered a message that
had been telephoned to the office by McHag-
gis's domestic A.D.C. (It was one of his
peculiarities that he would never use the
telephone personally.) I was to wait upon
McHaggis in his boarding-house that even-
ing. Then I had the bother of telephoning
to the boarding-house that I couldn’t pos-
sibly do so, but would be glad to see Mcllag-
gis at my own home if he cared to come up.
By the time that business was over, it was
time to go home and I did so. My wife
met me at the door. McHaggis had tele-
phoned home ahead of me repeating his
royal command for me to wait upon him. I
threw down my bag of papers in the hall
and spent a long twenty minutes at the
house telephone conversing with McHaggis
through a chain of suburban exchanges, the
domestic A.D.C. and the amiable landlady,
who, God knows why, thanked me for send-
ing McHaggis to the establishment. I pic-
tured the lordly and incoherent McHaggis
in his room and the panting, servile A.D.C.
running between the bedside and the ’phone,
and became so tired of it all that, when the
line was interrupted somewhere, I made no
attempt to reconnect, but hung up the
receiver with a crash. “Now,” I thought,
“now he will drag himself together and get
on with his packing. I’m safe for this even-
ing, anyhow.”
Mrs. Lazarus went out to dinner with a
woman-friend, and I had a lonely, thoughtful
meal, after which I sat down and tried to
collect_ my wandering thoughts preparatory
to beginning work. Nine o’clock came and
went and I was just settling down when
there was a ring at the door. My heart
sank and I padded softly to let in the inter-
minable McHaggis. But it wasn’t he. In-
stead of the familiar countenance high in
the air I saw a strange perspiring face
under an old hat and over a pyramid of
greasy clothes.
“ ’Scuse me, sir,” mumbled the stranger,
dragging off his hat, “are you Mister
Lazarus?”
“Yes.”
“Note fer you, sir,” he announced and
thrust a filthy envelope at me.
When I examined it under the hall-lamp
I saw that it was covered with strange pen-
cil-tracings. “Who is this from?” I asked,
knowing all the time that it could only be
from the one and inescapable.
_ “It’s from Major McLlaggis, sir! He
give it to me in th’ bar of th’ Bonzer Hotel.
The barman got me ter bring it up, sir.
I’m th’ bloke that sells peanuts jus’ opp’-
site.” Here he took off his hat and twiddled
it helplessly.
I tore open the envelope. In it was a
telegram which McHaggis had already
showed me eighteen times. It was in refer-
ence to his cabin on the ship, and contained
no reference whatever to money. The other
enclosure was a scrap of writing-paper cov-
ered with disjointed sentences and tracings
of lightning flashes. It was almost unintel-
ligible, but there seemed to be a vague refer-
ence to £3 or £5, and that the bearer was
quite trustworthy.
“Er —how was the Major when you left
him?” I queried.
The, expectant peanut man licked his dry
lips and lied brightly: “Oh, ’e was orright,
sir—quite orright!”
I thought it a fair thing to doubt the pea-
nut man. “I don’t know what he wants, but
I’ll write a note to him. Come inside for a
minute. Will you have a drink?”
The peanut man licked his
lips and looked at the whisky
bottle. But he wanted to im-
press me, so he asked for “jus’
a drink o’ worter, if yer don’t
mind, sir.” I didn’t, and he
duly received and drank the
plain water while I scribbled
a brief note to McHaggis that I had no
money in the house but would be at the
office at 9 o’clock next morning.
“Did the Major pay you for coming up
here ?”
The peanut man looked nervous. “Well,
sir, ’e did say that you’d fix that up with,
me!” I gave the peanut man the sealed
reply and half-a-crown for bothering me.
Then I dismissed him and went back to my
work—and found I was far too tired to do
it.
About ten o’clock, as I was falling asleep
over a book, there was a faint, half-hearted
tinkling of the telephone bell. It suggested
to me a drowning McHaggis ringing feebly
for help at the bottom of a sea of whisky-
and-soda. I didn’t answer it. That night
I dreamt of a purple-faced McHaggis swim-
ming desperately in an effervescing son nrd
shrieking for me to help him because he had
enjoyed my “works,”
I was on time at the office next morning •
nit, early as I was, the emissary of
McHaggis had been before me. Before 1
had taken off my coat, he was there again
With tne inevitable despatch. It was a sober
one this tune, and in it McHaggis asked me
himly and definitely for £3 “to pay the en-
closed bill and enable me to get away from
th,., place.” (He s „„ k( , „b..ut "this pla«" a“
it it were a sort of robber’s cave.) The hill
was for something under £2. There was an
ominous addition to the effect that I was to
be at the steamer with “the other £2 von
promised me yesterday.” I then remembered
that, on the previous day, I had offered to
introduce him to a friendly bank manager
and ask his professional advice and assist-
anoe m connection with Mcllaggis’s long-
! « n •' l< ' ll . l 'gg' s starting back
‘ 1 1 ~ 1 ° ffere(l to introduce him to a
death-adder, I had rashly murmured some-
thing about fixing him up myself to the extent
ot a fiver. _ This had stuck in his besotted
memory and the brute was holding me to it
I here was nothing to be done. I enclosed
three £1 notes in an envelope, wrote a few
pathetic remarks which probably excited his
hearty contempt, and gave the package to the
ambassador. I did not trouble myself about,
his draft on Scotland, or his lOU. The one
idea I had left in my head was: “How can I
get, out of giving him this last £2/ Surely to
Heaven I have sufficient strength of mind to
refuse him? Once lie is aboard the lugger
1 have done with him.”
But it was not to he.
I had introduced McHaggis into my small
circle, and the circle knew him only as a
social success who occasionally drank too
much—quite a venial offence. Mrs. Lazarus
and a woman friend who had enj'oyed his
music had promised to coine down to the
ship and see him off, and as I had the job of
escorting them I was bound to face him
once more. Before I went down to meet
them I did up two more £1 notes in an en-
velope and addressed it to the relentless
McHaggis. I could have made things un-
pleasant for him by informing the ladies; but
that wouldn’t have been sportsmanlike.
Besides, I would have got a horrible time
myself.
I duly met the ladies and we all proceeded
to the steamer, where we discovered that,
owing to the war, no visitors were allowed
on board. So we waited standing on the
wharf for the McHaggis and I fingered the
envelope and wondered whether it really mat-
tered. Was it worth while spoiling the
McHaggis temper for the last £2 worth of
tar? If I carried out my rash promise to
the letter, wasn’t there a chance (a very re-
mote chance, but still a chance) of' the
McHaggis eventually coming to light witb the
money? Of course, his wild start of horror
at the mention of a real bank manager and
real negotiations was a pretty good indica-
tion to anybody but a born lunatic that there
never had been a draft or any real expecta-
tion of one. Still, I was full of hope.
He eventually arrived in a cab —a cab that
had been paid for with my money. He was
looking for me so hard that I had to pursue
him through the crowd and grasp him by
the arm before he noticed me. Then I led
him to the ladieS and a few mild jokes of
the usual inane sort were exchanged. Dur-
ing a lull in the very brief conversation, I
slid the final donation into his hand, miser-
ably and mysteriously muttering as I did so,
“Oh, McHaggis, here’s that note!” He
glanced at it casually and thrust it into
the side-pocket of his coat. He didn’t
trouble to say anything about drafts or notes-
of-hand; the time had gone by for trivial
patter.
Having got all he really wanted, he held
out his hand to Mrs. Lazarus and remarked.
“I'm sorry I can’t show you the cabin.
Good-bye!”
“Good-bye!” she echoed cheerfully. “Best
of luck and a safe return!”
He was not particularly affected.
“Good-bye!” chirped Mrs. Lazarus’s friend,
offering her hand. He took it as he took
everything.
It was up to me. Seizing the strong right
hand that had relieved me of so much, I
agitated it in the usual manner. “Good-bye,

“’ Struth!”
old man! Good luck!” He nodded sadly-
I think it hurt him to part from me. I was
easy and he was going back to a land creep-
ping with busted persons of noble blooa,
where he was known, and where his pathetic
Babe in the Wood act would probably be
received with cold derision. He never looKe
back as he went up the gangway to the still
that was to carry him away to seek som
body else’s fortune. .
He was a dear fellow- —one of the deares
I ever met. I hated to part with him, bu .
if he had stayed with me a week or tw
longer. I would have been forced to sell m
to pay expenses.

In Mid Path.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This is the story of Mau, the boat-builder,
totd to me on the beach at Tahiti, where an
overgrown path runs from the crumbling
rums of a native house towards another
that is rotting in the earth, amid a wilder-
ness of lantana and cocoa-palms and bananas
and mummy-apples that no man will enter,
even in the seasons when the breadfruit fails.
LONG ago Moano lived in this house
hard by where we sit. In the other
one up the path dwelt Tehue. When
all her people had died in a great sickness
she lived alone till Moano took her to wife.
Ihe man then was a good fellow, though
a little dull and heavy-seeming to such a
girl, who was light as the air that played
about her home, • and over fond of feast-
ing and dancing, as .the voung are apt to be.
One day a gay, roystering chief came over
on a visit from Moorea, bringing with him
in his capoe n party pf young bloods and
their Great was the slaughter of
pigs; palm toddy and beer of orange juice
fermented with wild honey flowed in streams;
flower-wreathed men and girls danced on
the beach and sang among the trees. When
that canoe set out for Moorea again it crept
from the lagoon at night; and in it was
Tehue, who thought a fine fellow who voy-
aged with such a retinue more than fair
exchange for Moano, who, though wise, yet
seemed foolish to her.
Tehue’s dream ,of feasts, dances and
canoeing over sunny seas was short, and
soon another vahine dreamed .the dream in
her place. Cast aside, her heart yearned
homeward: Moano and the old quiet days
and ways seemed of a sudden very safe and
desirable. So she stole from Moorea and
came to me one night to learn how things
went in her old home.
Aftei finding that Moano had taken no
other woman, she preened herself like a
bird.
‘•Tell me true —am I fair, Mau?”
“ You were always fair, Tenue; too fair
perhaps.”
“I am fair enough to go to Moano and
say It is finished —I have come home iu
stay by you’?”
lhat I cannot tell you. He has been
quieter than ever since you went away—
almost like a paliua on a ryck. But, in such
a iiVr 11 sadness does not loosen the tongue.”
lie was always so. And if he be sad
then he loves me. So will I be the fisher to
pry the dull paliua from his rock ; and my
beauty shall serve me as spear, if hi s love
does not.”
mi Mayha f } * But Moano’s eyes are not dull.
I hey see further than the eyes of most —
looking beyond beauty such as yours.”
“Are your eyes that keen, ' Mau, the
builder of boats?”
So she taunted, tempting me. Her voice
sank low; it was slumbrous, like the croon-
mg of the reef on a hot moontide when the
wind sleeps. Parting one black tress from
her mass of hair she swept it lightly across
my cheek, stooping above me with eyes that
might draw a man on, and on, as unknown
lulls and seas draw him. I put her hair
away: it was a net in which I had no mind
to be caught. It may be I was not so firm
within; for I, who am old, was young then,
and in my days I have never seen woman
lovelier than Tehue.
“Ay, my eyes are that keen,” I told her.
But she only laughed lightly, crying as"
she whisked away and was gone:’ “Then
neither you nor Moano are men, but 'only
pahuas, after all. stuck to your rocks by
either fear or sloth.”
I went to see Moano next day. He
was of a deep, serious nature unusual
among my people, who take life as a
toy to be tossed from hand to hand. I
knew that he had felt the thing she had
done more keenly than most of our men, who
are not so strict in such matters as you
who are white —though perhaps we are
more honest also. We ate- together, and not
till we lay smoking after the meal was
done did he mention the affair. Then he
spoke.
“Tehue came to me last night. She
thought she could take up the line just
where she dropped it. She thinks so’ no
more.”
The sound of the land-crabs shuffling among
the remains of the meal was all" the reply
he got. Suddenly he sat upright. I saw
in his eyes something of that which I knew
lay beneath his quiet way: it was not good
to see. And then lie bit the words like
pebbles between his teeth.
“She wept, of course. What are the tears
of such a woman? The light shower that
follows drouth, undoing naught of the sun’s
scathe, but only promising a boon which
comes not! Forgiveness without forgetful-
ness is like a canoe without a paddle, and
which of us may slay memory? And yet
I cannot forgive what she is.”
I remembered what I had told Tehue
about the keenness of his eyes.
“She is sad now, and therefore thinks
she is sorry,” he cried. “That would soon
pass: then she would thirst after her follies
again. Once more I should be ‘Moano the
dullard,’ “Moano the stone,’ ‘Moano the
heavy-foot.’ So with one light o’ love after
another she would make mock of the dul-
lard, the stone, the heavy one, as once she
has done already. What would you have
done in my place? As for me, I have rooted
out that weed.”
Strong-minded as he was, clearly as he
THE SPOILS OF VICTORY.
“Bit big, aren't they?"
"Well, dearest, you told me to beat the profiteer every time, and I got you the largest
size I could for the price."
had seen the truth, he still wanted to be
told he had done wisely. But, though
young, I had learned not to give counsel
So I said :
“The lizard who. has lost his tail must
needs wait till lie lias grown him a new
one. lie cannot fit the tail of another, to
his need.”
( lie smiled bitterly, then told me sadly:
“Young you may be, Mau, yet you are wiser
than I. And you never took a woman into
your house to rob you of rest and till your
belly with bitterness.”
“No,” I answered him ; “nor one to bring
me the peace which is better than rest and
to empty the heart of the trouble which is
worse than hunger.”
And, leaving him to make what he would
of that saying, I went back to my logs.
Teliue returned to her old house. She
had to take the path by Moano’s to get to
the beach ; and she hoped thus to win him
back. Surely when he saw her pass daily in
her fresh young beauty he would desire her
again! Surely his own loneliness would
become hateful were she there to remind
him of it!
She told me once she loved the man. Per-
haps she did—in her fashion. Or perhaps she
grew hotter as he grew colder, as women
will. But it was all wasted®on Moano, who
had indeed, as he had said, rooted out that
weed. Then she threw away her last chance
in her pique, though it is in my mind that
it was no chance at all.
She flaunted many lovers in Moano’s face.
And his smile took on a little more scorn
than before: that was all. Her house rang
with feasting, dancing, singing. Young men
and girls, flower-wreathed, streamed by
Moano’s; hours later they reeled back, the
crushed chaplets awry on their foolish faces,
flihging taunts at the silent man as they
passed. Sometimes Teliue would come that
far down with them, and shout half-tipsy
abuse at him. But the hill recks not of
the crabs that scratch at its base; though
on a day it may fall and crush them.
I went away for some years on the
schooners then. When I came back Moano
was still living in one house, Tehue in the
other. But no longer was it she who had
come home from Moorea to turn men’s blood
to fire and their wills to water. The youth
and beauty of our women fades fast: it
fades quickest of all when squandered to
the winds of wantonness as Tehue had
squandered hers. She looked almost like
some of the withered hags I had seen in
the gloomy western islands. I thought: “Ay,
if the nut be unsound it is but poor busi-
ness to mark the fineness of the husk.” Also,
there was such fear in her eyes as clutched
even at my heart to see. The horror
widened her eyes as she told me her tale.
“Moano has sworn to see all my beauty
lade And it is fading fast enough ! Look
here! And here! And here!” She beat
her face, her breast, her limbs, as she spoke
in her frenzy. “Is this the Tehue you knew?
Already I am old —I who am younger than
the wife of Tapu Tani, though none would
think it. Men turn from me now for the
younger vahhvcs. From me whom they all
loved! And never woman, young or old,
could hold her man against me if I but
smiled oncp on him.”
As I watched her agony and heard her piti-
ful boasts I was glad I had no daughter.
Then her voice shrilled to a scream.
“Ay, and worse than that! He swears to
sit and watch me wither till I am sapless as
a dead twig. He sits by the end of the path
and fleers at me as I pass. His eyes search
me to see if I am a little thinner to-day.
And there is a smile on his lips more terrible
than words. And so it will go on, as it has
gone on, month after month, year after year,
till.. .. I cannot go away; for where among
strangers may a woman with her youth and
loveliness behind her find a place to sit?
And shall he drive me from my home, too?”
.She looked quickly behind her then, as one
who fears to find a dread presence at her
elbow.
“I cannot even die,” she croaked at me.
“I will tell you why, Mau, the builder of
boats: it is because lie has sworn to live and
see me die first! And I think his hate is
stronger than the power of death itself!
Ohe ! Ohe ! Ohe !”
My blood ran cold. So Moano would be
revenged for all Tehue’s past offences: for
the later flauntings and tauntings of her piti-
ful pique, as for the first fault of her hot
young blood.
She rose to go. But before she left she
turned to cry at me:
“Tell Moano the dullard that I will see
him die first! Tell him that I will choke
the death-rattle back in my throat till I
hear that his eyes have closed on the sun.
Tell him I will cheat him at the last as at
the beginning. Me die first, and leave that
clod to spit on my grave! I hate him too
much! They who are fools say you can live
on love. I tell you that I” —and she tore
at her breasts till the blood came—“will live
on hate!”
I found Moano changed, too; yet not so
much as the woman. But he drooped, he who
had always been so upright. His body, too,
had lost its lustre, and his silence had become
sullenness. He seemed glad to see me, but
after our first greetings and talk his eyes
turned to the path; I doubt not his mind
followed his eyes, and not the ears which
he pretended to lend to my' tales.
So the thing went on between these two,
each having sworn to see the other die first;
soon, indeed, that was all they had left to live
for. People fell away from them, looking
askance at them. I think both became a
little mad, as well they might.
“He no longer seems waiting for me to die,”
the woman told me one day, for by now I
was the only one who had aught at all to
do with either of them. “He is killing me
with his eyes! Even when I sit in my
house I know he waits by the end of the
path ; waits to see them carry me out of my
house for the last time. But I will not die'
I tcill not!”
So might the fish cry when the hook has
struck into him and the line is drawing him
slowly out of water!
At nights she could see the light burning
in his house on the path below her.
None could help them; tin; thing seemed
beyond all mortal power. They did as they
were fated to do. For consider this. The
cocoanut carries within itself the seed of
death as well as of life. It is all there in
the nut before ever a shoot pierces the husk:
the tender tree; the young palm that ruffles
it bravely but fruits not as yet; the mature
tree, whose swinging crest seems to scrape the
very sky; the crash when it falls at last.
That tree, too, is strong and hale, or weakly
and deformed, not as it wills, but as the
chances of soil and weather and such power
as is within itself ordain. And it dies at
last with no more choice of its death than
it had of its birth.
The man began to fail as time sped; the
sap dried up in his body. For all his brave
bearing and words, I think he feared she
might cheat him, after all, as she had said
she would; especially after a fever had laid
a heavy hand on him. Even then he had his
mat set so that he could see the path.
Ihe woman fell sick, too —a great sickness
ran through the land. I tended them both
as well as I could, since no one else would
go near. I could almost see the sun through
him. The matter drew to some end at last.
“It is well; I could not have held out
much longer,” Moano said when I told him
lehue was sick. “I miss her, though, Man.
All these years I have done little save watch
her go and come; and now the path knows
her'no more.” I wondered if he had grown
to love his hate; for the strands of love and
hate at times seem plaited close as the
strands of a rope. And at least his words
seemed to show that he missed something out
of his life. “She walks not?” he would ask
every morning as I entered. And when I
:eft: “She has not passed to-day!”
She was sinking like the sun in the west
when day dies. Soon she would be gone, like
the sun, beyond the rim of our world. But,
unlike the sun, she would not come again.
And her cry was: “Is he still alive?” I was
sure that were either of them told at noon
the other died, then that one, too, would
pass ere dark.
One morning I did not find him on his mat,
nor anywhere in the house. I hastened up
the path, fearing I know not what; though
most of all, I think, that, feeling the end
near, he had set out to kill her first, and so
keep his oath, the swearing of which had
fouled his life, as filth in a spring may foul
a stream throughout its length from hillside
to salt water.
Just half-way between the houses I found
them both dead. There they had met —each

backs, and then there's nothing to show

crawling along a foot at a time as their
tracks showed. Iler arms were stretched out
towards him, his towards her, as though their
hands had worked after the last flicker of
strength had gone from their bodies. But life
had left them before ever their hands touched.
And so they lay, each reaching for the other;
and death the barrier between, which they
might not pass.

The Unusual regard
in which the average
Hupmobile owner holds
his car is, of course, the
reflection of unusual
qualities in the car itself.
One owner might tell
you the car is remarkably
economical of petrol and
tyres. Another, that it
stays out of the repair
shop. A third, that its
performance is really
wonderful.
But if they all were to
sum up the reasons why
they like the Hupmobile
so well, they probably
would say because it is
exceptionally trust-
worthy.

HAIR BEAUTY
Without Tonics or Soap Washes.
GIRLS and women who wish to keep
their hair in nice condition should
===== be most cautious in the soap they
wash it with. Most soaps and ready-mixed shampoos
contain excessive quantities of alkali. This dries the
scalp, makes the hair brittle, and is very injurious. Just
ordinary colinated cocoanut oil (a pure, saponified, but
quite greaseless liquid) is far better than the most costly
soap you could possibly use for a shampoo, for this
cannot possibly hurt your hair.
Merely wet hair with water and rub it on. A
couple of teaspoonsful makes a perfect flood of rich,
thick creamy lather, and cleanses both hair and scalp
thoroughly. The lather rinses out easily, and takes
with it every trace of dust, dirt, dandruff or excessive
oiliness. The hair dries quickly and evenly, and comes
out fine and silky, bright, glossy and fluffy, appearing
to be heavier than it is. And, best of all, this colinated
cocoanut oil leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. You can get
colinated cocoanut oil at most any chemist’s, but be sure
it s colinated, which is not expensive—a few ounces
lasting a long, long time.
IMPORTANT.—Do not confuse Colinated Cocoanut
Oil with the cheap and sticky emulsified cocoanut oils,
or the raw cocoanut oils offered by
some chemists as substitutes. There
is only one Colinated Cocoanut Oil,
non-greasy, and it is compounded
only by the International Labora-
tories. Look for the maker’s name
on every bottle to secure satisfaction.
