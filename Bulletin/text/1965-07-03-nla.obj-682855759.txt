“To do business around the world I needed an
airline that flew everywhere. That’s why I tried
Pan Am. That’s why I’ve stuck with Pan Am.”
—says Mr. Harold Porter, Packaging Exporter, of Melbourne
“I do a lot of flying ’round the world
and every time I take a trip on Pan
Am I learn something new. My
most recent trip took me through
the U.S., Britain, Scandinavia, and
the Far East. 1 learned that Pan
Am flies straight through to Europe,
not just from New York, but from
major U.S. cities like Detroit, Chi-
cago, Seattle and San Francisco
17 cities in all. That kind of con-
venience is invaluable to a business-
man in a hurry.”
Businessmen fly Pan Am every-
where. With good reason. Pan Am
has a wealth of experience with the
needs of businessmen. And it puts
that experience to work. In arrang-
ing reservations, making quick con-
nections, planning itineraries, and in
seeing to it that in-flight service
covers a businessman’s every re-
quirement. That’s why Pan Am has
won a worldwide reputation among
businessmen. Why not find out for
yourself? All you have to do is call
your Pan Am Travel Agent. Or call
us. You’ll have a good feeling know-
ing you’ve chosen the very best.

What's all the shouting about...
MAGNETIC
LEDGER
CARD!!!
The fuss some people make, you’d think It
was new. Well it may be to some, but
magnetic ledger cards have been a proven
technique for years at NCR ~. and they're
now doing an excellent job for thousands
of satisfied customers.
NCR pioneered and installed the first mag*
netic ledger machines in 1957, and since
then has produced oyer 1,300 million mag*
netic ledger cards. The concept of magnetic
ledgers enables you to use electronic tech-
niques to speed up and simplify office work/
while retaining traditional hard-copy
records for immediate visual reference and'
action. You can read the figures printed
on the front of the card .. . NCR Account*
ing Machines and Computers automatically
read the data encoded and stored in mag-
netic memories on the back' of the card.
Magnetic ledgers mean the end of errors
in account selection and balance pick-up
. . . they mean neater records because the
machine controls form-alignment and
spacing . , . they speed up work by elimi-
nating time-wasting tasks which have to be
done manually on conventional machines.
For more information about NCR Magnetic
Ledgers call your local NCR office or write

National Notebook
The Two Cultures
r | ''he Australian opening of Les Ballets
Africains in Brisbane last week
turned out to be a fascinating clash of
tribal cultures. The Africans have a tradi-
tional fertility dance from the Bagatai
country of Guinea which the women
and girls perform naked from the waist
up. Anglo-Saxons since early missionary
days have performed the ancestral rite
of decently covering ladies in calico. The
two traditions met head on at Brisbane.
The programme was to open with the
Bagatai dance. This calls for the appear-
ance of the goddess of fertility, “Nimba
of the huge breasts.” She is hailed by the
women and girls with the song ... . “O
Nimba, thou who brings forth fruit from
the dust. Here are my breasts, may they
be as big as yours . . .” “Swan Lake” was
never like this.
Brisbane responded with the tradi-
tional Anglo-Saxon tribal reflex. The
Queensland Council of Churches wrote
to the Premier, Frank Nicklin, asking
that the girls be ordered to cover up. And
Brisbane’s “anti-smut” campaigner Mr
Alan Russell sent 65 telegrams of pro-
test to authorities throughout Australia.
In these circumstances David H. Mc-
Uwraith, the 42-year-old Melbourne
entrepreneur who brought the show to
Australia, announced that the girls would
dance covered up. The management an-
nounced later that only two seat book-
ings were cancelled as a result.
The dancers themselves seemed put
out. Eighteen-year-old Bah Sadio on her
arrival at the Brisbane airport looked in-
credulous. She started to say something,
checked herself, and then commented:
“Of course, if covering up is the custom
of Brisbane then we must not offend
the people here. But I do not know why
people in Brisbane do this. It will not
show our real dancing culture.” Mr Mc-
Ilwraith pointed out that this national
ballet ensemble of the Republic of
Guinea had appeared uncovered all over
the world, including before British
Royalty at an Edinburgh Festival Com-
mand Performance last year.
The covering up was effected with a
red halter top affair but like an elaborate
baby’s bib and prettied with white
beads. The girls didn’t allow the confine-
ment to interfere with their magnificent
energy and artistry. The audience roared
applause. What Nimba made of it all,
nobody knows.
When the show settled down for its
Brisbane run after the preliminary con-
troversy it proved to be a winner. The
audience clapped wildly and called the
dancers back for encore after encore, and
the dancers stepped out of character to
stand on the stage laughing and cheering
the audiences. The only pity was that the
chilly westerlies kept down the size of the
houses. It was Brisbane’s coldest spell this
year. Maybe the girls from Guinea were
glad of their halter tops after all.
Footnote: The dancers* went down to
Surfers’ Paradise for a day and liked the
scenery. They said they were a bit
shocked, though, at the sunbaking girls in
bikinis, lying around like that, uncovered
in public.
Home Improvement
you remember Barry Humphries’
lovely “Highett Waltz”?
The second verse went thus:
For I’m dying to try it in Highett
With the aid of those nice housing
schemes
Where the cream brick veneers
Stay hygienic for years
In Highett, the place of my dreams.
What would Humphries sing now?
The new dream in Moonee Ponds and
elsewhere is the imitation brick veneer,
which also stays hygienic for years. It
is a special board designed to cover
weatherboard houses and make them
look like brick. We phoned Mr K. J.
Cook of Visa Brick and he assured us
that Visa Brick was booming. He said
there were three major people in the field
Visa Brick, Bricklyke and Beauty
Home. The cost is between £350 and
£750.
“Visa Brick,” said he, “comes from
Canada and is made by Dominion Tar.
It has a backing of Caneite with an
eighth of an inch of asphalt, and on top
of that granules of trap rock which is,
in effect, brick. Anything that’s in brick
we copy. Yes, cream brick, liver brick
. . . We even have a board that looks
like the thin Besser blocks. I think it’s
terrific stuff. We can put it up in two
days.”
Perhaps Visa Brick’s greatest triumph
was the brick house in Melbourne’s
Prahran which had been covered with
Visa Brick. The brickwork was a very
messy job and Visa Brick made it look
much better, said Mr Cook.
F rontiermen
* I ''he announcement a few days ago of
-*■ an anonymous gift of £250,000 to
Australian Frontier is a tribute to the
persuasive powers of the Rev. Peter
Mathews of Canberra, especially as the
gift is believed to have all come from
the one source. Mr Mathews is the
director of Frontier.
The tribute is all the more warm as
Australian Frontier has been defined in
such vague and high-minded terms as
“designed to help solve moral and civic
pioblems in Australia”.
Australian Frontier was initiated by
the Australian Council of Churches, but
it is essentially Mr Mathews’ baby. He
is an Australian Congregational minister
who worked for six years in the Northern
Rhodesian copper belt where he set up
the sort of organisation he plans here.
The £250,000 will mean that a start
can be made on the organisation’s head-
quarters in Canberra, but Mr Mathews
is looking for another £500,000. The
Canberra headquarters will embrace a
college, which may seek a link with the
Australian National University so that
"I would go inside, but we need the tomatoes ."

degrees can be awarded. The college
will specifically provide post-graduate
theological courses.
The Canberra headquarters will also
provide courses for the laity and under-
take research, mainly in social studies.
Australian Frontier has already under-
taken several consultations (it is even
developing a language of its own) in
different cities. In Canberra there will
be a consultation on youth leadership,
a subject on which millions of words
were wasted in New South Wales a few
years ago.
In Brisbane, it invited a number of
people together to talk about “Responsi-
bility for Community Life in a New
Area”. In Adelaide they got together
to talk about “The Adelaide of To-
morrow the Planners and the Public”.
In Melbourne when Frontier invited a
group to discuss “Responsibility for
Community Living” they found that
members of Melbourne University’s
Town Planning Department, Social
Studies Department and Institute of
Applied Economic Research were meet-
ing for the first time. This, said a spokes-
man for the Australian Council of
Churches, did seem to show that the
people concerned with various aspects
of planning not only did not work in to-
gether but they did not even know each
other .
Australian Frontier was tied to the
churches, the spokesman added, only to
the extent that the churches thought this
sort of thing should be happening. “The
church does not have the answers to
many of today's problems, but often
tries to give the impression that it has,”
he said.
Involvement
“ r I ''he Theatre of Cruelty will use shock
tactics to involve the audience to
a greater degree than ever before,” ex-
plained Miss Julie Ewington, a member
of the team which will stage “The Revue
of Cruelty” at Sydney University’s Union
Theatre this week.
She went on to enumerate some of the
involvements: In “Our Times A
Catalogue of Nasty Disasters”, by turn-
of - the - century French writer Felix
Fenenon, an actor reads newspaper
items reporting freak tragedies such as
the mademoiselle who fell off a swing
and punctured herself with a pair of
scissors, and a vitriol murder attempt
which backfired on the assailant. The
gentleman in the title role of “The
Celestial Adventures of Mr Aspro” is
costumed as an aspro. Another player
emerges from a chamber pot in Alfred
Jarry’s “The Confessions of a Child of
the Century”.
“Extraordinary ‘happenings’ will occur
in the theatre foyer every night,” Miss
Ewington went on. “The usherettes will
be masked and wearing strange costumes.
A performance of cruelty appeals to all
the senses, prejudices and fears.”
Producer Albie has kept audiences
from settling back in their seats with a
number of absurd plays in the past. Out-
side of the Theatre of Cruelty he is an
amiable fellow who is employed by the
ABC as a trainee producer and who last
year managed the Elizabethan’s Lunch-
Time Theatre.
However, one feels, hardly a show for
the whole family. Miss Ewington had
a retort to that too: “Children love it,”
she said. “Three infants aged between
two and five sat in on rehearsals and
were enthralled by the grotesque spec-
tacles and masks. They are perhaps
better qualified than anyone to under-
stand the sound poems which are very
near to baby talk.” Sample from Kurt
Schwitters’ "Sonata”: “grim glim gnim
bimbim”.
Multi-deck
Oerth's new city planning officer, Paul
Ritter, swept into the WA capital
like a breath of fresh air last week,
complete with wife and six children.
One of the first things he said was a
blunt: “I don’t like flats—they’re a sub-
standard way to build.”
For a city that has flats projects spring-
ing up like mushrooms after the first
rains, this was disturbing—especially as
Mr Ritter, a 39-year-old Englishman,
is to be paid £4OOO a year for his advice.
He favors deck housing, already a
success in Sheffield and no more ex-
pensive to build than flats. This idea
is basically groups of dwellings, each
With direct access to high-level roadways
that are not for cars. These roadways
include children’s playgrounds and small
shops.
Any number of blocks of houses can
be connected in this way. People can
stroll along these pedestrian-ways and
thus eliminate the loneliness and remote-
ness of life in flats, says Mr Ritter. This
is particularly important for mothers
and old people and is much safer for
children.
The blocks range from three to 14
storeys with a “deck” every third floor.
Each vehicle road serving the blocks is
a cul-de-sac and main roads running
through the area are not near the blocks.
Another of Mr Ritter’s ideas which he
wants to encourage is to abolish the con-
ventional footpath and road outside the
front gate of an ordinary suburban
home. The system he favors employs a
set of minor footpaths leading to a
major one. Houses have a road and
garage at one end and a footpath at the
other. Mr Ritter is a master of civic
design, a bachelor of architecture and
a member of the Institute of Town Plan-
ning of Great Britain. Nevertheless,
Perth people, traditionally suspicious of
outsiders’ ideas (“outside” includes the
eastern States), are wary.
JOURNALISTS AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE
feuLLetCn
80 Years Ago: July 4, 1885
good deal of undignified Press
indignation has been exhibited
towards Lord Loftus, the new Gover-
nor of NSW. It appears that on the
evening of the day the Soudan Con-
tingent landed in Sydney, His Excel-
lency gave a dinner at Government
House to the officers of the Contin-
gent and the colonial representatives
who came to welcome them. The
Governor wished the speeches re-
ported by the Press. Why he did so is
the only singular thing in the whole
affair. We happen to know most of
the representatives, but if anyone can
show that a single person at the table
that night, from His Lordship to the
gentlemen who waited on him, ever
said or wrote a thing that had not
been said or written better by some-
one else, then the desire to have the
speeches preserved will appear
sensible enough. And this is why we
wonder at a man of His Excellency’s
penetration desiring to have them
reported. The reporters went. When
they left for Government House they
were jocose homicidal when they
returned. His Lordship had left
orders that while the racy badinage
appropriate to a good dinner was
going on, the newspaper people
should stay outside and content them-
selves with an occasional peep through
the keyhole. But when the cloth was
removed, and the real business of the
evening the speeches began, the
door was to be slightly ajar, so that
the Pressmen might miss nothing. If,
even with this concession, the words
were imperfectly heard, a flunkey
might be persuaded to open the door
a little wider. And it is against all
this that the dailies pretend to be
indignant! That is, they are indignant
with the creature of a system, but
not with the system itself, which
permits such creatures to be.

"My morals will be satisfied if we make them cover up in Brisbane and Melbourne, and then well go to
Sydney to see them in the raw."


PLAIN ENGLISH
Mr Wilsons Mission
Tt seems unfortunately certain that
the Commonwealth Prime Mini-
sters’ attempt to bring peace to Viet-
nam will fail. Hanoi, Peking and the
Vietcong have already scorned a
dozen such initiatives and have never
shown the faintest desire to negotiate.
They believe that the war is going
their way and that negotiations now
could only delay their victory. Official-
ly they pay lip-service to the idea of
peace by saying they are prepared to
negotiate but only after the US with-
draws all of its troops from South Viet-
nam; in other words, the only peace
they are interested in is the peace which
comes from conquest.
One must also dismiss the hope
that its decision to meet the Viet-
cong’s National Liberation Front will
make any difference. President John-
son has already, in effect, attempted
to negotiate with it: he offered to meet
representatives of Hanoi and would
clearly meet Front representatives as
members of Hanoi’s delegation. There
is no new avenue to be explored here.
The only real hope for peace in
South Vietnam is to convince Hanoi,
Peking and the Vietcong that they
will not conquer South Vietnam. This
requires not only a deep commitment
on our part but an awareness of what
we are up against, and in this context
the various negotiation proposals
except in very special circumstances
may even have a harmful effect:
they encourage the idea that we are
dealing with a “reasonable” enemy
that, like all reasonable men, is pre-
pared to sit around the table and talk,
when in fact the Communists will
settle for nothing less than total
victory.
There is another reason why Peking
does not want peace. South Vietnam
is a test case for Peking a test of
global importance for its theory of
revolutionary warfare by which it
hopes to establish pro-Peking govern-
ments throughout Asia, Africa and
Latin America. Far from wanting to
negotiate in South Vietnam, it wants
a conquest in order to show superior-
ity of its military methods over
Moscow’s more political techniques of
revolution. To call the war off would
be to admit defeat. The only good that
can come out of the failure of Mr Wil-
son’s mission is to demonstrate yet
again the reality we arc up against.
New Guinean Migrants?
Tn this week’s issue of the magazine
* “New Guinea”, Mr John Kerr,
QC, advocates a modification of
Australian immigration policy to allow
New Guinean migrants to work and
settle in Australia. He points out that
there is a lot of pro-New Guinea sen-
timent in Australia which could be
mobilised in support of such a change
and that the experience gained in hand-
ling that sort of multi-racial immigra-
tion in a sensible and controlled way
would be a useful step towards a
more general reform of immigration
policies.'
Unfortunately, Mr Kerr weakens a
good case by some of the arguments
he uses. "As more and more Tom
Mboyas come to Australia”, he says,
“linking White Australia, Aboriginal
policy and New Guinea policy together,
it will become increasingly diffi-
cult not to deal with New Guinea im-
migration as part of immigration policy
in general.” As things stand, he also
says, “we are going to have a bad
time in international debates”. The
implication seems to be we may have
to make a major change in one of our
traditional policies in order to appease
the representatives of foreign dictator-
ships, where very often minority prob-
lcms are' dealt with by massacre, inl-
prisonment and the suppression of
all opposition. Australians may well
ignore the pressure of most such
“spokesmen for humanity”,
The point is, that we should modify
our immigration policy because we
not foreign dictators or demagogues
_ think it should be reformed. Public
opinion in Australia is changing in
favor of immigration reform; Asian
students have been welcomed here;
Nauruans were invited to settle here;
and there can be little doubt that Mr
Kerr’s proposal for admitting New
Guineans would also work.
Not the least advantage that would
result from such a modification of our
immigration policy is that it would re-
move the ridiculous situation which
now prevails, whereby Papuans as
distinct from the people of the Terri-
tory of New Guinea are Australian
citizens, yet are not free to live in
Australia.
Accountants
Tn a speech on the Companies Act to
an accountants’ luncheon in Syd-
ney last week the new NSW Minister
for Justice, Mr Maddison, raised the
question of investing management with
the same legal responsibility as direc-
tors in the conduct of companies. It is
true, as he said, that something drastic
must be done to restore the status of
the limited company in the public
mind. Yet most people, appreciating
the vital difference between the status
of directors as representatives of the
shareholders and of the management
as paid servants of the company, will
wish to see the present relationship
preserved. The true onus is on the
directors to see that management ful-
fils its responsibilities; if management
gets up to any fiddling tricks the board
is there to detect it and, if necessary,
bring in the law to punish it.
The uniform company legislation
effective from mid-1961 locked the
stable door long after the 1960 boom
horses had bolted away with untold,
and still mostly unrecovered, public
savings. Had many of the safeguards
written into that legislation been in
the Company Acts during the specula-
tive period, company losses might not
have been so severe nor misdemeanors
so prolific. Victoria acted smartly to
plug up new holes driven through the
old Act during the boom by concentrat-
ing its efforts on money secured by
trust deeds, but experience has shown
that this legislation went too far, and
is virtually unworkable in many res-
pects. '
When Mr Maddison starts the
serious business of drafting changes
in company legislation, one can only
hope that he will learn from Victoria’s
rash, peremptory piling up of amend-
ments to its company law. He was, fibr
example, on sounder lines whejY he
supported the idea of strengthei>mg the
powers of accountants to ensytfe audits
independent of the dislikes
of management.


THIS AUSTRALIA
CIVIL NIGHTS
Historic Case
Race justice
For the first time in Australian history
n major court test of the economic rights
of Aborigines will be made in Sydney
next week. Aborigines employed on
cattle stations in the Northern Terri-
tory are claiming equal pay before the
Full Bench of the Commonwealth Con-
ciliation and Arbitration Commission.
The hearing will pitch into dismal
relief the lives of other full-blooded
Aborigines in Queensland, most of
Western Australia, and the northern half
of South Australia.
The case quite rightly will become a
cause celebre. It will be an abrasive to
raw consciences, raising the whole issue
of Australia’s treatment of Aborigines.
The North Australian Workers’ Union,
which is leading the campaign, is plan-
ning a 24-hour stoppage of all unionists
in the Territory on Thursday (July 1),
By BRIAN JOHNS
and various other activist groups will do
what they can to increase the rub.
Already it is being reported—significantly
in the Sydney Communist “Tribune”—
that Aboriginal workers will demonstrate
in Darwin on July 13 when the Com-
mission moves its hearing there.
The Commission will examine for itself
the situation of Aborigines—ranging in
number from 400 on huge holdings
of the type of Elsey and Victoria River
Downs of thousands of square miles in
area to the “smaller” of merely hundreds
of square miles around Alice Springs,
where sometimes there are only handfuls
of Aborigines.
The union is also asking the Com-
mission to vary the Cattle Stations In-
dustry Northern Territory Award to
cover domestic employees including
Aborigines for the first time.
The certainty that overseas attention
will be drawn to the case is one reason
why the Commonwealth has decided to
intervene. But the Department of Terri-
tories has been examining the issue of
Aborigine wages for at least two years
and regards it as the third prong neces-
sary to be surmounted in the removal
of legal discrimination equal voting
and drinking rights having been granted
to Aborigines in the Territory.
However, the Commonwealth, which
will be represented by the Victorian
Queen’s Counsel Mr A. E. Woodward,
will certainly only put forward a scheme
for graduated and not immediate equal
rates of pay for Aborigines. Although
the scheme will seek to endorse the
principle of equality, the Common-
wealth is reported to believe that equal
pay now would threaten both the
Aborigines’ welfare and the economics
of the cattle industry.
The Northern Territory Cattle Pro-
ducers’ Council has engaged two top
Sydney barristers, John Kerr, QC, and
J. H. Wootten, QC, to represent the
interests of the cattle owners against the
claims of the North Australian Workers’
Union, represented by Sydney solicitor
Mr A. T. Brodney. The Australian
Workers’ Union and Graziers’ Associa-
tions in all States will have an immediate
interest in the progress of the case, be-
cause it will be a precedent for a new
Federal Pastoral Industry Award in
which the AWU is also claiming equal
pay for Aboriginal station hands in all
States.
A concession already made by the
employers in this award gives a clear
indication of the nature of the arguments
which will be brought to bear in the
Arbitration hearing commencing on July
7. In answer to the AWU’s log of
claims asking for a complete new Federal
Award, including equality for Aborigines,
which was served last August, the em-
ployers have served their own log con-
ceding equality for Aborigines employed
on properties in New South Wales, Vic-
toria, Tasmania, those employed in the
South-West land division of Western
Australia and those “north of the 31st
Parallel of the south latitude of South
Australia”. In other words, Aborigines
from long-detribalised areas.
This concession—which in itself in-
dicates that cattle owners are now pre-
pared to pay Aboriginal station hands
at the same rate as others, for work of
equal value, in the same way that they
have done for Aboriginal shearers and
pressers—will strengthen the employers’
Juries: The Chief Justice's Defence
The retention
of juries for all
“impond e r a b 1 e
and serious”
third party motor
vehicle cases has
been recom-
mended by the
Chief Justice of
New South
Wales, Mr Justice
L. J. Herron, and
MR JUSTICE HERRON
by Mr Justice K. W. Asprey of the
Supreme Court of NSW in a paper
prepared for the Third Common-
wealth and Empire Law Conference
opening in Sydney in August.
Their programme is bound to
command the enthusiastic backing of
NSW barristers who now have the
support of the State's leading lawyer
in their campaign for the retention of
the jury system.
The judges suggest that their
scheme, which they “hesitantly out-
line”, be considered at the meeting
of Chief Justices and Attorneys-
General in Canberra after the Sydney
conference ends on September 1. In
the paper, called “The Motor Car and


central argument: they do not pay the
same wages to Aboriginal stockmen and
station hands, because the great majority
are not prepared or capable of an equal
day’s work with other Australians.
Full - blooded Northern Territory
Aborigines are not included in census
statistics, so there are only estimates of
the number affected by the Arbitration
claim. One informed calculation puts
the figure at 1500 male station hands,
of whom 1100 are regarded as full-time
employees (the great majority are stock-
men). But this last figure is arrived at
by “averaging” out the time worked by
the full 1500 and concluding that it
amounts to full-time efforts by 1100!
A deep and wrenching problem for
the Commission will be the possibility
that pay equality for Aborigines, or even
an immediate substantial increase, could
cause the station owners to decide to do
without Aboriginal help. Certainly, as
some stations have already shown, a
fencing programme, well-boring, more
crushing yards, etc., greatly reduces the
need for labor. The employers will as
surely point out this danger as will the
union point to the imbalance of present
wage scales, where adult Aborigines in
the Northern Territory are entitled only
to a minimum wage of £3 3s. 3d. a week
and a maximum wage of £ll plus
accommodation,- food, clothing and
“other necessities” for their wife and
first child.
The Commonwealth Government has
been considering two proposals for a
system of graduated increases. For
example, the first could be worked out
on a basis of experience 5O per cent
of the Australian wage after three years,
say 75 per cent after four, and so on.
The other proposal involves a straight-out
estimate of skill. Employers and unions
are sceptical of any graduated scheme,
but this could well turn out to be the
area of compromise. On the other hand,
none of the parties at this stage—under-
standably with the court hearing still
ahead is prepared to admit that it
would be satisfied with the Commission
finding for a limited increase now, with
tbe prospect of full equality being
granted at the negotiation of a new
award in, say, five years although in
some quarters such an outcome has been
considered.
Whatever the outcome, the course of
the case can only sharpen the realisation
of the present poverty of Federal Gov-
ernment and community measures for
the integration of Aborigines. Claims
and counter-claims that Aborigines do
or do not have the simple mechanical
knowledge to see to the correct operation

and water; the doubt that neither union
nor Government has the ability to police
an award covering Aborigines in the
Northern Territory are details which
will heighten the basic depressing fact
posed by next week’s hearing after
many decades wage equality is still only
an idea which, if fulfilled, may remove
Aborigines not to another job even out-
side their traditional home, but to the
mendicancy of still-inadequate Govern-
ment settlements.
the Law”, they declare that: “Prob-
lems are of such proportions that it
is difficult to find a solution in exist-
ing law and procedures.”
They recommend that juries should
assess damages in all cases where it
is probable that damages will exceed
£6OOO. They suggest, however, that
judges assess damages in fatal cases
not exceeding £6OOO and in non-fatal
accident cases in which it is probable
that the damages awarded will not
exceed £3OOO. In cases falling within
both the £6OOO and £3OOO categories
these categories of claims to be
decided by a judge before trial the
judges should have the discretion of
allowing costs. Justice Herron and
Justice Asprey stress that “damages
would still be assessed by a jury in
all the more imponderable and serious
cases”.
One controversial suggestion, likely
to be opposed by insurance companies,
is that in all non-fatal accident cases
decided by a jury, the tribunal should
be given the power to award con-
tinuing weekly payments “in lieu of
damages for future economic loss”.
These payments would be a weekly
sum not exceeding 75 per cent of the
average net weekly earnings of the
person claiming damages. These
weekly payments which similarly
could be made for continuing medical
or other out-of-pocket expenses
would be terminated by the provision
of a bulk sum on agreement.
In another controversial suggestion
they want to abolish the need for
those claiming damages to prove
negligence by the defendants. They
also regret that in NSW, as .in some
other legal systems, contributory
negligence by the plaintiff wipes out
his right to damages. The judges
point out the extreme difficulty of
objectively assessing the “fault” of the
defendant on the one hand, and the
absence of “fault” by the claimant on
the other.
“We can recall a great number of
instances where a plaintiff has suc-
ceeded although the defendant was
innocent of guilt. For a motor car,
travelling at a legal speed of thirty
miles per hour, travels forty-four feet
per second; and allowing for reaction
time, a half second or twenty-two
feet, the car needs, with good four-
wheel brakes, a further forty-seven
feet in which to stop. When the
combined speeds of two approaching
vehicles are considered, accidents take
place in fractions of a second. By
reason of the frailty of human
observation evidence of ‘fault’ must
be suspect. Added complexities are
a moment of inattention, natural
fatigue, distraction or state of health,
so that ‘fault’ of a careful driver
may frequently be a substitute for
error of judgment.”
As well as abolishing the claimants’
need to prove negligence, the judges
suggest that defences be limited to
the assertions that the plaintiff’s claim
is fraudulent or the result of his
intentional act. They also suggest
that where a driver, following an
injury, is found guilty of a traffic
breach the court should be able to
order a surcharge on his driver’s
licence for a specified period.
The judges conclude that if their
measures were introduced everyone
injured in a car accident would be
guaranteed compensation; congestion
of the damages’ list would be elimi-
nated and the period between accident
and trial shortened; out -of - court
settlements would be quicker and
“rehabilitation of the injured in a
situation free of anxiety”.

DROUGHT
At Last
More than a statistic
The drought received official recogni-
tion last week. Meteorological statistics
were issued for the seven months
November-May, to show that five areas
in New South Wales had recorded the
lowest rainfall for this period since
figures have been collected.
Opening the annual convention of the
Australian Woolgrowers’ and Graziers’
Council, the Minister for Primary In-
dustry, Mr C. F. Adermann, delivered
himself of these profundities: “This
present setback emphasises the neces-
sity for long-term planning of a con-
tinuous programme during the good
years to minimise the effects of drought
when it comes. Such an approach calls
for a concerted programme of attack
by Commonwealth and State Govern-
ments, and all other relevant institutions
and instrumentalities, in conjunction
with producers.”
The Federal Government itself be-
came more deeply involved—in a survey
of the situation. Cabinet had before it,
at a Sydney meeting, urgent claims for
additional assistance from NSW and
Queensland.
Meanwhile, for good measure, the
Acting Prime Minister, Mr J. McEwen,
told the NSW Country Party’s annual
conference that the overseas reserves
would drop by about £174 million in
the 1964-65 financial year, and “it would
not be an unreasonable estimate to say
that in a year’s time our reserves may
have fallen by as much again”.
By VICTOR WORSTEAD
A considerable proportion of this
dangerous decline will be due to falling
volumes and prices of major rural exports
(wool, wheat, sugar, meat), not simply to
harsher financial and trading policies
instigated by the United States and Great
Britain.
To cap the picture, the brief and
fairly widespread rains that fell last
week brought after them bitter cold to
many country regions. Already weakened
stock, both cattle and sheep, must suffer
further heavy depletion. The rain was
not enough to benefit either stock feed
or wheat crops.
This is the roll call of officially-
branded drought areas: Southern and
western Queensland; the whole of NSW
except the Tweed-Lismore district, the
southern coastal division and the
Riverina; the whole north of South Aus-
tralia; the Alice Springs district of the
Northern Territory; parts of the East
Kimberleys of Western Australia.
“Conditions elsewhere are generally
very dry, but not so serious as to be
described as drought stricken,” a
seasonal survey states.
Mr T. L. Bull, retiring president of
the Woolgrowers and Graziers’ Coun-
cil, summarised the effects of the drought
on farmers: “The sheep and cattle which
are dying represent national assets which
take from three to five years to replace
. . . The products of these livestock earn
over 50 per cent of the nation’s export
income and it could be said that one-
half to two-thirds of the total sheep and
cattle are normally depastured over the
area hit by the drought.”


RESERVE PRICE
The Wool Vote
" Changing direction ”
The most important fact about last
week’s meeting of the Australian Wool
Industry Conference was that it hap-
pened in Sydney where most of the
opposition to Sir William Gunn’s Reserve
Price Scheme for Wool has been centred.
The conference voted 45 to 5 in favor
of the scheme in a major setback for its
opponents.
Sydney is where the wool industry
began, where historical links are strong,
and where Australia’s only wool futures
market operates. It has some great family
fortunes founded on wool, and for nearly
a century the direction of the wool in-
dustry would take could be ascertained
in the Australian and Union Clubs of
Sydney.
The result of the conference is a
further indication to the opponents of
the scheme that the wool industry is
changing direction—unless they can rally
support between now and the referendum.
The traditionally influential NSW
Graziers’ Association rejected the reserve
price scheme a few days before the wool
industry conference, but then, remark-
ably, the NSW president, Mr T. B. C.
Walker, announced he personally favored
the scheme; and next the Federal presi-
dent of the association, Mr T. Bull,
said he too was in favor. The Federal
body of the State Graziers’ Associations
the Wool Growers and Graziers’
Council—decided to permit delegates to
the Wool Industry Conference to vote
as they saw fit. The council has 25 seats
on the Wool Industry Conference, the
other 25 seats being held by the Aus-
tralian Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation which all along has been in
favor of the Wool Price Scheme.
It is convenient, if not strictly
accurate, to regard the Wool Growers
and Graziers’ Council as representing big
growers and the Wool and Meat Pro-
ducers’ Federation the small mixed
farmers. The Federation cast its 25
votes in favor; the Council representa-
tives voted 20 to 5 in favor. The five dis-
senting included some of the NSW
delegates with one or possibly two from
South Australia. Until this Sydney meet-
ing, the precise attitude of the Wool
Industry Conference was uncrystallised.
A vote had never been taken.
One other point that will have to be
remembered by the campaigners against
the Reserve Price Scheme is that outside
NSW the idea of the scheme leading
to some form of acquisition is regarded
with less fear than in NSW. In Victoria
and Western Australia especially, many
growers, far from fearing an acquisi-
tion plan, fervently want just that. They
regard it as something which could do
for wool what the Wheat Stabilisation
Plan (a form of acquisition) has done
for wheat.
They may be naive; wool and wheat
are two entirely different commodities,
especially in the marketing sphere where
all wheat prices can be related to the
f.a.q. But the success of the wheat
stabilisation plan is a powerful influence
on many woolgrowers. Bureaucracy has
put more money in their pockets than
they ever thought possible. This is what
the critics of Sir William Gunn’s scheme
are up against.
VIETNAM
The First Lists
...and it appears an accident
PRIVATE JOHN McDONOUGH, of NSW, at the No. 1 Mortar Pit which th«
crew have named "Sufferer's Paradise".
For Australians, the war in Vietnam
suddenly became very real this week as
newspapers carried on their front pages
the first of what must become more
regular casualty lists. Ironically there
had not been any direct contact with
the Vietcong. In what looked like an
accident (sabotage was not ruled out as
an investigation started) two Victorians,
Private M. A Bourke and Private W. T.
Carroll were killed.
A grenade exploded near a truck which
had just brought them back to Bien Hoa
base from their battalion’s first “Search
and Destroy” mission. An American with
the Australians was killed and 10 other
members of “C” Company, Ist Battalion
were injured. Another company, “B”
Company,- flushed out two Vietcong
camps, were fired on, but got only “a
glimpse” as the guerrillas escaped. Mean-
while, efforts for negotiations continued
in the United States and in London.
According to the “New York Times”
President Johnson made his strongest bid
yet for negotiations on the 20th anniver-
sary of the UN in San Francisco. He
sought UN help he did not say how
in getting the Communists to the con-
ference table. He said: “I call upon this
gathering of the nations of the world to
use their influence, individually and col-
lectively, to bring to the table those who
seem determined to make war. We will
support their efforts, as we will support
effective action by any agent or agency of
these United Nations. Reaction to the
speech was mixed. The delegates, many
of whom oppose US policy in Vietnam,
applauded only mildly. And many won-
dered what the UN could do that has not
been done in previous attempts at nego-
tiation.
As President Johnson spoke at San
Francisco, the situation in Vietnam was
getting nastier and more dangerous. Re-
inforcements were being marshalled in
the worsening ground fighting. The
United States pushed its air raids on
North Vietnam close to the Communist
Chinese frontier. In Saigon the govern-
ment publicly executed a terrorist and
the Communists retaliated swiftly with
the execution of a captured American
soldier and the bombing of a Saigon
restaurant in the capital’s worst act of
terrorism of the war.
A major reason that the impasse in


Vietnam holds is that the three principal
powers involved the US, North Viet-
nam and Communist China each had
one hand tied behind his back. The res-
pective positions are as follows:
The United States the Johnson
administration, for the time being, is
limiting its ground operations to support
of the South Vietnamese forces against
Vietcong assaults, and its aerial bombing
of North Vietnam to selected military
and transportation targets. To extend the
ground fighting to North Vietnam, or the
air raids to North Vietnamese cities,
would risk provoking land intervention
by Hanoi’s 400,000-man army, and
possibly Peking’s forces of 2.5 million.
North Vietnam Hanoi has not com-
mitted its regular army to the fighting be-
cause of the certainty of American
retaliation. US planes, from land bases
and aircraft carriers, could make short
work of the industry which the North
Vietnamese have so painstakingly built
up. Moreover, Hanoi is said to believe
that the Vietcong guerrillas can win the
war under the present conditions.
Communist China Like Hanoi,
Peking is well aware of its vulnerability
to bold US aerial retaliation in the event
of a ground attack on South Vietnam. It
is said to be particularly worried about
destruction of its nuclear installations.
Recent US bombing near the Chinese
frontier and introduction of huge,
nuclear-capable B-52s into American
operations were regarded by many as
reminders to the Chinese. Because of its
vulnerability, Peking is said to be count-
ing on the Americans eventually tiring of
the war under constant Vietcong
hammering.
There have been 15 attempts to bring
the Communists to negotiations, starting
with President Johnson’s “unconditional
discussions” offer of April 7. The 14th
and 15th came last week a Common-
wealth peace mission and Mr Johnson’s
UN speech. The Commonwealth initia-
tive was proposed by British Prime Minis-
ter Harold Wilson at the 21-nation Com-
monwealth conference in London. A
communique listed the mission’s objec-
tives as: first, suspension of US air
attacks on North Vietnam, second, halt-
ing of infiltration of men and supplies
from North Vietnam to the South, third,
a cease-fire to permit a peace conference.
Peking denounced the Commonwealth
initiative as “a hoax”; Hanoi called the
mission “an intrigue approved by Wash-
ington to carry out a peaceful negotiation
swindle”. Moscow said, “the Soviet
Government has not been authorised by
anyone to conduct talks on a settlement
in Vietnam”.
With no negotiations in sight it seemed
clear that the US and Australia would
be involved in Vietnam for a long time.
Important clues to the future probably
would not come before the end of the
summer. The Communists will not clarify
their position on negotiations until the
results of the Vietcong’s monsoon offen-
sive are known. Secretary Rusk forecast
“a long, hard summer of fighting in which
our losses may increase more”.
ADOPTION
Buying Babies
The new legislation
“Dear Mr : Don’t think too hard
of me for writing what I am. You want
and you want to adopt her legally.
I will do this on consideration you find
£5O to help me and my baby (a younger
son) to get right away from here. With
money behind me I have a better chance
for my baby and myself.”
This was scrawled on the back of a
Newcastle store’s advertising leaflet in
1959, and addressed to a Newcastle man
who wanted to adopt the woman’s three-
year-old daughter. The man, who said
he “refused to bargain for the girl like
buying an article in a shop”, produced
the letter to a Sydney newspaper after
reading reports that the Child Welfare
Department feared a tendency toward
black-marketing of babies in NSW.
Shortly the State Government will
introduce legislation to prevent black-
marketing of babies by generally tighten-
ing up adoption laws. The NSW Child
Welfare Act of 1939 follows along the
By GORDON CHESTERMAN
lines of the English Act and the proposed
legislation will spell this out more
thoroughly. Specific provision will be
made for the recognition of Australian
adoptions, and adoptions made in coun-
tries outside of the Commonwealth or
its territories. Arrangements will be in-
cluded under which adoption orders
may be registered and birth registration
altered. A new provision will enable a
person over the age of 21 to be legally
adopted in certain circumstances, and
a consent to the adoption of a child may
be revoked by the natural parent only
before the expiration of 30 days from
the date on which the consent was signed.
The Premier, R. W. Askin has said the
proposed legislation would not be
advanced as a uniform measure requiring
the passage of identical legislation by
each of the other States. And while a
degree of uniformity has been presented
in relation to more technical aspects of
adoption, each State has expressed dif-
ferences as to the arrangements under
which adoptions may be made. Accord-
ingly, procedures may vary from State
to State.
Unified adoption laws were first dis-
cussed by the standing committee of the
Attorneys-General in 1961, and since then
the States had discussed fully the social
and legal aspects of adoption. Mr Askin
said the defeated NSW Labor-Govern-
ment had completed the drafting of a
Bill and legislation was to have been
introduced. Under the proposed legisla-
tion it will not be possible for an adop-
tion to take place where applicants have
obtained possession of the child, unless
the child concerned is a relative of the
applicants. Penalties may be imposed
under the legislation where: the natural
parent tries to remove, or does remove,
a child from the possession of the adopt-
ing parents; payments are made, received,
or agreed upon for the arrangement of
an adoption; advertisements, news items
or other matter are published on the
possibility of arranging an adoption.
Such restrictions, said Mr Askin, will
do much to avoid the scandals of baby
black-marketing.
Black-marketing of babies came first
into public eye in 1956 when it was
reported that a mother offered her nine-
month - old baby girl and another
daughter of three for adoption for £450.
Two years later, a Sydney man who had
adopted three children claimed in the
daily papers that he had been asked to
pay as much as £lOOO for a baby.
But the question of legality of parents
wanting to traffic in babies was initially
raised by Mr Justice Manning in the
NSW Supreme Court in 1961 (it was
after this that the Attorneys-General
discussed the issue) when he disclosed
there was a loophole in the Child Wel-
fare Act, and that by law parents were
permitted to dispose of their children for
financial gain. Mr Justice Manning dis-
closed this during a judgment in an
application by a migrant couple for an
adoption order. A nurse (a relative) had
arranged for the couple to pay hospital
expenses and arranged for the natural
parents to retain the “baby bonus”. Com-
mented the judge: In the result the
natural parents benefited financially by
about £65.
Acting on this, the State Act was
amended to provide that no person was
entitled to receive payment over the
adoption of a child, and to back this a
breach could bring a fine of £lOO or a
year in gaol, or both. In the new legisla-
tion the fine will be increased to £2OO
and the gaol sentence halved.


AVIATION
The Jet Set
Noises over the Tasman
Hard bargaining is the prelude to Air
New Zealand's first jet service scheduled
from Christchurch to Sydney in October,
and the first step in a big expansion pro-
gramme to North America and Asia.
Rights have been negotiated with the
United States, Malaysia and Britain.
Qantas, BOAC, and Pan American are all
allowed into New Zealand but it is un-
likely that Air India and Alitalia will be
allowed entry for some years. Canadian
Pacific is negotiating at present, and UTA
could be included if New Zealand and
France negotiate a new air rights agree-
ment.
Aviation observers say that although
Indian and Italian airlines officials have
made “noises” on both sides of the Tas-
man over servicing New Zealand, no
firm Government-to-Government repre-
sentations have been made. Obviously
this is because Air New Zealand has no
immediate plans to extend to Europe or
India.
Japan, a strong tourist country, is con-
sidered of much greater interest and an
exchange of air rights with Tokyo will
precede any similar exchange with other
countries beyond the Pacific. But New
Zealand has not yet straightened things
out with the French. Eighteen months
ago the French Government stopped
New Zealand flights to Tahiti, and in
return New Zealand stopped UTA flights
between New Zealand and New Cale-
donia.
The French then negotiated new deals
to serve New Caledonia alone and in the
case of New Zealand an arrangement
was made for Air NZ (then Teal) to run
a weekly service to New Caledonia. This
agreement expired almost three months
ago, but the service is still continuing
with three months cancellation on
either side.
KEN COATES
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
Hanging
Legislation
Change for South Australia
The South Australian Government is
preparing legislation to implement the
first clause in the SA Labor Party’s plat-
form on legal and prison reform: aboli-
tion of capital and corporal punishment.
South Australia and Western Austra-
lia are the only remaining “hanging
States" and are among the last strong-
holds of capital punishment in the West-
ern world. But in SA, where all changes
come slowly, opinion on the issue is still
very much divided. The State’s last hang-
iog, that of Glen Sabre.Valance last year,
was followed within days by two mur-
ders, but the advocates of hanging as a
deterrent are still vocal in SA. There
have been calls for a referendum on the
issue, including one from Opposition
member Frank Potter.
More important has been the pressure
for abolition of capital punishment to
become a first step towards a saner treat-
ment of criminals. Improved rehabilita-
tion methods, particularly for juveniles
and detection and treatment of emotional
disorders among children have been
suggested.
POLITICS
3 for See-saw
A split Qld coalition?
The decision late last week by the
Liberal Party Convention to oppose the
Country Party in several seats at the next
State election was the most significant
made in Queensland politics for eight
years. On the surface, it had many of
the ingredients which led to the split in
the ALP in Queensland in 1957.
Soon after the Liberal Party decision-
was announced, the Country Party
President, Mr J. Ahern, said: “We will
consider retaliation.” The Liberal Party
at the weekend made it clear that it
would contest two seats Albert and
South Coast held by the Country
Party. In retaliation, the Country Party
is expected to consider contesting
Toowoomba East, Bowen, Lockyer,
Mount Coot-tha and Mount Gravatt.
Liberal Party officials have said that
in seats where the two parties will clash
an effort will be made to reach “work-
able agreements”. But there seems cer-
tain to be bitter clashes between the two
parties who have dominated Queensland
politics, arm-in-arm, since 1957'. For last
week several Country Party members
made it quite clear that they intended
to take action to ensure that the Liberal
Party did not “cash in” on the good
image of the Queensland Premier, Mr
Frank Nicklin.
Told of the Liberal Party decision,
Mr Nicklin said: “I am certain it will
not be to the advantage of the Country
Party-Liberal Government which has
done so much for Queensland.” But Mr
Ahern was more blunt. He said that the
Liberals were prepared to ignore the
welfare of Queensland in a bid for
greater power. It is believed that the
Liberal Party may soon consider con-
testing other Country Party seats besides
Albert and South Coast. There seems no
doubt that the Liberal Party is making
an all-out bid for sole control of the
Queensland Parliament.
Last week many old members and
some Liberal parliamentarians were still
shaking their heads in disbelief at their
party’s decision. One said, “This decision
is going to have far - reaching con-
sequences—not only here but Federally.”
PUBLIC SERVICE
Sympathy?
A host of claims
Commonwealth and New South Wales
public servants suffered reverses in
separate wage claims last week.
Whether the Commonwealth public
servants will do better when the Public
Service Arbitrator, Mr E. A. Chambers,
considers outstanding claims of the
Administrative and Clerical Officers’
Association for 20,000 members this
week in Melbourne remains to be seen.
But in Canberra last week, according to
the Association’s Federal secretary, Mr
S. Imer, the Commonwealth Public Ser-
vice Board “double-crossed us”. The
Association criticised the Board's sugges-
tion that the claims (14 special claims
from the Association, plus a general
wage claim, and 16 claims from seven
other unions) be dealt with jointly.
“We went to Canberra to discuss a
series of claims. At no time did the Board
tell us that five days before they met us
they had handed the matter over to the
Arbitrator,” Mr Imer said. Each claim
was separate and dealt with the special
merits of a particular group of officers,
and should only be dealt with separately.
At present, officials of the Association,
headed by the Federal president, Mr N. J.
Campbell, and representatives of the
seven other unions now involved, are
negotiating with the Arbitrator for the
fixation of appropriate salary rates.
Meanwhile, in Sydney, on Thursday
officials of the State Public Service
Association on behalf of members of the
Administrative and Clerical Division
(completely divorced from the Admini-
strative and Clerical Officers’ Association)
will approach the Premier Mr R. W.
Askin over their salary claims. Last week
the division had its claims for increases
ranging from £7O to £3BO rejected by the
State Public Service Board.
The Board made a determination
granting increases from £25 to £220 for
State public servants on salaries of
£2348, or over.
Troubles in the division first came to
light on the eve of the State elections.
The division threatened to withdraw its
“confidence” in the State Government
unless Mr J. Renshaw intervened to get
negotiations under way. At that time the
chairman of the division, Mr A. C.
Edwards, pointed out that his members
had been pressing for increases since last
November. But Renshaw’s Government
refused and the claims were referred to
the Board.

AROUND MELBOURNE
The Agony of King Kong
“A love that lay hidden for a million years"
Tf one had several television sets, then
-*■ this week one could watch a total
of 45 old American movies. So you
see it would be a blessing if the Com-
monwealth Film Censor banned more
films than he does. If, say, he banned
40 out of the 45 our culture would
be enriched by 60 hours of better
viewing, and who knows, some of the
channels might provide us with some
of these long-promised Australian pro-
ductions.
But the over-censored Victorian
must not look at things that way.
When you are looking at the principle
of the thing you mustn’t get your prin-
ciples mixed. Recently ATV-0 decided
to revive the 1933 shocker “King
Kong”. They chose the regular 8.30
p.m. Monday night slot, at the begin-
ning of the “Adult Only” period when
all children, theoretically, are in bed
or watching their homework. For days
Channel 0 was in agony because it had
received no clearance from the Com-
monwealth Film Censorship and
“King Kong” had to be postponed.
The ATV-0 PR department im-
mediately explained that “King Kong”
was “an accepted classic”. This was
one of the first films to make large use
of trick photography, of optical illu-
sions. When King Kong knocked
down skyscrapers, clawed aeroplanes
out of the sky and ate people, he was
preparing the way for all the monsters
that were to follow. All was to no
avail. The Film Censorship Board,
despite the fact that “King Kong” had
been regular fare at kids’ matinees for
years, banned the ape throughout
Australia. As we went to press ATV-0
had appealed against the decision and
was hoping for a change of mind
this week. It was an interesting situa-
tion. Censorship correspondents to
“The Age” were not quite as outraged
as usual, although this beautifully suc-
cinct letter appeared in “The Herald”:
“The banning of the film ‘King Kong’
for showing on TV was to be expec-
ted. A film title consisting of two four-
letter words is intolerable. —Charlotte
Hartwig, Balaclava Road, East St
Kilda.”
To get a clear idea of the nature
of “King Kong” the only thing to do
was to hunt back through the files and
discover what happened in 1933.
“King Kong” opened at the Capitol on
July 15, 1933. It replaced the
Academy Award winner “Three Little
Pigs” by Walt Disney. Everybody
agreed it was a brilliant change of
pace.
The great advertisements depicted
an ape rather larger than the Capitol
drooling over a deshabillee Fay Wray.
Underneath were the words “Censor-
ship Warning —nervous tempera-
ments are warned of intense excite-
ment in ‘King Kong'.” Then there
were some good lines. “The most
exciting picture the world will ever
see.” ... “A love that lay hidden for
a million years flamed in the beast.”
... “The strangest adventure-drama
this thrill-mad world has ever seen.”
. . . “Stark terror froze the blood of
thousands when a beautiful girl no
larger than the apelike monster's hand
matched strength against the raging
mountain of muscle.”
The most complete review of “King
Kong” appeared in “Table Talk”,
which graded its films excellent, very
good, good, pass, fail. “Kong” just
managed a pass. The reviewer said:
“Prior to my seeing ‘King Kong’,
which commenced at the Capitol on
Saturday night, it was explained to
me that my reactions to Kong, the
mammoth ape, would be neither fear
nqr hatred. ‘When you see this huge
monster pick up the white girl and
gaze at her standing on the palm of
his huge paw, you’ll feel sorry for
her,’ I was told.
“Strangely enough I felt neither
fear, hatred nor pity for Kong. When
I sat there gazing upon him ploughing
through the jungle, flinging trees from
his path with but one sweep and his
arm tugging down overhead railways,
demolishing buildings with one care-
less gesture and picking up handfuls
of men and sprinkling them around
the countryside, one thought leapt up-
permost in my mind: ‘What a dandy
half-back he’d make for Carlton.’ For
‘King Kong’ is one of those super
fantastic films which has scant hope
of being taken seriously.”
Our reviewer goes on to explain that
the most hilarious part of the film is
this impossible carnal passion that the
Empire State size ape has for little
Fay Wray. And at the finish there is
the hilarious line always to be trea-
sured when Robert Armstrong says
over the dead Kong: “It wasn't the
aeroplanes that killed him, it was
beauty.” It seems a great pity that
Australian viewers are now missing
out on all this healthy laughter. Any-
way, perhaps to prime things a little,
last week ATV-0 invited a few people
to the studio for a private viewing of
“Kong”. But in my delving through
old files I discovered one thing which
I think is yet unrealised by ATV-0.
“King Kong” was such a success that
in 1934 there was a sequel “The Son
of King Kong”.
The film opened just where “King
Kong” finished. The promoter who
took Kong to New York is faced with
the appalling bill for all the damage,
three or four wrecked skyscrapers, the
odd overhead railway, about 200 dead
cops, a decimated air force, etc. He
goes on a lone boat trip, he drifts back
to the remote island where he found
Kong and, 10, he discovers that Kong
had a dear little 20-foot baby. Much
the same sort of thing happens, much
carnage, much wreckage, much
romance, but it all ends in an appal-
ling earthquake. JThe island is de-
stroyed along with all its oversize pre-
historic 'monsters. This was a sad
and regrettable way to finish the film
because we have to break the sad
news to ATV-0. It made it quite
impossible for King Kong to have a
grandson.

The End of
the White Knights
Menzies as a bulldog mascot?
SIR ROBERT MENZIES, PRESIDENT NYERERE of Tanzania and DR NKRUMAH of Ghana
at the Commonwealth Conference.
From COLIN LEGUM in London
W.ule none of the Commonwealth
leaders feels that the . angry con-
troversies of the last ten days
presage the break-up of the Common-
wealth, all are agreed that the Common-
wealth has been greatly shaken up. But
they believe that the Commonwealth will
survive if it can absorb the changes
which are being forced on it.
Mr Harold Wilson says gleefully that
the Commonwealth will never again be
the same. He is enthusiastic about the
success of his venturesome policy as a
condition for the survival of the Com-
monwealth. He entered the conference
with a clear choice: whether to get the
highest common level of agreement by
keeping the temperature on controversial
issues as low as possible, or whether to
raise the temperature in order to get
maximum agreement on important
questions.
The success of his policy meant a
willingness to risk the future unity of
the conference by abandoning the
traditional view that there must be
general agreement on crucial issues. He
claims to have achieved “virtual
unanimity”.
Canada’s Prime Minister, Lester
Pearson, is a warm supporter of the
Wilson doctrine on the New Common-
wealth. The Commonwealth, he says,
having ceased to be kinship in which “we
were* 1 all Kipling’s children” has become
a very much more difficult family to hold
together. “Yet it has become more im-
portant than ever to maintain its
existence.”
He believes that the Commonwealth
has a chance of. success, only if it is
willing to take up the controversial
issues which face it and the rest of the
world. “But it is increasingly difficult
to deal with these controversial questions
while maintaining the rule of unanimity
and seeking to get unanimous com-
muniques.”
These views are shared by most of
the Commonwealth leaders I spoke to.
One African President told me: “This
conference has shaken the Common-
wealth perhaps more than any since the
question of South Africa came up in
196 i. This has been a good thing. But
the crucial test of the future is whether
the necessary changes will be accepted.
What happened at this conference was
that the new Commonwealth members
finally showed the White Knights that
they could no longer insist on having
things their own way. While they had
accepted the physical changes of the
new Commonwealth they had not yet
accepted the changes in thinking that
must accompany it. And that applies
to Mr Wilson no less than to anybody
else.” He added that it would be a good
thing to help promote this change if
the conference were to meet for the next
three years in Commonwealth capitals
other than in London.
Several Afro-Asian leaders expressed
shock at the views expressed on TV by
the Conservative Foreign Affairs spokes-
man, Mr Reginald Maudling, who
appeared to be saying that the Conserva-
tives were not prepared to see the loss
of “British leadership of the British
Commonwealth”.
The Commonwealth was transformed
by the conference in two ways. First, by
its willingness to deal with controversial
issues without insisting on the need for
unanimity among its members, and,
secondly, by its appointment of a Com-
monwealth secretary to co-ordinate
relations at a time when the association
is entering its most difficult phase.
Although many “hard words” —to
quote Mr Wilson were spoken at the
conference and especially outside it,
there was little evidence yesterday of
rankling bad feelings among Common-
wealth leaders. I saw one Common-
wealth leader who had crossed swords
angrily with Mr Wilson unwrapping a
special-delivery gift of a silver-framed
autographed portrait of the British Prime
Minister. He was pretty touched by the
gift. “Well, isn't that nice of him!”
While making no attempt to hide
their disagreements, the Commonwealth
leaders generally expressed the view that
the Commonwealth is now stronger than
before the conference began. Even Sir
Robert Menzies the Commonwealth
leader most out of sympathy with what
has been happening within the associa-
tion seems to have accepted the
changes without rancor. He greatly
admired Mr Wilson's toughness in
negotiations, and he contented himself
with the role of brusquely but good-
naturedly growling out his dissent in

terms like: “You can’t dictate wnai
should be done. You can only urge that
things should be done.” The Afro-
Asians seem to have adopted him as a
kind of bulldog mascot.
Even the African leader most out of
step with the rest President Nyerere
of Tanzania—remains firmly committed
to the value of the Commonwealth. He
admits that he felt “terrible” about being
isolated twice in the conference but he
refuses to admit that this should be
regarded as an estrangement between
himself and the rest of the Common-
wealth.
The leader who had to make most of
the concessions to achieve “virtual
unanimity” on the final communique was
Mr Wilson. Perhaps the most astonish-
ing result of the conference was the
manner in which British policy was either
changed or appeared to have been
changed under the pressures of the Com-
monwealth talks. The most significant
change, perhaps, was a clear commit-
ment by Mr Wilson for a suspension of
all United States air attacks on North
Vietnam. This was linked to its former
position of demanding the suspension of
North Vietnamese support for military
activities in South Vietnam.
Mr Wilson will, no doubt, reassure
Washington that he adopted-this position
as “chairman of the conference” and
not as British Prime Minister. Whether
President Johnson will find it at all
easy to accept this distinction remains
to be seen.
The other important shift of policy
was Britain’s willingness to subscribe to
a passage in which “the meeting took
note of the widely expressed regret at
the failure of the Portuguese Govern-
ment to give due recognition to the
legitimate political aspirations of the
peoples of the Portuguese territories in
Africa.” This was followed by the more
specific expression of “support for the
application of the principle of self-
determination to the inhabitants of
Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese
Guinea”.
While Britain's agreement to the
declaration on Rhodesia is mainly
ambiguous, Mr Wilson committed him-
self specifically to the-principle of “one-
man one-vote” in Rhodesia.
The Commonwealth leader who gained
most from the conference was Malaysia’s
Tunku Abdul Rahman who had the
satisfaction of finding all his Afro-Asian
colleagues promising full diplomatic
support for “his efforts to preserve the
sovereign independence and integrity of
his country”.
The Cyprus Government similarly
obtained full diplomatic support for its
stand in support of the island's self-
determination.


Paddy’s in an Age of Affluence
“Even doctors 9 wives from Rose Bay ”
By JAN SMITH
An Indian woman in a magenta sari
changing her gold sandals for stout
walking shoes at 30s. . . . children
pleading for goldfish . . . first-timers
learning the art of olive-pickling from
hesitant Greek housewives, or taking
home their first aubergine. And, above
all, in the great cabbage-smelling barn of
Sydney’s Paddy’s Market, the signs advis-
ing, in five languages, against spitting.
The official name is the Retail Market.
The name Paddy’s, applying equally to
Chinese or Irish who formed the bulk of
the growers and buyers, originated in
the last century.
The old Belmore Markets, where the
Tivoli Theatre now stands, sold animals,
hay and chaff as well “There was a real
carnival atmosphere,” said a City Markets
official “Hoop-la, clay ducks, the lot.”
The markets began to move’to a new
site in 1909, where the present Agents’
Market now stands and Friday night
trading ceased during World War II to
save electricity. The present site, bordered
by Hay, Harbour, Lackey and Little Pier
Streets, w'as taken up in 1938.
Stalls are hired for 13/- a day, which,
the official said, proves that the City
Council is not out for big profits, and
regards the markets as a public utility.
There is an application now before the
Council for a fee rise, but there are
plenty of spare stalls down at the Pier
Street end, and the waiting list is not
long.
Applications for stalls increase around
Mother’s Day and Christmas, when toys,
slippers and nightgowns come into their
own. Regulars have long ago been allotted
the footway benches, superior sites be-
cause they mean customers can avoid the
trucks on the roadways. Casual stall-
holders, short of a trestle, can hire one
from a man called Tony at a.nearby pub.
The Markets official, who has done
some research into the good old days of
the Belmore Markets, said the Retail
Market has changed in character. Before
the war, he said, stallholders were mainly
Australians and Jewish people. Today
they are mostly New Australians.
Is there any chance that Paddy's will
be moved? No one seems too worried at
finding themselves ordered out to Flem-
ington. When the plan for moving the
fruit and vegetable section was suggested
five years ago, Paddy’s was included, but
although some stallholders are reported
to be worried, others happily estimated
that such a move would take at least 15
years.
But if Paddy’s does go, it will be hard
luck for the people w'ho depend on it
as something more essential than a happy
bargainsville the pregnant women with
broods of children who rummage through
the old clothes stalls, calling to their
mothers for approval of shapeless skirts
and blouses, and the pensioners who
are popularly supposed, by some members
of Parliament, to visit Paddy's for false
teeth and spectacles.
The toothless pensioner, however, is
hard to find. Extensive enquiries revealed
no false teeth for sale it could have
been a bad week for them and a
woman selling spectacles seemed rather
insulted by the suggestion that her wares
might be sold to pensioners.
“It’s not only politicians who tell lies
about us,” she observed darkly, when
asked about her customers. It all sounded
intriguing, but as the spectacles were new,
smartly framed and probably around the
£3 to £4 mark, it did seem unlikely that
too"many destitute people would be in-
terested.
Italian and Greek people and pre-
sumably Maltese, if one judges by the
spitting signs are the main customers
in the fruit and vegetable stalls, which
operate on Fridays and Saturdays for
the public. Paddy’s, functioning only on
Fridays, is more of an international secret
society, a vast collection of determinedly
anonymous people united by a common
urge to get something for less than it
would cost elsewhere. To this day, people
hedge at mentioning even their home
suburbs, but are quite happy to give
their reasons for being there.
Not all stallholders operate as the tag-
end of a manufacturing or retail business.
It is possible to rent a stall simply to dis-
pose of odds and ends around the house.
“We've taken up to £BO a day,” said a
pleasant-faced man taking a rest at his
stall while his wife disposed of elderly
serviette rings, wicker baskets and cracked
plates. “But it depends how many dia-
mond rings my wife turns up.”
The goods were not entirely home-
grown, as it seemed he bought houses


on spec, fairly often, coming across such
riches as tape-recorders, antique cake
forks and candlesticks. A man of' many
parts, he also sold sheets of stamps which
could not be placed in his private col-
lection.
Collectors of Victoriana, and artisti-
cally minded young people, are well
aware of Paddy’s potential. “It’s a fabu-
lous mixture,” said James Murray, a
young man with a jawline beard who
designs sets for the Neutral Bay Music
Hall. He came fairly regularly to explore
the old wares stalls, partly for professional
reasons and partly for the private thrill of
adding to his collection of Victorian
bric-a-brac in his Redfern flat. ■
On this day Mr Murray was wearing
the pink-and-lilac checked shirt he had
bought, pristinely boxed, for 255. the pre-
vious Friday, a few yards away from the
curiosity stall where we were standing.
He was fondling a handsome antique
pendant watch. He had unwillingly paid
seven pounds for it at a loan shop, but
thought with perseverance the same
thing could be found at Paddy’s for less.
“Even if I don’t buy, I never think
the afternoon here is wasted,” he said.
“The whole place is fascinating, especially
for children. I’ve often seen little girls
carrying half-dead chooks around in
newspaper, pretending they're dolls. Oh,
just as many Australian ones as Italians,
or Greeks. I saw this little one a minute
ago, saying ‘lie back and go to sleep’ to a
black Australorp . . . although it’s best
not to think what happens when her pet
ends up in the soup. I suppose.”
Less maternally minded children prefer
tortoises, slithering around in the bottom
of a glass jar, for 12/6, to be fed on fresh
water weeds at threepence a piece, or
else the white mice, rats and angora
rabbits, also keenly priced.
No one is likely to admit to stewing
up angora bunnies, but people around the
fish stall have no reservations about order-
ing a pound or tw'o of calamari, or Bal-
main Bug, an unattractive-looking crusta-
cean which comes from Ballina. “They’re
catching on fast,” said the man at the
fish counter, indicating two Australian
men elbowing past an appreciative Japa-
nese woman who was taking home the
weekly squid. The Balmain Bug, he said,
was a bargain at 2/6 a pound. “Just like
lobster with a touch of crab.”
Opposite the Curiosity Stall is the stand
of Mr J. McKechnie, a Newcastle antique
dealer who comes down every Friday.
Mr McKechnie’s wares are a good deal
pricier than those across the laneway, and
this day included two copper preserving
pans (£2 each), a pair of three-feet-high
filigreed brass menorah candles at £2O
each, vintage car lights, an antique urn
and a wooden spinning wheel.
Mr McKechnie admitted that Sydney
dealers often took away a lot of his
treasures, but he wouldn't like to say
who or where. One imagines, though,
that an item like the candlesticks, moving
steadily eastward, will bring a lot more
than £4O before coming to rest on some
stately mantelpiece. As Mr McKechnie
says, it’s a good business or he wouldn’t
be coming every week for 13 years.
Second hand dealers need a special
licence to make it easier should police
want to check for stolen goods. Food
dealers, who sell sausages, peanuts,
broken chocolates and fish, also need a
licence.
Rooks start at 9d., with titles ranging
from “Cry The Lonely Flesh” to Graham
Greene’s “England Made Me”. Dearer by
a few pennies are “Downbeat Magazine”
(August 1962) and the “Boys’ Champion
Annual”. The stallholder here is a nice
little old lady whose sister runs a similar
shop at Kingsford, doing a roaring trade
with University students. Where do these
books come from? “Everywhere, love.
You’d be surprised.”
“You get all sorts here, love, even
doctors’ wives from Rose Bay,” said a
woman selling ribbons and laces. Some of
them, she said, had chauffeurs waiting
outside, but Market officials believe this
practice died out after the war.
Spontaneous Congress
Manifestation in the Albert Hall
By JOHN THURSTON
London received its first public
warning when BBC Television’s
“Tonight” programme, in its tire-
less search for the banally unusual, dis-
covered that the city had an accredited
beat poet on its hands. The outcome was
that one placid summer night viewers
suddenly found their screens filled by a
hairy but gentle man named Allen Gins-
berg.
In an introduction that embodied
every cliche and every condescending
generalisation ever coined about beat and
the avant-garde movement in poetry,
Kenneth Allsopp spoke of Ginsberg as
the author of “Howl”, a poem that had
performed the startling feat of making
itself the centre of an obscenity action.
Allsopp’s tone of voice made it clear that
for him and, by logical extension, for
his viewers, this was not the way for
poetry to behave.
Ginsberg, unruffled by his host’s un-
provoked peevishness, continued to sit,
a benign smile appearing between
his shoulder-length hair and chest-length
beard. Why was he appearing on tele-
vision? To let everybody know that
there was going to be a “manifestation”,
in the form of a large-scale poetry-read-
ing in the Albert Hall the following
Friday; by “apparent chance” many
well-known poets were in London at
the time, and a reading seemed the
appropriate way to mark this “spon-
taneous congress”. What would the
reading achieve? Apart from giving
poets and public the chance to tackle
each other, said Ginsberg, he and his
colleagues were simply “trying to put a
little love into the atmosphere”.
Ginsberg then produced a pair of
finger-cymbals and, with their help,
began intoning a brief, repeated pattern
of strange sounds. What was that, asked
the querulous Mr Allsopp; some device
to demonstrate just how way-out one
could be? Nothing of the kind, replied
the ever-mild Ginsberg; it was simply
that he was nervous on television and
the chanting of Tibetan mantras made
him feel more at peace.
The Albert Hall is a vast cylindrical
building in which the cheapest seats are
some 150 feet above floor-level. In a
clear space in the centre was a tiny
rostrum surrounded by flowers, assorted
poets, and bottles of Beaujolais which
were freely passed throughout the night.
Master of ceremonies before the crowd
of about 1500 was Alexancjer Trocchi,
author of “Young Adam” and “Cain’s
Book”, who introduced the first reader,
Simon Vinkenoog. The young, blond
Dutchman immediately set one of the
evening’s main themes with few
passionate generalisations about Vietnam
and closed with a rather spectacular
piece which required him to move about
the rostrum like a hovering hawk, while
shouting the word “Yes!” some 30 times.
Vinkenoog was followed by Mike
Horovitz and Pete Brown, both English
and both determined to get as much fun
out of things as possible. Their poems
were for the most part brief, inconse-
quential and funny, as were those of the
next reader, Anselm Hollo, a bearded,
genial London-based Finn. Hollo read
a few short pieces and then paused to
explain that he had learned an important
lesson from his 24-year-old daughter:
why write a poem when jumping up and
down expresses perfectly what you feel?
He proceeded to jump briefly about the
rostrum and then withdrew, grinning
broadly and obviously pleased with him-
self and the audience. He continued to


look happy all night, in pleasant contrast
with some of his more desperate
associates who, what with Vietnam and
the Bomb, seemed to be treating the
occasion as a kind of poet’s last supper.
Again Trocchi stepped to the micro-
phone, this time to call on one of the
evening’s main attractions: Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, foundation member of the
beat literary movement and fearless
owner of San Francisco’s City Lights
Publishing House. For the first time
someone had the audience completely
under control, and Ferlinghetti made the
most of it, pressing home his mystical,
pacifist ideas with power and ringing
conviction; all this to the tune of hooting
encouragement from Ginsberg, who lay
on the floor beside the rostrum.
After the first break a tape was played
of William Burroughs reading an extract
from one of his more conventional pieces.
Listening to the lazy Southern voice and
to the simple (and rather pointless) story
it told of a man sitting on a porch roll-
ing a cigarette, it was hard to believe
that this was the writer whose books
deal rather monotonously in masturba-
tion and aerial sex and who has been
accused of bringing the novel to the
point of total disintegration. Trocchi
apologised for the quality of the tape;
it was not representative of Burroughs’
best work, he said. It certainly wasn’t
typical.
The rostrum was vacant for a moment,
then, at Trocchi’s behest, Ginsberg took
the floor. Here is a giant of a man
whose poetry can die ingloriously on
the printed page, and yet take on great
force and authority when he speaks it
himself. Quietly, he dedicated his read-
ing to Andrei Voznesensky, sitting some
ten feet away, and then, hands scooping
and slicing, eyes flashing behind his
owlish, schoolboy glasses, he stormed
about the tiny platform, demanding an
end to war and hatred, promising almost
as a matter of personal guarantee a
better world for those who had the
courage to help make it. He had little
patience with interjections or applause
alike, simply overriding them with the
power of his voice.
He concluded abruptly. Neither
Trocchi nor anybody else seemed to
know what was to happen next, and
people began to leave.
Trocchi pushed back to the micro-
phone as a couple of dozen people con-
verged on it. Shouts of “Voznesensky”
arose, at which the young poet promptly
got up and left. Trocchi looked around
at the assembled poets and hangers-on
and saw Ginsberg once more sprawled
happily on the floor, finger-cymbals at
the ready; so he simply said, “That’s
all, goodnight,” and switched off the
microphone. Ginsberg began intoning.
Harold Blair Today
From " Macushla ” to “Uncle Tom’s Cabin ”
By J. E. MURPHY
Harold Blair led me from his
Harold Blair Australian Aboriginal
Market Centre, in one of the
Melbourne Southern Cross Hotel’s
arcades, to the hotel’s centre courtyard,
studded with fountains and modern
sculpture. His executive-type tailoring
seemed incongruous against the back-
ground of primitive art and objects. He
pointed to the courtyard.
“Every year several thousands of
overseas visitors leave with the com-
plaint that they have neither sighted one
Australian Aboriginal nor seen an
exhibition of boomerang throwing,” he
said. “These are the tourists whose
itineraries do not cover a visit to the
back country. I’m fairly well advanced
with negotiations to arrange for a more-
or-less continuous display of boomerang-
throwing and fire-making right in this
courtyard. If this is publicised in the
right places, more overseas visitors will
come here and, I hope, be interested in
what I have on display.”
This month Blair begins a Queensland
tour in “The Uncle Tom Bellowdrama,”
a burlesque of Harriet Beecher Stowe's
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin”. During a season
which opens at the Rialto Theatre, West
End, Brisbane, on July 5, Blair plays
Uncle Tom, a perfectly straight part.
The other actors play in melodramatic
style. The play, with Blair in the lead,
ran for eight months in Melbourne in
1962.
After inspecting the shop we adjourned
to a coffee lounge where I heard the
girl on an adjacent stool say to her
friend, “That’s the Ambassador from
Ceylon,” as she indicated Blair. But
Harold Blair did not appear to have
heard the remark.
“I admit I’ve always been something
of a dreamer,” he said, “but I think a
few of my dreams are coming near to
fulfilment. My backers in the shop and I
allot a sizeable amount of all
profits to the advancement of the Aus-
tralian Aborigines. The establishment of
the John Lloyd Scholarship is one im-
mediate project. This will guarantee a
chance for some Aborigines. I mean a
guaranteed opportunity of the sort which
came my way as a result of pure chance
and the interest of some very splendid
people. John Lloyd, after whom the
scholarships will be named, was among
those people. Marjorie Lawrence, Mar-
garet Sutherland, Clive Carey, and Irene
Webb, who taught me elocution, and
the teachers at Merton Hall, who took
time at night to educate me. are also on
the long list. Fancy an illiterate black-
fellow from Barambah Settlement in
Queensland learning the three Rs at one
of Melbourne’s most exclusive girls’
schools!”
Blair was clearly back in his personal
dream-time. “And they certainly all had
a hard row to hoe with me,” he went
on. “I don’t recall much about my
parents. I was born in 1926. I remember
boyhood days at Barambah. I really
grew up in Ipswich, but soon shifted to
Bundaberg to work in the cane. After
learning to drive tractors, I was shifted
to the Fairymead Mill’s plantation at
Childers. I could not write at all, and
my reading was limited to the ‘Miracle’
and the ‘Oracle’, parts of which I was
able to get only because they were
accompanied by pictures.
“The Childers canecutters were re-
sponsible for my first appearance on the
concert platform,” he went on. “They
used strong-arm tactics to arrange it at
the St Patrick’s night concert in the
Childers Town Hall in 1945. Just before
the start of the concert the cutters sur-
prised both the parish priest and me
by telling us both that I would render
several items. Brushing aside the priest’s
protests that the programme had already
been drawn up, they pushed me on stage.
When I had recovered from stagefright,
I brought the house down with ‘When

TOP PRIZE
WINNER FOR
TWELVE YEARS
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling.
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including Gold and
Silver Medals, Championships and Cups
throughout Australia and in Europe.
Last year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine Study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green - .bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and amber glass keeps
Out the light while the wine is aging.
* It is one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100% from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

Irish Eyes Are Smiling’ and ‘Macushla*.
I didn’t choose the numbers because it
was St Patrick’s night. They were the
only songs I knew!
“This performance brought me into
contact again with Harry Green, a rail-
way worker from Ipswich, who was one
of my earliest and most loyal sponsors.
Harry suggested" that I should learn to
sing and then enter an Amateur Hour
radio contest, and perhaps become an
artist of Richard Crooks’ calibre. I
assured him that I already knew how
to sing and, at the moment, was a hell
of a lot better than Richard Crooks.
“After listening long enough to Harry
Green, I entered and won the Australian
Radio Amateur Hour contest. I was then
invited to present Marjorie Lawrence
with a bouquet at her concert at the
Brisbane City Hall. Marjorie invited me
to sing. I obliged with ‘When Irish Eyes
Are Smiling’ and ‘Macushla’.”
A group of Brisbane businessmen then
provided the finance for a trip by Green
and his protege to seek an audition at
the Sydney Conservatorium. Here the
verdict was that Blair’s illiteracy pre-
cluded any chance of success in a sing-
ing career at that stage. Blair and Green
then caught a fruit-train from Sydney
to Melbourne. Blair recalls that they
rode in the guard's van. To the best of
his recollection they paid their fares.
Their arrival in Melbourne coincided
with a trade union congress, to which
Blair sang, again drawing on his rather
restricted repertoire. The Press notices
attracted the attention of composer Mar-
garet Sutherland. An audition at the
Melbourne Conservatorium followed.
At the conservatorium, Blair met and
married Dorothy Eden, when they were
both training under Madame Catherine
Wheeler. They now have a nine-year-old
daughter, Nerida.
Harold Blair remembers all his bene-
factors, particularly John Lloyd. “When
funds were low, John took time off to
organise a concert tour, which took in
all States except Western Australia. The
tour was a success and raised about
£2500 in all. But it was not enough.
And when Todd Duncan’s suggestion
that I visit the United States came I paid
my own fare.”
The American tour, which included
recitals in Washington, climaxed in a
triumphal capacity house at the New
York- Town Hall. Back in Australia,
concert tours with the ABC, with Henri
Penn as accompanist, took in all States.
Then Blair suddenly quit as an artist in
his own right. Today, his concerts are
restricted to those organised to raise
funds for the “Harold Blair Aboriginal
Children's Holiday Project”, which
annually brings Aboriginal children from
all States to Victoria.

OVERSEAS
The Colonel Likes Castro
Who was using whom?
By WILLIAM MILLINSHIP
Ironically, the new man in command
in Algiers, Colonel Houari Boume-
dienne, is the man who put President
Ben Bella in power three years ago. In
those days it was never quite clear who
was using whom. But Colonel Boume-
dienne, despite repeated reports of
quarrels and rumors of an army coup,
stayed in the background. He rarely
spoke in public, and allowed Ben Bella
to capture all the limelight.
While crushing opposition from other
veteran leaders of the war of indepen-
dence. the two men needed each other.
When President Ben Bella travelled
abroad and in the Algerian provinces,
he left Colonel Boumedienne in charge.
Their alliance was the one permanent
feature in the shifting pattern of Algerian
politics since independence in 1962.
Colonel Boumedienne, aged 39, is tall
and thin, with a mop of fair hair and a
reddish moustache. He has none of Ben
Bella’s charm and magnetism. His face
is thin and heavily lined with sunken
cheeks, and he seems to be constantly
brooding. But, while silent in public,
he is said to have been vehement, im-
patient and violent in his private clashes
with the Algerian leadership before and
after independence.
He is a revolutionary intellectual, both
an admirer of Fidel Castro and a fervent
Muslim. He was born in eastern Algeria,
and studied at religious Muslim univer-
sities in Tunis and Cairo. He joined the
Algerian Liberation Army in 1955, and,
within two years, was in command of the
rebel operations against the French in
the Oran region.
He began his climb to power when he
took over command of the Algerian
army based in Tunisia. He equipped it
with modern weapons and drilled it in
his own political theories. He believes
that the “peasant army” should be the
spearhead of the revolution. He taught
his troops that they should carry a rifle
on one shoulder and a pick-axe on the
other.
When Algeria became independent,
Colonel Boumedienne was in control of
a disciplined, well-armed force, while
the guerrilla army in Algeria itself was
divided into a patchwork of small
baronies. On the eve of independence
day, Colonel Boumedienne, who had
bitterly attacked the peace agreements
with France, rebelled against the Algerian
Provisional Government and put his
army at the disposal of Ben Bella in the
struggle for power that followed.
Colonel Boumedienne supported Ben
Bella in the gradual elimination of all
the veteran leaders of the 1954 rising
against France. He was not a popular
figure himself and needed Ben Bella’s
personal prestige in the long struggle
against the other “historic chiefs” who
were driven into hiding and exile or
arrested. Organised opposition to the
regime collapsed with the arrest last year
of Ait Ahmed, who had launched an
armed revolt in the hills of Kabylia.
Ben Bella and Boumedienne agreed
that the Algerian revolution was essen-
tially rural and had to be based on a
sweeping land reform. But they differed
over the army’s role. Ben Bella, as both
president and secretary of the single
political party, tried to subordinate the
army to the State.
He has failed when he was just about
to take the centre of the international
stage with a double diplomatic success,
first as host to the Afro-Asian conference,
second as the guest of General de Gaulle.
This ex-French army sergeant was ex-
pected shortly to make a semi-state visit
to the country where he had spent five
years in prison.
His fall will not necessarily bring any
spectacular shift in Algerian foreign
policy. Both Ben Bella and Colonel
Boumedienne have been on good per-
sonal terms with President Nasser. And
the new man will have no particular
reason to destroy the good relations with
France. Three years after independence,
the Algerian economy is still feeble and
heavily dependent on French aid and
trade, (ofns)
Taking It Quietly
Moscow’s placid new leadership
By EDWARD CRANKSHAW
Marshal Tito’s welcome in Moscow
is the clearest possible indication
of Russia’s determination to go
her own way undeterred by Chinese
blackmail. Good relations between Yugo-
slavia and the Soviet Union stand, as
nothing else, for bad relations between
China and the Soviet Union.
In this and in other ways the Soviet
leadership has chosen to demonstrate its
apparent unconcern at the possibility of
further losses to the Chinese cause at
the very moment when the war in Viet-
nam is taking a still uglier turn. Ameri-
can intervention in Vietnam has already
long passed the stage at which many
Western politicians and commentators,
and many East European Communists,
too, were convinced that Russia would
have to react sharply if only to retain
her authority over those Communist
Parties (still the great majority) not com-
mitted to China.
Instead, she has effectively done
nothing. She has put up with the abuse
of the Chinese and their allies (the latest
and the most violent attack to date has
just come from the Japanese Communist
Party) with only an occasional sharp
word in reply. She has watched the
steady deployment of American force in
Vietnam with a passivity which, a few
years ago, would have been inconceiv-
able. After four months of this the only
conclusion to be drawn is. that the new
leadership in Russia has its own reasons
for preferring things to remain as they
are.
But what is this new leadership? Mos-
cow’s relative silence about world affairs,

We did! The travel agent started it by explaining it wouldn't cost a penny
more to stop-over in Singapore, on our way to Europe. On those terms who
would miss the chance to go on a voyage of discovery!
So we came to Singapore. The friendly, cosmopolitan people welcomed us
to their fascinating country and we were set fair to uncover an array of
spectacle and excitement that gave real meaning to the saying—‘You see
more of the Orient in Singapore.’ Take a glimpse at this magical island
with us and you too will be taking the first steps towards discovering wonder-
ful Singapore.
SIGHTSEEING Why see the world when
there’s Singapore? See the rest of the world by all means —
but don’t miss Singapore! Where else do three great races present the
many faces of their culture, their pageantry and their costume and their
customs. Only on this fabulous Island can you see the Festival of lights—
The Mooncake Festival —The Chinese New Year celebrations—The Thaipusam
devotions and the Malay pageant of Hari Raya Puasa. Only in Singapore
can you, in one day, visit the Muslim Mosques —the Indian and the Chinese
temples—the Tiger Balm Gardens and the House of Jade.
Even whilst you are marvelling at this many splendoured spectacle, you
thread your way through a tapestry of costume and colour that excites your

silK}dpo|*y
about Communist Party affairs, about
home affairs, too, embraces the deepest
possible silence about the real composi-
tion of the failing body of the Soviet
Union. Many of Khrushchev’s men have
been dropped, but on the whole quietly
and without fuss. The men who have
taken over their appointments have not
been publicised. Messrs Brezhnev and
Kosygin have studiously refrained, or
been restrained, from presenting them-
selves as national leaders.
To all appearances Mr Kosygin is
behaving like a constitutional Prime
Minister, but one possessing less per-
sonal powers than a modern British
Prime Minister. Domestically, economic
developments have been moving steadily
along the lines he might have been
expected to encourage—more consumer
goods, more prosperity, more flexibility.
Mr Brezhnev has not presented him-
self as a personality at all. There is no
reason to believe that he has had to
pretend very hard about this, and the
rumors circulating in Moscow for some
time now. that he will soon be replaced
as First Secretary of the party by a man
with a little more dynamism and natural
authority, are probably well founded.
Yet there is no sign at all of the sort
of struggle that went on in the months
after Stalin’s death and which ended in
the triumphant Khrushchev and the ruin
of his closest colleagues.
In a word, Russia, with her tradition
of autocracy, has for nine months been
without a leader with the power of a
Johnson or a de Gaulle; and she seems
determined not only to continue with
this experiment but to broaden it. The
latest issue of “Party Life” has an
extremely important article by its editor-
in-chief, Mr Bugayev, a member of the
central auditing commission of the
Soviet Communist Party, which declared
categorically that there can no longer
be any question of any single country
assuming responsibility for the central
leadership of the Communist movement.
“In present-day conditions there exists
no centre (nor several centres) for the
leadership of the International Com-
munist Movement. Attempts to revive
the forms of relations between parties
which were justified in earlier stages }f
development may produce negative con-
sequences and fetter the initiative of
parties which are themselves capable of
solving the problems facing their
countries.”
This is making a virtue of necessity
with a vengeance. But it is also very
much a wind of change. And under the
new Soviet leadership, which is not a
leadership as hitherto understood, change
is growing steadily through the economic
life of the Soviet Union, (ofns)

An Australian Bomb?
An Indo-Pacific Nuclear Force
By A. L. BURNS
On June 18 British Labor’s former
Foreign Secretary, Mr Patrick
Gordon Walker, proposed, accord-
ing to the cables, “an international
nuclear force east of Suez” for “non-
nuclear powers around the Indian and
Pacific Oceans”, including India and
Japan. This would secure them against
Chinese nuclear threats, and assuage
their needs to make their own nuclears.
Gordon Walker’s proposal was only the
latest of several feelers put out by the
Wilson Government about “nuclear
guarantees” which would fill out the
British role east of Suez. (An Indo-
Pacific Nuclear Force —IPNF—is just
one of several possible ways to make
a nuclear guarantee concrete.) Why has
Canberra as yet made no public response
to those feelers? Why does Mr B. A.
Santamaria ignore them in The Bulle-
tin symposium on “An Australian
Bomb?” (B„ June 19)?
Response from Australia and New
Zealand to Britain’s counter - nuclear
diplomacy could be the first steps toward
coping with our increasing nuclear
problems of the next 15 years. They
would foreclose very few possibilities
neither the most cheerful, a halt to
nuclear dispersal that nevertheless would
not make us all non-nuclear dependencies
of a great-power condominium; nor the
grimmer, e.g., our buying a “packaged”
strategic deterrent from one or another
of our nuclear friends, or, say, an Anglo-
Australasian ICBM force in the late
19705. Australia and the United King-
dom, as Professor E. W. Titterton (in
the same issue) points out, have co-
operated to develop British nuclears and
missiles in this country, almost since
the beginning of Britain’s nuclear pro-
gramme. Should it turn out that we
must have a finger on some nuclear
trigger, surely our money would be
better spent to procure a system which
is strategic as well as tactical, and which
could give pause not only to Communist
China but to the USSR as well rather
than to develop one that, however much
our own, could be for many years only
small, vulnerable, and of local range.
Even those alarmed by a nuclearised
China find it hard to see why Australia
should have to worry about deterring
Russia. That, admittedly, is a contingent
and rather remote danger, but a danger
it is. The USA and the USSR will avoid,
above all, any large-scale nuclear strikes
against each other. But Russia can use
nuclear hostages allied to or dependent
upon the USA as levers on the USA
itself. If one day, in the course of a
struggle against China in which Australia
w r as deeply implicated along with the
Americans, the latter should initiate
nuclear warfare against China, it is at
least a possibility that, despite a certain
equanimity in Moscow at the defeat and
destruction of Chinese power, the Krem-
lin might consider that Russia’s prestige
as one of the two nuclear super-powers
required her to “mete out justice against
the aggressor bloc” by nuclear reprisals
upon an Australia that had no finger
near any nuclear trigger which could
damage Russia itself.
An IPNF sponsored by the United
Kingdom (which through her own strike-
forCe can defy nuclear blackmailing
from Russia) would be fairly - to-
thoroughlv credible against China, and
should also have some dissuasive in-
fluence on the USSR itself. Later on,
when all independent national nuclear
forces have H-bombs with ICBM
delivery, a multi-national nuclear guaran-
tee like the IPNF would probably need
to be shared out in independent pack-
ages to its former members. Meanwhile,
when manned bombers still provide a
feasible delivery system, “the possibility
of transporting nuclear weapons to this
country in ... an emergency, to serve
either as defence or deterrent”, need
not be, as Mr Santamaria charges,
“remote”.
Both Chinese nuclear blackmail
to gain control of South-East Asia
or of Australasia, and an all-out war in
the Northern Hemisphere, are in the
nature of them events of which the world
is bound to receive at least a few days’
premonition long enough for major
nuclear powers to hand over stockpiles
of droppable nuclears to an ally on
prior agreement. Once those bombs have
passed from, say, English to Australian
sovereign control, there can be no point
in China’s hitting or threatening United
Kingdom citizens or interests. Though
existing nuclear powers have reason to
resist peace-time nuclear dispersal, they
would have, on the verge of nuclear war
between China and an ally, urgent
reasons for getting rid, to the ally, of a
force that would deter China.
Lastly, a Commonwealth initiative to
forefend nuclear dispersal and provide
nuclear guarantees in Indo-Pacifica need
not, at the present time, disturb the USA,
which now has a strong interest in
Britain’s maintaining an east-of-Suez
position. Australasia has always had
that interest: now we can further it.

The Biological Time-Bomb
By choosing the sex of unborn children , storing human seed ,
and artificial inovulation , physiologists will soon be able to
intervene at almost any point in the reproductive process.
By GORDON RATTRAY TAYLOR
Let me sketch some of the advances
which are about to spring from our
new understanding of the physi-
ology of reproduction. Three which will
quite certainly create controversy in the
lifetime of people now living are:
1. The power to choose the sex of
your children.
2. Indefinite storage of human seed.
3. Artificial inovulation (the female
equivalent of A. 1.).
Of the three developments tn the re-
productive process, the most imminent
is the second: indeed, it is already here.
Last year, the first United States babies
to be born from stored human spermato-
zoa successfully entered the world in a
suburb of Philadelphia. On a recent visit
to America I spoke at some length to
Dr W. H. Perloff, the physician in
charge. The procedure is to mix the
semen with a very simple substance
glycerol and to lower the temperature
to minus 196 deg. centigrade with the
aid of liquid nitrogen: the method was
evolved by Dr H. Sherman of Little
Rock, Arkansas. Perloff used seed
which had been in store for periods up
to one year, but Sherman has keDt
human sperm in storage for five years,
up to date, with little visible sign of
deterioration.
Perloff was quick to point out that
this technique enables sub-fertile hus-
bands to achieve paternity, since their
seed can be pooled and concentrated
over a period until it is capable cf
effecting conception. However, the
possibility on which the American Gov-
ernment no doubt has its eye is that
banks of human seed can be created
and stored under heavy shielding, so
that it will remain genetically unaffected
by the heavy radiation expected to be
released in the event of a nuclear war.
Between these two extremes lies a
massive third possibility about which
Perloff, like many others, is unwilling
to commit himself. It brings into the
realm of practicality the dreams of
eugenists. Before now, to argue that
we should breed only from the healthiest
and most capable stock was academic.
Most people choose their marital partners
for reasons which have nothing to do
with eugenics. And even the convinced
eugenist may find it difficult to find and
win the partner he or she regards as
suitable. But once the choice of partner
and the choice of parent can be separated,
the situation becomes quite different.
It does not require too great a stretch
of imagination to visualise what might
happen, at least in a few cases, if let
us suppose in Russia the seed of a
public hero such as Gagarin were to be
made available. And I don’t think it
is unwarranted sensationalism to visualise
let us suppose in America—a “pop
singer” or television star finding he could
add to his earnings in this way.
Naturally, this would not occur at first.
But in 20 years or so, when the contro-
versy has lost its sting, things might
change, as has happened in so many
other areas.
More realistically, perhaps, women
whose husbands are exposed to risk will
sometimes want to retain a supply of
stored sperm so that they can continue
to bear his children. I understand that
a number of requests of this character
were received from American women
whose husbands were sent to fight in
the Korean War.
The possibility of deciding in advance
what sex one’s children are to be arises
as a consequence of sperm-storage and
artificial insemination. The sex of a
child is determined by the sperm, which
carries genetic material specific for one
sex or the other. There are thus two
kinds of sperm, and it is only a matter
of time before a way is found of ex-
ploiting this difference so as to separate
sperm with the male-potentiality from
those with the female-potentiality.
In Eastern countries the desire for
sons rather than daughters is often
strong, and authoritarian governments
may be willing to feed this desire,
especially when they need fighting men.
Such a policy, of course, leads in time
to a fall in population, since fewer
women means fewer babies born. It may
be, therefore, that selection of sex will be
used to halt the expansion of population
in Eastern countries, while shifting the
sex-ratio in favor of males who can work
or fight.
Eggs
JDut it is artificial inovulation which is
likeliest to have the most immediate
impact in our own society.
It is now a commonplace to remove
eggs from the body cavity of a rabbit
or a sheep and to implant them in the
uterus of another animal of the same
species. I recently saw a white doe
rabbit surrounded by seven black “off-
spring” which she seemed to accept
quite calmly, despite their unexpected
color. They had been fostered in her
uterus and born through her uterine
canal, but originated from eggs taken
from a black rabbit. This technique is
already being used by farmers because
it enables an especially satisfactory ewe
to give birth to far more offspring than
she could expect to bear herself. The
injection of a hormone, progesterone,
causes the ewe to produce an unusually
large number of eggs.
Odder still, eggs from a prize British
ewe have been implanted in the uterus
of a rabbit, and the rabbit flown across
the Atlantic, after which the eggs were
removed and implanted in American
ewes, which in due course gave birth

to “English” progeny. Similar experi-
ments have been performed between
Britain and South Africa. No one, as
far as I know, has yet had the temerity
to apply such procedures to human
beings, but there is not the slightest
reason to suppose that they would not
work just as effectively in man as in
animals. They are unlikely to become
widely popular, since the eggs must be
obtained by surgical intervention. (And
at present they must also be implanted
in the recipient by surgical methods:
merely blowing them into the uterus
does not seem to work, but it is thought
that this difficulty may be overcome.)
Nevertheless, an infertile woman
whose infertility is due to failure to
produce viable eggs, and not to a uterine
defect, could by this means experience
the cycle of pregnancy and childbirth.
Many women feel a strong desire for
this experience and find adoption an
inadequate solution. They would scarcely
blench at a minor operation—much less
serious than Caesarean section to
achieve it.
“Brave New World'”
fjpHE notion that human embryos might
A be brought to term in artificial condi-
tions caused an incredulous stir when it
W'as first propounded in Aldous Huxley’s
book, “Brave New World”, originally
published in 1932. Thirty years later
this feat has not yet been performed,
but there has been considerable progress
towards it. Only last year, Dr D. A. T.
New succeeded at Cambridge in bringing
mouse-embryos to the stage at which the
heart begins to beat fn “test-tube” con-
ditions.
Similar experiments made with human
embryos have been conducted in Italy
by Dr Petrucci, Of Bologna. The
Pope was reported to have forbidden
further experiments of the sort. Attack-
ing from the other end. Professor P. V.
Anokhin in Russia and Dr J. C. Cal-
laghan in Canada have tried to emulate
the last phases of uterine life, using an
artificial placenta. Professor Anokhin
claims to have brought embryos success-
fully to term by this means.
Taken in conjunction, these lines of
work bring us alarmingly near the
State Hatcheries of Huxley’s imagina-
tion. Many scientists are confident that
the trick will have been turned by the
end of the century. In view of what we
now know about the importance of a
satisfactory emotional relationship be-
tween child and mother, it w'ould seem
that any child produced this way would
certainly have to be equipped w ; ith foster
parents.
In addition to these developments,
W'hich are upon us, one can see a fresh
group of problems arising very soon
and certainly within the next 20 years.
Two interconnected advances to watch
are:
1. Organ transplantation.
2. Preservation by deep freezing.
The attempts of surgeons to transplant
kidneys into people suffering from kidney
disease have made headlines recently.
And three years ago, when an American
boy, Ev Knowles, had an arm completely
severed, it was successfully sewn back
on. This operation was subsequently re-
peated in other cases quite successfully.
The fact is, the purely surgical problems
of organ transplantation are, with one
important qualification, substantially
overcome. Working on dogs and other
animals, American and Russian surgeons
have removed and replaced lungs,
stomach, liver and even the heart. The
qualification concerns the nerves, which
have limited powers of regeneration.
The idea of freezing not merely
organs but whole creatures has long been
a theme of science fiction. In practice
it is not so easy. But here, too, progress
is being made. The Russians seem to
be farthest ahead, and Professor Lap-
chinsky at the Organ Transplantation
Laboratory in Moscow shows visitors
rows of refrigerating cabinets containing
limbs and organs of every kind, both
animal and human, while Professor
Demikhov has mastered many of the
surgical problems.
In a broadcast before his death, the
late Professor Haldane said: “My wife
and I have willed our bodies for dis-
section after our deaths, but I would
much rather that someone continued to
walk around on my legs.” Before long,
anyone who feels this way will be able,
provided he dies while in reasonable
general health, to rest assured that all
his main organs will continue to serve
other people for many years.
Again, one can foresee that in time
of war it might be very convenient to
a ruthless Government to reconstitute
effective soldiers from the fragments of
damaged ones, just as damaged trucks
and tanks were “cannibalised” during the
Second World War.
No outline of the future impact of
biology would be complete without a
reference to the question of biological
warfare. Apart from direct methods of
killing or incapacitating, biological war
can be waged against cattle and crops,
and perhaps without the nation which is
being attacked realising that aggression
is occurring. All they may observe is
a series of disastrous harvests, or
epidemics of animal or human disease.
More subtly still, they might suffer a pro-
gressive loss of drive and vitality, such
as attends some deficiency diseases,
without any clinically recognisable illness.
As the astronomer Fred Hoyle said to
me recently: “Before long it will
be the medical establishments which will
be surrounded by barbed wire, and it
will be the biologists rather than the
physicists who will be subjected to the
most intensive loyalty checks.”
It is no good shutting our eyes to the
kind of developments I have outlined.
Better to look squarely at them now, so
that we can evolve rational policies,
based upon an informed public opinion,
for coping with them.

visit the 3£¥S Business Communications Centre
You get a whole new approach to paper-work
from the 3M Business Communications people.
They will suggest new methods and systems
that save man-hours and reduce office over-
heads. More important, they’ll design them so
your business won’t outgrow them.
When a 3M Business Communications Con-
sultant meets you, he won’t talk much. He
wants you to! About the paper-work you have
to tackle. Because equipping an office is like
measuring someone for a suit—the product
must fit the individual’s need.
But he will ask questions . . . what type of
paper-work do you have? Correspondence?
Reports? Financial records? Internal forms?
Which departments handle the most paper-
work?
Then he assesses how and where 3M’s Systems
and Copying Products can save typing and
clerical effort, and speed the paper-work flow
throughout your organisation.
But first he’ll invite you to the 3M Business
Communications Centre, to see for yourself the
3M range of machines and papers. But why

Letters to the Editor
The Bomb
SIR. Can we, for once, stop acting
like sage philosophers and stupid
politicians and get down to business?
Most of us believe (those that don’t,
don’t matter) that possession of the
bomb by separate powders of opposed
ideology has prevented a third world
war. There is no argument as to
whether or not Australia should have
the bomb (8., June 19) to discourage
aggression, and if our alliance with the
US means anything, let us negotiate to
buy these weapons from the admitted
surplus production that is embarrassing
our American friends. Could anything
be more ludicrous than to waste our
nation’s money and effort to set up such
a local manufacturing industry?
E. Goss
St Ives (NSW).
The Noble American
SIR. Some weeks ago you ran an
editorial on the “noble” Americans in
Vietnam. The Australian Press must
be printing different stories from those
appearing here, for to us (as well as
to such oddly assorted Americans as
Senator Morse and Dr Spock) the
American course in Vietnam appears
anything but noble. There are three
separate reasons why we should not
support American action in Vietnam.
The first is that it is ignoble, undemo-
cratic and immoral. The second is that
we, unlike the Americans and British are
stuck in Asia. If we are to live in peace
with our neighbors we must avoid being
labelled neo-colonialist. This means that
we must stay out of other people’s
quarrels, particularly those concerned
with spheres of interest and other
manoeuvres of power politics; we must
revise our immigration laws, and we
must increase our aid, not our arms. The
third reason —and a compelling one —is
that the Americans are bound to lose—
unless the war escalates to World War
111, in which case we all lose. The fol-
lowing facts point to the defeat of the
Americans: (1) The French, with a much
greater commitment, were defeated; (2)
the air-power on which the Americans
had pinned their hopes has completely'
failed in its use against both the Vietcong
and North Vietnam; (3) it is the war of
the minds that is really important, as
everyone admits—the Vietcong tech-
niques are far better attuned to this than
are those of the Americans. Instead of
spraying villages with napalm or shelling
schoolhouses, they shoot the tax-collector
and put his head on a pole.
The best we can hope for is a Com-
munist Vietnam relatively independent
of China. The domino theory is often
cited as a reason for not capitulating in
■ Vietnam. How meaningful is this theory
when the evidence is that the American
actions in Vietnam have contributed
greatly to the anti-American feeling in
both Indonesia and Cambodia?

Tom The Unknown
SIR. Who are the chemists who
would like to see “Tom the Cheap”
strung up? (8., June 19). We notice that
the early-to-bed, “fit-looking 50-year-old”
philanthropic Mr Tom Wardle is not
quoted as saying that chemists are after
his blood; presumably that is Terry
Padley’s interpretation of the position.
Apart from those in his home stamping
ground, Western Australia, “Tom the
Cheap” is unknowm to Australian
pharmacists generally, and I much doubt
whether Coles and Woolworths are suf-
fering from his depredations in the
eastern States.
G. HERVEY-TENNYSON

The Bandicoot
SIR. —I do not attack professional drama
critics who give a play of mine an
adverse review. A critic is paid to ex-
press an opinion on a play, and is entitled
to say what he likes or does not like.
The drama critics in Melbourne were at
the opening night of “Bandicoot on a
Burnt Ridge” I saw at least three of
them in the theatre. But how can Robin
Bailey (8., June 19) sneer at a play
which he hasn’t seen? He has not, to
my knowledge, read the script, and if he
has, he has read it without my permis-
sion. Perhaps imported actors who make
regular trips to Australia w'ould prefer
that we did not write, produce and act
in Australian plays? Because if this is
allowed to continue, we shall not have
any need for imported actors at all, shall
we?
MARIEN DREYER
Kings Cross (NSW).
How Many Jesuits?
SIR.—My thanks are due to Mr David
Storey for bringing to'notice (8., June
19) an error concerning the number of
Jesuit priests in the Australian Province.
The mishap occurred by an inadvertent
reference to the figures of the Arch-
diocese of Melbourne rather than to the
total number of Jesuit priests attached
to the Australian Province.

ANTARCTICA
...THE NEW
DOWN UNDER
There is an odd, rather elegant pen-
nant flying these days from the
headquarters of ANARE (the
Australian National Antarctic Research
Expeditions) in St Kilda Road, Mel-
bourne. A refreshing change from the
übiquitous penguin, it depicts a rare,
odd, and elegant creature, a leopard
seal couchant. Less than a thousand
Australians are entitled to wear a minia-
ture gilt replica denoting service in the
far south, at one or more of the five
scientific research stations which Aus-
tralia has maintained for varying periods
since 1948 in the most isolated, coldest,
windiest continent on earth, Antarctica,
or on its stormy satellite islands.
At present there are three such out-
posts: the oldest, on Macquarie Island,
in the howling fifties of the Tasman Sea,
manned by 17 men under that veteran
sub-Antarctican Bruce Ellwood; and at
Mawson and Wilkes, about 1300 miles
apart on the Antarctic mainland, another
50 men led, respectively, by Brian
Woinarski and John Lanyon. The bases
on Heard Island and at Davis are
deserted. The first made way for the
opening of Mawson, in 1954, and the
second was sealed off on January 25 this
year, a retrenchment coinciding with a
new venture, a replacement for Wilkes.
This will be built over the next four
years on a site about a mile and a half
from the old snow-drifted base originally
put up by the Americans for part of
their International Geophysical Year
programme in 1957, and made over to
Australia in 1959.
Australia’s work in a continent
approximately as large as Australia and
the United States combined is under
the aegis of the Department of External
Affairs. The Antarctic Division costs
rather less to run than the Audit Office of
the Prime Minister’s Department; both
rank at well under a million pounds each
per year, or a trifle more than a penny
in every £lO of Commonwealth revenue.
Several other authorities—the Bureau of
Mineral Resources, Geology and Geo-
physics, and the Division of National
Mapping (Department of National De-
velopment), the Commonwealth Bureau
of Meteorology and the lonospheric Pre-
diction Service (Department of the
Interior), CSIRO, and many university
departments have stakes in Antarctic
research and have contributed accord-
ingly. The adjectives used to describe the
ANARE pennant might be considered
equally applicable to the astonishing
work of the Antarctic Division, and per-
haps to its dynamic director, Dr Phillip
Law, whose enthusiasm has never
wavered, and who, incidentally, designed
the emblem.
Just now, he and his senior staff are
recruiting: endeavoring to sift several
hundred applicants for the 70 missions
offering in 1966. The criteria are know-
ledge of, and love for, the scientific or
technical task, sufficient sense of adven-
ture and curiosity to sustain more than
a year of loneliness and possible hard-
ship in the world’s most remote outposts,
and those qualities of unselfishness, toler-
ance and optimism which will enable
them to live peaceably with each other.
Law and his colleagues travel between
the capitals, interviewing radio men,
engineers, physicists, surveyors,
biologists, meteorologists, cooks, medical
officers, and many who aspire to the
onerous and lonely tasks of leadership.
It is not difficult to gauge a man’s
knowledge and skill; these may be
By JOHN BECHERVAISE
reckoned in degrees and objective facts.
Much more difficult is the evaluation of
the intangibles. Out of the applications
and the interviews, the recommendations,
the tests, • and the consultations, the
future teams will emerge. For a time
they will eye each other askance, and
undergo intensive specialist training.
Ultimately, they will be ‘signed on’. They
have mounted their barbed arrows.
Come what may, they must pursue their
courses: out on the little polar ships
with red hulls stronger than those of
the greatest liners; down through the
stormy seas and the pack-ice, to their
long, lonely, individual years in the noon
darkness and the midnight sun . . . until,
in the fullness of time, the little ships
will return for them.
The pattern of Australian polar re-
search and exploration, her experience,
her problems, and her satisfactions, are
part of a greater whole. The British,

the Americans, the Russians, the Japan-
ese, the French, the Belgians, South
Africans, Argentineans, Dutch, New
Zealanders, the Chileans all are there
at this moment, and co-operating on a
truly international venture that has been
successfully sustained for nearly a
decade. Once I imagined that the first
international language would be that of
the arts. I suppose, architecturally, any-
way, it has been so. But, where men
talk together through days and years,
over the immense, never-sleeping radio
network of Antarctica, the language is
that of mathematics and science. The
mathematics of the universe, and the
geophysical sciences of a single planet,
studies which no solitary nation may
pursue alone to a conclusion, are being
studied in the world’s most propitious
continental laboratory, Antarctica.
Here, most of the energies, visible
and invisible, that enfold our planet, are
concentrated by the earth’s magnetic
field, by the laws of gravity and thermo-
dynamics, and by the coriolis effects of
the spinning earth. Each year there is
a core of men amongst the mass of
applicants for positions in the world’s
expeditions the men volunteering to
return to Antarctica. For Australians,
the “old lags” make the gilt leopard the
more exclusive.
Yet at least they know what they are
in for: the days of opaque, howling
blizzard, when they will have to haul
themselves hand over hand along the
safety lines between the huts; the long
periods when routine observations will
pall, and one would give almost any
material thing in exchange for a few
more hours in “the pit”. To rise in
complete darkness, to a malicious wind
and a temperature of minus 20 or minus
30 degrees—so or 60 degrees F. below
freezing— to perform routine “skeds and
obs” is a real test of resolution. If they
are “field men”, they will recall immobile
days of furious drift, when their tents
or vehicles seemed the sole living cells
on a dead, cold planet; and moments
with theodolites or fuel-pumps, when
heavily gloved hands were as frustrating
as if they had been frozen. There will
be memories, inevitably, of bleak lone-
liness, when a party is overdue, or fails
to respond to signals; when someone is
sick; when a dog-team has come to the
literal end of its tether in deepening
drifts and has to be dug out; when an

businessman who had spent 4
weeks seeing all New Zealand
was asked to name the highlight.
’’Waitangi!” he said. "I want
to go back to Waitangi - for 6
weeks."
At Waitangi, sheltered
in the Bay of Islands (149 of
them) north of Auckland, is
the newest of New Zealand's
new-look international resorts.
There are do-nothing things to
do like loafing around the heated
pool over a beer or two, ambling
by foot, car or boat through a
charming, historic district. Or
get out on the blue waters to haul
in a swordfish, just as Zane Grey
did. Take a look at a superb
collection of Maori carvings;
golf on a course famous for its
hill-striding fairways. And when
you feel like a day out, you can
visit the calm green heart of
a Kauri Forest, or drive along
the Ninety Mile Beach. (In
the season, try digging for
toheroas.)

KALCOLOR
changing the
architectural scene
Kalcolor is more than just another
anodising process. It is a new method of
imparting to aluminium, colours that
are light fast to a degree never before
possible with conventional colour
anodising. No other architectural
anodic finish measures up to Kalcolor
aluminium. It provides greater uniformity
in the reproduction of colour and
superior resistance to corrosion and
abrasion. Kalcolor aluminium is available
in a range of classic architectural
colours exclusively from Comalco
and the sole licensed processor
Aluminium Anodisers Pty. Ltd.
The richness and beauty of Kalcolor
finishes are evident on Sydney's
new Lasalle Building.

den whiteout, and you are still airborne
in a shadowless world without dimension.
Yet all the desolate days will be over-
lain by memories of a crystal world,
clearer and cleaner than anywhere else
on earth, when the sea is a marble plain,
honey-flushed and slate-grey, and a
hundred icebergs are like immense
amethysts under a sun that never sets.
Visions will be focussed of the great
mountains of Antarctica, some, perhaps,
new-created for the first time in human
sight. And fragments of memories will
recur, of simple occasions with men
whom one has learned to respect, for
their skills and integrity, who will always
be there to mock most kinds of
solemnity.
Most Antarcticans will also recall the
special dimensions of time that exist
within the polar regions, that leaves
freedom so uncluttered, and makes any
kind of recreation entire. Most men
have time for reading and thinking, and
for any transportable or newly-found
hobbies. Everyone seems
to find a way to help in the
maintenance of the sta-
tion, or in improving its
amenities —in addition to
his rostered share of the chores—being
“slushy” and occasionally relieving the
cook.
It is just ten years since, from Robert
Dovers, I first took over the charge of
Mawson, on the Antarctic Continent •
almost directly south of Ceylon. It had
been founded a year earlier, while I was
on Heard Island. At that time, Aus-
tralia, having experienced several years
of vital experience in her sub-Antarctic
bases at Heard Island and at Mac-
quarie Island, was probably as well pre-
pared for the coming International
Geophysical Year as any other nation
as far as polar work went. Dovers drove
me out in a weasel ever the gleaming
ice to a height of about 2000 feet above
the sea, near the first major crevasse
belts, south of Mawson, beyond Mount
Henderson.
He waved a hand to the southward.
“Well, she’s yours, now!” he said. He
meant that our team had the chance to
carry on his southern explorations into
regions that had never been visited. That
year, the Australians were in fact alone
in the whole of Greater Antarctica
about five million square miles of ice-
cap. Their nearest neighbors were in
the stem of the Antarctic Peninsula that
extends up towards South America. As
every party since has done, we fulfilled
our scientific objectives, both at base
and in probing southward into the Prince
Charles Mountains. At the close of our
stay the great nations were mustering
to prepare their facilities for the IGY,
that successor of the “Polar Years” of
1882 and 1932, proposed by the Inter-
national Council of Scientific Unions
(ICSU). It was all still pretty tentative.
There was a year of maximum solar
activity swinging up (The International
Quiet Sun Year is now under way!)
For nine years, not only have the
nations co-operated to the utmost in
peaceful scientific research in Antarctica,
exchanging synoptic results in meteor-
ology and other disciplines, but they
have signed an Antarctic Treaty agreeing
to the “freezing” of all territorial claims
on the Continent, to the open scientific
enquiry of all nations, to the complete
ban on all military installations and the
testing of atomic weapons, and to the
pooling of all geophysical knowledge.
Much interest has been taken in
America’s atomic reactor at McMurdo.
This has a net output of 1500 kw
sufficient for all normal scientific and
domestic needs. The saving of fuel
space in shipping is immense, and there
can be little doubt that, ultimately,
The world’s most propitious continental laboratory
large installations in Antarctica will use
atomic power as a matter of course. The
USA has carried, and is still carrying,
a considerable technological burden
since the installation of the plant in
1961. Major extensions and modifica-
tions have recently been carried out. If
the power output is equated with the
number of technicians required to keep
the reactor functioning, the snags that
have had to be located, the problems
of storing radio-active waste, the
monitoring in order to detect possible
contamination of personnel and work-
ing space: the net gain over con-
ventional power generating might be
questioned. But the whole enterprise is
a technical tour de force, just as the US
establishment and maintenance, from the
air, of a complete scientific station at
the South Pole itself ranks as an un-
surpassed demonstration of man’s
logistic power.
It is an astonishing fact that the
Antarctic Continent—from the discovery
of which Captain Cook believed the
world could “derive no benefit” —today
contains Australia’s nearest nuclear
reactor, and major research establish-
ments of all the great world powers.
With the advent of the atomic bomb,
science was enveloped in such an aura
of prestige that a government’s reputa-
tion, no less than the efficiency of its
undertakings, became linked with its
scientific enlightenment. And this gave
the International Council (ICSU) such
encouragement that they dared propose
the International Geophysical Year for
1957, a concerted effort by scientists in
many disciplines, ignoring national
frontiers and iron curtains, which might
make real progress in estimating and
evaluating the invisible and intangible
energies, emanating from or arriving
upon our planet, no less than those
phenomena whose gross manifestations
could be traced back no very great dis-
tance to the benign or malevolent gods.
The world-wide effort might cost £2OO
million —enough to sustain Australia’s
Antarctic research for a couple of cen-
turies but so long as some might be
applied to moon rocketry, satellites,
atomic piles and submarines, color tele-
vision, every kind of telemetry, to
medical, martial, or domestic gadgets—
governments were prepared to under-
write pure science and, perhaps less
wittingly, pure civilisation.
By the time the IGY was over, it had
become a household word. When the
scientists contemplated a continuance of
the work in Antarctica, no great nation
failed to respond. ICSU’s
special body, SCAR (Scien-
tific Council for Antarctic
Research) was set up, to
meet periodically in the
capitals of the world. It helps formulate
the programmes which are crystallised
in the continuing international effort in
Antarctica.
Before ANARE, of course, Australia
possessed a fine polar tradition in the
expeditions of Sir Douglas Mawson, Sir
Hubert Wilkins, John Rymill, J. K.
Davis, and several other notable ex-
plorers and scientists. With almost 10
years of ANARE, she had gained a fly-
ing start to the IGY. According to the
traditional criteria exploration, flag-
raising, proclamations, and residence
her claim to a large slice of the white
polar icing was well founded. As a
highly respected scientific power after
the IGY, she agreed, with other nations,
including the United Kingdom, the United
States of America, and the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics, to become a
signatory to the pact. This does not, in
any way, abrogate national claims; it
just puts them into cold storage for a
planned period of three decades, in the
light of an agreement that any of the
scientific and geographical explorations
that may be carried out during the
period of the treaty will not be recog-
nised as a basis for future territorial
claims. This has had the effect of
removing the pressure from geographical
exploration, and of turning the search-
light of prestige from the extension of


maps to the expansion of purely scientific
projects and the publication of relative
papers.
Whereas Australia could not hope to
compete in magnitude with the logistics
of the USA and of the USSR, in the
quality of research, and in the elegance
of solutions to every problem, she has
been able to hold her own and com-
mand the utmost respect. Many of the
instruments—all-sky cameras, for photo-
graphing the entire night sky simul-
taneously, photometers and image - in-
tensifiers whereby auroras and air-glow
too dim for human sight may be evalu-
ated, cosmic-ray telescopes—all sorts of
apparatus necessary to the extension of
man’s sensory range have been im-
proved, developed and constructed in
Australia.
The design for the new station to
replace Wilkes, temporarily known as
Repstat, will incorporate some new and
neat solutions to salient problems of life
in Antarctica. To eliminate the high
drifts which plague most Antarctic
stations, the huts, in a long line across
the wind, will be raised several feet
above the rock surface chosen for the
site. Wind-tunnel experiments support a
mass of empirical data gleaned from
more than 12 years of continuous ex-
perience. A streamlined covered way
for ease and safety of movement be-
tween the huts, large mesh storage
platforms inhibiting drift accumulation,
and other refinements promise to make
the new station a model of its kind. In
the matters of heating and insulation of
huts, Australian engineers and tech-
nicians again have produced some novel
and highly efficient arrangements. Power-
ful diesel generators will provide energy
for radio, a complex mass of scientific
equipment, and for domestic purposes;
but. in addition, a high percentage of
ambient heat from the engines will be
reticulated through the buildings.
Using “D 4” tractors, weasels, “Snow-
tracs”, motor toboggans, “Beaver” air-
craft, small helicopters and dog-teams,
Australian field parties have explored,
surveyed and mapped, tens of thousands
of square miles of Australian Antarctic
Territory. From expedition vessels,
chartered from the Danes, the small ice-
ships (all between 1200 and 2200 tons),
Kista, Thala, Magga and Nella Dan,
Law and his teams have virtually com-
pleted the survey of about 4000 miles of
coast bounding our immense sector, be-
tween Oates Land and Enderby Land.
The cry for our own Australian ice-
vessel continues to sound. We could
also accomplish a great deal with large
helicopters. Great interest is being
extended to the possibilities of hover-
craft, conceivably the safest and mosf
efficient of all transport over the
crevassed sastrugi.
The remarkable return traverse be-
tween Wilkes and Vostok, the inland
Russian depot, a total distance of about
2000 miles, undertaken by an Australian
team led by New Zealander Robert
Thompson in the summer of 1962-63,
demonstrated that even with our limited
logistic resources, a major journey,
creditable by any standards, could be
achieved. Characteristically, the Rus-
sians were co-operative in mak'ng avail-
able all the facilities of the inland base,
and the Americans contributed by
making an airdrop of tractor-fuel. On
that unusually long, and yet not un-
typical journey, seismic sounding re-
vealed the greatest ice depth, 16,000
feet, so far discovered in the world.
Temperatures on the ice plateau, at
12.000 feet altitude, had ranged down to
minus 83 degrees F.
Antarctic science is indivisible; with-
out exception all nations at work there
have co-operated to produce knowledge
of Antarctica that, without the immense
impetus of the IGY, and of the period
following since, might have remained
ungleaned for a century. This scientific
Elegant solutions for odd problems
collaboration has grown to be taken for
granted; an immense, never-sleeping
awareness of what is happening at our
end of the world, and how events are
affecting the rest of the planet;
Never, and in no other region of the
world, has truly international co-opera-
tion been maintained so strongly. Yet,
by the many voluntary and courageous
acts of succour between lonely parties
of men. there has grown an added
solidarity.' These are not rare; the
evacuation, in the face of grave dif-
ficulty, of a dangerously ill Australian
is typical. A Russian plane carried the
patient in an unpressurised aircraft, at
low altitude, on a seven-hour flight to
Mirny, 720 miles east of Mawson. . As
soon as weather permitted, a larger
Soviet aircraft flew with the injured man
and the Australian expedition doctor to
McMurdo Sound, a further 1600 miles.
By helicopter, he was carried to the
American base, and then flown the
2200 miles, by a US Navy Hercules
to Christchurch. Ten days after leaving
Mawson, the patient was in Sydney, and
eventually made an excellent recovery.
Antarctica will not be exhausted of
scientific interest: geophysically it is
unique. For long and short-term weather
forecasting, the maintenance of meteoro-
logical stations, both manned and auto-
matic, will presumably become more,
rather than less, important as flight lines
increase across the southern hemisphere.
Many great circle routes, of course, such
as the shortest routes between Adelaide
and Rio de Janeiro, or between Perth
and Buenos Aires, pass directly over the
south polar plateau. It has been proved
that roads and airfields may be con-
structed from _ice. Strategists have
pointed out that, were the great canals
blocked to traffic, the southern routes
round Cape Horn and the Cape of Good
Hope would be vulnerable to weapons
based on the polar continent.
No one doubts that Antarctica con-
tains great mineral wealth; indications
of many minerals have been noted. Un-
fortunately, however, the immense over-
burden of ice—enough, if it melted, to
raise the world's oceans by 200 feet —•
makes it possible that little mining will
ever be undertaken. Yet, who knows?
There are many thousands of rocky
pinnacles projecting from the plateau;
certainly surface indications of sufficient
concentration could be worth pursuing.
The dream of a Kalgoorlie or a Rum
Jungle may be sustained for the years
to come.
Whaling in southern waters is declin-
ing. The necessity for conservation
and biological control is again ap-
parent. Such measures have been
successful with some other of the
large mammals; even the fur seals,
brought to the verge of extinction in the
early years of last century, appear to be
recovering. It appears much more likely
that the southern oceans will be farmed
for food than that the continental ice
will be delved for metals. The ocean is
a three-dimensional source of vast
potential supplies of protein which,
derived either from the larger mammals
or from the minute plankton must
ultimately be exploited.
The world’s largest supply of fresh
water —about seven million cubic miles
of it—may find some fundamental, even
unexpected use. It has, of course, often
been suggested that Antarctica might
find some use as a vast planetary re-
frigerator. All Antarcticans rave about
the scenery. With suitable facilities, by
no means difficult to envisage, it might
have high tourist potential—perhaps pro-
vided a thousand dollars per week did
not seem too excessive. Yet all the tech-
niques of living in the south polar regions
have been mastered. At short notice,
should ever industry, or primary pro-
duce, or strategy provide sufficient in-
centive and purpose, transfers of popula-
tion to Antarctica could become a reality.
In the meanwhile it is a land of
scientific opportunity where men and
nations may discover world prestige in
the ever more elegant solutions of many
odd problems.

The End of the World
Anthony Cave Brown flew to the South Pole in January ,
1958, to greet Dr Vivian Fuchs and Sir Edmund Hillary
after their great journey across the Antarctic Continent .
ON the hardstanding of the Christ-
church airport the Globemaster of
the US Air Force loaded 120 men
destined to spend nine months of their
life in the daylong, utter darkness of an
Antarctic winter. Moving with them
through the great bow doors and in-
tegrated ramp of the freighter were fir
trees and marigolds; mail; mobile
generators to give out-stations at Cape
Terror and Cape Adare more light and
power; crews in orange flight suits. The
ground crews gave a final pre-flight check
on the aircraft systems as a final pre-
liminary for this, the most dangerous
flight in the world: 3200 miles in 14
hours to a continent of 43 million square
miles of ice.
In the Quonset hut the flight briefing
officer read the in-flight weather reports
and terminal conditions at McMurdo
Sound, the extinct volcano and main
base for the United States in Antarctica,
where the landing strip is enclosed by
the 10,000 feet high mountains of the
Prince Albert Range, and is situated on
ice ten feet thick. The weather reports,
handed to us on pink teletyped slips,
were: non-turbulent cloud at 9500 feet
down to the roaring forties, strato-
cumulus cloud (which wraps an aircraft’s
visibility like a Uondon fog) from about
the Antarctic Circle at 66 degrees, 33
minutes south, right down to our land-
fall near McMurdo Sound. It was not
the sort of weather which would deter a
Qantas pilot over the South China Sea,
but it was marginally, potentially danger-
ous for the Texas-based crew which
waddled on to the flight deck and
settled at the controls.
"EG\)r, once the point of no-return was
A reached in the area of Scott Island,
there was nowhere else except McMurdo
to go to except down on to an icy sea
prowled by killer whales, studded with
’bergs and green and blue-colored pack
ice riddled with sea rot: a grey-white
world where human survival is measured
in minutes.
It was the strato-fog which troubled
the captain and the flight meteorological
officer. If it closed in simultaneously
with sunspot-induced radio storms the
basic electronics navigation systems
would be neutralised or disorganised so
that the radio compass would oscillate
disastrously like a disturbed brain. It
had happened before. In white-outs.
This is a weather condition where all
visibility is blotted out by the white of
the ice and snow at ground zero, and
the white of airborne snow whirling
among the stratofog to a height—often
—of the aircraft's optimum operating
altitude. The effect is one of a taxi-
man utterly disorientated by fog finally
.crashing his vehicle into an icy stream
or into a building.
There was no alternative but to make
the flight. The Ross ice shelf was break-
ing up rapidly. The landing strip on
the shelf would not last another 48
hours. There was no time to get an ice-
breaker to take the 120 men in, and
unless they were taken in the relief of
the party already at McMurdo would be
impossible that year. They would be
doomed to spending another winter of im-
penetrable blackness, married to condi-
tion zero blizzards and 200-knot winds.

weather improved . . . McMurdo pre-

Antarctic predictions could be really

rapidly. Said one crewman: “I met a
chopper pilot last time I was there. He
had been airborne only 40 minutes when
a white-out came flashing in and beat
him to the pad. He got over the pad
OK, and then found he could not tell the
difference between the surface and the
air. So he opened the door and dropped
his fountain pen over the side. To his
astonishment it stopped right beneath
the aircraft. It was only then that he knew
he had landed —otherwise he would have
gone on flying at 90 knots until he hit
something hard.”
It was midnight. The collapsible,
hydraulically operated ramp was folded
back into the belly of the Globemaster.

As the night became colder I began
to change into my Antarctic clothing.
First, long silk underwear, then wool,
then kapok-padded trousers tucked into
hand-stitched and insulated Italian-made
mountain-climbing boots. There were
thick woollen check lumberjack shirts,
thick woollen socks over silk linings and,
finally, orange-colored and feather-lined
windproofed jacket designed by Sir
Edmund Hillary for his assault on the
peak of Mount Everest,
I settled down for the night, my feet
resting on boxes marked “developing
fluid” and “photographic equipment”
which in fact contained enough scotch,
gin and brandy to see me through a
goodly part of the Antarctic winter
for McMurdo, like all US Naval estab-
lishments, is “dry”. The aircraft seemed
to be lumbering as it hit patches of the
backlash of the roaring forties’ cold air
streams, and I could not sleep, so I
made a bower amongst the firs . . .

orange. For the color is most easily seen
from the air: our tail fin was, for
example, painted orange so that if we
went down on snow or ice we could be
seen more easily and quickly by air-
search aircraft. The firs were aboard,
each 20 feet high, for putting upright
at the ends of runways to give pilots
visual idea of their height as they made
their final landing approaches in bad
weather.
The inboard motor coughed. It
coughed again. Unease descended; that
sort of unease which you can feel em-
brace any airline cabin when the plane
hits rough air or black oil begins to
seep out through rivets or in the land-
ing process down through bad weather.
The flight deck door opened. Down the
steps came the flight mechanic. He
opened a door in the area of the wing
root, crawled out into the wing, and
then reappeared after eight minutes.
“Bit of mag. trbuble. Fixed.”
I dug into a can of peaches as we
passed the point of no-return. Del

we had made our first landfall, Cape
Adare and Possession Island, and Mt
Levick, 9098 ft.
world ahead had a white thun-
derous look about it. The awakening
sky above at this time was clear up to
the E layer, but the troposphere
was thickening over the continent ahead
which is, virtually, without life or
treasure except for the wandering
albatross, seals, king penguins and the
whalebone whale, amoebae and the
men then manning the International Geo-
physical Year stations. There beyond
Cape Adare was the continent of ice,
an ice cap larger than the continent of
Europe, bounded by the stormy southern
seas, deserted except for the icebergs
which calve off the ice cap to drift far
out into the ocean.
I imagined we were flying into some
Shangri-la with its own lore, beyond
the frontier man’s religions, philosophies:
away from the conflicts, the disasters, the
politics, the dictates, dowm to the end
of the world, propelled by Pratt and
Whitneys and borne on wings moulded
from aluminium of California, to a
world which is, and always has been,
monastic ... for no human female is
known to have walked dow'n there; dowm
to the birthplace of the brickfielder w'inds
and the southerly busters.
As predicted, sunspots began to inter-
fere with our radio and direction-finding
equipment. The beam put out from
McMurdo down where w'e were flying
was being fractionated and bent. Radio
communications between aircraft and
base were becoming unintelligible. From
now onwards we would have to fly
visually. The magnetic compass was
proving unreliable. The aircraft entered
the stratofog and the captain ordered his
co-pilot to take the plane above the
layer to enable the marine navigator to
take astral sightings with a sextant
through the plexiglass astro-hatch in the
ceiling of the cockpit. It was in this
manner that we fixed our position. The
pilot occasionally corrected the course
of the aircraft to allow for the slight drift
through Wind movement but a drift
of .5 of a second every ten minutes
could, over 90 minutes, bring the air-
craft off-course so disastrously in the
narrow mountainous approaches to the
D own where the southerly
busters come from
landing strip that the aircraft could
crash into a mountainside.
The meteorological officer asked the
captain to take the aircraft down below
the strato-ice cloud layer, and the cap-
tain reduced power so that the plane
gradually came down to 400 feet. The
sea was steel grey, flecked with low ice
floes. Around were ’bergs, their tops lost
in the cloud. There was a whale resting
on the surface. The sea was calm
amongst the ice. The meteorological
officer lit a cigarette, took coffee in a
carton from the crew chef, said nothing
but advised the captain to take the plane
back up to operating altitude.
The big Globemaster lumbered on like
a beetle trying to find its way by instinct
out of a bale of wool. A group of us
stood behind the pilot and co-pilot cover-
ing all points south as if we were a
watch in a storm. The pilot warned the
navigator to base his calculations on the
estimated whereabouts of Mount Erebus,
and to advise when the mountain was
estimated to be five minutes out.
A while later the navigating officer
reported over the intercom: “Erebus
estimated in seven minutes.” The captain
turned the aircraft on to a reciprocal
course and descended beneath the cloud
cover. No land was sighted but, as he
took the aircraft back whence it had
come for three minutes to give him time
and room in which to manoeuvre if the
dead reckoning calculations were proved
inaccurate, a parachute flare, like red
dye blotching wool, descended through
the cloud ahead, followed by a succession
of others. McMurdo radio control, silenc-
ed by aberrations on the face of the sun,
had heard the Globemaster groping
overhead and was launching a line of
parachute flares to guide us in.
The Globemaster touched down. The
ice rose and fell and cracked beneath
its weight. There was Mount Erebus,
its peak in those clouds, its 250-million-
year-old lava like burned gunpowder in
the snow, and the “town” of McMurdo
with its orange buildings. Men in parkas
with fur fringing their hoods drove
snow-weasels out to meet us, waving and
shooting off a flare or two as a greeting.
The props stopped. The bow doors
opened. The/ ramp went down. We
waddled out into the lung-catching cold.
A Seabee brought out my developing
fluid and then drove me to my quarters
on Honeybucket Avenue, McMurdo
Sound, Antarctica. Before lunch a
group of us went on to the side of
Erebus with a bottle of gin and some
ginger ale, which we stuck in the ice
to chill. Below was the Globemaster,
loading the men we had relieved. Both
its port engines were to catch fire at the
point of no return, but we were not to
know that, and that event does not fit
this story.
We were to go out in a condition
zero blizzard, winds running at 100
knots, on the ice-breaker Glacier. Its
keel was yet to be ripped off in a
collision with a submerged ’berg, which
also drove a hole big enough to take a
Holden in its bow. But for the moment
we drank with prudence, and waited to
go up to the Pole to greet Fuchs and
Hillary after their great journey across
the ice continent. It had been a long
night’s journey to the end of the world.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
George Bell, Looking Back
Cezanne. .. Menzies ... Nolan
By PATRICK TENNISON
George Bell, at 86 the undoubted
Grand Old Man of Australian Art,
is having his first one-man exhibi-
tion since 1921. The exhibition is at
Melbourne's Leveson Gallery. “No, it’s
not any sort of comeback,” Bell ex-
plained gently. “I’ve been painting all
the time. My house has become so
crowded with paintings I want to get
rid of some of them.”
Bell has, of course, exhibited regularly
with three or four paintings in group
shows in those intervening 44 years.
And there has been a stream of sales to
visitors who call at his Toorak home.
But the current show has caused some
surprise, because these days George Bell
hasn’t been in the news so much. Not
that he's complaining . . .
“These days art in Australia has gone
ratbag,” he said. “I doubt that I’ve got
much of a public any more. But I still
believe there's a big public that likes
real painting.” He was even chary of
putting his own prices on the exhibits,
and left it to the gallery. They have
tagged them at 75 to 500 guineas.
At this stage in Australia’s art develop-
ment it’s impossible to find any sort cf
accurate niche for George Bell. Ultra-
modern adherents would probably sneer-
ingly call him determinedly traditionalist,
yet those with memories sufficiently long
must remember that he played a big role
in introducing what was then called
modern art into Australia after the First
World War.
Now he claims credit for introducing
Cezannism into Melbourne, admitting
that Sydney “had it” slightly sooner. But
that stage accomplished, Bell admits to
being fearful of the spate of what he calls
“short movements” that have come since
Cezanne. “They’ve never lasted. This
new one they call abstract expressionism
won’t last either. Then some have gone
on to pop art and now op art. It’s funny
what they’ll come at.„ They try to dazzle
instead of charm and entertain you.
They’ve got to keep trying to invent
something new, but they might as well
try to invent a new game of chess. Art
has its conventions the same as anything
else the same as football.”
Looking back, he could review a long
career and claim it entirely devoid of
low spots. An indulgent father had
supported him in his earliest days, despite
the fact that the same father’s ambition
had been for him to do law rather
than art. .Born at Kew, Melbourne, in
December, 1878, the young George Bell
was interested only in art and studied
at the National Gallery in Melbourne
under Bernard Hall. Later he graduated
to become a drawing teacher at the
school.
Now, after many years devoted so
largely to portraiture, he explains:
“Portraiture is a bastard art. It’s ait
applied to history. It’s not true art, but
GEORGE BELL IN THE BULLETIN, 1926.
it was the only thing they taught us at
the gallery.”
He went to England in 1904 and stayed
16 years. His career high spot, he says
now, was in 1910 when London critics
waxed enthusiastic over his work, par-
ticularly his big three-subject piece “The
Conversation” a gentle, Edwardian
grouping that the artist still owns and
is showing again at the Leveson Street
Gallery.
On his return to Melbourne in 1920
he held an exhibition in 1921, then
settled in to become with Meldrum
one of the major influences in Melbourne
art.
In the years since, the biggest
European influence on Bell and the
school he founded would have been, after
Cezanne, Modigliani. Bell was soon in
the midst of the art convulsions that
rocked Australia in the ’2os and ’3os.
He is still remembered for his famous
dispute in 1937 with Sir (then Mt)
Robert Menzies who, then Common-
wealth Attorney-General, set out to form
an Australian Academy of Art. Bell was
invited to help but ended up organising
opposition to the whole scheme on the
grounds that Australia lacked the
traditions and, anyway, too many lay-
men seemed to be involved.
In speeches and letters to editors, the
Bell-Menzies row became violently pub-
lic. In the end, Bell broke right away
and with a big squad of other artists who
followed him formed, in 1938, the Con-
temporary Art Society. The academy
idea died stillborn.
Today. Bell remembers and grins over
it all, “Ming’s not a bad sausage. He
did say later that I was the only
antagonist he had who knew how to
behave himself. He was like the ordinary
fellow who thought an artist was like a
photographer. I’ve met him once or
twice since, mainly at the Savage Club
where we were both members before I
resigned. At the time he was only
voicing what I’d said 10 years before.”
In 1940 Bell had another clash, this
time in his own Contemporary Art
Society, over whether a new, young
painter named Sidney Nolan should be
allowed to hang one of his works called
“Boy and the Moon” in the CAS
Exhibition that year. Bell lost that row,
quit and set up his own school to teach.
Now, 25 years later, his views are the
same. “No, I haven’t changed my
opinion about Nolan. I’ve lived in Lon-
don and I know how it’s done.”
Bell’s school still functions, but now
only on Friday afternoons and Saturdavs
with a select group of over-eighteen-
year-olds. “I still like to keep in touch
with young people. Otherwise I’d die.”
Among the many talents developed in
Bell’s studio over the years must be
included Russell Drysdale, Sali Herman
and the late Peter Purvis Smith.
“Some come back and see me, some
don’t. Russell Drysdale never passes
through Melbourne without coming to
see me. He was always a very keen
and hard worker. We’d talk about some-
thing one week and the next week he’d
come back and show me what he’d done
about it. These days too many of them
are trying very hard to make it look
easy. It’s an example of modern
bodgieism. Drysdale was never like that.
He knew from the start it’s never easy.”
Bell still finds it this way himself to-
day. “No, it’s not any easier for me now
at 86 than when I was 16. I can do
more now, but the struggle is just as
hard. Once you do it easily you’ll be
looked at easily. I remember Bernard
Hall once telling me, ‘You can’t get more


thought out of a picture than you put
into it.’ Don’t let anyone ever tell you
differently, these ‘beaut country’ people
and all the others.”
St Francis in
the Kimberleys
By JUDITH RICH
Clifton Pugh will become the first
Australian painter to exhibit in
Mexico when his one-man show
opens in Mexico City next month. Pugh
and his family will live in Mexico for
some time, vacating their house in 200
acres of virgin bush in the artists’ colony
of Cottles Bridge, outside Melbourne.
“We have kangaroos hopping in and
out of the house all the time,” said Pugh,
settling his big bulk into a chair at
Sydney’s Rudy Komon Gallery where
l|is latest series of paintings —on the
Kimberleys went on show last week.
‘|My wife, Marlene, has been rearing
kangaroos. They’re growing up and
parting to have families. When we get
back we’ll be grandparents. There’s a
wombat and an emu, too.”
Pugh, 41, has been out of Australia
before only as a “brash, fun-loving, hell-
raising, young soldier”. “It’s time I got
outside Australia,” he explained. “When
I look at the landscape now I see the
same symbols —my own symbols im-
posed on the bush. When I come back
I’ll have the lovely pleasure of walking
in the bush and seeing it all anew.”
Mexico, to Pugh, has an environmental
feeling like Australia. “I’m not being
nationalistic—just geographic,” he said.
“I'm a regional painter and I like the
feel of the country. A savagery is in
the people there which I feel here in the
bush.”
Pugh has no inclination to go to
Europe. He sees nothing there for him.
He makes the standard accusations about
Europe being too sophisticated, artificial.
Storm Over “Silence”
The clash of right and right?
ALEXANDER HAY as Pope Pius XII.
MARK McMANUS as Father Fontana.
Rolf Hochhuth’s controversial play,
“The Representative”, comes to Aus-
tralia three full years after its Berlin
premiere. It will open at Sydney’s Old
Tote on July 10. The storm which raged
in Europe and North America on the
main issue raised in the play the
degree of responsibility which- Pope
Pius XII, because of his “silence”, must
take for the fate of the Jews under
Hitler has subsided, although, of
course, the issue remains.
Last year THE BULLETIN pub-
lished Jewish and Roman /Catholic
commentaries on the play by people
who then had only read it.
On March 28, Mr Isi Leibler, sum-
ming up his arguments, wrote:
“The question that should not be
asked by non-Catholics who do not
recognise the Pope as God’s represen-
tative on Earth is ‘Should not the
Vicar of Christ have been expected to
rise above his contemporaries at a time
of crisis? . . .’ In the future such a
question may well be posed and an-
swered by Catholics assessing Pius XII
as the Vicar of Christ. It is Catholics,
and Catholics alone, who can grant
Pius XII the verdict of history as ‘The
Representative’. Most non-Catholics
will probably conclude that, as a human
being entrusted with great leadership
responsibilities, the Pope shared the
failings of most European leaders with
regard to Nazism the fault of tem-
porising, appeasing, and remaining
silent whilst a barbaric totalitarian
regime committed unspeakable crimes
against humanity.”
Mr Brian Buckley, on April 18, wrote:
“ ‘The Representative’ is a man who
knows that his intervention will cer-
tainly assist the Jews in their plight,
and who is willing to sacrifice them for
entirely inadequate and disgraceful
reasons. But this man is not, in my view,
Pope Pius XII. Pius was in a different
predicament; he did not know whether
a loud and clear Vatican denunciation
of the Nazi persecution would cause
more harm than good. He may have
made the wrong decision, but not at
all for the reasons that Hochhuth
suggests.”
Mr Buckley then quoted Pius’s letter
to the Bishop of Berlin in 1943, when
the Pope spoke of the need to “exercise
restraint ad maiora mala vitanda (to
avoid greater evils)”.
“And yet the question remains,” Mr
Buckley concludes. “Are there not cer-
tain crimes which demand outcry from
all honest men? Are there not certain
unhuman sufferings imposed upon one’s
brothers under God that demand any
comfort possible, even if only given
from the tongue? Are not some per-
secutions so monstrous that in the face
of them silence is almost complicity?
“Does not the extermination, the
gassing, the shooting, the starving, the
degradation of millions of people make
a moral calculus which contains terms
like ‘the prevention of greater evils’
sound hollow? Tragedy, said Hegel, is
not the clash of right and wrong, but
the clash of right and right.”

His paintings testify to an awareness of
v.hat he calls “the fringe of Nature
which is still over Australia”. In Aus-
tralia man hadn’t “put his own ego over
it”, said Pugh. Until 1964, he said, his
paintings ot the bush always put animals
in human situations. “I couldn’t put
humans in because 1 felt them to be
alien.” he said. “I felt man was the one,
big. horrible mistake on this planet. Man
was out of harmony with the earth,
opposed to it. When I went to the
Kimberlevs last year 1 got a shock. The
people up there are in harmony with the
environment The Aborigines and the
white stockmen don’t try to alter it. I
found mvself beginning to feel that
human beings were right after all.”
Pugh explained that he had to then
find a way of putting man into his paint-
ings and eventually decided upon St
Francis “This symbol was not neces-
sarily religious. St Francis was just try-
ing to belong. He was a lover of all
things around him. He used to say
‘sister animals’, ‘brother rocks’. Using
St Francis and putting him wandering
round the Kimberleys was in a way the
experiences that I was having.”
Pugh studied art with Dargie under
the Commonwealth Reconstruction
Training Scheme. He spent a great deal
of his time under the scheme in the bush.
“It was on a trip to Perth, across the
Nullarbor, that I decided what I wanted
to paint about,” he said. “I felt a
terrific empathy with Nature. Later, at
Cottles Bridge I found a kangaroo which
had been shot. Where its remains were,
a beautiful orchid had grown. It had
to die to produce that orchid. Death
has no fear for me now. We have
skeletons on the walls at home. Even
the children are riot afraid of them.”
TELEVISION
The Never Never
Rusty Bugles. Sumner Locke-Ediott, ABC
Television.
During the last major war many thou-
sands of young men were dumped in
the Northern Territory scrub for long
periods. Before 1942 others had similar
frustrating experiences in Queensland and
New Guinea, advance depots of human
ordnance in “mothballs” until the army
needed it, which in some instances was.
never. Many wasted up to six years of
their youth in this futile way, and “Rusty
Bugles” remains the only indictment of
the Australian Army Command’s in-
human neglect of these men, of which I
can write with some feeling. Forgotten as
they were, deployed as they were, armed
with Lee-Enfields and 20 rounds, they
knew how useless they were and felt it
keenly, for years.
In this respect Sumner Locke-Elliott’s
play, too often regarded as a lightweight
piece of minor humor about some
soldiers bored in the bush, is really a
serious work and a valuable one, pro-
bably exposing more shibboleths than
“The One Day” or any other Australian
drama. Never trust without question an
Army which has once been capable of
action, or inaction, which thousands of
men knew was ridiculous, and about
w hich they could do nothing, say nothing.
In the television version, adapted by
John Warwick and produced by Alan
Burke, most of the flavor of “Rusty
Bugles” came through strongly, the
numerous men were well portrayed, and
Kevin Brooks’ design was, I assure you,
evocative. Two characters not fully rea-
lised were Gig Ape, whose part seemed
cut to poirtlessness, and the Sergeant
whose combination of sadist and toady
was not well drawn. But, for a down-to-
earth representation of the Australian
character in most of its less civilised
moods, “Rusty Bugles” was more so than
three of the works discussed last week
by those quaint fellow's “The Critics” in
a half hour devoted to Australiana.
The lack of a strong plot in “Rusty
Bugles” has been mentioned, and in con-
ventional terms this is so. But in a similar
drama of wartime frustration, “Mr
Roberts”, the high point was merely the
destruction of the Captain’s sacred potted
palms. In comparison, the Australian play
had several high points, although they
were as anthills on a vast plain.
It had taken television eight years to
get this play to viewers. I hope it will be
repeated sooner. It is a valuable play, in
a time when another crisis might require
another prolonged stand-to in the Never
Never. My reaction to “Rusty Bugles”
was to remember that the Army, any
army, is a bureaucratic machine which
needs the constant oiling of public
opinion and must not be allowed to
hide its more ridiculous actions behind
a security screen. Of Australia's 50,000 or
so service men and women, I wonder how
many are, even now, gathering rust at
seme “advanced ordnance depot”?

PROBLEM
How to brand a
rubber diving suit
IMlil
A SELEX DECAL
Elastical Transfer
You wouldn’t call this an everyday problem. It was a very
real problem to the diving suit manufacturer, until he called
in Selex Decal. He found, to his surprise, that Selex Decal
had lots of experience in branding rubber —devising
transfers for tyres, waders, vee belts, etc. But this material
was different —black neoprene sponge rubber. Undeterred,
the Selex Decal lab. went to work. Without any developmen-
tal cost to the diving suit manufacturer, Selex Decal pro-
duced transfers printed with a colourful trademark design
which would cure into the rubber, s-t-r-e-t-c-h, and remain
impervious to the effects of salt water, scuffing, even soap.

The troupe, brought together from all
over France, is still a beautifully
balanced one, on the male as well as the
female side. The two ballerinas, petite
and gamin Liane Dayde, and Nina
Vyroubova, richly lyrical and con-
trolledly forceful in even so undis-
tinguished a piece as William Dollar’s
“Constantia”, with only one original
sequence, must be considered among the
first rank. In Pugni’s “Pas de Quatre”,
with Dolin’s choreography, Mile. Vyrou-
bova displays her full powers. This is
not to say that her partners, who, ex-
cluding Liane Dayde, are Janine Monin
and the charming and precise Maina
Gielgud, do not deserve admiration.
“Pas de Quatre” was written as a
vehicle for the great Taglioni, and
Vyroubova brilliantly revives the memory
of a poetic past.
The men Jimmy Urbain, Juan
Giuliano and Michel Bruel have
nothing of the effeminate, yet they also
escape the too acrobatjc. This even goes
for Urbain as the clown in the touching
and very Gallic “Les Forains” (The
Outsiders). Giuliano is perhaps the more
athletic, but Bruel, especially opposite
Liane Dayde in “Romeo et Juliette”, is
easily his equal. This extremely well-
known ballet, tactfully relying here on
a mere hint of background, regained a
remarkable freshness.
The alternative programme includes
“Giselle”, but the first consists of shorter
pieces. Nevertheless, there is unity,
though it was unwise to end a long even-
ing with Serge Lifar’s “Noir et Blanc”
tour xie force.
While too slight to encourage large
judgments, what we have been shown
suggests that the quest for virtuosity does
not rule the work of this, probably rep-
resentative, French ensemble. Certainly
classical, its approach is modern as well,
but decidedly not expressionistic and the
opposite of showy. It may have a mes-
sage for us in Australia.
DAVID MARTIN
State of Anarchy
The Advocate. Robert Noah. New Theatre,
Sydney.
Famous trials, such as the Sacco-Vanzetti
case on which this play is based, are
ready-made dramas, and “The Advocate”
has some powerful scenes. Robert Noah
takes the orthodox liberal view that
Sacco and Vanzetti were political
martyrs, unjustly convicted of murder in
a Massachusetts court, not because they
were guilty but because they were
anarchists.
Whether or not this is a true view,
Mr Noah does not go the right way
about establishing it dramatically, for he
presents only one side of the case. In


drama, if not in propaganda, this is
always a mistake.
The action of the play, still current
at the New Theatre, does not include
the trial itself, which took place in 1921,
but begins in 1923, half-way through
the six years which Sacco and Vanzetti
spent in prison while appeals w'ere made
against their conviction. The central
character is the conservative Boston
lawyer who took over the defence of
the tw'o anarchists at this time. The
programme tells us that the playwright
was fascinated by this incongruity and
set out to explore the lawyer’s character
in his play. But, after all. the character
he gives us is only a stock figure of a
just man. I found myself sympathising
with the Athenian who voted to ostracise
Aristides the Just “because I am sick
of hearing him called ‘the just’.”
Against this ideal hero is set the trial
judge who rejected the appeals. He is
represented as a stock villain. As a
result, the view put forward in the play
that Sacco and Vanzetti were un-
doubtedly innocent emerges as essen-
tially melodramatic. Doubtless the
opposite view, if presented in the same
over-simple way, would appear equally
so.
Norman Phillips, with his ascetic
features, is very well cast as the dedi-
cated advocate. David Calcott gives a
sympathetic portrait of Vanzetti the fish-
peddler as a gentle and reasonable
anarchist. Vince Gil’s violent Sacco pro-
vides a striking contrast, and he is well
supported by Fay Hughes as Rosa,
Sacco’s wife. Unfortunately, the large
cast is very weak at the edges. Paul
Williams obviously tried to move his
production along at a good pace, but
was unable to overcome the disjointed
effect produced by a very large number
of short scenes.

The Big Bang
Fail-Safe. Director, Sidney Lumet. Victory
Theatre, Sydney.
Concerto for Orchestra. Director, Robert
Parker; for the Australian Commonwealth
Film Unit.
Of course it’s not fair to compare “Fail-
Safe” with “Dr Strangelove”, but it’s
impossible not to; but even without the
sinister brilliance of Kubrick’s film still
fresh in the mind, I think “Fail-Safe”
would still disappoint. It is an eminently
sincere, right-thinking film, with an
articulate though rather stolid script. The
subject in itself is of such literally vital
importance that it commands attention.
I really hated myself for being so dis-
tracted by its shortcomings.
DEAN DIXON, conductor of the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra, with a promising young musician in the
Commonwealth Film Unit's film on the orchestra,
"Concerto for Orchestra".
The general situation is the same as
that of “Strangelove”: America and
Russia are engaged in a constant patrol
of each other’s frontiers by planes carry-
ing H-bombs which both nations hope
to God they'll never have to drop. But
an accident can set the plan in motion
in “Fail-Safe” it is the lunacy of
machines rather than of men and can
it be stopped in time?
Stanley Kubrick approached his theme
with a keen sense of the basic absurdity
of our self-destructiveness —how ridicu-
lous, after all, for a large number of
highly trained adults to spend their
working life ferrying about bombs that
nobody wants them to drop! but the
film was intensely serious. Sidney
Lumet’s film is just solemn.
Lumet is given to preaching. His
“Twelve Angry Men”, for instance, was
essentially a series of statements of
attitude, but his direction was- so taut,
his perception of character so sharp that
the dramatic impact was never lost. But
in “Fail-Safe”, based on a talky, sermon-
ising book, Lumet is so busy letting
people voice their opinions and explain
just why we’re all going up in smoke that
the excitement and immediacy are soon
dissipated; from a frightening picture of
the possible end of the human race the
film descends to the level of a debate.
Walther Matthau (as a violently anti-
communist warmonger) and Dan
O'Herlihy (as a professional soldier
appalled at the Gadarene rush towards
death) are the two star debaters, and
spend most of their time arguing instead
of doing something concrete to stop the
big bang. Garrulity has infected the
President of the US (Henry Fonda) as
well, whose main contribution to the
crisis is to have gentlemanly talks, full
of discreet apologies for the nasty mis-
take, to the Russian Premier on the hot
line. The Russian Premier takes it pretty
well, too, like the rest of the top brass,
none of whom ever behaves like a human
being. Frankly, Fd feel rather more
confidence in a leader who occasionally
jumped up and down and shouted.
Robert Parker’s short documentary on
the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, made
for the Commonwealth Film Unit, is to
be shown extensively overseas, particu-
larly in the countries which the orchestra
is to tour later in the year. This is a
fine idea—after all, many overseas
countries still spell our name as “Sidney”
and don’t know we’ve got any orchestra
above the didgeridoo level and it’s
pleasing to report that “Concerto For
Orchestra” is a short film well able to
hold its own by any international stan-
dards.
Mercifully avoiding the obvious
biographical approach, Parker (who also
worked on the script) takes the SSO as
it now is, and within the framework of
a Town Hall performance of Bartok’s
Concerto for Orchestra, shows that this
instrument is composed of individuals
with divergent interests, different lives,
welded into one by their own music
and the influence of the conductor.
After a little initial artiness, the film
becomes a fluent and interesting piece,
well photographed and recorded. It is to
be shown on ABC Television and could
well do with a commercial cinema
release.

Local Oedipus
Oedipus the King. Lola Russell Productions.
This two-record, stereophonic production
of Sophocles’ “Oedipus the King’’, by a
small Melbourne company headed by
Lola Russell and George Dixon, is an
ambitious, pioneering effort which de-
serves every encouragement. Their choice
of play was a wise one; the faultlessly
articulated plot and the superb delinea-
tion of even minor characters make it
ideal for recording.
To make the classic Greek drama
meaningful to modern, English-speaking
audiences, a great deal obviously depends
on the translation and, presumably, Miss
Russell had good reasons for choosing
that of the two American scholars, Robert
Fitzgerald and Dudley Fitts. Preserving
as it does the heroic dignity of the poetry
without loss of narrative and action, it
seems as good as any; indeed, it may
move faster than the comparable Watling
translation, an advantage in a recorded
version.
The tragedy being centred in Oedipus,

time and he does a remarkable job to
sustain this demanding role without the
inspiration of an audience. He reads his
lines with all the variety of pace, tone and
emotion they require and his enunciation
is exemplary. Robert Charles’ almost
casual interpretation of Creon contrasts
effectively, in their scenes together, with
Mr Dixon’s more declamatory style, while
Lola Russell’s Jocaste shows sympathy if
not quite the same degree of clarity.
Technically, the recording is excellent,
but there are occasional disturbing shifts
in the volume level, and one questions
the necessity for the almost continual
whistling of the wind.

MUSIC
Faultless Memory
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Antal Dorati,
conductor.
The forthcoming world tour by the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra, from
which its members should return with
fresh vigor and broadened experience,
will leave us without an orchestra for
two months. The foretaste came when
inoculations caused much illness and
absenteeism among the musicians; as a
result, visiting conductor Antal Dorati
found it impossible to rehearse Stravin-
sky’s programmed “Rite of Spring” and
ordained a last minute programme
change.
The first time I watched Mr Dorati
conduct was on February 21, 1940,
when Col Basil’s Russian Ballet pre-
sented a programme, including Rimsky-
Korsakov’s “Coq d’Or”. Dorati, a be-
ginner still but with extensive ballet ex-
perience, conducted an orchestra re-
cruited to tour with the ballet company
and led by Haydn Beck with aplomb and
a surprising degree of authority. Since
then, Mr Dorati has travelled far, music-
ally and geographically. His repertoire
includes almost every composer of note
after 1760, with the emphasis on Hun-
garian and Russian composers and, gen-
erally, the romantic and post-romantic
schools; he has recorded much of the
music of Bartok, his erstwhile teacher,
and has become popular and widely
acclaimed.
It becomes immediately clear that Mr
Dorati knows and understands his reper-
toire well. He conducted the whole
concert from a faultless memory and
obviously knew exactly what he wanted
from his players. If he did not always
get just that, he is not to blame; at the
same time, his particular style of con-
ducting is very unemphatic and almost
completely lacking in beats—something
most of our players rightly look for
from any conductor.
The highlight of the evening was
Strauss’ “Till Eulenspiegel’s Merry
Pranks”. Here, a conductor has the
choice of displaying orchestral virtu-
osity or of giving music of warmth,
humanity and humor. Dorati steered a
middle course and the orchestra re-
sponded quite happily, playing with good
accuracy, wit and sparkle.

Ants on a Saucer
By HAL PORTER
The Road to Gundagai. Graham Mclnnes.
Hamish Hamilton. 31s. 6d.
Book-reviewing is a blood sport which
does not attract me. I know far too
many writers as engaging human beings
and dear friends—how and why should
I let them know to their faces, for a
paltry fee of blood-money, what I think
behind their backs of their latest sweat-
stained opus? Why, then, light-heartedly
accept an invitation to review Graham
Mclnnes’s “The Road to Gundagai”?
Partly because I do feel rather fervently
that, at this tip-cat stage of Australia’s
literary history, this sort of book needs
to be written by this sort of person. By
“this sort of person” understand a writer
of Graham Mclnnes’s age, something
over the half-century mark. By “this sort
of book” understand an autobiography
covering a certain period, and certain
planes of that period, about which far
too little has been recorded.
Too much has been recorded about
Australia’s empty stomach or dead heart,
leaving the rest of the body for dead.
Mclnnes deftly calls Australia “that
harsh, grey-olive continent, around the
edges of which, like ants on an upturned
saucer, cling six million people”. (Six
million because he writes about the time
40 years ago when there were six
million.) I am delighted that Graham
Mclnnes has joined the recent band
of mature people and more or less
mature writers—who, autobiographically
or quasi-autobiographically, have put
down, in shades of Australian, things
that have been neglected before. If one
is to judge by George Johnston, Rose
Lindsay. Jack Lindsay, Alan Marshall,
Katharine Susannah Prichard, Hal Por-
ter, Jon Rose and others, autobiography
seems, at any rate just now, the liveliest
and most telling way to perform the
literary chore of wiping the mallee dust
and gum leaves and swaggie gobs off the
windscreen so that one can really see.
Now, to Graham Mclnnes. The pith
of the book is the frank record of the
Australianisation of a superior little
English boy. At the end of the Great
War this prideful child (“My father’s a
Captain, and you're only a common
Digger!”) travels to Australia on a troop-
ship with his English mother, his new
Tasmanian stepfather, and a nanny. After
a short time in Hobart, where they
live with his stepfather's fantastic and
fascinating mother, the menage moves
to 4 Grace Street, Malvern, 5.E.4, a Mel-
bourne suburb which Mclnnes finds has
much in common with Barrie Humph-
ries’ Humoresque Street —“one of those
endless aggregations of bricks, terra-
cotta and gentility . . . very middle class
and excessively suburban”. It is here,
and at school (Scotch College), at play
after school, during country and seaside
holidays, that the process of Australian-
isation takes place.
It is right to point out Mclnnes’s
brilliant success with this central theme:
he is lucid about his intentions. The
growing-up of the boy is dealt with
objectively and is, at times, heart-
squeezing. There is no doubt whatever,
subtle writer though he be, that Mclnnes
did not intend this note, otherwise he
would have been less pitiless in his self-
exposure. Even objectivity, however,
casts a faint shadow so that the final
picture is of a boy who, however in-
volved in the escapades and pleasures of
the time, is inwardly torn between be-
coming what he must and becoming
what his mother wants him to be. He
must, too, have secretly or subconsciously
yearned to take, as he did when he was
later able to, his father’s surname after
years of being made to wear his step-
father’s.
The central theme has its branches and
branchlets and leafy twigs, all meticu-
lously limned. This is Mclnnes’s most
craftsman-like feat the trunk does not
dominate the tree, the twigs do not
obscure the clear design of the many
branches. This is not easy to do. It
must have been harder to keep this
balance (it may, of course, not have
been) because Mclnnes’s mother was
Angela Thirkell who, though not yet a
novelist in the period the autobiography
covers, was already behaving with the
cut-’em-down acridity and scornful man-
nerisms of certain sorts of famous
people. Her son blames her waspishness
on an inarticulate heart, a heart “deeply
buried ... a small animal in a burrow
peering with frightened beady eyes at
the intruder; and when it put out its
tongue, as though in affection, woe
betide the hand that reached for it . . .
a snap and a raising of lizardly hackles”.
Her son’s amazingly cool and un-
venomous portrait of a woman who was
in many ways selfish and snobbish is so
skilfully done that it does not get any-
where near dominating the fascinating
gallery of portraits, stereoscopically
executed and each of exactly the right
size—the boyish, one-of-the-lads father
with his souped-up cars, stamp collection
and tipplings of five-eighths of an inch
of whisky, the grotesque Tasmanian
mother-in-law and her deadbeat spouse,
the frieze of Ladv Helps who put up
with Angela Thirkell and her often
diabolic sons, the schoolmasters, the
police, the scoutmasters, the Western
District squattocracy, the Gallipoli-
toughened Diggers on the troopship, the
famous or near-famous people who came
to Angela Thirkell’s dinner-parties at
Malvern where, on one occasion at least,
they hoed into cantaloupes on which
Mclnnes and his brother Colin had
copiously spat. Some of the portraits
are masterpieces.
Mclnnes has the sort of X-ray eye
Which sees the significance of the thread
which binds character to setting, charac-
ter to possessions. He does this with,
apparently, throw-away ease, with the
art that conceals art, with style, wittily
and lovingly and, thank God. in detail
which is so often derided. Streets and
schools and ships and trains and motor-
cars and shops and clubs and movie-
houses and dunnies are meticulously
drawn. They are all there, those com-
monplace of 40 years ago—bicycles with
carbide lamps, castor oil, peach-jam sand-
wiches, chip-heaters in bathrooms, pince-
nez, sleepouts, cotton palms, standard
roses, cable trams, the ASPRO sign over
The Playhouse. Once only did I spot
an anachronism—a milk bottle. In the
metropolitan area milk did not begin
to be delivered in bottles until 1937, in
outer areas not until 1947.
Mclnnes also deals firmly with a
subject very few Australian authors care
to tackle, that of the infinitely graded
social differences within the democratic
hold-all. An historian, stuck with the
horrifying task of reading the sumless
books set in Australia between, say,
Trespassers
This is a government house. It's sacred:
even empty, as now, it’s by no means
dead;
merely resting between tenants. Doors
and windows are left untouched (raiding
kids respect that solid space behind glass):
there’s a shed labelled DOG-BOX in
large black letters
still- smelling of carbolic and big-booted
gods.
Down the road
is an old bach, lived in all its life
by a mother and two wrinkled sons.
When
she died the place went to pieces; the
“boys”
packed up and drifted; it was left for
dead:
kids set on it; bashed huge holes in its
skull;
carted the carcass off for firewood.
PETER BLAND


1900 and 1960, would discover a fairly
classless country, as though democracy
worked in the manner of a machine
stamping out plastic buttons. Every
Australian knows this is not so. Mclnnes
knows it is not so. In the pre-1930 era
he has put down so faithfully, 98.4 per
cent of Australians were of British
heritage, and a quarter of the population
had actually been born in the United
Kingdom. Social distinctions were, then,
more visible —or seemed to be more
visible. They are still, both for those
who find it necessary to look and for
those who pretend they don’t see what
they do see, quite visible. They are
clearly visible to Mclnnes not merely
because of what his mother tried to
teach him in snobbishness but because
he is a crystal-eyed observer. H&. gives,
for example, a run-down of the social
status of Melbourne’s churches and
church schools, and of seaside resorts
such as Portsea and Queenscliff. He
deals in a level-headed way with the
snobbery of the working classes, inverted
and brutally independent, and with the
honest non-snobbery of such a group as
the well-heeled, hard-working graziers,
Two portraits of Angela Thirkell are
included, one by Sargent, one by Thea
Proctor. There are five photographs of
family groups and sound idea two
simple maps.
The reader cannot have got as far as
this without realising that the book is
wholeheartedly recommended for its
multi-planed, sensitive, and wholly con-
vincing picture of an era, and its
sophisticated and deceptively easy style.
The Sad Case of James Bond
By DAVID McNICOLL
The Man with the Golden Gun. lan Flem-
ing. Jonathan Cape. 235.
lan Fleming’s last book was his worst.
In fact, “The Man with the Golden Gun”
is so poor it is hard to believe it was
written by the man who gave us “Casino
Royal” and “From Russia With Love”.
But then, of course, part of the book was
not written by the same man. Apparent-
ly Fleming died during the writing of
“Golden Gun” and a “ghost” finished
the book. It is an interesting exercise to
pick where Fleming finished and the
ghost started. It is not difficult, for the
ghost uses words which Fleming would
not have used.
There is a world-wide fascination at
present in the study of “Bond-mania”.
Men write learned essays about the
addiction to Bondism, and draw con-
clusions rather unflattering to us poor
saps who love the escapist nonsense
which lan Fleming produced so well.
Why this examination of enjoyment?
Why was it not done when Edgar Wal-
lace and “Sapper” held the world in
thrall with their heroes and their villains?
If liking Bond is a sick symptom, I am
a cot case from way back.
Kingsley ,Amis in “The James Bond
Dossier” tried, with some success, to
analyse Bond. Malcolm Muggeridge, in
his review of the Amis book, launched
an attack on Bond and Fleming. In
fact poor old Muggeridge got so worked
up in his hatred of Bond and distaste
for Fleming that one was left with a
strong impression that he was green with
envy for the respective prowesses and
successes of both men.
Muggeridge’s dissection of Bond and
Fleming brought a bitter letter from
Fleming’s brother (Colonel Peter Flem-
ing) in the London “Observer”. He re-
ferred to Muggeridge’s “curiously un-
pleasant article” and added: “to vilify
publicly, within a few months of his
death, a friend from whom he (Mug-
geridge) had received nothing but kind-
ness is not the sort of thing it would
occur to many of us to do; nor would
a reputable literary critic pontificate at
length about a writer with whose work
he was almost totally unacquainted. But
Mr Muggeridge’s standards of conduct
have always been idiosyncratic . . .”
All pretty harsh stuff, and indicative
of the passions Bond and Fleming can
stir. But Muggeridge and other critics
are right when they point to the decline
in Fleming’s skill. It is as though he
lost heart, and lost interest; perhaps he
was sick. In the “Golden Gun”, Scara-
manga is a weak and unfrightening
villain. The plot is a warm-over of situa-
tions from earlier books. The suspense
just isn’t there.
The scene is London and Jamaica.
There is an attempt by a brain-washed
Bond to kill M (a result which would
have satisfied quite a few readers) and a
pursuit of Scaramanga round the brothels
and luxury hotels of the West Indies.
It is tepid stuff this, and there is none
of the snobbish overlay to violence and
sex winch drags us mesmerised into
earlier Bond books.
How sad it is that a writer who
brought such pleasurable thrills to so
many should finish his late - starting
career as a thriller writer with a flop.
Four Aboriginal Sketches
(i)
He is only beautiful
In the manner of his country,
For he was burnt by the same enemy,
Was at the same treaty.
And now he lives on a concession
Which shifts with each season,
That he must follow it
As a jackal follows his lion,
Licking at gnawed bones
Till he himself is one,
Hollow and dry as an old tree,
Full of strange, delicate energy.
For he can walk a whole month
Into the desert in the dreamtime,
Can scent water on wind
And make rabbits jump into his hand.
He can hit a snake with a stone,
Birds with a boomerang;
Can play a long, sad note
And carve stories in bark,
Beautiful in the manner of his country.
(ii)
A child sulks upon the lawn,
Exhausted by the lawn’s piety._
She wants to take off her dress
And sink into the earth.
For the pink roses have twined
Braceleted arms about her neck
And roots round her body,
Sapping her strength.
(iii)
The black men hang their shadows
On ropes underneath the towers.
Their hats slip forward over their eyes,
Like the hats of lynched men.
They have been left standing, these few
People, like the dead gum trees,
Grotesquely upright still, but slowly
Blackening into antelope, shipwreck,
skeleton.
(iv)
They came to us like lepers
To be cured of nightmares
And we woke them up
And showed them their sores
And hung them like flypapers
In museums called Missions
And said “We are barely
Keeping them alive,” as if
We regretted the way they sometimes
Stirred up their own dust
With a little rhum,
Bought for them by a tourist.

The Working Reviewer
By CHARLES OSBORNE
The Working Novelist. V. S. Pritchett.
Chatto and Windus. 425. 6d.
It must be said at once that, although
one normally doesn’t want to encounter
weekly reviews—such as these 26 “New
Statesman” articles bunched together
into a book, Pritchett’s special qualities
are such that “The Working Novelist” is
most rewarding to read. One of his
strengths is that he has no preconceived
theory of the novel to measure his writers
by. “A novel can be anything,” he
w'rites. So Pritchett is capable of enjoy-
ing T. E. Lawrence and Jerome K.
Jerome, Ada Leverson and Saki. His
enjoyment communicates itself easily in
a sober, unvarnished but never clumsy
prose. The occasional asperity of a
liberal old schoolmaster peeps out when,
for instance, he writes of “the present
turdish taste for chi chi”, but he is never
unsympathetic in tone.
Pritchett relates Beckett to Oblomov
and, less unusually, to Irish garrulity in
general. True, one sometimes sees in
Beckett only the language of Shaw run
amok, but the idea of him as a modern
Oblomov, “fretful and'apathetic, enclosed
in private fantasy, dropping off into
words instead of sleep”, is rather more
engaging. Pritchett admits to finding
much of Beckett unreadable. Of course,
he is writing only of the novels; in the
plays Beckett’s language has a way of
coming vibrantly and defiantly alive in
the most unpromising situations. He ‘s
like a man who, having taken to heart
Kafka’s maxim: “Do not despair, not
even of not being able to despair.”
Ada Leverson was a comic writer of
a very different order. Until Colin Mac-
Innes did some propaganda work on her
behalf a few years ago, she was in
danger of being forgotten. During his
crisis she befriended Wilde, w'ho called
her “the Sphinx”. The name was apt:
in her elegantly observed and very neatly
written accounts of the enclosed Knights-
bridge - Belgravia world of the Ed-
wardians, the face of the author is
expressionless, the attitude apparently
ambiguous. Pritchett is inclined to be
snide about her wit and her limited
range, but he agrees that within that
range she operated with considerable
artistry.
If he underestimates Ada Leverson,
surely Pritchett is absurdly generous to
Anthony Powell. But then, who isn’t? I
have tried for years to be fair to Powell,
fearing that my boredom with his world
and his people may be so obsessive as
to have blinded me to the devastating
' irony with which he is said to display
them. I find Powell as leadenly tedious
as the people he describes, his style
featureless and flat, his humor non-
existent.
The occasion of the publication of all
four of Nathaniel West’s novels in one
volume gives Pritchett an opportunity to
re-assess the most remarkable American
novelist of the ’thirties, after Scott Fitz-
gerald. West is both a tragic and a
comic writer in the way that Chekhov
was. Pritchett actually makes the point
that, like Chekhov, he was appalled by
the banality of city civilisation, but had
lost any sense of tragedy, due to the
moral collapse of his period. But what
one loses as a man, one sometimes gains
as an artist. West’s tragic sense may
have been subterranean in his life, but
it emerges triumphantly in his art.
I have selected for mention here only
a few of Pritchett’s novelists who are
of more immediate interest to me. But
he casts his net wide, dragging in such
fish' as Maria Edgeworth, Ford Madox
Ford, Robert Surtees and Alfred de
Vigny. He even manages to make Trol-
lope sound possible, by praising
eccentricity.
Second Thoughts on Singapore
By EK DUM
Spotlight on Singapore. Denis Russell-
Times Press and Anthony
Gibbs arid Phillips. 465.
One of the newer and better considered
volumes on the Singapore debacle and its
after-effects, this is a personal story
highlighted by domestic tragedy which
cost the author a much-loved young wife
among the women prisoners who died
in Sumatra. But it is not a complaint
against 'fate. The tragedy is taken as
part of the fortune of war and the
narrative, though personal, is impersonal-
ised as far as is possible in such a story,
to describe the common, rather than an
individual, experience.
The book gives a vivid picture of the
men of the various forces, on our own
and the enemy side, of the careless and
unorganised days of the Japanese
occupation following the long but swift
battle down the Peninsula as experienced
by a subaltern of the King’s Shropshire
Light Infantry, with some incidental
pictures of the Australians in action,

particularly in the Simpang Rengan
battle, which the British know as the
battle of Namazie Estate.
This was Lt-Colonel Galleghan’s
battle, in which his 2/30th, in reserve,
having detected a move by the Japanese
to outflank the brigade and reach the
road behind it, charged with the bayonet
and drove the Japanese force back in
something approaching a rout.
Mr Russell-Roberts shows a fairness
rarely shown by outsiders when discuss-
ing the performances of Australian
troops. He refers to the “ugly things”
said about some Australians, but adds
that the few who were the subject of
them may well have been the “untrained
and undisciplined forces thrown in to
Singapore at the last minute”. And apart
from the performance at Namazie of the
2/30th, he declares that such stories of
disgrace “should never have been allowed
to detract from the fighting qualities of
most of the Bth Australian Division in
Malaya”. He adds that “probably the
highlight of the whole campaign was the
fighting of the Australian troops in the
withdrawal from Bakri on the Muar
Road when their commander, Lt-Colonel
Anderson, won a well-deserved VC.
It is curious to note in Mr Russell-
Roberts’s book another instance of the
change of climate which is taking place
round the story of Singapore. “An atmo-
sphere is developing in which many
writers, now that the story is coming
into proper perspective, are veering to
the opinions which I more than once
expressed when condemnation of every-
thing our own side did was at its most
hysterical phase, that the Japanese with
their overwhelming advantages of initi-
ative and dominating force, and suitable
equipment, present in the field and
accessibly adjacent, put up a poor show
and fought a hesitant campaign which
gave their command little ground for
pride.
Tramps
By CHRISTOPHER KOCH
The Flag. Robert Shaw. Chatto and Windus.
265. 6d.
Robert Shaw’s new novel is the first of
a projected trilogy entitled “The Cure of
Souls”. Shaw an unusual combination
of writer and actor (he played the killer
in “From Russia with Love”) —is im-
mediately impressive not only because
his writing is both professional and virile
but because one senses he enjoys it. The
setting is East Anglia, and there is a very
English pleasure in catching the qualities
of landscape and weather and the oddi-
ties of rural personality, to which few
readers could fail to respond; without
being derivative, it is in the tradition of
Borrow.
There is a certain element in Mr
Shaw’s style which is derivative however,
and which did not succeed for me. This
element occurs in passages which seem to
derive from D. H. Lawrence (there is an
odd echo of Patrick White as well, but
only I think because White owes Law-
rence the same debt), where the inten-
tion is to penetrate emotional relation-
ships. This sort of thing: “He knew this
woman ... he knew her as well as he
could. She too stood still. She seemed
intensely alive. Her eyes were so bright
looking down the dark avenue between.
Calvin thought the church was growing
larger; it turned itself into a cathedral.”
No one is free of influences; but Law-
rence is one of those writers whose
genius is too much itself to be imitated.
His way of saying things, especially his
moments of naked apprehension of the
communication between men and women,
are as personal as a tone of voice. When
another’s tone of voice is taken on we
suspect some central faltering. Mr Shaw
has been called a novelist of the highest
class, and it’s in judging him at that
level that I doubt his final originality of
vision; this does not prevent his book
from being enjoyed for some thoroughly
good writing.
To be completely in sympathy with the
story, though, and to identify oneself
with its hero, John Calvin, a Christian
Socialist vicar of the 19205, it is pretty
necessary to be in sympathy with the
traditional outlook of the extreme mili-
tant Left wing in Britain. Calvin is a
paragon of radical virtue and rude
strength (he is an ex-miner) whose sim-
plicity and sincerity are supposed to
plead for him trumpet-tongued. For
some readers they may do; but since I
regarded him instead as politically mis-
guided, I found him absurd and his
mission left me cold. This was to bring
what he calls Christian Communism to
his parish and thence to the world.
“Jesus,” he thunders in his little church,
“would have been on the side of Com-
munism.”
Meanwhile, a penniless old man from
Calvin’s former parish is making his way
across country on a mission; he carries
a red flag he made himself, to hoist in
Calvin’s new church. He is accompanied
by a pregnant, outcast girl and various
tramps. When the flag is hoisted in the
church, Fascist forces precipitate an end-
ing whose tragedy I found uneasily close
to contrivance and melodrama.
Shaw is at his best with characters
such as the tramps, and with the grim
night of the doss-house; the aching
underlife of England. The tramps are
wonderfully funny, and his writing of
them and of the old flag-bearer has true
vigor. There is a superb farcical figure of
evil, a foul-mouthed Welsh pavement
artist called The Screever, who malicious-
ly dogs the company across country like
a modern hobgoblin. “Did you think
you’d got rid of me then? That’s not tea
you’re drinking, that’s piss. I’m an artist.
You’re a load of bastard beggars. I’m a
cartoonist.”


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Which Way Britain?
TAespite Britain’s adverse trade figures
and the general setback in stock
market prices, the £ sterling has remained
relatively steady. The general opinion in
Europe is that there is no need for alarm
while the US continues to display a
determination to back sterling.
There is an obvious self-interest invol-
ved, of course, but it remains to be seen
how far the US will go in supporting
sterling.
The Americans are becoming more
vocal about the need for a radical over-
haul of the British economy, so Mr James
Callaghan, Britain’s Chancellor of the
Exchequer, will receive some curly ques-
tions to deal with in his Washington talks.
If the solution is that Britain must re-
strict imports and get her balance of pay-
ments moving healthily in the right direc-
tion, it may be only a temporary expedient
because Britain, above all, is a trading
nation which relies’ heavily on overseas
investment. The present trend to curb
overseas investment, plus a restraint on
imports, may make the balance of pay-
ments look prettier. But if it becomes a
permanent policy, sterling must suffer
internally as Britain endures an extension
of the leukemia which already has re-
duced her from a first-class nation to a
second-class nation.
Against this background, some pre-
dict that Britain's only solution is to
achieve membership in the Common
Market.
As an alternative to this, the US may
prefer to stimulate more trade with
Britain, notably by the granting of de-
fence contracts in Britain (electronic
equipment, naval craft). Such a develop-
ment would need to have strings attached,
since the US would require some assur-
ances of restraints on the balance of
payments as well as a brake on socialistic
tendencies. Nationalisation of steel, for
example, is not an endearing way to win
friends unless it means that UK steel
prices itself out of the market and paves
the way for US exports.
On the financial side, Uncle Sam’s
restrictions on capital outflow and the
request for increased remittances by over-
seas corporations are having an effect on
the UK balance of payments. Barring re-
newed pressures, there is no doubt that
Britain can meet her short-term commit-
ments with the existing 750 million dollar
swap arrangement with the US Federal
Reserve Board, the 1400 million dollars
from the International Monetary Fund
and the 250 million dollars credit from
the Export-Import Bank.
In the long term, however, without
some expansion of trade and overseas in-
come, Britain will be hard put to stop
the erosion of funds. Which way, then?
The Common Market or the US and
under what terms?
Regular Injections
fJCiERE is no doubting the US Admini-
stration’s determination to keep the
boom going in America. Tax cuts have
been the regular prescription to keep
money in circulation and there should be
no gainsaying that the American tax-
payer is receiving special attention.
Following two recent reductions in in-
come tax (including the special deprecia-
tion concession to industry), President
Johnson late in June cancelled 1.75 bil-
lion dollars worth of excise taxes in a
bid to stimulate public spending.
The new law repeals a total of 4.7 bil-
lion dollars in excise taxes, but is being
introduced in stages. The second booster
will ignite next January.
This gives industry planners the assur-
ance of another lift to the economy in six
months. Is it any wonder that LBJ’s
official advisers say they can see no
problems on the horizon for 1965?
JAMES CALLAGHAN
It is a further confirmation that the
Administration, conscious of the key
role now played in world affairs by the
US, is determined that government mea-
sures will be applied wherever possible to
keep ol’ man prosperity rollin’ along.
In case the critics suggest that LBJ
must soon run out of tax cuts, economists
will rush forward to point out that the
further expansion in sales and production
engendered by the latest tax cuts can
only gather more taxes for the Govern-
ment.
At a time when President Johnson is
removing “onerous taxes”, Australia is
anticipating a rise in taxes on consumer
spending, including excise taxes on items
British and American Share Markets
rpHE pall over many of the world’s
A principal share markets gave little
sign of lifting last week. However
real or not, the prevailing uncertainties
hovering about international trade
and liquidity look likely to determine
a wide range of share dealings for
some time-to come.
Attempts to whistle up better and
more confident economic atmospheres
in London and New York have met
with hardly any success. Both ex-
changes finished up by touching fresh
1965 lows, New York actually hitting
its heaviest loss in almost two years.
London still suffers a multitude of
fairly small declines over greatly
reduced volumes. Institutional interest
has become rather more common, yet
is hardly enough to stir other in-
vestors. Early effects of the Govern-
ment’s credit squeeze and other
deflationary moves are beginning to
overhang the market with a vengeance.
Government and industry continue
to be at odds on the corporation tax,
so prominent industrials again reflect
the general retreat. The falls are
spread throughout engineerings, steels,
building and construction, and elec-
tricals, with the international com-
panies also combining the knock from
Wall Street.
There, despite assurances of lively
and continuous business progress, the
price drift goes on albeit in con-
spicuously slow trading. Volumes,
indeed, dropped nearly nine million
over the week and were even one
million below the corresponding week
last year.
Once more the big industrials are
losing with the rest. Motors and steels
droop in the face of a very high rate
of steel usage and visibly good car
sales. Many analysts indicate the
market should not be exhibiting over-
sensitivity in such a sound economy.


like beer, cigarettes, etc., so as to meet
the heavy increase in Government liabi-
lities this year, including a vastly in-
creased defence commitment.
The only obvious alternative at this
stage is if the Australian Government
can spend less and if private industry
can get out and sell more goods over-
seas to offset the falling balance of pay-
ments. Exporters might need some
special incentives here, particularly the
primary producers who have been hard
hit by the drought.
Two-Way Traffic
TI/hile the Treasury’s new White Paper
” (which demands more detailed com-
ment later) was speculating upon 1965-
66’s chances of capital inflow for the
Australian economy, it was interesting
to hear the Minister for Trade, Mr J.
McEwen, advocating more local atten-
tion to investment in developing coun-
tries, especially in Australia’s nearer
neighbors.
The White Paper certainly feels that
immediate overseas capital possibilities,
to fertilise our necessary inflow, “are
about as vague as can be”. Yet Mr
McEwen’s general case stands: “Aus-
tralia, though itself a ‘capital-hungry’
country, has a lot to gain by investing
in developing nations.”
Speaking to the Australian Institute
of International Affairs, he pointed out
that such nations, now attempting io
move along the road of industrialisation,
can justifiably look towards Australia
for both capital and technical know-
how. These demands could permit Aus-
tralia to establish proper foundations for
its long-term commercial interests which
were quite consistent with its own capital
needs.
Mr McEwen carefully, and correctly,
qualified his argument: “Australia can-
not be prodigal in its approach to invest-
ment overseas. The development of
policies must constantly take into account
the need to ensure that the direct impact
on the current foreign exchange position
is offset by compensating longer-term
benefits ... By benefits, it is not enough
to think in terms only of dividends
there needs to be the prospect of foreign
exchange earnings on a much broader
base.”
That kind of programme naturally
leads more in the direction of joint
ventures abroad than of attempting to
form wholly-owned overseas subsidiaries.
Reserve Bank policy, too, approves of
investments fitting in with these overall
principles.
ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Treasurer Failing Into
An Old Trap
Harking back to horror Budget
T iquidity, in more senses than one, is
at a premium on Australia’s various
economic fronts. In the monetary con-
text, as in the meteorological, the swings
can be abrupt. It seems only yesterday
that the main concern of monetary policy
was to prevent the torrent swirling into
speculative channels and pressing on the
ramparts of stability. The Reserve Bank
devoted the whole of the introduction of
its last annual report, issued only nine
months ago, to the problems facing the
economy from overspill.
In that report, Dr Coombs gave the
impression he’d been working overtime
to contain liquidity in face of rising
overseas reserves, making the point that
the large increase in reserves “was an
unusual experience in a year of domestic
expansion” and adding that “although
it was of course very welcome on general
grounds it aggravated the problems of
monetary management by adding to the
already high level of bank and public
liquidity”.
He is having no trouble on that score
this year. Indeed, with reserves down
from £854 million last June to under
£7OO million, the authorities have had
the drain working for them. Not only
has it put them more in control of the
credit base, but it has also provided a
bigger cushion of imports to act as a
buffer to inflationary pressures, thus
DR H. C. COOMBS
mitigating the upward movement of
prices which is fairly critical for the
successful implementation of interest rate
policy.
Also.working in favor of Dr Coombs’
containment efforts has been what might
be called the Federal Treasury’s own
squeeze on general liquidity, which Mr
Hawke threw into the wage - fixing
machinery to great effect in the recent
basic wage case. This is the most
pertinent cause of the credit drought
as seen by commercial users. But Dr
Coombs, who has had to condone a
massive upsurge in trading bank lending
for this quarter of the year to help soften
its impact on employment, is obviously
not at all happy about the result for the
credit situation. It must be patently
clear to him that, while the Treasury
squeeze will end this month, the leap in
bank advances is only the first of a
series which in the coming months will
inject further big amounts of credit into
the system from the trading banks.
He is understandably very perturbed
that, for the moment anyway, the
Reserve Bank’s intention to keep bank
advances and the extension of new over-
draft limits in check is being thwarted
by the trading banks. The latter have
been under heavy pressure from cus-
tomers these last few months and, in
their view, have done the right thing in
keeping the impecunious firms out of
trouble and, also, the whole economy
bowling along with business as usual.
If my reading is right, however, Dr
Coombs is going to keep a more than
watchful eye on trading bank advances
from now on. A much stricter instruc-
tion may be in the offing from the
Reserve Bank.
The Reserve Bank can hardly have
enjoyed the invidious role of telling the
trading banks they would have to look
after drought-stricken rural customers
without calling on it for further assistance
for their liquidity positions. At least
the Reserve Bank deserves credit for
its responsible attitude. Its action seems
justified, despite the view of some
observers that the additional creation of
credit for drought relief can be made
in isolation from the general credit
stream. The corollary for the trading
banks of Dr Coombs’ stand is that, to


accommodate additional requests for the
rural sector, somebody outside it will
have to go without.
Though the connection is more oblique
than the recent spurt in trading bank
advances, in his efforts to hold back the
credit tides probably the worst news Dr
Coombs has heard these recent weeks is
that the Federal Government is going
to lift its expenditure by £250 million
or so in the new financial year. It will
be very surprising indeed if this can be
accomplished without calling on the
Reserve Bank for substantial financing
of Treasury Bills. If this proves to be
the case, the additional credit pumped
into the system will oblige the Reserve
Bank to be even more restrictive towards
credit creation by the trading banks.
Leaving taxation aside for the moment,
the extent to which Mr Holt will have
to call on the Reserve Bank will inevit-
ably depend to a large extent on the
success of this year’s loan programme.
If the liquidity signs are being read
aright, this is going to get off to an
indifferent start. The squeeze on bank
liquidity ratios would seem to augur
poorly for a heavy contribution from
the trading banks. The lofty level of
their fixed deposits may point differently,
but the increase in these has tapered
off sharply. The savings banks are not
likely to have much available for the
coming loan. Their deposits have been
doing badly of late. The savings banks
have actually been net sellers of bonds
in some recent months. Against this, the
life offices will doubtless be enjoined to
make weight. But, in their case, higher
coupons on new note and debenture
issues like Ford’s would seem to be a
big counter attraction, even if those on
Ansett’s apparently were not. In the
present market malaise, alternative in-
vestment in equities is of debatable
attraction, though not perhaps mortgage
business at currently rising rates.
The first scene in the new loan play
will be acted out in the next week or so
when the stage is set for the next Com-
monwealth Loan. Not only will Dr
Coombs be as anxious as Sir Roland
Wilson in awaiting the result of the loan,
but both also will be preparing the decor.
If, as has been suggested by the up-
wards movement in commercial interest
rates in recent months, the rates on the
several branches of the new loan will
have to be raised quite a bit from Febru-
ary, the Reserve Bank’s presence in the
bond market will be quite forcible in
coming days. Indeed, it looks as if the
Reserve Bank has already started selling
some shortish-term issues to lever up
their yields towards the decided new
rates on the loan. The selling could be
expected to extend up through the list.
The general idea is that at least a 5£
p.c. coupon is in the making for the
longest-term bonds.
It seems that Mr Holt’s pre-Budget
mood is being influenced rather more
than is good for the country or himself
by expectations of a poor response to
the loan. In his stern predictions of
big tax increases, he has been acting
rather in the manner of Sir Arthur
Fadden, who made a barnstorming tour
of the country threatening strong taxa-
tion medicine before he actually gave
his “horror” dose in 1951-52 and in-
creased the long-term bond rate by -| p.c.
If Mr Holt has an excuse for his present
mood, it could be that the circumstances
in 1951 are, in some respects and par-
ticularly on the score of diminishing
liquidity and rising Government ex-
penditure, paralleled this year. This is
all the more reason he should beware
of falling into “Artie’s” trap.
The loan response itself may not give
a true indication of the performance on
the loan market for the rest of the year.
I would expect a respite from tight
liquidity later on in the year, though the
respite would be only temporary. The
commercial world is not expecting much
relief until the December quarter, with
another tightening by March.
' The appeal of bond rates will, in turn,
be strongly influenced by price move-
ments in the economy. These could well
prove adverse. On this score, a possible
deterioration in the real resources supply
position through, say, lower exports and
drought effects has to be seen in the
context of a sharp rise in Government
expenditure, a continuously increasing
rate of gross fixed investment and,
possibly, another increase in the basic
w'age (the Arbitration Commission’s
judgment w'as not to hand when this was
written), which would exacerbate present
dangers of cost inflation.
When Sir Arthur Fadden was faced
with a similar situation in 1951 I argued
at the time that, rather than turn to stiff
increases in taxation to bridge the gap
in the cash Budget (though in those days
this concept had not been invented for
the_ overall Government account), the
Treasurer should proceed on two lines.
One, make ruthless cuts in Government
expenditure; two, resort to more Treasury
Bill financing and certainly not be shy
of it. The Treasurer will do well if he
proceeds on these lines in 1965-66,
though, whatever he does,, he and the
economy would seem to be in for the
roughest year for quite a time.

Groping at Geneva
New deal for primary producers?
T\)R all its usefulness over the last
15 years in lowering trade barriers,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has served the industrial countries
much better than the primary producers.
True. GATT has played a part in getting
some very useful world commodity
agreements, such as for sugar and wheat.
It has also winked an eye at prolonged
periods of import restrictions, such as
Australia got away with in the 1950 s on
a most liberal interpretation of GATT’S
balance of payments escape clause. But
most of the fruits have gone to big in-
dustrial countries in the form of reduc-
tions in tariffs on factory products.
Years ago the one-sided benefits were
the subject ,of strong criticism in Aus-
tralia, which first implemented tariff cuts
under the agreement in November, 1947,
and has since made five further series
of reductions following GATT negotia-
tions. In return for these, it is officially
claimed that we have obtained tariff
concessions on a number of products of
which we are “an actual or' potential
exporter”. As these are all on manu-
factured goods, which comprise only a
small proportion of our exports (about
12V p.c. last year), it is fair that the
emphasis be placed on the potential
rather than the actual benefit of the con-
cessions to us. For, in truth, Australia
is still in its infancy as an exporter of
manufactured goods.
Australia’s threats on several earlier
occasions to leave GATT have never
been realised, for the very good reason
that we cannot afford to stand in isola-
tion from the main current of world
discussions on international trade. There
was always the possibility that, once the
main bulk of tariffs on industrial goods
were chiselled away through GATT, the
organisation would turn its attention to
primary products. What it could do for
these in the context of tariffs was never
as clear as what should be done to attack
protection of agriculture in the big in-
dustrial countries in order to redress
the balance of advantage.
As we shall see in a moment, GATT
has at last got round to tackling the
world trade problem in a more realistic


Have you tried

lately?
way by putting the primary producers’
horse where it should properly be, that
is, in front of the industrial countries’
cart and not, as hitherto, the other way
round. But it has taken an interminable
time to do so. In the interim the primary
producing countries have had to work
their way through prolonged slumps in
world commodity prices which, ironic-
ally enough, have reverberated to the dis-
advantage of the big industrial countries
themselves by the erosion of primary
producing countries’ demand for their
products.
The delay in arriving at this new
approach stems, in part at least, from
the fact that, until the last few years,
the new world has lacked a big enough
champion of its cause. It has now found
one, the United States, which has been
alerted, not by altruism so much as
blatant self-interest, to the implications
for commodity markets and prices of the
unbridled protection of agriculture in
Europe. This awareness has been grow-
ing for the last eight years, since the
Treaty of Rome was formulated, and has
intensified with every step taken by the
European Economic Community to sew
up its protection for agriculture. It may
seem rather remarkable, considering
GATT’S previous preoccupations mainly
with tariffs on industrial goods, that the
US has chosen that forum on which to
throw down the gauntlet. At any rate
Australia will not complain. Our
membership may yet pay off.
America’s fears of the effects of the
EEC on world commodity trade first
bore fruit at GATT i ' 1958, when this
body set up a committee to examine
problems of the expansion of trade in
primary commodities and obstacles to
the expansion of trade to under-developed
countries. This, however, seems to have
been little more than one of those face-
saving devices, particularly appropriate
for GATT at the time when the world
was suffering from a prolonged slump in
commodity prices. Indeed, very little
progress was made by this committee
and we had to await a much bigger gun
to be fired from Washington to shake
GATT out of its lethargy on this vital
score. This, of course, was the Trade
Expansion Bill, the forerunner of the
Kennedy Round, which now holds the
spotlight in the ring at Geneva.
The Trade Expansion Bill (which
expires in 1967, so there’s not all that
much time to lose) was President Ken-
nedy’s authority to engineer a vast
“across the board” reduction in tariffs.
It was at once an attempt to get the
tariff reductions on industrial goods in
the Common Market reflected in a much
wider arena of countries represented by
the sixty or so members of GATT, in-
cluding the massive US market itself,
SIR ALAN WESTERMAN
and to ensure the maximisation of trade
in agricultural commodities with the
Community despite its avowed intention
to galvanise protection in its enclosed
area. Lest these two objectives might
seem individually exclusive, the Ameri-
can intention was clearly stated. Its
own reciprocal tariff reductions con-
sequent on the Kennedy Round would
be dependent, as indeed would be the
actual negotiations on industrial tariff
reductions, on satisfactory agreement
being reached on agricultural com-
modities in pre-Kennedy Round negotia-
tions.
Sufficient information has filtered
through from the negotiations to show
that agricultural protection in the
European Community and Britain also
is going to prove the hardest nut for
the negotiators in GATT to crack. This
will not surprise anybody who has
followed the battle royal within the
EEC itself on the level of prices to be
established there, with West German
farmers on the one hand and the low
cost producers (of grains, for instance)
like France on the other arguing as to
the appropriate levels of farm subsidies
and the methods of calculating them.
Cutting through the intricate weave
of agricultural protection in the EEC
and the proposals it has put to the
negotiations in GATT, it seems pretty
clear that success will ultimately depend
on the weight of desire on the EEC’s
part to swap export markets in new
world countries for a considerably
bigger reduction in agricultural protection
than they are at present in mind to
sacrifice. The key commodities in which
bigger reductions would be required are
of great importance to this country since
they include most of the grains, such as
wheat, barley and maize, sugar, meat
and dairy products. The US also has
a big interest in marketing some of these
and also tobacco, another of them, in
Europe.
Of course it is not only a case of the
primary producing countries receiving a
quid pro quo from European countries
as a prelude to entering on the Kennedy
Round of tariff cuts proper. Britain, for
one, is also of singular importance as
being the world’s biggest food importer
and at the same time having very highly
protected agriculture. Indeed it is
possibly true to say that Britain has at
least as important a stake in deciding
agreements on agricultural products
which would be satisfactory to major
primary producing countries in GATT.
But with its balance of payments in a
sorry state, and not on the latest indica-
tions getting much better, that country
may well have to adopt a hand-to-mouth
policy for some time in relation to com-
modity arrangements.

Catering for Good Sports
New demands on equipment suppliers
Australia, being a sporting-minded
nation, is very demanding of its
sporting equipment suppliers at both
selling and manufacturing levels. Our
almost fanatic indulgence and respect
for sport, which nothing seems to be
able to check, is giving manufacturers
and retailers ever-increasing business;
business which never seems to be any-
thing but buoyant.
There are few original Australian
sports. Australian Rules football would
piobably head the list of games
indigenous to this country, followed only
by two-up. For all our supposed in-
genuity we are virtually slavish followers
of what happens overseas. For this
reason, and because of the large intake
of migrants, Australians are becoming
loners as far as sport is concerned.
There is no. lack of team spirit; this
is part of our make-up. But increased
spectatorship and less participation in
team sports is causing a large advance
in the sale of individualist sporting items
like guns and rifles, golf clubs, lawn
bowls, archery sets, boats and outboard
motors, skis and the like.
Three of-the most expansive fields of
sport in Australia are shooting, boating
and ski-ing. While they are not new to
this country it has only recently become
possible for the Australian to indulge
in these sports at a cost he can afford.
For sports like golf, lawn bowls, and
tennis there is a continuing demand for
the equipment but, according to those
in the sporting goods field, the growth
rate is not as strong.
Water sports, particularly, seem to
be growing at a very high rate. Today
the Australian sportsman can water-ski,
fish from power boats or merely sail, for
comparatively little outlay. Hire-pur-
chase has made it easier of course, social
status and keeping-up-with-the-Joneses
have to a certain degree necessitated it,
but, generally speaking, the upsurge in
interest in water sports has been caused
by a wish to do something different.
Perhaps a certain amount of boredom
with the more traditional sports such
as cricket and football has also been
a factor.
On the water sports side of the picture
great developments are taking place.
Swimming, naturally, is a perennial. Yet
such pastimes as fishing, water ski-ing,
skin diving and boating are becoming
increasingly well catered for. Not only
is equipment to cover all phases of water
sport available but the facilities are
growing in number. On the sales front
is leading Sydney sporting goods retailer
and wholesaler Mick Simmons Ltd. A
spokesman for the company said there
was room for expansion in the field of
water sports. Mick Simmons has
obtained permission to build a marina
at Rhodes (Sydney) on the Parramatta
River. It will moor about 450 craft.
Other facilities the marina will provide
include a “boatel”, archery fields, picnic
grounds and playing fields.
Mick Simmons has plans to extend its
activities beyond the stores it operates
in Queensland, New South Wales and
Victoria. It has in mind a “huntin’,
fishin’, shootin’ ” promotion under which
parties of 20 or so people will get to-
gether for a weekend of individual sport.
At present it is envisaged that these
parties will sleep under canvas, cook for
themselves; in other words, “go bush”.
Another sporting goods retailer, while
agreeing that the less traditional sports
are growing in popularity, said that
business was becoming increasingly
tough. “Not that business is bad, mind
you, but today every Tom, Dick and
Harry wants to get into the game. Most
of the large department stores have their
sporting goods sections and in nearly
every suburb there are blokes who sell

almost everything the sports man or
woman could need. This is making it
increasingly difficult for the city sporting
goods retailer, who in some cases is find-
ing his business going out of town.”
One suburban sports goods seller
claims there has been a decline in sales
of equipment for some sports. “Tennis
is probably the most noticeable,” he
said. “If you look round Sydney you’ll
find tennis courts are becoming, fewer
and fewer. There is still a great follow-
ing of the sport but, with less areas in
which to play it, our sales have levelled
out. I don’t expect any great increase
in the future.”
Business is good, too, on the manu-
facturing side, although one sporting
goods manufacturer said the drought
had had an adverse effect on his sales.
One of the largest manufacturers in Aus-
tralia, Dunlop, said business at present
was reasonable. Dunlop manufactures
goods and accessories for practically ail
sports.
A Dunlop spokesman said he did not
think golf was being as keenly followed
as it was a few years ago. “It is the
same for most sports. Our large migrant
intake has meant that more people than
ever before are watching instead of
partaking. Soccer is a case in point.
European migrants are following the
soccer clubs but not playing.
The spokesman said there was still a
very strong interest in tennis in the
junior age group, though it was an interest
which “wanes when they get to the
teenage years. You'll probably find that
a lot of tennis players have swung across
to golf.” Another reason for the decline
in interest in tennis in the older age
groups was “a ready availability of motor
vehicles.
“Surfing is growing tremendously in
all States and teenagers today, instead
of playing tennis, are putting their surf-
boards on top of their cars and going
down to the beach. This is one of the
reasons for the growing surfing popula-
tion in Australia.”
The Dunlop spokesman said endorsed
sporting equipment (golf clubs, for in-
stance, signed by Arnold Palmer or Peter
Thomson, two of Dunlop’s endorsees)
had a “great following. Young people,
particularly, idolise certain sportsmen
and buy the equipment they recommend”.
A spokesman for a golf club manu-
facturer, on the other hand, disagreed
with this theory. He said it could be
dangerous to build up an image of one
sportsman if afterwards he failed in his
field. “At any rate the number of com-
panies who are prepared to gamble on
building up a golfer or tennis player or
cricketer to promote sales is diminish-
ing”

Underwriters Cough Up
The failure of Ansett debentures
HPhat section of the investing public
A which chooses to place a proportion of
its cash in fixed interest securities reflect-
ed the general lack of confidence in the
long-term future of Ansett Transport
Industries by contributing only £750,000
to the group’s recently closed £4 million
debenture issue. Fortunately the com-
pany will not be left high and dry by
the lack of cash it was to be used for
expansion and to repay maturing deposit
money.
The underwriters lan Potter and
Co. and Australian United Corporation
have had to cough up the balance of
the £3 million which they guaranteed.
The other £1 million will be raised by
the company’s current one-for-ten par
issue of ordinary stock.
Shareholders now have an explanation
as to why the ratio of the issue is not
as generous as has been usual in the past.
Little did they know, until now, that the
issue was virtually an unplanned one
and a move of desperation as much as
anything else.
One can blame the failure of the issue
on a variety of reasons. However, it
would be hard to deny that the main one
was the long-term nature of the curren-
cies. They varied from 10 to 25 years.
A government change would be quite on
the cards during this period and many
circles believe that a change could put
Ansett right in the hot seat. Even if one
regards this assumption as complete non-
sense, the fact that it is widely believed
was nevertheless enough to steer in-
vestors’ money into companies with a
more accepted stable future.
The failure was to some extent a sur-
prising one, as institutions had promised
£1 million even before the issue opened.
It would be interesting to know where
Potters raised the cash necessary to ful-
fil their underwriting agreement. They
had to hand over £1,350,000 in all.

evidence last week with the news that
profits had jumped by about 40 p.c. in
the latest year to April 30. Even at
£366,000 up from £259,000 the
result seems to be conservatively stated,
as it was after a colossal lift in the tax
provision from £206,000 to £368,000.
During the year the company has
actively chased up more business in the
country areas on its own account, as
well as through the CBA, which holds
42 p.c. of its capital. The diversification
into these areas brought about a much
stronger role for agricultural finance
within the borrowing structure. In ad-
dition to these moves, the company also
expanded into leasing and secured
property lending, both of which appear
to have been entirely successful.
Of course the best news for share-
holders is the fact that the dividend rate
is to be lifted from 6f to 8 p.c. Despite
this dividend lift and despite the fact
that the result is the best since the hold-
ing company was formed in 1960-61,
shareholders must still realise that they
are still worse off than they were before
the formation of the holding company.

This company took over the existing
General Credits’ hire purchase and
finance business and merged it with
Automobile Fire, the insurance group.
Shareholders were promised dividends of
12} p.c. from the new group, which is
about what they were getting before-
hand. However, earning rate was
decimated to less than 6 p.c. in the first
year and, even with the latest result, has
only recovered to 10.5 p.c. well below
the pre-merger levels.
Dividends, of course, have never
looked like touching 12} p.c. They were
actually omitted in 1961-62. In 1962-63
and 1963-64 they were re-established at
6} p.c. The latest rate is still a long way
away from that which was promised
almost four years ago.
Cautious Kathleen
A drop in dividend from Mary Kathleen
Uranium Ltd led to sharply reduced
profits of Kathleen Investments (Aust.)
Ltd for the year to December 31. Earn-
ings fell 40.2 p.c. or £369,724 to
£549,522 for the year whilst earnings per
share slumped from ss. to 2s. 4d. and
dividend per share went from 4s. Bd. to
Is. 74d.
Kathleen Investments receives most of
its income from MKU. Dividend in 1964
paid by MKU fell from £994,900 to
£569,940 because of the cessation of its
mining operations late in 1963. Despite
the reduced income directors expect to be
able to maintain a satisfactory dividend on
capital after the distribution of tax-free
funds now held has been completed.
They say the company's major expan-
sion move in 1964 (the Moolyella tin
deposits in Western Australia) has been
working profitably. Production rate is
about 200 tons of tin concentrates a year.
New plant is expected to lift production
rate to 600 tons a year and, eventually,
800 tons a year.
Pick Of The Crop
frozen food companies are cer-
tainly churning out the benefits to
shareholders. The latest is Melbourne-
based Piet Ltd, currently in its first finan-
cial year on the public lists. The group
plans to raise £lBO,OOO through a three-
for-10 issue of ss. shares at a premium
of ss. each. Shareholders should make
handsome capital benefits once post-issue
prices pick up. When the move was an-
nounced, the shares were fetching about
15s. on the market.
This price had already allowed for the
issue to a certain extent. Shareholders
were told at last year’s annual meeting

that an issue would be made some time
in 1965. In all, £400,000 was needed for
the combined move to new premises and
the increase in processing capacity. Last
March, £200,000 was raised through the
placement of unsecured notes with three
life companies. Despite the heady success
of the group, directors are avoiding the
dangers of over-capitalisation by estab-
lishing a balance between equity and
loan capital.
Directors expect to maintain the pre-
dicted 15 p.c. dividend rate on the higher
capital. This should not be very difficult.
The 1963-64 result was equal to more
than 28 p.c. on capital and profit has been
rising in the current year despite adverse
seasonal factors. The success of the cur-
rent expansion project and the advent of
better seasonal conditions in future years
should continue to boost profits to quite
high levels, thus bringing further issues to
shareholders.
CRA’s Coal Sale
A CRA subsidiary, Rio Tinto Collieries
Pty Ltd, has sold its Burragorang
Valley coal mines operating subsidiaries
to the D. K. Ludwig group, making it
one of the largest coal mining groups in
NSW.
Purchase price was not disclosed but
is believed to be in excess of the £BOO,OOO
Rio Tinto paid when it acquired the mines
late in 1961. The purchase includes
the coal interests of Rio Tinto at Lithgow.
According to CRA’s chairman, Sir Mau-
rice Mawby, who announced the sale,
production of all the interests the Lud-
wig group has purchased in this latest
sale, last year totalled 925,000 tons.
Last February Ludwig paid about £5l
million for the Placer coal mining
interests. Most of the Placer mines were
in the Burragorang Valley but purchase
included an open-cut mine on the Mus-
wellbrook field.
Sir Maurice said the sale of Rio
Tinto’s coal mining interest was to “adjust
CRA’s interests in the diverse mining
and industrial operations which the com-
pany is now handling.” CRA will retain
an interest in ooal mining through Kembla
Coal and Coke Pty Ltd, 50 p.c. owned
through Broken Hill Associated Smelters
Pty Ltd.

the
on capital increased during the year to
March 31 by a premium share issue.
This is the first dividend lift for some
time and, coming on top of the share
issue, is not really very hard to take.
Just as important, as far as the future
is concerned, is the fact that profits seem
to be in the midst of a sharp upward
swing. Earning rate on higher average
capital for the latest year rose from 24 4
p.c. to 27.2 p.c. Taking the profit in
straight-out figures, the jump was quite
a substantial one from £67,000 to
£Bl,OOO.
The result is the fourth successive rise
scored by the group. Minimum earning
rate since listing in 1954-55 has been
17.4 p.c. The outlook for 1965-66 is
excellent. Marfieet recently gained more
than half of a £1 million contract to
supply dredging equipment to the State
Electricity Commission of Victoria.
Growing Tooth
Cydney brewer Tooth and Co. Ltd is
selling more and expanding further,
shareholders were told at the annual
general meeting. Chairman Mr R. J.
Vicars said sales since March 31, Tooth’s
balance date, had shown an increase over
the previous corresponding period.
He said the company is in the process
ot providing the facilities required to
meet further expansion. At the com-
pany’s Kent (Sydney) brewery the empty-
bottle-handling facilities are being ex-
tended and more storage space is being
provided for stocks. This has involved
the company in heavy rebuilding and
plant commitments, Mr Vicars said.
At the Waverley brewery further
extensive works are being carried out.
Reckitt’s property (which adjoins the
Waverley brew'ery in Sydney) has been
converted to suit brewery requirements
and extra storage and handling facilities
developed. Each year, said Mr Vicars,
Tooth has to meet the cost of extensive
remodelling and renovations for some
of its properties.
Freezing Profits
Otatements made by the chairman of
Kelvinator, Mr A. L. Slade, at the
annual meeting in Adelaide last week
certainly indicate that the group is far-
ing very w'ell in the competitive field of
washing machines, refrigerators and other
electrical goods. Better, in fact, than the
results indicate. Profit, already announ-
ced, rose to a record £414,000 in the
latest year.
Mr Slade said the new “no frost” re-
frigerators had been well accepted. Ad-
ditions were being made to the range of
home freezers. Room air conditioners
saw a better year and the group had in-
creased its share of the market. The
company’s move into the automatic wash-
ing machine field has apparently been
highly successful, too, as the market per-
centage for washing machines in gen-
eral was also boosted. A new low-priced
model has just been introduced and,
with any luck, should boost the percent-
age even further.
About £170,000 is to be spent on ad-
ditions to fixed assets this year, compared
w'ith about £517,000 in 1964-65. This
was all financed internally and such will
be the case in the current year as well.
Mr Slade attributed this ability to the
heavy ploughback of profits and the tax
deductions won under the Government's
investment allou’ance scheme. His state-
ment serves to illustrate very vividly the
manner in which profits are understated.
Tax provision for the latest year was
£505.000 well above the £414,000 net
profit after tax.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Insurance Plus Other Interests
United Holdings looks very attractive
TTnited Holdings Ltd. was first listed
on the Stock Exchanges in Decem-
ber, 1960, approximately three months
after it had made a four-for-three bonus
issue to shareholders. Since that time,
a bonus issue in the ratio of one-for-eight
has become an annual feature and in
addition the dividend rate was raised in
1962 from 8 p.c. to 10 p.c. The result
has been a strong rise in dividend income
over the 4} years since listing. Assuming
that the 10 p.c. rate will be maintained
this year and there seems absolutely
no doubt that it will dividend income
will have doubled over the five - year
period, indicating a growth rate of 15
p.c. per annum compound.
The annual one-for-eight bonus would
mean that dividends would increase at
the rate of 12} p.c. per annum com-
pound without any change in the rate.
Clearly, if this rate of increase can be
maintained, the shares are worth rather
more than the 31s. 9d. that a buyer
is currently offering for them.
During 1965, and with the drop that
has occurred in the general level of
share prices, the price of United Hold-
ings shares has ranged from 375. down
to 30s. Although the last sale at the time
of writing took place at 365., the quotes
are wide at 31s. 9d. buyer and 365. seller.
Nevertheless, the investor who acquired
200 shares in 1960 would not have paid
more than 17s. for them. Even at the
lowest price of 1965 he would be show-
ing a capital profit of £3lO on his
original £l7O investment.
In the article on APA Holdings, I
drew attention to the maximum and
minimum dividend yields that had been
available from the shares over a period
of years. The similar table for United
Holdings would be as follows:
1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Minimum 4.7 2.2 2.2 2.4 2.4 2.6
Maximum 5.3 5.3 3.1 2.7 2.7 3.3
It seems fairly clear that it took about
twelve months only for the prospects to
be appreciated. Since then, the market
has decided that a dividend yield of
about 2} p.c. seems to price the shares
appropriately. If the past growth rates
are likely to be continued they would
not be paying too high a price. It will be
interesting to examine a few factors to
try to make an appraisal of these pros-
pects.
When United Holdings was formed in
1959, its aims were described as follows:
1. To acquire the share capital of the
Producers and Citizens’ Co-operative
Assurance Company Limited by
making an offer to its shareholders
to purchase their shareholdings for
cash at par, or to issue shares of
equivalent paid-up capital in United
Holdings, with the right to participate
in a new issue of shares in the ratio
of three for each ten held after
transfer.
2. To provide the capital to establish
P. and C. Insurance and Investment
Limited as a fire and general in-
surance' company.
In March, 1960, Hudson’s United
Developments Pty Ltd was formed and
United Holdings took a 50 p.c. interest
in this company. The other 50 p.c. was
taken up by George Hudson Holdings
Ltd. Then, in August, 1961, Lyndhurst
Pty Ltd was acquired and apparently
the name was changed to U.H. Invest-
ments Pty Ltd. U.H. Investments acquir-
ed Lacy Pty Ltd and a substantial hold-
ing in Point Piper Properties Pty Ltd
during the financial year ended on Octo-
ber 31, 1962. Lastly, in the 1962/63
year, the Producers and Citizens acquir-
ed a 79.4 p.c. holding in a New Zealand
company, Southern Cross Building and
Banking Society.
Tt can be seen that United Holdings has
x a number of interests. Nevertheless,
the Producers and Citizens’ Co-operative
Assurance Company remains the major
subsidiary. This may be judged to a
certain extent by the balance sheet and
profit and loss account of the parent
company, which give (with varying detail)
the asset values and the dividends receiv-
ed from these subsidiaries and the asso-
ciate company.

Hudson United Dev. 50 50 50 50 50
Unfortunately, the published accounts
do not break down the dividends receiv-
ed from subsidiaries into separate
amounts for each subsidiary, but in total
they have progressed as follows:
Year to Oct. 31, 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964

Dividends from:—
Subsidiary
companies 25,365 30,652 37,330 45,881 52,947
Associate
company 2,500 7,500 5,000
While the P. and C. Insurance and
Investment Ltd (the name has recently
been changed to P. and C. Fire and
General Insurance Company Limited)
was certainly paying increasing dividends
during the first three years of this period,
it is reasonably safe to assume that
the major contribution has come from the
Producers and Citizens’ Assurance.
Clearly, then, it becomes important
to try to establish a trend in the pro-
fits emerging from the life department
and the proportion that has been allocat-
ed to the shareholders. While the latter
is available in absolute terms, it is not
possible for me to establish a relationship
between this figure and the total profit
(or surplus) available from the life com-
pany. The profits allocated to share-
holders from the life company have
grown as follows;
1958 £ 8,663
1959 £ 8,663
1960 £25,162
1961 £27,238
1962 £27,678
1963 £31,964
1964 £53,121
This particular series is probably in-
accurate, as it seems almost certain that
prior to 1962 the figures include profits
from the accident department, which
amounted to £7644 in 1962.
The life fund itself has been growing
rapidly over the last three years • the
annual compound rate of growth is in
excess of 11 p.c. but the shareholders’
proportion of the surplus has probably
been increasing at a rate three times
greater than the rate of growth in the
life fund.
The growth in other investment in-
come appearing in the consolidated profit
and loss account has also been at a rapid
rate and presumably this is the invest-
ment income of P. and C. Fire and
General and of U.H. Investments and
Lacy. As Lacy and the holding in Point
Piper Properties were acquired during
this period, it is not possible, from the
published accounts, to estimate the
actual rate of growth during this period.
In view of these problems, only a
rough estimate of the probable future
trends in “earnings” and dividends can
be made. It seems to me that it would
not be unreasonable to assume that a
growth rate of 10 p.c. can be maintained
for at least the next five years. If this
rate of growth is accepted, then the
shares would be appropriately priced at
around 325. A 12} p.c. growth rate
would suggest to me a price of about
375. and a 15 p.c. rate a price of about
455.
With the quotes so wide at the pre-
sent time —31 s. 9d. buyer and 365.
seller—it may be difficult to acquire the
shares at the lower of the three prices
mentioned. If it should be possible, they
would be very attractive.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Easy Credit: Hard Times
Marcus Clark still groggy
Tt appears ironic that, by a twist of
fate, Marcus Clark and Co. Ltd,
which in 1962 won the award for the
most informative and best presented
balance sheet, should two years later
be brought to its knees by unexpected
bad debts totalling almost £1 million.
In fact, even after this huge slice,
there is no guarantee that the rot has
been stopped. It will take a considerable
time before the market will forgive the
slip from grace.
The company’s troubles are not
unique, for, like several other groups
which conduct a large volume of credit
retailing, fierce competition and the
pressure for sales resulted in too easy
credit with insufficient checking on cus-
tomers’ standing.
Marcus Clark’s Stock Exchange his-
tory goes back almost 60 years. During
the worst of the last depression it was
still able to show profits. Then came
last year’s debacle.
From a then record profit in 1956,
earnings during the following three years
had gradually declined. Following the
introduction of a “new look” for the
company, profit the following year
showed a strong recovery.
As part of its new image, the company
rapidly expanded its door-to-door sales
staff, stepped up its mail-order business
and generally adopted a more aggressive
approach to marketing.
The major overhaul of the group’s
activities was expected to take four years
and be virtually completed by Decem-
ber, 1964, with the natural effect on
profit of considerable non-recurring costs
and expenses falling most heavily on the
final 12 months.
However, with the new look came the
growth of bad debts. These appear to
have been an ever-growing problem,
accentuated by the credit squeeze of
1960 but not entirely due to this.
In the 1962 and 1963 years, bJfd debts
totalling £155,987 were written off, while
the provision for bad debts was in-
creased to £230,000. These write-offs
followed discovery that credit issue and
collection procedures in various of the
group’s stores were poor.
At the end of the 1963 year, directors
revised the policy on credit issue and
collection. It then became evident that,
despite the write-offs and heavy pro-
visions in the two previous years, a size-
able portion of the credit issued in
1962 and 1963 was, to say the least,
doubtful.
As a result, bad debts totalling
£245,708 were written off during the
1964 year making £401,695 in three
years, and an additional £501,200 was
provided from other reserves for doubt-
ful debts. Allied with a falling-off in
sales in the fourth quarter of the year,
the net result was that the company
showed a loss of £213,165 —its first-ever
deficit. Ordinary dividend was held at
10 p.c. by a payment from surplus profits
earned in previous years.
One thing that probably upset share-
holders more than anything else was
that, only five months earlier, the com-
pany had raised a considerable amount
of new capital by a one-for-two share
issue at a 40 p.c. premium. Capital
from this issue ranked for dividend only
from the start of the current financial
year.
The ss. shares were issued at 7s. at
a time when the company’s shares were
selling around 10s. The issue involved
2,317,166 new shares and lifted paid-up
capital to £1,332,937 in ords and
£1,097,848 in prefs. The premium raised
an' additional £231,715.
Funds were required to provide per-
manent capital and to replace short-term
deposits. In addition, the company
issued £500,000 in 6i p.c. redeemable
third preference shares to two institutions
and made a private placement of
£262,000 in unsecured notes carrying 7f
p.c. interest for 10 to 25 years.
Although the pref. shares ranked for
dividend from the 1964 year, the new
ordinary shares did not rank until the
beginning of the current year. Directors
at the time indicated that they expected
to maintain the 10 p.c. dividend on the
higher post-issue capital, which was also
increased by the conversion of unsecured
notes to ordinary shares. As these pay-
ments would require in a full year slightly
more than £250,000, the inference was
obvious that profit would show a sub-
stantial improvement over the £167,190
earned in 1963.
The only softening blow was the pay-
ment of the promised 10 p.c. dividend
out of reserves for the 1963-64 year.
Holders of the new shares got little com-
fort, as these holdings received nothing.
Despite the substantial bad debts pro-

visions made at the end of the 1964 year,
the treatment was apparently not drastic
enough. When the situation at the end
of the first half of the current year came
to be examined, it was found that an-
other £155,609 of bad debts had occurred
for which no provision had been made.
Other bad debts totalling £102,093 were
charged against the provision.
To compound the situation, trading
was difficult, with sales down, and as
a result another loss occurred. Directors
were candid enough to forecast a loss
for the full year. No interim or final
dividend was to be paid.
In a further survey of outstanding
accounts, the board decided to treat as
bad or doubtful, debts on which no pay-
ments had been made for three months
or longer. An additional £126,557 was
transferred from capital reserves. The
situation is that, to January 30 last, the
company had written off £557,304 in
bad debts over the past three and a half
years and provided £857,757 for doubt-
ful debts.
Understandably, directors expect that
action taken should result in an improve-
ment next year. Debtors at last balance
date stood at £5,217,148 and at January
30 last were up to £5,301,151.
Long-term financing is now being
handled by an outside finance group,
while Marcus Clark Acceptance is
concerned now only with short-term
business.
The blow has not been fatal. Yet the
company is still very groggy. It will take
some time to recover its former vigor
and will take even longer to regain the
confidence of shareholders and investors.
The shares are currently selling around
25., at which level existing shareholders
should be in no rush to sell. At the
same time, there is unlikely to be a
great rush of buyers except for possible
small short-term capital gains.
W. J. CRYER AND CO. LTD.
Greeting Cards
Dropped
62-year-old printing and stationery
business of W. J. Cryer and Co. Ltd
has turned in two shattering losses in
the past six years one of which was
almost equal to the paid-up capital
due largely to its activities in the greet-
ing card business. Now that this field
has been vacated, the company has a
long, slow recovery to make.
Cryer began as a partnership in 1903,
but converted to a limited liability com-
pany in 1923. Stock Exchange listing
was obtained in 1955 following an issue
of 100,000 ss. shares at ss. 3d., which
lifted paid-up capital to £160,028.
In .each of the four years between
1956 and 1959, operations were
moderately successful, with profit show-
ing a small cover for the 10 p.c. dividend
payments (except for one year when the
distribution was not covered). But 1960
saw a loss of £44,149 and no dividend
payment, due to a setback in sales of
greeting cards and the need to wrice
down stocks heavily.
Remedial steps taken appeared to be
effective, for in each of the two next
years, profit showed a strong improve-
ment, enabling restoration of dividend
distributions in 1962 with a payout of
5 p.c. However, profit slumped to a

low £4502 in 1963 and again the divi-
dend was passed.
In 1964 directors decided to vacate
the greeting card field, after 30 years
in the business, because of the poor
results from 1960 onwards and the
growth in competition from US-backed
groups. As a result, loss for the year
came out at £158,925, including
£111,339 from the writing-down of
stock. This loss was only just below
the paid-up capital of £160,277.
Reflecting the move, the parent com-
pany’s stock figure was cut from
£201,651 to £81,146, and at last balance
date was down to £54,743. Over the
same period debtors fell from £53,500
in 1963 to £35,060, last year recovering
to a healthy £56,410. Bank overdraft,
up from £117,252 in 1963 to £134,852,
was reduced to £1 13,384 last year.
During 1958 the company issued
£53,426 in 8 p.c. notes to finance ex-
pansion. These notes matured on March
1, 1964, and were converted into
ordinary shares, lifting the paid-up
capital to the present £213,703.
The effect of the elimination of the
greeting cards section was felt into the
early months of the 1964-65 year. The
retrenchment of staff and reorganisa-
tion of manufacturing produced losses
in this period. As the year progressed,
an improvement was evidenced and the
full 12 months showed a profit of £3197,
equal to 1.5 p.c. on the higher capital.
The current year appears to have
opened well, with all subsidiaries trading
profitably. Payment of a dividend may
still be several years away for the com-
pany is still carrying accumulated losses
totalling £82,207.
The company’s activities are now
confined to general printing and the
manufacture and marketing of Avery
self-adhesive labels and allied lines. The
shares are currently selling around
2s. 9d., slightly below the net assets
backing of 35., at which level on present
indications they appear fully priced.

SPECULATOR'S DIARY
Buying Low, Selling High?
Events answer the cynical critics
the years more than one person
has asked how 1 always manage to
buy at the lowest price and sell at the
highest!
As events proved, last week showed
how wrong these cynics could be. First
of all there was the call option on F. W.
Williams at 365. 6d. It was taken in
the hope that discussions with a mystery
party would succeed. My call option
must have been the signal to announce
the collapse of the talks. Immediately
the shares dropped 3s. and the option
underwriter ticked up an almost certain
profit for himself.
The other transaction which was
affected by subsequent news was the
shorting of R. and N. Statham shares.
In this case it was the announcement
of a tie-up with Alcoa. Although this
will have no effect on the immediate out-
look. the shares put on Is.
Perhaps I am deliberately goading the
cynics by buying 100 MLC shares at
70s. early in the week. By the time the
diary came to be written they were up
to 735.!
The most important event for the com-
pany was, of course, the annual general
meeting on Thursday. By the time I
arrived it was “standing room only”.
After the normal formalities, the chair-
man read his prepared address. Although
(as the chairman pointed out) only one-
sixth of last year’s profit for the parent
company came from H. G. Palmer, this
latter company deserved the most com-
ment. Because there are some 500,000
accounts in the H. G. Palmer books, the
directors still have not yet accurately
ascertained the net position of H. G.
Palmer. But they did stress that all
book debts were now subject to severe
credit tests and that the- newly created
provision for doubtful debts of £1.5
million should prove more than
adequate.
When the chairman asked whether
there were any questions, there was an
awkward silence from the packed room.
It almost looked as if he could put the
accounts to the meeting without further
ado, when one of the few women present
rose courageously to her feet. (I think
she was the same woman who led the
shareholders at the A. G. Sims meeting.)
Then, like sheep, everyone was on their
feet firing questions. One or two of the
questions were way off line, though
others, including the one on whether the
MLC would be able to maintain its
dividend this year, were most pertinent.
To me the two most noticeable points
about the H. G. Palmer 1964 accounts
were the £2 million build-up in stocks
and the £3 million increase in short-
term borrowings. Both points were
specifically mentioned and both have
been receivmg attention. Furthermore,
the inward flow of new borrowings has
been “encouraging”.
If the MLC Co. Ltd is regarded simply
as a holding company for one of the
largest assurance companies in Australia,
the dividend yield of 4.5 p.c. is
ridiculously high. So that .once the
H. G. Palmer matter settles down, the-
shares seem bound to come back in
favor.
From one end of the brokerage scale
I swung down to the other end with the
princely purchase of 200 Project De-
velopment at 2s. 11 id. Ever since the
company made its huge purchase of a
meatworks and cattle station in the West
Kimberley district at a cost of £2 million
the shares have been on the slide. Con-
sidering the very favorable world out-
look for beef, perhaps the present
depressed price is too harsh. I am sure
that this is the opinion of any large
shareholder, especially if he wants a
more respectable price by June 30.
The only sale this week was the 500
Nutt and Muddle. Although heralded
as the glamor stock of the year, it
barely made its placement price on the
morning of its debut. By the afternoon,
however, the shares had risen to my limit
of 6s. 3d.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
500 Nutt and Muddle, 6/3 £152
BOUGHT
100 MLC, 70/- £355
200 Project Development, 2/111 £3l
After these transactions I'm back to
a debit of £123.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Need for Farm Technicians
Even if they’re called managers
At the annual meeting of the Grassland
Society of Victoria recently, Sir
Samuel Wadham spoke once again on
the need for training farm managers in
Australia. This writer could not agree
more.
The need is there, definitely, and if
the emphasis is on managers, rather than
workers, then it is highly likely that
young people will agree, too. It is their
reaction which really matters, because it
is they who will be the farm managers
of the future.
When even the Beatles get an MBE,
it should be pretty obvious that young
people today are obsessed with the idea
that what you actually do in life is not
so important as the status that goes with
the job. Bank clerks are no longer with
us. All who work in banks are bankers.
Department store clerks have disappear-
ed also. Now any. male behind the
counter is a junior executive.
It doesn’t matter whose fault it is
that all this has come about, or that it
is all rather ridiculous. The fact is that
unless you have some sort of a title these
days you just do not count.
So let the farm technicians be termed
managers. If they are happy with that,
well and good. It was Sir Samuel’s
original terminology he referred to
them simply as farm workers that
caused this writer to doubt the chances
of his scheme succeeding. Now that he
has revised his thoughts, to the extent
that he is talking about farm managers,
the chances of the scheme succeeding are
immeasurably brighter.
(This writer is appalled, too, at the
MBE to the Beatles. At the same time
he is conscious of the fact that 99 per
cent of teenagers think it is wonderful.
If you cannot beat them you must join
them.)
In one way, what is being written here
about Sir Samuel’s idea is a bit cheeky.
We are all Wadham followers—everyone
who writes about Australian agropolitics,
that is. You can borrow a bit, if you like,
from those artful fellows who write for
those devilishly clever opinion and re-
view papers like the “Observer” and
“New Statesman”. But, to obtain a back-
ground of agropolitical writing in Aus-
tralia, you must come back to Wadham,,
You do not have to be as blatant about
it as some of the public relations firms,
such as Eric White’s, which must have
rewritten various chapters of “Land Uti-
lisation in Australia” (Wadham, Wilson
and Wpod) at least 500 times for various
clients (mostly in the export-action tax-
deduction field). Or, for that matter, the
Australian Wool Board and the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat, which must
have rehashed the chapter on wool’s
relationship with synthetics at least 1000
times.
You can simply give credit where
credit is due. This latest idea of Sir
Samuel’s is first rate.
Consider for a moment the position
of the young man, or woman, who is in-
terested in farming and all things pertain-
ing to farming, but who simply has not
the capital to start a farming operation of
his (or her) own. As a farm laborer the
prospects are bleak indeed. What does
it lead to? Absolutely nothing. Twenty
quid a week and keep, if he (or she) is

lucky. To get that, he usually has to have
a wife prepared to help in the house
(the one that belongs to the owner of the
property).
If the youngster can manage to get to
university, and that is the ideal of most
ambitious youngsters, the prospects are
better, though not all that better. He
might do vet. science, and after a course
as difficult as medicine he will, in all
probability, discover that a suburban cat
and dog practice pays so much better
than work in a field which would have
an important bearing on farm producti-
vity. There’s nothing wrong with doc-
toring cats and dogs in the suburbs;
yet somehow it does seem a waste of
talent.
The youngster might go for agricul-
tural science not much easier. When
he is through, he will look around for a
job and will discover that the main open-
ings will be in the State Departments of
Agriculture or the CSIRO, or one of the
Commonwealth departments. For five
to seven years he will be on £2OOO a
year, or less.
True, there is always room at the top
for the positively brilliant graduate.
Compared with medicine, or dentistry,
or engineering, the opportunities are just
not there. Yet a good bulldozer operator
can knock out £lOO a week, which is
about £5OOO a'year. A fellow contract-
ing with a header on wheat can make
about the same. Some make much more
than that.
Everyone knows how to become an
agricultural scientist. Provided you
matriculate you apply for enrolment and
enter a university. How do you become
a bulldozer operator? Unless you know
somebody already in that game the
chances a*e you will not find out. There
is just nowhere that a youngster can
go to learn the proper method of operat-
ing a bulldozer, or any other form of
modern machinery necessary to modern
farming.
Modern farming is mechanised and
the machines are becoming bigger, more
powerful, and more complicated. They
need specialist operators. As properties
become bigger, and as the margin be-
tween costs and profits narrows, the
demand for specialist operators must in-
crease. Where will they come from?
It may sound'a bit dramatic, but there
is much going on right now to suggest
that these specialist operators will have
to be imported from overseas, unless suit-
able training is provided for youngsters
in this country. In the case of some of
the cotton machinery this has already
happened.
In this country we tend to laugh at
what we term the “Mickey Mouse”
degrees of American universities. Every-
thing from hairdressing to panel-beating
carries a degree in the US. Is it really
necessary to sneer at this? These gradu-
ates perform a useful function in a com-
plex society. Everyone cannot be a doctor
or an engineer.
Sir Samuel Wadham, writing these
days from retirement, is the man who has
brought this particular problem forward.
It is one which our educators (so that’s
a horrible US word, too) might well
consider seriously.
The traditional Australian method of
training in specialist machinery operations
father to son is a fine thing. How-
ever, it will simply not provide the num-
bers of specialists necessary to make this
country develop as it can. There’s more
involved than machinery.
We will need pasture improvement
specialists, farm economics specialists,
and people capable of utilising computers
for specific farming projects. As vertical
integration increases (which it will),
there will be need for specialist techni-
cians in a wide variety of farming and
allied operations.
There will always be need for the
brilliant people in research, likewise.the
independent farm consultant or adviser.
But it is the trained man, to fill a prac-
tical job right at the production end,
who is in short supply. If Australia creat-
ed training courses in this field, there
is little doubt that many graduates of
these courses would be in demand in
overseas developing countries and that
many students from overseas countries
would want to come here to take the
courses.
It may be asked where all this is so
different from activities of the existing
agricultural colleges. There is a point
here. The existing colleges would pro-
bably be the ideal springboard. For
reasons beyond their control, though, the
existing colleges tend to serve best those
students who are already the sons of
farmers. It is all the others, without a
property to go home to, who deserve a
chance. It is because of all those others,
partly anyway, that we have these Beatles
and their imitators.

mals in the night and kill them illegally.
That is not the way it happens.
There is a whole chain of events lead-
ing to the climax of the story, which is
when Fido gulps down his cubes of
horsemeat. One youth caught some
months ago in Melbourne was stealing
stock from farms and putting them
through the auction ring, in the normal
way, at those weekly sales frequented by
legitimate slaughterhouse buyers. He had
discovered, and it is perfectly true, that
in Victoria a great many animals are
not branded these days.
The properties are better fenced, the
stock is sold younger, and the time and
cost of branding is often considered a
nuisance by the farmer. If the farmer,
or the child who owns a pony, is unable
to be at the exact sale when his stolen
animal goes through the ring the chances
of apprehending the thief are pretty
remote. The police, understandably, are
just not in a position to launch a dragnet
for lost ponies or old cows. They have
far too many problems of a really serious
nature to attend to.
It is difficult to know what can be
done about “backyard dogging”. The
ironic thing is that the ghastly trade is
dependent on the appetites of thousands
of faithful and adorable pets. How
many pet dogs and cats are there in Syd-
ney and Melbourne —a couple of million?
Sheep-stealing is not altogether in the
same category as “backyard dogging”. It,
too, is an increasing problem, according
to farmer organisations.
The Western District of Victoria, one
of the most closely settled and pasture
improved rural areas of Australia, is
having a rash of sheep-stealing, the Vic-
torian Wheat and Woolgrowers’ As-
sociation says.
This body has asked the police to in-
crease the present sheep-stealing squad,
consisting of three officers, on the
grounds that they are simply unable to
be in two places at once. Whenever the
squad goes to a particular area to in-
vestigate reports of sheep-stealing, there
are further reports of sheep being knock-
ed off in the opposite direction.
The sheep-stealers are said to operate
at night with a utility truck or a car. They
use well - trained sheepdogs and run
a mob into a corner. In a few minutes,
six or so sheep have their throats cut
and the carcasses are loaded into the
vehicle and the thief is on his way. It
is a perfectly feasible thing. The small
paddocks make tire job much easier than
would have been the case years ago.
There are cynics who make the point
that reports of sheep-stealing always
reach a peak in June just before the
income tax return is due. This, surely,
would not be too difficult to check out.
One thing which might cause doggers
and others to think twice would be
heavier penalties. As they stand, the
penalties are too light. They are relics of
the pioneering days when horse-stealing
amounted to a fellow on the track bor-
rowing an animal to cover a few miles.
No . . . they never did hang horse-
thieves in Australia, and cattle-duffers
always had a sort of Robin Hood halo.
By comparison, the present breed of
livestock thief is a miserable specimen of
humanity. He deserves to be treated as
such when he is caught.
