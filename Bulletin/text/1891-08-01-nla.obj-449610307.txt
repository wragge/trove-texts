BUCKING-HAM PARK ESTATE,
MEDLOW (Blue Mountains).
This charming Estate has its Railway Platform almost
adjoining, and its level land proves it to be eminently
adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to have
lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PARK,
"Inch is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKED
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large— from 100 up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
. The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid,
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-
prietor,

Dr. RICHARDS.
The new ELECTRICAL*, CONSULTING and
LABORATORY ROOMS being completed, Dr.
Richards will in future be pleased to welcome his
friends and patients, during his consulting hours,
at his new address,
34 COLLEGE STREET, SYDNEY.
This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS. AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated, their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with those widely recognised qualifications
combined wi.a unswerving faithfulness to hit
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN

gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation. Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes, Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains

fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
nlain wrapper, postage
FREE, A LARGE CLOTH-BOUND
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently’ without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and presen < on may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tend ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous it would be advisable for you to sit down
auietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. Ho will
on receipt of such a -letter, write you, promptly
„nd courteously, a eandid and straightforward
ononion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a Ist of carefully-pre-
nared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated?
nearly 25 000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

SATURDAY, AUGUST 1, 1891.
An Imperial Satrap.
When the first three Guelphs reigned over
Great Britain, the market for first-class
weight-carrying literary hacks was exceed-
ingly good. It was evidently a maxim with
Ministers, in those days, that Truth was
mighty and must prevail—unless a Lie were
allowed a good start. Consequently, when-
ever any big event was on, in which it was
undesirable that Truth should come in ahead,
expert literary jockeys were hired to hustle
along some rattling speedy Lies, and useful
hacks were employed to jostle Truth out of
the running. Latterly this system has
fallen out of vogue. The influence of the
newspaper iiress has overwhelmed the
pamphleteer. But apparently the people of
Australia are to be treated to a revival of the
good old system. Some time ago, Sir
Henry Parkes announced that, inasmuch
as it was most important that every citizen
should be enabled to make himself familiar
with the Federation Bill of the Convention,
he would cause twenty thousand copies of
that measure to be printed and distributed
broadcast. To this proposal no sensible man
could object. But when the actual publica-
tion made its appearance, it was discovered
to have taken an extraordinary form. From
the New South Wales Government Printing
Office was issued a pamphlet which did
indeed contain the Bill, bub with the text so
inextricably mixed up with a pamphleteer’s
gloss or commentary, that it required a
practised reader and critic to distinguish
which part is Bill and which is commentary.
No person, .however, whose attention has
once been directed to this peculiar sandwich-
ing, can fail to perceive one fact, namely :
that the business of the hired pamphleteer
has been to justify and uphold “every
letter, every comma” of the Draft Bill, and
that lie has not been mightily particular
about his methods.
* * *
No time has been lost in making running.
In the very second clause of the first chapter
occurs a provision which, if read straight,
exposes the Imperialistic tendency of the
whole Bill—
2. The Queen may, from time to time, appoint a
Governor-General, who shall be Her Majesty’s Representa-
tive in the Commonwealth, and who shall have and may
exercise in the Commonwealth durinr the Queen’s
pleasure, and subject to the provision of this Constitu-
tion, such powers and functions as the Queen may think
lit to assign to him.
Straightway the pamphleteer begins to ex-
plain copiously. “Exception has been
taken,” he remarks, “to this clause and
others referring to the Governor-General, on
the grounds that they propose to confer
* enormous’ powers on her Majesty’s repre-
sentative, such powers, indeed, as have
never been granted to any Governor in these
colonies.” The pamphleteer is surprised at
people’s stupidity in raising such complaints.
He disposes of them with graceful, and
slightly supercilious, ease. “This conten-
tion,” he airily remarks, “overlooks the fact
that, under parliamentary government, the
power nominally placed in the Governor’s
hands is really granted to the people; because
it can only be exercised by him through his
Executive, who are virtually appointed by the
electors. It follows that, by increasing the
range of power to be vested in the Governor-
General, the measure of constitutional free-
dom to be enjoyed by the people would be
proportionately enlarged.” It follows, like-
wise, that the more power you give the
Governor-General, the less he possesses, and
that if you only conferred a Dictatorship on
him, he would have to ask leave to pick his
teetli. But it doesn’t really matter what
follows The explanation which leads
happens to be dead lame. The Executive
are not “ virtually appointed by the people.”
They are not appointed by the people, either
“virtually” or vice-ually. They are to be
appointed by the Governor himself, and to
be dismissed whenever he chooses ! Here is
the clause : chap. 11. cl. 2 :
There shall be a Council to aid and advise the
Governor-General in the government of the Common-
wealth, and such Council shall be styled the Federal
Executive Council; and the persons who are to be Mem-
bers of the Council shall be, from time to time, chosen
and summoned by the Governor-General, and sworn as
Executive Councillors, and shall hold office during his
pleasure.
It is worth noting that there is not, in the
whole Bill, any stipulation requiring that
such persons need possess any particular
qualification. In order to be a member of
the proposed Senate a man must be, at least,
30 years of age, must have resided in the
Commonwealth for five years, must be a born
or naturalized subject of the Queen ; and
must be an elector of some State. For
membership of the House of Representatives
a somewhat similar qualification is required.
But to be appointed a member of the
Executive Council he need have none of
these qualifications. He may be imported
for the purpose. The Governor-General
may make up his Executive Council of
dudes sent to him for the purpose by the
Secretary of State for the Colonies. He
might place in it the British Admiral and
every one of the captains of the ships-of-war
on the Australian station.
* # *
But this, it may be urged, could never
be conceivable under what the pamphle-
teer terms “ Parliamentary Government.”
Ministers at least would be responsible to
the Legislature and “ virtually appointed by
the electors.” Not at all. Even under the
existing Constitution Ministers need not be
responsible to Parliament or “virtually
appointed by the electors.” At this very
time in N.S. Wales, Postmaster-General
O’Connor, rejected by two constituencies in
succession, is not responsible to Parliament
at all. And so it is in this new proposed
constitution for the Commonwealth. The
Governor is to appoint officers to administer
various Departments who shall hold office
during his pleasure, shall be members of the
Executive Council, and may (or may not)
hold seats in Parliament if they can get
elected. Thus, then, it is demonstrated
that not one single individual to be invested
with the powers and influence of Executive
station is required to be within the control
of the people or the Parliament of Australia!
# * *
Another obvious objection to the wording
of the clause first quoted in this article,
namely, that it embodies in the Statute
Law of the Commonwealth the Queen’s
Letters Patent and Instructions to
Governors-General, is scouted by Parkes’
pamphleteer. Such has always been the
case, he affirms, with questionable accuracy.
Besides, every power and function conferred
on the Governor-General is to be “subject to
the provisions of this Constitution.” Now,
supposing it to be true that an Australian
Governor’s instructions are equal to Statute
Law, that is assuredly a position never
realised by our people. A discovery that
such is the case would be a powerful motive
for a determined effort to sweep away so
offensive an anomaly. It cannot without
effrontery be alleged as a reason for extend-
ing and consolidating the grievance. As to
the second idea, that all powers conferred on
the Governor-General are “subject to the
provisions of this Constitution,” it is an
assumption of the most icy coolness, to put
it forward as granted that the provisions of
this Constitution furnish adequate limitation,
or any limitation at all, of the Governor-
General’s powers to be so conferred and from
time to time modified or extended.
* * *
When the draft Bill is examined with the
object of ascertaining what provisions it may
contain which would set limits to the exer-
cise of powers conferred upon the Governor-
General by the Imperial authorities, it
becomes apparent that there are not any
provisions of that nature ! This Constitution
imposes no limitations on the Governor-
General’s powers, and consequently that is
merely a delusive phrase which sets forth
that his powers shall be subject to its provi-
sions. There are numerous clauses which
confer powers on the Governor-General ;
none which confine his powers. Thus, the
first clause of chapter 11. enacts that “ The
Executive power and authority of the Com-
monwealth is vested in the Queen, and shall
be exercised by the Governor-General as the
Queen’s Representative.” The Parkes
pamphleteer gets up a wrangle with those
critics of this clause avlio have argued that it
ought to have concluded with the words
“acting by and with the advice of the
Executive Council.” Such words, he
affirms, would have been mere surplusage.
This is a sad truth, although in a sense
exactly contrary to the intent of the
hired apologist. Since the Federal Executive
Council is, as we have shown, to consist of
mere nominees and creaturesof the Governor-
General removable at his pleasure, it mat-
ters but little whether he act with their
advice or without it. Should one set of
Executive Councillors prove unmanageable,
all the Governor-General need do is to dis-
miss them and appoint others who would
concur in any course he had predetermined.
Again, it is provided in Clause 3 that “ The
provisions of this Constitution referring to
the Governor-General in Council shall be
construed as referring to the Governor-
General acting with the advice of the Federal
Executive Council.” A couple of piges of
the pamphlet are filled with arguments ex-
plaining that it is of no consequence that in
only two clauses is the term “the Governor-
General in Council ” employed. This is waste
of disputation. Since the “ Executive
Council ” is not a responsible body in any
sense whatever, the liberties of the people
are just as little protected when the Gover-
nor in Council assails them as when the
Governor deals with them on his own
account.
* * *
In this connection it may, however, be
interesting to observe what functions and
authorities are ascribed to “the Governor-
General in Council” and vvhat to “the
Governor-General.” The Governor-General
in Council may (until other provision is made
by the Parliament) appoint and remove all
officers of the Commonwealth other than
Ministers. He may exercise all powers now
vested in the Governor of a colony ; he may
appoint Judges of the Commonwealth Courts.
The Governor-General, independently of the
Executive Councils, is Commander-in-Chief
of the Military and Naval Forces of the Com-
monwealth. He may return to Parliamentany
law for such amendment as he may indicate ;
he may appoint and dismiss Ministers ; he
may depute his powers ; he may assent to,
decline, or reserve for Queen’s pleasure any
law ; he may fix the times for assembling
Parliament, may prorogue it, and may dis-
solve the House of Representatives. He
may recommend appropriations of money,
and no appropriation can be made by Parlia-
ment unless he shall first have recommended
same. And, finally, he can, as has been
already shown, exercise any other powers or
functions which the Queen may, from time to
time, confer upon him,
# * *
The foregoing summary must have made
it clear that under the proposed Constitution
for the Commonwealth of Australia, the posi-
tion of the Governor will be that of a despot
restrained only by public opinion. Consti-
tutional check there is none. All the
pamphleteering jargon about Parliamentary
Government being a safeguard, is mere
deception. Over the decrees of the Gover-
nor-General, the personnel of the Federal
Executive Council, and even the acts of the
Ministers of State, the Parliament will have
no control whatever. The chain of respon-
sibility is designedly disconnected where its
strongest shackles should be. Of the two
chambers of the Legislature, the Senate is to
be only indirectly connected with the people.
As for the House of Representatives, that
indeed will be in touch with the electors,
but it may pass resolutions of want of con-
fidence till its members are grey-haired
without compelling the Governor-General
to dismiss a single Minister, if he be deter-
mined to retain his discredited nominees.
A dissolution of the House by effluxion of
time will indeed give the electors an oppor-
tunity of depriving unpopular Ministers of
their seats in that body. But even such an
event would not shift them from their control
of the executive offices of the Commonwealth.
Were a Governor-General resolute to carry
on designs repugnant to Australian aspira-
tions and destructive of Australian
liberties, there would be, under this precious
Bill, absolutely no constitutional method
for controlling or resisting him. He would
not be dependent on Parliament for legal
sanctions to forward his designs, since, as
is admitted by Parkes’ scribe, the Queen’s
letters patent and instructions are to be
equally valid with statute laws.
# * *
But, it will probably be retorted, by
apologists for the Bill, this is much ado about
nothing, seeing that in many particulars the
Governors of Australian colonies are invested
with powers identical with those to which
we have directed attention, and that no
abuse of these powers is on record. This
would be a fair objection, and wo propose to
deal with it. In the first place, it is very
poor philosophy to allege, when one dis-
covers that one has been living over a
volcano, that in building a new house a
crater should be chosen for its site. Although
it was not inexcusable to accept in 1855 a
Constitution in which the power of can-
celling whatever apparent concessions in the
direction of self-government was embodied,
the case is distinctly otherwise in 1891. It is
not now for detached provinces with popula-
tions of a few hundred thousands each that
a Constitution is being framed, but for a
federated continent inhabited by upwards of
four millions of people. The restraints
which were reasonably held in reserve in the
earlier Constitutions become intolerable in
the later one. Leading-strings, which are
appropriate when attached to the toddling
infant, are positively insulting when con-
nected with the vigorous adolescent.
Federated Australia is entitled to demand
that its autonomy shall be real —not sham.
To offer a pretended liberty which conceals
a latent despotism is to affront the independent
spirit of antipodean Britons.
# * *
It is more than probable that were the
Convention Bill to come into operation, its
machinery would begin to revolve with per-
fect smoothness. The Governor-General’s
instructions would be made studiously in-
offensive. He would appoint to the Federal
Executive Council men who had, by re-
peated election to the Colonial Leg'sla-
tures, received the stamp of public confi-
dence. His Ministers would be chosen from
members of the Legislatures just as they are
now ; and, on a vote of want-of-confidence
being carried against them, he would dismiss
them and send for the mover of the resolu-
tion. But in the easily-conceivable event
of projects of vital importance to the
Imperial authorities clashing with interests
of equal importanee-to Australians, the iron
hand would make itself felt under the soft
glove of superficial constitutional practice.
Were it, for example, essential to Aus-
tralians that Mongolians should be rigorously
excluded from the territory of the Common-
wealth, while it was at the same time of
deepest importance to the British Govern-
ment that nothing should occur to incline
the Chinese rulers to cultivate terms of
alliance with Russia, the latent autocracy of
the Governor-General would come into
active exercise. Or were it sought to con-
vert the Commonwealth into a British
recruiting-ground in the teeth of the refusal
of the Legislature to countenance such
a depletion of the industrial population, the
Governor-General would be master of the
situation. Every department of the Execu-
tive would be administered and controlled by
one of his own creatures. Parliament might
protest in vain. The work of enlistment
would proceed under the sanction of the con-
stituted authorities. The police, the jus-
ticiary, the military, the post and telegraph,
the treasury, the ports —even the railways,
would be controlled by persons out of the
reach of Parliamentary influence. The Aus-
tralian nation would be paralysed by the
shocks of the very Constitution it had
accepted. Only a successful revolt against
Authority entrenched in possession of all the
resources of the Commonwealth could extri-
cate the people from the invaders of their
supposed rights and liberties.
# * *
A Bill so framed is an imposition on the
people of Australia. The new Federal Con-
stitution should leave nothing which is
ostensibly conceded, as being established by
precedent and custom, to be read between
its lines. Every right and privilege which
constitutional practice has brought into
exercise should be emphatically asserted in
the text of the Bill. The Federal Constitu-
tion should be the Magna Charta of Austra-
lian rights and liberties, and it should be
made clear that any infraction of that
Charter, whether it were by the British
Sovereign or the British Parliament will
be regarded and resisted as treason against
the Australian nation.
The Colston Case.
What is, or what is not, insanity, according to
the legal signification of the term? At the
trial of William Colston, the Gippsiand
assassin, which concluded the other day in
Melbourne, the legal authorities made about
the greatest effort that has ever yet been put
forth in the law-courts of Australia, to settle
this old, vexed problem, and at the end they
seemed to be further away from a solution than
at the commencement. The criminal code,
being based on alleged Christian principles,
makes no adequate provision for the hanging of
lunatics, and, therefore, when a supposed
lunatic is in the dock on a capital charge, the
local dry bones of medicine and science are
gathered together, and they all grope in the
dark for that definition which never comes.
Some of them, it may be, are assembled in the
cause of humanity; but this seems rather
doubtful, for when the case is one of flogging,
imprisonment, or penal servitude, they are
generally absent, and the law gaily shoves the
prisoner through, be his mental state what it
may. Some, possibly, turn up in the interests
of science ; and the balance are actuated most
likely by that morbid craving after other
people’s corpses, after hearses, funerals, sudden
deaths, and bloated remains that are fished out
of rivers, which seems to be inherent in the
human race at large. But the results are
always very much the same. It is unanimously
agreed that if the prisoner is insane he should
not be hanged, and if he is not insane lieViould
be hanged. Nobody ever succeeds in describing
insanity. The witnesses lose themselves one
after another in a great waste of decom-
posed Latin, with occasional black and age-
blasted pinnacles of Greek standing up out of
the ashes of the other dead language, and swap
many different varieties of ignorance, and that
is about all. They are all struggling to define
the undefinable, and when they have all success-
fully demonstrated that, despite their learning 1
they know nothing whatever of the question, it
is relegated to a chance committee of 12 trades-
men, cheesemongers, builders, and such-like,
And thereupon these individuals rise to the
occasion, and without any knowledge or study
or information whatever, they answer the vexed
question in one act—the hangman helping them.
All the scientific men of the land may struggle
for months with a big problem, and get no
nearer the answer, but a dozen drapers or boot-
makers who want to get home to tea can settle
the same difficulty in less than a dozen minutes.
* * *
The question of insanity assumes tremendous
importance in all cases involving the capital
penalty. If an individual in the earlier and


more obscure stages of mental disease is sen-
tenced to imprisonment or penal servitude, the
chances are that he developes in course of time
into such a lunatic as can he discerned with the
naked eye, and without the aid of any classical
information or old cuneiform knowledge. His
case, in the end, settles itself, but the indi-
vidual who is hanged in the first beginnings of
his complaint is past all such development.
Therefore, when twelve jurymen who know
nothing of insanity, decide offhand, in such an
instance as that of Colston, that the accused is
altogether clothed and in his right mind, it
would be a matter of some interest to find out
if they knew what they were talking about.
When a jury declares that a prisoner is not in-
sane, in the face of a vast mass of tangled
medical testimony, and a Judge passes sentence
on the strength of that decision, it is fair to
assume that they both know what insanity is—
for if not, then they certainly are unable to tell
what is not insanity. And if they do know,
(then it is equally fair to assume that they can
perform amputations successfully, and can open
up the human inside and fool among the vitals
with lancets and other dangerous instruments
with reasonable skill, and that they are able to
distinguish the different varieties of germs, and
are learned in plagues and leprosyies, in
chemistry and botany and mysterious poisons,
that they are profoundly versed in anatomy,
■and that they know a great variety of other
mysteries. For all these things are only the
beginning of medical science, and the in-
scrutable problems of mental disease are the
further end ; and therefore if the jurymen know
nothing of these mere rudiments of knowledge
they know r less than nothing of the question
which they decide so glibly in finding Colston,
and others like him, guilty of wilful murder.
And it is safe to wager a hundred to one that
this jury did know nothing of any of these
things—that hardly one among them knew the
names of his own bones even, or the locality of
his own vitals. Yet when half a dozen
eminent doctors swore positively that the
prisoner was insane, and half a dozen more
swore, though rather less positively, that he
was not, the question was thereby left to
the unaided knowledge of the jurymen almost
as if there had been no medical testimony at all,
an d the 12 butchers and bakers and others rose
cheerfully in their panoply of ignorance, and
showed themselves 20 times more sure because
they knew nothing, than did the men who
knew just enough to know that they didn’t
know everything. If they had been 12 naked
cannibals from the burning Niger bringing in
a solid verdict that there never was and
never could be such a thing as ice, they could
hardly have been more unanimous.
# * *
Probably if they, or any other 12 jurymen,
whose verdict turned entirely on the sanity or
otherwise of the prisoner in the dock, had been
asked to give a meaning to the term madness,
they would have replied in the old, stereotyped,
meaningless phrase, that it was a derangement
of the intelligence. What the intelligence is
neither they nor the Judge nor the prosecuting
counsel could have explained. Presumably
there is such a thing, but as it can only be
judged from outward effects, and as these effects
may possibly be referred to the wrong cause,
there may be no intelligence at all. 1 he old
Spanish Inquisitors knew to a dead certainty
that there was a material devil when they saw
the first rude model of a steam-engine, but it
was proved in later years that a steam-engine
didn’t prove the existence of devil —it only
proved the existence of steam, faking the in-
telligence for granted, however, the derange-
ment simply infers that the mental faculties are
not arranged as they ought to be. And then
the question arises—how ought they to be
arranged? A lunatic is a person whose intel-
lect, in a general and uncertain way, is dif-
ferent from that of the great mass of society, or,
in other words, the intellect of the great mass
of society is different from his. The matter
may be expressed either way. He is commonly
regarded as an individual who has lost some-
thing out of the mental part of him, but what it
is that he has lost, or where it was when he had
it, or how he lost it, are all absolutely unknow-
able. He is judged in a hazy and indefinite
fashion by his actions, but no two medical
authorities are agreed as to what a lunatic
ought to do, and, if they did agree, it is ton
chances to one that he wouldn’t do it. Also,
most of the things that a lunatic is supposed to
do are also done at times by sane members of
society, and the symptoms which he ought to
present are found scattered promiscuously
among philosophers, literary men, and scientists.
The only fact that is absolutely certain is that
insanity exists, but the finer shades of it are
beyond accurate definition by anyone save a
juryman. His idea of a maniac is an individual
who howls in an asylum, and as the prisoner
can’t be in an asylum seeing that lie is in the
dock instead, and as he isn’t allowed to howl,
for the police would stop him in the middle of
his top-note, even if they had to kill him to do
it, the average jui’y never has any difficulty in
corning to a decision. And they always decide
for the hangman. #
The one unique feature about the Colston
case was that there was nothing whatever to
be decided except the abstruse question of the
prisoner’s mental condition. He pleaded
guilty, and acknowledged his crime with
fatuous self-complacency. Therefore, the
twelve bakers and clerks and ironmongers and
were summoned for no other purpose
/save to decide the most fathomless question in
medical science. If the respectable pastrycook
who acted as foreman of this body had been
appointed to amputate a leg, or to form an un-
biassed opinion about the origin of old Egyptian
learning, or to be Government astronomer, the
soul-wrecking folly of the situation would not
have been one-tenth so complete. Apart from
this, however, there was no particular differ-
■ ence between this case and a hundred others.
The jurors were blandly requested to state in
their verdict whether the prisoner knew the
full meaning of his act, just as they might have
been requested to state if the people who lived
before the old red sandstone period ever bought
time-payment furniture ; and they promptly
answered that he did. If they had been asked
instead to decide, out of their own unaided
intelligence, whether John Smith, of 1 hursday
Island, knew the exact date of the fall of
Carchemish they might possibly have hesitated.
There is something stupendous about the spec-
tacle of a presumably sane judge asking a pre-
sumably sane jury to state positively that a
man, whom neither of them ever saw before,
knows a thing which all the world put together
does not know, but the event is of constant
occurrence and excites hardly any comment.
* * *
The science that deals with the mysteries of
the human mind is still in its infancy, and its
professors are only beginning to know the
awful vastness of the problems which they do
not know, and which they have yet to learn.
In the olden days the physician knew every-
thing by reason of his ignorance ; he operated
on the things he understood by means of an
axe and a saw, or with a huge blue pill; and
the things which he did not understand were
disposed of by the hangman on the general
ground that they arose somehow from the devil.
And the modern juryman, taken by chance
from the partially-educated masses, and set
down to give a brief and definite answer to the
question which is as yet unanswerable, is in
exactly the same situation as the brutal and
ignorant charlatans, witch-finders, or exter-
minators of heretics in the past. He thinks
that he is learned because he lives in the midst
of learning, but in reality he knows no more
than did many of his aboriginal ancestors. He
is supposed to be enlightened because he was
born in the age of steam and iron, of telegraphs
and telephones, of gunpowder and strange
explosives, of astronomical discoveries, and
great chemical experiments, and sanitary science
and abundant literature ; but in most cases he
merely resides among those things as a cow
might do, understanding no more about their
methods and causes than did the bigots who
used to burn inventors for being in league with
the Powers of Darkness. He has grown accus-
tomed to wonders and is too inert for wonder-
ment, and therein lies all the difference. And
because he knows nothing of the things which
can be learned by any person of ordinary intelli-
gence, he undertakes to know by instinct the
things which no learning has ever yet fathomed,
and to hang other men by virtue of his know-
ledge. Mental science as yet is practically non-
existent. Such arts as phrenology, hypnotism,
clairvoyance and thought - transference, are
merely the first beginnings of an effort to pry
into the mystery of human intelligence, and it
is safe to aver that the ordinary citizen knows
nothing even of them. They would be of little
use to him if he did, except to reveal to him
the vastness of his own ignorance ; but he
doesn’t want to know his ignorance. It is
simpler and more expeditious to asphyxiate the
unsolvable problem than to investigate it, and,
besides, he isn’t even aware that there is a
problem.
• * *
Such a case as that of Colston is an un-
answerable argument against capital punish-
ment. When a dozen able physicians, after six
months’ study of the prisoner’s mental condi-
tion, were utterly unable to decide whether he
was or was not a responsible being, it is nothing
but hard lying to profess that a dozen casual
citizens, fished at random out of shops and
bakehouses, could settle the problem in three
days’ investigation, and it is nothing else than
murder to execute any individual by reason of
their decision. Yet in every case, which hinges
on a question of sanity, the decision is arrived
at in precisely the same fashion. Colston may
be a murderer in the legal acceptation of the
term, but it is beyond human possibility that
the jury could know whether he is or is not.
There is abundant reason to keep such an indi-
vidual in life-long confinement, because if he is
not insane he is an assassin, and if he is not an
assassin then he is too dangerous to be at large.
But the mistakes made by the gallows are
hopeless and irreparable, and no court has a
right to do an act which admits of no revoca-
tion, unless error is absolutely impossible.
And when the tribunal which decides the
question of life and death is avowedly as
ignorant of the subject under discussion as a
jury of monkeys would be concerning a problem
of the binomial theorem, the farce becomes too
pitiable for expression.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Jury-box Logic.
Any casual reader of this paragraph may be
hanged some day—to be more explicit, he may
be hanged any day. Therefore, he may take a
certain interest in knowing how and why he
is hanged, and by what means a presumably in-
telligent jury arrives at its conclusions. In the
case of William Colston, sentenced the other
day in Melbourne, despite the fact that various
eminent doctors swore positively to his insanity,
it transpires that one juryman out of the twelve
refused to commit himself to the murder ver-
dict. He knew nothing of complex mental
diseases, and being utterly unable to tell
whether the prisoner was crazy or not he had a
certain reluctance to hang him on account of a
juryman’s ignorance. The foreman, however,
won this dubious individual over, and being in-
terviewed in his bakehouse by a Standard
reporter, he told with asinine self-complacency
how he did it: —
“ Look here,” I said to him, “you may go away from
this place to-night, and you will take with you the fees
which a grateful country and the sheriff have given you
for your services. A big larrikin may be waiting for you
round the corner. He knows what money you have, and
is determined to have it. He knocks you down, kicks
you nearly to death, and robs you. He does everything
but kill you. He may be brought into court next week
and charged with the crime. These doctors—or some
others -may come and swear that the prisoner has
general paralysis of the something or the other, and that
he is not responsible for what he has done. The jury
believe them, and the ruffian goes scot free, while you go
to the hospital for a few months, permanently injured,
perhaps. It will be a great consolation to you and to
society to know that the man is mad, and must not be
punished.” This was the clincher, the obstinate juror
could hold out no longer ; all hands agreed that it would
be a bad precedent to give ear to such evidence.
Now this was the exact reason why the one
recalcitrant juror gave in—consequently it is
the one reason why Colston is to be hanged.
And yet the reasoning is too blindly stupid on
the face of it to impose on a black aboriginal.
It assumes, in the first place, that every larrikin
who commits highway robbery is declare*! to be
insane on the same eminent authority as
Colston ; or else, it assumes that if Colston is
saved from the gallows on the testimony of six
medical men, therefore every offender will be
released for ever afterwards without any testi-
mony at all. It is taken for granted, in fact,
that unless Colston is hanged, whether he is
insane or not, therefore all other criminals will
get off, even if their sanity is perfectly obvious.
It is also taken for granted that if Colston had
been found “not guilty” on the ground of
lunacy he would have got away “scot free,”
which is glaring idiocy, for Colston would there
and then have been started away to perpetual
confinement in an asylum. It accepts it as read
that the hypothetical larrikin who might have
kicked the hypothetical juror would want to be
found a lunatic, which is an outrage on common-
sense and an insult to any white man’s intelli-
gence, for he would only make his case worse
by so doing, and escape six months in gaol to
do ten or twenty years in Bedlam. Evidently
the whole reasoning is based on the assumption
that a criminal lunatic is invariably turned
loose on society by reason of his very lunacy.
Further, it is assumed, as a sort of side issue,
that the hanging of one man, whether done
justly or unjustly, will discourage another man
from committing assault and battery, which is
as reasonable as the theory that the kicking of
a dog to-day will make a cow behave itself next
week. In fact, there are about six inferences
in the one argument, and every one of them is
too foolish to pass muster in-a kindergarten.
But this soul-destroying ignorance fetched the
jury in one act. If The Bulletin ever gets
into a tight place it will strike for a jury of
Chinese with an aboriginal foreman. The white
variety is no good.

No Use.
The other day* the false prophet at the other
end of the cable wired out the surprising state-
ment that Wales has a soul above baccarat and
horse-racing, and that “he is desirous of
having serious work entrusted to him,” though
unhappily he can’t get it. The assertion in
itself hardly worth noticing, only by virtue
of their own inherent stupidity sundry loyal
papers have been gulled into taking it up, and
preaching a sad and soulful homily upon it.
The burden of their outpouring was just this ;
the country won’t let Wales work, and then it
slings language at him because he doesn’t work.
He can’t be a practical soldier, for he hasn’t any
military capacity, and it would be suicide to
entrust him with an army. If he goes in for
being a radical reformer he will raise Cain
among the worshippers of Property, and will
undermine the throne. If he takes violently to
religion he must either support one existing
sect and aggravate the rest, or else he must
start anew sect and aggravate the wdiole lot, and
that will also gnaw away the pillars of royalty.
He can’t be allowed to take a hand in politics,
for though he has a seat in the House of Lords,
he is only tolerated there, and the nation would
not stand royal interference in legislation.
Literature isn’t in his line, neither is Art; he
couldn’t even grind out a Journal in the
Highlands, and the horrid daubs which were
perpetrated by his father are quite beyond his
scone. If he ever had any musical taste it has
been spoilt by too much National Anthem; and,
therefore, to sum the whole situation up there
is nothing he can do but smoke and play cards,
and look out with a dull, dead intensity from
the window of a club-house, and be bald and
weary, and wish that he were dead. And just
here the question arises—what in thunder is
the good of having him at all? The whole
argument is based on the fact that there are a
large number of things he can’t do, while as for
the rest he could do them so badly that it would
be much better that he shouldn’t do them
either. And this is quoted as a solid reason
why the nation should stop complaining. It
looks a great deal more like a reason why the
nation should turn the whole Royalty business

Late English cablegrams tell us how the Cold-
stream Guards have mutinied in a body and
have forced their decision down the throats of
the authorities. This reminds us that Dilke
the other day described the British military
system as one of waste, tempered by imbe-
cility, and scathingly satirised the army’s
total disorganisation —its deficiency in artillery,
cavalry with 7831 horses to 13,414 men, &c.
He declared that England spends more money
on her land-forces than does either France or
Germany, and nearly treble as much as Russia.
Yet, he continues, “ England can put into the
field only about as many guns as a single French
artillery garrison, such as that of Clermont,
can turnout.” He tells us how little Switzer-
land and Roumania possess each about 300 guns
they “can horse and put in the field,” while
England has 112 only that it could utilise;
how, lately, at Aldershot, “ to equip four guns
for service, three batteries were disintegrated,
all these three batteries being “in the First
Army Corps, which the country is told is ready
to take the field how the coaling stations and
telegraphic centres are virtually undefended ;
how the mobilisation scheme for defending
London with 60,000 volunteers and 150 guns
only exists on paper ; and how, in general, the
British Army is a hollow, cumbrous fraud, the
plaything of girncrack peacocks and a danger-
ous and deceptive weakness to the empire.
When Australian politicians gabble torn my rot
about the colonies being defended by Britain’s
fearful might, shy Dilke at them.

Dr. Morson, who seconded, at the Sydney
meeting of the A.M.P. members, the motion
for the extension of the society’s business to
London, based his action on the proposition
that the association would obtain in England
“picked lives”—to wit, the Peerage. Con-
sidering the admirable prospects before the
Peerage and gilded loaferdom of Britain
generally of enjoying before the lapse of many
years a short shrift and a long rope, if the
English business should be confined to such
lives it will be exceedingly risky. Only a man

ments of the old countries, with all their social

shortly, and its shouting will not conduce to

Hunk of wisdom from the riianifesto of the
new “Victorian National Party ” :
In New South Wales the two great parties were so
evenly balanced that they were now at the mercy of a
third, and what had happened there would most assuredly
happen here, unless those, who had a stake in the country
had means of organisation to stop it.
The obvious moral of this is, that those who
have a stake in the country, and a lot of steak
in the stomach, must squash that sinful party
that lias the other two at its mercy. Only,
which party is to be squashed ? The Protec-
tionists and the Labour-party are so well-
balanced that the Freetraders have them at
their mercy ; and the Labour-party and the
Freetraders are just about equal, so that they
both seem to be at the mercy of the Protec-
tionists ; and the Protectionists and Freetraders
are so nearly level that the Labour-party, in
theory at least, can do what it darned well
likes with them. And the parties with the
steak seem to assume that., only two of these
bodies have any right to exist, but it doesn’t
say which two. Also, it , takes it for granted
that the other one should be squashed, but it
doesn’t explain which one.
Taking in all the seven provinces that make
up Australia, Tasmania and Maoriland, there is
a total population of less than 4,000,000. There
are seven separate Parliaments, making fourteen
Houses of Legislature in all, and when Griffith
has arranged his scheme for granting autonomy
to Northern and Central Queensland there will
be nine Parliaments, and then the Federal
Parliament will make ten, and as each of them
runs on the bi-cameral principle, there will be
twenty separate bodies, all law-making simul-
taneously. There are about 700 assorted legisla-
tors *at present, and when these other Parlia-
ments are fixed up, there will be something like
a thousand ! They are all passing new laws for
at least six months in the year —sometimes for
nine months, and several thousand lawyers and
Judges knock holes in them as fast as they are
made, and the holes have to be patched with
more laws. How many laws there are now
Heaven only knows, but some day there will be
about 40 to each inhabitant. And then the
question arises—How many laws can one human
being obey simultaneously without bursting his
crust in the process ? Also, if 1000 men spend
all their time making laws, and there are only
4.000. inhabitants to keep them, isn’t it
about time these latter were getting some more
inhabitants to keep them, or else that they were
knocking off some of the law-makers ? For it
seems to us, somehow, as if 500 legislators could
grind out enough Acts of Parliament to keep
the present Australian population going, and
that the other 500 are liable to fill the country
with more Acts than it can hold.
A Farmers’ Conference in Melbourne has,
amongst other things, discussed the question of
beer-adulteration. The practical plough-holder
doesn’t go into the science of adulterants, but
gets at the desired result by a simple short-cut
that is keenly convincing. Thus J. M‘Donald,
of Maffra, Vic. :
If we, in this province, according to Hayter, grow only
1,831,132 bushels of barley annually, and there are
20.000. gallons of beer manufactured, then, if malt and
hops only were used, more than double the quantity of
malt and hops grown here would be required to make it.
The inference being that other materials are
used—notably sugar and glucose. M ‘Donald
held that 15,975,5681b5. of sugar were used in
beer-manufacture in Victoria in one year, which
meant a waste of 31,951,1361b5. of malt —ora
loss to the farmers of £159,775 and to revenue
(in difference of duty) of £158,330. In England,
a brewer cannot legally use more than one-third
sugar in beer manufacture. In Australia,
brewers practically do as they like, and the
tanglefoot which the Gumsucker, Cornstalk,
Croweater, and Bananalander swill is often a
mysterious blend of fermented thickening,
cocculus indicus (or picrotoxine, if you want to

The Victorian Assembly has just finished
digging the same old hole that it has dug every
session for the last three years, and which it
will probably keep on digging for three years
more, seeing that the Upper House promptly
fills up the orifice every time. This is a light
and airy way of mentioning that it has passed,
for the fourth time, an ancient bill to amalga-
mate the legal professions. It provides, in a
very few words, that a barrister may be a
solicitor if he feels so inclined, and that a
solicitor may also be a barrister if he has any
desire that way. The public is thus to instruct
its own barrister direct, instead of telling its
tale of woe to a solicitor, and then paying him
to tell as much of it as he hasn’t forgotten to
the person in the fluff wig. If the barrister
undertakes a case and doesn t appear, the bill
makes him liable to be sued for any damages
that may arise, and he is also to return the ( fee
—in short, he is no longer to be a common
swindler, getting money under false pretences.
Also, the barrister is allowed to sue his client
if he has done his work, and the client refuses
to pay. The measure looks simple enough to
please anybody, but the Council settles down,
like a hunk of mud, as usual, and blocks the
way. _____________

My Hi! AH MoOUAIiINUA,
Cold and callous as one becomes a'ter a Bernhardtian
series of those Frenchy- situations' which the clergy adver-
tise so thoroughly, I really must blushingly admit that
iJarm'ont’s “Pauline Blanchard” —an original play,
staged for the very first time—is far too fervently love-
sick for a stolid community which gets tired of a heroine
who doubles up both mentally and physically because her
boy' hasn’t hugged her for a fortnight. The dressing is
all eostumo frocking. In the first scene a peasant’s dress
of blue and white, which revealed the absence of corsets
more than the usual gown draperies do ; scene 2, a bridal
robe ; scone 15, ditto, but as Pauline has just rushed
through a howling tempest, realism demands that the
hem of (hat snowy robe should be dragged a foot in mud
not spick-and-span as she wore it; scenes 5 and G, robe
de mat worn with a linsey-woolsey petticoat. Darmont
made up the untidy-looking lover A la Antony, facially,
and seemed to revel in the tragic business—the curtain
fell on him tearing a pillow to pieces with his hands and
teetli —but then all the characters shriek nnd tear their
hair, more or joss, until you experience a feeling of pro-
found astonishment when you discover that there is only-
one authorised lunatic in the piece. By the’way, Dan
O Connor was present, and there was something soothing
in his gracing a play in which a heroine snips off hubby’s
pate with a sickle.
There was a full and somewhat frocky house—a pre-
ponderance of black dresses giving a smudgy effect. A
doctor s wife looked well in cream brocade, chiffon, and
silver tinsel; Mrs. Harry M'Quade appeared in white silk
with corsage bouquet in pink roses and leaves; and
Madame Marian Burton (looking rather tired) in a feather-
bordered opera-cloak. The strange • gutnea-per-head
mixture in the V.R. enclosure (the most unfashionable
position in the house under the circumstances) tried their
hardest to look unconstrained and happy.
At “ Adrienne Lecouvrer” on 24th just, the “ knowing ”
Section dropped into their p ush chairs as the first act
was rung down because Sara B. wasn’t in it until the
second rung up. Bernhardt simply wag Adrienne. One
actress I saw essay her was so hideously slickish that one
wondered what sort of a crowd it was that applauded her
so vigorously at the wings, but in Sarah—as she stole on
study ing her part—one really saw the great actress who
was to face the Comedie audience and beat her
rival hallow. T.iore were some superb dresses in this
play- in Act 2 Sarah is costumed hla Turque, wearing a
sort of long-sleeved gaberdine in rich pink satin brocaded
in art green and crimson design, edged with brown fur
and lined with moss-green plush. Under this a dress like
a long straight coat, reaching almost to the ankle, of
paler pink satin designed in pale-green and gold and
fastened down the front with jewelled buttons ; waist
defined by two really Turkish belts ; full trousers in pale-
pink satin, her head covered with a sky-blue cap bordered
in gold ; festoons of stage diamonds glittering everywhere.
At the conclusion of Act 2 a floral tribute—looking some-
thing like the culminating point on a ten-and-sixpenny
wedding-cake—was handed up, consisting of two white
(floral) pigeans on a white stand. Act 3 revealed La
Bernhardt in a period gown, front of eau-de-nil satin
flounced with old coloured (plain English) lace flounces
caught with pink roses and eau-de-nil bows, bodice
and trailn of ivory brocade with a line design in
pick roses ; hooded mantle (which made her look
rather bunchy)in cream Spanish lace. Act 4 presented a
very gay appearance, the crowds of guests all wearing
silk attire—Madame Gilbert’s pink satin brocade, with the
white satin petticoat draped with lace and pink roses,
being simply scrumptious, and much prettier than
Bernhardt’s pale art-grey silk, with a pinky golden
pattern, the train lined with pink ; lace-flounced front,
looped with pink roses in garlands, roses round the neck,
and the puffed sleeves tied with pink ribbon.
The tearful artistic death-scene (of course, the audience
came down with hoofs and hands at the wrong moment,
and drowned the plaintive death-meanings on Maurice’s
shoulder) was played i n a pink silk, striped with silver gc wn,
the front of pale-pink covered with white striped muslin ;
frills of white lace and flounces of white chiffon, lending
an added daintiness to the poetic toilette. In the dress-
circle there wasn’t much magnificence- as the evening
was cold, opera-cloaks had it all their own weird way. I
only saw one woman who stood out, and she was a dread-
fully obese party in rose satin, covered with black lace,
large hands unwisely fitted in white kid gloves, and a
lovely diamond necklaoe. She reminded me dreadfully
of an idol. As a general rule, you know the uglier the
“ Joss” the richer the shrine.
Jeanne D’Arc, played for the second and last time at
Her Majesty’s, on 27th instant, was quite a different
sample of the Bernhardt, and I can’t say that I prefer it.
Perhaps 1 am unregenerate, but I like Sarah best as a
faulty, full-blooded nineteenth century woman, not as a
fifteenth century saint—and although she is an inspired
Joan, and acts with a sort of holy hush, still it isn’t her
most congenial part to ray idea. The dressing is quasi-
martial, except in Act 1 when a Marguoritish get-up, even
to the hanging plaits of her hair, is sported. The skirt is
of drab woollen looped through a wooden rosary over a
white jupe ; china-blue waist loosely laced over a white
blouse. In the second act the long-footed boots in soft
white kid are nice, and the war-like array generally is
effective if hardly serviceable. A white cloth kilt pinked
at the edge and split up to the waist, back and front
revealing chain armour; white tunic with sleeves figured
in red, metal girdle and hanging dagger. In this act
Iseult (Madame Mea) wears a gorgeous fete gown, the
court-train of figured pale terra-cotta velvet, the bodice
of white embroidered in gold, zone and et ceteras in
glittering paste, the bodice and train edged with white
fnr. Prince Charles, by the way, was exactly like the
Knave of Hearts. In Act S Bernhardt wears the sam e
boots and armour, the front embroidered with a medallion
of a guardian angel flanked by St. Joseph lilies. The
final stake-scene must have surprised every past or present
fire-lighter in the house, for whoever knew a flame to com-
mence on the outside of a pyre ? A soldier waved a torch
and behold the middle of the pile turned red ! Now, one
is trained up (or down) to greater realism at Her
Majesty's.
Bernhardt doesn’t wear corsets - but the ladies of her
Co. (and some of the men) do, aggressively. Madame
Gilbert goes a step beyond, and wears what looks like a
life-buoy round her hips to widen them, but, alas! the
improver goes from Dan to Beorsheba, the drawback of
hip-pads, and when you catch her sideways she looks
something like St. John’s head on a charger. The rest
looks as if cut out of wood, all sharp angles, while the trail
of the stay-'ace is over them all to the utter extinction of
natural curves. Nevertheless, some of the fair onlookers
decide that their figures are more impress''ve than Bern-
hardt’s.
There are two things local actresses may pick up from
the Bernhardt. To keep a little block of moist red paint
in the handkerchief to apply to the lips from time to
time ; and to keep white powder in ihe top of the corsage
to bo smeared over the face in agony-scenes. It is very
easily done. “Ah! despair!” (two hands clasped over
the easily-concealed powder-puff) “My chock turns pale!”
(floured hands to face, which, emerges, of course, as white
as a miller.) The other night, though, Sara B. hit herself
on the powder-puff, and out floated a betraying white
cloud.
It is always ehcrchez la femme —even over the long
Bernhardt waits. How can one expect her to he in time,
when every evening a regular besieging party of women
“process” behind and sit down in her dressing-room,
talking pigcon-French and obstructing dressing-opera-
tions? Now, I will venture to bet that if that troop of
females refrained from ambling behind, the harassed
orchestra wruldn’t have to da <apo each bar, as they must
do, to make the harmony spread evenly over the wait.
Myra Kemble dined chez Sara on 24th inst. Nothing
surprising eventuated—except that, at dessert, Bern-
hardt's pets (including the latest, a wallaby) were intro-
duced like the children in ordinary households, with the
nuts and oranges. Sara’s pet ’possum climbed into Myra’s
lap, and ate the heads off a lovely bunch of roses she wore
in her corsage. .
It may bo quite eiifamiUe, and all that sort of thing,
and (tussie may be a nice obedient boy to kiss his female
relatives “ good night ” when ho takes leave of them after
the theatre, hut regarded from a public standpoint it
doe* look passing foolish to see a grown-up young man
wildly embracing a covey of women of various ages at the
foot of the circle stairs. The other cvenifig at Her
Majesty’s there was quite a little scene—Gussie in full
war-paint doing the oscillatory trick to a mob of cousins
and aunts.
On dit that an exalted Personage wrote a letter in
French to a certain French lady the other day, and the
prized epistle hael two errors in it—one in spelling and the
other in idiom. Which reminds me of the N.Z. aide-de-
camp who spelt potatoes, in French, with one m.
Sydney has reason to clap hands over the appoint-
ment of Mons. Wiegand to the position of City organist,
and those people who wanted to offer a thousand a year
to a certain well-advertised generally semi-fuzzy old
gentleman who made the organ sound like a quantity of
tanks falling down a flight of tin steps, ought to pawn
their musical consciences at the first opportunity. Wie-
gand s organ-playing is full of thrill. Certainly there are
one or two notes in the not-yet-warmed-up instrument
which sound like a person sneezing in a fog-horn, but the
grating horrors of the thing have vanished altogether,
and now nearly all the sounds are smooth and pleasing
and full of delicious, almost unearthly, music. The new
organist is an enthusiast— o;;e secs that by his move-
ments as he plays. The cold, upright, statuesque player
may leave no musical T uncrossed, but there is seldom
any soul in his work. Miegand’s tender v ibrating cords
tremble to your very heart.
N.S.W. Pigeon, Canary, and Dog Society’s Show was
officially opened ay Lady Jersey on 23rd inst. accompanied
by scions Beatrice and Arthur, in the presence of an
invited crowd and unlimited champagne. The opening
took place in the committee-room. Lady Jersey (in
King’s crimson braided in black, black visite and bonnet)
made a rather mysterious speech, in which she accused
the lower creation of “making alarming strides,” and
wound up by “looking forward to the fact that people
would soon have to learn the language of animals”—which
I think most intelligent folks grasp already. For instance,
when I strolled among the dogs and a ferocious-looking
brute made a rush at me, I knew at once what he meant-
A pretty part of the opening was the presentation to the
Jersey children of a pair of prize canaries in fanciful
cages ; and altogether the ceremony was an entertaining
one. There were few ladies present. Apropos the
language of animals, I read the other day that an Ameri-
can naturalist, who has taken the trouble to take phono-
grams of th u -ranees of monkeys, is now able to ask a
monkey in its o.vn language whether it wants milk and to
gain a diiect response. The scientist gathers that the
monkey uses one word to express drink of all kinds.
There were nu uheKess exhibits, but though the little
go’.den can nr es and pigeons (.those with a high ruffle of
feathers looking absurdly like women with Medici collars
on—some wemen carry their heads and walk like pigeons,
if you notice wero really beautiful specimens, still all the
interest cent ed as usual round the dogs, which were
very fierce. One tan-coloured savage sprang out and
tried to nip a piece out of everybody who passed his
elevated cage, and there were several thrilling escapes ;
also a thriving dog-fight took place at intervals between
two hounds in adjacent cages and provided a great attrac-
tion. Hearing how they snorted at one another I could
scarcely believe an attendant who said they were as meek
as lambs when they were let off the chain together.
Madame Bernhardt visited the Show on Saturday, and
exhibited her pampered tyke for that afternoon only.
It is interesting to observe how neatly their vice-
regalities offend neither side. Lady Jersey smiles on one
minus George; “George” circulates round the other
minus “ Margaret,” and thus neither aggregate can crow
over the other as far as patronage goes.
There are some people who are never so happy as when
flunkeying, and, of course, the lady-scribe is the most
most willing hand at it. Her latest local flight is to
speak of (say) “ W. Snobbs, Esq., of Snobbsvifle, Potts
Point; and ‘Snobs Park,’ Bowral ’’—which is duly im-
pressive until one drives past “Snobs Park”-a board
cottage in a few acres of uncleared paddock and a visible
clothes-line at the hack. It is one thing to “keep up a
plice in the country,” and quite another to run a
recuperating “wattle and dab” shanty which ten to ens
the owner lets furnished whenever he isn't recovering in it
himself. Not that there are not dozens of mansions with
gilded gates scattered about the country, but the people
who live in them do so all the year round. The gentleman
who is so elaborately billed as “Potts Point and Bowral ”
generally has to takeoff his tall hat to squeeze through
the door of his Arcadian “seaf.” Which lucid explana-
tion makes mo feel quite myself again.
Sydney ’Varsity first annual sports, inaugurated at the
Association Ground on 22nd inst., were largely and pro-
miscuously attended by a crowd of principally school girls
—anomalous-looking “buds” in half-mast frocks and
women’s fashions (some of them wearing long cloaks to
the heel, while the frocks beneath were cut up to the
garter!), carrying on limitless flirtations with pale and
pimply school - boys, being the principal interest on
the lawn. Among the grown up portion one or
two of the costumes were very pleasing. A
pale-grey tweed with a darker line, trimmed
with vest of gold passementerie and fashionable gold
buttons, was neatest and nicest; a pretty girl wore
severely-cut dark-blue, black hat and feathers ; her pretty
companion in pale-grey with frontal border of fringe and
gimp, silver girdle and flat, grey felt hat and feathers.
A little dot of humanity in a terra-cotta greenavvay coat
was quite irresistible, which same cannot be recorded of a
blonde in blue with a waterspout outline who had torn out
her yellow locks at the back into a sort of a frizzled bob-
tail ; nor of another who had courageously slashed a
bright-blue frock with marigold-yellow. As usual, the
majority of people present never glanced at the sports
proper— only now and again there would be a small rush
of excited females against the fence, and then you knew
that a handful of athletes were sprinting after a brooch or
bangle guerdon, and their various “best” girls all
naturally felt a sort of “cupboard” interest in the
first man. By the way, the band-music was very lively—
catchy, modern airs in place of “Maritana” melodies,
which used to be one of the bores of the Association
Ground reunions.
They are saying just now that while on the voyage he
was a charming companion—provided he was strictly
sober. Bui when he wasn’t, his warmest supporters had
to confess that it didn’t sound well to hear him heating
his wife in the lonely wa'ches of the night.
Sydney Reunions held their third dance at “ Nithsdale,”
on 21st inst., which was graced by a good attendance*
and the seventeen dances wore over before midnight.
There were not many nice dresses—Miss Benson (North
Shore), in shell-pink surah; Miss Wilson, in eau de nil
silk and chiffon ; and Miss Yeend, in pale-blue and silver
embroidery, looked about the most attractive. By the
way, the matting in the vestibule would have benefited
by a little brooming. Trained dresses suffered consider-
ably.
May and judicial December are to be united in holy
matrimony some time during August. The exact date of
the sacrifice has not yet been made known. This will be
the fourth time the happy and well-gilt bridegroom has
muttered “ 1 will.” How many times he has said to him-
self “ I would I ” will probably never he known.
Lieut. Trcherne, of H.M.S. Curacoa, and Miss Marion
Campbell, of Duntroon, Queanbeyan, were married on
22nd. During the day the bridegroom’s ship was
decorated with a wreath of orange-blossoms which, how-
ever, had soon to be lowered owing to the death of a
sailor on board. It is to be hoped the happy pair are not
superstitious.
Yours affectionately,

Boxing at Liverpool, Slavin, who was
“ off-colour,” ridiculed Mitchell, and the latter, a
notoriously evil-tempered man, thereupon, taking
advantage of Slavin’s condition, floored him
several times, and finally knocked him through
the ropes. Slavin, however, returned to the
attack, but the audience, seeing the unfairness of
the affair, stopped it. Will Mitchell be game to
tackle Slavin now? Probably not; he is too good
a judge.
“ dim " (P. J.) Clark, general manager in
Australia for the Alliance Insurance Co., and
old-time amateur oarsman, is dead, to the great
grief of a thousand sincere friends scattered all
over, and far beyond, the boundaries of this con-
tinent. A large concourse gathered last Sunday
to see the last of one of the m st loveable men ever
known on land or water. Mr. Clark died of
internal cancer, against the agonies of which he
had long vainly battled.
The Parkesian decision to' retain in office
Postmaster-General O’Connor by elevating him to
the nominee N.S.W. Upper House, after he has
been twice rejected by the popular voice, is an
insult to the principle of government by the
people. The fact that there are local precedents
for so noxious a course only goes to prove that the
two political parties who have hitherto controlled
N.S.W. politics turn-about have an equal con-
tempt for the democracy.
Parkes figures most despicably in connec-
tion with the N.S.W. shearing-trouble. One day
last week he scorned the idea of sending 100
armed men to protect a Western woolshed (con-
veniently forgetting that only nine months before
he zealously sent 100 armed men to protect a
Northern coal-mine); and on the very next day
he issued a proclamation designed to cow the
shearers into abject submission to the squatters,
that is, the money-lenders of Sydney. He carried
his shuffling, shambling policy so far as to allow
the proclamation to go forth without his official
signature, hoping thus to curry favour with his
“Labour” masters. The dodge was too trans-
parent to succeed. As Parkes is charged by the
Governor with the custody of the Great Seal of
the province, the Great Seal could not have been
attached to the Parkesian proclamation without
Parkes’ cognizance and consent. He cocked a
deaf ear t > Crick’s denunciation of the illegality of
tlic “ proclamation.”

It seems that the stage-struck bloods did
not go on “extras;” “Cleopatra” being a
“costume” piece, and the supply of dressts
limited, their action deprived certain habitues of
“ Poverty Point ”of a chance to earn tucker. It
may interest these pros, to know that their rivals
looked about as graceful as geese who stand on
one leg.

After the Sydney Choral and Orchestral
Society had performed Gounod’s oratorio of
“ Tobias,” under the leadership of Mens.
Kowalski, at Sydney Centenary Hall last Friday
evening, and a miscellaneous concert, they
adjourned to the inner vestibule of the Australia
to serenade Sara Bernhardt, who, accompanied
by the faithful Seylor, Darmont, and Dr. do
Lambert, delightedly looked down from an upper-
window. The choir first sang Joncicres' “Li
Tsing,” in which Miss Col bourne Baber sang the
solo, and then Deslonis gave vent to “ Les
Rameanx and “La Marseillaise ” with a fire and
power that made the great actress clap her little
hands excitedly.
* * #
During her stay in Sydney Sara has not
disported herself so freely as in ’Frisco, where sha
visited Crernorne, had a slogging-match got up for
her special edification, and actually gave a per-
formance at a Chinese theatre, after drawing 65
cents from the treasury, on account. On this
occasion the orchestra was absent, and Sara
started the show by imitating the wheezy, halting,
jumbled wails of the Chinese instruments.; then
she danced a Chinese cachuca, and concluded the
performance by running amok among the other
performers with the two-handed sword that had
hung from the shoulder of the juvenile lead.
* * #
It is acknowledged by the cognoscenti that
“Pauline Blanchard ” only wants judicious prun-
ing to present one of the finest vehicles for the
display of Sara’s versatility in her possession. One
thine is certain—she has not done better work
than in it since arrival. For the sweet sake of the
author possibly, animated probably by the spice
of novelty, she acted like one possessed.
# * #
The pious and the puritanical continue
to advertise Sara gratuitously by attacking her in
the dailies. Their case is stronger than then-
power to handle it. As someone has put it, Sara
is a fantastic, morbid, artistic eccentricity who
habitually appears in dramas that are mostly
nightmares, and scarcely ever tries to present a
type of woman that can be seen without shame or
remembered without abhorrence. It cannot be
denied that the characters she represents are the
products of an unhealthy social condition and a
lawless, perverse ingenuity; nevertheless, her
charm of voice, of movement, of appearance,
attract the public, and there’s an end on’t. For
instance, her death as Camille; yon know that it
is merely a theatrical trick, nevertheless, when
she suddenly swings round rigidly, held by
Armand at arm’s length, your pulses leap, your
blood runs cold, and yon are carried out of
yourself.

As Adrienne Lecoavreur the genius dis-
played signs of weariness, nevertheless, her death
by poison, as a horror-provoking, blood curdling
piece of reaUsm, must be awarded the coffin-plate.
The de Saxe of Revel was better than anticipated,
the Princess of Mine. Mea, graceful, but lacking
in passion, while Munie’s Michonet was about his
best, up to date. The remainder of Her Majesty’s
season was filled up by revivals. The gallery and
upper-circle attendance has been falling off for
some time, and the best customers aloft are the
French sailors now in port.

“Flying from Justice,” weak in circle
attraction, has otherwise been paying its way at
Sydney Royal. On Thursday night it gets out of
the way of “Theodora” and the bewitching
Bernhardt, who holds the fort for nine nights
with that play, one of her very best, and revivals.
>l. 0. Williamson lias made arrangements
whereby season ticket-holders at Her Majesty’s
can exchange tickets for the dernier at one house
for the premiere at the other. Sara will be
replaced at Sydney Royal by the Opera Com-
pany, in “ The Old Guard,” on August 10.

The afternoon was a daisy on which the
Gosford steamed down the harbour to meet J.
L. Sullivan. About 150 souls - sports, journalists,
actors and managers—were on board by invitation
from Duncan B. Harrison, and the “Evangeline”
quartette, Messrs. Ure, Fitzgerald, Brown and
Edwards, sang like seraphim, while a long array
of empty bottles clinked together harmoniously
in her wake and glinted in the sunlight like mile-
stones on the way to Paradise. But Johnel came
not, and so, after steaming in and out the Heads
for hours unavailingly, Duncan 8., unwilling to
close half the theatres in town for the evening,
regretfully said “’Bout ship.” He returned,
however, accompanied by a faithful few, to pick
up the mighty ex-slugger some iiours later.

an advance of Is. over usual prices on every seat

V Evangeline,” re - invigorated by the

another Criterion fortnight at least, but Myra
Kemble, with the original cast of “Dr. Bill,” is
booked for Saturday night, sure. At the Bern-
hardt matinee Sara sent round her golden cestus
as a gift to Fortesoue, and Catherine, next act,
wore it (the “ sestos ” as a contemporary spells it)
as a garter. Sweet Evangeline skips to Brisbane
Opera House where she starts on August Bth.

It is over 20 years since the writer hut
saw Buckstone’s farce, “A Kiss in the Dark,’’
and we were glad to see an old friend so well
treated at Sydney Garrick, by “Teddy” Royce.
Maggie Knight and Charlie Brown, the other
evening. Just one point : when Mrs. Pettibone
said to Frank Fathom : “I declare you’re browner
than ever ! ” someone near us murmured, “Yes,
Charlie Browner than ever.”

T. G. Warren’s “ Nita’s First” has been
previously played locally; first at Sydney Royal in
’B5, and then at the Opera House, in ’B7. Only
put up for three nights and short of rehearsal, it
is excellently played, and was received with
yells of laughter and numerous calls on
first night. The management might wisely
leave “ Our Flat ” on tiie shelf ard run
“Nita’s-First-Kiss-in-the-Dark ” to the end of the
■season. The best-drawn characters in the farcical
comedy are the irritable old Fizzleton and his
stupid, soft-hearted wife, who simply goads him
to madness. Royce, as Irascible, annexes most of
the plauditory pastry, and is ably seconded by
Mrs. Hill, Maggie Knight, Mary Kingsley, Hans
Phillips, Lawrence Cautley, and Charlie Westma-
oott; but Edwin Kelly is cast out of his element
as the silly swell, St. George, and as Miss Prim
and Jane the Misses Mowbray and Gallagher are
somewhat overweighted. On Saturday night next
Charles Cartwright and Olga Nethersole open in
“The Profligate,” a beautiful but quiet play by
Pinero. They may revive “ The Idler ” and
“Moths,” and have, among other plays new to
Australia, Sardou’s “ Scrap of Paper,” Grundy’s
“ Village Priest,” “ Dream Faces,” &c. As sup-
port, Messrs. Poulton, Cates, Russell, and others
will augment the present company.

The appearance of “Bridget O’Brien,
Esquire,” at the Adelaide Royal, has had the
effect of nightly crowding the theatre, the business
done being remarkable. Bridget has thoroughly
established herself as a favourite, and coming so
soon after Madame Bernhardt, her French is more
generally understood than it would have been at
any prior period. All the original scenery and
gorgeous dresses are used in the production, and
the piece seems good for a long run. Vincent
West is in charge of the front of the house.
Tommy Hudson continues to gather in the dollars
at Garner’s Rooms. Felix Tanner attempts a
fast of 40 days under the management of Monty
Browne.

The re opening of Melbourne Royal on
Saturday night was rather a brilliant success until
the curtain rose. Within the short space of three
weeks the old house has renewed its lusty youth.
The stage has been extended some three yards
forward, and the auditorium, newly upholstered
and electric-lighted, is smart from floor to ceiling,
There is, perhaps, more gilt than innocence about
the place, and the tiers are apt to sparkle in one’s
eye ; also, the proscenium would make a suitable
frame for a picture of the Lord Mayor’s Show, and
the act-drop seems too modest for its gaudy
environment -but, taken altogether, the appear-
ance of the interior is highly refreshing and free
from fleas. One alteration only is for the worse.
The dress-circle floor has been raised so near to
the ceiling that a very tall man, attired in a very
high hat, couldn’t jump for joy in the corridor
without damaging his head-gear. This resort of
fashion is likely to be suffocatingly hot in the
summer time.

The initial performance of “ The Dancing
Girl ” might be summed up by the faculty as a bad
case of general paralysis of the insane. Acting
and stage management have, no doubt, improved
a little by now, but the doom of this entertain-
ment was pronounced by a disgusted audience on
Saturday night. “The DancingGirT” (as designed
by H. A. Jones) is a beautiful harlot, Drusilla
Ives, built on the lines of Miss Formosa. In Lon-
don she lives with an absurd young dock whose
<anded estate seems to consist of one of Gilbert
and Sullivan’s islands, inhabited by a pious fish-
ing population amongst whom the father of Dru-
sifla is pre-eminent. When Drusilla, garbled as
a tame Quakeress, goes down to see the old folks
at home, and tells them what a nice, steady virgin
s he is in London, the dook also arrives, and sits in
the middle of his island while the tenants ask him
to build a breakwater. Presently he returns to
the wicked world, taking with him, as private
secretary, or something, a virtuous Quaker who
has been making love to Drusilla during her
holiday on the island. The dook knows all about
ms girl’s mash, because she told him of it, and so
he encourages the fellow to come dodging round
Brasilia and himself with a faithful groan
Mien they are resuming their sinful career.
Aow, who but an author named Jones could con-
ceive such a character as that? All this time the
dook is going to the dogs in a monotonous manner,
and when he is on the verge of being sold up he
proposes to marry Drusilla—probably, because he
thinks they might pawn the jewellery he has given
her, and retire into private life on the tickets.
Drusilla is not on, however. She is the first
member of the Gaiety Company (must be Gaiety
Company, for there are no “dancing-girls,” so-
called, in any other) that ever refused to become
a duchess when the coronet was chucked at her.
After this, the dook arranges to give a grand final
flare-up in honour of Drusilla, previous to com-
mitting suicide. He gives it. Awful splendid
affair. Gorgeous staircase leading out of the
middle of a drawing-room, and heaps of supers.,
disguised as pillars of sass'.ety, shaking hands
with the dook at the bottom of the stairs. The
ball above (where all the noble guests clan
their hands and shout “Bravo!” when their
cronk hostess dances a new pas de seal) is
disturbed by the arrival of Ives pere. lie dis-
covers that ids daughter is spiritually lost, and
wants_ to take her back to the good old island.
She wisely declines. Then the aged parent curses
her-and departs, soon after which Drusilla has a
fit of remorse, or spasms, and totters off the pre-
mises. That’s the end of Tier, for the evening.
Then the dook (the guests having all cleared out,
with the exception of one lame girl who must be
going to camp in the ball-room) makes a few
remarks to a bottle of poison, and prepares to die.
The lame girl conies down the ridiculous staircase
at this juncture. Her one purpose in the play is
to limp up to the dook at odd times and tell him
that she wishes to “drag him from under the
horses’ hoofs.” She has a soft, sad, sweet expres-
sion, and her whole life is devoted to warning the
dook, and waiting for him to get under those
“hoofs.” At last she has her long-looked-for
opportunity. The bottle is almost at his lips.
In another instant the allegorical steeds will be
over him. She catches hold of the dook’s arm—he
is saved, saved ! The rest is drivel, pointing to the
probability of marriage between the dear dook
and his preserver. That this yarn should have
carried London b} 7 storm can be easily accounted
for. In the first place, dukes and dancing-girls
are indigenous to the soil, and the subject, wildly
ridiculous as it is, has an appearance of local
interest. In the second, but more important
place, the play contains several strong, though
utterly false, situations, to which accomplished
and well-placed artists would be able to give a
veneer of possibility.

Miss Laura Yilliers has brought over a
very second-rate English provincial company,
utterly incompetent to deal with a play in which
polished acting and a bong-tong manner are as
indispensable for some of the performers as power
and pathos are for others. The best of them only
walked through their parts on Saturday, a Miss
Floyd, who represented the lame girl in a quite
colourless fashion, being hoisted into the position
of a favourite simply because the house wanted to
applaud somebody. Clifton Alderson, the dook
and male “star” of the crowd, is a large,
showy, self-satisfied gentleman, who talks
like Knight Aston and resembles Charles
Warner in face and height. Miss Yilliers herself
would seem to be a lady possessed of sufficient
means to enable her to run her own show and
figure in large capitals on the playbill. It is in-
conceivable that she can have been seriously
engaged to come out here and make a fortune for
the new Royal proprietary. She lacks four essen-
tials for the name part in Jones’play. Although
evidently an experienced stage hand, she shows no
evidence of real ability as an actress. She is cer-
tainly not beautiful, she doesn’t look like a girl,
and her attempt at dancing is pathetic. She
starts to show the dook a new and beautiful leg-
shake •when they are on the island, and after the
fourth or fifth kick the virtuous Quaker admirer,
who spots his Drusilla just as ho is coming out of
a neighbouring prayer-meeting, shouts out,
“Woman, what art thou?” He might well ask
the question. Two or three others of the company
are harmless, and the balance ought to be taken
away in the dust-cart. To be continued in our
next.

Over at the Bijou ther-e was another
crowded meeting, on Saturday, in honour of
“ Dandy Dick,” and that trusty animal carried his
singed tail to victory as of yore. Sass made his
first appearance at the house in the capacity of
Major Tarver, a dyspeptic warrior who is pre-
pared to pack up a few charcoal biscuits and
toddle into the deadly bi-eech when called upon.
Also, Miss Brenda Gibson took up the pretty little
character of Sheba in a pleasing way, whilst the
heat and burden of the night was borne by the
originals. Mrs. Brough again ran riot around the
Deanery, and once more did Noah Brough, P.C.,
drag the Very Reverend Anson from under the
horse’s hoofs when he was about to give Dandy
half a pound of arsenic to cure his “ chill.” The
Brough and Boucicault trade-mark—three B’s in
a diamond—is stamped all over this performance
of Pinero’s. comedy, but its present reign
tei’minates to-night (30th). On Friday they put
up “Peril” for the first time in Australia.
“Peril” is the Bancroftian version of “Nos
Intimes,” differing from “Friends” (late of
Sydney) in sundry particulars.

“ The County Fair” pegs away feebly at
the Opera House, and there is little health in it.
People certainly seem glad to find that Sally has
lent Taggs another night-gown, because the
damsel would catch cold if she were to come
prowling downstairs in the ten inch garment she
wore before the play started. But they refuse to
take the great mechanical race at all seriously. It
makes a row like a watermill in action, and alto-
gether fails to look like an idyll of the turf.
Meanwhile, the Alexandra is monopolised by
painters and decorators. Dampier received a
cordial send-off from his patrons and a silver cigar-
case from the company and employes on Saturday.
Just now he is showing a varied assortment of
attractions round the Bendigo, Ballarat, and
Geelong districts. The Italian Opera season starts
on August Bth, and subscribers may book their
names until the day preceding the event.

Business has slowed down at Melbourne
Princess’, although the reduction in crush is not
yet sufficiently noticeable to have caused an
announcement of the second Gaiety burlesque—
“ Cinder Ellen,” A batch of “new features”
gave a flavour of novelty to “Huy Bias” on
Saturday. Of the old features, pretty Miss Levey
seems to be improving on acquaintance. Her
dancing is as light as a snowflake, and her arm
and wrist-play especially graceful. As a speaker
of lines, too, she is far more satisfactory than the
other airy fairy, Sylvia Grey, who .doesn't ,seem
to try to act as nicely as Fred. Leslie can whistle.
One or two very aged and infirm jokes have
dropped out of “Ruy Bias,” apparently. The
cold weather has mercifully parried them off,
maybe. On the other hand, a new jest fairly
shook the house on G.N. Hurdle race-night, when
Dauby observed that they must expect Crusoe to
win on a.Friday. The same stroke of wit had
flashed across Flernington a hundred times during
the afternoon, yet not one broken-up punter had
thought it the least bit brilliant. Nothing is
brilliant to the miserable sinner whose fancy has
just come to grief at the first jump, or failed to
“ stay ” home.

At the Athemeum big-hearted John
Roberts gave a magnificent performance last
Saturday afternoon and evening, when he con-
ceded 1000 in 2000 to the local billiard champion,
Harry Evans, and finished well in front. The
masterly manner in which the “ star ” took all the
shine out of a player who seems a great artist in
any other company was a treat to witness. The
Flood Fund benefited by Roberts’ first week at
the Athenaeum to the extent of £215. He had
volunteered to contribute 25 per cent, of the
takings, like a man and a brother.

The cableman, who never forgets to
advise us when Lord Tompkins catches a cold in
the nose, might have sent word to Australia that
old friend Joe Emmett died on June 16th.
Pneumonia —aided and abetted by whisky, no
doubt—carried off this clever dancer, singer,
musician, female impersonator, and finished actor,
whose talent was strong enough to carry the
silliest of pieces half round the world, and wring
money out of it for well-nigh twenty years. A
comparatively sensible play like “ Hans the
Boatman,” would have suited Emmett down to
the ground, for he was master of the school in
which Arnold picked up his education. How-
ever, “Fritz” served, in its time, to send Aus-
tralia into convulsions over the gifted J. K., and
“Schneider how you vas ” lingers in many a
middle-aged heart to this day. Fritz’s song and
dance in prison, when he put the jailer’s kid on
his shoulder, was as pathetic as Maggie Moore's
mouth-organ performance to the incarcerated
Stoefel. He could change smiles into tears with
any artist that ever played Dutch Ameri-
can parts. At the London Adelphi, then
in very low water, Emmett made more fame for
himself than money for the show, but around the
provinces he must have done great business. The
prejudice against men-females (out of pantomime)
couldn't withstand Emmett’s realistic maiden who
used to tell an apocryphal Jacob to get along and
not bother her. With a fine pair of eyes, small
feet and graceful ankles, poor old Joe looked a lot
nicer than most of the girls one sees mashing
chappies, nor were his wig and complexion a bit
more artificial. But “Fritz” was a miserable
bundle of stuff to go travelling with, all the same.
A sort of music-hall drama, haunted by a wicked
colonel in an ulster, which reminds us that ’Gustus
Glover, now of Bland Holt’s company, imper-
sonated the aforesaid evil spirit in England. It
was awesome to hear him chuck his villainy off
h’s chest, and fearful to see him roll his gloomy
eyes at the genius who so recently embarked upon
the Jasper.
Our old friend, Henry Edwards, who recently died at
New York, had been staying at the Catskills for his
health, but the physicians there, seeing that the end was
near, advised him to return to his home. A few hours
after his arrival there, while suffering great pain, he said
to his devoted wife, “ Put your arms about me, dear,”
and suddenly expired. The immediate cause of death
was dropsy of the heart. He was born in 1824 at Ross,
Herefordshire, was the son of an attorney, and was at
first intended for the law, but drifted ihto amateur
theatricals (in company with Henry Irving, then Broad-
ribb), and finally on to the professional stage. It is need-
less to say anything about his Australian career in asso-
ciation with Brooke and Walter Montgomery. In 1878 he
supported Mary Anderson at the Boston theatre, playing
Master Walter to her Julia. He played with Mrs. Potter
in “ Antony and Cleopatra,” and afterwards visited
Australia as the Earl in “ Little Lord Fauntleroy.” He
was a famous entomologist, for some time edited the
leading entomological journal in the States, and enjoyed
the friendship of Agassiz. He won reputation as an
orator and author, and delivered funeral addresses over
the remains of John McCullough, Mary Fiske and others.
He left no relatives, and no family except his wife. He
was an agnostic, and his body w as cremated, according to
his wish. Joseph Jefferson, Harrison Fiske and George
Parsons Lathrop were among the pall-bearers, and many
distinguished literary people were around the grave. The
funeral oration was delivered by'William Winter.
Dan. Barry has been stirring them up at Toowoomba
with “Arrah-na-Pogue” and “The Parson’s Oath.”
L. J. Lohr has gone to Maoriiand to “ advance ”
Williamson’s Juvenile Opera Co. during a four months’
tour. Tom Pollard will he stage-manager, and the
kiddies will nlav “ Mikado,” “lolanthe,” “ La Mascotte,”
“ Tambour Major,” &o.
Bland Holt has purchased the Australasian rights of
Pettitfsnew drama, “The Sailor’s Knot,” which will first
be produced at Drury Lane on August 3.
Posted on the Sydney City Coroner’s office-door:—“The
City Coroner will be at his residence, ‘ Oakhurst,’ West-
street, St. Leonards, till 6.30 p.m. to-night, but not later.
After that he can be found in the dress-circle of Her
Majesty’s theatre, where he will he sitting on the left-
hand side as you go in the door. If the police bring in
report from Botany re dead infant, they will know where
the Coroner is to be found. He (the coroner) will want to
see the parents, or one of them, also the doctor’s report
about the child.”
Some of the Gaiety one-line-part damsels complain that
Tot tie Blank is too high and mighty altogether since she
iiis' «l id'ii into a diamond brooch. Envy, yerknow—
simply envy.
ny is a chorus nymph ‘never deaf to the voice of love?
Because she lias such a keen sense o’ ear-ring. Quite right,
too, for when love is o'er they part no more with Ear-ring
or the Rhino.
George Ireland will not retire for life on his Melbourne
benefit. The entire receipts at the Opera House only
totted up to £l5O odd, whereas a good Saturday matinde
at the PrinCess’ might have yielded £250 at least.
The new Melbourne Royal management have arranged
to swap shows with George Rignold. Handsome G. will
take his company over to the Royal when “ The Dancing
Girl ” shifts to Her Majesty’s, Sydney.

(Melb.) lately questioned the accuracy of the same para,
graph (No. 1 quo t'd) referring to the decision rf
Bompas, Q.C., at Plymouth in re intimidation. Wait
till the mail comes and you will see we were right...
“J.A.T.” (Junee): We are quite sure that we never
said in The Bulletin that we only favoured Woman
Suffrage because of the access of voting-power to the
National cause. On the contrary, we are and have
been, ever since we could think, keenly alive to the fact
that women’s votes would at first be largely controlled by
priestly and other castes. However, we recognise that
women must ultimately have votes, and the best way to
teach them how to use votes is to give them votes to play
with, just as the old man gives his young son a watch,
and trusts to Providence to keep the mainspring whole.
The world has to take its gruel “M. Dies”: Your
true cotton-wool bourgeois carefully eschews politics,
a.nd all public matters, devotes himself to making money,
lives in his own little Goshen, and gets more happiness out
of the world than anybody, by cunning selfishness..
“J. F.” (Woorndoo): Address Reynolds’ Newspaper,
Strand, London, enclosing Bs. Bd., which covers subscrip-
tion and postage for one year “Inquisitive”; We are
informed by the Sydney representative of the Equitable
Society of the U.S. that —(1) The Equitable is organised

street (Sydney) property has been completed ; (3) They
have not been sued to complete the purchase ; (4) We refer
you to the policy conditions of the various companies for

“ M.M.”: go your “MS, is rather dirty on account of

you call them ? “ Judge a man by the company he
keeps.” “L.” (Upper M‘D.): Well, if you persist in
“ making a door-mat of The Bulletin” you’ll eventually
have more brains in your feet than you appear likely to
ever have in your head “F. H. M‘o." : Send us some-
thing printable, please. . ,“Ch. B.”; Thanks “Price
Waning” thus answers his correspondentsN.”
(Bathurst): Yes; three copies are known by “P.W.” to
exist of the old print of the racehorse Skeleton. One near
Camden, one at Blackheath, and one in the possession of
Mr. G. P). Rowley, the popular secretary of the Rosehill
Racing Club, who, no doubt, would be only too pleased to
show it to you. Other copies, of course, may be in exist-
ence, but still the print is a rare one.H.T.” (In-
verell): “ P.W.” will write you this week “F.H.” (C.):
The authority for the story is mainly a manuscript of the
Rev. Mr. Schofield, which was confirmed and amplified by
convict traditions ... “F. J.”( Mount Zeehan, Tas.): Many
thanks for your enclosure. “P.W.” will write you
direct. The accuracy of his descriptions of Macquarie
Harbour scenery, which you confirm, is due to the simple
fact that he made a special trip to the harbour....
“ C.W.” (B.): A mere slip of the pen, or, perhaps, a typo-
graphical error, which the context explained away
“ M.D.” (Taree): Many thanks for your communication.
“P. W.” will write you direct with the information you
require “R.T.” (Kelso): There is no discrepancy
between the details of coal-mine working in the “ Libera-
tion of the Three,” and in the Convict Narrative now
being published in a Sydney paper. The time of “ The
Liberation of the Three,” P. W.’s story, was laid in the
Commandancy of Dr. “ Rossell ” and the Governorship of
Colonel Arthur. The ex-convict speaks of a period seven
or eight years later, when coa! mines had been systemati-
cally opened out by Captain O’Hara Booth and were being
worked on Cornish lines. Lieutenant-Colonel Logan, of
the 63rd Regiment, ordered the shafts first to be sunk
without due regard to the scientific conditions, and the
methods of working were no more intelligent. The
original gangs of workers were selected according to their
class of crime.
The N.S. W. Inspector-General of Police is

Old Parkes once more (to his St. Leonards’
constituents, in his very best piccolo tones): “ Hi

The Victorian Assembly has dropped the
title “ Commonwealth ” from the Federation Bill
by 46 votes against 22, Graves, M.P., remarking
that “ Commonwealth ” meant Fenianism. It is
explained that in vetoing “ Commonwealth,” the
Assembly was “ only cursing Cromwell.”
John Roberts was on the whole only able
to give them an occasional suggestion of his real
powers during his series of exhibition games at
Melbourne Athenaeum. A long sea-voyage had
put the champion (who is getting very grey) con-
siderably out of form, yet he contrived to do some
beautiful work every now and then, especially
when he had a good house to play to. In this
direction the Hopetouns gave their gracious
assistance. Lady Hopetoun not only came on a
State visit with her liege lord to study nursery
cannons, but Tuesday of this week she was tc
come again on her own account. Roberts has
ever been tire billiard pet of the high and mighty,
for the reason that he conducts himself like a
gentleman and can always play up on special
occasions—the very thing that most of his
rivals cannot do.


""This narrative is mainly founded upon conversations
with a prominent official- he died only the other day—who
was for some years immediately associated with Colone
Arthur. Documentary evidence is, in addition, extant for
nearly every statement made in the course of the Tale,
and the words put into the mouth of the characters are
mere paraphrases of utterances of their originals. The
“police reports” and convict “records” quoted are
authentic in every particular; “ Longden’s ” letter
is that of a veritable convict. In the wording of the
Executioner’s Oath, the author has followed his informant
instead of transcribing another form which he has in his
possession, which, however, does not differ very materially
from the former. “The Sheriff’s bidding,” which con-
cludes the administration of the oath, was uttered, it is
asserted, on as recent an occasion in England as the
appointment of that late honored servant of the State,
Calcraft.

No. XII —A Day with Governor Arthur.*
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Colonel George Arthur is sitting in an
arm-chair in his study. The deep whirr of a
dock (by Dent, London: you can see it, if not
hear it, to-day in a Hobart public office) as it
a trikes the hour of 10 is audible. He is always
punctual is Governor Arthur, Lieutenant-
Governor of Vandemonia always has been
always, will be. There are some men whose past
unerringly foretells their future. Arthur is oim of
these men. When, as representative of British
Majesty, he flogged a woman in his West Indian
principality, he concluded his order for the punish-
ment with the word “punctually.” When he
signs a death-warrant now, he hands it to the
Clerk of Council with the remark: “Let the
warrant be obeyed punctually.” When his
doctor tells him in the course of a few years that
Death will wait upon him after the expiration or
an hour, you may depend upon it, Sir George, as
he will be then, will simply request the medical
man to present his compliments to the gentleman
with the scythe, and desire him to be punctual.
And as he is in precept, so he is in practice.
At the first stroke of ten, then, His Excellency
sits him down, and begins the day’s routine. It is
an “off day,” that is to say, His Excellency d«pes
not this morning propose to do his Executive
Councillors the pleasure of going through the
form of conferring with them upon points as to
which he has already made up his mind. Conse-
quently, there being no Executive Council to.
bother him, he proceeds to act as the Executive. _
We are going to spend the day with him. It is
very rude of us, no doubt, as we have not been
invited. And particularly rude inasmuch as we
know that on the rare occasions that the Governor
departs from his repose of manner it is to consign
all scribblers to the nethermost abode of lost souls.
Frank Goddard, convict, otherwise “Frank tho
Poet,” peopled Hell with penal officials. Governor
Arthur peopled his hell with journalists.
• * *
It is a spare-framed, thin-faced, medium-
sized man who sits in the Governor’s chair ; clean-
shaven, save for a tinge of greyish whisker ; with
steely-grey eyes that look with a critical disbelief
in everything except the System; with a rasp in
the voice. The lines at the corners of the drawn-
down lips spell “Martinet”; the wrinkles of the
brow and the crevices between the eyebrows tell
that he is a precisian. At this present moment
he is supreme over the destinies of 32,000 human
beings, and he looks capable of dealing justly
with 32,000 blocks of pine or gum-wood. That,
possibly, is why he is Lieutenant-Governor of
His Britannic Majesty’s colony and dependency
of Van Dieman’s Land. A man with a heart
would have been out of place in that chair,
* * *
He touches a bell—twice. Mr. J. Fubster,
Comptroller-General of Convicts, enters—bows
deferentially—and is motioned to a chair.
“Good morning, Mr. Comptroller !”
A soft “Good morning, your Excellency, is
breathed by Fubster. He is at liberty to begin
now with business —and to seat himself.
“This day’s business, your Excellency, is appli-
cations for Tickets for November last.”
“Proceed, Mr. Comptroller!”
Standing up and clearing his throat, the Comp-
troller began : u Memorial No. 6GG. Police
Number, 699, James Melrose, per Malabar,
Middlesex Sessions, 30th J une, 182-, life, Hobart
Town, sth August, 182-, 7 years, same date, 7
years ; total term of transportation, life and 14
years. Employed by Mrs. C. Wade, and recom-
mended for ticket by her. Transported for
Burglary. His gaol report: ‘ln Newgate before,
and his hulk report was ‘ orderly.’ He stated this
offence, breaking into a house. Colonial con-
victipns are as follows; —August 5, 182-, by
Supreme Court, stealing a pair of boots; plea,
guilty; sentence, seven years’ transportation to
Macquarie Harbour. Same date and court, steal-
ing soap; plea, guilty; sentence, seven years’
transportation to Macquarie Harbour. March 27,
1827, exchanging his hat with prisoner who was
about to abscond, 50 lashes. June 27, 182-,
destroying his shirt, 25 lashes. October, 28, 182--,
not accomplishing his weekly task of work, 18
lashes. February 14, 1832, ordered 50 lashes by
employer for disrespectful conduct and in-
solence to Miss Ann Wade, 50 lashes, and returned
to service. November 20, 1832, drunk ad-
monished.”
“Who signs?”
“Mr. Muster-Master Mason, your Excellency.
“ What do you recommend ? ”
“I cannot recommend, sir.”
“Quite right, Mr. Comptroller. There seems
a hiatus in his record between 182- and 1832.
There must be some mistake there. It is impos-
sible that a man of this desperate character should
have committed no offences for several years !”
“ That’s what I think, your Excellency.”
“Reprimand the record clerk ——”
“ The record clerk is a transport, sir.”
“ A transport}! And to make such a serious
•omission ! It must be intentional, Mr. Comp-
troller. Have him punished, sir—send him to the
chain-gang.”
“ May I suggest, sir, that I should merely dock
his allowances and severely caution him? He’s a
very useful writer, sir, on the whole.”
“Oh, in that case, Mr. Comptroller, punish him
as you suggest. And note, please, that this
ticket is refused.”
And so was Mr. James Melrose’s chance of ob-
taining temporary freedom put back for at least
six, and probably twelve months. On the hypo-
thesis, as likely as not entirely erroneous, that the
record clerk had made a serious mistake in trans-
scribing, from the registers, on No. 699’s report
parchment the debits against his name, that per-
verse son of the System was doomed to a continued
period of slavery. What to precisian Colonel
Arthur, and what to disciplinarian Fubster,
was it, that the transport might be rendered
•desperate by the non-success of his mighty effort
to win a “ ticket ” by good conduct ? To the Men
of the Regime it should have been easy enough to
have read between the lines of the record. A
man naturally of weak disposition, made worse
by unspeakable surroundings and petty tyrannies
—with impulses towards good even at Macquarie
Harbour (witness that exchange of hats)—then
coming under a master or mistress of rnore_ than
average kindness of heart whom he would, in the
intervals of good conduct, brave by an occasional
act of insolence or insubordination —that was this
character obviously to men who understood the
System.
Now, Colonel Arthur and Factotum Fubster
BREAKING THE RECORD.

MRS. MURPHY (with pride): “Sivin polacemin, Mrs. McCanty.”
professed to know the System. They knew, How-
ever, but the one side of it. The gap in No.
699’s record was to them nothing but a convict-
writer’s error. That it could be accounted foi
bv Melrose’s abstinence from ill-doing—pooh,
impossible ! And so No. 699 was “ put back.”
* * *
“Next!”
“Memorial No. 667. Cole Richard, Lancaster
Assizes, 22 April, 182-, life. Application recom-
mended bv Mr. J. England, J. A. Jackson, Esq.,
J. Simpson, Esq., and Mr. R. Court. Now
employed in Freed Police, Campbell Town. Tran-
sported for stealing from the person ; gaol-report,
‘twice convicted before’-hulk-report, ‘good.’
Stated this offence, pocket-picking; denies having
been convicted before. Colonial Convictions :
November 2, 182-, Supreme Court, aiding and
abetting in assault on a woman, not guilty.
January 11, 182-, Magistrate Fisher, neglect of
duty for the last 3 days, 50 lashes and 3rd class.
Feb 8, 182-, absent from his gang, between 10 and
11 o’clock this day, 25 lashes ; April 23, 182-,

duct, 25 lashes. Feb. 3, 182 -, W. Abel, magis-
trate, assault, 25 lashes. March 10, 182-, same
magistrate, threatening and abuse, 6 months

sported to penal settlement for two years. June 16,
182-, by penitentiary superintendent for reporting
himself as sick, and not having anything the
matter with him; reprimanded. December 26,
183 , by superior officer of Eield Police, neglect of
duty ; fined 10s.”
“ Who signs? ”
“ Muster-Master Mason. ” )(
“ And your recommendation is ? ”
“ I regret, your Excellency, that this man has
been allowi dto join the police. The circum-
stances attending the assault on the woman for
which he was tried are still strong in my recollec-
tion, as it occurred in my own neighbourhood.”
“But he was found not guilty, did you not
say ? ”
“ Yes, sir, but ” ,
“Then, why say anything about the offence .
demanded the just Governor. He was always
just was Arthur ! A desire to be just was his
strong point, he used to say.
“ Apart from that altogether though, Mr.
Comptroller,” the Governor went on, as Fubster
remained silent, “ the applicant must be refused.
The man seems a most improper subject for the
police; but, being in it, the opportunity may be
afforded him to prove that he is a reformed
character.”
“Yes, your Excellency. Shall I minute that
observation ?”
“Certainly. Now the next.”
And, delaying just a minute to record the fact
that Richard Cole, No. 473, per Elphinstone,
would be allowed to derive further advantage
from the moral associations of the Freed Police,
the Comptroller-General passed to another of the
current applications for tickets.
“ Memorial No. 668, Police No. 1701, Henfrey
Simon, .tried at Nottingham, March, 182 , life.
Recommended by Messrs. Hill, Gunning, and
Butcher. Employed by Messrs. Signed and Hill.
Transported for sheep-stealing. Gaol report,
‘ not known before ; good in gaol. * Hulks report,
‘orderly.’ Stated his offence sheep-stealing.
Hath no colonial offence recorded. Mason signs.”
“No offence?” queried His Excellency. “ Shall
we give him a ticket?”
“ Well, sir, I think not. He has not served the
regulated period,” rejoined the Comptroller-
General.
“ Refused, then !” said the Governor. And No.
1761 was “ put back ” also.
“ Memorial No. 669. Police No., 2693.
Porter John. Tried at Stafford, 17 Oct., 182—.
Seven years. Recommended by J. T. Gelhbrand,
Esq., who employs him. Transported for stealing
from the person. Gaol Report: ‘An incorrigible
youth ; has been many times in prison, and con-
nected with Wolverhampton thieves. Orderly in
gaol.’ Stated his offence, ‘ Stealing five shillings
from a young woman; twice for leaving my
master.’ Hath no colonial offences on record.
The Muster-Master signs.”
“ What do you say, Mr. Comptroller ?”
“This, your Excellency, is another case, where
applicant has not served the regulated period.”
“The transport is incorrigible, eh? Still, we
must encourage him to hope, conditional on im-
provement. Refused at present, but as he brought
so bad a character, it is gratifying to perceive that
his conduct has been uniformly correct. Grant
him a ticket on the King’s birthday. Wo must
never shut out hope altogether from the convicts,
Mr. Comptroller. That has always been my
policy, as you know. And I am stating it at
great length to Lord Goderich by the outgoing
mail. Are there many more applications’”
“Some fifty, your Excellency. The next has
some peculiar circumstances connected with it,
sir. The applicant, of fair conduct enough,
obtained his master’s frank to the cover of the
application, which was directed, of course, to
the Muster-Master, and then pasted a slip
over the address. Upon the slip there was a
British address, and inside the form he enclosed
a letter for an English friend ! ”
“ The rascal! ” exclaimed his Excellency. “ And
how was the fraud detected ? ”
“Well, sir, the ignorant fellow thought his
master’s signature would frank the letter out of
the colony as well as within it! That not being
the case, the Post-office stopped the letter, sent it
back to Captain Hepburn, the transport’s master,
and, of course, the thing was discovered.”
“Then, how does the application come before
me? An application from such a man—why,’tis
scandalous ! ”
“ So I remarked, your Excellency, but Captain
Hepburn said he was prepared to overlook the
wrong because of the man’s ingenuity and the good
tone of his letter. I have the letter here. Shall
I read it, sir?”
His Excellency assented, and Mr, Eubster read
this ;—

N. B. The master I am With is Capt. Hepburn, Esq. J.P.
Brother-in-Law to Thos. Hosie Esq. Manager at Millers
Wharf. London.
“Well!” exclaimed Arthur as Eubster con-
cluded the reading. “ And in face of that letter,
the man’s ma ter recommends him for a ticket!
Remove the employer from the list of eligibles,
and send the man to the chain-gang.”
“ Yes, your Excellency, but—ah, may I suggest,
sir, that the Captain has great—er —home in-
fluence ? ”
“H’m, ah ! Perhaps the case, then, as regards the
master will be met by a respectful letter pointing
out that discipline will be subverted if he displays
the like tolerance in the future. Why, he actually
compounds a felony—obtaining a postal frank by
false pretences is a felony, is it not ? ”
The Comptroller hesitates in his reply, and then
begs to suggest that as the law is not quite explicit
on the point, the question should be referred to
the Crown-Solicitor. “’Tis an unusual offence,
your Excellency—can scarcely have been antici-
pated by the Honorable the Council.”
“Nevertheless, Mr. Comptroller, once done the
deed will be repealed. Mr. Solicitor shall prepare
a draft-clause making the offence felony.”
“ And the man, sir—the transport Longden.”
“ I leave him to your jurisdiction, Comptroller.
But, of course, ticket refused, and, I should think,
the chain-gang.”
And at a later period of the day Transport
Longden is awarded, in his absence, twelve
months’ gang “for abusing his master’s con-
fidence.”
# * #
The ingenious Longden having been thus
helped forward to the next stage to perdition,
Comptroller-General Eubster passed to other
applications.
“A woman, your Excellency. Memorial No.
(590. Ship No. 108 per Fairlie, Louisa Newnes ;
place of trial not known and transport refuses to
states, but sentence, she says, 14 years- .”
“ Make a note, Mr. Comptroller, to ascertain
how it is that the ship’s indent was so imperfect.
I must draw the Colonial Secretary’s attention to
the circumstance and cause the Indent-clerk to be
punished. What was the ship’s captain about to
start with imperfect papers ?”
“ The ship started with papers complete, sir,
but a male transport —the Eairlie was a double-
classer, t sir—acting as surgeon’s-clerk, dropped
all the papers overboard, with a 161b.-shot
attached.”
“Mr. Comptroller ! how is it I never heard of
this before?” In his wrath, the Governor rose
from his chair. “ And why was not the Surgeon-
Superintendent punished for employing a convict-
writer contrary to Regulation in that casemade
and provided ?”
“ ’Twas in Governor Sorell’s time, sir! And
he thought the least said soonest mended, parti.

cularly as the writer was, sir—dead, sir, when the
ship arrived !”
“ Dead ? Oh, was that the yard-arm case .'
“Yes, your Excellency !”
“ Ah, I recollect now. And was nothing done
to the Surgeon?”
“Oh yes, sir. We were short of doctors at the
time, and so he was put on the permanent staff.
It was Dr. Burleigh, sir !”
“ Burleigh, was it? A good officer and a care-
ful one now, whatever he may have been in the
past. But proceed, Mr. Comptroller.”
“She is recommended by Mr. J. Hutchinson
and A. Turnbull, Esquire. She says her gaol
report was bad, and that she was capitally con-
victed at Newgate, receiving sentence of death,
but commuted to two years in the penitentiary
and fourteen beyond seas. States offence as steal-
ing silver teapot. Colonial report: Theft, com-
mitted for trial.”
“You recommend?”
“Yes, your Excellency. The female is at pre-
sent in the House of Correction under sentence.
But the Surgeon wishes her to take the situation
of nurse at the hospital, as she is skilful and kind-
hearted.”
“Under what sentence, did you say?”
The Comptroller re-scans the parchment and
the application-form, but the information is not
given in either document.
“Unstated, sir, I’m sorry to say !”
“Unstated, Mr. Comptroller! Is this a way
to prepare a report for me ? Her record says
‘committed for trial.’ How was she then dis-
posed of ?” , . „
“She must have oeen sentenced, sir! ihe
Comptroller sees he is “in for it,” and not en-
joying the Colonel in one of his black moods,
mentally resolves to make somebody suffer. “And
the convict-writer must have omitted, to enter the
conviction,”
“See that he’s punished, Mr. Comptroller,
And reprimand the free clerk in charge of the
office !”
“Yes, your Excellency. We must make an
example ! So much depends on the records being
accurately kept. What are your orders as to this
woman, sir? The doctor wishes her services
particularly.”
“ No, in this case I must refuse ! Appointment
to a nursing post would be an indulgence the
woman does not merit. She herself says her
home record was bad, and most likely her trans-
portation-sentence was life, and that she is lying
when she says it was for fourteen years only. No
indulgence !”
Thus it was nearly always. A transport’s state-
ment against himself or herself was almost in-
variably accepted by the Authorities, but he or
she was never believed when there was a possi-
bility of the statement being in the transport’s
own favour.
Thus, too, was it generally in the matter of
negligently-written-up records. It was a convict-
writer who was punished ; it was the Free Clerk,
or the other official, who was really the offending
person, who got off scot free. Which was just;
for a convict-writer was by virtue of the fact
liable to punishment. The Regime did not
recognise convict-writers, and, indeed, distinctly
prohibited their employment; and, therefore, if
they consented to be employed they disobeyed
“ the Regulation in that case made and provided.”
The circumstance that they dare not refuse to be
employed when so directed by an authority—say.
the Governor or the Comptroller-General—went,
of course, for nothing. If there was one .thing
more than another the System was partial to, it
was the construction of dilemmas; and though
the transport might object to being impaled on
one horn, there was always the other at his con-
venience.
* * *
While we have been making this digression,
Colonel Arthur has been refusing more and more
applications, occasionally, it must be said, varying
the process by an'approval. One “ Approved ”to
10 “ Refused,” that was about the average.
The list ended, the Governor condescended to
consult the inferior (though still potent) official,
as to the terms of a despatch he was drafting to
Viscount Goderich, Secretary of State for the
Colonies.
“ I chiefly desire, Mr. Comptroller, your
opinion on this portion. It is with reference to
the special and educated convicts, and their pro-
posed treatment at Port Arthur. I am loth to
abandon Macquarie Harbour as a Penal Settle-
ment—we have derived great advantage from it,
but the filling up of the bar is rendering naviga-
tion dangerous. So I have made up my mind to
direct the abandonment of the Harbour and to
devote my attention to all the measures best
calculated to render Tasman’s Peninsula, which
really seems to have been designed by Providence
for a penitentiary, a perfect institution. Do you
follow me, Mr. Comptroller ?”
“ Oh, most readily, sir. And if I may be per-
mitted to say so, if anyone can devise a perfect
penal establishment I am sure 'tis your Ex-
cellency !”
“Yes, Mr. Comptroller, I do not doubt my
success, if I can depend upon the willing co-
operation of able and experienced officers like
myself!”
“ That, your Excellency, I need scarcely
trouble to assure you of. The Staff are only too
proud to have the opportunity of working under
so brilliant and—er—h’m—philanthropic an ad-
ministrator ! You were saying about the specials,
sir?”
“ Oh, yes,” and the pleased Governor, who, with
all his strength of character, was never to be
offended by the most fulsome ot compliments,
especially when they alluded to his philanthropy,
went on to read what he had written.
44 This is what I say to his Lordship in recom-
mending the despatch to Port Arthur of this
special class. 4 The educated class are at present
the link by which the free and the bond are so
amalgamated as to make the distinction betwixt
slavery and freedom less marked than it ought to
be. It is desirable there should be no such
mingling : a man should be either free or bond,
and be treated as such.’ ”
44 Very good, if I may say so, your Excellency.
Most admirably put.”
The Governor continued : 44 4 1 have long disap-
proved of the employment of convict clerks under
any circumstances, and have taken every prudent
means of limiting their numbers, for I am con-
vinced that convict discipline cannot be con-
sidered perfect until every special is treated as an
ordinary convict.’ ”
44 That’s true, your Excellency.”
4 4 4 For if one receive indulgence irregularly, or
be placed in any easy situation, enabling him to
assume a respectable appearance, the System is
broken in upon, and a single representation to his
friends in England will be sufficient to deprive
transportation of much of its terrors. Criminals
do not, when writing to their friends, dwell upon
the hardships they suffer, but rather delight in
holding up the bright side of the picture.’ ”
44 Quite accurate, your Excellency, quite !” Yet
Longden’s letter was before them !
4 4 4 As it appears specials dread transportation
less than any other class, I have made arrange-
ments for their deportation upon arrival hereto
Tasman’s Peninsula, should such be the pleasure
of his Majesty’s Government, where they will be
deprived even of the hope of eluding, by artifice,
the miseries they have drawn upon themselves.’
There, how will that do, Mr. Comptroller ? ”
44 It must carry conviction to the Imperial
Government, your Excellency, of the wisdom of
your proposed sten.”
44 Yes, I think it will. And the Right Honor-
able the Secretary of State will not fail to appre-
ciate an argument I propose to communicate
unofficially, that the presence in the streets of
this city of special convicts, who, tor
the most part, come from the upper
order of society, is a direct inducement
to the circulation of those revolu-
tionary ideas which are so subversive
of Law, Order and Society. How
can the lower classes retain respect
for the upper orders, if members of
the latter are seen walking public
streets under the convict ban ? ”
“Very true, your Excellency, very
true!”
“Then you agree, Mr. Comptroller,
generally with my views.”
“Oh, yes! your Excellency, I can
suggest no improvement.”
“Then send the clerk who is your
best penman to me in the morning. I t
is a most important despatch as it
quite alters our System, and I must
have a clear copy for Downing-street
made with the utmost care.”
“ Shall the Clerk be ‘ free ’ or 4 bond,’
sir ? ”
44 Oh, your best.”
“Then, the ablest man I have, your
Excellency, is Convict-writer Dallas."’
44 Well, let him be here at ten punc-
tually to-morrow. And now,” rising
as he spoke, 41 this completes your
business with me for the day ? ”
44 Yes, sir, with the exception of
one little matter the executioner’s
oath.”
44 Ah ! I was forgetting ! Is the man
in attendance? If so, produce him.”

Convict Richard Johnson, suc-
cessor to Dougherty in the onerous
and well-paid post of hangman to His
Majesty’s Government in Vande-
monia, had shown a tendency of late
to partiality in the performance in his
duties. After the last but two 44 drop-
ping off,” it was rumoured that one of
the criminals who had, it was sup-
posed, been hurried into the next
world, had been resuscitated within
the time prescribed for the suspen-
sion of the body. The rumour as
to this occurrence had not reached
the ears of the Authorities for three
or four weeks after the ceremony, and
owing to the lapse of that time and to
the admixture of quicklime with the
bodies which participated in the rites,
it had been deemed inexpedient to
attempt exhumation. The Authorities,
though content to let the matter—and
the bodies—rest, thought it, however,
advisable to prevent a further instance of the like
partiality, and concluded that there was no better
way of securing their end than by imposing what
had for some years dropped into disuse—the
executioner’s oath.
Mr. Johnson, being so important a functionary
and the occasion being so novel, it was thought well
to impress him by administering the oath in the
overawing presence of the Governor himself. Ihe
formula was to be the ancient English one, and
the incidents of the scene were framed after the
same pattern. Only, instead of the Testament
being tendered to the Executioner by the Sheriff,
as was the old English practice, the Comptroller-
General, being the convict’s nominal master and
the man to whom Johnson was in the last resort
responsible, was to administer the oath.
Johnson was ushered in. He brought with him,
pursuant to instructions, a bag.
He saluted, and in obedience to a motion of
Mr. Fubster’s hand, arranged the contents
of the bag on a table. Two pairs of hand-
cuffs, a set of double leg-irons with bazils and
centre-link complete, and a new fifteen-foot rope,
gathered in a coil. A white cap, and a black cap
completed the number of the dread insignia.
“ You arc Richard Johnson, per ship Mangles?
demanded the Comptroller.
The executioner pulled his forelock.
“You are the public Executioner of His
Majesty’s Colony and Dependency of Van
Dieman’s Land?”
Johnson scraped his right foot, and bent his
head.
“ Hitherto you have been unsworn, but it has
been thought'necessary by his Excellency the
Governor that you should take an oath for the
faithful, exact, true, and impartial performance of
your duties. Are you willing to take that obliga-
tion ?”
“Yes, y’r Honor !”
The Comptroller-General lifted a Testament—
there were always copies available in every public
office ; oaths were taken at every hour of the day-
and, opening the Book at one of the Gospels, bade
Johnson place his left hand on the rope, and take
the Book in his right.
“ Now, Johnson, follow me !” As the Comp-
troller read these words from a slip of blue paper,
Johnson recited them after him.
44 1, Ri hard Johnson, Transport, acting under
a ticket - of-leave as present Executioner, do
willingly undertake to well, faithfully, exactly
and truly perform the duties appertaining to the
office of the Common Executioner of His Majesty s
Colony of Van Dieman’s Land, and do now vow
and make oath that I will carry out and fulfil such
duties as the Law may direct upon the bodies and
persons of every felon committed to my charge
without fear or favour, though the body and
person be that of friend or kin, my father or my
mother, my sister or my brother, my wife or my
child, or other bone of my bone, or of other flesh
of my flesh, So help me God.”
Then he kissed the Book.
The Comptroller turned to His Excellency.
44 Must the—ah—old command be given, your
Excellency ? ” . , „ ,
The Governor motioning assent, the Comptroller,
raising his right-hand, and speaking with as much
harshness as he could throw into his voice, cried :
44 Get Thee Hence, Wketch!”

THE FIRST REAL VICTORIAN MAJOR.
It was Catherine de Medici who first
insisted upon smooth stockings. Up to her time
they were worn as are gloves to-day, very much
wrinkled. Evidently the new fashion was liked,
for to have a wrinkled stocking has been a disgrace
to womankind ever since.
In the autobiography of that philanthropic
old physician, Dr. Singleton (Melb.), it is related
how the wife of the executed convict Melnotte,
a Frenchwoman, named Alphonsine, got the body
and put it in her Little Bourke-street window
decorated with flowers, all day, and at night sur-
rounded it with tapers. A grand wake was held ;
after this episode no more bodies of the executed
were handed over to relatives.
The South Australian papers report the
painful case of a gentleman who got lost in the
bush near Silverton. It was pitch-dark, so he lie
a fire and camped for the night—only unfort
tunately he took an epileptic fit and fell into th-
blaze, and lay there combusting. When he woke
up his right hand was nearly burnt off, and the
arm shrivelled up. Then, being completely
bushed, he had to sit by the fire and shriek in a
mournful key for the rest of the night, and the
emu heard him howling, and the wild dog yelled
in reply, and the lonesome wilds were tilled with
notes of woe. Next morning he rode about
twenty-five miles to get the stump amptuated,
and after that he laid up in an hospital. The
hanging-reporters of the evening papers are
invited to consider this incident, and fill in details
about the strange shadows and dreary echoes of
that midnight encampment, and the gruesome
dreams of the frizzled traveller as he sat in his
horrid solitude, and the odour of burning flesh,
and the hollow, far-off sighing of the breeze upon
the mountains’ and the murmurs of the stream,
and all the rest of the properties.

The “Cup’’Blend a marvellous tea in the cup,
The late Peter Carmichael, of Victoria,
was once inspecting a ragged infant-class. A
little beggar, who was being put through the
alphabet, stuck fast at the letter Q. “Come,
come,” said Carmichael, helpingly, “ You know
that feller right enough; just think a while;
don’t hurry.” “Know him? Course I does. X
know the (maggory daggery) thing right enough,
but I can’t remember his (waggery snaggery
baggery) monniker!”
This yarn is being told of the late Thos.
Cox Bray, father of Chief Secretary Bray, of
S.A, At a meeting of the Burra Mine direc-
torate, years ago, Chairman Solomon savagely
blurted out: “ Look here, Bray, for £5 I’d knock
that blessed head of your’s straight.” “ Done! ’’
cried Bray, as he put down a fiver, and insisted
on the mill, which did not, however, cure him of a
ridiculous habit for which he was noted of carry-
ing his head very much on one side like a grinning
fox-terrier.
Suppose yourself the happy possessor of
two millions of money. What would you do
with it ? Would you follow Mr. Paling’s noble
deed and build a sanatorium for the sick ? or
would you follow the lead of “ Jubilee ” Benson
and play it up, and finish in a continental
gaol ? Fancy what you could do with two
millions. You could visit and view the sights of
the old and new worlds, you could keep a
splendid establishment, have scores of servants
at your beck and call, you could keep your
horses and your hounds, your guns, your yachts,
your town and country houses, you could hunt,
fish and travel and live a life of continual
pleasure if—Oh ! that “if” it always creeps in
—if you had good health ! If you had bad
health and could not enjoy your great posses-
sions, what good would all the money and
riches in the terrestrial world be worth to you ?
good health is the great desideratum— preserve
it while you have it, for it may be lost for ever
if you neglect it. While on this subject we
want a few serious words with you. Every
man and woman is the centre of the world to
himself, therefore look after yourself and those
belonging to you, preserve your strength and
take note of the small particulars of daily life.
We want to impress this particularly upon you
—you, reader—we are addressing you personally
—take care of the small signs of constitutional
disturbance, don’t neglect a simple headache
because it is so general, such pains cannot be in
a healthy organism, physical disturbance can-
not be where all organs are performing their
functions with clock-work exactitude. Like a
small spark spreading into a great conflagration,
disease begins in a little way, so little that its
first onslaught is frequently unnoticed, but it
generally extends, until too lath. Take good
advice, attack the first signs by a vigorous
treatment with Clements Tonic, which so
renovates and fertilises the blood, that it will
quickly restore the impaired power of any
organ or tissue. Clements Tonic is a scientific
combination. Its therapeutic effects are proved.
That it will allay and prevent disease is beyond
all doubt, the praise bestowed on it over the
signatures of the highest and most influential
people in the land, will convince the most
sceptical. Mr. F. Bagnell, Ravenhurst, Mar-
rickville, N.S.W., write us: “Dear Sir, —
Allow me to add my testimony to the many
endorsements you have already received, proving
the excellence of Clements Tonic. My wife
has been suffering for the past two years from
weakness and debility, and has tried many
treatments without result, she, as a last resort
commenced the use of Clements Tonic, and I
am thankful to say the effect has been most
gratifying, and I am firmly persuaded that it is
a complete restoration of perfect health.” A.
G. Taylor, Esq., M.L.A., writes; —“Parlia-
ment House, Sydney, Nov. 13th, ’90.—1 have
much pleasure in testifying to the benefits I
have derived from the use of Clements Tonic,
during a severe attack of dyspepsia and in-
digestion. It is a pleasant, palatable and
effective remedy and should be used by every
family. I shall always keep it by me in
future.—A. G. Taylor.” Another well-known
man writes :—“I have great pleasure in testify l
ing to the merits and efficacy of Clements Tonic.
Having been afflicted with extreme nervous
debility and languor during the last two years,
with weary and languid feelings in a morning,
so much so that whilst dressing I should have
to drop into a chair ; eventually I commenced
the use of Clements Tonic and am now restored
to perfect health and vigor and would recom-
mend it to all so afflicted.—James Leonard,
Renwick-street, Birkenhead, N.S. W.” Send

town, N.S.W.

As The Bulletin enthusiastically pre-
dicted would be the case, the Privy Council upset
(on the contention raised by this paper, and not
on the legal objection raised at the hearing of the
appeal at Sydney) the decision of the N.o.
Fall Court in the case of Dr. M‘Leod, found
guilty of having committed bigamy in America—
thus upholding the opinion of Judge Windeyer
against that of Chief Justice Darley and Judge
limes. The case was, from the very first, as clear
as daylight to every lawyer and level-headed lay-
man. That a man should have been imprisoned
for 14 months, pending the decision of such a
transparent matter, is an indelible disgrace to the
N.S.W. Bench. The dunder-headedness shown
in the M‘Leod case by the majority of the Court
would have discredited the weakest-headed mem-
ber of the Articled Clerics’ Association.
* * «
M‘Leod has now been released. The
Privy Council decision says he is to get costs.
From whom, is a mystery.

Died of a rush of his own high collar to
the head! At a Southern coffee palace last
week a man was found in bed in a strangled
condition, He had on all his clothes, including a
portentous collar that went up about his ears, and
the conclusion arrived at was that he had rashly
lain down and gone to sleep in full costume, and
the collar had asphyxiated him. The deceased was
aged only 35 years, and was thus cut off in the
flower and blossom of his existence, treacherously
slain by his own linen in the dark. His togs came
silently upon him in that hour when night is
calmest, and laid him low. There was nothing
odorious about his end ; if he had died on a battle-
field, or had stood on the deck of a sinking ship,
or perished amid the ruins of a falling kingdom
with burning palaces collapsing on his head, he
might have made a passing sensation, and would
probably have left some footprints on the sands of
Time, but he -was only shot by his shirt in an
attic, and dropped into an obscure grave. His
fate is a warning to the rising generation to
beware of the tall collar that walketh in darkness
and the immense starched bosom that lays for its
victim in shadowy places.

If Bellew has really married Mrs. Brown-
Potter, the deed was doubtless done in order that
the lady might not want for a name to travel
upon. James Brown-P. objected, we imagine, to
being advertised all around the globe by a fair
divorcee, more especially as he may have a mind
to start another real Mrs. Potter of his own at an
early date. Wherefore Curly, for chivalrous
and professional reasons, also because he couldn’t
help it, followed his leading lady into a registrar's
office and made her Mrs. B’lew.
Sydney society will be shocked before long
by a tale of perfidy with the inevitable woman in
it. Strangely enough the usual man isn’t in it at
all on this occasion.

A lively scene took place the other day in
a Sydney grill-room. A Mr. Blank was seated at
a table diligently shovelling down his capacious
maw a shilling’s-worth of “chops and taters,”
oblivious of the exits and entrances of the motley
crowd that elbowed its way in and out, Entered
a Mr. Billabong (who knew Blank casually), just
well enough “corned ”to be nasty. Now, one of
Blank’s peculiarities-is to use his knife when,
according to the “strict rules,” he should em-
ploy his fork. Billabong, observing this, gently
pointed it out to him ; Blank heeded not, but
muttered something about people minding their
own business, and, regardless of the feelings of
. . , ./ s
Billabong, continued to shovel away with hi
blade. This was too much for the latter (who
used to be a great “ entertainer ”in the good old
days). “For God’s sake, Blank, stop it; you’ll
cut your blanky head off!” he ejaculated. No
response from old Blank, who still “ kept at it.”
Words proving useless, Billabong seized a loaf of
bread from the table, and, taking aim, made a
cannon off Blank’s bald pate on to a big glass
window. Then Billabong and Blank “went for ”
each other, and the game didn’t finish till the
police were called in. Blank does not stoke him-
self there now.

Whafc a dread rich Australians have of the
British income-tax commissioners! This accounts,
no doubt, for the fact that so many gilded
“colonists” prefer to “pig it” in hotels rather
than take comfortable private houses (as they did
in the country where they made their cash) and
risk a visit from the tax-collector. For instance,
J F ——, an Australian millionaire, lives at
one of Bailey’s hotels in London, and does not
even indulge in the luxury of taking his meals in
comfort in a private sitting-room. He is one of
the most solidly wealthy of the absentee brigade,
and yet is ever haunted by a morbid fear that he
will die a beggar.

It will interest his friends to learn that a
certain rich Australian brewer who is starring it
in England, now eats “pays” with his fork.
Those new-fangled “ sparrowgrass ” tongs are,
however, he says, “ the very divil.”

SHE : “ Indeed it does’nt; why ? ”
HE: “Because rain is good for ducks.”
A Melbourne firm of “ universal pro-
viders ” were wickedly hoaxed, the other day,
bv a bogus letter from one of Hopetoun’s aides
requesting two tons of meat, more or less, to be
carted up to Govingment ’Ouse as soon as possible.
The entire butchery staff of the establishment was
ordered to set about trussing the requisite number
of fatted calves and things, and when the new
extra special waggon had been carefully loaded up
with carcases, and the horses ornamented with
choice rosettes, the boss partner called for his
patent-leather boots, and proceeded to tool the
caravan along himself. On arriving at Hopetoun’s
fortress, however, the jubilant dealer in animal
food was received in a cold, haughty manner by
the commander-in-chief of the cooks, who stated
that the garrison was already full victualled and
wanted no more meat. Also the noble young aide
staggered forth, with the firm's letter of thanks in
his hand, and suggested that there must be some
confounded mistake somewhere, haw ! Where-
upon the deluded non-purveyor of flesh to his
Excellency drove home again, accompanied by his
body-guard of butchers, and the two tons of meat
were cast loose upon the world at an alarming
sacrifice whilst the rosettes were recklessly given
away with pounds of butter.
Tho N.S.W. Registrar-General, finding
such a state of things inconsistent with the
dignity of a Government establishment, has
ukased that in future none of his myrmidons shall
work in their shirt-sleeves.

A titled female some time ago went into a
Brisbane store run on democratic principles, and
started the old game of having half the stun
hauled over the counter for her inspection. Ihe
shopman stood it for a time, but at last he said,
“Come, hurry up, ma’am, please. I cant stop
with you all day.” She replied, 44 You evidently
don’t know me. I’m Lady ——I don t care
who you are. We can’t waste time on people who
don’t seem to know what they want,” rejoined
the unassuming purveyor of soft-goods. She left
with an aching void in her pure merino chest.

The collection at St. Jude’s, South Ken-
sington, London, on Hospital-Sunday, was the
largest on record. No doubt this is owing to the
number of Australians who attend that church.
Saul Samuel carried one of the collection-bags.
But how does he get into that gallery ?
* * *
A man was “ lumbered ” the other day, in
northern N.S.W. for stealing a feather mattrass.
Collecting mattrasses seemed to be a mania with
him, for some twenty or thirty were found in his
hut. He intimated that he was in search of a
wife. Two months. Probably mad as a hatter.

A few years ago an Adelaide parson and
temperance-lecturer made a fortune by invest-
ments in mining stock. Not satisfied with his

large sum in a brewery, throwing up his church.

At latest dates there were rowdy crowds
ever ready to receive Tummy outside London
railway-stations, feeding halls, picture galleries,
or other public places where his royal nibs was
expected. The first, glimpse of his large fleshy
countenance would be hailed with shouts of
“’Ave yer brought the counters with yer?” or
“’Ow did yer git on at baccyrar last night?”
Even more trying for the Coming K. was the
inevitable wag who would address loud remarks
to an imaginary friend, such as “ Bill, the counters
is inside ’is bell-topper,” or “Do yer twig em
bulging out his coat-pocket, Charley ?’ ihe lory
dread of the Tranby Croft scandal coming into
Court, and so being brought right under the notice
of the “people” was evidently well-founded.
While the vague story of Tummy’s little
weakness was confined to sassiety papers, which
circulate only amongst the uppah and loyal
bourgeois classes, it didn’t matter much. But,
when full and particular details of the big
case came to be hawked around the kingdom for
a penny, or the still humbler “brown, the tat
fell into the fire of democracy, causing derisive
tongues of flame to dart forth in all directions.
German William’s recent visit must have been a
godsend for his bald-headed uncle. It enabled
the latter to show in public, under cover of that
“splendid reception ” which the British shop-
keepers always administer to any foreign
potentate whose presence is, according to fusty
fiction, a “ good thing for trade.”

When the baccarat case was being tried in
London, “ Wales ” (who admitted having acted as
“ banker ”) occupied a seat on the bench beside
the Lord Chief Justice; yet, when the fan-tan
cases were being heard in Sydney, the other day,
the Chinese “ banker ” occupied a place behind
ihe dock-spikes. Which goes to prove a lot ot

London tradesmen, especially jewellers,
are losing faith in reputed Australian nabob 3,
some of whom come back to their flocks and herds
without taking the trouble to settle up the little
accounts they leave behind them. Which reminds
us that our professional visitors are subject to a
similar complaint. Many of these shining lights
are being earnestly requested to return home
to their bereaved tailors —or send the money.
The secretary of the Marlborough Club
has sent a communique to the English press deny-
ing the report that Mr. Arthur Wilson, son of
the innocent old gentleman of Tranby Croft (who
was always sent to bed wlien the boys and the
women to play baccarat under the roof
where he had forbidden it to please the I unce of
Wales) had been elected a member of the most
exclusive club in London at the request of the
Prince aforesaid. The young gentleman, it is
said, was nominated two years ago, before the
Prince had ever met him. This may be true, but,
as The Bulletin pointed out when the cablegram
on the subject came to hand, theie is a distinct
and transparent suppressio veri all the same. The
secretary ought to have said that young
Mrs. P. and Kyrle Bellew,
Is this pretty story true?
Have you joined hearts and hands
Far away in furrin lands?
Are you, tel! us, madam, pray,
Sworn to honour and obey
Kyrley of the grizzled locks.
Gushing voice, and silken socks ?
Tell us truly, Mister K.,
Have you pitched yourself away—
Have you gone and said “ I will ” ?
Better to be single still.
Marriage is a step insane
When there’s nothing left to gain ;
Why, then, make, when once you’ve got her,
Mrs. B’lew of Mrs. Potter?
Fellows say there’s fun in life
Hugging someone else’s wife ;
But they say the pleasure's flown
If you have to hug your own.
Cupid lingers, artful thing!
Near you till you buy the ring;
Ere that ring begins to wear
Cupid’s gone—he isn’t there.
THE GREAT INEVITABLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Young Kitty was a dashing maid,
So witty, bright, and “snappy,”
Enough of ankle she displayed
To make the strollers happy.
I used to like to take her out,
We sometimes had a carriage ;
But, though she tried to hook her trout,
I wasn’t “ on ” for marriage.
I often dined with her mama
(A pleasant home the gal had),
Then Kit would bring a good cigar,
And sing a touching ballad.
One couldn’t help but like her way,
For chaps are only human ;
Till ten, or twelve, I’d often stay
And ogle that young woman.
She’d pinch my cheek and call me Kirl,
I shrank from pointed prattle—
Wives may sew buttons on your shirt,
But yet they’re kittle-cattle.
Tis best to live in single bliss,
In lodgings snug and shady ;
I did not mean to ask my Miss
To be a married lady.
This good resolve I tried to keep
(You see, she hadn’t brothers),
But 0, alas ! 1 fell asleep
One night at Kitty’s mother’s.
■Twas just the chance a woman loves ;
She had been wont to joke me,
And say she’d “ win a pair of gloves ”
Her fond caress awoke me.
I scarce had left the land o’ dreams
Where, facts and fancies mingle;
A kiss at such a moment seems
To make your fingers tingle.
The figure bending o’er my chair
Looked tempting, plump and cosy,
There came a perfume from her hair
As from a summer posy.
I saw a pair of laughing eyes,
A neck as white as lilies,
I seized her hand (the smallest size)
And vowed, like other sillies,
That she was all the world to me—
The rest is easy guessing.
The maiden sat upon my knee
Whilst “ Ma ” bestowed her blessing.
As Adam found before the Ball,
There’s One above disposes
The destiny of each and all,
Though foolish man proposes.
I lull our baby on my lap
To slumber with this ditty ;
My cards are played, I took a nap—
And so I’ve taken Kitty,
E.F.

A N.S. W. Daily Hansard.
Dear Bulletin,— Does not the intense interest shown i n
the Labour members of the N.S.W. Assembly emphasise
the necessity for a daily edition of Hansard? How is it
possible for the democracy to form an intelligent judg-
ment of the Labour members if that judgment is to be
based upon inadequate or inaccurate accounts of the
debates ? True, a weekly, and often a bi-weekly, edition
of Hansard, is published; but this, though excellent in
itself, is only of use for the purposes of record, as public
opinion has already been moulded by the partisan or
crudely condensed reports in the capitalistic press. Is it
not essential, therefore, to the spread of true democracy
that prompt publicity should be given to the whole of the
parliamentary debates ? No person who has not access to
the House can possibly appreciate the deportment of the
Labour members. And, under any circumstances, but a
microscopically small section of the public can be
accommodated in the galleries, owing to want of
room. All chance of misrepresentation of motives
and formation of wrong opinions could be avoided
by the issue every morning of the official report
of the preceding night’s debate. And in this res-
pect New South Wales would be only following the lead of
the Argentine Republic, Belgium, Denmark, Hungary,
Italy, Spain, United States, Queensland, South Australia,
and Canada. No obstacle stands in the way of this demo-
cratic reform but the opposition of officialdom and
capitalism. That a daily Hansard is practicable at a
small additional expense is already admitted. For in 1887
a select committee of the Assembly, of which Mr.
Carruthers was chairman, reported that “it is expedient
to print, publish, and circulate a daily issue of Hansard.”
The motion for the adoption of the report was defeated in
a thin House by 33 to 22; the opposition emanating,
mainly from such representatives of capitalism and class-
dom as Burdekin, Burns, Chapman, Foster, Hawken,
F. Smith, W. Stephen, and other men now rejected
of the people. The difficulty of circulation was
to have been overcome with the aid of one of the
Sydney dailies ; and, speaking on this point, the manager
of the Daily Telegraph said it would cost the colony
£5OOO for printing and circulating the Hansard with any
leading Sydney newspaper “ for a minimum period of
A PIECE OF NEWS.
HE (midship-“mitc”): “You know" we often lave as many as fifty invitations for the
same evening in England, don’tchewno ! ”
SHE (Australian): “Really? I didn’t know they asked the children !”
about four months; with five days sitting each week."
The question is being revived in the Assembly by Mr:
Hutchison, the Opposition member for Glen Innes; and
it is to be hoped that the labour members will support
en bloc a proposition which, while costing but compara-
tively little to the country, will put the people in touch
with the members; will sustain critical interest in all
legislative utterances, will prevent a lot of waste of
time by making reiteration of speeches a thing of the
past, will ensure to the public a full representation of
their views in the Parliament, and will, on the whole,
wonderfully facilitate the business of Parliament. The
circulating of a daily Hansard in leading news-
papers would be of infinite advantage to every
newspaper reader, as it would put the other daily
papers on their mettle, and the competition would lead
to the abolition of the present inadequate, inaccurate and
often partial reports of the press, which now mislead the
public as to the true course of public events, and the
opinions and the tactics of the leading members in the
people’s Chamber. And, if it be deemed expedient, even
a free circulation of a daily Hansard could be obtained
with every metropolitan daily. Nor what is to prevent
the legislature, as a small return for free railway and
postal services by the Slate, from enacting that in every
newspaper published in Sydney there shall be issued, as an
inset or supplement, a copy of the daily Hansard, to be
supwlied by the State printer ?—Yours, Democrat.
Sydney D.T. tells us that the other Satur-
day night, during “the rush of cabs and other
vehicles in William-street, after the theatres, A
collision took place between Forbes and Dowling-
streets.” Saturday night— hie —always was a bad
night for reporting.
Dr. Magee, York Archbishop, died a
pauper, through having to pay £7OOO for the.fees
of translation, Peterborough to York. The Bishop
of Carlisle complains that he had to pay a sine-
cure, named Petty Bag, £l6O for sealing three
documents. The sinecurists, the Barnacles, who
come out of their shells for ecclesiastical jobs, are
named Green Seal, Red Lion, Blue Tiger, and so
on. Even Wales complained to his mother because
Victor was robbed of £4OOO over being made Duke
of Clarence. Magee wouldn’t have minded —if he
hadn’t died.
The Governor of Moscow has consented to
relax the anti-Hebrew decrees so far as to except a
number of Jewish girls, now studying at the
University there, from the general expulsion.
By way of smoothing down the difficulty the
ladies in question have been entered in the police
books as “abandoned women,” and have been
furnished with lodgings in houses of ill-fame.
According to Russian law a fallen woman is not
supposed to be of any religion, therefore she is
exempt from all regulations levelled against any
particular sect. In case, however, the whole of
the Hebrew population should take refuge under
this law it is necessary, as a rule, for the applicant
to satisfy the authorities that her morals are
sufficiently decayed before she can be registered ; if
she doesn’t seem bad enough to fill the bill she
has to go. In the present case, however, the
Governor has kindly guaranteed the bad character
of the applicants.
The Australian Republic conies nearer.
The electors of Wagga vociferously cheered Rae,
M.P., when he called for cheers for the Republic,
and every labour victory shoves Imperialism
deeper down in its grave. The Australian Demo-
cracy will have a hard fight though, and every
man who wants to keep his brain and body in
such trim that all the-most arduous and mental
labours cannot affect them, will have to use the
Bethel Electric Medical Baths, Lonsdale-street,
Melbourne. This particular system of electricity
is a proven cure for digestive, circulatory, nervous
and cutaneous ailments. And that is the reason
why the Imperial Eederationists are looking pur-
blindly towards .
The prospectus of the Sydney Deposit
Bank, whose director is Mr. T. S. Richardson, lies
before us. This institution has introduced a
novelty for public use in the shape of deposit-
notes, which can be purchased by anyone without
giving name or address, while transferrable with-
out endorsement, therefore can be paid away or
given as security, while bearing.interest at a high
rate during the time of currency. These notes are
issued from £lO upwards for any term at the fol-
lowing rates : 12 months, 7 per cent. ; 0 months, 0
par cent. ; 3 months, 5 per cent. But special rates
can be procured for longer or shorter periods.
The Bank on fixed deposits allows for 3 years, !H
percent. ; 12 months, 8g per cent. ; 6 months, 7|
percent. ; 3 months, 5| percent., and during the
last four years a bonus of 1 per cent, has been paid
toiall depositors in addition to the current rates on
their deposits. This is the only Bank in Austra-
lasia.that thus divides its profits.
RHEUMATISM versus MICROBE
KILLER.
294 Castleresgh-street, June 25, 1891.
Radam’s Microbe Killer Co., Gentlemen, —For
forty years I have been a sufferer from rheu-
matism, and latterly in the most aggravated form,
often having acute attacks which made me almost
helpless for days, insomuch that it was with the
greatest pain and difficulty that I could move
about at all, and only able to get up stairs on my
hands and knees. A friend who had tried the
“ Microbe Killer ” with beneficial results sent me
a jar of the medicine, which I took, and I have
now taken three jars of “Microbe Killer” and
the result has been a great wonder to myself and
my friends, for now I can get about freely, with-
out pain. I go up and down stairs without any
trouble, and I am greatly improved in health
every way. In fact my suffering from rheumatism
seems a thing of the past, and I can recommend
the “ Microbe Killer ” to anyone with confidence,
knowing what it has done for me. Several have
tried your medicine on my recommendation for
other diseases—and one a cancer patient—with
the same beneficial results. —Yours respectfully,
MRS. WHITAKER.

Two Men Wrong-One Man Right.
“ You will he in kingdom-come in less than tivelve
months ! ”
“ You can’t live three years !■ ”
“ You are not going to die ! ”
These three prophecies were addressed to the
same man. The last one had the most comfort in
it, yet he couldn’t tell which had the most inspira-
tion.
Here’s the story. It isn’t pleasant reading at
first, but it “ comes out ” all right, as the children
say.
Perhaps it’s better to let our friend tell it him-
self. We all like the pronoun “I,” that’s why
an autobiography is never dull. This relator is a
butcher of Auckland, N. Z., and his style is so
clear and good, it needs no editing.
He says : “ Some five years ago, when lifting a
quarter of beef, I noticed a remarkable soreness in
the small of my back. I called a doctor, gave up
business, and took to my bed. He prescribed a
lotion to be rubbed in around the region of the
kidneys. This was done, and I remained in bed
several days, suffering excrutiating agony. At
last, having examined the kidney secretions, the
doctor said, ‘ You have Bright’s disease, and will
be in kingdom-come in less than twelve months.’
“ Never believing I had Bright’s disease, I
thought, however, it would be as well to insure
my life. On examination, the company’s physician
refused to pass me for life insurance, saying,
‘ You can’t live three years.’
“ About three months afterwards I was again
seized with a severe attack, and went about more
dead than alive. Finally I broke down and again
took to my bed, as was supposed, for the last
time. I sold one of my businesses so as not to
leave too many affairs for my wife to sunervise,
made my will, and explained to my wife what to
do in case of my death. I can well remember her
listening v ith tears in her eyes to what she be-
lieved were my last instructions. I then lingered
for some weeks, waiting for death to free me from
my sufferings —taking whatever medicines were
prescribed, but deriving little or no relief.
“One evening a friend called, and we talked
over my case and the very serious turn it had
taken. Presently he said, ‘ You are not going to
die. Have you tried Seigel’s Syrup yet ?’
“I confessed that I had not. In fact, I had
religiously followed the instructions of my medical
advisers. My friend persuaded me to try Seigel’s
Syrup, and I began at once, taking twenty-drop
doses according to the directions. In about a
week I felt a little more life in me, and after
having finished the second bottle I was convinced
that improvement had fairly set m. I continued
taking the Syrup until I had consumed ten bottles,
then went downstairs to work again, still using
the Syrup. After having taken from eighteen to
twenty bottles altogether, I found myself entirely
well. It is now four years since I took my last
dose of Mother Seigel’s Syrup for Bright’s disease
of the kidneys, and I have suffered no symptoms
of kidney complaint since.
“(Signed) Robert Hutchinson, Butcher.
Wellington-'street, Auckland, New Zealand.”
We print Mr. Hutchinson’s statement as he
wrote it, yet it is not probable that his malady
was actually Bright’s disease, as that is a degenera-
tion or destruction of the substance of the kidneys,
and difficult, if not impossible, to cure. What he
really suffered from was, no doubt, a debilitated
state of the system, originating in indigestion and
dyspepsia, with severe kidney symptoms, as is often
the case. When we remember that nearly all
maladies, including rheumatism, gout, consump-
tion, liver complaint, heart disease, &o., are due
to poisons in the blocd, arising from fermented
food in the digestive tract, we can see why Mother
Seigel’s Syrup is victorious over so great a variety
of apparently diverse diseases. And because of
the one source of these complaints, serious and
often fatal mistakes are made in the diagnosis and
in the treatment. The point to emphasise is this :
Heart disease, consumption, and Bright’s disease
are much rarer than they are supposed to be.
Generally what seems like them is a group of
symptoms of indigestion and dyspepsia. It is
always best to take the advice of Mr. Hutchinson’s
friend when he said, “ You are not going to die ;
try Seigel's Syrup.”

THE GREAT REMEDY FOR PAIN.
ST.JACOBS OIL.
WHAT IT IS.
SIX STANDARD VIRTUES.
Ist. It is in one word a cure; it is not merely
a relief, and in no sense a cure all ; it is the
product of scientific research.
2nd. It strengthens while it soothes 'and sub-
dues, heals, and cures; it literally conquers pain.
3rd. Its effects are curative and permanent to
the whole group of muscular miseries and nervous
agonies.
4th. It does not merely irritate the outer
surface, nor does it merely soften or relax a con-
stricted muscle. To its specific action a superior
curative virtue is supperadded.
sth. It penetrates deeply but gently; search-
ingly and surely seeking the pain spot in an effort
to conquer.
6th. Each constituent of the formula has a
recognised intrinsic virtue to serve most surely
the cure of pain.
For rheumatism, neuralgia, sprains, bruises,
stiff joints, swellings, and similar ailments, St.
Jacobs Oil has positively no equal if used accord
ing to the directions which accompany each bottle.
Aches and pains succumb in a truly marvellous
manner to the potent influence of this world-famed
remedy. Thousands of testimonials have, from
time to time been published in the Australian
press—testimonials from all ranks and conditions
of men—from statesmen, judges, eminent divines,
barristers, the medical profession, merchants,
athletes, &0., and although a large standing
reward has been offered to any one who could
produce proof that any one of these was not
strictly genuine, none have dared to question
their authenticity. Under these circumstances is
it to be wondered at that the sale of St. Jacobs
Oil greatly exceeds the combined sales of all other
advertised lotions, liniments, embrocations, &c.,
in the world ? No home can afford to be without
a bottle of it always handy, and purchasers would
do well to observe that they get the genuine
article and not one of the many spurious prepara-
tions made up to trade upon the enormous reputa-
tion which St. Jacobs Oil has built up for itself
upon the solid foundation of merit.
ON EXPLOSIONS GENERALLY.
A pre-arranged explosion of anything or any-
body is a tame, insipid, and unpractical method
of attracting attention unless it is carried out on a
very large scale with the usual holiday accompani-
ments of feathers, stars, music, and millinery;
and not always even then unless the unexpected
happens, and something or somebody is blown up
that was intended to remain a fixture either in the
shape of a landmark, or as a permanent ornament
to the pension list of the country. The latter,
however, rarely if ever happens, and when it does
it is sure to be the recipient of a sum of not more
than Is per diem, who goes the highest and has
his remains distributed over the largest part of
the earth’s surface. The first-class pensioner
knows too mujh to incur any needless risk, and is
never in danger of being blown up by anything
more deadly than the internal disturbances pro-
duced by over indulgence in the pleasure of the
table. Of explosive guns that can never be
absolutely depended on to exnlode twice in the
direction of the enemy or any other target, the
colonies have recently had one or two sad ex-
periences, for which somebody might deserve to
lie hanged if it were only possible to get at the
extreme truth; and the same penalty would fit
nicely into the life-mosaic of the genius who not
very long ago invented non-explosive cartridges
filled with sawdust, only on the ground that it
left him a larger margin of profit on his liitie con-
tract. The explosive torpedo, which goes off in
the tube of the attacking ship instead of waiting
until it arrives just underneath the counter of the
foe, and the simple-looking but mature egg which
fulfils its mission in the corner of the eye of the
patriot who is burning to save his country at the
ridiculously low figure of £3OO per annum and a
railway pass, are both equally destructive in
degree, though only one is positively deadly. The
large, angular, carnation-colored iady, with the
gentle-natured mild husband who is always in
the wrong, is an explosive of another type, but
not in the least degree less vicious ; the area
of her iufluence being circumscribed the scatter-
ing force of her fireworks is especially energetic,
and has a most disastrous effect on every living
thing within the range of its baneful influence,
but that range being bounded by the front
door-step on one side and the back gate in
the right-of-way on the other, it has no
particular interest for anybody outside her own
family circle, except for the neighbor’s small boy
who sits on the fence and casually remarks that
“Old man, Johnny, is a ketchin’ of it agin.”
But there is one other domestic explosive that
demands the attention of all Christian people, and
that is low-grade kerosene. It is almost as
impossible to calculate with any degree of certainty
what this will do, or when and how it will do it,
as it is to find out why it does it without any
known or discoverable provocation. One minute
all is peace, comfort, and happiness, and the next
fond hearts have been severed for aye, and time-
payment furniture that it has taken years to
collect is scattered to the four winds of heaven,
and the trusting husband and father comes home
from his work in the evening to find nothing but
a huge chasm in the earth, where he left a happy
home and a united family with a black and gold 1 '
piano and a sewing machine, and a yard full of
poultry in the morning. This has happened,
frequently ; but it need never do so again. The
safeguard against its recurrence is the use of
Luxene, the new illuminant, as a substitute for
deadly oils. Luxene could not bring misery into
the world if it wanted to. Nothing but bliss and
a direct saving of money follows in its track, and
it affords the most soo.hing and beautiful light
known to the wise men and women of to-day.

POINTS
Jhe W.A. Parliament assembles for its

There are 18 more Protectionists than
Freetraders in the N.S.W. Assembly.
Ninian Melville is an aspirant for the
Leadership of the N.S.W. Opposition.
The Victorian railways lose £lOOO a day.
Minister Shiels is apparently the man of the hour.
The Swiss Republic has been established
COO years, and the President’s salary is £6OO a
Parkes, who commenced life as a Chartist,
will be forced to end it as a Socialist. So pro-
phesies The (N.Q.) Republican.
Some members of the N.S.W. Legislative
Prmnoil though not sworn in, still use the railway-
pass and travel “ on the nod ” on the trams.
It was the late Stephen Campbell Brown,
not Thomas Garrett, as asserted who fathered
the £ 40-deposit clause in the N.S.W. Electoral
A °u rpj ie on iy honest Freetrader in the
NSW Parliament is G. H. Reid, who says that
Federation must bring Protection.’’—Miller,
M.L.A. „ , ,
The British fleet actually cost the Aus-
tralia® £14,000 a year more than if it were built-
manned and controlled by Australians as a nur-
sery of Australian sailors.
No wonder Treasurer M £ Millan resigns.
Every nerve and fibre of his being must revolt
against the bearing-rein of the Labour-party and
the temporising of Parkes.
“What the Labour-party is going for is
democratic measures in the interest of Australia,
T wouldn’t care if Beelzebub himself gave

As showing the new (Labour) party’s im-
portance in the N.S.W. Assembly no one now
addresses the chair or the House. They all talk
directly towards and at the Mountain.
Alaiming cable.: £30,000 N.S.W. stock
sold out, because of the local Labour movement—
to be invested, no doubt, in Argentine, Honduras,
Egyptian, Turkish or Portuguese bonds.
°The N.S. Wales Labour-party haven’t
pardoned Parkes. They have only reprieved him.
He is working with a rope round his neck. And
so are Dibbs and Co., if they only knew it.
Thus Samuel Tomkinson, M.P. (S.A.):—
Tie working-classes are not taxpayers, they do not pay
taxes in the ordinary sense. As for Customs duties, the
wages their employers pay them furnish them with the
means.
If any member of the N.S.W. Labour-
party now takes office (and especially if he fails to
put his extra earnings into the Labour Electoral
fund) he will accept a personal bribe pure and
simple.
“ If Mr. Brown had been elected for New-
castle, which he hasn’t, and if I had become
N.S.W. Premier, which I haven’t, Mr. Brown
would have been my Colonial Treasurer, which he
isn’t.”— Dibbs.
Premier Munrope says that “ some of the
Victorian unemployed have been found to be the
owners of freehold property.” The Bulletin
presumes that Munrope refers to the big land-
lords.
Another by-election has been won by the
Gladstonians. The English Tories have notoriously
prolonged the existence of a decaying Parliament
in the hope of wearing out Gladstone’s life before
appealing to the country.
The present utterances of the Australian
Star addressed to the N.S.W. Labour-party fall
on deaf ears and are regarded not as bona-fide
democratic warnings, but as the ravings of politi-
cians hungry for office.
Shoulfl Bilke be elected he will sit as a
Privy Councillor and ex-Oabinet Minister, and
will thus have the right to a place on the front
Opposition bench, shoulder to shoulder with Mr.
Gladstone and Sir William Harcourt.
Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan’s proposal that
Governor Jersey shall summon 10 Labour men to
the N.S.W. Legislative Council is utterly ridicu-
lous so long as no provision is made for the pay-
ment of their Parliamentary expenses.
N.S.W. Speaker Abbott has undergone a
change in his deportment. He is striving, with
some success, to be courteous and considerate to
all members. In the last Parliament he fell under
the impression that he was Parliament.
Lord Chief Justice Coleridge : “ It is not
intimidation to persuade men to leave work.’
Thanks —though we knew it all the time, but
hardly any Australian Judge would have the
hardihood to say it—before an English Judge had
said it.
“ Erak Berry saw clearly enough that if
the Victorian Legislative Council became elective,
on a basis approaching that of the Assembly, it
would claim equal powers. So he was all for a
mere Nominee House, failing which he threw up
the sponge.
The Bulletin again loudly asks the pro-
hibition cranks what they mean to do with the
vineyards of Australia when the State, at their
instance, vetoes the importation or manufacture
of alcoholic liquor? A clear and reassuring answer
on this question is wanted.
The Amalgamated Miners’ Association of
Australia, sitting in conference at Ballarat, have
adopted a political platform, practically that of
the N.S. Wales’ Labour Electoral League. Its
first plank is electoral reform, its last, federation
on the basis of one-man-one-vote.
The Sydney Echo (the S.M. Herald’s
evening pup), in a leaded article, threatens the
Australian labour bodies with Pinkerton guards—
i.e., with military bodies paid by and
used to coerce people who rebel against Free Com-
petition and liberty to starve. We smile.
The election of J. L. Stirling to Adelaide
Legislative Council again shows the power of
labour, although this time defeated. The capi-
talists spent over £2OOO to get their man in, and
the other candidate, a poor man, only came in a
few hundred votes behind him —despite the pro-
perty qualification for voters!
“ If there is any one thing in our whole
social economy that requires sweeping away with
the besom of destruction it is our legal system.
Reform of it is out of the question, for it presents
a stubborn front of resistance, and nothing can be
done with it but batter it down and walk over
it.”—S.M. Herald, 22nd July, 1891.
Apropos the suggestion that Parkes
should appoint one of the Labour members to one
of the two or more vacant portfolios in his Govern-
ment, The Bulletin just wishes to observe that
the Labour-party, as it can do no good with one
or two portfolios, should not accept them. When
the moment comes, they must clutch the lot.
As soon as the Local Government Bill is put
through the N.S.W. Assembly, and the first nail
is driven well home into the political coffins of the
Dowels, the Bowmans, the Dangars, and the
Tonkins, an effort will be made to squelch Parkes’
great vote-controlling machine—the demoralising
paid Parliamentary Public Works Committee.
The total population of Western Australia
on sth April, 1891, was 49.835. The total popula-
tion in 1881 was 29,708. Increase during the
decade, 20,127 —or over 67 per cent. The W.A.
population in 1870 was 24,785, and in 1859, 14,837.
In the census just taken all aboriginals were
rigidly excluded. These are estimated to exceed
5000.
Munro says he will hand over the Vic-
torian unemployed to the Assembly (bound hand
and foot, one presumes), but they will hand them-
selves, and Munro too, over to the next Assembly.
Southey went to a noble lord for a subscription,
and, said the N.L.: “Literature can take care of
itself.” Southey; “Yes, and of you, too.”
The N.S.W. Assembly is likely to sanction
a daily Hansard ; but, to avoid any failures, it
should re-arrange the Government reporting work
so as to confine the Hansard staff to their legiti-
mate duties, which is the reporting of the Parlia-
mentary debates. The present system suits the
comfort, the convenience, and the pocket of only
one man.
The recent statement that Tom Glassey,
Labour M.P., of Queensland, has, since his elec-
tion, got two of his sons into the Queensland Civil
Service, is incorrect. One of the Glasseys entered
the service in ’B5, while his father was not elected
till ’BB. The other was billeted in ’B9 at the enor-
mous salary of 17s. 6d. per week, since increased
to £l.
The House of Lords has ruled that the
fact of men continuing to work at dangerous occu-
pations does not in itself forfeit their rights to
recover damages for injury by accident. This is
a foul blow at “freedom of contract’’—the men
need not work unless they like. They have the
option of starving. The House of Lords has been-
converted into a tyranny.
R. W. Best, M.L.A., of Victoria, recently
essayed to address a meeting of theA.N.A. on
“ Federation,” Premier Munro and Deakin being
present. When Best declared that, iftider the
Convention Bill, the Senate would become Aus-
tralia’s House of Lords, he was howled down for
that evening. Munro got “riled” because the
cat was out of the bag, and Deakin’s face was a
ghastly revelation.
Strenous efforts are being made by the
Victorian white-waistcoat party to defeat Labour
at the general elections. Scene : bank-parlour.
Manager (to clerk): “ How long have you been in
the colony, Mr. Shortage ? ” “Two years, sir. : ’
“Very well. Go and get an electoral right at
once. The bank will bear the expense and will
give you a day’s leave. I hope you will vote
against those who wish to disturb the condition of
society.”
The programme of the Bible in State
Schools’ League formed the text of special sermons
in most of the Queensland Protestant churches
last Sunday. The Protestant churches now find
that they have cut their noses to spite their faces.
With what enthusiasm did they in each province
support the movement for free, secular, and com-
pulsory education out of their hatred for the
Romans ! Now that they try to drive back they
find big trees across the track.
W. A. West-Erskine, who, as per cable,
has been slandering Australia and the Australian
workmen, made a pile out of Broken Hills. This
potentate was for years about the most unpopular
member of S.A. Legislative Council, and resigned
chiefly because he would have been ignominiously
defeated at the recent elections by the very
Labour-party he abuses, notwithstanding the pro-
perty qualification that shuts out half the toilers
from voting.
S. A, Parliament, having affirmed the
principle of eight hours labour, the heads of Civil
Service department were instructed to devise a
scheme for effectuating the system. They now
report that it is impossible for railway engine-
drivers to work exactly eight hours every day, as
they must in certain cases take trains on long
trips. Other absurd arguments are dished up.
These brilliant geniuses don’t understand that all
that Labour asks for is 48 hours a week, parcelled
out in terms as near eight hours as possible, about
which there is no difficulty at all.
Federation literature will receive avaluable
addition —when it suits Parkes’ vanity. He has
had put in type all the despatches that have
passed between Downing-street and Government
House and Hampton Villa; but these important
State papers are being withheld from Parliament
—until Parkes’ literary trumpeter has exhausted
their contents in the interest of an edition-de-luxc
of the Convention records, in which his Federa-
tion labours will be extolled as highly as it will be
seemly for a literary Civil servant to beslobber his
political patron. Will the N.S.W. Assembly con-
sider the Commonwealth Bill in the absence of
these public, not Parkesian, papers ?
Arthur Rutledge, M.L.A. (Q.), favours
the proposed second-ballot system for the extra-
ordinary reason that its adoption in France and
Germany had “enabled those countries to stem
the tide of political socialism which otherwise
would have inundated them. ” This is about the
blindest attempt at seeing nothing ex-parson and
lawyer Rutledge has ever made. France is
solidly Republican, while Germany hasn’t yet
stemmed any tide worth mentioning, except that
of human blood, and is as honeycombed with
socialism —even in its Parliament—as Rutledge’s
skull is with fallacies. All the “stemming” (of
the Rutledge brand) ever yet done anywhere has
been effected by the injustice of plural voting.
There are more Socialists in Germany than in any
other country in the world, and in France the ten-
dency towards Communistic-Anarchy is equally
strong.

The following testimonials from ministers, doctors, and private persons speak for them-
selves and they are but a drop in the bucket of the thousands received :
The distinguished pulpit-orator and evangelist,
Rev, Miles Grant, Boston, Mass., writes,
October 7; , .
“ *** Touching your wonderful discovery, I take much
pleasure in saying, “I am delighted with its effects upon
my system. I sent for it that I might know its influence
on a healthy person. I have now used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life. The treatment produces a general refreshing, in-
vigorating effect; sharpens my appetite, sweetens my
sleep, and makes me feel as though I had a new lease of
life. I have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
I have heard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, ‘ I would not
take $5O for it. It knocks the bottom out of disease. I
can say for myself I never spent cash to better advantage
than when I bought your pamphlet. —Your brother in
'Christ, Miles Grant.”
Dr. J, W. Graves, Parsons, Kansas, writes :
“Dear Dr. Hall,— After a careful reading of your
pamphlet, which came to hand a few weeks ago, I became
so delighted with the far-reaching effects of its marvellous
physiological revelations, that I at once ordered six of my
patients, who were suffering with consumption, to com-
mence the use of the treatment. lam happy to say that
they are all improving and doing well. You have done a
great work for afflicted humanity.—Your fraternal friend,
J. W. Graves, M.D.”
Rev. Thos. Nield, Livonia, Ind., writes :
“At the time I received your pamphlet on Health and
Longevity, I was suffering from internal piles. After
putting your treatment into practice three times I bade
my trouble good-b3'e, and have not felt it since. I have
only to add, from practical experience, during the short
time I have owned your pamphlet, that 1 have more faith
in your system of treatment than in all the medicines of
all the doctors on earth combined. —Yours very truly,
Thos. Nield.”
Rev. A. L. Cole, D.D., M.D., Santa Ana, Cal.,
sends his second endorsement of the new pam-
phlet after another month’s practice of the treat-
ment, as follows;
“ Dear Dr. Hall,— l have nothing to take back from
my letter as printed in the July ‘Microcosm.’ Your
treatment is the first expression of the science of thera-
peutics I have ever seen in print, or have ever put
into practice that appeals to my judgment as unquali-
fiedly rational. It goes directly to the cause of all forms
of disease and removes it by aiding and abetting nature,
rather than provoking a conflict among the vital powers
as in the case of drug-medication. This I call genuine
remedial science. For nearly twenty-five years I have
been a consecutively tormented invalid, and I can say in
all candour and truth that the first real freedom from suf-
fering that I have experienced in all this time has been
since adopting your treatment. I rejoice beyond words
within my power of expression ; and I honestly believe
that under God you have done more in that pamphlet
than all the doctors of the world for the relief of suffering
humanity. The treatment in my own case is to me the
wonder of wonders ! The $4 I paid for the pamphlet was
the best spent money of my whole life. You are at liberty
to print this, which I declare to be the literal truth upon
the honour of a man and a Christian. God bless you in
your beneficent work.”—A. L. Cole.
Rev. Geo. Cook, of Millican, Texas, who was
struck with what the doctors supposed to be a
fatal paralytic shock, now sends his seventh order
for pamphlets, and writes ;
“ Dear Friend, Dr. Hall,— lnclosed find the money for
three more pamphlets with pledges signed My health is
now quite restored. Others here who have sent for the
pamphlet are just beginning to try the treatment, and
alLare pleased with it. I will report further soon, and
send for a number of pamphlets.—Yours truly, George
Cook."
Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus allowing
nature herself to do her work unimpeded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a “ Pledge of Honor ” from those purchas-
ing it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
of their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
rights in the discovery can be ma’ntained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
Dr. J. M. Peebles, whose Sanitorium, as the
centre of his enormous medical practice, is at
Hammonton, N.J., and who admittedly is one of
the most learned physicians and surgeons now
living, has sent for our pamphlet and has received
it as a physiological revelation. He writes;
“Your health pamphlet dropped in upon me like a
healing ray of sunshine. I read it with avidity, and at
once put your treatment into practice, and it is scarcely
necessary to say I found it all you recommended it to be
and more. It is not only pathological, physiological, and
hygienic, but rational. Already have I derived great
personal benefit from your discovery.—Truly yours, J.
M. Peebles, M.D.”
[Dr. Peebles is a graduate of several medical collegesi
has circumnavigated the earth three times in the interests
of therapeutical and pathological science, and is the
author of eleven volumes on the subject, the last being
“How to Live a Century and Grow Old Gracefully”—a
work which we have read with profound interest." The
indorsement of our pamphlet and treatment by such a
distinguished authority surely needs no comment.]
llev. M. Forlisler, Scliafferstown, Pa., writes :
“ Dr. A. Wilford Hall. Dear Sir, —Since receiving
your pamphlet I have carefully tested your treatment
upon myself. For more than twenty years I have been a
sufferer. My trouble has been torpid liver, indigestion,
pain across the kidneys, at times dizziness, with
occasional heart trouble, &c. With gladness unspeakable
I assure you I already find myself almost a new man ; and
I can never pay the debt of gratitude I owe you for the
blessing you have conferred upon me. I want to help
spread the knowledge of this discovery, and if you wifi
send me some blank Pledges of Honor -1 will let my
afflicted neighbours know about the great remedy that is
in store for them.—Yours very truly, M. Fernslbr.”
DR. R. F. STEVENS’INDORSEMENT,
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment—
more than 20 years ago. In writing to a friend,
about a year ago, he gives the following
***** “Nearly twenty years ago in this city Dr. A.
Wilford Hall gave me privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered and adopted some
twenty years before, and which he had practised con-
tinuously upon himself up to that time. The history
included an account of the failure of the health, the
reasonings and conclusions which led him to adopt the
treatment, his rapid restoration to health, &c. From the
time of his first mention of it to me I have been entirely
satisfied that it saved him from a lingering consumption
and death ; and that in the years following, as I have evi-
dence to satisfy me, its continued practice has so affected
the nutrient and eliminating functions as to give to his
physical structure a greater degree of solidity, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. I learn that he has persistent!v
continued the treatment to the present time-forty years
in all—and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the ‘ bloom of youth,’
though he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in ray prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due to him for
whatever scientific advances he may be able to unfold in
the line of assisting nature to ward off disease, and in the
restoration of health.— R. F. 'Stevens, M.D.”
Rev. M. A. Smith, pastor M.E. Church, South,
at McAlester, Ind. Ter., writes :
“ Inclosed please find signed pledge of Rev. \V. H.
Hicks, our Congregational minister, and the money for
his pamphlet. * * * I am not a bit surprised to see in
the June ‘Microcosm’ the wonderful things your new
discovery is accomplishing for those who have tried the
treatment. I want to tell you with tears of joy what it
has done for my wife. For about a year she has been
regarded as a hopeless consumptive. Our physicians had
given her up as incurable. She had patiently and reso-
lutely tried all sorts of medicines recommended by
different friends, when your pamphlet arrived. She at
once read it with me, and we became fully convinced as
to the soundness of your reasoning. Without loss of time
she proceeded to adopt your remedy, and now what words
can I employ to express our happiness over the result ?
* * * She commenced to improve in strength and flesh
immediately, and so marvellous has been the change that
she now weighs as much as ever she did ! Praise God,
and thanks to you, Dr. Hall. The dark cloud has been
lifted from our sky.—Your grateful friend, M. A. Smith.
Alison C. Roe, Esq., Buchanan, Mich., writes :
“ Dear Dr. Hall,—l have received and read your won-
derful pamphlet on health and longevity, i am very
thankful that I was somewhat acquainted with your
writings, having read the ‘Problem of Human Life’ and
some numbers of the earlier volumes of the ‘ Microcosm.’
Had 1 not known of you through your previous dis-
coveries in science 1 fear 1 should have given little atten-
tion to this great and priceless physiological discovery
w'hich is destined to do so much for suffering humanity.
You will hear from me again soon.—Respectfully yours,
Alison C. Rok.”

“Sent to Australia.”
Dear Bulletin, —In a recent issue of The Bul.
letin was a paragraph of two lines only. It
referred to some poor wretch who was being sent
to Australia for his health. He was suffering
from consumption. That was all, and to the
casual reader conveyed nothing more than the
fact stated. But to me it had more than a pass-
ing interest, for it was but one example of ten
thousand others, each one a tragedy in itself.
# # ' *
Ten years ago I came in a sailing-ship bound for
Australia. We had twelve passengers on board,
six of these in more or less advanced stages of
consumption. They all told pretty much the
same tale. Poor clerks or mechanics, Algiers
or any other resort of wealthy consumptives
was impossible for them. They must go where
t hey could earn their living, so they had been sent
to Australia to earn their living—if they could,
and recover —if possible. To each one, also, hi 8
medical adviser had said, “Go by sailing-ship,
the long sea-voyage will be so pleasant—and it is
cheaper.”
# # *
We were becalmed for a week in the doldrums,
and the moist heat of the Equator killed the
weakest of the six. In the high latitudes of the
Indian Ocean, in the region of the icebergs, there
was no more heat, but there was cold enough and
to spare. Day after day there were storms of
snow and heavy gales, the waves pouring over the
sides and washing the passengers out of thei r
cabins on deck. We were two months beating
from the Cape to Sydney, and in that time we
buried three more. The other two walked ashor e
to earn their living, for perhaps three months.
After that they would have no more need to
trouble.
* # *
A short time back I was sitting one evening in
the surgeon’s cabin of a mail-steamer. We were
coming down the Mediterranean, the night wa s
fine and it was the hour of tobacco and whisky
and soothing thoughts, but the surgeon was
cursing—for the want of a better simile —like any-
thing. He cursed the ship, and he cursed the
passengers, he cursed the directors and he cursed
his profession, and finally exhausted himself in
one almost inarticulate curse against the combined
medical faculty of Great Britain. Then, some-
what calmer, he stated his grievance. It was his
fourth voyage, and always the same experience.
So many consumptives in the second - class,
so many in the steerage sent to Australia
to earn their living—or die. “ It is not as
though it did them any good,” he continued, “or
I wouldn’t mind, but the sea voyage can’t—the
changes of climate are too great and too sudden.
You know that it can’t, and I know that it can’t,
and dozens of others know the same. It is the
blithering idiots at home who send them out to
get rid of them, that don’t know and won’t learn.
We lost three last trip, and I guess we shall lose
four this.” We were luckier than this, however,
for we only buried two, and the rest were landed
to add to the strength and sinew of the popula-
tion—while they lived.
# * *
So much for the sea-voyage, but how about
those who survive it ?
* # *
I was riding one morning over the Downs in
Western Queensland. I had started early, bound
for a neighbouring station, and although well
within the tropics it was bitterly cold. There
had been a sharp frost at sunrise, and crossing the
ti-tree gullies a thick mist hung about that pierced
through to the very bones. Presently I overtook
a horseman. The leather leggings and slouch hat
proclaimed the jackeroo, the seat denoted the
new-chum. Riding side by side—for we were
bound for the same destination—l took stock of
my companion. Thin and haggard there was no
doubt about his case—the hacking cough, which
the bitter morning air brought on in paroxysms,
betrayed that plainly enough. He told me his
story. A clerk in London, sent out by the doctor
with a letter of introduction to a Melbourne
firm, passed on by them, as bookkeeper, to North
Queensland, “where it was always fine and
warm.” “There was ice in the hut last night,”
he continued, “ and it is not very warm now, but
I daresay I shall be better when the summer
comes.”
* * *
After breakfast I asked the manager at M
about his bookkeeper. For answer he took me
round to a small enclosure away behind the
station. In the enclosure there were three slabs
marked each one by a plain ironbark slab.
“Those,” he said, “ are the graves of three of my
bookkeepers, sent out from home for the sake of
the voyage, and sent up here for the sake of the
climate; the present man will be the fourth, and
after that, I’ll be d——d if I stand it any longer.
The blank fools at home and the blanker fools in
Melbourne don’t know what the climate is for a
man who has to work. They don’t turn this
station into a blank asylum for consumptives any
more. I’ll be getting the complaint myself
directly. ” When I passed M— — again, fourteen
weeks later, the fourth was there. And yet this
one had a better chance than most.
* * #
Now for the moral of all this. Year after year
shipload after shipload of pauper and quasi-pauper
consumptives are being brought to our shores. It
can do them no good, and it can do us no good,
and the only good it can do is to the (on this
point) ignorant fools who send them away to save
themselves further trouble. To the consumptive
of wealth Australia affords a climate where, with
suitable precaution in certain particular localities,
an absolute prolongation of life may be obtained ;
to the man who must work for his living, handi-
capped by a mortal disease, the climate is more
than usually fatal. The extremes of heat and
cold are greater than he has been accustomed to,
the life in the country where the consumptive
usually makes his way is one of greater privation,
and a speedier termination of the disease is the
inevitable result. Of the thousands that have
come here, there is probably not one single case
of established consumption where the slightest
benefit has accrued. And yet, to obtain this
absolutely negative result, what are the risks that
we take? Many bring children, the hereditary
poison already within them, to fructify in after
years. Many more have time to marry and have
children born to them ere they die, leaving a legacy
of disease behind them. There is already too great
a tendency to indigenous consumption among
many native-born Australians, that we should add
to the mischief by the gratuitous importation of
billions of tubercle germs'. Imbecile authorities
who become hysterically frantic over the possible
introduction of the mildest case of chicken-pox
should be forced to protect the people of the Aus-
tralias against the further introduction of the
most easily-detected and most dangerous disease
of all. —Yours, &c., George Dant.
A Generous Gift.
It matters not under what conditions of life we
are placed, in poverty or in wealth, there are
times when we look round for the means' to “get
away from ourselves.” This feeling may arise
through a desire to blot out for a time bid recol-
lections, to forget the “ skeleton in the cupboard,”
or to deaden passing troubles. With this aim in
view many means are resorted to which only too
frequently end in insanity and death. Amongst
these may be mentioned alcohol, tobacco, opium,,
henbane, hachish and absinthe, about which so
many terrible stories are told. Happily, however,
although the desire cannot be suppressed, the
right-thinking amongst us seek to satisfy our-
selves in a less harmful manner. In which
direction the patronage accorded to our local
theatres clearly shows. Music and the drama,
above everything else, create a feeling of satis-
faction and a much sought after forgetfulness of
self thatnothing else can approach, setting asidethe
permanent educational advantages that it must
also necessarily give. And yet how few there are
amongst us who, sitting night after night in our
box' or comfortably-cushioned dress-circle seat,
give five minutes’ thought after the performance
to those who so patiently administer to our plea-
sure and who so materially help us to forget the
troubles which are the penalty of our existence.
The present, much less the future, of the actors
and musicians are entirely lost sight of in our own
immediate thought of self, and yet no one denies
the hardships of their lives. During a recent
visit paid to Dunwich Asylum, Mr. Henry J.
Pollard, of the firm of H. J. Pollard and Co., who
is really one of the pioneers of music in Queens,
land, was surprised and grieved to find so many
old professionals, who had seen life in all its
phases, ending their days in almost cheerless soli-
tude. Born and educated in an atmosphere of
harmony and song, and in full possession of all
their musical faculties, they were totally without
the means of enjoying a pleasure they had
spent their best years in giving to us. Such is the
irony of fate, and so it struck Mr. Pollard
as he thought upon the happier and more
prosperous circumstances under which he had seen
them. Mr. Pollard’s visit to Dunwich has conse.
quently not been without its good results, for we
are informed that with the permission of the
Colonial Secretary he has presented the inmates
of that institution with a magnificent Hermann
Schroder piano. We do not wish to make any
comment on this generous gift, the spirit in which
it has been given speaks for itself. We announce
it in this public manner only with the hope that the
many visits paid during the year to this haven of
rest (to which anyone of us may come, and which
even now is filled up with old acquaintances) may
create in many the same emotions, and be pro-
ductive of the same good. We trust our few
remarks on Mr. Pollard’s generosity may not fall
upon unwilling ears, but may open the hearts of
the charitably-disposed to assist in “toning
down ” the evening of life for the “old boys” of
Dunwich.*
Bernhardt’s wonderful vitality can be
traced to one or two things. Either she has a
small electric battery instead of a heart, or she
paid fortnightly visits to the Bethel Electric
Medical Baths at Lonsdale-street during the cur-
rency of her Melbourne season.
J. and C. Howard, of Pitt-street, Sydney,
are the Australasian representatives of J. and F.
Howard Bedford, so well-known to agriculturists.
After some years of hard work, they have won
very important distinctions for many of their
manufactures such as have been deemed particu-
larly adapted for colonial use. Among these are
their “DiggingPloughs.” Now, practical plough-
men, everywhere, have had to withdraw their pre-
judices against the concave mouldboard and
broken work. The peculiar shape of the mould -
board enables it to pulverise the soil, and the
presser, a projection from the end of the
board, aiding in this work, also helps to
level the ploughed land and lay a good
seed bed. The metal of this board is the
hardest ever made, and has a gloss which
means greater cleaning power than every
other. The wings, or shares, of these ploughs are
fitted with reversible points of several patterns—
patents of the firm—which can be reversed in
order to allow the cutting edge to be always at the
bottom, and, when worn out, can be replaced for
half the cost of ordinary plough-shares. A small
mould-board and share placed in front of the
other effectually buries all weeds and rubbish.
The single-furrow digging ploughs are now fitted
with a large skeith coulter, which is intended to
out cornstalks previous to being buried by the
plough. This plan seems to have solved the great
difficulty of maize-farming. The Agricultural
College has been supplied recently with these
digging ploughs after an exhaustive trial. Messrs.
Howard’s safety enclosed horse-gears and patent
radial rising mouthpiece chaff-cutters are now
becoming well known and liked for their impor-
tant meehanical points. We advise our readers
to become conversant with modern implements of
agriculture by sending for the firm’s new cata-
logue—a valuable addition to the literature of any
farmer.

Faithful “Towzer.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The night was dark, His coat, behind.
Hidden each star ; The thief in vain
The watch-dog’s bark Strives to get free;
Was heard afar. He suffers pain,
The watchman’s tread Captivity.
Resounded plain ; A woeful cry
From overhead From the poor wight
Down poured the rain. Is raised on high
With head bowed down, At each fresh bite.
Soft-footed crept
Towards the town At last, a light
A thief adept. Is seen appear;
The watch-dog’s bark In garments slight
Is hushed and gone— A man draws near.
On mission dark Ho calls aloud
The thief creeps on, To one inside ;
But “ Towzer ” sniffs Another shroud
The danger near, Is seen to glide
And quickly lifts Adown the stairs—
A wakeful ear. O'er the grass-plot.
His eyes gleam bright This figure bears
With thoughts of beef Poker, red-hot.
Which he shall bite The fearful brand
From out that thief. Is quick applied
Where “Towzer” and
Soft on the wall The thief collide.
The thief has dropped ; There comes a yell
The heavy fall Of anguish fresh ;
Of rain has stopped. A nasty smell
The lightning’s flash Of burning flesh.
To him displays One mighty pull;
A window-sash The thief is freed 1
Easy to raise. Dog's mouth is full—
With gentle push A glorious feed.
It rises high;
When, lo ! a rush—
A fearful cry In pain, alone,
Heard miles at least! Sure-footed crept,
A growl of rage, On his way home,
And man and beast That thief adept.
A warfare wage. Good “ Towzer ” nods,
Good “Towzers’ ” teeth And dreams of beef,
A firm hold find, And prays the gods
Just underneath To send more thief.
KOHIMANA.
Somebody has been trading off artificial
Kings of Egypt, made out of donkey-skin, to
museums all over Europe, and there is a consider-
able row and riot in scientific circles as a con-
sequence. The process of making a King is very
simple. Take one old and hide-bound ass, and
wallop the animal to make his cuticle more pliable.
Then kill him, and sell his tail for ox-tail' soup.
Cut his skin into a sort of human shape and fit it
neatly on a lay-figure; then sew it together, and
stuff it with spice and ashes. Write some
hieroglyphics on the stomach setting forth that
this was the monarch who traded off corn at a
high figure during the dry spell in ancient Egypt,
and there you are. The King and donkey are so
wonderfully alike that no one can tell the differ-
ence.
Francisque Sarcey, in Scribner, for last
month, June, touches up Sara Bernhardt, and
here is how he tells the story. During a “Erou-
Frou ” rehearsal somebody said Sara was very
exacting ;
Sarah remained pensive, bub she smiled and said : “ It
is true, lam very exacting ! ” Then suddenly, becoming
serious; ■
“ Yes, it is all very fine ! But the end? Ah ! the end !
The thing is to end well! The climax should be dramatic
and stirring ! Suppose that Rochefort —whose death Ido
not wish, understand me—had been killed by a bullet at
the moment of his escape ! What an admirable death !
There is a climax ! A fine fifth apt! I should like to end
that way 1 Gambetta ended well'—-drama, mystery.
Come, tell me, how do you think I shall end?”
Nobody answered.
There were many pensies de derriere la tgte, to use
Sainte-Beuve’s expression, in the glances that were ex-
changed behind Sara, close to the side scene. Then a
very young comedian, almost a supernumerary, who
played in “ Frou Frou ” an insignificant role , that of a
domestic, shrugged his shoulders and answered his
directress— his directress !—with the thick and mocking
accent of the Paris street-boys.
‘‘You? How you will end, you? It isn’t hard to
guess ! You will end as a box-bperier!”
And do you think that Sara got angry with her pupil ?
Well, I should say so! She burst into laughter. She
found the answer so amusing. Box opener! . . . .
Gavroche, va ! She must have told the story herself.
She was always ready to laugh at everything. In her
dressing-room, the money which she received daily
evaporated like gold dissolved by aqua regia. There
went on, between the acts, on the nail, as it were, a daily
distribution of her salary by fractions, by hundreds and
twenties of francs. Her fifteen hundred francs would be
brought to her. Quick the pillage, the division, the
quarry! Poor woman: . . . “This for you, Madame,
G 1 A bouquet to be paid for. Good! . . .
Here ! take this, you ! Carry it to the hair-dresser ! Ah !
an instalment to X '. . . . So much to Z 1
. . . Good! . . . What else ? . . . T has
written this morning. I send him this, he’ll have to be
patient.” . . . And still laughing: “ What is left me
now ? Fifteen francs ! Bah ! with fifteen francs one need
not starve ! Rut get change for this five-franc piece, I
need it for the carriage 1”
And a similar scene was enacted almost nightly in
Sara’s dressing-room.

10 years.

Said Bishop Magee : “I once heard of an
ill-paid minister who went to his deacon to solicit
an increase of salary. “ Salary ! ’ said the deacon,
“ I thought you worked for souls ? ” “So I do,”
replied the poor man, “but I cannot eat souls;
and if I could, it would take a good many souls of
your size to make a dish ! ”
According to Geraldton (W.A.) Advo-
cate, 18 mechanics at a local plantation refused
to work, st<ting that they could not work on the
breakfast offered them. They complain that the
ration male was so poor that frequently the men
who were last in re ponding to the meal-call got
nothing, and had to rely on their mates’ good
nature. They got no bedding nor light, and no
soap to wash themselves, and were penned up in
quarters not fit for pigs.

The Lost Drink
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I had spent the night in the watch-house —
My head was the size of three—
So I went and asked the chemist
To fix up a drink for me;
And he brewed it from various bottles
With soda and plenty of ice,
With something that smelt like lemon,
And something that seemed like spice.
It fell on my parching palate
Like the dew on the sun-baked plain,
And my system began to flourish
Like the grass in the soft spring rain;
It wandered throughout my being,
Suffusing my soul with rest,
And I felt as I “ scoffed ” that liquid
That life had a new-found zest.
I have been on the razzle-dazzle
Full many a time since then,
But I never could get the chemist
1 To brew me that drink again.
He says he’s forgotten the notion —
’Twas only by chance it came—
He tried me with various liquids,
But oh ! they are not the same.
We have sought, but we sought it vainly,
That one lost drink divine ;
We have sampled his various bottles,
But somehow they don’t combine :
Yet I know when I cross the River
And stand on the Golden Shore
I shill meet with an angel-chemist
To brew me that drink once more.
B.
A “ Native Land Laws Commission ”
which has been travelling Maoriland, taking
evidence from Maori and Pakeha anent _ land
transactions has unearthed some lively stories of
old times and of other times not very remote.
One of them relates to the last Maori war. New
Zealand’s “only general,” and a K.C.M.G. at
that, was one day lying in his tent when he heard
a Maori outside having an altercation with the
sentry. “Oh, never mind, allyright,” said the
Maori “me leave ’em here to-night, (men-
tioning the General’s name) give me the utu in
morning,” and with that the flap of the tent was
lifted and 40 gory heads were rolled in on the
supposed sleeper. The Government gave £5 a
head and “no questions asked” in those days,
and this industrious native collector had by dint
of patience, frugality, and hard work accumulated
£2OO worth of stock. The General won’t listen
to this story now, and it is not to appear in his
forthcoming book, but when it was recently told
in his presence and he strongly repudiated it,
another eminent colonial officer slapped him on
the back and said “ that’s all right old boy, we
know all about it, but it’s nothing to be ashamed
of —why we gave £lO a head up our way ! ” So
they did, and some awkward mistakes the too
covetous collector made sometimes. Another
story unearthed by the Commissioners related to
“ Makutu.’ To “ Makutu ” anyone is to bewitch
them so that they die—what an Irishman would
call “ putting the comether on ’em.” It is a fixed
article of belief amongst'the Maories, and a man
or woman who believe he or she is “Makutued ” will
calmly sit down and die, and then after decently
“ waking ” the corpse at a “ tangi,” the relatives
go round and look for the witch, and having found
him or her, promptly knock them on the head as
a precaution against their practising Makutu on
anyone else. There have been countless instances
of this sort of thing, some of them within the
last few years and only the other day an old fellow
was tried for witchcraft with his life as the
stake. It was a convenient way of getting
obnoxious folk out of the road and is an interesting
survival of “ the good old times.” The “ Makutu ’
that we refer to didn’t happen well for the plain-
tiff’s counsel. It was during the height of the
“Pai Marire” when the tohungas taught their
followers that they were bullet-proof and that
they had only to utter certain incantations to
eternally blast the presumptuous pakeha. An
old fellow named McMillan—Finlay McMillan—
lived in a native district. He had expressed him-
self contemptuously of the Pai Marire, and in
return the Hauhaus promised to put the
“comether ” over him. One day he was walking
alone along a lonely beach when he suddenly came
upon a Pai Marire fishing party. He was un-
armed, and so close that escape was hopeless.
With the party was an old priestess of powerful
“ mana”and fixing a fine rolling eye on Finlay,
who cordially wished he was home with his ma,
she commenced to roll out an incantation that
was to paralyse him in one act. By this time
Finlay was surrounded by enthusiastic Hauhaus
who squatted on the sand and fingered their
tomahawks lovingly in preparation for giving
practical effect to the curse if it didn’t do its work
with the expected neatness and despatch. Finlay
was greatly troubled and felt something more
than dead long ere the priestess began to get blue
in the face with her exertions and long after the
pupils of her eyes had vanished into her head.
Suddenly an idea struck him. He began to
address the “ first curser ” in particular, and the
dupes in general in fluent Gaelic, the tongue of
his early youth. He hadn’t uttered more than a
sentence or two before the tohunga stopped, and
her followers began to look uneasy. They had
never heard anything like this before, and con-
cluded that it must be some newer and more
deadly form of “Makutu.” Finlay rattled his
words out twice as quick, and after another
moment’s hesitation the tohunga bolted for the
bush, with her party after her, and left the
relieved Hielander in possession of his life and
sundry tomahawks and fishing tackle. Another
little custom which the commission unearthed
was that of putting the names of children unborn

The Privy Council suggests that its name be
altered to the “Albert University.” The Bul-
letin thinks that, considering the high status so
long enjoyed by medical and other degrees of

kindly to this greasy proposal. “ London
University ” means something solid ; “ Albert
University ” carries with it gim-crack insignific-
ance.
Melbourne Standard reports: “There
is one good thing that may be said of a spider

this means exactly, but we reprint it on the off-

in it somewhere.
The Government majority in the House of
Commons is 74. In the first year of the Parlia-
ment it was 118. The change has come about
through a Gladstonian gain of 17 seats at bye-
e'ections and the return of delinquents to the
Liberal ranks.
Election excitement and bush whisky have

Hear it on the recent Eden election contest : —
“ Duty calls as in the death-ride at Balaclava.
Silence reigns a moment as if invoking super-
natural courage. Death is defeated, the enemy
confronted, and victory crowns heroic honour.
From such a retrospect there is nothing to be
wondered at that Messrs. Garvan and Clarke
scored a two to one victory against the anointed
Goliath of the Parkes’ Government, clad in all
the gorgeous panoply of Government patronage,
and a forty-mile railway like a rainbow, in his
hand.”

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces —
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of What appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
ana has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile, imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now aiflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over’ whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the. bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul- .
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-#
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public,

SWORN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugelmann, Esq,
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severo-
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. 1 agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At‘the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, anil
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
