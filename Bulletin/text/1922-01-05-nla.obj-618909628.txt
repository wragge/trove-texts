The Red Page
The Real Futurism
Not for the praise of lip or easy pen
Would I implore the gods to leave the light
A little longer on the fields of men,
A little longer to restrain the night
And hold back all that glamor of the eve
Wherein remains but memory and peace.
Not for one moment would I idly grieve
That their applause of empty hands should
cease,
If only I may follow where my will
Has made long paths before me all the day
And climb to the brown summit of that hill
One word to all the great beyond to say.
Other white mornings shall have song to
bring;
But none in all the years my song can sing.
N.S.W.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Narrative Faculty
There is one asset most popular novel-
ists have in common with the great masters
of fiction, and that is the narrative faculty.
It is not an indispensable asset, for some
fairly good novels show very few signs of
its presence. A character is caught in some
attitude, say kneeling at prayers or shooting
grouse, and by an exhaustive catalogue ot
ii|s thoughts and impressions, by throwing an
intense light on his mind and external sur-
roundings, a vivid representation is achieved.
The scene changes, and in the next chapter
the same method is employed on a different
character. It is legitimate enough, and very
often elective, but it can be used by men
who have hardly any narrative faculty at
all. They may have other literary gifts, a
precis (6 and lively imagination, insight,
humor, an individual style, bat the absence
of this faculty keeps their work from rising
to the highest plane.
On the other hand there is the great,
democratic crowd of writers who were denied
everything at birth except this gift ot the
good fairy. “It’s a gift/* the unsophisti-
cated say. So it is. It is the one gift they
recognise in the novelist, and they reward
it well enough. Some critics are bewildered
by the vogue of Charles Garvice and Nat
Gould, and can see no reason for it except
a debased popular taste. But it would be
foolish to argue that mere badness is a pass-
port to popularity. There are probably many
people writing in obscurity who _ arei worse
than Charles Garvice and Nat Gould, and
the fact that these two are singled out shows
that they have some distinguishing mark.
What, in truth, they possess, in common
with Scott and Balzac, is the narrative
faculty, a faculty that has delighted all sorts
and conditions of men since the beginning,
and they are borne into popular favor on a
flood of incidents and pictures.
But what is the essence of this gift that
meets with such rewards? Coldly analysed
it is the power to fuse events aud conversa-
tions in such a way that the smooth flow
of the story is not impeded. It is the power
to bridge gulfs of time and place so that the
reader is conscious of nothing but continu-
ity. An apprentice to fiction, weak in the
narrative faculty, finds that his main charac-
ter is left in a certain locality in a certain
month. The next event is to happen the
month after in a different place; but how
get him there without dwelling on the inter-
vening stages? He perhaps starts a different
chapter, but every incident and conversation
cannot have a chapter to itself, nor can rows
of asterisks, those signs of failure, be strewn
promiscuously. The born narrator hardly
seems conscious of these difficulties. In un-
interrupted flight he skims from crest to crest,
and is never left wallowing in the troughs.
The> pity is that the narrative faculty
should have been bestowed upon mankind so
indiscriminately, coming into the possession
of men whose lack of other literary qualities
precludes them from making the best use of
it. People want stories, so why should they
not have good ones? tVhy should their
taste be debased so that they surrender
easily to cheap illusions, and breathlessly
follow the adventures of marionettes with-
out character or humor? I have known men
on Western stations whose small hoard of
books included Balzac and Baroness Orczy,
and they read both writers with avidity,
hardly distinguishing between them. Their
primal need had been supplied. What they
wanted was a good story, and their imagina-
tions could be set working by anything that
had a continuous flow of events.
Can this faculty be acquired, though, by
the sweat of the brow t Literary history
seems to show that it can, in the same way
as an individual style, yet it can only be
retained with continual effort. Flaubert’s
midnight labors were not solely devoted to
finding the right word, but to producing
movement in events. There is evidence
that he was not a natural storyteller, the
internal evidence o_f some of his magnificent
failures. “Madame Bovary” moves easily
with all the vitality of organic life, but what
of “Salammbo”? For all his labored breath
it remains cold and statuesque, yet Flaubert
was a great writer, with an imaginative
energy that should have given life to many
masterpieces.
Then there is Geofge Moore, who has con-
fessed that he came to literature with few
gifts apart from a capacity for devoted ser-
vice. Perhaps this confession cannot be
taken too literally, but his published books
show with what pains he acquired the style
that, flows so easily nowadays. Look at
those of his middle period ! The words fall
into their places like good soldiers, discip-
lined but a trifle touched with rheumatics,
and without joy in the march. Later we
find them swinging along, lightly and buoy-
antly, to the sound of music. Nor is it
only a matter of prose-style, of a pleasing
sequence of words and ideas: there is that
fusion of events and impressions that shows
the narrative faculty moving on its highest
plane, and carrying everything along in its
current.
George Moore acquired his narrative
faculty: Conrad inherited his at birth ; but
what test can we put to those modern
writers who construct their novels from a
succession of .studies in still life, as Gals-
worthy does in “The Country House,” and
Arnold Bennett in “Clayhanger” ? There
is one form that demands all the literary
qualities in some degree, and that is the
short story. In particular it calls for a
high development of the narrative faculty,
for its essence is a unity of impression that
cannot be achieved by a succession of sil-
houettes. When these writers come to short
stories we see the weakness of their narra-
tive powers. The lack of good short stories in
English shows that the narrative faculty has
not been cultivated to the same degree as
other literary qualities, and perhaps it has
even been despised. Literary art has moved
too far from the bazaar and the market-
place, and the only people left telling stories
to the crowd are the charlatans. If is a
relief to remember that Henry Lawson is
still our most popular writer in Australia.
VANCE PALMER.
The Witch-doctors
To my mind the greatest hoax ever per-
petrated on the literary world was Walt
Whitman. According to Robert Browning,
the man who would impress the multitude
must “never put off the prophet.” lie must
have his “right-arm’s rod-sweep, tongue’s
imperial fiat.” He must shout his message
from the mountain-top. If he goes down
amongst the multitude he becomes one of
the multitude. If he talks their talk they
understand him too easily and take him as
a matter of course. He becomes one of
themselves. So at times"comes along a man
who goes up on to the mountain-top and
shouts out with great lung-power and confi-
dence and enthusiasm, and with a profound
air of mysterious knowingness, what the
multitude will certainly not understand.
Neither will any man who is not of the mul-
titude understand, for it is extremely doubt-
ful if there is anything in the man’s shout-
ing to be understood. Witeh-doctory is just
as much alive to-day in the literary com-
munity as it ever was amongst the wildest
African tribes. This loud-voiced man is the
witch-doctor. The multitude hearing him
says, “This man speaks so loudly and so
confidently, there must be some deep mean-
ing in what he says. We evidently are not
clever enough to understand him.” And
the man is accepted as a prophet. This is
a chance for the academics, the Culture-
leaders. They say in effect, “Yes, there is
much here. You cannot be expected to un-
derstand this man. He is too profound for
you. You cannot go to him with a vast
store of learning as we can. We understand
him.” Then the people say, “What clever
men these are who can understand what is
hidden from us !”—which is precisely what
the “clever men” would have them say.
These Culture-leaders are the witch-doctor’s
high priests. They give him praise at the
expense of more easily understood people.
So Tagore, the Indian mystic, is granted the
Nobel Prize for Literature, and Walt Whit-
man is classed as a poet and thinker above
his fellow-counti'yman and real man of
genius, Ralph Waldo Emerson.
I have been asking reading people their
opinion of Walt Whitman. About nine out
of every ten say that he is undoubtedly a
great writer, but that the only poem of
his they really know well is his “O Captain,
My Captain!” In my opinion this poem is
a very poor one, and I feel sure that if it
were unknown and submitted anonymously
it would be rejected by practically every
magazine editor to whom it was submitted.
In trying to get at what Walt Whitman
means, it seems to me that men labor and
stumble, like tired cows in a boggy field,
through all the rhapsodical jumble of non-
sense that passes as high wisdom, and, com-
ing suddenly upon a rhymed verse with a
little obvious meaning, welcome it. They
find it beautiful, as the Arab finds the few
stunted palms and shrubs that make up the
oasis in the middle of the desert beautiful.
Its value is placed upon it by the? waste
that is all around it. Another writer like
Walt Whitman —a sort of Chinese herbalist
amongst writers —is Tagore. In the works
of these men the Culture-leaders, who are
experts at self-deceit, say they see meaning,
and the people reading the writings of the
Culture-leaders believe that there must be
meaning. And they keep looking until they
see what they set out to see, as others of
their kind see marvellous things in crystal
balls. Like the Cubists and the Futurists
and leaders of other fantastic art cults, these
writers gather a sort of self-hypnotised fol-
lowing, and they become great to that follow-
ing. But the truly great men of literature
are all greatly sane and clear in all their
works. There is not a trace of any furred
and feathered witch-doctory about them.
That is the peculiarity of writers like Emer-
son and Shakspeare. It is a peculiarity of
one whom the Culture-leaders would never
dare to class with Walt Whitman —Rudyard
Kipling.
A friend once told me that a follower of
Bernard Shaw was quoting Bernard Shaw
and Tolstoy to him to show him how Shak-
speare’s reputation was built on false pre-
mises. The man told my friend that he
should examine Shakspeare apart from any
preconceived ideas and prejudices and see
if this were not correct. My friend went
home, took up his Shakspeare and opened
it haphazard. The page happened to be
the opening one of “Twelfth Night,” and
at once he came on the lines beginning, “If
music be the food of love, play on.” It
was enough for him. I apply the same test
to Walt Whitman and open the book at this:
“I am the acme of things accomplished, and
I am encloser of things to be!” If this
sort of thing is great poetry, then it seems
to me that some of our Lord Mayors and
their fellow-politicians should stand high in.

In the selection of Anthony Horderns’ large, new
assortments more thought and care were exercised
to meet the taste and practical requirements of men
than most shops think worth while. The Quality
and Value offered have convinced the man who
formerly paid “fancy” prices that it is no longer
necessary to be extravagant in order to dress in
correct style, and demonstrated to the man who
formerly had to be satisfied with the commonplace
type of clothes that there is no need to pay an
additional tariff in order to dress well.

PINKETTES
FOR YOUR LIVER
Pinkettes, the new laxative,
give excellent results in cases of bil-
iousness and torpid liver. People
who are unnaturally drowsy and
sleepy, who lack ambition and
energy, are usually victims of their
liver.
Pinkettes have a specific action
on the liver and speedily banish the
feeling of lassitude and weariness.
They are effective without being
drastic and they have none of the
bad effects of strong purgatives.
Pinkettes also regulate the stomach
and liver, correct bad breath, clear
the complexion, and are an ex-
cellent remedy to use during colds
and fevers.

A Prayer.
If the great gods asked but one prayer from
me,
Poured out with the fervor and force of
my soul,
Oh, what would the burden of my pleading
be?
This: “Give me, ye gods, not a part, but
the whole
Of the exquisite joys and the passionate pain
Of my being to scatter in singing, like rain.
“Let me be strung as a tremulous wire
That murmurs of music to every wind ;
Torture my soul out in sweetness and fire,
And crush out the wine of the grapes of
my mind.
Yea, even my hunger, O gods, let me knead
Into bread that the lips of the strongest may
. feed.
“Keep me from prattle of pale, pretty things,
Tinkling a harp in the roses and dew ;
I would, great gods, fan my flame with your
wings
And laugh as the anguish incessantly grew,
Till the pain of my soul wrought in terrible
songs
The tale of men’s burdens and splendors and
wrongs.”

Moon-Mockery.
As a child romping in forgotten hours
With a dear comrade, once upon a time
I played with Day and heard her bluebells
chime,
“The Spring! The Spring is raining blossom-
showers !”
We piped a careless song among the flowers.
Ah! That was long ago in morning’s
prime.
Now : all the syllables of this new rhyme
Toll but a pitying knell for those past hours.
High in the sapphire sky I see the moon.
Splendidly still she pauses for a space
And takes the forest tops with storm of
light.
“O God !” I cry; “how can she rise so soon,
And on Day’s new-made grave in this
same place
Greet with such insolence disdainful
Night?’’

When Brahma Dreams.
Have you visioned a sea-stream darker than
sapphires or midnight skies,
Where beautiful cliffs red-golden from the
floor of the waters rise,
Like the walls of the fair Valhalla or the
ramparts of Paradise?
A westering fight englamors the shafts of
the forest\yith gold,
And the horns of . the moon to the eastward,
faint and sinter and cold,
In a saffron mist are withholden like veiled
Isis of old.
All flowers that are haloed with legend, hya-
cinth, asphodel,
And Daphne, the fugitive maiden, trans-
formed by a swift white spell—
All flowers that are fair and immortal on
the thornless hillsides dwell.
Would you walk in the dew with Helen,
whose face was a flame to Troy,
Or look on young Alexander, or on David,
the shepherd boy,
Or hear, at the feet of Homer, the musics
that never cloy?
Aloof in the cool white raiment they pass
with their deathless bays,
All those whose names are a beacon to
.lighten the years and days,
And Beauty goes ivory-sandalled through the
golden forest ways.
Here is the rose of desire in the midst of
the lilies of peace:
Here are no fetters or burdens, for this is
the place of release;
Here, in the heart of all dreaming, the
dreams of the ages cease.
Do the sirens rise from the sea-stream, seal-
eyed and with uearl-pure breasts?
Ah, surely the gulfs reveal them, for this is
the end of all quests!
And the pale, web-footed sea-horses, sleek-
sided, with silver crests.
Here the leaves have murmurous voices, in-
numerable, tender and low,
Andi on visible, shadowy pinions the winds
o’er the lilies go,
And malachite,' marble and jasper as with
soft life-pulses glow.
Plere Life, like a flame, burns naked, and
Truth has uncovered her face;
Lost lovers for centuries parted keep tryst
in this griefless place,
And the hounds of Artemis follow through
myrtles a bloodless chase.
Are the dreams of the ages folly, a shadow
of fire on clay,
Man-shaped for a moment, an aeon, to hun-
ger , and thirst and pray?
Or is it 1 a dream of Brahma that whitens the
world with may?

THE MESSAGE OF 1922.
The world faces the New Year with at. least
such a measure of hope as it never knew
before in history. It has been denied dis-
armament ; but armaments will be limited
sufficiently to avert wholesale and immedi-
ate bankruptcy. It is possible —in fact,
human nature being what it is, extremely
probable—that some of the nations merely
regard limitation of armaments as an
arrangement similar to the recuperative rest
which boxers are allowed between rounds
under the Queensberry Rules. But the ideal-
ist nations, and the nations like Britain and
the U.S.A. which are in the agreeable
dilemma of the ancient imperialist who found
himself with no more worlds to conquer, may
reasonably hope that once civilisation gets
a taste of small navies it will like the dish
well enough to demand small armies also,
and that finally it will go in for the full
Biblical ration of peace and goodwill
toward men. Meantime, however, it is dis-
couraging to note that in that other form of
warfare, the “veiled warfare” of trade, the
nations are more truculent than ever. The
capital ships may be going down, but the
tariffs are going up; and, after all, a well-
aimed duty can kill as many people as any
15-inch gun, and it is capable of doing more
damage to the enemy’s overseas commerce
than a dozen submarines. Since the Armis-
tice the Empire’s friends, France and Japan,
have largely increased their tariffs. . The
U.S.A.’s new Republican administration is
on the point of doing the same, though its
exporters and bond-holders, who can only
take their dues in imports, point wildly to
the already enormous dimensions of the
duties on most articles. Minor European
countries —Switzerland, Spain, Jugo-Slavia,
Roumania, Lat\ r ia —have built up formid-
able tariff walls; and most of the South
American States ■"nd all the more important
Dominions—including, of course, Australia
-—are following the same fiscal line. Britain
recently passed an anti-dumping
measure, and London Times has on several
occasions of late its foreign readers
that the United Kingdom is not likely to re-
main outside the Protectionist pale for much
longer.
► *
In pre-war days a country Avith a high
wage- and living-standard—as Australia, for
example had merely to raise its tariffs
when it wanted to improve the lot of the
industrialists. _ The principle was to be seen
“Of* clearly m the Deakin Government’s
ill-fated Excise Tariff Act. What did the
opinion of the benighted foreigner matter?
It he was an Asiatic we wanted nothing
ti om him, and feared nothing, his products
being notoriously worthless ow’ing to his
lack of technical skill. If he was a Euro-
pean, then (1) his wage and living stand-
ard would not be vastly lower than our oivn;
and (2) there were many of our products
which he simply had to take even if he was
required to pay for them in gold instead
°. } n goods. Compare that halcyon period
wl th the present, go far as Asia is con-
cerned the war-years transformed much of
F—including practically the whole of Japan
" into a hive of up-to-date industry. The
yellow people made their little mistakes—
they sent out matches which refused to
strike or blew up, and toys which fell to
pieces at a touch—but they are making
amends for these indiscretions; and before
long they expect their manufacturers to have
as good a name as those of any white race.
And most of their operatives remain satis-
fied with the equivalent of about £1 for a
60-liour week. On the European continent
two. passions are dominant: nationalism and
(arising from it) a determination to sur-
vive economically at any price in the way
of hard work and self-denial. It is the new
war. Germany’s Wiederaufbau, or organ-
isation of ex-soldiers determined to do for
their native land in industry what they
failed to accomplish by war, is not confined
to. the Fatherland. Even half-starved Aus-
tria has started a patriotic movement on
the same lines ; and the furiously national-
ist Balkan States are not behindhand in
the matter, while the neutral nations which
did so well out of the Avar have to enter
into the general competition or lose their
gains. As in Avar, no mercy is shown, and
it is the w’ea.k positions which are pounded
hardest. This cable message is significant
of what is going on everywhere:—
German dyemakers have advanced the prices
of dyes for silkpiece goods by 300 per cent., being
twelve times the pre-war price, Avith the intention
of ousting British cSyemakers , from the world’s
markets by the prohibitive price of dyes not obtain-
able in Great Britain.
Germany is in a position to take up attitudes
like this after losing the whole of its
colonies, an incalculable quantity of iron and
coal and the population attached thereto, and
huge sums in cash reparations, because up to
the present the nation has been solid. Like
Belgium, it has “got back to work again.”
There is little or no industrial unrest; and
yet, according to the special correspondent
of the London Empire Review (8/12/’2.1),
German workers go short of the necessaries of
life. A meat meal daily becomes impossible, clothes
have to be worn long after they have become almost
useless for warmth, and families herd together in
unhealthily cramped quarters.
* * * *
What it all means is that, disarmament
or no disarmament, luxury countries like
Australia are up against a much bigger
problem than the one that faced them at the
end of 191.4. Almost any man can go into
battle, even aie for his country: it takes a
much bigger character to stint himself for
his country, to toil for it in some unpic-
turesque civil avocation, and to keep his
head and his temper for it. In one sense
the ball is at the Commonwealth’s feet. It
has the chance to become as economically
and nationally safe as the U.S.A. That is
to say, it has the coal and iron in conjunc-
tion which made Britain the richest country
in the world at the beginning of last century,
and w r as threatening to put Germany in that
position when the world-war came. In 1863
a French Commission on Technical Education
used these words in its report, little think-
ing, probably, of their bearing on France’s
national life :—•
It is certain that henceforth the most powerful
nation will be not that which possesses the most
extensive territory but that which is the
most industrious, the most skilful, the best educated,
the most capable of utilising all the means and
forces which science can place at man’s disposal,
and which enable him to triumph over matter.
Australia has the opportunity, in the com-
mercial war which is now on, to go as far
as Germany did between the time those
words were printed and the end of the cen-
tury. But it will not do it in the same time
without getting workers; it will not get
workers in any numbers without industries;
and it will not get industries on the grand
scale till it gets something approximating to
the friendly co-operation between worker
and employer which exists amongst the pro-
letariat nations which are our rivals. And
the difference between our position now and
that of the United Kingdom in the twenties
and Germany in the sixties of last century is
that time is the essence of the contract. If
we are unable to compose our industrial dif-
ferences within a reasonable period and get
down to steady toil and an eager assimila-
tion of knowledge and skill, the right to do
so is likely to pass from us for ever.
THREATENED TOWNS AND
INDUSTRIES.
Nineteen-twenty-tavo is either a new year
or an old year come round again and doing
a second trip. It all depends on whether
Time is a circle or ellipse or some such
shape, or the one and only straight line in
the Universe. Even if Time moves in a circle
1922 may not be a copy, repetition or imita-
tion of something that went before; the circle
may be so vast that the first or Creation
year hasn’t got round yet. But if Time
isn’t a sort of merry-go-round the inference
is that it will keep running on a straight
road till one of two events happens : either
the last vehicle will go by, after which man
may remain but will have to do without
Time, all moments being the same moment,
which will be practically the equivalent to
living in a world where there is no weather;
or the engine far, far ahead that drags the
great train of chronology may strike some-
thing too hard for it, and then all the Past
—the used-up years—will reel together with
a jolt, and all the Future —the unused years
—will pile on top of itself in one blue burial
blent. Wherever such speculations may
lead, however, the fact remains that 1922 is
a different year, and unless we do many
things we haven’t done hitherto and leave
undone many things that we have done, the
signs point to the difference being for the
worse. For example, the Ma State’s third-
best town, Broken Hill, was last year ob-
literated, for all present purposes, when the
Dooley-MoGikr Cabinet decided to keep
work suspended by grants of public money ;
and this year it is quite possible to go a step
further and practically obliterate the second-
best town.
It is the habit to regard Newcastle as a
place that lives nrosperously on coal-digging.
As a matter of fact it has finished or almost
finished that part of its career through the
exhaustion of the local deposits. The fact
is a whole essay on the folly of regarding
mining—-the using-up of irreplaceable capital
—as an industry at all, at least in the same
sense as manufacturing, which can go on
for ever. Newcastle is now a shipping port
for Maitland coal, and will probably keep
that trade till the new field is exhausted in
turn, or till high-wage and short-hour and
no-hour movements end the export trade, and
the import of coal from England, now com-
menced, takes its place. The town finished
another part of its career long ago. For over
30 years it was a railway terminus —was
one until the completion of the Hawkesbury
bridge turned it into a wayside station. In
those days it naturally had a business in
wool and wheat, but when the railway was
extended to Sydney a judicious adjustment
of railway charges shifted that sort of thing
to Octopusville. When it seemed satisfac-
torily disposed of, by the removal to Sydney
of everything, in fact, except the coal trade,
which was too heavy to lift, Private Enter-
prise chanced along in the shape of a com-
pany, mostly owned in England and managed
here by a Dutchman. Not being bound by
the One Big City instinct the Broken Hill
Proprietary Co. established- works which
gave direct employment to about 6000 men
and indirect employment to perhaps 9000
more. They became, in fact, the life of New-
castle. But in one of its lighter moments
the Labor Ministry took a hand. It turned
a Sydney political lawyer with no special
business knowledge into a wage-raising and
houFshortening Judge so that it might live
up to its reputation as a great work-stopping
and holiday-making Government. Its own
toil is light, for even its legal department is
shared among three highly-paid Cabineteers,
and its pay goes on whether it toils or not,
a.nd it desired to share these blessings with
its supporters at somebody else’s cost. So it
came about that the big works were ordered
to gladden the hearts of all concerned by
paying the same old wage for one-twelfth
less work—not out of loan money as the
Government does, but out of its own money.
The purpose was that the employees should
have more leisure to admire the beauties of
Newcastle and to spend money at the races,
or to enjoy that stillness which some regard
as complete happiness. But as many
branches of the industry can’t pay one-
twelfth more than the old rates because the
money isn’t there (the Court simply took
the money for granted 1, 70 per cent, of the
business is closing indefinitely. Parliament
is not sitting, and the Dooley Ministry is in
hiding lest a meeting with the Legislature
should cost it its job ; therefore little can be
done —-unless the workpeoule take a dislike
to the prospect of idleness and starvation
and decide to be more sensible than either
Ministers or their tame Judges.
Some time ago the N. S. Wales Premier
called a conference of employers and em-
ployees (“round-table,” of course-—no other
sort is used now), to decide how to make
industry boom like the green bay-tree in a
heavily-falling market without reducing
wages or increasing hours to something like
the pre-war standard, or adopting piece-
work or some other antidote to slow-going.
He expressed himself righteously disap-
pointed at the conference’s failure to solve
the question which he draws £2445 per
annum for solving himself. In this con-
nection the news that dribbles in persis-
tently from Russia is full of interest. There
Lenin, lately the exemplar of all good
Dooleys, is reported to have just got his
tame Soviet together and told it that he
repudiates all the bloodstained pappycock
by which he rose to power, but retains
power just the same. Communism, for the
sake of which he and his friends filled
Russia with murder, torture, blood, famine
and ruins, he says has proved of no account.
Having educated himself at the charge of
the country, he orders a return, if it isn’t
too late, to plain work and plain ordinari-
ness. Dooley probably wishes he could do
the same thing; but the cases are not the
same— Lenin simplified matters by hanging or
shooting anybody who looked like George
Fuller might look if he were in Russia, so
now he can grab the local George Fuller
policy without the local G. Fuller making
any fuss or trouble. In these circumstances,
things being so different. Dooley has to at
any rate pretend to stick to his own policy ;
which means that little relief can be ex-
pected from Dooley. If the men of New-
castle and places like Newcastle want to be
saved their only hope seems to lie in saving
themselves. And the same thing applies to
the men of every threatened industry.
SELLING SOULS FOR VOTES.
William Ferguson Massey, the man from
Limavaddy, who has ruled Maoriland since
1912, doesn’t subscribe to the doctrine that
a country can be made prosperous by heap-
ing crushing burdens on industry. That it
can is the belief of Dooley and Lang in
N. S. Wales, and of Theodore and Fiiielly
in Queensland, w r here slump and unemploy-
ment reign and the word “economy” has
been expunged from the dictionary. During
the war Massey found it necessary to levy
high taxes to pay interest and sinking fund
on the mounting debt and build up a surplus
against the lean years that were surely coming
(his surplus in 1920-21 amounted to six
millions, whereas Dooley, with a much
bigger revenue relatively and absolutely, had
a deficit of nearly half-a-million), but he has
never shown any liking for the expedient,
justifying it only as the lesser of two evils.
His ideas on the subject were expounded in
the M.L. Parliament on December 15:—
Last session I made a promise that one of my
first duties would be to reduce taxation, particularly
land- and income-tax. Nobody will be better pleased
than myself w'hen I can see taxation down generally
to the amount collected prior to the war. I am
not taking the risk of a 10 per cent, rebate on
income-tax, but I think that 5 per cent, will be
encouragement to people who contribute to the
country’s revenue. I believe that the present high
taxation is doing M.L. an immense amount of
damage. The taxation of this country is more
than it can carry comfortably. There is no question
about it.
That is the verdict of a man who is well
qualified to judge the effects of both light and
heavy taxes, Having imposed the former
from 1912 to 1915 and the latter from 1915
to 1922. Yet, compared with the double
dose administered in Australia, the M.L.
income-tax is by no means drastic. It starts
at Is. 3d. in the f, the same as in N. S.
Wales, which has no war bill to meet, and
finishes at Bs. 9d., as against 10s. 7d. in
the Ma State and the Commonwealth. There
is a general exemption of £3O0 —higher than
any on this over-goverhed continent—to-
gether with sundry allowances. And hence-
forward people who pay up promptly will
have 5 per cent, deducted from their in-
come-tax and 10 per cent, knocked off their
land-tax, while those who weigh in extra-
early are to receive the Savings Bank rate
of interest on their money until the due
date. Australians, who are promised no
such concessions and have no possibility
of getting any, may well envy the sagacity
w ; th which the M.L. finances have been
administered.
* * * *
It is depressing to turn in this connection
from Massey to Dooley. Last year the
Dooley Government doubled the super-tax,
which had stood at 3d. in the £, and put
from Id. to lOd. on to the ordinary tax,
the reason given being that it wanted to
“wipe out the deficit.” Two millions of
fresh revenue was raised by these exactions,
hut the deficit refused to be wiped out;
the only result of the year’s operations was
another deficit. Lang, the Treasurer, there-
upon proposed to bleed the taxpayers of a
further two millions, not to extinguish the
debit balance he had inherited or the one
he had manufactured, but to provide against
the third, which, as the natural consequence
of his muzzy methods of finance, is on the
way. Before he had given particulars of
his new scheme of extortion his Govern-
ment resigned, and when it came back, after
Fuller had failed to get a dissolution, it
had to be content with reimposing the 1920
rates in order to scramble into recess. This
notwithstanding, that non-Labor electors
who are now sending in their income-tax
papers will pay on the higher scale if
Dooley and Lang triumph in the constitu-
encies appears from the following-
“lf successful at the elections, the State Govern-
ment will wipe out the deficit of £2,000,000 by
increasing, on a graduated scale, the tax on ail
incomes over £l5 a week.’’ On Wednesday Mr.
Dooley made this announcement. He further said
that under the Government proposals the man who
was receiving £lO a week would pay less tax than
at present, and the man on the £l5-a-week mark
would not be called upon to pay more. “We in-
tend,’’ added Mr. Dooley, “to put through the Bill,
readjusting the income tax in May, if possible.”
The Government intends, in short, to make
the income-tax an election issue. With its
characteristic knack of soiling everything
it touches, it has degraded its principal
taxing measure, which should be indepen-
dent of class and party, to a means of favor-
ing its supporters and those who may be in-
duced to become supporters, and of penalis-
ing- its opponents. In the ranks of those
marked down for punishment are farmers,
whose wheat is selling at pre-war rates;
fruit-growers and market-gardeners, whose
produce is a drug in the market; cow-
cockies, faced with the closing of condensed-
milk factories and a horrible slump in the
price of butter ; graziers, who hadn’t recov-
ered from the drought when the bottom fell
out of the wool and dead-meat markets; all
the metal-mining companies, some of which
are just beginning to operate again after years'
of idleness; and the general body of manu-
facturers, who have been knocked endways
by foreign competition, the slow-down sys-
tem and artificially inflated rates of wages.
To add to the burdens of the producing in-
dustries at a time when, for lack of means
to employ them, thousands of men are being
thrown out of work is an act of utter mad-
ness. While Dooley is raising taxation
Massey is lowering it; but, then, Massey
has some regard for industry. The only
concern of Dooley and his colleagues is
with votes.
THE MAN WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN
AN ACTOR.
The press of Australia has one lamentable
defect; there is a feature in which it falls
so far short of perfection that the fulsome
praise of visitors like Lord Northcliffe
counts for little in the minds of men capable
of making an impartial survey. William
Morris Hughes knows what it is. Once a
month he gives pathetic utterance to his
knowledge. His last outburst occurred
only a few days ago. It was eloquent and
impassioned, and cast so lurid a light on
the soul of a great small man that it is
printed with glee by all against whom its
attack was directed :
Parliament is a wonderful place ; it is made up
of wonderful men. But wonderful as they are
they become mere atomies when compared with
their critics outside. In the medical profession it
is not usual to regard experience and ability as
a handicap. In the law, too, the people suffer
from a similar delusion. But in the public life
it is the prerogative of every person, and especially
those who gain a livelihood by writing for the public
press, to point the broad and unmistakable way which
should be followed, and indicate the faults and in-
consistencies of public men.... I have taken to read-
ing the press with a view to finding out if there
is one good word the press can say of me. I have
discovered n0ne....1n all these years I have never
had a journal say a good word of me.
This, of course, is merely an echo of pre-
vious cries of anguish. When Mr. Hughes
is not standing with uplifted right hand
appealing to Heaven to bear witness that
he does not give a damn for the press, he
is seeking to lacerate the bosoms of his audi-
ence with dolorous complaints. Here is the
peculiar defect of the Australian press: it
lacks the psychology that would make the
inner merits of Mr. Hughes visible as a
blazing range by night; it is wanting in


the intuition that would render his hourly
efforts to hide his candle under a bushel
as vain as he wishes them to be; it has no-
thing of the fine liberality of soul that gives
a great man credit for "his greatness, even
when his words and deeds have failed to
impress it upon beholders.
But the charge is true only in a degree.
In the time the Prime Minister mentions
we have read much praise of him in many
papers. There exist minor publications so
devoted to his cause, so enamored of his
person, that he is invested by them with a
sort of political infallibility, and full-page
portraits of the Prime Minister have orna-
mented their issues week after week, surely
a manifest devotion for which they are de-
serving of some little thanks, some exemption
from the anathemas Mr. Hughes breathes
ever against the press as a whole. Again
and again the greater dailies have fought
his cause for him—even The Bulletin did
so at the greatest crisis of his political life
—and if in the course of their fulminations
against his political enemies they found
little space to dwell upon his amiability,
his courtesy, his unselfish patriotism, his
exact statesmanship, and, above all, his
modesty, he might at least be generous
enough to admit the possibility that long
recitations of his merits were crowded
out by thundering animadversions on the
treachery, duplicity, cunning, knavery and
treasonable and despicable demerits
of his opponents. At least they left Mr.
Hughes resplendent in a kind of reflected
glory and gave him the benefit of a dark
background, against which he shone out as
the pure white flower of political chivalry.
Mr. Hughes shows that he has no mind
for nuances when he fails to credit the great
dailies with the inferences with the aid of
which he has been able to figure for so long
as our only Possibility, the one Desirable
in whose absence the land might be given
over to those wolves in sheep’s clothing
which tli(> Labor party nourishes, or the
lambs in lion skins which are the product
of latter-day Conservatism. They have not
cried the praises of W. M. Hughes from the
office-tops, but they have screamed dispraise
and abuse of those who are the antagonists
of W. M. Hughes, and to complain that
such upholders are lacking in the amenities
is to exclaim against the man who saves
you from drowning because he does not
sufficiently praise your swimming.
Furthermore, in using the unfortunate
simile of the doctor and the lawyer, our states-
man makes it evident how defective is his
logic, a possession, among many others, for
which he demands the appreciation of press
and pulpit. A doctor is only accepted as a
doctor, and empowered to act as such, after
a long, exact course of education and severe
training. A lawyer, too, is given credit for
his knowledge of the law after he has given
proof of it under severe trial and to the
satisfaction of experts. In short, the doctor
and the lawyer are welj instructed special-
ists who have been called upon to demon-
strate the fact beyond chance of evasion,
whereas the politician is a person chosen
almost haphazard for an important task,
for the accomplishment of which he may
have no special attributes, and of the know-
ledge of which he may be, and, in fact,
often is, wholly ignorant. The public atti-
tude towards the politician is more its atti-
tude towards the quack than towards the
doctor, and the position is not unreason-
able until the politician indubitably makes
good.
An important point Mr. Hughes’s fre-
quent rebuke makes plain: he has mistaken
his calling. In the past he tried his hand
at many things, and once for a brief season
he was on the right path. But he forsook
the stage for the public platform, and ever
since he has experienced the penalties, and
has uttered loud complaints against them
without giving the smallest evidence of per-
ceiving that he alone is to blame. He should
have remained an actor. On the Dublic plat-
form there is no amelioration of the fierce
white light. But the stage softens and sub-
dues blemishes of mind and body. It gives
the performer exactly the light in which he
is to be seen to the best advantage; it
paints him a smile if the smile be wanting;
it endows him with a dimple that was actually
a wrinkle ; it steeps him in the rose-hue of
fancy. More, Melpomene, muse of tragedy,
assures her votary the full-throated chorus
of praise that Mr. Hughes so ardently
craves. Even if he were not supreme in art
he could look confidently for the high en-
comiums that fall in a perpetual shower
on the just and the unjust alike in the
modern theatre. Sitting in the dress-circle
watching the hero at his task, plentifully
larded with grease-paint, amply padded and
prinked and curled to perfection, and hear-
ing the loud applause of the people, seeing
the frenzied clapping of hands and knowing
that Monday morning’s papers will bristle
with laudation, Mr. Hughes must realise,
almost with tears, the mistake he made when
he forsook the boards and turned, his back
on George Rignolo’s company for the poor,
plain company it is his fortune now to keep.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Railway-building as the Last Refuge of
Scoundrels.
As most things are duplicated in Australia
(income-tax, land-tax, electoral rolls, sta-
tistics. agenis-general, governors, arbitra-
tion courts, savings banks, etc.) it was in
the natural order of things that the Amal-
gamated Engineers should get two awards—
one State and the other Federal. And as an
engineer, however amalgamated, is only
human, they naturally reached for the big-
ger one —the Federal. It will add another
heavy load to the railway expenses and
make a big addition to the deficit, which is
already so staggering that the taxpayer is
tempted to regret that the curse of logn
railways built by the State was invented.
No one can say that the wage' awarded is
too high, but it is a gfeat deal higher than
many of the lines can pay, they being mere
corrupt jobs built as an excuse for loan
expenditure and to cover somebody’s igno-
ranee of how to keep productive and self-
supporting industry alive. Railways, in Aus-
tralia, have become the last refuge of scoun-
drels, as patriotism is in other countries.
The N. S. Wales management is frankly of
opinion that any attempt to extract more
revenue by further increase of charges
would only reduce revenue by destroy-
ing traffic, the breaking point of a
much-taxed people having been about
reached. So an obvious course is to
close a number of the lmpeless routes in dis-
tricts which were supposed to be “devel-
oped,” but which, after the vaunted “repro-
ductive works” have swallowed the public
wealth for a generation, have only been de-
populated. Closure is common enough with
Private Enterprise when a railway pays
neither dividend nor exoenses, but in an in-
sane desire to save the State’s face it hasn’t
yet been resorted to much if at all in Aus-
tralia. For a Ministry with only one idea
in its so-called mind- —that of more and
worse railways as an excuse for more loans
and jobs—the acknowledgement that it is
time to take the back track would be fatal.
There are a few short routes waiting con-
struction in the Ma State, such as those from
Narrabri to Goff’s Harbor, Goulburn to Jer-
vis Bay and Bombala to Twofold Bay, inas-
much as they would save time, labor and
distance, and give rise to new cities. But
there is a vastly greater mileage which it
would be a saving to close and possibly dis-
mantle unless it could be sola to an insane
billionaire. When more than half N.S.W.
—from just beyond Coonabarabran to the
S. Australian border and from Queensland
down to Victoria, including the State’s great-
est raetal-minii)" field and the whole course
of its greatest river—has sunk into such
emptiness that it is over-represented with
one Federal member out of a total of 28, it
is time to realise that the old methods have
failed. If effort was concentrated for the
next 20 or 30 years on establishing a fairly
dense population evenly along the coast and
a certain distance inland — evenly, not in a
thick blob round Port Jackson and on a strag-
gling line inland from Port Jackson—includ-
ing the people we have, and as many as can
arrange to be born and as many desirable as
can be imported, a huge saving would be
made possible. A moderately condensed
people can be governed, preached to, taught,
policed, railwayed, roaded, tried, convicted,
gaoled and hanged at almost nothing per
head as compared with one which is spilt
over vast areas at the rate in places of one
to 10 square miles. And if the coastal popu-
lation happened to break up into smaller
governing areas so much the better.
The Whipping-boy in Politics.
In the Dark Ages families of importance
had a whipping-boy who paid vicariously
for the lapses of the junior members. In
our enlightened period the Commission or
Government Department is expected to
fulfil a similar service for Ministers; and
when the. system is challenged the annoy-
ance of persons in authority is boundless.
Thus T. R. Ashworth, in the course of his
struggle to get a public inquiry into the
administration of the War Service Homes
Department, made these reasonable, even
admirable, admissions before the Public
Accounts Committee: —
The only individuals I am after are the official
and political chiefs who should be h§ld responsible
for bad administration. ... It is the politician I am
after, the man who should shoulder the responsibility
for bad. administration.
Senator Millen actually quoted this, dur-
ing the debate on the Appropriation Bill, in
proof of the dangerous malignity of Ash-
worth. “I have been for 25 years in public
life,” he complained. “When Mr. Ash-
worth can show such evidence of the con-
tinued confidence of his constituents in his
character and his conduct of public affairs,
he will be entitled to speak in a way which
he has not the right to do to-day.” With
equal relevancy a llqhenstaueen or a
Sfcrza might have pointed to the fact that
his family had always owned a whipping-
boy as a reason why the sense and justice
of the arrangement should never be chal-
lenged. In point of fact, the public is
getting thoroughly distrustful of the wide-
spread delegation of responsibility to irre-
sponsibles which has become the rule under
the Hughes regime. The system, well
exemplified in the Department which Senator
Millen controls, is for persons to be ap-
pointed at salaries which are generous rela-
tively to their ability and told to do the
Minister’s work for him. They are not given
a free hand, or anything like it. Colonel
Walker, when he had charge of the War
Service Homes Department, was not con-
sulted as to the advisability of the Com-
monwealth Bank being brought into com-
petition with him as a home-builder. The
Repatriation Commission was given instruc-
tions to be generous to the Diggers before
a large section of the public began to forget
their services; when the inevitable ingrates
began to make their influence felt, the Com-
mission “got the office” to retrench, and
retrench hard. Colonel Walker made a
mess of the War Service Homes adminis-
tration, and in view of the handicaps he
had to work under it is not surprising that
he failed. As the Government had nothing
to expect from him he was sacrificed. The
Repatriation Commissioners are bungling
their job along different lines. When the
Government is blamed for the losses in-
curred in connection with the soldiers’ homes
it passes the rebuke on to people like Colonel
Walker; and when protests are heard
against the Repatriation Commission’s
treatment of certain pensioners, the Govern-
ment replies that the members of the Com-
mission are themselves soldiers. As these
officials are outside publid control their per-
sistence in wrongdoing is simply a matter
of the thickness of their hides plus their
attachment, to their salaries. Now, it was
to obviate just such an undesirable, not to
say scandalous, state of affairs that the
doctrine of Ministerial Responsibility was
evolved —the rule which says that Ministers
may not shelter behind their subordinates.
In Mr. Ashworth’s nhrase, to which the
Minister for Repatriation took such strong
exceptidn, it is “the official and political
chiefs who should he held responsible for
bad administration.” Whipping-boys have
been out of date for five or six centui'ies.
Let there be Piecework!
The old year having been deposited where
its bones will do least harm, there is a chance
of a return to sanity —and piecework. A
return in every possible direction to pay-
ment by results is necessary, else the pro-
gressive dry-rot of things will leave practi-
cally no results. Nobody expects the best
work when the remuneration, whether it is
mere food, clothes and accommodation in a
gaol or something more outside, is a flat
wage, which can be earned by being the
second-worst person on the job. (To be the
very worst is risky.) The position is extra-
bad in a country where the ignorant and
credulous type of worker (and the Australian
worker, when some eloquent imported wind-
bag asks for the loan of his ear with a tale
out of Kakl Marx, is easy prey) has three
fixed ideas: (1) That work is merely a sort
of episode between loans, they being the real
thing; (2) that an employee or “wage-
slave” must always remain one unless he
revolts, any attempt to become an employer
being an effort to join the enemy; (•>) that
wages may quite easily exceed the value of
the goods produced, so that production is a
secondary matter. In Australia during the
year that has finished the output per worker
in those industries where output can be
measured up was barely two-thirds of what it
was less than 10 years ago, and when prices
began to go down towards the old level, and
wages didn’t go down, and production didn’t
go up, a crash was imminent. It is charged
against some big employers that they delib-
erately selected the days before Christmas
for a stoppage, and doubtless they did. J hey
had to choose some date, since stoppage was
inevitable, and this was a convenient land-
mark. Besides, one of the triumphs of the
new order had been to make the season one
of considerable holiday on full, pay, and
employers who saw the selling price of their
output falling day by day could no longer
afford the luxury of keeping unproductive
retainers. There is really no need yet to cut
wages—the collapse in prices hasn’t gone so
far —but there is need to do the old amount
of honest work for the same wage; and that
the people who discourse on Karl Marx
forbid. Abundant work is waiting to be
done and paid for, but it is left alone on
principle. Thus in the nine months to the end
of September, 11)21, in Sydney and suburbs,
2575 fewer buildings were put up than in
the first nine months of 1920. and 21 mil-
lions less was spent. The breaking-point had
been reached, and the short-week principle
became the short-work principle. In the same
period the State went, into debt nearly
10 millions to pay for imports it couldn’t
afford in order to maintain the protest
against work. On the other hand, the
acceptance of charity has become a rooted
habit, in the Big City, anyhow, and men-
dicancy is an art. This is natural enough.
If a Government can convert the people
into opium fiends, and it controls the opium
supply, and its fall may mean opium-stop-
page, it is likely to have a great run. The
Dooley Government and to a less degree
the Theodore Government deliberately set
out to convert the people into charity “bum-
mers.” The Federal baby bonus was a be-
ginning. It, was the first pauper dole to
those who were neither old nor infirm. Later
there came a deliberate cultivation of
paupers—a class tied to the Ministry by
allowances and grocery orders, and fearing
above all things lest their patrons should
drop out and the patronage and the broken
victuals cease, for many of these industrial
eunuchs have lost all taste for independence,
as they were meant to do. Men who have
the business of doling out charity tell amaz-
ing tales of able-bodied men in full work
at full nay, and of well-dressed women who,
as cross-examination reveals, have £5 or
£6 a week to spend, clamoring for relief on
the ground that they may as well have it
as the next person. They swarm, whining,
lying, fawning and sometimes threatening
when refused—like the flea-bitten beggars
that haunt an Asiatic port. They are a
dreadful contrast to the upstanding Austra-
lian of our dreams, and the one source of
consolation is that they are mostly in the
city.

The Gratuity Bond Shark Asjain.
Before the Westralian Assembly retired
from business until the winter it received
a report from the Select Committee which
has been investigating hundreds of more or
less questionable transactions in soldiers’
gratuity bonds. By comparison with the
general run of such literature, it is a re-
freshingly concise and outspoken document.
In the course of its operations the committee
held 23 public sittings, examined 92 wit-
nesses and received 135 complaints in writ-
ing, in addition to which “many trans-
actions were adjusted privately between the
parties concerned immediately after its ap-
pointment.” Not counting these private
settlements, which are legitimately attri-
buted to the moral effect of its inquiries, it
has been instrumental in recovering £lO,lOO.
for 500 Diggers, in sums ranging from £5
to £4O. Most of the gentry who have been
compelled to disgorge were land jobbers,
concerning whose proceedings the committee
remarks that “many soldiers were sold land
at fictitiously high" values and deliberately
exploited.” Other philanthropists whose
transactions were reviewed professed to
have given hard-up warriors—presumably
perfect strangers—the full face value of
their bonds, plus accrued interest, and pro-
duced statutory declarations from the sellers
to prove it. Considering that the gratuity
bonds rank as non-negotiable securities and
that negotiable war stock has depreciated
as much as 7 per cent., the committee was
gloomily incredulous, more especially as
“several soldiers swore and many complained
in writing that as much as 25 per cent, was
deducted from the amount of the bond,”
but in nearly every case it had to stop at
being incredulous because the necessary
corroborative evidence was lacking. In one
instance, however, two witnesses —father
and daughter—testified that a civil servant
had exacted £27 for cashing a £97 bond.
To follow up matters not already finalised
the committee recommended :
(1) That the Minister for Justice, through the
officials of the Crown Law Department, should take
immediate steps to investigate the transactions of
Dr. Wrioht, James Chesters, John Kelly, the Mia
Mia Pastoral Co., Ltd., and others, with a view to
prosecution.
(2) That the attention of the Public Service Com-
missioner be invited to Mr. F. L. Spencer’s admis-
sions that he cashed gratuity bonds in office hours,
and kept large sums of private money in the official
safe.
(3) That the members of the committee be ap-
pointed a Royal Commission without pay, to permit
the examination of Louis Abrahams and others. The
committee is convinced that Louis Abrahams deli-
berately avoided examination at its hands by absent-
ing himself from the "State.
The naive request in No. 3 (it was imme-
diately granted) must be an Australian re-
c°rd. Anyhow, the Westralian committee
is entitled to the credit of having rendered
good service to the Diggers in an unostenta-
tious and unselfish spirit. And it has set
a useful example to politicians in the other
States. It has shown them a way by which
probably £150,000 may be restored to the
victims of the unspeakable gratuity-bond
thug: for it wasn't only in Westralia, with
340,000 people in a Commonwealth of 51
millions, that the necessitous soldier and
soldier’s widow were cold-bloodedly rooked.
A either was all the jobbery confined to land-
sharks and money-lenders. Valuable evi-
dence might be got from women who smashed
their bonds in ragshops, and the obscurity
that envelops the transactions of dealers in
shoddy furniture should be enthusiastically
pierced. When the State Parliaments re-
assemble none of them should be without
its gratuity-bond committee. Also, in every
case where there is prima facie evidence of
swindling a prosecution should be insisted
upon. Mere surrender of the booty is not
enough.

The Watch on the Rhine.
The reluctance of France to go the whole
way with her Allies in the matter of disarma-
ment arouses a great deal of ignorant com-
ment. France, which made the greatest
sacrifices, for it was on French land that most
of the war was fought, has been the neglected
member of the partnership. Italy hardly
needs any army now except to prevent its
anarchists upsetting the ballot-box on polling
day. Its old Austrian oppressor has been
broken into small dust, very little by Italy’s
own efforts, and it has gained a new mountain
frontier that is worth a million men for de-
fence. Serbia and Roumania have gained
much territory and better frontiers, and their
two deadly enemies, Austria and Turkey,
have been put past harming them. Britain
has gained most of all in point of safety. The
Huh has been shifted from John Bull’s
borders and his neighborhood everywhere —in
Africa, in China, in Papua and in the Pacific.
He has also been removed in the most sweep-
ing and emphatic fashion from John B.'s
home frontier, the North Sea. But France
is left facing a strong, truculent and whollv
unrepentant Hunland —across a chalk-line on
a plain, so far as much of the common border
goes. If France had been permitted to annex
the Rhine as far as Coblenz, that great en-
trenchment would have enabled her to dis-
pense with 500,(J00 men. But that would
have involved the minor evil of putting a few
Germans under French rule unless they pre-
ferred to leave. Pious objection was made on
the ground that one white race should not
rule another without the other’s full consent
-—unless the outrage is of long standing, in
which case • the race on top can do
as it pleases. (This applies only to
Allies who, being good people, are allowed
to be wickeder than bad people, and
the owner or oppressor judges the case
himself and returns a unanimous verdict.)
The republic has no illusions about
Hun disarmament. An illicit navy can’t
well be built and concealed. An army,
quite strong enough to make huge
trouble for a smaller nation that has
hung up its sword to rust, can. Prussia
hid away just such an army after Napoleon
I. disarmed it. Other armies can be impro-
vised, as Kitchener’s was, after the war
begins. Airships may be “planted,” and
every harmless dye-works is a poison-gas
factory by nature. France knows that
she may have to fight the next war alone.
Serbia, Roumania, Montenegro and Italy were
in the last one on Austria’s account, and
there is no longer any Austria. Russia was
in it ion Serbia’s account, but there is no
longer any Russia, except a possibly hostile
one. Britain came in partly because of Bel-
gium, which the maddest Hun will hardl”
violate at the beginning of the next war, and
partly because it was tired of watching the
Hun fleet, and the Hun fleet has passed away.
The United States shows very little disposi-
tion to change its old isolated frame of mind.
On the other hand, some old Allies may eve"
be active enemies. And with 2000 ruined
towns, villages and hamlets to rebuild, and
no Hun indemnity coming in to rebuild with,
and the best of her population buried, France
is a shadow of her old self. What wonder,;
then, that she fears having to fight her big-
enemy single-handed with a chalk-line for an
entrenchment, and makes every effort to avert
the catastrophe?

Victoria Asks for Yesterday.
A State-Rights party has been formed in
Victoria to battle for the putting back of
our Constitutional clock. The nominal origin
of the movement is the recent registration
of the State Public Service Union as an
organisation under the Commonwealth Arbi-
tration Act; but trouble has been brewing
ever since the Full Bench of the High Court
upheld the decision of Justice Higgins that
the Commonwealth has power to control the
instrumentalities of a State. The agitation
has the support of the Victorian dailies, as
it will have the support of those of N. S.
Wales should it extend over the border, if
only because these businesses hold that every
step nearer to unification is a fresh menace
to the privileges they enjoy from the State
railways. There are several methods by
which the Constitution can be made to mean
something other than the High Court savs
it means. A Referendum Bill may be passed
in the Representatives, or it may be forced
on the country by the Senate. The Argus
favors the second device, and is cynical
enough to supply its reason: —
There is only one member of the Labor party in
the Senate; though there are several devoted fol-
lowers of the Prime Minister. Mr. Hughes! would
be very loth to submit any proposed alteration to
the electors.
Both the Age and the Argus have the hardi-
hood to suggest that the situation which
arose out of the interpretation put on the
Trade and Commerce clause by Chief Justice
Griffith and Justices Barton and O’Con-

The New Year in Ireland.
The attitude of the Hail Eireann to the Irish
treaty was neither here nor there from the
moment the document was understood. Irish
Nationalists, in the mass, cannot help being
tor the agreement, since, in practice, it offers
all they asked for and sometning over. The
Republican idea was that Britain should pro-
claim a sort of Monroe doctrine as a solu-
tion of the strategic question. But if hairs
are to be split in the name of patriotism, the
proclamation of a Monroe doctrine is as
much a denial of complete independence as
the arrangement which has met with the
approval of the Irish delegates. The- dif-
ference is that, whereas, say, a South Ameri-
can State has to have a fleet of sorts for
police purposes, Ireland will be policed by
sea free of charge as a return for allowing
the R.N. to spend money in Dublin and Bel-
fast. In every other direction the Irish
State will be as free as England. So well is
this understood that some of the Dail Eireann
speakers seem to have shocked the English
press by talking of the possibility of seces-
sion later on. But a constitutional right
of secession has been asserted by every self-
governing dominion without any damage to
the ties of Empire. In the last resort it is
not sentiment that holds the Empire together
—though sentiment has its value, no doubt
community of interest. A country
like Australia cannot afford to be outside
the Empire; and if that applies to us it
applies far more to Ireland, from which
Great Britain buys year by year millions
of pounds’ worth of cattle and beef and farm
produce and drink, and which depends on
the mainland for nearly all its coal. G. B.
Shaw is often quoted as having said, “We
need England; and if she tries to break
away from us we’ll simply have to recon-
quer her,” and that pretty well represents
the view of practical Ireland as distin-
guished from that of professional fanatics
such as the Englishman Chieders and the
American Df. Valera. England’s real diffi-
culty will be to persuade Ulster that the
principles on which a historic party has
based its existence for generations • are so
much political flam. Still, an equally awk-
ward situation faced Lord Derry in 186C>
when the supposedly conflicting interests of
the French and British in Canada had to
be reconciled. His solution (Dominion of
Canada Act, 1867) was to give Quebec
(French and R.C.) equal representation in
the Senate with Ontario and double that
of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Ulster
ought to be satisfied with some such settle-
ment, and the South has so much to gain
by getting the four hostile counties into
the Union that it is likely to agree to any
proposal in reason. But, even if a formula
of this sort is accepted, there will stffl be
obstacles to peace. Ireland is evidently
going to possess not one De Wet or
Hertzog party but two; and two separate
sets of furious irreconcilables is a big handi-
cap for any new State to carry.

The New Dominion Status.
J. B. Dalley in further. reply to G. C.
Dixon :
In my remarks (B. 15/12/’2l) on G. C. Dixon’s
contribution about Dominion Status, I put forward
two main propositions. The first was that consti-
tutionally, except for one thing, we had “achieved
all the characteristics of a sovereign State.”
his has been admitted not only by Hughes
and Smuts (who happen to be specialists on the
subject) but by such supreme British authorities as
hord Birkenhead and Lord Parmoor, and, amongst
the politicians, by Lord Harcourt (Liberal) and
Joseph Chamberlain (Unionist). My other sugges-
tion was that nothing will ever get Australia respect,
or anything else worth having, but force of arms.
If I heard this expressed once in Egypt and in
Prance, by Diggers who were nothing if not loyal,
1 heard it a hundred times. Every one of these
men looked forward to a post-war Australia in
which we should maintain our war effort relatively
to the rest of the Empire. Not, however, with an.y
demented idea of “turning 0 n the Mother Country,”
but for the credit of Australia and the security’ of
Britain. By way of reply Mr. Dixon inquires:
Just what would we gain by severing our connec-
tion with the Crown and the Imperial Parliament ?
What advantage, political or economic, would we
gain if we threw off our allegiance?” And he
announces that, “like most other young Australians
who are not biased against the British Government
by the Irish question,” he is “quite satisfied with
an arrangement which offers all the advantages of
complete independence without any of its dangers”:
and proceeds to accuse me of “howling” and “lament-
ing, ’ neither of which is i n my line. I have two
letters written to my father by his personal friend
though political opponent, Henry Parkes. In them
Parkes offers the opinion that the despatch of the
Soudan contingent—the first expeditionary force that
ever left Australia—was unconstitutional and dis-
loyal. So sincere was he that he talked in Parlia-
ment of getting my father impeached, and actually
took some steps in that direction. There is no
mention of the good old Irish question in these mis-
sives, but I have no doubt Parkes dragged it into
the controversy later. And we all know that the
“Geebungs” who opposed the sending of the con-
tingent on the ground that armaments, the national-
THE DISCORDANT NOTE.
ist spirit and painter-cutting were synonymous, asked'
what N. S. Wales had to gain by severing its con-
nection with the Crown, the Union .Jack and the
Imperial Parliament. Reading G. C. Dixon in con-
junction with the above, we see that history repeats
itself even in its maddest irrelevancies.
The Famine in Russia.
Dear Bulletin, —I notice that Miss Mar-
garet Thorp demurs at my view that the
Russian famine business is better left alone.
The lady states that the grain belt in the
Volga province measures 800 miles by 500.
I admit the fact, but I don’t see what is to be
fl 2 r > e about it. In this area —about the size
ot Bouth Australia—the crop has failed, as it
does in South Aus. But it is a well-rained-
upon country, quite unlike South Aus., with
great rivers calculated to madden that dry
place with envy ; and when a land like that
is chronically in such a condition that one
crop failure makes it the world’s duty to rush
to the rescue with millions of money, then
the world has too big a contract on hand.
There are limits to its duty to chronic
failures. Our scanty Russian population has
been amazingly active in the effort to intro-
duce Sovietism here, and deprive our people
of their self-governing, rights, and confer on
us by force all the horrors they seem to have
brought on themselves—though their meddle-
some leaders of the Peter Simonoff type
deny that there are any horrors, and say Rus-
sia is a paradise, in which case aid looks
superfluous. There are limits to our grati-
tude, anyhow. Why should we rush
in at any rate, till this discrepancy
is cleared up? Personally I think
there was some sense about Cain, who
asked cautiously if he was his brother’s
keeper instead of rushing into unlimited lia-
bility, and very little sense about Mrs. Jei -
laby, the lady with the shamefully neglected
home, who constituted' herself universal pro-
vider for the folk at Borrioboola Gha on the
left bank of the Niven Speaking of homes,
our own calls for some attention. I would
like to point out that every penny of real
money in Australia is debt, and" is owed
twice or thrice over. Not unavoidable war
debt, nor debt that is represented by assets
that make even a decent pretence of being-
something profitable, so that they can be
handed down to posterity along with the
crushing liability. Just mean, loafing,
swindle-and-robbery debt. I have tried for
30 years to explain to prominent and well-
advertised philanthropists and others that
this selling of the children, body and soul,
into bondage, to largely-foreign money-
lenders, for the sake of present ease and
luxury, is a vile form of white-slave traffic
which is dragging the soul of this coun-
try (if it has any soul left) down to per-
dition. I don’t know that I have roped in a
single philanthropist— not even the greasiest.
As this evil practice not only continues
but is even more virulent than ever, I would
like to remark that every penny given, with
complacency and self-satisfaction, to Russia
is the proceeds of robbery and is acquired
by trading in the blood and bone and flesh of
the children and the children’s children. How-
ever unknown to those who fuss earnestly in
the cause, the Curse of Pecksniff is
on the contribution. —Yours respectfully,
Henry Horsecollar.

The Church Guardian of S. Aus., the offi-
cial organ of the Anglicans in that State,
prints a letter from Joe Daltry, an earnest
young church worker who went to California
from Adelaide in 1919. To get the full flavor
of it, one must remember that the writer
confesses that he is pained by what he
honestly records : : —
_ If Australia is going to experiment with Prohibi-
tion it would be well for every citizen to know as
much as possible about the results of total dryness
in America. I have never been in any place in
California for more than a few days without finding
out where I could obtain strong alcoholic drink of
some kind, and I have never sought the knowledge.
From what 1 can gather California is no different
from the rest of the United States. Whisky sells as
a rule for about 50 dollars a gallon; never much
less,. often considerably more. Whisky of similar
quality would sell in Adelaide for about 30s. a gal-
lon. Fifty dollars at the present exchange is about
£l4. One never need look very far for a purchaser
at such prices, and no salesmanship is required. If
it is “bootleg” it may be liquor which has been
made from, perfectly good materials and is of poor
quality because it is very new, but is more likely to
be any one of the numerous vile concoctions which
literally flood the market and are to cause
anything from a violent sickness to death. This
morning’s paper has an account of some 50 soldiers
being smitten with blindness as a result of drinking
bootleg brandy. In some cases total blindness has
resulted ; in. others recovery, is possible. The most
serious result of Prohibition, perhaps, is the very
general attitude of contempt for the law which has
made itself apparent. A large number 6f people,
whether a majority of the population or not I don’t
know, certainly a very great majority of my acquaint-
ances, have come to regard the evasion and breaking
of the liquor laws with absolutely easy consciences.
Men and women in every rank of life buy liquor
habitually, and have come to regard it as one of the
commonplaces of life, like buying groceries. From
this there has come to be a contempt of all laws....
Altogether Prohibition does not, and with the people
in their present frame of mind can not, prohibit.
The evidence brings The Bulletin back
every time to regulation—strict regulation
which, while offering the people no excuse
for becoming a nation of furtive law-breakers,
would yet remove three-fourths 3f the present
ill effects of the liquor traffic. Reformers
who stand in the way of that regulation are
surely carrying a heavy moral responsibility.
From one of the professorial class: —
At Melbourne ’Varsity this year three medical
practitioners, Drs. Ponsonby, Cole and Rowan, got
the diploma of Public Health —the first time it has
been awarded for nearly seven years. Despite that
this diploma renders the holder eligible for a number
of positions otherwise denied him, and that the know-
ledge gained while studying for it is of enormous
value to him in ordinary practice, less than 1 per
cent, of the medical men in the Commonwealth own
it, and of those half acquired it abroad. The reason
that it is so rarely sought is that a man can qualify
to practise without it. Even the degree of M.D.,
which differs from the diploma inasmuch as it is
granted after examination in one specific subject
instead of half-a-dozen, is awarded annually only
to a comparatively small number. In England some-
thing like 50 per cent, of graduates in medicine
obtain a higher degree within five years of taking
their first degree. In Australia it is doubtful if
2 per cent, do so within 10 years of graduating.
Which is one of the reasons why the practice of
medicine in this country has become a mere job.
And where it isn't one of the reasons it is one
of the results.
~
“0.K.” : Boxing Day, like Easter Monday,
always yields me a chuckle, for on those
days I, being a Melbourne citizen, am
charged 25 per cent, extra on my ordinary
tram fare, the State Government having
taken over the wicked private monopoly at
which I used to rail in my more innocent
days. Every holiday time, when called
upon to pay twopence-ha’penny instead of
the ordinary 2d., I ruminate on the differ-
ence between my early dreams of State
Socialism and the reality as far as it has
got. The old M.M.T. Co. represented Capi-
talism, with grasping fingers on the throat
of the long-suffering masses. The acquisi-
tion of the business was another step in the
direction of Socialism. The practical differ-
ence, we discover, is that Socialism costs
more, and its servants, being more securely
entrenched, are more offensive. Theoreti-
cally, profits from the tramway traffic should
go towards defraying the cost of govern-
ment. Actually, the profits, increased by
special holiday exactions, go to swell the
expenditure on government. The more
money that can be raked into the political
exchequer the more can be devoted to politi-
cal patronage. So extortion has become part
of the political game, and Socialism has be-
come merely a pretext for adding to the
machinery of extortion.
The One Big Union has a funeral: —
The N.A.1.U., the One Big Union that was to bring
the Millennium to the workers of the N.T., is dead.
It lived three months, and there were no mourners
at the funeral. The Railway Department has taken
over the wharf and the bond, and anyone is at
liberty to do his own carting. Formerly no one
without a union ticket could do any carting from
the bond, the railway or the jetty. Yet every carter
employed non-union black-labor abos., who got
their tucker and tobacco and two or three shil-
lings a week for eight to 15 hours’ toil a daj’.
Their employers made money hand over fist,
for they charged full union rates for all work done.
At present, there are no unions, properly speaking,
in the N.T. A clerk can take on carting, a meat-
worker go plumbing, a painter become a blacksmith
—-it is all free labor now. And Chinese servants
begin to be seen, in the hotels. That is the sorry
pass to which the direct-actionists haye broygiit
trade unionism in the one Australian town in .which
it was supreme. It is a shipwreck, and the cry
“Every man for himself!” has gone up among the
few survivors.
“Hanno” detects an odor of ancient fish:—
For some time the Age has been making vigorous
efforts to stir up public feeling over the alleged ill-
treatment of the natives in the mandated territories
of New Guinea. Both in the old German days and
throughout the greater part of the Australian mili-
tary regime, I saw some hundreds of natives flogged,
and, except for one or two isolated cases of brutality
by private individuals, who were speedily dealt with
by the authorities, there was nothing that savored
of cruelty. Mentally the native is a child and must
be handled as one. The only alternative to flogging,
which consists generally of front five to ten cuts with
a cane, administered so as not to break the skin,
is to lock delinquent natives up in a gaol-compound
and feed and clothe them. Seeing that the offender
has to scratch hard in ordinary circumstances for
as much as a bare living, it is generally difficult to
get him to understand that this is punishment at all.
If the Age knows of a better method of handling
natives, it should lose no time in announcing it;
but meantime it is worth remembering that the
administration of the mandated territories comes up
for review a few years hence, when there, will pro-
bably be any number of contestants of Australia’s
claim to be allowed to keep the islands, and to whom
the Age’s articles will come in handy as support
for their contention that the Commonwealth has
misgoverned the place. No other nation possessing
a mandate is vigorously engaged in running itself
down through its own press, but rather, with a view
to this future review, the majority are extolling the
benefits that have come with their administration.


IS THIS A RECORD?

You Really Ride
f on Goodrich Tires
Mr. Harold L. Hunt, of Mummel, N.S.W., writes:—
“The Goodrich tyres I purchased from you have been running consistently for 334
years on the back wheels of my Ford car.
“During that period I have covered about 10,000 miles—most of this mileage has
been covered with the platform top fitted to the chassis, carrying loads up to three-
quarters of a ton.
“For 234 years these tyres have never shifted from the rims.
“I am more than satisfied with the results these tyres have given me, and for hard
and heavy work I know of nothing better.”

POLITICAL
POINTS.
N.S.W. Premier Dooley got away with a
full 12 months’ Estimates before scuttling
into recess; but he assured the House that,
though provided against the need to do any-
thing till July or August, that fact “will
make not one day’s difference to the date of
the elections.” The Bulletin doesn’t ex-
pect it will. The real date for an election
is March 20, 1923, unless George Fuller gets
a new set of tactics.
The rearrangement of Federal electoral
boundaries is another chapter in the history
of blighted provinces and bloated capitals.
In N. S. Wales the country loses two seats
and the city gains three. In Victoria two
cocky constituencies are wiped out and
another electorate arises in the subbubs.
When the boundary commissioners counted
heads they found 472,417 adults in the Vic.
metropolis and 383,367 in_ the provinces, the
capital having added 122,575 to its electoral
population in nine years and the country a
mere 5668. So Melbourne is to have 11
members in the next Parliament and the rest
of Victoria will be represented by nine. It
is a calamitous business.
The Bulletin gets tired of hearing from
Fihelly and Dooley that the country (mean-
ing always the wage-paying class) can
“stand” more taxation, as if that, suppos-
ing it to be true, was a sufficient reason
for inventing new taxes. This paper be-
lieves that either Dooley or Fihelly could
stand 50 lashes on his bare fat back, but
that is no reason why he should get them.
Not all of them, anyhow.
From an old Parliamentary hand :
N.S.W. Speaker Levy’s suggestion that an out-
sider should be appointed Speaker would, if adopted,
endow Dooley and his successors with the same
power as Queensland Premiers have with regard to
the Presidency of the Leg. Council. Levy’s party
strongly disapproved when Theodore made Lennon
Lieut.-Governor and then President of the Upper
House because it was so markedly a partisan appoint-
-ment. Does he expect. that things would be any
better in a. State Assembly under his scheme? If
he had suggested that the whole State while elect-
ing a House should pick one extra as Speaker he
might have said something that would catch on.
When Colebatch, the Westralian Minister
of Education, was temporarily leading the
Lefroy Ministry, he signed a contract for
the purchase of a 15-mile railway from a
lime and cement co. Cabinet had decided to
buy subject to Parliamentary sanction, but
this condition didn’t appear in the contract,
which Colebatch signed without running his
eye over it. Lefroy went out and Mitchell
came in, and, things being rather slack in
the lime and cement line, the company men-
tioned that it would like the money. Pro-
testing feebiy that it wasn’t his funeral,
Mitchell put the item (£70,000) on last
month’s loan estimates. Collier, the Oppo-
sition leader, replied with a no-confidence
motion, in the course of which he said harsh
things about “Cocky” Robinson, Lefroy’s
Attorney-General, whose firm had acted for
the lime and cement co. The voting being
on party lines, the Government had an easy
victory/ but if he didn’t happen to be Mit-
chell’s closest pal Colebatch would be a
gone coon. In spite of his talents for de-
bate and destructive criticism he has proved
a singularly poor administrator. The Cockies
have had no use for him since he agreed to
let the Ma State have wheat at 7s. Bd. a
bushel when 10s. and more could be got
abroad.
The new seat Melbourne will have in the
House of Reps, as a result of the redistribu-
tion is to be hewn out of Balaclava, Henty
and Ivooyong, all three solidly Nationalist.
Nothing could be easier for Vic. Premier
Lawson, who, like McGirr, of the Ma State,
and Fihelly, of Queensland, has been talking
lately of entering the larger politics.
In forming his N.S.W. Cabinet Fuller
appointed Perdriau Minister for Business
Undertakings apart from railways and tram-
ways. There was no reason except that
Dooley, struggling to find portfolios for
everybody, had made a hanger-on Minister
for the State Fish Shop and other trifles.
These things want not a Minister but a cap-
able clerk of works. Fuller had a chance
to show that he was a real economiser. It
was, in fact, about the only chance he had;
and he threw it away.
One of the bills that were dropped when
Vic. State Parliament scooted off for its
holidays was the Masseurs’ Registration
Bill. Alf Peters, the father of it, who has
been 12 years battling to get protection for
his calling, received congratulations on the
realisation of his hopes, and actually gave a
little dinner to celebrate the victory. For
the Masseurs’ Registration Bill, after pass-
ing through the Council, where it originated,
had been but slightly amended in the
Assembly and returned to its birthplace for
final acceptance. Yet before the acceptance
could be recorded the Christmas rush set
PUTTING HIS NOSE TO THE GRINDSTONE.
“The year 1922 started with a public debt of approximately £860,000,000, about equally divided
between Commonwealth and States. Ten years ago the total was £295,000,000."
THE VISITOR: “Veil, so little 1922 has arrived, has he? Tell him his dear uncle called
vith a little hill for £860,000,000 that vos lent his father and his grandfather, vill
you, my dear?”
in and the Council’s own little bit of legis-
lation was pushed aside. For a few more
months, therefore, it will be open to any
unenlightened rubber to diagnose a swelling
in the groin as a muscular disturbance, and
remove it with a few vigorous thumbings
which will put an abscess, full of poison mto
circulation over the victim’s system., lhe
lield-over bill stipulates for registration by
a board consisting of three masseurs and
two medical men.
“Radical” : At the moment The Bulletin
was congratulating the Queensland Govern-
ment on the opposition of certain Ministers
to night racing, there was opened in Too-
woomba a so-called “Liberty Fair” a
jumble of miscellaneous gambles, from
Yankee sweat up and down, the object being
to provide funds to help the Toowoomba
Trades Hall and subsidise the Standard
(Labor) newspaper. This shameless exhibition
is run under Government permit, and under
Labor auspices, and has been touring
Queensland off and on for three years, fool-
ing simpletons, corrupting young men and
women and initiating children into financial
debauchery. The Golden Casket lottery is
doing mischief enough, but it is virtue com-
pared with the Liberty Fair iniquity. Every
few weeks the Government, to keep its repu-
tation sweet, raids a two-up school or dances
a fandango over some little fan-tan den, and
now it foams at the mouth about night
racing. Pah! An ounce of civet, good
apothecary!
The world won’t make much progress
towards peace until each little bit of it
leaves off throwing hasty clods at the rest,
and, instead, tries to get the others’ point
of view. Britain is just at present throwing
the hasty clod at France for wanting sub-
marines practically without limit. The
truth is that the two look at subs, from
quite different angles. For a country that
can grow its own food or get supplies by
land the sub. represents a cheap kind of sea
defence. But to one who brings his victuals
in hundreds of floating warehouses from the
farthest seas they are such an accursed nui-
sance that naturally he wants to rule them
out as pirates. As it happens in this matter
Australia and France are in somewhat simi-
lar boats. And if we, like France, insisted
on the right to protect our shores with subs.,
it wouldn’t be from sheer cussedness, as the
busy British mischief-making propagandist
is trying to make the world believe it is in
the case of France.
If the N.S.W, Government comes back
alive from an election held under its own
expert management, or if it can do somehow
without an election, it proposes to bump
up the income-tax next May. Or, rather, in-
tends to bump up the tax on the larger in-
comes and on companies, and lighten it on
the smaller sort. The Dooley hatred of com-
panies is an obsession ; yet companies are for
the most part merely combinations of people
who are too poor to do big things single-
handed, but like to get things done rather
than spend their time making speeches or
attending the races. When the wage-paying
class has thus got the knock-out it is in-
tended that it shall continue paying wages
on the old scale. But the miracle may not
come off. Some miracles don’t.
Hun capitalists have, it is estimated,
£50,000,000 of gold in foreign banks, which
is one of the aggravations of the case. If
it was in Germany it could be seized to
make good a default in the indemnity, but it
isn’t. If it was Hun Government money
abroad it could be seized, but it isn’t —not
ostensibly, though everybody who knows his
Hun suspects. Every attempt to make the
Hun pay brings up against some foolish,
pious restriction pushed by Woodrow Wil-
son into the peace bargain, which his own
Senate repudiated, leaving the Allies with it
on their hands. Wilson was making his
peace with God by forgiving other people’s
enemies, and how he gets on with God may
be known later.
I’ ifty-six bills of a sort were passed by the
\ ic. Parliament last session. The number
recalls John Gavan Duffy’s comment on the
Irvine s team s decision to reduce the number
of members of the Assembly from 95 to 56,
instead of the 46 proposed by Ivyabrama-
pootra. Said John: “The battle waxed
strong in Cabinet, and then Mr. Shiels’s
voice was heard above the din declaring that
as 56 was half a hundred-weight it was a
suitable number and should be adopted. That
settled it.” Mr. Irvine gave judgment ac-
cordingly, and here we have it. But when
the bill became an Act the number fixed was
68 —nearly a stone more.
“H.S.” on a dog that won’t lie down:—
Our Australian strain ot' the Yellow Pup is a
much more muddled variety than the original Ulster
breed. Orangeism in Ireland has always known what
it wanted, and usually got it. Here —well, in the
recent Parramatta election the P.W.A. decided that
Flatten was the man to endorse, while in last week’s
election for the Vic. Leg. Council (Melbourne Pro-
vince) the Walls-of-Derry people plumped for Nor-
man Bayles. Politically the support of Orangeism
doesn’t seem to signify much either way: Pratten
won well and Bayles got well licked. But
all the candidates in both elections were
Protestants; so the tactics of the organisation
which poses as the defender of the faith could only
have had the effect of dividing Protestants. And
the ill-feeling so created is absolutely futile, inas-
much as most of the constructive proposals of the
Orange platforms, while suited to a French or a
Belgian Constitution, are impossible of achievement
under ours or any other British Constitution.
One of the most untenable positions in
connection with tjie recent defeat of Dooley
was that occupied by Arthur, M.L.A. If
he doesn’t believe in Labor’s Motherhood
Endowment scheme, he is the biggest poli-
tical fraud the Ma State has: if he does he
is a traitor to it. It is, of course, possible for
any honest man either to argue on the one
hand that Motherhood Endowment is a
ruinous imposition on the taxpayers, and
a device which has been shown time and
again to be useless for the purpose intended,
or to claim, on the other, that it must save
the lives of thousands of children, assist the
birth-rate and do no more than justice to
the most deserving section of the com-
munity. Dr. Arthur has been expounding
the second view for months past. Then
the Nationalist whip cracked. And in a
moment the clamorous humanitarian was
swamped in the docile party-man. The
splendid mothers and fathers and their un-
born children were all sacrificed on the
altar of the anti-Labor Caucus. No wonder
the intelligent section of the public calls for
the wiping out of a system which affects
even reputable men in such a fashion.
In one of his expansive moments Fihelly,
the Queensland Treasurer, remarked recently
that “if Queensland had a bigger popu-
lation he would like to see a sinking fund
for all public debts and pay them off
rapidly.” But why drag in population?
When Forrest established the Westralian
sinking fund his State hadn’t a tenth of the
population that pays taxes (or owes them)
to Fihelly. Judging by Fihelly’s record as
a financier his idea of a sinking fund is one
fed with borrowed money. That has become
the Westralian practice under Forrest’s
degenerate successors. But as Ricardo
pointed out a century ago, “no sinking fund
can be efficient for the purpose of diminish-
ing the public debt if it be not derived from
the excess of public revenue over the public
expenditure.” He might have added that
even then it doesn’t diminish the debt if
new loans exceed the sinking fund contribu-
tions. Yet even if a Government persists in
borrowing, a country with a sinking fund
has this advantage—-it can in most cases
stop the holders of an old loan from fleecing
it when repayment falls due.
Governor Nathan says Queensland wants
more milking-machines and fewer type-
writers. Quite correct, of course; but Sir
Matthew will yet realise that Queensland’s
systems of education and government aim
at making town life popular and easy at
the expense of the country, and town" life
has no use for milking-machines. Go into
any secondary school in Bananaland and you
will find that a big majority of the young-
sters are aiming at city occupations, and, if
your secondary school be in a rural district,
you will not find 10 per cent, of the boys
who intend to remain on the farm. In the
city you have all the “advantages” of the
best primary and secondary education; you
get helped bv the State in building a hand-
some semi-villa: you have State butcheries
and fish-shops at your doors; the Civil Ser-
vice and railways are yawning to receive
(and bury) your bright youngsters; amuse-
ments, cinemas, State refreshment rooms,
cheap trams are all at your disposal—why,
then, worry about milking-machines? When
the country gets into financial straits up go
the railway fares and freights, and up go
land and income taxes, and from these im-
positions 70 per cent, of town dwellers are
practically free. In the circumstances it’s
no good belauding the mechanical milker and
anathematising the mechanical scribbler.
ANOTHER VICTIM OF CAPITALISM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Narrogin, a cockying hamlet in Westralia, owns a
deficit for which the municipal bull is partly re-
sponsible. In a chivalrous apology for the unpro-
fitable animal, the Mayor says: “Probably he has
been here too long, and competition has become
rather keen in his line of business. The question
is whether we should exchange him or drop out of
this business and leave it to private enterprise.”
Bull, forlorn as a stranded haddock,
Marxian taurus of Narrogin town,
Chewing the cud in your civic paddock,
Your pride, as well as your tail, is down.
Once your favors were madly courted —
Times were prosperous (so were the rates) —
The choicest heifers with you consorted.
Now they’re destined for other mates.
Fly-plagued celibate, how you’ve missed them!
Labor editors, fierce, profuse,
Mark this serf of that loathly system,
Production for profit and not for use 1
Yet, O animal hedonistic,
You of the deficit, lonely, old,
Other experiments socialistic
Share your fortune, so be consoled.
Other collectivist operations
Have thudded like you, O spurned of cows.
Where is the surplus from Theodore’s stations,
Scaddan’s factories, Hughes’s scows?
Where are the profits that fluent geezers
Sought in Government wheat and wool,
Beer and sausages, fishshops, freezers?
Gone like the glory of Narrogin’s bull.
x.s.w.

Capital, increased by £446,113, reached
£2,233,013 during Tooth’s financial year:
£166,113 was raised by new shares issued at
par to holders, and 250,000 fully-paids were
put out to acquire Castleniaine and .Wood
Bros., of Newcastle. That brewery in its
last (and best) year showed gross profits
of £176.214. working exes, and depreciation
took £138,809, and, after providing for taxa-
tion, there was a net profit of approximately
£30,000. The big Sydney co.’s figures have

In the introductory table £6OOO dropped into
an employees’ benefit fund and a similar
amount put aside for workmen’s compensa-
tion have been deducted from profits. 1 lie
increase the latter show' is not much more than
can be accounted for by the earnings of the
Newcastle business and the additional cash
capital. But what Tooth’s says it earns and
what it actually does earn may be very dif-
ferent. No other industry has of late years
had more reason to adopt self-preservation
methods than the brewing: it has been
assaulted from all directions. The no-
license agitation has quietened, but curtailed
trading hours, additional excise and other
taxation, license-reduction, heavier costs and
other troubles have combined to make the
future of the Trade doubtful and the share-
market nervous. Yet everything _ mqst be
going very well with Tooth’s; the increasing
of the ordinary div. to 10 p.c. and the prefs.
to 9 p.c. (the prefs. are guaranteed 6 p.c.,
but when the ords. get 10 p.c. the directors
“may increase the dividend rate to such rate
as they determine”) is a clear indication
that the management is well satisfied with
recent performances.
When Tooth’s took over the Newcastle
Castlemaine brewery the latter showed
£226,822 of reserves, not counting £20,000
of goodwill as an asset. But not a penny of
those large transferred reserves makes an
appearance in Tooth’s published accounts.
That they were genuine reserves was vouched
for by an independent expert valuation
which, during 1920, brought £183,029 to
light in the Newcastle concern. llow the
combined balance-sheet figures of the two
concerns a year ago compare with Tooth’s
latest entries is shown hereunder: —

Net assets £490,366 £2,117,505 £2,607,871 £2,825,674
The first line hints at the extent of the
allowance made for “depreciation” in con-
nection with the Castlemaine’s belongings
and for current contingencies. Tooth’s appa-
rently made an excellent deal when it
acquired £490,(J00 of net assets in the New-
castle district for £250,000 of its own scrip.
Castlemaine shareholders also apparently did
well; they now get 10 p.e., whereas for the
previous 10 years they had averaged less
than 4J p.c. p.a., their 1920 div. being only
6 p.c. The expansion of net assets by
£217,800 during tiie year was, of course, ex-
plained by the £196,113 of new capital got in
from Tooth’s shareholders. Another feature
of the balance-sheet is that £122,322 is in
public securities, deposits and cash. At Sept.
30 there was a surplus of liquid assets over
and above all liabilities of £950,204, or
£400,000 more than the pref. capital. So
4s. 9d. per £1 ordinary share was also repre-
sented by liquid surplus. In addition there
were the brewery, hotel properties, plant,
machinery, etc., with a book value of 225.
3d., but, as the happenings in connection
with the Castlemaine transfer clearly show,
their actual worth is much greater—that
is, so long as Cold Tea or other influences
permit the beer industry to continue on the
present scale. The £226,822 of Castlemaine
reserves which have gone into the stocking
alone represent 2s. 6d. per ordinary share.

Details of the reconstruction given by the
directors do not make possible a satisfactory
linking-up of the entries in-the table. Kauri
Timber began 33 years ago, but struck trouble
in the ’nineties: no div. at all was paid
between 1890-99, and not until 1908 was the
return got above 5 p.c. on written-down capi-
tal—7s. per share had been struck off in ’9B.
In 1919 there were 150,000 shares of 335.
each fully paid and 450,000 paid to 15s. The
first step in the reconstruction was apparently
to get all shares on a level footing by return-
ing 18s. per share to the fully-paids. That
left 600,000 paid to 15s. (£450,000). But
reserves, visible and internal, were tapped for
£300,000 to make paid capital three-quarters
of a million, one 255. paid being issued for
every 15s. paid. In 1919, including the con-
tingency fund, there were visible reserves of
£221,820. No accounts were issued for 1920:
10 p.c. was paid for that year, but no hint
was given as to the extent to which reserves
benefited. Assets in the 1919 accounts
were included on the valuation figures of
1908, less depreciation allowances made dur-
ing the period. When the new valuation
was made last year belongings were found
to have so appreciated in value that though
£300,000 of reserves went to pay 10s. per
share, £158,883 of reserves remained. Ap-
parently all except about £50,000 of the
bonus distribution was provided by accumu-
lated profits; the writing-up of assets and
the disclosure of other hidden reserves seems
to have put £200,000-odd into the list. In
1919 the co. was experiencing difficulties in
getting its sticks to markets. Since then,
however, conditions have been very
able: the directors describe last year as
“exceptionally prosperous.” A comparison
of the figures in the last two columns of this
table bear out that statement: —
1911. 1915. 1919. 1921.
Liabilities . . £52,288 £108,812 £25,023 £120,080

Liquid assets . . 162,997 88,132 144,591 201,602
Though £135,000 of capital was apparently
returned in cash and £111,900 was passed
out in divs. between the two balancing-dates,
at August 31 last the surplus of more or less
liquid assets was £495,535, compared with
£441,447 in 1919. If there have meantime
been no extensive sales of fixed assets or
writing-up of stocks, etc., that performance
is a remarkable one. The past year’s profits
were certainly luscious: the accounts show
net earnings of £93,116, but that was after
writing off £23,382 for depreciation and set-
ting aside £17,503 in specific reserves, such
as for fire and marine insurance. Whether
such handsome returns will continue is
another matter: since 1919 the co. seems
to have found excellent markets for large
stocks which had accumulated when freightage
was difficult. The recent trade depression
has not favored extensive construction pro-
grammes; but last year, after paying
away £60,000 in divs., there was at least
£50.000 left to strengthen the co. The
£158,883 surplus revealed in the reeonstruc-
tion, by the way, is treated by the direc-
tors as a “contingency reserve.”

Note for a start that the present 8 p.c. div.
gives shareholders almost four times as much
as 10 p.c. did in 1911. During the 10 years
paid capital has grown from £71,364 to
£313,724; and the whole of the additions
have been reserve-capitalisations. Recent
disclosed profits have, therefore, given a re-
turn exceeding 55 p,c. on the 1911 capital
without shareholders having been called upon
to finance the expansion of the business, lhe
Intercolonial lias had a remarkable career
since the loan booms of a dozen yeais oi so
ago put life back into the business. Its
subdivisioning lias been very successful and
less risky than in many other instances: the
co. has never been loaded with very laige
parcels of vacant land. There have always
been substantial profits in excess of the
amounts required for the handsome divs. and
these surpluses have been promptly pnt to

ness over the period covered by the table .

In 1920 inner reserves were disclosed: assets
were written up by £78,277 The striking
feature of the table is the curtailment of lia-
bilities while the borrowing connection has
widened. The Intercolonial is in an exce O
tional position among building cos.: for all
practical purposes its operatiou» are financed
bv its own funds. The £13,548 of deposits
and £1509 of sundry creditors at October 31
were easily covered bv till money. Hmt
means that no matter liow bad things may
this co., while financed on such, a basis,
will never be bothered by creditors clamor-
ing for their money, and runs no risk of be-
ing forced into realising at cut-rates. Not-
withstanding the conversion of so much ol
the reserves into capital, the present scrip
is well protected by reserves still untouched.
After payment of the recent div. there were
cash assets of £58,712 in excess of all lia-
bilities equal to almost 3s. 9d. pel % or
capital. There was 245. 3d. more in the
book value of advances, premises and other
property, making total net assets of nearly
28s. to support every £ of scrip. In addi
tion it is practically certain that the
writing-up of assets over a year ago did not
bring to light all the internal reserves.

This co. runs the Premier tote: it holds the
world’s patent rights of the machine mstals
totalisators when it can get orders, and
operates them for the racing clubs Pa d
capital is £191,825 in shares of £1 each,
.and there is also a debenture debt of £6OOO.
Other debts amount to £2994. On the
other side are these assets: “I atent rights

Perth), prepayments, etc., £176,828. boon
debts, £26,361; stocks and uncompleted con-
tracts, £7371; property, etc., £6105; cash
and deposits, £11,314. The profits made
so far have come from operations m the
Commonwealth and Maoriland. Managing-
director G. M. Bethell hawked the machine
abroad for several years, but though racing
clubs everywhere appear to have been im-
pressed bv the automatic Australian tote no
business has so far been done. However,
negotiations are still proceeding, and Mr
Bethell “is confident that business must
sooner or later eventuate.” The co.’s future
depends a good deal on the extent to which
overseas rights can be sold, and prospects in
that respect are not so cheerful as was anti-
cipated: two years ago the directors ex-
pressed the opinion that the world s rights
alone would bring in an amount considerably
in excess of the big conglomerate goodwill
entry in the balance-sheet. The only busi-
ness done outside Australasia so far has been
a recent contract for two machines for Cey-
lon. There is, however, a possible purchaser
for the rights for Asia. Further machines
are being installed on Australian courses,
and the c-o. has hopes that Victoria will soon
legalise the tote and open up a new field for
exploitation.

That last line would suggest that the direc-
tors overstepped the bounds of prudence
when they suddenly lifted paid capital from
£45,000 to £lOO,OOO by issuing bonus shares
against visible reserves and the war-inflated
value of assets and decided to include good-
will at £7522. Accumulated profits pro-
vided £12,590 of bonus capital, and plant,
etc., apparently had £33,800 added to book
values. During the past year, however, the
co. had to go back a little on its tracks:
paper values slumped, and latest working
profits suffered by stocks having been writ-
ten down to landed costs. For the previous
year, after writing £3395 off plant, lease-
holds and equipment, a net profit of 124
p.c. on the enlarged capital was shown. For
the past 12 months, after adding £4015 to
the amortization and depreciation reserves,
the return was only 4f p.c. So the 5 p.c.
distributed was not wholly earned. How-
ever, the co.’s position is comfortable: —

off its debenture debt at the rate of £lOOO

W. E. Smith, Ltd., should do all right; the
concern is still managed by the people who
so successfully freed it of the trouble it had
got into following its flotation into a public
co. by Earle Hermann and others nearly a
dozen years ago. But to what extent all the
writing-up in 1919 was justified still remains
to be seen. The market meantime assesses
scrip at less than half of its face value.

The £l6OO or so of profit which this little
co. is making each year is earned by the in-
vestment of £21,000-odd of the co.’s own
funds and from handling £1,095,000 of
estates. Though the 15 p.c. divs. look hand-
some profits show only 7 p.c. on total funds ;
so at the moment shareholders could do
equally well by making a gift of the entire
trustee business to somebody and re-invest-
ing their own funds. At present all the
trustee operations do is to keep a small
staff employed and give about £3OO per half-
year over and above exes. For all that it
is a nice, comfortable little business, and as
it has been established 34 years it has be-
come one of the Speck’s institutions. Per-
haps one of these days it will go the same
way as the two old Tas. banks did, though
there are not the same inducements for the
big trustee cos. to swallow smaller shows.

th£ VL f °r another ore body between
tins and the Junction mine.
Mt. Boppy, Canbelego (N.S.W!), for its
timi y f eai ‘ (dne) by amalgama-
tion from 61,111 tons, and 10,2330 z. were
also recovered from 66,457 tons sands and
slimes. Gold brought in £91,195, and sun-
x7?i e ?.oi nci ’ eased income to £91,506. But
£91,084 went in exes., leaving a profit of
only ±422. Shareholders were told in Lon-
don recently that “the low grade of the ore,
the practical exhaustion of such payable ore
as was known to remain in the mine,” con-
sidered in relation to present-day high costs,
bad "led the directors to the view that they
had exhausted the possibilities of Mt. Boppy
as a payable proposition under the circum-
stances now prevailing.” Hence manager
James Negus’s search for a new property.
The directors told shareholders that certain
negotiations were proceeding which might give
Boppy “a mine which had the elements of a
valuable property.” No doubt, the reference
was to Occidental, over which Negus has se-
cured a four months’ option. He also had a
look at the Christmas Gift, Cootamundra, and
is said to have been impressed. Some of the
Gift people were inclined to open negotiations
on the basis of their co. receiving £52,500 in
shares in a co. which would provide plant
and £50,000 for working capital; but the
majority of the Gift Board didn’t want to let
else in, and there was no offer.
After £5200 had been spent on preliminary
development, which had been “honestly car-
ried out,” according to E. W. Bonwick, about
18 months ago the Clark-Wesley co. was
formed to take over the old Gundagai Big
Reef and develop and equip it in accordance
with Bonwick’s recommendations. But the
co. did not find sufficient funds to carry out
the programme, and the show has not yet
been given the chance to show its worth. ‘ A
10-head battery was erected, but owing to
water shortage only 5-head were run for 127
hours, treating 50 of the 600 tons at grass.
The close of last year was one of the driest
on record at Gundagai, and the old busted
boiler on the bank of the small dam from
which supplies were being drawn was suffi-
cient warning to manager W. H. Wesley to
take no risk with the fluid available. The
water trouble is, however, being overcome:
the cash has been found to proceed with the
original scheme to; connect up with the big
dam (12 million gal. capacity) which was
constructed by an English co. in the ’seven-
ties. The 50 tons put through to see how
battery tests compared with assay results
gave 230 z. from boxes and plates, 3 tons
mixed concentrates and middlings going 6oz.
and tailings 2dwt. Allowing for the absorp-
tion by the new plates the average works out
at 16.Sdwt. per ton, and the recovery 88.69
p.c. However, even with the 10-head going
at full capacity on ore available, and the
proceeds going into development, the Clark-
Wesley will not get its chance unless further
funds are forthcoming. It is a big forma-
tion, necessitating considerable development.
Manager Wesley estimates that he has 15,000
tons going 14dwt. ready for stoping; but the
future depends on getting down and ascer-
taining if the big tonnages are there to war-
rant treatment on a large scale that Bonwick
talked of. #
Old Gundagai Long Tunnel (N.S.W.),
which gave some remarkable yields (3500 z.
from 3001 b. stone was one) in bygone years,
still fails to give any riches to the co. which
revived the show about four years ago. Hav-
ing sunk the main shaft to 400 ft. efforts
were made to locate the rich shoot which had
been encountered from the surface down to
200 ft.: but though driving practically en-
circled the shaft nothing of much consequence
showed up. Two years ago there was a
flutter on the part of optimists, but the mar-
ket was knocked flat by adverse reports;
geologist L. I. Harper gave a poor opinion
ol the show and declared that the future
apparently depended on the size and fre-
quency of occurrence of rich makes.” This
is the way things have gone: 1919. 14600 z.
fioin 140 l tons; 1920, 8670 z. from 1370 tons
curing the period ended September 30, £8222
was spent to get £5470 gold. However, the
co. is still holding on in the hope of something

neid (..N.S.W.), has been converted into a co.
Owmg no doubt, to the stiff Ma State stamp
dut : v , l a? lT at has been engineered from Pea-
cock s Melbourne office. It is a genuine go : all
the cash contributed, except about £3O for regis-
tiation costs, will be spent underground ; sur-
nnonc* £°^ ce ex e s - are to be paid in shares,
Iu.UUO ot ss. each being earmarked for the
purpose. For the 50 acres and rights 40,000
fully-paids are to be allotted ; the syndicate
accepts 100,000 contribs. paid to Is. for the
£lol)0 it has spent; and 50,000 shares have
been offered and nearly all taken up. Luck-
how Pups is seeking to the south-east of the
old field a repetition of the rich veins which
half-a-century ago made Lucknow one of the
greatest gold-producers in the world for its
size. An adjoining syndicate, the South Luck-
now, has proved 1600 ft. of virgin Lucknow
joint, and of that about 1000 ft. is in the Pups
ground. The South Lucknow is still in the
syndicate stage, but will probably also be
turned over to a co. shortly. Work in that
show has reached a very interesting stage: a
winze is going down where a spur joins the
contact, and 21dwt. values have already been
met, with arsenical pyrites becoming richer as
greater depth is reached.

The reported discovery of oil in four shal-
low bores near Ravensbourne, Blackall
IQ.), produced a rush for surrounding land.
If the Government analyst’s report confirms
the presence of crude oil in the samples
taken, it will add another link to the already
strong chain of evidence that oil occurs in
the Jurassic beds between Lohgreach and
Roma. The new find is about 45 to 50
miles from Springleigh, where the bore pro-
vides evidence of oil, both inspissated and
liquid, between depths of 3000 ft. and 6500 ft.
Springleigh bore is the deepest in Queens-
land, and is considered, on account of the
depth of artesian supplies there, to be some-
where near the centre of the basin. It,
therefore, looks as if the Ravensbourne find,
if it is confirmed, is either a seepage from
the lower oil beds, or an oil series much
higher than that passed through by the
Springleigh bore. The marine fossils met
with at 50ft. will probably be of importance
in fixing the geblogical horizon, and may be
expected to be cretaceous. The find looks
like a promising indication in a probable
area, but extensive boring may be needed
to define the local rock structure before pools
are found. Texas (U.S.A.) was lucky
enough to provide several shallow pools be-
tween 150 ft. and 400 ft., but that was some-
thing out of the box, and Blackall can hardly
expect similar luck. The Minister for Mines
has decided to have an investigation made
of the locality and of the samples from the
bore.

The oil fever has reached North Queens-
land, and as a result of scums and supposed
petrol smells oil-prospecting areas have been
taken up on the Mitchell River and near
Mount Molloy. The oil expert sent by the
Government squelched the hopes of several
budding promoters; the area taken up con-
sisted of old folded metamorphic rocks,
which anybody knowing the A B C of oil
occurrences would have turned down.

Although 30 to 40 men have been put on
at the Trekelano mine, that does not mean
that the copper situation is any easier at
Cloncurry (Q.). Only development work is
being done, with the stacking of high-
grade ore at the surface, so that the Hamp-
den co. can jump off early when production
costs permit. The best news for the district
is that W. H. Corbould, of Mount Elliott,
has been able to induce British and French
shareholders to fork out £300,000, with a
proviso as to building a railway. This means
that Mount Oxide is to be worked. While
the boom was on the Government promised
to connect it up to the railway system, but
it was one of the things that did not eventu-
ate. This has meant stagnation to Mount
Oxide, which has copper reserves second to
none in the Cloncurry district. Mines Minis-
ter Jones is now endeavoring to convene a
conference with the big copper cos. to see
liow production can be resumed. His trump
card is that the cos. can save £6 per ton
copper by using Bowen fuel when available,
Corbould is looking for a way out by leach-
ing, and thus practically dispensing with
fuel for the smelters. The cos. are anxious
to get going, but they want an adjustment
of wages in line with the reduced value of
copper, and also a cut in freights.
When the Styx coalfield (Q.) was first
opened up it was found to be in a badly-
faulted area, and a move was made a mile
away, where further extensive boring was
done and where about five seams of work-
able thickness were struck. Then the State
colliery was opened, and a fine 7ft. seam
has been worked recently at a depth of 100 ft.
The coal is about the highest quality dug
anywhere in the northern State—water, 1.7
p.c.; volatiles, 27.8; fixed carbon, 02.8; ash,
7.7. It is now reported, however, that the
old trouble has been met with in the present
workings, and that the seam is so badly
faulted that a move may have to be made
again. One consoling feature is that the
work has cost the taxpayer little, as the coal
mined has found a ready market at 18s. to
20s. a ton, and has covered a big proportion
of the outlay. On the other hand it will be
expensive to prove unfaulted portions of the
held by boring, owing to the lack of surface
outcrops. It will be unfortunate for Queens-
land if the field, which was expected to have
reserves running into tens of million tons of
fine coking and steam coal right on the rail-
way and close to deep water for shipping
cannot be economically exploited. One point
which is most significant is that while it is
geologically the youngest bituminous coal
(of Cretaceous age) worked in Australia it
is much lower in volatiles than the very
much older coals of Newcastle and Mait-
land, a feature which is practically certain
to mean disturbance by faulting or intrusions
of igneous rocks, since there are other coal
areas near, of older age, with double the
amount of volatile matter.
The other day a deputation from Edna May
Central, Westonia (W.A.), headed by cha r-
man Snowball, asked Minister for Mines Jack
ad ™ to guarantee a bank overdraft for
±lB,OOO. You have a better chance of being
struck by lightning than you have of getting
that, was Scaddan’s blunt refusal. “The
last time the Government helped the co. it
declared a Is. div. only a month prior to ap-
plying for assistance,” he added. Snowball
pleaded that unless the deputation’s request
was granted the Westonia field would be done.
But Scaddan was obdurate. Still, he stated
that a Government scheme for assisting the
Edna May group was being prepared and that
details would be announced later.

Westralian Mines Dept, has agreed, sub-
ject to a favorable report on prospects, to
financially assist Golden Butterfly,to sink
to 300 ft. Since crushing was started early
last year about 4500 tons have been treated
by the mill for an estimated return of
£lO,OOO-odd. In addition calls, if fully met,
should have brought in £BOOO. So why
should tiie co. need assistance? The ex-
planation probably is that the show belongs
to a class, common throughout Westralia,
that lasts as long as shareholders pay calls
but quickly succumbs when they stop.
Having consolidated its interests in the
Ivimberleys and Nor’-West, Australian Petro-
leum Development Co. is sending J. L.
Strevens to London for the purpose of
arranging survey and other work on its
areas by a British oil group. Meantime
trial boring will proceed in the Strevens
area, where coal has recently been discov-
ered, and prospecting will continue on the
Carnarvon and Wyndham properties. Ar-
rangements for the flotation of a large
Anglo-Australian co. to commence oil-boring
on the areas by next winter are in hand.

Freney Oil Co. (W.A.) had a statutory
roll-up in Perth recently, and chairman hi
J. Nicholson announced that cash resources
amounted to £13,255. CMls should increase
this to £36,000 by April) Other things men-
tioned were that directors’ fees had been
fixed at £l5O a year each, that a further
bore put down on Price’s Creek section had
given additional evidence of the presence
mineral oil, and that two plants capable
of boring to a depth of 4000 ft. had been
purchased.

Star Exploration, an English co. which is
still interested in Westralian mining, got
£1874 from divs., interest., etc., for the year
ended. Sept. 30 last; but after paying admin-
istration and other expenses, and providing
for loss on sale of certain investments, there
was a deficit of £l3B.

Mt. Monger Scotia has decided to wind up
and distribute the £6OO-odd that is left. The
Scotia was one of the cos. lured to Mt.
Monger (W.A.) during the 1920 boom, and
obtained, after a great scramble, an option
over a scrub-covered flat near the Lass o’"
Gowrie which was valued by the owners at
several thousands. A Bulletin man
tried and failed to find payable gold on the
piopeitj, and the eo. s experience was no
better.

Asbestos finds which are said to be worth
while have lately been made inland from
Koebourne (W.A.). Isolated hills are re-
ported to contain asbestos veins up to 30in.
wide, and show fibre up to 4in. long. A
Government expert has declared that they
can be profitably worked. Melbourne and
Sydney may be invited to provide capital.

/vP r ; Kelly, R.C. Bishop of Geraldton
(W.A.), is dead at 66. As a young priest
in Perth, his native city, he exhibited a bent
for journalism and was placed in charge of

administered the largest diocese in the Com-
lrom the fact that bis brother
who predeceased him. was a Liberal
ague official an impression grew up that
Lishop was of the same way of think-
* ut the scholarly and industrious old
pi elate never made a parade of his political
views, whatever they were.
Hughes takes no risks with the super-
natural. Nothing under Heaven would in-
duce lam to appoint 13 Ministers, and yet
tue loth man on his list of favorites could

»accd both ways with dire consequences. If

A Wentworth prophet were ex-
cluded, Australia’s political saviour could
claim no direct association with Armaged-
don in 1934, and, besides, might miss an
introduction to the Messiah. So he again
compromised. He formed a Cabinet of 12
aad attached Marks as Parliamentary
Under-Secretary with a chance of attending
Ministerial meetings when one of the 12
is sick.
Harold Harper, a fine young Digger-
pastorallst who served for the duration with
the. 10th Light Horse and came back a
major, has gone to join his mates who sleep
ln 1 alestme and the Peninsula. A storm
whirled away a small sailing craft in which he
was shipping wool to Onslow from his West-
ralian station; the
bales were washed
ashore, but nothin#
was found of
Harper and his

the only son of

“Nutty” James.
J. J. GARVAN,
managing director
of the Mutual
Life and Citizens ’
and chairman of
the Federal Com-
mission on the
unifying of Aus-
tralian railway
gauges.
Frank Moulden, who gets a New Year’s
knighthood for his.two years’ mayoralty of
Adelaide and his entertainment of the
Prince, is one of the junior members of one
of Adelaide’s oldest law firms, founded by his
grandfather, J. Elclin Moulden. The sons
of the founder, Beaumont and Bayfield, are
elderly now, and are reinforced by tlieir
sons, Frank and Arnold. Frank was a
bachelor till, four or five years back, he
married the widow of Winthrop Hackett of
Perth; and probably there has never been
a more energetic mayoress.
George Herbert Pike, converted last week
into Justice Pike —he is to be Judge of the
new Land and Valuation Court established
in N.S.W. —has been pursuing Costs in Syd-
ney for 30 years, and doing it with excep-
tional success. His salary will be £2500,
and he has probably made much more of
late years, for his were cases in which fees
are fat and refreshers copious. Still, £5O
a week with no competition and a pension
at the end is a nice enough thing these days.
Pike comes of a Tasmanian family, and was
a brilliant student at Sydney ’Varsity in
Arts and Law. Concentrating upon land
and taxation, he quickly came to the front
at the Bar, and in almost every big cause
regarding these matters heard of late years
in Sydney either Shand, K.C., or Campbell,
K.C., has informed s’onah that his learned
friend Pike was with him. If Shand had
Pike, Campbell had Alec Thomson, or vice
versa. Twenty years ago he was the best-
known of Land Court barristers; he was
against the Crown for the selectors in the
famous Mercadool dummying cases—they
were the days when B. R. Wise was in his
prime. Pike is a short, dark, healthy-looking
chap, well on the other side of 50. One of
his brothers, a doctor, was a conspicuous
figure at Oxford. Another brother, Fred, is
chief clerk in the N.S.W. Railway Construc-
tion Branch ; and a third, H.M.L., is a sur-
veyor.
There are two acousticons now in the
Federal Ministry. Hughes, of course, is
helpless without his artificial aid to hear-
ing, and Walter Marks has had to take to
one during the last year or two.
Henry Stead’s widow cables from Maori-
land that her husband didn’t die of cancer,
as reported, and that he hadn’t been seek-
ing medical aid abroad. Apropos this dis-
clajmer, or whatever it is—and, of course,
The Bulletin accepts it without reserve—
why is it that if a man dies of (say) pneu-
monia the fact is recorded without hesita-
tion, whereas if he dies of cancer, then three
times out of four a p.s. is attached to the
friend’s note—‘‘He died of cancer; but please
don’t mention that ”?
Undaunted by the handicap of blindness
Dudley Tregent, formerly a Vic. Lands Dept,
clerk, on returning froin the war took up the
study of law, and has passed his first year.
He had a leave warrant in his pocket when
the stray shot from a German gun got him
and deprived him of his sight on the day of
the Armistice. The Pommy nurse he mar-
ried is a treasure, and it won’t be her fault
if he does not turn out another Maxwell at
the Bar when he qualifies for admission.
Simpson Newland, of Adelaide, who gets
a tardy C.M.G., is an old man now. His
father, farmer and preacher, was one of
the pioneers of the Encounter Bay district
at the mouth of the Murray, and Simpson
has preserved the memories of very early
days in “Paving the Way.” He was Trea-
surer of S.A. long ago under John Downer,
but has lived very quietly of late, his old
age saddened by the death of two sons, Phil,
a lawyer-athlete, who was an international
wicket-keeper, .and Clive, a doctor, who was
killed in a motor smash. The eldest son of
a large family is one of Adelaide’s leading
surgeons.
W. M. Hughes’s wife has been made a
Dame of the British Empire. She has earned
it.
When the Irish ouestion is dropped and
the mining divisions of Dampier are trans-
ferred to Ivalgoorlie, George Foley’s hold on
the seat will be precarious. The reporters
will miss him when he goes, for he has
talked louder, lunger and with less provoca-
tion than any newcomer in the House of
Reps, for years. Since “Texas” Green was
narrowly defeated at the State elections he
has been nursing Ivalgoorlie for Labor. Per-
sonally popular and boundlessly energetic,
Green only needs to shed some of his im-
practicable red-rag notions to become a use-
ful M.H.R.
Adaptable Alec Peacock, Vic. Minister of
Education, is serving in his tenth Cabinet.
His tally of office to date (Jan. 5) is 16
years 4 months 10 days. Beginning as an
honorary Minister jc Mrmro’s team on Guy
Fawkes Day, 1800, he has had turns with
Shieis, Turner (2). Bent, Watt (2), and
Lawson, besides being at the head of two
Governments. His friends challenge any
living Australian politician to show a better
aggregate Ministerial office score. He will
be 33 years an Assembly member if he lives
till _ March 28. No amount of persuading
is likely to induce him now to desert State
for Federal politics. He tried for Sargood ? s
Senate seat 10 years ago, but has resisted
all other, temptations.
About an Unusual Business man :
George Crowley, of Sydney City Mutual, has just
given his name to the property opposite the Supreme
Court which for 40-odd years was called Darley
Chambers. In the ’nineties he had a row with Chief
Justice Darley and then, promised the scandalised
dignitary that his name should come down from a
block of buildings which it defiled, or words to that
effect. And now, his society having bought the
premises, the improbable has duly occurred. But
Crowley is always shocking the conventions of the little
world in which he lives and gets so much fun out
oi. At the outbreak of the late war the insurance
offices were circularising each other for £6OO to buy
a motor-lorry for use in France. No one seemed to
know who had started the lunacy, but when the
circular reached the City Mutual the manager said:
“I’ll give a cheque for five lorries—provided you
can show me they are needed.” Inquiries in official
quarters then disclosed that there were hundreds of
unwanted vehicles of the sort already in Flanders.
At present he is disturbing matters by urging the
B.M.A. to raise the fees for examination of life
cases. He urges that nothing stands between the
life office and the payment of thousands of pounds
sterling but the carefulness of the medical examiner,
and that in the case of, say, a £5OOO proposal a
fee of 25 or even 50 guineas would be more in
keeping than the miserable guinea or so which is
now allowed. But so far the profession has stead-
fastly refrained from biting.
William Slee, superintendent of the con-
centrating plant at Wallaroo (S.A.), is dead
at 58. An expert in the treatment of ores,
he was formerly mill superintendent at the
Broken Hill Junction, and later, when the
Hancock jigs were introduced into the U.S.A.,
had som,e years there installing plant and
seeing that it had a fair run.
Robert Stout, C.J. of Maoriland, while
passing through Melbourne on his way back
from the Cold Land to Wellington, related
how he was captivated by the simplicity of
the procedure of the judicial committee of
the Privy Council with which he sat as a
member. He gloried in the absence of
Bench millinery. S’onor has not weakened
on his faith in Cold Tea. Vic. politicians
cherish a yarn told by Jock Mclntyre, Pat-
tersons convivial Minister for Lands, that
when he went to M.L. he called on Stout,
then a politician. At the end of three-
quarters of an hour Jock’s throat was so
parched that, taking a hasty farewell, he
tell on the neck of the messenger at the door
and begged to be shown the way to the
nearest pub.
, Wh<m Dooley was making his hurried re-
s uffle, the portfolio of Labor was taken
rroin iUcLirr and given to Kavanagh, who
had previously received his £1945 p.a. aii

tion of syphilis.
And there is no

it. But a rich

always amuse him-
self somehow.
Justice DUFFY ,
of the High Court.
Fral Johns, of Adelaide, author of “Who’s
V\ ho m the Commonwealth,” is putting
through the press shortly an entirely new
biographical work, “Australasian Celebrities
and Pioneers,” which deals mostly with the
dead.. One must have been, or, if he is liv-
ing, has to be, somebody of importance to be
included in this book. Mere politicians and
.other Meeting “notabilities” have no chance
of a place.
“Y.Z.”: The late Henry Stead had a
Herman education, and at the outbreak of
the war possessed a tremendous faith in
Herman power. He predicted the war’s end
with absolute confidence, and listened to
any contentions to the contrary with an
amused toleration. He could never escape
from the Prussian school in which he was
so sedulously instructed, and therein was a
standing object-lesson on the folly of one
nation handing to another the work of shap-
ing the minds of its young.
“Copabella” : Young A. J. Eoffey, who has
become dux of Geelong College, one of Vic.’s
Great Public Schools, is the son of a wharf-
laborer. In one year he won four scholar-
ships at a State primary school, and chose
that of Geelong Col. as the. least likely to
overtax his father’s pocket. He has kept
at the head of his class throughout his school
career and should next go on to the ’Varsity,
but dad doubts if he can finance it. Others
of the Roffeys, boy and girl, won scholar-
ships to public schools, but stood down in
order to let A.J. have his chance, the family
funds being insufficient to see more than one
through.
Mick Collins, one of the financiers of the
Vic. Labor party, is back in Melbourne City
Council again. He scot a walk-over when the
hiatus occurred in Hopetoun Ward owing to
B. B. Deveney being made an alderman upon
the death of J. H. Gardiner. Collins re-
cently sold the Lveion Hotel, opposite his
shrine, the Trades Hall, for a big sum.
“Vickay”: The “Australian Schoolboy” of
Zora Cross’s “Elegy” (B. 22/12/’2l) was
her brother Jack, who went west in France.
He was one of the good, too-young Austra-
lians who believed that the business of cag-
ing the Kaiser was urgent and serious
enough to demand their immediate aid, and
he joined up in 1916 while a pupil at the
Sydney High School and still under 18. At
the end he was carrying a platoon-sergeant’s
roll-book in his tunic pocket.
The Gov.-General of Maoriland was not
the first of his name to come to Australasia.
In 1823 Henry Jellicoe arrived in Van Die-
men’s Land as a settler and started farming
at_ Campbelltown. As he came from Hamp-
shire, where his father was a magistrate, he
may have been some sort of kin to his more
famous little namesake.
A lady’s contribution :
I often wonder what Charles Jardine Don, Austra-
lia’s first Labor member, would think of some of
his successors could he revisit the glimpses of the
moon. A Chartist in his youth, he sat in two Vic-
torian Parliaments as M.L.A. for Collingwood. He
used to work at his trade (he was a stonemason)
all day and sit in the House at night. Thirteen
shillings a day was all Don got. Still he was better off
than men of the 40th Regiment alongside whom he
toiled at the Victoria Barracks, who were paid ss.
a day besides their Imperial allowance of Is. and a
“colonial” grant of 2s. Don died in 1867.
TWENTY-TWO!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down the track we see her coming—
Twenty-two!
At her back a joyful humming—
Twenty-two!
And we wonder what she’ll bring us,
What the gifts her hand will fling us,
What the songs her voice will sing us—
Twenty-two!
Will she cheat us like the others—
Twenty-two ?
How they mocked us and our brothers,
Twenty-two!
Came along with Spring-time dances
And with violet-sweet advances—
What a thing a dead romance is,
Twenty-two!
Ask we but you’ll treat us fairly,
Twenty-two!
Just a chance to go on squarely,
Twenty-two!
If the skies are grey-enfolden
In the morn, let noon embolden
Till the sun bursts glory-golden—
Twenty-two!
Harking back would make us fretful,
Twenty-two !
Truer wisdom comes forgetful,
Twenty-two !
If you cannot lead where bliss is
In so sad a world as this is,
Let us have at least your kisses,
Twenty-two!
Kisses that would linger sweetly,
Twenty-two!
Hounding off our days completely,
Twenty-two!
So that surely we remember
In the dusk of next December
There is perfume in the ember —
Twenty-two!
QUEENSLAND.

SOCIETY
, Tal k ing about strange jobs that
tall to the medico. A queer one came to a
mend of mine, who introduced me to it as
a consultant and participator. A lady of fair
to middling social prominence, whose past
had a slightly purple tinge at the edges, had
at last decided to settle down, and, a bride-
groom having been captured, all was in readi-
ness for the ceremony. All, that is, except
one little thing. About four years before
she had contracted a liaison with a gentle-
man who had since vanished, but had left
behind him on the fair white skin of the lady
a trifling souvenir in the form of his initials
and hers inside a heart delicately tattooed —
very delicately as to design and location. The
prospective bride argued, with some degree
of logic, that its discovery sooner or later
was inevitable, so she sought medical advice
CONFIDENCES.
“I’ll never tell her another thing in confi-
dence!”
“Why, did she let it out?”
“No, the cat: she know what I told her for
and she didn’t.”
as to the chances of having the damning ob-
ject removed. As it wanted only six weeks
to the wedding we told her we’d do our best,
but the probabilities were that a scar or
blemish of some kind would be left. She
decided that this could be easily explained
away as a burn or something should the need
arise, and grimly told us to go ahead. Two
days before the wedding the last pie“” of
skin, blackened and detached by nitrate,
peeled off, leaving a white surface that bore
no traces of tattooing. She sent us each an
an invitation to the ceremony, and I grin
still when I recall the surreptitious wink she
gave us at the banquet that follow-ed while
the officiating clergyman was expatiating on
her many virtues, he having known her since
her childhood.

“Exul” on the queer tricks of death: —
“McNorth’s” par (B. 8/12/’2l) on the gentle
habit of certain natives of slaying their enemies
by scratching them with a
spear that has been allowed
to remain some days in a
corpse, reminds me that Pas-
teur was probably the first to
elucidate the cause of such
deaths. He found that blood
taken from a sheep imme-
diately after its death from
anthrax did not produce an-
thrax and death when in-
jected into another sheep
that has been protected by
his anti-anthrax vaccine. But
if the blood were taken
several hours after death, the
injected animals invariably
died, but with symptoms not
resembling those of anthrax.
Further investigation showed
that death was due to an
acute septicaemia of strepto-
coccal origin, caused by the
invasion of the first animal’s
body, postmortem, by viru-
lent streptococci, probably
from the bowels, which were
transferred by the injection
to the other animal. But I
doubt “McNorth’s” assertion
that death ensued within an
hour. 1 should think that
the earliest limit would be
nearer 24 hours. And walk-
ing the patient about, even
if it were possible with one
so sick, would do far more
harm than good, and would
certainly not “prevent co-
agulation” if it tended to
occur. The heavily-manured
soil of France during the late war also caused
deaths from septicaemia and toxaemia after very
trivial injuries. One young doctor died within 24
hours of getting a scratch on his thigh that he
didn’t even think necessary to put a field-dressing on.
•* » * #
“Morob” : Fate can be a grim joker. In
Cooktown (N.Q.) Binks, an ore-buyer, who
was hiding from a wife in the South, con-
spired with a printer-friend to fake an
account of his death, describing how some
cargo had fallen on his head from the slings
of a vessel upon whose deck he had been
standing and killed him instantly. Binks
himself wrote the yarn, which was printed
on the back of a proof-sheet, and when the
edges had been trimmed down there was
nothing to tell that it hadn’t come from a
newspaper. The clipping was sent to an-
other friend in Sydney with instructions to
bring it under the notice of Mrs. Binks.
That lady accepted it as genuine, ceased her
hunt for the missing non-supporter, and for
about ; five years regarded herself as a widow,
while Binks went carefree about his affairs
in different parts of the North. Then one
day business took him by steamer from
Cairns to Cooktown, and as the vessel was
going alongside the jetty he stood, bag in
hand, on the foreward deck directly under-
neath a cargo-boom which was being got
ready to discharge freight. There was a
crack, about six tons of wood and iron
came down with a crash, and —Binks was
properly dead in the place and manner he
had arranged his faked ending five years
previously.,

“Hanno” : In the medical records of the
A.I.F. there is only one case of a man having
been discharged by a medical board for
“fear,” open and undisguised, although sev-
eral were sent back for secondary causes
induced by blue funk in action, such as
neurasthenia or “nervous collapse.” The
Billjim in question was in one of the rein-
forcements, and the mere thought of going
into action used to make him violently ill.
Eventually it was decided to board him. and
whoever wvas in charge of the proceedings,
being a stickler for accuracy, had his com-
plaint put down as “fear,” with the result
that he appears under that heading in the
official records. Strangely enough, right up
till his arrival in France there was no hint
of the man’s affliction, which did not devebn
until he was actually in the line. In any
other army he would have stood a good
chance of being shot, and it speaks volumes
for the A.I.F. medical heads that they re-
sisted the introduction of the death-penalty
in the way they did, their objection being
founded on just such cases as this one,

“Maram”: .There is some talk of Mel-
bourne Gaol being pulled down, and if this
is done the most ghost-ridden spot in the
Commonwealth will disappear—the small
cemetery where the body of every man exe-
cuted in the gaol since it was built has
been buried. It is an oblong, gloomy yard.
surrounded by towering walls, and is entered
by a small iron gate let into masonry at
one end. Smooth asphalt covers the yard,
and irregular rows of roughly-cut initials
and dates—nearly one hundred in all—
chipped in the stones of the wall about a
foot from the ground are all there is to
indicate the poor wretches who have been
laid below, “wrapped in their winding sheets
of flame.” Victoria is the only State in
the Commonwealth, and one of three or four

crime or for being born mentally deficient.
If there is anything in the theory of psy-
chical research students that malignant
spirits, such as those belonging to executed
criminals, linger around the place where their
bodies were buried, in the hope of being able
to harm somebody by way of revenge, then
that particular graveyard must be the most
unsafe spot in Australia at about midnight.
* * * *
“S.S.S.” : Recently a country rector’s wife
told me the story with much solemnity. A little
girl had died out on a station, and the parents
brought the body in and laid it in the church
until burial. A few hours after the funeral
the mother, accom-
panied Joy the rec-
tor’s wife and her
four-year-old daugh-
ter, went into the
church. Immedi-
ately the youngster
broke away and ran
up the aisle laugh-
ing and calling out,
“Oh, Mummie,
Mummie, look !
Pretty little girl
with flowers in her
hair!” And then
she commenced to
run about and play
with someone un-
seen by the others.
She kissed the in-
visible little play-
mate, and cried bit-
terly when her
mother drew her
away. What is to be made of that?

“Lex” states a ease:—
Suppose a woman was lying in agony under a
capsized motor-car, and the local expert in the hand-
ling of a jack said he was too tired to come along
and use the implement. What would be said of
him in the event of the woman dying? Suppose,
further, that no other person skilled with a jack
was allowed to assist for fear of being boycotted by
the Jack-users’ Union. What would the public
have to say, in that case, of the Jack-users’ Union?
These queries are put apropos of a Christmas-week.
happening in Sydney. Mrs. Brown (say) was in
agony with appendicitis. She called in Dr. (also,
s£ >3' —though it wasn’t) Smith, who administered
morphia. Towards evening the pains began again;
by eight they were excruciating, and the doctor
was sent for once more. His answer was that he
“felt too tired to go out again.” The family tried
another doctor—a personal friend. He was sorry,
but the rules of the B.M.A. forbade him to interfere
without the other man’s personal consent. At 5
a.m. the woman died. This cast-ilon rule for-
bidding one doctor to have anything to do with the
patient of another appears in the B.M.A. lexicon
under the heading, “Medical Ethics.” But it is
no more ethical, in origin, principle or fact, than
the basic rule of moneylending or bookmaking. It is a
device to establish a monopoly for profit—a mon-
opoly which is supported by the boycott, and which,
as in the case above quoted, may have fatal effects.
Let the B.M.A. make all the rules it likes to keep
the profession respected; but when it comes to
one of its ukases condemning people to horrible
deaths for fear a medical dog may occasionally have
to share his manger with another, then the answer
of Parliament ought to be that all the parties to
any such arrangement are guilty of a criminal con-
spiracy.

“Mr. Ocky”: One of the generous Eng-
lishmen who used to throw their homes open
to Aussies in Blighty blended a spirit of
hospitality with a strange delight in frighten-
ing the wits out of his guests. I was among
his victims at the fine old mansion in
Essex. One of the best rooms was “haunted,”
but the old chap generally prevailed upon a
sceptical guest to spend a night in it. Being
a brave soldier he dare not refuse. All night
long could be heard the unmistakable sound
of somebody walking about the room in ill-
fitting slippers, and if ever a man believed
in Conan Doyle it was then. In the morn-
ing the host eagerly questioned the guest and
compared his experiences with those of
earlier occupants, including himself, for he
confessed to having had a night of terror
in the room. He told me several workmen
had failed to find the hiding-place of the
spook, and when the war was over he in-
tended to pull the walls down.
* * * *
Mee Bobbie’: I take off my hat to an
old native-woman neighbor of mine on
Guadalcanal’ (Solomons). She and her
daughter were washing themselves on the
river bank recently, when an alligator about
Bft. long grabbed the daughter and made for
deep water. The old mother caught, the
girl by the arm and hung on, yelling for
help, while the alligator was lashing with
his tail and gaining deeper water every second.
At last some of the men came up with spears
and the alligator let go, but not before he
had torn the young woman’s breast nearly
off, broken her arm and lacerated her side
badly. That old Kanaka mother had the
courage and the hanging-on spirit of a bull-
dog-ant, and it is a joy to be able to add
that she saved her girl’s life.
“Howitzer”: I met Joan of Arc’s sister
in Armentieres. There were farmhouses
adjacent to our support trenches, and many
of the peasants refused to quit, as the shoot-
ing rarely hurt them. One night, however,
Fritz raided us and plastered the back area
with shells. I was in a support trench dur-
ing the bombardment, when I saw a woman
running through the hellish barrage. I won-
dered if I was right in the head. Then a
pretty French girl of 19 or so dropped at
my side in the trench, and in broken English
SO DIFFERENT.
“You have a comfortable income ?”
“Large, but not comfortable. My wife knows
exactly how much it is.”
begged for a rifle to fill the Hun with lead.
She stayed with us till next morning, and
her joy was great when she found the fire
had left some of the old house standing.
The curious part was that though her old
mother had been killed early in the shelling
she hadn't mentioned it to us—in her agony
otilv a desire to hit back had a place in her
mind.

RETROSPECT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The New Year had sharp little flying rhymes
That ran far back to kiss dead times
And dimpled out between the chimes
Of the bells that rang on the river.
Ding, dong, bell! It was yesterday
That I was a heedless boy at play
And time was singing, as s all times may,
M ith a hundred years in his quiver.
New Year is Over and gone to sleep.
The pale regrets that he tried to reap
Nod in the paddock where old black sheep
Can eat the weeds with the clover.
The thoughts that came and the thoughts that flew
From my window of dreams at the sight of you
Can keep till December ’22—
Yes, the New Year is pleasantly over.

f 1 ile Proper emblem of Australia is the waratah
and not the wattle. The wattle belongs to South
Africa just as much as here, while other lands
beside have their native examples of the mimosa.
But only one land boasts the waratah, and that is
Our Land. The waratah should be carved on the
prow of every ship of ours, on the end of every flag-
staff of ours, cast on the front of every engine of
ours. The wattle is a lady, the waratah is a
man; leave the lady the boudoir and let the man
go out and face the day and its heat.—M.G.j

“Solomon M.”: I think Christmas should
always fall on Sunday as it did this year, so
as to get both jobs over at once. And I
would like to arrange that Good Friday and
New Year should fall on Christmas Day.
Then if Christmas was shifted to the first
Tuesday in November I would be content.
“B N. J.”: During Gov. Nathan’s recent
tour through the Maranoa and Warrego dis-
tricts (Q) he made a short stay at a station
owned by two brothers, fine bushmen, but one
deaf and both rough as a woolpack. At dinner
one of the hosts proposed the health of their
guest, and in doing so remarked that the
grazier’s life was one long worry. He told
his Ex. about the dingo, then about the
prickly-pear, and was just starting on the
blowfly when the other brother, who, with
one hand clipped round his ear, had been
an interested listener, suddenly broke in
with a whisper that could just be heard at
the far side of the horse-paddock: “Don’t
forget to tell him about the ,
rabbits, Joe!”
MEN ARE SUCH BRUTES.
“I think it was horrid of him rescuing that
hussy. He’s never once rescued me.”
“But, my dear, he has never had occasion
to.”
“No, all men are brutes. He never lets me
go past the danger line.”
“Peter”: Many Melbourne people want to
know why Vic. Attorney-General Robinson
released the notorious Henry Stokes after
he had served only two months of a six
months’ sentence. For a long- time Stokes
had been a trouble to the police. As the
elusive commander of a two-up “joint” in
Richmond he hod become a public nuisance,
though he had won a lot of local sympathy
by emulating Wren in doling out “charity”
to an unprosperous neighborhood. But two-
upping was only a modest pink patch in
Stokes’s record. He also had the unplea-
sant habit of playing with artillery. * and
he received his six months last September
tor some ugly revolver practice at Fitzroy,
where there was a feeling that the public
would have been safer had he been retired
tor six years. But apparently this amazing
young man commands more influence than
tiis admirers had ever .suspected. Anyhow,
THE LITTLE THINGS THAT TELL.
FATHER: "My boy, it’s the little things of life that tell!”
SON: “Did mum have a little brother too?”
lie is at large on the understanding that
he will leave the country, which presumably
means that he is now at liberty to annoy
citizens in the adjoining States "if he, feels
so disposed. Nothing matters, apparently,
so long as he agrees to save the Vic. C.I.D.
from any further exertion. This is an affair
outside the power of the Federal authori-
ties ; but surely it is time the States at
one of their numerous conferences agreed
to drop this practice of releasing prisoners
on condition that they make themselves a
nuisance to some other State in future.
“D.F.” : No wonder they lived long in the
good old days. When the Medical Board of
N.S.W. held its first meeting on December
31, 183 S, there were only five names to be
placed on the register. N. S. Wales had
then 70,000 inhabitants; now, with less than
30 times as many people, it has 2239 regis-
tered medical practitioners, and last year
118 were added to the list .
* * * *
Moiob : Although the New Guinea native
is naturally a teetotaller, he has occasionallv
had a mighty jag—as, for instance, at
i arama, in the Daru district, in 1873. 'when
a Dutch ship, loaded mainly with arrack, was
wrecked close to the village. The nigs., after
murdering the crew, broached the cargo.
Finding that the sensation it
caused when drunk was plea-
sant, they commenced a glori-
ous spree. Some L.M.S. teach-
ers who were unfortunate
enough to arrive on the scene
were promptly killed, their
bodies eaten and their heads
stuck up on poles and displayed
as trophies. The jag lasted for
over three weeks, and the end
came then only because some of
the natives who went on board
the wreck for more arrack man-
aged to set fire to the vessel.
An explosion that followed
killed about 40 of them; and a
lot more were either shot or
hanged by a party that arrived
to look for the murderers of the missionaries.
One wav and another for quite a long time
mat village had the most unpleasant recol-
lections of its one great drunk.
“McNortli” : Fine old Papuan missionary
Chalmers was preaching at Suau, a very wild
place in those days, when a completely nude
native entered the little thatched church and
glared at the male portion of the congrega-
tion, which occunied one side of the building.
Presently his eye fell upon a youth who had
been looking very important in an old shirt
and nothing else. The stranger went to him
and attempted to tear off the garment. Chal-
mers stopped his sermon and investigated.
The nude man accused the youth of having-
stolen the shirt. He had, he said, been keep-
ing it for this Sunday in order to look nice
before the girls, and the youth had taken it.
The youth said the other fellow lied and
that the shirt was his. Then Chalmers
examined the garment and saw that i£ was
one of his own which he had given to the
nude man some time before. The abashed
youth promptly took it off and gave it to
its rightful owner, who at once donned it and
sat down where he would be most conspicu-
ous to the female portion of the congrega-
tion. And Chalmers went back to his desk
and proceeded with his sermon.
“Nitric”: Nothing that those damn capi-
talists can do is right. I had to overhaul a
large coastal vessel hung up in the Brisbane
River. In tire crew’s quarters I inspected
the bunks, which had lately been fitted with
wire mattresses. But, it, how could
a man lie on such things ! So they had cov-
ered the springs with boards. And do you
remember how they fought the soul-iess
owners for a bit of comfort?
“J.E.” finds himself in difficulties —
Where is the world supposed to go after it ends ?
Or will it just stay around dead, and go nowhere ?
The question should be worth raising at Wick and
Peterhead and Fraserburgh (Scotland). The fisher-
men up that way are a wet, pious, large-booted race,
with Celtic, Scandinavian and a little Saxon blood
in their veins, and they indulge in a revival now and
then. t It isn’t often, for they are in a fairly revived
state all the time. For no known reason they
lately began to see angels on the face of the deep,
so they decided that the end of the stolid, globular
old world was at hand. And they swore off whisky,
tobacco, cards, dice, chess, draughts (they were so
short of sins that they had to include chess and
draughts to make a real swearing-off), jokes and
other light conversation and work. They even took
to selling their boats and giving away the proceeds.
But so far as can be ascertained not one of them has
given even a hint as to where this hardy round
object of ours will go with no place to go to.
* * * *
'.Moresby”: With plague in A ustralia ex-
treme measures are being taken uy the
Papuan health authorities to keep the
scourge off. Moresby is over-run with rats,
and as an inducement to the natives to kill
them the Government is offering a stick of
trade tobacco for each rodent. One of B.P.’s
officials called his native labor staff together,
explained this, and told them to keep a sharp
lookout for rats. They held a mystified con-
fab. among themselves for a minute or two,
and the spokesman delivered the ver-
dict: “What’s matter? Guv’ment tink we
all same along pussy-cat?”
* * * *
“Grad”: Dr. Neil McQueen, principal of
Croydon (Sydney) Presbyterian Ladies’
College, concluded what S. M. Herald
called a scathing criticism of the secondary
system of education” with the following
One of the questions asked at the intermediate
examination was: “What were the military reforms
of Marius?’’ Well, Marius lived nearly 2000 years
ago, and who wanted to know what the military sys-
tem was then? What was the use of learning that
angles at the base of an isosceles triangle were equal?
They could see .that by looking at it.
While to be ignorant was ‘a sin, to cram a lot of
useless knowledge was a greater sin. Education
should be more practical, more frankly utilitarian,
and three of the main requisites were a knowledge of
food, clothing and shelter.
And then a colleague, amid holy laughter,
approvingly called the speaker ‘“a Divine
Bolshevist.” “Podsnap” would have been a
juster word. During the Eden case counsel
asked YY histler: “And do you ask 400
guineas for a tiny picture like that?” “No,”
said Whistler; “I ask it for the experience
of a lifetime.” Nothing was commoner
during the late war than to hear recruits
asking why they should be given physical
exercises. Nothing is commoner now than
to read of misguided members of Parliament
who inquire what object there can be in
teaching military cadets to form fours. The
higher mathematics are admittedly useless
for the ordinary purposes of life; a soldier
is not expected to bend briskly up and down
in the face of the enemy; fours are not
formed in action. But it is exercises of just
tins nature —exercises which any oaf can
ridicule but none is able to better—that
enable artists to paint. Judges to sift evi-
dence, mechanics to excel at their trades.
Of course, it is desirable that Australian
children should be taught about food, cloth-
ing and shelter. But if they are to be re-
lieved of the sterner mental discipline from
which their overseas rivals have not the
least chance of being exempted, then, while

“E.D.” : I am glad “E.” (8/12/’2lf
agrees with me that manners are in a
rapid decline. In his criticism of my sug-
gested method of retarding the decay, he
says lethal weapons are useless —it is better
to cultivate a philosophic spirit. But
a philosophic spirit in the presence of a
black eye is about as effective as a fairy
story in the presence of a rattlesnake. “To
meet the light man’s rapier the big rude
1,1 an, might carry a club or meataxe,” says
“E.” Here “E.” misses my point, I am
afraid. I was contending that the big rude
man already carried the club and the meat-
axe, and was never reluctant to employ both.
“F.H.” : He was big and burly and had
red whiskers and a bullock team and a wife.
He carried with him a gash on the forehead
and an odor of beer. “Yes,” he said, indicat-
ing the wound, “the missus done it. Hardly
spoke, I had, when she ups with the poker
and dents me ’end in. I’d ha’ bashed her, by
cripes, but she grabs the shotgun from the
corner. So I didn’t. I wasn’t going to be

his eyes crept a gleam of remorse. “So ’elp

Earnestly to sympathise
When she sees fond hearts go bang,
Knocked out by the boomerang
Of her roving eyes that fling

Proper persons all admit
Everything about her’s fit—
Arms and lips and nose and teeth,
Irises that dream beneath
Curling lashes that ensnare
Everybody, everywhere ;
Gleaming-to-be-kissed, white shoulders
That bewitch all young beholders,
And play havoc now and then
With the elder gentlemen.

Made to master her she’ll click,
Kiss and clip and bill and coo
Cordially as I or you.

“Colub”: New Guinea lias only a few
varieties of venomous snakes, the principal ones
being a black which closely resembles the Austra-
lian Pseudechis porphyriacus and a white-bellied
water-snake, but they make up in deadliness what
they lack otherwise. I think white-belly is the most
poisonous ophidian in the Pacific, and although its
venom is not as toxic as is that of the Indian Naja
tripudians or the American Crotalus horridus, it
can run either of those a pretty close second. Some
years ago, in the Morobe district, I saw a native
of about 19, and of exceptional physique, die within
90 minutes of being bitten, despite strychnine injec-
tions, cauterisation, etc. Incidentally, the sea-snake
seems to be completely amphibious, for I have killed
one a good three miles from the nearest sea-water,
and have seen four or five of them swimming together
eight miles out at sea.

“Bill It.”: When the horse-pulling records
have all been told, let me in with a yarn about
what bullocks can do. Nick Cowell, a Tantawanglo
(N.S.W.) bullocky, with an eight-ton load of wire
for Bombala, halted for refreshments at the Wol-
umba pub. He uncoupled all but his polers, and,
because the waggon stood on sloping ground, brake-
locked the four wheels. While Nick was talking to
his friend Hennessy indoors, the tongue bullocks
moved off, whereupon the polers bent to it and
shifted the dead weight behind them 20 yards up the
rise before they cried a go.
“Jim Carew”: “Tarago” (B. 15/12/’2l)
tells us to hang a bunch of elder-berry leaves in the
tent or meat-safe to keep blowflies away. He will
find fennel a better fly scarer, and it is far more
common than elder berry. A bunch of fennel hung
from the mattress under a bed will keep vermin at
a respectful distance, too.
*■***■
“Monaro”: Here are two samples of ob-
servation which would
be hard to beat. Hav-
ing inquiries for the
timber on 160 acres of
land, a Rooty Hill
(N.S.W.) land-owner
asked a local bushman
(you don’t have to go
West o’ Beyond for
bushmen) what he
thought about it. Sit-
ting on the verandah
the bushman consid-
ered that the area
would yield 1000 tons
of marketable timber,
including 180 tons of
a certain variety. On
that basis the owner
sold. The paddock re-
cently cut out 989
tons altogether, 176
being of the special
variety mentioned by
the bushman. One
pleasant Sunday morn-
ing I crossed a Gan-
main (N.S.W.) pad-
dock with a bullocky.
We yarned about
anything and every-
thing. Three months
later tenders were
called for clearing the
area, about 1000 acres.
On the strength of that
casual stroll he sub-
mitted a price, got
the job, and came out
of it just about as
he had expected to.
“Tumble Long’': “Rockdale” owes a couple
more apologies (B. 17/11/’2l) for not including
the peewit and the crow as nest-defenders. This
season I have been the recipient of numerous orders
from James Crow to clear out of the paddock,
accompanied by a peck; and it was only yesterday
morning that I received another contradiction to
“Rockdale’s” assertion from two peewits, who were
very emphatic about my immediate disappearance
from a clump of box where they had nested.
“E.S.M.” : Those Abos. who seem to have
had so much trouble keeping their prads tied lately
might take a tip from D. McGillivray. Get a fine
fishing-line or any light, strong string, tie a bowline
round the horse’s neck, then take a half-hitch
round his lower jaw under the tongue and tie to a
post about 6in. shorter than the bridle reins. He
might snap it the first time, but I will guarantee
that even sandflies won’t shift him the second time.
. .Iy. : Relative to the respective
merits of the 32.40 Winchester (B. 29/10/’2l) and
a shotgun with cut cartridges (B. 22/9/’2l) I
vote in favor of the 32.40. But for any shooter who
vishes to make money out of skins the ordinary 1892
Hodel 32 Winchester is almost ideal. The shotgun

ammunition; also all skins got that way, having
three or more shot-holes, are graded as second
quality. In the second place, though the 32.40 is a
very hard hitter the bullet from it must hit the
kangaroo in the right place or he will require a
second shot. Result, four boles and a second-grade
skin, as the fast 32.40 bullet almost always goes
right through. Now, the 32 will kill wherever the
32.40 will kill, at all ranges to 300yds. And the
bullet seldom goes clean through, so there is only
one hole in. the skin. The 44, mentioned by “Bendee”
,_(B. .39/10/’2l), is about on a par with the, 32, but
it hits slightly harder and often leaves two holes
in the skin. The charges required in reloading the

“W. Casey”: The Abo. who even men-
tions a reach of 6ft. 9in. must have lived among
pigmies. Jack Taylor, a native of the Braid-
wood district (N.S.W.), could, and I suppose still
can, form a connecting link between two posts Bft.
3in. apart.
* * * *
“Sierra”: Re fleas (B. 8/12/’2l). I once
interviewed a Dago flea-trainer .at his studio. He
explained that he recruited his artists direct from
his own blankets, and said that even in their un-
trained state they never offered to bite him. I
believe him, too. I wouldn’t bite him for 50 quid.
“Wilga” : Can any Abo.-ologist tell me the
name of the small fish which frequents the Western
(Q.) bore drains? It is from lin. to 4in. long and
resembles the ordinary fresh-water perch somewhat
in color. It seems to be most plentiful near the
bore-head, where the water is almost boiling, and
it can swim as fast against the stream as. with it.
A sudden change to the cooler water down-stream
kills it. How does it get in the drain in the first
place, and how is it the boiling water doesn’t kill it?
* * * *
“Veronal”: An early writer records that he
saw a cabbage, grown in a back yard at Liverpool
(N.S.W.), the stalk of which measured 54ft., and
the height from the ground to the uppermost flowers
was 13ft. The vegetable had produced three heads.
This beats John Chinaman hollow.
“Rustic”: Two mates and I, working out-
side- Ingham (N.Q.), had just finished feeding, and
were sitting back blowing clouds, when a grasshopper
about an inch long, of a pinkish-grey color, lobbed
on the meat-dish, and proceeded to mop up what
was left of the salt junk. We watched him for
about five minutes, and in that time he had got
outside of a piece of beef about as large as himself.
Is it a habit? And is the sort plentiful? If it is,
with salt junk at 6d. and a ride of 20 miles to get
it, we’re going to invest in a steel safe.
“Ida D.” (Pilcanyen, Patagonia) : Some
time ago I wrote of a new vizcacha (chinchilla)
found on this camp. We have now discovered that
this animal has no kidney! When killed it begins
at once to “go bad,” and green spots appear within
a few hours. Careful examination fails to reveal a
trace of the organ or any substitute. Is it unique?
"Jobber”: The experience of “Snell’s”
mate (B. 8/12/’2l) after seeing a tree struck by
lightning reminds me of a similar incident, although
this cove didn’t see the lightning, being too dead.
The body of a man who had died in a gaol hospital
was lying on the slab in the prison morgue, when
it was struck by lightning, and afterwards it was
fouiid that an outline of the defunct’s face was
marked on the glass of the building. By
getting the light on it at a certain angle it could
be plainly seen. This is no “furphy” ; I’ve seen it.
The gaol governor showed it to most of his visitors
—the permanent guests could see it any old time.
“Gouger”: Some of the nigger tribes here
in Cape York Peninsula (Q.) must have a set of
these weather-divining instruments in their Craniums.
On half a dozen occasions Binghis have warned me
.that a cyclone was coming, and from what direction,
too. Anywhere from six to 12 hours’ notice appears
to be their radius. And they know the difference
between a big blow and a dinkum cyclone. I think
they get some of their weather tips from the birds.
Round about here the birds are plentiful, and noisy,"
and exceedingly cheeky. I noticed that just before
the last two cyclones the . bush grew very quiet, and
when I looked around for the feathered gossips I

you come down?”
saw a few perching very quietly on the branches
of trees near by. Presently these flew away with-
out even one sarcastic cackle. On both occasions
I didn’t see them again until next morning, when
from the ruins of my camp I was trying to fish out
something for breakfast. The cyclones had come in
between.

THE OLD WOOLSHED.
[FOR THE BULLETN.]
There's torn papers and grass and twine tangled
with wool
Lying scattered about on the floor;
The windows are creaking,
The water-tank leaking,
And sand’s creeping in through the door.
The boiler is rusty, the engine is dusty,
Underneath there’s a carpet of rags.
Empty cases and tins
Are in heaps in the bins,
And the corners are crowded with bags.
There’s an odor of tar intermingled with oil,
And a sheepskin or two on the press ;
And white ants and. weather
Are working together,
And the wall’s giving way with the stress.
There are tar-stains and raddle and blood on the
board
That was spilt ere machinery came;
.Some verses in pencil
And numbers in stencil,
And here and there somebody’s name.
There are birds’ nests beside the great beams o l J.ie
roof
■ And up where the long rafters meet,
And in and out plying
The old birds are flying
And the fledglings cry out in the heat.
The skylights are broken, and the ground underneath
Is strewn with dry putty and glass,
And a cat, wild and gaunt,
Startled out of her haunt,
Crouches low and slinks off in the grass.
AFTER TEE CRASH.
“I sa y. mister, if yer want a bloke to sec
that no one pinches yer aeroplane, I’ll
do it for a sprat.”
The gates of the check-pens lie buried in dust
Whet e the cape-weed and melons have, grown j
The westerly whistles
Through weeds and Scotch thistles
A tune to Verbrugghen unknown.
There’s a pile of old hand-shears behind a great 100-
Grim relics of years that are past—
A network of burrows
Where once there, were furrows,
And the rabbits are holding it fast.
There are small heaps of ashes and charred ends
of logs
That mark the old bullocky’s camp:
There’s a gridiron of wire
Beside an old fire,
And a camp-oven under the ramp.
Old rams’ horns and lambs’ tails are lying around
In the yards where they drafted the sheep ;
The race where they branded
Is leaning and sanded,
And the bough-shade lies all in a heap.
There s an old-fashioned whip where they loaded
the wool
With a tree growing up through the stage,
And the gangway has failed
Where the battens were nailed
And is moss-grown and rotten with age.
There’s a long, narrow footpath that twists in and
out,
Winding up from the creek to the shed.
That was made by the tramp
Of the men to the camp
And the hut where they used to be fed.

By keeping the blood pure and active during the Summer months you will
be less susceptible to warm-weather ailments and fatigue. Of course a good
tonic is essential, and CLEMENTS TONIC is popularly regarded as the premier
blood and nerve medicine. You can buy it from the nearest chemist or
storekeeper. Take CLEMENTS TONIC with water or soda-water; either
way it is pleasantly beneficial.
Clements Tonic Ltd., Rozelle, N.S.W.
“Te W.”: The house swallow, of course,
often builds in barns, outhouses, etc., but I have
recently happened on a record of a pair plastering
their mud-bowl nest at the corner of a mantel-piece
in a drawing-room. They laid two eggs, but deserted
them owing to frequent interruption. The birds
made their entrances to and exits from the room
via the chimney. Another pair started to build
beneath a table, but, being insanitary, were ejected.

“Barney”: Tell “Rang” (B. 17/U/’2l)
that the blue wren he saw was probably M. cyanotus,
sometimes called the white-winged superb warbler.
He is a deep cobalt blue with a touch of white on
the wings, quills brown, and tail dark blue. He
is a rarity, and is found usually in the saltbush of
the plains.
* * * *
“Big Bend” : Tell “Wessell” (B. 17/11/’2l i
that if he comes down on to the West Darling he
will find any amount of emus’ nests containing 11
and up to 13 eggs—and they are not partnership
affairs either. I came across one old bird last
week trailing 18 chicks; but I think she must
have been running a baby-farm.
* * * .
Roma”: Not having heard any tidings
of a certain cattleman I asked Long Tom, just in
from the Mulga, what had become of him. “Gone
where the woodbine twineth,” he drawled. Puzzled.
I asked where that was. “Hup a blanky tree,” said
Tom.
MORE CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS.
“Bad Australian”: Charles R. Long, M.A.,
in his “Stories of Australian Exploration” (“for use
in schools”), says, referring to the flying-foxes which
proved such a godsend to Leichhardt in combating
H.C.L. in the vicinity of the Roper River:—
The flying-fox is often called the flying squir-
rel. It has folds of skin extending from the fore
to the hind legs, which enable it to take long leaps.
From this it would appear that Mr. Long was
thinking of the flying phalanger, a marsupial which
is almost invariably referred to by bushmen as the
“flying squirrel ” The flying-fox bears no resem-
blance to the “flying squirrel”—the former is just
an overgrown and particularly offensive bat, whose
room is always preferable to his company.
* * * *
“Gort”: Can any Abo. beat this? An
Irish setter bitch I had in Ireland gave birth to
a litter of 21.
“Moe”: A recent par. (B. 3/11/’2l) con-
cerning a rabbit which went for several weeks with-
out anything to eat presents an interesting phase
ot Mature, which stores up a reserve supply of food
in anticipation of just such an emergency. As a
rule, this supply takes the form of a chemical sub-
stance known as glycogen, or animal starch, and
its storing-place is the liver of mammals. When
all is going well this glycogen plays an unimportant

part; indeed, it is doubtful whether it plays any
part at all. But should anything like a cutting-off
of the regular food occur, the body falls back upon
this reserve, and, by breaking it down into simpler
substances, is able to live upon it. Naturally, this
leads to other changes within the organism, and
new substances, entirely absent under normal condi-
tions, come into existence. Some of these have
characteristic odors, which explains why a man who
has been starved possesses a body-smell which is
Quite distinct and easily recognisable. Some years
ago I saw a prison confinee who had embarked upon
a hunger strike, and after the first five days of iiis
fasting this odor, which is really the odor of sub-
stances into which the broken-down glycogen becomes
transformed, could be smelt 20 yards away.
* * * *
“Bung”; Can anyone tell me if these
Chinks ever knock off work and die? At Bungen-
dore (N.S.W.) George Wah You, a market-gardener,
still going strong, owns up to 92. But the oldest
whites declare that he isn’t nearly so young. They
knew him as “old George” when they were nippers
70 years ago.
“Tim Tiki” : An effective method of catch-
ing quail for the dinner-table is used in a bush-
camp in Taranaki (M.L.). Wheat soaked in whisky
is strewn about, and the quail get so weak in the
knees after a meal that they can easily be knocked
over.
* * * *
“J.H.M.”: By placing a funnel above the
10,000-gallon flow at the Glenmanyie Bore, on Quin-
yambie country, up north, y OU can make a gas-jet.
Put a match to the top of the funnel, and you get
a result which seems to be equal to coal gas, both
in lighting and heating.
* * * *
“Heeagus”: Recently I killed a sft. red-
bellied black snake in a newly dried-up N.Q. creek-
bed with an 18-inch eel half-way down its swallow.
Is this fish-eating habit a newly-acquired vice?
‘ Xallah”: I have often seen the “climb-
ing perch” in Australian mangrove creeks, but
never in open salt-water till recently, when I found
many specimens in the pools of a reef at low
tide. This chap is lighter in color and the head
is finer than the Northern Australian variety. He
is more active, a leap of 18in. being little trouble
to him. In length he would average 31in. He
and I are both of New Guinea.
C. Coral ’: It’s always well to dig out the
chart in Torres Strait rather than rely implicitly
upon native mispronunciation of English names.
Some samples: “Machinery Reef” (Missionary Reef),
“Bramalci” (Bramble Cay), ' Aksun Island” (Heg-
gerstone Island), "Makanby” (Margaret Bay). Boat
names are equally unfortunate; “Gnat” becomes
“Ganet,” “Woodlark” is transformed into “Ulag,”
“Wasp” is “Wassup,” “Mystic” becomes “Mistake,”
and so on.
* * * <
“Moe”; Zoologists are wondering whether
the tiny marsupial know as Lead-
beater’s phalanger (Gymnobeli-
dens leadbeateri) is extinct or
not, it now being some years
since the last wild specimen was
reported. Its natural habitat is
the Bass River Valley country of
Vic., and there, about 30 years
ago, it was to be found in great
numbers. Probably the wholesale
poisoning of ’possums and other
native animals has had something
to do with its disappearance.
Although there is nothing re-
markable about O. leadbeateri’s
appearance, it is of interest to
the biologist because of some of
its glands and other anatomical
features, which give it a place of
its own in the evolutionary tree.
Much research work concerning
these glands has been done by
Drs. W. 0. Mackenzie and Mar-
garet McLorinan, of the Austra-
lian Institute of Anatomical Re-
search (Melb.), although they
have been hampered by the diffi-
culty of obtaining specimens. The
Melb. Museum is the only insti-
tution of its kind which pos-
sesses a Leadbeater’s phalanger in
its collection, there being four in
all. Recently the British Museum
tried unsuccessfully to buy one
of them.
Monaro”: In 1910 I was camped outside
Ganmain (N.S.W.). One day I washed five pairs of
very worn socks, slung them on the fence, and went
into the town. Returning I found my fractured
foot-gear gone and in their place an equal number
very dirty but almost new pairs. I washed them.
Sitting in Hyde Park (Sydney) yesterday I struck
up a yarn with a bushman. Wandering along we
arrived at Ganmain in 1910. Yes, it was him.
We caßed ,4 square, though I easily had the best
or the deal.
Lavinia” : Can any Abo.-specialist give me
a cure for eyes which have been affected by the sap
fi om the native gutta-percha tree ? I know two men
in these Far Northern parts whose eyes have been
practically ruined by it, and up to date all local
ti eatment lias been of no avail.

“Alex’s” ants (B. 1/12/’2l)
which inarch in military array carrying leaf particles
in their jaws may belong to the genus Atii, which
inhabit tiopical America and live in communities.
Certain of the smaller members are the foragers,
which scour the country in search of suitable trees.
These they ascend ; they then bite off small circular
pieces from the leaves and carry them off to their
~ blbor often results in the complete
Defoliation of the tree. Within the nest the leaves
ae cut up into minute fragments and kneaded by
the workers into a spongy mass. On this is culti-
'a e a ungus. Numerous small white bodies appear
after a time on the surface of the “garden,” and
form the staple food of the ants. These white masses
only, appear when the fungus is cultivated in the
ants nest, an d must be the result of some unknown
cultural process.
# * * *
Gouger : Can any Abo.-ite give me a few
practical hints on the making of a perfect slush-
lamp? Mine is aggravatingly imperfect, and it
never seems to know whether it is going to keep on
burning or die gracefully out; to-day it is all leaps
and starts, to-morrow all splutters and gurgles. There’s
a certain type of bushman with that blessed gift of
always doing things the right way. He makes his
slush-lamp the right way. He even makes love the
right way (I Jcnow—the cowl). Will one of him
tell me exactly how to make the perfect bush-light ?

“Alex”: “Exul” (B. 15/12/’2l) is right-
white toms with blue eyes are generally deaf. I
owned one that couldn’t hear a bookmaker calling
the odds two inches away. Nevertheless the stranger
couldn’t approach him from behind nearer than
five yards. The movement was wirelessed to the
cat’s brain through his padded feet. Insulate them,
as I sometimes did for experimental purposes, and
he was as deaf as a grindstone.
* * * *
“Tandawanna”: “Jim Carew” is wrong
(B. 15/12/’2l). Young plovers can swim easny and
rapidly when put to it, and the mother bird, like the
mother duck, calls to them and eggs them on to put
greater distance between them and the threatening
danger. As to the plover not t ing web-footed, I’Ve
seen an emu propel itself ow • 40yds. of deep water;
and, further, if “Jim 0.” takes a gun and collects a
common water-hen he’ll discover another really
good swimmer that isn’t web-footed.

“Sir Spen”: I was sheltering from a hail-
storm under the verandah of the pub, and among my
fellow refugees was an abo., who had been to the
mission school. “What do you reckon makes hail-
stones, Jacky ?” asked someone after various theories
had been expounded. Jacky solemnly considered a
moment, then said: “Mine thinkit streak greasy
lightnin’ been strikem ice-chest belonga God.” ’
LONG METRE.
“Thee'rt late out of chapel this mornin'.”

A BIT SLOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The slowest man I ever knew
Was Peter William Green—
So slow he’d grown but three feet two
When he was seventeen ;
At forty-four on Piper’s Hill
They swear the man is growing still.
He is as slow as red-gum roots.
According to the talk
He gets the white ant in his boots
When going for a walk.
When creeks are dry his neighbors think
Hell get drowned going for a drink.
They found him sitting on a hill
And asked him to explain.
He answered: “Well, it ’appens, Bill,
I’m waitin’ fer the train.”
That was his quickest, I opine
They’d not begun to build the line.
Dan Curtis died at Piper Mill.
They buried him at Callam Town.
You’d think that Pete was standing still,
But really he was moving down,
Although you could not see him whiz.
This Curtis was a friend of his.
Pete came beside a mound at last
Where grew the grass some three weeks old.
He asked a fellow going past.
“The grave of Curtis,” he was told.
Pete answered, humorless and dull:
“I’ve come down fer his funerul.”
VICTORIA.
BILLY T.
Bill Bowyang”: I’ve just seen a short-
sword that was ploughed up in a cane-
field near the Macnade Mill (N.Q.). It
resembles the swords used by the sailors
on Dutch warships in bygone days. I
believe similar weapons have since been
found in the canefield, and I have exam-
ined stone tomahawks which were ploughed
out of the ground near the same spot.
It looks as though a battle took place
hereabouts between Binghi and some of
the early navigators who landed on our
shores a century or more before James Cook saw

Australian literature. Then I come on
some lines to the sea beginning thus: —
Sea of stretched ground-swells!
Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths.
Sea of the brine of life! Sea of unshovelled yet
always ready graves!
From this I turn to Kipling's “Harp Song
of the Danish Women,” dealing with the
same subject:—
What is a woman that you should forsake her
And the hearthttre and the home-acre
To go with the old grey widow- maker ?
She has no house to lay a guest in,
But one chill bed for all to rest in,
That the pale suns and the stray bergs rest in.
She has no strong white arm to fold you,
But the ten times fingering weed to hold you,
Out on the rocks where the tide has rolled you.
Yet when the signs of summer thicken,
And the ice breaks and the birch-buds quicken,
Yearly you turn from our side and sicken—
Sicken again for the shouts and the slaughters,
You steal away to the lapping waters,
And look at your ship in her winter quarters.
You forget our mirth and talk at the tables,
The kine in the shed and the horse in the stables,
To patch her sides and go over her cables.
Then you drive out when the storm clouds swallow,
And the sound of your oar-blades falling hollow
Is all we have left through the months to follow.
Ah, what is woman that you forsake her,
And the hearth-fire and the home-acre,
To go with the old grey widow-maker?
These lines have not the mystifying lack
of meaning that Whitman’s poems have —
the lack of meaning; that the Culture-leaders
love so to surround with learning and deck
out in fine words, but to me they are im-
measurably superior to anything Walt Whit-
man ever wrote or ever was capable of writ-
ing. The logical conclusion of Walt Whit-
man’s shouting is to have every man rise
up and thump his chest and proclaim “I
am !” The logical conclusion of Emerson’s
sane speaking is for every man to look
within himself and say, “I might possibly
be.” In these violently reconstructive post-
war clays there is little doubt in the mind
of any sane man as to which teaching is
likely to do most good in the world.

Conrad and “The Shadowline”
A note from Captain W. J. Snadden:—
Joseph Conrad, in “The Shadowline,” which he
calls “a confession,” relates the experiences of a
young first mate of a steamer who threw up his
billet to take charge of a sailing-ship whose master
had died at sea. This young officer takes over com-
mand of this sailing-vessel at Bangkok, and hears
a description of her late master from the lips of
the chief mate: — ,
“He was a peculiar man of about 65, iron-grey,
hard-faced, obstinate and uncommunicative. He used
to keep the ship loafing at sea for inscrutable rea-
sons. Would come on deck at night sometimes, take
some sail off her, God only knows why or wherefore,
then go below, shut himself up in his cabin and
play on the violin for hours —till daylight, perhaps.
In fact, he sppnt most of his time day or night
playing the violin. That was, when the fit took
him. Very loud, too.”
Confessedly this is an episode in Conrad’s own life ;
the sailing-vessel referred to was the barque Otago
and the deceased captain my father. When Conrad
took over command at Bangkok on May 7, 1888,
the first mate must have pitched Conrad some tall
tales. I do not, therefore, blame Conrad for the
description, for I know that he and my father never
met; but none the less a defence is called for on
behalf of my dead parent, who was as fine a seaman
as ever trod a ship’s deck.
My father was 50 when he died—not 65 —and
was far from being uncommunicative. He certainly
was fond of his violin; but as for keeping the ship
loafing at sea to play it, it is a provable lie. My
father’s hobbies were chess problems and nautical
astronomy, and in the latter he was far more
advanced than most extra-masters of to-day. The
mate —whom Conrad calls Burns —had charge of
my dead father’s effects, but anything of any value
he may have had never_ reached my mother in Aus-
tralia. Incidentally, and arising out of that, the
mate years later got a hiding at Singapore from an
old friend and shipmate of my father.
As to the absurd charge, of making his ship loaf
at sea, I will simply give a statement of the last
voyage my father made in the Otago, and-which was
the only one on which this mate sailed with him.
In 1887, coal-laden from Newcastle (N.S.W.), the
Otago sailed for Haiphong, and after discharging
her cargo of coal and loading and ballasting at that
port, only four months elapsed to the time of my
father’s death. Who can say that there was loafing
there ?
I would not have taken notice of the statements
if Conrad had not alluded to “The Shadowline” as
“a confession,” but this makes it obvious at wh° m
the mud is thrown. As I said before, I do not blame
Conrad, but I drt think he failed in his duty as a
shipmaster in neglecting to see that the effects of
•his dead predecessor were preserved intact. Also
it is not “cricket” to slander the memory of a dead
man on hearsay, even to make a successful novel.
Edward de Vere Identified
David McKee Wright responds :
The attitude of “M.M.P.” (R.P. 8/12/’2l) is pre-
cisely that of archaeologists towards Schliemann when
that investigator ventured to think that Homer had
a background of history. Schliemann took a spade
and confuted them all; Looney has taken a grip
of plain argument, which involves no special scholar-
ship, and has made out a strong case that the works
of Shakspeare were written by Edward de Vere.
That it is a strong case is suggested by the fact
that “M.M.P.” is careful to abstain from any attempt
to deal with the more important points which Looney
raises. When I wrote on this subject here in May,
1920, I was careful to say that Looney advanced
much that was of little or no value. Around
these trifles “M.M.P.” may dance with any vigor his
dignity will permit; but when he has said “Pooh!
pooh!” and “Pshaw!” to them all the big things
still remain.
Here are a few of the arguments by which Edward
de Vere is identified as our greatest English poet:—
The proof arrived at step by step with absolute
certainty that the “Willie” referred to by Edmund
Spenser in terms so large and extravagant that
they could scarcely refer to any but the author of
Shakspeare’s plays was actually De Vere—the two
references being made at times when William Shaks-
peare was 15 and 26 years of age.
The proof that De Vere was associated with Lily
and Munday—the two dramatists to whom, on
authorities quoted, Shakspeare owes most; and pas-
sages from whose plays are exactly paralleled in
Shakspeare’s work.
The proof that De Vere retired to engage in some
absorbing occupation during the very years when
the great dramas appeared and that William Shaks-
peare was during those years living in Stratford,
engaged in money-lending and similar pursuits.
The fact that in Meres’s list of contemporary
poets, published in 1598, De Vere is mentioned as
“best for comedy,” while no play from his pen is
given and all the leading comedies of Shakspeare are
recorded.
All these matters “M.M.P.” side-steps.
“M.M.P.’s” contribution to the controversy
amounts to “Pooh! pooh! Read Dr. Wallace”;
and by his inability to fairly meet the arguments he
strengthens the position of those who feel that
Looney is right.
A Satchel of Books
Lovers and Friends, by E. F. Benson (Fisher
. Unwin). An introspective war bride discovers that
she has married the wrong man. The theme is
skilfully elaborated in 320 pages of polished Eng-
lish, containing much shrewd characterisation. But
the central figure is too frigid to be convincing.
Egan, by llolworthy Hall (Dodd, Mead). Still
another U.S. “small town” yarn. Still another
young-man-back-from-the-war hero. But it is a more
absorbing story than most: it doesn’t just burble, as
these small-town character-studies do, as a rule
And the most romantic flapper couldn’t possibly
want a more satisfactory ending.
The Voyage Home, by Alan Graham (Blackwood).
An ingratiating jewel-thief, arrested at Cairo by a
Scotland Yard detective, induces his captor to keep i,t
a secret until they reach England. Before they
arrive, at Gibraltar both have fallen in love with
fellow-passengers, and there are other complications.
An entertaining and well-written novel in thef B 2
class.
San Cristobal de la I lab ana, by Joseph Herges-
hoimer (Heinemann). A series of chromatic im-
pressions of the Cuban capital. Sometimes he is
as lavish with color as Conrad, sometimes he is as
dark and sententious as James ; but always he is
the exceptional spectator who only ugards the cocks
in a Cuban cocß-fight, for instance,, as part of a
brilliantly-tinted design.
Art and Letters; Hassell’s Australian Miscellany
1921-2 (Hassell, Adelaide). There is a suggestion
of “Art in Australia” in the get-up, but the Adel-
aide production is more varied in contents. There
are some line illustrations, in color and half-tone,
and the prose and verse, though here and there
smelling a little of the lamp, are fairly well selected.
The whole thing is admirably produced.
For Me Alone, by Andrg Corthis (George Allen
and Unwin). An English version of “Pour Moi
Sei le,” the novel that was awarded the Grand
Prix du Roman in Paris last year. A keen study
of a woman in a French village who realises the
small and futile character of the doctor to whom
she is married; but it loses something of the
Gallic flavor in the translation.
The Shadow, by Mary W. Ovington (Harcourt,
Brace). An unwanted white child, born out of
wedlock in a Southern State, is surreptitiously con-
veyed to a cabin in (he, negro quarter and is reared
by kindly black preacher-folk. In after years when
she learns the truth she clings to her colored
mammy and lies to shield her foster-brother from
the wrath of her white lover. A picturesque
statement of the case for Uncle Ham.
Some Pirates and Marmadulce, by' E. A. Wylie
Smith (Lane). A delightful burlesque of the turgid
post-Stevensonian buccaneer novel. The author apolo-
gises at the outset for the prevalence of rum in his
pages, but justifies his- choice of an island as the
locality of the buried treasure. “That,” he explains,
“is what islands are for.” His story is humorous
from first to last, and George Morrow’s illustrations
are great.
The Secret Victory, by Stephen McKenna (Hut-
chinson). The third novel of the, series, called
“The Sensationalists.” Eric Lane gets interested
in a haphazard damsel, Ivy Maitland, whose society
somewhat softens his regrets for the loss of his pre-
vious charmer, Lady Barbara Neave. Why he
doesn’t marry the girl isn’t explained satisfactorily ;
and the yarn is always a bit hectic arid second-rate
in discussing the emotions of the leading characters.
Poor White, by Sherwood Anderson (Jonathan
Cape). The success of “Main Street” has let
loose a flood of books about life in the U.S. small
town; and this is another of them. Hugh McVey
is the hero —a queer sort of hero; the descendant
of “poor whites” who moved up from the slave-
owning South. But he has brains and helps his
small town to industrial greatness. As a study of
a “poor white” the book has a little more value
than most of its too-numerous class.
Westralian Cavalry in the War, by Lieut.-Colonel
A. C. N. Olden, D.S.O. (McCubbin, Melbourne). A
remarkable narrative of the work of the 10th Light
Horse in Gallipoli, Palestine and Egypt. The regi-
ment, serving as infa,ntry, was in some of the wann-
est corners of the Peninsula right up to the evacua-
tion. It was among the first troops to enter the
Holy City, and beat the rest of the army in the
rush on Damascus, taking over the place from the
Emir Said at 6.30 in the morning of Ist October,
1918. Olden modestly effaces himself from his stir-
ring yarn, but receives his due tribute in a fine
Foreword by Lieut.-General Chauvel. The book,
which runs to 343 pages, is profusely illustrated
with maps and photographs, and has frequent flashes
of humor. Talking of the affection of the Aussies
for the Highlanders, Olden says: “That the cheery,
unassuming style of these ‘Scotties’ greatly appealed
to the : Light Horsemen is strikingly evidenced by
the fact that never once did our men ’ attempt to
‘pinch’ a horse from them.”
The Inky Way
“Fleet Street”: Blind man’s friend Arthur Pear-
son gave up his Daily Express a good many years
ago, after much sturdy battling with Harmsworth,
now Northcliffe. Pearson was the first man in the
running for The Times when it began to flop from
its altitude, but “The better showman wins!” he
declared when Harmsworth carfte in. In his days
of intense activity he put his fingers into every pie
in his offices, but he met his master in the Scotch
printer of his Express. ‘Tup the proprietor of this
paper,” Pearson said, on one occasion. “Yes, and I’m
its printer, and there’ll be no paper at all this morn
unless ye sling oot o’ here damn quick,” said Jock.
Pearson didn’t wait.
“Pitman”: Re family newspaper shows (B.
S/12/’2l). In the office of the Adaminaby Advocate,
southern Monaro (N.S.W.), Dave Baragry and his
three sons run the whole box of tricks. The nearest
approach I ever knew to that was when Joe Plow-
right founded the Mullumbimby (N.S.W.) Star in
1905, and he, his daughter and his brother-in-law
issued a very newsy weekly sheet between them.
'jfMt *•
“Graeme”: Re family-run newspapers (B.
8/12/’2l). In 1896, after the New Australia
bubble burst in Paraguay, P. ,1. Maenamara, one of
the disillusioned Utopians, and his family, girls
included, produced the Ch'arleville (Q.) Gouriek
unaided. There was no editorial chair, P.J. and
another of the male staff setting the leaders and
most of the reported matter, “out of their heads”
without copy. The girls were good comps., too.
“Whitebait”: I see that an enthusiastic gathering
of Sassiety ladies has decided to support a farewell
benefit to a couple of professional musicians for the
purpose of furthering their studies in Europe. Bene-
fits are always being showered on musicians, and
painters are given scholarships; but the writer,
however high his promise or achievement, never gets
any patronage, except from little literary societies
that meet in back rooms and read papers on his
work. The lack of popular recognition is mainly
due to the scribbler’s negligible opportunities for
advertisement among a class which never reads.
The result is that young Strectons and Melbas are
getting quite a good stait in life, whilst, with the
possible exception of 0. .1. Dennis, our best authors
are no better off financially than when they began.
It is not only an absurd position: it is discreditable
to us as a people.
“Wal”: A magazine has just come to me from
the U.S.A. with a short story in the front pages
fairly screaming that it was written “dff the chart.”
The hero does all sorts of weird and impossible
things on a pearling lugger, the like of which the
pearling grounds never saWy and then comes to
Moresby to see the Chinese “fan-tan hells” for which
the town is noted ! The description . of. diving is
grotesquely incorrect from start to finish. For in-
stance, the hero “removes liis helmet by' unscrewing
the nuts that held it to'the dress.” Helmets are at-
tached to a brass or gun-metal corselet by locking a
thread that • requires only a half-turn to securely
hold it. This sort of trash comes to Australia for
the consumption of the reading public, while local
writers with decent stuff cannot get an outlet for
their brains. As to the “Chinese hells,” one ancient
Chow grows cabbages out on the Laloki River, eight
miles from Moresby, and the only others in the
territory reside in the Samarai district.
“Billy”: The resource of the Arqus fills me with
admiration and respect. About once a year it has
a violent fit of enterprise, and being in the place
where it is demanded of conscience to instruct and
entertain, it casts about for some happy subject upon
which to exert its talent. The outcome is either a
spirited article on the Mint, with copious, photo-
graphs, or a thrilling column on the playful ways of
the elephant at the Zoo, with photographs in plenty.
There are quite a lot of interesting things going on
in our world, but in the Arhus the Mint and the Zoo
crop up with unfailing regularity. I know that when
Gabriel comes and the heavens are falling the newly-
risen will find copies of the Argus on their graves
containing a jubilant article on one or the other
(with photographs).
“Lou” : In Brisbane’s Public Library there’s not one
of Henry Lawson’s books. After a vain search I
asked an attendant to make sure, and that’s the
astonishing result I left with.
E. S. Warren-Bell, just dead in England, having
never really recovered from war injuries, was an
author who made a name with school and sporting
stories, and then, with comparative leisure as
editor of the Captain, wrote books with a wider
appeal and a play or two. The better-known “Keble
Howard” is his brother.
“T. 0.1.”: Reference to the old days of Kyneton
(Vic.) (B. 24/11/’2l) reminds me that in the mid-
’sixties I was deputed by the Garrick Club, on the
invitation of the president, R. H. Horne (“Orion”),
to go to Kyneton and hear him lecture in aid of the
funds of the local Mechanics’ Institute. I forget
the title of the lecture, but it smacked of general
literature and some reminiscences of Horne’s con-
temporaries in London. His opening words I well
remember: “The early bird gets the worm! That’s
all very well for the bird, but how about the worm?”
At that time Horne was warden of the Trentham
goldfields, some distance from Kyneton, with a cot-
tage home at St. Kilda. I passed the evening with
the old gentleman, who was very reminiscent. He
made no secret of the fact that he spent a good deal
of his time in Melbourne and St. Kilda, as the
sergeant of police “looked after the office work” —in
fact, the job was almost a sinecure. He returned to
England in 1867 and seven years later got a Civil-
service pension of £lOO a year. He passed out
with 81 years to his credit at Margate in 1884.
“Vandorian” (Loncl.) : Stephen Leacock, with a
rough stubble of thick iron-grey hair and a small
wiry moustache, is a wild man compared with Owen
Seaman, editor of Punch, who was in the chair on
the evening I listened to the comicalities of the re-
nowned Canadian professor. Having made “a name,”
Leacock’s : backwood style of hairdressing was for-
given (by degrees) by a fashionable London audience.
It froze stiff at the outset, but thawed presently.
’Leacock is even move amusing than his books. He
•seems to be bubbling with fun, and turns his jokes
over in his mouth before ejecting them. His shirt-
front was quite wild alongside the glacial calm of
the Punch man’s glazed linen, for Owen Seaman is
one of the best-dressed men in Hie village.
“Wodgil”: Billy Clare, the picturesque veteran
who would pass for a twin-brother of ftfark Twain,
has been writing the history of his Coolgardie
Miner for Dick Spear’s “Golden West.” What a
fine paper the Miner was, and what a staff it had !
Consider some of the men who toiled for it: “Smiler”
Hales, war correspondent and author of 35 novels;
Jack Drayton, now on Smith’s Weekly ; the late F.
C. B. Vosper, ed. Perth Sunday Times, and brilliant
M. L. A. ; “Dryblower” Murphy, Groperland’s poet
laureate ; Ben Strange, most humorous of Westralian
cartoonists; George Kingswell, ed. Johannesburg
Sunday Times ; Charlie Rose, ed. London Boxing ;
Jack Cameron, war correspondent, later editing a
paper at Nice: Bert Toy, ed. Sydney Sunday Times,
now on The Bulletin ; Harry Ivneebone, ed. Adel-
aide Daily Herald ; Harry Davies, mining ed. West
Australian, and Jack Underwood, who controls a
big daily at Seattle, U.S.A. And there were others,
like Jack Drake (the bush has swallowed him up
for years), , and witty Larry Goodrich, and Herbert
Norton, the sporting writer, and Ridsdale, who be-
came well known in Fleet-Street, as 1 discovered long
afterwards when visiting that storied thoroughfare.
Truly -a matchless staff.
“S.T.S.”: One gets from Conan Doyle’s new book
on his Australian tour the little-known fact that the
“Raffles” novelist Homing (who died just as Doyle
got back to Europe) was his brother-in-law. The
super-detective and the super-cracksman sprang from
the same, family. -
IN MEMORIAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We do not sing to the mournful sub.,
For he is a thing despised ;
And the chief who sits in his secret den,
Shaping the policy with his pen,
Is the Devil himself disguised.
No joyful note for the lino, man,
Or the hell-cursed engineer;
And the printerman who will talk of “pi”
To a jaded comp, when the dawn draws nigh
Is a terrible fiend to fear.
But there is one whom the gods will mind
When our cares are wiped away,
And we walk on a path of sunlit gold,
Where never the story of ink is told,
And there’s never a bill to pay.
So a song to the lad with the mottled face,
Who stood by the overseer,
In the days that are lost in the misty gloom,
Of an age swept past by the Grundy broom —
The devil who fetched the beer !

“8.R.C.”: Jaques Bros., of Richmond
(Vic.), have again shown what Australian
engineers can do by building a. stone-crusher
that weighs 75 tons. The huge machine,
which was erected with special plant for the
Portland Cement Cos. (Geelong), includes
frame castings of 22 tons and a main shaft
forged from an 8-ton billet of Australian
steel. The Jaqueses, who beat the importer
for the job, guarantee that the implement
will mash up 1500 tons of rock every eight
hours. 1
Adelaide Tramways Trust has put on the
track a sample of a tieet of new cars. "Lung

is avoided, and the length is 49 feet. At
the extremities ar.e saloons; in the middle
are the smokers’ seats. The accommodation
for strap-hangers is lavish, and tells Adel-
aide what to expect. The model is the
latest American, though the cars are good
Australian in every other way. But the.
cost—close on £4OO0 —is likely to cut down
the original intention to order 50.

“Vernon 1.”: The Darwin pubs, which
used to eat up money when the Common-
wealth ran them, are turning back to pro-
ductivity under private enterprise. For the
Victoria, the “silver-tails’ home,” which was
a white elephant under Boynton’s depart-
ment, Mrs. “Wolfram” Brown is paying
£lO a week rent, not to mention the license
fee, and it is not supposed that she is losing
any sleep or cash over the business. And
this in spite of the fact that she has reduced
the cost of board and lodging by 17s. 6d. a
week.
“Janus” : A woman-farmer near Geelong-
showed ingenuity in dealing with a recent
caterpillar invasion. While out driving she
noticed swarms of the pests making towards
her crops. During the night she collected a
flock of sheep, and from daylight onwards
her young son and a dog drove these sheep
up and down a paddock between the advanc-
ing hosts and the fruits of her year’s toil.
She killed thousands, and so delayed the
advance of the others that, with the assist-
ance of neighbors, she was able to save hey
whole crop.

“Gregor”: It is over a year since the sec-
retary of the Australian Institute of Chem-
ists—the only technical employment agency
in this country—was applied to for a man,
■and there are . over 50 chemists (I don’t
mean mere pharmacists) unemployed in Mel-
bourne alone. Australian employers are
showing plainly that they have little time
for the skilled technologist, and prefer the
old, wasteful ways. To quote only one in-
stance, the American gasworks directorate
would consider anybody fit for the lunatic
asylum who suggested throwing away the
coal-tar which is the product of the gas-
retorts without attempting to recover from
it the valuable drugs, etc., of which it is
the source. Yet there is not a single tar-
distiller.y in the Commonwealth, which in con-
sequence is forced to import each year mil-
lions of pounds’ worth of chemicals that could
be obtained from this by-product. And if any
further indication of the contempt in which
applied science is held in this country were
needed, it is supplied by a large metal-refin-
ing company which, when two students asked
it for work recently at the end of a ’Varsity
course with honors, offered them jobs >as
laborers at 12s. a dav on the plea that they
possessed no “practical knowledge.” It is
this sort of thing that makes the enthusiastic
young chemist or technologist go abroad. It
has been estimated there are over 250 Aus-
tralian chemists in U.S.A., and you find them
scattered as far afield as in China and India
—mainly because of the utter, lack of co-
ordination between Australian Universities
and our leaders of commerce.
THE TUG BOAT SKIPPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oll m ay keep your swanky liner and your mammoth
cargo-boat,
And your oak-leaves, badge and buttons and the
braid upon your coat;
They may go down with the ladies and the town-
bred tourist mug,
But I’d see the lot in Hades ere I’d swap ’em for
my tug.
Just a battered little tow-boat, but she’s all the
world to me—
She s my club-room by the jetty and my home upon
the sea ;
And my cobbers in the wind-bags or the liners nevei
know '
Of the jay that’s mine when straining to a hundred-
fathom tow.
I’m the skipper of a tow-boat —watch the liner-
johnnies sneer
Till we get her by the bow-line and point her for
the pier.
If her middle was on hinges she might do without
our aid,
But 1 guess they’ll use the tow-boats till the rubber
1 ships are made!
Now the wind-bag from the south’ard, with no
guyver and no lace,
Flies her signal, “Want a tow-boat,” with a smile
upon her face ;
And her weather-beaten catheads in a welcome nod
incline,
As we steam around to wind’ard and throw the
heaving line.
Ain’t it good to feel the tow-boat cock her ears to
hear them say,
As they get the mud-hook ready for the ground in
Neutral Bay,
“Heave, oh heave her round, my johnnies, here’s
the tug for Sydney-down ;
There’s a girl for each in Gcorge-street now that
London’s turned us down!’’
I’m the skipper of a tow-boat arid the lover of her
too - -
Don’t she know each thought I’m thinking? Ain’t
my heart her churning • screw ?
Don’t a spoke or two control her? Ain’t a soul
her engine got ?
I thank the Lord that led me to command a “coffee-
pot” !

OVER 600,000 OWNERS
In a little over six years more than 600,000 Dodge Brothers
Cars have been placed in the hands of owners.
If this sales record represented the appeal of a price, the total
might not be regarded as particularly impressive.
The important thing is that the car is not thought of in terms
of price; but in terms of value.
How often you hear the car spoken of—how seldom the price!
The eagerness to own the car is greater to-day than it ever
has been.

OUR FINANCIAL POLICY.
[Foit The Bulletin.]
We borrow, and we 'borrow on,
Thus hoping to evade a bust,
And trusting, when all else is gone,
That Gabriel will raise the dust.
VICTORIA. DIDO.
“Ron H.” : Here’s my nomination for feet.
He's an employee of one of the Broken Hill
mines, is 6ft. 2in. high, weighs 20st., and
takes seventeens in boots.
Jack Adams, secretary of the Hobart
Marine Board, went west the other day at
53. He ran a thorn into his linger and it
set up blood-poisoning. Adams started on
the Hobart Mercury, but stepped off the
Inky Way at an early stage.
Major-General J. W. McCay has dropped
into still another Government job. He has be-
come “business adviser to the Commonwealth
in connection witli war-service homes mat-
ters,” and E. G. Hicks is his secretary. This
time last year McCay ceased to be chairman
of the Yic. Profits Commission, as the Act
faded out. He is still a State Savings Bank
Commissioner, but there is only about £400
a year in that.
When Danny Levy ceased to be N. S.
Wales Speaker the gratitude of the A.W.U.
paper to the philanthropist who had en-
abled Dooley and McGirr to hold office with-
out a majority burst its confines. Danny
was genially described as “an insignificant
politician, a capitalist job-hunter, a man so
essentially little, a buzzing insect in autho-
rity.. . .of no more importance than the pro-
verbial fly on the wheel.” It must have been
a. desperate struggle to keep all that moral
indignation dammed up for 18 months.
"T'.O.I.”: With the coming of . the Irish
Ereh State out will go the L^rd-Lieutenancy,
which for 560 years has been an institution
at 'The Castle” and the “V. It. Lodge” in
Phoenix Park. The L.-L. of 1361 (the first
on the list) was Lionel, son of King Edward
III., which probably explains why a son of
the present King was immediately sug-
gested as the first Governor-General under
the new order. Notwithstanding the
troublous times the “ould sod” has passed
through no L.-L. has ever been shot at.
"Ando” : Undoubtedly the Thermopylae and
other clippers performed wonderful sailing
feats from the U.K. to Australia, but even
their best days’ runs are not greatly ahead of
those of the fleet of schooner-clippers that
traded between the Richmond River (N.S.W.)
and Sydney in the cedar industry last cen-
tury. Among these were the Wallace and
Bruce, a 98-ton brigantine, and the schooners
Ocean Bride, Amphitrite, Saucy Jack and
Monarch. It was quite common in the
late ’70’s for these to do the 331-mile trip
from Sydney to Ballina at a 12-knot gait.
In April. 1878, the two first named left Syd-
ney Heads together, and reached Ballina —the
W. and B. a few minutes ahead—in a shade
under 25 hours.
“Stamps” : “Coolyah” must have a strained
leg after listening to his postal acquaintance
(B. 15/12/’21), why told him that-“to com-
pensate for mistakes in change an overcharge
is made on parcels,” the excess stamps being
removed and resold. Postal officials have a
Decalogue of Risks, and “Thou shalt for
thine own safety do no funny business at
the counter” is the most-carried-out command-
ment of all. Let detached stamps be found
in an official’s “advance,” and Trouble spells
itself with a capital T; let him be seen
removing stamps and dismissal leers at him.
He may escape by clever lying, but he will
not try it on again, for the resulting suspicion
is never-dying. As for rooking Chinamen,
the man who chooses John for his experi-
ments hasn’t ever met John in business.
“Zanthus”: The Goulburn (N.S.W.) dis-
trict has a curiously intimate association
with explorers and pathfinders. Hamilton
Hume and W. II. Hovell were both connected
with it at one time or another. The Jar-
dines, who drove cattle to Cape York in the
’sixties, were bred down that way, and so
were the McDonalds and Duracks, who in
the ’eighties drove cattle-right across Aus-
tralia to the Kimberleys (W.A.). The two
McDonalds, Charles and William, with
Donald McKenzie, Peter Thompson, James
McGeorge and James Pickles, started from
Tuena in March, 1883, and went across by
way of Nevertire (N.S.W.) and Cooper’s
Creek. They got to the Fitzroy River
country well on in 1886. The Duracks
started from Isisford (Q.) on June 6, 1883.
and reached their Kimberley run on Sept.
17. 1885.
“Tin Hat” : “Pongo’s” query (B. 15/12/’21)
as to why some enterprising Australian firm
does not manufacture wooden planes and kin-
dred tools is one which has long puzzled
tradesmen who have to pay ridiculous prices
for the imported article. Cabinet-makers
can be found in most shops who use planes
(especially smoothers) made by themselves
from all sorts of timber. The best trying
plane I have seen was made by its owner
from the trunk of a pear-tree, and I remem-
ber a smoother made by a foreman from an
old red-gum post. It was in a class by
itself, and would clean up any kind of figured
timber as well as the best expensive block-
steel type of tool. Carefully seasoned and
quarter sawn, there is no reason why
several of our timbers should not prove suit-
able for all the planes we want.
“M.D.”: To bring the Federal Health
Department into line with that of progres-
sive countries, a new job, that of Director
of Industrial Hygiene, has been created, the
appointment going to Dr. D. G. Robertson
at £900 per annum, which is a very good
screw in these times of comparative low-
water in private practice. Also, the Inter-
national Health Board (I never heard of it
before, but it pays in dollars) has offered
four travelling fellowships to Australian
medical graduates, who* are to proceed to
U.S.A. for a year’s study in preventive medi-
cine, and are to get 1200 dollars if they are
single and 2000 dollars if married. ’ The
appointments must be meant for young men
who have private means; the ' successful
candidates get travelling expenses for them-
selves, but none for encumbrances. A por-
tion of the course of study may be spent in
Europe, and at the end of it the expert
must agree to spend five years in the Federal
Health service. But thus far that service
doesn’t offer specialists anything very tempt-
ing in the way of jobs. “ -

Electric Light s Electric Power : Engine Power;
all from this wonderful plant
Stiidy carefully the wonderful services offered you in
Western Electric Power and Light. Some of them are
shown above. Will you deny yourself and your womenfolk
all of these comforts ?
Help was never so hard to get. And it is becoming harder
to get ;< That is—human help! But there was never a time
when help ” was so plentiful and so well within reach—if
you look in the right direction. And that direction is
Western Electric.
For a sum that is equal to the hire of about one pair of
hands you can buy a servant with twenty pairs of hands—
one that never tires, never quhs, never fails in duty.
If it were only a question of dear, bright, clean, safe light—
that would be sufficient recommendation for Western
Electric Power and Light. But there are the many
power services as well that make you an Aladdin of to-
day with the most magical and obedient ot slaves.
Electric light—housework, farmwork—whatever is needed
from domestic light and power—is best done, quickest done,
and cheapest done by Western Electric.

These “too-late-for-classification” advts.
sometimes classify themselves, as they d.d
the other day in a Melbourne paper:—
Tc Mr. and Mrs. Blank, on the 10th, a son.
Young man, good position, respectable, would
settle down, wishes correspond young lady, view
above. Write .
“Enryb”: The new Labor leaders’ theo-
retical disregard for color is bearing fruit.
Though in Queensland the unions still profess
to want a White Australia, Punjabis were
welcomed to the A.W.U. strike camp at Bun-
daberg during a bite trouble in the sugar
industry.
Went west at Buenos Ayres recently,
Ernest Shadforth, late of North Queensland.
He collected a D.S.O. in the Boer War, and
was one of the 100 soldiers who represented
Australia and Maoriland at the coronation
of King Ned. After that he went to South
America has joined the staff of a big freezer
at Buenos Ayres as live-stock manager.
“Azrim” : Half the household being down
with ’flu wo had to instal a locum to look
after the practice, and the banker’s wife lent
us her maid to “answer the bell.” We
thought we had a treasure until we found she
greeted each patient rapturously as follows:
"No! Doctor has the ’flu ; but he’s got a
splendid locomotive to do his work.” The
B.M.A. will undoubtedly expel her when it
hears.
“Rae-akiaki”: I nominate the schooner
Lauel Whalen for the protracted voyage
stakes. She started from Adelaide for Van-
couver on October 11, 1918, and arrived at
her destination the second week in April,
1920. During the trip she had put into
Sydney, Auckland and Papeete for various
reasons. Another, case of the same sort was
the Norwegian ship Bragdo, which took a
year and a few weeks to go from New York
to Sydney.
“Raffles”: Uncle Sam loses no oppor-
nity of impress.ng the virtues of his tined
fruit, gramophones, chewing-gum and tinned
dog on the silent, sullen peoples who are
half-savage and half-kid. Scaddan, of
Westralia, found that out when he took a
party of manufacturers and commercials
north in the Government motor-ship Kan-
garoo to drum for business in Java and the
Malay States. At Singapore they struck a
gorgeous Californian delegation on the same
lay. The newspapers gave the Westralians
preference in the matter of space, but the
crowds —which means the simple children
of nature —followed the Yanks. For the
Californian outfit included a jazz band.
“D.R.C.” : Apropos Captain Billy Butcher,
ex-mercantile marine and ex-gold prospector
(B. 1/12/’2l). He was for a time in charge
of the Adelaide S. S. Co.’s Westralian
affairs, and while he was there a newly-
appointed general manager decided to pay a
visit to the W.A. branch. When he arrived
at Fremantle he went to Butcher’s office
and entered unannounced. Billy at the
moment was trying over a tune on the banjo,
an instrument he used to handle like an
expert. The new g.m. came to a full stop
in the doorway. Butcher nodded towards a
chair, saying “Good day; have a seat,” and
went on with his pinka-pinka-panging. But
the visitor never moved till Billy’s fingers
struck the final chord. Then he asked with
an Arctic air: “Are you Captain Butcher?”
“Yes.” “I am the new general manager of
the A. S. S. Cos.” “Oh, are you?” chirped
William. “Well, have two blanky seats !”
“Wilfrido”: When Anzac sergeant Ken-
neth Bayne was on his way home after a
distinguished career in Gallipoli and France,
he saw a child fall overboard, and though he
had only one arm he jumped in—and
neither he nor the youngster was seen again.
It is almost certain that sharks got them.
When the residents of his township (Pahia-
tua) proposed to erect a memorial to Bayne,
the Mayor objected on the ground that the
act was not that of a brave man but of a
lunatic. This curious attitude raised a
storm of protest from those who had fought
with Bayne, and others who had known
him. The local paper refused presently to
publish anything further regarding it, but
vigorous letters saw print elsewhere through-
out M.L., and the writer of one turned a
neat sentence: “There are two persons who
would not regard the act as a brave one—
the Mayor of Pahiatua and Kenneth Bayne.”
From a veteran unionist
Without consulting ticket-holders the A.W.U.
executive recently raised the yearly subscription
from £1 to 255. and struck a compulsory levy of
10s. for the Labor daily papers. The call was fol-
lowed up by a circular from headquarters announc-
ing that any lover of freedom who failed to toss
half a quid into the hat would be “unfinancial,” and
in the event of any industrial dispute arising would
have to fight his own battle. This although he had
already paid the executive 255. for a year’s protec-
tion, and is supposed to have a right to vote on
matters of importance to the union. During the
past 10 years the A.W.U. —once a grand Australian
institution —has slipped back half a century. Amongst
the old stalwarts of the Bush hope has long since
faded. With Tammany oppression on the one side,
and a loafing foreign rabble on the other, they are
restricted to a choice between the Devil and the
deep sea. What is wanted is anew Australian
union for workers who are disgusted with present
arrangements but are afraid to say so. Unfor-
tunately there is no industrial Messiah on the horizon
yet.
THE DOCTOR’S BELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
James Watson had a grievous cold;
His voice was low and husky,
Wherefore one evening, so I’m told,
As it was growing dusky,
He hobbled over to demand
Advice of Dr. Brown
Who. had the fattest practice -d
The fairest wife in town.
Arrived before the doctor’s house
His oft-repeated knockings
Brought to the door the doctor’s spouse
In lingerie and stockings.
With vocal chords that seemed to strain
Upon the slightest sound,
He somehow managed, under pain,
To croak “Is doc. around ?”
Then what was his surprise and doubt
(I’d hardly say chagrin)
When, having slyly peered without,
She murmured “No —come in!”

BELLS
The voices of bells! How imperative their
command! How earnest their entreaty!
What memories they recall! What warnings
they utter!
The making of bells dates back to primitive times, and their
forms have evolved from crude, wooden planks to the
modern shape cast in scientifically amalgamated metals.
Bell-casting is an important part of our business, and we can
supply bells of suitable weight and correct tone value for
Churches, Schools, Fire Brigades, Ships, Factories and
Memorials. For many years past our bells have been used
in various parts of the Commonwealth and the Islands. Sizes
range from Bin. to 36in. in diameter, and weigh from about
201 b. to half a ton. Angle Steel Towers are supplied for
use where belfries are not available.
Being made by Australian craftsmen, our bells are promptly
delivered—free from overseas freight and duty charges. An
illustrated leaflet and price list will be gladly sent post free
on request.

Melbourne’s present orgy of pantomime
rbakes the Sundry Showman wonder whether,
after all, the increases of wages haven’t been
in excess of the extra cost of living. There
must be some reason for things being so very
much they never were before. At H.r
Majesty’s, where there are no alarming bar-
gains in seating accommodation, “Babes in
the Wodd” has been a protracted feast of
matinees. Always, so far, there have been
two crowded houses per diem of the J.C.W.
annual, in addition to 12 performances a
week of each of two other pantos. At a
rouedi estimate average Melbourne attend-
ances at the recitals of the Dames’ woes
amount to 12,000 per day. The efforts
to prolong this holiday rush on behalf
of “The Babes” include the announce-
ment that the show cost £15,000 to produce.
And even then, silk tights being so exoen-
sive, in some cases they were dispensed
with. The costumes worn by Norah Delaney,
the principal boy, justify the lady’s earnest
to make the most of herself, and
are almost an ample apology for her exces-
sive facial expression. On the other hand,
there can be no excuse for the foolishness
of the Dame’s songs, whereof “There You
Are, Then,” is a shocking example, or for the
fact that Robin Hood gets the support of
the chorus in chanting praises to Coal-black
Mammy. Another inexcusable feature of
this sometimes-unconventional appeal to the
spirit of Christmas, or whatever spirit it is
that a panto, does appeal to, is the printing
of song-words on the programme. A person
who takes the programme home and reads
in cold blood the lines he has been listening
to is likely to be seized with sudden pains
in the understanding. For the rest, and
mentioning only • matters not previously
alluded to, Audrey Thacker, in the charac-
ter of a minor outlaw, is nice and breezy.
She doesn’t get a chance to really matter,
except when she sings her one and only solo,
but she arouses a suspicion that she might
matter in an hour of need.

tenced to solitary

Hood. How Robin
gets into the plot
is a mystery which
the literature on
the subject doesn’t
solve. Still, in the matured Fuller judgment
the infants’ appetite for trrragedy is so keen
that breaking and entering into more than
one fairy store is justified—in fact, de-
manded.

“Bluebeard,” at the Princess’s, is the best
panto the Fullers have yet presented in Mel-
bourne. The scenery has made an unusual
hole in the firm’s money-box, and there are
more expensive flights of fancy in the raiment
ot the girls who frequently fling a leg under
a distracting symposium of colored lights.
Ihe principals are also a more competent lot,
thoug:h Nellie Kolle might be a more tuneful
PJ I^ cl P boy. She could afford to lend some
of her power to Fifi de Tisne, whose soprano
is rather petite, though it is melodious enough
foi a couple of jazzy items with a full-voiced
chorus and a tumultuous band. Among the
other sex no one is more entitled to another
complimentary mention than Jim Gerald as
the Dame. In certain acrobatic aspects
James is the mirror of Barry Lupino, and he
also suggests the other in his picture of
frowsy, combative womanhood. Gerald has
a cheerful, infectious personality, and his in-
fluence is well illustrated when he gets the
audience to roar the refrain of “A Noise
Annoys an Oyster,” a piece of exceptional
imbecility.

“Tea for Three,” at Melbourne King’s, lias
the negative virtue of not being spectacular
in the Christmas sense of the term. Some
charming little stage pictures are worked
into the story of how Graham Browne
caused particular trouble by getting away
with Marie Tempest’s photo (which her jeal-
ous husband has been in the habit of kissing
every time they met), but one can sit in
the King’s all the evening without being
disturbed by a chorus or a ballet. The
general effect of “Tea for Three” is restful.
Even when a social storm threatens one
naturally expects to discover that it was
only a storm in a teacup, consequently the
news that Graham
Browne has
shuffled off this
mortal coil leaves
the audience mostly
cold. Nobody feels
convinced that a
violent death could
possibly happen to
Browne in a bright
little comedy of
this sort, where-
fore nobody shud-
ders when be drops
in to explain that
he never was dead
at all. This is
perhaps the car-
dinal sin of the
comedy—its failure
to deceive when it
is doing its best to
be deceitful. The
audience is not
made a fool of, as
by “Seven Keys to
Baldpate.” There
is wit and humor
and highly-finished
acting in the
fragile entertain-
ment, but the
story never grips
an intelligent per-
son’s very best attention.

Somehow “The Frolics of 1921,” which
embody the well-worn ideas of previous
reviews and go back as far as the old
mascotte panto of “Mother Goose” for an
aeroplane situation, appear to serve the
oofish purposes of Melbourne Tivoli. Two
performances a day are not too many for
present business requirements, owing per-
haps to Rickaby and other causes over which
the Frolics have no control. True, the
gloomiest Frolic of the series has been
excised. "The Dance of Death” is dispensed
with, and inasmuch as the D.O.D. was
neither sufficiently well done to be horrible
nor sufficiently amateurish to be uninten-
tionally funny, the item deserved to get
blown out. Nothing is more reprehensible
in entertainment than underdone gruesome-
ness. But there remains plenty that is re-
prehensible enough. The things that Ley-
land Hodgson and George Moon say to one
another, for instance, are beyond the pale
of verbal criticism. The Btjixetin heaves
a brick at that long list of labored banalities
and passes on, merely remarking that the
magic carpet, which enables Hodgson to
wish for the miraculous appearance of Moon,
is a base reminder of the box of pills whereby
comedian Clarke of old used to wish himself
into divers places.

“The Cup of Life,” at Melbourne Majestic
this week, shows love and romance developing
in a Singapore setting. The heroine of the
yarn is the adopted daughter of a Chow mer-
chant, and she sees a promise of bliss in the
son of a pearl-smuggler who owns a vast gem
that excites the cupidity of her dad. “Dollar
for Dollar,” at the same house, is a com-
paratively quiet drama that is almost a rest-
cure for active Frank Keenan. At Hoyt’s
pretty Ora Carew is “Under Suspicion” as a
remarkable flattite renting a rich man’s home
without his knowledge. “The Hidden Truth,”
another of Hoyt’s masterpieces, takes the
populace to Nuesret City, where a prospective
prima donna, a couple of mine-salters and a
drunken bully and his missus share the atten-
tions of the camera. At the Town Hall the
Carrolls are presenting the “Blue Mountains
Mystery,” founded on “The Mount Marunga
Mystery,” by Harrison Owen. The yarn is
well handled, and the photography first-class.
There is also great entertainment in “The
Fortune of Christina McNab,” an obviously
British tale which proceeds to a conclusion
without causing any shortage in small-arm
ammunition.
* * !]J *
The best comic-opera plot of 1921:
The prologue ends with Danny Levy quitting the
Speaker’s chair of the N.S.W. Assembly, thus
making the parties 45 all. Then the play starts.
Unable to attract another of the Opposition to the
well-paid job, Dooley proposes Simon Hickey, one of
his own party, as Speaker, and being 1 down on the
first division goes to the Governor and asks for a
dissolution. His Ex. refuses, sends for Fuller,
requests him to form a Government and allows him
four days to do the job. Meanwhile government
is carried on by Dooley and his Ministers, pending
the appointment of his successors. On the evening
of the third day Fuller goes back to the Governor
and tells him he is unable to form a Government
that can carry on. Later in the evening Joe
Carruthers, Ted Simpson and two or three others
work overtime persuading Fuller that he can carry
on and show him how. Fuller decides to give it
a spin, and next morning rushes round early to
Government House and secures a withdrawal of the
towel he has thrown in. After lunch Fuller returns
to his Ex. with a team, says they are the new Mini-
sters and with them is sworn in. Then they march off
to meet the Assembly for the purpose of working off
the device propounded by Joe Carruthers and Ted
aforesaid. On the success of this device Fuller
counts upon being able to go back and advise the
Governor to dissolve the Assembly. Hickey
having resigned and restored the equilibrium in the
House the scheme is to demonstrate the existence of
a deadlock there by doing nothing for half-an-hour.
Then Danny Levy is to rise, again offer
himself as Speaker, and recite a carefully
prepared statement that he only does this
to ei d a deadlock and put the constitutional
machine into motion. Then, according to pre-
cedent, the House will adjourn for an hour while
Mr. Speaker proceeds to Government House and
announces his election —adding, of course, his little
bit about the 'deadlock. It is a dandy scheme.
If. it comes off his Ex. will have to listen to
advice from Fuller, who can with some justice then
say, “Parliament is impotent to carry on the King’s
business. I have caused a Speaker to be elected in
order to prevent the State being paralysed. I
advise you to fall back upon the Crown’s warrant
for Supply, pending an election, which should be
held at once. Dissolve the Assembly.”
But, as it happens, Fuller cannot put it to him.
The scheme falls to pieces as soon as Bagnall, one
of Fuller’s own men, lifts himself up, and denounces
the Ministry. That alters the ■ score to Dooley 46,
Fuller 44. Levy promptly recites his little bit,
nevertheless, and is rushed into the chair, and then
goes off, according to schedule, to see the Governor
and spin the yarn about the Assembly being at a
deadlock. But Bagnall goes with him; So, too,
do Dooley and others. When Davidson comes into
the reception room Levy tells his tale. But David-
son is made to hear the other side of the story, as
well; also Bagnall again publicly announces where
he stands. Dooley corroborates Bagnall’s denial of
a deadlock. The Governor, having gently remarked
that it is “usual on these occasions for Mr. Speaker
only to be heard,” dismisses the numerous depu-
tation. Then Fuller comes in and advises his Ex.
to grant him a dissolution. “Why?” asks Davidson.
“Because there is a deadlock.” “Can you secure the
Crown Supply?” next' asks his Ex. “No,” says
Fuller. “Why?” “Because I am in a minority of
one.” Fuller then repeats his request for- a dissolu-
tion —and the problem before the Governor is
whether, having refused his previous Premier a
dissolution when left one down, he should grant it
to a successor who has not up to then submitted
any business to the House, is in a minority to start
with and seeks the dissolution on the ground of a
deadlock which doesn’t clearly exist.
So he sends again for Dooley, and, Christmas being
now very near, Fuller allows Danny Levy to stay in
the chair, so that the cheques for salaries and so
on may be drawn, and the curtain falls with Dooley
in the middle of the stage, and Fuller looking un-
utterable things at Joe Carruthers and Ted Simpson.

Her Majesty’s, where “The Boy” reigns,
and the Criterion, where “Sinbad the Sailor”
lives and has his bottled stout after the show,
are Sydney’s brightest plaees of refuge from
the gloom produced by a season which ought
to be summer, but cvnically refuses to admit
it.

“Scandal,” which is mildly indecorous in
spots, still holds the fort at the Sydney
Palace, and passes, with the flapper who has
had her first oyster cocktail, for being enor-

comes along presently with Whalen in the
part that Frank Thornton made his own.
In a city of blizzards Sydney Tivoli offers
a comfortable haven where Wilkie Bard is at
the head of a frolicsome band of entertainers.
The gloom that arises from the knowledge
of this artist’s forthcoming departure is
somewdiat mitigated by his promise to return
in a year. Jock Thompson’s Scotch ballads
invariably get the loud encore; and new pre-
sentations include Barko, a comedy cartoon-
ist, and a pair of dueting warblers.

“Norbell”: Wonderful people, the police 1
We had opened a big show in Dunedin
under the J.C.W. oriflamme. Nellie Stewart
was the star, and George Musgrove was at
the helm. We toured an orchestra, too, and
the flautist was a rosy-cheeked, curly-headed
Dago youth named Spaghetti, or something
like that, who was a favorite with every-
body. One night Spag. didn’t turn up, and
the show had to struggle along without a
flute* Nobody seemed to know where little
Spag. was boarding, and everyone was con-
cerned at his non-appearance. Then Nellie
Stewart had a brain-wave. “I know he car-
ried £4O about with him, sewn in his vest —
he tbld me so. He’s been assaulted, robbed
and garrotted—perhaps murdered ! That’s
what’s happened. Nothing else would keep
him away.” So the C.I.D. and the uniform
police were telephoned to, but they unani-
mously failed to find the absentee. Next
morning was treasury, and at 11 o’clock
young Spaghetti, spick and span and smil-
ing, lined up with the rest of us. Musgrove
roared at! him in his inimitable style*'—“Where
the Vesuvius have you been? Why the
Pompeii weren’t you at work last night?'
and so on, for Muzzy had a genius for
pungent rebuke. Spag. smiled affably and
explained. “Oh, Mista Musgrove, you know
not how dronk I was las’ night! Igo to
the packa complete! An’ my ’ead to-day!
000-o-o-o! It is so crook, so terrible ! Mista.
Musgrove, you cannot understan’, no!”
“Perhaps I can,” said Muzzy with a twinkle,
and Spaghetti did not have his pay docked
for his hectic lapse. Four days later I was
in Princess-street with my wife, when I
noticed a John Hop eyeing me suspiciously.
Then he came and touched me on the shoul-
der. “ ’Scuse me, but you’re in th’ triat-
rical business, ain’t you?” I pleaded guilty.
“ ’Ere with Nellie Stewart, eli ?” I owned
up. “Well”—and there was a gleam of
professional pride in his eye—“you’d better
come longer me to th’ station!” “But why
on earth?” I demanded. “Been lookin’ f’r
you since larst week,” said the Law darkly
—“ain’t your name Spaghetti?” Then I
tumbled. The management had rung up
the police to tell of Spag.’s disappearance,
but had omitted to ring them down again.
I told the duty-smitten Hop where he could
find the dinkum absconder and moved on.

WE announced in the columns of this journal in January,
1920, the policy and importance of Australia
manufacturing her own commodities. Nineteen-
twenty to 1922 represents Australia’s greatest efforts and
advances towards becoming self supporting. Ahead of you
is the new year, with a still greater element of foreign

POINT
O.lv. : John Hare, who died last week,
was the last survivor but one of the company
that introduced the Robertson class of comedy
to the London stage, and so made theatrical
history. For "Society,” which seems so old-
fashioned to-day, was a sparkling novelty in
1565, and the whole future of drawing-room
or teacup-and-saucer.comedy was colored by
it. Until a few; months ago there were three
survivors of the original /t-Ast —the two Ban-
crofts, whose mdnager'iaß fortunes were
founded on the Robertson; plays, and young
John Hare, who nlayed the leading old man
in nearly all of thepi. . ' Mrs. Bancroft died
last wintef, and' l now Sir Squire Bancroft
alone remains to tell the tale of 1865. Hare,
though a clever artist, had so very unobtru-
sive a personality that he could lose himself
in anv sort of elderly-gentleman part before
he was 30 years of age. Thus, whilst other
actors were outliving their special line of
character —or, rather, growing too old for it —
John Hare had the advantage of growing up
to his; and by the time he came to play Gay
Lord Quex in his own theatre (where he had
already reigned for 23 years 1 he was only a
little older than the characters he specialised.
Knighted under his stage name, he figured
in ancient records as John Fairs. ~

—written the official account of the Prince’s
tour through the Dominion, turned out a
quartette of guide-books, edited the “Dominion

staff of Sydney Telegkaph.
“Minim”: Strange- indeed to hear of a
copy of Ivan Caryll’s “Lily of Leoville”
score turning up in Australia (B. 29/12/ 21)
Ihe opera was produced at the Comedy
-Ineatie, London, dO years or so ago, boomed
in advance as the first contribution to the
stage ot a young Belgian composer of
genius. Caryll (whose real nariie was Til-
lun) scored with his part of the work, but
was, like many another melodious confrere
unfortunate in regard to his librettist.’
Clement Scott, then dramatic critic of the
Daily Telegkaph and an aspiring play-
wright, had a hand in the “book,” and the
hand proved heavy. There was very little
nurnor about Scott, and so “The idly” early
faded out. But Caryll had been spotted
by Ceorsre Edwardes, who engaged him as
conductor the was one of the best) and
composer-m-chief for that establishment
where he remained many years.
“N.B ” : Some country theatres, where the
cloths (scenes) cannot be died (hoisted up
bodily), still retain the old-fashioned act-
™hlfhvlS rolled «P on a big, heavy
roller that lies on the stage when the rag
is down. More than once I’ve seen the
gills diesses caught as the scene went un

ing lady make an emphatic hit. She was
standing dead centre, facing the house, when

the curtain rose. Her long frock— they
wear ’em above their knees now, but then
the only thing they were above was reproach
" g°t caught in the roller. The rag went
up several feet, giving the delighted audi-
ence a full view of—many things. The lady
was hysterical. Turning to the unabashed
s.-m. she wailed, “George, you’ve shown the
audience my legs!” The gallant and experi-
man was equal to the occasion. “My
dear he cooed reassuringly, “they didn’t
see half enough of ’em !”
“Dido”: I am a warm admirer of the
Tempest-Browne pair, and hold that only
their excellent acting makes “Mr. I J im
t asses” an entertainment, but there is one
lault to be found with the Browne side of
the partnership, and that arises from his
apparent desire to be mistaken for a'
foreigner when articulating plain English
or what would be plain English if the actor
c.id not seek to set the audience disputing
as to whether he is a braid Scotsman or an
Anglo-German. Off the boards there is no
symptom of either Highland or Hun origin
m Browne’s tongue, but immediately he
steps out into the calcium glow his native
s P®® c h slips from him. and you get a be-
wildering suggestion of a cosmopolitan dia-
lect. Why will he do it?
W ymac” : One of the redeeming features
ol Sydney s panto, “Sinbad,” is the oppor-
tunity afforded Australian talent. In the
c .ast there is Rita Edmonds, a Manly
(JN.-.5.W.) girl, who, as a danseuse, shows
promise of filling Maggie Dickinson’s shoes;
Gracie Lavers, a Brisbane songster, is nrin-
cipal girl : and the “boy” is Eileen Cottey,
another Sydney girl, whose nether curves
compare favorably with the best imported.
“Nero”: “Hamfat” (B. 29/12/’2l) has
£? . ” 1S T ti y e . s uuxed. The piece which the
ivmght-Jeftries' Co. was rehearsing when
Julius was sickening for typhoid was “If
I Y\ ere King.” It was produced on the
Saturday night, and Knight WaS noticeably
all at sea. Nest day he was taken to hos-
pital, and on Monday Harry Plimmer read
the part The Cromwellian piece was “His
Majesty’s Servant”—a Lewis Waller oro-
daction m London. The Knight*Jeffries ~Co.
played it at Perth, and later ventured on
it at Melbourne Princess’s, but shelved it
almost as soon as it was out of the bag.
“Peter”: Despite its Ehglish setting I
suspect that. “Tea for Three” was built for
a tsew Yoik audience. Its author is a New
Yoiker, Itoi Cooper Megrue, two of whose
conspicuously American dramas, “Under
Cover and “Under Fire,” have already
been seen in Australia. Blit there is
further evidence in the fact that the
nasty, futile husband is a financial mag-
nate who would never be described by an
English dramatist as dealing, like this one,
in ‘real estate.” Moreover, his wife calls
him a “grouch,” and there is no such word in
the vocabulary of English people with all
income of £5OOO a year. Still, if Marie Tem-
pest and Graham Browne have translated
Megrim's play into English, they have done
their Work well. But they ought to sup-
press the shriek of the maid at the announce-
ment of a suicide in which she cannot be
personally interested. If an English Servant
made a noise like that she would get a
week’s notice.

“Nella”; “Hamfat’s” story of brutal

another incident in a George Rignoid pro-

how he had “run” Sir. William and Lady
Don at Bendigo. On the journey up they
passed through Forest Greek (Castlemaine),
toW how he had Waved his hand

“JeUne Premier”: We all have our troubles.
A London theatrical news-sheet announces the
publication of a new narrative poem, k Thespis
in Chains,’ ” which is described as “relating to
the theatre, disclosing systems and practices
that embitter the life and degrade the art of
.British actor and actress.” I don’t know
what the dreadful disclosures are. Maybe
they refer to the knighting of the leading
members of our noble calling.
“Minim” : At 76 Edward Lloyd, the sweet-
voiced, English tenor who toured Australia
many years ago, was recently married. The
bride was a widow—the wife of an old
musician friend of the singer, Clement Walter
Hann.
“Lend.”: An Amateur Players’ Associa-
tion has been formed, with a central club-
house in Buckingham Palace-road and 50
suburban-bodies behind it as a start. One
simple help promised is a register of parts
played by each person, so that a perform-
ance hit by illness or bereavement at the
11th hour can send along at short notice for
an experienced player to fill the gap. Louis
N. Parker, in opening the new clubhouse,
told the amateurs they must be pioneers,
and leave off their “slavish echoing of the
professional stage.” They ought to make,
or help in making, their own costumes and
scenery, do their own “producing,” and have
in view'the writing of plays too. At present
they are like cricketers unable to do anything
but bat. Parker added a practical hint,
from his own experience, in combating
h.c.1.., which hits most clubs so hard. As
an expert; in the production of the great
open-air historical “pageant” that England is
fond of, he has had about 20,000 real ama-
teurs under his hands. Their costumes, often
of great charm, cost on an average, he
reckoned, about four bob each; whereas the
stage amateur, requiring even a tramp’s
costume, gets it hired for a guinea the night,
at the ultimate expense, of course, of the
charity he is supposed to be assisting. The
great thing needed among amateurs is, in
Parker’s somewhat ambiguous phrase, “self-
sufficiency.”

“Liberty” : A well-intending Drama League
in Fork lias struck trouble over me
color-line. It has a praiseworthy habit of
banqueting, every season, the players who
have most obviously made a big stride up ih
the profession; and this time it simply
couldn’t omit Charles Gilpin, who created
the leading part iii the successful “Emperor
Jones.” But Gilpin is a man of color, and
the others refused to sit down to table with
him. Finally he gave them a lesson in. good
manners by announcing that he w r ould with-
draw the acceptance 1 and he was graciously
permitted—and actually consented —to at-
tend “informally” when the eatitig was over.
“Stargazer” : In the palmy days of melo-
drama one popular manager learned to so
dread the goat that nothing would ever
have induced him to stage one after his first
fatal attempt. It was in a farmyard scene.
Nanny had been offered with a certificate
of character, and there was no cause for
complaint till the manly hero took his be-
loved village maiden in his robust arms,
cuddled her to his chest and said : “My dar-
ling, I love you with an intensity words
cannot express.” “Bah!” said the goat,
“My sweet one, I have never loved before,”
“Bah-bah!” said the goat. “And I feel I
can never love again.” “Bah, bah-h-h-h!”
said the goat. By this time the audience
was roaring with raffish delight, and the
manager was dancing mad in the wing and
making ludicrous attempts to drag Nanny
out. “Down with the curtain!” he yelled,
and down it came. “I don’t mind honest
Criticism,” Said the management, “but this
I will not stand. Take her out and hang
her!” The censorious animal was removed,
but the audience spoilt the performance by
stopping the action, and clamoring for the
goat, when the sentiments seemed to call for
her interference.

“The clown! The clown!”
The youngsters cry, and toss on high
Their hats, and with their laughter drown
The playing bands. They clap their hands
To old Jo Brown.
He dances in,
And laughs and sighs, and blinks his eyes.
A thousand people sit and grin.
A weird grimace divides his face,
He wags his chin.
A mighty roar
Inflates the tent. Absurdly bent, ,
He hops across the ring once more,
And children then, and grave old men,
Stamp on the floor
And yell bravos.
Tears stain their cheeks. An ear he tweaks.
His white face shows a crimson nose,
And amblii g by with'antics sly
The jester goes. 'V
He trips and lies -
In antic pose. The audience shows
Delight in laughter and loud cries.
He is so quaint with patch and paint.
The people rise,
In joy they shed''
Their flowers down upon the clown.
But one goes nigh, and, lifts his head.
What matchless, art! ; New bravos start!

“And Chidley was an actor once.” —B. 29/12/ ’21.
Alone, unfriended, melancholy, slow,
You paced'‘old Pitt and George streets years ago;
Though small boys gibed, the wiser cits were mute,
Gazing in wonder at your two-piece suit,
And envying the while your costume free,
Bared head, bared limbs and cool audacity.
You were an author, so ’twas gravely said;
But though I never met a man who’d read
The one and only book you ever wrote,
To me, * who- sweltered in a buttoned coat
And pants to match on muggy days and dense,
You seemed the one and only man of sense!
Serene and unperturbed you went your way,
Showing less leg than half the town to-day.
There was no pose, no staginess. Sincere
You seerhed to me, you lonely pioneer!
But now, cold reason calls to me, “Oh dunce!
An actor always if an actor once!’’

SURE CATCH TACKLE
In Tattersall*s Carrington Stakes at Rand-
wick on Saturday, roughuns battled with outsiders
and the well-backed were nowhere. There were 23
at the barrier, including Speciality, Jack Findlay,
Coolstone, Maltgilla and Hopetoun. Teremarau and
Hopetoun were at the short end of the market.
Galtee Maid fled away with a three-lengths’ break,
pursued by Yolpi, Woodville, Teremarau and Curra-
ween. At the distance Curraween and Woodville
punctured, and the other two closed on the leader.
R. KELLY
MAITLAND, the
Vic. racing identity.
Etive swung into the
proceedings a hundred
yards from home. She
was near the middle
of the course, Volpi
being close to Galtee
Maid, who was on the
rails. At this stage
"Volpi, steered by
O’Bryan, suddenly left
his line and, almost
lying on top of Etive,
went on to win by a
long head. As the per-
formance was staged
under the noses of
about 40 thousand
people, the stipes
handed the race to the
much-hampered Etive.
Galtee Maid was a
close third, Teremarau
fourth, and Hopetoun,
who came from the
the clouds, next. The
same calamity hap-
pened to William
Booth, Volpi’s trainer,
four years ago, when
Chanteroerle, having
won the Summer Cup,
was on a protest for
interference placed
second to Poitrel.
Volpi and Etive are both by The Welkin, and as
two-ytar-olds were very smart. But Volpi, though
an exceptionally quick beginner and a great track
galloper, has always evinced a tendency to chuck it.
On Saturday he started at 100’s to 6 and 7. Etive
is one of the best gallopers at Randwick. Before
the Epsom she was backed to win a hatful by her
then owner, Barney Allen, but he sold her, and she
is now trained by Joseph Burton, who held optimistic
.views about her chances in the Villiers. She went
out on Saturday at 100’s to 5. Her rider was the
apprentice Chevally, son of the crack cross-country
rider of a couple of decades ago.
The Booth stable was compensated during the
day with two genuine winners. Bronzicllet, a plain
but useful-looking son of Bronzino, took the Chelms-
ford Handicap, and Trimacre (a daughter of Cooltrim
and Eulacre) annexed the Juvenile Stakes from the
red-hot favorite Myosotis.
No gamer mare than Julia Grey has raced in Syd-
ney for a long time, and on Monday she won her
richest stake —Tattersall’s Cup. She seemed to like
the pouring rain and sodden track, for, after running
in the first flight for a mile, she went to the front
at the four furlong post and staved there. Carbern,
now six years old, who in his third year won the A..T.C.
Rous Handicap and Winter Stakes, but has done
nothing since except encourage punters to profanity,
was next, and Burton’s promising colt Bitalli fin-
ished third. Julia was at 16’s, Carbern at 12’s, and
Bitalli at s’s. The winner, now five years old, first
came into notice by annexing a sprint' for novices at
Rosehill, and two months later she took the A.J.C.
June Stakes from a first-class field. In the next
Spring she was in a fortnight twice second (once
to Beauford) and once third at Randwick. Since
then she has won over all distances from six fur-
longs to 12. Last season she started 19 times; and
on r ”4vrW PreS n lt ?, n n She has been raeed continuously
y t M , elbout ; ne tracks. She was first
i . the straight behind Beauford in last Epsom
finishing a close fourth, and two days later 1 was
pulled out for the Metrop. Julia was not raced at
tW< \/ e^i S olt ' At tbat a S e Carbern, second to her
on Monday, was started 14 times.
S ail On’s sick showing in the Summer Cup
a "f f, handsome win in the Villiers Stakes sug-
gests that he is every inch a Tressadv. The off-
spring of unhonored Tressady are a horribly uncer-
qwhvS * hougb not .invariably such take-uowns as
otrathi edole. They inherit cunning from the old
man, seemingly.
* * * *
Although only one actual favorite got home
at Fiemmgton on Monday, backers had a fairly
prohtable time, as all the winners were well backed.
Whiz Bang, second favorite at B’s with Green Malt,
won the Standish Handicap from Grey Abbey, who
was at the head of the quotations, and the
comparative outsider Lisnavane. The Bagot pro-
vided further evidence that the owners of Violon-
cello and Sister Olive were lucky that Stare wasn’t
nominated for the two Cups. Weighted at Bst.
101 b., a tidy burden for a three-year-old, the Earl-
sfon.. V aze anc^e d the stake and several sub-
n antial wagers at 6’s and s’s for his owner Eccles,
after a fine race with Bright Plume, the favorite,
Miss Pinkerton, filling the other place.
* * * *
The St. Anton-Speedite gelding St. Speed,
who created a new State record —59secs.—for five
furlongs on Boxing Day at Port Adelaide, followed
it up on Saturday by making new figures for six
furlongs in the Colonel Light Handicap on the first
day of the S.A.J.C.’s meeting at Morphettville,
running the distance in lmin: 12sec. The St. Leonards
Handicap for two-year-olds went to Anton King, who
was runner up to the Cyklqn gelding Guillemot in
the Commemoration Handicap. St. Speed added
another sprint to his record by running away with
the Marino Handicap (6f.) on the concluding dav.
The Trafalgar mare Annexit and Golden Cock made
the New Year Gift somewhat of a procession,
as the daughter of Miss Mayfair was five-and-a-half
lengths clear of Golden Cock, who, in turn was
seven lengths away from the third horse. In the
Seacliff Handicap for three-year-olds Pistol Lad
wo " easily. He, however, dropped his weight cloth
and was given to Cultana, by Pendil.
There was no mud for Rappel King to
revel in for the Goodwood Handicap at the Banana-
land T. C. s final day’s racing, and, accordingly,
Ercaml’s backers got some of the money back they
lost on the first day. Lady Achilles was favorite
and again ran second. She was saddled up once
more in the Eagle Farm Handicap, but lost by a
short head to Gritcha, by Syce. The Midsummer
Handicap lacked interest owing to the absence of Fairy
Bob. The two horses that ran behind him in the
Newmarket—Penstimon, by Sands of the Orient, and
Armacre—were placed first and third. Dudleigh,
whose close second to Glory Box on the first day
brought about an inquiry by the “stipes/’ left four
lengths of daylight between himself and the Orange
Blossom filly in the Two-Year-Old Handicap. The
Lily veil—-Fortune’s Wheel gelding was a short favo-
rite, while Glory Box went out at 6’s.
By adding the> All-Aged Stakes to his list
of victories and leaving the seven furlongs behind in
lmin. 25 4-ssec., Easingwold heaped further con-
fusion on those Melbourne critics who had hastily
declared him a dud. But the Eaton Lad—Bahloo
flier failed to see out a strongly-run two miles in
the Perth Cup. That handsome prize fell to the
consistent Earl of Seafield, by Duke Humphrey—-
Bessie Balcombe, who had finished second in the
Railway Stakes, two days before, to the imported
nag Fair Intervener, a 7-to-2 chance, and was runner-
up in last year’s Cup. Carrying 7st. 41b. and going out
second favorite at 9 to 2, the locally-bred five-year-old
convincingly accounted for the Victorian mare Queen
Comedy (Bst. 21b.), Gold Digger (7st. 11b.) and a
field of fair quality in 3min. 26 4-ssec. As a young-
ster the Earl was a stable-mate of Eurythmic, but
was never within stones of the champion’s form.

Jerry Monohan, of Ireland, engaged that
faithful fistic hack Jamito at Sydney Stadium
on Saturday night. Monohan looked half a stone
heavier than the Filipino, whose weight was given
as 9st. 21b. Jamito forced the fighting throughout,
while the exile stalled ; and with that virtually the
whole history of the engagement is told. Monohan’s
occasional refresher, from a champagne bottle,
indicated that his condition was not of the best;
but no such handicap afflicted his leather-hued
opponent, who was going more furiously in the last
round than at any stage of the proceedings. Joe
Wallis gave it a draw amidst hoots from those who
had laid odds on Jamito. The others reckoned it
was a sound decision. Monohan is a fine, defensive
fighter, with a snappy little punch in either hand
that should become formidable when he gets accli-
matised.
Another Filipino made his bow on Monday
night. Domingo—-who had given one of the pretti-
est exhibitions of skipping ever seen in Sydney, as
a “preliminary” on the previous Saturday—is a mild-
looking yellow lad, with an expansive smile, who
holds the title of feather-weight champion of his
native isles. To him came Les Waters, a local
dark horse. In the first round Domingo dropped
Waters with a right uppercut which whistled up
from the neighborhood of the floor. Surprised, but
still captain of his senses, the smitten youth re-
sumed after seven seconds on his back, and in the
next round he dropped Domingo. From then on-
wards till the eighth, in which the fight was stopped,
the Australian beat the game little islander in every
round. Domingo (7st. 6;]lb.) was giving away over
half a stone.

King, the likely-looking young Vic. middle-
weight, had Les Kemp to practise on at Melbourne
Stadium on Saturday night. Kemp went five rounds
and then retired amidst the cordial execrations of
the populace. He was below par in the matter
of condition* but at his best he would have been
pio” for Ring.

Frank Burns is off to try his luck in
Europe next week. Bums is a crude-looking cus-
tomer in the ring, and no doubt has still much to
learn. But that he is a good deal more knowledgeable
than his awkward methods would suggest has been
proved by his destruction first of Tommy Uren and
then of Jimmy Clabby. He is going abroad because
his native land offers him no more middles to
conquer.
N.S.W. Motor-cycle Club’s six-days’ relia-
bility trial was cut down last week from 820 to
750 miles. A matter of the weather. Of the 13
cars to finish only 11. Hulford (34-h.p. Douglas),
in the solo class, and A. J. Dennis (7-n.p. Indian
P. Williams (7-h.p. Excelsior) and J. Mills (7-h.p.
Harley-Davidson), with side-cars, got through with-
out loss of points.

Dora Lewis, aged 17, did 50yds. in 29sec.
at the Spit Paths (Sydney) on Saturday. Fanny
Durack’s world’s best for the distance is 27secs., put
up at the Domain enclosure in 1914 when she was
at her top. Miss Lewis is a splendidly built athlete,
uses the American continuous crawl stroke and is
improving with every swim. At the same gathering
K. Burns (15 years) covered the 50 in 25 2-ssecs.
(which is only 2 4-ssec. outside Duke Kahanamoku’s
world’s record), and J. Brooks (16) and M. Camp-
bell (13) achieved 26secs. flat. Keith Kirkland, tne
Spit Club’s Olympic rep., just shattered the minute
over 100yds.

The Aussies fielded a side of misfits for
the Widnes match, which they won by 17 points
to 8. Horder was custodian during the first canto,
Fraser went to centre, as also did Laing, the Maori-
land five-eighth. Craig, usually a centre or winger,
was .placed behind the pack. Norman, Pearce, Burge,
Watkins, Latta, Thompson and Johnston were un-
available. Johnson, the Widnes international for-
ward, and Gregory, one of the home NIII’s best, had
to retire hurt, leaving the Lancastrians with but
11 men, which may have had something to do with
the visitors’ victory. On Saturday the match was
against Halifax, last season’s winners of the York-
shire League Cup, and leaders to date for the North-
ern League Cup. The Australians won by 35 points
to 6. Laing, the Maoriland half and three-quarter,
bucked in with the ruckers. Fraser returned to his
job ■as custodian ; Craig doubled up with Thompson,
behind the scrum; and Caples went to the centre.
Blinkhorn notched three great tries, and Craig
landed the goals, which included a clever pot from
the field. The Aussies have now played 31 games;
won 24, lost 7, and totalled 698 points to their
opponents’ 194. The third and final Test is listed for
next Saturday.
The only sailing fixture decided on Port
Jackson last Saturday was the combined club’s handi-
cap. Twenty-two 16-footers faced the starter in a
howling sou’-easter. Ibis lost her stick, and Thistle
her bumpkin; and whilst endeavoring to stow their
balloohers and haul a wind at the first mark off
Sow and Pigs, Olympic, Forby and Admiral Du-
maresq’s Furore capsized. Later on Dart (P. Mills)
lost a hand overboard, but soon picked him up, got
going again, and won with 2min. to spare from
Winona, 7imin. (J. Clare).
The big race at the Pittwater (N.S.W.)
Regatta last Saturday was the All-Yachts’ Handicap,
over a 174-mile course. It went to Oenone (J. M.
Brunton), 33min., with the old Maoriland-built Bona,
Smin. (Len. Patrick), second. The winner of the
21ft. restricted class scratch race —the G.-G.’s
Corella—-was well handled by Don Taylor. This
was Lord Forster’s first success in Ma State waters.
The third boat, Jimmy Alderton’s Gumleaf, has got
a place in every race she has contested since being
launched. Ten started in the cruisers’ 114-mile
event for barges on the registers of S.A.S.C.,
R.P.A.Y.C. and R.S.Y.S., which fell to Sea Belle.

No club went through the preliminary
rounds of Sydney grade cricket undefeated, although
’Varsity, Norths, Paddington and Marrickville were
next door to it. Saturday’s play concluded the
seventh round after a fortnight’s break. A
sodden wicket helped Ironmonger and Kermode
to provide the star turn of the afternoon,
and gain Balmain an outright win from Cum-
berland. The left-hander’s figures were 4 for 19 and
5 for 20, and the old Moore Parkian’s 6 for 40 and
3 for 31. Gar Waddv (13 and 23) did most towards
the orchardists’ 118. Waverley responded feebly
to Randwick’s 311. Five Boneya.rders lost their
lives to Shea, who had only 33 runs scored off him.
Dr. Poidevin hit up 31 out of the 84 contributed.
His side followed on, but were in possession at the
end with two down for 131. Caswell showed sound
defence for 69 n.o. Trenerry was very tricky and almost
unplayable for Paddington against North Sydney.
He got five ’Shoremen for 38, but Pratten, who
knocked up 74, was missed off him more than once.
Norths lost by 66 runs on the first innings. Marrick-
ville were the only team hatting on the day to pass
their opponents’ previous Saturday’s score. However,
they had to scratch to get six runs more than St.
George’s moderate 193. Fox (6 for 66) did not bowl
with the best of luck, although he controlled his
break well. Mosman, having already gained a first-
innings win against Manlv. tried for an outright
but just failed. The Bayites started the day by
going for the howling and totting up 3 for 222 and
“declaring.” Chapman (79), with Rowland, Ander-
son and Bull, all in the forties, completely put the
wind up the Village leather-hunters. Gee (621. in
Manly’s second knock, saved the situation. Clem-
enger (6 for 50), for Wests, had the ’Varsity batsmen
guessing all the time, and Freeman (4 for 28) also
howled well. Uni. lost on the first innings. In
Wests’ second knock ’keeper Jagelman got three of
the four wickets that fell, and McKew, the Sun-
downers’ juggler, was also in his best form. Sydney
failed to reach Gordon’s 260, although the side
batted well. Laurie, for- Gordon, took 6 for 64, and
troubled all except N. Cohen, whose 46 was an especi-
ally fine effort. Gordon made a bid for a four-
point win. Petersham went after Glebe’s scalp, but
in the ex-butchers’ second attempt Kelleway’s bat
seemed as big as a door, and his 53 n.o. spoilt their
game. Long, of Petersham, howled a flighty ball
with a good length, and took 7 wickets for 32.
There were some striking bowling averages
in the inter-State junior cricket game at Sydney
last week, which Vic. won by 79 runs. G. Middle-
ton (Victoria), a right-hander who turned the ball
each way, got 13 for 43. For N.S.W., Frank Whitty,
a tall right-hander and brother of the inter-State
left-hander, kept a fine length, and took 8 for 62 ;
and H. Bonamy, a promising left-hander, 5 for 35.
Despite the big score there was nothing
spectacular in Vic.’s opening against South Aus. in
Melbourne on Saturday. Ryder, who finished the dav
,! lc f? re at innings of 232 n.o. out of a total, of
38s for 3 wickets, drove vigorouslv for most of the
time, scoring frequently off his favorite on shot,
though he earned singles for many hits, which, if
better placed, would have been certain fours. Park,
n J el V°m 39, cau §' ht expertly in the slips by Prit-
cnard oft Townsend, never shaped like himself, and
“f e w , heri Ambler missed him at the wickets.
Willis played confidently for his 44, and his worst
stroke was his weak scoop into the hands of Loveridge
that sent him back to the pavilion. Lampard, usually
a consistent scorer, reigned for about five minutes,
being snapped up at the wickets for 1. Ransford,
who kept his end up to the finish with 68 to his name,
gave the prettiest display, though he was apparently
DR. ROY PARK
(Victoria), who
scored 122 against
N. S. Wales.
unwell __ and frequently
rested. He made some ex-
cellent back cuts—clean,
lightning strokes that are
conspicuously absent from
Ryder’s repertoire. The
S. Australian bowling
ranged from mediocre to
feeble. Whitty, the old
international, who pro-
trudes too much now in
the waistband, was never
dangerous on that perfect
wicket. A. Richardson,
who got 2 for 83, kept
a decent length, but none
of the others, who mostly
pitched up innocent slows
for a field which spread
out fanwise in the country,
troubled the batsmen to
any extent. The fielding,
however, was excellent. V.
Richardson and the
younger Pellew (his big
brother remained in South
Aus.) were always a joy
to watch.
“Bill R.” ; Playing with a Lake Bathurst
(N.S.W.) team this season against a Spring Valley
XI, Fred Tickner scored 104. His brother Lin,
though lamed 0.A.5., got 39 and “kept" efficiently,
and their father, Peter Tickner, carried out his bat
for 57 and then bowled six of the enemy.

The Australasian A. A. championships at
Adelaide (S. Aus.) on Saturday attracted represents-
tives from N.S.W., M.L., South Aus. and South
Africa. Of the eight titles only two were won by
holders. The Sydney ’Varsity athlete, R. J. Ilonnor,
took the broad jump with 23ft. 81in. (an Austral-
asian record which displaces Mat Roseingrave’s 23ft.
put up nearly 20 years ago) ; while G. R.
Parker .(N.S.W.) easily won the three-mile walk
in 23min. 4 2-ssec., . the fourth slowest time since
1893. “Slip” Carr is credited with beating evens
m the 100yds., in which he downed the S’African
H. P. Kinsman. However, as he also beat the gun the
figures'will not go into the book. A. W. Reid (N.S.W.)
hurled the javelin 173 ft. displacing E. Suther-
land’s 172 ft. 1 3-16 in., at last M.L. championships.
The mile was spectacular, and the brilliant J. New-
man (Vic.) showed rare grit in defeating H. S.
Grandemange (N.S.W.) by inches in 4min. 35 l-ssec.
But the time is a long way behind G. A. Wheatley’s
4min. 23sec. in 1905. L. F. Edmunds (Vic.)
won the 120yds. hurdles in 15 3-10 sec., which has
only once been bettered (G. Keddell’s 15 2-ssec. in
1911) ; and L. H. Rouse (Vic.) had an easy
task in the 161 b. shot putt with 38ft. 2in.
On Monday Carr took the 220yds. in 21Jsec. Aus-
tralasia’s previous best was W. A. Woodger’s (M.L.)
21 4-ssec. The world’s best (21 l-ssec.). is held by
three Yankee fliers. Roy Harbison (N.S.W.) cleared
sft. lOJin. in the high jump—an effort which has
only once been bettered here, when L. H. Kelly put
up 6ft. 0 3-Bin. in 1914. The Springboks were dead
out of form, owing to their three weeks at sea, and
their only success was in the mile club relay. They
defeated N.S.W. here in 3min. 30 4-5 sec. The final
points aggregates were: N.S.W. 10, Victoria 5, and
M.L. 3.

Coombes and Marks have been, as usual
reappointed president - and secretary of the Amateur
Athletic Union. The former said he was willing to
keep on, having been “the man who called the'first
meeting," somewhere about 1896; but Marks said
that this must be his last term, as he is giving up
a number of engagements. The Union, sitting in
conference in Adelaide, was about to “deal with"
a State more than six months behind with its sub-
scription, contrary to the rules, when Gordon Camp-
bell, chairman of the local A.A.A., pointed out that,
though the one on the carpet was three years in
arrears, yet all the States were at least 12 months to
? he , bad, and so, presumably, incapable of sitting
in judgment. “I give it up,” said Coombes; “we’d
better get a lawyer of high standing to advise us
just where we are.” The visitor was promptlv
informed that that is . just what Campbell is.
The first round of the County of Cumber-
land tennis carnival at Ashfield (Sydney) last week
saw the defeat in the doubles (8 —6, o—6, 6—4) of
Jim and Clarence Anderson (holders) by the youth-
ful brothers E. H. and G. Munro. It was Jim An-
derson’s first game since his return from the Davis
Cup matches, and he showed much improvement,
especially in placing and cross-court play. His
smashing was also brilliant. But his partner wasn’t
good enough. The Munros crashed in the second
round to S. Spratt and J. O’Ryan in straight sets.
No Sydney bowler was better known than
F. G. Crouch, the “Mr. Pickwick” of the Randwick
Club, and an old-time M.L.A. for a Northern Rivers
constituency. He lived a full life, made hosts of
friends, and died last week, widely regretted.
“Airey”: Nahum (chap. II) seems to have
been the first of the prophets to foretell Ford and
the Rolls Royce: “The chariots shall rage in the
streets, they shall jostle against another in the
broadways; they shall seem like torches and they
shall run like lightnings."

I’m only an ’umble fighting man, but I come of the
bulldog breed,
And though I don’t draw no color line, yet I still
have my sporting creed.
I’ll battle with brindle, white or black, with a
Methody, Tyke or Yid ;
But curse me if I fight a man as trains in a comb
instead of a lid.
I’ve seen some frightful things in the ring, such as
bath-robes like Harry Stone’s,
And emerald pants, and outsize flags, which won
for their wearers groans.
But never ’ave I ’opped through the ropes (and, by
crikey, I never shall!)'
To tackle a dashed salaaming cow with ’is hair
done up like a gal.
So ’ere’s my larst to the Boxing Club (though the
loss of the money ’urts),
They’ll not match me with a Cingalee, for I won’t
fight a cove in skirts.

The Magic Wand of
the Metal Industries!
It is not long since scrap heaps were an accepted part of
production wherever machinery was used, but to-day very
few worn or broken machinery parts or workshop tools
are discarded. Comox (Oxy-Acetylene) Welders, dotted
throughout Australia, make these broken articles strong as
new for a trifling sum.
Innumerable metal articles, now in common use, were
unheard of a few years ago, because no process existed to
make them available at a reasonable price. Many opera-
tions in metal manufacturing industries that hitherto were
impossible have now been reduced to simplicity by the
powerful Oxy-Acetylene flame.
If you are an engineer or manufacturer of metal goods,
Comox (Oxy-Acetylene) Welding will enable you to pro-
duce a better article in a fraction of the time at a frac-
tion of the price. If you are a repair man, a Comox Weld-
ing Plant enables you to do more business. If you are
merely a man in trouble due to the breakage of some
machinery part or metal household article, Comox Welding
will help you, as it helps others.
Ask us for (a) name of nearest Comox Welder, (b) par-
ticulars of Comox Welding Plants.

Our Earl and liis Countess are devoted
admirers of Marie Tempest, and frequent
the King s while the sprightly little .English-
woman is there. One holiday night the
Countess appeared in her box in a brilliant
flame-colored velvet, and her husband had a
washing-day line of medals and things.on his
chest. Lady Helena Rous kept to the back-
ground with a couple of aides, and peered
through her big round spectacles. In spite
of the brilliancy of the Coiuitess’s own
frocking she probably shared the envy of the
house over Marie Tempest’s dresses
in Tea for Three.” The curtain goes up
°?i ne lr ! a buttercup frock of the ador-
able broderie Anglaise, as the French call
our old-fashioned buttonholed muslin. In
another scene her frock is distinctly crino-
line. Imagine brown chiffon velvet pleated
oyer a crinoline and flattened out on the
pleats with pale-gold roses! The swish of
her skirt disclosed a silver-lace petticioat
with jade-green fringes, and the eyes of the
house positively goggled over its splendor,
lhe play runs round some silver foxskins
‘without a hint of red in them,” and Miss
lempest wears one of these on a jade-green
velvet cloak. The pampered lady also gets
into a tea-gown which is a sheer georgette,
cape over bare shoulders, and Weighed
down with heavy silver lace. For a dramatic
flit from her house in this tea-gown the
maid gives her an enveloping coat of silver-
giey lined with dull purple. Altogether
Marie Tempest is a Frock Revue in' her-
self throughout the play. She lias the foil
of two dainty parlor-maids in grey and the
dull tailorings of the two men—her lover
and her husband.
The Fullers gave over the entire house, at
both the Princess’s and the Palace, to the
widows and children of Diggers, so that they
might see full-dress rehearsals of “Bluebeard”
and The Babes in the Wood.” Every inch
of both theatres was crammed with delighted
children, with a mother to each trio or so of
infants. Souvenir programmes were handed
out with sweets for the youngsters, and
manager Muller worked overtime looking
after the army of guests. The “Bluebeard”
settings follow some of the finest illustrations
that have appeared in “Bluebeard” books. The
blood-curdling gentleman himself is exactly
what every child has imagined him—a gor-
geous ogre in wonderful Oriental garb of silk,
crowned with a jewelled hat and hung with
delphinium-blue whiskers and a monstrous
bunch of keys. The Fullers are running
five pantomimes simultaneously—two in Mel-
bourne, two in Sydney and one in Auck-
land. Queerly enough, the Melbourne shows
have their stages back to back, as the Prin-
cess property in Spring-street reaches to
the Palace in Bourke-street.
Norah Delaney, the Real-Lady panto boy,
put up a turn of her own last week by going
to sleep and not waking in time for the
show. Norah had taken a headache drug
which worked overtime, and it took Dr.
Barry Thompson, in the part of Prince
Charming, an hour to bring her back to
earth.
Bishopscourt, the episcopal home in Clar-
endon-street, is being furbished up for Arch-
gaiters Harrington Lees and his dame. The
place is ancient at one end and strikingly
modern at the other. The older portion is
of bluestone with cement dressings, and the
newer of red brick and rough-cast, with
gables and tiled roof. It was offered, but
not accepted, as a shack for Gov. Strad-
broke. There is ample lawn space and a
misshapen gum-tree, aged anything up to 90,
but very shady and a sheer delight to young-
sters. From the first-floor windows the
whole of the Fitzroy Gardens, now fenceless,
look like an outer park of the palace. Of
course it is not nearly so line as Raheen,
Ivew, where Somebody Else, also called “Your
Grace,” lives, but it is close to the city and
just the distance for a walk after breakfast.
A few days ago, at the invitation of the
Education Department, Dr. Garnet Leary
went to the High School and talked inter-
estingly and helpfully on stammering and
its causes. About 100 children with speech
defects, including a few Bell-street boys, and
several shell-shock patients who are afflicted
with temporary stammering were among the
listeners. The doctor, who himself was once
among the afflicted, insists that stammering
is not the result of nervousness, but that the
nervousness is the result of defective speech.
He finds that rhythm has much to do with
cure. Breathing exercises, a sympathetic sug-
gestion to relax strained muscles and the
practice of balanced rhythm in speech is at
the /root of the treatment. He gave an in-
teresting demonstration with shell-shock
patients in various stages of treatment.
Director of Education Tate promises further
demonstrations in the new year, with special
ones for teachers and classes for stammer-
ing youngsters. The whole endeavor deserves
many cheers.
Sassiety is trekking to Queenscliff and Sor-
rento. Lucky folk who have summer homes
there, are packed with house guests, who
promised beforehand to do anything, from
cooking to dusting, during the Mary. Aimless
season. The hotels are full and spilling
out on the verandahs, while latecomers clam-
orously offer to pay many paper sovereigns
for the privilege of sleeping in a bath. One
pathetic ad. appeared in the dailies:—
Young man wants any room, anywhere, any terms
at Queenscliff.
Probably his nicest girl was there with pa
and ma, and a rival was somewhere in the
offing.
Captain Arthur Holme has been wel-
comed and entertained by old Melbourne
friends while flitting through with his old
boat, the Suevic. A peaceable enough craft
these days; but she saw high adventure dur-
ing the war. Holme took her on some
weirdly dangerous runs and dodged Fritz’s
torpedoes while carrying food from Canada
to the Belgians in the early part of the war.
The Croix de Guerre and a Leopold decora-
tion were unloaded upon him along with
letters of appreciation from various Im-
portants. Then the vessel was wrecked—
cut clean in halves. The disaster happened
one stormy midnight, but all aboard. were
packed off to safety without panic, and
even their baggage was rescued. But the
old ship lived in sp;te of her disembowel-
ment, and is so neatly clamped together
now that there is no possibility of her be-
coming unstuck. Captain Holme, though
badly shell-shocked before the end of the
war, looks a healthy convalescent these days.
This is how Broothorn pictures clever
little pianist Lilian Ford, daughter of
actor Johnnie Ford,
who has made a
success of arranging
musical programmes.
She also owns a
good soprano voice,
which was trained
in the way it should
go by the late Armes
Beaumont. The little
lady is gifted with
a rich streak of
humor, doubtless in-
herited from her
mumming clad, which
gives a touch of
originality to her'
work. Incidentally,
when you are con-
sidering the Lilies,
this one must not be
confused with'that other of identical name
whose musical fingers turn on taps of me'lodv
at a St. Kilda show.
Anne AVillia'ms, the voice expert of the
Eastern Hill 'Con., is off to Condon for a
few months. She has turned many a noL
able voice into the path it should go. One
of her pupils, Gertrude Johnson, who is
forging ahead in London, will make her
debut soon at Covent Garden, and Anne will
be there to criticise.
The head of that Presbyterian Ladies’*
College who the other day complained that
education had become too un-utilitarian
should have been there when a school-teacher
friend held up her class for a minute while
she examined what Amelia May was read-
ing under her desk. Amelia Mav is 12, and
the' book was “How Girls Go Wrong- The
True Story of the White Slave Traffic.”
Neil Kilby is down on leave from Itabaul,
lording it in a Lister House* flat. Mel-
bourne had scarcely realised his departure
for the Northern possession when he turned
up again. ’Kilby- is the beautiful young-
man who was, wont to he called in as. extra
aide in Guv’ment House’s stressful times.
He lias an aviator’s uniform that always
achieved a .killing effect.
\oung Theyre Weigall, the K.C.’s adven-
turous son and heir, who side-tracked a pros-
pective ’Varsity course to see the big world
from the viewpoint of a ship’s steward, has
got back from his travels and planted his
feet on the Inky Way as a Herald cub. The
Weigall family has a liking for doing things
thoroughly. The K.C. himself has a pretty
turn for writing in prose and verse, and his
wife, who is the daughter of a former Apple
Island Governor, plays the piano with a pro-
fessional touch. Daughter Marion is seek-
ing to reinforce her local ’Varsity degree
with a French diploma, and the youngest,
artist Joan, is learning more about the way
to use paint and pencil in Paris.
The Theyre Weigalls’ artist daughter Joan,
who lately unpacked her landscape painting-
box in an Old-World studio, has further com-
mitted herself to an artistic career by promis-
ing to marry into the Lindsay family. Daryll,
the youngest of Norman’s brothers, is the
lucky Lindsay.
J. J. Hall, pictured here by Broothorn,
as a regular thing disciplines the young
mind at Grimwade House, the Melbourne
•Grammar Prep., but as a side-line he is
making increasingly-frequent excursions along
the Inky Way. Last year he struck suc-
cess with a volume of Australian children’s
tales called “Winks”; and now “The Crys-
tal Bowl,” a collec-
tion of Australian
nature stories for
kiddies, illustrated by
Dorothy W a 1b

the other as a seller.
Originally the peda-
gogic penman delved
into matters con-
cerning primary edu-
cation, and revised

When the Huns
started out to own
the world he dived
into a suit of khaki
and did - his bit in
the big rumpus.
Tom I arker, the only one of that name
now m the firm of Huddart Parker, and one
ot Melbourne’s most eligible bachelors, has
.lust persuaded pretty Phyllis Mac William,
ot Darling Point, Sydney, to accept the usual
emblem. He is the son of the late E. T.
1 arker, and Phyllis, who has barely reached
her 20th milestone, is the elder daughter
of I etei Mac William, one of N.S.W.’s woollv
people.
The late T. B. Lewers’s handsome widow
has been tempted to try a second course of
matrimony, this time with Mr. McMillan, a
local banker. With her new husband she gets
a quintette of step-children.
Miss Isabell Carlyon gives emphatic denial
to the suggestion that her dad is thinking of
marrying again. “There is absolutely no
truth in the rumor,” she says.
Florence Deasey, who did heroic service
when she was matron at the Exhibition
emergency hospital during the big influenza
epidemic, has nursed her last patient. A
mound was heaped over her in Brighton
Cemetery at Ohristmastide.
Like 'Father Sullivan. Rector of Xavier’s,
Father John Bourke, the new rector of St.
Pat’s, is a native of the State. As second
in command at Kew, Father Bourke has
been well broken in for his new job. Father
Boylan, the retiring head of St. Pat.’s, was
one of the 1 best liked of the masters at
Xavier when he was there. No boy in a.
scrape dreaded going to him. He was eter-
nally engaged pulling them out of ruts and
puddles and setting them on the track.
English cricket-captain Douglas’s dad and
mum and two sporting sisters are in Mel-
bourne. Or, rather, at time of writing, at
St. Kilda, putting up at the Esplanade.
Alberto Zelman, who postponed his depar-
ture for England under the flattering per-
suasion of Melba, leaves on January 28. tie
will be working with Dame Nellie till the
last moment —even at a matinee on the day
of sailing.
After much cogitation Speaker Mackey has
suspended Sergeant-at-Arms J. M. Worthing-
ton from duty, and has reported him to the
Loyernor-in-Council as “guilty of conduct
which renders him unfit to continue in the
I üblic Service.” The words quoted are a
formula taken from Section 412 of the Con-
stitution Act Amendment Act, and the “con-
duct referred to is the war-bonds charge on
which he was tried three times in the Crimi-
nal. Court and eventually acquitted. A board
of inquiry will follow and on its recommen-
dation will depend whether Worthington will
be cleared, reprimanded, reduced in status,
transferred, or told that the world is wide.
. John Moiloy has thrown up his £750-a-year
Job as secretary and inspector of the Neg-
lected Children’s ~ Department. After being
the State s expert on electoral matters for
many years he took over the neglected chil-
dren and prompted the passing of some
humane legislation; but he found the work
worrying, especially the control of the im-
possible Royal Park, depot, which is a sort
of children’s hospital, creche and workhouse.
Even there he effected some reforms, how-
ever, and brought down the death-rate. Rut
he shattered his health, and the death of his
wife didn’t help his recovery. So a man
who seemed sound enough to last till the
retiring age of 65 is going out at 54. Ilis
rose-growing hobby may help to sweeten his
retirement.
Gilbert Walsh, who was lately absent from
the King’s Theatre on other business for the
Taits, is again the brethren’s manager at the
old stand and collects their share of the gate
from the effusive domestic drama, “Tea for
Three.” Gilbert, whose golden locks have
flamed in front of many a theatre in Australia
and abroad, was married a while back to a
bright little lady, Violet Elian.
The Frolics of 1922 got in early at the
Tivoli —a week before Christmas. There isn’t
much frock, but what there is of it is pastel-
tinted and weighted With pale gold. The chorus
and ballet wear glorified pyjamas in bril-
liant satins of dull tones for a background,
and the crack jazz pair—who show the
newest steps—descend to the stage in a
lamp-shade of pale amber georgette.
It’s still true that, in spite of a dozen
“society” papers—there’s a new one nearly
every week —one half of us don’t know how
the other half live. A 17-year-old patient
admitted to a public hospital the other day
confessed that he could neither read nor
write. Inquiries unearthed the fact that a
brother, aged 16, and a sister of 14 were
also illiterates, and the more astonishing fact
that while the mother could only just about
sign her name the deceased father had not
only been a skilled technical worker but a
fairly well-educated man. It wasn’t a case
of an isolated family dwelling in the bush —
none of the youngsters had ever been out of
Melbourne. In some unaccountable way
they had been overlooked by the truant in-
spector —not one of them had been to school
for so much as a day. Heaven only knows
what strange story or perverted mistrust of
education lay behind the whole pitiful busi-
ness.
One of the passengers brought by the slow
train to Melbourne from Sydney on Christ-
mas Eve was a lad of 15 who had travelled
all the way on the nod. Half-way to Albury
he emerged from under the seat of a first-
class compartment and asked four home-
bound young fellows not to “give him away.”
Dominated by the Christmas spirit, they fed
him, supplied him with the fags for which
he panted, and, on hearing that he was just
out to “see the world,” gave him a few bob.
When he disappeared at Albury they thought
he was a romancer, but he dropped in on
them again after the conductor had collected
tickets at Essendon. He had ridden on the
roof from the border.
Adelaide passes a few remarks: —
.The inter-State bowlers had ideal weather for their
carnival, and there were some frilly trimmings. The
president (S, J. Jacobs) and his wife gave a garden-
party at Victoria Park, and on the historical 28th
the Victorians and Tasmanians were entertained at
the Glenelg bowling-green, . thus getting a glimpse
of a crowd that surpassed any previously seen at our
“Foundation” village. A tragic happening during
the carnival was the sudden death of James Robin-
son, of Gawler, one of our most .popular players,
who had been picked to go with the Australian team
to England.
The reception and luncheon to the pioneers, all
men'- and women in the eighties, always has a big
element of pathos, and at each successive anniversary
relentless old Time- makes it more marked. This year
his Ex., Lady Weigall, the new Mayoress (Mrs. L.
Cohen)and: the local mayoral pair did the receiving.
There are now left only two pioneers who came in the
Buffalo-—Miss Marianne Fisher, born in 1827, daugh-
ter of the , first Resident Commissioner; and H. W.
Breaker, born in 1830.
We are getting quite a Queen Adelaide museum.
His Ex. has just made a presentation to us of an
.original pencil drawing of the estimable lady by
a distinguished artist. It was given by Queen Vic.
to the mother of his Ex.
Lady AVeigall hds ■ accepted the position of Chief
Guide to the S.A. Association of Girl Guides, thus
creating a precedent for future Exes, to follow.
She has suggested that the Guides should give a fSte
in the Govt. House grounds in March in aid of their
funds —an idea that is sure to be adopted.
This city is boasting record holiday figures. Shops
and hotels say trade has never been so good, and
the Railway Department reports traffic exceptionally
heavy. On the whole we had perfect weather.
E. H. Martin, of the Succession Duties Department,
was the other day handed an oak clock on the eve of
his marriage. H. Boothby (Deputy-Registrar of Pro-
bates) passed on the gift from officers of the Supreme
Court . and the cricket club connected with that
sporty institution.
Charlie Downer, dead of cancer after a long ill-
ness, was one of our best-known citizens. He was
a son of Henry Downer, once Commissioner of Insol-
vency, and a nephew of John and George. Stock-
raising and sport were his two main interests in
life. As. a youth he was the best of our hurdle-
racers, and later a dashing polo-player and hunting
man. His widow was a daughter of R. Law-Smith.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Holeprol
Hostery
As far as Woman is concerned the A.J.C.’s
Christmas meeting was almost a blank. The
nist day was Christmas Eve, so that was not
much good, mother Eve’s eye being glued tight
on little Cain and Abel and their stockings
and stomachs. And Monday was steamy
and overcast, so Itandwick failed to attract
the bit of Society that still clings to town
m spite of the lure of the mountain mist
and the call of the beach. Of course, there
were a tew thousands scattered between the
stands and the tote, but what are ii few
thousands at ItandwickV Nearly all the
women wore tub dresses and shady hats, and
only here and there a parasol was unfurled
in sudden splendor. One lady carried a useful
gamp of gold tissue, while another hoisted
tier after tier of black ostrich-feather upon
white lace. This Letter met only one
woman who was really pleased with Satur-
(i".Y’R flutter. Having been assured that
.>uil On was a certainty, she had toted the
unknown to the extent of two shillings and
sixpence!
Never has a Christmas in Sydney been
more croVvded with kiddies’ parties, every-
body who owns a child or a grandchild seems
to have put out some sort of a Christmas-
tree ; and there was a conspiracy to give the
little sick ones the time of their lives. The
Coast Hospital and the Royal Alexandra for
Children were positively snowed under with
tfifts from Soutu CLmus, jukl us for the nip-
pers in the Maequarie-street pile they roy-
stered for over a week. The King and
Queen of one big Kill-pain Castle, Keith and
violet, totalling six years between them, had
a dizzy interlude when it must have seemed
to them that the heavens and the earth were
split asunder. Keith and Violet have spent
several months of their short lives in the
hospital; and the nurses are like so many
godmothers to them. During Christmas
week one of the ward sisters took the pair of
them over to the Zoo for an afternoon, and
they just loved the elephant and adored the
monkeys. It was not till the ferry began to
slip away from the Zoo wharf that any doubt
ns to their future home entered their young
minds. On a sudden the air was cleft with
prolonged wails: "I don’t want to go back
to the hospital, I want.to live in the Zoo!”
All the way back they lamented like Jere-
miah, and finally went rebellious to bed. The
next day they were missing: nurses and sis-
ters Were frantic, thinking the youngsters
had gone in search of Taronga Park; but at
length the pair were found snuggled down
asleep like a pair of younc opossums on a
pile of clean mattresses. Sister’s relief was
drowned by the call of discipline. “Really,”
she said, “this is the worst you have ever
done. Now I must put you into God’s house
by yourselves, and I hope you’ll remember
He is watching you,” and with that she
clapped the pair of them into the tiny hospi-
tal chapel. Sister was caught up in a rush
that lasted half-an-hour. Then with a swift
pang of remorse she flew to her charges, and
found them wine inside and out—the little
monkeys had found on a shelf within reach
a newly-opened bottle of wine intended for a
much more religious purpose.
The new Earl of Ducie, whom Queensland
will continue to remember as B. B. More-
ton, and his daughter Beatrice have put
their deck-chairs aboard the Ascanius. When
they get tired of the ancestral home at Tort-
worth there is a little humpy in Park-lane
to comfort them. Berkeley Capel (Lord
Moreton) follows on after he has disposed
of his Australian possessions. Later the
whole family will pass on from Queensland
to London —though some don’t feel over-
enthusiastic about the change.
Prince Obolensky, who recently went back
to London, belongs to a family which is
unique in one resnect: although of royal
descent all its surviving members are earn-
ing a crust for themselves. His mother,
whose father was Alexander 11. of Russia,
and who, when Lenin got into power, only
escaped from Petrograd by a miracip, orga-
nises concerts in London and the provinces.
His beautiful wife sings professionally and
he is employed by Vickers-Maxim. An uncle
—also descended from a Czar —returned of
his own accord from Paris to Moscow IS
months ago to take a job unuer the Bol-
sheviks. He considered that he could do
most for Russia that way.
Mrs. Willie Kelly will be back in Sydney
before her sister-in-law, Mrs. Bertie, who is
at present skiing and tobogganing in the
Swiss Engadine. Mrs. Willie and her good-
looking girl, Mary Wentworth, propose to
settle here for good, and it is likely that
the ex-M.P., his health being now restored,
will return to politics. And, moreover, by
way of the constituency after which his
daughter was christened. It is expected
that Wally Marks will stand aside and let
his leader have a clear run at Wentworth in
consideration of recent kindnesses; and it is
at that stage, if it arrives, that Willie Kelly
will step forward and announce his intention
of tackling Mr. Hughes. The venture will
be one after his own heart.
r Amongst travellers on the Naldera is
Theo Marks. The sporting architect is going
to tour India, where he will advise the
people in charge of some of the chief race-
courses on the best way to Australianise
them. Anglo-Indians who visit this coun-
try go back wild with admiration for our
grandstand appointments, and some of the
Indian clubs have the money to spend on
such luxuries. That’s where they have the
advantage of the great English courses.
Lady Carbery, who was Jos6 Metcalfe, of
Queensland, has become engaged to Major
Bebb, a London banker. She divorced her
Irish husband in Dublin in 1910, after seven
years of all-too-exciting married life. One
of her allegations against the festive peer
was that he used to entertain her with a
rhinoeoros-hide whip.
. Al< ‘ x - M.u.lt., is on' to England. He
is escorting his wife back in April. She
went away last year intending to put their
elder boy at Oxford, where one of his
uncles got a rowing blue and another—killed
in action with the R.F.A.—was a well-
known athlete. But the youngster decided
on C ambridge, because it has a famous agri-
cultural school and lie means to go on the
land.
One of Sydney’s oldest fnmilies is now
represented in the London garage and motor-
hiring trade. Nancy Parbury, sometime of
► cone, drove a car in an attractive uniform
throughout the war, and tlie two girls she
has now gone into partnership with are also
skilled mechanics—so much so that they do
most of their repairs themselves. Only’ one
member of the family is seen much in Syd-
ney nowadays—Harold Parbury, whom the
Union Club has known well for quarter of
a century.
A long-expected engagement was an-
asl week A MoiJy Little, a favorite
dancing-partner ot the Prince and one of
the few who had the good sense never to
talk about it, is to be married shortly to
Boy Chisholm. He is a brother of his
fiancee s bosom friend Sheila Loughborough,
and married, just before, the war, a well-
known Queensland girl. But incompatibility
of temper developed, and the Courts oblig-
ended an impossible situation. The
Littles were originally Melbourne people
(Mrs Little is a relation of the Maddens),
but they live in Sydney and own stations
in Queensland. Roy Chisholm’s father is
pLch'iT’ committeeman, while
his still-beautiful mother is a sister of Harry
Mackellar. J
This is the photograph of Essie Acldand
grand-daughter of that Harry Ackland who
charmed Sydney of 40 years ago with his tenor
notes, and whose
own contralto solos
were a feature of the
• Welsh S o c i e t y’s
“Messiah” on Christ-
mas Eve. A crowded
T own Hall was
stirred by Essie,
just as it was nearly
split in twain by the
triumphant instru-
ment in “The Trum-
pet Shall ' Sound.”
Anxious mothers and
fathers had one wild
first-moment when
they didn’t know
whether it was
Gabriel winding his
horn or the children
discovering their
Christmas stockings. Essie is a pupil of
Roland Foster’s, as Isolda Hill, who sang
the soprano numbers, has been since her
aiiival from Melbourne. The Society's
conductor, E. 11. .Jones, wore a big smile at
the reception given to the. chorus, and Vern
.Barnet, at the organ, and Vost Janssen, who
led the small orchestra, were other aids to
a genuine success.
Just as the South has gained one J^es —
the new Archbishop of Melbourne—the -North
is in danger of losing another. Few men
know more about that part of Austral>a
winch lies between Brisbane and Cape York
than Mackenzie Lees, for years general man-
ager of the Bank of North Queensland and
ot late g.m. of the Bank of Queensland. If
a proposed sale of his bank to the National
goes through, the chief will presently pack
Ins bachelor belongings for London. ‘ He is
young enough to take great pleasure in the
finer things of life, but too old, he thinks
to become part of the machinery of a big’
new, strange bank.
Jean Lindsay, a pretty young daughter of
etcher Lionel, has blossomed into a poet.
Her lirst chaplet of verse has been published
in the Triad. And, talking of poetesses,
some more of Dorothea Mackellar’s work is
soon to appear between covers.
Cricketer Charles George Macartney chose
the fields of Parnassus for his matrimonial
pitch, and scored Annie Bruce, classics mis-
tress of Fort-street Girls’ High School, for
his bride. Miss Bruce may not have worn
her heart on her sleeve, but something seems
to have been indicated by the name on the
gate of her home, The Wicket, where the
momentous ceremony took place. Green and
gold, the colors of the Australian Eleven,
dominated the supper table.
Ernest Wunderlich, one of the brothers
who are a hanny combination of art and
business, to the great profit no less of Syd-
ney than of themselves, had a minor shock as
he was packing for a
trip to Java, which
is merely a prelim-
inary canter for a
trip to E urop e.
After giving months
to the job of holding
both Verbrugghen
and the State Or-
chestra —he was the
promoter of the two
cos. which have put
up the Guarantee
Fund—he picked up
1 1 .day’s Telegraph
to read that tne gal-
vanic co n d u ctor
wasn’t at all likely
t<> return after his
six months’ holiday,
and that the whole
question, of the guarantee was in the air. But
a few inquiries confirmed his own informa-
turn that, whatever Verbruerirhen may do six
months hence, he certainlv left with the in-
tention not only of coming back himself, but
oi bringing his old Belgian mother and father
to enjoy the sunshine with him. So Ernest
\\ underlich goes away more or less content.
During his stav in Europe he intends to get
musical scores that Australia has not yet
had.
V ed Shaw, the little girl whose
book of verse, “The Aspen Tree.” made a
joyous ripple run through a small but dis-
criminating group of readers, had a second if
more local success the other night in her
home town, Singleton, where her father sells
iegal advice. Winifred wrote and produced
a Chinese play, “Paradise Girls,” which was
clothed m appropriate and tuneful music bv
the wife of the padre. All Singleton came—
it was something like a Melba night in Syd-
neysquattocracy even ran to its second-D'st
e\ Piling frock and its third-best diamonds,
and Dangars and such inhabited the front
pews, and the Lyster Ormsbys from Sydney
parked the family Rolls Royce. among the
other motors. The building in which the
play was staged benefited by the box-office
receipts.
ors T^/rf- e is the next artist to have
an edition de luxe. The biographical part
will no doubt tell how George was born in
1 etrograd one month after the death of his
lather, an American engineer, who had been
employed by the Russian Government. His
mother was an Englishwoman, a member of
l'Vn, Kippax, Yorkshire.
Drought to Australia when he was a boy
Humbert spent his youth in the Warren dis-
trict of N. S. Wales, and it was between
there and Isevertire that he got the subject
for his ‘Across the Black-soil Plains.” J
On his recent visit to Victoria artist Syd-
ney Ure Smith was a guest of Melba at
Coombe Cottage, and found much to admire
in the interior decorations of the songbird’s
home. Dame Nellie is tremendously inter-
ested in local art, and has promised to give
her support to the movement started bv the
Society of Artists when Lord Northcliffe was
in Sydney to hold an exhibition of Australian
Art in Dondon.
Composer May Brahe, whose song “It’s
Quiet Down Here,” has become a gentle rage
in Sydney since Clara Butt sang it, takes
up her pen to proclaim the glory of the Aus-
tralian songbirds in London :
Stella Power, who has as much work as she can
manage, is giving concerts with Kubelik in all the
chief provincial towns. Ivy Philips’s press notices
were excellent. I introduced her to my publishers,
Enoch and Sons, and they engaged her for their
ballad concerts. Her first appearance there was most
successful. Gertrude .Johnson also is singing at the
Enoch concerts, and Dorothy Helmrioh, a finished
singer and a charming girl, is rapidly and surely
coming to the front. She has sung at the Promenade
Concerts, Cramer and Enoch Ballad Concerts, and
already has a great amount of provincial work to
her credit. Oswald Rippon, a Melbourne tenor, only
here a few weeks, has already sung at a Queen’s
Hall concert and made a sure beginning. Harold
Williams, who used to be a Sydney footballer of
note, is at present doing more work than any other
baritone in England, and I think will soon be recog-
nised as the first baritone here. Horace Stevens, of
Melbourne, is already in the front rank. I am still
busy, and have been very fortunate, with my songs
since I first arrived. “I Passed by Your Window”
has been translated into Dutch and French, and I
have heard of some enterprising soul singing it a ,
Gaelic. It is doing well in America. It may interest
somebody to know that my “Good-bye and God Be
With You” was the first song transmitted by wire-
less in the Southern Hemisphere. It happened in
S’Africa on the departure of Gov.-General Buxton.
1 am hoping to visit home in a year or so, when my
little daughter will be old enough to leave at school.
The Cecil F, Kelly artist pair, of Christ-
church (M.L.), have just passed through
Sydney after 15 months ol packed-every-
rninute life in London and Paris. In be-
tween the round of art-shows and shopping
they contrived to paint some exquisite bits
of England, and Mrs. Kellv had a number
of distinguished sitters for portraits. Lord
Strathspey was one; Mrs. Tahu Rhodes a
daughter of Maoriland’s old-time Governor
1 lunkett, and Patricia Blackwood, a Munro-
Ferguson connection, were two more in the
long list. The couple found the Royal
Academy quite exhilarating, for since the
Moderns, headed by Augustus John, have
stormed the citadel, one never knows what
thrill of realism the walls may hold. At
the last Academy Lambert was accorded the
place of honor in the room in which his can
vases hung. Mrs. Kelly says that fashions
in Paris are such as to rivet the artistic
eye. The new material which the well-
dressed city is wearing for its evening frock
—when it isn’t wrapped in black velvet is
Gurante, and that resembles a brocade all
in one shade, the silken threads of the design
treated in such a way that they glisten like
metal.
On Boxing Night the Hallelujah Chorus
rolled out voluptuously for the last time
tins season, and “The Messiah” was tucked
away until the Christmas spirit of 1922
will bring it out again to hang its evergreen
bough froin the portals of the Town Hall
Ihe I hilharmonics supplied this last per-
“™ans and an audience that just a little
the <mS an cl . eai 'e d ex Pense S was a]l that
the good work of the society netted. Joe
Bradley led the singing hosts, while the
State Orchestra supplied a starry back-
ground to soloists and chorus. Pretty
blonde Marie Nilsson combined spirituality
with her light soprano notes, and that’s not
such an easy thing to do—rather like asking
a lark to lead the of adoring angels
Lilian Gibson supplied the contralto, Robert
bass ar P er tbe tenor and Oliver King the
The eleventh number of Art in Aus-
traiua, which is just out, contains a repro-
duction m color of a stunning—in everv
sense—Longstaff portrait of Mrs. Reg
Broomfield. Denis Allen has lent a pencil
chawing of his fiancee, Molly Dangar—the
Dick Dangars’ girl—by George Lambert. It
presents her as the ideal flapper—with a sug-
gestion of Monria Lisan inscrutability. The
publishers make the heartening announce-
ment that this is the last issue at 12s. Od.;
m future it is to be 6s.
i vf ke collectors of Baxter prints are gam-
bolling even as the young lambs in Spring

E.G.S.: The way you put it it’s as in-
teresting as a ton of pig-lead.... Cecil M.: Groom
your _horse a bit more and parade him again. .. .
Forlorn: Very close up; a bit fresher idea or a bit
better work would have carried it in. .. . T.H.W.:
Not badly done, but done so often... .L.L.: There’s
a good idea in “Wing.” See if you can’t do sbme-
thing better with the first and third stanzas....
Gladys P.: Nice enough verse ; but hardly enough in
it....Spr: “Horse Deal” is disappointing. That
dream business is so unsatisfactory... .A.M.H.: The
market is overstocked with horrors. ... J.M.S.V.:
Why not use your own material? A man shouldn’t
live in Nigeria and waste a pen like yours. .. .
Cental': But that man didn’t suggest that the State-
school kid wasn’t as well taught. He merely said that
the S.-s. youngster was marked with the State-
school brand for prejudiced asses and others to shy
at.... C. Fino: Thanks, but prior publication bars
it. .. .P.G.S.: We threw no brick at your foreign
mission. All the same, probably the very best
thing the white man could do forthwith for the
colored person would be to eradicate venereal dis-
I eases at home. A Natal correspondent has just
told us of a tribe in Central Africa which has
recently sterilised all the males. The awful effects of
contact with “civilisation” convinced the big chief
that his people would be better dead.... Gouger: There
are agents on the job already. Do you want some
addresses? Not that they ever do very much. . . .Abdul-
lah : You linger too long on the way. . . .F.G.M.:
Well, the Chow; was wrong. The proportion of alloy
to gold is not less in a half-sovereign than in a
sovereign. There is one-twelfth alloy in each...,
Bellerive: The New Year item has a thrill:—
To a veteran in he’s lonely den
Past memories did unweave,
While mirth and din did welcome in
The joyous New Year’s eve.
He brooded o’er he’s village home
Across the bounding tide,
Where he’s wife in the prime of life
On the eve of New Year died.
The wafting of the village chimes
Was but a mournful knell,
For sadly with the waning year
She took her last farewell.
The veteran pondered o’er the past,
While music, mirth and din
Gaily rattled out the old
And hailed the New Year in.
. ...E.A.C.: The “Tale” is no good, and the telling
Of it falls far short.. . .R.A.S.: Too slight....
Lance J.: Both of them have points, but not enough
staying power. .. .C.R.8.: No butterfly could ever
rise from the dust if it had to carry the weight of
“thou” and “forsooth” in the first stanza....
F. : “Waikawa” doesn’t move us to any enthu-
siasm. .. .J.W.G.: “Donaldson” has to go back....
G. : You’ll have to do better than that. Lines
of words which say obvious things and rhyme every
few yards don’t constitute verse.... Lucknow: Not
quite bright enough—for a shocking example....
Harry N.: Only the old commonplaces in bad verse.
. ...A.K.A.: There is no grip in the yarn. .. .Tom
M.: Thanks for the wish, which is kinder than the
verse... .W.R. (Norwood): That grave of the “Un-
known” has been worked to the last sad 50b....
R.W. (Magill) : Terrible... .A.G.H.: Not up....
Notel: Doesn’t get near the goal. .. . J.R.P.: Not
quite well enough done... .Youth J.: So little in
them that we could hear the wind whistling around
the bones.... Paul M.: “Fragment” hadn’t the
strength to kick itself in... . Habladora: The verse
doesn’t carry it K. 1.: Been often better done....
K.K. (Lindfield) : Shocking. .. .R.0.W.: One of the
impossibles. .. .E.M.R.: Very lumpy and common-
place. .. .8.D.R.: Not much chance for one who
rhymes “untold” with “50u1”... .Ally M. : Very,
p00r.... Prologue: Suppose it means something. But
there really isn’t any reason why poetry should be
a sort of riddle.... Jack Vivian: We were beginning
to miss that kangaroo-mailman joke; it’s nearly a
year since it last looked in.... Chev: Similar musi-
cal mind-reading turn toured the Rickards circuit
years ago J.T.S.: Both 01d.... Mountain Ash:
This one misses; but have another shot. . . .P.E.H.:
Anything printed is paid for C.H.R.: That sort
of two-column article is off The Bulletin’s beat....
H. : If Liza and Angelface aren’t lady-cats then
somebody should be had up for false pretences or
something Kat: Fine sample of the direct
method :
I’m Billie Muggin,
Just finished scrubbin’
For a cocky down the South,
Who gave me a cheque and a handshake.
Straightaway to city I myself did take.
I like to gaze about the city with opened mouth
And watch the townies gad about.
While coming down in the great big train.
Men asked me (I could hardly restrain)
To play at cards. They were kind, no doubt.
But the cocky told me not to flash my cheque about.
When I’ve some change I hope to meet those chaps
again.
The way they considered me. Each had a heart.
And, strike me, when I got off the train a tart
Who seemed to know me called me “Pet.”
. ...L.F.R.: If there was any mirth in the teeth
yarn you killed it in the telling L.G.F.: The
most remarkable spelling we have met for weeks....
J.L.1.: “Honest John” has merits, but it doesn’t,
appeal to us. ... W.A.L.0.: “Triangle” is transparent.
. ...E.F.W.: The old sort of brag under cover of a
supposed narrative. .. .Warradulla: Not much of a
yarn J.T.S. : Very thin and poorly told
J.M.11.: “Pete” has a hint of quality, but not enough:
to get him a job H.L.8.: Sorry; but none of
them get near .F.M.C.: Too little in it
H. 8.: Misses, but not by a mile... .8.0. Y.: Remarks;
about rabbits nearly as old as rabbits themselves....
Morpeth: You doubt The B. on Ernie Rice. Well,
read this from N.Y. Police Gazette (19/11/’2l) :
“Rice’s little bubble was burst when he made his
first important American appearance in the Madison
Square Garden ring on October 28 for a 15-round
encounter with Sailor Friedman of Chicago. Rice
showed little of anything in the way of boxing
science or punching power.”
'TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
L. 11.: Looks like a nightmare born of too much
Christmas pudding. .. .L.G.S.: A long way below
par. .. .W.A.H.: One poultry expert is enough for
the time being. .. .J.J.K.: Amateurish; but shows
some promise; might be as well to have him taught.
. ...L.R.: That cow’s beyond a joke... .H.W.T.:
Misses.

A Rugged Tribute
The Manager, 398 to 406 Pitt Street,
Wriglby’s Ltd., Svdney. Sydney.
Dear Sir,
I have been often going to write and give you a little item of some interest to you.
Recently I went on a holiday to New Zealand, and while there climbed Mount
Hutt (7,180 feet), without a guide, and along an untried spur. I did (with one com-
panion) five and a half hours climb to the snow-clad summit, and four hours for the
descent over a frightfully steep, jagged bare mountain side, where for 5,000 feet we
had not a vestige of twig or grass for a grip, nothing but bare broken rocks, and on
occasions vve would climb and cling for a few moments, and then lie flat, hang on to
a piece of jagged stone and pant to get our breath back again. lam telling you all
this, because it is to the credit of Wrigleys that we did the whole trip on Wrigley’s
Juicy Fruit Chewing Gum and a little chocolate. The chewing gum was absolutely
our only drink till we reached the snowline, and without it, under the circumstances,
we could not have continued.
I thought you might like to know this, and so I have just passed it on to you.
Mount Hutt is situated nea'r the Southern Alps, out from Ashburton in the Pro-
vince of Canterbury in the South Island of New Zealand. From it you can see the
Tasman Sea and the Pacific Ocean, also the coastline for 130 miles, the snow-topped
Alps, the Waimakariri, Ashburton, Rakaia, Rangitata and Harper Rivers, also Lakes
Ellesmere and Coleridge.
Yours faithfully,
• ALBERT LEWIS.
P-S- The track took so much out of our boots that the iron nails were worn right off,
and the heavy military heels were torn to shreds. The physical exertion was ex-
tremely severe— hence the value of 'Wrigley’s.

“Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills act on me
like a charm. I have found them so
different from all other {kills of this
nature, and so much more,efficacious,
that I feel I want to write and tell
you how much I appreciate them.
“For some considerable time I suf-
fered from Kidney Trouble, which
affected my system and caused me
much distress. I tried numerous
things with no beneficial effect until
a friend recommended me to try Dr.
Sheldon’s Gin Pills. I did so, with a
great deal of doubt on account of the
others having proved so useless, but
they seemed to benefit me right from
the first, and after taking a course of
a few bottles they entirely cured my
Kidney Trouble and removed all
symptoms of a nervous breakdown.
“I consider Dr.. Shel-
don’s Gin Pills a most
wonderful remedy, and
can, and do, heartily re-
comno end them to any
person suffering as I have.

A Battle-song of Men.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
H EAR us, oh World !
The mystic flags of Fate are now
unfurled,
And we demand the dubious truce must
cease
While you shall say if it is War or Peace!
If it is Peace, why, then, with joyous stride
We all shall walk, harmonious, side by side!
If it is War, we meet the battle shock,
Undaunted as Prometheus on his rock!
We fight through all, or leave the fatal field,
Like the dead Spartan borne upon his shield!
We know you, World—ah, yes, we know
too well;
One phase of you is Heaven and one is Hell!
Angelic parent who can love and save,
Or fierce stepmother cruel as the grave !
Through children’s hearts your savage spear
you thrust,
You trample cowards and weaklings in the
dust.
However you may threat and sneer and
frown,
By God, you never get the strong man down !
You hurl your pains and sorrows at his
head—
He throws them back at you until he’s dead!
You stab him when he has no battle chance,
And then he writhes him up along your
lance,
Strikes one Berserker sword-cut, hard and
fast,
And goes to death, defiant to the last.
So, too, the noble woman, brave of soul,
She scorns your tyrant efforts at control; .
She meets you, calm-eyed, in the battle
gloom,
And, without tears or wailing, meets her
doom.
You have no craven terrors for such men
As Sea-King Regner in the serpent’s den.
Hear Thorston Raudi to his matchless sword
Sing the wild song that Valor can afford!
See in the winds, defiant of the World,
The battle flag of Sigurd is unfurled ;
And stern Achilles, with his wondrous shield.
Unconquered ranging the Illyrian field!
Ten million souls of brave men from the
Shades!
A million souls of Amazonian maids!
From the dread silence hear their voices
borne:
“We laughed the World and Death and Hell
to scorn!”
In our grim fight the traitor has no part;
We drive the quivering javelin through his
heart.
We scorn the abasement of the shrinking
slave,
Refuse to cowards the honors of a grave.
We reck not when or where our bones may lie
But die unconquered as the valiant die !
Defy the Fates, however they may frown—
By God, they never get the strong man
down!
QUEENSLAND.
A. MESTON.
Cheated.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MOST people are afraid of something.
They have aversions which no
amount of reasoning can conquer.
For instance, one man hates spiders. He
will tell you quite sincerely that he would
rather meet a roaring lion than a so-called
tarantula. Another fears caterpillars—or
cats. Some deep-down antipathy that can
no more be explained than it can be eradi-
cated. Another goes in horror of water or
the possibility of fire. Jo Schwitter feared
moths. The mere sight of one in a room
reduced him to a state of abject terror.
There was no explaining it, but the feel of
soft, furry wings beating against his hand
would send him into a frenzy of madness.
Jo kept this absurd fear hidden because it
was at odds with the character he had chosen
to represent, that of a big, brawny fellow
who didn’t care a thing for God or man.
In this capacity he knew he was most
admired by Hettie. Hettie served in a little
fruitshop that did a big business in “soft
drinks.” Behind the pryamids of apples and
pears and bananas she leaned out dark and
alluring. The heavy aroma of onions and
cabbages and the rest could not be disso-
ciated from her. It was a distinctive part
of her. From where Schwitter worked in
the monumental mason’s yard he could watch
Hettie through up-flung showers of marble
and granite chips.
The man who worked beside him watched
too, though furtively, as though he had no busi-
ness to do it. His name was Davie Bugg. He
was some years younger than Schwitter, but
undersized, with narrow shoulders and shift-
ing, close-set eyes under a thatch of sand-
colored hair. He knew that he challenged
comparison working beside the immense
Schwitter. Hettie admired girth and the
power that is supposed to go with size. Davie
squirmed incessantly under the thought of
it. The two men were not close friends. A
little morose conversation was kept going
in between the tapping chisels. That was
all. What talk there was centred mainly
round the chances of “getting off with stuff”
without being “copped.” Schwitter was am-
bitious and inclined to let precaution go to
the Devil. He knew a way, he said, of forc-
ing an entrance into a warehouse along the
river front. But the plans never material-
ised because they always wilted under the
wavering distrust of the younger man. At
the time the thought of Hettie was more im-
portunate than the possibility of getting away
with a “clean-out.” How to get ahead of
Schwitter—it was an engrossing problem.
Then one day he came by accident upon
Schwitter’s fear. Moths! He sniggered to
himself and wondered how best he could turn
it to advantage.
One night when Hettie and Schwitter were
sitting in amorous proximity in the little
back parlor he let a moth loose under the
light. It was a big fellow with trousered,
furry legs like an eagle’s, and two sinister
eyes on its wings. Jo Schwitter sensed its
presence before he actually saw the horror.
His conversation died. He watched warily,
his mouth dropped at the corners. The moth
approached him as though drawn by some
magnet. It rested on his head.
“Gawd!” he screamed in the high voice of
a scared woman. “Take it away. Take it
away. It’ll kill me. Take”
Davie laughed from the door. Hettie
looked on in scorn.
“Him a man!” said Davie spitting skil-
fully. “’Im! Frightened of flies!” He
captured the fluttering creature in his grimy
hand.
It was a psychological moment. Hettie
wavered and went over to Davie Bugg.
Schwitter stumbled out through the little
shop and went down the street wiping his
mouth.
From that time relations were changed.
It was now Hettie and Davie Bugg.
Schwitter hacked savagely at the marble.
He guessed shrewdly at Davie’s part in the
incident. For a while their cautious friend-
ship showed a tendency to die out alto-
gether ; then it flamed up again. Schwitter
made the first overtures. Apparently he
had forgotten the trouble about Hettie. He
became loquacious on the subject of forced
windows and policemen’s beats, and painted
a glowing picture of prosperity in which
both figured. Davie fell in with his schemes,
thinking of Hettie adorning herself on the
proceeds of a robbery successfully carried
through.
They arranged & night. At least, Schwit-
ter did most of the arranging. Bugg listened
and wagged his long, sand-colored head.
Davie, being the smaller man, was to go in
through the window. Schwitter would wait
outside. He thrust a revolver into the
younger man’s hand, with the remark that
it was as well to have one. Davie felt in-
clined to demur. He was to remember later
Schwitter’s insistence on that point. When
Bugg was no longer to be seen framed in
the window Schwitter went rapidly down
the street to the first policeman.
“There’s a light in that there place,” he
said, and faded away in the dark.
In the next 10 minutes Davie’s revolver
played a part. It seemed to go off in the
excitement. It blazed away, frightening
him. That went against him. He got five
years, which was a good time for a man
just over 40. He saw Hettie once. She
was snivelly and non-committal. He did not
see Schwitter. His accomplice had van-
ished. Bugg felt a lordly contempt for him
but kept his mouth shut.
When he came out of Pentridge he was
changed physically and mentally. His body
was twisted a little with rheumatism from
contact with the damp in the prison yard;
his mind was twisted from contact with
other minds baser than his own. He had
a craftiness now that peeped out of his long,
lined face, and his pale eyes snapped mal-
evolently. Five years! A lot can happen
in five years. He found that out pretty
soon. A fishmonger displayed his sea-smell-
ing ware in the shop where Hettie had
smiled out from behind the fruit pryamids.
He could learn nothing of her. Anyhow,
she seemed little more, than a name at this
period. And Schwitter! Jo Schwitter!
His mind kept running back to Schwitter.
He went haltingly along the changed street
jingling the ten shillings some well-meaning
soul had given him the day before. The
monumental-mason’s yard was still there.
He leaned against the pickets ruminating
on the possibility of finding a job inside.
He was not really as old as he looked. There
was a man tapping at a long slab of granite
with a little hammer and sharp chisel. His
back was turned to the fence. Davie could
read the first words of the inscription :
.“Sacred to the memory of H”— —
His interest suddenly went. It was cold
in the street, and the white marble and
immense columns of grey stone had the chill
of death about them. He went away.
He came back the next day and leaned
against the pickets. There was a burst of
pale wintry sun that made the surface of
the rough granite gleam like the frosting on
an old-fashioned Christmas card. The man
was still working at his inscription, his
back turned. He had got a little further
on. Chips of stone flew out. A white dust
was over the man’s boots.
Davie read the printing curiously, craning
his head over the sharp points of the fence:
“Sacred to the memory of Hettie Schwit-
ter, who died”
Bugg’s hands with their swollen knuckles
clutched at the pickets. He said the name
in a hoarse whisper with a pause between
each word : “Hettie Schwitter !”
Then the man with the chisel looked up.
It was Schwitter himself, and as he saw
Davie his big sullen face underwent a
complete change. It was a map of stark
fear. He cringed back. The chisel fell
with a clang against a piece of stone. And all
of a sudden Bugg knew that it was Schwitter
who was responsible for the failure of the
robbery five years before. It had started
with the moth enisode at the back of the
fruit-shop. He had wanted Hettie. And
he had got her. And she was dead.
He pulled at the palings. Then Schwit-
ter’s big, frightened face widened into a
white blur and vanished. Bugg had fallen
on the pavement.
* * * *
Ten years later a wizened little man, appa-
rently well over 70 but in reality only
66, was brought into the big, blatant-
looking Benevolent Home that stood in green
country well back from the sea. It was
Davie Bugg. He sat patiently in the chilly
hall, his hands crossed over the thin points
of his knees, while the necessary formalities

Make Zam-Buk a Daily Need
SMEARING A CUT, Bruise, Burn, Scald or Scratch
over with Zam-Buk means that pain is soothed
away, that the injured skin is instantly pro-
tected against germ attack, and that natural
healing is hastened.
Even wounds that have taken “bad

cases of Eczema, Ulcers, Piles
and Ringworm are most
successfully treated
by the Zam-Buk
method, which

eyes stared vacantly. Lite he?d no obfcS

resolved itself into a hunt. A fruitless huiA

ment^HVh fan! skin the color of parch-
hands were tortured out of all
shape by the rheumatism that had first
fastened its grip on him in the prison. When
he walked he was bent over, and he took
slow shuffling steps to the tune of muttered
gioans and wheezing noises. “Ouch ! Ouch '
Me rheumatics ! Oh-ey !”
He was put into a ward where there were
many windows and two rows of beds, with
faces peeking up over the spotless quilts.
Uld-man faces; old-man eyes ! Eyes lustre-
less and red-rimmed. Eyes malevolent and
dazed arid sightless. A place of finished
things—finished actions, finished hopes
finished dreams. The old men shuffled over
the bare floors, their heads nod-nodding, their
tongues lolling in the black caverns of tooth-
less mouths, their sticks scraping. They
sat along by the windows or beds thinking
vacantly and dreaming back. Always'back.
Davie was glad to get painfully into bed.
A card was tacked over the head of it. Out-
side the opposite window an arm of brown-
stemmed roses was knocking against the glass.
It reminded him in a far-off way of the chisel
that had tap-tapned against the grave-stones.
That brought him back again to the thought
of Schwitter —if he ever was entirely away
from it.
The man on the left was muttering with
rapid persistence: “I’m done. I’m cooked,
so help me God. I’m cooked. I’m done.”
The inmate of the right-hand bed had his
face turned sideways. He lay motionless,
a huge bulk under the clothes, a regular man-
mountain.
In the morning Davie squirmed down to
the bottom of the bed to take a better look
at his neighbor; On the card above the bed
was written legibly: “Joseph Schwitter. Age
73. Paralytic,”
The face was a big one, a dolorous physi-
ognomy ; the eyes awful with a vague lassi-
tude. Morbidly horrible.
Davie crawled back under the clothes,
where he lay shaking with silent laughter.
He had found Schwitter at last. After 10
years of looking. He laughed so much that
the nurse called him a merry old soul,
which made his merriment increase.
Schwitter could not speak. And he could
only move the fingers of his right hand. But
he could hear. It pleased Davie to think that
Schwitter was paying. But even this was
not enough. It was his turn to play. He
had played first; then Schwitter; now it
was his turn to make the final move. It
troubled him so much that he would lie
awake for hours before he slipped into the
. dreamless sleep of the old. They were still,
frightening nights when Davie would groan
and wheeze, going over the past things of
his life, and wonder whether he would die
or come out of the ward into the streets
again. Always the thick rose-stem would
be tapping at the window like a dulled
chisel on stone, and winged creatures would
ny m and disport round the lights.
Then Davie had an idea. A- moth had
flown against Ins face one night. lie told
himself that lie would collect all the moths he
could, and give them to Schwitter, who in
his senseless existence did not know the
identity of the man in the next bed. It
grew to be an absorbing game, this, played
when the night-light was lit and the nurse
was not m the ward. In a little time he
grew to be quite skilful, and would go to
sleep chuckling over the result of the night’s
sport, feoon lie came to have 12, secreted in
a box in his locker. He thought that was
a good number.
One night when all was silent in the ward
except for the heavy breathing of the
patients and the occasional clank of a tin
m «g on a chair, Davie crawled painfully out
or his bed and drew the box from his locker
lie stood there, a little spindle-shanked old
nian m a flapping nightshirt with a bald
head and crooked arms, meditating the re-
venge that had had its birth 10 years before,
in his tortured hands he held the moths. lie
leaned over the huge bulk on the other bed.
“Hey !” he quavered. “Hey, Jo !”
There was no recognition in the blank
eyes. They might have been two stones in
the moonlight that slanted in on to the floor.
“Hey, Jo Swifter! It’s Bugg,” came the
croaking whisper.
Life crept into the eyes that stared up. A
terrible look seemed to be burned on to the
pallid face, llecognition was there. Davie
sniggered.
“Look,” he wheezed. “Are ve still fright-
ened of flies?”
He dropped the brown bodies on to the
huge chest of the paralytic. They seemed
to flutter a little. One live one crawled up
the motionless arm.
There was a convulsive quiver of the man-
mountain. His eyes seemed to turn inward.
His head lifted, then fell back.
Davie gathered up the moths and threw
them out of the window. He knew that
Schwitter was dead. Fear had killed him.
After ten years. “He, he!” he laughed.
In the wan early morning there was a
commotion by Schwitter’s bed.
Davie kept up his perpetual titter while
the other old men were silent.
“Stop it,” said the nurse playfully. “You
naughty old boy.” The “naughty old boy”
lay back listening, and rubbing his knuckles.
‘ It’s a good thing,” said the nurse to the
doctpr, who came in eating something.
.-“Sure enough,” said the doctor brusquely.
He started to Imm “Abe,” but pulled himself
up.
The nurse went on talking in a matter-of-
fact tone: “I gave him a slate yesterday to
see if he could write anything on it.' I
thought there might be something he would
like. I said ‘ls there anything you would
like very much, Jo?’ And he wrote, ‘Yes,
death.’ And you see he got it.”
He had got what he asked for.
In the next bed Davie stopped tittering.
He clenched his fists until the knuckles stood
out like the roots of pine-trees. Two thin
streams of saliva dropped from the corners
of his mouth. He had given Sehwitter what
the dog had asked for! He had been cheated
out or his revenge. Death had cheated him!
MYRA MORRIS.
Bringing Musilami to Heel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ACCOMPANIED by a planter friend
who knew the local language, I was
journeying about the upper reaches
of the Rewa, Fiji’s largest river, and every-
where the natives exhibited the kindness and
courtesy of their race. But at a village
called Siria, the people, responding to the
planter’s highly exaggerated account of my
importance, set out to make themselves
extra-pleasant. In the house of the biggest
chief they held a kind of reception. The
inevitable kava was made and consumed in
large quantities, decorated villagers sang
and danced, and inadequately-attired girl
shyly placed about my neck and shoulders
garlands made from the inner bark of the
hibiscus. In accordance with age-old tradi-
tion, men and women squatted before me on
the mats of the floor and made highly com-
plimentary comments on my appearance and
attire, the chief outdoing the others in
these remarks.
For a time all went well; then one man
stated that he liked my trousers. He was
enamoured of my trousers. They were the
best trousers he had ever seen, he said, and
he asked the planter if he thought the great
Turaga beside him would give the garment
away if he were asked. There was a sudden
hush at this, for it is a recognised custom
amongst these natives that when a thing is
asked for, or even extravagantly admired, it
should be handed over. Seeing that the
natives had been so kind, I would have given
the man the garment; but I was travelling
light, and my only other pants were sopping-
wet from a long day’s journey in the rain.
I had this explained to the chief, and he
undertook to relieve me of the necessity of
wearing wet clothes or being considered
mean. He was an old man who prided him-
self on his knowledge of the ways of white
men and their countries. He rose and spoke,
and the planter translated his speech for me.
“Listen, my brothers,” he said, “a great
shame has come upon Siria this day, and my
stomach aches at what people of other lands
will say and the mockery they will cast when
they hear. This Turaga is a great white
man. Oh, a very great white man! He
writes things in books. In many books.
Also in the papers with pictures in them.
Even now have your eyes seen the machine
with which he makes the pictures. He writes
things that are wise and true, and many
people read these things and rejoice. They
rejoice exceedingly Everyone speaks of
liow great a man he is. He has sailed all
the seas in the big ships, and has written
down the things he has seen. In Sydnee
the people speak his name continually, so
great a man is he ; and he sleeps in the house
of the little man who is king of Melbin.
Many presents come to him. When lie goes
in the big ship to Befetani, King George
Number Five sends to him the women of
his house laden with yams and bananas and
kava roots the thickness of a man’s leg.
The best house is made ready for him. Oh,
I tell you he is a great man !
"And now he comes to Siria. He comes
to make the people of Siria proud of h.s
presence amongst them. And what do the
people of Siria do when this great Turaga
is with them? One man—a man named
Musilami —seeks to beg his trousers!
"To beg Ms trousers!
“It is a great shame that has come to
Siria, indeed. For the Turaga will put it
down in his books, which all people read,
that a man in the village of Siria tried to
beg his trousers!
“And in the papers which .have pictures
will be the village where this thing hap-
pened. Truly has the man Musilami brought
shame to his village. For many people will
read, my brothers, and they will see the pic-
tures. And they will laugh and speak in
scorn of Siria. In Suva and Levuka will
they laugh and talk and mock. On the
beaches of Samoa will the news be passed
from mouth, to mouth. And many will ask:
‘Who is this foolish man called Musilami
who sought to beg the trousers of the great
Turaga?’ And others will ask: ‘What kind
of piace is this Siria that its people do
things like this? Truly must they bu igno-
rant people.’ And they will hear in Tahiti,
and in Lifu and in Tonga ; and the singers
will make new songs about the people of
Siria. And the king of Melb’n will carry
with him the book and the papers with the
pictures that he may look often and laugh.
And King George Number Five will ask that
the Turaga tell with his lips, the story of
Musilami that he may hear with his own
ears how'-a foolish man brought mockery on
his village. Even now, before the news Ims
gone forth, is my heart bowed and sore with
the shame”
He was interrupted by Musilami ap-
proaching on his knees and begging that the
Turaga be asked to forgive him. He had
not really meant to ask for the trousers, he
said: it was only that he had been over-
anxious to show his deep respect for the
great white man who honored the village
with his presence. He had admired the
trousers and spoken so only that the Turaga
might be pleased.' Would the chief ask that
the Turaga write not in the books of tins
foolishness of Musilami, who was so deeply
sorry that his blood was turned to water?
In keeping with my mythical importance,
I. signified regally that the man was for-
given and that the incident was closed. Then
Musilami smiled, the girls spuatted on the
mats began a hand-dance, and the kava-cup
started on its round once more.
