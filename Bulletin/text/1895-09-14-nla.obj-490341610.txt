NOTES.
William Watson is now very much over-rated,
and now equally under wited. About the just-
e«t appreciation of his talent that _ has yet
appeared is made by “ Laurie Magnus” in Black-
Iboon’s for July. The kernel of it : Mr. Watson
• ! ‘ stands outside of his picture, and is ‘ heard,’ not
Torrrheard.’ ” (In other words, he is not true
'poet, but poetical analyst,deseriber and commenta-
ilor.) “He is not, nor has he ever claimed to be, a
■ poet of the higher rank. . . . He is a graceful
'tritic, a kindly satirist, and a cultured observer; a
itdau withal of deep personal emotion matched by
% stateliness of expres ion. There is ample room
'for Ids like ... but in the valley, not on the
anights of Parnassus.”
' Now that Nordau’s “Conventional Lies” has
been before the ] ub oin a cheap American edition
for seven year*, an every democrat has assimi-
lated its message, London publisher Heinemann
issues a copyright edition at 225. posted, and
warns Australian booksellers that anyone selling
the “ pirated version ” will be prosecuted. Con-
sidering all the circumstances, considering also
that Nordau poses as prophet and denounces as
degenerate Tolstoi, who refuses to protit by his
literary works, the warning seems a philosophic
blunder, an 1 is likely to be a commercial failure.
By-the-bye, a well-fought suit between English
publisher and Australian bookseller on this [mint
of copyright should be interesting. Will anyone
be butchered by the lawyers to make a literary
holiday ?
“ Hypatia. ” one of Chas. Kingsley’s most read-
able novels, appears in a charming pocket edition

PERIODICALS.
. Cosmos (Gd. N.S.W. ; Bd. beyond) completes
its first year with the August number, which
contains portraits of Miss Juliet Flegeltaub aud
Mr. Julian Salomons, Q.C.; some good, {jopular
contributions ; and two or three of literary quality
—notably A. Nugent Robertson’s version of the
“Death’s twin-brother, Sleep” idea :
Like children in a darkened room,
Fear-filled, that speak with bated breath,
With fancied fears we fill the gloom
That shrouds the nursery of Death.
A footstep comes, a distant tread
Echoes along the corridor.
And terror, on the heels of dread,
Goes echoing in the creaking floor.
Again the fearful faces swarm,
The fearful shapes stand out and grin,
With menace of an unknown harm ;
And then —there softly enters in—
So we mistake ! —the kindly face,
The tender arms to which we creep,
The light at last! —the soft embrace—
The nurse God sends to bid us—sleep 1
The last verse might have better connection ; there
is too much “fear” and “echo;” but the meta-
phor is very pretty.
The August Review of Reviews (lid.) has a
food article on Q. Supreme Court Bench, by C. B.
'letcher, chief Courier leader-writer. The omis-
sions are particularly well-written. Other leading
articles deal with English politics, and election-
results discount a good many of the conclusions.
The remaining contents are well up to the average.

GORDON'S COLORS.
The color-sense has developed with civilisation.
Our incomplex forefathers knew not a tithe of the
K" ;e hue-distinctions familiar to us. Homer has
rdly half-a-dozen simple color-epithets, though
by dexterous combination he gains a larger
•took ; but modern poets have a whole gallery of
lints to adorn their landscapes.
Gordon drew very largely upon the vocabulary
of color. In addition to words depicting general
impressions of light or darkness —such as bright,
brilliant, dull, dim, pale, wan—he uses these-
iiiuple terms : Alabaster, azure, amber, bay, black,
blue, brindled, brown, cerise, coral, chestnut,
crimson, dappled, emerald, golden, green, grey,
ivory, lilac, orange, pink, purple, raven, red, roan,
rose, sable, scarlet, silver, snowy, sorrel, tan, tar-
tan, white, violet, yellow. Gordon also exten-
sively uses compounds like blood-red, blood-shot,
brick-colored, brown-burnt, coal-black, dapple-
grey, dark-brown, dark-plumed, emerald-green,
fire-hushed, golden-headed, goldeu-hued, golden-
tinted, golden-tufted, iron-grey, many-hued,
olive-tinted, parti-colored, pearl-tinted, purple-
re hied, rose-hued, rose-like, rose-red, rose-tinted,
sapphire-hued, silver-grey, silver-white, slate-
solored, steel-blue, violet-veined.
Such are the pigments with which the modern
poet paints Ins pictures; and such advantages has
he over his ancient predecessor, whose most
brilliant effects were produced from little more
than white, black, blue, red, green, and yellow,
Gordon’s color-sense was keen ; even he has not
fully utilised English color-resources. Burely he
would have found useful: milky and milk-wnite,
lily and lily-white, argent, ebony, drab, russet,
and chocolate, damask, cherry, and ruby (to
match his numerous lips), vermilion, lavender,
turquoise.
Drum the gloomy tone of much of Gordon’s
verse one might expect gloomy epithets to pre-
dominate ; but the reverse is the case. Kud
impressed him most strongly, and is frequently
opposed to white. Blue sky is often set against
green turf; but yellows and browns are not
favored. The poet did not love neutral colors : he
preierred violent contrasts —high lights and deep
shades. Curious admirers may like to know that
red is used 48 times in Ins poems (copyright
edi Jon), scarlet, 13, and crimson, 14 ; white, t8 ;
green, 30 ; black, 211; blue, 24 ; grey, 23 ; golden,
23, and yellow, 0; purple, 10, and violet, 4. No
ather term occurs more than four times.
Note, finally, that Gordon had a distinct pre-
dilection for blondes. It is true he is once on
excellent terms with a lady who has “a dark
aye, ” though he says nothing of her hair or com-
plexion. But “ the lady Mabel a lady mur-
deress—is dark, with raven hair; and Delilah is
mother brunette, with magnificent black tresses ;
vic e Briseis, and Guinevere, and Gwendoline —
all praised—are represented as goideu-haired
olondes.
SOME RECENT BOOKS.
' Mount Desolation,” by Carleton Dawe (3s.), is
mother “typical Australian romance,” with a
little bit of wild Australian girl, a bit of tame
melodrama, a scrap of the Kelly gang, a touch of
! ‘ Robbery Under Arms,” a fragment of “The
Last of the Mohicans,” and a few other things,
sandwiched into what should certainly be a popu-
lar story —especially in far-away Britain, where
hundreds of quiet households shudder at the dady
dangers with which bushrangers and blacks sur-
round the brave Australian pioneers.
The third edition of “ A Dili’s Hide in Iceland,”
Dy Mrs. Alec. Tweedie (Is. 4d.) is excellent value,
wid is brightened by 21 good illustrations. Sub-
ject, rather than style, makes the book interesting;
(or the author’s pen is stilf and guide-booky, and
she has no sense of humor. JPity Bara Jeannette
Duncan’s “Social Departure,” the best book of
'.ravel ever written by a woman (and, indeed, one
which few men have rivalled for interest), cannot
be obtained in similar cheap form from an
.English publisher. In America you get it for 2 6
oeuts; but the only English edition is at 8s.
po ted, and even that is now growing scarce.
“The Confessions of Amos Todd, Adventurer”
[Is. 4d.) is a rambling string of anecdotes and
experiences, very readable.
“ By Adverse Winds,” by Oliphant Smeaton
(4s. 3d.) is fluently written, and shifts the conven-
tional puppets through the conventional situations
without dropping them into any holes a machine-
god can’t pull them out of. it also airs the
author's good Scotch, and the tags from his com-
monplace-book, and the knowledge of local papers
ind politics which he gained during a short
Australian press career; and tliere is possibly a
julficient amount of interest in these things to jus-
tify their publication. Mr. Smeaton’s work, in
abort, is neither better nor worse tlian that of a
acore of novels which drop every day from the
press, predestinated some to short popularity and
some to utter oblivion. It is a pity more can’t
honestly be said in its favor; fur Mr. Smeaton
(now editing the Liberal, a small weekly Edin-
burgh newspaper not yet a year old) has tlie good
taste to make his literary hero contribute to “ the
Sydney Bulletin, an amazingly able journal,”
im<1 his back certainly deserves scratching in re-
turn.
J. N. Pentelow’s “Story of the Test Matches,
England v. Australia ” (Is. 3d.) with details,
scores, analysis, and comments from ’77 right up
to date, is invaluable to cricketers.
E. W. Cole issues a*fresh edition of “The New
Party (Is. Gd.) noticed some time ago as a colleo
•ion of highly-coromendable yearnings without
much practical value. The same publisher’s
“Government by the People” (Is. 4d.), by the
authors of “ The Story of My Dictatorship,” adds
another manufactured-Utopia to the long list. As
its constitutional speculations are not sugared with
a story, the popular supremacy of “ Looking
Backward” and “News from Nowhere” is un-
likely to be overthrown.

origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry

candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,

ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, ho.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

CHOUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
> CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. Ift
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat,and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healiner power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 69 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
-Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.-Yours faithfully. J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

to stop them for a time, but a radical CURE. Because

QURSB L V B S!
We wish Ur to he understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely ino usive variety ol the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the oonsequeut blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when wo
assert not in timorous tones, but with ttie trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves puBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life —honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little baud
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
wlio in self-abnegation and oontentediiess, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but it the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then snrelv the laborer is worthy of his lure,
and the doer of good actions entitled to sonv recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
nevercease from their toil ; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun th y work, oppress'd by the cruel frost of
snmcwhiie baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
It has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will d ' tne
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
The only really successful prevent*
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cut!-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties fiom
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

“HULLO”
W’en you see a man in woe,
Walk right up and say “Hullo!’’
Soy “ Hullo ! ” an’ “ How d’ye do 1 ’
“ How’s the world a-usin’ you ! ”
Slap the fellow on his back,
Bring yer him’ down with a whack,
Waltz right up, an’ don’t go slow,
Grin an' shake an’ say, “ Hullo ! ”
Is he clothed in rags ? O sho !
Walk right up an’ say, “ Hullo I ”
Rags is but a cotton roll,
Jest for wrappin’ up a soul,
An’ a soul is worth a true
Hale an’ hearty “ How d’ye do ! ’
Don’t wait for the crowd to go,
Walk right up an’ say, “ Hullo I ”
W’en big vessels meet, they say.
They saloot an’ sail away.
Jest the same are you an’ me,
Lonesome ships upon a sea ;
Each one sailing his own jog
For a port beyond the fog.
Let yer speakin’-trumpet blow,
Lift yer horn an’ cry, “Hullo !”
Say “ Hullo ! ” an’ “ How d’ye do ! ”
Other folks are good as you.
W’en ye leave yer house of clay,
Wanderin’ in the Far-Away,
W’en you travel through the strange
Country t’other side the range,
Then the souls you’ve cheered will know
Who you be, an’ say, “ Hullo ! ”
KEEP-A-GOIN’.
If yon strike a thorn or rose,
Keep a-goin’!
If it hails or if it snows,
Keep a-goin’!
’Tain’t no use to sit and whine
When the fish ain’t on your line ;
Bait your hook and keep on tryin’—
Keep a-goin’ 1
When the weather kills your crop,
Keep a-goin’ 1
When you tumble from up top,
Keep a-goin’ !
S’pose you're out of every dime,
Gettin’ broke ain’t any crime,
Tell the world you’re feelin’ prime—
Keep a-goin’ !
When it looks like all is up,
Keep a-goin’!
Drain the sweetness from the cup,
Keep a-goin’ !
See the wild birds on the wing,
Hear the bells that sweetly ring;
When you feel like sighin’—sing !
Keep a-goin’ !
The other day a Collingwood policeman,
afflicted with the custody of a limp female in a
deplorable condition ot rum and mud, and being
unable to procure a cab, pressed into bis service
“in the Queen’s name” a man who was passing
with a hand truck. The placid “drunk” was
loaded on to the truck, the policeman mounted
guard beside her, and the patriot in the shafts
towed both constable and prisoner to the lockup,
followed by an admiring crowd awed by the
majesty of the law perched on a “bottle-0 cart.”
Tim Law might have tugged the cart whilst the
bottle-0 sat a-top and steadied the load ; but in
that case it would have forfeited The BULLETIN S
respect for ever. Emphatically the Law is not an
ass.

Ginter’s Straight-out No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not

“Yankee Boodleblended tvith Polities .
The above is, of course, a caricature of the famous American national picture, which will be
given later on.
“YANKEE DOODLE ”is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has ever
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
beefi accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-centnry to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has been built np on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford to
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIN SON & SONS, who use more American h-af
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brands:—“CON-
QUEROR,” “ SIR ROGER,” “ CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;” but “YANKEE DOODLE”
ranks supreme.

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1895.
The Curse of Foreign Capital.
The great disaster which, a few days ago,
overtook the luckless Bank of New Zealand,
and compelled it to reconstruct for the fourth
time, and apply, for the second time, to the
State for assistance, is another of the far-
reaching results of the great “influx of
foreign capital which came upon Maoriland
in the years 1870 to 1885. In this respect it
ranks with the Australian financial collapse
of '93, which was the natural outcome of the
borrowing boom that lasted for 20 years or
so and practically ended in 1891. The cause
commonly assigned for these troubles is that
falling to pieces of things in general usually
described as “ the depression,” As a matter
of fact, however, no one really knows for
certain whether there is any depression in
these provinces, or not. A depression, in
the logical acceptation of the term, is a
decline below the normal standard, and what
the normal standard of things in Australasia
may be—assuming that there is such a thing
at all anywhere—no one can tell. The rush of
immigration in earlier years, the vast revenue
derived from the sale of public lands, the
successive gold-booms, silver-booms, borrow-
ing-booms, and land-booms, the employment
artificially created by the building in red-hot
haste of railways and other public works,
kept Australasia for 40 years in a state of
financial dazzle. And now that the bottom
has fallen out of all these booms, the country
has arrived in a state which may be its natural
condition or which may not—there are no
reliable data to go upon, and no one really
knows whether the present aspect of things
is a depression or not.
* * •
Of ail this country’s many booms, the
great “influx of foreign capital” which
started in earnest about 1870 was the most
disastrous. It is a well-ascertained fact that
any great and sudden increase in a country’s
supply of money tends to send up prices and
wages, and create, for the time being, an
artificial state of prosperity. It matters
nothing how the money is obtained. It may
be borrowed, or stolen, or acquired by
wringing an indemnity out of a conquered
enemy, or dug out of the ground, or estab-
lished by the mere force of popular delusion.
It may be gold, silver, State paper, bank
paper, the promissory notes of insolvent
speculators, or anything else which the com-
munity agrees to recognise as money. If
bi-metallism comes into vogue, and all the
civilised nations agree to regard silver as
legal tender to an unlimited extent at, say,
ss. per ounce, the sudden and vast increase in
the stock of money will send up the nominal
prices of everything, labor included, with a
rush, so that the average man will get,
perhaps, 25 per cent, more wages, and
pay 25 per cent, more for commodities,
and be really very much as he was be-
fore. What will happen thereafter no one
kirows, for no such universal and instan-
taneous change in the order of things has
ever before occurred within the knowledge of
man, but as every boom in the world’s
history, so far as we know it, has been
succeeded by a collapse, it is almost certain
that, in some way or other, the bi-metallic
boom would burst like the rest. How the
burst would arrive cannot be exactly fore-
seen, but its arrival appears tolerably cer-
tain. In the same way, a large addition to
the currency in the shape of a forced State
paper issue produces a temporary outbreak
of artificial prosperity. So does a flood of
mining or bogus-bank scrip—so long as the
public agrees to consider it as a thing of
value. Any sudden and extensive influx of
money, or alleged money, or of anything
down to glass beads and fish-hooks, that the
public can be persuaded to regard as such
for the time being, will answer the same'
purpose. Even tulips made a great and
wonderful boom in the days of the Dutch
tulip mania, and mud, under equally favor-
able conditions, would have done likewise.
* # *
In the 21 years between 1871 and 1892,
Australasia borrowed, roughly speaking,
£246,000,000, publicly and privately. Of
this amount, Maoriland alone raised
£44,000,000, most of which was borrowed
in 10 garish years, from 1875 to 1885.
While this influx continued wages, rents,
and land values went up on a scale of
dazzling magnificence. It was at this period
that the downfall of the great Bank of New
Zealand, and many other financial institu-
tions, began, and the cause of it was not so
much recklessness or mismanagement as
the policy of the Government and the
people, and the curse of foreign capital
in general. The banks at that period
had to do business on the basis of
values as they were, or else cease doing
business altogether, and close up for good.
Even if the management foresaw the col-
lapse that must come when the boom fell
through—which is wholly improbable, for no
one ever does foresee such things—and how
the bottom would fall out of the securities,
and the shareholders’ capital all slide down
into the bottomless gulf of depreciation, it
would probably have made no difference,
L'iie alternative lay between trading on
values as they were and risking the conse-
quences, or else letting practically the whole
business go, and winding up the bank in the
zenith of its prosperity. And in these days
of large profits and 15 per cent, dividends
the shareholders, who now curse the manage-
ment for its misdeeds, would have raised one
unanimous shriek of derision had such an
alternative been suggested, and the com-
munity in general would have done likewise.
Maoriland’s big financial institution, and a
good many smaller ones, came to grief because
the nation, by supporting the Vogel policy,
created certain artificial conditions ; because
the directorates apparently did not foresee,
any more than the nation in general, that
these conditions couldn’t last ; and, further,
because it would have made very little differ-
ence if they had foreseen, as no one would
have believed them. They might, no doubt,
have done something to mitigate the disaster,
but it was hardly possible to do much.
* • •
The financial troubles of Australia were
also, to a great extent, of the people’s own
making, and tiie influx of foreign capital
was the means by which they were brought
about. The political system under which
the country is misgoverned no doubt
makes it difficult for the nation to express a
definite opinion at the polls on any one
subject, yet the fact that it consistently sup-
ported, for twenty years or so, the politi-
cians who floated big loans and believed in
promoting the influx of foreign capital, places
a fair share of the responsibility on its
shoulders. The influx of foreign capital
gave a fictitious value to land, to bricks and
stone and mortar and galvanised iron, to
many useless varieties of labor, to the scrip
of all manner of companies, and to other
things without number. It even lent a
certain value to James Munro’s p.n., and to
the IO Uof Matthew Davies, and to
Fink’s bill at three months, by creating an
artificial and wholly useless industry—that
of land-boom finance—in which Muneo and
Davies and the lamented Fink had their
uses, if anybody can be said to have a use
who is employed in an occupation that is in
itself wholly useless. When the influx of
borrowed money practically ceased, all these
things became as if they had never been.
Their special variety of finance became ex-
tinct, therefore James Munro and his species
were valueless, and their “securities” were
like themselves. Bricks and stone and
mortar and galvanised iron dropped with
a sickening thud ; so did land, and scrip,
and every other commodity on which
money could be lent. There was much
lying, fraud, misrepresentation and un-
disguised robbery about the financial in-
stitutions which came to grief in that famous
collapse, yet the worst and heaviest part of
the loss was owing to the influx of foreign
capital, for even where it was not directly
responsible it made the opportunity for the
fraud and robbery, and the other sins of the
boom. Even the most honest and cautiously-
managed institutions had to trade, in a great
measure, on the basis of things as they were,
and lost enormously. Some of them, which
suspected the disaster afar off, endeavored
to secure themselves by limiting their
advances to one-half the value of the security,
but even this wide margin often failed to
cover the difference between things as they
had been in the boom-time, and things as
they are to-day. No one really knew in
those days what was the normal value of
things, for nothing had ever had a chance to
settle down to its normal value. No one
knew how much of the alleged value of
things was the fictitious result of the influx
of foreign capital, and how much was real,
and no one cared to inquire.
# * Vs
There is no need to morally whitewash
the typical financiers of the boom j'ears ;
taking them all round they were a despic-
able lot. But what the Australian nation
apparently fails to understand even now is
that the worst of its losses were owing to
its childlike faith in the advantages of—
as it is euphoniously termed—“ bringing
money into the country.” What it has
to learn is that, whether the borrowed
capital is spent wisely or unwisely, whether
it is fooled away in wars, or in building
railways to nowhere, or in fortifications, or in
repairing old bridges and dredges, or in shift-
ing sand-heaps in Sydney Centennial Park,
the result is very much the same in the end.
The influx of large sums of money means a
boom and a general inflation ; the stoppage
of the influx —and it must stop sooner or
later—means collapse, want of work, a
sudden disappearance of the public, savings
in broken banks and shattered insurance
companies and building societies, bank-
ruptcy, misery, hunger, and general desola-
tion. Few more enduring curses ever fell
on a civilised community than the Influx of
Foreign Capital.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Information Wanted.
N.S. W. Premier and Treasurer Reid’s second
batch of estimates for the year ending 30th
June, 1896, are curious reading, and further
confirm the impression that G. Reid is the
most complete financial dolt who ever ran the
N.S.W. Treasury. The Bulletin does not
profess to have gone fully through the list,
which is a vast and elaborate document, but a
study of the first two dozen pages or so gives a
good idea of the principles on which it is con-
structed. The interest on the public debt is
put down at ,£23,000 less than last year,
whereas it will probably be a trifle more, as the
conversion operations will involve paying
interest on a good part of the new loan for
several months before the old loans actually
expire. The regular annual payment of
.£70,000 towards extinguishing the 1867 rail-
way loan is cut down to ,£15,000, so that
.£55,000 is left unprovided for. Of the annual
payment for interest on Treasury bills, £28,000
is also left unprovided for ; likewise £75,000 of
the annual payment towards redemption of
these bills ; £37,500 of the yearly liability
under another railway loan ; and £13,000 of
the liability under the Naval Defence Act. As
all these payments are fixed by Act of
Parliament, and can’t be avoided except
by the province going bankrupt, they are pre-
sumably passed on to next year, on the invari-
able principle of leaving things to posterity.
Some equally remarkable devices turn up a few
pages further on. On page 14 appears an
item : “ Shorthand writers, one at £475, two at
£438, £l333,”andas thisitem figures up to £1351
the inference is that Treasurer Reid can’t do
ordinary compound addition. On page27appears
another remarkable entry : “ Rations, Medical
Comforts, &c., for 1100 inmates (of Parramatta
Asylum) at ss. per week, £13,100.” As this
liability figures up to £14,300 it would again
appear that G. H. Reid can’t do ordinary
arithmetic. On the same page, rations, &c. ,
for 375 destitute citizens at ss. per week, are
set down at £4450 instead of £4875. Again,
on the same page, rations, &c., for 675 paupers
at ss. per week are made to produce a total of
£BOOO instead of £B7lO. On page 28, rations,
&c., for 965 paupers at ss. per week are set
down as £11,500 instead of £12,545, and a
similar item for 550 paupers at the same rate is
made to yield a total of £6650 instead of
£7150. As the blunder is always in the
direction of reducing the total, all these
things must help materially to make up
Treasurer Reid’s beautiful surplus that is to be,
but at the same time they constitute a ghastly
reflection on his inability to add two and two
together and avoid making them three. Also, it
is difficult to understand how, seeing that New
South Wales is pledged to pay £5OOO a year
towards the government of New Guinea, only
£2500 is provided for. Altogether Mr. Reid’s
estimates simply bristle with items which look,
at all events, like so many stupid attempts to
show a surplus that has no real existence, and
the necessity for a Parliamentary Committee of
Accounts to investigate that gentleman’s arith-
metic sticks out conspicuously.
A Melbourne Syndicate Grab.
In a letter to Melbourne Ale, Poet Fitz Gibbon
adduces a number of excellent reasons why
Melbourne should sit hard down on the electric-
lighting job now making its dishonest way
through Parliament. iSo far, the sonpiolent
city has hardly even realised the existence of
this stupendous grab, and there seems to be
serious danger that it will be perpetrated
before the population is sufficiently awake to
kick. Then it will kick uselessly after the
event, as it did when the great gas monopoly
swindle was fixed upon its shoulders many
years ago. As Fitz Gibbon points out, it was
originally intended to make gas-lighting in
Melbourne a municipal undertaking. But the
Corporation was poor and unenterprising in
those days, and it decided to delegate its
powers to a private co. for 23 years, at the end
of which time the business was to revert to the
city, the gasworks being handed over at cost
price, or thereabouts. The co.’s works were
erected on Crown lands, the lease of which
expired on the same day as the monopoly
terminated, and the Government pledged itseff
then to hand over the land to the Corporation
as a free gift. Most people thought that these
arrangements would effectually prevent the co.
becoming a permanent monopoly. At the end
of its 28-years’ term the municipality would
exercise its right to take over the works,
and the Government would resume posses-
sion of the land on which they stood,
and being thus ejected twice over, it seemed as
if the Gas Co. could have no permanent footing
whatever. But that wily corporation climbed
over all these barriers. It persuaded a certain
Minister for Lands to break his promise of
handing over the gasworks site to the munici-
pality, and put the land up to auction. Also,
he valued the co.’s improvements—otherwise
its gasometers, &c.—at the enormous sum of
£240,000, so that any outside purchaser would
ha\ e to pay that amount to the. co. before he
could take possession. As, of course, no one
was in a position to buy on these terms, the
Gas Co. got the land at its own price. Later
on it ran a Bill through another patriotic Par-
liament practically abolishing the municipal
right of purchase altogether, and thus rendered
its position impregnable. The electric-lighting
grab is being started on practically tbe same
lines. The Corporation of Melbourne has
illuminated the streets with electricity, and js
prepared to supply the electric-light to private
consumers, but sundry speculators, who want
to seize upon this business for their own profit,
have succeeded in obtaining a legal decision
that it has no powers to supply erectricity to
private consumers. The municipal authorities,
therefore, appeal to Parliament for the neces-
sary authority, and the syndicate, which has
its own little Bill before the House,
opposes the application. And, as the
average syndicate has many dark and mys-
terious ways of “influencing” members,
it is impossible to say what the result will be
unless the people give notice to their represen-
tatives that every M.L.A., from the Premier
downwards, who doesn’t oppose the private
enterprise scheme to the utmost is a lost mem-
ber from that day forth. Meanwhile the syndi-
cate offers liberal terms, and is about the kindest
and most generous syndicate that ever fished
for a big concession in the city by the Yarra.
All it wants is to own the electric-lighting
monopoly for a term of years, and at the end
of its lease it is willing to hand over its busi-
ness to the municipality on the easiest possible
terms. And, as the story of the gas swindle is
very old now, hardly anyone remembers that
exactly the same thing was promised in it}s
case also, and that it always is promised, and
that the promise is never kept if the syndicate
can help it.
The Finances of Federation.
The other day Mr. R. J. Black read a papei
on the above subject before that learned bul
rather dreary institution, the Australian Eco-
nomic Association. Several other weighty per-
sons presented a series of criticisms in reply,
and Mr. Black replied to them in turn, and
the other people will probably respond at a later
date. The burden of the lament on both sides
is that it is necessary to construct some elabor-
ate scheme by which these provinces can feder-
ate on an equal cash basis. Some of'the pro-
vinces are richer than others, or have a more
profitable railway system, or pay less interest
on their debt, and Mr. Black and his critics
propose various methods to prevent them losing
an odd halfpenny somewhere or other bv a
union with their poorer neighbors. South
Australia, it is pointed out, realises per cent,
interest on its railway expenditure, while
the other states of Australasia follow in a
steadily - descending scale, until at the
extreme end appears wretched little Tas-
mania, which earns hardly more than
enough to pay working expenses. Queensland
realises £2 10s. 3d. per head of Customs
revenue, while Victoria collects only £1 9 S . 3d.,
and, if the Federal Government takes over
the Customs, the contributions under this
heading, it is feared, will be very unequal.
Victoria built part of her railway out of re-
venue, therefore she has more assets and less
debt to hand over to the Commonwealth than
her next neighbour, New South Wales, Maori-
land has a war-debt of several millions, which is'
represented by no tangible assets, unless the
seedy laurels of the old fighting days can be
called an asset, and it is explained that it would
be manifestly unfair for the other provinces to
federate with her on equal terms, and take over
a share of this burden. The Economic Asso-
ciation people wrestled manfully with these and
many other like discrepancies, and constructed
various plans by which, when Federation
comes, the richer states of Australasia are to
take the poorer ones by the hair, and make
them pay up the last copper of their deficit
before they are admitted to the sacred bonds of
bi other hood. And, strangely enough, no one
seems to have got up to make the suggestion
that the seven provinces, or as many of them as
feel inclined, should federate on the simple
basis of taking things as they are, and
shouldn t worry about small discrepancies
in the assets. When Australia gets a uniform
tariff, the differences in the Customs revenue
will mostly vanish. The railway returns will
probably equalise themselves by-and-bye when
the lines are all under one Federal manage-
ment; or, il they don’t, the province which
shows a bad return to-day may possibly show
the best one later on when its boom time
arrives. Even if it doesn’t, however, it matters
very little. The fact that one province has got


its debt at a lower rate than another is of no
importance, for the Federal Government will be
able to convert all the debts into a uniform
liability at a uniform rate of interest.
And even Maoriland’s war-debt should be
accepted in a generous spirit for the sake of
unity, and on the fraternal, if somewhat illogi-
cal, ground that the other provinces should be
very glad that they were spared the same ill-
fortune in their earlier days. In short, The
Bulletin respectfully submits that Federation
will never be arrived at by the policy of going
down on all-fours and grovelling after odd cop-
pers, and that the one short and effective way is
to take things as they are. If| it is possible to
make an Australian nation, it is worth while to
sacrifice the half-penny at the end of the
balance-sheet in doing it.
Tire Melancholy Maori.
On Sept. 27, 1839, sixteen Maori chiefs of
Wanga Nui Ateva (Port Nicholson, M.L.) sold
all their right, title and interest in some 45,000
acres of land surrounding Wellington Harbor,
and' including the two islands therein. The
purchaser was one William Wakefield, agent
for the New Zealand Land Co., of London ; and
this was the consideration :
100 red blankets, 120 muskets, 48 iron pols, 2 tierces
tobacco, 2 cases soap, 15 fowlin'-- pieces, 21 ketra gun-
powder, 1 cask ball cartridge, 1 keg lead slabs, 100 car-
touche boxes, 100 tomahawks, 40 wipe tomahawks, 1 case
pipes, 2 dozen spades, 50 steel axes, 1200 fish-hooks, 12
bullet moulds, 12 dozen shirts, 20 jackets, 20 pairs
trousers, 60 red night-caps, 300 yards col ton duck, 200
y irds calico, 100 yards check, 20 dozen pocket-handker-
chiefs, 2 dozen slates, 200 pencils, 10 dozen looKinir-iflasses,
10 dozen pocket-knives, 10 dozen scissors, 1 dozen pair
shoes, 1 dozen umbrellas, 1 dozen bats, 21b. beads, 100
yards’ ribbon, 1 gross Jews-harps, 1 dozen razors, 10 d; zen
dressing combs, 6 dozen hoes, 2 suits superfine clothes, 1
dozen shaving boxes and brushes, 20 muskets, 2 dozen
adzes, 1 dozen sticks sealing-wax; which we, the aforesaid
chiefs, do hereby acknowledge to have been receivid by
us from the aforesaid William Wakefield.
The N.Z. Land Co., in addition to handing over
the red night-caps, the shaving brushes, the
Jews-harps and things, as purchase-money for
the 45,000 acres of land upon which Wellington
city now stands, agreed to set apart and hold
in trust for the descendants of the Port
Nicholson tribe of Maoris, a portion of land
equal to one-tenth of the whole block. One
hundred and ten town lots and 3500 acres of
rural lands were thus reserved. The living
descendants of the tribe—many of them edu-
cated half-castes —have for years been trying to
lay hands on the interest of these “tenths;”
but, so far, Government, which years ago
bought out the eo. at a big advance
ou red-blanket and tomahawk prices, does
not respond. Returns petitioned for show
that many of the “ tenths ” in the
town have been jumped “ for municipal
and other purposes,” and the rural lauds have
somehow shrunk from 3500 acres to some 900
acres, in a manner that nothing short of day-
light robbery or an earthquake could account
for. The less valuable remainder is held by
the Public Trustee, and, presumably, the accu-
mulated interest would barely suffice to pur- ,
chase another gross of Jews-harps to replace -
those the musicians of the tribe pinched their
tongues on 56 years ago. The perennial petition
is again referred to the Native Affairs' Com-
mittee of the House of Representatives, and by
the time a definite award is made the oldest
inhabitant will probably not remember any-
thing about the original transaction, and the
claimants will have established their right in
the local cemetery to at least a portion of
their “ tenths.” And this is the story of one
step in “ the inarch of civilisation.”
The March of Protection.
On Ist August the Cape of Good Hope put a
protective duty of 2d. per lb. on frozen meat.
This is, of course, an argument against Protec-
tion which brings joy to every right-thinking
person. “ What will Protectionists say?” cries
that powerful logician, the Argus :
It may possibly cause Protectionists here to ponder as
to what would be the condition of Victoria if all other
countries did unto us as they are done by.
The wooden-headed implication whereof is that
the Cape taxes frozen meat because Victoria is
Protectionist; also that it is the essential aim
of Protection to encourage imports ; also that a
country turns Freetrade out of its love for other
countries. Cobden’s fatuous prophecy that all
the world would follow England’s lead to open
ports finds constant echo to-day in the throats
of his short-winded apostles, but they must
needs bolster up his vain aspirations with large
lies. If the U.S.A. declare for Freetrade,
uo matter how temporarily, that is an argu-
ment for Freetrade in Australia. If the
Cape of Good Hope turns Protectionist, that
also is an argument for Freetrade in Australia.
The fact that one market has been closed
against a staple Australian export seems not to
be an argument for suspecting foreign cus-
tomers. No, we are to gamble on the supposi-
tion that all other markets will be kept open to
us for ever. The Freetrader depends on a
foreign market which may be closed to him at
any time. The Protectionist aims at an in-
dustrial autonomy that will be independent of
foreign favors. Great Britain is now Aus-
tralia’s prize customer, and the Argus, on
another occasion when off its guard, indicates,
with singular candor, the position of one
staple :
The English people are not so foolish as to go on grow-
ing an article which new countries can produce much
more cheaply, and they are turning their attention to
things which pay better. The Russian moujik, the
Indian ryot, the American prairie farmer, the Argentine,
and the Australian settler all compete for the honor of
producing, at abjectly low prices, the breadstuffs con-
sumed in the United Kingdom.
“Abjectly low prices” reward the Australian
farmer who demeans himself by competing
against yellow men and halfbreeds. For even
this abject reward a price may presently be
asked which Australia will be indisposed
to accept Salisbury, Great Britain’s
Premier, is a Protectionist. Salisbury’s
colleague, Chamberlain, is in favor of an
Imperial Zollvereiu. I, is even whispered that
he has cast off altogether the fiscal faith of his
youth. The England which Gladstone mourn-
fully describes as standing lonely in her adher-
ence to Freetrade, is being daily hounded by
the landed and agricultural interest back to the
chiefest of heresi orthodox economics—the
very Corn Laws themselves. The British agri-
culturist thinks he has too long played the
part of willing victim on the sacrificial altars
of Freetrade —he is already done on one side,
and will do violence to the god before he is
cooked altogether. Year by year the manu-
facturing interests watch the increasing flow
into England of protected manufactures. Man-
chester, which first had the dream of a bag-
man’s millennium, is now a hotbed of Protec-
tion. When the hour of England’s reversion
to her old faith strikes, what wall be the offer
made to Australian agriculturists and manu-
facturers? Is Australia prepared to enter into
a Customs union dictated by the predominant
partner—to hand over her established in-
dustries as a sacrifice to God Save the Queen
and Rule Britannia ?
Twelve Months’ Hard.
Ed. Bulletin,—The other day, in Victorian
Assembly, Murray, M.L.A., elicited cries of
“ Shame !” from the “ Respectable ” members
by stating that after attending Melb. City
Police Court for some days he had come to the
conclusion that “ the police would stick at
nothing, and that magistrates were in col-
lusion with the police,” also that the P.M. had
declined to hear any defence from a specific
prisoner and had sent him to gaol for a year.
Nothing was done—nothing ever is done in
such cases—beyond an “explanation” from
the police in the Herald, followed by an
editorial note to the effect that it was Murray’s
inexperience which caused his gullibility.
Now, the present writer has been in Melb.
police-courts nearly every day for the past
year ; he has heard police lie, witnesses lie, and
magistrates lie; and, with the Herald, he
ascribes any incorrectness or meagreness of fact
on Murray’s part to his inexperience. Had
the M.L.A. in question attended the courts
oftener, his remarks would probably not have
been worded so courteously, nor would his
specific charge of unfairness have been backed up
by one debateable case. It is in the lower courts,
to a far greater degree than the upper, that a
State Defender is urgently required. Certainly,
a man cannot be tried for any serious offence
before a J.P. or a P.M., of whom the latter
sometimes are the more unfair; but his
whole life can be mortgaged by a succession
of sentences of “one year’s imprisonment” for
vagrancy. The Judges of the general or
criminal sessions invariably see that the prisoner
obtains fair play as regards evidence. They
may, as in N.S. W., compel sittings to remain
over such protracted periods as to jeopardise
the proper administration of justice ; they may
pronounce sentences wholly inadequate to the
crime ; they may browbeat and threaten juries
into finding verdicts furthest from their inten-
tions. But, withal, any deliberate attempt on
the part of the prosecution to adduce evidence
which is not evidence, to introduce inadmissible
matter, or to prompt witnesses, would meet
with instant reproof. In the police-courts it is
different. The prosecuting sub-inspectors are
not only not checked, but positively encouraged
by the Bench ; and the luckless wretch w ho
finds himself charged with vagrancy at some
Courts for the second, time may as well make
up his mind at once for a stretch of a year.
When any big case, such as the Abrahams,
brings the barristers down from the Supreme
Court, they, while waiting in court for
their own case to come on, stand aghast at
the procedure by wddch a man’s liberty is taken
away for six months or a year. “ John Jones,
yer charged with vagrancy; ’ow d’yer plead ?”
askes the orderly. “ Not guilty.” Then
policeman No. 1 enters the box. “I’rested the
pris’ner last night, y’r VVush’p. ’E was standin’
’n Bourke-street. ’E’s always knocking about
with the lowest thieves and prostitutes in the
city, and never does any work.” “ How' long
have yer known me ? ” asks the prisoner.
“ Well, I’ve seen yer off and on for the last six
months; yer always loafing about Bourke-
street.” “ But I’ve been away in Gippsland
since Christmas until a week ago.” Six or
seven more police, perhaps a detective, follow-
all speaking in the same strain, and when they
are done the accused says, “If you’ll give me a
day, y’r Worships, I’ll prove I’m workin’ at
Collin’wood since I came back.” “ Previous
convictions,” calls the orderly; “once assault,
once vagrancy,” “Twelvemonths,” says the
Bench ; and John Jones is hurried off to the
cells. If he is unknown, he may be granted a
day’s remand on his own application, but if a
conviction is recorded against him—well,
that seems to “settle” him. Again, if
the police want a remand they can get
it. Only a couple of weeks ago a man
and two women charged with larceny w'ere
discharged after being remanded over five
weeks while the police were making ineffectual
search for the prosecutor. And the main point
of all these vagrancy prosecutions is that
many convictions are obtained on evidence
wholly inadmissible, and which any Judge
would rule out in a minute. Whenever a vag.
has money enough to fee a lawyer, which only
happens in the case of a prominent criminal, he
is usually discharged—for the simple reason
that the evidence must be limited to the day
set forth on the information laid. P.C. O’Hoo-
ligan’s, Dunbhy’s, and M'Ginty’s allegations
that “ they ahlways seen him loafin’ about,”
are met by the question, “Did you see him
loafing about on 16th June?” And as the
arresting constable is seldom able to swear that
the prisoner was not working half-an-hour
before the arrest was effected, the case falls to
the ground. A public defender would restrict
such evidence, and have an eye to the fact that
constables ordered out of court by the prisoner
remain out and keep a cool, clear iiead for
cross-examination purposes, which a man with
his liberty at stake is absolutely unable to do.
Nobody but a regular attendant at the Mel-
bourne courts can realise how lucky he is to be
out of gaol,—M‘G.

The Bitter Cry of Coolgardie.
Dear Bulletin, —Give us a lift towards
separation from the W.A vampires. We are
making a gallant fight against enormous diffi-
culties natural to this desert, and now we are
compelled to resist the artificial taxation thrust
on us in so doing by our oppressors in Perth.
They can’t supply us with food or clothing or
machinery, nor with anything we want to aid
us in our labors or to enable us to live decently.
And I believe they begrudge us food and
water. They want to monopolise everything.
They are grinding out of us a surplus revenue,
and still turn on the screw until we are
desperate and determined to separate our-
selves and land from their clutches. VV e
are unanimous, and demand separation,
and nothing less will now satisfy the
“ other aiders,” as they contemptuously
call us. We have submitted to be robbed
of our hardly-won money and are an orderly
community. But we have some spirit left. In
the main we are men from the East, all of
whom have brought money with us—more or
less. Eastern men and money originally opened
up this new territory, and now we are helped
by European money—English, French, Belgian,
and German. There are more Englishmen here
than W.A.’s, and we have unanimously com-
bined to establish a province of our own, in
the Government of which we shall have
every man of us a vote. We are daily
growing in numbers, and, as you recently
showed, outnumber our oppressors. We
ask for voting power and more representa-
tion in Parliament, and are refused. What
else can we do, then, but appeal to the Imperial
Government for separation ? Esperance Bay is
our nearest and best port. But we shall never
get a railway to it out of the W.A. Govern-
ment as it is constituted. Coolgardie is, as the
crow flies, 325 miles from Fremantle, and by
rail nearly 600 miles from Albany ; yet, per-
force, we must travel to the one or the other to
reach steamers trading with the East, whilst
the distance to Esperance Bay is only 200
miles ! We must go to the East for our sup-
plies of machinery and food, &c., and all of it
must go an extra 400 miles over W.A. railways
at high rates because, as a people, we are
“t’other siclers.” And next year we must, I
suppose, go through Perth to join a P. & O. or
Orient boat. Not a miner can get work with-
out paying £1 to the Government. We can’t
get our leases consolidated because of some
antediluvianlawthatthelength mustnotbe more
than double the width. No provision is made
for the amalgamation of leases purchased from
the original holders by large English or
European co.’s, and we must pay £1 per acre
per annum to this rotten Government, com-
posed of sandal - wooden - headed W.A’s.— ;

The Insensible Defendants.
The malingering of the Abrahams brethren
has become somewhat of another Melbourne
scandal. It is pretty well believed that certain
family-bankruptcy considerations, as well as
nervous dread of a dungeon cell, suggested the
starvation policy which these four miserable
specimens of manhood adopted when their gun-
swindle game was up. Yet they have an even-
ing paper slobbering over their “ misfortunes,”
and speaking of the scene in Melb. Banco Court
last week as “deeply impressive.” It was
merely the spectacle of two particularly craven
humbugs being treated as such by an unsympa-
thetic court. Louis and Emanuel Abrahams,
the two most persistent starvers of the quar-
tette, had so far recovered their health and
intelligence, in spite of themselves, that the
gaol-hospital doctor (a very “hard nail,” it
must be admitted) passed them as fit subjects
to receive sentence. Therefore, Louis was car-
ried into court on a stretcher, “ apparently un-
conscious,” whilst Emanuel was conducted there
by a couple of warders. Nobody expecfed him to
see the matter through like any ordinary
prisoner who doesn’t feel well. Emanuel also
became “apparently unconscious.” Then the
Judge took his seat, and with apparent uncon-
sciousness of the hideous farce that was being
performed for his benefit, passed sentence of 20
months’ hard labor and a tine of £250 upon
each of the prisoners. After which the Court
rose in a matter-of-fact way, and the two
Abrahamses, who obviously grew deader than
ever at the mention of hard labor, were carried
back to the hospital to have some more food
injected into them. Unreflecting people
seem to think that the brothers Abra-
hams deserve to be sent back to their
homes with their tongues in their cheeks,
whereas the system of imprisonment for
respectable criminals might as well be abolished
if these young men were allowed to dodge it
by an artifice available to every defendant of
wormlike character who can afford, or thinks
he can afford, to play larks with his inner
mechanism. Collapse before the jury brought
in a verdict would be the rule with prisoners,
and any who didn’t collapse would have to be
released on the ground that their delicate state
of health prevented them from following the
usual practice of younger and stronger rogues.
The “Unemployed.”
A few days ago a deputation of members of
N.S.W. Parliament waited on Premier Reid
to ask assistance for the unemployed of Sydney,
whose meetings at the Statue keep them con-
stantly in evidence. There were many different
ideas among the deputationists about the nature
of the employment to be supplied, but they
were all solid on one point, which was that
Government should “ float a loan ” and proceed
with public works of some kind. And Premier
Reid promised that, unless a brutal and
degraded Council blocked the way, the loan
should be floated and the works pro-
ceeded with. N.S. Wales has floated a loan
incessantly for 25 years, and proceeded with
public works, and thus found occupation for the
unemployed; and every time the building of
public works flagged for a few months the un-
employed difficulty grew r loud and clamorous,
and it was necessary to float another loan and
start afresh. The old trouble is now as bad as
ever, and the loan-and-public- works remedy is
again on deck. When the loan is exhausted,
the difficulty will turn up again, and another
loan and more public works will be wanted,
and still another loan after that, and so on till
after the 700th loan has been exhausted the
trouble remains just as before. The loan-
and-public-works device doesn’t help the solu-
tion one iota, and the situation may be
summed up very briefly. There either is or is
not an effectual and permanent remedy for the
unemployed curse. If there is a remedy then
it can be found if it is only sought for with
sufficient persistence and intelligence. If there
is no remedy then the Legislature has to decide
whether it will take the brutally logical course
of permanently turning a deaf ear to the un-
employed agitation, or the equally logical
course of borrowing all it can get to stave off
the trouble as long as possible, and then
repudiating the liability when it can’t
borrow any more and can’t pay interest.
In either case the State would be
travelling in some definite direction, and would
know where it was going to, which it certainly
doesn’t Just now. The Bulletin would, there-
fore, suggest that Lyne, or Crick, or some-
body, should, in a friendly and perfectly non-
partisan spirit, ask Premier Reid if he, or the
House in general, knows where he is going, or
if he is even aware that he is going anywhere
in particular. The question should be asked in
a considerate tone, as Lyne, Crick, and co.,
under like conditions, would probably not know
W’here they were going to either. There is no
capital to be made out of the matter by any
political party ; the question to be considered
is simply that the Legislature “duuno where it
are ” in this matter, and has been in that con-
dition for many years, and, therefore, it is
expedient that it should send out an expedition
in search of itself with the least possible delay.
Premier Reid seems, at time of writing,
to have a new difficulty on hand in the
shape of Railway Commissioner Eddy. Mr.
Eddy was originally engaged at .£3OOO a
year, and, when his time expired, Mr. Reid,
according to the published correspondence,
invited him to accept a re-engagement at .£4OOO.
The offer was accepted, and, at this stage of
the proceedings, Mr. Eddy went to England—
partly on business and partly on a holiday.
During his absence the Premier gave notice
that he would invite Parliament to vote the
increased salary. Then, finding there was
serious opposition in view from the Labor-
party, the flabby politician withdrew the notice
and announced that the matter would be re-
submitted at some future unstated date. The
Labor-party still opposed the proposal, and the
affair was quietly dropped, and everything
was left undecided. Now Commissioner Eddy
has returned, and avers that he has in his pos-
session a document by which Mr. Reid pur-
ports to definitely re-engage hint at ,£4OOO per
annum, apparently irrespective of Parliamentary
sanction. Mr. Reid denies this, but, at the
same time, the extra £lOOO was included in his
Estimates. Being interrogated on the subject
in Parliament, however, he shuffled off' the
responsibility by declaring that he didn’t
know the item was there, that he hadn’t
put it there, and that, in short, it had
got there in some unaccountable fashion for
which he wasn’t responsible. As the same item
appeared in the Estimates published last May,
and it has thus been before him for four months,
it would, therefore, seem that the N.S.W.
Treasurer is in an extraordinary state of ignor-
ance about his own estimates, and that he has
remained in that state for a very long time ;
also it would seem that someone else makes up
his budget for him, and that the person in
question takes remarkable liberties with matters
that don’t concern him. Either that, or it
would appear that G. 11. Reid has weakly
drifted into a very tight place through promis-
ing everything to everybody, and is now trying
to weakly crawl out of it. At all events, some
interesting developments may be looked for.
More than two years ago, Bulletin para-
graphs ?'e “ squaring”-of Melbourne magistrates
and juries were discussed in English journals.
The Age and Argus are now treating the
pertinent remarks of Marshall Lyle and
Lormer, J.P., as revelations of a quite unsus-
pected state of rottenness, “If justice can be
bought and sold with impunity there will be
one law' for the rich and another for the poor,”
screams David Syme’s organ, as though Smell-
bourne justice hadn’t been notoriously amenable
to outside influence, or hard cash, ever since
the boom scandals began to come under con-
sideration. The character of the short-sighted
city is practically gone, as a result of the abortive
sup-press policy pursued by bad Governments
under “ respectable ” editorial patronage.
Whilst local asses and deeply-interested hum
bugs are commending the public for their
“ heroic” battle with financial adversity, globe-
trotters and resident critics are representing
Smellbourne morality as it is to their friends
or employers abroad.
Maoriland Local Government Bill contains
no less than 582 clauses, repeals 81 statutes,
and abolishes upwards of 400 existing local
bodies. The number of local bodies is to be
reduced to one-fourth, and the cost of running
the whole system is to be reduced one-half.
Also, the Bill will not become law this year.
Under the new order of things Maoriland prac-
tically reverts to the old Provincial Councils,
with, of course, the elimination of many of the
legislative functions possessed by those bodies,
including the control of the police. Each island
is to be divided into from 15 to 20 counties.
All boroughs with less than 4000 population
are to be made subject to the Council of the
county in which they are situate ; boroughs
with more than that number are to be inde-
pendent as at present. All elections to be on
the “single vote” system, and the quali-
fication is a three months’ residence. All coun-
cillors to go out of office every two years.
Government subsidies to local rates are to be
discontinued, but a per capita contribution of
4s. on borough population and 4s. 6d. in
counties is to be made from the Consolidated
Fund, the balance of necessary county revenue
to be derived from lands and gold-fields. The
Central Govt, is to maintain certain arterial
roads throughout the country. To evolve some-
thing like a workable scheme from the existing
hotch-potch of town councils, road boards,
town boards, borough councils, county councils,
etc., etc., etc., has taken over 12 months, ami
when (in about three years) the Commissioners
have fixed boundaries and satisfactorily settled
all disputed interests, M.L. will have about the
most effective system of Government in the
world.

“By arrangement with ” Plain Bill Hol-
loway, “The Judge’’-was produced at Sydney
Criterion on Saturday, which should help to keep
the memory of the massive Holloway green in the
Australian mind. Still, there is something
anomalous in so light a thing being produced by
arrangement with so heavy a person as Plain Bill;
it is suggestive of a butterfly being produced by
arrangement with a ship’s anchor. “ The Judge ”
1S r a I CO « edy whioh sheds a great light on the state
of the Bench’s liver in private life. It shows a
high legal authority taking pills in the seclusion
of his own home, and hunting for his cough-
lozenge, and inspecting his eye for signs of bile,
and later on he is found with a violent
cold in his head and his feet in hot
water, and a bowl of gruel in his hand,
iben when a lady, who is pursued by the police,
takes refuge on the premises, and the Judge, with
a blanket round him, gets out of his tub to listen
to her tale of woe, and she gives him an obviously
wooden baby and a feeding-bottle to hold, there
is very little judicial dignity left. The moral is
that a Judge should only be seen in the gorgeous
petticoat of office, and his legs should never be
visible to the public. Nobody whose legs are once
seen by the public is much respected afterwards
• # «
So far, Arthur Law’s production hasn’t
received anything like the support it should do.
It is in every respect a highly-deserving comedy,
and worthy of the Criterion in its best days.
LI ton as a Judge in various stages of undress,
with n. wooden infant on hand, and a bigamous
female concealed on the premises, and his feet in
hot water, is a cheerful, riotous affair, and full of
instruction. He shows, among other things, the
evils of giving way to sentiment with a good-look-
mg female, who has got in mysteriously by the
window. He also demonstrates eloquently the
cussedness of early-rising ; the Judge, after trying
vainly to sleep along with the wooden infant, gets
up at 4’30 a.m., and, being cold and offiy half-
dressed, ho there and then consents to his
daughters marriage with two briefless barristers.
Likewise, the play is a whole essay on the
wickedness of drink, for it is the drawing of
a cork by one of the briefless sharks which
wakes up the lady on the sofa, and leads
her to explain that she has been married
to the Judge for a fortnight, and that their
infant is four months old. Misses Ireland and
Madge Corcoran, as the Judge’s two charming
daughters, fortunately fail to notice the dis-
crepancy. The rest of the co. wisely say nothing
about it. Miss Kate Bishop gives a very fine ren-
dering of the bigamous lady, and George Ireland
is somewhat more convincing than usual. Like-
wise there are many good points about Tolano’s
policeman, and Mrs. Walter Hill, as the wife of a
constable with the mumps, is a dreadful warning
to the young man about to marry. Any young
man’s best girl may grow up to look like that for
all he knows to the contrary, therefore let him
gather up his carpet-bag and flee from her in good
time.

Prof. Kennedy has added some new
features to his mesmeric show by putting his
patients into fresh monkey atcitudes, and causing
them unheard-of contortions which
weren’t ‘previously in the bill, and generally
making them rush in where a self-respecting
chimpanzee would feel ashamed to go. The Bul-
letin’s opinion of the exhibition remains the
same as it was last week, only a little more so.
Meanwhile, the fact that the hall of Sydney
School of Arts is crowded to the roof every night
convinces this paper that it is in a minority of one
or thereabouts on this subject, which fact serves
to considerably lower its previous low opinion of
people in general.
** * *
The Gaiety Co. is to make its final appear-
ance at Sydney Lyceum next Thursday (Sept. 9)
—another evidence of the fleeting character of all
earthly pleasures. Its departure will leave a
great blank in the chappiedom and johnnydom of
Sydney, which has spent most of its badly-
retrenched salary at the shrine of Grace Palotta
and Deoima Moore, and has got good value for
its money; taking things all round. The co. is
now doing a hurried round of revivals, and, after
filling in four nights with “In Town,” wherein
the marvellous back-view of Fred Kaye has been
more remarkable than usual, it does “ Gentleman
Joe” tonight (Thursday) and Friday. This
leaves four nights for the “Gaiety Girl,” in the
course of which Fritz Rimma will probably find
the job of carrying a pretty largo charmer to the
bathing-machine a good deal heavier than it was
before the summer weather set in. A hot-wind
night in this country makes the charmer feel
sultry and limp and altogether oppressive, to say
nothing of/the fact that she is sometimes abso-
lutely damp.
** * *
Sydney Royal re-opens on Saturday with
“My Sweetheart,’’ a pretty little comedy which
is associated with the early days of ' Minnie
Palmer, before husband Rogers had begun to
pursue that dainty vision round the back premises
with a coarse, material axe on the ground that he
couldn’t stand her mother. The company includes
Miss Amy Gourlay and William of that ilk,
sister and brother of comedian John Gourlay,
Misses Nelly Mortyne and Maggie Ford, Lachlan
M Gowan, Ralph Roberts (formerly of the “New
Boy ”), and others.
** * *
By the kind consent of Messrs. William-
son and Musgrove, the amateurs of Ashfield and
Summer Hill will, on 17th hist., at Ashfield Hall,
perform “ H.M.S. Pinafore ’’ in aid of the funds
of the Sydney Western Suburbs Cottage Hos-
pital. The performance is promoted by Miss
Josephine Deakin, who will play Josephine ; Mr.
Tom Rainford will bo Hick Deadeye. There will
be a chorus of 40 voices, and a picked orchestra
conducted by Mr. Fisher.
** * *
Miss Ada Colley’s sweet soprano voice is
now uplifted nightly at Sydney Tivoli, where that
other reliable favorite, Harry Shine, also hangs
out for the present. The Tivoli has a valu-
able tenor in Wallace King, and J. M. Winton
has fixed up a “disappearing clown” whose
vanishment is as wholly unaccountable as that of
Dibbs’ majority at Tamworth. This last item
has much to recommend it; the supreme aggrava-
tion of the average clown is that he won't vanish
under any circumstances.
** * *
Miss Ivy Scott, a child actress of consider-
able ability, has a benefit at Sydney Empire to-
morrow (Friday). It is also notified that the
Boneless Serpent has recovered from his recent
accident, and appears in all his unparalleled bone-
lessness every night; and three allegedly French
acrobats present a little thing of their own called
the Devil s Bridge which looks as if it might break
somebody's neck at an early date. At all events
the Boneless Serpent would do well not to stand
underneath while it is going on.
** * *
Mr. Rignold got a memorable send-off on
Tuesday, in honour of the eighth and last anni-
versary for the present—of his management at
Her Majesty s. Acting-Governor Darley, the
Ministry, both Houses of Parliament, the City
Council of Sydney, the Speaker, the president of
the Fossilised Chamber, Major-General Hutton,
Parkes, and many other notabilities assisted either
personally or in the spirit, and a fashionable
audience backed them up. The programme in-
eluded every local artist of importance, and their
doings embodied one act of “The Guv’nor,”
the scene from “Julius Ciesar,” in which
Mr. Rignold declaimed over the remains of the
deceased, and many other things. Mr. Rignold
leaves for England to foregather with Brother
Bill and other old friends when “Joseph of
Canaan ” has got to the end of its season, but he
promises to return by-and-bye and renew the
struggle once more. His 61 years or thereabouts
sit so lightly upon him that he will probably keep
his word, and enter on another 20 years’ Austra-
lian experience, and be younger at the end of it
than he is now. The general impression is that
G.R. is immortal.
** * *
This week’s double bill at Melb. Princess’s
is not sufficiently polished to reflect new glory
upon the comic opera co. “Nitouche,” when
Nellie Stewart played the convent damsel, had a
little something of French frivolity in its senti-
ment.. Miss Juliet Wray reproduces many of
Nellie s accents, gestures and poses, and her
mimetic performance is full of natural talent for
the stage. But the difference between the person-
alßies of the old artist and the new is vast. The
£r Hi n- tin o 89 ’ eleßanCH ’ r °guishness and dimphs of
Nellie Stewart are missing from the present imita-
tion or, at least, the present writer can’t see
them. It is hard for a Gentile to imagine Miss
Wrays Nitouche could pass for an artless
creature with the lady superior of any blessed
convent, or to believe that she has had a course of
convent training. Her affected humility and
demureness are as unconvincing as the aspect of
the three high-kickers who wear Salvation Harmy
garb in In Town.” Yet there is no getting
away from the fact that Miss Wray has a charm
for her own people. No young actress could be
more distinctly a matter of taste. Her vivacity is
magnetic, or somewhat vulgar, her voice sweet or
(at times) bleaty, her appearance attractive or
otherwise. Opinions vary from one extreme to
the other on all these points. Miss Wray seems
to be universally admired by Hebrews—she is, in
fact, Williamson and Musgrove’s bid for a sec-
tarian vote, and as a stroke of policy this intelli-
gent, effervescent, typical Australian Jewess must
be reckoned a genuine success. George Lauri
makes the farcical organist of last year a wilder
caricature than before ; also “Ni touche ” has
become a rougher joke in other respects.
* * *
Plumpton’s “operetta,” “An Arcadian
Eve,” turns out to be a weary fragment, and the
incidental music has no grip in it. A young
married man buys an Aladdin ring, wherewith a
Greek god and goddess are summoned to his sit-
ting-room. The young husband hugs the goddess
after which domestic matters are squared by the
discovery that his wife is flirting with Apollo
As soon as the husband agrees to relinquish his
bit of jewellery the two immortals retire through
cardboard doors in the parlor wall. There is
room for stage effects in this ancient, fish-like idea
but since it isn’t worth the expense of super-
natural arrivals and departures, Miss Florence
It oung and Wallace are merely presented in the
form of modern masqueraders who have cut pas-
sages through the scenery. Miss Pollard and
lapley play the prosaic couple doomed to receive
them, the voices of the immortals being much
more powerful than those of the foggy-chested
worldlings of to-day.
The last five nights of this fugitive opera
season start on Saturday with “Paul Jones.”
“Dorothy ” and “ The Mikado ” to follow,

Walter Baker’s determination to win the
Theatre Royal Steeplechase, or break his neck,
nearly brought about a catastrophe, the other
night. The Duke fell heavily at the last hurdle,
and the jockey who does duty for Walter gut a
reasonable chance to roll lifeless into the big
drum’s lap. Fortunately this counterfeit hero
escaped with a shaking on the rnattressed margin
of the water-juinp. The Duke, somehow, didn’t
lose the event. The judge’s box is passed before
they reach the final obstacle, so whenever the
favorite comes a cropper he can be remounted
between the acts, and his number goes up all the
same. Nothing save the Duke’s sudden and un-
mistakeable death ere the curtain had time to fall
would embarrass the plot of “The Prodigal
Daughter.’’ Bland is announced to close his
season on Saturday, when a mighty multitude
will push iiito the Royal and expect him to relieve
his feelings with a speech,
** * *
Little Alma Gray, the Sakers, Slade Mur-
ray, D’Arcy Stanfield, “a daring dive from the
dome,” and a few new jokes are leading features
at Melb. Opera House just now. Take it for all
in all, the Rickards show is rather less soothing
to a troubled spirit than it used to be a month
ago, or will be, probably, four weeks hence. But
the programme takes as long as usual to unfold
itself, and business always assumes bloated pro-
portions on Saturday night,
** * *
At Melb. Cambridge, manager Percy St.
John seems to deserve encouragement in spite of
his dudelike name. The first part contains
joyously idiotic choruses, and some of the per-
formers have brought with them the recommenda-
tion of a long absence from Melbourne. A long-
absent nigger diffuses an air of freshness vainly
sought in the nigger who has long been riveted
to the neighborhood. There ought to be an
Act of Parliament compelling corner men to stay
away at fixed intervals for years at a stretch. A
burlesque, of doubtful origin, professes to be tbe
backbone of the Cambridge revels, and an intelli-
gent orchestra under Harcourt Lee’s guidance
floods the little forest of legs with crimson melody.
Man while a great attraction is mysteriously pro-
mised for Saturday next.

Miss Jennings Carmichael (a lucky suitor
lately induced her to take the name of Mrs.
Mnllis) contributed verse to the Melb. weeklies
long before her beautiful dark eyes had pierced
the heart of man. She was a maiden of 12, catch-
ing inspiration from the wild Gippsland country,
nigh the Snowy River, when the earliest outpour-
ings of her muse trickled into print. From that
time until now the subject of this notice has been
a welcome visitor to the Poets’ Corner in the
Australasian and elsewhere, and a collection of
her verses will shortly be launched on the London
market. “ Hospital Children,” a little book pub-

the fruits of her two years’ experience as a trained
nurse, for which profession she was the first Vic-
torian girl to qualify herself with a certificate.
The Bulletin's photo, of this earnest worker and
charming example of literary womanhood is
apropos of her forthcoming dehut as a lecturess.
At the Masonic Hall, Melb., on Wednesday next
(Sept. 18th), Miss Carmichael will discuss “The
Spirit of the Bush,” a spirit congenial to her own.
The lecturess, who hopes to get through her por-
tion of the entertainment in 40 minutes, is to be
introduced by the eloquent Deakin in a young-
Australian strain, and the second half of an
interesting programme will comprise Australian
songs and recitations by Ida Osborne, Eloise Juno,
and other artists identified with the soil. Also,
Australia’s flag has promised to float proudly over
the proceedings, and a modest scale of prices will
bring “The Spirit of the Bush ” within the reach
of all who would like an introduction.

Mrs. Brown Potter still talks gushingly about “ the
young men of Sydney” who made her promise to cable
the one word “Victory,” as soon as she had can led
London by storm, “ that they might be happy with her.”
Sydney’s gilded youth, during the prolonged waiting tor
Mrs. P.’s shout of triumph, have learned to be tolerably
happy without her.
Juliet Flegeltaub Wray owes much of her knowledge of
stage business to the fact that she is a cousin and familiar
friend of Florence Young. Both girls, up to the present
season, were enthusiastic barrackers for the St. Kilda
Football Club.
Pro.: “Flegeltaub is an infinitely better stage-name
than Wray, and I advise our prima-douna incontinently
to go back on herself, like Hayden Coffin. Nothing takes
in Condon like some designation quite out ol the way, like
Coffin, May Yohd, or Flegeltaub.
Juliet Flegeltaub Wray’s engagement with "the
Finn s” Comic Opera Co. is for a year. After that she
has high notions about studying under Marches! for grand
opera. They all do it now.
Rathhone, one of the beauteous Rathbone sisters
of tableaux-vivants fame, was married immediately on her
relurn to England to a Condon man, to whom she had
become engaged prior to leaving for Australia. Charming

Maggie Stirling, like Marie Elster, is a fine singer who
has wasted the best years of her life in Australia, whilst
several very mediocre youngsters were being sent’Ome
to make names which never became known. Miss Stirling
is a rather erratic timester, but her voice and way of
using it are excellent.
The luck of Haddon Chambers has been in the London
nVm! n 'v 8 strikingly unreal plays. A recent revival of

pany.
Little Muriel Carr, who was brought out from ’Ome by
the Dacres as their “delightful ingenue,” is plaving chief

Apart from a tendency to stand-over at the knees, Miss
Mmiel is a cheerful identity in tights, and she has a nice,

Oracle Dudley, who has been playing Nancy in
The New Boy,” round the English provinces, “was
bom in Melbourne, and at the age of eight vent on the
stage there, playing many parts, including the page in
Hugh ton and ‘Little Lord Fauntieroy,* It was only
last Christmas that she came over to England ” (London

Now, when and where in Meih, did she play the characters
mentioned, and who is Miss Gracie Dudley, anyway ?
A long y arn about Lonnen, the Dreary One, appears in
a Hinghsh “ scraps ” paper, without a word of reference
to his Australian engagement. Another 111 tie weekly is
glad to hear that the Kendals’ son, Dorringlon Grimston
Donington, of the B. and B. Co., is getting on famously
as an actor in touth Africa. This country seems to have
no theatrical existence so far as British journalism is con-
cerned. A few writers remember that Melba is Austry-
Imn by birth, but they evidently assume that she came
Ome many years ago, because there were no white
audiences to appreciate her in her native land.

Palmer was persuaded to go recently ; but she broke up

The cause of her mirth was a message from Dr. Mother-
well “ to be sure and eat plenty of garlic.”
K.yrle Bellew is alleged to have been pitching ttum
some tall narratives of ids youthful days in Australia.
After landing at Melbourne, he walked 500 miles to the
new diggings at Yugilvar Reefs, and had the good luck
(in conjunction with a friend) to strike a reef, containing
gold quartz. The reef seems to have been rather tougher
than Kyrley and his friend had expected, so they took
three other men into partnership and worked the claim
for a year, after which they sold out to speculators for
195,000. The gorgeous one, however, “invested his
share in other undertakings and lost it all.” so he wa<
reduced to clearing timber off 500 acres at ninepence an
acre. With his 500 ninepeiices he built a ferry-boat, and
ran a cemetery', w here business was so brisk, owing to an
epidemic, that the police contracted with him to get the
victims buried on reduced terms. And so on.
Lena Salinger, late of Australia, was married lately in
Montana, U.S., during a play, “ by r a real priest.” This
,s the second time a marriage has taken place on the
stage. The other case was when Louise Pomeroy married
An bur Elliott, in “ Romeo and Juliet,” at Ballarat.
Bland Holt, in “Saved from the Sea": “ Procrastina-

Australia’s musical galaxy: Melba, Amy Sherwim

female instrumentalist. Victoria has come off much the
best of the Australian provinces.
The Meih. show-places flourishing at Xmas, 1869, were
Kreitmayer’s waxworks, the Theatre Coniique, Wtston’s
Opera House, Apollo Hall, Duke of Edinburgh Theatre,
and the Theatre Royal. The latter under the manage-
ment of Harwood, Stewart, Hennings, and Coppin, who
to-day are, all of them, as much alive as their old house.
That clever Australian actress, Annie Mayor, whose
Dora, in “ Diplomacy,” will not he forgotten by anyone
who saw it, has arrivi <1 in London from America. Miss
Mayor has not troubled to keep tier name before the Aus
Italian public during her two years’ absence, but it is
plain from notices which have from time to time reached
Tun Bulletin that she has si cured an excellent position
in her profess ion.
E.: Hilda Spong is the newest recruit to the army of
cyclists. While “resting,” prior to joining B. and 8.,
she has been assiduously practising the machine, and her

the generously curved and beauteous Hilda clings to the
skirt. Twas ever thus. The calveless one alone steps into
the breeches.—
It is said that) Geraldine Olliffe entirely forgets a part
wilen she has ceased playing it. Mrs. Tanqueray, on Ihe
last night of the season, meant almost a fresh study,
though she hart played it but a short time previously.
Dion Boucioault's knowledge of furniture and bric-a-
brac is unrivalled in Australia. In producing a new piece
—more especially it it tie costume—VVallachs are worried
to death with his insistence that every detail shall be of the
period represented. And before leaving a town he must
know the whereabouts of everything. Once he turned
out all the baggage merely to satisfy himself as to a miss-
ing candlestick.
Forbes Robertson, the latest Romeo, is quite old
enough to understand the character. About 45, probably.
Fitzgerald Brothers’ talking horse does sums by rapping
out the numbers necessary. The trainer, Proba»co, also
claims for him the power of mind-reading, so H at if
numbers are written on a slate in the audience the horse
raps them out on the stage with bis hoof. Another feature
of this clever animal is his attachment to his trainer,
whom be follows about. One evening Probasco and a
friend entered a London hotel, amt went up a winding
staircase to a bar above. Being recognised, a conversa-
tion began as to the merits of Mahomnud, and eventually
bets were made with a London Johnny that the horse
would follow Probasco up the winding staircase to the
bar. Probasco went away to the stable, which was close
by, and presently returned, followed by the horse, which
coolly ascended the stairs and turned tip at the bar. The
Johnny was dumbfounded, but paid his bets and sold—
“ Bai Jove, he’s a vewy olevah beast—he knows how many
beans make five." Whereupon Mahommed rapped out
five on the floor. Good yarn.

Hygiene teaches that nothing is so bene-
ficial to the human constitution as thorough
cleanliness, a theory verified by modern revela-
tions of the deadly microbes which infest the
Hesh and blood—especially if we do not keep
ourselves in a clean condition, which ought to be
the first aim of every individual with any esteem
for himself. The use of Amykos has proved to be
very important to this end, by its great sanitary
power over the skin, mouth, teeth, &c. If you

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
September 10, 1895.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
The ball given in Randwick Town Hall last
Thursday, in aid of the St. Vincent de Paul
charity, was redolent of Randwick —the suburb
where turfites most do congregate. The room
looked more like a saddiing-paddock than a town
hall. Sweet charity always leads to the most en-
joyable mixtures, and the most interesting partners
in the crowd were several smart-looking jockeys—
heroes of the hour—whom the society gang present
openly worshipped, with a hungry yearning for a
“moral for the Metrop.” in their eyes, regardless
of the well-known saying anent jockeys’ tips.
But, so far as I heard, the light-weight sphinxes
acted as sich. The room was cheerfully dressed,
a la “Jolly Japan,” with lanterns and scarlet
umbrellas, and, as the dance was financially a
success, the hon. secs., Mrs. Tom Barlow (in well-
cut white satin brocade and chiffon) and 'Mrs.
M‘Manus (in white silk), together with Mrs.
Leach and Mrs. T. Payten, as hon. treasuresses,
deserve all sorts of congratulations,
“ Take away the tea ; we don’t want tea,” is not
exactly a feminine sentiment ; and the num-
ber of women retailing tea and scones for a
livelihood in more-or-less artistic bun-shops
is not likely to be lessened by the fact that
an attractive society damsel —a daughter of an old
N.S. W. family of deservedly high social position
—who was a ministering angel in the pioneer
society-managed tea-shop has already captured a
swain at the spout, as you might say, in the
person of a young professional man of good pros-
pects. But it is only a fair quid pro quo for a
youth to sternly insist upon marrying the maiden
who destroys him with soda scones and tannin at
high noon. The least she can do is to nuise him
for the rest of his days after having made ducks
and drakes of his digestive organs.
I am sorry to have to say that a good many of
the so-called “society” tea-shops are haunts of
plain living and high winking. It is the bad cook-
ing and the very superior spooning so often and
unavoidably kept on the premises when “lydies ”
are at the helm that sends busy men to grilled
chops, served by a waiter in shirt-sleeves
travelling over a saw-dust floor, with no accessory
coquetries of frilly muslin, curtains and pots of
verdure. And the busy man is right.
The popular manager of a lively theatrical co.
tells a Trilby sort of yarn about an experience he
once had. He was putting a would-be star
through her paces, and, after having tested looks,
voice and all that, naturally expressed a respect-
ful wish to know if the lady was—er —well-enough
supported to go into the ballet, which now and
then presents a forked appearance. Imagine his
consternation (that’s the name he gives it) when
the aspirant in a twinkle revealed a lace petticoat
and a pair of cotton tights and levelled a spirited
if clumsy kick at the managerial nose. She was
engaged, but, strangely enough, never got an inch
beyond the second row. A lady of her capacity
ought to be playing Mrs. Fotiphar by now.
Apropos of Trilby. The fashion of having your
left foot photographed will not, I predict, hook
itself violently on to Australian society, for the
simple reason that boots are narrow and feet are
wide, and bunions and corns grow side by side.
How many women are there who could unveil
their silver pedestal to the profane gaze of a
camera-fiend without the result being reminiscent
of a section of gnarled timber? Echo answers, a
mere handful. Just think what a betrayal of
Bufferings nobly borne—what a tragedy in five
toes it would be if society took off its near-side
boot and got its bare foot photo’d ! How the
arithmetical impossibility of putting five into two
would be refuted as the imprisoned foot came out
with a pop from its narrow Parisian case and
commenced to expand into a palm-leaf fan. No—
Trilby feet-studies won’t be general. So far,
society gets the hoof of its most uncompressed
offspring taken instead—a wealthy Sydney man
having set the fashion.
The planet of the star concert co. (managed by
Mr. Stevens and Mr. Howells) is certainly Mark
Hambourg, the pianist—a lad of 16, with a
Byronic look about his collar and tie, a shock of
darK-brown hair, and a high-strung expression of
countenance. As an artist he is superb— his
exuberant youth favors his fervid, furious style, of
course, and though he has a slap dash way of
mauling the piano, somewhat reminiscent of the
high-action trotter, and, though he makes melody
something like some animals make a hole—that is
to say he burrows into the music with extravagant
gestures—still, all these perfectly natural atten-
dant phenomena suit him very well. I heard him
expounding Beethoven and Ghopin. His touch
suggests the iron hand in the velvet glove, and he
carries his hands like a horseman, well down, in
defiance of the old-fashioned “wrists arched”
theory. He is a great artist, undoubtedly—a
boy’s-size Paderewski ; and the women are begin-
ning to worship already—his applause is always
the loudest and strongest. You see he is too
young to have married anybody yet, and women
always encore a bachelor on the off-chance.
Miss Lily Moody, the contralto, is a loss to the
operatic stage, and shows she grieves for it by
the “ business ” she puts into her platform work.
I like the sonorous contralto quality of herpower-
ful voice, and hers is a free, generous sort of sing-
fulness suggesting reservoirs of lung-power and
melody—a large, good-tempered voice in cordial
agreement with her comic-opera nose. Her articu-
lation is excellent, which is not a vocal virtue of
Miss Evangeline Florence (she studied music at
the same time, and from the same professor, as
Grace Palotta, who was greatly interested in her
Australian debut), whose sweet, high, true soprano
voice is indeed “ bird-like,” for 1 never met any-
body yet who could tell me what Dickey was
piping about—have you? Nevertheless, Miss
Florence is a great success, ranging to F in alt.,
which she sings with a pure, silvery intona-
tion. She has graceful movements and a re-
fined stage-presence; and on Saturday morning she
looked very dainty in a muslin gown, with a
romantic pink and black hat. Miss Lily Moody
wore muslin too, with a big black cavalier bat on
one ear and no gloves, so far as I could see. Miss
Moody’s style is as debonair as her voice—a slap-
you-on-the-back sort of a maiden, whom you
instinctively take a liking to. By the way, when
the two lasses took to singing duets, the effect
was reminiscent of locusts and wild honey—Miss
F. as the insect and Miss M. as the other thing.
Mr. Weir assisted the co. with his refined tenor
voice, and Herr Yollmar accompanied at what
was in every way a bright, first-class concert.
Apropos of concerts, at a recent rather good
sample of the genus, the real audience was enter-
tained by the suggestive behaviour of a couple of
men, who stamped in at an inopportune moment,
took a seat in the front row. and began to wildly
entertain one another with loud conversation,
under the very eyes of the performers. Then,
when their conversational powers ran out (which
happened very soon, of course) one man settled
himself with studied carelessness, and, drawing
out a newspaper, folded it exactly to his liking
and remained buried in its columns for the rest of
the evening. He suggested a man who hasn’t
got any light—not even a candle in a bottle—like
Weary Willie, who absorbs his mental pabulum
by lamp-post light. Still, people who only come
in for warmth and shelter ought to get a little
further back.
The Gaiety Co. put up “In Town” again at
Sydney Lyceum last Saturday, in front of the
usual fluttering, chatty, restless, humming, first-
night Lyceum dress-circle, which was just a
little less full than usual. There are lots of
smart sayings “In Town,” I believe —I nearly
caught one, only just as I thought I had it
a fat lady behind me, who kept beating her beaded
breast with a palm-leaf fan—thump, rattle, like a
penitent doing peccavi—called out to a friend four
seats away that “a nasty tomcat ate four of the
chicks, only out last Wednesday,” and the friend
(who had bell bracelets on and sounded like a
dust-cart) replied, in good carrying tones, that
“children were safer than chickens; cats never
ate them.” Whereupon the whole company
laughed outright and waited for a retort from
Beads. She was silent (barring the rattle of her
trimmings), and 1 had almost got to the hang of
“ some do it this way,” when an avalanche fell
over me from the starboard in the shape of a large
fat man in a boiled shirt, who caught his patent-
leather feet in my flounce, and apologised most
loudly and handsomely, and then found he was
jammed unless I rose and folded my seat, which I
did at once, of course ; but, by the time he had
fallen into the aisle and disturbed the whole
colony of people sitting on the steps (who all had
to have their pardons begged), the song was over,
of course.
Decima Moore makes a pretty Kitty Hether-
ington. I wanted to hear the “Romeo and
Juliet ” duet—it looks as if it was really good—
but, just as Bradfield and Decima turned up,
Beads was seized with a mad longing to tell the
dust-cart and the rest (the rest were only aggres-
sive by reason of incessant giggling and strong
mixed perfumes—l didn’t mind ’em all fanning
together and blowing my hair every way) all
about her new hat for the races, which was quite
a poem, trimmed with green bows—sash-ribbon
width—with clusters of cornflowers and diamond
pins. The recital of these glories had the effect
of quieting the rest for a second or so, and I
nearly heard some of the stage dialogue when my
knees were knocked sideways, and the fat man
appeared again with a pair of hired opera-glasses.
He burst past me all right, but found a hitherto
unseen friend in the dust-cart, whose bells rang a
regular peal as she leant all over a youth sitting
in front of her, and began airy badinage with the
fat man, who of course dropped the sweets he was
carrying, which scattered every way, and made
everybody choke with laughter. Then—but I
mean to continue this at the earliest opportunity.
You get a lot of it at the Lyceum, and lam in
hope that Mr. Williamson will engage Fritz
Rimma to stay behind in Australia and throw
out the magpie brigade—especially on Saturday
nights—with great violence.
The most impressive thing about “The Judge '
at Sydney Criterion was the sure and certain fear
everybody felt that Kate Bishop would be caught
and thrown back into her dungeon in the last act,
directly the female policeman took the chase in
hand. The awful fact of woman’s inhumanity to
woman was never more glaringly brought home
to a guilty dress-circle. Apart from these
gloomy suggestions, “The Judge” is a brightly-
dressed, well-staged nightmare. Harrie Ireland’s
principal frock was a blue satin, cut below high-
modesty mark, and terminating in a pair of blue
shoes, while Madge Corcoran sports a cream satin
Empire gown, which every young matron should
rush to get a pattern of. Miss Kate Bishop (who
got a good reception) wore black all through the
piece, but William Elton’s attire principally con-
sisted of a blanket and a pair of bare legs.
But masculine legs are a farthing a dozen on
the stage —so far as thrill goes. There is nothing
exciting about the revelation of a pair of male
pins, which are always with us, as you may say.
Man is a bifurcated animal every day of his life—
even the most unsophisticated child of nature
doesn’t think that he terminates in a merman’s
tail—and it doesn’t cause a very howling sensa-
tion if he goes a step further and takes off his
boots and socks. Now, if the foot-bath incident
occurred to “ Matilda ” instead of “John” what
a thrill it would create, to be sure ! There was an
appreciative house for the first night, including a
box full of ladies who powdered their noses
during one of the waits with a puff the size of a
snowball.
Lately, within a few days of one another, two
greatly - respected citizens of Sydney passed
off the scene for ever—Mr. W. H. Paling,
whose magnificent gift of the Carington Hospital
property at Camden, together with a cheque for
ten thousand pounds, provide a lasting monument
to his memory better than all the “ storied urns ”
in the world ; and Mr. Henry Wise (inevitably
nicknamed “Penny ” Wise), a trustee of N.S.W.
Savings Bank. Mr. Wise was an authority on
matters of Art, though he refrained from bearing
office in any of the societies.
Next week will be a festive whirl in Sydney,
what with races, visitors, new Spring fashions,
and evening parties. The A. J.O. Spring meeting
commences to-day (Saturday), and is to be con-
tinued Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, and, in
between, comes the ever-lively polo Gymkhana at
Kensington racecourse (P. O’Mara, secretary);
a reception, given by Major-General and Mrs.
Hutton, to meet the Victorian Commandant and
Lady Holled-Smith ; and balls and hops galore,
given by Government House, the Australian
Club, and other tried hosts. Taking it altogether,
any society person who doesn’t know how to
whiz had better flee into the mountains, or go to
Coolgardie until this annual burst of frivolity
peters out.
With the racing season almost quite ripe, it was
no small-sized treat to me to have the privilege,
the other morning, of going over Newmarket —
the well-appointed stables at Randwick, where the
lengthy and amiable “ Tom ” Payten looks after
the high-priced gee-gees run by “J. B. Clark.”
The surprising feature about all these beautiful
thoroughbreds, without exception, is their doci-
lity. They all behave perfectly, and take as much
wholesale petting as so many babies. I saw the
imported Fitz Donovan, a son of the English
Derby winner, Donovan. He is a most artistic-
looking nag, of an uncommon, coppery-sorrel
sort of color, with a mane like a lion’s. When he
arrived from England he was a most pronounced
rogue, but now he is as amiable as the rest. I
saw Mrs. James White’s darling Coil, a son of
Abercorn, with a market value high in the
thousands, and I saw old Autonomy having a
rest after his many triumphs—l saw everything, in
fact—all the equine heroes past, present, or to
come, which are domiciled at Newmarket. The
stables look like a ball-room —polished wood for
the stall-doors; all the brasswork as bright as a
ship’s; beautifully-swept asphalt floor ; a balcony
all round, and above that a lofty dome. You
could pass the “Newmarket” nags in review
in a light silk dress and satin shoes.
A batch of new music lately received includes
the“Epacris” waltz, by Darrell Bensusan, It
is a most tuneful and excellent dancing waltz—
every moment is pretty and the tempo is smoothly
sustained throughout. From Gordon and Gotch
comes a rollicking sort of paraphrase of “ His
Heart was true to Poll,’’called “ True to Nell,” by
Harvey Barnett, words by W.G.S. to the effect
that the frantic wiles of strange ladies are thrown
away on a gentleman whose heart is allegedly
true to Nell; but the awful ignorance of feminine
foibles displayed in the lines, “ Your hair is
charming I must own, but Nell's you ought to see,"
spoils the whole thing. Any man so ignorant as
to ask a girl to acknowledge the superiority of a
rival’s back hair would probably never have a
Nell to be true to. The music is rattling. From
W. D. Johnstone and Co. comes a polka, “The
B. and 8.,” by Amy Armstrong. The polka is
an obsolete dance just now, so it seems rather a
waste of musical energy to write music for
it; still, if there is anybody anywhere who
dances the polka “The B. and B.” may be re-
commended for coming down with the necessary
thump.
Talking about music, Maud FitzStubbs (who
will probably go on a South African concert-tour
with her old master, Giorza, ere returning to Aus-
tralia) seems to be going forward in London. The
“Heather Waltz ” was played at a State ball at
Buckingham Palace ; and at a ladies’ night at the
Gallery Club, Maud and Madeline FitzStubbs
played the “Heather” as a duo ; appearing again
in another duo, “Nocturne in F,” by Maud afore-
said. Both ladies had a good reception.
My Melb. correspondent writes ;
“ The only detail of the part of Rosette that did
not fit May Pollard like a glove was the raiment
in the second act. An economical management
had evidently designed that Nellie Stewart’s
mantle should literally descend on May’s broad
shoulders, with the result that the observant eye
detected at once that it cramped Rosette 11.
across the chest, was inches too long in the waist,
and altogether had a hand-me-down look about it.
The robe de nuit, as worn by May, is a degree
more actual than was her predecessor’s, which is
saying a good deal.
“ Melb. women have, with one consent, shrouded
themselves in black crepon. One would imagine,
from a walk down the Block, that everyone was in
mourning for some national calamity. But that’s
characteristic ; no sooner does a style have a vogue,
here than it becomes a uniform. At a fashionable
garden-party last week nearly every female, young
or old, married or single, wore black crepon, with
most depressing effect. Certainly, they endea-
vored to lighten the gloom by hats of bewilder-
ing hues, but with small success. The blade gown
per se is becoming and natty, but, in crowds, it is
sombre and inartistic.
“At the first Melb. concert of the Star Co.,
Miss Evangeline Florence was taken ill, and a
doctor summoned to the performer’s room. Medi-
cus made himself agreeable by condoling with the
musicians on the poor attendance and the empty
balcony. ‘ Don’t trouble yourself,'replied Mark
Hambourg, cheerfully, ‘l’ll bring the people!’
And he did.
“ At the Wednesday afternoon concert in Melb.
TownHall.theyouthfulMaxsuccessfullyperformed
a f< at never before attempted here and seldom in
the world. In a composition of Chopin’s occurs
a of prestissimo passages to be played in
octave chords by both hands. The are so
difficult and the passages so rapid that Frederic
himself could only manage single notes in the
bass. This piece of dexterity fairly caught musi-
ca' Melb. by the hair of the head, and from henoe-
forth sixteen-year-old Max will be spoken of as
greatest pianist who ever shook his long hair
' n the Melb. public’s face.
“Vic. vice-regal balls follow one another so
hurriedly that very select people are privately
glad Gov. Brassey will soon cry ‘Over ! ’ ‘Seats
free—everybody invited,’ might have been the
motto of the last function, where more debutantes
hot-housed into celebrity sat all night in a flat,
forlorn row against the wall, and kept up a heart-
breaking pretence of ‘ enjoying myself so much,
thank you.’ His Waxcellency again wore his
court suit; and Lady Holled Smith—Smell-
bourne’s only ‘garrison belle’—shimmered sump*
tuously in scarlet poppies.
“ Mrs. Frank Stephen gave a new notion of in-
expensive dressing by a close-fitting, black-velvet
skirt and mauve-silk bodice, with a breast-plate of
silver lace. Mrs. Albert Miller, as an exponent
of light and leading, appeared in an aesthetic com-
bination of greys; and Mrs. F. T. Sargood, in plain
black silk and spectacles, lent severity to a parti-
cularly emphatic set of lancers. Miss Berry gave
the rightful setting to damask cheeks -and dark
e y es with an Empire robe of pale-yellow silk,
But the quaintest spectacle was Baron Von
Mueller, with his chest court-plastered with orders
and a long and dingy comforter trailing from his
coat-pocket to the ground.
“No one accuses the Maddens of saving out of
the vice-regal allowance. During the regime,
everyone autographing the visitors’ book has been
promptly rewarded by an invitation, a state of
things most conducive to loyalty.
“ Lecturer Naylor, the latest addition to the
Ormond College (Melb.) staff, has a sweet tenor
voice which wins enthusiastic approval from Prof,
Marshall-Hall. The young classic’s social gifts
and graces endear him equally to local maidens,
who prefer to discredit the rumor of his engage-
ment to Miss Faber, of the B. and B. Co. Mr.
Naylor’s alleged fiancee shares his knack of popu-
larity and has hosts of girlfriends—notably the
Acting-Governor’s daughters,
“ A suburban lady, daughter of a late Melb.
Chamber of Commerce magnate, is to be married
in a day or two to Hon. John Wallace, the
leviathan mining speculator and reputed million-
aire. There is a difference of 55 years between
the ages of the bride-elect and her fiancd, who
has a family by a former marriage, and celebrated
his 70th birthday a few years ago. The late Mrs.
Wallace had been a Miss Monaghan, and that
splendid Swanston-street block opposite St. Paul’s
Cathedral, known as ‘Monaghan’s buildings,’ is
now held in trust for her children, one of whom,
a pretty girl of 12, is looked upon with interest as
the catch of the future. The bride-elect is a
talkative young lady, much addicted to hymn-
singing and harmonium-playing at seamen’s
mission-meetings and church working-bees.
“At the opening of a South Yarra fete Lady
Holled Smith paralysed the locals with the second
of lier R ose lla hats. This was of the brightest
turquoise-blue satin, with big, upstanding, gold-
spangled yellow lace‘wings; long green grasses
and white blossoms at the back, magenta % roses
and violets in the front. Even the hilarious red
of her silk blouse couldn’t dominate this particulai
hat.
“Lady Holled is the latest Melb. fashion-
able woman who has taken to bicycling. The
bike subjected to the task of carrying her has no
sinecure. The lady of the wondrous hats has
golden hair and pink-all-over complexion, and
she wears white gloves on nearly all occasions.
“ A private letter states that the birdlike Lalla
Miranda, now in Paris studying French, makes
her debut in grand opera early in December,
opening with ‘ Lucia di Lammermoor.’
“ An Australienne, writing from ’Ome, says-
< When j was in Brussels, a short time ago, I saw
Mabel Lane, the pretty daughter of Mrs. Lane,
late hostess of the Melb. City Club Hotel, per-
forming with one of the Lauri family at the Alca-
zar. Mabel cer tainly Mid not act much, but
Brussels raved about her, by reason of her glorious
Irish-grey eyes and beautiful figure. They call her
‘La belle Larney,’ which is as near as they can
come to the pronunciation of her name.’ ”
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
The Redfeni railway disaster has (apart
from costs) cost New South Wales .£34,361
in damages awarded to 33 claimants or
their relatives. The total claims amounted to
£167,469, so that Supreme Court juries have
discounted them by £133,137, or about four-fifths.
The largest sum paid was £6,100 to Dr. Maher,
who claimed £30,000; but other claimants for
£30,000 got nil, and in not one case was there
awarded anything like the amount asked-for.
The policy of the Railway Commissioners in
settling only the most moderate claims out of
court, and expediting the suits by admitting
liability and leaving only the question of damages
for decision, has been thoroughly justified, for it
is hardly likely the claimants would have volun-
tarily reduced their demands by four-fifths, how-
ever persuasively approached. And there seems
no reason to question the absolute fairness of the
awards on the whole; especially when it is con-
sidered that it is only by aet of grace and Act of
Parliament that the country is liable at all, and
that there is no real reason why any individual
should not be expected to insure himself against
railway risks (not due to culpable negligence) be-
fore he takes a railway journey,

The B. L. Corto Fabrica de tabacos (which
means a Havanna cigar-factory) thus advertises
its Rothschild cigars I The tobacco from which
our cigars are made is grown entirely in conserva-
tories, and the cigars are made on mahogany and
marble tables by thoroughbred artists in swallow-
tail coats and white kid gloves. When a man
smokes one of these cigars he simply walks on air,
and dreams that he has a ten-carat diamond scarf-
pin, and a ten-guinea suit of clothes on, and just
married “ rich.” They make the teeth sweet and
the breath white, and will force a moustache on
the smoothest lip in a few years. They improve
and beautify the complexion, eradicate tan,
freckles, dandruff on all baldheads. They per-
meate the house, window curtains, and clothes
with the exquisite odour and delicate fragrance of
heliotrope, new-mown hay and jockey-club. No
well-regulated family can properly keep house
without a box of the B. L. Corto Rothschild
cigars, for the man who smokes them will never
swear, or join a club, or want his own way
“always.” After cremation the ashes of these
cigars are the most powerful concentrated tooth-
powder yet discovered. The B. L. Corto Roths-
child are obtainable at all respectable tobacconists
in Australasia, price 6d each.*

Re the Chinese-mission industry. In
Melbourne some girls (ranging from sixteen years
up), belonging to decent families, engage in
“single teaching ” — i.e., they privately instruct
individual Chows. At a certain recent semi-
public examination, one nice-looking and enthu-
siastic girl, proud of the progress of the almond-
eyed pupil whom she was rescuing from kite-flying
and Joss - worship, loudly exclaimed, to the
disgust of some well-instructed white men : “My
Samuel has got on splendidly ! ’’ “My Samuel 1 ”

The agitation among the conductors on the
Ocean-street (Sydney) cable trams has an air of
mystery about it. The employes ha ve not struck,
nor pilfered, perhaps, nor killed anyone ; yet the
authorities are sacking, disrating, and trans-
ferring said conductors. The men profess ignor-
ance of the cause. The gripmen are untouched —
only the conductors are “ made examples of.’’ It
is generally believed that petticoats and secret ap-
pointments are at the bottom of the trouble. In
every Australian city the tram-conductor is the
gayest of Lotharios. Perhaps it’s the brass
buttons; But opportunity is everything. The
conductor is privileged to speak to a “Lydy” every
time she cables it in or out of town ; and if he is a
very nice conductor, young and polite, and comely,
the “ Lydy ” soon gets to be on at least as friendly
terms with him as Bridget is with her vegetable-
John.

A well-known firm of Adelaide solicitors
lost one of its most respected clients a while
ago. Deceased was such a nice man that the firm
sent a partner to follow the funeral, and be visibly
affected when the actual interment took place.
It was reckoned a gratuitous act of sympathy on
the part of sorrowing legal adviser* until the
widow’s executors got a bill-of-costs from Flint
and Stealey. On the bill was a modest item of
-G1 Is. for “attendance at grave,” although the
firm charged nothing for its silent tear.

M‘G. : A question for the W.C.T.U.,
whieh assumes every woman an icicle shattered,
not thawed, by the berroot man. How is it that
the average girl, in choosing a fancy-ball cos-
tume, so often takes a character possessing no
“character” at all? In a recent Australasian
is presented a page of thirteen sassiety damsels
as they appeared at Acting-Gov. Madden’s fancy
ball, and of this number five arrayed themselves
as Princess de Lamballe, Lady Hamilton, Lady
Teazle, La Fri vole and Ma Mie Rosette. Oneof the
two historical personages mentioned was deci-
dedly “off-color,” while the three others of fiction
carry with them a host of blushful associations
and situations. Where is the man who would
dare to stroll up in the costume of Don Juan?
While they are at it, the W.C.T.U. might also
explain why nine women out of every ten, in
writing up a confession-album, always give some
extremely naughty female as their favorite
character in history; Who has not turned over
the pages of one of these volumes and seen Mary,
Queen of Scots, on every other page ?

aware of the truth of “ J. P.” Dormer’s strictures
on J.’s.P. generally, and especially in regard to
Melb. District Court, the fact remains that Mr.
Dormer himself, an avowed aggressive teetotaller,
only attends that tribunal on Thursdays—the day
on which licensing cases are heard. Mr. L finer
certainly explains this coincidence in a perfectly
clear manner, and nobody who knows the man
would doubt his word ; still, an ordinary sense of
decency should prompt him to steer clear of
adjudicating on subjects touching which he bolds
such pronounced and, to the lay mind, exaggerated
views. ,

Attorney-General Isaacs had the conscience
to drop heavily upon a couple of Victorian magis-
trates the other day. A clerk of petty sessions
pleaded guilty to a charge of embezzlement,
whereupon two honorary justices, overruling the
P.M. in the chair, inflicted a small fine upon the
clerk, and sent him rejoicing on his way. Isaacs,
horrified at such an extraordinary proceeding,
called for their resignations. All things eon-
sidered, Attorney-General Isaacs displayed a rash
spirit in this incident. He didn’t allow for the
chance of it becoming generally known in Mel-
bourne, where two embezzling clerks of a very big
legal firm lately pleaded guilty, without getting
themselves, or anybody else, into trouble. Ihe
junior clerk threw himself upon the mercy of the
P. \f. and was sentenced to a small fine ; the
senior clerk faced Judge Hood, in the Grim.
Court, and was —released on his own recognisance
OUR REPTILE CONTEMPORARY.
SCHOOL INSPECTOR (at Dandaloo): “The historian seems to have enter-
tained a very mean opinion of his contemporaries. Now, what
is a ‘ contemporary? ”
YOUNG STUBBS (whose father takes the “Star”): “Please, sir, an
'Evennin' Noose,' sir.”
The moral of this story sticks right out. It is
beautifully obvious. The P.M., the Judge, and
Isaac Isaacs ought to send in their resignations,
if the two country justices were righteously dealt
with.

“ Thank: Heaven, she's no daughter of minel"

they are “ demoralising.” The literary authority
which issues this astonishing decision is presum-
ably Warder Smith, or Jones the turnkey, or the

Bumbledom. Because, a hulking person of no

Dear Bulletin, —How is it that one of
Sydney’s large hospitals—largely subscribed to by
the public—is apparently run in the interest of a
certain clique? Nearly the whole of the honorary
medical staff is composed of men with a Scotch
qualification, and though honorary, these appoint-
ments are much sought after, being a very good
ad vt. 1 n Melbourne the subscribers elect the staff;
in Sydney the election lies with a favored few. Only
a few days since an extra specialist in the hos-
pital referred to was requited, and, of course, an
M.D., Edin., was appointed. There were three
Australians, graduates in England, who applied,
but were passed over. By the bye, the successful
applicant holds a similar appointment at another
hospital, thus depriving some brother specialist of
a chance, however small.— Medious.
The wlr between the Scotch and Irish medical
factions threatens to break out again in another
place. Dr. Graham having set afoot a movement
for the establishment of a maternity hospital in
Sydney, Dr. Mac Donnell Kelly writes indignantly
to the press pointing out that such an institution
already exists—at 561 Elizabeth-street, near Cleve-
land-street. “It has a full medical staff, and a
complete course of lectures in midwifery is given
there at stated times. The management is under
a committee of ladies, who are actuated only by
motives of charity, and who receive no remunera-
tion whatever for their services. Once a month a
party, comprising several leading ladies of Sydney,
well-known for their philanthropy, visits the in-
stitution. All classes and creeds are admitted.
There are no questions asked, and everything is
donetoenablepatientsto bear their trouble in peace
and resignation. The home is entirely non-sec-
tarian. and relies for support on the charitable
contributions of the general public, and has never
appealed to the Government for assistance.”

Some W.C.T.U. shriekers called in on
Vic. Education Minister Peacock, the other day,
requesting that moi;e sp ice should be devoted in
the school reading-books to pointing out the evils
of intemperance, tobacco and opium-smoking, and
the use of chloral and chlorodyne, and that one of
their members should be placed on the committee
appointed to draw up the new series of books
That some girls, after they leave school, take to
opium and chloral and cigarettes is, no doubt,
true; the W.G.T.U. doesn’t seem to understand
that old Eden story about the joys of forbidden
fruit, and the inadvisability of showing youngsters
certain fruits’ and then forbidding them. Man
is born to evil, as the sparks fly upward, and
W.C.T.U. shriekers are just about the biggest

overseer of one of these stations lately proceeded
against two men for trespass. The manager had
the bad taste to sit on the Bench and bear the
cases, wherein defendants were fined .£2 or one
month. If the facts are as alleged, then that J.P.
was really hearing his own case. The Bulletin
advises its informant to write to the Minister of
Justice, at the same time communicating with
some M.P. who can be relied on to ventilate the
subject in the Assembly.

medico. On the boss expressing surprise at the
clerk’s willingness to Jose a fortnight's wages, the
enthusiast explained that “ Doctor Soandso is a

child by my wife before I married her.” And,
added the canvasser, “I think it’s every man’s

Dear Bulletin, —“ And honored well are
charms to sell if priests the selling do.” Jessie
Nichols, seemingly slain by the abortionist, adds
one more victim to civilised sham. If there is one
thing worse than aggressive vice, it is aggressive
virtue. The aggressive virtue of her own sex
drove the unhappy girl to her terrible doom. It
was from women’s scorn she fled —poor, foolish
girl, little reflecting that every day thousands of
Respectable women sell themselves at the altar for
various considerations, while but few give them-
selves away, like her, from excess of love.—Pad-

Judge Hartley Williams (Vic.) has just
told a Sunday-afternoon audience as a solemn
truth that he knew a Melb. solicitor who used
every morning and evening of his life to pray to
Providence to send him business. The Judge
reasoned with him, but to no purpose. Likewise,
he knew a barrister who regularly prayed the
Almighty to send him lots of briefs. But the
supplicator who annexes the entire bakery is a
squatter who prays regularly that the Almighty
will strike all rabbits sterile. Then came, after
lots of laughter, this knockdown blow—“ And it’s
just the same with you people when you pray for
rain!” True: if rain is coming, it will come.
If it isn’t coming, you might as well pray for a
shower of iced whisky-and-soda.

Divorce is commonest in cases where the
husband is between 25 and 30 at time of marriage,
and the wife either between 17 and 22 or between
25 and 30. The most divorces of all take place
where both parties at marriage were between 25
and 30. though wives of 19 have a fatal liking for
the process. ....
Among the women, divorces are com-
monest in descending order among housewives,
servants, dressmakers, barmaids, tailoresses,
governesses, actresses, milliners. So that bar-
maids and actresses are not the least moral classes;
lump the dressmakers, tailoresses, milliners — i.c.,
the factory class—and you see what happens to
those who “ go to business.”

bility is one boy and one girl ; but when the sex
is the same it is safe to gamble on their girlhood.

Under the N.S.W. Land and Income-tax Bill,
church lands are wholly exempted from taxation. Also,
ohuruh revenues are exempted from income-tax., Can
anyone tell why, unless it he to secure the votes of the
pious element in the community? The value of property
in N.S.W. (a country in which Stale aid to religion has
ostensibly been abolished) belonging to the Anglican
Church alone-is sat down by Coghlan at £1,243,633, “ ex-
clusive of the value of glebe lands,” whatever they may
amount to. The Presbyterians own £402,000 worth of
property; the Wesleyan Church, £551,000 worth ; Con-
gregational Church, £201,000 worth; Baptist Union,
£65,000 ; Roman Catholic Church, not given, so
far ns the writer can find out, but probably
about £BOO,OOO, judging by the statistics available
when compared with those of the Anglican Church.
Altogether, allowing for the smaller sects, church pro-
perty in N.S.W. probably represents £3,500,000, and of
this it may be roughly estimated that one-half would
come under the operation of the Land-tax. If there is
any reason why all this mass of property should be ex-
empt, while that of life assurance societies, which mostly
represents the scanty provision made for the widow and
the orphan, is not—apart from the reason that the church
kicks 20 times harder about parting with its money than
any mere worldly instititution is capable of doing—it
ought to be explained forthwith. Soul-insurance societies
should pay their fair whack.

At a meeting of the Maoriland Midland Rail-
way Co., held recently in London, a number of people
complained bitterly of “ the methods pursued towards
those who were foolish enough to embark lh°ir capital in
a venture which was started for the benefit of a oreat
English colony." The spectacle of a crowd of British
capitalists professing that they started building a railway
from purely philanthropic motives and for the benefit of
somebody else is good. John Bull is about the only
person on earth who has the gall to say things like that.

The Vic. Govt, claims that when a man’s
endowment-policy matures and he collects the money, it
forms part of his income for the year, and must pay
income-tax. Naturally, the taxpayer kicks violently.
When a man’s endowment policy matures it means that
he has paid his money into the insurance office for a
certain number of years, and has finally drawn it nut
with the accumulated interest. If he drew his accumu-
lated savings out of the savings bank it would be part of
his income for the year when he drew it out, in exactly
the same fashion. The Government also wants to charge
income-tax on legacies, and as these also pay legacy-duty
another strong objection arises. V\ hen the old man
dies, and leaves, perhaps, £5500 as his total assets, and
the law makes the widow pay sundry legal charges and
stamp-", and takes £B2 10s. for succession-duty, it seems
a brutal case of “ rubbing it in ” to also charge income-
tax on the whole £5500 on the ground that it is her
revenue for the year.

The balance-sheet of the Union Bank, just pub-
'ished, shows that the net profits for the past half-year
w-re only £37,173, and as even the reduced div. at the
r te of 5 per cent, per annum absorbed £37,500, it was
necessary to ta v e|£327 from profit and loss account to make
it up. Assuming tha f the bank made absolutely nothing
out of its deposits and note circulation, the above profit
r 'presents ra'her less than 3 per cent, per annum on the
-hareholders’ capital and reserve-fund. The expenses, by
"he wav, amount to the large sum of +119,198, which is a
heavy burden for even the most solid bank to stagger
under.

The usual pathetic story of the last man who
put in his money before the collapse turns up in con-
nection with the City of Melbourne Bank. An absent-
•nb ded individual, so the tale runs, who didn’t read the
papers and had no idea of what was going on, arrived just
as the directors in the back-room were deciding to give up
'he struggle, and paid in his cash. While he was paying
it in the order came to close np. An obliging messenger
postponed the closure for a few' seconds to let him pass
'mt, and then as he went down the steps the big front
d >or shut with a'orash and his deposit went into lianida-
"ion. Tie crash made him look hack, and the notice
pasted on the door explained the rest. Then he howled
through the keyhole for the return of his money, but
only a hollow echo answered him.

A post has been found for stranded politician
Dlbbs in the managing trusteeship of N.S.W. Savings
Bank, left open by the recent death of Mr. Wise. The
hoard of trustees, who recommended the ex Premier’s
appointment, consists largely of personal friends, though
for that matter it would lie hard to find any public body
which does not consist largely of friends of the ex-
member for Tamvvorth. The salary is £1350 a year, and
Damchioago will doubtless settle into his snug billet with
alacrity—if allowed. For the Ex. Council has to confirm
the appointment, and it is hinted, at time of writing, that
this body will think twice about the matter in view of the
proposed amalgamation of N.S.W. and Post Office Savings
Banks, which will necessitate a re-casting of the whole
scheme of officials and salaries. The ex-Premier would
no doubt manage the hank well, but his appointment is
cruelly rough on the old officials, a steady-going and level-
headed lot, who had naturally hoped for and expected a
step up all round. The Australian politician is like the
great American Pie-biterwhen he reaches out for a pie
that is his pie.

Further information by the mail shows that the
Bank of New Zealand figures were somewhat mixed up in
the original cable intelligence. As far as now appears
the shortage in the B.N.Z. Estates Co. is £911,678, and
there is a deficiency in the bank of £422,281, and a pro-
bable future deficiency of another £200,000; total
£1,533,979. Of this if is expected that £148.000 will be
recovered from tbe Auckland Agricultural Co., and the
balance will be made good by writing off the total paid-up
capital of the hank (£900,000) the reserve-fund (£45,000)
and all the proceeds (estimated at £450,000) of the’ call
made a few months ago. This will leave the B.N.Z. with
no capital whatever, except the £2,000,000 which it re-
cently borrowed on the State’s guarantee, so another
£500,000 is to be called np from the shareholders, and the
State is to take up £500,000 worth of preference shares,
carrying 3J per cent, dividends.
By way of ffivinpr the institution a frpsh start,
the Government undertakes to entrust to it all its London
financial business, estimated to be worth £14,000 a year.
Also, it is claimed that the B.N.Z. will save some £64 000
a year, which has hitherto been drained out of it by ’the
Estates Co. ; £lO,OOO by replacing its 5J per cent.
debentures by 4 per cents., and £15,000 by economies
in the management. The total net profits of the bank
Treasurer Ward estimates at £148,000 a year, which looks
rather too large to be true. Out of ibis £50,000 a year is
to be paid to the Estates Co. so long as may be necessary
to cover anticipated further losses on realisation, and the
property of the co. is to be sold with all possible speed.
This £50,000 is to be a first charge on the profits. Next
the shareholders come in for 5 per cent, dividends oil
their capital of £600,000, provided they pay up that
amount. Third, the Government apparently comes in for
8J per cent, interest on its £500,000 of preference shares,
though why they are called “preference” under such
circumstances is' ditncuit to understand. Any further
profits go to make up the expected losses in the Estates
Co., and if even this doesn’t cover the shortage the
Government guarantees payment of the balance. Under
these conditions the Estates Co. can never again wreck
the 8.N.Z., and when the former is finally wound up in a
year or two the incubus will be gone for good, and the
bank should have an excellent prospect before it. The
Government will probably purchase a lot of the Estates
Co.’s properties for set tlement purposes, and thus hasten
the winding-up. Also, if the present arrangement is
carried out, the B.N.Z. will probably buy up the Colonial,
the shareholders of which have already decided in favor
of amalgamation, and it will then have one of the largest
banking businesses in Australasia.
Meanwhile, according to cabled information, a
small shindy has arisen in London. The British holders
represent 63,000 shares out of 150,000, and some of them
how many doesn’t appear—are demanding liquidation.
Liquidation would certainly cost a great deal more than
fhe proposed reconstruction, expensive as the latter may
be, but the British shareholder—or part of him—appears
to be in an aggressive mood and wants Blood.
The balance-sheet for the year ending 31st
March, shows that the B.N.Z. has made a loss for the
year on its ordinary business of £37.356. One cause,
though a very small one, of this ruinous stale of things
is doubtless that clause in last year’s arrangement,
whereby one-half of the £2,000,000 raised under the State
guarantee had to be kept invested in Government
securities. At present rales this practically meant that
the bank borrowed a million at 4 per cent., and had to
' invest it at about 3£, and lose the difference. Even
allowing for this, however, the results are fully £73,000
worse than those shown for the previous year. The
deposits show a reduction of nearly £1,000,000 ; the note-
circulation declined by £47,000 ; hut the general business
of the bank seems to have been well-maintained, and the
report gives absolutely no information that is calculated
to throw any light on the causes of the loss.
• • • •
Something to think over. Considering that the
two Government ovethauls of the Bank of New Zealand,
which seems to have been as honest as the average, and
its parasite, the Estates Co., revealed shortages of nearly
a million and three-quaiters, and this after the bank had
twice written off large sums to cover losses, what might
happen if a similar overhaul took place of all the Austra-
lian banks, finance companies, and insurance societies?
The possible revelations are too vast for any ordinary
mind to take them in. The orthodox balance-sheet only
professes to show the state of things “ according to the
books,” and the B.N.Z. is a fair example of what, may
happen when the hooks are inspected by a thoroughly
independent authority. When is the State audit system
coming along ?

The power of Drink. During the construction
of the railway from l.ismore to Byron Bay (N.S.W.), one
man, who had taken out a wholesale license, sold 2300
casks of beer in less than 15 months, making a clear profit
of £2ooo—this not including what he made out of spirits,
etc. The beer was all sold by the cask, the vendor think-
ing it too much trouble to sell it two gallons at a time.
When the extension from the Bay to the Tw'eed was
begun the good thing had leaked out, and some sixteen
gentlemen, eager to make a fortune, forked out their
little £2O each. This, of course, cut the business up ; but
it was still good enough.
As the above line neared completion, a man
thought he saw a good thing in a pub. at the Five-mile,
but had no spare cash. He had some property, however,
and on this he borrowed £6O (locally) for license, etc.
From a brewing firm he got £350 cash to build a house,
and £2OO worth of stock. These amounts he agreed to
pay in three months. Wet weather and pay-day com-
bined to assist, and in ten days he paid every cent, he
had borrowed, paid for his stock, and had in hard cash
£257.

Buringbar, 13 miles from Murwillumbah, a two-storey
wooden hotel, with kitchen, two good tanks, range, a
large assembly hall and half acre of ground, situated at

Somewhere about the last but one of the Melb.
boomsters has been soused in bankruptcy. He repre-
sented a quarter of a million in balloony paper.
Broken Hill rejoices over improved prospects
for lead. A year ago the price fell to, say, £9 ss. ; and,
for the second half of ’94, the B.H. Proprietary Co. aver-
aged only £9 12s. To this it had fallen steadily from £l5,
in ’9O. Now, this persistent fall was the very thing that
was not expected ; it was confidently believed that, with
the reduction in the output of lead consequent on the
stoppage of silver-lead mines, especially in America, lead
prices, at any rate, would bound up. Siher, it was recog-
nised, was too heavily shackled wdlh accumulations. The
unexpected downward course was not checked till 10
months ago. Then the accumulation seems to have been
used up, and for the co.’s last half-year the price realised
averaged £9 18s.—an increase of 6s. on the previous half.
By the middle of July the quotation had got up to
£lO 12s. 6d. ; and immediately on the announcement of
the B.H. (ire it moved to £ll 2s. 6d. It steadied to £ll,
and is still quoted at that—" market firm.”
It is impossible to say just how much lead the
Broken Hill mines are producing at present. The bulk of
it is in the sulphides, which are exported either in the
shape of crude ore or as concentrates; and though they
may assay 70 per cent., the quantity that can be ex-
tracted profitably is uncertain. At a Very low estimate,
Broken Hill is now contributing to the lead-market no-
thing short of 2300 tons a week. The advance in lead
value is thus already worth over £4OOO a week to the
B.H. mines. Of this the Proprietary benefits to the
extent of only about £6OO.
It has been decided that Junction North (8.H.)
shares shall rise several shillings yet. The mine is merely
a circumstance. B.H. North promises to earn almost the
same sort of reputation. At the same time, steps are
being taken here to fairly develops the mine, and a small
concentrating mill may shortly be erected for the sul-
phides.
For the week ended Aug. 31, the output of ore
at Broken Hill was 15,000 tons, including over 8000 tons
of sulphides.
British B.H. Co. has had a fair income from the
rent tor its furnaces leased to the B.H. Proprietary. This,
however, may have an end. On past figures it certainly
was more economical for the Proprietary Co. to smelt at
the British, although paying rent, than at its own
furnaces; hence it was thought that, if any furnaces re-
mained idle, it would be the Proprietary’s own southern
nest. A change in the management of furnaces has
proved, though, that the difference in favor of the British
furnaces was more apparent than real; hence their pro-
bable relinquishment in the near future. Of course, to
the British Co. itself they are next to useless.
Another “Howell man” leaves the B.H. Pro-
prietary’s service—the general manager's secretary, who,
during his six years’ service, has had to do much of the
unpleasant work in trying limes.
Very appreciable quantities of mercury are
being found in the kaolin ore at Broken Hill.
During the last week in August Broken Hill
concentrating mills dealt with 5574 tons sulphides. The
plant now' being erected will allow of an increase of over
50 per cent, on this.
British B.H. reports weekly two or three
hundred tons of rich ore sent to Block 14 Co. ; most of
this is, however, ore that has been long stacked.
* • * •
Last week’s returns from the Junction concen-
trators were 588 tons sulphide treated for 140 tons first-
concentrates, the latter containing 42 pier cent, of
the silver and 55 of the lead in the crude ore. Some
more metal—how much unstated, but probably little-is
in second-grade concentrates and slimes. This is fair
work as concentrating goes at present—only about half
the silver and all of the zinc lost.
At some Broken Hill mines reporters are fur-
nished with the minutest particulars of the week's run at
the concentrators. At others they are told that the
machine has “ had a successful run,” that so many tons
ore were treated, and so many tons concentrates “ of fair
average grade” —or something of that sort —produced.
No use asking for fuller particulars. Hence the piebald
character of the published news of Broken Hill weekly
yields. The statistics of the field’s production official
included—are simply more or less accurate guesswork.
The Central smelters are not contributing much
to the mine’s profit. They will inevitably be closed when
the question of the mine’s sale is settled : the syndicate,
if it does buy, has its special sulphide process, while the
co., if the sale falls through, will erect concentrators.
Mt. Drysdale Proprietary is a min© that is
always tfoinff to strike the Drysdale rich formation, but

The “ Storer-Marsh ” process, now adopted as
one of the two methods of handling the Broken Hill aid-
Poores by the Australian Smelting Co. at Illawarra, is
a Sydney invention, one of the patentees, Dr. John
fatorer, still residiug in that city. The London board of
the co. has strong names upon it. One comes from the
great London firm of Mathieson and Co., of Rio Tinto
copper-mines celebrity. The Rio Tinto mines, by the
way, still employ some 11,000 workmen.

The Adelaide "Corner ” is now so crowded that
extra policemen have had to be put on to keep the
thoroughfare clear.
Melb. democrats seem beginning to stir
themselves, and with good results. A meeting to
protest agaihst sweating was convened in the
Town Hall the other evening, and the bebaubled
Mayor Snowden, who appears to have recently
declared that 4s. lid. a day was enough for a
man, horse and cart, had the icy gall to take the
chair. Then one .Fleming, “a welliknown agita-
tor,” arose and moved that, in view of his
published sentiments, Snowden was not a fit
person to preside, and the meeting hoorayed
enthusiastically, and carried the motion by a very
large majority. Then it was suggested that
Lormer, J.P., who has gained some temporary
notoriety by his tirade on the iniquities of the
nominee magistrate, should take the chair, but
both he and the Rev. Chas. Strong declined
on the ground that it would be discourteous to
Snowden—thereby showing that they cared much
less about protesting against sweating than about
wounding the finer feelings of an alleged apostle
of sweating. Neither Trenwith nor Deakin was
able to control the meeting, and eventually Snow-
den retired in disgust, and had the hall cleared by
police, in the true spirit of the bourgeois who can’t
thrust his cut-and-dried programme down people’s
throats. So the meeting walked out and held
itself in the open air, and bracketed Snowden and
sweating for the purpose of simultaneous com
d mu itiun.

N.S. Wales has 4362 honorary J’s.P.

the anvil of Democracy.
Sydney is a dropsical pumpkin growing on
a dungheap of shoddy. To continue this condition
is the Foreign-trade policy.
“To find a parallel for the Mount Rennie

days of Irish history.”—Dalley.
Charles Lilley’s health is good and his

The Reid policy is the policy of the cab-

The S.A. Govt, has instructed the Police
Commissioner to at once report to the Chief Secre-
tary the case of any State employe arrested or
summoned for drunkenness or any other offence.
Premier Turner and his team celebrate
their first anniversary of office this month. Their
hold on the Treasury benches is firmer than ever.
No Govt, of late years has given so much satisfac-
tion.
Woman-suffrage seems to stand a very fair
chance of early consideration by Vic. Assembly,
when one remembers that the handsome spouse
of Attorney-General Isaacs is one of its most
ardent advocates.
Teetotaller Wood, M.P., is trying to
abolish the S.A. Parliamentary refreshment-bar.
It is pretty sure, however, that Wood, who, as a
speaker, is a far greater calamity than the Accursed
Drink, will be abolished himself next year.
General Tulloch, late Victorian comman-
dant, in Fortnightly Review
The Government paid him (Speight) to go: the result
being that the annual loss to the railways now amounts
to half-a-million annually.
It wasn’t Speight’s retirement that caused the
deficit; it was the deficit that caused Speight’s
■retirement.
Rutledge, A.G.

M'Lellan, the

out of date since the passing of the Shiels Act.
The N.S.W. Labor-party needn’t be bull-

the Windeyer question. If Reid chooses to make

Both the Victorian and N.S.W. Land-tax
Bills contained a special tax on absentees, but
whereas the Vic. measure defined an absentee as
a person living outside Australia, the N.S.W.

Sydney Telegraph ; “As a matter of
principle we have no more right to saddle our-
selves with posterity’s burdens than to saddle

evidently afraid that the people are going to rush
in and pay off the public debt, and it wants
them to go slow.
Gen. Tulloch (late Vic. commandant) on
Victorian Protection :
Wages are so low that 300 workers specially petitioned
for assistance to emigrate. . . . Some trades give
high wages—at the expense of the rest of the colony. ~
Won’t either of them suit? Can no good come

Treasurer Holder (S.A.) squares his finan-
cial statement this year by the simple device of
omitting to pay the annual instalment of .£60,000

Amount shunted on to posterity, as usual. The
average Treasurer ought to be re-christened the
Minister for Leaving Things till To-morrow.
The defeat of the prominent Assembly
debaters, at last N.S.W. election, has taken much
importance from the Lower House and transferred
it to the Upper, where recent debates have been
exceptionally strong. There are certainly no men
in the Lower House now of equal calibre with a
few in the Upper—such as R. E. O’Connor, Salo-
mons, M'Lanrin and Pilcher. This undue debat-
ing prominence of the Upper House and the
diminution of debating interest in the Assembly
have a tendency to place the statue where the
pedestal should be. Premier Reid has pulled
down the towering pillars of the Lower House
debate, such as Parkes and Wise, and left thereof
supported by nothing stronger than wind.
A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE.
Smoking carriage between Hay and Junee, N.S. W. Occupants: Tracy Backein
(bookmaker, late commercial-traveller), Harry Bagwell (commercial-
traveller), and elderly gentleman who snores.
HARRY BAGWELL ( suddenly interrupting the elderly gentleman) : “ How is it
you don't put up at Elvy’s now, Tracy?”
TRACEY BACKEIN ( indifferently, without looking up from his paper): “ Charge
too much, Harry.”
HARRY: “ I saw you having a barney with Elvy over your bill. What did
you do, Tracy? ”
TRACY: “ What could I do! Paid it.”
HARRY : “ No, but what took place ?”
TRACY ( impatiently): “What could take place? Elvy brought his bill. I
said, ‘That's wrong, Mr. Elvy—charge too much.' He said, ‘Too
much, Mr. Backein? There's wine, 7s. 6d., stout' - ‘ Don't
want to know what I've had to drink, thank you, Mr. Elvy.’ ‘ Well,
then there's washing, 3s. 6d.’ 'Yes,' I said, 'cheap, well-done. But
that’s not it, it's the total.’ ‘ Well, but so many days at 10s. a day
makes' - ‘THAT’s what's the matter,' I said. 'You always used
to charge me 8s. a day.’ 'Ah,’ he said, ‘but THEN you were a
‘ traveller,' now you're a gentleman, Mr. Backein.’ ‘Oh,’ I said,
‘it's going to cost me 14s. a week to be a gentleman.’ ”
HARRY: “ But I say, Tracy ”
TRACY : “ What, Harry?”
HARRY: “ Can't a 'traveller’ be a gentleman, Tracy?”
TRACY: “ They say not, Harry."
HARRY: “ No, but hang it ! what's the difference?”
TRACY: “ Two shillings, Harry."— (Retires into his newspaper for the rest of

In the face of the recent disgraceful out-
rages at Maokay, Tozer had the cool cheek to say
the other day in Parliament that the only dis-
turbed district known to him was Flinders, where
the troubles were entirely of white origin. Tozer
has long ago recognised the value of the axiom :
“Truth is our most priceless possession; let us
economise it.”
“Johnny” Isaacs delights to assert hisforce
of character by voting agin brother Isaac Isaacs in
the Vic. Tariff divisions. But when the life of I.
Isaacs’ party hangs upon a vote or two, J. Isaacs
will get a stern command to follow the relative
who practically put him in his seat. No insubor-
dination is permitted in times of battle, murder,
or sudden death.
Yic. pietists are agitating with renewed
vigor for Bible lessons in State schools. “Children
in Victoria know much too little of the Word of
God,” says the spokesman of a recent reverend
deputation. The Minister did not make the
obvious reply that it was possible for them to
know a Lot too much. But sarcasm is absolutely
wasted on the clergy.
A young man in Melbourne answered an
advt. which appeared the other day, and which
was an offer to impart, in return for the modest
sura of 6d., reliable information as to a certain
and easy means of ranking a fortune without
capital to start upon. The information : “ Take
full charge and control of the Unemployed Move-
ment for the coming season.”
Could you possibly have a more thorough
demonstration of the futility of Chamber-
lain’s policy than the movement to exclude
Hindoos from Victoria? For, mind, Ghollah and
Chunder are our glorious and well-beloved fellow-
subjects of Her Cracious Majesty ; not aliens like
Hung Fat and Ski Hi. And here is J. Cham-
berlain stitching up Greater Britain into one
quilt.
Piddington, M.P. (N.S. W ) for Tam worth,
was a lecturer at Sydney University, and jiis
debating efforts, though promising, are given with
a strong Austrylian accent and in the moat
approved pedagogic style. He quotes, he refers,
he adverts, he reads extracts, he gives everybody’s
opinion but Piddington’s; meanwhile, he flour-
ishes a lead-pencil aloft in a most threatening
manner.
Kingsbury, M.L.A. (Q.), defines a vigor-
ous public works policy thus : “ A vigorous public
works policy means—borrow, bribe, boom, and
burst. It means corruption throughout the
length and breadth of Queensland, and political
railways that have not yet earned the cost of
maintenance.” Kingsbury ought to know : the
party of which he is a member pursued that policy
as long as it possibly could.
The little band of Yic. Freetrade members
fought desperately against every protective duty
on the alleged ground that it “raised prices to the
consumer.” But when the tea-duty, which isn’t
protective, came up they gave an almost solid vote
for its retention for the sake of revenue, and des-
pite the fact that it does, or ought to, raise price*
to the consumer. The Vic. Freetrade membe)
only worries about the consumer when he finds i
duty helping along a local industry and furnishing
employment. When it does none of these things,
the consumer can have prices raised upon him til
the Day of Judgment.

The £475 exemption in the N.S.W. Lane
tax Bill was re-afflrmed by 76 votes to 14. Th*
76 were a motley crowd consisting of men win
believed in the exemption, men who said the.'
didn’t believe in it but that they thought th*
country wanted it, and men who said frankly thav
they voted for it because they hoped and believer
it would damn the measure in the Council
Meanwhile the two Houses are in a curious post
tion. The President of the Council has decider
that the measure is a taxation bill, and can’t b*
amended in the Upper House ; the Speaker of tin
Assembly has decided that it is not a taxation
but only an assessment bill, and can be amendec
by the “ fossils.” And as the fossils badly warn
to alter it they will probably take Speake
Abbott’s ruling as decisive, and strike the exem;
tions out bodily. Then—Deadlock and Chaos.
The result of the Dean Commission provec
that theN.S. W. Crown Law authorities nearly sue
ceeded in hanging an innocent man, yet not onb
has Dean received no compensation for the greai
wrong done him, but the Government declines t*
defray the cost of conducting his case before th.
Commission. The Treasury cheerfully paid th*
needful expenses to have Dean wrongfully con
victed, and when it became almost certain that
his sentence was wholly unjust, it cheerfully spem
a colossal sum in trying to maintain the wrongfu
conviction. But the idea of refunding to Dean oi
his friends the money which they were driven tt
expend by reason of the “ Crown’s” hideous blur
dering is quite foreign to the spirit of Botany Baj
“justice.” Dean’s lawyers remain almost wholh
unpaid—as a warning to other lawyers not to inter
fere the next time an innocent man is convicted
and thus become a nuisance to influential pe)
sonages.
See how these lawyers love one another
See how Premier Reid wriggles over fixing a daj
for the discussion of Price, M.P.’s motion declar
ing Justice Windeyer unfit for the Bench ! Tht
Premier’s' technical argument that the
“ can only be removed on address to the Qneeii
surely amounts to nothing, for, as a justice of th*
Supreme Court, Mr. Windeyer must be regardet
. as a man too self-respecting and patriotic to rt
main on the Bench one instant after he had bee*
censured by the elective branch of the Legislature,
The Premier’s reply must be construed as ai*
insult to Judge Windeyer, implying, as it doe*
that his Honor wouldn’t shift unless actuallj
dragged off the bench. The Bulletin trusts tt
see his Honor resent that insult by insisting ot
the instant discussion, or withdrawal, of th«
motion. The action of Premier Reid in the matte)

tioner.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Moiled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture. all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, no tli 1 1 ie w a beautiful complexion of
peach an- 1 v t' e had by anyone who makes
a eontrnnie. T ncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

The late Mr. AUGUSTUS MORRIS, one of
the last surviving members of N.S. Wales
“Mixed Parliament.”
A certain re - elected Victorian Leg.
Councillors can barely write his own name, and
can’t read at all. However, he’s good enough for
the Leg. Council.
Saturday Review, reviewing H. Parkes’ B
senile sonnets: “Let us be thankful that Aus-

The oldest aboriginal of Narandera
(N.S.W.) district, Jack Mack, died recently, aged
DO years. He was a total abstainer—the only nig.

of.
A poet called the other day at the office of
an eminent Melb. solicitor supposed to be a
patron of Australian literature. To the huge
delight of the clerks, the first thing the poet did
after introducing himself was to put his hand in
his overcoat pooket, pull out a sock and com-
posedly wipe his rubicund proboscis therewith.
A personal illustration of the poetic foot.
Diana Baxter, last of
the Tooram tribe of blacks,
has died, aged 65, at Warr-
nambool. When Gov. Hope-
toun first visited Warrnam-
bool, Diana wandered in
while luncheon was on,
slapped H.E. on the back,
and remarked, “My boy,
here tiokpen for you.” The
Governor took it and gave
i hi- lady a sovereign in ex-
change, whereon she ex-
claimed, “God bless you, my
boy. ”
Salmon Wilson’s will
directed that all the furni-
ture, china, and pictures at his London house
should be sold, “ excepting the family portraits.”
Evidently the lineal descendant of Alfred the
Great had obtained an assortment of ancestral
“old masters ” from the Wardour-street dealers.
Strange to say. he didn’t purchase a family grave
in advance. “The testator bequeathed .£l5OO for
the erection of a vault and monument at such
cemetery or burial-ground as the executors may
think fit.”
Rev. F. Barclay, of Collingwood, Vic., is
a parson who has done some service to Demos
In England, some few years back, he was presi-
dent and active organiser of the successful London
busmen’s strike.
Again the clerical humorist! Rev. Phillips,
who escaped the Ku-Cheng slaughter, speaking of
those who didn’t: —“The great misfortune was
that only two of them were dressed ! ” “ Take
my life—but spare my collah !”
While Gov. Brassey’s son got a severe
drubbing at the British elections his brother,
Albert, managed to squeeze in for the first time.
He is the antithesis of his titled relative, being a
cast-iron Tory and an army man.
Dr. Alfred Austin Brown, just appointed
Vic. Govt, meat-expert, is a M.B. and M.Ch. of
Melb. He did all his medical work while earning
his bread as an official of Melb. G.P.O. ; in order
to attend lectures and hospital work in the day-
time, he always worked on the night-shift. A
man of such grit should be a square peg in a
square hole.
Amongst recent deaths reported from
England is that of Lady Lisgar, widow of Gov.
Young, of N.S. Wales (1861-’67). After the death
of Sir John Young, she married Sir Francis Tur-
ville, that Governor’s private secretary, who also
predeceased her.
Parkes lately told an interviewer that
once when very hard-up he discovered four £lO
notes between the leaves of a book in his library.
“But now,” said he, waving his hand towards the
shelves, “you would search long before you would
find £4O in them.”
The Potiphar case of the Melb. Law Courts
is burnt into the memory of middle-aged lawyers.
A ladies’ doctor was unsuccessfully sued for alleged
assault on the beautiful wife of an Anglican
clergyman. The action would never have been
brought but for his sneer—“ Potiphar’s wife.”
J. L. Purves will shortly repeat before the
Bar the sulphurous and variegated lecture which
he recently gave before the law students. Thus
Alma Mater —“The lecture took three hours to
deliver, yet there was not a single moment at
which the audience was bored.” What an appe-
tite for brimstone!
Police-Inspector Duffy, a veteran N.S.W.
officer, who emigrated to Victoria in the early
fifties, and was on duty at the Eureka Stockade
on the morning the rebellion broke out, has died
at Maitland. He it was who tracked down and
shot the murderer of Senior-Sergeant Wallings,
beyond Dubbo, in 1878.
A Sydney clergyman, high up in the
L.O.L’s., lately addressed a public meeting having
for its object the changing of the name of the suburb
of St, Peter’s. A Imost as amusing as the case of the
determined anti-R.G. who once declined to post
his English correspondence because it would be
carried by the s.s. Rome.
Coming men, like events, cast their
shadows before. The barque Mark Twain, from
Buenos Ayres to Melbourne, put in to Portland,
Vic., last week. She was much disabled through
the weather she had encountered. And that is
what is the matter with Mark Twain himself, who
comes to Australia with a very slim purse.
David Syme narrowly escaped becoming a
great explorer. Immediately after his arrival in
Victoria he advertised that he desired to join
some other person with a little money in making
a trip across the continent from Melbourne to
where Port Darwin now stands. He would long
have ante-dated the futile attempt of Burke and
Wills.
Judge Harding (Q.) died a disappointed
man. Sixteen years on the bench and the author
of erudite text-books, he hoped to be Chief-Jus-
tice, but saw the honor snatched by a needy poli-
tician. His irascible temper improved with age,
and his later life was free from such incidents as
his scenes with one Swanwick, whom he once sen-
tenced to 40 years for contempt. Score this to his
credit —he fought strongly throughout for the
better defence of prisoners.
Augustus Morris, ex-official-assignee, and
one of six remaining members of the N.S.W.
mixed Parliament of 1851-1856, died at Manly on
Aug. 29, aged 76. Few people thought him so
old. He was born in Van Diemen’s Land during
the reign of Col. Sorell (1820), and had all his life
been a well-respected and energetic citizen. But
five members of the Parliament in question now
remain —Henry Parkes, pensioner Merewether (a
nominee), Daniel Cooper, Charles Nicholson and
Saul Samuel, the latter four all resident in Eng-
land. At one time Mr. Morris was a very
wealthy pastoralist and most popular employer,
but he lost his all in the great pastoral crash and
had to seek an official aupointment in his old age.
His wife died a few weeks ago, and her demise
greatly affected the deceased. Mr. Morris was, in
many respects, an able man, and his memory
will be kept green as that of a cultured and
benevolent citizen of unimpeachable honor.
THE BUR-R-R-RD.
“ The amu,” said Paddy O’Sullivan, of the
River, is “ the foinest thing to keep a yard clean.
He tackles ould boots, bottles, tins, or fencing-
wire. The big fellow up here cleared off with
me frying-pan. It took him three days to digest,
but he’s back again and has got his eye on me
billy.”
Melb. demise : Processional-auctioneer
Knipe, an esteemed citizen, with an ineradicable
skein of harmless quackery. Contested numerous
elections, apparently on the principle of how not
to do it. Built Knipe’s Folly, a wonderful castel-
lated place, on the hill, Bendigo.
When Purves, Q.C., pleads before Chief
Justice Acting-Gov. Madden, people will be
always apt to remember that the Ciiief Justice is
more or less related to Surgeon O’Hara, and that
Madden’s brother-in-law, Frank Stephen, had a
row with Purves re the defeat of O’Hara (the
Madden family candidate) at a Melb, Hospital
election.
Melb. Paunch paints Reeves, the Maori-
land Minister, as one of a “narrow-minded and
uneducated set of legislators and as one who
through some extraordinary freak holds the
position of Minister of Education.” This non-
sense owes its birth to the Argus, which
ought to know better. As a fact, Reeves is a
University man, and a journalist of very high
capacity.
0. E. Jones blooms again in Melb., trying
to take the wind out of the canvas of Loisette.
Jones on memory! This a queer world ! “ThePas-
schal Lamb is ready for the sacrifice, but the mint
sauce is wanting, is the historical saying attri-
buted to Jones, and denied by him in the era
when it seemed doubtful whether C. E. Jones
was to become Graham Berry, or Graham Berry
C. E. Jones.

Nineteenth Century, about which a Bulletin
correspondent was asking a question a fortnight

ago, is said .to be that H.H.C. was formerly more
or less engaged to James Knowles’s daughter. He
was then “sub.-ing” the blue-covered review.
Daughter and editorship would doubtless have
gone together; but, as the wedding didn’t come
off, the editorship didn’t either.
Solomon, M.P., blushed violently when
he rose in S. A. Assembly to take charge of “ The
Synagogue Bill.” He is the only avowed Jew in
the local Parliament, though dear old Scherk,
M.P., is believed to be of the Chosen.
Mr. C. Thackeray, promoter of the N.S.
Wales Fishermen’s Association, has been ap-
pointed superintendent of the Sydney Boys’
Brigade. It will be Mr. Thackeray’s constant
endeavor to teach the boys to speak ihe truth.
While the Fitchetts, Blanksbys, Garrards
and Curnows declared the other day that the
strongest of Australia’s religious efforts should be
in the direction of uniting the scattered faiths of
Methodism, Chief Justices Way and Darley ad-
vocated a union by all Protestant Churches, with
a notification that the R.C. Church must be com-
pelled to stand alone on the other side. In asso-
ciation with these it is well to recall that another
Chief Justice —Higmbotham—invoked Metho-
ists, Protestants of every description, and Romans
to come out of ecclesiastical Christianity and
unite in Deism.
A pitiful story re the last moments of
“ Salmon ” Wilson is going the rounds. The Earl
of Huntingdon married a daughter of the gilded
squatter, and after the wedding Wilson found that
there was a claimant of the Huntingdon earldom
—who, however, did not wish to contest a money-
less title —a “homeless coronet.” The discovery
that his daughter’s husband might not be the
“ Real Mackay ” chiefly caused the rich man’s
fatal illness. On his death-bed he sent for the
alleged claimant and asked him to promise that
he would do nothing to disturb the “man in
possession.” The promise was readily given, but
the claimant’s heirs may yet be heard from.
Had B. M. Clark pushed his Bradley’s
Head adjournment motion, in N.S.W. Assembly,
to a successful vote, Reid might possibly have re-
signed, as Parkes did in a similar case. Then would
have ensued as acrimonious and fratricidal a fight
for power as Australian politics have witnessed.
On going to the country, Parkes, Barton,
M'Millan, Bruce Smith, Dibbs, Wise, R. E.
O’Connor, Jacob, Crick, John Davies, and B. W.
O’Sullivan, with congenial sutlers, would fly one
flag, and M'Gowan, Brunker, Sleath, Reid, Pid-
dington, Angus Cameron, Want, and Garran,
also with congenial sutlers, the other. It didn’t
come to pass, for Clarke didn’t push a vote, out
Time has the occasion in store.
Melb. hasa Leg. Council election again after
many years. J. M. Davies —lawyer, pietist, land-
boomer, anti-gambler, social puritan, brother of
Matthew, &o. —opposed by lawyer Godfrey, whose
redeeming feature is advocacy of minimum-wage.
The Sargoods, Services, &c., are working hard for
Davies, whose seat is plainly in danger. Godfrey
is a sorb of Ishmaelite in all societies and might
make things lively in the sleepy Chamber.
The policy of the N.S.W. Justice Depart-
ment is to “ review ” in secret the Mount Rennie
case and quietly release the surviving prisoners—
thus getting rid of the agitation. The prisoners
must be released—the Department knows that.
So, to spare the Judge’s feelings, it proposes to
go through the farce of allowing one of its
luminous worms to crawl in the darkness across
the graves of the hanged, and label the journey an
“enquiry.”
According to the Queensland Sugar Works
Guarantee Act, Government may only guar-
antee debentures issued under a Central Mill sys-
tem. Q. Govt, has had the audacity to spend
public money in taking up the debentures of the
Marian Central Mill, an illegal proceeding- to
which the Auditor-General promptly drew atten-
tion. However, Attorney-General Byrnes had a
little retrospective amnesty-bill drawn out, and
things will soon be all right again.
Richie, the curves-and-
angles artist, is a Tasmanian,
and entirely self-taught. He
has now an engagement on a
noted Parisian illustrated
paper.
The higher emotions get
little play in the detective
force. An individual charged
with conspiracy to defraud is
a cousin of the detective in
charge of the case, who has
for some time been using every
endeavor to get his loving
relative gaoled. Asticklerfor
duty is that “ D.”
It is related of million-
aire Tyson that a station-
manager once tried to take
solid advantage of the long
man’s misogyny. He sold
Mr. Tyson a large number of
sheep, the buyer reserving the
right to cull. The manager,
fearing that the millionaire
would get the best of the bar-
gain, invited several ladies to
be present. This was too much
for Tyson, who jumped on his
horse and left his overseer to
do the culling.
When the Earl of Yar-
mouth was visiting the Hope-
touns in the Vic. western dis-
trict, the giddy young thing
one day astonished the local
coachdriver by springing on to
the back of one of the leaders
while the coach (loaded with
passengers) was travelling
rapidly; the horse also ex-
pressed surprise, and soon
landed the flighty youth on
the roadside, where he fell
heavily on his head, and
emitted a fervent “ Oh, h— ! ”
“Yes, that’s the place you’ll
be goin’ to one of these davs,
my boy,” said the driver.
Higgins, member for Geelong (Vic.) wants
the tea duty abolished. “I ask nothing that
could in any way embarrass Ministers,” said
Higgins. “But they may easily consent to remit
the tea duty. It will not cost more than .£lOO,OOO
a year.” Then Minister Best, to whom £5 of
Customs revenue is a matter of life or death now,
tried to get up and reply, But his legs gave way
under him, and he fell back into his seat.
That Freetrade is synonymous with cheap-
ness is again demonstra'ed in Melbourne. This
time in the case of cream-separators. One machine
which costs less than .£lB abroad and is duty-free
is sold in Melbourne by philanthropic importers
for <£4o. Other importers’ monopolies, like sew-
ing-machines and bicycles, are also about 150 per
cent, above ’Ome prices; but the Arous points
triumphantly to tea as a proof that importers do
not combine to bleed the people.
It is an open secret that W. M‘Millan,
M.P., is not likely to prove an ardent supporter
of the present N.S.W. Govt. He is a close friend
of Bruce Smith and B. R. Wise, and thinks the
latter has been treated very shabbily by Premier
RGd. He is also averse to the proposed Upper
House reform, and is indignant at the scant
courtesy shown to Railway Commissioner Eddy
in regard to his promised increase of salary. By
the way, M’Millan and Eddy went to, and re-
turned from England together.
“ As our Tariff Board has in effect re-
ported, there is no bigger revenue robbery than
this of the Victorian tobacco and cigar factories
in existence the wide world over.” — Me/b. Argus.
Here we have an assumption that the revenue is
robbed because it doesn’t collect a certain amount
of tax which has not been imposed :
Of all Freetraders terms, wherewith
The Argus and its Murray Smiih
Are striving lo kick up a i ohhery,
The most delusive form of speech,
Pertaining to the creed ihe,\ preach.
Is that new-fangled “ Revenue Robbery.”
“ Are you going to vote by your fore-
man?” was the contemptuous question put by a
British peer on a memorable accession to the
newly-appointed members of his order. Queen
Anne had created 12 new peers with the object
of getting a particular Bill through the Lords, and
on the measures coming to a vote the ancient
fogies taunted the devoted 12 to the brink of
desperation. Reid’s 10 plus two are about in the
same fix in N.S.W. Legislative Council, and the
historical parallel is in many respects complete.
In taunts, at all events, the Council fogies will
hold their end up.

RESTORED TO HEALTH
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. Cnmm in", of Yarraville,
Victoria, Australia, says:
“About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life. Ob-
taining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to me,
I filially tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and from
that time, I began to gain health and strength.
I continued the treatment until fully recov-
ered, and now have very great pleasure in
telling my friends of the merits of Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla, and the happy results of its use. I
consider it the best blood-purifier known.”

"It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Bengers food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he aide to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ' I’enger’s
Food.' From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength."
"If every mother knew of
its value no Other would be

Dear Bulletin, —I met in Melb., the
other day, a Coolgardie miner—a grizzled, old
fellow with a face burnt to the hue of a fire-brick
and huge, hairy hands. I wanted him to tell me
about some of his experiences—which I had heard
were uncommonly eurious—in Westralia, but he
preferred to read me some of his poems in MS.
They were all about girls with golden hair, and
eyes so blue, and lips so sweet, and hearts so true,
and similar callow sentimentalities. It was very
funny, but I dared not laugh—the man was so
intensely in earnest. Seeing that he seemed to
be interested in that sort of thing, I asked him
what he thought of certain pieces of verse by
Lawson and others, published in The Bulletin—
which he said he took regularly. His reply
astounded me. Folding up his MSS. and replac-
ing them in his pocket, he remarked slowly, “ I
know nothing about ’em. I never read anything
in The Bulletin but the‘Wild Cat’column.”—
Crekve Roe.
For coughs, colds you can’t beat Colemane
and Sons Eucalypte Extract.*
Dear Bulletin,— .Re your par. as to
Premier Turner’s billycock. The Opposition
might subscribe to buy him a new one, as sug-
gested, but they could not find enough amongst
them to induce him to wear it. That hat and the
ancient brown ulster (both used constantly for
years) not only reconcile him to the democratic
section of St. Kilda electorate, ns “ one of them-
selves,” but create a distinct individuality for
their wearer—and the cute Premier knows it! He
is one of the very few men in Melbourne who
appreciate the value of eccentricity in dress
(especially headgear). Many Melbourne men’s
prominence is largely due to their hats. Look,
for instance, at Broken Hill Knox’s broad-
brimmed semi-conical billycock! No self-
respecting tramp would accept it as a gift.
Yet, every street-boy in the cir.y knows
that magnate as “ ’im with the ’at!” (Mr. Knox’s
shape is patented for his sole use). The form of
Judge Moles worth’s cady is even more daring and
original than his recent utterances. Dr. Strong’s
reverend topper is sired by a bishop’s, the dam
being a quaker’s broad-brim. “ Auster ” Sharp,
the boss Vic. timber-merchant, sports a buff
“ blood-basin ” 3£in. in height with a brim 18in.
wide (absolutely unique). Every Melb. man
knows Hugh Peck’s squat, curly-brimmed half-
belltopper hat, although no one knows that Hugh
has ever done anything to bring himse f into
particular prominence. What Southerner cannot
recall C. B. Fisher’s eccentric grey billy-cock, or
fail to recognise it as sole-surviving brother to
starter Watson’s ? Ex Postmaster-General Der-
ham’s hat is undoubtedly bred from Knox’s,
although it is not nearly so upstanding as its sire;
nevertheless, Mr. Derham’s “roof’’does more to
popularise his biscuits than any number of advts.
Every man, indeed, can recall ancient memories
of others who would be utterly forgotten but for
the quaintness of their head-gear. It’s said that
no businessman except a millionaire can afford to
wear a shabby or out-of-date hat in London ; but,
if a man wants to get known in Melbourne, he
should consistently wear an original shape— say, a
rough beaver or a Welsh sugar-loaf, for instance.
That man is sure to get. on. “By his hat shall ye
know him.”— Arthur Robinson.
When Charles Dickens edited the Daily
News, the proofs were fetched in to him by a
livened footman, on a salver !

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Within the past 13 years the Melbourne Cup
has been won eight times by horses handicapped at from
7»t. lllb. to Bst. 51b.—a martin of 81b. only. There were
two winners each at 7st. 1311)., Bst. 31b., and Bst. 41b. ; one
at 7st. llln., and one »t Bst. 51b. Tills year there is
nothing at Bst. Sib. or 7«i. 1111)., but the Bst. 51l>. and 7st.
131 b. horses include Bruin, Ascot Vale, Aureus, Dream-
land, Brilliant, Laundress, Sainfoin, Bradfoid, Nuda, The
Trier, Hortensius, and Royal Master.
• • • •
Not one of the last four Melb. Cup winners has
put a race to bis credit since taking the big pool. Only
°!l!i (Patron) is entered again this year, and the
odds against Patron’s dicky foreleg coining to the post
are fully 5 to 1.
r • * • •
The Tasmanian “knowing ones’’ swear that
Music will make them dance to an unexpected tune in the
Melb. Cup. Music is one of the original eight-stoners,
along with Newman, Nobleman, Taranaki, Burton, and
Alpine. The Tasmanian tips, however, are seldom worth
much at Flemington.
• ♦ ♦ ♦
W. R. Wilson expects that every ticket in the
St. Alban’s “Distribution” will be sold by the date of
drawing-Oct. 24. It seems possible that the eleventh-
hour applicants will find themselves shut out, judging
from George Adams’ experiences with ids money sweeps.
Every holder of one or more shares in the St.
Alhan’s lottery wishes Wilson a splendid run of luck at
the finish. When you have made up j our mind to win
four horses in training, as well as the*estate, with a £5
investment, you naturally' want those animals to come
into your possession covered with glory. If any of Wil-
son’s distinguish themselves at Randwick a whole mob of
sanguine owners-to-be will feel that their properly has
improved in value.

A Melb. parson last week remarked that
Gambling in aid of a church is very different from
gambling on the racecourse.” The Bulletin s colonial
oath ! One could never get 30 members at a shilling to
go for a i,T-note on the course, and then offer the winner
a kiss to be allowed to raffle it again.
♦ * * •
A Melb. bookie’s yarn. “Last year, when I
was betting on the two Cups, I left my blue pencil at
home one day, and bought a black one. I only laid one
double that afternoon, and it was Paris and Patron. This
year I wouldn’t write a ticket in black for a fiver."
• • ♦ •
In South Australia betting on racecourses is
illegal, but the man who lays lotalisator odds can’t be in-
terfered with because the courts have declared that he is
only betting on commission, and that betting on commis-
sion isn’t betting. The courts don’t profess to decide
what it is ; they merely decide what it isn’t, so the law is
in a state of temporary paralysis. It would simplify things
a lot if the bench, when it decides that something isn’t
the tiling it seems to be, were required at the same time
to explain what thing it really is, so that the law will have
a chance of knowing where he are, in a manner of speak-
ing. It seems safe to assume that every thing is some-
tiling’, so this request isn’t unreasonable. Moreover, it
would be interesting to know why betting on commission
isn t betting. The judges ought to know.

A novel but feasible system of preventing the
nnging-in of Australian trotters in Maoriland is sug-
gested by a Wellington sport, who lias got tired of inves-
tigating piotests T 6 strange-looking prads usually
bought for a couple of quid from a Maori.” His idea is
to brand maiden trotters by' tatooing the gums of the
teeth, a registered code of marts making identification
clear. Tampering with the brands would render the
horse liable to be laid aside for life. A unique proposal
with little pain to the horse. r ’

The comely Sheet Anchor horse, Duhallow,
winner of a Vic. suburban race last week, will now likelv
be the Davis stable selection for Caulfield Cup in prefer-
ence to Damper, who has lately failed publicly ’ when the
cash was up.
* * * *
Last year a Q. man worker! “ the race-game ”
(toy horses going round-tbe winner takes the pool) on
the racecourse, and got “ run in,” machine and all. Next
day be pleaded that the same game was play ed in aid of
the churches, &c.—lint Hie J’s.P. indignantly sentenced
linn and confiscated bis machine. At, the Govt, auction a
chinch member bought that machine, cheap, and now
works it (at least, bis pretty daughter does) all round the
different church bazaars, with great success to the church
and himself.

As the hard-going at Randwick has prevented
many trainers from sending their nags along, many
animals will strip at this meeting not thoroughly wound
up. Still good sport should be seen, as contingents
from M.L., Vic., and Queensland have arrived to measure
strides with the N.S.W. cracks.
In the Spring Stakes (l|m.) the meeting of St.
Hippo, Allas, Delaware, Newman, and Portsea or Patron
at w.f.a, should prove exciting. The M.L. horse should
he capable of overcoming all opposition, though the best
of the Victorians may give him trouble. Delaware wants
more time, and will he seen to better advantage in Melb.
Cup. The Craven Plate should also fall to Bt. Hippo if
he can beat Georgie.
In the Epsom Handicap most of the candidates
carry their owners’ coin and confidence. Nobleman has
been sharpened up considerably of late, and is now in
fair condition, so this unlucky horse has a good chance of
capturing a rich prize. Euroka and Alcmeiia may turn
out his most dangerous opponents. The flying Georgie
must run well, hut she is virtually handicapped at 51h.
over w.f.a., whilst Nobleman has a drop of 7lh. ; so, on
their All-age Stakes running at R.mdwick Autumn Meet-
ing, Nobleman would appear to have a bit the hestcf it.
In very slow time Sol an urn won the County
Purse at the recent Hawkeshury Club Meeting, and, even
with the 7H). penalty which that victory entails, he is a
prominent favorite for Epsom Handicap ; hut, being far
from ripe, a fast-run mile may not he to his liking. Fit
and well at Caulfield Cup-time, he should be near winning.
The English handicapper has dealt rather con-
temptuously with the great little Pans, the Julian Salo-
mons of the turf, who has been let off with Bst in the
Ceesarewitch (2m. 2fur. 35yds.), and 7st. 101 b. in the Cam-
bridgeshire (Im. 240yds.). The American coit Foxall, as a
three-year-old, won the double carrying 7st. 121 b and
9st. respectively, whilst the French fillv Plaisanterie also
a three-year-old, pulled off the two events carrying 7sl.
81h. and Bst. 121 b. If Paris is all right and is worth his
passage-money he should go and do likewise.
Now his luck has turned for the better, Mr S
Hordern should win the Trial Slakes on Saturday with one
of his powerful string, though the bochiel colt, Loch Leigh
may he expected to run well. Tills colt should manage
to win a good race shortly.
Little Oxide has undergone a good preparation
for the Metrop., and may here recompense Mr. Walter
Hall for all his previous disappointments. It is bruited
that Mahee will he in commission for this race : if so he
will at least nearly win.
Bob Ray and Mannlicher are the great public
fancies for the Derby', whilst of the Vic, representatives
Onward seems to gain most friends. But, these three
horses may find worthy opponents in Ooolalta Vbiai
and Blue Cap, one of which three most likely will win the
Blue Ribbon.
Mr. S. Hordern has a smart little nag in the
English-bred Hindoo(Rightnway— Idolatry). Thisshanelv
j.laeu col, is,-ported as being-able to gße a reason ihle
amount of weight away, over a mile, to the recent
winner, Toreador. If ibis is so, the “ bla k man” should
run forward in the Epsom, where he carries but 6st. 101 b
As a Hire-year-old, last Birthday meeting, hewonth.
Amateur Weller (7fnr.), carrying 9st. 91 h. in Imin. 83seoe
Another English-bn d colt, Mostyn (Claii vaux—Miss.
Mogtyn), a former winner in S.A., lias arrived at Hand-
wick, dis also expected to run well in the Epsom, where
he carries Bst. 101 b.
“Dick’’ Mason, Mannlicher’s mentor, is san-
guine of the colt s victory in A.J.O. Derby, asserting that
the majority of the candidates area poor, nnadvanced lot.
Mr. Q. G. Stead lias come across to see the Maxim young-
ster perform, and hopes to pick up a minor race with
Mauser or Musketry. The Mannlichcr people expect the
game Ahercorn youngster, Vivian, to be sandwiched
between the M.L. horse and Boh Hay in the home run.
In the Maori landers’ opinion, Fitz Donovan, the English-
bred horse, will make a big show in ttie Epsom, and an
outsider whom they expect to run well up is Milkmaid,
kept specially for the meeting.

The Melb. Bicycle Club’s Austral meeting,
next Nov., will be a big event, with its Austral Wheel
Race first prize of £2OO, and second of £4O. Zimmer-
man will be there, and Iwo or three dark horses who
know as much about the science of training and racing as
Zimmerman does. And that is saying everything.
Privately cabled that Zimmerman has sailed for
Australia in the Oruba ; he will, therefore, arrive in time
to witness the early October meeting in Adelaide. Zim.
wdl Probably race first in Sydney. His mile (paced by a
quad.’ ), in Imin. 57 4-sth sec., shows his recent grand
form ; natheless, many cyclists sav he will meet his man
in Megson, and Megson himself, perhaps the last athlete
to blow, claims to have ridden a mile, at Adelaide, under
2nnn. Time records are imperfect guides, hut in the
present cases they should indicate at least some sort of a
struggle between Zim. and Megson, each having proved
that he can race both against time and men.

The bicycling craze in Melbourne has a lotto do
with the depression in the tramway receipts. Recently
the tramway co. decided to investigate the matter, and
stationed a man at Princes Bridge to count the cvolists
coming mto business on the spidery wheel. Between 8
and 9.30 a.m. he reckoned SSO sprinting in from the
Southern suburbs alone. This probably represented
some 400 threepences, or £5 in hard cash, lost to the
tramways, for the Melbournian is not a walking animal
by nature—at least the appearance of his legs doesn’t
suggest it. °

A generous sportsman is Parsons, the Yic.
cyclist, who pulled up towards the very close of the
Victorian 00-tmle road cycle race, last Saturday, in order
to allow the second man, the fallen Carpenter, to remount
and get level before racing in. Fifty yards from home,
however. Carpenter fell again, over a dog, and Parsons

that the racing methods there are quite different to ours
Sprinting is practised as a fine art, and the real racing is
done in the last two laps, the earlier part of the race living
a mere crawl. Zimmerman is great at this game, but he
may hit a snag if he carries it too far, as some of our
stayers make speed from the start.

Dear Bulletin,—Zimmerman may be “a won-
dious flyer” in ’Murka and Hingland, where traok-
bmlding is an art, but can he on our grass and oinder-
tr,i.;ks do such wondrous deeds—particularly when pitted
against men accustomed to this heavier riding ? The best
cinder-track in Melb. (the Exhibition) is as a ploughed
field to the smooth and scientifically-sloped path at Herne
Hill. Our heavy tracks may lake some of the gilt off Mr

There was a varied programme at Sydney
Cricket Ground last Saturday. Some Y.M.C.A. persons
clad in spotless white, gave a mediocre gymnastic display
—only remarkable as dispelling the general illusion that
no saint is ever muscular. Among other things they
swung clubs lo music, squatted tailor-fashion upon the
grass, tied themselves in ugly knots, and sat straddle-
legs across parallel bars to be photo'd. The lily-white
cycle amateurs, who are above racing for cash generally
showed that they were also above racing for honor aiid
the one feature of an otherwise funereal display was the
brilliant riding of Macdonald. Paced by a tandem hi the
Five-miles Championship of N.S.W., he gradually saw all
hut three of his competitors give up, and for the last six
laps he raced alone against the previous time record
vvli'le second and third men struggled hopelessly behind'
At the finish he gave the previous record a last grand
spurt and won in 12min. 57 4-ssec. ; the best five-mile
cycle time yet done on Sydney track.

ALCOHOLISM.
rpHIS terrible disease of drink, contracted throne I
i excessive sociability, deprives the best of mm
of all respect and reason ; it leads them to acts ol
indecency and crime. Alcohol weakens the mind
in subjection to the awful Ckavk, or morbid desire
for stimulants. The unknown impulse drives the
inebriate to often drink what his palate may even
repel, yet he cannot resist, though he knows him-
self to be drifting to Utter Ruin. At this stage
pledges and punishment prove useless.
The only hope in this condition is to arrest the
crave, eradicate the accumulated alcoholic poison,
and to re-invigorate the nervous and general sys-
tem—to give the subject his self-control and inhi-
bition. Conscious victims—or their friends—
should not delay investigating the marvellous
results achieved by the ORIENT INSTITUTE
for ALCOHOLISM. During the past 18 months
many prominent and valuable men have been
restored to health, Sobriety, and Position in
Life. Inebriates of the most sceptical nature
have been amazed at their restoration.
Cure for Inebriety has been established beyond
all doubt. The U.S. Government has introduced
it into the army, and already numerous States have
legislated for the medical treatment of inebriates.

laroo forward was carried off the field. Fine science was
shown, and Barrie’s kicking was sensational. The second
half began with Handwick leading by 7 to 5, but shortly
another grand kick by Barrie made the Randwick score
10. The Wallaroos charged savagely to retrieve the day,
but the Randwick defence was invulnerable, and
M‘Mahon, their full-back, brought his man down every time
kersmash. Wallaroo eventually brought the score to 8
points, but the Randwick total was 13.

Should Fitzroy gain Yio. football premiership

Essendon in '92, and were third in ’9l.

Fitzroy’a draw with Essendon on Saturday,
5 goals 5 behinds to 5 goals 7 behinds, marks a big quality
decline in this season’s football. Essendon won on
the play, such as it was. but Fitzroy’s performance, if
executed three seasons ago, would rank it somewhere
towards the bottom of the senior list.
The draw between Fitzroy and Essendon leaves
the Vic. football premiership in an interesting position,
as should Fitzroy be beaten to-day (14th), and Geelong
win they tie for first place and will have to play off.

Premier Turner’s lawyer Ministry, enquir-
ing into the question of Melb. police-court
“shamelessness,” will not betaken very seriously.
Some of the most suspected magistrates are re-
garded as particular admirers of the Government’s
legal partners. For instance, their seeming bias
in favor of Turner’s own partner, Sam Lyons, is
a common allegation, and a standing argument
against the admission of shoals of attorneys into
the Legislature. But the modern history of
Smellbourne’s tribunals, from the Supreme Court
downwards, bristles with that argument.

THE UNKNOWN LAND.
There’s a land of the emu and rabbit—
The Australia of Londoners’ tales—
Which no woman, it seems, will inhabit)
For we never hear tell but of males
Who eternally sit
Round a fire and spit,
And their narrative force never fails.
Those who found out that place have decided
And carefully noted it down
That the land into two is divided.
And everything’s “ bush ” but “ the town.''
And they speak with a hush
Of this terrible bush
Where Nature does nothing but “ frown.”
There the scene always matches the story,
For Art unto Nature has neared ;
“Lurid lights to the south ” for the gory,
And “gums grey and gaunt” for the weird.
And the children of toil
Fairly reek of the soil,
And their faces by summer are seared.
Yet under the trees, where it’s shady,
And the thickest of grass ever grows,
Heroes dream of some sweet English lady,
And sniff at the red native rose ;
And not one of the things
Which creep ever stings,
And never the blow-fly blows.
Sydney.

Another Case of “Didn’t Know it was
Loaded.”
“Yes, that is so,” said Mr. Robert Grant, of
Sydenham, New Zealand. I never dreamed that
my system was loaded with uric acid until tor-
tured with muscular rhematism. I caught a
severe cold, which culminated in rheumatism in
the feet and legs, and from this time I was subject
to frequent attacks of rheumatism, which were so
bad as to lay me up, and as all the medicines and
applications failed to relieve or cure me, I had
about resigned myself to perpetual lameness and
pain. But, fortunately, I finally tried Warner’s
Safe Cure and Pills. In a few weeks the swelling
and pain lessened. When I had taken seven
bottles the pains had entirely left, and I have en-
joyed good health ever since. I can highly
recommend Warner’s Safe Cure to anyone suffer-
ing from rheumatism.”
It is unwise to wait for such serious develop-
ments, but as soon as you notice the slightest
deviation from good health, have recourse to
Warner’s Safe Cure, which will soon drive this
subtle poison—uric acid—from the system.
At the Florence-Moody-Hambourg Concert
Company’s matinee, in Melbourne, last Wednes-
day week, the exceedingly pretty dresses and
stylish hats worn by these distinguished artistes
were supplied by Messrs. Hicks, Atkinson and
Sons. Miss Florence’s gown was of pretty spotted
muslin, elaborated with pink, and trimmed with
quantities of soft, foamy lace —the tout ensemble
being very effective. A picture-hat of black lace
and pink straw, trimmed with large straw bow
and ostrich plumes, completed a most becoming
toilette. Miss Moody also wore a muslin costume
of exquisite taste and perfect fit, relieved with
heliotrope ribbons and lace. The head-dress con-
sisted of soft Leghorn, richly trimmed with
ostrich plumes and handsome bows of black satin
ribbon.*
Nathan Herman’s New Premises.
Nathan Herman, the progressive merchant of 9
Wynyard-street, city, promises to transform that
unobtrusive and quiet thoroughfare into one of the
busiest spots in the heart of the city. The ware-
house has been renovated and enlarged, and
recently Messrs. Rowe and Spain, architects,
formally handed the new premises over to Mr.
Herman. A reporter called upon the enterprising
proprietor the other day, just in time to view a
choice shipment of elegant and up-to-date goods,
of which the latest fashions in dress materials,
beautiful in texture and design, were perhaps the
most striking. The labor of transferring the
stock to the'new departments has teen successfully
accomplished by the large staff which was engaged
when the business attained its present proportions.
The basement has been set apart principally for
bedsteads, and the magnificent lighting arrange-
ments, combined with fine display, render a visit
a pleasure as well as a speculative venture. On
the first floor are all classes of carpets, linoleums
and oilcloths, including genuine Brussels carpets
of undoubted value, which are cut and laid for
buyers at the astonishing price of 2s. a yard. The
famous teas (30s. per chest of about 401 b.), which
are packed on the same floor, are meeting with a
remarkable sale. It Would be tedious to dilate at
length upon the surprises of which a visit is pro-
ductive ; suffice it to say that the new premises
are worthy of the stock, and that the stock is
worthy of a continuance of public patronage. All
household furniture and other requirements, from
the simplest lines to handsome pianos, are offered
at prices which must be experienced to be compre-
hended. The boot department has already created a
stir among the firm’s customers, and this section of
the misfit parlor is one of its bulwarks. The pro-
prietor prides himself upon the excellent watches
which are sold, with a chain attached, at ss. lid.
and 7s. fid. Country residents are receiving these
delightful little timekeepers by post. Mr. Her-
man’s £2 parcel is the choicest fruit of his misfit
parlor. It contains : —Two outer shirts, two
undershirts, six pair socks, two neckties, two
collars, six handkerchiefs, one set of studs, a hat,
one pair braces, and a pair of boots, and, crowning
all, a complete suit in excellent material. Men-
tion of Mr. Herman is never complete without a
reference to his superb iron safes, which have
made a name for themselves throughout Aus-
tralia. Tobacco and cigars are also two of the
choicest bargains which the firm supplies.*
THE WOOL TRADE.
The question of economy in handling and selling
wool is one that affects a very large number of our
people. The system pursued by each woolbroker
of keeping separate stores, carting and re-carting
produce to and from the centre of the city, neces-
sarily entails much expense. All this, in some
form or other, has to be paid for by the producer.
In an article written by the National Wool Com-
pany, of Melbourne, it is proposed to erect cen-
tral stores outside the city proper, and in touch
with the River Yarra and the railways. If some
of the other brokers would join in the enterprise it
would be a great step towards securing economy
and despatch, and should receive encouragement
from the wool-growers.*

STATUTORY DECLARATION,
T THOS MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, in the Colony of New
South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows : Whereas I suffered severely from
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to my business. I tried several doctors and many remedies but
a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen s Purely Herbal Alkaline Vitality i'u.LS,
which I solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured M ® a few weeks, a
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. The Alfaline Pills also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.

Wales and Victoria. ,

The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whosetestu
rnonv carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr Rassmussen.— Dear Sir -I think it my duty to
inform you that a course of your Alfalme Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my ne rjous system
and in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their

yi,. _X hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debilitv of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
] am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommeino
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
’.great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated—
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor. •< .
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.

I.—THE ST. ALBAN S ESTATE, con
sisting of 842 acres, situated 3| miles east of
Geelong, Victoria, Australia. The property is
divided into 30 paddocks, many with live hedge
fences.
As a Breeding and Racing Establishment it is
questionable if any more complete place exists in
Europe; certainly it has no rival in Australia.
Originally selected and laid out by Mr. James
Wilson, one of the keenest judges in the colonies,
money has continued to bo freely expended on
improving and perfecting it by Mr. W. R.
Wilson, its present owner, so that it is now one
of the show places of Victoria,
The land is extremely fertile and sound, nearly
all the paddocks being laid down in English
grasses. The Barwon River (2 chains wide and
20ft. deep) intersects the property, thus ensuring
a never-failing supply of fresh water, alike for use
and irrigation. The system for the latter is per-
fect, the drains being most extensive, and the
steam-pumping plant has a capacity of 120,000
gallons per hour. The rainfall is, however, so
good that it is rarely necessary to irrigate more
than two or three paddocks during a summer.
The plantations and hedges, of which several
miles exist, add to the usefulness and beauty of
the estate in a marked degree.
Shelter Sheds of large capacity are placed in
many of the paddocks, while the Yearling
Quarters consist of 40 loose boxes, cool and well
ventilated, built in quadrangular form, and of
ample size. Stone and brick tanks, windmills,
and feed-bins are placed in convenient places in
the various paddocks, and the yards, &c., are
ample and perfectly arranged.
In the centre of the Estate the Training Track
and Course proper are laid out (1J miles and I
mile 5 furlongs round respectively). Both may
well be compared to Flemington or Randwick,
the going being good in all weathers.
The Scraping Sheds are most suitably placed,
and an Elevated Stand commands a most perfect
view of the tracks, river, and estate generally,
with the far-famed Barrabool Hills in the dis-
tance.
The Stalliob Boxes are lofty and well-designed,
opening into a large covefb'd-in exercise ground.
Feed rooms, men’s rooms, &c., are under the
lame roof. The Training Stables are perfect, and
jontain 15 loose boxes, feed rooms, men’s rooms,
and every necessary adjunct to a first-class estab-
ment. Two cottages for stable boys are in close
proximity, and the out-buildings are extensive
and ample.
THE HOUSE—Brick and of modern design,
jonsists of about 30 rooms, and is a perfectly
ippointed gentleman’s residence, beautifully situa-
ted, having a superb view of the You Yang
Ranges and Corio Bay, the latter only two miles
distant.

DICTIONARY
The Princess of Wales’ best-looking
daughter bestrides a two-wheeler. -This faot
can’t he mentioned too often just now, seeing that
dozens of damsels who are neither princesses nor
pretty, ride hikes in order to get themselves pho-
tographed as something special.
Purists in Melbourne object to a foundling-
ho-pital on the ground that it might promote im-
morality. Its absence promotes murder. Mrs.
Grundy —she is the murderer. But the Social

would cover a multitude of sins which it is the
purpose of the Gimletits to discover.
Chief Justice Madden, Yic., on a default-

accordingly. Happily, there is always another
and much more emphatic legal remedy for
Buggins, the laborer, when he embezzles a shoul-
der of mutton or lifts a pair of 4s. lid. water-
tights.

and carries its hands happing weakly in front of
it like the paws of a kangaroo. When he was
young, says this elderly wine and spirit importer,
he was taught to throw out ids chest properly and
Carry his hands with the little finger parallel to the
seam of his pants. All the old men in the House
have big chests, while the young ones —Shiels, for
example—are thin and weedy, and have a feeble
stoop. Carter probably doesn’t make allowance
for the fact that Shiels grew thin and hollow with
his efforts to straighten the finances after the fine,
generous, big-chested old men had tied them up
in a hard knot and left them that way. Ihe
damage that has been done by these big-chested
old men will take a lot of repairing.
At a recent Northam (W.A.) suicide in-
quest one “ Arnold Beard, a youth aged 12 years,
was called, but owing to the incompleteness of bis
knowlege of God and eternity, his evidence was
deemed inadmissible.” So Westralian papers
gravely report. The wisest on earth know of
God and eternity—absolutely nothing ; and, as
Arnold is on a level with the wisest on earth, Ins
evidence was inadmissible. But if Arnold had
learnt the glib cant of the Sunday-school, and
could describe an anthropomorphic deity a mile
high who put little boys into a lake of tire when
they told stories, then Arnold’s evidence wmild
have been accepted without any question. This
paper is somewhat comforted, however, to observe
that the jury’s verdict was “ That on the morning
of July 4th deceased, William Frederick Kadow,
came to his death from the effects of a pistol
bullet wound inflicted by his own hand, whereby
he did feloniously kill himself.” The most sen-
sible suicide verdict The Bulletin remembers.
The Argus, naturally enough, has a pro-
found admiration for London PUNCH, which is
vaguely understood to share with the Bible the
responsibilities of England’s greatness. Says our
contemporary :
That a funny paper can be both humorous and gentle-
manly has been abundantly shown for these 40 years and
more by the London Punch.
There would be no disputing this but for the fact
that Punch is not a funny paper, and is not both
humorous and gentlemanly, as witness its pro-
found contempt for the working-man and the
“lower orders/’ generally. The Argus persists:
PcNCH S humor has never been of a kind to encourage
suspicion, distrust, and cynicism.
That The Bulletin will swear. Its alleged
humor has encouraged nothing but a spirit of
investigation.
Some picturesque stories are told about
the recent great frost in Maoriland, At Kurow,
all the mineral-water bottles in the pub. blew
their corks out with the expansion of the con-
tents. Then a column of the water would fly up-
wards, and, freezing in the air, would remain fixed
like a candle, with the cork on top of it. Most of
the other liquors exploded, and a drink
was left iu Eurow or its vicinity. The meat
froze hard, and so did the whiskers of the resi-
dent*, and the rivers were blocked with ice, and
the thermometer at South Wairarapa fell to 10
degrees below zero. At Benmore, according to
a picturesque local liar, the sheep became so
famished that they assailed anybody who ap-
proached them and ate great pieces of his clothes
off him, thereby compelling him to run for his life
across the snow in a state of partial nakedness.
Everywhere, the very oldest inhabitant lias risen
up and stated, without reservation, that he never
knew anything like it, and he is cordially backed
up by those other two unreliable authorities, the
very old settler and the respected fellow-towns-
man. All three, however, are dying off rapidly
from rheumatism, and, unless the weather mode-
rates, there will hardly be an oldest inhabitant
left.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Hassmussen’s advt. on page

HER MAJESTY
AND

HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE
Prince
The Helmsman .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was his spell at the wheel, and he stood with
his hands carelessly holding the spokes. The
old barque steered easily, and, as she was going
free, a touch either way kept her on her course.
It was Sunday night; dark, cold, axxd threaten-
ing wind. The sea lifted with an uneasy motion,
and the dirty craft rolled and groaned with a
motion still more uneasy. She was only 200 tons
burden —a mere speck on the big, black sea. The
helmsman was alone on deck. Bill and Charley
were asleep in the forecastle. Jack, his watch
mate, was dozing in the cook’s galley, and the
mate was down in his cabin soaking rum.
The helmsman felt that drowsiness which comes
to one when rocked and rolled in the darkness of
night. The splash of the water, the moan of the
wind, the clang of the iron sheets, and the groan-
ing of the masts, as they swung loosely between
the stays, seemed to blend altogether in one
dreary tune. *
The helmsman was thinking of Sunday night at
home, and saw his people sitting in a comfortab'e
room singing ana talking. The Jain beat softly
against his buck ana t ickled down his neck. He
haa neither oilskins nor sou’-weste , not even a
change of cloi hes, for he was a hard-up sailo".
The wind began to hum Lh ough tne rigging,
the ba que heeled over just a little more, but the
change was »o grauuai that the helmsman d.d not
notice it. Suddenly a voice shouted in his ear,
“ Whei-e the h —ll are you see ing? F 1 rouse
you up. Go aloft and stow tne topgallant sail-;
I’ll take the helm. Let go the halliaids and clew
up. ‘
The helmsman gaspx d at the order. The top-
gallant sail was as much as two men could . tow ;
but he oocytd o der- instinctively. He let. o the
h Jiiards, clewed up the sail, and went up aloft to
stow it. He forgot to haul in the braces wnich
hao slackened with the lowiring of the yard.
Up he went on to the bulwarks, into the main
rigging, up the loose xattlinsto the main top, then
over the rim into the topgallant rigging ; swinging
to and fro in the darkness, clinging to shrouds and
stays. He reached the topgallant yard. The sail
was blown out like a balloon and flapped madly in
the wind. The folds of canvas struck against his
face, enveloped him, tore away from him. Ho
leaned over the yard, grasped the sail in his hands,
hauled in the loose folds bit by bit. A gust
came and snatched the sail from his gi’asp.
He struggled with it again, drew folds of it
across the yard, pressed against the folds
with his chest gathered in more, crushed all
the wind out of the canvas, hugged it limp
against the m.ist, triumphed. Now he had to
secure it. He made the bunt fast, then laid out
on the yard to pass the gasket round the sail to
leeward. His only foothold was a swinging rope,
his only finger-hold a thin iron jackstay running
along the yard, so close to the yard that only his
finger-tips could grip it. He shuttled along the
rope, loosened the gasket, and the long coils of
this rope fell from his grasp and blew foul of some
rigging. He curled his left fingers against the
jackstay, groped in the darkness for the gasket,
found it, puiled at it. It was fast somewhere.
He tugged at it, gave a fiercer tug. Horror! his
feet slipped off the hard, wet rope, the yard swung
seaward, and he was dangling over the water,
holding only with the Angers of his left hand. Ho
struggled desperately to reach the yard with his
right, groped madly with his legs to find the foot-
rope, failed, and dangled over black space.
He could not cry out—fear and the awful
struggle for life stopped his breath. He caught a
fi asb of the home scene, then the yard went

"Te Arero Maori.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was on one of my visits as a newspaper corres-
pondent to the interior of the North Island of
Maoriland that the idea of a Maori newspaper
was suggested to me. At the time the Maoris
had plenty of money, derived from the sale of
their lands ; and native friends had no difficulty in
I ersuading me that there was a “good thing in
it.” The Maoris, it was argued, were a distinct
people, with a distinct destiny; and they had
ambitions and aspirations, to voice which a news-
paper was essential. How otherwise could they
become a political force and dictate to the Govt. ?
How spread the principles of temperance and
religion? Clearly, a newspaper was the road to
greatness. And where temperance and religion
were to be the guiding principles, did 1 not possess
exceptional qualities for the conduct of the enter-
prise ? That settled it.
Our first difficulty was the naming of the paper.
A meeting of the proprietors was convened, and
we debated the subject at length. Someone sug-
gested Te Iti ro (the Bird) as a suitable title.
Another thought Taiwara (the Fish) would be
appropriate for a temperance organ. Te Rama
(the Torch) was also put forward. Then Te Pono
(the Truth) was urged as a suitable title for a
newspaper to make the Government tremble. Old
Te Whakawatu, who had subscribed a large por-
tion of the capital, wanted the paper written in a
comic vein. He therefore suggested that we
should call it Te Whakakoekoe (or the Tickler).
This, ho we vex’, did not find favor with one of the
younger men of the tribe, who had t een educated
at a Methodist College, and wanted the title to be
Te Tetere (the Trumpet). Finally, I carried the
day with Te Arero Maori (the Tongue of the
Maori).
Having called up all the available capital, we
cast about for a suitable plant. One of our pro-
prietors proposed to walk in a body to the nearest
European settlement and forcibly carry off the
first newspaper plant we could find. After I had
explained the difficulties attending such an enter-
prise, this idea was reluctantly abandoned. In
the course of a month suitable offices were erected,
plant was secured (and paid for), and Te Arero
was sent upon its mission ; or, as our chairman of
directors, Mr. Nihotunga (Mr. Badtooth) put it,
in his very best metaphor, our “ little canoe was
launched upon the lake of peace.”
After the second number appeared I began to
feel rny responsibility. Three Maori candidates
were standing for one of the Parliamentary divi-
sions, and the board and I sat down one evening
to discuss which should have the support and
influence of “The Tongue.” We unfortunately
failed to agree. The proprietors were divided
into three equal sections, and each section « anted
to boom its own particular candidate, la the end
the matter was left to rny own judgment.
The partisanship which divided the proprietors
soon betrayed itself among the staff. I had the
assistance of an interpreter, a couple of half-caste
compositors and a Maori machinist (who had been
taught the printing art at a missionary station in
the south), besides two or three brown boys who
gave their services in exchange for the privilege
of being connected with the press. My knowledge
of the language being limited, I had to trust
largely to my interpreter, a half-breed and a
bad lot. Everything written for the paper had to
be translated into Maori by this fellow, and he
was not slow to realise the delicate character of
his position, and the possibilities for mischief
which it afforded.
When the election campaign began I wrote an
article singing the praises of Te Pakurangi, one
of the candidates, and urging his claims upon the
Maori electors. A new appointment had been
made to the Native Lands Court bench about this
time, and this was the subject of some flattering
references in the same issue ; the new Judge being
one of my personal friends. The “ staff” not only
objected to my espousal of the claims of Te Paku-
rangi for a seat in Parliament; they also dis-
approved of my complimentary references to the
new Judge. Their disapproval distressed me less
than their method of demonstrating it. For now
I began to appreciate the vicissitudes of aboriginal
journalism.
As I sat alone in my sanctum one day, mentally
complimenting myself on the appearance of the
issue of the Tongue which had just been circu-
lated, my attention was arrested by warlike sounds
at a distance, which seemed to approach nearer and
nearer. Going outside to see what was the
matter, I beheld advancing from a neighboring
hill a band of naked, yelling savages equipped as
if for battle. Puzzled as to what this demonstra-
tion meant, I looked about for a member of my
staff to explain—and it suddenly dawned upon me
that I had not seen any of them since morning.
My interpreter had been missing for two days.
As the warlike party approached I felt re-
assured to see that my friend Pakurangi was at
the head of it. He was waving over his head a
copy of my paper. Clearly he had come to congratu-
late me On my article commending his candidature.
Yet there was something aoout him and his fol-
lowers that did not convey the impression that
their errand was a peaceful one. I was at a loss
how to take them. But they did not long leave
me in doubt.
When they came within fifty yards of the office
of Te Arero, they halted and went through a
performance which to me appeared to be nothing
less serious than a declaration of war. Each man
was armed, and the whole body danced with a
vigor that made the earth tremble.
“Friends,” I said, drawing upon the little
Maori I knew, “ what is it you want of me ? Do
I indeed see the spirit of anger in the eyes of my
brothers ? ”
Te Pakurangi advanced and danced round me
in a paroxysm of indignation. Then he broke into
speech :
“ Brothers? You call us ‘ brothers,’ you white
devil! Brothers, indeed ! Listen to him, Spirit
of my Fathers I ‘Brothers!* Look at that, yon
pale-faced traitor,” and his rigorous frame
trembled with fury as he flung in my face a copy
of the paper.
Clearly there was something in that paper which
Pakurangi did not like, and he had called i ound
in his own simple way to demand an apology. His
feelings were certainly hurt.
“ Friend,” I remonstrated, putting up my hand,
“ Listen, I would speak with you.”
“Speak not, you pakeha dog. Talk to the
winds if you will. Out of the way ! ”
Within five minutes the office of the Maori
newspaper Tb Arkro was levelled with the ground,
the type was scattered to the winds, and the press
rolled into a neighboiing water-hole. The editor
alone was spared.
The “Tongue” which was to speak for the
Maoris had ceased to wag.
That evening I took a copy of the paper to an
interpreter to find out what gave so much offence
to Pakurangi and his people. My suspicions were
confirmed. My staff had sold me cruelly,
Friend Pakurangi was referred to as “a dog ”
and “a bandit,” a man whose hands were “stained
with the blood of the innocenta “brainless
toady,” and the “offspring of a man-eater.” It
was further asserted that he had been in gaol, and
now wanted to get into Parliament to hide his
sins, while a little couplet I had written about his
noble origin was twisted in such a fashion as to
imply a most atrocious libel on the virtue of his
mother. The article I had devoted to congratu-
lating the new Judge was similarly mutilated,
His Honor was referred to as “ a law peddler,”
who sold his judgments, “a cheater of the widow
and orphan,” and a “ hireling crusader against
Truth and Justice.” In another part of the
paper an esteemed missionary was accused of
living in illicit relations with a dark-skinned
beauty; and the Native Minister of the day was
directly warned against “ bartering Government
patronage for the maiden tribute of the Maori
Babylon.”
I did not wait to formally tender my resigna-
tion as editor of Te Akero Maori, but left at
once for another district. No other journalist has
since attempted to supply a “long-felt want” in
that neighborhood.

An assault-case recently tried in Melbourne
ia a fair sample of what a harassed judge and jury
have to struggle with when a hysterical female, or
two of them, get into the witness-box. It began
by a “neatly-dressed girl” giving evidence that
her father had assaulted her. Then she asserted
that he hadn’t assaulted her, but that she had
been driven to say that he had, because a police-
man threatened to have her horsewhipped unless
s he gave evidence to that effect. The policeman
climbed into the box and emphatically denied this
charge. The girl’s sister swore in the first
place that she had seen the assault. Then she
stated that she hadn’t seen it, but her aunt had
told her to say she had. Next she declared
that her aunt hadn’t told her to say anything of
the kind, but a young man had scared her into
saying that the aunt had told her to say some-
thing to that effect. The young man got into the
box just here and denied the charge, and sundry
witnesses testified that he wasn’t present on the
occasion when the threats were said to have been
used. The jury here gave the case up as a had
job, and the Judge, whose hair was grow ing white
beneath the strain, postponed the trial to »" n w
the witnesses time to sort themselves out.

Nell’s Letter .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She had been standing at the open door
since her brother’s early breakfast. The bieak-
fast-tliings were still on the table, just as Bob had
left them ; but her own tea was now cold, and her
bread and bacon remained untasted. Before her
lay the dreary panorama of ridge and gully,
clothed with poverty-stricken gum-trees, which is
common to the northern slopes of the Blue Moun-
tains. The persistent monotony of the sky-line
was broken only by the barren effort of Mount
Hay towards individuality; and at this distant
land-mark Nell was frowning through the sun-
light, her eyes set in an unseeing stare.
She was thinking about a letter. It was not
one she had received, lor she had never received a
letter in her life ; but one she felt she must write.
Was it not nearly six months since Jim had gone
away, yet no word had come to her of his doings
or intentions ? It was nearly summer again, and
she had told herself all along that with the
summer Jim would certainly return. Not that
she blamed Jim; for it was absurd to suppose
that Jim could know of her trouble, seeing that
when he went away she did not know of it herself.
She passed her hand wearily over her brow, fur
she had been thinking deeply, and she was not
used to thinking. She felt that the letter would
be difficult to write. Of course it was for Jim—
her hero, Jim—who never laughed at her blunders ;
yet even with Jim it would be hard to choose her
words. For Nell, though simple, was not stupid.
She was instinctively modest; and then she knew
she must not hurt Jim’s feelings, or say anything
that might be taken as an appeal to his generosity.
Because Jim was a gentleman, a real gentleman,
whose words or actions musf never be called in
question.
So, having thought it all out in her poor little
way, Nell went inside and cleared away thebreak-
fast-things. Then she took the buttle of violet
ink, and the pink paper with the blue lines, and
the ornamental pen with the impossible point.
She spread them laboriously before her on tlie
table, and sat down with her back to the light to
accomplish an act of common justice to her lover.
Pausing olten for inspiration, she tried hard with
her stiff little fingers to keep the wayward,
spluttering pen within the limits ruled for it.
l)ip succeeded dip in the narrow-necked bottle,
blush followed blush over her freckled face, sheet
after sheet of the pink paper was spoilt and
thrown aside; and before the task was done the
afternoon was well-advanced, and the writer was
nearly exhausted. When her name was duly
signed she rose and stretched her limbs, cramped
by the unaccustomed labor. As she moved about
the room, preparing for what should have been
her mid-day meal, she was able to look back upon
her efforts with something approaching compla-
cency ; having, as she hoped, explained the situa-
tion without affront either to Jim or to herself.
When she had taken some tea and food, she
drew from her pocket a crumpled old envelope.
It contained a collar-stud and other trifles, relics
of Jim, and bore the address ;
Mr. JajiesO’Lyon,
Post Office,
Cook a ware a.
This envelope she had found on the flour after one
of Jim’s visits. She had preserved it as a keep-
sake ; but now it was the only link between her
narrow life and the great outside world into which
her lover hud withdrawn.
So Nell copied the address upon a tinted
envelope, tidied her wavy hair and set out with
her letter to the town, carrying an old shawl over
her arm, though it was not cold and the sun was
still high. It u as with a feeling more nearly akin
to happiness than she had enjoyed for some time,
that Nell followed the winding track from the
selection to the town and back again. 1 hat night
she prepared her brother’s tea and endured bis ill-
humor with comparative serenity, comforted by
the thought that everything would soon be right.
* • •
Six weeks had passed, yet no answer had
come from Jim. in spite of herself, Nell was
losing heart. Since the despatch of her letter,
she had walked daily to the post-office to enquire
for an answer; trudging the three miles and
a-half into the town with faint hopes, and the
three miles and a'-half back again with ever-
deepening despair. At first, on tine days, the
walk Was not unpleasant; but, as weeks went by
and the sun grew hotter, the exertion began to
tell upon her. Her head was always dizzy, and
sleeplessness was wearing her down. There came
a day when she fainted on the road, and lay some
time unconscious. She crawled home with diffi-
culty, and next morning she felt too weak to rise
from bed.
So far, she had succeeded in hiding her trouble
from her brother ; but in her weakness and help-
lessness she made up her mind to face the worst,
and tell Boh all about it. So the following morning,
when Bob was breakfasting in moody silence, she
commenced her faltering tale. It was some time
before her brother grasped the situation; but
when, at length, he did understand, he vented his
passion in a torrent of abuse. He even struck
her; for brutal and vulgar minds, when by
accident they find themselves on the side of
respectability, forego none of the privileges of the
position. When he thought his taunts had begun
to lose their sting he left her. On his return at
night the house was empty. Nell was gone.
» • •
The train sped on through the night. It
was just daylight when Nell, shaken and feverish,
left the carriage at Cookawarra. Bor many hours
she had not tasted food ; her head throbbed ; and
she could scarcely stand. The station-master
noticed her. “You seem ill, miss,” he said;
“ would you like to sit down in the waiting-room
for a few minutes? ” „
Nell thanked him, and turned to follow, then
tottered and fell. When she came to, she was
lying on a seat in the waiting-room, and the
station-master was holding a glass of water to her
lips. “Are you better now?”, he asked kindly.
“ Yes, thank you,” she said feebly. He left her
for a moment, and returned, saying, ‘ bit still
awhile, and rest yourself. I’ve brought you the
paper to look at.” She thanked him wearily and
sat up. He went out. closing the door behind
him, and when he had gone Nell took up the
paper, and almost immediately her eye met this
paragraph :
Caught at Last.—When going to press we were
credibly informed that, owing to the praiseworthy
endeavors of Constable Bolger, the notorious swindb r
James O Lvon has at last been brought within reach of
the law. He is now in the lock-up, and will he brought
up at the police-court this morning. A full account of
the proceedings will appear in our next issue.
With a terrible jump at her heart, Nell realised
what this meant to her. She was helpless, home*
less, almost penniless, and her darling Jim was in
prison, charged with—she knew not what—some
terrible mistake—of course, the charge was false.
But how lung would it take for Jim to clear him-
self ? And what should she do in the meantime?
Instantly she made up her mind to go straight to
the lock-up, and to see Jim, if only for a minute.
Boor old J nn 1
So she enquired her way from the friendly
stationmaster, and slowly walked down the quiet
street, gazing absently about her. At last she
reached the lock-up. It stood by itself on the
other side of the town—a rough, wooden building,
bare and forbidding. A short distance away was
the constable’s house, enclosed within a neat fence
along which honeysuckle grew thickly. Nell
walked boldly in anil knocked at the door. No
one answered; r.nd she knocked again. Still there
was no answer, and Nell bethought herself that it
was hardly past five o’clock. If she disturbed
these people they would be offended, and she must
avoid giving offence if she wished to see Jim. She
walked aimles-ly out through the gate, and round
the corner of the honeysuckle hedge, casting many
wistful glances at the lock-up. She would sit
down and rest —her head ached so. She heard
the distant jangling of cow-bells, the cry of mag-
pies, and all the sounds of early morning, while
from the honeysuckle overhead came a perfume
which she inhaled greedily. Then a drowsiness
came over her, and she slept.
* * *
Constable Bolger had been obliged to post-
pone the official overhauling of the prisoner’s
person, and it was about eight o’clock in the
morning when he came out of the lock-up with a
letter in his hand. It was, of course, the con-
stable’s duty to read over any papers found on a
prisoner, so, bracing himself to carry out the work
he had so well begun, he seated himself upon a
comfortable garden chair beneath the honeysuckle
hedge. Having carefully lighted his pipe and
spread out his feet to the sun, he devoted his
attention to the letter, which was queerly written
on pink paper with blue lines, in wayward violet
characters.
It is certainly a very funny composi-
tion, for Constable Bolger rolls about on bis seat
as though a tit were imminent. Now he has read
it through, and looks round for someone with
whom to share his enjoyment. Surely that is
Banks—there, by the lamp post! “ Holloa there,
Banks ! ” roars Bolger. “ Coe-e-e ! Come here;
I want you.”
Banks seems deaf, and the constable roars
again. On the otlu r side of the hedge a tired girl
opens her eyes, and tries to rise. But her head is
whirling—she seems to have no power over her
limbs —she will lie down again—in a little while
she will feel better.
“ Now, then, just listen to this ! ’ chucKles the
constable when bis friend is seated comfortably
beside him, “Listen to this! ‘My own, dear,
beautiful Jim.’ Eh? All right; it’s only the
cows. Never knew Jim O’Lyon did you, Banka .
‘My own, dear, beautiful Jim.’ That’s him in the
lock-up now. He’s a dear, beautiful daisy is Jim ;
but wait. * I hope this finds you in as good health
as it leaves me at present.’ Hope it does, so
help me three buck niggers ! ‘ Since yon went
away it has been cold mostly. O, Jim, what
beautiful days them was before you went away.’
My colonial troubles! Them was eight-hour
days, them was! ‘ I’m not so happy as I was,
because Bob does go on so with drinking and swear-
ing and such like, and there ain’t no one to say
what you used to say.’ No; strike me ugly if
they can any of ’em put it so genteel as the
irresistible Jimmie I ‘I lay awake at nights
thinking of you know who.’ ‘O, my oath, Jim
knows who right enough I ‘0 Jim, if you was
here I could tell you, hut writing ain’t the same,
somehow.* Ha, ha, ha ! Why, what’s the
matter, man? What? Somebody cry out?
\Vby, it’s only them cows laughin’. It ..would
make a snake laugh 1 Sit down. It’s nothing !
Listen ! ‘ But I’ve told no one that you love me.’
James has her on a bit of whipcord this time, and
no mistake. Just listen here! ‘O, Jim,, some-
times I think what mother would have said, but
if she had known you she would say it was all
right, ’cause you are a gentleman and knows best.
But, 0 Jim, do come and see me again in summer
same as you did before.’ Not quite. Probably
James will have other things to do this summer I
‘ With heaps of kisses.’ Rows of ’em ; just look I
What! Going? Well, so long 1 ” And Con-
stable Bolger went inside.
• * •
On the other side of the fence a worn,
pitiful figure lies still, very still. The cows are
beginning to feel the growing power of the sun,
and graze closer in the shadow of the honeysuckle.
One great brindled beast comes and sniffs at the
sleeping figure of the girl, then calmly crops a
tuft of grass which her head is almost touching.
She does not heed it; the hoarse, hollow sound of
the bell upon its neck does not seem to disturb
her slumber.
She lies so very still.

bales of wool this season. He is a selector, not
a buyer or dealer, and last year, according to the
B t oc k-returns, had 3500 sheep. Also, he is a
tobacco-grower, and has now about 20 tons of
tobacco-leaf for sale. Lee Hoy, his neighbor, is
another selector whose clip will be about 40 bales.

OF OMAR KHAYYAM.
The announcement that George Meredith
ottered his maiden speech at the last meeting of
the Omar Khayyam club, awoke (it is to be feared)
in few Australian bosoms a responsive thrill.
Conan Doyle we know, and Anthony Hope ;
of “Ships that Pass” and “Trilby” we can
prattle with assurance; but George Meredith,
“ the greatest living master of English fiction
how rare his disciples in the booksellers' flock !
As for Omar Khayyam—ask for him at the
counter, and observe the more than Egyptian
darkness which shrouds the bland assistant’s
phiz ! Yet among all the guides, philosophers
and friends that Man has vouchsafed unto men—
not forgetting Solomon, and his brother Ecclesi-
astes, and his cousin Eeclesiasticus (a most admir-
able-foolish cuss); not forgetting Horace, and
Sterne, and Montaigne, and the grave Antoninus
—there is none like unto Omar—none !
Meredith is “ tough ” —to the flippant literary
slap-dasher. Maybe. So is Henry George (not his
sentences, but his ideas). Yet j t ou will meet more
than one enthusiastic Single - taxer who has
assimilated “Progress and Poverty” as thoroughly
as a Plymouth Brother his Bible. What saith
(with emphatic inversion) the Scriptures : “ Unto
whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much
required.” And Meredith gives more than he
requires by 90 times 9 —and ever so many ciphers.
The book to begin on. of course, is “ The Ordeal
of Richard Feverel,” which most appeases the
hunger for plots—and chapters 15 and 20 may
be dipped into by way of foretaste. Anyone then
who gets no farther, deserves not to —which is a
cruel thing to say, but quite fair in the circum-
stances.
Omar is another matter (Khayyam —“the tent-
maker ” —is a tagged poetical pen-name, like—a
suitable modern parallel that won’t come to mind).
Money cannot really be measured against Fitz-
gerald’s Omar—practically the only one worth
knowing ; but, commercially speaking, there is no
“ cheap ” edition (the least price is 11s. posted;
and Eli Vender's famous illustrations run his
edition up to anything over £r> 55.), so that the
book is better not bought if anywhere, from any-
body,, you can borrow a copy and learn it by heart
—there are only 101 stanzas in the latest version.
Only 101 stanzas —begotten of Omar, conceived
and born of Fitzgerald, with the wit and wisdom
painfully gathered by a million philosophers of
East and West inherited and distilled in their
fragrance ! And the essence of all is
Cakpe Diem !
“ Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink
thy wine with a merry heart. Let thy garments
be always white; and let thy head lack no oint-
ment. Live joyfully with the wife whom thou
lovest all the days of this vanity—thy life.”,
A. Book of __ Vernes underneath the Bough,
A“Jiig of Wine, a Loaf of Bread —and Thou
Beside me singing ip th§ Wilderness—
Oh, Wilderness were Paradise "enow !
Every Omarist lip his favorite verse, in J]ita-
gerald’s exquisite metre. Herels'one (spoken by
a “ shape of clay ” in the “ Potter’s house ”) :
“ Well,” murmured one, “lei? whoso make or buy,
My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry :
But fill me with the old familiar Juice,
Methinks I might recover by and by ! ”
Another i
And much as Wine has play’d the Infidel,
And robb’d me of my Robe of Honour —Well,
I wonder often what the Vjntners buy
One-half so precious as the stuff they sell.
Others: —
I must abjure the Balm of Life, I must,
Scared by some After-reckoning ta’en on trust,
Or lured with hope of some Diviner Drink,
To fill the Cup—when crumbled into Dust !
Oh threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise !
One thing at least is certain — This Life flies ;
One thing is certain and is Lies;
The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.
Strange, is it not ? that of the myriads who
Before us pass’d the door of Darkness through,
Not one returns to tell us of the Road,
Which to discover we must travel too.
I sent my Soul through the Invisible,
Some letter of that After-life to spell:
And by and by my Soul return’d to me,
And answer’d “ I Myself am Heav’n and Hell: ”
Heav’n but the Vision of fulfill’d Desire,
And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire,
Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves
So late emerged from, shall so soon expire.
Best of all :
Some for the Glories of This World ; and some
Sigh for the Prophet’s Paradise to come ;
Ab,’take the Cash, and let the Credit go,
Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum !
PERIODICALS.
With the excellent Aug. number, Pall Mall
Magazine raises its price Gd. (now 2s. sd. posted).
It has Jong been obvious that this, the most sump-
tuous of English magazines, must be printed
at a loss, in spite of its fine array of advts. Pro-
bably the circulation in England, where its patrons
belong to a class which does not value incidental
sixpences, will be unaffected by the change ; but
the Australian sale is likely to decrease. So many
good books are obtainable at 2s. or 2s. Gd. that the
Pall Mall, still splendid value, goes down con-
siderably in the scale of comparative value ; and
the Australian buyer, though he never grudges
his money, always wants to make the best bargain
possible.
The Aug. English Illustrated (lid.) is a
specially good number of a specially good maga-
zine. A tale —“ With Madness in his Method ”
a charming example of the lighter American style
—and the continuation of Weyman’s “Memoirs
of a Minister of France,” plead for space-forbidden
comment; and one illustration, “Dawn,” is the
prettiest anywhere to be seen this month.
The July Englishwoman (lid.) is well-varied
and readable. The best story is Richard Pryce’s
“ Book of the Curl.” Frankfort Moore gives
another glimpse of that remarkable country,
English-Australia.
The Album for July 15 (Bd.) cannot be too
highly praised. The illustrations are exquisite,
particularly those which depict the beautiful
Thames from Oxford to Hampton Court. This
weekly is well worth a continuous subscription
(15s. Gd. per half-year).
The July Yellow Book (Gs. 6d.) doesn’t reach
previous standards ; it has less originality, less
literary value. There are one or two good pic-
tures ; the verse (with the exception of a trans-
lation from the Portuguese) is dim and eoho-y;
only two stories can be called good—“in an
American Newspaper Office,” and “ A New
Pos'ter.” Kenneth Grahame’s “ Long Odds ”is a
clever and suggestive paper.
The July Forum (375. per annum) has a par-
ticularly good article by Frederic Harrison on
“Charles Kingsley’s Place in Literature” —the
eighth of a splendid series which will be well
worth buying when republished. Harrison is a
better critic than Saintsbury ; and no less pleasant
a writer.
SOME RECENT BOOKS.
“ Australian Zoology,” by G. Metcalfe, M.A., a
N.S.W. State school-teacher, is published by E.
W. Cole at Is. 3d. (posted), and is heartily recom-
mended as a most interesting book, worthy a
much better dress. Mainly, of course, it is com-
pilation ; but the work is exceedingly well done,
and the little volume should be bought by every-
one interested in Australian birds, beasts and
fishes.
Gunsberg’s just-published “Chess Openings”
(Is. 3d.) is a very good little manual, with the
great advantage of being up-to-date. (Other good
chess books are Green’s general handbook (Is, 3d.);
Staunton’s Hand-book, Praxis, and Chess-player’s
Companion (ss. 6d. each); and Morphy’s Games
(ss. Gd.). A more scientific book is Horwitz and
Kling’s “ Chess Studies and End Games ” (Bs. 3d.).
Steinitz’s “Instructor” (11s.), of which only
Part I. is yet published, is the completest so far
as it goes.)
“ Almayer’s Folly ” (paper, 35.; cloth, 45.), by
Joseph Conrad, is a powerful tale of life in Borneo
-which has been father over-praised by the English
press—always grateful to the writer who exploits
a new milieu. The central idea is the struggle
between civilised and barbaric instincts in a half-
white, half-yellow girl ; and her Dutch father’s
broken heart when barbarism triumphs and she
rushes to the arms of a Malay lover, is the last
drop in a cup of tragic life-failure.
Percy Fitzgerald supplies a gossipy, readable
“Life of Henry Irving” (paper, Is. 3d. ; cloth,
Is. lOd.)
“ The Cult of Beauty, a manual of personal
hygiene ” (35.), by C. S. Thompson, is an elegantly -
gotten-up little book, for which any lover would
deserve the thanks of his lady.

NOTES.
Alex. Lindsay is issuing an “ Australander
series ”,(ls. 3d.), to include new books by favorite
Australian authors. The first number, “His
Native Wife,” by Louis Becke, will bo out in three
or four weeks.
Booksellers find Morris’s “Life of Higin-
botham ” very dead stock. The life of a democrat
should certainly be published at a more demo-
cratic price than 9s. Bd. (posted).
The late Sir James Stephen put a familiar life-
philosophy in some lines quoted by his biographer-
brother Leslie:
The know-nothing books may alarm you ; but
many a better man
Knows he knows nothing and says so, and lives
the best life he can.
If there is a future state, face its hopes and terrors
gravely;
The best path to it must be to bear life’s burthens
bravely.
And even if there be none, why should you not
live like a man,
Enjoying whatever you have as much and as long
as you can ? ”
Melb. and Sydney retailers complain bitterly of
the ladies —generally related to most influential
personages —who get parcels of new books sent
home “on appro.,” and return them after any
time from two months to two years ; when, of
course, they are quite unsaleable. “My relation,
Sir Blank Blank,” covers a multitude of book-
lenders’ curses.
New volumes in the pretty pocket edition of
Chas. Kingsley (Is. lOd. each) are the “ Poems ”
and “Alton Locke.”
Miss Wilkins, a writer of charming American
village tales, has won the Chapman’s Magazine
first prize of =£loo for a short detective tale, “ The
Long Arm. ” Brander Matthews, another Ameri-
can, came second among 3000 competitors.
Some Books Worth Reading.
This list is eclectic, not comprehensive;
and the compilation has been guided chiefly
by the average reader’s pocket-compass.
