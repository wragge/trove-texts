Hospitals of Great Britain, Paris, Berlin and Vienna, and
in private practice. Formerly House Surgeon to the
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Maternity and Lock Hospitals.
No medical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can be compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEGALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR
advertising in these colonies who combines with special
Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old,
Suffering from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,
specks before the eyes, giddiness, weakened
memory, pains in the backhand chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor, sterility, premature decay, stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-
cines will be forwarded to them. On receipt of
2s. 6d. he will forward his book on the “ Male
Generative Function in Health and Disease,”

The Co-Operative
SYSTEM, the nearest approach to Socialism that can he achieved under the
present conditions of life, has met with phenomenal success wherever it has
been applied to any object. In England, even the Co-operative Societies
benefit some millions of persons—their membership exceeding a million and
a-half, and hold invested capital to the amount of eleven millions of money.
This success is owing to the fact that the investor sees not only a fair com-
mercial return on his investment, but a proprietary division of profits, which
he would not receive from any other organisation. It has been left to Aus-
tralia to apply this communistic’ principle to

SxVTURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1891.
Roses and Asafoetida.
“You may break, you may shatter, the vase,
if you will, but the odour of roses will cling
to it still.” Thus sings a poet. That other
odoriferous material which is named in the
heading of this article appears not to have
been fraught with suggestion to the poetic
imagination. Lions have ramped and snakes
have crawled in many a fluent verse ; but no
one has adventured even so much as a
sonnet on the skunk. And yet it would
seem to be, in some sense, apropos of the
latter animal that Queen Victoria has been
pleased to elevate to the peerage of Great
Britain the relict of the Grand Old Man of
the Dominion of Canada, Sir John Mac-
donald, Of course we take no interest in
the lady thus ennobled. What we enjoy is
our own reflections respecting the cause of
her elevation —viz., the distinguished ser-
vices of her late spouse. Sir John Mac-
donald was undoubtedly a very remarkable
man. The gigantic dimensions of his politi-
cal stature rendered him visible even at the
distance which separates Australia from
Canada, long before that enthusiastic apostle
of mud and holiness, Mr. Stead, had a fit of
printed hysterics on merely contemplating
the grandeur of the Canadian statesman.
It is perhaps a testimony to the purely
inspirational origin of Mr. Stead’s convul-
sions, that in the course of the same fit
he frothed at the mouth about Sir John
Macdonald, Sir Henry Parkes, and Mr.
Cecil Rhodes. At the same time that asso-
ciation of individuals may possibly be re-
garded as somewhat derogatory by any one
or any two of the triplet so grouped. Still,
in Mr. Stead’s very next severe seizure the
spirit moved him to bear testimony to the
pure and lofty motives which actuated the
Prince of Wales in maintaining, as part of his
travelling equipment, a gambling-kit, and in
cracking the crib of a serious family with
those tools, and so the trio are in good
society.
# * *
Respecting Mr. Cecil Rhodes, the Cape
Premier, not much is yet known. The
salient features in the non-teetotal career of
that great man, so far, are confined to the cir-
cumstances that his first appearance in South
African society was as a street-huckster in
Capetown, that ho joined the Diamond-fields
rush, struck it rich, became monstrously
wealthy, bought himself into public life,
evinced possession of masterful talent and
inordinate ambition, and seems inclined and
qualified to checkmate the Boer aspirations.
Mr. Rhodes, however, is comparatively a
young man, and only time can show whether
lie is reasonably entitled to figure in the
same category with Macdonald and Parkes.
The flavour of Mr. Cecil Rhodes is not as
yet very powerful or clearly defined. Res-
pecting Parkes, who emits his sweet-
ness in our immediate vicinity, there can, of
course, be no mistake. His moral odour
speaks for itself. And as for Sir John
Macdonald, he is dead, but his reputation
certainly predeceased him. That is to say, if
the term “reputation” be employed in a
wholesome sense. For many years past all
who knew him have been conscious that an
odour of corruption diffused itself from the
decayed matter which the creatures of the
Canadian statesman called lbs public charac-
ter. The man was understood to be one of
consummate tactical skill in politics, and
totally unscrupulous as to the methods by
which he maintained his supremacy. The
broad outlines of his qualities were probably
seen more justly by persons at a distance
than by those nearer to him. It is truly
remarkable how accurately the really pro-
minent characteristics of a notable public
man come to be understood where there
exist no interested reasons for distorting
them.
* # #
The great ability of the deceased Canadian
statesman is evidenced, in the first place, by
the extraordinary collapse of the entire
political system which he created and main-
tained while alive, and which died along
with him. All through his latter years it
was generally understood that his power was
founded on and sustained by the most
shameless corruption. But so expert had
“Old To-morrow” become in staving off
exposure, that so long as he lived he was
able to set his opponents at defiance, and
attitudinise as not merely an able but an
upright administrator. In this style of
posturing he was powerfully assisted by his
constant assumption of Imperialistic zeal,
and of personal loyalty to the throne. To
cast aspersions on the methods and character
of the one colonial statesman whom the
Sovereign distinguished above all others was
to fly in the face of Majesty, and asperse
alike the sagacity and the integrity of the
Queen’s advisers, and of the Queen herself.
A swarm of highly-placed Ministeis, of
leading officials, of social personages, of
wealthy monopolists and influential em-
ployers of labour, of favoured or subsidised
journalists, and of aspirants after office,
vehemently asserted the absolute impecca-
bility of their revered ringleader. He lived
by corruption and hired grovel, and when
lie died his character fell to pieces on the
instant.
* * •
The first shock was dealt by the mere
publication of the dead statesman’s will.
The simple circumstance that Sir John
Macdonald had in possession certain shares
in the Canadian trans-continental railway
spread confusion and consternation through-
out the Dominion. It was not merely
because his wealth proved to be more con-
siderable than could bo reconciled with his
pursuits and apparent transactions and
opportunities ; the particular nature of these
securities gave sinister significance to the
fact that they were in his possession
at all. They had been kept a secret
from his contemporaries, as a wealthy
financier might have kept forged bonds or
stolen scrip. Under no conceivable circum-
stances could they have come honestly into
his hands, and how they might have become
his by corruption was so obvious that no one
but a simpleton could overlook the proba-
bilities.
* * *
After some desperate efforts to explain
away the unexplainable, recourse was had to
silence. The only device available in the
case of an irremediable exposure was adopted.
The scandal was “hushed up.” Immense
influence must have been exerted to
achieve this end. The press purist,
Stead, found his spirit moved to cast
a halo of eulogy around the repu-
tations of Sir John Macdonald, Sir
Henry Parkes, and Mr. Cecil Rhodes
simultaneously with the outcropping in
Canada, in Australia, and in the Cape
Colony of indications that a comprehensive
Imperialistic conspiracy to draw tighter
“ tlxe golden bonds” was in active opera-
tion. This was immediately succeeded by
an almost reckless attempt to whitewash the
besmirched reputation of the Prince of
Wales. The source and fountain-head of
influence is not difficult to discover by these
indications. The “ hushing-up ” process in
relation to Sir John Macdonald’s plunder
might have succeeded had he still lived.
But death having stilled his master hand and
ingenious brain, the gang of public robbers
of which he had been the patron and pro-
tector were left without a leader. Dis-
organisation and dismay assailed them.
They were very corrupt, like their dead
chief, but not, like him, as dexterous as they
were conscienceless. One after another
they succumb under the stress of investiga-
tion, until at length a scare has set in, and
their once imposing attitude has been aban-
doned, and is supplanted by a regular
satire qui pent. Government contractors,
having no longer the influence of the once
omnipotent Premier to shield them, endea-
vour to anticipate compromising disclosures
by voluntary informations, probably told in
the way least damaging to themselves.
Fearful that if they persist in their long-
sus'ained silence, they will be condemned as
accomplices, they solicit commiseration as
the victims of political and official black-
mailers. A State Premier’s financial secre-
tary absconds almost at the same time as a
member of the Legislature bolts. The latter
had refused to answer interrogatories, alleging
the singular plea that he could not do so
without implicating his political associates.
The great departments of State are dis-
covered to have been hot-beds of corruption
and embezzlement. Atrocious consequences
these of the decease of an alleged Grand Old
Man !
* # *
This Canadian catastrophe is fruitful of
premonitions for communities similarly cir-
cumstanced. Wherever there exists a
G.0.M., around ivliosc career hangs an
odour of corruption, there similar disclosures
may be expected when any event removes
the chief actor from the scene without
chance of restoration. The lesson should
be regarded as peculiarly pregnant of warn-
ings, in any community where a powerful
leader scarcely manages to repress present
revolt, even while at • the summit of his
influence. If there should ever exist, for
example, a province, the political head of
which has a reputation which stinks in the
nostrils of his neighbours, and is only en-
dured by exertion of the most charitable
suspension of judgment and exceptional
laxity of principle among bis own fellow-
citizens, there a catastrophe similar to that
which has occurred in Canada may be
reasonably apprelundcd. And when such a
man is made the mark of the most flagrant
aspersions, assailing alike his morals, his
commercial probity and bis political inte-
grity, and yet fails to put l lie law into opera-
tion to silence and punish his detractors,
some frightful scandal must be looked for as
inevitable the moment the weight of his
personal influence's removed. Men of such
a stamp resemble those fabled wretches who
sold their souls to the Devil for as urance of a
period of brilliant prosperity. They gain the
brilliance and the prosperity only to find
that these are Dead Sea fruit, fa»r to out-
ward view, but to the consumer full of
nought but bitterness and ashes. The end
of it all is constantly present before their
minds. They contemplate with horror and
despair the day or the night when their
infernal master will claim them, and leave
behind the tokens of their bargain in a
blackened and blasted reputation. Vainly
they strive and struggle by every imaginable
device to defeat the contract. They hire
scribes to prepare in advance of the
catastrophe, eulogies to serve for biographies.
They write their own memoirs in blazons of
virtue and worth. They masquerade as
saints, with the object that when they are
gone, people may be slow to recognise that
they were damned in advance.
** • #
The evil such men do “ lives after them,”
while the little go >d they may have accom-
plished “is buried with their bones.” A
political leader, such as has been portrayed,
corrupts an entire community, and if
be live long enough debases more than
one generation. As he sways the
destinies of a people, and exercises the
power to make or mar, in some degree,
the fortunes of individuals, it is soon recog-
nised that uprightness and loftiness of prin-
ciple are no guarantees of worldly prosperity.
The unscrupulousschemer finds theback-doors
which lead, over gutters and sewers, to the
place where fat contracts and comfortable
billets are arranged, always ajar to him. The
ambitious youth, aflame for a career of dis-
tinction, the acquisitive anhungered-after
aTliicncc, perceive that virtuous squeamish-
noss will more likely mar than mend them,
’i lie places of pride, the seats of power, the
.si! utions of emolumentare allotted preferen-
tially to accomplices, confederates, tools,
and sycophants, who have either no preju-
dices against corruption to overcome, or who
are too weak to resist the influence of
example, or too worldly-wise to refrain from
conformity with iniquity. The poison
extends through all conditions of men. The
foreman and the confidential clerk learn how
it is that this employer never fails to secure
profitable jobs, while that has his tenders
set aside. Neither sex escapes the infection.
The very school-girls, whose education
and up-bringing the State has made its
peculiar care, may be taught by example
thrust upon their notice, that it is more
advantageous to play the harlot to an in-
fluential debaucher than to seek haj piness in
virtue and a marriage in their own condition
of life. Thus the venom engendered by one
vicious being penetrates every stratum of
society, and ravages its inmost tissues.
Generations have to pass away before the
foul corruption is fairly expelled. But per-
chance we declaim in vain.
An Established. Church for Australia.
On a recent Sunday, at St. James’ Church,
Sydney, a lecture was given by the incumbent,
the Rev. 11. Latimer Jackson, on “Some
arguments in favour of an Established
Church.” It is quite a new departure for
The Bulletin to devote more than a short
paragraph to clerical vagaries, but Mr. Jack-
son’s lecture so felicitously showed the width
of the chasm separating the lay from the
clerical mind—so aptly illustrated the fact that
the ordinary clergyman is entirely out of touch
with the community which surrounds and sup-
ports him—that the discourse, if but for its
bizarrerie, deserves something more than a
brief analysis. For reasons that are unfor-
tunately but too apparent the clergy have been
described as “ the third sex.” The designation,
if a little rude, cannot in fairness be con-
sidered undeserved. In their teachings, and
sometimes in their conduct, the most note-
worthy feature is the almost entire absence of
that virility which characterises the vigorous
masculine intellect, as well as of the delicacy and
originality to be found in the refined female in-
telligence. It is through this cause, among many
others tending in the same direction, that their
views in these days have came to be regarded
cither with good-natured toleration or with
undisguised indifference, not to say contempt.
Mr. Jackson began by inviting bis bearers to
consider bow important it was that true religi 011
“ should make headway in this young country ”
Conceding this, the question naturally suggests
itself: “Which is the true religion?” q 1 ],
nations of antiquity made remarkable progress
under false faiths. Surely no belief at all j s
better than an erroneous one ; so that, if th e
Greeks and Romans, while worshipping dozens
of now discredited divinities, transmitted to
posterity not alone model laws, but literary
and artistic masterpieces of unequalled excel-
lence, what might they not have done had they
but adopted the Jewish Jehovah as their God’
Yet, the decline of Rome might be almost said
to date from her acceptance of “ the true faith.”
Nor should it be forgotten that to this true
faith was owing the long millennium which
spread like a pall over Europe, substituting dirt
debauchery and ignorance for the enlightenment
that had gone before. With such a lesson
before us it is hard to admit the necessity for the
spread of true (dogmatic) religion in any country
young or old. Still, as we have conceded the
necessity, we have no desire to draw back. The
question now is to discover the genuine one and
expeditiously adopt it.
# # *
The quest, according to Mr, Jackson, is by
no means difficult. There can be but one true
religion. It is almost superfluous to add that
the Rev. H. Latimer Jackson has found it. R
is the parliamentanly-established Church of
England, whose first head was the matrimonially,
experienced Henry VIII., and whose coming
Rope is the Prince of Wales. With M. Tudor
and his harem at one end and M. Wettin and
his gambling-kit at the other, he would be a
bold person wdio questioned the sacred character
of the institution. At the same time it would
be idle to deny that such disagreeable and
sceptical people exist. The Nonconformists are
powerful in Australia; so are the Roman
Catholics; and so also are those who never enter
a church, except when brought to it by their
parents to be baptised, by some woman to he
married, or by their executors to be buried.
Each of these bodies derides the claims of the
English establishment, while the Salvation
Army flouts all. The Church of England,
according to the late Cardinal Newman, who
should.be an authority, having spent the best
years of his life in her service, is a schismatic
body whose members will suffer in the next
world for their contumacy in this. It may be
that in Australia the English Church is (on
paper) the strongest sect, but she is certainly
not so strong as all the others combined. Were
she subsidised, therefore, it would merely mean
the withholding of State aid from the majority
so as to confer it on a minority. It devolves on
Mr. Jackson then, to prove, not that his sect
embraces the majority of churchgoers, which is
impossible, but that it is the true one. He may
succeed in doing so, but in everyday language,
he has a hard row' to hoe.
# # *
Three courses are open : (a) discover the true
faith and subsidise it; (b) subsidise all; (c)
none. The last plan is that pursued in Greater
Britain—be., in English-speaking countries
beyond the United Kingdom, with the excep-
tion of India, which can scarcely as yet be con-
sidered a country of Anglo-Saxon speech. In
it there are English prelates and priests whose
success in everything beyond drawing liberal
salaries is still problematical. They no doubt
do their best to prove the superiority of Christ’s
teaching to that of Buddha or Brahma, but
the inhabitants of the great Asiatic dependency
are of a Conservative nature and do not take
readily to the truth either in religion or politics.
11l Ireland, too, the partnership between Church
and State—a partnership upheld by bayonets
tor centuries—has been dissolved ; while Wales,
Scotland, and even England itself show' unmis-
takable symptoms of a desire to terminate the
connection. The fact, then, that Church and
State do not go well together in harness is not
only acknowledged as an axiom among people
of British descent beyond the seas, but is
forcing itself upon the attention of millions in
Great Britain. Bearing this in mind, it is not
too much to concede to Mr. Jackson a certain
amount of courage in advocating the re-mar-
riage in Australia of this divorced and ill-
assorted couple.
* * *
Regarding the second course—that of subsi-
dising all churches, as the Catholic, Pro-
testant, and Jewish faiths are in France.
Assuming that all the people of Australia
were church-goers of some kind, the prin-
ciple is tantamount to taking money out of
one pocket and putting it in another. The
only scheme even partially consonant with
common sense would be one that divided the
entire subsidy among the ecclesiastical estab-
lishments in proportion to the attendance.
Upon the injustice of this method to the bulk
of the population who never voluntarily attend
a place of worship at all, except through curio-
sity, it is scarcely necessary to dwell. They,
the non-churchgoers, would naturally say, “If
you want priests pay tor them. We decline to
be taxed in order that you may have your
religion cheap—in order that you may rejoice
in choirs, surplices, and sermons w'hich we con-
sider relics of an ignorant past.” It would be
hard to find an answer to such an objection.
If a person finds that incense and platitudes are
essential to his present and future Avelfare it is
surely not too much to ask him to pay for them.
Indeed, his hesitation to do so, or his desire to
get non-believers to share the expense so that
he may obtain salvation at the lowest monetary
figure, is not without a suspicion of meanness.
Of a certainty, a sincere man who conscien-
tiously accepted the doctrine of sempiterna
happiness or misery, would not hesitate to
avoid the latter and make certain of the former
by drawing a cheque to assist in squaring m®
back-slidings. A story told by X ado mm
[O’Meara’s “Voice froni St. Helena ] 1
apropos. The Emperor speaks :
1 recollect when I was in Italy, a priest preaemngabou
a poor sinner who had departed this life. n
appeared before Gon, and he was required to if>' '
account of all his actions. The evil and the £00”
afterwards thrown into opposite scales to see whicn I
dominated. That containing the good proved nmen
lighter, and instantly flew up to the beam. I* 1 " UA
soul was condemned to the infernal regions, c ®* , V :’| S .
by angels to the bottomless pit, delivered over ton, -j
aiid thrown into the flames. “Oh! patron saint, ■
he, "look down upon me ;oh ! take compassion ™


and throw into the scale of my good deeds all the
!■ ’ an d stone which I gave to repair the convent of
” His saint instantly took the hint, gathered
, e ther all the lime and stone, threw them into the scale
nf"s-ood which immediately preponderated ; the scale of
vil sprung up to the beam, and the sinner’s soul into
paradise at the same moment.
The priest’s story, we read, was given to the
congregation to induce them to help in building
a new convent. It had the desired effect as,
for some days subsequently, the neighbouring
roads were blocked with cart-loads of eleemosy-
nary stone and lime. To us it appears that if
the condemned sinner alluded to had induced
the Government to provide the lime and stone
instead of bestowing them himself, he would
still be in Hades, with a certainty of a long
stay. This may suggest to Mr. Jackson how
necessary it is that persons who believe in
Hades should themselves pay to keep out of it,
instead of begging their neighbours to pay for
them- #
gut the real crux of the question is to dis-
cover the true Church. Nothing is too good
for it when once discovered. During the 18th
century an English Catholic or a French Protes-
tant was sure of an unpleasant here and here-
aftcr —so far as the Church, backed rip by the
State, had a say in the matter. It is intrinsi-
cally stony-hearted to make a man pay for your
Church, and at the same time assure him that
he will be damned for adhering to his own.
Surely it is cruelty personified to punish him in
both worlds—in the present by seizing his
goods, in the future, by seizing his soul. Before,
therefore, a step forward can be taken in the
matter of establishing a State Church, it is
incumbent on Mr. Jackson to prove which is
the infallible one. This he, no doubt, can
readily do to his own satisfaction, but that is
not enough. He must do it to the satisfac-
tion of the Government and of the popular
majority. From what is known of the
present New South Wales Administration
and its leader, there can be little looked
for in that direction —even if the Labour-party
gave a block vote in favour of the scheme.
The chance of Sir Henry Pabkes, Premier of
Mr. Jackson’s province, establishing a parti-
cular sect for the purpose of preserving the
public morals, is improbable. Nor is there much
hope from the Opposition. The members of the
latter are too busily engaged in the effort to
establish themselves on the Speaker’s right, to
spare time for the adoption of any new beliefs.
So it would appear that even when Mr. Jackson
has succeeded in selecting the true faith, his
work will be but begun. The Fates are against
him from the start.
* * *
“ A country where God was not recognised
at all could never prosper nor reach true
national greatness.” So says Mr. Jackson,
Yet the French got on very well after the
enthronement of a cocotte as the Goddess of
Reason. They even pulled down thrones under
this droll tutelary—thrones, moreover, which,
according to the proclamations of their occu-
pants, had been founded and upheld An nom de
latres sainte et indivisible Trinite. In fact,it was
only after the Concordat with Rome that the
Gallic star began to wane. Besides, as pre-
viously hinted, the great nations of antiquity
prospered remarkably well under false gods,
although it is obviously better to have no
Deity at all than spurious ones. The Eastern
barbarians, with not a respectable divinity in
their Pantheon, sacked Rome, which possessed
not alone a richly-endowed State Church, but
relics of saints innumerable. So it would have
been with London in 1805 had the indolent
Villeneuve given Bonaparte what he wanted
—the command of the Channel for a few days.
Once landed in Kent or Essex, the whole
English army, headed by the Regent and full
bench of bishops, would have been powerless to
prevent a victorious march on Babylon. It is
to be feared that the soldiers who, a few
months later, smashed the European coalition
at Austerlitz would have made short work of
King, Lords and Hierarchy.
# * *
Mr. Jackson believes that “ the propagation
of religious truth is one of the ends of Govern-
ment,” that an Established Church was the
‘ ‘ practical recognition of the spiritual character
of the State,” and that “a perfectly free
church had not proved an universal blessing. ’
The “spiritual character of the State’
especially with the four Georges, not to men-
tion “Silly Billy ” and the prospective Edward
VII. as successive Popes—is very fine, ihc
Romanists, it is true, could boast the Borgias
and other beauties, but, leaving out the poison-
ing proclivities, we would back the Guelphs
against all-comers for spiritual guides. In
Great Britain alone it takes over seven millions
sterling a year to support the Establishment.
What does the nation receive in return ? I he
blocking of all liberal measures by a posse of
bishops who, if Christ appeared among them
to-day, would commit Him to prison as a vagrant
and an impostor. Thoughtful Englishmen are
gradually coming round to the opinion that the
worst thing which ever happened their country
was the non-appearance of Bonaparte’s bear-
skins in St. James’s and St. Giles’s. Unpat-
riotic to say so ? Bah ! Go to England and
see the rich rectors whose wives would not
touch a labourer with their fans —to Wales and
observe the greasy parsons with their _ bailiffs
and soldiers garnering the poor man’s crop
which they never sowed. They pounce upon
his barn in the name of God, and millions begin
to ask wdiy in God’s name the iniquity is
tolerated.
* * *
Free churches are not an unmixed blessing —
for the clergy. The latter have to work for
their living and are promptly told when they
are required no longer. What wonder that
Australian ecclesiastics should sigh tor the flesh-
pots of an Establishment ? The Apostles,
when preaching was slack, worked at their
trades to fill in time. What was good
enough for them and even for J esus
Himself is surely good enough for a
modern pastor. Suppose the State decided to
acknowledge an Establishment, but without
endowments of any kind. Would there be a
rush for appointments ! We smile. '1 here is
no opportunity at present to expose the fallacy
°f supposing that morality and what is called
religion go hand-in-hand. Over and over again
it has been shown that there is .no necessary
connection between the two, while there is a
very strong bond between morality and educa-
tion. Some of the world’s most exalted charac-
ters have professed either no faith at all or a
very indifferent one, while most of the world’s
moral monsters have been devotees. Mr.
Jackson has come to the wrong country at
the wrong time to impose on a free community
the tags and tatters of obsolescent superstition.
The “Mildura” Stokers.
The S.M. Herald, the champion explainer and
boss apologist of New South Wales, has risen
to wipe out and utterly abolish the latest dis-
graceful scandal connected with the alleged
“Australian” fleet. It has done it in the
manner for which the S.M. Herald is famous,
by first liquoring in an affable manner with the
Admiral, who stated that there was nothing at
all the matter with the famous Mildura, and
next liquoring cheerfully with the captain, who
repeated his assertion. Then the newspaper
representative appealed to the men, and as they
hadn’t liquored with anybody their complaints
were long and vigorous. And finally the press-
man seems to have been affably entertained by
somebody else, and going away with a com-
fortable sensation in his stomach he wrote two
columns setting forth that all the original
statements seemed to be true, but even if they
were true there was no reason why anybody
should have made a fuss. The temperature of
the stoke-hole was apparently the temperature
of a nether hell; the water didr run short; the
ventilating fans did break down ; sentries were
placed over the exits to prevent the perishing
slop-made wretches who were shovelling coal
below from making their escape into a purer
atmosphere ; and the whole blazing infamy of
the story was apparently true in every parti-
cular but—
If anybody is to blame it is that impersonal and un-
reachable body known as the Admiralty, and as we cannot
touch the Lords, we can do but little good by harping on
the subject.
Which same remark, made in a cheerful strain
by a well-filled man who isn’t thirsty, nor in
want of pure air, nor otherwise in trouble,
would fit equally well the stoke-hole of the
Mildura or the furnace of Gehenna, where
there is also “ little good ” in the lost and fried
soul “ harping on the subject.”
# # #
The following is a slab from the statements of
the men, which are not worth harping upon
The first spokesman, a leading stoker, complained of
the treatment he had received from the doctor two days
after leaving Suez. He had fallen ill, and had consulted
the doctor, who had refused to put him on the sick-list.
He was thoroughly fagged out with the work and heat,
and as an illustration of the effect of the voyage he stated
that he had lost 501 b. in weight since he left England. He
also complained of the sentries being placed on the air-
locks during the hottest part of the passage, and declared
that the stokehole bore a striking resemblance to an
“inferno.” The after stokehole was sometimes red-hot,
and scalding water washed about on the bilge plates.
Men had fainted and had been brought up on deck and
revived with sea-water. He had also been abused by the
chief engineer, and altogether, though he had been five
years at sea, had never known such a time before.
Another leading stoker complained of the abuse which
had been showered upon him. Though he had been
through the Red Sea before, he had never experienced
such heat as in the stokehole of the Mildura. A third
leading stoker stated—“ We were abused like dogs for
not keeping enough steam up.” When the fans broke
down it became exceptionally hot. These complaints
were repeated by most of the men, though sometimes,
during the lengthened inquiry, novel points of a minor
character were brought out. On one occasion the middle
watch at night was kept on duty until half-past 6 in the
morning, instead of until 4 only. This meant two and
a-half hours’ extra work.
That is all! There isn’t anything more ! The
stoke-hole was only red-hot, and the foul water
that washed around was a scalding fluid, and
the general sensation was that of sitting in a
boiling-kettle on top of a stove. The ventila-
ting apparatus had gone to pieces ; there was
an armed individual at the air-holes to prod
back anyone who wanted a breath even of the
burning air from the Red Sea, and a look at
the light of the brassy sky. And it was, in the
Herald s estimation, only a novel point of a
minor character, that the men who had been
shovelling coal for four hours in this demoniac
atmosphere should be compelled, as alleged,
through the blundering of some affable fool in
brass and buttons, to shovel coal for only two
and a-half hours longer. If the S.M. Herald’s
representative had been swinging a huge pair
of Indian clubs in the hottest room of a Turkish
bath for four hours without intermission, and
just when he wanted to crawl out and die,
somebody ordered him, in a perfectly friendly
manner, to stay in and swing the same clubs
for two and a-half hours more, he would pro-
bably understand the situation. That also
wouldn’t be worth harping on—that is to say,
it wouldn’t be worth while for anybody to harp
except the wretch with the fried back and the
baked head, who had been swinging the clubs.
This one item of the story has since been con-
tradicted by Captain Karslake, so the chances
for and against it are about equal, but when
the Herald account was published it was still
an undisputed assertion, and that papers
humane idea about “ points of a minor charac-
ter ” is worth noting.
* * *
Things so far were bad, but a demon of
explanation entered into the captain and the
admiral and made things worse. The admiral
speaks: —
Do you know that on board this vessel, the Orlando,
the average temperature of the stokehole is about 30 -
higher Ilia'll that registered on the Mildura? Only the
other day, on the passage from New Zealand to Sydney,
the thermometer in the stokehole rose to ICO - , and this in
a comparatively cool climate and duiing the wintti
season.
Here the question arises : If the temperature
rises to 160 degrees on board a vessel travelling
in cool latitudes in winter, who can reasonably
believe that it was only 134 in another vessel
travelling at high speed through the hottest
sea on earth ? Had the thermometer broken
down as w ell as the ventilating-fans ? Also,
is even 134 degrees a temperature at which any
individual one shade above a brute can require
any other man to do 6A consecutive hours of
exhausting labour? Further, if the condition
of the Mildura is bad, does it alleviate things
in any way to learn that the Orlando is worse ?
Would Admiral Scott feel inclined to sing
snatches of opera in a hot frying-pan simply
because Gehenna was still hotter i
Further explanations follow :
The ship is supposed to be capable of doing IS knot?,
but the most we ever ran teas 13, a little over hay M prco.
Of course I know our passage was more hurried than mat,
of the other vessels of the squadron. We were a tort-
night late in leaving England through causes over which
1 had no control, and by the orders of the Admiralty this
time had to be made up, in order that all the ships might
arrive in Australia together. I was thus compelled to
keep up speed in going through the Red Sea, whether I
liked it or no, but at no time was the vessel driven at
anything like full speed.
The question whether the captain did or did
not like fast steaming is interesting from an
outside standpoint, but that officer’s extraneous
views had no influence whatever on the tem-
perature in the stokehole. And in any case
a man who is kept working for from four to
six-and-a-half consecutive hours in a murderous
atmosphere cares no more for the captain s
opinions on fast steaming than he does about
the captain’s opinions on infant baptism. He is
in the stoke-hole all the same, and the hidden
sentiments of a man who is enjoying the pure
atmosphere above are of no account. Further,
if the Mildura becomes a floating perdition
when she is toiling along at a poor 13 knots an
hour, what is she likely to be when doing the
whole 18?—and she has been sent here on the
pretence that she can do 18 ? More explanation
ensues on other points :
The story about the sentries with loaded muskets and
fixed bayonets turns out to be rather highly coloured.
“ It is true,” exclaimed the captain, “ that on three or
four occasions a man was told off to watch the exit from
the stoke-hole, and for a very good reason. Constant
complaints were made about the habit which the men had
of bolting up from below, and thus shirking their work
altogether. . . . These sentries were simply men
belonging to the watch on deck, and were not armed at
all. How they came to be equipped with loaded rifles
and fixed bayonets rather puzzles me, and I can assure
you that such a thing was never even dreamt of.” As to
the scarcity of water after leaving Aden, the captain ex-
plains that the consumption had become so extravagant
that it was necessary to place some check on it. The
ship’s corporal was ordered to see that there was no un-
necessary waste; but at the same time everyone was
allowed to have as much as was realty needful.
In other words, the men complain that sentries
were placed to keep them below, and the
captain suavely admits the truth of the
story. The men also say that their water-
supply was short, and the captain blandly
acknowledges that he put them upon an allow-
ance to check “extravagant consumption,” as
that term is understood by a person who has
the run of all the cool liquors in the cabin.
They say the same thing in different ways.
The captain says it in a gay and affable way
because he was on deck, and the men say it
bitterly because they were below. The officer
bears up manfully under the stokers’ affliction,
and the stokers would probably have borne up
as manfully under his affliction if the positions
had been reversed. Also, if the reporter had
been below, and the stokers had been writing
for the S.M. Herald they might also have
thought the matter “ not worth harping upon.”
# * *
A few more details are thrown in here. The
blue-jackets—as the Herald man is careful to
mention—look well, and seeing they were in no
way concerned he might as reasonably have
added, for the purpose of refuting the accusa-
tionsmade, that the Patagonians seemed healthy,
and the Japanese had no complaints to make.
The captain of the Mildura seemed nervous
—why he was nervous isn’t stated. The
Admiral has ordered an enquiry, though why
he did that, seeing that he blandly admits
everything, Heaven only knows. He or his
subordinate also wrote to Sir Samuel Griffith
“ entirely denying the charges,” which seems a
somewhat steep thing to do, considering that
the charges are true by their own showing.
The whole exhibition was an amazing comedy.
The Admiral was in his cabin on the flag-
ship denying everything. The captain was
on deck, looking “nervous.” The S.M.
Herald reporter stalked around reviewing the
men, and taking evidence against the officers.
The stokers were on deck cursing the officers.
The blue jackets tacitly gave the captain a
testimonial as a well-meaning individual who
was hardly ever sick at sea. Then the news-
paper man blandly told the commander that he
was discharged without a stain on his character.
The proceedings ought to have closed by the
crew presenting the Admiral with a testimonial
in his cabin, and having a glass of wine with
him, and stating vocally that he was a jolly
good fellow, but somehow this ceremony was
omitted. Taking it all round it is a joyous
specimen of naval discipline when the fleet
rises up to explain itself to what the naval
Lords would no doubt contemptuously speak of
privately as a twopenny newspaper.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Broking Swindle.
The Brokers Bill, about to be introduced in the
Victorian Assembly, will, if passed, put
£20,000 worth of taxation on to the right
shoulders, and promote a healthy reform among
the gambling-sharks of the Stock Exchange. It
provides, in the first place, that all brokers
shall be licensed, and this arrangement will
exterminate in one act half of the swindlers and
jobbers who haunt the precincts of the ex-
changes. And, secondly, it provides that
every broker must keep an accurate record of
his transactions, and his books must be at all
times open to inspection. And when the
broker is always open to inspection there will
practically be an end of “spec, selling,” and
the borrowing of scrip, and the bogus sales in
which one man, who doesn’t possess a single
share, pretends to trade off 7000 of them in one
line to his confederate at a big advance, and the
confederate passes them on to his accomplice at
another advance, and so an artificial boom
is created when there is nothing to
justify it save a barren mountain-peak—
facetiously called a “mine”—and a lot of
cast-iron lying. For, in the matter of naked
and unadorned fraud, the ordinary broker
passes all comprehension. Often on the Ballarat
“ Corner,” or in the “ Beehive,” at Bendigo,
when nothing is doing and all is utter stagna-
tion, 30 or 40 of these stony perjurers will get
together in a heaving tumultuous mass, and
madly and furiously sell shares to each other by
thousands while the prices go up into a state of
frenzy. The mine dealt with is a dead-beat
hole; the sellers are dead-broke; the buyers
are stumped ; but for hours the crowd howl
and shriek, and tear up paper, and cast it over
each other, and rush into pubs, to drink, and
rush out again and buy more shares —20,000
shares at one shilling—the same shares at
2s. 6d.—the same shares over again at five
shillings —any number of shares at any price
under the sun. Night comes and finds them
still howling and buying the identical shares at
18s. 6d., and by this time the crowd is limp and
covered with perspiration, and its collar is
burst, and its shirt is a damp rag, and its boots
are trodden down at the heels with much leap-
ing and prancing. But in between whiles, some
flat wanders into the circle, and the crowd sells
shares to him in reality, with three days for
delivery, and then when it has caught all the
fiats that seem available it goes softly home to
tea. And next day it is wandering around, and
selling the same old lot of imaginary shares to
itself in a depressed sort of tone at sixpence,
and inside the three days it fills its orders at
waste-paper prices, and absorbs the difference.
Compared to the stock exchange swindle, even
the fan-tan fraud and the totalisator trick are
comparatively honest and harmless. Therefore
the Brokers Bill will doubtless commend itself
to many, and particularly to the godly gentle-
men who conduct operations on Melbourne
’Change, and have the front to inveigh against
gambling in between their other duties.
"
The Testimonial Complaint.
The testimonial-disease has spread even into
the British navy. The other day some news-
paper or other published a number of unkind
statements about the captain and officers
of the alleged man-of-war Tauranga, now upon
the Australian station, and thereupon the
crew rose up as one man, and presented the cap-
tain with a eulogistic document, since communi-
cated —no doubt, with the admiral’s sanction
to the daily press. It was a long and eloquent
publication, and woundup by stating that “ the
relations between the officers and men of Ibis
ship are of the most cordial description.” This
is the beginning of the new order of things.
Ten or twenty years hence every captain will
have a testimonial from his crew written in some
such strain as this
We, the undersigned seamen of H.M.S. Pannikin, hereby
testify that we have found Captain Smith a clean, moral,
and industrious officer, who has done his best to give
satisfaction. During the time he was in our employment
as commander we found him capable, cheerful, and
energetic, and also neat and tidy in his dress, and suave
in general conversation. He is a respectful and pains-
taking person, and under efficient supervision will always
he found useful. He is also always sober until 11 a.m.,
when the crew go ashore for the day, and invariably smokes
on the lee side of the ship, and his religious principles are
unexceptionable. We find it necessary to part witb him,
having made other arrangements, but can confidently
recommend him to any crew that may require his
services.
This is the sort of thing the testimonial business
always ends in. It starts on the assumption
that it is so surprising a British officer should
do his duty, that when he does it lie needs a
howling eulogium from everybody concerned ; it
spreads till the officer who doesn’t get a testi-
monial will presently be a blighted being ; and
it finishes in the apotheosis of drivel. It is like
goats, and drink, and influenza, and Chinamen,
for when once it begins it keeps on growing,
and unless the whole world swears off the thing
must wind up badly.
The servant-girl “cap” question involves the
whole subject of livery. Livery is slavery. A
compulsory uniforn is only necessary in the
cases of certain officers of the peace and
Government and railway officials who, when on
duty, become statutory officers of the peace.
The uniform is necessary then for public con-
venience and enlightenment. A policeman who
lias authority to stop and question a civilian is.
very propexdy required to wear a distinguishing
uniform or to be able to exhibit an official
badge. The same comment applies to customs-
officers, railway-guards, ships’ officers, &c.. &c.
But the livery of a private household is a demo-
cratic abomination and a badge of servitude out
of harmony with a free community. The
gaiters and cockade of a coachman, or the
gorgeous blue and yellow plush of a footman,
make manhood wail for its base counterfeits.
To submit to be compelled to wear the hideous
duds chosen by some rich and vulgar-souled
employer, in order to advertise that employer’s
supposed wealth and alleged social supremacy
over his flunkeys, is to admit that the wearer is
of inferior clay to the man who has purchased
his right to choose his own garments.

There are many strange anomalies in the legal
ring of New South Wales. Nobody is allowed
to practise unless he first passes the matricula-
tion exam, at the University, and then serves
five years under articles to a practising solicitor’.
In all the better class offices the solicitor charges
on an average, say, 200 guineas premium to
each articled clerk ; he pays them no salary or
one that is merely microscopic; and he is
allowed to have tlii’ee articled clei’ks at a time.
Consequently, he makes a steady income of
about 120 guineas per annum ; he gets his work
done gratis ; and the system, if worked for all
it is worth, admits of the whole gang of solici-
tors trebling in numbers evei’y five years.
English and Irish solicitors, and Writers to the
Signet from Scotland, are admitted without
examination, regardless of the fact tha't they
know no more of New South Wales law
than of the code of Timhuctoo. Scotch solici-
tors, who pass exactly the same examination in
Scotland as do the Writers to the Signet, are
not admitted ; they have simply to start life
afresh by going throxxglx the matriculation
exam, and being articled over again. The
cause of this amazing foolishness lias never been
explained, hut the Scotch solicitor pays a small
fee in his own country, and the Scotclx writer a
very large one, and probably the New South
Wales legal profession grovels by instinct to
the man who paid the big fee. Mr. Chick s
Bill, providing that anyone may become a
lawyer so long as he proves on examination
that lie knows law, is an astounding innovation l ,
for many reasons—among others, heeaxise,
under the present system, the solicitor is not
required to prove that lie knows law to any
extent. He lias to know all sorts of other
useless information, hut with the code itself he
has very often only a slight acquaintance. It
is an item that has been forgotten, somehow.

Mv Pear Moorabinua,—
Another large and logged-out army of smartyrs (copy-
right) appeared at Randwick on Oaks Day, but isn’t it
rather a reflection on “ sassiety ” that during the Spring'
Meeting the high places have been much more patronised
than the pit and gallery? Xo wonder the reformers can’t
get a “representative” bell-topper to extinguish the
totalisator under! The Govingment ’Ouse party was
there in all its glory, and I notice that their Excellencies
don't let everybody cavort round the vice-regal enclosure;
instead, there is a formal invitation to enter, when the
invited is never expected to squat on the cane furniture.
Lady Jersey (like hubby, she looks best dressed to death)
wore sap-green silk with a watered pattern in black, and
studded over with small pink flowers. The skirt was
demi-trained at the back over a foundation of spring-
green silk, the front had a deep black lace flounce high at
the sides and narrowing to the middle, caught with bows
of bright green ribbon ; the bodice had a pink silk vest
draped with black lace, and a small black lace and jet
bonnet had a coronet of unmounted blush roses. Lady
Kintore (who must run Bernhardt pretty close in the
matter of luggage) wore a black silk gown covered with
fine black Chantilly lace, trimmed with borders of shot
mauve, silk edged with steel beads ; small black jet and
lace bonnet with a purple flower set in aggressively at the
back, and black lace parasol. Lady Scott in a cornflower-
blue faille over a petticoat of faille edged with gold
braid, the bodice with a vest of 6cru faille veiled in
chiffon, small bonnet with crown of white jasmine. Mrs.
Rupert Carington wore a salmon-pink front and chiffon
frills on her black gown, toque en suite, and Manola cloak
in black and gold braided yoke covering her glory
occasionally. Lady Innes wore a ruby and white-chintz-
patterned gown made en panier and trimmed with ruby
ribbon, velvet and white guipure, small bonnet trimmed
with red currants. Mayoress Manning wore a cool-look-
ing cream delaine figured in heartsease and trimmed with
bows of grey and mauve ribbon, black bonnet lightened
by a fall of gold-dusted black tulle ; Miss Manning had a
bunch of daffodils in her white bodice, and a wide hat
trimmed with wattle and black velvet. Carrie Swain,
in black and steel beads, was the counterpart of Nellie
1 arren in the first scene of “ Ruy Bias ; ” and perhaps the
most correct get-up on the members’ stand was a pale-
grey match even to the Bond-street hat trimmed with
velvet and the little gauntlet gloves—the only colour being
a flesh-pink carnation in the buttonhole and a flesh-pink
parasol.
Craven Plate day at Randwick was an off-day in every
sense but a barometrical one, for the weather was gor-
geous if the worldlings weren’t. There wasn’t a vice-regal
woman anywhere ; for one cause and another the Aus-
tralian Club ball had been kept up the night before till
cockcrow.
Nellie Barren was the attraction on the members’
stand, wearing a black broche frock trimmed with beads,
under a Manola wrap in black velvet with yoke and collar
and edge of gold lines ; toque of black velvet and jet with
touch of red in it. Nellie, by the way, is gotten-up better
than she used to be for out-door use, and walks the lawn
with the same little fussy toddle she wears on the stage.
Another gasping-stock was the wealthy little Melbourne
brunette who shone out at the Australian Club hop,
dontcherknow, and who is worth I don’t know how many
O’a after the first figure of her dot. She wore a yellow
muslin startlingly adorned with cornflowers, and a black
crinoline hat trimmed with those simple flowers of the
field en suite. Miss Dight wore cream muslin with a
yellow spot, trimmed with airy yellow chiffon ; dead white
hat with yellow flowers. Miss Cox was in cream muslin
with satin ribbons and cream and yellow hat. Miss Fos-
bery’s neat chow costume in lilac gingham looked good
style, but a little dollish woman was fancy-fair-ish in a
grey satin trimmed with silver-spangled tulle ; a maiden
in a white jacket with a nosegay in her collar suggested
that she was Queen of the May, mother ; but the queerest
figure there had its hair short, spectacles and sailor hat
a rigid frock in fawn tweed made with a dicky front, race
glasses strapped across, and a man’s umbrella ! But the
funniest thing about it was that it behaved so decorously
that it might have been its own maiden aunt all the time.
This Spring A.J.C. Meeting was a very hilarious out-
break, and it died game with the biggest attendance of
all on the last (Steeplechase) day. There wasn’t any
vice-regal pivot (one doesn’t count the “ suite ”)and it’s
astonishinghow smoothly things went off even with desola-
tion in the vice-regal box. The music was very good and
lured people to promenade and show off their wearing
apparel. Miss Buckley (Melbourne) had on a very com-
plete turn-out in mauve silk with a circle design in white
trimmed with guipure embroidery, white chiffon ruffles,
toque of green velvet bows, and wreath of Russian violets;
her parasol of the same stuff as her frock. Miss Gowland
embodied the aphorism of “beauty unadorned ” in white
muslin sprigged over with little grey flowers and tied
round with a simple white sash ; a handsome frock was in
sage-green, the cuirass drapery of closely woven flesh-pink
lace studded with “ rubies; ” a heliotrope with the top part
made like a frock-coat, the collars lined with white silk,
was an ugly novelty. Miss Hack (South Australia) had
a pretty frock of pinkish muslin with a deep lace basque,
her leaf-straw hat trimmed with pink and touches of sage
green. This fair damsel, who sings like a syren, is
affianced—did 1 tell you?—to the tall Dr. Alaster Cox.
Mrs. (Colonel) Mackenzie in cobweb grey, in a grey bonnet
sunning o’er with buttercups ; Miss Ada Fosbery in pink
had a three-cornered hat in black, trimmed with little
white flowers, her “ chum’’—Miss Nellie Hill—in straw-
berry tweed with rough white lines trimmed with gold ;
smart little bonnet in green velvet, gold tinsel and what’s-
o’-clocks. There were several coaches on the last d»v_
Mr. Terry's spick and span bays taking the polish off the
other four-in-hands, even to the women on the roof.
The vice-regal garden-party on ICthinst. was a crowded
and successful affair, even though the weather was rather
too uncertain for a. fete champetre. Yet everybody turned
out in “ ribbons gay ” and was received by Lord and Lady
Jersey, and the bonny (of course the printer will make it
“the bony”) Kintore and brother Rupert No. 1, who all
stood on the steps of the piazza and welcomed the com-
pany in a sort of how-d'ye-do-de-quatre - a port-wine
magnolia tree close by shedding a sweet perfume over the
ceremonies. The “ goodies,” for which the usual hungry
rush was made, were set out in the covered-in verandah,
and a band jerked Sullivanisms most of the time while
the guests (who had been meeting one another and making
talk day and night for the past week) tried to look as if
they had something fresh to say and were delighted with
the chance. As for the garments, lots of soothers came
in at the garden-gate. Lady J. was rather haphazard in
a lilac frock with darker lines and a coral pattern over it
in white, cuffs and front of Maltese lace and mauve
velvet, mauve gloves and a rather scrunehed-looking
bouquet, which, of course, didn’t harmonise-—presenta-
tion bouquets never do. Lady Barley sat on the piazza
all the time, keeping her black and gold bonnet out of
the wet, presumably ; Lady Innes wore a charming dress
of green Bengaline embroidered at the border and trimmed
with black ribbon velvet and gold gimp, black ostrich boa
and small black jet bonnet. The Mayoress wore snow-
flake tweed combined w ith electric-blue ; Mrs. (Dr.)Twy-
nam was in electric-blue silk covered with black-figured
grenadine; Miss Dight was artistic in pink tweed with a
brown silk vest and red currants in her hat; Miss Gow-
land, in china-blue dotted woollen trimmed with blue
Bengaline and gold gimp, looked really nice. Talking
w’as the amusement, and one heard the low murmur of
culchaw on every hand. For instance, one gentleman
socially remarked to a lady as the crowd surged some-
what: “ I hope you left your corns at home, Mrs. Dash.”
Talking about the garden • party, it was very
amusing to see a popular vice-regal visiting secretary
sneaking cautiously into Government House by the back
way in very Pickwickian clothing (faded tweed with a
little bit of braid off, the sort of thing one’s big brother
goes a-flshing in), but emerging from the front door a
few minutes later in all the glories of pot-hat and red car-
nation ! How he must envy the lightning-change artist
who can do a little juggle like that in full view of the
audience!
Mayoress Manning’s “at home ” (dancing), held in the
vestibule of the Town Hall on 17th inst., was quite a suc-
cessful festivity attended by lots of pretty women in neat
frockings, which, with the garlands of evergreen, palm-
leaves and festoons of terra-cotta silk on the walls, made
up into a rather gay picture. The Mayoress (who enjoys
the polka) wore a bodice and train of Francisca-coloured
brocade with jupe of cream moire with flounces at waist
and hem of cream lace; sleevelets and folds of cream
chiffon held by a diamond clasp ; the prettiest turn-out
was of dead-white silk and lace, the front flounce studded
with little white flowers, a large posy of exquisite
daffodils the only colour. Miss M. Windeyer wore a
white silk gown trimmed with white ostrich-feathers.
Miss Marks’ white satin was trimmed with silver
gimp, lace and trails of honeysuckle. A very pretty
pompadour brocade (blue, with design in pink)
the corselet bodice finished with folds of pink and
blue crepe, was economically cut above the waist-line, and
rather spoilt as a turn-out by a “stage” diamond neck-
lace ; Mrs. T, Slattery’s gown was an artistic juggle of
yellow brocade, old gold velvet, old guipure and un-
dressed ostrich feathers, of which her fan was composed ;
a very pretty girl was dowdy in a pinky-yellow frock ;
Miss Halliday in salmon-pink silk, gold gimp and chiffon ;
and a doctor’s pretty wife in an art costume of cream
brocade, wore her skirts quite an inch too short frontally,
which rather spoilt her ensemble in the square dances,
you know. I did not remain until supper, which, I am
told, was a dazzling achievement in keeping with the floor
and music (piano and fiddlers three) which were quite
tip-top.
The very latest Potts Point way to treat your kiss-curls
is not to curl them at all, but to have them combed out
straight and scanty in a powdered line across your baby-
brow. This has probably come in because hot irons and
damp "pins” have made the hair come out, and I hear
the correct way to fix it is with a small tooth-comb—the
teeth of which instrument it very much resembleth, by
the way.
The second Spring ball at Sydney Government House
on ISth inst. consisted of the usual equal number of men
and women, flowers, floor, food and fiddling, and people
must sometimes long to be invited to walk on then-
hands to the tune of tom-toms with a bread-and-water
buffet just for a blessed change. With a half-concealed
caligraphic yawn (your Sappho has been stifled with a rag
fair for the last fortnight) 1 inform a listening hemisphere
that the titled hostess on this occasion appeared smiling
in yellow faille enriched with beaded relievements,
diamond suite ; the South Australian social guardian-
angel wearing mauve-blue brocade softened with chiffon ;
diamond jewels. Sixteen dances—including a schottische
—were elasticised by extras. And, talking of dancing,
the long, loping, languorous waltz has quite gone out
among the beacon-lights of sassiety, who now take jig-
steps to time. Also polkas, in which the dancers hop as
high as Hainan, have a big say at present on the “ toney’>
dance-card.
The two swell Sydney club balls took place last week,
the Australian leading on 16th inst. in the Centennial
Hall. Imagine hysterics over the greenery and the
gobbling, which were both an’artist’s inspiration—especi-
ally the little encampment of tents surrounded by
shrubs in the vestibule wherein the parted partners
found rendezvous all the evening. Lord and Lady
Kintore and Sir Precedent Scott were the dais deities on
this occasion. The Union Club held their annual hop on
18th inst., and great was the success thereof. Lord and
Lady Jersey were both on the floor and couldn’t tear
themselves away until 12.30, so nearly everybody saw
the programme through, determined to enjoy, to the
final bar, the last big festivity of the gay and festive race-
week.
A drawing-room wedding had Miss Mary MTlvvraith—
second daughter of Sir Thomas M'llwraith, of “ Auchen-
flower,” Queensland, to Mr, Montague Talbot Stanley,
eldest son of Mr. F. D. G. Stanley, Toowong, Queensland,
on 9th inst. The wedding was, as weddings should be, a
very quiet one, only old friends and relatives being pre-
sent, and the bride wore white brocade trimmed with
cord and chiffon, and a'.very choice posy. The two maids
(Misses MTlwraith and Stanley) in white book muslin and
Valenciennes lace. Sydney honeymoon, the bride setting
out upon it in grey crepe cloth embroidered in silver.
An historically interesting match was made at Sutton
Forest on 9th inst. (when Miss Kate Nicholson, daughter
of Mr. C. L. Nicholson, of “ Newbury,” Sutton Forest,
was married to Mr. Fred. N. Oxley, late of “Kirkham,”
Camden), since the grandfathers of both parties came to
Australia long ago as naval officers, the bridegroom’s
grandpa being a rather adventurous explorer and first
Surveyor-General of N.S.W. Mrs. Oxley will reside at
Oxford, where her husband is Resident Engineer.
Sydney Liedertafel shriek, on 15th instant, was a calm
and peaceful way of spending the evening of the Metrop.
Day—the Holy Supper of the Apostles” (by Wagner)
falling- like dew upon the levered tympanums of peop’e
deafened by the loud odds of the paddock. However,
some of the slippering: apostles sang as if bellowing a
rival down was their object, too, and whether it is that
we aren’t soulful enough, or the “apostles ” miss fire at
critical moments—when St. John reaches across Peter for
the butter as it were, or St. Matthew puts his knife in his
mouth, in a manner of speaking—remains to be fought
out by the critics. Miss Lalla Miranda, a Victorian
songstress, who has greatly improved since she debutted
with Patey, in Melbourne, last November—was loudly
encored for her numbers, but her selection of “ Auld
Robin Gray ” was unwise, since that pathetic illustration
of matrimonial expediency (nobody ever wastes any
emotion over Robin, I notice) is altogether unsuited for a
soprano voice.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

Business with the Gaiety Co. suffered a
slight drop during the middle of the week, though
nothing to that experienced at other houses, but
the theatrical mercury has since risen to “ set
fair,” and seems likely to remain there. Meyer
Lutz’s arrangement of “The Bogie Man,”' 0 f
which we heard so much during last pantomime
season, does not seem an improvement on the
American setting, and Leslie’s method in it
does not compare favourably with that of little
Ayrton at the other Imperially-named house.
I lorence Levey fell down half-a-dozen stairs the
other night at the feet of her Danby, who had no
appropriate gag ready for the unexpected
declension. Subjects of general comment are the
realistic hue of Nellie Barren’s flesh-tights in the
crossing-sweep act, and the admiring glances that
a certain shapely, pink-limbed damsel, apparently
“shook on her own shape,”continuously throws
down on herself. Perhaps, however, it’s modesty—
she may be abashed by the steady glare of the bald-
heads’ row. Some of the gags, particularly those
built up on the names of the performers, get more
and more wire-drawn as the nights spin out, and
the small talk of the chorus up-stage, when the
alleged bull-tight is on outside the wings, is abtmt
the poorest attempt at description in this line ever
known. Folks do not seem particularly gone on
any of the Gaiety songs ; some are not new, ail
are vulgar. Anything more inane than “Just
had a wire to say so ” and “Wink the other eye ”
can scarcely be imagined. But, truth to tell, even
the most unrefined' Cockney alleged witticisms
seem to go down without greasing even in the
circle. Leslie freely describes certain dance steps
as “rotten,” and alludes to objects of dislike as
“rotters.” By the way. Leslie might get a lot
more fun out of his dual Scotch - Irishman.
“ Cinder-Ellen ” is promised on Monday, Oct. 5.

“ The Village Priest ” is one long
appeal to the mystic from draw-up to riug°-
down ; but religion always provides its consola-
tions, the good Abbe never sends round the col-
lection-plate. That’s where Grundy and nature
part company. According to report the writer
took the idea from Busnach and Canvin’s “ Le
Secret de la Teneuse,” but remodelled, did not
adapt, the drama. Anyhow, the play finds its
cause in the wicked work of Judge d’Arey who,
after the fashion of his successors, intrigued with
the Comtesse de Tremeillan, and, fearing dis-
covery, shot her husband and his friend, while in
his judicial capacity sentencing an innocent game-
keeper, Torquienie, to prison for the murder.
Then he goes home to die of apoplexy after con-
fessing his guilt to the Abbe, and the play begins
with the betrothal of the Judge’s son, Armand,
to the daughter of his father’s mistress. Then
the gamekeeper escapes and confides his story to
Armand, who, in his researches, discovers his
father’s guilt and the secret of his prospective
mother-in-law. The good Abbe, troubled for
years over the incarceration of the innocent,
finds fresh cause for mental trouble in the
now broken-off engagement of the young folks
and the repulse of the escapee by his daughter,
who has been cared for since childhood by the
Judge’s widow. The moonlight falling through
the cloister window on his open Bible and an
appropriate text decides him, and he reveals the
secret of the confessional. The innocent criminal,
however, fearing to wound the woman who had
succoured his child, refuses to be cleared, and goes
back to gaol with the guilt of her husband still
attached to his name. So the story is completed
in a style that upsets all the traditions of the
playwrights’art. Everything is incomplete. The
guilty woman continues to repent her sin and
bewail its consequences ; her daughter is still
kept apart from the now wretched son of
the wicked Judge, and the gamekeeper’s
daughter is left to bewail her innocent father’s
cruel fate. In fact, the only comfortable creature
is the Judge’s widow, full of belief in her late
husband’s goodness. The sombreness of this play
is not lit up by one touch of comedy. It contains
more woe and desolation to the act than even
Pinero’s wearisome effort to be serious in “The
Profligate.” Chas. Cartwright’s Abbe looks more
like an Irish than a French priest, but he suc-
ceeds admirably in holding his audience while he
ladles out long sermons, ably penned, but invari-
ably wearying and depressing. Olga Nethersole,
for the first time in her Sydney experience,
handles a middle-aged woman. Her make-up is,
however, decidedly youthful, and the powder
flying from her hair in tragic moments caused
folks on the stage to sneeze and those off to grin.
Her best chance occurs at the end of the third
act, and here, on first night, the little lady was
so overwrought that she became hysterical and
couldn’t respond to a thundering call from a
crowded house. Cautley’s escapee is well played,
but disfigured by the convulsive jerks, like those
of a wire-impelled marionette, with which he
draws his legs after him. Cosgrove is marring his
chances by picking up the peculiarities of those
with whom he is associated. All the other
people, especially Mary Kingsley, are acceptable.
“Moths” will be played for Miss Nethersole’s
benefit to-night (Thursday), and the Darrells, as
previously announced, open on Saturday in “ The
Sundowner.” Owing to the indisposition of Miss
Nethersole, the Cartwright combination will pass
the days that precede their Melbourne season at
the Mountains, instead of in a Brisbane theatre.

“Led Astray” does not seem to have
revived the languid business lately prevailing at
Sydney Criterion. Yet the play is magnifi-
cently staged and costumed, and excellently
played. It is one of those Boucicaultian
dramas that remind one of Lever’s novels,
abounding, as they do in Irish squires and
captains, French nobles, and adventurers of both
sexes. This play deals, however, chiefly with the
dangers that environ a wife whose husband ima-
gines that the protection of his name and the
use of his banking-account ought sufficiently
to satisfy all requirements. The temptation
comes in the person of a lovely young poet,
George de Lesparre, ably played by Percy Lyndal,
who is roaming the earth in search of his affinity
and who finds it in the person of the Baroness
Ohandoce (Mrs. Brough), the second wife of a gay
sportsman (George Titheradge), the father of an
innocent and sweet young girl, nicely played by
Miss Spong. The lady, however, is not so much
“led astray ” as is the punctilious husband who,
believing that what is merely folly in the man is
absolute crime in the woman, finds her guilty of
some undefined offence, against the evidence of
his senses. The couple are at length re-
united through the efforts of the little daughter
and her fiancee, a good-natured busy-body,
cleverly played by Dot Boucicault. George
Titheradge’s is the performance; the comedy, of
which Dot Boucicault is the backbone, is received
with shrieks of laughter, and Mrs. Brough is quite
equal to the calls made on her capacity for pour-
traying emotion. Edward Sass, as the fire-eating
Irish swindler, is a bit uncertain in tongue,
and Louise Davenport makes her re-appearance
as his accomplice, after a long absence
from the Sydney stage. Other gaps are ably
filled by Annie Taylor, Constance Deorwyn and
Mr. Chichester, but one or two characters like
that of the faithful retainer might be advan-
tageously eliminated.

“ A Celebrated Case ” was put up by that
celebrated actress, Laura Villiers, and her cele-
brated Co., at Sydney Her Majesty’s, on Saturday
night last, before an attenuated house. So far it
does not seem likely that this concatenation of
celebrity is likely to hit Sydney folks harder than
it did those in Melbourne. The play, run here by
Bandmann as “Proof,” we fancy, is not particu-
larly strong, and the manner in which Miss
Villiers, the murdered wife of the first act,
becomes her sorrowing daughter in the second,
proved somewhat bewildering to an easily-
muddled Saturday night public. The lady
“ star ” knows all the tricks of the trade
but seems to lack power and definiteness; her
death-scene in the prologue, artistically managed,
was her best effort. The leading man, Clifton
Anderson, with a fine voice and good presence, is
often inaudible and usually stagey, and the sup-
port generally is not of a character that would
entitle it to demand, or receive, first-class passage-
money, out and home, from any Australian
manager. Indeed, so far as we have been per-
mitted to judge, “Poverty Point” and Mac-
quarie-street South reek of more experienced and
capable performers. It is little wonder that the
old-time mummer growls at the importation of
“ talent.” On opening night the best performance
was that of Geo. P. Carey, an old identity, as the
typical, low-comedy stage-irishman, one of the
sort that Boucicault used to wedge in everywhere.
“ A Celebrated Case ” is said to be by “ Cazaran,”
but the whereabouts or status of that individual
and his motive for writing or adapting “ A Cele-
brated Case.” have not as yet come under our
notice.
“The Democrat,” a new and original
drama by Edward Duggan, produced at Sydney
Standard last Saturday night, fizzled out after a
disastrous season of one consecutiveevening, despite
the fact that Frank Cates, as “ a gambler-roue,”
was starred on the bills in conjunction with the
Eureka Stockade, the defence and capture of
which historic enclosure provided the central sen-
sation. On Monday night, prior to returning the
money, the author came before the curtain, and,
thanking those present (about 100) for their sup-
port, informed them that his play had been pro-
mised the support of the Trades and Labour
Council and Socialists’ League. Then embracing
the house with a comprehensive swoop of his arm,
he asked bitterly : “ Where are they?” To which
query a raucous voice from the wings replied
sorrowfully : “ Thirty-five is paid.”

Alf. Wyburd's Bondi Aquarium has risen
again from the ashes and sludge and combusted
fish which were the sole remains of the old-time
structure, and is to be re-opened on sth October.
Thirty-five new artists, including the famous Faust
Family, will prevade the festive scene; there will
be new water, new tanks, new fish, and a new
insurance policy, but there won’t be a new
Wyburd because Nature made only one, and has
never yet got her second wind after the effort.
The wild tinned salmon, the octopus, the shark,
and the pale and reserved salt herring will be on
the job, and there will be two orchestras and
refreshments, and all the other things which tend
to keep man up in this vale of tears.

Sydney Sunday shows continue to fill up
what would otherwise be to many estimable citi-
zens a howling blank in the day of rest. The
Alathea sails out with Arthur Gordon’s Sunday
concert parties twice a day; promenade concerts
are given in the Darlinghurst Rink under the
management of Alderman “Jimmy” Rainford;
Frank Smith gives afternoon performances at
Botany, Sunday night shows at the Alhambra,
and Standard Theatre concerts take place under
fhe patronage of the Trades and Labour Council.

At the Cyclorama, thousands attend
weekly to hang entranced with wobbling eyeballs

The musical public of Melbourne continue
to support Italian opera largely and vociferously
to the extent of a shilling a time, whilst business
in the dress-circle and stalls is solid on Cuttica
nights. The Signora of that ilk is now generally
recognised as the trump-card of the pack, and,
when she and her husband are both doing their
level best to prove that the voice is mightier than
the big drum it is indeed well to be there.
“Lucia” was summoned to the rescue of the
treasury twice, instead of once, during last week,
and any further returns of the same complaint
would be borne with cheerful resignation. The
entire musical performance of that opera is so
good that the finger of scorn almost refuses to
waggle itself at Robert Kennedy’s absurd legs,
and the apathetic glare with which the chorus
regard events of great pith and moment can be
partially forgiven. Operatic choruses are mere
musical automata all the world over - . Flourish a
baton at the figures and notes will issue from their
slots. Otherwise they come, stand around, and
depart like lost sheep who have erred and strayed
from the waxworks. “ Rigoletto,” produced under
a lowering sky on Saturday night, was another
fine burst of harmony that elicited thunders of
applause, relieved by bitter reflections on the
scenery and accessories. Melossi sings and acts
like an artist in the name-part. There are no
Hies on this notable baritone performance, and
though the jester himself has the hump, he never
gives it to his audience. Signora Cuttica delighted
everyone with her Gilda; also the Dook (Signor
C.) contrived to warble, with a bad cold, consider-
ably sweeter than any ordinary nobleman whose
tubes are in fair working order. For the rest,
there was a grating sound about Cavalleri’s con-
tralto, which chips in for the famous quartet in
the last act, but Travaglini, as the murderous
carver of Gilda, and sundry minor vocalists, were
fully worthy of their shares in the occasion,
“Rigoletto” will certainly give a big lift to the
Alexandra fortunes, and should be good for seven
or eight nights in all. For Wednesday and
Thursday (to-night) the bill is “ Norma,” with the
other company at work. Guidotti, unfortunately,
is still on the sick-list, but is expected to be able
to replace her locum-tenens, Madame Boema, next
week.

Immortal Shakespeare was welcomed in a
worthy style at Melbourne Royal on Saturday.
The “wholesome fun” of three centuries ago is
not quite what it used to be, neither do the puns
of the Elizabethan era strike one nowadays as
they struck the Virgin Queen who probably heard
them for the first time, and thought them more
diverting than execution. Nevertheless there is
a cheery ring about “ The Merry Wives _of
Windsor,” and the spectacle of a fat man being
smothered in the soiled underclothing possesses
an enduring charm. That the old farcical
comedy, with its dainty, fantastical finale, will
boom here as it boomed erstwhile in Sydney is
more than possible. Coming after a desolated
season of melodrama, it seemed to bring sunshine
back to the well-beloved house on Saturday, and
the receptions given to the Rignolds and Miss
Kate Bishop were full of promise. The pic-
torial success of the entertainment was undeniable.
Preconceived notions of Falstaff, Ford, his fair
mistress, and a few other people are realised as
the characters come forward. If they interest on
account of their Shakespearian associations rather
than amuse with their mediaeval business and
harmless horseplay, the author is alone to blame.
And nobody dreams of blaming that defunct
Divinity for fear of being hanged, drawn and
quartered, by order of the societies that manu-
facture “papers” to his memory. William
Rignold’s fat knight naturally took chief acting
honours, with Kate Bishop and brother George a
couple of lengths in the rear, Frank Harcourt,
Stirling White, Jewett, Tolano, and Miss Watts-
Phillips put in good efforts whenever they found
an opening, but the representatives of Nym and
Pistol seemed to run a bit wild, and Simple—
handicapped with an idiotic part—cut up inglori-
ously. Dame Quickly, too, would shine better if
she forgot to rub her hands together just every
now and then. Some of the Sydney scenery is
small for the present stage, but the Windsor Park
setting fetched a full round of applause.
** * *
“Jane” goes on lying like the average
prospectus at Melbourne Bijou, where the nightly
attendance is good enough for the management to
rest contented with for another week at least.
“Jane” has no difficulty in mopping up the tear-
drop that starts from every “Hook and Eye”
performance. The transparent skin of Eille Nor-
wood’s comedietta is so thin as to expose the
mechanism inside, and one can see his dreadful
little jokes being worked up to a distressing
climax. Eille’s sense of humour is indicated by
the fact that he plays the hero of this one-act
atrocity, and figures as the victim of an innocent
deception which no sane virgin would dare to
practise upon a new-born babe, lest it might
avenge the insult by giving her a good hard knock
with the feeding-bottle. However, Eille, to do
him justice, evidently entertains some suspicion
that he is making an object of himself, and the
restraint he puts upon his abandon is exceedingly
strong. “Hook and Eye” has one redeeming
point, all the same. It is better than “ Twenty
Minutes Under an Umbrella.”
** * *
At the Princess’ a strong reaction has set
in, after about fourteen weeks of uninterrupted
prosperity. Weaker shows than “The Late
Lamented ” have fattened on a generous public
ere now, yet they seem to avoid this moral story
of bigamy and ’ jungle-cramps with unnecessary
unanimity. The tout ensemble has improved many
degrees since the opening night, especially in the
direction of Maggie Moore and Snazelle, and in
spite of its mosaic-work bizarreness the perform-
ance is enjoyable. Amongst several jokes not
fully appreciated is Snazelle’s attack of jungle-
cramps, intended as a travestie of the collywobbles
which disturbed poor H. M. Stanley’s interior on
the wedding morning, and put a mustard-plaster,
as it were, upon that hardened nigger-slayer’s
honeymoon felicity. “The Lamented” having
missed the financial mark, it is announced to be
withdrawn next Saturday in favour of “Kindred
Souls,” a genteel variety entertainment quite out
of place at the Princess’.

The halls, &c., are ringing the changes on
their “fresh attractions” with solemn persistency,
and General Booth has begun a season to over-
flowing houses at the Exhibition, where people
can enter free and pay when they feel disposed.
Olympia, a new hall in Flinders-street, will be
formally opened next Saturday with an Inter-
national Beauty Show. A number of local Venuses
are being tinted up for the occasion, and if the
shilling-fee includes a squeeze all round, this
novelty ought to clutch on pretty considerable.

The Gaiety Company noted a falling-off in
the supply of social diversions during their second
visit to Melbourne. A leading member of the
talent remarks that they didn’t ’ave nearly so
many h'outings as before.
At Poverty Point.
An American paper spends about half a column of
space over Dora Wiley, “ the sweet singer of Maine,” and
tells a thrilling yarn about her success in Australia. The
present writer remembers that success. In was one
Monday night in Sydney Gaiety. The orchestra was on
strike ; so was the chorus, but at last the piano and the
French horn relented, and the four ugliest chorus-girls
were squared, and the opera commenced 45 minutes late.
The four aged chorus-girls tried to form two tableaux of
three each and failed, and they nearly danced their legs
off, while George Dean —if we remember rightly—as an
Italian monarch, tried to rally up the other performers
behind the scenes. Just as the chorus was about to faint,
Mr. Dean came on regretfully, and announced that the
show was burst. Miss Dora Wiley was doing six simul-
taneous hysterics and one faint in the dressing-room.
Manager Grant got up and fled when he saw the audience
coming to claim their money back ; he had used the
scanty takings to square the three aged chorus-girls, and
get the performance started, and \\ hen the mob bore down
on him he wisely sprinted round the corner. Then the
audience started to knock the end out of the theatre, but
Larry Foley came up and fought the whole crowd single-
handed in the vestibule, and cleared them out. That was
the only successful night the Dora Wiley opera company
had in Sydney, and that laclj—who was the worst failure
in the show—seems to have travelled on the “ ad.” ever
since.
Professor Marshall Hall is to deliver an oration at the

Manager Raynham, of the Gaiety Company, has give ll

Last week’s show business in Melbourne was about the
worst recorded for many a year. With the Opera House
closed, there were beggarly attendances at the Royal
(also shut up on Friday), yards of bare benches at the
Princess’ and Alexandra, and generally plenty of seats
vacant for “Jane,” at the Bijou.
That Patti can now earn £lOOO per night at concert
singing—four times the price she commanded when her
voice was in its prime—is almost incredible. Patti, after
all, was never so phenomenal as a vocalist pure and
simple, her value lay rather in the combination of three
exceptionally attractive qualifications —voice, appearance
and acting-ability—for playing operatic heroines. Twenty
years ago there was little or nothing to choose between
the ballad-singing of Albani, Patti and Nilsson, and it is
certain that the diva’s voice has dropped a note or two
since then. But Patti remained young whilst her former
rivals grew old, and left no one else to dispute her
supremacy and cut up the trade. The woman is a
gigantic monopoly. She has made a “ corner ”of herself,
and sells only small parcels of sweet sounds at famine
prices.

Cause celebre coming in Melbourne by a “toff” against

Apropos of Hopetoun’s no beard. When Harwood
returned from England he addressed a big house at the

The premiere, or first night, is usually the grand one
with a piece, but the Gaiety troupe introduces a system
of last nights, far outdoing the premiere. This begun in
London, with the send-offs to Australia, and the farewell
night, at Melbourne Princess’s was of the same kidney,
whether cunningly lashed up by the management,
deponent sayeth not. However, it was quite a glorified
music-hall show, with free conversation over the foot-
lights, and response to songs called for by the gallery.
Scene-painter Brunton has cut off his long and flowing

It is related that ere the much-mashed Kate Castleton
had been in ’Frisco ten days she made a big sensation in
front of the theatre some time after the show. A gentle-
man was about to enter a coupC in which Kate Castleton
sat. A lady emerged from a doorway and, seizing him by
the coat, said, in a low, strained voice, “ Pet, don’t you
think you had better come home?” “Your husband,
madam?” asked the singer, politely. “Yes.” The lady
said rather more than that, but it is not necessary to
repeat what she said. The singer smiled. “Do take him
away, please. He is a dreadful bore. 1 only let him see
me home because he said he would blow his brains out if
1 did not.”

When John Sheol Sullivan, the eminent actor, was
travelling overland to Adelaide, at one of the stations an
unassuming stranger entered his carriage. “’Ere,” said
John, “this blank carriage is reserved.” “Is it?” said
the stranger—" well, I’m coming in, anyway.” “ Are
you?” observed John—and a few seconds later the new-
comer's portmanteau went flying through the window.
John L. Sullivan brings bad luck. When the company
were leaving Adelaide railway-station on Wednesday last
week an argument arose about the return-tickets, and the
train left without Holloway, Ireland, and Miss Deorwyn.

Geo. Rignold puts an absurd clause in the Melbourne
playbills, virtually expressive of his condescension in
acting Ford, of the “Merry Wives',” but the part was

great feature of it.
An enthusiastic correspondent of the London Tablet

There is no semblance of humour about the
very Christian female. There is very little
humour about the very Christian male
either for that matter, and the Christian
teetotaller, male or female, in all his or her
varieties, is as solemn as a crucified mule. The
following gaudy assertion, made by a woman at
the hen-convention show —alias the New South
Wales Women’s Christian Temperance Union—
the other day, is a case in point:
“ You see,” said the speaker, “ Moses stood in the same
relation to the Israelites as Sir Henry Parkes does to us.”
We have been looking up a few points about
Moses to see where the resemblance comes in,
and we find that eminent Hebrew was more
like Parkes than we used to imagine. He took
the Israelites out into the wilderness, and walked
them off their ancient Hebrew legs for 40 weaxy
years, in the effort to reach a place that any smart
pedestrian could have got to in 60 hours ; and
with all this walking he never arrived there
after all. He left his one and only
job unfinished, Parkes leaves all his
jobs unfinished, too, and he will cheer-
fully trot the Woman’s Suffrage League off
its limbs, and never get anywhere in just the
same faslxion. Moses broke all the command-
ments at once, which may or may not be
another case in point. The old Jew of the
Ax-abian desert is buried in an unknown
sepulchre, and no one knows where he lies ; in
other words, he hadn’t any Dead House ; and
Parkes also has lost his Dead House, in conse-
quence of which no one is likely to know
where he lies either. He was 120 years of age,
and had done no particular good for the last 40
years, and Parkes says he will live to be 120
also, and he never did any good at all. When
the Israelitish chief pegged out on Mount
Pisgah “ his eye,” saith Holy Writ,
“ was not dim nor his natural force
abated,” and probably the Women’s Tem-
perance Convention admires Parkes for
one of these reasons. Also Moses fixed up
twelve huge curses which were fired off on
Mount Ebal, and though Parkes curses on
level ground now by reason of his damaged leg,
which prevents him getting up to any great
elevation, yet for vigorous and original
anathema he is all there. Consequently, if the
Women’s Convention x-eally wants a Moses, it
might do worse than give the job to Parkes.
It seems probable that Balamaceda has
suicided, and cremated himself secretly.
Brewer Toohey, M.P. (N.S.W.), says he is
“prepared to vote for complete prohibition of
liquor-selling,” if such an achievement could be
attained, but he “ knows it is impossible.” It is
Golconda to a mousetrap that he’ll continue
“ knowing its impossibility ” till he becomes the
cynosure of a first-class wake.
The steel suspension-bridge being built by
the North Sydney Tramway and Investment
Co. to connect North Sydney to Willoughby will
stand 180 ft. above water-level, and is the third
largest of its kind in the world. At a dinner to
celebrate the swinging of the first cable, Mr. J.
R. Carey said he would be prepared to put down
£50,000 towards building a bridge between Sydney
and North Shore.
A N.S.W. country paper regrets to be
compelled to inform its readers that “our
esteemed friend and subscriber of many years
standing, Mr. , J.P., while engaged in
the performance of his farm-duties was severely
bitten on the hand by a breeding sow.” Then it
goes on to relate the nature of the wound, the
number of the stitches put in by “our respected
and talented friend, Dr. ,” and the style of
poultice used by the sufferer. What joy.!

General Booth says his father was specu-

General Booth is that he is speculative, acquisitive

It is whispered that in fixing up the late
Minister Sutherland’s (N.S.W.) “effects ” certain
dishonoured documents of monetary import to an
exalted Australian politician were found amongst
the papers. The point of the matter is that
£3OOO was voted to Minister Sutherland’s widow
by N.S.W. Parliament.
Mr. Dwyer Gray, chief proprietor of
Dublin Freeman’s Journal, is but a little over 21
years, and seemed a very sawney youth when in
Australia a year or so ago. On his reasons for
turning his journal against Parnell, some light
may be thrown by the fact that his mother is a
devout Catholic and is likely to enter a convent.
Miss Annie Barker, once widely-known as
“The Lady Stockbroker,” died in Melbourne
Hospital, the other day, aged 05. Unluckily she
succeeded to a legacy, 20 years ago, and went in
heavily for speculation on Melbourne mining-
exchange. At first she made a little pile, but
afterwards she lost all, and descended to a stall
in the Eastern Market, where she failed to hold
her own.
“Jawbone” Neild is introducing a Bill,
in the N.SAV . Assembly, for the Suppression of
V ice. This sort of thing makes us reflect on the
differences between different kinds of people, and
on the fact that some of them are a lot more
modest than others. It is true we don’t think
much of other people, but then we don't think
anything of ourselves. If we took it into our
head to suppress vice, we would begin by sawing
our own larynx. Go thou and do likewise.
Sir John Hay caused a little consternation

chair ; and this slumber apparently seemed to be
a last sleep to the professional eye, for at one
time Dr. Bowker, and at another time Dr. Creed,
approached the septuagenarian to see if medical
aid were needed ; but Sir John awoke from his
slumber ; and the apprehensions of the members
were allayed. He has presided over the Council
since 1873.
Sir Henry Wrenfordsley left W.A. to
accept more money in Fiji, but as he took the
part of the weaker side in the row between the
planters and the natives, he was soon got rid of.
He next got a brief billet in Tasmania, followed
by a second one in Victoria; then he “otium'd”
for a spell, until ho contrived to be called by
(xovernor Robinson to return to W.A. as Acting-
Chief Justice. And now he is off to the land of
Yellow Jack —as Chief Justice of the West Indies
at £l5OO a year.
Charles Rasp was six years ago a boundary
rider over the country containing the great Broken
Hill Proprietary Mine, at a salary of “ thirty bob”
a week. He now receives in round figures about
£50,000 per annum, and, so fa’’ as science can
prognosticate, his shares will yield as much or
more yearly until the children of to-day are grey-
headed. Rasp stuck to the big mine from the day
he secured his first syndicate share for helping to
peg out the claim.
A certain rich Australian brewer, lately
staying at Southsea, England, one morning was
playing with, or teasing, a little dog belonging to
the hotel-landlord, when the animal turned round
and bit him. There was a great commotion, and
the victim, in mortal dread of hydrophobia, was
taken by Fred. Want to a chemist to have his hand
cauterised. Next morning (the bitee being all the
while in a blue funk) Fred, went to his room and
said, “ Old man, the dog is dead, and the vet. has
just made a post-mortem.” The brewer, intensely
excited, gasped out, “ Oh, tell me what did he die
of? was it rabies?” “No, old fellow,” said the
cheerful Fred., “it was D.T.”
The Hopkins-Searles (U.S.) affair is a
startler. Mrs. Hopkins, 73 years old, was cap-
tured by Searles, an impecunious paper-hanger,
aged 40. Under her management her first hus-
band’s colossal estate had accumulated to 73
millions of dollars— fourteen millions of pounds
sterling —and when she died four years after her
second marriage she left all her money to Searles,
ignoring every other person and thing under
Heaven—not even leaving enough to keep Hop-
kins’ tombstone in order. The lawyers are con-
spiring to burst the will, but it is cleanly and
clearly drawn, and the old woman seems to have
been as sane as Pilcher, Q. C.
William Steward, one of the claimants for
the Victorian reward to the first discoverers of
gold in Bendigo, died suddenly in Cqllingwood
(Melb.), on 17th inst., aged 67. He is said to
have started digging at what is now Golden
Square, Bendigo, in ’5l, in mateship with Chris,
Asquith, Jas. Graham, and Ben Bannister. He
leaves a widow to push on his claim.
Once in a way grovel meets its due reward.
The five-year-old King of Spain recently lured a
venerable military grandee into a damp place.
There was a sassiety “function” going on in the
grounds of the palace when his dear young
Majesty yelled for the old geeser aforesaid to
come and look at some flowers. His Majesty
waited until his loyal subject was bowing particu-
larly low and then turned the garden engine on
him. This is about the funniest thing accomplished
by a crowned head since Emperor Maximilian
got himself murdered, and can only be accounted
for by the extreme youth of the little joker.
There is a place in the Victorian Assembly
reserved for distinguished visitors, and there, just
out of quod, remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow,
and absolutely alone, sat little Jimmy Mirams the
other evening. Right opposite him was John
Nirnmo, and Mirams fixed him with his eye when
he first got in, and kept him fixed all the time.
But Nimmo never looked at him once. He gazed
at the floor with utter nonchalance—in fact,
Nimmo was never half so nonchalant in all his
life before. His dull, fish-like -eye said plainly
that there was no such man as Mirams, and that
Jimmy was hereby abolished, and that he was
beginning to feel convinced that he never had
existed at all.
Charles Sydney Dick Melbourne, a pro-
minent solicitor of Central Queensland, died the
other day at Rockhampton. His real surname
was Dick, but he called himself Melbourne for
exactly the same reason that the present writer
would call himself Bagdad if he felt that way.
U S. D. Melbourne was for many years about the
best lawyer in the city of perspiration, alligators,
and woe, till after a while there arose a small but
brilliant practitioner named Pattison, whose
underjaw stuck out like the firebox of a locomo-
tive, and whose head was just high enough to run
into Melbourne’s bread-basket, and the latter
seemed to get dispirited. His end was peace, and
all the leading citizens of Rockhampton helped to
carry his initials to the grave.
Just read this story, which is going the
rounds of the “good ” papers
A clerical tramp, one of the begging-letter Pecksniffs,
so often met with in London, called at Spurgeon’s house,
but refused to give his name. “ Say, if you please,” said
the tramp, with turned-up eyes, “a servant of Christ asks
for a few moments of his precious time.” The butler
came back immediately with the reply ; “Mr. Spurgeon
requests me to say that he is occupied'with your master.”
The pietists obviously think this a smart retort,
but to the sinner the paragraph is nauseous, not
to say revolting. The idea of a cross-grained, pig-
faced person like Spurgeon personally communing
with God, and sending his message to the other
worm by the butler on the loathsome occasion !
One Pecksniff collided with a still more disgusting
Pecksniff. That’s all.
Brewer Toohey, of the N.S.W. Legisla-
ture, says drink is authorised by the Scriptures.
That is no doubt the chief reason why “Jim”
sells it. Another reason is that grog-selling turns
James and brother John in, say, something
between £20,000 and £40,000 a year. Apropos, an
anecdote of John Toohey. When Pasteur’s dis
covery revolutionised fermentation-theories, the
brewer, to whom a copy of the great physiologist’s
book had been sent by a friend immediately after
its publication, knew no French : nor did he then
know anybody to whom he cared to entrust the
translating, so he went to work in his spare hours
and learnt the language. He learned it so effec-
tually that in a few months he had translated the
book, and begun to make £4OOO a year additional
out of his newly-acquired knowledge.
Old Geoff. Eagar’s scholarship appraised
by Parkes ! It was provocation enough to make
the old Liberal turn in his newly-made grave.
Geoffrey Eagar was not only a good English and
classical scholar, but a fair essayist and poet.
How unlike Parkes ! Eagar was a contributor
to the leading columns of the Monitor, Aus-
tralian, and Examiner ; and he possessed, as a
legacy, the only complete set extant of the
Southern Cross, which abounds with Deniehy’s
brilliant writings. Eagar’s suspension of Duncan,
collector of customs, was resented by Parkes; and
in defence of his old friend, perhaps also in
gratitude for publishing his “ early poems ” in
Duncan’s Weekly Register, in the early forties,
the “old parliamentary hand” resigned his first
portfolio.
Once in a way David Syme is guilty of
something resembling a joke. The other morning
he was standing outside the Age office, consider-
ing the profits how they grow, when his eye fell
upon a former slave of the staff, a dismissed
minion, whose face suggested a pertinent enquiry
as to how the young man was getting along in
the cold world. The ex-representative of the
Age, being rash and forgetful, hinted that he was
making a rapid fortune on vague and general
principles, whereupon David advised the budding
capitalist to step inside the old shop and see the
cashier on urgent business. David remembered
that this young friend had, during one of those
weak moments which overtake the strongest
intellects, contrived to borrow a parting trifle
from the firm on his 1.0. U. The perjured repro-
bate got away, however, leaving David and the
liability still outstanding.

Is War Deadly?
“Can anyone answer that ? It’s doubtful, very
doubtful.” War may not be healthy or con-
ducive to longevity, especially for the front
rank of the participants in the frolicsome pas-
time. We read in the big book how the re-
porters brought home records of hundreds of
thousands slain in a single battle ; but now,
with all our modern deadly weapons, smokeless
powder and noiseless guns, we fall far short of
the numbers slain in the scriptural history days.
We, however, make up for deficiency in this
respect by slaughtering thousands and hundreds
of thousands by living an artificial life. We
constantly struggle to live and obtain wealth,
we cultivate a special form of life to induce
disease, we drink alcohol and other stimulants,
and thus live in a continual condition of nervous
excitement. This enervates the whole system,
but so slowly and insidiously that we never
suspect the danger till some fatal disease attacks
some vital organ, and then the patient runs
panic-stricken, first to one doctor then to
another, in the agony of despair. People should
be wise in their generation, and beware of the
approach of the enemy, and ward off' his initial
attack. Remember that a continual languid
feeling, and sharp attacks of neuralgia at night,
with frequent or occasional headaches, or aching
limbs, sleeplessness, hot burning urine, with
constipation and loss of appetite, are each and
severally signs sent by Nature to warn you of
the physical disturbance, and that you" must
not neglect such symptoms, or your "case may
get beyond the power of medicine to cure. To
turn aside the disease, and render the system
impregnable to its ravages, a faithful and
regular treatment with Clements Tonic is
essential. This remedy never can fail to restore
healthy and normal action to every organ, as it
treats the disease, and not the symptoms. We
received from Alfred Godfrey, Esq., Solicitor,
391 Darling-street, Balmain, the following
letter: “Jan. 19th, ’9l. Dear Sir,—lt affords
me much pleasure to recommend Clements
Tonic to all persons whose systems require
bracing up. I have found it highly beneficial.
I don’t think it’s equal can be found.” Also
the following proof from Mrs. G. Wallis, 6(1
Ivy-street, Redfern, N.S.W. “ Dear Sir, —
Having suffered for nearly two years from
sciatica, and, being unable to obtain relief from
doctors, I was induced to use Clements Tonic.
I had small hopes of relief; but one large and
part of a small bottle completely cured me, and
that is now eight months since. The pain first
struck my left-side, extending to the back and
down the leg below the knee. At times the
pain was so severe that 1 could not rest day or
night. I became so very thin and weak that
my neighbours chaffed mo, and said there would
soon be a funeral; but, thanks to Clements
Tonic, I am completely cured. My daughter
also suffered severely from toothache and pains
across the eyes. She used Clements Tonic, and
is completely well ever since. I have also
recommended it to many people, all of whom,
praise it highly, and you may use this as you
like, and I shall be only too pleased to answer
any enquiries, trusting I may bring relief to
other sufferers. ” These are the kind of letters
we are continually receiving by every mail.
We only warn the public to be careful about
getting the genuine. There are imitations in
every chemist’s shop. See the signature of E-
Moore Clements on the wrappers and labels of
every bottle, and expose the swindlers who try
and put you oft' with an imitation.—Labor-
atories, Newtown, N.S.W.

Queensland Government proposes an
export duty of £3 or £4 per ton on pearl-shell. As
well try to tax native bears’ tails.
The substance of all late Canadian cable-
grams is that the leading local politicians have
been running in winkers for years past.
The Local Option party in the N.S.W,
Assembly w r ere divided over G. D. Clark’s prohi-
bition resolution. A “split” in the soda party.
To the N.S.W. Parliament Parkes has
candidly confessed that the paid Public Works
Committee has become “ a source of viciousness.”
And corruption ?
Macrossan once said in Bananaland Parlia-
ment“lf Separation be not granted, the North
will go into liquidation, and the South will become
Permanent Receiver.”
The redoubtable A. G. Taylor, who is
leaving Sydney shortly to edit a new Melbourne
paper,"will run for a seat in the Victorian Parlia-
ment at next general election.
Premier Griflith says he is personally in
favour of One-man-one-vote, but his Cabinet won’t
include it in the Government policy. Well, then,
down with the Griffith Cabinet!
“In cases of dire necessity, it is best to
sacrifice principles to expediency.”— Col. See.
Tozer, of Q. Mem. It is now a dire necessity to
squelch the coming Queensland Labour-party.
Parkes has now declared his intention
“at all hazards ” of proceeding with the Common-
wealth Bill after certain domestic legislation is
dealt with. Is this a challenge to Parliament to
relieve him of office?
Nobody denounced “ constitutional ” Eng-
land when she was believed to have seized Mity-
lene, Turkish territory, without consulting any-
body the other day. But suppose Russia had
done it —how wicked !
The N.S.W. Parliament has approved by
a heavy vote of the seduction of seats by Ministers
with promises of roads, railways, and bridges.
“Now, who will stand on either_hand and keep
the bridge with me ? ”
Several gaols in N.S.W., built at a cost of
£lO,OOO or £12,000, have never yet been tenanted
by a prisoner. The only prisoner which one
costly gaol has contained was the brother of a
member of Parliament.
“I know that we have a good many hum-
bugs in connection with the government of the
colony, including His Excellency the Governor. ’
— John Plumper Hoolan, M.L.A. for Burke , Q. ,
in Queensland Leg. Assembly.
Valuable cablegram a day or two ago:
SirM. Hicks-Beaeh, addressing his constituents,
pointed out the advantages of the English labour-
ing man over his Australian confrere, living in a
log hut, with no church, and no workus !
The N.S.W. Assembly, fearing that, should
Glen Innes Hutchison, M.P., be encouraged in
his abstract notions reflecting upon the Almighty’s
construction and management of the world, the
Deity might send in its resignation, sits on Hutchi-
son every time.
The Democratic Freetrade Association of
Victoria is not quite dead yet. It has found a
young man willing to act as secretary without a
salary, and so long as the funds of the Association
“run ” to stamps and stationery the great national
movement will wobble along.
At the Adelaide Eight-hours’ Demonstra-
tion, Governor Kintore, the cheeky philo-Chinee,
advised the Labour-party to “ go slow ” in their
reform efforts. The Labour-party has got suffi-
cient sense to do exactly the opposite to anything
that Kintore seriously advises.
Lobby whispers formulate themselves into
echoes that E. B. Snttor is the coining Leader of
the N.S.W. Opposition, and the probable successor
to the Premiership when Parkes gives, or is
kicked, out. What a diabolical “double” that
would be—for Dibbs and Parkes !
A hint given by John Donaldson, ex-
leader of Queensland Opposition, that he might
yet have an opportunity of arguing publicly
against Premier Griffith “on a particular ooca-
sion,” has been construed to mean that Donaldson
intends contesting North Brisbane.
The British War Office has, as per a recent
official document, concluded that “ unreasoning
compliance with orders is no longer obtainable
from men who are permeated with quasi-educa-
tion’’ and that “ this must be seriously considered
in all future dealings with soldiers.”
The democratic party in N.S.W. Assembly
will no doubt shortly want Parkes to explain why
he allows the nominee Council to obstruct the
passage of liberal legislation. The Upper House
lias agreed to a man, it is said, not to pass the
Bill repealing the old conspiracy laws.
Sir Charles Dilke says that the French
soldier is the finest war-material in Europe. So
mote it be.! that when a war comes the victorious
banner of the Republican nation which pioneered
the world’s freedom may be carried through tire
capital of every monarch who fights France.
An augury for France. The great
“ Column of "Victory,” which the sauerkraut men
put up at Berlin after the last war, is slowly
moving out of the perpendicular, and evidently
means to fall. And the head of the crippled
trophy is pointing in a direct line for Paris.
Will the N.S.W. Labour Members compel
Parkes to “flood” the nominee Upper House
with men pledged to effect democratic mea-
sures? The Bulletin means will they compel
him to flood it at once and without posturing and
gabbling and wasting time about the matter ?
The Canadian Dominion legislators are
agitating for a salary equal to that “attached to
membership of the proposed Australian Federal
Parliament.” Sir ’Enry was not born in vain.
The problematical payment of his visionary house
has already developed into a “ useful precedent.”
The Australian Star says, and says
truly, that the deterioration in N.S.W. Assembly
dates from the time when Parkes became a
political leader and bestowed portfolios on
illiterate political adventurers ; and by travelling
on sectarianism degraded the personnel of the
House.

A GENTLE HINT.
(At a dingy restaurant.)
“Aw! waiter!—er—bring me some pudding, and—er—put a lot on the plate—I'm short-
sighted!”
The flotation of the N.S.W. 4| million
loan was so problematic in Parkes’ judgment that
lie cabled a pile of figures in the hope of creating
“ a boom.” It is not the value of the private and
public wealth of N.S.W. that troubles the money-
dealers, but the difficulty of unloading N.b.VV.
stock at a handsome profit.
“In N.S.W., Bills are drawn by one
draftsman, and they are notoriously the worst in
the colonies—l may almost say in the British
dominions. . . . The amount of litigation in
connection with Acts of Parliament m Queens-
land is not more than 5 per cent, of that of the
neighbouring colony of N.S. W. ’—Premier Griffith,
Q.C. .1
The N.S.W. Ministry do not always al
drink out of the same cup. Last week an ordi-
narily very smooth-tongued Minister was heard
shouting out to a colleague in the Ministerial
room : “You’re a damned fool, sir” Ihe Parkes
Cabinet should hermetically seal the door of the
Ministerial room when next they indulge in
slang-whang over a Parliamentary adjournment
at 2 a.m.
Member Haynes, M.P., to Lawyer Wise*
M.P. in N.S.W. Parliament Act as a tele-
phone between this Chamber and the Supreme
Court to let the Judges know that a body of demo-
cratic men in this Parliament are determined to
advance foot by foot in besieging'the position of
the lawyers. Having put down Ben Hall and all
the other highwaymen, they will now put down
the lawyers.”
The N.S.W. Parliament is a byword
amongst the Australias Even its square-jawed
Speaker is inoculated with a spirit of wanton
waywardness. According to Speaker Abbott, if
the Parliament decide in, say, January not to
raise additional revenue, it cannot reverse that
decision or even entertain the question again in
that session, though it last a twelvemonth, and
the State treasury be reduced to its last copper .
Tawell, the duly-hanged Quaker, who
founded the teetotal movement in Sydney, was
cited by John Haynes to the prohibitionists in
the N.S.W. Parliament, to show that women and
children have as much to fear from teetotallers as
from drinkers. Tawell knocked the heads on
many casks of rum and emptied the liquor into
Port Jackson, just ere plunging up to his neck in
a cold-blooded crime which convulsed the world.
Sir John Downer, Q.C., in the S.A.
Legislative Assembly:—
They must first of all agree on some principle as to
what gives the right to property. The only natural right
that there could be to any property was derived from its
being acquired by the actual industry of brain or hand or
an individual exercising his right 101116 free exercise ot
his body and mind. That was his first proposition,
that a man has no right to any properly except that
which he has created as the result of his ability and
energy.
Sir John’s Tory pals are trying to get him to
recant these revolutionary utterances.
“All men are not equal,” writes a Cen-
tral Australian correspondent. ‘‘ls there a
man in New South Wales equal to as a liar
and a living lazar-house of everything contempti-
ble under the sun?” The Bulletin unhesitatingly
replies—“ Yes.” The man whose name is most
generally accepted as synonymous with lying does
not represent St. Leonards, but an inland con-
stituency. You ask any member of the N.S.W.
Assembly.
Purkcs, bless you, is in no dilemma about
Supreme Court Judge Water-jug I oon
threatened retirement on full pension of £IolO
yearly after but 3| years’ alleged service. He
wants him to retire. Attorney-General Simpson
(in whom there can’t be much more than 3 2 years
wear and tear as a Judge) would then be Judge
Simpson (with a prospective pension say jive years
hence, of £lB2O annually,) and Toby Barton would
bo Attorney-General with the reversion of the next
judgeship.
Apropos of David Christie Murray s allega-
tions that Australians are drunken, statistics
show that of all the civilised countries only
Russia, Austria and the United States show a
lower consumption of spirits, and N.S.W. Govern-
ment Statist Coghlan points out that if the great
preponderance of males over females in Australia
is to be taken into account the figures will show
still more creditably for us. In Great Britain the
consumption of alcohol per head is o o i gallons,
while in Australia it is but 2'82.
In a leader on the West Australian Chinese
question, the S.M. Hehald has the following
It was but recently that the Governor of the latter
colony declared in unequivocal terras, based on personal
observation, that the tropical parts of Australia must be
so developed, if developed at all; and his words have not
only sunk deep into the minds of many in Western and
South Australia, but have created a marked impression
in England,
In connection with this, the public should read
“ Delcomyn’s ” letter on Governor Kintore in the
Territory, published in this week’s Bulletin.
Archbishop Walsh tries to put the ecclesi-
astical “comether” on Parnell and Kitty
O’Shea: —
The guilt of adultery, so far from being washed away, is
but deepened and blackened when the sinners, instead of
turning from their evil ways, deliberately enter into a
compact to continue their sinful career.
If this is the law of the guilt of adultery, pray
what is the canon for the guilt of fornication?
Can the Archbishop ever make the world believe
it sinful to “ make an honest woman ” of a fallen
one?
Jawbone Neild, leaderof tbeN. S. W. Orange
party : —“ For years I have refused to say as
much as good afternoon to Sir Henry Parkes. I
have met Sir Henry Parkes in the passages and
lobbies, and he has been no more to me than a
doorpost. He has addressed me in this House,
and 1 have rcfrsed to reply to him. His conduct
was as dishonourable, as base, and as malicious
as if it came heated with the breath of hell.”
Thus spoke the head of the Yellow Pup party,
whose favour Parkes seems to have been courting
in vain.
A Vegetable Products Commission has
been tracking the Victorian cabbage to its lair for
seven long years, so Jimmy Munro is girding up
his loins for an effort to squelch that ancient
institution. The commission is one guinea per
sitting for each member, about the same as the
virtuous and economical James draws from his
various board-meetings. But whereas some of
Jimmy’s companies are addicted to winding them-
stives up within a reasonable time, the vegetable
products enquiry might draw on the public funds
for evermore, lienee the Victorian Premier’s dis-
satisfaction.
Parkes’ Cabinet, though it exists on the
sufferance of the Labour-party, jibs at the passing
of a Bill to compensate seamen injured through
the negligence or the avarice of shipowners in not
properly equipping their ships. Minister Gould
objects to the Bill leaving the Assembly, because
it is slightly “incomplete.” How badly would
this flimsy objection tell against all Parkes’
measures? Often and often Mr. Gould has gi t
the approval of the Assembly to a Bill on the
condition that it would be amended in some
respecter other in the Council. Why, then, this
new-born opposition ?
J. M. Toomoy, secretary of Young (N.S. W.)
branch of the Shearers’ Union, reports that everj -
thing is going splendidly under the new Conference
agreement; that non-union shearers and general
labourers are fairly rushing the Union for tickets;
that shearers are scarce in almost every part of
N.S.W. ; that on the Murrumbidgee and lower
part of the Lachlan there is room for fully 800
of them ; that the wonderful development of the
General Labourers’ Union has caused a rise in
wages from 15s. and 20s. to 255. and 30s. per week ;
that a plan has been mooted for forming an Acci-
dent and Funeral Fund in connection with the
two unions; and that the annual demonstration
will be held in November next.
The Bulletin loathes prohibition and the
pi’ohibitionists, but it likes logic. G. H. Reid
sees the case clearly—from his own point of view.
Liquor-prohibition, as applied to confirmed
bachelors, would be an outrage on liberty. Every
man who is a hopeless, virtuous bachelor has an
absolutely inalienable right to the management of
his own carcase, and must be permitted to stoke
it with whatever he .pleases whenever he pleases.
Anyone prepared to deny this proposition must
be counted in with the tyrants who want to com-
pulsorily foist their own peculiar spiritual
nostrums on to the souls of other citizens. It is
only when an over-drinking bachelor —which
G.H.R. isn't—proposes to get married—which
we hear G.HR. doesn’t—and hand down to his
progeny the alcoholically-induced transmissible
diseases of his organism, that the State has any
right to interfere.
There was a queer debate in the Victorian
Legislative Council last week over a Bill to enable
the sale of properties attached to St. James’
Anglican Cathedral, Melbourne. Behold in this
ease some of the mischievous sequelae of State aid
to religion. A big chunk of rich city property
was given, half-a-century ago, to St. James’.
The Church leased all the frontages (now im-
mensely valuable) to Collins-street and William-
street, for warehouses, and now wants to sell right
out, applying the money to alien purposes alto-
gether—nominally “Gospel propagation in the
bush.” The West Melbourne members objected
that if the freehold be given the money ought to
be expended in the evidently needful work of
gospelising West Melbourne, but that doesn t suit
the good old Church at all. One impudent logician
declares that the coin ought to go back where it
belongs—into the consolidated revenue.
The temper of JS.S. W. Parliament is
strongly averse to Griffith’s Federation scheme.
In the Council the Constitution will be amended
for a certainty ; in the Assembly, it is viewed
with undisguised hostility by a large majority,
but at present no one can gauge the intentions of
the opposing elements that constitute the majority.
The House, as a whole, may shelve the question,
or it may consent to re-cast the Bill. Several
members had determined to teat the feeling of the
House on a union of the provinces “under the
Crown.” But of this privilege they are now
deprived by the imprudent action of Republican
Rae, M.P., in giving notice for a distant date of a
specific motion in favour of a fedei’ation on Repub-
lican lines. If Parkes moves his resolutions, as
doubtless he will, antecedent to that date, the
Republicans in the House cannot raise the dis-
tinct issue, and will have to vote on the merits of
the Griffith scheme. Speaker Abbott is bound,
both by rule and by feeling, to prevent any general
reference to the coming Australian Republic : any
detailed discussion is prevented by the existence
of Rae’s motion on the notice-paper. What Rae
should have done was to table his motion as a
contingent amendment on Parkes’ resolutions.
Of the stupid drafting of Parkes’ Repre-
sentatlon of the People Bill, a few clauses will
give an insight. The secrecy of the ballot is
removed, for instance, by a provision requiring
the presiding officer to place on the ballot-paper
the number opposite the elector’s name on the
roll. Again, there was a clause enabling a
scrutineer or any two voters to call upon the
retuvning-ofticer to put a series of questions to
each intending voter. What a powerful weapon
to put in the hands of the capitalistic classes!
As the challenging would occupy at least five
minutes in each case, how many workers could
possibly vote in their leisure hour? The plan of
the capitalistic classes would be to poll in the
morning, and block the workers with these ques-
tions in the dinner-hour and evening. Fortun-
ately, the power has been placed solely in the
discretion of the scrutineers. No machinery was
originally provided to allow a dumb or deaf or
illiterate person to vote ; the defect has been
cured. A wager on the result of an election
renders the maker, man or woman, liable to a
penalty of £2O. No more new hats or dresses !

The latest is that the Burdekins are making
a big splash, as such splashes go, in London. ITp
to date they have had the sense to avoid chronic-
ling their social achievements in the Morning
Post and the Court Journal, but “ they seem to
go everywhere,” writes our correspondent. Mrs.
Burdekin’s good looks and nice manner have done
a lot for the gilded Sydney. Luncheons en fci'inille
at Burdett-Coutts’; dinners sans ceremonie at
Devonshire House; smart supper-parties at the
Amphitryon, &c., &c., are part of their every-day
programme. The handsome Duchess of Bucking-
ham appears to have taken a violent fancy to the
ex-Mayoress of Sydney.
s* * *
“ Miss Burdekin,” continues the scribe
above-quoted, “ is very mheh admired, and indeed
she is an exceedingly pretty girl. There is great
trepidation in more than one quarter lest the
m irked attention which young Victor Cavendish
pays her may not —er —ripen into something
warmer. Victor is, as you are no doubt aware,
the heir-presumptive of the Duke of Devonshire,
and as such is, of course, looked upon as the
‘ parti ’ of the day.
* * *
“ Alreadyparty wire-pullersare on the look-
out for Burdekin, and are trying to discover what
side he will favour in politics. It seems to be
quite taken for granted that he will settle down in
England, buy a big estate and blossom into a
bloated aristocrat. My own private opinion is
that he will do so, and that Australia will know
him no more, except as a flying visitor. It is
very probable that the portals of either the
Carlton or Reform would respond to his ‘ open
sesame ’ were he inclined to seek a seat in Parlia-
ment. The Tories in particular would like to
pick up a few rich men who would open their
pockets and keep their mouths shut. Everybody
wonders who is running the Burdekins. They,
themselves, give no hint.

“ The moral of the whole business is—and
let intending visitors take it to heart—when you
come to England and wish to get among the real
haul ton , don’t brag of any swell acquaintances
you may have made; and, above all, don’t blow
about your money.”

Mr. and Mrs. Henniker Heaton arrive by
the Victoria next week. Henniker has made a
success in the Commons by never talking about
what he doesn’t understand. He has devoted
himself to the postal business, which he has at his
fingers’ ends, and he is as sure to carry penny
ocean postage as that the sun is shining.

Henniker aforesaid has earned the undying
gratitude of ladies by making the British Post-
office authorities telegraph “shan’t” as one word

The Bulletin suggests that Ministers of

It would appear that Griffiths, the mili-
tary officer who mysteriously disappeared on his
wedding-eve at Melbourne is not dead, but gone
before. His reason for clearing out appears to
have been that he was required to become a
proselyte to the religion of his fiancee. It is not
every man who, having to elect between his God
and his girl, gives preference to the former.

The N.S.W. Parliament is seriously asked
by Minister Carruthers to allow a woman to
register the name of any man as the father of her
, illegitimate child without giving the man an
opportunity of seeing, or contradicting (or making
her prove) her statement.
* * *
Many persons will sympathise with a pro-
minent N.S.W. civil servant who has been
brought low through speculating on the advice of
confiding friends. When “he held it” he was
generous to a degree, as his big prizes to scientific
sport always proved.

Under J. B. (short for Jawbone) Neild’s
Suppression of Vice Bill any one, male or female,

Jawbone’s former proposal that 12 months’
imprisonment (now altered to three years) should
carry divorce with it was cutting tilings rather
fine. It was perilously on the borderland of a
time when a married diner-out, who had managed
to get locked up on account of the salmon and
other things, might find himself a single man after
doing 24 hours “without the option.”

Pybus and Wateidiouse, recent absconders
from Sydney, are natives of Vandemonia. A few
years back Pybua lost an elder brother, a hand

Not long ago" the chief of a Government
department in one of the Australias reported a
subordinate for dismissal on the ground that he
was “an incurable invalid.” The ministerial head
of the department refused to adopt the recom-
mendation, and when the subordinate came to
hear what his chief had done he waited on the
latter and stated his intention of having his chief’s
name brought up in Parliament on the ground
that he was an incurable lunatic. Strangely
enough the chief almost immediately resigned his
position.

It is satisfactory to note that Longstaff,

There was quite a pretty row t’other day
at a southern home of vice-royalty over an excess
charge—as her ladyship maintained—of one
shilling in the price of a trumpeter-fish. Which
reminds us that the great bother between one of
the vice-regal man’s predecessors, Sir John
Franklih, and his Colonial Secretary—a trouble
which threw a shadow over the sturdy seaman’s
later years—had its rise in the cabbage from
Government House kitchen-garden ! Montague,
the Secretary, complained that Lady F. reduced
his quantity of cabbage; and madam answered by
stopping all allowances.

The story of the sufferings of the Mildura
stokers supplies a good deal of food for contem-
plation (this latter is a S.M. Herald phrase, that
journal being a heavy feeder and much addicted
to contemplating things). Among other things it
reminds us of a recipe for live roast duck which
we once came across in a black-letter cookery-
book. It set forth that the duck was to bo
plucked and fastened inside a circle of live coals,
and cold water put on the wretched fowl’s head
and breast to keep it up, till it was nicely roasted.
Then it was to be brought into the dining-room in
its last moments, and placed on the table artisti-
cally browned and howling among the gravy.
The Mildura stoker hadn’t any gravy, and he
was badly cooked, being burnt a good-deal on
one side and underdone on the other, and
when he was ready he was served up in the lee
scuppers instead of on a dish, but still there were
a good many points of resemblance between the
two animals. Also, he reminds us somewhat of
the so-called Fire King, who, in the days of our
childhdod, used to go into a hot oven, naked,
except as to a pair of non-conducting shoes, and
sit on a camp-stool alongside a raw leg of mutton
until the mutton was cooked. Then he would eat
a bit of meat to show that there was no deception,
and come out and realise the applause and the
gate-money. Barring the applause and the gate-
money and the asbestos shoes and the mutton,
the resemblance between the Fire King and the
Mildura stoker amounts to quite a surprising
coincidence.

Mrs. Taylor, the notorious Melbourne
abortionist, who the other day was sentenced to
be hanged, and is now “doing” 15 years, had
nearly been tried by an old acquaintance, Judge
Hickman Molesworth. She did appear before
him at Ballarat Assizes, but the defence were not
ready to go on, and so the case was postponed
and tried in Melbourne. When Mrs. T. first
appeared before the Courts—some 14 years ago—
she stood in the dock with a pretty young French-
woman named Monichon, in the old Supreme
Court. Purves defended Monichon, and Moles-
worth, Taylor. While the jury were “in,” Hick-
man discussed the probabilities of the verdict
with the reporters. “ Purves had the advantage
over me,” thoughtfully observed young Moles-
worth. “He is defending the pretty woman.”
However, both got off then; the pretty one
perhaps pulled the other one through.
Dear Bulletin, — I have just read Rolf
Boldrewood’s “Squatter’s Dream.” One of the
chief scenes is laid in Kaverina, and the author
sets his aboriginal characters “ensnaringof eels ”
in one of the local rivers (Vide cap. 111., page 34).
Now, there are no eels in that part of the country
—none in any of the waters west of the Dividing
Range.—Yours, H. J. McOooky. Cadia, Sept. 14.

“The Inventor” writes us thus from
Melbourne: —
Dear Bulletin, — The discussion which is taking place
in your columns re the inventorship of “ Wolseley ”
shearing-machine is becoming interesting and amusing—
interesting as showing how ready some people are to
take unto themselves credit for other people’s work, and
amusing inasmuch as the bogus claims of Howard and his
friends can be settled by an appeal to the patent-office,
where, I assure you, that neither Mr. Wolseley’s name nor
that of his man Howard will be found attached to this
machine. — The Inventor. Melbourne, Sept. 14.
Theßulletin begs to remark that the Patent-office
does not necessarily furnish the slightest evidence
as to who invented anything. One of the most in-
genious inventions we ever saw was patented in
the name of a certain Abraham Moses—who had
lent the inventor some £2 ss. or so, at 650 per
shent monthly, and foreclosed the mortgage on his
brains. Neither does the ownership of a house
show who built it, or the ownership of a new
country show who discovered it, and the possession
of hair doesn’t prove that the possessor grew it.
He may have bought it in a shop. “The In-
ventor ” doesn’t authorise us to give his name. If
he really invented the Wolseley-machine he ought
to stand up publicly and sav so out loud.

The War Cry. solemnly relates how the
hallelujah mother of the Salvation “ Receiving
House ” at Christchurch (Maoriland) discovered
the other day, that the potatoes had run out.
Therefore the members of the household were
ordered to go down on their knees and pray hax-d,
and while they were praying two sacks and one
small bag of murphies arrived suddenly. Tha
story ends there. Presumably the three bags
dashed furiously in at the garden-gate by them-
selves, for no mention is made of anybody arriv-
ing along with them. This ugly rush on the part
of the vegetables is described as a perfectly com-
mon incident in Salvation circles; the Army
simply prays when it is hungry, and food comes
tearing up the street immediately afterwards.

The girl Powell, who unsuccessfully pro-
secuted Dr. Massey, of Wycheproof (Vic.), for
alleged criminal assault, has, it is satisfactory to
hear, been committed for perjury on very clear
prima-facie evidence. The hysterical - woman
question is one of the troublesome problems of the
age. The worst of it is that about 30 per cent, of
the_ women who bring false charges ruin
their man. To show the lengths to which
hysteria will bring a woman, there is the case of
the girl who fatally shot herself in an English
railway carriage the other day, and said a man
had done it after assaulting her. She lied with
her dying breath.

An Englishman writes to a Yankee paper
from Freemantle, Western Australia :
I buy my tobacco here from a man who, on board a
ship, cooked for dinner the mate’s head that some of the
crew had cut off. I often have business with a master-
mariner whose crime was rolling a man about up and
down the deck in a cask with nails driven through it
until he died. My meat I buy from a wealthy butcher
who was also sent out for his country’s good. A wealthy
bookseller is also an old hand. A leading jeweller and
watchmaker is another. I touch my hat to a gentleman
as he drives to business in his carriage-and-pair, who was
sent here for life for scuttling ships, thereby losing crews
and ships. A celebrated and wealthy pearl-merchant and
storekeeper, with whom I am well acquainted, came here
for forging Russian bank-notes. Since I have been here I
have been in almost daily intercourse with two mur-
derers, one clever embezzler who was town supervisor
here and is now in durance vile, five or six forgers, and
thieves innumerable ; so, you see, I have seen a variety of
the convict profession.

A Perth (W.A.) pressman, detailed to
report a recent Mayoral ball, mixed up the order
of the supper procession (as it appeared on the
programme) with the names of the dancers of
the first set of quadrilles. And so it came to pass
that the West Australian recorded, as an
alleged fact, that Bishop Parry, in knickers and
gaiters, partnered with Miss Wrenfordsley, and
footed it agilely in the opening quadrille. Mrs.
Parry seems to have fairly “squirmed” with
indignation, and has written hotly to the Perth
press denying the insinuations made, and assert-
ing that “ the Bishop has never taken part in a
dance since taking Holy Orders.”

Mrs. Harrison Lee, lecturing in Melbourne

A Melbourne Chinaman, married to ye poor
Hibernianess, packed their infant, a few months
old, off to China —och, wirrasthroo ! A young
woman, in Melbourne, married a man out of pity,
because he was dying of consumption, and entirely
supported him, but he willed away their unborn
child to the care of strangers. However, this was
just as well. The child of a dying consumptive
would be no great “ catch.”

An esteemed female inhabitant died in
America, the other day, and next day the bereaved
husband took unto himself a new wife. Somehow
the inhabitants failed to approve of this, and on
the wedding night they banged tin-kettles and
tooted strange discords on cow-horns outside the
window of the happy pair. They tooted and
hissed and barked for two hours, and then sud
denly the window flew up, and the bride, in a
fluttering white garment, appeared, and spoke in
reproachful accents. “Gentlemen,” she said,
“ this is most unseemly. Are you not aware that
a funeral took place from this house this very
morning ? Have you no regard for the memory
of the dead, or for the feelings of a bereaved
husband? How dare you profane the house of
mourning?” The crowd hadn’t looked at the
matter in that light before, and it silently cleared
out.

RADAM'S MICROBE KILLER.

To Radam’s Microbe Killer Company.
Dear Sirs, —I have been a great sufferer for oyer
sixteen years from pains in the legs from the hips
down to the toes, and also in great misery for
nine years from a kidney disease, during which
time I found I was losing the use of my legs,
particularly the right one, from weakness in the
joints. I tried nearly every known remedy, and
received but little relief until I commenced to use
the MICROBE KILLER.
It is now eight weeks since I commenced its
use, and having used two one-gallon jars, I find
myself an entirely different man. I believe a
little more will entirely cure my complaints, as I
can say that I have not felt so well for eight or
nine years, and can now do my work as well as
ever I could, and also enjoy my meals, which for
many years I could not. —I remain, yours thank-
fully ’ THOS. FISHLR

for a month for alleged reckless navigation on the
occasion when the Manaponri lately touched
ground near Cape Schanck. It was the captain s

in the intercolonial trade for 35. Captain Logan
is a brave seaman, possessing the esteem and con-
fidence of all classes, and his proper pride and
sense of honour are in no small degree displayed
in the manner he takes to heart what by many
men would be considered a small trouble. People
generally think that fti consideration of his stain-

certificate at once.

and there isn’t a word of Sir Redmond. Ormond

bourne’s three productions. St. Parchrick’s, of
course, gets due glory. The Anglican Cathedral

There is a man going round Tasmania in a
mysterious way selling obscene literature at a high
figure, and making a large profit thereon. Each
book is tied up with string so that the buyer can’t
open it until after purchasing, but the name of
some horribly dank and foul publication is on the
cover. Therefore the large, unctuous deacon buys
it in an obscure corner and goes away to read it
secretly under a gum-tree, and when he opens it
he finds nothing inside but a little girl’s Sunday-
school story, with a harmless moral. There is
hardly a gum-tree in all Tasmania now which
hasn’t some old, clean-shaved Christian cursing
under it, and kicking off the bark to a height of
eight feet or more, in his rage. And nobody can
sue the hawker for selling immoral literature, for
there isn’t enough immorality in his literature to
disturb your grandmother with; neither can he
be charged with false pretences, for no one cares
to swear that he was swindled, because the book
he bought ought to have been offensive, and
wasn’t. It is a great and profitable game.

TO OUR BEST GIRL IN ENGLAND.
I love thee, darling, with a love intense,
1 loved thee well in England’s frigid clime;
I love thee here, where wild mosquitoes prance,
I mix thee up with scenery sublime.
For thee the kangaroos shall madly dance
(I’ll wrench thee from the land of frost and rime).
The alligator’s crocodilian chants
In ichthyosaurian tropes of ponderous rhyme
Shall bid “ Australia ” onwardly “ advance ”
To happy make thy glorious coming time
Some day perchance!
Then shall the savage throw his boomerang
High in the air his frenzy to express;
The dingo yelp, while bucks the wild mustang
To greet 'thee in thy queenly loveliness.
The bullock-bells upon the ranges clang
(Be sure you wear a pretty muslin dress).
The eucalypti branches proudly hang,
The measure of thy beauty to confess ;
The ’possum and the sweet ourang-outang
Shall climb the trees to worship thee, I guess—
While joy-bells bang !
The punciana’s gorgeous ruby hue,
The wallaby’s sweet song, the mopoke’s hoot,
Shall all unite in homage unto you ;
But far beyond, the rapturous bandicoot
Shall startle nature with a wild halloo
To all the South thy qualities to moot.
The platypus shall join the cockatoo,
The wattles throb with pleasure to each root;
And in thine honor every scenic view
Shall be presented in its Sunday suit —-
In Woolloomooloo!
Haste to the land of warrigal, of frog,
Of stringy bark, of kurrajong, of creek,
Oi thirstv drought, of flood, of native dog,
Of platypus (that strange mammalian freak);
Of syndicate, of fern, of cedar log,
Of pelican's exaggerated beak,,
Of strikes, of sport, of pugilistic slog.
List to thy lover’s melancholy shriek !
Forsake the land of Socialist and fog
And book for New South Wales next Tuesday
week —
Thy love to seek.

FATHER NEILD OR FATHER PARKES?
(A N.S.W. PARLIAMENTARY LAY.)
All along for years on years unwelcome babies
came and went, #
And humanity sat silent in a silent Parliament.
Mothers, stricken with the sudden penalty of
wayward love,
Posted back, first chance they got, the pi’esents
sent them from above.
Other mothers, crushed and broken in subsistence
ceaseless fight,
And obliged themselves to starve or put their
burdens out of sight,
Gave the scanty coins they mustered in their
narrow, cheerless lot .
For a refuge for their offspring in an alien lap or
cot.
So a trade or a profession with a keen financial
aim . ,
Grew to ponderous proportions on necessity ana
shame.
For a sum in hand, or for instalments paid at
stated times
Need could end its troubles, Passion end the
sequels of its crimes.
In the trade the babe was entered as if taken in to
nurse,
But instead of cot or cradle it was rocked off in a
hearse,
Still the Parliament was silent till, the other
night, arose
Jawbone to place the woes of babes before lus
friends and foes.
With such truth and sympathetic tones he dwelt
upon his theme
That the House, with small corrections, ratified
his healing scheme.
But as soon as Parkes discovered that another
might go down
As the father and the saviour of the babies of the
town,
All his hair stood up protesting, and he suddenly
made known
That he had a scheme which laid out Neild and
left the field his own.
Out the scheme came; and the fight is now between
the rival guns,
Which shall figure—Neild or Parkes—as father of
the little ones ?
In the meantime while the rivals fume and glare
and jaw and curse,
Little lost ones keep on going—rocked off in the
same old hearse.

«A GOLDEN SHANTY.
TT IS INCONVENIENT,
UNPROFITABLE,
AND PARTICULARLY FOOLISH
To buy rubbish of an} 7 sort. If the best article of
its class cannot be obtained in one place it can in
another, and it is always bad policy to be bluffed
into buying the second best of anything, just for
the sake of effecting a temporary saving of either
time or money. For the saving
IS ONLY TEMPORARY,
and regrets, like curses, come home to roost.
This advice has a good, all round, general ap-
plication, but it is rarely heeded because it is so
cheap and common. The foolish housewife
listens to it and smiles, but vaunteth to herself
meanwhile her superior wisdom, while the wise one
closes one eye in silent meditation, and scores a
notch upon the handle of the broom or the head
of her nearest offspring, whereby she may after-
wards refresh her memory
AND PROFIT BY IT.
In no sense is this well-seasoned hint of so much
value as in its application to the purchase of oil
for domestic use, and in the best interests of every
consumer this should be cut out and pasted in the
hat of the head of every household. Never buy
inferior oil until you have discovered an insurance
company that will
TAKE ALL RISKS.
And even then it would be an unwise thing to do,
because as the time, place, and probabilities of
the risk are uncertain, the premium must be
abnormally high. Higher even than the wreckage
might be expected to go, and the contemplation
of that alone should be sufficient to impress the
merits of Luxene, the new illuminant, on the
minds of all Christian peoples.
LUXENE HAS NO SMELL,
GIVES A BEAUTIFUL LIGHT,
IS VERY ECONOMICAL,
AND UNQUESTIONABLY SAFE.
Try it, and be for ever grateful for the advice,
which is as disinterested as it is sound.
LOST TREASURE.
Mr. Win. Morgan, Chairman of the Pnkekohe
(N.Z.) East Highway Board, writes as follows;
“During harvesting operations in January last
one of my boys had the misfortune to lose his
Waterbury, but where he had no idea. He
searched the paddock, but could not discover the
lost treasure. A few days ago, however, one of
our neighbours picked it up, wound it, and it
started to go at once, although it had been lying
on the ground exposed to the weather for two
months. Surely such a fact is worthy of record
for the popular Waterbury.”

COLGATE’S
SOAPS and PERFUMES
KEEP IT FOR REFERENCE.
The following suggestions are not designed to
induce the public to attempt the duties of the
regular surgeon, but merely to place the reader in
possession of a means of treatment of the minor
accidents occurring daily in the household. No
family can be assured against accidents; the
broken bone, the dislocated joint, the severed
artery, these are misfortunes that may possibly
happen to anyone; and we scarcely need to add
that they demand the instant attention of the
most skilful surgeon within reach. But by house-
hold accidents we mean those which are constantly
occurring every day, in nearly every family, and
which,’while not always dangerous in themselves,
are exceedingly annoying. Burns, bruises, cuts,
scalds, sprains, &c., are principal among these
troublesome and annoying occurrences, and
demand immediate treatment with the best means
at hand. In the kitchen, the dining hall, the
nursery, and the sitting room they are liable to
happen, and instead of fear and alarm at the
sight of the cut or smashed finger, or burned or
bruised arm, or scalded surface, a cool and quiet
manner should be assumed, and after washing
away the blood (if required), the injured parts
should be dressed with that most valuable remedy
—St. Jacobs Oil. Its especial worth for the
injuries named, and others of a similar nature,vis
not based upon mere claim and assertion ; but its
constant use for a long term of years has given it a
reputation which is always increasing. Its sur-
prisingly quick relief, its cleansing properties, its
tendency to quickly remove all inflammation, and
its wonderful efficacy in the above, as well as in
all muscular and other pains, such as rheumatism,

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and ci body nour-
ished with pure blood.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be used from pimples to scrofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success.
Treatment. Cuticura, the great skin cure, and Cuticura Soap, an exquisite
skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-
in a, and inflammation, soothe and heal raw and irritated surfaces, clear the skin and
scalp of crusts and scales, and restore the hair, while Cuticura Resolvent, the new
blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor remedies, cleanses the blood of all
impurities and poisonous elements, and thus removes the cause.

The Blasting of Flood Hock. Hell Bate, New Fork Harbour, October 10, 1885,

A Melbourne newspaper, which ought to
know better, refers to Deniehy’s sketch, “How I
became Attorney-General of Barataria,” as the
work of Sir James Martin. There was never the
least pretension put forth by Martin or Forster
(to whom, also, the authorship has been ascribed)
to the paternity of that brilliant piece of satire;
and Deniehy was recognised as the author in
London literary and legal circles in the early
sixties. Dailey introduced Deniehy to G. B.
Barton,on the last-named’s return from England,
and Barton, as related by Deniehy himself in a
letter to his wife, delighted the little man by an
account of the impression made by the sketch on
members of the Temple.
The latest Victorian wreck, that of the
Fiji, occurred only 10 miles from that of the Loch
Ard, in 1878 —the latter one of the most unlucky
ships that ever sailed. On her first voyage she
came into Hobson’s Bay with two other ships,
the John Kerr|[and the Can.b.idgc shire, all three
dismasted. Next voyage, the Loch Ard was all
but lost on the Otway leeshore, hanging by her
anchors, through a fearful storm all night, and the
third voyage she was wrecked, when young Tom
Pearce, a midshipman, saved a passenger, Miss
Eva Carmichael, whereupon all Australia gushed,
though the lady weighed 12st. Capt. Robertson,
leaving the Loch Ard, perished with a number of
other captains in a Calcutta epidemic.
Scarcely has one appalling disaster on
Victorian waters been placed on record than
another of a no less awful character is announced.
The victims of the Gambier-Easby colli Jon are
hardly laid in their graves (where such has been
possible) when we have another shock in regard
to the ill-fated Fiji. It seems that this sea-
travelling is getting about as unsafe as a Yankee
railway, and if things go on as they are doing the
life-insurance people will refuse to take risks over
marine accidents at all. There are some people
who delight in “ being prepared,” as they call it,
by having their lives insured. They know then
that when they kick the slop-receptacle their
relicts will be in a position to set up some other
poor devil and start a fresh family upon the pro-
ceeds of their misfortune. Some otheis, however,
take a less happy view of the case, and prefer to
have the “stuff” in their pockets and take the
risk, with the necessary precautions for safety.
And, as a rule, they’re just as happy as the others,
and enjoy life, too. But these people are sensible
in one way—they always get even with the risk as
much as they can. So in regard to these ship
wrecks you generally find that the Insurance-
companies are struck by the poor wretches who
go down, but the others are more frequently
the ones who have nothing to gain for
themselves or their families by going under,
and they swim ashore. They nearly all swim—
these people. And after all don’t they insure
themselves in the best way? We gave an instance
last week of a man who saved himself from the
Easby through having learned to swim at the
Sydney Natatorium in Pitt-street, and it would
be an interesting thing to know how many others
were in the same category. In any case, this
institution has turned out a power of swimmers,
and you can’t tell how many others there were on
the Fiji and the Gambier who may attribute their
present existence to the fact that they learned the
natatory art at the Natatorium. As we have
previously pointed out, the baths there are very
fine, and now that the warm weather is creeping
on they ai-e becoming quite crowded again. For
the benefit of those who have never attended, we
may say that the Natatorium is in Pitt-street
near the Haymarket, and that the Hotel and
Baths form one of the most attractive sights of
the locality.

The Bulletin learns with regret that Judge
Foster’s illness is not only serious, but is
likely to amount to a permanent disablement.
During his three or four years’ service on the
Supreme Court bench (New South Wales) —he
was appointed in February, 1888—his Honor
has shown himself to be a conscientious, upright
and painstaking servant of the public. We
make this acknowledgment without departing
from the opinion we have always held, that he
is seriously lacking in the qualifications that
ought to be found in the holder of high magis-
terial office. We are altogether opposed to the
principle which regulates the selection of
Supreme Court Judges in New South Wales,
and more or less in every Australian province.
It is a vicious rule which bestows upon
the Attorney-General, for the time being,
a sort of prescriptive claim to any judge-
ship which may become vacant during his
term of office. ” Rumour goes that if Judge
Foster retires, his place will be taken by
Attorney-General Simpson. If Mr. Simpson is
the best man for the position, we have no objec-
tion. The fact that he is a colleague of Sir Henry
Parkes doesn’t prejudice him in our eyes as a
candidate for a judgeship. But urn insist that
that fact has no right to be treated as giving
him a claim to the appointment. It has no
right to be even taken into account as an
element in the question. If Mr. G. B. Simpson
has displayed judicial qualifications which point
him out as the fittest available man for the
post, and if his health is good enough to war-
rant the expectation that he will do fifteen
years’ good -work ere claiming his pension, then
he is entitled to it. But not otherwise.
* * *
There is another consideration that enters
into the case, one that derives special emphasis
from Mr. Justice Foster’s illness now. The
New South Wales Supreme Court Judges are
appointed at a salary of £2600 a-year, with an
annual pension of seven-tenths of that amount
on retirement, after fifteen years service, or on
permanent disability or infirmity. In view of
the fact that this pension is a tax on the public,
the public is entitled to some assurance at the
time of his nomination that he is not likely to
become a pensioner until he has done a fair
amount of service. A satisfactory medical
certificate should be an indispensable condition
of any man’s appointment to a post to which a
pension is attached. We sincerely trust, for
Judge Foster’s sake, that his indisposition has
been over-rated, and that a few months rest
will restore him to health and enable him to
resume his duties. But if he should un-
fortunately be compelled to retire, his account
with the public of New South Wales will stand
this way Credit; Three-and-a-half years’
work. Debit: £9lOO cash, and a pension of
£lB2O for life. Such a balance-sheet must be
as unsatisfactory to a man of Judge loster s
strict conscientiousness, as it most certainly is
to the tax-paying community.
* * *
Why should young men not be appointed to
the Bench ? The duties discharged by a Supreme
Court Judge require not only a knowledge of
the law—they require a clear, vigorous intellect
and a sound physical constitution. Mental
exhaustion and physical fatigue on the Bench
infallibly mean injustice to suitors. If a level-
headed man in the prime of life, with an
active intelligence, is not competent to acquit
himself creditably as a Judge after, say, 10 years
constant practice at the Bar, he probably never
will be. So far as difficult points of law are con-
cerned, as a rule both sides of the question are
put before him fully by the contending parties.
If he has any serious doubt upon the matter, he
can consult his brother Judges. That is done
now by the present Judges every day. As
proof that young men can perform judicial
functions satisfactorily, we have only to look at
the District Court. No one will pretend that
the best men there are the oldest. Physical
and intellectual sanity count for infinitely more
than long experience. And, speaking of the
District Court, why should not men who have
proved their mettle there be raised to the bench
of the higher court? What is the matter
with a man like District Court Judge
Backhouse that when a Supreme Court
Judge is wanted he should be passed
over, and the billet be given to some elderly
gentleman, who is getting too lazy for the
active duties of his profession as an advocate ?
The Bulletin is dead against the time-honoured
principle of keeping judgeships as havens of
dignified retirement for men who have out-
grown their capacity for hard work. Time-
honoured principles are generally weatherworn
and unseaworthy. When the public offer a
good salary and a pension for the performance
of given duties, their object is not to bestow
charity, but to get work done; and they are
entitled to get men fit to do the work.
The plates of the cruisers which have Jesst
been sent us by good old Hingland are exactly

About the biggest and easiest-got haul
made by a Chinaman on the Palmer, was made
from Jack M'Lean, now a squatter on the
Mitchell River. In the early days McLean was
butchering at Limestone, and the money came in
at such a rate as to necessitate frequent trips to
the bank at Maytown. On one occasion he
packed something over seven hundred ounces of
gold into a valise, which he put on a led horse.
After riding some miles he chanced to look
behind him, and, to his horror, discovered that
the valise was missing. He didn’t wait to swap
knives or swear, but started on the back track at
a Melbourne Cup rate. After riding some three
or four miles he found the valise all safe and
sound, but the gold had gone! The road swarmed
with Chinamen, and all McLean could get out of
them was “no savee.” It was afterwards ascer-
tained, beyond a doubt, that a Chinaman found
the valise soon after McLean had passed, took out
the gold and sailed for China by the first vessel
from Cooktown. Jack has ever since, and ever
will be, hopelessly soured against the Chinkie
race.

W. E. Abbott says he is no party man,
but will denounce the squatters as readily as any
others if it should seem necessary. “If it should
seem necessary.”
The late “Dick” Thatcher used to tel 1
this yarn. A Sydney man once gave a garden-
party at his suburban residence which was at-
tended by all the bon ton. Just as the last of the
guests were arriving a frowsy, downheeled loafer
ambled up the gravel walk and, eyeingthe company
with a deprecating look, sidled up to the host who
was on the verandah. Removing his battered
tile and making a low bow he asked : “Would
you like to hear a d d good comic song I
“No,” said the astonished host, “ what right have
you to come here? Don’t you see this ;s a private
party.” “Oh, that’s all right, guv’nor,’ replied
the dead-beat, “if you wouldn't like a good comic
song’ perhaps 3011 would like a good old step-
dance?” “No,” said the indignant host, ‘damn
you and your comic songs and dances I have
told you alreadv that you have no right to come
here,” and he took hold of the sundowner to put
him out. The guests crowded up to see what was
the matter, and the loafer turning round to them
said; “Ladies and Gentlemen, I’ve come here
thinking I could amuse some of you, but it appears
the boss don’t want no comic songs nor step-
dances. Well would any of you like to see the
DEVIL ? ” There was a pause, and then a demure
girl said timidly, “Yes, I would.” “Well, go to
h 1 then,” said the frowsy one, as he sped
down the gravel walk and nearly broke himself in
two getting through the gate.
At Manchester (Eng.) the other day,
James Healy was charged with bigamy, and
defended himself on the plea that his first wife
had disappeared for eight years, in consequence
of which unexpected scarceness on her part he had
set her down as a deceased female, and had married
again. Then the Judge informed Healy that if he
could swear to that circumstance and produce any
evidence to support his statement he could be
found not guilty, and Healy undertook to swear
and produce the evidence, and started in a
blindly confident way for the witness-box. He
was hurriedly shunted back, and told that as a
prisoner he couldn’t go into the witness-box.
Thereupon he wanted to swear in the dock instead,
but he was informed that he couldn’t swear in the
dock—it wasn’t allowed. Then he asked the Judge
where he could swear and give his evidence, and
was informed in reply that he couldn’t swear or
give his evidence anywhere; and when he
demanded why the plaintiff had been heard if the
defendant couldn’t be heard also, it was explained
to him that the British Constitution was arranged
that way. He got excited at this, and enquired
if the court called that justice, and the court said
it didn’t know, and sent Healy up for nine months.
And as the policeman hauled him away the J udge
stated in a consoling way that perhaps the Law
would be altered shortly, and the prisoner res-
ponded as he vanished into the regions below that
it would be darned little use to him if it was.

It is said that the German Emperor suffers
such intense agony at times from his chronic ear-
affection that he has to be largely dosed with
morphia besides having to submit to severe local
treatment. Finding that the illustrious sufferer
was beginning to weaken under this treatment,
his doctor allowed him a certain quantity of
Bavarian beer, which had been interdicted for
some time. His Majesty, who it is said is some-
what partial to this tipple, took advantage of the
permission to indulge in it to such an extent that
something approaching D.T. was the result. He
—so ’tis averred —dressed himself' in British
Admiral’s costume, held a religions service
at 1 a.m., and then went on the bridge of the
Hohenzollern, and insisted on navigating the
ship himself, to the imminent danger of the vessel
and all on board. Feeling the risk, a young officer
presumed to warn His Majesty, whereupon
Wilhelm boxed his ears. The officer went im-
mediately to his cabin and shot himself dead.
Continuing his vagaries on the bridge the Emperor
at last became giddy, or something, and came a
heavy cropper on to the deck, injuring himself so
much that he was not for some time able to go
about at all. This, says the Agence Libre, is the
“slight accident” which the inspired press has
minimised.
Wragge, Queensland meteorologist and
weather-prophet, when he is at home is one of the
sights of Brisbane. He is an absent-minded
skeleton in a slop suit, and always looks as if he
had mislaid himself and couldn’t remember where
he did it. He is pretty safe around Brisbane for
somebody always finds him and takes him home,
but when he visits Sydney he is generally accom-
panied by a small, Hebraic-looking gentleman
whom he calls his “chum,” and this individual
takes care of him. When Wragge stops right in
front of a tram-car to calculate the perihelion of a
comet, or hails an omnibus and then forgets to get
in because he wants to make an estimate of the
probable weather in the next 24 hours, the
“ chum ” seizes him by the back of the pants—he
can’t reach any higher—and dashes him into a
place of safety. Also he has to fish the naked
astronomer out of baths, for Wragge will stand
for four hours under the shower trying to arrive
at the density of Jupiter, or he will camp with
one leg on a railway platform and the other in an
express train that is two hours overdue and howl-
ing to get away, and there become entirely
oblivious. He is a profoundly learned man with
odd boots, and if he were on his way to see an
eclipse he would run over a Governor and tread
him into the mud and never turn a hair.

Without a doubt the field for the Metropolitan
this year was the worst that ever faced a starter for an
event of such importance, and, Highborn and Sunshine
taken away, there was not a horse in it good enough to
win an ordinary handicap. Joe Barton had next thing to
a certainty for Muriel had he elected to start her, and,
perhaps, after the Melbourne Cup he will be of opinion
that a bird in hand is worth a flock in the bush.

The Newcastle crowd had a good win on

if Mr. Wallace liked he would run Carbine a mile, winner
to take the two horses and a substantial stake.

The recent performances of Hero, the aged son
of The Drummer and Camelia, make one wonder how a
horse of his calibre could have reached such an age with-
out earning a winning bracket. As a matter of fact, Hero
was an early foal and although he figures as an aged horse
in the Stud Book, he is in reality only six years old.
When a three-year-old he was cast in his box and was
thrown out of work, but he hears no lasting memento of
the mishap, barring a blemish on a hind leg.

The Olympic Club, Larry Foley’s show, has
cabled an offer of £2OOO for a finish fight between Prit-

away with the big duffer Jem Smith, but that is not much

Fitzsimmons has height and cleverness on his side, and it
remains to be seen who has the hitting power. Should
the pair meet, and Fitzsimmons be still leading his old
steady and abstemious life, he will need a tremendous lot
of thrashing.

distance dive with 65 yards. About 1000 people were
present.

Mr. “Billy” Macpherson, the champion ama-
teur, gave another wonderful performance at Sydney
Grammar School sports on Saturday week, when he won
the ex-students’ 150yds. in time given by two watches as
14 9-10 sec., and by a third as 15 l-ssec. The Association
Ground people ought to endeavour to bring about a meet-
ing between the crack amateur and one of the best pro-
fessionals in a series of races. It would be an interesting
affair, and there is “ millions in it.”

W. H. Croker, lawyer, V.R.C. president, had a
successful point to point steeplechase on his beautiful
Woodlands estate last week. Woodlands is the former
seat of the Greene family. Chief Justice Stawell was
married there, also winning a steeplechase at Woodlands,
with Sir Redmond Barry as judge !

Good, old-fashioned axemanship-contests re-
viving on the Zeehan silver-fields. The other day Watt
beat Cleary for £4O, chopping a 2ft. standing log through
in 7min. 46sec., Cleary having about 6in. still to get
through. Watt has challenged alleged champion Dun-
canson.

A policeman at Southport (Eng.) lately arrested
a cyclist for furious riding, and swore that the captured
wheelman was travelling at the rate of 40 miles an hour.
He would probably have sworn just as cheerfully that he
was doing 800 miles a minute if the case had required it.
A policeman swears with such tremendous velocity that
his ideas of speed get confused.

A Parliamentary return shows in N.S.W. that,
during the last twelve months, no fewer than 357,317
letters were registered addressed to owners or agents of
betting-houses, and during the same period 1,796,585
letters passed through the post addressed to owners of
recognised betting-houses. In the year 1890, the sum of
£431,500 was advertised in the Sydney papers in gambling,
sweeps, whilst in 1891 the amount had risen to £670,000.

Choynski on his return to California will be

When Tom Curran was lately promoting a
testimonial to N.S.W. Postmaster-General Dan. O’Connor,
on the latter’s rejection by two constituencies, Larry
Foley—grateful for Dan’s patronage—called the pugs,
together, and proposed that they should scrap for the
benefit of the Jaynial Dan. The scrap didn’t come off.
But it only shows what indignities, in the guise of well-
meant offerings of practical friendship, may be levelled at
the deserving politician.

W. A. E. Slocombe, of Sydney, who has won
every handicap he has lately competed for, and never
missed a bird, appears to be close up champion pigeon-
shot of Australia. Dr. Carver and he were to have shot
a match shortly for £2OO a-side, but since the match
between Carver and L Clarke, of Melbourne (when the
Dr. was ddjreitod by his opponent by one bird—Clarke
shooting 92—5 n running without a miss to the Doctor’s
91j, the umttMi has been declared off, Slocombe, in a most
sportsmanlike and liberal wav, declining to annex the
Doctor's'£so deposit. ‘Slocombe and Clarke, who are to
shoot a deciding match, would make a very hot pair to
turn up at Hnrlingham or Monte Carlo.
Mr. Jack Want and party have backed The

A balance-sheet, lately issued by the “ Sowth ”
Melbourne Football Club, contains an awful mass of food
for reflection. The twenty wild untutored heroes of that
team cost £3O per head for a few days’ trip to Queensland.
They have consumed £325 in “ trophies ” during the
season, and been photographed all over the shop to the
tune of £133. This last is, perhaps, the saddest item of
them all. The fact that there are barrackers willing to
pay a shilling or two for a group photograph of the
glorious Sowth, can be defended on the’ground that the
shilling might be worse spent in getting drunk. But for
a secretary to scatter these souvenirs gratis over the fair
surface of Australia, as examples for the young, and in
the interests of society at large, is an appalling demon-
stration of football’s faith in itself. Another dishearten-
ing circumstance sticks out from this balance-sheet.
From a total club expenditure of £2462, the umpires—
the real heroes, who carry their lives in their hands, and
have to face sufficient blasphemy to kill a bullock—have
received ten pounds nineteen shillings. They haven’t
even the additional solace of being immortalised in the
£133 worth of photographs. This seems an oversight.
The umpire should always be specially grouped beside
the ball, as another object who does not know when to
expect the next kick.

The Tasmanian-bred horse Caledonian made a
show of his field in the Steeplechase at Randwick on
Saturday, as going to the front from the jump he was
never approached and won by over a furlong. He has
only one eye, but fenced faultlessly, and pulled up after
the race apparently as fresh as when he started.
* « #
Megaphone proved an efficient substitute for
his illustrious mate, Carbine, at Randwick. He galloped
over Melos in the Randwick Plate, and should have a big
say in the Melbourne Cup. Apropos, sight should not be
lost of Cobham. No horse during the meeting showed
greater improvement, and, with 7st. 111 b., he should
have more than an outside Cup show.
* # #
Taking the A.J.O. meeting all through, the
“ punters” must have had a bit the best of the deal, but
the last day proved a regular picnic for them, as only one
first favourite failed to get home.
* * *
Marvel again showed his superfine quality on
the final day of the A.J.O. meeting, by winning the
Waverley Handicap w'th lOst. 51b. up, in the remarkably
good time of 3min. Csec. for the mile and three-quarters ;
and several watches made him carve out the last mile in
a little over 1.43.
* * *
Rumoured that Melos broke down after Rand-
wick Plate. If so, hard luck for Mr. Gannon, as Raynor
had the old horse very well.
* * *
The sensational Bungebah promises to start a
big favourite for the Caulfield Cup, and if Raynor only
has him as well as when he pulled off the Newmarket, the
race looks a foregone conclusion for him.

MERELY THE
TRUTH.
They have merit.
The fact is indisputable.
The proof lies in the free samples.
It is not enough to say they sometimes fail.
They are of human produce, and therefore fallible.
The real facts are—
Do they cure diseases of the blood and skin in the majority of in-
stances? Undoubtedly they do.
Do they undo the effect of a chill or congestion, by bringing about
normal conditions of health ? Yes, they loosen and disperse the congestion.
Do they permeate the blood aseptically, so that bacilli and germs
cannot multiply and the growth of disease is checked ? Yes, they do.
Do they confer relief, assuage pain, and benefit the general health,
even when they do not cure ? Invariably, yes.
Do they act as a natural healthy laxative, rendering them especially
valuable to women and children, and to men of sedentary habits of life or
business 1 Yes, by tonic action only.
Do they free the inner skin pores and intricacies from taint, clearing
off eruptions and improving the complexion 1 They do.
Does their palatable taste and safety render them pre-eminently a
family medicine ? Yes, for neither the mind nor stomach rebels against
them, and children like them.
Are they the best of all blood purifiers and the most valuable of all
spring cleansing medicines ? Yes, they are.

attention to a new device for preventing draughts
in railway carriages by “simply making the
inside widow lean to the outside at the top when
put up.” The spectacle of a widow—probably
with nine small children—leaning over at the top
when put up is too harrowing for comment. The
same paper also tells of a man who died leaving
U, window and family unprovided for, which is
another harrowing item, and calculated to draw
tears from a east-iron stove.
Blogging has been initiated in the Northern
Territory. The first to taste the public castigator
was, of course, a Chinaman. His crime was a
horrible one—an unnatural offence on a European
child five years old, whom he Was supposed to
nurse. Government Resident Knight, acting as
Judge, sent him up for five years and ordered 33
lashes along With it. Mothers in the Far North
are now seriously considering whether it isn’t
better to employ nurse-girls instead of Chinese
boys. Years ago another Chine e nurse was
proved to be a lep°r after he had been in his posi-
tion for several years.
Joseph Palmer, sharebroker. Foreign-
trader, boss Baptist, anti-gambling apostle, and
stock-exchange magnate, Writes to Sydney D.T.
about the unnaturally slow increase of population
in Canada, and finishes up thus ;
This is not surprising, hut is the natural result of two
great Calamities which have befallen Canada during the
fast id years. The calamities to which I refer are Pro-
tection and Federation.
Good old Foreign-trad 3 argument ! And the
decadence of Ireland, where the population,
instead of increasing slowly, has decreased 59 per
cent., is caused, We presume, by Freatrade and
the Want of Federation, that unhappy island
having been swallowed instead of federated. And
the pitiably slow progress of West Australia under
the old Imperial Foreign-trade regime, is owing,
we should imagine, to the same cause. And the
loss of half the population of the Scotch High-
lands comes, We should think, into the same cate-
gory. And, worst disaster of all, Joseph Palmer
himself seems to arise from Froetrale, and the
dismal sounds that issue from his head arc very
solemn things to listen to.
LITTLE OF THE GUN; NOTHING OF
THE DOG.
When Rip Van Winkle awoke from his nap in
the Gatskill Mountains in America, he found him-
self an old man. His dog was dead long ago, and
nothing was left of ins gun but the lock and
barrel. And when he went back to the village of
Falling Water, where he used to live, nobody
recognised him. His wife, believing him dead,
had married an innkeeper. Right enough too,
for Rip had lain on the mountain-side, sound
asleep, for twenty years.
A long snooze ; but it seems to me I’d rather be
asleep half my life at a stretch than to stop awake
and be miserable. Yet here is a woman who s iys,
“I can truthfully say that for eighteen years I
was never free from pain for a single day.”
Mercy! think of that. What a Wretchol Way
to live! Yet I suppose millions of folk crawl
along through the world in that style. Not be-
cause they want to. Heavens, no ! But because
they can’t help it. This was her situ ition, and
an army of other Women (besides crowds of men)
can sympathise with her.
She says : “For over twenty years I was weak
and sickly. At first I had a bad taste in the
mouth, poor appetite, and an uncomfortable feel-
ing at my chest and sides, and often tried to
obtain ease by holding my sides with my hands.
After eating I had great pain ; it was like a load
at my chest, and I could not bear it until I
vomited all my food up. I would be quite faint
from the want of food but was amid to cat. At
times I had bad attacks of spasms which nearly
doubled me up, and I rambled up and down the
house for hours together, for I could not even lie
down. Of course I lost a deal of sleep, and in a
morning was so weak and faint I scarcely knew
how to get cut of bed and downstairs. For
eighteen years I teas never free from pain for a
single day.
“ I saw doctor after do tor, and took a great
quantity of medicine without finding any real
relief. They would not say what was the cause of
my ailment. I was fast wasting a\> ly, and did
not think I could live much longer, wlo.n one day
in 1881 my husband heard from Mr. Joseph
Cooper, of Bourne, of a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, which he said had cured
him. ‘IfI am spared,’ I said to ray husband, ‘ I
will try it.’ I did so, and before I had taken the
first bottle I found relief, and after taking four
bottles more I was quite well and strong.
“ That is now ten years ago, and 1 have been in
good health ever since, taking just an occasional
dose of the syrup. After my recovery the clergy-
man said to my husband, “Your missis gets
about very different to what she used to do,’and
he told him that Mother Seigel’s Syrup had
wrought the cure. People tell me I look better
than I did twenty years ago, and I feel so strong
that I can now dig potatoes and do work with
anyone, notwithstanding I am 65 years of age.
“ My husband suffered terribly from rheuma-
tism and flux, and has found wonderful benefit
from the same medicine. He says he would have
been in the churchyard long ago but for Mother
Seigel’s Syrup. For myself, I can say it saved my
life, and I wish others to know what it has done
for me and mine. (Signed) Mrs. Esther Ayr,
wife of William Ayr, of Thurlby, near Bourne,
Lincolnshire.”
In this brief and simple way Mrs. Ayr tells a
story the full details of which would fill a book.
What hopes and fears ! what hours of keen sorrow
and deep darkness she must have experienced.
Yes, indeed. None can even imagine it except
those who belong to the great Sisterhood of Suffer-
ing. Where she mentions one symptom of her
disease she actually could have named a dozen.
For her malady—tiie fearfully common and fatal
one, indigestion and dyspepsia—has as many signs
and forms as the mind has fancies, or the heavens
have clouds. From it, as from sin, come a. thou-
sand pangs and pains to torment and to crush
helpless humanity.' Seeing what her great dis-
covery has accomplished in this and multitudes of
like eases, how good a friend to her kind was
Mother Seigel ! Rip Van Winkle awoke from his
nap to find himself old ; Mrs. Ayr awoke from her
long night of illness to find herself young again.
Is not the moral plain enough for all the suffering
millions in England?

Gov. Kintore on the Northern Territory.
Dear Bulletin,—Referring to your remarks re
Governor Kintore’s impudent assertion that
coloured labour is essential in the Northern
Territory of S.A., I think a short explanation
might not be out of place. Gov. Kintore wrote
(I quote from memory) that, if the Chinese were
taken away, the Palmerston (Port Darwin) resi-
dent would be left without servants, gardeners,
fishermen, laundries, tailors, etc. This statement,
while true in fact, is utterly misleading. The
general reader accepts Palmerston as the ordinary
Australian township with which we are all
familiar, whereas it is not, nor has it ever been,
anything of the sort. Palmerston, from the start,
was nothing more than a group of Government
officials living on the point of land that juts into
the harbour. There was, and is, a Government
Resident, living in a residency —a kind of
governor on a small scale ; a police-magistrate,
an inspector of police, and several troopers. The
inspector of the northern portion of the overland
line and his numerous staff reside there ; also the
representative of the Gable Company and his staff,
a chief surveyor and his staff, &c., &c. These
- formed for years the main elements of the place.
The Cable Co.’s officials, coming as they did from
Singapore and other eastern stations, and accus-
tomed to coloured service, went in for Chinese
cooks, &c., and, as a matter of course, the other
officials followed suit. The Chinese were cheap,
there were no white men to protest against their
employment, and a Chinese colony at once settled
down and monopolised whatever trade there was
going. The unfortunate premature rush to the
goldfields, which did the Territory so much harm,
was another attraction to the Chinese, who, on
the return of the disappointed miners, took up
the abandoned ground. The European store-
keepers and hotel-keepers, who settled in the
place as time went on, fell into the ways of the
town, and employed all Chinese servants for their
households. None but Chinese cooks were em-
ployed on the different stations on the overland
line. It will thus be seen that the formation of
Palmerston, and that of the many North Queens-
land towns in the same latitude, was, and is,
essentially different. The Queenslanders formed
their ports where needed, as convenient outlets for
pastoral and mining industries. What few
Government officials were considered necessary
followed the small nucleus of population, and did
not precede it. One police-magistrate did the
work for a far larger area than that under the
control of a resident, a P.M., and a police-
inspector in the Territory. The Queensland
lawns have grown into prosperous centres;
Palmerston, official and Chinese - ridden, has
lingered and languished. Governor Kintore
asserts that to banish the Chinese would deprive
the residents of domestic servants, gardeners,
&c.; and so it would until they got white servants
in their stead, and no longer. There are no white
servants in the place now simply because the
Chinaman leaves no room for them. The absurd
statement that Chinese labour is necessary to open
the country is palpably false. When Europeans
can work in Cairns, on Charters Towers, and on
the Etheridge they can work in the Territory.
Governor Kintore saw nothing of the Territory to
enable him to foim an independent, personal
judgment. He landed at Port Darwin, was feted
by the Chinese merchants who have sent thousands
out of the country, and are anxious to send thou-
sands more; he travelled down along the main
road that follows the telegraph-line, and was
posted up in partial statements by the
officials who form the local aristocracy. Of
the tableland country between the line and the
Georgina in Queensland, destined to be a great
sheep-raising district in the future, he saw no-
thing; of the country to the westward he saw
nothing. Ho simply saw the overland line—
Palmerston, and the little clique there, and it
cut him to the heart that they should be deprived
of their Chinese servants. As evincing any know-
ledge of the Territory, or its resources, the report
is a farce. As an official and authoritative state-
ment, which may lead to complications with the
English Government, who still retain a kind of
shadowy claim over the Territory, it is a dan-
gerous document. The Governor of South Aus-
tralia has gone beyond his province altogether.
He has made himself the mouthpiece and trumpet-
blower of prospective syndicates and land-boomers,
and in a matter that closely affects the whole of
Australia; for so long as the back door of Port
Darwin is open we may close all the front doors
against the Chinese in vain. In spite of Gov. Kin-
tore, if Palmerston has to rely for its future progress
upon the Chinese it will always remain what it is
now — a settlement of officials, and a Chinese
quarter vegetating amongst a lot of vacant allot-
ments owned by absentees. _

Government Statist Coghlan reports that

The N.S.W. Premier lately informed
Houghton, M.P., that if he will submit some
reliable and tangible information relative to the
registry-office scandals the Government will be
prepared to move in the matter. Some of the
required data could be obtained from the N.S.W.
Railway Department. Two years ago it was the
practice to issue free passes to the unemployed,
and one ingenious labour-agent used to procure
them for his victims to go to such far-distant
places as Tenterlield, Albury. and Bourke, in the
sure and certain hope that they would never
return. Of course he provided them with mythical
situations and took their half-sovereigns with a
sympathetic sigh.
George Francis Train lays it down as an
axiom that cranks are always moral, but if we
accept this ruling, then a large number of alleged
Australian cranks are put right out of court.
Train’s contention, however, is supported by any
amount of negative evidence. The methodical
profligate is generally “orthodox” in his politics,
and a cynical advocate of moderation. Your
money-making rogue is the antithesis of the crank,
and no first-class usurer ever had a bee in his bell-
topper. In inferior criminal society, too, the term
applied to any half-starving fellow who refuses to
mix with the “ boys ’’—is “crank.” And the fact
that the so-called musical or artistic crank is apt
to be loose in his morals, goes to prove that his
crankiness is merely a trick of the trade.
THE FOSTER BREWING COMPANY
LIMITED, MELBOURNE.
Whatever the great International Exhibition of
1888-9 may have cost the Victorian Government
it has undoubtedly proved a pronounced success
in introducing to Melbourne many protective
industries which, under ordinary circumstances
would not for some years at least have been
established. One of the most pronounced indus-
tries in this respect is the Foster Brewing Co.
Limited, situated at Collingwood, Melbourne, and
close to the Victoria Parade. The building
is built of red brick, two storeys in height,
and has a large frontage to Rokeby - street.
Such is the brewery in its present form. The old
building, however, was of much smaller dimen-
sions, but, nevertheless, the plant and effects were
sufficiently good to brew the celebrated Foster
Lager Beer which secured in competition with the
world the highest award at the Melbourne Cen-
tennial Exhibition of 1888-9. This successful issue
was brought about by Messrs. Foster Brothers
two enterprising Americans who afterwards
formed the business into the Foster Brewing Co.
Limited, and with what success we will endeavour
to describe. Their first step was to erect the
building at present in use, and to secure the best
and latest improved machinery adapted to brew-
ing lager beer as a speciality. In brewing lager
beer it is well known that the process is reversed
as compared witli the usual method adopted in the
manufacture of Australian beer or English ale.
The “ Lager” can only be produced by preserving
a low temperature, and in order to obtain this
some very special machinery is used by the Foster
Co. This is first noticeable in a 60 h.p. bi-valve
engine for freezing purposes, and connected with
a 12-ton ice-machine. This engine bears the
manufacturing name, J. S. Schwalbk and Solm,
Germania, and in the machinery court was one of
the features of the Centennial Exhibition. There
is a second engine 45 h.p., by the Pictet Ice Co.
of New York, to which another ice-machine is
attached. These two important factors supply all
the refrigerating requirements in connection with
the brewery. In consequence of having to
“ refrigerate ” the principal rooms of the building
it combines a twofold advantage, serving, its pur-
pose in reducing the temperature for brewing and
also producing ice which is sold throughout Mel-
bourne as a marketable commodity. The ice-
tanks are contained in the refrigerating rooms, and
within the tanks are square galvanised iron cells
each capable of holding of ice. These cells
are built in sections which are lifted out by means
of a small steam crane, and by applying warm
water the ice-blocks are “thawed” out of the
cells which are refilled by means of an elevated
syphon fixed on a roller bar. In another
room, still on a par with the temperature
of the Arctic regions—six freezing tanks are
in use for the manufacture of crystal ice,
whicli is considered to be a better article
than the ordinary ice block. The “Crystal”
block is the outcome of a freezing process much
slower than usual, but in 48 hours is perfected in
J-cwt. mould blocks. Next to the various freezing
rooms we visit the large ice store, capable of
storing 80 to ICO tons, which is kept in its beauti-
ful state of “coldness” owing to a crystalized
“ brine,” which is driven into the ice store from
the refrigerating room by means of a Blake pump.
There are nine of these Blake pumps used on the
premises. The main cellar, where the bulk lager
beer is stored, is kept at freezing point by means
of the salt water brine, which assumes a crystaline
form, the same as that used in the ice store and
most other portions of the building.
The brewing department comes next. One of
the principal features of the brewing is the
“mash,” and here Mr. Peska explained the
different degrees of temperature as between the
lager brew and that of ordinary colonial ales.
Colonial ale while in the “mash” begins at a
temperature of 175 deg. Fab. and finishes at ICO to
162 Fall., while the lager in process of “mash”
starts at 50 to 60 deg. Fah., and finishes at from
160 to 162 deg. Fah. Thus it is that the soluble
albuminous matter can only le obtained at a
very low temperature and increases very slowly,
while at a temperature of 160 to 162 deg. all
starch and extraneous substances are extracted.
Only the best brewing material is used by the
Foster Brewing Co. Bohemian hops of the
first quality and specially-prepared Australian
malt of a very pale colour. The large steam
copper boiler is another feature of the establish-
ment. It is built on the principle adopted by the
lager beer breweries of Copenhagen, which in point
of completeness excel those of Germany and
America. The top floor of the brewery is used as
a cooling-room and contains an enormous shallow
iron tank for exposing the beer in order that it
may contract a certain quantity of oxygen from
the air to further aid good fermentation, and so
that all insoluble matter may fall to the bottom
and thereby leave as near as possible a nice bright,
brilliant “warb.” The liquor then runs from
the cooler to the refrigerating tubes filled with
iced-water for the purpose of reducing the
high temperature to a degree for fermentation.
Probably the most interesting feature of this large
establishment is the special cultivation of abso-
lutely pure yeast by one of Dr. Hansen’s patent
machines of Copenhagen. The germ is imported
perfectly pure in sterile bottles and in most
minute particles; it is specially selected for
tropical climates, is absolutely proof against bac-
teria and deleterious matter, and is made m a
Melbourne laboratory specially for the roster
Brewing Co., Limited. The fermenting-room is
exceptionally large. It contains 14 vats, each ya
holding one brew of 80 hhds. The fermentation
takes place very slowly, and the yeast sinks o
the bottom ; in the ordinary course of brewing
this is reversed, the yeast rising to the top. J n
second fermentation takes place in the cel a ,
which has great storage capacity. It conuu
numerous large casks capable of holding /00 to
gals, each ; from these casks the liquor is pumpe
through a patent filter into the boiling-room, an
is there finished off for commercial uses. ■*-
premises fairly bristle with cleanliness—a gr®
secret in the management of an imports
brewery. All the floors are washed . oufc , a hv
scrubbed weekly. The export trade enjoyed
the Foster Brewing Co., Limited, is very la g
throughout Austialasia, and their a^er , /,
acknowledged to be the best value in the mark >
it has gained a meritorious mention wherever it
been tried, besides the price is so reasonable a
come within reach of most ordinary beer-drink

Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 188 S.
To H. F. Kuqelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that lime took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest,
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away' until
J became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
romited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
