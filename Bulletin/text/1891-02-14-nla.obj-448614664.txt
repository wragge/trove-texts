This Blacking is in liquid form and is applied to shoes
or other articles of leather by means of a sponge, attached
to the cork by a wire, so that the blacking can be used by
anyone without soiling the lingers. No polishing brush
is required. It dries immediately after being applied, and
will not soil the most delicate clothing.

SPECIALIST for tlie Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical Bowl of N.S. W. Lute House Sur-
geon to the Great Northern Hospital. London
I am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
Of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the tieatm-nt.of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified 91 on in the treatment of
.Clirpnlc and Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
gersons- The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
eld in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph, No\ v .
,6th 7th and Bth, 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified .lion entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from these disease*, who are scattered over all parts qf
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertised.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not only
Strike a blow at the Quackery which now exists, but T also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity.
Wr Qnallfleallons I Invite the fullest investieatlon Into. For some considerable time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities ot observin ; the many phases of the Nervous and
Sexua System, and to be oine acquainted with the most scientific methods of effecting their cure. ...
' Mv sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me lie is informed at the
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
If I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete autl Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of those diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chiet
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading college*
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualification*
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi?
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

sanity and death, should consult him, for he ha*
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. ia

Showing plainly how all diseases of the private at
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. Thi*
book will prove a valuable companion, and evea
though you bo perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a'letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will bo found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters arc carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their case*
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1891.
Australian Federation.
The time is almost at hand for an effort to
be made towards the solution of the most
momentous problem which, so far, has pre-
sented itself to the Australian people. It is
a problem also which, should no solution or,
worse still, a false one, be supplied, may
mean much heartburning in the former case
and possible disintegration in the latter.
The question is that known as Federation,
and has been before the public in various
rather shadowy forms during the last thirty
years and over. For many reasons —some
rather obscure, while others are attractively
Obvious —a certain prominence has of late
been given to the subject by the action of
Sir Henry Pahkes. At this time of day it
is almost supererogatory to point out that the
N.S.W. Premier tills no humble niche in
that great Pantheon of prestidigitators whose
public lives are guided by two useful rules—
to stick to office like a reef to a Pacific atoll,
and to stamp as their own the ideas of others.
In a political sense these qualities are of the
first order of merit and, in justice to the
Premier, it must be conceded that he
possesses them in excelsis. It can be confi-
dently stated that, if the late Foreign-
trade majority at the N.S.W. general elec-
tion had consisted of thirty instead of three,
or if the principle of Protection to native
industries were not a power in the land, the
question of Federation would still remain in
solution and show no signs of crystallising.
# * *
It may be said that, as intercolonial Free-
trade with Protection against the outside
world would be the obvious result of Federa-
tion, Sir Henry Parses would be merely
signing his own administrative death-warrant
by pressing for the creation of a Congress in
which he and his fiscal followers would be in
a hopeless minority. This seems plausible
enough. But those who adopt such a line
of reasoning are not properly acquainted
with the political dodges that attend on
representative government like a shadow
For instance, the Federation cry, combined
with a proposal to let the fiscal question
alone till the larger one of union was settled,
would be by no means a bad one with which
to face a general election. Again, these
negotiations will necessarily take time, and
time is to Premier Parkes at present as
precious as it was to Sister Anne in the
story, when M. Bluebeard was heard coming
up the stairs for her head Even at the
worst, Sir Henry Parkes in a fiscal minority
in a Federal Congress would have far greater
chances than when in a similar minority in
a local Parliament. Indeed, it is far from
improbable that he would be found at the
head of « fJovevnment which held office
while an economic measure it opposed was
passed, just as in Sydney he remained in
office while the measure for paying members,
towards which he expressed uncompromising
hostility, became law. His action on the
occasion of the rejection of that measure by
the N.S.W. Upper House was probably the
finest piece of what is known in histrionism
as “gag” that was ever witnessed by those
privileged to see it. It showed that if
“ Mister Gladstone ” was his mentor,
Disraeli was his model.
# # *
Federation is of two kinds—good and bad.
Any closer welding of the various Australian
colonies that does not point to a future of
Independence and Republicanism is bad from
the start. The native-born Australians, and
those who have made the world’s largest
island their home, might be classed among
the meanest of men if they saw for that home
nothing beyond a career of perpetual pro-
vincialism. It would be just as sensible to
expect the earth to revolve round the moon,
or Jupiter round one of his satellites, as to
expect a huge island to revolve in political
perpetuity round an islet. It is merely look-
ing for the tail to wag the dog. There is
a name, and by no means a flattering one,
for the man who in private life will not
strike out for himself but prefers to hang to
others’ coat-tails. But no term is too oppro-
brious for the nation which, with a geogra-
phical dot second to none the world over,
calmly makes up its mind to perpetual
subordination. Yet this is the precise
meaning of “Federation under the Crown.”
It means tinsel titles for the vulgar and the
vain ; irritating surveillance by distant aud
foreign officials who never saw nor wished to
sec this great southern land, and, in thp end,
a violent wrench, not unaccompanied per-
haps by bloodshed, when the generation that
came up out of Egypt has passed away to be
succeeded by a more independent and virile
one.
* * *
The primary factor then of a vicious
federation is that of an ignoble future. But
it is not the only one. A union might take
place of a highly objectionable and even
dangerous character, even if independence
were promised either now or at any time
that Australia demanded it. At the very
threshold it may be laid down as axiomatic
that any union which leaves a great question
to be settled by future generations, as the
slavery question was left by the Americans
of a hundred years ago, is perilous. And
it would be a fecund source of future bicker-
ings, or worse, to let five States only instead
of fifty constitute the units of the Australian
Confederation. The Americans were forced
to legalise slavery a century ago, or else split
into warring Republics with the chance of
being re-conquered in detail before the ink
on their charter of freedom was dry. The
world knows how the question of negro
bondage was ultimately settled a generation
since. The question of Australian territory
would in all probability be settled in a
similarly drastic fashion if the mistake of
permitting a continent to be unequally
divided into a small number of States
instead of equally into a large number, was
at the outset. In this readjustment there
need be no difficulty, for Territories could
be erected into States as in America when
an adequate population entitled them to the
promotion.
The chief elements of a sound federation
are (a) that ultimate Independence and Re-
publicanism be the recognised goal ; (6),
that a large number of States and Territories
be carved out of the present provinces, so
that no colony or group of colonies will be
likely to attain undue weight; (c), that the
post of Governor-General be elective, or at
least that the united provinces have an
absolute veto on the British appointment;
(d), that titles and - privileges of all kinds,
except those derived from office, be at once
abolished. There is no reason why a con-
federacy whose foundations were thus laid deep
and strong should not for all time preserve
at least one of the world’s great divisions
from that curse of war which has filled all
other continents with want, and blood, and
tears. But there is every reason to fear that
a league of a less pronounced character, such
a league as in all likelihood will be proposed
at the coming conference, will begin by
tying a knot which a subsequent generation
will have to cut with the sword. More than
ten years elapsed from the declaration of
American independence to the promulgation
of the Constitution, That Constitution has
lasted almost unchanged to the present, and
no shot would ever have been necessary for
its preservation but for the abysmal wrong
of slavery which, introduced by the British,
hung over the land like a pall till, in our own
day, a million men laid down their lives to
lift it. The great men who drafted the
American co-partnership saw r clearly what
the ultimate result of slavery would be, but
they were powerless to avert it. No such
disintegrating question, however, presents
itself to the Australian delegates. They
must create one for themselves, and, ap-
parently, may be trusted to raise a goblin
which by and bye will have to be laid by
force on the Murray or on the Darling.
» # *
We have said that, apart from his penchant
for affixing his own trade-mark to the mental
manufactures of others, Premier Pakkes
foremost characteristic is, like the Vicar of
Bray, to hold office at all hazards. It is
because a careful study of his career has
shown us how all subjects, political and
private, are viewed by him from a purely
personal standpoint—which might be formu-
lated in the words “how can I best bend
them to my profit I”—that wo decline to trust
him in this great question of laying the
foundation-stone of a peaceful and progres-
sive Australian Democracy. It remains to
examine two other facets of the subject
which are of the first importance. They are
(a) what the certain result wquld be to all
Australia outside Victoria, of a federation
of the five continental colonies; and (h) what
the chances of foreign invasion would be in
the event of a Declaration of Independence
either at present or in the near future.
■* * *
It is clear that Federation would be fol-
lowed without delay by continental Freetrade
combined with a stiff tariff on imports.
There are men who affect to deny this, just
as there are those who cannot make up their
minds concerning the earth’s rotundity, but
it is impossible to refrain from doubting the
sincerity of both. With the fiscal parties
balanced in New South Wales, while among
the other partners to the league the pre-
ponderance of Protectionists was overwhelm-
ing, the result admits of no argument.
Owing to the long fostering regime, the
manufactures of Victoria have reached a
point so far ahead of those of the other
colonies that, except in special cases, competi-
tion would for long be hopeless. Whether in
war or peace, when once a nation or a province
gets a long start of another, it is next to im-
possible to catch up. Three months in 1870
sufficed to bring France to her knees. Could
she but have obtained time to stand erect
and pull herself together before the final
fiasco at Paris, things might have been
different. But the Germans knew better
than to allow her. With Victorian capital
spread prodigally and thickly over Biverina,
Queensland, and other places, and with A ic-
toria manufacturing goods of a high quality
and a low price, what, in a few years, would
become of the boasted supremacy, or even
equality, of New South W ales ? It is idle to
say that manufactures will follow coal and
iron. They have not done so in Australia,
owing to the supineness of one portion of
the people, the selfishness of a second, and
the scheming of a third. Federate then
“ under the Crown,” with the provinces at
their present size, followed by Freetrade
from Carpentaria to and for years
and years you throw the whole commercial
supremacy into the arms of Melbourne —in
a word, cut the throat of New South Wales
as dexterously as Castlekeagh cut Ireland’s.
* * *
Let us now consider the question of in-
vasion in the event of independence. In a
late London magazine a military officer of
high rank has expressed the opinion that the
world might be searched in vain for a people
at once so rich and so helpless as the Aus-
tralians. He considers that, in the event of
the cessation of British sovereignty, no time
would be lost before the predatory powers of
Europe raced with each other for the posses-
sion of the whole or a part of such a wind-
fall. In commending this view the Sydney
Morning Herald stated that in the event of
England’s withdrawal any of the great
Powers could send here a sufficient force to
entrench itself and defy all Australia to shift
it. This is not only true, but its truth is too
obvious to be disputed. Any nation with
command of the sea could seize any un-
occupied and advantageously-situated spot
on the coast of any country, and, if allowed
time, fortify it in such a manner as to be
next to impregnable. The whole power of
Spain and France combined would probably
fail now, as it failed before, in taking Gib-
raltar—so long as Britain held the sea.
Although, however, Gibraltar is of vital
importance to England in many ways, she
does not attempt to advance across the
neutral ground into Spain. She has no wish
to do could not do it if she had. Once
let her leave the shadow of the sheltering
rock for the purpose of an advance into
Andalusia and, unless she advanced with a
force far greater than ever sailed from the
coast of Britain, ultimate defeat and retreat
would be inevitable. But the idea of a
foreign Power’s fixing on a desolate Aus-
tralian promontory and fortifying it, without
being able to proceed any great distance
from the base of operations, and with nothing-
particular to gain by proceeding, is fantastic.
# * *
This is not all. It may be said that,
but for the help given by the French and
Spanish forces (a help balanced by the
assistance afforded by Hessian mercenaries to
England), America would not have attained
independence at the time. Washington,
probably, and Mr. Tom Paine, certainly,
would have been hanged when caught. Still,
no country has since attempted to dispute
her right over a territory larger than Aus-
tralia. Should it be advanced that the
nations of Europe M ere too busy watching
and tearing each other for the 26 years from
the fall of the Bastille to the collapse at
Waterloo to care about the Union and its
ways, it may be answered that in 1814 the
British found their way to Washington, but
took care not to remain there. Again, there
exist in South America, within a couple of
weeks’ sail from Europe, magnificent and
sparsely-populated lands, on whose coasts
European Powers could erect fortresses every
mile with little fear of being disturbed.
Why do they not do so ? Because the Union
would put its foot down with an empathic
“hands off,” it may be answered. This
brings us to the kernel of the matter. In
the event of even immediate federation and
independence, it is wildly improbable that
rtny Power would presume to interfere wit h
Australia’s development in the direction of
a powerful Democracy. But, even if Aus-
tralia failed in the effort to hold her own,
it is almost certain that the great North
American Republic would never tolerate the
subversion of a kindred people, whose only
aim was to work out its own destiny on the
lines laid down by the famous men of a
century ago. Why should Australians seek
for a possible American guarantee while they
have a certain British one already 1 ? The
answers are many, but one will suffice. It
is because connection with an old monarchy
like England, where privilege is still rampant,
and where pinchbeck titles are still revered
by hereditary parasites, has a tendency to
foster a similar state of society here. In
brief, we want to breed here a nation of
men, not of snobs, or, if that is impossible,
to take care that the sycophant is not re-
warded for his fiunkeyism by means of a
foreign and trumpery title. It would pay
Australia better to —using the words of Sir
George Grey —“ loosely federate” with the
United States than with Great Britain.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“ Not Provided For.”
Treasurer M'Millan has snappishly with-
drawn the New South Wales Government
account from the City Bank, on the grounds
that the latter contravened explicit Treasury
instructions by permitting an unauthorised over-
draft to the Department of Public Instruction,
and, later on, obeyed the orders of the Treasury
by dishonoring cheques for which no funds had
been provided. Altogether, 537 cheques were
dishonored, the total amount represented being
£3301 13s. 6d., but the Treasurer confines his
anathemas to the dishonor of two paltry cheques
of £9 *2s. fid, and £5 I7s. respectively. To
rightly assess the blame of this pretty quarrel,
it is necessary to remember a criminal case of
embezzlement by overdraft in which the London
Chartered Bank had to stand a big loss. It is
also requisite to regard dates. On 10th January,
1890, Mr. Geoffrey Eagar, Under-Secretary
of the Treasury, notified, amongst other insti-
tutions, the City Bank, ‘ ‘ that overdraft must
not be allowed on any public account under
any circumstances whatever, except upon the
written authority of the Colonial Treasurer,
conveyed to you in the usual official way.' -
That was 13 months ago. On 19th January,
1891, the Public Instruction Department, hav-
ing no funds whatever to its credit, issued
cheques which the City Bank honored,
and which incurred an overdraft oi
£1256 4s. 7d. The bank immediately
notified the Treasury of this fact. On the 20th
and 21st of January last, more cheques were
presented and honoured, and on the 22nd ult.
the Educational overdraft was £3558 17s. Id.
A bank officer was then despatched to inter-
view Mr. Geoffrey .Eagar personally. Mr.
Eagar severely reprimanded the bank for per-
mitting an overdraft, but said, in reply to a
question, that £5OOO would be paid in to the
credit of the bank that afternoon. That
amount was so paid in, anti lasted until the
24th ult., when the credit again became ex-
hausted. The bank, now thoroughly on its guard,
dishonoured some cheques drawn on the non-
existent account the same tlay. On the 27th
January —or eight days after—the bank re-
ceived a written reply to its first communica-
tion of the 19th. This reply asked for an
explanation respecting the irregularity of having
permitted an overdraft. On the 30th, the
Treasurer formally authorised an overdraft of
£lO,OOO in that particular account. On 3rd
February, the Treasurer notified the bank that
the Government account would be withdrawn,
and emphasised that notification by reitera-
tion on the sth instant. In other words, the
Government lias decided to punish and persecute
a bank for foolishly (or generously) upholding the
public credit without funds and without autho-
rity. The bank no doubt was guilty of a techni-
cal offence in not obeying literally the Treasury
instructions. But the principal blame lay with
the Public Instruction Department, the res-
ponsible head of which either did or did not
know that his account was exhausted. If he
did not know, then he has proved himself an
incompetent and negligent officer; if he did
know, then he wittingly issued valueless
cheques —an offence with a very serious side to
it, in the case of a private person. The bank
showed a fair degree of caution in despatching
an officer to interview Mr. Eagar, but again
they did not literally follow instructions and
obtain “the loritten authority of the Colonial
Treasurer.” That is no small matter, however,
for it is not always an easy matter to get at Mr.
M‘Mxllan or any other Minister. Two necessary
things appear to have been left undone. The
Public Instruction Department should itself
have notified the Treasury that it was hard-up,
and the bank should have warned the Public
Instruction Department as well as the Treasury.
The whole now shows how loosely the public
accounts are kept by the various Government
Departments, and if the bank has erred lightly
in the first degree, the Government has sinned
grievously in the seventh and higher degree,
and is now trying to cover its faults by sham ■
ming a virtuous patriotism for ‘ ‘ public in
terests.” The withdrawing of the Government
account is an unwarrantable act of vindictive
injustice.
H.M. Ship Penguin.
The story of the warship Penguin, now lying
at Hobart, seems to be the old story of the
Egeria over again, with sundry variations for
the worse, the Penguin being apparently the
nether hell of the naval service, while the
Egeria was an upper region of the same deep-
sea Gehenna. The tale, as told by the crew, is
the same as has already been told so often in
British history. The ship was bossed by a
“ rigid disciplinarian,” and life on board
seems to have been one incessant round
of work and punishment, with more work and
more punishment by way of variety. At
Fremantle the crew broke into open mutiny,
and looted the stores, and for a little while it
seems to have been a toss-up whether they did


not make a glorious bonfire of the vessel, and
leave a vacancy in the British navy. One sailor
deserted, and ultimately died of exposure and
starvation ; a lieutenant who attempted to
remonstrate is awaiting trial by court-martial;
and the ship’s company in general seems to have
been divided into two sections—a small party
which was dead, and a large one that wanted
to be. The life of the alleged joyous tar con-
sists, at the best, chiefly of small pay and hard
biscuit; generally it is largely mixed up with
execrations and chains and similar pleasant
facts ; and when he strikes a worse patch than
usual he is practically in hell on a precarious
income. And if he mutinies and is hanged the
chances are that he only loses the income ; the
location, we should imagine, remains about the
same.
The Progressive Gladstone.
The great Parnell-O’Shea riot has left at
least one enduring result behind it —it has
made a woeful smash in Gladstone’s reputa-
tion for political honesty. When that wily
statesman introduced his famous Home Rule
Bill he provided that the Imperial Parliament
should still dictate the fiscal and land policy of
Ireland, and should appoint magistrates and
judges, and retain the entire control of the con-
stabulary, so that the new Irish Parliament
was to be the mere shadow of a shade. But
the measure was accepted as the beginning of
better things. It was the first recognition of
the Irishman’s right to govern himself, and
there was unlimited confidence in the further
expansion of Gladstone’s newly-awakened
Liberalism. Since then the lavish eloquence of
the old politician has led to a firm conviction
that the next Home Rule Bill would provide
for a genuine instead of a bogus system of
autonomy, and this conviction held good until
the Irish party endeavoured to obtain some
definite assurances, and then the ancient
Liberal straightway froze up and refused to
commit himself to anything further than the
abortive measure of five years ago. The com-
plaint of the Irish people is that their manufac-
tures were ruined through the Freetrade system
forced upon them by England, and if England
is to boss the fiscal policy of Ireland there is no
hope of improvement. Also they point out that
their agricultural industry has been destroyed
by the English land system, and if the Irish
Parliament is to have no power to improve the
land system then the people will remain as poor
and as wretched as before. And, in addition to
these grievances, the laws are administered
exclusively in the landlord’s interest by English
Tory magistrates, and the people are harassed
and outraged by a police force maintained solely
for the defence of property-owners, and if this
evil also is to be beyond the sphere of Irish
politics then there is no reason or logic in Home
Rule at all. Apparently Gladstone has not
learned anything new in the past five years,
and if so his Irish policy and that of Salisbury
have no material points of difference; They take
simply two separate ways of making the same
mistake.

We have read in the English press by recent
mails at least fifty such protests as this :
At Chester Assizes, Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams sat
from 9.30 a.m. till midnight in order to get through the
calendar and keep his appointment at Caermarthen,
which had already been postponed for two days. The
midnight sitting at Chester wound up with a sentence of
five years’ penal servitude on a woman convicted of per-
jury. That the woman did not deserve it we should be
sorry to say, but that her case was tried with the care
and attention which every prisoner ought to receive is
altogether open to doubt. In saying this we pass no
reproach upon the Judge or any one else concerned. It
is simply inconceivable that men engaged in hard intel-
lectual work for twelve or fourteen hours at a stretch can
keep their-judgment clear and their brains vigorous to
the last; and it stands to reason that when prisoners are
being tried in this fashion against time—Judge, jury, and
counsel all knowing that they cannot get to bed till the
job is done—the business must be hurried and scamped
to a greater or less extent.
Such is the spirit in which a trial of this kind
—involving merely the liberty of one person—
is received by the British press and public.
What, then, would public opinion in
England say of the Mount Rennie case, at
Sydney, in which a week of exhausting sittings,
all devoted to this one case, was wound up by
(he Court sitting right on from Friday morning
at 0 o'clock until Saturday morning at d.JO, and
then n mming business at 9 undock same morning
—to sit right on till half -au-honr before midnight,
at which time nine out of eleven youths were
sentenced to death, four of them being subse-
quently executed with the concurrence of Baron
Cakington, whose governorship of New South
Wales has been pronounced, by people who
know nothing about it, to have been so howling
a success? When is justice to lie done to the
surviving remnant of these miserables—and to
Sweetman, victim of a savage and unjust
sentence ?
“ Thermidor,” by Sardou, has been pro*
hibited in Paris because of its anti-Robespierre-
ism. Now, Sydney sillies rise to remark that
this proves that democracy is unlimited
tyranny. As a matter of fact, the play is
prohibited in the interests of peace and human
life—because the admirers of the Montagnard
have threatened to wreck any theatre where
it may bo played, and have already come to
blows with the descendants of the Girondists
and Royalists, to whom Robes pier he’s name is
as a red rag. Putting that aside, to make a
parallel —would the Pahkes (lev eminent permit
anyone to produce a play reflecting on the
morality of Queen Victoria, or to march down
the back slums playing “ Boyne Water,” or
“ Croppies Lie Down ? ” Yet the refusals would
not be styled tyrannical by the papers alluded
to.
The London Times wants to know what is the
good of creating an Irish Parliament in Dublin,
considering what an awful wreck of imbecility
and grovel and rowdyism and incapacity the
Irish Parliament used to be when it howled on
College Green away back in the last century,
and allowed itself on an average the meanest
legislative assembly in Europe. Looking back
on that Irish Parliament, it certainly was a
remarkable gathering, and taking it all round
it would have sold its country or its father for
a sixpence. But as no Catholic was allowed to
uite in these good old days, any more than any
Catholic was allowed to sit in the House, so it fol-
lowsthat thatghastly Legislature represented the
Times’s own party and no other, and it was
made up of Abigail’s ancestors and the prede-
cessors of the whole modern race of Orange
bigots generally. The complaint that the Irish
nation is not fit for self-government comes with
rather a bad grace from the handful of Ulster
fanatics who kept the whole government to
themselves by the aid of a foreign army, and
the story of that old Parliament, if it shows
anything at all, is sufficient proof that the
Orangeman should be disfranchised for corrup-
tion, intolerance, general idiocy, and various
other causes.
A Melbourne anti-vaccinationist, one of whose
children had suffered grievously from the after-
effects of vaccination, has been proceeded
against for refusing to run the risk of thus
inflicting life-suffering on another of his little
ones. When fined, the defendant pathetically
asked, “If Tgoto gaol will I save my child? I don’t
mind that to save my little one from a dread-
ful risk.” Now, there seems to be little doubt
that vaccination is a preventive of smallpox;
there is also little doubt that it is now and then
the means of communicating blood-poisoning
and glandular diseases. Taking all into con-
sideration, it is not evident that the Govern-
ment of any country are wise in forcing parents
to subject their children to an operation only
of problematical value while of possible hurt.
The writer has never forgotten the fiery diatribe,
accentuated by a wealth of regret for the lost
one, that Gerald Massey launched at the
officialism that doomed his only child to fade
away beneath his eyes, the victim of a loath-
some disease caused by vaccination.
That little podgy nobleman, the Duke of
Argyle, writes thus upon the agitation for
Home Rule in Scotland :—-
I never hear a word about Home Rule for Scotland,
except the report of a few foolish speeches in the papers.
As we don’t know what Home Rule means even for Ire-
land, there is no use in discussing-that enigmatical phrase
as applied to Scotland. All the wealth and prosperity of
Scotland dates from the Union, and it would be putting
back the clock indeed to go back to our former state of
“ single blessedness,” which was one of great poverty and
frequent distress.
Just so. Also the wealth and prosperity of
America date from the hanging of Major Andre,
and the fall of Holland dates from the great fire
of London, but it doesn’t follow that there is
any connection between these events, all the
same. Further, the Kelly Gang date from
about the time of the City of Glasgow Bank
failure, and half-a-dozen revolutions broke out
in Europe almost immediately after the first
bishop arrived in Melbourne, and the Duke of
Argyle himself probably dates from the time
when somebody was hanged in Siam. When a
duke starts to draw an inference something is
certain to go wrong.

The Gentlewoman, a large London publication
which panders to the female passion for grovel,
lately went into hysterics over those two puerile
shadows of French royalty, the Comte and
Comtesse de Paris. Although the second-hand
pretenders are playing their old family farce in
England, “it is a significant fact,” chirps the
Gentlewoman, “ that the mansion is only
hired, reminding you that the Comte de Paris
regards himself as but a sojourner in a foreign
land. And although the time of exile may be
weary waiting, there is comfort in the thought
that there is a tide in the affairs of men, &c.,
and, as the Comte has himself declared,
‘ Uheure venue je serai pret. ’ ” There is precious
little comfort in the thought that such greasy
balderdash is enjoyed by a number, however
small, of British matrons, who hang on to the
vague idea that this fatuous French loafer will
one day be sent for to “save his country.” No
other kind of Tory journalism is so shamelessly
snobbish and hopelessly stupid as the stuff pre-
pared for “ ladies ” only. Yet it fills, pre-
sumably, the usual long-felt want. And we
Radicals, who rejoice to find the great majority
of mankind turning their backs upon the effete
monarchical idol, must still recognise the poison-
ous existence of people that write—“ You
should certainly make a loyal effort to see the
temple of Concord and Victory ” (in the grounds
adjoining the Comte de Paris’ “ royal ” abode)
“if only for the reason that Queen Victoria
planted the oaks, and the late Prince Consort
the two cedars in front of it.” Booh ! In the
meantime we will make a loyal effort not to be
sick.

Apropos to Florence St. John’s libel action
against a paper which said her jewels were
stolen for advertising purposes, or something
to that effect, “ Oak ados,” of London Referee,
writes : -
Critics, according to certain members of the profession,
are all very well while they slaver and butter and grovel
and adulate and show they know how to “ keep their
place ”in presence of their superiors. They become the
worst and vilest and cruellest creatures in the world
directly they dare move in another direction. As the
majority of critics are quite satisfied to accept the posi-
tion, and to eat dirt when desired by the so-called heads
of the dramatic profession, there is no reason why 1
should step forth and defend them. . . . Therefore it
will suffice for me to say, as I have often said before, that
I am utterly unable to understand upon what logical
grounds actors and actresses suck in praise just as a cat
sucks in cream, and then rush off to the law-courts
directly anything appears in a paper that is contrary to
their living.
The Bulletin would suggest that logical
reasoning is not to be expected of theatrical
folk, the majority of whom are so blinded by
egotism, and so professionally petty-minded
as to he incapable of attributing an unfavour-
able criticism, or blunt comment, to honest
motives. The writer who merely puts into
his own words, as a matter of business,
the true sense of what the majority of
the public happens to be saying, never hopes to
get thought other than a vindictive fool by
many players and some managers who believe
(and purr over) everything written for journals
which instruct their critics either to lie like
tombstones for the sake of the advertisement,
or to “let them down easy” so that no irate
mummers may come bothering with complaints
at the office, or for journals which haven’t a man
on the staff competent to report shows and
keep his right hand unfettered by theatrical
friendships or acquaintances while so doing.
But although the grovel of the orthodox Press
is at times very disgusting, it must be admitted
that there are extenuating circumstances in
■certain cases. The representative of a highly -
influential daily newspaper who could invariably
avoid being “ squared ” with soft.words, cigars,
tender glances, strong drinks, or more weighty
arguments, has not, probably, been born up to
now. Suppose an actress, a tall, large-eyed,
elegantly-appointed creature—gets an introduc-
tion to him, and whispers “How unkind you
were in your last notice.” Is it in human
nature for the mouthpiece of public opinion to
go home and say, even in the most veiled lan-
guage, that the aforesaid actress has no more
talent than a potato-famine ?
Ik blissful ignorance that the ArGus has offi-
cially fainted over the Parnell “ disclosures,”
the London Social Gossiper of that anti-Irish
organ reckons up the situation as follows :
A saturnine bachelor has formed a liaison with a
flighty and attractive woman of his own aye, and the
thing has got into the papers. There are dozens of such
affairs known and recognised in society and the world at
large. One or two other political leaders are in similar
chains, as are many leading admirals, generals, officials,
artists, actors, peers, millionaires, and Q.O.’s. The man
in such cases is prima facie an object of men’s sympathy.
How did he get entangled?—will he ever get free?—such
are the questions to which his condition gives rise. But
on the great outside public the effect in this case has been
far otherwise. The outside public never learns anything.
Year, after year it goes through its course of Divorce
Court shocks, but it knows no more of human nature in
its old age than it did in its childhood.
There is no pretence of high morality in the
sentiments of this accomplished prattler. He is
merely a man of the world talking the common-
sense to which his employer (the Argus) has
not sufficient honesty or pluck to give expres-
sion. It is refreshing to find the Gossiper tell-
ing how—
Day after day, man after man arose to repudiate Mr.
Parnell and all his works. Some of them were worthy
and religious men enough, but there were joined unto
them many unworthy fellows—one, for example, a
drunken and immoral buffoon ; another a man of fashion
just released after many agonising throes from a like
liaison with a Scotch peeress, &c., &c.—such a,procession
of harefaced hypocrites as never before crossed the ivorld’s
stage.
And at the end of this procession the Argus
had—unknown to its own faithful Gossiper—
been flaunting its wretched “ respectable ” little
banner in the breeze created by the flapping of
the wings of Hypocrisy over the soft, addled
head of Ignorance. Every now and then a
fresh, luxuriant joke may be plucked from the
stony ground of dull daily journalism.
The Daily Northern Argus (Rockhampton)
has discovered that Lord Carington “has not
been Governor of the parent colony of Aus-
tralia for nothing ; and that the frequent and
pungent criticisms of The Bulletin upon his
ability to take an intelligent view of political
questions affecting Australia were considerably
overdone—overdone to malice, for the only
reason that the subject of them—shall we say
it?—was a peer of the realm.” The D.N.A.
has suddenly evolved a veneration for Caring-
ton, because the latter was “ plucky enough ”
to say ‘ ‘ before the future King of England ”
“ that the colonies don’t want and will resent
English interference in their affairs, and that
they consider that Imperial Federation is un-
workable.” The D.N.A. is correct within
narrow limits, but fails to become seized of all
the- facts connected with Carington’s conver-
sion. It is no vain boastfulness, but a desire
to be truthful, that leads us to point out
that it is from The Bulletin that Carington
received his education on Australian aspira-
tions and anti-imperialistic sentiments —that,
in short, The Bulletin and the now strong
party whom it has inspired, converted Caring-
ton, turning him from the darkness of Tummy-
dom into the light of free self-government.
Even the D.N.A., how'ever, can’t “abide”
Cakington’s proposal to create an Australian
peerage, so that The Bulletin’s “ frequent
and pungent criticisms ” were rather underdone
than “ considerably overdone.” The Bulletin
has no special ‘ ‘ malice ” against Carington—
it merely loathes the sight of a titled nobody
from afar off with a reputation for wealth and
Royal favour and a lot of racecourse and society
cunning as his stock-in-trade, placed in the
chair which should be filled, amid the acclaim
of the Australian nation, by aii able and
patriotic Australian.
Dear Bulletin. —In an article of the 24th
ult. you deal with Australia’s borrowing, and
adduce cogent reasons for discontinuing the
practice, but have overlooked the reason most
likely to weigh with the present generation,
viz., that the present effect of the expenditure
of borrowed money by any country must be to
reduce the amount of ready money in that
country; e.<j. , Gillies and Co, spent in five
years thirteen millions of foreign capital. On
what? Permanent improvements. It required
labor of the value say of €7,000,U00 to effect
these improvements, and consequently labour
of that value was withdrawn from avenues of
production. These labourers were paid market
rates, and would not have starved had no loan
monies been expended. It appears, therefore,
(hat the exchangeable values of the country
were reduced by a sum equal to the earnings of
that labour under nominal conditions, say
£7,000,000. If this view be correct, and gain
acceptance wdth the public generally, it will do
more to check our extravagant loan expenditure
than the most convincing arguments founded on
any actual or supposed injury to posterity. I
have refrained from discussing the values of
these permanent improvements, as that does not
affect my argument However valuable these
may be, they do not represent ready money or
exchangeable values.—C.W.C.

Though the Federation of Australia has not
yet begun, the people of Albury have again
started to agitate for the appointment of their
town as the federal capital, and Parkes, it is
hardly necessary to mention, agrees that the
little settlement on the New South Wales
border must be the political centre of United
Australia. Everybody who knows Parkes
must have foreseen that the old man would
discover some place in his own province to be
the only possible capital of the Federation, and
if the other provinces fail to see it, he will pro-
bably back out more in sorrow than in anger,
and tell in after years that be and 29 other
men had two opinions between them, and if tha
other 28 hadn’t been so ignorant and so miser-
ably obstinate all might have been well. Tha
only disadvantage about Albury, regarded as
the central point of the new State, is that it
isn’t in the centre of anything, and that it is at
the far south-eastern corner of everything, and
its one decided advantage is that Parkes
wants it, and if Parkes climbs on a chair and
howls for the moon he must have it, or else
break something. It is about as suitable as a
dozen other towns, and that is all. In any case
it is an ominous sign that New South Wales
should have started to scramble so very early
for the chance of getting ahead of the other
Australias. The object of Federation is the
general good of Australia, and not the separate
advantage of any particular State, and even if
tire capital should be ultimately planted out in
the great Australian desert, no one has any
just cause to complain. But we are surprised
at the silence of the Wentworthites, the old
disputers of Albury folks’ claim to the title of
“ Federal Capital.”

Arthur Rae, shearers’ delegate, says that the
squatters’ new agreement gives each individual
squatter power to make and to enforce what-
ever additional regulations he chooses to impose
on his shed slaves. The Bulletin notes also
that the agreement proposes to compel the
“general hand” to “continue working from
day to day till the whole of the sheep and
lambs ” are shorn, thus robbing him of his
right to leave after a week’s notice, while it
permits the master to “ sack ” the man at any
time. Thus, a “white-headed boy” of the
overseer may come along looking for a job, and
the overseer may immediately find fault with
and discharge a hand to put on his favourite.
Under the existing rules, no member of the
general labourers’ union can take the place of
another member so discharged, and there is an
unwritten law prohibiting a member camping
at any station to wait for such a “ death.” If
a member can’t be put on at once, he must
travel further.
We have amongst us so many filthy whites that
we cannot afford to welcome to Australia the East
Indian, our fellow-citizen under the glorious
British flag. We must deal with him as we
have dealt with our beloved fellow-citizen the
Hongkong Chinaman. The Indians are terrors
to unprotected women and children, whom
they always contrive to interview when the
males of the family are abroad. The city dens
that shelter these spindle-shanked niggers are
almost invariably lazar-houses of filth, vermin,
and infamy. At Sydney Police Court last week
Mahomet Something was fined CIO for keeping
filthy premises. In five rooms he herded 40
nigs. In one room, lying on a vermin-infested
mattress on the floor, were one woman and two
girls, “stark naked and covered with hideous
sores.” The house reeked with stenches from
putrefying animal and vegetable refuse which
littered the floors, and the back-yard was a bog
of heterogeneous corruption. Yet this was the
place where sauces were made, to be hawked
round town. Just fancy eating roast fowl
stuffed by a Chinese cook and served up with
Mahomet sauce !
Thus the principal leading idiot of the Austra-
lasian :
One of the functions, for instance, which the demo-
cratic spirit claims as its own is to prove that there is no
such thing as superiority, and no such beings as superior
persons. Acting on religions it resolves the gods into
solar myths, and proves that the priests and prophets
and saints of the hagiologies either never existed, or
were grossly overrated persons. In politics it shows that
the theory of the divine right of Kings was simply a sac-
religious invention of successful robbers, and it prefers as
its Parliamentary representatives not men of light and
learning, but servile delegates with capacity for dis-
sembling and for repeating the clamours and shibboleths
of the hour. In the household the father has ceased to be
priest and king, and his patriarchal despotism has been
changed into a very limited monarchy, in which a strong
public opinion exists in favour of *“ sparing the rod.”
Children no longer stand uncovered in their parents’
presence till bidden to be seated, and no longer address
them ceremoniously as “ Sir ”or “ Madam.” Amid such
changes it would be impossible for the relation of master
and scholar to be unaffected, and accordingly it is melan-
choly to think how degenerate a being the schoolmaster
of to-day is compared with the Plagosus Orbilius of
Horace, or the awful Dr. Busby, who refused a bishopric
because he had flogged every bishop on the bench.
The Bulletin hereupon gets tip to ask the
Australasian one question : What is that old
hunk of print driving at ? Does it claim that
“the gods” are not myths, and is it ready to
worship the eat and the onion and the stuffed
monkey and the leek, and to become a Druid,
and to burn incense and whoop in a naked state
on the mountain tops, after the fashion that
existed in the old ante-democratic days, and if
it isn’t, then what is it howling about? Is it
prepared to maintain the “divine right of
Kings,” and to claim that William of Nor-
mandy was the special servant of the Lord
because he successfully killed his predecessor,
and cut off the hands and feet and burned out
the eyes of his predecessor’s followers ; and that
Richard 111. was divinely appointed because
he murdered his nephew; and that Victoria
reigns by the grace of Rod because the venal
Welsh member whose vote decided that the
house of Guelph should rule in place of the
house of Stuart broke his horse’s neck on the
road to London instead of breaking his own ;
and if not what is the row about ? Or again,
supposing the Orange plot of 1885 had suc-
ceeded, and Victoria had been ejected or other-
wise “ disposed of ” to make May for the Duke
of Cumberland, would he also have possessed
the “ divine right of Kings,” and in that case
does divine right mean the same as robbery with
violence? Also, when this apostle of brutality
wails because the old flogging days are over,
does it wail because it wants to flog somebody
else—say a woman or a child—or to be flogged
itself; and if any of these ideas is the case, why
doesn’t it state the fact openly, or, on the other
hand, if neither is the case, what is the cause
of the unearthly disturbance ? If the Austra-
lasian ever offered a coherent explanation in
its life would it kindly offer one now, and ex-
plain what it wants.
Count Herisaon, in his “ Memoirs of
Napoleon III,” denies that the surrendorer of
Sedan died under the operation of lithotrity, but
attributes his death to an overdose of chloral
administered in spite of his violent antipathy to
that sedative.

SIC Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Feb. 11, IROI
My Dear Moorabinda. —
Though Lord Jersey may not be stylish enough to
frame, ho makes amends for it in his staff, which is rather
a relief after the baggy, puffy, taciturn, odd-sized and
bald-headed following of the other idol. The Earl of
Ancrura (by the by, the sun must have got into my eyes
when I accused him of having red hair) is a charming
youth with an interesting pallor and a small dark
moustache—the realised dream of any .boarding-school;
brother Rupert No. 2, “Chumley,” and Goschen are
generally beautiful to gaze on, but their chief attraction
is their youth and kittenishness. One has no fear lest
their joints should stiffen when they stand on the damp
grass, and you could go deeply into the gout question
before the whole crowd of them without embarrassing a
single aide-de-camp. Secretary Goschen, by the way, is
rather too skittish for some of the poker-backed members
of a Sydney club, for lie sat on a table in the sacred pre-
cincts the other evening, I am told, and strung his heels
while the strict etiquette-ridden raembahs present gazed
at him in a stony way and failed to see the airy cama-
raderie of the thing.
Lord Carington was once guilty of a still more un-
dignified perch—at the Camden Hospital opening. lie
was welcoming the first patients to that worthy institu-
tion, and he did so roosting with pendulating feet on the
edge of an umbrella-stand !!! But then any number of
young gentlemen—heirs to big softgoods shops—will tell
you in a horrified whisper that “ Carington really wasn't
quite form, dontcherknow.”
We are fast becoming familiarized with the unassuming
Lord Jersey. We are getting to know the misfit, funnel-
shaped beaver, the long-waisted frock coat, themuliebrous
smile and the bulgy umbrella which appertain to the
brand-new Governor when he hasn’t his cocked hat and
trimmings on. People have become inured to Jersey in
a surprisingly short time. At the opening of the big
tomato and fat-horse show at Parramatta lie went the
rounds with only two of the committee to do \vorship t
and even the children of the forest and the dazed Being
with the clay of the orange orchard on his bluchers didn't
think it worth while to troop after him from stall to stall
with their mouths open in the good old way, but let him
amble by without even turning sometimes.
The so-called “ improper story ” which caused so much
trouble at the Union Club the other day was a very harm-
less thing after all—that is to say if I am to regard as
authentic a version supplied to me by a married woman
of my acquaintance. In fact, there was no story at all—
the cause of the fuss consisting in a very outspoken
remark, which was thought so little of that the lady con-
cerned conveyed it to her fiery husband by way of
anecdote, and not by way of complaint.
Speaking of Clubs, I hear that a recently-returned
member of one of these intends to try and introduce the
custom observed in all really‘swagger British clubs, of
having ail change washed before it is given to a member.
The notion is hygienic, anyhow. Some of the money
given in the clubs must have come from the “ vegetable
John,” who usually counts his change into his mouth us
an extra precaution. And then just consider the un-
cleanliness of the methods by which so many of the mag-
nates of the land get their money !
On dit that the recent tour of a toney concert company
in a hilly and windy land was of a decidedly gay and
festive character. One excursion was taken in a tandem
which was rushed along at such a “ bat ” that the leader
was left for dead on the roadside, and the shaft-horse
staggered in on three legs. All this happened just after
the lunch.
I hear of a couple of impending divorce-suits, the
defendant being in each case a Benedict who has dis-
tinguished himself witli a lady introduced to help in the
household machinery. When ladies are introduced to
help in the household machinery, they very often do
help in it—in fact, 1 have come to regard lady-helps as
women who help themselves to the mistress's shoes. The
psychologically - interesting part of one of these little
skirmishes off the path of duty is that the legal charmer
is ever so much more attractive than (he tootsy-
wootsy : the prospective plaintiff is a really taking
woman, while the coining co respondent has a shape that
suggests empty reels of cotton on wires, a bilious eye
and a set of yellow teetli that would do credit to a horse.
“ Variety is the spice of life,” of course, but it is difficult
to understand why some people leave peaches and cream
for crali apples and vinegar.
The question that is alleged to be agitating half the
social world at present is whether the appropriated
angel ought to visit the theatre with any other man but
her husband, or her grandfather, or somebody else
equally harmless. The consensus of public opinion seems
to be in the negative. But why should not the neglected
sposa of the gentleman who is too bored to run her out
o •casionally, be allowed the brief boon of spending an
Lour or two in a plush chair beside a male friend
of the family? But thete are some decollete
matrons (I have two or three in my mind’s eye,
Horatio) of the “ I-want-to-be-a-widow ” variety, who
carl their chemicallocks on top o( their dyed eyebrows
and are as instructive as an anatomy seance, to whom
this freedom sjiould not be given. If a friendly man
takes one of them anywhere—out of kindness, or to pay
asocial debt—she immediately concludes that he is des-
perately in love with her, and lets her stiffened locks
tickle ins fear as she leans towards him at a painful slant.
For matrons of this variety (lie whole race of men, bar
ing their ow n legal property, should be labelled “ pizen.”
It is an unnatural sight to see how a leading man at n
Sydney theatre takes hold of the leading lady in the
most impressive love scenes, as if he were frightened some
long, deadly pin in her make-up might lose its grip and
bring about a dire catastrophe. When he strokes his
darling’s hair his caressing palm is quite four inches off
her cranial doormat, and the wooden way in which the
clinging arms of love are adjusted about her willowy form
smacks loudly an inch off the lobe of her shelly ear!
I he canoodling right through is so mechanical that one
almost yearns for a touch of the bounding passion of the
Potter, who hurled herself with a shriek at the man of
her choice and rather preferred to bow her acknowledge-
ments with her back hair in her mouth.
Quite the latest excitement in a large and pious circle
is the “ China Inland Mission,” in respect to which ever
so many young men and women hear the Divine voice
calling them to the region of easy divorces and almond
eyes. It’s a lovely idea—the Mission-for the he or she
who has a fancy for a turn round a strange land and no
objection to travel under the most Arcadian conditions,
and withal in an odour of sanctity. I am much grieved,
however, to read in a pamphlet on China that “though
there are earnest men and women amongst the foreign
missionaries, the misdeeds of a few have brought the
body as a class into disrepute.” If I were a ma, and a
daughter of mine wanted to go and convert the Chinese
in company with a lot of young men and women who
proposed going to China in the same ship, I am sure I
should insist on one of the young men marrying my girl
before she left Australia. That is all I have to say on the
subject at present, beyond remarking that people who are
very pious are always dreadfully affectionate.
The She-Miss'.onary is always more or less equivocal
even when she hasn’t fallen “as a class” into actual dis-
repute, and the best of her generally keeps a spicy record
of her “ experiences,” and one or two of the leading pro-
perties of the country in her Gladstone bag ; after which
she invariably secures, in her pious innocence, the best
show-agent disengaged and launches out in the paying
churchy-show business “ under the patronage of the
Primate.” The lady disciple in the show biz. has always
commanded my wondering admiration for the worldly
way she can gather up a treasury every Saturday, and
the far-off, dreamy manner in which she gets into a pair
of pants on a fifteen-feet stage, because they are the
correct wear for ladies in the Barbarian land she carries
about with her.
Woman always has been a weird anomaly, and she
doesn’t mean to alter awhile. For instance, the Cruelty
to Animals Society in Sydney is principally composed of
energetic ladies, who proudly wear its medals on their
bosoms, and start into eager life if a cabby cracks his
whip. And yet recently I was in an omnibus with one of
these Avengers, when on a steep hill a passenger stopped
and alighted. On jerked the poor horses again for about
a yard, when the Dumb Animals’ Friend hung on the
strap to be let out, and another hard pull resulted. It
was very evident her humanity didn’t include tracking a
yard uphill on her philanthropic tootsy-wootsy.
The Goulburn Cathedral squabble, chapter 2, will pro-
bably end in favour of Captain Rossi, whose love of
scarlet neckties and reputation for breeding prize pug-
dogs don’t seem to interfere with his religious convic-
tions. Now, if the Captain (he is, or was, a captain of
volunteers) bred prize bull-dogs and wore red neckties he
couldn’t possibly be a good man.
1 am told that on the evening of the great Federal
Convention banquet on 2nd March in Sydney Centennial
Hall womankind will be allowed into the galleries to
focus its hungry gaze upon the disappearing ham.
Principally under the safe chaperonage of Secretary
Wellington, the Ladies Hope, sisters of the Victorian
Governor, did the Blue Mountains as far as Katoomba
last week, stopping at the “ Carrington.” They were
greatly impressed by the bounding untamed waratah in
its native lair, and toiled about after the lions with the
enthusiasm of the ordinary untitled she who revels in an
excursion ticket. A future jaunt of the ladies will be to
the Jenolan Caves. By the way, there was a half-
expressed opinion amongst local sassiety that the newly-
arrived “ scionesses ” of nobility didn't get quite as much
change out of their lordly prefix, so to speak, as any
newly-made colonial “lady” does out of hers, and one
leading Sydney society person who dreams of the time
when she can assume the frills that appertain to a gilded
“handle,” plaintively remarked that “The dear things
weren’t quite reserved enough—not for titled women, my
dear.”
The successful amateur athlete of to-day is apt to
develope into a nuisance in his family circle—unless that
circle is stripped of the conveniences of life, and eats its
mutton off tin plates. He fills the house with his
guerdons—with coffee-pots and beer-jugs, and urns and
mugs, and epergnes and biscuit-holders, when there were
quite enough before, and in this day of ninc-carat
“ gold,” and bewitched tin masquerading as solid silver,
the housewife who prides herself on her side-boards often
verges on tears as she sees the loom of the brass on the
lid of the trophy tea-pot, and daren’t relegate it to the
kitchen or the dust-box for fear of hurting dear Harry’s
feelings. The “ girls ” in one family which suffers under
an amateur who returns every Saturday in the season
with some new aggravation in silver frost and solder,
have to turn to every week and scour up the gathering
trophies which the housemaid refuses to “do.” “And
it’s spoiling our hands for nothing,” complained one
recently, “ for George won’t have them used, and when
by chance he wins a bangle or anything useful to us he
doesn’t even bring it home but gives it away to some girl
or other.”
In the “Idler”—a strictly society drama in which
everybody falls in love with everybody else—Olga Nether-
sole as Lady Harding wears three nice frocks which are
not even alluded to in the bill. In Act 1, a “ Toreador ”
promenade dress of pumpkin-green silk, the front of
bodice and skirt of cream-satin finished at the feet with a
hem of brown velvet surmounted by a Gothic pattern in
gold guipure braid, a pointed belt of the braid, the liodice
fastened with a treble row of fancy buttons; Toreador
hat in white straw and cream ribbon. In Act 2, a ball-
gown in sunflower-yellow satin embossed with large
bouquets of flowers at wide intervals ; the overdress
slashed at the side over a panel of yellow velvet which
goes up on to the bodice forming the peaked sleevelets
and the edge-finish on the corsage ; yellow shoes, diamond
brooches and a bouquet of mauve and white flowers
finish off the get-up. In this act the new importa-
tion, Mary Kingsley (who suggests Helen Kinnaird pared
down), wears a pretty fairy frock (insufficiently padded at
the bowsprit) of cloudlike mauve chiffon and silk fastened
across the bodice A la Grecquc and caught with stage
diamonds and trails of westeria, while Watt-Tanner is
radiant in peacock-green plush and Enima Gwynnc looks’
as if she had fallen a Victim to The “ fatal skirt with
material for bodice” in a dreadful gown of black and
blue. Act 3 reveals Miss Nethersolo in a perfectly be-
witching butterfly ball-dress. The gown proper is of grey
satin .with the front,. covered with .block spotted net
caught here and there with three large jet butterflies;
the whole front of the bodice is a.largc jet butterfly ; the
demi-train if covered in black lace and finished with a
ruche of black and silvpr. With this (In U worn a long 1
grey caped cloak trimmed with ermine and lined wit!

time to change their clothes, and the virtuous heroine in
black is only once seen without a hat. In front, Miss
Nellie Hill, in a fairy-like toilette of pink and eau-de nil
with a pink poppy in her hair, was one of a party in an
O.P. box, but the rest was chaos and walking costumes.
Quite a festive air was lent to the Garrick on 3rd inst.
by Mrs. Burdekin’s octagonal theatre party—four ladies
and four gentlemen. Mrs. Burdekin wore heliotrope silk
veiled in thick, cream lace, the bodice having zouaves of
the silk, cluster of pale-pink roses and ferns on the left
shoulder and pearl and moonstone necklace ; Miss Bur-
dekin wore elephant’s breath grey voile with grey velvet
belt, en Suisse, the corsage softened by pale-blue chiffon
frills ; Miss Broomfield was in grey brocade and net and
scarlet fan, and poppies on the shoulder ; the other lady
in the party in bright rose-pink voile and silk with
Empire sash of spring green. In the circle a recent bride
was decolette in scarlet silk ; a society matron not exactly
of a fasting habit wore a black bodice beaded all over and
relieved with a frontal scarf of pink chiffon ; and a bean-
pole damsel, with Jersey hair dressed A la sky-terrier,
waved her elbows wildly about on top of the velvet-
stuffed balustrade as if she was carving a tough turkey.
The Earl of Jersey goes to Penrith on 14th inst. (as a
sort of vice-regal Valentine) to turn on the new water-
works in the capital of the Nepean. The usual alleged
rejoicings will take place, after which the Earl will
return to Sydney.
A party of folks fresh from England who had just
returned from a trip to the Mountains were gushing over
the beautiful scenery when one of them ecstatically
exclaimed; “But, oh! the beef at Katoomba! I don’t
think I have ever tasted such meat since I left England.
Why, the undercut was just like a solid mouthful of
gravy.” Oh 1 those awful English women 1 I wonder how
many of them allow their love of the beautiful to exceed
their anxiety for their creature comforts. I don’t think
I shall ever again view the natural beauties of the azure
mountains without thinking of undercut and gravy.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH
Over fifty frolicsome juveniles assembled at “ Caris-
brooke,” Waverley, the residence of Mr. R. G. Watkins,
on 27th ult.— the date of the birthday of their eldest
daughter, Miss Maude Watkins, who was the little hostess
of the festivities, which passed off very merrily. Many
pretty frocks were worn by the small guests.
On the evening of the 4th inst., the Mayor of Sydney
and Mrs. Burdekin gave a successful gipsying up Middle
Harbour in the Government steam launch “ Premier,”
with Mr. Shaw Stewart, M.P., and Lady Shaw Stewart
(who have now gone on to China), as the lions of the
occasion ; Captain “ Chumley ” and Mr. Goschen were
also present. Dancing to a good string band was the
amusement after “ high tea” had been discussed, and a
start for town was made at 10 p.m.
The engagement of Miss Amy Noyes, daughter of Dr.

thither by the quiet ceremonies attendant on the mar-
riage of Miss Kelly, daughter of Mr. T. Kelly, of By rock
station, Bourke, to Mr. Francis Dillon Bell, eldest son of
the Agent-General for New Zealand. The bridal gown
was of ivory faille Francaise, chiffon and orange blossoms,
with diamond swallow brooch (a gift from papa), the one
bridesmaid also wearing white, with gauze hat trimmed
with ostrich feathers. The wedding breakfast was served
at the Hotel Metropole, after which Mr. and Mrs. Dillon
Bell left for the honeymoon, the bride travelling in cocoa-

tered, full-sized half-bottles. Ask for the Old
Uam-Var in special keg or bottle, and see that
you get it.
Captain Rossi claims to have entertained
nine Governors of N.S. Wales at Rossiville,
beginning with Sir Richard Bourke and ending
with “Jarsey.” tte provides a totally different
entertainment for bishops.
Dr. Oswald Keatinge, now before Sydney
bench on a charge of criminal assault, lately
wrote an article on the “ Succession to the
Papacy,” which is extensively quoted from in the
current number of the Review ok Reviews.
“How on earth does he'manage it?”
That is a question we have often heard asked
concerning men who on small salaries gave
rekerky entertainments. Those men, we have
found, always “did it ”in one way—a way which
ultimately meant skipping to Honolulu in an
unobtrusive coal-ship or being taken to prison by
the ear.
As Mr. Traill, M.L.A., points out, Post-
master-General O'Connor has committed a gross
act of injustice in impounding certain copies of
the Sydney Referee, which did not comply with
the provisions of the N.S.W. Postal Act, whilst
allosving two flagrant, because deliberate, offences
against the Act by the powerful Sydney Mail —
i.c., the S.M. Herald— proprietary, to pass un-
noticed. Mr. O’Connor may have been technically
right in refusing the Referee transmission on
tins occasion, though the paper’s offence was
trivial and obviously inadvertent, but his action
in making a distinction between the two papers
is more worthy of Russia or of Ireland than of
Australia.
A London gardener was recently fined for
driving to market in an unlicensed cart. When the
magistrate heard that the man’s wife and child had
also been in the cart, he recalled the case and told
the poor gardener that he had rendered himself
criminally liable to a term of imprisonment.
“ How were my wife and child to do the journey?”
urged this audacious rascal. “Go in some other
vehicle or walk,” replied the beak. Another case
was that of a costermonger who used his licensed
coster’s barrow to drive his family to see some
races. The Bench held that by thus converting
his licensed barrow into a family equipage he had
transformed it into a carriage, and the coster was
duly fined, in accordance with law.
The Central Australian hints that there
are probabilities of a coalition between Parkes
and Dibbs on the questions of “ Federation, inter-
colonial Freetrade, and 'ad valorem against the
world,” thus enabling the Old Un to dish Bruce
Smith, M'Millan and Co. In which event (adds
the same prophet) “ Brunker, who secretly aspires
to the Premiership, will open the gates of Adiilmn
(sic) to the discontents, and surround himself
with the young men of the Parliament, and stump
the country on Australian Nationalism, the rights
•of labor, and ad valorem revenue, and opposition
to Federation, and we think he will about win.
Parkes will then get a pension and Dibbs be made
Aarent-General ” and William Nicholas W.illis
will be mister of Lands with, the reversion of
tin l Premiership in his pocket ! Hev !

Writing hurriedly of “Arrah-na-Pogue”
last week, the name of Grattan Riggs was
entirely omitted. The slight was unintentional,
“ Arrah ” without Riggs would resemble water
without whisky. “The Irish Detective,” a wild
phantasmagoria that every one has seen and
revelled in, was set up at Sydney Royal before a
big audience on Saturday night. The evergreen
Grattan was followed through the seven Riggs-out
that he assumes so faithfully in costume, dialect,
gesture, and every other particular, with keen
interest and howls of laughter. Robt. Inman
was a capital Hoyt, and Capt. de Burgh played
Richard Stockpot, the appropriately named gentle-
men who eventually gets into the soup, with a
ponderous unctuousness that suggested “turtle.’
The Jim Thug of Chas. Seagrave is a clever
impersonation, perhaps more on the lines of Seven
Dials than those of the Bowery. Dick Stewart
and A. G. Boulton are both amusing in different
ways, but the ladies, all round, are disappointing,
and Maud Appleton failed to deepen the impres
sion made by her Arrah. “Eileen Oge,” an
Irish drama, by Edmund Falconer (we saw it in
the English provinces in 72, we think, with
O'Grady in the lead), will be staged on Saturday
night. Next week, it is worthy of note, there
will be three Irish dramas running in Sydney,
two by Boucicault.

There is some pretty writing in “Com-
rades,” but it is based on and bolstered up by im-
probabilities, and, therefore, ill-calculated to
stand the wear and tear of a long run. Dot
Boucicault is particularly fine as Stirrup, the
veteran soldier, and little fault can be found with
the acting of Geo. Titheradge, Arthur Laui’ence,
Miss Romer and Mrs. Brough, while Owen
Harris’ make-up as the {esthete is a marvel, but
Percy Lyndal is too aggravatingly cool and
sweetly pretty. Frank Cates is all right as an
elderly masher, but he can’t look at heavy, old
men, he lacks the breadth, repose and weight
necessary, and plays with a thin-edged jerki-
ness that cuts off sympathy and tells
every girl in front that he’s single. There
is a delicious bit of love-making between Mrs
Brough and Titheradge, followed by proposal and
acceptance that fascinated the house the other
evening. But the lady retreated w ithout “ sealing
the engagement,” and a profound gloom settled
over the powdered bosom of the circle, till she
paused, leftcentre, and looked backwith eyesofin-
vitation. A soul-satisfying, heart-tingling “cheep”
was presently heard and, just as the dowagers
were about to settle themselves contentedly, a
little lady said in a clear, innocent voice, “Oh,
wasn’t that nice?” and then everybody laughed
and liked her for saying it, because she just voiced
the unspoken thought of the entire audience,
“ The Jilt,” a five-act Irish play by the late
Dion Boucicault, will be revived on Saturday
night.

“ The Icuer ” improves on acquaintance.
The author has culled his inspiration from various
sources. For instance, when Strong proposes to
Kate, she affects to be nonplussed and asks him
what she should say. Whereupon he chirps out —
“Don’t know ; had no experience, but if you were
to say ‘Yes, Simeon,’and let me kiss you, I’d
reckon it a good start.” Everyman is familiar
with the yarn from which this speech is adapted.
Throughout, expressions crop up reminiscent of
digging days, and some of its most epigram-
matic lines, for instance, “Failure is the un-
pardonable sin,” are familiar as copy-book
headings. The third act is the brightest
and most vigorous, yet the most highly
finished. It is full of finely-conceived, well-
worked-out scenes. That where Cross induces
Strong to write the letter exonerating Harding is
acted for all it’s worth on both sides, and is fol-
lowed by a strong situation, in which Helen’s
appeal to Cross’s better nature is something to be
remembered, but the act is not then let down, for
the encounter between Harding and the would-be
seducer of his wife fully sustains the interest. As
the Idler, Charles Cartwright has a strained and
incoherent character to handle, one that is right
against human sympathy, and doesn’t fit him, and
in which the measuredness of his intonation is
more unpleasantly apparent than in his previous
Sydney appearances; yet, no one can fail to be
impressed with the ease, power, and finish of the
impersonation. As for Olga Nethersole, her
pathos has the true ring, and strikes a responsive
chord every time, but the part, as Lily Langtry
foresaw, w r ants writing up before it comes within
the category of “star’’parts. “The Idler” will
be withdrawn in the bloom of success in order
that the company may have a fortnight’s Mel-
bourne rehearsal of “The Fortune of War.”
Annis Montague and Charles Turner, after an
absence from the Sydney stage of seven years,
appear on Saturday in “Maritana,” one of their
former triumphs. They will be followed some
time in March by Johnny Sheridan, who will be
ousted by Janet Achurch on the 7th of May.

At Sydney Her Majesty’s the pantomime
is still running to big business. The closing per-
formance (the fiftieth) will be given on Saturday
night, when every paying entrant will receive
a souvenir, ranging in value from Is. to £2O.
“Arrah-na-Pogue” will be put up on Monday,
just to show that George Rignold has a will of
his own, when he will play Shaun. Maggie
Moore, of course, plays Arrah; Harry Jewett,
Michael Feeney; Arthur Greenaway, the McCoull;
“Jack” Sweeney, O'Grady Jim ” Hazlitt,
Coffin ; Edith Bland, Fanny Power: and Marian
Melville, Kitty Walsh.

A bumper house greeted Harry Rickards’
return to the Teatro de Foli, otherwise known as
the Sydney Gaiety. The company has been
strengthened by the inclusion of Daieui, a very
clever ventriloquist, and Ruth Wallace, who,
attired ss Britannia, sings a Federation song and
waves tli ■ Union .la k, while a little tot, arrayed
chiefly in native loveliness, displays the banm v of
the Southern Cross. Harry’s new song, “Hi
Tiddly Hi Ti,” is very fetching, but when lie had
finished, the yells for the “ Bridge,” a song he's
lx en singing straight ahead for IK months, were


deafening, and when he capitulated and came on
m the fitting costume, he received an ovation,
ihe house has been completely renovated, and
looks as bright as a new bob. Matinee on Satur-
day. .Prices popular.

( Sydney School of Arts, the Vaudeville
Company has been strengthened by the inclusion
pf Ohas. Hugo and Priscilla Verne. Little
Jrnoebe .Levy has introduced a skipping-rope
dance, she also sings. If she acquires many more
accomplishments she will constitute a whole
variety show in herself. Business is all right.

flavoured by fine weather and fair winds,
I ernandez made a third successful drop from the
sky on Saturday last, and will go up and down
again (W.P.) next Saturday. Bondi is becoming
very popular ; for example, read this
“ Wild America ” is doing enormous busi-
ness at Moore Park, and night has gained another
horror, for the larrikins of the neighbourhood
have picked up the Indian yells and war-cries. A
big boom in “ blood-curdlers ” is reported, and
Trapper Tom, or the Sioux Squaw of the Sus-
quehana,” is in great demand. Other tokens of
the prairie fever are also evinced in the assiduity
with which fowls and goats are lassooed by wild-
eyed lads armed with clothes-lines. One peculiar
thing about the show is the resemblance of the
Indians’ musical festival to a Salvation Army
gathering. The entertainment is one of the most
novel that Sydney has seen for years, but Dr.
Carver’s shooting is its most wonderful, if most
familiar, feature. The entrepreneur is showing
his level-headedness by preparing to take a “Wild
Australia” back to the States with him. The
Wirths have skipped to Brisbane.

The two great swordsmen, Parker and
Donovan, meet next Saturday at Coogee Aquarium
for the mounted swordsman championship of the
world and a purse. Captain M'Murdo will
referee the battle, and should it not be carried on
to his satisfaction, the prize will be withheld.
Manager Larmour informs us that they will meet
on foot the Saturday following, when Seguy is
expected also to chip in.

We’ve said all the nice things we know

“Skipped by the Light of the Moon,” as
revived at Melbourne Opera House on Saturday
night, is a selection from the old familiar aggre-
gation of lunacies, redecorated by a company
well fitted to paint the turnip and gild unrefined
folly. Written for the Cirards, whose dramatic
talents soared about as high as they could kick,
“Skipped” formerly based its chief claim to
intellectual favour upon a wild chase round an
oyster-stall, and the measure of its success was
regulated by the ease and rapidity with which
the leading characters fell out of windows, or
toppled off a shaky garden wall. John Gourlay
introduced the thing to Australia in a slightly
improved form, and now, in conjunction with
Snazelle, he has worked up an entertainment
that has strong pretensions to the title of musical
comedy. Many of the new items, particularly
Snazelle’s drinking song and his rendering of the
Mephistopheles serenade from “Faust,” are ex-
cellent in themselves, and everything not new is
better presented than of yore—Gourlay’s own
grotesque performance not excepted. John
Forde, Henry Hudson, Aggie Kelton and Bessie
Vivian all participate freely in this wild, un-
trammelled joke, while Florence Fsdaile and
Lena Salenger came out stronger in the musical
than in the comedy direction. “ Skipped ” was
well received on Saturday, and with half a dozen
members of the late Nellie Stewart company
figuring on the bill it is bound to run awhile.
** * *
The Princess’s “Ida” is only out for
six nights, and the wisdom in withdrawing
“lolanthe ” to make room for this least tuneful of
the G. and S. operas was not made glaringly
apparent on Saturday. At no time a very power-
ful “ draw,” the show is hardly so attractive now
as of yore, but considering that Elton, Vernon,
and Leumane play their original characters, and
that Clara _ Merivale speaks the name-part
better than either Miss Colborne-Baber or Nellie
Stewart used to, there is little to find fault with in
thecast. Riley, as the baritone intruder upon
maiden retirement is more than usually suggestive
of poor Federici, who made his Australian debut
in the same capacity. Federici, however, used
to hurl his fascinations at the house in general,
whereas the more perfunctory Riley has a trick
of rolling his eyes at the private boxes, and per-
mitting his attention to wander listlessly round
the dress-circle. For the rest Miss Elsie Cameron
fails to develope any fresh meaning from the dull
song concerning the Mighty Must and Inevitable
Shall, and the heartiest laugh of the evening falls
to those three warriors who shed their glittering
accoutrements on the assumption that a man
must be an ass to fight in a cuirass. On Satur-
day (14th) a first revival of “The Yoeman of the
Guard ” is likely, for sundry reasons, to be better
received than was the first production of that
grand but gaudy work.
** * *
The Alexandra also promises an interest-
ing event for St. Valentine’s L>ay, as Dampier
makes a point of naming the anniversary of a for-
gotten festival. On this occasion Cupid’s dis-
credited agent is expected to incline the hearts of
young men and maidens towards “ The Miner’s
Right,” a drama which has been a long time pre-
paring for a fell swoop upon the sympathies of all
who believe that Australian literature is worthy
to he a profit in its own country. Meanwhile,
“The Black Flag” is dying hard to the accom-
paniment of a shrill gallery whistle.
** * *
“Doctor Bill,” at the Bijou, seems to go
with increasing velocity, and the spectacle of a
strong man in hysterics being carried bodily away
to the nearest pump is quite common in front.
For hilarious individuals like this a second dose
of “ Doctor Bill" is earnestly recommended. The
hollowness of all human mirth is soon apparent
to any man who comes up smiling for another look
at the acrobatic comedy, for after sitting it out to
the bitter end he rushes home to ask himself what
he meant by enjoying nothing at all the first time.
Yet “Doctor Bill ” is a success everywhere, a
fact which proves that a thin veneer of fun cleverly
placed on the commonest dramatic wood will sell
as well, or better, than the fine, ingrained humour
of articles like “Dandy Dick.” Anson and one
or two of the others are now clowning their parts,
and the roar of the groundlings at each fresh
variety of kick is something to be heard—and
pondered over.

A second edition of “Aladdin” introduc*
ing new songs and dances, communicates a little
fresh life to matters at the Royal. On Friday
(13th) Jennie Lee takes a benefit and before the
season closes it is to be hoped that the employees

the Firm.

Elsewhere matters incline to quietude, or,
in some cases, to gloom. The loud phons. at the
Waxworks, being an audible improvement on the
former Punch and Judy reproducer of the human
voice, are treated with respect. The Gaiety and
Victoria Halls fetch them in as well as can be
expected, but Madame Cora, at St. George’s,
ought to trot her little show around the bush and
try her mesmeric powers upon the rabbits without
delay. By the time Madame has chosen her com-
mittee of investigation there is precious little
audience left to behold how she can fascinate the
grinning larrikin (probably at a “bob” a night)
with her glittering eye,

The Williamson and Garner lease of Mel-
bourne Royal expires in June, when, as now seems
almost certain, business will be carried on by a
Limited Company, consisting solely, or mainly, of
shareholders in the property, with George Coppin
and Dick Stewart as managing directors. The
veterans have already unfurled their banner, in
the form of a prospectus, and the necessary
capital is rolling up to support a venture which
will smack of the “good old days” with the per-
feshun in particular and the public in general. A
provisional tender for redecorating the house at a
cost of £2OOO has already been accepted, the very
best of scene-painting talent is willin’, and the old
Royal has a notion of resuming its proper social
position in about four months time. As Rignold
might observe —Once more into the breach,, dear
friends—old Harry ! Coppin ! and by George I
BONDIAROLLCAI BALLAD.
Of all the days I loves the one
’Twixt Saturday and Mondi,
For that’s the day I meets my tart,
And takes her down to Bondi.

Or cribs of which they’re fond, I
Cannot forget, my oath ! could ye ?

While I, when asked to take a drink,
The voice ’ave to respond, I
Shall alius down it with a wink,
And say—’Ere’s luck to Bondi.

Holland, the showman, in his new Reminiscences, has
a funny bit about his apprenticeship to the drapery.
‘ Selling Off” and “Alarming Sacrifice” having failed
Mr. Giltgore decided to bring off a wreck, the first thinf
being to whitewash the windows, leaving only a few
finger-streaks tor the women to peep through, whereupon
a crowd gathered continually. Cheap goods were bought
and strewn over with seaweed in a most appetising way
while a diver walked up and down the shop in his cos-
tume, lecturing, “ Yes, mum, well do I remember that
’ere bit of calico. I was just a-draggin’ of it out when up
comes a monstrous shark. I outs with my knife,” &c.
“Dramaticus” writes that while J. C. M. Bellew had
much to do with Fechter’s Hamlet, the inspiration more
likely came, in the first instance, from Charley Dillon.
The latter’s Belphegor was a revelation, amid the tradi-
tional work of Phelps, Ohas. Kean, Vandenhoff, Creswick,
and Anderson, and then his purely natural Othello hit
hard, anticipating Fechter’s busines's in that part. Dillon
was the man who proved that the London public wanted
natural acting, wherefore Brooke did not go down, on his
return from Australia.
We got hold of a book the other day professing to
explain Robert Heller’s and Haidee Heller’s Second
Sight, and it started us sighting after Bob in the Empy-
rean. His name was Palmer, and Haidee was Rebecca
Isaacs. She much scandalised a fashionable Melbourne
fancy ball crowd by going in the full evening dress of a
gentleman. Now-a-days it mightn’t matter. The Second
Sight cannot all be explained by signals—must be hyp-
notic.
The following is about the order of the longest London
runs: “Our Boys,” “Sweet Lavender,” “Mikado,”
“ Private Secretary,” “ Pinafore,” “Dorothy,” “ Ticket of
Leave Man,” “Cloches de Corneville,” “ Our American
Cousin,” “Colleen Bawn,” “Genevieve de Brabant,”
“ New Babylon,” but nothing got within cooey of “Our
Boys.”
Newnes got up a howling advertisement for his rag,
Titbits, at Christmas. He advertised for seven bald-
headed men, to sit in a row in the stalls, Drurv Lane
Theatre, Boxing Night, their heads lettered as follows:
T-i-t-b-i-t-8, but Gus Harris got madness, and swore it
shouldn’t be. The baldies were to be provided with free
tickets, and presented with dress-suits, also half-a-guinea
a nob. Didn’t come off—but the “ ad.” did.
A most impudent lecture was given in Manchester, the
other night, by Showman Holland, the waxy-moustached
Napoleonic caterer of the Surrey Alhambra, and good-
ness knows where, who fairly bangs Barnum on his own
brag. His Baby-Show attracted 2700 sucklings, and for
a boss baby he dressed up a dwarf, 35 years old, but only
feet high, over whom the women slobbered, at a res-
pectful distance, as he lay muling and puking in the
nurse’s arms, but some women found dwarfy, in his baby
clothes, smoking a pipe, and drinking a pewter of beer,
behind the scenes. Another of Holland’s dodges was
renting the vast Agricultural Hall, and opening it as
Holland’s Hippodrome, when he took over £3OOO the
opening day, a Boxing Day, although he entered on the
lesseeship without any horses or circus-men, trusting to
the luck of picking up what stray ones were about. Then he
dropped £7OOO in one week over some bulls which w ouldn’t
fight, though he says he gave £BOO each for them, and
had to sell them for £4 for butcher’s meat.
Minnie Palmer and “ Yours merrily, John Rogers,”
have finally separated, on the basis, it is stated in New
York, of equally sharing Minnie’s property, worth
£15,000.
Gilbert and Sullivan’s “ lolauthe ” has been successfully

Forty-six years ago George Ooppin made his first ap

In the Greenwood Cemetery, New York, one of the
most beautiful burying-plaees in the world, there is a
neglected grave, grown over with a tangle of w-eeds and
tall rank grasses. On the headstone is the inscription,
“Sacred to the memory of Eliza Gilbert.” Few people
are aw'are that beneath lie the remains of the once famous
Lola Montez.
Some happy verses to L. J. Lohr, “ the genial one,’

It is said that Moliere objected to seeing his name
printed in large type on the playbill. Some modern
“author-actors” would only consent to having their
names in small type on condition that nobody else’sname
was to appear at all.
“ Remember that the demand for sheer inanity is ably
and amply catered for at the Adelphi and Drury Lane,”
says the dramatic critic of The World. Those two
theatres supply the Australian market with most of its
melodramas.
The Weekly Lorgnette, after announcing that it was
sick of theatrical ingratitude, and would witch the world
no more, now informs disconsolate friends and admirers
that if is iK - -load, but “resting.” Also, the Lorgnette
leaves those individuals who make merry "over what
they please to consider our (the L.’s) downfall, to wallow-
in their own mire.” Serve them right for considering
that any paper which never gets on its logs can possibly
have a downfall.
A daughter of the late Charles Young, the comedian -
by his second wife-was married at All Saints’, Wool-
lahra, last week, to Mr. Herbert Edward Johnson, of
Birmingham, England. “Charlie” Young, one of the
most capable actors Australia has ever seen, died at his
residence, Museum Hotel, William street, Sydney, Jan
21, 1871
Sardou’s new drama, “ Thermidor,” which all this fuss
and shine is about, deals with the adventures of an his-
torical character, an actor named La Brassiere. Affiliated
with the Committee of Public Safety he saved the lives of
indiscreet Thespian comrades, amid them M. Fleury and
Mdlle. de Raucourt. Collot d’Herbois, a sanguinary
Revolutionist, was a retired actor, and it is said his guil-
lotining atrocities at Lyons were prompted by his having
been hissed there.
“Iconoclast” writes:—“l’m getting just sick of the
persistent repetition of the history of that really able
Australian actress, Miss Admirable Gingall. The fact of
her appearing in a pantomime very many years ago
cannot be got over, and so it is put as 16 years instead of
18 years. Many remember the occasion, with Miss
Admirable (then an infant), the biggest young lady in the
whole crowd, disporting a very fine bracelet. A philo-
sopher says the admixture of a lie doth ever give pleasure,
but please don’t keep rubbing it in—these things are to
be done with a feathery touch.”
Mrs. Brown-Potter’s mascotte is a fragment of the rope
with which a man was hanged. An old French supersti-
tion asserts that this pleasing little memento always
brings good luck, and consequently the Potter keeps her
specimen sewn in her corset, and the world goes well with
her in consequence. It occurs to us that the male
Brown-Potter wants about 18 feet of rope to bring him
any good fortune worth mentioning.
The friends of W. H. Williams, an old identity in the
Melbourne printing and publishing business, and one of
the fathers of the Metropolitan Liedertafel, are endeavour-
ing to arrange a testimonial and benefit concert for that
weary fragment. The alleged connection of Mr. Williams
with “the establishment of a Victorian literature” is
open to question, but his association with music down
South has been long, strong and altogether worthy of
recognition, more especially as he was always too ready
to let the musician stand in the printer’s light. Con-
sidering, however, that the veteran is supposed to have
special claims upon the Masons, it is remarkable that
they should sanction the present appeal to the general
public, and there seems little use in a man’s devotion to
a mystic brotherhood which allows him to feel the grip of
impecuniosity in his declining years.

Speaking of Madame Cora, the mesmerist, the Age
wisely observes: “None of the hypnotised individuals
could have been confederates, as they would not have
appeared so vacant-minded or have fallen about im-
promptu with such abandon,” This seems eminently
probable, when you look at it. Also the bank-embezzler
who disappeared lately couldn’t have been the real
criminal for he himself acknowledged that he didn’t take
the money, and besides he frankly admitted that he was
dead, so that it was no good looking after him. And
even the Premier Permanent directors reluctantly
allowed the fact to leak out that none of them were re-
sponsible, and that they were all as innocent as a new-laid
egg, and much as they wanted to go to gaol they felt that
they couldn’t conscientiously take up space 'that they
weren’t entitled to.
Joseph Austin Carroll and Emma Wangenheim Carroll
have filed their little shovel on petition of their creditors
who are described generally as “ Thespians.” Liabilities,

Messrs. C. B. Hicks & Herbert, sub-lessees of Brisbane Opera

Charles Hawtrey has a habit of lolling round looking
vacantly at nothing in particular. Thus engaged one
evening, a haughty stranger approaching mistook him for
an attendant, and, presenting his ticket, said rather
imperiously, “My stall is No. 23.” Hawtrey, awakening
from his reverie, answered with a bland smile, “ I am
awfully glad to hear it, and now tell me how is your
wife ?”
Johnny Sheridan, who went to Maoriland to fill the
Potter-Bellew dates, is doing such big biz. (beating the
Opera, Warner, and Toole records) that he extends the
season everywhere. He travels with a big company, 32
in number, and a full ballet. That’s the secret! He is
playing Napier now, and commences a three weeks’
season in Auckland on February 16.
At a New York theatre there was an old scene-shifter
named Jackson, who, during one of Jefferson’s absences
died. On Jefferson’s return he asked the master car-
penter where Jackson was. The carpenter, with a sor-
rowful look, pointed upwards and said, quietly, “I guess
he’s shifting clouds.”
The N.Y. Actors’ Association has adopted the following
eminently sensible rule“ It shall not be allowable fin-
ally member while in the club-house to talk more than 40
consecutive minutes about himself or his histrionic
triumphs and experiences, unless it shall so happen that
there is no other member present who wishes to talk about
himself and his histrionic triumphs and experiences.”
Sir Arthur Sullivan’s grand opera, “ Tvanhoe,” at
D’Oyly Carte’s new theatre, is a great success. It has a
double cast of the leading parts, because the work is too
hard for the same people every night, and is a heavy pro-
duction of the Verdi or Meyerbeer class.
Dramaticus writes: “I’ve only met Toole twice in the
Melbourne streets, once just after his first landing, and
the second time just on the eve of his final departure.
Meanwhile, he has improved in appearance out of all
knowing, for when he came he looked like the Fasting
Man on Day 27.
Snazelle is of a melancholy turn, like Liston and Buck*
stone, who wanted to act tragic parts, and Snazzy finds it
most sickenin’ to be identified with low comedy biz. Yet
he is in for it again, chained to Johnny Gourlav, in
“Skipped by the Light of the Moon.” Snazelle
likes “Nazareth” with the harmonium, but, above all,
to be wiring away at grand opera, just the same weakness
as Verdi Green, never happy but of Nelusko, or something
like that.
The long and curious intimacy between Lily Langtry
and Fred. Gebhardt seems to have been interrupted for
ever. The relations were strained at the time Langtry
last left America, but when Gebhardt heard that the fair
creature was ill in London he started at once across the
ocean, determined to effect a reconciliation. As soon as
he got to London he hastened to call on Langtry. As
luck would have it, he arrived at her hotel at the very
tune when the Prince of Wales was paying his respects to
the lady. His card was returned with the message that
he would have to wait awhile—that Mrs. Langtry could
receive no other visitor while Turn was calling. Words
would fail to convey even an idea of the intensity of Mr.
Gebhardt’s wrath; he flounced out of the hotel, went
hack to his own rooms, packed his luggage, and started
for Liverpool by the first train. With this touching inci-
dent ended the flirtation which for years has been a
notorious and flagrant scandal. Gebhardt has betaken
himself to the sports of the turf, and Langtry is losing
her money in London trying to make people believe she
can act.

Mrs. Potter and her beautiful Bellew had such a poor
house at opening in the Public Hall, Colombo, that they
refused to show. Then, Kyrle wrote to explain that their
non-appearance was due to the fact that a local speculator

At latest dates they were appearing at the Floral Hall;

YOUTH AND AGE.
When all the world is young, lad, and all the trees are
green,
And every goose a swan, lad, and every lass a queen,
Then, hey for boot and horse, lad, and ride the world
away;
Young blood must have its course, lad, and every dog his
day.
When all the world is old, lad, and all the trees are
brown,
And all the sport is stale, lad, and all the wheels run
down;
Creep home and take thy place there, thy early friends
among ;
God grant you find one face there you lov'd when all was
young.

SKETCHES FROM A LIFE OF ACTION.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
m.
Having seen the Constitution in full
operation, Grey applied to the Imperial Govern-
ment for temporary leaveof absence, andon the olst
December, 1853, he left New Zealand after eight
years of vigorous and able government, during
which time he had ruled Europeans and natives
with all but absolute power. .
He was, however, not long left to enjoy his
otinm cum dignitate in England. Troubles had
broken out at the Cape, with which the Governor
of that colony was quite unable to cope, and Sir
George Grey’s remarkable success in dealing with
the Maoris pointed to him as a fitting person to
overcome the South African difficulty.
The situation was peculiar. The great Jvafhr
chief, Krielie, determined to destroy foreign
dominion, had schemed for the initiation of a
war of extermination against the colonists. His
plan was to strip his people of all their cattle, to
destroy all their corn, and prohibit cultivation in
every form, and then, when they were all driven
mad with hunger, to launch them on the settle-
ments in a struggle for existence. As a pre-
liminary he had secured the co-operation of all the
rain-doctors; and a prophet of renown took up
the parable, which was re-echoed by all the rest,
that cultivation must forthwith cease, har-
vested crops be destroyed, the land de-
vastated, and all the cattle killed. This
would be followed, it was prophesied, by
a resurrection of all the cattle, together
with the cattle of their ancestors, all greatly im-
proved in size and quality and countless in
numbers. All who obeyed and followed the com-
mand of the prophet by killing their cattle, should
feed tor the rest of their lives on unlimited beef;
but the disobedient would be turned into moths.
These mandates from Heaven were obeyed to
the letter; the cattle were slain, the whole
country denuded and desolated and the colonists
thrown into the wildest state of alarm. Sir George
Grey was, in 1855, hastily appointed Governor of
the Cape, and despatched from England specially
to meet the emergency. As with the Maoris, he
first marshalled his forces, saw that his powder
was dry, and then turned his attention to settling
the difficulty once and for all with the least
possible bloodshed. Having secured communica-
tions and defended points most open to attack, the
Governor next proceeded to deal more immediately
with Krielie's tribe. He there found the Kaffirs
starving by thousands, and in no state to pour
into the settlements as devastating warriors.
Instead of fighting these wretched victims of
superstition. Sir George wisely fed them. He
sent them copious supplies, and was soon able to
dictate terms of peace to the haughty old chief
without firing a shot. By treaty lie obtained
from Krielie all the fine country lying between tin-
Great Kie River and the River Guabakka, known
as Fingo-land.
# ♦ *
One of the greatest services rendered to
the natives by Grey w r as the establishment and
partial endowment of Loved ale. A native school
was about to be established there under Presby-
terian auspices. The Governor called on the pro-
moters and pointed out to them how very little
influence for good, beyond the immediate welfare
of the actual inmates of the school, would attend
mere book instruction, whether religious or
secular. On the other hand he contended that by
the establishment of workshops and the appoint-
ment of instructors in various branches of manu-
facturing industries, the good effected would be
distributed through the whole community. He
expressed his willingness, if his views were
adopted, to pay the main coat of the buildings
and workshops, and to guarantee the payment of
£2)00 per annum during the term of his Governor-
ship. The school w r as built and endowed accord-
ingly’— and run on purely undenominational lines,
while technical instruction in all branches was
imparted to young Kaffirs.
In 1880 a book was issued from this establish-
ment giving the names and the after fortunes of
10,000 Kaffirs who, having been instructed in
different branches of trade at had been
distributed all over South Africa in the exercise of
their divers trades. Sir George Grey, to whom a
copy of the book was sent w ith a suitable letter,
declared that the jicrusal of it had afforded him
more pleasure than any event of the last few years
that he could call to mind.
At the same time he also endowed an Industrial
School for natives at Healdtown under Wesleyan
management. The Government paid £7OOO for
building purposes and endowed it with £lOOO per
annum. . ,
When Grey left the Capo again to assume the
Governorship of New Zealand, in 1861, his suc-
cessor partially withdrew’ this Government appro-
priation. Healdtown, under money-grubbing
“religious ” management —the mercenary mission
system —at once collapsed. Lovedale is still car-
ried on and continues to flourish, having an
average attendance of 400 Kaffir scholars.
• • •
Towards the end of the Crimean War the
English Government raised a large force of Ger-
mans for military service, and, on the war sud-
denly ceasing soon after the enrolment of these
men, agreed to give such as desired it, in lieu of
. other compensation or continuance of pay, free
passages to the Cape and grants of land in that
colony. Large numbers accepted the offer, but, on
their arrival at the Cape, Grey declined to place
them on the land, except under certain conditions.
lie explained that the men constituted the very
I Hist class of immigrants, provided they were
afforded opportunities for banning family men ;
that there were no such opportunities .in the
colony, where the supply of marriageable women
was already quite inadequate to the demands, or
rather requirements, of the population, and that
lie saw nothing but incentives to vice and degrada-
tion in sending a large body of men, all in the
prime and vigour of life, away from their homes,
into a strange land, and without any possibility ol
forming family ties. He, therefore, made it a
condition of settlement that an agency should be
established for sending out the female friends and
relations of the new immigrants to join them in
the colony, under proper regulations ; and as the
men had meanwhile arrived, he sent instructions
and lists of these females, furnished by the Ger-
mans, to a Hamburg agent.
The Colonial office took serious umbrage at this,
and an angry correspondence ensued, which ended
in him being suddenly recalled to England,
nominally for another reason, but Sir George Grey
declares actually on account of this German immi-
gration business. Immediately on his arrival in
London he was met by the Hamburg agent, who
told him that the Government had refused to meet
his advances, and that unless £20,000 were placed
at his disposal the whole scheme would fall
through. Sir George, then and there, gave a
cheque for the amount on his private account,
telling the agent to take promissory-notes at long
dates from the different persons to whom the
advances were made. It is gratifying to learn
that this money was all repaid by the German
emigrants, to the last farthing.
But the most amusing part of the transaction
was that during Sir George’s voyage to England a
change of Ministry had taken place, and those in
office, when he arrived, fully approved of his
action, reversed the decision of their predecessors,
and at once reinstated him as Governor.
During .Sir Henry Loch's tour as Governor
through British Kaffraria in the early part of last
year one great feature was a procession of German
settlers in costumes illustrating the industries,
crafts, trades, &c., pursued by them. Then
principal sjiokesinan informed the Governor that
they represented the settlement which had been
founded by Grey, and that through his wise pre-
cautions they were now the most thriving body ot
settlers in British Kaffraria.
In this matter of land settlement, he states that
his policy at tin* Cape was to afford all facilities to
Civil servants of every capacity to settle down on
land with their families at the termination of
their time of service. In 1878, when he was head
of the New Zealand Ministry, Sir George pre-
pared a measure with the object of enabling Civil

servants to select land with the view of eventually
occupving it, but the defeat of Ins Ministry ana
his consequent retirement from office prevented it
from coming forward.
Sir George, therefore, proposed that any civil
servant might Is. authorised to make a selection
of land under certain conditions, and might coni-
mence improvement# on it and carry them out
even while still in the service, so preparing a
place for retirement on expiration of service.
But the selector would acquire no title to such
land until a certain number of years of occupation
intervened after his leaving the service. As a
matter of course misconduct in the service would
cause cancellation of the selection. This system
would completely do away with all claims for pen-
sions, retiring allowances, Ac.
• • •
Soon after Sir George Grey's return to the
Capo he placed himself in a position that enabled
him to perform, perhaps, the greatest service that
ever was performed by the Governor of a depen-
dency. Not the least extraordinary part of the
story is the manner in which this magnificent ser-
vice was recognised—a recognition j Kissing over
the head of the performer and bestowed on the
two persons who of all others had least to do
"(hi 29th Feb., 185fi, Lord Canning assumed office
as Governor General of India, nrc the Marquis of
Dalhousie, and soon after the gravest symptoms
of disaffection became manifest among the Sepoy
troops of the army of Hindostan. Sir George
Grey, alarmed at the indications of a general
mutiny, wrote to the Governor-General on the
subject, but the latter attached no signification to
the symptoms. On 10th May. 1857, the mutiny
broke out at Meerut, and Sir George again wrote
urging the immediate strengthening of the Euro-
pean forces at the command of the Government,
and offering to send every available maif, but
Isud Canning could not read the writing on the
wall, and declaml that with a few hundred
additional cavalry he would easily knock the
mutiny on the head. , , , .
Meanwhile, England had embarked on her
second opium war with China, and Lord Elgin
was despatched as Her Majesty’s Ambassador
Extraordinary to the Emin-ror. Ho arrived o t
Hong Kong on 2nd July, 1857. Ships of war,
gunboats* and transport-ships with several regi-
ments of troops were sent en route to China, to
back up Elgin. _ -rr
On their way they touched at the Cape. 1
Sir George Grey was now restored to the position
of Governor, and though the Governor-General ol
India was blind, the Governor of the Cape was
fully alive to the exigencies of the situation.
Fortunately, also, the officer in command of the
troops in the first transport ship which arrived in
Cape Town, Brigadier Adrian Hope (vvno shortly
afterwards fell desperately wounded at the Siege
of Lucknow) was his personal friend.
The Governor had a conference with Adrian
Hope, told him that in his opinion the mutiny had
assumed such proportions that it rendered the
employment of every European who could near
arms a matter of absolute necessity, which nan
not been foreseen when troops were being des-
patched to China, and that there was but a scanty
provision of European troops in India. He con-
fessed that though as Governor of the Cape, and
therefore Commander-in-Chief of the lorces in
that territory he had power to command move-
ments of troops within the district, he had no
power to direct movements outside of Ins com-
mand, and he put it to his friend whether, with
the later intelligence which he had received, if he
did not think that it would be for the good of the
country to divert his course from China to India.
Brigadier Adrian Hope recognised the urgency
of the situation and Sir George Grey, having
succeeded in diverting the first ship, there was
no difficulty with the remainder. the whole
China army was directed on India.
Meanwhile Lord Elgin, at Hong Kong, was
vainly awaiting the arrival of an army to back up
his demands. On the 16th July, 1857, hearing no
news of its coining, he set sail for Calcutta, where
he learned that his forces were on the march to
Delhi. The noble lord was furious. Sir George
Grey had at once written explaining the action he
had taken, and the reasons which had prompted
him ; but Lord Elgin was too indignant to vouch-
safe any reply to his letter, and made his way
back to Hong Kong, which he reached in Sep-
teinber.
Meanwhile, the great service rendered by Sir
George Grey had been promptly acknowledged in
other quarters. Lord Elphiustone, Governor of
Bombay, had declared in Council that mu-Ii prompt
action had saved India and preserved it to tlm
British Crown. The Under Secretary of the Indian
Department, Mr. Henry Laboucliere, had, by
instruction, written to Sir George, and informed
him that Her Majesty's acknowledgment of his
forethought would shortly follow in official form.
And then—Sir George Grey never heard anything
more about it.
All the papers in sup|>ort of the alvive state-
ment are now to be seen in the Manusoiipt
department of the Auckland Public Library.
Why were Sir George’s services ignored so com-
pletely, after having been so fully acknowledged I 1
In iHT>S a gentleman of the highest standing at
the Cap.- and with great political influence in
England happened to ask this question of a
Cabinet Minister in the course of an after-dinner
conversation. The answer was equally informal,
but ran as follows :
For political reasons it was necessary to retain
the services of the Governor-General. Lord Can-
ning, as Viceroy on the abolition of the East India
Company's Charter. Now, by recognising that
Sir George Grey had been more far-seeing than
Lord Canning— that the former had actually
despatched troops in despite of the latter had
Kit down a mutiny which the latter had not
ilieved in—Lord Canning’s claim to Is- con-
tinued as ruler of the Indian Empire would have
been minimised. Therefore, Sir George Greys
undoubted claims to consideration would have to
remain in abeyance for the present, but would
receive full consideration ere long.
Ere long Lord Canning died, and lo! and
behold ! Lord Elgin was selected to succeed him
as Viceroy of India. In a very short time Lord
Elgin also died. And then it became essential
that all idea of recognising Sir George Grey’s
great services in putting down the Indian Mutiny
should disapjiear from the ken of the English
Government, for it was deemed necessary to award
a large pension to the widow of the deceased earl,
and this pension wan awarded in consideration of
the distinguished services of her deceased husband
in hurryingon troops from the Cape for the sup-
pression of the Indian Mutiny !!!
Thus the Governor-General who did not believe
In the mutiny got splendid rewards Is-canse Grey
did believe in it; and the Commander-in-Chicf
who resented the despatch of Ids troops for sup-
pressing' this mutiny got a splendid reward
(through his widow) because Grey despatched
them !
* * *
Stanley had just returned from his raid
through Central Africa, and had published a por-
tion of his so-called discoveries, and Lord Salis-
bury had issued his bullying ultimatum to poor
little Portugal, when Sir George Grey said in dis-
cussing the subject
“ I suppose you remember Rumford and his
discoveries? Towards the •nd of the last century,
Rumford, an American in the service of the
Bavarian Government, announced his great dis-
covery that heat consists in motion. He was
invited to Berlin ; there was great excitement,
cannon were placed at his disposal, and horses for
supplying motive power, with the result that by
friction in boring the cannon so much heat was
generated that water surrounding the cannon was
brought up to boiling point. Well, Rumford made
a good thing of it; from Mr. he became Count;
he was awarded a large pension, became the
observed of all observers, and a leading scientist
of his day.
“ At the very same time an aboriginal of New
South Wales came in from the bush, threw down
a bundle of opossums to his gin, who pro-
ceeded to rub two pieces of wood together
until they burst into flame, and then cooked
her lord's dinner, which he squatted down and
ate, throwing to her scraps of it over his shoulder.
You see, the Australian black knew that heat was
an outcome of motion, and he and his ancestors
had practised it for generations, but ho got no
countship, no pensi n, no kudos for putting the
natural law in act'on —lie only got his dinner.
“So with Stanley and his discoveries. He is
only taking credit for what was discovered long
before he came into existence, and England is
taking advantage of his second-hand discoveries.
Proof of this may be seen in the Auckland Public
Library.” _ ,
Proceeding accordingly to the Library, Sir
George took down a small octavo volume in very
old calf and said ; “Here is a little book that 1
picked up as a bargain, for its value then was not
known. There are only three copies extant with
the two maps included, this is one of them, and
yet 1 got it for £35.
“Its very title will show you the wonderful
nature of its contents as illustrating the value of
modern African discovery.”
The following is the full title of the book m
question:—
A RKI’ORT OK THE KIKODOME OF CONGO, A REGION OF
Africa.—And of the Countries that border rounde
ABOUT THE SAME.
1. Wherein is also shewed that the two zones 2 ornda
and Frigida are not only habitable, but inhabited, and
very temperate, contrary to the opinions of the old
philosophers.
■2. That the blaoke colour which is in the skinnes of the

tains of the Moone, as hath heene heretofore beleeuved :

Iteastes that arc found in those countries.

London, 1588.
Turning then to the maps, Sir George pointed
out that the mountains of the moon were properly
placed- the Congo traced to its sources. The
lakes now known as Victoria, Nyauza, Albert
Nyanza, and Albert Edward Nyanza, all duly
located, with the Nile issuing from its due
sources; Tanganyika recorded ; and Stanley’s
so-called great discovery, the bend in the Congo,
correctly set down ; while the whole Shire district
was also mapped out.
“ And now,” said Sir George, “ we will turn to
other proofs afforded by a greater discoverer and
better man than Stanley.” He accordingly pro-
duced a file of twelve original letters from
Livingstone, written to him as Governor of the
Cape during the progress of the great traveller
through Central Africa. In one of these (none of
them have ever yet lieen published, though all
are open to inflection in the Auckland Library),
Livingstone speaks of his astonishment, while pro
ceeding through theUpperShini district,on finding
himself among tribes who professed Christianity,
and who, in their invocations to the Deity, used
forms of prayer but little altered from the words
which they had learned from their.TesuitPortuguese
instructors far more than 100 years ago. These sire
as nearly as possible Livingstone’s own words,
repeated from memory, in the absence of the
original. Livingstone gives some 20 prayers, &e.,
as taken down by him from dictation, including
the Pater, Credo. Ave. Maria, Litanies, Confiteor,
and many others.
The subject might be pursued further, but

POTITICAL POINTS
West Australia’s public debt is £1,284,079,
or about £23 per head of population.
The insurrection in Portugal has failed.
Yet the Republic is not dead, but only sleepeth—
as in Spain.
Post-prandial Parkes has declared that
Treasurer MAlillan is “a strong-minded man.”
Does he mean postprandial MAlillan, or the
morning edition thereof?
“ Boys Wanted ’ Such is the familiar
legend outside the. labour-office door. What for?
Why, to take men’s places, and grow up into
cheap—because uneducated —labour.
Sir 'Envy says that his “ dear friend, Mr,
Brunker, has homespun abilities.” It is sooth-
ing to know that Brunker partially reciprocates
this cordiality, and frequently alludes to Parkes
as his “ very dear friend.”
Alexander Oliver, Registrar of Friendly
Societies and Parliamentary draughtsman of
N.S. Wales, emphatically told the Labour Com-
mission that every new trades-union that is formed
is an improvement of existing conditions.
Arabi, the Egyptian, has made a piteous
appeal for mercy, to the relentless Salisbury
( twas Gladstone who banished him eight years
ago.) There is no nation like England for putting
down the English spirit. Anybody but an
Anglican can be patriotic.
The Spanish General Election has resulted
conservatively. The Conservatives followed
Disraeli’s methods in Spain, and gave the masses
votes, knowing that they would sway for the
Monarchy and the Roman Camarilla. This will last
only for a time, till Education trickles and distils.
“TheN.Z. Government is almost wholly
composed of self-made men,” Then the labor-
party has little to hope from it. The Boimderby
of Australasia is generally a man of callous heart
and adamantine conscience. The self-making of
one usually necessitates the undoing of ten thou-
sand.
Parkes says that “sometimes monkeys”
have climbed to the top of the poll. Hearken to a
parable:—
“Free labourers!” Rounded up like
sheep by police hirelings, in what are they free?
Bowing down to the irresponsible tyranny of
banded capital, for permission to live, where is
their liberty ? Stealing the life rights of their
manlier brethren, and, for the offal bones cast to
them, embracing wage-slavery, it is the very
needle’s point of satire to dub them “free
labourers. ”
Says the Orange Leader :
E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., writes to Sydnev D.T. in a
vacuous anti-socialistic vein. He says we want
‘The right to rear an independent shed
And give the lips we love unborrowed bread.’
To which we reply:—
Premier Parkes declares that the only
existing political question that need be fought out
as a party one is the coming struggle of Protection
r. Freetrade. The country should paste this in
its hat, and watch the Old Man’s future
manoeuvres with the One Man One Vote question,
labour legislation, and other cognate reforms that
have hitherto only had a bogus place in the plat-
form of the party gerrymandered by this cunning
old posturer.
Sir Henry Parkes says it is not inconsis-
tent with democratic principles to raise statues to
our public men. That may be so, but it is not con-
sistent with purely democratic ideas that a statue
to such a democrat as John Dunmore Lang should
be inaugurated by an English Earl, a G.C.M.G.,
a K.C.M.G., and the wealthiest house-and-land-
owner in Sydney. Unless Mr. George Thornton
or Mr. G. R. Dibbs can ho called democrats The
Bulletin fails to see where democracy was repre-
sented at the inauguration.
Several of the Sydney dailies are pleased
to attribute the failure of the recent meeting of
the N.S.W. railway employes, re the dismissal of
Mr. Hoyle, to the satisfaction felt in the service
at the event in question. No more disgusting
falsehood was ever penned. The N.S.W. em-
ployes are not satisfied, but they are too cowed
by the high-handed action of the Railway Com-
missioners and the non-interference of the Go-
vernment to take steps until the general election,
when the ballot will speak with a voice of thunder.
Aha! The Scotch courts have strangled
the trades-unions—have clapped an embargo on
£20,000 strike funds of the railway servants,
because of directors’ actions for breach of agree-
ment. Why wasn’t this tried in Australia?—
Now, why ? We should like to have seen it
tried—just gently, to see how wo could stand it.
But it will yet be tried. The Employers’ Union
will lay a hand like a whale’s ear on all the
strike funds, but the associated workers won't bo
able to lay hands on the funds of tiio Employers’
Union.
Again about Parnell and his—oh, fie! White
lily-flowered Australia, with its Parkeses, Services
and Berrys, is the only exception to the rule tln>^
°... . x • p
tatesmeu require their Egenas a la Numa, ot
Rome—who used to go to a grotto, and talk to
Egeria through a barbed wire rabbit-proof fence,
about nothing but politics. Talleyrand, Met-
ternich, Palmerston, and all those fellows, had
their Egerias, so had Oavour. Then there were
Lord Melbourne and Mrs. Norton. Gortschakoff,
octogenarian, took his fair Circassian to the Berlin
Conference.
Three or four years ago, the standing
toast all over North Queensland, and especially
in the sugar-growing districts along the coast,
was a solemn “Now then, boys, D.5.G.,” the
lepers thus hissed out being interpreted to mean,
“ Damn Sam Griffith !” During Griffith’s recent
N.Q. tour, on the Separation sniff, lie availed
himself of many opportunities of reminding Ins
quondam exeerators of their former favourite
toast, and politely’ asked them if they were any
better off for having so frequently and freely
cursed him in the past.
The U.S. Government is going to lay the
telegraph to connect San Francisco with Hawaii,
Samoa, and Japan, and, of course, that will
involve flic cable to New Zealand, jo ning ’Frisco
to us, the greatest day in Australian Jvistory.
Good healthy’ news will come through every day-
news not distorted through an English bine glass
or yellow jaundice, or green spectacle medium
fresh milk from the cow, and no desiccated Im-
perial milk-powder. Our present cablegrams are
insidious and slimy and smell like the inside of
the Crown after a coronation.
Surprise is excited at the cabled news of
the Italian Premier, Crispi, handing in Ir’s resig-
nation, when he had a majority of four-fifths of
the Legislature at the general election of Nov.
last. He is always shaky, because shady, this
whilom ferocious Radical Garibaldi’s henchman,
now turned into a prancing Conservative, nego-
tiator of alliances with the hateful Austrian, and
plotter against Republican France. He has so
enwreathed himself with the Monarchy, so waxed
A BURST OF AUSTRALIAN LOYALTY.
GOVERNOR HOPETOUN (recored of Cr[?] by an enthusiastic deputation
consisting of the principal boy of the district) : “Thank yon kind friends, 1
will telegraph this glad event to Her Majesty.”
Umberto’s moustache, that he will be left when
the Republic comes.—But the moustache “ may
last his time.”
Labor organises in Victoria. The Trades
Hall is preparing a gigantic octopean ramification
for next general election, and will swamp Parlia-
ment with Labor candidates. If Graham Berry
had to begin over again, he would get a magni-
ficent show —the berries will grow on every bush.
Tin; other day Berry, now Sir Graham, wrote out
from London asking whether if ho returned to
Victoria he could get the leadership of the
Liberals. “ No,” replied his friend, “ your name
is now never mentioned here.” False ! We heard
it mentioned last week —coupled with that of
Judas Iscariot.
Just think again over Robespierre's
vitality—his name keeps shooting over the ocean
a century after that horrible day when Sanson
thrust him under the guillotine, in Thcrmidor.
The explanation is in Mirabcau’s remark “That
young man will go far. He believes what he
says.” There were fifty men of more ability than
Robespierre in the French Re\olution, but they
lacked faith. Men like Bright and Glad tone
think they can go a certain length and then pull
the people up, l>y their own overwhelming person-
ality. Vain ! Miraboau thought so, but Marie
Antoinette bought him.
The Bulletin is informed that JOOO copies
of the Christmas number of a. certain Sydney
paper were purchased with N.S.W. Treasury
money (about €120) for the purpose of being sent
to Ehgland for free distribution “as an advertise-
ment for Sydney,” and that though the price paid
was thus about od. per copy, the very same paper
was sold to the. news-agents at Ijd. per copy.
Now, who authorised this little job, so reminis-
cent of the recent notorious Bailey lecturing
grant? And who will dare to aver that, news-
paper-proprietors subsidised by the State (without
the State’s knowledge) in such a stylo can run
their journals in a politically-honest wav?
“ Dog don’t eat dog ?” Oh, yes, he does ;
A flunkey often “rounds on ” flunkeys ;
While labour bees, the drones but buzz;
Baboons are found reviling monkeys.
We do not care for living in a shed ;
Want something else to eat besides the bread.
This shed and bread affair is nearly dead,
We want some ease and comfort now instead.

Rolf Boldre wood’s “Captain Starlight

Parson Marson, the Adelaide barmaids
friend, has jumped into prominence agaixi—by
calmly stating that all Nonconformist ministers

as Marson anticipated, is a shindy equal to the
Kilkenny election.
The Shah of Persia, being troubled by

Premier Griffith, of Queensland, while in
Melbourne, was the guest of Premier Munro.
Griffith, the hard-headed, is credited with a
potentiality, under dire pressure, of a-bottle-of-
whisky-a-day. Munro is a never-touch-it-nor-
keep-it-for-my-friends. How did they compro-
mise ?
Gill, a strapping Irishman, is the coming,
or rather arrived, London barrister. In the recent
case of Marks v. Butterfield, he quite lorded it
over Sir Charles Russell, for a whole week, and
Geo. Lewis, theatrical attorney, was so delighted
that he made Gill free of his house. Lewis has
a raw on Russell.
A man named Steers, on the Queensland
border, went to a finance firm six months ago and
obtained a loan, giving as security a mortgage on
five white steers. It did not strike the financier
that anything was wrong until, the other day, he
levied on the security. Then he found that the
steers were the sons of the old man.
When G overnor Jersey was a wild college
youth he was “ accommodated ” by the Hebrews
to an alarming extent. On coming of age and
.succeeding to the big pile which an accident of
birth had filched for him, he was advised to take
no notice of the “debts of his minority.” But
Jersey was not built that way. He paid all, with
5 per cent, added.
Newberry, the Adelaide defaulting official
(formerly a gubernatorial attache), is supposed to
have struck for California—which it is the local
fashion to do. Woods and Dnnsterville, both
formerly of the S.A. Civil service, will probably
welcome the latest arrival. In each case the
absconder could have been easily caught had
certain influential persons wished.
Fire-low-and-lay-’em-out Col. Tom Price
refuses to accept the olive-branch from Dr.
Maloney, M.P., ere the little Doctor goes to
Europe. Tom don’t mind so much for himself,
but there is his depaited and maligned parient,
one of the gentlest creatures that ever breathed :
so ho indites a flaming letter to the papers, after
firing off his horse-pistol, and sniffing the smoke—

-Lieutenant-Colonel G. R. Browne, last
week sentenced in Sydney to three months’ gaol
for false pretences (he had bought clothes with a
valueless cheque for £J, out of which he received
£ll2s. (id. change), has been convicted perhaps a
dozen times, and is on the subject of worthless
cheques an absolute lunatic. He is a distinguished
army-officer, having been present at Alma, Inker-
man, and at the assault on the Malakoff, where
he lost an arm. Afterwards he served in India,
and was present at the Relief of Lucknow. Issuing
bad cheques appears to be his only vice.
While Sir John Robertson was on an
electioneering tour, some 20 years ago, he encoun-
tered a young mother, who held up her offspring
to be kissed by the candidate, after the fashion of
the Hon. S. Slumkey. Sir John did his duty
without any outward or visible sign of repug-
nance ; and the father, interposing, informed him
that the baby was named Algernon. “ Alger-
non !” demanded tho knight; “do you want to
damn the child for ever? Call him Tom, Dick,
or Harry, and make an honest man of him ; call
him Algernon and you’ll make him into a billiard-
marker !”

A certain great statesman took unto him-
self a second wife, who was as young as the
daughters he had begotten by his first. The
second Mrs. Statesman, immediately on her
enthronement, impressively informed her new
daughters-in-law that she was “going to be mis-
tress in this establishment.” Whereupon, one of
the girls sweetly remarked; “It will come easy
t) you to b* mistress inside the house; you've
been long enough a mistress outside of it.”

The charming widow whom the clergyman
of a certain fashionable Sydney church refused to
hitch the other day because the ceremony had
already been performed, was formerly engaged
to a naval officer. The story goes that so far had
matters advanced that their trousseau was actually
ordered from England, and, with a sentiment
which was charming in its simplicity and subtle in
its origin, the lady arranged to have the various
articles of dress packed jointly; his walking coats
with her walking dresses, his hats with her
bonnets, etc. But, alas ! by the time the ship came
to hand whispering tongues had poisoned truth,
the match was off, and the fair romanticist was re-
luctantly compelled to sort out the gallant captain’s
pyjamas for her robes dennit, and—well, and soon.
» # *
This reminds one in a roundabout
way that a certain other service mag-
nate was aforetime engaged to a wealthy
Australian lady. Sending her one day a
note full of delicious love bon-bons, deli-
cacies calculated to make a grandmother’s heart
flutter, while getting his English letters ready, he
snnehow inserted as ip intended for foreign con-
sumption only. It contained one reference to his
fin meet that though complimentary, was yet out-
spoken enough to break the match off: “I am
delighted to be able to assure you that I love
more, and her money less, daily.”

Valentines are nearly dead. Christmas
cards have killed them, and they go the way of
the pantomimes. The postman is delighted on
the whole. His load of bleeding hearts was more
than the butcher’s. But then he misses all the
girls’ sweet smiles, which he took unto himself.
One who was once well-known as a rising
man of business in Sydney, but who is now an
inmate of Liverpool Benevolent Asylum, attributes
his dismal failure in life to the corrupting in-
fluences of Old Jack Robertson. Thus : The pre-
sent recipient of charity was an ironmonger’s
assistant, when Old Jack was Premier. One
Saturday morning Jack entered the ironmonger’s
shop and ordered some wire netting, with—
“ Mind you, now, send the (blank) stuff down to-
day without fail, because I (crimson) well want to
(clotty) well build a(rufous) hen-house to-morrow.”
“ Oh, but,” timidly ventured the ironmonger’s
assistant, who had been piously reared but whose
reverence for goodness was struggling with his
fear of offending the most popular and powerful
man in N.S.W., “oh, but to-morrow is Sunday,
Sir John.” “Sunday or no (cherry) Sunday,”
gruffly replied Old Jack, “I mean to build that
(incarnadine) hen-house to-morrow.” It was the
first insidious crack in the young man’s conception
of the Fourth Commandment; he insensibly fell
away from grace ; the cleavage in his ideas of the
church catechism became wider ; he morally pined
away and is now spiritually dead, while his lines
are cast in the rough ruts of cold charity officially
dispensed. Doth Old Jack still Pharaoh his
heart ?

The baronet who was discovered cheating
Tummy and other distinguished persons at
cards, and who has (says the cable) fled to
the Continent, will, writes a correspondent,
probably turn out to be the man often re-
ferred to in The Bulletin as having taken lessons
from a skilled sharper in the parlour of a flash
pub. The Bulletin baronet is “a well known
figure in London society,” and his name begins
with J. His confederate is, or was, a nobleman
of higher rank, who is still alive and friendly with
the Prince of Wales. These two men always
came together to take their lessons in shuffling,
marking, dealing, and so forth, from the expert.
They made a half-and-half attempt to disguise
themselves for these visits to the pub., and their
exact identities remained a mystery until the
master one day spotted his two pupils in the Royal
Enclosure at Ascot, when a toney member of the
talent told him their names. If J, has fled to the
Continent, The Bulletin will improve the
occasion still further, and try to put a little one
in for the other fellow. The accused baronet’s
name, as per cable, turns out to be Gordon-
Cumming, a scion of a family of hitherto irre-
proachable reputation.

One thing that Governor Jersey can’t do
is to shake hands impressively. Cariugton was a
failure in some respects, but at least he grabbed
everybody he met as cordially as if the person
was a new found uncle, while his successor merely

LORD JERSEY: “Ah! to what am I indebted for the honor of this visit?”

BAND : “God save the Queen.”
deposits in your hand something that seems like
a dead fish split in five sections, and leaves you to
embrace the cold, dejected flounder for a second
and then let it drop. And when you abandon
the object it falls like a frog falling on a throne,
and drops with a thud among Jersey’s legs, where
it dangles after the manner of a hanged outcast
on a gallows.

What to do with the rubbish of Sydney is
now a leading question. Many of the aldermen
say tow it out to sea. They now tow out to sea
the refuse from the slaughter-houses, and thus it
happens that, at intervals, the beach at Manly is
covered with putrescent entrails for hundreds of
yards, and that when you go in to bathe a pair of
bullock’s lungs suddenly arises on a breaker and
slaps you in the face.

Sydney Daily Telegraph, which chaffs
British editors on their lamentable ignorance of
Australian geography, placidly, refers to the
“John Darien” (!) station in connection with
shearing troubles. Now, it was at Jondaryan
station that Duke Alfred, of Edinburgh, was pic-
nicked on his first visit to the Darling
Downs. Arthur Hodgson (afterwards degraded
into Sir Arthur Hodgson) had a “damper”
made—a monster the size of a cartwheel—but
Alfred could neither be coaxed nor coerced into
tasting this specimen of bushman’s fare, and
giggled out, “I hope you’ll take this as eaten.”
Which was sufficient toestablishhis reputation as a
wit, the flunkeys around him declaring that it
wasthebestthingthey overheard. Nevertheless, the
D.T. has forgotten Jondaryan, the birthplace of the
wittiest thing ever said in Australia. Again, it
was but last year that Jondaryan was before all
Australia as the station at which began the suc-
cessful attempt of shearers to humble the Darling
Downs squatters.

The fact that the N.S.W. Government
account has been withdrawn from the City Bank,
reminds us of the fact that Mr. “Will. Neill,"
Premier Parkes’ banker, no longer manages that
institution.
Alison’s Cauonbar and Maryvale Stations,
beyond Nyngan, N.S.W., were sold a few days
ago to Mr. James Ranker, of Wyong, for
£192,721. They comprise 1,100,000 acres 1
# # •
The mention of these big figures recalls,
in some esoteric way, a story once related to us by
a wealthy squatter, and which is tellingly
illustrative of tiie startling ups and downs by no
means uncommon in pastoral life. “ Many years
ago,” said the old pioneer, “ 1 was sheep-super-
intendent on one of the biggest Riverine pro-
perties. There fell upon the country a terrible
drought, which endured for so long that pastoral
losses ran into millions of pounds. Our nearest
neighbours were the ’s, who had been many
years engaged in squatting, and had invested in
their Riverine station about £lOO,OOO, most of it
their own money. This long and terrible drought
ruined them. They found themselves hopelessly
indebted to the bank, and the bank came down
upon them —it had to. When the end came, the
miseries of the drought had utterly demoralised
the ’s. They left what had for many years
been their home, and when they arrived wearily at
the out-station at which I had my head-quarters,
they were literally without boots to their feet.
Mrs. , a highly - educated and tenderly-
nurtured lady, was in a pitiable plight, though
she bore up bravely. Her toes were sticking out
out of holes in her boots. The children were,
absolutely barefooted. The whole party were
moneyless and actually hungry. I vacated my
hut for the benefit of the mother and bairns, and
slept under a gumtree. They continued their
journey only to encounter fresh troubles. They
were suddenly bailed up by flood-waters, and
marooned for 48 hours on an island, without food
and with the odds in favour of their being
drowned. Now, had they been allowed to retain
possession of their station, the very floods
that threatened to engulf them would have made
their fortune, for the A ’s, who bought the
station, cleared £200,000 out of it in a very little
while. It never seemed to occur to the A ’s,
however, to send a cheque to their unfortunate
predecessors. Mrs. afterwards had to take
in washing in order to earn a living. Some friends
to whom she applied for laundry-work, tried to
persuade her to give up rough work for teaching,
but Mrs. grimly replied : “It is far better
for a lady to be a washerwoman than a governess! ”

We are informed in the scientific column
of a Brisbane paper that the reflected heat of the
moon is just equal to that of a lighted candle at a

The fab English flunkey is beginning to
make himself apparent in Australia. He may bo
found now on any summer afternoon loafing beside
his owner’s carriage in George-street, Sydney,
with his degraded head disguised in powder or
flour, and a miserable coloured coat and top-boots
piled on top of his carcase as a public announce-
ment that he is kept to do, for another man, any
kind of household job which is so mean that the
other man won't do it himself. He is generally
young and sturdy, and about as good-looking as
an alleged human being can be who is always
grovelling to hisjat proprietor, and he has a ser-
vile eye and a well-drilled smile, and an all-over
look of satisfied abasement. He seems to enjoy
his billet as a male housemaid and a he-girl-of-all-
woi’k, and he touches his hat with his forefinger
and bows and uses the term “ sir ” more than any
other party on the face of the earth. Whether
this alleged animal is born in Australia we cannot
say, but we don’t think he is, and we trust in
Providence that he is not, and if we are wrong on
this point, then we can only wish that we had
been more careful in the selection of a birthplace,
for to be born in the same continent with a flun-
key is too much. Yet if we know the Australian
aright, he is not the kind of individual to white-
wash his head and make an Aunt Sally of himself
for the public amusement, and if he ever learns
this art we devoutly hope that some reliable
foreign tyrant may come along and pump the
paint off his dishonored cranium, and confiscate
the elephant’s-breath coat and the giraffe-sneeze
boots, and then kick him right out into the wil
derness and leave him there to pursue some hones
oalling by means of a bush harrow and an axe.

Deal- Bulletin, —T have read your edify-
ing anecdotes concerning the unoleaniiness of
Chinese cooks, and now tor a word apropos. The
Chinaman is not the only person who chews bread
and spits it out again for the purpose of making
dainty dishes. On board English sliips the sailors
generally have a dish known as “ dog’s-body,”
and this is how it is manufactured ; The pea-soup
comes to the forecastle in a small wooden tub
called a “kid.” Then each sailor takes his share
in a tin-plate, and, getting a biscuit, commences
chewing it and dropping it into the soup, which,
when it becomes thick enough, lie cats. - Kamhlkh,

culinary methods of Chinese cooks. \Vc hare
one of those individuals here—and for stoning
raisins, I will back him against any living man
not born in China. His plan is to take a great
mouthful of “plums” (just as a man fills his
mouth with tacks when putting up lining on a
wall) and get rid of the stoned fruit as quickly
as his hands can take it out of his teeth. He is a
very clean Chinaman, for he is always careful to
drop the raisins into a dish of fresh water and
blow the stones out into his apron (he invariably
sits down when engaged in this class of work.) I
may add that lie is my boss’s cook and that I don’t
board there. Yours truly, Alphabet.

In Yurrup and America it is the fashion
this season for women to be tall and stately,
whereas last season it was the fashion to be small
and fairy-like, in consequence of which variations
there is much agony in the best society. For the
woman who was short last year can’t be made any
longer this year, unless she is dislocated on a rack
or hung up by the hair with a dining-table or a
brass bedstead suspended to her feet to drag her
out, and nobody knows what to do. The gladsome
angel who brightens man’s pathway and strands
him with her millinery bill is not built like a
telescope to draw m and out with three slides,
neither can she go up and down like a thermo-
meter. The only thing she can do is to wear
springs on her boots and expand her hat, and if
she is so small that even these devices have no
effect, she lies low and waits for better fashions.

At the recent inauguration of the Lang
Statue it was a matter of general comment that
the men whom the Doctor made wealthy and their
descendants should have failed to subscribe the
£3OOO required for the memorial. It was plain,
from what one heard while walking round the
crowd that many of the old people present were
there because the Doctor had married them;
they thought after all the years that had elapsed
that they owed his memory a debt of gratitude.
Marriage isn’t always a failure.

There is a certain pleasant little residence
in a lane off Bourke-street, Melbourne, where a
policeman gets killed or else badly damaged now
and then, and consequently the average “cop”
jpves it a wide berth. There are about sixteen
inhabitants as a rule, and about sixteen of them
are drunkards, and the other sixteen are thieves
>,nd assorted malefactors. Now and then some
harmless stranger drifts into this establishment,
and then the painted harridan in charge makes
him drunk on muddy rum at 3s. 6d. a liquor, and
some fusty individual cleans him out at euchre or
else simply shakes out his pockets, and finally
someone else takes his coat and hat and kicks him
on the head and throws him out. In short, it is a
nice place generally, but anyone who passes by
when the door is open can see glaring on the wall
of the front room the legend “ God bless our
home,” and a policeman who went in recklessly to
inquire about something, and came out hurriedly
through the window, taking the sash along with
him, reports that the principal decoration inside
is an illuminated card with the inscription “ Him
that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.”
Piety is a great institution.

THE DAY WE USED TO CELEBRATE.
Valentine’s Day ! yet the postmen
Scarce note an increase in their load ;
We always sent one (same as most men)
To some “ pass ng fancy’s ’’ abode.
Ah ! what has become of the Circes
Who simpered, or tossed up the head
At the sight of our tokens and verses ?
They are married, or dead.
Is the world any wiser or better
Because at old customs it mocks—■
At the gloves sent with never a letter,
Or the trinket enclosed in a box?
For Maud’s little “ fives and three-quartbrs ”
We deemed it a pleasure to pay—
But our sons send no gloves to her daughters
On Valentine’s Day.
Such follies have dropped out of fashion
(Tis so much the better or worse),
And prose is the language of passion
Which Strephon once put into verse.
Is the sentiment nowadays deeper ?
Does the tide of true love never ebb ?
Why, the girls, we imagine, get cheaper
Each fourteenth of Feb.
Valentine’s Day ! e’en the trade is
In “ ugly ones ” languid and faint;
Our boys and their knowing young ladies
Care nothing at all for the Saint;
Though he played a great part in the mashes
Of men who are bald on the head.
And those darlings, in muslins and sashes,
Who are married, or dead.

Now’ve lost their fascination ?

And sour and grim as well as “ragged?”

Ex-cricketer Lord Harris, the Governor of
Bombay, has ordered that civilians attending his

their dress-coats. This comes of sending an

Melbourne papers report the glad news
that matters are beginning to go better in the
hospital down there. There was trouble for a long
time between the male and female students, and
in the dissecting-room especially the latter used to
burst in and grab things in a way that aggravated
the unconsidered male animal intensely. They
invariably rushed the cancers and the malignant
tumours before any other fellow had a show, and
by shoving violently to the front they used to
secure the inside of the “ subject,” and leave the
lie-student to gaze with a disgusted eye at one leg
and an ear—they cleaned out all the rest. Then
it was objected that the female operators neglected
the small courtesies of the profession—that when
they had finished inspecting a stomach or some
i ither trifle they refused to pass it on to the man
who was waiting for it, and that in such small
matters as an exchange of a plate of brains, or a
fractured skull, or a spine, or a shovelful of
entrails they were lamentably deficient in ordinary
politeness. Very often a pale, spectacled youth
would ask a lady, in the most courteous manner
possible, to kindly pass him two feet and a liver,
and by way of response she would turn her back
on him with derision, but if he had the feet and
she wanted them she would state audibly that be
was no gentleman. However, as already men-
tioned, things are going better now, and though
relations are still more or less strained it is
believed the parties will pull through without
banging each other with spines and umbrellas and
things as they once threatened to do. A sort of
armed neutrality lias taken the place of open
warfare, and the two sexes pass the ribs and the
lungs to each other in freezing silence.

excellent advice, and they also looked out to see
that the sharks didn’t bite her. Likewise the

In Melbourne District Court on weekly
fraud-summons day the civil servant comes up as
regularly as clockwork. These regular incomes
for a puddle-horse job, round and round, are the
ruin of a man. The system fosters the craven
spirit of always waiting for dead men’s shoes. As
promotion depends almost entirely on merely
keeping alive (for they don’t ap’pint Maloney and
Patsy and Tim so often in Victoria now), the ill-
ness of a superior is watched with glee—all that
delight which Hawthorne’s Chillingworth, in the
“Scarlet Letter,” displays over the slow wearing
away of his enemy. This fiendish spirit pervades
the whole Service, and when you ask a superior
officer about his health he glares as George
Grossmith used to on his understudy, Frank
Thornton.

offer, subject only to the approval of her parents,
who, being more versed in the snares and pitfalls
of this world, prosecuted private enquiries and
discovered that the advertiser was a brothel-
keeper in a Western town and a well-known fraud
in the matter of decoy advertisements in the

Mr. Fred. Gibson, barrister-at-law, has
been appointed an acting judge of N.S.W. Dis-
trict Court. It is just aliout time for the District-
Court to be put on a decent footing by the appoint-
ment of young judges, and the institution of a
proper retiring system (based on pension or other-
wise) for judges. Most of the judges who- have
served of late years were appointed when past
middle age, and as they are not allowed to retire
after fifteen years’ service, like the Supreme Court
judges, they slave on for twenty years in order to
be able to claim pension. There can be no valid
reason urged against the appointment to such
posts of young and energetic men. Mr. Back-
house, appointed when he was three-and-thirty,
is perhaps the most popular judge who has yet
sat on the District Court bench as, indeed, he is
one of the most efficient. Judge Murray, too, is
a pronounced success.

A lady who has set up in London as a
fashionable beautifier says that when a new
female client comes along the first thing she does
is to get her face clean, and, as a rule, it takes a
week of persistent labour to do it. There is an
old, forgotten im mstation of paint and powder
and enamel that is as hard and tough as the shiny
exteriorof an ancient rooster’s legs, and for yearsthe
patient has been washing the mere outside of this
alluvial deposit under a mistaken impression that
she was washing her own skin. As to what kind
of a woman will be found underneath that is all a
toss-up ; the outside may be a faded harridan of
50, and the inner surface a person of 30; or, on
the other hand, she may start to wash a com-
paratively young lady and unearth a Methusaleh
who seems to have been leftover from the Deluge.
But, anyhow, she always washes her clients and
keeps them washed, and her whole after-treatment
consists in giving them bottled wiiter in order to
prevent them using other cosmetics. They pay
immense prices for this process, too, and yet if
they only met together and pumped on each other
the result would be just the same.

enchanting old fraud is a perpetual snare to the
deadbeats, who, once and once only, plumb the
well of his sympathy. A “bummer” approaches
him with a cunningly-woven yarn of woe, and
ends by .begging to be saved from starvation.
“Do you drink ? ” enquires the bland Casby. If
the mendicant says “ No, sir,” the philanthropist
smilingly replies—“ Then you don’t require me to
give you threepence for a long beer,” and marches
off serenely. If, on the other hand, the beggar
confesses to taking an occasional “snifter,” the
eyes of Casby turn grave and his voice is heard
solemnly declaring—“ My poor fellow, I have
made it a strict rule of my life never to assist
anybody who drinks.” And so he passes on, un-
scathed by the guerilla onslaughts of the cadgers.

who prepares the plans and specifications of his
own hats, has just given his brother professionals
a nice “turn.” He told the N.S.W. Public
Works Committee that about 44 architects out of
50 would submit plans which they knew could
not be erected for the amounts specified.
BURIED.
But the scandal out of sight—
Let it be forgotten.
Blackest jobs look better white :
What seems wrong is ever right,
Nothing’s bad or rotten.
“ Prosecution great mistake ”
Big-wigs tried to stop it;
In their slices we saw them shake ;
Hot affair, for credit’s sake
Drop it, Shiels, pray drop it !
Lot the scandal buried lie,
So to dust it dwindles ;
Fellows curse and women sigh,
Bigwigs merely wink the eye ;
If the Law say nothing, why,
Who shall whisper “ swindles

The present Salvation Army dissensions
may expose General Booth’s method of dealing I
with the funds of the Army. However, no dis-
closure will much surprise people, for in Booth’s
struggle with the brewers over the lease of the
Eagle Tavern, London, the presiding judge
declared his (General Booth’s) sworn affidavit to
be “disingenuous, misleading, and framed to
deceive the Court.” The decision in the case
meant a loss of £20,000 to the Army.
All work has been stopped at Cardiff by a
strike. This is at the Bute docks, “owned” by
Lord Bute, and which cost him two millions of
pounds. Cardiff now does more export trade
than either London or Liverpool, and, in exports,
stands second to New York amid all ttie cities of
the globe, the Cardiff output of coal alone being
over ten millions of tons annually. Yet all this
business revolves around an idle lord, and its sole
aim is to keep him in luxury. A knowledge of
this will feed the flames of the toilers’ enthusiasm
in the coming desperate struggle, when Australia
must again help the dockers.
Miss Susan Minerva Train, only daughter
and eldest child of our old friend George Francis |
Train, was married recently to Philip Dunbar |
Gulager, chief clerk of the gold department of the |
sub-treasury in New York. Susie is no chicken j
now. She was to have been a boy, and then, as a ■
man, President of the United States, for when
the interesting event was expected did not George
pack off Mrs. G.F.T. from Melbourne to Yankee-
land so as to have the expected heir duly qualified
for presidential honours? the “schemes of
men and mice gang aft agley,” and when little j
Susie made her appearance George came in for a
full measure of chaff. However, who knows that
a descendant of G. F. Train may not after all
come to reside at the White House ?
The Czar has a newspaper of his own and
reads it himself—in fact, he is the only individual
who ever does read it. The censor gets all the
Russian newspapers and a good many from other
parts of Europe, and clips out all the articles
which are filled with reverent gush concerning his
huge, ignorant monarch; and then this combined
information is set up as a separate paper and His
Majesty gets his knowledge out of it. Nothing
that can possibly offend the Czar is ever inserted,
and as most things that happen are calculated to
offend the Czar, there are very few facts that he
ever hears about. But, on the other hand, he
hears about a great many facts that never hap-
pened at all, so matters are about even.

“Augur” Chapman, sporting editor of the
Australasian, is, we regret to hear, seriously ill. Mr.
Chapman is one of the few Australian sporting writers
who understands "his subjects, writes good English, has
tho. confidence of all classes, and brings to bear upon
horse-topics the experience of a cultivated man of the
world.

Handicapper Barnard, Melbourne, retires after
this season, having rendered 21 years honorable service.
This Australian Rous has run the gauntlet of metaphorical
whip-cuts from all the owners, beginning with Tait, De
Mestre, Hurtle Fisher, Winch, Lang, and Waldock, down
to White, Wallace, and our generation, hut comes out
well—w'e only recall one big mistake, which was when ho
let Lee’s Barbelle in so light at Flemington as to make
her a gift of two races in one day. “The General who
never made mistakes never made war,” said Wellington.
* # *
It is proposed to put the succession to Handi-
capner Barnard, Melbourne, in commission, with a com-
mittee of three, but we venture to say the outcries
would be far greater than over the committee of one,
and, besides, there is an immensely greater probability of
improper influence creeping in. Barnard was appointed
after all these things had been tried, and after a great
row about the judge being discovered to have dabbled in
a bet. One would like Augur Chapman to have had a
try at weighting, but this universally honoured turfite is
not so robust as he was.

By the same mail a Chinese seas-skipper re-

The majority of Sydney’s sporting writers and

Jacques Ibbott, the athlete who was ass enough
to ruin his constitution, two or three months ago, by
going without food for forty days, met Pahlo Fanque, the
burly dark-skinned blacksmith, at the Australian Ath-
letic Club, Sydney, the other evening for a small purse in
agoto a finish. Ibbott weighed only lOst. (he used to
weigh twelve), and was giving two stone away. Game as
a pebble, but weak as a cat, the fruit-eater went calmly to
sleep in the second round, and steak was once more
triumphant.

Wirth’s, Carver’s, and other riding shows are
challenging Australian boundary-riders to sit buck-

get on a “ pig-jumper ” even for a year’s pay.

The sculling match between Messrs. G. Ruwald
and G. C. Bastes on the Parramatta, from Uhr’s Point
to the Brothers, for a £lO trophy, was won by the former,
somewhat easily, by three lengths. Time for about three
miles, probably somewhat less, 22min. 361 sec.

The Sydney athletes were fairly successful at
the Maoriland amateur champion sports) In the absence
of Hempton, “Billy” M’Pherson, with the wind astern,
won the 100yds., it is said, in 9 4-sths secs, time, the
correctness whereof it is easy to doubt; the 250yds. in
24 3-10ths secs, (the world’s best record, if correct), on a
slightly-down-hill course, and the 440yds. in 50 2-sths secs.
Bailey, Sydney’s walker, was disqualified twice for
“lifting.” In the absence of Morrison, D. Wood, of
Canterbury, won the half-mile, mile and three-mile races,
the latter in lOmin. 40 2-6ths secs., an Australian record.
Barger won the hurdle races, as usual, in fast time.

There were enough stiff ’uns at Rosehill pony

The betting on the Pace Welter at Warwick
Farm was “ very, very funny.” At one time the guileless
public took 2 to 1 about Porridge, and 6 to 1 about Cobar,
but at the finish 100 to f> could have been obtained about
either, and one well known bookmaker offered to lav 100

THE PLOT OF THE PEDS.
Dear Bulletin, —For ways that are dark and
tricks that are vain, the “ ped.,” professional or amateur,
“ takes the tai l.” In a populous township of the Cabbage
Garden, a ped. by name, say, Muldoon, had hidden his
light under a bushel for some considerable time, and his
sold yearned to “ take down,” as he phrased it, someone,
particularly another “dark horse,” yclept Smith, who
had a local reputation. Smith, however, was by no means
anxious to tackle Muldoon. Hints, challenges, and even
offers of a nominal start had failed to bring him up to the
mark. He wouldn’t bite.
A brilliant idea entered Muldoon’s head, ai d in
company with a mate named M’Pherson, lie daho-
rated it till it became a real work of art. 1 On
the next pay-night (I forgot to mention that all three
worked at the same tannery), when all hands (about 40)
vno 3 1,1 ' , ' le t° wns hip and, of course, near or in the pub.,
M Pherson should take up Muldoon’s challenge, which
would be issued in a drunken mood, and run him for £6,
receiving 6yds. in 100. If possible, Smith was to be
appointed stakeholder. M’Pherson should win, and it
was calculated that this might have the effect of inspiring
•smith to run Muldoon himself. The stakes, though
posted, were only to he nominal, and each party after the
match was to draw his fiver. The challenge was duly
thrown out and accepted, and the stakes posted in Smith’s
nanus, for a match to he run on the following Sunday
morning, thus giving the men a week to get ready.
True to his instincts, Smith entertained grave doubts
as to the genuineness of the affair, for M’Pherson
was cleemed an utter novice on the cinder-path,
ana he bluntly approached Muldoon, expressing his
candiU though unflattering opinion, and proposing
another finale to the sprint to that originally intended.
» was agreed, after some discussion, that Smith and Mul-
midu Sh()ul , ( , l coalesce for the purpose of "putting”
1 herson through. Muldoon could win the match, and
if M’Pherson cared to back his chance (as, of course, Jie
would, believing it a “ oronk go ”) he should be accommo-
dated to the firm’s last shilling. There was a £2O-uote in
it, and they could afford to stand by the original agree-
ment and hand him back his stake.
When approached on the subject, M’Pherson modestly
expressed his doubts as to his ability to win, hut always
wound up by announcing his intention to have a d —d
good try. He’d talk of his schooldays (fifteen years back),
what he could do then, and scouted the idea of Muldoon
“ giving him six yards and losing him,” which opinion
was expressed,to him with great freedom and strong lan-
guage by all and sundry. lie played his part well, never
acting as if he had the matter already squared with Mul-
doon. However) the “other cliajjs” let the match severely
alone. “ Never back anything that speaks,” was chalked
up all over the place, and the warning was taken. Go-
betweens, however, succeeded in bringing the represen-
tative of the hidden firm of Smith & Muldoon on the one
hand, and M’Pherson on the other together, and the
reckless way in which the latter hacked himself gave
intense satisfaction to the two dark peds.
Well, to the race. They toed the mark on the Sunday
morning, bang went the pistol, away they went and as
they started so they finished, M’Pherson winning easily,
despite Muldoon’s best efforts.
Then there was weeping and gnashing Of teeth re-
criminations and abuse, blows and a fight when the clever
partners counted up their losings (£4O) to M’Pherson, the
supposed duffer, followed by an offer from him to run
again level for another £2O aside, which was not accepted.
M’Pherson left the mill the following week, and shortly
after won a big Sheffield handicap off 3 yds. in the
metropolis, under the name of , but you know the
man. —Cosmopolitan.

Slade, the Maori pugilist, seems to have ended
his professional career in Salt Lake City, where, it is said,
he married three sisters who were very wealthy. After
he had been wedded some time he intimated to his harem
that he wished to take a fourth wahine, but the idea was
distasteful to his three better halves, and, though a
fighting-man, he thought it wise to let the matter drop.
Who would go through life with a tinted
nose when the blood can be cooled by Marshall’s
Tonic N ervine?
R. E. Bush, the Murchison (W.A.)
squatter, who lias just been appointed to the new
Upper House of that colony, is a brother of W.
Bush, the late well-known English wicket-keeper.
Last year’s export of gold from W.A. was
nearly seven times the quantity sent away in 1888.
For the last three years the figures are;—1888,
3,493 ounces; 1889, 15,492 ounces; 1890, 22,810
ounces. Average value, £3 17s fid per ounce.
Lengthened experience in hotel accom-
modation qualifies us to recommend Hurley’s
Royal Hotel, Bathurst, as a hou-e'Sn which one
may enjoy a good time without being squeezed
dry when settling time comes. The house con-
tains 76 rooms, all fitted up and furnished with
the latest conveniences and comforts. Ventila-
tion has been made a study, and the kitchen is
situated in a detached building, thus removing
the unpleasant odours and cockroachy visita-
tions that are apt to emanate from indoor cookery.
The sample rooms are very large and roomy, and
the stables are particularly well-situated and
appointed. Altogether, the hotel will bear
favourable comparison with any house in Aus-
tralia, and that’s a large order.
Jeffrey Rivers is a bewildered negro,
resident in Sydney, and rejoicing in the possession
of a white wife, from whom he has be n living
apart. A babe arriving in port, Mrs. J. R.
sought the offices of the court to compel the
darkey to support it, but, as it was white as
alabaster with ginger hair, Jeffrey Rivers strongly
objected. There was a second male individual
mixed up in this matrimonial embroglio and he
was a Jersey blonde, with hair very much of the
same colour as that thatching the head of Mr. C.
Delohery, D.S.M., the presiding magistrate. The
beak remarked that matters seemed a bit mixed,
but the protesting mother declared that
her propensity for “ eating lemons ” ac-
counted for the darkey’s progeny being
white. The negro declared he was not
fool enough to swallow any such miracle, and
Delohery backed him up by declining to make
an order. This case reminds us of the Rockhamp-
ton white woman who gave birth to a coal-black
piccaninny with a woollen fez. Her hubby, being
a dull-witted white man ready “ to do his duty in
that state of life,” &c., was easily persuaded that
the progenitive phenomenon w; s due to the fact
that h ; s wife had recently been “ drinking too
much coffee.” Which again reminds us of areal
freak of maternity that is on unchallengeable
record. A lady residing in Newington Causeway
(London), some 40 years ago, gave birth to a
female child that was as black as indigo. She
could only explain the matter by saying that, a
few weeks before, she had received a sudden
fright from a negro, who had sprung out of a door-
way and demanded alms of her. This was con-
sidered to Vie a very ingenious lie, of course, and
her husband went frantic with jealousy and
liquor. However, the dark pigment in the skin
gradually paled, and, within six weeks the baby
was as fair as mummery. She grew up into a
beautiful girl (the family came out to Australia),
and is now the handsome wife of a well-known
Melbourne citizen.

Saw a maiden, young and blushing—
Told his love in language gushing,
Told his wives he wished to wed—

He was tried by female jury,
Called a “ savage Maori joker,”
Got much broom-end mixed with poker,
Now he is a husband staid—

CORRESPONDENCE
“New Zealand/’: The article on “Old Maids ”
is distinctly stolen ; we forget whence, but we have read
it before “T.M.” (North Shore): Thanks—“ D.

don’t hear so much about “ Marvellous” Melbourne
lately. Booms don’t last for ever..,. “ Paul E.O. ”; Many
thanks.... “Guelphian ” : Thanks “ Idle Pick”; Why
not give us all particulars ?....“ Boree ” (Grenfell):
Go to neither that is our straight advice. If
you visit Sydney we will put you on the right track...
“ Werda Yelnah ”: You don’t get to close quarters quickly
enough. Writing of an incident, it is not necessary to
trace its hero’s career from the cradle. Know nothing of
the “ Ragman ”....“ Arpicom ” : Too Johnsonian and
lengthy...,“ W.H.P.” (North Carlton); Try the Liberator
“Bullarto”: Not suitable “G.H.” (Cumherland-
street): Y r our philosophy is hackneyed, your rhythm
rugged. Try again “F.N.F.”: “Let go the tail of”
Pegasus ... “ J.M.” (Redfern): What is it all about?
“Dick Duffer ” : Couldn’t find space for all you ask ; will
write “par.” Tho’ your “fingers are more accustomed
to the axe, churn-handle and the business end of a cow
than the pen,” yet we feel sure everyone in Havelock is
dying to waltz you... “Kip Yeroon”: Y’onr verse has
merit. Will try to lick it into shape “Bio”: Again
return your MS. Started to revise it, hut find that you
so repeatedly turn away from the story to introduce
irrelevant incidents, that pruning is impossible
“ W.C.”: A creditable piece of versification, only marred,
so far as Tire Bulletin is concerned, by the fact that you
follow far too closely on the thoughts and words of
another writer. Try something else “Jackass
No. II.” : Have sent on your letter....“ E.S.A.”:
Sir Maurice O'Connell married the daughter of
Governor Bligh “ E.C.S.” : The appointment of an
absolute outsider, Mr. Patsy O’Connor (brother of the
N.S.W. Postmaster-General), to a Civil Service billet of
£l5O per annum, which would have been gladly accepted
as promotion by many good men already in the service,
was a distinct act of Ministerial patronage. In a justly-
governed Civil Service there should he no room for
patronage of any kind whatsoever “Why?”: An
intelligent constable should be not only a preventive, but
a reform agent. He has fifty times the influence of any
of these boggling, well-intentioned mission people. They
go and get married, and then the poor criminals may go
to the deuce.... “A Dreamer, 91”: The subject was
lengthily handled by The Bulletin in an article entitled
“The Communisation of Posthumous Wealth,” over two
years ago. Max Nordau outlines it in his “ Conventional
Lies of Civilisation.” “Biddy”: Your yarn about the
parson and the church-constructing kids is a hoary and
wicked old chestnut “T.J.P. ”: We never met any-
thing more aggravatingly inane than your poetry, except,
perhaps, your slobber anent that bloated person, the
Prince of Wales. .. “W.J.K.”: Thanks, may use....
“ L. S. Tweezer ” : As you remark, Adam and Eve had no
knowledge of music. They also had no acquaintance with
the wheezes of circus .clowns and nigger minstrels, and
bores of that character... “R.M.”: Lacks finish...
“Charley Flax”: Can sympathise with you; have also
been there .. “ W. 0.5.”: What Premier Macdonald
means by characterising the policy of the Canadian
Opposition—full trade reciprocity with the United States
—as “ veiled treason” is this: that whereas freetrade
between Canada and the States would tend to make them
into one people, the retention at the same time of the
Canadian tariff against England would tend to separa-
tion. In this matter Premier Macdonald is simply fighting
against Nature and the inevitable. [Many replies held
over.]
What a row there will be when those
(apart from the promoters &e., who probably
know all about it) interested in certain huge Sydney
land-schemes become aware that Richardson and
Wrench’s valuations of the properties which are
supposed to represent the money invested, show
the said properties to be worth only a third of the
Sums alleged—and when the balance sheets of the
said companies, with countless thousands of
liabilities on the credit side, come under the
microscope!
Last Saturday about thirty gentlemen
drove from the Land Company of Australasia’s
Bridge-street offices, in two four-horse drags to the
Gore Hill Brickworks. The party was accom-
panied thence by Mr. Wm. Harris, managing
director, and Mr. W. C. Costello, assistant
manager, and on arrival at Gore Hill were shown
over the works by Manager A. H. Codings, who
explained the different processes by which the
shale is reduced to the consistency of snuff ere
being damped, and put under ' the terrible
pressure which forms the brick and pre-
cedes its introduction to the kilns. The best
bricks, it seems, are, however, hand-pressed, and
when wanted for facing purposes, burned in the
ordinary furnaces which consume three times the
fuel necessary to bake an equal number of bricks
in the Hoffman kiln. The latter, said to be the
largest kiln in all Australasia, covers an area of
ground 280 ft. long by 80ft. in breadth, containing
10 chambers, and capable of turning out 25,000
bricks per day. Here it may be said that’the
works turn out, as a rule, 300,000 bricks per
week and that they supplied the material
for the Woy Woy tunnel and the Australia Hotel.
The Hoffman kiln was first lighted nearly three
years ago and. kept constantly burning until
ober last, when, the company haying a big
stock of coal on hand, it became more profitable
to sell Ilian to burn it. Now coal is reduced in
price, ana a., die employees—nearly 200 in num-
ber —have returned to work. Inspection over,
the party proceeded to the upper story
of the great kiln, whence a magnificent
panorama was visible outside and a gorgeous
champagne turkey luncheon, within. The various
toasts were drunk with great “enboozeiasm,” and
the individual who, in proposing “the ladies”
started off with “selection before survey,” and
finished up with a eulogium on “ well-pressed
bricks,” was unanimously voted a humourist of
the first water.
The popular Mr. G. E. Labertouche,
officer in charge of Imperial pensions, at Sydney,

accounts.
Jufjt 130 ycais ago VV. 13. Dailey and Henry
Parkes were despatched to England as emigration
lecturers, but the mission was a failure. Dailey
on his return said that he could never get any good
of that man Parkes, as he was always hankering
after the aristocracy, a class of immigrant the
colony did not want. What Parkes said of Dailey
is not recorded.

Henry George has resigned the editorship
of the N.Y. Standard to W. T. Oroasdale, who
has in reality been its mainstay for a considerable
time. Viewed from afar, the Standard seems to
have been waning in interest for some time. A
one-stringed musical instrument can scarcely pro-
duce discord, but its music soon becomes mono-
tonous.
While thousands of unemployed are
clamouring for work throughout the province,
Queensland Government is spending £13,000 in
indenting plantation labour from Italy; and
Lecturer Randall is also mustering immigrant
recruits wholesale at 'Ome.
Remarks the Northern Miner :—“ The
black labour party have not lost all hopes of being
able to bring about the repeal of the statutes
against alien immigration. If this were not so
we should not see the unholy alliance between the
separatist agitators within the colony, and the
absentee representatives in London, who are almost
all coloured-labour advocates, and who lose no
opportunity of declaring that Queensland cannot
be settled by white men. It is abundantly clear
that, separation and black labour have not yet
been completely disassociated in anything but
mere name. ”
1 hackeray’s pon-and-pencil sketches of
Barnes Neweome lecturing on the Affections
might be paralleled by Governor Hopetoun lec-
turing the Australian Natives on Commemoration
Day. He admitted that the United States and
France were “Stable Republics,” but remarked
that if a man hints about an empire or a monarchy
in Paris, he will be run in; wherefrom we must
draw the conclusion that anyone who hints an
Australian Republic ought to be run in. But,
then, how were the U.S. and French Republics
started ? How did they reach their present noble
stable state? Did they peacefully grow out of
the Victoria Regina flower of a crown to the
white lilies of the Republic ?
A New York constable, whose business it
is to see ladies over a crossing in Broadway,
says;—
“ I have been here for many years on duty now, and
between you and me the women are getting liner every
day. It’s a fact that they are putting up big muscle
lately. I don’t know whether it’s the gymnasium or beef-
steaks, but where a big and hard arm on a girl was a
rarity ten years ago, it is not a scarce thing now. Did
you ever know that an arm can say a good deal? I
believe there is as much eloquence in a girl’s arm as in
her eyes. Some of them also flirt with their arms. Kow,
I’m a pretty well-battered old chap, but darn me if there
ain’t a lot of giddy things flutter across here every day
that send all sorts of telegraphic signs through their
arms at me whenever I help them over the street.”
Tone up the system and improve the appetite
by taking Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It will make you
feel like a new person. Thousands have found
health by the use of this great blood-purifier,
when all other means failed.
We notice with pleasure that the Equitable

myre, which should be a guarantee that clients will
be fairly dealt with. In these days of extortion, the

(FOR THE BULLETIN)
Bold self-seeker, ever pressing
To the land of wealth and fame,
With the pious patter-word upon your lip,
Still the traitor thought caressing—
Masquer in a borrowed name,
Despair, for Xruth. has let her sleuth-hounds slip*
With a Bible in your pocket
You’ve advanced by fraud and trick
To the realm of notoriety and pelf:
He that riseth like a rocket
May come downward like a stick,
For hypocrisy at last defeats itself.
Brute-like courage and endurance
Mix with cunning in your mould,
You have fought ’against fearful odds with might
and main ;
You’ll not fail for self-assurance
But there’s blood upon your gold
And on your brow the awful brand of Cain.
J. LE GAY BRENTON
In consequence of a leak in a cylinder-
cover, the water-supply of Bathurst, N.S.W., was
suspended for three days. But the residents
never knew it, bless yer !
The experience of Police-Inspector Mor-
row, of Walgett, N.S.W., is that “the rising
generation is not so fond of drink as their fathers
were.” Good experience in bad grammar.
Jerome K. Jerome, Louis Stevenson, and
other writers of fiction have just been called upon
to pay the last dread penalty of success. Their
alleged portraits, under the description of “ Popu
lar Authors,” are now to be seen scowling and
squinting at mankind from the blotchy columns
of Melbourne ’Erald, and a vague hope that
literary men were not quite as bad as one might
think has given place, day by day, to the horrible
conviction that such people are a dashed sight
worse than anybody ever imagined. The murderers
and perpetrators of criminal assaults, who in days
of yore almost monopolised the ’Erald’s Chamber
of Horrors, were things of sweetness and light as
compared with these popular authors. Their
faces are balls of evil passion, .and their noses are
mostly indented by the brand of Cain. Narrow
slanting eyes betray their Mongolian origin, and
the way they plaster their front hair upon criminal
heads stamps them as football-barraokers of the
most depraved kind. It were hard to say for
certain which of them is Jack the Ripper, because
there may be more “cuts” to follow. In the
meantime we suggest that every available Popular
Author ought to be arrested on suspicion and
hanged without the option of a fine, because the
world won’t hold enough sin and wickedness to
keep literary genius up to the frightful pitch of
its portraits in the ’Erald.
As a hair dressing and renovator, Ayer’s Hair
Vigor is universally commended. It eradicates
dandruff, cures eruptions of the scalp, invigorates
and beautifies the hair, and prevents its fading or
turning gray.
In some verses headed “ The Native
‘ National Ode— 1891! ’ ” Mr. Unknown-Christian-
Name Freeman has had a fine joke with the Aus-
tralian Natives Ass’n. Ho sent them a rhymed
joke—they missed the fun and awarded the rhyme
a ten pound note. We translate the joke so that
even a native companion may catch on :
Fair Land of Morning, evergreen
(where long-drawn-out droughts ne’er trouble the strug-
gling farmer.)
Dear favoured home of Peace serene
(land of the fiercest industrial conflict the world has
known—land of blackfellovv-battues and the Eureka
Stockade)
Where plenty pours her brimming horn
(on benevolent asylums, refuges, and the Vagrancy Act),
Where flies a flag unstained, untoru
(proudly waving on the anniversary of Convicts’ Day.
Motley is the only wear!)
Hail, brothers, hail !
Where free beneath thy sunny skies
Man may to fullest manhood rise !
Hail, hail, Australia !
The large supply of hail is a joke on the “sunny
skies ” business which also gracefully implies
reference to the people sweetly sleeping nightly in
Sydney Domain and Eitzroy Gardens ; while the
idea of a man rising to fullest manhood in a de-
pendency which cannot keep out Chinese scum
without appeals to a foreign “Privy Council,” is
the unkindest cut of all. Mr. Freeman’s fund of
humour is most graphically illustrated in a line of
splendid alliterative bombast where he invokes
and re-sexes Australia as follows :
“ August old Albion’s gallant son / ”
The Choicest Jewellery. Dahms & Co., King-st. Arcade
Somebody lias been forging Foster’s beer
labels in Brisbane. However, Foster needn’t care.
No one can successfully forge his beer.
Dean Mahony, of Sydney, now in Ireland,
has sent £5 to the Irish Tenants’ Defence Fund.
What, we wonder, are his reverence’s ideas re
the Parnell-O’Shea biz? We wonder if Parnell
used to swing the O’Shea.
Parramatta is arching its back and spitting
out protests against being made a central depot
for the reception and maintenance of prisoners,
madmen and mendicants. Parramatta is not yet
fully seized of its natural vocation.
Several times last year the N.S.W*
Supreme Court dealt with attorneys who had re'
tained their clients’ money. Early this year the
Court will be asked to say whether those attorneys
who retain junior barristers’ fees —they can’t get
tick from the senior bar—should not also be dealt
with. In England a solicitor was recently
suspended for 12 months for non-payment of fees
to Counsel. As the attorneys get the money from
their pigeons expressly to pay barristerial fees,
the retention of the fees clearly amounts to a mis-
appropriation of trust-funds.
At a meeting held recently in the East
end of London one frowsy individual, who smelt
like a billiard-room full of stale gin, alluded to
this country six times as “ qur colonial possess-
ions.” Every miserable Britisher who whoops at
a dog-fight in a Whitechapel pub. still fancies that
he owns Australia, and thinks that Parkes and
Higinbotham and Mcllwraith and Atkinson and
everybody else out here are somehow his private
property. And when he hears that N.S.W. or
Queensland is manifesting disloyal sentiments he
invariably states that “ we —which is himself and
the bald-headed man who is drunk under the
table—will have to put this sort of thing down
with a strong ’and.”
Let no one deceive himself. Sydney,
with a sewerage system, has a larger death-rate
from filth-diseases—typhoid, diphtheria, &c. —
than Melbourne without a sewerage system.
Why? Because of the • penurious landlordism
and jerry-plumbing—not Jersey-plumbing, dear
printer!— of the City of the Beautiful Har-
bour. Up to now every landlord has
been able to do in Sydney just as he liked.
Until Sydney has a proper Building Act pro-
viding for rigid inspection and with penal clauses
tacked to it, the Cornstalks will go on Journeying
midden-wafted to Abraham’s bosom in the same
old way. The Australasian Builders and Con-
tractors’ News, which commenced the crusade
against the jerry-plumbers and heartless rent-
gobblers of Sydney, has rendered a service to the
State.

Captain Rossi, of Goulburn Cathedral
notoriety, must at length have reached the height
of his ambition : he has put in the foundations of
about three healthy lawsuits. So careful is the
Captain with his proofs that he got himself

A Parramatta man has been fined 40s. and

Contrary to all railway precedents and
usage, the trains in Queensland are said to run
“up into the country” and “ down to town,
whereas in every other railway system the terms
are ‘‘ up to town ” and “ down into the country.”
The Queensland Railway Commissioners are said
to have been insensibly influenced into this
transposition of adverbs by the familiar habit of
old colonists in alluding to their inland travels as
being “ up the bush ” or “ up country.”
AMERICA’S GREATEST STATESMAN
At one of the large dinners given at the seat of
government lately, the great orator said : “Permit
me, ladies and gentlemen, to say that there is no
drink in the world so conducive to social inter-
course as the famous St. Louis Lager Beer. As
a mental and physical relaxative it has no equal.
It refreshes the body and exhilarates the mind.
It gently moves the blood to accelerated action,
and arouses the more generous sentiments that
cluster around the human heart. Its action in-
spires noble thoughts, and at the banquet table,
with intellect and genius, it touches chords of
inspiration that prompt to lofty efforts.”
When the eyes become weak or the lids in-
flamed and sore, a scrofulous condition of the
blood is indicated. For scrofula, in all its forms,
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is the best remedy. It vitalizes
the blood and expels all humors.
UUR OWN INVESTIGATIONS.
FRON the DAILY NORTHERN TELEGRAPH.
Recent editorial comment by some of the most
influential papers in Great Britain, respecting the
value of an article which is extensively advertised,
has led us to make certain investigations on our
own behalf, in order that we might lay before our
readers facts which we had personally verified-
Advertisements are one thing, voluntary
editorial endorsement of the value of an article is
quite another thing. This latter occurs so very
rarely that it becomes all the more important.
From the report below it will be observed that
we have confined our investigations wholly to
local people. The reports are from well-known
citizens, which must carry conviction to the minds
of every thinking man and woman.
Messrs. Jackson and Co., of 9, Regent’s build-
ings, top of Penny-street, being among our leading
merchants, their opinion was first sought by us.
In answer to our inquiry Mr. Jackson states
that the article in question was one of the most
staple. Immense quantities were sold by him
every month, and the actual merit which it pos-
sessed was undoubtedly the cause of its being one of
the leading articles of trade in Blackburn. * * *
Among these cases which Mr. Jackson related
was that of a well-known society lady (whose
name we are not at liberty to publish), who had
been confined to her room for more than three
weeks by muscular rheumatism in the back,
during which time she was under the treatment
of one of our leading medical men ; but continued
from the first to grow worse. She was very much
prejudiced against advertised remedies, and al-
though repeatedly urged to try St. Jacobs oil she
persistently refused. Her sister, unbeknown to
her, procured a bottle of the oil from Messrs.
Jackson. The first application gave the lady
relief, and before the contents of one bottle was
used she was entirely free from pain. She felt so
grateful that she personally visited the store of
Messrs. Jackson, and told them the facts as above
narrated, and says that hereafter she shall advise
all her friends who have rheumatism to dismiss
their doctors and use St. Jacobs oil.
ATEXAS SIFTING.
F. G. Presby, Marshall, Texas, April 14, ’9O,
writes the Waterbury Watch Co. as follows :
“ Though a stranger to you I wish to let you know
something that happened to me in the spring of
1889 on account of one of your Waterbury
Watches. I left my home in Pensacola City, Fla.,
to find a new one farther west. Coming to Den-
ver, Colo., and having travelled all over the
Rocky Mountains without any watch in my
pocket, as I was coming one day from my place to
Denver, Colo., after I had got my place in order,
I came to look over the city. My intention was
to go to Kansas City, Mo. I passed one watch-
maker’s store on Larimer-street, in Denver, and
saw there a watch in the window for only 2dol.
50o.; I went and I bought one, paid the money for
it, and left the city next day for Kansas City,
Mo., in the 1 p.m. train. After I was about an
hour’s ride from the city the conductor of the
train came and took a seat by my side I asked
the conductor the time, and as a gentleman he
told me the time, and I said I also have my watch
to tell me the time. As soon as the gentleman
(conductor) of the train espied my watch he com-
menced to laugh, and told me at the same time he
could get a bushel of such trash as Waterbury
Watches, all he wanted, for one dollar, while
I had paid 2dol. 50c. But I did not lose
my courage, and told the conductor that I
would bet a cigar, only first that I was not a
betting man, and secondly that my Waterbury
Watch for 2.50d0l was just as good as an Elgin
or any other 250.00d0l watch, in regard to keep-
ing good time. The conductor accepted the bet.
Nearing Kansas City next day I notified the con-
ductor about our bet. When we reached Kansas
City my 2.50d0l Waterbury Watch was correct
and the conductor’s watch from Elgin, 111., was
1| minute behind time, so the Waterbury Watch
won the bet. I have received the cigar, have set
fire to it, and am enjoying the smoke.”

_ CADBURY'S COCOA is closely allied to
milk in the large proportion of flesh-forming and
strength-sustaining elements that it contains. Uis pre-
pared oii the principle of excluding the superabundance
of fatty indigestible matter with which Cocoa abounds
—supplying a refined thin infusion of absolutely pure
Cocoa, exhilarating and refreshing, for Breakfast, Lun-
cheon, Tea or Supper, giving staying power and im-
parting new life and vigour to growing children, and
those of delicate constitutions.
The Woman-Preacher's Baby.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Yes, mate, I was here during the great
gold rush and saw the seamy side of diggings’ life
from the start till the excitement died out. We
were a rough lot at Carey’s Flat, a mixture of
all sorts—neither birth nor colour nor creed made
any difference, for the object of pursuit was the
same. We all wanted gold, and knew little and
cared less about anything else.
“Carey s Flat wasnoplacefor a woman, you may
imagine, and yet a woman, a young thing she
was, too, came in amongst that rough lot and
settled down. It was a strange tiling for her to
do, but, then, Janet Ray was a strange woman,
not like anyone I ever saw. She was a preaching-
woman, a regular Dinah Morris, who fancied she
had 1 a call ’ and could do these miners some
good. It was curious to see the effect her preach,
ing had on the men, and the hold she gradually
got of them. She was a working woman, nothing
at all of the fine lady about her, and so timid, you
could scarcely hear her voice when she spoke, if
she wasn’t preaching. But when she stood up in
the long summer evenings, and the men gathered
round her to hear what she had to say, then there
came a change over her. Her voice rang out clear
as a bell, there was a light in her face like that
you might fancy an angel would own, and you
wouldn’t think she was the same creature. I
could never rightly remember what she had been
saying after it was all over, any more than I could
tell you the notes of a bit of soft-played music that
had satisfied my nature, without my understand-
ing it, but I know I used to feel lifted off my feet
as I listened to her, and carried up to some lovely
sphere where I could see green fields and flowers,
and hear birds singing and water sparkling.
That’s how the preaching affected me, and I’d like
to see the one who wouldn’t be made a better man
by having his feelings stirred that way. Generally
the men were very quiet while she was preaching,
as quiet as if they were sitting in a swell church,
with cushions on the seats, and a dim light coming
through the coloured windows. Sometimes there
would be a bit of a row at the edge of the crowd
when the fellows had been drinking, and then
you’d see two or three of them who were listening
to her words jump up and clear off the rowdies in
a twinkling.
* * *
“ There was one big fellow whom we noticed
before long was always first in defending Janet
from any little annoyance—Charlie Strauss, a
good-natured, quiet German, and he was always
nearest to her when she was preaching. He
seemed to be counting every word that fell from
her lips, but was so seemingly content with watch-
ing her that he didn’t much heed their meaning.
We soon saw that Charlie meant to marry the
little preacher, and I don’t think he had much
trouble in persuading Janet, for she had a sort of
fancy for him from the first. We saw them go off
together early one morning, and when they came
back Charlie told me they were man and wife,
having been tied up properly by a bush missionary
who was visiting a town some miles off.
“They settled down comfortably, and seemed to
rub along happily enough until their youngster
was born, and then things changed a bit. From
that time Janet seemed to be off her head. She
took a dislike to the place, and to every soul in it,
even to poor Charlie. She said we were a godless
lot, and declared we were all going stiaight to
perdition. It appeared that she had had a vision,
in which the Lord spoke to her, telling her that He
had sent her this child, who was to be dedicated
to His service. She hugged the boy in her arms
and would not let any of us touch him lest we
should pollute him, and declared that she must go
away with him to some better place where she
could bring him up aright. She said he was des-
tined to be a great preacher, and she was anxious
to lose no time in having him baptised. She was
always trying to get away with the baby, and
Charlie had a time of it looking after her. He
would have gone off with her when he saw how
her mind was set on it, only there was a good
prospect before him of making something out of
his claim after all his months of hard work, if he
only held on a little, and he tried in vain to per-
suade her to wait for a while. He might as well
have talked to his pick. At last he thought if he
could get the child away from her and into safe
keeping somewhere she would, perhaps, fret a
while after it, but would be more content to stay
where she was. Charlie was . as good as half-a-
dozen when it came to a row, but he wasn’t much
of a hand at solving a problem so he made arrange-
ments with the family of a settler living away
back in the bush to take the child, and said he
would send it to them by Fred, a teamster, who
would be travelling in their direction. He got
the baby away from its mother and handed it
over to Fred, who was a careless, drunken savage
and misunderstood things, and thinking Charlie
wanted to be rid of the boy altogether, he pitched
the poor little chap down an old claim on his way
from the diggings, and thought he had done a
good turn. Aye, those were rough days ; human
life wasn’t thought of much account in those
times.
“When Janet found out her loss she rushed about
like as though she were stark, staring mad. It
touched the hardest heart to see the agony in that
poor thing’s face. She didn’t suspect her husband
of having had a hand in the child’s disappearance;
she thought some of the men had taken it to
punish her for the way she had been speaking of
them.
‘ This lasted for some days and then some of the
fellows couldn’t stand it any longer—they told
Charlie they would tell her where the youngster
was, if he didn’t tell her himself. Charlie, poor
fellow, did as he was bid, and the next thing we
saw was him and his wife setting off for the
hut in the bush to bring the little chap back.
“ We never knew what happened when they
reached the hut and found the child wasn’t there;
we only knew that they came back and lived for a
little while in the old place, and that Janet
accused her husband of having destroyed the
child. Nothing could shake her in that belief
and she neither looked at him nor spoke to him
from morning to night.
“ Some men would have killed her, but Charlie
was very patient with her for all his misery, and
bore with her whatever she did.
“At length she disappeared one night. We
searched for her, but couldn’t find a trace of the
poor creature. We thought she had likely fallen
down a claim in her wanderings, and searching
there for her we found the body of her little lost
boy. _ ■
“Nothing was heard of her fate till some months
afterwards, and then her skeleton was found in
the bush where she had wandered off the track
and perished from hunger.
“ Charlie left the diggings. He never could bear
the place after his trouble. I daresay he drank
himself to death long before that poor skeleton in
the bush was brought to light,”

Gem from Tamwoktii (N.S.W.) Ob-

A Frenchman has hanged himself ufc
Broken Hill, leaving behind a paper bearing the
words :—“ No work, no money, no board, Uo
lodging ; an end with horrors is better than
horrors without end.” Why didn’t he wait fot
that letter on “ The False Fight of Socialism,” in
which the O, Silly-Vane states that the,desire to
live is the main incentive to work. The suicide’s
desire to obtain work should have been strong
enough to sustain his life whether the opportunity
to work was afforded or not. At least that’s the
gospel according to O’Sullivan.
The sentence of death passed on Rodney
Claud Spencer at Port Darwin has been commuted
to imprisonment for life. Spencer is an aristo-
cratically-connected vagabond, who, when he
committed the crime, was a buffalo-hunter in the
Northern Territory. There can be no doubt what-
ever that if the victim had been a white man
instead of a blackfellow, Spencer would have been
hanged, for, according to the evidence, a more
deliberate and cowardly murder was never com-
mitted in this world. Spencer simply shot the
defenceless black in cold blood in his own camp.
Melbourne Land Mortgage Bank, which
borrows London cash at 4 per cent., and ladles it
out locally in sky palaces, etc., declared 12| per
cent, dividend last week, but there is always
some nasty shareholder, with his douche of cold
water, just when the whole meeting is one broad
grin of delight. Thus did one Walker get up,
and suggest that only 10 per cent, should be paid,
because look at the Premier Evanescent, and how
wise it was to have a big reserve fund. But the
Reverend Mr. Fulford was on hand, and oh ! he
did speak ! “Mr. Chairman,” said he, “are we
to turn a banquet into a mere feast ?” Trust your
Fulford.
If Lady Burton, widow of the great ex-
plorer and Oriental scholar, can raise the money,
the last resting-place of her illustrious husband
and herself will be novel and appropriate. Mort-
lake is the spot chosen, and Lady Burton says ;
“ The ground is lift, by Oft. This is to be covered
by a dark stone Arab tent. In the tent, above
ground, are to be two slabs to hold two coffins
(let me have a little place by his side) and room
for a small altar at their head. He is embalmed,
and I shall be, so there is no danger to health.
Outside the tent, above the flap curtain which
serves as door, will be a marble crucifix, under it
a ‘ Book of Life,’ on one side his name and death
recorded, the other page blank for me. tinder
the book will be inscribed Justin McCarthy’s
beautiful sonnet of fourteen lines, which embraces
all his life. The expenses of the interment and
monument will be £390, a very heavy expense for
me in my altered circumstances. Should anything
be done to help I shall be very grateful, but in no
way hurt should nothing come of it.”
Longevity.
It is likely that a tendency to longevity is fre-
quently inherited—that it runs in families. We
know that a lack of vitality, weakness of constitu-
tion and a tendency to certain diseases are trans-
missible. Presuming that nature never indicates
any physiological preference for individuals, We
can account for this principle of preservation by
the fact that in all large families the wbakest and
diseased die out, leaving only the healthy ahd
most hearty to propagate. With such sOuhd
stock, long life through successive generations is
the result; If the truth must be told plainly
death is usually a species of Suicide. People Seeih
to set upon the mode of life which will kill theitl
quickest. Too much eating and tob little slebp-
ing, stimulants, reckless dissipation', brains over-
burdened with business, hearts harrowed With
Oates and responsibilities of life —such are the
things that hurty folks into early graves. Worry
and nervous excitement kill people quicker than
wars and famines; The great fault with man-
kind is that it fails to take notice of the first warn-
ings which nature sends. Let a person suffer a
simple (as she or he thinks) symptom, let it bfe
headache, sleeplessness, indigestion or neuralgia,
it is a common retnark for them to say, “ Oh ! it’s
nothing, let it go as it came;” Such symptoms
always precede serious attacks Of disease* and if
such warnings were appreciated, how much misery,
suffering and even life itself might be saved. A
few shillings invested in two or three bottles of
Clements Tonic will ward off disease, cteate a
healthy apipetite, stimulate the liver and kidneys,
and compel all the organs to properly perform
their functions. Mr. James O’Leary, Goulburn,
(N.S.W.) writes : —“ In 18(35 I was gold-mining in
Victoria and was attacked by typhoid fever which
laid me on a sick bed for seven months; I was
delirious most of the time, so cannot say exactly
what happened to me during that period ; all that
I know is that for seven or eight years afterwards
I was continually in the hands of the doctors, who
somehow did not seem able to grapple with the
peculiarities of my case; they finally advised a
sea voyage. I went to Europe, stayed there some
months, caught a severe cold in the trying English
winter, which turned to pleurisy and laid me at
death’s door for the second time. I was carried
on to the steamer to come to Australia, as I
thought, to die ; however, the voyage revived me
a little and I could walk with the help of a stick.
On arrival at Sydney, I read of the wonderful
effects of Clements Tonic in restoring enfeebled
strength. I got a bottle, felt better, got another,
felt oetter still, then another and another and
kept at it till I had taken ten bottles, and I felt
as if 50 years had been taken off my life ; more
like a man of 30 than ohe of 83. It completely
restored my strength and health and 1 believe it
is the most wost wonderful medicine the world
has seen, for Clements Tonic made a young man
of me, when doctors, their physic and their sea
voyages failed. This is a fact and there is no
denying such facts. I am now 85 years of age,
have married my fifth wife within the last two
years and have a son under six months old, and
hope to live another 20 years. I think that says
something in favour of Clements Tonic.”

The Cook’s Horse.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Hr wasn’t our cook; that is, he was not in the
hut, and he wasn’t the shearers’ cook, nor even the
rOuseabouts’ cook. But he was in charge of the
barracks kitchen. The barracks are where the
tangies live, and the rangies are the jackeroos,
which (Bible for this grammar) are colonial ex-
periences, which are pannikin-overseers, which
are relations of the owners, which are which—for
I could replicate ad nauseam. But to our cook.
He came out in a white cap and apron, and
“headed ’em”; he headed’em well, and won a
little. Then he ipade a match at draughts, and
lost five shillings, and the station champion played
him for a fiver with eleven men, and lost, so the
chef was £4 15s to the good in the chequers. He
would not play euchre because the blacks play it,
and he would not play forty-fives because he was
not Irish, and his knuckles couldn’t stand the
bang on the table, but he’d play crib, and he some-
times won, sometimes lost —generally the former :
a quiet, unassuming old sport, who was always
being had by the boys for sixpence or a bob ; but
it takes a lot of sixpences to make a sovereign.
Then a teamster came along just before the
races —the station races, you know—and he had a
lame horse. The teamster called him “Bally,”
because he had a white face. He did not know
the cook, but offered to sell “Bally’’for a fiver,
and let in the poor old cook, who was rather proud
of having a horse.
Now some devil incarnate (taken from the
Snivelling Snooze) filled the old man up with
whisky, and persuaded him to subscribe a pound
and enter “Bally” for divets races at the annual
shearers’ meeting. 1 fancied he entered for every
race; but he insisted oil changing the horse’s
name to “ Ruin,” because he said the races would
ruin him. Gripes! (colonial for Oarambo) it did
amuse us to see the slushy careering about on his
ruin. We did not treat him fairly : we knew his
weakness and got at him with a nobbier or two,
until he had backed “Ruin” to win the Hack
Race, the Handicap, the Blue Gum Stakes and
the Hurdle Race. Then w’e began to think the
toan was mad, that his madness had been caused
by some swindle, and that it was for this reason
he always stipulated “first past the post, play or
pay.”
Then the races came on. I had almost forgotten
to mention that cash was the cook’s motto. He
posted his coin and we had to do the same.
The Bally horse was turned out on Cunning-
ham’s Flat, and was never seen until the night
before the races, when the teamster (who had sold
him to the cook) brought him in, looking well for
a grass-fed horse, but we began to ponder when
the cook removed his shoes. They came off so
nicely that he must have taken off such shoes
before, or else they had been badly put on. At
any rate, “ Ruin ” was in the stall in the morning,
and though plastered with mud he looked well
enough.
Oft the course the cOok was drunk and the
teamster was nearly so, but the latter had appar-
ently become thinner, perhaps through sickness.
They were both taking bets in a reckless manner,
posting the cash. Here the agreeable part of rny
tale ends, for “Ruin” won all his races. Mind
you, he was lame and muddy, but he won, and
the teamster rode him. I fancy the cook and the
teamster won a couple of hundred. They left
after shearing. Perhaps the most extraordinary
part of this yarn is that the “gun-room” people
say that the owner of “ Ruin ” was a d d good
cook and was always up in time. After the man-
ner of ACsop (but he was so long that it puts me in
mind of beer) I give a moral—and here, in paren-
thesis, I may remark that the cook had a moral
certainty. His horse was old “ Hector,” which
(for the sex again, vide Holy Writ) had won—
never mind what he won.
Moral: Don’t trust book or booky by the bind-
ing. This opens a mine of discussion. I have no
time to analyse trust and book and binding.
SCOTTY THE WRINKIER.
One Croydon (N.Q.) paper describes its
hated contemporary as: “Our poor, deah, old,
flat-chested, dribble-nosed, gummy-eyed contem-
porary, the Croydon green-gage.” Jack Hoolan,
M. takes credit for the adjectives.
Recently, a labour-agent in Dunedin,
N. advertised for 200 pick-and-shovel men to
proceed to Tasmania. Within two hours the
agent’s office was besieged by 600 navvies jumping
on each other for the chance of getting Is. an
hour.
Sample of the Sydney D.T.’s editorial
style : —“ If the whole sittings of the Convention
were held in secret, facilities for forming a true
conception of this great question in all its bearings
would be denied to the public which they should
be afforded at the earliest moment.” Phantas-
magorical flap doodle !
£j[The Strike Committee of the Central
District Council of Queensland has issued, to
shearers and rouseabouts, a manifesto, the con-
cluding sentence of which reads thus: —“If the
worst comes to the worst, we can always ride
down to Brisbane and ask a Government \hat
swamps the country with surplus labor, what it is
going to do with the 10,000 able-bodied busbmen
unemployed because they hang out for the fair
thing.”
Bill Beacom, known all over the Far North
as “ Greasy Bill,” (he used to boast that he “could
smell gold,”) and who was murdered by Papuan
cannibals on Sud Est Island, New Guinea, some four
months ago, was once an indefatigable prospector
at Charters Towers. Bill (whose nickname was
derived from the fact that when once he put on a
suit of clothes he never doffed them until they
showed symptoms of dropping off him) was work-
ing alone and was murdered principally for his
swag of “ tombaggo.” He was pinned to the
earth with spears, and, while writhing in torture,
his head was cut off. Then his liver and heart
were cooked and eaten by “the Hill” men at a
great roast feast. The news of his murder didn’t
leak out for three months. Then the incensed
miners on Sud Est burned some villages, and, by
threats, obtained from the chiefs the surrender of
the chief murderers, who Were promptly chained
up, and, later on, handed over to Sir William
Macgregor, Administrator of New Guinea. The
miners complain that Macgregor “ sympathises
with the natives, and is treating the miners as
lawless adventurers,” he having refused even to
leave a boat as a means towards their escape in
the event of a native rising. Yet the Adminis-
trator has embalmed his own questionable rush
through the Louisiades group in an official report
to the Queensland Government, as a feat of which
he is extremely proud. Poor old “ Greasy ” had
the reputation of being “ generally the first at a
rush and the longest to stay.”
From Albert Edward’s public reference to
out late lamented Oaringtoti as “my friend of
40 years’ standing,” we gather that the Baron
(who has in all 2400 tenants working for him and
providing him with money) began to shout drinks
for his Royal Nibs at a very early age.
A Sydney Sunday paper has started 6
column devoted to “ Scotch Humorous Poetry.”
We see no reason why the wild-eyed aboriginal
Muse of Wales shouldn’t have a show as well, so
here goes :
John Vicars and Co., of Sussex-street,
Sydney, dismissed the other day from their wool-
factory three old and capable employes, appar-
ently for tlo Other reason than that they were
prominent trades-unionists and had besought the
firm to ameliorate the Condition Of their work-
people, more especially their child-labourers. The
bull’s-eye bf enquiry has since revealed some ugly
facts. The children in Vicars’ wool-factory work
from 6 in the morning till 6 at night, with a break
of half-an-hour for breakfast and three-quarters-
of-an-hour for dinner, except on Saturdays, which
are half-holidays. All hands in the factory work
60 hours per week, and the children often work
overtime till 9 o’clock at night, some of the
overtime being paid at the rate of one
penny per hour! This tariff is impugned
by John Vicars, but the children them-
selves affirm it. A 12-year-old boy declared
that he worked 15 hours a day—till 9 o’clock p.m.
—when he was on nightwork ; wages, 6s. 6d. per
week ; overtime, Id. per hour. His brother, aged
14 years, received 9s. 6d. per week, and Id. per
hour for overtime, and, during the previous fort-
night had gained 38 pence by such over-perspira-
tion. A 13-year-old lad had achieved sore eyes
over his work, for which he was paid 7s. per week,
and Id. per hour overtime. Another of the same
age “ worked 60 hours a week for 6s. He was in
the drying-loft where the heat was intense, and if
he lifted his head he would bump it against the
corrugated-iron roof. He could sometimes wash
himself in perspiration, and wring it out of his
clothes.” Girls received the same overtime in-
ducements and compulsions. Many of the
children live in distant suburbs and have to rise
before daylight in order to reach their work in
time, as late attendances are punished by fines.
A deputation from the men in the factory was the
prelude to the dismissal of three of their number
—William Welch (President of the Textile
Workers’ Association), 151 years with the firm;
James Beattie (Vice-President of the T.W.A.),
and William Hunter (secretary of do.) The firm
deny that prominent unionism has anything to do
with their dismissals, but it is a curious coincidence
that the three principal officers of the trade-unioni
should be selected as scapegoats to the exigency of
factory interests. All the workers at Vicars and
Co, are under strenuous conditions. They get no
pay for any holiday, nor for any absence in con-
sequence of sickness. The Trades and Labour
Council has promised to assist the Textile
Workers, who are now thoroughly angry. What
is better, the female employes have promised to
statid by the ineti.
Charles Bradlaugh, Atheist, Malthusian,
Republican and Individualist; son of a solicitor’s
clerk, was born in London, September; 1838, and
educated chiefly at the National sOhOol, Bethhal
Green. Errand boy in the office where his father
spent his life, he then became clerk to a cOal-
merchant. At this time, preparing for confirma-
tion, he discovered that the thirty-nine articles
were contradictory. Parsonical suspension conse-
quent thereon from Sunday-school duties and his
defeat in a debate on Biblical inspiration, shook
his faith and he finally became a declared Free-
thinker when he was further confirmed in his
antagonism to religion by the action of the cleric
who got him dismissed from his situation on his
refusal to recant and influenced his parents against
him. At seventeen years of age he left home and
started without capital as a coal dealer, failed,
went hawking braces, and found a home with the
widow of Richard Garble, in whose house he
studied Latin, Greek, Arabic and other tongues.
In debt and hopelessly in love with Hypatia
Garble, he enlisted in the 7th Dragoon Guards,
where his awkwardness made him the butt of the
regiment till he thrashed its bully. A bad horse •
mail, he was sodii appointed orderly-room clerk,
but, inheriting it small sum by the death of ail
aUiit, bought his discharge and went to the aid
of his widowed mother. Again he began at the
bottom Of the laddeir as factotum to a solicitor at
10s. weekly, but was soon promoted to a position of
trust. He then married a Mist Hooper, and, the
tolerance of his employer allowing him to lecture;
quickly made a reputation and was engaged to
deliver lectures whenever legal duties permitted;
His defeat of numerous representatives pf ortho-
doxy, lay and clerical, caused much ill-feeling;
and his life was endangered on various occasions.
He was then articled to a solicitor, with whom he
entered into partnership, but the connectioh only
plunged him into debt. Some attempts were
made from time to time to prevent his
lecturing, but Bradlaugh successfully fought
out the issue in the higher law-courts, and
at the death of John Watts assumed the
secular leadership. Shortly after, his talented
defence of the National Reformer secured a
repeal of certain obnoxious obstacles to publica-
tion. At this period Bradlaugh, though earning
about a thousand pounds yearly, was content to
live in a three-and-sixpenny East End lodging,
devoting his earnings to paying off the liabilities
incurred in the law business and to fighting the
foes of free speech and a free press. Amongst
other things Bradlaugh has been charged with
drawing up the 1867 proclamation of the Irish
Republic. Travelling in defence of liberty
he had many adventures in Italy, France.
Spain, and America, and was once arrested
by the agents of Bomba as a Garibal-
dian, but escaped through his personal daring.
After many vicissitudes and four attempts he was
elected for Northampton, in April, ’BO, and took
his seat on July 2nd of the same year. The
attempts made to exclude him from the House
over the affirmation question and his parliamen-
tary conduct are too well-known to require revival
in these columns, suffice it to say that in Brad-
laugh the world has lost a man who for earnestness,
courage, purity and clear headedness was not
excelled by any of his contemporaries.

The main objects of the Company, briefly stated, are 1. To establish an Irrigation Colony at
Mulgoa, near Sydney, in the colony of New South Wales. 2. To purchase and acquire the rights and
privileges of the promoters, Messrs. George Chaffey and Henry Gorman, granted under the Act of
Parliament called the Mulgoa Irrigation Act. This Act was passed by the Parliament of New South
Wales in December, 1890, and enables and authorises Messrs. George Chaffey and Henry Gorman
“ to establish a system of irrigation and water supply within and adjacent to the police district of
Penrith, to acquire lands to establish irrigation works, to authorise the sale and supply of water for
irrigation and domestic use, and to construct, make, and lay dams, weirs, or floodgates upon or across
the Nepean and Warragamba Rivers, and for all other purposes which may be incidental thereto.”
And 3. To exercise the rights under the- provisional contracts made by the promoters or on their behalf
with the owners of the lands proposed toi be irrigated, and which are set forth hereunder,
The estates which in the first instance-it is proposed to form into an Irrigation Colony (the first
in New South Wales), consisting of nchi,, fruit-growing, horticultural lands, suitable for the growth of
oranges, lemons, apricots, peaches, nectarines, vines, &c., in area about 20,000 acres in all, situated in
the County of Cumberland!, 30 miles or thereabouts from Sydney, in the parishes of Mulgoa, Clare-
mont, Melville, and. Rooty Hill,, and extending to-within a mile of the railway station of the pro-
sperous town of Penrith, and adjoining St. Mary’s on the Great Western Line of Railway, form the
key to the whole country round* Mulgoa. These can be irrigated from the Nepean and Warragamba
Rivers, andi i t is- proposed to. sell these lands in blocks of 5 and 10 acres and upwards, with water rights
attached. The-actual cost of the land will be under £l2 per acre, and the time required for carrying
out the works; so. a*s to. commence supplying water it is estimated will be within nine months. The
promoters confidently expect that these blocks,, with the water rights, will realise a profit of from £25
to, £5O per acre;.
The genuineness of this enterprise and the practical skill of the Messrs. Chaffey (the head of which
firm, Mr. George Chaffey, CIE., will be the consulting engineer) are sufficient guarantees that this
great creative work, the first in New South Wales, will be carried out in a profitable way, and on a
scalp-nob before attempted! in, this colony.,
Messrs. Chaffey Brothers have successfully established irrigation colonies at Etiwanda and
Onbarip,, in, California, where the lands improved by the growth of vineyards, orange and lemon
! groves, Sec,, have been sold at from £250 to £3OO per acre..

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS,
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,

Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.

Port Adelade, October 30, 188 G.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned :
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known

been may take advantage of them.

Wolfe’s Schnapps for lowness of spirits.
There are twice as many sheep in Austra-
lia as in Ilustia.
A good bed companion—Wolfe’s Schnapps.
It is said that Mrs. O’Shea went to Paris
to confer with O’Brien regarding a compromise.
Wolfe’s Schnapps—for the liver and kidneys.
The Storekeeper (N.S.W.) has a yarn

You really ought to drink Wolfe’s Schnapps.
An Auckland (N.Z.) youth lately found
himself, by the death of his father, the owner of
£30,000, which he immediately proceeded lo
squander on old wines and young women at the
rate of £5OOO a week. Being summoned by a Cin-
galee hawker for £4O —the cost of silk handker-
chiefs purchased for demi-rnondaines I—he1 —he was
found to be “ too barmy with the fantods ” to be
able to attend. In the event of his soul floating
out on the ebb-tide of alcohol, it was calculated
that he would not leave sufficient money to pay
his funeral expenses.
If your liver troubles you take Wolfe’s Schnapps.
The irreverent Sydney correspondent of a
N.S.W. journal on Governor Jersey :
Jersey himself looks a good deal like the husband of a
blue stocking. He is a small, thin, weedy-looking man,
though he is the ninth Earl of his race. He has a rather
backward crop of golden hair—red some people call St-
and whiskers to match same. His eyes are weak, and his
nose suits them, and he is so mournfully thin that an
expert standing behind him could see right through him
if he had a pane in his chest. He is short, but has large
feet, and when walking turns his toes in so much that he
has to step very high for fear of tripping over himself.
He is said to have established a reputation as an athlete in
his youth, and is credited with having run a hundred
yards in very short metre. I scanned him carefully from
head to hock at the official landing, and I think there
must be some mistake, or else that when he put up the
record for pedestrianism someone must have been chasing
him with a wood-axe.
Recommended by doctors—Wolfe’s Schnapps.
A good story is told of Edward Jenks,
Dean of the Faculty of Law of Melbourne Uni-
versity. At the recent examinations Dr.
MTnerney was appointed co-examiner in Roman
law. Professor Jenks, after setting the paper in
that subject, convened a meeting of the board—
himself and MTnerney—to draw up a paper.
After taking the chair, Jenks advised his confrere
to move a resolution against any question in the
paper that he objected to. The latter did so in
regard to several questions, and a vote was taken
each time with this result: For the motion—Dr.
MTnerney ; against—Prof. Jenks in propria per-
sona. Prof. Jenks exercised his casting vote as
chairman. The Professor and the Dr. no longer
play marbles in the same alley.
If in need of a stimulant take Wolfe’s Schnapps,
One Douglas Freshfield, a pillar of the
Charity Organisation Society, in London, gives an
instance of the “abuses” to which General
Booth’s scheme will be liable. He points to the
report of a case recently brought before the
Coventry magistrates, wherein a police-superin-
tendent stated that “ the Warwickshire roads
swarmed with vagrants, all going to London with
the same idea of getting something from General
Booth.” To the cold, organising mind of Fresh-
field, whose business in life is the squelching of
applicants for charity, there is something very
reprehensible in a bare-footed tramp of 100 miles
through the snow, made by a man who cherishes
expectations of vetting something in the way of
food and work at the end of his journey.
Although not quite clear as to where the abuse
comes in (unless he means that these poor
wretches, padding the hoof from the Midland
counties will let off bad language if the General
has nothing for them) Freshfield is sure that any
scheme for administering relief upon presumptive
evidence of starvation, unsupported by certificates
from three parsons and four old ladies is neces-
sarily dangerous. The Charity Organisation
Society has been established for many years, dis-
pensing large sums of money for the purchase of
stamps and stationery, and supporting scores of
deserving cases in snug office billets, yet it has
never encouraged a lot of nasty vagrants to come
forward with the idea of obtaining assistance in
any shape or form. Booth’s manifesto has already
produced this shocking result, and creatures that
might otherwise have remained satisfied to die in
the ditches of their native heath are plodding
along towards “Lunnon,” snuffing an imaginative
odour of butcher’s meat in the frosty air. Like
the Piper of Hamelin, at whose shrill invitation
myriads of rats from their retreats came tumbling,
the “General” lures swarms of human rodents
into the open, to the dismay and disgust of smug
respectability. If the well-to-do classes were
anxious for a practical illustration of the length,
breadth and depth of England’s poverty then this
condition of the Warwickshire roads might be re-
garded as chief amongst the uses of the shadowy
“Salvation ” scheme. But they are riot. Where-
fore the police, magistrates, and other professional
philanthropists are shaking their heads and dis-
covering possible “ abuses ” of charity in the fact
that so many vagrants are travelling such a weary
distance with no better idea than to get something.
If they get sent empty back again, society can
have no fault to find with the scheme, and every-
thing will be quite right as before.

The annual ocean race of the tea steamers
from Amoy to Australia with the first chops of

111b; N.S. Wales, Queensland, and South Aus-
tralia following, with 91b., 81b., and 71b ; next
comes the Cape of Good Hope, with 51b., which is
about the average in China itself, where they put
away about 2000 million pounds annually, the
whole world’s consumption being 2500 million
pounds. England consumes about 21b. per head,
and the United States a good deal less, Russia

Dr. W. Maloney, who with all his little faults,
is an outspoken Radical, received a hearty send-
off on a pleasure trip to Europe from his West
Melbourne constituents. Premier Muuro shed
his cold smile upon the bun voyage ceremony, and
appeared to take the moral of Maloney’s popu-
larity to heart. West Melbourne wanted its re-
presentative, to be a warm member as well as a
native. The doctor is considered to have filled
the billet. He never worships the fatted calf at
Government House, and he was the first to cry
out against the military terrorism of strike time.
The late Duke of Somerset succeeded his
venerable brother, and his venerable brother suc-
ceeds him. This is becoming as monotonous as was
the succession of Louis XVI., Louis XVIII., and
Charles X. in France, or the horrid line of old
men, the Georges and William, broken up by the
girl, Queen Victoria, who used to be so nice. The
three old brothers, St. Maur, enjoy a dismal suc-
cession of dukerv. The first venerable died 1885,
after doing all the good he could with a pungent
little book demolishing Democracy, and another
smashing up religion, with the zeal of a Queens-
berry going for a cornsack— or a coryphee. This
Somerset was a combination of Squire Wendover
in “Robert Els mere,” with Lord Dorincourt in
“Little Lord Fauntleroy.” A whole swarm of
distant relations are getting ready with their
curled little darling Lord Fauntleroys.
About forty years ago —as the white-haired
parent of melodrama usually commences his awful
revelations —a Nepaulese ambassador arrived at
Southampton with presents, valued at a quarter
of a million sterling, for Victoria Regina. Lord
John Russell gave instructions that the black
gentleman’s personal effects and those of his suite
were to be passed at the Customs free of duty,
but subsequently countermanded the first order,
and said that only the “ royal presents” (like
Lady Loch’s jewels) were to pass without inspec-
tion. Thereupon the ambassador gave Old
England the alternative of foregoing duty on the
whole bag of tricks, or of seeing presents and all
taken back to Nepaul by the ship that br ught
them. Then the Queen went into hysterics and
Prince Albert shrieked “ Mein Gott!” and the
black gentleman received Royal Letters Patent,
or something, to bring the presents along on any
terms he darned well liked. This incident is not
recorded in any modern history.

Samuel Samper (the first Mayor of Cook-
town and of late years manager of the Austra-
lasian Mining Exchange, Sydney) died the other
days, aged 48 years, sincerely regretted by all who
knew him. He was a German by birth, and
arrived in Australia 30 years ago, when he became
a pioneer of Gulgonsr, and since then had “fol-
lowed the goldfields” in N.S.W., New Zealand,
and Queensland. Mr. Samper was a Jew,
possessed of all the kindness of heart which is so
often accounted a Christian monopoly, and if to
him in the Great Unknown is measured out the
mercy which, as a diggings storekeeper, he ever
meted to the miner who was down on his luck and
to the widow and children of the man who had
gone under, then will Sam. —to whose ashes peace !
—be happy for evermore.

There is only one other ease oil record in
Australia where counsel instructed on one side
afterwards appeared for the other. Some years
ago Colonel Jeremiah Brazier, C.B., a retired
officer of the. Indian artillery—who had risen from
the ranks—was travelling in Australia with a
young friend, and while in Sydney they put up
for a few days at a hotel at Hyde. The Colonel
and his friend were about leaving for Maoriland,
and the latter failing to pay his hotel-bill a writ
was obtained and placed in the hands of a sheriff’s
officer who proceeded to the vessel to execute it.
The Colonel interfered to prevent the arrest of his
companion, and the officer unwisely arrested both
and lodged them in Darlinghurst. After 24 hours
detention the Colonel was released, and he imme-
diately entered an action against the sheriff. He
had Sir James Martin for him, while Attorney-
General Butler appeared for the Crown (or
sheriff), Sir Alfred Stephen was the judge. The
case had gone on for several days when a hitch
occurred and proceedings were stayed. Mean-
while, Sir Alfred resigned his position on the
bench, Parkes threw over Butler, to whom he had
promised the appointment, and gave it to Martin.
Butler, of course, resigned office, and Innes suc-
ceeded him. When the Brazier case came on
again Innes appeared for the Crown and Butler
for the Colonel. The latter won and got damages,
but the Government fought inch by inch, failing
finally before the Privy Council. The imputa-
tion by the Crown was that Brazier and his com-
panion were travelling and living immorally.
A deadbeat lately called at a shanty out
West looking for work, and was pi’omptly told
there wasn’t any. “Well,” said the sundowner,
“have you got any rats about this place?”
“ Rats ! Did you say rats ?” asked the shanty-
owner—•“ Rats ? why the place is alive with ’em.”
“ Well,’’exclaimed the deadbeat, “I’m your man.”
“Right you are; then start away and clear’em
out,” said the publican. “Good,” rejoined the
deadbeat. All day long he pottered about im-
bibing gratuitous beers and getting outside tooth-
some grub, yet made he no move towards shifting
the rats. Next morning the publican interviewed
him. “Touching the rats, I thought you were
going to make ’em scarce?” “Ah, yes,” said
the deadbeat, “about the rats; I reckon as
soon as I begin a rat will be a curiosity
about here.” “Well, begin as soon as you
like,” murmured the publican. “Right,” replied
the deadbeat. Another day passed during which
the deadbeat absorbed more eleemosynary grub
and beer, yet he made no attempt on the rats.
The second morning came and the publican again
interviewed him. “About those rats,” he re-
marked. “Ah, yes,” said the loafer, “touching
these rats. Well, as I said afore, this place won’t
be much troubled in the future by rats as soon as
I make a start on ’em.” “ That be d d !” said
the publican, “your game is pretty well played
out. Are you going to begin, or are you not ? ”
“Am I going to begin,” asked the deadbeat.
“Am I going to begin—just you get me what I
want and I’ll make those rats d d scarce.”
“What do you want ? ” said the publican, “Eetch
me a piece of hoop-iron,” said the deadbeat, “ so
long ’’—measuring the length with his arm. The
publican brought the hoop-iron to him. The loafer
weighed it, straightened it, felt the edge and
swished it about. “ That’ll do,” he said. “ Wow
bring on your rats ! ”

Galvanic Battery
Is acknowledged by Eminent Physicians, and by
thousands of sufferers to be a positive Remedy for
nearly all the ailments mankind is heir to. The effi-
cacy of this Wonderful Invention as a curative agent
is certainly The Crowning Medical and Scien-
tific Triumph of the 19th Century.'
This BATTERY is not larger than a half-crown
piece, and is worn on the chest, next the skin, suspen-
ded by a silk cord around the neck. The several
metals of which it is composed are so arranged that the
natural humidity of the skin is sufficient to set the chem-
icals in the amalgamated metals in motion, generating
a constant but gentle flow of Electricity which passes
from the Battery into the system, purifying the Blood,
strengthening the Nerves,JBrain and Muscles, infusing
fresh vigor into the Debilitated Constitution, Stimu-
lating the Vital Organs to their proper action and en-
abling nature to throw off numerous diseases.
The Battery will cure the following ailments :—
Headache, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Neuralgia, Ulcers,
and Tumors, Nervous Debility, Impotence, Liver Com-
plaints, Eever and Ague, Disease of the Kidneys and
Urinal Organs, Bronchitus, Asthma, Diphtheria, Fits,
Constipation, Piles, Heart Disease, Paralysis, Disease
Of the Lungs and Throat, Skin and almost
every form of Aches and Pains.
The Battery has a soothing effect upon children
while teething. Illustrated Circular sent free, giving
full particulars and directions for use,
