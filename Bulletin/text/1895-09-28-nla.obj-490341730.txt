GEOFFRY HAMLYN.
Henry Kingsley is fortunate in his pub-
lishers ; or, rather, his fame is. The com-
plete edition of his works now being issued
by Ward, Lock and Bowden is one of the
prettiest series anywhere to be seen.
Marcus Clarke is said to have dubbed
“ Geoffry Hamlyn ” “the begt Australian
novel that has ever been written, or pro-
bably will be written or words to that
effect. The exact authority for the quota-
tion is not given by the quoters, and Clarke
was by no means as good a critic as he was a
writer. Anyhow, if he said such a thing, he
was decidedly wrong.
“ Geoffry Hamlyn ” is not an Australian
novel, but a novel about Australia —a very
different thing. The point of view is Eng-
lish : the characters are all English (Austra-
lians are only introduced as stupid, leggy
youths like the spitting Hawbucks) ; and the
story ends with a triumphal return to Eng-
land where Sam, it is to be hoped, makes a
suitable Shallow, and Alice duly dispenses
; old gowns to the village clothing-club. There
Lj is nothing Australian in the book but the
;i| scenery ; and that, one admits, is lovingly
, I and well described.
No wonder Englishmen admire “Geoffry
Hamlyn,’ which flatters their foibles so
naturally and continually. And “Geoffry
Hamlyn ’ is an excellent romance, with a
perfect right to admiration. But when it is
called “ Australian ” —Australia must protest
. warmly.
, “Geoffry Hamlyn" is a pleasant, ram-
-1 bling story of the old school, patchy in
; i interest, and very patchy , in merit, it is
, ■ never quite dull enough to bore, and rarely
■ j bright enough to excite. You put it down
I without difficulty, and take it up without
! ; anticipation. There is one good “lift”
M when the bushrangers come, and Sam starts
for his ride on Widderin : this gives the same
exaltation as (c. g. ) the death of Porthos,
when “ the giant slept the eternal sleep, in
the sepulchre that God had made to his
measure.”
The pictures of the old-fashioned squatters
of 40 years ago are en joyable ; and the author
has a peculiarly vivid phrase-eloquence that
is very effective. (Note commencement of
chap, xviii., p. 14G ; the bush fire, p, 198;
or the lost child, p. 279—how superior to
Marcus Clarke’s laboured Dickensy version !)
There is no style or the semblance of it:
Kingsley just prattled with his pen as he
would have with his tongue, and the story
comes less from his head than his heart.
He is simple, manly, unaffected ; and
his John Bull prejudices in favour of
“ Grand Seigniors ” and against the
independent Australians (perhaps they
ca. :ij,d them when the convict leaven
leavened the whole lump, 40 years ago ?) are
the natural prejudices of his day and
generation, birth and breeding. They jar
on us. now : bin Kingsley can’t help that.
His work has no particular intellectual
merit, but it will always have a kind of
value as a picture (from one point of view)
of a bygone Australian time. Good old
Tory I Maybe he lived better according to
his lights than we to ours, though we have
(or think we have) the better lights. /

SOME RECENT BOOKS.
Max Pemberton’s The Little Huguenot
(Is. 7d ) is a pretty unsuccessful excursion
into the well-trodden field of French
romance. Luckily the book (like the
Huguenot) is a little one.
On a dull day, with a dull liver, next to
Dumas comes Anstey. His is abuut the
; only bright copy contributed to London
Punch (like flowers at a funeral), and there
is no other English writer who sparkles so
admirably and so consistently. “ Vice
Versa,” “The Pariah,” “A Fallen Idol”
what a delightful concatenation of chuckles !
“Lyre and Lancet,” Mr, Anstey’s latest
(3s. fid.), cannot possibly surpass these, bub
it almost equals them ; and leaves all the
other dialogue-makers (Anthony Hope in-
cluded) ever so many parasangs behind.
“ When Yalmond Came to Pontiac ” (3s. ;
cloth, 45.), Gilbert Parker regards as his
best story. It is ; though none of his long
stories equal his short ones, and Yalmond
himself would have been almost more im-
pressive in, say, 2| Bulletin columns. Yet
“ Yalmond ” is interesting, clever, and good
—a fine imagination (was there a germ 1)
and a good illusion, though the explanatory
pages after 292 are a bad anti-climax,
Yalmond should have died with his friends
around him and a woman on each side his
bed. As for example :
Then Madame Chalice, her handkerchief pressed
to her eyes, shaken by sobs that she made no pre-
tence of concealing, was led to the door by the
avocat. Bub Elise Stooped down again till her
fingers touched Yalmond’s white hands. “They
ran . . . lost Napoleon ” (304-5). Finis.
This would have been an effective close, and
left a permanent picture. The author’s zeal
for explanation spoils his story. One rises
in his fiction-balloon t-> ineffable heights and
is dropped to earth by a facts-parachute,
which breaks, and leaves sensations crushed
and lifeless.
Two recent volumes in Macmillan’s Col.
Library are “ A Martyred Fool,” by D.
Christie Murray, and “By Order of the
Brotherhood ” (3s each ; cloth, 45.). The
former is a good and readable yarn ; the
latter a trash-sample which does this most
indiscriminate of “colonial” collections no
ci'edit.
PERIODICALS.
The coming close of “ The Badminton
Library” series (for want of further material)
naturally suggested a sporting periodical
like “ The Badminton Magazine ” —of which
the first number (Is. 7d.) is just to hand.
That first number is by no means as good as
it ought to be, or as (if critical nuisances will
only have time and patience) the magazine
may yet become. It is too English, too
society, and too recherche. It wants vigor,
interest and breadth—articles something
like the graphic diary of E. A. Fitzgerald
“In the New Zealand Alps,” in August
Contemporary, a vivid extract to show
the pleasures of mountaineering. (Mr.
Fitzgerald and a Swiss guide are making the
ascent of Mount Befton) :
In front of us rose what we had always thought
to be the worst part, looking at it from the Her-
Looking at it from where we were now,
it seemed worse if anything. The rock was
slightly better, but, on the other hand, the loose
pieces were so much larger that we had to re-
double our care. Zurbriggen now crossed over on
to the Copeland side of this bit; it was just
about perpendicular here for about 300 feet, and
we were almost on the crest of the arete, with
some (5000 feet almost sheer drop below us, both
on the Copeland and the Mueher side. There
seemed some peculiarly insecure rooks nere ; some-
times we had to throw them down purposely. We
moved here one at a time with the utmost pre-
caution. I carried the two ice-axes in my hand ;
I found these considerably in my way in climbing.
All of a sudden, as I was coming up one place,
a large boulder that I touched with my right land
gave way with a great crash, falling on my chest.
Zurbriggen was just about to take the ice-axes
from me. I had them in my left hand and was
handing them to him ; the slack rope between us
lay coiled at his feet; the stone as it fell hurled me
down head first. I fell for about eight feet, when
I felt the rope jerk, and I struck against the side
of the mountain with great force. I was afraid
lest I should be .stunned, and drop the two ice-
axes in my hand, for I knew that on these our
lives depended; we should never have succeeded
in getting down the glacier through all the seracs
without them. After the rope had jerked me up,
I Lit it slip and give way, and I came down
slowly for a couple of yards. I thought Zur-
briggen was being wrenched from his position,
and I was just considering how it would feel
dashing down the 0000 feet below us, and how
many times we should strike the rocks on our way
down. _ I saw the rock that I had dislodged going-
down in big bounds; as far as I remember, it
struck the side three times, and then took an
enormous plunge of about 2uoo feet, and landed in
a crevasse in a glacier which has now been named
the Tuckett Glacier. Then I felt the rope stop,
and pull me up short.
I called out to Zurbriggen, and asked him if he
were solidly placed—l was swinging like a pen-
dulum with my back to the mountain, scarcely
touching the rock face. I should have required to
make a great effort to turn round and grasp the
rocks, and I was afraid that the strain which
would necessarily be placed on the rope from this
effort would dislodge Zurbriggen. He thought
that I had been half-killed, as he saw the rock
fall almost on top of me. As a matter of fact, it
struck my chest and glanced off to the right under
my right arm, thus saving me. His first words
were, “Are you very much hurt?” I answered,
“No,” and again I asked him was he firmly
placed? “No,” he said, “I am very badly
situated here. Turn as soon as you can, as I can-
not hold on much longer,” I gave a kick at the
rooks with one foot and managed to swing myself
round. Luckily there was a ledge near me, and I
was able to get some hand-hold almost at once. I
then scrambled up a little way and passed the ice-
axes to Zurbriggen, I held on to these during
the whole manoeuvre. We were in too bad a
place to stop or to speak to one another, so Zur-
briggen climbed up a little further and got him-
self into a firm position; then I scrambled up
after him, and in about ten minutes we had passed
this steep bit.
Here we sat a moment and took a mouthful of
brandy to recover ourselves, for our nerves had
been badly shaken by what had been so nearly a
fatal accident. At the time we did not think so
much of it, as we had to keep our nerve and take
immediate action; but when it was all over, we
felt the effects of it, and we both sat there for
about half an hour before we could move again. I
was considerably hurt by the stone ; it made a cut
in my side which did not heal for a couple of
weeks, and which bled a good deal. However,
we determined to go on and finish the ascent.
I found that Zurbriggen, when I fell, snatched
up the coil broke at his feet. Luckily, he picked
up the right piece in the coil, so that soon ho was
able to bring me nearly to rest, but the strain was
so great upon him, and he was so badly placed,
that he had to let the rope slip through his fingers
to ease his position while he placed himself a little
better. This operation cut all the skin off his
fingers, as the rope heated, slipping through his
hands, and burnt him with the friction. When he
was able finally to stop me, he said that had I
been unable to turn and grasp the rocks he must
have been dragged from his position. He declared
that in all his life he never had been so nearly
killed. Two strands of the rope were cut clean
through by the falling rock.
Now, that is real good stuff, either from an
editor’s or a reader’s point of view ; and the
Badminton wants stuff precisely similar.
Some decent Australian sporting writers
should try and liven it up.
Outing, the American sporting magazine
to which the Badminton will be a rival, has
an interesting August number (Is. Id.), with
two specially good articles on “Polo” and
“ The Yachting Cup Champions of 1896” —
the latter coming very apropos to the recent
races between Defender and Valkyrie 111.,
of which boats admirable pictures are given.
The illustrations in Outing are always re-
markably good.
Chapman's Magazine for August (Is.)
improves on the last number, though the
want of illustrations to some extent tells
against its popularity. But there are three
or four excellent specimens of literature,
and to many readers Chapman’s will appeal
as the most satisfactory of all the magazines.
NOTES.
Arthur Patchett Martin’s fugitive poems
are collected and to be published at last.
They include some uncommonly pretty and
dainty verses, and should reach Australia in
November.
Ethel Turner, like many another, finds
that somebody else has appropriated her
title. Her sequel to “Seven Little Aus-
tralians” was to be “ Growing Up ” ; it will
be “The Family of Misrule.” The book will
arrive about the end of next month ; but
Miss Turner’s short “ Story of a Baby”
should be obtainable rather earlier.
The closing of Remington’s Sydney agency
doesn t look as if so very many Australians
yearn to get into print, after all. Reming-
ton & Co. publish more trash than any other
house in London, and it is generally sup-
posed that the authors pay for their privi-
leges beforehand. Maybe the local genius
doesn’t like this reversion of old-fashioned
beliefs.

OUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
if he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G, JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure. —J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwiok.”

study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

Aggert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of eoufldenoe in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourielvti p UBLIO BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, w-hose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
aooept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
never cease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel f rost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it nas
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain
it has been. Generations passed away have bought irom
the great house, and generations yet to come will do _tne
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents

Why Suffer One Moment
From Torturing Skin Diseases
When a single application of the Cuticura Remedies will, in
the great majority of cases, instantly relieve the most agonizing of
itching, burning, scaly, crusted, pimply, and blotchy skin and scalp
diseases, and point to a permanent and economical (because so
speedy) cure, when the best physicians and all other remedies fail ?
Cuticura Remedies are the
greatest skin cures, blood purifiers,
and humor remedies, are absolutely
pure, and may be used by the
youngest and most delicate with
gratifying and unfailing success.
CUTICURA
the great skin cure, instantly
allays the most intense itching,
burning and inflammation, permits
rest and sleep, speedily heals the CUTICURA TYPES OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY,
skin, and restores the hair. Cuticura Soap, an exquisite skin beau-
tifier, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces. Cuticura
Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin Purifier and greatest of Humor
Remedies, cleanses the blood of all impurities and poisonous ele-
ments, and thus removes the cause. Hence the Cuticura Remedies
cure every disease and humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss
of hair, from infancy to age, from pimples to scrofula.
a®-" All about the Blood, Skin, Scalp, and Hair,” 64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illustra-

We have given the mixture known as “ Miraclum ” a trial on several sets of wheels, etc., and find that it acts as represented. We
are using it on all New Work manufactured by us, being assured it will Prevent Future Shrinkage, and we consider it
invaluable to persons travelling on the road. We have much pleasure in recommending it. COBB & COY.

THE STOCKMAN’S CHEQUE.
There’s a hut in Riverina where a solitary hand
May weaken on himself and all that’s his,
There’s a pub. in Riverina where they keep a
smashing brand
Of every sort of liquor short o’ fizz.
And I’ve been an’ blued another fifty-pounder at
the pub.—
You’re very sorry for me, I’ll be bound !
But when a man is fit up free with hut, an’ horse,
an’ grub,
What the blazes does he want with fifty pound ?
Why the devil should he hoard his fifty quid?
Who would be a bit the better if he did?
Though they slithered in a week,
When I couldn’t see or speak,
Do you think I’m here to squeak?
Lord forbid.
The boss was in the homestead : when he give me
good advice
I took my oath, but took his cheque as well.
And to me the moonlit shanty looked a pocket
paradise,
Though the boss had just been calling it a hell.
Then the shanty-keeper’s daughter, she’s an edu-
cated lass,
And she bangs the new pianner all for me ;
And the shanty-keeper’s wife she sticks me up
as bold as brass,
An’ the shanty-keeper’s wife is good to see.
Two petticoats between ’em whisk you far !
But the shanty-keeper smoked behind the bar.
Oh, his words were grave and few,
And he never looked at you,
But he just uncorked a new
Gallon jar.
We fed, and then we started in the bar at nine
o’clock ;
At twelve we made a move into the cool;
The shanty-keeper he was just as steady as a rock,
And me as paralytic as a fool.
I remember the verandah like a sinkin’ vessel’s
deck,
And a brace of moons suspended in the sky. . .
And nothing more till waking and inquiring for
my cheque,
And the oath of all them three I’d drunk it dryl
So that was all I got for fifty notes !
The three of ’em stood lying in their throats :
There was one that must have seen
I’d have beat him blue an’ green
If I hadn’t gone an’ been
Off my oats.
Thank the Lord I’m back at last—though back
(wrecked and whisky-logged 1
Yet the gates have not come open that I shut,
And I’ve seen no broken fences, and I’ve found
no weak sheep bogged,
An’ my little cat is purring in the hut.
There’s tea, too, for the billy-can, there’s water
in the tanks,
The ration-bags hang heavy all around ;
! An’ my good old bunk an’ blanket beat the bare
verandah planks
Of the shanty where I blued my fifty pound 1
Here I stick until I’m worth fifty more,
When I’ll take another cheque from the store ;
And with Riverina men
All the betting is that then
I shall knock it down again
As before.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s an old tree standing lonely by the river,
Last of all to brave the fates for ever sweeping
Through the storm winds and the forest fires
upleaping,
Last of all the leafy monarohs on the river.
High it towers like the spirit of a Glory,
O’er the waters singing harmonies unknowing
To the fledglings as they listen to the flowing
Weaving music through its softly-murmured story
Here the birds have ever found a welcome bower
At the close of day to rest their weary winging,
And the morn is ushered in by songsters singing
Gladsome litanies unto the dawning hour.
Out to north the burning chariot rolls over
Plains all shadowless through days of fiercest
glowing,
But there’s always here a limpid river flowing,
And the old tree’s shade is timely for the rover.
It has felt the life and death of seasons sundered,
As their whirlwinds swept to meet the final
changing
From the flaming days of summer to the rang-
ing
Of the Storm-Kings when their bright battalions
thundered.
Yet, though Nature’s wrathful demons did not
sever
Bird from restful tree and river-song unending,
It is straight-grained and the fence wants badly
mending,
So to-morrow must it crash farewell for ever.

Yankee Doodle, ” blended Polities.
The above is, of course, a caricature of the famous American national picture, which will be
given later on.
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has ever
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has tins year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE ” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford to
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIXSON & SONS, who use more Amerieon loof

An Economic Problem.
One day recently a deputation waited on
N.S.W. Railway Commissioner Oliver and
asked a question of much larger importance
than it was seemingly aware of. It drew
attention to the fact that the fares on the
Government tramways were somewhat
heavier, in many cases, than those charged
by the omnibuses, and it wanted to know
why the State could not reduce its rates to
the omnibus level 1 In reply to which Mr.
Oliver pointed out that the tramway em-
ployes worked eight hours per diem and
received decent wages— varying, The Bul-
letin believes, between £2 and £3 per week
according to grade while the omnibus
drivers were paid a miserable pittance of 30s.
or 355. a week for 12 or even more hours’
labor. This meant that the wages of the
tramway were double those of the
’bus-driver, and, unless they were cut down
to something like the same level, it was im-
possible to put the two services on a par.
The deputation was apparently staggered by
this simple explanation, and fled in con-
siderable disorder. Next day, as might be
expected, the usual correspondent wrote to
the S.M. Herald demanding to know if the
public was to pay needlessly high fares in
order that the tram-driver or conductor
might receive a vastly higher wage than he
could be obtained for in these hungry times
on free-competition principles, and should
also get a holiday annually, and otherwise be
treated as a white man and not as a nigger
at the public expense. And as nobody
so far appears to have answered this question,
The Bulletin hereby offers a reply on
behalf of the community in general. Said
reply is that, if no other means of economy
can be discovered, the public is to go on pay-
ing the high fares aforementioned for the
exact reason set forth by the Herald’s cor-
respondent, that reason being, in this paper’s
opinion, quite sufficient for all practical pur-
poses.
• * #
Nevertheless, the deputation and the
Herald’s indignant correspondent represent
a very extensive and very unreasonable
sentiment. In Australia a large section of
the working community demands, as a mat-
ter of right, that the eight-hour system
should be established throughout the country,
by law if necessary. So far it has not been
legally established, and the principle is only
recognised in a comparatively small number
of industries ; still, the desire for its establish-
ment is a highly commendable one. The
same section desires to obtain the recognition
of a minimum-wage, which shall enable
every worker to maintain himself in comfort,
and prevent the reproduction in Australia of
the degrading conditions that exist in
Europe. This is also a commendable ambi-
tion. But, in addition to this, a very
large number demand, on Freetrade
principles, that the products of local industry
shall be as cheap here as in Europe, and
that even in industries where wages are
the heaviest outlay, goods produced by men
working at Is. an hour shall cost no more
than goods produced in European factories
by men who are only paid 4d. an hour or
less. And, failing this, they will buy in pre-
ference European goods made on the 4d.-an-
hour plan, and imported under the blessed
conditions of Freetrade. Therefore, when
the eight-hour system and the minimum-
wage and the great Freetrade principle are
applied all together, the natural result will
be the entire shrivelling-up of many Aus-
tralian industries, so that there will be no
work whatever, and no wage, minimum or
otherwise. The Labor man who votes the
Foreign-trade ticket demands that the Aus-
tralian should work for the shortest hours
and the highest wages on earth, and yet
produce as cheaply as the European who
accepts half or a quarter the rate. So
far as concerns the hours and the wages his
theory is admirable, but, in the matter of
cheapness, under present conditions he is
asking the impossible.
* * »
The three recognised taxes on every in-
dustry are rent, interest or profit on capital,
and wages. Also, there is indirectly a fourth
and very serious tax which is not generally
recognised. The cities of Australia, like
those of many other countries, are much too
large for the population, but in Australia
this evil has assumed a more aggravated
shape than in most other lands. And these
cities are enormously overcrowded with
merchants, dealers, clerks, agents, lawyers,
bagmen, sharebrokers, people who do
miscellaneous things on commission, finan-
ciers of innumerable varieties, and hun-
dreds of other kinds of non-producers, all
of whom must needs live somehow on the
producing industries, simply because there is
nothing else—except the temporary influx of
borrowed money—on which they can live. Of
the recognised taxes on productive industry
—-those whose amount can be ascertained
with reasonable accuracy—wages are the
largest in the aggregate, though in some
exceptional instances, such as those of Broken
Hill and Mount Morgan, the amount spent
under this head may be miserably small
compared to the interest on capital. The
unrecognised tax that imposed by the
superfluous city population which does
nothing useful for its daily crust—is prob-
ably the heaviest of all, but its amount can
hardly even be guessed at. If any means
can be found of reducing by one-half or
thereabouts the outlay on rent and interest
and the indirect tax imposed for the support
of the superfluous non-producing population
of Australia’s bloated capitals, then it may
be possible to enforce an eight-hour system
and a respectable minimum wage, and yet
produce so cheaply as to compete with the
underpaid, overworked foreigner upon Free-
trade or moderately Protective conditions.
But unless this reduction is made first, the
eight-hour system and the minimum-wage
only mean a large increase in the cost of
production, and without a heavy protective
tariff to equalise matters Australian indus-
tries must go down like a house of cards.
• # #
The Sydney tramway management pays
reasonable wages, and works its employes
moderate hours, and yet holds its own for
various exceptional reasons. It is an enter-
prise which involves a very small outlay for
rent. The money for construction purposes
was obtained at less than 4 per cent, on a
State guarantee, whereas a private enter-
prise would, in most cases, have to pay con-
siderably more. It is subsidised by the rail-
way department, its shortage being lumped
in with the railway accounts, and further
subsidised by the nation which makes up the
combined shortage of the two departments ;
and it is an undertaking which, by its
nature, is unaffected by foreign competition.
By strict economy and by charging higher
fares than the public approves of, and by
virtue of the other advantages enumerated
above, it is enabled to live on the eight-hour
and minimum-wage principle where a pri-
vate co. would promptly go insolvent. If its
rivals, the omnibuses, were compelled to
pay their employes the same wages and work
them the same hours—in other words,
if the tramways were a protected industry—
the department would doubtless acquire
much more business and would pay hand-
somely. And if the rivals of the Australian
manufacturer or agriculturist—the German,
Italian, Englishman, American, Chinaman,
Japanese, JJand all the rest—could also be
compelled to observe the same laws as to
hours and wages, he also might be able to
prosper without Protection of the Customs
variety. As they can’t be so compelled, the
case for Freetrade, a minimum-wage, and
the compulsory eight-hours, is hopeless
under present conditions.
* # *
With the two exceptions of mining and
wool-growing it is questionable if there is a
single producing industry of any importance
which could hold its own under the condi-
tions suggested. The farmer pays wretched
wages and requires his employes to work
unspeakable hours, yet under Freetrade he
held his own with the utmost difficulty
because his foreign rivals paid much worse
wages and worked as hard, if not harder. If
the eight hour system and the “living wage”
were applied in his case under a Freetrade
policy, the cheap Asiatic would deliver
wheat in all the populous parts of New
South Wales at prices with which he could
not possibly compete. The manufactur-
ing industries which are exposed to foreign
competition would “go broke ’ unanimously.
The wool industry would hold its own so
10. ig as the world’s supply is, as at present,
just about equal to the demand, but if the
supply ever exceeded the demand this
country would be the first to suffer from the
change. If there is ever to be in Australia,
as there certainly ought to be, a universal
eight-hours’ system and a universal wage-
rate, which will enable the people to live
according to a civilised standard, it cannot
be done under the Reid tariff, nor under
the social conditions now existing. With a
heavy and mathematically correct Protective
tariff and the other conditions as they
now are, it would be possible in a
certain limited sense. That is to say,
there would be more employment, higher
wages, higher prices all round as the natural
result of the rise in wages, and a wider
diffusion of what comfort existed. The man
who now earns 10s., a day would then, most
probably, find his income only worth Bs.,
and the man who got the minimum wage of,
say, 6s. 6d. per diem would probably find
his income equal to ss. at present rates.
The difference in his favor would be that he
would get the 6s. 6d. a day, whereas, at pre-
sent, in many instances, he receives nothing
at all. But it must be recognised that it is
impossible to fix a general minimum-wage of
any reasonable amount, or a general eight
or even nine-hour standard without raising
the cost of production, unless the extra cost
can be saved oft' some of the other charges
upon industry. And there is no sense of
justice in fixing a wage or hour standard
unless it is intended to apply ultimately to
the whole community, except in those cases
where no hour-standard is possible. And,
further, to raise the cost of production
means to seriously injure the country’s
export-trade in any case, and—except under
a heavy Protective tariff—to destroy most of
its industries altogether.
» * •
No one has yet devised a really effectual
method of lifting any of the dead-weights off
industry, so that Labor may get a more
reasonable share of the proceeds. Henry
George has stated eloquently the blissful
results to be arrived at by the removal of
the incubus of rent, but, unfortunately, his
scheme only shows the advantages to be
derived when the community has got there,
and the method of getting there without
causing unspeakable disasters en\ route is left
a mystery. No one has yet devised a work-
able scheme to regulate interest—though the
State Land Bank promises to alleviate a
part of the existing evil—nor to prevent the
employer taking an undue share of the
profits. In some instances this cormorant
annexes anything up to 95 per cent, or so of
the net earnings while paying starvation
wages ; in many others, he at present
makes next to nothing, or even less. There-
fore, no general rule or general malediction
applies. And, above all, no one has pro-
posed a satisfactory remedy for the worst
burden of all—the vast multitude of non-
producers, who constitute nearly half the
adult male population, and of whom at least
a third may safely be set down as a super-
fluous burden upon industry. And until
some of these dead weights are removed, any
attempt to enforce a minimum wage or a
fixed standard of working hours, except in
those industries which are not subject to
foreign competition, or except by shutting
out foreign competition altogether, is merely
enacting that a pint-pot shall henceforth be
a quart.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Go on the Land.
It ia an axiom nowadays that every really
right-minded young man should go on the land,
or in some other way become a direct producer
of wealth; and large quantities of serious old
men who never were producers, and never went
on the land, and don’t mean to, keep incul-
cating this lesson with great energy. Never-
theless, the young men of Australia stay off the
land with great success, and the proportion of
clerks, shopkeepers, lawyers, bagmen, parsons,
and every other variety of non-producing urban
population keeps on increasing out of all ratio
to the growth of population. And, as all these
people have to live on the miners, artisans, and
pastoral and agricultural workers, and as the pro-
portion of workers who support them is steadily
diminishing, and as the young man of to-day
won’t go on the land, partly for the very excellent
reason that, somehow or other, the land doesn’t
seem to support him when it is gone on, the
prospects for the future of this country are dis-
tinctly unpromising. In N.S. Wales, at the
census of 1881, the male “ professional classes ”
—solicitors, barristers, clergymen, doctors,
musimans, architects, &c., &c formed less
chan 4| per cent, of the male workers, whereas
in 18!)1 they formed over per cent. The
commercial classes—the clerks, bagmen, book-
keepers, accountants, financial agents, im-
porters, book and insurance fiends, shopkeepers
and miscellaneous hangers-on in and around
offices increased from 15 to 21 per cent, of the
working male population. The artisan class
meanwhile declined from 37 per cent, to 32 per
cent., and the agricultural, mining and pastoral
population fell from 36 per cent, to 35. The
net result is that where there were 73 actual
producers out of every 100 male workers in
1881, ten years later there were oidy 67 ; in
other words, instead of 73 men supporting' 27,
it became a case of 67 men supporting 33. In
Victoria during the same decade the professional
class increased from 19 per 1000 of the total
male population to 22 per 1000. The com-
mercial class increased from 75 to 99 per 1000.
The miners diminished, in proportion to popula-
tion, nearly one-half. The agricultural and
pastoral class fell from 182 to 159 per 1000, and
the only really good feature in the record is
that the artisan class increased from 224 to 291
per 1000—equal to about 40 per cent, of the
adult male population. Still, the total result is
that from 1881 to 1891 the young man kept
going on the land less and less every year, and
that the habit of sitting in an office has been
growing on the community to an alarming ex-
tent. Some day some Australian Government
will awake to a full knowledge of the situation,
and then it will take desperate steps to drive
the young man on to the land by taking him
out there under police supervision, and confis-
cating his pants to prevent him coming back.
The Ikey Mo. Problem.
It seems that the Victorian Supreme Court re-
fuses to recognise a street or right-of-way as a
“place” within the meaning of the Betting
Act, although the English law (when driven
into a corner) interprets the word in its widest
possible sense. Cuthbert’s bill to suppress
wagering in public thoroughfares will meet
this deficiency, which might have been equally
well filled by the obnoxious “insulting-be-
haviour ” clause in the police instructions. To
stand around and take small silver bets from
all and sundry is “insulting behaviour,” if a
myrmidon of the law cares to so call it. Any-
thing is 1.8. in Melbourne, as one or two mem-
bers of the N.S.W. Assembly can testify.
However, the Supreme Court admits a fixed
place, such as a building, a stall, or a
particular stand, to be a place where bet-
ting is illegal, and since the general
public seldom or never bet away from fixed
places, and bookmakers’ clubs are buildings,
the law remains as impudent a humbug as ever,
else would the racing game be promptly
squelched. Cuthbert’s contemptible little Bill
provides that betting in any public place within
100 ft. of a roadway is an offence punishable by
fine or imprisonment. But why within 100 ft.
of a roadway? A “great moral evil” is not
affected one way or other by questions of
locality. The offence is the same whether
committed at Flemington or Little Bourke-
street. is betting illegal in one
place, yet permitted to go on else-
where, with police to control the crowd and
arrest defaulting bookmakers if necessary ?
Why can a detective seize, on his own tobacco-
shop premises, the very same Ikey Mo who gets
a special license from the racing-clubs ? Hoes
Ikey Mo, who is not individually a moral evil,
cease to he a moral evil when he mobs with 100
other Ikeys all laying the odds at once? And,
if so, why ? Let the parsons preach the immor-
ality of betting legislation before turning their
snuffle against the sin of gambling one’s money
in the Tote.
The Government Stroke.
Mr. H. 0. L. Anderson, now head of Sydney
Public Library and formerly N.S.W. Director of
Agriculture, gave the following astonishing tes-
timony before the recent N.S. W. Civil Service
Inquiry Board :
When you were Director of Agriculture did you ever
have people thrust upon you against your will ?—Yes. I
submitted a scheme to the Minister by which the colony
should be divided into four parts, and administered by a
resident inspector in each division. The first division
was the sub tropical one, from the Tweed to the Clarence,
to be in charge of an inspector, who should be an expert
in the cultivation of sugar-cane and other tropical plants.
Secondly, I proposed that there should be a farming dis-
trict in New England, to be in charge of an expert in sheep-
raising, turnip-growing, and English farming, with its
head-quarters at Armidale. The third district was to be the
Western Plains, where wheat and sheep are the specialties
at present. The fourth division was to be the Coast
District, south of the Manning, which should have a
dairy expert to. teach the farmers. I laid this scheme
before the Minister, who said it was an excellent
idea, but that the country could not afford it. He
was willing, however, to start with one inspector. We
thereupon.advertised for an inspector, and got 26 appli-
cations, only one of which was good enough to please the
Minister, who therefore postponed the matter and made
no appointment, nor did he make any provision on the
Estimates then being framed. I never heard anything
more about it. The Minister (Mr. Sydney Smith) went
out Of power in October, 1891, and Mr. Slattery came in.
One day a gentleman came to me and said, “ I want you
to appoint my son-in-law inspector of agriculture. He is
downstairs, in the Stock Department, earning 10s. a day.
He has had great experience down at Fiji.” I said, “ You
must see the Minister. I have nothing to do with it.” I
hinted that the inspector should be a man of good scien-
tific and practical training. He replied, “It is all right,
I will get him appointed.” I said, “ Don’t say that. The
Minister will never do it without consulting me.”
He laughed and said, ‘‘l will have him appointed
in a few days.” Previously to that time no appoin;-
ment had ever been made in the department with-
out my having been first consulted as to the necessity for
the position and the qualification of the candidate. Mr.
Smith never appointed even an office-boy without con-
ferring with me. A few days after this interview five in-
spectors of agriculture were appointed, and another
appointment was made of inspector of agricultural shows,
the last being to fill a vacancy. This man had never seen
an agricultural show in New South Wales.
What salary did the inspectors receive ?—The five new
ones £3OO a year each. I had recommended to the
Minister that they should have graduated salaries, from
£2OO to £3OO.
They were all bracketed at £3OO a year ?—Yes.
And they were not required ?—No, because they were
not agricultural experts; I could not find work for them.
Then men were appointed in the Public Service who
were not required?—Certainly. If they had been.good
men they would have been very valuable, and would have
done most necessary work. I could have done magnificent
work for the colony with highly-trained practical men,
men trained in an agricultural college, with expert know-
ledge in their respective lints. But the five men were all
appointed on the recommendation of political friends—
alw'ays irresponsible, and often incompetent to judge of
the candidate's qualifications. I had picked out the
eight candidates with the best testimonials, and expected


a rigid examination of these candidates and their records
before even one should be appointed on probation.
Are these men in the department now?—One is. The
Minister who prepared the Estimates only provided tor
one.
Are they still in the service?—l do not know if all are.
I can give the history of one who is ; he charged travel-
ling expenses of 12s. a day on an occasion when I saw him
in town. 1 asked him to explain how it was that he was
charging for travelling expenses when he had not left
Sydney. He said he had been out of town, and gave me
full details of his proceedings on the day in question. I
told him to look at his diary. He afterwards confessed
that he was not travelling that night on departmental
business, and it transpired that he stayed behind a day,
sent in a false return to show that hg was in the country,
falsified his diary, and charged his travelling expenses. I
reported him. I said he ought not' to remain in our ser-
vice. He gave as an explanation that it was an oversight,
and it was accepted. He repeated this serious offence
within a few weeks, and was then admonished—nothing
more. All this can be proved from the papers. He was
reported afterwards for drunkenness in my office. Wit-
nesses were not even asked for evidence. His explanation
was deemed satisfactory. •
Is he still in the service?—Yes. He was retrenched
from the Department of Agriculture, and soon afterwards
appointed to another posHion.
You spoke of a gentleman who* asked you to appoint
his son-in-law inspector ?-»He was not a trained expert in
agriculture; but he was a gentleman. I had no trouble
with him at all. He did his routine work very satis-
factorily, and improved very much in usefulness.
Did he know his business?—He was not an expert.
Another of the men appointed celebrated his first day in
the civil service by getting drunk, and he came to my
office in that slate, his Excuse b|tftg that he had been
travelling all night. I told him’jfo go and get sober,
which he did. He caiaae hack afterwards fairly sober.
He was a very- intelligent man, and I sent him up the
country to represent the department, and visit the farmers
to instruct them. He was reported as drunk there. I
went into the country to investigate the case, and found
he had been beastly drunk for two weeks, and had done
no work. I reported him, and recommended that he hi
dismissed. He was allowed to continue for two weeks
longer, and draw his salary all the time, when he resigned.
He was nob censured, but I was for suspending a drunken
man from duty.
Daring the time you were in the Agricultural Depart-
ment were there many other cases of persons being put in
your department against i our will, or were the ones you
mentioned the only cases that occurred ?—There were
many other cases.
Mr. Slattery, who gives a general denial to
Mr. Anderson’s statements so far as they affect
himself, states that he has asked Premier Reid
to have a special Parliamentary committee
appointed to elicit the facts.
The Bogan Bridge at Monkey-
Some More.
Premier Reid’s new Loan Bill only differs from
theold one rejected by N.S. VV. Leg. Council inso-
mubh as it is an even more impudent fraud on
posterity than its predecessor. A smaller pro-
portion of it goes into works calculated to yield
revenue, and a larger percentage into small
jobs of everyday occurrence, which can give no
return, and which no honest Legislature could
charge to posterity, for the reason that posterity
will have similar liabilities of its own to meet
as long as the country lasts. Therefore, the
proposal to leave posterity to pay its own
bills and those of its fathers as well is
a mean device to avoid facing to - day’s
responsibilities. Among the more conspicuous
of these frauds upon the coming Australian,
£lO,OOO is to be spent in repurchasing lands
which were lately sold and the proceeds put
into revenue ; they will probably be sold again
and the proceeds put into revenue a second
time, so that the next generation will lose the
land and also have to pay for it. The famous
vote for “thinning out forests” has been in-
creased from £25,000 to £50,000. There is
£96,000 for building sundry bridges, including
the Bogan bridge at Monkey, which will be
worn-out long before the people are done pay-
ing the cost of them, and for patching old
bridges, and wood - blocking Enmore - road,
Sydney. The same old items for dredging
rivers, which will have to be dredged over and
over again so long as they keep on rim-
ing, are to come out of the borrowed funds
and are cheerfully classed as “permanent and
reproductive works !” despite the obvious fact
that they are neither permanent nor reproduc-
tive ; and the sums for patching old dredges,
repairing wharves, repairing public buildings,
clearing lands where the bush will grow again
before the second year’s interest falls due, buy-
ing stores, and making the Mosman’s Bay drain
are also in the list as formerly. The total
amount of the new borrowings is now set down
at £1,555,000, and of this £1,100,000 is for jobs
which should no more be charged to loans than
should Treasurer Reid’s official salary or bar-
ber’s bill, inasmuch as they will produce no re-
venue, and instead of being permanent as alleged
they are works of a kind which turn up every
year and will keep turning up every year for
centuries. Still the measure, so far as the
Assembly is concerned, has progressed with
very little opposition. Mr. Reid’s attitude in
the matter is simple and pathetic. If the Loan
Bill is passed he will find work for the unem-
ployed out of the proceeds. If it is not passed
he won’t raise the required amount by earnest
retrenchment, as could easily be done, and start
the proposed works without the loan, but he
will point to those who voted against his un-
principled finance as bowelless despots who
have no compassion on the poor. Therefore,
the poor will either eject them at next election,
or throw bricks at them, or both. Under
these circumstances the Loan Bill will pro-
bably pass, though The Bulletin, despite
its sympathy with the unemployed, trusts that
even at this late hour some disaster may happen
to it. The kind of compassion which consists
m helping the people of to-day, whose votes
keep G. H. Reid in office, by bringing down
worse disaster on those of to-morrow, whose
votes won’t be of any value to G. H. Reid, is
an emotion to be regarded with doubt. New
South Wales can and should pay for all its
current repairs out of revenub, and thereby find
employment and do much useful work for the
country, and if its Government won’t do this,
then it is time it got another Government which
will.
Economic Drivel.
Sydney Telegraph
We cannot bar imports without, to the same extent,
barring exports. The countries which buy our products
nave nothing to pay lor them with but products of their
own. According as we tax the bringing ih of those pro-
ducts, therefore, we tax the sending out of ours for
which they are sent here in payment. It is only a Free-
trade Government, therefore, that can consistently assist
m the development of an export industry.
Wherefore this paper rises to ask a question :
if the cou”tries which buy our products must
pay for them witli products of their own, and
a country will only buy our exports if we buy
its goods in return, how comes it that New
South Wales annually sells £1,100,000 worth of
goods to Belgium though it only buys £129,000
worth in return ? Also, how is it that Chili buys
from N.S. W. £120,000 worth of goods, though
New South Wales buys nothing in return ; and
France buys from New South Wales 23 times
as much as it sells to that province; Germany
three times as much as it sells ; German New
Guinea about 2500 times as much ; Hawaii 40
times as much ; Italy three times as much ;
while New South Wales buys from Ceylon 35
times as much as Ceylon buys from it? In
short, how is it that in no single case is the
balance of trade equal? The whole business
consists in buying from countries that don’t buy
in return, or selling to countries which don’t
sell in return, and yet the Telegraph keeps
repeating the old, old shibboleth that if we
don’t buy German beer and iron and shoddy, Ger-
many won’t buy our wool, and so on ad infinitum.
The simple and obvious answer is that other
countries will buy our goods if they need them,
and that the German who buys our wool in
London probably doesn’t even know whether
we admit German iron and beer or not, and
wouldn’t care a straw if he did know, and isn’t
sufficiently interested to inquire. When the
Telegraph bought its American type-setting
machines from a country which shuts down all
it can on New South Wales exports, it gave
the lie flat to its own theory. It bought the
machines because it wanted them, and even if
the States had admitted all Australia’s pro-
ducts free for ever and ever, it wouldn’t have
bought them if it hadn’t wanted them. The
theory that countries only take goods from
countries which buy in return, and that Pro-
tection is fatal to exports, and that only a
Freetrade Government can consistently foster
an export trade, is a pitiable variety of rot.
Does anyone, when he buys a German pipe,
first hunt up the tariff to see if Germany takes
frozen meat from this country or not ?
“ Outis,” of Sydney Telegraph, gets on to the
horrors of Protection once more :—-
There were recently submitted to the Vic. Government
tenders tor the supply of a large quantity of Gippsland
coal, and some disgust was expressed in good Protectionist
circles because Govt, did not at once close with the offers
made. The quantity of coal tendered for was 156,000
tons, and the Gippsland pit-owners offered among them
to supply this at a price averaging 16s. per ton, or 4s.
more than the best Newcastle coal, warranted to burn and
produce heat. The difference in cost to the Govt, is esti-
mated at not less than £19,000, and probably as much as
£30,000. It would pay the Vic. taxpayers just as well to
subsidise, say, 200 men at the rate of £2 a week for their
own personal benefit, and without consideration in return.
The facts of the case, as fully reported in the
Melbourne papers, are rather different. The
Vic. coal was offered at 11s. 7d. per ton, the
alleged 16s. being one of the elaborate fictions
by which the Telegraph keeps up the story
about the horrors of Protection. As Victorian
coal is sold retail in Melbourne at 12s. 6d. per
ton, the idea of the owners demanding 16s.
wholesale is unique. And the statement that
Newcastle coal could be supplied for £30,000 a
year less is another invention ; what was
stated was that the Vic. coal cost £30,000 less
to get out of the pits than the owners demanded
from the Government; also that the required
amount of Newcastle coal could be bought for
£40,000 per annum less at Newcastle — no allow-
ance being made for freight and other charges.
The beautiful mixture which “Outis” produces
out of these facts may not be lying, but it looks
like a bad case of jim-jams.
Extract from the N.S.W. gaol regulations
lately issued by Minister Gould :
Clause 22. Prisoners shall, when practicable, bathe
once a week. They shall wash each morning and (if
there be no means of bathing) their feet on Saturday.
Apparently, therefore, there are prisons in
N.S.W. where there are no recognised means
of bathing, and as no provision is made for the
coufinee “ cleaning himself ” with a bucket of
water and a rag, he may remain unwashed—
except as regards his feet—until the end of his
term. Therefore, The Bulletin suggests that
the form of sentence should be altered to fit the
case. “Prisoner, you are hereby sentenced to
be imprisoned and to remain dirty, except,
perhaps, as regards your feet, for 12
calendar months,” would be expressive. Also,
it would be explicit, which the present form
isn’t, as it says nothing at all about the prisoner
remaining dirty.
In the British Medical Journal of August 3,
1895 (page 285), is reported Sir William
Priestly’s opening address at the annual meet-
ing of the British Medical Association. An
extract: —
There .are always discontented women who magnify
their sufferings, and some neurotic patients will submit
to any martyrdom for the sake of evoking sympathy. As
an extreme example of what neurotic women will endure
and even crave for in the way of operation, I may mention
the case of a woman who suffered several successive
amputations, beginning with the finger and ending with
the removal of the shoulder-joint, for injuries which were
self-inflicted.
In view of recent Australian events, this ex-
tract is most suggestive. Again :
The Melb. police have abandoned the case of alleged
outrage on the girl Daisy Watson at Albert Park. The
girl informed the police that she thought the man’s name
was Burns, but on Burns being arrested and brought
before her, the girl said that she did not think Burns
was the man, and refused to take any further action.
Ed. Bulletin, —“Medicus,” in a recent issue,
draws attention to a matter that will require
further ventilation if the generous support
hitherto accorded to Sydney’s hospitals is to be
upheld. Any tiling like sectarian or racial
monopoly in organisation and management must
tend to alienate that broad public sympathy
with them which should exist, and, however we
may admire the desired success by Scotchmen,
no one wishes to see all other claims and quali-
fications passed over in the interest of Scotia’s
clannishness. Surely, if any such claim of birth
should operate, the claim of the native-born
might be advanced against the world. The last
three practitioners appointed to Sydney Hospital
are all Scotchmen, with Scotch qualifications.
Again there is a vacancy, and of the present
applicants two are Australian—one an M. D. of
London and one an M.B. of Edinburgh, while a
third is a Scotchman who has practised in Syd-
ney for a shorter period than either of the
other applicants ; yet the appointment may
almost be considered “cut and dried ” for this
gentleman, against whom nothing can be said,
but in favor of whom nationality is the main
consideration. The Alfred Hospital exhibits a
striking contrast to this spirit, for there men
with Australian diplomas (other things being
equal) are preferred to outsiders.— Patria.
At Prahran (Vic.) Court the other day a
marine-stores collector was brought up to show
cause why his license should not be cancelled,
on the ground that he had been convicted of
larceny in 1879 ! It was not shown that the
police intervention in this instance was due to
any offence recently committed by defendant,
nor was it shown that at any time during the
period from ’79 to ’95 the man had led other
than an honest life. Indeed, the police were
fain to admit, obviously with reluctance, that
his manner of earning a livelihood was perfectly
reputable, and equally that ‘ no suspicion
attached to the man himself other than that
engendered possibly by the fact that he had been
convicted for a petty theft 16 years ago. More-
over, it transpired that the offence in question
consisted in his having stolen a pair of boots,
his defence at t he time being that, while drunk,
he was given the boots to pawn by a com-
panion, and that he did not know they were
stolen. The Bench, after solemnly digesting
these facts, adjourned the case for a fortnight,
“to allow further inquiries to be made”—
which doubtless means that the representatives
of Law-’n’-Order are “tipped the wink” to
diligently rake over the dust-heap of 16 years
to find some more recent and convincing
iniquity perpetrated by the hapless man. Mean-
while the object of these gallant proceedings
spends a joyous interval of suspense with the
prospect of losing his license at the end of it.
In this case of the insignificant dealer, be
the previous circumstances what they may, the
police show up to advantage—as usual.
A suspicious circumstance in the Victorian
Closed Roads (politely called unused roads)
debate was the eagerness of the squatters to
pay rent for roads of which for years they have
had free use. There is a statutory obligation
on squatters to fence off these roads, but their
domination of the local Councils and the supine-
ness of Parliament has given them a free lease-
hold of lands that at a moderate rental would
bring in <£26,000 a year. Longmore made a
picturesque attack on the proposal for leasing.
He cited a Government road in Camperdown
shire closed by the occupant squatter with
stone walls, necessitating a d6tour of 20
miles to every man travelling from Derri-
nallum to Camperdown. For 20 years the
residents suffered under the grievance. The
grey old Radical quoted with gusto his one-
time leader’s opinion : “ Higinbotham said in
his hearing in that House that if once the roads
were allowed to get into the hands of the great
proprietors by any authority whatever, the
country would never have the roads again.”
First there had been swing-gates, and now it
was proposed to close the roads. The next step
would be the purchase of the roads, and, after
that, they could never be reclaimed. Longmore
had a drastic remedy for the grievance. The
squatters had already made a million out of the
roads. Their statutory obligation to fence
them would entail an expenditure of a million.
The maddest wag of the rain - beseeching
controversy has turned up in the man who
wails, in Sydney Daily Telegraph, over
the profanity of the astronomer who —in
view of the “facts” that the sun stood still
for Joshua, and “went back ten steps” for
the edification of Hezekiah —omits to append
“ D. V.” to the prediction of an eclipse, and of
the meteorologist who dares to prophesy mois-
ture without explaining at the same time that
it will probably be withheld “ through God’s
anger at the wickedness of the people.” But
meteorologists don’t “prophesy;” they only
“ forecast,” and “ even the astronomer,” says
Huxley, “ claims no more for the assumption
that the sun will rise to-morrow than a very
high degree of probability.” Science, with all
her wealth of corroboration, has never yet
ventured upon the absolute certainty so in-
solently arrogated by theology—with no corro-
boration whatever !
What the Sulphide Problem Is.
The 88 million ounces of silver and 380,000
tons of lead, which the Broken Hill mines have
produced, have been derived almost entirely
from oxidised ores. These ores, which for the
greater part can be simply smelted, are now
practically exhausted, except in the Central,
British, and B.H. Proprietary mines. The
supply in the Central is uncertain, and in the
British very small; and in the B.H. Proprie-
tary, which is infinitely the best off, it is esti-
mated that not more than two years’ supply
remains.
# * *
Underlying the oxidised ores, and extending
to unknown depths, is sulphide ore. Its extent
is uncertain, but enormous. It occurs in vast
bodies —has been found at a depth of 100 ft.,
and still exists at the lowest level reached,
1250 ft. This ore consists of sulphide of zinc,
commonly called blende; sulphide of silver;
and a silicions matrix of gangue. Both the
zinc and the lead particles carry silver. Hun-
dreds of thousands of tons of it average 25 per
cent, lead, 22 per cent, zinc, and from 7 to 45
oz, silver. The gross value of the metallic
contents per ton averages higher than that of
the oxidised ores, at least so far as the upper-
level sulphides are concerned. The aggregate
value of the metals in the ore is many tens of
millions. The problem of their extraction, if it
be a problem, is therefore of national impor-
tance.
# « #
The ore cannot be smelted in the ordinary
way on account of the high percentage of zinc.
Zinc flies into vapor rapidly, and chills rapidly.
Hence it chokes up the furnace if there is more
than (i per cent, present in the charge.
# # •
The ore cannot be smelted for zinc. Zinc
smelting is a distilling process. The ore,
powdered, is put into smaller retorts with coal
or coke-dust, and tiie vapor is collected. Any
silver and lead (or the greater part of it) is left
in the bottom, and this residue can be smelted.
But the retorts are necessarily made of some
silicions compound, and if there is much lead
present it eats out the silica, destroys the
retort, impedes the progress of distillation, and
spoils the zinc.
M * «
The ore cannot be effectively dealt with by
mechanical means—by jigging or concentration,
that is. The trouble lies in, first, the fineness
of the particles and the intimacy of their
association, and, then, in the fact that both
lead and zinc particles are silver-bearing. To
completely separate the zinc from the lead
would mean such fine crushing as to “ flour ”
or “slime” almost the lot. Water action on
slimes is in almost all circumstances ineffective.
# # #
In the laboratory it is easy with any one of
several acid solutions to leach out the zinc,
leaving only the silver and lead in the ore,
especially after a roasting. Dr. Schnabel sug-
gested sulphurous and sulphuric acids. They,
like the others that have been suggested, were
found too expensive. Treatment by any of
these is called a humid or chemical process.
# # #
To save acid and to assist in the deposition
of the zinc, which the acid solution has taken
up, electricity has been employed. The direct
electrical deposition of the zinc has also been
attempted. The obstacle is that the zinc ore is
a wretchedly poor conductor; the action is,
therefore, very slow, and cost correspondingly
heavy. Mr. Ashcroft’s process is an electrical
one ; it has yet to be tried on a commercial
scale. This is the electrolytic method. The
humid method, with electrolytic help, is the
ideal; the mechanical is the practical. Tired
of waiting for somebody to reach the ideal, the
directors of several companies have made a
beginning with the practical. They have,
therefore, adopted the admittedly imperfect
mechanical method. They do not get every-
thing out, and never will. They do get enough
to make it pay.
• * #
Concentration is based on the fact that the
specific gravity of zinc blende is 4, and of this
lead about 7‘5. The raw ore is first broken in
machines, then ground, then the particles are
separated by jigging, hydraulic classification,
&c. The object is to eliminate the zinc so that
what is left may be smelted. As it is impos-
sible to make a complete separation without
great loss in slimes, the ore is not ground very
fine. Some zinc is thus retained : the concen-
trates show from 6 to 13 per cent.
* # #
Concentrates that contain more than about 6
per cent, zinc, if not blended with ores heavy in
lead before smelting, must be prepared by a
desulphurising and chlorodising roasting. This
is done at Block 14, under Mr. Greenway’s
management.
# • •
Generally, then, the lower the percentage of
zinc the greater the quantity of “ fines,”
“ slimes,” or “zinc concentrates ” —all one and
the same thing. As they are generally rich in
silver, it pays to blend the best of them with
lead ores, making a smelting compound. But
heavy deductions are made on account of their
zinc contents.
* # •
It is considered a good concentration which
results in the saving of 70 per cent, of the lead
and 55 per cent, of the silver. As all the zinc
is lost, and as zinc is valued at <£ls per ton,
silver at 2s. 7d. per oz., and lead at .£lO ss. per
ton, it follows that nearly two-thirds in value
of the metal is not recovered. As this two-
thirds is the tailings, which contain, say, two-
thirds of the zinc that was originally in the ore
and only, say, one-fourth of the lead, it is pos-
sible that these tailings may yet be worked
primarily for zinc. But no process yet laid
before the public will allow of its being done.
* # *
The zinc market is very uncertain. It is
controlled by a Continental “ ring,” which is
very jealous of outside production. Steady
improvements have been made in the mechani-
cal process by the addition of buddies, keeves,
hydraulic classifiers, &c., and by special arrange-
ments of jigs. These permit of the treatment
of the slimes, and the consequent fine crushing
of the ore. This improvement is the most
hopeful feature of the whole business.

Quite a gloom has been cast over S. A.

The rural chap will miss him when he starts to
make things hum,
After days of good bush whisky or of strong new

He will miss old Tantanoola from his once familiar
lair,
As he shapes his course for homewards after hours
of thoughtful pray’r.
He will miss the zest of telling to the gaping.

How he saw the blessed tiger as he crossed the

How he marked his vivid striping, and the color
of his eyes,
And took especial notice of his prehistoric size.
Yes, he’ll miss old Tantanoola when he’s out upon
a “ bust,"
And some passing neighbor finds him writhing
madly in the dust.

end, ,v>.
And to time-worn snakes and devils must he once

Mark Twain is one of the very few im-
ported celebrities who can bear inspection— rea-
sonably near inspection, that is. He is a white-
haired, shaggy person, who presents a close and,
perhaps, intentional resemblance to his portrait
as it appeared recently in The Bulletin. His
head is like an amazed gum-tree, and his mane
sticks out in all directions, and gives him the wild
expression of a man who has just found a baby’s
shoe in the soup. Yet he is a very placid
humorist, all the same. He speaks slowly and
lazily, with a break between his sentences, so that
he can listen to Smythe counting the takings in
the back-room as he goes along. Also, he trots up
and down at times with a curious trot, but most
of the time he stands quite still in front of his
audience and muses aloud. There is practically
nothing new in his discourse. All Ids stories are
taken from his own old books, and, though he tells
them in a wildly comic fashion, their age is a con-
siderable drawback. Also, the extreme gradual-
ness of the speaker makes each story last a long
time; the inspiriting anecdote about a corpse,
which commenced the proceedings on the first
night, lasted 15min., and in the Australian
climate, where the deceased doesn’t keep for any
considerable period, this prolonged exposure was
unwise. Moreover, the Australian likes his
corpse fresh. Still, it was a most interesting
corpse, and Mark Twain must be set down
as a decided success. On his first night
six lank, soulful-looking people left early,
one of them, who evidently viewed Mark as a
frivolous person, saying that he “ couldn’t stand
this rot.” The rest of the audience remained and
applauded tremendously. One enthusiast even
stated audibly that he would have given 20 guineas
only to see the author of the “ Jumping Frog,”
and his friend said he would have given thirty,
though whether they wanted to see all of him for
the money, or only his head and his dress-suit,
didn’t appear. Anyhow, The Bulletin is of
opinion that M. Twain could make a considerable
sum by giving private back views of himself in his
shower-bath at a guinea a head. He wears a
cleaner collar than Talrnage, and lacks the funereal
aspect of most humorists this paper has known,
and, all things considered, he doesn’t look like a
man who deserved to have Parkes’s oratory let
loose upon him at a heavy dinner in a strange
land. The people who set up Parkes to talk at
Mark Twain had a wide knowledge of the unfit-
ness of things in general.

The Opera co. began its season at Sydney
Lyceum with the ever - welcome “Ma Mie
Rosette,” which went gaily and joyously from the
first line to the last. The change in the cast
hasn’t caused any serious damage. The fair May
Pollard puts rather more clothes on to her art-
less village maiden than her predecessor used to
do, though there is absolutely no reason, judging
from what of Miss Pollard still remains visible,
why this should be so. Her melodious voice is in
excellent condition, and when she states in verse
that she was dreaming she does it just as effec-
tively as even the departed Nellie, Also, she
throws her whole great soul into the part, and
when Miss Pollard throws her soul in real earnest
it generally hits something. Altogether the new
Rosette is a girl from whom anybody might be
proud to receive milk at a late hour, either in a
chateau or elsewhere, and why she has not
hitherto occupied a more prominent position on
the Firm’s bills is a mystery. Wallace Brownlow
has added some new touches to his picture of the
king, and there is a deeper villainy in his muffled
voice as he tells Tapley to start at once for the
seat of war, and leave him to be a father to his
best girl in his absence. Lauri, Joseph Tapley,
Misses Flo. Young and Marietta Nash admirably
fill their old parts, and Howard Vernon’s colonel
seems to have lost several more ears since he last
appeared in Sydney. “Madame Angot,” with
Miss Juliet Wray as Clairette, is announced to
make an intermittent appearance on Tuesday and
the two succeeding nights, too late for notice in
this issue. Then there is to be another fleeting
appearance of “Rosette,” and the “Old Guard ”
follows on Saturday.
** * *
George Rignold did his last night at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) on Saturday, and the big
theatre is now closed, pending the appearance of
the Woods-Marshall Co. on Saturday of next
week. “Clancarty” did a one-night revival on
this occasion, and- went remarkably well in the
presence of a large audience. Its best features
were the fine acting of Sterling Whyte as William
111., and Miss Maud Williamson’s excellent,
though at times rather shriekful, rendering of
Lady Clancarty. At a convenient interval,
Trickett, M.L.C., made his appearance with a
vast quantity of notes, and made a few long, sad,
slow observations, in the course of which he
remarked six times that Geo. Rignold was now
about to take his departure. The dreadful
protractedness of Trickett, and the manner
in which he wandered round himself in
circles, and lost himself at times, and fell
over himself at other times when his feet got
entangled in the' end of a sentence, became a
heavy burden after a while. But finally he
emerged sufficiently from his vocabulary to pre-
sent the retiring lessee with a silver tea and coffee
service, and then he departed with both hands
full of large adjectives, and Mr. Rignold replied
in a bright, effective speech, and had flowers
thrown at him. Also, Mrs. Rignold appeared in
response to a great public demand, and after that
—Trickett having presumably been removed from
the premises—the drama went on. G.R. is going
to do a season of “Joseph of Canaan” in Mel-
bourne, and when Joseph’s twelve red, scowling
brethren have settled in Egypt for the last time
he will take his departure for Europe.
** * *
On Saturday next the Dacres begin a
farewell season at Sydney Cri. with that bright
comedy, “ A Scrap of Paper.” These very clever
artists deserve much better fortune than they have
yet met. in Australia, and if the “Scrap ”is any-
thing like what it was at its last appearance it
should fill the Criterion to the dome. Acting-
Gov. Darley an jsuite are to adorn the show on
the opening night,
** * %
“My Sweetheart,” at Sydney Royal, is
much the same mild disappointment as it was
last week. The company does its work better as
time goes on, but the awfulness of the improve-
ments which some unauthorised person has been
making in the comedy assert themselves like the
horrid dream of Richard 111. Still the general
result may be charitably set down as no worse
than it was.
** * *
Prof. Kennedy still pursues the objection-
able tenor of his marvellonsly-prosperous way at
Sydney School of Arts. The two variety theatres
also prosper as aforetime, and, so far as present
appearances go, there is so little to choose between
them that the writer would take a benefit at
either house indifferently.
** * *
The short-haired child with the heavenly
expression depicted on page 11 is Dudley Wyatt,
the Calculating Boy, whose astonishing logarithms
created a sensation at Sydney Empire. Dudley
is fully as young as he looks, his probable age
being about seven. Whether he really calculates,
or whether figures simply grow on him as d : rt
does on the common or back-yard infant, the
present writer doesn’t pretend to know. Any-
how, young Dudley always seems to get there,
and his calculations are presumably correct,
though the sums which he does in a few seconds
are so vast that no one else can check the calcula-
tion and get the answer out before the theatre
closes for the night. Still, one or two enthusiasts
have sat up all night to verify his figures, and
after finishing the calculation have broken down
beneath the mental strain and could never remem-
ber what the result came to. There is no known
recipe for making a calculating boy ; young Wyatt
simply grew and made the life of the house cat a
misery, and fell downstairs like other infants, and
then suddenly developed his gift and became
what he is.
** * *
The last night of the Gaiety girls at the
Lyceum was a tremendous occasion. The pro-
gramme consisted of sections from “In Town ”
“Gentleman Joe,” and the “Gaiety Girl,” but
that was the smallest part of the night’s doings.
The lower part of the house was enthusiastic ; the
accumulated johnnydom in the circle was appre-
ciative, though recent reductions in its salary
somewhat mitigated its fervour; and the gallery
boiled over incessantly, and threw little bunchesof
flowers, and shrieked forth its farewell till its
voice gave out, and heaved like a troubled sea of
hats and meat and vegetation. Of the ladies,
Grace Palotta, Decima Moore and Madge Rosseli
were evidently thefavorites, and these charmers got
away at last with the stentorian howl of the gods
still ringing in their ears. The gods simply
emptied themselves of all the howl that was in
them at the trio, and it will be a month before
they accumulate enough to disturb a prayer-
meeting with. The receptions accorded to Kaye
and Bradfield were something to remember.
The latest of the airy nothings confided to
the George Edwardes co.’s care was produced at
Melb. Princess’s on Saturday. Its character,
which is rather less airy and somewhat more
nothing than “In Town,” has been recently dis-
cussed by The Bulletin. Al 2 nights’ run ought
to meet all demands. Louis Brad field and his
colleagues are playing “ Gentleman Joe ” without
the advantage of knowing exactly how the trick
is done by Arthur Roberts—a circumstance of
much importance to the case, probably. Any-
how, this musical comedy doesn’t display Brad-
field and the others at their best in any one instance.
People vyho have seen them all do something
better will derive comparatively little joy from
“Gentleman Joe,” whereas new patrons will take
the bright visions as they come and find no fault
with them. The chief defect in “ Gentleman
Joe ” seems to be an entire lack of satirical pur-
pose. Sundry daughters are introduced with a
first appearance of having an end in view, but
they wander aimlessly around without getting the
least bit forarder. Nobody strikes up an original
flirtation. The girls who want millionaires at the
start are just as hopelessly in need of those handy
articles at the finish. Also, Miss Decima Moore’s
voice is several sizes smaller than of yore, and
Miss Palotta’s accent is a drawback instead of the
valuable item it ought to be, and the pas de trois
is injuriously affected by linen pants cut level
with the knee, and charming Florence Lloyd is
too big for her buttons. Yet, after all has been
said, the fact remains that the Gaiety Girl Co. is
a stylish organisation under any conditions. An
unclescribed something lends a special thingummy
to the show, or seems to, which is precisely the
same thing.
** * *
Outside of the Princess’s nothing is hap-
pening in Melbourne to-day (Thursday) with the
exception of two ’alls. They are taking place as
usual in an ordinary manner. At the Opera
House, where a necessary guard has been set upon
the wildly-improper joke which loves to sneak
into a variety entertainment in search
of gallery larfs, little Alina Grey and the
fresh young Banvard acrobats are strong
points of a stupendous programme. The
Cambridge show still asserts a just claim to exist-
ence, and its symptoms of increasing vitality
furnish gratifying proof that enterprise and —in
short, the Cambridge begins to make itself felt.
The trouble with all new shows of the kind is to
get a firm grip of the world’s understanding and
make themselves felt.

On Friday, the Bijou opens for a short
season of Bret Harte —no, Mark Twain.

Quite apart from Smythe’s cut into the
cake, Kruse’s concerts gave the least possible en-
couragement to the musical profession. In Mel-
bourne, the unpaid Marshall Hall and his friend,
Mdme. Wiedermann, the honorary vocalist, figured
as valuable items on the till. When the violinist
went to Bailarat he was supported by a paid
singer, Miss Maud Reid, who gave full satisfaction
for her fee. Bub, when it came to the Sydney
trip, Mdme. Wiedermann volunteered to go gratis
in Miss Reid’s stead, whereupon Marshall Hall
granted his colleague leave of absence from duty
at his Conservatorium, and the sassiety lady went.
Which was annoying for her singing pupils,
although highly satisfactory to Smythe, seeing
that he saved a salary by the arrangement.

Tommy Hudson was anxious to get Ada
Colley for his India tour, but the soprano stipu-
lated for the companionship of one or two female
relatives, and Hudson declined to throw the extra
passage-moneys into the bargain. This was un-
wise, to The Bulletin’s way of thinking. A
sweet young singer travelling with a close escort
would have given a glamor to the show,
** * *
A rather nauseous joke is the father
(genuine or “ professional ”) of the youthful acro-
bat who dives from a dizzy height into a net. The
netting is there, invitingly spread for the boy
whenever he likes to let himself drop. The job is
entirely his own—the most personal matter in the
world. Bub the irresponsible parent obtrudes
himself upon the transaction by gazing up to the
roof and shouting, “Are you ready, ’Dolphus?”
When the boy has answered that he is ready, the
parent cries “ Go ! ” with an important expression
of countenance, and in such a fateful tone that he
scoops about tiO per cent, of the glory attaching to
the dive. The audience get a confused idea that
this adult magnate has a genius for discovering
the exact moment when he ought to give the
word. Also, he is supposed to be a splendid
judge of distance, and a few other details which
haven’t the least bearing'on the boy’s performance.
“ Are you ready, ’Dolphus?” It’s an impressive
gag.

“ It; ia now said,” writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent, “that there is no room in
London at present for Nellie Stewart. We shall
see. By-and-by D’Oyley Carte will be in harness
again. But Nellie’s caprice the last time she was
here has not been forgotten.”
Half Melbourne, on Saturday night,
Made tracks for the “Gaiety” show :
Excited, elated,
The city awaited
The advent'of “ Gentleman Joe.”
Smart girls, in the circle polite,
Attended by soft-headed beaux,
Gave over their flirting
The moment the cnrting
Was lifted from Gentleman Joe,
And the giddy old johnnies below
Sat close to the stage in a row
Whilst a god near the ceiling
Led “ popular feeling ”
To battle for Gentleman Joe,
Ho ! ho!
He barracked for Gentleman Joe.
The farce made a promising start,
It seemed almost certain to “go;”
The multitude, cheering
Each idol’s appearing,
Shed glory on Gentleman Joe.
His Nibs in the principal part
Was Coddington.Bradfield, so
Before he had spoken
They gave him a token
Of favor for Gentleman Joe.
The praise they had come to bestow
Diminished in vigor, although
That god near the ceiling
Was proudly revealing
His love for poor Gentleman Joe,
Ho ! ho I
He barracked for Gentleman Joe.
The critics were troubled with doubts
When Act number 2 travelled slow j
Few ditties and dances
To tickle their fancies
Are worked into Gentleman Joe.
But the god’s burly baritone shouts
Dispelled all suspicion of woe j
His singular gladness
Made mirth ot the sadness
Attaching to Gentleman Joe,
Each lady and gent in the co.
Doth a deep debt of gratitude owe
To that voice near the ceiling.
Persistently pealing
Gay laughter at Gentleman Joe.
Ho ! ho!
He barracked for Gentleman Joe.
The plot is as bald as an egg,
The characters slighter than snow;
Some songs of Palotta’s
And Ryley’s are “ rottahs,”
And, furthermore, Gentleman Joe
Is weak in the matter of “leg”—
Which is, weally, the cwuellest blow ;
And Dt cima’s what is
Called cronk in the glottis,
The place whence sweet melodies flow.
Maud Hobson gets darned little show,
Fred. Kaye’s bit of pudding is dough ;
Yet the god near the ceiling
Brought ointment for healing
Sore places in Gentleman Joe.
Ho! ho!
He barracked for Gentleman Joe.

Syria Lamont is a cousin of Florence Gsdaile, and,
therefore, Jewish. By the way, there are more Jewesses
than Jews on the professional stage, although Moses out-
numbers Rebecca among the amateurs. Both sexes of

boys seem the more content to retire into private life.

Wallace Brownlow is the strong man of the profesh.
His exhibition of muscle in “Mam’zelle Nitouche” was
only a moderate specimen. In playing “Paul Jones” for
the first time the management had to provide extra-strong
supers, for the stage struggle ; the originals having suc-
cumbed after two nights’ maltreatment.
Miss Amy Sherwin, says the cable, has been robbed of
her costly presents, jewels and stage-dresses by a con-
siderate burglar. The Bulletin hopes that Amy is as
well-advertised at the other end of the cable as she is here.
Cabled that some of Mrs. Langtry’s jewels, valued at
£40,000, have been obtained from the Union Bank of
London by means of a forged order. It is presumed that
the loss will fall on the bank.
Stanway, the shipping-clerk implicated in the Rosenfeld
Customs fraud (Vic.) some time ago, who got three
months’ gaol, and was released on account of bad health,
has since died of_ cancer. “Jack” Stanway, as he was
familiarly known in amateur-musical circles, was looked
on at the time of the trial as merely the tool of the prin-
cipals. The Judge was of that opinion—hence the small
sentence. Stanway was an enthusiastic helper in all
charitable projects, and was, perhaps, Melbourne’s best
amateur comedian. His was a sad end—he fell a victim
to the too-oommon alternative : do what we want you to
do, or go and starve.

Edith Courtney, the best of the lady Morocco Bounders,
returns to her native Europe this week. Edith stayed for
a year’s engagement with the Firm after “ M. 8.” pegged
out, but the Firm, as it happened, couldn’t give her much

Miss Gracie Dudley, paragraphed in a London paper as
coming from Melbourne and now playing parts in the
English provinces, was some years ago an infant-prodigy
in the “Curfew shall not toll to-night” line, and para-
lysed Melb. society with her precocious recitative talents.
She was then a baby-faced, golden-locked darling, with a
strong family likeness to Mabel Love. Her mother was
the popular manageress of Melb. Coffee Palace. In saying
that Gracie D. played the page in “ Brighton,” the
English paper quoted by Tub Bulletin is probably mixing
up the identities. It w'as her sister who was a member of
Harry St. M mr’s co., and who became “ The Second Mrs.
David Christie Murray.” But that is another story.

“Fridolin”: “Melbourne is suffering much, these
times, from a tendency to discover amateur contralto
warblers who have ‘ a finer voice than Ada Crossley,’ or
‘a stronger voice than Crossley’s,’ which latter recom-
mendation could be fairly claimed for a steam-roller or a
factory-encine. As a rule, the new wonder is a wild, un-
trammelled performer with a compass of six moans, and a
shocking facility for moaning out of tune. In the best
oases she has a voice of good quality which needs to have
a lot of superfluous noise taken from it, and can’t possibly
be truly judged by the standard of excellence in its pre-
sent state. And since the singer and her circle of admirers
are, generally speaking, satisfied that the voice has com-
pleted its education, the ‘Crossleys’ now most talked
about are the least likely to be heard of in five years’
time. A really line singer comes out with a bang, and
stays there.
During the stay of Stoddart’s professionals at the Old
White Hart, Melbourne, “Jimmie ” Norrie was instruct-
ing a quartette (himself included) to sing the old song,
“Scotland’s Burning.” They were getting along
famously, in the backyard, Norrie using a folded copy of
the Age as a baton. “Scotland’s burning,” &c., “Pour
on water,” yelled the quartette—when suddenly a power-
ful stream deluged the singers, it was Lockwood, the
Surrey pro., concealed at the other end of the yard, who
had turned on the hose and granted their request.
How these singers love one another! ’Tis said that
when the divine Patti reappeared in London a month
or so ago, Melba, for the time in the shade, rtmarked
spitefully: “ Well, she ought to be a good singer ; she has
had plenty of practice. Didn’t the great Duke of Welling-
ton admire her very much ?”

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

Bitile than the sects have done, or misunderstand it so
completely. The Bible, however, must be used from
artistic motives on the stage nnd without any suspicion
of saving anybody’s soul in the matter. It never could
be to the advantage of the English drama to get itself
blessed and anointed along with the religious magazines
and religious elchings and engravings ; though, doubt-
less, there would be a huge harvest of wealth and pro-
sperity to be reaped if, by chance, our great religious
public took to saving its soul through the medium of reli-
gious melodrama as it now saves its soul by means of
cheap, religious prints and serial stories in the Sunday at
Homs."
Brough and Boucicault are reserving “ The Notorious
Mrs. Bbbsmith ” for Sydney. Mr. Brough, every one will
regret to hear, has been very unwell lately.
In the old cemetery at Newtown (Sydney) is a row of
four "professional” graves. One monument, adorned
with a harp and broken harp-strings, and the figure of a
kneeling, weeping woman, is inscribed to the memory of
Nicholas Charles Bocksa, died 6th Jan., 1858, aged 65
years, " erected by his loving pupil. Anna Bishop.” The
next is to the memory of George Peck, “ Leader of the
orchestra of the Royal Princess’s Theatre, Sydney.”
The third, a very modest one, to Carandini’s old friend,
Lavenu, A.R.A.M., who died Aug. I, 1859 ; and the fourth
to the memory of a Sydney favorite actor and manager,
John Gordon Griffiths, of the ‘‘Old Vic.,” Pitt-street, who
died 4th March, 1857, aged 47.
Dear Bulletin,— A recent “Poverty Point” par. says
Louise Pomeroy was “married on the Ballarat stage in
‘Romeo aid Juliet.”’ Now, I was best man; and she
wasn’t. Louise was married in Bendigo—not on the stage,
but in the church of the Rev. Garlick, who tied the knot.
(The piece being performed at the Princess’s, Bendigo,
was “Romeo and Juliet.”) Dr. J. E. Neild gave the bride
away. Sassiety folks played the larrikin exactly as at the
Essie Jenyns wedding in Sydney, and poor Pomeroy was
quite hysterical, and nearly fainted. We had trouble to
get the wedding-party into the church, as it was already
crammed to the doors, and the unruly mob in silks and
laces did a deal of damage to the seats and the church
furniture.— Best Man.

A third and altogether new account of the Bank
of New Zealand’s finances arrives by mail. This is the
statement which Treas. Ward laid before Parliament, so,
presumably, it must be authentic. It sets forth that the
Estates Cos., for which the B.N.Z. is responsible, owes
£4,376,427 and has assets worth £2,580,746 (though
another valuation apparently sets them down at consider-
ably less); shortage about £1,800,000. The bank has
also a net deficit of £376,000 on its own account ; total,
£2 176,000. This is not taking into account a possible
further shortage in the bank of £200,000. When
the B.N.Z. capital (£900,000) and the proceeds
(estimated at £450,000) of the call now’ coming
in are both written off, they will provide for
- 1 350,000; so that according to these figures there
will still apparently be a deficit of £726,000 on the
highest valuaoon of the assets, and saying nothing of
further possible losses in the bank. This explains the
otherwise mysterious proviso that the bank is to pay
£50,000 annually to the Estates Cos. towards reducing the
deficiency, which, even if there are no further “ revela-
tions,” will take a good many years to wipe off.
The Govt, has already guaranteed £2. 000,000 on
account of the bank. It is now to take up £500,000 in
preference shares. And in addition it is to lend to the
bank £2,734,000 worth of 3J per cent, bonds on the
security of the Estates Go’s landed properties, valued at
£1,879,000, and on the uncalled capital of the bank.
Therefore, the State guarantees now amount to
£5,234,000. The position of the shareholders is some-
thing like this: All their existing capital is lost. They
are called upon to pay up £500,000 which is also lost.
They are then to be called upon to pay another £500,000
as working capital, which is mortgaged to the Govern-
ment in case the remaining deficit cannot be paid out of
the bank’s profits ; and apparently they are liable for yet
another £500,000 if required. Altogether the saving of
the 8.N.Z., if it is fully saved, has been about the biggest
dead lift on record. Meanwhile the London shareholders,
w'ho represent over one-third of the shares, are still un-
settled and aggravated, and will possibly make further
trouble.
* * * *
Under the N.S.W. Land and Income-tax Bill,
it seems to be an open question whether banka are not
liable for income-tax on the interest which they pay to
their depositors and debenture-holders. Also, though a
man holding unencumbered land of less value than £475
is exempt from taxation, a man holding mortgages of less
value than £475 is not exempt. Therefore, it may come
to pass that a piece of land is exempt when the owner is
in good circumstances and his property is not mortgaged,
but if he is poor and his land is mortgaged then it becomes
taxable. The Bill is most indefinite, but it seems to
read that way, anyhow, though the Supreme Court may
decide differently. Said Court will have a good deal of
hard work to do before it is finished interpreting the mys-
teries of this hazy measure, and it will provide fees for
many expensive barristers and solicitors.
Of the mortgages registered in South Australia
last year more than a quarter were at 5 per cent. ; more
than another quarter were at from 6 to 10 per cent. ;
more than a-third were simply at “ current banking
rates," which probably average 8 per cent. ; and a small
proportion —about one-sixlieth —were at 10 per cent, or
more. The S.A. Savings Bank lends money at 4J per
cent., and the local Fat Man argues from this that there
is no need for a State Land Bank. But the above figures
-bow that all the Savings Bank has to lend is a mere drop
in the ocean compared to the demand, and the Sand 10
per cent. Shylock si ill flourishes exceedingly, and requires,
in the public interest, to be obliterated.

Cabled that the Colonial Bank of Maoriland has
made a net profit for the half-year of £11,279, against
£12,473 last half-year and £16,436 the one before. The
div. at Sept., 1894, was at the rate of 7 per cent, per
an. ; last half year it fell to 6 per cent, (equal to £12,000),
and this time, if there is a div., it will evidently have to
be cut down to five. Meanwhile, the question is hung up,
pending the arrangement for selling out the business to
the B.N.Z. Despite the emphatic assurances of the direc-
torate that all is well, rumors concerning the solidity of
the Colonial continue to circulate, and the apparent readi-
ness of everybody concerned to trade off the business to
the B.N.Z. looks as if there was a considerable lack of con-
fidence in its future. Another sign is that its £2 shares
were selling, when last heard of, at 17s.

Melbourne’s big importing firms are bitterly
opposed to some high duties and secretly in favor of
others. It happens that in the case of woollens only two
or three wholesale houses (one especially) stand to profit
much by high duties, therefore the influence of the retail
tailoring trade is strong enough to bring the tariff down.
Every master-tailor—and his employes’ interests are iden-
tical with his own—is a manufacturer of clothes standing
in this position. He must either buy taxed foreign cloths
or untaxed goods from the local mills, and he wishes to
Heaven that the Victorian millers could supply him with
the stuff his customers demand. He is the friend, not the
enemy, of local production —a warm Protectionist up to a
certain point, say 15 per cent. But when the duty upon
goods which he can’t buy from local mills is higher than
he can afford to plank down in ready cash at the Customs,
the tailor has to get what he wants from the middleman
importer, who cheerfully pays the 40 per cent, tax and
adds it, plus usury, to the price of his cloths.^
Would the Reid Govt, have affixed a punitive
condition to the appointment of any member of the com-
munity except ex-Premier Dibbs to the vacant managing-
trusteeship of N.S.W. Savings Bank? The casting of the
condition in Dibhs’ face on the very threshold of the
undertaking, is calculated to excite an obstinate and able
foe to work his hardest to prevent that amalgamation of
the banks on which Premier Reid professes to have set
his heart.

The Victorian railway deficit for the year ended
30th June is £380,000. The Railway Commission pro-
poses various devices whereby it is reckoned that £365,000
may he saved annually, thereby reducing the shortage to
£15,000. It is proposed to save £85,000 off wages ;
£BO,OOO off fuel ; £107,000 by closing the Port Melbourne
and various other workshops, and concentrating the
building and repairing work in one or two large shops ;
£40,000 by a revision of fares and freights ; and £103,000
by abolishing all free passes, and charging the various
Govt, departments for services rendered. A large part of
the railway deficit is caused by carrying goods and per-
sons free for the benefit of other public departments, and
the Commissioners rightly object to having their deficit
enlarged so that other Govt, offices may show a bogus
economy. The Vic. railway accounts have not balanced
since 'B9, and if they can be squared now it will be quite
a new experience.

The Queensland Mutual Assurance Cos. (paid-up
capital £15,477) has made the very handsome profit of
£4380 for the year ended 30th June. An 8 per cent. div.
is declared; £229 14s. lOd. is placed to investment-fluctua-
tion account, making it £6OO ; and £2912 added to profit
and loss account, making the credit balance £6133. The
Q. Mutual, though it has been doing business for seven
years, has no reserve-fund.
The case of the Queensland Mutual, like that of
all other such offices, is an evidence that fire-insurance, on
the present competitive system, doesn’t pay the insurer.
It doesn’t always pay the co. either, but it pays the
insurer worst of all. There are between 50 and 60 fire co’s
doing business in Australasia, and the public has to pay
for all their separate hoards, office staffs, agency
staffs, premises, advertising, and all the rest.
The natural consequence is that it gets a lot more
office expenses than fire insurance for its money.
Last year the public paid to the Q. Mutual
£14,033 in premiums and got bacK £4233 in fire losses.
The Victoria collected £115,000 premiums ; paid £35,000
losses. The Australian Mutual Fire Society, premiums,
£29,000 ; losses, £6700. N.Z. Insurance Cos., premiums,
£265,000; losses, £154,000, and so on through the whole
list. Evidently the public pays between twice and three
times as much for its insurance as the actual insurance is
worth, the balance going in working costs and divs.
—principally the former. Private co’s, so far as it is
possible to estimate, can’t do the business any cheaper
under existing conditions ; the biggest outlay is for com-
mission and office expenses, and the offices must pay
these and other charges or get no business. But if it
were possible to establish a system of compulsory muni-
cipal insurance—all buildings and contents within the
municipality 7 , except possibly some extra hazardous
risks, to be kept permanently insured, and the
premiums collected in the same manner as other
rates, only a good deal more stringently ; and if
it were possible to run the system honestly and intelli-
gently, and the premiums were, say 7 ,lo per cent, less than
those now charged, and if several other tilings could come
to pass, fire insurance, with the commission and a lot of
the office expenses saved, should furnish a handsome
income to the municipalities. The Central Govt, couldn’t
run such a business profitably, as it requires local know-
ledge ; but municipal fire insurance, if conducted on plain
business lines, should be a practicable speculation. The
chief difficulty would be in the constant inclination to
put the alderman’s brother Bill in chatge of the business,
instead of engaging an expert who was nobody’s brother
in particular. Brother Bill is the bane of many an other-
wise promising undertaking.

The balance-sheet of the Standard Bank (Melb.)
presents some striking features. The profit and loss
account shows a deficiency of £17,979 (the shortage of the
half-year being £4900), yet the bank proudly exhibits a
reserve-fund of £4OOO. The directors might have added
£96,000 more to the reserve and made the deficiency on
the other side £114,000, but somehow they didn’t. The
deposits, current accounts, interest, accrued, and amounts
due to other banks are £766,000, and the institution has
apparently £10,228 in cash against them, W'hioh is about
the most abbreviated cash reserve on record. The board
regretfully remarks that many accounts are so bad
that it didn’t even go through the formality of debiting
them with interest, doubtless because it knew the interest
couldn’t be collected. Nothing was said about the chance
of collecting the principal. Also, £32,000 of interest has
been charged but not reckoned as profit, apparently
because the accounts, though not so bad as the other lot,
were too decomposed to be viewed with any certainty.
A good many banks seem chiefly to have three kinds of
advances. One is putrifled ; the second is only gamey ; and
the hoard is busy all its time keeping the flies off the
third lot.

Melb. Permanent Building Society, which lately
got its debenture interest reduced from 5 to 21 per cent.,
reports sorrowfully that, despite the saving of £9300
under this head alone, it has failed to make ends meet for
the past year. The shortage is £SOB. The net income is
about 1J per cent, per annum on the assets. House and
land property to the nominal value of £456,000 forms
four-fifths of the said assets, and the net returns under
this head are about 13s. per cent, for the year. The board
is of opinion that the property won’t yield more than £1
per cent, for a long while to come. Among the assets are
150 Commercial Bank of Australia preference shares at
£lO (£1500), said shares being now 7 worth something under
355. ; also, 150 Australian Deposit and Mortgage Bank
preference shares at £5 (£750), present value an abso-
lutely unknown quantity. The institution will probably
pull through in the long run, its present loss being owing
to reconstruction expenses : still, its balance-sheet is a
remarkably steep document in mere ways than one.

The National Bank of Maoriland states that it
has made a net profit for the year of £16,000, and after

Maoriland has lost confidence in all its three banks —for
the time, anyhow. There has been altogether too much

Freetrade S.M. Herald, in its “Notes from
Western Australia” (7/9/’95), at last acknowledges to
Protectionists its fatal fiscal error:—“ It will be gathered,
therefore, that the W.A. Government are holding out
every inducement to practical agriculturists in the shape
of cheap land, a protective tariff, and an entire absence of
any harassing conditions.” Since a protective tariff is
inducement to immigrants from distant homes, the P.T.
must indeed be a part and parcel of good government.
The S.M. Herald says so, and surely she is an honorable

Dear Bulletin,—Your remarks re examination
of meat, for exportation may also apply to the N.S.W. ex-
port butter-trade. If butter-consumers only got a
glimpse of the process of making butter at many of the
Australian factories, I think an anti-butter-eating society
would be formed. Not long ago, at a meeting of share-
holders of a district milk-and-butter co., the city manager
of the co. publicly staled that the “stuff ” they were_ ex-
porting was “ damnableand no wonder, for to go into
many milking-yards on a wet morning and see the filth
scraped off, in the milking, into the milk-pails would be
sufficient to satisfy any appetite, save a hog’s, for either
milk nr butler. The dairyman being either too busy or
too lazy, saves unnecessary trouble by reckoning on the
separator to free the milk of all filth, and the butter pro-
duced from this blend of milk and cow-excrement is ex-
pected to compete against the cleanly-produced article
of such countries as Denmark, Belgium and Holland. —

A pathetic old bushman called in recently at
Toowoomba (Q.) Savings Bank, and wanted to deposit his
little pile as a provision for his last days. Said pile con-
sisted principally of notes of the Bank of Queensland
which burit disastrously in ’66. The pathetic old man
had hoarded them carefully for over 30 years. He had
never heard of the historic collapse of Queensland’s first
big bank, and when the matter was mentioned to him he
replied that it didn’t signify—the Govt, would pay up the
value of the notes. Then the officials tried to explain
that Govt, wouldn’t pay anything ; that bank-notes w ; ere
simply the I O U’s of a crowd of private speculators who
were responsible to nobody, and that the value of his
savings was nil. The old man, however, refused to
believe this monstrous assertion, and went away smiling
with his decomposed paper-money in his hand. He died
shortly afterwards, perhaps through learning the solemn
reality of the situation. The local paper calls this “a
remarkable proof of the faith which some men have in
the face-value of a bank-note.” So it is. It is also a
remarkable evidence of the iniquity of the private-bank-
note system which Queensland has abolished, but which
the other Australias still adhere to with such touching
fidelity.

tinct traces of it at Charters Towers and Ballarat. The
Great Boulder line becomes bigger as it proceeds—puts

Editor Bulletin, —A Melb. paper compares a
much-boomed Melville (W.A.) claim with the Charters
Towers Day Dawn. In my opinion, a nearer comparison
would be l.tie Day Dawn of Cue, W.A. A property that
can only crush 7dwts. to the ton from picked stone won’t
do much more than pay for “pick-points” in this
country.—JacKes Drummond, late of Charters Towers,

Dear Bulletin, —Re “ Economy ” and “ Orneo ”
on Democrat mine, Glen Wills (Vic.). Taking stipendiary
director’s screw at, say, £7 per week ; the mine-manager,
£6 per week ; underground-manager, at £3 5s. ; and two
shift-bosses at £2 15s. each, you arrive at a total of £21
15s. per week. This, with a reef averaging 3in. wide,
hard ground, with 19s. lOd. for carting and crushing
added, gives the shareholders “ Buckley’s ’’ chance of
profit. The whole business is over-managed, and could be
fully attended to by a competent miner as manager and
two shift-bosses, who have to be provided under the
Mining Act. —Rad.

The Celestial has not yet got footing on the
West Coast of Tasmania. About five years ago two

Eventually they were rescued by the policeman and
locked up till an opportunity came to ship them away
again. Tas. miners don’t love John. They had enough
of him on the E. Coast tin-fields, from which they were
practically ousted by the almond-eyed.

Dear Bulletin, —Be Stead’s “Penny
Poets.” I would like to believe that the “masses”
love poetry. Unfortunately, the love of poetry
in the true sense is rather rare. Good jingle
tickles most ears; maudlin sentiment in rhyme,
like that in some of Sims’ ballads, stirs the
emotions —especially those of women ; and stirring
martial verse, like Macaulay’s or Kipling’s, is
generally relished ; but, for all that, the great
bulk of the people have no appreciation of
“poetry.” Keats, Matthew Arnold, Poe,
Swinburne, if obtainable at Id. each, would
hardly be read, and certainly not understood, by
more than 25 per cent, of the people—if that.
This is no defamation of Demos, but a statement
of fact, regretable, yet easily accounted for. It
takes a long time for culture and light to diffuse ;
and, perhaps, the spread of knowledge and the
appeals to the imagination and better instincts
by such works as “ Looking Backward,” under-
standable by an ever-widening circle, are as good
a preparation as any. — Dingo.
In this land of “busted” banks and building
societies and “gone bung” institutions of all
descriptions, where the struggle for living causes
every dealer to make the biggest profit on his
wares, it is a pleasure to come across a genuine
article, and this is a reason for every one to
make trial of the B.L. Corto Rothschild cigars.
For many years the Corto factory lias been the
sole suppliers to the famous Rothschild family in
London, Paris, and Vienna, who are all heavy
smokers ; and B.L. Cortos are also the popular
weed at all European courts. Of late the Corto
factory has forwarded supplies of its manufactures
to the Australian market, and without doubt its
Rothschilds are the best value a refined taste can
desire for Gd. The B.L. Corto Rothschild cigars

■ A person signing himself “Petitioner”
writes to S.M. Herald saying; “It does not
seem likely that the deep instinct of prayer which
almost universally exists, is a mockery.” Well,
what about the universal instinct of drink ? Also,
the instinct of dirt, which was practically uni-
versal until a very short time ago, and is nearly
universal even yet? Where does the tobacco-
instinct come in, and the instinct of “ immorality,”
which is a lot more general and more deep-rooted
than the praying instinct? The most universal
instincts which The Bulletin can remember just
now are drink, tobacco, profanity, dirt, ghosts,
dishonesty, making love to another fellow’s wife,
leaving things till to-morrow, prayer and lying.
And, if the universalness of one instinct croves
anything, how about the others?

The people who prayed for rain the other
day, in N.S. Wales, were wise in their day and
generation, and took no chances. They waited
patiently through weeks of drought and bush-
fires, until one morning three meteorologists—
lodd, Russell, and Wragge—all announced that
rain might be expected in a few days. That same
day they fixed their prayers for tile ensuing Sun-
day, and the rain came, and since then they have
suffered from an aggravated attack of swelled
head. One clerical gentleman even wrote to the
Herald pointing out four previous occasions
when rain came within 11 days after prayer. In
reply to him a scientific person explained that
on one of these occasions the rain was only a few
drops, and then the drought settled down once
more, whereupon they prayed again and got no
rain for four months. Moreover, even in the
worst drought it almost always rains to some
extent in some part of the province every week,
and as any rain anywhere can be quoted as an
answer to prayer, the answer can always be relied
on. The rain-making I nisi ryjs.s is very much like
tossing with a two-headed copper.

Sunday, the “ clay of humiliation and
prayer” (for rain), ordered by N.S.W. Premier

The rumor as to a confession by “ Possum ”
Dean, the now historic Sydney ferry-steamer cap-
tain, though denied by Dean himself, has greatly
tended to discredit him, and his character has
been further prejudiced by the diplomatieally-
evasive nature of the answers given to Parlia-
mentary questions on the subject. Chagrim d
Officialdom emphatically is not fighting on the
side of Dean. Dean should in an affidavit reiterate
his denial as to ever having made any such state-
ment and send it to the press.
“ Possum ” has now been promoted to a
new ship, and has been successfully summoned
for 12s. (Id. a week for maintenance by his wife,
whom the crowd loudly hooted as she left tin-
court. This is the very “peripheral neuritis” of
humorous agony. She said he poisoned her ; she
nearly hanged him, and all but buried him alive.
He can’t divorce her, and she can’t divorce him
for any Windeyeresque offence. She’s got their
child, and also alimony. He’s got promotion, so
that, after the end of the fixed alimony period,
which is six months, she’ll probably “rise” him
to £l. 0 gee-gee of matrimony, goo-goo of parent-

News that Lady Brassey is an ardent
wheelist has set many Toorakiennes a-praetising
the uncertain “bike.” The Bourke-street Rotunda
holds quite a bevy of leading social lights every
day struggling to get a dignified balance on the
wobbly wheel. The only male present at these
giddy functions is the trainer, and he, poor man,
must have a lively time. He is not allowed to lay
hands on Toorakia’s sacred body, so he has rigged
up a wooden handle arrangement fixed under the
seat wherewith he keeps the wriggling dame steady.
The momentous question as to how much shall
remain uncovered will be decided after note has
been taken of what is displayed by the wife of the
Golden Calf, which, though it has not yet arrived,
Victoria is already so assiduously worshipping.
Gov. Brassey is believed to be worth at least six
uillions sterling.

News of Baron Brassey is cabled to Mel-
bourne from every port where he stops to take in
coal and fresh provender. The other day he rested
his craft at St. Helena, and the Governor of that
dismal rock gave him a grand banquet, consisting
probably of idled leg o’ mutton and trimmings.
There isn’t much pomp and magnificence at St.
Helena. The place has no population worth men-
tioning, bar his Excellency and suite, who (when
not out fishing) spend most of their time in gazing
at Napoleon Buonaparte’s tomb and wishing they
were dead.
There has been in Melbourne a bicycle
church-parade, attended by 200 riders. Very con-
ducive to devotion, this pious rallying of the Calf-
and-Breastbone brigade. The man who will goto
church on a bicycle is the sort of person who will
typewrite his love-letters.

(fovt. House, Melb., wants refurnishing
badly. The stuff at present filling the rooms is
old-fashioned and shabby. It was bought in the
early Loch days, and was not conserved by the
Hopetoun children—two boys, with destructive
instincts that ought to make them useful Radicals
some day. It is scarcely likely that Brassey and
Mrs. B. will be content to squat about on chairs
with the stuffing bulging out of them, and every-
thing looking like a second-hand shop. Perhaps
they will take pity on a hard-up province, and re-
furnish the place themselves. At present, all
that is being done to Govt. House is to repaint
the outside gates.

When Don’fc-you-feel-well Smith was in
London, standing on his head at the door of the
Victorian Court at the Imperial Institute, and
trying to force Australian vegetables and wine
down the Prince of Wales’s throat, he secured
possession of the plans of Hampton Court maze,
a replica of which famous labyrinth is now being
made, under “L.L.’s” supervision, at Melb.
Exhibition ; and he hopes to have it ready by the
time Brassey arrives. “L.L.” has formed him-
self into a committee, as chairman of the Exhibi-
tion trustees, to assist in welcoming Brassey.
The hawthorities, however, that “ L.L.’’will get
lost in his own maze on the great day.

An aristocratic drunk, whose Bacchanalian
vagaries are the subject of numberless yarns,
wandered over from Melb. Princess’s Theatre to
the Burke and Wilis monument the other night.
It was pitch dark, and after resting against the
granite base for half-an-hour, he concluded to
move onward. Feeling with his hands carefully
before him he traversed one side of the plinth,
carefully turned the corner, moved onwards again
to the next corner, and so on until he had walked
completely round the stone. Then with a super-
human effort he made another circuit. After a
rest of 10 minutes he repeated the exercise, and in
an hour and three-quarters had performed 24
revolutions. Then, utterly exhausted, lie lifted
up a weird cry. “Oh! the blankers have locked
me in ! ” and sank in a limp heap to the pavement.

One of the deah boys of a big Maoriland
squatting family married about a year ago, and
the day preceding the ceremony called to take
leaye of the Hebe officiating at a city liar. On
arriving, however, the prospective benedict found
a brother of the lady on hand, the hitter being of
opinion that his sister had not been fairly treated
by the man of flocks and herds. A short dis-
cussion on the subject led to somebody getting
“ stoushed,” and 20 minutes of hard “dealing it
out’’ resulted in two black eyes and numerous
minor contusions on the countenance of the bride-
groom-elect. A hansom was summoned, and the
sufferer was conveyed post-haste to an eminent
surgeon, who worked all night, and hang the
expense, fixing up the gilded one’s face for the
ceremony. With the aid of surgery and grease-
paint, he was brought to a condition that none
but the front row of the church and the immediate
participators in the affair could distinguish from
normal, but the blushing bride, one of Maoriland’s
prettiest girls, had the unique experience of honey-
mooning with a husband with two black eyes.

Editor Bulletin,-—lt must be borne in
mind that the fixing of an “age of consent”

its absurdity comes in. The Vic. Crimes Act

ledge,” thus any man is at liberty to marry a
child of 12 without let or hindrance, while if that
same child (as a widow, after three and a-half
years of married life) be complaisant to a 17-year-
old boy, the latter can be sent to gaol for three
years with hard labor! By the way, doesr’f. a
constitution which permits two states in almost
similar latitudes to enact laws so startlingly
different as ’Frisco’s 10-year age of consent and
New York’s prospective 21, strike the federating
Australian as one to be diary of? State rights
will always lead to this sort of tiling. Let us
have Dibbs’s unicameral system of Federation
rather than anomalies such as these.—M‘G.

A hard-up Sydneyite, whose wife pre-

Dr. Lloyd. J.P., the ma rvied- worn an’s

I suppose this sort of tiling will go on till lialf-a-dozen
murderous husbands have been hanged, and then the re-
mainder will quiet down.
But murderous husbands have been hanged times
out of mind, and the wife-beater is still here. For
thousands of years people have been hanged and
otherwise slaughtered for doing the things which
they continue to do to-day quite regardless of the
alleged deterrent. Experience does not teach fools
wisdom, for some continue to murder—and others
to advocate hanging.

There is a clamor in N.S.W. backblocks
for more J.sP., and the Colonial Secretary pro-
poses to add to the 4000 and odd now on the roll.
Mr. Brunker might find time to enquire and
strike a few useless items off. Notably one in
Sydney, whom no seasoned policeman will run in.
A new-chum constable occasionally gets hold of
him under the “ vag.”—only to be told by the
watch-house recorder that he, the N.C.0., is a
fool; result, that policeman never runs-in that
J.P. again. Another backblocks J.P., now in the
city, lives chiefly on borrowed 3d. bits. Justices
of this type had a good time in Sydney before the
Stipendiaries were appointed. They had only to
offer to sit at one of the city courts to be imme-
diately bought off by some of the great unpaid
with the price of a pint of beer.
There is to be seen in a
Melbourne shop - window a
machine designed for use by
ghosts who may be desirous of
imparting their opinions on
things in general to a fleshly
world. It consists of a revolving
disc with two pointers, and an
external circle on which appear
the alphabet and numerals, and
the words “ Yes ” and “ No.”
This saves the ghost the trouble
of counting off the letters by
raps. All lie has to do is to jab
at the machine and stop it when
the right letter is under one of
the pointers. If it isn’t under
that one it may happen to be
under the other, or something of
that kind. The advantages of
the machine are obvious, and no
well-equipped ghost should go
on'tour without one. It is pre-
sumably of ghostly manufac-
ture, though not bearing a label
to that effect. Anyhow, the
ghost that is muscular enough
to throw tables about ought not
to be stumped at a bit of easy
carpentering work. Here is a
new danger to the sweated
toiler. Ghosts can live much
cheaper than anyone else, as
they don’t require any food
beyond an occassional box of
chocolate-creams.

Charity-secretary Maxted
has urged on the directors of
Sydney Benevolent Asylum the
grave necessity for an alteration
of the N.S. W. law of affiliation,
“ in the direction of compelling
support by fathers from or
before birth.” Which recalls
something to the present un-
regenerate scri be. Fifteen years
ago, in the Queensland sugar-
country, a young white man
was courting a comely white
housemaid belonging to his
boss’s plantation. The house-
maid aforesaid, having made a
certain communication to Mrs.
Sugar Planter, Mr. Planter put
it to the young man that he
had better marry Mary if he
didn’t want to lose his excellent
billet. The young man did
marry Mary, and when the little
stranger arrived it proved to be
a half Kanaka. There are, after
all, one or two reasonable arguments in favor of
the eash-on-delivery system.
Barrister Evangelist Field, perhaps de-
spairing of the alleged Christians, has now taken
in hand the conversion of the Sydney Jews —one
of the biggest dead lifts on record. Another big
dead lift is that undertaken by Sydney Women’s
Temperance Association, which proposes to cond
vert the N.S.W. shearers by means of services and
tracts. Yet another heavy hoist is contemplatet
by Adelaide W.C.T.U., which declares thas
women voters should only vote for candidate!
pledged to legislate for the abolition of the sale o
liquors and tobacco, and of gambling in every
lonn, also for raising the age of consent for girls
to 21 years. The pious political hen is jealous of
grog, jealous of smoke, jealous of young women.
If she could, she would raise the age of consent to
her own age—say, about 54.

Melbourne has many people willing to be
martyred in the anti-vaccination cause. The
other day, F, J. Sincock, solicitor, accepted three
days’ gaol rather than pay a 10s. fine for refusing
to have his child vaccinated. His conscience
would not permit him to pay the fine, he said.
Lawyers usually have their consciences more
under control.

Now that the daily newspapers of Aus-
tralia have abandoned separate cable services, or
services representing a two or three combiim,
what moral or party principle or business prospect
hinders those in one city agreeing to the employ-
ment of a single reportorial staff? The point has
struck newspaper managers before to-day, and,
in a tentative sort of way, excursions in that
direction have been made, but the fear of some
undefined evil overshadowed the experiments.
The amalgamated cable-service will, if it succeeds,
give these enterprising spirits hearts of hope, and
some day we shall see one reporter only where
four now earn bread and butter.

A serious-looking man in a black suit last
week entered the office of an Australian daily,
and, accosting a reporter, asked for the editor.
The sub-editor, leader of the staff, and the pro-
prietor being all “ out,” the serious man turned to
the reporter himself. “Well, perhaps you’ll do,”
he began, producing a piece of paper from his
pocket. “Last Monday a young fellow came to
my parsonage—l’m a clergyman—Rev. Zedediah
Jagson is my name—and he had a young woman—
a rather comely young woman—with him, and he
said, ‘My name’s Jobkins, and I’m a compositor
on the Daily Tinpot, and this lady’s my young
woman, and we want to be married.’ Then I
married them in the usual manner; and after that
Mr. jobkins asked me what my fee was. I replied
it was a guinea. ‘ But that’s far too little for
such a happy occasion,’ Mr. Jobkins remarked—
‘ Let me write out a cheque for £5 ss.’ And be
did, and this is the cheque he gave me ; it’s been
dishonored—marked ‘No account.’ Do you know
Mr. Jobkins? I don’t think it was right for him
to give me a cheque like that, do you? So I want
to see whether your editor will give me the £5 ss.

Jeimings-Carmichael mercifully refrains
from dragging the eternal Southern Cross into her

Melbourne's moribund Institute of Jour-
na ists has held a meeting to consider what ought
to happen to M.sP. who occasionally kick the
press. The precious institute doesn’t seem to
know that it invites the contumely of Hancock
ami Co. Every reporter abases himself before tin
gods in the ’Ouse or elsewhere. The gabble of the
member for Muckborough is quoted as though be
were the Voice of Heaven; a semi-insolvent soft-
goods importer is styled a “merchant prince’ by
the ungrammatical interviewer who crawls back-
wards from his presence; a muddle-headed mayor’s
luncheon is paragraphed until each person who
guzzled freo at the festivity imagines himself a
pillar of the universe. And yet the instituted
journalists object to being bruised by the boots
they are so fond of buttering. Eatted pigs have
good reason to despise their greasers.

Somebody who has forgotten all that he
ever knew about the circumstance, writes to
Melb. Herald re an old-time proposal to place
Marcus Clarke’s widow on the Victorian pension-
list. The misleading person says “an appeal was
made some years ago on Mrs. Clarke’s behalf,
when that large-hearted, though small-brained,
couple, Service and Patterson, were endeavouring
to control affairs, and they promised Parliament
that some arrangement should be made, instead of
grantingapension.” Gillies, thesuccessortoService,
controlled affairs in those days, whilst the “large-
hearted” Patterson distinguished himself by snort-
ing at Marcus Clarke’s memory, on the ground that
“the country wanted thinkers, not scribblers.
The meat-man beat his chest as he mentioned
“thinkers,” just to let the country know that one
living gas-bag was worth more to posterity than
99 dead novelists.

A noble example of self-reliance occurred
at the recent Melb. Agricultural show, when a
whiskered Vic. country youth, missing bis father
in the crowd, publicly blubbered at the top ot
his voice to a sympathetic band of old women.
Acting on advice he gave himself in charge to a
local policeman, presumably as a neglected child.

The Melb. policemen, apparently half-a-
dozen, who mistook another woman for Mrs.
Synnot, verify a number of stage plays, such as
Celeste’s “Like and Unlike.” Another such case
is that wherein Rachel acted the Roman Empress
Valeria, and a courtesan was mistaken for her.
Then there is the affair of the diamond-necklace,
with the mondaine Oliva posing as Marie
Antoinette.

Three years ago a Sydney lad
passed the N.S.W. pupil-teachers’ exam,
with credit, but received notification that
there was no vacancy for him. He forth-
with found employment as a clerk, begin-
ning at 10s. a week, which salary was raised
to 20s. and then to 305., and at Xmas he
is promised a further increase to £2. A
few days ago he received an official letter
appointing him to a school at 15s. per
week (minus 4 per cent, and cleaning-
fees). The young man, now 20, declined
with thanks. Evidently the Dept, had
expected him to gladly wait three years
for 15s. a week ! Lots do.

Dear Bulletin, —lie the conten-
tion that Jessie Nicholls was killed by the
scorn of her own sex. Such scorn affects
women very little, if not reinforced by
the neglect of the other sex. Few, though
willing to marry a widow, will propose to
a girl with “an encumbrance.” Besides,
there is a practical aspect to the question.
The support of an illegitimate child falls
upon the mother, while the father, who
ought, under the present arrangement of
society, to make provision for his own
child, can repudiate the whole responsi-
ble ty, unless forced to share it by the
affiliation law, which is seldom appealed
to, either from fear of the cruel exposure
in court or the woman’s love for her
deserter. Undoubtedly abortion is the
best alternative for the woman whose
love has overcome her instinct of self-
preservation, and it will be resorted to
while the present cruel conditions last,—

Here is an anomaly in the N.S. W. “Act
for the Supervision of Dairies ” ; A struggling
milk-retailer selling the produce of even only one
cow, has to satisfy all the stringent requirements
of the Act before he can sell one pint of milk; and
is also subject to regular inspection. On the
other hand, a dairyman—no matter how large his
establishment —is free from the operation of the
Act so long as he does not retail his milk or cream,
but converts it into butter. If it is necessary to
supervise the sale of milk, why should not the
same precautions be taken in the case of butter?
In the latter case, the spirit of the Act is evaded by
technicalities which need immediate attention.

A PRAYER FOR RAIN.
DAISY : “ Oh, mamma , may I pray for rain?”
MAMMA: “ Certainly, pel. I'm very glad my little girl is sorry for the suffering caused by
the drought."
DAISY: “ Oh, it isn't THAT, mamma; but Sophy Jones's picnic is to-morrow, and she
hasn't asked me."

A breach of promise case, talked about in
London, pivots on the sweetheart seeing his
fiancee one night painting her face before the
mirror in a strong gaslight. He was passing on
the opposite side of the street, and so much
aversion did her gestures and grimaces arouse,
that he asserts he “loathed her from that minute.”
Moral: Pull down the blinds.
The latest photographer’s joke. Two
fashionable misses, in search of novelty, were
piloted with their heads stuck through a shee.t of
Sydney Evening News. The girls fainted clean
away when the proof came home. Right across
the sheet was a splash clothier’s advt., with the
black-letter information, ‘‘Our pants are made
extra strong in the seats !’’ The ladies blushingly
decided upon a fresh sitting.
By the way, The Bulletin notes the appear-
ance in above par. of a new verb —the_ verb to
phote, and passes it as a distinct acquisition to
the English language. “Phote” the noun and
“phote” the verb are a great improvement on
“ photograph,” and even on “photo.”—just as
“phone” is a sensible abbreviation of “tele-
phone.” Also, this paper directs the attention of
Australian advertisers to the ’cute American prac-
tice of omitting the word “street,” and saving
time and money. “302 George” and “419
King ” are intelligible by everybody.

There is a vacancy for a preacher in Sfc.
James’s Church, Sydney, and, as is always the
case when there is a good clerical salary going,
the billet has been offered to a high-toned parson
in Hingland. The Australian church-goer is con-
vinced that only the Rev. J. Bull can communi-
cate successfully with the Deity, and whenever
there is a good enough salary to induce that
person to come out he gets the billet. If the
salary is so small that the Hinglish toiler in the
vineyard won’t look at it, then the miserable
Australian gets a show. Evidently the idea that
the Deity speaks with a strong Cockney accent
still prevails in this country. Next time_ N.S.W.
wants prayers for rain the Australian cleric should
go on strike, and tell the people to cable to Eng-
land and get a superior kind of British prayer
offered up there. If he is such a lamentably
inferior article, then his petition for moisture
surely can’t amount to much.

The Jessie Nicholls tragedy, like the
Deeming case, and the Dean baby-murders, and
almost every other sensational horror on record,
is an essay on the utter want of originality com-
monly displayed in getting rid of “the body.”
Anyone who knows how to effectually get rid of
the body can do murder with impunity so long as
he takes a few simple precautions. The body is
the beginning, middle and end of the case every
time ;no jury would convict without it; no Attor-
ney-General would prosecute if it couldn’t be
found ; and in 99 cases out of 100 there would be
no shadow of suspicion but for the discovery of it
clumsily stowed away in a box, or under a hearth,
or floating in the water, or in some other equally
foolish place. Many assassins are evidently
adepts at getting rid of the body, as witness the.
large number of unaccountable disappearances,
some of which must almost inevitably be due to
violence; but still the ignorance that exists with
regard to this comparatively simple subject is
amazing. The Bulletin has four different
schemes, each one of which is simple, speedy, and
so absolutely effective that not a vestige of the
deceased would remain. This paragraph may
help at some future date to account for the utter
evanishment of —well, several people.
LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wealth, joy, and radiant happiness,
Dear love, be never thine,
Unless in thy lot’s loneliness
Such blessings I entwine :
May Heaven vouchsafe to thee no friend
(The dearer shall ./ be) ;
No joy upon thy path descend
Until it come through me :
And should great griefs thy life befall
Ere many years elapse.
It warms my heart to think of all
I’ll do for thee—perhaps !

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
September 24, 1895.
My Dear Moorabinda—
I’d love to run my fingers reverently through
Mark Twain’s silky grey hair, worn d !a Benno
Scherek, whom M.T. somewhat resembles. He
might think it’s the custom of the country which
almostgrew the veteran Parkes, and bear with mein
consequence as one upon whom hair had an unfor-
seen effect. I prefer Mark’s pretty hair to his
eyes, which he kept half-closed at his first “at
home’’—probably to shut out the hideous spec-
tacle of a large Sydney audience so painfully on
the jump after jokes, that it’s a miracle the inimi-
table pathos of Hack Finn and the escaping slave
got the sympathetic hearing it did ; though one
scarcely blames the fixed grin with which Sydney
settled down to hear Mark Twain after a roar of
welcome which nearly lifted the building off its
four feet. Because Mark’s style is calmly, merci-
lessly comical—his mode of talking recalling
Monkhouse in his most unctuous moments as Dr.
Brierley— I never heard anything more like Monk-
house than Mr. Clemens’ drawling remark,
“Patience is such a virtue.” This tonal resem-
blance to the large and suggestive ’Arry makes
one at first suspect that there will be a double-
entente wrapped up in every sentence d la the come-
dian—but there isn’t, which may account for
the early departure of several fat men on the first
night after they had gazed their fill at the ’Murri-
can literary marvel. I think Mark quite fills the
eye as a lion. Small, spare, nervous, and thickly-
roaned, with a platform manner quite his own, he
ready looks Mark Twain. Thank heaven !
I sorted out Mrs. and Miss Clemens in the huge
audience partly because of the strong facial re-
semblance Miss C. bears to her father, and partly
because they sometimes forgot to smile at the lec-
turer’s jokes. You can always spot a lecturer’s
relations by the I’ve-heard-it-all-before apathy
they bring to bear on the case. Miss C. is a dis-
tinctly pretty girl, with ink-black hair and large,
dark eyes. She wore a black skirt with a yellow
silk blouse and black gloves—the lady who has the
honor to be Mrs. Clemens wearing a black silk
gown. They were supported by the Much-
Travelled, who fairly basked in the success of the
occasion.
The Polo Gymkhana, at Kensington, on the
18th, showed up in bas-relief the good imitation
of old Roman heartlessness inherent in Sydney
society. The steeplechase for hunters (amateurs
up) was a most unlucky race—only two nags stood
up at the finish, for all the rest came to grief.
One horse fell on its rider (Mr. M. Ford), and
pinned him to the ground—the poor animal break-
ing its hack ; another horse turned a flip-flap with
Lieut. Taylor, who was badly stunned—and the
grand-stand took all these casualties in the most
cheerful spirit in the world. Vapours are
no longer d la mode, and the swooning,
weeping variety of female is a hack-number.
Your pain and suffering have to be specially
hideous to corral the sympathy of a “ministering
angel ” who coolly turns away from the sight of a
man doubled up under a horse, and merely flutters
the leaves of her race-book to see what’s the next
show. Even the debutantes took the severe
croppers in a manner so stoical that a jockey’s
wife would blush at it. If it’s the incoming Gov.
Hampden’s humor to start bull-baiting, or sooling
the Tantanoola tiger on to the Salvation Army,
I can promise him lots of audience.
There must be two tutelary geniuses of fashion
—one for Jack and one for Jill, or else how was it
that nearly all the women at the polo wore bright
attire, while the men came anyhow? One patri-
cian—closely connected with a brand-new Earl-
looked a sketch in a creased water-tosh, oyster-
colored linen, a red tie, a round, cork-colored hat,
and the most pronounced basin-crop on the lawn;
though the funniest man was a sort of adjutant-
bird in cerulean blue, with his trousers carefully
turned up over a pair of buttercup boots. By the
way, I don’t think the recent prayers for rain in
the churches (and don’t they wish they could keep
it there so as to make the heathen come raging to
the sacred pile in order to get a dipperful!) are
responsible for the late refreshing drizzles we’ve
enjoyed. I think we have the Johnnies to thank
for it, who piously kept the pedal hems of their
nether garments folded up beyond high-mud-mark,
even when the “ droot ” was at its driest. Evi-
dently Providence was touched by such a mute
expression of good faith.
There was a large vice-regal party at the Gym-
khana. Acting vice-regal parties are apt to look
more swollen than the other sort, though it does
look awfully like making the must of things d la
the crowd in a hired buggy on a public holiday.
The cynosure of the V.R. box was Lady Holled-
Smith—a blonde, Jenny Watt-Tannerish per-
sonage who was tricked out in sea-green alpaca
coat and skirt, with revers of pale-green silk
brocaded in pale-pink roses ; a small hat trimmed
with pink and green ; and a white veil over her
complexion of Lady-Carington pink. Lady Smith
(no relation of mine, remember) is an attractive
sort of woman possessing a striking optical
peculiarity which, if she becomes a leader of
fashion, will probably set Southern society gazing
steadily at the tip of its nose in order to encourage
a similar effect. Australia’s biggest heiress turned
up in a rubbishy-looking dark-blue suit and a lame
black hat trimmed with pink. Contrasting her
appearance with that of poorer but more stylish
women, it really looks as if the worst misfortune
that can happen to a woman, as a woman—from
Daniie right up to date—is a shower of gold.
One spectreish lady had red hair and a
grey suit with a Tattersall - check vest, and
showed the white feather in her hat; and a society
lady, temporarily on crutch-sticks, unwisely wore
a red velvet gown, as if afraid of not attracting
sufficient attention.
The military element is always strong at polo
sports ; and talking of the military reminds me
that whenever a certain spoffish officer had occasion
to don his regimental kilt, he always spent hours
beforehand in a sunny place with his two nude
knees exposed to the glare, trying to get a manly
bronze on ’em for the occasion. It was the same
seasoned old warrior (in a Pickwickian sense) who
attended a ball in the tartan petticoat of Scotland,
and was discovered “ sitting out ” in a corridor of
the Town Hall, with his own handkerchief tied
round one knee and his partner’s round the other 1
He found it “jolly cold,” so he said without
hesitation, though the lady sat uncomplaining in
a slip of a satin bodice and a necklace. But, when
you come to think of it, a lady “sitting out” in
a dark corner always gets sheltered from the
breeze in a most miraculous manner.
The Liedertafel concert at Sydney Town Hall
on the 18th had girls’ voices in the game for the
first time, with the result that the uniqueness of
the society was a shattered thing, and one feels
pleased to record that the choristresses won’t
always be included. The concert suggested the
resurrection of the petered-out Philharmonic —the
ghostly-robed women aiding the effect. The
damsels also suggested a tidal-wave of femininity
which beat the Liedertafel youths right back
against the organ, where they clung in a thin line
like sea-weed. There was a perfect herd of girls.
Evidently, if it takes nine tailors to mi e a man,
it requires ten female voices to balance one male
pipe! I thought it rather ungallant on the part
of the management that they should have burst
out into unwonted decorations. Less trimming
would have been a greater compliment—as it was,
the artistic edging of palms and thick ferns looked
as if the aim was to hide the choristresses’ feet.
I thought the girls sang their one unsupported
item in a painstaking, churchy sort of way,
though, mind you, it was encored ; after which
the Superintendent gave each good little Mary a
bun in a bag—but stop ! I am mixing this notice
with one I mean to give the Y.W.C.A. The
cream of the show was an Italian romance wildly
played by the Liedertafel. It went with a rush
and a swirl like a Melb. Cup set to music. I
wasn’t much impressed with the champion piece,
Olaf Trygvasen. Grief is not to be satisfactorily
interpreted by the first chorus you come across,
and the ’ohestra was too loud for the soloists. A
new baritone, Mr. Noble, debuted. He is a
“ roarer ” —in horsey parlance—his breathing was
beard half-way down the hall, oven if his voice
wasn’t. Edgar Strauss and a pupil played a ’cello
duet with great success, and that was all there
was of the programme. The huge audience wasn’t
altogether up to Sydney Liedertafel standards,
the mixed state of affairs in front being well-
expressed by an agony ad. in a daily next morn-
ing requesting dark gentleman who winked at tall
blonde at the Liedertafel concert to communicate
with Flossie—or words very much to that effect.
The introduction of ladies seems to have a de-
moralising effect.
Ashfield Town Hall was all agog over the per-
formance of “H.M.S. Pinafore” by a strong
band of capable amateurs, stage-managed and
generally shaken up by Miss Josephine Deakin,
who played Josephine in two very special gowns
and a blaze of Parisian diamonds, and sang her
soprano music with professional expertness, Mr.
J. H. Rainford (Dick Dead eye) was the other pro.,,
lending experience and a good bass voice to the
scene. The cast was admirable. Even the tenor
didn’t put in worse acting than his vocal kind are
famous for, and any defects on his part were
amply atoned for by the rest. Mrs. R. Imray
made a jovial gagging Little Buttercup; Mr. W.
B. Beattie sang and acted Captain Corcoran in
tip-top style, his “Fair Moon” solo being one of
the best things in the operetta ; Mr. E. Clarke
was extremely naval as Sir Joseph, and sang his
patter humorously, and Mr. G. E. Weatherill
gave a rollicking sketch of Bill Bobstay. The
voice of the prompter was not heard in the land,
and the show went as smoothly as if the ’teurs
had been playing it for weeks. Mr. Albert Fisher
conducted the evenly-balanced orchestra.
Both Kruse and Hambourg have gone from our
midst, to the sorrow of the truly musical. The
gap will take a lot of filling, and there is a
bad time ahead for mediocrity visiting these
shores. By the way, both Kruse and Hambourg
had a bad time themselves in Sydney in one sense.
The latest society craze is the resurrected birth-
day-book, and all professionals of note suffer
under it. At the last Kruse concert and at Ham-
bourg’s farewell scintillation bevies of decolletd
damsels (Hambourg had 30!) swarmed into the
artist’s room with books, pens, and ink-pots all
ready, and absolutely tore autographs from both
the stars on separate occasions ! That they hadn’t
even been introduced didn’t trouble them one bit.
I doubt if stars are made such game anywhere as
they are here in Australia. Oscillatory demon-
strations occurred at Hambourg‘s finale, though I
haven’t heard of anybody kissing Kruse. There’s
a “ countess ” in his case, for one thing, and then
you can defend yourself better with a fiddle,
which comes in very handy sometimes as a battle-
axe.
The last flutter—Steepiechaseday—of Rand wick
Spring meeting was rather an anxious ceremony,
for there was a stiff nor r -<easter blowing, Bill, and
the many silly women, in flimsies—doctors’ de-
lights they ought to be called -fluttered in the
breeze like frozen scarecrows. The vice-regal
packing-ease had the inevitable mob in it. The
acting-Govarnoress w?lh mostly black velvet cape,
with a lilac bonnet sprouting in a highly modish#*
manner ; the A.Y.R party from Smellbourne sug-
gested a pen-and-ink sketch or a magpie meeting
—all three dressed in black and white. The best-
dressed Melbournienne wore mushroom brocade,
witli splashboards of blue satin and odds-and-ends
of blueohiffon—blue tulle hat with black feathers ;
Mrs. Rupert Oarington again made a sartorial
goose-egg in a floppy gown of «scru muslin ; the
only purple “ patch ” about the badly-worn frock
of the Wealthiest of spinsters was a long-tailed
sash. 1 don’t think anybody over 15 looks
impressive in a sash. Mrs. “Jack” Eales
wore a black silk striped crSpon skirt with
a blouse bodice of white satin and real
lace fixings ; Miss Clibborn, a black skirt
with silk blouse of duck-egg green brocaded with
pink roses, a pink chiffon collar, black and white
hat punctuated with pink roses. And, talking of
hats, the most bizarre topping of the day was a
yellow thing like a sheaf of ripe wheat standing
on its head and trimmed stragglingly with red and
yellow poppies. But the oddest curio on the lawn
was a youth, a very, very fashionable youth,
who, for a time, had bidden his cherished Picca-
dilly “so very much ta,” as the Johnnies
say, in order to quiz the beastly Australians, yer-
knovv. His garments were a hand-me-down fit
with the bifurcations inches too short for grace.
Then his hat was a-cock, his moustache curved
outwards like a bullock’s horns, and last, but by
no means least, the skirts of his coat were as
round and stiff as if they had been built over a
tub. He was an object-lesson in British fashion.
Pretty Miss “ Mark Twain ” attended the
Steeple in a rather tired-looking garment. Mrs.
“Griff’’Jones wore a handsome gown, in which
fawn, brown and strawberry-pink were cleverly
commingled with long fawn gloves to the elbow ;
a portly society woman wisely wore black, but
spoilt the good effect of the paring-down color with
a pair of huge sleeves of a bold pattern, which
made her resemble a captive balloon ; a girl in
Coolgardie “yaller” spotted with black suggested
that the flies had got into the butter, and the trail
of the ingenious Blanche Massey fichu was over a
great many maidens. The feature of the races
was the preponderance of women—women, women
everywhere with not a male to wink, as the poet
almost says. The debutantes stood around,
apparently wondering what on earth mamma had
brought ’em out for, and the enthusiasm with which
women took one another in to afternoon-tea
suggested a tentative experiment in woman’s
right to “shout buns” for her circle. The
visiting contingent came very short of men
this spring—plenty of unsupported petticoats to
add to the already large array on hand locally. I
hear rumors that a well-known society widow of
many thousands is going into double-harness, but
that appears to be all the matrimony on the stocks
—barring the engagement (in Brisbane) of Miss
Finney to an acting aide-de-camp.
“ Ladies’Day,” at Randwick (Thursday), was
remarkable for the absence of bold people on the
Stand. The Jewish Penitential Day was occurr-
ing, and the Chosen were away repenting vigor-
ously. But how short-sighted to fix any event of
a hilarious character without due regard to the
religious exigencies of Hebraism 1 Why on earth
should the Gee-Gees have farewelled on the even-
ing of a Jewish Penitential Day—which day the
dunderheaded A.J.C. committee also fixed upon
to run the Craven Plate 1 A glance round the
Lyceum on any first night will show you what a
monetary loss such want of thought gives rise to 1
The Royal Comic Opera Co. got individually a
warm welcome at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday
from a crowded house full of cackling theatre-
parties of the very best and noisiest people, in-
cluding representatives from Guv’raentouse ; and
everybody felt glad to know that the season of
operatic coherency had dawned again, beginning
with the Frenchy “Ma Mie Rosette,” Although
the co. only arrived from Melbourne at noon the
same day, everybody’s voice seemed to have a
good edge on it. The only serious objection to be
taken to Miss Pollard’s appearance in the pink
garment of “ Rosette ” was that she couldn’t play
Segur at the same time—for though Muriel Carr
filled the part very brightly, yet the faithful can’t
help thinking of Miss P.’s artistic outlines in
those pale-pink hosen. Miss Pollard takes Rosette
very seriously—giving the audience a little too
much back-hair, perhaps, and apparently adding
more petticoats to the part than Nellie did, though
May gets a more graceful effect out of the
bunchy draperies of imminent guilt than Nellie
was wont to extract.
Wallace Brownlow made his usual hawk-like
success of the bold, bad monarch whom Florence
Young (looking very well indeed as Corisandre)
has at last learnt not to address as “ Ongriand
his singing was the feature of the opera. I hear
that Mr. B.’s voice has extended in both direc-
tions since he had his throat trimmed in Sydney.
The opera season is to be one of quick changes of
familiar operas, for the novelty in rehearsal is to
be bottled up for Melbourne Cup-week. By the
time these sapienoies get into print, Miss Flegel-
taub (who is not related to Flo. Young, but is
first cousin or something to a family of well-known
amateur musicians of Sydney) will be cutting
through the air as Clairette Angot.
Writes my Melb. correspondent:—
“ Four Melb. society girls have gone in search
of adventure and novelty to the South Sea
Islands —which seem to have taken the place of
the M.L. Sounds as a fashionable summer-trip.
Interest has been awakened in them by the vivid
stories and sketches of R. L. Stevenson and Louis
Becke.
“Miss Jennings Carmichael debuted as a
lecturess in Melb. the other night, and although
the centre ornament might have been flanked by a
longer introductory address from Alfred Deakin,
on the one side, and a more substantial concert on
the other, the tootonsombull was a mildly dazz-
ling success.
“The poetess, in a simple white gown of crinkly
cr£pon with a spray of wattle-blossom on the
bodice—no jewellery—and her dusky hair daintily
dressed, might have stood for a portrait of the
Bush Spirit as she sees it. Her voice carried well,
and her soulful earnestness seemed to strike young
Australia on a soft place. Jennings Carmichael
talked musically, in prose and verse, of the buslds
better nature. The rising generation cottoned to
the idea that Gordon and Marcus Clarke were
libellers of the joyous gum-tree and the festive
scrub, and when the poetess let herself out on the
subject of the wattle the balcony cried aloud.
“ The Bush Spirit’s resemblance to Lord Hope-
toun’s black-eyed wife was probably her strongest
claim to the Toorak vote. Apropos of the like-
ness, a year or two ago, as Miss Carmichael and a
humble pressman were leaving the Princess’s, a
vigilant flunkey flung open the R’yal-oarriage
dour, prepared to receive Her (vice) Majesty ! The
face ol thernistaken menial as he beheld the lady-
bard walking off witli a common mortal in a cut-
away coat was a thing to remember. For the
moment he feared that his gracious Governoross
was doing a mash,
“ Austral Salonites, for some mysterious reason,
stayed away from ‘The Spirit of the Bush.’ Per-
haps the vision, who is not of this world, worldly,
had managed to bruise the committee’s corn with-
out knowing what she did. All the same, there
were some graceful tributes from the less cul-
chawed masses—areal boomerang trimmed with
Australian flowers, a laurel wreath, and a lyre;
the latter having been ordered by some far-away
Queensland admirers.
“Pianist Hambourg, despite his eye-troubles
and dropsical tendencies, seems more good-natured
than most prodigies. At the end of his first
Melb. visit, he received a letter from a girl of 10,
saying how much she admired his playing and
promising to practise diligently for the next six
years, so that at 16 (Hambourg’s present age) she
might equal his proficiency. The damsel’s reward
was a prompt reply from her hero, who thanked
her for her letter and hoped that on his return to
Melb. she would not only attend his concerts, but
visit the artist’s room, as he was anxious to meet
her.
“ Apropos of the furore aroused by Hambourg’s
rendering of a Chopin polonaise, the story goes
that at the height of the fuss the excited per-
former rushed up to the halo-headed Scherek,
exclaiming rapturously, ‘ Kiss me, kiss me! 1
When the ‘ society ’ conductor refused the caress,
poor little Mark complained tearfully that his
own dear papa wouldn’t have been so unsym-
pathetic. This was too much for Scherek, who
turned away, a prey to the horrid suspicion that
the short-sighted boy, misled by that chic silver
mane, actually regarded him as a contemporary of
Hambourg pere.
“ A Southern Acting-Governor, with a quiver-
ful of buxom daughters, must feel that his guber-
natorial term has been doubly blessed if, as is
generally rumored, both his departing A.sD.C.
are applying to be taken on as sons-in-law.
“At a recent Australian vice-regal ball the
daughters of a very high official ‘ sat down ’ half
the evening. This phenomenon is credited to the
influence of a society league, having for its object
the insulation of the damsels in question until
they recover from the intermittent shortness of
vision and memory to which they are alleged to
have been more or less subject ever since pa’s
accession to power.
“Dr. Kirkland, one of the Catterthun survivors,
ascribes his safety to the strength of his arms.
As the seas dashed over the wreck, it was all he
could do to hold on, and, time and again, he
realised that, with a fraction less muscle-power,
he would have been worsted in the fight. The
unlucky Dr. Anderson, on the other hand, is
described as a fragile young fellow, physically un-
fit to escape from that veritable murder-hole, a
ship’s cabin with its door jammed tight by the
weight of water in the passage outside.
“The Mount Morganaire D’Arcys are faithfu’
to old friends. One of their daughter Lena’s
bridesmaids was Miss Mary Bourcicault, late of
Melb. and formerly of Rockhampton (Q.), tin-
bride’s birthplace. Another was Miss Oe-il
"Nulling, whose mother had been another Miss
Bo.ue cault. Miss Mary Bourcicault, theyoungesi
of l.rt- late editor (of various Queensland journal.-)
Bom cicault’s pretty,ambitious daughters, was ten
dered a benefit concert in Melb. some years ago,
and left to obtain European voice-culture.
“ The Melb. wedding, at which the bridegroom
was 50 years older than his bride, was not sanc-
tioned by the presence of the latter’s father. Th s
incorruptible patriarch carried his opposition i<
the union of May and December to the point of
refusing to engineer marriage-settlements for In.-
daughter, who, nevertheless, took the risk without
apparent anxiety.
“At present debutantes part their well-frizzed
tresses down the centre, droop them slightly over
the ears and finish off with a coil on the back ol
the neck. The fashion of parted hair is chiefly
responsible for the demure Madonna-like expres
sion so noticeable in pictured damsels of the early
thirties, though, to-day, the hallowing effect of
the thin white line is minimised by fluffy ban-
deaux, which represent the sleek ear-weepers of 5U
years agone.
“These hard times it is refreshing to hear of
anyone making money against his will. Such is
the pleasing predicament of an up-country doctor,
whose district includes the native heath of almost
all Victoria’s wealthiest equal ting clans. In addi-
tion to general practice, this favorite of Fortune
receives yearly retainers from local magnates to
ward off disease frjm themselves and families,
which entails weekly visits to the show stations o.‘
the province, with lunch, afternoon-tea, and
dinner engagements for almost every day in
the week. Desirous of more leisure, Medicus a
well-preserved bachelor and effective carpet-
knight—has often engaged assistants, and even
induced rival practitioners to settle in the neigh
borhood, but to no purpose. His patients,
especially the ladies, relentlessly boycott th <
new-comer until he leaves in disgust.
“J. M. Davies, late Minister for Justice, recently
defeated when seeking re-election to the Legisla-
tive Council, suffers from the unpopularity of his
clan. Many people condemn him as part and
parcel of the execrated Matthew ; others con-
fuse him with another brother, J. B. Davies,
whose insolvency led to the recent Molesworth
controversy. Asa matter of fact, the ex-M.L.C.,
the eldest and most weather-beaten of the boom
brothers, has, since the smash, lived in retirement,
and devoted almost the whole of his legal earn-
ings to paying off his enormous calls. So far, he
has made no attempt to seek the shallow water of
Insolvency Harbour, which, at all events, is a
great point in his favor.”
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

It is surprising to hear of that experienced
craftsman, barrister Villeneuve Smith, of Ade-

Many think that Alfred Deakin’s orations
are struck off hot from the anvil of his genius,
But that they are not spontaneous is indicated by

bottled up in his indignant soul in re the Argus
assaults upon his friend and political godparent,
Berry, and Mrs. L). was there to hear it. But the

“The mental faculties,” Countess Wacht-
meister says, “ should not be clouded by the use
of animal food.” And yet her 16 years of vege-
tarianism don’t seem to have cleared the lady up
to the moderate extent of comprehending that
Nature, which does nothing for fun, would hardly
have supplied a purely graminivorous Countess
with flesh-eating teeth and a flesh-assimilating
digestive apparatus.
Prior Vaughan is receiving a rather cool
welcome from the Northern. R.C. clergy—chiefly
because he is not an Irish Catholic, and partly
because he’s a Tory. Whereat a Northern editor,
indignant, revives the story of the Italian priest
on the Hodgkinson whose ministrations were so
badly attended by his Celtic parishioners that he
was finally driven, as a last resource, to paint the
door of his chapel green. Even that ingenious
device failed.
Geo. P. Doolette, according to the cable,
is about to marry Miss Dale, daughter of the Con-
gregational preacher who visited Australia. Doo-
lette, now in London, is an Adelaide man who
made a big rise in Brokens, and sold out at boom-
prices. Then he lost a lot of it as an amateur
pastoralist, but the Brockmans put him on to
Great Boulders, and the erstwhile fashionable
tailor, a rather popular man, is now worth at
least .£lOO,OOO.
Of the men elected in March, ’57,

land), Charles Bonney (the only S.A. pensioner,
now residing in Sydney) and E. Krichauff. In
addition, W. Rogers and H. B. T. Strang-
ways (now in England) were returned at bye-
elections to the same Assembly, which was dis-
solved in March, 1860.
Garrick, vacillating as ever, has finally
declined the Q. Supreme Court Judgeship, after
being gazetted. When Acting-District Court
Judge lie used to hesitate so long over his de-
cisions that the parties found it cheaper to settle
than wait. His place as Agent-General is now
not worth an hour’s purchase. Twice already he
has seen the writing on the wall. His friends are
puzzled as to why a man constitutionally lazy and
with a good income should have gone out of his
way to look for work.
Baron Von Mueller loves to relate how,
when director of Melb. Botanical Gardens, he was
one day accosted therein by a man apparently
chockful of botanical knowledge, which he longed
to impart to the world. Eor some time the
director listened with amazed interest to the
stranger’s original remarks, but when the latter
wound up by declaring that no good could come
to the Gardens until they got rid of that sanguin-
ary old Dutchman who bossed them at present,
the Baron lost his temper: “My vriendt,” he
cried, “I vosh dot blangy old Dudgeman.”
Sydney D.T. found Mark Twain drinking
cocktails at Australia Hotel bar, and reports him
as saying that he used to drink whisky with
lemon and sugar, but now prefers it without these
adjuncts. Platform Rechabites and magazine
anti-liquor writers have been in the habit of
referring to Mark as an example of the intellectual
worker who deprecates stimulants. In “Study
and Stimulants,” an interesting work which
makes good per contra reading to the Baron
Bramwell glorifiers of Bacchus, it is set down that
“ Mark Twain considers two glasses of champagne
an excellent stimulant to the tongue, but never
knew the time when he could write to Ids satisfao-
tion after drinking even one glass of wine.
True ; alcohol is not for work-time, but for after

The most prominent article of furniturt

Mayor Trask,

ber, has been five
times Mayor of
“Sleepy Hollow”
—a place that hae
chiefly a reputation
for having upon one
occasion, when a

sessed a brigade

it was in the middle

Man tell, M.L.C.
(M.L.), who died
the other day, was
the first scientific
explorer of themoa-
beds of Waikouaite
and Waingongaro,
and the British
Museum contains
some of the bones
of his research.
Upon the very
afternoon th at Man -
tell was buried, Pre-
mier Seddon re-
ceived news that a
half-caste, living
about 10 miles from
Otorohanga, had
found a complete
skeleton of a large
moa in a cave. It
is reported to be Oft. high, and every bone in the
skeleton is complete excepting one of the claws.
Dear Bulletin,— Your Judge Barry anec-
dote agrees with the fact that, whereas that model
of deportment was urbanity itself with the unpre-
tentious person, he was promptly down upon the
slightest vestige of “frill” —upon anybody but
himself! The “ futile and interminable ” Slack v.
Winder case got an unexpected show once, because
the opposing counsel called it so. “That is for
me to say, sir ! ” snapped Sir Redmond. “Go on,
Mr. Slack ! ” And the inexhaustible Slack went
on, rejoicing, for five mortal hours. “Judge
Barry,” the afterwards-murdered Slack used to
say, “is sui generis —he’s a lawyer and a gentle-
man ! ” —A.M.
A septuagenarian Victorian mining mag-
nate and capitalist was married last week to a
young lady, say, half-a-century his junior. The
bridegroom attended the ceremony in the old.
dingy, black, shiny suit which has served him so
long and faithfully, and immediately the final “ I
will” was spoken he limped off to a directors
meeting, leaving his blushing bride to the
care of her bridesmaids for the next couple of
hours. That’s the sort of man to become a mil-
lionaire ; the average poor devil who places his
pleasure before his business generally dies leaving
14 children to share a hypothecated .£lOO life-
policy.
Andrew Luke Byrne, a native of Sydney
aged 64 years, was buried at Rookwood on Sun-
day. The father of deceased lies buried in the
R.C. Cemetery, Devonshire-street, Sydney, and
on his tomb may be read :
To the memory of Andrew Byrne,
Who died April 22, 1863,
Aged 89 years.
He was born in Wicklow, Ireland, and arrived in thit
colony as a patriot of his country in the year 1800.
Which means that Andrew Byrne took part in the
Irish rising of 1798, and, with many others, was
exiled to Botany Bay without even the formality
of a trial.
From The Author re Mark Twain :—“li
is an open secret that Mr. Clemens has lost most
of his own fortune and part of his wife’s by the
failure of Charles L. Webster and Co. He has
also sunk thousands of dollars in an invention
from which it is not expected that he will get a
penny. The American papers used a few year*
ago to make fabulous statements as to the magni-
tude of the fortune Mark Twain had earned by
his books. They used to speak of two millions of
dollars. Certainly the humorist lived in splendid
style at Hartford, in Connecticut, where he was a
neighbor of Charles Dudley Warner. It is, how-
ever, beyond dispute that Mark Twain made
more by his pen than any other American
author. Success had an unusual effect upon
this creator of a nation’s smiles. It soured him.
He got a name for taciturnity. He would sit
smoking big cigars for hours on end without en-
riching the surrounding flow of reason with s
single remark. He used to tell his most intimate
friends that his happiest days were those he spent
as a pilot on board a Mississippi boat. His periods
of clowning and gold-digging were also productive
of good digestion and even temper. Now that
Mark Twain has to buckle to again he may re-
sume Ids old cheerfulness. There is no living
lecturer to surpass him in the interest of his per-
sonality or the engaging nature of his diction.
He is still handsome, with a splendid head set on
square shoulders, a deep chest, keen, quick
moving eyes, and hair that has been silvered by
the labors that the world has laughed at.”

NOVEL METHOD OF HUNTING.
(moil OUB COESEftPOITDENT. I
Q . DUBBO, Thursday.
Sciilp-hunting has reached such act extent that
the directors of the Pastoral Board notify that no
fee will in future be' paid for any scalps exeept
natiye dog scalps. The board has just paid for
16,000 scalps month. Numbers of men are
employed on stations shooting kangaroos and
wallabies. Some kangaroo shooters use bicycles
and shoot with rifles. They go full speed, and
then make a circuit round the escaping mob, and
get other shots. The shooters can go full speed
through timber, though there are broken limbs
of trees on the ground.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Angus Cameron—“ Anxious” Cameron.
App’int Maloney. Also, De Pentheny
O’Kelly.
William M‘Millan, M.P., evidently aims
at becoming the Jimmy Service (Vic.) of N.S.W.
Things seem to be moving towards a per-
manent Russo-Chinese alliance against England
and Japan—land-powers v. sea-powers.
The anomaly of having the Chief Justice
as Acting-Governor is shown in the announcement
that Darley, C.J., will preside at next Sydney
criminal sittings.
Little Cowley, the incapable Q. Speaker,
is having a “ bad time.” He has quite lost control
of the House, and is even bullied by his god-
fathers on the front Ministerial bench.
When will the Reid Tariff be?
In the Greek Kalends,
When the last male ends.
Then will the Reid Tariff be.
Mark Twain’s “instinct teaches him that
Protection is wrong ! ” A man’s instinct teaches
him a good many things that he has afterwards
carefully to unlearn with the help of his reason—
when he has any !
Trenwith has too much brain and equa-
nimity ever to become the revolutionary leader that
some followers would like him to be. Witness his
conduct at the Snowden meeting in Melb. Town
Hall the other night.
S.A. public service reduction —increased
this year—will have the support of the Parlia-
mentary country party to avoid an increased
land-values tax. Labor M’s.P. solidly oppose,
as the reductions hit the large staff of railway
men.
Everybody starts to howl when a “lay”
politician gets preferment like that which has
come to George Dibbs, but it seems to be taken as
quite natural that political lawyers should be
raised (practically by themselves) to lucrative
judgeships. Why ?
Castlemaine, Yic., has a zoological curio-
sity in the shape of an eccentric duck that persists
in laying black eggs. The Bulletin takes it that
the black ball is an intelligent duck’s most
energetic protest against the member for Castle-
maine, J. Beef Patterson.
Premier Reid alleges that the proposal to
borrow money for the purpose of thinning forests
is “supported by the best authorities.” (“The
best grandmothers!” interjected Lyne.) Question :
Who are the best authorities on the subject of
thinning out forests with borrowed money ?
There is friction between Premier Turner
and the Yic. Defence Department in re the ap-
pointment of an adjutant to the Mounted Rifles.
The Dept, has nominated an officer; Turner
refuses to sanction the appointment. Now it is
known in well-informed military circles that the
officer nominated is Lieut. George Patterson—J.
Beef Patterson’s nephew. See ?
The river Murray al-
tered its channel recently,
taking a short line across the
neck of a peninsula on the
Southern side, and shifting
a good-sized piece of Vic-
toria into N.S.W. It cut
right across a cattle-station,
and left half the bullocks in
N.S.W., and now the owner
is expected to pay stock-
duty on the animals when he
brings them across, and as
he states that he will see the
Government boiled first, or
something to that effect, the
matter has been referred to
Melbourne for decision.
Also, there is a serious diffi-
culty about collecting taxes
on tiie escaped territory, and
the complication has grown
so bad that the Works De-
partment is taking steps to
shift the river back again.
The Cabbage Garden can’t
afford to lose any territory
these times.
Maoriland is thinking
of shutting down on her Old
Soldiers for good and all. It
is m arly 30 years now since
the last. Maori war ended,
and still the old soldiers, the
deserters, the men who were
run out of the army for mis-
conduct, the men who were
never in it at all, and the
gaudy veterans who served
in tin* forces but were never
within 200 miles of the scene
of action, keep dropping in
to collect their land-grant.
Most of the genuine warriors
got their grants long ago,
and the applicants who come
along now are mainly bogus.
The Government has rejected 1500 military im-
postors of various degrees, and, after this year, it
will probably enact that the business is definitely
iilused.
South Australia proposes to square its
finances by reducing civil service salaries to the
extent of .£30,000; taking .£15,000 off road main-
tenance; making the municipalities pay .£7OOO
towardsthesupportofthe police force; and stopping
the annual payment of <£60,000 in reduction of the
public debt.
The impending reduction of S.A. Gover-
nors’ salary from .£5OOO to £4OOO will, if it becomes
law, place Gov. Buxton in a peculiar position. It
is a rule of the Colonial Office that all posts in the
Empire carrying salaries of <£sooo and upwards
rank as first-class, while those carrying less are
second-class—and so on.
Michael Davitt—who had a private con-
ference with the N.S.W. solidarity Labor-party,
the other day, about which, so far, nothing has
appeared in the jiapers—is absolutely delighted
with the S.A. village settlements on the Murray,
and strongly urges all benevolent politicians to
become acquainted with them.
Education Minister Dalrymple had the
audacity to deny the other day that Queensland
possessed any other piebalds than aboriginals. A
visit to some of the elementary schools in the
North would show him that numbers of half-bred
Chinese children (clever ones, too) partake of the
blessing of free, secular and compulsory education.
Saturday’s announcement that certain of
the Gilbert and other South Sea islands are to
remain closed against recruiting till further
notice, really reduces to fact the suggestion of
Cecil Wilson, Bishop of Melanesia, who, in April
last, advised the appointment of close seasons for
certain islands to preserve the human game from
being exterminated.
N.S.W. Comptroller-General of Prisons
strikes out boldly in his classification of fiist-
offending subjects for the ideal of Australia
against the world. The “ colonial yard ”at Dar-
lingliurst he reserves wholly for Australian
natives, while into the “ foreign yard ” he dumps
English, Irish, Scotch, Welsh, French, Chinese
and all other nationalities.
At Townsville (Q.) a frantic Mayor
threatened to send for the police to shift an alder-
man who sp.ike of the Governor as “Mr. Nor-
man.” He didn't really send for them, however,
so it remains legally undecided whether it is a
felony in the Far North to speak of the Gov. as if
he were an ordinary person, and whether grovel
is compulsory under the Constitution.
“Paddy” Glynn, 8.A., who entered S.A.
Parliament as a Land Nationaliser in 1887, and
who was defeated, in 1890 and 1893, because he
still advocated the Georgian doctrines, was one
of the principal speakers at the National >->ss
meeting at Adelaide, Sept. 14. As a good
R.O. and a loyal Home Ruler he will look
beautiful behind the yellow (gold-color) rosette
which is now the badge of the Ass.
Railway Commissioner Eddy’s re-engage-
ment is a remarkable arrangement. N.S.W. i
bound to retain him for seven years at .£3OOO a
year, if he wants to be retained, but lie can depart
at any time on giving six months’ notice. Also,
he is to have a “ long holiday ” after four years’
service. Probably the proposed <£4ooo a year,
with a definite engagement on both sides and no
long holiday, would have been cheaper.
Attention was drawn in Bananaland Par-
liament the other day to the circumstance that it
is not the Japanese coolie who is to be feared, but
the free immigrant Jap, who leaves his country
on his own account just the same as a free Euro-
pean. Even the Northern Fat Men seem afraid
of the Japs, one of them summing up the situation
thusly:—“Our danger comes not so much from
the Japanese serf as from the competition of
Japanese capital.” Thursday Island has taught
them this.
Miss JOSEPHINE THYNNE (Mrs. Harry Plimmer).
Australian Parliaments are full of unsuc-
cessful parsons—who make conspicuously poor
legislators. The fact is that p ilitioians were left
out of the estimate for gulden halm s—and, of
course, every parson aspires most diligently to the
heavenly coronet. Couldn't.wo take example by
the most democratic country on earth (Switzer-
land), and keep these holy persons completely out
of the contamination of politics?
If N.S.W. ex-Minister Slattery can abso-
lately disprove the charges made against him
before the Civil Service Commission re the ap-
pointment as inspectors of agriculture of useless
drunks and political friends of a shady character,
who hardly knew a vegetable by sight, he should
set about it at once. If he can’t, he should be
declared incapable of again sitting in Parliament,
or holding any political office; and any other
members of the Dibbs-Slattery Cabinet who can
be shown to have concurred in the smellful pro-
ceeding should be similarly dealt with.
“ LOVE IS BLIND"
A George-street (Sydney) street-scene.
A deputation of Sydney unemployed re-
presented to Premier Reid last week that their
class now numbers between 15,000 and 20,000 men.
N.S.W. Parliament appointed a committee 36
years ago to ascertain the number of local unem-
ployed, and 3000 were found to be so circum-
stanced. Then old man Parlies, who presided
over the committee, invaded the Assembly, and
yelled with such effect that Parliament resolved
“that something must be done.” Henry Parkes
followed that up by saying that the something
should be “a moderate system of Protection to
native industries. ”
Says Melbourne Punch, in a complaint
about the anti-sweating meeting at Melb. Town
Hall; “The agitator is a man who is never
satisfied.” Also, it is worth adding, everybody
else is a man who is never satisfied. Further,
everybody is agitating, more or less energetically,
for something. The term “agitator,” however, is
only applied to the man who wants something for
the masses. When Fat Man agitates for a sub-
sidy, or a new loan, or for State assistance for his
crumbling bank, or for a railway, or Imperial
Federation, or anything large or grovelsome, he
isn’t an agitator. An agitator, in short, is the
other fellow.
Chaffey Baker, M.L.0., presiding genius
of S. A. Toryism, doesn’t feel comfortable. In ’B9,
when the Trades Hall Bill was before S. A. Legis-
lature, Baker and his Ass colleagues violently
opposed a State grant. To make it clear his
motives were above suspicion, Baker said, on
Dec. 4, ’B9 : “lam willing to help this section by
giving .£5O, and I am willing to guarantee that I
will collect £lOOO from members of Parliament if
this Bill is lost, and if I do not do this I will pay
the guaranteed amount myself.” The Bill was
rejected accordingly. Chaffey’s pledge is em-
balmed in the pages of S.A. Hansard, and
although six years have elapsed only .£560 of the
amount promised has been received from Baker’s
friends. As the trades-unionists are now erecting
the hall they are anxious to know when Baker is
going to pay up.
The wholesale contempt now poured upon
N.S.W. Supreme Court could not have come to
pass had Governor Oarington been anything but a
glorified stable-boy with his eyes and ears ever
opim for public applause. At the Mount Rennie
time lie personally held the absolute prerogative
of mercy, and if, instead of smilingly receiving
the brutal Sydney Exchange deputation which in
his ignorance he took to represent public opinion
and which insulted himself and his office by
ashing him, in as many words, to hang the boys
of whose fate he was the final arbiter, he had
been a man imbued with a sense of what was
due to justice, and had sat down and written
iu the minutes of the Executive Council that he
declined to take the advice of his Ministers and
would not be guilty of slaying even a mangy dog
condemned after such a trial, he would have
sponged out Judge Windeyer and the miserable
legal ring who to-day einbastion that official. Who
can expect Opposition leader Lyne, of the Mount
Rennie Cabinet, and the present Attorney-
General Want, who was also of the Mount Rennie
Cabinet, to directly censure themselves by
now doing what is emphatically their duty towards
the Mount Rennie Judge ?
The Argus is pleased with Vic. Railway
Board for recommending the reduction of rail-
way laborers’ wages to a the rates
ruling outside the department. The rates ruling
outside are anything from half-a-crown a day up
to 6s. The practice in America, says the con-
servative organ, is to pay railway employes less
than the ruling rate in consideration of the regular
employment. Fortunately, every citizen who is
not a railway employe hopes to be one, so that it
is not probable that the railway men will be re-
duced to subsisting upon the departmental waste.
Melbourne Ar-
gus, which always
raves against every
Victorian industry
in the interests of
the importers, has
systematically de-
nounced the local
coal as compara-
tively worthless,
and urged the use
of the Newcastle
product on the
(State railways. The
Koinmburra Coal
Co. now suggests
that the Premier
shall appoint an
officer who shall
send ten tons each
of Korumhurra and
Newcastle coal to
the Tasmanian
Railway Commis-
sioner, whose report
on their relative
merits shall be ac-
cepted as final. The
coal co. offers to
hack its product for
<£so, and asks the
Argus to bet a
similar amount on
the imported fuel,
the loser’s money to
go to Melb. Hospi-
tal. So far the
Argus hasn’t been
heard from on the
subject. This ex-
treme confidence in
Vic. coal certainly
surprises N.S.W,
The Ass crowd
in S. A. Legislative
Council recently
worked a smart
point. The ad-
journed debate on
the second reading
of the Employers’
Liability Bill was
called on, and a
Tory speaker was
about to continue;
noticing, however,
that Kirkpatrick and Bice, M.’sL.C., were out of
the chamber, another Ass member stopped the
speaker hurriedly, and the second reading was
put and lost by 9 votes to 8.
At the settling after the ’94 N.S.W. general
election a country returning-officer could not stand
his deputies being paid for their services, whilst
nothing came his way save honor. However,
having a Govt, cheque-book, he thought he would
endeavor to mend this injustice, and drew and
cashed a cheque in his own favor for £5O. When
a statement of accounts was sent, “head-quarters ”
asked him to explain. He explained—and had to
refund the <£so.
The forest-thinning industry has been
already started on a large scale in N.S.W., so if
Parliament makes any difficulty about passing the
Loan Bill it will be told that the money is already
spent, and it has no voice in the matter. It is
intended to have about 400 men on the job—it is
indeed a job—by the end of next week, and the
Labor Bureau is to send another 300. The maxi-
mum wage will be 7s. per day. As Varney Parlies
says : “ Why not spend <£200,000 at once, and ask
the sanction of Parliament afterwards? ”
Sydney Daily Telegraph declares it is
the duty of N.S.W. Government to have the Par-
liamentary motion of want of confidence in Justice
Windeyer discussed instantly :
To dispose of the question is an obligation which cannot
be put off. It requires instant fulfilment, as one of the
most serious and urgent that a Government can under-
take.
The fact is that Judge Windeyer, the best lawyer
in N.S.W. and the worst judge south of the
Equator, is passively supported by the N.S.W
legal ring; though most of the members thereof
don’t love him they are afraid to say so. Their
sober sentiments in the matter are very
much like those of the historical Brown,
who, when drunk and off his guard one day
met his life-long chum, Smith. “Look here, old
man,” he said, “we’ve been friends for many
years, but I—hie!—never liked'you.” Judge
Windeyer’s strength has lain and lies in his thick
skin and his uniform aggressiveness. He is the
Pie Biter of the Bench-the great American Pie
Biter, it will be remembered, had a hand like a
whale’s ear, and when he reached out for a pie
that was his pie. His Honor has hitherto reached
out for everything he fancied—and he has got it,
from the N.S.W. Attorney-Generalship to the
Chancellorship of the University. But, spoilt by
success, he has presumed too far on public endur-
ance. No Government would now dare to
make Judge Windeyer Chief Justice of N.S.W.,
and no Australian Parliament would dare to
vote money to pay him a salary as an Australian
representative on the Privy Council.

A DISEASE, not a CRIME.
The constant abuse of alcohol fosters a crave—
a crave insatiable and deadly. It deprives valu-
able men of all reason and respect; it drives them
to acts of indecency and crime, and to drink what
their palates may even repel. At this stage
pledges and punishment prove useless, and
physical, as well as mental attention, is urgently
required.
The Orient Institute
has established a wonderful reputation in the
curing of this awful disease, and, during the past
18 months, many prominent men of our colony
have been restored to health, sobriety and
position. Alcoholic stimulants become not only
unnecessary, but, in the majority of cases, un-
palatable. Patients undergo no inconvenience or
restraint, and are free to eat and drink what they
like.
UNQUESTIONABLE TESTIMONY.
“I had heard of the excellent results attending your
work, and was thereby induced to send my friend to you.
The results have exceeded my most sanguine expect )tions.
F >r the previous five years he has always been under the
influence of alcohol and gradually losing power to resist
it. Since he lias been under your treatment a marvellous
change has been wrought in him. Not only does he
appear to he thoroughly cured of drinking, but his
appearance, which had been degenerating, has improved,
and ids color is healthy and bright. In short, the man
seems not only to have been purged of disease, but also
renewed mentally and physically.”
R. M. Me. ANDERSON, 38 Pilt-St.
“I s nit a gentleman to Mr. Thomas for treatment in
April, 1894—about the worst case I ever knew—and the

Parsonic scorn for the girl who rides a
bike, or a trike, is not to be wondered at. If she
made a point of dashing up to the sanctuary on
the godless vehicle, Rev. Obadiah would gladly
give it shelter in the porch—but she doesn’t. The
wheelwoman is a brazen Sabbath-breaker, who
flaunts her knickers abroad when she ought to be
saying her prayers, and represents a clear loss of
threepence a week to the Cause.

INDIGESTION
And Liver Complaint
CURED BY USING
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkerville, S. Australia, writes:
“ Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and 1
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; it helped me from the first,—in fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep like
a child.”
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
"It Is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to toll you of the
great benefit my little daugh
ter Gladys has derived from
‘ Monger's Food.’ The docloi
and all who saw her though 1
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Benger’s
Food ’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
“If every mother knew of
.ts value no other would be
used.”
Hamilton (Vic.) cannery buys 20,000 pairs
rabbits weekly, and turns out about 5000 tins of
bunnies daily. It employs in all 80 men and boys.
London and Glasgow are the chief markets. The
Euroa factory turns out about 12,000 cases per
annum.
The Maoriland acclimatisation societies
have done splendid work in stocking the rivers
with trout and the country with deer, quad,
partridge, pheasant, &c. The Southland society
is now trying to acclimatise the opossum, having
liberated 25 at Milford Sound and 35 on Stewart
Island.
Up Hughenden way some of the squatters
have turned scalpers. One man three weeks ago
netted 180 kangaroo scalps at Is, 6d. per scalp—
£l2 for seven days’ sport. In drought-times this
pays better than trying to keep life in starving
sheep ; and besides —the bank mostly owns the
sheep, and the scalp-money is “bunce.”
Ed. Bulletin, —A frequent theme of dis-
cussion in the North is the Southern limit of the
alligator. The writer has it upon excellent
authority that the various creeks flowing out in
the vicinity of the “Narrows” (Central Queens-
land) form the Southern boundary of Alligator-
laud. Would some Bulletin reader inform me
is this correct ? —P. Luftig.
In another column appears the advt. of
Mr. W. Mentiplay, of the Botanic Institute,
Bourke-street, Melbourne. Mr. Mentiplay claims
that he has achieved many remarkable cures in
the treatment of various diseases, and his claims
are backed up by published testimonials from a
large number of patients. The medicines sold at
the Botanic Institute are guaranteed to be of
purely vegetable origin, and have an extensive
sale throughout Australia.*
Eight Hours Day, the date of Labor’s
great annual demonstration, draws near, and so
far the carnival of 7th October, 1895, promises to
easily break the record for magnificence, good as
that record is. A very large number of entries
have been received for the sports events, and the
railway arrangements for the day will be as per-
fect as expert management can make them. The
committee has engaged Mr. T. A. Kennedy, the
fearful and wonderful mesmerist, to entertain
holiday-makers at the Town Hall in the evening.
The attention of country ticket-purchasers is
specially drawn to the fact that they can send
postal notes or stamps and receive their face value
by return mail.*
Dear Bulletin, —Can you match this
true instance of presence of mind? Years ago I
was standing by a deep, narrow pool talking to my
mate. He had a heavy “ spud ”in his hand. He
turned to go without thinking, and fell 10ft. into
the pool. Neither of us could swim, but before I
had collected my wits, he crawled out on the other
side, 12yds. away. He said afterwards he knew
he must drown if he tried to swim, but he had
seen divers stop under water a minute, and he
knew he could hold his breath longer than most.
He knew also that the weight of the potato would
counteract the buoyancy of his body. So he shut
his mouth, held his breath and the potato, and
crawled along the bottom to the other side. —
Verity.
Dear B., —Tu a recent Bulletin Mr.
H. J. M'Cooey scornfully snorts at the alleged
botanical inaccuracies of bush bards generally ;
instancing his remarks by allusion to “an im-
posiible and indiscriminate jungle” of various
timbers mentioned in a fragment of my verse
which yon recently published. I now beg to in-
form him that 05 miles east of Barringun, and on
the smith side of the Q. Border-fence, is a 3 x
paddock on Mr. J. Ryan’s “ Wycheproof ” block ;
where, amongst oth r varieties of timber, blood-
wood, box and pine are fairly abundant. Also, in
this same paddock are three myall trees. How
these last came there I don’t know, as they are
not usually found in that soit of country, although
plenty of myall grows twenty miles away. Pos-
sibly they were planted long ago, by a far-seeing
Providence, for so suitable and patriotic a purpose
as the cock-sure naturalist suggests, i.e. that he
may “hang himself on either!” Moreover, I
have ridden in half of a summer’s day, from the
late Charley Norman’s homestead “Morendali”
into Walgett town, and from that track (which
runs from the Narran to the Barioon, via Gom-
borrah Springs) those trees mentioned in “In
Such a Night ” may, with a score of other sorts,
be seen at various intervals of the journey.
There are myalls and bloodwood sufficient to cre-
mate the whole M’Cuoey clan If the captious
M/Cooey will really keep his word, I will gladly
lend him a greenhide rope wherewith to do the
trick.— The Breaker.
Rabbiters on “big” Clarke’s station used
to get .£1 a week, food, powder and shot. Now
the work is done for nothing—but the rabbits.

Queen Victoria was not at all angry with
the ancient Duke of Argyle for getting married a
third time. She gave the bride, who had been
one of her mature maids-of-honor, a choice assort-
ment of wedding presents, and congratulated her
heartily on having found an old man to take care
of.
Constable Crowe, of Fitzroy (VicQ, com-
piler of the alleged “Australian slang dictionary ”
has also turned out a technically useful publication
called “Manual on the duties of a Constable.’’
In this Tittle book the heavy policeman who
doesn’t know any more law than a J.P. is told
what to do on every conceivable emergency.
Many policemen have just sufficient brains to ring
the tirebell as soon as they hear of a distressing
case of refusing to pay for alcohol, and this book
tells them that the procedure aforesaid is very,
very incorrect.
Dear Bulletin, —Re “ W.’s ” letter anent
original Broken Hill holders. My note referred
to the men of the Barrier, not to original holders
of the big mine. Consequently “ W.’s ” remarks
beg the question. I said, and say again, that the
prizes of mining are generally not to the men who
do the work ; that to the Wilsons and the Horns
and the M'Gregors and the M'Oullochs belongs a
success partly fallen over in the dark, and
partly gained by their possession of a capital
to trade with and a vast ability for doing
nothing enthusiastically and breathing with
regularity; whereas “ W.” would lead us
to believe that the Wilsons and the Horns
put the big lode where it is and then discovered it
before it was lost. Long before the Proprietary
was known, there were the Day Dream, the Hen
and Chickens, the Apollyon, and the Bonanza
mines around the old Thackaringa, and with the
h-orn silver days of the field are inseparably con-
nected Sully and Reid. Reid started his paper
under heart-breaking circumstances and condi-
tions, and he and Sully, who never stopped the
shop ” to hard-up prospectors, deserve more
that which they got than does any capitalist or
moneyed worker the field ever knew. When you
get down to such primitive conditions as the con-
ditions of a mining-camp, the capitalist is at a
discount and the muscle of a strong man is gold.
So in all successful mining fields labor more than
cash makes the success, and he who toils the
hardest and the longest is infinitely more deserv-
ing of his win than he whose “ graft ” was repre-
sented by a cheque-book.— The Reckless.

“ The Banjo’s ” book of verses will be out
in about a fortnight. From the appearance of the
sheets, the volume should be very smart-looking
indeed.
The late Bishop of Winchester (Dr.

The latest extension of the penny-in-the-
slot idea is the “cure-all.” There are slots for
about 50 ailments. You put a penny into the
slot marked “ bruise ” and you get a tiny phial of
arnica, and you put another into the “liver”
compartment and out rolls a sugar-coated pill.
In the slow-going old city of Perth (W.A.)
there are no street numbers. Perth, till quite
recently, was a kind of overgrown village where
everybody knew everybody else, and his business,
and all about him, and the authorities can’t under-
stand that these petrified days are gone for good.
In the West Indies, if you offer a friend a
light from your cigar, on no account knock the
ash off. It is a deadly insult. And in Peru, be
exceedingly careful not to pour out wine for a lady
without rising from your seat, wherever you may
be. A challenge from her nearest male relation
follows at once. So, at least, a South American
paper says.
Under the heading of “Peculiar Case of
Assault ” the Argus reports the fracture of a
woman’s skull by her lady companions through
her refusal to “shout” threepenn’orth of beer.
Anyone, though but superficially acquainted with
the usages of Australian ladies on washing-day
would know that such reprehensible meanness
could have but one termination.
“ Peculiar charge of bigamy ” is how the
papers describe the case of a Richmond (Vic.)
man who, according to the charge laid against
him, had a wife and seven children. He married
another wife, and went to live quite close to the
residence of his first family. He paid the parson
who married him to his second wife with a value-
less cheque. Then he was run in on a charge of
false pretences, and both wives came to weep over
him in the lock-up, and naturally they met and
explained things to each other, and after that the
trouble began in real earnest. The man who takes
his second wife to live almost next door to his first
one is a person of such desperate valour that it
seems a pity he should get into gaol instead of
being publicly decorated by the Governor.
“The caddie is an indispensable adjunct
to the golf-player, and something new in caddies
has just appeared in the links at San Francisco.
Miss Dent has two Formosa apes which are
thoroughly broken to the r6le of caddies. They
wear liveries of white duck, and each has a small
Turkish fez.” “ Scotty the Wrinkler ” has it from
Scotland that lady-golfers are hated by profes-
sional caddies because they tip too meanly, and
one was even heard to say (he was a Highlander),
“Maybe the saxpence wull no pay for the whusky
your leddyship trank fae’ ma flesk. ’’ Perhaps the
honor of being attendant to and shouting for a
real “ leddy ” is considered payment enough.
Gamekeepers often refuse point-blank to attend
she-shootists ; although gillies like the lady-
stalker, just on the off-chance of what has been
and will be—an elopement.
The S.M. Herald again lifts up its voice
against free education. N.S.W. raises .£70,000 a
year from school fees, and the Herald states that
it is “quite unaware” of any public demand for
the abolition of this impost. This may be true,
but it is equally true that there was never any
public demand for free newspaper postage, which
is probably as heavy a tax on the people as the
abolition of the school-fees would be. And the
public money is much better spent in removing
the last barriers to the spread of knowledge than
in subsidising the daily ’orror with the full details
of the disembowelled female who was found in
Woolloomooloo, or the shopkeeper’s catalogue re-
gistered as a newspaper. Victoria has reversed the
cornstalk method by levying postage on the tale
of the disembowelled female and making education
absolutely free to everybody, and its neighbor
should follow suit.
Dear Bulletin, —It wasn’t the late in-
spector Duffy who shot Gibson, the murderer of
senior-sergeant Wallings. Two of Mr. Duffy’s
troopers were camped one night near the War-
rego, with an aboriginal murderer in custody,
when Gibson, alias Midnight, rode up to the
camp. Being challenged and fired upon he left
hurriedly, leaving his packhorse, with all firearms,
in the possession of the police, who guaranteed
their black prisoner a free pardon to faithfully
follow the outlaw’s tracks. The shooting of
“Midnight,” together with his horse, a valuable
stallion, Sir William, stolen from a Coonamble
squatter, appears not to have been absolutely
necessary under the circs. Inspector Duffy was
in charge of the Warrego district at that time.
This inglorious affair evidently furnished Rolf
Boldrewood with material for the finale in his
“ Robbery Under Anns,” where Starlight and his
thoroughbred, Rainbow, was shot on the War-
rego.—Chevron.
“ Apropos the Curse of Deeming,” writes
a Bulletin correspondent, “ it may be of interest
to mention that a large firm of Melb. jewellers
with whom he had extensive dealings had to pay
a fine of, I think, £l5OO to the Customs the other
day for fraudulent entries. A Melb. ironmongery
which he favored with his custom has not
prospered for some time past. Gov. Shegog, of
Melb. Gaol, who presided at his hanging, was
thrown from a buggy soon after, and has not since
recovered from the shock. Deputy-Gov. Foy, who
had the responsibility of looking after Deeming
when in prison, shortly after succumbed to a brain
trouble; and hangman Jones did not live to place
the rope on the neck of another client. Warder
Hogan, who kept the gate at the gaol, was plunged
into ruin after Deeming’s death through the bank
smash. Even Marshall Lyle will tell you that his
connection with Deeming lost him more business
than the notoriety of the case ever brought him.
The two journalists and the artist who set out on a
provincial tour with a Deeming panorama fell on
hard times. No one would go to see the thing, which
they hawked about the country in a spring cart;
and the horse, as soon as he knew what he was
dragging after him, refused to go any further.
When whipped for insubordination, the animal
sent his heels through the splash-board, and bolted
along a country road till he collided with a tree
and emptied the panorama and its proprietors
into a water-hole. A pianist, who was also of the
party, has not been able to strike a note since.
Lastly, Shiels, who as Premier and Attorney-
General had the fixing-up of Deeming’s death-
warrant, has been in a chronic state of bad health
for the past two years ; while detective Considine,
who had charge of the Windsor murder-case and
tracked Deeming down, succumbed to a bad cold
only a few days ago. Where, I would like to
know, is the curse going to stop? Why not have
a day of humiliation and prayer and ask Provi-
dence to arrest the mischief ? ”
Item of fashionable intelligence—“ The
Duchess of Teok is a frequent visitor at Mrs.
Richards’ house. Mr. Richards is the enterpris-
ing owner of Carter’s Little Liver Pills.” Every-
thing comes to the man who runs a successful
liver-pill.
The old Duke of Gampridge, one is tired
of reading in the “ loyal ’’press, “always had the
good of the Service at heart.” How superfluous.
Every member of every Royal Family wishes the
local Army well, and prays that its days may be
long in the land. No army, no monarchy.
Henry Lawson’s book, which may be
called “ Block and Backblocks : Australian Verses
by Henry Lawson,” or something of the sort, will
be out shortly and will, like “ Banjo’s ” (orders
for which are rapidly flowing in), be a handsome
volume printed in new type on fine paper. The
price will be ss. 6d., post free from this office, and
The Bulletin, after seeing the material of which
the book is composed, has no hesitation in saying
that it deserves to be, and will be, an immediate
and permanent success.
“ This is the true&nd natural principle of
clothing.” Thus says the Lancet of cellular cloth
clothing. The manner in which cellular cloth is
woven reproduces, on a large scale, the construc-
tion of the pores of the skin. The two sides are
not alike —the side that is worn next to the skin
being open work, while the other side is partially
closed by fine threads—thus the body is sur-
rounded by cells of non-conducting air. The
agents for Victoria, Messrs. Hicks, Atkinson and
Sons, of Melb., state the cellular cloth is be-
coming very generally used for underwear, and is
invariably appreciated, as it possesses many ex-
cellent qualities in addition to its healthy attri-
butes—amongst which not the least are economy
and cleanliness.*
Sydney Telegraph, in its leading article
of Sept. 18, urges the N.S.W. Legislative Council
to compromise on the Land-tax difficulty by strik-
ing out the exemptions. If it does, The Bulletin
devoutly hopes chat the Assembly will reinstate
them and fight out the question to the bitter end,
whatever that may be. A Land-tax which falls
in equal proportion on the miserable little selector
with 50 acres and on the huge landholder wich
40,000 or more may be a profitable revenue-pro-
ducing device. But it will entirely miss its real
object, or what should be its real object—the dis-
couragement of the big rack-renting monopolist
and the foreign land-syndicate, and the encourage-
ment of the small, independent agriculturist.
Moreover, when the Reid Ministry went to the
country at last election its programme distinctly
included the exemptions, and if it got any distinct
mandate on the subject of the Land-tax, that
mandate included the exemptions, and it can no
more go back on them without absolute treachery
than it can go back on the tax altogether, or on
Freetrade, or on Upper House reform.
THE GOOD SLEEP OF A BAD MAN.
'ln a certain prison that we all have heard of lay
a convict upon his narrow iron cot. He was to be
hanged the next morning. Yet he lay there,
covered by a rough blanket, sleeping as quietly
and soundly as a tired schoolboy. Occasionally
the guard in the passage outside peered between
the bars of the cell, only to find his charge breath-
ing deeply and regularly. This man had violated
the law prohibiting murder ; yet he had not vio-
lated the physical laws governing his own body,
and nature rewarded him as if he had been the
noblest of his race.
That same night, less than a mile away, a rich
man tossed and tumbled upon his luxurious bed.
He was a good and useful member of society, yet
he could not sleep. And, worse still, this hap-
pened to him every night. Sleep—that blessing
which the Psalmist says, “God giveth his
beloved,’’ was practically a stranger to this man.
What ailed him? The tortures of conscience?
Want of money ? The fear of enemies ? Nothing
of the sort. Then why didn’t he sleep as well as
the murderer ? You would like to know ? Right,
let us look into the matter.
“ I got no sleep at night; I would lie for hours
tossing about. In the morning I was worse tired
than when I went to bed.”
Thus writes Mrs. Eliza Mathews, of 1, North
Road, Burnt Oak, Edgware, near London, under
date of September 22nd, 1892. Just two years
before this time she lost her health. A foul taste
in the mouth, loss of appetite, and great distress
after eating were among the first things she com-
plained of. She craved food at times, and fancied
she could eat heartily, yet when the very dishes
she had asked for were set before her she turned
from them as though they were filth from the
gutter. Her skin grew sallow, her eyes yellow,
and she had a constant pain at her chest, sides,
and between her shoulders. Her bowels were
constipated, and the least exertion set her heart
thumping as if it must jump up into her mouth.
At such times it was as much as ever that she
could get her breath. She got so thin and weak
she was no good for work. She couldn’t walk out
doors- without stopping to rest every few rods
almost.
The doctor did what he could for her, all any
doctor could do. At first he said he thought her
illness was owing to the smell of the farm-yard.
This looked possible. Even the smell of violets
has made strong men turn pale and faint dead
away. Yet the doctor was wrong. If he had
been right, she would have got better when the
family left the farm at Bently Priory and went to
live at Burnt Oak. But she was not improved by
the change of air ; she grew worse and worse.
“In May, 1887,” says Mrs. Mathews, “I went
over to Ghlemsford to visit my aunt, Mrs.
Trougliton. She told mo of the good Mother
Seigol’s Curative Syrup had done her when she
had indigestion and dyspepsia. She bought me a
bottle, and 1 began taking it. After a few doses I
felt relief. I kept on taking it, and in two months
I ivas strong and well as ever. My husband and
friends were astonished, yet I assured them that
Seigel’s Syrup had done it. Yours truly, (Signed)
Eliza Mathews.”
The point is plain enough. The convict slept
soundly because he was a healthy man, although
he was a wicked one. Our rich friend rolled about
all night because his nerves were unstrung by the
state of his stomach. Our cor res pon dent was
nrostrated by the same thing—indigestion and
dyspepsia. The remedy named cured her because
it has that power. The reason remains a secret
with the roots and herbs from which it is made.
Yet so long as it drives away disease and gives us
back our health and strength, who cares for its
mystery? Results, not arguments, are what we
all want.
“Burnt Oak House, Edgware, September, 22nd,
1892. I have known Mrs. Mathews for some
seven years, and remember her long and lingering
illness. She informs me that Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup cured her, after medical and other
means failed. Mrs. Mathews is a lady of respecta-
bility, and her word can be implicitly relied upon.
You can use this statement in any way you may
think proper. Yours truly, (Signed) T. H. House,
Grocer and General Provision Dealer, Burnt Oak
Stores, Edgware.”
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Word comes from the Monaro that trout are
being acclimatised in the Snowy River ; thus dots the old
order change and give place to lhe new and the Devil
fulfils himself in many ways. The Snowy River dis-
trict, the home of the mountain cattle and the rough-
riders, will now be overrun by English tourists, with loud
check suits and knickerbockers. These men will write
articles for English magazines descriptive of “A day’s
trout-fishing on the—haw —Snowy Bivah,” and they will
say “I summoned my guide, a trusty fellow, and, taking
my rod, I bade farewell to my hostess, a most civil per-
son, and filling my pocket-flask from my own supply, I
walked down the precipitous declivities that lead to the
bank of this most agreeable little rivah.” Fancy one of
the Tyries, the crack rough-riders from the Tindary
Mountains, being pressed into the service of an English
boiled owl and referred to as “my guide, a trusty
fellow!" That is what it will come to. All the romance
goes out when the tourists come in.
* * * *
The formation of the Vic. Cricket League, and
the consequent secession of the rich clubs from the asso-
ciation, is a very mean device. The alleged reason for
the withdrawal is the “unwieldiness” of the associa-
tion ; the real reason is that the Melb., East, and South
cannot boss Vic. cricket as they like, and because they
grudge the small clubs the share of profits of iuterpro-
vinoial matches and desire to divert this to their own
treasuries. Under the league rules the small clubs are
.charitably permitted to affiliate - i.e., they are allowed to
pay a subscription lor the privilege of doing whatever the
league tells them. They are to have no share in the
government or the profits, and are to play matches among
themselves.
Among theclubs not connected with the league—
which the league, in fact, refused to admit to its charmed
circle—is the University, the club which stood fourth on
the list of the A division last year, and which possesses,
without doubt, the best wicketkeeper in the province.
The omission of the U.U.C. thus shows that the object of
the league’s formation is to confine to an inner ring not
the crack but the gold-glutted clubs, and the powerof the
latter in “ amateur” cricket is only understood when the
lists of their best players are studied. With half-a-dozen
exceptions, every good man in the Melb., the East, or the
South was a good man in one of the smaller clubs before
the temptations of free trips, notoriety, chances of dis-
tinction, and offers of good prizes lured him into one or
other of these elevens.
At every annual meeting is heard the gag about
“drawing on the second elevens.” How many men now
playing in the first elevens of the clubs named came out
of the seconds ? If the association, composed as it is of
the remnants of the pennant clubs, has any pluck, it will
fight. Why not try to procure the co-operation of other
associations to continue playing interprovincial matches
only under its auspices, and to refuse to recognise in any
way the combination that is doing its best to reduce
cricket to the level of pony-racing?
* * •
In its annual report, the Melb. C.G., speaks of
“Mr. W. Bruce, Mr. Hugh Trumble and Roche (prof.)\“
a piece of snobbery now abandoned by the conservative
Australian dailies, and one of which no Australian club
other than the purse-proud M. 0.0. would be guilty.
» * * * *
Mostyn Evan, of S. A., and Jack Portus, of
N.S.W., are pretty' generally' accepted by cricketers as
the joint managers of the next Australian team. “ Ben ”
Wardill, the Majah, was pressed to take on the job, but
the M.C.C. sec. has been ’Orne before with George Gilfen,
and he is not taking any more just now, thank you.

Does not Grace’s exhibition with the bat against
Stoddart’s bowlers—a “duck” and a poor B—strengthen
the impression that English bowlers have been spoon-
feeding the fat man through this season, to assist him in
making British history and in booming his little collec-
tion ?
* * * •
The knowing crowd who all the season seemed
to pull the strings for certain football clubs fell into the
soup over last Vic. premier match. Fitzroy was to go
down to South, and Geelong to beat Ports, and then one
or two other things were to occur. But something went
wrong, and the little game didn’t come off; after 12
years’ hard battling, Fitzroy got home by a neck, and the
curtain was rung down on the worst season the “great
national game ” has ever seen in Vic.
♦ » * *
Act.-Gov. Madden was not only advertised as
patronising the final Vic. football premiership match at
South Melb., bu the turned up with secretary, equerry and
suite. At the first gate he was blocked by the gate-
keeper, and had to “part.” He had also (through the
Aide) to pay for admission to the reserve. The Aide’s
protests were in vain. The gate and reserve keepers
“ didn’t believe he was no Governor.” To make matters
worse, there was not a soul on hand to officially receive
H.E., and it was only after a vigorous hunt that the
president was found. That potentate eventually handed
over to the equerry the money paid for admission.
• ♦ ♦ *
A unique contest recently took place at the hall
of a Melb. pug., when the mate of a China steamer backed
his monkey to kill more rats within a given time than a
certain crack dog. The pup entered the ring first, and in
60sec. had settled 22 rodents. When the corpses were
cleared, the mariner directed that 23 more rats should be
thrown in together, and, this being done, he produced
his little anthropoid from a sack and, placing a tack-

An American gentleman residing at St. Kilda
(Vic.), who professed to own a dog which could “ destroy
anything that lives of its own weight,” w'as recently much
troubled by the nightly howling of a one-eyed, mangy-
looking, black tom-cat, owned by a neighbor. An angry
altercation between the American and the neighbor re-
sulted in the feline's owner accepting an invitation to
“feed his cat to the terrier.” A two-minutes’interview
between the animals, when much eloquence was on tap,
resulted in the neighbor becoming proud possessor of a
Yankee canine windpipe.

Sydney Mail’s “Instructive article on boxing,
with illustrations” is the latest parson-approved outrage
on the humane feelings of decent people. Mister James
evidently forgets that sad Sunday-school story of the
poor widow with the fighting son. She let her son read
articles on boxing, and, when he put a head on all the
village and thumped in the bingey of the old school-
master, the poor widow was proud. But the reckoning
arrived one day—the local policeman came and took up
with one foot (in top of the other all the space in the poor
widow’s small kitchen. “Oi’m come,” he said, “for the
mhurderin O'Flanagan.”

Now that N.S.W. Govt, has taken drastic
measures for the suppp ssion of the totes, perhaps it
will go further, and imprison without the option all pro-
moters and principals who run illegal lotteries, and
raffles and Aunt Sallies, and lucky dips, and fraudulent
side-shows in connection with church bazaars and fancy
fairs, which are decidedly among the worst abominations
on the earth’s surface, the sanctimonious church-choir
not excepted.

If this, from American Bearings, is all true,
champion cyclist Zimmerman has a “soft thing” in his
Australian engagementHe will be handed $5OOO in
gold upon his arrival at Sydney ; in fact, that amount has
already been deposited to his credit. All his own, as well
as his wife’s, expenses after reaching there will be paid by
his Australian managers. He must be there by Nov. 1,
and ride his first race not later than Nov. 16. Three races
a week are the least he can start in, and in every race he
will be guaranteed one-half the amount of the first prize
if he loses, or, of course, the full amount if he wins. At
all race meets where he is advertised to appear, he will
receive one-quarter of the gate-receipts. His contract
terminates in time to allow him to leave for America by
May 1, ’96.

The Court of Queen’s Bench lately decided that
there was not sufficient evidence to prove that the Jockey
Club stewards did knowingly and wilfully permit the
offence of betting—and may the Lord have mercy on the
Court of Q. B.’s soul, if it has a soul. Judge Hawkins,
for instance, is an inveterate racegoer who must have had
a bit in many a stewards’ wager.
Whilst tins wigged tribunal was affecting not to
know of Taitersall’s enclosure, and the revenue which
the Jockey Club derives from big bookmakers, two small
members of the craft were charged at the Guildhall and
West London police courts with having caused an obstruc-
tion by betting in the street. The result in each case was
a £5 fine, and an alderman announced his intention to
put such offences down. One of the cases fell a long way
short of proof. The evidence was much less conclusive
than the facts advanced against the Jockey Club in the
higher court. But circumstances made a difference
between the cases. Whereas an alderman could feel justi-
fied in assuming that bookmakers bet, a Supreme Court
could gammon to assume that the Jockey Club stewards
don’t know why bookmakersshout “the fee-eld a tenner!”
&c., in a special ring at Newmarket.

The Street Betting Act, now before Vic.
Assembly, is laughed at by the bye-way bettors, for the
reason that, in spite of the elaborateness of the Act’s
definition of a street or place, the framers of the bill have
left half-a dozen big loopholes through which the books
can “drive a coach and four."

Pathetic fact that Adelaide bookies who, ere
the reign of the tote, used to bet in “fivers,” are now
only too glad to book humble shilling wagers. The local
betting industry is now almost solely confined to
“ double ” books and commission wagering.
The writer was at Adelaide Globe Hotel, the
resort of the few remaining bookmakers, recently. The
books were betting on a billiard-match. “I’ll lay 60 to
30,” said a penciller who was a big man in the ring in the
ante-tote days, and is still in the first flight. “ I’ll take
it—£6o to £30,” said a mining man. “ Sixty pounds to
thirty! Not me! Make it £3 to 30 bob!” said the
bookie, appalled. To lay the heavier wager would kill
most of the Adelaide books.

The Sydney Polo Club Gymkhana, at Kensing-
ton, on 18th, was a great social function, and, from a
sporting point of view, a distinct success. The mem-
bers of the Queensland polo team competed, and one ol
them, Mr. W. Peak, of Toowoomba, proved himself a con-
siderable way ahead of the local leatherflappers. The
ponies were a very poor lot this year, as the champion
polo pony, Irene, from Muswellbrook, was not competing.
The Cup fell to the pony Donation, and she also secured
the bracelet. In the cigar-and-umbrella race one pony
got terrified at the gingham waving over his head and
rushed blindly into a high galvanised-iron fence, rolling
over and over his rider. When the dust cleared the rider
was seen sitting on the ground amongst his pony’s legs,
still smoking his cigar and holding his umbrella. In the
tandem race, Mr. Peak collided violently with another
team and got a terrible spill, but recovered sufficiently to
compete in the final heat. His ridden pony became dis-
gusted at the whole show and jumped the racecourse
rails with him, but the rider immediately whipped him
round and jumped him back again, amidst loud applause.
The steeplechase brought a lot of horses to grief, Briga-
low, last year’s winner, being killed. This was the well-
known show-jumper—he won the high-jump at last
Sydney show, clearing sft. 7in. in mud. The race was
won by Gossip (by Stamford from a Chatterbox mare),
nominated and ridden by Mr. A. B. Paterson (“The
Banjo ”). A wild scurry in the costume-race brought a
very amusing show to a close.

full swing. Fisher was a capitalist of the decent type

The most striking peculiarity of Randwiok to a

go up. In fact, when a close finish occurs as much bet-

The backing of Paris down to 7 to 1 for the

last week's cable) seven “monkeys” about the little ’un’s
chance will regret his haste. The Frenchmen have a re-

October, by the way, is Paris’s lucky month, as
two Caulfield Cups testify.

The Harvester having retired from Melb. Cup,
Mr. Cook is left with the gallant old Admiral, who will
be found more at home in Melb. Cup than at Caulfield,
despite his prominence in the betting.
Should Palo Alto (who, carrying Bst. 31b., ran
very prominently in the A.J.O. Handicap, IJm., though
starting friendless) represent Mr. Porches in Melb. Cup,
he should run a great horse with but 6st. 121 b, on his
0-year-old back.
The Wycombe Stakes, at A.J.O. Meeting, was
a perfect picnic for Mr. Long’s champion Hopscotch, who
was hammered down to evens in the betting, and scored
his fifth win. He has been well looked after, and not
raced off his legs ; result, a good harvest at this meeting,
with other plums to be picked later. The long, striding
giant Atlas tried to get up to Grand Flaneur s son at the
but was shaken off like a hack. Hopscotch s easy
score reminded old sports of the races won by his unoeaten
sire. _ .

eternal unfitness of matters racing if Quiver were to beat
his heavi iy-backed stable-companion, Hopscotch, and win
Caulfield Cup.

Oup favorite, and is likely to maintain it to the day.
There are a few others who will spring into pencilled
prominence before then, however, and Idolater is one.

Auraria should all be capable of beating the best of the

Extraordinary reversals of form were shown at

confiding public promptly “ went down, but when only
the stable clique were on then they “bobbed up serenely.
The good old weather is supposed to account for all this.

Ury’s turn up in the Members race, and
Quiver’s in the Randwick Plate, made six races to the
credit of the Chipping Norton stable (its cheque totals
£3161) during the A.J.O. meeting. See how the devil
whispers again ! The other day “ Bill ” Long tried to sell
his horses. Now the Evil One sends him some wins, and
tells him to go on and not be a fool. Not that there is

after his unpardonable Epsom mile exhibition. He

WOOL-TRADE WITH JAPAN.
The conclusion of the war between China and
Japan is sure to cause increased commercial
activity, especially in the latter country, and
will doubtless mark a historical period in
the commercial advancement of those Eastern
countries. The National Wool Company, of
Melbourne, has taken the initiative in bring-
ing under the notice of the Wool-brokers’
Association the importance of developing the
present wool-trade with Japan. The first
attempt was made in this direction 20 years ago
by the late Monckton Synnot; a second one in
1885. The movement was properly organised, and
would no doubt have succeeded, but for a sudden
rise in wool-values—a rise of from 25 to 30 per
cent. —which at once killed all interest in the move-
ment, by making wool-producers content with
present gains, and indifferent or lethargic in their
attitude towards a movement which then only
seemed to aim at providing for a vague necessity
which might arise in the dim and distant future.
However, past investigation has proved : —l. That
woollen manufacturing in China and Japan is_ in
its infancy. 2. That China, while possessing
sheep, produces no wool which will compare favor-
ably with our lowest qualities, and that sheep are
there propagated for food chiefly. Also, that
what wool is made use of, is used in the method in I
vogue in Scriptural times, 2000 years ago and up-
wards, with the skin attached. 3. That Japan
cannot breed sheep without growing food to keep
them alive in winter. It is highly desirable that
the efforts of the National Wool Company to de-
velop trade with Japan should be supported
vigorously.— Advt.

HIS GAME OF NAP.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
He was a youth his mates all vowed,
“ An all right chap,”
And nightly with the tote-shop crowd
His little scrap
He wagered, in oheck-suit arrayed
And shook the dice and gaily played
His game o! nap.
And though the tote-shop blossoms still
One finds a gap—
Shocked at one hero s dwindling till
They laid a trap—
And now, beneath the warder s gaze,
With never-ending beat he plays
His game of knap.

The Genuine New Woman.
The latest enlistment under the “New
Woman’s ” banner is Mrs. Gambie, of Howard,
Queensland. She lucidly compares the new with
the old, show’s what it really means, and throws a
new light on the subject. If this is what is meant
by the “New Woman” no husband can object,
for not only is her happiness enhanced, but his
comfort; for what is more conducive to home
comfort than a cheerful, energetic, contented,
healthy wife? She writes: “Having been a
martyr to indigestion for several years, from
which I was mercifully cured by the use of
Warner’s Safe Cure, I desire to publicly make
known the facts, so that others may be induced to
use it and thus take a short cut to health. My
greatest suffering was after taking food, and the
pain was so intense as to cause a reluctance to eat,
and as a natural result I became weak and exces-
sively nervous, and was unable to attend to my
household work. I tried every known means,
without obtaining the ease I so longed for, until
Warner’s Safe Cure was brought under my notice.
I do not remember how many bottles I took, but
I know that the effect was wonderful from the
very commencement, and that in a few months I
was quite cured. My husband has also proved
the Safe Cure to be all that is represented in re*
moving an affection of the kidneys.”*
Paradoxical as it may appear, there are
stations in Queensland where it is found more
economical to ration employes on tinned-meat
than on freshly-killed. The advantage comes
in the cheapness consequent on the wholesale
methods adopted by the canning factories.

Stewart Dawson & Co., 412 Georye-stn.e and Strand Arcade, Sydney,
One of the mysteries of every Australian city
is the man who sits all day in a dingy office with a table
and two chairs for company, and whose sole means of
support is set forth on the battered door-plate outside
in the words : “ John Smith, Financial Agent.” A case
which recently cropped up in an Australian law-court
throws some light on the problem. Z wanted to borrow
£SOOO on freehold security, and he went to Y, a financial
agent, who promised to get it for him. Then, as Y didn’t
know where to get the money, he asked X, another of the
tribe, to do it, and promised him half the commission. X
went to W and offered him half his commission, and W
went to V on the same terms, and V applied to U, also on
the same terms. U got the money, so the dividing pro-
cess went no further. The commission was £SO, so that
Y got £25 for passing on the job; X got £l2 10s. for
ditto; W got £6 ss. for ditto ; V received £3 2s. 6d. for
more ditto; and U received £3 2s. 6d. for finding the
cash. That is how the financial agent lives. X makes a
decent income out of the work, but U, the small man
with the cobwebby office and the battered door-plate, has
to bustle for his crust more vigorously than a corporation
laborer.

“For private sale, on the hill, Argent-street
South, stone house of six rooms, with verandah, together
with five detached iron rooms, outbuildings; quarter-acre
land ; suitable for good dwelling or boardinghouse ; only
£100.” This is a bona-fide Broken Hill advt. Nor was
the place snapped up. It must have cost largely over
£IOOO. In this case, it is true, the value has been
destroyed to a great extent by proximity to the smelters,
pouring out their lead and arsenic fumes. Still, pro-
perties a mile from the smelters will sell for hardly more
than one-eighth of their original cost. Land is almost
valueless. An acre, sold seven years ago for £650, was
last week offered for £BO. It was outrageously dear at
that. Here, by the way, is a problem for those who
assert that the municipalities should raise their revenues
entirely from the unimproved values of land.
Broken Hill is on a goldfield, as are so many
scores of other N.S.W. towns, whether gold has been
found near them or not. Land up to one acre can, there-
fore, be held under miner’s right or business license. The
object is to make and keep land cheap, so that every
miner may have his own home. Speculators forgot this,
and ran up prices, with the result that men who wanted
land simply moved out, where it could be got from Govt,
for almost nothing. Then prices fell, and the land is now,
what it was all along supposed to be, of only a nominal
value—at any rate, it has no monopoly value. A tax, as
suggested, on the unimproved value of the land at Broken
Hill” and other similarly-situated mining towns, would
thus not yield more than enough to pay the town-clerk’s
salary. The writer, let it be added, is a strong land-taxer.

Witheford, a Maoriland newspaper man, has
netted £30,000 in London during the past few months,
through the successful flotation of Coromandel mining
ventures. Coromandel has, since the early fifties, been
noted tor the exceeding richness and disheartening
patchiness of its lodes.
“I hear,” writes The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent, “ that M’Eacharn, of MHlwraith, M'Eaoharn
and Cos., is going to take a hand in the reconstruction of
the Eaglehawk, a Victorian mine floated in London by
M‘lntyre some years ago. The tip is to buy, as the shares
are to go to a good figure.”
The Morgan mine, Wales, run by Pritchard
Morgan, seems to be a pretty big thing. It is located on
a 5000-acre property ; there is a 40-stamp self-feeding mill
(run by water-power), and the ore is chiefly handled by
gravitation throughout. The machinery cost ±60,000,
and the property is electrically lit. The 180 men em-
ployed are barracked at the mine. A river has been
diverted three-quarters of a mile to supply power. The
compressed air for the purpose of working the rock-
borers and hoisting the stuff out of the shafts
is furnished by hydraulic pressure. The same com-
pressed air works the pumps, and the water pumped
out of the shafts assists in crushing. All the machinery
in the fitters’ shop is worked by compressed air, and the
same power generates the electricity with which to light
the mines. There is no rest for the water. After it has
accomplished all this it is diverted into another turbine,
where sufficient power is obtained to strike ninety blows
a minute, day and night, with the forty half-ton stamps.
There is some very rich stuff in chutes; early in the
summer four tons were treated, which yielded 400 oz. gold.
But the mine relies for its success on big bodies of
low-grade ore. For the nine months ended April last
10,747 tons of ore were treated at the mine, which yielded
an average of 12|dwt. per ton. During the month named,
the last of the nine, 1385 tons were treated, yielding an
average of loz. 6dwt. 19gr. to the ton—official figures,
given on the authority of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
ho receives the royalties. The cost of working, includ-
ing royalties, rent, and everything else, is not more than
nine or ten shillings a ton.

Jim and Jack were mates at the begin-
ning of Hannan’s rush. Jim pegged out a claim,
Red Hill, going 7oz. a day ; Jack one in a gully, about
200yds. off, going loz. When they had been working
three weeks, news came to Hannan’s of a great find 40
miles N.E. Jim and Jack, afraid of missing a good thing,
held a consultation. They were certainly getting good
gold between the two claims ; but, according to report,
nothing like the quantity that was being unearthed at the
new rush. So they decided that while Jim Went to try
the new country, Jack should stay at Hannan’s and shep-
herd the claims. Next morning Jim set off with two
horses and a month’s tucker, Jack going to work on the
Red Hill, leaving a spade, pick and riddle in the other
claim, as if the owner had just gone away for a spell.
Presently a big Swede came along, jumped into the
claim, threw the tools on the bank, and started to break
down some wash that was stripped. Jack rushed down
with an indignant, “Hello, mate, what the deuce are you
doing in there? Can’t a chap leave his claim for a
minute without some blessed foreigner jumping it?” The
Swede got out and said he was sorry; he thought the
claim was deserted ; but, as he had put none of the wash
through the sieve, there was no harm done. With that,
he picked his tools up and walked away. Jack filled his
sieve and started to work, but left off to curse his fate
when he saw “ the blessed foreigner ” walk straight up
and take possession of his Red Hill claim. Jack took
Boz. altogether out of the remainder of the claim he
rescued ; the Swede got 7oz. daily till the other claim was
worked out. A week later Jim turned up, half dead, and
carrying ins swag. The rush w 7 as a failure ; one horse
died, and the other was “shook ” along with his tucker.

The Murobison has nearly 200 head of stamps
supposed to be working. Yet the gold-returns are less
than 9000 oz. per month—including alluvial, specimens,
&c., from Lawler’s, Peak Hill, and all sorts of little dig-
gings up to the tropic of Capricorn.

A correspondent : —Ballarat district is usually
considered well advanced in mining, but from what is to
be seen near Pitfield, 30 miles from Ballarat, one would
not think so. The new 7 Pitfield co. is driving an
inclined tunnel, about 1000 feet, to save sinking a
shaft 60 feet. The claim is on rising ground, 30ft. above a
c reek—and wash is about 60ft. from surface of hill. The
co. has started a tunnel as low as it can, and has driven
about 800 ft., and is now crosscutting. The face of the
tunnel is about 30ft. below entrance, and the little water
that is making is baled into trucks and wheeled out. For
stupidity, this style of mining surely takes the cake.

Ed. Bulletin,— Re Central Queensland G.M.
Proprietary Cos. “An Old Q. Miner,” in issue June 1, is
fair on it. The iand would never have been freehold at
all if the Chinaman could have made rice. All the fos-
sickers about know this, and did not oppose the applica-
tions. Let me remark that one individual who testifies to
the good prospects of the scheme, before I left the dis-
trict, wanted to sell his land to the co., and another had
already done so.
I will not say those gentry lie as
Did in old times one Ananias :
They suffer from unconscious bias.
The only gold most of the old residents have extracted for
a long time has been from the udder of the fertile cow.
And they would cheerfully subscribe to a scheme for
obtaining sugar from the local gum-trees to get a job at
the factory. Briefly stated, the land is worth, I should
say, about 10s. an acre for grass, and the vendors are
going to register with a capital of £200,000 in order
to find something payable. I, too, sniff at the dredge on
the Boyne. The few reefs in the neighborhood that have
paid gave their best results nearest the grass, and the
gold duffered out as depth was reached. The shoots are
mostly short, and, till someone proves that there is any
gold below 300 ft., such a capital is ridiculous.—R.F.
* * * ♦
The Coolgardie telegraphic hummer says of the
“ Westralia” mine; “A number of costeens about 15ft.
deep also uncover the lode through the property. Rich
gold has been found in these pits, bulk tests giving yields
up to 138 oz. to the ton, whilst 12 or 13oz. to the ton can
be obtained from stone lying about on the surface.”
When the writer remembers that within a quarter-mile
of this mine there is a 15-head battery which has often
wanted public crushing during the last 12 months, talk
like this makes him feel very tired.

A N.S.W. gold-mine report: “Still in the blue

Anoldfellowwaslatelyfounddeadin his hut near
Avoca (Vic.). His story was that in the early fifties, when
“ on a wild tear,” he planted over lOOoz. gold, and had
been vainly searching for it ever since.

G. G. Turri, in the Banker’s Magazine,
alleges that the Victorian patent of the Australian Gold
Recovery Cos. is worthless, “since the patentees have most
unaccountably neglected to put in any complete specifi-
cation of their (cyanide of potassium) invention.” The
larger question, as to whether the cyanide process is a
valid patent anywhere and anyhow, has been already
raised. Judge Romer, in London, decided that there can
be no invention in the mere use of cyanide solutions. The
Supreme Court at Berlin has annulled the patent; a suit
to prove its alleged invalidity is pending in South Africa ;
the Maoriland Attorney-General is moving in the
same direction, though the Q. Government has
refused to follow suit. Thus far, Australia doesn’t
feel the pinch of the Gold Recovery Cos., because the cya-
nide process failed in test-oases where the ore contains
copper also. But the squeals of South African mine-
owners, who have been paying heavy royalties to the
patentees since 1891, testify to the bigness of the pinch
when it comes.

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
yir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both ifr
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be moat happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper ot
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of' ybur Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated —
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to

efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline Universal Pills cured me, when all other remedies and
doctors failed, of a stubborn ease of Debility ot 18 years’ standing. My

Messrs. W. 0. YUILLE & CO.’S CERTIFICATE.
We hereby certify that we sold on account of Mr. John Crozikr the St. Alban’s Estate to Mr.
W. R. Wilson on March 30, 1890, for the sum ot .£70,000 cash. At this time the property was very
lightly stocked. We have examined Mr. Wilson’s books, and certify further that blood stock to the
value (actual cost) of £32,041 has since been added to those originally purchased. Further, that the
sides of St. Alban’s Yearlings conducted by us during the seasons 1890-1-2-3 and 1894 realised a
total of 33,841 guineas, or an average of 210 guineas each.

I.—THE ST. ALBAN’S ESTATE, con-
sisting of 842 acres, situated miles east of
Geelong, Victoria, Australia. The property is
divided into 30 paddocks, many with live hedge
fences.
As a Breeding and Racing Establishment it is
questionable if any more complete place exists in
Europe; certainly it has no rival in Australia.
Originally selected and laid out by Mr. James
Wilson, one of the keenest judges in the colonies,
money has continued to bo freely expended on
improving and perfecting it by Mr. W. R.
Wilson, its present owner, so that it is now one
of the show places of Victoria.
The land is extremely fertile and sound, nearly
all the paddocks being laid down in English
grasses. The Barwon River (2 chains wide and
20ft. deep) intersects the property, thus ensuring
a never-failing supply of fresh water, alike for use
and irrigation. The system for the latter is per-
fect, the drains being most extensive, and the
steam-pumping plant has a capacity of 120,000
gallons per hour. The rainfall is, however, so
good that it is rarely necessary to irrigate more
than two or three paddocks during a summer.
The plantations and hedges, of which several
miles exist, add to the usefulness and beauty of
the estate in a marked degree.
Shelter Sheds of large capacity are placed in
many of the paddocks, while the Yearling
Quarters consist of 40 loose boxes, cool and well
ventilated, built in quadrangular form, and of
ample size. Stone and brick tanks, windmills,
and feed-bins are placed in convenient places in
the various paddocks, and the yards, &c., are
ample and periectly arranged.
In the centre of the Estate the Training Track
and Course proper are laid out (1£ miles and I
mile 5 furlongs round respectively). Both may
well be compared to Flemington or Randwick,
the going being good in all weathers.
The Scraping Sheds are most suitably placed,
and an Elevated Stand commands a most perfect
view of the tracks, river, and estate generally,
with the far-famed Barrabool Hills in the dis-
tance.
The Stallion Boxes are lofty and well-designed,
opening into a large covered-in exercise ground.
Feed rooms, men’s rooms, &c., are under the
same roof. The Training Stables are perfect, and
3011 tain 15 loose boxes, feed rooms, men’s rooms,
md every necessary adjunct to a first-class estab-
ment. Two cottages for stable boys are in close
proximity, and the out-buildings are extensive
stud ample.
THE HOUSE —Brick and of modern design,
oousists of about 30 rooms, and is a perfectly
appointed gentleman’s residence, beautifully situa-
ted, having a superb view of the You Yang
Ranges and Cono Bay, the latter only two miles
distant.

The very first paragraph in a recent issue
of Lloyd’s Weekly (Eng.)—circulation 800,000 a

One of the queerest companies recently started in Aus-
tralia Is that formed to breed blank rats upon an island in
t ie Sound. A large profit is expected from the
skins.
In a wife-desertion case recently heard at
Freeman tie (W. A.) Police Court, defendant denied
that plaintiff was his wife, and swore she was his
brothers. Complainant averred she had arrived
only on the previous day from N.S.W. She was
married in Sydney in April, ’8G, and her husband
deserted her last April. As the asinine Bench
had only a photo, of the alleged delinquent—her
husband—to adjudicate upon, they decided to fine
defendant ,£5 !! 1
Cann, M.P. (N.S. W.), in denouncing
newspaper publication of the details of crimes
alleged against accused persons, would have im-
pressed Parliament more deeply had he directed
attention to the daily newspaper habit of publish-
ing fact, fancy and gossip when the accused is of
the shady or shabby class, and of being discreetly
reticent regarding details when he is supposed to
possess influence. In the one ease the crimes are
indubitably exaggerated ; they are given features
of horror which scare the unwary public into a
clamor for the wildest vengeance; in the other,
facts are sifted and irresponsible gossip rejected.
One day, about a fortnight ago, an elderly
Sydney lady appeared before the Chief Justice to
prosecute another old lady to the utmost limits of
the law. The other elderly lady appeared to
defend the case, and they fought it out with
bitter determination for eight days, with the
aid of a Q.O., three other barristers, and two
firms of solicitors. The trouble arose through
certain alterations made in one back-yard which
were said to have depreciated the value of the
yard adjoining, and the whole damage could have
been remedied at a cost of <£4. Case ended with
a verdict for defendant, and, as the Chief Justice
pathetically remarked, the ruin of both parties in
costs. It is a settled delusion with the average
woman that she can run a big litigation for about
60s., and it is only when the bill comes in for
<£684 16s. 8d. that she realises the nature of the
situation. If Parliament would only enact that
every lawyer’s bill should be handed in at the con-
clusion of the ease, and the amount be published
at the end of the newspaper report, it would do a
great deal to suppress useless law proceedings.

Editor Bulletin, — History more or less
repeats itself. The celebrated Justice Byles, of
England, “ in cases of poisoning where he had
made up his mind, showed neither mercy nor
pity.” Byles presided at the trial of the cele-
brated Catherine Wilson, who was accused of
having poisoned several people. Some of her
alleged victims were disinterred, and rigid
examinations conducted by the most eminent
authorities of the day. At her trial for the
alleged poisoning of a Mrs. Soames, Byles, with-
out any medical testimony whatever, summed up
dead against Wilson, and “guilty ” was the ver-
dict. In passing sentence, he said; “I am as
certain that you also poisoned Mrs. Atkinson as
if I had seen you do so with my own eyes.”
Catherine Wilson was first to have been tried for
the alleged poisoning of the woman Atkinson,
Dr. Nunneley, the celebrated chemist, after
several days’ investigation, having found traces of
arsenic (the examination took place after the body
had been two years buried). Everything was
ready, and the trial about to begin, when Dr. N,
announced that he wished to withdraw his
chemical evidence in toto : he had used the test of
Riensch, and the arsenic he found came from his
own copper-plate. This, of course, stopped the
whole proceeding, but the authorities proceeded
to dig up the body of Mrs. Soames, after six
years’ burial. This was a farce, however, for
Byles had Wilson convicted —as before stated—
without any medical evidence whatever,
although the chemists openly stated that they
utterly failed to find any trace of poison. The
press protested, but the Judge’s view prevailed.
Byles further told Mrs. Wilson he was certain she
had poisoned a man named Mawer; yet a six
days’ analysis, conducted by Dr. Taylor and
others, failed to reveal poison. Baron Martin, in
sentencing the celebrated Pilizzoni, made use of
the now historic expression, “I am as sure,” &c.,
yet the man’s innocence was afterwards conclu-
sively proven.— Medicos.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. If you have a long thin font, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

‘‘The boots fit splendidly and are very cheap. You
should extend your business to N.Z., where no such system
is in vogue. I shall do what I can to recommend you.”—
GEO. PAMMENT, Seddon-st., Kumara, N.Z. May 7,1895.
“ The boots you made me from description of my toot
and self-measurements have more than satisfied me. I
never had a pair of such well-fitting and comfortable
boots—so much so, that I have discarded all my old
enemies. Your price, with duty and everything, does
not come up to the price charged here for boots not to

A Maoriland paper finished up a maudlin
account of the hanging of Mrs. Dean, the Winton
baby-farmer, with the words: “On Monday
morning last Mrs. Dean was met in the Kingdom
beyond the grave by half-a-dozen little cherubim,
who in life she was so kind to, showing that such
acts of kindness are not forgotten even beyond
the grave.” For mild disgustingness this is
unique.
A drayman, brought before Me’lb. City
court on a charge of cruelty to a horse, the animal
being galled under the collar, deposed that he
received 10s. a week and had a family to support.
Fined half-a-crown. Poor wretch ! What an
alternative —kindness to his children or cruelty to
his horse !
Dear Bulletin, —Shearing has come again,
and with it the usual poetry and big-tally yarns,
cheques as big as blankets, and so on. Like many
more, I was once fool enough to believe that
shearing at £1 per 100 was merely picking up
money. I’ve had a bitter experience since and
have lived to curse the day I first took hold of a
pair of blades ! There’s nothing in it. After
riding or walking half across the continent and
wearing out your wardrobe, you may, if lucky and
there’s no strike on, drop into a shed. Ten to
one the rain pours down in buckets (droughts are
exceptional) as soon as the cook is “put in,”
which means three or four days’ tucker to work
out for a start. Then you have to buy your
shears, stone and oil, &c., and one pair of your
shears and the stone are pretty sure to be duffers.
Shears are 4s. 6d. a pair; stone, 2s. 6d. per lb.
Then you make a start, and first day a ram puts
his horns through your flannel. Bang goes ss. 6d.
Next day a big wether tears your brand-new moles
to fringes. That’s 50 sheep—los. fid. The next
thing is a subscription-list. All the deaf, dumb,
blind, and lame seem on the warpath at shearing-
time, and hardly a day passes but some cripple
arrives with a collection-box. Then there are the
ever-cadging parsons, priests, Sisters of Mercy,
Catholic-bazaar-ticket-vendors, and many othei
holy beggars; as well as circuses, wire-walkers,
boxers, minstrels, and other shows. Presently
the boss comes on the board and announces that
he is thinking about raffling a couple of horses at
£1 per member. Of course, he wishes you dis-
tinctly to understand that he doesn’t care a pin
as to whether he gets the affair off or not. Cer-
tainly not; but if you don’t ante-up your “ quid ’’
you can bet an oil-rag against a grind-stone that
you’ll get the “ sack ” the day after the raffle.
Add to these hospital-donation, union-ticket, &c.,
and calculate where you’ll be.—6 x 8.

The Two Macks .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
M'Oarty was sitting in the sun on the big log by
their bark hut; he had a large iron bucket between
his knees, and was moodily peeling potatoes with
a jack-knife. The two Macks always ‘ ‘ barked
the spuds ” on Sundays. The plum-duff was
boiling leisurely in a nail-keg on the open-air fire.
Inside, Mackenzie superintended the i ousting of
the leg of mutton, and the chant of the camp-oven
mingled with the drone of the locusts in the still,
tall t-ees, and made the old hut seem wonderfully
home-like.
The two Macks were the best “ batchers ” in
the district; they were as neat and as careful of
things as two old women, and their hut was
always trim and tidy. No salmon-tins littered the
ground about their stringybark home. Tinned-fish
is the lazy, shiftless man’s “grub.” The two
Macks cooked regularly and fared well.
They had been true mates for twenty odd years,
in luck and out, in sickness and in health, and
had been better friends than brothers. Their
mateship had, after two years, become a synonym
at Keep-it-Dark for straight-going, square-dealing
and real grit.
M'Oarty was about 50, short, grizzled, burnt,
and silent; Mackenzie was three or four years
his junior—tall, spare, hard, healthy, and also
silent. These two men, each of whom had more
than once during their long friendship proved his
readiness to lay down life for the other, sea cely
exchanged a dozen words in a week.
But of late a coolness had been noticed between
Jacky Mack and Harry Mack. M'Oarty had
deliberately turned his back upon Mackenzie on
Saturday night in Grafton’s har, he had scorn-
fully refused Harry’s assistance when going home
“ with his load,” and had walked off the tramline
into the creek in consequence thereof ; moreover,
he had neglected to take Mackenzie hot crib when
the latter was on afternoon shift and he day-shift
at the Morning Star.
Keep-it-Dark remarked this and wondered.
Dick Howard had it in his mind as he perched on
the other end of the log, chipping at his plug and
eyeing Jacky Mack bent sulkily over his spuds.
“Don’t seem very gay this mornin’, Jack,” he
said.
M'Oarty viciously gouged the eye out of a
potato, and replied with a grunt.
“ M’be you’n Harry Mack don t hit it off es
sweet es you might, eh ? ”
“He ain’t what I took him fer,” said Jack,
mournfully.
“ Es how 2 ” queried Dick.
Mackenzie now appeared outside the hut, and
began gathering chips into his hat.
“I bin a good mate t’ that feller,” said Jack,
impressively, pointing his knife at him, “ more’n
24 year, an’ now he’s goin’ back on me after all I
done fer him.”
Harry Mack jooked painfully guilty, and
clutching his hat fled under cover again.
“Bin robbin’ yeh2” suggested Curious Dick,
shifting nearer and sinking his voice to a whisper.
Jack thought it over for a few minutes in his
slow way, and he replied in the negative, with a
heavy contempt for the insinuation.
“ He ain’t actin’ the clean pertater me, that’s
all,” he added. “ He can t say 1 aint bin a true
mate,” he continued with sudden energy. “At
Eaglehawk there I nursed him through the fever
an’ shakes, an he had a bad hand at Fryingpan. I
did all the cookin’ an’ washin’-up fer a month. He’s
bin comfortable all the time, an’ ain’t wanted for
nothin’, an’ now he goes an’ turns dog.” Jack
looked down like a martyr, and the hand holding
the potato trembled visibly.
“You ain’t tellin’ how, I s’pose,” insinuated
Howard.
‘ ‘ Know that widder up the hill what sells the
milk ? ” continued M'Oarty. “ Great, ain’t she?”
“ Well, medium,” answered Howard, dubiously.
“ I think she’s great,” said Jack, decisively.
“ Anyhow, I s’pose you’ve noticed Harry bangin’
round there. I don’t blame him for that, mind.
He’s a bit gone, nor I don’t blame him fer that—
I ain’t unreasonable. I’ve bin shook on em meself
in my time, an’, above all, I ain’t unreasonable.
But I do think it dirty mean to go back on a mate
what’s stood by you fer over 20 year, an’ what
sorter trick d’ye think that Harry Mack’s playin’
me 2 He’s goin’ ter get married — (join’ ter get
married II”
Dick whistled for sheer amazement; Jack, the
wronged mate, groaned and cursed over his
potatoes; and Harry, standing in the doorway,
shamefaced, plucked at his shirt-buttons, the very
picture of conscious guilt.
“Coin’ ter get marriedl!” repeated Jack.
“ There’s a discontented beggar for yeh ! ”
EDWARD DYSON.
“And marriage and death and division make barren
our lives.”
“ Oh no, sir, O’Coighley is not the greatest
scoundrel unhung. He is a parson, but lie might
have been a lawyer ; and he is an Irishman, but
lie might have been a Scotchman,”— Dr. Parr.
From Oastlemaine (Vic.) Mail :—“ His
Excellency the Administrator of the Government
and Lady Madden, after formally opening the
Daffodil Show at the Town Hall, proceeded to
Messrs. Goldsbrough, Mort and Co.’s warehouse,
and performed the like pleasing ceremony for the
splendid sheep exhibited there.”
The sole legacy left by Minnie Dean, the
officially-strangled M.L. murderess, consisted of
57 closely-written pp. of MS. of a quasi-religious
nature, intended for publication, the proceeds to
go to her husband after £5 had been paid to a
certain widow. Though supposedly educated,
Minnie Dean’s composition shows ignorance
throughout. Her “ confession ” amounts to this :
She gave one of the children mentioned at the
trial laudanum to keep it quiet whilst travelling.
An overdose killed it, but she never intended
death. In the other case the child died on her
hands ten minutes after receiving it, and fear
prompted burial in the garden, bulbs being
planted over the grave to divert suspicion.
Dear Bulletin, —Your omniscience is at
fault for once—for twice! Be correction of Mrs.
Campbell Praed (Sept. 7), men out-back do travel
with water-bags slung round their horses’ necks
—up Bourke way you hardly ever see anything
else. As to spinifex bushes, a man likes to die
under something ; and, if he couldn’t get anything
bigger, no doubt hff would take a spinifex bush.
Item, re your Samoan correspondent (Aug. 24).
Gilbert Casey couldn’t possibly give Mrs. Lane
her passage-money from the Royal Tar sale, inas-
much as the Tar was sold by the opposition crowd
—Mrs. Lane’s crowd—and (filbert never fingered a
cent of the cash, though ho pled hard to, on
behalf of the men whose money bought the ship.
And it wasn’t the Tar sailors, but some W.Q.
shearers, who subscribed .£7O odd for Mrs. L.’s
and children’s passage.— Henry.
His One Virtue.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
We had been swapping cynicisms, diluted with
whisky and soda. There were three of us, and
The Man Who Didn’t Count. Certainly he paid
for the drinks, but we never took any notice of
him.
The conversation had fallen into a rut on the
subject of virtue in Man. Even the best of us
get a craving now and then to talk about the
impossible. Pottinger stated authoritatively that
Man is not virtuous by nature, and never by
education. I agreed with Pottinger. I always
agree with big men. Besides, it seemed self-
evident. Erskine, who is young and therefore
experienced, made an advance on Pottinger. He
said, “There is no such thing as virtue at all ”
Without subscribing to this liberal doctrine we
agreed that, at any rate, man hadn’t any. Then
The Man made one of his remarks.
“I knew a man once,” he said, “who had a
virtue. It was not an ordinary virtue, as you will
see when I tell you that he drank heavily, gambled
—with other people’s money—had no morals of
any sort, and never did a charitable action in his
life. He beggared a few widows and orphans,
and then committed suicide because they were
going to put him in gaol, and he hated mixing
with honest people. But with all his vices he had
one virtue and I believe I am the only man
who knew of its existence.’
The’ Man turned his glass upside down and
drummed meditatively on the bottom with his
fingers. We waited.
“ He owed his first start in life to a good-
natured idiot who befriended him because he was
an idiot; took him out of the gutter, literally;
put food into his stomach and clothes on his
back ; and finished up his idiocy by giving him a
sum of money. Had it not been for that fool the
man would probably have died respectably in the
streets. Years afterwards, when he was well up
in the world, he had the chance of ruining this
man who befriended him when he was nobody.
He had the chance of wiping out the obligation
by constituting himself the worst enemy that
fellow had. And, remember, he owed everything to
him ” —The Man pushed the glass away from him
slowly—” and —he didn’t do it 1 ”
The Man nodded to us and turned to go.
“ But ” observed Pottinger.
“Well, you see,” said The Man, “I was the
idiot.” Then he went out.

S.A. Obituary notice :
HORNE.—On the 20th June, 1895, at her son’s (Alexan-
der) residence, near Auburn, Ann, relict of the late James
Horne, late of Alberton, aged 93 years. A colonist of
fifty-five years, arrived April, 1840, in the ship Morley,
leaving- seven sons, one daughter, thirty-nine grand-
children, seventy-five great-srrandchildren, and five great-
great grandchildren to mourn their loss ; all but five of
her children were born in South Australia.
Throusfh this world she toiled,
With many ups and downs,
And often listened to hear
That sweet trumpet sound.
The angels would not blow it
Until they uot the word
That her days were ended.
She now has gone unto the Lord.
Francis Clark, the “ faithful gillie ” in
succession to John Brown, has also left Her
Gracious Majesty lamenting, it seems. High
living and no work is the worst course of treat-
ment that a braw Heelander can be subjected to.
Queen Victoria is as much responsible for the
premature demises of John and Francis, as a
missionary is accountable to Heaven for the lung-
disease of any dusky savage whom he converts to
Christianity by the aid of a pair of blankets and a
woollen comforter.
Mackay is on the warpath. Its virtuous
saccharine soul is indignant at the apathy of the
Government on the local Kanaka-outrage question.
The citizens of Sugar-town have met in solemn
conclave and formulated a charter which runs
thus :
1. That all Kanakas be put to bed at 10.
2. That all Kanakas going to and from Sunday-school
be escorted by the police.
3. That any Kanaka found in possession of anv other
weapon than a “ Glory-be-to-God” book be immediately
arrested.
4. That a day of public humiliation and prayer be im-
mediately appointed, &c., &c.
Seriously, how can anyone sympathise with the
Mackay people ? They only sowed the wind to
reap the whirlwind.
The humorists of Tas. Assembly have in-
vented a new joke. Recently, when a member
was in the midst of a fervid oration, another
M.L.A. deposited a glass of water on his seat,
and when he finished speaking he naturally sat
down in the refreshing fluid. The victim fixed
on a certain politician as the perpetrator of the
outrage, and next time the suspected one was
speaking, got a friend to surreptitiously plant a
glasa of water on his seat, by way of retaliation.
Then he rose to a point of order, and, as the other
man had to sit down till the question was decided,
he naturally sat on the glass of water and em-
bedded part of the vessel in his system. Little
amenities like these go a long way to brighten the
dreary paths of politics.
The pious platitudinarian has bobbed up
by the dozen to tell Sydney D.T. “ Outis ” that,
though it’s a precious and beautiful thing to stick
the knife into cant—when it happens to be the
other fellow’s! —he is but sounding brass and a
tinkling cymbal when he gets on to the particular
brand of humbug anent which these holy men
proceed solemnly to discharge themselves of the
same old gags in the same old sequence. “The
drought,” pronounces one painful ass, “is ob-
viously a punishment for neglect of God ! ” —by
the suffering cattle and sheep ? “ Only the Bible,”
snorts another saint, “can explain the cause of
droughts ! ” Well, let us put our trust in the
Bible, but keep our Wragge dry. “ According to
your faith shall it be done unto you,” quotes yet
another text-worshipper, who conveniently for-
gets both the counter-assertion that “Hesendeth
His rain upon the just and upon the unjust ” and
the fact that He is at present withholding said
rain no less from the man of snuffle than from the
man of scoff.
Do you wish to surprise your wife or
daughter? Then tell them Hordern Brothers,
Pitt Street (only), Sydney, are making fashion-
able costumes to order from One Guinea, and will
send patterns of materials (used in making them)
post free. (Self-measurement forms enclosed with
patterns.)

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Let us camp!” ’Twas my mate who had spoken.
The long Summer sunlight expired
As we threw down our swags—we had broken our
recox-d to-day and were tired.
Tired, tired! There is something to tire, and
something more poignant than pain.
When work is your quest and desire —and for
months you have sought it in vain.
No work could be had for the buying, as tho’ the
world’s people were past
The needs of all toil, and were trying to live the
millennium at last.
With a miser’s reluctance we parted the coins
that would daily seem less ;
And the time-honored method was started, that
never is quite a success.
You only can know when your lack is of pence to
exchange for your bread
What the charm or romance of the track is in the
tales of the bush you have read.
We lighted a fire, then I went down the hill to
the township in sight,
While my mate cut a pole for the tent and made
things secure for the night.
I met an old fellow, a hawker, and I thought I
would give him a trial,
But appalling he proved as a talker, and ended at
last with denial.
He grumbled, stretched out on the ground, at the
numoer of tramps, and he came
Right on deck over Labor and found every evil
was done in its name.
Time teaches you where to solicit: time teaches
you also to pitch
The tale of hard times and to visit not always the
homes of the rich.
But at length I made up to a house and my way
round the premises found ;
The place was at least worth a thousand, with
orchard and garden around.
I thought it too wealthy to trouble, but the night
was too near then to choose
’Tween the poor, whom I know to give double,
and the rich who will often refuse.
When upon you devolves, without feigning, the
mendicant's task, you repair
To the province of trenchers, where reigning, the
cook is the president there.
The cook was not there, as I reckoned, but a lady
whose face made me start;
I faltered and felt for a second a beat that was
new to my heart.
She was plucking some delicate roses in the shade
of the house where they grew,
And she saw me, and came from the closes of
vines that were dampling with dew.
By her marvellous eyes, by her face not of beauty,
but tenderness, sweet,
I knew her, and seemed to embrace all the past in
a vision complete.
She didn’t know me. I was only one more of
those swagmen that came
From the red dusty road, and the lonely harsh life
that was open to claim.
I told her my tale, but before I had finished what
pity it took —
That face I had seen moved of yore ; I remem-
bered with anguish the look.
She gave with a hand that had spared not the
larder, nor had it forborne
To search for a shilling—we fared not so bad, with
some left for the morn.
Round the pine wood that sparkled and crackled
and sent up its odorous smoke.
My mate asked me where had I tackled to make
such a rise at a stroke.
I told him my venture. He pressed me to tell him
of her I had seen,
And marvelled to know what possessed me to
mention those days that have he m ;
He thought to hear something exciting, with
infamy woven therein;
But I said: “It is not worth reciting, there’s no
incident heightened of sin.
It’s part of the life of a child, on whom fata laid
its perilous hand,
That I knew in those fierce days and wild, when
gold was the god of the land.
Thirty years, at the least, have flashed over these
plains and the far-away sea,
Since I went to ‘Pactolus.’ A rover I was, and
am fated to be.
The Warden, he gave it that name, because in the
stream there was gold,
And he talked of the mystery and fa no that clung
to some river of old.
But the diggers they called it Red Creek, for the
water was turbid and red
Wi h the sludge that was swept from the streak
of wash that they worked in the tied.
Bud back from the stream was the lead, tbit
wound away on to the hills,
That into the distance recede where the stampers
were set and the mills.
Ten thousand there were on the field, with scarcely
a hund ed on gold,
But they got a magnificent yield —our claim was
so wet that I sold
Out my share to a friend, and I built some pud-
ling-machines, and I made
A fairly good thing, but the gilt wont to him who
was first in the trade.
I was nett man to him on the dam—a swaggering
hector and vain.
But they afterwards proved him a sham, and his
fast reputation was slain.
His daughter, he made her of use —the horse for
the pump that supplied
The water to puddle and sluice, she drove on the
dam at my side ;
She drove under clanking and stir of chains
through the dark days and bright.
And then was the girlhood of her, whom we owe
for our supper to-night.
I was then on the field a new-comer. She was
twelve, and barefooted, and brown
With the great naked sun of the summer, who-e
light was as flame sweeping down.
At the mill there, her father presided o’er the
round, draggled pit of gilt mud,
And the harrows went round till they grided and
mixed the red wash like to blood.
There were always a lot at the mill; the idle men
met there to glean
Any news of fresh rushes (that fill the digge with
fervency keen).
Large oaths and small talk there were mini led
with manlier converse that found
Ears that heard, ’midst the gear-chains that jin-
gled, and the harrows went round and went
round.
The mullock-heaps, seeming to grow, rose up in
the tree-fallen rents;
And away on the broad flat below lay the clay-
colored army of tents.
To the summers not only indebted, that flamed,
was the girl for her grace
(Tho’ the sun with her cheeks had coquetted and
deepened the tone of her face),
But she somehow was free; and she shared in that
fine vital spirit that springs
With the freedom of toil unimpaired by the help-
lessness slavery brings.
Four years had slipped by, and I sold to a digger
my mills, and I went
Further south. But before I had rolled together
my blankets and tent
I went down one evening to settle my score at the
pub. and I found
The new man asserting his mettle, and the puddler
distressed in a ‘ round. ’
He had always cut capers of flashness, but for
space he was hindered and fast;
Though it seemed that his insolent rashness got
scope to be measured at last.
He came to his feet and they parried, for the
other was seeming to fence —
Who danced round his man, then he carried his
aim with a mad rush intense.
He drove back the puddler, unheeding a cry from
a child’s lips that broke.
For she saw that her father was bleeding (and tho
instinct that slumbers awoke) ;
She picked up a spike, nor dissembled, but sprang
as a tigress may spring,
And the new man reeled backwards and trembled,
and clutched at a miner to cling
For support, but he pulled him right over the
edge of the mill and they fell
In a pit whose dire horrors would cover mmy
stories related of Hell.
When the horse could be stopped in another half
circuit we sprang down with dread,
And the man dragged in by the other was the one
that we lifted out dead.
I left shortly after, and never of one from that
field could get sight
ThrQ the long years that kill men and sever, till I
went for that tucker to-night.”

HUBERT YOUNG.
Baronet Newnes, the Tit Bits pirate, lost
his seat in the House of Commons at last election.
He was one of the notoriously silent members, so
silent that he ne v er once opened his mouth during
his parliamentary career. At first he was a
pretty regular attendant, because he had heard
that the speakers occasionally made original jokes,
and he wanted to crib the flashes of wit for his
publications. But when he discovered that all
the jokes were Tit Bits rehashed, which he might
just as well cut from the back numbers of the rag
that founded his fortunes, he lost all interest in
vulgar politics, and left the Commons to their fate.
One of these days the paste-and-scissors baronet
will buy a peerage and a seat in the Upper House.
One of the oldest N.B.W. police-pen-
sioners died the other day, aged 85, at the old gold-
mining town, Sofala, on the historic Turon.
Sergt.-Major Edward Giles belonged to what was
known as the “gold-police,” and retired on
pension in ’59. Two other pensions of the fifties
are still on the roll —one at 4s. 6d. per day, the
other at 3s. An interesting N.S.W. pension item
is the allowance of Is. per day to Mrs. Louisa
Codrington, widow of Const. R. D. Codrington,
who, in ’5B, was shot dead by supposed bush-
rangers at Wyagdon Hill, between Bathurst and
Sofala, The culprits were never discovered.
Imitation and Originality—A Back-
blocks Study.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Imitation is the first condition of progress,”
says Win wood Reade, slightly paraphrasing
Goethe. “ Paradoxical as it may appear—lmita-
tion is the necessary antecedent of Originality.”
Imitation is, certainly, the first condition of
progress—sometimes.
In the north-western backblocks you may see
the above aphorism tested.
Vision the first. A Chinaman sits at the door
of his opium-den, smoking. An aboriginal passes
and gazes wistfully on the opium-smoker. Next
day John sells the woolly barbarian opium -char-
coal to the value of one shilling.
Vision the second. An aboriginal lies in his
gunyah smoking opium-charcoal out of a pipe cun-
ningly devised as follows :—an inkbottle serves as
the bowl of the pipe, a bamboo reed fastened with
clay to the top of the bottle serves as a stem. A
small hole drilled into the side of the bottle serves
to feed the bowl when exhausted. General aspect
of the smoker—beatitude in ebony. A gin goes
by and gazes wistfully on her lord and master.
Vision the third. A gin is diligently scraping
out an ink-bottle opium-pipe. The burnt and
blackened cinder-like remnants thus obtained she
carefully collects, dilutes with water and drinks.
Fact!
Imitation, then, is the necessary antecedent of
Originality. The blackfellow was Imitation ; the
gin was certainly Originality.

a 200-acre freehold and several children. When
his wife ran away with Goggles he somehow let
her carry off his farm, or sell it. But Broggles
was full of sand. He went to California, arriving
with only 20, but in a few years, working away
industriously, he had acquired a valuable farm, a
wife, and several children. Then he heard that
his old wife was deserted by Goggles, and he left
his Californian property in his second wife’s hands
and returned to Maoriland to disconsolate No. 1
and the new brood who called Goggles father.
Broggles only had <£lo, but he was full of sand.
He leased a place, working away industriously, and
saved up until he managed to buy it, doing this
in his wife’s name, because he was a good bit in
debt at the store. Then she led him a dog’s life,
and he went and took up with a Mrs. Doggies,
whose husband had run away with a dressmaker,
and Mrs. Doggies’ five existing children soon
became seven. The other day Broggles was work-
ing away industriously clearing timber, when a
tree happened to fall on him and out short a life
of public usefulness which isn’t often matched,
even in Maoriland. If the residents had given
him his due, there would have been a large funeral
and an elaborate tombstone with the inscription :
“Here lies Broggles. He was full of sand.” But
they were a stolid, agricultural community, and
the corpse was laid to rest without any fuss, and
Mrs. Doggies went to Wellington and took in
washing.

PRIN CE OF WALES HOTEL,
778 to 784 George-st., Haymarlset, Sydney.
HAVING Struck the first blow at the IDOL OF HIGH SKIRLING, he is determined to continue
his crusade of destruction against this fetish. P. H. L \ HKIN is satisfied v. ith small profits on
the genuine article. His system of buying in the bust HOME MARKETS, and IMPORTING,
affords him a margin of profit which, in other cases, goes to support the middleman—an item of con-
siderable magnitude, which, having slipped thro’ the fingers of the retailer, must inevitably emne from
the consumer’s pocket. This is not P. H. LARKIN’S mode of doing business. Ho is a DliiMCX*
DITOR TMR, and therein lies part of the secret of his unapproachably low prices.
One trial at the PRINCE OF WALES HOTEL will convince that P.R.L. cannot be
approached for CHEAPNESS or QUALITY.
