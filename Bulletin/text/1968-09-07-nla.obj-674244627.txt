If you have a worn old roof you probably
don't dare think about it. Until there’s
a storm in the middle of the night. Then
you worry. But someone’s found the
answer to your problem, with the most
versatile of all metals, Alcoa aluminium.
It's a good looking, neat fitting roofing
tile, called Permatile, made by Hunter
Douglas Ltd.,* from Alcoa aluminium.
Permatile roofs come in four smart
colours. Attractive, resistant to corrosion
and damage, the tiles fit neatly over the
top of your old roof.
This system avoids the mess normally
associated with roof replacement.
Because they’re made from Alcoa
aluminium these tiles won't crack, chip
or rust. This roof is only one tenth the
weight of a conventional tile roof and
reflects heat your house will be cooler
in summer, warmer in winter.
Maybe you're not re-roofing your home.
But you should ask about the advantages
of aluminium in any building products
you plan to use, or manufacture.
Call your nearest Alcoa Regional Sales
Office for the facts to get on top of your
building problem.

Truly ..
a great
Australian
‘dry red’
A most satisfying wine. Careful
blending of Cabernet Sauvignon
and Shiraz (Hermitage) varieties
to a traditional Yalumba blend
gives Galway Vintage a distinc-
tive character of its own.
Cabernet Sauvignon for full
bouquet and soft tannin; Shiraz
to impart a soft, round full
flavour. Culmination is a superb
'dry red', achieved by ageing,
"chateau" style, in oak casks.
Our reward is the pleasure you
derive from serving this true-to-
type great Australian dry red
to your friends.
CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE CABERNET
SAUVIGNON GRAPE
Superb quality but low yield
of j to I ton to the acre. A
small round black grape with
light bloom, soft texture and
tough skin. Ripens early on a
loose but small, often
winged, conical shaped
bunch. The leaf is small to
medium, 5-lobed, with regular
teeth and its over-lapping
lobes give a characteristic
appearance of five holes.

VERSATILITY
For such a compact calculator that multiplies... adds and
subtracts ... balances ... multiplies, and once again multiplies,
you’d think it would be cumbersome and hard to use!
But not Olympia’s RAS/3/12.
Simplicity of operation and inbuilt quality are essential characteristics of Olympia’s range of calculating machines.
Especially with RAS/3/12. From Germany’s largest manufacturers of typewriters and business machines, the RAS/3/12
has such envied features as automatic multiplication, continuous and accumulative, high capacity, 12 digits. Negative
items and credit balances are printed in red, clear, readable print, therefore the RAS/3/12 offers the facilities of a fast,
large-capacity, adding machine with automatic multiplication at a very competitive price.
Ideal for timber merchants, builders, printers, architects, excavators—anyone in the office can do invoice extension,
payroll calculations, estimating, etc., with the moderately priced RAS/3/12.
Call or phone today. The Olympia Sales or Machine Service Division will expertly advise on every aspect of your office

FADE-OUT
THE NATIONAL GALLERY of Vic-
toria, now in its new building, has got
off to a splendid start with its first
temporary exhibition, The Field, which
looks at work by some younger painters
and sculptors. There is also a handsome
catalogue, which has, however, an
omission.
Alongside the biography of Mel-
bourne artist Robert Hunter is a large
and visually satisfying area of white
with the explanation below: Due to the
close tonal relationships between white
and off-white in this painting, the
camera has been unable to produce an
image, and reproduction is therefore
impossible.
HIGH ART
SYDNEY’S Australia Square is im-
pressive, but it’s hardly cosy. The open-
square part is delightful and in spite of
some formality does not repel even the
lunchtime pie-eater. But the circular
tower building still seems forbidding to
many Sydney people. Although
strenuous efforts are being made to
make it a place where people feel at
home, it will be a long while before the
average person slips in and out of there
as easily as in and out of David Jones’,
or even the Art Gallery.
Last week saw the opening of two
exhibitions there — one by a Dutch
artist called Han Hulsbergen, the other
a memorial to Jawaharlal Nehru, which,
according to the Press release, is made
up of “1800 photographs, 30,000 words,
and includes manuscripts, letters, jewel-
lery, textiles, sculpture, furniture, cloth-
ing, and general objects of art.”
We’ve also been told that it isn’t
quite the spectacle it was when it
opened at Expo 67. It has been round
the world since then, and apparently
bits of it have been lost in transit,
among them a set of British Raj uni-
forms, a bronze bust of Nehru, and a
stone elephant.
But there is still 40 tons of it, and
once we had managed to penetrate
Australia Square’s security arrange-
ments and, more important, choose the
right lift, we found it impressive, des-
pite the absence of the stone elephant.
There is the extraordinary family
photograph taken during Nehru’s child-
hood — brooding Indian faces adorned
with handlebar moustaches, and every-
body dressed in tweed Eton suits with
plus-fours, and a phrase written by
Nehru himself in an article done under
a pseudonym in 1937: “Men like Jawa-
harlal, with all their capacity for great
and good work, are unsafe in a democ-
racy ... a little twist and Jawaharlal
might turn into a dictator, sweeping
aside all the paraphernalia of a slow-
moving democracy.”
There is Gandhi’s umbrella and an
incredibly tiny pair of rimless glasses,
also reputed to have been his, and a
piece of environ’mental art representing
Nehru’s years in prison.
Pictures of the prisons have been
enlarged and placed in a square
which simulates that feeling of confine-
ment very well, once one is inside it
looking at the bare stone slabs which
served as beds for the prisoners.
The exhibition, which traces Nehru’s
life and India’s struggle for indepen-
dence from 1880 to his death in 1964,
was produced at the National Design
Institute at Admedabad under the
supervision of Charles Eames, the
American architect and designer, and
material comes from Indian Govern-
ment collections, those of the British
Museum, the New York Public Library,
Han Hulsbergen ... viewing
and the Victoria and Albert Museum,
and fro'm family albums and news-
papers.
Australia Square is holding the exhi-
bition at the suggestion of the Indian
High Commission.
That’s in the less heady part of the
Australia Square the sixth floor
but the Han Hulsbergen exhibition is
in the rarefied atmosphere of the Sky-
walk on the 48th, and it takes $l, as
well as courage, to reach it.
But once there one can, we’re told,
buy a Hulsbergen work for a third the
price it would fetch in Europe. This
means prices range between $5O and
$375. Hulsbergen started out as a
representational painter, exhibited with
Picasso in London in the 19305, and
now works in wood, iron, plastic,
enamel, and concrete. Australia is
seeing his work because his son, Rod-
erick, a photographer, is living here
now, and Hulsbergen has been visiting
him and working on this exhibition,
entitled “Australiana.”
One piece of work, called “Composi-
tion in Wool,” was inspired by a wool
rug which Hulsbergen bought during
his stay here and chopped into little
pieces, to the temporary consternation
of his family. This is the Skywalk’s
first exhibition. Apparently, the Aus-
tralia Square people think the “three-
dimensional” character of Hulsbergen’s
work suits the grandeur of that $1
view.
WAKING UP BRISBANE
TRADITIONALLY, “Never on Sun-
day” has been Brisbane’s tune. For long,
the best thing to do in the sleepy city
on Sunday has been just that—sleep.
The choice for the more energetic has
been a picnic with Mum and the kids
in the Botanic Gardens or having a go
at the Corns spruiking in Centenary
Place.
Now, Lord Mayor Alderman Clem
Jones has opened up the way for all
that to become a horrific link with the
past. Last week he announced that,
effective immediately, theatres, includ-
ing drive-ins, theatre-restaurants, and
cabarets, could open on Sundays, and
charity concerts could be held. Aider-
man Jones said his reasons were that
there was not enough to do on Sunday
and that some places of entertainment
were already operating illegally on Sun-
days, making their control difficult.
Conditions to be imposed on the
Sunday entertainments were that they
all must close on the Sunday of the
Lord Mayor’s annual charity command
performance (which attracts some of
the nation’s top entertainers, giving their
services free), and one other Sunday
must be devoted to a charity benefit.
Then came the reaction from the
people who would provide the Sunday
entertainment. The Theatrical Em-
ployees’ Union, which has about 1000
members in Brisbane who would be
affected by the change, was not having
any of it at all until a new agreement
to cover Sunday work was thrashed out
with the theatrical employers. Hoyts
Theatres Ltd., which have three city
theatres and a drive-in, said, through
manager John Scott, that they’d have
to wait until agreement was reached
with the union before making any
decision on Sunday shows. Greater
Union, operating three city theatres,
were more definite, with a firm “never.”'
But even more muddled was the
future of Sunday performances by the
two theatre-restaurants, and the
cabarets, because of the State’s muddled
drinking laws which forbid licensed
premises to open, or to sell liquor on
Sundays.
It remains to be seen whether Bris-
bane’s Sundays have been dull because
that was what the law demanded or
because that was really the way Bris-
bane liked it.

CALLING FOR ENDURANCE
PETER O’SHAUGHNESSY’S latest
theatrical experiment, “9 O’Clock
Theatre,” at Sydney’s tiny Wayside
Chapel theatre, is something of an
endurance course for himself and
Christine Bartlett, the young actress
he’s chosen to partner him.
They are on stage almost continuously
throughout the program, switching from
the restrained melancholy of Marguerite
Duras’ “La Musica” to shrill masochism
in “Frenzy for Two” by Eugene Ionesco.
And none of it is made any easier
by the confines of the Wayside Theatre’s
small and difficult stage. But, fortun-
ately, Miss Bartlett is no stranger to
small theatres, having spent six months
touring Britain with a repertory com-
pany doing Shakespeare.
A New Zealander, she’s studied mime,
speech, and drama at the Guildhall
School, in London, and at present is
teaching by day at the children’s work-
shop, run by the Australian Theatre
for Young People. “Mime,” she says,
“is one thing that has been neglected
here. I’ve done a Commedia del Arte
piece on television since I’ve been here,
and I’d like to see more of it done.”
She also played the lead in “The
French Affair” at the Music Hall, at
Neutral Bay, the ingenue in “Pal Joey”
at the Menzies, the usual quota of
“Skippy” and “Homicide” episodes, and
some radio drama. And in 2|- years
here she has had enough w r ork to make
her change her mind about returning
to England.
OUTCASTS
MELBOURNE, even more than
Adelaide, has a curious desire for
respectability. The newspapers, almost
daily, are filled with stories about
dignitaries who have been ordered out
of hotel lounges for failing to wear ties,
jackets, or, in extreme cases, full-length
trousers. The situation has become so
bad that a columnist of the “Sun News
Pictorial,” Keith Dunstan, has formed
an exit club. In order to become a
member, one has to be ordered out of
a hotel or restaurant of distinction for
a fashion misdemeanor.
We asked Keith Dunstan why Mel-
bourne behaved in this manner. He
said: “The present fuss has been caused
by the polo-neck fashion. Hotels like
the Southern Cross won’t accept it.
They’re terrified of people who don’t
wear ties. They remember history. It
has been long recognised that people
without ties will do anything.”
He gave a list of the exit club’s
recent members. Barry Humphries.
This was a curious one —Humphries
refused to take off his hat in the lounge.
Judy Patching, the manager of the
Australian Olympic team, for wearing
shorts, Dr. F. H. Taft, a U.S. surgeon,
Judd Barnard, a U.S. film producer,
Pat Collins, a Hobart restaurateur, and
Jerry Samuels, of “The Other People,”
all for wearing polo necks.
So far, said Mr. Dunstan, there had
been one triumph. The Hotel Australia
now had an entry club and offered ta
take all members of the exit club.
However, The Bulletin found Keith
Dunstan in white shirt and tie, looking
sadly Flinders Street respectable. He
admitted self-consciously that he had
never been ordered out of a hotel.
A TOUCH OF OPTIMISM
SINCE John Heyer, one of Australia’s
pioneering film-makers, left this coun-

been back several times trying to raise
money to make an Australian feature

Last week he left once again for
England, with a little more optimism
than ever before, and plans to return
later this year, perhaps to begin work
on a film. “More investors seem will-
ing to take a chance this time, but
even if I manage to make this film,
one film certainly doesn’t mean the be-
ginning of an industry.
“That won’t happen until the Gov-
ernment helps with some sort of pro-
tection for Australian films, just as it
does with tariffs to protect other indus-

tries. Theatres must be required to show
a percentage of Australian films. Sub-
sidies are very nice, but they’re not
enough. The Government must say
‘we’re going to have an Australian film
industry’ and put up protective bar-
riers around it.” Heyer says that part
of his optimism springs from a “hope-
ful” interview with Dr. Coombs, chair-
man of the Australian Council, which
has announced its intention to help
film-makers.
If Heyer achieves his objective and
makes a film, it will be a treatment of
“one of the heroic episodes in Aus-
tralian development perhaps about
Leichhardt or somebody like him.” He’s
choosing this kind of theme because
of his disappointment at the lack of
publicity Australia receives abroad.
“The average Australian businessman
comes back appalled that’s why
they’re willing to put money into film,
because it is a good way to publicise
the country and develop trade.”
Heyer, who worked on “The Over-
landers,” one of the early films made
here, says the much-talked-about film
industry we once had was never finan-
cially viable. “They were absolute
gambles. Film-makers used to get priv-
ate investors interested, but they never
made money, because the Menzies. Go-
vernment had very little time for creative
cinema. So the writers and directors
moved away and achieved things for
other countries instead.”
Films Heyer has made in England
have won several international awards,
among them the Venice Grand Prix.
He has made documentaries for the
United Nations, for Shell International,
and has worked as a consultant for the
J. Arthur Rank Organisation. He is
confident that Australia, although lack-
ing in writers and directors, has the
necessary technicians and equipment for
a feature-film industry. “You can’t say
the population’s too small for a film
industry, because countries like Den-
mark have proved how well it can be
done,” he said.

OFF-LOADING
YOUR RUBBISH
POST HASTE
FOR SOME TIME now your corres-
pondent has been working on an inven-
tion. It is an invention that could sweep
the world, like putting black stripes
down the bonnets of motor-cars, or the
pantie stocking. It is the combination
rubbish-and-mail gadget, hereinafter
referred to as Cram.
Putting it in very simple terms for
the non-technical, Cram is divided into
two parts. On the top is a rubbish-tin.
On the bottom is a letterbox. In the
centre there is a ball-bearing swivel.
“We get such a lot of rubbish in the
mail!”
In between the two compartments there
are gravity-operated flanges. This means
that by a swift flick you can tip your
entire morning’s mail into the rubbish
compartment. The luxury version of
Cram will come with disposable paper-
bag inserts which will receive the
rubbish.
One is impressed with the need for
putting Cram. into early mass-
production by the depressing news
which came out in the Budget. While
most forms of PMG costs went up
higher rates for parcel post, higher
rates for private boxes, higher rates for
registered post and certified mail
bulk postage came down.
As you can imagine, the PMG looks
upon this with real happiness. The
PMG for some time has had special
arrangements for bulk mail. It quotes
for delivery to an entire mail district,
to the entire metropolitan area, to
country areas, or, far, far better still,
to every letterbox in the country.
Until now, only the Government has
been good enough to give them orders
like that, but some of the big retail
firms have covered two States in one
hit, and orders for half a million letters
are not uncommon. This is the sort of
market Cram is hoping to cash in on.
Now, under the Budget, the PMG is
really hoping to cash in on direct-mail
advertising. For example, the PMG
is now quoting 4c an ounce for the
first 25,000 letters, and 3c to 3.5 c for
over 100,000. Once the PMG really gets
into this business, the average letter-
box will not be able to stand the strain.
This getting at the householder
through his letterbox has become the
modern subtle method of attack
through the advertising agencies. It
is cheaper than buying TV com-
mercials. Several weeks back, when
working out specifications for Cram,
I took note of a morning’s mail

crafty; they get the names from unions,
trade organisations, trade newspapers,
electoral rolls, and so on. Indeed, some
even put out brochures on direct-mail
advertising. One came around recently
which pointed out that this type of
advertising had increased four times in
four years. It said that they could
provide addressograph lists of all
doctors, painters, garagemen, car-
penters, confectioners, you name it.
Even more crafty and heaven knows
how they do this one they offered
to provide income groups. For example,
they would produce lists of potential
customers with incomes over $lO,OOO
a year. Once on such a list, you are
unlikely to get off it. Therein lies the
real value in Cram. For many of the
names on the many lists it could con-
tinue to be useful even ten years after
death.
So far, the greatest victims of direct-
mail advertising are those involved in
wedlock and procreation. A friend of
ours has reported a sad experience. He
has built a house in one of the outer
suburbs. The first trickle began when
he paid his deposit on a block of land.
Then, when he received his loan from
the bank, there came the great litera-
ture tide.
That’s it, you see. His name was
available on the council records, and
he was gone a million. There were bro-
chures on all the various types of
fences —brick, wire, or wood; brochures
on wrought-iron gates, on furniture,
bedroom suites, gardening tools, motor-
mowers, ready-made garages, roll-type
doors, Venetian blinds, dream kitchens,
and lighting fixtures. The brochures
were particularly strong on lighting
fixtures.
There were gentlemen who wanted
to paint this still-unmade house, and
those who wanted to insure it. There
were the floor-tile men, the patio men,
the glaziers, and, seeing that the poor
fellow registered the house in both his
name and that of his wife, everything
came in duplicate.
The next surge came with the birth of
the baby. This was inevitable upon the
appearance of the birth notice, although
some firms with good MIS tactics even
send their literature upon registration
with the hospitals. Then come the
pamphlets for cribs, baby blankets, cots,
baby baths, nappy wash, and offers to
photograph baby “in rich, natural
color.” The insurance agents leave their
cards and tend to call in person.

When you’re not there, you lock your
home and your office.
When you shift, shouldn’t your move be
just as secure?
Your office equipment is an investment. You lock
valuable or confidential papers in a file or safe.
When you move, shouldn’t you take the same
precautions you take in the office? The same
holds true of your household furniture. It is
valuable to you, and you’d like to feel that it is
moved with security.
Now Wridgways offer ‘HOMEPACK’ con-
tainers, so that you can do just that lock the
doors just as you would at home or office.
The advantages are evident. No dirt, no moths,
no mildew. A minimum of handling. And no
chance of pilfering. Plus a great deal of privacy
and the strength and safety of the steel framed
containers. When you can have all these benefits
at no extra charge, shouldn’t you think
Wridgways whenever you move? Business or
personal. Only Wridgways offer the safety, the
security and the economies of ‘HOMEPACK’
containerised moving.
Don’t take chances. Take Wridgways. It’s the
only way to move.

THE FADS
THAT BLOOM IN
THE SPRING
IT’S SPRING . . . and the Sydney set
have worked the travel lust from their
system, excepting interior decorator
Leslie Walford, who is still at it, and
they’re all dying to hear what he’s got
to say about Peru. Meanwhile, there’s
been a sudden run on anti-wrinkle
cream for men, packed in potent black
boxes and promising that the new man
about town this spring will be “... calm,
confident, commanding. Everything’s
going for him. He stands out from the
crowd wherever he happens to be. The
man of the moment. You recognise
that man anywhere by his special air,
a biting citrus scent with tempting
touches of pine, amber, spice. Adven-
turous. Yet civilised, that man . . .”
Yeah, well, says MP John Barra-
clough, slumped in the corner of the
tearoom in Parliament House, in order
to be healthy a man’s gotta get a puff
up once a day with a five-mile run or
make love. Either’ll do. He ignites a
cigar, orders whisky and soda, it is
4 p.m. or thereabouts, and says he’s got
it all organised. So the scene from
hereon on Bondi Beach at 7 a.m., or
earlier if he can drag ’em there, is a
draft of Eastern Suburbs husbands sum-
moned by Mr. Barraclough’s cody
two rings on the telephone, and recog-
nisable by their unwashed, unshaven
appearance, and a special air that is
biting alcoholic fumes from the night
before. “My word yes, jogging is won-
derful for hangovers. You feel awful
for two miles, like you’re gonna die,
then you spew up and feel marvellous.”
Four miles up Bondi, along Tamarama,
there are 230 steps up here, which is a
test of gravity, down to Bronte, then
back home and a shower, and the
smell is awful. “The thing is, you’re
an awful long time dead, and while I’m
alive I want to be healthy, and that’s
what jogging does. We’re not cranks
like that Tatts crowd in the city who
get TV cameras there to film them.
Now then,” he lights a second cigar,
“have you got the names right? Denis
Cleary, the footballer, Andrew Becher,
his father was Admiral of the Navy ...”
It’s spring . . . and down in Double
Bay outfitter John Lane is pecking a
Bellevue Hill matron goodbye, lovely
to see you back, Mrs. G , and is
swinging on a leather thong what every-
one thinks is a monocle but is, in fact,
his newest imported accessory: a waist-
low magnifying glass. It terrifies waiters.
And Ron and Mickie, two local fun-
people, are here trying Pierre Cardin’s
new collapsible crab-like sunspecs,
which positively no one can be without
well, at the giveaway price of $26.50,
imagine and Ron turns away from
his reflection and says, does everyone
think the round ones do anything for
him? Mr. Lane is in agony. They will
pack ’em right over left, when he keeps
telling them it’s left over right. One
customer’s busted a pair already.
Mickie’s gone, oh, she was exchanging,
that’s all right. Next door, American
Jim Steiner, who is Women’s Outfitters,
drapes himself in the doorway with a
2yd.-long apple-green-and-white spotted
scarf round his neck, and Mr. Lane
says, oh, God, he’s at it again. It amuses
me, says, Jim, it amuses me . . .
It’s spring . . . and everyone’s open-
ing. There is the unforgettable party at
D’Arcy’s, the new Paddo restaurant
with no, not wallpaper, darling, real
linen imported from England. Six
dollars and something a yard. Denis
Bellotte did the decor, and everyone’s
raving about it. Well, what they can
see of it at the first opening: 500 people
crushed cheek-to-cheek where 250
should be. Everyone gets there, think-
ing, it’s a restaurant, there’s bound to
be food. There are nibbles. A certain
faction leave for one of the new illegal
drinking bars in Kings Cross. The next
opening is dinner a week later. Full
black-tie job. Fifty-minute wait between
courses, and door-knobs falling off
everywhere. However, things are now
on even keel.
Barry Humphries opens and, ye gods,
the Tivoli’s like an ice-box. Madame
Lamotte, Australia’s leading milliner,
promises to open with Lady Lloyd
Jones doing the honors. Actually she
doesn’t. Don’t believe a word, say her
staff, till it’s in black and white.
“America Hurrah” does its one-night
stand, and, phooey, who says the tickets
are free? A certain well-known gentle-
man in the art world says to a certain
well-known lady in the socialite orbit,
if you give a donation I’ll send tickets.
Fred Williams invites everyone to come
up and see his etchings, at Rudy
Komon’s gallery, and launch his new
book called “Fred Williams’ Etchings.”
And here they are, sipping aperitifs,
hoping Fred’U give them a copy free.
Give-away? Rudy Komon nearly faints.
Sale-away is more like it. At $9.50, and
5000 copies to shift, he’s not giving any-
thing away. It is his first venture into
publishing, and will probably be his
last.
And down at the Dandy Dog bou-
tique they’re flogging chockies for dog-
gies. They’re great favorites at 60 cents
a drum. Yewmans, says the assistant,
can eat ’em.
Well, it’s spring.


THE UNKNOWN LAND OF AUSTRALIA
Comment by‘Observer’
IT SEEMED “inconceivable” to a visit-
ing American professor last week that
while one Australian university was now
setting up a school in American studies,
no Australian university had yet set up
a school of Australian studies. The
professor, Norman Pearson, head of the
Yale School of American Studies, was
attending a five-day conference on
American studies at the University of
Sydney. It might have seemed equally
inconceivable to him that there has
probably not yet been even a five-day
conference on Australian studies at an
Australian university.
The arguments he used, if they had
been used by an Australian, were of
the kind that some kinds of Australian
intellectuals have long since learned to
dismiss as “parochial.” Suggesting that
a School of Australian Studies should
include courses on Australian history,
literature, art, economics, and politics
so that, it would break across the tradi-
tional disciplines, he then said: “You
have to understand yourself, your cul-
ture, your history, your art, everything
that has made your country what it is,
so you can better understand other
people.” What made his argument even
more improbable to our present set of
self-evident truths was that he included
New Zealand with Australia as a field
for study. Adding improbability to im-
probability, he then suggested that the
Australian Government should subsidise
the establishment of schools of Aus-
tralian and New Zealand Studies in
America. He might as well have finished
the job and also suggested that we
should assist their establishment in
Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia,
and the Philippines as well.
It is true that it is now almost a
couple of decades since sectional studies
in Australian history, literature, art,
economics, and politics began to become
respectable in the universities. But what
has been lacking has been the kind of
whole view that in academic terms is
likely to occur only if “Australia”
becomes an acknowledged “subject,” as
respectable as the others, and equally
offering opportunities for career ad-
vancement and reputation. Failing this,
much academic work will remain
scrappy and disconnected.
Professor Pearson was taking a cos-
mopolitan view when he made his sug-
gestion that by understanding ourselves
we might better understand other
people. As it is, we still show an intel-
lectual tendency to consider our own
experience as meaningless: culture has
to be learned off, as if we were not part
of it, so that we can understand “over-
seas.” But this is likely to leave us
understanding neither ourselves nor
“overseas.” We understand nothing. We
just learn things off, and make judg-
ments of ourselves and our performance
by the extent to which we can compare
them with something “overseas.” But
we may not understand even what we
are comparing ourselves with.
How much can a people know of
other things if it knows little of itself?
To try to develop theories of the tex-
ture of Australian life may be a better
way to understand the Western civilisa-
tion of which we are a part, or even
the human experience itself, than to
learn off something or other that to us
is not quite part of our own life. In
this way, greater concentration on Aus-
tralia can lead to a greater interest in
the world. It can also, as Professor
Pearson suggested, lead to a greater
interest in history, or literature, or
politics. Sometimes it is by breaking
“subjects” up that one reinvigorates
them.
Of course, to open up a new aca-
demic subject, and call it “Australia,”
is harder than learning off one of the
old subjects. It might be of some use to
accompany such a move by setting up
more Schools of American Studies in
Australia, so that we could at least
begin by considering how the Americans
went about studying themselves. It
could also be a good idea to set up a
school or two of Latin-American
Studies, so that by increasing our
knowledge generally of the European
colonisation of the Americas we could
look at ourselves on a compare-and-
contrast basis.
However, the best of all ways of
stimulating interest in Australian
Studies might be to take up Professor
Pearson’s suggestion that the Australian
Government should assist in their estab-
lishment in America. Once the Ameri-
cans had had a go at us, we might
acquire more confidence in the belief
that'we were worth studying. We might
even have a clearer idea of how we
should go about it.
One of our characteristics that at
present dumbfounds some Americans
when they come to Australia is our
comparative lack of interest in our-
selves, compared with the American
obsession about the nature of Ameri-
cans. With this is connected their pri-
vate contempt for the low quality of
our political life. Even Americans who
despair of the quality of their own
political life can cheer about it a bit
when they contrast ours with theirs.
Yet it is not likely that the standard
of our politics will improve without
vigorous improvement in the discussion
of Australian life by intellectuals and
academics. It can be equally surprising
to us that visitors from South-East Asia
can find us interesting in ways we have
not ourselves imagined. Perhaps it will
only be an interest in Australia by
people “overseas” that will finally make
Australians interested in themselves.
WHEAT, THE SEED OF REVOLT
Comment by Alan Reid
THE REBEL FLAG was hoisted in
the Country Party last week in the first
challenge for years to the dominance
of Country Party Leader John
McEwen. The challenger was Don
Maisey, 53, Western Australian farmer
and grazier and CP MHR for Moore.
The reason for the rebellion is the
Govern'ment’s proposed wheat stabilis-
ation. Under it, the home consumption
price for wheat rises by six cents a
bushel, but the subsidy over the next
five seasons is to be reduced to $6B
million compared with the $95 million
over the previous five-year period.
The Minister for Primary Industry,
Douglas Anthony, claims that growers’
income will be a little more than under
the present scheme.
But Robert King, CP MHR for
Victoria’s wheat-growing seat of
Wimmera, and other CP members
claim that wheatgrowers will receive
less and become the only group in
Australia in modern days to have their
incomes reduced by statute.
For McEwen the danger is not only
in the opposition developing within
his Party to the wheat-stabilisation
proposals. Maisey has challenged
what was fundamental in the McEwen
policy the proposition that the
interests of manufacturers and farmers
could be welded compatibly.
Maisey, a former member of the
Australian Wheat Board and one of
the best-informed men in the Parlia-
ment on wheat he was a signatory
to the ff rs t w heat deals with Corn-
munist China had taken a tough

McEwen’s Country Party followers are
directing attention to something which
McEwen has kept largely under wraps
in his own Party his tariff policy,
which goes against the grain of
Country Party policy.
The Country Party, believing that
costs of primary producers are
adversely affected by high tariffs, is
traditionally a low-tariff Party. Its
policy is to give protection only to
industries which show efficiency.
McEwen, with a boldness that no
CP Leader has ever matched, has
taken the view that Australian citizens
are an Australian farmer’s best and
most reliable customers. Without
employment in factories, Australia
could not mount the immigration
program that it has now sustained for
years, nor could it develop on the
scale that McEwen visualised.
Consequently he has taken the view
that tariff-making should have a social
content, and that an industry should
be judged on its capacity to provide
jobs as well as by its efficiency.
Maisey said protection of the ineffi-
cient was justified by its supporters on
three grounds: (1) We needed popula-
tion, and primary industries could not
provide employment for the size of
population we wanted. (2) An expan-
sion of our primary production may
have meant a fall in the prices for wool,
wheat, etc., on the world markets. (3)
Industries were like babies. Just as we
would shelter an infant so we have to
shelter an infant industry.
Said Maisey, “If Honorable Mem-
bers take the trouble to look around
they will see an awful lot of 40-, 50-,
and even 60-year-old infants still suck-
. ing up this protection in Australia
today. Tariff protection for the ineffi-
cient has pulled down and crippled the
efficient, who finish paying the greater
part of the bill. It is not widely under-
stood that exporting industries, unlike
other groups in the community, are
unable to pass on the high prices
resulting from tariff protection.”
For the first time for many years,
McEwen has apparently found himself
confronted by a CP member who
refuses to be intimidated. Only a week
previously, Maisey had walked out of
a Country Party meeting which was
discussing wheat, saying that he was
not going to be gagged by some state-
ment made in confidence about wheat.
In last week’s meeting he announced
what he intended to say on tariffs, and
indicated that nobody was going to shut
him up on this subject nobody.
There are echoes of Maisey’s com-
plaints in the statement by the CP
MHR for Calare, John England, that
it is time secondary industry pulled up
its socks and made a greater drive for
efficiency, a statement applauded by lan
Pettitt, CP MHR for Hulme, N.S.W.
It will be interesting to see if
McEwen, whose views have dominated
the Country Party for years past, can
contain and subdue both the rebels and
the potential rebels.

AUSTRALIA
Getting defence on a proper basis
A THREE-PART, 80-page document
marked top secret, which was distributed
by Cabinet two weeks ago, may provide
the basis for the Australian Govern-
ment’s return to coherent defence and
foreign policies. It may also provide a
basis in which present differences of
approach within the Government can
be resolved. The document is the
“fundamental strategic reassessment”
that Prime Minister Gorton has been
talking about for some time, but it is
known as “The Strategic Basis” (or
“The Basis”) in the Defence and Exter-
nal Affairs Departments where it was
prepared.
Mr. Gorton is getting in early with
his own views on defence, although
Cabinet policy will not be resolved until
Defence Minister Fairhall returns from
America. In the House of Representa-
tives last week Mr. Gorton gave a sig-
nificant indication of his developing
approach to future defence policy. The
amount spent on defence would, he said,
“grow in volume” over the years ahead,
and “Australia’s capacity to fight will
increase,” but the emphasis seemed to
come in his warning that “there are
many competing needs,” such as popu-
lation increase, industrial development,
improvement in education, and the
eradication of poverty. Then followed
the sentences which showed how the
Prime Minister saw things: “Under pre-
sent international circumstances we do
not intend to sacrifice these other needs.
We do not intend to seek guns instead of
growth at the cost of stunting our
growth . . . the cost of defence will grow
and this will be regarded as one import-
ant need among many.”
The 80-page strategic basis is said
to present a quite optimistic view. It
is said to postulate a fuzzing of the situ-
ation in South Vietnam, with neither
side achieving its objectives, at least
within several years. It argues quite
firmly that whatever the outcome in
Vietnam, the Americans are likely to
maintain a position of military power
on the mainland of South-East Asia. In
any case, they believe the Government
of Thailand will be able to withstand
any pressures against it, without the
need for assistance on anything like the
scale of Vietnam. Laos, however, might
go to the North Vietnamese. In
Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia
“The Basis” believes that peaceable
nationalist Governments are well en-
trenched and give no cause for Aus-
tralian concern.
The relevance of China is down-
graded. “The Basis” does not take very
seriously the strength of the ideological
factor in its foreign policy and it thinks
that the Chinese bomb will be cared
for by the Americans. Otherwise,
Defence Minister Fairhall meets U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk in
Washington last week. Mr. Fairhall is there to take delivery of the first of
the Fills, a key factor in Australia’s defence
changes in the region will be slight and
not necessarily threatening.
The review thus provides support for
Mr. Gorton’s view that “under present
international circumstances,” to use his
Budget-speech phrase, there are no
readily perceivable threats to Australian
security which require expanded de-
fence expenditure. This comes to the
crux of the present debates within the
cabinet and the Government parties
about defence policy.
At one level this debate has been
about “threats.” Mr. Gorton appears to
have alternated in his assessment of
threats. Around the time of the John-
son resignation speech, he appears to
have been very pessimistic, describing
Australia as being “for the first time in
its history relatively defenceless.” He
also spoke of the need, to take “the first
shock of any attack upon us” and
made analogies with Israel. In this
pessimistic phase he also spoke of Aus-
tralia’s impotence, saying, for instance,
in an interview with the BBC: “We
haven’t got the capacity to be ourselves
a power in Asia or anywhere else. We
are 12,000,000 people. What is the
population of London?” Australia’s
need to shelter behind an American
shield was also the theme of his early
musings. It was this which earned him
a reputation for “Little Australianism.”
As a pessimist about “threats” to
Australian security, Mr. Gorton was
supported strongly by Mr. W. C. Went-
worth and a number of Government
members, who, after the Tet offensive
in Vietnam and Johnson’s stand-down,
came to believe that “Asia is finished.”
He first gave articulate voice to his
misgivings at the now-famous Govern-
ment Parties’ meeting on May 8, where
he said that the “forward defence”
policy, though once legitimate, might
have to be re-examined. He started to
speak of the need to get absolutely iron-
clad guarantees of American back-up
for Australian troops in South-East
Asia. This was the period when the
“fortress Australia” idea, or other varia-
tions on a policy of pull-back, were
floated on every opportunity.
But, following his visits to the U.S.
and South-East Asia, Mr. Gorton
appears to have been detached from
the ranks of the threat-pessimists.
The strategic view contained in “The
Basis” is likely to confirm him in his
new confidence in the Australian
security situation.
External Affairs Minister Hasluck
told Parliament last week that he had
sent a memorandum to senior officers
of his department telling them that
The Bulletin’s account (August 24) of
the Government Parties’ last meeting on
foreign policy was “quite inaccurate,
both in fact and in spirit,” and he also
said that reports on differences between
himself and the Prime Minister “are
equally misleading.”
It is true that differences between
Mr. Gorton and Mr. Hasluck over the
value and reliability of the External
Affairs Department’s advice have not
got on the public record, but a number
of other differences have, as have differ-
ences in approach between Mr. Gorton
and Mr. Fairhall. This has been a situa-
tion in which the Prime Minister has
said one thing and his External Affairs
Minister or his Defence Minister has
said another.
The future of the Australian com-
mitment to Malaysia/Singapore was
the first example of this process. Mr.
Hasluck said in Kuala Lumpur in Feb-
ruary this year that the British with-


drawal date of 1971 “is not a point of
timetable as far as we are concerned.”
It was “a date of significance (only)
to the British.” In assertive vein he
said: “We have to work out our own
relationships . . But on March 28, in
Wellington, where in a joint interview
with Mr. Holyoake it was said that Aus-
tralian troops would stay until 1971,
Mr. Gorton said: “It is too soon to
indicate what could happen after 1971.”
There was not, as Mr. Hasluck had sug-
gested, an “unequivocal commitment.”
This has reflected the broader differ-
ence of view between Mr. Gorton and
Mr. Hasluck about Australia’s regional
role. Mr. Gorton has said that Australia
is “not a power,” and has expressed
strong dispositions toward adopting a
policy of non-involvement. He has,
therefore, been labelled a “retrac-
tionist.”
Mr. Gorton first publicly stated this
view at a National Press Club luncheon
on June 20: “There has been a funda-
mental change in the basis on which
Australia’s strategic planning has for
more than two decades been predicated.
Clearly the concept of forward defence
—valid when based on participation
with other forces, and forces of a major
power needed minute examination
. . . any contribution by us to the
stability of the region after 1971 can-
not be fixed until we know what Britain
will do . . .”
But Mr. Hasluck has never, appar-
ently, wavered as a regionalist. A sum-
mary of his contribution to the closed
session of the SEATO Council on
April 3, released by the Department of
External Affairs, reported: “Mr. Has-
luck pointed out there was considerable
scope for security co-operation beyond
national and treaty lines . . . Mr. Has-
luck spoke also of the need to increase
the momentum of regional co-operation
in all fields. In South-East Asia there
were now established nation States with
a strong community of interest in
stability and security. Not only was no
single nation able adequately to defend
itself against the continuing pressure of
Communist expansion, but none could
be indifferent to a subversive threat to
any of its neighbors, for that threat
brought insecurity closer to its own
borders. It was important, therefore,
that security be seen in regional terms
Perhaps the fundamental difference
between the Prime Minister and Mr.
Hasluck (and Mr. Fairhall) has been
one of general approach. Mr. Gorton
has a rather narrow approach to defence
and foreign policy, seeing it almost
entirely in terms of coping with
“threats,” and threats of attack which
are fairly clearly foreseeable and defin-
able.
Mr. Fairhall is concerned that
defence should provide for Australia to
cope with a more general condition of
regional insecurity: “Ours is a big coun-
try, far away from our friends. We are
living in one of the most disturbed areas
of the world. These circumstances im-
pose tremendous responsibilities and
burdens on us.” But only Mr. Hasluck
seems to have a feel for the positive
outgoing value of military potential as
an instrument of diplomacy and
national self-expression,
THE PRIME MINISTER
A LATE ELECTION?
EARLY ELECTIONS or not? That is
the perpetual talking point in Can-
berra. It still seems to be a matter of
the Government keeping its options
open. During the week there were a
number of developments which in-
creased the intensity of speculation. One
was an opinion poll, suggesting that the
Government could be confident of get-
ting back with its present majority in-
tact. Another was the introduction of
time-saving procedures into Parlia-
mentary debate, suggesting that Mr.
Gorton was hurrying to get his essential
legislation through in order to make
time for a November campaign.
Hardworking Party Whip, Mr.
Dudley Erwin, was busy keeping his
Party subjects from “yabbering over
time,” having announced a strict limit
of 20 minutes per speaker and a tighter
list of speakers.
Prime Minister Gorton, so everyone
was saying, was doing much better in
Parliament. He was starting to look like
a Prime Minister in action. “He can do
quite well when he exerts himself,” said
one of his colleagues. And he was exert-
ing himself. He hit heavily at the Labor
Party for their attempt to draw an
analogy between the Russian suppression
of Czechoslovakia and American policy
in Vietnam. His speeches on the Budget
and Czechoslovakia were well received.
Yet other portents did not suggest
the coming of a poll. The Government’s
new tough line toward wheat-farmers
did not seem calculated to win many
friends, and it predictably sparked new
Prime Minister Gorton ... doing well
in Parliament
flames of rebellion for Mr. McEwen in
the Country Party. On another flank
the Government is incurring a great
deal of hostility from the Senate side of
the Parliament building, where the DLP
have a new Party room. Their office is
equipped with four handsome swivel
chairs and one of Parliament’s innumer-
able bush landscapes to hang on the
wall. The painting is titled “The
Approaching Storm,” and the occupants
show it to visitors, and they chuckle.
DLP Leader Gair downed the Govern-
ment six times the week before last and
his Party is working hard on a system-
atic effort to prevent the Government
calling new elections. “We’re bloody
broke,” he says earthily about elections.
Speculation in Canberra a couple of
weeks ago was that the Czech affair in-
creased the likelihood of an early elec-
tion. The argument was that this
focused public attention on defence and
foreign policy where the Government
has been traditionally strong and the
Labor Party weak. But 1968 is different
from every other year since the Liberal-
CP Government came to power in 1949.
The Government’s foreign policy is in
a state of flux and uncertainty. If the
Labor Party can still be hammered for
the extent of Leftist influence through
the machine, the Government is for
the first time acutely vulnerable because
of its difficulty in defining its policy
response to the changes in our regional
environment.
The pace of Mr. Gorton’s Govern-
ment is such that his public servants pre-
dict that though he may have been
thinking during May and June about
an election in November, he will now
be beginning to think of March. They
say he wants to have defence cleared up
by then and plans for reformed social
services made concrete so that he has
something hard to campaign with. But
the cynics and they are the majority
say that in fact this will drag right
out into next year. So in the final
event there won’t be an election until
there absolutely has to be one in
November, 1969.
CAIRNS AND CALWELL
WHOSE LAST HURRAH?
SPEAKING for a much earlier Arthur,
Lord Tennyson wrote: “The sequel of
today unsolders all the goodliest fellow-
ship of famous knights . .
Dr. Jim Cairns’ proposed nomination
for the Federal seat of Melbourne, until
then presumed to be Mr. Arthur Cal-
.vell’s property, did not proclaim the
political Morte d’Arthur as one morn-
ing Daih hopefully suggested, but his
gauntlet’s loud thud was the prelude
to a clash of political steel across the
boards of the Victorian Labor Party’s
round table. It announced mortal com-
bat, and with the entry of some Cairns
supporting Federal-executive members
in the fray, Mr. Calwell was edged
much closer to his eternal lack of
reward.
Dr. Cairns disclosed his intention to


Dr. Cairns. .. Galahad of the Left
seek endorsement little more than a
month after the plan for electoral re-
distribution was announced. His own
seat, Yarra, abolished under the new
allocation, will be divided between Mel-
bourne, a strong Labor area, and Koo-
yong, an unimpeachably Liberal pre-
serve.
Apart from the isolated wish of Party
vice-president George Crawford for
some compromise before the selection
committee makes its invidious choice in
October, it seemed only barely prob-
able, five days after the announcement,
that an arrangement could be made.
The member for Melbourne since
1940, Arthur Calwell has no intention
of standing down even for the Galahad
of the dissenting Left. “I will fight to
the last to represent the seat I have
always represented,” he said in Can-
berra last week. “I intend to keep on
surviving. I regard this as a challenge—
it will be the survival of the fittest.”
Dr. Cairns’ intention was announced
a month before nominations close, so
it appeared that he had not given seri-
ous consideration to any of the five
electorates which have been canvassed
as alternative possibilities for him.
There would seem to be a number of
sound reasons for this. First, he thinks
he has the numbers on the executive,
which, no matter how loyal to Mr.
Calwell, need him to articulate the
socialist line and, more importantly, to
keep knight-errant Whitlam at bay.
Second, Dr. Cairns is involved in the
particular problems of his electorate,
and identifies with the electors who
have returned him since 1955. His
G. D. H. Cole brand of compassionate
socialism, his open-house hospitality,
and his egalitarian manner have won
a core of followers who regard him as
a uniquely principled politician. At
times the loyalty approaches reverence.
Apart from Dr. Cairns’ well-wooed
Yarra voters, 19,000 of whom will form
part of Melbourne, he also has many
friends in Mr. Calwell’s old electorate.
Three of these branches have already
Mr. Calwell ... Morte d’Arthur?
passed motions supporting his candid-
acy.
Third, he must be aware that his
politics of high aspiration have their
limitations as vote-catching material.
While three of the possible seats he
might have nominated for are safe
Labor areas, they might not stand firm
under a concerted campaign against
him by Liberal candidates with DLP
support. He can be portrayed as the
future leader of the Opposition, who is
hostile to the American alliance and a
danger to Australian security. Having
assumed a mission to give dissent a
respectable and established place, his
almost daily speeches from every con-
ceivable platform would have to be
curtailed to preserve local support. He
could not present himself as the alterna-
tive Labor Leader if the parish pump
always needed attention.
Since reports • that Federal Labor
Party heavyweights are threatening to
reverse an unfavorable decision to
Cairns, his local supporters are confi-
dent of his success in October, when
the selection committee meets. How-
ever, the joust has complications. The
strongest argument of the Cairns people
—that Mr. Calwell has had his day,
despite his past service, and that Dr.
Cairns is entitled to the secure power-
base of a leader may not get the
expected hearing.
There has been recent talk that Dr.
Cairns is not the untainted hero of
before. His attitude to Party reform,
while less draconic than Whitlam’s, is
still not the same as that of the key
individuals on the executive. Proximity
to the leadership might make him more
flexible on a number of issues: an
unsavory thing to Party purists.
Then, again, Mr. Calwell has firm
friends on the executive, who, while
well disposed to Cairns, may think that
Calwell, as member for Melbourne for
28 years, not only deserves the respect
due to an old warhorse, but that his seat
has contributed more electors to the
new division.
They may be looking ahead. If, or
when, Whitlam loses the coming elec-
tion, Cairns may also present problems.
Besides, he is not the only capable man
on the Left.
If that was the case, Mr. Calwell
would not have to say as did Tenny-
son’s Arthur: “I perish by this people
which I made tho’ Merlin sware
that I should come again to rule once
more.”
NEW SOUTH WALES
DISCOVERING COOK
IT SEEMS a bit unfair to knock the
N.S.W. Government’s plans to cele-
brate in 1970 the bicentenary of Cap-
tain James Cook’s landing at Botany
Bay; New South Wales is the only
State so far doing anything about it.
But what New South Wales seems to
have in mind is not so much a cele-
bration of the bicentenary as a re-
enactment of the last major historical
celebrations the sesquicentenary of
Governor Phillip’s landing—in 1938.
So far, we are to have in 1970 a
Pageant of the Pacific, a re-enactment
of Cook’s landing at Kurnell, and a
Venetian carnival on Sydney Harbor at
night. And what did they have in
1938? A Pageant of Nations, a re-enact-
ment of Phillip’s landing (for con-
venience’s sake they had it at Farm
Cove instead of Sydney Cove) and a
Venetian carnival on Sydney Harbor.
The chairman of the official com-
mittee is the Chief Secretary, Mr.
Willis. Mr. Willis has recently been
busy banning “America Hurrah” and
sending detectives chasing actors
through theatres. It seems that when
the Liberals finally got back into power
in New South Wales, Mr. Willis be-
lieved we could all go back to . the
golden years of the ’thirties when
“Tubby” Stevens was Premier, banning
plays was an everyday affair, and Vene-
tian carnivals sounded pretty exciting.
It hardly seems surprising that the
program so far announced has not
fired much interest elsewhere. Queens-
land is reportedly “very enthusiastic,”
but the N.S.W. Premier, Mr. Askin,
has failed to get any response from the
Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton.
The only sign of interest from else-
where was the Catholic Archbishop of
Melbourne, Archbishop Knox, suggest-
ing that the Pope might be invited here
for the Cook bicentenary. Pope Paul
being expected to watch a Venetian
carnival on Sydney Harbor could set
ecumenism back 100 years, and per-
manently damage Australian-Italian
relations.
It may be 200 years since Cook dis-
covered Australia, but Australia has
been slow in discovering Cook. Phillip,
the first Government official, has always
received a great deal more attention,
since these things are in the hands of
officials, than the explorer. Compared
with the 1938 celebrations, the 150th
anniversary of Cook’s landing at Botany

Bay was noted with a routine ceremony
at Kurnell, an event worth two para-
graphs in the papers of the day.
Australia, in April, 1920, was much
more interested in celebrating the sec-
ond Anzac Day, and also the visit of
the Prince of Wales.
However, the Sydney afternoon
papers have now taken up his cause
with enthusiasm. Nearly every page of
the “Daily Mirror” has been a historical-
feature page, with accounts of the
three voyages running parallel with
similar accounts in the “Mirror’s”
stablemate, “The Australian.” For those
buyers of the “Mirror” who read with
difficulty, the paper offered simul-
taneously a comic-strip version of the
voyages.
The “Mirror’s” afternoon rival, “The
Sun,” intrepidly launched its own
endeavor two days after the “Mirror.”
“The Sun’s” account was written by
their yachting writer, Lou d’Alpuget,
but although he bravely set sail, he was
only at the end of the first voyage,
with two more to go, by the time the
“Mirror” had finished with Cook and
was back to normal with the “uncen-
sored biography of the Beatles.” On
N.S.W. Chief Secretary Eric Willis . ..
back to the ’thirties
August 24, “The Sun’s” stablemate,
“The Sydney Morning Herald,”
weighed-in with a feature on Cook
sailing from Plymouth.
But is the co'mmittee organising the
1970 celebrations grateful for all this
free publicity? Not particularly. They
are inclined to think that with 20
months to go the papers have made
their run a bit early. After all, they
can’t keep going over the same
ground; there is a limit to the number
of times that the heading “Sailors dally
on the islands of love” will attract the
attention, even of “Mirror” readers.
However, the committee is already
meeting regularly and a citizens’
council, headed by Mr. Asher Joel,
MLC, the man who has made the
Waratah Festival what it is today, will
begin work this month. There is still
the possibility that the only tried-and-


true idea that didn’t co’me off in 1938
a royal visit might come off
this time and there is the intention
of a permanent memorial to Cook.
The hope is that this will be a mari-
time museum in the Customs building
at the Quay, but with Minister for
Works, Mr. Davis Hughes, sitting
beside Mr. Willis on the conYmittee
there is always the chance that it
might be an opera house.
DOCTORS
NON-COMMUNICATION
HOW DO DOCTORS communicate
with the public? Can a doctor afford
to remain anonymous? If the Medical
Practice in the Community conference
in Canberra last week was any guide,
the doctors certainly intend to remain
anonymous for some time yet, and
apparently don’t want to communicate
with anyone much.
These two questions cropped up on
the first day, in fact, at the first session
of the conference. By the end of the
week, the 58 delegates seemed no closer
to answers. The delegates emerged as
the shyest publicity seekers ever to have
conferred in Canberra.
The conference was convened to de-
termine the future patterns and needs
of medical practice in Australia. The
Australian National University, which
has considered setting up a teaching
school in medicine, intended to use the
conference’s considerations to help them
reach final decision on whether to go
ahead.
The conference seemed to present a
marvellous opportunity to tell the public
something about the future of medicine
in Australia, how it would be organised,
its complexities, sophistication, and cost.
The delegates were not restricted to
medical men from all fields, but in-
cluded social scientists and economists.
But instead of using the opportunity to
inform, the conference decided to meet
in private and release a statement at
the end of each day.
The first Press statement at the end
of the first day said: “The question of
communication with the public was also
raised. In an affluent society, mass
media has a great influence on people’s
understanding of medical problems,
and doctors should learn how to make
use of these media to communicate to
the public. Could the doctor afford to
remain anonymous?” And, as if that
didn’t unsay enough, the first words
uttered at the first Press conference
within 30 seconds of the issue of the
statement, were to the effect that no
one, unless he gave his permission,
should be quoted in the Press state-
ments.
The task of communications with the
public of Australia seemed even more
difficult with the release of key papers
on which all discussions were supposed
to have been based. All the overseas
media representatives received a sum-
mary of the papers about a week before-
hand. The Australian media, which the
doctors themselves declared they wanted
to use, got nothing until the day of the
conference so that journalists found
when they arrived that they had a few
hours in which to read and understand
120,000 words of detailed information.
Still, they are probably used to much
the same sort of offhand treatment in
their local doctor’s waiting-room.
ADELAIDE
NEW DEVELOPMENT
THE PUZZLE in Adelaide last week
was why Premier Hall was re-
arranging the Department of Industrial
Development that his predecessor,
Labor leader Don Dunstan, had set
up as a way of getting industrial
expansion in South Australia.
Mr. Dunstan, when he was Premier,
had put in as Director of Industrial
Development Mr. Donald R. Currie
who had been general manager of
ICI in South Australia. Now Mr. Hall
has moved Mr. Currie into one part
of the industrial development job - —-
as Director of Industrial Research he
will be responsible for research
and made Mr. A. M. Ramsay (also
general manager of the S.A. Housing
Trust) the Director of Industrial Pro-
motion responsible for promotional
activities, which seems to put him in
the top seat, since he will be the
S.A. Premier Steele Hall ... shuffling
the jobs
man most directly in control of
specific negotiations. In addition, the
chairmanship of the advisory com-
mittee of leading businessmen was
taken away from Mr. Currie and
given to a past chairman of the Tram-
ways Trust, Mr. A. B. Barker.
As benefits an opposition, Mr. Dun-
stan’s Labor Party hammered away at
Mr. Hall in Parliament: Was there
now to be no full-time Director of
Industrial Development? Who would
be responsible for what? What was
going to happen to the Housing
Trust? Was the department now about
to be wrecked? Had Mr. Currie’s con-
tract been repudiated?
“Rubbish,” was Mr. Hall’s answer
to the last question. He then said that
Mr. Currie had asked to be relieved
of the chairmanship of the advisory
council, but he was less than clear
on the question of who would now
be running the Industrial Development
Department saying that he was Minister
of Industrial Development as well as
Premier, and both directors would be
responsible to him. He presented the
changes as a way of strengthening in-
dustrial and economic research and
defended them by saying that they were
necessary because of intense competi-
tion in the development field. But to the
followers of the Dunstan risorgimento
it was interpreted whether fairly or
not as a return to the old pals’
circuit of the Playford era.
DARWIN
NOWHERE TO GO
IT LOOKS AS though the people of
Darwin will have to stay at home if
war is declared. As Darwin’s con-
troller of civil defence, Mr. Dick
Webber, has said, “Where do people
have to go? In any case the Stuart
Highw'ay would he terribly congested if
everyone used it.” The Bulletin called
on the controller last week to find out
how he was getting on with his recent
appeal for more civil defence volunteers
to man Australia’s front door. Only
a dozen or so had turned up at a
demonstration of equipment, but the
controller thought that under the cir-
cumstances this roll-up was quite good.
Under what circumstances? Having to
compete with drinking, barbecues,
parties, beach girl.?.
Twenty-five volunteers have somehow
been recruited to fill the gap of former
volunteers who have gone south. When
The Bulletin asked the controller why
he didn't use the threat, of war as a
recruiting aid, he said that people
should know anyhow that civil defence
meant action in wartime. He said what
he wanted to get people used to was the
idea of civil defence as a peace-time
service for emergencies like aeroplane
crashes, people lost in the bush, floods,
hurricanes. “Something like this would
be excellent for recruiting,” he said,
“but we haven’t had a really good
hurricane since 1964.”
Even the optimistic controller thinks
it will take time to build up civil de-
fence in Darwin, the first dot on the last
domino. Things were better, he said,
at the time of confrontation with Indo-
nesia. Recruiting then picked up as
Darwin people remembered February.
1942, when Japanese bombers droned
over Darwin and leisurely dropped their
bombs.


Assignment for a company of uncommon enterprise:
Bring
in outback
iron ore.
Soon the world’s steelmakers will need
300 million tons of iron ore each year.
Happily there are still vast iron ore reserves
available, although many are in nearly in-
accessible areas—eight billion tons in Aus-
tralia alone. Dravo’s assigment: move into
the rugged Western Australia outback with
engineers, skilled labor, tons of material
and build one of the largest pelletizing
plants in the world.
The plant recently went on stream at
Dampier for Hamersley Iron Pty., Limited
and will produce 2,000,000 tons of pellet-
ized iron ore annually to help feed the
world’s steel mills.
Since entering the field, Dravo has be-
come the leading engineering and con-
struction organization with experience
both in beneficiation and agglomeration.
Dravo-built iron ore pelletizing plants, on
stream or under construction, are capable
of producing 30 million tons a year—a third
of the world’s capacity. All these plants
utilize the Dravo-Lurgi traveling grate
process.
A pelletizing plant makes use of only a
few of Dravo’s skills: engineering, plant
construction, design and project manage-
ment. Other Dravo assignments cover bulk
materials handling complexes, water and
waste treatment systems, conventional or
nuclear power plants, development of un-
derground and open-pit mine facilities,
dams and tunnels to capture and distribute
water resources. And these are just a few.
To learn more about Dravo, you are in-
vited to read the REVIEW, a quarterly
magazine. You may receive personal cop-
ies by writing Dravo Pty. Ltd., 30 Ord
Street, Perth or 49 York Street, Sydney.

INTERNATIONAL
CANDIDATES FOR CRISIS
As police converged on the con-
vention hall, Democrats hardly
got the welcome they expected
IT IS A RARE experience to watch
a great political party —the oldest in the
world, as the Americans love to claim’—
destroy itself in the space of five days.
But that is what happened in Chicago
last week and it will take more
than bands playing “Happy Days Are
Here Again” and the sight of Hubert
Humphrey accepting his Party’s nom-
ination to erase the memory.
Surely no party in its right mind will
ever dare to risk a public exhibition of
this kind again. What the worldwide
television audience saw last week, both
inside and outside the convention hall,
was a denial of everything that America
has always been supposed to be about.
It was a gift to America’s enemies
Mayor Richard Daley behaving just
like some Soviet thug, the police
advancing at 5 a.m. into a candidate’s
campaign headquarters and beating up
the staff, the drowning of dissent in
the convention hall by specially im-
ported municipal hirelings, the brutal
harassment of newsmen. Whatever the
Democratic Party may have done to
itself, it has certainly handed its
opponents their greatest propaganda
prize in years.
The story of the past few extraord-
inary months in American politics has
been, in some degree, of course, about
policies. But far more basic even than
dissent over Vietnam has been a general
sense of dissatisfaction with the way the
nation’s political system works. That
was what Robert Kennedy made the
underlying theme of his campaign and
it was what Senator McCarthy bravely
promised to go on harnessing even in
the moment of his defeat. On every
ground of good sense to say nothing
of idealistic principle—the one position,
therefore, that neither party could
afford to get into on the threshold of
the campaign was of seeming to embody
the traditional “smoke-filled-rooms”
image of America’s political process.
Yet last week that is what the Demo-
cratic Party did, and it seems only too
likely to rue the consequences for the
next four years.
“You know,” said Senator George
McGovern, one of the nominees, “I
think there is something almost obscene
about Presidential candidates going cap
in hand to one man to talk about what
100 delegates are going to do” and
you could sense the vibrations of the
answering chord across the nation.
Naturally, no one is pretending that
the Republican Party has suddenly be-
come the symbol of a new politics of
popular participation. But at least, if
only because of skilful stage manage-
ment, it avoided the kind of public pit-
falls —Mayor Daley unashamedly call-
ing the signals to the platform from
the floor, security men blatantly trying
to restrict communication between dele-
gates and newsmen that the Demo-
cratic Party fell into last week.
It will certainly take more than a
promise by Hubert Humphrey “to walk
the extra mile” in an effort to bring
the dissidents back into the Party to
obliterate the memory of incidents like
that. For the sense of revulsion and dis-
gust (felt not only within the Party
but very widely outside it as well) is
not going to be banished easily. Nor,
at least in the interests of the health
of the American political system, should
it be. For if there is to be any hope
of getting a new kind of responsiveness
into the process it may now depend on
the Democratic Party’s defeat in Nov-
ember.
For the moment that defeat looks
not so much probable as inevitable.
Hubert Humphrey, as he demonstrated
in his acceptance speech, is a politician
of cheerful resilience, but it is his mis-
fortune and that of the Party
that both their reputations should now
be indelibly tarnished as part of a
mosaic of police clubbing, delegates
brawling, and Party leaders mouthing
obscenities as decent men vainly tried
to protest at the violence.
What was written on the faces of
the victorious delegates in the con-
vention hall was not so much a failure
to understand the voices of useful pro-
test as a determination that they should
not be heard. Suddenly, as in a primi-
tive tribal society, it had become
necessary that the young should be
held down. And the Democrats pro-
ceeded to do that with as much energy
in the convention hall as Mayor Daley’s
police displayed outside in the streets.
The challenge that was being resisted
was to possession rather than to policy.
The world and the nation might
change, but this Party was going to
remain the same. And in making that
stand somehow personified in the
image of their own standard-bearer
the Democrats set themselves firmly
against the coming demographic tide.
By 1972, as the Census Bureau of
Statistics relentlessly forecasts, half the
American electorate will be under 30,
and at that time, if not before, the
Mayor Daleys of America will surely
be washed away.
As the Party (at least notionally) of
social change, the Democrats should
have seized their opportunity for de-
liverance this year, and there was a
flickering moment earlier in the summer
(when McCarthy and Kennedy be-
tween them were picking up a majority
of the popular vote in the Primaries)
when it looked as if it might. But
if only because of the vacuum left by
Kennedy’s death, the old traditionalist
forces with a hefty stake in maintaining
the status quo were able to show their
muscle. In doing so they may have
succeeded in giving Humphrey the
nomination, but they have also, one
suspects, deprived him of any chance
of election.
Whatever the Democratic Party has
owed over the years to its local political
bosses and machines, it has never be-

frequently far more dangerous than
wicked ones. Everyone knows that
Hubert Humphrey is a kindly, decent,
civilised man whose whole career, at
least until 1964, had been dedicated
to the furtherance of liberal and
humanitarian causes. Yet months ago
he seems to have made the deliberate,
if reluctant, decision that his only hope
of getting his Party’s nomination was to
place his candidature and his cause
firmly in the hands of the Party’s
power-brokers and Lyndon Johnson’s
henchmen.
The Vice-President did not want the
kind 0 f U gi yj brutal convention that
he got} but the fact has to be faced
that he himself made it inevitable .
Perhaps out of the old-time loyalty,
but more probably out of a newfound
timidity, he chose to identify himself
w j t h all the forces in the Party that
tbe voters themselves, in primary after
primary, bad made it only too clear
tbey wante d to be rid of. The result
was tben pre-ordained, and the Dele-
g a tion chairman of New Hampshire
(fittingly the State where Senator
Eugene McCarthy began his whole
campaign) found his way into a
Chicago police cell.
Humphrey has been the particular
victim of three men’s vanity. President
Johnson insisted on keeping him in the
Administration’s tutelage until the very
minute, a curious reward for
Humphrey’s loyalty through months
whe n his close friends wanted hhn to

And then Senator Teddy Kennedy,
although unwilling to run this year,
did not entirely discourage the Chicago
boomlet that depended on his name
until the morning of August 28. It
has been the measure of the Demo-
crats’ sense of plight that they should
even have considered inviting an un-
tested man of 36 to be their Presi-
dential candidate. That this should
have happened has been flattering to
him and his family. His advisers will
also have reflected that the attention
will have done nothing but good for
his chances when the Democrats ’may
have a better chance of carrying the
White House.
The third man to whom Humphrey
can feel less than indebted is Mr.
Richard Daley, Chicago’s mayor. It
was Daley who insisted that the Demo-
crats should convene in his city, what-
ever the threat of violence and what-
ever the armed forces required to
overawe it. Nothing could have been
better calculated to present the Party
to the world in precisely that predica-
ment of racial violence on which Nixon
is counting to win approval of his
kind of strong, conservative govern-
ment. That Daley should also have
indulged his whim to be kingmaker by
touting around for a replacement to
Humphrey either Kennedy or even
President Johnson if possible was
not unexpected, but it added to the
disarray. It has not been Senators
McCarthy and McGovern who have
been Humphrey’s worst enemies.
All of this will have given more
comfort to Nixon than the latest leads
awarded him by the opinion polls (he
was equally ahead of Humphrey,
McCarthy, and Johnson in the Harris
poll published last week). It is expres-
sive of the Republican opportunity.
Although Nixon himself is probably
not the Republicans’ best vote-getter,
and although his own choice of
Governor Agnew as his running-mate
has not strengthened the ticket among
northern liberals, the Democratic con-
vention has served to reinforce the
Nixon campaign strategy more power-
fully than the Republican planners can
have prayed for.
After the Republicans’ performance
at Miami Beach it was conceivable that


Spectators and National Guardsmen

Convention headquarters
the Democrats might have stood firm,
if not exactly united, against many of
the accumulated discontents of the past
eight years under Kennedy and
Johnson. Instead they have behaved as
Democrats do when they sense defeat,
by breaking all ways without even
being clear who the chief rebel leader
ought to be. The contemptuous detach-
ment of Senator McCarthy in the face
of so much politicking has been a
further source of mere factiousness. On
the very problem of the cities, with
which so many Democratic votes are
bound up, the Democrats are loud in
condemnation of what they suppose
Nixon and Agnew would do, but present
no clear strategy of their own to those
who want to hear one.
Against this Democratic disarray
Nixon is increasingly recognised as
standing for law and order, and when
that cannot be achieved, then for order
and law. Nixon means to carry the
suburbs and small towns of the north
and west this way; he knows those small
towns from 1960, when they nearly won
him the day against John Kennedy.
The same policy should help him in
the border States, and, with a suitable
presentation by Senator Strom Thur-
mond and others, could snatch some
southern votes from George Wallace’s
hands. Nixon is counting on an Ameri-
can mood, on a turn back toward con-
servative normalcy. He could be wrong.
But it is now legitimate for him to
believe that, barring some enormous
blunder, he cannot be stopped now.
The Russians almost committed that
blunder for Nixon, as for themselves,
when they invaded Czechoslovakia on
August 21. It might have been the
shock that is needed to remind the
American electorate that the United
States still carries great, and possibly in-
creasing, responsibilities in the world,
that there are more patently liberal
causes than the Vietnam War to be up-
held, that even the defence of South
Vietnam is as important as President
Johnson has always said it is. It may
be that something of this has seeped
into the American consciousness. But
if it has it is almost more likely to
help Nixon than Humphrey, for Nixon
is the candidate who can claim not only
to want to wind up the Vietnam War,
with no fellow Republicans grumbling
that he doesn’t know how, but to be
the man who always talked toughest to
Communists as well.
There are dangers in this sort of
straddle, but none of them are elec-
toral ones. It is the question of what
Nixon would do once he were in the
White House that matters, and matters
all the more after the Democratic con-
vention. When he spoke at Miami
Beach he gave an America-first over-
tone to his policies, and talked of re-
assessing American commitments around
ij t. , . x ,
k [ t u ? aS U n bei "« P ut about
on his behalf that he was thinking twice
about continuing conscription and
might prefer a smaller, professional
army. Nixon is an experienced opera-
tor. He would do nothing rash. He
would not wind up the Vietnam War
overnight. The question is rather
whether he would initiate positive
action of any kind himself. What he
might do would be things that were
weak because he thought they would
be popular.
These are still only fears. Richard
Nixon has not won yet. He has not
shown himself yet to be a president of
modest vision. It is very possible that,
if he were elected, he would go along
™ itb courses that any American
leader has to follow by reason of
America s place in the world. He may
well be the klnd of man who S rows
even more in the offlce than other men
do - The na S§ in g wori T remains that his
victory would be likely to be one for
£ e . politics of discouragement in the
Y mted States as well as in Vietnam,
tbat ! he mood he f “ f cou ?tmg on in
America is one of defensiveness and,
very conceivably, parochialism,
Hubert Humphrey’s roots go down
into another stratum of American life
and experience. That is why the dam-
age that appears to have been done to
his cause in Chicago this week could
be so serious for very many people
outside the Democratic Party.
CANDIDATES
AND
CRISES
Mr. Nixon
Mr. Humphrey
THE VIETNAM CRISIS. There seems
no reason to believe that the election
of one candidate rather than another
will necessarily make any difference to
the Vietnam War—unless one of them
has a greater political skill at home in
securing support for his policies. In
theory, Mr. Nixon could be more sue-
cessful in “selling” an American defeat
in Vietnam because of his appeal to
Right-wingers.
THE RUSSIAN CRISIS. Again it
seems unlikely that one candidate would
have very different reactions from the
other in attitudes and policies toward
Russia’s resumption of the cold war.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY
CRISIS. Americans do not even yet
fully realise that the “dollar crisis” is
even more important than the “sterling
crisis,” and that both are part of a
general crisis in financing world trade
that will finally demand dramatic
changes. Both candidates seem to share
this lack of priority.
INTERNATIONAL AID CRISIS.
Either candidate is likely to take a more
liberal view than Congress, so that the
effect of his policies will depend on the
degree of his control over Congress,
URBAN CRISIS. Humphrey is more
likely to urge betterment schemes,
Nixon to urge increased order,
/-^dtotc
NEGRO CRISIS. In terms of both
policy and rhetoric, Humphrey, on
present performance, would seem the
better candidate.
THE CRISIS IN STYLE. Since many
of America’s problems come from its
uniqueness as a new kind of techno-
cratic society, how a President goes
about his work can be as important as
what he does. In this neither candidate
is promising, but Nixon may have the
advantage since his Party is not as tired
as tbe Democrats,
THE CRISIS IN RHETORIC. To
provide a credible conceptual frame-
WO rk for action may be the next Presi-
dent’s supreme problem. Here
Humphrey suffers the disadvantage of
being irretrievably old-hat. Nixon has
not yet shown his hand. His oppor-
tunism could conceivably lead him into
a better 'p os m° n than Humphrey’s.


The Russian leadership reveals
its mediocrity
By EDWARD CRANKSHAW
THE HIGHER LEADERSHIP of the
Soviet Union has closed its ranks for
the kill. The secret police have been
turned loose among the Czechoslovaks
in the wake of Soviet tanks, as the
Gestapo was once turned loose in the
wake of German tanks. With Mr.
Dubcek by all accounts a broken man,
with the Russians, like Hitler before
them, preparing to divide Czech from
Slovak, while, at the same time, making
threats against the Romanians and the
Yugoslavs—with all this nothing would
appear to be more irrelevant than con-
tinued speculation about the strains and
stresses inside the Soviet Union.
But it is not irrelevant, because the
whole hideous situation, the return to
darkness at noon, is the direct outcome
of those strains and stresses as they have
been building up in general since the
death of Stalin and in particular under
the ignorant, mediocre, and indecisive
leadership which took over from
Khrushchev.
Khrushchev, for all his shortcomings,
made things happen. For just on four
years the present leadership has made
nothing happen at all. It has been
dragged along by circumstances. (The
most spectacular example was the way
they allowed the Arabs to involve them
in the six-day war, resulting in damage
to their prestige.)
The rape of Czechoslovakia was the
first decisive action of a group of men
who have shown themselves unfit to
govern. That they are not the only
present-day government unfit to govern
is neither here nor there. So far, for
example, the peoples of Britain and
America have shown themselves able to
survive and hold together without
strong government. It is very different
in the Soviet Union.
The senior leaders in Moscow are all
in this together. Obviously there have
been sharp differences among them
over what to do about the Czechs, dif-
ferences going back at least six months.
But now they have acted as a body,
and they must be judged as a body
until one or more of them gets up and
publicly denounces the others and more
totally than Khrushchev ever allowed
himself to denounce Stalin.
Some, we know, are in many ways
a cut above the others. Podgorny, for
example, who has frequently shown
an awareness that we are living in the
twentieth century, not in the seven-
teenth; Polyansky, the brightest speci-
men of a younger generation of Party
bosses; perhaps, in his morosely grop-
ing way, Kosygin himself. But they have
all put their seal to this act. They
have all connived at the bullying of
Mr. Dubcek. They all remain colleagues
of Shelest, who, taking time off from
terrorising the Ukraine, was most vocal
in his threats to smash the Czechs. And
they all continue to sit at the same
aii *i p j a j i
table with Comrade Andropov, whose
secret police, once again happy in their
wor , are preparing or a field day.
It is a Russian decision. There is no

y U ncht. These stories seem to
originate from Moscow itself.
T , . , . ,
There is another story going round
at Brezhnev agreed reluctantly to
commissioning this crime and was
pushed into it if not by Ulbncht, then
by his own Marshal Grechko. In the
sense that Brezhnev views with reluc-
tance the necessity of taking any
decision of any kind not directly con-
nected with the advancement of his
position and the retention of his power,
this is no doubt true: he is the brain-
less wonder of our age. You have to
look to Alabama or California to find
his equal. But he is the chosen figure-
anf as ‘such"""'?'' 1 t Par ' y appara ' US
and, as such, is very strong.

Do people realise what they are
saying when they suggest that he was
pushed into this action by a soldier?
It would mean nothing less than a
major revolution in the Soviet power
machine. It would mean the abdication
of the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R.
Whether Marshal Grechko was a
prime mover in this crime we do not
know. As a chief military adviser he has
to be listened to, and as a member
of the Central Committee he has some

sort of a voice in the Party apparatus.
But neither Stalin nor Khrushchev (nor
Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, and
all) would for one moment have
allowed any soldier, however dis-
tinguished, to have influenced their
decisions. This would have been tanta-
mount to inviting the military to take
over.
Until we see the Marshal taking
over in fact we had better assume that
the decision-makers are the men who
say they are, the same men who, in
person, not even by proxy, bullied and
maltreated Mr. Dubcek and his friends
before turning them loose whether
because, at that moment, they were
afraid to murder them and did not
know what else to do, or, more likely,
because they hoped they would per-
suade their people to keep quiet until
they could be neutralised without too
much public shooting.
So the question remains: why did
they do it? And the answer is always
the same: out of fear. It was fear
mainly of the consequences of the vic-
tory of the Czechoslovak cause to their
own positions inside the Soviet Union,
and, only in a lesser degree, of the
consequences in other satellites.
Even if, as I believed and still be-
lieve, some of them saw, and see, the
necessity of change inside the Soviet
Union and think they could preside
over it, they have for the time being,
perhaps for ever, lost their chance. We
have not heard much yet about open
criticism of the Kremlin’s action inside
Russia. We soon shall. It took some
weeks for the Moscow students to
demonstrate against the Hungarian
action in 1956, and then they were
put down quickly and sharply by
Khrushchev in person.
Two things have happened in the
intervening 12 years. On the broad
time-scale, the younger generation,
aided and abetted by quite a number
of the more cautious middle-aged,
have grown used to expressing dissent
on specific issues. There are whole
generations which never experienced
the Stalin terror and, therefore, cannot
imagine what it did to their fathers
and grandfathers, those who survived.
On the shorter time-scale, during the
past three years, the security police
have been allowed to flex their muscles,
flabby from comparative disuse, and to
brush up their old techniques, which
had grown a little rusty.
Since the last big round of public
protest after the trial and sentencing
of Ginsburg and his friends, the dis-
senters have kept very quiet, avoiding
head-on collision, but perfecting subtler
tactics, perhaps even a strategy of the
kind which has prevented the secret
police, the KGB, from making a quick
and final end of a number of distin-
guished protesters who in an earlier
age would have been thrown down the
cellar steps and shot before the out-
side world knew of their existence.

this. They also know that not only
the Moscow intelligentsia but, more
dangerously, their many minority
nationalities ranged round the periphery
of the union have been forced, against
the will of many of them, to turn to
nationalism as the only solution.
Nationalism is not the most hopeful
aspect of human endeavor, but some-
times it is the only way of breaking a
tyranny.
Brezhnev and his friends are aware
of this. Shelest in the Ukraine, who has
been behaving for some time like one
of Stalin’s gauleiters, is personally up
against it.
We need look no further. The Rus-
sian leadership, as a body, has decided
that the only way to keep its position
is to sit firmly on all manifestations
of change, whether in the form of
nationalism or of mild questioning of
their own infallibility.
For the security of the Soviet Union
as a whole, they cling with some
desperation to the idea of a nuclear
understanding with America as between
the two main imperialist powers, neither
aspiring to world domination.
They will not lose that understand-
ing. They will lose everything else, but
not before they have ruined the Czechs.
They cannot reimpose Stalinism on
Czechoslovakia without trying to impose
it on Russia and here they will fail.
In spite of many appearances to the
contrary, the Soviet Union of today is
not the Soviet Union of Stalin and
cannot be run in the Stalin manner
without a check to economic develop-
ment which would lead to breakdown
or explosion. It is to be doubted
whether Brezhnev has the brains to
appreciate this, but some of his col-
leagues have. They must be more
frightened today than they were when
they took their panic decision. The
dinosaur is stuck in the swamp and
dying. This is small comfort for the
Czechs who are flattened beneath the
monster’s bulk.
AUSTRIA
CZECH REFUGE
VIENNA TODAY is beginning to
resemble the “refugee” city of 1956,
when Hungarians arrived there in
thousands. Some 5000 Czechs have
already arrived in the Austrian capital
from Yugoslavia, where they were on
holiday, and last Friday an Austrian
border official estimated that another
5000 had crossed into Austria from
Bratislava and Prague.
Of those who have come from Yugo-
slavia, few wish to go home. One
schoolteacher from Bratislava, his wife,
and three children packed into their
car with their camping equipment
the only mementoes of home they retain
said: “It has been an agonising
choice, whether to go back and face
the Russians or seek the freedom of the
West. We were lucky. We have our
family with us. Others, with wives and
Austrians peering into Czechoslovakia at the Vienna-Bratislava checkpoint
children in Czechoslovakia, are half out
of their minds with worry. For them
if they go back at least they will be
united again.”
Refugee camps are being prepared in
various parts of the city to cope with
the expected influx of Czechs. First
estimates that about 20,000 people
might seek the protection of the West
are now being revised. One Austrian
Government estimate puts the possible
final figure as high as 50,000 but
this depends on how long the border
crossings stay open.
The differences between the escapers
of today and their counterparts of 12
years ago are quite marked. A Vienna
police official with memories of the
1956 crisis said: “Then the Hungarians
came on foot or by horse and cart flee-
ing almost at the point of the Russian
tanks. Today those who are coming
across are in the main young middle-
class people. Many of them have their
cars. The trains are still running and
these are packed, but again the people
appear to have had time to collect their
most valued belongings.”
Planes into Vienna from Western
capitals at the weekend were also
carrying large numbers of Czechs who
had been abroad on business or pleasure
when the Russians invaded their
country. A British European Airways
flight from London arriving at Vienna
on Friday carried 20 Czechs out of the
30 passengers.
One of them was an electronics
engineer from Brno, who said that he
and his wife were going to the border
to try to get their two children, aged
18 and 13, out of Czechoslovakia to
safety.
He said: “Please do not mention my
name. It could make things terribly
dangerous for my wife. She is going to
try to get into Czechoslovakia by car
to fetch the children while I wait here.
They telephoned me in London from
Brno and told me that they were well
but afraid that events might overtake
them in the next few days.”
Austrians are worried by the course
of events in Central Europe, but they
do not believe that they are next on
the Russian list. The small Austrian
Army is in good condition and there
are trained reserves. The Austrian Gov-
ernment has decided not to order
mobilisation, but troops were alerted
after the Czech invasion and “gar-
risoned” in towns and villages about 20
or 30 miles south of the northern
frontier with Czechoslovakia.
ROMANIA AND YUGOSLAVIA
WHOSE TURN NEXT?
IN THEIR TIME of trouble the
Czechs and Slovaks have certainly not
lacked for sympathy and moral support.
But in most cases the support has
cost the giver little or nothing. The
Yugoslav and Romanian leaders, on
the other hand, had every excuse to
think twice before committing them-
selves to open support of the Czechs.
They could not be sure that the men
in the Kremlin, having once taken the
decision to send their tanks into
Czechosolvakia, would not go on to
discover counter-revolutionary plots in
Romania and Yugoslavia and feel
obliged to stamp on them, too.
On the other hand, both President
Tito and President Ceausescu may well
have felt that a swift and categorical
condemnation of the Russian invasion
was the best way open to them of
warding off a potential Russian threat
to their own countries. Mr. Ceausescu
must have been speaking as much for
Tito of Yugoslavia and Romanian
Party leader Ceausescu after talks on
August 24


himself as for Mr. Dubcek when he
told the Romanian National Assembly
on August 22 that relations between
Parties and States must “proceed ex-
clusively between their lawful leader-
ships and not between groups or per-
sons who do not represent anybody.”
Both Mr. Ceausescu and President
Tito have emphasised their firm belief
that socialism was not being under-
mined or in any way endangered in
Czechoslovakia. President Tito, who
must be much more genuinely sympa-
thetic than Mr. Ceausescu to the
Czechs’ attempt to fit a progressive,
liberal system into a single Party
regime, told his central committee that
the Czechoslovak leaders had been de-
termined not to allow any revival of
a multi-party system. For Mr.
Ceausescu, who has accepted only the
barest minimum of liberalisation in his
own country, the crux of the matter
was expressed in one sentence in the
long declaration issued by the
Romanian National Assembly on
August 22: “For no reason, in no case,
and in no form can the Warsaw Treaty
organisation be used or invoked for
military sanctions against a socialist
country.”
In both countries, reactions to the
Czechoslovak crisis were by no means
confined to words. President Tito and
Mr. Ceausescu met near the Yugoslav-
Romanian border on August 24 to
discuss the situation. In Yugoslavia,
Army leave was cancelled and some
reserves called up. So far as is known,
reservists were not called up in
Romania; but the border defences were
strengthened and Mr. Ceausescu’s
announcement that a voluntary national
guard would be formed is said to have
met with an enthusiastic response. In
both countries there were big popular
demonstrations. In Belgrade, emotions
were heightened by the recollection of
where the Yugoslavs stood 20 years ago.
In Bucharest, the annual Liberation
Day parade on August 23 became a
pro-Czech demonstration. The Czech
ministers, Dr. Ota Sik and the Minister
of Planning, Mr. Vlasek, who were on
holiday in Yugoslavia when the
Russians invaded their country, made
Belgrade their headquarters, but flew
off to Bucharest on August 25 for a
brief consultation with their Romanian
friends.
All this was badly received by the
Russians and their allies, who retaliated
by unleashing a sharp Press campaign
against Romania and Yugoslavia.
Neither the Romanians nor the Yugo-
slavs are likely to be intimidated by
Press campaigns alone. But the Roma-
nians at any rate may have been given
some more solid reason to exercise
discretion. On August 25, the Russian
Ambassador to Bucharest asked for an
immediate interview with Mr.
Ceausescu. It is not known what was
said on that occasion. But afterwards
Mr. Ceausescu’s speeches became
noticeably less uncompromisingly hostile
to the Russian point of view. So did
the Romanian Press, which virtually
stopped publishing reports on the course
of events in Prague. But last Wednes-
day a Romanian spokesman felt un-
able to deny categorically rumors that
Russia had asked permission to send
troops into Romania for joint
manoeuvres. This may account for the
Romanian Communist Party’s tough
statement on Thursday that Russian
troops should leave Czechoslovakia as
quickly as possible.

five invaders, are known to have sup-
ported the invasion of Czechoslovakia.
But even within what must now again
be called the Soviet bloc, public dis-
approval has come to the surface.
In East Germany young demon-
Tanzanians
took to the
streets in
Dar-Es-
Salaam to
show their
feelings about
the Russians
strators have risked and, in some cases,
suffered arrest —likely on past form to
be followed by years rather than weeks
of imprisonment—to protest on behalf
of the Czechs. Though police have
checked on callers at the Czech Embassy
in East Berlin and started recording
the numbers of visitors’ cars, the
Embassy has had thousands of signa-
tures of support. On the night of
August 24 a number of young people
gathered in the Karl Marx Allee chant-
ing “Dubeck” before vanishing rapidly
to escape the police. Others were
arrested in East Berlin while distribut-
ing pamphlets criticising the aggression.
In Poland last week broadsheets
were scattered assuring the Czechs that
they were not alone: “The forces that
have violently suppressed the rebirth
in Czechoslovakia are the same as those
that suppressed the students in Poland
last March and that annulled the results
of the liberalisation in Poland in 1956.”
At the official level, a number of
supporters of the Polish Communist
Party leader, Wladislaw Gomulka, have
expressed their dismay in private. The
French Government told Gomulka an
official visit due shortly would no
longer be welcome. The Polish
“Partisan” faction the Communists
who served in the underground during
the war and have remained a power-
ful political force ever since headed
by General Mieczyslaw Moczar, is
sniping at Gomulka with arguments
that appear as paradoxical as they are
in fact consistent.
The Polish “Partisans,” the strongest
upholders of national independence, are
also the strongest public supporters of
the intervention; but it is also they,
through “Trybuna Ludu,” who have
been the first to mention “the bitter-
ness, even shock” of the Czechs. The
line of argument of the “Partisans,”
who are known to be strongly anti-
semitic, that the intervention was an
unhappy affair brought upon the
Czechs by the weakness of their own
leaders in the face of “revisionist and
zionist” forces. Under a tough leader-
ship Czechoslovakia would never have
suffered foreign intervention, since there
would have been no need for it.
In Russia itself, Pavel Litvinov, grand-
son of the former Foreign Minister,
and Larissa Daniel, wife of the writer
sentenced in 1966 for publishing his
work abroad, tried to protest in Red
Square, after writing to various foreign
Communist papers that not all Russians
supported the aggression committed in
their name. They and four others were
arrested. All but one have been charged
with “disturbing public order.”
JAPAN-U.S.
WHICH WAY NOW?
AMERICAN and Japanese officials in
Tokyo believe the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia has given the Japanese
a sense of threat, that it will check
the drift toward a position of neutrality
between East and West and the
Japanese tendency to criticise their U.S.
defence arrangements.
A Japanese defence expert spoke out
this way last week: “We didn’t think
the Chinese posed any immediate threat
as long as American missiles in Montana
were pointed that way. As for the
Russians, well everyone could see they
had changed and were becoming decent,


peace-loving fellows. It took Czecho-
slovakia to open our eyes.”
Since World War 11, Japan, limited
by the U.S.-imposed constitution to
modest police and self-defence forces,
has concentrated on trade, commerce,
and industry, leaving security problems
to the U.S. Japan once again is one of
the world’s powerful industrial nations,
and most Japanese like it this way.
Most, not all.
There is significant and militant
opinion which questions whether Japan
can afford the risks seen as the price
of continued protection, that America’s
military presence might attract attack,
and bring Japan into a war it does not
want. Then, too, there is the affront
to national pride in the vestiges of
occupation.
The militant nationalistic student
organisation, Zengakuren, is planning
a series of demonstrations, starting in
October and continuing until 1970
when the mutual security treaty with
the U.S. reaches its tenth anniversary.
Issues underlying the problems of
future Japan-U.S. relations include the
extent of Japan’s leadership role in the
Far East and how much bigger her
military forces need be. Also the
emotionally explosive one: should
Japan, the only country that has
suffered from nuclear attack, develop
nuclear weapons.
Japan’s present defence strength is:
Army, 13 divisions, with 157,000 men;
Air Force, less than 40,000; Navy, less
than 36,000. Defence expenditure is
only about one percent of the gross
national product ($91.1 billion).
The Czechoslovakia invasion has
reminded the Japanese neutralists of
something they would have preferred
to go on regarding as none of their
business: the menacing proximity of
nuclear and conventional forces in
Soviet Asia.
CRICKET v. APARTHEID
MCC FAILED ITS TEST
IN TRYING to be “non-political” the
MCC selectors have in fact made a
sad political blunder. Their decision to
leave out Basil d’Oliveira from the
side to tour South Africa makes no
sense at all in cricketing terms, and
the reasons given to defend it can
hardly be taken seriously.
In wider terms and cricket, like
any human activity, can never ’-•* con-
sidered in a political vacuum, as
though it were played and watched by
a species of robots a golden oppor-
tunity has been missed. In a flexible
situation the wrong gamble was taken.
The arguable case against d’Oliveira
is that he had a disappointing tour
in quite different conditions as a
bowler in the West Indies and a
comparatively lean English County
season; also that, at 33, he-is getting
on in years. The case for d’Oliveira
is that his temperament makes him as
effective a Test batsman as England
D’Oliveira hitting out in the fifth
Test. The MCC hasn’t gone to bat for
him
has his record in this respect is
unrivalled; that as a bowler he was
brought up on South African wickets,
which have recently become exactly
suited to his style; and that his presence
as the only all-rounder would materially
improve the balance of the side.
A year or two ago the MCC
announced, under pressure of public
opinion, that no compromises would be
acceptable in the choice of players to
tour South Africa or in the treatment
they received when they got there.
Even so, it was plain that d’Oliveira’s
potential presence would create all
kinds of anomalies and possible em-
barrassments, as well as a general
sharpening of political tension. Those
who put a quiet life and the main-
tenance of the status quo before all
else and the MCC has all the
instincts of outer suburbia when it
comes to avoiding “trouble” hoped
it would never happen.
It is impossible to allow that non-
cricketing considerations of any kind
played no part in d’Oliveira’s rejection.
D’Oliveira, as both batsman and bowler,
was crucial in winning the historic fifth
Test match. The conditions for the
greater part of it were similar to those
that may be found in South Africa. It
is inconceivable in the light of this that
he could not find a place among the
16 players chosen for the tour had all
else been equal.
The rejection of d’Oliveira, whatever
the ostensible reasons, will now come as
a soothing breeze to the sweating but
complacent apostles and fellow-
travellers of apartheid—it was received
with cheers in Afrikaner circles —and as
an unexpected blow in the face to those
of d’Oliveira’s color. Any sophisticated
committee with a healthy sense of
priorities—with so little in it and the
issues so delicately balanced would
have made absolutely sure that, if
humanly possible, this should not
happen.
There are issues in the world in
which even a wooden rifle is better than
no rifle at all.
D’Oliveira, unpolitical, inscrutable,
and unassuming as he is, might have
been more use than either.
NEW ZEALAND
WORKING TO PLAN
ALL GROUPS at last week’s National
Development Planning Conference in
New Zealand seemed to accept that the
economy could, and should, be planned,
but they are a long way from working
out how this can be done.
The New Zealand Government seems
also to have woken up to the political
implications of their new economic
tool. The Prime Minister, Mr. Holyoake,
said that “the final program will not
be something forced on people by
Government action—it will emerge as
the result of a genuine co-operative
effort, a perfect example of the indica-
tive planning which the Government
believes in” and “the Government will
put its full weight behind all practicable
measures to choose priorities because
our resources will not permit expansion
in all fields.”
However, it was clear from the con-
ference that New Zealand’s economy
will still be very dependent on a narrow
range of agricultural products for a
long time to come. Although every
group uttered pro-planning incantations*
each seemed well aware of its sectional
stake.
Farmers supported their allotted
target, but seemed a little hesitant about
the prospects of meeting it. There were
references to the 1963 Agricultural
Development Conference, which in-
duced some farmers to overproduce-
when markets contracted. A manufac-
turer’s spokesman said industry could
meet its target but was called on to
answer criticism that secondary in-
dustry wanted too much protection.
A tourism spokesman declared that
his industry could lay eggs more golden
than the target committee had asked
for. Forestry also said it could exceed
its target. Only fisheries asked for
time and research to enable them to
do as well as expected. However, a lot
of the optimism about out-targeting
the target-setters may have been subtle
bargaining for more Government
capital investment.
The unions have in general been co-
operative, at least in speeches at the
conference. But the suggestion that the
National Development Conference was
a gigantic sham which would increase
unemployment was aired in the Press
after the conference.
Finally, the conference passed
motions accepting the targets for
various industries as flexible goals, and
went away for committee work until
next May and with a direction to con-
sider how to build a permanent plan-
ning structure.


THE WEEK IN AMERICA
Mayor Daley...sensitive about Chicago
THE ENFORCERS
EARLY one morning in Chicago last
week, as burly blue-helmeted cops pat-
rolled the footpath outside the Conrad
Hilton Hotel guarding the Democratic
National Convention, one of them stop-
ped a slim, 27-year-old Pressman and
demanded his identification tag. This
was produced, and the cop asked the
journalist’s name. “Winston Churchill,”
was the reply. “Hey, Sarge,” the cop
yelled to his superior, “here’s a guy
claims he’s Winston Churchill. What’ll
we do with him?” The sergeant
motioned to a police van alongside the
hotel, and the cop began marching the
journalist toward it.
When the newsman produced a key
to a room in the hotel, the cop reluc-
tantly marched him to the desk, where
a clerk verified the journalist to be the
grandson of the late Prime Minister,
who was covering the convention for
the London “Evening News.” Churchill,
who has been a war correspondent in
Vietnam, Israel, and elsewhere, wrote,
“I never felt the necessity of wearing
a steel helmet anywhere but in
Chicago.”
Churchill was but one of dozens of
journalists harassed, clubbed, and beaten
by the 11,000-man police force during
the hippie disturbances in Chicago
streets. Some Pressmen required hos-
pital treatment. Photographers were
favorite targets for the clubs and pistol
butts of the police, who sometimes
removed their identifying name-tags
when “working over” journalists wear-
ing identifying Press badges issued by
the police department.
Police resentment against the Press
arose from a feeling shared by their
boss, Mayor Richard Daley, that TV
Churchill...“what'll we do with him?”
and newspaper reporters were “trying
to make Chicago look bad” by playing
up the violence in the streets, and police
activity. A Chicago newspaper colum-
nist, Mike Royko, said: “The biggest
threat to law and order at the conven-
tion has been the Chicago Police
Department.” Actually, the militant
invaders probably never exceeded 5000
in number.
VOTING DROP-OUTS
DESPITE the ferocity of the Presi-
dential election campaign, one out of
every four eligible U.S. voters has failed
so far to register to vote in November.
Of an electorate totalling 115.7 million,
by last week 29 million had still not
fulfilled the prerequisite. The worst
laggards are youths and Negroes. Half
of those between 21 and 29 are un-
registered, while nearly four in ten
Negroes have not signed. Registration
of women is up, however, and more
women will be voting in November,
overall, than men. New registrations
before election day are expected to
alter the picture only slightly.
THE VIOLENT YEAR
WITH “law and order” emerging as a
major issue in the coming elections,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation re-
ported last week that the number of
serious crimes, both violent and non-
violent, increased by 16 percent in 1967
over 1966. The year’s average increase
was led by a 28 percent jump in rob-
beries, which includes muggings, stick-
ups, bank robberies, and thefts involving
a threat of bodily harm.
In past years, some criminologists
have looked askance at the FBI figures
in the belief that measured increases
from year to year reflected only better
reporting methods and not actual
crimes. But one of the critics, Professor
Lloyd E. Ohlin, of Harvard Law School,
said the new statistics “shook me up a
bit.” He said that some part of the
increase “must reflect a change in the
readiness of people to resort to armed
attack against strangers.”
Another critic, Professor Marvin E.
Wolfgang, of the University of Penn-
sylvania, agreed that the statistics were
accurate, although some part of the
statistical rise might reflect greater
police zeal in reporting crimes. He
blamed much of it on the rising pro-
portion of young people in the popu-
lation. The young, he said, were the
most inclined to commit crime
Another troubling statistic was the
arrest figures for Negroes. Though
Negroes make up only 13 percent of
the population, 'more Negroes than
whites were arrested in 1967 for murder,
aggravated assault, carrying concealed
weapons, prostitution, and gambling.
The Negro crime rate as a whole is
about four times that of whites, with
the murder rate about eight times that
of the U.S. as a whole.
Apologists for the Negroes object,
however, that when crime figures for
Negroes and whites living under the
same economic circumstances are
compared, the Negro figures are only
slightly higher.
The FBI has been keeping national
crime figures since 1960. A co'mparison
of arrest figures between 1960 and last
year shows that narcotics arrests rose
by 164 percent, most of them for mari-
huana use. Here, the increase was
mostly among white persons.
When the crime rate is broken down
geographically, New York City is
shown to have twice the national
average, with the State of California
running a close second. Just for the
first six months of this year, murder
arrests in New York City rose by 40
percent compared with the same
period of 1967. Arrests for possession
of dangerous weapons, such as guns,
knives, and blackjacks, 'more than
doubled. But only one percent of all
arrests in New York were made during
public demonstrations, such as the
Columbia University sit-in in April
and the various Vietnam peace parades.
Meanwhile, a noted American
psychologist blamed the new violence
in American life on unnecessary sexual
restrictions. Dr. Albert Ellis said that
frustrations arising from sexual prob-
lems often led to anger and rage, which
in turn led to violent acts. In research
on a book he is writing on the psychol-
ogy of murderers and assassins, Dr.
Ellis said he had found that “in every
case the person has felt inadequate
about himself. They are enraged within
because they are intolerant of their own
deficiencies,” he said. “And rather than
change the'mselves they attempt to
remove obstacles in their way.”
THUNDERING SCANDAL
AMERICA’S largest firm of stock-
brokers was accused of fraud by the
Securities and Exchange Commission
last week. The agency, moving against
Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner, and
Smith Incorporated, named 14 of the
firm’s officers and salesmen and said
they had leaked confidential infoTma-
tion to 14 favored institutional clients
in 1966. As a result, the SEC charged,
the clients had profited by a total
$4,500,000. A SEC regulation holds
that those who are privy to information
that is withheld from the general
public may not benefit by trading on
it.
In 1966 the firm (known by its
sobriquet, “The Thundering Herd,”
because of its multiple partners)
learned that Douglas Aircraft Com-
pany would shortly reveal its declining
earnings. By passing along this “non-
public” information to the favored
clients, they were able to sell 190,000
shares of Douglas short, profiting to
the extent of the drop in price —
from $90.50 per share on June 22, 1966,
to $64.37 a week later. The tip was
restricted to the 14 clients and not
distributed to the firm’s 1,100,000
ordinary customers.


The Asian Chicago?

in the Philippines is a legacy
of American colonisation: in
neither country is law and
order top priority
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
AS PRESIDENT MARCOS said a
little over a year ago, the Philippines is
“a country with some 33 million people
(now' nearer 35) and with one of the
highest birth rates in the w'orld, where
only 1.1 percent of the population
enjoys an income of 20,000 pesos or
more a year while close to 70 per-
cent of the population has to survive
on an income of 400 pesos a year or
less.” "Such a country,” continued its
President, “is literally living on top of a
social volcano that can erupt any day
with, or even without, the benefit of
Communist prodding. Such a country
has no time to lose but must mobilise
without delay all the resources of the
community to attack the social problem
at its source.”
This stark description can be well
applied with slight variations to most of
South-East Asia. The extremes of
w'ealth vary, but everywhere there are
extremes, usually sufficient to surprise
the visitor from the more egalitarian
West, and to make him wonder whether
the internal marshalling of domestic
resources w'ould not be sufficient to
supplant foreign aid or even foreign
investment. In the Philippines the
extremes are easier to see than anyw'here
else, mainly due to the very conspicu-
ous consumption of the few', the general
lack of inhibition about flaunting
w'ealth. There is the strange sight of
swank Manila suburbs containing homes
as luxurious as you can find anywhere,
guarded by their own privately hired
"police” forces. There is the more usual
sight of miles and miles of squatters’
huts unrelieved by any sight of any
determined Government effort to pro-
vide low'-cost housing.
But it is the need for private police
forces, rather than the rich homes they
guard, w'hich indicates the more import-
ant aspect of the Filipino social volcano.
Great wealth in the Philippines, accord-
ing to many competent observers, does
not arouse the bitter resentments that
it has done, and will do, elsewhere.
Since most of these observers are
themselves w'ealthy, their judgment
may, of course, be an example of the
rich man in his castle deliberately mis-
understanding the poor man at his
gate; nonetheless, there would appear
to be some justification for their argu-
ment. There is vertical mobility in
Filipino society. The elite of wealth is
not a closed shop. The traditionally
wealthy class, tbe illustrados, may
socially resent the nouveau riche, but
still they do arise. Either through poli-
tics or through smuggling or through
other businesses (both legitimate and
shady) there is opportunity for the
humblest to make the grade. As far
as one can see, there is no particular
value placed upon how one makes it,
as long as one does. Since the ordinary
Filipino admires wealth, and feels the
attaining of it is not beyond his or his
son’s reach, does the social volcano
thereby have a safety valve w'hich will
prevent it from ultimately exploding?
Time alone will answer the question.
All that can be safely asserted is that
it would be wrong to assume that w'hat
is obnoxious to foreigners is likewise
objectionable to Filipinos.
The more important point w'ould
seem to be that the w’hole of Filipino
life is encompassed w'ithin a general
framework of insecurity, the most im-
portant aspect of w'hich is the “peace
and order situation” or, to put it
another w r ay, the lack of either peace
or order.
“WHO’S NEXT?” asked a “Philip-
pines Herald” headline soon after I
arrived in Manila in July. The
headline referred to the July 7-13
period, described as the “most horrify-
ing seven days of violence” since tbe
“start of the multi-pronged anti-crime
campaign.” Certainly it had been quite
a w'eek. “First, a jail warden was slain.
Then a vice-governor and a pilot cap-
tain. Next, a judge. And then a movie
actor.” Tbe latter had been cut down
in a nightclub and, by the time I left,
his was the only one of these killings
for which culprits had been arraigned.
But these w'ere the notables. In the
same w'eek the “Herald” reported there
had been 38 other killings—“Cagayan,
Pampanga, and Manila contributed four
deatbs each to top the list of hotspots
for the week; follow'ed by Pangasinan
and Batangas with three each; Mt.
Province, Quezon City, Western Samar,
Tarlac, Rizal, and Palawan with two
each; and Northern Samar, Nueva
Ecija, Cebu, Agusan, Cotabato, Lanao
del Norte, Romblon, La Union, Caga-
yande Oro City, Sulu, Camarines, and
Laguna with one each.” In short, while
there were some provinces where there
were either no murder or no murders
' recorded, the spread of murder is by no
means limited to a feu urban centres.
The mere listing of murders is, of
course, but a symptom of the malaise,
not the malaise itself. Once again one
has to be careful. The sensationalism
and the prolixity of the Manila Press
inevitably distort the real nature of the
“crisis” the fact that' the law is
imperfectly administered and that order
and social cohesion are imperfectly sus-
tained. It is a trifle unfair that the
Philippines has obtained for itself the
image of being the prize gangster city
of Asia. Order is imperfectly sustained
to a greater or lesser extent elsewhere.
But the Press in such countries is less
free to report, less willing or able to
sensationalise. Who knows to this day
how many killings accompanied the
attempted coup in Indonesia? What
would India’s image be like if the
amount of sudden or unnatural death
were to be equally played up by her
more conservative newspapers?
Put another way, lawlessness is by no
means total or complete. The situation
is still one which Filipinos can endure,
if unhappily. "We are going through
our Chicago period,” says one promi-
nent economist, and the parallel has
relevance, implying as it does a transi-
tional period to be ended rather than
absolute chaos attained. If you are
thinking of visiting the Philippines, don’t
let the crime reports put you off. Just
be careful. That’s all. During your trip
the only untoward thing you observe
will probably be the signs at some of
the restaurants and nightclubs
“Please check in your guns before enter-
ing.” Few do.
Perhaps one can best convey an
impression of the uncertainty with a
few random observations . . . The hotel
porters noting the number of the taxi
you drive off in, just in case . . . The
friend who urges you not to go for a
walk at night “in case you get mugged”
... The householder who refuses to
report a burglary to the local police
station because "they might be in
league with the criminals and we would
only have more burglaries” . . . The
large number of Filipinos who will
argue that the Communist links have
become one more protection racket in a
country which abounds with them . . .
Any meaningful discussion of the
peace-and-order situation inevitably


leads on to a which-comes-first argu-
ment. Which comes first: The lack of
effective law enforcement? Or the gen-
eral lack of effective administration? Or
the all-pervasive inefficiency and cor-
ruption? Whichever it is they would all
seem interrelated and prevalent factors
in Filipino instability.
For anyone used to the ways of
British-style parliamentary democracy,
the dual lack of orderliness and of a
single national administrative frame-
work is particularly striking. Instead of
the neat and systematic gradations of
authority (sometimes too inelastic)
which still characterise the Malaysian
and Singaporean administrative systems,
power in the Philippines seems alto-
gether too diffuse, thoroughly unsys-
tematic; to say that it is too elastic
conveys a picture of more authority
than the system appears to have.
Instead of a machine which theoreti-
cally continues whatever Government
comes to power, there is a loose and
variable conglomeration of Government
agencies and departments, often with
overlapping functions, which materially
changes every time a new President is
elected. “What we lack more than any-
thing else,” one leading banker said to
me, “is that continuity which the parlia-
mentary system provides.” He went on
to wonder if the possible re-election of
President Marcos for a further four-
year term might not gear up a machine
which would have greater momentum
by the time the next President was
elected. Until now, Presidents haven’t
been able to get re-elected, with the
result that agencies started by one
President are deliberately starved of
funds by his successor, as he sets about
creating his own.
On the one hand, one is left acutely
aware of an often-neglected aspect of
Anglo-American differences, the fact
that law-and-order is not the top
priority in the American pattern of
thinking that it is for the British-
oriented; that American-style democ-
racy makes its own rules while British
style tends to work within a set frame-
work. While for the ex-British colonies
the task has been to improve upon the
standards the British imposed, in the
Philippines, the Americans do not seem
to have imposed any administrative
standards. If they did, then, crucially,
the occupation of the Philippines bv
the Japanese shattered them, and they
had not been resurrected by the time
independence hurriedly arrived. In the
same way, the occupation in the Philip-
pines saw widespread guerilla activity.
Lawlessness became a value, and mani-
festations of it have c< 'tinued ever
since.
On the other hand, one is left won-
dering what would have happened if the
British had stayed and colonised the
Philippines when they briefly ousted the
Spaniards in the 18th century. Would
the parliamentary system have been any
better as a vehicle for administering a
far-flung archipelago? Interestingly, it is
nowadays possible to hear some thought-
ful Filipinos claiming that it would. As
one provincial Governor put it to a
friend of mine in an introspective
moment, “Maybe it would have been
better for us . . . just imagine, an
unelected District Commissioner would
now have been sitting in this chair . . .”
His observation is relevant only in so far
as once again in parliamentary
democratic eyes there would seem to
be just too many elections for too
many offices for too little result in the
Philippines.
Be that as it may, the creeping trend
toward anarchy and governmental
ineffectiveness is accentuated by the
prevalence of inefficiency and cor-
ruption. Again this would seem to come
back to the highly personal rather than
impersonal forms of Filipino democ-
racy and values. Ties of kinship or
friendship allied with unideological
politics make a devastating combina-
tion. Politics consists of obtaining power
and, having obtained it, of sharing its
benefits. Nepotism and corruption both
permeate and flourish at all levels and
in all fields. Equally (lest I impose
my own values, as so many Westerners
do when confronted with these
realities), it must be noted that they
are very largely expected and accepted
there is not as yet any discernible
puritan conscience on these matters,
though President Marcos did give ex-
pression to it as well as describing
implicitly what goes on not so long ago
when declaiming, “I will punish anyone
whom I find guilty no matter how
close he may be to me, whether he is
my relative or my leader or my ally.
If they are guilty of any venality my
duty is to punish that man and I will
perform my duty . . .” Inevitably,
examples have not been set nor would
the great majority expect it to be other-
wise. Interestingly, venality with one’s
relatives or cronies is only objected to
(as with earlier administrations) when
it becomes blatant or “excessive.” Cor-
ruption flourishes, if only because
everyone is convinced or accepts that
it is part of an unchangeable pattern.
Lawlessness, maladministration, cor-
ruption if these are the symptoms
of social disintegration then they are
also the cause and the effect of politics.
The question is not, of course, that these
things are “wrong” or “wicked” but
the reality of these factors rolling into
a vicious circle which inhibits the
growth of national consciousness (in a
constructive sense) multiplies the
a'mount of social injustice, restricts
economic development, and generally
keeps the Republic steadily plugging
along down the road to nowhere.
Crucially, no substantial break in the
vicious circle appears to be in sight,
though the future is not without hope.
But for the most part politics has ceased
to be and shows few signs of becoming
a means of responding to the country’s
vital needs. Filipino democracy has
frozen into being mainly, and merely,
a 'means for the rule of the nation by
an elite for the selfish interests of that
elite.
Not that there is any failure to see
the problems in this harsh light.
Nowhere else in South-East Asia is there
so much destructive and eloquent self-
analysis as in the Philippines. No-
where else in South-East Asia is the
desirability and inevitability of “revolu-
tion” so freely and frankly discussed
so much so that one comes to the
conclusion that all the talk of revolution
is but another safety valve, likely to so
devalue the concept as to prevent it
ever taking place.
What worries the more perceptive
Filipinos is the reverse of what worries
many of their allies. For the latter,
the fear is of a revolution becoming
the only answer to the vicious circle.
What worries many thoughtful
Filipinos is that the vicious circle will
just drag on into the future, unbroken
by the great changes which they feel
are desperately needed. It is argued,
for example, that because of vertical
social mobility those who in other
countries would become dedicated
revolutionaries of some persuasion or
another will instead satisfy themselves
by pursuing the roads to political
or financial power that are open to
them. A slightly different variation on
the same theme was presented by one
pungent “Manila Chronicle” columnist,
I. P. Soliongco, recently when he
reported the testimony of two judges,
before a Congressional inquiry, that
the cause of the current crime wave
could be traced to criminal policemen
and criminal politicians. “This testi-
mony,” wrote Soliongco, “belongs to
the category of an axiom the
truth of which is accepted without
proof . . . Congress cannot exactly
be the agency for effecting reforms
in the enforcement of law. It is com-
posed of men who, by definition and
inclination, are the living proofs
of the (judges’) stinging indictment
. . . How many politicians have
approached Government officials for
favors which lie outside the margin
of the law? How many Senators are
acting as businessmen or as representa-
tives of illicit business interests? And
how many Congressmen have ex-
erted pressure to save some favored
criminal from well-deserved punish-
ment? . . . Attempts of politicians to
bring about reforms have been heavily
publicised . . . Publicity has been
mistaken for actual deeds ... As
long as politics remains our most
profitable industry the worst elements
will be attracted to it and the few.
virtuous ones who choose it as a career
will be ineffectual against the pack . . .”
Words will seemingly be ineffectual
to prevent the social volcano bubbling
and rumbling, if not erupting. “The
true test of the vitality of any society
rs the capacity of that society to diag-
nose its own ailments and weaknesses,”
President Marcos has pointed out,
“and diagnosing . . . prescribe its own
medicine, and prescribing . . . take the
medicine no matter how unpalatable it
may be.”
As yet, the Philippines seems far re-
moved from meeting that test. Between
words and deeds, as between rich and
poor, the gap grows wider.


Ecumenism on
the North Shore
Young people of different
religions have no trouble
getting together in the
spring sunshine at last
week’s Church unity con-
ference at Wahroonga,
N.S.W.
By SANDRA HALL
IN THE CAUSE of Church unity,
Sydney’s guru of Christian radicalism,
Rev. Ted Noffs, entered strange new
country last week—a Christian Brothers’
College in affluent Wahroonga.
The student body of the college,
St. Leo’s, invited more than 100 stud-
ents from North Shore Catholic,
private and State schools, along with
university students and seminarians, to
join in a three-day Ecumenical Sym-
posium, and Mr. Noffs was among the
speakers.
(( Hl s topic, predictably enough, was
The Youth Revolt. As pastor of the
Wayside Chapel at Kings Cross, he has
become something of an authority on
the subject in the past few years, and
some months ago appeared in a memor-
able newspaper photograph sitting
astride a motor-cycle and wearing a
leather jacket and cap to publicise the
work the “bikeys” of his unorthodox
parish were doing to help old-age pen-
s *°" r ers ‘ .
Now, among the educated offspring
of families who can afford the carefully
preserved bushland aura of Sydney’s
upper North Shore, he was making an
entirely new scene - one situation in
uhich, foi once, youth seemed to be
loldmg up the conservative side.
He began m a low key by charting
briefly the stages of the youth move-
ments of recent years from the
beatniks of the ’fifties, with their
ties to Sartre, Camus, and Existential-
ism, to the mid-’sixties, Vietnam, and
the nature of the hippie protest against
society (“to cease being involved in its
life”) and the emergence of a new
yardstick for action: Is it humane?
Kings Cross, he maintained, had been
the largest beatnik community in the
world in 1964, and was still a catalystic
place ... a point of confluence.
He reminisced about “going down
into the pads of Woolloomooloo” and
of offering to buy two bottles of milk
for a beatnik group. “No, Ted,” one
beatnik said, answering with a line
Hollywood might have rejected but
which Ted Noffs now repeated, “we
live only one bottle of milk at a
time.
The anarchist movement was at
present “the most formidable youth
movement” in Sydney and our age
could be summed up in one phrase
“The Eclipse of Authority.”
At any time, Noffs has the look of
an earnest bumble-bee moving at high
speed, and it intensified as he reached
the main theme of his speech: “Most
adults in middle life now will be
redundant in a few years, because we
won’t be able to understand the con-
ceptualising going on, so our task is
to remain flexible and open to new
ideas.
Invoking the fashionable name
of Teilhard de Chardin, Noffs talked
G f “thinking of God in cybernetic
language” and of Man discovering
through his own relationship with
automata more about the way “God
created us.” “Theology will go into
technology and biology,” he said.
Noffs had already touched on
ecumenism (“God forbid it remains
news when a Catholic bishop and an
Anglican sit down in church together”)
when he unsuspectingly precipitated a
mini-ecumenical crisis of his own.
He was answering a question put to
him by a student, and, in the course
of the answer, said that the divinity of
Jesus was “an achieved divinity a
major spiritual breakthrough showing
the possibilities within each of us.
Nowhere in the Bible does it say that
Jesus was God . . .”
At this point the parish priest of
nearby Waitara, Father M. Baulman,
got f- 0 pi s “I’d prefer you not to
say that here,” he said. “Keep off
theology—you’re giving these children
the wrong idea. Keep to the youth
revolt,” adding he didn’t approve of
the introduction of biology into the
discussion, either. He then sat down to
so'me subdued hisses from the audience,
Noffs, in a display of his celebrated
cool, said he saw theology and the
youth revolt as inseparable, then asked
if Father Baulman was issuing a direc-
tive. On receiving an affirmative answer,
he agreed not to go on with the point
he was making—“the last thing I want
to do is to provoke conflict here in any
shape or form.”
For a time things were tense, but
Noffs dropped a few Wayside Chapel
anecdotes, and equanimity was restored
with the laughter,
It was Father Baulman’s second brush
with controversy in three days. He had
already prevented ABC-TV’s “This Day
Tonight” team from filming the sym-
posium’s opening, held at his church

hall. Some of the students seemed to
be beginning to resent his actions, and
later in the afternoon, at an open
forum, he was asked why he’d excluded
the ABC team.
“I had definite reasons that I can’t
reveal,” he said, adding that the organ-
isers had invited the TDT team, “and
it was no doubt an oversight on their
part that my permission wasn’t asked.
But even if it had I wouldn’t have
given it. That’s no reflection on your
activities here, or the ABC, but I didn’t
think it was a place for them to be.”
And with that the students had to be
content.
Mr. Vaughan Hinton, of the Aus-
tralian Council of Churches, Mrs.
Barbara Thiering, a lecturer in Synoptic
Studies at the University of Sydney,
and Rev. Harold Harkaway, a Jewish
minister, made up the rest of the
forum’s panel.
Mr. Hinton talked about the Fourth
Assembly of, the World Council of
Churches in Uppsala: “The moral issue
of the conference was whether Churches
can continue to behave as they have in
the past, knowing the majority of people
in the world are being denied access
to its riches.”
Mrs. Thiering made a plea for open-
mindedness (“the conviction ‘I have
the truth’ can lead to a sort of immatur-
ity in yourself”), and Rev. Harkaway
was hopeful for “spiritual co-operation
between Jews and Gentiles,” but “all
this hatred of Jev built into the Chris-
tian canon must be taken out. Only
then can we start talking of love and
ecumenism.”
Perhaps the most revealing remarks
were those made in the small-group
discussion between the students them-
selves. They sat on the grass, surrounded
by Wahroonga gum trees and that
special atmosphere of North Shore
calm, and talked about papal infallibil-
ity, the Trinity, the Virgin Mary’s place
in the Catholic Church, and one girl,
who was probably about 15, said sadly:
“We started off united. Jesus made the
Church, and it’s man who’s complicated
everything. Somebody’s going to have
to disbelieve.”
Ironing out differences after the
conference


Backing the best bets
IT MAY no longer be news that a man
can bite a dog but things have got so
mixed up in Australia that it is now
news that our main farming industries
are supremely efficient, or thereabouts,
by world standards. What with our re-
jection of the old nationalist rural
ethos, and our legitimate complaints
about the over-subsidising of some rural
industries, we have lost faith in a
proposition we once held as self-
evident: that, overall, we are one of
the most successful farming nations in
the world.
Now that the Federal Country Party
leadership itself is beginning to shake
some of the feathers out of the farmers’
beds with a new approach to re-
structuring the dairy industry and with
a new approach to wheat subsidies—-it
is worth chronicling our efficiencies as
MORE OF THIS
farmers. Ibis now becomes worth do-
ing because it can suggest policies for
decreasing the amount of resources we
now devote to inefficient farming, so
that we can turn them to better use.
It is the kind of rural industry that
makes fullest use of our greatest
natural resource wide open spaces
—that is most efficient. We are able to
dominate the wool market, for instance,
because no one else has such vast areas
of cheap pastureland. This is our
greatest natural advantage over other
countries.
It also makes us a highly efficient
nation in meat production. Take a com-
parison between Australia and other
beef producers in different parts of the
world. In Sweden beef costs the con-
sumer almost five times as much as it
does in Australia; in Norway about 3J
times as much; in Switzerland almost
three times as much; in the EEC
countries about 2.4 times as much.
In U.S. cents per kilogram the cost
of beef in Japan is 58c, in the U.S.
52c, in Denmark and Britain 49c, in
Canada 38c, in Argentina 31c. In
Australia it is only 28c. But while the
price of beef when freely traded is
around the Australian figure, Australians
cannot sell as much beef as they would
like to because other countries have
import quotas or high tariffs which
keep out cost-competitive Australian
beef. The protection these tariffs give
ranges from 50 percent to 300 percent.
In wheat we have almost as good
a story, although this time Argentina
is ahead of us. In terms of U.S. $ per
metric ton, wheat costs $B7 in the
EEC countries, $66 in Russia, $62 in
Canada, $53 in the U.S., $5l in Aus-
tralia, $3l in Argentina.
Even in butter and milk production,
in which we sometimes mistakenly see
ourselves as supremely inefficient, our
dairyfarmers manage to produce milk
for a price lower than in every country
except New Zealand. In terms of U.S.
cents per kilogram, here is the line-up:
Switzerland 12.1 c, Norway 11.5 c, Fin-
land 11.4 c, Sweden 10.5 c, Japan 9.5 c,
Britain 9.3 c, U.S.A. 9.3 c, EEC 9.2 c,
Canada 6.8 c, Denmark 6c, Ireland
5.8 c, Australia 5.3 c, New Zealand 5.1 c.
The trouble with our dairy industry
is not that it is inefficient as a whole
but that, for political reasons, we pay
a high price to sustain the marginal
farms within the industry—and that, for
no fault of its own, it can’t find foreign
markets.
What are we comparatively ineffici-
ent in producing? Sugar, bananas,
peanuts, cotton, tobacco, and other
products that are grown in under-
developed countries and, to a lesser
extent, vine products. This compara-
tive inefficiency is due partly to poor
rainfall. Even in our tropical areas
rainfall is erratic and in the vine-grow-
ing districts we seem to need more
elaborate irrigation than in the Medi-
terranean or the West Coast of the
U.S.A., with whom we compete. How-
ever, there seem to be some other pro-
ducts—rice and the sorghums are ex-
amples—in which we could become
competitive if present research and
seed-breeding is successful.
So what? It looks as if we should
concentrate our resources on the big
extensive rural activities wool, meat,
wheat. We are most efficient in these
particular industries because these are
the industries that can make fullest
use of our greatest natural asset —the
wide open spaces that are so scarce
in today’s world. When we go into
irrigation we are often at a disadvan-
tage, because a competitor may have
adequate natural rainfall so that he
does not have to spend money bring-
ing water to his product as we do.
But it is not our efficient rural indus-
tries to which we devote the most
attention. For political reasons the
assistance money tends to go to those
industries that are in trouble, thereby
holding things as they are when, if
we are to be efficient, things should
be changing. Just over half the assist-
ance to rural industries goes to the
sugar and dairying industries alone,
yet these two industries face dismally
poor prospects in world markets. (It
is not inefficiency that creates the
dairy industry’s crisis, but the fact
that there is no buoyant world demand
for its products; the sugar industry on
the other hand is inefficient, as well
as lacking 'markets.) Although these
two industries between them earn less
than seven percent of the nation’s
export income they get considerably
more Government encouragement and
LESS OF THIS
assistance than the wool, meat, and
wheat industries put together, even
though these three earn half our export
income and will continue to decide our
prosperity as a trading nation as far
ahead as we can see.
As the following figures show, we
seem to subsidise rural industries in
inverse proportion to their use to us.
Sugar earns us only an eighth of the
export income that wool earns, but gets
twice as much financial assistance.
Dairying earns us only a quarter as
much in export income as wheat. But
gets slightly more in financial
assistance.
Assistance Exports Production
Sugar . . s6om. SIOO $146
Dairying s4sm. SIOO S4OO
Wheat . s4om. S4OO S7OO
Meat .. slom. S3OO SBOO
Wool .. s3om. SBOO $825
Another way of looking at it has been
provided by the Bureau of Agricul-


tural Economics, which has worked
out a proportionate rate of assistance
to export income. The figures are now
a bit out of date, but several years ago
the running was bananas 79 percent,
peanuts 62 percent, sugar 60 percent,
butter 56 percent, tobacco 51 percent,
cotton 48 percent, dates 42 percent,
onions 40 percent, sultanas 33 percent,
rice 31 percent, passionfruit 29 percent,
eggs 11 percent, wheat 10 percent, meat
and wool one to two percent.
In addition to this direct assistance
to particular industries, the farming
industry as a whole gets its share of
the general indirect assistance to
country areas. In most States electi-
tricity and water charges and freight
charges are set so that city people sub-
sidise country users. Telephone charges
are higher in the city even though
country telephones are more expensive
to provide and maintain. Road expen-
ditures are heavily twisted in favor of
country people, despite the fact that
by far the biggest economic benefits
are to be gained by spending the
money where the shortage of road
space is greatest in the big metro-
politan area. Petrol price equalisation
payments financed by taxpayers gen-
erally pay for the cost of carting fuel
out to the country. Every tractor is
subsidised.
To price these special favors in
terms of assistance to farmers (other
country dwellers also benefit from
them) would take a major study pro-
ject. But it seems a safe guess that
they add up to somewhere between
SSO 'million and SIOO million a year.
In addition, there are the special tax
benefits of farmers. If direct assistance
to farming costs the rest of the com-
munity about S2OO million a year,
and indirect assistance is somewhere
between SIOO and S2OO million, one
can risk the conclusion that S3OO mil-
lion to S4OO million assistance a year
is a lot of money for a sector of
industry that provides about S2OOO
million a year.
In fairness one should add, of course,
that the manufacturing industries in
Australia are also highly protected.
We don’t know quite how heavily
because no one has added up the
great 'multiplicity of tariff rates. The
usual guess at an average rate of pro-
tection for manufacturing is put at
about 30 percent, which makes it even
higher than farming.
However that may be, there is still
the question of how we should go about
concentrating more of our resourcgs
on the farming industries at which we
are most efficient. Unfortunately it is
not just a question of a simple switch
in resources. Sales are not just
matter of supply, but of markets. It’s
no good producing something for
export if no foreigners are going to
buy it. Here Australia has two prob-
lems. In the case of wool, although
the wool market is free, synthetics
provide dangerous competition. In case
of meat and wheat, there are diffi-
culties in the protection of other
countries, which keep our meat and
wheat out, despite our greater
efficiency.
Except for the duty of 25c in the
United States, world trade in wool is
not restricted by protective tariffs and
quotas. Abolition of the U.S. duty
might lift sales a bit, but the future
of wool is likely to be determined
mainly by consumer demand in the big
industrial countries. And, according to
most analysts, its success in these
markets is going to depend on meet-
ing prices with synthetics. This means
that the trend of wool prices will be
down. This does not mean, however,
that demand for wool cannot increase,
nor that growing it cannot be profit-
able: what it does mean is that produc-
tivity must increase. It is extraordinary
that we devote so much in the way
of resources to a dud industry such as
sugar-growing and so little to wool, in
which we could both increase pro-
ductivity by encouraging greater
efficiency and compensate woolgrowers
for living in a protected, high-cost
economy when at the same time they
have to sell in open competition against
a competitor on world markets.
So far as meat and wheat are con-
cerned, the basic world consumer de-
mands are no problem. The problem
lies in restrictions in international trade,
in the systems of duties, levies, and
quotas by which other countries exclude
our comparatively efficiently produced
wheat and meat so that they can pro-
tect their comparatively inefficient
wheat and meat farmers. The future
of even the most marginal N.S.W. North
Coast dairyfarm would look quite
bright if other countries, less efficient
at dairying than we are, would buy our
dairy products instead of protecting
their own comparatively inefficient
dairyfarmers.
A sudden general liberalisation of
world trade would vastly expand to
markets not only for our meat and
wheat, but for almost all of our rural
products, so great is our cost advan-
tage over most other countries. If this
happened, costs wouldn’t matter at
least for a time. It would just be a
matter of expanding production. But it
is silly to talk like this. Radical liberal-
isation simply isn’t a goer.
But some negotiated liberalisation
may be possible in some industries.
Beef is the best example. Beef is the
most heavily protected of all food
items and in Europe at least there is
already strong awareness of how this
puts up food prices for ordinary people.
Something might be done about it.
The beef-eaters of Japan, North
America, and Europe are asked to pay
$2 to $3 for a pound of steak. In
them we have tremendous potential
allies for our beef industry. Unfortun-
ately we do not have the same
potential allies for our wheat industry,
since wheat prices are a relatively
small part of the final cost of wheat
products. In any case there isn’t the
same potential expansion in demand
for wheat as there is in meat, since as
people get more prosperous they tend
to eat more meat and less wheat
products.
This suggests one important line in
Government policy a priority on
meat as an expansion industry. Our
trade negotiators should put the
highest priority on meat in their
efforts to break down trade barriers.
Of course, for this to be successful, the
Government would have to turn
exisiting trade policies upside down.
The main reason for our part failure
to gain increased markets through
lowered trade barriers has been that
we have not been prepared to lower
our side of the barrier in return. Pro-
tectionist policies for manufacturers
have been so sacred that we have often
foregone large potential gains in agri-
cultural exports.
It is all very well for Mr. McEwen T
as he did recently, to denounce as a
“new and pernicious concept” the
variable tariff levies which operate to
protect European farmers against Aus-
tralian competition. But how seriously
can the Europeans take this when
they know that Mr. McEwen has just
introduced the same device on behalf
of his own country’s chemical and tex-
tile industries?
It is time that we took a more
economic view of assisting the men on
the land. Most of the schemes of assist-
ance to farmers were conceived as being
necessary to add to the security of the
rural population: to provide them with
a degree of immunity against the fluc-
tuations in returns that the free market
produced. But what initially begins as a
“stabilisation” scheme can easily be-
come a “subsidy” scheme. While it may
have been intended to stabilise incomes
by taking from the farmer in a good'
year and giving back to him in a bad
year, politics declare all years to be bad
years so that the taxpayers simply pay
out all the time. This is what happened
to the so-called “stabilisation” schemes
for wheat, dried fruits, and sugar. Other
schemes are openly subsidy schemes
without any pretence of stabilisation.
Whatever the social and political
justice of these schemes, their economic
implications, and assessments of their
real cost should not be ignored. Put-
ting money into a particular industry
means that land, machinery, buildings,
chemicals, and the skills and sweat of
men go into one activity rather than
the other. So many resources go into
propping up the sugar and dairying in-
dustries that if assistance disappeared
there would be a substantial difference
in how Australia employs its resources.
If assistance to farmers directs resources
into areas of relatively low productivity,
this means that the economy generally
suffers: if, on the other hand, assistance
to farmers goes to areas of high pro-
ductivity, the economy gains. It would
seem to be of great importance to Aus-
tralia that we should now put more of
our money on the good bets in rural
industry and that such money as we
spend on the bad bets should be in
helping farmers to get out of inefficient
industries altogether.


The South
Pacific prepares
for invasion
By SHIRLEY BARKER
Australian tourists look over the market
in Suva
IT TAKES a lot to startle the Pacific.
A hurricane can ruffle it; General de
Gaulle’s bomb experiments cause slight
turbulence; a fall in the price of copra
can make ripples. Yet the wheelings
and dealings of airline executives on
three continents are sending out shock
waves that are being felt in the remot-
est corners of the 68 million square
miles of blue ocean known as the South
Pacific.
Most recent move was an announce-
ment that Fiji Airways Ltd. had taken
on two new shareholders, and that the
four major parents had doubled their
capital investment in the company.
Joining Qantas, BOAC, Air New Zea-
land, and the Fiji Government, who
own Fiji Airways, are the Government
of Tonga and the Western Pacific High
Commission. The four major share-
holders have increased their individual
capital investment from $127,700 to
$257,500 each. Western Pacific High
Commission administers for Britain the
Solomons, Gilbert and Ellice Islands,
and the British side of the Condo-
minium of the New Hebrides.
The announcement was yet another
straw in the trade wind to indicate that
big-time tourism is coming to the South
Pacific. There’s little doubt now that
it will be engulfed by jumbo jetloads
of tourists within the next few years.
Some islands and territories are mak-
ing preparations, some want to but have
no idea how to go about it, others
would rather it all passed them by. But
in the end, it will be the world’s major
airlines that will make the decisions
for them. Those decisions already are
being made, mainly in Washington,
D.C., where the Civil Aeronautics
Board is conducting an exhaustive hear-
ing into who should fly where in the
Pacific. Fiji Airways’ moves are a sign
of the tightening up that’s happening
in the Pacific itself.
A BOAC official in London recently
described the South Pacific as “a treas-
ure chest, ripe for the picking.” Facts
and figures bear him out. Of the 130
million people who travelled overseas
last year, little more than two million
went anywhere near the Pacific, and
only about 60,000 of them dropped
down for brief stays in the South Pacific.
Most of them went to South-East Asia
and Australia. The tourist flow between
Europe and North America accounted
for 76 percent of the total world move-
ment. Most travel experts are of the
opinion that Europe has almost reached
Pacific islanders watch the tourists
watching them
saturation point as a vacation area for
Americans.
The emergence of the huge jets in the
early 1970 s is expected to bring Pacific
fares tumbling. The real aim is to get
at the younger Americans, and to double
or treble the numbers of Australians go-
ing to the Pacific area. Average age of
American tourists in the area currently
is high, about 45, of Australians much
lower, 25 to 35. The emphasis will be
away from rich elderly Americans to
young adventurous ones, to Australian
families where Mum and Dad are
around 30, and bright young ones
in their 20s. New Zealanders, for the
time being, are regarded as something
of a loss due to that country’s restric-
tions on travel allowances.
What Hawaii does today, Fiji soon
will do. And what Fiji does today, the
rest of the South Pacific will be doing
tomorrow. Aside from Hawaii, which
most people in the islands regard with
a mixture of envy and horror—envy at
Hawaii’s tourism wealth (one million
tourists a year and rising fast); horror
at what’s happened to the place—Fiji
is leading the field with 56,000 visitors
a year, excluding the 20,000 or so cruise
passengers calling for one day.
The world’s major airlines are making
the big push into the Pacific. Even the
most sophisticated of transportation
experts cannot yet unravel the complex
tangle of arguments, lobbyings, conces-
sions given and received, or “just plain
horse-trading,” as one Australian airline
man calls it, that’s going on in Wash-
ington at the moment.
What has emerged so far is that
Eastern Airlines has been recommended
as the airline to fly directly into the
Pacific from the eastern seaboard of
the U.S. (a very rich, untapped market
for the Pacific). However, there’s a lot
between being recommended and get-
ting final permission, which must come
from the Civil Aeronautics Board,
International Air Transport Associa-
tion, and the President of the United
States himself.
Then, quite casually during the hear-
ings, Pan American World Airways
announced it intended starting a
scheduled service between American and
Western Samoa this month. The two
Samoas, especially independent Western
Sa'moa, still haven’t recovered from the
shock. Pan American last month tried
to increase its weekly flights to Australia
from seven to 12, but the Department
of Civil Aviation allowed only nine.
The U.S.’s mighty Continental Air-
lines also is making a bid for the area.
The airline recently bought into Air
Micronesia which covers the U.S. Trust
territories of the Marianas and the
Carolines, flying in from Honolulu.
Continental is planning a chain of six
hotels through the Trust territories, one
of them at Pago Pago, American
Samoa. Work on this hotel, of 100
rooms, will start soon, and be completed
before the end of 1969.
Continental’s plans for the South
Pacific are virtually open-ended. As its
air service develops, it is prepared to
extend even farther. There is in exist-
ence a huge dossier giving co'mplete
details of practically every island in the
Pacific, its airstrip needs, accommoda-
tion requirements, right down to what’s
needed to fill the days of each and every
tourist who might visit. Such precise
planning over such a long term leaves
island developers awestruck.
Pan American’s announcement of a
service between the two Samoas hit
them “like a bombshell,” according to
one local busii&ssman. Earlier, the two
Samoas had intimated that they would
prefer to see tourist development
financed from within rather than from
without. Pan American already has a


hotel, the Inter-Continental, in Pago
Pago, and had shown some interest
in building in Apia, Western Samoa,
previously.
Being U.S. administered, American
Samoa will no doubt be carried along
on the development wave. Western
Samoa, on the other hand, is fiercely
independent, has its own airline, Poly-
nesian Airlines Ltd., and a Government
whose economic manoeuvres are
described as “elephantine” by a close
observer there. One marketing man who
has studied the local tourist set-up in
the South Pacific comments: “When
you get big mobs of tourists in Pago
Pago, what are you going to do with
them? There’s not enough to satisfy
them for long. They’ve got to be moved
on to Apia.”
But Western Samoa says it wants to
tap finance from within for tourist
development. The Government there
has been involved in negotiations with
TraveLodge Ltd. of Australia, which
has shown interest in building there.
At last count, the Government had made
three decisions the last one being
to “reconsider” the previous two of yes
and no.
If the Western Samoan Government
hasn’t yet made up its mind, Fiji’s has.
The series of moves just announced
reveal that Fiji and its partners in
Fiji Airways, BOAC, Qantas, and Air
New Zealand are well aware of the
threat looming in the 19705.
Tonga has been a key square on
the giant chessboard of the Pacific, on
which the airlines are playing their
complicated game. For a long time now,
Tonga has wanted its own domestic
airline, and has made no secret of the
fact it also wants an international air-
line, too. Being an independent king-
dom, it has every right to its own in-
ternational carrier, with all the world
landing rights that go with such a con-
dition. Whoever gets Tonga, gets virt-
ually unlimited potential in the Pacific,
or even farther afield. Now, with the
Tongan Government as a shareholder,
Fiji Airways probably will provide the
kingdom with its much desired domestic
service. In return, Fiji Airways (and its
airline parents) has the firmest foot-
hold of anyone in the whole area. And
the deal with the Western Pacific High
Commission provides the airline with
similar footings in the New Hebrides,
Gilbert and Ellice Islands, and the
Solomons, all of which have tourism
ambitions.
Only the vital link with Western
Samoa is left unmade yet. But Fiji is
attempting to do something about
this. When he was in Tonga, Fiji’s
Minister for Communications, Works,
and Tourism (in the islands everyone
wears at least two hats), Charles Stin-
son, said he was trying to arrange talks
with the Government of Western
Samoa. He made no bones about the
fact that the reason for all Fiji Air-
ways’ moves was to strengthen its
regional operations.
One idea gaining ground is that the
islands of the South Pacific must join
forces to promote themselves as a
vacation area rather than as individual
spots on the vast tourist map. Again,
Fiji has taken the lead, encouraged by
Hawaii. The idea is to form what they
call a Pacific necklace, to be promoted
as an area. Hawaii says it would be
willing to run the promotion, passing
on its tourists to “do” the South-West
Pacific, with tours staying a day or so
on each island. The notion took a step
forward recently when Charles Stinson,
as Fiji’s Minister responsible for tour-
ism, wrote to Tonga, American Samoa,
Western Satnoa, New Caledonia, New
Hebrides, and the Society Islands
(Tahiti) asking their views on the for-
mation of a South Pacific Islands Tour-
ist Promotion Program.
Few islands in the South Pacific are
without a Government tourist office of
some kind, even if it’s only a desk and
chair in the corner of another Govern-
ment department office. Fiji’s Visitors’
Bureau is Madison Avenue compared
with most; its output of promotional
material and statistics is prodigious, and
its efforts to entice travel agents are
vigorous. Even so, this organisation is
constantly short of money for ,what it
wants to do. This year the Bureau has
$312,000, of which $177,000 comes from
the Fiji Government, and most of the
remainder from private commerce. The
budget is far and away the biggest of
any tourist-promotional spending in
the South Pacific, with the exception
of Tahiti, which has around 25,000
tourists annually. The Fiji Visitors’
Bureau has asked the Government to
double its contribution on the basis of
$4 for each tourist estimated for the
year being budgeted.
Such businesslike thinking and plan-
ning are rare in the islands. Even the
day-to-day running of business is fraught
with lost files, telephone i .essages never
given, illiterately typed letters. An
advertising man in Western Samoa com-
plained that he made seven phone calls
to one office to locate one man, who
was less than 100 yards away. There is
much to commend the idea that instead
of the newly established University of
the South Pacific, in Fiji, running
courses in the Arts and Sciences, it
should concentrate its efforts on business
management and basic economics.
As new big capital moves in with its
attendant rigid requirements, the firms
who have been the area’s traditional
suppliers are going to have to change
their thinking. Even if the islanders
themselves don’t change greatly, the
men who will be coming in to run the
new enterprises are going to demand
deliveries on schedule, better invoicing
(to get the stuff through the tortuous
Customs departments of the various
islands), better packaging, and a gen-
erally more efficient attitude toward
the islands. Even the business houses
already in the islands are noticing
changes. For generations they have
lived and worked remote from the
mainstream of world commerce. Agen-
cies for overseas products were obtained,
and the markets have remained rela-
tively static, since little or no salesman-
ship has been applied. Commissions
just rolled in, and the islands wait
patiently for the next delivery of goods,
never knowing just when they will
arrive. Now, the companies manufactur-
ing those goods overseas are beginning
to come and take close personal looks
at this remote market. They are becom-
ing aware of the need to sell, to adver-
tise straight to the market, even to
setting up their own branch offices.
Additionally, there’s a growing aware-
ness, and Australia is being more per-
ceptive in this than any other country,
that the islands and territories of the
South Pacific cannot be left to fend
for themselves—even if they didn’t have
a rosy future in tourism. Strategically,
the islands are important to Australia.
The searching glances that Australia is
casting over her neighbors must include
the islands of the south seas. One Aus-
tralian businessman who has taken note,
and is trying to do something about it,
is R. B. Gall, managing director of
Camelec Ltd., Adelaide electrical manu-
facturer. Camelec has a subsidiary com-
pany in Fiji, manufacturing cables and
electrical parts. While Gall’s interest in
the islands isn’t completely altruistic,
he sees the necessity of Aus.-alian busi-
nessmen putting something more than
profit-earning money into the area.
Gall has come up with what is con-
sidered a novel and staggering idea to
the islands. He has suggested the forma-
tion of a South-West Pacific Co-opera-
tion Committee, along the lines of the
Australia-Japan Business Co-operation
Committee. He doesn’t like the idea of
the islands going cap-in-hand asking for
help piecemeal from the “haves.” He
suggests that if the islands band to-
gether they can present a very form-
idable case for business and social help
from countries like Australia and New
Zealand. Gall believes that Australian
businessmen now are sophisticated
enough to pass on their expertise to less
developed neighbors. He points to one
of two recent business deals the islanders
have negotiated for themselves over-
seas where they’ve got a very poor deal
indeed. A committee of the kind he
envisages could have gone over the
ground first and saved the islanders
quite a bit of money and worry. A local
businessman who was close to one of the
deals admits: “We just didn’t realise
what we were getting into. The people
we were dealing with (in a Northern
Hemisphere country) really pulled some
fast ones on us. Now we’ve got to do
the best we can with what we’ve
bought.”
The European who will be coming
in to do business in the islands over
the next decade or so will have to be
a very special breed. He’ll have to be
a good businessman, because his oppo-
sition will be there, too. But he will
have to be a diplomat and patient
teacher, too, able to ride out the crisis
that occurs when a system breaks down
or while a piece of expensive
machinery rusts waiting for a new part
from the other side of the world.


BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
The discreet crack
of a Japanese whip
1967-68 vehicle imports from Japan were $16 million
IT IS BEGINNING to dawn on even
the more reactionary members of the
Government that the trade whip could
well be in the Japanese hands. At least
it seems to have been cracked over
the Australian Woolgrowers and
Graziers’ Association, which has sent a
plaintive letter to the Federal Govern-
ment asking that no further restrictions
should be imposed on Japanese car im-
ports for fear that Japan might cut its
purchases of Australian wool. It was
most unwise, said the Council, to sup-
pose that the Japanese had no alterna-
tives to Australian wool. They did; and
there was the threat of the Japanese
fibre industry, too.
A year of mutual bickerings have
chalked up a rise in the value of Aus-
tralian exports to Japan of $56 million
to $643 million, a rise in imports of
$47 million to $343 million, a $9 million
widening of the trade imbalance in
Australia’s favor to $299 million, and a
hardening of Japanese attitudes toward
Australia’s protectionist philosophies.
For the moment, Mr. McEwen is
standing firm against increasing pres-
sure from car manufacturers for more
protection against imports.
But a feeling that the Government
has no idea what to do for the motor
industry was given • support in Parlia-
ment last week. Mr. McEwen, in
answer to a question on the notice-
paper by Mr. Barnard, the Deputy
Leader of the Opposition, went out of
his way to defend the success of his
policy. Quoting 1966-67 as the latest
figures, he attempted to show that his
policy has succeeded in reducing im-
ports.
Forced to bear the very high costs of
full Australianisation on short-produc-
tion runs, several firms have been in
severe difficulty since 1966-67. They
have been hard hit by the strong com-
petition of the new generation of Jap-
anese cars.
Mr. McEwen is facing not only the
car manufacturers but import figures,
which show that the Japanese have
boosted their car exports here last year
from $23 million to nearly $37 million,
lorries and trucks from $B.B million to
$10.9 million, and have almost doubled
the flow of vehicle parts and acces-
sories.
On the other hand, Australia’s major
export to Japan, wool, has dropped in
value from $272 million to $244 million,
and although the fall was partly
accountable through lower prices being
paid for wool at auction, the wool-
growers and graziers seem most con-
cerned that their biggest customer
should suffer no further upsets. They
are recommending greater competition
throughout Australian industry instead.
Apart from cars, the Japanese
achieved their encouraging rise in
exports to Australia in those few fields
where they are relatively free to
trade here. Metal manufactures were
up $6 million to $40.2 million;
machinery up $4 million to $4B
million; textiles up $4 million to $75
million; plastics up $3 million to
$10.5 million; and scientific instruments
up $2 million to $10.4 million. But
such rises are not going to make the
Japanese more tolerant to the still-
widening trade gap; not that they are
demanding a bilateral balance of
trade. Japan has put its faith in multi-
lateral arrangements which leave it
free to shop around irrespective of its
export position with any particular
country. But, with the world export
market becoming more competitive
and in some instances shrinking, it is
hardly surprising that it should now
be seeking a far better deal with such
a reliant trading partner as Australia.
The brash Australian attitude
toward such Japanese reasoning has
been engendered in the belief that they
are in desperate need of Australia’s raw-
materials exports. Wool easily led the
list last year at $244 million, with iron
ore at $BB million scheduled to be
running it a close second within a few
years, and coal showing healthy signs
of growth also ($B4 million last year).
Wool, it was argued, held the strongest
position because Japan really had no
alternative; but somehow the Japanese
have managed to convince the wool-
growers of the contrary. As for iron
ore and coal and other minerals, Aus-
tralia offers highly competitive ter’ms
for the qualities and quantities
required. It suits Japan to buy these
things from here, just as it suits her
to buy even more iron ore from Chile
and India, or coal from Canada.
At a recent meeting of the Economic
Society of Australia and New Zealand,
it was suggested by both Australian
and Japanese academics that Australia
is likely to become both far more
dependent on trade with Japan than
it is at present and less able to bargain
from a position of strength. Within a
decade it is forseen that between 35
and 40 percent of Australian exports
would be going to Japan and about
20 percent of its Imports coming from
there.
Neither an objective of balanced
trade in real terms or on a per capita
basis was valid, pointed out Professor
Moriguchi, formerly of Japan’s
Economic Planning Committee and
currently a visiting Professor of Econ-
omics at the University of N.S.W.: “In
the world of multilateral trade there is
no point in adhering to bilateral trade
balances. The trade balances between
the particular two countries will be up
to their bargaining positions against
each other”; and, “In view of increas-
ing Australian exports to Japan, Japan
might be able to hold a stronger bar-
gaining position.”
Suddenly, even the most emotive
Japanese opponents in Canberra seem
almost ready to agree.
PROTECTIONISM
SPREADING REVOLT
THE TARIFF BOARD’S chairman,
Mr. Alf Rattigan, went right into the
lions’ den last week in Canberra. He
accepted an invitation to speak to the
executive of the Associated Chamber
of Manufactures. Fifty members, rep-


resenting manufacturers from all over
Australia, filed out of an old brown
Canberra bus into the Canberra Hotel,
where they held a private luncheon.
Mr. Rattigan didn’t seem to enjoy
his ordeal much. His talk was a familiar
recital of the Board’s plans to publish
a classification of industries by degree
of protection. A shy, retiring man in
public, Mr. Rattigan is reported to have
taken quite a beating at question time.
He admitted, in answer to questions,
that the Board was not concerned about
whether its decisions put people out of
work. Full employment was a problem
for the Commonwealth Government.
This is a point which will be used
against Mr. Rattigan’s new policies.
He also admitted that the Board
would not be concerned with the effects
of tariff changes on prices.
When he first came to the Board to
be its chairman, he had asked members
how they saw their role. They saw an
analogy with a court: the Board’s job
was to adjudicate a dispute between
two parties. This, he had felt from the
beginning, was an inadequate approach
to the problem, and he had been deter-
mined to develop criteria which related
tariff policy to the broader objectives
of the Government economic growth
in particular.
Meanwhile, in Parliament, the revolt
against protectionism continued to
develop, and the political support for
McEwen dwindled. In the Party room
on Wednesday, he was subjected to a
concerted criticism. The leader of the
anti-protectionists was Mr. Maisey, the
Country Party member for Moore, in
Western Australia. He spoke his mind
in Parliament, too, after Mr. McEwen
had found he did not have the numbers
to muzzle Mr. Maisey:
“The exporting group has been, by
definition, the more efficient producer.
This is simply because exporters have
to be able to undersell competing pro-
ducers in world markets, often in the
competitor’s own country. It stands to
reason that anyone who produces in
Australia has to meet shipping costs,
say to Germany, and then beats his
German rivals at their own game and
in their own backyard must be pretty
efficient. He is certainly a good deal
more efficient than the other producer,
the one who sells his wares at home,
in Australia, and seldom, if ever, ven-
tures abroad to compete. Of course,
there is a pretty deep-seated reason
why some industries have the efficiency
and potential to compete abroad while
others have not. The reason is that
Australia’ is especially endowed has
special God-given advantages—in some
types of production, whereas for other
lines of production the Australian
environment is discouraging.
“We have vast tracts of land ideally-
suited for grazing and agricultural pur-
suits. Our waters have crayfish and
prawns in abundance. And underneath
this land and underneath these waters
lie huge, largely untapped, mineral
resources of the highest quality. These
are the mainsprings for our most
efficient export industries. These were
MEN AND MATTERS
IT HAS BEEN nose to the grindstone
pretty well all the time for Max Wilson,
GM-H’s managing director, since nearly
three years ago, when he succeeded
David Hegland. His task was to stop
the erosive rot in GM-H’s market share,
and he has had to bring all his bound-
less energies and ingenuity to it, leaving
precious little time to developing a
public image, as his two predecessors
succeeded in doing, and little else apart
from attending to his domestic sphere
(he has a wife and two children) and
an occasional swim. His dedication to
company duty has, however, paid off.
The company’s market share in July
was up to 35.9 percent, unofficially
beating this in August, and on the trade
say-so heading rapidly toward the 40s.
At 45 he still looks to have almost
as much of his career ahead as at his
back, even the 22 years or so he has
already served with GMC in various
countries. Apart from the U.S., his
operational posts have included Belgium
•—where he picked up his motto, “be
Max Wilson
Sam Harp
enthusiastic” — Denmark, and South
Africa. His life with CMC started just
after the war, in which he served with
the U.S. Air Force, being shot down
in the process over Europe, captured,
and escaped from a p.o.w. camp. But
before any of this happened he had
graduated in mechanical engineering
at the University of Nebraska, in the
State of his birth.
Like all good GMC men, Wilson is
modest about his own part in the com-
pany’s improved market performance.
He prefers to put it down to teamwork
rather than to his own inspired judg-
ments on the needs of the market,
which range increasingly toward luxury
vehicles and less toward basic transpor-
tation, on which the former big markets
were largely built up. Doubtless, of
course, particular departments in
GM-H, such as those responsible for
styling and design, could be singled out
as the leading handmaidens of recovery,
but for putting in long hours the chief
executive takes the palm (he has even
had to forsake his golf and fishing, and
apparently gets his main relaxation
driving cars around the company’s prov-
ing ground at Lang Lang, in Gipps-
land). And behind the whole effort
lies Wilson’s correct assessment that
the day for personalising transport has
arrived, and with it has arisen the com-
pany’s need to serve the young and
affluent, as well as the older, age
groups, something, in fact, the whole
commercial world is learning fast.
SAM HARP and Bruce Stuart were a
lively pair as the boom of the late
1950 s swept to its climax in September,
1960. It is now seven years since their
H. and S. Credits group crashed, taking
into oblivion with it about $4 million
in depositors’ funds along with the
Standard Insurance Co. of New Zea-
land.
But the story of company crashes
is more than simply a list of depositors’
losses. What has happened to Harp
and Stuart, the two energetic young ex-
servicemen who set out to create an
empire in the late 1950 s and who ended
up in the bankruptcy court? Now only
43, they have not emerged from the
bankruptcy they entered in 1963-64.
But Sam Harp, an affable, friendly
livewire, is no longer the nurseryman
he then described himself as; now he
works for a York Street fancy goods
importing establishment run by B. K.
Harp, the same man that appears in
the telephone directory against Sam
Harp’s North Shore address in exclu-
sive Warrawee.
And Bruce Stuart, described as a
company director at the time of his
sequestration order, then went to the
country to run his wife’s wheat prop-
erty at Coolah.
In 1950 they got together to form
Harp and Stuart Pty. Ltd. to operate
a wholesale jewellery business. Because
of a slump in trade in 1953 they
decided to sell direct, and formed H.
and S. Credits Pty. Ltd., selling on a
door-to-door basis to the public.
With insufficient funds to expand,
they turned H. and S. Credits public
in 1955. By then they had extended
into linens and blankets, and to create
a history to assist them in obtaining
stock-exchange listing, they bought a
majority shareholding in a run-down
company, Bloch and Gerber Ltd.
The success of H. and S. Credits
was enhanced by Standard Insurance
Co. Ltd. of New Zealand giving
guarantees on behalf of the company
to the extent of $2 million. But when
the boom ended and the ratio of re-
investments to refunds swung from
70-30% to 30-70%, Standard Insurance
felt the need to invest $1 million in
cash in the company, taking a deben-
ture over the whole of the company’s
undertakings as security. But $1 mil-
lion was nowhere near enough to hold
up this house of cards when the chill
winds blew in 1961
In May, 1961, Standard Insurance
petitioned for the winding up of H.
and S. Credits, and itself went into
liquidation. i


the industries that started Australia
going. I refer to wool, wheat, gold
copper, and coal. There was no protec-
tion. The other things that we needed
we imported from other countries which
were good and efficient at making
them.
“Once we had wide areas of manu-
facturing receiving tariffs, the cost of
living and of producing other com-
modities soon went up. This is an inevi-
table result of tariffs, which are taxes
on imports, making imports dearer, the
objective being, of course, to allow
Australian manufacturers, who are
inefficient by world standards, to raise
their prices to meet their costs of pro-
duction and make profits. The exten-
sion of tariff protection to wider and
wider areas meant higher costs and
prices for everyone. Everyone had fresh
problems, even if most people did not
realise where these problems originated.
The important feature of these prob-
lems was that most people could even-
tually do something about them, while
one group could not counter them at
all.
“Employees, as a whole, can and do
resort to arbitration to maintain living
standards in the face of rising prices
and costs.
“Tariff protection for the inefficient
has pulled down and crippled the
efficient, because it is they who finish
paying the greater part of the bill.”
COAL FOR JAPAN
A BUYER'S MARKET?
IRON ORE from the West, valued at
$BB million, and black coal, from the
East, valued at $B4 million, left Aus-
tralia last year to feed the steel mills
of Japan. In the swiftly rising minerals
export trade, by no means all the
honors go to Western Australia. Iron
ore exports with a total va’ue of $lOO
million did, in fact, exceed total coal
exports by some $l3 million and are
expected to have reached $220
million by 1975. But the value of coal
exports is expected to grow at a
rapid rate also.
Last week a top-level delegation
from Japan’s steel, chemical, and gas
industries arrived to inspect coal re-
sources in N.S.W. and Queensland.
During 1967-68 N.S.W. produced 28
million of Australia’s total 36.8
million tons of black coal and supplied
eight million of the 10.35 million tons
exported. But with the present mission
concentrating its interest mostly on
the Bowen Basin deposits in central
Queensland, N.S.W. cannot be ex-
pected to hold the premier coal-
exporting title for much longer.
Measured deposits of black coal in
the Bowen Basin area are roughly put
at 1500 million tons, estimated reserves
are put closer to 3000 million tons,
while it is inferred that these could
well be in the 5500 million-ton region.
It sounds more than enough, but the

Speculator’s Diary
SWIMMING AGAINST
THE MARKETS
FLOOD OF RUMORS
UNFORTUNATELY, this speculator
was in too contrary a mood last week
to agree that the market could be right,
and so spent his time swimming against
the tide in the sort of venture that can
either bring substantial rewards or sub-
stantial losses. My contrary act was to
buy Oil Search shares after the market
slumped on news that Esso had struck
gas instead of oil at the Ini well, in
Oil Search’s area off the Papuan coast.
The shares had been as high as $1.35
not so long ago; the reaction to only
95c looked too severe, despite the
flood of rumors that many of the
informed buyers of recent times from
Papua were now sellers, that the gas
was not much good, anyhow, and that
there was salt water in the hole.
Even if Ini does turn out to be a
flop itself, and this is yet to be proven,
the existence of hydrocarbons must be
a significant incentive to Esso to try
again in the area. But in any event it
is relevant to look at what Quentin
Cameron had to say in a recent issue of
his “Oil Digest” that came out some
time before the gas news. “It should
be emphasised that, unlike most wells
in which there are high hopes of an
oil discovery, the initial presence of gas
should be the cause of rejoicing rather
than lamentations. This is because in
the Uramu structure the gas zone is
believed to overlie an oil zone and,
from available information, if it can be
described as such, the oil zone at the
Uramu well was about 2000 ft. below
the gas zone.”
The Ini well struck gas at 6380 ft.,
and last week was at 6401 ft. out of its
target depth of 10,000 ft., so there is
still a lot of drilling to be done. The
Uramu well, 13 miles away, hit gas at
6169 ft. early this year, and was drilled
ahead to a basement of 10,106 ft. Test-
ing of further hydrocarbons encountered
below the gas find was about to com-
mence in March, when bad weather
forced the tests to be suspended until
late this year. If the wells’ similarities
continue, then further hydrocarbons
could be encountered at Ini at greater
depth. Another well in the area that
struck gas but found no oil deeper was
Pasca, 50 miles south of Uramu, where
gas flowed from 7211 ft. to 7245 ft.
Maybe it’s throwing good money after
bad, but I bought another 1500 shares
to add to my existing holding.
Playing the takeover game can be a
rewarding bit of fun. The Melbourne
broking house of John N. Robertson
Thompson & Co. suggested to its clients
last week that they should consider
joining in the game now that the min-
ing market has lost so much vivacity.
The firm pointed to the strong signs
Ahat the takeover game was on the
march in Australia, following the news
about Mt. Morgan, Prestige, King
Island Scheelite, Robert Bryce, McLaren
Industries, and a whole swag of insur-
ance companies. So it seemed a good
idea to join in and select a company
that could, for various reasons, be taken
over. And the one I settled on is a
small Victorian tomato sauce and
pickles maker, White Crow Ltd.
This little company, with only 612,639
shares on issue (plus 31,250 preference
shares), has had quite a run in the
Melbourne market recently, going up
from 47 cents earlier in the year to
75 cents last week but still leaving
the price well below the book assets
backing per share of 97 cents. It seems
likely that the drought in Victoria will
once again have made things tough for
White Crow in the year that ended last
June; in the previous year the high
price of tomatoes and intensive com-
petition from rivals like Heinz and Tom
Piper had chopped its profit and divi-
dend in half, to 8.8 percent on capital
and 6 percent, respectively.
The April interim report spoke of an
improvement in overall trading, but
there were no profit forecasts, because
the main production period is in the
second half of the year. The previous
year’s problems are reported to have
chopped White Crow’s share of the
Victorian tomato sauce market from
about 40 percent to less than one-third
but this is still an important enough
slice to give the company a strategic
position in the industry. And I’ve heard
from an interesting source (or is it
sauce?) that rivals could be looking at
the stock.
To pay for these ventures I quit my
remaining Slater Walker shares and
rights, as I fear a little market reaction
sooner or later, despite my continued
faith in the stock, to make $2436. This
has been one of my best results. I also
decided to take the good profit of $357
I was making on Ravensthorpe,
although there could be more in it yet,
and to face up to my loss of $3O on
Planet Metals. This leaves kitty at
$3358.

has cautiously pointed out that on a
known reserves per capita basis Aus-
tralia most certainly is not rich in
coal compared with many other
countries in the world: Australia could
only show 1200 tons of coal per head
of population compared with 3000
tons in the U.K. and 6000 tons in the
U.S.
The Japanese, on the other hand,
have no coal of their own and have
already written contracts under which
Australia will supply 17 million tons
a year by 1971, or some 36 percent
of Japan’s total needs. But Japan is
now in the process of lifting crude
steel production from the present 62
million tons a year to perhaps 90
million tons by 1975. And it will need
lots more coal to do so.
At the top of the present delegation’s
list is the North Blackwater project of
Utah-Mitsubishi and that of Clutha
development at Sirius Creek. Both are
in the Bowen Basin area and both have
a potential for four million tons of coal
a year after initial development costs in
the region of $lOO million each. Here,
the full power of the delegation’s
executives, engineers, and * geologists
will come into play, inspecting
proposed port and mine sites and rail
routes and checking management and
labor potential.
Also in Queensland, the coal reserves
at South Blackwater, which are con-
trolled by Thiess Brothers, and the
Bluff deposits of the Associated Oil
Group will be given at least brief
inspections. In N.S.W. the delegation
will be mostly interested in the West
Wallsend colliery of Coal and Allied
Industries, and there will be talks with
BHP on their small but strategically
placed Queensland area south-east of
Bluff. A visit to the new Coalcliff fields
of Kembla Coal and Coke remain a
possibility. And to all this must be
added the lively interest being shown by
Kanematsu-Gosho in the Swansea
mines of Silver Valley, near New-
castle.
From the Japanese point of view,
they are in a buyers’ market, and no
doubt intend to remain so. The inti-
mate knowledge they have of mining
operations and the united front that
Japanese industry presents when pur-
chasing more or less makes the accep-
tance of a virtual cost-plus formula for
contracts inevitable. They are also
averse to putting too many qf their
contracts into any one market, and the
current 36 percent share so far handed
out to Australia must be getting pretty
near the limit. They are currently
prospecting for coal in British Colum-
bia. And they are actively seeking new
technologies that could replace the
role of coal in steel manufacture
the injection of heavy oil into blast
furnaces is one such technique under
investigation.
But Australian coal is very cheap.
Earlier this year six of Japan’s largest
steel companies signed a 15-year
contract for Canadian coal at a price
of $lO.B a ton delivered to Vancouver,
while for the current Thiess-Peabody-
Mitsui project at Moura, in the Bowen
Basin, the price is thought to be $8.25
a ton delivered to Gladstone. The high
quality of the coal and the relative
ease of access are the main factors
involved. And they could ensure that
by 1972 Queensland’s ambition to
become Australa’s premier coal-export-
ing State will be realised.
AUSTRALIA-EUROPE SHIPPING
UPHEAVAL IN CANBERRA
TRADE MINISTER Mr. McEwen’s
prospective negotiations with British
shippers about buying into the Australia-
Europe run have caused considerable
upheaval in Canberra. By some, it is
being denounced as another anti-
development project. Treasury men,
who have costed out the proposal, say
it doesn’t make sense at all. Australia,
they claim, cannot compete without
massive subsidies in the form of direct
payments and large tax concessions.
The Department of Trade and In-
dustry, which is sponsoring the scheme,
says that its main objective is to provide
us with a bargaining weapon to shake
at the conference monopoly which cur-
rently dictates freight rates. Conference
rates are based on the average perform-
ance of a very mixed bag of 23 shipping
lines. Trade argues that with moderate
support a new Australian line, equipped
with modern ships, could compete
effectively. We couldn’t be as inefficient
as some of the lines which press up
average prices.
With a shipping line of our own in
the business, any threats we might want
to make to the conference to get freight
rates down to a reasonable level would
be credible. Threats to expand our own
line would work where threats to estab-
lish a line will not.
Trade Department people say there
isn’t very much in it from the foreign
exchange viewpoint. Foreign ships spend
so much in Australia in paying local
wharfage charges and buying local sup-
plies that they pay a great deal of the
foreign-exchange bill that their freight
charges incur. The ships will have to be
bought overseas, and there is even the
possibility that the scheme will provide
for crewing on British standards, which
wouldn’t do for the Australian seamen’s
union, and would therefore mean non-
Australian crews.
The Treasury has argued that any
foreign exchange savings can be made
far more cheaply in other ways. It
argues, too, that since foreign countries
are prepared to lose a lot of revenue in
concessions to their shipping lines, the
sensible policy is to just take advantage
of that.
They argue that we can bargain
freight rates down by tough negotiating
and a preparedness to break or threaten
to break the conference down by invit-
ing in outsiders.

BRIEFLY
The economy: Exports of manufactured goods in
1967-68 increased only 3.3 percent.
Mines at Broken Hill reached full production after a
decision by miners to resume work under
normal conditions.
Australia could replace the U.S. as Japan’s largest
supplier of coal by 1971, according to the leader
of a Japanese coal-investigation mission.
The markets: The week opened on Australian stock
markets on a promising note, with nickel expectations
which CRA and New BH did not fulfil, though they had
plenty of copper riches to divulge. CRA ended 80c down
for the week at $22.10, after hitting $24.60, and New BH,
ranging from $18.50 to $2l, finished 20c down at $l9.
King Island Scheelite added a dollar on receipt
of a bid, and Peko put on $l.lO to $l4.
Despite reports of oil or gas in three locations,
the oil market drifted, with Oil Search
plunging from the week’s peak of $1.40 to 95c at
week’s end on rumors of salt in the Ini well.
Basin shares and options were active.
BHP finished easier on the week. DHA and Henry Jones
had a good run, closing 42c and 55c higher respectively
at $1.93 and $3.60. Osti ran up to $3.05 before
being cut back to $2.60. The Kingsway
group was also sought after.
A good spread of buying among industrials pushed
the London index above 500 on Friday, for the
first time in the week.
Wall Street took encouragement at the end from rising
car and retail sales, a jump in building
activity, and completion of the round of discount
rate reductions.
Companies: Results for the year to June came rolling
in ... It was a stunning result from Associated Pulp
and Paper, which reported a 53 percent profit growth, after
considerably lower depreciation provision; payout was
lifted one percent to 10 percent . . . Bradmill Industries
(formerly Bradford Cotton) overcame greater
tax liability to produce record profit of $1.68 million . . .
Miscalculation of Australian tastes in casual
wear slammed Hilton’s profits down from $815,000
to $397,000 . . . For the June half, Courtaulds earned
only slightly better than in the same period of 1967,
and interim dividend of three percent is unchanged.
A cut-back on tyre losses and improvement in
general products enabled SA Rubber to lift profits from
$753,000 to $949,000 . . . Ampol opted out of its tyre
interests by selling its 39.56 percent equity in B. F. Goodrich,
following two years’ losses.
A one-for-five bonus, two years after a one-for-four
handout, was good news for A. V. Jennings’ shareholders,
although the rate of profit growth was not so
dramatic this last year . . . PGH reports a
slightly better profit, but dividend is down from 14
to 12 l-3rd percent . . . Major user of copper
John Mcllwraith has bought a half-interest in a Mt, Lofty
copper mine; profit rose 16 percent to $1.6 million . . .
A one-for-five premium issue is forthcoming from
Australian Controls, whose profits climbed for the
ninth successive year to $535,000.
Associated Portland Cement joins its competitor
in a lower profit for the June half . . . Farley and Lewers
doubled profit and dividend was higher than forecast.
Over in the west, Chamberlain hiked earning rate to
46 percent, with 37 percent better profit . . .
Malcolm Moore’s profit was fractionally lower . . . Lower
profits were also reported by Gilbert Lodge and
Industrial Engineering, the latter whittling dividend from
12 to 10 percent . . . J. Blackwood earned record profit,
to show an earning rate of 36.4 percent.
Sebels announced a one-for-eight bonus, after record
sales and profits for the June half, and should
maintain dividend . . . Carpet Manufacturers just failed
to equal its 1959-60 record result with a $410,000 profit.
The rural outlook for the moment is more
promising than for some years, according to
Winchcombe Carson, which announced slightly lower profits
. . . Younghusband’s dividend was slashed from 12 to
eight percent when profit fell by 66 percent.
Overseas interests plan to make a multi-million-dollar
bid for R. W. Miller’s hotel and liquor holdings . . .
Higher tax held Penfolds Wines’ profit at only marginally
better than for 1967 . . . Joe White Maltings earned less
... so did Millaquin Sugar, but the dividend was
safe in both cases.
Jordan Chemicals lifted profit and earning rate
soared to 30.8 percent . . . W. C. Penfold restored the
10 percent dividend rate on a better 1968 performance.
CRA more than doubled its estimated copper and gold
reserves at Bougainville to 500 million tons for
open-cut mining, and around the ore body may be
another 400 million tons of lower grade; present thinking
is for production of 120,000 tons of copper concentrate
a year, and capital expenditure of $250 million . . .
Mt. Isa’s copper grade improved in August . . . Mt. Lyell
lifted estimated reserves times in the past year
to 42 million tons of 1.4 percent copper . . . Broken Hill
South’s issue is a one-for-four at $2 premium, to raise
$15.3 million for its Queensland phosphate project.
Using its big share premium for the first time
since listing, CGFA made a SIQ million share bid for a
half-interest in King Island Scheelite.

Cost-benefit analysis for
farmers’ feather beds
HOWEVER WORTHY the rural in-
dustries are on account of their over-
whelming contribution to exports (still,
even with the rise in metals, about
four-fifths of the total) this “come to
the rescue” approach to keep them
vigorously viable would have to give
place to something more scientific in
the context of program budgeting. This
is not to say that the Government
would ever get its programming so
right that it would never have to come
to the rescue of the rural industries, or
that its programs would not provide for
their assistance on a continuing basis
in one direction or another.
Whatever its merits, program budget-
ing as espoused by Mr. Whitlam in the
Budget debate and now much in vogue
overseas —the U.S. already has it and
Britain is near to introducing it—may
have an ominous ring for the more
conservatively minded farm people and
also for those sections of the industry
which have come to expect Government
handouts by right. On the one hand,
some will ask whether this method of
budgeting, which would gauge an in-
dustry’s share of Government assist-
ance more by its long-term contribution
to national economic welfare than the
exigencies of its short-term position,
will be like letting Government planners
into their affairs by the back door;
while to others, the possibility of cost-
benefit analysts going to work on
their feather beds will hold terrors of
reduced handouts to keep their going
soft. They may well have noticed that
program budgeting in the U.S. has been
accompanied by a rather greater em-
phasis* being put on Government finan-
cial assistance on social welfare schemes
and a lot less on farm price supports.
This is no mere coincidence. It may
be much more difficult weighing the
value of pensioners’ claims than farmers’
in national priorities for assistance, but
techniques have been developed over-
seas to fit these and every other Gov-
ernment spending purpose into the pro-
gram budgeting framework.
Cost-benefit techniques are already
employed in some Government depart-
ments here also, but what is missing at
the moment is a national synthesis of
the results in which expenditure on the
margin in one direction is weighed
against marginal expenditure in all the
others. But as well as that gap in
national accounting there’s virtually no
long-term planning at the national level
to determine, right or wrong, that value
rating to attribute to an incremental
increase in expenditure for this and
that purpose in the longer-term sets of
Whitlam ... program budgeteer
objectives (longer, that is, than the
single year of one Budget).
When, as recently, the Federal Gov-
ernment states it is looking closely at
the rural industries, this is the sort of
examination it should be undertaking.
But only in the case of the dairying
industry does it seem to have done so
to the point of making judgments about
the relative level of national resources
that should be devoted to it, and came
up with the answer that there must
be a scaling-down, which ultimately
could mean a big reduction in price
supports (and consumer subsidies)
for the industry. As it was largely only
the danger of the British market for
our dairying exports being eroded in
the event of Britain going into the
Common Market that got the. Govern-
ment going on dairying, similar search-
ing examination of the fruit industry
(fresh, canned, and dried) might have
brought similar results though not, of
course, in time to save that industry the
painful consequences of sterling de-
valuation, though certainly in good time
to get it properly pruned before Britain
does go in.
As it would entail deep examination
of the prospects for overseas marketing
for the various industries with claims
for Government assistance, program
budgeting could be expected to throw
up danger signals about the level of
resources being applied to them under
present budgeting arrangements. Indus-
tries are too prone to catch the
Treasurer unawares with their claims
for financial assistance, such as this year
when handouts to farmers jumped by
25 percent to $179 million.
The basic weakness is that the Gov-
ernment’s overall encouragement to the
expansion of rural production (not only
through financial and general economic
means but also through the CSIRO
and other research activities), however
circumspect it may be in underwriting
stabilisation schemes and so forth, is
always being caught for ad hoc hand-
outs which might well be avoided if it
undertook more research into marketing
problems and prospects on its own
account and geared its financial
encouragement to rural industries in the
light of the results.
The certain thing is that program
budgeting would entail a greater degree
of Government inquiry into rural and
all other industries receiving assistance
or wanting assistance from the Federal
Government. The trouble with that is
not, in fact, that the Government may
say that it is entitled to know what the
handouts are for, and why they are
necessary, and to inquire whether they
could be avoided if different policies
and courses were adopted; it is simply
that a great many people in the rural
industry don’t want to have their affairs
planned by governments.
AGRISEARCH
EXTENSION IN THE WEST
IF ANY FURTHER proof was needed
of the efficacy of agricultural extension
in raising the profitability of farming
it has now come convincingly from the
West. Farmers retaining agricultural
consultants have increased their net in-
come by more than twice that of neigh-
bors who did not seek professional ad-
vice. This has happened in a mixed
farming district, predominantly dairy-
ing, south of Perth. In an entirely
different farming area, in the sheep-
wheat zone north-east of Perth, this
story has been repeated, though with
somewhat less dramatic results. Here
the increase has been of the order of
40 percent, but, as time goes by, the
farmers using management advisers in
this district could draw the greater
benefits. The pay-off on improved farm-
ing methods naturally takes longer
where the conditions are more dif-
ficult. Besides, the idea of using private
farm advisers has been practised longer
in the dairying district than in the
wheat district.
Western Australian farmers were the
first in this country to introduce the
“farm club” system from New Zealand.
The movement started about eight years
ago. A club consists of up to 50 farmers
who combine to contribute the salary of
an agricultural extension officer who
then devotes his knowledge and time
solely to that group of farmers. More
recently the clubs have tended to dis-
band and be replaced by freelance,
private consultants, as farmers have be-
come accustomed to the idea of paying
for discreet pieces of professional agri-
cultural advice in much the same spirit
as they meet the doctor’s or lawyer’s
fee. The private consultant system is
less cumbersome than the clubs and,
among other advantages, lets closer and
better-informed relations develop be-

tween the adviser and his client.
Currently, about 55 consultants are
operating in Western Australia. Their
intensive advice, which tends to em-
phasise the business side of farming
rather than the technical aspects, is be-
ing eagerly sought by almost 2000
farmers. Scarcity of properly trained
and experienced consultants is now the
limiting factor.
Private agricultural consultants are
becoming more common in the eastern
States, also. Ideally, the consulting
system should complement government-
run agricultural extension services
which would concentrate on raising the
general level of agricultural education,
assembling and disseminating pertinent
technical information, and calculating
the broad economic consequences of
the adoption of new methods and
management systems. Such services
would prepare farmers to make better
use of the individual advice purveyed
by the consultants. These, in turn,
would have less difficulty in gaining
access to new knowledge of economic
significance.
The above measures of the effective-
ness of professional advice were ascer-
tained by Mr. F. J. Southcombe, a
Research Fellow in Agricultural
Economics at the University of Western
Australia. He compared the farming
performances of 60 .members of 13
advisory groups with an equal number
of non-members operating similar
farms nearby. His analysis of the
farmers’ achievements in each group
covered identical periods which ranged
from four to eight years. He admits
that, to begin with, those farmers who
clubbed together to seek professional
advice usually owned slightly larger
farms than the “go-it-alone” farmers.
Likewise club members at the outset
had more livestock, more acres of
improved pasture, and used more family
labor or employed more outside labor
than the farmers who never joined
advisory groups. However, these dif-
ferences were fairly small, but as the
years have gone on they have increased
markedly. Generally, those farmers who
joined advisory clubs have bought more
land, developed more land, added
more stock, and worked harder or em-
ployed more labor than the other
farmers. As a result, the net worth of
club members showed substantially
greater increases which were of the
order of $20,000 per farm in the dairy-
ing district and $22,000 in the wheat
district.
Mr. Southcombe noted that both
club members and non-members in
both regions had roughly similar pat-
terns of expenditure, although members
were devoting greater outlays on labor,
seed, fertiliser, and stock. And, of
course, their interest bills were bigger.
Mr. Southcombe concluded that
“greater emphasis on productive ex-
penditure and more effective deploy-
ment of long- and short-term credit
permitted the users of farm manage-
ment advice to operate more profitably
and to expand faster over the same
period” than their neighbors who did
not seek professional advice.

WHICH WAY WILL
SHARE PRICES
START TO REACT?
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
THE GOOD results are pouring out,
with bonus issues spattered around
(Jennings, Piet, Steel Mills and Bell
Bros, last week) along with plenty of
higher dividends, despite the increased
company tax. Not even the occasional
lower results, like Hiltons or Federal
Hotels or Cresco Fertilisers or Soft-
wood or Industrial Engineering or
APCM, can offset the general impres-
sion that profits are up and are likely
to continue to rise for most companies
although it is true that there is a
long and growing list of companies
that did no better than hold their own
last year, like Queensland Cement,
Millaquin Sugar, Winchcombe Carson,
and Electrical Equipment.
But just look at the impressive im-
provements from Bradmill, Associated
Pulp, Chamberlain, J. Blackwood,
Farley and Lewers, John Mcllwraith,
and PGH that were reported last week
alone. Nevertheless, the stockmarket is
not responding at all; last week the in-
vestment section of the Sydney share
price index eased back one point (due
mainly to BHP’s 40-cent fall) and there
is mounting expert opinion that invest-
ment shares could be in for some reac-
tion to the rises over recent months
that have now tapered off. This is
despite the widespread evidence that
many speculators in the mining market
have been taking at least part of their
profits and looking for alternative in-
vestments—including industrial shares.
But t^iere a l ot this money going
right out of the market, too, as many
profit-takers on the stock exchange are
no doubt contributing to the rapid rises
* n values in “desirable” suburbs
that ave mar^e d recent times. And
on a lower level, the upsurge in motor
vehicle registrations and particularly
Holden’s success with its snappy and
more expensive Monaro could well
be partly due to the spending of min-
ing profits. Not that there is heavy
selling in the mining post, but it is con-
sistent. And no matter how good pros-
pects may be, it is difficult not to see
the merit of an investor cashing in on
at least part of his profits after the
big rises of the past couple of years.
So what is the market going to do?
In a technically oriented look at share
prices, the Sydney broking firm of Fleck-
noe and Osborne takes the view in a
circular to clients that the investment
market will ease slightly over the next
six weeks. Its main reasons are techni-
cal ones. The share price index has
moved well ahead of its six-month mov-
ing average and this usually is followed
by a short-term reaction. “Share prices
have simply risen too rapidly and some
profit-taking must occur before the rise
can be resumed. At the end of July,
most industry indexes reflected an over-
bought position in industrials.”
The firm supports its view by noting
that since the end of March there have
been few days when the number of
shares that rose was below those that
fell, a nd says that four and a half
months is a long time for such a succes-
sion of rises to be sustained without
some sort of reaction,
If such a fall were to take place, it
would simply follow the frequently seen
pattern of share prices falling on good
news; it is now well established that
good company results cannot hold up a
market that wants to fall.
But the firm says, “We would not be
looking for a severe shakeout, such as
occurs from time to time in mining
stocks, but rather a mild setback in the
order of 5 to 10 percent. Investors
appear to have little to lose by waiting
for a month before purchasing indus-
trials. We would expect the market to
resume its upward movement by the
beginning of October, 1968.”
And then it expects the investment
market to rise by at least 10 percent
from current levels by next March,
when investors would be pricing in-
dustrials at about 18 times 1968-69
earnings.
For mining, the broking firm sees a
brighter short-term future than for in-
dustrials. “The immediate outlook is
for another upswing in mining and oil
stocks as indicated by the fact that most
stocks have reacted by at least two-
thirds of their March-June rise, and by
their breaking of intermediate down-
trends. The reaction of July-August has
been the most drawn-out of the four
setbacks over the past year. We believe
that a recovery is already under way.
If there is an easing in industrial share
prices it would seem likely that funds
could flow back into mining and oil
stocks, many of which are well below
their highs for 1968. Those stocks which
have shown the greatest strength during
the last reaction are likely to be the
best performers in the next upswing.”
And longer term: “We do not sub-
scribe to the theory that when this bull
market ends, the mining stocks will fall
at much the same rate as they have
risen. Rather, we anticipate that over
the next 12 months many stocks will
move out of their steep upward trend
channels into price plateaus within
which they will fluctuate quite widely.
Two or three years hence it is inevitable
that anticipation of earnings in 1968-69
will prove to have been too optimistic
for some companies and their share
prices will suffer, but for others the
reverse will undoubtedly hold true. It
is far too early to say that present prices
overvalue prospects.”
Another important point the broking
THE CHARTIST SAYS: g. j. COLES hardly evokes the words “spec-
tacular” or “growth” when looking at a chart on its price movements since 1960.
The best rate of appreciation was a 40 percent uptrend in 1963, until the general
“topping” of the retail group. Prices fell gradually to the 1960 support level and
a low of $1.05. An uptrend at a rate of approximately 100 percent has been
established over the past few months, the base consolidation has “bullish” implica-
tions, and there is a target ahead of at least $2. A broad analysis of the overall
trend since 1960 suggests that if prices are able to move above the 1964 top the
stock could be reassessed in terms of a possible new growth phase. Last sale price
on 29/8/68, $1.36.


firm makes is that 80 percent of the
total capitalisation of the Sydney Stock
Exchange is accounted for by only 112
companies, and that the 12 largest
mining companies (including BHP)
listed in Sydney make up almost half
its capitalisation, indicating that, for
most investors what happens to these
leading companies is of major signifi-
cance.
One major question mark over
Flecknoe and Osborne’s analysis is dem-
onstrated by the quite different view of
prospects taken last week by another
technical analyst, the Cowan service.
And this is on the matter of the
market’s reaction to the recent up-
swings. Flecknoe and Osborne split the
market into two distinct areas, in-
dustrial and mining, each with its
separate trends. The Cowan service
takes a view over the market as a whole
and says: “After a huge upsurge in
share prices, such as Australia has ex-
perienced in the past 15 months, it is
inevitable that a technical reaction
and probably a reaction of some con-
sequence must occur.”
As far as Cowan is concerned, that
reaction has not happened yet for the
market as a whole; for Flecknoe’s it has
already taken place in mining but is
ahead of us in industrials. And Cowan
takes the gloomy view that if Aus-
tralia’s overseas reserves are cut almost
in half by June next year, as the Mel-
bourne University’s Institute of Applied
Economic Research suggests, then
“there is little hope of any increase in
share prices during the remainder of
1968-69.” For Cowan asserts there is a
relationship between the level of over-
seas funds and share prices.
Frankly, the Cowan analysis looks
very unlikely indeed; if there is any
relationship between these two factors,
it is that share price moves anticipate
moves in reserves, rather than the other
way around. The moral that Cowan
should be drawing from the present
situation, in which reserves are falling
and share prices rising, is that reserves
will soon follow the market’s lead and
rise.
But to be fair to Cowan, the service
does insist that “We don’t want you to
construe this as a panic-selling message.
It is nothing of the sort. We now
recommend that you should convert a
very modest proportion of your mining
stocks (but not Peko, Great Boulder,
North Kalgurli, Loloma, or Mt. Isa)
into cash and place the proceeds on
deposit at call for the time being. This
will serve to preserve portion of the
very large profits which you have
derived in the past year and afford
some degree of protection against any
significant turnaround.”
But despite the threat of a reaction
that obviously worries the Cowan ser-
vice, it is still confident about some
leading stocks, particularly BHP, which
it “strongly recommended” last week
to clients at prices around $22. It fore-
cast that by 1970-71, BHP’s earnings
per share should be of the order of 80
to 90 cents compared with the latest
year’s 36 cents, with oil contributing 35
cents, Mt. Newman iron ore another
six cents, steel about 46 cents, and man-
ganese about two cents. And earnings
from all of these should rise consider-
ably more in subsequent years.
TEXTILES
MORE TOGETHERNESS?
SINCE Viyella’s bid for Davies Coop
was successfully resisted a couple of
years ago, nobody has seemed all that
keen to further the cause of integration
in Australia’s fragmented textile in-
dustry, at least with the fervor seen in
Britain and some overseas countries.
Dunlop’s successful bid for Prestige
may, however, open a new chapter in
the story, though in what particular
direction remains to be seen.
The hosiery business seems to be one
area where further rationalising could
take place now that Dunlop-Holeproof-
Prestige presents such a strong front.
When that bid was made, there were at
least two companies in Melbourne,
Hilton Corporation and Beau Monde,
whose shares were pretty well at rock
bottom, seemingly crying out for close
attention from takeover merchants both
on the score of the yields they were
offering and, at least in the case of
Hilton, on the score of net tangible
assets.
Of course, as the setback announced
by Hilton Corporation last week
emphasises only too well, a bidder for
that company on the score of its hosiery
potential would have to ask himself
what he would do with all the appen-
dages to the hosiery side of the business,
most of which look a drag on general
profitability with some of them
highly vulnerable to the vagaries of
women’s fashions. For although Hilton
sales rose 8 percent overall last
year, profits slumped miserably and the
earnings rate was more than halved
from the previous year’s 38.6 percent
to 18.3, leaving only marginal cover for
the dividend of 15 percent, a rate pre-
viously well covered for several years.
One of the first questions a takeover
man would have to ask is how much
of the group’s substantial net assets are
represented by the hosiery side and
how much by the less profitable yarn
processing and by women’s clothing.
Nobody is claiming, however, that
even when uncluttered by various other
textiles activities, hosiery is necessarily
attractive as an investment, although
Sydney’s Kolotex has done wonderfully
well. Hilton’s record in that direction
is pretty good, of course, but nobody
could say this for Beau Monde, whose
performance has been somewhat fitful
in recent years, at least before the
arrival of Mr. Harry Anderson on the
scene.
It is easy enough to say that, under
expert management, Beau Monde has
proved that given favorable conditions
in the trade (and they were favorable
last year with the new applications of
“stretch” techniques in stockings and
the fast upward trend in “pantie” hose)
it is possible that the pure and simple
hosiery business, such as Beau Monde,
uncluttered by supernumeries, could be
a winner. However, in the mild rush
for both Hilton and Beau Monde when
they were both showing yields in the
region of 10 percent last week, the
price of Beau Monde shares looked
rather like getting out of a bidder’s
reach, as indeed did those of Hilton
before it announced its dismal result at
the end of the week.
TRANSPORTERS
A TIME FOR LINKAGES
THE TRANSPORT industry has been
one of the most rumor-prone for take-
overs of all in recent years, and the
coming of the containerisation era has
stepped up the speculations about new
alignments. Already there are the
significant links between Mayne Nick-
less and P & O and the TNT-Alltrans-
Cargo Distributors alliance with Trans-
port Development. Last week’s rumor,
of a possible link between highly
diversified Brambles Industries and
F. H. Stephens, the third-largest inter-
state road haulier with a very large
forwarding and shipping operation,
could make a great deal of sense.
A joint operation, with appropriate
shipping associations, could provide the
economies of scale that will be vital
in meeting the demands of the con-
tainer age and the strong competi-
tion of rivals. There is no doubt that
the business is really lively; last month,
for instance, Mayne Nickless started up
its own chartered air-freight service,
offering overnight delivery between
Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane by
using a chartered Bristol freighter.
The industry is also full of diver-
sionary moves in some sort of example
of its restless nature. Last week, TNT
incorporated in Sydney a million-dollar
company, Barrier Reef Cruises, with
the stated objects of running tours and
tourist activities in the Barrier Reef
and elsewhere. Barrier Reef Cruises Pty.
Ltd. is envisaged as a 100 percent TNT
venture, and the company is thinking in
terms of a 1500-ton boat, possibly built
locally, for luxury cruising within the
reef.

that state of affairs on other countries,
while shovelling the excesses of the
Australian industry on to the free
world market (1.37 million tons last
year) and depressing world prices still
further.
Such excesses, it had generally been
supposed, were the results of an
irresponsible and short-sighted Govern-
ment policy which had encouraged a
large expansion of the industry in the
face of world over-production.
But no: last week, with sugar hit-
ting a new low point for the year of
£17.5 a ton and this month’s longed-
for sugar pact meeting in Geneva
seemingly in danger of collapse before
it even starts, Mr. McEwen explained
to Federal Parliament that the Govern-
ment’s expansive sugar policy was
aimed at winning a bigger export quota
for Australia from future international
sugar agreements. Mr. McEwen said
that Australia’s quota under a future
agreement would be higher than those
operating in the past. But he would not
be drawn on the price that has had to
be paid.
Despite the sickening price slump
for which accusing fingers point only
too readily at Australia, most sources in
London believe that things must in-
evitably get worse yet. They see no
buying power left before the first quar-
ter of 1969 and the European beet
harvest has not yet been brought in.
With so much surplus sugar hanging
around, those buyers who have not
already bought some of next year’s
needs (many believed that things just
could not get as bad as they are now)
are likely to hold out for lower and
lower prices.
And even if the negotiations in
Geneva can survive the political up-
heavals of Czechoslovakia (some nego-
tiators could well give the cold-
shoulder to members of the Warsaw
Pact countries in general and so wreck
any hopes of a viable agreement), it
might end up a hollow sort of affair,
in the short-term, anyway. The Lon-
don market points out that whatever
the agreement there would be a rush to
unload surpluses at depressed prices
during the last months of 1968 —which
is what the buyers are waiting for
and by „the time producers were ready
to start selling under the new agree-
ment there would be no buyers left.
Whether a new agreement will
present Australia with bigger quotas
than before or not does not alter the
fact that the industry here will have to
cut back its production. But Mr.
McEwen would not be drawn on this
point and in answer said that he had
no intention of revealing at this stage
what Australia’s bargaining position
would be in future international sugar
negotiations. But if Australia is pre-
pared to accept the initial suggestions at
Geneva and under the present
worsening conditions it seems even more
likely that it will then a 28 percent
cut in sugar exports to the free market
would mean cutting the estimated
2,565,000 tons of this year’s raw sugar
harvest by 300,000 tons in future.
What in fact the Government has
attempted to gain by helping to throw
the world’s sugar markets into its
present chaos through over-production
has largely been lost in the same
manoeuvre. Despite the increased pro-
duction over the past two or three
years, export earnings have remained
stagnant around the $lO5 million mark
compared with the earlier $l4O million
levels. Should a successful agreement
be reached at Geneva and the price of
sugar be raised to an optimistic £32
a ton, the value of Australia’s exports
would rise despite the cut in volume to
the free market, but only by about
$9 million, and only after the painful
cuts in home production have been
made; while the home market goes on
supporting the industry through ex-
cessively high domestic price guaran-
tees. The Government’s sugar policy
looks as if it has turned out just as
shortsighted and ineffective as it was
always thought to be.
Behind the
balance sheets
CAN WILLIAM ADAMS
PLUCK SOME
FRUITS OF EXPANSION?
WILLIAM ADAMS & CO. has been
“about” to do a lot better for some
years now. But there has always been
some reason why the fruits of its major
expansion program o.ver the past ten
years have not yet been reaped. Last
year there was the drought, the year
before the tractor division did not come
up to scjatch, and so it goes on, with the
result that the latest pre-tax profit is
still $182,000 below that of 1965, earn-
ing rate has been cut almost in half,
and the dividend has remained for the
past three years at percent instead
of 1965’s 15 percent.
But all this is not to say that William
Adams, Australia’s biggest steel mer-
chant and one of its leading distribu-
tors of tractors, aluminium, machine
tools, engineering equipment, and in-
dustrial products, is a stock with no
prospects. Far from it. The current
financial year should see the beginnings
of a period of significant profit im-
provement as improved economic con-
ditions (particularly the absence of
drought) combine with the approach
of the end of the disruption caused by
major expansion.
Drought dried up the profit-making
capacity of William Adams for three
years, for not only does it cater directly
for primary industry, with its exclusive
Caterpillar tractor franchise in Vic-
toria and Tasmania, but manufacturing

industry is inevitably dependent to a
degree on the health of the rural sec-
tor, which probably goes part of the
way toward explaining the poor level
of investment in plant and equipment
in the past two years by the private
sector. This lagged in 1966-67 and,
according to the Treasurer in his recent
Budget speech, rose by only 2 percent
in 1967-68, or by less than the rise in
costs, anyway. And this is where Wil-
liam Adams depends for its sales.
At last month’s annual meeting, the
company’s chairman maintained that
there was a continued lack of growth
in fixed-capital expenditure by the
metal-working industries, aside from
mining. Industry in general, he said,
has not increased its rate of investment
in machine tools and other productive
items. So market conditions have not
been exactly easy. But William Adams’
upward sales trend has been uninter-
rupted since 1962, when there was a
setback with depressed economic condi-
tions. Last year’s sales increase was 4.7
percent, the best rise for three years,
and in the first quarter of the current
financial year the rise had grown to
5.2 percent.
The company’s improving profit
trend is not evident in its modest earn-
ings increase for 1967-68, which was
established before the new company tax
rates were announced. These will prob-
ably reduce the latest profit to about
the previous year’s level. Where it is
evident is in the remarkable profit im-
provement in the second half of the
last financial year that more than offset
the fall in the first half and appears to
have continued into the current 12
months. For first-half profits in 1967-68
dropped 8.7 percent and second-half
earnings jumped 16.9 percent. To some
extent this was due to the poor profit
level in the second half of the previous
year, on which the comparison was
based, but it is nevertheless impressive.
The easing down of William Adams’
expansion program should also help
profits. The last three years of lower
profits covered the period of greatest
capital expenditure, and as the major
part of this was on buildings little tax
relief was available in investment allow-
ances.
When it finishes spending about $1
million at Coopers Plains for the reloca-
tion of Brisbane offices, showroom,
and warehouse from Eagle Farm and
the city, the company will have very
modern facilities everywhere, and
adequate land for future expansion.
Management can then concentrate in
the New Year on its trading activities.

Hyster’s in the industrial-truck business,
and the outcome was that William
Adams took up the less important Tow-
motor franchise.
The tractor division in Victoria had
better results in 1967-68, and more
than made up for a decline in Tas-
mania. The engineering division was
reported as producing much the same
profit as the previous year, and the
merchandising and steel divisions sold
more, but earned less.
The drought caused power cuts in
Tasmania, circumstances it is hoped
were peculiar to last year, adversely
affecting trading as the demand from
industry was curtailed. But the company
will have to live with the other factor
adversely affecting it last year, of
higher labor costs established by the
metal trades award.
The growth of the business and the
heavy capital expenditure of $2.2 mil-
lion on buildings and $1.5 million on
new plant in the past five years has
been financed by a small private place-
ment of shares, and two issues to share-
holders, a one-for-five at 100 percent
premium in September, 1965, and a
one-for-eight at 75 percent premium in
September, 1966. The company also
borrowed $1 million on mortgage in
1965-66, repayable over 20 years
A $989,000 increase in stocks and
debtors and $593,000 net increase in
fixed assets in 1967-68 was met by
borrowing an additional $1,090,000 in
short-term loans and $312,000 from
bankers. The company is planning in-
troduction of further long-term funds
at the moment. It has announced this
does not mean a share issue. Perhaps a
“family” debenture issue might suit the
company’s needs, now that convertible
notes are no longer practicable. (The
company financed the early part of its
10-year expansion and modernisation
program with a one-for-two issue of six
percent notes in 1959, which converted
to ordinary shares in 1965, lifting the
then capital by 36 percent.)
William Adams was unexpectedly
successful with its unnamed listed in-
vestments in 1967-68, which climbed
in market value over the year from
$175,000 to $601,000, compared with
$50,000 cost.
One problem adding to costs in
recent times has been the company’s
move to electronic data processing. The
management would not hazard a guess
at the cost of running parallel systems
of accounting while a computer was
being run in. EDP was first introduced
in April, 1965, and progressively imple-
mented. All of the substantial develop-
ment costs have been written off out of
profits in the past three years. The
company is hopeful it is nearing the
point where unrecoverable costs associ-
ated with installation should be mini-
mal.
It has been a mammoth task to com-
puterise stock control, service costing,
and invoicing, and so far the tractor
company and the parent company in
N.S.W., Victoria, and Queensland are
on EDP. The computer is working three
shifts five days a week, and a larger one
will soon be necessary. The manage-
ment declares that the company has
been among the few to go over to
EDP, but the pay-off comes later. By
the early ’7os the company would not
be able to operate effectively without
it.
The current year’s results should rise
reasonably, but may not be a full indi-
cation of the company’s earnings
capacity, as the Brisbane move will not
be made until at least the end of the
calendar year. If by 1969-70 its earn-
ings have not accelerated markedly as
everything should be working for the
company, then the stock will not be
worth retaining.
At $2.25 to yield 5.6 percent on the
three-year-old dividend rate of 12£ per-
cent, and 6.9 percent on earnings, the
market is not yet convinced of William
Adams’ regenerated grow'h capacity.
But given reasonable industrial and
economic conditions, the shares look a
fair buy for the income and security-
conscious investor who might partici-
pate in a privileged debenture or note
issue in the near future.

DIFFERENT MILL FEED
TO SWEETEN
RENISON'S RECOVERY
RENISON appears to have tired of
the continued losses of revenue arising
from the difficult metallurgy of ore
taken from its newly opened-up Fed-
eral lode. Following the large issue to
shareholders in 1965, which raised
almost $6 million, the company began
developing the Federal and Basset
lodes with the object of raising output
of ore from 3000 tons a year to over
300,000 tons. Production for the year
to June reached 326,000 tons, of which
71 percent came from the Federal
lode; the remainder came from two
other underground lodes and some
open-cut deposits, but the different
types of ore fed to the mill did not
improve overall efficiency.
In 1965, before the expansion pro-
gram began, the company was able to
recover over 65 percent of the tin con-

tent of ore milled which came from
the Boulder mine. The following year,
when a small amount of Federal ore
was fed into the mill, recovery dropped
to 57.9 percent, and in 1967, when the
expansion program was half way com-
pleted, recovery fell to 44.5 percent
from the milling of ore from several
different sources. Things got worse last
year with the large increase in produc-
tion from the Federal lode and
recovery fell to 41.4 percent.
These low recoveries reduced profit
from $300,000 in 1966 to $40,000 in
1967 and culminated in last year’s
loss of $910,000. It is not surpris-
ing that directors are now taking steps
to achieve a sufficient rate of recovery
to give so'me return on the large invest-
ment made in the expansion of the
mine and plant in addition to the
$6 million raised through the share
issue, this included a loan of $2 million
from Renison’s parent company, Con-
solidated Gold Fields Australia Limited
the more so in view of the option
held by Consolidated Gold Fields to
take up 400,000 shares at $5 a share,
which expires at the end of December
this year.
The company is to sweeten up its
recovery rates by reducing the output
of ore from the Federal lode to less
than 50 percent of 'mill requirements
and using in its place the higher grade
and more tractable ore from the
Boulder mine and the newly delineated
North Stebbins lode and the Dread-
nought lode. It is a measure of the
apparent urgency of the situation that
the North Stebbins lode, from which
ore is to be taken, had not been devel-
oped by last June and ore reserves had
only been proved up to the “probable”
stage.
The improvement which can be
expected from using different mill feed
should be considerable, and an imme-
diate difference should beco'me appar-
ent in tin metal production. During
July, ore from the North Stebbins lode
was used as mill feed and the recovery
rate rose to 59.7 percent for the first
four weeks of the current financial
year. The Boulder lode ore has an
average grade of about 1.5 percent tin,
while the North Stebbins lode assays
1.39 percent tin, and these higher
grades will be an additional benefit,
quite apart from the improvement in
recovery which the easier metallurgy
of these ores will allow. Nevertheless,
the company is probably reluctant to
•gut these higher grade orebodies for
long and it is more likely that the
grade of overall mill feed will not
be greatly in excess of 1 percent tin,
if that. Even if the grade of mill feed
is similar to the 0.84 percent of the
last tw'o years, the 'maintenance of
higher recovery rates of, say, 58 per-
cent would lift the content of tin
metal in concentrates produced from
1134 tons to 1600 tons over a full year
a difference of 466 tons worth
roughly $1 million.

MANY WAYS TO
PROFIT FROM
OPTIONS...
Stock and share Options as a
minimum-risk way to profit on the
market are as firmly established
in Australia as they have been in
the United States and Europe for
the past 50 years. The usual
application is to buy Calls when
you expect a share price to rise;
Puts when you expect a fall. But
there are many other situations in
which Options provide the answer.
Here are just a few: use Calls to
free funds but protect your invest-
ment; buy a Put to make a long

ing at $864,000, this additional revenue
is important to the company. Had it
received an extra $1 million last year,
the effect would have been to change
the deficiency of $910,000 into a profit
of $lOO,OOO, which is only 3 cents per
share. As the outlook for a rise in tin
prices is anything but favorable, it is
fortunate that there is sufficient ore in
the Stebbins and Boulder lodes to
supply total mill requirements, if re-
quired, for some years. In the mean-
time, the use of ore fro'm these sources
will certainly mean a drastic improve-
ment in the company’s fortunes in the
current year.
Security analysis
DECLINE AND FALL OF
A FEUDAL FIEF
HITS PETERSVILLE
IN THE rumor market, Petersville
(Australia) Ltd. has been bought and
sold to every conceivable overseas group
imaginable, and the rumors continue.
The company itself has strongly resisted
takeover approaches in the past, and
persistently denies rumors, many of
which are made up merely for the sport
of speculation. However, my spy in
Melbourne, usually well informed,
swears to me that a takeover will defin-
itely be on this time, and, more in the
spirit of speculator than a conservative
security analyst, I plunged and bought
3000 shares on my own account.
For almost a lifetime, Petersville has
been run like a feudal fief of Emil
Christensen, who was Fred Peters’
original lieutenant for his Victorian ice-
cream operations. That was in 1930.
Mr. Christensen (now in his 70s) finally
stood down as managing director in
1967, although he continues as chair-
man, but the chief executive job is still
held in the family, and currently the
man wearing the chief executive’s hat
is the chairman’s son-in-law, J. S. Shaw
(44).
In recent years, the company’s per-
formance has been very disappointing,
and although it has kept overseas
bidders at bay, who might have been
seeking a quick and easy entrance to
the market or, alternatively, a means of
snowballing their own business here,
it is difficult to see how shareholders
have benefited. Take the growth over
the past decade. Earnings per share
grew by a measly 8 percent over the
period 1957-1967, dividends per share
by 7 percent over the same period, and
the market growth of the shares over
the decade actually fell 5 percent. Not
an inspiring show for one of Australia’s
top 100 publicly listed companies. Over
the five years 1962-1967, total assets
increased by 56 percent, yet profit for
ordinary shares declined by 10 percent.
In 1964, Mr. Christensen disclosed
that the ice-cream division accounted
for about 40 percent of group profits,
the general foods division (canned and
frozen foods) for about 30 percent,
while the pastry and dairy divisions
each contributed about percent and
the balance of the business 5 percent.
My own private research, which may
be faulty, suggests that in 1966 and
1967 the ice-cream division might have
represented only about 15 percent of
group profit compared to the general-
foods-division rating of about 55 per-
cent, milk products about 10 percent,
pies and pastry, say, another 10 percent,
with fine-foods distribution, manufac-
ture of refrigeration and display
cabinets, and miscellaneous making up
the balancing 10 percent. The main
change in the profit mix was in the
dramatic reversal of the ice-cream divi-
sion, whose profit contribution appeared
to have more than halved over a two-
to three-year period.
Ice-cream was the main stumbling
block in income performance, due to
an intense price war, which continued
through to August, 1967, but with a
negotiated peace, or possibly truce, the
industry has since settled down to more
profitable conditions. The Victorian
market is equal to about 10 million
gallons, or almost one-third of the
Australian market, while the annual
rate of growth is about 8-10 percent.
“Dessert” lines of half-gallon blocks
and trays sold to supermarkets and
chain-stores now represent about 50 per-
cent of total ice-cream sales, and im-
pulse lines (cones and wrapped deli-
cacies take the balancing 50 percent.
From selling about 60 percent of the
ice-cream in the State in former years,
iPetersville’s share is down to less than
40 percent. In the dessert lines sold to
supermarkets, Petersville’s share is down
to one-quarter to one-third, while in
impulse lines the company has about
50 percent. The major competitors are
British Tobacco, who sell under the
Toppa, Devondale, and Sunkist brands,
and Unilever with their Streets brand.
A “gentlemen’s agreement” in
August, 1967, hiked the retail price of
impulse lines —with 4c items increasing
to 5c and 8c lines now fetching 9c or
10c. Price stabilisation came as a wel-
come relief to the trade, and Petersville
would now be earning returns more
comparable with the buoyant profits
from ice-cream earned in former years.
Consolidated Milk Industries, the
N.S.W. and South Australian ice-cream
group, has reported a profit jump of
53 percent in post-tax profit this year,
and this could be a pointer to a healthy
recovery in Petersville’s own position.
The company is the largest Aus-
tralian producer of quick-frozen vege-
tables (its main brands are Birds Eye and
Hy-Peak), and one of the major pro-
ducers of canned vegetables and fruit

and Hargreaves pineapple). The rise
in the consumption of quick-frozen
vegetables in Australia has been aston-
ishing, growing from a consumption
(local production plus imports) of
2.321 b. per head of population in 1960
to 10.61 b. per head in 1967.
A few years ago, the universal method
of processing was in the use of air-
blast freezing, but a new method known
as fluidised-bed freezing has been intro-
duced, which cuts down the freezing
time from 30 minutes to five minutes.
The Petersville group is understood to
be the only major company in the
industry to retain the air-blast freezing
system, which puts them at somewhat
of a disadvantage, considering that it
is more difficult to maintain quality
with the older type of equipment.
Despite the technical handicap, Peters-
ville maintain their market leadership
in the frozen-foods stakes.
The company ranks about No. 3 or
No. 4 in the production of processed-
milk products in Victoria and has a
large export trade. Petersville’s main
interest here is in ice-cream mix,
cheese, butter, yoghurt, and casein.
The demand for casein, with Japan as
the major export market, is increasing
for use in paper-making, and as a raw
material for sodium caseinate, which is
used in preserved foods and particularly
in baby foods. In milk distribution, the
company’s sales are limited to the Vic-
torian towns of Drouin, Korumburra,
and Warragul.

The record is poor, the company has
frankly gone backwards. Still, with an
improved earning power from ice-cream
sales, the 1967-68 result is expected to
be more appetising.
SUMMARY: At 60c the shares show
a dividend yield of 4.2 percent and the
price earnings ratio is 19.2. The share
price has increased from a low of 24c
this year and currently reflects the latest
market speculation about an imminent
takeover. Current share-trading volumes
are very high. If my Melbourne spy is
right, the current share price will spell
good capital gains on a takeover, but, as
I have said before, the rumor business
is highly speculative.
Readers of this column may recall
the article on Wattyl (8., August 24)
and the point was made that 60 per-
cent of the total staff had tertiary
qualifications in chemistry, which would
put the company in a unique world
position. Accept my apology, but the
correct figure is 6 percent, not 60 per-
cent.

When achievement
is not enough
MARKING TIME IN
RUSSELL STREET
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Rehearsing “Three
Sisters” (from
left) Pat Kennedy,
Lyndell Rowe,
Dennis Olsen,
Maggie Millar,
George Whaley,
and Jennifer
Claire ... “safe
and certain”
WITH PLAYWRIGHTS like Osborne,
Wesker, and lonesco in their prime,
and Williams, Miller, and Brecht just
past theirs, the late ’fifties were vintage
years for the Union Repertory Co'm-
pany. Then based at the Melbourne
University under the direction of the
charismatic Wal Cherry, the Union
echoed to the rantings of Jimmy
Porter, and the plight of Willy
Loman, giving Melbourne theatre
perhaps the best years of its life.
Admittedly the Union’s productions
weren’t always aesthetically successful
as, pooh-poohing severe limitations of
finance and rehearsal time, Cherry
would think nothing of attempting a
work as demanding as the “Three-
penny Opera.” But his productions
were always provocative and exciting
and still linger in the memory. Unfor-
tunately, they almost always lost
money.
So, while Cherry took his dream
sequence elsewhere and struggled to
establish Theatre 60 and subsequently
Emerald Hill, John Sumner was
brought back from England to make
the Union pay its way. I found Sum-
ner’s first seasons dull and safe in
contrast with Cherry’s, but they did
the job. Innovation and experiment
were replaced with solid profession-
alism, audiences improved, and the
company consolidated.
Now, renamed the Melbourne
Theatre Company, in permanent resi-
dence in a Russell Street theatre trans-
formed by Robin Boyd, promoted by
Harry M. Miller, and subsidised by
the Theatre Trust and City Council
as well as the University, the company
is mature, successful, and admired.
The actors work as a true ensemble,
free of the anachronistic concept of
“itars.” In Richard Prins and Kristian
Fredrikson the company has two
designers of far more originality and
talent than those over-praised window-
dressers, Messrs Rowell and Truscott.
And the MTC’s George Ogilvie is an
extraordinarily intelligent and sensitive
producer.
But there are still problems and
inadequacies. Despite multiple sub-
sidies the company can be financially
embarrassed by notable but unpopular
productions like “Burke’s Company,”
while, ironically, the theatre is too small
to capitalise on box-office successes.
Perhaps because of this lingering fin-
ancial insecurity, or in the hope of
being all things to all people, the
company modulates its seasons with
more than its quota of safe or trivial
plays. Granted, we’ve seen excellent
productions of “The Knack,” “The
Representative,” and various Albee
plays. But what on earth possesses the
theatre to stage plays like “The
Magistrate”?
As well, I find their policy, or lack
of policy, regarding Australian plays
a major disappointment. This is the
company that discovered Lawler, yet
recently local drama has virtually dis-
appeared from the stage. Some years
ago the MTC produced two grating
co'medies by Alan Hopgood (“The
Big Men Fly” and “The Golden
Legion of Cleaning Women”), followed
by the same author’s sad attempt at a
work of significance in “Private Yuk
Objects.” David Martin’s “The Young
Wife” and Bill Reed’s “Burke’s Com-
pany” have been the only Australian
works presented since, and we’ve seen
nothing of Keneally’s, White’s, or Mil-
gate’s. The argument that no suitable
plays have been written doesn’t hold
water. For example Jack Hibberd’s
extraordinary “White With Wire
Wheels” was available and clearly de-
serving of a professional production.
Apart from being the director of the
MTC, John Sumner is the Victorian
representative of the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust. This makes him
uniquely powerful on the local scene,
so it’s regrettable he didn’t use his
influence to save Emerald Hill from
the bailiff. It would have been a
perfect auxiliary theatre for the MTC
• somewhere where more avant-garde
plays could have been given a tryout.
Ultimately such a two-theatre operation
would seem essential for the MTC to
prevent ossification of attitudes and to
provide the company and Mel-
bourne with increased stimulus. A
second stage, with low overhead costs,
would allow the presentation or at
least the acted reading of plays by
new writers, both local and overseas.
The new season, which opens on
September 9, presents Chekhov’s
“Three Sisters,” Albee’s “Everything
in the Garden,” Shaw’s “Major Bar-
bara,” and Peter Nichols’ “A Day in
the Death of Joe Egg.” On past ex-
perience we can be certain of four
good to excellent productions. But I’d
be happier with fewer certainties and
a little more experiment.
DEAD ENDS IN THE
BOOM STATE
By DON LIPSCOMBE
THE UNIQUE position of Western
Australia in economic and financial
terms, sometimes even in political
terms, is stressed continually. The State
always seems to be heading for another
set of crossroads but always eco-
nomic, financial, or political crossroads.
Where are the cultural crossroads?
What are they? Do they matter?
In the Western Australian language,,
“culture” is a slightly dirty word,
rather like “darling.” It is used only
with embarrassment, even by the group
of people claiming to be most inter-
ested in it. This group makes up the
conforming non-conformists, whose
opinions on everything from capital
punishment to Vietnam to filling in the
river are more predictable than the
answers to the same set of questions,
or any other set of questions, from the
deep leather people of the Weld Club.
This is the State on the move, giving
it a go, getting things done; there isn’t
time for culture. That may come after-
ward. But first, let’s get this State
moving.
Every professional man will see in
his own field the fruits of such an atti-
tude. Culture can be a just law as
much as a new opera company, a good
newspaper as muoh as a busy art
gallery, a fine building as much as a


significant art exhibition. And, yet, few
professional men have reason to feel
proud of Western Australia. Perth’s
most notable assets are 1000 acres of
virgin bushland, virginity increasingly
suspect, and a view over what was once
a piece of river and is now a heap of
sand.
Outstandingly willing to give it a
go in some fields, Western Australians
shun giving it a go culturally, and ridi-
cule anybody who does. So a developer
who has created a flow of money with
a flair will turn off his flair at that
point and allow conservatism to take
over. It is usually plain conservatism
and not money-hunger, for flair with
economy is rejected almost as surely
as flair with expense.
“Oh, for another Charlie Court!” is
often the cry of those who seek the
same drive in other fields as is given
to industrial development (not always
a complimentary call, implying more
consideration for people as corporate,
wealth-seeking beings than as indi-
viduals). Similarly, Western Australians
might well ask that Dr. Coombs come
home to Perth; after 18 years of being
Australian banking puppeteer, he has
taken on the job of being an Australian
cultural watchdog but from Can-
berra. Oh, even, for another Claude de
Bernales a gold-company manipu-
lator and a rogue, but at least a rogue
with a flair, one who has left land-
marks like the mock-Tudor London
Court in the heart of the city.
Certainly, one such man with drive
and vision could, at such a time, in-
spire Western Australia’s capital city
to lift its sights, and make the invest-
ment frontier of Perth an equally
exciting frontier culturally. Already
prosperity that has come in the wake
of the boom has allowed Western
Australians to think above and beyond
simply making a living a taste that
has failed to develop into an appetite
because of the leaders’ lack of aware-
ness.
Of all the aspects of culture, the one
most likely to appeal to the practical
Australian is achitecture; at least you
can see and touch it. But chances to
make a mark have been missed, creat-
ing such monuments to greyness as the
Games sporting structures at a time
when colorful thinking might have set
the norm one notch higher.
Activity and progress are not the
same. Only after the web of scaffold
falls away and ugly buildings emerge
does this become apparent. On what
used to be the beautiful boulevard of
St. George’s Terrace, buildings with
character quaint though they may
be are being replaced by buildings
without character.
The crossroad is at the other end of
Perth, the back-side of town. Western
Australia Development Corporation
(8., August 10), faces what must be
the dream of every developer the
chance to remould a whole section of
a city, and, perhaps, in doing so, start
to close the growing gap between what
Perth is and what it might have been.
SHRIVELLED HEART
THEATRE/ROBERT WARD
Burke’s Company. Bill Reed. Scott
Theatre, Adelaide.
WITH “Burke’s Company” for his first
production, the South Australian
Theatre Company’s new resident pro-
ducer, Leslie Dayman, could not have
picked or been given a more formidable
play. It is a ponderous, rambling,
overwrought work which sets out to
make high drama of the Burke and
Wills expedition by displaying the
despair, agony, and lingering deaths of
Burke and Wills on the one side and
on the other the guilt of those left
behind—especially of Brahe, who leaves
the Coopers Creek depot just nine hours
before Burke, Wills, and King arrive
back from the north.
It is a play which asks the audience
to sit through a good two and a quarter
hours of high emotionalism without re-
lief, except for an interval the play-
wright didn’t want. Apart from a faulty
structure which makes it shrivel up two-
thirds through, I think the play’s most
singular dramatic fault is its failure in
its own terms to make its characters
interesting and meaningful, to give them
language and ideas which excite the
audience and explain without cliches
the characters’ motives and manners.
Yet it must also be said that the play
is a serious attempt to express in viable
dramatic terms the actual drama of
Burke and Wills. To do this, Bill Reed
has built up a variety of incidents
central to the story, and without regard
to chronological order presents them in
a fluid, blending way that with more
discipline could be highly effective.
With its episodic form and epic con-
cerns, the play offers the producer a
vehicle for the expression more of ritual
than of realism. Thus, George Ogilvie,
when he produced it for the Melbourne
Theatre Company, used Peter Scul-
thorpe’s “Sun Music” and elements of
mime to counterpoint, heighten, or
underscore the action. Les Dayman has
also used Sculthorpe’s music, this time
his Sixth String Quartet of 1965, which
is not as effective as the “Sun Music”
would have been, and I wonder why he
did not search out a more appropriate
piece. In addition, his production
features a great variety of highly colored
back-projection slides by Ostoja-
Kotkowski.
I did not see the Melbourne produc-
tion, so I cannot comment on how it
all worked. With the current produc-
tion, however, it seems to me that noth-
ing really coheres sufficiently. The
mime is a minor element, nowhere near
as elaborate as I understand it was in
the Ogilvie production. On the acting
level, there is a really magnificent per-
formance of Burke by John Dick,
haggard, powerful, slightly crazed, de-
serving of far better lines than the play
provides. Jonathan Leigh’s Wills is
gentle and intelligent, and Paul Karo’s
King is young, earnest, and sensitive, so
that to this point the play works very
well indeed. The three performances
are the best I have seen by these actors.
'But after that everything falls away.
John Gaden’s Brahe is unsubtle, giving
entirely the wrong pitch to his lines.
Where there should be enormous tension
and reserve, there is only a wearying
outcry. In the design, there is a crude
mock-realism in a painted tree bole
and stage-cloth rocks which jars with
the highly abstract back-projected
images. The images themselves are so
striking and variable that they often
become more interesting than the action
itself, and thus defeat their purpose. In
the final analysis, then, it is an
ambitious but unsuccessful production,
lacking pace, solidity, and the general
polish one should expect from what is,
after all, styled a professional company.

Reinhard in his Sydney studio.
“mentally and physically artistically
drained”
THE art of Ken Reinhard compels the
eye, provokes the senses. It is arresting,
bewildering, amusing, and so aggres-
sively non-conforming that it is almost
impossible to label it. Since he stopped
painting conventional two-dimensional
abstracts on canvas five years ago, Rein-
hard has used timber, plastic, and
aluminium to create “structures” on
which he paints symbols in clean, vivid
colors. His latest exhibition of con-
structions—at the Bonython Gallery in
Sydney is described as a “sensory
adventure,” and is by far his
most unconventionally ambitious show.
One exhibit, Environmachine, is Bft.
high, contains a film projector which
screens continuous colored images of a
nude woman, makes “gay noises,” and
has a device that sprays perfume over
its viewers. Whoever buys it (for $2700)
will have a genuine piece of plug-in,
turn-on sensory art. Reinhard, 32,
teaches design at East Sydney Technical
College; says that the preparation of
his exhibition has left him “mentally
and physically artistically drained.”

AT LEAST five months before the
1969 Trust Opera Season is due to
begin, the first of the productions for
the new program is almost ready for
performance. Since the beginning of
August preparations have been under-
way at the Elizabethan Trust’s head-
quarters in Sydney for the staging of
Ermanno Wolfe-Ferrari’s “School for
Fathers,” a comic opera which has not
been produced anywhere for years and
never before in Australia. The Trust
will give the opera its Australian pre-
miere in Tasmania —the State in which
Australian professional opera had its
beginnings in 1842. After a three-
night stand at the National Theatre
in Launceston (beginning on September
19), the opera will have four per-
formances in Hobart’s Theatre Royal
and then be “stored” in readiness for
the start of the mainland season next
February.
Desmond Digby’s costumes and
Friedrich Bliem’s sets are to be
shipped to Tasmania; ten of the com-
pany’s principal singers fly to Launces-
ton next week for final rehearsals with
the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra.
Stephan Beinl is the producer, William
Reid the musical director.
“School for Fathers” is set in Venice,
and is about a young couple whose
scheming mothers cleverly defeat their
husbands’ attempts to keep the couple
apart. The Bulletin opera critic, John
Cargher, has described it as “a welcome
piece of uninhibited slapstick.”

ALIVE AND KICKING
ART/ELWYN LYNN
The Field. National Art Gallery of Vic-
toria.
THE FIELD, with 40 artists and 74
works, brings before a public that will
be entranced, bewildered, or plainly
hostile a movement of flat-patterned
abstraction that has more talented and
intellectually alert adherents than any
other in Australia this century.
Although the movement is several years
old elsewhere, local commentators, who
have turned the new gallery into a wail-
ing wall, have pronounced the exhibi-
tion premature, have condemned it as
“large-scale imitations of American
geometrical, hard-edge abstraction”
(Alan McCulloch), and would have
preferred a survey of the past 25 years
(Laurie Thomas) a retardataire ploy
for resurrecting some artistic derelicts.
The wonder is that Mr. Stringer (ex-
hibitions officer) and Mr. Finemore
(curator of Australian art) managed to
enshrine momentarily such an alive and
kicking movement.
It is not only the prestigious occasion
but also the momentous catalogue that
must distress the opponents of the New
Abstraction: it sells at $1.50, has 16
colorplates, has every work illustrated
(except Robert Hunter’s, whose close
tonality defies reproduction once you
haven’t seen a Hunter you haven’t seen
them all), and, in the manner of the
Two Decades of American Painting
catalogue, has essays by Royston Har-
pur, Patrick McCaughey, and myself.
People are suspicious of the New
Abstraction because it looks easy,
though it is not as easy as a Drysdale
drawing, and is much cheaper; people
think it looks the same (it doesn’t),
but don’t object to the periods when
Braque and Picasso and Pissarro and
Cezanne were almost indistinguishable;
people think it so international as to be
anti-Australian such as, for example,
Bunny, Rose, Rapotec, Klippel, French,
and Kemp. Anyone with a modicum of
perspicacity could hardly suggest that
Ball, Partos, Leach-Jones, Hickey, or
Watkins were at best imitators and at
worst plagiarists. It seems to me that a
lot of local critics are plagiarising their
fellows’ maledictions of Impressionism,
Fauvism, Cubism, Dada, Abstract Ex-
pressionism, and so on. Influences
there are and the ten reproductions of
recent and early overseas abstraction
alongside the articles clearly indicate
that these painters are in a tradition.
Not all are good; Clement Greenberg
said of this movement that it was the
first that had ever appeared with the
fine and the banal alongside each other,
and it is clear enough, as Royston Har-
pur too sweepingly alleges, that there
is a new formal academy. It is this
emphasis on the formal, on these paint-
ings as being about nothing but them-
selves that seems to me to run counter
to what a painting is about. It strikes
me as odd to say that a painting can
be “about” one of its elements or in-
gredients like structure or color. To
say, with Greenberg, that a painting is
opaque and is not a veil to be torn aside
to reveal the truth is to deny that a
painting can symbolise the life of the
feelings. No formal analysis can ex-
plain why James Doolin, who has the
toughest of surfaces, can achieve such
tension with bands of sweet pastel, why
Robert Jacks’ five red oblongs separated
by pastel prisms can produce such
Matissian serenity, why Michael John-
son’s great velvety brown area can sud-
denly look like an upholstered guillo-
tine, or why, in McGillick’s Arbitrator,
the modular arrangement can bring the
shapes into a spatial colloquy.
Just as the old masters upstairs de-
mand that you read the flashes of light
on cloth in relation to soft, peachy
flesh, painters like Hickey, who deals
with a series of similar illusions, and
Vickers, who arranges areas in diminish-
Wendy Paramor’s galvanised iron
“Luke” (1967), in The Field exhibition
ing or increasing sequence, are asking
you to revise your notions of how to
read the clues; it hardly seems en-
lightening to say that the clues are clues
to themselves. Such works are about
how we read other works just as Partos’
actual hole in his painting is a com-
ment on Gauguin’s piece of academi-
cism that no painting can have a hole in
it, meaning that vista should not sug-
gest the illusion of eternal depth. A
Schlicht is, in a sense, about rehabili-
tating the shapes of the ’twenties, and
a Watkins about intensifying the shallow
depth of an earlier Leger. Janet Daw-
son, John Peart, and Robert Hunter
seek to record the fugitive and fleeting,
the almost imperceptible shifts of al-
most identically colored volumes in an
art where much is suggestion and im-
plication as it is with Ball’s deceptively
urbane Ispahan and in Treweeke’s
repetition of machine-screened nudes.
There are others like Jordan, Aspden,
Oldfield, Lendon, Paramor, White, and
Rooney who are variously concerned
with expanding areas, climactic
accumulations of bands and rectangles,
and a crescendo of repetitions, all of
which indicate the diversity within the
movement. The intricate, ecstatic mazes
of Leach-Jones could hardly be more
different from the easy-flowing volumes
in a Christmann or a Noritas. And
would it matter if they were similar?
Upstairs are Roberts, Nerli, Condor, and
Streeton, who seem at one stage to have
shared the same personality, and if the
runners in The Field seem to cool it
overmuch it is a result of their reaction
against what Dale Hickey calls the
narcissistic self-indulgence of their
immediate predecessors, the abstract-
expressionists. Further, however pre-
conceptualised they may look, intuition
plays its part just as it does in an
architect’s spatial deployment. This
splendid exhibition records a movement,
but is not necessarily a signpost to the
future.
SAVED FROM SLEEP
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
A CONCERT featuring one of the
truly great pianists in the world would
seem to be enough in itself to engender
an atmosphere of excitement; but in the
seventh Red Series concert at the Syd-
ney Town Hall, with Claudio Arrau
as soloist, the evening’s offerings were
hardly electrifying.
Webern’s Opus 1, Passacaglia for
Orchestra, which began the program,
created an atmosphere which lasted for
the whole of the first half. A passa-
caglia, by its very nature, has an in-
exorable quality and this embryo
Webern has all the reticence of his later
works without their chiselled economy.
Despite many deft touches, the whole
effect was somewhat soporific. Pre-
dictably, the audience could barely sus-
tain its applause until the conductor,
Ferdinand Leitner, got off the platform;
but overseas conductors should be
warned that this is the standard recep-
tion by grown-up concertgoers for most
works written after 1900.
Beethoven’s “Pastoral Symphony,”
which came next, received the gentlest
reading I can ever remember having
heard. Not until that übiquitous bird
made its appearance did one realise
that here was the last cuckoo in autumn.
Also, the advent of the storm would
have hardly stirred picnickers into
covering their sandwiches. No doubt
this is a legitimate approach, but,
coupled with tempos which appeared to
be considerably slower than usual, the
result lacked vitality, a component
which is an intrinsic part of all the ex-
tended works Beethoven wrote. How-
ever, the performance did reveal the
quality of the Sydney Orchestra’s
woodwind choir, for their phrasing and
ensemble were immaculate.
From the opening horn solo to the
burst of sunshine, which is the last
movement, the Second Concerto of


Claudio Arrau... unrestrained life among the sogginess
Brahms was full of interest. Claudio
Arrau’s contribution was more than
piano-playing; it was an individual
musical conception. While the fulsome
romantic treatment given to some
phrases may have disconcerted a few
purists, there was no denying the auth-
ority of the soloist. Arrau’s prodigious
technical equipment allows him to in-
dulge all his musical ideas in a com-
pletely unrestrained fashion, yet the
whole performance tended more to-
ward the contemplative than to the
flamboyant despite the moments of
lusciousness; for there were no overt
essays in bedazzlement.
After a rather soggy start, the orches-
tra performed splendidly, with some ex-
cellent playing in the lower horn solo.
But by far the loveliest sound of the
night was Lois Simpson’s cello solo in
the slow movement, the opening of
which was sheer beauty, a fact charm-
ingly acknowledged by Mr. Arrau and
the conductor.
Autumnal elements both intrinsic and
contrived also prevailed during much
of the Bath Festival Ensemble’s second
concert for the Musica Viva at the
Town Hall. Mozart’s E Flat Trio for
clarinet, viola, and piano is probably
the most introspective of his trios, and
its seasonal affiliation is almost pre-
scribed by the nostalgia which is in-
herent in the instrumental character of
both viola and clarinet. The players,
Thea King, clarinet, Walter Gerhardt,
viola, and Joel Ryce, piano, allowed the
work to flow gently and also brought
uncommon stature to the Minuet.
After Lennox Berkeley’s String Trio,
a product of consummate craftsman-
ship which received a sensitive and
accurate performance, and Bartok’s
“Contrasts,” which were almost refined
into affinities, came the A Major Piano
Quartet of Brahms. He?e again was
an interpretation which fell far below
flashpoint but was at the same time
a perfectly legitimate reading; for often
an abundance of ebullience in the
approach to this work can turn it into
a romp, which was certainly, not what
Brahms intended.
The work of the Bath Ensemble has
tended to be overcivilised and nothing
they have done has been really memor-
able. It has been rewarding music-
making at a high level but certainly
no higher than the level our local
players could reach, given the right con-
ditions and incentive.
ONE MAN, FOUR FLAYS
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
Lunch Hour Theatre. “Q” Theatre
Group, Sydney.
Nine O’Clock Theatre. Wayside
Chapel, Sydney.
PETER O’SHAUGHNESSY is cur-
rently on stage at odd hours of the day
and night. You can see him at 1.10 p.m.
with Frank Lloyd, or at 9.00 p.m. with
Christine Bartlett. To help him in
these endeavors he has two assistant
producers, Shirley Smith and Aarne
Neeme respectively, though one won-
ders what it must be like assisting
someone who is described in a program
as “a producer and an actor; a theatri-
cal intellectual and a showman; an
actor and a manager . . . who belongs
to an honored genre of theatrical
artists which include . . . Jean Lois
(sic.), Barreau and Laurence Olivier
he is an all-rounder of the theatre.”
The plays involved could scarcely be
more different. The two Chekhov
farces at lunch-time, described as mini-
comedies and given a bit of a facelift
from the old Hoffman-Betley versions,
are still tiresome nonsense, with no real
claim to preservation but their author’s
name. The first is Saturday Evening
Post-Norman Rockwell in flavor: the
tribulations of a man whose family
is spending summer in the country. The
second, more like the “death-knell of
little Nell,” is the swansong of a 68-
year-old actor by candlelight in an
empty theatre.
Whatever absurdity or exaggertition
the piece may once have had has long
since evaporated, and Mr. O’Shaugh-
nessy’s performance does nothing to
recapture the comedy : mini or
otherwise. They form a neat enough
double, however, giving both actors a
large and a small part, and, for con-
noisseurs of acting (a lady in the
foyer said, “I was lucky enough to see
Peter O’Shaughnessy last time I was in
Sydney”), this is, no doubt, enough.
Mr. O’Shaughnessy already has
defended his one-man performances at
some length in this magazine (8.,
July 20) so, lest I, too, be branded “a
young academic with theatrical pre-
tentions,” I shall not invoke “the hum-
bugging word ensemble,” or defend
“upstart producers.” Let me simply
note a personal prejudice against self-
conscious displays of “acting” and
offer the evolutionary speculation that
actors who ride in “vehicles” may lose
the use of their legs.
At the Wayside Chapel, the avant-
garde! I can’t resist one more quote
from the program, which is one of the
funniest I have ever read: “Some of
the plays seen here may be classified
as avant-garde . . . Though we wel-
come young people, we do not intend
to lean over backwards to cajole youth
into the theatre, nor to sacrifice
artistic vision, nor the marvellous am-
bience of Dramatic Art to an obsessive
concern with keeping ‘with it’.” The
same slightly hysterical, defensive tone
dominates all the program notes
but I promise I won’t call Marguerite
Duras’ harmless little duologue or
lonesco’s “Delire a Deux” of 1963 too-
obsessively “with it.” In fact it is very
pleasant to see a sample of Mar-
guerite Duras’ beautiful dialogue on
stage.
Meeting for a last time after divorce,
a man and a woman talk in snatches
about their relationship and end with
a “nothing” that is somehow
equivocal. Mr. O’Shaughnessy under-
plays and throws away with masterful
ease, leaving Miss Bartlett rather at
variance on a much more naive,
naturalistic level, with the result that
they do not build up enough tension
together to justify the outbursts of des-
pair and entreaty at the end.
lonesco’s “Frenzy for Two” is an
excellent little play, which discusses
indifference and destructiveness in a
very forceful way a man and a
woman wrangle grotesquely as the
building they live in is destroyed by
a war raging outside. They argue on
about snails and tortoises as the war
changes to victory celebrations and
then, after an ominous silence, they
resume their argument, slapping each
other’s face.
Mr. O’Shaughnessy is quite at his
best in this play, making the most
of lonesco’s word games and nonsense
logic. The play is staged as well as the
limitations of the theatre permit, and,
no doubt, in a style pretty similar to
that of French productions. I hope
Nine O’Clock Theatre will continue to
find plays as worthwhile as this even
if they are a little avant-garde and
sometimes call for more than one actor.

THE FEEBLE HALLELUJAH
MUSIC in the churches of the Sydney
Diocese is, with too few exceptions,
at an abysmal level. The feeble
quality and quantity of sound that
emanates from the choir stalls rarely
enspirits and usually brings on irritation
or ennui. Ninety percent of the clergy
seem to be apathetic about the prob-
lem; nine percent contribute to it by-
advocating the guitar - and - bongo
approach, which attracts adolescent
anti-social delinquents and alienates re-
sponsible, cultivated adults.
All is not lost, though. St. James’s
Church, King Street, is about to essay
a performance of Handel’s “Samson”
and one can only hope that their enter-
prise will have some effect on the
musical wasteland which stretches
almost without relief through the
religious life of the community.
WHEN ONLY THE BEST, ETC.
THE RODIN sculpture exhibition,
which toured Australia under the spon-
sorship of Peter Stuyvesant, is now in
New Zealand at the expense of two
other' brands of the same cigarette
company, Rothmans and Dunhill.
For some reason, the exhibition has
shocked one or two provincial coun-
cillors, and when the Prime Minister,
Mr. Holyoake, opened the showing in
Wellington he said he had been warned
that he would be “revolted” by one
or two pieces, but hadn’t managed to
be. What did shock 'more thoughtful
New Zealanders was that it cost the
cigarette company as much to tour the
exhibition as the Queen Elizabeth II
Arts Council, the subsidising body for
the arts, has to spend in a year.
The Arts Council is financed by the
Golden Kiwi Lottery, which has none
of the buoyancy of the Sydney Opera
House one. The only recent burst of
generosity is a $4000 art prize — and
that has come from Benson and
Hedges.
BULGING POCKETS
FROM pulpy origins, the paperback
pocketbook industry has become a solid
support of the publishing business, and
in Sydney has just spawned “the largest
paperback bookshop in Australia—if
not the Southern Hemisphere,” what-
ever that means. The boast, and the
shop, belong to Jim Thorburn, an
amiable Glaswegian who came to Aus-
tralia ten years ago by way of New
Zealand. Since he took over Sydney’s
original Pocket Bookshop in Penfold
Place, Thorburn has progressed through
four different addresses, having either
outgrown his surroundings or been
moved on by Whelan the Wrecker. Last
week he moved again—into a King
.Street shop with 2500 sq. ft. of space
and shelves to take the 27,000 paper-
back titles he carries.
“When I began in Penfold Place,”
he says, “there were no more than 5000
English paperback titles available; not
pulp or trash, but good-quality titles.
Now there are more than 50,000 English
and at least 20,000 American titles
available to Australia. Penguins alone
have nearly 3000 titles in print at any
one time. It’s now a very competitive
business, and if you’re a bookseller you
have to be discriminating.” The safest
stock, says Thorburn, is serious science-
fiction, which is in consistent demand.
BALDING BUT BOLDER
LONDON “OZ” magazine, the lusty
progeny of the Sydney idea, is back
on sale again after being out of pub-
lication for almost two months be-
cause of financial troubles. “OZ” 13,
published early in July, looked like
being the last. The magazine faced
a £650 out-of-court settlement of
a libel writ, had expenses over an
obscenity charge (following publica-
tion of five offending shots from a
blue movie), and had to meet a heavy
bill for purchase tax after the
authorities had ruled that two issues
had entered a higher tax bracket.
Supporters must have rallied to an
urgent appeal for funds: “OZ” 14 was
due out last week in full color. “It’s
a sort of Color Me ‘OZ’,” says 25-year-
old Paul Lawson, the editor of the
issue.
“ ‘OZ’ has changed since its Sydney
beginnings. The hairy parts are few
and we have lots of very good writers
working for us. The Oxford book of
design includes slabs of ‘OZ’ layouts
and designs. It is now a McLuhanised
encounter for the disenchanted genera-
tion. It’s gone a long way from its
‘Private Eye’ days.”
Richard Neville, who will be editing
the following issue, is at present work-
ing on the BBC-TV program “Plow
It Is,” while cartoonist Martin Sharp
is said to have “retired from the
inanities of the English scene to the
island of Formentera, near Ibiza.” And
not, it would seem, a moment too
soon. Last week the boys had another
visit from Scotland Yard’s pornography
squad to do with a cartoon of Enoch
Powell which appeared in a recent
edition.

IT ISN'T REALLY
QUITE AS EASY
AS ALL THAT
By TERRY COUITS
A Study of Literature. David Daiches.
Andre Deutsch. $4.70.
DR. JOHNSON once said that the only
purpose of writing books was to make
money. Now, 20 years after it was
written, Professor Daiches’ book is
made available to the buying public for
a second time, so, I suppose, by John-
sonian standards at least, it must be
fairly successful. It would be a very
rash man indeed who would challenge
the standards of a Johnson, but in the
present case—and it is only as a “case”
that Daiches claims our attention—we
may indulge in further wonderings,
aside from the book’s success. For
example, why is it that this book should
be successful? Who constitute the pub-
lic demanding its reissue? Now that it
is here, what are we supposed to do
with it? Read it?
If anyone does decide to read “A
Study of Literature,” he will find many
disappointments and difficulties in store
for him. It is, presumably, a theoretical
book, a general book about general
problems pertaining to the study of
literature. But Daiches knows that
theoretical books can have their
dangers, and consequently links up
many of his thoughts with actual works
of literature and names of authors. An
index of these works and names is pro-
vided, and this index is in itself a
testimony to the easy breadth of
Daiches’ erudition Latin, Greek,
English, Russian, French, German,
poets, novelists, dramatists, philos-
ophers, humorists, dictators only
space prevents me from doing full
justice to this index.
Such an expansive array might en-
force a certain kind of respect; it
would, if we weren’t so consistently
baffled when we turn away from the
index to see what is said about some
of these names. For example, on
Corneille and Racine (p. 66) we get
this:
“The more elevated the theme the
greater the distance, and technical de-
vices (e.g., diction) must be so
arranged that they keep the reader
at that distance. (The reason why so
few English-speaking readers appreciate
Racine and Corneille is that they
underestimate the aesthetic distance re-
quired for the proper reading of these
writers.)”
Let us come out and say it bluntly
Professor Daiches is a name-
dropper. One could substitute the
names Homer and Sophocles for
Racine and Corneille without
making any significant difference to
the argument. Far from providing the
real basis for Daiches’ theorising
the raw material out of which the
generalisations grow, as it were his
erudition is no more than a smoke-
screen, behind which all sorts of
shadowy goings-on take place.
One such is this very matter of
“aesthetic distance,” a phrase which
smacks of Lubbockese, though it is
certainly Daiches’ own. The phrase is
put to all sorts of work (the above
quotation provides a fair example),
yet nowhere do we get much of an
idea of what it is meant to convey:
it may fairly be taken as an example
of • Daiches’ handling of critical
language. He tells us, for example,
that “the question of ‘aesthetic dis-
tance’ is important.” He goes on to
assert that all works of art have it;
suggestively, he claims “the difference
between Pope and Wordsworth or be-
tween Milton and Burns is essen-
tially a difference in the aesthetic dis-
tance required by the works of each”;
that, in turn, it is the lead-up to the
stuff about “elevated” themes and the
clinching allusion to Corneille and
Racine.
The sense I get when reading
through such a book of a great
hollowness at the centre can be
traced to this very lack of definition.
Not that one wants set definitions of
terms used; such a procedure inevit-
ably freezes literary criticism, whatever
it may do elsewhere (indeed, Daiches
himself goes in for this). The language
of literary criticism must constantly
define and explain itself as it goes;
there are no terms of literary criticism
—or very few—which have a currency
value available to all; a “critic” must
constantly be aware of the need to
establish the force and suggestiveness
of the language he uses, and once that
awareness is lost he will produce
jargon.
Which brings us back to Professor
Daiches. The absence of this awareness
in his writing closely related, at
bottom, to that habit of throwing off
casual private allusions to writers and
works can be felt most clearly in a
characteristic tone, or rather cadence,
of his prose. His writing moves along
like a series of proverbs, randomly
connected. The book, in fact, abounds
in proverbial wisdom, arid in so far as
this goes the proverbs themselves are
unobjectionable: “oral literature must
lie in the mind, for otherwise it would
be forgotten”; “interest in possibilities
is more primitive and fundamental than
interest in probabilities”; “the true
creative writer drops his words into
our mind like stones in a pool”;
“language training as a humanistic
study must be accurate or it is nothing.”
Distinguishing “art” and “craft,”
he gives us this:
“Mere craftsmanship is sometimes
called in to tide the writer over when
his vision temporarily fails. And,
separated from its function in the
artist’s unified conception of the
whole, no longer buoyed aloft on the
wings of an insight which keeps
it from flagging or falling down, crafts-
manship sometimes falters and allows
the fires of the novel to die down.
(The metaphor is mixed deliberately,
in an endeavor to make the point
by as many analogies as possible.)”
The blandly confident tone about
the way the artist’s mind works is
revealing. In the beginning of his
book, Professor Daiches arouses one’s
interest by his air of not shrinking
from the most difficult problems. But
“not shrinking from difficulties” turns
out to be a much rarer habit of mind
than remaining unaware that diffi-
culties exist, and Daiches’ constant air
of grappling with immensities and the
most delicate discriminations proves
to be a bluff. His own habits of mind
are those of a man who has read
a good deal Percy Lubbock is
one of his favorites, with reservations;
reservations derived in the main from
“Scrutiny,” and in other ways,
Matthew Arnold and, having read,
has formed opinions.
In the main, his opinions are not
silly ones. But the easy chattiness of
the whole book does not derive from
the kind of intelligence needed to
say something new and significant
about the large question the book
poses: What is the nature of literary
value? We don’t go to a “man of
opinions” for enlightenment on that
sort of question. What the book has
to say about it could be summarised
in a few sentences, without too much
injustice: what is said is old-hat, so
I won’t perform the summary. The
rest is dressing up: fine discriminations
over non-problems, and irrelevancies,
some of which have already been
suggested.
The dust-jacket blurb praises Pro-
fessor Daiches for what might have
been the very thing I seem to find
myself maligning, in terms such as “easy
chattiness.” There is a curious fashion
among English academics all over the
world to deplore the vast masses of
criticism being churned out yearly by
their colleagues. All churn; all deplore.
Perhaps it is with this fashion in mind
that the blurb tells us “A Study of
Literature” is “neither obscure nor dif-
ficult,” being without “the complexity
and precociousness that mar so much
modern criticism.” This could prove
tempting, especially in these days of a
radically new school syllabus in Eng-
lish, which is tending to drive pupils
and teachers more and more to the
critics.
All I can say is, I hope no one is
driven by his own sense of the diffi-
culties of “English” to this book: he
will meet with frustration on every page.
The surface simplicity of the language
is there only because no actual difficulty
is ever met; while the inexactness of
most of the terminology will tend to
leave readers much in the same position
as when they took up the book. A
man who has already explained prob-


lems away for himself will be satisfied
to find that his theories receive no
abrupt rebuttal from Daiches; anyone
who has genuine difficulties will find it
an effort to progress beyond the first
page, in spite of the book’s “lack of
complexity.”
THE "SILVER CITY"
By FRANK ROBERTS
The Rise of Broken Hill. Geoffrey
Blainey. Macmillan. $5.
BROKEN HILL’S “crucible years” be-
tween the 1880 s and the 1920 s are his-
torian Geoffrey Blainey’s main concern
in this book, which he describes as
“more a volume of essays than an
orthodox history.” While the historical
background of some of the events it
embraces is certainly sketchy enough to
require some such disclaimer, it is a
much better book than the author’s
description suggests!
Blainey’s forte is clarity. His story
of Broken Hill, from Charles Rasp’s
first chipping of the gigantic lode’s out-
crop in 1883, through the years of stop-
and-go development (vast technical
problems much more often the stoppers
than labor problems, the solution of
Fuel for BHP smelters, 1890s
one as frequently leading to renewed
prosperity as solution of the other) to
the emergence of a different Broken
Hill, the mines under new manage-
ments, landscape and conditions more
pleasant, is presented to the reader as
a well-guided canter through only .160
pages of local history. Few books of
this kind do as much in twice the dis-
tance.
Then there are 86 photographs,
mostly of the early days (say, 1880 to
1910), of the workings, mining, and
town life at Broken Hill, bound into
the volume in six- to 12-page clusters,
which might alone be worth the price
of the book and they certainly
illuminate Blainey’s text. They also
diminish some of the doubt that could
be raised by the preface note that the
book “is one of the ventures marking
the 75th anniversary of the Australian
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.”
It’s a better book than that suggests.
A history of Broken Hill would have
to go into the city’s long industrial
troubles more than Blainey does,
especially the 1919-20 Big Strike, where
his telling of events is most sketchy;
but where, also, he sums up causes and
after-effects with an uncommitted his-
torian’s fairness. Where, also, he
heightens his effort for clarity with one,
rare, effective simile: “The strike made
the 1909 strike look like a tea-break.”
As a more general example of the
author’s style: “Hundreds of millions
of years ago, all the ore at Broken Hill
had been sulphide ore. This ore con-
tained zinc, lead, and sulphur in large
quantities, and also a generous sprink-
ling of silver. In shape, the deposit of
ore was like a coathanger or boom-
erang, with the apex of the boomerang
on the surface and the far ends buried
far underground. Over the years, the
part of the lode nearest the surface
was changed by the wind and rain and
sun —in short it was oxidised. That
slow process removed the soluble sul-
phur and zinc from the upper part of
the lode and, in consequence, left the
silver and lead relatively enriched.
Understandably it was the oxidised ore
which Rasp found . . . whereas the
Underground conditions, 1890s
unaltered sulphide ore was buried
deep.”
That describes the genesis of Broken
Hill Proprietary, which mined the
“apex of the boomerang” vigorously
for the first 20 years or so, and then
decreasingly until 1940, when it with-
drew from Broken Hill for ever. Blainey
shows how some of the early principal
shareholders, neither mining men nor
investors, but pastoralists, proceeded to
use their fortunes with daring, crea-
ting other national industries as North’s
and South’s directors have done more
recently.
“The Rise of Broken Hill” continues
with the rise of other companies mining
the deeply buried ends of the boom-
erang, the revelations of long-unreal-
ised • miners’ illnesses which continued
into the 19205, the new uses to which
mountains of “tailings” were put,
changes in the Hill’s methods of both
hollowing out the rich rock and filling
the cavities to prevent “creep,” and,
eventually, the various inquiries and
wages hearings which ended in 1920
with advanced working conditions—just
as world metal prices began two decades
of instability which gradually reduced
the number of workings from 11 in
1920 to three in 1940. (Now four
again.)
Toward the end of the book, the
historian puts his finger on what was
probably the main cause of earlier
troubles at Broken Hill, “the crucial
fact that employees at Broken Hill
were divided fairly equally between
rich mines and marginal mines” which
were expected to treat their workers
equally—or go out of business and em-
ploy no one.
In his epilogue, in which Blainey
says “the story leaps forward to touch
the field as it is today,” there are clues
touching the present industrial troubles
threatening Broken Hill. “Since the
mid-1950s the workforce at Broken Hill
has fallen by about one-third, but pro-
duction of ore has increased. Broken
Hill today mines and treats more ore
than ever before.”
NOBLE COWARD
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Illustrious House of Ramires. Eca
de Queiroz. Bodley Head. $3.90.
IF DE QUEIROZ had been anything
else but a Portuguese my guess is that
his name would be known not only to
the cognoscenti, as now, but that it
would also be dropped about as often
as the names of his contemporaries
Flaubert, Zola, and Tolstoy. But this
is typical. In Lisbon, the natives will
tell you, with a sad, resigned shrugging
of shoulders, that the world has for-
gotten them. It thinks of them, if it
thinks of them at all, only as a paler,
smaller, gentler, and less significant
edition of bigger, naughtier, and some-
what dirtier big brother Spain. Portu-
gal’s glory, they say, lies all in the
past. Vasco da Gama is dead. No one
talks about their bullfights they don’t
kill the bull. No one talks about their
cats they are belled to warn the
birds. Not enough tourists come to
see their Moorish castles though the
white peacocks still stroll in the
grounds as they did in the days of the
Crusaders.
Appropriately, the real hero of this
story is Portugal. The novel is actually
an allegory, though very subtle and
unforced, and the central figure, Gon-
calo Mendes Ramires, is intended as
the personification of the whole
country. But the author saves this
precise revelation till the last page . . .
in an astonishingly modern use of the
punchline. In fact, the whole work
impresses so often by its contemporary
outlook that it is difficult at times to
remember that it was actually written
last century, and that Eca de Queiroz
has been dead these 68 years. The only
reminders are the leisurely but far
from boring pace and the fascinating


glimpses of the happy feudalism then
in force, which may have paved the
way for the “mild dictatorship” (a
Portuguese expression) of more recent
times.
The young Goncalo is the last of a
heroic line, scion of a noble house
older even than Portugal itself. Lov-
ingly tended by faithful retainers, he
lives the life of an idle gentleman on
his impoverished estates, occasionally
wistfully contemplating from his win-
dow the ancient monument known as
the Tower of Ramires —a gaunt symbol
of his heritage, his family’s faded power
and glory. Weak, good natured, in-
dolent, and slightly frivolous, Goncalo
is nevertheless full of unselfconscious
charm and impulsive generosity. His
character is drawn in a hundred tell-
ing Tolstoyan touches —in the set of his
hat, in his sudden quixotic good deeds,
in his genuine friendship with a simple
fado singer (a kind of Portuguese
version of the flamenco), and, above all,
in his ridiculous cowardice, which causes
him oh, height of indignity to
run away in abject fear whenever even
the lowliest of his minions insults him.
Yet, mysteriously, these ignominious
retreats are always transformed into
deeds of amazing valor when retold
to friends and retainers.
Nagged by a publisher acquaintance
into attempting a short historical novel,
“The Tower of Don Ramires,” during
his research Goncalo is both shamed
by all those heroic feats he cannot
emulate and disgusted by his ancestors’
acts of barbarism. Enemies are sucked
to death by leeches or get molten
metal poured down their throats. But
a Ramires always dies before his
courage.
Stifling his conscience, the young
nobleman prepares to sell his only sur-
viving possession—his own basic integ-
rity. He accepts a nomination as
local deputy for the parliamentary
elections, thus knowingly delivering
himself and his sister into the hands
of his sponsor, the Civil Governor, an
unsavory part-time Don Juan. Finally,
to go the whole hog, he seriously pur-
sues a plump butcher’s daughter on
his own account, with the dishonorable
intention of marrying her just for her
money. Goncalo’s soul is already being
offered up for barter, the devil
metaphorically sharpening his quill,
when on the brink of the abyss the
spirits of his ancestors rise up in warn-
ing. This psychological turning-point is
magnificently handled. In a waking-
dream the ghosts of his warrior fore-
bears appear to invade his room and
parade before him. At last he is faced
with his own weakness: he admits he
is a coward. As he turns to confront
his fear (another modern touch) he
finds he can control it. The unhero is
dead. Long live the hero.
Moreover, in a sudden revelation,
comparable in its way with Prince
Andrey’s in “War and Peace,” he be-
lieves he sees the true meaning of life:
elected to parliament in triumphant
scenes that pre-parody today’s political
circuses, he rejects the hollow victory;
he frees his sister from the Don Juan;
spurns the butcher’s unvirtuous
daughter; returns the village bully’s
attack; declines a new title from the
King; and departs as a sturdy pioneer
for a spell in the wilds of Africa. His
future is clearly indicated a child
bride who is, meanwhile, just growing
out of the schoolroom, noble, lovely,
and (marvellous bonus) also wealthy—
the illustrious house of Ramires will
continue.
The analogy is obvious: Portugal
may doze about in the sun, idly dream-
ing of past majesty, shy, reticent, self-
effacing. But its courage is not dead,
only dormant. In time it will be stirred
again. Meanwhile its sons must seek
adventures overseas . . . but their
brides, at home.
NEW CHUMS AND OLD
By NANCY KEESING
Gone Troppo. John O’Grady. Ure
Smith. $2.75.
A Bottle of Sandwiches. Denis O’Grady.
Ure Smith. $2.75.
Pacific Book of Australian SF. Ed.
John Baxter. Angus & Robertson. $l.
THE “NEW CHUM” theme is as old
as writing and singing in Australia. It
takes the place of an English tradition
of poking fun gentle or malicious,
at the ineptitudes of people of other
classes, and foreigners. Even Dad and
Dave, whose direct descendants many
John O’Grady people are, were essen-
tially new chums. Once a person masters
the special skills connected with his
job or place in life, he is disqualified
as a buffoon.
The “Gone Troppo” new chum is not
a city type in the bush or vice versa,
but a Northern Territory cattleman
trying a job at a Queensland island
tourist resort. His usually booted feet
are too soft for coral paths and oyster
shells, he’s never worn thongs, and
they trip him he slithers and slips
on wet floors, slimy decks, and so on.
He gets pretty tangled up with the
lovely girls in his life. There’s a Benier
drawing to ram home the true horror
of each farcical mishap, but the real
focus of the book is, as usual, O’Grady’s
version of Australian dialogue. A
formula it may be, but an excellent one
of its kind.
The O’Grady factory is spreading,
moreover. John’s son Denis now offers
his interpretation of what this journal
used to call the Australian “slanguage.”
“A Bottle of Sandwiches” is a seem-
ingly artless account of a round-Austra-
lia jaunt undertaken by the author, his
dog Boof, and an assortment of mates
and vehicles. A variety of people, places,
jobs, pubs, and drinks are described
solid food is caught or bought and eaten
sometimes. Ancient engines and baleful
crocodiles dispel complacency. Clarrie
King interprets the text in black and
white. Christmas is co’ming?
I approached the SF book with mis-
givings, thinking that I knew virtually
nothing of science fiction and would be
incompetent to assess it fairly. If I can-
not make informed remarks and com-
parisons I state my surprise and delight
at discovering an immensely enjoyable
side-track in our writing, which I shall
certainly explore further.
The stories are all well written;
though few of the names of authors are
generally known, one suspects a pseu-
donym or two. Many of the contri-
butors are young, but the demands of
the genre prevent those sad, chip-on-
the-shoulder stories which the young
so often offer. Imagination is blessedly
“in” tepid autobiography “out.”
Another surprise is the realisation that
one has read SF, without knowing it,,
for much of one’s life. Kit Denton’s
“Burning Spear” recalls Kipling well
enough to bear comparison. There are
echoes of Algernon Blackwood, Anatole
France, and those deliciously creepy old
volumes of ghost stories that once froze
my schoolgirl blood.
A few tales are very funny; the book’s
longest, by Jack Wodhams, is brilliant
comedy, although I can’t claim to have
understood it properly perhaps I was
not supposed to. SF proves to be an
excellent medium for satire and the
spooky irony of “All My Yesterdays.”
Truly, this anthology would make a
valuable co'mpulsory textbook for all
yearning, arty-crafty beginners who-
flock to creative writing courses and
sneer at editorial and market demands
—it shows that straightforward, crafts-
man-like writing for entertainment can
be very much of a true art. My thanks
for the collection to John Baxter—he
has made a convert.

A declared regionalist
You state in an article (8., August
24) “Turning the Tables on John Gor-
ton” that Mr. Don Chipp, MP,
“appeared to have crossed right over
from the Fairhall-Hasluck regionalist
position to the Kent Hughes-Wentworth
retractionist ‘Fortress Australia’ con-
cept.”
I would be glad if you would correct
this erratic and unfounded “Think-
piece” by an anonymous writer. I not
only agree with the Government’s
regionalist position (which I hope is
a correct assumption) but for five weeks
of the recess I made a private visit to
nine countries in the region in order to
try to further this project.
I have no knowledge of the Hon.
W. C. Wentworth’s views, but would
be pleased if you would give as much
prominence to my correction, as regards
my policy, as you did to its misrepre-
sentation.

"Farmer Power"
As one who had some part in the
effort to develop the specialty of veter-
inary gynaecology in this country, I
was intrigued at the novel twist given
to contraception in The Land (8.,
August 24). I could not quite divine
the point your contributor was making
in his reference to sterilised rams; but
surely farmers rarely intend to prevent
or abort a conception if the breeding
program has proceeded as far as coitus
and insemination. The difference be-
tween sexual rest and suppression of
fertility may be subtle, but it is signi-
ficant, both in controlled mating and
in relation to the Encyclical. It’s the
difference between starting the process
of conception and not starting it.
Although, through the paucity of
investigators, the problem of northern
bovine infertility has scarcely been
defined, we are confidently assured that
the primary cause is sexual precocity,
a “fact” that will surprise many workers
in the field. Rather than adding con-
traception to the program, some had
thought it desirable to increase concep-
tions by reducing anoestrus and by
ensuring that all suitable cows in
oestrus are actually inseminated. For
whereas bulls are usually well served
when their sexual appetites are in the
ascendant, broad acres may well isolate
a proportion of the females from sexual
fulfilment; so space and time may
reduce fertility. Surprisingly, nobody
has worried about the mental stress of
sexual deprivation in livestock, although
for Homo sapiens the hypothesis has
now become the Hefner Doctrine.
As to the underlying thesis of your
contributor, I find myself in agreement.
Primary producers engaged in the bio-


logical industry of conducting the
energy of sunlight through the catalysts
of living organisms may leave pessi-
mism to others. “Farmer Power” is as
large as solar energy, and we are not
yet faced with an explosion of live-
stock numbers. They will have cause
enough to despair if, just as we’re about
to “grasp the very mainspring of evolu-
tion,” our intellect jams the mechanism
of life; or if the sun should rise one
dawn and give no light.

Saroyan's nose
Reference your correspondent (page 5,
8., August 24). I am quoted as having
said in the course of a lecture for the
Australian Society of Authors, “
Saroyan really became famous as a
writer after he was punched on the
nose by James Mason.”
What I did say, in fact, was that
although Saroyan had achieved a con-
siderable literary reputation he did not
receive any widespread publicity in the
world Press until he was punched on
the nose in a brawl in a nightclub by
the actor James Mason. Just how true
this story was, is a matter for con-
jecture, but I was concerned with the
story, not its veracity.

The Townsend case
I agree that Paul Johnson should
have given the end of the Simon
Townsend saga in his “New Statesman”
article (8., June 29).
But what horrified me, after five
years’ absence from Australia, is that
such psychologically barbarous treat-
ment could occur there, and that a
responsible Minister could countenance
this.
To me this means that there has
developed a strong wave of repression
of independent thought and action in
Australia, where people who do not
agree with the drafting of themselves
to the aggressive war in Vietnam can
be mentally tortured.
I know this treatment of Simon
Townsend was eventually stopped: but
what group feeling in part of the com-
munity brought it about?

Student unrest
I agree with P. Allan, M. Johnston,
P. Freeman, D. Shellard (8., August
10) that to kill is immoral, but I think
the refusal to defend those who are
being killed for the sake of establishing
the dictatorship of the Communist
Party (or any other dictatorship) is
more immoral. I am perfectly sure
that the Australian Government would
not have sent our soldiers to Vietnam
if the Communists did not strike first.
To those four students the danger
from the Communists is not imminent.
If they examined why they would have
found that it was the resistance to
Communist domination which made
that danger far removed. If the Com-
munists were allowed to stay in Iran
after the war, or succeeded in Korea,
or with their blockade of Berlin, or
with the aggression in Malaya or in
Vietnam, or with their rockets in Cuba,
with such an ease as they succeeded in
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania,
Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania,
then that danger would have been much
nearer.
As with all religious fanatics (Com-
munists are fanatical believers in
Marxism-Leninism) an easy success is
a proof that the world belongs to them.
My thanks to all who make it difficult
for them.

Bury the Ashes?
Batman’s article (8., August 17)
headed “Isn’t it Time to Bury the
Ashes?” poses one question by its
title, and another: Could international
cricketers be persuaded to play real
cricket if we did bury the Ashes? Most
cricket followers would answer the
first with an emphatic “Yes.” To the
second, I think some attempt should
be made to provide a new set-up that
will provide cricketers with the oppor-
tunity to restore to the game some
of its former glory.
To my mind, every match played
by a touring side should be com-
petitive; and, to bring this about
should improve the chances of the
paying public getting value for its
money. The existing practice of mak-
ing all other matches mere practise
games for five Test matches has
definitely been found wanting.
The experiment I would suggest
as a remedy is: during the next English
visit to Australia and during the next
Australian tour of England play no
Test matches at all. Instead, in Aus-
tralia, let the English team compete
in the Sheffield Shield, and, in Eng-
land, let the Australian team take part
in the Country Championship, the
length of the matches and the points
system in both instances being those
prevailing at the time.
While agreeing with nearly all the
ideas expressed in Batman’s article,
I diverge from him on one point. I
think the main trouble about drawn
games is not that they occur in Test
matches as in other games but, rather,
that only in Tests do we ignore the
obvious, though admittedly imperfect,
solution of awarding points to the
side leading on the first innings. In
the current series, the superiority of
the English team in the second and
third Tests was demonstrated just as
clearly as that of the Australian team
was in the first. To apply Sheffield
Shield points and make the score
after the third Test Australia 10,
England 8 would surely be a more
correct assessment than Australia I,
England 0.
A few years ago, in a Sheffield
Shield match between Victoria and
N.S.W. at Melbourne, each side
amassed a large first-innings total,
but interest was maintained over four
days as the game developed into a
tense struggle for first-innings points.
The match certainly did not die when
it became evident that an outright
decision would not be reached.

Hyph-ened humor
The Bulletin should buy Ross Camp-
bell a gross of those slender cigars he
smokes so rakishly. His piece on the
hazards of hyphens (8., August 31) was
so warmly funny that I have clipped
it and will keep it to protect me against
the bleakness of the wasteland that is
now Australian humorous writing. His
pathetic and pitifully few conte'mpor-
aries should feel humbly chag-rined by
his consistently splendid output.

Freedom for all
The absurdities of N.S.W. Chief
Secretary Willis’ thinking on censor-
ship are unquestionable. But the Bulle-
tin did a service by noting the equal
stupidity of Mr. Willis’ most ardent
critics at “The Last Hurrah” (8.,
August 31).
This cause has been compared by
its “intellectual” leaders with those
other protests for “fundamental adult
liberties” which focus on Vietnam
or Biafra or Czechoslovakia, even
though it stems from a demand for
freedom to scrawl graffiti on a public
stage rather than a more basic one
of being allowed to stay alive.
And should not old ladies, no matter
how illogically sensitive to sex they
may have become, be given some free-
dom too, to lead their humdrum lives,
whether in parks or public theatres,
without fear of unnecessary, painful
embarrassment?
Of course “America Hurrah” should
be performed as it was written, for
it has something worth while to say.
And in London they performed it
under club conditions. Any old lady
could attend after she had first filled
in a brief application form, paid a
few cents membership fee, and waited
for 48 hours. And many of them did,
with some idea at least of what they
were in for, and many of them under-
went a painful experience nonetheless.
Only they found no grounds for com-
plaint.
