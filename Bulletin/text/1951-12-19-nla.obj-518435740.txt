MELROSE, ONCE-SPLENDID SHRINE OF BORDER MEMORIES
MOST of Scotland’s history is written upon the romantic countryside of the
Borderlands, and has been recorded in many stirring ballads. This is the
countryside that Sir Walter Scott knew and loved, and where he returned to
die. In his famous poem “The Lay of the Last Minstrel” he describes the
legend of the wooded Eildon Hills, at the foot of which, beside the placid Tweed
and among the meadows, lies the beautiful fragment of Melrose Abbey.
The ruins, with their lacelike tracery and elaborate detail, suggest the
splendour of the original design. Dating chiefly from the fifteenth century,
the Abbey stands upon the site of two previous buildings, the first of which
was founded and richly endowed by David I in 1136 tor Cistercian nuiiks
from Rievaulx Abbey in Yorkshire. During the turbulent days of the
fourteenth century the Abbey, which lay in the path of English raiders, was
damaged time and again, notably in 1322. Four years later Robert Bruce
restored it, and when he died his heart, according to tradition, was buried
there beneath the East window, having been brought back, from Spain, where
Douglas had carried it on the way to the Holy Land.
In 1544 and 1545, during the most destructive raids of Border history,
when the Earl of Hertford invaded Scotland, Melrose Abbey was again
plundered and seriously damaged. Thereafter the Abbey fell into gradual
decay, assisted by the quarrying of its stone for building materials. Queen
Mary granted the Abbey to Bothwell, and later it passed through many hands
until presented in 1918 by the Duke of Buccleuch to the nation, and is now
preserved as an ancient monument. In the adjoining churchyard is the red
stone erected by Sir Walter Scott on the grave of Tom Purdie, his favourite
henchman, who was the wood-forester at Abbotsford.

BOOKS FOR CHRISTMAS.
This Way Home: Vicars Bell (Faber).
Mr. Bell has already written one auto-
biography—about his life as a village
schoolmaster —and this is a companion-
piece, about the village itself and the
farms and farmers around it. Pleasant
writing about a farmer curing a cut finger
with cobwebs, the perils of cycling in the
early days of the Machine Age, and how
the village likes the man who comes
round in a van with pots and pans and
brushes but doesn’t like the fanatics who
distribute tracts ; a pleasant prose style—
“ Blazing, dizzy days when the whole slope
shivers in an opal haze and the sheep-
bells seem to be an aural expression of
the evanescent light” ; and a very pleasant
and sensible philosophy in which Mr.
Bell maintains that modern man needs to
be more closely in touch with nature and
that “the people” don’t want Culture on
the Community Centre lines, but a bit of
land to cultivate.

/ Cannot Rest from Travel: Willard
Price (Heinemann). It is mildly discon-
certing in the review copy of this auto-
biography to find a section of the pages
out of place, so that page 26 leads straight
on, widdershins, to page 19 ; but it happens
to matter very little, for Mr. Price’s travels
as a writer and field-worker for museums
have taken him into 70 countries, and
wherever he goes, whether backwards or
forwards, he has something colorful and
exciting to tell. He begins by paddling
about on a ppnd in the U.S.; works on
a coal-boat where the only book on board
is Swedenborg’s Heaven and Hell, owned
by the oiler; does a starve in London;
then the horrors and humors of Korean
hospitals, the mineral wealth and indus-
trial progress of Siberia, headhunters on
the Amazon . . . here, there and every-
where in an exceptionally rich and like-
able travel-book.

Cases That Changed the Law: Mont-
gomery Hyde (Heinemann). An interest-
ing survey of some cases as dramatic as
they were legally important; including,
among many others, Burke and Hare ;
the Phoenix Park murderers; Oscar Wilde.
The author is a barrister.
* * * *
The Last of the Radicals: C. V. Wedg-
wood (Cape). Life of “Josh” Wedgwood,
by his niece, who previously wrote
Strafford and William the Silent. “Josh,”
who was in the House of Commons for
35 years and in the House of Lords for
two years, first a Liberal, then Labor,
“but essentially independent,” fought in
the Boer War and the Great War, and
two of the most vivid chapters consist of
letters he wrote from South Africa and
—to Churchill —from Gallipoli, describing
the carnage and heroism of a landing
from a “wreck-ship.” In politics he
fought for freedom of speech, Home Rule,
Indian freedom, reform of the divorce
laws, single-taxation. The biography does
not quite present him “in the round” but
deals very capably with his public life,
and every now and again a very lively
“Josh” breaks through its marble surface;
as when, having been in a “Freedom
Defence League” with Wells, Belloc and
Chesterton, he commented that “it re-
mained active and united for nearly two
months” ; or when, wounded in the groin
at Gallipoli, he made the immortal pun
as he was being carried to the shore (re-
ferring to the House of Commons as
well as his wound), “Thank God my seat
is safe.”

Jack Solomons Tells All: Jack Solo-
mons (Rich and Cowan). With 33 illustra-
tions —27 of Mr. Solomons, in 16 of
which he is wearing a cigar and an
expansive grin, Mr. Solomons, who is,
of course, Britain’s leading boxing-pro-
moter, tells what he has to tell in a
psuedo-tough, wisecracking parlance;
and if what he tells of his dealings with
the Australian boxer Dave Sands be com-
pared with the apparent experiences of
Sands in the course of a recent tour
under Mr. Solomons’s sponsorship, one
is inclined to suspect that Mr. Solomons
tells rather less than all.

Dr, Henry Meikle, Historiographer-
Royal of Scotland, has issued a new and
revised edition of the Short History of
Scotland prepared by Professor P. Hume
Brown in 1908 and reprinted again and
again for the benefit of Scottish school-
children. The work was enlarged in 1932
and made into a book for the general
reader, and Dr. Meikle has enlarged it
again in the present volume issued by
Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh, has brought
it up-to-date in the post-war years, and
embodied a good deal of very relevant
matter dealing with the Highlands which
was ignored by Hume Brown. It is an
artless-seeming work written in simple
language, yet it would be hard to find
a better overall reference-book. It will
be a happy day when Australia has a
school history of this continent as
complete, as simply phrased, as accurate
and as impartial on all issues (except on
the union with England). The book is
copiously and splendidly illustrated.

Long Innings: Sir Pelham Warner
(Harrap). Well past his three score and
ten and looking set for a century, “Plum”
Warner has hit upon an apt title for his
autobiography, but unfortunately he has
himself taken the title too literally. Long
Innings is principally the story of his
cricket life, and most of that has been
adequately covered in the course of a
dozen or so previous volumes. Admittedly
cricket in one connection or another has
played the major part in Warner’s life*,
but an autobiography should throw more
light on other aspects of an existence
which has coveted a pretty hectic period
of world history and most of the world’s
geography.
The Wind and the Flame: Manes
Sperber (Wingate). Translated from the
German and previously published in the
U.S. under the title The Burned Bramble,
this is the story of those idealists who
visualised the formation of a workers’
Germany out of the political chaos and
disunity of pre-Hitler Germany and of
their deception and blatant betrayal by
the Communist International, giving them
the choice of a shameful death or the
acceptance of a bitter cynicism and the
revision of their concepts of the party’s
ideals. The book is long—over 400 pages
—and the tendency of the Comrades to
indulge in lengthy dialectic on the slight-
est provocation and in almost any situa-
tion doesn’t make it seem any shorter.

Modern Book Design : Ruari McLean
(Longmans). A short account of the re-
emergence of good book-printing from
the mostly negative and characterless style
of the mid-nineteenth century. The
author, a tutor in typography at the
Royal College of Art, briefly mentions
ihe private presses, the revolution in print-
ing technique at the beginning of this
century, the gradual improvement in the
quality and design of commercial print-
ing and publishing, and the Penguin
books. Oddly enough for such a work
the format is not as good as could be
expected: though the layout and setting
are attractive, the three sewn 16-page sec-
tions, with, binder’s glue showing between
them from the precariously glued-on
cover, would have been better saddle-
stitched.

The Big Fish : Ronald Wills (Wingate).
“Chamber music to the average detective
story’s vaudeville,” we said of his previ-
ous detective novel, Live Bait. In this new
one, the background, the Allied Control
Commission in Germany, is more interest-
ing than the detecting; British big-shots
and their German-countess private secre-
taries ; sinister Germans threatening, dis-
closure of British officials’ blackmarket-
ing to the Secret Service unless the
officials frank the wrong passports;
murder of a big-shot’s wife ; amusing
frustration of the efforts of the amateur
detective, a British official, to make love
to his Canadian secretary; dark
.doings down the mine; eventual dis-
covery of a deep-laid international plot.
The load of new scenery and people is
a bit heavy for a detective story to carry ;
but merely as a novel about Germany
today it is well worth reading

Ballet: Cecil Beaton (Wingate). An
exceptionally readable “personal
memoir” in which there is not too much
backstage gossip, not too much history,
not too much rapture and not too much
technical talk but just enough of each to
make the book lively, graceful and
illuminating. Mr, Beaton begins by fall-
ing in love, at the age of seven, with “a
row of higffikicking ladies known as The
Palace Girls’ ”; at 12 he is throwing roses
to Pavlova; and then it is Diaghileff,
Massine, Helpmann, Baronova,
Toumanova, Riabouchinska ; the decline
in the Soviet (“The acme of tastelessness
and vulgarity.. . .Quite suddenly, and for
no apparent reason, there appeared a
triumphal procession of communal
farmers, Carrying vegetables annd fruit.
One flaunted the biggest vegetable
marrow on a platter ; another a pumpkin.
It was completely out of keeping with the
rest of the work, but without this
irrelevance the powers-that-be would not
have authorised the presentation of the
ballet”); and the latest developments in
Britain and America. One of the most
delightful pen-pictures of celebrities is
that of Lady Constance Stewart-
Richardson, who used to skip about the
stage in Mr. Beaton’s boyhood, wearing
the scantiest of draperies and tossing
tulips in all directions to the tune of
Mendelssohn’s “Spring Song” ; she was
also a crack shot at big game, a swim-
ming champion and once toured the Wild
West on horseback with Buffalo Bill,
hunting the wild hog; in London she
usually wore flowing Greek robes,
turban and sandals.
♦ * * ♦
North of the Circle : Frank Illingworth
(Hodge). Mr. Illingworth says that when
he was travelling into the Arctic Circle
by express from Stockholm, there was an
Australian in the carriage who, before
folding his hands across his paunch and
going to sleep, asked to be awakened
when they reached the line of white
stones marking the Circle —“I mustn’t
miss crossing the Circle. No, sir! Must
be able to tell the folks back home all
about it” . . . which doesn’t sound very
much like the Australian language but
which at least suggests that the Arctic is
becoming horribly civilised and that Mr.
Illingworth has inspected it in person.
Civilisation, in the form of coalmines,
electric light and, of course, preparations
fpr war, in Alaska and the Scandinavian
territories, is his principal theme, and with
that is mixed such of the traditional life
of the Arctic as survives, exemplified in
a fine marine photograph of a polar bear
with triplets. A journalistic book, full of
up-to-the-minute information.

The Complete Poems of Robert Frost
(Cape) is a new and handsome edition
replacing the earlier Collected Poems and
adding the contents of such recent books
as A Witness Tree, Steeple Bush, A
Masque of Reason and A Masque of
Mercy. The dong poems in Frost’s
colloquial New England style have never
been of very great value, except insofar
as they keep alive the tradition of Long-
fellow’s Tales of a Wayside Inn, from
which they derive; the later poems,
rather like Arnold Wall’s, deal pleasantly
with democracy, science and the modern
world; but it is the short nature-poems,
such as “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy
Evening” that still read most effectively
and will give Frost a minor but per-
manent place in the world’s poetry as
well as America’s.
* * * *
The Infinite Woman : Edison Marshall
(Shakespeare Head). The autobiography
of one Lola Montero, this novel is sup-
posed to be based on the life of the
adventuress Lola Montez, who would no
doubt indignantly (and justifiably) deny
any similarity to the peculiar person pre-
sented by the author. Lola Montero flits
about 19th-century Europe as a Spanish
dancer, forgets to come to Australia,
has a few varied and impromptu
love affairs and returns to England, where
she rewards her last lover, who has
pursued her through most of the book
with an intent gleam in his eye, by send-
ing him hurtling down a disused mine-
shaft. It all has very much the same air
as a previous novel, Gipsy Sixpence.
* * * *
“F.S.”: Evelyn Waugh, who has been
accorded the honor of having ten of his
titles published by Penguins, is, one pre-
sumes, in the great tradition of English
satire. Not that he shares the indigna-
tion and savagery of Swift; but the light
detachment of a Fielding. And he brings
to his subject-matter a special gift of his
own, urbanity, which replaces the great
gusto of Fielding. The present writer’s
first acquaintance with the personality of
Evelyn Waugh began in the early
’twenties. A friend had just returned
from Oxford and was describing the
aesthetes. “One of the queerest,” he said,
“was a bloke in my own college, brother
of the writer Alec Waugh. He had a
room hung entirely with black draperies,
the only furniture being a glass table in
the centre, with a skull full of violets.’
Some of the preciousness remains,
though steadily diminishing as the writer
matures, but criticism of his picture of
twentieth - century English society is
likely to be directed rather at the society
than the artist.

TEENAGER
By NEIL MILLAR
BENEATH the street-lamp
on the corner stand a
group of tired people,
waiting to go home.
They are drooping a little,
patient and still. Behind them
in the shadows rears Chauncey
Mannering De Vere, proud
scion of a race of ancient
lineage. Tall he is, slender and
mysterious. His face is youthful,
but his eyes are deep with
unfathomable melancholy.
Upon his clearcut features hangs
an austere expression: stem, but
compassionate. He is a poet.
Going home from night-school.
With clang of bell and rumble
of steel a tram grinds to a halt
before them. The travellers step
out into the roadway and begin
to climb on. High heels ring
on the footpath, and a woman
appears, running awkwardly.
She carries a suitcase in each
hand, and is about to mount the
tram-step, but she must put one
of the cases down in order to do
so. With the grace of a panther
De Vere springs to her rescue.
“Allow me to assist you,”
he offers courteously. The
astonished lady inspects the
young aristocrat, then surrenders
a portmanteau to him. The
steely muscles of his long,
slender fingers and arms are
taken unawares by the weight
of the luggage, but he manages
to heave it up to her. The lady
smiles. De Vere’s face resumes
its stern, compassionate expres-
sion. There is a clang and a
jerk, a lurching of passengers
and the tram groans off.
Lost in knightly reverie, the
poet remains standing in the
street, till the vulgar blare of a
motor-horn at his elbow arouses
him. He springs convulsively
forward, dodges the car (which
is now stationary and filled with
derisive laughter) and crosses the
street. With raking strides he
marches along the opposite foot-
path. Was he startled by the
car horn? Is he walking so fast
to disguise his momentary
alarm, or even to pretend that
his first few leaps are his normal
walking-pace? Not at all. Who
knows what matters of grave
moment may wait on him? He
bends his arm at a graceful
angle and glances keenly at his
wrist-watch, although he fails to
notice the time. With a tireless
pace he stalks over the flag-
stones,
HE rounds the bend at the
intersection and slows down
to a stroll. Here is a bookshop,
its windows lit up, brave with a
finery of dust-jackets, glorious
with titles of ineffable promise,
bewitching with the glamor of
print. In such settings as this
will appear (one day) a slim
volume in purple calf, entitled in
letters of gold: Poems, by
Chauncey Mannering De Vere.
Later, perhaps, there may be
gorgeous novels: C. Mannering
De Vere’s Rhapsody in Blue
Tigers (surrealist) or C. M. De
Vere’s The Gods Chuckle (a
tragedy) or even De Vere’s
famous comedy of manners Till
Death Do Us Fart. These are
juicy titles, hinting at fine prose
subtly illumined with a cynical
sophistication. The poet stands
long before the enchanted
window. Then he looks at his
wrist-watch again, and moves on.
Once more he stalks the
canopied footpaths, tunnels of
light through the thick winter
evening. His face is set again in
sternness and compassion. His
eyes are melancholy, unfathom-
able. Cloaked in the dark aura
of high romance he returns to
his tram-stop, and envelopes
himself in the shadow. Tall and
inscrutable he stands waiting—
for what? It is a mystery.
A very tired gentleman
staggers laboriously past him,
muttering angrily to himself. By
and by a lady comes swaying.
She is comely in a fur boa. Is
it silver-fox from the Arctic
wastes, or mink, or lapin from
a wide, brown land?
The lady is slender, and very,
very graceful. Her cheeks are
as beautiful as the sunset, her
eyebrows delicately arched. As
she wanders past something falls
like a puff of mist upon the
pavement. It is her handkerchief.
OUT from the shadows
springs De Vere, reverently
gathers the fragrant trifle from
the concrete, and strides after the
lovely owner. Hearing his foot-
steps, she drifts to a halt. The
poet, stern-faced but compas-
sionate, soothes her fears.
“Don’t be alarmed. Madam,”
he says gently. “You dropped
your handkerchief. Allow me.”
With a slight bow he holds it out.
The timid lady is still startled.
She parts her petal lips to speak,
looks closely at De Vere and
seems for a moment nonplussed.
“Thanks,” she says at last,
kindly. “I thought you were
older. You’re a good kid. Come
from a good home, hmm?”
Now it is the poet’s turn to be
surprised. “Well, yes”
“I thought so.” She sighs
deeply, filling the air with the
perfume of violets and old
grapes, and with the implication
of tragedy stoically endured.
“Oh, well,” she mourns, “I’ll be
getting along.”
“If I can be of any further
service”
The lady turns quickly, and
kisses the astonished young man
on the cheek. “Good-night,
son,” she says quietly. “You’re
a gentleman. Now wipe that lip-
stick off before you get home.”
f* HAUNCEY MANNERING
DE VERE looks after the
elegant figure silhouetted against
the light of the next corner.
Surely her handkerchief hasn’t
fallen again! Can that be a
man stepping from the distant
shadow, that sinister shape?
Here is a mystery!
A bus comes purring. Hastily
rubbing his cheek, the poet
swings aboard. In half an hour
he is home.
In the kitchen is his mother,
ironing. “Your tea’s in the oven,
dear,” she says by way of greet-
ing. “You’ll have to help
yourself tonight.”
“Right-oh, Mum.”
He pads softly to the room
where his brothers are already
asleep. Sorting through the toys,
clothes, boxing-gloves and other
gear on the floor, he uncovers a
battered rabble of romantic
novels. He selects one and tip-
toes back to the kitchen. Here
he sets his meal before him,
props the book open against the

TEST OF EFFICIENCY.
Treasurer Fadden is off to London
for the Imperial financial confer-
ence on the problems set by rearma-
ment and the special difficulties newly
arisen of the sterling area. The nature
and volume of Australian imports, under
plans to relieve the shortages of home
production in essential goods as well as
to maintain the flow of overseas invest-
ment, will obviously depend upon
decisions by the conference affecting the
Commonwealth as a whole. It will be
supplemental to the recent Imperial
defence talks, and for the coming year
rearmament plans will undoubtedly set
the course in our industrial way of life.
Before the Treasurer left for London
the special Loan Council meeting pro-
vided an opportunity for clearing the air
—in camera, of course, but the main
purpose could be fairly deduced. If the
business was merely to inform the State
Premiers that there could be no relenting
in the curtailing of their loan pro-
grammes, or to impress upon them once
again that there could be no Common-
wealth guarantee, from taxation, of extra
works-money during a second financial
year, there could have been no point in
holding the meeting. Some people who
had been thinking of the credit-restrictions
simply as anti-inflation measures, for-
getting rearmament blueprints, jumped
to the conclusion that the Menzies Gov-
ernment was going to ease the difficulties
as a sort of Christmas-present to industry
generally. That was not so. The Prime
Minister promptly and emphatically
denied that the Government was weaken-
ing in its policy.
But the State Premiers did have one
pressing question to put. It has become
known that early in the new year the
Government’s plans for industrial pro-
duction under the Defence Preparations
Act will be announced. The State Gov-
ernments and business interests have
been gravely anxious about the non-
appearance of expected Government
orders to keep essential industries
going when the credit-restrictions have
stopped their normal commercial
customers buying. It was no answer to
inquiries that blueprints for Government
programmes would be “ready in due
course.” The States’ pressing question
was —When?
It is reasonable to suppose that they
got the answer, and business organisa-
tions, manufacturing and importing alike,
are aware that finality in the Govern-
ment’s plans awaits conclusion of the
London conference. That is natural
enough, and in the interim it is being
made clear from authoritative quarters
that the Government contracts expected
will be financed from taxation and public
loan, aided so far as possible by overseas
loans; that the cost of rearmament and
stockpiling, short of war breaking out,
will not be met by bank credits;
and that the industries which are to
receive priority in consideration as
“essential” for national purposes must
justify that ranking by making themselves
efficient in combating rising prices. That
means improved management and in-
creased man-hour production.
The onus is on Australian industry on
three clear counts —the urgency of the
rearmament programme, the necessity to
combat inflation, and the approaching
day of restored competition from German
and Japanese industry. As the Tariff
Board has pointed out, rising costs in
Australia are a threat to Australian manu-
facturers, but they are also a challenge.
The Commonwealth Government is in-
tent on pressing home that challenge.
Taking first things first, essential
industry has got to produce more
coal, more steel, more cement, or
the whole momentum generated in
this country during and since the
late war will come to a stop through
running out of fuel. That will be fatal
to everybody, and not merely to a Gov-
ernment whose leadership would thus
have been rejected. Basic transport, the
national railways, can be restored to
healthy function only if the coal and steel
industries are enabled to produce their
maximum potential output.
Any day now somebody will announce
that 1951 has been the best N.S.W. coal-
year on record. If that prove so, it
will be to the credit entirely of supple-
mentary open-cut workings. Under-
ground mining had by December 8 lost
over 1,770,000 tons this year through
strikes, or some 400,000 more tons lost
that last year. When the coal for which
this country is starving can be got by
mechanical extraction of pillar-coal,
further delay in that operation is intoler-
able. Probably in the last resort efficiency
of industry and the beating of high costs
depends upon coal more than upon any
other single factor.
That apart, the Tariff Board’s report
for 1950-51 makes a highly interesting
commentary upon the industrial scene
and. by way of intelligent anticipation
perhaps, upon the reactions of many
employers to the Government’s general
ban of further living on inflation. The
board’s report must have greatly fortified
Treasurer Fadden in the framing of his
“unpopular” Budget.
The report makes clear that following
the line of least resistance is now taboo.
It joins with the Arbitration Court and
the governor of the Commonwealth Bank
in blaming upon many employers the
boosting of wages through their bidding
against each other for scarce labor. As
for the general structure of industry, the
“lack of balance in the pattern” through
the expansion of luxury industries at the
expense of those supplying basic needs
must be corrected. But the basic indus-
tries, too, have got to be keyed up, and
the starting-points are more coal, in-
creased efficiency of management and
improved employer-employee relations.
The report states that, so far as the
board can, it means to police the call for
greater efficiency.
It will continue to recommend to the
Government adequate protection to those
industries which can demonstrate effi-
ciency.... (but) it will apply more
stringent tests of efficiency and value to
the community....
Even in the face of a further decline in
the competitive cost position, the board
considers it would be unwise to give a
guarantee to industry that protection will
be increased to offset that deterioration.
Anything which tends to remove from
manufacturers the responsibility for an
all-out attack on costs should be avoided.
It produces a picture (from its own
viewpoint) of some of the vested interests
in inflation:
Applicants for protection have asked for
higher rates of duty than are actually
needed in order to provide protection
against possible future increases in costs.
Records disclose a marked difference in
the attitude of manufacturers towards in-
creasing costs in the post-war years.
There are those who have achieved remark-
able improvement in efficiency and have
held costs per unit of production constant
despite rapid increase in wage-rates....
There are others who regard rising costs
as inevitable and seek to recover them by
increasing prices to the consumer.
The lack of active competition and exist-
ing shortages often enable profits to be
made even where increased costs are
treated passively. The board cannot be
expected to be sympathetic to those who
seek protection to cover inefficiency.
Distribution margins are excessive.
Manufacturers have pleaded that dis-
tributors generally receive the same per-
centage on local manufactures and im-
ported goods, and that if margins on Aus-
tralian goods are lower distributors con-
centrate on selling imported goods.
The board is not impressed with
the complacent attitude which regards
U.K. production as the main com-
petitor to be met and the state of
efficiency in U.K. industry as “a suitable
yardstick” for the measurement of effi-
ciency in Australia. For one thing, there
is serious concern expressed in U.K. at
the manner in which gains in efficiency in
that country are being outstripped in
U.S.A., and for another the rate of im-
provement in overall efficiency in Aus-
tralia is lower than that in U.K. anyway.
Since Britain is anxious about efficiency
in face of the coming bid for markets
by Germany and Japan, Australia ought
therefore to be still more anxious; but
that does not appear to be the case.
If Australians do not yet understand
that the present credit restrictions are a
necessary medicine for a serious internal
disorder, and only the first dose, then the
trials awaiting them will come very hard
indeed.
Tradition and Recruiting.
Australian local defence is roughly 151
years old. Though the Marines and the
New South Wales Corps existed before
1800 as permanent forces, part of the
British Army, it was only when Irish
rebellion was threatened by the exported
heroes of Vinegar Hill and others that
the Loyal Association came into brief
existence. It died quickly, and was re-
placed by a new Loyal Corps in 1804,
just in time for the Castle Hill rebellion
in which it saw some service which left
its bayonets unbloodied and its heads un-
bowed. The first Australian-born to
enlist in the British Army in the King’s
Own Scottish Borderers was Thos. Stubbs.
From the arrival of the first British
Line regiment, the 73rd, in 1809, a
Veteran Corps came into existence and
in it old soldiers served on a reserve.
Retired officers of the Regular regiments
led them. Their headquarters was at
Parramatta, the oldest town in Australia
outside Sydney, Today it is the head-
quarters also of our oldest cavalry regi-
ment, which dates back only to 1885, and
in token of the year of its birth owns as
a badge the crest of the then Governor
of New South Wales, Lord Carrington.
There were, of course, sporadic
attempts to organise volunteer regiments
of rifles, mounted and otherwise, from
the time of the Crimea onwards, but very
few permanent units resulted, though in
the ’sixties the volunteers had a great
vogue, and public men (with and without
corporations) vied with each other for
commissions. Some vestiges of the in-
fantry volunteer army of those days re-
main in the First Battalion, N. S. Wales,
the 22nd Battalion, Victoria, and some
other units in S. Australia and in Queens-
land, where there was a troop of mounted
rifles.
All through 151 years pioneer families
have maintained, generation after genera-
tion, a connection with defence that began
originally in the ranks and messes of
the British regiments which garrisoned
the Territory of New South Wales. The
longest-standing and most distinguished
throughout history of these are the
Macarthurs —and Macarthur - Onslows,
their successors in the female line. John
Macarthur arrived in the Neptune in
June, 1790, bringing with him his baby
son-in-arms, who was to become later
Sir Edward Macarthur. He was near
enough to being born an Australia to be
claimed as native. And he was the first
man who claimed to be an Australian
actually to volunteer for active service in
any real war.
Sent to England as the emissary of the
rebels of 1808, he landed in London to
find the country seething with excitement
at the news of Arthur Wellesley’s victory
at Vimiero and of the prospects
of aggressive war on the Peninsula.
It was natural in one whose great-
grandfather had fought at Culloden,
and there lost all his sons save
one, to find himself “burning to be there.”
There he was soon in the 39th Regiment.
He became a battle veteran, a lieutenant-
general and ultimately commander-in-
chief of the British forces in Australia,
and our first local military knight. Six
generations of the Macarthur and Mac-
arthur-Onslow family have given distin-
guished service in the regular and
volunteer forces of Australia.
On December 10, when the N. S. Wales
Lancers celebrated certain events at
Parramatta, Brigadier Denzil Macarthur-
Onslow was there as commander of the
Armored Brigade, and his son was on
parade in subaltern’s uniform as the sixth-
generation representative of the clan.
The commander of the Second Division
—Major-General Victor Windeyer—who
was also present and whose name is
linked with the gallantries of Tobruk,
could claim military association dating
back nearly a century, for his grandfather
held a captain’s commission in the Sydney
Volunteers at the end of the ’fifties.
The N. S. Wales Lancers have a history
typical of great units which have kept
the spirit of defence alive in Australia
through thick and thin for more than 60
years—others there are in the infantry
such as the Scottish regiments, the St.
George regiment and the battalions
sprung from the Moretons. The Lancers
began as the Sydney Light Horse, but
were converted to cavalry at the end of
their first year. Parramatta became their
hub, Colonel Burns, of Burns Philp, and
the late Sir John Sulman, who held a
subaltern’s commission, their leading
patrons in the early ’nineties. They
owned a magnificent mounted band pro-
vided entirely by the subscriptions of
their officers. Officers and men bought
their own uniforms at £6O and £lO.
In 1893 they sent a detachment
to the United Kingdom at their
own expense, and won sword and lance
and equestrian competitions against the
crack regulars of the Empire. They
also sent a detachment to Queen Victoria’s
jubilee under Captain W. L. Vernon,
whose descendant commands the regi-
ment today. They returned to find
their commander, Colonel Burns,
involved in a plan to give a full squadron
with their own horses six months’ train-
ing with British cavalry at Aldershot.
The regiment raised £3OOO towards the
scheme, the public another £2OOO, the
N. S. Wales Government nothing. The
100 men who went under Captain Charlie
Cox were away longer than they expected.
Most volunteered the moment the S.
African war broke out, and later a total
of seven officers and 165 men went on
active service.
About the time in 1911 when some-
body at the Australian medical confer-
ence assured his hearers that Australians
did not make good soldiers, the Com-
monwealth took oyer the regiment. Its
N. S. Wales entity was divided into three
—lst A.L.H. (continuing to be known as
N.S.W. Lancers), covering Sydney,
Parramatta, the Illawarra and the
Hawkesbury; the 4th A.L.H. (Hunter
River), and the sth in the Northern
Rivers. The record of these regiments in
Palestine and Syria was superb. The Ist
Brigade was now based at the old
barracks at Parramatta, very fittingly, for,
as shown by a tablet unveiled by the
Administrator of the Commonwealth the
other day, it is the oldest military barracli
in Australia,
After World War I the heirs of the old
Lancer regiment went through various
changes, still clinging proudly to their
name and traditions; but after a struggle
with automatic arms they have now
joined the modern cavalry and wear the
black berets of the Armored Brigade,
which is based on their old barracks,
now 131 years old and haunted by the
ghosts of famous British corps such as
the Dorsets, the Leicesters and the 4th
(King’s Own), the Gloucester and the
57th Middlesex (Diehards), whose suc-
cessors have been fighting desperate
battles in Korea shoulder to shoulder
with the men of our own Royal
Australian Regiment.
While compulsory national service has
turned out a splendid nucleus of civilian
soldiers, and hundreds of officers who
served throughout World War II are
giving their time and money to building
up the volunteer forces, it seems a pity
that traditions and associations have been
broken away from to a large extent.
The need of Australia for serving
defenders is becoming acute. Such a
shortage of young officers exists that the
Regular Army could absorb four times
the number graduating from Duntroon.
The same shortages exist in n.c.o. ranks.
The Korean war continues, and the
Services departments are now calling for
an immediate expansion of 25 per cent,
to meet a world situation in which the
British Parliament has just passed a bill to
reconstitute the Home Guard. Consider-
able local patriotic effort will be needed
to help recruiting next year. It has be-
come a vital need to keep Regular,
national and volunteer forces at maxi-
mum strength.
EK DUM.
Eris O'Brien on Quinn.
[Here, somewhat condensed, is the
text of Archbishop Eris O'Brien’s
oration at the unveiling of the head-
stone over Rod Quinn’s grave at
Waverley Cemetery, Sydney .]
No place more appropriate than
Waverley Cemetery could have been
selected for this gathering, not only
because it gives us opportunity to inspect
the fine memorial which citizens have set
above a poet’s grave, but also because
its environment is eloquent of Australian
genius and patriotism.
Turn hut your gaze and see the graves
of men who in their days attained high
distinction in the fields of Australian
politics, literature and art. Merely to
mention their names is like rapidly turn-
ing over the pages of a many-volumed
history of our land. Here is Deniehy,
the fiery idealist who was never sure
whether he was destined to be a poli-
tician or a satirical pamphleteer. There
is Dailey, the exquisite Premier who was
distracted from politics by his cultivated
taste for classical literature. And there,
beyond, is Archibald, that grand patron
of uninfluential men with ambitions to
write, who provided the opportunity for
them to publish their works and inci-
dentally and legitimately profited by their
industry.
Also, here, in the “God’s acre,” are
several of the makers —they might well
be called creators —of Australian song.
They are sufficiently numerous to con-
stitute a choir, and indeed, a competent
musician could so combine their varied
literary ways and themes that their full
charms would not be discordant.
Kendall sedately lyrical in his “songs
of stream and forest-wind, tones of wave
and harp-like tree.” Quinn, with his
broader lyricism, measured and colored
by his predilection for the waters of
rivers and seas, where “tides gently fall-
ing make soft liquid noises.” Daley, a
singer more expert and delicate and wider
in range, gambolling in the way of a
flute among them all in “lyrics delicate
as lilac-scent, soft idylls woven of wind
and flower and stream, and songs and
sonnets carven in fine gold.”
And also here is Lawson, who is so
much more difficult to fit into this lyrical
choir that if I try to do it the attempt
may work havoc on the metaphor.
Nevertheless, though Lawson’s real claim
to fame rests on prose rather than on
verse, his sturdy realistic songs, in which
“hobble-chains and camp-ware keep
jingling to the tune,” must be reckoned


as an appropriate atmospheric accompani-
Sent to any chorus that undertakes to
sing about Australia.
Though Quinn relished the fresh white-
ness of Waverley and its “soft sounds
creeping o’er the waves,” he resented its
loneliness and became disillusioned by
evidences that “never more come man
or maid” to it to pay tribute to its illus-
trious dead. Seated on the kerb of
Daley’s grave he recited that poet s harsh
indictment: “Fair romance is dead and
in her cold grave lying. And do they
deem, those fools supreme, whose iron-
wheels unceasing whirr, that in this rush-
ing age of steam there is no room for
her?”
That is an old and familiar complaint,
found in every age of every nation’s
literary history. To what extent is it true
in Australia?
Let us consider first whether the poets
themselves disregard the singers of the
past. Now, it is obvious that much
modern Australian verse is readily distin-
guishable from that of earlier periods.
In its newer forms it merely reveals a
normal development of the art of poetry,
responding to the changing outlooks and
problems of the age in which it seeks to
express itself. Fundamentally it is built
upon all the poetic industry of the past,
and even in its highest forms of expres-
sion, as, for instance, when it is practised
by a McCrae or a Neilson or a Slessor
or a Fitz Gerald, it never fails to recognise
at least some degree of indebtedness to
the patterns set by singers such as Daley
and Quinn.
There is no need to make a specialised
research to find striking relationships
between the writings of both ages. When
Quinn fashioned that fine poem, “The
Fisher,” he walked where you would
expect to find him, along the sea-fringes
of beaches, and made this line: On
velvet moved the silky, sucking tide.
Here, concentrated within seven of the
simplest words in our language, are
vastness, calm, color, action and sound,
and even silence. “On velvet moved the
silky, sucking tide.” I have always liked
that line, and consequently I hearken
back to it whenever I read Kenneth
Slessor’s rich metaphor of beaches
milked by suck-mouthed tides, foaming
with ropes of bubbles.” Both are superb,
even though the modern, as being more
developed, is the stronger of the two.
The poets of the present, as Quinn’s
illustrious friend, E. J- Brady, has
observed today, are not oblivious of the
craftsmen who went before them.
I fear, however, that this cannot be
said about the general public. Many years
ago the people, and even children, were
accustomed to read Australian poetry and
could recite much of it from memory.
Fewer can do that now, which is regret-
table, because a people who cannot sing
their own songs will never feel the urge,
or learn how, to make their own songs.
Rather the people will begin to believe,
and perhaps they are already begun to
believe, that the whining, fatuous and
degenerate imported concoctions which
now cram the programmes of the com-
mercial broadcasting stations in parti-
cular are an appropriate expression of
Australian judgments about what our
verse and music ought to be.
That situation can be rectified only
by a deliberate and laborious counter-
effort, which, I believe, should be first
attempted, and then concentrated, within
our schools. In these schools, much
against the inclinations of teachers, but
in conformity with the dictates of our
commercialised age, a false emphasis has
had to be placed upon the utilitarian
aspect of education. Such a regime has
tended to dull men’s perceptiyeness of the
beauty that is in created things ; it has
checked his imagination and frustrated
his idealism, and quenched his natural
inclinations to write in verse or prose.
Therefore, and because all the ages of
civilisation indicate that these normal and
commendable functions and attitudes of
human beings—imagination, appreciation
of the good and the beautiful and
idealism —are stimulated by poets and
poetry, it seems desirable that poets and
poetry should be exploited to the fullest
extent within the schools, where our
citizens are fashioned.
Quinn was not a “Csesar” in Australian
life or letters. But he was a splendid
craftsman who never lowered the true
standards or functions of poetry by be-
coming vulgar or cheap or merely propa-
gandist. He pursued his uneventful life
writing songs because he had to, both
because he could not express his feelings
and impressions except in song, and be-
cause singing was the only trade in which
he was competent. But, over and above
those motives for writing, he continued
to write because the common people
appreciated what he wrote.
PLAIN ENGLISH
Britain and Germany.
“Drawing a sponge across the past,
as he said, Dr. Konrad Adenauer, Chan-
cellor of the (West) German Federal
Republic, has been to London,
come to “full agreement” with Mr.
Churchill “on all questions affecting the
future shape of Europe,” and been re-
ceived in extended audience by the King.
There was some mild grumbling in
England about the Palace visit, but the
sincerity of Dr. Adenauer has never been
in question. He somehow preserved his
life in retirement in Hitler’s Germany,
after dismissal in Hitler’s early days from
office as Mayor of Cologne, and survived
two imprisonments by the Nazis, once in
1933 and again in 1944, the turbulent
year in Germany of the attack on Hitler s
life. He emerged after hostilities head
of the Christian Democrat party, the
obvious figure on which the Allies could
negotiate the resuscitation of an inde-
pendent Germany in a society of
peaceful nations.
Not in this century, save for the brief
feverish period of conciliation under
Stresemann in the mid-’twenties, has there
been such a close and active collabora-
tion between the Governments of Britain,
France and a Germany truncated, it is
true, but embracing a population and an
industrial plant roughly equal to Britain s.
The return of Mr. Churchill to power in
Whitehall has greatly cleared the
atmosphere in which the plans for col-
laboration had hitherto been discussed.
The Schuman plan, for instance, pro-
posed by France for international
management of the Ruhr coal resources,
linking French, Belgian and German
heavy industry, is now ratified by the
Paris Chamber of Deputies, and the
Senate’s endorsement is expected as a
matter of course. If Dr. Adenauer was
one of those who sided with French and
Belgian protests against Britain’s refusal
to link her own coal and steel industries
with the Continental merger, he would
appear now to have accepted from Mr.
Churchill the reasons for Britain’s non-
participation in a plan which the British
Government heartily endorses for the
States across the Channel.
Other objections voiced by the
Churchill Ministry against participation
in a European army have been well
ventilated. It is the Americans chiefly
who still fail to recognise the conditions
which historically have always forbidden,
and practically still forbid, Britain to
throw into the building-up of a
large army her national resources for any
united European defence effort. Her
concern with air- and sea-power, each
based on the fundamental considerations
which have ruled British defence policy
for centuries, is an old familiar story
among her European neighbors.
Adenauer wants naturally to see
Germany reunited, but he knows
that in present conditions elections
embracing both East and West
Germany for a common govern-
ment would bring to power on a
Russian-zone vote the Socialists under
Schumacher, who would undo most of
Adenauer’s work for co-operation within
the Western European Union. And that
is what Russia ardently desires.
"On a War Basis. 11
The decision of the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment to place its R.A.A.F. squadrons
abroad on a “war footing” and enlist
officers and men accordingly must have
occasioned a little amazement in the
jungle and snows of the north.
The fighter squadron in Korea (the
77th), a veteran outfit of 8.C.0.F., has
been fighting earnestly almost since
the Korean war began. They are
engaged in operations which, overall, are
larger than the decisive campaign in
World War II in North Africa. They
had their C.O. killed nearly a year ago.
They have seen the first commander of
the Royal Australian Regiment, which
they support, killed in action and his suc-
cessor sent back to Australia to train a
new battalion to increase our strength in
the field.
The 77th Squadron has had, and is
having, rather a bad time with its
Mustangs and Meteor jets, though not
so bad as reported in the sensational
Press, thanks to the skill and experience
of its officers and men. Its troubles are
the result of the existence of a superior
Russian fighter, the M.I.G. of various
marks. And Russia has the M.I.G. be-
cause at a time when the Kremlin was
protesting that it proposed to attain peace
for the world by means of a world revo-
lution which would smash imperialist
countries like Britain, the flatulent Attlee
Government, with the full approval of
the Australian “Labor” party, handed the
Russians some Rolls-Royce Nene engines.
Britain’s advantages in the air field
have been given away as far as a
Socialist Government could give them
away, and the British people are now
taking payment for their generosity in
graves. Even the Egyptians were given
up-to-date British weapons and aeroplane
engines.
However, the point has been reached,
after the Allies have had 250,000 casual-
ties or more in Korea, and Malaya has
been turned into a national edition of
Mass Murder Incorporated, where the
dreaming Governments are actually be-
ginning to realise that what they are
engaged in is war and not some activity
invented by U.N.O.
The Yearly Frenzy.
There’s some sort of a national lesson
to be learned from the fact that whereas
the national income this year is around
£3lOl million, giving every man, woman
and child of the 8,000,000 population
an average of roughly £387 each, the
wife will get only a pair this year whereas
we gave her two last year and there 11
be a lot less poultry eaten this time. Yet
last year the national income was only
about £2300 million, or about £287 a head.
This, of course, is only another way of
saying that the quid isn’t what it used
to be. It is, too, another tack in the
coffin of Socialism, since it proves that
despite the theories and practice of
Socialism, money still retains its old dis-
ability to distribute.
However, so potent is the influence of
Christmas that money actually does dis-
tribute for a week or two —or at least
we distribute it as freely as though we
owned most of the national income our-
selves. And even if it isn’t spent on
poultry, it’s spent on something else, to
the great joy of the retail trade and the
makers of toys, knick-knacks, artificial
jewellery and supplies of blackmarket
bottled beer.
It’s a reckless and ruthless business, this
Christmas shopping. We set out deter-
mined not to spend more than a fixed
sum, find that it won’t cover everybody,
go a little more here and there, and finally
let our heads go. Grandma already has
more hankies than she can use ; ruthlessly
we press another half-dozen on her. The
wife’s brother, a pain in the neck to us
all the year, gets one himself in the tie
we thrust on him. We curse the P.M.G.
over the size of the telephone bill and
somehow find ss. for the postman.
Well, there it is. The same frenzy
infects us every year. In war and drought,
in good times and bad, Christmas comes
with December and, for a period at least,
our hearts are lighter for it. So are our
pockets; but it is no small part of the
general excitement that, for the moment,
we can forget our pockets.
WHAT Expenses?
Until three years ago New South Wales
Legislative Councillors were unpaid and,
technically, they probably still are. As
the N. S. Wales Government Statistician
puts it in his Official Year Book : “Until
the Constitution Amendment (Legislative
Council Members’ Allowances) Act, 1948,
the services of members were rendered
without remuneration or reimbursement,
but by that Act members.... are entitled
to receive by way of reimbursement of
expenses an allowance at the rate of £3OO
per annum.”
Clearly this £3OO a year is not re-
muneration or salary ; it is reimbursement
of expenses deemed to have been incurred
by the M.L.C. in the course of his duties
on the Council. He must have incurred
the expenses, otherwise how could he be
reimbursed? Money must be disbursed
before the disburser can be reimbursed
and no-one but the disburser can be re-
imbursed. Unfortunately the Statistician
does not say what expenses the reimburse-
ment is intended to cover. They can’t be
living expenses ; a Legislative Councillor s
private life is a thing apart from his
function as part of the legislature, and
how or whether he eats, drinks, weds
and feeds and clothes his children is no
concern of the N. S. Wales Constitution.
They can’t include travelling expenses;
his gold pass should look after that item.
Members of the Lower House plead
that they are put to considerable expense
in “nursing” their electorates —in subscrib-
ing to charitable and sporting bodies, in
listening to and inquiring into grievances,
in seeing that wrongs are righted and
rights upheld—but Legislative Councillors
are not put to this bother. The votes
that get them into Parliament come not
from the general public but from other
members of the two Houses—in reality,
from their own political party —so it
would be not only absurd but almost
libellous to suggest that any expense
attaches either to their original election
or to their prospects of holding their seat.
The mystery is deepened by the fact
that in the brief space of three years
since the reimbursement principle was
first accepted these expenses have grown
by £2OO a year, as is proved by
a bill introduced last week to increase
the amount of reimbursement to £5OO.
Certainly the cost of living has risen con-
siderably since 1948, but it has been
shown that living costs have nothing
to do with these expenses. There is,
however, a clue in that increase; the
reimbursements obviously cover items
which have increased in price by 66f p.c.
since September, 1948. Apart from that
the mystery is as far as ever from being
solved.
Admittedly the Government Statistician
is one of the busiest men in the public
service, and the Official Year Book is
only one of his many responsibilities ;
but if he doesn’t throw a little more light
on those “reimbursements” in the next
issue of his admirable handbook he will
have only himself to blame if the
reviewers slam him hard.
Dominie's Lament.
Maitland High School headmaster, as
reported, dreeing his weird at the local
Christmas breaking-up function:
Australians will remain a backward people
and live in a moral jungle until they, take
an active, informed, critical and intelligent
interest in education.
Sometimes, in moments of frustration, I
almost doubt the practical wisdom of foster-
ing ideals in youngsters. It is a mad world,
ruthless, greedy and materialistic, which
looks with contempt on an honest man and
spurns him as a sentimental fool.
Would it not be better for the material
well-being of children to educate them in
all the devious ways to flout the law —the
ruthless technique of blackmarkets, the
sinister arts of horse-doping, the dark
intrigues of liquor-licensing, the practice of
faking news and perverting the truth, and
the science of ballot-rigging? Should
they not be taught the ugly gospel of class-
hatred and inoculated against the rash desire
to do an honest day’s work?
If he talked in school to the kids like
that . . . but he could not have done ; it
would have been clean over their heads.
There is only one class-hatred they know ;
and while the Teachers’ Federation some-
how maintains constantly in office a Com-
munist as chief executive, yet the Mait-
land High School boys cannot be sup-
posed to know anything about ballot-
rigging. Their head was, of course,
throwing off at the adult population of
the “moral jungle,” including his audience
of parents.
Probably they one and all sat through
the gentleman’s address in the stony
silence of the Stone Age man and won-
dered what was biting him.
The Ironworkers' War.
Mr. Justice Dunphy having found that
the general-secretary, now a Communist
employee in a hostile country, of the
Federated Ironworkers’ Association had
been elected through barefaced and
wholesale forgery and fraud, there was
no sign of revulsion from the Federal
controllers of the union. They are
merely concerned, by fair means or foul,
to continue to benefit by the forgeries
and other crookedness proven before the
judge and to continue their —and
Moscow’s —control of the union and its
finances. They treated the new general-
secretary, Mr. Short, rightly elected on
the votes of the majority of the union, as
if he were the culprit, barring him from
his rights in every way possible.
When elections for the State branches
placed most of these in the hands of the
A.L.P., they were unmoved by this ex-
pression of rank-and-file opinion. Pend-
ing new elections they still held control
of the National Conference, a body
modelled on the Central Committee of
the Communist party and empowered to
make rules. This Communist-packed
iniquity has only a week or so of life left
before it goes out of office —it consists
of 26 members. But it met last Friday,
sacked Mr. Short and altered the rules
to abolish control by the National Con-
ference of 26 members and make the
governing body of the union a convention
of 120 to 140 delegates, which will cost
£5OOO of the union members’ money to
call together and which the Communists
hope to be able to swamp with
their own agents whenever it is called
together. Mr. Short was sacked on the
ground that the circumstances of his
appointment had “divided and will weaken
the union, thus rendering it less capable
of protecting and advancing the interests
of members”—which have never mattered

twopence to the Communist gang who
manage their affairs.
The Federal elections of the union are
about to be held on the basis of a fair
ballot properly conducted under official
supervision to protect members from the
effects of fraud, and on the result, on the
branch ballots, seems to be a foregone
conclusion. But the remarkable fact
about the whole unsavory affair is the
silence of Dr. Evatt and Mr. Ferguson,
of the A.L.P. Dr. Evatt is vocal about
the injustices done to Mr. Barnes, the
cricketer, who is supposedly not getting
a fair trial from bodies controlling the
game, but he has very little to say
about the staggering situation which has
revealed itself in the Federated Iron-
workers’ Association set-up.
POLITICAL POINTS
Just a year ago the McGrrrrr issued a
hnstmas message of good cheer to the
N; S '3 les ’ tellin S them they
were witnessing the dawn of a new era.”
Believing himself, he burbled on:
a r W^ der / ul Christmas we are
L °ok where you will there is
prosperity and happiness. It is not just a
s P ure S 1 Se ‘ ? is real and s °h d - lam
sure it will continue.
s not so sure. He’s afraid the
phase has already passed ; he doubts its
reality and solidity. In short, he is
prophesying “a vast army of unemployed
early next year.”
When he made his fatuous statement
last Christmas the New South Wales
remier left no doubt that he thought
tns Government deserved great credit for
the mirage of prosperity he imagined he
saw, but he is not claiming any blame for
, e vista he is now surveying. That is
all the fault of the Menzies Government
for cutting loan allocations”—the “cut”
was in the amount McGrrrrr asked for,
not in the amount he got last year.
his blood-brother south of the
horde., Queensland’s Acting - Premier
Gair has been howling to high Heaven
at the iniquity of the Federal Govern-
ment in not giving him all he asked in
the way of loan-money. He accused
Canberra of having a secret agreement
the banks and other lending
authorities to tighten finance, and said
that if such an agreement did not exist
then it must be that lenders had lost
confidence in the Menzies Government,
as the Chifley Government’s loans had
all, with one exception, been over-
subscribed. Fadden’s reply was that
Gair’s statement was irresponsible and
astounding, and he quoted figures to show
how borrowings had increased since the
last year of the Chifley regime. Loans
raised in 1948-49 totalled £96 million ;
in 1950-51 the figure was £233 million
and for the current year £225 million.
Queensland’s share in the same period
had increased from million to
£26? million.
Last week the Egyptians took the
horrible step of handing out machine-
guns (British Stem, apparently) to any
civilians who wished to use them against
the British. They also called for a Holy
War against these “aggressive British
wild beasts.” Somebody derailed a train,
blew up an R.A.F. radio mast. In
Cairo the Government declared a state
of emergency and stationed riot squads
to prevent student demonstrations. From
the Administration that has restored the
property of the terrorist Moslem Brother-
hood (which is urging that it is the duty
of every Moslem man and woman to
fight the invader in any Moslem land) this
is a champion piece of hypocrisy.
Albert Monk, back from his latest
oversea jaunt, has entered the prophecy
business. Churchill’s Government, be-
cause of its economic policy, will “not
last very long.” After it is defeated
Labor will be in office “for at least 20
years,” and this will be “the end of the
Tories politically.” Calwell, back in
1946, crowed that Federal “Labor,” would
remain in power for 20 years ; it was
out in three. A decade earlier Hitler
prophesied that the Nazi regime would
last 1000 years. It’s a risky game, Albert.
In June, 1947, New South Wales
M.L.As. were being paid at the rate of
£875 a year. In July that year they
voted themselves a £5OO rise; and last
week they upped it another £5OO. N. S.
Wales Assemblymen being honest and
conscientious gentlemen, this means that
they believe they are now giving the State
a thousand-pounds’-worth more service
a year than they were years ago.
Any N. S. Wales elector agreeing with
them is invited to send his reasons to
The Bulletin. Politicians, their families
and creditors are barred from the
invitation.
Much stress is laid by Parliamentarians
on the amount of work they do for their
constituents. It would be interesting to
know how much of this is really neces-
sary. There is a limit to what an elector
is entitled to expect of his representative,
and members should have the courage to
say as much to barrow-pushers and pro-
fessional nuisances. Some members go
out of their way looking for this type
of “work,” even to the extent of adver-
tising in local papers or on hotel notice-
boards issuing a free invitation to “bring
your problems to your local member.”
In the salary-grab debate Liberal H. B.
Turner was reported as saying that
members had to pay their hotel expenses
during Federal election and referendum
campaigns. That is probably so; but
what justification is there for passing
the cost on to the N. S, Wales taxpayer?
Sydney papers featured the joyous
statement of a brewery boss in Victoria
that there’d be “beer in plenty for all
this Christmas.” No such news stirred
the hearts of Sydney topers. However,
all was not lost. Every member of the
250-strong Parliamentary staff in Can-
berra got two dozen bottles —and
Canberra hasn’t even a brewery.
The A.L.P. ban on the Melbourne
publication “News-Weekly” doesn’t seem
to have appalled the producers of the
sheet. Last week a band of huskies with
the sales-cry “Read the truth about the
Ironworkers” were selling it at Sydney’s
King’s Cross, one of the regular stamp-
ing-grounds of sellers of the Communist
“Tribune.” It was selling well, too.
If Mr. Ashkanasy, K.C., has been
correctly reported, he urged the Consti-
tutional Club in Melbourne to oppose
the admission of German migrants on
the ground that they would not become
loyal Australians. He said:
If South Africa leaves the British Empire
it will be because of the solidly anti-British
German section, and if Germans are
allowed tp migrate here in large numbers
the same thing could happen.
As an argument that statement is hardly
worthy of a K.C. The anti-British Ger-
man section in South Africa would have
little influence were it not for the very
much larger anti-British Boer section to
which it has attached itself. No one
advocates bringing Germans here in
sufficient numbers to outweigh the British
element, and past experience has been
that German migrants can be assimilated
into the community better than most
races.
A row between nurses and the
hospital secretary at Wonthaggi (Vic.)
ended when the gentleman apologised,
but not until the town itself was divided
and a few punches had been swapped.
Up spoke the president of the hospital
committee, a Mr. Currie: “I am a Com-
munist, and there is another Communist
on the committee, but we are not pushing
this walkout.” Just as well, perhaps, since
what the nurses bucked about was the
hospital secretary bringing a policeman
to order their boy-friends out of the
lounge in the nurses’ quarters, where they
were being properly entertained.
Puzzle on the industrial front. Certain
employers, finding their stockpiles getting
out of hand and goods not moving out
quite so freely, have reduced hands in
order to cut down production. But they
claim that, in spite of fewer hands, pro-
duction remains at the same level or
actually increases. Yet the A.L.P. has
always objected to more palatable types
of “incentive” systems.
Effrontery is one of the hallmarks of
the Australian Communist, but the latest
action of the Red executive of the Iron-
workers’ Association takes the biggest
bun in the cakeshop. The Arbitration
Court having found its 1949 election of
officers fraudulent, declared industrial-
grouper L. Short national secretary and
ordered fresh court-controlled elections
for other senior posts, the Comrades
found their 15-year reign of lawlessness
dangerously threatened, especially when
returns of branch elections made it clear
that their control of the national execu-
tive would vanish in the New Year.
Their reply was to abolish the executive
altogether, depose Short, and to declare
that control of union affairs was vested
in the national convention, still for the
moment under Red dominance. They
further announced, in defiance of the
court’s order, that elections for top union
jobs should be conducted by the union
itself.
Short is applying to the Arbitration
Court for an order preventing the Reds
from giving effect to these decisions. It
it unthinkable that the court will allow
its findings and orders to be flouted by
a gang of schemers whose object is to
retain their grip on the union at all costs
and by any methods.
Dr. Evatt on the omission of Mr.
Barnes from the cricket Test team:
An opportunity should be given those
concerned to prove or disprove the insinua-
tions and suggestions... .That is the essence
of sportsmanship and justice between man
and man.
Dr. Evatt should tell it to some of the
so-called Australia-First men his Govern-
ment interned on “insinuations and sug-
gestions,” mainly emanating from Com-
munists. Public opinion practically had
to take him by the scruff of the neck to
make him hold an inquiry into file entirely
groundless charges by which some of
them were nearly ruined and as the result
of which one wounded ex-soldier, proved
to be a “King and Empire” man who had
given voluntary military service to his
country for 20 years, died before he was
cleared.
“C.Q.”: Apropos the war now being
waged between carters and private-car
owners for exclusive possession of Mel-
bourne’s street kerbing. A suggestion
made in a report by the London and
Home County Traffic Advisory Council
might be worth trying. It proposed allow-
ing commercial vehicles to use one side
of the streets and private-cars the other.
Every alternate day they were to change
sides.
Before the Coal Tribunal the president
of the Western District Miners’ Federa-
tion said that since the Government
announcement of its decision to close
Glen Davis shale-oil works industrial
relations had improved and output of
crude oil had been trebled. Now what
can have caused that?
State Premiers with slender majorities
have cause to envy Premier Frost, of
Ontario. A few weeks ago he led his
Progressive Conservative party to victory
at a general election which gave him 79
seats in a House of 90. Conservatives
gained six seats from the Liberals and
19 from the Commonwealth Co-ops,—
the equivalent of Labor.
Melbourne “Herald” holds that the
possibility of Treasurer Fadden’s retire-
ment next year is “being widely discussed
by politicians and departmental officials.”
The truth is that overwork has knocked
the Treasurer about and he’s now on his
way to London by sea for an Empire
Finance Ministers’ conference next year.
Funny how the crows pass the word
when a hitherto strong creature falters
ever so little.
Nobody suspected Melbourne wharfies
of a passion for mathematical exactness,
but apparently they have. A shipping tie-
up last week threw several ships idle, and
for a while it looked as if the whole port
would come to a standstill. Reason: A
stevedoring clerk had written a seven
instead of two on a requisition-order,
with the result that a gang was sent to
the wrong wharf.
Having dipped their hands again into
the public till by means of a bill raising
Ministers’ and members’ salaries, the
McGirr Government in N.S.W. evidently
felt its supporters had to get a sop,
and so it declared New Year’s Eve a
public holiday (in effect, a day of double
pay), although a Federal Commissioner
refused it, and in the other States it is an
ordinary working day. Next time McGirr
howls about value not being put back
in the pound he should be reminded of
this fresh example of taking the value
out.
A few more self-awarded rises in screw
and Sir William McKell’s old colleagues
of the N.S.W. “Labor” party will be
getting as much as he is.
Premier McGrrrrr, attempting to
justify his salary grab, said that no
section of the community devoted so
much of its time to the public interest
without additional remuneration as
did members of Parliament. He said
that on December 12. He’ll never again
be able to use that phrase “without
additional remuneration.”
A. G, Warner, a former Minister in
Victoria, has listed pressure-groups which
influence Governments as: Anti- and
pro-liquor interests, gambling groups,
Communists, pensioners, farmer blocs,
public servants, manufacturers, the trade-
union movement. He says that the way
these people lobby, persuade and bully
has to be seen to be believed. Warner’s
experience is confined to Victoria; he’s
lucky.
On January 1 the newly-created N, S.
Wales Electricity Commission will take
over the job of supplying light, power
and blackouts formerly attended to by
the Sydney County Council and other
authorities, including the privately-run
Electric Light and Power Corporation. A
correspondent of the “Sydney Morning
Herald” has suggested that, instead of
complaining of shortage of money for
housing projects, the Government should
postpone the taking-over of the assets of
E.L. and P.C. and devote the £3,000,000
allocated for that purpose to urgent hous-
ing needs. It won’t be done, of course.
Housing can wait; Socialism can’t.

Economic Hesitation
With Christmas approaching,
the sharemarket has again
slackened. There has been a
large absorption of new issues
over the past three years, and,
though in the last 18 months
these have caused no share-
market indigestion—the large
wool cheques and other buoyant
receipts provided a big volume
of investment funds—there is a
reluctance to swallow more and
a tendency, in fact, to take a
profit on what was previously
acquired. There is probably a
good deal of delayed “stagging”
now in progress.
The denationalisation of steel
in Britain is reputed to have
caused the repatriation of a
good deal of British capital
which previously came to Aus-
tralia. It is quite likely also that
the drop in wool and the
budgetary and inflationary prob-
lems which Australia is now
facing have caused the liquida-
tion of overseas holdings of
Australian stocks and the trans-
fer of the money back to the
country of its origin. The
recent heavy fall in Australia’s
overseas funds may not be
entirely the result of adverse
trading experience.
Credit policy is still the chief
worry among Australian inves-
tors —that and the amount of
taxation that will have to be paid
in the first half of 1952. The
effect on pastoralists of the new
taxation method, which involves
a pay-as-you-go principle, has
probably been exaggerated, but
until most assessments for
1950-51 incomes have been met
there is bound to be uncertainty
about the amount of investible
funds remaining in the hands of
those who have previously been
strong supporters of the share-
market.
There is no question but that
at the moment the sharemarkets
of Australia are at sixes and
sevens, and that there is con-
siderable confusion about the
newer stocks.
Speaking of the recent change
in economic trends generally,
the National Bank of Australasia
has commented:
So pronounced was the contrast
between these new conditions and
those of the past five years, and so
suddenly did they come upon the
scene, that the inroads which they
made into optimism were severe—
perhaps too severe.
Many people who had for so long
travelled happily along the high roads
of buoyancy were all too ready to
assume that business, industry and
full employment were at last flounder-
ing in the ditch.
In truth, of course, there is no
room for such extreme assumptions.
Commerce has its problems, but
remains generally active, the indus-
trial achievement of the year is better
than before, and, while some transfer
of employees has been necessary, rela-
tively few hands are disengaged.
There has been an excess of
speculation on the Stock Ex-
change and away from it. Many
small businesses which sprang
up since the war have been
essentially speculative, especially
those which had overseas
agencies for goods in short
supply but very little capital of
their own. When the 90-day-
draft system was abolished by
order of the central bank many
of these enterprises found that
they couldn’t carry on on their
own funds, and the 60 days
allowed to them was inadequate.
Many folded up quietly. Other
larger concerns found them-
selves embarrassed by stocks
which arrived in larger quanti-
ties —and earlier —than usual.
Financial restriction affected
them all.
B.H.P. shares have shown
considerable recovery from the
“low” of 465. 9d. touched a
fortnight ago. The scrip reached
51s. 6d. again last Friday. But
many second-line stocks of
special merit have not shown
corresponding recovery.

and other industrial centres, was

Experience of other people in
the paper-importing trade sug-
gests that this company’s profits
have been estimated on an ultra-
conservative basis for many
years past. Bradford Cotton
ords. may still be bought fto
yield over 5 p.c. This concern
should soon begin to benefit
from its plant-expansion pro-
gramme. It showed 20.4 p.c. on
ord. capital last term, and is the
leader in its particular industry.
Masonite ords. at 61s. 6d. are

of this year (835.), and the co.

power, though recently inhibited
by severe price-control.
How to Increase Production
“Petro”; At Glen Davis
(N.S.W.) long-service leave bene-
fits were forfeited as the result
of two stoppages. The first
occurred on July 5 as a protest
against the Government’s deci-
sion to close down the mine and
refinery, and the second, on
October 15, was staged as a
demonstration against the
Federal Budget. In both in-
stances the stoppages were
endorsed and encouraged by the
Western District of the Miners’
Federation.
But shale-production at Glen
Davis is now stated to be 3.6
tons per man-shift, which is the
highest in the mine’s history.
Crude-oil recovery is claimed to
amount to 70 gallons per ton.
Still, the figures are far too
low to justify the continuance of
operations. During 1950, 98,487
tons of shale was mined, and
from that 5,058,395 gallons of
crude-oil was recovered at a
very considerable financial loss.
These figures show a recovery
rate of 51.3 gallons per ton ; how
recovery has been raised to an
alleged 70 gallons a ton is not
revealed, but it may be due to
more care in throwing back dirt
or to working richer sections of
the deposit, or to both causes.
Assay values of the bottom
48in. of the seam have varied
between 100 and 140 gallons per
ton —say, an average of 120 gal-
lons—and, for the poorer upper
seam, 25 gallons over 16in., thus
giving an overall value of 96
gallons, so that a commercial
yield of 70 gallons is still capable
of considerable improvement.
The depressing fact about
these data is that they could
easily have been attained, and
even surpassed, years ago. Had
this been the case the history of
Glen Davis might have been
very different. There is now,
however, little hope that the
Government, even on the insist-
ence of “Fixer” Ashley, will
reverse its decision to close
down the mine.
Confirming this, the Minister
for National Development (Sena-
tor Spooner) stated in Canberra
on December 10 that tenders
for the purchase of the equip-
ment at Glen Davis will be
called probably within a month.
On the same day Minister
for Supply Beale said that the
Premier of Tasmania’s statement
that the Government was recon-
sidering the transfer of units of
the Glen Davis plant to Bell
Bay and that an international
cartel would take over the plant
was sheer nonsense. “Whatever
arrangements are made,” added
Mr. Beale, “they will be such as
to secure the production of
petroleum coke for the Bell Bay
aluminium works,”
As the method of incentive-
penalty has resulted in an in-
crease in the production of shale
and shale-oil, the application of
a similar technique to coal might
be considered. The underground
production of this fuel —which
in any farsighted policy is of
paramount importance has
remained static. In claiming a
“record” output, as is so often
done just before Christmas, it
should be remembered that any
substantial increase in the coal
figures has been due not to
miners but to quarrymen work-
ing the opencuts which produce,
by and large, a much inferior
fuel to that won at depth.
Up to the end of August em-
ployment in Australia was still
climbing, especially in factories
and the building trades. All-
over unemployment was becom-
ing more microscopic than ever.
National credit policy has since
brought an alteration, but the
number of people who have lost
their jobs is still very small, and
there is ample room for their
re-employment.
* * * *
In spite of all our building
activity (now slackening slightly
because of credit problems) the
Australian output of bricks is
still below pre-war level. Sub-
stitute materials have had a
much wider vogue for the ex-
ternal walls of cottages, mostly
erected in outer suburbs.
* * ♦ *
One reason for the shortage
of food in Australia and the
lack of incentive to produce is
the comparatively high wages
that are now being paid by
dairymen and pastoralists to
farm-workers. The rise in rural
wage-rates (on an hourly basis)
since 1939 has been higher than
in any other class of industry.
Though rural wages may still be
lower than many other industrial
awards, the comparative growth
has been 222 per cent, since
1939, whereas the average in-
crease in wage-rates, covering
all industry, has been 165 per
cent (up to September). There
has been an all-round increase
since.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Investment in Maoriland
New Zealand held to a 3 p.c.
gilt-edged rate a couple of years
longer than Australia, but in the
past half-year it has turned its
back on cheap money, which
ended with the mid-1951 3 p.c.
national development loan that
netted £l3 million. The big
change would have come earlier
but for the wool boom and the
three-month waterfront strike,
which extended the inflationary
cycle by at least six months.
Bank credit today is more
than 50 p.c. above the level
when the Socialists were voted
out, but this rise has come
mainly from external, not in-
ternal, pressure ; it is a product
of higher export values and
soaring prices for imports rather
than of money-spinning and
printing-press methods. On the
home front Maoriland has been
applying the brake against the
pressure by tighter bank credit-
control, but hasn’t been able yet
to halt the rising trend. At the
moment it’s in the middle of an
import boom, brought about by
the rush to stock-up with goods
from abroad since the Board of
Trade decontrolled most im-
ports from soft-currency sup-
pliers, and credit is heavily
strained. A good deal of
liquidation will be necessary in
1952 to get rid of the excess.
In the meanwhile, basic
interest levels have been lifted
by, roughly, i p.c,, and today
it’s a toss-up whether the
Dominion’s next national de-
velopment loan, in mid-year,
will be floated at 3£ p.c., or will
be on a par with Australia’s
rate (3| p.c.). The bond market
has been losing support as
institutions and trustee investors
have been looking for better
yields and other rewards, and
have reduced the proportion of
their funds placed in gilts. As
this won’t help Government and
other public authorities to float
loans from now on, they’ll have
to enlist the services of under-
writers to finance a costly pro-
gramme that includes the Auck-
land harbor bridge, municipal,
harbor, drainage, highway, rail-
way, electric-power and airport
schemes, all more or less in the
blueprint stage. New Zealand
will have to recruit an army of
small investors to broaden the
base of capitalism in its Wel-
fare State, where wealth is now
far more widely spread than in
the old days of freer enterprise,
low taxes and low wages.
Assets are M.L.’s sterling-
value pound and its sound in-
vestment tradition of late years,
since the law was tightened up
and share-pushers, hawkers,
dealers and other questionable
characters fleeced the public a
generation ago during the boom
in forestry bonds, tobacco and
tung-oil shares. Maorilanders
of the older generation haven’t
forgotten that experience.
The young idea will have to
be handled more tactfully.
Genuine investment, which has
been a steadying influence since
the depression, is a good founda-
tion to build on, and if new
recruits in investment ranks can
be trained to keep their eyes on
yields, reserves, turnovers and
managerial skill they should be
on the right lines. Today most
N.Z. cos. show a good margin
of profit over ruling diys. The
main complaint against direc-
tors is that they have been in-
clined to err, if anything, on the
conservative side in waging a so-
far - successful battle against
inflated costs, taxes and wages,
which has developed their mettle
to meet most adversities that are
likely to come their way.
The Economic Scene
Maoriland’s nine - year - old
rigid price-control system has a
lot to answer for in the patch-
work of controlled and uncon-
trolled, distorted prices and easy
profits for exploiters and
profiteers that has grown up dur-
ing the post-war spending spree.
It was never figured out in 1942,
when the Socialists hit on the
bright idea of holding down
prices for necessaries of life by
percentages and fixed ceiling
mark-ups, based on cost, that
the inflation they were beginning
to pour in would one day bring
trouble; but Maoriland traders
have been on the point of revolt
for some time past as price-
fixing on the Socialist pattern
has been allowed to run on.
Manufacturers, wholesalers
and retailers have all been kick-
ing, but haven’t been able to
make much impression on the
Socialist-trained Price Tribunal,
which, to them, is the villain of
the piece. P.T. price-margins,
computed years ago, when over-*
heads were a long way below
present levels, have been slowly
getting a stranglehold on profits,
and have left no room for enter-
prise in genuine trade. Profits
for cos. under the yoke began to
level off from 1948 onwards, and
in the past year or so showed
a downtrend for the first time
since 1939. They’ve been slid-
ing further lately, under the
squeeze of last summer’s record
general wage-rise and soaring
costs in every direction, whilst
turnovers have recently con-
tracted as a result of credit-
tightening.
N.Z. chairmen want to know
whether price-fixing that fleeces
trade and industry to shelter
consumers will help anyone in
the long run —and not so long
either.
What happens to
pressure that is dammed back in
N.Z. to keep bread-and-butter
lines, footwear, clothing, gas and
other needs within reach of the
average purse? It isn’t siphoned
off, and doesn’t lie harmlessly
around, but boosts prices for
everything outside controlled
boundaries. Motor-cars and
houses have been hot favorites.
Car-salesmen are M.L.’s new
rich, and until recently dealing
in cars was the biggest racket.
While Maorilanders waited for
new cars, brand-new models
were spirited away to used-car
salesrooms almost before their
speedometers started to tick, and
their price jumped a few hun-
dred as M.L. buyers, who
queued up eagerly to pay almost
any figure asked, stepped in to
pick their fancies. The credit-
restriction policy has damped
down the racket for the moment,
but it’s likely to flare up again.
Profiteers in cars, and in homes,
too, have had a wonderful
picnic, partly at the expense of
legitimate, honest, hard-working
traders, like grocers, footwear
firms and drapers, who have had
to tighten their belts, foot heavy
tax bills and scratch to make
ends meet. No fat profits for
them, as for the easy-money
gentry who are also champion
tax-dodgers. In N.Z., as in Aus-
tralia, far too much money has
been going into cars.
N.Z. has a big account to
settle with price-control over the
way it’s been sapping the life-
blood of genuine trade, and con-
verting Maorilanders into spend-
thrifts in directions where they’re
ready dupes for sharp dealers.
It’s “God’s own country” for all
who know enough about busi-
ness and robbery to sidestep
controls and gather in the wind-
falls of super-prosperity; for
these there’s no happier hunting-
ground anywhere.
M.L., however, will have to
mind its step in relaxing
controls, because inflation sealed
off from controlled areas could
surge in before contraction in
bank credit eased the pressure
in the rear. Balance can’t be
restored overnight. Meanwhile,
life will have to be made as
comfortable as possible for those
who are having a lean time.

“Brick E.”: A Sydney daily acclaimed
Churchill in an editorial that ran:
‘‘.Whether building a brick wall in his
garden or leading an Empire to
victory,” etc. Mueh as I admire the old
bulldog I can’t accept his bricklaying as
an accomplishment even remotely worthy
of praise. The photographs of his handi-
work reveal a job no better or worse
than that of any other enthusiastic but
unskilled amateur. Nor could it be
expected to be otherwise—the mortar y
art consists of about 25 per cent, know-
how and 75 per cent, of hand skill.
Winnie’s busy life has hardly left him
time to acquire either. But what is it
about bricklaying that attracts the big
men in politics? Billy Hughes, accord-
ing to a Press report, delights in doing a
spot of bricklaying about the place. A
photo I saw of his job, alas, put him on
a lower plane than Winston. Churchill
is a member of the British Bricklayers'
Union, and although the honor was con-
ferred as an appreciation of his states-
manship rather than in recognition of his
ability as a brickie, it speaks highly for
the liberal outlook of the union con-
cerned. When I see a similar honor
bestowed on Billy I’ll begin to believe
that Commos and party-politics have
been bunged out of the Aussie branches
of the fraternity.

“Phil Anthus”; Sydney columnists
have broken out in a rash of “charac-
teritis.” Almost every citizen who swims
into their ken is a “character.” A lucky
entrant may become a “feller,” but in no
circumstances is he allowed to be a mere
man, or even a bloke. He has to be a
“character.” In one column the other
day “characters” bobbed up in pretty
well every paragraph; they ranged from
Bank of New South Wales characters”
to “an anonymous character.” Years ago
a “character” was an odd fellow, an
eccentric. For example, The Bulletin
remarked in January, 1881, when writing
of a former explorer, that he had become
“what people term a ‘character,’ living
alone and maintaining himself by hunt-
ing and shooting.” Later, the term
became the equivalent of “a.hard case,”
a quaint and amusing person. But now,
alas, through the machinations of the
columnist brigade a character is merely
a person, presumably malearfd without
any real character at all.

“Teeperce”: During a G.O.C.’s inspec-
tion at Gaza our C. 0., who had
strategically detached himself from the
staff entourage, stood aghast when the
general paused during the examination
of the guard to exchange some earnest
conversation with Rusty. Being out of
earshot he did not know that the dialogue
consisted of a question, an admission of
failure to shave and a firm injunction to
attend to this detail immediately after the
guard was dismounted. Hardly had the
G.O.C. departed when the Old Man was
demanding of Rusty the subject of the
remarks. With the steady gaze of the
born prevaricator Rusty looked the Old
Man in the eyes and told him. “He said
I had to get a new hat, sir.” This explains
why Rusty, at a time when even field-
officers were wearing hats better suited
for back-o’-Bourke scarecrows, sported a
new fur-felt. In his anxiety to meet the
G.O.C.’s wishes on the spot, the Old
Man failed to note Rusty’s stubbly chin
El Verdugo”; Persia is looked on as

lor instance, the one in Tehran where
last week a fight developed out of a
strike organised when several maidens
were expelled for chalking the name of
Uncle Joe Stalin on the walls. The fight
was a good one—it soon outgrew the
arena of the school grounds and poured
into the street. A shout for reinforce-
ments brought up a boys’ scho'ol—not
unanimous, fortunately- —en masse. Five
fire-engines poured water on the conflict
without effect except to wash out the
battered remains of* some interfering
coppers. The Persian Army was then
called out with fixed bayonets and tear-
gas, but stood baffled until exhaustion
overcame the gazelle-like creatures, and
thtfse of them who were not carried off
by the ambulances strolled off to the

“Sack”: What psychologists window-
dressers are! One of Sydney’s biggest
stores has devoted an enormous expanse
of window to the display of ultra-super
dolls. Nobody would pay £22-odd to
buy a doll for a girl, even though .the
glamorous effigy stood about as as a
table, wore clothes like a film-star’s, and
had waved human hair in blonde,
brunette or auburn. And as for giving a
kid a doll that cost 34 fiddlies! Never-
theless, if I know the sex, all those dolls
will be sold. A few unfortunate kids
will be formally presented with the sacred
things and allowed to touch them with
reverent hands before they are carefully
placed out of harm’s way on the top
shelf of the wardrobe —to be taken down
and gloated over by mumma whenever she
thinks back on how she would have loved
a doll like that. How different is the
set-up where we men are concerned. In
that window is a donkey-engine. Gosh,
what a beauty! Pistons, governors, fly-
wheels —the whole works; and only
about 17 quid. When I was a kid I’d
have given both my ears and half my
nose for one like that. And now—but,
darn it, you can’t give a nephew a
donkey-engine when he’s still in nappies!

“Rooster”; .Most Tobruk Rats will
remember the outbreak of barcoo-rot
during the siege. Jo city men this evil-
looking type of sore was something new ;
those from the dry outback knew it well.
The most important predisposing factor
to the disease is aridity and the un-
balanced diet which often accompanies
arid conditions. Sweating, often
unnoticed because of rapid evaporation,
causes marked dehydration, and the
resultant thirst encourages copious intake
of beer, and, when this runs out, water.
In this way precious minerals in the
bloodstream are lost. In Tobruk the
ascorbic-acid tablets took the place of
fresh greens and fruit, but many still
became victims of barcoo-rot or desert-
sore.

“Zake”; The changing values of pinch-
able goods have noy been recognised by
the burglar. One of them did a daylight
job on my neighbor—his wife is in
hospital and his children temporarily dis-
persed among relations. With no response
to his knocking, this brainy strategist put
a brick through the front window, which,
of course, attracted the attention of the
woman opposite. The cops caught up
with him after he had gathered the swag
together, and while he was under the bed,
presumably making a detailed study of
the carpet-pattern. The traditionally-
yaluable items like silverware and
jewellery he completely ignored, though
he paid tribute to the enduring value of
gold by grabbing a wrist-watch. But the
most prominent among the pile of stuff
he had collected for transport—the
majority of it was clothing—were a few
tins of preserved fruit, a pound of butter
and four eggs !

“Ceg”: Christmas raffles (B.
28/11/’51)? One Christmas Eve we*were
all packed up ready to depart for the
seaside. Everything had been locked up
and the cat and canary boarded out, and
we were waiting with the luggage at
the front-door when a van drew up and
the driver barged across the footpath
with a large crate containing one very
much alive and hissing goose, which he
dumped on the steps. Out to the van
again and back with a case of beer. For
the first time in my fife I had won a
raffle. The beer presented no difficulty,
but the bird was another matter. In
reply to my inquiry it said it did not
fancy accompanying us to the seaside,
so, somewhat relieved, I gave it to the
carrier. I have often stayed home for
Christmas since then, but I’ve never won
another goose.

“8.A.K.”: In defending the übiquitous
little adverb “up” (B. 31/10/’5l)
“W.M.H.” proves himself to be con-
versant with Greek and English, but his
example shows a lamentable ignorance
of “English as she is spoke”—per medium
of that universal educator, Hollywood.
The American housewife, it becomes very
obvious, does not “wash up,” she “washes
dishes.” And I’ve yet to read a “success-
through - sheer - courage - and - acting-
ability” blurb that doesn’t trot out the
old stand-by: “I was
flat broke ; I washed
dishes.” Personally,
I’d have a lot more
respect, for a strug-
gling actor who
would swing a mad
mick for an honest
crust, but a man
who would wash
dishes is plainly
Hollywood’s concep-
tion of a hero who
will descend to the
depths of humiliation and heartbreaking
toil in pursuit of his goal. For
“W.M.H.’s” information, however, I
must point out that they never “wash
up.” The “wash-up” comes later —when
box-office receipts have proved yet again
that ballyhoo and publicity can merely
fool some of the people some of the
time.

“L.A.P.”: On a memorial by the
roadside on the Western Highway at
Deep Lead (Vic.) a man and a goat in
bronze relief face each other across an
eloquent tribute to both. The now-tiny
village was once the scene of extensive
and prosperous diggings. Like many
alluvial fields it is a barren, dry spot,
where, before the introduction of
improved pastures and the sinking of
dams, a cow could barely exist. The
native herbage, however, was just to the
taste of the goats which flourished there
in large numbers. Many a sick miner
and young child had cause to bless goat’s
milk, and now that the pioneers of the
district have been honored nanny has
not been forgotten.

Cigars some females don’t. I’m told—

And we shall drive on day by day
Over the hills and far away
And build a little humpy, and
Grow vegetables in the sand,
And so defeat the fearful drought
That city people talk about;
And one day, in the sunset glow,
My tender thoughts will homeward go:
Poor Mrs. Swillie, Moke and John—
J wonder how they’re getting on! ”
And as reflection wanders far
At last I’ll light my small cigar.

“Jasby”: The treasure-hunting season
seems to be with us again. Captain
Kidd’s hoard is, of course, always on the
verge of being uncovered, but the Queen
of Sheba’s treasure, though very ancient
in itself, is something new in the way
of news. Two expeditions are after it.
One, so a Newcastle man told Melbourne
reporters, is to be led by Adrian Conan
Doyle, son of Sir Arthur, and will con-
centrate on “the well-preserved ruins of
a palace of more than 400 rooms” on an
uncharted island 100 miles south of
Zanzibar. Mr. Simmonds, the Newcastle
man, helped Doyle discover the ruins, in
which they found “coins dating back to
the Queen of Sheba.” He doesn’t say
how the coins were identified. Sheba,
according to Biblical story, visited
Solomon in the tenth century b.c., and
the oldest coins known to collectors
weren’t struck till about 500 years after
that. What puzzles me is why the lady
needed 400 rooms in her palace. Now, if
it had been Solomon! . . . The second
expedition, sponsored by the American
Foundation for the Study of Man, will
seek Sheba’s tomb, which it believes to
be buried with the ruins of her city,
Mareb, beneath the sands of the Arabian
desert, about 200 miles from the Red Sea.
Climbing, not digging, is the job of French
explorer Jean de Riquer, leader of the
third treasure hunt. Locality?—Mount
Ararat. Treasure? —Noah’s Ark.

“Bo”: I have always regarded the
neighbor’s small, elderly tyke as of bene-
volent intent, one whose happy, whiskery
dial reflected his philosophic outlook on
life. Of late, however, he* has begun to
wear an expression of bitter frustration,
and this I took to be indicative of his
realisation that the burden of increasing
years had put a brake on his gay galli-
vantings. It was not until I captured a
totally different expression on his mug-
black hatred, as he gazed at the big
shining new sedan his boss had lately
bought—that I realised my error, and
remembered the look of almost holy joy
he used to wear as he. emerged from
under the old, low-slung model they
owned before, and along the sump and
diff, of which he used to rub his spine.
The same parts of the new car are 3in.
above his back. Well, wouldn’t it get
any hound’s back up?

“Ceg”: Friends who recently moved
from the city to the bush were holding
forth on the wonderful saving in living-
expenses. They were enthusiastic over
the fact that handfuls of kindling-wood
could be picked up on their bush-walks,
free. And the lovely mushrooms, which
are so expensive in the city! I know the
answer to that one. A trudge of five
miles or so through damp paddocks and,
if the season is favorable, half a billy of
black, sodden, worm-punctured mushies.
In half a mile’s walk in the hated city
here’s a list of what I could have
collected: Two nice red tomatoes and
a few spuds on the road outside a green-
grocer’s shop; a hundredweight of coal
briquettes, scattered from a motor-truck
as it raced along at 40 m.p.h,; a dozen
or so bread-rolls and a few loaves, from
an overturned baker’s-cart; some roses
rioting over a garden fence, and dozens of
bottles of milk from different doorsteps ;
“Stand back , Mum —I'm going to paint this room all the one color."
one horseshoe, three hub-caps, a dozen
assorted bolts and nut? and enough
bumpers to keep me in smokes for a
week. Don’t talk to me about cheap
living in the country.

“Phyl”: Years in the Queensland bush
must have coarsened Rachel Henning.
How else can we account for that refined
and gently nurtured English gentlewoman
allowing Mr. Somerville to crack peach-
stones with a hammer on her kitchen-
table? Or perhaps it is the artist who is
permitting the table-surface to be mal-
treated (B. 5/12/’5l). Rachel merely
wrote “Mr. Somerville cracked the
stones.” My guess is that she chased
him outside to do it.
“M’Low”: Rachel Henning’s arithmetic
is femininely weak since she, born in
1826, speaks of herself in 1865 as being
37. But, since she was then telling a
sister of her engagement to Deighton
Taylor, “a boy of little over thirty,” and
had commonsense enough to realise how
her family would disapprove on that very
ground, she would naturally minimise the
age-disparity.

“G.1.L.”: In a magazine published in
1849 I found an article on juvenile
delinquency; among other reasons, the
writer condemned the long hours worked
by children in factories, arguing that the
hard work and long confinement must
be bad for body and mind alike. Besides,
he argued, how could the parents find
time to train their children if the
children were never at home except to
sleep the sleep of exhaustion? Nowa-
days we hear of children becoming
delinquent because the parents are’too
much occupied with earning a living.
There was, however, a familiar ring
about another of the writer’s findings.
Young people working these long hours,
he claimed, earned too much money and
squandered it because they did not
appreciate its value. I seem to have heard
something very much like that about the
present-day youngsters.

“C.A.L.”: Paddy and Scotty were talk-
ing fight, and their cobbers joining in
the argument were ready to take sides
when the first blow fell. At last words
were exhausted and honors had to be
vindicated, so Paddy let go with his right,
though Scotty was not on the receiving
end. Instead, a quiet inoffensive man
standing near by, silently drinking his
beer and taking no part in the argument,
collected the bunch of fives at the point
of the jaw. “What did you hit me for?”
he .demanded on regaining his feet. “I
didn’t say a word.” “That’s just the
trouble,” Paddy retorted. “You’re one of
them thinking blokes that’s worse than
the cows with all the gab.”

“H.G.8.”: I can’t disguise my contempt
for people who whitewash or chalk
propaganda catchcries on walls. If their
efforts showed the finesse of the true
artist or the ingenuity of the polished
turner-of-phrases my aesthetic side could,
perhaps, find some balm therein, even
though my commonsense rebelled at the
statements flaunted. But no ; the white-
washed legends are always so runny and
watery they appear to be shivering with
cold, while the chalked ones suggest a
class of potential chalkers receiving their
final instructions: “Now, that is what
you must write. Note it carefully. Don t
forget to make the ‘z’ in Menzies the
way*! showed you, and don’t attempt to
alter or add to the message—you couldn t
spell it right.” But today I saw a chalked
message that thrilled my cynical heart.
Here, scrawled on the side of a railway
carriage, was a cry from the heart of an
individualist, a protagonist who obeyed
no instructions from rabid opportunists.
He was fighting a vain battle, if ever
there was one, but thousands would, in
their innermost hearts, endorse his senti-
ments. In schoolboy lettering the radical
statement ran: “LATIN STINKS.”

“Student”: A bent 2in. nail gave me
a lesson in human nature the other day.
It lay on the road, and a grey-suited, cigar-
smoking citizen kicked it into the gutter
before getting into his car and driving
off. No doubt he was thinking of the
other bloke’s tyres besides his own, but
what made the old gent, who came along
shortly afterwards prod it on to the road
again with his umbrella? The next to
sight the nail was a young bloke who put
it into his pocket, muttered “She’ll
straighten,” and hurried on.

“Hamer”: “Blind Freddy could see
that!” thrown into a political argument
recently showed that the memory of
Fred Solomon has not altogether faded,
although nearly two decades ago The
Bulletin allowed me
to give him his
obit. “Blind Freddy”
was in the “house-
hold-words” group
during his life; he
made his way about
and rode the trams
with a marvellous
ease and resented
rather than, appreci-
ated offers of assist-
ance; a highly-
cultivated extra-sense
may have helped, for
he told me once
that he could feel
the buildings near
him and knew where
he was from that.
Once, in King-street
(Sydney), some
people asked him
the way to Cathcart
House; they started
to apologise when
they saw that he was
blind, but he cut
that short with direc-
tions which included
the crossings they
would have to pass in
Castlereagh - street,
and the exact posi-
tion of the building
sought. Shortly
after the First
World War an old-time Bohemian,
just back from Europe, hailed him in a
pub with a “Hullo, Freddy; I bet you
don’t know who I am?” To which
Freddy replied promptly: “Of course
I do; you’re Hughie Maclean! When
did you get back?” Freddy scorned a
pension ', he made quite a good living as
a hawker —enough to enable him to leave
a tidy estate when he died. There have
been many very capable blind men in
Australia, including several mejnbers of
Parliament; but Blind Freddy was in a
class of his own, and his name looks like
passing into the language.

“Eve”; Ways of gauging your popu-
larity with the restaurant-owner vary
according to the times. In spud-shortages,
you know you’re on the inside if you
get three instead of one strip of potato
snuggling up to your grilled steak. In
meat-shortages you know you’re a pet
of the management if you get 2in. instead
of one fibre of meat snuggling under the
salad. So I quite understood when Bill
beamed to me, “See that place? I’m so
good with the proprietor that when I had
breakfast there yesterday he sneaked out
to me with the pepper-pot! Gosh! You
should’ve seen the other customers go
green with envy.”

“Gumsucker”: Early X-rays (B.
28/11 /’51)? Sixty years ago I bought
for sixpence a magic “X-ray tube,”
through which one could see the bones
of the hand. And certainly it did show a
curious shadowed outline of the fingers
that might have passed for the bones.
After amusing and astonishing my pals
for a day I broke the tube open to
investigate the works —and found only
the portion of a goose feather. I’ve often
wondered who thought that one out —
that light refracted through the lamina;
of a feather would produce the illusion
of X-ray.

“Mens”: “Cauboy” (B. 28/11/’SI)
seems to have got his dates mixed. The
opera “Madame Butterfly” was not
produced until 1904 at La Scala, Milan.
In 1900 Williamson’s Italian Opera Co.,
under the conductorship of Roberto
Hazon, produced “La Boherae,” with a
fine cast of artists, including Bassich,
Dani and others; other new works that
season were Verdi’s “Otello” and
Giordano’s “Fedora.” De Vere Sapio
was Desdemona and Larrizza Otello.
“Madame Butterfly” was produced many
years later by Hazon. Two sopranos sang
the role of Cho-Cho-San, taken on
alternate nights by Bel Sorell and Amy
Castles, and the opera ran for several
weeks; the opening-date was March 29,
1910. Other artists in that company
included Rosina Buckman, Frank
Blarney, Arthur Crane and many other
well-known people; incidentally I think
the opera was sung in English.

“Fimiston”: The earth in its depths
holds many mysteries, from which death
in unexpected forms may leap at men.
Operating a diamond-drill on the 2650 ft.
level of the Great Boulder mine (W.A.)
two drillers were struck by a violent
explosion that leaped into their faces from
the narrow drill-hole. 1 The drill-head, it
is surmised, had broken into a pocket of
explosive gas under such pressure that
it had rushed back along the 1600 ft, of
"No! You CANNOT be an A.W.A.S’. batman!”
drill-hole to explode on contact with the
air. Earlier in the drilling a pocket of
foul-smelling, though not explosive, gas
had been encountered, but no expectation
of meeting inflammable gas had been
entertained. Both men were fatally
injured. How such a pocket of gas came
to be entombed in the solid rock nearly
3000 ft. down is a puzzle, for the “country
rock” of the Golden Mile is diorite, an
igneous rock reckoned to be one of the
earliest formations that make up the crust
of the globe.

The Letters of Rachel Henning
“The Peach Trees/’
November 23, 1871.
My Dearest Etta,
I was amused at your account
of Miss West. Fancy an old
lady of sixty going in for
costumes and short dresses!
The latter have never “taken” in
Australia except for quite young
girls. You seldom see married
or middle-aged ladies in them.
Neither Annie nor I have ever
worn them shorter than touch-
ing the ground, and the same
with most of our contemporaries.
Emily Tucker, Biddulph’s
intended, who is one of the best-
dressed girls in Sydney, never
wears them.
I told you in my last letter
about my visit to Sydney (for
Mr. Taylor did not go) and
Biddulph’s engagement. I do
not know yet when the wedding
is to be. We are expecting Bid-
dulph up here for a few days
before Christmas. It will be such
a pleasure to see him ; he has
only been here once before.
Annie says that he and Emily
are very much in love with one
another, and never happy when
apart, which is all as it should
be, I believe in “love matches,”
as they are called, as much as
any young girl of eighteen!
I hope by this time they have
sent you a photograph of Emily.
She is a very fine-looking girl
and has a magnificent figure.
We all like her, and think Bid-
dulph very fortunate, and I am
sure she is fortunate also.
I wish you could see the
Peach Trees now. The garden
is lovely, such a glow of flowers
of all kinds and colors, to say
nothing of the stands of pela-
goniums in the veranda, which
are my especial pride. We have
had a beautiful summer hitherto
after all the prophecies of a
drought. There has been rain
once a fortnight at least, and
everything is green and luxuriant.
I am busy rearing poultry
now, and have two families of
chickens to attend to. I have
also just cut out and begun
another pair of trousers for Mr.
Taylor, and have completed a
bolster for the spare bed, while
Charlotte is taking feathers off
our own defunct fowls for a
pillow. A good deal of home
manufacture goes on in the
bush, and it saves a great deal
of money.
Our piano wears very well,
and I must again thank you for
sending me the “Kelpie’s Bride.”
It is a charming song, and Mr.
Taylor is never tired of hearing
it. I cannot think how you
know so well what suits me.
When it is so many years since
you have heard me sing.
A piece of Stroud news is that
one of our neighbors (who lives
by the bay in one of the best
houses in the district), having
been put in the lock-up by the
constable for drunkenness, took
to parading Stroud on horseback ,
with a loaded revolver in his
hand, threatening to shoot the
said constable if he again inter-
fered with him. Said constable,
not liking the revolver, sat
quietly on the veranda of his
friends to come out and spend a
week with us who are so very
kind in accommodating us at all
times that one cannot but be
glad to see them. Otherwise I
do not cotton very much to
visitors beyond our own family.
When you have only one servant
who is an indifferent cook it is
rather a trouble to entertain
people.
Ever your affectionate sister.
Rachel Taylor.
‘The Pea ch Trees/'
February 1, 1872.
My Dearest Etta,
I am sorry to say that I missed
writing to you by the January
mail, partly through not know-
ing when it left Sydney, and
partly through having had my
thoughts very full of our own
concerns just then, for we are
contemplating a remove from
the Peach Trees, a great event
in our quiet lives.
I wish I could send you a
sketch of our house, but I am
afraid now it will have to be a
view of the next house we live
in, for we have made up our
minds to leave this as soon as
we can sell it. It is not that we
are tired of the place, for it
grows prettier every year and
we shall both be very sorry to
give it up; but we have both
come to the conclusion that it
is too lonely a place to grow
old in!
We are nearly three miles
from the nearest farm or from
Stroud and almost three days’
journey from Sydney. The ride
to Stroud and the journey to
Sydney we think little of now,
but some years hence it may be
different, and in case of illness
(and we cannot reckon on hav-
ing always our present good
health) we are far from help
of any kind, medical or other-
wise. Besides these reasons, Mr.
Taylor would like a place where
he is near a market and can get
better sale for his pigs and cattle,
so we are only waiting to sell
this farm to move. We can let
it easily, but we want to sell it
and have no more trouble about
it.
We have advertised for a farm
“within thirty miles of Sydney
and five of a railway-station,”
and have had • numbers of
answers. Some of them seem
eligible, but one cannot decide
on anything till we can sell this
and go down and look at some
places. Biddulph is very kind in
making inquiries for us also;
he was up here for a flying visit

shortly before Christmas, and
he strongly advised our moving.
Next time I write I hope to be
able to tdl you something
definite, and in the meantime
do not direct here any more but
to the care of Messrs. Tucker
and Co.
Deighton has just called me
out to look at a “death-adder”
which he killed among the
cucumber-vines. Some of the
snakes are very pretty, but this
is a horrid-looking thing about
two feet long and as thick as
your wrist, with a flat, wicked-
looking head and the tail taper-
ing suddenly, not gradually, like
most snakes; a dirty brown
color. It is one of the most
poisonous of all, and there is no
antidote known for its bite. I
have been remonstrating with
the “old man” about meddling
with the cucumbers any more,
for fear there should be another
adder there; it is not often you
hear of accidents, but such possi-
bilities make one uneasy.
You must excuse me if my
letter is a little unconnected, as
the Irishman said of Johnson’s
dictionary, as I have a new
servant just caught from the
bush, and have to make sallies
into the kitchen to tell her into
what saucepan to put the
potatoes, etc., as otherwise I
might possibly find them in the
tea-kettle. She had never seen
a pair of bellows when she came,
and asked me why we kept a
bottle of water on the wash-
stand. She is exceedingly willing
and industrious, however; we
give her Bs. a week.
Although you would not think
there was much to do in the
bush, it is astonishing how busy
I am all day, and how many
things there are to see after. We
generally get up about six, and
yet the day is always gone too
soon. We are having a very hot
summer, though not a dry one.
We have had a great deal of
rain, and that and the hot sun
has, made everything grow quite
wild ; the garden, though it is
full of flowers, looks like a
wilderness, and now that we are
going away I do not care to take
much trouble about it. I shall
be very sorry to leave the
garden ; both that and the house
are so pretty, but wherever we
are we shall soon make a garden.
It will be very pleasant to be
within easy reach of Sydney
now that Annie and Biddulph
are both settled there; a thirty-
mile journey by railway is
nothing, and we could often run
up and see them and they could

come and see us as well as other
of our friends.
Biddulph’s house on the North
Shore is in progress. I know the
situation, and it will have a most
lovely view. Old Mr. Tucker
declines to give his daughters
any money during his life, but
he builds them a good house
when they marry, and as those
North Shore houses let for £l5O
a year it is not to be despised.
But I suppose Annie keeps
you informed of all Sydney
news. Do you remember Mr,
Aylward, Biddulph’s tutor at
Exmouth? I saw his death in
the “Home News” this month.
He was vicar of Chesharn in
Buckinghamshire. How many
of that Exmouth party are gone
now, and how old the rest are
getting!
And yet I don’t think one
feels much older. Life seems just
as pleasant, perhaps pleasanter.
It is time to conclude when
one begins to cut shorter the
way with moral reflections. I
must go and make some melted
butter for the vegetable-marrow
and cut up a cucumber.
Deighton brought down a
bucketful this morning.
With very much love, believe
me, my dearest Etta,
Your affectionate sister.
Rachel Taylor.
Mount Vernon,*
August 9, 1872.
My Uearest Etta,
Annie and Mr. Hedgeland are
both gone to bed very tired, and
my husband has taken the
carriage to fetch Biddulph back
from a friend’s where he has
been spending the evening.
We have, I think, at last found
an abode that will suit us.
About a fortnight ago Mr.
Taylor and I made an excursion
to Wollongong to look at some
farms that we had heard of
there. We went down by the
steamer, which only takes about
five hours going from Sydney,
took up our residence at the
Queen’s Hotel (a very comfort-
able place), and spent the next
day in driving out to see the
farms in question. There were
two by Lake Illawarra that we
did not like, but one on what
they call American Creek we
were delighted with.
The land is very good. There
is a tolerable house which we
can inhabit while we build
another, a creek (as they call a
brook here) running right
through the farm, and a site for
a new house where there is a
most lovely view of the whole
Bulli Range. We heard today
that the owner will accept the
sum we offered for it, so if the
title, etc., prove satisfactory, we
shall probably complete the
purchase.
We shall be very glad to be
settled again, as you may
imagine. If we do go to
Wollongong we shall be within
easy reach of Sydney and all
our friends here, as besides the
steamer there is a coach road
over the mountains. We
returned that way, and a very
good road it is. It was made, I
believe, chiefly in consequence
of Biddulph’s representations
when he lived there.
Of course it is steep in parts,
and passengers with any
humanity in them generally walk
to the top, but you can hardly
imagine anything more beautiful
than the scenery. Sometimes at
a turn of the road you look
down upon green depths of
tropical vegetation, cabbage-
palms and tree-ferns and magni-
ficent trees, etc., all bound
together by festoons of flower-
ing creepers. The whole valley
of Illawarra lying below, and
the sea and the “Five Islands”
beyond all. The beauty ceases
at the top of the mountain, and
a dull road leads to Campbell-
town, where you take train for
Sydney.
Our farm is not near the Bulli
Mountain, but three miles on the
other side of Wollongong,
where, however, the scenery is
also very beautiful. Having
once seen the Illawarra district
quite spoils you for any other
part of Australia. If no un-
expected hitch occurs I hope we
shall soon have a home of our
own there.
They are all prospering here.
Mr. Hedgeland has as much
work surveying as he can get
through, and must be making a
great deal of money. Biddulph
ditto, as well by copper-, gold-
and tinrgines as by his regular
business, f He is looking so v.ell
and full of spirits. This morn-
ing he made me a most welcome
present of a very nice horse
that I have long been in love
with but did not dream of
possessing. Biddulph boug
him for his own riding som
time ago, when, by the way,
was the first lady who venturec
on his back, for he is ve
spirited. Then Biddulph strainer
him in galloping over rocks, anc
he was sent up to the Peac
Trees for rest. He recovered
there, and we brought him dow
with us, and now Biddulph, hav
ing several other horses, ha
given him to me to take down
Wollongong.
He is the kindest of brother
A week or two ago he gav
Annie a set of real sables, magm
ficent to behold. This has bee
a very cold winter, and fur
universally worn.
I suppose your children wer
looking forward to the holiday
when you wrote, and I hope
you had better weather than tha
you describe. The season here
has been exactly the reverse. We
have had a drought for nearly
four months, and although it is
beautiful weather, the matter is
getting serious, as very soon
there will be nothing for the
cattle to eat in districts where
the land is poor.
We have been down here more
than two months now, and I
have never taken out an umbrella
since we came. The dust is as
bad as in the height of summer,
and winter clothes show it so
much that we are always brush-
ing, We have had a great deal
of cold wind. Nevertheless, the
days have been bright and
beautiful, and the flowers are
coming out in the bush. I often
take Teddy X for a walk on the
wild hills that lie between
Randwick and Botany. They are
low hills of white sand, and are
covered with low-growing shrubs
and flowers of all descriptions.
There are also a great many
flowers in the garden—
geraniums and petunias and
hyacinths and jonquils. Annie,
however, does not take any great
interest in the garden, as the
Hedgelands do not mean to con-
tinue in this house after Bid-
dulph is married, which will be
shortly now. They will move to
some place that will be more
convenient to Mr. Hedgeland’s
work than this is.
I sat down intending only to
write a short letter, and it has
lengthened itself out into two
sheets. Annie sends kind love.
Goodnight and goodbye, with
best love to Mr. Boyce and your-
self. Believe me, dearest Etta,
Ever your affectionate sister,
RACHEL TAYLOR.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Sackville”: Darkness had trapped me,
and, having no light on the bike, I was
straining my eyes to see the rural road
ahead. Even so, I nearly barged into the
stationary utility. It showed no lights
at all. As I fell off in my struggles to
get out of the ruts and circle around the
ancient “bomb,” a lanky, spidery figure
appeared out of the bushes by the road-
side. “Got a match?” he asked hope-
fully. I
a p o 1 ogised
abjectly for
being a non-
smoker and
therefore
mate hless.
“Huh, ”
grunted the
human hair-
pi n dis-
gustedly.
“Just my
flamin’ 1 luck.
First I lose me matches; then the bus
breaks down ; then the battery goes flat;
then I can’t find the startin’-handle; and
then —the one bloke that comes along
this Godforsaken road hasn’t got a
match!” I apologised again, but offered
to make amends by helping him find the
handle. “Where is it —in the back of
your bus?” I asked. “No,” came the
embittered reply. “Somewhere in the
bushes over on the right there.” There
are easier things to find than a starting-
handle in thick tea-tree scrub. It was
the greatest of all flukes that, after 15
minutes of searching, I found the thing—
or, rather, it found me, by dropping on
my head as I searched beneath the bush
like a bloodhound. Not until then did I
begin to wonder how it came to be so
far from the vehicle. “How’d it get
there?” breathed the motorist in reply
to my question. “I pelted it there, o’
course, when the blasted bus wouldn’t
start. Wouldn’t you —but, ar, what’s the
use of tryin’ to explain to a half-baked
wowser who don’t know what it feels
like to be dyin’ for a smoke!”
* * * *
“Uncle Si”: They were talkin’ about
flyin’-foxes, and one young bloke said
his brother, who was at the university,
reckoned it was flyin’-foxes that put
them on to radar during the war and so
beat Hitler —did you ever hear such
nonsense? And the rest of ’em had every
patent way of dealing with the pests
except goin’ out to their camp in daytime
with a few dozen guns and blazing into
them while they had ’em cold. They’ll
get round to that in time; but to hear
them fellers talking—why, they were
suckin’ mother’s milk when me and me
mates in the old days were dealing with
these blanky foxes in millions. These
young blokes was talkin’ about how they
tried hanging lighted lanterns in the trees
and sheets of newspaper; and after a
“I’ve heard all about cattle-dogs and sheep-dogs—I suppose you're
a pig-dog."
bit I broke in and sez to them
look, you’re wastin’ your time; you
ought to get to know a bit about them
foxes, I Sez, they can nut out simple
things like that. Why, I sez, if you lay
low and watch ’em you’ll see them
taking up the papers and carryin’
them over to the lanterns to read ’em
while they eats your fruit. Get out to
their camp, I sez, in the daytime and
massacre them, before they really popu-
late up in the district. You ain’t really
seen yet what flyin’-foxes can do if you
let ’em, I sez —and no more they ain’t.
“Pedant”: It is a tribute to scientists
generally that a theory, evolved purely
as a hypothesis to explain something not
capable at the "time of practical demon-
stration, may many years after receive
•ocular demonstration of its having been
correct. To explain the formation of
quartz reefs, distinct as such are from
lode formations obviously of igneous
origin, geologists held that quartz was laid
down originally by water that had at
some time flooded into cracks in the rocks,
there to precipitate the quartz as crystal.
Which also accounts for the beautifully-
clear quartz pebble, so much sought-after
in earlier times for the making of high-
grade spectacles. To account for the
suspension of silica (quartz) in water,
science postulated that plain water under
conditions of intense heat and pressure
became capable of dissolving silica
crystals from other rocks, such as granite.
But it was not until within the last half-
century or so, bringing the construction
of steam-boilers capable of standing a
pressure of 260 pounds to the square
inch, that this solvent property of water
could be demonstrated. Attendants on
such boilers must always be on the guard
against the explosion of gauge-glass tubes.
These, of the finest-quality glass, show
the height of water inside the boiler.
Acted on by high-pre'ssure steam and
water, the inside of such tubes slowly
dissolves. And, of course, silica (quartz)
is one of the chief components of glass.
* * * *
“Ceg”: That bloodwood-tree and the
fencing-line (B. 28/11/’5l) reminded me
of the predicament in which a Gippsland
(Vic.) farmer found himself. Part of
his property was situated on a river
which, depending on the amount of water
coming down, flowed sometimes on his
western boundary, but periodically had
the habit of “going round the back” along
the eastern boundary. Sometimes the
place was almost an island. That didn’t
bother him much, except that the river
was the boundary of two shires, with the
result that he was sometimes in one and
sometimes in the other, and got rate-
notices from both. When I knew him
he wasn’t paying either.
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”; We were quidded up
and set for a good Christmas in Warrack-
nabeal. The mob had been got out of
the pubs by about 7 p.m., and were clus-
tered, with bottles on their hips and in
gunny-bags, when the fire-bell sounded
and a police-sergeant motored along
Scott-street calling for volunteers to
stoush a bushfire on the Dimboola road.
I lost Mat in the general mix-up, and
found myself in among a lot of feet in
a lorry. Over the bridge we rattled, and
south-west to the fire, which we fell upon
with drunken enthusiasm, and presently
defeated. Then, blackened and weary, we
headed back. A trifle worried about Mat,
I made for our pub and the bathroom,
and there he was, cool and unstained,
offering me a long, lovely, cold beer.
“Where’dja get t’?” I asked, after get-
ting it down. “Who, me? Nowhere.
Just waited here till y’ come back.”
“Wasn’t y’ at the fire?” “Who, me?
Look, there was enough o’ y’ t’ eat tl;e
flamin’ fire, an’ seein’ the police was all
out t’ it I just went in the bar an’ got
this bucket o’ beer an’ brought it up here.”
I could only gape at him. “Well, cripes,”
he defended himself in hurt tones,
“ somebody’s got t’ do the thinkin’ when
everyone rushes round doin’ things. If
I’d raced out t’ the bloomin’ fire we’d ha’
had a dry Christmas Eve. As it is”
He dipped a china jug happily into the
bucket.
* * * *
“Bo”: The forked stick did seem to
be dipping emphatically in Joe’s hands,
and it so convinced Dad that he decided
to put the well down at the spot Joe
indicated. When it yielded not a drop
the old man hit the roof. “You and
your damned dowsing!” he roared. “I
don’t think you know the first thing
about it!” “Well, anyway,” said Joe
sulkily, “you see the stick dip yourself.
It wouldn’t do that unless it was over
water.” Dad slapped his leg. “Now I
know why it dips with y’,” he said, “an’
y’ should ha’ taken a wake-up yourself.
Remember that time y’ stopped the full-
back’s boot in y’r knee when y’ was
playin’ against the Goanna Bend Briars?
The. doc. said you’d have water on the
SLOW
DOWN
SCHOOL
knee. Well, it’s right under the stick yTe
carryin’—you can’t strike anything else
but water.”
* * * *
“Villefair”: I’ve never been able to
see any sense in teaching a dog to be a
clown, yet some fellows delight in it.
One chap I struck had trained his hound
to go away when he whistled or called,
and come when he hollered “Get to hell
out of here!” Whether the thing began
as a joke or was merely a method of pre-
venting the dog from chumming up with
strangers I never did find out, but I do
know that bewildered mong didn’t like it
any more than a human would like being
laughed at for no apparent reason. Still,
if the canine had known it, he was lucky
—compared with the kelpie-cattledog cross
owned by an old cocky I once en-
countered. The dog had never known a
rewarding pat, a friendly tug of the ears
or that vigorous rub along the spine that
all other tykes love. He had been trained
to hate any sort of applied affection.
Nor had his master ever been heard to
say a “smooging” word to him. Yet,
when the poor, warped-natured animal
was killed by a falling tree, the old
fellow went into a silent, brooding de-
pression that lasted for a full month.

“Mac F,”: On one of the best-
managed stations in s.-w. Queensland, the
cowboy (adult) is in no doubt as to his
duties. He is issued with this type-
written copy on arrival;
Daily except Sunday. At 5.45 a.m. clean out
kitchen fire and light, putting ashes in ash-bin.
Cut up sheep and meat for breakfast, putting
balance in refrig. Milk cows for breakfast milk.
After breakfast finish milking cows and separate,
carting all waste milk well away from house
and empty in vicinity of sheep-killing yards.
Feed fowls with warm mash and skim milk,
filling up fowls’ water tin after scrubbing clean.
Take away fowls’ bucket and waste bucket from
kitchen, afterwards scrubbing clean. Empty
waste bucket in vicinity of sheep-killing yard.
Fill up kitchen wood and kindling-box. Always
keep a good supply of split wood at the stack.
Keep butcher’s shop clean, -scrubbing block,
table and knives, removing all waste immediately
to dogs’ dish. Sweep and keep tidy all round
butcher’s shop and backyard of kitchen. On
killing-days run up ration-sheep in the morn-
ings. Keep salt-meat cask well filled with water
when not in use. Kill and dress poultry when
required. Clean windows when requued. Finish
12 noon. Start 2 p.m. and put in some time
each day in keeping garden in order, weeding
and cutting grass with lawnmower and shears.
After 3.30 p.m, feed fowls with grain and green-
feed, collect eggs and see that a supply of
shell-grit is in yard. Run in cows. Kill sheep
before dinner at night, burning all offal im-
mediately it is removed from sheep. Bring
sheepskin to butcher’s shop, next day remove
to woolshed and paint with arsenic. Saturdays,
in addition to the week-day morning jobs, take
a supply of split wood to the laundry, clean
out copper fire, putting ashes in ash drum, lay
fire and half-fill copper with water. Finish at
noon, except to run up cows, feed and water
fowls and kill sheep in evening when necessary.
Thursdays, take vegetables off coach and spread
out in safe where they are kept. Sundays,
meat and milk for breakfast. No separating.
Feed and water fowls as usual, collect eggs and
run up cows. Once a week oil barrow with
waste oil, oil saddle and bridle, wash saddle-
cloth. Sweep drain and drag bagging through
pipes, flush drain, kitchen sink and toilet with
disinfectant. Clean cobwebs from verandas.
Hose verandas when required. Clean windows
when required.
And the cowboys come and they go.

“Silver Other things besides ex-
plosive tins of fruit are apt to be left
in the stove of a seaside cottage (B.
31/10/’5l). Resuming ownership after
a long tenancy by a noted sport,
who had seemingly left a couple of days
before his time and failed to surrender
the key, I was surprised to receive an
urgent telegram: “Do not light fire in
cottage.” Which, as it happened, I had
not done ; being hot weather I was using
the primus. A couple of days later the
mystery was explained by the arrival of
my late tenant, heavily bandaged and
limping. He had brought his brother
along as a witness. Going straight to the
small ash-door just below the oven, he
raked around for a few seconds with
the bent poker and produced a fat roll of
notes. Belonging to a coterie which
alternated nights of poker and other
games around the cottages the members
were renting, he had been using the space
in the bottom of the stove as a safe;
which wasn’t a bad idea, since the summer
heat made it impossible to sleep inside
with the doors closed. Then had come
a road smash in which he and his wife
had been “cleaned up,” though not too
badly. Waking to consciousness in a
Perth hospital he had recalled his plant
of notes.
SONG OF THE DIESELIERS.
Swing to the cabin and press the switch
And give the diesel the gun,
It’s three hundred miles to the Border bridge
And we must be there with the sun.
And whether they wait for bottles or bricks,
Or spuds or steel or lime,
They never doubt that the truckie’s skill
Will get them there on time.
We cop the blame for the broken roads,
We’re chivvied and chased by cops,
And eyed askance in the quiet towns
Where we gulp down pies and chops.
We’re taxed for this and we’re taxed for that,
And cursed as a highway blight,
But a thousand tons of goods will move
Five hundred miles tonight.
The mines may strike and the railways halt
And a hundred ships may stop,
But your kids will eat and your goods arrive
On a dusty trailer-top.
And somewhere tonight in the lonely dark
A truckie is bathed in sweat,
Changing a wheel or an axle stub
Or swapping a dust-choked jet.
We’ve wives and kids of our own, ’tis true,
Though sailors see more of theirs,
For we live ’neath a cabin’s shuddering roof
On a floor full of pedals and gears.
With dust in our mouths and oil in our veins
And grease in out sinful souls,
We roar to the south or the west or the north,
Glued to a diesel’s controls.
With cars for Sydney or beer for Bourke;
With washing-machines for Nhill;
Cement for Gympte or Charters Towers;
And boots for Broken Hill.
Whyalla is stuck for a load of tiles,
Port Fairy is out of nails,
There’s a red dust-cloud on the Condo road
Where a truckie goes with rails.
Twin swords of light on a mountain road
And a roar that shakes the night
As an eighteen-wheeler thunders on,
Its load lashed trim and tight.
There are twenty tons of water-pipes
On the eight-by-forty deck —
And the roan who clings to the bucking wheel
Is risking his ruddy neck.
If a booster fails on a winding steep
Or the offside rear wheels blow,
She’ll swipe the cabin and overturn
Into the valley below.
But maybe she won’t, with skill and with luck,
So give the engine the gun,
It’s a long three hundred to Albury’s bridge,
And we must get there with the sun.

“K.A.”; The year just closing was not
Without its usual crop of unusual
accidents involving animals. A Laun-
ceston (Tas.) cow died through trying to
masticate a tennis-ball. Administering
medicine to an ailing cow at Avoca
(Vic.), its owner was suddenly homed
by the animal, which then knocked him
down and fell on him. A horse on a
Dandenong (Vic.) property was killed
when a lightning-bolt struck its stall
located beneath a pine-tree, its legs being
severed at fhe stifle-joint. Camping at
Palm Beach (N.SJW.), a man was knocked
out by a dog, which was tied to the pole
of the tent in which he was sleeping, and
which was pulled down when, at night,
the dog set off in pursuit of a cat.
Bounding across a road near Casino
(N.S.W.) a kangaroo got itself caught in
the steering-gear beneath a passing truck.
The passengers of the truck suffered
shock, while the ’roo had to be destroyed.
A hunter near Perth hit a wounded
kangaroo with the butt of his rifle, which
exploded ; the hunter was killed instantly.
At Lake Boga (Vic.) a lizard ran up the
trouser-leg of a guard hauling on a point-
lever, As a result some trucks ran off
the line, ripped up rails, while neither
man nor lizard suffered any ill effects.

“Edx”: Old Fred slammed down the
women’s magazine in which he had been
ploughing through the weekly column of
psychologist’s guff. “Funny names those
doctor blokes make up for ordinary
things,” he said. “You take that sheezo
—sizzer —thing What? Yair, schizo-
phrenia they talk about. I saw a bad
case of that once a good few years back
and no one ever called it that. Even
when they put it in the papers they only
said Tom’d got killed.” Everyone
looked mystified as Fred continued.
“You blokes wouldn’t know v Tom, He
had a goldmine out Laverton way. He
was down pretty deep, and when a new-
chum drifted along Tom gave him a
job on the windlass. One day Tom was
timbering down at the bottom and he
yells up the shaft to the offsider to send
down the axe. Instead of sending it
doivn in the bucket like a human being
the useless newchum just grabs the axe
and drops it down the shaft.” There was
complete silence for several seconds, and
someone said, “But what’s that got to
do with schizophrenia, Fred?” “Well,”
said Fred easily. “By the time we got
poor old Tom laid out up on the
surface the quack was there, but it didn’t
need a doctor with long words to tell us
that old Tom was the best example any-
one there’d ever seen of split personality.”
* * * *
“Herbert Dawson”; Hugh Sawry, of
—Allah, give me strength!—Queens-
land, should be arraigned before the
Supreme Court of Rights and Privileges
of the Aboliars’ Association in respect
to his verse “The Barebacked Kid” (B.
21/11/ ’5l), a more suitable title of which
would have been “The Barefaced Liar.”
If “H.S.” has worn riding-boots for any
cfther purpose than square-dancing it has
been in localities where either scrubbers
didn’t exist or where he never rode fast
enough to see them two seconds after
the “jump-off.” There never was, or ever
will be, a mob of scrubbers or anything
else with hides and horns that, starting
“like a flash of light,” could be run
through a “seven-mile stretch of scrub,”
to say nothing of “the flat with the
melon-holes” or “the last two miles to
the Holdfast yards.” After that little
spurt “swinging them into the Holdfast
yards” is, of course, quite in character.
Such a verse, apart from its virtues
purely as verse, is calculated to give
youngsters without experience a wholly
misleading idea of how wild cattle are
and can be handled. No boss not quite
off his head would permit one man with
or without dogs to tackle such a job
as the barebacked kid did. It only
stands to reason that the more times cattle
are run and escape the worse to handle
they become. A mile is a pretty good
run for any scrubber mob. Before the
mile is thrown behind, the cattle, feeling
the pressure, split up and bail up. It
would take a good team of men to yard
scrubbers that had been run even half a
mile, except into trapyards with long
Wings. But to get a mob of roguish
scrubbers out of an extensive scrub, in
which they had previously been unsuc-
cessfully run, without coaehers and with-
out “throwing and tying”—merely to
get them out —would be a task so far
beyond a barebacked kid or an experi-
enced scrub-rider (who, of course, wouldn’t
be fool enough to tackle it) as to be
wholly fantastic. One line of the verse,
however, did ring true: “The bush kid
climbed from his weary mare.” She
would be weary after that run.
* * * *
“K.”: “Donks?” he said, putting him-
self against the wall for comparative ease
and feeling for his tobacco. “I could
write a book about ’em if I could write
a book. Especially about working donks
in the Salient. I remember when Dicke-
busch looked like it was the donks’ native
land, there were so many of them. Our
ammo column had a seasoned mob of
them, wise as they make ’eip, but the
daddy of the lot for lookin’ after himself
was little Anzac. A black little b
he was, about twelve hands, and the
hitchin’s that donk could get out of,
headstalls, neckropes, legropes—l tell you
Houdini had nothing on him. We tried
wishin’ him off on the Tommies more
than once, but he wouldn’t stay with
them. One foggy day in the Salient —
good sort of day for going up the line
except for gasrshells—l took him for-
ward with some ammo. He made a first-
class bleedin’ nuisance of himself goin£
up, and when I’d delivered his load ]
took the* harness off him, gave him a
belt on the rump and started him off
for the Fritz lines. He didn’t come back,
though I hung round the battery for a
bit swappin’ unwarlike opinions with a
few blokes, so back 1 goes with their
ration-party, fetches up at the column,
and tells them: ‘Well, I got rid of little
Anzac at last; the Fritzies can put up
with him now.’ Then they laughed like
hell, because noseying about over at the
water-point was little Anzac. The little
cow had beaten me home!”
* * * *
“Old-timer”: Old Mac was on top of
the nearly-finished haystack when a big
willy-willy rushed up. Young Fred, on
the wagon, jumped for the reins, missed
them and fell overboard. The team
plunged and went across the hay-yard, a
corner of the hay-frame picking up the
ladder as it passed and dragging it away
from the stack. The willy-willy bored
into the stack like a corkscrew, and
sheaves flew in all directions. Fred
picked himself up and ran after the team,
now circling the yard at a half-gallop.
On the spinning stack old Mac tried to
hold down as much hay as possible. Fred
made the wagon and climbed in the back.
He had just clawed up the reins when
the wagon hit the sou’-west corner of the
stack, and down came half the hay, old
Mac in the middle of it. As he wriggled
out he met the angry glare of his son,
who demanded, “Whyinell didjer want
t’ come down? I can handle the ruddy
horses. You’re always the same, puttin’
y’r frame in. Now look what y’ done —
brought down half the flamin’ stack with
y’.” Mac studied Fred for a second, then
mildly said, “Oh, well, we better get over
t’ the house. Mum’ll have the rnornin’
tea ready be this.”
* * * *
“Carver”: Generalisation is a very
slippery footbridge on the way to truth,
even when traversed by the expert. In a
magazine article David Fleay wrote that
the brown snake (Demansia textilis) “is
very strictly, diurnal, loving the hot,
sizzling day ;... .it never wanders abroad
even on the hottest nights.” That may
be true of shivery regions like Victoria;
it is totally false when applied, say, to
the warmer parts of S.A. And it is a
dangerous statement, because the wanderer
after dark is likely to tread with false
security in the tracks of the expert, and
fairly on to the abdomen of J. Blake,
notoriously an unforgiving fellow in
moments of excitement. All through the
north of S.A. the sight *f a brown snake
in the open in daytime is quite rare once
the hot weather has set in. This might
be attributed to the fact that both spring
time hunger and the restlessness of th
mating season have passed, leaving th
ophidian population less inclined t
travel. Observation of any area knowi
to harbor a number of browns tells
different story. Through September and
October snakes sunning, hunting o
travelling will be a common sight. In
November and December you can poke
about safely in the haunt, as long as the
sun is high. Then if you want snakes
go for a walk at sunset and you’ll see
fresh tracks streaking away from rabbit
warrens and cracked ground. The long
blokes themselves will be energetically
poking around the local mouse-nests. li
the weather is really hot, the hunters
won’t emerge tiff an hour or so after
dark, when the ground has cooled suffi-
ciently to allow comfortable travelling.
Any country dweller knows that it is at
night that J, Blake faffs into the home-
stead underground tank,
* * * *
“Double-G.”: Here is strong evidence,
from the U.S.A., to support the up-with-
the-tree school of thought. For many
years lumbermen on the Blue Mountains
of eastern Oregon had been puzzled by
the ghostly tolling of a bell that could
never be tracked down, the sounds, never
very strong, fading as the wind dropped.
Comments on what the hearer had been
drinking were in order. But recently
during the clearing of a way for a power-
line from the Bonneville Dam a tall pine
was brought down. Tied by a shrivelled
leather thong high in the tree top was
the solution of the mystery —a bronze
cattle-bell, with the date 1878 inscribed.
Its clapper was worn smooth and flat.
It is supposed that a pioneer tied the bell
to a sapling that grew to a towering tree.

“Mike”: With snapper fetching around
4s. per pound on today’s market, any man
who makes a 10001 b. catch in the course
of a single day’s fishing should be worthy
of hitting the headlines. But before the
income-tax vultures start to sharpen their
talons, let it be known that that feat was
accomplished back at the turn of the
century, when snapper sold over the
counter at 3d. per pound. The fisherman
was a professional, Bob Palmer, who
recently passed on, and he got the catch in
Westernport Bay at Corinella, opposite
French Island penal settlement. His boat,
Mabel, in which he fished and also
carried mails and passengers twice weekly
across to Stony Point, is stiff at Corinella
in seaworthy condition, after 66 years of
hard service.

“Sam”: The goat’s aversion, internally
and externally, to water (B. 4/7/’5l)
comes from its natural environment —
rocky mountains. One I owned didn’t
drink, so far
as I knew,
for 10 months
after wean-
ing. I made
the milker
drink by put-
ting a tomato
in water
(c 1 e a n 1 i-
ness essen-
tial) ; she
had to re-
move the
water to get
the tit - bit.
With plenty of greenfeed available, how-
ever, water is unnecessary. You could
also apply water externally every day, but
the ripe effluvium surrounding William
wouldn’t become one whit less ripe.
TWO LANDSCAPES.
O unbelievable perfection of
This calendar-scene ail ready for the painter,
Pastures of flat green, the knee-deep kine,
Old Human Interest with red neckerchief,
The slanting hut, romantic bridge a-totter,
Curved rib of river, willows nicely spaced
And middle-distance township poplar-guarded;
O slopes smooth and symmetrical, rich trees
Massed carefully upon a static sky.
But I, the traveller, must go on my way,
Return to my harsh country; not for me
The easy conquest of lush constancy,
And in tircse years of drought nothing but dust
To shroud the naked trees on red-baked hills,
To cover the lonely stretches of brown earth,
To pale the fierce sky, the blood-eyed sun,
And blur the ghostly shapes of sheep and emus
Beside a burnt-sienna waterhole:
O sad and ravaged land, yet eager to yield
Green-sheathed and gracious, in her years of
grace.

WINNING THE PEACE.
This is traditionally the “silly
season” in the British Press. So
the air of hopeful expectancy
for 1952, very noticeable just
now, may suddenly change. But
there is no doubt about its
prevalence as this year draws to
a close.
It centres direct on two men
—the Churchill-Eden combina-
tion. Mr. Churchill’s pending
visit to Mr. Truman is widely
expected to somehow bring
peace nearer. Both Mr. Churchill
and Mr, Eden are expected to
improve international relations
generally.
Oddly enough, Mr. Churchill
is reported to have had almost
favorable handling by Russian
papers and radio. Moscow, Lon-
don “Economist” has noted, had
“even hinted that it might be
easier to negotiate with Mr.
Churchill than with Mr. Attlee.”
“Temporarily at least,” it also
reported, “Mr. Churchill is no
longer shown as the leader of
the anti-Soviet crusade, but as a
statesman with whom it is pos-
sible to talk.” And it added this
interpretation;
“It is very unlikely that the
Russians really hope by these
methods to win over Mr.
Churchill or introduce a wedge
into the Anglo-American alli-
ance. The new Soviet policy
has probably a different aim. It
is clear that Stalin does not ex-
pect any real agreement to be
reached in the open forum of
the United Nations. His hopes
of agreement, if any, are pinned
on more secluded negotiations
between the leaders of the Great
Powers. And, if these are to
take place, opinion in the Soviet
Union and among Communists
outside it has to be gently
prepared.”
NO CHANGE
No one suggests that there has
been any real change in British
foreign policy. “There is in
Britain,” the “News Chronicle”
has commented, “much more
agreement about foreign policy
than might have been thought
by those who observed the
recent election from outside.”
And the “Spectator,” while
asserting that “a new chapter
has definitely opened,” hastens
to add that it is new rather as
regards method than aim,
“Mr. Eden,” the “Spectator”
has also commented, “believes
in anticipating events, and, so
far as may be, shaping them, not
waiting to cope with them as
best may be when they happen.
Under his guidance relations
with the United States, on which,
before all things, world-peace
depends, promise to be increas-
ingly cordial and increasingly
intimate.”
“Mr. Eden’s speeches in Paris
and Parliament,” Vernon Bart-
lett has written in the “News
Chronicle,” have caused “mil-
lions of people in scores of
countries to turn with new hope
towards Britain, Here, it seems
to them, is a man who remem-
bers that the aim of diplomacy
is rather to reach agreement
than Jo score victories.”
EDEN SPEAKS
Mr. Eden himself has made
two relevant, most significant,
statements. Appealing to the
Russians at U.N.O, in Paris, he
said :
“I do not believe, or ask you
to believe, that in any dispute
one party is 100 per cent, a
black villain and the other 100
per cent, snow white. That’s
against the law of averages. All
men are fallible, and peace can
only rest on mutual forebear-
ance and restraint. Should we
not, then, do much better to
proclaim a truce to name-calling
and angry words? Could we
not, instead, apply our minds
dispassionately to serious prob-
lems? I am sure that we
should. Shall we try from now
on?”
In the House of Commons he
said: “I believe that if we can
take a number of definite but
limited problems and agree
among the Big Four, or others,
to discuss and seek to solve even
one of them, then, even now, we
can move into a wider and more
hopeful field. There is no
originality in this idea, but, in
my judgment, it is the only one
holding out any real hope of
success....,! am ready at any
time to meet my colleagues in
Paris, or anywhere, not for a
wide general discussion or sterile
debate, but to seek to solve some
specific problem which today
divides us.”
U.S. SCEPTICISM
British Press optimism in-
spired by the Church ill-Eden
lead is not shared in America.
As far as Russia goes, the Yanks
have had ’em. Typically, “New
York Times” has commented on
Mr. Eden’s advocacy of a piece-
meal and step-by-step approach
to the central problem by
tackling smaller and limited but
concrete issues first:
“In removing immediate
points of friction, as in Berlin
or Korea, this is, of course, the
only approach possible. But as
an approach to peace with
totalitarian regimes it confronts
the world with a dilemma. Mr.
Eden himself tried this method
before the last war without
stemming the course to catas-
trophe, and the Western Powers
tried it after the war, especially
in the Balkan treaties, without
preventing Soviet expansion.
“What seems clear from this
experience is that any agree-
ments with totalitarian regimes,
whether on limited or over-all
problems, are worth while only
if there is power to command
respect for them. To build that
power is now the first task and
duty of the free world,
“When that power has been
built there is at least a hope that
durable settlements can be
reached on both the larger prob-
lems and the limited issues
which are integral parts of
them.”
Churchill for Peace.
In London “Times’s” view, it
will be seen by historians as an
extraordinary perversion that
Mr. Churchill should have come
to be regarded by so many critics
and opponents in politics as a
man eager for war and a crusted
Tory.
Actually, “Perhaps because so
much of his fame and character
has been made with un-
common zeal and gusto —in the
midst of world carnage his
thought has always been, be-
tween the wars, upon the means
of making peace among the
peoples.
“So, too, in his chequered
political career, he has never
been either the creature or the
leader of any party sect; rather,
from his rich experience in
Parliament and in government,
he has come to look more and
more for the community of men
of goodwill in serving the
nation’s interests at home and
abroad.”
Stalinist Myth.
In his latest book on the
subject on which he is an out-
standing expert, The New Soviet
Empire, David J. Dallin pursues
the theme that Stalin relies on
his “power machinery,” is con-
temptuous of “ideological
factors.”
Hitler, Dallin points out,
showed films emphasising the
might of the Wehrmacht in
countries about to be absorbed ;
Stalin’s victories are similarly
based on spreading a belief in
his infallibility and the impossi-
bility of opposing the mighty
Soviet Union.
The task of the free world,
Dallin argues, is to destroy that
legend. Instead of providing
opportunities for graceful with-
drawal, as was done when
Russia was compelled to raise
the Berlin blockade, it should be
made unmistakably clear when
Russian policies suffer a major
setback.
The disintegration of the
Soviet regime will occur, Dallin
—London “News Chronicle."
THE MORE IT CHANGES, THE MORE IT REMAINS THE SAME.
believes, as a result of large-
scale defections by important
groups and personalities within
the ruling party. If the free
world, by steadfast opposition to
Communist expansion wherever
this occurs, finally destroys the
myth of Stalinist mastery, “the
gravediggers of Communism
will be party members singing
Leninist songs as they inter it.”
Wool Rivals.
Reporting recent developments
of synthetic fibres in America, a
London “Financial Times”
writer thinks they “may well
mean further eclipse of such
natural products as wool and
cotton.”
Spurred by rearmament needs
“a vast synthetic-fibre pro-
gramme is definitely emerging,”
the latest laboratory and manu-
facturing developments making
it clear that the fibres “are not
only ready to invade the last
stronghold of natural ones —
woollen goods—but that they
are winning this battle to an
increasing extent,”
Half a dozen of the huge
chemical companies, the writer
reports, have perfected synthetic
fibres which appear to “match
the best qualities of wool, and
in most cases offer additional
advantages Indeed, the
variety of woollen synthetics
being offered and planned is
such that ultimate success of one
or more on a global scale seems
virtually assured.”
Quoted opinion is that one-
half of current American wool
consumption in clothing, apparel
and home furnishings such as
upholstery and carpets may well
be replaced by synthetics within
the present decade.
London “Economist” has re-
ported “a growing demand for
these new fibres,” adding that
nylon output is now running at
an annual rate of 100 million
pounds, and it may not be long
before this figure is reached by
the wool substitutes.
The “Economist’s’* opinion,
however, is that, “while these
new developments obviously
present a serious long-term
threat to wool producers, and
will certainly exercise a restrain-
ing influence on prices, they will
not necessarily supplant wool
altogether.”
The Rather Red Dean.
In a London “Sunday Times”
letter, John Baker White, M.P.,
listed some of the objec-
tions to Dr. Hewlett Johnson’s
remaining Dean of Canterbury:
“The Dean is on the editorial
board of the official organ of
the Communist party.
“He is an active worker for
the British Peace Committee,
denounced by the Archbishop of
Canterbury and the World
Council of Churches as a Com-
munist creation with purely revo-
lutionary motives.
“He appears frequently on
the platforms of ancillaries of
the Communist party, sometimes
on the Sabbath.
“He has accused British and
American soldiers of committing
atrocities in Korea.
“Above all there is his con-
stant reiteration of the state-
ment that Communism in prac-
tice in Russia —complete as it is
with secret police, interrogation
by physical and mental torture
and the merciless persecution of
minorities —is Christian. He has,
indeed, suggested on more than
one occasion that Russian Com-
munism is infinitely preferable
to, and more Christian than,
British democracy,”
To which a footnote may be
added from a long “Sunday
Chronicle” article by Beverley
Nichols, addressing the Dean
personally (very);
“But one achievement I will
grant y0u....y0u have done
something which no uther Dean
has managed to do throughout
the centuries. You have renamed
the cathedral. In Canterbury it
is no longer called the Cathedral.
It is called ‘the Church of Saint
Marx and all Engels.’ ”
Dragnet Digest.
Of Australia’s Confusion. —
Australian journalist Brian May,
in a London “Observer” article:
“The one heartening sign that
has emerged from Australia’s
confusion in the last decade is
that in a British democracy
national necessity rather than
class or party prejudice is likely
to determine policy in the long
run.”
A War Danger. —A London
“Spectator” writer quotes a
U.S. businessman: “The Ameri-
cans want peace, but I think war
is inevitable because we cannot
stand these harassing tactics for
twenty years. Even war would
be better than that.” And, the
writer adds, “There lies the
danger. In the long run the
great American people can be
relied on to do the right thing,
but in the short run they may
say or do the wrong thing, and
there are many powder-barrels
about.”
Liquidated Chinese. —London
“Economist,” on the “large-
scale liquidations” in Communist
China: “According to the official
figures, 100,000 people have
been shot, and the true figure
may well be two or three times
higher.”
Migrated Scots. Just on
16,000 Scots emigrated last year,
notes the Edinburgh “Scots-
man,” quoting latest available
figures. Australia, it adds, took
about half of them, with Canada
and the U.S. next, then N.Z,
Prof. Oliphanfs Bomb.
London “Daily Express,” hear-
ing of Professor Oliphanfs
remark that in a Russia-West
war “Australia may easily be
considered expendable,” is highly
indignant: “This is outrageous
nonsense. The integrity of the
Empire is one and indivisible.
The professor should stick to his
laboratory, where he can under-
stand what goes on.”
Taft Rejects U.N.O. —Ameri-
can Presidential candidate
Senator Taffs blunt declaration
that the U.S. could never rely
again upon the United Nations
as a means of preventing aggres-
sion is interpreted by a “New
York Times” Washington cor-
respondent as underlining the
politically significant fact that,
for the first time since 1920,
foreign policy might well be a
major issue in the next Presi-
dential election. It certainly
foreshadows vast changes if
Taft is nominated and wins.
Churchill Not Safe. A
London “Observer” writer, com-
menting on the British Cabinet
appointments: “The knowledge
that Mr. Churchill is not really
a ‘safe’ Conservative, and that
he became leader of the Con-
servative party not by the party’s
deliberate choice but by the
pressure of events, is never far
below the surface in any Con-
servative discussion.” He added
that it had been “brought out
into the open with some bitter-
ness” in the course of forming
the Cabinet.
Overtime Ham. Opposing
the food cuts as a remedy for
Britain’s troubles, “Manchester
Guardian” argues that no one
will really feel he is helping the
country because ham-sandwiches
are harder to come by: “Is a
plate of ham worth an hour’s
overtime? That is the question
that people should be asked to
answer.”
Independent Germans.
“There is hardly any danger of
the Germans lining-up with
Russia against the West.” So
thinks American historian Hans
Kohn, in a London “Time and
Tide”' article. He accepts that
there’s probably some strong
German feeling for German-
Slav economic co-operation:
“But on the whole German self-
confidence is too great to agree
to any subordinate role in a
Slav or Communist orbit. Much
stronger is the German attitude
which expects salvation neither
from ‘Eastern Satanism’ nor
from ‘Western Humanism.’ ”
Vyshinsky’s Mouse. —“Man-
chester Guardian” has noted &
significant sequel to Vyshinsky s
description of the West’s dis-
armament plan as “a dead
mouse” which made him laugh
so much that he couldn’t sleep:
In an otherwise verbatim report
of the speech, “Pravda” omitted
that bit.
Bad as Joe.— “Philadelphia
Inquirer” takes a poor view of
the hero of Yugoslavia: “As a
trouble-maker for the Kremlin,
as a potential fighter against
Russian aggression, Tito is
valuable to us. As the leader or
a political movement, he’s no
better than Stalin.”
Comparative Television, y
From a letter featured m
London “Times’s” correspond-
ence columns: “The only _un-
prejudiced conclusion that it | s
possible for anyone to draw lS
that television as a major
medium of entertainment, dis-
semination of news and instruc-
tion is now fully established in
the United States and saaw
does not exist here [in Britain!
at all.”

"BRIGADOON.”
Somewhere in the Highlands,
it would appear, there is, or,
rather, was —and should be
again in about 85 years—the
town of Brigadoon, which, back
in 1735, was in such dire peril
of succumbing to the sinful ways
of the outside world that its
minister, the Reverend Forsyth,
went into the woods and prayed
mightily for a miracle to save
his flock.
His wish was granted, and
when the townsfolk went to
sleep that night their town
vanished somewhere into the
safety of the limbo for a hun-
dred years. When it materialised
again, in a world a century
older, its inhabitants had, of
course, only aged to the extent
of a good night’s sleep—the
problem of insomniacs is not
dealt with. Then, after their day
of waking, the villagers went to
sleep for another night, the
village disappeared into its time-
less sanctuary and the outside
world went on its wicked way
for another hundred years.
The last occasion of Briga-
doon’s awakening was in 1935,
when the place was stumbled
upon by two American tourists,
who are justifiably bewildered to
find a town where a mainly
youthful and healthy population
count a couple of hundred years
ago as only the day before
yesterday. Their arrival coin-
cides with one or two interest-
ing events, such as the wedding
of young Jean Mac Keith and
Charlie Cameron, who, by nor-
mal chronological standards, be-
came engaged in 1735 or there-
abouts, but seem none the worse
for wear.
A further momentous event of
1935 is the rebellion of young
Harry Ritchie. One of the con-
ditions of Brigadoon’s survival
is that none shall leave, the
penalty for any such breach
being the complete and final
disappearance of the town.
Harry, it seems, was a university
student back in 1735, and has
been brooding for 200 years, or
at least a couple of days, over
the miracle which has deprived
him of his education. That, and
the wedding of young Jean Mac-
Keith, whom he fancies for him-
self, bring him to the spiteful
frame of mind where he decides
to consign the village and its
people to everlasting space by
hotfooting it to the outside
world. Fortunately for the vil-
lage and unfortunately for
science, he is pursued through
the forest so purposefully by
the young men of Brigadoon
that he stumbles and cracks his
skull, thus becoming the subject
for a wailing lament by a couple
of pipers and a very graceful
little dance of grief by a lass who
loved him.
The third complication of
Brigadoon’s 1935 awakening is
brought about by Tommy Al-
bright, one of the Americans,
who falls very hard for young
Fiona Mac Keith, Since a further
provision of Brigadoon’s miracle
allows that true love for any of
its inhabitants will enable a
stranger to become a member of
the town, it only remains for
young Tommy to consign him-
self into the hundred-years-wide
abyss. At the last moment he
dingoes it and hies himself back
to New York with his com-
panion, leaving poor Fiona to
cry in her sleep for the next 100
years.
In New York, however, young
Tommy finds that neither the
bright lights nor the blondes can
compensate him for the graces
of Fiona, and, after crying into
bis highballs for three or four
months, recrosses the Atlantic,
no doubt wondering if Professor
Einstein can juggle time and
space sufficiently to find and get
him into sleeping Brigadoon.
The professor is not needed,
however, for such is the ache in
Tommy’s heart that it awakens
the sympathetic schoolteacher of
Brigadoon, who emerges from
the mystery of time and ushers
the young man back with him
into the limbo, where, no doubt,
after a very brief engagement,
he will wed the lovely Fiona in
2035, or, if the proprieties must
be observed, a couple of cen-
turies after that.
Such is the history of Briga-
doon as related by producer
James MacGregor Jamieson on
the stage at Sydney Royal per
courtesy of J. C. Williamson. It
is all told to the accompaniment
of whirling kilted dancers, a
string of light, lilting ditties and
an occasional touch of comedy
provided mainly by Olive
Lucius as a lass wi’out a laddie
and very concerned about it, and
by Peter Turgeon, a blond
young man who plays the
second member of the American
invasion of Brigadoon and who
models his humor generally
along lines made familiar and
effective by James Stewart.
The cast is well - balanced
rather than brilliant. In their
dancing producer Jamieson, who
also appears as young Harry
Ritchie, and Virginia Richard-
son as the lass who mourns him,
are probably the most outstand-
ing members of the show. The
others —including Ken Cantrill
and Gwen Overton as Tommy
and Fiona, and Lionel Baker
and Shirley Fraser as Charlie
Cameron and Jean MacKeith —
sing and act safely within the
margins that one accords to
musical comedy.
Sketch Club.
One thing that can always be
said for the stragglers or
beginners of Jos. Holloway’s
Sketch Club is that they don’t
try to come up and take the
town by storm, as others some-
times do, but stay modestly in
their bohemian retreat round the
corner from the Capitol Theatre,
Sydney, in the region of Chinese
restaurants and the Tiv.
It’s a show where there’s
always a chance of seeing the
first efforts of some young
painter who is going to be
important later on ; and if there’s
no new sunrise apparent this
year, there’s at least one paint-
ing by one of the group’s former
habituds to make a visit worth-
while ; Garrett Kingsley’s
enchanting little portrait of
“Rita,” as sound in technique as
it is alive with sensitive feeling.
There is some mild merit —
among much that is best passed
over quickly—in R. Tulloch’s
watercolor landscapes and Frank
Jessup’s “Dolan’s Bay”; Jos.
Holloway’s watercolors of
“Squatter’s Castle” and “Coral
Trees” have a freshness lacking
in his oils; but the paintings
most worth looking at after
Garrett Kingsley’s are minor
works by other established
artists: a rather sombre Lance
Solomon which would look
much better if it weren’t in a
white frame, and two of
Salvana’s admirable small
landscapes.
Period Prints.
At his Collins-street gallery
Joshua McClelland has caught
the Christmas market with a
fascinating show of old color
prints and lithos from the
Georgian and Victorian epochs,
as well as early Australian
views, civil and military
costumes, sporting, shipping and
birds and flowers and modern
prints after Renoir, Degas and
Lautrec.
The early engravers were as
great in their craft as the
painters, and the best of them
were courted by all the leading
painters. The camera has
altered all that, and today,
although we get likeness, we
don’t get the lifelikeness that we
see in the lithographs of
cathedrals of Louis Haghe, one
of the first masters of the art,
and in the European views of
R. Bowyer.
Some men almost as good,
like Skinner Prout, Chevalier,
Wood, Walton and Gill,
migrated to Australia and gave
us as faithful pictures of Sydney,
Melbourne and Hobart. They
didn’t think of themselves as
creative or great artists or
seekers of new forms, in the
modern manner, but as simple
craftsmen; but will our
moderns, with their queer distor-
tions, leave as fine a record?
Gill’s colored views, like
“Post Office, Melbourne” and
“City Police Station and Town
Hall,” make one feel that Mel-
bourne was a more dignified city
in 1851 than it is in 1951, though
now, of course, the drains are
better. Even the maps, like Rap-
kin’s Sydney Cove, Swan River
and Port of South Australia,
were works of art.

Oldest and largest of the private trading
banks, the ’Wales continues to move
from strength to strength. In a broad
and penetrating analysis of current
economic and financial trends its presi-
dent, Martin Mcllrath, successful business-
man and able banker, sounds a note of
warning, criticises the central bank’s
credit-freeze policy, advocates freer use
of indirect financial measures rather than
direct physical controls, and expresses
confidence in the long-term future of
Australia. Commenting on business con-
ditions he said, among other things:
The immediate national outlook is one of
serious difficulty. The inflationary effects of
a policy of rapid economic expansion and
defence preparation are far from spent. Yet
we cannot but feel confidence in the long-
term future of Australia Hot-house
conditions for industrial growth have shel-
tered secondary industries from an effective
test of their ability to compete with over-
seas imports... .No attack upon costs offers
hope of success without reconsidering wage-
fixation in a condition of overfull employ-
ment.... As the Commonwealth Govern-
ment is now responsible for five shillings in
the pound of national expenditure, its deci-
sions dominate the economy To offset
the loss of civilian production occasioned
by withdrawal of men and materials to
defence, the Government rightly aimed at a
large Budget surplus. But its object of
reducing inflationary pressure is defeated if
the surplus is diverted to finance public
works for which loan funds may not be
forthcoming... .The irrefutable fact is that
contemplated public-works schemes far
outstrip both current resources and the
capacity to finance them without either
credit expansion or a virtual prohibition on
industrial investment.
Then came these remarks about the
nature of credit-control:
The central bank’s operation of its
powers of control has narrowed and
diminished the scope of bank activities.
Further attempts to enforce a greater degree
of rigidity will react to the serious detri-
ment of national development in the widest
sense.... If the current season brings a sub-
stantially diminished export income and
rising imports, while costs in Australian
industry continue to mount, the demand
for advances for essential production may
provoke a, crisis in the central bank’s tight-
money policy. Insistence of the central
bank on limitation of individual advances
and the rigid segregation of borrowing
requirements, narrowly defining that part
which the banks may finance, are creating
a system of split borrowing and are threaten-
ing the traditional and invaluable flexibility
of the Australian banking system.
Cabinet is now said to favor
more elasticity in respect of both
capital issues and credit-control, but
has yet to weigh the considered
views of the Treasury and Com-
monwealth Bank before making a pro-
nouncement. The problem facing official
policy on credit and capital investment is
not so much how to prevent totals from
rising in the immediate future as how to
reduce some of the individual items so
as to make room for others judged more
urgent. The private trading banks are
in every way better equipped than the
central bank to screen individual appli-
‘ cants in the light of broad official policy,
and detail should be left to them, not
to the central bank as at present.
The ultimate success of the Govern-
ment’s credit-restriction policy will
depend a good deal on how the detail of
it is administered.
The rapid increase in incomes, especi-
slly from exports, was mainly responsible
for the growth of £68,569,474 in the
’Wales deposits, etc., last term—the
etcetera is an unspecified provision, be-
lieved to be substantial, for doubtful debts
and other contingencies:

by £2,000,000, and Government securities,
etc. (£20,964,351) by £15,166,839. These
front-line items, largely subject to central-
bank control, were run down to provide
funds for borrowers. Advances increased
by £45,427,612, but they were still only
38.9 p.c. of deposits, etc., of which liquids
were equal to 63.6 p.c. It is an exception-
ally strong position from a banking point
of view. The amount on special deposit
with the Commonwealth Bank and
Resei ve Bank of New Zealand was
£152,102,584, equal to 32.5 p.c. of total
assets.
Despite a sharp increase in the wage
bill and other exes., and after allowing
for taxation and all other contingencies,
the years profit was £106,216 stronger at
£954,006, best for the last 22 years. It
was 6 p.c. on shareholders’ funds (capital
and reserves combined), or 10.8 p.c. on
capital alone as against 9.6, 8.4, 8.3 and
7 p.c. back to 1947. The div. was kept
at 8 p.c. The bulk of the profit appears
to have come from investments, and is
likely to until an increase in lending-rates
is authorised.
The price of the co.’s £4O shares paid to
£2O the other £2O is a reserve liability
callable only if needed on liquidation—
dropped from £5l in January, 1951, to
£47 15s. in March, strengthened to £5O ss.
m May and then eased steadily to £4l 10s
last week. The return at £4l 10s. is
3.9 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis, with satis-
factory long-term prospects.

Evidence before the royal commission

Most of them are operated on the tied-
house system, which is the form compe-
tition takes, there being no price-cutting
in the trade. Rentals and bonuses are
fixed according to takings and the length
of the lease. And, except in border areas,
inter-State brewers do not invade each
other’s territory to any extent worth
bothering about.
For over a decade expanding output
and turnover have more than taken care
of the mounting cost of labor, raw
materials and distribution. However,
“the position has now been reached
where rising costs have more than
absorbed the profit from increased turn-
over,” chairman R. J, Vicars says. For
the year to June 30 last output of beer
m Australia increased by 17 million gal-
lons (10.9 p.c.), reaching a record 173
million gallons, or more than 20 gallons
per head of ‘population. The spring in
Tooth s gross earnings for the year to
September 30 was £481,939, or 15.5 p.c.

igner figure, making the average distri-
bution over the past 49 years approxi-
mately 10£ p.c., and for the last do
of them 13.3 p.c.
The Treasury, not the brewer, gets the
benefit of the recent lift of 2s. 7d. a gallon
m excise on beer, which was passed on
to the hotelkeeper and over the counter
to the public. The Government now makes
oil with 16s. of every pound the brewer
receives for bulk beer. The other 4s. has
to cover spiralling wage and other costs,
including income tax.
Although output and consumption
ot beer continue on the up-grade,
and the Royal visit should give
spending a temporary boost, appear-
ances are that, before long, people will
have less loose cash in their pockets.
Much therefore depends upon how soon
the costs curve flattens out and upon
whether brewers are granted a further
increase in their proportion of the con-
trolled selling-price of beer meanwhile.
To meet its big and costly programme
of modernisation and rebuilding of hotel
properties, etc., the co. has accumulated
a fine wad of cash (down £51,491 last
term):

than was spent on fixed assets. Stocks
increased by £421,543, book debts by
£300,685, and £632,829 was added the
amount coming to sundry creditors.
In October, 1950, the co.’s pound
shares shot-up overnight from 995. 3d. to
1305., and then dropped just as suddenly
to 102 s. The cause was rumors of a
possible bonus-share issue, which was
promptly denied by the board. Over the
last six months the price has fluctuated
between 102 s. and 80s. At 83s. 6d. the

The store is in the Valley, and the
growth and spread of population have
brought a return of custom to the
Brunswick-street end of the city.
The management has always followed
a keen merchandising policy, and
a lot of money has been spent
recently on extending and improving
shopping facilities and services. Still,
last term’s record profit was won under
exceptional conditions, now passing away
from us ; it cannot therefore be accepted
as a reliable guide to what lies ahead of
the trade.
A swollen export income, especially
for wool, and “full” employment at
spiralling wage-rates sent turnover up
with a rush that obscured an ugly growth
in operating costs and reduction in gross
margins. The co.’s gross earnings in-
creased by £273,094, or 74.6 p.c.:

and 71.5 p.c. of the gross figure as against

allowances for depreciation (up £27,380)
and taxation (up £10,000) reduced the
net gain to £10,135. The £86,370 of
profit was 15.7 p.c. on capital as against
13.8, 13.2, 13.6, 12.7, 12.9 and 11.8 p.c.
back to 1945. Over the last seven years
the div. has been cautiously advanced
from 6 p.c. to 10 p.c., and the prop for
capital has been strengthened from 4s. 2d.
to 14s. Id. per £1 share.
Last term £163,201 was added to the

To help meet the outlay the co. went to
its bankers for an extra £143,286 and to
sundry creditors for a further £38,489.
The improvement in the more-or-less
liquid surplus (£392,631) was £18,208.
Stocks, most vulnerable of the assets,
appear at cost or lower market-value.
Following the close of accounts buyer
resistance has stiffened, bank-credit
facilities have been tightened, the currency
of outward drafts has been reduced from
90 days to 60 days, the shipping position
in respect of overseas goods has eased,
price-control authorities have further cut
gross margins on some lines, increased
sales-tax has bumped up selling-prices,
and heavier income tax and rising wage-
rates have greatly increased pay-roll
totals, transport and all other charges.
Among other things, it all resulted in
retail sales at cut prices of some lines
in order to meet bank obligations and to
adjust stocks to altering trade conditions.
The retail trade is passing through a
difficult, though not serious, period of
adjustment, after which prices are ex-
pected to harden. With the approach of
Christmas spending, though more re-
strained this year than last, some of the
feeling of apprehension is disappearing.
Prices of the co.’s £1 shares, steady
around 425. for many months to end
August last, eased to 38s. in October and
to 355. 6d. last week.

Stannite Ore-bodies
The Sardine Tin Mine, Ewan
(N.Q.), with a production valued
at £200,000 to the end of 1949,
is staging a revival. Reddie
Bros, bought the show (in
liquidation) in 1933, and did
fairly well out of it at times.
In 1937 they established an over-
seas market, and later an Aus-
tralian one, for concentrates
from the so-called refractory sul-
phide ore left in No. 5 North
(210 ft. v.d.) and No. 6 North
(250 ft. v.d.) levels on the then
north-eastern boundary. This
ore proved to be stannite —a
copper-tin sulphide.
The war swept away both
markets. But the overseas one
was explored again in 1947, and
a new, rich stannite ore-body in
workings below No. 4 North
level (173 ft.), across both the
old boundary and the slide which
cut off the Sardine ore-shoots,
provided worth-while parcels.
No. 4 level (connected to the
main tunnel) was extended over
the new ore-body and a connec-
tion made. From the new make
135 tons of stannite ore were
crushed for 39.8 tons concen-
trates, worth £12,000, which
more than repaid the owners for
the delays due to difficulties en-
countered. Some payments are
received for the copper (up to
27 p.c.) and bismuth (under
1 p.c. here but up to 2 p.c. in
the old workings) contents of the
concentrates.
The level has been extended
28ft., still in ore though more
siliceous, and a rise put up 14ft.
near where the ore was first met
shows similar high-grade stuff.
These workings are in a virgin
area.
There are quite likely to be
stannite ore-bodies in some of
the old productive but now-
abandoned tin-mines in North
Queensland, particularly where
the tin ores are accompanied by
copper ores. The Brass Bottle
Mine, still working, is one in-
stance. Stannite ore occurred at
the Oonah Tin Mine (Tas.), and
also at Howell’s Creek (N.S.W.),
in a lode which also carries some
lead-zinc values, now being
tested by Broken Hill South.


Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
About 250 members of the English-
Speaking Union attended the Christmas
luncheon at the Victoria Palace. Sir
Charles Lowe, who was accompanied by
Lady Lowe, was chairman, and introduced
guest-speaker R. G. Menzies. It was a
very solemn P.M. who affirmed that “Aus-
tralia is not walking out on any other
British country. We stand side by side
with the United Kingdom on every
economic and financial problem which
confronts the British family.” There was
prolonged applause when the P.M. used
the words “We in Australia are imperish-
ably British” and further added “If I
were the President of the U.S.A. I would
offer up a daily prayer for a British
Empire that was strong and enduring be-
cause I would know that would mean
everything to the strength and future of
my own country.” Mrs. Menzies wore
a grey silk frock shadow-printed in grey
and yellow ; her small black hat carried
soft white feathers. Lady Dixon con-
trasted her black suit with a caramel-
toned straw cloche. With the Consul-
General for the U.S., Henry E. Stebbins,
who thanked the P.M. for his speech,
was Mrs. Stebbins in smart hunter-green
suit and small black hat.
Quite a festive air invested the head-
quarters mess of the Royal Melbourne
Regiment when the C. 0., Lieut.-Colonel
G. I. Mallock, and officers of the regi-
ment entertained 250 friends at a dinner-
dance. In the centre of the floor was a
large illuminated Christmas-tree, and
looped across the ceiling were trails of
greenery twined about with colored fairy
lights. Lieut.-Colonel Mallock received
the guests with his wife, in short black
crepe cocktail frock, and the president of
the mess, Major Murray Hamilton.
Among the guests was the honorary-
colonel of the regiment, Major-General
Sir Julius Bruche, who was accompanied
by Lady Bruche in a pastel-blue
ensemble. Other guests at the official
table were Lieut.-Colonel H. Wells and
Mrs. Wells, Colonel Charles Armstrong
and Mrs. Armstrong and Colonel and
Mrs. R. R. Gordon.
Mrs. Keith McDowaii danced in
pastel-blue crepes, Alison Hepburn in a
cinnamon-brown-and-green-patterned silk
frock. Mrs. H. W. Butler added to her
grey crepe frock a small black velvet
cap finished with matching ospreys. Mrs.
Pip Piper’s dove-grey jacket-suit was
finely pleated. Mrs. G. Thornley wore
a strapless frock of American-beauty
tulle, Mrs. G. Rowden a deep-green shot
tie-silk which had a draped skirt. Mrs.
E. Campbell’s short faille frock was
striped in green and burgundy. Mrs.
Laurie Downey’s bouffant white organza
was patterned in a black lace design.
Mrs. Don Urquhart chose black crepe,
Mrs. Reg Urquhart a short white floral
silk with an overskirt of white tulle, and
Anne Briggs, an English visitor, a frock
of pastel-pink crepe.
There was only one unhappy note at
the annual meeting of the Y.W.C.A.:
the presentation of the balance-sheet,
which showed a deficit on the year’s work
of £5OOO. Otherwise it was a pleasant
evening, with the patroness. Lady Brooks,
present in a bouffant gown of ice-bluc,
white-flower-printed marquisette. Mrs.
T. C. Rentoul, president of the Y., was
chairman of this 69th annual meeting,
and among the speakers were .Senator Ivy
Wedgwood, Miss M. R. Law and Coral
Rose. Mrs. Karl Kumm, just back from
the world conference of the Y.W.C.A. in
the Middle East, sat with Mrs. Essington
Lewis, the latter wearing a gown of royal-
blue chantilly lace. Mrs. Henry E.
Stebbins was there with her husband, the
U. Consul-General, and also present
were the Consul for China and Mrs. Liu,
she in a beautiful national costume of
turquoise-blue satin heavily embossed in
a gold pattern. Mrs. Olive Thring wore
a black gown and a chartreuse crepe
jacket, and Mrs. Jim Fitzgerald a white
linen dinner-gown,
Kathleen Lascelles lent her Toorak
home, with its garden a fairyland of
colored lights, to Clarissa Starey for a
party which farewelled Commander A.
Stuart-Menteith, R.N., Angela Willoughby
and Edward Wright, who are off to
England. Guests romped through
Scottish reels and fox-trots, and among
the dancers was Jean Brooks, the
Governor’s daughter, wearing a wide-
skirted gown of white linen which had a
deep square collar finished with eyelet
embroidery. The Prime Minister’s
daughter Heather was attractive in ice-
blue taffeta, printed in silver flowers.
Kathleen Lascelles’s slim gown was of
flame-red chiffon. The hostess, in a
white-striped navy plisse strapless gown,
was assisted by her mother, Mrs. A. W.
Starey, who wore black crepe patterned
with tulips. Anne Spraggett wore pastel-
pink, Gillian Pain blue-and-white cotton,
Julia Mary Rouse blue-and-white-checked
cotton, and Margaret Russell pale-lilac
moire faille.
Helen, only daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
I. T. Birtwistle, of Cottesloe, W.A.
(pictured here), is at present a staff nurse
at the Alfred Hospital. She has just
announced her engagement to a young
man whom she has known since school-
days in Perth; Andrew Charles, younger
son of Mr. and Mrs. V. E. Kingsbury, of
Kelanten, Malaya. Andrew has just
passed his final medicine and is returning
shortly to Perth, where he will become a
resident at the Royal Pert& Hospital.
Helen will follow in a few months’ time.
The 1952 autumn and winter Collec-
tion of Ecstasy creations was a notable
achievement. Styles, fabrics and work-
manship were of the highest quality, and
fashion-gleanings during the show were
that the silhouette is truly feminine, skirt
lengths are 13in. to 14in. from the
ground, the two-piece outfit, which com-
bines a topless dress and varied jackets,
is growing in popularity, and sleeves in
both coats and frocks push up to show
bracelets and gloves. Black has first place
among colors. Largo is a deep plum ;
Paris haze is the newest slate shade;
black pepper is the 1952 interpretation
of charcoal-grey; Chile is a rich red for
evening; star ruby a fuchsia for dinner-
gowns ; royal command is a deep
sapphire and bachelor’s button a cherry
red. Outstanding in the collection was a
group of black afternoon-frocks in wool
romaine, worsted romaine, satin romaine
and powderbloom crepe. Features of
these frocks were the use of shawls or
detachable drapes over slim skirts, the
fringe edging shawls or sleeves, the
mandarin-type of collar, the high “turtle”
neck and the turnover “petal” collar,
often embroidered with pearls or beads.
Edinburgh, one of the most attractive
frocks in this range, is an adaptation of
a Jacques Fath model with a Scottish
influence. It featured a detachable
fringed shawl. Held at the right of the
bodice, high at the back with a diagonal
buttoning, it passed over the shoulder
and continued down through the black
patent-leather belt to form a back floating
panel.
Other attractive creations were “Cover
Skirt,” a wide flared overskirt lined with
Chile-red which swung out at the back
of a slim skirt, and “Moonglow,” a cock-
tail frock of silvery-grey ripple bengaline.
Bal Tabarin” is a night-club two-piece
in black faille with a beaten gold-fern
pattern; the long-sleeved, fitted hip-
length jacket covered a plain black
taffeta bodice with a halter neckline.
Evening gowns were lovely and
dramatic. A slim black velvet gown had
a stole of black-and-gold striped faille
threaded between the front peaks of the
“scimitar” bodice and continued down
the back of the bodice to fall into a bustle
with sash-ends. Well-named was “Juliet,”
a silver - embroidered Chantilly - lace
mounted on white tulle over pastel-blue
satin. “Elizabeth,” as its name implies,
was a regal gown of magnolia satin with
a strapless top and tiny bolero massed
with seed-pearl embroidery. Romance
was in every line of “Du Barry,” a
sapphire-blue Chantilly-lace gown em-
broidered with pale gold.
From Sydney
The weather was at its kindliest for
the reception held at Government House
by the Lieutenant-Governor, the Hon.
K. W. Street. Filled with the billowing,
flower-like frocks of the younger girls,
the drawing-room provided a scene of
sophisticated elegance, and through the
wide doors the flowering gardens with
their velvety green shadows were
intensified in color by the golden,
windless evening. The Christmas recep-
tion was also a party to celebrate the
engagement Laurence Street, second
45 e Justice, to Susan Gai
Watt. The young couple helped receive
the guests, most of whom belonged to
their own age-group. The perfect weather
permitted the filmiest frocks and the
wi .hats to be worn. White and
pastel-tinted organzas and organdies
opped with picture-hats were chosen by
most of the young girls, with eye-veils
running the picture-hats a close second,
Dressing was really lovely. The wide-
skirted grey organza apphqued with white
guipure lace worn by Susan Watt had the
insubstantial beauty of a summer cloud,
She wore with it a wide-brimmed black
crinoline straw picture-hat. Yellow-
and-white-checked organza worn with an
embroidered eye-veil was chosen by
Elizabeth Northcott. Jill Pratten’s choice
was also yellow organza with a matching
hat. The same material formed Annette
Macarthur-Onslow’s white-tiered frock.
The most engaging small hat was Pam
Allsop’s: close-fitting and made almost
entirely of pink feathers, she wore it
with a blue frock.
Final round of the Christmas whirl-
wind is on, with last-minute shopping
being crammed in between a spate of
parties. Those lucky ones who have com-
pleted their shopping wear a triumphant
but slightly exhausted look; an air of
harassed bewilderment marks those who
still have incomplete lists to fill, while
those rare souls who listened to the
appeal of shopkeepers to “shop early”
have an aura of smug well-being.

The smiling girl with a koala is Sheila
Hawkins (Mrs. S. M. Bowden), who is
exhibiting illustrations to books for
children in the Walk Gallery at David
Jones’s. Born in Kalgoorlie (W.A.) she
has returned here lately, after nearly 20
years spent in England, bringing her
small daughter Anne-Belinda. Children’s
books, which she has illustrated with dis-
criminate taste and engaging color,
have been published in England, America
and the Continent. Her drawings of
animals are amusing without loss of
the dignity natural to animals. Mural
painting is another field in which she
has succeeded —she was commissioned to
paint the murals in the children’s dining-
room of the liner Manoora. During the
war she went to Scotland to make a series
of sketches for murals depicting the work
of the Australian Forestry Unit —she
felt keenly that their good work should
not go unrecorded pictorially. The
London agent for the Australian War
Museum bought some of the designs for
Canberra, and since her return the same
museum has acquired another couple.
Product of no particular art school, she
says that since she had no fewer than six
uncles all fine natural draftsmen, she
just had to learn to draw.
Four hundred smiling, happy lasses
gathered at the Trocadero for the
V.A.Ds.’ Christmas dinner-party. After-
wards, president Mrs. Persia Porter made
her annual speech, and was rewarded for
her good work with the presentation of
a fitted beauty-case. At eight o’clock no
less than 700 guests joined the party, place
of honor among them going to Captain
Hartly Mac Allister, whose good deeds
make him prime favorite with the aides.
A group of officers from H.M.S. Glory
and a parly of new British settlers were
among those entertained with dancing
and a floor-show put on by the members
and compered by Red Cross lecturer
J. T. Wooten. Bright spot of this show
was the sketch “Buttercup,” a particularly
humorous horse groomed by the Sydney
City Detachment. The party ended
appropriately with the Australian
Christmas carol, “Christmas-bush to His
Adorning,” composed by William James
and sung by the members’ choir. It was
followed by hearty mass singing of tradi-
tional carols.
Despite strong counter - attractions,
public and private, “Brigadoon” opened
at the Royal last Saturday night to a full
house. Dressing was only so-so for a
first-night. The bright little show is as
full of tartans, reels, flings and pipes as a
Christmas-pudding is full of plums. The
mythical village of Brigadoon takes its
name from an old and energetic sort of
dance. On the stage the inhabitants live
up to the name by dancing agreeably
through two acts and 12 scenes. The
dirge by a couple of authentic pipers
stole the show. Plaintive wailing notes
filled the theatre in the most gratifying
way. This Letter would have enjoyed
hearing more of them. Those to whom
pipes are not music were compensated
by nice orchestration and fresh singing
of the musical numbers by Gwen Overton
and Lionel Baker.
With gardens apparently impervious to
drought and water-restrictions, com-
mittee-members of the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra provided beautiful flowers at
the cocktail-party for the orchestra held
at the A.B.C. studio at King’s Cross.
These floral offerings, for which Mrs.
Hope Gibson and her assistants merit
full marks, are always a feature of
entertainments organised by this com-
mittee. Guests, received by the president,
Lady Anderson, and secretary Mrs. Hope
Gibson, represented a good slice of what
is best in Sydney’s musical world. Mr.
and Mrs. Eugene Goossens, the Joseph
Posts, Beatrice Tange, members of the
orchestra and a host of others prominent
in musical circles all sampled the
appropriately-decorated and tasty cake
presented to the orchestra by Lady Lloyd
Jones and toasted the players in the
traditional way.
The re-election of Lord Mayor Aider-
man O’Dea as the head of Sydney’s City
Fathers for a fourth year of office brought
a steady stream of well-wishers to the
Town Hall. Everyone is delighted that
Mrs. O’Dea will be Lady Mayoress
again. Her quiet dignity, kindness and
sincerity have endeared her to the women
of Sydney, who appreciate her tireless
efforts, as well as those of her husband,
in charitable and other public causes. As
one overseas visitor remarked after
sipping tea at the Town Hall, “They are
nice people.”
The King’s School devoted two days
last week to prize-giving ceremonies. On
Tuesday the junior school received
awards from Major-General the Rev.
C. A. Osborne, who showed his nice
understanding of small boys by making
a delightful but not over-long speech.
Lieut.-General Sir Leslie Morshead, the
anticipated guest-of-honor of the senior
school for the following day, was
unexpectedly called to Melbourne. His
place was filled at short notice by the
Archbishop of Sydney, Dr. Mowll. Head-
master H. D. Hake presided, supported
on the platform by members of the
council, representatives of the Old Boys’
Union and members of his staff. In the
happy atmosphere of parents, old boys
and students, Mrs. Hake made a charm-
ing job of distributing the prizes. Visitors
to the school were impressed by the exhi-
bition of student art. Under the intel-
ligent guidance of Jeanne Bellette the
boys had expressed themselves with
colorful vigor and freedom. Return of
the senior boys from their period of
military training at Ingleburn was a
feature of the marching-out ceremony.
They swung in with fine style, led by the
excellent school band. The school looked
its handsome best with a fine display of
hydrangeas in the grounds and .great
masses of gladioli and mixed flowers in
the school library, where Mrs. Hake
served tea to the visitors, who lingered
on into the sunny evening reminiscing
happily.
Among the gathering were those bear-
ing names long in the school records,
such as the Suttors, of Bathurst, with five
generations educated at “King’s,” the
Friends, Blaxlands, Reillys and many
other families whose record of service to
Australia is the measure of the quality
of the school. An old friend of The
Bulletin and one-time contributor,
P. Robertson, is engaged in research
to complete the school records be-
tween February, 1832, and 1896, a
period when no lists of old students were
kept. The job entails a whole lot of
research and correspondence, but gradu-
ally the gaps are being filled.

Rabbits in their countless millions
constitute one of Australia’s most
destructive pests. Good grazing land
can be rapidly turned into barren

I OF GLAZED TERRA-COTTA
PERSONAL ITEMS
Still going strong, Archbishop Duhig,
of Brisbane, the other day notched the
46th anniversary of his consecration as
a bishop. When he was appointed R.C.
Bishop of Rockhampton (Q.) in 1905 it
marked the dividing line between the old
church policy of an imported hierarchy
and the modern one of promoting Aus-
tralians. Australian in all but birth —
born in Limerick, he was brought to
Australia as a toddler —he was both the
youngest bishop and the youngest arch-
bishop ever to be appointed to a diocese
in Australia. Now 80, he’s a Fellow
of the Royal Geographical Society of
Australia, a friend of Cardinal Mindszenty
and an uncompromising critic of Com-
munism. And his ambition is still to
build a cathedral in Brisbane which will
make all other cathedrals in Australia
look like St. Patrick’s first hut.
Norman Lindsay, who was born in
1879 at Creswick, in Victoria, began his
art studies after the period covered by
“The Letters of Rachel Henning,” but
he has found them a fascinating subject
for illustration. Proofs of each instal-
ment have been sent to him at Springwood
in advance of publication, and he has
done his pen-drawings there. And splen-
did examples of his penwork they are.
At rising 73 Norman’s hand is as light
and sure as ever, but a week or so ago
he was working under difficulties created
by the Blue Mountains bushfires. A note
attached to his illustrations from Spring-
wood commented:
With the bushfires round about —we had
one nearly on the premises, but managed
to burn back in time to meet it —it has
been a job concentrating on work. The air
gets so damned hot that the ink won’t run
freely off the pen. I hope next year is
going to show some rationality in both
nature and mankind.
Making his first contributions in 1900,
Norman joined the art staff of The
Bulletin in 1901. His work in last week’s
Christmas issue fittingly marks half a
century’s association with this paper.
Melbourne University’s Union Theatre,
which in the last few years has shown
the most intense activity of any amateur
theatrical concern in Melbourne, lost its
chief inspiration with the death of pro-
ducer Desmond Connor. Appointed to
replace him, Londoner J, J. Sumner has
worked with Laurence Olivier as stage-
manager and producer. Sumner’s wife
started the “Under Thirty” group in Eng-
land and is also an experienced producer.
The new man had six years’ service with
the Merchant Navy in its greatest show.
“Macnell”: The Duke of Edinburgh
being a sociable type, he would natur-
ally (when standing-by, as first-lieutenant,
the commissioning of a destroyer) have
become pally with his fellow-in-strife, the
first-lieutenant of the sister-ship com-
missioning beside his own—first-
lieutenants, at this trying time, being ever-
ready to cry on each other’s care-loaded
shoulders. The Duke’s opposite-number
was a young Xavier College (Melbourne)
man, John Michael Parker, whose father,
Captain C. A. Parker, is now at Navy
Office. The acquaintance begun early in
1944 ripened with both ships, Whelp and
Wessex, serving in the same flotilla in the
Mediterranean, Indian Ocean and round
the Philippines. To the extent of Parker
being offered the post of equerry to the
former first-lieutenant, now Royal Duke.
Parker, who attended during the Canadian
tour, and will travel with their Royal
Highnesses on the coming Australian
visit, joined the Royal Navy as a cadet
in 1938, and was in Hood at war’s be-
ginning, leaving that ship a few weeks
before Bismarck got her. From then on
he was in destroyers, with all the tough
work that implies—Atlantic patrols, on
those lively convoy-runs down the east
English coast, and in at the North Africa,
Sicily and Italy landings. He’s married
to a former Wren, another friend he met
while standing-by another ship, destroyer
Lauderdale.
Selected for the coveted flag-officership
of the Royal yacht on the coming visit,
Vice-Admiral Charles Lambe was a
specialist in torpedoes before he took to
their favorite target, aircraft-carriers.
Lately in command of the Third Carrier
Squadron, not yet 50, he had carrier
Illustrious in the War II Pacific. He’s
been associated with Royalty before —
equerry to both Edward VIII and
George VI.
The Victorian Symphony Orchestra
will have to wait for its permanent con-
ductor ; in the meantime Alceo Galliera
will be temporarily succeeded by Juan
Jose Castro, who conducts in Monte-
video, of Graf Spec memory. He
formerly conducted in Buenos Aires, but
was in the habit of diversifying his
music-making with sundry outspoken
statements about democracy, dictatorships
and such things, which he sent to the local
Press with his name attached ; President
Perdn was not amused. So for the past
three years Castro has been permanent
conductor of the Uruguay National
Orchestra at Monte. He’ll have the job
of stropping the Melbourne orchestra to
a fine edge for six months. Hephzibah
Menuhin, who has played under his
baton, describes him as one of the world’s
finest conductors.
L. G. NORMAN,
the new leader of the Victorian L.C.P.
Henry Arthur Winneke, 0.8. E., senior-
counsel to the Attorney-General, will be
the first Victorian Solicitor-General
without Ministerial status. Son of Judge
H. C, Winneke, 43, and educated at
Scotch and the University of Melbourne,
he was with the R.A.A.F. in War 11. A
noted pleader, he has been Crown Prose-
cutor since 1949.
Coventry renders the attached account
of Alan Augustus West, since last year
g.-m. of the Bank of Adelaide and chair-
man of the Associated Banks of S. Aus-
tralia, both of which positions he took
over from his half-brother, the late Sir
Oscar Isaachsen. Joining the bank in
1916 (Oscar had had 11 years in
by then). West took time off to help

of the Bank of Adelaide.
unbalance Wilhelm’s ledger, and with that
account closed was transferred to Sydney.
Further experience took in Fremantle,
Perth and Brisbane, with, throughout War
11, the managership of the Sydney branch.
To keep abreast of post-war conditions
West was sent off to the U.S., Britain,
Scandinavia and the Continent, and on
return got the assistant general-manager-
ship.
Spiked his last copy, at 57, James R. W.
Taylor once had an assignment which
was a journalist’s notion of Paradise.
Son of a former editor of Brisbane
“Courier,” Jim Taylor joined the “S.M.
Herald” in 1928, after a cadetship on
the “Courier,” a period on Sydney
“Telegraph” and service in France with
the Ist A.I.F. One night in September,
1941, word got to him to ring the
“Herald” —“urgent, very important.” He
rang, and was told to stand-by to leave
for New Zealand. Aboard the 40-year-
old Claymore Taylor found what his
assignment was —he would be the only
newsman covering the salvage of
£2,000,000-odd-worth of gold ingots
which had sunk with the mined Niagara
off the New Zealand coast the year
before. Taylor went down with deep-
sea diver Johnstone, cramped in the
diving-bell, to get his local color right.
His articles were featured throughout the
world, and in 1942 his book. Gold From
the Sea, was on the bookstalls. Author
of another book on salvage, Spoils From
the Sea, Taylor was the “Herald’s”
Saturday Magazine editor at the end.
Ex-Senator James Guthrie wept at the
selling of his famed Corriedale stud flock
at Elcho, near Geelong, the other day
—and with reason. The stud represents
for the one-legged Old Digger a lifetime
of effort which can’t be passed on, as his
only son was accidentally killed in 1935
and he has no grandson. Now on
the threshold of 80, he started as a junior
clerk in Dalgety’s, became the leading
wool expert in Australia and New Zealand
and in the succeeding 40 years made his
stud one of the world’s greatest. Last
year his rams won first, third and two
equal fifths at the Palermo International
Show in Argentina ; in major Australian
shows he has won 130 championships and
1300 first prizes, and got the world-record
price for a stud Corriedale ram —1250
guineas. Using a broken gum-branch for
a hammer, the auctioneer knocked the
stud down for just under £70,000. The
Elcho stud is gone, the breeder retires
with his honors. Before it is too late
the words he wrote on breeding and
sheep-management should be garnered
and compiled for the future.
Medical statesman passes;
Dead at 82, the Viscount Addison of Stalling-
borough, an almost forgotten celebrity of the
War I era who had the rare distinction of
graduating from the top-flight ranks of medicine
to the higher strata of government. No man
ever before had included in his career the
Hunterian professorship at Cambridge, the presi-
dency of the Medical Research Council and the
leadership of the House of Lords and office of
Lord Privy Seal. Like most men of his type
Lord Addison was somewhat sketchy in his
outlook on party allegiances, and he veered
from the Liberal party into Labor after World
War I, during which he had been Asquith’s
Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Educa-
tion and Lloyd George’s first Minister of Muni-
tions and Minister of Reconstruction. He was
the first British Minister of Health (1919-21),
afterwards held some minor portfolios before
1931, and after a period of 15 years in the
wilderness he popped up again at 76 in 1945 a
Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations
in the Attlee Government, charged with the
generally unwanted task of dismembering the
Empire and giving India and Burma and the
rest their “freedom.” Until just on his 80th
birthday he served in the Ministry as Paymaster-
General. He wrote an extraordinary number
of extraordinary works, ranging from a medical
best-seller called On the Topographical
Anatomy of the Pancreas and Adjoining Viscera
to an erudite book in which he collaborated
entitled With the Abyssinians in Somaliland-
He was a scholarly-looking person, bearing him-
self with meditative solemnity but with a quiet
sense of humor.
With five and a half years’ overseas
experience behind him, Adelaide physicist
Dr. K. B. Mather returned the other day
for a staff appointment with C.5.1.R.0.
in Melbourne. Lecturer at Ceylon Uni-
versity for the past 15 months, earlier he
had taken an expedition to the
Himalayas, setting up his equipment for
cosmic-ray research in the highest pass
between India and Tibet, some 19,000 ft.
up. A C.5.1.R.0. fellowship to the U.S.
started his travels.
Into the Silence:
In Adelaide, at 77, Harry George Sargent,
old Territorian, and for many years owner of
Stapleton station, which supplied the Defence
Department with beef during the war-time
occupation of the Territory. Sargent once
waded into a lagoon on his station to salvage
a large bundle of maps and charts from a
wrecked Jap bomber which had crashed there
with all hands after a dogfight with an Aus-
tralian Spitfire, which also crashed. When
dried the find filled two sugarbags; General
MacArthur later commented on its importance
to subsequent operations.
In England, Madame Antoinette Bettini, who
was one of the singers at the State concert
celebrating the opening of the first Common-
wealth Parliament in Melbourne. A prima
donna at the Imperial Opera, St. Petersburg,
she was a contemporary rival of Melba. Her
stage-name was Antonia Dolores.
In Wellington (N.Z.), at 52, Captain F. D.
Johnson, skipper of the troopship Wahine which
grounded recently en route to Korea. A marine
court exonerated him. He had sailed in many
Union and Adelaide Steamship Company ships.
At 84, at Westernport (Vic.), site of Flinders
Naval Depot, Bob Palmer, the oldest fisherman
in action on the bay. Sixty years ago he ran a
bi-weekly mail- and passenger-service to Stony
Point in hjs sailing-boat Mabel, and never
missed a steamer.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
N.S.W. Wheat Crops.
“C.S.”: After six weeks of
wading through the 70 best
wheat crops of N.S.W., growing
in five divisions of the wheat-
belt between North Star and the
Murray River, N.S.W. Agricul-
tural Department and R.A.S.
observers could find nothing of
the alleged gloom and despair
which, according to political
blah-blah in Canberra and Syd-
ney, had settled like a blight
over the industry.
True, acreage is down and the
State yield will be well below
normal, but acreages and yields
rise and fall as the years go by,
averaging themselves out in the
end. In a year like the one
now culminating in the harvest
fields, sundry factors contri-
buted to the reduced acreage,
not the least of them being the
previous season of floods.
What the tourists sought was
the best crop in each of the
northern, central slopes, western,
Riverina and south-western divi-
sions. The growers are the 1951
champions in their divisions,
and each will receive a R.A.S.
trophy. There is, however, more
than that in it. The competi-
tions not only publicise the farm
practices of successful growers,
they point a lesson in maintain-
ing and increasing acre yields,
draw attention to the value of
certain breeds of wheat under
field conditions, compare the
virtues of fallow and rotation
systems, and generally stimulate
local and State interest in the
nation’s first crop.
In the north, where a fairly
dry season followed the wet
1950 and some crops weren’t
sown until June, disease was
singularly absent, which rather
points the judge’s remark that
some Gabo crops took flag-
smut. Late sowing and a dry
October caused a lot of haying-
off.
Ford, the wheat which made
this district, won the prize for
V. B. McGowan, of Linfield,
Tamworth, Charter and Gabo
running second and third for
Ison and Coleman, of Crooble,
and Heath and Sons, of Cur-
lewis, respectively. McGowan’s
crop was on a 30-year-old pad-
dock, grown on a two-year
fallow-wheat rotation, in con-
trast to the short-fallow prac-
tices of the area.
In the west a 54-bushel Gabo
stand by McKillop and Sons,
near Narromine, was well ahead
of O’Connor and Harvey’s
(Dubbo) Charter and J. Ander-
son’s (Trangie) Bencubbin. The
winner was on a paddock which
went under flood a good bit in
1950 and had a fair amount of
silt on it. It had been under
lucerne for six years to 1945,
was resown to lucerne in 1947 ;
fg
"Cripes! The guests'll be ’ere soon, and look what the
moths 've done to our clobber !”
the lucerne was drowned-out by
the floods and the Gabo was
whipped-in after a short fallow.
Seeding-rate was 381 b. an acre,
and lucerne (2|lb.) and Wim-
mera-rye (|lb.) went in with it.
No fertiliser was used. Thus the
flooding had its compensations.
Generally this division had a
good season, its fifth in a row.
On the central slopes a 15-
bag Bencubbin crop grown by
N. J. Scifleet at Binnaway
headed C. Ewin’s Bordan at
Birriwa and Cooley and Sons’
Bordan at Cowra. Like Ander-
son, of Trangie, Scifleet is new
to wheatgrowing, but his cham-
pionship follows three firsts and
three seconds in local contests.
The paddock is 25 years old,
but was out of wheat for 10
years to 1950, when it carried
oats for grazing and was worked
up for this year’s seeding. It
was a mixed season. The
champion got only 7.2 in. while
growing, whereas over 18in. fell
on other parts of the division. A
large number of growers sowed
lucerne, Wimmera-rye or sub.-
colver with their wheat.
As though to show its versa-
tility Ford, which won on the
heavy chocolate soil of the
north, also won in Riverina, this
time grown on crab-holey, grey-
clay country out of Narrandera.
It belonged to E. J. Mills, and
just shaded an Ariah Park crop
of Bencubbin grown by M. Le-
Lievre and a Finley stand of
Gabo grown by S. Malone. The
season, generally, was very good
after a dry spell had held up
sowing, though high winds lately
caused some dropping back.
On the southern slopes, where
a dry autumn held up seeding
but fair rains fell in the growing
period, followed by cold bites
in late spring, a lot of crops
hayed off and suffered cold
damage.
Champion was K. C. J. Davis,
of Newfield, Corowa, with a 48-
bushel stand of Bordan. W. Les
Burkinshaw, of Collingullie, was
runner-up with Bencubbin and
Mer r i n and Collins, of
Bethungra, third with Ford.
Tomato Irrigation.
“Billjim”; The American grid-
soaking system of irrigating
glasshouse tomatoes might be
more readily adopted in Aus-
tralia, The grid consists of
lengths of piping along which, at
intervals corresponding to the
width of plant rows, are attached
short lengths of £in. piping. To
these soaking-tubes are attached
by hose-clips or cord binding.
The tubes are made from
13oz. proofed cotton duck 4in.
wide, with twice-doubled
seam sewn with oiled hemp
thread, making a tube fin, in
diameter. End of tube is closed
with a similar seam.
The grid is fixed to the house
main by an ordinary hose placed
on the glasshouse path, and the
soakers are stretched along the
rows at the base of the plants.
To ensure an even spread of
watering the soaker-tubes should
be laid along alternate sides
of the rows for successive
waterings.
The Dairy Sire.
“A-Jay”: The advisability of
inbreeding with a bull by mating
him with his daughters is a
problem continually before
dairyfarmers who do not have
facilities for keeping two bulls
and who wish to save the ex-
pense of replacing the bull. Most
wish to keep their bull until the
daughters have been herd-tested
to see whether he is lifting
production or not.
There are several answers to
the problem: Firstly, keep all
sound production-bred bulls
until a fair sample of their
daughters has been herd-tested,
even if it is necessary to mate
some of their daughters to them.
Secondly, consign to the
slaughter-house all bulls found
to be reducing production. Most
inbred daughters by these bulls
will be very disappointing.
Thirdly, bulls maintaining or
raising production can be
grouped into two classes, those
unrelated to the mothers of the
daughters and those which are
related. In the first case the
increased production can be
attributed to outcrossing result-
ing in hybrid vigor. These bulls
may be successful if used for
inbreeding, but they should be
used to the fullest extent for
outcrossing. In the second case
increased production is due to
a concentration of superior germ
plasm. These bulls are the really
superior ones, and may be used
successfully for inbreeding as
well as outcrossing ; they are the
bulls from which herd sires
should be selected.
Poultry Feed.
“Mr.”: When bran and pol-
lard are short any one of these
mixtures will keep up the supply
of eggs: Pollard 201 b., ground
wheat 401 b., ground oats 301 b.,
and meatmeal 101 b.; ground
wheat 801 b., dried brewers’
grains 101 b. and meatmeal
101 b.; ground wheat 601 b.,
ground oats 301 b. and meatmeal
101 b.; ground wheat 501 b.,
ground barley 201 b., ground oats
201 b. and meatmeal 101 b.;
ground wheat 601 b., ground
barley 201 b., dried brewers’
grains 101 b. and meatmeal 101 b.
Greenfeed is fed separately at
midday and a scratch feed of
wheat and oats, or wheat, oats
and barley in the afternoon.
Tetanus and Sheep.
“Merino”: In the “N.S.W.
Agricultural Gazette” of March,
1950, the Division of Animal
Industry warned stock-owners of
the danger of tetanus in sheep
following the Mules operation
performed in old and dirty
yards. The division explained
that “tetanus symptoms usually
appear about a week after treat-
ment, when the operation
wound is closed and healing. A
general stiffening of the muscles
occurs, with spasms of the
muscles of mastication. The
animal stands with legs apart,
and when down the sheep lies
on its side with limbs extended
straight and rigid, with head
thrown back. Death usually fol-
lows 24 to 48 hours later.” The
article advocated keeping sheep-
yards and instruments scrupu-
lously clean and treating the soil
with disinfectants.
On 9/11/’5l the senior
veterinary officer of the depart-
ment reported that 50 sheep in a
flock of 1000 died of tetanus
after the Mules operation in the
Coonamble district. “This loss
will emphasise the need for
sensible hygienic precautions in
all such operations,” he added.
A grazier in W.A. states that
many sheepmen, largely for the
above reason, have discarded the
Mules (surgical) operation and
adopted the Manchester (chemi-
cal) method of prevention of
blowfly strike; also because
Manchestered sheep need no
THE WEATHER
By Inigo Jones
Under the Uranian cycle which now seems to be dominant
hot and dry weather is likely to be resumed. Beyond some
odd storms between Christmas and New Year the more
complete relief should not come till nearly the middle of
January, and then no big rains are likely. The better falls
belong to February and are due on the N.S.W. coast from
Sydney northwards.
The southern part of Victoria and Tasmania should get
tome moderate falls; otherwise only light rains are likely
for the present.

Achievements of an Industry, No. 5.
is a proprietary name given to a
range of remarkable new insecticides developed as a result of wartime
discoveries by 1.C.1. research chemists. They are based on benzene
hexachloride (BHC), a compound first prepared by Michael Faraday
as far back as 1825, BHC can exist in four forms —known as the
alpha, beta, gamma and delta “isomers” —each having the same
molecular formula but different properties. The achievement of the
1.C.1. chemists was their discovery that one of these isomers
possessed remarkable insecticidal properties. By isolating and testing
the different isomers, they established in 1943 that BHC’s insecticidal
powers lay almost entirely in its gamma isomer, and that in pure
gamma BHC they had an insecticide which was, in some respects,
the most effective ever discovered.
“Gammexane” insecticides, based on gamma BHC, mark a significant
advance because, though their effect on insects is both deadly and
persistent, they are almost entirely harmless to men and animals.
In farms and factories they have eradicated pests ranging from cattle
ticks and wire worms to cockroaches, bedbugs and house flies. In
Australia they have proved to be the most useful of all insecticidal
weapons against the plague locust and against the wire worm which
attacks sugarcane.
“Gammexane” -preparations are manufactured at the ICIANZ factory
at Yarraville in Victoria.

further treatment and no crutch-
ing or jetting during the sheep’s
life. With Mulesed sheep there
are considerable blood and loose
bits of flesh lying about after
the operation that attract flies
and harbor tetanus germs.
Healing with the Manchester
method is somewhat slower, but
this is an advantage; as after
treatment a hard fibrous scar
tissue wall is formed, so hard,
in fact, that neither fly nor germ
can penetrate it during healing
or during subsequent years.
Before the scab falls off the
edges of the patch are sealed all
round. This hard fibrous tissue
contains no nerve-endings and
resembles the outside of a
horse’s hoof, and is not subject
to cold or infection, as in the
case of the surgical method. It
prevents collection of faeces and
urine in the breech area and
under the tail, the most attrac-
tive parts for fly attack and
infection, especially with ewes.
The wool on the treated area
round the crutch and under the
tail falls out and never grows
again. It represents only ioz.
of stained wool, and its removal
actually facilitates shearing and
classing. Treatment for sheep
cost about jd. L. L. Manchester,
veterinary surgeon, of Charle-
ville (Q.), discovered this bare-
patch-and-tail-tip method in
1935.
Orchard-feeding.
“Hortus”: Fruit-trees must be
given an annual supply of nitro-
gen, and nitrogenous fertilisers
are getting beyond growers’
means. A common scheme is to
plant field-peas between rows
and plough them under. This is
beneficial. A rough estimate of
the amount of nitrogen returned
to the soil by this means is the
equivalent of a dressing of
nearly 7cwt. of sulphate of
ammonia per acre.
Soil-fertility experiments in
N.Z. show that nitrogen con-
tent can be increased 300 per
cent, by cover-cropping with
clover for two years. Growing
sub.-clover as an annual is com-
ing into favor in many districts.
Its growing habits just suit an
orchard’s requirements. What’s
more, it avoids feeding compe-
tition with the trees.
Sub.-clover comes away early
in autumn. Through the winter
and early spring it provides a
really good stand. It hays off
towards early November. This
is advantageous, as November
often starts a critical period for
tree-development.
In some districts permanent
sod-culture is gaining popularity.
Even sheep are used for con-
trolled grazing. Poultry-rearing
is being done by utilising port-
able sheds. The fowls are
allowed to wander amongst trees
and so deposit manure, to the
advantage of root-development.
Hints for the Farm.
“Big Billy”: Successive sow-
ings of peas may be made up to
midsummer, as their harvesting
period is short. Addition of
blood-and-bone, 4oz. per 9ft. of
row, will be beneficial.
Thorough overhead waterings
during dry periods will aid polli-
nation. Protect against birds by
guards of netting or black cotton
crisscrossed.
“Inver”: All machines that
are to remain idle over a period
should be thoroughly cleaned
and, where necessary, lubricated
before storage. Proof with
paint, oil, grease or special rust-
resisting compounds parts liable
to rust. Protectively house all
implements and machinery and
provide dust-proof covers where
necessary.
“M.”: If collar-rot of citrus
appears, scrape away any soil
heaped around the trunk and
the tops of the main roots near
the diseased area. Cut away all
dead tissue and paint with a
paste made of loz. of bluestone
and 2oz. of water-slaked lime in
half a pint of water.
“A-Jay”: Frequent changes of
boars are needed when home-
bred gilts are kept for breeding.
Anticipate boar requirements a
few months before they become
urgent, and place orders with
stud-breeders for younger boars
during autumn and winter. Stud
pig-breeders don’t hoard boars
of serviceable age, and late
orders can be disappointed.

“In an attack on the U.S. for not

said in Parliament: ‘It is better, any-

Interviewed by a reporter
when, after answering 11 ques-
tions correctly in a big radio
quiz, she failed in the 12th and
thereby missed out on a £1500
car, a motor lawnmower and a
washing-machine, Mrs. Martha
Lemmon, after overcoming her
hysteria, said: “I didn’t want all
that stuff, anyway. I know my
husband would have been most
annoyed if he’d had to clean out
all the junk in the garage so as
to put the gift car in. And I’m
certain he wouldn’t have been
the slightest bit interested in the
motor - mower, because he’s
developed such an affection for
the antique cast-iron job he’s
pushing around now—if he
had only to walk behind a
mower he’d get too fat. As for
the washing-machine, I’m so
thankful I didn’t win it. I believe
they don’t wash clothes any-
where near as thoroughly as
those done by hand. There’s
really nothing I love more than
to get up on a Monday morning
and see a large pile of clothes
that have to be rubbed hard to
get the dirt out of —I simply
can’t get at them quickly
enough.”
In an address to the Wazir
branch of the Pornographic
Postcard Sellers’ Union, the
Egyptian Minister for Mob
Demonstrations, Mudgut Pasha,
said all Egyptians would take a
fierce pride in the 50,000 gallant
laborers who had been ordered
by the Government to cease
accepting pay from the hated
British aggressors. These, during
the war, had fled from the invad-
ing German and Italian armies,
leaving the brave Egyptian army
to face Rommel and Graziani
alone—and the whole world
knew how it had fought like
Bus SToa.
“What you bringing yourself for Chrishmas?"
wildcats at Alamein and Tobruk.
None were more proud, he was
sure, than the laborers them-
selves in the Canal zone
who were now joyfully cele-
brating their paylessness in the
traditional Egyptian manner by
overturning and burning buses
and heaving stones through
windows. To go without pay
from the British was a great
privilege. All Egyptians loved
to 101 l in the sun and sand
and let a few hundred flies
settle around their eyes, and the
Zone laborers, now freed from
the yoke of the British pay-
master, would be at liberty to
indulge in Egypt’s great national
pastime.
Actually, the Egyptian
economy would be greatly
strengthened by the Govern-
ment’s action in refusing to
allow the 50,000 laborers to
be employed jn the Canal
zone. It would mean that
there would be that many more
to look on at mob demonstra-
tions, which was now Egypt's
chief industry. Such an added
boost to the business would
greatly redound to the country’s
benefit. The fact that 50,000
more would be out of work
would mean a greater internal
harmony, as the laborers and
their wives, having no monetary
matters to disagree about, would
get on much better.
Before he was led off to the
cells to begin his sentence of 10
years’ hard labor, Bill the
Basher said to the trial judge:
“It’ll nark y’ to know, y’ ole
cow, that you couldn’t have
handed me anything more to me
likin’. There’s nothin’ I enjoy
better than bashin’ into a heap
o’ rocks with a seven-pound
double-faced hammer on a
scorchin’ day. If you’d ha’ let
me orf on a bond I’d have had
to spend me time playin’ swi or
the broads, soakin’ up schooners
o’ pig’s ear in the rubbidy with
the mob, or been dragged by me
fancy tart to the trots or the
greys. Could anythin’ be more
borin’? Calaboose, here I
come!”
On being apprised of the
tidings that members of the
N.S.W. Parliament had just
helped themselves to another
salary-rise of £5OO p.a,, Plan-
tagenet Dudd, ex-M.L.A., re-
marked: “Nothing could give
me greater gratification than to
reflect that my defeat by 24
votes at the last election has
saved me from the burden of
having to work three months a
year to get £1875. Think of the
handicap that extra £5OO p.a.
would have been to me! It
would have placed me, for a
start, in a higher taxation-
bracket. I would have been
expected by my family to get a
lot more things for the home.
It would certainly have meant
that I would have spent some
of it on a couple of new suits,
thus depriving myself of the
pleasure of still going around in
the shabby ones I now wear.
“It would also have meant I
might have been tempted to
invest some of the spare money
I thus would have had in indus-
trials, perhaps finishing up as a
bloated capitalist, which would
be abhorrent to all my political
principles. But above all, I'd
have had extra money in my
pocket to bet on the big fights.
That is why I’m so glad I’m not
now in Parliament getting that
extra five hundred!”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Our Northern Outpost
If the first session of the new Legisla-
tive Council of Papua-N.G. has proved
anything, it is that there must be two
approaches to our problems:
(1) The domestic outlook: The Terri-
tories as a whole must ultimately live on
what they produce ; consequently the idea
of increased taxation must be governed
by what the domestic production can
pay without curtailing incentive.
(2) The Australian people’s idea of the
value of the Territories in regard to the
defence, etc., of Australia and what they
are prepared to pay for it.
Since about 1945 the rates of wages
and general conditions have not been
economically based, but established on
the exploded Eddie Ward theory of what
should be paid. Where the money came
from was nobody’s business until the
source started to dry up; then the
powers-that-be fell back on increased
taxation.
As one who has known the Fuzzies for
many years—-and likes them —my idea
is that Australia must educate them to
look south, both by white settlement
(under safeguards) to give the Fuzzies an
idea of the mainland Australian’s outlook
—as distinct from the official outlook —
and by making them understand that
they are the forerunners of what could
be an island State, probably as part of
the Australian Federation.
Unless something like that is done the
natives may just as well stay in their
primitive condition until the time when
some driving race from Asia takes
eontrol.- —Me Ale (Papua).
Nontaxpayers
There is scarcely a Government-run
business that has any excuse for not pay-
ing its way. While private enterprise is
saddled with company tax that averages
10s. in the £l, public utilities, be they
banks, airlines or what-have-you, are
immune from taxation —many are exempt
from shire and municipal rates.
The taxpayer is called upon to subsidise
their prodigality or, worse, to underwrite
the efforts of socialistic enterprise to put
taxpaying private enterprise out of busi-
ness. N.S.W. railways for years have
been run at a loss along the coast to oust
the shipping companies, a policy that has
resulted in the recent closing-down of
one coastal shipping firm.
In the banking: field the Commonwealth
Bank spends large sums of public money
in competitive service with the taxpaying
trading banks and doesn’t pay taxes.
But it is the co-operatives which really
sit pretty. Under the mantle of the
generous laws protecting them, especially
exemption from company tax, both pro-
ducer and consumer co-operatives have
grown to gargantuan proportions.
By escaping taxation they compete un-
fairly with private businesses. In the
producer field, particularly, their members
and shareholders are wealthy men, and
their turnover has grown to an extent
where the Treasury is yearly deprived of
millions in revenue which must be made
good by the ordinary taxpayer.
In Queensland co-ops. have become all-
powerful. A co-operative flour-milling
organisation there now controls most of
the industry, and under Queensland law
a co-operative may take over any private
factory or enterprise at an independent
valuation, a circumstance that is keeping
much southern and overseas industry out
of that State.
In N.S.W. recently a special bill was
enacted to force Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Area fruit- and vegetable-growers to sell
their produce to the Leeton Co-operative
Cannery at a lesser price than that offered
by taxpaying private canners. The non-
taxpaying co-operative rice-mill in the
same town has had to be disciplined by
the Commonwealth for exporting its rice
quota at the high overseas price to the
detriment of the local market.
Consumer co-operatives are vast enter-

prises. In 1950 the Newcastle and
Suburban Co-op. paid its members a
rebate of Is. 9d. in the £1 from a profit
of £92,409 on which no company tax
was paid. The result has been, in that
area, that the ordinary retailer, who pays
his taxes, just can’t compete.
The principle of co-operation is a good
one and in a democracy it has every
right to flourish. But not at the expense
of the Treasury and the taxpayer, and
with a tax advantage over competing
private business.
In N.S.W. no one quite knows the
extent of the co-operatives’ operations.
Anybody is entitled to peruse the
balance-sheets of public companies at the
office of the Registrar-General, but the
Registrar of Co-operative Societies will
grant no such privilege.
It may be that in their infancy co-
operatives should be granted a tax con-
cession, but once established they should
pay taxes like every other business, in
fairness not only to their competitors but
to the main body of taxpayers. It’s a
wonder Sir Arthur Fadden, in his search
for revenue, has overlooked such a
lucrative field, which in his own State
must easily be the top profitmaker of all
industry.— Dick Turpin (N.S.W.).
Child-endowment
Now that our immigration quota is to
be reduced, child-endowment should he
made to serve the purpose for which it
was designed. When first introduced in
1941 by the Menzies Government, child-
endowment was intended mainly to
encourage bigger families; but the
machinations of party politicians have
reduced it to a vote-catching bribe.
Capitalising on this potentiality, the
present Federal Government undermined
the birthrate incentive by endowing the
first child, and, not to be outdone, in
election bargaining, the Opposition
sought, unsuccessfully, to gain power by
an extravagant offer of 10s. for the first
child, thereby departing from a hitherto
volubly-expressed belief that this would
defeat the whole purpose of child-endow-
ment.
Acceptable as these irresponsible hand-
outs may be to many, they in no way
encourage bigger families. If payments
were increased to 15s. for the third
child and £1 for the fourth and subse-
quent children there would be some
reasonable hope of bigger families in
the future.
It is too late to expect vote-conscious
politicians to revoke first-child endow-
ment, but those with any sense of
national responsibility should make it
clear that they will not tolerate further
attempts to make this important scheme
the toy of party politicians who are more
interested in buying power than ensuring
Australia’s future strength and pros-
perity.—W. M. H. (S.A.).
On Rail Gauges
The one essential requirement of any
gadget to overcome breaks of gauge is
that it must be confined to the rolling-
stock ; the track remaining unaltered.
That’s where the proposal by “R. Tillery”
(B. 7/11 /’5l) would fall down, even be-
tween standard and narrow gauge; it
would obviously be impossible between
standard and broad gauges. Other com-
plications which have to be dealt with
are the mixture of four-wheel and bogie
stock in use, and the fact, often over-
looked, that it’s not only the spacing of
the rails but all dimensions and clear-
ances, weight per axle and per foot run,
even the shape of the wheel and the type
of brake, which are non-standard.
More important still, except on a
small and local scale, most of the pro-
posed palliatives would cost more than
a complete cure.
The silly part is that had we grasped
the nettle in 1945, when rolling-stock and
other equipment was at its lowest ebb,
and ordered all new stuff for standard
gauge, with a consequent saving through
mass-production, and had we extended
the area covered by the one gauge into
Victoria and S.A. line by line, at the
same time altering their, rolling-stock, a
great part of the problem would have
been dealt with before this, and we’d
have little more than the narrow gauge
at each end.
Objections? They’re obvious. The
enormous vested interest which all other
forms of transport, including Federal
airlines, have in the retention of railway
chaos, and lack of Federal Government
interest in, or control of, State railways.
—Transporticus (Singapore).
Communism
Sages with wisdom’s garlands wreathed,
crowned kings, mitred priests and
warriors with their bright swords
sheathed all now agree that hunger is
the predominant cause of Communism ;
that Mao mustered the millions of China
to the Red Flag with bread alone; the
bread, of course, coming from Moscow.
Nomadic divines and others, mainly
hailing from countries far more riddled
with Red ants and a far lower ration
than ours, have recently warned us we
must abolish poverty and clear up the
slums, whence Communism stems.
Good advice, but not convincing in a
country which overeats, has far more
work than men to do it, a living standard
that old-time princes would have envied,
is prevented by law from toiling more
than 40 hours a week and spends a small
fortune per head on liquor and sport.
No, Communism in Australia isn’t based
on poverty; it’s based on a lust for
power. — Shadow-chaser (Vic.).
Better Farming
“W.M.H." (B. 28/11 / 51) strikes a
timely note in calling for more attention
to the maintenance of soil-fertility.
Better farming, in the sense of
preserving soil-fertility and accepting
responsibility for maintaining and im-
proving the soil of which they are the
temporary custodians, should be ex-
pected of Australian farmers. How is
this to be achieved?
The answer of the bureaucrat, no
doubt, would be to draw up regulations
controlling the use of land for agricul-
tural purposes, prescribing for the proper
use of waste and composts and so on, and
laying down all manner of penalties for
those who failed to farm their land
according to Government decree. The
drawbacks of that are obvious.
The practical way is by education.
Australia devotes far too little of its
national income to the education of those
engaged in, dr likely to be engaged in,
agriculture. We need to spend far more
than we do upon teaching the principles
of scientific farming in the country
schools, where most of our future
farmers are now learning many things
which will never be of much use to them,
and upon extending the services of
trained scientists to those now engaged
in farming. Within a generation,
through increased expenditure upon the
teaching of agricultural methods and
research, we would be far along the road
to better farming and achievement of a
balanced, permanently productive use of
our soil. —D. J. G. (Vic,).

THE KING'S LOSS WAS
AUSTRALIA'S GAIN
John Macarthur Cashed In On
Auction Of Royal Sheep Stud
At 2 o’clock one rainy afternoon in August , 1804, Mr. Farnham, an
auctioneer from the English town of Richmond , climbed onto his stand at the
Sheep Stud of King George the Third 9 and opened bidding for His Majesty’s
entire flock of Merino Sheep .
A MONO the fifty odd gentlemen pre-
sent at the auction was a Captain
John Macarthur, in England on a trip
from the newly established Penal Colony
of Botany Bay.
Lot No. 1, “a ram labouring under a
temporary privation of sight”, was
knocked down to Captain Macarthur for
£6/15/-. This ram was stated to have
produced 3 lbs. 4 ozs. of wool at the last
shearing.
SHEEP STATISTICS-
-1860 TO 1950
The newspaper, “Morning Chronicle”,
which reported the sale described the
sheep as being “very far from hand-
some in shape, and too generally thin
and poor”. Nevertheless the eight sheep
Macarthur came away with became part
of the nucleus of Australia’s greatest in-
dustry.
Macarthur started off with sheep
yielding an average clip of not more than
a couple of pounds. By 1860, when the
first reliable statistics were compiled,
the average fleece weighed 2.9 lbs.
Although the advancement to this
stage had not been very rapid firm foun-
dations were laid. Ten years later the
average was up to 4.25 lbs.
SHEARING MACHINE
The actual shearing at this time was
carried out by hand. However, some far-
sighted men, seeing the weight of fleeces
rise realised that, sooner or later, wool
would become too heavy for easy hand-
shearing.
Basing their ideas on the newly in-
vented mechanical horse-clippers several
men attempted to design shearing
machines. They were not a great
success.
Blade shearers managed to get
through their hundred odd sheep a day,
but faulty transmission and other design
troubles held machines up.
As fleeces grew heavier, the hand
shearers’ tallies began to slip, and the
demand for a satisfactory machine be-
came greater. So, the inventors kept on
trying.
It took quite a few years to iron out
every problem, but finally machines be-
gan to get the upper hand.
By 1910 machine shearing was com-
monplace. By 1920 hand-shearers had
almost disappeared, and machines were
in to stay.
However, the designers could not rest
on their laurels. They were forced to
keep on improving the machines to
match the grazier’s progress.
The average fleece now weighed 7.75
lbs. and early model gear was finding
the going tough.
Moffat-Virtue Ltd., who had been in
the shearing gear business since 1890,
found it necessary to produce no less
than four models between 1900 and 1920
to keep up with the improvement in
sheep.
By 1930 it became obvious to Moffat-
Virtue engineers that a new approach

was necessary, if manufacturers were
going to continue to produce efficient
gear. -j::
After extensive experiments and field
trials they introduced the first ball-bear-
ing shearing machine. This machine
lowered power requirements, and re-
duced transmission losses through oil-
slip on the friction drive.
It was also fitted with the revolution-
ary, independently suspended, “Full-
floating Transmission”.
“Full-floating Transmission” elimin-
ates any drag on the cone-pulley from
the downtube. No matter how hard the
shearer pulls on the downtube the speed
of the cutter never varies.
Sheep are not bruised by the pluck-
ing action of the cutter . . . wool growth
is unhampered by damaged wool follicles

This “Full-floating Transmission” is
still a feature exclusive to Moffat-Virtue
Gear.
