Four-Space Fantasy
Assume that a chemist has reason to sus-
pect the presence of some unknown ele-
ment in something he has to analyse. He
sets to work and tries all kinds of known
agents which react in a certain way under
certain known conditions. He gradually
eliminates them one by one, and finally is
quite sure that a substance is still left
about which neither he nor anyone else
knows anything. The chemist cannot
define this substance nor give it a name,
but is sure it exists because it has made
its presence manifest in refusing to react
to any known test. It now becomes neces-
sary to formulate some new hypothesis
which, will supply new conditions to meet
such a contingency; and, after much grop-
ing in the dark and constant faith in his
theory, the chemist succeeds in creating
synthetically such conditions as enable him
to isolate the hitherto unknown element.
So with the nebulous conception of the
idea of the Fourth Dimension.
One must fii’st of all try to realise the
limitations of the five, senses. How many
are there in our little world who would
dare to say, even assuming that they have
given the matter serious thought, that they
comprehend the vastness of inter-stellar
space or the eternity of time? Is it pos-
sible for anyone of us to imagine what our
outlook would be if our sense of sight were
suddenly increased far beyond telescopic
and microscopic vision?
Our present limited outlook might be
compared to a camera in a dark room full
of all kinds of objects. If one or more of
those objects is illuminated, the image will
be recorded on the film exposed by the
camera’s open shutter. The other objects
will remain unseen and leave no impres-
sion; but it does not follow that they do
not exist.
Let us assume that our consciousness is
limited by the scope of our five senses and
that it can only, operate in a world of three
dimensions. There is then our sub-con-
sciousness, or the state of consciousness
that undoubtedly exists but of which we
cannot exactly say we are conscious—our
capacity for “knowing” by instinct; the
vehicle that carries hereditary tendencies,
the knowledge that supervises the structure
of the body, the almost automatic memory
of our muscles, reflexes, etc.; in other
words, a consciousness that exists, one might
saj*, apart from our material bodies and
appears rather to be a force common to all
living and perhaps even inorganic things
than pertaining to the individual.
Imagine that this sub-consciousness is
more or less in a state of suspension or
repression in direct proportion to the con-
dition of activity of the five senses, func-
tioning by expression or impression, as the
case may be; in other words, the more
conscious we are of consciousness, the more
unconscious we are of the intangible sub-
consciousness that is more or less liberated
in sleep and perhaps entirely so in death.
A babe just born has no knowledge, no
experience of anything; but its sub-con-
sciousness has surprising capabilities. No
sooner does the cold air impinge on the
skin than all mechanical arrangements in
the body commence to function; and the
child’s actions, when the question of
nourishment arises, leave no doubt what-
ever as to its very definite sub-conscious
knowledge on certain important matffers.
In the dream state of sleep, about which
so much has been written and so little is
known, is it not possible to continue on the
lines already hinted at, and conceive the
possibility of our sub-conscious ego becom-
ing liberated and expanding into a space
of more than three dimensions, where time
and space as known to us by our senses
cease to be—where the past and present
and future become one; where the speed
of movement cannot be measured; where
i’nstantaneifSV becomes eternity?
Our mental condition on awakening
almost suggests this. The most vivid and
definite impressions of unbounded motion
and infinite variety of experience have un-
doubtedly been recorded somewhere by our
sub-consciousness; but as the inhibition
of our waking senses is imposed we fail
hopelessly when we endeavor to translate
into words some idea of what, a few seconds
ago, was as clear as light.
We cannot consciously remember any-
thing of which we have had no experience
through the medium of one or more of our
five senses, but it does not follow that no-
thing outside of what we can remember
has ever happened to us.
The fact, however, of there being any
speculation or thought on the matter at all
is the first step towards an enlargement of
the sense channels. It may even be said
that certain great minds such as those of'
Newton and Einstein have already com-
menced the work of enlargement.
The thought or idea of anything must
precede the thing itself. An aeronlane or
table could not exist until the idea has
been conceived. Everything that than has
made might be called a thought form. The
question then arises, is man himself a
thought-form that has been created by
some higher intelligence? If one may
accept the fact that man has intelligence in
any degree, it is equally logical to assume
that all intelligence is not monopolised by
man. The fact, if such, of there being
degrees of intelligence implies that man
cannot be the highest intelligence. And if
there be a higher intelligence it would
appear impossible for us to recognise it
as such consciously, since we have not had
actual experience of it; but it follows on
the same lines as before that there is no
reason why we should not be aware of it
sub-consciously. This, in fact, appears to
be the case, and may explain the instinct
for some form of religion that has made
itself apparent in most peoples.
At this point speculation takes on such
a wide range and opens up so many differ-
ent lines of thought that one would hesi-
tate to deny even the possibility of other
forms of intelligence being embodied in
some kind of energised matter which can-
not possibly make itself manifest to us
through any of our senses, but yet could
exist apart in the form of influences.
One might just as well deny the fact that
there was any sound in a room because
it was inaudible and all the time strong
vibrations above and below audio-frequency
may be going on, as to deny the possi-
bility of there being other beings besides
ourselves.
The conditions of comparative comfort
and safety under which living is conducted
these days is due largely to the rapid strides
science has made during the last half-
century, and it is open to question if the
very comforts and facilities brought about
by science may not tend gradually to re-
lieve our natural protective equipment of
some of its responsibility, • and as this
natural responsibility decreases so does our
dependence, on science increase.
These ideas may seem fantastic in the
extreme, but we liVe in an age where any-
thing is possible, and it may be as well to
prepare our minds in some measure for
the surprises that science may have in
store for us.
R. G. LANGTREE.
Elmer Gantry, Go-getter
Sinclair Lewis is among the dozen leaders
in American literature to-day. Not other-
wise could he have successfully “got awtfy
with” Elmer Gantry and the smashing
blows of it. For it is no easy task to pillory
things held to be sacred. Most men and
women are restive under the burlesquing
of them. Not only the trafficking in evan-
gelicalism but virtually all related Anglo-
American creeds and cults shiver under
Lewis’s merciless sledge-hammer. A chapter
on Will Power is full of savage ridicule.
We are familiar with the alluring” ads.:
“What brought millions to Rockefeller?
Will power. It’s within you. Learn to
develop it. Consult,” etc., etc. Gantry knVw
how to be all things to all men, whether
as Baptist, roving evangelist, occultist, or
Methodist.
The book is an assault on the cant and
conventions of the commercialised church,
is an achievement in revelation and deline-
ation, is a novel of immense ability, but
withal is for its period only and not for
time. One feels that its motivity and mes-
sage are explained by its dedication to
11. L. Mencken. Traces of that slinger-off
are noticeable in the incidentally-sardonic
sarcasms on Rotary, Chautauqua, Report-
ers, Fundamentalists and Ku Klux Klan.
The biographical story in its philosophy
seems to say that the whole of the institu-
tionalised and organised struggle for exis-
tence is bunk and bluff, a “getting it
across,” a “putting it over.” One gathers
of the puppets called people that it is
Fear that alone moves them. The book is
a thundering sneer. It is as ruthless in hold-
ing the mirror up to the manners and mean-
nesses of De'nominationalism as were “Mar-
tin Ahrowsmith” with Medicine and “Bab-
bitt” with Business... Lewis takes infinite
care in mastering the practice, procedure
and purpose, the setting and the atmo-
sphere, of the life he makes the subjects
of his shattering studies. His exactitude
is phenomenal, his portraits Mephistophe-
lean.
“Elmer Gantry” is basically a treatment of
the economic foundations of religious
society. But, although chiefly occupied with
the technique of soul-saving, the novel to
me suggested that its tribks of trade are the
stock-in-trade of all movements dependent
upon making converts and securing support.
One could see Elmer as politician, social-
ist, suffragette, agitator, a leader in any-
thing or everything. He is a type. Here
nothing blows either hot or cold unless the
wind is raised. But beware! In enjoying
this particular propaganda under the iash,
don’t forget your own! All the world’s a
stage; the actor’s art belongs everywhere.
There is ■'pathos in the picture of the
parson’s multifarious jobs (and, in its minis-
tering aspeSts nowadays, the atheist-preach-
er’s jobs too), and deeper pathos in the
tiring, torturing wait for the promotion
which is so frequently a will-o’-the-wisp.
In such tragic summaries Lewis’s realism
bails up one as if before a high way ma'n’s
pistol. The references to oratory and its
sanctified phrases; the wireptillers’ discus-
sions on methods that count best; lavish
detail on the workings of the game—these
things are well done, and overdone. Long
as the novel is the swing of it carries one
onward after one is sick to death of Gantry

mounting ever upwards. Virtue is never
rewarded in this book. It is down-and-out
from first to last. Vice is triumphant every
dav in every way. It is rather tern lying.
1 fancy Dr. Charles McLaurin, of Dost
Mortem’’ fame, would have placed the Rev-
Elmer among his nymphomaniacs. ihe
preacher can conquer tobacco and drink, but
not his polygamous impulses and gratifica-
tions. Not even his towering ambition
could stop him taking the risks of adul-
terous discovery. His affairs with women
are not too sparingly described. They
dot the story in the right places to speed
up the flagging urge of the reader.
Gantry is a compound of hypocrisy,
deceit, early influences, Babbitty babblings,
love of power that at its flood made him
drunken, lust of femininity, yet never other
than a true believer. Liar as he is—and
thinks he isn’t —he, though never remorse-
ful, is yet sometimes conscious of sin, and
therefore the stronger rationaliser of his
justification by his deeds of atonement. He
has to hoodwink himself somehow. You
can envisage him on Judgment Day reck-
oning that his Maker simply must pardon
his shortcomings for the good he did. He is
so sure of himself that but rarely does
he make excuses for slips in conduct. More
perplexing is the picturesque and powerful
Sharon Falconer, a travelling prophetess in
command of a train of expert devil-wrest-
lers. She is unquestionably a well of piety
undefiled, but in the worldly sense is an
impostor and a fraud. That sexually she
falls for Gantry is but part of the Machia-
vellian plot. Quite bizarre is Sinclair’s
dragging-in for her devotions and cravings
certain mystic rites and ritual in the man-
ner of D. H. Lawrence’s Quetzalcoatl-wor-
sliip. This ceremonial symbolism does not
fit in with the rest of the M umbo-Jumbo.
It jars because it mars artistically a tale
consummately a clever and critical comedy
of distinction.
R. S. ROSS.
The Poems of E. M. England
Readers of The Bulletin will welcome
E. M. England’s first volume of verse
(The Happy Monarch and Other Verse;
the Carter-Watson Co., Brisbane), for she
is one of the most delightful of Australia’s
many women singers. Her courtship of
the Muse is not done in neglige. Upon a
dairy-farm at Boonah, in Queensland, she
bears a heavy share of an abundance of
work, and when she wrote to a friend, “just
a line between putting the babies to sleep
and feeding five horses,” she was perhaps
being strictly literal. But the land has
given her something in return for her devo-
tion, and in the best of her poems one
finds a glowing vitality and a rare sym-
pathy with the humble experiences of
rural life.
Like a true lyric poet, E. M. England
responds warmly to the varying moods of
Nature, and the changing seasons win from
her the colorful songs of an acutely-
observant devotee. This gift of observa-
tion and the ability to paint an impressive
picture with economy of words are not,
however, emphasised so much in such
poems as “December in Queensland” and
“Winter Morning” as in “The Teamster’s
Wife,” where the living essentials stand out
very sharply, or as in “The Old Plough,”
where she tells of a tall clod-hopping boy
and of how
He knew and loved those stars of Spring,
The flowerets sprung from out the clod ;
Pied birds that swooped on the new-turned sod,
Clouds on the hill-top billowing;
The silhouette on silver wrought
Of the blasted gum against the sky,
Where late owls with bewildered eye
Gazed on a strange world, sunshine-fraught.
There is no superficial emotion in the
verse of this young Queenslander. Always
she gives the impression that she feels
deeply. Witness the wonderfully restrained
tenderness of “Contentment,” a little poem
in which the alternate short line produces a
halting but pleasing effect:—^
A shaded light, a curtained room,
A deep armchair;
One who steals from the golden gloom
To nestle there;
Together, lost within a maze
Of fairy-lore,
We dip into the ancient days
Of Troubadour.
But by-and-bye, the little head
Droops drowsily,
And eyes that followed where I read
No more can see,
For gold-fringed curtains white as snow
Have dropped upon
The brave, blue candid glance, and so
The tale is done !....
In the rose-glow I sit with dreams,
A long, long space;
At eventide my own home seems
A wondrous place!
A happiness beyond all speech
Bedews my eyes,
For on my hearth, within my reach,
Is Paradise!
Much of E. M. England’s work is intensely
personal. The reader feels that he is shar-
ing the inmost thoughts and that he is a
conspirator in the rebellion against Cir-
cumstance that takes the singer on a wild
flight with the moon across a windy world.
But the fancy of E. M. England is not
always that which springs from a “wild
unrest.” In “Castles” it bears the un-
mistakable sign of a lonely resignation:—
Wistful, alone, forgotten, I am waiting
With brown eyes to the green-gold afternoon,
For what? —since each successive day will only
Wear a like silence, a like sadness, for its shoon!
And still, poor fool! I smile, I dream of lovers,
A king, a clown —aye, any, be he true!
And thiiTking on them, I too walk through twilights,
Stardusted ; nights of moonlight; evenings blue !
Still tlic stout bastions of ivied castles
Gleam tawnily through mild and tinted air;
And from the highest window, o’er her acres
There looks a woman with my eyes and hair!
The defects in expression that are notice-
able here and there in this first volume of
verse will be remedied by an extension of
vocabulary. The moons are too often
“red,” and one -wearies a little of
for the almost equally poetical “shoes,
even while allowing that it has a wider
rhyming use. But in her best lines E. M.
England reveals a happy power to match
thought, with phrase, and that, combined
with her sense of rhythm, gives to not a
few of her poems the irresistible charm oi
perfect balance.
The voice of E. M. England may not
be notably new in Australian poetry, but it
is nevertheless one of singular lyric strength
and warmth.
COLIN BINGHAM.
Seasons and Conventions
Were Elsie Cole (R.P. 1/9/’27) to visit
this cornei’ of the world, she would find a
winter with “barren bush and shrub and
leafless tree,” such as she quotes, but does
not know. Of course, all the trees do not
shed their leaves, but so many do that
the bush is very bare and desolate-looking
in our winter season.
Now, September, the trees are just un-
packing their trunks; they blaze out in a
sudden flame of orange, ot crimson, of
brilliant emerald greens. The kapok-trees
are in flower, here a wonderful gold, there
an equally brilliant crimson. The milk-
woods are beginning to put out their buds;
the poincianas, for months as bare and
desolate as ever trees can look,. uncurl
fronds of palest yellow-green (their time
for flowering is not yet, but leaf-buds are
on show); and the birds are coming back
again.
We have only two seasons here: the wet,
when everything is rushing into growth,
when the world is a riot of scent and of
color and of development; end the dry,
when the leaves drop from the trees, when
growth is slow, when flowers are few, when
all things take life easily.
The wattles come into flower in July,
as a rule. They are the first to blossom;
but after them come others with a rush, so
that for awhile our bush is a glory of
color —crimson and lemon-yellow; olive and
purple and emerald-green; blush-pink and
orange; snowy-white and turquoise; all
melting, in the distance, to a soft, misty
blue.
In March, in the Territory, growth is at
its fullest, rampant everywhere; creeks are
overflowing, the ground is sodden under-
foot; we are near the end of the Wet. Some
rains fall in April, but May sees the finish
of the season; things are drying up again,
and one may see a bush-fire across the
ranges. By July the Dry has set in (mark,
we never say “the wet season,” “the dry
season”; we speak only of the Wet and the
Dry).
So. by July, the Dry has set in; only the
tassels of the wattle show that the earth is
beginning to rouse herself once more. Sep-
tember, though no rain has yet fallen as a
rule, sees the young leaves out in the trees,
and the flower-buds swelling on the poinci-
ana and the frangipanni. October brings
the first rains. The young leaves shoot out
suddenly, the grass grows like a magic car-
pet. the whole land is alert and alive as no
land in the temperate climes may be. De-
cember, January, February—still the rains
fall, still the vegetation grows; grass higher
than a man on horseback, 10 and 15 feet
high, and, occasionally, more than the
double of that! The jungle is now a riot
of scent and color. In March growth is at
its fullest; and the cycle re-commences.
August is our “month of waiting”—wait-
ing for the earth to awaken once more from
her winter sleep; not the sleep of frost and
snow such as colder countries know, but
the rest through the Dry, when Nature lies
gathering strength for her orgy in the Wet.
So up here we have “a sudden Spring,
revivifying the dead earth.” We have
“barren bush and shrub and leafless tree.”
If any Australian poets desire to see the
awakening of Nature from her sleep, let
them come here for awhile, and they may
have their hearts’ desire.
DARWIN.
J. S. LITCHFIELD.
A Satchel of Books
Fulfilling, by George Stevenson (John
Lane). The fact that the hero is undis-
tinguished by high virtues or low vices gives
him a certain distinction in the world of
fiction. His story is quite well written, too.
Rose Growing Made Easy, by ,T. G. Lock-
ley (Cornstalk Publishing Co.). The author,
who is familiar to all Sydney gardeners as
“Redgum,” writes of the queen of flowers
with the enthusiasm of the cultivator and the
rapture of the poet. But with all his
enthusiasms he is a very practical guide.
The Royal Tour, by Taylor Darbyshire
(Edward Arnold). The author represented
one of the Australian newspaper syndicates
on the tour of the Duke and Duchess of
York, and in a foreword the Duke expresses
the hope that the book may induce others
to go out and see things for themselves.
Firecrackers, by Carl Van Vechten
(Knopf: Robertson and Mullens). “Another
of Carl Van Vechten’s unimportant light
novels, disfigured by all of this author’s cus-
tomary annoying mannerisms.” This isn’t
the criticism of an outspoken review, but the
comment of the publisher, printed on the
jacket. And, curiously enough, the estimate
is quite correct. The Americans have some
queer notions about publicity.
Hakluyt’s Voyages (Dent). The third
volume of this well-produced work covers
navigations in the sixteenth century, and
has much quaint and interesting matter con-
eerning British relations with the Great
Turk. Volume IV has a special interest in
that it contains narratives of the voyages of
Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Francis Drake
-—the contents are full of human touches and
the vivid color of first impressions.
Can You Answer This? and Children, Can
You Answer This? by G. A. Birmingham
(Fisher Unwin). Do You Know? by
S. P. B. Mais (Brentano’s). Can You
Answer This One? by A. C. Stevenson Ash-
more (Werner Laurie). Like Ford cars and
cross-word puzzles this invention comes from
America. Its originality consists in turn-
ing an ancient form of torture into a modern
plaything. What the examinee suffers in the
hall of inquisition is converted into an alleged
‘•pastime” described as "most amusing and,
once begun, irresistible.”
The Kingdom of the Run, by A. M.
Stephen (Dent). This romance carries us
back to a day in December, 1577, when Sir
Francis Drake, having refitted his little
squadron, was on the eve of leaving Ply-
mouth Sound. The author catches the spirit
and the atmosphere of those days of high
adventure when the world was wide and
much of it lay still uncharted. The hero
sailed under the great captain in the Golden
Hind as a gentleman adventurer, and the
story tells of what happened to him among
the Indian tribes, also of a beautiful princess,
and of jewels, magic, totems and things
that kindle.anew the lire of youthful imagi-
nation.
Opposite Things, by M. Casta Sturge
(Burleigh Press). An attempt to apply
Hegel’s doctrine of the reconciliation of
opposites to affairs in ordinary life. As
Miss Sturge points out, Hegel’s system of
philosophy is extremely profound and very
difficult even for specialists to understand.
She suggests that we ought in a great
degree to read philosophers as poets trying
to convey to us inexpressible truths, for the
great function of poetry is to try to express
what is wholly above our comprehension, and
if does this by assertion, not by argument —a
truth for which The Bulletin can vouch,
out of its experience. This groping after the
inner meaning of Hegel is Avell covered by
incus a non lucendo.
Intercourse and Education. The annual
report of the Director of the Division of
Intercourse and Education under the Car-
negie Endowment for International Peace.
During the year 1926 50 professors of Inter-
national Law and Relations associated with
American universities visited Europe as
guests of this endowment in order to make
“what may be called a clinical study of
international organisation and international
association.” The principal centres visited
were Paris, the Hague and Geneva. In
future years representatives of the press,
business men and teachers may also be
invited to join similar parties to visit Europe
for like purposes. Interesting, if for no
other reason than as showing the breadth
of the American conception of education.
Mackenzie and His Yoyageurs, by Arthur
P. Woollacott (Dent). When Alexander
Mackenzie arrived in Montreal in 1779 an
immense area of Canada was still unexplored.
The Hudson Bav Co. and other traders in
furs were more intent upon business than the
development of the country, and beyond the
establishment of forts in the outlying portions
of the territory gave no attention to purely
explorative work. The unexplored North and
West stretched out alluring expanses to the
adventurous spirit of Mackenzie, and in lio.
he and his fellow-voyageurs set out in tour
canoes to mark out a route through the
innumerable lakes and rivers of the North-
West that would, it was hoped, open our
eventually in the Pacific. The author bases
his well-compiled story of this canoe voyage
to the Arctic and Pacific on Mackenzie’s own
narrative published in 1801 and now well
worthy of revival.
The (treat Delusion, by “Neon” (Benn).
“Cool and dispassionate consideration of the
facts will,” in “Neon’s” opinion, “show that
‘air power’ is illusory and 'air supremacy a
will-o’-the-wisp. The development of aircraft
for war purposes is a sheer waste of men and
money, and moreover constitutes a grave
danger, since expenditure and dependence
upon unreliable and futile weapons is a sure
road to defeat.” The author then sets out to
show that airships can never be safe or prac-
ticable as commercial long-distance vessels
and are useless in war; that aeroplanes can
never be made to pay in peace as passenger
or freight carriers, and that in war they
have proved themselves to be unreliable,
ineffective and unprofitable. The book is
well reasoned and brings a formidable body
of evidence to its support.
Harmony Between Labor and Capital, by
Oscar Newfang (Putnam’s). In this “essay
on the welfare of nations” the author
attempts to lay bare the basic causes of the
strife between labor and capital and to pre-
sent “a comprehensive and final solution ot
the problem of establishing harmony between
the warring factions.” Apparently Mr. New-
fang is the saviour whom the world ha 3
been seeking for many weary and perplexed
years. His solution of all our industrial
troubles is apologised for on the ground of
its complexity—“if this were not so the
solution would have been found and applied
long ago.” This, in brief, is the formula:
The total earnings of labor to be all that a
business earns, less a reasonable rent, or
dividend, for the capital employed. “The
workers would get exactly what they earned ;
that is, all that they could make the business
produce, less the hire of the capital em-
ployed." From which it will be concluded
that Mr. Newfang doesn’t really bring us
much nearer to the goal.

“H.W.8.” (S’Africa): It is seldom one can
impeach the accuracy of a statement in the
first pages of The Bulletin, but. with re-
ference to the article by Randolph Bedford
(B. 11/8/’27) on “Australian Worthies” I
mistrust the implication that “Hendrick
Hudson” was a Dutchman. I thought that
records in his native county—Yorkshire-
had fully established that he was an English-
man, sailing in the Dutch East India Com-
pany’s service, but English for all that. Has
Mr. Bedford any records of Hudson’s life
bearing out his implication?

Vaucluse House.
Where Wentworth lived the birds still sing,
Still lift their morning melodies
Where once lie trod green dewy paths,
A thinker among thinking trees.
Where oft he mused and walked aloof
Still sighs the breeze, the bee still hums,
And, leaf-like, through the golden hours
Cicadas shrill in leafy gums.
As thus he mused, upon his eyes
(Perchance with sleepless brooding worn),
Through leafage gazing, biazed the blue
Of harbor-waters in the morn.
Maybe, what time he wandered lone
Down fronded paths and leafy lanes,
Bright Vision took him prisoner
And bound him in her magic chains.
Maybe, as lavish sunshine fell
On harbor side and harbor cape,
She, pointing, showed him through a mist
A wonder slowly taking shape.
Perchance she flashed across his mind
(Hearns vivid as when lightnings strike,
And unto him aloof, alone,
Vouchsafed a glimpse Hy-Brasil like.
Showed him, maybe, beyond tall ships,
Roofs rising up, and in the tire,
The golden fire of morn, wide-flung,
A city graced with dome and spire.
Perchance she silenced bee and bird,
All pleasant wood-notes, low and loud,
And gave him ears to hear alone
The sea-roar of a city proud.
Within the walls of Vaucluse House,
Walls wreathed with vines that press and
climb,
Unseen but felt, a Presence dwells,
A moulding Presence for all time.

A Portrait.
All brimming o’er with beauty like bluebells
dropping dew
Her steady eyes were bountiful of soul-lights
glancing through.
Her tresses gleamed like golden wine whene’er
she turned her head,
Enriched her marble cheeks and chin and
full lips rosy red.
Her nose combining dignity with keenness
aquiline
Said plainly, “There are chasms, sir, betwixt
your thoughts and mine.”
Her voice ran rippling like a brook, but
when she sang you’d hear
The trembling chords of memory and angels
hovering near.
She had a form that held in league restraint
and liberty—
The freedom of the fluttering leaves, the
bondage of the tree.
Olympian seemed her lineage, her realm in
dreams of art,
Her mission to play perfectly an ideal
woman’s part.
She frowned on my philosophy and smiling
taught me hers,
That lunacies half lucid were love’s best
interpreters.

The Rain.
O hear it! It has come at last—the rain
Tap-tapping, splashing on the window-pane.
Surging and rushing down the iron roofs,
Insistent, thunderous like beating hoofs.
The sound pervades the air; it ebbs and
flows
In tides of music as the north wind blows,
Now murmuring and whispering, again
Tempestuously beating on the pane,
Rapping and pelting stormily—the rain !
Beat down, beat down! Wash clean the
dusty air!
Refresh, restore what once was green and
fair,
These parching paddocks! Fill the falling
creek
For pity of the cattle starved and weak.
And patient, sheep! Still fall, still fall,
sweet rain!
Sweep down the roofs and flood the window-
pane !
The birds begin to twitter soft and sing,
And earth herself makes happy haste to
bring
Rich odors, incense of thank-offering.

ETHEL MARTYR.
The Drover’s Widow.
The bush is bright with blossom, and the
wattle-trees are flinging
Their treasure on the flats, where soldier-
reeds stand tall and straight;
The friendly slie-oaks murmur and the
creek goes by them singing
Through the paddocks of the homestead
where she leans across the gate.
She hears all day the lowing of the cattle
from the station
And the challenge of the stockwhips in the
hands of droving men;
And the songs she hears them singing swell
with notes of exultation,
For the grass that's green and tender
and the rivers full again.
In the closing dusk she wonders if he rides
with ghostly cattle
Down to secret pasturages and if southern
stars can glance
On the graves of other buslimen who went
forth with him to battle,
And whose camps are pitched for ever
where they fell asleep in France.
The bush is bright with blossom, and the
wattle trees are flinging
Their treasure on the flats where soldier-

The friendly she-oaks murmur and the

Through the paddocks of the homestead

To the Gums.
You are Australia!
Spin me no fair tales
Of wattle in its gold,
Or the bright
And burning waratah !
When the equinoctial gales
Stride the pale continent
With giant robes unfurled ;
When flood or drought
Mold us in savage thrall,
'Tis you, O g. and
And lovely gum-trees,
Who look up—look up and stand
Proudly before the world
With challenge to them all!
Strong, lithe and fearless,
Beautiful as day,
You stand and guard the way
That your great land must go!
Our lesser beauties die
When hardship passes by
Or desolations blow!
(Ah, dear Australia! land
Of whispers and of dim primeval ghosts
Too old for us to fear—
Phantoms of misty sorrow!
You are here !)
O lovely gum-trees,
Beautiful as light;
With new dreams in your goddess-eyes
by day,
Where the leafy lights wink out and in,
Opalled and whimsical.
Your eyes are grey ;
Your hair is tawny,
But the stars at night
Pelt it with moonstones,
Till the jealous day
Hastens again to burn them all away
In trembling morning, fires.
Your smooth, round arms
Shape themselves about your head
In Heavenward spires!
You are Australia!
Fragrant prettiness
Or scentless show
Are not Australia’s soul,
But grieving, whispering winds
And the deep, surging glow
Of essences of life
Towards a far, fair goal
Of greatness.
(O dear land!
The brave eucalyptus brings
Young stars to crown our heads,
And healing,
And grey wings.)

I Made a Little Song.
Through tho little green hours
I walked with the morn,
And I saw the wind shake
Yellow-tasseled corn.
I saw crimson birds limned
Against the blue sky,
And they lit each cloudlet
As they buttered by.
I walked o’er a hilltop,
And an almond-tree
Touched me with its pale hands
Very graciously.
And I made a small song
On that emerald morn,
Of the flame of red birds
And wind-shaken corn,
And the blossom fingers
Of the almond-tree
That when I was passing
Touched me graciously.

“Charges against the Premier were made in the Queensland Parliament, and a Royal Commission was demanded. Mr. King, M.L.A.. wlO ma e tre chatges, sail
that grounds existed for saying that one or more Ministers were implicated in robbery of public funds.”
S.A. (discussing the donkey branded Q.): “Terrible, isn’t it! They say the poor thing’s bosses have been taking bribes. „
N.S.W.: “Yes, awful! Now, if they’d only been like our bosses and GIVEN bribes—at our expense—it would have been too ordinary to be Worth talking about."

MORE REVENUE FOR BAVIN.
The N.S.W. Slang-Whangs bequeathed to
their successors an exhausted Treasury,
masses of unfinished loan works and huge
maturing debts totally unprovided for, to-
gether (of course) with an unemployed
problem of serious dimensions. Bavin and
Buttenshaw did not realise how bad the
position was till the general facts were
placed before them by Stevens, their
Assistant-Treasurer—the same who was
Slang-Whanged out of his job as Director
of Finance in 1925. Unfortunately, and
quite unnecessarily, Bavin promised the
electors that he would respect the most
important parts of what the Slang-Whangs
called their “humanitarian legislation.” Cer-
tainly he did not agree to continue the
child-endowment tax of 3 p.c. on the
amount of the- wages and salaries paid in
industrial establishments, and the burden of
that crazy impost will have to be lightened
and redistributed; but it was a mistake to
give an undertaking to continue Slang-
Whangism in any form. Bavin's party
would have done as well in the constitu-
encies, if not better, and his task as Trea-
surer would be much less formidable, had
he left himself free to repeal or reform the
“humanitarian legislation” if it were found
to be too great a load for the community
to carry. Bavin and Buttenshaw are also
bound by their election pledges not to raise
the income-tax, which is extortionate
already (companies pay 3s. in the £ on their
profits, in addition to Federal income-tax
and the child-endowment infliction) nor to
sanction the thumping increase in fares and
freight rates asked for by the Railway Com-
missioners. But they can’t escape the con-
sequences of Slang-Whangism, so they will
have to rake in a good deal more revenue.
They will need another £350,000 p.a. at
least, besides reducing their expenditure by
the same amount or more, to get within
measurable distance of merely balancing
the accounts.
•Js * sfc *
A tax that would bring in a substantial
amount without injuring industry in the
slightest degree or imposing hardship on
individuals would be a tax on entertain-
ments priced at less than 2s. 6d. There is
a Commonwealth tax where the charge is
2s. 6d. or more, so the State tax could be
collected by the Commonwealth officials at
a very small advance on the present cost of
collection. Evasion would be difficult and
infrequent, revenue would come in briskly
(there would be no waiting for 12 months,
as in the case of the income-tax), and the
public would have no reasonable cause for
complaint. For years the Commonwealth
tax was Id. on the first 6d. and id. on every
additional 6d. or part of 6d. In December,
1919, it was made id. in the 6d., and that
lasted for nearly three years. Then the
exemption was raised from sid. to llid., Is.
tickets being taxed Id. In October, 1925,
being about to go to the country, the
Bruce-Page Government dropped the tax
on payments below 2s. 6d., making the thing
2id. on 2s. 6d. and id. on every 6d. after
that. According to its own account, it thus
sacrificed revenue amounting in the first
year to £360,000, of which N. S. Wales’s
share would be quite £150,000. The West-
ralian Labor Government seized the oppor-
tunity to extract revenue from the aban-
doned field, its tax being Id. on the first Is.,
with an exemption of 9d., and id. on the
next 6d. or part of 6d.; its maximum was
thus 2id., the Commonwealth’s minimum.
If the N.S.W. Government did likewise, it
would probably get more than the £150,000
of Page’s estimate, for its show-going popu-
lation (greater relatively, as well as actually,
than that of any other State) is all the
time increasing. Performances of Australian
plays, operas, musical comedies and the
like, and even picture-shows at which the
fare was at least 75 p.c. Australian and the
rest British or British Dominion or both,
might be placed on the tax-free list. But
the State’s necessities are so great that even
that concession, proper in other circum-
stances, might be abandoned for the present.

The balance of the revenue required
could be got by borrowing another notion
from Westralia. That State draws between
£55,000 and £60,000 a year from its totali-
sator tax. The corresponding N. S. Wales
impost provided £233.000 last year, and the
yield is steadily shrinking, though the
volume of betting constantly increases. The
population of Westralia (taking the Com-
monwealth Statistician’s figures for the end
of 1926) is 374,996; that of N. S. Wales is
2,320,228. In Perth, which furnishes the
bulk of the tote-revenue (as Sydney does
in N. S. Wales), there is racing on Satur-
days and holidays only, whereas the Ma
State capital has a meeting nearly every
day of the week. Allowing for the smaller
attendances and lighter individual wager-
ing, the amount of racecourse betting in
Westralia may be reckoned at one-tenth
of- the N. S. Wales total (it is probably a
good deal less), yet the tote-revenue is
one-fourth of the N. S. Wales total, and is
approaching one-third. Why? Because, in
the first place, many Westralians bet on the
“straightout” totalisator, to which there is
no counterpart in N. S. Wales. This
machine returns such excellent prices that
the odds-cramping variety of bookmaker,
so numerous on Sydney courses, cannot
compete against it —another advantage to
the western State, for men who would
otherwise be objectionable parasites are
obliged to work. Then there are “place”
machines which also pay good dividends,
so much so that a man can back a horse
“both ways” with the assurance of showing
a profit if his fancy gets a place. This
oan’t be done, except in rare instances, on
Sydney racecourses. There the tote specu-
lator is restricted to an idiotic form of
“concession” betting. The method of dis-
tribution has been altered, three times in
four or five months (at present it is 50,
30 and 20 p.c. after deduction of 9 p.c.
for the Government, 3| p.c. for the club
and fractions of sixpences), and dividends
are so disappointing that more and more
backers are deserting the machine for the
bookmaker. If “straightout” and “place”
machines were available on all licensed
courses it is only reasonable to suppose that
the Westralian experience would be re-
peated. In that case the Bavin-Butten-
shaw Government would get another
£200,000 of tote-revenue, if not a great deal
more. And the change could be made
without expensive alterations, for on Rand-
wick, Warwick Farm and most other tracks
the tote buildings are rarely, if ever, used
to their full capacity. The existing
machinery w’ould suffice for the “place”
machine, and for the “straightout” imple-
ment blocks of numbered tickets and sheets
for the working out of dividends (which
should be exhibited as worked out) could
be obtained from the Government Printer
.—nothing else, except the clerks, is re-
quired.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Compulsory Unionism.
The Industrial Court of N.S.W. lately de-
cided that the non-unionists in the B. H.
Prop.’s steel works at Newcastle must join
the union within a month or expect the
usual consequences, which are persecution,
unemployment and scarcity of food for
themselves and families. The decision was
arrived at by a majority of one, and the
name of the one is Piddington. As there
are 2665 non-unionists at the steel works as
compared with 1147 unionists, this con-
scription edict may reasonably be described
as minority rule on a bis: scale. The law
doesn’t require wholesale compulsion of
this sort, it says that the Court “may"
order absolute preference to unionists,
which implies just as definitely that it may
not.
The only possible basis on which -com-
pulsory unionism can be considered fair
is that compulsory contributions should be
for the purposes of the union only, and
everything else should be voluntary. When
unscrupulous schemers use the union’s
powers of victimisation, suspension, expul-
sion and persecution to exact aids for their
particular brand of politics, the matter
becomes one of plain intolerance. Possibly
even Good Old Piddo would realise the
position if he were required to contribute
to the upkeep of some politics or religion
or newspaper or brewery which he detested,
the alternative being professional disquali-
fication and the loss.of his salary. It is
true that in the Broken Hill case the Com-
missioner declared that his award would be
“compulsory in name only” as the non-
unionists really wanted to join—which
doubtless explained why they didn’t jom.
It suggests that the heretic really wanted
to be burned, and that he burned him-
self despite all the efforts of the Inquisi-
tion, which played the hose on him con-
tinuously.

Tammany , in the Tub.
On September 8, 1900, a hurricane swept
over the island city of Galveston out of the
Gulf of Mexico. Enormous damage was
done, dwellings, stores, public buildings and
churches being levelled to the ground. Pre-
vious to this disaster the city had the ill-
repute of being one of the worst governed
in the United States. It was ruled by a
mayor, a body of aldermen and officials,
all elective and all apparently actuated by
personal and political motives. Its muni-
cipal history is said to have afforded illus-
trations “of almost every vice in local gov-
ernment.” Taxation was excessive, adminis-
tration was wasteful and inept, and political
crooks held the places of honor and profit.
This crazy and corrupt municipal machine
fell to pieces on top of the debris of the
city it had so wickedly misgoverned.
Among the ruins lay 6000 dead citizens, the
bridges connecting the city with the main-
land had been swept away, the water supply
was disorganised.
The Mayor and aldermen met and passed
resolutions, but their rotten administrative
machine refused to function. Then a num-
ber of business men formed an organisation
and took over control. On its own initia-
tive it set about restoring order. An appeal
was issued to citizens to rally round it.
“We believe,” said its authors, “that muni-
cipal government as it has been adminis-
tered in this community for the past 20
years has been a failure. It did not require
the storm to bring a realisation of this
fact, but it has brought it home with
greater force upon us. We are seeking
relief from the municipal destruction and
despair staring us in the face.” The citizens
rallied round the new organisation, and a
charter giving it legal authority was passed
through the State legislative body.
Thus sprang into being the first of those
municipal commissions which now hold the
reins of local government in approximately
500 cities in the United States. The pri-
mary influence that induced citizens to
discard the old for m of local government lay
in the fact that it had become an asylum
for providing sinecure offices for politicians,
had by graft and otherwise corrupted the
whole administrative office and taxed the
people excessively for a minimum of ser-
vice; a secondary influence which was soon
at work sprang from the fine results that
flov/ed almost instantly from the commission
system established in Galveston. An
example w’as offered of municipal thrift and
efficiency, demonstrating what strictly busi-
ness methods could accomplish, and, above
all, it furnished a fine lesson of the good
effect resulting from the banishment of
politics from municipal affairs.
The original Galveston commission was
based on the conception of a board of
directors, concentrating power, responsibility
and central executive direction in the hands
of a small body of experienced men. The
whole thing was conceived as a matter of
business and not as a matter of politics.
The commission’s authority was conveyed
by charter; at first its members held their
places by nomination, though later on the
elective principle was admitted. The cities
that followed the Galveston example have
taken authority either under charter or by
general legislation. In either case the mem-
bers of the commission do not, as a rule,
exceed five, one of whom is a “Mayor
President”; they are elected to office for a
term ranging from one year to six years and,
generally, membership is so adjusted that
portion only go up for election at the
one time. In some instances a further safe-
guard is provided by putting the municipal
officers and servants under a special board
and making an examination test a condition
of entrance.
In the case of Sydney, the govern-
ment of the city will not undergo -an
entirely new experience in being put in
commission; but the meaning attached to
the phrase has hitherto been the inter-
position of a merely temporary authority.
The question, however, arises whether it
would not be well for the Bavin Ministry
to so constitute its commission that it may
take a permanent form based generally oil
the successful American plan.

The Constitution and the Railways.
The Royal Commission on the amend-
ment of the Constitution is hitting up such
a pace that it would be well to make its
job hereditary so that its sons can be
brought up to inherit the business. It
hears all sorts of people, from a defeated
Labor member seeking to burst the con-
nection with the empire, to Military
Director-General Ci-iauvel advocating a
Bourke-Darwin railway through South-
West Queensland in place of the South-to-
North line which is in the bond. As the
report reads:—
"He did not regard a direct railway between
Adelaide and Darwin as satisfactory from
a defence point of view. In his opinion a
line should be built between Bourke
(N.S.W.-) and Darwin, and connected with
the East-to-West line by the most direct
route. That would enable reinforcements
to be sent direct to Darwin in case of
emergency from the main centres of popu-
lation. Otherwise troops from the Eastern
States would have to be sent through Adel-
aide, and serious delay would result.”
Yet the 4ft. Biin. line is finished from Syd-
ney to Broken Hill, and a comparatively
short extension over easy country would
join Sydney by a standard gauge with the
South-to-North railway. This latter is being
constructed, though a great deal too slowly,
but if the snail-like Bruce, or his successor,
could only be moved to lay a third rail
over the existing track as a temporary
measure, and build the rest of the road on
the standard gauge instead of the 3ft. 6in.
freak, a uniform 4ft. Biin. from Sydney to
Darwin should be a matter of very few
years. It would be no longer than the way
through Western Queensland about which
axes are ground so assiduously. For troops
rushing from Melbourne to Darwin to push
the Chinese hordes into the sea the track
through Adelaide looks distinctly more con-
venient than anything that could be sup-
plied through South-West Queensland. Curi-
ously enough the commission, on which
S.A. isn’t represented, wasn’t of a sufficiently
inquiring nature to ask any questions about
the discrepancy in the evidence, and if it is
too tired to bore into things it won’t get
far, though it may be long enough on the
road.
In the matter of altering the silly 31ft.
gauge on the partly built South-to-North, it
may or may not be relevant to mention that
the United States once unified 14.500 miles
of mixed gauges in two days, and that the
English Great Western was altered from
end to end in four days. Still it must be
admitted that the men who had the job in
hand were hurrying.
The U.S. and Us.
“Economic Aspects of Trade between U.S.
and Australia” is an essay read to the Eco-
nomic Society (N.S.W. branch) by the U.S.
Trade Commissioner, E. C. Squire. An
accompanying letter, signed by “E. Ronald
Walker, hon. sec.,” says that Mr. Squire's
effort “effectively dispels some current delu-
sions regarding trade relations with the
United States,” and the word ’“’effectively”
is interesting. The Bulletin suspects that
Mr. Walker is one of that class of Free-
trade survivals which Sydney Uni. turns
out in some quantity—men who would be
liable to prompt fiscal conversion if they
started boot factories and hustled with the
importer and the realities of life under the
auspices of Piddington’s court instead of
living in a rarefied atmosphere of 150-years-
old Adam Smith-ism. It was the fate of
poor Smith to dree his weird in days when
international credit was hardly dreamt of,
and he didn’t quite realise that a country,
by trading a dashed sight too freely, might
import, in a single year, £42,000,000 worth
more than its exports provided for, and add
that amount to its foreign debt, as Aus-
tralia did in 1921-22. If he had he might
have been a different Smith, and Sydney
might have had a different university.
Mr. Squire, who probably thinks, like
many of his countrymen, that Freetrade i?
good enough for Australia though not much
use for the United States, delivers himself
of a mass of platitudes, but none of them
touch the real issue, which is:—
That Australia bought from the U.S. in
1925-26 £37,234,257 wrnrth of goods and sold
to it only £12,953,877 worth, the balance
against this country being thus £24,280,380.
That this is the regular course of trade
with the U.S.. and that there is no other
case to equal it in all our foreign dealings.
That Australia should have had in 1925-26
some £30,000,000 excess of exports with
which to meet interest and other charges
abroad; but as. it had the usual excess of
imports instead, by reason of its dealing s
with the United States, it added something


over £39,000,000 to its overseas debt. This
made £136,000,000 added in five years.
That this being the road to national bank-
ruptcy, something should be done to put the
trade accounts on a better footing, and
Uncle Samuel is the right person to start
with, because our adverse balance with him
is the only one that is big enough to meet
the case.
It would be a pity if any gentleman, con-
nected or disconnected with the Stonehenge
brand of economics, should rush to the con-
clusion that any of the above “cunTent
delusions” have been “dispelled” because a
United States gentleman who is paid to
push his country’s trade here has been
doing his duty. One of his duties is to dis-
pense soothing syrup to credulous people
when the trade situation is attracting rather
much attention.

The Alleged Downfall of Bronstein.
It is reported that Trotsky, whose real
name is Bronstein, and a number of his
adherents, most of them also with aliases,
have at last been pushed out of the Com-
munist oligarchy and told to go and be
part of the common herd.
Trotsky began to lose his multifarious
jobs nearly three years ago. The major
charge said to have been laid against liis
crowd was that they sought to put Soviet
Russia on some semblance of a democratic
basis. In theory communism is “a state
of society in which common property is
the recognised form,” and where all are
equal, as with the Early Christian com-
munity at Jerusalem and the New Aus-
tralians in Paraguay. But though Russia
talks about common property, its Com-
munists are a narrow, arrogant and self-
important oligarchy to which admission is
difficult, and it runs the Government, army,
police, finance, industry, trade, trade-
unions, co-operative institutions and the
whole educational system. The mode of
alleged Parliamentary election is compli-
cated. The people elect by open voting,
under the official eye, the “Volost Soviets,”
a town worker having five times the voting
power of a peasant, who is viewed as an
obstinate animal, with bad opinions about
the private ownership of his farm. The
Communist authority conducts the election
and annuls it or otherwise as it pleases.
Less than 12 per cent, of the people entitled
to vote on an occasion five years ago were
Communists. The business of these humble
preliminary bodies is to elect the “district
Soviets,” and they are said to be 54 per cent.
Communist. These secondary institutions
elect the “Government Soviets,” which are
said to be nearly 79 per cent. Communist;
and these, again, created the “All-Russian
Soviets,” which were 94| per cent. Com-
munist on the occasion in question. The
last stage is the creation of the Executive,
and it is expected to be all Communist.
The deceased Lenin said his plan was to
“create a bureaucracy against democracy
inside the party,” and he succeeded very
well. If Trotsky and his group of friends
really proposed to break up this beautiful
system and let the masses, especially the
peasant masses, attempt some genuine rul-
ing, they were probably mad, though it may
be that they thought the system was about
to collapse, and wanted to make themselves
solid with the new order before parting
from the old one.
If it should prove true that Trotsky
has been fooling with democratic ideals, he
will certainly earn the profound contempt
of the Jock Garden school of Com-
munists in Australia. It regards the pre-
sent Moscow style as very pleasant and
desirable for leading lights such as it is
willing to supply, and something that will
suit Australia down to the ground when
Australia gets used to it.

Bradfield and His Bridge.
One of the first swishes of the new broom
wielded by the Bavin-Buttenshaw coali-
tion in N. S. Wales is more or less directed
against Bradfield of the Bridge. Three
years ago, when the plans were first pub-
lished, the architectural and engineering
journals of the world commented on them,
mostly in a complimentary manner. It was
left to the English Engineering to advance
the theory that Bradfield was absurdly and
extravagantly wrong in putting heavy
towers at each end of his mighty arch.
Lately this criticism has been given a
new lease of life by W. H. Ifould, head of
the Public Library, who insists that the
successful tenderers for the bridge sub-
mitted a design in which the towers were
non-existent. But, even so, Bradfield’s
towers are now probably past praying for.
Their foundations and a considerable part
of the superstructure have been done, and
to alter the design at this stage would in-
evitably mean discord and delay.
A point has been made of the fact that
a lot of money would be saved by not
building the towers, but a lot of money is
being wasted every week because the bridge
assumes shape so slowly. The contractors
don’t care how long the job takes. Their
agreement protects them against practically
all labor troubles. But the tax-paying
public is deeply concerned. Every week
that the bridge is delayed means anything
from £2OOO to £6OOO in wasted interest.
When £2,000,000 has been spent on it,
the interest burden is £2OOO per week; by
the time the last bolt is driven it will be
at least £6OOO a week. What the Bavin-
Buttenshaws ought to do is to ask its
engineer to hustle on with the work and to
make recommendations immediately as to
the best methods of accelerating progress.
Shell-shock.
Dear Bulletin, —“Si.inga,” who confesses
himself a soldier, puts this question (B.
20/10/’27): “Is it too much to ask to-day
that a bad mental or psychological break-
down on the part of an individual [soldier]
should be blamed on the psychiatrist who
passed him as psychologically fit?” The
answer is yes; it is too much to ask. No
alienist or psychiatrist would, if he could,
certify to a recruit’s fitness or otherwise for
experiences which in the nature of things
he is debarred from imitating.
Physical fitness for active service is cap-
able of being decided by various more or
less reliable tests. The soundness of a
man’s vital organs and limbs can be ascer-
tained by trials analogous to those likely
to be experienced in actual warfare. No
tests, however, are or should be available
to try a human being’s psychical centres.
Being buried alive, blown up by high
explosives, having mutilated portions of
another human’s frame hurled at the can-
didate for enlistment —these would be but
a few of the minor horrors which if imitable
might test the recruit’s psyche. Who would
care to mimic these genuine horrors, all
and each of which are contributory factors
to actual shell-shock?
No. To dabble with the alleged com-
plexes of “misunderstood” females is one
thing; to try a would-be soldier’s hold on
sanity and mental balance by devilishly
ingenious artefacts would be neither pos-
sible nor advisable. Let us content our-
selves with trying to assure the warrior’s
corpore sano, while hoping that he will
emerge from war’s alarums with as much
of his mens sana as such a mad man-made
method of settling human differences per-
mits.—Yours, etc., S.N.R.

Black Brother and the Flicks.
Some evidence was given before the Films
Commission in Sydney which is worth the
attention alike of those who see in the
cinema a means of moral and educational
uplift and of those who find convincing evi-
dence of mental and moral deterioration
as the result of its activities. The witness
was J. T. Beckett, formerly a Chief Inspec-
tor of Aborigines, and, though his remarks
apply particularly to the effect exercised
on the mind of primitive races by the
cinema, a good many of his conclusions
apply to our own social fabric, and especi-
ally to that very youthful section of civi-
lised communities which is never far re-
moved from the primitive.
Beckett’s final conclusion is that it is not
only undesirable but dangerous to allow
such races as our own aborigines access to
films of all types and varieties. The in-
discriminate introduction of these to such
populous native communities as New
Guinea and Papua he considers likely to
prove even more disastrous. The effect of
the American “gunman” and “crook” type
of film on the Australian abo. he finds
very marked. On the other hand, the sex
films bore the abo. He is eagerly respon-
sive, as might be expected, to the Tom
Mix type of horseman-gunman, and, like
the children of civilisation, is showing a
tendency to imitate his heroes, often in dis-
concerting ways. These and the “crook”
films are helping him to contempt for the
old wholesome prohibitions, just as is too
often happening in the case of the
Caucasian children who throng in thou-
sands to the “pitchers” every Saturday
afternoon throughout Australia, to receive
not too wholesome impressions from them.
As to the sex film, in which Hollywood
has wallowed so long, Mr. Beckett con-
siders that it is already bearing evil fruit
in New Guinea and Papua, amid races that,
while not so attracted to the type of film
beloved of the Australian abo., are all
eyes and ears for a subject which they
readily understand. In these films, too, the
breaking down of the old prohibitions is
exalted or condoned every day. Child-like
as his brother of Australia, the Island
primitive thinks, as does the former, “If
this sort of thing can be done with im-
punity by those people in the picture, why
can’t I join in?” The result of his reflections
is shown in the steadily increasing list
of serious offences against white women in
New Guinea and Papua, where a few years
ago sex criminality of the sort was un-
known. There are probably other contri-
buting reasons, but there is no doubt that,
the influence of the salacious and criminal
film has had the effect the ex-Protector
describes. Throughout India and Eastern
Asia, and in Africa from the Cape to Cairo,
the same lesson is being forced home, and
the white overlord in some cases is en-
deavoring to mitigate the harm done
already by stricter censorship and super-
vision of distribution. It is more than
likely that some action of the sort will
have to be taken in Papua and New Guinea
before long.

Long Apprenticeship.
J. C. Valentine, Queensland secretary of
the locomotive engmemen, who was with
the Australian Industrial Mission in the
U.S.A., has been saying hard words against
the long apprenticeship system in vogue
in Australia—a stupid system that practi-
cally shuts out a youth from the skilled
trades after he has reached the age of 16.
A long apprenticeship in the old days, when
a worker was expected to master his whole
craft, admitted of defence; but to-day, with
the subdivision of trades, automatic mach-
inery and mass production, it represents a
criminal waste of time. It has to be re-
membered that a large percentage of our
boys receive some technical training during
school-days. Many of those who start in
“white shirt” occupations would later take
on some trade if they could, but the way
is closed to them; they must stay in their
dead-end jobs. Yet a two- or three-years’
apprenticeship would lift them into the
comparative security of continuous employ-
ment.
In this connection it is interesting to
recall that Edison, whose inventions have
never been equalled by any other one man
in the world’s history, only began to be a
mechanic when he was of such an age that
his entrv to the business would have been
impossible had he lived in Australia to-day.

Rejuvenation.
The Steinach Rejuvenation film, now
being screened in Australia, shows a man
of 70, thin, tottering, worn out like an old
suspender. The operation is performed—
you are allowed to be cinematically present
at the operation—and presto! the greybeard
is climbing mountains. To the average
spectator the goal for which Faustus cashed
in his immortal soul has been reached. One
can go gaily along the primrose path con-
fident that when the primroses give out
one’s family practitioner, by means of a
little cutting under a local anaesthetic. will
enable one to retrace one’s steps indefin-
itely. Superficially nothing could be more
frank and open; actually nothing could be
more easily faked. Some of Steinach’s
fellow-scientists assert that the improve-
ment. claimed can be explained entirely by
the effect of auto-suggestion. Professor
Zeissel, also of Vienna, a well-known scien-
tist 69 years old, submitted to the operation
and recounted his experiences in the Vienna
Medical Journal. A lessened sexual power
and interest was all he noted—the scien-
tific mind is apt to be immune from the
influence of suggestion. Most of the stories
of German and Austrian operations are
said to be the same. An old man, flaccid,
unhappy, comes to the operating-table. He
feels bucked up a little and puts on a little
fat, but that is no more rejuvenation than
is the feeling of renewed youth following
a glass of beer. One authenticated case
is of a rejuvenated subject who went the
pace for six months and then suddenly
expired. The Steinachians say he overdid
things, but the sceptical will be inclined
to say that the restoration of one portion
of the body when the rest of the tissues
are like perished elastic must always ■ be
risky.
The medical profession in Australia might
take a little more interest in this film. If
the thing is quackery it ought to be exposed.
It gets in the way of a proved achievement
in genuine rejuvenation due to the medical
profession—the raising of the expectation
of life in the last half-century from between
35 and 40 years to over 50.

An Armistice in S’Africa.
The bitter quarrel between the Dutch
Nationalist and the other parties in S’Africa
over the design of a national flag has sub-
sided in a truce. The flag suggested by
the Nationalist Government and its Labor
allies was a combination of the old republi-
can flags of the Free State and Transvaal,
omitting any reference to the Imperial con-
nection, such as the Union Jack, which
appears as part of the flags flown by other
oversea States of the Empire. To this the
British population objected, and they were
backed by the Dutch section which fol-
lows Smuts and with him stands for honor-
ing the peace treaty of 1902. For the dis-
pute goes much further than one between
Britain and Boer. In brief, it is an issue
between the Dutch secessionists and the
combined opposition which sees that the
country’s best chance of progress lies in
maintaining the Imperial connection. The
compromise sees the Union Jack “charged”
in conjunction with the old republican
flags, on a noncommittal tricolor, while the
Union Jack will remain, as heretofore, the
Imperial symbol.
To us at this distance it seems a trivial
matter to arouse such feeling; but Aus-
tralia is not a nation sharply divided by
the memory of two wars and century-old
antagonisms, and there is no doubt that the
situation in the Union was a serious one.
Both sides have compromised, but whether
the agreement will hold remains to be seen.
Hertzoc has to face a general election soon.
He holds office only by virtue of his pact
with the Labor party, British almost to a
man, and many of them against the original
Nationalist flag scheme. The provincial
elections some months ago showed a
decided South African party majority over
the Nationalist-Labor candidates. To have
any chance of carrying the Union elections
some placation of the pro-Union Jack vote
was therefore necessary. That seems to
be the reason for Hertzog’s change of
front, and for the sudden muzzling of such
Nationalist die-hards as Malan and others
of the pro-secessionists.

The Dearth of School-teachers.
So acute has become the shortage of
teachers in Vic., even after the importation
of 40 from Britain at the beginning of the
year, that the Minister of Education has
been obliged to refuse two pressing de-
mands for high schools in the eastern sub-
urbs of Melbourne. Both schools had been
promised by his predecessor, but Mr.
Lemmon said that he could not further
deplete the primary staffs for such a pur-
pose. The Education Department pro-
fesses not to be able to discover the reason
for this shortage, which has been gettting
worse for the past 20 years.
But there is no mystery about it. Of the
2167 men employed in the primary branch
86 receive from 10 guineas to 11 guineas a
week, and their average length of service
is over 37 years; 855 receive from £6 10s.
to £lO a week, with service averaging 30
years; the remainder receive from £3 to £6
a week. State secondary teachers are paid
slightly higher salaries than these. The
cause may lie also somewhere behind such
actions of the department as importing
teachers upon the distinct understanding
that they would be placed at the bottom of
the lowest division of the classified roll,
where they would have to work their way
up in fair competition, and then giving two
of these teachers with not six months’ ser-
vice lectureships at the Teachers’ College
without such positions being opened for
competition by advertisement.
If the new Minister is earnest in his
desire to increase educational facilities, he
might also find out why a new secondary
inspector was appointed without the depart-
ment advertising the fact that one was
needed. Nothing kills the spirit of service
quicker than nepotism, veiled or otherwise.
♦—
Historical Parallels.
“Sol Malaprop”: I take an interest in these
men who sit on the Industrial Bench and
hand down daily and hourly decisions which
always show their intense conscientiousness,
and generally also a profound ignorance of
business problems. The point is that a
desire to do the right thing and some know-
ledge of law, either civil or ecclesiastical,
are not sufficient for all purposes.
In this connection reference may be made
to another court —the new permanent Inqui-
sition which was set up in Spain in the
time of Ferdinand and Isabella, and which,
to a great extent, made its own regulations
and ran itself. In its early days its chief
interest lay in hunting up the relapsed
Jewish or Mohammedan convert, and also
anyone suspected of “Judaising,” and con-
fiscating his life and all his property. In
its zeal to achieve the absolutely correct
caper the Inquisition took to making its
awards retrospective. It made them so
retrospective that they might go back 40
years to the date of the accused’s burial.
So if Don Smith fell into heresy in 1418,
and was buried still unsuspected in 1458,
and his sin was proved to the satisfaction
of the tribunal in 1498, the confiscation
took effect 80 years back. The result was
that such of Don Smith’s property as could
be found in the hands of the heirs was for-
feited, and anything else they had, just
in order to make sure.
That was a preparatory measure. Then
the seizure spread and extended to all
moneys which had been paid out of the sin-
ner’s estate since he first began sinning,
whether paid for lands, houses, groceries,
clothes or boots, or lost at cards, or given
to the bookmaker when one of the family
went to the bullfight and backed the cow
that ran last. This introduced an unsettling
element into every kind of monetary trans-
action, and, as many an embittered Hebrew
probably remarked, it was “bad for bith-
nith.” Nothing down to a tram ticket was
assuredly valid.
Still the early Inquisitors did their best.
They were upright and hard-w r orking men,
burping, # in every sense of the word, to do
good, and if, in their zeal, some of their
awards wrecked the finances of the railway
system or closed up a number of factories
and made armies of unemployed, they
merely said that they were appointed to
carry out the law as they read it in the
light of conscience, and to dash the con-
sequences.
In this respect Torquemada and Piddinc-
ton are a pair. But Torquemada doesn’t
know it because he is dead and Piddington
doesn’t know it because he doesn’t know
himself.

It was by a streak of luck that the two
Melbourne undesirables, Cutmore and
“Squizzy” Taylor, were killed in their duel.
In Sydney and Melbourne, and other places
as well, it appears that the Law is losing
badly in its skirmish with the offensive
classes, and the latter are acquiring some-
thing so much like a prescriptive right to
be offensive that the mob regards the spec-
tacle of one of them being arrested as
almost a personal insult. Some remedies
are
(1) There should be more and better-paid
police and they should be reserved for police
duties.
(2) Much less bail and more of it —that
is to say higher bail. When a criminal is
in gaol awaiting trial his facilities for burg-
lary and assault are diminished.
' (3) A minimum as well as a maximum
punishment for attacks on the police. To
assail the Law’s embodiment should be akin
to sacrilege.
(4) Disqualification of convicted persons
as voters for lengthy periods. This would
reduce the interest that the local member or
alderman takes in them.
(5) An extensive and well-considered
system of deportation.
(6) Juries of 15 or some other odd
number and a majority verdict, it being
much more difficult to square or terrorise
seven or eight men than one.
(7) The abolition of the city and subur-
ban J.P., except in the capacity of a witness
of documents.

POLITICAL
POINTS
There is something a thousand times more
important and urgent than the removal of
Kay and Treble awaiting the attention of
the Bavin Government. That is (1) the re-
arrangement of the gerrymandered Assembly
electorates, and (2) the reform of the Leg.
Council. The division of the State into
electoral districts was a greater scandal even
than the appointment of Kay. Of course
it will be argued that the division was made
by a commission with Justice James one of
three members; so for a start Justice James
might be asked whether he is prepared to
personally certify that the division made was
the most just and equitable possible.
South Australia’s railways are experiencing
the inevitable crisis. Big debts, high interest,
dear coal, increased wages, shortened hours
and a rather ordinary season made the loss
for 1926-27 £1,118,252, or about 19 times that
of the year before, and the effect of the 44-
hour week granted by Judges Detliridge and
Beeby when it was clear there was going to
be a bad season is an additional trouble for
1927-28. As fares and freight rates are
mostly above the Australian average already,
the prospect is that to put them up any more
would only make revenue less. So the deci-
sion is to discharge 2000 of the staff, which
numbered 10,802 at the end of June.
The National Debt Commission, an institu-
tion which carries water uphill in a sieve,
bought and extinguished £6,405,000 worth
of securities in the financial year, and, ac-
cording to the S. M. Herald, “the national
debt was reduced by that amount.” This
makes 29 or 30 millions of reduction since
1919, but the total owing grows wonderfully
all the same. The birth-rate of liabilities
exceeds the death-rate easily. Another paper
prophesied:—
By the national debt sinking fund all debts owing
before 1923 will be wiped out in 30 years, and
other debts in 50 years or less.
But supposing Australia accumulated the
money required in the time stated, it would
be only paper money, of no use abroad what-
ever. Unless this country can make its
exports larger than its imports and its exter-
nal interest bill, it won’t pay off any exter-
nal liabilities ill 50 centuries.
Studying Dominions Sec. Amery well
while in his company from Mildura to Melb.,
Jones, Bailey and two other Labor Ministers
summed him up as a Conservative gifted
with vision and imagination. Amery’s inter-
est in everything was no pose but the real
thing, and he showed an appreciation of the
other fellow’s point of view. It was advan-
tageous all round to have Cabineteers like
Jones and Bailey, who count, associated with
Amery for a few days, but it would have
been better still if Premier Hogan, who has
an infinite capacity for taking pains over
small things, could have left his minnows for
a few days to go to Mildura and back.
Aided by the banks, which have been put-
ting the screw on importers, Maoriland has
got its trading balance into a state where
there’s at least something left in London to
pay J. Bull liis interest. Figures for nine
months ending September last year showed
£57,448 excess of imports. This year there’s
an excess of exports to the tune of 4J mil-
lions. Yet exports have increased in value by
half a million only.
Some queer pabulum is included in Trea-
surer Page’s Budget, as printed, notably the
expectation of life at date of birth in the
Commonwealth and 15 other countries. The
figures for Australia (it comes second to
Maoriland) are 59.15 years for males and
63.31 years for females; among the coun-
tries compared, to their disadvantage, are
England and AVales (51.5 and 55.4), U.S.A.
(49.9 and 53.2), Japan (44.3 and 44.4) and
Italy (43.6 and 44.7). Perhaps the idea of
tacking this information on to the Budget
is to reconcile the overseas creditor to the
size of the Australian debt.
Phil Collier, the Westralian Labor Pre-
mier and Treasurer, made a generous re-
MUM’S THE WORD!
“Those who said there were not sufficient police should ask themselves whether they were not invit-
ing a crime wave by making such remarks.” — Vic. Chief Sec Prendergast.
CANUTE PRENDERGAST: “What’s worrying you now?”
JOHN CITIZEN : “Ahem, there seems to be a lack of life-saving appliances.”
CANUTE PRENDERGAST: “S-sh! Not so loud, you fool—the waves might hear you!”
ference to Opposition-leader Jimmy Mitchell
in winding up his Budget speech. He said
that the slump in mining would have had
serious consequences but for the great
advance in the agricultural and pastoral
industries, and that Mitchell had “played an
important part in turning the attention of
the people to the possibilities of land settle-
ment.” A slight thing, perhaps, but the
feeling of which it is an expression is honor-
able to both parties and helpful to the coun-
try.
Sydney City Council owns a pub, and it
leased the same for £2O per week, though
other competitors o'ffered £23 and £27. The
rent was presently reduced to £lB on the
alleged report of the City Assessor that there
were only seven bedrooms apart from those
occupied by the pub-keeping family, and that
they “were generally vacant.” Nevertheless
19 “permanent boarders” wanted to exercise
the municipal lodger franchise on behalf of
this humble drinkery (it is named the Sir
George Grey), and the house books professed
that they lived there, and some others
besides. If all these people live and board
in the flesh something should be done under
the Over-stuffing Act.
Short shrift was given to Laborite
Murphy’s Fair Rents Courts Bill in Vic.
Uppah Chambah; by 17 votes to 5 it was
knocked out on the motion for its second
reading. Knowing that the measure would
be slaughtered in the Plush House non-
Laborites did not bother to maul it when it
was before the Assembly.
One unfortunate feature of the railway
retrenchment policy in South Aus. is that
returned soldiers will suffer, for the most
part. Since the war the S. Aus. Railway
Department has given a steady preference
to Diggers when engaging labor, and 1456
repatriated warriors were added to the staff
last year. They will nearly all have to go,
and other A.I.F. men with them, unless the
Bruce-Pages come to the rescue. The Bruce-
Pages could help with grants-in-aid, like
those so freely handed to Westralia, and by
pushing on with the construction of the
North-South and Port Augusta-Redhill rail-
ways.
A new Liberal League has been formed in
Melbourne, with Donald Mackinnon, formerly
Attorney-General, as president. It seems
to be very much like the “Australian Liberal
party” which, after a strenuous campaign,
managed to get one member into the Assembly
at the April election ; the one member —Gray,
of St. Kilda —is a vice-president of the
newest organisation. If it lasts till the
winter months the league may serve the pur-
poses of a debating society, but it gives no
promise of getting beyond that stage.
Compulsory unionism, which “Good old
Piddo” would foist upon N. S. Wales,
already exists in Queensland. One result
is that the union of civil servants is affili-
ated with the central executive of the
Parliamentary Labor party and with the
Brisbane Trades and Labor Council. Object-
ing to this latter body, which is as silly as
the Sydney Trades and Labor Council, if
not sillier, some of the civil servants de-
manded a ballot on the question of affiliation,
and won it by 143 to 130. But the result
ot the ballot was ignored by ‘"the executive”
on the ground—as one of its spokesmen
cheekily explained—that 40 p.c. of the
members hadn’t voted and “silence meant
consent to affiliation’ ; and as “the execu-
tive” is all-powerful where unionism is com-
pulsory, civil servants who loathe the Trades
and Labor Council will have to contribute
to its support in order to keep their jobs.
Since the first lot of Federal public ser-
vants reached Canberra a library of woe has
been growing up. One marooned individual
recently wrote in the press:—
One can easily understand how a man takes to
drink, as there is no other way of banishing the per-
petual gloom and depression after nightfall.
And what on earth is to be done about it?
Nothing ran make the place a seaport or a
river port. It has no more prospects than the
next spot of being a manufacturing or a
mining centre. Even if a main line was
shifted so that an occasional train would
go through, that would only lift it into the
same category as any other place where the
train acts similarly. Canberra is an attempt
at a baby Washington without the Potomac
and the chance of big ships coming, and it is
planted on a bigger area than Washington
with a great deal less to put on the area.
Reported that two Australians (male and
female) who were passengers by the Niagara
from their own country to Canada drifted
ashore at Honolulu to get some value out
of the money which they had paid for the
U.S. Consul’s autograph on their passports
and were left behind. Next day they applied
for permission to travel to their destination
on another steamer, and via San Francisco,
but “the other branch of the Anglo-Saxon
race” put on its most inhospitable expression.
Instead of asking if the two were parte 1
from their money and offering a little finan-
cial accommodation, it refused them per-
mission to journey as proposed and put them
under arrest. Th e date of execution wasn’t
immediately fixed, so that was something
they can be thankful for.
Since the British mission quitted Russia
the worst-tempered Government on earth
has been chewing soap to simulate a froth,
and arresting all manner of people on a
charge of being British spies. The ex-
secretary of th e mission says that “the Rus-
sian authorities are apprehending every man,
woman and child with whom I came into
contact during 27 years.” Some of the trials
are public, but probably the most are pri-
vate. “Espionage” is one of the long list
of crimes which are dealt with by military
tribunals in Sovietland, and these 'bodies
have wide latitude to be as secretive in their
convictions and as prompt in their execu-
tions as they please.
After waiting for 67 years, Melbourne has
seen a bridge across the Yarra, from Spencer-
street to Clarendon-street, begun at last.
The first pile for a coffer-dam was driven
the other day by Jones, Minister for Works,
who was chiefly instrumental in getting the
authorising bill passed. Instead of the
design that won the £750 prize offered by the
Allancocks, one providing for a steel-girder
structure has been adopted. The work will
cost £200,000, and two years is a modest
estimate of the time that will be taken.
The furious attack made by Sean O’Kelly,
of the Irish Republican party, on the Cos-
grave Ministry is a reminder that the gentle-
man came here in 1923 to collect funds for
a gory insurrection in his native land. He
and an accomplice were deported, not by
the Commonwealth, which the High Court
has decided, perhaps wrongly, hasn’t the
power, but by a State, which evidently has.
With this refreshing precedent to guide it,
and with the power to strengthen the law if
such a course seems necessary, N.S.W.’s
non-Labor Cabinet might consider whether
there are not too many imported people here
who are preparing for gory insurrection
quite as flagrantly as Mr. O’Kelly, and
that in Bavin’s own homeland.
The introduction of the Agricultural
Bank Bill by the Hogan Government in the
Vic. Assembly chamber in Spring-street,
Melbourne, recalls that George Turner
brought forward a State Bank Bill in the
same place nearly 30 years ago. He proposed
an institution like the present Common-
wealth Bank, to be operative within the
limits of the then colony. Shiels killed the
measure with one speech. Labor has wisely
decided to make its rural bank an adjunct
of the Savings Bank. All the same, it is
doubtful whether the measure will get
through the Plush House.
If Industrial Judges know little or nothing
of either industry or finance, and are not
concerned to learn one or the other, they are
apt to play the part of the legal luminaries
mentioned very unpleasantly in Luke ii,
verse 46. There is, at times, an element of
the grotesque about the way a judicial
gentleman with a big salary, a steady job,
only a domestic staff to insure and not
enough of a wage-bill to bring him inside the
child endowment tax hands out heavy
burdens to real producers, and tells them
that they will never notice the difference.

Needs not so much a seaman’s skill
As front of brass and wit that will

Then say what know you of the art
Of spilling from a bursting heart

But still there’s mope, much more, tot learn.

Among the chosen few
Must take the course of jeers and gibes
And hot impassioned diatribes
Which usage sanctions and prescribes.

So you would be a leader,
And sit in Parliament?
Now say what know you of the game
Of grabbing praise and dodging blame,
Of simulating noble aim
And righteous intent?
All this you know? Your task’s complete.
Step in, my lad, and take your seat!
For who would be accounted
A politician true
Must graduate in sly finesse,
Mislay a conscience, more or less,
And —well, perhaps you now can guess
What councils did for you !

things, two 12in. lengths of braided elastic,
two 21in. lengths of bottom ribbon and
two 21in. lengths of top ribbon. Thus, not
counting bows, ornaments, etc., the material
used actually measures 108 inches, or nine

body’s surprise, “Ginger’s” name was called
out by the postal orderly. And Ginger dubi-
ously took delivery of an envelope re-
addressed on to him from the office where he
had been employed prior to enlisting. The
enclosure proved to be from the secretary of
some recruiting committee; it reminded
Ginger that he had promised to enlist at the
end of 1915, pointed out that so far there
was no record of his having done so, and con-
cluded by requesting him to report at the
recruiting office as soon as he could find it
convenient. A lot of us proffered our assist-

plate and the framing. The boiler, the most
vital part, may not last 10 years if it is
a “bad-water” area. Provision is made on
the Vic. railways for periodical examinations,
beginning when the boiler is seven years old,
or has run 280,000 miles, whichever event
occurs first. After 131 years, or 475,000
loco, miles, the chief mechanical engineer

soul. In between the two raids he had had
his name taken by the police for being on
the premises of an alleged club where drinks
were being consumed unlawfully, and a few
hours before he had got into holts with a
traffic inspector for driving his car at an
excessive pace. One of the difficulties that

“Oxmead”: “Prince Garol of Roumania
Makes a Bid for a Lost Throne” was one
of last week’s cable headlines. There seems
to be something about the name Charles and
its variants that inseparably associates it
with lost thrones. It intrudes in almost every
instance where there is a prominent claimant
to a crown. My dictionary comprehensively
defines “Carlist” as “in Franco a supporter
of Charles X. and his line; in Spain a sup-
porter of the pretender Don Carlos de Bour-
bon.” England’s last two pretenders were
both Charleses. The last of the Hapsburgs
who made an attempt to regain the throne of
Hungary was ex-king Karl, and there was,
no luck about the enterprise. Charles, or
anything like it, is such a shockingly un-
lucky name that it. is a wonder royalty
hasn’t abjured it long ago.

“W.1.U.”: Railway workers living along
lines over which coal is carried rarely need
to buy fuel; those between Port Pirie and
Cockburn (S.A.) seem to have been on a
specially good wicket. So much dropped off
trucks that the sparsely-populated length of
ISO miles between Peterborough and Broken
Hill began to look like a continuous coal
seam. At last the authorities decided to
gather the jetsam up and sell it in hundred-
weight bags at a shilling a time. When
even this hadn’t much perceptible effect,
instructions were given to clean all the coal
up for the locomotive department. The
amount collected was 350 tons, the depart-
ment paying fl a ton to cover labor charges.

“Bad Australian”: There are perpetual
complaints about the paucity of Australian
news in American newspapers. But occa-
sionally something really startling is pub-
lished, as witness the following, translated
from the cable columns of El Sub, Con-
cepcion, Chile (13/9/’27) :
Australia, Adelaide, September 12. —A radio mes-
sage broadcast throughout the country yesterday
announced that 30 powerful aeroplanes, prepared and
manned by enemies of Australia, had left some un-
specified base for the purpose of dropping bombs and
releasing asphyxiating gases over the main centres
of population, and that the invaders were already
approaching the city. The announcement caused the
greatest consternation. Crowds of citizens sought
shelter in caves and cellars, while others fled in all
directions, many of them in their abject terror
proclaiming that the destroyers were already in
sight. The rich and powerful families, in their
high-powered cars, abandoned the city in the utmost
precipitation and certain well-known dealers in
jewellery followed with their jewels and families
on a delivery truck.
The readers of El Sue, mostly Spanish-
Indian half-breeds, certainly get something
for their money.
* * * *
“Arradni”: The method of counting tele-
grams within the Commonwealth (B.
13/10/’27), which should be in operation
but isn’t, is that laid down by the, Inter-
national Telegraph Bureau, a body with its
headquarters at Berne and jnst now in con-
ference at Washington. All Governments
controlling cable and radio companies have
undertaken to adhere to its rulings; only
thus can chaos be avoided in international
signalling. The bureau stipulates, amongst
other things, that the station “TO” shall
be shown as appearing in column one of the
official nomenclature of international tele-
graph stations. If there is more than one
station of the same name (such as Mitcham,
Woodville, etc.) then the State or country
shall also be signalled as showm, but not
charged for. It is no concern of a sender
that there are three Richmonds, two Carl-
tons, two Brightons and two Manlys in the
Commonwealth, and he should not be charged
for State indicators, when necessary to
effect delivery. The Commonwealth’s hap-
hazard system of counting its inland tele-
grams, with little or no uniformity, has long
been an expensive joke.

ODE TO AN IMPORTED
NIGHTINGALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Two pairs of nightingales are being brought from
London to Maoriland, a gift from the novelist David
Garnett. It is proposed to send another half-dozen
to Australia to see if they can be acclimatised. The
donor expresses a fear that the birds, if homesick,
will find their way back, via India and Persia, to
their beloved Surrey woods.”
Songster of old-world passions, raptures,
pains!
And will you set the pommy, in slumber
sunk,
Who wandered years agone through Surrey
lanes,
Stirring uneasily upon his bunk
And vaguely speculating whether or not —
While your melodious notes his ears
caress,
Your jug-jug-jug in dim-remembered
keys—
He dreameth or is shot,
Dreams he is back at his old-time address
Or pays the penalty for beery sprees?
O for an aural draught of that serene
Lilt of the coppice! What wouldn’t it be
worth
To those who cannot simulate a keen
Joy in the kookaburra’s sunburnt mirth.
O for an earful of the glorious south
Of England’s prize exhibit on the screen
Of noise, in noisy daytime’s interim—-
Save west of Severn’s mouth,
For tuneful Taffy on his own domain
Will brook no bird that might compete
with him.
Come to us, Philomel, across the sea,
New worlds to conquer, pet of deathless
bards,
To fill our Hori with enraptured glee
And win Henare’s intimate regards.
The Thames-side dweller pays you homage
rare,
But when your burst of music swells ol-
dies
Amid the verdurous ferns around the
wliare,
Tribute as full and fair
As any Keats or Arnold could devise
You’ll earn in an ecstatical “Py Korri!”
Come and be climatised, immortal bird,
Shrinking and shy, in garb of sober brown.
From end to end of earth no risk s incurred
Of finding anything to pipe you down.
You’ll be as safe at Bendigo as Bath
Of adoration, and, when sick for home,
Tiring of Wanganui or of Lome,
Well, you can take the path
By way of lud in your own aerodrome
To leafy Leatlierhead or Sittingbourue.

Paid-up Capital, £ 1/22,100.
The Hotel of the Commonwealth, Sydney.
SUMMER DAYS IN SYDNEY.
ENCHANTING things to do and see on every hand
sight-seeing, social engagements, surfing. But
do not miss the pleasure of a stay at the “Hotel
Australia.” It is the hotel pre-eminent of unchallenged
excellence in cuisine, service and appointments.
Cable, Wireless and Telegraphic Address:
“Austraotcl, Sydney."
“C.Q.”: The counting-of-telegrams argu-
ment reminds that during the war the cen-
sors used to cut the names of steamers and
other matter supposed to have been of mili-
tary importance out of Diggers’ cables.
Then they had to put in something to make
the number of words correct. Each had his
fancy—“remembrances” or “lots of love”
were favorites. One day a fierce-faced woman
blew into a censor’s office. “I’m Bill Smith’s
stepmother, and I want to know what’s
come over Bill because his father’s going
crook,” she said. Then she smoothed out a
telegram. It read : “Mrs. Smith, arriving by
steamer million kisses, Bill!”

“Kelby”: Coming down from the Orient
on a 8.-P. boat I fraternised with an Oxford
COMFORTING.
“She’s so worried, poor girl . She tells me she can’t bring her
mind to a decision.”
“Good-oh. I’m glad there’s something about Muriel that isn’t
made up.”
professor, and found him pleasantly inter-
ested in our White Australia doctrine, and
quite ready to accept my assurances that it
had become a sort of religion with us. When
we drew into Darwin the hefty wharf-
laborers, all Aussies, impressed him im-
mensely. We went up the town and sought
a soft-drink place. It w r as Chinese. We
wanted to buy some picture postcards and a
Chink stationer accommodated us. Then
we lunched at a restaurant run by a dis-
colored Levantine. Later in the day we
went to a friend of mine for afternoon tea,
and the hostess explained that most of the
housework of Darwin was done by girls and
boys from the native camp outside the
town and the washing by Asiatics. The
subject of White Australia flagged a bit at
this stage, nor was it revived at Thursday
Island, where we called three days later.
Here the wharf-laborers presented a generous
mixture of whites, half-castes and islanders,
while the pearl depots were entirely in the
hands of Japanese and most of the shops
owned or run by them. It wasn’t till we
reached Townsville that I was able to look
the professor in the face again.

“Uramao” : The M.L. barmaid is liable to
lose her job these times unless she can show
a few crow’s-feet round her eyes or some
such evidences of
maturity. No Hebe
has been licensed
since 1920, so when
a constable’s eyes
lighted the other
day on an Auck-
land barmaid who
looked to be barely
out of her teens he
became embarrass-
ing 1 y inquisitive.
The young lady’s
temper soon gave
way under tin.
strain, and she
finally hurled her
barmaid’s certificate
at the inquisitor
and told him to do
what he darned
well liked with it.
The document
proved to be one
made out for an
elder sister who
had long since
dropped out of the
race. The incident
closed with a fine of £1 and a magisterial
forecast that the M.L. barmaid would soon
be as extinct as the moa.
* if * *
“The Listening-Insect” : It isn’t only Bol-
shevik propaganda that is liable to get
blanketed in the ether (B. 27/10/’27). My
next-door neighbor is a deeply religious man
and doesn’t believe in any brand of music
that isn’t sacred on Sundays, apparently.
At any rate, as soon as the evening service
is over his receiver gets out of step and his
subsequent efforts to stop his valves squeal-
ing occupy him —and the air—for the rest
of the programme.
* * if %:
“Mana”: The shoplifter who reaches
court may be a
lachrymose female
(B. 20/10/’27) ;
the adepts, I sus-
pect, are seldom
captured. There is
reason to believe
they work mostly
in pairs. A man
entered a big city
shop last Christ-
mastide and asked
to look at amber
necklaces; a few
seconds later a
woman arrived at
the same counter
to select a bead
bag. From my
coign in the back-
ground I saw the
man push three of
the necklaces along
the counter to his
neighbor, who
deftly covered
them with her coat
sleeve and slid them
into her bag. Then
she left ; her con-
federate, after toy-
ing with a few
more necklaces, de-
cided they were
not quite what he
wanted and fol-
lowed. It seemed a
very safe arrange-
ment. She was free
of suspicion, as she
had not looked at
necklaces, and he,
if caught and
searched, would
have none on him,
which would have
made things very
unpleasant for his accusers.
❖ ❖ # #
“Chancery-lane”: A novel excuse was
advanced by a Melbourne juryman the other
day for his disinclination to serve. “I was
fined some time ago for not having my
children vaccinated,” he explained, “conse-
quently I have a grudge aganst the Crown.
I do not feel that I could give a true verdict,
after having been in the dock myself.”
’ Son ah told the objector that he had a fine
opportunity to reconsider his attitude, and
drily added that his own previous experience
should render him of assistance to his fel-
low jurymen.
“Lob”: The long arm
again. J. Burke, of Moonee
Ponds (Vic.), after his arri-
val from England joined the
Big Brother movement and
was duly allotted a little
brother. The same on arrival
filled the specification
exactly; he was Burke's
younger brother.
WORSE SOMETIMES .
GRANNT : “I hope Willie doesn’t tell any naughty little lies.”
MOTHER: “No, I don’t think he does. But he tells some very embarrassing truths.”
“Tiny” : Touching these ancient locos (B.
20/10/’27) The old steam-tram engines
which N.S.W. imported from America nearly
50 years ago are still going strong and from
a standing start will show their tail to any
electric car. They may be seen in Newcastle
and parts of Sydney. Also Melbourne’s original
cable-trams are still on the tracks; 20 of
them imported from San. Francisco over -10
years ago are as good as ever. But I
don’t think many present-day Yankee pro-
ducts will be in going order in 1967.
* * si: , *
“A. Jack”: We are perpetually hearing
woman’s scarcity of clothing contrasted
favorably with man’s abundance of it, but
are Mrs. and Miss Littledress as immune
from pneumonia as doctors, among others,
assert? Underground workers, exposed to
changing temperatures and poor and dust-
laden air, are thought to be particularly sus-
ceptible to pneumonia, and surface men,
working in wet mills night and day, summer
and winter, carry about the same risk. Yet
the Broken Hill hospital’s experience of
pneumonia for last year was: Underground
workers, 16 cases; other mine employees, 22 ;
men other than mine employees, 18; women
and children, 53.
“P.M.”: The number 13 superstition (B.
20/10/’27) was nowhere stronger than in
the A.I.F. Flying Corps. The aeroplane
numbers used to run 12, 12A, 14, and the
pilots’ huts and tent numbers employed the
same evasion. I remember only one camp
where ordinary notation w r as employed. Even
here No. 13 was always reserved for
“Groundlarks” (non-flying officers). No
pilot would camp in it.
* * * *
“Mudros”: Mixed relationships (B.
13/10/’27). Near a northern town in S.
Aus. just before the war, a widower and
his four sons became enamored of the five
buxom daughters of a neighboring farmer.
In due course they all proposed and were
severally accepted; to dad fell the youngest
and fairest chicken in the nest. And now the
sons of the first marriage are half-brothers
to their own nephews.
* * * *
“Spare Archdeacon”: There is more talk
than ever about the miserable stipends paid
to clergy in Australia and elsewhere; the
other day the cableman came along with a
moving yarn about an Anglican prelate who,
knowing the rank and file of the clergy
whose hospitality he had to accept couldn’t
afford to entertain him, considerately left a
cheque under his serviette. lam encouraged
to hope these pinched conditions in country
parsonages are exaggerated by a story that
made a deep impression on me when I was
a boy. A bishop was travelling over his
diocese in the south-west of Ireland, then, as
now, one of the poorest sections of the dis-
tressful country. Knowing what a struggle
the minor clergy had to get along, he sent
special instructions ahead that no elaborate re-
ception was to be prepared in the dwellings of
the clergy which he visited. His disgust
may be pictured when he sat down to a meal
with a threadbare curate and his huge
family, and found the board graced by a
huge turbot which would have cost a
couple of guineas in London. His Lordship
signified his displeasure by sternly declining
to partake of the fish, and a woebegone
family saw it borne away. When it was
replaced by a dish of woodcocks worth their
weight in silver, the guest’s feelings over-
came him and he made some pointed re-
marks on sinful and ostentatious extrava-
gance. Not till he learned that both turbot
and woodcock were cheaper and more easily
come by in that isolated locality than red
herrings and chuck-steak did he realise that
he had spoken out of his turn.

“Carsbrook, Jun.”: The ball of lightning
which struck the Double Bay (N.S.W.)
public school, shattering the electric switch-
board to atoms and splintering the wireless
aerial, will doubtless revive the fears of
listeners-in that a wireless set in the home
will attract lightning. There is no danger
unless the aerial is not properly earthed
during a storm, in which case the lightning
will take the shortest path to earth. An
American radio magazine recently offered
5000 dollars to any reader who could prove
that his residence had been struck by light-
ning through the agency of an earthed aerial.
Only three claimed, and they were all proved
baseless ; in no case had lightning damaged
a house when the aerial was switched to
earth.

“Swede” : Being one of those “alien immi-
grants,” a category under which all
foreigners not of purely British stock are
lumped together by a certain class of news-
paper, I found it desirable to obtain a cer-
tificate that “alien is able to read and write
from dictation.” To that end I went to the
deputy Land Commissioner in Bundaberg
(Q.), who dictated a rather complicated
piece of legal verbiage, one sentence of which
contained 80 words. My writing, reading
and spelling all passed muster and I duly
received the certificate. On it I find that
the examiner has spelt the name of my
native country “Sweeden” !
* * *
“L.M.”: These popular week-end resorts
are responsible for some awkward situations.
While we were on our honeymoon the wife
got a note from her aunt, saying that she
had booked rooms for us at the Hotel Splen-
dide, close to her seaside residence, and
hoped to see us shortly. We couldn’t afford to
offend Auntie, so to the Hotel Splendide we
duly repaired, though I had my doubts whether
we should fit into its scheme. Sure enough,
as soon as we got downstairs for dinner, up
came Jackson, a friend of whom I had lost
track of late years, with “Hello, old chap!
When did you come down?” “Last night,”
I told him, adding, to acquaint him with my
new status, “Let me introduce you to my
wife.” The amused heartiness with which
he responded “What! You, too ! Come and
meet mine!” quite spoiled our dinner.
OWED TO SUMMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Fine to warm; rising temperatures.’’ —Daily
papers.
Summer’s coming, coming, coming!
Each mosquito gaily humming
Polishes, wee careful thing,
And makes sharp his little sting.
Sugar-ants, alert and wise,
Find out where the pantry lies ;
Soon will gather hordes of fleas
To disturb nocturnal ease.
Summer’s coming, bless and thank it!
Now the moths are in the blanket;
Singing frogs and cats that woo
Serenade us whole nights through.
Here is summer, summer, summer!
Hail the golden-robed newcomer
Whose long hours of steamy heat
Make us bury Sunday’s meat.
Summer’s sun with fiery rose
Paints full many a tender nose;
Summer’s rays in beauty dart
On the spilling garbage cart,
On burnt gardens brown and sad,
On the milk (which straight goes bad)
On the proudly soaring therm,
On the lurking ptomaine germ.
Summer opens every casement
From the attic to the basement,
Loosing, loud and strong and free,
\ r olumes of cacophony—
Pianos, wireless, gramophones,
Songs and sobs and wails and moans,
Each one in a different key:
Summer’s city symphony.
Governments deserving slaughter
Bation our supply of water,
Give us mockingly instead
Tar upon the pavements spread.
Butter’s oily; nothing’s nice,
For there’s seldom any ice,
Only bouncing blowflies drumming:
Summer’s coming, coming, coming!

The oil fire depicted above occurred
in Holland, and was extinguished in
1 j minutes with Firefoam. It is
typical of many conflagrations which
more and more frequently bring home
the fact that all fires are not alike, and
that apparatus which affords excellent
protection for one risk may be quite
useless for another.
The Foamite Method of Fire Pro-
tection is of proved efficiency, even in
the case of outbreaks involving the
most inflammable spirits; also quickly
and effectively smothers out any
ordinary fire.

Trade was brisker despite tight money dur-
ing the latter part of the term, and results
were the best since the postwvar boom.
The year’s net profit, which includes £18,083
put by as an insurance reserve, was 11.6 p.c.
on average capital, compared with 9.8, 9.4,
8.5, 9.4, 9.5, 9.4 and 14.7 p.c. back to 1920.
Over the same period divs. called for 79.1
p.c. of the total net earnings. Actually,
however, margins may have been greater.
In 1921, when most of Sydney’s retail
drapery houses suffered severely, Farmer
and Co. showed no visible weakness, and the
latest report says that the conservative
methods adopted in the valuation of stocks
in former years have not been departed
from.
Moreover, trading results have been better
than the ratio of profits to capital indicates;
the board’s bold policy of purchase, which
has made the co. owner of an entire end
of one of the most valuable blocks in
Sydney, has meant that a lot of money has
been unproductive. In 1920 freehold and
plant had a book value of £573,762 ; at July
31 last they were in at £955,313. To see
the George-Market streets section of the big
building programme to completion a half-
million 6 p.c. Ist mortgage debentures were
issued in May, at £96 10s., redeemable at
par, July 31, 1939. The underwriters took
half the issue and the public three times
over-subscribed the other half. At July 31
£420,080 of the money had come in, the dis-
count (£17,500) had been written off, and
brokerage and other exes, incidental to the
issues found no place in the sheet. Only
£3BBB went out in debenture interest, but
the current term’s earnings will be called
upon for somewhere about £30,000 under
that head, or, roughly, £7OOO less than was
sent to reserve last year, after the prefs.
had been attended to and 10 p.c. handed
to th e ords. No date for the completion of
the new premises is mentioned, but the co.
is using space as it becomes available.
How the debenture money and an addi-
tional £17,628 from trade creditors was used
is seen in this comparison of balance-sheet
figures:—
1914. 1924. 1926. 1927.

The trade debt was covered nearly three
times by stocks and book debts; and to meet
payments on account of the new bulding and
outlay on stock, there was £337,899 in cash
and investments and another £62,420 of
debenture money to come in. Stocks, of
course, will call for heavy additions when
the new show-rooms are opened. The
£135,000 labelled “bank drafts” is ominous
of substantial purchases pending in London.
Incidentally, the item also ’ reflects the
adverse trade balance inasmuch as drafts
and not bills are used.
Shares in other cos. are in at £11,506.
The co.’s holding in the Broadcasting Co. of
Australia Pty., Ltd. (3LO), which is a
dividend-payer, amounts to £34,000, and
there may be other interests as well. The
recent Royal Commission on Wireless found
that the co.’s own station (2FC) was
being operated at a loss, but that with the
removal of the studio to more suitable
premises and other improvements it should
rapidly becom e a profit earner.
The debenture debt is secured by a mort-
gage over the co.’s freeholds, valued at
£976,090. At July 31, 1926, freehold and
plant stood in the books at £695,573. Dis-
regarding the nice inner reserve there, and
after allowing for the debentures, the visible
cover for the Ist prefs. amounted to £6 per
share and for the 2nd prefs. £2 10s. per share
in net tangibles. Last year net profit was
almost three times their combined annual div.
requirements; the market prices the firsts at
19s. 6d. and the seconds at 20s. 9d., thus
returning the investor 6.1 p.c. and 6.8 p.c.
respectvely. For the ords., with net tang-
ible cover amounting to 30s. per share,
buyers offer 295. At that figure the return
is a shade under 7 p.c. as long as the 10 p.c.
div. continues, and there is no visible doubt
about that.

The co. is lucky to have a profit and not a
loss to show for last year. Shortly before
the close of the 1925 accounts £25,000
of new capital was issued and the money
went mostly into stocks, which were built
up in anticipation of a heavy demand from
the new subsidiary, Trufood Gelatine Iffy..
Ltd., formed to manufacture milk jelly, and
in which the Davis Gelatine Co. was also
interested. The new product failed to win
a market, and its manufacture was sus-
pended. That left the Trufood co. with a
great deal more milk powder in its store-
rooms than the board cared to see there.
The problem was how to get rid of it without
a loss. Output was restricted, prices were
cut, and by June 30, 1926, stocks had been
reduced £25,695. The net result is seen in
the figures in the table. With stocks still
heavy, the outlook at the beginning of the
last term was far from bright. However,
the sales department Avas reorganised, costs
were kept down and nature was kind. Turn-
over is largely affected by the seasons, and
conditions over most of Australia during the
year were dry; and although sales failed to
notch a record they got very close to it.
That enabled stock to be reduced a further
£21,610 to £29,874. All told the year’s
results wer e an expansion of £8428 in gross
profits (£32,387), and a cut of £1768 in
exes. (£14,373). Thus net profit benefited
to the extent of £10,196. That was after
£6264 of the year’s earnings had been struck
off for depreciation, £2600 put by for taxa-
tion, and £lOOO written off’ th e shares held
in the Trufood Gelatine Co. The £18,014
netted was 12 p.c. on average capital com-
pared with 5.2, 14.2 and 33.7 p.c. in the
three preceding years. Very handsome
returns considering that paid capital jumped
from £30.000 to £125.000 in the reconstruc-
tions of 1922 and 1923.
Balance-sheet movements over the last
three years have been :

Th e money from the liquidation of stocks
and a lot more was put into Government
securities (£40,000). With a more or less
liquid surplus of £82,088 the co. is well
positioned to meet contingencies. Ample
provision appears to have been made for
depreciation; and with stocks (they are in
at cost) now reduced to normal, the imme-
diate outlook is unclouded. On the market
sellers ask 245., but buyers stand off at 225.

The net profit claimed by the accounts is
£39,341, after providing for taxation, doubt-
ful debts, depreciation and all trading
charges; but £9406 has dropped from some-
where into “sundry reserves,” making them
£38,439. Part of the accumulation may be
specific reserves; still the lot is included —
with hesitation—in the table, and therefore
with profits. The £48,747 of profit thus
arrived at was 16.3 p.c. on paid capital com-
pared with 11.7 p.c., 6.1 p.c. and a loss back
to the time the co. started. After the prefs.
had been attended to the ords., which has-
tened to share in the year’s improvement,
were handed an interim 5 p.c. and a final
7-J p.c., making 12J p.c. for the year. That
left approximately one-third of last year’s
net earnings in the business and reduced the
amount of capital represented by intangibles
to a little more than half the £299,993 paid
up. Most of 'this has gone in getting the
Daily Guardian on to a profit-earning basis.
In its first 14 months it made a loss of
£101,378, including preliminary exes., but
£lOO,OOO of that was capitalised. For the
same period Smith’s Weekly made a profit
of £36,141 net. Since then the earnings of
the two papers have not been separated in
the published accounts, but if returns from
the weekly have held their own then the
Guardian, although it appears to have defi-
nitely turned the corner, cannot have brought
in a great deal.

Another adjacent property has been
bought since the close of the accounts, and
the co. has sold the goodwill of Smith’s
Weekly in Victoria, S. Australia, West-
ralia and Tasmania to a subsidiary co. for
100,000 fully-paid £1 ords. The public was
offered 150,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs.—-all under-
written—in this co., and Smith’s News-
papers, Ltd., guaranteed the 8 p.c. subject
to the rights of holders of its own prefs.
There are 150,000 of these, 9 p.c. cumu-
latives, and last year’s net profit was 3J
times their annual requirements; but the
net tangible backing amounted to only
19s. lid. per share. The market, however,
is satisfied with prospects and pays 225. 3d.
for the scrip. The ords. are all held by
.Toynton Smith and his associates.

The extraordinary expansion of the figures
over the past decade reflects the rapid
growth _of Brisbane and its suburbs. The
prosperity has been both real and artificial.
Queensland’s clips and crops, as a whole,
have been good, but the Government has
been a vigorous spender of borrowed money,
and between the two the demand by workers
for homes of their own has been well sus-
tained. Hence the Federal has had a busy
time.
The co. is a reconstruction of the old
Federal Building, Land and Investment
Society, which had so strenuously written
down its assets that it was able, when the
tide turned, to win rapidly increasing pro-
fits and so attract new capital. Since 19.18
par issues have added £241,596 to paid capi-
tal, shareholders have had a regular 12 p.c.
and reserves have not had to be starved to
do it, although the rapidly growing capital
is diminishing the relative reserved strength.
Last year £80,495 of new capital came in.
Shortly before the close of the accounts the
board took a long look ahead and offered
a quarter-million new £1 shares, one for
one. Except for a handful held pending
the decision of oversea members, the whole
issue was quickly snapped up. Only 2s. 6d.
per share has been asked for; the balance
(17s. 6d.) will, be got! in as expansion of the
business calls for money. Which means, of
course, that investors cannot look for any
benefits by way of new issues for some
time, though they may benefit by the call-
ing up of some or all of the 17s. 6d.
Earning power, of course, has been affected
by the steady inflow of new capital, but
it is still robust. The £34,161 netted last
year was 16.8 p.c. on average capital com-
pared with 1.8, 21.2, 20.7 and 21.5 p.c. back
to 1923. Average funds (capital and re-
serves) earned 12.7 p.c. during the year;
on the figures at the close of the accounts
a return of 9.5 p.c. would be sufficient to
meet a 12 p.c. distribution.
How the co. uses its own and depositors'
money is seen in this comparison:—

Capital .. £52,725 £74,328 £190,860 £271,355

Cash, etc. . . 69,195 109,321 181,782 220,309
The new capital and more went out in
advances (£838,503, up £121,423) ; and the
large cash holding suggests an early exten-
sion of lending. At September 30, for every
£1 of its own funds the co. was holding
£2 14s. lid. of the public’s money compared
with £3 10s. 9d. a year ago, and Bs. 9d.
of every £1 of debt was liquid. The market
looks at the fine earning power, and, satis-
fied that last year’s div. can be maintained,
pays 30s. 6d. for the fully-paid £1 shares.
At that figure the return is a shade under
S p.c. on a 12 p.c. distribution, and the back-
ing is 255. 2d. in net tangibles.

There is, however, some hidden strength in
freeholds —probably a good deal, in fact,
because the co.’s chief holding, in York-
street, Sydney, has been greatly increased
in value by the Harbor Bridge, which will
empty passengers from the north side into
Wynyard-square, near by. Last year the co.
sold portion of this freehold at a price which
was not disclosed. A year ago the property
stood in the books at £48,552, compared with
£30,000 at the close of last accounts. It
is certain that the portion sold brought in
a great deal more than £18,552, the differ-
ence between the two figures. Obviously the
board has written up the unsold portion of
the property; but even then the asset is
greatly undervalued. At the same time the
operation has allowed the co. to build up its
strength elsewhere, without inflating the
trading profits. As far as one can judge, in-
deed, none of the profit from the sale has
gone into the P. arid L. account.
Here are balance-sheet movements: —

Cash, investments,
etc 23,203 42,545 45,622 37,165
Of the £88,770 of debt £20,000 is on mort-
gage and the balance owing to the bank
(£9290) and trade creditors (£59,486). The
more or less liquid surplus (£124,970),
including stocks (£100.219, up £11,110),
improved £3580. A freehold was bought in
Melbourne and a seven-storeyed building is
to be put up thereon. The item stood in the
books at £16,565 on July 31 and the figure
will, of course, grow as the work progresses.
Jewellery is not as fashionable nowadays
as it was a dozen years and more back. Com-
petition, even at the wholesale end of the
trade, is very keen, but Arthur Cocks and
Co. has been able to build up a big optical
business (the line on which the founders of
the company grew up), and this has been a
steady contributor to profits. On the mar-
ket sellers ask 21s. 6d. for the ords.; buyers
offer 20s. 6d. At the middle price the return
to the investor is 9-§ p.c. on a 10 p.c. div.
basis, and the security amounts to 225. 2d.
in net tangibles. The well-protected prefs.
are closely held.

Newspaper Fusion.—Following the pur-
chase of the Morning Post in Melbourne by
the Herald Co., which will amalgamate it
with the Sun-Pictorial, the Sun Co., of
Sydney, has come at last to an arrangement
with the Daily Telegraph Co.
Two new cos. will be formed. One will
be a working co. In this co. the present
Telegraph Co. will be allotted shares; each
Telegraph share will receive 6s. in its
pref. capital and 6s. 6d. in its ordinary
capital. That will mean altogether £222,225;
the balance of the capital—unspecified—will
be provided by the Sun Co. The money
received from the sale of the King-street
property and other available assets will be
distributed in cash —something between 16s.
and 17s. 6d. is expected. The present co.
will be wound up, and the shares in the work-
ing co. will be held by a new Telegraph

Co., which will consist of the shareholders
in the present co. The capitalisation of that
co. has not yet been decided upon. Nor has
the capital of the working co. been announ-
ced. If. how T ever, the Sun takes ordinary
capital equal to the ordinary capital to be
allotted to the Telegraph, the total capital
of the co. will be £337,782 —£106,668 of
pref. and £115,557 of ord. capital to the
Telegraph and £115,557 of ord. capital held

may not be required, but an unspecified
amount of capital is to go to the Sun for
goodwill—for the use of its organisation, the
benefit of its prestige and its undertaking to
keep out of the field. These things will
pi’obably be valued rather so it is
most likely that more than £115,557 will
be allotted to the Sun. Even as late as
1920 the Daily Telegraph showed
£66,938 profit: for the five years 1920-24
inclusive the average was over £33,000; and
during part of that period it was in a bad
way. With the sort of vigorous management
it is likely now to have, a profit of over
£30,000 a year ought to be easy. The
Sun can make more than five times that
much.

During the past week hundreds of gallons
of oil and water emulsion have discharged at
the Roma Corporation No. 1 bore, accom-
panied by as much as 5 p.c. free oil at times.
Most of the emulsion is water, but fair
quantities of oil have been recovered on
settling. R.O.C. shares made most of their
rise on this news, as the belief was popu-
larly held that this might be the prelude to
a discharge of crude oil. This view is not
held by the scientific personnel who are
engaged in watching operations. By them
it is not considered promising for a discharge
of crude oil that the oil so far discharged is a
light-colored motor spirit which can be used
at once without treatment. Most of the oil
is almost water-clear, with a strong kerosene
odor. All agree that it is a light condensate
and may have travelled some distance, and
there is a pretty general agreement
among the scientists —though the tech-
nical men are not so sure about it -
that crude oil is not very likely to flow from
No. 1. Brine has also been recovered; and
while this is favorable for the field’s ulti-
mate prospects, it cannot be construed in
the same sense for the bore, as. it may indi-
cate bottom water there. While it is con-
sidered a distant possibility that considerable
gas movement may draw in crude oil to the
bore, it is not an expectation for share-
holders to be sanguine about. The net result
of No. 1 seems to be that the presence of
crude oil in commercial quantity is indi-
cated with reasonable certainty in the struc-
ture. But the real search for crude oil starts
with Nos. 2 and 3 bores, in which it is
hoped to strike the petroliferous sand lower
down the dome. Geological research has
indicated the existence of a dome. The future
is full of hope, but the share market will
probably recede while the extra holes are
being sunk, except in the event of some
unlooked-for favorable development at No. 1,
;t; * * *
From an old Bulletin man at Roma: —
After my 20 years’ search for an oil-well in Aus-
tralia it was delightful to run up to Roma from
Melbourne, 1043 miles, and rub my hands in a
kerosene-tin full of real Australian petroleum. It
is 20 years since I published a pamphlet with the
defiant title “Petroleum Does Exist in Australia,”
written as a result of personal observation in U.S.A.,
Burma and Dutch East Indies, where oil is mined.
One seemed almost entitled to claim that Austialia
contained petroleum because it possessed every other
metal and mineral. And the vastness of this coun-
try was a strong reason why it ought to have oil
concealed somewhere.
The geologists, generally official, were against oil
being found, because, they said, if it did exist,
it should have been found in water-wells and bores
regardless of the fact that to get a flow of
oil from a bore you must shut out water;
and the foreign-traders in petroleum products, who
professed to be experts in oil, naturally did not want
to see it produced here. However, neither the geo-
logists nor the oil merchants who import over 10
millions pounds’ worth of oil products a year can
prevent oil being produced. We stand at the open
door of a new epoch in the wonderful history of
this country.
The Roma Oil Corporation well “brought in”
natural or petroliferous gas from 3702 ft., and shortly
after oil began to drip at the casing-head and
steadily increased in volume. It is a light-colored,
high-gravity oil of paraffin base, containing 91 p.c.
of spirit. So pure is the oil that it can be poured
from the bore pipes into a motor-car and used with-
out any refining. This looks like a record for the
world. A parade of cars through the streets of
Roma driven with crude oil from the well is surely
one of the most remarkable incidents in the Conti-
nent’s history.
Natural gas has been known to exist at Roma —•
it was found in 1900 —and from one bore it escaped
for 4i years—without being used! Natural gas
largely takes the place of coal gas in Canada and
the United States; about £80,000,000 is consumed
yearly for lighting, power and heating in the States
alone. I have seen it piped for 200 miles in Canada,
supplying towns along the route with the best, clean-
est and cheapest substance for giving heat, light
and power. In the United States it is claimed 2s.
worth of natural gas will do exactly the same work
as 10s. worth of electric juice.
Thus far 750,000 acres have been pegged for
permits, which are prospecting licenses, or, roughly,
1107 square miles. Most of the blocks pegged are
for 10,000 acres. The pegging is from Roma
towards Longreach.
To W. E. Cameron, ex-State Geologist of Queens-
land, and to Dr. H. I. Jensen, the thanks of the
Australian people are due for their tenacity of faith
that oil did exist in Queensland. Two other men
who deserve haloes or crowns are the American
drillers, Clarence Evans and Jack Machado.
The Petroleum Act of Queensland 1923 is a feeble
attempt to nationalise oil, and the result has been
to make it difficult to comply with the regulations.
Shepherding has been created on a large scale, for
a permit good for a year is followed by two years
in which the permittee may drill if he chooses. It
is a monstrous stupidity and ought to be repealed.
The Minister of Mines must pass the prospectus, and
transfer or assignment of the permit or lease is
practically impossible. An amending Act is pro-
mised and many silly restrictions ought to be
removed. In attempting to make petroleum min-
ing 100 p.c. pure it is possible to kill it.
* * * *
“Wild Cat” (B. 27/10/’27) on
Roma says that Professor Steele ought to
be listened to because he is the first man
of scientific eminence to assert that oil in
payable quantities would almost certainly
be found in the Maranoa basin thereabouts.
Professor Steele didn’t say that till he saw
oil flowing at Roma. W. B. Cameron, then
one of the Government geologists of Queens-
land, wrote in 1904: “The probabilities of
oil in the beds below the neighborhood of
Roma are considerable.” A year or so later
he said: “There is no geological reason
why oil in large quantities should not be
found in the Roma district.” In 1920 Dr.
H. I. Jensen wrote :
It is obvious that, geologically speaking, Queens-
land bears the same relation to the Pacific Ocean
as does the U.S.A. What has delayed the discovery
of oil in Australia for so many years is, in my
opinion, not the absence of oil, but the absence of
oilseeps of such unmistakable character as to strike
the eye of the average bushworker. But, to the
geologist, an abundance of oilseeps is, after all,
merely evidence that the area in which they occur
is an oilfield near or approaching its end. They
are most abundant in highly folded and faulted oil
areas, where the oil has ample avenues of escape....
The great basin in Queensland, in which I believe oil
will be found, is a sealed basin.... It has been shown
that Queensland possesses rocks of the right litho-
logical nature and folded in the right manner to
yield oilfields of great magnitude.
And the work of Lionel Ball, Government
geologist, who has been petroleum adviser
and observer for the Government for the last
two years, cannot be forgotten. His patience,
thoroughness and carefulness are fine things
in this history of prospecting for oil.

“Old Warden”: What may be styled the
first authoritative report on the Bulolo and
Edie Creek, in New Guinea, has just been
handed in to the Federal authorities by J. D.
McLean, the Queensland gold warden who
was borrowed by the N.G. Administration to
straighten things out on the field. In his
opinion the alluvial ground, though £300,000
worth of gold has been taken out of it, has
hardly yet been scratched. The inaccessibility
of the fields still remains their worst draw-
back, though a steadily increasing ’plane
service is proving of immense benefit to the
men on the claims, even if only compara-
tively light loads can be carried. Larger
’planes, capable of carrying up to a ton and
over, -were being sought, and with the arrival
of these it would be possible to carry parts
for small batteries to the field and immensely
facilitate methods of working, as well as
increase output rates. With this possibility
in view, there is particular interest in the
Warden’s report on the line of reef recently
discovered in Merri Creek, a tributary of the
Edie, and a locality which was earlier worked
as alluvial ground. The line, 30 feet wide
and running across the creek, had been un-
covered for some distance and the outcrop
traced for five miles. No underground work
had yet been done, but from careful sampling
and estimates by himself, the Warden con-
sidered the stone, showing gold freely, would
crush 20oz. to the ton as far as the surface
examination showed. What will happen
when depth is reached and the sulphides
come in will have to be left to the future
to determine. Gold values were only £2 10s.
an ounce, but in the Warden’s opinion the
reef is the most promising thing of its kind
struck on this side of the world since the
big Westralian shows. That being so —and
there is no reason to doubt it—the sooner the
Federal Government gets busy on making a
practicable transport road to the field the
better. There never were mountains yet that
a good engineer could not conquer, and if
the cost is likely to be heavy, there seems
reason to suppose that the gold to meet it is
at the far end.
* * * *
New Guinea Gold and Osmiridium, which
went to London to offer its areas on the
Bulolo fields, reports that an English co. has
taken over most of the original syndicate s
interests in the New Guinea mountains. This
New Guinea Goldfields Exploration, the new
concern, has a capital of £(5,000 in 300,000
shares of ss. each. Of these, 90,000 f.p.
shares are to be issued to the original holders
on transfer of the properties. Shareholders in
the original co. will receive one ss. share in
the English eo. for each 2s. 6d. share at pre-
sent held. This will leave a balance of 10,000
f.p. shares, which are to be sold “to provide
sufficient capital to enable the co. to carry on
further prospecting operations.” Promoters
and underwriters take 50,000 f.p. shares, the
remaining 150,000 being contributing shares
for working capital, of which 25,000 have
been subscribed to date in London, and
25,000 underwritten. As to the mine or its
prospects, nothing seems to have been said,
but this is not unusual with the promoters,
who have consistently moved in a mysterious
way their wonders to perform.
* * * *
“M.E.”: Cables from London have been
suggesting that a move to control the price
of tin is taking shape—that American and
Dutch producers, as well as British, are
getting together with some such idea. It is
actually stated that the price is to be
stabilised at £3OO, which is something lik<-
skinning your bear before you catch him.
The British Empire produces about GO p.c.
of the world’s tin, mostly from Malaya and
Nigeria. America is supposed to garner 25
p.c., mostly from South American properties,
while the Dutch Indies produce most of the
balance. It is reasoned by the supporters of
the scheme that if these interests coalesce to
fix prices, the thing is as good as done. They
overlook the consumer. You may lead a con-
sumer to the market, but you can’t make him
buy at a price that will not show him a
profit. There are two great uses for tin.
One is in the vast canning industry, the
other in the motor trade. Both could pro-
bably find substitutes for tin to a very great
extent; and with keen competition in their
fields they would certainly try hard. What
can happen in a case of that sort the history
of the copper rig of nearly 40 years ago
showed ; it took a dozen years for the French-
men to unload their surplus. The F.M.b.
tried the same thing with tin five years ago.
The metal was dropping heavily and the
authorities —the Government in tnis case
set out to stabilise the market. The price
was fixed at £230. They soon found them-
selves loaded up with oyer 20,000 tons of
tin, and then had to realise, with the result
that in March, 1922, the price was down to
£139. Doled out at 800 tons per month, it
took over two years to dispose of. Even if, by
some miracle, price fixation was accom-
plished, the placing of the minimum at
£3OO would meet with fierce* opposition.
The world can be supplied at much less
and the suppliers make a profit. I his does
not mean that with tin at £262 10s. -last
week-end quotation-—the high values which
speculators have been asking for the aver-
age share issued at £1 are anything like
justified, which probably explains why some
people are so anxious to bring this pool oft.
Others will be satisfied if they can make a
lot of people believe that it is likely to be
brought off. * * *
Many new prospects are being opened
up on the old tin-bearing areas in the Cairns
hinterland (N.Q.). One has been located
at Irvinebank. Known as the. Rebound, its
two discoverers had been working on it for
three weeks before it was reported, and had
opened out a hole 20ft. by 30ft. without locat-
ing the walls of the lode, though they had
40 tons of ore at grass, valued at £bOU. Ifte
ore assays 20 p.c., and is easily worked.
* * * *
Considerable scout boring is being done
on the Root’s Creek sluicing area of GO acres
at the head or Mosman River and 20 miles
from Mt. Carbine (N.Q.). Dr. Jensen is in
charge of the work, and results to date are
tersely stated to be quite satisfactory. Alto-
gether 75 scout bores are proposed, and when
these are completed the plant is to be moved
to the Mitchell River and Rifle Creek, where
claims totalling 1500 acres have been pegged
out. These areas are suitable for hydraulic
sluicing, as they consist of practically boul-
derless alluvial and soft granite detritus. The
water supply is reported O.K.

The re-opening of the Blue Peter, at the
Broughton field, Charters Towers, will recall
old memories to many northern miners. The
Broughton in former days was a field unto
itself, possessing two batteries and producing
much rich stone. Blue Peter, Blucher’s Vic-
tory and Hibernia were among the leaders.
The first of these shows has been unwatered
anu sampled, in tfte 3ft. formation tftere is
a heavy mineralised reef varying from Bin.
to Ift. thick assaying from 2oz. to 7oz.
Mines-inspector Laun’s report was good
enough to induce the Mines Department to
put up £3OO toward the purchase of mach-
inery to supplement £3OO put up by the
syndicate.

Perth speculators are growling about the
Westralian stamp duties. At present the
imposition is ss. for every £2o consideration
money as against 6d. for every £5O m S.A.,
6d. for every £lO in Queensland, 9d. tor
every £lO in N.S.Wi and nil in Victoria.
Perth brokers, when offering shares of cos.
which have a Westralian register, are fre-
quently advised that such shares are not
wanted. The result is that shares are trans-
ferred, from the Westralian to Eastern
States’ registers, and another State receives
stamp duty while Westralia gets nothing. No
co. has a share register in the West if it
can be avoided.
* * * *
A new issue of Wiluna (W.A.) shares
will probably be made before the end of
the year and perhaps another £200,000 added
to the co.’s subscribed capital by this means.
A small Lodge-iCotterell treatment plant is
being installed on the mine, and if it gives
the expected extraction its enlargement will
quickly follow. So far no effort has been
made to float a co. to acquire leases sur-
rounding the Wiluna, but a move is expected
shortly.

“Peter” : Ivurrawang Wood Co., on which
the mining cos. on the Kalgoorlie-Boulder belt
rely for fuel, may increase the price of its
product once too often. The latest rise is
2s. 6d. per ton, At least one co. has been
experimenting with Collie coal, and has
shown that another 2s. 6d. rise in the
price of wopd will probably cause those
cos. on the field which are not bound in
some way to the Kurrawang Co. to use coal
instead of wood fuel.
* * * *
Mutooroo Co. is hanging on to the Wara-
tah option (W.A.) in the belief that it has
a chance at depth, but has rejected all other
properties submitted to it. Latest figures
show that losses on various prospecting!
accounts have swollen the profit and loss
debit to £88,709. On August 31 last the co.
had £6500 on deposit.

“Ex-Dig.” : I happened to be on the other
?ide of the door when Tommy Dodds, then
in charge of London A.I.F. H.Q., exploded
after listening to a complaint from the War
Office about the failure of Australian soldiers
to salute. “Why in hell's name should real
soldiers spend their leave saluting the
blanked popin-jays who have never heard
anything more like a blanked shot than the
blanked popping of a champagne cork?” was
merely the beginning of the explosion.
Dodds hated the office soldier almost as much
as he hated the politician.
The two Clarkes, Frank and Russell, now
in Yic. House of Landlords, can boast of a
grandad and a dad who were in that House
before them, and Everard, M.L-A., is the son
of John, who was in that chamber nearly 70
years ago. But Maurice Blackburn can go
back even further. He is grandson of Alex-
ander McCrae, who was P.M.G. from July
15, 1851, to November 28, 1855 —before re-
sponsible government.
E. A. Brown, a Sydney man. claims lo
have covered 5600 miles on walking tours,
mostly during his holidays. With high wages
and cheap motors walking tours have lost
their popularity, but it was quite a usual
pastime in the old days, One-time N.S.W .
astronomer Clement Wragge was a keen
pedestrian. He would don old clothes, fix
his swag, and take a train out to some
spot on the verge of explorable country and
lose himself for a few w r eeks. N.S.W. State
member Tom Mutch was once leader of a
touring club which took train each week-
end to the mountains and set off on explora-
tions.
Jones, Yic. Minister for Works, is the
most travelled member of the Labor Govern-
ment. He has made several trips to Europe
at his own expense, and has studied more
than casually much of what he saw while on
tiie wing. He first became a Minister in
1913 under Elmslie. ' Although he runs a
big city clothing establishment and a sheep-
farm at Benalla, politics have for long been
much more than a side-line with him. He is
emphatic against departmental waste, and
is as keen on making a good bargain for
the State as he is in liis private business.
Grazier Peter S. Mitchell tied up his
estate with unusual conditions. Mitchell
died childless. After making a life provision
for his widow he devised that the whole of
his wealth should be devoted to promoting
physical perfection in Australia by giving
scholarships and rewards for physical culture,
and athletic prowess. His Bringenbrong
estate, at Albury (N.S.W.), was put up for
auction the other day; but the trustees
reckoned that £143.710 was too little for the
23,282 acres, and the property was passed in.
George Carey, who knew the Goulburn
(N.S.W.) district by inches, died the other
day within a few miles of where he was
born 88 years previously. Seventy years
ago he delivered wool in George-street,
Sydney, unyoked his team in the Haymarket
and turned his bullocks to graze in Surry
Hills. To-day, apart from the park-lands,
the whole of the area is densely covered wifli
houses and factories. And far out on the
Liverpool-road, where the agents used to
meet the teams in the bush and buy the load,
suburbs now crowd on other suburbs.

In the midst of a close conversation with
the Mayor and Town Clerk of Prahran one
day he sprung on to a chair, peered over a
partition which separated the little group
from an adjacent class, hurled a book at
the head of a talkative pupil, and then,
without comment, resumed his conversation,
On another occasion, after a half-hour’s lec-
ture to the English class on the fundamental
differences between Ruskin and Macaulay,
he strode across to another class and scrib-
bled a sentence on the board for them to
parse: “John fell into the pond and wet his
pants.”
“J.M.IL”: The material for Richard
Delian’s latest book was supplied by her
brother. I met him in Broome, where he
was known as “Colonel” Graves —an old
man, growing decrepit, with a leering, genial,
pock-marked face. None knew his Christian
name. He and I were both shell-openers
working on the pearling fleet. Graves had
been an adventurer since his early manhood.
There was scarce a war fought since 1875
in which he had not played a part. Plain
nature never satisfied the Colonel. He had
to embellish —his wars were fiercer, his people
stranger, his escapes narrower, his experien-
ces more enthralling. One disbelieved but sat
and listened —he talked so well. But he could
not write. The things that his lips made
vivid, his pen obscured. The “Colonel” had
sent his sister material from Africa. She
had wmven it into “The Dop Doctor.” He
came to Perth at the end of the pearling
season of 1924, and died in the Old Men’s
Home.
John Salmond is a Scot by birth, though
the son of a Dunedin law professor. He

of lecturing and went into the Law Drafting

Office. He became Solicitor-General in
tln-ee years and has been a Judge since 1920.
He represented the Shivery Isles at the
Washington Conference, has written vari-
ous heavy tomes on torts, jurisprudence and
legal history, and is supposed to know more
about the Fernland Constitution than any-
one else. His Washington trip earned him
a knighthood. His manner on the Bench is
particularly suave, and counsel like him,
though they daren’t try to pull his leg.
Memories of the Ivalgoorlie gold rush were
revived in Melb. Supreme Court when a
cousin of the late Patrick Hannan, one of
the discoverers of the famous field, got an
order for £364 against his executor for keep-
ing house for Hannan and nursing him dur-
ing the last four years of his life. Hannan,
who was 80 when he passed on in 1925, had
been in receipt of a pension of £3 per week
from the Westralian Government, in recog-
nition of his part in the discovery of the
field.

Federal Senate. Now he fills in time assist-
ing to manage the Alfred Hospital, steadying
the National Union in case it should collar
too many Labor planks, and keeping the
breaks on fellow trustees lest the Argus
should become too radical.
The death of J. G. S. Purvis left Sydney
Water and Sewerage Board with two places
to fill: chief and assistant-chief engineer.
Purvis succeeded to his job only a few
months ago. Before his death the board
had offered a salary of £l5OO for a deputy
engineer, but the bait was not tempting
enough. President Cooper, authorised to
make a search, nominated Gerald Haskins,
second in command of the engineering section
of the Works Department. After the chief's
death the recommendation was altered
to give the new man the senior job at £l7OO.
Plaskins is a Maorilander. He has been 16
years with the N.S.W. Works Department,
and has been responsible for some of its
biggest jobs, including the Avon dam and the
Ilume reservoir.
Hogan, Vic. Premier, isn’t credited with a
keen sense of humor, but his lips twitched
the other afternoon when a deputation from
the Master Butchers’ Association w r as intro-
duced by its president—A. Lamb.
Maoriland’s last-but-one Priminister, the
late Bill Massey, is to have the most
imposing tomb in the Shivery Isles. He was
buried in a gunpit at Point Halswell, one
of the most picturesque headlands in Wel-
lington Harbor, and a huge white marble
affair is to be erected on the spot. The
shades of Grey, Ballance and Seddon will
smile sardonically, perhaps, though they
would concede that Massey had many admir-
able qualities. But lie wasn’t a statesman
like Grey, a brilliant reformer like Ballance,
or even such a skilful and masterful poli-
tician as Seddon.
Alfred Jarvis, just dead at Wabba (Vic.),
was the first man to drive a mob of cattle
from Adelaide to Sydney. Jarvis was one
of the pioneers of the Murray River district.
He spent all but a couple of his 94 years
in Australia.
There was wild cheering when Schwarz-
bard, a Russian Jew r who shot dead the Cos-
sack General Simon Petlura, was acquitted
by a Paris Court after a week’s trial rival-
ling in interest the Dreyfus case. Violent
pogroms occurred a few 7 years ago in
the Ukraine, and resulted in the destruction
of half a million Jew 7 s —men murdered,
women ravished and babies spitted on
pikes. Petlura’s own soldiers and officials
took part in the excesses. Large funds were
raised by such societies as the Friends
of Humanity, as well as the Jews throughout
the world, for Schwarzbard’s defence.
Municipal councillors are fewer in Vic.
Parliament than they were some years ago.
There are seven, including Ministers Beckett
and Williams, in the Uppah Chambali. and
eight in the Assembly. As one of the 99
units of the State Parliament a member
may, perhaps, be assessed as somebody, but
as one of 2000-odd who make up the 200
municipal councils in the Cabbage State he
can hardly claim to be anybody, no matter
how 7 many feathers he wears in his hat.
Oscar Tliorwald Johann Alpers, Maoriland
writer and only foreign-born British Judge,
had to surrender some months ago to an
old complaint. But his temporary retire-
ment has been active enough: he has been
writing a volume, “Myself, by One Who
Knows Him,” which he intends to publish
posthumously. Those others who know him
w 7 ell hope that he will alter his decision and
give the public an early chance to read the
story of the 12-year-old Danish boy who,
landing in Napier, ignorant of the language
of which he now is master, became an enter-
tainer, scholar, teacher, advocate and Judge
of a people strangers to his fathers.
In John Good Australia has a new 7 citizen
w 7 lio may some day prove very useful. Good
was director of a British national pro-
jectile factory during the w 7 ar, and is one of
the world's authorities on gun-sights. But
his business in Australia has a peaceful
basis; he is representing a British motor
firm.
L. S. AMERY, Dominions Secretary, now
in Australia on his tour of the outer
suburbs of the Empire.
Professor Schaffer, of yienna, one of
Europe’s best-known geologists, is at pre-
sent in Sydney gathering material for the third
volume of his book on diastrophism. Although
not definitely announced it is presumed that
he will have a few breezy remarks to make
on epeirogeny and orogeny.
IN AMBI-LAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Mr. Bernard Shaw describes the reply of the
Archbishop of-Canterbury to the Bishop of Birming-
ham in the present religious controversy as ‘a heart-
felt appeal for ambiguity.’ ”
’Tis white, some folk are positive, as snow ;
’Tis black as ink, perversely others say.
Assertive l’es is met with downright No.
But isn’t there a via media? May
It not in actuality be gray?
Bethink you, we need never disagree
But for the foolish urge to rend away
The pleasant veil of ambiguity.
How hard a row had Pythia’s been to hoe,
How quite impossible her part to play,
That Delphic bird to whom the Greeks would
go
For tips to back and cryptic words to
weigh.
If there’d been straight-out answers to
convey,
Not cross-word puzzles of those years b.c.
Dash it! Could she have kept her job a
day . .
Without recourse to ambiguity ?
Turf tipsters paste it in their smooth
chapeaux
Lest they should go more frequently astray.
AVell does the weather prophet knojv it. So
Do geologic pundits who assay
Prospects of mines from Cobar to Cathay.
The massive scholar’s seldom from it free.
And what do politicians owe it, eh?
The blessedness of ambiguity !
It lies ’twixt Is and Isn’t—Yea and Nay—
Or anywhere ’tween Rome and Tennessee,
A spacious land as one would wish survey,
The neutral zone of ambiguity.

IF you are an average citizen, who likes a taste occasionally, will you
not admit that your eye—rather than your palate—often is the judge
of whisky quality?
Pour a nobbier from an unlabelled bottle or from a friend’s decanter,
and can you tell what brand of whisky you are drinking?
If you cannot, you’ll agree that prejudice has been replacing judgment.
Prejudice has for long been the enemy of OLD COURT —the Aus-
tralian whisky, and has kept many a man from sampling it.
Nevertheless, It has been proved to be the World’s purest. The £lOOO
challenge issued six months ago on behalf of OLD COURT WHISKY
has never been accepted.
Let the test of taste replace the prejudiced view —
Try OLD COURT WHISKY iust once.

DAVID’S GENTLE HINT.
COW COCKIE (3 a.m.): “Are yer asleep, Dave?”
DAVE: “No, not yet.”
“The Rumpus” : Visiting an apiary in the
sou'-west of Jarrahland, I thought the owner
unnecessarily cruel to squash out the lives
of two innocent-looking green frogs. “Every
damned croaker I find round my hives is put
out of action,” he said. “God knows how
many bees they scoff every day, but I know
whole colonies can be cleaned out in a week
if not closely watched. The frogs take up
positions near tin 1 , entrance and just snap
up the bees as they pass in or out. A bee
can’t or won’t sting a frog.”
"Biliai” : The crocodile mentioned as swat-
ting a swimming dog with its tail (B.
22/9/'27) before seizing it in its jaws must
have been C. johnstoni. This chap, the
Australian variety, grows to a maximum
length of about 16ft. and has a long slender
conical snout. Had he been of the Papuan
kind, C. porosus, there would have been but
one snap of the mighty jaws and exit dog.
The latter species is much fiercer than the
Australian, and grows to an enormous size.
It has no preference with regard to the
waters in which it lives; fresh, salt and
brackish are one to it, and when times are
hard and the water-larder is bare it goes
hunting on land. There was a croc, head in
a ravi at Ivoriki so monstrous that I had
the natives mark out for me where head and
tail were when the brute lay dead, and the
d.stance taped 41 feet. Another, which
slithered quietly into the waters of the Ufafa
River, not 20 yards from me, was half as
long again as the 30ft. whaleboat in which
1 was travelling.
“Echoe”: There is no special Aussie
variety of crocodile. Australian crocs, are
the same in size, shape and all other re-
spects as those inhabiting India and Africa.
That 9ft. 3in croc, which “Anaf” (B.
22/9/’27) saw shot outside Cooktown must
have been a young one. Perhaps “Anaf” is
confusing the croc, with the gavial, a large
lizard which grows to about Sft. or 9ft. in
length, and slightly resembles the croco-
dile. It is quite harmless. The gavial is only
found well inland, and is sometimes errone-
ously called the “freshwater crocodile.”
“CSC”: According to “E.S.” (B.
29/9/’27) “a 13ft. alligator has yet to be
found.” There is what everyone believes
to be an alligator 25ft. long in the tidal
Raglan Creek (Q.) ; there is also a croco-
dile with a longitude of 30ft. or there-
abouts. The former is blunt-nosed and
spiky-looking; the latter is long-nosed, with a
clean hide. They are both shy of a
boat, but can be seen from land sunning
themselves on nearly any warm day. The
long-nosed crocs, are fairly plentiful, both
in the salt and fresh water, and are very
fond of walk-about tucker, especially dogs
and goats.
tj: * ❖
“S.C.” : A handsome little wriggler is the
red-naped or scarlet-spotted snake (Pseude-
laps diadema). The name is derived from
a broad spot or collar of bright scarlet on
the nape of the neck. It is venomous, but. is
not reckoned to be deadly, and, according
to Waite, is so inoffensive that it will allow
itself to be gently handled. Its maximum
length is an inch or two over a foot. Scarlet-
spot, like most small snakes, is very retir-
ing in habit, and is therefore seldom seen by
passers-by.
“Sea Nomad”: Quarantine and other regu-
lations in northern waters sometimes carry
a little tragedy with them. A lugger trad-
ing between Thursday Island and New
Guinea recently anchored off Yam Island.
Most of the crew were Yam Island boys
who hadn't seen home for 12 months; and
though their mothers, fathers and sweet-
hearts shouted to them from the beach, the
regulations would not allow them to land.
A lugger en route to T.I. passed Darnley
Island. One of her crew lay dying. He was
LOUD AN’ ’EARTY.
“Nice bit av singin’, boay.”
“Iss, m’ son —just like ’e used to be fore they music-teachers spoilt it."
a Darnley Island man and his little daughter
waved from a grassy knoll to her father's
ship. It was his return voyage, but first of
all he had to be signed off at T.I. and then
shipped back to liis village. They buried
him, however, on a sandbank before
“Thirsty” could be reached.
“Plumper Line” : Those
pars, about New Guinea
hangings recall Deaf Bill.
He was quartermaster on
the Merrie England when
Sir William Macgregor
was rounding up the
head-hunting Tulgari tribe
for murders. Six of the
ringleaders were caught,
tried and sentenced to
death. Then a difficulty
arose : there was no hang-
man. As a last resource
Bill was approached.
Learning that the remu-
neration was a fiver apiece,
Bill said in his sign-lan-
guage, “I’ll hang every
blankard in New Guinea
at the same price.” Bill
did his work without
trimmings. A half-dozen
single blocks were rigged
in the branches of a tree ;
a good rope was reeved
through, and a noose was
1 made at each end. Some
boys were then comman-
deered to heave away.
The ropes were made fast
at Bill’s command, and
the job was done.
“Mars”: “All this tork about sprayin’
fruit-trees with a terbaccer mixture ter get
rid of aphis is wrong,” said the old chap in
a voice that challenged contradiction. “Look
at me,” he went on. “Twenny years ago I
owned one of the biggest orchards in Noo
South. One season all the orange-trees was
covered with small black hinsecks —millions
of ’em. liup comes a Gover’mint inspector,
an’ after lookin’ at the trees ’e says, ‘You’ve
got aphis on those trees, an’ you’ll ave ter
spray ’em with a terbaccer wash.’ He shows
me what ter do, an’ in a coupla days I’m
sprayin’ those trees with a mixture of ter-
baccer, soap an’ water. I got a bonzer crop
of oranges, but I will admit they smelt o’
terbaccer. The first lot I sent ter market
didn't go too well, but w’en I sent in the
oranges off the trees which got the biggest
sprayin’s— ’strutli. they was rushed. ‘W’y T
you arsks. ’Cos every one of them. oranges
had a packet o’ cigarettes in the middle. I
was on me way ter makin’ a forchin when
the Gover’mint euchres me. It hops in an’
summonses me —one summons per orange—
fer sellin’ terbaccer without a license. 0
course, I appealed, but wot between the
Gover’mint fines an’ me lawyers I went
broke.”
* * * *
“Emel” : I knew an old bullock-driver who
never swore at his team. He was a local
preacher. One dark night some of the lads
placed a plough just where he must stumble
over it on his way home, and hid near by to
hear what he would say. He fell over the
plough, but all he said was “Good gracious!"
* * * *
“Borom”: “Never-Never” (B. 13/10/’27)
is by no means exclusively Australian in
origin. It appears on one of the maps made
by Mason and Dixon (“Dixie”), the English
surveyors, who charted large areas of pre-
revolution America ; this, probably. w T as its
first geographical application. It has since
been used in Africa and South America, and
is to be found also in a description of the
Sahara by Pierre Benoit.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: The recent massacre by the
natives of Malaita, in the Solomon Islands,
of two white Government officials and their
party of native police has set going a rumor
that a general rising of native against
white throughout the Solomons is im-
minent. Those on the spot should know
best, but experience of those South Sea
Island outbreaks has taught that nothing of
the sort is to be feared. Organisation on a
large and even semi-permanent scale is quite
beyond the mental capacity of the Melane-
sian, even within a single tribe, inhabiting
only one corner of one particular island of
the hundreds which go to make up the
Solomon group. There is no more affinity
between the Melanesian of Choiseul, say,
and his blood-brotlier of near-by Bougain-
ville than there is between oil and water.
The intermingling of various tribes, and the
partial cessation of inter-tribal and inter-
village Warfare, which has been brought
about by the advent of the white man has
done nothing to mellow the old antagonisms.
There is no more chance of a general upris-
ing of the combined natives of the far-flung
group against the white settler and official
than there is of an invasion of the east
coast of Australia by a fleet of the famous
war canoes of San Cristoval. Here and
there a flash buck may be tempted to murder
by the glorious example set him in Malaita;
that and nothing more.
(Continued on page 27.)
THE ROAD TO BOURKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The condition of the main Western-road from
Sydney to Bourke is comprehensively described in a
road bulletin issued by the N.R.M.A. Touring Depart-
ment.’’
The road to Bourke in bygone days was
not the road it is,
Packed with most ev’rything on wheels from
Chevrolet to Liz.
But swagmen tramped it manfully in quest
of doubtful work,
It always heartened them to know that at
the end was Bourke!
And many men who trudged that road, with
Towser at their heels,
Sensed all that’s known of solitude, felt all
the exile feels.
They’d left behind the city's lights, the
city’s rush and roar:
In front of them the open road; ’ behind
the close-shut door!
’Twas ever “On, and further on” ; and if the
road was long,
At least ’twas not infested by a supercilious
throng.
And when great loneliness oppressed, and
feet began to drag,
The traveller could always hold communion
with his swag.
Sweet faces peered from long-dim pasts, per-
chance ; but who can tell ?
For every battler on the track has his own
private hell.
Soft voices maybe whispered, too, sweet
words that one time thrilled ;
But ah ! the dry bones rattled when that old
romance was killed.
The road to Bourke still westward runs; but
someone says, “Somehow,
It’s not the road of olden days—it's very
different now.”
Each year the swagman rarer grows, but still
he keeps his pride....
That’s why he hates the motorist who offers
him a ride !

Why General Motors
Can Give More Value
GENERAL MOTORS is the largest motor-
car manufacturing organisation in the
world.
That is important to you —and to every car
buyer everywhere—because it means that
General Motors can offer you the benefits
resulting from its size.
Last year people all over the world bought
1,215,826 General Motors cars —an increase
of 388,770 new owners in one year.
This growing demand from the public enables
General Motors to manufacture at a lower
margin of profit than would be possible if it
had few customers.
Thus every individual car buyer, everywhere,
shares in the economies made possible by all
the others.
The collective experience of General Motors
car and truck manufacturing divisions totals
more than 120 years.
General Motors was the first to establisli
great Research Laboratories —and the first to
establish a Proving Ground, where it subjects
its own and competing cars to over 100
scientific tests to prove the quality of General
Motors cars.
Consider the great savings General Motors
makes in buying materials in huge quantities.
These savings are passed on to you in better
quality at lower prices than any single manu-
facturer can possibly maintain. Add to this
purchasing economy the further savings made
possible in huge plants equipped with the most
modern machinery, and you can see that there
is every reason why General Motors cars must
be of finer quality and higher value than could
be true if the volume were smaller.
Proof of the quality and value of General
Motors cars is found in the fact that one in
every four cars sold is a General Motors car.

FLOODS OF EVIDENCE,
“Why don’t you send for the plumber?”
“Stupid! Can’t you see he has been?”
“Homfrey Beale”: An epic of the bush
was the attempted rescue by Steve Francis,
aged 60, of his mate, George King, aged 50,
from a roaring furnace that had been a
hotel at Rowena (N.S.W.). The two had
been digging drains in the neighborhood, and
on the Sunday night of the fire were staying
at the hotel. Francis was standing with
others, all of them having barely escaped
being burnt to death in their bedclothes,
when he suddenly realised that his mate was
missing. Shouting “George! George!” he
dodged the hands that would have held him
and shot into the burning building. A couple
of minutes later he staggered out, a sheet of
flame. He was just able to gasp out “George
isn’t in his room” before he went down ; he
died on the way to Collarenebri hospital.
King's charred remains were found later
where a hallway had been.
:I: s': * *
“Trampas”: Are goats cannibals? The
query is prompted by the fact that some of
the islands inside the Barrier Reef are popu-
lated by hundreds of Bills and Nans, they
having been dumped there long ago for
reasons now unknown. The sea-bound
demesnes of these bleating castaways are
practically destitute of foliage and water
for months in the year. How do they live?
“E.S.”: A notorious egg-
stealer is Kojurrie, the lace
lizard. He takes observations
from a tall tree, and when no
one is about sneaks into the
fowlhouse, going from box to
box. When he finds some eggs
(he rises on his hind legs and
peers into each nest) he gets
three-parts into the box and
takes the lot, shells and all. If
discovered he scorches for the
nearest tree, and while getting
aloft shows all his cleverness in
keeping out of view. I saw Dad
Slocum chase one to a big blue
gum. After twice circling the
tree he concluded that the wily
lizard had got into a hole some-
where. Then I went round one
side and Slocum the other, and
the thief was discovered only
half-way up the trunk. Finding
himself thus tricked, Kojurrie
poked his tongue out in an in-
sulting manner, and went slowly
up in a straight line.
“Caveman”: I have a blind canary. It
spends nearly all the day on the floor of the
cage, and lately has resumed its singing’ and
whistling, dropped during the winter. It
knows where its feed- and water-bowls are,
and at night flies to its corner nest without
hesitation. It does not, however, use the
perches, having apparently forgotten how
to reach them.
“Gordelplius": Strange friendships spring
up amongst station stock. In one of the
paddocks of a Murchison ( W.A.) run di-overs
on their way south abandoned a young filly
foal too poor to travel. Some of the mus-
tcrers’ horses were turned out in this pad-
dock, and one of them, a gelding we called
Gilbert, took a
fancy to her. Sep-
arating from his
usual pals, he took
the foal to places
where there was
plenty of feed and
water, and man-
aged to rear her so
successfully that
she became one of
the best stock
horses on the
pla c e. As Miss
Gilbert she was
always known.
And even though
Miss Gilbert had
several foals, she
and Gilbert re-
in a i n e d firm
friends. The over-
s e e r usually
arranged that they
should be on the
same mustering
camps. A bell on
either of them was
sufficient, for they
never separated,
but always fed by
themselves. If any
other horse, of
either sex, came
near his mate, Gil-
bert would flatten
his ears, toss his
head, bare his teeth
and fight if it was
necessary it
rarely was. Finally
Miss Gilbert was
badly staked dur-
ing a cattle muster,
and had to be shot.
Gilbert tolled his
condamine for the last time a few weeks
later.
* $ * *
“Up Top” : Just before the nor'-west sea-
son Beidam, the shark, tilts his starry nose
towards the sea. This is the signal to Torres
Strait islanders that the turtles are mating.
In the old days the Zogo-man anointed the
Zogo-stone with human oil and supplicated
the elements to bring good weather and
turtle in plenty. He called upon the spirit
of energy to imbue the eyes and arms of the
harpooners with quickness, accuracy and
strength. The canoes were garlanded with
crotons and made flash with island flowers,
a big bamboo filled with water was taken
aboard, and the first cruise of the season
commenced. By some crooning reef, near
whose grass-grown bottom the turtle fed, the
canoes would halt and the witch-doctor make
SIZING THINGS UP.
“I wouldn’t like to be that gentleman, mummy, when he gets tummy ache.”
charm again to attract the turtle from the
sea. To the four winds he scattered gifts of
bananas and yams for the good spirit which
fills the bellies of men, and raised his arms
and voice to attract the spirit from the skies.
The feast commenced with the capturing of
the first green-bacaed turtle. If the first
catch happened to be a tortoise its mottled
plates were fashioned into lovely ornaments
for girls and men, the meat being cast away.
“Runa”: I always lend a respectful ear
to the tales of lions and tigers wandering
in the bush, remembering the youthful
experience in Vic. of an engineer of my
acquaintance. He was crossing a dry creek-
bed on his way home from Sunday-school
when he noticed a large brown animal lying
on the bank near a waterhoP. Hurrying
home, he reported a lion down by the
creek, and was punished by a scandalised
Scotch family for the awful offence of telling
lies on the Sabbath. A week later a party
of men from the nearest township came
into the district seeking a young lion that
had escaped from a circus. The youngster
was forgiven, with apologies.
“Yabbie”: Can any Abo. explain why
couch-grass grows along the margin of
artesian bore drains, though it may not be
found anywhere else within a hundred miles?
I saw a new bore drain ploughed on a C.Q.
station ; in six months there was a foot-wide
border of couch-grass on each side for a
length of five miles. Also, small, blunt-nosed
fish about 3in. long swam down its stream.
I’ll guarantee that neither couch-grass nor
that breed of fish could have been found any-
where in the locality before the hot water
came up from down-under.

“Dick the Fossicker” : I’ve seen some wild
flowers in my time —orchids in the Queens-
land scrubs, desert-peas out from Broken
Hill and flower-gems on the Buffalo plateau
in Victoria. But you have to go to Westralia
for the greatest show of all. In the mulga
country, North Coolgardie goldfields, after a
wet winter, the splendor of the pink and
white “everlastings” is unsurpassed. They
seem to spring up almost overnight, covering
thousands of acres. They keep their beauty
far into the summer. The Boorabbin sand-
plain, midway betweeen Coolgardie and
Southern Cross, is another of Nature’s
flower-beds. Every spring it is covered with
a wonderful carpet of wildflowers, of every
shape and color. But in most parts of the
Westralian wheat belt in springtime you can
see acres of everlastings, pink and white, on
the edge of the crops.
“Up North” : Ivelusu and Samu have given
up venturesome trips in an open boat. They
set sail for Nagheer Island and were return-
ing in terrific weather with a cargo of turtle
eggs. The lugger David Pitt, herself making
heavy weather, saw them occasionally, their
boat like a tossing cork, and gradually made
her way towards the adventurers. Luckily,
not until the lugger was almost alongside
did the tiny craft go over. A big wave
showed momentarily a floating keel, two dere-
lict hats and thousands of tiny white balls
-turtle-eggs. Every man on the lugger,
except the steersman, went overside and man-
aged to clear the entangled men. A tiny
locker in the bows of the submerged boat was
watertight and prevented her from sinking
wholly. Under water the boys kept diving,
hacked the mast and rigging clear, and finally
managed to trice the vessel to the David Pitt
—an almost superhuman task in such a
raging sea. All they worried about was
sharks, for there were enough turtle-eggs bob-
bing around to lure all the sharks in the
Coral Seas.

“Phil P.”: The pit-sawyer played a
prominent part in the old colonial times.
In Tassie’s shipbuilding days the planking
and timbers were all turned out by hand, and
some hefty tree-trunks were divided. At
Long Bay, 20-odd miles south of Hobart,
a piece of bluegum 14Gt't. in length and ISin.
by 6in. in girth, was pit-sawn and forwarded
to the ’5l Crystal Palace Exhibition. A
still longer cut of IGOft. is probably the
record hand-ripped slab for all Australia.
Another junk 32ft. long, 32in. by 26in.,
clear of heart and sap, was also sent to Eng-
land.

“Whoa, Strawberry”: Tell “J.LI.S.” (B.
15/9/’27) that, as to the variation in the
names of different timbers, he was somewhat
mixed in the examples he gave. Crow’s
ash is not known by any other names than
“Flindosy” and teak; bumpy ash is a
timber of the same family, but with a totally
different habit of growth. It is known also
as cudgerie, mountain ash and silver ash.
“Maiden’s blush.” too, is known as cudgerie,
and also as pink poplar and blush cudgerie.
Beech is not unlike-“maiden’s blush” in grain,
but there the resemblance ends, as beech will
last a lifetime in the weather and the other
a few weeks only. The other timbers
“J.H.S,” mentions under the name of
“maiden’s blush” are totally different trees.
Pencilwood is known also as pencilwood
cedar, newchum cedar, deep-yellow wood
and Chinaman cedar. Ribbonwood I do not
know, and I have been bullock-driving in
this Queensland district for years.
# * * *
“Bulantum”: Excellent specimens of the
small brown bear mentioned by “Lagani-
Namo” (B. 28/7/’27) are found at Edie
Creek, in the Mandated Territory. The alti-
tude here is from 6000 to 8000 feet. The fur
is very thick, and the skins, which are easily
tanned, make fine rugs. The flesh of the
little animal, which lives on mosses and
leaves, is also good eating.
* * * *
“Mei”: It is not the dog only that can be
trusted to take a note home (B. 8/9/’27).
I once found myself 20 miles from our home,
faced with the problem of having no water
for my horse, though I must stay for a week.
Tying a note to his forelock, I turned him
on to the road. To avoid gates, he went home
by a roundabout track over which he had
travelled only twice before. He swam the
creek near the house, and walked up to the
yard, where the note was spied, the result
being that someone brought him out to me
when I wanted him —at the end of the week.
THE DROUGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sheep are dying all the way from here
to Tilberoo ;
At Hunthawong and Merrigal and old Kia-
katoo;
At Trida and Urugabali and on Willandra
run....
But what’s the use to fume and fret?
It’s months and months since last we met;
Another round and let’s forget!
We’ve earned our bit of fun!
Chorus.
Another round of drinks, my lads,
We’ll have the same again!
The crows are on the boundary-fence,
The dingoes on the plain!
Another toast, my smiling host,
Before you turn us out:
“Here’s to Ilell with the blasted crows,
And the Devil take the drought!”
At water-carting, picking wool and cutting
down the scrub
We’ve toiled and moiled for half a year, and
never seen a pub.
Of boiling-down and burning-up we’ve had
our bingie full—
From blazing morn to blanky night.
For half a year we’ve fought the fight,
And now’s the time for getting tight;
To Bradford with the wool!
Ciiorus.
Another round of drinks, my boys,
A round before we start!
The banks have stopped the overdrafts;
The boss is in the cart!
The creeks are dry, and so am I,
But while there’s beer about —
“Here’s to half a foot of rain,
And the Devil take the drought!”
Another drink! The last to-night! The very
last.... with nve!
We’ve only got another week to finish up
the spree!
We’ll soon be on the perish—let’s be merry
while we may;
Then off to old Uabalong.
And Eulundah and Hunthawong,
And Bell’s Willandra Billabong
Before the break of day!
Chorus.
So landlord, bring another round,
And have your own, as well!
And raise your glass, and drink a toast
Before you ring the bell;
There’s still another bottle,
And it’s up to me to shout—
“ Here’s to wool at half a crown.
And blast the blazing drought!”

THE DIMINISHING WHEAT YIELD.
“Leo Lear”: Diminishing wheat yields
generally occur in wet localities, and are in
many cases due to modern methods of farm-
ing. Years ago all ploughing was done with
single mould-board implements. Great care
was taken, sods were narrow and well
packed over the edge of the previous one
turned. This left a small triangular space
under every furrow which acted as a drain,
and water quickly ran off. Now-a-times discs
and multiple-shared ploughs toss the ground
all ways, and it harrows down flat and solid
with no get-away for surplus moisture. Old-
time ploughing matches were about as excit-
ing as a Scotch Sabbath, hut they taught
Cocky to do his job properly.
Another likely reason for a smaller return
is that hybridisers are more troubled over
drought resisters, and the old wet country
wheats are out of fashion. Hence the seed
is unsuitable for wet localities.
WHEAT IN THE MALLEE.
“Glenfield” : At no time in my experience
in the n.w. Mallee has the benefit of a
heavy dressing of superphosphate, been so
marked as in the wheat crop this abnor-
mally dry year. The dressing of super. ,on
one paddock of fallow (sown with the first
fall of rain) was increased from the usual
901 b. to 1121 b. At time of writing the crop
stands 2ft. 6in. high. On a strip where the
manure in the drill gave out the wheat
is only 6in. high. This explodes the theory
still cherished by some old cockies that a
heavy dressing of super, in a dry year burns
off the crop.
Another object-lesson in the same pad-
dock is the contrast between the productivity
of fallowed and unfallowed land. A
shire by-law insists that one chain width be
left unfallowed along fences adjacent to the
road. At cropping time this piece was
ploughed, scarified, harrowed and combined
in. With the exception of a few plants
here and there struggling for life, the crop
on this strip is past praying for.
REFORMING THE DAIRY INDUSTRY.
“Hatter”: The Housewives’ Association,
which is quarrelling with the 3d. per lb. levy
on butter consumed in Australia, contends
that Australian consumers are penalised
owing to the inefficient organisation of the
dairying industry, and undoubtedly there is
much truth in the objection. We could
learn a good deal on this subject from Den-
mark, which runs more cows to the acre
and averages a higher production of butter-
fat to the cow than any other country,
despite the fact that the cows are stall-fed
for eight months of the year.
Here are some of the disabilities under
which the Australian dairy industry suffers :
The average low productivity of our herds
—probably 90 per cent, are below the Danish
standard.
Unscientific feeding. Less food, at lower
cost but rightly proportioned, would give on
many farms far better results, and so effect
a double economy. Feeding is in fact quite
as important as selection and breeding. It
is well known that Australian pastures lack
lime and phosphates, without which no grow-
ing animals or milking cows can thrive. It
would be easy to supply a ration of two or
three ounces of crushed bonemeal per day,
which is all that is required; but the dairy-
farmer is curiously apathetic, and any travel-
ler through the back country may note that
the thriftless bone-chewer is frequently in
evidence, and that the cattle in general have
an ill-nourished appearance. In addition to
supplying bone-forming material, it is most
important to give the right proportion of
flesh-forming bulky foods (sucli t as hay, chaff
or roots) in combination with concentrates,
or muscle- and milk-forming foods (such as
bran, oilcake, linseed meal, etc.).
It requires a certain amount of study and
intelligence to properly balance a ration
according to the requirements of the animal
and the kinds of fodder available, but an
enormous saving in costs could be effected
in this direction. Ration cards could be
tabulated and supplied to farmers at small
cost by the Agricultural Department. Rape-
seed cake is credited with producing thgt
smooth consistency and pleasing flavor on
which the reputation of Danish butter
largely relies.
The lack of that scrupulous cleanliness so
essential in dairy work results in poor
quality cream, which is the curse of the
industry. By dint of persistent propaganda
the Danes have learnt to consider milking
as a ceremonial rite, to be performed accord-
ing to strict regulations, legally enforced.
Hot water and washing facilities are part
of the necessary equipment of the milking
sheds. The milkers, who never do any rough
or dirty work, in order that their hands may
be kept smooth, don speckless overalls and
scrub up with the assiduity that is associated
in this country with the man who extracts
teeth rather than milk, and the cream is
kept under hygienic conditions from the
start.
Australia has an enormous butter pro-
duction relatively to its population, and the
possessor of large tracts of fertile country
and ideal climatic conditions give her a tre-
mendous pull over Northern Europe. But
with her high wages it is essential to pro-
duce the best quality butter and so secure
every penny possible on the London market,
whereas, owing to happy-go-lucky methods,
she takes only third place—Denmark being
first and Maoriland second.
WAR ON THE SLOW MILKERS.
“L’Fou” : In spite of the great improve-
ment in dairy herds brought about by herd-
testing, there is one trait not receiving
needed attention by breeders. That is the
elimination of cows “tough” or difficult to
milk. Machine-milking is still the excep-
tion rather than the rule, and labor coSts
are one of the farmer’s most acute problems.
Yet among cows yielding the same quantity
of milk one may be milked in eight minutes
and another may take anything up to half
an hour. This trait, like heavy milk pro-
duction, is usually hereditary. Yet, pro-
vided yield and tests are good, there seems
to he no discrimination against those cows
that are snags to milk. Even at shows one
sees prize-winners with awkward and un-
manageable teats. The efficient: cow should
no more consume a farmer’s time without
making adequate return than it should con-
sume his food. But the average dairy-farmer,
in making his balance, never has allowed a
fair thing for his own time and labor and
that of his wife and family.
HERD-TESTING IN VICTORIA.
“P.M.” : Vic. herd-testing associations are
not as well run as “Titun” makes out (B.
15/9/’27). The tester has to provide his
own horse and vehicle to travel from farm to
farm' and the farmer always has to put up
the tester and his horse. The salary runs
from £3 10s. to £4 7s. 6d. a week and keep
as above. I doubt if there is one tester
getting £250 p.a. and keep as suggested by
“Titun.” The associations usually adver-
tise “State salary required,” and take tlie
cheapest man they can get. There is no
tester’s certificate. There is a cream and
milk tester’s certificate for butter-factory
work; but-most of the herd testers haven t
got it, and presumably couldn’t pass for it.
Whether they are sufficiently qualified to test
cows accurately is a matter on which there
is a lot of argument.
“Titun’s” par would lead one to believe
that the Vic. dairy cocky is doing the job
efficiently and without running to the Gov-
ernment for assistance, but the State pays
half the cost.
BABY BEEF.
“FY7” : Sorry if my comment on baby beef
doesn’t get “Almanac” (B. 6/10/’27) any-
where, but that is because he hasn’t fol-
lowed it. The comment was based on a
recent report issued by the British Meat
Marketing Board, and made clear the fact
that only the American, British and Euro-
pean trade was as yet affected by the new
demand, which has now been recognised in
those quarters as insistent and inescapable.
No attempt was made to infer that
the demand for this class of meat had yet
developed in Australia, or that cattle of the
tvpe indicated by the oversea experts yet
existed in Australia. That they are being
bred elsewhere is evidenced by the board’s
remarks, and these have been echoed by
more than one Australian who has taken the
trouble to inform himself on the subject. As
to breeding what “Almanac” calls “freak
beasts.” the answer from the authority
quoted is that they are being bred, and that
the American, Argentine and British breeders
are now putting beef on the market at 18
months old. In short, his position is exactly
that of the old lady who, when confronted
with a hippopotamus, said doggedly “I don’t
believe there ain’t no such animal!”
DECENTRALISED KILLING.
“Cliump Chop - ’: For over 50 years prac-
tically all the stock slaughtered to teed
Sydney has been brought from all parts
the State to Homebush abattoirs. these
beasts are huddled, sometimes for days, m
railway trucks, and in hot weather, they
suffer terribly from, thirst. They arrive in
a condition that necessitates a big percentage
of rejections, and the meat of those that do
pass the vet. isn't what it might be. -Any-
body who has tasted fresh-killed mutton or
beef on the farm knows the difference. Ihe
centralised system means a big annual loss
to the stock-raisers and an inferior meat
supply for the metropolis. It’s the same in
other Australian centres as it is in Sydney.
The system may have been all right oO or
even 30 years ago, but it doesn’t work well
now. The remedy? Establish abattoirs in
the stock-raising centres and chill the meat
for transport to the city. Meat-chilling is
no longer a hazardous experiment in Aus-
tralia, as the successful sale of recent ship-
ments in Britain gives testimony. . Chilled
meat has excellent keeping qualities, but
every city housewife in Australia knows she
has to sniff at the meat the butcher supplies,
and even if it is all right, or apparently all
right, when it goes into her basket it may be
tainted before she gets it home. Decen-
tralised slaughtering would mean better
meat, fresher meat and cheaper meat
cheaper because there would be far fewer re-
jections. I believe there’s a society battling
away for this reform, and getting a lot of
support, too. Its object is mostly to avoid
cruelty to the animals, but I think there’s
good sound practical business reasons in
favor of killing as near as possible to where
tlie stock is raised.
ASSISTING THE FARMER.
“Spike”: “Jack Point” fB. 6/10/’27) is
hopelessly wrong in supposing that there is
a dearth of expert advice available in this
country to the man on the land. In N.S.W.
alone there are at least a dozen experi-
mental farms in different parts of the State
where information can be obtained for the
asking. .
Experiments in wheat-breeding, which
occupy years to finalise, are carried out
solely for the benefit of the cocky, and the
names of Robert Hurst and the late William
Farrer will suffice to indicate the class of
expert employed in this direction.
The Department of Agriculture, which
handles these experimental institutions, has
not overlooked the sheepman either. As far
as the merino is concerned, the aim has been
to produce as large a framed animal as pos-
sible without a corresponding deterioration
in fleece quality, and the result of Wrenford
Mathews’s experiments along these lines has
been gratifying. With a view to producing
an ideal carcase for the export mutton trade
the Dorset Horn was persevered with for
seven years to my knowledge. That the
result was rather disappointing was not the
fault of the department.
The breeding of farm horses has been
another feature, and the resultant improve-
ment of this class of animal is marked.
In addition, highly-qualified experts period-
ically deliver lectures of a technical nature
in all parts of the State on poultry-raising,
fruit-growing and wool, and the various
branches of farming.
There is no doubt the experimental farms
offer a great deal of assistance to the estab-
lished cocky, but they do not assist the
embryo farmer who serves a two or three
years’ apprenticeship on them to as great an
extent as they might. He gets the notion
that ensilage must be conserved in elaborate
and costly overhead silos and that pigs must
occupy quarters which shearers would con-
sider ' palatial. The theoretical knowledge
lie has gained, however, will be of inestimable
value if he serves a further term as jackeroo
to a practical man before taking up land
for himself.
BRING BACK THE BLACKSMITH.
“Country Bed.” : A few years back, when
a serious defect developed in any of the
farm machinery, the farmer simply yoked up
Iris horses and hauled the offending imple-
ment a mile to the blacksmith, who, without
any undue delay, made the necessary repairs.
But the blacksmith has retired and closed
his business, for he had no apprentice ready
to take his place, and there were no buyers
for his shop. And he couldn’t repair a
tractor if it was brought to him. Not that
he has not the ability, but because he has not
the necessary appliances. It is the same all
over the country. Where a few years back
there were competent blacksmiths in every
village, now one has a struggle to exist in
the average country town, which easily sup-
ports' three or four motor-garages. _
From a national point of view it is not
well that the race of sturdy, clever village-
blacksmiths —men who could turn their hands
to anything —should be allowed to die out.
The horse is not such a back-number as the
machinery manufacturers would have us
believe ; but where are young fellows learning
to shoe horses properly? In England steps
are being taken to preserve the ancient craft.
A blacksmith’s demonstration-van is touring
the country with the object of showing rural
smiths how to repair modern implements, like
tractors, with the aid of up-to-date machinery
and oxy-acetylene welding plants —in short,
to do the well-paid jobs that are now being
sent to the cities. To encourage boys to
learn the trade special demonstrations are
reserved for boys between 12 and 14 in order
to show them that, by the applications of
modern methods in the smithy, the black-
smith can become a highly skilled and well-
paid mechanic as well. Something similar
should be attempted in Australia before it is
too late. Since the farmer and the black-
smith are interdependent, a method that
should prove successful in this direction would
be to attach a blacksmith’s demonstration
car to the Better-farming Trains that are
doing so much to help the farmers.
GRILLER COCKERELS.
“Momok ni”: Every spring there are
thousands of white leghorn cockerels
going a-begging, asking for a home before
necks are wrung and their bodies cast on
the manure heap. But there’s money in em.
At one month, the age when their sex is
ascertainable, the young ’uns are over the many
ailments which beset the incubator-chick, and
are usually sturdy little blokes with
huge appetites. For these no nicely-balanced
ration calculated to produce eggs is needed.
Plenty of fattening food, small ranging
ground and ample water and sleep are
required, so a dark shed and a small run
suffice for lodgings. Cheap biscuit-meal
from the biscuit factories, with the house-
hold scraps, finely chopped potato peels, cab-
bage stalks and anything eatable will do
for food. On a liberal diet these small birds
soon put on enough flesh to justify the
name of grillers, and to anyone who is con-
tent with small profits and quick returns
they are a paying proposition. To those who
live within easy reach of the main motor
roads, the numerous stalls provide a quick
market, especially for ready-dressed chickens.
If these small grillers are trussed as for
boiling, with the thigh bones dislocated and
the thighs pushed well up to the breast, they
present a nice, compact little bird, and are
toothsome morsels when roasted.
ORANGES v. MANDARINS.
“E.M.” : While fruit-growers in the south-
ern parts of Bananaland may find the man-
darin profitable to cultivate (B. 29/9/’27),
growers higher up have not been making a
fortune out of it of late years. Unlike the
orange, the mandarin is not a heavy regular
bearer, one decent crop in three years being
about the average run of things. Then the
Emperor of Canton mandarin, which is
by far the most favored variety and the best
seller, is easily wrenched off by strong winds,
even when only partly grown, and a bit of
a blow out of the ordinary is apt to strip
the entire crop from the trees. This has
happened twice within the last six years,
and this season growers in scrubby localities
on the coast lost practically the whole of
the main crop through insect pests. This
season a number of growers did well out ot
a late crop (the second crop usually escapes
the ravages of insects), which set after the
heavy rains in December. Taken year in
and 'year out, 100 good orange-trees will
return a better income than the same number
of the best mandarin-trees.
CITRUS FRUITS AND SOIL.
“NSA”: Apple-growers of Groperland
(“Boronia,” B. 29/9/’27) are not alone in
their insistence on certain sorts of soil for
particular orchard varieties. It has long
been established that citrus fruits grown on
the poorer highlands possess much better
keeping qualities than those grown on the
rich, alluvial flats. Tests held three years
ago ’ proved this conclusively, and export-
buyers had known it for years. It is also
an' accepted fact that the fine kid-glove skins
that grace the aristocrats of the citrus family
are procurable only on the poorer lands.
Rich soil undoubtedly ensures larger crops
of good-quality oranges and mandarins, but
if wet weather prevails during harvesting
the fruit often moulds in the case. This
has seldom been known to happen under
similar circumstances with fruit grown on
poorer classes of land.
SOUTH AFRICAN WOOL.
“Staple” : Yet another comparison between
South African fine wools and the Australian
variety comes from Harry Dawson, presi-
dent of the British Wool Federation, who
may be presumed to know what lie is talk-
ing’ about. His criticism endorses the opinion
of a dozen other experts printed in The
Bulletin during the last 12 months. Daw-
son says that South African wool is now
the finest in the world, and he advises the
S.A. breeders to maintain its quality, “and
not follow the example of Australia in try-
ing to make more money by e-rowing coarse
wool. Merit and value count, all the world
over.” To this and similar criticisms the
reply of the coarse-wool protagonists in Aus-

100/ BRITISH!
AS an organisation Leyland Motors, Ltd., is
as thoroughly British as the Leyland Lorry
itself, which has been made in Lancashire for
thirty years. Every penny of the Leyland
capital of £1,800,000 is British owned, and
the workers, from directors down, are British
to a .man.
Direct Factory Representation
in Australia.
Leyland markets, and will continue to market,
its Lorries in Australia through its own
branches, thus offering the immense facilities
of the English factory DIRECT to Australians.
Every Leyland Lorry represents the best pos-
sible investment over the longest period in
heavy motor transport, and the money paid
for Leylands does that which the proceeds
from foreign products can never do——it
enables Great Britain to purchase Australian
wool, wheat and other products.

tralia is invariably the same. It is that
Australian growers can grow superfine
merinos if they want to, and some of them
do ; but that they find it pays better to get a
heavier coarse fleece off a sheep than to go
for the lighter one of superior quality. But
Australia’s reputation as a wool-producing
country was built up and maintained on the
production of a superfine merino type that
could not then be matched anywhere else on
earth, and fine merino wool is in as good
demand and bringing as good prices as ever.
Most of those who barrack so fiercely for
the coarse wool obsession in Australia would
seem to be brokers or other types of middle-
men selling wool on commission. To these
a great weight output of medium quality
means a lot more than a comparatively
smaller turnover of lighter and better-priced
fine wools.
“IN” AND “OUT” WEIGHTS OF WOOL.
“Taparap”: “Lath” (B. 6/10/’27) has evi-
dently had no experience in a wool-store.
liis remarks on wool being sold on “in”
instead of “out” weights compensating the
grower for the loss of draft are absolute
twaddle. One of the conditions of sale is
that a buyer may have a lot re-weiglied for
a fee of 6d. per bale, the only condition being
(a) that the whole lot and not a particular
bale must be re-weighed, and (b) that he
must pay for any increase in weight. If
the lot is underweight the fee is not usually
charged. The reason this privilege is seldom
used is that wool gains weight while in store
by absorbing moisture from the atmosphere.
When a grower is unable to get his wool to
store for a fairly long period after shearing
he usually receives a pleasant surprise on
comparing the store weights with those from
the shed.
TWEED RIVER POSSIBILITIES
“N.M.L.”: Since “bunchy top” came a
few years ago many of the banana growers
on the Tweed River have chucked the game
and the land has reverted to a limited area
of cane and to much cow. But it's too good
a country for a fairly poor type of Straw-
berry to trample under foot; cane is full to
the neck, and no more country may be
planted, and if bananas and other fruits are
doomed there should be other means of
utilising the country than that of teat jug-
gling.
New Zealand flax grows there and thrives
luxuriantly. Isn’t there any money in flax?
Sisal-hemp only wants showing the earth
and it grabs and grows. Other countries
make money out of sisal-hemp. Passion-
fruit matures there a month earlier than
they can market it from Gosford. That
means big prices. Passions at a half-crown
a dozen —which I’ve received myself—shade
even the golden banana. All citrus fruits
grow to perfection. Pineapples revel in the
soil and climate. Why should this superfine
country be given over to cream-vans and
pig-carts?
MANURING POTATOES.
“Curlew”: In experiments in manuring
potatoes in Victoria various quantities of
superphosphate up to Dr.wt. per acre have
been tried, and beyond a certain quantity
there has been no improvement—in some
cases even a decided loss in the returns.
Unless one knows how manures are used
by plants one may go astray. The manure
used by a crop is determined by the amount
of moisture in the soil. The growing points
of roots are simply a collection of minute
cells which may be compared to very minute
shell-less eggs. Solids, however minute, can-
not enter them. The growing points of
roots can absorb only “thin” fluids —heavy
fluids in contact with them tend to draw
the moisture out of the cells, when there
cannot be growth, but the reverse—“burn-
ing” of crops from superphosphate in a dry
season is an example.
In planting potatoes (or anything else),
if the manure be placed in contact with the
seed, very large quantities are not to be
recommended unless there is abundant mois-
ture. Even then it is advisable to distribute
half the manure on the surface, to be worked
well into the soil, the balance being more
nearly in contact with the seed. In any case
it has to be borne in mind that if the roots
can get plenty of nutrition close handy they
will not search in poorer soil at a distance,
so that by heavy manuring in contact with
the seed the tendency is to keep the roots
from spreading and taking advantage of the
moisture and nutrition of the whole of the
soil. Manuring of potatoes is not everything.
The soil must have warmth, good drainage
and a soft, crumbly texture.
IMPORTED PARASITES.
“Nox”: The Imperial Agricultural
Research Conference, which opened in Lon-
don last week, is discussing many matters of-
vital interest to the man on the land. One
of the most important matters for considera-
tion is that of plant and animal pests, and
this should particularly appeal to Austra-
lians, who are afflicted with most of the
pests that the rest of the agricultural and
pastoral world is heir to, with the excep-
tion, perhaps, of the boll weevil, and have a
few specialties of their own, among them the
prickly-pear, innocuous in other lands. The
conference will disclose the latest methods
of dealing with the evil. The boll weevil and
the gipsy moth are quoted as costing the
empire many millions yearly, and what has
been lost to Queensland by the pear invasion
and to Victoria and Maoriland by the black-
berry vine must run into huge sums, though
the losses have never been methodically cal-
culated. In nearly all cases the tendency
of modern science is to fight pests, either
vegetable or animal, with living creatures
that are themselves a pest to the attacked
species. Many of these attack only one
animal and plant, and as Queensland experi-
ence with the pear has shown, to quote only
one instance of many, the living parasite is
producing better and cheaper results than
the elaborate methods of* poisoning or
gassing which were at first experimented
with. To discover fresh parasites and to
improve the usefulness of those already in
employment is one of the chief objectives of
the conference. In this regard, the British
•Government has done something to help by
establishing a parasite “zoo” in England.
This breeds tested and warranted stocks, and
exports them on order to any portion of the
Empire requiring their assistance.
ONE WAY OF IRRIGATING.
“Curlew”: Tom Gibbs, of Violet Town,
Vic., has a selection so situated that the
drainage off 500 acres comes down a gully.
Gibbs is not in an irrigation area with a
State behind him to spend millions for his
benefit, and he hadn’t much of his own—
only a pair of old prads, a plough, a scoop
and a pair of very willing hands. So he
set to work to place an embankment across
the gully. For six months he toiled, building
a dam 300 yards in length and 16ft. deep
at the middle. He could drive a dray along
the top yffien it was finished, so you may be
able to figure the quantity of earth in it.
liis neighbors thought lie was a shingle
short. But the winter rains filled the pocket
to overflowing, giving a sheet of water 300
yards across by about 400 yards long. Tom
put a boat on it and stocked it with blackfish,
so that he could enjoy half-pounders taken
at his back door instead of having to go
half a day’s journey to the Broken River.
On the flat below he planted six acres of
grape vines and four acres of currants, and
the season I saw them he had grapes and
currants galore—not to speak of a stack
of lucerne. That year he had more than
enough produce from his irrigation scheme
to pay for the whole of the work. Droughts
would lose much of their sting if everyone
with the same opportunities could see them
and seize them as Tom Gibbs did.
MELON GROWING.
“Yufu” : To grow rock-melons successfully,
use well-rotted fowl manure. When the
vines are in flower nip off the tips, and so
throw strength back into the fruit. When
the melons are coming on it is a good plan
to place some straw beneath them, as this
saves callousing.
Plant water-melons in small hills. Have
four plants to each hill —the hill well-
rotted manure and earth —and stand in the
centre of it an old kerosene-tin with a few
small holes punctured in its bottom. When
the plants are up half-fill the tin with cow
manure and then fill it up to the brim with
water. Keep the tin always full, and the
liquid manure thus formed is fed in small
even portions through the holes in the tin
to the plant roots below. Melons grown thus
are always a success, no matter how dry the
season is.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Curlew”: To remedy soft-shell eggs mix
a small quantity of lime—a cupful to every
20 hens —with the soft food. The lime should
have a quantity of water added to slake it.
After a time mix in the pollard or other
ingredients. Lime is better than shell-grit
at any time. Slake half a kerosene-tin full
at a time, using plenty of water. Empty on
the ground where the hens can get it, and
repeat before all is used up. This cures
soft-shells and egg-eating.
“Curlew”: For colic in a horse dissolve
a handful of salt in water or milk and pour
it down Dobbin’s throat. It istops the
formation of gas almost instantly. As a
supplementary treatment, improvise an
enema with a couple of feet of small hose
and administer through the rectal passage
a couple of gallons of luke-warm soapy
water.
“Poncirus”: Ordinary paraffin-wax is
quite as good as the specially-prepared article
for fruit-grafting purposes, and is far less
trouble. It may be bought under the trade
name of Para-Wax. To use, melt the wax
in one can and stand it in another con-
taining hot water. Apply the melted wax
to the grafts with a small brush, and the job
is finished. Buds put into stocks during wet
seasons may be treated with a thin layer of
paraffin-wax or beeswax to keep the water
out.
“Hop Scrub”: “J.G.’s” grafting waxes (B.
13/10/’27) are good, but they have to be
melted before applying. Here is a grafting
wax that can be bottled and applied cold
with a brush: Melt lib. resin over a gentle
fire ; add lib. beef tallow and stir. Mix in one
tablespoonful of turps, add 7oz. pure alcohol
and heat carefully. Put in a wide-mouthed
bottle and cork well. It is good for six
months, and is particularly adapted for small
work, such as whip-tongue grafts on avoca-
does, custard-apples and mangoes. It can, of
course, be used for work with deciduous trees.
The wax sets as hard as cement after an
hour’s exposure to the air.
“Hop Scrub”: An easily obtainable
material that is quite a good substitute for
wax in grafting is ordinary insulating tape.
It is adhesive, easy to wrap, and excludes air
and water. Take care to cover the junction
between stock and scion, easily done by
cutting a slit in a piece of the tape and
passing the scion through it —pressing the
black ribbon-like material well down around
bark and bud.
“F.S.H.”: When your strawberries have
finished flowering and the green fruit is on.
go round each plant and place a litter of
straw beneath the berries and leaves. This
not only protects the fruit from the earth,
but keeps the moisture in the ground to feed
the plant, and causes a slight steam that
appears to help the berries considerably.
“Yufu”: Feather-eating is a habit that
- afflicts fowls that have been fed on heating
and stimulating food while kept too closely
confined. To cure it, change the diet, and
give the fowls an abundance of green food.
For cxerc’se, make them scratch for their
. corn by burying it in a scratch-pen of
leaves and straw. Also hang their green
food up in bundles, just high enough to make
them jump for it. If this fails to cure them,
put them in the pot.
“Yufu”: For forcing vegetables or seed-
lings. you can’t beat superphosphate dis-
solved in water. About a tablespoonful of the
fertiliser to two gallons of water is the right
mixture; a stronger one will burn your
plants out of the ground. Superphosphate
also gives a deeper color to rose blooms if a
little of it is sprinkled round the base of the
tree and dug in when the buds first begin to
form.

THE BEDTIME MOVIES.
Each night I set myself to try
And lull my infant son to sleep
With legends of the nursery—

In vain the glamourie that once
Availed to set me all a-dream.
He cries, “That stuff is sure th’ bunce ;
I’ll tell y’, brother, it’s a scream.”
I tell him of the dimpling Queen
Who, in her parlor, dark and sweet,
Spreads golden honey on her bread,
Ambrosia fit for gods to eat.
And of her Royal spouse, the King
Who countetli ducats one by one.
Ho says, “Ar, cut th’ bull, ole thing!
I’ll tell th’ world I get y’, son.”
So off I switch to Ivanhoe
And tell a tale that stirs the blood —
Ilow Locksley, bowman stern and true,
The wrath of bad King John withstood
And, with his wizard archery,
Split willow wands at every shot.

Was caught, and Mary took the tip.

THE PRIZE PUP.
Cooraminta was enveloped in a heat-wave.
The roofs of the houses shimmered, and the
air was hazy. The local pub had done a
roaring trade ; but now, in the middle of the
day. when everyone was having a rest, the
barkeeper dozed on the bar while a mob of
flies settled about him. Everything else
seemed dead.
“Grrrrr!”
That started it. One of the.dogs, a brown,
skinny-looking mongrel with a wall eye.
stood up with its bristles erect and snarling
towards a cloud of dust preceded by a pup.
This pup had a stumpy tail and an expres-
sion that made you think it was sorry the
tail was not long enough to wag. The hair
was nearly all off its back, and the tail had
the appearance of having been through a
bush-fire.
As soon as the new arrival came on to the
verandah it and the brown mongrel were
at it.
The publican rolled out
cursing the fighters, and
with a forward thrust of his
boot sent them into the
street. The mongrel slunk
off, while the mangy pup re-
turned to the pub verandah,
where everyone was listening
to the ravings of Pintpot
Flynn, who had an attack of
the horrors. The pup seemed
to recognise a friend, and
hung around Pintpot the rest
of the day. snapping at flies.
When Pintpot got over the
horrors he inquired after the
owner of the dog, saying he
wanted to buy it. The joker
of the crowd claimed owner-
ship, whereon Pintpot began
making offers, and gradually
they rose so high that Pint-
pot had bid everything he
owned bar his shirt. The
joker refused to sell, Pintpot
swung his bluey up, and after
patting the head of the pup
moved off up the street.
After he had gone about a
hundred yards he turned
around and stood looking at
the pub. Then, as if he had
forgotten something, he re-
traced his steps until he
reached the verandah. After
a long, searching look at the
dog he turned his eyes con-
templatively to his shirt —an
old dusty flannel one —and
offered to chuck it in, too.
“In Gawd’s name, why do you want a dog
like that?” asked the publican.
“He’s a useful animal for a man to have, ’
Pintpot explained—“he killed me
quicker’n any other dog I ever had.”

A FINE, HEARTY MURDER.
The traveller outside the house gazed on
the fastened door. Said he: “I have not seen
this place for forty years and more.” The
old dame watched him through the pane and
recognised each feature. She said : “It, is my
dead son Joe! Thank Cod! The lovely
creature!” With that she opened wide the
door and called out: “Come inside!” The
wanderer picked up his “port,” and swiftly
in did glide.
She set him down beside' the fire, her only
son so dear. He said: “For Gaw’s sake, half
a crown —my soul is parched for beer.” The
widow showed him all her hoard hid under-
neath the floor; she might have had a hun-
dred pounds—-perhaps a trifle more. The
wanderer’s eyes with wicked greed at once
commenced to glitter. He got the wood-axe
from the yard, and on the head he hit her.
Her brains flew on the mantelpiece and
on the eight-day clock; great gouts and little
specks of blood he got upon his sock. He
ALL MUFFLED UP.
“My word, it’s hot to-day, isn’t it?”
“Yes! These woollen costumes are simply
suffocating!”
gathered up the golden quids; his hands with
glee did rub, and off he started up the street,
full gallop to the pub.
A constable upon his beat peered through
the open door, and saw a female’s ’lastic
sides and in’ards on the floor. He stepped
inside and there she was, an awful sight to
see. The copper said : “This is her end, it’s
plain as pie to me. I scent a horrid, sticky
crime; maybe a sick’nin’ sin. I think it’s
fairly positive a friend has done her in.” He
put the brains, the blood, the bones and
in’ards on a barrow, and wheeled them round
and round the town looking for souls to
harrow. He wandered slowly up the street,
then turned and trotted down, but shortly
paused to rest himself outside the Rose and
Crown.
Out came the wretched murderer, chock-
full was he of beer. The copper saw the
blood-stained sock, and wheeled his barrow
near.
At dawn of day the hangman came, the
parson and the vet. The rope was rigged, the
bolt was greased. . . .the last dread scene was
set.

The Monk.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
UNTIL that niglit in his flat I had
always been a little envious of Del-
gardie. It was then that I got a sight
of the tragedy of his life from the proper
angle.
To all appearances Delgardie had every-
thing that was desirable. The Delgardies
were a dying race; with the exception of
his lively and extremely different sister,
Manuel was the only survivor, and, instead
of the dissipation of family wealth by the
natural increase of heirs, several fortunes,
falling in together through the lack of other
inlieritors, had combined to put him beyond
the reach of financial troubles. He had
looks which were exceptionally fine, although
somewhat feminine; although there seemed
vaguely some delicacy with it, a fine frame
which fitted him for the part of Adonis ; and
his intelligence was above the normal. Be-
sides all which he was engaged to a girl at
whom no normal man could look without
feeling jealous of her future possessor.
The envy was, however, mingled with a
certain feeling of scorn —a feeling curiously
allied with a liking for the quiet, sensitive
fellow. At school he was his class head in
the ordinary work; but he failed lamentably
at examinations. Nothing could induce him
to play football; in rowing and in cricket
he showed the same curious characteristic
as at his lessons. At practice he shaped like
a champion; at tests he failed miserably.
To do him justice, he tried to avoid them ;
he avoided as far as possible all the competi-
tive trials which are a delight to boyhood.
We got to regard him as the possessor of
a singular yellow streak; and yet he was
liked in spite of it, and even the roughest of
us was disinclined to deliberately hurt his
sensitiveness.
It w r as often in my mind, when I met him
in our older years, that it was lucky for
Delgardie he had not to battle in the
marketplace for a living; and when I dis-
covered him engaged to Zarah Sinclair, my
feeling was almost one of scorn for a lover
whose blood was water. With a muph cooler-
veined girl than Zarah I knew my own love-
making would have been a long chapter of
hot kisses in moonlit gardens, a jealousy of
the hours when the world held any but just
us two. When, on the night of my revela-
tion, I made my way to his flat for the
game of chess we now and then played, it
was with a sense of amusement at the man
who, having a girl like Zarah, preferred to
moon at home over his game.
As I mounted the stairs I hardly noticed
the queer, amused looks on the faces of Jen-
kins and Evans —they lived on the floor
above Delgardie—as they passed me on the
stairs. Jenkins was saying “By Jove, that’ll
be a joke for the boys! Old Delgardie!
Great Scot!” This flitted back into my
memory later.
Finding Manuel’s door open, I pushed in
with a cheerful greeting. We were close
enough friends for me to make my entrance
without hesitation. I was well into the room
before I realised what was happening inside.
A girl had her arms around Manuel’s
neck and was pouring out a tide of passion
in which his name sang with a loving in-
flection every few words.
With a muttered apology, I turned back to
the door, only to be held by a cry from
Delgardie: “Stop! Don’t go away!”
As the cry held me hesitant, I nearly
burst into laughter, the cry was so like an
agonised call for help. Looking back at
them I saw that Manuel’s face was pale and
distressed —grotesquely so, considering the
prettiness of the girl holding him.
“No —go! Go quickly!” she commanded
imperiously.
“No, you must stay!” he almost yelled;
and the next moment he had shaken her off
and rushed at me, seizing my arms and
dragging me back into the room. “You go!
Go!” he said hoarsely to her.
For a moment it seemed to me that she
was determined to stay. There was an
awkward pause, Delgardie gripping my
arm, the girl just staring at us, with. I think,
hatred for me in her eyes. She relieved the
tension by suddenly going from us with a
sharp step.
Directly the door closed upon her Delgar-
die released my arm and slopped down at
the table in an attitude of piteous dejection.
“When you have passionate young ladies
like that in your flat, it’s as well to keep
your door closed,” I said; and the remem-
brance of the remark I had heard Jenkins
make flashed back to me. Obviously he and
Evans had seen or heard something in pass-
ing the door; it would certainly be a good
joke to tell about the shy recluse.
My remark was an inane one ; it was made
jocularly, to ease the strain; but it only
aroused a torrent of protest from Delgardie.
“Good God, man, you don’t suppose that I
brought her here, or wanted a scene like
that? She’s a girl I helped once; it wasn’t
much, but it came my way to do it, and it
probably seemed a lot to her. I think—l
think she is really fond of me. She has, time
after time —well, it doesn’t matter, but it's
rather a nuisance. I didn’t like to hurt her
feelings. To-night she came; before I real-
ised it, she was in here, going on—the way
you saw.”
His distress was so piteous to me that I
could only mutter that she was a very pretty
girl.
“She’s a living picture—that’s what it is.”
said Delgardie, passionately. “So’s Zarah!
I'm not; I’m only a phantom moving in a
world of living men and women.”
For a moment lie had me out of my depth ;
I fancied he was dragging me into the super-
natural ; an eerie feeling came over me, as if
he really was a mere phantom, recalling
queer thoughts I had had about him in past
days. Then he plunged into explanations.
“You must have noticed —everybody must
have noticed —how different I am from other
people. I have never wanted to make a
decision in my life, to face a crisis. Why,
even when it comes to having a holiday, I
find it positively painful to make up my
mind to leave my flat and my ordinary ways
and face a new place and new people. It’s
like an apprehension; I —l'm frightened.
I’m frightened of everything I'm not used
to doing. Love—l hate it! There’s respon-
sibility in it; the continuation of life. .. .
possibly. The risk of bringing a new life
into the world with all it may have to meet.!
God!”
I stared at him, thinking of Zarah. His
outpouring of confidence was so abject, too ;
at the same time so compelling of attention.
“I’m afraid of life, that’s what it is,”
THE IMPORTANT THING.
“Well, I hope she makes a do of it, but I don’t think she’ll get on while she paints
her face.”
“She will never get off if she doesn’t.”
he said. Then his voice sank into a fearful
whisper. “And I’m equally—or more—afraid
of death. I know some day I shall have to
die, and I lie awake shivering when I think
of it. I don’t say I don’t enjoy life ; I like
books and flowers, and art and the sun-
shine. But the people who are living and
have the desire to live, won’t understand.
They think I should want to live, too. In
the days of old a man like me would have had
a refuge. He could have become a monk, and
been given religious credit for his cowardice.
But I’m—well, I’m a Protestant for one thing,
and I can’t change. There are probably other
men like myself who would have been monks
in the old days, but haven’t any refuge like
that to-day. T tell you that, even if I wasn't
frightened of love and all it may mean. I
have never felt any warm inclination towards
a woman in my life, except my affection for
my mother and my sister.
“But.” I exclaimed, “Zarah”
“That's the hell of it, old man! I was
shamed into it. You know how lively my
sister is; how full of life” —he shivered —
“she is. With her, my disinclination to
fool with girls; my aversion to lovemaking
was a joke. For years she has been trying
to pair me off, never realising that it wa3 a
persecution. At last it was with Zarah.
She seemed to me a happy girl, enjoying
young life immensely, and in no hurry to
settle dowm to marriage. I judged that we
could simply become engaged, and then things
might go on for years.”
“Well, I should say your sister was right.
The sooner you do marry Zarah, and settle
down, the sooner you’ll get over all these
morbid ideas about yourself.”
“It was my attempt to bring the conversa-
tion down from the regions of the fantastic;
at the very moment I spoke I knew r that
the practical words as applied to a solution
of Dclgardie’s trouble were as fantastic as
the abnormal disposition he was describing
to me.
“Either I haven’t been able to show you
what I am, or you don’t mean that,” said
Delgardie. “I know now that Zarah is ex-
pecting to marry me soon; and there’s the
tragedy. She’s got into the way of regard-
ing me as her future husband; it’s going to
be ghastly breaking with her. But if I
marry her it will be marrying a warm,
breathing woman to a cold ghost.”
“But you’re not going to break with her!”
“No; they may drive me on —and I
haven’t resolution enough to suicide to get
out of it. But what does it mean? I had
an uncle who was shamed into a marriage
just as they are shaming me. He married
a woman who was warm-blooded, expecting
to be a wife and a mother. Her life was a
continual disappointment, his a humiliation,
a struggle against a positive aversion to all
that goes with matrimony, because he felt
he had done her a wrong in marrying her.
It was a miserable life for them both. I’ve
seen it in others of my family.”
His confidences were embarrassing me; I
would have liked to get away, but his piteous
call for sympathy held me.
“Rot!” I said. “This is a great deal
imagination. You’ve got in the habit of
brooding over your ideas of a family weak-
ness. There is your sister to show that it
doesn’t exist—a fine, full-blooded woman,
happy in her husband and her children.”
He looked up at me piteously.
“She isn’t my sister —only my half-sister.”
“Oil, shut up, man ; you mustn’t say things
like that!” I cut in, trying to check him;
but his words rushed out, as if, having torn
aside the mask by which lie had hidden the
shame of his tears and weaknesses lie
wanted to debase himself to the uttermost.
“I don’t blame my mother ; my father did
not blame my mother. He blamed himself.
She, too, was a warm, full-blooded woman,
very disappointed. A man came into her
starved life, full of the passion and lire my
father was incapable of showing. Also
unscrupulous. My mother subsequently con-
fessed to my father. My father was only
sorry; he only blamed himself; and Nell
was brought up as if she was my sister.
That’s the sort of thing that might happen,
too.”
By the time I left Delgardie the envy I
had once felt for him was swept away on
a tide of sympathy for the man. What
a life of misery he must have endured in his
fear of life! What a black problem was
facing him!
Before noon the next day I knew that
an avalanche was moving towards Delgardie.
The necessity of making a decision was to
be forced upon him; I realised fully now
how tragical it was to his nature to have
to make any decision. The story, as a joke
against a man regarded as absurdly sex-sliy,
had been spread about a girl being seen in
Delgardie’s Hat. It seemed to be regarded
as a specially juicy bit of amusing scandal.
The Sinclairs had, of course, heard about
it, and there were rumors here and there of
what they were going to do about it. A
great new pity for the undecisive Delgardie
faced with the anger of that family came
over nee.
That evening I went out to see Delgardie,
and found him in bandages.
“Bob Sinclair,” he said, with a sickly
grin. “He ‘beat me up’ for his sister’s sake.
I told him I thought it better I should not
marry Zarah. He didn’t wait for any
reasons.”
The grin gave me a hope for him ; but it
soon faded.
“You ought to have been a match for Bob
Sinclair,” I said. “It must have been a
Homeric affair.”
“It. was not,” he said; “he did all the
punching.”
“What! You let him thrash you like
that?”
“I felt in the wrong. Besides” His
shrug was helpless. It made me impatient.
“Well, the man who thrashes an unresist-
ing man wants to have a curb put on him.
The police”
“I couldn’t. I couldn’t make up my mind.
Besides, that’s over. If I’m going to marry
Zarah”
He must have seen my look of contempt,
which I couldn’t help, for he said: “Oh, I
wasn’t beaten into it. It was Zarah herself:
she came with Nell. She seems to have
some idea of how things are with me. She
knows I’m not a libertine; she told me that
she did not believe the stories about me.
She seemed to understand, and is prepared
to take the risk; we’re to be married in
three days.”
“So you decided”
“7 decided?” he laughed hollowly. “They
made up their minds that it was the best
thing for me. I think it was all Nell's
doing, as a matter of fact; with Zarah will-
ing to do anything that was for my good.”
“Well, she’s a woman any man would be
proud to marry,” I said heartily.
“I’m not a man; I’m a phantom,” he
answered, smiling wanly. “Anyway, even
now, the marriage may not take place. I
know of a monastery which I might enter —
if I could make up my mind.”
I felt glad that the thing was being rushed
so that Delgardie would be married before
he had time to make a decision—he would
require more than three days for that. Pos-
sibly he would never make an ideal hus-
band ; possibly Zarah would be disillusioned ;
but marriage would give him at least a
chance.
The mists had fallen when, that evening, I
walked over Princess Bridge, enjoying a brisk
walk to South Yarra in preference to hang-
ing on a crowded tram. At the Alexandria
Gardens end I noticed a crowd, and. following
the stream of it, went down to the river bank.
A weird group of shadows was working
there, and a torch flashed over a bundle of
sodden clothes and rested on the greenly-pale
face and staring eyes of Delgardie.
Then in an instant I realised the nature
of his monastery.
Hamer.
Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We take your mercy as our right—
And what are you?
A simple leaf of darkness
Between two flowers of blue.
A little soft indrawing
Between two sighs;
A sudden spit of silence
Between two seas of cries.

at the rate of 4-5 lb. seed per acre. Wim-
mera rye seed costs 9d.-ls. per lb., and
can be obtained from any of the leading Syd-
ney seedsmen. (Literature dealing with

Carpet-grass (Paspalum compression or
Durrington-grass) is a. very valuable fodder
in warm, sandy country with a good rainfall,
but it is not recommended for districts where
better grasses will grow. As its name implies,
it is a close, thick-growing variety. It would
not be suitable for Quirindi, but you could
try it on a small scale. Seeds can be
secured from Arthur Yates and Co., Ltd.,
184-186 Sussex-street, Sydney.

sess Victorian directories for so early a date.
Bailliere’s “Gazetteer of Victoria,” 1863,
mentions two breweries at Malmsbury, but
does not give the names of the owners. In
the 1866 directory three breweries are men-
tioned, Malmsbury Brewery Co. (Walter
Allen, manager), Matthew Johnson, and .T.
T. Toohey and Co. There is no mention of
John Clark in the directory.
/ have a self-portrait, of Adelaide Ironside.
Is it of value? —1949.
It would have a value from a sentimental
and historical standpoint only. Write to the
Mitchell Library, Sydney; they may be inter-
ested.
Wage and duties of a golf green-keeper in
N.S.W. when quarters are found"? —1917.
A foreman green-keeper on a course of
nine holes in N.S.W. has to be paid a mini-
mum rate of £4 17s. 6d. per week, and on a
course of IS holes or more, £5 ss. per week.
The amount to be deducted for a house or
quarters would have to be arranged with the
committee of the club concerned. Duties
include making and altering putting greens
and bunkers, maintaining putting greens and
fairways in good condition, weeding, seeding
and top-dressing as required, and the general
supervision of all other employees on the
course.
Cure for caterpillars on grape-vines? —
1980.
Try arsenate of lead spray. Mix 4oz. of
arsenate of lead powder to 10 gal. water.
If arsenate of lead paste is used then riiix
6oz. or 7oz. to 10 gal. water. Sometimes a
spreader of casein and slaked lime is added
to make the spray spread and adhere more
effectively. A leaflet “Spreaders for Sprays”
has been posted.
The correct flux to use ivhen soldering alu-
minium saucepans with ordinary solder? —
1888.
Metters, Ltd., recommend the following
method: The aluminium article should be
heated to an intense degree at the particular
spot to be soldered. Apply ordinary solder
and, when melted, rub vigorously into the
aluminium with a steel brush or similar
article. This operation will “tin” the sur-
face. After this has been done the spot to
be soldered should again be heated, but not
so intensely as in the first instance, and the
ordinary soft solder applied.
I have grown and dried some tobacco leaf.
llow can I bring out the aroma and flavor
to make it fit for home consumption? —l9s7.
Aroma and flavor are characteristics
imparted by the plant elements contained in
the soils on which the tobacco is grown, and
cannot be applied artificially, although the
flavor can sometimes be improved in the pro-
cess of manufacture. Manufacturing tobacco,
even for home consumption, is not permitted
by the Excise authorities without a license.
The fence dividing A and B’s property
(N.S.W.) has fallen into disrepair. Can A
call upon B to share the cost of putting it
in order again? —l96s.
A should call on B, in writing, to assist
in equal proportions to repair the dividing-
fence. If B refuses or neglects to do so for
six months after receiving this requisition—
without sufficient and reasonable excuse —
then in N. S. Wales A may employ somebody
to do the w T ork, and any money expended on
material or labor can be recovered from B.
I have occupied a block on a soldiers’
group settlement in N.S.W. under a Pro-
visional Allotment for over nine years. Being
without means, can I sue for a title in forma
pauperis ? —1763.
You are in occupation in accordance with
the provision of section 4 (b) of the
Returned Soldiers’ Settlement Act, 1916.
Sub-section 5 provides that an allotment by
the Minister of a block within a Group Pur-
chase area shall be subject to such condi-
tions as the Minister shall prescribe, and
shall not form a right of ownership to the
land and any improvements thereon. The
Lands Department’s view is that you cannot
hope to succeed in an action to direct the
Minister to confirm your allotment. The legal
opinion has been expressed in the case of
the Adjungdilly Shire Council v. Oliver that
an allottee is a tenant at will. Where an
allottee is anxious for a title and notifies
the department, steps will be taken to gazette
confirmation. The allottee must, howmver,
meet the department’s requirements in the
matter of execution of security documents to
provide for repayment of his indebtedness.
(1) What are the opportunities for a pro-
spector on Grawin (N.S.W.) opal-field? (2)
Is there water on the field? (3) Does a
miner’s right issued in Queensland hold good
for other States? —1848.
(1) The method of prospecting and mining
opal is simple. Shallow shafts are sunk,
most of which encounter thin seams of
“potch,” or inferior opal, which is of little
or no value, and levels are driven along the
“potch,” which occasionally give place to
patches of precious opal. Some of the pre-
sent prospectors at Grawin have done well
and many others have made more than wages.
At the time of the last departmental inspec-
tion about 150 men were on the field. (2)
The water supply is limited, but conditions
may have improved as a result of the recent
rains. (3) No.
Is there a catalogue of antiques, giving
marks, dates, signatures, etc.? —l7lo.
There is no general work, but an excellent
series of books (25 already issu'd) published
by Fisher Unwin (now Ernest Benn) en-
titled Unwin’s Chat Series, covers such sub-
jects as Old China, Old Clocks, Coins*,
Furniture, Old Silver, etc. They cost about
9s. 6d., and are stocked by leading book-
sellers.
What is the meaning of the Latin phrase
“Reddendo singula singulis"? —l99B.
Reddendo singula singulis, “giving each
to each,” is in law a rule of construction by
which particular words are assigned to other
particular words of an appropriate class.
Thus if in a statute appeared these words:
“If anyone shall draw or load any sword
or gun” the verb “draw” would be applied to
the substantive “sword” and “load” to the
word “gun.” This is a very simple example
but it illustrates the principle to be applied
in more complex collocations of words.
Where, can I obtain the “Official Year
Book” ? —1736.
The “Official Year Book of the Common-
wealth” can be obtained from Federal Gov-
ernment Printer, Melbourne, price ss. ;
“Official Year Book of N.S.W.” from Gov-
ernment Printer, Phillip-street, Sydney, clotn
7s. 6d., paper ss.
(1) Arc Cocos islands inhabited? (2)
Could they be purchased? —l967.
(1) The Cocos or Keeling islands consist
of a group of about 20 small coral islands.
Population in 1921 was estimated at 800.
(2) The islands are under the control of the
Straits Settlements. Information could be
obtained from the Colonial Secretary, Singa-
pore, Straits Settlements.
(1) Under N.B.W. Workers' Compensa-
tion Act, 1926, to what medical expenses is
an injured person entitled? (2) Is a. lump
sum settlement permissible? (3). What is
the limit of an employer’s liability? (4)
What will be the position in the event of
the Act being amended? —1933.
(1) Under section 10 of the Act of 1926,
a worker is entitled to hospital and medical
expenses reasonably required to relieve him
from the effects of the The cost to
the employer is limited to 150 unless the
Commission otherwise directs. _ If the ex-
penses of treatment exceed £5O and the
insurance company is unable to see its way
clear to pay in excess of this amount, the
worker is at liberty to apply to the Com-
mission for directions. (2) An employer
cannot redeem his liability to the worker by
payment of a lump sum without the con-
sent of the worker. Any lump sum redemp-
tion must be approved by the Workers’
Compensation Commission. (3) An employer's
liability by way of weekly payment is
limited to £lOOO unless the worker is totally
and permanently disabled. If such be the
case there is no limit to the employer’s lia-
bility. (4) It is not considered that any
amendment of the Workers’ Compensation
Act, 1926, would have a retrospective opera-
tion so as to affect the rights of a worker
who sustained injury prior to the date of
the amendment.
Is Beleek china of any value? —1977.
Beleek china is made in County Fer-
managh, Ireland, and has very little interest
for collectors. Originally made about 1865,
it has a ready sale, but does not command
big prices.
About 15 years ago 150,000 junior and
senior cadets in the Comomnwealth were
examined, and particulars regarding eyes ,
hair, etc., made the subject of an official
report. Where can I get the information? —
1985.
Try Commonwealth Statistician’s Office,
Canberra, F.T.
Where can I take a course of instruction
in bricklaying ? —2035.
Bricklaying is taught at Sydney Technical
College, Ultimo, to apprentices and journey-
men bricklayers. The lower trade course
occupies three years and the higher course
an additional two years. Students taking
trade courses pay 10s. per term, juniors ; 20s.
per term, seniors; or 255. juniors and 50s.
seniors per annum. A junior is a youth
under 21 receiving less than 30s. per week.
(1) Can a couple married in Scotland but
resident , in N.S.W. obtain divorce by mutual
consent, on the ground of incompatibility of
temperament? (2) Is it necessary for one
or both of the parties to be in Scotland io
obtain divorce under Scotch law? (3)
What is the least ground on which a couple
married in Scotland can obtain divorce in
N.S.W. ? —1982.
(1) Assuming N.S.W. to be the country
considered in law to be their permanenr
home they cannot get a divorce on the ground
of “incompatibility of temperament,” it not
being a ground for divorce in that State.
“Mutual Consent” does not affect the matter.
(2) Scotch law would have jurisdiction
only if domicile in Scotland could be
established, and divorce could be obtained
only on grounds recognised by it. (3) The
“least ground” in N. S. Wales is desertion
constituted through non-obedience of the
Court’s order for restitution of conjugal
rights.
1 have four engravings, Tam-o’-Shantcr —
(1) Are they a complete set? (2) What,
tvouid a valuation cost? (3) Address of an
art dealer? —1861.
(1) Impossible to determine their value in
the absence of complete information. The
engraver’s name on the pictures would help.
They may be only copies—a great many were
in circulation about 50 years ago. (2) Art
dealers generally charge 10s. 6d. or £1 Is.
If they are asked to dispose of the work they
generally waive this charge. (3) Lyster
Ormsby, 26 Hunter-street, Sydney.
(1) Have Australian and N.Z. stamps
issued in. the ’nineties or thereabouts any
value? (2) Address of stamp-seller who
would give a valuation? —1970.
(1) They would only be acceptable to a
deafer in quantity. The market value is
about 2s. 6d. per 100. (2) Fred Hagen,
114 Castlereagh-street, Sydney, or any other
reputable firm.
Have been troubled with grubs on tomato
bushes. The pest eats both green and ripe
fruit. What is the best spray?— lB39.
The trouble may be the moth caterpillar,
Tleliothis obsolete, which is a common pest
of tomatoes. Spray young to half-grown
tomatoes with arsenate of lead paste, lib.
to 20 gallons of water, or 9oz. of
arsenate of lead powder to 20 gal. water.
It may be necessary to repeat the spray a
fortnight later, and a third spraying may be
necessary. It would be advisable to add
a spreader or sticker to the spray consisting
of 11 fluid ounces of a solution made from
21b. resin, 11b. washing soda and two quarts
of water by boiling these three ingredients
until a clear brown solution is obtained.
Add 11 fluid ounces to each 20 gallons of
the arsenate of lead spray. If no rain fol-
lows the first application applied when the
tomatoes are half grown, the spray may
adhere sufficiently to obviate further spray-
ings for three weeks or more. It is important
to remove any arsenate of lead remaining on
the tomatoes when harvested by washing
and wiping.
This near my orange crop at, Carnarvon
(1K..4.) was attacked by a large moth. It
pierces the skin, sucks fh,c juice and
the oranges decay and fall off. Is there any
way of destroying the pest? —lB3s.
Probably the orange-piercing moth,
Ophideres spp. These moths have a wing-
expanse of up to 31 in. and a stiff, horny
proboscis with which they pierce the skin of
the orange. Some degree of control may be
obtained by the use of light traps or torches
at night. Communicate with the Govern-
ment Entomologist, Department of Agricul-
ture, Perth, sending him specimens of the
insect and a description of the damage. He
would then be able definitely to classify the
pest and recommend measures to deal
with it.
(1) Did a civilisation exist in England
prior to Roman rule? (2) What were the
races in Britain prior to the advent of
Cassar? (3) Has not Roman influence been
over-estimated in most histories?— lB9l.
(1) Civilisation existed in Britain prior
to the first Roman invasion. The inhabitants
used a native coinage, exported iron, traded
with the Continent ot Europe and excelled in
the fine art of enamelling on gold and silver.
(21 The list of tribes is a long one. Iberian,
Celtic and Teutonic elements existed in the
population. (3) Most historians accept the
Roman view. Roman culture had a strong
hold, but much which was distinctively
British, including the language, survived.

A CCIDENTS will happen!—and mostly when least
expected. The hot oven door—the slip of a knife
or the tin-opener—children’s falls. All these are
proper occasions for using Zam-Buk to grow new skin!
Wash away any dirt or grit from
the wound and cover with a piece
of lint or clean rag which has been
smeared liberally with Zam-Buk.
Burns and scalds need covering up
quickly to exclude the air. Then
leave Nature and Zam-Buk to do
the rest. In the case of bruises
and sprains, rub gently with
Zam-Buk.
Zam-Buk quickly soothes pain;
allays swelling and inflammation
and prevents the germs, present in
all wounds, from setting up fester-
ing or blood-poisoning. The
growth of new healthy skin pro-
ceeds apace, and the injury is
effectively and completely healed.
Zam-Buk is the ideal home first-
aid and skin remedy because
Zam-Buk means “safety first.”
Unlike ordinary ointments,
Zam-Buk is a highly refined balm
of herbal origin. It contains no

animal fat to clog the pores or

The V.R.C. had perfect weather for the
opening day of its greatest meeting, and the
enormous crowd witnessed some excellent
sport, turning it to financial profit in many
cases. Trivalve was the popular choice for
the Victoria Derby, and he was destined
to add his name to the honorable list of
dual Derby winners. He had done wonder-
fully well since his defeat by Avant Courier
in the Caulfield Guineas, and Scobie and
Lewis, partners in so many victories, were
very confident. But the price made many
small punters keep their money in their
pockets, for the bookmakers demanded 7 to
4. Avant Courier was next in request at
5 to 1 (he touched 4 to 1), Winalot being
at 6 to 1, Sacedon and Merry Mint at
twenties, Statesman at thirty-threes and
Leontes at fifties.
The seven runners gave no trouble at the
barrier, and the start was a good one. Avant
Courier dashed to the front immediately and
Daniels was able to ride “a waiting race in
front” for a few furlongs. But they were
going at their top as they passed the 5-fur-
long post; Avant Courier was then about
halt' a length clear of Merry Mint, with
Trivalve close up and Sacedon and Winalot
following. The Valais colt still had charge
in the straight, but below the distance Lewis
let the favorite go and it was all over.
Finishing full of running, Trivalve won by
three lengths from Statesman, who came
with a late run that surprised everybody,
owner-trainer Kelso included; Avant
Courier, who is clearly not a stayer,. was
third, a length away, with Merry Mint a
couple of lengths further backhand Sacedon
and Winalot next. Winalot’s form was
stones below that of the colt who ran those
great races in the Roseliill Guineas and the
A.J.C. Derby, after beating Aorangi at a
mile. Perhaps he w T as asked to do too much
at Randwick after his heartbreaking task in
the Derby.
But, when all is said and done, it was
a very fine performance on Trivalve’s part,
and the crowd gave all concerned a rap-
turous reception. Especially did it cheer
Bob Lewis, who had broken all records by
riding his eighth winner of the Derby.
Ernest Clarke, the owner, was not present,
but Scobie was on hand to receive congratu-
lations on having trained his seventh winner.
Slow as the pace was in the early part of
the race, Cyklon’s son completed the jour-
ney in 2min. 33sec.
The Maribyrnong Plate field was above
the average in point of quality; three of
the dozen runners—Ramulus, Mollison and
Belle Gallante —carried 101 b. penalties. Mol-
lison went out a 9-to-4 favorite; Martimah
was at 7 to 2, Ramulus 4 to 1, Salzacli 7
to 1 and Belle Gallante 12 to 1. Ramulus
was the early leader, but Mollison was in
front after they had gone a furlong, and
he was never again headed. Giving nothing
else a chance, he got home by a length from
Maid of the Nook (20 to 1), The Cad
(33 to 1) being a neck further away; Sal-
zacli, Ramulus and Martimah were next.
Daniels rode the son of Molly’s Robe, who
has not been defeated in three starts, and
the time was lmin. Olsec. E. M. Pearce’s
colors are popular, and there will be genuine
gratification if his Queensland-bred gelding
succeeds next year where Avant Courier
failed.
On the strength of his success in the W.
S. Cox Plate at Moonee Valley, Amounis
was a hot favorite for the Melbourne Stakes.
Five to four was the best price laid, and it
was evens when they were at the barrier.
Gothic, whom Sol Green fancied again, was
second choice at 3 to 1, and Silvius was
backed from 6 to 1 to 4 to 1, closing at
9 to 2. Pilliewinkie was at tens, and
Thracian at 15’s, Affirm, Vaiamita and Bac-
chus being at fancy prices. Affirm was
seen in his customary role of pacemaker, and
was a little ahead of Amounis and Silvius
entering the straight. At the distance, how-
ever, Amounis and Silvius had passed the
TOO SUDDEN.
WELLFED: “I remember going round these links in twenty-four — no; twenty-five.”
SKINNER: “ Caesar’s ghost!”
WELLFED: “Yes; nineteen-twenty-five.”
outsider, and from that stage they had a
most exciting tussle which ended in favor
of the English horse by a head. Gothic
came home well and was only half a length
behind the favorite; nor were Affirm and
Valamita disgraced—they finished fourth
and fifth respectively. Silvius got to the
end of the 10 furlongs in 2min. ssec., and
there is no getting away from the rare
merit of his performance. But old hands
questioned the wisdom of subjecting him to
so severe a test with Bst. 111 b. up two days
before the Cup. He is not really a four-
year-old by Australian time, and he has had
a lot of racing this season.
Jones, who rode a gruelling finish on Sil-
vius, had a much less arduous ride on Vaals
in the Cantala Stakes. Unluckily positioned
in the Toorak Handicap, the A.J.C. Epsom
winner had No. 3 marble on Saturday, and
Ned Moss and his friends and followers
put in the money to such purpose that the
Valais horse saw 2 to I—91 —9 to 2 had been
laid in places. Beauhania. who had finished
in front of Vaals at Caulfield, was at sixes,
Fuji San at eights and Herilda at tens;
Quan Tart (12 to 1), Tea Bell (14 to 1).
Mentellini, Cheosan, Reputed King and
Pigeon Pie (2(Tto 1) also had friends. Vaals
jumped away well, and was in front at the
seven-furlong post, but Metellus led into the
straight, Vaals being fourth. A furlong from
borne Vaals had them all settled, and, finish-
ing resolutely, he won by three-quarters of
a length from Trivalve’s brother, Treylou
(33 to 1), who made up a great deal of
ground; Beauhania was a good third and
Cheosan a close fourth, Metellus, Quan
Tart and Reputed King doing best of the
others. With his penalty Vaals carried
9st. 21b., and as he ran the mile in lmin.
37sec. his achievement was quite as good as
that of Amounis last year.
From the spectators’ point of view the best
race of the day was the Hotliam Handicap.
Windbag’s brother Bicolor, strongly fancied
for the Cup, was always favorite, 5 to 2 being
his closing price, but there was big money
for Eridanus, Devonshire and Killara (6 to
1). Son o’ Mine and Valorem (8 to 1), Bee-
dos and Tangible (10 to 1), while Imitator
(20 to 1) also had sporadic support. As
soon as the barrier lifted Piastoon took
charge, and he was still in the van half a
mile from home, where Devonshire ran into
third place behind Rawhetu. Killara also
improved a position which had been unfavor-
able ; rounding the home turn he was close
to Piastoon, Devonshire and Rawhetu. Kil-
lara hit the front below the distance, but
failed to sustain his long run, and the
onlookers shifted their gaze to Eridanus
(on the rails) and Bicolor, who were having
a great struggle. The judge could not separate
them, and he placed Valorem third, a neck
away; Imitator and Son o’ Mine (last
early) were very close to the third horse,
Killara and Piastoon being next. The race
was run so soundly that the timekeeper made
it 2min. 32|sec. Jones rode Bicolor, and it
was certainly a memorable day for him:
Scanlon was aboard Eridanus, who has done
well at Flemington.
The Silvius people left the securing of a
Cup rider for their horse till Saturday ; then
their choice fell on Ashley Reed, who is
very fortunate in these matters. Prior to
the Moonee Valley Cup, Kidman’s steed was
quoted at 12 to 1; then his price dropped
to fours, but he was a point longer at the
end of the week, Murillo disputing favorit-
ism with him. After his defeat of Amounis,
Silvius shortened to threes, and he was at
that pi'ice on the course, although some of
the bookmakers had him at 5 to 2. There
was a strong demand for Trivalve at 9 to 2
(4 to 1 in places), and Murillo was firm at
fives. At twelves and tens, Son o’ Mine was
also in request. “My horse is improving,”
said Sol Green; and he was right.
The race was another triumph for the
Scobie-Lewis alliance. Always kept in a good
position by Lewis, his veteran jockey, Tri-
valve justified the confidence of the stable
by downing the favorite and the 24 other
starters, and thereby gained a place in turf
history along with Patrobas (1915). Prince
Foote (1909), Poseidon (1906). Merriwee
(1899), Newhaven (1896), Grand Flaneur
(1880) and other great three-year-olds. The
sturdy son of Cyklon-Trey may not he the
eoual of wonders like Newhaven and Grand
Flaneur, but he is a splendidly game fellow,
this chestnut, and was in perfect condition
on the day, besides which there was a
thorough understanding between young horse
and veteran rider. But Silvius was not dis-
graced. He did much better than Ruenalf,
Lancaster and Luke Foote, other lightly-
weighted winners of the Melbourne Stakes.
Whether he wouldn’t have done better still
without that trying race in the Stakes is a
ouestion that has been, and will continue to
be, discussed throughout Australia, though
uiscusaiou is now useless; certainly the cam-
paign mapped out for him was exceptionally
severe. Son o’ Mine oroved himself a.
thorough stayer. “Length; two lengths; 3
min. 24 sec.,” was the verdict.
* * * *
“Murkah”: A half-dozen years ago the
Melb. Cup result reached Sydney in 10 sec.,
and 30 secs, later it crackled in Cairns and
Darwin. That was before broadcasting. On
Tuesday even as Trivalve galloped past the
post his name covered the earth. Not only
this: listeners the world over were able to
follow the “story” of the race and hear the
tornado of roars. With a 4-k.w. push the
information instantly left Australia on a
SSI-metre wave-length, which means an oscil-
lation period of 10 millions per second. This
prodigious frequency had such a penetrating
effect on the ether that energy, and to spare,
reached London and New York; there it was
instantly re-flung across the continents. And
since sound is as slow as an aged caterpillar
compared with the globe-encircling rush of the
mysterious ether-wave, thousands of Britons,
Canadians and Yanks knew the result as
soon as anyone at Flemington, and before
that large proportion which did not actually
see the finish.

Carlita’s daughter Woolita, now in her
third season on the turf, won her first race
on Saturday—the Kogarah Stakes at Moore-
field. Her success, at Bto 1, started a good
day for Findlay, the Newcastle jockey, who
rode three winners, but the generality of
punters went down in every race except,
perhaps, the first division of the Flying
Welter, which went to Factor (5 to 2), the
second favorite. Clandulla’s victory (at 12
to 1) in the second division, and those of
Tribute (12 to 1) and Burr Cross (12 to
1) in the divided Three-and-Four-Year-old
Handicap, were particularly annoying to
punters. Zuleika, second (at 9 to 2) to
Factor, was brought out again in the St.
George Handicap and, starting at the same
price, won, running away, from Gipsy King
(20 to 1) and White and Black (14 to 1).
She is owned and was imported by Dick
Wootton, whose good-hearted policy of put-
ting his apprentices up on all occasions was
thus rewarded, after many failures. Night
Heron (5 to 1) made light of his task in
the Moorefield Handicap, wherein Hinchin-
brook (7 to 1) and Blaircourt chased him
home at respectable distances; Blaircourt’s
jockey failed to weigh in and Young George
(12 to 1) was placed third. Teddy Keys
seems to have got Night Heron back into
the fine form he showed the season before
last, and the hardy customer should be worth
following during the next few weeks.

Sum King stays pretty well, as also does
his younger brother Amusement, and with
7st. 111 b. in the Queensland Cup Ryan’s
horse should have a decided chance. He
was given 7st. 7lb. in the Metrop., where
the company was much more select. As a
tliree-year-old, with 7st. 71b., he was a good
second to Piastoon in the Queensland Cup,
and he seems to have returned to form.

“Mars”: Even in S. Aus., the tote, which
is the only legal means of doing in a coupla
bob, has its opponents. I heard one of them
holding forth on our way back from a recent
meeting. “Wot we want ’ere is the books,”
lie growled, glaring round the railway car-
riage. “The tote’s no good—it’s daylight
robbery! Every flamin’ race it takes 74
p.c. for the club and 5 p.c. for the Gover’-
ment —that’s 12£ p.c. on each race. To-day
they was eight races, and everybody knows
that eight times 124 p.c. is 100 p.c.—between
’em, the Government and the clubs take the
whole bloomin’ lot.” And apparently a num-
ber of his hearers could see no flaw in the
argument. _ ...

A RUEFUL RUBAIYAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Listen again. A morning I arose
Like one on whom the sun of reason glows,
But reason’s sun forgetting straight I
went
Where the lay population stands in rows.
Indeed, indeed, repentance oft before
I swore—but I was losing when I swore;
And then and then came Spring and, Cup
at hand,
For Flemington I yearned just as of yore.
For though the horses I have loved so long
Have done my credit in men’s banks much
wrong,
And made me sip from many a bitter Cup,
Desire to taste again, I found, was strong.
And, truth to tell, among that bookish set
I felt old habits harder to forget,
As suddenly one more impatient cried —..
“Who is the bettor, pray, and what the bet’? ’
Then said another, “Surely not in vain
My clerk and I from our soft beds were ta’en,
That all the wealth we’d willingly disgorge
Should still oppress us on the homeward
train!”
Then said a punter with a long-drawn sigh,
“Each system fails me, whatsoe’er I try;
But here is money for the taking, and
I’ll pick a winner.. .maybe...by-and-bye.”
So while they wavered, this and that way
swaying,
One spied the certainty that all were praying;
And then they jogged each other, helter-
skelter,
To gather in the odds that w r ere a-laying.
Alas, that hope should wither as the rose!
That “books” of spring on winter gains
should close!
The lying bird that of his certs did sing,
Ah, whence and whither flown again, who
knows ?
Ah, love! could thou and I the power boast
To grasp this sorry horse from out the host,
Would not we lift it upon wings—and then
Replace it nearer to the winning post!
But when some wight with pointed lance
shall pass
Among the tickets scattered on the grass,
And on his tidy errand reach the spot
Where I made one — mine will be there,
alas!
VICTORIA.

“Don Crew”: When Cracker hoisted his
boy aboard the favorite he gave the lad some
instructions. “See that bit of rag?” he saia,
pointing to a flag that floated above the bark-
roofed grandstand. “If it’s still at the top of
the pole when the starter says ‘go,’ grab hold
of your ’orse. If I want you to win 111
joggle it down to half-mast. Unnerstand?”
Some minutes later, having backed his steed
right off the map, Cracker crossed over to the
flagpole and gave the boy the hurry-up signal.
He had barely completed the job when a
steward appeared from nowhere. “Here,
wl.o’s been fooling with this flag?” the official
asked. Invoking curses on the offender’s head,
lie hauled it up to the top again. Then the
long loud peal of the bell annoimced that the
starter had sent the field on its journey.

“Persimmon”: “Gilpin” asks whether the
modern racing seat is the correct one (B.
22/9/’27). Some of the best English autho-
rities still hold the opinion that it is not.
Dick Marsh, the crack Newmarket trainer,
is emphatic in his objections: —
It was urged years ago in favor of the American
seat that it enabled the weight to be thrown more
forward. As to that I defy anyone to saddle a
horse except in the place intended by nature to
receive the saddle. I was always taught to ride a
comfortable length, neither too long nor too short.
In that way you were given the power, which is so
essential, and the sense to know every movement of
your horse, whether tiring, wanting balancing or
merely running lazy. You could stick to your horse’s
head and help him to give of his best, instead of
which the crouching short-leathered rider only knows
that he is not winning if he does not happen to be
in front.
The foregoing is from Marsh’s very interest-
ing book, “A Trainer to Two Kings.”
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Merv. Williams, who has beaten real front-
rankers and yet never seems to be acknow-
ledged as first-class himself, met Tommy
Mclnnes. the Scottish middleweight, at the
Sydney Stadium on Friday night. The pugs
came in at list. 41b. apiece and provided a
lot of excitement. Mclnnes is a plugging
rusher who appears to possess a heavy punch ;
but he had little chance of demonstrating
this, for Williams hit with both hands and
“claimed” the slower Scot in a way calcu-
lated to drive even the phlegmatic Caledonian
wild as well as stern. Disdaining Mac.’s
body rips and jabs, Merv. scored continu-
ally with straight lefts and right crosses, so
much so that as early as the fourth round
Tommy looked like taking the count. One
hook to the chin had him very wobbly on his
pins and uncertain whether he was in Syd-
ney or Glasgow. If the Australian had *then
stood off and banged his always-surprising
two-handed battery home, “Scotty” would
have been out to the world there and then;
but Williams lost time by claiming and
twisting his man into position, and the tough
Scot recovered. Mclnnes had Merv. very
worried in the fifth by his dogged attack.
From that on, however, the Australian had a
lot the better of matters. In the 13th he
dropped Mac. for eight with a. right uppercut
to the point, and put him down again in the
14th. But “Scotty” fought fast and game in
the final round, and Joe Wallis reckoned
he’d earned a draw. There v/as a fairish
house.

“Centurion”: The Australian amateur
boxing and wrestling championships, held in
Sydney, brought to light at least one Olym-
pic possibility in T. H. Morris, the middle-
weight wrestler from Victoria, which State
captured the Corbett Memorial Shield.
Morris’s display against C. I. Gale (N.S.W.)
in the final was decidedly clever, and the
young man has obviously profited by his
opportunities for studying the work of Tliye,
Clapham and Miller. Willis, the Sydney
featherweight, who beat Fred Kay’s brother
in a heat and a tough Queenslander, F. Doe-
soil, in the final, was the most promising
exhibit among the bruisers. But Barling
(N.S.W.) and Palmer (Vic.), who con-
tested the final of the welterweight division,
are both likely lads; Palmer, who was
beaten by the other boy’s straight left, is
only 16.

“Mitt Shover”: Tom Heeney, the Maori-
land heavyweight who found it so difficult to
get engagements in this country, has won
another good fight in New York. Ilis
opponent was one Johnny Risko, and Heeney
gained a clear-cut decision on points. The
scrap is described as one of the bitterest seen
for years, Risko roughing and fouling per-
sistently, but in spite of this the Maori-
lander gave his opponent a father of a past-
ing. Heeney has probably improved a lot
since the Stadium experts failed to see any
virtue in his boxing, but it must be said for
the American promoters that they gave him
every encouragement, instead of labelling him
a dud after one perfunctory trial. All going
well, he will meet Tunney next year.

The clash of Walter Miller (12st. 41b.)
and Mike Yokel (12st. 91b.) at Melb. on
Saturday night, was so unexciting that the
back-seaters became restless and urged the
principals to do something. It was not until
the fifth round that the first fall was re-
corded, Walter securing it by means of what
is known in the argot of the mat as a
“jack-knife splits.” The sixth and seventh
were weary affairs, and many of the spec-
tators had left the building before Mike
secured his fall in the last round with a step-
over toehold. “A draw,” said Bridges, and
what was left of the never-numerous crowd
went home.
The Ins and Outs
The Maorilanders, fresh from their Eng-
lish visit, opened the big-cricket season on
Friday with a match against N.S.W. -at
Sydney Cricket Ground. They lost the toss,
and N.S.W. piled on runs at such a rate that
the visitors’ attack was soon demoralised,
while the fielding went to pieces. The
side’s big score of 571 took only 278 minutes
to compile. Gregory’s share was 152, made
in whirlwind style; Andrews, after a shaky
start, finished with 184; Kippax played a
stylish knock for 119, and young Jackson s
104 was very brisk and attractive. Merritt,
a slow break bowler with an occasional
“wrong ’un,” was the most successful trund-
ler, with 5 wickets for 210 ; he was unfor-
tunate in the matter of dropped catches.
Henderson, a fastish righthander, also re-
vealed possibilities. James kept wickets in
fine style till an injury compelled his retire-
ment.
The visitors soon showed themselves bats-
men of class. But luck was against them
again, for after a confident opening Mills
slipped, in trying to hook Everett, and broke
his wicket. Dempster ran on attractively to
32; Page (38) went to a red-hot catch by
Mailey off his own bowling; Blunt was
caught in the slips off McNamee for a mas-
terly 63; Lowry, who had figured iu an
interesting stand with the much-improved
Blunt, fell to the Everett-Oldfield combina-
tion at 43. Dacre, the dasher of the side,
left when he had made 10—Oldfield again.
Allcott, a sound, hard-hitting lefthander,
made an excellent impression in collecting
43. The innings closed for 286. Gregory,
with 2 for 27, had the best average, and
young O’Reilly, specially tried for his bow-
ling and not utilised till well on in the
innings, took 2 for 37.
In the tourists’ second innings there was
another good stand by Blunt (53) and
Lowry (35). Then Dacre (54) and Page
(51) put on 50 in 21 minutes; Dacre
reached his 50 in 38 minutes —a brilliant
knock. The innings defeat was saved by a
good last-wicket stand by Merritt (22) and
i-lenderson (25 n. 0.), which brought the total
to 292. The necessary runs were got in
peculiar fashion, there being seven leg-byes
and a bye. Gregory (3 for 40) had the best
N.S.W. average.

for he had a painful argument with quinsy
in Sydney, though he rose from a sick bed to
make his first Test century.

“Archaeologist”: People who are fond of
computing the age of buried cities by the
depth of the debris which covers them may
take a lesson from a recent happening in
Brisbane. A concrete wicket was being laid
down in one of the city’s outlying parks,
when another one, in fairly good condition,
was found four feet below the surface. As
there was no evidence of Greek or Roman
or even Polynesian origin, the forgotten pitch
must have been a construction of yesterday
at the most. Yet there was four feet of soil
over it, and no one could recall its history.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury” : Ckicket, which is run by
Australia’s old friend “Plum” Warner,
recently mentioned that Liverpool had hon-
ored the memory of famous Australian
cricketers by naming streets after Spofforth,
Murdoch and Bannerman. Sydney, it added,
had returned the compliment by calling one
of its principal thoroughfares Wynyard-
square after Major Wynyard, the Hamp-
shire cricketer, though the Major had never
visited Australia. In point of fact, Wyn-
yard-square, -street and -lane took their titles
from Colonel W T ynyard, Commandant of
British troops in N.S.W. before the Hamp-
shire amateur was born. Still, it wasn t a
bad shot, for the earlier Wynyard was a fore-
bear of the cricketer—a great-uncle, if
memory serves aright.
Racquet and Bawl
The exhibition matches staged by the
N.S.W.L.T.A. at Ruslicutter Bay last week
provided a feast of good tennis. J. O. Ander-
son, making his first appearance on grass
courts in Sydney for nearly 12 months,
showed at his top on Friday; he defeated N.
Peach (6 4, 6-1) in the opening singles,
and, partnered by O’Hara Wood, took the
doubles from Jim Willard and Hopman (7-5,
7- The surprise of the day was the
defeat of Hopman by R. 0. Cummings (6-0,
8- the youngster making a hard bid for
the second set. On Saturday, Crawford, who
had made a very indifferent showing at
Strathfield, showed a surprising return to
form in beating Anderson 7-5, 1-6, 6-2. The
youngster dealt with Anderson’s cannon-ball
service in the most confident fashion, taking
the first four games in succession and show-
ing great severity in his own strokes. Ander-
son rallied well in the second set, but wilted
a bit in the third ; on the other hand, Craw-
ford’s game increased in severity as he went
on. There was also some fine play in the
doubles between Crawford and Hopman and
O’Hara Wood and .T. Willard, the former
couple winning 6-8. 6-2. 6-4. Crawford had
another win, with Miss Akhurst, in the mixed
doubles. Miss Akhurst was at the top of her
form on both days.
“Cut Shot” : There will be another series
of exhibition matches in Sydney on Decem-
ber 9 and 10, when the first of several Davis
Cup trials will lend added interest. A big
entry is expected here and at the subsequent
trials in Melbourne on January 13 and 14.
All going well. Patterson and Hawkes will
take part in these tests, as also will Rowe
(South Aus.), Crawford, Hopman, Ivalms,
Jim Willard and Cummings (N.S.W.) and
Moon (Queensland).
The Nineteenth Hole
The new professional golf champion of
N.S.W. is Walter Clark, the Killara club’3
pro., who beat 11. R. Sinclair in the final at
Rose Bay by four up and two to play. Clark
did the morning round in 74, his opponent
taking two strokes more. Each did the out-
ward journey in the afternoon in 37, and the
game see-sawed to the thirtieth. Sinclair had
a chance of gettting up here, but missed the
easiest of putts and lost the hole. Then he
found a bunker at the thirty-fourth, and it
took him two to get out. Clark had placed
his approach dead on the pin, and Sinclair,
recognising that his position was hopeless,
surrendered the hole. Sinclair played some
brilliant shots, but his iron play, which had
been uncommonly good during the earlier
rounds, showed a falling off in the final. Clark
was a model of consistency throughout the
tourney; he was particularly steady on the
green. This is his first big win.
* ** *
“Ploughman”: The Brisbane Newspaper
Co. has resolved to offer a silver cup for
annual competition among the caddies.
Two caddies who have been carrying clubs
for 12 months at least may be nomin-
ated by a club belonging to the Queensland
Association. The winner will receive a gold
medal, and his name will be inscribed on
the cup; moreover, cash prizes will no
doubt be forthcoming from private donors.
Many clubs in Queensland and other States
hold similar competitions, privately, but this
is believed to be the first event of its kind
to be recognised officially. Two of the
finest players Australia has produced, Joe
Kirkwood and Toni Howard, have risen from
the ranks of the bag-carriers.
* ** *
“Hoylake”: England is turning from the
veterans of golf and looking for represen-
tatives in the ranks of youth. It is sus-
pected that something good in that line has
been discovered in the person of Charles
Ellis, 17 years old and 14 stone in weight.
Ellis is the lad who was roundly hooted in
the final of the Scottisli-Englisli schoolboy
tourney in Scotland because he claimed a
point of law which he was entitled to do.
He is said to be improving out of sight under
careful coaching; already he is rated one
of the longest drivers in Britain. As the
long game counts for so much nowadays,
Ellis may prove a champion if he can show
similar improvement in other departments of
the game.
:j: * •!=
“Divot Digger”: The very latest Queens-
land golf course is situated at Ilumpybong,
a salubrious seaside spot which has long
been the standby of the low comedian when
he visits McCormack's capital. What Wigan
is to the English music-hall performer and
Footscray to the Victorian funny man in
search of a laugh so is Ilumpybong to the
stage jester in Brisbane. Undeterred by the
additional opening for gibes that addiction
to golf may bring them, the Ilumpybong
people are constructing a nine-hole course
which is later to be extended into the full
nineteen.
* ** +
“The Mcllaggis”: It is not often that a
player of games can leave his particular
obsession for a generation and show promise,
on returning to it, of regaining his best form.
This is particularly true of golf, yet an
instance is being quoted in British golfing
circles of the thing happening. Five and
twenty years ago a Scottish golfer lost his
b a ll_ on 'e of the then new and expensive
rubber-cores. It was recently found in cir-
cumstances which admitted no doubt of its
identification. Its owner is showing aston-
ishing proficiency considering his long
absence from the game.
* ** *
“Centurion”: I have been reading Abe
Mitchell’s book, recently published, “The
Essentials of Golf.” The admirable treatise
will be interesting to all players, but those
with a style formed —or malformed —will be
well advised to think twice before accepting
Abe’s conclusions as to the imperative neces-
sity for the forward and lateral hip move-
ment, as he outlines it. In other respects,
Mitchell’s theory of golf follows the lines
laid down by the masters who have gone
before him. One wonders whether all this
elaboration of style is worth-while. The new
American school is ignoring all the old pre-
cepts, save those which are fundamental in
all games which consist in hitting a ball
with some implement or other. They do not
seem to be suffering much as a result of their

“Exhaust”: Major Seagrave’s motor re-
cord of 203.74 m.p.h. for a mile is not to be
allowed to stand if the Yankees can help it.
Daytona Beach, where: these speed tests are
usually staged, is ambitious of bringing the
record back to America; and there are re-
ports that Dusenberg and Miller, America’s
leading motor-car designers, are concentrat-
ing on a machine which will blow the Sun-
beam’s figure sky-high. The building of a
cai to travel at a high speed does not seem
t 0 ue a difficult task. The job is to drive it
and hold it straight when travelling at such
a tremendous rate as that achieved by the
Englishman.
“Main Range”: Queensland R.A.C. held a
petrol-consumption test at Toowoomba last
week. Rain had made the route originally
mapped out over the range dangerously slip-
pery, and another course had to be chosen
Even then competitors were sliding all over
the place; YV. G. Webb, who finished with

was bogged. The private-car section was
won by Miss E. E. Carter, of Brisbane, who.

the first place for ton mileage with 70.17
and also the mileage per gallon, 51.5. In

Toowong”: Brisbane Motor-cycle Club
lias completed a 24-hour reliability trial—the
first for several years in the northern capital.
1 he trial was held over a circuitous and verv
trying route ; nevertheless, five of the 19 com-
petitors scored the maximum number of
points, 500—very good going. The lowest
figures on the list were 445, and half a
dozen riders were inside the 490’s. The
leading five were: B. Unwin (Indian, solo)

Miscellaneous
Following on their draw with London, the
vyaratails slipped in the mid-week match
with Oxford University; they were beateu
o-O—a try to nothing. It was their own
fault for taking Oxford too cheaply. The
ground was wet, and, keeping the ball down,
the students got home against a side con-
fauung only four players of the team that
Juid drawn with London. Malcolm, the New-
castle half, was off in the second spell with
a dislocated shoulder, but that is hardly an
exhuse for what looks like general slack-
ness. The lesson did the Australians good,
for on Saturday they beat Leicester, one of
the strongest of the Midland clubs, by 20
to 8 4 tries, 2 converted goals and a
dropped goal (by Ross) to two tries and
a converted goal.
* * * *
“Adsum” : The attendances at the Wara-
tahs matches seem very modest compared
with the crowds at the Soccer games in the
same localities. At Cardiff, once the preserve
” Rugby Union, 35,000 saw a Soccer League
tussle; at Portsmouth, another erstwhile
Rugby stronghold. 25.000 were at a Soccer
League game. On the third Saturday in
September First Division Soccer matches
drew from 20,000 to 55.000 and Second Divi-
sion from 18,000 to 40,000. Even the min-
nows (3rd) saw nothing less than 10 000-
one actually topped 30,000.
. * * * *
Centurion”: It was to be expected that
the criticism of the Waratahs bv the verv
superior section of the English press
devoted to sport not “sporting* press,” for
Heaven s sake would make interesting
reading. It does. The Field, which ponder-
ously reviews the world’s sport from tiger-
shooting to table tennis, has a few words
of reproof to bestow on th e “colonials.”
The idea of the half-back cutting through
the broken scrum fills it with such rage and
disgust that one suspects he scored a trv bv
doing so, though the move in Rugby is older
and more moth-eaten than the Field —and
that is saying a lot. But we get the real
ditliyrambics when the Field comes to the
Australian custom of dressing the touch
judges in white sweaters and shorts. The
object is to distinguish the officials from the
sprinkling of nondescripts who usually
haunt a football touchline, but not in this
light does the Field regard it. No; the
hideous lapse from conventionality “failed
to meet the views of spectators who abhor
anything suggesting the practice of the
professional.” So there, now!
* * * *
“Splash”: Every week or so the cables
announce that someone or other has swum a
distance faster than someone else did the
week before. No details are ever given as to
circumstances, but these are important, for
times, to be accepted by the International
Federation, must be put up in actual con-
tests and under special conditions as to
water and so forth. Weismuller and Borg
figure in most of the dreary reports. First,
Borg swims 300 yards in “world’s record”
time. Next, Weissmuller knocks several
seconds off that. Then Johnny gets over the
half-mile in 10 min. 22 1-5 secs. Arne
comes along and cuts this down to 10 min.
14 secs. Never a word as to whether the
deed was done in fresh or salt water, who
took the time, or anything like that. As
far as the half-mile and longer distances go,
it is pretty safe to say that neither Weiss-
muller nor Borg would ever see the way
Andrew Charlton was travelling, however
gaudy their times may appear.
*•* '■* •!’ sjs
“F.S.”: Melbourne is to have dog-racing
after all, and in an utterly indefensible spot.
A. company calling itself Sporting Prop.,
Limited, asked for a lease of the Exhibition
Oval, and the trustees, after swearing that
they would ne’er consent, foolishly con-
sented. The barking of the animal arid the
yelling of the human pack will be painfully
audible at the Children’s Hospital and other
private sick bays in the neighborhood, but
that is a side-issue when the public need for
more diversion is involved.
* * *
“C.Q.”: A form of tin-hare coursing has
arrived in East Melbourne. The local small
boys tie a string to a jamtin, and drop the
string down the cable-tram slot until it
engages in the cable. The tin tears off at
20 miles an hour with the dogs in hot pur-
suit, while their cheering :owmrs lay their
last trouser-button on the result.
* * * *
“Robbo”: As a result of the dog-racing
mania, greyhounds are getting so hard to
buy in Britain that other varieties of dogs
which hunt by sight, as opposed to scent,
are being experimented with. The latest
addition to the list of possibles is the Borzoi,
a leggy, hairy beast of Russian origin. It
is alleged to be used in the land of its birth
for chasing wolves, but ever since it appeared
in England, 30 years ago, it has never been
anything but a “show-bench dog.” Which is
tantamount to saying that'it is quite worth-
less for practical uses.
* * * *
“FY7”: The monkey-sweep man of old-
time Randwick (B. 20/10/’27) had his
counterpart at the western shows and race-
meetings in Queensland when we were all
ERIC CON NOLL Y, who had Murillo
going for a fortune in the Melbourne
Cup.
a bit younger. Occasionally a temperamental
monkey would hurl the marble into the
crowd, instead of delivering it up to his boss
for the usual manipulation. As this meant
a pay-out for the proprietary, it wms not
infrequent to see the offending monk.
spanked coram puhlico, and occasionally a
sentimental drunk would offer battle on
belialf of the pore dumb animal. One famous
practitioner of those days was an original
genius. His marbles were drawn from the
barrel by a large goose, dyed a rich blue. He
disdained to put up the transparent bluff
of handling the marble and calling the
number of his buttoner; whenever he thought
it was his turn to score—and that was pretty
often—the goose would swallow the marble.
After railing at the fowl for his greed, the
owner of the joint would opine that there
was no help for it, and start issuing another
batch of tin tickets. How he gave the goose
“the office” no one ever found out, though
both wily birds were watched unwinkingly
for hours at a time.
* * * *
‘‘Spike”: Pleading poverty, the N.S.W.
amateur athletic heads have announced that
they may not be able to send a team to
J. O. ANDERSON, former Davis Cup
representative, who showed flashes of
his best form in .exhibitions against the
leading amateurs in- Sydney last week.
Maoriland for the Australasian champion-
ships, though the cost would be £2OO at the
most. With the Olympic Games in view, tin-
visit, with its experiences, would prove of
the utmost value in deciding the calibre of
N.S.W. aspirants for Olympic selection, apart
from the duty owed to Maoriland. Consider-
ing the number of its members, and the ex-
tensive patronage it enjoys, the Athletic
Association should be able to whip up what,
after all, is a trifling sum to a sporting
organisation of its prestige. One does not
hear of Victoria or Queensland missing such
an important meeting on the score of
economy.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: Victoria, which seems to
be the last refuge of the professional “ped,”
is to be the scene of a “world’s sprint
championship.” The promoters, who intend to
stage the show at Melbourne Motordrome,
have isssued a circular stating that entry
will be by invitation, and that one runner
will be selected to represent each State and
overseas country taking part; who is to do
the selecting and inviting is a detail left
to the imagination. Respecting prizes, £l5OO
is to be distributed during a fortnight; the
prize for the “championship”—it is to be
decided on the result of four races over 75,
100, 180 and 220 yards—is £l5O and a gold
cup. This doesn’t seem likely to attract
a horde from overseas. It -was hardly worth
while to pull out a good man for that amount
of money in a North Queensland Carring-
ton 30 years ago, even for one flutter; and
£l5O would have bought a lot more then.
* * * *
“Half Butt”: Many attempts have been
made to improve the spectacular side of bil-
liards, as played by professionals. Melbourne
Inman has got into the limelight again with
a reversal of the order of the hazard values,
those off the white counting three and the
red losers two. Inman has engaged in a
match with Carpenter under the new scoring
method with the idea of popularising it.
An innovation which might well be adopted
is the abolition of the rule which keeps
the potted white off the table till the man
who has potted it breaks down. The loss
of the ball is usually a handicap to the
player in hand, and one which, often, he
does not deserve. The accidental pocketing
of the white, for instance, cuts the cannon
shot right out of the remainder of the break.
There seems no reason why the white ball,
so sunk, should not spotted, as in the
case of the potted red. Such a change
would make the game more open and much
faster, even for “mugs.”
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Yeulba”: The extent of the recent raid
on the fur-bearing animals of Queensland
is evident in the manifest of the steamer
Canadian Britisher, now en route to Ameri-
can ports; it carries 300 bales of native-
bear skins alone, valued at over £lOO,OOO.
The cargo is the most valuable of its kind
ever shipped from Queensland, and there
were several previous shipments.
*'**.-#
“C.Q.”: The practice of buying German
pianos has received another set-back, this
time at St. Arnaud (Vic.). The trustees of
the local soldiers’ memorial hall bought one
of the articles. Thereupon the R.S.L. passed
a resolution to the effect that, unless the
offending instrument was removed, the words
“Soldiers’ Memorial” would have to be re-
moved from the title of the hail. Members
capped tliis by intimating that they would
have their own names deleted from the
tablets.
$ * * *
“Lorio”: It has long been known that
the essential oil of the Huon pine contains
valuable medicinal properties; it has been
used with good results in obstinate cases of
pyorrhoea. A new industry is springing up,
and at the present time three stills are
operating on Macquarie Harbor (Tas.), with
more in prospect. The pine-sawyer considers
£1 per ton for sawdust and 15s. for “edgings"
easy money. Incidentally, Iluonpine-oil
is the only known oil which is distinctly
heavier than water.
* * * *
“Jim Lynch” : Despite alleged defects the
locos, introduced to S.A. by Kail Chief Webb
are performing creditably on long-distance
runs. One “Mountain” type will handle
Melbourne expresses between Adelaide and
Serviceton. Leaving Adelaide at 4.30 p.m.
the same engine will return to Adelaide at
nine the following morning, running 392
train miles in 12£ hours. Four crews will
handle the engine on the round trip, and
economy will be reflected in increased
mileage per engine hour and reduced number
of engines through sheds.
❖ ❖ *
“Zirk” : I should like to meet those Nortb-
Westralians mentioned by “Trampas” (B.
29/9/’27) who have put shark-fishing on a
profitable basis. A Broome pearler had till
recently a few niggers employed catching
shark. There was plenty of shark, but very
little profit. lie tried dugong—and has many
barrels of oil which he is unable to sell.
He got a fleet-owner interested in diving
boots made from shark and dugong leather.
But trouble with the colored men chased all
thoughts of new diving boots out of the fleet-
owner’s mind, and another possible source of
income to the Carnarvon works remains to
be exploited.
* * * *
“N.F.”: In few countries is waste so wide-
spread as in Australia. Scrap material, for
the most part, is thrown aside, to rot or
rust. Only a fraction of the iron scraps is
gathered and re-smelted, and innumerable
little broken gadgets of copper, brass and
various alloys find their way to the incin-
erator or the ocean bottom rather than to
the metal-buyer. Machinery that has passed
beyond use is allowed to fall to pieces, its
residual value notwithstanding. And the
quantities of good food that, go into the
rubbish bin ! This wastefulness is not only
bad economically; it leaves its trace on the
individual character.
* * * *
“No Hope”: John C. Wishmann, a Cali-
fornian chemist, has patented a process for
making rubber from priekly-pear. Wish-
mann may have hit upon som e new method
of conversion, but his idea was blown to a
bubble by Queensland experimenters, who
long ago dreamed of making the world’s
motor tyres out of Australia’s greatest
vegetable pest. The experiments all came
to a dead end. There were others whose
elastic imaginations saw fortunes in the ex-
traction of rubber from Moreton Bay fig-trees.
One lot of hopes smashed, the fig-tree enthu-
siasts thought they had solved the problem
of cheaper chewing-gum. That aspiration,
too, proved a dud.
* * * *
“Bowser”: The petrol-pump, with a pretty
girl in a musical-comedy version of a chauf-
feur's uniform to attend it, is a familiar
sight in any Australian city. Until recently
the only Australian-made thing about the
outfit was the_ girl. But an Australian in-
ventor has devised a nump that doesn’t block
the footpath or provide an obstacle for im-
petuous motorists to collide with. The new
pump is hung from a cantilever awning.
When not in action its lowest part is Bft.
above the pavement, and it flops another
2ft. when a car needs a drink. There are
gadgets on it that ar e intended to. make it
very troublesome to give short measure, and
the thing can’t leak much because the petrol
is sucked up by a syphon at the moment of
delivery. Another good point is that the
girl can’t dodge round it.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
SILK OR
CHAMOISETIE
GLOVERS
While Melbourne is having the Cup, Syd-
ney is having the Dregs, and socially every-
thing is as dust and ashes. Brides and
would-be brides, politicians, business men,
men who live by the law and men who live
in spite of it are all enjoying the climate of
the Southern Capital.
They want £50,000 for the Limbless Sol-
diers’ Aquatic and Provident Fund, and
£22,000 of it is in hand. That’s an achieve-
ment of solid endeavor, for it is only a few
months since the quest was started. But
then a committee with eight V.C.’s on it
couldn’t help being enthusiastic and vigorous.
The expenses of this appeal have been kept
down to the shadow line; and soon Billjim’s
friends will have the warm knowledge that
the Provident Fund will stand as a screen
between the limbless man’s family and the
cold wind of adversity.
The Rachel Forster Hospital is growing
up. It held its fifth birthday party on Satur-
day afternoon, and to the vigorous little
health centre, amid the dust and pervasive
smells of Gcorge-street, Redfern, friends
came with a gift in the hand or a cheque in
the purse. For the Rachel F'orster unfolded
a new wing to mark the passing of another
year of good work among the women and
children of Sydney; and the gifts went to
the furnishing thereof. The new wing is
filled with light and air, it shines with white
enamel and red tiles, and it can be hosed
out in a few minutes. It is constructed for
speed in handling a rush of patients—as
many as 100 can be attended to in one
afternoon. It's an achievement to be proud
of, and Dr. Harriet Biffin wore this record
of a hospital run by women for women like
a halo. Dame Mary Hughes said the open-
ing words; new Minister for Health Richard
Arthur, in impeccably-creased trousers,
ordered a milk diet for the young; secretary
Katharine Ogilvie w T as efficient in lilac ; Ruby
Rich stood for racial hygiene; Harvey Sut-
ton and Sydney Morris had their say. But
the man who drew every child of the neigh-
borhood wide-eyed to the gates of Rachel
Forster’s back yard was the man who made
the band-music —the wizard Sousa of the
•Police Band.
One of the most crowded cabarets last
week was the yearly party organised by the
Voluntary Workers of the Blinded Soldiers’
Cafe in Pitt-street. Over this, as over
every other of their efforts, loomed the
figure in th e leaf-brown uniform, and the
money from an active traffic in posies and
such-like cabaret by-products will go to
make the ex-Diggers’ lot a little happier.
The Ambassadors was the scene of action,
and one of the dancers —a firm friend of
the disabled Digger—was Mrs. F. A.
Chaffey, whose husband had just made his
first appearance as a member of Mr. Bavin’s
new Ministry. Henry Braddon’s lady was
president of the committee, but as she
could not be present a beribboned basket of
roses and sweet-peas was thrust into the
hands of her deputy, Mrs. Arthur Winn.
Mrs. Arthur Rutter, a never-tiring worker
in the cause of the soldier and his child, was
one of the energetic committee, and Irene
Donaldson, a cafe worker, who is about to be
married, was made tli e subject of a party
within a party and went home the richer by
a cut-glass bowl.
The visiting Lady Cowan is still calling to
the women of the many movements with
which Sydney is dowered to buy nothing but
goods made within the Empire. The lady
is a good speaker with an emotional and
dramatic note in her voice. But unfortu-
nately for her cause there is too much pro-
logue and epilogue to her matter. At the
Feminist Club the other afternoon she
aroused some of her listeners from the state
of inertia into which they had sunk during
her preliminaries to a fire of interested atteu
tion which she later on quenched in her
tardy rounding off. Still her summing-up,
“Every time you buy American stockings
or German gloves you are keeeping Aus-
tralians and Englishmen out of employment,”
may awaken some transgressor to a sense
of her guilt. The lady, who is president of
the British Women’s Patriotic League, is
out to establish an Empire Shopping Week,
and the slogan of not only that week but
every week should be. what this epistle is
always preaching: “Australian-made if you
can and British-made if you can’t.”
Th? bells of St. Mary's rang ont over the
declaration of Lalla Rotter, of Double Bay,
and Roy Morris, of Bondi, to bo ever as one
till Death do them part. Balia’s dress was
a glittering affair of heavy white georgette
thickly frosted with pearls, and from straps
stiff with crystal and pearls rippled a long
wash of tulle train rimmed with silver. A
cloud of tulle veiling and a sheaf of pink
roses were addenda of note, while two brides-
maids in roseate taffetas and a small flower-
girl in fluffy white tulle stepped after the
bride down the rose-decked aisle. Bride’s
mother did the right thing by the guests at
the Australia.
Margaret Potts and James Kelsey were
married at St. Clement’s, in Mosman, last
week. He is an Englishman, and she the
Queensland girl who was racing the train
with the Prince of Wales on board when
H.R.I-I. commanded the train to be stopped
that he might congratulate her on her
riding. . Mr. and Mrs. Kelsey’s future home
will be in Adelaide. The after-reception was
a family affair given at the home of the
bride’s uncle and aunt, Colonel and Mrs.
Dick Welks. Muriel Moses, who has just
become engaged to the cattle Kidmans’ son,
is a cousin of the bride, and was at the
reception, sporting her engagement-ring, a
square-cut diamond surrounded with bril-
liants, also an outsize bar-brooch set with
alternate diamonds and emeralds. The
bride and her two maids were frocked alike
as to period (early-Victorian), the former
in palest daffodil, the two latter, Mavis Wells
and Sylvia Forrest —cousins of the bride
these —in palest green, the lot topped off with
poke bonnets.
Bronzie Clonan, who has probably won
more trophies for exhibition dances than any
other girl in Sydney, dropped her farewell
curtsey to spinsterhood last Thursday after-
noon. Bronzie, who is an attractive slip
of a girl, looked like the inspiration of the
Sugar-Plum Fairy as she stepped in a ruffle
of knee-length pink tulle frills to the altar
of St. Mary’s. The veil was a rosy blush
that rippled and dimpled into a train of
great length. This thistledown raiment had
garlands spun upon it, while a long trail
of pink roses swayed the length of its right
side. Sister Lynette and Maud Reynolds
followed the bride in a surge of pink chiffons
and moire sprinkled with pink buds and
armed to the teeth with pink roses. The
lucky young man was Eric Howard Reynolds,
only son of the F. H. Reynoldses of Strath-
field. Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Clonan did the
handsome thing by the guests at the Aus-
tralia, Mrs. Clonan standing up to the spot-
light in black lace over pale bronze georgette,
against the shoulder of which yellow pansies
trailed pensively.
Glittering like a Snow Queen, her white
satins sparkling with crystal and pearls and
trailing a furlong or so of silver train in
their wake, Jean Watson, of Double Bay,
murmured her “I wills” to Kendal Ipken-
danz, of Burwood, last week. Padre Micklem
fastened the bonds, and a feature of the
bridal procession was the quaint dressing of
the two small ’maids. Their ankle-length
frocks were of white tulle frilled to the
waist and were topped by flat caps of pearl
such as those beloved by Mary Stewart of
Scotland. There were roses everywhere,
from the altar of St. James’s to the dinner-
tables at the Ambassadors. Over the latter
the bride’s mother presided, caped and
frocked in soft black lace.
Herewith Gwen Robson, a Sydney young-
ster who has turned more music into Braille
than any other enthusiast in Sydney. It
lias been a
work of love
for her brilli-
ant sightless
teacher, Gor-
don Lavers.
For five years
she has been
doing this, and
for five years
he has been
training her
unusual talent
for the piano,
till the girl w T on
from Backhaus
a burst of
praise “bril-
liant and ex-
ceptional,” li e
called her
Gwen goes to
London next
year for fur-
ther study,
and her farewell recital will be given at
the King’s Hall on November 8.
Susan Campbell, eldest daughter of the late
E. C. C. Campbell, of Duntroon, Quean-
beyan, was married at All Saints’, Sutton
Forest, to H. T. Beresford, of Clover Hill
thereabouts. Afterwards the bride’s mother
poured a dish of tea for the guests at Dag-
worth, her Moss Yale home.
Geoffrey Rex, who has played his part in
many an amateur dramatic production, .has
persuaded Trix Browne, of Lindfield, to sign
him on as principal man in her drama of
life. The tall young hero belongs to Perth,
and the wedding is to be an early fixture.
The Kanowna, dressed in gay bunting and
wearing loud-speakers in her hair, was at-
home down Erskine-street wharf way the
other night in the interests of the Red Cross.
Bridge in the smoking and music rooms
and a jazz-band on deck kept the hands and
feet of hundreds busy from eight till twelve;
and a few girls who played a lone hand afar
from the madding amplifier seemed to be in
the best of company and spirits. The Mayor-
ess brought her civic lord, and looked grati-
fied with a presentation posy of rich red
roses that brightened the Carmen-like red
and gold of her frocking. The Macdonald-
Hamilton line had loaned the boat, and Mr.
Duncan and Captain Newberry represented
the company, while 11. L. Pitt, on behalf of
the Red Cross, played the part of receiver.
Mrs. C. Loriard was the president of the
committee and upheld her position in lus-
cious blues and silver. Mrs. Roy Evans, who
had organised the success, contemplated the
result from a shimmer of black sequins, and
Mrs. Harold Vale, who was one of the night’s
hostesses, wore rosy taffetas.
A special item of interest at the Arts and
Crafts Exhibition was the latex work shown
for the first time; the lady pictured on this
page, Myra
Blair, of Gor-
don, wli o is
Mr s. F. J.
Sommerhoff in
private life,
won much
notice for her
display of the
new art. It is
a form of
modelling on
wood with
material made
from the sap
of the rubber-
tree. Colored
and modelled
on to the
article, the
latex lends
itself t o bold
treatment, and
dries hard and
bright; and it
will not chip. The exhibit showed work on
ornamental boxes and candle-shades of black
lacquered wood.
Small children from Lisgar, the home
which is a special charge of the Deaconesses’
Institution, sang their prettiest as a welcome
to Miss Pallister, the principal, who has
been away from Sydney for over a year.
Her return coincided with the annual sale
of work, held at the Chapter House of St.
Andrew’s, in aid of this C. of E. philan-
thropy, and the afternoon resolved itself into
an informal levee in her honor. The beau-
tiful stitchery at this sale is famous, and the
crowd of buyers was as great and as eager
as usual. The principal of the Women’s Col-
lege, Miss Susie Williams, declared the
function open, Bishop D’Arcy-Irvine pre-
sided, and Archdeacon Charlton was among
those who voiced their thoughts to interested
listeners.
The Marquis of Cambridge having died
last week and the State Ex. being therefore
m mourning, Henry Braddon, who, being
merely a knight, cannot be expected to feel
such things quite so much, opened the fete
that is to help to secure the White City
tennis-courts to posterity. “Save the ground !”
is the battle-cry of the enthusiastic bounder
after the rubber ball; and, indeed, when you
saw the jolly-looking girls and boys playing
in the exhibition matches the other after-
noon, and realised that the courts are with-
in about 10 minutes’ tram-ride of the city
you immediately plunged in the cause and
bought _ another lucky packet. The Davis
Cup trials are to be played on the grounds
on December 9 and 10, and that should mean
a bit. Pat O’Hara was a flannelled sheik
of note at the fete, which, in addition to the
usual stalls, ran a . dance in the club-house
and burst into a fireworks display.
The three Quinn poets had a little well-
deserved limelight turned on their words
and works at the Lyceum Club last week.
Lod and niece Marjorie were there in the
flesh to turn a charmed ear as their lines
rippled through the delicious broeue of Mrs.
Helena Lowes. But Marjorie’s father, P. E.
Quinn, most gentle and affectionate of men,
was there, alas! only in the spirit; his
slim, -white-haired widow glowed happily
over this recognition of her own poet. The
Quinns are the only Australian family who
can boast three song-writers. Their muse
is enfolded in the Celtic atmosphere, and
when Alfred O'Shea at the end of the read-
ing unleashed his heart-melting tenor in
“Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young
Charms,” a loud and hearty “Cod Save
Ireland!” would have evoked a fervid
Amen !”
The sad story of the undoing of Maggie
I aust was once more unfolded in song
by the Phi], at the Town Hall last
week. British tenor Joseph ILslop was the
bad old man who changed his mind in the
very act of draining the cup of death, and
chose to spoyt with Amaryllis in the shade
instead. Only her name was Marguerite,
and her only brother was at the war. The
gentleman who put his cloven foot, so to speak,
on the nightcap that Faust had prepared
for himself was represented by Victor Evans;
the Mepho. music was well rendered in his
resonant voice, but it might have had a little
more devil in it. Mrs. Goossens-Viceroy
sang with thin sweetness and the ease of
experience, but her voice lacked the dewy
freshness that is associated with the mis-
guided young villager who took the wrong
turning under the stimulus of a whole casket
of jewels. The Siebel of Merle Miller stood
out, and Wilfrid Thomas made the inter-
jectory Wagner a real person. But, of
course, the honors fell to Mr. Hislop, and
the murmured desire of the packed Town
Hall was to hear him in opera.
Joan Norton, the heiress daughter of John
o’ Truth, came back last week, after a
trapse over Europe, principally Italy. Part
of her time abroad was given over to the
study of singing—she is the possessor of a
good contralto.
The Otranto brought back Bertie Kelly’s
eldest son, named, like himself, Thomas
Henry. The young man, who has been away
from Australia for eight years, first at
Eton, then at Oxford, is described as a like-
able fellow, whose intention is to help father
carry on the business which a stout old
grand-dad founded.
A Sydney paper, commenting on recent
race-week dressing, mentioned the simplicity
in the frocking of a certain leader of the
smart set, and remarked that flappers of
16 would do well to copy the lady’s hat.
The flapper of 16 who could copy that lady’s
hat would be doing remarkably well.
The hat was one of those felt anyhows that
are freely described as Vagabond, and are
sold by brigands in shops for six or eight
guineas. But the ornament in it was the
genuine thing, and worth somewhere about
a hundred pounds.
Somebody in a Sydney daily asks: “Is it
flat life that has caused the recent rush for
divorce?” Not so much flat as flat-iron
life, perhaps.
“Nobody’s Widow,” with clever and pretty
Val Cohen as the weedgrower, is booked
for the Vagabonds’ next production. The
J.C.W. firm has lent Avery Hopgood’s
laugh-raiser to this unflagging band of good
workers. Ruby Coxhead, the skipper of the
.willing crew, will again be on deck, and so
will popular Trilby Jago.
On Saturday, the 26th. the Rawson will
make three trips from Fort Macquarie to
Covcerag, Middle Harbor. At ten o’clock, a
quarter-past one and half-past three the
ferry will do the run with a human cargo
interested in Tresillian North mothercraft
training home. This harbor outing is a
money-raising scheme for the home, and an
energetic band, led by Dr. Richard Arthur’s
wife, is planning a children’s Christmas
party in the same cause.
Mozart, Tscliaikowsky and Brahms were
the composers chosen for the last of the
Conservatorium’s Chamber Music concerts.
Bessie Coleman played the piano, Lionel
Lawson the violin and Gladstone Bell the
’cello in the Brahms trio in C minor, and
their work was brilliant and suave and
altogether admirable. The Tschaikow T sky
quartette in D major was served equally
well by the bows of Alfred Hill, Lionel
Lawson, Gladstone Bell and Gerald Walenn.
On December 6, at the Australian Hall in
Elizabeth-street, Sydney, musicians and
artists and writers will give poet Rod Quinn
a Christmas party. The cheerio has been
named “A Night in Bohemia,” and Rod’s
poems recited by Lawrence Campbell, songs
by Charlie Smythe, lightning sketches by
D. H. Souter, George Taylor and Fred But-
ler, and music by the Orpheum orchestra are
a few of the ideas to be embodied in the
programme. The tickets will be blue and
white, and you can have the white for
i>s. 6d. and the blue for 4s. 6d., or Bs. will
buy a Seidlitz powder.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Great preparations
were made for the marriage of Cecilia
Strickland, daughter of a one-time Governor
of N.S.W., to Captain Hubert de Trafford,
of another ancient and Catholic family. In
Australia the Strickland girls earned golden
opinions for their devotion to their invalid
mother. The latter was the sister of the
late Earl do la Warr, and a famous beauty
in her youth. Another sister is now Lady
Mary Griffin, whose wonderful wavy hair of
Titian gold begins to show many threads of
silver. A third sister, Lady Mary Sackville,
has written some really fine poetry. Sir
Gerald will retire from the House of Com-
mons at the next elections, but he still has
a political job in Malta to occupy him.
Rene Stoddart, wdio hangs out her sign as
masseuse in Rananaland’s capital, returned
in the Cathay after a hurried visit to
England, and is spending a couple of
we:ks in Sydney on her way north. The
lady has a fine record of w r ar service to her
credit.

Beautiful weather gave a lustre to Derby
day which the yawning V.R. pens of the
members’ stand at Flemington could not
dim—the death of the Marquis of Cambridge
entailed a period of Court mourning. The
course looked festive with its wavy hedge of
roses, mainly white, against the rails and
standard blooms of all shades scattered
amid the lawns. More crimson roses
cascaded over the stairs of the stand, the
front of which was outlined with boxes of
yellow and purple pansies. The day being
brilliantly fine and warm, chiffons, georg-
ettes and laces were worn. by women,
usually with a full-length coat. There was
a medley of modes and shades, gowns being
cut very much on the same lines as those of
last year. Most women displayed as much
leg as they did last year—an inch or so more
in many cases. Magpie effects in frocking,
recently so popular, figured rather incon-
spicuously amid a conglomeration of navy,
beige, red, blue, green, figured or spotted
dresses. Lace was greatly featured, chiefly
in fawn and pink tones, and even bottle-
green got an airing. Capes were in favor.
Plain straw hats in honey and pale gold
tones had many wearers, but there were
lots of reds and other brilliant shades to add
radiance to the scene. Many gay parasols
were raised aloft —some of lace and of
crocheted straw, others of white picked out
in black, and one just like an iced cake,
White with a wriggly pattern in pink.
The usual ceremony of decorating the
Derby winner with the blue ribbon was
dispensed with in the absence of vice-
royalty. The win of Trivalve was so
popular, and the horse posed so intelligently
for his photograph, that it seeiiied a pity
to rob him of his ribbon. Mayoress Morell
was on the lawn in a gown of sandalwood-
brown georgette and lace with same toned
straw millinery. Daughter Sheila was one
of the very few girls who wore white, a
charming creation of georgette and Richelieu
lace. Mrs. Alan Currie, of Ercildounc,
looked well in a bois-de-rose gown finished
with a cape and topped by a fawn crinoline
straw and velvet hat. Mrs. J. O. Fairbairn
combined sapphire blue and fawn in her
ensemble turn-out. Wedgwood blue was
featured in the hat and raiment of Mrs.
Neville Fraser. Mrs. Leslie Macdonald,
just back from Europe, had a deep border
of natural fox fur upon her black georgette
coat, which covered a black gown. The
Weedon lady appeared all in mushroom pink
with additions of brown fur, and a crinoline
hat with tulle. Mrs. Felix Booth and Mrs.
J. J. Rouse were two well-turned;put
Sydney visitors, the latter’s black frock
having relief of lacquer red. Cherries rested
on her hat brim. Mrs. Felix Lloyd's
jumper suit, worn with a harmonising hat,
was of reseda green with a touch of Oriental
embroidery. Miss Colin Campbell Smith, a
visitor from Nelson (M.L.), who accompanied
Mrs. Percy Blackbourn, was a study in red
frock and hat, with a touch of white. The
elder lady wore a smart black ensemble.
Mrs. Charlie Lyon’s attractive magpie
raiment Was of black satin, with white
organdie muslin, worn with a white hat.
Mrs. Napier also was in black and white
attire. Mrs. Clive Leonard was in black
chiffon patterned with pink roses, allied to a
wine-colored hat. An almond-green frock
with a dull gold hat were worn by Mrs.
Spiller Brandon, of Sydney. There were
many luncheon and afternoon tea-parties
under the elms, one of the hostesses being
Mrs. A. T. Payne. Mrs. A. V. Kewney
spread damask in the members’ dining-room’
for some friends, including a few members
of the social press.
The audience at the Boucicault-Van-
brugh performance of “Caroline” at the
King’s on Saturday night was the best-
dressed seen in any theatre for many months.
Dame Melba looked out from a box in a
sparkling black gown and a white wrap.
With her were the Davidson couple—evi-
dently V.-R. mourning for the Queen’s
brother doesn't extend to secretaries. The
diva’s son George and his wife were in the
forefront of the d.c. with Mrs. Little, who
was one of the Philip Morton girls, of Syd-
ney. The Boucicault edict against floral
tributes was defied by Melba, who heaved on
to the stage a bouquet of roses, and followed
it with a posy of lilies of the valley at the
curtain, but her example was not followed.
Among first-nighters were’Mayor Morell and
his lady and Sheila; the Tallis lady: the
Robinson lady, whose cerise frock cheered the.
stalls: Mrs. Cautley Sliaw, a visitor from
Rhodesia: Mrs. 11. M. Cutlibertson, Mrs.
Richard Fitcher, the Lort Smith couple and
the C. J. Aherns. Joan Chirnside, Bettine
Brown and Betty Shackell were representa-
tives of the younger set whose frocks at-
tracted attention by their smartness.
Irene Vanbrugh looks younger than ever,
and wears dashing clothes as becomingly as
of old. She makes her entrance in a pale-gold
satin frock of flounced mode, with a cape of
darker velvet bordered with blending fur.
A small black hat, laced at one side and
lined with orange, helps the effect. In Act
II her attire is mainly accordeon-pleated
georgette of flesh toning that shows beneath
it knickers of deep-pink satin. A green
sequin serpent as garter coiled round her
shapely leg is not concealed. A long sleeve-
less coat goes over all. A pink-satin and
blue taffeta gown is worn with a bridge
coat of pink, and another item of finery
is a wonderful orange, red and green ombre
georgette cape with gold lace. Prudence
Vanburgh, who is a well-set-up young
woman, looks her best in a sports suit —a
white jumper, with bordcrings of dull silver,
a grey skirt, and a white felt hat with a
silver cockade. Peggy Carter’s long legs and
arms emerged from attire of blue ninon pat-
terned with pink roses, a silver-grey straw
hat trimmed with powder-blue velvet com-
pleting the picture. Annie Saker, as the
maid, strikes a new note in a uniform of
deep wine color, to blend with a drawing-
room upholstered in pale gold.
It was “roses, roses all the way” at the
party given in honor of Mrs. Amery at the
Town Hall by Mayoress Morell. Big
baskets of crimson roses adorned the tea-
tables, and a huge bouquet of the same
blooms presented to the guest of honor
found effective setting against her black
chiffon velvet frock. The Mayoress wore an
ensemble of cafe au lait hue, a coat of
georgette covering a flounced lace frock. A
mastic straw hat with dull gold ribbon com-
pleted the picture. Sheila Morell was
simply clad in green and white spotted
foulard, with a reseda straw fiat. The new
banquet hall made an ideal reception-room,
since there is a foyer, where was stationed
for this occasion a string orchestra. The
Glasgow lady’s ensemble in cape mode had
herring-bone trimming over magpie patterned
foulard. A sporting note was introduced by
General Cliauvel’s lady, whose white silk
jumper suit and straw hat suggested tennis
attire. The Weedon ex-Mayoress, who made
reappearance after two years’ travelling, was
a symphony in clouds of pearl-grey chiffon,
with crinoline millinery. The Irvine and
Lockyer ladies/ favored gowns of navy. Miss
Fieling, who is accompanying Mrs. Amery
on her trip, was present, clad in dark blue.
Mrs. 11. I. Cohen’s rust-red bordered voile
gown and the two-piece raiment of sapphire
blue featured by Mrs. 11. 11. Smith bright-
ened up a dress parade that was otherwise
very sombre. Mrs. Stanley Hammond, Mrs.
A. V. Kewney and Mrs. Joseph Levi wore
black.
This demure lass is Lilian Bennett, upon
whom the London College of Music recently
conferred a teacher’s diploma for elocution.
She is one of
the pupils of
Dulcie Bland,
the Repertory
star, who has
just entered on
a professional
career. Miss
B e n n e 11 is
arranging a re-
cital in con-
junction with
Marie Brunt,
a fellow-
student. As a
member of the
Green and Tan
Dramatic Club
she has suc-
cessfully faced
a n audience.
Her one attack
of stage-friglit
happened at
a competition,
where she ran off, but she won prizes in
many such contests after that.
The Dominion Secretary’s wife took aftcr-
nooon-tea with members of the Lyceum Club
on Friday afternoon. The acting-president.
Mrs. E. F. Allan, with the lion, sec., Lucy
Rowe, greeted the guest, who received a posy
of pink roses and lilies of the valley that
came from the Oswald Syme garden at Mace-
don. The gathering was just for a chat and
a cup of tea. Dr. Georgina Sweet, Dr.
Gwynnetli Buchanan, Dr. Constance Ellis,
the Masson lady, Esther Paterson, with a
large hat shading an ecru-lace frock, Mrs.
T. W. White, in ensemble covering of mush-
room-pink georgette and radium lace, and
Mrs. Mortill were among those who clinked
teaspoons.
Mrs. Richard Linton, whose husband is
chief of the Big Brothers and who lately
added a seat in Parliament to his responsi-
bilities, provided bridge and tea at her South
Yarra home on Thursday afternoon to rake
in funds for the Women's Hospital. The
hostess, who is president of the South Yarra
Auxiliary, wore beige georgette and lace. The
lion sec., Mrs. O. 11. Flecker, and lion, treas.
Mrs. 11. N. Corney gave assistance. Mrs.
Herbert Broookes, president of the hospital,
pressed into service Lorna Reid and some
young musicians from the Uni. Con. to enter-
tain the party. Amongst the guests were
Mrs. L. S. Amery, in black, with a smart
black cape embellished with fine 'tucking,
Mayoress Morell and her daughter Sheila,
Mrs. George Langridge, Mrs. F. Thiel and
Laura Nyulasy.
Caught in contemplative mood by a

A dance field at -the Wattle Path Palai s,
St. Kilda, one night last week was intended
to help lay the rails for Alfred Hospital’s
big annual ball. Mrs. Russell Gabb, whose
white robe was traced in a small floral design
in coral and glistening beads, was convener,
the Best lady, in black with a splash of
crystal, being president of the organising
committee. Secretarial chores were shared
by Misses E. Nicholls, F. M. Hughes and
A. L. S. Russell. Wearing a lavender-
colored gown with some glistening adorn-
ment, Mrs. E. M. Pearce, with Mrs. Harold
Gunnerson, did good trade with a novelty
stall. Pretty girls who tried their hands
successfully as sales ladies were Edna
Tabart, Marie and Jean Gabb and Sylvia
Knox-Knight. Among the feminine patrons
were Mrs. Robert Knox, sheathed in dull
gold and mauve btocade; Mrs. Russell
Clarke, whose georgette frock was of lapis-
lazuli hue; Mrs. Norman Bayles, in a black
sequined robe; Mrs. Barry Thomson,
whose white gown was traced all over in
gold and colored silk embroidery; and Mrs.
Maurice Patkin, in apple green with gold
sequins. The younger set was represented
bv Joan Lempriere, a sparkle of pale blue
and crystal; Margot Best, with diamente
upon her pervenche-blue apparel; and Pat
Lempriere, in floatings of pale lilac
georgette.
The Australian Women’s National Club
put on a specially big kettle on Friday to
celebrate the return of the Weedon lady,
a prominent worker always in the club's
interests. Mrs. Watson Robertson, the presi-
dent, led the rejoicing and passed some
pansies to the honored guest, who as usual
was attired in her favorite shade of grey.
Mayor Morell was roped in to give the
National Rose Society’s show its kick-off, and
lie didn’t have a hard job, since everybody
knows something about roses. This is a
record season for Victoria, as the thrip lias
given us a miss and the worm cankeretli not
the heart of the bud. Alister Clark sent
along a great non-competitive display. The
winner in ope section arranged her blooms
in long baskets with high handles, and they
looked very pretty. Blamire Young had
some good entries. Very few yellow roses
were to be seen. Some enthusiastic rosarians
present at tbe opening were Mrs. Philip Rus-
sell, Mrs. Rupert Downes, Mrs. A. V. Kew-
ney and Ella Guthrie.
“Faust,” which gave Carmencita Mascagni
the task of singing the solos allotted to Mar-
guerita, was given by the Italo-Australiau
Grand Opera Co. at the Princess on Satur-
day night, when a large and not too critical
audience gave the players a lot of encourage-
ment. Dorothy Malison, who was the Siebel
of the cast, has a promising voice, but the
Faust of Vincent MeMurray was not vocally
impressive. Mrs. M. Quinnell, Dr. Bartolini,
Mrs. E. Dyson and her sister Mrs. Jackson
were among the auditors.
A show 7 of English and Australian land-
scapes at Margaret Mac Lean’s studio _in
Cornliill Buildings helps to solve the Christ-
mas gifts problem. The thumbnails of
color, priced from half a guinea to five
guineas, make very suitable presents from
those who can afford that sort of thing to
those who can appreciate it. Norah Gurdon,
John Farmer, Jessie Traill, Margaret Mac-
Lean and Polly Henry are represented in
oils; and Elsie Barlow, Rose Walker and
some others contribute dainty water-colors.
Elma Roche, who shares the studio, exhibits
beautifully-painted woodwork.
The death of the Marquis of Cambridge
came, so far as Melbourne was concerned,
at a most inopportune time, and the procla-
mation of Court mourning during our great
annual racing carnival has meant the loss
of much money to the purveyors of feminine
attire, who expect a harvest at this time.
Two vice-regal dances and a garden-party
have been cancelled, and the State Govern-
ment House garden-party has been postponed
to the 10th, which will be too late to help
trade much, as most of the visitors will be
out of town. The date originally fixed for
the afternoon carnival at the Green Mill for
St. Vincent’s Hospital clashed with a V.R.
party, so there was a hurried setting forward
of the date to the Bth, and it is now too late
to put it back. Another event postponed for
a similar reason was the Naval and Military
Club ball, which was to occupy St. Kilda
Town Hall last Friday night, but is now set
forward for the 18th.
A veritable triumph for Father Francis
O’Keefe, the organiser, was the ceremony of
laying the foundation stone of the memorial
chapel at Xavier College on Sunday after-
noon. By train, tram and private car
streams of people came until 1500 old boys
and near friends of the college and their
womenfolk had assembled. Spreading them-
selves on the heights on which the school
is built in Barker’s-road, Ivew. they first
witnessed the blessing of the very solid
foundations, and then gathered in the beauti-
ful quadrangle, the pride of the ample
grounds, to listen to Dr. A. L. Kenny.
Father Frost (rector) and Arclibish.
Mannix. Shaped like a Latin cross,
the chapel will be in the Italian re-
naissance style, with a dome rising 102 ft.
from the floor level. It will hold 000, and
will cost £20,000. To supplement £lO,OOO
already in hand or promised, £lOOO was
subscribed during the afternoon. With the
help of wireless and loud-speakers everybody
in the grounds heard the speeches, which
were also broadcast.
Gertrude Alice Jones, of Bendigo, is the
envy of the other skirted lawyers of Vic.,
as the Prothonotary (William Richards) has
described her in the Government Gazette
as “a gentleman.” Not only that, but Rich-
ards has made Irvine, C.J., a party to
the classification. He published a list of
12 “undermentioned gentlemen” appointed
commissioners for taking affidavits by
’Sonali, and she was seventh on the list. If
she had issued a poster throughout the
State or been starred in the Woman’s
Mirror she could not have obtained greater
prominence.
Melbourne has managed to lure Dr. Hilda
Kincaid back from Sydney. She is to super-
vise child-welfare work for the City Council,
and will co-operate generally with Dr. Dale,
the medical health-officer. A few years ago
Dr. Kincaid lived at Kinkora-road, Haw-
thorn' with her people. They held for a
while the old home of the Patrick O’Briens,
but sold it after she trekked to Sydney.
The Horse Carnival has lured Mrs. Keith
Brougham from her Yalcowinna shcepwaik
near Broken Hill. Mrs. Herbert Parker is
giving the visitor house room at Studley
Flats, Toorak.
Some notes from Canberra: —
Minister Charlie Marr, with wife and daughter
Beryl, son Victor and several vanloads of impedi-
menta, have arrived and taken possession of their
cottage at Blandfordia, where gangs of men have
been busy garden-making. Eldest daughter Muriel,
whose engagement to Dr. Clyde Findlay, Canberra’s
first private practitioner, was recently announced, has
resigned from the Children’s Hospital and will join
the family next week.
Littleton Groom’s lady bravely held a “garden-
party” last week in the bare paved courtyards of
Parliament House, beneath the leafless poplars
planted there just 12 months ago, and the party
was enjoyed in .spite of the shortcomings of the
background.
On Tuesday night a merry party of about 50
members of the younger set invaded the Hotel Can-
berra drawing-room, and was entertained by 12 of
Canberra’s bachelors, aided by a jazz orchestra.
Last week Duntroon Military College achieved one
of its rare spasms of gaiety, when crowds of visitors
invaded the village to attend the annual sports
gathering, which was followed by a dance at night.
The attendance at a gymkhana and dance on Satur-
day was rather less, as many were attracted to the
meeting of the Canberra Racing Club at Acton.
Although the weather was rather chill, the frocking
was very gay.
The annual ball of the Canberra Tennis Associa-
tion on Friday night was a success. Cups and
trophies won during the year were presented.
A team of lady golfers from Goulburn was enter-
tained by the Ladies’ Golf Club on Friday. Tin;
Goulburn ladies were losers, but play on both sides
was good.

MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND OF THE FIRST
‘FIVE-THREE’ BEALE PLAYER-PIANO WERE
SOLD. THE IMPROVED‘FIVE-THREE’MODEL IS
PROVING EVEN MORE POPULAR.
A GREATLY IMPROVED PLAYER-PIANO
BUT STILL THE SAME PRICE
NNOUNCED four years ago, the 'Five-
Three’ Beale has ever since been the best
Quality Player on the market. Now comes
the improved model —-at the same price!
We sold over ten thousand of the first
model. No other player has become so popu-
lar as the 'Five-Three’ Beale in
so short a time. The improved
model is an even bigger hit.
Take casework alone. This is of
walnut—laid vertically instead
of horizontally. That shows the
grain of the wood to better ad-
vantage. The top and bottom
doors are the new flush type —
beautifully inlaid with black-
wood. No resting place for dust.
All corners are rounded for the
same reason. The finish is hand-
rubbed crystal-clear lacquer—

instruments with
the Improved ‘Five-
Three’ Beale, ONLY
COMPARE INSTRU-
MENTS IN THE HIGH-
EST-PRICED CLASS.
The ‘Five-Three’ was
designed to compete
with this class, and
this only, nctwlth-
standing the low
price for which it is
sold.
not the old-time French polish or varnish. It
won’t crack, go white, check, sink into the wood,
or grow dull. All felt, including hammers, is
moth proof. Yet the price is no more than we
asked for the old model. See the completely
dismantled instrument now being displayed in
our showrooms. Every part is
exposed and can be examined in
detail. And the hot-water test!
Don’t miss that. It’s the most
amazing evidence of confidence.
The Beale player action contains
every proved device for perfect
expression and interpretation.
As for terms, they are the easi-
est possible. If you cannot call,
ask for catalogues and printed
matter. Posted free anywhere.
An enquiry will not entail the
slightest obligation upon you.

Rain fell on Tattersall’s races, and amidst
the multi-hued blossomry moved tlie sad-
colored waterproof and useful umbrella. Mrs.
Jimmy Blair was amongst those who gave
tea parties. She wore wine-colored cr&pe de
Chine and gold girdle, Mrs. Cadell Garrick
was in figured crepe de Chine. Mrs. Cecil
Palmer was in navy, and Eve Jeffrey wore
a brown fur coat over her mastic frock.
Mrs. Stuart Tait was in almond-green.
Governor Goodwin, after travelling several
thousand miles in Queensland, expresses
himself as full of admiration for the sturdy
spirit in which the Outbacker faces drought
and other troubles. Their Exes, have can-
celled an intended trip to Melbourne on
account of the death in the Windsor family.
The Toowong Rowing Club had a dance to
help the funds for the flower stall in the
coming fete. St. Lucia Hall was decorated
with pennants and rainbow-streamers, and
there were special prizes for fancy dress.
The fete at the Hospice was held in rainy
weather, but the flags fluttered gaily over
beds of larkspur, foxglove and rose, and the
memorial drinking fountain for birds with
its inscription, “Their songs shall rise to
Thee,” reflected the sympathetic faces of
many visitors, while the Belgium Society
benefited to the tune of £73.
Queensland can be proud of this young
man. He is Claude Monteith, F.R.C.0.,
A.R.C.M., and has just returned from four
and a half
years’ study of

company of the A.I.F. in France.
A bride of the week was Doreen Morgan,
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. T. 11. Morgan,
of Wickliam-terrace, who married Theo John
Bale, of Windsor, in a setting of lilies and
roses at St. Andrew’s kirk. The bride wore
ivory georgette over pale pink, with tulle
veil and orange blossoms, and she carried
a bouquet of pale pink carnations and
orchids. Doris Henderson and Ada Bale

The finest of weather failed to draw a
very large attendance at the opening day
of the T.R.C. meeting at Elwick. Possibly
the Show and its attendant festivities had
been as much as the big country contingent
felt justified in leaving their baa-lambs for,
and most of them had gone northwards
again. It is too early in the season for the
flock of mainland visitors that is always a
feature of the summer meeting. The
O’Gradys, pere et fille, were received by the
President and Mrs. Tom Lyons, who enter-
tained a number of friends at tea, Margaret
O’Grady looking smart, if somewhat wintry,
considering the warm day, in a black squash
coat, banded wth brown fur, worn over a
navy frock. Mrs. Lyons was in a georgette
coat of soft blue (worn over a blue erdpe-
de-Chine frock) embroidered with cut work
outlined in white, and two pretty daughters
helped. There were a few wide-brimmed
hats to be seen, but most women kept to
the small and much more becoming shapes
of to-day and yesteryear.
Vivacious little Alison Cameron, daughter
of the Eustace Camerons of Mona Vale,
Ross, has decided to take the matrimonial
plunge with Hugh Austin, late of Murgha,
Deniliquin, N.S.W. The prospective bride-
groom was over in Tasmania, and the en-
gaged pair were to be seen together at the
races before going up to Mona Vale.
The harbor was a study in blue and
white on the Saturday of the first yachting
races of the season. There was a big muster
of yachts, large and small, and several
waterfront dwellers entertained small parties
in their gardens or on verandahs and bal-
conies. Mainland folk who only come to
Tassie at the end of the dry summer have
no idea of the beauties we can show in
these earlier days.
Mrs. Mary Taylor, whose portrait ap-
peared in this page lately, had the day of her
life when no fewer than 12 philanthropic
societies sent representatives to honor her, in
the Mayor’s reception-room at the Town
Hall. Mrs. Baxter organised the function,
and a big audience witnessed the presenta-
tion to Mrs. Taylor of a handsome hand-
bag containing a roll of notes. The day
coincided with Mrs. Taylor’s birthday, and a
large cake with 21 candles (to commemorate
her 21 years’ service with the National
Federation) was cut at the conclusion of the
presentation ceremony. The pretty address
which accompanied the handbag was the
work of Mrs. John Kennedy.
The golden wedding of David Johnstone
and his wife, celebrated here this month, sets
people to thinking of the early days of our
little island. David Johnstone came from
Scotland in 1873 and was one of the pioneers
of the woollen industry in Tasmania, start-
ing at first at the Waverley mills in Laun-
ceston, and removing to Hobart in 1883.
The old folk are in the best of health, and

during those years, are contemplating mak-
ing another.

The W.A. Trotting Club had a birthday
last week and celebrated it in fine weather
on its pretty rose-bordered course. Governor
Campion lent his presence to the festival,
which brought out all the sports and a fine
array of between-season's finery. Outsiders
romped home consistently, and McShortodds
beamed seraphically.
Mrs. Waldie Forbes, of Cottesloe,
hostessed one of the smartest bridge parties
of the year in a gown of vieux-rose crepe de
Chine. The Hobbs lady, Mrs. Ferguson-
Stewart, Mrs. Hunn, Mrs. Drakc-Brockman,
Mrs. Hubert Parker, Mrs. Fred Burt, Mrs.
Goode and Mrs. Tivey were among the
guests.
Mrs. Walter Mcßostie produced “Hus-
bands Are a Problem,” and scored a success.
The scenery was well done and the frockihg
smart. Many posies rewarded the per-
formers. ,
The Swan River Rowing Club closed its
season at what was advertised as a flannel
dance, but the majority of the men preferred
evening dress. There was a big attendance,
and Nette Wilson, secretary for the dance
committee, had reason to look pleased at
the result of her labors.
The “Rose Marie” concert at His Majesty’s
held on Sunday evening, to buy equipment
for Perth Hospital drew a crowded house.
There was a burlesque of the first act of
the play, and several items by the company.
The Totem Ballet girls sold programmes
and sweets in their quaint attire. The con-
cert gave a handsome financial return.
The principal engagement announcement
of the week concerns Olive Mc-Crae, of Ger-
aldton, and Leighton Moustaka, of Perth.
Capt. Athol Hobbs, younger son of Lieut.-
General Talbot Hobbs and his lady, married
Evelyn Croxon, a London girl, at St. Luke’s,
Cottesloe. The Hobbs lady held a reception

The Cup exodus has enforced on us a
period of social calm with only a charity
effort or two or a hint of coming revel to
break its placid surface. Vida Laliey’s ex-
hibition of pictures has been opened by Dr.
Gertrude Halley, who knew her in New
South AVales and is a staunch admirer of her
work. The Gallery has bought a flower-study,
“In the Window.” The Society of Arts has
had its annual meeting and put Mr. Howie
into Mr. White’s vacated presidential chair.
Meanwhile, despite bad times, there is
money to be had when it’s wanted. Three
hundred pounds goes to the Limbless
Soldiers’ Association from the sale of the
Governor’s pictures, and the Mayoress’s
appeal for the Blind brought in nearly £530.
A syndicate has bought part of the property
of the Torrensford Land and Gravel Pits,
with a frontage to the North-East-road and
the Torrens, for yet another golf links: and
over £2OO came from a fete at the Wilder-
ness school. That fete incidentally resolved
itself into a reception in honor of Airs.

The Glee Club and Orchestra began their
joint concert with the “William Tell” over-
ture, thereby
giving Harold
Parsons oppor-

himself at his

of the evening
was a repeti-
tion of Feli-

“The Desert,”
first given here
at a similar

in June. The

Wagner numbers for its final concert this
week.
The Navy League has had its annual
meeting, too, and won Professor A. L.
Campbell’s commendation (lie was the
speaker of the evening) as the most active
branch in the Commonwealth. The English-
Speaking Union has heard Prof. Archibald
Strong’s impressions of India and arranged
a reception to Melba when she comes here
in November.
The Kindergarten Union, now 22 years
old, gave an excellent account of itself at its
annual meeting. At the Training College
there are 26 students, all certain to be
snapped up by private schools as soon ns
they have earned their diplomas, and a new
kindergarten has been opened at Bowden.
Funds are needed, and the early part of next

V.H.K.: Too weak a tail Lilli Pilli:
Good idea for a column.... J.M.H.: Poor use made
of good material Victor It.: No. Why don’t you
tell the story instead of leaving it to be guessed at ?
. ...C.McE.: Close up; the ending is the weakest
part of it.... Ben G.: Saw it coming. But it s a
good character study... .Frances L.: Sorry ; but it
has been said so many times.... Stone: The remedy
would be worse than the disease... .H.W.C.: Have
never known old Australian diggers who talked like
that Prickly J.: Actually responsibility for the
line was taken over much earlier, but for con-
venience sake S. Aus. continued to control opera-
tions on it under agreement... .R.F.T.: Par. value
only H.M. (Perth): Has a chance; but writing
on one side of the paper is the beginning of
journalistic wisdom.... Colin W.: Well, the verse
has to march away, anyhow.... Roy J. L.: \ou have
some sense of humor; but you need to practise
verse-writing....T.W.N.: Painfully manufactured.
F.T. (Concord) : “Bourke” doesn’t rhyme with
“worst,” nor “lands” with “grand.” Afraid we
could not allow more than par. space for your
article T. 8.: Verse about being dead got the
right atmosphere, at any rate... .E.R.L.: The call
to your disembodied spirit to awake is not inspiring.
Nor are the others Del M.: Can’t tell you how
cheered we were by your invitation to be happy
because we’re certain to be dead to-morrow....
Pat R. (W.A.) : Dull verse Nunc Ergo: Don’t
be so mournful... .N.J.M.: P00r... .Impecunious
Ike: The “owed” is a bankrupt idea. . . .G.L.M. :
“Pat Finch told me this yarn.” But you don’t get
it off Pat enough. . . .J.L.K.: Totters on hamstrung
expressions. . . .Frank L.: Young man who gets so
intoxicated over a voice should be locked up ior
his own safety Dan D.: “Strategy” fails
J.M. (Stanmore) : Wish you’d wake up to the fact
that “Then I woke up” stuff is useless.... S.H.:
(Bowman’s): The devil who laughed “Ila, ha!”
must have had a remarkable sense of humor. .. .
Mulga M.: We like the chronological order: —
In early August, ninety-two,
Ford and Bayley first got through,
And found, the great Coolgardie
in the,year of ninety-three.
.. . .G.S.R.: For one great, delightful moment we
thought it was “The fried onions of bliss.” Alas,
it was only “Tried Annie to kiss” !. . . .Bessie D. T. :
The color in your rainbow. verse is an optical delu-
sion.... John H. : For one thing, “house” does not
rhyme with “shouts”... .C.L.S.: “Three pathetic
verses.” Very pathetic... .J.A.8.: Too roughly
done. . . .E.L.C.: Nothing in it....Pog W. G. : We’ll
sample a couple of dates without committing our-
selves to an opinion:—
Could he who first came here in seventeen eighty-
six „ .
(That 'is the date, I think, that most historians fix)
Could only view Fair Sydney in nineteen twenty-
seven,
Would he not be surprised, and think himself in
Heaven ?
.... Brian L. T.: Might do elsewhere. . . .Ursula C.:
Verses ' are misty in their allegory. Story has
points, but they are not striking enough for the
length. .. .A.M.T.: Verse about finding “the only
eally treasures” goes down. The octopus requires
better telling W.C.T.: The line “It leads to no
place ■ that matters” describes it....Ninian S.:
Impossible Ralph B.: Step down from the stilts
and try it again; but get some better last lines
P.R.S : You’re the third this week claiming to be
dead. But the others don’t know they are... .
Lewis H.: Too long Marg C.: Mediocre, yet you
seem,,to have some promise. Any good book on
prosody would help ; more important is a study of
standard poets W.H.L.: “Epithalamium” gets
altogether too intimate V.O. (Beecroft) : After
we chewed the cud over the cow musings the verse
went out. . .-N-E.S.: Just fails. .. .Jacques: The
over-breathed' thought fades out, but was not badly
done. .. . G.L.D.: “Aged” is also decrepit. .. .Gladys
B.: Orthodox, “fears”-“tears” love spasm K.M.
(Columboola) : They, blow back. . . .H.J.8.: Too
rough for publication. .. .R.E.F.: All the impression
you gave us was depression. .. .S.A.P.: Poor stuff.
Glamis: You get a check Minnie J.: Ideas
commonplace. . You can manage the rest of the
contract, but ideas are essential. .. .F.J.P.: has
all the inspiration of a police report.... Aradne:
Your “Castles” crash; other has a chance....

P.: Not a bad effort; it just fails. .. .Ethel K.: Too
heavy.... Selector: Verse went to rest, too

W.D.S.: Lacks verve. . . .R.C.11.: Faint idea. .. .
M.A.P.: Can’t get a laugh out of the
kookaburra... .Napoo: Exactly.... Musett M.: We
haven’t space to acknowledge everything received
here. If there was no reference to your contribution,
it probably got through to a final reading. “Sim-
plicity” goes out on the first. . . .Raymond J.: “Mists
of gold hung with silver tapestries mingled with
doubt '. . . shot through with passing pleasantries,
a road with milestones marked with years” that
kind of stuff is invariably destroyed by a ramping
lion of an editor with the sword of Damocles in
his hand Jno S.: Intrigued by your statement
that “only to woman, my natural mate, would I
my thoughts impart” T.8.L.: Narrative of your
experiences as a. sundowner is t o(T much like the
track between Hay and Booligal. .. . Dyan : Spell
has no magic T.W.E.: Tut, tut! Most writers
would think themselves lucky with a wife like that.
.. .C.F. (Cook Islands) : “Call” is too faint. ...
Memrae: No special value J.W.W.: Too didactic.
.. ,L C. 8.: Not quite C.W.P.: Its interest
peters out. And do give the inquisitive sub-editor
a chance to poke his pencil in.. ..Waif: We’ve been
trying to say this for years:—
The wheels of fate rotate and make no noise ;
Nor makes a wheel the ticking of the clock,
Nor earthquake shock
Comes of the earth’s rotation;
Such perturbation , , ,
Serves but to show how ages roll and rock,
And punctuate eternal equipoise.

THE INKY WAY.
“Raja” : If various contributors have fin-
ished competing for the distinction of having
battled longest before getting into The Bul-
letin, I want to claim a record in the other
direction. The first story, the first verse and
the first par. I submitted were all accepted
and promptly paid for. Since then, of
course, I have had many rejections and some
doubtless well-merited rebuffs, but nothing has
occurred, to shake my conviction that the
utterly unknown contributor has as good a
chance as the most experienced provided he
submits the right stuff at the appropriate
moment.
“C.” : Of the gems I have gathered in a
long experience of the N.S.W. Parliamentary
press gallery these half-dozen remain always
in my memory
An ounce of experience is worth a ton of salt.
You could no more do it than an Ethiopian could
change his spots.
A body of sharks trying to feather their own nests.
The expense is a trifle —a mere peccadillo.
I only hope that in the career of the present
Government they will show an amount of enterprise
until the whole of the State is honeycombed with
ways as it is honeycombed with means.
1 have travelled from the north to the Soutli right
out to the back west and into the bosom of the
Paciiic.
“J.F.T.” Ernest C. the
recently-elected president of the N.S.W.
Country Press Association, is a native of
Tenterfield. He was a Methodist minister
in Fiji before he made his entry into journal-
ism by purchasing the Glen lunes Exam-
iner. The C.P.A. owes its genesis to Tenter-
field ; in ISOS the Tenterfield Star news-
paper circularised the whole of the country
press urging the formation of such a body.
“W.H.E.”: The evolution of the Christmas
Bulletin (B. 27/10/’27) is. of more than
transitory interest to followers of the Inky
Way. It was Australia’s first attempt 10
publish the choicest of the year’s contribu-
tions. The germ was born in the fertile
brain of ,T. F. Archibald, and it began to
materialise When he sent to the composing-
room overseer a short story labelled “Put
this aside for Christmas.” That was 48
years ago. And the process has been in con-
stant operation ever since. Succeeding
editors have discovered a literary gem. On
goes the tag: “Put aside for Christmas.”
As soon as one Christmas number is pub-
lished, editor and printer begin in January
to prepare for the next. That process
ensures a representative collection of _ the
very best short stories,' verse and artistic
contributions from Australia’s foremost
writers and artists received during the year.
Incidentally, the number to be published on
December 10 will be the 48tli which the
present foreman printer has sent to press.
The restraint and moderation of this
extract from the Shuntienpao, a Chinese
newspaper, are surely admirable: —
The destruction of Ohangteh city and the anni-
hilation of Red Spears to the number of 80,000 by
Marshal Feng Yu-hsiang is reported. This mili-
tarist is increasing in unpopularity wherever he goes.
“Peter” Smart, foreman and part-pro-
prietor of the Kalgoorlie Sun in the days
when it made history and helped editor Hugh
Mahon into the first House of Reps., died the
other day at Albany (W.A. ),aged (56. Peter
was a pertinacious Scot who knew all about
the printing side of the business. After leav-
ing the W.A. goldfields he blossomed out as
a newspaper proprietor at Henty (V ic. 1.
Seven or eight years ago he headed west again
and started the Albany Despatch, on which
he battled till the end.
“Lao-dali” : Some of the staff and some of
the features of Melbourne’s defunct Morning
Post will go over to the Sun-News
Pictorial, but the cocky isn’t likely
to recognise himself very clearly in
the mirror that will be held up to
him by the chosen organ of the Mel-
bourne flapper and the St. Ivilda sheik. Even
its penny-ha’penny opponents admit that the
Morning Post was a good paper of its kind.
In fact, it is hard to see how its staff, with
the limited means at their disposal, could
have made it much better. The attempt to
supply Melbourne with a fourth morning
journal was ill-judged, and a lot of deserving
Inky Wayfarers are out of a job in conse-
quence. One of the ironies of the Morning
Post’s collapse is that its 50,000 circulation,
which is no use to it now, was largely built
up on its campaign against Stadiums, Ltd.
Now that all is over it still has to meet a
writ for £2OOO lodged against it by one of
the wrestlers it attacked.
“Herbertshoe” : The late editor-proprietor
of the Rabaul Times, Harry Hamilton (B.
27/10/’27). had never hesitated to tell the
Administration what he thought of it, which
was presumably why the local Curator of
Intestate Estates descended on the printing
office as soon as news of Hamilton’s death
arrived and claimed possession of the plant
and property. Also he ordered the alteration
of the imprint and the removal of an article
criticising the Administration. The High
Court, when appealed to, after remarking on
the indecent haste of the Curator’s action,
commanded the bailiff to get out and the
Curator to pay costs. What makes the
whole affair look worse is that the dead man
had left a will, deposited in the Central
Court at Rabaul. and that his executor in
Melbourne had wired the management of the
paper to carry on.
“Ivriz” : W.A. had its “authors’ week” like
the rest, but though special attention was sup-
posed to be given to Westralian writers, I
saw no single reference in any newspaper to
the work of John Philip Bourke, who was
born in N.S.W. in IS6O and died at Boulder
in 1914. For many years before his death
Bourke was closely connected with the Kal-
goorlie Sun. Most of his verses appeared in
that paper over the pen-name of “Bluebush,”
while an occasional piece found its way into
The Bulletin. After his death these verses
were collected and edited by A. G. Stephens;
some 2000 copies of “Off the Bluebush” were
printed, and one of them I count among my
most treasured possessions. Probably not
one in ten of the bush reciters who stand on
their pins by the camp-fire to beef out “A
P»loke from Mullingar,” or throw their ges-
tures to their audience by the light of the
hurricane-lamp in a little bush shack, know
that J. P. Bourk' is the ‘"■'tlm- of pieces
which have travelled far and wide into the
cutback of Austr ’lia.

To all lovers of the drama the apparent
indestructibility of Irene Vanbrugh is a sub-
ject for hosannas. The present writer pre-
pared a wreath for the lady’s histrionic grave
at the close of her last season, but he went
home at 10.30 on Saturday night and buried
the emblem. Yet the Vanbrugh appeal is less
that of a great actress than of an enchant-
ing woman. Some women affect to cloak their
personalities in their parts, but the Van-
brugh exploits hers, or, rather, allows it to
flow all over the particular role she is pre-
tending to execute, until even the author
would hardly recognise his creation. The
part she is at present playing in Melbourne,
for instance, was played by Margaret Anglin
as a serious and dramatic one. Before Miss
Vanbrugh rushes on with her nice arms out-
spread and her cleverly thought-out draperies
floating in the wind, the other actors re-
semble so many petrol-pumps. After Irene’s
arrival all things appear to move. Actually
they are all revolving round Irene. Even the
furniture seems to group itself around her.
Whether she is posed wickedly on a sofa or
fussing archly helpless over a telephone, she
is always the centre of the circle ; and when
she inconsequently departs into a bedroom
the centre obediently departs with her. The
piece to which she administered first-aid
on Saturday at the King’s was “Caroline,”
a light comedy by Maugham. It was a farce
balloon so light, not to say gaseous, that
without the weight of the still fair Irene
hanging to the string it would several times
have floated up through the proscenium-arch
and lost itself in the dome ; and all the pro-
ducing excellence of Dion Boucicault —-lie
took a small part beautifully as well—the
solid stagecraft of Norman McKinnel, and the
physical charms of Prudence Vanbrugh and
Peggy Carter would have failed to bring it
down.
$ * * *
Caroline (Miss Vanbrugh) is a middle-aged
grass widow who liasn’trseen her husband for
10 years. Robert Oldham, K.C. (N. McKin-
nel) is an elderly lawyer who has waited all
this time for the husband’s death to claim her
hand. Rex Cunningham (Hugh Williams)
is a young man who nurses a similar passion
for her. Caroline is to date the adored unat-
tainable. When the death of the husband is
announced by cable in the Times, the unat-
tainable becomes immediately available, and
Caroline, from being a star to be worshipped
from the right side of the Divorce Court,
becomes merely a domestic problem. The rest
is persiflage, and sometimes pretty tedious
persiflage at that, but Miss Vanbrugh made
the persiflage worth listening to. Boucicault
was brief but excellent as Caroline’s medical
adviser. Norman McKinnel gave a sound
and careful statement of her elderly admirer,
and Hugh Williams was well enough in place
as her junior ditto. As a picker of attractive
young females, Boucicault has considerable
talent. The sensational height and equally
surprising dresses of Prudence Vanbrugh and
the sinuous motions of Peggy Carter drew
delighted comments. As interfering friends
to Caroline they acted satisfactorily, too.
A witch who has the evil eye,
A maid who has a hot one,
A rover with a loving heart,
A Count who hasn’t got one.
The maid is earmarked for the Count
BuJ: hears the singing rover—
She’s lost her head at once, poor thing.
He loses Ms twice over!
The maid, self-poisoned, sinks upon
Her nut-less Trovatore.
“Wife, brother lost.” the Count laments—
That ends the silly story.

The Verdi-gris hymned above was admir-
ably sung and less admirably acted by the
Italo-Australian grand operators at Melb.
Princess last week. It would be hard to make
the acting admirable because of the foolish-
ness of the story. As Manrico, Antonio Moli-
nari slapped his chest like a conjurer about
to produce something from a hat. What
came out was an extraordinarily loud and
powerful tenor, but melodious withal. The
Count di Luna suffered from a cold in the
possession of the overburdened Filippini, but
Clarice Buchanan was a dignified Leonora
whose emotion found sweetest expression in
the famous Miserere. The traffic was held
up for 10 minutes by General Demand to
allow the duet to be repeated. Elsie Wool-
ley is an excellent actress and a competent
vocalist, and her gipsy carried conviction and
a large share of the total melody. This co.
deserves more consiolration from the public
than it has thus far got; but there is still
time to overwhelm it. On Saturday there
will be a grand double bill, when “C. Rusti-
cana” and “Pagliacci” will be the account
rendered.

Marcella Berardi, as Violetta, was the
chief incitement to go on listening to “La
Traviata” at Melbourne Princess last week.
She was one of the healthiest consumptives
this Showman has ever seeen. Most Vio-
lettas cough too much, but Marcella hardly
coughed at all. Her voice was warm and
fresh and as flexible as a child acrobat, and
her acting was pleasantly unforced. The
story of the girl who led the gay life and
hastened her own decease was told in modern
dress. Dr. Bartolini relieved the overworked
Filippini of Alfredo’s father, and the spec-
tacle of that loquacious person garbed in
frockcoat and spats was compensated for by
the Melbourne singer’s beautifully sufficient
voice. Nor did the flock of diminutive
tenors whom the company affects look their
romantic best in evening clothes, though
Enrico Rigattieri as Violetta’s impatient
swain was convincing enough. As Baron
Dauphol Bert Woolley rolled in stage wealth,
but was more comfortable in his singing than
in his monocle. “Traviata” totters on the
abysm of the absurd. One act is merely a
drawing-room drama, with writing-desk, bell,
butler and French maid set to music, and
the music is not Verdi at his melodious best.
So it says something for the vocal quali-
fications of the present co. that it provided
a reasonably attractive show.

“Pompadour” goes off with her lover for
the last time to-morrow night at Melbourne
His Majesty’s, and on Saturday “The
Student Prince” will be in attendance,
assisted by a host of persons stated to have
been with him since his birth. Miss de
Vries launched the role of Katliie on Europe,
James Liddey did the same for the Prince
and Frederick Blackman staged the musical
piece in England. Vera Spaull, Stigant,
Frank Webster and 40 singing students will
also say “present” when the roll is called.
“Have You Heard the Latest Scandal?
“Sh-’h-’h-’h-’h-’h.
“No Wonder!
“The Whole Town’s Talking.”
It is a barefaced fraud, that advertisement,
if it is intended to imply that the show
mentioned is a naughty one. Those who want
to find out for themselves will meet it at
Melbourne Royal.
“LADY, BE GOOD,” AT SYDNEY
ST. JAMES.
Hoyston McDonnell, eccentric dancer, and
Alec Kellaxoay, the leading man.
Stiffy and Mo having returned to Mel-
bourne, the public showed its reverence for
art by packing the Bijou on Saturday as it
hadn’t been packed for weeks. Actually
Stiffy is far from being an extraordinary
comedian ; such shining as he does is mostly
with the reflected light that emanates from
Mo. Mo’s chief repertorial addition is a coat
which turns out to be a pair of trousers.
The two heroes are attended by a retinue
of revue. It includes the usual tall young
man who, although he can play an ordinary
violin very well, plays one with a foghorn
attachment very badly; the short man with
the comical]y-dwarfish concertina ; the bodily-
attractive half-dozen damsels, who walk
about behind Amy Rochelle with a gait
suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis; and the
two nimble gals who sing untuuefully to
strum-strums. Of the actors in the humor-
ous and numerous sketches, Daisy Merritt
and Sadie Gale are the couple longest remem-
bered.
ITALO-AUSTRALIAN GRAND OPERA
CO. AT MELBOURNE PRINCESS.
Count Ercole Filippini as the Count di
Luna, and Elsie Woolley as Azucena,
in “II Trovatore.”
Wirths’ Circus is an important ingredient
of the Cup in Melbourne. George Carney
and the Colored Emperors of Harmony are
its chief Tivolities. Revolver shots, ghosts
of men and cats, and stage policemen are
still mixing with moderate audiences at the
Athena.'um, where “The Last Warning” is
in vogue; and Gert.’s garter can still be
gotten at the Palace.

Hoyt’s fanciers in Melbourne this week
are sampling “Captain Salvation,” which is
full of ocean and tempestuous weather; and
“Broadway Nights,” which overflows with
girl and whirl. “Millionaires” is keeping
the wolf from the Majestic. The Phillips
Oppenheim story of the Ford family who
rose into the Rolls-Royce class makes good
film fun.
Brushes with the enemy:—
The second edition of the Australian War Museum
will be on view at Melbourne Exhibition until it
goes to Canberra for keeps. The late war was the
first to sit for its portrait. Half the artists of the
embattled nations seem to have donned khaki, got
themselves dubbed hon. lieutenants and rushed with
their palettes to the fray, not so much for the
purpose of painting what they saw as to doll up
Mars as the sentimental public likes to see him.
/Esthetic souls as they were, they turned from the
blood and muck of battlefields to the clouds sailing
placidly above, and from the unpleasantness of
forward dressing-stations to Red Cross barges floating
peacefully in canals. Others painted shell-holes as
interesting problems in light and shade. A few
Futurists depicted- what they saw in stark Zolaesque
terms, but their work has not survived. Of those
who attempted to portray an actual display of
violence, George Lambert is the only one who
moderately succeeds, and even he doesn’t succeed as
well as Lady Butler, who couldn’t paint half as
well and never saw a fight. The things that awaken
memories in the Digger and shaking exclamations
from his feminine accompanist are not the pictures,
but, firstly, the models of Dernancourt, Lone Pine,
the taking of Semakh, in Palestine, and the charge
of the Second Light Horse at Magdhaba, executed
in Melbourne by Leslie Bowles and Wallace Anderson,
with backgrounds by Louis McCubbin ; and, secondly,
the showcases of warlike hardware and all sorts of
curios with curious histories salvaged from the
field. These still-life studies, apparently, are more
realistic than any of the paintings. An interesting
art item is a portrait of the Kaiser by the famous
Laszlo, which the potentate presented to the citizens
of Bismarck, Tas., to cement the bonds between the
Fatherland and the Speck. Then the war broke
out, and Bismarck became Collins Vale, and the
ex-Bismarckians handed Bill’s headpiece to the mili-
tary authorities while a good many of them went
off to fight the owner.
* * * *
Melbourne Art: —
Believers in reincarnation can point triumphantly
to R. W. Sturgess, the young Victorian water-
colorist, as an avatar of Jesse Jewhurst Hilder.
Sturgess’s style was well established before he had
ever seen a picture by the Sydney artist, yet in
many cases the resemblance is striking. The explana-
tion doubtless is similarity of temperament. Sturgess
paints his dreams, but with frequent reference to
Nature. He transposes reality into pictorial music;
lovers of Chopin, Schubert and Mozart —especially
Mozart—will be drawn to Sturgess. He lives at a
place called Williamstown, where all the houses are
enchanted palaces 400 feet in height and the fisher-
men go about in fairy gondolas.
Tourist bureaux, railway departments and the like
which spend thousands yearly in ineffective posters
should run an eye over the examples collected by
Miss Winifred Guy and displayed at the Art Centre,
Victoria-street. Such well-known artists as Norman
Wilkinson, Spencer Pryse, Orpen, Bertram Mac-
kennal, Lamorna Birch and Brangwyn have not dis
dained the lowly medium of the hoarding. Even
futurists like Ethelbert White and McKnight Kauffer
haven’t refrained from painting rectangular summer
girls diving into corkscrew oceans. In fact, the
poster seems to be the only medium the cubist art
is really fitted for. Some of these pictures are
irresistible in the flamboyancy of their appeal. The
British railways use them to such a degree that it
must be hard for a citizen to stay at home for a
holiday in England.
Three new plays will be seen in Sydney
theatres on Saturday. “Outward Bound”
makes way for “The Broken Wing” at the
Palace; at the lioyal, after 105 perform-
ances of “The Ringer,” Moscovitch
changes over to “The Terror”; and
“Lady, Be Good” at the St. James retires
in favor of “Archie.” “Tweekie” continues
to remove the entire population of Crossville
Corners into New York at the Empire; and
' “Castles in the Air” seems likely to be an
enduring edifice at Her Majesty’s. At the
Criterion, “Rain” pours on the stage nightly
to the accompaniment of very good acting.
Prank Neil, who has been uniformly fortu-
nate in hitting the public taste during the
last couple of years, finds the luck holding
with "The Gorilla” at the Grand Opera
House.

At Sydney Conservatorium on Monday
and Thursday of next week there are to be
“Grand Opera Concerts”—selections from
“Tristan and Isolde,” “I Pagliacci, “Tann-
hauser,” “Samson and Delilah,” “Lohen-
grin ” and others are to give an acquaint-
ance with a wide range of grand operas in a
potted form. Frank Rigo has organised the
event.
* * * #
After running “The Honeymoon Girl” for
three weeks at Sydney Fullers’ Jim
Gerald let loose “The Whirlwind of Youth.”
It is a less connected offering, blowing all
over the world, but the breezes are as fresh
and clean as in the first production. An
outline of the reversed matrimonial status of
1953 makes the most amusing seena; but
the whole thing moves briskly. Jim Gerald
of course, is the chief wliirly; but dancer
Ray McLean provides a cyclone on his own
account.
* * * *
Olsen and Johnson have gone, and, in an
entirely new Tivoli programme, Fred Bluett,
who babbles about goldfish and the rate-
payers’ money, is showing that he is as
capable as ever of stirring laughter. Hetty
King, returned after a long interval, is
given a fervent welcome, audiences being
particularly attached to “Fill-’em Up, Fill-
em Up, It Is My Birthday.” A returned
Australian, George Hurd, does some admir-
able juggling work. The only possible expla-
nation of his handling of three billiard cues
seems to be that they are magnetised; the
trick is only one of a boxful that bring cas-
cades of applause. The three Di Ganatons
provide a turn in which there is some real
dancing as well as vigorous acrobatics,
the Apache dance being a much wilder
specimen than usual. Sydney Tivoli has sel-
dom had a better programme; there are
others who on any normal bill would
deserve a special notice.
An ingenious but too-involved plot is pre-
sented in “The Price of Honor” at Syd-
ney Lyceum. An old man, instead of writing
a book to prove his thesis that circumstan-
tial evidence is unreliable, works his argu-
ment in real life, and, by committing suicide,
nearly secures the execution of an entirely
innocent young fellow who has a pressing love
affair in hand. “Firemen, Save My Child”
provides some knockabout comedy to temper
the thriller; the scenario-writer and the
players, who include an actor with the re-
freshing name of “Beery,” chase humor with
remarkable energy. The sophistry that
woman is man’s companion is given a sly
knock in “Lonesome Ladies,” screened with
“Captain Salvation” at Hoyt’s. The hus-
band is discovered at the start sitting with
liis wife, too bored to talk to her, whilst she
inwardly seethes at his dumbness; when
happiness” is again restored, after the mat-
rimonial barque has narrowly escaped foun-
dering, a picture of that uneasy opening
situation is flashed back on the screen. There
is a lesson to women who make excessive
demands upon their partners’ conversational
powers while lacking the faculty to be inter-
ested in the things that interest their hus-
bands ; but the woman who ought to see it
isn’t likely to. “The Flag Lieutenant” con-
tinues to do heroic deeds at the Prince
Edward, ‘The Seventh Heaven” remains at

Drawings and drypoints in Sydney :
In the exhibition of Fred C. Britton’s work shown
at the Macquarie Galleries the delightful drawings
stand out very distinctly from the etchings and dry-
points, which are inclined to an unnecessary harsh-
ness. The fact that the subjects are repeated in the
different mediums emphasises the superiority of the
drawings. In the pencil work “H.M.S. Renown in
Sydney Harbor” there is a touch of atmosphere
artfully caught also in “The Creek —Sunrise,” “Moon-
light” and “Summer Heat” ; and the sap rising in
the grass is suggested in “Spring in the Botanical
Gardens, Adelaide.” Of the drypoints “The Sunlit
Homestead” appeals most.

At the Adelaide Theatre Royal, “Cradle
Snatchers” continues to raise controversy
as. to whether sauce for the gander is a
fair thing for the goose, and if the point
remains unsettled the box office: doesn’t
mind. At the Prince of Wales, Muriel
Starr is presenting “The Man Who Cam"
Back”—to respectability and the paternal
mansion in New York after sampling the
roses and raptures of ’Frisco cabarets and
Shanghai opium-joints. Muriel Starr gives
a realistic study of the girl who, after
resorting to drugs, reforms herself and her
young husband under the influence of a more
compelling passion. Harvey Adams has one
of the old-man parts that fit him in the
millionaire dad, Frank Leighton makes ah
excellent Henry Potter, and Hilda Dorring-
ton is good as the managing aunt. At the
Majestic, the Bon Bon Revue-ers are still
handing out some capital musical sketches.
Joseph Ilislop made a hit with feminine
Adelaide and sang to overflowing houses,
but (alas for our reputed culture!) the song
about Six Cats with Five Eyes was always
the request item. West’s Pictures is given
over to hilarious comedy in “Finger Prints,”
with “The Heart of Salome” as the second
attraction. There is sport at the Wonder-
graph in “Casey at the Bat,” and Western
wildness in “The Land Beyond the Law.”
The York features circus doings in “The
Magic Flame” and in “Wild Beauty.” At
the Grand a couple of horses exhibit almost
human attributes upon the film.

A returned artist in Adelaide: —
Gordon Coutts, who is holding an exhibition of
paintings in the Dunster Galleries, has been absent
25 years from Australia, mostly in foreign lands; his
pictures reflect his travels. Figures and scenes in
Morocco, Tangier and Mexico are largely featured.
“From the Desert,” “The Brass Worker” and “The
Snake Charmer” are among the most interesting.
“Preparation for the Four Arts Ball in Paris” is
the most ambitious effort; there is a double effect
of artificial and evening light that is a masterpiece
in itself. The Adelaide Art Gallery has a picture
by this artist, “Too Late,” painted in 1894, the
figure of a priest gazing at the dead body of a boy.
“Wood’s Green” (Loud.) : There is strong
meat in “The Wolves,” adapted from the
French of Georges Toudouze, at the New
Theatre, so it is drawing well —London’s
taste runs to such things nowadays. In
a lonely spot on the Greenland coast a law-
less gang fights for the possession of a girl
rescued from an ice floe. That is the prin-
cipal scene, and the language is terrific.
Another show earning money for its pro-
prietors is “The One-Eyed Herring,” at
Wyndham’s. Bootleggers and other black-
guards are introduced in a haunted castle
in the Highlands, and Connie Ediss effects
their confusion.
“Cine Ma” : Contrasts? When Eva Novak,
Mayne Lynton and co. debouched on the
Speck and began re-enacting the early history
of that island, the Tasmanians smiled good-
humoredly and let them have their way.
When a Universal troupe repaired to the
Southern States of U.S.A. recently and
started filming “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” the
white Southerners arose in their wrath,
destroyed their sets, burned their boats, and
very nearly sent the cast to Heaven along
with little Eva.
“Irving Phelps” : Norman McKinnel, lead-
ing man with the Boucicaults, has a 30-year-
old record full of achievements. He has
been with Irving, Tree and other renowned
actor-managers, and among the parts he has
played are the Rev. James Morell in “Can-
dida,” John Anthony in Galsworthy’s
“Strife,” Oliver Blayds in Milne’s “The
Truth About Blayds,” and Solness in Ibsen's
“Master Builder.” A true Scot, despite his
English bearing, he has no national pre-
judices in art, and has disturbed inner circles
in Britain by declaring that the best produc-
tions of the Bard are German. Though
personally unassuming to the verge of shy-
ness, McKinnel is a big pot among theatrical
kettles. He is the first to appear with the
Boucicaults owning the right to have his
name published on all occasions in the same-
sized type as theirs.
Poverty
Point
THE HIGH COST OF MODELS.
HUNGRY ARTIST: “I say, old man, you ought to stick to painting Spanish onions or
something within reason if you don’t want people to say you’ve been cribbing.”
“Cauboy” : If the Melbourne season sue-
ceeds, there is a possibility of Count Filip-
pini’s Italo-Australian grand-opera company
developing into a permanent recurring enter-
tainment in all the capitals, like Allan
Wilkie. The Shakspearean interpreter, how-
over, has an advantage over Filippini. His
one and only author is dead, and if there
are descendants living they have mislaid the
family tree. Most of Filippini’s authors are
only just, defunct, and their heirs, being
very much alive, have to be fed with royal-
ties before the orchestra strikes up.
“F. Youth”: Hugh Ward’s career is be-
coming more and more of a zigzag. After
having been the kingpin in Williamson
affairs, he broke away when the Taits be-
came predominant. His coalition with
Fullers was taken to be a challenge to
J.C.W.. Ltd., and there was a show of
opposition, at least. Then Hugh parted
from Ben and John. Recently he gave
Sydney Empire people the benefit of his
experience and some other help. The latest
whisper is that he has a new theatrical
organisation in prospect.
“The Old Adam” : The advertisements of
“Rain,” now at Sydney Criterion, speak of
it as “Somerset Maugham’s vivid play.” Cer-
tainly Maugham wrote the magazine story
“Miss Thompson,” but it is hardly fair to
give him the credit or discredit of the stage
version. That was made by two American
hack writers. Maugham would have made
a better job of it. .
“Topee”: Johann Kruse, whose death in
England was recently reported, was one of the
earliest of Australia’s musical exports. The
son of a Melbourne chemist, Kruse went to
Europe to complete his violin studies and
after a Continental tour he was appointed
Koncertmeister to one of the German courts.
I heard him in Melbourne when he returned
nearly 40 years ago to give a series of
recitals. As he did not again visit Aus-
tralia, the name of Kruse to the present
generation is probably less associated with
music than with the insecticide which was
the foundation of the family fortune.
“Hamfat”: The name “Mrs. Armstrong.”
was on the programmes of the concerts which
late violinist Johann Kruse gave in the
Sydney Theatre Royal in July, ISBS. That
w r as practically Melba’s start. As a result of
those concerts she was asked to sing for the
Fhilharmonic Society at Christmas.
“Santander”: Irene Vanbrugh’s niece
Prudence, member of the Vanbrugh-Bouci-
cault co. which has opened in Melbourne in
“Caroline,” is already a substantial young
Miss in the theatrical world. Prudence
broke out early as Curley in “Peter Pan,”
and one of her later successes was as Mrs.
Darling in the same delightful fancy. She
has done much in Shakspeare, but her best
effort to date is her Princess Flavia in
“The Prisoner of Zenda.” She succeeded
the much-married Fay Compton in the
revival of the old piece at the London Hay-
market three years ago.
“Ancient Prompter” : “The Broken Wing”
w 7 as one of the plays in which Thurston Hall
appeared during his Australasian tour a few
years back. For some rekson or other the
piece was never seen in Sydney. It is now
to be produced at the Palace, with Peter
Gawthorne in Thurston Hall’s part. The
comic-opera story will on. this occasion be
given with songs by most bf the principals.
“Cmsar’s Ghost”: Frank Neil is going
further than providing a children’s show (P».
20/10/’27) ; his “Mother Goose” panto, is to
run two sessions, one starting at 11 a.m. and
the other at 2.30 p.m. With his comedy
company playing at night—the piece is to be
“Up in Mabel’s Room” —Sydney Opera House
will be kept busy earning money. And “The
Gorilla” co. will be bringing in some coin
elsewhere. At the moment Neil has his
comedy co., with himself missing, on tour.
“Flaming Youth” : Next year the Fullers
will produce some fresh ventures; and the
extra theatre may yet go on the top of the
uncompleted St. James building in Sydney.
Ben and John are now able to keep all their
theatres going, although some of the plays
they secured—“ Rain” and “Is Zat So?” for
instance —have been passed over to the Wil-
liamsons for production. From the point of
view of popularity, the Fuller shows have
been shrewdly chosen. “Rio Rita,” the next
production, will not detract from the family’s
reputation for good picking.
“M.G.S.”: “Cauboy’s” par. about Ignaz
Friedman listening to Kaai’s Hawaiians
reminded me that I once travelled across
Germany with a saloon-carful of virtuosi.
According to the rules of the game, they
should have been talking about tlieir Art in
relation to their Souls. But I didn’t need
even a smattering of languages to know that
they were furiously debating the relative
merits of Argentine railways and Mexican
oil as an avenue for investment.
“Hamfat”: The Noo Yoick run of “Abie’s
Irish Rose” closed with 2327 consecutive
performances, which beats the “Lightnin”’
record of 1291 out of sight, and is better
than the London run of “Chu-Chin Chow”
—2238 performances. The unreal, sentimen-
tal slush, which has made a big fortune
for au authoress previously poverty-stricken,
did not go down in London. But it is still
running in Australian provincial theatres
after going for 15 months. Indeed, it is
likely to have metropolitan revivals.
“Adam Ant”: Betty Ross Clark, who
travelled in “The Ghost Train” during its
recent journeying, opened in Perth with
C. J. Dennis’s “Sentimental Bloke.” Warde
Morgan, who was badly smashed in the
Aberdeen (N.S.W.) railway accident, is
the Bloke.
“Ilasen”: Hollywood shows a pathetic
loyalty to old ideas. Since the first unin-
spired genius “shot” his hero in a thrilling
leap from one moving object to another,
lie has been plagiarised innumerable times.
Thousands of cowboys have clambered
on to trains from the saddle; thousands
of other screen characters have changed
motor-cars in transit. And yet stepping
from one vehicle to another moving at
approximately the same speed is, in
reality, as simple as stepping from the kerb
to the gutter. It is not nearly so difficult
as being first off a Sydney ferry, nor so
dangerous as boarding a dashing Melbourne
cable-tram in action. It’s in the disparity
of speeds, not in the speeds themselves, that
difficulty or danger lies. Bui Hollywood
will continue to produce such rubbish until
the people wake up.
“Santander”: Australia’s own Harry
Plimmer has the part of Tracy Tupman in a
lavish presentation of “Pickwick” at the
Empire Theatre, New York. The production
is the work of one Reilly, who can fill a
bank from his earnings as the patentee of
a certain electric sky-sign. It is his amiable
vice to spend his money on the demonstration
of Dickens’s genius-; he is said to have the
finest collection of Dickens relics and sou-
venirs in existence. Cosmo Hamilton, author
of “Scandal,” assisted him in preparing “Pick-
wick” for the stage. It has a cast of 55
characters.
“Irving Phelps”: After “Caroline,” the
Bouci-Vanbrughs are to do “The Letter,” in
which Gladys Cooper has been exercising her
powers of restraint for quite a while in Lon-
don. Perhaps Irene Vanbrugh likes a bit
of change from the sweet moods of Caroline.
If that is her view, Leslie, in “The Letter,”
will offer her all the change she might de-
sire. She starts the play by emptying an
automatic into her lover, and it takes three
acts to elicit from her that the motive for the
murder is jealousy of the Chinese woman
with Whom he has been consorting. A typi-
cal Maugham Asiatic theme on the murkier
plane of melodrama.
“Hamfat”: Singing-master and baritone
Arthur Appleby, who has been given a bene-
fit at Sydney Con., has been teaching the
young idea how to shoot up the scale for
many years. A Maorilander, he learnt to
sing in Christchurch Cathedral choir, lie
won a piano scholarship with the Royal
Academy of Music in the ’nineties, which
took him to England, but it was liis voice
he wanted to exploit. He got his first stage
engagement in London with George Edwards
and understudied Hayden Coffin in “The
Geisha” at the Prince of Wales Theatre.
It was the Meynell-Gunn “Miss Hook of
Holland” co. that brought him to Australia,
where lie has stayed ever since.
“Cauboy” : Madge Mclntosh, who appeared
here in melodrama 20 years ago. is back again
with a new evangel. It is that melodrama
will come into its own again upon the legiti-
mate stage. If it does it will have to beat
the • screen at a game the screen has made
its own. When did Blandolt stage anything
as realistic as the hunt for the demented
whale in “The Sea Beast”? A few supers
in borrowed evening dresses sitting round a
rickety table are a poor substitute for such
a scene as the cabaret in “Variety.” Miss
Mclntosh should exchange notes on the sub-
ject with Muriel Starr. That lady created
a furore when she appeared in “Within the
Law 7 ,” in pre-war days in Melbourne. When
she tried to repeat the performance the other
day with “East Lynne,” as well as some
modern melodramas, the public indifference
was immense. The movies in the interim
had done their wicked work.
“The Listening-Insect”: Australian broad-
casting stations are not only big employers
of mummers, but they are becoming
liberal patrons of the dramatists as well.
Melbourne’s 3LO recently announced a
competition for one-act plays. Over 1000
specimens arrived, some from listeners as far
away as Manila, and many of them were of
literary merit. The radio drama demands
an entirely new technique. “The Monkey s
Paw r ,” by W. W. Jacobs, is an excellent
example. One needs to listen-in to this
with the lights out while the mind recon-
structs the character and the scene.
“Wang”; In our seaside suburb a hard-
faced party had a tent erected on the beach,
with a notice in large letters: “.Come in and
see the Great Hiatus.” He was rushed
at sixpence a time. The tent contained a
big empty box. The mugs (nearly, all city
people) were too ashamed to admit they’d
been “had,” but the police told the pro-
prietor of the Great Hiatus to get to Sheol
out of that —it was all they could do.
THE RISKS THEY RUN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
■‘Mr. Marks interpolated a story of how he had
seen a leading lady obliged to kiss a man suffering
from tuberculosis 25 times, and every time she went
away at once to wash her mouth and throat with dis-
infectant. ‘No wonder they get big salaries, the risks'
they have to take,’ he said.’’ —Report of Film Com-
mission.
These stage embraces cause profound
Emotion in the gallery miss,
The girls account them worth a pound,
At least, a kiss.
But had you seen the thing that fell
’Neath Mr. Marks’s observation
Thoughts such as his it might compel:
They ought to pay the lady well
For osculation.
Though Daisy Dipps or Dolly Dapps
Should dollars by the thousand clutch
Each week for screw, bethink —perhaps
’Tis none too much.
It may appear above the marge
For mummery, r i one discerns it,
A startlingly excessive charge;
But, taking all things by and large,
Maybe she earns it.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MALCOLM fills his house Avith sunshine,
Being neither sour nor surly,
As lie rises bright and early
In the grey o’ the morning.
Breakfast o’er, Avith axe on shoulder,
Tall and broAvn, and lithe and limber,
He fares forth into the timber
Ere the sun’s rays, adorning
Hill and hollow, light the dewdrops,
There Avith ringing blade to labor,
Waking sleeping bird and neighbor
From the deeps of their slumbers.
As his keen axe falls and rises,
Forth he sends a song of gladness;
For his spirit, free of sadness,
Ne’er a worry encumbers.
Toiling so, the sunrays cheer him;
Cheer him, too, the waking thrushes
And the birds in river-rushes,
With their sweet notes outchorused.
Thus he labors, labors gladly,
Seldom resting, never dreaming,
With his axe-blade brightly gleaming
In the green o’ the forest.
SAveat upon his arms and forehead,
When the hour of noon has found him
Stands he there, with all around- him,
Tree and log, felled and cloven.
Yet he knoAvs while he is toiling
That his wife at home is churning
(’ream to butter, or is turning
Flour to bread in her oven.
Home he goes to wife at hearthside
When the sun sinks down in splendor
And long shadows, soft and tender,
All its glory are leav’ning.
With his axe upon his shoulder,
Tall and brown, and lithe and limber,
Sloav he trudges through the timber
In the red o’ the ev’ning.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ A NYBODY knowing the AvhereaboUts
of Joseph Spence, formerly of Blake-
ford-Street, Kensington, please ask
him to communicate with his brother at once,
at the Duchess of York Hotel, Melbourne.
Matter urgent.”
Joseph Spence at that moment was at
Denbeigh, 140 miles out of Melbourne. He
had come thither with his AVife eight years
before, after he had realised on the stock
and goodAvill of a business carried on in his
own and his brother’s name in a Melbourne
suburb. At present he was the proprietor
of the general store and post office in the
main street of Denbeigh. It Avas a dreary
little place. The business community con-
sisted of a barber, Avho ran a billiard saloon
on the side; Mick Phelan, licensee of the
local pub; Tom Elliot, who had slioAvn his
progressiveness by opening a garage and
service station Avitli a petrol bowser; a
Avatchmaker and jeweller, whose dirty little
AvindoAv was full of second-hand silver
watches Avith fly-blown price-tickets; a black-
>mith ; the proprietor of a butter-factory—
ihat Avas the sum total. No visitor ever
:emained in Denbeigh longer than was
necessary to fill a petrol-tank or under
durance of engine-trouble.
Bill Spence, the elder brother who had
broadcast the message, had enlisted early
in 1915. Three years later he had been
posted as “missing.” Eventually all trace
of him had been lost; and there Avere good
reasons Avhy, to Joe, this should have been
a matter of relief. In fact, it simplified a
situation that had become increasingly
strained. For Bill’s money had been the
mainstay of the suburban business; and it
Avas gone. Moreover, the Avoman who had
pledged herself to aAvait Bill’s return Avas
now Joe’s Avife. And this was a fact which
she had long and increasingly regretted.
Death, it seemed had opportunely cut the
knot; for as the Aveeks went by and length-
ened into months, and inquiry brought no
tidings, it Avas taken for granted that Bill
Avas numbered amongst those Avho would
never return. And iioav out of the night came
this voice from the past. The arroAv shot
at a venture from the broadcasting station
had found its mark.
Joe and his Avife sat in the living-room
behind the shop listening-in when the bolt
from the blue fell. The reaction to the
shock was characteristic of each. Joe went
the color of chalk. Alma gave a startled cry.
“It can’t be right,” said Joe, desperately.
“He is dead, I tell you—dead. Somebody is
putting it over us.” But he spoke with-
out conviction.
“What is the motive?” asked Alma quietly.
“And, in any case, we can easily find out.”
“But why? Why not let it rest? What's
the good of raking it all up again?”
Alma looked at him fixedly, lie was under-
sized. and his unshaven chin and general
untidiness betrayed a man Avho had gone to
seed. She continued the scrutiny, and Joe,
not for the first time, felt himself being
weighed and found wanting. Then she said:
“We can get the train to-morrow morning.
It Avill reach Spencer-street about three.”
“We?” said Joe, feebly. “Why we? The
message was for me. If anybody goes, I’m
going.”
“And I’m going Avith you. I oAve him that,
at least. And we might as well stay for a
day or tAvo. I can ring mother up when
Ave get to town. It’s time I had a change,
anyway. And I Avant to do some shopping.
So that’s settled.”
Joe sat huddled in his chair. He was
badly shaken.
The Syncopating Symphonists began to
play “I've Never Seen a Straight Banana.”
Alma, with a swift movement of impatience,
sAvitclied off the Avircless. Then she resolutely
faced Joe.
“Here, you.” she said, “pull yourself
together. I believe you're frightened of
Bill. I believe you’re sorry he lias turned
up.”
"The hell I am!” retorted Joe, his voice
shaking. “But. .. .but”....
"That will do. Oli, I can read you like
a book. But I'd like to see Bill again if
you wouldn’t. Anyway, he was a man.’
“More dirt,” muttered Joe. “If you want
to know, I believe you’re hankering after
him still.” „
“And if I am?” she flamed. Can you
blame me? Has our life been anything
to write home about since I gave him up—
for you?”
Joe quailed before the blast. “Well, he
said at length, “What does he want?”
“Want?” She stood before him, her hands
upon her hips, bitter scorn on her lips.
“Want? Perhaps he wants to see your
beautiful face again—though God knows
why. Perhaps lie wants to settle up over
the business —he had money in it, you know.
Pity the horse always ran stiff. But, after
all this time, he may have forgotten that —
and other things. Yes; lie’s had time to
forget everything.” She twisted her fingers,
and, when she spoke again, it was in a
voice that was barely heard. “I might have
waited even till I thought he was dead.
But as things are”....
Joe poked the fire viciously. _ The act
gave him needed courage. “Yes,” lie mut-
tered, “Bill always had the luck of it.”
As soon as he had spoken lie was appalled.
For the woman’s face was filled with
loathing.
“I want to know just what you mean, she
said with deadly quiet.
Joe took up the poker again, and ran it
along the bars. But lie found no words.
“I’m waiting to know just what you
meant,” slie reminded him.
“Oh,” said Joe, “it was a poor attempt at
a joke. I really didn’t mean anything. But
—old girl, I reckon that we both made a
mistake.”
“We?” she laughed, mirthlessly. “You—
you worm! I should like you to tell me
where you would have been without me,
anyway.”
* * * *
Bill Spence was passing through Mel-
bourne cn route to Sydney and a Wool-
buyers’ Conference. As he had a few hours
between trains lie had endeavored to get
in touch with his younger brother. lie soon
found that Joe had left liis old address. The
business* had changed hands, and, beyond the
vague information that Joe had gone up-
country, lie could not ascertain his where-
abouts. Hence he had broadcast the mes-
sage that had brought such perturbation to
the inmates of the back parlor at Denbeigh.
Bill, as he turned the pages of a week-
old paper in the hotel smoking-room, re-
viewed the last twelve years. He thought
of his brother without bitterness. Indeed,
it seemed such a far call to the pre-war
years that he found himself viewing the past
with a curious detachment. He reflected,
half ruefully, that Joe had been a weakling
always. But he was his only surviving re-
lative in Australia, and blood was thicker
than water. His feeling towards his brother
was a queer mixture of affection and con-
tempt. His was one of those natures which
could not harbor malice ; but his smile was
a twisted one as his mind travelled back
through the years that the locust had eaten.
He had gone over to the other side as a
matter of plain duty. That no such duty
had presented itself to Joe his tolerance had
accepted. He did not set up to be a judge
of motives. Moreover, a kind of instinctive
protectiveness towards the younger and
weaker man was natural to one who had
long stood in the place almost of a father
to the orphaned boy. So it Avas settled
quietly that Joe should stay home and look
after the business. That any element of
treachery was present he had no suspicion.
On his last night on leave he and his
brother had stood for a few moments in the
closed shop. Bill Avas not a man given to
introspection. But his mood Avas sober as
he looked at the old place—perhaps, he re-
flected, for the last time.
He put his hand on his brother’s shoulder.
“Joe. old man, carry on Avliile I’m away.
And be good to the little girl—you know.”
“Righto, Bill: I’ll see to everything—don’t
you worry. And I'll look after her.”
“Good business, old man,” he said, and
switched off the light.
As Alma clung to him that night at the
gate she seized the lapel of his coat and
looked at him with her soul in her eyes.
“Bill,'’ she whispered, “you'll not forget?
“Forget?” said Bill. “Not till Hell
freezes.”
And lie had kissed her passionately. I luit
there could be any forgetfulness on her side
it had never occurred to him to think.
The memory of the girl he loved kept Bill
true to his straight, clean self. He was a
man among men, and, with an added incen-
tive to excel, rose first to non-commissioned
rank and eventually, mentioned in despatches
for conspicuous bravery—he had captured a
particularly poisonous machine-gun emplace-
ment near a Avindmill —Avas gazetted as
second-lieutenant.
Meanwhile, the course of true love had
begun to run deviously. A note of con-
straint had crept into Alma’s letters. One
day the mailbag contained no letter for him.
Joe Avas at best a poor correspondent. But
a letter curiously stilted and full of evasion
came from him as Bill Avas in the midst of
a particularly bad spell of cold and drizzle.
Bill read it. and re-read it. Then lie took
the cherished butt of a gasper from behind
his ear and began to think. The time and
place Avere not propitious to thoughts that
were happy. He read the letter a third time,
and was alarmed to feel a tiny prick of
jealousy. Joe had been as good as his word.
He Avas certainly looking after Alma. She
avou ld not be too lonely. Would she he lonely?
A General Order to prepare for action
put the affair opportunely from Bill’s mind.
Events trod on each other’s heels, and it
was another fortnight before the barb of sus-
picion pricked him again. He found himself
thinking fixedly about a belated letter from
the girl full of excuses Avhich failed to con-
vince.
Then came a day Avhen Bill fought all the
devils in hell. He read this: “Forgive me,
Bill dear, but I didn’t know. ... It is better

wife than I ever c0u1d.... Joe feels it very
much, seeing that you and he have always
been such pals: but what is the use of spoil-
ing three lives?”
Bill had learnt the truth at last. The
bitter hate which surged through him made
him afraid of himself. He set out deliber-
ately to seek death. It was, he considered in
his rage and misery, the only thing left to
do. Volunteers were called for a recon-
noitring stunt that was practically an invi-
tation to suicide. He regarded it as a Heaven-
sent opportunity. He threw away his identi-
fication-disc and crawled into a thick fog.
lie did not return. In due course he was
posted as missing. Then be became officially
dead. To Joe. shivering at the thought of
stored-up retribution, it was a happy solu-
tion. To Joe’s wife it was a blinding reve-
lation —of Joe, of herself and of the worth
to which she had been disloyal. It would be
hard to say which suffered most. For Joe
began to hate his brother with all the venom
of which a man is capable towards one whom
he has wronged.
With Bill it was otherwise. He had
sought death, and found a German prison-
camp. With the lapse of time his stoicism
came to his rescue. Moreover, he discovered
that life was sweet, and he began to plan
for liberty. He had always been clever at
picking up dialects. He added colloquial
German to his accomplishments. Eventually
he escaped. It was an epic of adventure that
overlaid his self-communings with a film of
new memories. A spell of thirty-six hours
lying prone in a turnip-field, his food con-
sisting of a raw egg, was one of many
episodes. There came a time when he was
able to recall the past with a detachment
which surprised him. In contrast with the
Odyssey of his wanderings—for he escaped
through Holland—the pre-war days seemed
unreal, tie was in hospital when the Armi-
stice came. It was double pneumonia and
a strained heart. The screens were round
him twice. Learning subsequently that he
was posted as officially dead, he decided to
remain so. He did not feel cast for the
part of Enoch Arden.
A wartime friendship secured liis employ-
ment with a Bradford firm. His demobbed
friend, who had an interest, was glad of the
opportunity to be of service. He had risen
rapidly, and it was in connection with the
business of the firm that he was now back
in Australia. And the impulse had come
to him to seek his brother again. The old
wound had healed. But this time it was
Joe that was missing. There was just the
chance that a broadcast message would find
him. He would wait in till half-past three.
This would give him time to transact some
private business and to catch the Limited.
* * * *
Bill, bronzed and square, his hair whitened
at the temples, rose as they entered the room.
He noted with momentary surprise that
Alma had accompanied his brother. But
he had learnt in a hard school to control his
features, and. apart from a slight and barely
perceptible start, his self-possession was un-
shaken.
But self-possession was miserably wanting
in Joe; and in attempting to smile, he
only succeeded in looking unhappy and
rather frightened.
Bill, master of himself and of the situ-
ation, advanced with outstretched hand and
a disarming smile.
But it was Alma who spoke first— rather
hurriedly. “Why, Bill," she said, “I
wouldn’t have known you. - ’
Bill lied valiantly. “You haven't altered
a bit,” he said.
In truth, the years had dealt hardly with
Alma. Her vivid, rather piquant, prettiness
had faded. Disappointment and constant
fretting over the limitations of a small-town
life —secretly she indulged social ambitions
-—had left their mark. Bill noted the pathetic
attempts at finery; the somewhat strained
effort to be vivacious. Wonder smote him
that this little country mouse, so essentially
commonplace, should ever have held his hap-
piness in her hands. He realised how com-
pletely he had put her out of his life.
Meanwhile, as once before, Alma’s eyes
sought his with an eagerness wistful and
pathetic. But they did not find what they
sought. The wan smile on her face died
away. She suddenly looked tired and old.
“You have altered,” she said, while her
lips trembled—“in more ways than one.”
He bent, and kissed her, with pity in his
heart. The gesture was one of pity, not
forgiveness. He had forgiven her long ago.
This was more than Alma could bear. Just
what she had expected she could not have
said. But she had not expected a detach-
ment so complete that Bill seemed like a
visitor from another planet. Her control
gave way, and Alma wept.
“Here, old girl,” said Joe, with a feeble
and unconvincing attempt at raillery. “Cut
it out, can’t you? Nice way to welcome old
Bill after all these years.”
Poor Joe! He had fallen so completely
into the background that his existence had
been forgotten. Now that he recalled himself
to notice, Alma levelled on him a glance
of scathing contempt. “Oh,” she said, "buzz
off, you little fool.” As a foil to Bill, she
felt him at that moment to be insupportable.
The little man was stung to the quick.
His attempt at proprietorship had been con-
tumeliously scorned. His standing as a hus-
band had simply not been recognised. His
self-esteem had been wounded almost to
death. At that moment he hated Alma, he
hated Bill, and it was no help that he
secretly despised himself. But he made a
desperate effort to recover his dignity. _ With
a spasm of courage that astonished himself,
he swallowed, and said huskily: “Bill, about
that money I owe you?”
Alma looked up with a startled gasp.
Bill smiled on him—and Alma saw that
it was a smile of pity.
“Old man,” he said, “you owe me nothing.”
Joe suddenly felt himself reprieved—at a
price. Henceforward he would never escape
the memory that Bill had put him under an
obligation—that Bill, in fact, had scored at
every point, leaving him no shred to cover
the nakedness of his humiliation.
Indeed, as the big man looked at the pair
before him, there was no room in his heart
for anger. Life, with its pitiless irony, had
wrought its own revenge—a revenge that
was more than adequate. The tables were
turned completely. With no feeling save that
of goodwill, lie. felt ashamed at having wit-
nessed so abject a humiliation. He remem-
bered his duty as a host. But even as he
moved towards the bell, Alma divined
intention. s ‘No thanks, Bill, she said; we
must really be going.” .
She extended her hand: Bill grasped it
warmly in his own. Joe held out his hand
in turn, his face averted; and they hurried
from the room.
Bill stood quietly watching the door
through which they had gone. Then he lit
a cigarette, held it between his fingers,
turned and abruptly threw it into the fire-
place.
“Poor devils!” he said. Then he added
cryptically. “Perhaps all is for the best in
this worst of all possible worlds.”
On the way to the station he posted a
letter to his wife.
WAWHERESH.
“A Woman of Samaria.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHE looked dully at the camp. The dying
sun touched everything with color; in
a leafy gum some birds poured out
their hearts’ song. Yet the sun only painted
the river bend starker; the desolate camp
more desolate; mounds of bare earth and
piles of old kerosene tins the more hideous.
The song of the birds was far from her
ears. In a near-by tent a woman’s voice
rose stridently; came the sobbing wail of a
child. A group of youngsters were quarrel-
ling; the boys’ voices already laden with
brutishness, the girls’ all too soon harsh
and bitter.
Her haggard face set. The pale eyes grew
glassy ; the lean mouth rigid. She flung back
the tent-flap and shuffled in.
* * * *
A wisp of moon shone kindly on the
river bend ; hiding its suffering, adorning its
glory. A man lurched against the tent, tore
back the flap; entered. The woman drew
the blanket round her shoulders.
“That you, John?”
“Course it’s me.”
He bent over her, gripped the bony arm.
“Where’s the money you had?”
Her clenched teeth grated; she tasted the
warm blood from her tongue.
“But we want that, John. It’s for the” —
“I asked you where it was.”
He drew her upwards, his Angers biting
into the quivering arm, the hot fume-laden
breath playing upon her face.
“Now, where is it?”
“But. John”
The hand on her shoulder shifted to her
throat, stifling the scream that rose from
the sunken breast. His free hand smashed
into the wan face.
“Now say where it is.”
Feebly she plucked at the hand on her
throat. He let her go, and stood over her.
She groped into the few clothes she wore,
and pressed a note into his hand.
“Is that all?”
“There were only a few pennies over the
pound, John”
“This'll do. then.” He wiped the blood
from his hands. “Next time you'll hand it
over quicker.’’
She shrank away from him and a raucous
laugh burst from his thick lips. “I'll teach
yer, me lady.”
He went out into the moonlight, his
throaty chuckle cleaving the silence.
The woman lay inert for a while, her pair
eyes glowing in the soft darkness. A faint
throb bing as of a motor came to her ears.
It struck her with a dull wonder that what-
ever her pain, whatever her agony, life still
went on. Whether a strand of gossamer or
a rope of hate, alway the mill of life spun
out its length.
She began to dress, her numbed fingers
in keeping with her soul.
This was the end. Life in the camp with
John was a lasting hell ; one long agony.
The open road held happiness somewhere:
somewhere in life was peace and content.
In some place ahead the light of the sun
was in people’s breasts; the song of the
birds in their hearts.
She groped in the darkness. Carefully
putting her few things in the blanket.
Then she heard the crunch of sand.
John was coming back.
Fear stared naked in the strained eyes.
Her mouth was clamped and dry; her hands
immovable. Slowly the pent-up breath
hissed between her teeth.
This was Old Ben. Hadn’t she heard
that wheezing cough often?
He came to the tent opening; peered in.
“Jean. Awake, Jean?”
“What is it?”
His querulous voice had a note of appeal
in it. “Come over to Mary’s—she’s calling
for y’.”
“Isn’t there anyone else in the camp?”
Sudden confusion made him stutter.
“B-but y-you’ve always helped with tli’
kids. An’ Mary’s baby’s come.”
She stood up, the glow of hate still in her
eyes.
“Let someone else have a go—l'm sick
of it all.”
“B-but who else can we get?”
“Who y’ like.”
She gave the rope around the blanket
a vicious pull.
“Get to Hell out of this.”
The old man shuffled away. His wizened
features moulded in the cast of despair.
The woman jerked the swag to her
shoulder, rattled a few pence and went firmly
into the night.
The moon shed a ghostly light; it seemed
to people the world with shadows. Jus;
ahead of her a light gleamed. Mary’s tent.
She turned resolutely from it. Across %
shadow space came a whimper. As though
some lost soul were seeking peace and found
it not.
Jean stood irresolute. Hate and love
fought in the breast.
Again that whimper. The feeble cry of a
newly-born child, pleading.
The glow of hate died away. The narrow
breast rose and fell. And slowly she went
her way into the tent.
