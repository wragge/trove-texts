THE BED PAGE OF VILLON.
WHEN Swinburne was making translations
from Villon, and came to the‘Balladeof the
Ladies of Old Time,’ he noted that this had been
‘ incomparably ’ rendered by D. G. Rossetti, and
P cssed to the ‘ Lords ’ without venturing another
version. One might think it as daring to attempt
rivalry with Swinburne as with Rossetti, yet in
the late and lamented ‘Savoy Magazine ’ Theo-
d'>re Wratislaw had so much hardihood. He
turned into English the famous Ballade of the
Gibbet, and indeed the result has justified him,
though Swinburne’s version remains supreme.
14 ere are the two for comparison with the text.
(The illustration—imaginative, surely?—of the
f<mrehes patibulaires at Montfaucon, whence the
bodies of anti-social persons swung year after
year, is also owed to ‘The Savoy.’)
Swinburne seems the truer in form and feeling
as well as in phrase,: he is a better interpreter of
Villon’s strange soul. Wratislaw paraphrases as
much as he translates; and the beginning of
paraphrasing is as the letting out of waters.
Thus he has lost ‘cinq, six ’ from the first stanza,
and in replacing them in the second he has lost
‘se vous clamons.’ And ‘hideous shapes’ is
nowhere in Villon, And—so on. Swinburne has
varied the original in one important place only:
for the image of bodies pecked by birds till they
are dented like thimbles he has substituted bodies
pecked like fruit on a wall—which is an excellent
simile, yet not the original, and questionably as
good as the original. Probably to lessen a little
the force of the Swinburnian comparison, Wratis-
law has adopted an alternative envoy for which
there is authority. But there does not seem any
authority for his
Have naught to say to them that with us vie—
which, indeed, is an incomprehensible line in any
case. What does ‘ vie ’ mean in such connection ?
The ballade text here given is that of P. L.
Jacob (pub. Jannet, Paris, 1854), and it is evi-
dently that which Swinburne followed. (Villon
seems throughout his work as corrupt as the most
corrupt classic, with a fine field for philologers’
emendations.) But neither Jacob, Swinburne,
nor Wratislaw has suggested an envoy text which
the authorities warrant, and which yields the best
meaning of all. In this the lines
Hommes, icy n’usez de moequerie,
in the third stanza, and
Ne soyez done de nostre confrairie
envoy, would bes transposed. The ‘done’ of ‘Ne soyez done’ follows more naturally on the recapitulation of ills in the third stanza; the
v,- I n -t r< v ni j k l 6 .°PP 0! j lt, o n of Prince Jesus and ‘Homines’; and various nuances of suggestion come as buttresses of the transposition—
which, be it noted again, actually occurs in some authorities.
THE EPITAPH
In form of a ballad, which Villon made for himself and
his comrades, expectin,g to bp hanged, along with
them.
Men, brother men, that after us yet live,
Let not your hearts too hard against us be ;
For if some pity of us poor men ye give,
Thfe sooner God ahail take of you pity.
Here are we five or six strung up, you see,
And here the flesh that all too well we fed
Bit by bit eaten and rotten, rent and shred,
1 And we the bones grow dust and ash withal)
Let no man laugh at us discomforted,
But pray to God that He forgive us all.
If we call on you, brothers, to forgive,
Ye should not hold our prayer in scorn, though we
Were slain by law ; ye know’ that all alive
( Have not wit alwaj to walk rjghteoualy ;
Make therefore intercession hekrtily
With Him that of a virgin’s womb was bred,
That His graoe be not as a dry well-head
For us, nor let Hell’s thunder on us fall;
We are dead, let no man harry or vex us dead,
But pray to God that He forgive us all.
The rain has washed and laundered us all five,
And the sun dried and blackened ; yea. perdie,
Ravens and pies with beaks that rend and rive
Have dug our eyes out, and plucked off for fee
Our beards and eyebrows ; never are we free,
Not once, to rest, but here and there still sped,
Drive at its wild will by the wind’s change led,
More pecked of birds than fruits on garden-wall;
Men, for God’s love, let no gibe here be said,
But pray to God that He forgive us all.
Prince Jesus, that of all art lord and head,
Keep us, that hell be not our bitter bed ;
We have nought to do in suoh a master’s hall.
Be not ye therefore of our fellowhead,
But pray to God that He forgive us all.
A. C. Swinburne.

Francois Villon
THE EPITAPH
In form, of a Ballade, which Villon made for himself
and his companions when expecting to be hanged
■ with them.
Brothers who yet are living, mortal men,
Speak not of us with wrath and bitter tongue,
Since if your souls for us are filled with pain
The more will God’s grace fall your hearts among.
You see us here upon the gibbets hung:
The fl sh that we too much did glorify
Has longr been putrid and devoured : and dry
As dust and ashes now our bleached bones be.
Let no man I hen our hideous shapes decry,
But pray that God may show us all mercy.
Brottiers speak not, we pray you, with disdain
Of us poor five or six by law’ upstrung.
It is not every man who has his brain
Clear and well seated, as has oft been sung.
Make ye then intercession for our wrong
To Him whose death from Hell our souls did buy,
Saving us from the flames that never die,
That fresh may flow the fount of His pity.
We are dead: let none to vex our spirits try,
But pray that God may show us all mercy.
Our bodies have been washed and drenched by rain,
Dried up and blackened by the sun ; a throng
Of ravens and of crows our eyes have ta’en,
And pluckt the brows and beards whereto they clung.
Never are we at rest, forever swung
By every wind that shifts and passes by,
Pecked by the sharp beaks of the crow and pye
And dinted like a thimble, as you see.
Have naught to say to them that with us vie,
But pray that God may show us all mt rcy.
Prince Jesus, Lord who reignest in the s y,
Grant that to Hell’s fierce mouth we draw’not nigh:
Tow aid such a place no love or wish have we.
Men, mock i ot ns because we hang so high,
But pray that God may show us all mercy.
Theodore Wratislaw.
Francis Villon, ‘ student, poet, and house-
breaker,’ was born at Paris in 1431. The date of
his death is unknown ; but his life was doubtfully
as short as it was merry and miserable. In disso-
lute, reckless fashion, he let it run whither it
would, and occasionally it led him whither he
would not—if he could have helped himself. But,
having set the ball rolling gaily, he had no right
to whine when it rolled over him. He did whine—
a good deal; sometimes, maybe, with his tongue
in his cheek, but oftener earnestly enough, as he
had reason.
**♦-**
Not much is known of Villon, and for most of
that there is only his own word to take. It doesn’t
always look as reliable a word as it might be.
These things are fairly certain : at 17 he became a
student at Paris University, and at 21 he was
Master of such Arts as the University possessed,
To them Villon added many owed to his own
ingenuity. He had a native knack of verses, and
just enough scholarship to sharpen it. When he
wasn’t writing verses he was studying women—as
closely as he could ; and the memory of a fearful
thrashing he got through one of his subjects lasted
him for life. Also, he knocked a priest on the
head with a big stone, and killed him ; he was
memberof an attractive gang of thieves, and helped
to rob a church ; and before he was thirty
he was as near hanged for his ill-deeds as
is consistent with not being hanged after all. And
all the time he was weaving his experiences into
verses and more verses. All his experiences—
with a wealth of detail when ladies are in question
which makes Robert Louis Stevenson blush for
him, and Swinburne substitute stars for words
when translations reach the crises,
Because Villon wasn’t hanged he was banished
—out of Paris; and he got into trouble in the
country just as in the city. A bishop of Orleans
put him in a big holer—deep, damp, and damnable
—and fed him with proper episcopal economy. If
Louis Eleventh had not begun to reign just then,
and set a few prisoners free to rejoice in his good
fortune, there would have been little left of
either Villon or his poetry. But they let down a
basket into the big hole, and up Villon came and
started to put his masterpiece on paper in consecu-
tive form—no doubt he had meditated or written
scraps of it before. And the rest is silence.
* * * *
Villon is easier read about than read. His
French is old French; his text, as beforemen-
tioned, is delightfully corrupt ; and he was such
a treasurehouse of thieves’ slang and brothel-slang
that even Frenchmen query him. But it is well
worth while puzzling him out of context and
glossary. He is splendidly alive—tingling with
vigor and hearty devil-may-carelessness; and his
scholarship comes to aid his experience in all
manner of flavoury quips. He is the ‘prince of
all ballade-makers’—nobody else has ever got such
force out of that .stiff form. And he has humor
and pathos, and that popular, come-home-to
everybody philosophy whose staple is eloquent
regret that wild oats don’t bloom perennially.
MillP. Dreyfus, of Melbourne, by the- inexact
summary of Villon’s work in her recently-pub-
lished ‘ Lectures on French Literature,’somewhat
helps the impression that much of her criticism
oomes less from original study than per the
primrose paths of Saint-Beuve and Nisard and
similar classical commentators. She says (p. 79)
that ‘ Irrespective of his ballads, this roystering
poet wrote two other pieces: ‘ The Little Testa-
ment,’ in 1456, which contained his farewell and
his legacies to his friends; and his ‘Great
Testament,’ composed in the maturity of
his powers and of his life,’ etc. Which
is obscure, at least. For the best of Villen’s
ballads are set in his ‘Grand Testament’ as
stones in a brooch, and merely change the form
of the verse to give more force or variety to a run-
ning argument. This Great Testament was
written or collected when Villon came out of the
big hole, and it enshrines all the best of him.
There is a previous Little Testament, written
before he went into the hole —less in quality as
well as quantity. Evidently, however the hole
hurt the man, it did a lot of good to the poet.
Our songsters and such nowadays often bury
themselves in solitary remoteness to beat the
music out of the reluctant flesh : like the wild
animals they are. when the huntress Muse has
wounded them they yearn to leave the tribe and
die alone. Thus, at the time of Hubert Crackan-
thorpe’s disappearance, his friends thought he had
gone into the wilderness to be preyed upon.
Couldn’t something modern be done with a big
hole? Even if the damp did kill a Nocent Non-
sense-spout or half-a-dozen ?
* * * *
To the Testaments great and small there comes a
codicil, and a very good codicil it is; there are
‘Poesies Diverses’; and there are a number of
‘Poesies Attributes’ to Villon—with more or less
justice or injustice. So Mme. Dreyfus is decidedly
obscure, at the least.
* * * *
A complete translation of Villon into English
is done by .John Payne, but is not (nor is the
original) in Sydney Public Library, though a de-
ceiving catalogue makes one think it is. The
translations on this page give some idea of Villon’s
merit, but none of the scope and plan of his work,
Villon’ s improprieties may be agreeably read of in
Stevenson’s ‘Men and Books.’ S. lingers lovingly
oyer his most improper ballad, and salves a here-
ditary Calvinistic qualm by dubbing him ‘the
sorriest figure on the rolls of fame,’
TO DEATH, OF HIS LADY.

Who hadst my lady away from me,

[OUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
> C HITTS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne's Bronchitis Cure.
Tho.se who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the obese
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from ‘coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent eough, expi ctorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
69 other leading residents.

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
Private, Nervous and Skin Diseases.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, Ac.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILITY,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
D Ft. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY EIRE

All cases are treated strictly confidentially.
In publishing the following remarkable state-
ments, we do so at the special wish of the writers
only ; otherwise secrecy is considered inviolable,
letters and particulars of cases being destroyed
at the termination of same.
Mr. J. H. WEHR, FARMER,
WASLEYS, S.A. writes “ I can-
not refrain from adding my testi-
monial to your numerous list. In
justice to science, humanity, and
yourselves I must say that your
treatment of sorrowful afflictions is
past all belief. For seventeen years
I have been a sufferer, and four
months ago I went from bad to
worse ; in fact lost all hope of ever
being well again. When I visited
you I was at once placed under a
course of treatment entirely new to
myself, and from the first I was able to attend to my
occupation as farmer. lam happy to state that lam now
well and better than I have been for years, but shall
follow your advice and take the remedies for some time to
do away with all risk. I shall always remain indebted te
you for my wonderful cure.”
ANTHONY BARRY, Castle Inn,
Hindley-street, Adelaide, writes :—•
“ I will be glad if you will publish
the following for the benefit of suf-
ferers. For the last five years I
have been in the West, having
worked from Lake Darley to the
Horse Shoe Bend in Murchison.
Nearly the whole of the time I have
been a sufferer from Debility,
and loss of energy, always moping
alone, afraid to join in any
conversation, noises in the ears, and other symp-
toms too numerous to mention ; in fact, was a nuisance
to myself and mates. Tried many advertised remedies
without obtaining any relief. On my way to New Guinea,
and hearing of so many from the West on their way to
other colonies breaking their journey at Adelaide to
obtain your treatment, I decided to do the same. lam
glad to say I now feel fit to continue my journey without
fear, and am sure I have only to take your remedies a
little longer to obtain a thorough cure. lam well known
in all parts of the West, and write this that my mates and
others may know where they can obtain a certain cure.”
Mr. M. J. DENAHY, Beryl
Street, Broken Hill, writes: —
“ Your remedies have acted
like magic in my case, having
been a sufferer for months
from weakness, and through
weakness I was so ill that I
had to give Up work, and I
say truthfully I never thought
I should ever regain my
strength, as I took so much
medicine before seeing you
and without feeling the
slightest bit better, when
fortunately I met a patient of
yours, Mr. J. Kent, who
advised me to lose no time,
and, using his own words, he
said : ‘ The only chance you
have is to go to Brunswick, Hamilton & Co., who will
very soon put you right,’ and I am thankful I took his
advice, for since I took your remedies I am as well and as
strong as ever I was in my life. I cannot thank you suffi-
cient for what you have done for me.’’
REMARKABLE CURE OF DEBILITY.
Mr. J. W. AITCHISON, 22 North-st., Adelaide, writes :
Gentlemen,—l cannot refrain from adding my testi-
mony to your extraordinary and most marvellous treat-
ment of one of the worst cases of Debility such as mine
was. Since being under your care I can safely say that I
am a strong man once more, and the distressing symptoms
from what I was suffering from have all disappeared in a
most miraculous manner. I had previously been under
the care of five different practitioners for the past four
years ; purchased three different galvanic or electric belts,
without deriving any benefit whatsoever. I had given up
all hope of ever being myself again, when I was recom-
mended to see you. In two weeks’ time I began to feel
improvement, and your remedies did more for me than
the whole four years’ treatment with others. I feel as if
I can never thank you enough, and, as I should like other
sufferers to know what you have done for me, make what-
ever use you like of this.”
JOSEPH MARTIN, Cen-
tral Mine, Broken Hill,
writes :—“ Accept this tes-
timonial in recognition for
the valuable services you
have rendered me by per-
forming a wonderful cure of
my case, which has been on
me for over five years, and
now that I am well and tell
you that I spent over £2OO
before consulting you, and
deriving not a farthing’s
worth of benefit from emin-
ent men makes my case one
that other sufferers should
hear about, so that they can
be treated and cured as I am,
and also made strong,
r,
healthy, and happy, which I never thought could be done
until I was a short time under your care. I could con-
tinue for months writing of the misery and anxiety which
I have suffered, and it makes this testimonial one of great
value not only to you, but also to those who may be
sufferers like I ‘was, and those that read this and will take
my advice and place their case in your hands will not only
thank you, but also me for making it known to them.

All Sorts SCiitcd
Perhaps you are one who only thinks of the
UTILITIES, one who eschews everything but
what is strictly necessary. You’ve a penchant
for FLANNELS, but have a DERRY on SILKS,
and when there’s HOMESPUN about you can’t
see the occasion for bothering about PLUSH and
VELVET. Simple and good is your motto ;
you’re almost a Quaker, though not quite, and
you’d rather see your money in the bank than on
your back, and dividends are better, say you, than
and Laces. Well, have your own way.
We provide for all sorts and sizes.
Or perhaps you are of another class. A world-
ling, if you will, floating down the stream of life,
with “youth at the prow and pleasure at the
helm,” you want to dress well and to look well.
The eyes of the fair are upon you, and you would
win their smiles. You want Clothes and Hats
and Boots, Gloves you must have, and a thousand
other things you crave for. Rings, Lockets,
Gems, exquisite Neckties, Shirts galore, good
CIGARS, and TOBACCO of the best. You’d
like them all, wouldn’t you ? You can have them,
sir, at our store for what is, when compared to
what other stores are asking, a mere song.

[ FOR THE BULLETIN.
The boy went out from the ranges grim,
And the breath of the mountains went with him.
With a song in his heart and a smile on his face,
And a light in his eyes for a foremost place.
And the good green earth, and the salt sea spray,
And the soft blue skies, they were his that day.
And, like Eden, ringed with a golden fire—
Afar rose the Land of His Heart’s Desire.
The boy went down to the city’s strife,
And his face was lost in the surge of life.
But a Power that he did not understand
Had nerved his brain and his fighting hand.
And he strove and failed, and he rose and won—
And he failed again ere the fight was done.
But he battled on when the days were dire
To win to the Land of His Heart’s Desire.
And there, in the heart of the stress and din,
’Mid want and labor and wealth and sin,
The strong man struggled with shining eyes,
And forced a passage, and grasped the prize.
And he cried to the Power who had lent the fire :
“ Lo ! Fame is the Land of My Heart’s Desire !
“ Give the cup to me with a beaded brim.”
And the Power that he knew not gave it him.
But the air is keen on the Cliffs of Fame,
And the shafts that fly have a deadly aim !
With a foothold scarce, and a sleepless dread
For the gulfs below and the heights o’erhead,
He cried to the Power who had steeled his hand :
“ I am outcast yet from my Fairyland !
For Fame is a land where no strength may tire,
But Love is the Land of My Heart’s Desire ! ”
Then there came to the man all his dream of
Love,
With the brow of snow and the eyes of a dove,
With the glint of the sun on her wavy hair,
And her soul as pure as her face was fair.
Like a living lily to him she came,
Till his eyes were wet and his soul was flame,
And she called to him, with an outstretched hand,
And they entered into the Promised Land.
But there came a day when he asked his soul,
“ Is this the land, and is this the goal ? ”
In his heart there lay what his lips denied—
The pang of a hunger unsatisfied.
“For Fame,” he said, “ and for Love I wrought :
They are not the things that I should have sought.
’Tis to boundless power that my dreams aspire—
And Wealth is the Land of my Heart’s desire ! ”
Then the Power that he did not understand
Gave him ships and houses and gold and land,
And the man’s power grew with each passing
year;
But his thoughts were vexed with a sleepless fear,
And his hair grew gray with the iron strain
Of the dread of loss and the lust of gain,
And he bowed his head on his hands and said :
“ All things are mine, but my heart is dead ! ”
And he thought of the boy from the ranges grim
With the breath of the mountains over him,
With a song in his heart and a.smile on his face,
And a light in his eyes for a toremost -place.
And the good, green earth and the salt sea spray,
And the soft blue skies that were his that day,
When, like Eden, ringed with a golden tire,
Afar rose the Land of his Heart’s Desire.
Then clear on his startled ear there fell
A voice like the sound of a silver bell: —
“ To each is the work that he best can do,
But you turned from the work when' it called to
you.
And you sought instead for the vulgar praise,
For the lips of love and for prosperous days.
And with all that the world can give you here,
You have lost the thing that you hold most dear.
For who hears the word that the Gods inspire—
In his work finds the Land of His Heart’s Desire.”
GEO. ESSEX EVANS.
A certain trustee of a Melb. cemetery pro-
posed, the other night, that the sleeping-ground be
lit up with fairy lights and open to the sorrowing
public on Jubilee night. He thought the effect
would be just splendid, and talked about the soft
light, &c., on the white advertisements, and
wound up a long harangue by sajfifrg—“ think
how happy our relations and friends would be if
they could get up and see it !” This genius only
got beaten by 14 votes for Parliament last year.
Mr. Arthur Griffith, M.L. A., desires t°
inform intending patentees ‘that on account of his
satisfactory arrangements with leading patent
agents in all the Australasian provinces, the prin-
cipal countries of Europe, America, and South
Africa, he is in a position to take out patents,
register trade-marks, companies and copyrights,
at rates very much below those hitherto charged by
expert patent agents, and which will be within the
reach of everyone. For the sum of £2O, exclusive
of cost of drawings, he will obtain a Certificate of
Provisional Protection (in the first instance) for
any invention in the seven Australian provinces
and Great Britain and full patents in any other
countries in the world at proportionately reason-
able rates. Mr. Griffith’s office is 41 Castlereagh-
-street, City, next Hotel Australia.*
On one of the Darling harbor (Sydney)
wharves the other day the writer noticed an alto-
gether surprising amount of exertion on the part
of a number of men engaged in unloading a vessel.
Enquiry elicited this:— t( See that first fellow)
he’s first every time ; he’s what is called a pacer ;
he gets Is. 3d. an hour, and the others Is. ; if they
fail to make as many journeys (keeping at his
heels) as he does, well—they quit at once, and
make room for fresh triers. It’s the only way to
*et work out of them.”
Insect plagues in the North have evoked
umsiderable ingenuity. At Cairns the multitu-
linous grasshopper was thus exterminated: A
hece of calico 15ft. by 3ft. was nailed to a wooden
frame and saturated with kerosene. Two boys
then held the frame in a slanting position and
valked slowly over the hopper country. The
usects, of course, rose, and, on coming in contact
with the kerosene, died instantly. Acres thus
C 1 ired at a cost of a few shillings.

Direct Taxation.
When the land and income tax policy was
introduced in New South Wales, it was
generally hailed as a great democratic
triumph. It certainly was a democratic
triumph of a sort, but that is about all that
can be said for it. So far as could be con-
trived, all semblance of democratic principle
was left out of the new order of things,
and it is as nearly as possible a money-
grinding, revenue-making device, pure and
simple. There is no special Liberalism about
direct taxation, simply because it is direct,
neither is there any special Toryism or re-
trogressive tendency about indirect taxation
simply because it is indirect. It is quite
possible for the latter to be so arranged as to
be mainly a tax on wealth and to be based
on the most democratic principles, and for
the former to be mainly a tax on poverty and
to be as Tory as the most aggressive Fat
Man could desire. The two words, "direct
taxation,” imply no more in themselves than
any other two words—say "whale oil” or
" galvanised iron.” The result of too much
trusting to mere terms of speech is that, of
the five provinces which have adopted direct
taxation, New South Wales has got it in the
most utterly illiberal and stupid and hope-
lessly Tory form, and its principal effect has
been to shift a burden off one very wealthy
and useless class, the Sydney importers, and
shift it on to a larger and, in some degree, a
less affluent section of the community.
* * ♦ 9
There are five provinces—New South
Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania,
and Maoriland —in which income and land
taxes are collected. Of all these five New
South Wales is the only one where, apart
from the exemption of £2OO, large and small
incomes are taxed alike, and where the pre-
carious income that is derived from personal
exertion, and liable to stop short at any
moment when the brain or hand of the
worker gives out, is charged at the same rate
as the permanent income derived from in-
vestments, which goes on just the same
whether the owner lives or dies. Also New
South Wales, unlike Maoriland and South
Australia, makes no difference, apart from
the exemption, between the large landowner
and the small one, and it comes down on the
stupendous land-grabber and the struggling
farmer, on the citizen and the absentee syn-
dicate, in almost exactly the same propor-
tions. As a mere revenue-raising scheme,
to enable Premier Reid to dispense with
Customs duties and placate his friends, the
importers and aggregate Calico Jimmyism of
Sydney, this is good enough. As a means of
“shifting the burden on to the rich ” it is
seriously deficient.
In Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania,
and Maoriland the income-tax is built on
strictly democratic lines. Victoria starts
with an exemption of £2OO a year. After
that the first £lOOO of each income derived
from personal exertion is taxed at the
rate of 4d. in the £ ; the second £lOOO
is taxed 6d., and anything beyond that Bd.
in the £. But the rates levied on incomes
derived from property are exactly double
these figures ; the man who has a revenue of
£6200 a year from investments pays at the
rate of Bd. in the £ on £lOOO ; Is. in the £
on £lOOO, and Is. 4d. in the £ on £4OOO.
South Australia allows an exemption of
£l2O, but only on incomes not exceeding
£3OO. Its rates are in the £ up to £BOO,
and 6d. in the £ beyond that for incomes
derived from personal exertion, and double
these rates on incomes derived from pro-
perty. Tasmania has practically the same
system as regards exemptions as South Aus-
tralia, and it also charges extra rates upon
incomes derived from property. Maoriland
grants an exemption of £3OO to the resident
but no exemption at all to the absentee ; and
whereas the tax upon a private citizen’s in-
come of £lOOO is only 6d. in the £, on any-
thing over that the rate rises to Is. Com-
panies and syndicates, however, pay Is. in
the £ all through, consequently a resident
with an income of £lOOO a year pays £ 17 10s.,
and a foreign co. with the same income pays
£5O. New South Wales alone makes no dis-
tinctions between the very rich man and the
man of moderate means. It charges the
same rate to the man who has no accumula-
tions, but makes his £6OO a year by hard
toil, and whose whole working capital
vanishes when a brick falls from an un-
finished building on his head, and to the
non-producer whose t'6oo a year represents
£20,000 invested in State securities. Apart
from the exemption, it places the man with
£lOOO a year and the man with £lO,OOO on
exactly the same level, and it treats the
absentee just as well as the man who spends
his income in the country from which it is
derived. As a democratic policy this kind
of income-tax is a very abject failure.
* * * *
In South Australia and Maoriland the
land-tax is graduated according to the value
of each estate, and in both these provinces
the absentee pays a much heavier tax than
the resident proprietor. In Maoriland the
small landholder is exempt up to £5OO, while
the large holder has no exemption whatever.
Also, the rates vary from Id. in the £ on
small estates, up to 3d. in the £ on the very
largest, and on top of even this the absentee
pays 20 per cent, extra taxation. Large
special exemptions are allowed where a
small estate is the sole means of support
of a proprietor who is incapacitated by old
age or sickness. New South Wales allows
an exemption up to £240. Beyond that it
charges the absentee and the resident pro-
prietor, the man with £lOOO worth of land
and the man with £lOO,OOO worth, on
exactly the same basis, and its land-ta* is,
therefore, about as hopelessly undemocratic
a thing as could have been invented. It
does nothing to discourage the obnoxious
race of absentee landlords who merely
derive their income from New* South Wales
and spend the proceeds in London or else-
where ; therefore, absenteeism is worse in
New South Wales than in any other province.
When the absentee gets exactly the same
treatment as the man who spends his income
in the country, and who contributes to the
local liquor and tobacco and postal and railway
revenue, and who, by spending his revenue
locally, furnishes employment for the native
inhabitant, then New South Wales is as
good a place to be away from as any
other place. The cornstalk system doesn’t
even profess to discourage the accumula-
tion of huge estates, and, as a natural
consequence, 50 per cent, of tiie privately-
owned land in New South Wales is held in
areas of over 10,000 acres, the average of the
679 landowners who own half the private
land of the province among them being
30,819 acres apiece. Another 4482 people
own an average of 2640 acres apiece
The very large estates are steadily increasing
in number, and are swallowing up the coun-
try three times as fast as the small ones, and,
unless some special legislation is adopted to
meet the case, there seems to be no reason
why they should not continue doing so as
long as any land remains available.
* * * *
If the income-tax is to be a live measure
for shifting the burden of taxation upon the
rich, it needs to be so altered as to dis-
tinguish between the eminently precarious
income acquired by toil and the much less
precarious one derived from investments,
and to penalise the very wealthy, and
especially the wealthy absentee, more than
the people of only moderate means. And, if
the land-tax is to be anything better than a
scheme for grinding out revenue, it requires
to be put on an entirely new basis. In the
first place, the exemption should be increased
to at least £3OO ; nowadays, in many parts
of New South Wales, the agriculturist
with a good deal more than £240 worth
of land is often a miserably poor indi-
vidual, who has to eke out his precarious
existence by road-mending and shearing, and
tank-sinking at sweated wages, and other
casual foil. In this land of low prices, long
distances, free imports, bad roads, drought,
rabbits, and other curses, the idea of treat-
ing any man with more than £240 worth of
arable land—as the Government’s valuations
go —as a bloated person who requires special
taxation to keep him in subjection is
rather grotesque. Further, the tax should
steadily increase as the property grows
larger, so that the holding of estates of
very high value in the hands of a single
individual would become unprofitable ; the
holder of agricultural land who lets his pro-
perty should be more heavily taxed than
the one who cultivates it himself, in order to
discourage the formation of a new squirearchy
and the corresponding class which British
fiction describes as the "loyal tenantry ” ; and
the absentee—not the Australian of the other
provinces but the European variety—should
be taxed over and above all others, as an
individual whose extinction is a matter of
urgency.
• • » *
The present system of direct taxation in
New South Wales is no more democratic than
the semi-protective, semi-revenue-tariff sys-
tem which immediately proceeded it. Even
assuming that Protective duties do fall on
the consumer, which is eminently uncertain,
the former system taxed the rich and the
poor equally on some points, while on many
others it taxed the rich only ; very many of
the productive duties in the late tariff were
distinctly duties on luxuries with which
the poor are almost wholly unacquainted.
The present system exempts some of the
poor—those of the towns—and falls heavily
on a class in the country, many members of
which are now very indigent indeed. It was
passed by a curious alliance of conflicting
elements. The Labor-party supported it
because it had somehow come to be under-
stood that direct taxation must be a demo-
cratic idea, and that any kind of direct
taxation, however bad, must be better than
any kind of indirect taxation, however good.
The Sydney importing interests were, on the
whole, favorably inclined for three reasons :
The land-tax touches them very little ; as a
rule they are not land-holders on any scale
worth mentioning, so this impost was some-
body else’s concern. The income-tax is
merely a tax of 2J per cent, on their profits,
and as the protective duties were a much
heavier tax on their gross takings, the bar-
gain was an excellentonefor the Great Shoddy
Interest. Also, the absentee-tax touched
them not at all, for there was none ; and as a
very large proportion of importers are merely
representatives of foreign firms and com-
panies this was at least a negative virtue.
In other words, the importers had to choose
between a series of imposts which taxed
them specially and heavily as a wealthy and
objectionable class, and two series, one of
which hardly touched them at all, while
the other only fell on them in common
with members of every other branch of
industry. Naturally, they chose direct
taxation as far the less of two evils.
Through want of attention to detail, and a
weak belief in mere names and shibboleths,
it has come to pass that the reform which
was to shift the burden oft’ the poor and on
to the rich really shifted most of it off the
richest class in New South Wales, and re-
distributed it, partly among another class of
rich men, partly among the middle class,
partly among a class which is very poor
indeed. The Reid variety of democratic
taxation is mainly a sop to the wealthy class
which supports Reid ; otherwise, it is no-
thing in particular.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A “Genuine Antique"
1 he suggestion that ministers of religion might
with propriety, and even profit, countenance
such dramatic entertainments as “ The Sign of
the Cross ’' has brought blinking into the light
of day a tine specimen of Lhe true evangeli-
cal hog born 600 years behind his time.
The play cannot, in the first place, be of
any value as a moral stimulant, contends
this monumental prig, so long as its pri-
mary object is, not so much to teach or
preach anything, as to put coin in the pockets
of its producers. Which argument cuts beauti-
fully both ways, since - as the ecclesiastical ex-
pounder is no more disposed toexercilale gratis
than the dramatic one—the lessons of the pulpit
cannot, upon this showing, be of any greater
value than those of the stage. But, putting
aside this particular play, the singe as a whole
we are gravely assured, “ was never designed
to suggest or stimulate devotion to Gun
which, if it means anything, means that
whatever is not so specially designed is
an accursed thing, to be ‘ eschewed by
all true believers as rigorously as this
surpassing snufHer—to be consistent—would
himself have to eschew a picnic or a
picture-gallery ; a game of chess, a gallop in
the Centennial, a dip in the briny, or anything
v ' hatever that is iuiquitously conducive to the
mere relaxation and delectation of man. “ There
is always,” it is admitted with much groaning
“a certain percentage of church-goers who be
lieve in the theatre,” but these, it is com-'
placently inferred, will in all probability be
effectually damned “because they are out of
sympathy with evangelical religion.” “The
Christian who every day studies the Scriptures,
prays fervently, and undergoes careful self-
examination is one whom the theatre would
make sick ” ; but he is also one who would pro-
bably make the Founder of his alleged religion
sick ! The line of cleavage between the Chris-
tians who go to the theatre and those who don’t
is simply, it is not very obscurely implied, the
same old line between the sheep and the goats
—though theatre-goers as a whole, it is casu-
ally observed, would in any case be assuredly
booked for Tupliel, because the stage is con-
stantly ridiculing and caricaturing religion. And
in tins weary oh! misuse of the word “ re-
ligion ” lies the crux of the whole question.
Religion—as distinct from the sacerdotal super-
fluities, the mechanical pietism, the humbug
and hypocrisy and imposture generally, which
have crystallised round the term —is a thing
at which few' intelligent men care to sneer;
whereas, so long as the world is convinced in
its inmost heart that any one man is just as
sacred as any other, it will continue to scoti
at the priest, and pillory the pietists, and hold
up to wholesome contempt the holy humbug
of every sort and size.
The Vague Parson Person.
Pakson Edgak, almost the only witness before
the Vic. Old Age Pension Commission who had
a definite scheme to offer, suggests raising the
needful funds by a tax of 1 percent, per annum
on the value of lands used for racing purposes,
a tax of 10s. per head on every horse entered at
a race meeting, Id. on every person attending a
football or cricket match, os. on every dog
entered at a coursing match, Id. on every
theatre or concert-ticket issued, by a gun tax,
by the profits of a State pawnbroking business,
by a special tax on land, and by using for the
purposes of the pension fund a part of the pro-
ceeds of the taxes on liquor and tobacco. One
feature of the case is that some of Parson
Edgar’s taxes would yield so little as to barely
pay for collection, and the tax on people attend-
ing cricket and football matches would, in parti-
cular, be very hard to collect at all in many
cases. And, like everybody else, Edgar shirks
the problem ; about half of his idea is that ihe
State should give up a portion of its revenue—
the liquor and tobacco revenue—and that the
Treasurer should be left to find new sources of
income to fill the gap. A man whose idea is
simply that some one else should find the need-
ful ideas doesn’t throw much light on any sub-
ject. The question at issue is this : A really
efficient Old Age Pension scheme would cost,
in Victoria or N.S.W., somewhere between
.£500,000 and £1,000,000 a year, so far as can
be guessed at present, and this amount must
all be raised by new devices. The Treasury
can’t make ends meet even now, and the
proposal that it should provide part of
the pension-fund out of its present resources
is blank insanity ; instead of being in a
pos.tion to give up part of its drink
and tobacco revenue it wants a great deal
more drink and tobacco and other revenue for
its own purposes. The tote might be made to
supply a part of the needful funds. A good
deal more might be raised by the state being
its own “ Tattersall ” ; and taxes on foreign
insurance-offices, absentees, bookmakers, and
patent-medicines might possibly make up the
rest of the sum needful. Rut the pious element
of the community, while admitting the desira-
bility of a pension system, repudiates with
horror the idea of raising the necessary funds
by totes and lotteries, and it never by any
chance suggests a means of raising the money
without them. Its one great idea is to shunt
three-fourths of the responsibility on the state
Treasurer, which isn’t solving the difficulty,
but merely passing it on to a person who is
already about the most tired individual in the
country.
The Bushy Park Scandal.
1 hat clumsy, Highland person, Minister
M‘Kknzie —the man who aimed the pickle-
bottle at Fish —is fast making trouble for the
M.L. Government. The story of the present
stench is briefly as follow's : The Bushy Park
estate was one of the assets of the Bank of New
Zealand. It was transferred, at one of the
many reconstructions, to the B.N.Z. Assets
Co. A board—of which Premier i Seddon is a
member—was appointed to release these assets,
and it realised on Bushy Park by selling it to
the sons of Seddon’s colleague, the M'Kenzie
aforesaid. The price at which it was sold is
unknown, so are the terms of payment, and
Minister M'Kenzie, when interrogated on the
subject, merely w’aves two large hairy fists in
the air and refuses any definite information.
At one public meeting lie went so far as to
oder to show the title deeds to any person who
wanted to see them, but when Hutchinson,
M.P., promptly accepted the offer, the large
M'Kenzie crawled out and the deeds were not
forthcoming. Rumor has it that the M'Kenzie
family got the property for £5OOO less than
another purchaser was willing to pay ; also,
that whereas the other purchaser offered cash
the M'Kenzies got Bushy Park on credit—that
they didn’t even pay a deposit. Another theory
is that they paid for the stock and improve-
ments, and the land was generously thrown in.
Anyhow, there is a fine, large stench in pro-
gress, and opinions are divided as to whether
M'Kenzie is a particularly clumsy public ass,
who manages to arouse suspicion against him-
self by sheer clumsiness and obstinacy, or
whether lie is helping to conceal a very fishy
transaction which is next-door to a fraud. Also
the fat man is rising all over the seven provinces
to say that this is a conclusive evidence of the
evils of a State Bank—which is putting the
matter exactly upside-down. The M'Kenzie
family stench is solid evidence of the advan-
tages of State banking. The same kind of
tiling, as is alleged truly or untruly in the Bushy
1 ark case, happens in the great majority of pri-
' ate banks, but when the managers and directors
help themselves to the funds of a private bank
the fact—as is shown by the history of almost
every private bank which has gone under in
Australia—never conies to light until it is too
late. It only transpires after the burst —never
earlier. But in the case of the State institution
the M'Kenzie family’s little transaction was
hardly put on paper and signed and sealed and
blotted, before half the country rose to ask


father M'Kkszik for an explanation; and
unless that hairy Caledonian offers a better
one than he has presented up to date the
Government to which he belongs will get a
shock from which it won’t readily recover. The
charge levelled against him—mostly by the
Opposition papers—is one of plain, vulgar
fraud, and until an adequate explanation is
forthcoming people will keep on calling it a
vulgar fraud indefinitely. The Ministerial
organs mostly keep silence, though one of them
advances the suggestion that MKenzie has a
perfectly good explanation to offer but is too
bitterly obstinate to offer it. Altogether it is
a delicate situation, and the Minister—vvho is
mainly a man of brawn and stoush —hasn't the
diplomacy that the occasion requires.
The Priestly Taboo.
The “touchiness” of Roman Catholicism re-
veals itself absurdly in connection with a Mel-
bourne amateur performance of a feeble comic
opera— “ Lelamine,” to wit. The local (R.C.)
Advocate has “no hesitation in saying that
• Lelamine’ is a vile, demoralising production,
a slander on the Catholic priesthood, and an
insult to Catholics generally. ... We could
wish that there were no Catholics engaged in
‘ Lelamine,’ but that shame we are spared.”
To the average Protestant, who was unable to
discover the drift of the poor little opera afore-
said, these ravings appear pitiable. They are
easily explained, however. Among the more
or less inaudible mummers in “ Lelamine ” was
one who played a priest, and the priest was
dimly understood to be an uncelibate soit of
person, addicted to visiting a convent by a
private subway, or something to that effect.
In short, “Lelamine” was an “insult to
Catholics” because it put forward, iu a farci-
cally exaggerated form, the suggestion that
a Catholic priest may be quite as giddy
as a Protestant parson who “carries on
with the sanctimonious girl adherents of his
little church or chapel. And because one
grotesque priest was here supposed to do
exactly as hundreds of parsons have been con-
victed of doing, atone timeor other, official Roman
Catholicism gets its holy hair off. The “ Lela-
mine” notice for a Melb. weekly paper was
written by an Irish-blooded representative of
the ould faith, and the protest of this indig-
nant critic sent the Catholic bawl rolling.
Archbishop Carr, upon being appealed to,
thought it “ regrettable that the plot of any
public opera should be based on incidents
which had no foundation in fact , and which
appeared to rely for their success on the anti-
cipated prejudices of certain of the audience
rather than on the merits of a plot.”
The celibate Archbishop took an even
more foolish view of a trivial, inci-
dent than his reverent “ son,” the
Milesian pressman, had taken in the first in-
stance. His Grace hinted that the giddy priest
on the stage was a dirthy heretical device for
bringing an immaculate priesthood into ignor-
ant contempt. Such utterances put the all-
round unbeliever out of patience. An outsider,
honestly convinced that all religious denomina-
tions claim too much holiness for their spiritual
professors, naturally objects to being asked to
swallow the R.C. claims without a grain
or two of salt. Numerous stage satires on
Protestant parson cant are founded on fact,
and laughed at by Protestants accordingly. For
instance, Dr. Cantwell and Mawworm in
“The Hypocrite.” But the R.C. priest and
the R.C. boarding-school for girls, or convent
—they must be held absolutely sacred. Why
in the name of scandalous revelations, ancient
and modern !—why is the priestly denial of
human nature to escape ridicule ?
His Brother's Keeper.
Why is it that the professional philanthropist,
when he isn’t a self-advertising humbug, is so
often au unspeakable ass ? It’s only too likely
that, when the old-age pension question comes
under formal investigation in N.S.W., the local
“ charity organisers ” will be to the fore with
much such “ expert evidence ” as that which
set forth to the Victorian Royal Commission
that about 70 per cent, of the existing poverty
is due to strong drink, and that the old-
age pension system, by relieving men of
anxiety about the fag-end of existence, would
produce yet more tippling, and by consequence,
more pauperism. Which balderdash serves
only to show, in the first place, that no man
should be accepted as an “ expert” in indigence
who hasn’t himself undergone a severe attack
of empty pocket; and, in the second, the true
inwardness of alcoholism remains still a sealed
book to everybody who hasn’t been more or less
“through the mill” in person. The well-fed
dilettante humanitarian who hankers so hugely
(upon paper) after the rehabilitation of his
broken-down brother is too much accustomed
to take his opinions cut-and-dried to get a
glimmer of the facts that the drink-
habit is just as often the effect of misery
as the cause of it, and that to assure a
man’s future is often the very best way to
sti'aighten-up his present. The most im-
practicable drunkard is the despair-drunkard ;
tlie most utterly reckless spendthrift is, para-
doxically, he who has little to spend and less to
hope for. And, in any case, if it is true that
prospective provision conduces to present im-
providence, the Great Gospel of Thrift is but
sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal, and the
“ expert witness,” himself—for the most part a
wearisome apostle of that directly anti-Chris-
tian cult—should proceed forthwith to scatter
to the winds his treasure upon earth, lest
by the knowledge that he has treasure, and
that his future is thereby assured, he too
should be seduced into the broad road that
leadeth unto booze and begging and general
burst-up. Ou which melancholy highway,
before he should have travelled far, he’d have
discovered that he hadn’t even begun to realise
the intricacy of the problem about which lie
and his kind are always so complacently ready
with the rashest of opinions.

Hot Indebted!
Fd. Bulletin,— The approach of the “ diamond
jubilee” junketings has tilled the air with such
mouthings about “loyalty,” “fealty, alle-
giance,” ami so forth, that a plain word upon
the subject seems badly wanted. To be loyal,
broadly speaking, is to think and act towards
another as that other has a right—real or
imaginary—to expect ; and upon the validity or
otherwise of this right turns simply and
directly I he distinction between the loyalty a
man owes and the loyalty he doesn’t owe. To
one’s friend there is a personally-assumed duty
to be true, as there is a congenital obligation to
be true to one’s family, and to that larger family
which is the state. But loyalty to the state—
to the best interests of the community—so
far from involving “ attachment ” to any
“ throne and person,” is actually incompatible
therewith ; and, exactly in proportion as a man
loses sight of the national idea in the personal,
he is apt to mistake the most contemptible of
feelings for the noblest, and to fancy himself
an ardent patriot when he is no more than an
enthusiastic Hunkey. There have, indeed, been
individuals—imperial, royal, and what-not—
w horn the most ardent democrat could admire
without sacrificing the tenth part of a prin-
ciple. The late Emperor of Germany, for in-
stance—to stick to our own times—was such a
Man at all points that his paternity of the
regnant mountebank offers a curious study in
heredity ; and even sanctimonious old swash-
buckler William was not altogether devoid, in
his pipeclay dignity, of that heroic interest
which cannot by the wildest stretch of imagina-
tion be extended to the dismally stolid and
commonplace G uelphs. And there is, of course,
no necessity to revile, on account of positions
they do not adorn, persons who happen to have
been thereunto fated :
Spurn not the “ nobly born,”
Nor treat with virtuous scorn
The “well-connected.”
They boast an equal claim
With him of humble name
To be respected 1
Vi< TORIA-by-the-Grace is as much entitled to
t he ordinary courtesies of life as any other re-
spectable old lady, and it is sheer futility to
blackguard Ti mmy Wales qua Wales and not
qua Ti mmy. People who prance round after
this fashion themselves generally possess a
latent vein of snobbishness. The really
self respecting man will accommodate him-
self, within certain limits, to things as
they are, and won’t imagine for a moment
that by blatant asininity they can be any the
sourer made what he wants them to be. But
it is precisely this common-sense part of him
which renders him, on the other hand, totally
unable to comprehend how any presumably
reasoning being can have the faintest glimmer
of fervor concerning perhaps the most utterly
uninteresting personality that ever sat upon a
throne. And, foolish as it is to go into public
hysterics over the fact that Victoria R.I. has
had her august hand rather longer in the
national cash-box than any of her predecessors,
it is foolisher still to raise the cheap howl of
“ disloyally ! ” against any man simply because
he can find nothing to go off his bead about in
a stout little old lady with an uncertain temper
and an uncommonly hard grip of the bawbees.

The rent of Melbourne’s most flourishing pub.
(You no and Jackson’s) was lately raised to the
extent of £I(JOU per annum by its absentee
owners. The local agents for the property
reckoned that an extra £5OO per annum on the
new lease would be a fair thing, but the Hing-
lish ladies (sisters) who control the situation
stood out for four figures, and got them. Cir-
cumstances over which the original purchaser
of “ Young and Jackson’s corner” exercised
no control whatever have made the situation
valuable for any business purpose, and especially
valuable for the licensed sale of liquor. A
license in this ease practically represents a large
annual Government grant to the leaseholders,
of which grant a large percentage leaves Vic-
toria every half-year in the form of unearned
increment for an English family that contributes
nothing towards the Vic. Government s support.
The political aspect of the Young and Jackson
case is worth considering. Socialism might
justly demand that hotel licenses shall be re-
stricted to premises whose owners reside
within the province. Every trader works
for the benefit of his landlord—sometimes
himself, another fellow generally—and a pros-
perous business means an increasing rent \ alue,
hut a licensed victualler differs from other
traders in that he works for a landlord who
enjoys a measure of State protection. In
Sweden the State is the only licensed vic-
tualler, and every pub. belongs to the Govern-
ment. In Australia this desirable consumma-
tion is hoped for by all good democrats and
friends of the public stomach. Meanwhile,
private landlords reap the first fruits of the
liquor-trade monopoly, therefore an Act com-
pelling the personal attendance of all landlords,
and part-landlords, at the court on licensing
dav, would seem not unreasonable. It would
at'least prevent the English ladies aforesaid
from being perpetual absentees. In fact, such
an Act would make the lot of an absentee pub-
owner too irksomely travelsome for endurance,
and the smaller the lot of absentees that this
country has to endure the better for our
Federal constitution—when it arrives.
Parson Isitt, the flaming Maorilaud teetotaller,
is now on the loose in Australia, and holding
forth in his wonted combustible language about
the Accursed Derrink, and the need for its
total abolition. The Bulletin doesn’t really care
much whether the Derrink is abolished or not ;
all the thirst it has got can he quenched 111
other ways. But it respectfully asks brotliei
Isitt for the several-dozenth time, how he is
going to make up the £2,500,000 revenue which
will be sacrificed when his policy is adopted
throughout Australasia ? It has asked this
question of many oilier shrieksome teetotallers,
and not one has supplied an answer. Lhe
revenue can’t be dispensed w ith. It is no good
saying that the Lord will provide ; it is neces-
sary to indicate how He will provide so that
the Treasurers will know where they are. It
is no good saying that the increased affluence
of the people will make it easy to fill the gap ;
what the public wants to know is how' a sum-
cient amount of that increased affluence can be
extracted from the people—whether by an in-
come-tax of ss. in the £, or otherwise—to nil
the gap. It doesn’t want to be shunted off by
vague x’emarks about the alleged savings
that will be effected in police and gaol ex-
penditure ; if all the gaol and police
expenditure could be saved by the aboli-
tion of drink it wouldn’t make up, or
nearly make up, for the loss of revenue. If
the typical teetotal lecturer would saw the air
less and come down to business-like particulars
a little more, it would do the cause a great deal
of good. For instance, one province (S. A.) has
a teetotal Treasurer, and in all probability he
would be glad to come down on the Derrink
with all his might if the wild-eyed Isitt would
only show how it can be done without reducing
the province to immediate insolvency. If Isitt
proposes simply that liquor should be extin-
guished, and that as a consequence the interest
on the public debt be unpaid and the country
go in for repudiation straight-out, why doesn t
he say so, and take the responsibility like a
man ?
Dear Bulletin,— Mr. Ashton remarks :
Or, take a Colored Races Restriction Bill. Victoria and
N.S.W. might vote solidly in favor of stringent restric-
tion, and Tasmania, S.A., and W.A. against. In the
Lower House voting would be 82 to 25 in favor of the
restriction ; in the Upper House, 24 to 16 against. And
the policy of Australia with regard to colored races would
be determined by an insignificant fraction of the people,
&c., &c.
Singularly enough, this is precisely what did
occur in the United States under the system of
equal state representation in the Senate. The
Senate, chosen on this vicious principle, was
directly responsible for the Civil War. The
House of Representatives showed itself reason-
ably democratic, and did its utmost to stem the
approaching calamity. During the 29th Con-
gress the Lower House passed an Act admitting
the territory acquired from Mexico to the Union
on condition that slavery should exist
therein. This Act being passed on to the Senate,
the latter did not even vote on it, and it fell
through. During the 30th Congress a Bill pro-
viding territorial government for California
and prohibiting slavery therein was also
passed bv the House of Representatives.
The Bill having been sent to the Senate, that
body refused even to consider it, and it re-
mained dead on the table. On the introduction
of the famous Oregon Bill prohibiting slavery
in that territory the champions of slavery in
the House of Representatives agreed to support
the Bill if a clause were added having for its
object the obtainment from the House of a
recognition of the right of slavery to extend it-
self in -all territory below 36’30 north. The
House, however, rejected the amendment and
passed a no-slavery bill by a majority of 99.
The Senate, in the last day of its session,
simply laid this Bill on the table from which it
never rose. The Senate finally devoted all
Mexican conquered territory (except California)
to slavery by the following trick. In order to
make the measure pass the Lower House ten
million in a stock bearing 5 per cent, was to be
paid the State of Texas out of the U.S.
Treasury. As the Representatives held many
bonds they would hesitate to defeat the Bill.
It was, however, first defeated by a majority of
eight Representatives, and finally passed by 11
votes. Suddenly Texas bonds rose 85 per cent.,
and members became rich. Pretty reading,
isn’t it ? And so much for equal state-repre-
sentation. —P. Luftig.

As a sample of calm, unblushing perjury or
misrepresentation or Ananias or something of
the sort, the following, from a recent S.M.
Herai d leading article, has a lot to recom-
mend it: —
The volume of the “ Statistical Register,” just issued,
for 1895, shows that the manufacturing works in N.S.
Wales in that year employed 1132 more hands than in
1894, and 4965 more than in 1893 under the condition of
Protection. If this increase is not as large as might be
desired, it is to be noted, first, that it is widely different
from the wholesale closing up of works that was to take
place under Freetrade ; and, secondly, that it goes on
simultaneously with an immense expansion of country
production, by which much labor has been drawn off
from the town. These indications prepare us for trade
results strongly at variance with the dirges of dead indus-
tries and perishing trade which so largely enter into the
dreary political litany of the Protectionist party.
It sounds very beautiful, of course, to hear that
in 1895, under Freetrade, N.S.W. industries
employed 4965 more hands than they did in
1893 under Protection. It also sounds very
convincing, and the people who take their facts
from the Respectable paper at the foot of
Hunter-street, Sydney, are much impressed
thereby. Where the magnificent effrontery of
the matter comes in is that 1895 was not a
Freetrade year. It was as much a Protectionist
year as ’93, for the new tariff did not come into
operation until Ist Jan., 1896. 1 herefore, if
the increase of employment, as compared with
’93, was the result of the fiscal system in force,
as ti e Herald implies, it was one of the good
effects of Protection. The Herald, in its early
days, was dreary and veracious. Now it is
dreary and wretchedly ignorant, or else dreary
and utterly unscrupulous, and lost to that
decency which is supposed to keep politics from
degenerating into one part clumsy perjury and
one part Billingsgate.

The system of exacting subscriptions from the
local representative, which, in Australia,
threatens to defeat the political purpose of
“ payment of members,” is said to be driving
even' moderately fat men from the House of
Commons.
“Some time ago,” writes G. R. Sims, “ I was con-
versing with a member who had resigned on the plea ot
ill-health. He looked exceedingly well, and told me
frankly that the ill-health was merely an excuse. The
real reason of his retirement was that the demands made
upon him for money by various bodies in the borough he
represented had become so great that he was compelled
to give up the seat. . . . The system is a bad one and
should be at once reformed out of existence. It should
be made illegal for any candidate or sitting member to
contribute to any local club or charity, because so long as
he is allowed to iio so, so long will he be made to do so,
and the man with ‘ plenty money and no brains will
always in certain constituencies have a pull over the man
with ‘ plenty brains and no money.’ It is not at all a
pleasant reflection that a man’s fitness for Parliamentary
honors can only be decided by the amount he is willing to
subscribe to the local football and cricket-clubs and local
charities generally.”
If a mild Tory, of the Sims type, can take this
view of the situation in Great Britain (not
reckoning Ireland) where members get no
salary at all, and non-capitalists have not more
than half-a-dozen English borough seats within
the possibility of capture, it is time for Aus-
tralian democracy to cry out against the black-
mailing of the men it professes to champion.
Unhappily, the blackmail system in this country
is rooted in Young Australia’s sportive char-
acter. Whereas a wealthy British M.P. is only
expected to promote the cause of muscular
Christianity with coin, his needy cousin out
here is called upon to give time as well as
money in the character of president to this,
that and the other club and society. The
“ popular representative” of the future will he
a mere whisky-sw'elling dilettante in the arts of
Saturday afternoon pastimes, unless Parliament
hurries up with a Members’ Protection Act, on
the lines suggested by the Cockney playwright.
“ Rus Roberts” to The Bulletin in re Gent
One :
The decision of the Supreme Court, that names of solici-
tors called upon to “ answer affidavits ” shall not be
published till the matter comes on for hearing on the
application to make the rule absolute, has caused con-
siderable adverse comment which is based on a misappre-
hension of the real state of affairs. A solicitor is called
upon to explain his conduct to the Judges solely because
he is an officer of the Court, which exercises over him a
peculiar jurisdiction—a jurisdiction to which no other
class of persons is subject. It is his conduct as an officer
of the Court only that is brought into question on such
an occasion, and, that being so, why should not the same
course be followed in his case as would be followed in,
say, the Civil Service ? If the Public Service Board receives
a complaint about an officer, does it publish that fact,
together with the charges, to the world at large before
holding an inquiry, and before the officer has an oppor-
tunity to answer for himself ? Why, then, should the
Supreme Court act in that manner with regard to
its officers—the solicitors? The only charge that can
be made against a solicitor before the Supreme Court
is one regarding his conduct as a solicit/ r, and the court
then decides w hether he, as an officer, should be punished
or not. When this point is understood it will be seen that,
save as above, the Supreme Court has nothing to do with
the conduct of its solicitors. They may be guilty of all
the crimes in the New gate calendar, but unless it is done
by him as a solicitor the Court will not, and it is sub-
mitted has no right to, take any notice of it until a con-
viction has been obtained against him. Hence the
Supreme Court does not imprison a solicitor for embezzle-
ment- it strikes him off the roll as unfit to be one of its
officers ; but a jury must say whether he has committed a
criminal offence. Not so long ago a solicitor was
charged before a jury and acquitted, yet he was
struck off the rolls; not because he was guilty
of the crime charged, but for “ conduct not
becoming an officer,” &c. Hence there is no analogy
between the case of a solicitor called on to “ answer
affidavits ” which no other member of the community can
be called upon to do, and the case of a person charged in
the police-court- a misfortune to which every person is
liable—solicitors included. The striking of a solicitor off
the rolls does not operate as a bar to future criminal or
civil proceedings, as one would imagine from so much
that is written on the subject. In conclusion, a solicitor
is liable to every punishment to which an ordinary citizen
is, and, in addition to that, he is subject to an extra-
ordinary jurisdiction of a court which can, without his
having been found guilty of a criminal offence, and with-
out a trial before a jury, not only punish him by fine, but
can ruin him utterly by taking away his very livelihood.
New South Wales Assembly recently called on
Meteorologist Russell to explain why the
general rain he expected this year had, so far,
failed to turn up. But no one dreamt of de-
manding a report front the bosses of the
churches as to why the rain they prayed for
failed to turn up, and if anyone had suggested
such a thing he would have been outwardly
howled down as an indecent blasphemer and
inwardly laughed at as a fool. Yet Russell
merely said that, going by what is
known of the very much undeveloped science of
meteorology, a science hardly 100 years old yet,
it was most probable the drought would
break up this year, and the year isn’t
half gone yet. The clerics say that their
science is 6000 years old, that it is fully
developed, and that answer to prayer is a cer-
tainty—not a matter of speculation; and
almost an immediate certainty at that, dhere-
fore if Parliament had ever taken the humilia-
tion and prayer business seriously it would
have asked for a report from the cocksure men
of theology—not from the avowedly-uncertain
man of science. Also, if “the GoD-fearing
Ministry ” believed in the churches it wouldn’t
keep Russell at all. One indignant individual
has even suggested that the province should
hire a new meteorologist—the idea plainly
being that it might possibly get one who
could foresee rain better than the pre-
sent official. But no one has suggested
getting a new bishop who could pray for
rain better than Smith, because nobody has
any hope at all of getting a bishop any where
who can bring dow'n rain better than Smith,
and as Smith can’t bring down rain at all that
means giving up the whole case. Nobody ex-
pected anything off Smith’s church. , Nobody
in this instance got anything oft Smith s church.
And no politician dreams of asking Smith or
his church for an explanation or a report,
because Smith's church panned out just as
everybody knew it would. So did every other
church.
These remarks of the N. Y. correspondent to
S.M. Herald should be remembered when the
N.S.W. Protectionists again attain power:
Theoretically, ad valorem duties are alone equitable ;
but, even with sworn invoices, the foreign exporter and
his agent or consignee hire clerks to do the false swearing
for them, and under the Wilson Bill Uncle Sam has been
defrauded of scores of millions of dollars by very con-
servative, sound-monev, respectable men- men, too, who,
except in this life-and-death matter of getting their goods
into a paying market, and keeping their hundreds or
thousands of work-people busy and happy, are the very
soul of honor. No one blames them much ; indeed, most
men who have a kindly sense of duty to those to whom
they stand as captains of industry would venture fully as
much or more against the letter of the Ten Command-
ments. Yet Uncle Sam’s duty is, of course, to enforce
obedience to the law': and the easiest w r ay to do this is to
decree a duty of so much a pound or yard, not so much
per cent., upon dutiable imports.
Even “ theoretically ” there is a great objection
to act cal or eta duties, besides the fraud and per-
jury engendered. Foreign-made articles are
formidable to home manufactures because of
their low' price, and the cheaper they are the
greater the need of Protection. Under the ad
valorem system, the protection diminishes
with the price—ni’ore especially when the
foreigner reduces rates and sells at a loss so as
to smash up the protected industry. Thus an
ad valorem tariff is least effective w hen most
w'anted for protective, not revenue, purposes.
In America, Greeley and others favored w hat
is called a “ minimum ” —that is an ad valorem
tax down to a certain price— beyond which all
articles, irrespective of invoices and declara-
tions, are taxed at the same rate. It must also
be remembered that it is in the low-priced
articles that a protective tariff, especially a
young country, should produce the most benefit.

Farley’s second venture at Sydney Opera

Devilshoof is one of Farley’s best characters; as
the reckless, bass gipsy he is even more
convincing than in the gorgeous cavalier boots of
Don Jose. Miss May Glendinning’s Gipsy Queen
is an admirable piece of work, and Maud Lita fills
the part of Arline very satisfactorily. Percy
shannon makes a respectable Thaddeus ; there is
nothing brilliant or especially notable about
Thaddeus, but his eminent respectability hits the
audience like a brick; and a certain amount of
moderate tail brings up the rear of the pro-

and » • moun ting is good, and the “ Bohemian

The Brough Comedy Co. is further fare-
welling this week in the “Village Priest.” After
the tangled riot of the “ White Elephant,” be-
ginning nowhere and ending by a shattersome
collision against nothing, the fine old classic is
peace and rest and balm and beer, and everything
else that is commendable. It is a good many
years now since Titheradge first started to be a
dreamy celibate in the old French garden, and to
blow the caterpillars off the flowers, and he re-
mains just as good an advt. for the Holy Roman
church to this day. Titheradge, drowsing among
his blossoms, looks like a saint who had left his
halo hanging on the hat-rack when he came in,
and he suggests that the church he belongs to
must be a gentle, blameless institution that will
feed out of the hand. The old miracle, when a
leaf of the Bible turns over for no visible reason
and a ray of light comes down straight on the text
which settles the question, still goes well. Stage
miracles, as a rule, are none too convincing, but
this one is at least as good as the average. Brough
doesi his former tragic part of Jean Torquenie as
forcibly as of old ; and though he has done it so
often his excellence still comes on the public—
which never can quite realise that Brough is any-
thing but a very comic comedian—as a surprise.
The co. goes on farewelling in the “Village
Priest ” for the rest of this week, and on Saturday
it gets along a stage further with the painful duty
of tearing itself away by putting up “The
Solicitor.” The “ Village Priest” has a matinee
on June 4, and Titheradge takes a benefit on the
afternoon of J une 16. Also a ‘ ‘ Mrs. Tanqueray ”
matinee is promised for the 19th. This is the
first time the Broughs have gone in for the matinee
business.

The unlainenfced “White Elephant,” by
the way, got through with all due solemnity till
near the end of its unlovely career, and then it
grew hilarious quite unexpectedly, for reasons that
were not in the bill. Carey, as the stout, gouty
old gentleman, kept up his obesity by means of an
artificial stomach worn underneath his moral black
suit, and one night a rat lodged in this article.
The beast of prey presently broke out, and for a
dreadful hour it roamed over Carey underneath
his clothes, and casually chewed that comedian in
places. Uncle Tweed being a heavy and somno-
lent character, who remained in one place and told
stories of 40 cattle that were fed entirely on oil-
cake, there was no chance to squash the animal by
backing himself hard against a wall, and no one
could smack such a venerable-looking personage
hard on the rat and disguise the act by saying,
“ Hello, old cove ! ” Once Carey fixed the wild
animal under his arm, but when Brough found
him insensible on the floor and lifted him up it
escaped and rushed around him more madly than
ever. Then at last the curtain came down, and
two seconds later an undressed comedian was
wildly aiming boots at the uncouth monster and
objurgating.
** * *
Just at the appropriate moment, when
the first novelty might possibly be wearing off,
the expected religious controversy started to rage
around the “Sign of the Cross.” At a certain
matinee the astute management announced that
the clergy would be admitted free on presentation
of card at the door, and the church rolled up and
presented its card with a unanimity that was
beautiful to behold. The vestibule was darkened
with long-tailed black coats streaking in to the
great free show, and the black hats fled up the
stairs like locusts, and long rows of men with
shaved upper lips sat down to consider the beauty
of Berenis, the pagan. Then the controversy
broke out and has raged in moderation ever since.
Most of the clerics approved, but one, at all events,
came down on the purple-robed Caesar with an
awful thud and flattened him out. Still the
reverend gentlemen who left that great, unani-
mous card at the door were, on the whole, a great
deal less vigorous than The Bulletin expected,
which further convinces this paper that a lion
should put his head round the corner and roar in
the last scene, and gnash a fine set of shop teeth
at the Christians. That final touch of realism
would have certainly aroused some indignant cor-
respondent to use language that would have made
the drama run an extra week.

Sydney, after all, has not seen the last of
Mrs. Potter and the one transcendent Bellew.
They return shortly to do a one-week season, con-
sisting of two nights of “Romeo and Juliet,”
while four other plays not yet announced will be
put on for one night each. Then the amazing hat
of Mrs. Potter and the hyacinthine locks of Bellew
will vanish seaward in real earnest.
** * #
The Flying Jordans left at the end of last
week, and Sydney Royal is temporarily deserted.
On Saturday night, however, and two nights
afterwards, the Sydney Opera Co. will wrestle
with the “ Grand Duchess,” a piece which has had
a long rest and should be about due for revival.
The Palace has also gone under for a time. The
hard frost which settled down on the Gourlay co.
right from the beginning threatened at one time
to thaw —in fact, as reported in last week’s issue,
it did thaw considerably for a night or two. Then
it froze again as badly as ever, and John Gourlay
departed in search of more appreciative audi-
ences. A tendency to severe frosts seems peculiar
to the Palace, and so far the gods in particular
haven’t taken kindly to the new establishment.
Possibly its magnificence overawes them some-
what. The surroundings don’t lend themselves to
cheerful, off-hand profanity, and the remarks
which the god loves to make don’t go well with
the furniture. Likewise the gilding and the
artistic tints rise up in reproachful judgment
against him when he tries to say “ blanky,” and
seem to destroy the flavor of that useful execration.

The novelty this week at Sydney Tivoli is
the newly-imported Mr. Wootwell. The gentle-
man with the awkward name is a singer of a kind,
has a considerable capacity for comedy, and is a
wildly-reckless dancer, whose legs will probably
win a great deal of favor. The “ silver-coin ” co.
at the Royal Standard is doing the “ Ticket-of-
Leave Man ” with respectable success, and pur-
poses following it up with “ All for Gold.”
** * *
Three-act farcical comedy has been waning
in Melbourne ever since the golden sun went down
upon the boom-time and husbands grew virtuous
for lack of overdraft to invest in razzle-dazzle.
Sassiety used to roll up religiously to any sort of
farce that wasn’t quite proper, but it now holds
aloof from “A Night Out” at the Princess’s.
The plot is rich with matrimonial giddiness. It
contains three beds, four nightgowns, one rope-
ladder and a gimlet, and when an evil-thinking
waiter forms himself into a social purity league,
and bores the gimlet through a partition, the point
penetrates Paulton’s back. All the elements
—save one—of a first-class, shocking success are
crowded into “ A Night Out,” and yet the
dress-circle is very moderately attended. The
one thing wanting is a sense of reality ; but the
same thing was wanting in a dozen other rapid
farces that found great favor among the more
naked class of theatre-goers in the naughty days
of old. “ A Night Out ” has arrived too late.
Toorak is not taking any, nor does the multitude
rush the show. Nevertheless, and notwithstand-
ing the gloomsome evidence of an aged character
whose stutter convinces nobody, business might
be a lot worse.
* ♦ • •
Paulton seems to spread his style further
than he did on the opening night, with the result
that he catches a few more laughs from those
people who can’t see a joke until it is thrust
under their notice. Miss Alma Stanley, being a
very large lady in very loud dresses, is always an
obvious humorist, and her smile scores every time.
Also the fair young occupants of the four night-
gowns are a refreshing spectacle, and the lively
niece (Miss Stafford) who leads Hans Phillips
astray is calculated to disturb the moral principles
of any Christian boy on this planet. The two
waiters at the unspeakable restaurant are satis-
factory, but Cecil Ward’s colorless treatment of a
colorless part deserves a mild reproof. Last
week’s notice said that Cecil and the gentleman
with the stutter were deserving of a good word,
but the writer has changed his views on both
subjects.
** * *
Next Thursday (June 10th) the theatrical
and musical fraternity will contribute a matinee
show in aid of the Melb. Fever Hospital and the
Jubilee blow-out for the local poor. The Firm
gives the use of the Princess’s Theatre, and the in-
tention of the promoters is to beat their recent
Dramatic Benefit Fund record, if possible. Every
leading artist in Melbourne, likewise the “Lela-
mine ” amateurs, will appear at some point or
other of the entertainment. Mrs. Potter and
Bellew have promised to make a last farewell ap-
pearance on this great occasion only, and a souvenir
programme is to be specially illustrated in honor
of the Queen.
** * *
At Melb. Royal a change of bill ! One
speaks of a new bill at Bland Holt’s house with
the respect due to a circumstance that doesn’t
happen every week. “In Sight of St. Paul’s ”
has held the floor since Easter Monday, and The
Bulletin cannot lightly pass over the fact that
to-morrow (Friday) will be the last night of that
vast production. Such last nights are as
milestones on the road that leadeth to de-
struction; or semi-colons in the story of a
misspent life ; or we may say of them
deah friends but no matter: “A Life of
Pleasure ”is the forthcoming event. Bland Holt
has not yet stated why he held back this dazzling
melodrama until June. He keeps his loyal motive
up his sleeve in the meantime. He is saving it
for a grand jubilee revelation. “A Life of
Pleasure ” is an indirect allusion to the Longest
Reign, and a joyful reminder that our Gracious
has never permitted the cares of monarchy to act
injuriously upon her liver.
** * *
It appears that certain Melbourne amateurs
who didn’t get profusely buttered for their per-
formance in “ Lelamine ” (we are, 0 , so tired of
“ Lelamine ”) have found a satisfactory explana-
tion of the insult. “Several, if not all, of the
critics,” we are gravely informed, “ had orders to
praise ” three favored mortals, and restrain their
enthusiasm as regards the others. “ But why,”
asks a lady correspondent on behalf of the slighted
amateurs,’“ did The Bulletin follow in the same
strain ? ” It is not this journal’s custom to reveal
secrets of a damaging character, but, as a special
concession to the aggrieved parties, The Bulletin
will admit that it was bribed. A man with a
mask over his face came into the office and pur-
chased an unfair notice of “ Lelamine.” Our terms
were £5OO cash and the balance in cigars.
** * *
Mrs. T. R. Andrews, the daintiest of lec-
turesses, protests gently that a Bulletin para-
graph re her discourse on poet Shelley admits of
unpleasant misconstruction. To anyone ac-
quainted with her “ womanly woman ” sentiments
the chaffing tone of the paragraph in question
would sound as harmless as it was intended to be.
But, lest Mrs. Andrews’s enemies (a charming
little matron never lacks enemies among her own
sex) may have chosen to assume that she made
excuses for “ the more shocking portions of
Shelley’s life and writings,” and sympathised
with the sexual giddiness of “ Laon and Cythna,”
The Bulletin now rises, with its hand on its
heart, to exonerate Mrs. Andrews from all sus-
picion of having said aught that could turn the
palest curate pink. So far from defending Shel-
ley’s free-love doctrines, she referred to him as a
painful “illustration of the evils to result from
the system he advocated,’’ and she said of “ Laon
and Cythna ” that “ the lawlessness of the human
passion is revolting in the extreme.”
** * *
Miss Elsie Adair and her “New York
Vaudeville Co.” took possession of Melb. Bijou
on Saturday, and a crowded audience sat out the
proceedings with admirable fortitude. Miss
Adair’s Co.—they have worked their way up-
wards from Adelaide and Broken Hill—includes
half-a-dozen persons actually apparent in the flesh,
and one invisible warbler, whose maudlin ballads
are illustrated by photographs on a sheet. Also,
the same sheet, or a larger piece of calico, is
devoted to the melancholy reflections of a
shadow pantomime, wherein a male shadow
appears to spit fluid at the face of his lydy
friend. The artists engaged in this choice item
don’t appear on the programme. Probably they
are chosen from 11 members of the working staff,
and, maybe, it is an usher or the deputy-
assistant electrician who spits as aforesaid. Con-
sidering the size of the entertainment, the mana-
gerial expenditure on working-staff amounts to
reckless prodigality. Miss Adair’s entertainment
is bounded on the north by a “ dramatic idyll ” (a
mawkish, but well-written sketch, introducing two
men and a child), and on the south by a rural
Yankee comedy, composed chiefly of a rural
gal sitting on a kitchen-table with taters
in her lap, and two nice legs dangling in space.
Why, 0 why, does Yankee comedy lay so much
stress upon taters ? The middle portion of the
programme is a succession of individual turns by
the three principal vaudevillers. These turns
would be more satisfactory if cut shorter. The
ventriloquist, Hugh Emmett, is quite up to the
average, but unduly drawn out. Percy Clifton
sings three similar comic songs without a change
of costume, and Miss Adair, besides singing
sundry ditto in bright style, gives five “gorgeous
dance creations ” with limelight effects. Her
dancing is of the monotonous serpentine order—
an agitation of flowing drapery by two sticks.
Although the limelight eventually broke down
from exhaustion on Saturday night, Miss Adair
got plenty of chance to suggest that her under-
drapery displays, plain and colored, were not more
.striking than the Gurl of Yarmouth’s efforts on
the same lines. In fact, Yarmouth, being tall
and thin, and pretty strong in the arms, was
probably the best vision with two sticks that Mel-
bourne has seen, and the city has had enough
serpentine, anyhow.

Harry Furniss, at the Athenaeum Hall,
has improved on acquaintance, his second yarn,
4-u j? el^Ca * n a Hmr y>” being more humorous than
the first. If the stout little caricaturist were to
cut a thousand words or so from his crowded talk
and leave himself time to speak the remainder in
an incidental manner, as though he hadn't learned
them by heart, he might be often funnier than his
pictures. As it is, he continues to get off two
cheerful bits of monologue without the aid of
illustrations. One piece is a burlesque imitation
of the volcanic lalmage, for which The Bulletin
tenders the genial Britisher an earnest blessing.
Harry I urmss is to give two new monologues ere
leaving for Sydney. Meanwhile, R. 8. Smythe
who has carefully refrained from listening to any
of his previous “stars,” is observed to be paying
serious attention to Furniss. The two celebrities
are much about the same height, and in the event
of lurmss falling suddenly ill in the middle of an
entertainment, Smythe will pick up the thread of
discourse and fire away without much fear of dis-

Sydney organists are furious over the remarks made «
the handling, by some of their number, of the Town Hail
organ during Wiegand’s absence in Europe. The Town
Hall officials seem unanimous in deriding the idea of
local organists being a “ draw.” The town-clerk charae
terised the affair as “an utter failure.” The Mayor went
further: ‘‘The receipts hardly paid lighting and
blowing expenses.” ® s '
Dear Bulletin,— David Lee, the late Melb. city organist
was not “ a large, athletic person,” but a small tallowv
man. It is true that Best, when in Melb., refused to
touch the old-fashioned instrument, which, he said was
fit only for a bullock to perform upon. David Lee how
ever, managed to get over the difficulty—whatever it mav
be—without bringing much muscle into play. He pulled
out the noisiest “ stops ” seemingly, and thumped the
keys with moderate vigor.—W.

Haresfoot: “ How opinions differ ! I thought Darlev’s
Mercutio greatly inferior to Cecil Ward’s, but Ward
marred the Queen Mab speech by over-acting it. These
purple patches of Shakespeare must not be acted, or the
performer is distracting attention from the matchless
language to himself. Thus with the Seven Ages, Beliew
in Romeo's speech about the apothecary, gave Ward the
proper line. Same with the clergy reading Scripture and
trying to paint the lily and gild refined gold. All’they
have to do is to be merely water-pipes. Otherwise it is
impertinence.”
Harry Paulton takes occasion to quarrel with ‘‘Mrs
Tanquera.v,” for her dying behind the scenes. Just gives
one occasion to remark that the French have a stage
morality of punctilio on items wherein the English are not
squeamish. For instance, no French audience will endure
Othello strangling Desdemona. It was a question whether
Mrs. Tanqueray would not offend French prudeiw
In short, what Lamb and Hazlitt, and even Thackeray
write, in an over-strained way, about the innocence of
the often vile work of Wycherley, Farquhar, and Van-
brugh, not to speak of Etheredge and Rochester, applies
better to modern French comedy, like Paulton’s “ Night
Out”—that it is conducted in an imaginary and unreal
world, not amenable to everyday morality.
Melb. : “ A St. Kilda livery-stabler was enjoying the
fire-scene of ‘ In Sight of St. Paul’s,’ this week, while his
own extensive premises were burnt down. Once a father
and mother, in North Melb., locked up their house with
three children, all they had, and went to a funny play.
When they returned, the children were all burnt to
death.”
Timi: “ What became of the South Sea Island opera
written years ago by John Liddell Kelly, the Maoriland
poet, music by Neville Barnett? One or two of the lyrics
of this work appear in Douglas Sladen’s pocket-edition of
‘ Australian Poets.’ ”
Some amusement was caused at a Sydney tneatre on
Queen’s Birthday night by Inspector Lenthal'l, the officer
having control of places of amusement, gazing profoundly
at the stalls, where there were some five seats filled ; then at
a small knot of people in the centre of the dress-circle and
a smattering round the gods’ rail. Having satisfied him-
self that there was no danger from overcrowding, the
official took his departure with the air of a man who had
done his duty.
Harry Rickards, in the course of an interview In Lon-
don, states that in future, when engaging* expensive
artists, it will only be for four months certain, with the
option of a further couple of months if they “ take.” Pre-
vious engagements have been for six months, and
Rickards finds that some big artists are only a paving
commodity for about four months, as all the likely people
in Australia will have seen them in that time, and they
will have to be exceptionally good to “ draw’ ” thereafter.
Brother Bill Rignold tells how, when playing Ratcliff to
Barry Sullivan’s Richard 111., at Sadler's Wells, he re-
ceived special instructions to stand, in the fifth act wait-
ing for his cue—“ Give me another horse; bind up my
wounds,” &c., with the king's sword held across his
palms, and present it thus at the end of the soliloquy
> r L terested in t- he scene, he forgot these directions,
and held the sword hilt upwards over his shoulder, and so
entered and presented it to the king. This was no sooner
done than Barry Sullivan, swearing and howling w’ith
pain, threw it down and roared, “ Where the devil have
you been holding that sword ? ” Then Brother Bill found
he had been unconsciously heating the hilt in a gas-iet
while waiting to go on. J

The Australian Amateur Opera Co. will do ‘iThe Gon-

of two local hospitals—the St. Vincent’s and the In-

Melb. : “ That tinder-box, the Opera House, is to be
re-built at last, and meanwhile the Rickards co. will

Gladstone Wright’s “ Concert Direction, Entertain-
ment and General Agency ” made a successful start with
a concert at Melb. Town Hall, on Queen’s Birthday night.
The agency, copied from the latest London models, has
an office at 77 iSwanston-street, Melb., and seems likely to
flourish. Gladstone Wright, who is somewhat of a
Church and Stage Guild in himself, undertakes to supply
living pictures, soloists for church-choirs, stage-fittings,
and vocal material for first-class concerts, public or pri-


vate at short notice. Also, a school of singing is
attached to the agency, whereat soulless warblers may
get instruction in the art of throwing out their chests
and trilling a lay with expression.
Furniss’s “lectures” are not Radical intone. Those

ture ; Bradlaugh never a “hand.”
1. j a ck” Crain, now “ in front” at Sydney Opera House,
had as a youngster, a tenor voice of world-paralysing
potentialities, but a throat weakness ruined it. Crain
was a student at Milan Conservatoire, where he was a con-
temporary of another musical Sydneyite, D’Orson, the
voice-production expert. Crain, by the way, was in the
first “ Pinafore” caste that performed in Maoriland.
A Frenchman is showing at Lyons a piano-plaving
ourang-outang. The instrument used is a specially-
manufactured one, and the ape performs the first half of
the “ Marseillaise” by ear with creditable execution. The
owner is sanguine of adding to the monkey’s repertoire.
“Lelamine” is being re-written. In the new edition
Pkre Joseph will have no connection with the church, but
will be, as his song says, “ a rascally editor ” all through
the piece. The opera, they say, is to be given at a
matinee at the Princess’s, probably on Saturday, June 12,
for the benefit of the composer.
Geo. Lauri, Juliet Wray, and Minna Phillips have all
parts in the next Princess production, “My Friend from
India.” Cecil Ward’s name is not in the cast.
Daisy Chamier, daughter of Geo. Chamier, C.E., of
Sydney, has gone to Leipsic Conservatoire for further
study. The young Australian student has already dis-
played conspicuous talent. She studied the piano under
Madame Charbonnet Kellerman, obtaining the gold medal
at Madanie’s Conservatoire, and also gold medal for piano-
forte playing at the Australian Musical Association’s
exam, in ’95. One of her compositions has been accepted
by a London publisher.
Leon Caron is about to visit Paris. His wife (Miss Elsa
Sherwin) and children will accompany him. A move-
ment is abroad in musical circles for a benefit.
Harry Paulton, of the Firm’s new comedy co., was mis-
taken for Billy Elton, skirmishing about the back of the
d.c. on several recent nights. The resemblance is
marked—size, figure, face, and the same perky, bird-like
movements.
Moulton, composer of “ Lelamine,” is organist at N.
Melb. Presbyterian Church, and, of course, a “ teacher of
the pianoforte and singing.” The production of his opera,
if it does nothing else, will probably bring him more
pupils. Advt. is the immortal soul of business.
Haresfoot: “‘Lelamine’ suggested to me how inevitably
superior the amateur chorus must be to the professional
in the important point of being natural, while its vocalism
has the charm of freshness in the voices, and spontaneity.
What the irritated tutor is always trying to drill into the
professional, the amateur does of herself —that is to say,
takes an intelligent interest in the proceedings. Of
course, the demoralisation of the ‘ Lelamine ’ maidens
began, in a histrionic point of view, from the very first
night, after which they mostly began striving to appear
careless and unconcerned, in emulation of their weary
sisters who work for a few shillings a week.”
Theorbo : “ What surprising fresh young voices Bracy
has unearthed. Mavis, Darley, Spencer, Ralfe, Rebottarc,
all marked for more than a little distinction, in light
music.”
Shakespeare, who was down upon a good many popular
frauds, didn’t forget to cut his little joke at palmistry.
Shylock’s servant, Gobbo, gazing at the palm of his left
hand, says : “ Go to, here’s a simple line of life 1 here’s a
small trifle of wives : Aas, fifteen wives is nothing ; eleven
widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man ;
and then to ’scape drowning thrtce ; and to be in peril of
my life with the edge of a feather bed ; here are simple
’scapes.” Gobbo was born 300 years ago, but he’s not
dead yet.
Thomas A. Edison, the great inventor, has
just produced the “ HOME ” phonograph, which,
as the name implies, is intended to supply the de-
mand for an instrument for private use having all
the vital points of the expensive exhibition phono-
graph combined with a low price. This new
" talking machine,” costing only =£l2, will soon be
found in every house in the country, as it affords
infinite amusement and instruction, and is also in-
dispensable in an up-to-date office. The manager
of the Edison Electric Parlor (162 Pitt-st., Sydney)
reports a strong demand.*
The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The South Australian loan just floated in Lon-
don gives Treasurer Holder a high place among financial
imbeciles. S.A. had a large amount of local Treasury
bills (bearing interest at £4 11s. 3d. percent, per annum)
to redeem, and it was necessary either to persuade the
owners to renew or else float a conversion loan. Holder
first of all offered the owners the option of taking 3 per
cent, stock at par in exchange. There was no great rush
to accept, and Holder straightway offered a £1,000,000
3 per cent, loan in London at £95. That is to say, he
offered to sell the S.A. Government securities to John
Bull at £5 less than the price at which they were tendered
to the S.A. holder of Treasury bills. As for the general
public of S.A., it wasn’t offered a chance even at par.
Moreover, as floating the loan in London means paying
12s. 6d. per cent, stamp-duty to the British Government
and at least 7s. 6d. per cent, in other expenses, Holder
was really offering to accept from J. Bull less than £94
for the securities which he wouldn’t offer in Australia
below £lOO.
Holder’s explanation was that the money would
have to be remitted to London to pay charges there, and
allowing for cost of exchange it would be as profitable to
get £9B 10s. in London as £lOO in Adelaide. This argu-
ment only shows his utter incapacity to see the bearing of
things. Some time or other the money must be repaid
by sending it from S.A. to London, and, therefore, the
cost of remittance must be paid sooner or later. Conse-
quently, he doesn’t save the cost of remittance as he
alleges; he merely postpones it. Also there are other
items to be taken into consideration. Floating a loan
locally means saving the cost of sending the interest to
England every half-year for, perhaps, a few centuries ;
and it means that part of the interest payments will come
back to the State as income-tax. These two items, in the
course of years, would far more than make up for the one
immediate saving in cost of remittance which Mr. Holder
was so anxious to effect. Further, local flotation would keep
£30,000 a year interest in the country, and as there is far
more than a million lying idle and earning absolutely
nothing in the local banks it would be £30,000 a year
saved with no loss whatever to set against it. And, in any
case, the fact —if it had been a fact —that £lOO in Adelaide
was only equal to £9B 10s. in London was no explanation
of the unspeakable foolishness which fixed the net mini-
mum in Adelaide at £lOO and in London (after allowing
for expenses) at £94. Thirty shillings isn’t £6.
The fact that a loan was going to be offered in
London was not definitely known in Adelaide. The local
capitalists probably imagined they would be allowed a
chance to come in, and so they waited for their opportunity
and were left. How suddenly they were left may be seen
in the fact that holders of Treasury bills were allowed till
25th May to accept stock in repayment, yet the loan was
actually offered in London on the 24th. And when S.A.’s
financial bungler had put his loan on the London market
at a minimum of £95 (or less than * 94 net), he was rushed
in a single day with offers of 1560,000 in Adelaide, where
there would be practically no expenses, at £9B and £9B
10s. Other offers came in later on. This covered the
whole amount immediately required ; the other £440,000
isn’t wanted for about a year. Judging by all appear-
ances, therefore, it would seem that the S.A. Government
could certainly have got the balance locally when it was
wanted, and thus have saved a year’s interest as well as
expenses. The net result was that the amount of the
loan was increased needlessly to £1,060,000, so as to give
some of the local tenderers a show. The S.A. people take
about half of it at £9B and £9B 10s. John Bull takes the
rest at something like £95 10s., after deducting expenses
—the exact figures are not yet available. The country
pays about £12,000 extra in interest through doing the
flotation in one lump instead of getting the money in
Adelaide as required, and loses a lot more through selling
to Bull at a reduced rate. And a fine chance to make
S.A. independent of the British money-lender has been
stupidly muddled away.

Westralia is now spending loan money at the
rate of about £1,350,000 a year, which, in proportion to
population, is about the same as if N.S.W. spent
£10,000,000 a year or Victoria £9,000,000. This is abso-
lutely the biggest, wildest, maddest borrowing orgy that
even Australia ever saw. And the difficulty of raising
money is becoming very great. A few months ago Wes-
tralia got out of a tight place by selling £480,000 worth of
Treasury bills to the banks at 4 per cent., and it is said to
be arranging for the sale of another £500,000 worth at 4J
per cent. ! These rates show what the banks, at all events,
think of Westralian credit. Also, a third issue of
£500,000 worth of Treasury bills is rumored for the latter
part of this year or somewhere early in ’9B. When the
borrowing has to stop, or at least to greatly diminish,
what a historic collapse there will be !

Item from the report of the London committee
of A.J.S. Bank depositors : “ The committee were desirous
that a specific amount of the capital of the bank should
be written off to provide for estimated loss, but they
eventually considered it better to leave this important
matter to the decision of the new board of directors, to
which the depositors will be entitled to elect three mem-
bers.” This is a specific intimation that, in the com-
mittee’s opinion, a part of the capital has been lost, but
how much isn’t even hinted. The Bulletin suggested
the same thing a good many months ago when it pointed
out that the old reserve-fund, set aside to meet losses,
stood in the balance-sheet at £573,000 at December, ’95,
while at December, ’96, it had vanished altogether. This
seemed to imply that the losses were rolling in very fast,
and when the reserve becomes exhausted the only way to
cover any further losses is by writing down capital. The
A.J.S. has only about £1,200,000 of shareholders’ funds
altogether, and even a moderate writing-off, as these
things go nowadays, would reduce it to the rank of a very
second-rate institution.

The New York Life Insurance Co.’s 1896
balance-sheet shows a premium income of £6,407,011,
being £168,000 more than last year. Interest and rents
(£1,646,396) are £BB,OOO more than last year. The income
thus reaches a splendid total of £8,053,407, and of this
£2,621,523 is added to the accumulated funds, making
them £38,513,663, and there is a surplus of assets over
liabilities of £5,490,122. This surplus, however, is arrived
at by estimating that the accumulated funds will return
4 per cent, per annum permanently. All the three big
American offices doing business in Australia estimate on
the 4 per cent, basis (so do most Australian offices,
by the way), and if instead they estimated future
interest at £3 12s. 6d. per cent., as is done by the A.M.P.
Society and the Maoriland Government Life Assurance
Department, or at £3 10s. per cent., as the A.M.P. and
Mutual Life Association are both preparing to do, it would
make a very large hole in the three sensational surpluses.
The New York earns less than 4)4 per cent, inter-
est, and the margin is very small according to Aus-
tralian ideas. The weakest point about the New
York Life, however, as with the other two “ American
giants,” is the expense rate. This has been largely
reduced of late, but even now expenses absorb 25
per cent, of premiums or 20 per cent, of total income. In
1895 (the last year for which complete returns are avail-
able), the A.M.P. spent less than 9 per cent, of its total
income in expenses ; Maoriland Government Department
about 13 per cent., National Mutual 18£ per cent,., and
the Widows’ Fund, Mutual Life Association and Colonial
Mutual each a fraction under 20 per cent. All these, ex-
cept the A.M.P., are very much smaller and younger than
the New York Life; and even the A.M.P. is also much
smaller. By comparison, especially with the A.M.P. and
Maoriland Government Department, the expense-rate
of the American office looks wildly extravagant.
The best feature about the American offices
is that their securities are reported, by an independent
state auditor, to be absolutely sound and worth
every penny of the value set against them, and if a
similar officer gave the same guarantee about the Aus-
tralian offices it would be very much better for them. The
Maoriland Government Department, which is not only
State-audited but State-guaranteed, is the only one which
is distinctlv ahead of even the American institutions in
this as well as every other respect. The biggest surplus
shown by any American institution as a guarantee for its
policy-holders is the Equitable’s—£9,6oo,ooo. The Maori-
land institution’s surplus is just about £lso,ooo,ooo—in
other words, it consists of the entire assets and credit of
the province. « * »
An agreement has been arrived at among the
fire insurance companies to greatly increase rates in and
around Melbourne, and a feeble kick among property-
holders naturally ensues. Fire insurance in Melbourne
doesn’t pay to any extent worth speaking of at present
rates The only way to make it pay is to increase rates
or to reduce expenses. The latter are the chief source of
trouble ; in 1895 the Australian fire and marine companies
spent £330,000 in expenses to earn £1,071,000 in premiums.
There are far too many companies in the business, there-
fore there are too many offices and managers and directors
and staffs and separate sets of furniture and stationery to
maintain. Also the competition makes it necessary to
pav away far too much in commission to get business at
all And as new English, French, German, Austrian,
Swiss Italian, Chinese and Japanese companies keep
opening branches in Australia, the competition gets
worse instead of better, and as it gets worse the expense
rate must get heavier and insurance rates must grow
larger There are only two visible remedies. Either
the Government must levy special taxation on the
foreign companies taxation heavy enough to clear
a large proportion of them out and thus reduce
the ruinous competition. Or else it must clear all
the offices out, and make fire insurance a state monopoly,
and insure everybody’s property by compulsion. This
would entirely do away with the heavy charge for com-
mission, and economise offices ; where there are now 23
fire insurance offices in Pitt-street, Sydney, alone, one
would be sufficient, and the other 22 rents would be
saved. Also, the abandonment of 22 big offices in one
street would make a grievous slump in rents, consequently
the property-owner is distinctly hostile. A State fire-in-
surance department on the compulsory principle could
do business at the present rates and make a handsome
profit out of them ; and the present rates could be made
to pay—though not nearly so well—if a wholesale eject-
ment of the foreign companies were effected. Otherwise
rates must go up and the man who wants to protect his
house or his tables and chairs from combustion must
stand it the best way he can.

For every <£l paid in mining and ore-dressing
wages by the B.H. Junction Co. last half-year £2 12s. re-
presented the shareholders’ profit. But never again—
with the ore at present developed, anyway.
On the last half-year’s work the Junction made
a profit of £1 3s. 4d. per ton of ore ; Block 10, 12s. 7d.;
Block 14, 4s. lid. But as the Junction used up so much
of its high-grade stuff the comparison, so far as it is con-
cerned, is not a fair one. The gross value of the Block 14
product was £2 9s. 3d. per ton of ore.
What the still-inefficient sulphide treatment by
concentration means in the way of machinery may be
judged by the statement of the Block 14 directors that
they have spent £52,103 in machinery in the last three
years.
Block 10 has made a capital recovery ; in the
six months to the end of March £20,000 was paid in divs.,
and £2OOO spent on machinery, and liquid assets in-
creased by £l3OO. And as more ore is now being treated
and the plant is running more regularly, no difficulty
should be experienced in keeping this up—assuming there
is no further slump in silver. The financial position is,
for these times, uncommonly strong.
The general-manager of Block 10 claims that
his concentrating plant for sulphides is doing as good
work as, if not better than, any other on the Hill. And
this is what it did : The quantity of crude ore treated was
41,519 tons, assaying 19'08oz. silver, 20'06 per cent, lead,
and 29'41 per cent. zinc. This produced 9969 tons con-
centrates, assaying 33'170z. silver, 64'84 per cent, lead,
and 9'57 per cent, zinc; also 2100 tons slimes, assaying
28oz. silver, 21 per cent, lead, and 28 per cent. zinc. The
total result thus shows a recovery of 49T6 per cent, of the
contained silver, and 82'66 per cent, of the contained lead.
But the slimes are of comparatively little value, on ac-
count of the high percentage of zinc (due to the very in-
timate association of the zinc and silver), so that for all
practical purposes the recovery of the metals is consider-
ably less than that stated. Practically, in order to elimin-
ate two-thirds of the zinc and some gangue, three-fifths
of the silver and one-fourth of the lead are sent away with
the tailings ! There is, obviously, still room for the in-
ventor.

In the wild-boom days of Coolgardie, when
cargoes of gold and champagne were imported from Eng-
land, every opportunity for a razzle-dazzle was taken.
One of the chief dazzlers was a well-known mining “ cap-
tain” whose razzle-preliminary formula was : “ Genelmen,
fill yer glasses and drink with me, as man to man, the
’ealth of the cappittalists who ’ave ’onored us with their
presence ’ere this hevening.”
Says a paper printed at Hannan’s, W.A.: “If
the disposition of the financial world towards West Aus-
tralian mining were influenced by developments, there
have been, during the present year, sufficient to create a
far greater boom than any yet experienced. The rich
telluride discoveries that have been made in almost a
dozen mines, the marvellous yields from the ore sent to
South Australia from the Brown Hill and other properties,
the wonderful strike of almost pure gold in the Great
Boulder,” &c. But booms don’t follow on the heels of
each other. The boom has been and gone, and a very
long time must elapse before Kalgoorlie or any part of
Westralia sees another.
Coolgardie has decided on holding a mining
exhibition at a cost of £lO,OOO. It will enable Coolgardie
to make an exhibition of itself. As a place which has spent,
within a radius of three miles, the most money on
mines with the least result, Coolgardie would take first
prize against the world.

“ Veldt ” to The Bulletin :
In the Riverina things are about as bad as they can be.
Lambing has begun, and thousands of lambs are being
killed to save the mothers. The former must die, any-
way, as the ewes have no milk. Last week I saw two
cows bogged in about 6in. of mud ; one died in her
struggles, the other was dug out. On Eunonyhareenyha
station men are employed cutting down box timber to
feed the sheep. Other stations are just as badly off, many
of them feeding their flocks on barley and wheat-straw
and treacle. For miles around not a vestige of grass is to
be seen, and as soon as the cold weather sets in the mor-
tality amongst stock will be awful. I have seen during
the past few days cattle (or rather skeletons) eating fresh
horse-dung. The farmers also are in a very bad way ; a

The tick question is a queer one to settle,
In N Q. you will see in some parts grass as red as

bird alighting on the herbage carries off the bud-
ding pests in thousands. A swaggie’s blankets
swarm with them. The only wav of blocking
them will bo to cut off a strip of quarantine
eountry on the south ; dip every swaggie who
passes in croton oil or sulphuric acid, and shoot
every bird that flies overhead. The Boers almost
go as far to check the rinderpest.

A Brisbane (Q.) paper was called upon
everybody within its hail to drink (at each’s own
expense) a Birthday toast to Her Gracious, “by
virtue of her maternity and pre-eminent widow-
hood.” Grovel in black crape, with a mug of beer
at its mouth ! “ Pre-eminent widowhood ! ” The
writer knew a woman who, at her last widowhood,
had lost her fifth husband. She’s now got another,
She was more eminent in widowhood than Queen
Victoria, who, if report speaks truly, would have
married again but for her Cabinet Ministers’
advice not to chance further possibilities. The
six-times married woman didn’t fret much over
her fifth ; she merely said—“ Well, that’s another
decent man gone. Well, well; they turns up un-
expectedly, and then they turns up their toes
unexpectedly. I suppose Ben, down in the
pocket, will be axing me next. He was too late

anniversary. At this rate the chances are that
the illuminated addresses will reach 40,000, quite
apart from telegrams and letters. The only
possible result is that Victoria’s secretary will hire
Fix or eight or ten supercilious understrappers
who will cackle derisively about the grammar of
the various grovellers (including N.S.W. Par-
liament) and send each one a circular of per-
functory thanks. No one expects any tired old
lady of nearly 80 to look at all the mass of rub-
bish. The best that can happen to it is that it
will all be put away somewhere in packing-cases
and gnawed by rats, and the worst is that it will
be combusted under the boiler on washing-day.
Possibly a list of the senders may be placed before
Her Gracious, and anybody who has ever read
right through the Melbourne directory for amuse-
ment will understand exactly what will happen
to it.

Record Reign illuminations in Adelaide, either
publicly or privately.

Essendon (Melb.) Town Council proposes
to celebrate the Record-Reign by “ building a lake,
and erecting an island in the centre of it.” The
man who is so glad because an old lady he never
saw is still alive, that he must dig a hole to give
vent to his happiness, is a fine specimen of the art
of rejoicing with difficulty. The Bulletin sug-
gests, as an amendment, that the Essendon coun-
cillors rejoice by each carrying a mangle to Pascoe
Vale and back. The sort of man who must give
vent to his gladness by humping something heavy
would find a lot of mental outlet by carrying a
mangle.

‘' Considerations for the coming J übilee
and the Queen’s superstitious apprehensions have
influenced the * dailies ’ to almost pass over the
explosion in the Underground Railway,” writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent. “The
bomb had been placed on the floor of a first-class
, V , i , ~, , • , ,
carriage the only Ist on the tram, and empty
and exploded just as the engine pulled up at
Aldersgate-street, a large station open up to the
sky excepting for an iron roof 40ft. above the
rails. Those waiting on the platform received the
force of the explosion, which blew three compart-
ments clean out, walls and roof, scattering the
fragments and broken glass like some hugefou -
gasse in the faces of the unfortunates. One man
had an eight-inch javelin of glass through his
collar and stuck in his neck. The scene of anni-
hilated wreckage presented half-an-hour after the
occurrence convinced your correspondent that no
gas cylinder explosion had done the damage,
Where it is supposed the explosive lay a jagged
gap yawned in the solid diagonal flooring of the
carriage, and the frames of two shattered windows
and a crumpled hat-rack were all that was
left of the three compartments. Had the ex-
plosion taken place 50 yards earlier in the tunnel
the holocaust would have been hellish.”

Clearly, the Melb. section of the Harmy
takes no interest in local politics. At the opening
of its Workmen’s Metropole (where customers
can get a square-meal, with or without salvation
for a penny), ‘‘Commandant” Booth referred
to Attorney-General Isaacs as “His Honor Sir
Isaac Isaacs, Chief Justice of Victoria,” and
the multitude accepted the statement quite
seriously. Bv the way, there was a wholesome
snub for the Presbyterians, if they would only
take it, in the aforesaid Harmy function. Booth
carelessly mixed up the identities of Jewish
Isaacs and Roman Catholic Madden, whilst two
other Jews, brother Johnnie Isaacs and Zox,
stood around taking a hand in the inauguration of
a practical Christian work. A suitable moment for
the Presbyterian missionary to come forward and
preach the blessed terewth to that trio of public
Unbelievers.

scribess says Princess
Christian’s selection

lesser rank into the
precincts of a palace,
showingthat the joys
and sorrows of a
royal lady differ not
at all in degree, or
even in kind, from
those we all know ”
—the apparent as-
sumption being that
it is matter for re-
verent astonishment
that a “royal lady’s”
feelings should con-
descend to have any
vulgar human affin-
ity with those of
“women of lesser
rank.” The woman
snob is the snob.

Melb. : “The Honorable Ithaac Ithaacs,
a young lion of the tribe of Judah, opens the
Workmen’s Metropole, under the auspices of a
brother Israelite, Herbert Booth, one of the Lost
Tribes, probably Zebulun or Naphtali, for he

“ It is not surprising,” writes ;i
Bulletin correspondent, “to hear
that one of the female practitioners
bo highly eulogised after a year’6
service at the big Melb. ‘ mixed ’
hospital lately applied in vain for a
position at the Women’s Hospital,
where patients, as a rule, are accou-
chement cases. This temple of ma-
ternity is run by women of the well-
dressed persuasion, whose own little
interesting events were doubtless con-
ducted under conditions which streng-
thened their early belief in the man-
doctor, or, rather, inclined them natu-
rally to the idea that an accoucheur
is quite as ‘proper ’ as an accoucheuse,
if not more so. Any Australian
mother of 20 years’ standing, having
brought forth children at a time when
the medical business out here was re-
stricted to men, is slow to admit the
hideous humbug of her old idea.
Regarding herself as a paragon of
matronly modesty, she can’t see why
girls should object to a man’s medical
attendance in the most delicate of
cases. In other words, she considers
lady doctors quite unnecessary to
society, even if they be not actually
improper. Women are either warmly
in favor of the woman-doctor prin-
ciple, or distinctly opposed to it, and
the bulk of the opposition springs
from the same sentiment that moved
the tailless animal in the fable to
advocate a sacrifice of tails all round.
I don’t impute tailless animal senti-
ment to the Melb. Women’s Hospital
Committee. I merely say that most
elderly women, and all elderly mo-
thers, have acquired a taste for male
doctors, or say, rather, a distaste for
the female ditto.”

At Melb. District Court, recently, one Ah
Din was fined 10s. 6d. for working on April 7 last
U.e., for not taking the prescribed half-holiday).
Ah' Quay, presumably because he worked harder,
was fined <£s. As neither Chow paid, both were
ordered to be imprisoned, which provoked Ah
l)in to give his opinion of Vic. law to the senior-
constable. “Man no wuck he go gaol,” he
pleaded, “man wuck he go gaol allee same,

In consequence of the conflicting provi-
sions of the Merchant Shipping Act and the
Chinese restriction legislation of N.S.W., sea cap-
tains commanding vessels manned by Chinese
crews have frequently a hard row to hoe. If a
slant-eyed tar commits a breach of discipline
the captain cannot threaten him with the terrors of
the Merchant Shipping Act, as the authorities
ashore will not take the recalcitrant alien into
custody unless his <£loo poll-tax be paid. The
sea-faring Chow knows the weakness of the law
and takes advantage of it. And this is the con-
dition of affairs which led to the bastinadoing of
two Chinese sailors on the Tsinan and the subse-
quent fining of the captain and chief-officer.

The Cairns Council—Cairns, as already
stated, is the place where every white man doffs
his hat to all Chinamen—met, the other day, and
decided not to interfere with the joyous little pro-
ceedings of the 37 Japanese ladies setted in the
“beautiful city.” It was alleged, in justification,
that unless the salacious Kanaka were allowed
some outlet for his exuberance, Cairns women
would be exposed to the same dangers as their
sisters in Bundaberg and Mackay. How the alien
curse is working ! The Kanaka is made the plea
for the admission of the Japanese prostitute ; the
Jap prostitute brings the Jap male bully : the
bully sends for his relatives—and so on. One
hopes that the Cairns Council was not also con-
sidering the interests of certain swell whites who
patronise the local Yoshiwara.

One party has opened a fancy-goods store right in

respectable white woman (whose husband was inutile hos-
pital with fever) tried to support herself and young family
by taking in washing and ironing, but could not get
enough to make a living, as all the hotels, private fami-
lies, and most of the single men in the town send their
washing to the Japs., who do it at rates that can t be
competed with by white women. This is a goldfields

“ What shall we plant in the fruitful soil
Of hearts quite young and fresh ?

Since Pleasure is our profesh.
What shall we plant in our youth-time strong,
Ere the sun of its gladness sets ;
Something to last us a whole life long ? ”
The Devil said : “ Plant regrets.
“ Feebly at first they may seem to grow,
For the surface soil is light;
But their roots strike deep in the ground below ;
They get along then all right.
Clusters of berries galore they bear,
Whose flavor one never forgets ;
What shall you plant in your youth-time fair? ”
Cried Nicholas : “ Plant regrets.”

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
»r tv „ Sydney, June 1, 1897.
Mr Deab Mtke—
The University Sports Union ball in Padding-
ton Town Hall, on Tuesday of last week, was an-
nounced to be in honor of the visiting boat-race
crews irom Melb. and Adelaide, but, as the Melb
crew had left for its native seat of learning in
Gar] ton the day before, it was a somewhat belated
level. It was a youthful festivity, chaperons were
dotted at rare intervals along the walls, and each
Jarge matron seemed to be chaperoning at least
half-a-dozen pretty girls. The officials were
haunted by fear that the crop of wall-flowers
would be heavy, as the women’s tickets sold far
outnumbered the men’s, until the morning of the
event when the market for men's pasteboards
prew brisk, and numbers were about equal. Late
in the evening most of the magnates, who had been
at the Govt. House festivity, arrived, and brought
with them an impression of diamonds and gorgeous
apparel, and gave the requisite tone to the party.
Consumptives are a fashionable craze just now
among a few dozen other charities. To raise
money for the proposed hospital nearly every
sassiety person is hard at work thinking up anew
scheme for entertainments at so much per head,
the proceeds to be given to the pet object,
the thinking generally results in urgent letters
demanding professional assistance. I have seen
many replies, nearly all in the affirmative. The
reallj' generous persons in the case are the profes-
sionals who give time, talent, and trouble gratis,
and cheapen their own future efforts. The pro-
fessional musician or performer of any kind who
is engineered by an energetic sassiety worker into
showing for chanty ”is his own most formidable
rival and nobody knows that fact better than the
pro. himself. And yet the fact rarely stands in
the way of generous professional assistance freely
given to every charity-boom. A committee is
working up a Consumptive-hospital appeal for
. line rejoicings. A theatrical carnival and a mon-
ster concert are both in the plan of campaign.
<< eu nC u-* 1 ? r raid , for charit y i s organising in aid of
the distressed poor of Sydney and suburbs.” It
will be called the “Diamond Jubilee Charity
Carnival, to take place in August, and the pro-
gramme shows that every known form of enter-
tainment will be offered in order to collect coin
from the most diverse pockets. “ A Jubilee Doll
bhow ought to be a success. Think of the
opportunity of dressing up a miniature wax-works
show of the whole royal family. Or, really in-
teresting models of the fashions of sixty years
ITI -?wi b( ' mado ’ T a little effigy could be adorned
with the collars of the G.0.M., or a happy family
group dressed, showing all the Australian premiers
waited on by royal. flunkeys, the doll-footmen in
the gaudy St. James livery. A doll-show is a
decidedly bright idea.
Special appeals just now include the “Queens
Jubilee Fund ” for distressed women. The his-
tory of this fund proves that cliqueism kills
charity. Begun under Govt. House auspices
ten years ago in the loyal outburst of that
time, money rolled in plentifully at first
i he r e was a distinctly toney flavor about
the offerings All the officials were chosen from
among the Nicest only, and the charity was kept
so very select that it gradually dwindled and
pined from anaemia, and the mangles and sewing-
machines distributed to “ deserving cases ” had to
be wrung reluctantly from a limited circle. Now
when the fund is anxious to make a fresh start, the
barriers of caste a,re broken down, and the com-
mon, vulgar public are begged for subscriptions,
and everybody s money is welcome, and, to make
the interest revive, the scheme is to be put on a
popular basis. When high society is administer-
ing the fund it is called “ the Queen’s Fund ” •
when the plebs have to be drummed for money*
they call it “the Distressed Women’s Fund.”
, Judging from the disputes which raged arouncf
the journalists’ “At Home,” given on behalf of
the Society of Artists, at the Gaiety Theatre, last
Saturday evening, there doesn’t seem any prospect
of establishing a Press Club in Sydney. What
the row was about nobody now seems to have a
very clear notion, but it raged furiously all the
time the preparations were making, culminating
in one_ daily s withdrawing itself in cold haughti-
ness from the proceedings and consigning all
notice of them to oblivion. The press clique
wouldn t join in with one another, or perhaps, as
most of the women-writers’ names were on the
list, the men fought shy of it, for the average press-
man does fight shy of the average presswoman.
A Journalists Club, including both men and
women, would never be representative, for a man’s
club without whisky and tobacco is unthinkable
and a man-and-woman club with whisky and
tobacco would probably be lively while it lasted,
but would end abruptly in about three months
with reverberations. The men who join a woman’s
club are proved by experience to be nice, neat
young men with a charming smile and a
little axe which they grind so industriously that at
the club meetings the whiz of the grindstone
drowns all other proceedings. But they aren’t
pressmen—the real pressman is gruff and untidy,
and not at all a ladies’ man.
The journalists and authors who were running
the at home ”on Saturday evening at the Guild
-tlall provided a good programme, including an
original fragment recited by Mr. J. S. Evison, a
few remarks by “Hop.,” and songs by Burns-
Wabker and Mr. Woodhouse; Miss M. Wynne
lifted her voice m S. Hoben’s “ Ave Maria,” with
vio in accompaniment by Mr. Stevenson, and
tlall ihorpe gave lightning caricatures. A short
play Lights Out,’ was given, and the evening
wound up with a dance. Mrs. Creed (Louise
Mack), Mrs. Aronson, and Mr. J. Ashton
received a party from Govt. House, and the com-
mittee was distinguished by white bows with
unstained quills stuck in them. There was a
large attendance of guests.
Usually a theatre audience consists of three
women to one man, but in the Opera House, the
old-fashioned operas performed by E. Farley’s Cos.
attract three times as many men as women. Men
are the much more sentimental sex at heart, and
consequently the pathos of “ The Heart Bowed
Down ' and ‘ When Other Lips ” hasn’t been
worn threadbare for them by repetition. It
is interesting to see the old operas re-staged, if
only to note how subsequent productions have
plagiarised from them. “ Carmen ” and “ The
Yeomen Guard ” both owe ideas to “ Mari-
«?TD a Y a P d or three characters from the
Bohemian Girl ” have been abstracted
bodily by “The Pirates.” On Saturday
night three songs were interpolated. Devils-
hoof was encored for “ Will o’ the Wisp ”
with realistic effects like the flying match-
trick at the Jordans ; Miss Maud Lita, a pretty
Selina, warbled “ Good Bye,’’ and Miss M. Glen-
~en£in£ aid her turn before a mysterious black
cloth with faint murky lettering like an advertise-
ment-hoarding in Tophet. The ladies of this co.
are decidedly taking—perhaps that accounts for
the well-manned house—even to baby Arline, a
c f , ' m a pd placid infant who never wails even when
the firing is on. The costuming is bright but
scrappy. A chorus man lurking mostly up stage
m a brown rug and fat white stockings made
people blush at the mere idea of what would hap-
pen if he were to relax the tight clutch he kept on
bis garments.
How the nicest ” economise. A seamstress
writes me that a well-known family in Sydney
society circles ” lately employed her as dress-
maker for six weeks at a merely nominal wage.
She understood that her engagement was for
female work only, and was considerably surprised
when she was asked to make a couple of pairs of
trousers and a frock coat for Mr. . She pro-
tested, and was promptly told that if she did not
care to do it there were plenty of others. The
coat and pants were duly made to the complete
satisfaction of the wearer—an old tailor-made suit
doing duty as a pattern. “ And of such are some
Governmentouse habitues,” adds the poor seam-
stress.
The well-trained pupils of Cleveland-street
School performed in the Town Hall last week
before the crowned heads of Sydney in aid of the
necessitous tuberculous of the future for whom the
new hospital is to be instituted. The paths of
learning in that school are pleasant ones; as a
grown-up I can only wonder when they find time
for the three It. s. The scholars sang part-songs
and danced intricate gavottes and practised with
bar, bells and single-sticks. The juvenile prima-
donna accompanied by a midget violinist, had
the self-possession of five-and-twenty and the
short frocks of fifteen. A silver-bell ballet, directed
by Professor Read, jangled satisfactorily. The
concert ended in a loyal outburst of song ; they
saved the Queen, blessed Albert Edward, and
the audience filed out with the comfortable feeling
that all Heaven nas been annexed by the British
Hempire and the Union Jack is flying aoove the
pearly gates.
The Y.M.C.A. hall was crammed on Wednes-
day evening of last week at an invitation concert
given by Mr. L. Asioh to his violin pupil, Miss
Minnie Gunn. The youthful fiddler played to
great applause, but she isn’t a very great gun, and
would lay her hearers out more effectively were
she to fire a little lower. Sarasate is a trifle be-
yond her in some passages. The audience were
cloaked and bonneted and had a far-away appear-
ance, as if they had come on a long ’bus journey
from Annandale and Leichhardt and other dis-
tant regions. *
A stl °rt time ago it was impossible to obtain a
copy of I want yer, me honey, ” the most popular
of all coon songs, but now Glen and Cos (bv
arrangement with the original publishers) are
issuing a fresh supply of the ditty, with a portrait
on the cover of poor little Sadie M'Donald, giving
R a pathetic interest. They also publish “ Their
Headsnestled Closer Together,” made a success
by My dear old friend, Chas. Go’fray,” as
Harry Rickards calls him.
Fashionable frockists often mourn the super-
fluous flesh of their clients. A neat fit is an hn-
possibuity on a mountainous matron, who snaps
at every chance of reducing bulk. A smart
woman in another city had all the Nicest fat
women envying her on account of the apparent
ease with which she threw off stone after stone in
weight in a few months, and wrested the secret

Prices didn’t run high enough to please the ar-
Gsts at the Society of Artists’ auction sale on
Thursday and Friday last. The buyers were
chiefly dealers and newly-married men anxious to
pick up some pretty things for the walls of their
villas. G. Lambert moked aoout the most satis-
fied man of all. b.d Long’s poetical fancies went
dirt-cheap at a guinea or two ; and even the news-
paper correspondence didn’t bring up F. Mahony’s
Centaurs to their adequate value. Brains are
going cheap in Sydney just now. The final day
of the show was given over to the students, who
hung their works on the walls, and the girls—clad
m flowing white- fluttered about classically with
light refreshments for the visitors. Some clever
caricatures in the tea-room were surrounded all
the afternoon ; and Mr. Hellings sang some comic-
songs which, strange to say, really were comic.
An Australian man, now at ’Ome for the
Jubilee, has kindly written me his impressions of
London spring fashions. A man’s descriptions of
millinery are always pathetic, but I gather that
hats are positively enormous. Blue is the favorite
tint, and it often glares in company with red or
yellow. So quiet tones are not “in ” for celebra-
tion headgear.
At a tea-party last week two ladies present wore
name-brooches—one had a small diamond inscrip-
tion giving the name of a waltz which she had
composed. Another vivacious, black-eyed girl
had the name of her musical effort in large-sized
gold lettering across her chest. The next com-
poseress, should call her waltz the “ Woolloo-
mooloo,” and then she could hang the name round
her neck, like one of the new-fashioned gold-
chains.
Shop-windows are still vacant of allurements in
the Way of jubilee mementoes destined to attract
coin from loyal pockets. Except for anew tie in
an aggressively unbecoming hue, labelled “royal
purple,” there is no gew-gaw exhibited as yet.
These loud puce bows can never suit any man of
any complexion. A dark visage would glower
above the crude tint like a thunder-cloud, and a
bibulous nose would shine, by contrast with the
tie, a bright petunia,
Every fact about the royal house of Brunswick
is disinterred in recent magazines and periodicals.
Somebody has padded out an article in a recent
picture paper about the “Queen’s Aunts,” and
there seems to be so little known about the numer-
ous daughters of George 111. that the baffled
authoress owns herself puzzled at the complete
oblivion which has overwhelmed them. She can
only immortalise the eldest by quoting Fanny
Burney against her as “ a shocking bad dresser ” ;
t' ie Princess Royal married a king of a sort, but
the other princesses were all secretly married to
equerries and lords-in-waiting, and the reader is
quite grateful to discover the fact, because it puts
some incident into their dull careers.
Who was it said that “ the English govern by
humbug and let everybody into the secret ”? Here
is the latest instance. A par. about the forth-
coming jubilee announces:
The Queen will head the procession in a carriage, in
which she will be seated in a sort of rocking chair, which
will enable her automatically to appear to return the
salutes of her faithful subjects. Her Majesty’s landau,
which will be used in the procession, is being gorgeously
redecorated in vermilion, pointed with gold, and rubber
tyres are to be added,
Victoria R. and I. will be borne m her gorgeous
landau, and her venerable body will be jerked
backwards and forwards by a hidden spring
as if she were a toy mandarin ; and this is to give
pleasure to her “ faithful subjects,” who have the
device carefully explained to them beforehand. It
W °i U , d u be less ehildi . sh - and Just as effective, to
publish press-notices in the “ friends-please-accept-
this-intimation ’ style, stating that no return
salutes would be given by H.M. on account of
oodily infirmity.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
‘ Alas for the ‘society folk caught napping!
ihat sudden and secretive withdrawal of the
v lsitors Book ’ from the Govt. House portal, ere
many of them took the trouble to call, was evi-
dently intended for a knock-out blow at the least
desirable ones. Scented notes of apology and
palaver, formal billets of explanation, letters of
excuse were penned in desperation to Lord Neville
when invitations for the ball were being issued
Ihe secretary, however, was adamant in refusing
to recognise such explanations of tardiness in a
matter of courtesy, and the more importunate
appealers are beginning to fear that they have
supped in Baradise for the last time.

now as to which is correct—“ Dovvager Lady

mand. By the way, can the word “ dowager ”be

as in Victoria, the right of dower is expressly
abolished? ■ ,

The Bulletin’s London correspondent. “Vis-
count Cranley, his eldest son, is employed in cut-
ting eyes out of haliotus shell for the hideous
figures in the carvings that decorate the wall and
roof ends of the house. The whare is to be a
museum for the many Maori curios and weapons
the earl has collected, and will include the pre-
sents made to his boy, Huia, by the chiefs of the
Ngatiahuia tribe on his reception into brother-
hood by them. Huia is a delicate-looking child of
six years, more like a pretty girl than a boy, with
long, flowing curls of light gold. Onslow is favorite
for next Governor-Generalship of India.”
The original manu-
scripts of several of
Kendall’s poems are at
present held by an old
Sydney lady to whom
it has been whispered
that MS. specimens of
Kendall’s work are pro-
bably of increasing
value. In consequence,
she has flouted quite a
number of would-be
purchasers.
Not long ago a
convicted prisoner, as-
tounded at the severity
of the sentence just
passed on him by
N.S.W. Judge Docker,
exclaimed, “ Why don’t
you hang me?” “I
can’t,” snapped the
genial Judge. The other
day an “ old hand,”
caught with the pro-
ceeds of a burglary in
his bag, handed to
J udge Docker a written
statement in which he
admitted that his char-
acter was a bad one,
and acknowledged that
he should consider him-
self lucky if he got off
with 10 years’ penal ser-
vitude. The J udge ob-
liged him at once: Ten years.
Rumors that David Syme is, by his jubilee
munificence, aiming at a peerage, give added vigor
to the following words of Francis Adams: —
Of all the types I have taken, he is far away the most
typical—the tall, coarse, strong-jawed, greedy, pushing,
talented man, with his secularised religion and his com-
mercialised democracy. ... If England can strike a bar-
gain with him, even something not unlike Imperial Federa-
tion may, despite everything, yet become a fact.
Noel Buxton, son of Governor Buxton
(S.A.), was recently inveighing to the leader of
Adelaide Hansard staff on the iniquity of the
Australian squatters in shooting down aboriginals
suspected of killing their cattle. “Well,” was
the reply, “ supposing the stories you have heard
are all true, it is not very long ago that in England
white men were hanged for stealing sheep, and,
after all, a bullock is worth more than a wether,
while a nigger, even in your eyes, is not quite so
valuable as an Englishman.” The subject then
changed.
Apropos of the proposal to raise a statue
to Baronet Clarke, The Bulletin moves that it
should be made absolutely illegal to erect in any
public place any graven image to any person until
20 years after his or her death. If enough
enthusiasm remains after 20 years, then there is
just a fair chance that the deceased deserved his
statue. This idea would give the late lamented
time to simmer down and find his true level in
history. When he is just gone he looks very large,
for the same reason which makes a penny, held
close to the eye, look bigger than Mount Kosciusko.
Twenty years later he has got into line with the
rest of the great caravan of the departed, and his
height can be better estimated.
Editor Bulletin, — Re literary obscenities.
In 1863 the Kapunda (S. A.) Northern Star, then
run by George Massey Allen (an impulsive Irish-
man ; an ex-soldier; a trenchant penman some-
what Thady O’Kaneish in style) published some
verses which, from the acrostical standpoint, were
grossly indecent. The paper had been got at by a
treacherous contributor. Allen, who was agin
Governments in general, had, for some good while
previously, been attacking Treasurer Reynolds
(“ Teapot Tommy ”) and his colleague Strang ways
in most truculent fashion. Yet, notwithstanding
the fact that Allen was persona ingratissima to
ministers and that Pharisaic goody-goodyism
eagerly urged the Attorney-General to prosecute,
Stow, to his credit, flatly refused to take a
mean advantage of an innocent offender. —J. S.,

‘ ‘ ‘ Doctors differ, ’ but electricians never
agree, and Marconi’s telegraphing without wires
has many rabid opponents and enthusiastic parti-
sans,” writes The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent. “ Professor Silvanus Thompson oonsiders
it merely the slightest improvement on the Herz
electric spark-generator across space, while Post-
office Preece is loud in the new system’s praise, and
will not let the Italian boy, Marconi, leave his
side. The writer, after thirteen years’ electrical
experience, sides with Preece, and from what he
saw the instrument do believes it will revolutionise
telegraphy. Wealthy syndicates are offering the
inventor big sums for the English rights, much to
the annoyance of the War and Admiralty offices,
a committee from which including “ Tor
pedo ” Brennan —saw and was conquered by the
scheme’s possibilities. Briefly, electrical waves
generated by an induction coil are directed—as
the rays of a searchlight are—at a ‘ receiver ’ seven

graph ‘ sounder ’ and signal messages by means of
dot and dash ’ combinations.”

The O’Malley, M.P., during the S.A.
recess has been absent in the Forrest country in-
suring the lives of typhoid-threatened miners.
The first heard of him for months was contained
in a telegram from Coolgardie during May ad-
dressed : “ Brother Wilton, chief of Advertiser
staff, Adelaide.” It cost 35., and it ran thus:
“Unable comprehend why terrible earthquake
allowed to occur during my absence. Will ques-
tion Government early date.”
The rumor stood awhile that Q. Govt,
meteorologist Wragge wanted to go with the well
advertised, self-advertised Borchegrevink on a
South Polar expedition. Wragge denied it at
long last in the Brisbane dailies, and said he would
like to go if the Royal Geographical Society of
Britain wanted him to go, and' if the Q. Govt,
thought that it would be of public advantage that
he should go. Whereupon Borchegrevink, Esq.,
dips his pen in gibes and writes to Brisbane
Courier :
Both Mr. Wragge’s age, physique, and the fact that he
for years has lived entirely in Queensland, and that, as
far as I know, is unable to run on snowshoes, would, “in
my opinion, render him quite unfit for service on my
staff.
On Borchegrevink’s “staff” ! Now, who is this
man Borchegrevink ? And what is the value x>f
any credential of his, not self-given ?
“ Advocatus ” writes :
Ed. Bulletin,—You lately printed an item which may
well bear elucidation. As I was concerned in the last
official act of the drama, I think it only fair to expand
your par. The name of “W.,” the hero, was Wheeler:
he was an inspector, or sub-inspector, of native police.
He had frequently been annoyed by gins being brought
into the native-police camp. He threatened to flog the
next gin he caught in camp. He caught one. He dele-
gated the flogging to the troopers. You know what
bloodthirsty brutes they are. She was flovged, with
stirrup-straps, and died_ of her flogging. TFie matter
leaked Out, and the Aborigines Protection Society of tjie
day (early fn the Seventies, of even help re) clamored for''
Wheeler’s life. He was duly attested and'cohmiittedlor
trial, and the only available witness theh (a white man,
the sergeant under Wheeler) was bound over to give evi-
dence against him. Application was made in Brisbane
(Wheeler had been committed in Rockhampton) to the
late Judge Lutwyehe for bail, and the Judge allowed it,
Wheeler himself in a large sum (Supreme Court Judges
always open their mouths wide) and two sureties of t lltOG
each. The late Billy Pattison and Captain Hunter, of
Rockhampton, became bondsmen. At that time the Cir-
cuit Court sat in Rockhampton at very long intervals.
While out on bail, Wheeler came into considerable money.
He is said to have paid each of his bondsmen the £lOOO
bail and then “ cleared.” He made for Italy, and when I
came into the matter he was living among the Sabine hills
near Rome, across the Campagna, on the farm, or near the
farm, which tradition still points out as the farm of
Horace, the Latin poet. In due course the Judge came
up on Circuit; the case “Regina r. Wheeler ” was duly
called on —and, of course, there was “no appearance,
your Honor.” Application made by Mr. Attorney to
have the bail “ estreated.’ Billy Pattison and Captain
Hunter called up; each “shelled out” with apparently
long faces. For years the farce was kept up. Every
Circuit Court saw the repetition of the comedy. In 1879
(or 1889) the then Attorney-General Pring entered bv me
a nolle-prosequi on the first Circuit of the late Mr. Justice
Harding, of happy memory. *
Another correspondent:—
There has been at least one other case where bail has
been accepted in Queensland on a capital charge— viz.,
that of the landlord of a Normanton hotel, charged with
murdering a blackboy with a swingle-bar. Accused was
found not guilty by a Cooktown jury, but the expense of
the trial ruined him. By the way, “Wheeler”—an
assumed name—was seen and recognised by some Broad-
sound residents in England two or three years ago.

pointed “ professional ”) per-
sists in circulating the
falsehood that the A.N.A.
literary competitions were
“open to amateurs only,”
and the par. has got round
to you. As a matter of fact
the competitions were open
to all, and of the 22 who
tried for the “ Essay on

prize, there were included
several so-called “ profes-
sionals,” while J. S. Jones,
winner of the “History”
prize, is on the Argus staff.

An extremely significant portion of the
prayer or anthem or something said aloud by the
whole congregation at St. Paul’s, at the Clarke

adversity.

this part of the service, “ Prayer on the death of

THE LATE [?]W. J. CLARKE.
THE PROPOSED STATUE.
The Bishop of'Melbourne (Dr. Goe), in
seconding the resolution, said that while, as
a general princqde, he approved of the erec-
tion of memorials to great men, such a re-
cognition was specially needed in the case of
a young country, where a rising generation
was growing up without the advantages of
those ancient buildings and monuments
which inspired in young people a desire to
what history had to teach about the
jtokt, and to become acquainted with the
character and services of those who deserved
well .of their country.
“Comm&ndant” Booth was not so sure
about that. They would find a way to*
override the prison rules to good advantage.
He had sufficient confidence.in his officers
for that, for some of them knew their way
inside of Pentridge as well as outside.
(Laughter.) If they were able to get al
these men in their cells, say a month be
fore they came out, the Government would
be relieved of many undesirable citizens,
whom they had now to keep almost con-
stantly at great expense to the state.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The notorious (N.S.W.) Suffieldcase is on
its way for another Parliamentary "airing. Will
Minister Gould gag enquiry yet again?.
If rumor speaks truly, there will be a
phenomenal distribution of “honors” in connec-
tion with the Diamond Jubilee. A cheap way of
rewarding and purchasing loyalty to the throne.
“ Gauds save the Queen ! ”
The failure of S.A. Labor-party to return
more than one of its candidates to the Leg. Coun-
cil leaves Fat. Man once more supreme. With an
“ absolute majority ” required to pass the extension
of the Council franchise, that reform is as far off
es ever.
It will be interesting to notice whether
the Privy Council will betray the same reluctance
to review the N.S.W. conviction in a late case
where the right of betting is involved, as it
always shows in appeals against convictions where
life is involved.
The doddering Vic. Law Commission is to
hybernate for a month or two before starting
work. A pity Higgins didn’t vacate the chair-
manship when he saw its rickety constitution. It
can only delay law reform and disgust people with
attempts thereat. (
N.S.W. Attorney-General Want adopts
most gracious and conciliatory language in official
and other communications with two or three dis-
tricts that return Opposition members. So sudden
and marked is the change of style that enemies
scent “ Jack ”on a near election tour. King Jack
wishes he were in the Assembly, to break the back
of Federation.
Wallace Nelson, tilting at the Brisbane
(Q.) Worker crowd, and those Labor-members
who scream for “ solidarity ” : “ The ‘ stupids ’ of
a party have no difficulty in maintaining absolute
unanimity. People who never think run no risk
of thinki.-.g differently. There are many ways of
doing something, but there is only one way of
doing nothing successfully.”
Q. Acting-Premier Tozer’s latest insinua-
tion is that the attitude of Nevermind Nelson and
his colleagues towards Australian Federation was
“guided by a desire for the help of their own
colony in the first instance, and, secondly, of Aus-
tralia as a nation.” Cunning dog, Towzer ! He
didn’t put it boldly as an explanation, but intro-
duced it suggestively as an innuendo.
Dear Bulletin, — I hear that, in order to
frove beyond doubt that N.S.W. is a whole-hog
'reetrade country, and is ready to pawn its
wisdom-teeth in the glorious cause of Australian
Federation, daddy Brunker—the Premier’s locum
tenens— is going to have the cornstalk unemployed
registered, so that the likes of us can’t come down
and sell our muscle in a free market.—Leperland
U NEMPLOYED.
Talmage predicted that Greece would cer-
tainly triumph, “because she is a Christian nation,
and has her quarrel just.” Tacitus (plagiarised by
Napoleon) said that Heaven always sides with the
strongest legions, and Tacitus has “ got there ”
again. Talmage’s mouth always was too wide;
but perhaps the reason why the Deity didn’t
respectfully adopt De Witt’s suggestion was that
Greek Christianity is like Talmage himself —“full
of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”
The death of old David Coutts left a
vacancy in the Vic. House of 48 Rich Landlords,
and it almost looked as if there was going to be a
fight for the seat, but the second man retired from
the contest, owing to a cold in the head or some-
thing, and the usual dreary walk-over resulted.
If only some Government would attach a salary of
£5OO a-year to each M.L.C.-ship, so that live men
would hustle each other for the billets, and thereby
arouse public interest in the matter, it would be
the beginning of better things.
“ Paddy ” Glynn, who beat labor-nominee
Buttery in the recent S.A. bye-election for North
Adelaide, is the most patient politician S.A. has
known. He was elected in ’B7 to S.A. Assembly,
and since then has been defeated four times, and
elected twice to different seats. He is an able poli-
tician and brilliant litterateur, and wiped off an
old score with the Labor-party, which had the
bad judgment to run a nominee against the man
who did more than any other two S.A. politicians
to secure the present system of land-values taxa-
tion.
In Maoriland the practice of charging
municipal rates on unimproved land values is
spreading. The advantage of it is that, if two
men have each a JvIOOO allotment, the man who
has a big, solid stone building on his bit of ground
pays no more than the man who has a ramshackle
wooden hovel let to ladies of loose character.
Therefore, the man who puts up a fine structure
isn’t penalised for improving the town, and the
owner of the hovel is furnished with a good reason
for pulling down that eyesore and putting up
something better in its place.
Hain, late of Vic. Tele-
graph department, said to have
been behind the late P.O. en-
quiry, is now leader-writer for the
Age, and is being persistently an-
nounced as a candidate for
Frank Madden’s seat in the As-
sembly. Frank will probably get
in, as there is another good man
in the field—Beckett, a young
lawyer, president of a council out
that way.
R. S. Guthrie, at whose in-
stance the Absent Voters’ Act
was placed on S.A. Statute-book,
did not benefit nearly as much by
its provisions as did his two chief
opponents in the late contest.
Premier Kingston was also a pro-
minent supporter of this measure,
but on being asked at the mail
steamer’s side if he had filled in
an absent voter’s form he replied,
“By Jove, no; I clean forgot,”
and appeared to be much annoyed
at his remissness.
The practice, indulged in
by two Vic. Judges lately in the
cases of Quinn and Phillips, of
asking the jury questions with a
view to the “mercy ” "jurisdic-
tion of the Executive afterwards,
is, if not strictly legal, one worthy
of being sanctioned and would
probably work gradually, with
the education of the community
from which the jurors are drawn,
in the direction of the abolition
of capital punishment. Under
this system the sentence is prac-
tically fixed by the jury.
Q. “ Railways ” Dickson,
the Pecksniff of the Nevermind
Govt. : “ Er, as a private member,
er, I have been called upon, er,
to criticise some of the, er, ac-
tions of the, er, Ministry in the
past ; but, er, I have, er, joined
them since on, er, an honorable
invitation and, er, acceptance —
yes, er, acceptance ; and, er,
upon, er, deliberate reflection, I,
er, am convinced, er, that, er, the
Ministry, with, er, the exception
of myself—yes, er, of myself—
possesses, er, the ablest men sit-
ting, er, in Parliament —yes, er,
the ablest.”
Now talk of summoning another “Imperial
Conference ” in London, to nobble the visiting
Australians and ethers as Griffith and Co. were
nobbled in ’B7. That Conference spawned the
Naval Defence Act, with ships (nominally) tied to
Australian waters ; at the next, it will be sought
to break even the nominal tie, and tax Australians
for the British fleet generally. Also, Britain badly
wants a Customs preference for her decadent
manufactures, in return for moonshine about
“ the Flag ” and “ the Empire ! ”

Duncan Gillies, who has faded out of
notice since his return to Victoria, will, it is said,
stand for Barwon at next general election. Levien,
of Mildura fame, finding that the Barwon seat is
slipping away from him, may possibly retire (al-
though he denies the rumor) in Duncan’s favor.

Great is the jubilation in the camp of
Capital over the Glassey oration in Rockhampton.
To hear the man, who was once a thorn in the
flesh of the Boodlewraith, merely slurring over the
iniquities that once made his blood boil was indeed
joy. To hear him confess with the utmost naivete
that he was an aspirant for office ; to note the
almost fraternal tone of his allusions to Nelson,
Tozer and co.; to be able to twit him with the
change and its all too patent reasons—was bliss
indeed.
The usual 24th -of - May
leader in the Age was this year
devoutly loyal, with the smug,
placid, oily loyalty of the fat
Jingo to whom loyalty is a re-
ligion and the monarchical in-
stitution is the highest effort
of gods and men. Hitherto,
David has been wont to speak
of the monarchy as a thing that
would possibly be smothered in
the course of 10,000 years or so,
but now he has no doubts, and
his one fear is expressed in the
piteous moan : “ What if the
Queen should die? ” David may
congratulate himself in the words
of the Wesleyan hymn, “I know
my title’s sure.” Possibly,
though, the Age man perceives
that a title is a valuable thing to
refuse.
Coleraine (Vic.) Board of
Advice has resolved to give
copies of Parson Fitchett’s gory
“ Deeds that ' A on the Empire”
to the senior scholars in the local
state schools, as a means of cele-
brating the record reign. This
is a piece of crass effrontery on
the part of the Board, which
“ Siniler ” Peacock should look
into. Only very mild, specally-
prepared history is permitted to
be taught in Vic. state schools,
the object being to keep off the
corns of all parties. Fitchett’s
blood-and-thunder chronicles are
furiously and strenuously parti-
san, their purpose being to show
that nothing is impossible to
Cod when Old England is on His
side. As history, they are fanati-
cally fictional ; as literature,
they are a cut above “ Black
Jack, or the Rover of the
Rockies. ” They only please the
sort of man who deliberately
reads the Bible to his innocent
children.
Figured out that at last
M.L. general election 76’44 per
cent, of the women electors voted
as against 75'90 of the men.
But there was a big drop all the
same, for the women percentage
in 1893 was 8518 per cent.
Will some member of N.S.W. Assembly
ask the Minister of Justice to ascertain why Dis-
trict Court Judge Gibson recently sentenced a
man to three years’ hard labor (carrying with it
nine months’ solitary confinement) for stealing a
tin of baking-powder of the value of ninepence ?
According to the evidence of the local
Inspector of'Charities, given before the Old-Age
Pension Commission, one Melbournian out of
every 70 is in poverty, while m London the poor
are five times as numerous—one in 14. ihe disas-
trous effects of Protection again, no doubt.
A prominent N.S.W. Parliamentarian,
hitherto a staunch supporter of Bung, promised
last week that he will vote for a Prohibition Bill
if such a measure come before the House. “I
would exert my influence to carry the Bill,” he
said “ with the hope of thereby ending the career
of those living on the so-called temperance game.”
Salvation Army Booth, giving evidence
before the Vic. Old Age Pension Commission :
“ We find that nine-tenths of the people who come
to the Army for help are willing to work.” Which
is the straightest possible answer to the comfort-
able lie that the unemployed are mostly people
who don’t want employment.
A D. Telegraph correspordent, re Sydney
North Shore bridge: “Your wise suggestion to
have the undertaking carried out by private enter-
prise will meet with general approval. Private
enterprise has already constructed both a bridge
and tunnel at New York.” The only New York
bridge which has any bearing on the case is that
connecting the city with Brooklyn, and private
enterprise certainly didn’t build that. It was con-
structed and made a profitable speculation by the
municipality after private enterprise had refused
to tackle it. And the time will assuredly come
when Sydney will be darned sorry that it didn’t
do likewise.
S.A. Leg. Council elections, which re-
sulted in the strengthening of the conservative
vote by one, should be a lesson to the democratic
party. A victory for liberalism was considered a
certainty, with the result that a vast majority of
the workers did not trouble to vote, and in the
Central district, the labor stronghold, Tomkinson,
boss S.A. Tory, romped in by about 300 votes,
while in the south Kirkpatrick also was de-
feated. The National Ass crowd won the day in
the south by diplomatically running a moderate
liberal and thus scooping the votes of the pro-
ducers. Similarly, in N. Adelaide Assembly
election the Tories voted for Glynn (a moderate
liberal) in preference to running a hard-shell Tory
and courting certain defeat.
The N.S.W. Government having definitely
refused to move about the North Shore (Sydney)
bridge or tunnel, it would seem that “private
enterprise ” will get hold of the job after all.
Also, it is probable it will fix the matter this
session. Meanwhile, the Government is going to
spend more big sums on scrub-cutting, or sand-
shifting, or digging big holes and filling them up
again, or moving some other white elephant
around, in order to keep the unemployed more or
less quiet during the winter. Why not start the
North Shore tunnel as a relief work ? It would,
at least, yield a better return than the scrub-
cutting job. The objection raised is that it isn’t
certain to pay interest on its cost. But the
ordinary relief works are certain not to pay
interest on their cost.
Melbourne Age is against Federal railway
control because “ local interests would be liable to
be sacrificed ” and “ a Federal Parliament might
prove wanting in sympathy and knowledge on
these matters.” Victoria is the smallest province
in Australia, and it has the biggest railway system
in Australia. In proportion to its area it has four
times as much railway as N.S.W. and ten times
as much as Queensland. Yet the local Parlia-
ment had so little “ knowledge of these matters ”
that almost the whole of this immense system is
crowded into the centre of the little province, and
the rest of the country is left a blank. About one-
half Victoria can’t make its railways pay because
there is far too much line for the area, and the
other half gets its produce to market per bullock-
dray. If the Federal Government could make a
worse mess of things than the local one has done
its ingenuity must be appalling.

WATSON’S WHISKY.
Events in the year 1897.
There are always plenty of alarmists ready to
annually predict calamities, but happily very often
their prophecies are founded on the imprudent,
inexact and misunderstood scientific reports. The
events which interest us individually, each hearth-
stone, every home, are those that bear upon the
welfare and health of the family circle. The
greatest event to us, then, is the recovery of a dear
one from dangerous illness: and we have had
pleasure in recording many such events in these
columns from time to time during the year. Many
Australians gladly tell how the health returned—
happiness came back—how the world seemed
bright again, which to them was the greatest and
most important event of the year. Mr. George F.
Vaxey, Okura, Auckland, in his joy over recovery,
writes a letter that comes from, and appeals to,
the heart. He writes : “About four years ago,
I was taken ill with Bright’s Disease of the kid-
neys, and was in the hospital for a month, and
had been bad ever since—on and off. This month
I was laid up very bad with it. Living in the
country where no doctors were handy, I took it
into my head (and it was aching all the time) to
try Warner’s ‘ Safe ’ Cure. After four doses I
began to improve. In three days I was able to
get out of bed. I have taken six bottles, and am
better now than I have been since first attacked.
Am still taking it; and feel sure it will make a
permanent cure. ” The nation’s welfare is the in-
dividual’s welfare. The nation’s pulse is yours
and mine.. Past events prove the value and wis-
doni of being guided by such indisputable facts.*

That one story is good until another is told
,is again shown by the fading away of applicant’s
affidavits in the case Ray v. Crick and Kiely
(wherein N.B.W. Full Court was asked to “ deal
with ” the well-known Sydney solicitor and M.P.
and a professional associate of his, for certain
alleged malpractices), immediately the respondent’s
affidavits were submitted to the Court. Crick has
made a beautiful crop of political and legal
enemies, who would rejoice in his disgrace and
downfall, and are much chagrined at what the
Full Court regarded as his complete vindication
Apropos, the fact that the Law Institute didn’t take
up the case against Crick made it pretty clear in
advance that there was nothing in it.
Stock Report.—Pitt, Son and Badgery,
Ltd., report heavy supplies of cattle and sheep for
the month. A\ ith the latter, much inconvenience
has been caused through want of sufficient class-
ing and yarding room. Our ample drafting yards
with extensive accommodation for watering, &c.’
adjoining the sale-yards, have enabled our experts
to handle all consignments carefully and punctu-
ally, ensuring most satisfactory results. We have
sold through the yards during the month 4092
cattle, and 79894 sheep and lambs. Calf and pig
sales at the City yards have also been extensive
and satisfactory.*
After 3£ years’ litigation and 21 separate
appearances in court, the cases arising out of the
loss of the Alert off the Victorian coast are at last
settled. Two appeals to the Privy Council and
one new trial in the local courts (with more pos-
sible appeals to follow it) were still pending, so
the case might easily have lasted for another year
or two, but the defendant co. suddenly grew weary
and made a compromise. Therefore the Alert
cases are not quite such horrible examples of the
law's delay as they might be ; they only show that
a wealthy defendant can deny justice to an impe-
pecunious plaintiff for three years or so, whereas
if they had been followed out to the bitter end
they might have shown instead that he could do
more hVe yearS ° r more ~P erha P s a good deal

The Maoriland “religious” organs were

they saw no impropriety in incontinently hanging

-Re the Westralian cattle-boats : One of
them which left Newcastle (N.S. W.) a few weeks
back encountered very heavy weather crossing the
Btght and as the seas began to come aboard the
holds had to be shut down ; result—7o odd bul-
locks smothered. The whole of the bullocks of an-
other steamer stampeded whilst rounding Nobby’s
in the late S.E. gale ; the caretakers were unable
to stop the rush, as the cattle had become fairly
mad. When the next port was reached all the
bullocks were either dead or dying. Another
cattle-boat, a few months back, lost 200 out of 400
head in the Bight through rough weather. 1570
bullocks and 5840 sheep left Newcastle for Kre-
mantle during the last month, besides 170 stud
bulls (Durhams) for Cambridge Gulf; 210 bul-
locks and only 160 sheep were lost.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The N.S.W. Full Court decision declaring cash-
betting on racecourses illegal is a serious blow, not only
to bookies, but to the racing clubs. The public won’t
turn up unless they can have their little bit on, and clubs
live on gate-money. There seems nothing better for it
than to hold a church or a charity bazaar at every race-
meeting, and have a totalisator —10 per cent, for expenses
and 10 per cent, for the charity. Some church or charity
might lend its name in consideration of a share of the
spoil—or why not start at once a Home for Destitute and
Decayed Bookmakers, and run race-course bazaars in
aid ? The public would stand 20 per cent, in considera-
tion of the better prices, and that percentage would keep
a good few bookies from starvation till better (cash-better)
times return.

Despite the harassment of members by the
police, Tatt’s Club, Sydney, brought off a very successful
meeting at Randwick last Saturday. The two-year-olds
were in strong force in the Flying Handicap, filling the
first three places. The winner Kilt —he cut out the six
furlongs in lm. 54?4sec. with Bst. 51b. —improves every
time he runs, and is not far removed from the top of the
tree. The country horse Martineer (Padlock-Restless)
showed up well, and will win a race before long. In the
Winter Stakes, Projectile ran strongly with his heavy
burden, but was unable to give winner Messmate a stone.
Vanitas ran gamely enough, but he is getting stale and
needs rest. The well-bred, but hitherto moderate per-
former, Silvertone (Marvellous-Silver Bell), easily won
Tatt’s Stakes. Of the Welter Handicap candidates, Kelso,
Euglo and Sovereign may be expected to be returned
winners ere the close of the season.

Christchurch (M.L.), with a population of
45,000, drawing on Maoriland’s scattered population of
750,000, gives £6660 in stakes at its chief meeting, an
average of £2220 per day. Sydney (A. J.C.), with a popu-
lation of 350,000 drawing on the Australian population of
8,000,000, gives at its chief meeting £9lOO in stakes, an
average of £55 per diem more than Christchurch.
Christchurch has eight days racing in the year and gives
£13,110 in stakes. Before Christchurch had the totalisa-
tor its stakes were under £2OOO per annum. The machines
are operated by the club sec., and, so far, have cost 10s. 6d.
and4-10thsof apennypercent. to work. Thegatesand cards
are also managed by the club, secretary Wanklyn being a
firm believer in standing the profit or loss on everything
that can be worked by the club’s officials. The profits of
the totalisator go to the proper persons, viz., “ the
owners.” If the A.J.C. had the totalisator and put
through three times as much as Christchurch does, viz.,
£260,000, they could add £25,000 a year to their stakes.

Tattersall Adams is being strongly urged to
draw his sweeps after the races are run, to checkmate
horse-owners’ blackmail. On the face of it this looks like
a good move, but it must not be forgotten that drawing
after the race would prevent the holder of a horse from
hedging. It is not the “ rat ” owners who are keenest
after the sweep-money. At least two of the wealthiest
men in N.S. Wales insist upon their bit, and a big bit,
too, to nothing.

Died at Bathurst last week, the stallion Forest
King, by Maribyrnong from Xarifa. What a memory the
names of Maribyrnong and Xarifa bring up in horse-
racing and yachting old-timers ! Maribyrnong it was who
sired such classic winners as Miss Jessie, Richmond, Wood-
lands, Bargo, Hamlet, Cap-a-pie, Bosworth, and countless
other good ones, and who, when mated with the Panic
mare The Fawn, proved such “ a nick ” that the progeny,
year after year, used to be started at a thousand
when put up for sale as yearlings. Xarifa was also the
name of a celebrated Sydney yacht in the sixties. Dan
Sheehy, of Woolloomooloo Bay, saw one of his boys sail-
ing a model formed by the section of the head of a cask,
and was so struck with the idea that he built the Xarifa,
on similar lines, to the order of Mr. Parbury. She proved
a great success, and afterwards went to the Islands as the
State vessel of King Thackambau. Mr. Dangar owned
her only rival, the handsome Mistral, and the many duels
fought between the pair are green in the memories of
Sydney old-timers.

The London Stock Exchange proverb, “Good
information and cheap money will ruin anyone,” is just
as paradoxically true of a kindred branch of gambling.
See the latest two examples of how the Jugginses, who
easily and cheaply came into fortunes accumulated by
miserly relatives, squander it backing “ good informa-
tion ” obtained direct from the stable.

At the V.R.C. meeting, last week, punters got
another lesson re the danger of attaching too much im-
portance to the effort of a horse that “ makes up a lot of
ground at the finish” without troubling the winner.
Canoona, in the Bay View Handicap at Williamstown,
had put in one of these abortive rushes. Trent was
winning with ridiculous ease when the mare, coming fast
from the rear of the field, seemed to be “ rapidly over-
hauling the leader.” Two days later, in the V.R.C.
Birthday Handicap, mare Canoona met Trent on 161 b.
better terms, and was made favorite, but again Trent won
easily, whilst Canoona this time remained in the rear
from start to finish. Trent—by Trenton-Sumatra —has
been whispered of lately as a rod in pickle, and consider-
ing that the black gelding pulled off three nice little
handicap races within 48 hours the “whisper” should be
worth further attention.
* • * *
Adelaide Birthday meeting brought big divi-
dends and much joy to the bookmakers, for big dividends
mean outsiders. Eleusinian, who won the cup, belongs
to David James of Auraria Melb. Cup fame, and the
owner made a big haul with a dividend on the machine
alone of £26 odd. The favorite, Acton, was nowhere ;
in fact, the Melb. crowd lost much money at the meeting.
David James has now won a Melb. Cup, Australian Cup,
and AS. A. Birthday Cup—a good record. But a win for
James always means disaster for the public, who never
know about his good things.
* * * *
Eleusinian paid a ,£26 18s. dividend in the
Adelaide Birthday Cup, and yet there were only six dis-
tinctly better favorites running for that important race.
For the same event, run at Flemington or Randwick, the
winner would have been certainly not more than a 14 to 1
chance.
* * * *
Horseflesh is cheap in Bananaland. In illustra-
tion whereof a Bundaberg paper tells how a local newsboy
received £1 from his dad to buy a horse with. Such
beastly extravagance disgusted the boy. To give his
father a lesson in economy, the youth spent a morning at
the sale-yard studying the cattle, and finally came home
leading three horses and with half-a-crown change in his
pocket. And one animal turned out quite a passable hack
into the bargain.

—“ in connection with big events in Sydney have lately
been common enough to almost pass without comment,”
remarks Melb. Arcus. The Sydney public, surely, must
be getting very sick of surprises. Never a first or second
favorite got home in either of the five events at Rand-
wick on the “ Glorious 24th,” and two of the winners were
very rank outsiders.

Key’s victory in the Royal Handicap at Flem-
ington, the other Monday, was the first instance—as far
as the writer can remember —of a two-year-old winning an
all-aged race under top weight. Key carried 61b. more
than ancient Babel, and 341 b. more than four-year-old
Canal, who finished third.

They say that Albert Miller is the sporting head
of the anti-tote party in Melbourne. He reckons that the
Redleap stable’s reputation for straight-going would
deprive them of all chance of getting decent odds about
their jumpers from the machine, whereas under the Ikey
Mo system a commission may be worked before the public
get to know which of the Miller’s little lot (for big races)
is the fancy one. Therefore, astute Albert has the wel-
fare of Alf. Josephs and Co. at heart. Brother Septimus,
on the other hand, is disposed to think that the tote, plus
a few bookmakers laying tote odds, would be a desirable
change. The stable to invest its money with the “books,”
of course, instead of helping to diminish the machine’s
dividend.

Donald Wallace has an improving filly in Moon-
lyong, who may perhaps do a good turn for the old Car-
bine colors next season.

The inglorious death of Rudolph from thirst in
the far-back drought country in S.A., recalls the fact that
he and his stable companions, Dreadnought, Singapore,
Sinecure, &c , with one exception, did no good after the
Kirkham break-up. Had Mr. White lived, these horses
would probably have still kept on winning. How is it
that in other hands they failed to catch the judge’s eye ?
Change of quarters, training, &c., may account for a
little, but not for all. A Sheffield ped. once explained to
the writer how the “gaffer” system interfered with a
runner’s record in public. He could get “ fit ” time after
time, and be repeatedly ordered to stand down for betting
considerations, so that when his turn came to “jig” at
last he might have become stale through overtraining,
or so disgusted as to have ceased persevering. A man in-
dependent of gafferdom could try every time he felt “ fit.”
Though the owner of Kirkham did not study the public,
who often backed one string while the stable won with
another, still he always meant to get home first, and, con-
consequently, a horse, when in the trainer’s opinion “ the
psychological moment had arrived,” got a loose head and
every chance, as far as condition went, &c., of catching
the judge’s eye. Through market considerations and the
accompanying shilly-shallying, the reputation of many a
Carbine and Abercorn has been ingloriously buried in
the “ bag.”
* * * »
Utter was the only one of White’s lot to do any
good on the turf after the Kirkham break-up. She fell
into the hands of another owner, who sent her to win
every time she was fit and well, instead of vainly waiting
for a better market. It is a remarkable fact that Oxen-
ham, who, as a bookmaker, admittedly lives on the game,
has been a thousand times straighter as an owner than
nine-tenths of the “gentlemen of position” and commercial
magnates who profess to race for pleasure only instead of
profit.

At Melbourne, last Saturday, the N.S.W. horse
His Grace won a hurdle race, starting at 6to 4. With the
fairly light impost he is likely to get in Grand National,
he should be dangerous, though he will have a tough cus-
tomer to meet in his compatriot, Jack Hanwell.
* * • *
The A. J.O. holds a one-day’s meeting at Rand-
wick to-day (Sat.), when Favor and Faber will once more
meet over hurdles. The former should win the rubber,
but he will find a dangerous opponent in ASolus. The
Exeter Stakes should lie between Aurea, Syerla, King
Clovis, Mutineer and Glendennon, and perhaps the
mysterious Aurea may be returned winner. Now Glad-
stone has been schooled to face the sodwall, he should
have no difficulty in winning the steeplechase. “ Sweep-
money considerations ” will make a big field for the Elles-
mere Stakes. True Blue, Kallatina, Kelso, or Hordern’s
selected (probably Rebel Queen) should win, and, “ on
paper,” the former has the appearance of a good thing.
The High-weight Handicap may fall to Sovereign, whose
most dangerous opponents appear to be Euglo and Tri
chord. * * •
On the concluding day of the A.R.C. meeting,
Chevalier made amends for his Birthday Cup deb
easily winning: the Aldermans Cup, pacing acrain
dividend of £2 16s. The very unlucky Response
finished in a place. Staffa, the unreliable, a Plumed
non-stayer, easily won a mile race pa V
ing the nice dividend of £8 Is. n the Steeplechase tne
N.S. Waler, Bernal, fell, and jockey Ellis was hurt.

pensive item. * * *
That good, but unlucky, horse, True Blue
(Hotchkiss-Rose of Wellington), was subniitted to aucUon
last week, but was “passed in when tmday
600 gs. Should he pull through at Randwick to day
(Saturday) his owner’s policy, at present much ques
tioned, will prove to have been correct, though 600 gs isa
tempting offer for anything in the horseflesh line just now.
The Ascot Cup, at ’Ome, will be worth 4000 sovs.
this year, and a very exciting and heavy betting.™d t o
anticipated. The “ swells ” and the public will stand to
the Prince of Wales’ Derby winner. Persimmon whilst
the heavy bettors connected with YVinkfield s l r,de
go nap on that first-rate handicap horse. Lord Rosebery,
Mrs. Langtry, and the French sportsmen, Abeille and

Battalion dead-heated Archie’s Daughter over a mile and
a-quarter, giving her no less than 291 b., and yet a
minutes after the mare gave the doughty gelding 21b. an
beat him by a neck over a mile and a distance, inis was,
indeed, a most extraordinary reversal of form.

In sheer desperation for pictures, the Austral-
asian publishes photos, of the Inaugural Run of the
Harriers of Melb. district. The alleged harriers, dressed
in a cobweb and a flushed expression, afforded a moving
si°-ht for their sisters and cousins and aunts as they pot-
tered along the roads of Malvern, every jaw solemnly pro-
vided with its plug of chewing-gum. Harriers and cyclists
justify the national name of “gum-suckers.’ A miscel-
laneous lot of boys with little more than loin-cloths upon
them is a cheerless sight. They do not attain within one
million miles of the dignity of nudity—they are simply
naked little chaps going to be washed by nurse, and very
nervous about the result. Naturally, a large number of
charming young ladies crowded to watch the performance.
The M.L. golf championship has been won by
Pride, of Wellington. In the final round he beat Ross
Gore, also of Wellington, by 4 up and 2 to play. Gore
made a game struggle, especially considering he is practi-
cally a new hand at the game. Among the prominent
players was Arthur Duncan, a youngster of 21, who has
given up football, cricket, and tennis —in all of which he
was proficient —for the sake of this latest fad of hockey on
crutches.

At least one Australian boxer is said to have
earned more money than Fitzsimmons. According to the
(London) Spectator, this was shown in a practical manner
three years ago, when the “ boxing kangaroo ” was in the
height of his fame. This animal was said to have earned
£20,000 in 12 months ; anyhow, it was admitted at the
Roval Aquarium that he had “ made more money ” than
any other animal—more even than the most celebrated
racehorses had earned, whether in training or after.
* * * *
Ed. Bulletin, —Be the Corbett-Fitzsimmons
fight, Corbett certainly had the best of it until the end of
the 7th round, and even after that date landed most of
the blows; but there couldn't have been much ginger in
them, or Fitz wouldn’t have come up so fresh after each
round, and you mustn’t forget that Fitz connected occa-
sionally. Hall also out-pointed Fitzsimmons in their second
fight, but, all the same, like Corbett’s, his cake was
dough. As for Corbett downing Fitz after the fight, that
is easily explained. Fitz was off his guard, probably re-
ceiving the congratulations of his excited friends. On
the other hand, Fitz had all the best of what roughing
took place in the fight, though this was supposed to be
Corbett’s strongest pointnext to his cleverness. Naughton’s
remark at end of the 10th round, that “Jim’s gone,”
about sums the fight up ; after that Fitz had a winning
hit left. Corbett appears to have been devoid of one.—
J.B.
* * * •
Touching the Fitzsimmons v. Corbett fight, thus
the Medical Press and Circular : “The deciding buffet
was evidently one administered over the celiac plexus,
called ‘ a blow on the heart,’ really on the stomach. The
referee described it as ‘an under-arm punch’ just below,
a to the right of, the heart, which is, being
fnferpreted the pitofthe stomach By the laws of the
interpretea, one . B y the rules of common
humanity however, it is a cowardly outrage little short of
a deliberate attempt at assassination. The fatal nature
of a severe blow to the network of visceral nerves, known
tVe ceUac plexus, makes such « punches as those which
finished Corbett among the most deadly that can be in-
Hnisnea t j,e way, what have the anti-
vivisfctionists to say to this brutality inflicted by man
upon man?J’ , * *
Where are the young fighters ? Corbett at 30
c-oes down before the red-headed Fitzsimmons of 35 A
few years ago and all the top-notch scrappers failed to
touch the quarter century. Corbett himself was chain-
rfion amateur of America at 18; Slavin fought Burke at
25 • Johnel Sullivan became world’s champion at 27, and
met his hardest nut in Mitchell just as the latter attained
his majority ; while Peter Jackson was a mere lad when
Farnan went down before him. To-day scarce one of the
first rankers is under 30. Of course a fighter who reaches
30 with an unimpaired constitution should be at his very
best in point of stamina, to say nothing of the advantage
accruing from experience. #
“ Retire Australia ! ’’—for once. San Francisco
Cali, sits down thus hard on the Australian baseballers.
«* The kangaroos are a jolly set of fellows, but they don t
begin to know how to play baseball, and the seriousness
with which they took their own efforts amused the spec-
tators as much as a three-ringed circus. They are butter-
fingered, can’t catch a little bit, and each player thinks
he r s got all he can attend to in looking after his own posi-
tion—in which he’s about right! ” And this, too, against
a local team “ who will never set the world afire with their
own playing.” “To what base uses,” &c.
The ’Frisco papers have attributed fearsome
slabs of skite to Harry Musgrove, manager of the Aus-
tralian Baseballers. Known in Australia as a shrewd man,
with a full appreciation of the advantages of saying little,
the Yankee press makes Musgrove assert that his team
left their home for the purpose of showing Americans
“ what baseball was.” “ You don’t know the game here,”
he is alleged to have told one imaginative scribe; “all
our boys are as good in one position on the field as an-
other, and we are just going to whip your baseballers off
their fields.” To anyone who knows Musgrove, the yarn
carries its own refutation.

The professional cyclists turned up in force at
St. Hilda, on Saturday, to battle for tinpot trophies. The
meeting was a benefit for Have Kirk, whose spine was
dislocated while training last Nov. All the cracks took
the field, the big race of the day, five miles scratch, fall-
ing to Walne, a wheel ahead of Ken Lewis. Green, the
Englishman, had a cut at the flying start quarter, paced,
but failed to do better than 24 4-5. Walne established an
unpaced quarter in 27 dead, which will take beating.
Kirk, who nets about .£3O from the affair,
was a most unlucky cyclist. A rider of top rank,
he never won a decent race, for he fell every
time he started, and took several weeks getting ovet
his injuries each time. And he fell once too often —■
his tire suddenly slipped from the rim and down he
came. After six’ months in hospital, he comes out on
crutches possibly acripple for life. Also, as his acoident took
place on the training-track, he was robbed of the generous
response from the public that a big dramatic smash dur-
ing a race would have elicited. Clem Fisher, the long
Maorilander, was another man who used to fall in nearly
every start, but Kirk’s misfortune came as a warning,
and Fisher now looks on.

9 points to 8. Wentworth beat Wallaroo by 8 points to
3 ; and the Pirates beat Paddington by 10 points to 7.

The lovely Larpent-Leaver slander-case, at
Sydney, has been compromised by defendant
climbing down, retracting all his charges, and
paying plaintiff s costs. Even Jack Want couldn’t
save him when Miss Larpent submitted herself to
a medical examination, which showed that the
charges of immorality were unfounded. So that
the evidence of the tram-conductor and co
who s wore with a great deal of precision as to
Miss Larpent’s condition when they met her in
Melbourne, turns out to be pure imagination—or
mixed imagination, which is worse. Case shows
how unwise it is for any man to rely on his un-
assisted eyesight, or his assisted prejudices, in
such matters. Dear woman has always, if she is
innocent, such a conclusive argument in reserve.
That is, so far as infantile epilogues to the fifth
act go—there is never any certitude about the
fifth act without an epilogue.

GENERAL DEBILITY
and Indigestion
Made Her Life Miserable, but Slie is
Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Read the testimony of Mrs. E. G.
Monro, Coburg, Victoria, whose por-
trait is also given:
“Some few years ago I suffered
terribly with indigestion and gen-
eral debility. I could not sleep,
and my condition was such as to
make my life miserable. None of
the many remedies I tried did me
any good, and I despaired of ever
getting better. One of my friends
told me of the blood-purifying and
strength-giving properties of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and I began taking it.
Before 1 had finished the first bottle
I felt better, and was thus encour-
aged to give the medicine a thorough
trial. In all I used four bottles,
and then was perfectly cured of the
grievous trouble which had afflicted
me. I now recommend, to anyone
suffering as I did.

Gr.P.B. writes from Maoriland :
Henry Lawson has settled in Kaikoura (M.L.) as school-
master at the Maori pah school. If it is inspiration he is
seeking he should certainly find it in Kaikoura —for of all
picturesque and outrd spots the writer knows Kaikoura
conies first. The town, which has a population of only a
few hundred, is along continuity of line (“ length with-
out breadth ”), reminding one of a battalion of cornstalk
volunteers advancing in skirmishing order. One side of
the street fronts the sea. The other side has not
arrived yet. The long, roaring billows of the Pacific
fill the air with clamor, and frequently heave their
wind-clipped crests across the main roadway, and up
to the very doors of the houses. The town is entirely
supported by the surrounding sheep-runs, and the
staple topic for conversation or argument, apart from
wool and mutton, is the question as to how long may
elapse before the sea shall have washed away the existing
nucleus of a street. Kaikoura is the town of the glorious
“bender”—and the regular inhabitants only smile toler-
antly, with a used-to-it aspect, when they see a beer-
emburdened shepherd working-up imaginary sheep with
the aid of a pained and wondering sheep-dog. Lawson
will find the place full of “Sweeneyish” and other
characters, who only need to be limned by his facile pen
to be notorious. The scenery around is good and diversi-
fied, and should be duly appreciated by Henry, after what
he terms the “wearying sameness” of the Australian
bush ; and, unless the task of teaching the native mind
ttie mysteries of numeration and conjugation prove
to be a set-back, we may expect soon to hear from him
some of the deeper-set measures in which he is heard at
his best.
Some stories about Australia’s great
botanist, the late Baron Von Mueller: —
The simple-minded Baron was an enemy of disorder,
and w ould often pick up scraps of paper, no matter how
small, whenever he found them lying about his garden or
elsewhere. Sometimes he would call his servants and
with many a gesture say to them: “Behold how I, the
great Baron von Mueller, an English knight and a German
Baron, have to pick up the scraps of paper which you
ought to have picked up!” The Baron was much
I bothered by beggars, who would sometimes not be satis-
fied w'ith the sixpenny-bit offered them by the scientists
attendant. Then the Baron himself would come out, and
; in a long lecture tell the applicant for relief his domestic
; troubles how much he owed on his house, how much his
, house needed repairs, how long a time it was since he had
i bought a new hat for himself, &c. Then he would
soundly abuse the applicant, and, after having thus
I eased his heart, would give the poor fellow half-a-crown.
One morning about 3 a.m., the Baron was awakened by a
man who had jumped the garden-fence, and who knocked
very loudly at the front-door. The Baron got up, and at
length succeeded in awakening his attendant. The
latter, armed with an iron bar, opened the door, and
was confronted by an intoxicated person who demanded
money. The attendant closed w'ith him, while the Baron
stood wringing his hands and wanted to give the man
who had disturbed his repose half-a-crow’n to go away.
The Baron was very talkative. Sometimes he would call
in his attendant, and to him he would ease his mind by
running down certain persons. Occasionally he would
hear a noise in the kitchen, and would ask whether there
were any visitors. “ Oh, yes,” the attendant would say,
“ there is a friend of mine.” “But he doesn’t understand
German, does he?” “Yes, I believe he does.” “Oh,
well, it doesn’t matter, for, after all, I have said nothing
against the man, have I?” Mr. Guilfoyle, who succeeded
him as curator of Melb. Botanic Gardens, was an especial
enemy of the Baron’s. One day the Baron got on a tram
and, as was his custom, he turned to the man sitting next
to him and began abusingGuilfoyle in unmeasured terms.
The person addressed said nothing, and a few minutes
later the Baron found out that he had been blackguarding
Guilfoyle to Guilfoyle’s own face on that occasion.
A snake perjury that is not hackneyed.
Brown relates how, at Croydon the other day, a
big snake was camping comfortably beside him in
his blankets. The reptile went away to a neign-
boring hen-roost, collared a chicken, and then
came back, fuller and fatter, and passed the rest
of the night in Brown’s company. One or two
little improbabilities may appear in this narrative,
but the word of a Brown is sufficient.
IN THE DAY OF DESPAIR.
Man rose up in a hard, despairing prime,
And said, “Lord, 10, I cannot fight with Time !
God spake to him and answered pityingly,
“ Thou tightest Time : / tight Eternity ! ”

Mr. Button writes later:—“The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.”

It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My

internal kind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.

Sam. King Miller, schoolmaster and jour-

N.S.W. Public Service, is dead at 66. A few
years ago he bought Mossvale Scrutineer from
Chairman of Committees M‘Court.
A bitter t’othersider, per medium of a
godless Westralian paper, proposes that a law be
passed “ to do without God for six months and
appoint John Forrest to the post.” But, then,
they’ve done it already—to a great extent, at least.
The true Westralian really doesn’t know for cer-
tain which is God and which is John Forrest.
The cable reports that the new Austrian
Reichsrath has met and smashed most of the Par-
liamentary furniture, and that the members threw
the ink-bottles at each other’s heads, and hada rous-
ing fight which lasted two hours. There are just
now 25 parties in the Austrian Legislature, and it
appears they are all more or less against the
Badeni Ministry, which refuses to resign. The
only thing wanted to make that gathering com-
plete is John M‘Elhone.
It ought to be generally known that Rose’s
Lime Juice Cordial supplies a delicious cooling
drink in water —effervescing in all mineral waters
- and an excellent stimulant blended with spirits,
wholesome and refreshing in summer. It is en-
tirely free of spirits. Recommended by the
Lancet. It possesses valuable medicinal pro-
perties, cooling and purifying the blood, stimu-
lating and assisting digestion. Purchasers should
be careful to order only Rose’s Cordial, all others
being imitations.*
Sensation in the pulpit. Rev. W. L.
Laufman, of Cadillac, Michigan, U.S.A., recently
advertised that on a certain Sunday he would, to
illustrate an anti-tobacco sermon, kill two cats in
the pulpit of the local Methodist church. A
packed congregation rolled up to see the show.
Prominent on the pulpit were packages of fine-
cut, plug, and chewing tobacco. At a selected
point in the tirade an assistant brought up the
cats, and a Dr. Miller administered nicotine to
them. The first cat died, squealing and squirm-
ing, in a minute and a-half. The second vomited
all over the pulpit, but died in a minute and
a-quarter after getting a second dose. Then
this “ humble follower ” announced to the
thrilled congregation that next Sunday he
would kill some more cats, to show the evil effects
of alcohol, and would also have on exhibition the
stomach of a drunkard. Authority, the Medical
Record.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
Gladstone as a phrase-maker in his 80’s.
In his massive letter on the Eastern Question,
published in London D.T., the G.O.M. gets off
such as these :
“ From the official to the personal conscience.” “ In-
clination does not suffice to justify silence.” “Abdul
Hamid, the Great Assassin.” “ Every extreme of wicked-
ness is sacrosanct when it passes in a Turkish garb.”
“Treadintr on the burning cindersof Armenian massacres.”
“ Lord Granville was the mildest of men, but mildness
may keep company with revolution.” “ The reign of
wrong is not eternal.” “Small of stature, but full of
fight.” (A picture of Greece and the Powers : “ A David
facing six Goliaths.”) “This bad dream of Ottoman
dominion.”
Mr. Fisher, of Messrs. Fisher and Ling-
ham, Vic. Arcade, Sydney, having bought out his
partner, who has gone back to America, will
carry on the business under the same title, and
with the same up-to-dateness. One live depart-
ment is providing the National Cash Register,
which evokes big testimonials from Messrs. Las-
setter and Co. and other well-known firms. The
Register manufacturers have supplied a full stand-
ing army of storekeepers.*
There was much excitement in Melbourne
Benevolent Asylum one day last week, when an
ancient inmate, with his snowy hair a-hanging
down his back, was lugged before the committee
to explain why he absolutely refused to be cropped,
and why he armed himself with a hunk of firewood
and beat off the asylum barber whenever that
individual bore down upon him with drawn
scissors. “Please, gentlemen, can’t I keep my
little bit of hair ? ” piteously pleaded the insur-
rectionary ancient; but the committee fiercely
commanded him to be barbered, and the victim
was ruthlessly dragged away to execution,
struggling gamely in defence of his “little bit of
hair.” No doubt the old man was clapped into a
straight waistcoat and forcibly cropped, it being
the regulation and respectable thing for criminals
and paupers to be hideously barbered. Why, The
Bulletin asks, should this pampered pauper be
allowed to keep his hair on when so many conse-
quential and solid gentlemen are as barren of hair
as a cast-iron tombstone ?

An Important Case .
A CONCERT AND MEDICAL COMPANY
COME TO GRIEF.
DETECTED IN SELLING A PINK
COLORED PILL, WHICH THEY RE-
PRESENTED TO BE DR. WILLIAMS
PINK PILLS—THE COURT GRANT AN
INJUNCTION RESTRAINING I HEM
FROM OFFERING AN IMITATION
OF THIS GREAT MEDICINE— SOME
FACTS THE PUBLIC WILL DO WELL
TO BEAR IN MIND.
“ In the Equity Court yesterday, before Mr.
Justice A. H. Simpson, Mr. Knox and Mr.
Scarvel (instructed by Messrs. Johnson, Ibn >
Simpson and Co.), appeared for George Taylor
Fulford. of New York, proprietor of Dr Williams
Pink Pills for Pale People, and applied for an
injunction restraining L. R. Davis, P. Da,vis, an
G. R. Carey, of Glen Innes, from selling any
imitations of the genuine Dr. Williams Pink
Pills. The defendants were not represented, it
was stated that the defendants had been served
with a statement of claim, and affidavits were put
in setting out that the defendants were said to
have sold Pink Pills at Glen Innes and elsewhere.
His Honor made the order granting the injunction
pending the hearing of a suit which had been
instituted to restrain the defendants selling the
pills referred to.” , ,
The above paragraph, taken from the legal
columns of the Sydney Telegraph, contains a
warning which every person in Australia in need
of a medicine will do well to heed, and shows the
care and pains the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Com-
pany takes to protect the public from imposition,
and to preserve the reputation of their famous
Pink Pills.
It is only a medicine that possesses more than
usual merit that is worth imitation. Ordinary
medicines are not subject to that kind of treat-
ment, as there is not sufficient demand for such
medicine worth while.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People have
achieved a reputation for sterling merit un-
paralleled in the history of medical science. In
every part of the Dominion the remarkable cures
wrought by the use of this great medicine have
given it a name and a fame which has made the
sale of Pink Pills simply wonderful.
It is because of this great merit, and the conse-
quent enormous demand for the medicine, that it
is being imitated by unscrupulous persons in
various parts of the colony. The imitation is
cheap, usually worthless, and is only pushed be-
cause the imitator can make much more money by
its sale than he can by the sale of the genuine
Pink Pills. Hence the pains he takes to sell the
imitation.
The Dr. Williams’ Medicine Company annually
spends thousands of pounds endeavoring to im-
press the public that the genuine Pink Pills can
only be purchased in one form —namely, in
packages enclosed in a wrapper (or label), which
bears the full trade mark, “ Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for Pale People.” No one can buy them in
any other form, not even if they offered many
times their weight in gold for them. And yet in
the face of these continuous warnings there are
people confiding enough to permit some unscrupu-
lous dealer to convince them that he can supply
them with the genuine Pink Pills in loose form by
the dozen or hundred, or ounce, or in some other
kind of box. Any one who pretends to be able to
do this is telling an untruth. Bear this in mind
and refuse all pills that do not bear the full trade
mark, no matter if they are colored pink, and no
matter what the dealer says.
Please bear in mind also that the formula from
which Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills is compounded is
a secret known only to the company and any one
who claims he can supply you with some other pill
‘ just as good ” is guilty of misreprentation, for
he does not know the ingredients of the genuine
Pink Pills and is only trying to sell you some other
pill, because he makes more money on its sale.
The Dr. Williams’ Medicine Company is deter-
mined to spare no expense in protecting both the
public and themselves against these unscrupulous
imitators, and will always be thankful to receive
information concerning any one who offers to sell
an imitation Pink Pill purporting it to be Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills, or “the same as” the
genuine Pink Pills. Such cases will be investigated
by the company’s detective and the name of the
person giving the information will not be made
public, while any expense entailed in sending us
the information will be promptly refunded.
Ask for Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People
and take nothing else. They cure when all other
medicines fail.*

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than .any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
These Bitters I recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chromo
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D.: —The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I And these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.

Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to al
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION. —Wheu you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

At Wagga, the other day, when it turned
out that the two parties to an assault-case had
had a regular fight ? the acting P.M. fined both
for “ riotous behaviour ” —thus actually punishing,
in the plaintiff, a man who was not before him on
any charge; “a proceeding,” blandly observed
Judge Cohen, in granting a prohibition, “ which
seems tome to be opposed to natural justice.”

bulating there ? ’
There has been an active demand for
divorces in Melbourne recently. In most cases
the husband has been made conspicuous by his
absence, having gone out to look at the moon,
shortly after the marriage, and suddenly mislaid
himself, and disappeared from all mortal know-
ledge. In divorce, disappearances are deceitful,
and Judge A’Beckett suddenly demands corrobo-
rative evidence in such cases, and asserts that the
Court must be satisfied that the husband has left
for good before the separator will work in the
future. This is rough on the lone, lorn woman
whose husband has gone off without a report, and
is seeking rest and change in parts unknown.
The wife knows her husband has gone, and that
the domestic cupboard is bare, but she knows
nothing about the intentions of the alleged pro-
vider, and, whilst she is foraging round for proofs
that he is gone for good, and has got another wife
and family in Darkest Africa, and has no intention
of returning in 10 years or so, she will grow so old
and lank and homely that a divorce will be no
possible good to her when she gets it.

A “ Record Reign commemoration suggestion
in favor at Broken Hill is the'establishment of a con
valescent home for workmen suffering from lead-poison
ing. Perhaps not more than half the total number of
employes “escape the lead” altogether, yet not Y, per
cent, are fit subjects for admission to the ordinarv'hos-
pital. But the undertaking is too big for the people who
five in Broken Hill; and there is no movement among the
tens of thousands outside, who benefit by these men’s un-
wholesome labors.
Vanzetti, promoter of the public crushing works
erected at Northam, W.A., is now in London with a
scheme to carry tramways and other things to the mining
camps and mines of that country. It will only cost two
millions. Finding things mighty sick in the land of the
milch-cow, he has furnished British Australasian with
an eight-column interview on the death of the boom and
the cause thereof. “ The blame may be laid down mainlv
at the door of financial corruption, ruse and chicanery
on the one side, and to rashness, inconsistency, and in-
competency on the other. . . . Everyone forgot his
calling or qualifications, and jumped off his groove in
order to enter new fields more promising in the exciting
hunt after rapid and easily-gotten fortunes. This sudden
revelation and astounding success of the moment, arrested
attention and told on the people at large ; the fever for
wealth became contagious and the temptation irresis-
tible. Capital began to flow to the new world in
the expectation that in the wink of an eye it would
double and treble. Financial institutions threw open
their ooffers. These booms, their meteoric splendor,
short duration, and inevitable collapse, are typical of the
Australian provinces, and it must be that the English in-
vestor will not profit or be advised by past experience, or
else the recurrence of similar fits of insanity and delusion
would not possibly take place at such short intervals, and
under circumstances so identical as to render repeti-
tion not only inexplicable, but almost ludicrous. The
reaction which takes place immediately after, and which
causes people otherwise rational and intelligent to rush
from one extreme to the other, is quite as unwarrantable
as the boom itself.” The salvation for Westralia, proposed
by Mr. Vanzetti, is the removing of ores to the locality
of the water supplies. This, he thinks, would lead to the
consolidation of mines, fusion of capital, concentration of
machinery, uniformity of operations, etc. Of the Northam
works he says they extract from 80 to 90 per cent, against
60 to 65 per cent, on the fields, but makes no attempt to
explain how ores treated in exactly the same way give
from 20 to 30 per cent, more gold in one place than an-
other. Is it on account of the railway journey ?

An example of Scotch thrift: “On the Tas.
west coast, a certain Caledonian keeps a general store,
and has supplied one family with goods for the past two
and a-half years, to the value of not less than 20s. weekly.
The accounts, which invariably ended with a halfpenny,
were settled monthly by cheque, the halfpenny always
being struck out. Well, last week, the account for April
was presented (the halfpenny on this occasion being very
prominent), together with another account for Is. 3|d.
(31 items, and extending over two and a-half years), the
items reading, ‘ Balance of a/c., Jan’y, Jd.,’ ‘ Balance of
a/c., Feb’y, £d.,’ and so on for each month for 31 months,
and attached was a memo, asking for ‘ immediate settle-
ment.’ ”

Churches are plentiful in the gilded West, Kal-

OhnrchVfii' th f t dust ibegnmed town is owned by the
£kurch of England. This body has, of course, erected a
noble building on one of its frontages to two of the
principal streets—for the praise and glory of God? Not
much . It loves too well the golden calf. The frontages
are let on building leases at enormous rentals, and the
House of God is accommodated with a site at the rear of
a pile of buildings. The worshippers are edified by
the incense which reaches them from a row of latrines
and a stable, separated from the church only by a ten-foot
right-of-way.

At Thursday Island, before the Commission, a
white man testified that pearl-shell was as good a show as

a certainty, and had no fear of droughts.

The Melbourne real estate market is, however,
at present so limited that it can scarcely be held to exist,”

to its “ normal” (i.e., boom-time) value.

The Coolgardie Consolidated Gold Mines, capi-
tal, £lOO,OOO, of which £75,000 went to vendors, failed in
an attempt to shift its operations to some other mine in
Victoria. Justice Byrne held that the words “ in
Westralia, or elsewhere,” provided in the memorandum of
association, were of too vague a character to compel
shareholders who had put up money for one thing to
spend it on another. Commerce, an out-spoken London
paper, is very rough on the Consolidated “ It is almost
unnecessary to add that the prospectus held out all sorts
of sanguine promise and glowing anticipations. It shows
what a drug poetry must be in the market that men,
capable of such lofty and perfervid flights of imagination,
should find remunerative employment in writing reports
on mines. Like so many other W.A. mines, it justified
the definition of a gold-mine as a hole in the ground into
which foolish people pour their gold. The Judge pointed
out that an investigation into the history of the co. would
not be unprofitable. The clearing of the atmosphere will
not only put investors on their guard, but will be of
assistance to genuine Westralian enterprises. At present
both the good and the bad are naturally tarred with the
same'brush.” W.A. “cat” exposures may be long de-
layed, but they cannot be evaded. They are already
making some of the big boonisters squirm.

Editor Bulletin, — The Queensland press gives
currency to a report that “ a rich reef has been found on
the Port Moresby side of the Dividing Range,” &c. There
is absolutely no foundation for the statement, and it
reflects much discredit upon its disseminators. No reef—
good, bad, or indifferent—has been found, and the excite-
ment caused here is new to us. Such statements cause
incalculable misery, as there is nothing for the poor man
to fall back on on his reaching this' country but his
chance for gold. At present nothing further is known
than has been known for the last three months. The
Government is beginning to recognise that some pro-
vision will have to be made for the sick, and is doing
what it can with its limited means.—Yours faithfully,
F. A. Roohfort. Port Moresby, New Guinea, 26th April,

One of a party of prospectors who left Hannan’s
nearly three months ago for New Guinea tells a horrible
story of the deception practised on them, and the straits
in which they were placed in a futile attempt to reach the
alleged goldfield. The first delusion was in making
for Port Moresby, instead of going to the other side
of the island and up the Mambare. It is the ambi-
tion of Port Moresby to become the Port Jackson of N.G.
To reach the field from there a climb of 10,000 ft. and a
descent of 8000 ft. have to be made. Native carriers
can t be got, and if they could, they could only carry
their own food, and, being naked, they have a habit of
dying from cold when 10,000 ft. above sea-level. Nearly
all the prospectors who tackled it have returned except
those who died, and now a great many are hanging
around the port awaiting a chance to get back. The
Governor, it is declared, should have issued a proclama-
tion warning miners on no account to come that way, and
the shipping companies, having made money by bringing
them to such a no-man’s land, should be compelled to
take them away again.

The New Japan .
[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
(Ridiculously cheap Japanese matches were recently ov
sale m Sydney.)
The new Japan in triumph moves
lowards cheaper goods than Europe knew
What wonder then ! It merely proves
That “ too far West is East ” is true.
And so for Europe’s golden bars
Japan her safety-matches trucks,
And sale of other matches mars :
What then ! “Ex Oriente lux.”
They tell us that the eastern hive,
Which we so lightly deemed effete,
Is very full indeed of life,
And like to prove us obsolete.
They tell us that the brown man means
To make things for us very hard :
To work us with our own machines,
And hoist us with our own petard.
Ah, well, if such success should crown
The little men, I’ll change my guise—
I’ll do myself extremely brown,
And have a surgeon slant my eyes.
I know now how to fan a flirt,
But if she come from far Japan,
I’ll have to be far more expert,
And so must learn to flirt a fan.
Our Art, alas ! the Art we knew
No more shall things Australian vaunt,
For o’er it then in every hue
The. “ loud chrysanthemum ” shall flaunt.
The stockmen and their dusty plains,
The weary swagmen and their billies,
Must yield their place to flying cranes,
The stork, the pond, and waterlilies.
The poet shall no more rehearse
His songs by aid of beer or baccy,
He’ll have to coin his cunning verse
By inspiration sought in saki.
O quaint Japan ! O pleasant land !
Why sacrifice your sweet ideal ?
Why strive to wear the Western brand,
So crudely and absurdly real ?
Why strive to mix in Western strife
And all the trouble that it brings ?
Why not teach us your pleasant life,
Your happy use of simple things ?
What shall you gain when all is done,
But Western greed and Western pain ?
Whall you win when all is won
But ceaseless toil of hand and brain ?
And in the changes that attend,
No greater gain to us attaches ;
We lose a very pleasant friend,
We gain—-a peddler of cheap matches.

Love in a Cottage .
[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
We sit in the dusk with each other
(For candles are eightpence a pound),
And I hear of the letter from “ Mother,*
And how Mrs. M‘Lean has “been round,”
How the pretty new hat she was flashing
Was cheaper than Mary’s by far ;
How the woman was here for the washing,
And how big our chrysanthemums are ;
How bread has gone up in a hurry,
And “ the man ” says that coals will be dear,
And that she doesn’t like me to worry,
But the winter will shortly be here ;
How she blistered her hand in the baking
(I must kiss it, to banish the pain . . .)
Blessed Lord ! am I sleeping or waking ?
For I ve seen the old fellows again.
I met them to-day in the city—
All three of them—happy as kings ;
And their talk was unhampered and witty,
For they know not the prices of things.
Con pays (it is true) at the laundries,
But that is his only expense ;
All Roley’s disbursements are “ Sundries,”
And Mao. lights his fire with the fence.
They are wealthy just now—gold and glory
For nearly a day they have known ;
“ Some ass has accepted a story,
And Con takes his oath it’s his own.”
And Mac. sold a picture—“ Behold him !
Charles Xerxes M'Ketizie, R.I. !”
“ The rottenest tripe ! ” “So I told him ;
“ That’s all that the beggars will buy.”
Dead, dead are those seasons of clamour,
When the world was untrammelled and young,
And every new girl was a glamour
That lived to be painted and sung.
Was it worth it, to give up the turban
And lead a monogamous life,
For the joys of a villa suburban
And a file of accounts for a wife ?
Eheu —what's the finish I—fugaces /
(I never did Latin at school),
I am fresh from the sight of their faces,
And I’m sorry—that I was a fool.
For the worst ways of life are the clearest,
And the man that pays rent is an ass ;
And I wish I had never . . . what, dearest?
Yes, you gave me the bill for the gas.

Caulfield and Whitechapel .
[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
“I don’t care if I die to-morra —I’ve seen London!”
I stopped to listen to Twanltey Mullins, the
Caulfield citizen known to fame as a jockey in the
old days, and more recently for having been in
charge of Chopsticks, the celebrated “ lepper,” on
his voyage to England in the Ballaarat.
“I’ll be willin’ to die ternight,” continued
Twankey, “ and happy, too. London’s good
enough for me. . . . Why, blimey! things
happen in London as would drive the bobbies
here balmy. . . . One night I seen a lot of fac-
tory girls dahnemg on the side of the road,
near a barrel-organ. The man was turning the
’andle like mad, and the girls was dahneing
lovely—high-kicking and all. And the bobbies
never so much as arst them to move on, even—
much less run ’em in. . . . And there was a little
white donkey ’arnessed to the organ . . . and
a girl’s petticoat come off, and wot does she do
but put it on the donkey’s forelegs and tie the
strings behind his neck. Lord ! it was lovely !
When the dahnee was done, I sez to a little girl
as stopped near me :
“ ‘ Get ’em to do it again, and I’ll stand drinks.’
“So they dahneed again. Then my little girl
took me by the arm, and ses :
“ ‘ Come on ! ’
“ ‘Wot ! ’ ses I, ‘ ain’t yer mates cornin’ too ? ’
“‘Lord !’ she says, ‘are ye goin’ to treat the
crowd ? ’
‘ ‘ Sc* she gets her mates together, and along we
goes. The first pub. we come to, they won’t serve
us.
“ ‘ Never mind,’ ses the girls ; ‘we know a de-
cent place. ’
“So we all goes along. In the pub, I asks them
wot they’ll ’ave.
“ ‘ Oh, we’ll have a pot of beer,’ says my little
girl.
“‘Wot,’ ses I, ‘one pot between a dozen of
you ! ’
“ ‘ All right! ’ ses my little girl ; ‘ three pots.’
“ So they ’ad their three pots, and I ’ad a little
pinch o’ w’isky. Then they ’ad another three
pots and another. And wot d’yer think the lot
cost me ? It cost me a bob !
“ So then we goes back to the organ and we ’as
more dahnein’ and some singin’. When it was
gettin’ a bit late, I stoops and w’ispers to my
little girl.
“She looks at me sort of scared.
“ ‘ No, mister,’ she says ; ‘ we’ll dahnee for yer,
we’ll sing for yer, and we’ll drink yer beer for yer
—but anythin’ more means workus for us ! ’
“Lord, I didn’t think there was so much virtue
in the world !
“ So we ’ad three more pots of beer and a pinch of
w’isky, an I goes back to my doss.
“I saw my little girl and her mates lots of times
after that, and they always give me a dahnee—
and when I was cornin’ back ’ome they all lines up
on the docks, and gi ves me three cheers, and my
little girl throws her arms around my neck, and
ses :
“ ‘Lord, mister ! yer the biggest toff that ever
came to these parts—and we’re very sorry yer
goin ? ’
“ So I don’t care if I die this minnit—becos I’ve
seen London! ”

And now I hear that Twankey has gone
back to London with still another hurdle-racer.

Poison Fever.
[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
Giulo was an Italian, and owned a small Queens-
land sheep-run. He was hospitable to his equals
and generous to his dependents, but, high and
low, he’d poison their dogs when he got a chance.
He had begun in the early days by laying baits
for the dingoes that “ worried ” his sheep and the
crows that killed his lambs. The habit became a
mania; he poisoned domestic cats and dogs,
dropped baits in his neighbors’ paddocks for their
dogs, and all along the road to town for anybody s
dogs. Part of the regular morning work at the
station was to cut baits and pepper them with
strychnine. These were either laid by
given for that purpose to one of the “ hands
who would take them into the first paddock and
disgustedly throw them away. All the hands
grumbled that their best dogs had been “ pizened,”
except the short and fat Mrs. Williamson, wife of
the boundary-rider (Giulo was afraid of her
tongue), and Bill Dixon, the horse-breaker, who
looked sharply after his little terrier —it was a
gift, and the one soft spot in Bill’s hard heart.
The boss’s dread of Mrs. Williamson had alone
saved her sheepdog, but one morning his valor
overcame his discretion, and, after a visit from
him, the Williamsons were busy cutting off their
dog’s tail and forcing tobacco-juice down its
throat, the rough and ready bush “first aid to
the poisoned.” But in vain : and that night Bill
Dixon waxed very funny at their loss, and Giulo,
after an excited interview with Mrs. Williamson,
during which she held the floor, spluttered to his
wife, “ By de gods de little English woman is in
a pelter.”
Bill continued to poke borak as he passed
Williamson’s ; till one evening they noticed that
he went by silently, followed by his terrier with a
couple of inches of tail missing and a very sickly
look about its jaws. About a week after that, one
ear was gone, and Bill looked gloomy. Later on
the other ear went, and after a spell of three or
four weeks that dog trotted home behind a cursing
horsebreaker, with no tail left at all.
Speculation now waxed fierce among the neigh-
bors as to what Bill would cut off next. One
night they found Bill, with a tear in his eye, over
a stiff and cold terrier. “ Went off while I was
considerin’ whether to chop off a paw or a junk of
his lip,” he explained ; and shaking his fist at
the homestead, he added, “I’ll settle with that
there Italian before the devil yet, and when
he’s in hell, may all the strychnine that ever
growed in beans be rammed down his ugly throat,
and may all the torturin’s and twistm’s of the
poor beasts he’s pizened be ”
“ By de gods, de very man I was looking for.
Bill, I want you to take some baits out in de
morning. ”
“ Right you are, sir. Goodnight, sir.”
EUBOTAH.
In Italy, the church marriage is invalid in
law, and the civil marriage is no marriage in the
eyes of the Church. Consequently, a man may
have practically two spouses—the civil wife’s
children “born out of wedlock,” according to the
Church, and those of the ecclesiastical wife illegi-
timate in the eyes of the state. According to
both authorities there would be a wife and a con-
cubine, the difference being as to which would be
which.
In Blind Alley .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A narrow lane within five minutes walk of thb
Post Office. Not a clean lane—the gutters trea-
sure much filth and garbage. Not a respectable
lane : and, in point of fact, not a lane at all—a
cul-de-sac. It is used as a front and back yard by
the occupants of huddled houses on each side,
and washing hangs limply on hay-band lines swung
from house to house, crossing and recrossing the
way. Ihe washing ’does not tend to increaw
one , g respect f or the wives of Blind Alley, most of
whom are squatted along the kerbing, chattine

THESE AILMENTS ARE CURED BY
pr. williams* pink PILLS FOR PALE PEOPLE
Why Suffer Agonising- Pain when the Remedy
is within your Reach ?
An Aunt’s Advice.
BROUGHT A YOUNG LADY OUT OR
THE SHADOW OE DEATH.
INFLUENZA CONQUERED.
A Remarkable Case that vividly shows the won-
derful Health-restoring Powers of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills.
(From the Orangeville Banner.)
There is no doubt at all that many people are
prejudiced against proprietary medicines, and
equally, no doubt, many look upon the testi-
monials published as much in the nature of an
exaggerated puff. If the Banner had been tinc-
tured with this feeling it has, so far as one medi-
cine is concerned, had its doubts removed. We
refer to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, concerning the
curative qualities of which strong claims have been
made, and proofs advanced in their support which
seemed equally strong. But it is when one comes
across in their own locality a case almost rivaling
any that has been made public, that doubt disap-
pears and conviction follows. Such a case the
Banner came across and investigated, and now
gives the facts. The case is that of Miss Sarah
Langford, an estimable young lady who resides in
the neighborhood of Camilla. We were told she
had been brought near to death’s door, and had
I2U(.
ft.
<■
WBII*
BWi
been restored to
health through the
agency of Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills.
We decided, how-
ever, to cast hear-
say aside, and in-
vestigate for our-
selves.
We found Miss
Langford the pic-
ture of health and
good spirits, at her
pleasant home in
Camilla, In re-
sponse to our in-
quiries as to her ill-
ness and the cause
of her recovery, she
expressed her wil-
lingness to satisfy
our curiosity, and
as she added, relate her experience for the good of
others afflicted as she was. Her story, very
briefly, was as follows t —
“ I had influenza in the Spring of 1894. I did
not seem to get over the effects of the attack, and
as the summer progressed, became weak and list-
less. Any kind of work became a burden to me.
After pumping a pail of water from the well, I
would have to stand to hold my hand over my
heart for a moment or so, it would flutter so vio-
lently. I could not go upstairs without difficulty,
and towards the last would have to rest on the
steps, and when I got to the top, lie down until I
could recover my breath. I became a mere
skeleton; my cheeks were like wax and my lips
colorless. I lost all appetite, and my meals often
went untasted. Medicine seemed to have no effect
upon me. I was getting weaker all the time, and
at last began to give up hope of recovery. My
parents were, of course, in great distress, and I
knew by the looks and actions of friends who
called to see me that they thought I was doomed
to an early death. Then a dear lady friend died,
and I managed, out of love for her, to drag myself
to her funeral. The sensation of seeing her laid
away, believing that I would soon follow her, was
a strange one. Shortly after this an aunt of mine,
Mrs. Wm. Henderson, of Toronto, came to visit
at our place. My condition troubled her very
much, and she insisted on my trying Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. To please her I consented, but with
little hope of any good result. The effect, how-
ever, was wonderful, and a pleasing surprise to
me. I soon began to feel more cheerful and
seemed to feel stronger. Then my appetite began
to improve and the color return to my cheeks and
lips. Prom that hour I steadily gained strength,
and was soon enjoying my former excellent health,
slnce £?. ln expressing my belief that to
Ur. Wimams Pink Pills do I owe my recovery.”
Inquiry among neighbors corroborated Miss
-Langford s story as to her illness and remarkable
recovery In her case, at least, Dr. Williams’
l ink Pills have given a striking proof that they
possess wonderful merits.
Rheumatic Gout.—A Master
Mariner’s Escape.
(Shields Daily News.)
Case of Capt. Holland, master mariner, Doek-
wray Bank, East Holborn, South Shields. Ex-
posure to the weather had so crippled him that he
was totally in-
capacitated for
active exertions
by rheumatism
and rheumatio
gout, from which
he had suffered
for nearly nine
years. Three
dootors had
treated him
without effect.
He suffered daily
the most agoni-
sing pains in
limbs and body.
There was con-
v'
siderable swelling of the joints, and altogether he
had a most miserable time. Happening to come
across an article in a newspaper describing the
cure of a similar case by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
he resorted to the same means as a last hope of
recovery Asked the result of this proceeding, he

once since taking the pills, and this was a slight
attack which a few pills very speedily dispelled.
1 feel myself a young man again.” y
Pale and Sallow Girls.
What can be more distressing than to see a girl
drooping and fading in the springtime of youth ’
Instead of bright eyes, glowing, rosy cheeks, and
an elastic step, there are dull eyes, pale, sallow or
greenish complexion, and a languidness of step
that bespeaks disease and an early death if proper
treatment is not promptly resorted to and per-
sisted m until the impoverished blood is enriched
and the functions of life become regular. Upon
parents rests a great responsibility at the time
their daughters are budding into womanhood. If
your daughter is pale, complains of weakness, is
out ” upon the slightest exertion; if she is
troubled with headache or backache, pain in the
side ; if her temper is fitful and her appetite poor,
she is in a condition of extreme peril, a fit subject
for the development of that most dreaded of all
diseases consumption. If you notice any of the
symptoms, lose no time in procuring Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills. They will assist the patient
to develop properly and regularly ; they will en-
rich the blood, and restore health’s roses to the
cheeks; bright eyes and lightness of step will
surely follow their use, and all danger of con-
sumption and premature death will be averted.
Wise and prudent mothers will insist upon their
daughters taking Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills upon
the approach of the period of. puberty, and thus
avoid all chances of disease or early decay.
