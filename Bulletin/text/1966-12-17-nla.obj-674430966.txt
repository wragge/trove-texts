WHY?
When Rover set out
to design the ‘2ooo’
they threw the book away. There
is nothing of standard pattern
about this car, no concession to "popular"
taste. What Rover did was to design a car
from the tyres up not according to how
cars were, but according to how they
should be. For instance, a car should "go"
and it also should stop. So the '2ooo' has a
totally new overhead camshaft engine that
produces tremendous thrust. It can go
like a rocket. But it also has disc brakes all
round and radial ply tyres so it can stop
faster, more safely than any car you've
ever driven. A car should "handle" per-
fectly under all road conditions. So the
'2ooo' got itself a totally new suspension,
so good that the motoring writers have run
THEY CALL THE
ROVER
2000
THE ABSOLUTE CAR
out of superlatives. A car should protect
its occupants. So Rover designed the pas-
senger compartment as a rigid steel cage,
buffered at each end by a bonnet and boot
which "accordion" gradually on impact.
Then they carefully built in an incredible
fifty safety features. (They’re illustrated in
a leaflet we'll gladly send you.) Finally, a
car should have three personalities to suit
the mood of the driver. It should be a rip-
roaring sports car, a long-loping, mile-
eating, businessman's express and a
lavishly-appointed luxury limousine. The
Rover '2ooo' is all these things. It is the
mailed fist in the velvet glove. It is the
absolute car.

WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’65 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’65
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Hermitage
Long weeks of sunshine and
a rain-free vintage period
favoured the sensitive Her-
mitage (Shiraz) grapes in
1962. After two years in oak,
the wine was bottled and lain
down for further maturing.
Now obtainable, this Hermi-
tage is soft and generous
a full, distinctive wine.
Coonawarra Estate
’6O Cabernet
Made entirely from the rare
Cabernet Sauvignon grape,
this Cabernet was matured at
the Estate for two years in
oak and then further bottle-
matured for four years before
being released for sale. With
a pronounced Cabernet nose,
this wine is full and soft on
the palate, with a firm tannin
finish.
Modbury Estate
’65 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz* pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from.Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’65 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

LETTERS
Indonesia
Sir,
It takes a Knopfelmacher to assume
as given answers to the most conten-
tious issues in politics. His article on
Indonesia (8., Nov. 26) abounds with
sweeping and unsupported assertions, of
which the following are but a sample.
The coup: Dr. Knopfelmacher does
not feel any necessity to establish PKI
responsibility for the abortive coup of
October 1, 1965, despite the fact that
the doubts and disbelief of those who
have studied the events have grown
in proportion with the material that
has become available from the trials
and other sources. The extraordinary
features of the trial evidence, indeed,
are the extremely tenuous nature of
the allegations against the PKI, and
the mass of confusion, contradiction,
and fabrication that emerges whenever
an attempt is made to specify charges.
To ignore this may be good anti-
Communism, but that is all that can
be said for it.
The PKI and national bankruptcy:
to assert that the PKI deliberately
goaded Sukarno into ruinous policies
is excruciatingly funny when one con-
siders that virtually the entire Indo-
nesian political and military elite,
including the present ruling group,
were implicated up to their eyeballs in
the bloated militarism, wasteful expen-
ditures, corruption, and economic un-
reality of the Sukarno era. The PKI
did indeed encourage some of the
nationalist excesses of the period, but
by the same token it alone advanced
economic policies having any semblance
of rationality policies which were
understandably ignored by the elite
since they would have undercut the
privileged position of those in power.
PKI leaders’ corruption: Dr. Knop-
felmacher apparently accepts without
question the denunciations by KAMI
leaders, whose extreme anti-Commu-
nism makes them about as reliable as
Robert Welch. The “common miscon-
ception” of PKI puritanism happens to
be shared by every serious student of
Indonesian politics, some of whom
spent years in the country (as against
Dr. Knopfelmacher’s three days).

PKI flabbiness had led them to neg-

REX MORTIMER
Elsternwick (Vic.)
Vietnam Survey
Sir,
Professor Joyce Ackroyd’s defamatory
attack (8. 5 Dec. 3) on the sponsors of
the recent survey of academic opinion
invites a similarly acrimonious rejoinder.
We shall, nonetheless, restrict our
comments to any reasonable criticisms
of the survey which may be discover-
able in the interstices of her invective.
It is a matter for surprise that Pro-
fessor Ackroyd did not attempt to obtain
a copy of our Press release on the survey
before engaging in academic mayhem.
She appears to have been satisfied to
rest her attack largely on an assumption
that we were responsible, in detail and
with malice aforethought, for the precise
coverage given to our Press release by
a particular newspaper on a particular
day. We have posted a complete copy
of our Press release to Professor
Ackroyd and trust that she will recog-
nise a responsibility either to withdraw
her accusations or to substantiate them.
Because space will plainly not permit
our answering all of her accusations, we
shall reply here only to the most import-
ant.
Professor Ackroyd objects to the
survey on three main grounds: (1)
That our report misled readers con-
cerning the adequacy of the sample.
(2) That both sets of six clauses are
Leftish in flavor, with the pro-Vietnam
war statement being “palpably slanted,”
and (3) That 80 percent of those sur-
veyed either supported the Government
or were “disgusted with the whole
exercise.”
To take these seriatim:
(1) In our Press release, the third
sentence reads: “In all, 3906 survey
forms were sent out, and of this number
1337 (representing 34 percent) have
been returned.” A little later in the re-
lease, under “Limitations” of the survey,
we pointed out that follow-up studies at
the University of N.S.W. indicated that
non-respondents are equally divided on
the Vietnam issue. However, we con-
cluded that “. . . any generalisation from
(these) more elaborate investigations
carried out at N.S.W. requires extreme
caution.” Similarly, we pointed out that
it is “. . . impossible to know for certain
the extent to which those who did reply
can be taken to represent those who did
not.”
(2) A draft of the clauses represent-
ing the pro-Vietnam war position was
sent to a professor of political science
of pro-Government sentiment, with a
request that he suggest any modifica-
tions he believed necessary to make it
a fair statement of that viewpoint. All
but one of his several suggested alterna-
•tives were incorporated verbatim. Other
professors (both pro- and anti-) have
written complimenting us. on the fair-
ness of the contrasting statements.
(3) In a follow-up study at N.S.W.,
of 39 non-repliers it was found that
39 percent “intended replying but did
not get around to it,” 18 percent con-
sidered the survey “an infringement of
privacy,” ten percent held no particular
views on the Vietnam issue. Not one
gave as his reason for failing to reply
the “disgust with the whole exercise”
that Professor Ackroyd intuits to have
been so prevalent.
Professor Ackroyd implies that she is
exposing certain “facts” (such as our
lack of sympathy with the Vietnam
policies of our Government) otherwise
misleadingly concealed. Most of the
paragraph supporting this implied claim
is an unacknowledged quote from the


TAA - a profitable
business enterprise
with a record
of dependability
TAA earned a profit, after tax, of $1,202,357
in financial year 1965-66 continuing a
fine record of profitability. A fine record
of dependability and service too. More
passengers choose TAA than any other
single Australian airline.
TAA pays taxes and returns a dividend. Like a
public company, TAA is subject to income tax,
payroll tax, sales tax, etc. Plus route charges and tax
on fuel. TAA will pay dividend to the Com-
monwealth Treasury, amounting to $1,125,000 in the
1965-66 financial year.
TAA 1689/66
TAA must compete for all business. Every
passenger and pound of cargo that TAA carries must
be won in open business competition. In placing
business with TAA, supporters of free enterprise
are helping to preserve the right of every Australian
to choose by which airline he will fly, or consign
air cargo.

bring more pure jet travel to more places next
year, when the Airline introduces DC9 Whispering
T-Jets to supplement 727 services. TAA’s jet-age
leadership in service and dependability calls for the
spending of millions of dollars in projects like these: —
computer-controlled reservation system; palletised
cargo handling; 727 and DC9 flight simulators for
crew training, Costing $2,000,000; new and improved
passenger and cargo terminals.

Killing Adult Education
Sir,
As a general without an army, Mr.
Colin Badger (8., Dec. 3) is obliged
to use desperate tactics, but he might
well have spared us the hoary old
polemical trick of protesting that he
didn’t say what he did say and that
I didn’t say what I did say. However,
to indulge him in his new role of mis-
interpreted prophet (even more of a
collector’s piece than his recent mani-
festation as oracle of the Universities
Commission gods), let me answer his
questions.
Do I agree with the Commission’s
recommendation to the effect that
“financial support for adult education
activities (in universities) should cease
at the end of the 1967-69 triennium?”
No. As I said, at length.
Do I agree that universities should
offer “sub-standard” courses in adult
education? No. Neither do the uni-
versities. It is their business, and not
Mr. Badger’s or anyone else’s, to control
and judge the activities of their adult
education departments, and this they
do.
Do I agree that the Commonwealth
Government should institute an inquiry
to devise a national policy on adult
education? I suspect that Mr. Badger
is setting snares for careless feet here.
He knows that Senator Gorton has
wisely proposed that an inquiry should
be carried out, that the universities, the
States, and other appropriate bodies
concerned should be involved equally
with the Federal Government, and that
university adult educationists warmly
support the move. We believe that
nothing but good could come from such
consultations, that all educational
systems should be strenuously self-
critical. But does, I wonder, Mr. Badger
have a secret vision of an omnipotent
Federal tribunal? One which would act
as judge, jury, and executioner in the
universities and adult education case,
with Mr. Badger as First Gravedigger?
One which could override the wishes of
the universities and the States and cer-
tainly would not bother with the views
of the people most obviously involved
in this business, the public at large?
My answer is that I certainly agree
with the first idea of an inquiry. As
to the second, I don’t think democracies
breed such tribunals.
Let me ask Mr. Badger, as a last
word, one question. Does he think his
letters rubbishing past and present uni-
versity adult education in every paper
that will print him either help the cause


HIGHLIGHTS FROM NATIONAL BANK
CHAIRMAN’S 1966 ADDRESS
THE FINANCIAL OUTLOOK. My view is that the financial outlook in our country promises well
for the remainder of the financial year. Overseas the picture is more clouded with the dis-
turbing problem of a growing shortage of international liquidity threatening the orderly
growth of international trade. Full support should be given, therefore, to our own Federal
Treasurer’s strong plea, made late in September at the annual meeting of the Inter-
national Monetary Fund in Washington, for an early solution by the many nations con-
cerned and the provision, as may be necessary, of adequate financial resources to cope
with growing trade between the nations.
MONETARY POLICY AND BANKS AID BUSINESS. Over the year the Statutory Deposit Ratio was
reduced from 13.8% to its present 9.4%. The great part of this reduction was to support
trading bank, liquidity over a period of heavy rundown. However, a slightly higher
margin of “free” funds enabled additional lending especially necessary in the drought
stricken areas, and also more generally in view of the less buoyant trading conditions
which began to emerge last year. The result was that the trading banks were able to
extend an additional $227m. of credit over the year to September; the savings banks
also lent an additional $223m. It is not too much to claim that the large financial assist-
ance extended by the banking system has been a major factor in warding off what other-
wise might have developed into a business downturn.
REVIVAL OF CONFIDENCE IN BUSINESS NEEDED . Internal business is certainly not as buoyant
as it was a year ago and our overall growth rate would not appear to be as high as one
would like to see. While in such conditions it is difficult to predict the outcome, there is
no reason for thinking that we are about to commence a downward slide. Our post-war
experience shov/s that, in an overall sense, the “downs” will be only temporary, and,
today, every Australian would agree that our longer-term prospects are outstandingly
good. There have been individual business disasters but it is illogical and wrong to con-
clude from these unfortunate incidents that any general loss of confidence in business
and its future is warranted.
BANK OFFERS FULL RANGE OF LENDING SERVICES. By one means or another, the Bank is now
in a position to offer virtually a complete range of lending services, subject to the liquid-
ity limitations of the Reserve Bank. A wide range of short-term capital needs can be met
under our overdraft system. All types of commercial bill finance are available. Short-
term and medium-term business loans, and special purpose farm development loans,
are provided under our term lending system. Housing loans are provided by our Savings
Bank, and we are able to cater for mortgage loans, including long-term, instalment fin-
ance, and leasing arrangements.
MORE FLEXIBILITY TO BANKS HAS BIG ADVANTAGES. Recent changes, including the establish-
ment of the Term Loan Fund and the Farm Development Loan Fund and the approval
given by the Reserve Bank to enable trading banks, if they wish, to enter into personal
lending of the unsecured type, could be indicators of an important evolutionary change
in monetary policy which would afford the banking system greater flexibility of action.
This should enable it to regain some of the ground lost in recent years, thus widening
the area in which the Reserve Bank can influence and regulate credit policy and per-
mitting greater access to what is on average the cheapest source of finance.
ACCOUNTS. Net profit increased by $637,000 to $3,309,000; earnings having increased by
$2,680,000 and expenses plus taxation provisions by $2,043,000. An increase of sl24m.
brought consolidated balance sheet assets to over $ 1,265 m.

a great moment
for all
whisky
drinkers
Connoisseurs are aware of the vital part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why
not join in and enjoy a nip or two tonight? You’ll be
pleasantly surprised.

What Is “Racist”?
Sir,
In reply to “Anatomy of Warringah,”
by Sam Lipski (8., Nov. 26): it is
said that two groups, namely the “Aus-
tralian International News Review”
and a group known as the “50 Club,”
were responsible for the campaign
against Mr. E. St. John, the endorsed
Liberal candidate for Warringah. Mr.
Lipski states that one of the speakers
at the 50 Club was Mr. Eric Butler
of the “racist League of Rights.” What
does the use of the word racist imply
here? Does it mean a special claim
on superiority or does it mean simply
emphasis on the best in one’s national
heritage? I fail to comprehend how it
is a crime to foster one’s cultural heri-
tage. Why, may I ask, is there an
apparent double standard used between
European and non-European in the use
of the word?
Secondly, Mr. Lipski’s article makes
reference to speeches made by Mr. K.
Chambers and Mr. E. St. John at a
meeting of the Mosman 1 Apex Club.
May I point out that in the “Daily
Telegraph” of November 17 excerpts
of both candidates’ speeches were made.
I quote from Mr. Chambers’ speech:
“I wholly support the reasons given by
the Prime Minister for our present in-
volvement” (in Vietnam). Also “one
action which I firmly support to go
some way to providing relief to pen-
sioners is the removal of the means
test.” What may I ask is so extreme
about such statements? Mr. St. John
is quoted as having said, “I believe in
democracy, government for the people,”
etc., and is said to have reaffirmed his
opposition to the policies of the South
African Government. The first is a very
high-sounding phrase, but hardly applic-
able to Africa, where the tribal system
has dominated for centuries.

The Mortimer Case
Sir,
The article “The Case of Comrade
Mortimer” in your issue of December
3, over the name of Brian Buckley,
contains the sort of inaccuracies for
which this writer is well known. One
of these concerns me personally.
Mr. Buckley apparently works on the
principle that if he makes enough state-
ments about someone there is a chance
that he will be correct now and then.
To keep the record straight, he is
wrong again in his comment that I have
been working on draft papers for the
1967 Communist Party Congress, either
with Bernard Taft, John Sendy, or any-
body else.
DOUG WHITE
Clayton (Vic.)
Sir,
Philosopher Karl Popper once made
a devastating criticism of the theory
of “manifest truth,” which regards
certain propositions as so evidently true
that any doubt of them must be due to
the influence of some kind of devil. As
a variation on that theme, the “mani-
fest truth” about the Communist Party
which Mr. Buckley proclaims, holds that
there must always be a devil operating
in that organisation.
My colleagues and I have followed
with passing amusement the succession
of devils called upon by THE
BULLETIN and other publications
to perform that service for the allotted
span. I will do my stint with equanim-
ity. If facts are of any interest to Mr.
Buckley, I might inform him that a
main section of the draft papers for our
coming congress was proposed, unani-
mously, by a commission on which Rex
Mortimer and I both served.
The fact that I disagree with him
on some other issues, and that we

It took me two long hot
summers to realise it.”
“Those hot sticky summer days never
worried me. I was working in an air-
conditioned office. One day it sud-
denly dawned on me how miserable
it must be at home for my family dur-
ing the day — the house was even
hot when I arrived home at night.
We soon put everything right though
— with a Kelvinator Refrigerated
Room Air Conditioner in the house.”
It costs so little to relieve the misery
of summer heatwaves for your family.
(And you benefit, too — a nice cool
house to go home to at night.) A
Kelvinator Room Air Conditioner not
only cools but banishes humidity, be-
cause it is a refrigerated unit. Com-
pletely automatic it also ventilates,
exhausts stale air and smoke, circu-
lates and filters fresh air — and
provides the most economical method
of winter heating, too. All for just a
few cents a day!
If you work in air-conditioned com-
fort, remember the family at home —

RELIGIOUS IMMORALITY
sfa
86 Years Ago: December 18, 1880
ir pHE Legislature has, very properly,
provided a drastic enactment for
the suppression of obscene publica-
tions. The morals of the people re-
quire to be protected against the cal-
culating pruriency of any scoundrel
who hopes to turn a dirty penny by
thrusting his filthy thoughts, in print,
under the noses of every man or
woman, lad or girl, who passes along
the streets. But morality comprises
other virtues besides chastity of
thought and action. There is no
grosser immorality than inculcating
hatred of one’s neighbors. It is
worthy of attention of the new
Parliament that the Act passed last
session does not go half far enough.
There is no secular newspaper in
Sydney which approaches in immor-
ality of teaching the so-called religious
organs in inculcating hatred. Accord-
ing to the Papist papers all Protes-
tants are fools, their conversation a
thing to be avoided, their faith a
pernicious folly, and their founders
men of bad characters in their day.
The Protestant organs, on the other
hand, appear set upon convincing
Roman Catholics that all priests are
villains. They rave with a fury utterly
out of harmony with the humane
spirit of the age, and froth malice and
venom on all mankind outside their
own communion. The PROTES-
TANT STANDARD of last week fur-
nishes an apt illustration. Exulting
over the issue of the elections, after a
list of names, it prints, “here is a list
of twenty-one Papists slaughtered.”
Why “slaughtered,” of all expressions,
oh, ministers of the Gospel of Peace?
This is the language of Solomon
Islanders or Turkish Bashi Bazouks.
The people of Australia find no en-
joyment in this conception of inter-
necine massacre, which the reverend
editors evidently gloat upon. Aus-
tralians have no mania for avenging
St. Bartholomew’s Eve, or taking re-
prisals for the Battle of the Boyne.
If so-called “religious” papers per-
sist in teaching the immoral doctrine
of hating one’s neighbors, the pro-
visions of the Obscene Publications
Act will have to be sooner or later
extended so as to reach them.

Face of the Week
The Qantas strike went into its
third week with no resolution in
sight. Solo yachtsman Francis
Chichester reached Sydney at the
end of a 13,750-mile voyage from
England. Mt. Isa Mines gave its
employees increased prosperity load-
ings. Heavy rain fell in South Aus-
tralia, Victoria, N.S.W., and Queens-
land during the week. The captain
and navigator of H.M.A.S. Parra-
matta were reprimanded after a
court martial in Singapore for
hazarding the ship. At Cooktown, six
persons were gaoled for possession of
the drug marihuana. In light aircraft
accidents, three persons were injured
in a landing on a Perth oval and a
pilot almost struck a car in landing
on a road near Gosford, N.S.W. The
Victorian Police appointed a five-
man squad to combat violence and
hooliganism in Melbourne.

How to Pick a Leader
THERE were two political meet-
ings in Canberra last week
concerned with the question of
leadership —that of the Parliamen-
tary Country Party and the
Federal Executive of the ALP.
They formed an illuminating con-
trast. The Country Party replaced
its former 70-year-old Deputy
Leader, Mr. Adermann, with 36-
year-old Mr. Anthony. The transi-
tion was achieved with minimum
bitterness. Nobody had grievances
against Mr. Adermann; he has
worked loyally for the Country
Party and been a faithful under-
study, supporter of, and backstop
for his leader, John McEwen. But
the Party sensibly acknowledged
that, with Mr. McEwen, 66, and
Mr. Adermann, 70, the Party’s
leadership was moving into a vul-
nerable position and that if the
elevation of Mr. Anthony—young,
relatively untried, prone to all the
mistakes of youth, including inflexi-
bility— might be a risk, it was a
smaller risk than the possibility of
suddenly leaving the Party with
an inexperienced leadership.
Nobody jostled Mr. Adermann.
He is being left with his Primary
Industry portfolio and not reduced
immediately to the ranks. The
Party was given the choice between
two young men Mr. Anthony
and Mr. Sinclair, 37, the present
Minister for Social Services. Even
here, deliberate efforts were made
to reduce personal feelings and hurt
to a minimum. Two members
counted the votes and were asked
not to reveal the figures to their
colleagues and to burn the ballot
papers as soon as they had com-
pleted their count. All this reduced
any possible resentment by the
defeated candidate. The whole
episode simple enough in itself
—showed a strong and successful
Party that knew what it had to do.
Contrast this with the Federal
Executive of the Labor Party. It
assembled after the ALP’s worst
electoral set back in 35 years. Some
might have naively assumed that
the Executive would therefore
examine its problems from the
point of view of the Party’s long-
term interests, especially its failure
to attract young voters and the
popular repugnance provoked by
its policies of appeasement of Com-
munism at home and abroad. But
no such thing happened. It is not
a question of intelligence or talent.
The Labor Party still has its share
of these. (As Alan Reid has
claimed picturesquely, Mr. F. E.
“Joe” Chamberlain could outfox
most Liberals with one hand be-
hind his back, blindfolded, and
while taking afternoon tea and
eating a meat pie.) But, like other
defeated rabbles before it, it could
not acknowledge disaster and coolly
analyse the causes. Instead, each
faction bitterly blamed the othess;
or blamed any number of outside
groups from the Catholics to the
Protestants, from the Press to the
Unions; dodged any fundamental
question, such as the state of the
Victorian ALP or the Party’s age-
ing membership; and fell back on
intriguing to thwart or advance the
leadership ambitions of particular
individuals. The one thing it must
do—-purge its Leftists —it would
not do.
If the Labor Party is not to
continue as a rabble of sects (who-
ever becomes its “leader”), it could
usefully learn an object lesson in
the techniques of survival from the
Country Party. But, perhaps, the
ALP’s ultimate illusion is that it
is indestructible.


THIS AUSTRALIA
A Modem Drake
WITH the help of a 1000-page navigating manual published in 1839 and a
small pocket sextant captured from a German officer, Francis Chichester
flew from New Zealand to Australia. That was in 1931 in a Gipsy Moth
fitted with floats. The 1839 manual and 1 the sextant were necessary to find his two
refuelling points tiny islands in the Tasman.
So navigation should have been no
problem in his solo trans-Atlantic races
or in his voyage from Plymouth to
Sydney in Gipsy Moth IV, his 53ft.
ketch.
Five feet ten inches tall, with a spare
frame, if ever there was a modern
Drake it is he. At 18 he emigrated to
New Zealand working in the stoke-
hold for most of the voyage. There he
did many things: gold-digging, coal-
mining, farming, selling a farming
magazine, forestry there are a million
trees being harvested now that he
planted in the 1920 s and started an
aviation company although he couldn’t
fly.
At 27 he returned to England to
learn. Within six months he had bought
his own plane, learned to fly and navi-
gate it, and set out to beat the solo
record from England to Australia. (Only
Bert Hinkler had ever done the trip
solo before.) But he broke his propeller
in Africa and although he completed
the flight he didn’t get the record.
In 1930 he decided to fit floats to
his Gipsy Moth and try the first long-
distance solo seaplane flight. A year
later, having learned everything he
could about ' navigation and having
devised a few new techniques of his
own, he set out for New Zealand,
knowing that one error in his calcula-
tions would mean the end. At Lord
Howe Island a gale turned the plane
upside down and sank it.
In ten weeks, with the help of 120
islanders, he re-built the Moth and
finished the flight to Australia. But he
didn’t stop here. He headed north for
Japan, where an optimistic harbor-
master directed him in over the harbor
entrance, but unfortunately forgot the
telephone wires. They cut off one float
and catapulted the plane into the
harbor wall. The plane was a wreck
(he gave it away to the local grammar
school) and so was Francis Chichester.
He had 13 bones broken and it took
him five years to get over it.
When World War II broke out he
volunteered three times for the RAF
but was always turned down because of
his bad eyesight. He and his friends
offered themselves as a “commando”
squadron to go in and bomb special
targets in bad weather, but that too was
turned down. Eventually, the Air
Ministry did find a use for his talents
and he spent much of the war teaching
and devising new navigational tech-
niques.
When the war ended he started his
own firm, making jig-saw puzzles from
old maps. He soon found that maps
sold better than jig-saws, so he became
a map publisher rather by mistake. But
his firm became famous for its small
pocket maps.
He didn’t start sailing till 1953, when
he bought his first yacht, Gypsy Moth
11. In 1960 he won the first single-
handed trans-Atlantic yacht race and in
1962 he set a new record for a solo
east-west Atlantic crossing. He turned
65 in the Atlantic on his voyage from
Plymouth to Sydney in his attempt
to match the runs .of the wool-clippers
100 years ago.
Francis Chichester knows as well as
any man alive what it feels like to
be utterly alone and completely de-
pendent on his own brain and skill. “If
man,” he wrote 34 years ago “ever
flies alone out of the earth’s atmosphere
into space —to the moon —though he
returns safely he will not ‘live.’ The
awful emptiness of space will change
his soul and isolate it. Never again
will he be able to make contact with
man, beast, plant, or anything. Perhaps
the soul, belonging to -space, will have
recognised its home and languish in
utter loneliness for it until, loosening its
hold on the body, it floats back again.”

cover is by Alex King.
The Route
Francis Chichester followed a route
first opened up early in the 17th cen-
tury by the Dutch caravels bound for
Java and later made famous by Dirck
Hartog, Abel Tasman, the First Fleet,
and the wool clippers.
In the 16th century mariners had
hugged the East Coast of Africa and
Madagascar. Then about 1600 one
adventurous captain (name uncertain)
continued south from the Cape, picked
up the trade .winds, and made a re-
cord trip across the Indian Ocean,
turning north for Java at the right
longitude. Inevitably some adventurers
following the same route overshot the
longitude and were the first white men
to discover and land on the west coast
of Australia. The first recorded ship
to do this was the Endracht, skippered
by Dirck Hartog, who left a pewter
plate recording his visit on an island
in Shark Bay, Western Australia, in
1616.
Abel Janszoon Tasman sailed south
from Mauritius in 1642 to pick up
the gales in the ’forties for his voyage
through “high seas, dense fog, dark-
ness, and intense cold” in which he
discovered the tip of Tasmania and
part of New Zealand’s coast before
sailing round Australia without seeing
any more of it.
In 1787-88, the 11 ships of the First
Fleet lumbered over the course
Chichester has just followed, taking
eight months and one day to cover
15,063 miles. Transports and naval
ships followed in their hundreds. Some
were wrecked, like the storeship
Guardian, which, making south to pick
up the trade winds, ran on an iceberg.

Flinders of the Bass Strait in 1798,
the route to Sydney, just followed by
Chichester, was shortened. The Strait
was treacherous to any ship under sail,
and King Island quickly won the
reputation of a graveyard of ships.
The golden age of the Chichester
route came with the clippers, the sleek,
graceful fliers with which America and
Britain fought for the sea trade of the
world. The discovery of gold in Aus-
tralia built up the fierce competition
as the money-spinning clippers brought
gold hunters out and returned packed
with wool from Australia or tea from
China and not a little gold.
Clipper trade was so profitable that
no fewer than five British firms, based
on Blackwall (London), Aberdeen, and
Boston, were soon building and oper-
ating clippers built of teak and superior
to their American soft-wood rivals.
Picking up the trade winds in the
Roaring Forties, the Thompson Line
clipper Thermopylae completed the
trip from London to Melbourne in
1875 in 60 days, compared with the
140 days of the pre-clipper age. In
doing this she broke the 20-year record
of 63 days set in 1854 by the Black
Ball clipper James Baines.
Not even the famous Cutty Sark
could tumble Thermopylae from the
championship. Cutty Sark could not do
better than 64 days.
There was much grim rejoicing when
the clipper Marco Polo completed the
voyage to Australia in 63 days, beating
the steamer Australia by a week. These,
of course, were the days of tough
skippers.
Marco Polo was commanded by Cap-
tain James Nicol Forbes, who quickly
earned the title “Bully” Forbes and re-
joiced in it.
Before his first trip to Australia with
900 goldseekers and other immigrants
in 1852, he boasted he would make
Melbourne and return in six months.
His friends laughed at him. They did
not know “Bully” Forbes.
He drove his ship and his crew
mercilessly, running before gales in the
Roaring Forties at the phenomenal
speed of 20 knots. When the crew
panicked and lowered the sails he
stormed on deck, had them raised, and
ordered them to be padlocked in posi-
tion. To terrified passengers who
begged him to reduce sail, he bellowed,
“Hell or Melbourne.” “Bully” Forbes
fulfilled his prophecy. He was back in
Liverpool within five months and 21
days. Apart from general cargo, he
had $200,000 worth of gold dust aboard
and a 340-ounce nugget for Queen
Victoria.
At the masthead she flew a pennant
bearing the words “the Fastest Ship
in the World.”
Lightning was another champion
clipper. She set a record by running
436 nautical miles in 24 hours, and
raced from Melbourne round the Horn
to Liverpool in 63 days, a record that
still stands for wind-driven ships.
WILLIAM JOY
Landfall off Gabo
Of course, it was ridiculous that a 65-year-old man in a yacht was beating hell
out of Bass Strait while every newspaper in Melbourne, with staffs permanently on
the alert, could not get anywhere near him. It became a sort of game eventually —-
“Chichester chasing.”
As soon as Francis Chichester started
his incredible duel with Bass Strait,
he was Melbourne’s property. We were
going to get all the dope on him before
Sydney.
The only trouble was we couldn’t lay
our eyes on him. It was as though the
powers that be specially ordered the
heavy storm that battered Gipsy Moth
IV for five days and the low cloud
that prevented our spotter planes sight-
ing the sea, let alone Chichester.
Not to worry, on Sunday evening a
cadet reporter spotted him from the air
during a lucky break in the clouds.
And we in Victoria had the pleasure of
getting our first glimpse of the 53-foot
ketch and her master. However, the
big search was now becoming a cut-
throat business.
We had our men posted at Lakes
Entrance to waylay the sailor as he
drifted past. Our spies in spotter planes
reported his agonisingly slow progress
almost hourly. Chichester was heading
for Gabo Island, off Mallacoota, and
just inside the Victorian border. Then
came the sorry news. The Sydney
newspapers had descended on Eden.
Reports filtered through of what they
were organising in the way of boats,
aircraft, telephones, picturegram units,
fast cars. It was all very worrying.
There we were, sitting in Lakes
Entrance, surely the wettest bit of land
in Victoria, and there was a water
shortage. In fact, for 24 hours we had
no water at all. The town’s supply was
cut off because the ground beside the
reservoir at Jemmy’s Point, just outside
the town, collapsed and broke the 9in.
mainline water pipe.
The official excuse was that the
heavy recent rains there had caused the
damage. But sabotage is not beyond
the bounds of possibility. It’s not far
along the Prince’s Highway from Eden
to Lakes Entrance . . . anyway, come
first light on Wednesday morning and
the battle was on. A flotilla of fishing
trawlers, resembling something left
over from the Spanish Armada, shot
over the bar at Lakes Entrance.
Already those Sydney newshounds had
set off from Eden.
Meanwhile, the unshaven, unshowered,
and unwashed Victorian contingent was
guided by spotter planes from Bairns-
dale airport. And the no doubt beauti-
fully laundered Sydney mob were
steaming somewhere around the Tas-
man Sea. Actually, we all made it to
Chichester within three hours of each
other.
The first boat on the scene was, in
fact, a Sydney chartered trawler. But
in no time at all a second trawler with
Melbourne cargo on board managed
to get close enough to bump thfe Gipsy
Moth. Chichester’s yell of “bloody
Sunday drivers” summed up the chaos.
But after this nautical Press con-
ference was over we were all so re-
lieved that we even let the Sydney
mob file their stories from our own
Lakes Entrance. And we allowed them
to take a shower. The water was
back on.

Outdoors Order
Moves are under way in Victoria to
formulate some sort of State-wide
uniform code to control all forms of
outdoor advertising. If the final code
dovetails with One also under discussion
now in New South Wales, the two States
will at last look like bringing some order
out of the proliferation of out-of-doors
advertising.
In Melbourne, the Local Govern-
ment Minister, Mr. Hamer, is organ-
ising a special committee to investigate
this industry and recommend plans for
some more orderliness in it. Last year,
$21,559,000 was spent in outdoor adver-
tising by and through members of the
association. This figure does not include
the works and effort of non-members.
There are 209 local councils in Vic-
toria and all are empowered under
Local Government legislation to make
by-laws regulating or prohibiting out-
door advertising. But only if they want
to. Most have put through various types
of bv-laws, but there has never been
any tendency toward uniformity.
As against all this, in certain areas
and on certain streets, there are other
authorities that come into it: the Board
of Works, the R»ad Traffic Commission,
the Country Roads Board, and town
planning authorities.
“Sometimes it can take one of our
members up to seven months to get
approval from a group of these bodies
to put up an ad,” says the Federal Dir-
ector of the Outdoor Advertisers 5
Association, Lionel Bosworth.
BUT aesthetics will surely come into
it. The Minister’s committee will be
chaired by a member of his own
department and its members will be
representatives of all the bodies con-
cerned.
That some sort of code, if not some
stringent curbing, whether only of
“snipers” or not, is desirable is some-
thing clear to anyone who ventures on
any highway today. The committee will
look at everything that advertises any-
thing out of dobrs: signs, hoardings,
posters, neon signs.
I showed Mr. Bosworth a copy of
the Institute of Architects’ recent pub-
lication on our kerbside waywardness,
“Australian Outrage.” He expressed
agreement with its general sentiments:
“We do support a clean-up,” he said.
But he couldn’t go all the way with
J. D. Pringle’s admonitions.
In the book, Pringle wrote: “Adver-
tising on roads is parasitic, living off a
public investment the road with-
out rendering a valid public service in
return.”
Bosworth said, “That’s wrong. Out-
door advertising renders a great public
service and has a distinctly accepted
place in the advertising field. It in-
forms the public helpfully and is in
great demand by all major advertisers.
After all, it’s the oldest form of adver-
tising, you know.”

Executive
Ticket
Threats that other State executives
of the Labor Party and a Whitlam-led
Federal Caucus (by no means certain at
any stage) may combine in the New
Year to expel and replace the Victorian
Labor Party executive have so far
tended to consolidate the power of the
organisation which runs the Victorian
ALP, the Trade Union Defence Com-
mittee.
This organisation was formed at the
time of the ALP split in 1955 to prevent
the forces which later formed the
Democratic Labor Party from “infil-
trating” the ALP again. In the early
days power was shared by Left Wing
union leaders and moderate leaders
such as Bill Divers (now an ML A) and
“Bramer” Davis, of the AWU.
As the “Grouper” forces consolidated
into the DLP and the threat of “infil-
tration” from that side faded, the
moderate unions gradually lost interest
in the TUDC and it was taken over
by the active promoters of unity tickets
and Communist fronts. As its attitudes
became more pro-Communist, its power
also grew over the Victorian State ALP,
at the expense of the non-Communist
unions and the branches.
In a few years the TUDC was
choosing the most popular ticket for the
election of ALP office bearers. Now no
ALP members stands a chance of elec-
tion to an official position in the Vic-
torian ALP unless he is TUDC chosen.
The chief operator of the TUDC is
Percy Johnson, former secretary of the
Blacksmiths’ Union and now an
organiser of the Boilermakers’ Society.
His chief assistants are Bill Brown,
once a member of the industrial
group in the Furnishing Trades Union
and now president of the Vic-
torian ALP, Bill Hartley, once a
member of a University Liberal Club
and now secretary of the Victorian ALP,
George Crawford, secretary of the ex-
treme-Left Plumbers’ Union, Bert
Noland, of the Communist-led Sea-
men’s Union, and Ted McCormick, of
the Waterside Workers’ Federation.
At the annual meeting of the TUDC,
which chooses the ticket for the ALP
executive, there are usually about 34
delegates present from some 17 unions.
The basic tests for membership are will-
ingness to work with Communists for
so-called “militant” industrial ends and
a neutralist or pro-Communist foreign
policy. During the rest of the year the
TUDC is normally run on a gentle-
men’s agreement basis by the officials
previously named.
One of the ludicrous features of the
TUDC is that, although its members
are all in the ALP and nearly half are
on the State executive, there is an
underlying tension between pro-
Peking/pro-Moscow factions. Allegi-
ance is partly determined by private
politics and partly by the attitudes of
Communist officials in the unions of
the TUDC members concerned. Signs
of this ideological tension are evident
in the TUDC paper “Scope” and in
annual sackings and promotions in the
drawing up of the ticket for the ALP
executive. There are, of course, TUDC
members who have little interest in the
Sino-Soviet split and whose politics are
pro-Communist only in a general way.
Recently there have been signs of a
more serious split. Some of the less
ideological members of the Defence
Committee are finding ALP electoral
defeats too much to tolerate and be-
lieve that Victoria is suffering politi-
cally and industrially from the fact
that it is the only State in which the
leaders of the local Trades Hall
Council are not represented on the
State ALP executive. At a secret meet-
ing of the TUDC to select the ALP
executive last June, president Bill
Brown moved that as in the past
a committee of 13 be elected to choose
the list of names for endorsement. Bob
Brebner and former Communist Geoff
McDonald opposed the motion.
The Johnson majority won the vote,
but at another meeting a few weeks


later McDonald, whilst congratulating
the Victorian executive on its work for
the year and deploring any attempt
to depose it, suggested that the numbers
on the Victorian executive be increased
to allow a ticket to be presented to the
ALP annual conference which would
include officials of the Trades Hall
Council and more representatives of
the Party branches.
In the fierce debate which followed,
Bill O’Brien, of the Railways Union,
described the motion as a “dangerous
trap,” and Bert Nolan, of the Sea-
men’s (both Communist - controlled
unions), also deplored the attempt to
create disunity amongst the working
classes. Unions which supported the
motion included the Theatrical Em-
ployees’, the Butchers’, and the
Municipal Workers’, but the motion
was defeated.
The recent threats of counter-action
by Gough Whitlam, the N.S.W.
executive, and the moderate Labor
“shadow executive” have tended to
strengthen the internal position of the
pro-Communist leadership of the
TUDC.
The committee is girding its num-
bers for a fight in the New Year and
at the same time adopting a wary
attitude toward the problem of Federal
parliamentary leadership. If necessary,
it is prepared to drop Dr. Cairns as
its candidate for Opposition Leader
and support a compromise ticket
which would dissolve possibility of
action against the Victorian executive.
At present the most favored com-
promise partnership is that of Frank
Crean and Fred Daly for ALP Leader
and Deputy-Leader in the House of
Representatives.
Victoria’s University Siege
There are no more ivory towers in Victoria. In one extraordinary week die
universities have suffered more public attack than in the previous generation.
The attack appears to have been
spontaneous and it has come from
the Liberal Party, the Country Party,
and the Labor Party. The realisation
by politicians, after the last election,
that the academic Left and its exhibi-
tionistic fringe of student demonstra-
tions has little or no public influence
or support may have something to do
with the case.
The siege of the academies began
with an assault from the Left flank.
The deputy leader of the Labor
Opposition in the Legislative Assembly,
Mr, Lovegrove, said that he wished to
raise a matter “arising from two re-
cent incidents and ask how far the
Government and the taxpayers should
tolerate bad or anti-social behaviour
from university students.”
Mr. Lovegrove went on to abuse
“those student hooligans with too much
money and no manners or graces” who
involved President Johnson in “the
most disgraceful incident in the history
of Australia ... as a member of
the Melbourne University Council, the
Government should carefully examine
the behaviour of some of these students
and the university should be told to
get rid of them.” .
“As a taxpayer, I have the strongest
objection to paying for the higher
education of educated louts who are a
disgrace to this country.”
The point of the attack was then
somewhat blunted by the Minister for
Education, Mr. Bloomfield, who re-
ferred to “uncouth, unwashed, undesir-
able, unkempt, uncultured, and unpro-
fitable people in our universities.”
Then followed a bitter burst of fire
from Mr. Mitchell of the Country
Party, who alleged that a number of
young people had been “got at by
present and former members of the
Communist Party, filled up with beer
and urged to make demonstrations. I
believe such people are only at the
University through the utter weakness
and dereliction of duty of Sir George
Paton (Vice-Chancellor).” A few days
later Mr. Mitchell returned to the
attack with another outburst against
the Vice - Chancellors of both Mel-
bourne and Monash Universities,
Despite the intemperate attacks of
Mr. Mitchell, one sensed, both in
Parliament and the electorate at large,
emerging forces of anti-academic
populism, but they may have been
stemmed by a speech delivered in the
Lower House by 30-year-old Mr. Brian
Dixon, a former university lecturer,
who chose his targets with precision,
Mr. Dixon first charged Mr. Mitchell
with making “a premeditated and cold-
blooded attack” on the Vice-Chancel-
lors. “I believe the honorable member
for Benambra has brought disrepute,
dishonor, disdain, and derision, pri-
maril Y upon himself, but also upon this
House and upon those to whom we
express our loyalty during this Address-
in-Reply debate.”
Mr. Dixon also defended the con-
science of William White before laying
the blame for many student political
attitudes at the feet of those whom he
felt were really responsible, the Left-
wing academics.
Mr. Dixon said: “I refer to the Left-
wing background and, to some extent,
the Left-wing activities of a fairly sub-
stantial number of the members of the
staffs of universities in Victoria. I wish
to make it clear that I believe these
people have a perfect right to dissent
and to undertake their particular politi-
cal beliefs so long as they do not im-
pinge upon academic freedom and so
long as they do not use undue influ-
ence.”
Mr. Dixon explained the history of
the Australian Academic Left Estab-
lishment: “This atmosphere was first
noticeable perhaps in the 1930 s and
19405, when, of course, there existed
a depressed atmosphere in this State
and many people, because of economic
necessity, were very much attracted
to the Left way of thinking. Indeed, be-
cause of this situation, it was not sur-
prising that academics, who are among
the leaders in trying to develop a more
progressive and a better type of society,
should be among the Left-wingers who
wanted to try to remove some of the
repercussions of the depression. These
people exerted a marked influence at
the University of Melbourne. Their
influence was just not in terms of im-
proving the society in which we live;
it had repercussions on staffing appoint-
ments, and those repercussions can be
felt today.
“Two of the most significant inci-
dents occurred in 1946 and in 1949. In
1946, a distinguished man called
Kerensky, who was the Prime Minister
of Russia prior to the Bolshevik take-
over, was refused a position at Mel-
bourne University. He came to Australia
in 1940 and applied unsuccessfully for
the positions that were available. In
1946, Kerensky took up residence in the
United States of America. It is inter-
esting to note that one of the persons
a Professor Milner appointed to
a position which possibly would have
been suitable for Mr. Kerensky, took a
position in the Department of External
Affairs and subsequently defected to
the Soviet Union.
“Franz Borkenau, a distinguished
academic, who is one of the best ex-
posers of the Communist International,
and who is the author of several
books, including Spanish Cockpit,
Austria and After, and Socialism,
National or International, was also
unable to obtain a position at the Mel-
bourne University. The position was
subsequently filled and it is still occu-
pied by Professor McMahon Ball.”
Mr. Dixon also referred to the Knop-
felmacher case at Sydney, and the
appointment of a man from a Com-
munist college in Prague to the Chair
of Japanese at Monash. He instanced
two cases where he claimed political
pressure had been brought to bear on
junior staff members, and then struck
some terror into the hearts of academia
by calling for a Royal Commission into
university administration and appoint-
ments so that that academic freedom
may be preserved from “political job-
bery.”
The danger the academic Left faces
is heightened by the fact that the
charges of Mr. Dixon cannot be dis-
missed as the ramblings of a Right-wing
extremist. Mr. Dixon defended both
the Vice-Chancellors and William
White in his speech, and he is well
known for anti-Establishment views on
education and finance. There is also a
heavy weight of public opinion calling
the universities to account.
However the former Chancellor of
the University of Melbourne (1954-66),
Sir Arthur Dean later commented that
the statements of Mr. Brian Dixon,
MLA “at present appear to be founded
on utterly false information.”

As the Qantas Strike Widens
A grey-haired tourist' from Bradenton, Florida, stood impatiently in the lobby
of a down-town Sydney hotel. He threw his sports coat open, hooked his thumbs*
over his belt, and stared disconsolately at the rain. “We’ve been waiting six davs to
get out of here,” he said with disgust. “Every day they tell us To be on calt but
nothing ever happens; I’m getting B "dred of Wyi g solitaire.”
The American, part of an 18-member
tour party, was to have left Australia
on December 2. His flight was cancelled
when the 426 Qantas pilots went on
strike. He is one of scores of travellers
who have been waiting for seats on
other airlines as the strike entered its

December 18 to 24, the peak period
for trans-Tasman traffic, some 9400
bookings have already been made.
Normally, there are 13,200 seats avail-
able on BOAC, Air New Zealand, and
Qantas. With Qantas on strike, that
number has been reduced to 6800. This
means at least 2600 people with reserva-
tions may not be crossing the Tasman
for the holidays. Another 600 to 1000
who did not make bookings will likewise
not be crossing.
After the passengers (and Qantas

week), the next to suffer from the
strike were Qantas employees. At
the end of the second week, 3685
Qantas employees had been stood down
3347 in Sydney offices and at Mascot,
108 elsewhere in Australia, and 230
overseas.
The next were Qantas suppliers and
air-freight agents. In ever-widening
circles, the strike began touching busi-
nesses that use air freight, and finally
the worker whose job temporarily halted
because of lack of supplies.
Fifteen suppliers make a total of 100
deliveries a day normally to Qantas
headquarters at Mascot; another 80
deliver during an average month. These
supplies range from meat and poultry to
wine, biscuits, and fuel oil.
Qantas normally spends $43,500 a
month for passenger food and $22,000
for ground catering at Mascot and
other Sydney offices. In the early days
of the strike, suppliers would not say
how much they were losing and only
that “we have not stood down staff yet.”
Small suppliers have been able to find
alternate customers, but their situation
could worsen if the strike continues
after Christmas.
Air-freight agents who normally
Qantas 60 to 80 percent of the time are
even more seriously affected. As in the
case of passenger bookings, agents were
able to get goods in and out of the
country on other airlines early in the
strike. But as the strike continues, even
these channels are beginning to fill up
as more goods backlog on either end.
South-bound cargo from the Northern
Hemisphere is being held back by at
least one airline in deference to mail
normally carried by Qantas. Even with
this, some mail is being delayed 24 to
48 hours because of transhipment.
“I’ve got a customer screaming for
parts for a tractor for use in the wheat
harvest,” one agent said. “We have
freight backed up in Singapore, New
Zealand, Honolulu, Manila, Los
Angeles, and San Francisco just waiting
for space on incoming flights.”
His averages 5000 ship-
ments a month from the United States,
Europe, and the Far East. This has
now been more than halved. “On top
of the Philippine pilots’ strike and the
American airlines’ strike, we’ve just
about had it.”
Customers are equally unhappy about
the situation. The director of a record-
changing manufacturing and assembly
plant believes he may have to lay off
threequarters of his 80-man staff unless
consignments of record-changer cart-
ridges come in soon. Two consignments
are tied up someplace between here and
London, as is one half of the third. The
other half is now in Sydney. He esti-

Qantas is able to recoup some of its
financial losses, it will be a long time
before the company’s image can be re-
stored to its former position. People
such as the grey-haired man from
Florida will now look less respectfully

be attributed to the teamwork and
efficiency of its employees.”

Insurance against Hatred
By J. HORNER
The attractive young Aboriginal woman who had been eating in a Brisbane
restaurant paid her bill and left. An elderly white lady customer suddenly insisted
to the management that the girl had stolen some money. Two police officers met
the girl at the door of her suburban flat and informed her of this accusation. As
her purse did not establish her innocence she would certainly have been charged
had not a telephone call to the president of a women’s association (to which she
belonged) confirmed her good character.
This happened seven years ago. It
illustrates perfectly the hidden
malevolence of racial discrimination.
There was no protection for the person
discriminated against. The restaurant
manager and the two policemen were
in duty bound to pursue the old lady’s
claims. Had they firmly pressed the
charge, a fair-minded magistrate might
have censured them, since the accusa-
tion was the figment of a wicked
person’s mind. But who was to know
that? The evidence favored neither
the girl nor the lady, and the police-
men had to be convinced that the old
lady had told lies from hate.
Mr. Don Dunstan, who is both
Attorney-General and Minister for
Aboriginal Affairs in the new South
Australian Government, sponsored the
new Prohibition of Discrimination Act
which became law this month and which
he hopes will give some of our in-
tolerant habits the old one-two. It loads
a $2OO fine upon anyone who, for racial
reasons, is clearly preventing a service
to anyone in a public place. The people
who own, or hold licences in, hotels,
restaurants, theatres, and public trans-
port are expected to see there is every
civility shown to colored people among
their customers. This is not as unreason-
able a law as it looks; there are very
good reasons why legislation of this kind
can act as a good educative influence
to change our public behaviour.
Today prejudice rarely takes the
form of criminal assault or civil
slander, which can be exposed in the
courts. It is rather a subtle thing. A
fastidious hospital patient may keep
up a pretence that a colored nurse is
incompetent. Local councillors may put
the municipal swimming-pool out of
bounds to Aboriginal or Islander
people. A hairdresser may refuse to
cut their hair; a cafe proprietor may
refuse to serve them meals. How does
a person fight this? The only natural
defence for not being served in a public
place is psychological a spirited
show of blazing anger, arising from an
affront to one’s self-esteem. This some-
times works. All the examples cited
here have actually happened in Aus-
tralia: all of them, humanly speaking,
are abominable, yet they are quite
legal. A healthy public opinion is the
only restraining influence. People have
also been refused insurance by great
insurance companies, refused accom-
modation by anonymous landladies,
overcharged at lonely stores, sent out-
side a milkbar to drink a milkshake.
It is all considered legal.
(There are two common exceptions.
Innkeepers and common carriers must
extend to travellers no matter who
they are the courtesy • of the road.
This is illustrated by a well-known
legal case, Constantine v. Imperial
Hotel Ltd. (1944), in which Sir Learie
Constantine, who is, of course, a West
Indian, was to play an international
cricket match at Lord’s, and booked his
family and himself for four nights at
the hotel. The manager of the hotel,
fearing that his American Army clien-
tele WQuld cause ructions, threatened
to put them into the street. The Con-
stantine family left the premises.
Later Judge Birkett awarded Sir
Learie full damages.)
The Courts hold in high respect a
notion of ‘‘complete freedom of com-
merce,” including freedom not to en-
gage in commerce with anyone. For our
purpose, this means that the private
owner of a public service may refuse
to serve anyone he pleases. In very
definite terms, Judge Lennox, in an
Ontario (Canada) legal case,. Franklin
v. Evans (1947), said: “It can hardly
be argued that the proprietor of a
departmental store cannot legally jus-
tify his arbitrary refusal to sell to a
particular applicant, although osten-
sibly ready to sell to all who
may apply.”

In N.S.W. in conjunction with ALBERT P. BARNCASTLE PTY. LTD., SYDNEY
come from a Judge, against the infer-
ences of white supefiority in the “free-
dom of commerce” doctrine, was made
by Judge O’Halloran in a Court of
Appeal case in British Columbia,
Rogers v. Clarence Hotel Co. Ltd.
(1940). The details are not relevant;
an Indian, I think, was refused service
by a barman. The Judge’s minority
arguments were three: first, that all
British subjects have the same rights
and privileges under the common law,
whether white or colored; secondly,
that all inns, alehouses, and similar
public places “hold out” an open invi-
tation to the public, which cannot be
revoked; thirdly, that public houses,
though privately owned, are “affected
by a public interest,” owing to the
provincial legislation then in force
governing the sale of liquor. Judge
O’Halloran took the view, in dissent
from his brother Judges in appeal, that
the law holds valid the idea that all
races be served in public houses, sub-
ject to good public behaviour. This
is good common sense that you or I
would hold to: but it seems that in
putting forward his quoted precedents
Judge O’Halloran was hopefully
stretching the meaning of the British
law.
To Australian's, Islanders and the
Aborigines especially, who have bitter
memories of the country towns that, in
days gone, by, protested against their
accommodation in houses, or demanded
segregated primary schools, any un-
favorable discrimination is a standing
disgrace. There were even cases of hos-
pitals that protested about having to
take colored patients, and of clergy-
men who did not allow colored people
to attend their church services! In 1945,
it was seriously suggested to the
N.S.W. Chief Secretary that there
should be a separate Aboriginal Hospi-
tal on the North Coast to save other
country hospitals the bother of taking
native patients. The brazen cheek of
it! The most common form of segrega-
tion, and it was a habit that clung
even to towns not otherwise concerned
with the color bar, was to rope people
off in cinemas. Here and there, this
roping-off could also occur in churches.
S° the South Australian Parliament
is right to set up a new civil right.
The alternative possibility, supposing
an individual has a clear case of racial
humiliation, is to go to court. What
is the logic of this course? Is it a
tortious act to rope some people off
in a cinema? Or to refuse to serve
them in a restaurant? Socially it is
humiliating, like sending a man to
Coventry; but what is it in law? So
far our judges are disposed to feel that
a businessman can refuse business to
anyone he pleases, on the general
principle of “freedom of commerce,”
and this has yet to be seriously chal-
lenged. The real purpose of Mr. Dun-
stan’s Act is so simple as to be easily
overlooked: it is to protect the person
who is discriminated against.
If the proprietor of a boarding-
house or restaurant genuinely feels that
his white clientele will leave him if
he does not order a colored person into
the street, then his business is subject
to the constraint of irrational raciaL
prejudice: His livelihood largely de-
pends on the goodwill of the majority
of his customers. But Mr. Dunstan’s-
Act, since it makes the active expression,
of this prejudice a criminal offence,,
frees any proprietor from taking an.
invidious and unjust choice. The possi-
bility that local white prejudice may
bring ruin to his business, naturally-
a strong thought with him, cannot then
outweigh the greater obligation to offer
his hospitality or service to a genuine
customer. The statutory law overcomes-
the pressure that local and irrational
fears bring to his lawful business: the-
law of the land strengthens the pro-
prietor’s disposition to goodwill. Of
course, if he hasn’t that disposition —-
if he really hates the man for his-
color —■' the law enforces goodwill
from him. This would be a rare case;
though I have seen something similar.

was not accepted in Salisbury. The
South African Prime Minister, Mr.

the sanctions included an oil em-
bargo a British-South African
economic confrontation would
follow. .
OVERSEAS
Johnson’s Turn Next?
By ANTHONY HOWARD
The British Government’s request to the Security Council for the imposition of
mandatory sanctions against Rhodesia confronts President Johnson with a serious
domestic political dilemma. Under the UN participation Act passed by Congress
in 1945, tike President is required to report to both the House and the Senate any
action taken under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
But that by itself will not throw the
whole force of American law behind
any formal embargo on U.S. imports
from Rhodesia. So far, imports from
Rhodesia, in contrast ta America’s
own exports (banned under executive
order), have been purely a matter of
voluntary boycott, a boycott which
inevitably has been subject to bad
breaches, particularly in the area of
raw materials like chrome ore.
If the President now wishes to
tighten the sanctions screws thereby
showing African nations that his sup-
port for their cause is not just token
but practical as well he has no
alternative but to ask Congress for
Ian Smith
the other side which are every bit as
formidable: Dean Rusk, the Secretary
of State, is scarcely a champion of
American involvement in Africa. Nor,
for that matter, is the entire Treasury
Department which remains fearful
that any UN-provoked confrontation
with South Africa must eventually
mean the U.S. once again being asked
to bail Britain out of fresh economic
difficulties.
Among the President’s political ad-
visers there is in addition a lively
consciousness that, with Britain doing
nothing to help America in Vietnam,
the cause of coming to Mr. Wilson’s
rescue over Rhodesia is scarcely likely
to pass unchallenged, either by the
opposition party, the Republicans, or—
for that matter —by Southern segration-
ists within the Democratic Party.
Perhaps, however, the weightiest ar-
gument with the President in reaching
any decision over whether to give the
mandatory sanctions campaign the force
of law within the U.S. will be the
views of American businessmen
representing a national political con-
stituency that no President can afford
to ignore.
In this respect there is an especial
complication in the case of LBJ. It is
not just that—perhaps because he
served his political apprenticeship in
Texas he has always paid a scrupu-
lous respect to the views of the busi-
ness community: even more to the
point in the present instance is his per-
sonal friendship with one of the wealth-
iest man in the whole of America,
Charles Engelhard, the chairman of
Rand Mines, who also serves as the
only American to sit on the boards of
such South African organisations as the
Native Labour Association and the
Native Recruiting Corporation.
Engelhard often rumored to be
a model for lan Fleming’s “Goldfinger”
may be a figure little known to the
public except in Africa (where his mere
presence as an official American Rep-
resentative at the Zambian indepen-
dence celebrations in 1964 provoked a
storm of protest from African National-
ists), but there is an unmistakable ap-
prehension, not least on the African
desk of the State Department, that in
the next few days he will turn out to be
the most powerful voice whispering in
the President’s ear.
If that does prove to be the case,
legislation making any form of trade
with Rhodesia an illegal activity. The
machinery of Presidential executive
order is not applicable to imports.
For any U.S. President this would
be an extreme step, and for one who
once described the countries of
Africa as “suburbs” it is also probably
an unlikely one. Nevertheless, there
are clearly elements within the adminis-
tration who would be in favor of it.
There has never, for example, been
any doubt of the total commitment
of the United States’ Ambassador at
the UN, Arthur Goldberg, to the
cause of defeating the Smith regime:
and even within the White House the
President’s most influential special
assistant, Bill Moyers, has, ever since
his Peace Corps days, been an uncom-
promising champion of African aspira-
tions.

The Brink of Famine
By CYRIL DUNN
We were standing on the bed of a bone-dry reservoir outside a village called
Sonia, in south Bihar. All round us men, women, and children were digging
holes 10ft. square and a foot deep and carrying the hard earth in headbaskets
to the top, of the earth dam.
They were working on a famine
relief job designed for them by the
Sub-Divisional Officer and were getting
18c a hole with which to buy an un-
certain daily ration of coarse grain
four ounces for grown-ups and two
ounces for children. The Bihar Chief
Minister himself thinks this ration is
scandalous and would like to see the
rest of India cut its consumption for
Bihar’s benefit.
Nobody on the famine relief job at
Sonia looked gay and I asked the
gloomiest of them a thin young man,
pallid with sickness who he thought
was to blame for his present condition.
“Who is to blame except the Sirkar
the Government?” he said.
The young man doesn’t belong to that
army of landless laborers in south Bihar
who, without the Government’s relief
work, would have nothing whatever to
keep them alive. He farms seven acres,
and in this part of the world that puts
him in the top ten percent. But when
last summer the monsoon failed over
Bihar, it killed off the whole of his rice
crop and left even the paddy so
withered he couldn’t feed it to his bul-
locks. He grew a little maize in the
first illusory rains, but in a week or so
that will be gone.
There must be thousands more hover-
ing on the brink of the same plight.
In these southern districts of Bihar
the landscape of crop failure on the
small rice fields looks like an enormous
dump of tennis courts, all long dis-
used, bare, and cracked. And most of
them have produced nothing, or next
to nothing. With a general election less
than three months away, it seemed
logical to ask the disgruntled young
hole-digger how he would vote. “For
Congress,” he said, naming the party
with a majority in the Bihar Assembly
even mightier than it has under Mrs.
Indira Gandhi in the Delhi Parliament.
Then another peasant with a wide,
black moustache chipped in to say
sententiously that a man did not turn
away from the father and mother who
had cared for him for years simply
because at one time they failed.
Even so, here on the ground it doesn’t
look as if the Bihar Congress is really
well poised to cope with the disaster
looming ahead. It is riven into three
hostile 'pieces, each of which coincides
precisely with one of the three highest
Hindu castes in the State. And in the
worst-afflicted areas of south Bihar the
political layout seems even less reliable.
The scene is still dominated by the
local Rajah, who lives amid the barren
tennis courts in a palace built 30 years
ago in the Mogul style. When the Rajah
and the Chief Minister are at home
they are neighbors and have been bitter
enemies for years, the Rajah being of
the Rajput caste and the Minister a
Kyasth. The Rajah has tried in a wide
range of ways,to unseat the Chief Min-
ister and replace him on the Patna
throne. First he started his own Party
and, neatly anticipating a Bill intro-
duced by the Minister to abolish the
private ownership of land, announced
his intention to make all his land rent-
free to the tillers. •
Then the Rajah joined the Swatantra
Party and has now swung over to the
Congress itself. But no matter which
set of political principles he adheres
to, at his nod the low-caste Hindus who
form the bulk of his ex-subjects vote
for him and his candidates. And from
what was said in the Sonia reservoir, it
seems they will do so again in February
if they are still fit to vote.
Lately All-India Radio, which broad-
casts the Government sanguine view,
has been telling the nation that showers
of winter rain have measurably eased
the crisis in Bihar. This optimism is
not widely shared in south Bihar, where
in the worst areas there has so far been
no more than a drizzle. The rain,
though welcome, has not reduced the
chief emotion in the air—apprehension.
In the area to which Sonia village
belongs, the Government’s stock of grain
exceeds by only a little a single week’s
penurious supply. The richer farmers
who still have food reserves live in fear
of mob attack. And there’s a real
danger that March may see the final
drying up of all the kutcha wells, those
shallow holes on which most villagers
in south Bihar rely for the irrigation of
their vegetable gardens, and for drink-
ing.


The Soviet in S.-E. Asia
By GERALD SEGAL
THE chances are that the Soviet Union is about to embark upon an effort to
help restore stability in South-East Asia as a whole and to end hostilities
in Vietnam in particular. Any Soviet initiative is, however, predicated upon
being able to carry the international Communist movement in support: otherwise
Soviet motives might be construed as a sell-out to the Americans, a betrayal of
the interest of the South-East Asian revolutionary movements, and as simply a
further stage in the Sino-Soviet quarrel.
The simplest way to an understanding
of the current Soviet position and its
dilemmas is the historical. Immediately
after the Bolshevik revolution in 1917
the victorious Bolshevik (later Com-
munist) Party was confronted with the
problem of its attitude to the colonial
dependencies of the Western capitalist
(or Imperialist) powers, who were also
the enemies of the new Soviet regime.
It was clear that the peoples of the
underdeveloped world sought indepen-
dence of their colonial masters: it was
equally clear that by and large the
movements for independence were not
Socialist or Communist but were in
the hands of bourgeois nationalists.
What then ought to be the attitude
of the Soviet Government both to the
bourgeois national movements for in-
dependence and to the minority Com-
munist groups which were a part of
them? At the second congress of the
Communist International (Comintern)
in 1920, a dispute arose between Lenin
and the Indian Communist M. N. Roy
on precisely this issue. Lenin persuaded
the Comintern that Communists should
support the bourgeois liberation move-
ments but only in cases where those
movements were truly revolutionary:
which as a policy is replete with possi-
bilities for future disagreements. Roy
wanted a harder line. He argued that
the Comintern should not seek to deal
with bourgeois nationalist movements
in the colonial areas but rather only
with the most revolutionary parties and
groups. But, above and beyond that,
Roy held that even though the colonial
revolution in its early stages would not
be a Communist revolution, the leader-
ship of the revolution should be from the
very start in the hands of the Com-
munist vanguard. It was this policy
which, in effect, Mao Tse-tung elabor-
ated in his writings on “new democracy”
in the ’thirties.
the Communist thinking on these
matters at the time presupposed that
the Western Imperialist powers would
fight to maintain their colonies in the
interests of their investments. However,
apart from the Dutch in Indonesia and
the French in Indo-China, this did not,
in fact, happen: instead the Americans
withdrew from the Philippines and the
British withdrew from India, Pakistan,
Burma, and Ceylon. A new problem
arose: how were the Communist Parties
to treat the new nationalist leaders who,
although like Nehru, they may have
been socialists in a Western sense, were
not Communist.
The Comintern had been dissolved
during World War II in the interests of
Allied co-operation: in 1947, however,
t h e Soviets created the Cominform
(Communist Information Bureau),
headed by the hard-line fanatic Andrei
Zhdanov. In February, 1948, at the
Asian Youth Conference in Calcutta,
sponsored by two Communist-front
organisations, the World Federation of
Democratic Youth and the International
Union of Students, the key delegates
received the Moscow message to “expel
their oppressors” and journeyed home
with the Cominform and, therefore,
Moscow instructions on the next stage
of . th . e revolution in their homelands,
Within months a wave of violence
spread over India and South-East Asia:
but the Zhdanovite forward policy failed
an d the Soviets, possibly because they
fe , ( more as \ h a cquired
„ uc lear weapons, began gradually to
res hape their policies,
FinaU ; n 1956 at the 20t h Congress
of , he Soviet Communist Pirty,
Khrushchev inaugurated the policy
which the Chinese scornfully refer to
(although they gave it some support at
the time) as the “Three Peacefuls”
peaceful co-existence (between the
capitalist and socialist blocs); peaceful
transition (from capitalism to socialism;
in other words, the parliamentary road
as opposed to revolution); and, finally,
peaceful competition (that is, economic
development as the test of the virtues
of *. e ' w ° capitalism and
socia ism),
These policy decisions were again
considered at the International Corn-
mu“S' Gonferen . ce m t M Q °, sco " in 195 . 7 >
and at a meeting of 81 Communist
parties Novem g 1961 .
_ . , ' ’ , .
Seemingly under Chinese pressure,
the declaration of the Moscow confer-
(ook a stronger line on the peace .
f u l co . ex i s t e nce question. By implica-
tion it was expected that the Commun-
ist Parties , th « underdeveloped
countries would have to use violence
as the parliamentary conditions which
.
maintain in the advanced industrial
countries of the West do not apply .
The obvious danger that widespread
Communist insurrection in the “third
world,” including South-East Asia,
might lead to Western intervention and,
therefore, a direct confrontation between
the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. did not
deter the Chinese. They boasted, which
the Russians themselves never did, that
the first sputniks and the possession of
ICBMs meant that the Soviets wielded
technical superiority and that, therefore,
the Americans would never dare take
the risk of a nuclear confrontation.
When this situation arose in Cuba in
1962, the Russians wisely backed down.
Since 1957 the Chinese have been
developing the thesis that the policy of
the “Three Peacefuls” is a revisionist
betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, de-
signed to effect a Soviet-American
rapprochement in international affairs,
aimed at China and to lead to the
restoration of capitalism in the Soviet
Union.
In developing their case, the Chinese
could find a great deal to support them
in the writing of Lenin: it could even
be argued that their hard-line interpre-
tation of the 1957 and 1961 documents
was the correct one. The Soviet leader-
ship, since the fall of Khrushchev, has
played a cautious role.
,r pHEY have, in effect, allowed, perhaps
waited for, the Chinese to overreach
themselves while consistently seeking to
show the virtues of, and win support
for, the “Three Peacefuls” line. Thus,
during the 23rd Soviet Communist
Party Congress, the following state-
ment was made about foreign policy
. . . “The U.S.S.R. regards the accom-
plishment of the national economic
tasks set out in the new Five Year Plan
also as fulfilment of its internationalist
duty to the main revolutionary forces
of our age.” Again, according to
Brezhnev, the Soviet Communist Party
leader, referring to the speeches of
foreign delegates, “We saw once again
that the successful building of Com-
munism in the Soviet Unipn constitutes
the main support for their revolutionary
struggle, the main contribution to it.”
The inference is that not armed in-
surrection but peaceful competition
rooted in economic growth is the main
hope for the success of the Communist
cause in the “Third World.”
This view seems to be borne out by
the particular policies of the Soviet
Union in the countries of South-East
Asia, notwithstanding the frequent
public declarations of a hard line in
Vietnam and the military missile sup-
port given the North Vietnamese. For
the past 18 months there has been a
strong undercurrent of 'opinion in the
West that the Soviets are consistently
endeavoring to persuade the North
Vietnamese to negotiate, but have been
stymied initially by the Viet Cong
hopes of an early victory, and secondly
by the Chinese.
More important than the public
attitudes is the claim made by the
Chinese, which the Russians have not
denied, that in February, 1965, when
Soviet Prime Minister Kosygin was en
route to North Vietnam, he sought at
Peking to persuade the Chinese to help
the Americans find a way out of the
Vietnam situation.
So far as Singapore is concerned, the
Soviet, partly motivated by their need
for trade, have not been put off in
developing contacts by the anti-


Communist history of the ruling
People’s Action Party. Prime Minister
Lee Kuan, Yew was described in a
leading Soviet journal as “a progressive
bourgeois leader with the biggest and
most influential Party in Singapore.”
In January of this year Tass, the
Soviet news agency, set up an office
in Singapore, and in August a regular
Russian trade mission was established.
A similar policy extends to Malaysia.
Although they originally supported
Sukarno’s confrontation policy, the
Soviets have since welcomed the Bang-
kok Agreements to end confrontation as
“good news.” And, in October, a trade
mission went to Malaysia to study ways
of establishing permanent direct trade
relations.
The Moscow tirades against the new
Indonesian Government for its policy
against the PKI have abated: indeed,
they were probably insincere all along
because of the close relationship between
the PKI and China. The Russians have
a large investment stake in Indonesia,
and will presumably work toward
amicable relations with the new govern-
ment.
'J'HE visit of the Laotian king, accom-
panied by P.M. Prince Souvanna
Pho'uma, to Moscow suggests that the
Soviet Government will resolve their
ambiguous attitude to the Laotian Gov-
ernment and the Communist Pathet Lao
in favor of the former.
So far as Thailand is concerned, all
the signs are that the recent spate of
insurrectionary activity has been pro-
voked by Chinese-encouraged local
Communist forces. The fact that the
Americans are more and more openly
intervening will further persuade the
Russians to counter the Chinese moves
so as not to face the Americans in a
situation paralleling that in Vietnam.
The Soviets seem also prepared to re-
build their bridges to Cambodia. In
October, 1965, they cancelled a pro*
jected State visit by the Cambodian
leader, Prince Sihanouk, whom they
presumably considered too close to
Chinese. Since then, Sihanouk has be-
come disillusioned: the Chinese, having
encouraged him to break with the
U.S.A. and to reject aid from that
source, have failed to fulfil their own
promise of support, with resulting hard-
ship and Budget deficits for the Cam-
bodians.
What the Soviets now require is inter-
national Communist underpinning of
this policy of peaceful co-existence,
with all its consequences. To get this,
they must persuade the world’s Com-
munist Parties to support them in the
convening of a new World Conference
which will consider the Sino-Soviet split,
and as the Soviets anticipate, come
down on their side as to the interpre-
tation of Marxism-Leninism in the cur-
rent epoch. The Chinese, as the Soviets
see it, have played into their hands by
the extremism of the “Red Guard”
cultural revolution.
State Aid in the U.S.A.
The Roman Catholic school system in the United States stands about halfway
to the goal set at its founding in 1884 to provide a Catholic education for
every American Catholic child. And there it may have to rest.
A brave study of the Catholic
school system prepared by the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame has shown
that if the same percentage of
Catholic children is to be taught in
church schools in 1968 as in 1962,
then ecclesiastical authorities must
spend about $720 million on new
classrooms and must find about
31,000 new teachers, most of them
from religious orders.
Ironically, this sharp recognition
of financial crisis comes just as
Congress has made it possible for
the first time for federal money
to find its way to church-affiliated
schools, even though under rigor-
ously limited conditions. Many
Roman Catholic authorities are eager
for their schools’ share of the bil-
lions of dollars of
federal aid now
available to educa-
tion. Equally
aroused are the
traditional oppon-
ents of govern-
m e n t aid to
church schools;
they feel that even
the present highly
restricted aid may
violate the consti-
tutional strictures
against mixing
Church and State.
There will be no guidance from
the United States Supreme Court
on these sticky issues, at least not
this year. Last month the court re-
fused to review a case involving four
church-related colleges in Maryland.
Meanwhile, the Federal Office of
Education has made it clear that the
new riches now available each year
for helping “educationally deprived”
pupils are not going to go to church
schools in any generous amounts.
Any loans of teachers and equipment
from the tax-supported (or public)
schools must be made for a specified
time and purpose. A film projector
sent to a church school to help pupils
who are backward in reading may
not be used to show films of general
educational interest. And any public
school teachers who cross a parochial
threshold must teach “deprived”
(that is, two years behind the norm
for their age) pupils only.
If secularity is to be the test for
receiving federal funds, the Catholic
primary and secondary schools will
never pass it. Notre Dame’s survey
showed that Catholic students, while
academically above the national
average (largely because of their
schools’ selective policies on admis-
Enrolment in Catholic schools in 1962
sions), felt that moral and religious
training was far and away the major
goal of their education.
One flaw which the report noticed
in the Catholic school system is the
lack of vocational training. There is
still not much to offer those who are
no good at their books, and not
much prospect of it, either; the ex-
pense of equipping workshops may
be too much for a system already
forced, in some cases, to pack 60 chil-
dren into a classroom.
A more serious problem concerns
lay teachers. With growing enrol-
ments the ranks of teachers from
religious orders have to be
supplemented with outsiders’. But
these suffer from low morale. Their
colleagues in public schools are
better paid, while
the parochial
schools do not
offer much oppor-
tunity for promo-
tion: of 42,000 lay
teachers, fewer
than a hundred
are school admini-
strators.
The Notre
Dame report, fin-
anced by a grant
of $350,000 from
the Carnegie Cor-
porat i o n, un-
covered some disturbing facts.
Catholic students, according to
answers given to questionnaires, are
not anti-Negro but do lean toward
anti-Semitism. Moreover, nearly half
of the students tested showed a dis-
appointing grasp of Catholic doc-
trine. In fact, it seemed that devout
children were produced by devout
parents rather than by the atmos-
phere of their school.
If the further studies that the re-
port says are needed into the effects
of Catholic education are made and
bear these facts out, Catholic school
authorities will have to make some
hard decisions. They may have to
choose between smaller classes with
more teaching nuns for the very
young on the one hand, or the
enrichment of the secondary school
curriculum on the other. With
limited funds, Catholic schools can
no longer hope to duplicate the vast
facilities of the public schools for
bringing out the best in the bright-
est and the dimmest at every age.
And it may be that the Catholic
school student’s superior “learning
potential” uncovered by the Notre
Dame investigators will tip the bal-
ance.


ONE MORE
WEEK
Defamation
THE FATHER of film actress Sophia
Loren, Riccardo Scicolone, has accused
her of being “stingy, ungrateful, and
disobedient” and is suing her for
defamation. It will be interesting to
learn Signor Scicolone’s idea of
defamation.
Two Cultures and the ABC
THE LAST we heard of the ABC’s
gadfly Mr. Allan Ashbolt was a week
or so ago when “The Sydney Morning
Herald’s” Data column reported that
Mr. Selwyn Speight and not Mr. Ash-
bolt would stand in for the Director
of Talks, Mr. Alan Carmichael, during
Mr. Carmichael’s holidays. (Mr.
Speight and Mr. Ashbolt alternate as
stand-ins, such is the sensitivity about
seniority in the ABC.) Mr. Ashbolt,
Data understood, had played too active
a part, outside the ABC, during the
Federal election campaign.
Now, by coincidence, Mr. Ashbolt
is to be translated out of Mr. Car-
michael’s department altogether, and
also, by a further coincidence, into a
relatively apolitical sphere. Mr. Ashbolt
will, according to the Acting Controller
of Programs, Mr. Ken Watts, head the
Special Projects Unit. (Mr. Watts is
acting for Mr. Neil Hutchison, who is
on holidays; he is normally Director
of Television Programs.) No date has
yet been set for Mr. Ashbolt to take
over his new duties.
This is not the first time that Mr.
Ashbolt has seemed to be in hot water
but has landed in a bigger pond. “One
Sydney newspaper has three times
claimed that the ABC has sacked Ash-
bolt, and he is still with us,” said an
ABC man.
The Special Projects Unit will be
something of a twin with Dr. Peter
Pockley’s Science Unit, which has
already broken away from the main
body and left the launching pad. The
main difference is that Dr. Pockley
looks after both radio and television,
because the ABC feels it is too confusing
for scientists to be approached by two
people from the one mass-media organi-
sation.
In fact, the name Humanities Unit
was tossed around for a while and is
still being used sotto voce to describe
Mr. Ashbolt’s future domain. But the
ABC faltered at the universities’ re-
action if it began talking about its
humanities team. If anyone can think
of something more imaginative and
original than Special Projects the ABC
will be delighted to hear of it.
In the hierarchy, the two culture
units will, with “Four Comers” and the
embryonic “Tonight,” be responsible
directly to Mr. Watts, and then to
Mr. Hutchison, without any intermedi-
ate boss.
Special Projects may cover some-
thing the same territory as Huw Whel-
don’s Monitor unit does for the BBC.
Its field will be mainly literature, the
arts, and the social sciences. Existing
programs it will take over include
“Spectrum.”
In the main, though, when fields
seem to overlap, the program will
almost certainly go to whoever thought
of the idea first and looks like doing it
best. Mr. Watts talks of “greater flexi-
bility and vitality” and suggests that
“there is something to be said for the
competitive spirit.”
One difficulty may be to find the
right people, both to run the programs
(the “Tonight” team has not been
announced) and to appear on them.
However, Mr. Ashbolt, in his Special
Projects Unit, may be cheered on by
the current “Spectrum” series. A num-
ber of people who have patently little
commitment to any set of ideas, any
religion, or any shade of political
thought have been able to talk at great
length about commitment.
From Modest Beginnings
SYDNEY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
recently acquired its millionth book,
a copy of Henry Lawson’s first work,
published by his mother. It was pre-
sented by the Friends of the Fisher and
it came 111 years after the first book
was nervously purchased by the
optimists planning a University for
Sydney.
They spent less than £100 on works
from the collection of a Dr. Mackaen,
including Scapula Lexicon, Tobler’s
Dictionary of the Alpine Dialects,
Bopp’s Grammatica Sanscriticae, Potts
Etymological Enquiries, Stern/Mohr on
the Philosophy of Grammar, Benary’s
Latin Phonology, several works dis-
coursing on the Anglo Saxons, including
Isidorus Saxon with Glossary (a bar-
gain for 10/6). The classics were repre-
sented with Aristotelis opera omnia,
Platonis opera omnia, and Horatius
Cruquii.
The sub-committee elected to acquire
books for the possible university
library were enjoined not to spend more
than £50 monthly. Now 20 cents in
every University dollar is spent on the
mushrooming library, which costs
$500,000 a year, plus salaries for
approximately 150 people.
Librarian Harry Bryan, who came
from the University of Queensland four
years ago to deal with the exciting de-
velopments of the new building ■ and
the problems of one of the biggest
libraries in the country, estimates that
30 books an hour are added to the
shelves. Twelve thousand students flock
in and out of the undergraduate section
of the library each day. When the,
research section, now being completed,
is in service even more will be able
to be accommodated. There will be
nine floors for books, many of which
are now being stored.
The Friends of the Fisher, who are
officially titled The Friends of the Syd-
ney University Library, were formed in
1961 and their contributions have been
a wonderful source of encouragement
to the library staff. It is partly due to
their work that so many collections, in-
cluding Stewart’s archaelogical books
and Berckelman’s Australiana, have
been obtained, and that so many rare
books are included in the catalogues.
There are more than 30,000 rare
books, many printed before 1600 and
some before 1500, a collection which
Mr. Bryan estimates must be worth
$500,000, though insurance is gener-
ally taken on a nominal basis. He con-
siders the most rare acquisition to be
Newton’s Principia Mathematica, with
the author’s own annotations for the
second edition. But many of the illum-
inated manuscripts are extremely valu-
able.
The books are kept carefully, with
air conditioning set at a suitable point
for their ultimate protection and
humidity kept at a minimum, but they
are not treated as relics. They can be
brought up and viewed by scholars and
students who wish to enjoy them to

the Friends Room, a special area in the
Rare Book section.
Each day in the undergraduate sec-
tion of the University of Sydney
Library, 2500 readers can sit at desks
and have access to 100,000 books on the
open shelves. When the research section,
rising like a giant cube beside the
original library, is finished and stocked,
600 research readers will have direct
access to 2,000,000 books. But this will
take some time to achieve. Mr. Bryan

Tribute to Jack McKinney
J. P. McKINNEY died last week on
Tamborine Mountain, Queensland.
Charles and Barbara Blackman have
written this tribute:
Everyone over 70 has the right to
write their memoirs if their mind stays
keen and the perspectives of the past
interest them. Some do not, and that
is our loss. J. P. McKinney died with
his homework not done. Had he done
it, he would not only have given out
more lastingly his swagful of charac-
ters, comments, and oddities tucked
away over the years, but he might
have made more explicable his
peculiarly potent personality, which
has left him a shadowy, little-known
figure within a large area of influence.
The fact is that for the last third of
his life, when he might have aged
away in invalidism, Jack became young
again.
Many who have visited the moun-
tain in these years poet-hunting (dur-
ing this time he was married to
Judith Wright) found themselves
instead haunted by this spry old man
with the white, clipped beard, keen
blue eyes, who wore his cap indoors,
had something witty and relevant to
say to everyone he met, and a deter-
mined interest in finding out something
new about each person who crossed
his doorstep. The area of philosophy
to which he devoted this period of his
life is more obscure than the man
himself, difficult to accommodate,
impossible to put in a nutshell. Unlike
what one might expect of a bush
philosopher and in common with the
academic minds of his time, he was
concerned with the processes of
thought rather than of conduct. As well
as his involvement in this other half
of philosophy, he was the other half
of that life out of which Judith Wright
has written her poetry and critical
comment.
J. P. (Jack) McKinney was born in
Melbourne, August 12, 1891, educated
at Scotch College, served a journalist’s
“I don’t want to be thought too progressive, but couldn’t we leave
the damned place as it was originally.”
apprenticeship on “Port Phillip
Gazette,” later worked on the Mel-
bourne “Herald,” subsequently free-
lanced for the next 35 years while
working on the land in roles of jacka-
roo, drover, miner, station hand,
shearer, etc. Most memorable from this
period was his creation of the character
The Great Noonan in a series of
humorous sketches in the “Australian
Journal” of the ’thirties (a set of which
was republished in 1956). After a period
of illness in the ’forties which restricted
him to more contemplative reading, he
devoted the remainder of his life to
studying and writing on philosophy.
In book form, he has published one
bad novel, which won much acclaim,
and one good book of philosophy, which
has been largely neglected. “The
Crucible” won first prize for a work of
fiction by a member of the armed forces
after World War I. “The Challenge of
Reason,” published 1950 (Mountains
Press), is available in all universities
and public libraries. Toward the end
of his life, again restricted by illness,
he wrote a few plays. Of these, “The
Well” won a Bathurst Festival Prize,
was published in a book of plays issued
by the Queensland University Press
(editor Eunice Hanger, 1961), and in
a recent play reading at the Sydney
Independent Theatre impressed enough
to be under consideration for produc-
tion.
McKinney’s significance lies in a
special simplicity. He had great in-
telligence about the sources of creativity.
His 20-year partnership with Judith
Wright made their citadel at Tam-
borine an intellectual outpost.
I (Barbara Blackman) first met him
in 1945 when he came to lecture the
then auant garde Barjai Group of
poets and painters in Brisbane. This
was also my first meeting with Judith
Wright. He brought many things into
focus for us. She was at that time
writing her poems of “The Moving
Image.” Her “Woman to Man” col-
lection was written some five years
later at the time of the birth of their
one child, Meredith.
He was in his fifties when he turned
to philosophy and had put five years
into it before he saw clearly a pattern
emerging to his view which he felt was
unintentionally original and to which
he felt bound to devote the rest of his
life. This he did with patience and
tenacity, whittling away at the finest
shade of meaning and implication,
challenging great minds in papers of
brief comment, inconclusive as far as
a declaration of his own philosophical
standpoint, but irritating enough ‘some-
times to be published and often to
elicit long correspondence with editors
or the challenged contributor. Although
his one book received little serious
attention in the academic world, he'was
a figure respected in the Australian
academic world, and was from time to
time sought out for private visit by
those celebrated thinkers prospecting
here from overseas.
I (Charles Blackman) owe much of
the toughening process of my own self-
knowledge and articulation to my talks
'with this man, who had in himself no
great eye for painting, or ear for poetry
in their final form, but that much
more rare and precious thing, a power
of promoting in others the growth of
these crystallisations. Australia has had
few such men few men who, in the
old age of their life, have flowered so
wisely.

The Australian businessman is far-seeing
when he sets out to explore one of the most
lucrative markets in the world to-day
South Africa.
Stable, prosperous South Africa imports
goods and services exceeding $2177 million
per year, including many millions from Aus-
tralian sources. South Africans enjoy a high
standard of living. They buy, and can pay for,
the same high quality goods we make here in
Australia. From buttons to beverages, from
fabrics to foodstuffs, South Africans are
already buying Australian-made goods, but
as yet we export only a fraction of our
potential.
That's why more and more Australians are
taking in South Africa on their overseas
business trips. The additional air fare is very
small indeed. Aboard S.A.A., it’s an over-
night flight to Johannesburg, from where
daily S.A.A. jet flights connect to a network
of European capitals and London.
Inter alia: South Africa is one of the world's top tourist
countries, too. Spare a few days to visit one of her magnificent
game reserves; don’t miss Capetown and Durban; if you've
the time, explore Zululand, the Drakensberg Mountains, the
Kimberley diamond mines. Your travel agent will gladly make
all arrangements.

THE
ANTI-STAR
SYSTEM
By CHARLES HIGHAM
“XT’S like a transit camp.” Gloria
JL Payten, well-known actor’s agent,
of Sydney, and casting director for
most recent Australia-produced feature
films, was talking about her office:
actors by the dozen had come through
it and gone on in the past few years,
mostly to England. The impermanence
of actors’ careers here is well known,
and shows little signs of changing: as we
are continually being reminded, a young
actor coming up in Australia tends to
see his future in London, not in Sydney
or Melbourne. Is this fact merely
symptomatic of the provincial nature
of Australian culture or are there other
causes?
During two months of talking to
actors, theatrical managements, and
directors, I found that there are, in
fact, a number of reasons for the feeling
of hopelessness, of a need to escape,
among up-coming performers. The pic-
ture almost everyone presents of Aus-
tralian theatre is a deeply depressing
one: of seedy conditions and poor pay,
of a depressed area in an affluent
society. In the first place, the lack of
a real capital city in Australia is a
serious cause of our theatre’s miserable
state. New York and London provide a
focus for actors’ ambitions which drives
them to a centre. Neither Sydney nor
Melbourne provides any such focus.
Moreover, as Horne, Pringle, and other
commentators have made clear, there
is no “top” in Australia; here there is
no Broadway or West End, just as
there is no Ritz or Plaza, no great
restaurants nor haute cuisine, no real
society or aristocracy of birth or money.
And theatre depends very much on
being a top function of society, in
itself ruled and constructed like a
hierarchy: an enclosed world of special-
ists with great stars, directors, and pro-
ducers at the top of the pyramid. Aus-
tralia is altogether too democratic and
monochrome, too flattening to the
ambitious to allow for anything as
“fascist,” as ruthlessly stratified, as great
theatre.
There is, too, the Notorious disinterest
of Australians in the achievements of
each other at home, allied to the feeling
that any really outstanding performance,
any show of star temperament, is
slightly suspect, out of place in a
society dedicated to the nice, anonymous
average. An Australian can, of course,
come back as a British or American
star (June Bronhiff, Cyril Ritchard),
but if he remains here he must not
“get above himself.” If Jill Perryman
has been accepted as a star it is largely,
one suggests, because she is so modest,
so much “little me.” The opening night
audience weren’t so much applauding a
star as a local girl “giving it a burl.”
Alistair Duncan, gifted actor appear-
ing in “Luv” at Sydney’s Phillip
Theatre, told me an anecdote that pre-
cisely illustrated this attitude.
“In 1951,” he said, “when I first came
here from England, I was offered a part
in ‘Castle in the Air’ by J. C. William-
son’s. They offered me a ludicrously
small salary. I said, ‘I can’t afford to
do this job. I’m doing well in radio.
This fee is too small.’
“They said, ‘Oh, very well, then we’ll
have to send for someone in England
to play it.’ I said, ‘But you will have
to pay his fare, and then you’ll have
to give him three or four times what
you’re offering me.’ They said, ‘You’ll
have to consider yourself a local actor
now. And’ this is verbatim what
they said afterwards ‘We can’t have
the local actors getting above them-
selves.’ And I’d only been over from
England” he had been with the
BBC Rep. “a few months.”
Duncan also pointed out that the
theatres here exude no air of glamor,
of excitement. “I went into the Theatre
Royal in Sydney one night. It was
as dark, as dismal as possible. There
was a chocolate vendor with a dirty,
stained uniform, unshaven, and wear-
ing dirty shoes. Lady wardresses
brought flowers. There was enough lint
on the curtains to supply St. Vincent’s
Hospital for a month. And when you
go to the theatre, what do you do? You
have a tatty little meal in a tatty little
restaurant in town. No bars in the
theatre. Nowhere to go afterwards. In
New York there are those marvellous
cheap foreign restaurants near Broad-
way. Here nothing.”
The situation was no better in-the
country. Another actor, Walter Sullivan,
who recently went with the Sydney “Q”
Jill Perryman
Theatre on a tour of bush towns, said:
“It’s out of the question for a care-
fully produced and properly lit show
to play in those places because the halls
are totally inadequate. A tiny stage
and six portable lamps just won’t do.”
While theatres look shabby and
down-at-heel, there is no feeling among
actors that they are appearing in some-
thing glamorous, that they must give
of their best. But far worse than this
is the feeling that there is nowhere for
them to aspire to, that there is no
star system for them to enter in the
sense that there is in London or New
York. Behind them lies the depressing
history of a public and managerial
preference for the imported actor
rather than the local one.
Hal Alexander, of Actors’ Equity,
said: “J. C. Williamson’s have a virtual

monopoly so that there is no real com-
petition for an actor’s services the
kind of competition which could force
up his salary and status and give an
agent something to play with in de-
manding more and more for him. The
government-run bodies the Eliza-
bethan and the ABC pay minimum
award rates to players. That’s why so
many actors leave Australia they just
can’t command the highest salaries at
the highest level or achieve the status
they can abroad.
“One actress I recall, who came here
in the lead in ‘Oklahoma!’, wasn’t even
a member of American actors’ equity—
just of chorus equity, yet she was pre-
ferred to a star here. The average
American import in a lead role would
still earn far more than Jill Perryman
is getting in the lead in ‘Funny Girl/
It would be very unusual for a star
to get £lOO a week or more here —a
star at the Phillip would be lucky to
get £4O-£5O a week. In the old
days, I recall, Garnett Carroll would
pay an Australian leading player a
ridiculous £25 a week! Arid they
wouldn’t use him again because he
would probably ask for more the next
time. They’d get someone new from
an acting school instead.”
'ALISTAIR DUNCAN also pointed
out that an actor here can’t speci-
alise. “He has to be a jack of all trades.
He has to work in soap operas on radio
to afford to work in decent plays.”
An agent, who insists on being name-
less, also blamed the lack of money and
status accorded to Australian leading
players on the managements. “When
an actor starts being a star he demands
more money, and managements are
frightened of this. Essentially, it’s a
short-sighted policy. A star can bring
in an audience if he’s sufficiently publi-
cised in advance. I’ve been beating
my head against a brick wall trying to
get better money for my top performers.
But here the payment is the same for
tiro performers as it is for those with
several years’ experience. It’s just this
old business of Australians regarding
everyone as equal, refusing to believe
that anyone is better than* anyone else.
But the theatre is essentially i un-
Australian, anJt'-democratic. Overseas,
the best people fight like hell for the
top roles ... if you know you’re not
going to get much more billing or
money at the top than the bottom
there’s no incentive to improve, to force
your talent as far as it can go. Take
Reg Livermore, for instance. In Eng-
land he’d be a star. Here it’s taken him
six years to get where he is now. Man-
agements here would rather pay some-
one £lO a week less and get someone
second best rather than pay more and
get the highest standards. And the pub-
lic and Press don’t help either.”
I asked Sydney Irving, general man-
ager for N.S.W. of J. C. Williamson's,
for his views. He said that you couldn’t
have a star system here unless audiences
wanted to see Australian stars. And
until very recently since, at any rate,
the .Depression they hadn’t wanted


them. And, anyway, there weren’t any
Australian stars. “I would define a star
as someone the public will come and
see for himself rather than coming to
see the play with the star in it. There’s
no one here who fills that category.”
And what about creating vehicles for
some leading players like, Nancye
Hayes, Jill Perryman Australian
vehicles which could perhaps make
them Australian stars? “I don’t know of
anyone who could write such things.
There just aren’t any good writers of
such things in the country that I know
of.
“And even if there were, you can’t
have out-of-town tryouts here in the
sense that you can overseas. There just
aren’t the theatres outside the cities.
So the business of writing a play for
a star and then testing it on a pro-
vincial audience with the usual
squabbles and rewrites won’t work.
And the market isn’t a sufficiently
large one here to repay the costs of
these experimental tryouts if they
could be done.
“And we’ve only five cities here,
remember. While these might cover
the cost of an imported play bought
for a set amount, they might not cover
the cost of a locally written play or
musical with all the attendant problems
of rewrites and expensive recastings.”
If the local market couldq’t, recoup
the costs of such a starring. vehicle,
how about overseas? “Our experience
there has been far from salutary. Take
“The Sentimental Bloke’ for instance.
It flopped in New Zealand—they just
didn’t understand it at all across the
Tasman. And you would have the
.same problem of idiom anywhere else.”
How about vehicles written for
television stars? Could they recoup
enough on this market? “Not to go
by our experience. Digby Wolfe went
into ‘Under the Yum Yum Tree’ and
failed to attract audiences. Hazel
Phillips and Ted Hamilton went into
an already famous vehicle, ‘The Boys
From Syracuse,’ and didn’t succeed.
No, I’m afraid TV stars cut no ice
on the stage. And still less would they
cut ice in an unknown vehicle such as
an Australian might write.”
Eric Duckworth, of the Phillip
Theatre in Sydney, disagreed. An
Englishman, he and William Orr, also
English, have for years represented the
only really cheerful glimmer of light
in our theatrical darkness by an
enlightened English policy of building
names through a continuity of produc-
tion, making stars known for certain
things. Gordon Chater, Lyle O’Hara,
Diana and Jill Perryman, among
others, were established under this non-
Australian management years ago in
the brilliant Phillip St. revues.
“We’ve got John McKellar who
did our very successful ‘A Cup of
Tea, A Bex, and A Good Lie Down’
writing a musical specially for Gloria
Dawn,” Mr. Duckworth said. “For 12
years the bulk of our revue material
has been written by Australians. We
like to foster stars here. There is a
great deal of latent talent in Australia,
but managements are afraid to develop
it they must learn to do so, if
necessary from the rawest of raw
material. Selling stars is like selling
toothpaste. You have to shout their
names from the rooftops. Manage-
ments play safe here. And it’s all so
snobbish here. Their outlook on life is
that it’s better to bring a star from
Broadway or the West End. Unless
we change this, we are never going to
have an Australian theatre.”
Was it possible, I asked Mr. Duck-
worth, for us to have a national
theatre, a kind of Australian Old Vic,
with its own system of stars? “I’d like
to see that, of course. I’d like to see
Australian written plays and players
create a national image in the theatre.”
Everything seemed to point to the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust establishing
such a theatre, taking the cream of
the actors, establishing a national reper-
tory company in one city. I asked
Stefan Haag, of the Trust, why, after
Stefan Haag
so many years, the Trust had failed to
establish anything of the kind. “The
purpose of the Trust is to spread the
theatre as wide as possible in a demo-
cratic community,” he said. “To have
a permanent repertory company of the
kind you mention would be the cream
on the theatrical coffee here. But we
have a limited subsidy. We have to
decide between having the coffee that
is to say, theatre spread as wide as
possible throughout the community
or the cream, that is to say, a repertory
company, a national theatre, and its
stars. We decided to take the coffee.”
Couldn’t, we have both? What about
the Trust Players, so wisely started by
Hugh Hunt back in the ’fifties, so
abruptly abandoned? “The Players
were abandoned because first of all if
you played them in the commercial
theatres the costs were too high. You
tended to be in business for the airlines,
flying the actors about the way you
did. You had to pay the actors lots of
money because they were away from
home, and many actors don’t like being
away for long periods. Moreover, if
you have your company of players
centred in one city, say Sydney, there
would be indignation in Melbourne. Or
vice versa. You must remember that all
the taxpayers are paying for us. All
must have a share.”
Then what about having a national
theatre in both Sydney and Melbourne?
“I must admit we are beginning to
think about that. When the Opera
House and the Cultural Centre in Mel-
bourne are finished it may be possible.”
And if there were such theatres, what
about developing a star system within
them? “You' must remember that no
managements like stars. They all fight
the star system. You become a victim,
once you create a star, of that in-
dividual’s whim. Besides,
don’t create stars anyway. Audiences
do. And Australians doq’t tend to
create stars. They compare their stars
with the greatest from overseas, and
their stars cannot stand up under the
comparison. So actors here tend to go
to London, to come back as stars here.
No Darlene Johnson, Nancye Hayes,
-and Jill Perryman are not stars.”
In the course of the long talk with
Stefan Haag two things emerged loud
and clear: he’s far from enthused at
the idea of creating a national theatre,
and he’s not keen on creating an Aus-
tralian star system within that
if the Sydney-Melbourne scheme does
come off. Useless then, one imagines, to
look for a future for actors in the-
setting up of the Trust; a tragedy if one
considers that the Trust is the oner
organisation that could, theoretically,
provide a flow of work for performers;
up to the star level. And why, I asked.
Mr. Haag, hadn’t the Trust established
a national drama a flow of plays-
for repertory showing the real Australia
either? “Australians don’t want to see
themselves in an unfavorable light on
the stage. Their most secret desire is
what is the word in English flattery
Since there was clearly no hope from
this quarter, could the commercial
managements establish a repertory, a.,
system of stars? Fred Hebert, gifted.
American director of “Funny Girl,”
“Hello Dolly,” and “Cactus Flower,”*
thought not (for commercial reasons),,
and felt that this was something the-
Trust should do. And he felt that no-
matter what was done to foster Aus-
tralian stars, these performers would
still want to go abroad for “the top.”'
“After ‘Funny Girl,’ Jill Perryman,
probably won’t find another role that
suits her for years. Anyone who ‘makes
it’ in Australia would just have to go-
to London or New York because that’s,
where they can be seen by agents and
talent scouts. That’s where the action
is. And chances for movies. Here, who-
can see them?
“And vehicles for them? In the States,
a man like Johnny Burke can earn
100,000 dollars a year from his song
royalties while he’s spending two years
writing a new musical. Who here coulcL
spend two years writing a musical?
Unless he starves.”

frld in “Funny Girl,” in Melbourne,
presented the gloomiest picture of all.
There wasn’t, he felt, a real demand
for drama or stars in Australia at all.
He cited his recent tours, in which
men had come up to him and said,
“Ah, well, I won’t be able to get along
to the show tonight, there’s a meeting
of the RSL. The wife and daughter’ll
go-”
“There’s a feeling that theatre is
woman’s work. And actors have no
status. I’ll say to someone, ‘l’m an
actor,’ and they’ll say, ‘Oh, are you,
and what do you do for a living?’ ”
And there was a feeling that actors
were effeminate: Sullivan had to
explain frequently on tour that the
men in his company were ex-servicemen.
The theatre, here, Sullivan felt, had
never really become professional, and
was still thought of as an amateur
activity. “The ‘give it a go’ philosophy,
and ‘near enough is good enough’
don’t work in the theatre. You meet
these theatre people from overseas
men like Fred Hebert and they Ye
so quietly assured, so much a part of
something that matters. Not so here.”
about a national theatre? “If
it were run by the Elizabethan
Theatre it would be a disaster —on pre-
vious performance. The organisation just
isn’t competent. It needs to be run by
professionals, not people Dr. Coombs
happens to consider suitable. Sydney is
the logical centre. You get a company
together from the best actors. And
you pay them well for appearing in
such a playhouse.” Would an actor’s
co-operative, federally sponsored, with
an Olivier-like policy of star-building,
be the answer then? “Yes. But you
must be given autonomy by the govern-
ment sponsorship. No petty bureau-
cratic interference.”
Finally, I went to see Jill Perryman,
the one figure created by the stage
here for what despite Stefan Haag
I would call authentic stardom (and
then by an American Fred Hebert, not
by an Australian). It wasn’t really
surprising to find Miss Perryman in
an extremely modest flat, whose rental
must be less than equivalent of . a one-
day hotel stay for Ethel Merman, Judy
Garland, or other stars I’ve interviewed
in Sydney. She seemed cheerfully
philosophical about the fact that, so far
from being in the mink-and-limousine
category, she lives a quiet domesticated
life with her husband, dancer Kevan
Johnson, and her young children.
She agreed that, until recently, Aus-
tralians hadn’t accepted other Austra-
lians as stars. “They prefer somebody
from New York somebody the pro-
gram could say had played with Jack
Benny or Lucille Ball. Television, of
course, and the teenagers have now
created stars Gordon Chater’s a
star. But I agree that even now the
stage hasn’t. Although this vehicle for
Gloria Dawn may make her an authen-
tic Australian star.”
But stars even Jill Perryman
weren’t legends in the British or
American sense, were they? “Well, you
don’t have the promoters here. Admit-
tedly I was stopped in the street before
‘Funny Girl’ opened and the fact
that the opening night was televised
helped me a great deal. But you’ve
got to keep plugging away at promo-
tion. For me the publicity fizzled out
after a while. I do think photographers
could have been sent to my home, to
show me cooking or shopping.
“I don’t go in for the glamor bit
admittedly furs and limousines
although that would be nice, wouldn’t
it? But in a way there’s just as good
a story in the fact that away from
the stage, away from playing Fannie
Brice, the great Broadway star, I’m
just a normal, everyday mum. They
just won’t give you the big build-up
here unless they’re on to something
big like ‘My Fair Lady,’ for in-
stance. But you’ve got to give the big
build-up to everything.
“They’ve paid American actors here
500 dollars a week.” And Australians,
I interrupted her, a half of that for the
same part? “A third! They’ll say, ‘But
this part is such a marvellous experience
for you.’ And we’re so used to being
brow-beaten here, to taking second-
best, that we’ve accepted that kind of
thing. But I hope we’re getting beyond
that now.”
We’ll only be beyond it, I wanted
to add, when Jill Perryman and others
like her receive precisely the same
amount that an American or British
star can get in the same role. It will
be disgraceful and one begins to
suspect that this is what is about to
happen if managements here decide
that it’s cheaper to cast Australians as
leads in future, and disguise this de-
cision behind the announcement that
they’ve agreed finally to give Australians
a break.
JHOR the future, the guidelines seem
clearly enough laid down. Either
under the Elizabethan Trust or prefer-
ably a federal grant administered by an
independent body of actors and experi-
enced professional producers, a national
theatre must get away, rigidly exclusive,
hierarchical, non-democratic, devoted to
the highest standards, combining the
great classics of the world with new Aus-
tralian, British, and American plays, and
centred in one city, touring for part of
the year. Agents here must do more
than collect 10 percent, we must, too,
have a new attitude on part of the
commercial managements, a policy
along the lines set up by the Phillip, in
which players will be built up in
promotions and sold like toothpaste, to
adapt Eric Duckworth’s memorable
phrase. Commissions, too, of new works
from Australian playwrights, preferably
built around specific leading players.
And finally, please, a new vehicle for
Jill Perryman, commissioned by J. C.
Williamson’s, to follow her gre'at tri-
umph in “Funny Girl.”

AROUND MELBOURNE
Lost a Dragon, Gained a Tower
THE trouble with the St. James
building, at the corner of Bourke
and William Streets, was this
it was no architectural gem. It couldn’t
raise even a “D” grading from the
National Trust, and nobody wrote tear-
ful letters about it to the “Age.”
It was built in 1889 at the height of
the Land Boom, when we were all
stinking rich. This was our prestige
office building. Admittedly, it didn’t
get fancy things like sewerage until the
turn of the century, but it housed some
of the richest men in the country. There
was A. T. Creswick, R. G. Casey, father
of Lord Casey, Sir William Clarke,
grandfather of Sir Rupert Clarke, John
Sanderson, the shipping man, and
Herbert Power, the chairman of the
VATC. Those were the grand old days
when a gentleman could take two to
four hours for lunch and dine over the
road at the Australian Club.
In more recent years the St. James
building has been everything. One time
it housed some very doubtful ladies. It
was a home for solicitors, for artists, for
importers, and there was an elderly
lady who lived in a flat with half a
dozen cats. There were fascinating
alleys, a catwalk across the roof, and
ah old hydraulic hoist which once was
used for raising and lowering the
sanitary cans.
But, best of all, the St. James build-
ing had vast subterranean cellars and
housed six wholesale liquor firms. And
it was marvellous fun on a quiet after-
noon to make one’s way around the
firms. It was like going to the Royal
Show and making out that you wanted
to buy a reaper and binder. There
were drinks to be had everywhere.
J KNOW you are blushing at this
shameless mention of free liquor, but
the St. James building was the site of
the wooden Church of St. James, where
my namesake, Mr. John Batman, is said
to have worshipped soon after the colony
was founded; then of the stone church
built in 1842, and now shifted to West
Melbourne. But the point I am coming
to is that in 1963 the Church of England
sold the two acres of the St. James site
to the AMP Society for $3 million, the
biggest land deal in Melbourne’s history.
Alas, Whelan the Wrecker moved in
last February. The nice wholesale liquor
stores scattered to Hawthorn and else-
where, and so the old place began to
come down. Did I say the place was
not an architectural gem? Well, there
was one thing, a great arch, lofty
enough to take the biggest of Leviathan
coaches; undoubtedly the most beautiful
thing of its kind in Australia.
Whelan wrecked the great building
bit by bit. Yet these Whelans are
strange people, they get a curious love
for the things they destroy, and they
left the arch until * last. So there it
was, alone on this newly created square
of two acres, and it looked marvellous,
just like the Arc de Triomphe, and
just as large. The decision to pull it
down came on- a Sunday morning
and it was terrible; I couldn’t even get
anyone to take the picture. Whelan’s
men chipped away at the base with
jackhammers, then wheeled up a bull-
dozer. They attached cables from the
dozer to the top of the arch then
pulled. First it trembled, then slowly
it began to move, more and more, then
in one splendid piece it heeled right
over and hit the ground with a mar-
vellous resonant thump that must have
been heard in the Dandenongs. Under-
neath were the old empty wine cellars
and it was like the thump of the
world’s biggest drum. Only half a
dozen of us saw the end.
Oh, there was one other thing. As
the building came down an attic wall
was exposed, and it revealed a mag-
nificent 20ft.-long dragon. Unques-
tionably this was an old opium den.
But it wasn’t. It turned out that it was
the old studio occupied by Arthur
Boyd, Alan McCulloch, now Mel-
bourne “Herald” art critic, and other
artists back in the early ’thirties. When-
ever they weren’t making any money
they just added more dragon. And
that’s another thing on the AMP and
Whelan’s head, that mural could have
gone to Rudy Komon for thousands.
Now the St. James site is a great
hole in the ground and the AMP
Society has announced plans for a
372 ft. office block which will cost
$l9 million. The Society has produced
careful charts which prove that it will
be our highest building, 46ft. higher
than the CRA building. What’s more,
“Typically Australian, eh, buddy?”
it will have a slight edge in size
(833,000 sq. ft. compared with the next
biggest, the Princes Gate with 740,000).
Are you feeling a little alarmed in
Sydney? Please do not. Head office of
the Australian Mutual Provident
Society is in Sydney, so the local folk
have been tactful. The Melbourne
AMP building will be 12ft. lower than
the AMP building at Circular Quay.
It pays to keep the junior colony in
its place.
Tenders for this building did not close
until 2 p.m. on the final day. Mr.
F. O. Watts, managing director of E. A.
Watts, waited until 1 p.m. Then the
stapling machine broke down and they
couldn’t punch all the papers together.
Finally they were left with only 20
minutes to get the tender to -AMP.
They left with two cars, the second
in case the first broke down. You can
imagine the concern. Mr. Watts said it
took nine months to prepare, it con-
tained 800 pages and cost the firm
$lO,OOO.
best feature of the plan is that
buildings will occupy only 60 per-
cent of the two acres the rest will be
open plaza, with the promise of a decent
sculpture. (Although National Mutual
and Conzinc Riotinto also promised us
fine sculptures and we haven’t seen
them yet.) Otherwise it is a somewhat
curious design. There is a tall, 27-storey,
utterly unadorned pile, to be known
as St. James Tower. Then down be-
low there will be an L-shaped, seven-
storey building with tiered balconies,
which could easily be the new grand-
stand for the MCG.
It has attracted very little enthusi-
asm among local architects and there
is a very good reason for this. AMP
went to the San Francisco firm of Skid-
more, Owings and Merrill, which did
the Shell building in Melbourne, the
Qantas hotel in Sydney, and soipe
buildings in Canberra. As one well-
known architect said: “Look they
did with Qantas in Sydney and now
this.” Skidmore, Owings and Merrill
have a world-wide reputation with
office buildings and' AMP felt their
experience would be useful for. Mel-
bourne. They are working with Bates,
Smart and McCutcheon, of Melbourne,
who are doing the drawings and plans
and supervising the construction. But
the local argument is that nobody
knows local conditions like a local man.
However, AMP have the whole area
pretty well fixed. They don’t want the
new St. James building to be over-
shadowed. They have even bought the
old Menzies Hotel on the other corner
so that one day they can build a nice
matching building. In the meantime it
will be a fine place to go over for
two-hour lunches.

Something From Santa
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
ENGLAND was easy: koalas for
the ladies and boomerangs for
the men from a souvenir gift shop
at Circular Quay. It took one hour to
buy them, three hours to pack them
up, and a quick sprint down to the
docks to catch the Canberra.
Australia, however, is proving diffi-
cult. Unless some miracle happens, what
our friends are liable to get for
Christmas this year are either paisley
pencils in a paisley container or Robert
Carrier’s cooking recipes, which are
handy to take shopping and washable
when you get home; the attractive
thing about both these items being their
price of $1.25. ,
Down at Kaotica, which one found
hard not to call Erotica, a tall, thin girl
called Ping appeared uncertain whether
she was selling Brilliant New Things
or Brilliant Old Things. Whatever her
Things, they are destined for the kit-
chen. She emerged from under a table
and cried if only we had been there
last week we would have loved it, as
it was she was waiting for a new ship-
load of Things from London, in which
were some marvellous scales selling for
a helluva lot, about $lOO, she thought.
Meanwhile, what did we think of
Mary Quant’s PVC aprons selling at
$8? A trifle steep, actually. “Ah, but
they’re special, they’re English! You
don’t have to iron or wash them, just
wipe ’em down.” She lit a cigarette and
advised us to wait till the weekend; it
would be a riot.
They were going to put a table on
the pavement and pile up Things for
Sale and it would stay as long as the
police let it. Then they were going to
have Kitchen Teas and everyone could
come and buy on the spot, then they
were going to have Lists, like they do
in London, then —a flurry in the door,
and partner Joy arrived with the news
that she had cleared the Things at the
dock and Ping went off to try on a new
white trouser-suit. Joy thought people
were buying for Christmas now; yes, of
course, the towels were doing well, a
14-year-old boy bought a honey cup-
board for his mum for $B, and that
dresser came in at 8.30 a.m. and was
sold at nine for $7O, and please don’t
take any notice of those stuffed birds,
it would ruin their image, they belonged
to interior decorator Neville Marsh.
We noted copper egg-cups and cut-
out chopping boards among the Brilli-
ant New Things, a chamber-pot among
the Brilliant Old Things, and bought a
packet of tea, a pot of marmalade, and
a book on Where to Have Tea in
London.
Neville Marsh had not been seen
since a party two nights before, but
schoolgirls from nearby Ascham were
whizzing in and out of his shop for
yards of furnishing material to make
into shifts. One large lady came in, and
Mr. Marsh’s partner, Raymond Siede,
said if it took six and a half yards to
cover a chair, he thought four yards
would cover her. He is sick of Christ-
massy windows and, given half the
chance to finish it, he is putting in his
brass bed covered in goatskin, under
which a lady model (fake) will lie with
Christmas balls stuck all over her, and
over all Tiffany lampshades will hang
in profusion.
What about a hammock for a
present? $12.60. Or $44 goatskin rugs
Christmas shop window for Sydney decorator Neville Marsh
from the highlands in Greece? Or
broken lumps of glass at $10? No, the
Goddess of Flight (1920) was not for
sale. He had painted her face himself,

arranged a bowl of feather flowers and
they will appear on the cover of a
womens magazine shortly.
Tom Gillies was selling decapitated
owls with holes in their half-heads.
The shop assistant didn’t know what
they were for, flowers, perhaps but
surely not? No, called a youth from
the doorway; they’re for pencils. The
lady thought certainly not. Incense, she
said, that’s what they’re for. Anyway,
at $2.50 we declined.
We took a turn up the road and noted
the general lack of Christmas decora-
tion. The butcher wished his customers
a Merry Yuletide, adding Order Your
Joint Quick. The hairdresser conveyed
similar thoughts, substituting Perm for
Joint, and further along an antique
collector with a nice line in Georgian
table-tops with 1966 legs said he’d paid
a dollar for a man to paint his squiggly
message of goodwill, which covered 12
windows and it took ’im ’alf an hour.
We later learnt bunting had gone up at
Bondi.
What could we buy for our four-
footed friends at the Dandy Dog
Beauty Shop? Doggie Spectacles, soft
and pliable, bends to any shape (for
larger dogs adjust with rubber band),
in a red Mt case $3 m and ear

get them in unless they did,” replied
the ghl tersely. We purchased a rubber
bone and swung int0 F a gift sh where
the merchandise looked a little weary
an( j swun g out again at high speed.
On second thoughts, and considering
the way things are going, it will be
down to the Quayside for koalas
and boomerangs for Australia, too.


Wine Books to Buy
By CELLARMASTER
ALL of a sud-
den, a rash,
a rush, a
plethora of wine
books. My own
humble offering,
Max Lake’s
“Classic Wines of
Australia,” Andre
Simon’s “The
Wines, Vineyards,
and Vignerons of
Australia,” and
Dan Murphy’s “The Australian Wine
Guide” have all appeared in the past
week or so. Even the omnipresent Mr.
Graham Kerr has included a reference
by me of Australian wines in his new
cook book. These, of course, will pro-
vide much meat (with appropriate
wines, of course) for the growing circle
of wine writers. Lucky them.
It is difficult for a wine professional
to review other wine professionals’
books. To start with, I could disagree
with opinions and statements in all.
I disagree violently with Dan Murphy’s
remarks about Wine Judging and I
would like to meet him across a dinner
table at six paces with loaded muscats.
I cannot agree with the obvious lack
of regard that Max Lake has for our
Tawny Ports, and I cherish the thought
of all the bottles that we are going to
consume together while arguing about
this. But to a great extent these are the
personal declamations of the cheerful
egotists of the wine industry (amongst
them I hasten to include myself) and
should not cloud the event.
The Wines, Vineyards, and Vignerons
Of Australia, by Andre Simon. Lans-
downe Press. $9.
Though there is much to praise about
M. Simon’s latest book, it must be to
all dedicated Australian wine lovers a
great disappointment.
I repeat that there is much to praise.
It is wonderful to see such a world-
eminent authority as M. Simon writing
a book on Australian wines. The pub-
lishers have done a splendid job, the
book is well laid out and designed, and
the maps are the best I have seen yet.
The photographs by Val Sowada are
generally very good and often superb.
The major section of the book is
divided into three parts the vine-
yards, the wines, and the vignerons.
The first and third parts are pleasant
discursive resumes of the history of the
establishment of the vineyards and their
growth until today, and of the men
behind them. There is much useful in-
formation here. The first three parts
appear to be M. Simon’s work and
occupy some 126 pages. Nearly another
70 pages are given to various appendices
as follows:
1. An amusing, informative, and aptly
chosen anthology of early wine writ-
ings.
2. An excellent examination of Aus-
tralian wine grape varieties com-
piled by Graham Gregory, the
N.S.W. Government Viticulturist.
3. The Show Specifications laid down
by the Royal Agricultural Society
of South Australia’s Wine Commit-
tee in 1965 which warrant the wide
circulation the book will un-
doubtedly find.
4. A list compiled by Mr. Victor Gib-
son of his own particular wine
favorites. It is his list and one can-
not argue with this.
Further appendices are devoted to
wine in the kitchen and the care and
service of wine, the work of the Aus-
tralian Wine Research Institute is re-
viewed, and there is the inescapable
glossary (containing many wine, words
not used in Australia).
“What, then,” you ask, “is the dis-
appointment? So far you have re-
viewed all but ten pages of the book
and are highly enthusiastic about it.”
The answer is simple. Like many
wine and food men I revere the per-
sonality, knowledge, and charm of M.
Andre Simon, and this doubles the dis-
appointment, for I feel that he has let
us down. In Part 2 —the Wines of Aus-
tralia we expected to get a pointed
constructive dissertation on our wines.
Instead we got some 15 pages (ten
actual pages) of irrelevance in which
the author seems mainly preoccupied
with alcoholic strengths.
I spent some time in M. Simon’s
company during his tour of Australia
in 1964-65 at both large and small
parties. He is a wonderful man and you
could not meet a more charming and
considerate person. He avoided talking
about the wines then, and he has now.
Perhaps he didn’t like our wines.
Perhaps he felt he would embarrass
or displease the vintners he met
throughout Australia. If so, he has
done them and us an injustice, for a
book of this title and substance, bear-
ing his name, should have been quite
ruthless and objective in its approach.
That it is not is a major disappoint-
ment.
The Classic Wines of Australia, by Max
Lake. Jacaranda Press. $4.75.
One could not be disappointed with
this book. It is just too ebullient, too
assertive, too dogmatic, too pointed
altogether to disappoint. It will cause
endless arguments and I look forward
to being amongst them. The sheer
effrontery of the man to sit down to
write about such wines. Not that he
lacks authority. Lake is undoubtedly
one of the great enthusiasts of wine in
Australia, a man who has carried his
enthusiasm to a degree not matched
by anyone else I know here.
Furthermore, as he points out, he is
in no one’s pocket, owes nothing to
anybody (except perhaps the Vineyard
Development Bank), and has no one-
cellar palate. I would go so far as to
say that he has as much comprehension
of the different styles of wine in Aus-
tralia as anyone I know. And he has
the guts to put it all down on paper!
He defines classic as being of the
highest quality of a particular style
that has been established for longer
than ten years and has been consistent
during that period. Lake then proceeds
to embark upon five chapters of
the advanced beginners’ guide. He
becomes as basic as “Oak casks (a
cask has curved staves) and vats (with
flat sides)” . . . and then throws
around such words as saccharomyces,
amygdalin, benzaldehyde and Kinaes-
thetic. These words to all but an
accomplished scientist or chemist mean
little. However, in these five chap-
ters there is a great deal of stimulating,
tightly packed, and tersely expressed
information containing much original
thinking.
ir pHE real guts of “The Classic Wines
of Australia” is contained in Part 2
The Wines. Where M. Simon failed
us, Dr. Lake does us proud. A close
examination of the various areas and
the great wines they produce. A lengthy
analysis of each wine and an attempt
to stay away from the great “oncers”
those wines which were somehow
fluked in one particular year and be-
came famous throughout the Common-
wealth.
He has two different kinds of maps.
Those of the Barossa Valley, North
Victoria, and Adelaide and Southern
Vales areas are nothing more than
adequate representations of where the
wineries are. But the other maps, and
particularly those of the Hunter Valley
and Coonawarra areas, specify vine-
yards, showing the size and shape and
location of them.
Though not essentially highly accur-
ate, they do convey the feel and char-
acter of those areas and the proximity
and relation of different wines to each
other more than any other maps I
have seen.
It needs to be read several times, and
on going back the reader will find
more in it. One of the most fre-
quent queries I receive sounds some-
thing like, “I’m interested in wine and
want to learn more about it. Please
tell me what the best wines are and
how I can start a cellar. What wines
I should serve, what wines will I keep?
How should I keep them?” and so on.
And for a 4c stamp Lake answers
all these and far more.
Lake claims this is not a beginner’s
book, yet I would recommend the book
to all but the only casually interested.
Many will disagree with a lot of the
statements he makes. Lake realises
this and in fact points out, “After all,
it’s my book.” I believe that Lake, in

A Brambles prime mover in Melbourne edges a piggy-back trailer onto
a New South Wales Government Railways flat wagon for the trip to
Sydney.
TRANSPORT: TOFC (trailer on flat car) is the official name
given to railway "piggy-back” of road vehicles.
Introduced by the New South Wales Government Railways,
this form of door-to-door service revolves around the use of
railway owned road trailers, and flat rail wagons especially
designed to carry the greatest volume of cargo within the
limits set by height of railway tunnels and width of rail gauge.

INTERNATIONAL DIVISION: Sydney and
Adelaide contribute to Brambles News with picture
stories of customs and shipping activities into and
out of Australia.
Brambles Customs and Shipping Branch in Sydney
has recently been associated with the Japan Trade
Centre in the staging of three major trade exhibi-
tions. The first was the International Engineering
Exhibition, at the Sydney Showground, at which a
wide range of Japanese machinery and appliances
was on display. The exhibition material was im-
ported on two ships in 125 cases, weighing a total
of 206 tons. Brambles carried the displays from the
wharf to the Showground and then unpacked them.
Brambles was again appointed to act in a similar
capacity for the Electrical and Home Appliance Ex-
hibition held at the Japan Trdde Centre, followed
by the Central Japan Products Show.
The picture shows a section of the Japanese pavi-
lion at the International Engineering Exhibition in
Sydney.
Brambles Customs and Shipping Branch in Adel-
aide is the official baggage agent for the South
Australian Government and inlthis capacity handles
the baggage and personal effects of the thousands
of migrants who arrive in Adelaide. There is
also a considerable flow of tourists departing for
overseas ports and Brambles has developed for
them a Self Pak”, which allows tourists to pack
their own luggage in cartons or cases supplied by
Brambles, have them collected and shipped over-
seas without worry. The photograph shows “Self

area for the construction of new coke ovens. In the background a Caterpillar D 7 bulldozer
with a ripper attachment stockpiles the slag for the Traxcavator, which loads tippers for
cartage to the dumping area. The bulldozer has won the slag from an excavation for the
foundations of the coke ovens. The slag is extremely abrasive and requires powerful
machinery to excavate it from the reclaimed area where the slag has been tipped over
many years since the first blast furnace was built in Whyalla.


Brambles News
(ADVT.)
INDUSTRIAL SERVICES (CRANES): to round out
this series of glimpses of Brambles in Action —1966,
three jobs for mobile cranes.
Whilst Sydney slept, cranes from Sydney Regional
Branch, working for Whelan the Wrecker lifted down
ten girders supporting the old tramway bridge which
spanned the Northern approach to Sydney Harbour
Bridge.
Working from midnight to dawn for five consecutive
nights, the cranes lifted the girders onto Brambles
heavy low-loaders for removal to storage.
The demolition of the bridge marked another stage in
the programme to build the Warringah Expressway.
This was an operation requiring care and precise
timing so that traffic flow would not be interrupted
over one of the most heavily used road sections in
Australia.

Cranes are working together again in this photograph
taken in Brisbane it is not a snowstorm in the pic-
ture —but gypsum falling to the stockpile. The scene
here is Newstead wharf, Brisbane, and four Brambles
cranes are unloading a cargo of 3,000 tons of gypsum
from the S.S. WATAMURRA. Rigged with 50 foot jibs
and handling clamps, the cranes took just three days
to unload the cargo. Another example of diversity in
Brambles operations.
Three Brambles cranes at work on the coal loader pro-
ject at Carrington, near Newcastle. The coal loader
will be used to load ships at the rate of 1,000 tons
an hour. The Brambles cranes, rigged with 100 foot
jibs hoisted three’ 100 foot long sections of conveyor
belt support gantry into position in one day. The three
sections brought the number of Units lifted to six,
completing the gantry which will carry coal from the
storage bin to the surge bin near the dockside. A
further 1,500 feet of conveyor belt will carry the coal
to the ships. The purpose of the surge bin is to pro-
vide a steady flow of 1,000 tons of coal an hour, to
ships being loaded —without a surge bin the supply
would be erratic as railway trucks which empty into
the storage bin could not deliver enough coal per hour
to meet requirements.

writing his book, has done a great ser-
vice to the Australian wine industry.
The Bachelor’s Guide To Cooking In
Wine. Edited by Gil and Mercia
O’Neill. J. B. Studio Productions.
$1.05.
This book contains 306 recipes and
20-odd drink mixes. It is unpretentious,
clearly and simply laid out, and con-
tains a great deal of useful ideas and
food thoughts. As the title implies, it
is preoccupied with using alcoholic
beverages (cider, beer, liqueurs as well
as wine) in most cases intelligently and
even ingeniously. One small complaint
of mine is that while I love using wine
in cooking, it can be overdone. It
should always, augment the flavors of
the food being featured and should
never dominate. For example, recipe
No. 203 (Champignons Flambees) uses
i pint of Sherry with £lb. Mushrooms
and specifies sfinmering until the sherry
has almost evaporated. I tried this
recipe pointedly to see if the sherry
flavor would dominate and it does,
completely obscuring the magnificent
flavor inherent in all good mushrooms.
But this is an excellent little book
and would make an ideal Christmas
stocking item, though I cannot really
understand why bachelors should be
guided. They should do the obvious
thing and marry a good cook, as I did.
The Australian Wine Guide, by D. F.
Murphy. Sun, Books. $1.35.
This paperback is a book for begin-
ners and the burgeoning enthusiast. And
again, though I find many points to
argue about, I think it is packed with
information and would strongly recom-
mend it to anyone who is starting to
enter into th£" endless fascination that
lies in wine. In the introduction Mr.
Murphy says, “I should hate to think
that anyone who reads this book should
believe that I am endeavoring to set
myself up as a final authority. Admit-
tedly, I use the first person and quote
my own opinions extensively. My reason
for this is that I don’t wish my thoughts
and ideas to be expressed as though
they were truths agreed upon by all.”
Hmph. What a hope! But this is the
point I make about these wine books.
They must be a collation of the opinions
of the person who writes them and
they stand or fall on the knowledge and
ability of that person.
The Australian Wine Guide is a beaut
little book. The subject matter covered
is * exhaustive and extremely compre-
hensive. Dan Murphy defines wine
wine grapes, the wine scene in Australia.
There is an excellent split-up of the
various wine companies into different
categories, and a large list of the
smaller winemakers. (Which completely
refutes M. Simon’s statement that in-
evitably the small winemaker will be
swallowed up.) Chapters are devoted
to sherry, white table wines, red table
wines, sparkling wines, and dessert
wines. The author names wines fre-
quently, an attitude which I applaud
since there is no point in generalising
to the potential consumer.
He inspects the various vineyard
areas fairly thoroughly in a chatty and
slightly lecturing style, and shows how
many excellent blends there are,
naming them, and making us aware that
among them hre the great prizewinners
of Australia.
After good chapters on the history
of Australian winemaking, and the
correct use of wine, he discourses at
length on wine merchants. Being one
himself, he must favor them, but other
than the South Australian Hotel he
completely ignores the great cellars of
Menzies and Chevron in Sydney, the
latter having for many years unquestion-
ably had the finest stock of salable and
maturing wine in Australia.
However, I agreed with myself not
to disagree too much. The book con-
cludes with pointed and telling remarks
about wine and food clubs and buying
and storing wine. In all, a most ably
written and comprehensive survey of
wine for not only the beginner but also
the wine lover who is still questing
after the beast of information.
The Graham Kerr Cook Book. Graham
Kerr. A. H. & A. W. Reed. $7.50.
Graham Kerr is undoubtedly a bril-
liant man an able promoter, an
objective businessman, charming per-
sonality, and a convincing talker. Yet
there are many who decry his culinary
ability. I have heard many people who
can whip up three fairly good dishes
castigate Kerr for his lack of know-
ledge.
I must insist that this doesn’t occur
amongst most food professionals. I
know very few people who have met
Kerr and talked to him about food who
are not in awe of his most comprehen-
sive knowledge and feeling for food.
Tony Bohdan, regarded by many as
the leading food man in Australia (my-
self among them), states, “Kerr has
many abilities, not the least of which
is his tremendous sense of timing, his
imagination, and his palate. He is a
master of blending.”
Now, perhaps for the first time, Kerr
has overcome something of the glamor-
boy image that he has to produce a
first-class authoritative cook book. It is
almost antiseptic in its frill-less
approach. Though there are some excel-
lent color plates, he does not over-
indulge in them, and certainly does not
ramble on with endless anecdotes about
himself. There are 217 different
methods and recipes enumerated, and
also comments on cheese and wine.
Best of all is the visual registration he
is able to impart by the use of endless
photographs of hands doing the work.
I suppose there are several hundred
pictures of his hands and only one or
two of his face. The book is made to
be used in a kitchen, and has an excel-
lent cover and show offset paper that
will stand up to any kind of wear. It is
held together with a thick copper spiral
binding which allows the book to be
flipped over quickly without apparent
damage. However, there is no thumb
index.
Cook books are strange things. I am
told that they are second only to
religious works in sales and they tend
to become more and more elaborate and
less and less fundamental. I am glad
that Kerr returns so often to funda-
mentals. Being an enthusiastic omelet-
tier, I was intrigued to follow carefully
how he makes his omelets. Of course
I don’t agree, but that’s not the point.
Kerr’s cook book is undoubtedly here
to stay.
Finally, I must put in a little plug
for my own book, “Cellarmaster’s
Guide to Australian Wines.” Reviewers
around the country have been very kind
and have stressed the “fun” angle of
my writing. Well, wine is fun learn
more to enjoy more but never for-
get that it’s just a drink. The scratch
golfer is unhappy with a two-over-par
round that would give most golfers
great joy.

McWILLIAM’S Private Bin 56
1965 Lexia
This is a tight, dry, white table wine made
from the grape variety known as Lexia,
and was produced at McWilliam's Robin-
vale Winery in Victoria. During fermen-
tation the temperature was maintained
below 55° F., and this has helped to retain
in the wine a very powerful aroma of the
grape, as well as a tremendous volume of
Flavour. An ideal accompaniment to most
foods, particularly seasoned fish dishes,
white meats and poultry. It was awarded
a Gold Medal at the 1966 International
Wine Fair held at Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.
MCWILLIAM’S Private Bln 35
1963 Claret
The Hermitage grapes used to produce
this wine were picked exclusively from
our Hanwood Vineyards in the Riverina
district of New South Wales. Here, con-
trolled irrigation, accompanied by special
pruning techniques, helps to produce
grapes which give a “claret style," light
and delicate, but at the same time full
of flavour of the fruit and with a firm
tannin finish.
It was awarded a Silver Medal in the
International Wine Fair at Ljubljana,
Yugoslavia, in 1966.

1965 Moselle
With its fragrant aroma and its delicate
fruity flavour, both enhanced by a slight
effervescence, this wine has the charac-
teristic qualities expected in a good
Moselle. These qualities make it most
suitable for serving with fish, salads and
all light dishes.
In the Queensland Royal National Show
of 1966, it was awarded a Bronze Medal
in the Vintage 1965 Medium Dry White,
Moselle Class.

1963 Burgundy
Made from a blend of Hermitage and
Grenache grapes grown in the Riverina
District of N.S.W., this wine has the deli-
cate aroma of the fruit, is full-bodied and
has a soft, round palate.
It is an ideal accompaniment with meat
dishes and cheese.
In the Queensland Royal National Show
of 1966 it was awarded a Bronze Medal
in the Dry Red Table (Export) Class.
ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Nothing Very Dramatic
By PATRICIA ROLFE
IN some genuine ways and in some
fairly spurious ones, 1966 has been
a more lively and interesting year
for drama than any for some years
past. However, progress by comparison
with what happens in other fields, even
in some of the other arts, is something
like the first faltering steps out of the
slime on to dry land.
Companies from four States toured
the Commonwealth. Sydney’s Jane
Street Theatre presented five new Aus-
tralian plays, including two one-acters.
The Union Repertory production of
“Private Yuk Objects” travelled, but
not very well, from Melbourne to Syd-
ney. Almost any writer you can think
of was commissioned to write a play,
and almost everyone who can read or
write was writing one for the ABC’s
“Australian Playhouse.”
Even in the unsubsidised non-
commercial, or what you might call the
tourist-class, theatre there has been in-
creased activity. Alexander Archdale
hopefully launched his Community
Theatre at Killara, Sydney. This theatre
is remarkable in many ways, and per-
haps most in that, for what seems the
first time, practical financial help in the
form of nominal rental came from a
local council. Melbourne’s Emerald
Hill survived the loss of Wal Cherry
and acquired Robin Ramsay, with
George Whaley, and a lively 1967 pro-
gram. The Sydney Q Group, after
coasting along with lunch-hour presen-
tations, had a shot at evening perform-
ances.
All this might be healthy expansion,
or it might merely be the insane multi-
plication of diseased cells before the
whole body theatrical expires. Drama
may be beginning to be self-sustaining,
or it might be like the donkey which
almost learnt to live on air but at the
last moment died.
(On page 29 of this issue, Charles
Higham talks about our lack of “stars”
in the theatre.)
The interstate theatre tour, organ-
ised by the Elizabethan, was a curious
venture, one which could only have
been devised by a committee. The
attempt seems to have been to show,
in as conspicuous a fashion as possible,
that the Trust was “doing something”
for drama.
The season operated on a very tight
budget. There seems to have been no
allocation for advance publicity, so that
each company went almost cold into
each city. None of the companies was
permitted to take the producer of its
play on tour, unless he was performing,
akin, perhaps, to a sporting team going
overseas without its manager. Nor were
there any understudies an immense
strain on players away from home for
three months.
After the interstate theatre season, the
Elizabethan seemed to withdraw even
further from the field of drama and,
of late, even further from reality.
Of the four subsidised theatres which
toured, the National Theatre of Perth
may seem on sight to be best off. They
have their own theatre, seating 720, and
are the only company which has a
handful of players under six or 12
months’ contract (although the Union
Repertory plans to go back to this next
year). If the present director, Edgar
Metcalfe, had more money he would
spend it on actors’ salaries.
However, Perth actors suffer greatly
because few companies, even those of
the big commercial managements, cross
the Nullarbor Plain. Members of the
company see only what amateur groups
in their city offer, or what may turn
up at the Festival of'Perth. It is because
of this that the company’s present dir-
ector, Edgar Metcalfe, leaves at the
end of the year.
Adelaide has a totally different set
of problems. Here, the South Australiaa
Theatre Company did not grow up
naturally in its community but was
imposed from above by the Elizabethan.
John Tasker was sent from Sydney,
with not much money and no theatre,
to set up Government-sponsored drama
in that city.
In 15 months the South Australian
Theatre Company had four homes
Theatre 62, the teachers’ college theatre,
Union Hall, and the Bonython Hall
(the Bonythons, as Mr. Tasker says,
made a lot of money, but they did not

make it in upholstery). The company
has little hope of even another tempor-
ary refuge until well into next year. “If
only we had Hobart’s Theatre Royal
or they had our actors,” is Mr/Tasker’s
cry. Last financial year the company
received $17,000 from the Trust. This
year, Mr. Tasker has said, he has $4OOO,
apart from his salary.
Mr. Tasker, who will repeat his “The
Royal Hunt of the Sun” at the Perth
Festival, remains buoyant. He looks
to Adelaide and South Australia for
long-term help.
Brisbane as yet has no Government-
sponsored drama company, but a few
months ago the Elizabethan apparently
decided to “do something” for drama
there. The Elizabethan toyed with a
plan of getting the three established
amateur groups, the Arts, the Twelfth
Night, and the Repertory, to combine
and, with some financial help, operate
from the Arts. The Trust may have
lit on this idea after its Adelaide experi-
ence of trying to establish a theatre
with no building and almost no money.
However, not surprisingly, the groups
could see little advantage to anyone
except the Trust in this.
In Sydney and Melbourne the needs
and achievements of drama are more
complicated. The main sources of com-
plication are the liveliness and in-
transigence of non-subsidised, non-
commercial theatres in these cities and
by the fact that actors in Sydney and
Melbourne do earn a living or
aspire to at their profession.
In Melbourne and Sydney, Govern-
ment money for drama has so far
merely made life less uncertain for a
handful of permanent employees at the
Old Tote and Union Repertory. But
the standards of production and choice
of plays of these theatres are not mark-
edly different from what non-subsidised
groups do. The subsidised theatres may
claim they have “more expertise,” but
the unaided theatre can say, “just more
money.”
There seems a good deal of ambi-
tion and logic in the University of
N.S.W.’s drama complex. NIDA is
turning out splendid students, the Old
Tote hopes for a larger theatre, and in
the long run to leap over the wall and
become something more than a Uni-
versity theatre. But at the moment
what it does isn’t very different from
what other groups do. Some, experi-
enced actors show a notable lack of
enthusiasm for its conditions. It cannot,
because of its size, get through to
enough people to mean anything. For
its usual six weeks’ season its maximum
audience is about 7000, about as many
people who see some of the Q Group’s
lunch-hour plays.
The answer, of course, is not to take
away from the Old Tote and the
Union Repertory but to give them con-
siderably more money. From actors’
-point of view they must become com-
panies to which they can aspire and
companies for which they can. work
without distraction. From the commun-
ity’s point of view, they must be com-
panies which provide enrichment for
the individual and shed lustre on the
city.
The Old Tote’s success of the year
was probably its Australian plays at
Jane Street, although the local play
success of the year must be Robert
Wales’ “The Cell,” which had a sym-
pathetic treatment by Peter Summerton
at the Independent, an out-of-town sea-
son at Newcastle (through the muni-
ficence of lottery-winner Robert Levis
of the Independent) and a season at
Canberra. It has since had productions
in Adelaide, Melbourne, and Brisbane.
QNE other development in 1966 which,
if it moves in the right direction
may begin to work effectively for
drama, is the N.S.W. Professional
Drama Council, which had its begin-
nings at the Independent Theatre,
Sydney. This represents theatres favored
by the Elizabethan and those which get
no financial help as well as one or two
commercial managements. The council
may be able to make it clear* that non-
commercial theatres, no matter what
their financial position, have a lot of
problems in common to which answers
must be found, answers which might
never be disclosed by a national-level
inquiry on the arts in general.
Similar councils may later be estab-
lished in other States. However, in New
South Wales, where the Government is
dispensing $200,000 from Opera lot-
teries each year, it may enable drama
to speak with a stronger voice. The
committee, set up under the chairman-
ship of the übiquitous Dr. Coombs, to
recommend disbursements to the State
Government, has no one whose particu-
lar knowledge or interest is drama. The
composition of the committee is depress-
ingly similar to those twin failures, the
Opera House Committee and the Eliza-
bethan Trust Board, so who could
doubt that someone needs to speak up
more strongly.

ART
Sink or Swim
Tom Gleghom. Hungry Horse Gallery,
Sydney.
ALTHOUGH Tom Gleghorn had
a one-man show of drawings in
Sydney in 1960, he is only now
having his first Sydney one-man show
of paintings; no longer strewing the
country with what Robert Hughes once
castigated, for some reason or other,
as “little gems,” Gleghom presents eight
large, sink-or-swim works.
It is a curious situation for one who,
by example and teaching, influenced
quite a few painters and who has won
20 major art prizes including the 1961
Helena Rubinstein Scholarship; it is
clear that the longer an artist is among
the storm troops, and the more medals
he wears, the more obvious a target he
is. He is expected to have something
positive and new to say, for the days
when an exhibition could be a collec-
tion of aesthetic objects have gone; an
avant-garde exhibition is thought of as
a manifesto in paint and certainly must
not look like a series of successes and
old favorites from the past. The diffi-
culty is that unless a painter makes a
complete break he is likely to be in-
terpreted in terms of his past, his inno-
vations and development diminished by
the desire to see a logical sequence in
his work.
In these eight clamorous canvases the-
past hardly modifies the present; ele-
ments of abstracted landscapes and
beam-like structures are still there along
with customary sudden flurries of paint,
exuberant and desperate splashes of
color, and juxtapositions of boiling reds
and foaming, cool whites; but much has
been discarded.
like many self-taught
painters, was once so much occupied
with techniques that he spoke as though
art and technical virtuosity were one;
he rang with zest and assurance the
changes on texture, impasto, staining,
air-brush application, and on the effects
of wax and PVA media. His early work
grew from Cezanne’s facets of light
which Gleghorn bound in black hori-
zontal-vertical grids, which became in-
creasingly spiky and restless. As his
interest in religious paintings grew,
these cloisonne works looked more like
stained glass. He was to grow less
rigid, to adopt the looser, romantically
sombre style of Sydney’s version of
abstract expressionism, to which he had
probably been led by the dashing calli-
graphy of his drawings that had some-
thing of the urgency of Hartung and
the formidable blackness of Soulages.
Though he has in prints, drawings, and
several fine paintings recently honored
the funereal majesty of the Spanish
school, now radiance has utterly con-
founded gloom and pessimism.
Though expressionist voices are not
dimmed, he has turned to the light,
bright color of English abstraction, to

Sutherland’s acidulous hues, to Helen
Frankenthaler’s glowing amorphous
stains and to Hundertwasser’s curving,
parallel ribbons; in fact, as though
Munch had gone abstract. These influ-
ences have been subordinated to a dis-
tinct and personal vision, and, unlike
Sutherland and Hundertwasser, he is
little concerned with decorating his
themes with beguiling additives.
His former concern with structure,
as though a painting were an armature,
has been replaced by an urgent fluidity,
with vast floods and rivers of color that
don’t lose their amplitude of gesture
and all-embracing rhythm when they
collide in waves of paint. Though he
still uses some beam-like forms
notably in “Souvenir I” he binds his
stains and open areas with undulating,
parallel bands of bright color; in the
12ft.-long “Centennial Park Painting”
the coalescing ribbons made a grandiose,
Hundertwasser meander from right to
left through free-floating, incandescent
areas; in “Bloom,” which has a solid
slab of black on the left, the ribbons
of color on the right droop like melting
petals. The ribbons are like Morris
Louis bands of color that, having melted
into one another, suddenly freeze solid,
for despite all the fluidity and elan,
Gleghorn tends to fix forms and colors
with a curious finality.
It is the subtle play of fixity and
amorphousness that makes “The First
Two Trees in Centennial Park” such
a brilliant success; a steaming, vaporous
centre surges against two sides of bril-
liant green sliced with sharp pinks.
The “sky” is almost a cliche for calm-
ness and the bottom is pleasantly decor-
ated with alternating verticles of mild
colors; it is painting rising far above
its eclectic origins.
“Mediterranean Souvenir,” bought by
the Newcastle Gallery, is in his older,
purer abstract-expressionist manner of
somewhat indeterminate forms and
might lead one to think that Gleghorn
had opted for a jostling, loose geometry,
but his large areas of uniform color are
as closely related to abstract expression-
ism as are A 1 Held’s that were seen in
the touring show of American abstract
water-colors this year; Gleghorn is more
concerned with the direction of masses,
with disquiet and his work still
embodies the anxiety that Rosenberg
sees as the true mark of action painting.

is still one' of thfe company’s major
triumphs. With Kathleen Gorham at
her considerable best it is better now
than in its original form in that Karl
Welander is much better cast as the
fisherman than Garth Welch was. This
is one case where the best dancer is not
necessarily the best for the part.
The rest of the program cannot be
condemned too strongly. “Jazz Suite”
is a simplified version in black and
white of “Jazz Spectrum,” which had
little to offer beyond its color. What
remains could have been justified only-
as a display piece for technical virtu-
osity, but for the fact that the chore-
ography avoids difficult enchainements-
like the plague. If at least its simplicities
were performed in unison one could
admire the precision of the ensemble:
but I have rarely seen dancers more out
of step with each other.
The collection of dances described
as “highlights” is an insult to the audi-
ence. It would not be out of place in.
a second-rate ensemble touring the
British provinces. No major company
(and the Australian Ballet is a major
company) stages “Divertisements” like
these. To top it all they are, with very
few exceptions, badly performed. How
little care has been taken over them by
the artistic directors is shown by the

is called Friend Ed.
Her decision is also approved by John
Steinbeck, who presents it as morally im-

could be viewed as an act of deliberate

that such things are not important. As
Friend Ed explains to Joe Saul at the
end: all men should be prepared to
regard themselves as fathers to all chil-
dren and not take too narrow a view
of paternity. Quod erat demonstran-
dum.
In order, presumably, to illustrate
the universality of his theme, Steinbeck
puts his four characters in a different
setting in each of the three acts. In
Act I they belong to a circus, in Act II
they are on the land, and in Act 111
they are all at sea. These metamor-
phoses do something, but not enough,
to conceal the fact that there is very
little happening in this play.
The child is conceived in Act I
and born in Act 111. Act 11, the
interim period, in which Joe Saul
carries on as though he were having
the baby himself, seemed to last almost
nine months.
After three turgid acts of this humor-
less, sentimental, and ill-written drama,
in which the language is at once in-
flated and flaccid, I found it difficult
to distinguish my hostility to the
characters from my attitude to the
actors. Owen Weingott as Joe Saul
emotes powerfully for three acts. I
found it impressive but overpowering.
Lorrae Desmond also seemed over-
powered, as well she might, by all
this mother-to-be worship. Her per-
formance would need to be on a
larger scale to match Owen, Weingott.
James Scullin gives an excellent per-
formance as Friend Ed, quiet but
beautifully controlled.
Hayes Gordon’s production gives
evidence of hard work and attention
to detail, but I wish it had been ex-
pended on a more deserving play.

MUSIC

Hollier, piano. Conservatorium, Sydney.
THE return of expatriate perform-
ing musicians always presents
difficulties in forming an appro-
priate critical approach. The tendency
is, of course, to expect far too much
from holders of fresh overseas ex-
perience. We would like to see ex-
cellent Australian musicians return as
seasoned international professionals,
but as has been the case in the past,
we often overestimate the advantages
which continental experience may
bring. Raymond Myers and Donald
Hollier gave, in their recital last week,
a useful demonstration of the varied
manner by which such experience can
influence the artist.
Mr. Myers is an obvious disciple of
traditional fortissimo bel canto school.
Without exaggeration one can say that
his must be the loudest voice to have
been projected over an Australian
audience for many, many years. As
he climbed into higher registers of his
range, the sheer volume produced was
sufficient to generate a definite sensa-
tion of pain in the eardrums. The
Six Schubert songs he chose afforded
too many opportunities for these vocal
batterings, and the softer passages were
appreciated more as blessed relief than
for the qualities which they un-
doubtedly possessed. Verdi, perhaps
the arch villian of the loud-hailer style,
was represented in Myers’ program by
two arias—“Eri Tu” from “A Masked
Ball” and the celebrated “Vile Race of
Courtiers” from “Rigoletto.”
Throughout the final half of the pro-
gram (Bach, Schubert, Verdi) I found
my attention wandering from the singer
to the accompanist. Donald Hollier,
best remembered by people with an in-
terest in music education as the teacher
who put Newington on its musical feet,
provided a supporting contribution in
his playing which is rare in vocal re-
citals. Myers and Hollier are more of a
team than any other similar combina-
tion I have heard, and Hollier especially
gave evidence of an understanding of
his role, which was truly of international
standard. His technique is unusually
fluid, his phrasing immaculate, and his
control qf dynamics (in striking con-
trast to Myers’) is outstanding. The
brackets of Ives and Mahler, which
constituted the substance of the second
half, were particularly demanding of
the accompanist, and Hollier proved as
effective here as he did throughout the
evening..
Both the Mahler and the Ives songs
forced Myers to an acceptable level of
volume, and in doing so helped to
reveal the most attractive features of his
style. Sensitive and rhythmically-
flexible, his singing faithfully expressed
the peculiarly detailed emotional con-
cerns of each song,

Sub-world
The Comedy Man. Director, Alvin
Rakoff. Savoy, Sydney.
Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number! Dir-
ector, George Marshall. Regent,
Sydney.
“T USED to be a first-rate failure,”
says the “serious” actor, excusing
his descent into the profitable, but
shameful, world of TV commercials.
“Now you’re a second-rate success,”
snaps his disgusted ex-mistress.
I’m afraid that “The Comedy Man,”
in which this exchange occurs, can only
be described as a second-rate failure;
a pity, for it has enough good in it to
make its faffs from grace the more exas-
perating. Its generally good perform-
ances, some sharp dialogue, a nice eye
for absurdity, and some genuinely
touching moments don’t quite add up.
It is the story of a provincial actor
who comes to London to try his luck,
is unable to find work to his liking,
and, unwilling to do any other,
finally sells his soul temporarily to
Mammon in the form of TV com-
mercials. The script is uncompromising
in its realistic dealing with the seedier
aspects of theatrical life, but over-
romantic in its view of an actor’s
“integrity” surely very few, if any,
actors would be so desperately ashamed
of earning good money, even if it were
as “Mister Honeybreath.”
Though “The L-Shaped Room” and
“The Small, Sad World of Sammy
Lee” did it more powerfully, the film
does convey the seedy atmosphere of
London’s shabby sub-world of cheap
bed-sitters, dubious pubs, and cafes; and
Kenneth More gives a fine, varied per-
formance, with his aging boy’s face
subtly changing from desperate jaunti-
ness to sagging hopelessness, while in
the “Honeybreath” commercials he gives
a deft and funny series of parodies of
so many of his former movie roles.
Probably the film’s main fault is in
its warring viewpoints: first, that the
so-called glamor of the theatre is a lie
(the film makes an actor’s life look so
unpleasant that it is a wonder there are
any actors left), and second, that actors
are so wedded to the theatre that they’d
rather starve than go commercial. Now
honestly, would anybody?
Perhaps film distributors over-estimate
the effects on filmgoers of the season of
goodwill. Even the greatest softie is
unlikely to let the spirit of Christmas
make him indulgent toward pictures
like “Boy, Did I Get A Wrong
Number!” a sadly soggy comedy with
trumped-up situations and flabby dia-
logue. Bob Hope and Phyllis Differ,
both of whom can handle good, or even
mediocre, lines quite brilliantly, work
nobly for a while, then seem to give
up; Elke Sommer, who has no comic
talent whatever and whose figure is by
no means as “copious” as the script-
writers tell us, is no help at all. Add
a lot of meaningless noise and some
startlingly vulgar color design and, boy,
have you got a flop!

RECORDS
Gaining by Delay
Die Walkuere (Wagner). Nilsson, Hot-
ter, King, Crespin, Ludwig, Vienna
Philharmonic Orchestra (Solti).
Decca SET 312/6.
THIS set completes the Nibelungen
cycle recorded by Decca, surely
one of the most formidable and
most successful undertakings in the
history of recorded music. Of the four
Ring operas, “Die Walkuere” is easily
the most popular and most readily
accepted by non-Wagnerians. It is,
therefore, the obvious first choice out
of the four, though it was the last
recorded. I think that holding it back
until the best possible cast became
available was a wise decision. The
greatest gain by the delay is in the Sieg-
mund of James King, a great improve-
ment on the Heldentenoere of the first-
recorded operas. Since the Melchiors
finally died out there has been a great
dearth of Wagner tenors and Germany
is now in the unenviable position of
having to import the best three from
across the Atlantic: Jon Vickers, Jess
Thomas, and now James King. I don’t
claim that the newcomer eclipses the
other two, but he is as ideal a Siegmund
as we are likely to find today.
The rest of the cast is as good or
better, though I have reservations about
Hans Hotter’s Wotan in spite of the
glowing reviews he has received. He
is noble, convincing, and probably un-
beatable in the part. Yet the voice
waves in an unmistakably aging manner,
an unfortunate weakness in a supposed
immortal. But the stars of this set, and
of its predecessors, are undoubtedly
Georg Solti and the sound engineers
directed by John Culshaw, the first man
to make a name directing microphones
and mixers. Solti’s conducting almost
wipes out the deserts of boredom
between the oasis of beauty which Wag-
ner’s opponents are wont to quote and
requote. I have my doubts about the
uncuttability of Wagner’s works, but
if they were always conducted like
this who would want to cut them?

Gods in Sandshoes
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
All Day Saturday. Colin Maclnnes.
Mac Gibbon and Kee. $3.15.
COLIN MacINNES is often spoken
of as an Australian writer, but,
of course, he was only educated
here and neither of his parents was an
Australian. Although Mr. Maclnnes
spent some formative years here, one
would • regard him ultimately as an
Englishman rather than as an Aus-
tralian. This novel is set roughly dur-
ing the period of his education when
Colin Maclnnes was in this country.
It embodies many of the attitudes of
the Lindsay-Hugh McCrae period of
vitalism in Australian literature of the
’twenties. The hero or anti-hero, how-
ever you like to regard him, is Norman
Culley, a crude and cruel young
bounder from the city who arrives
one Saturday on a station known as
“Cootamundra.” Within a couple of
hours of his arrival young Norman has
already achieved a conquest down by
the dam in the best vitalistic fashion.
He strides through the rest of the book
shoving other people out of the way
and eventually achieving his aims at
the finish.
The Australians appearing in the
book are never portrayed as heroes,
and they are shown as what they are,
brash, vital, and athletic people who
are pretty ignorant on the whole, and
cynical, but at a deeper level are
shown to have an enthusiasm which
has died in the ancient world. Colin
Maclnnes writes: “These people were in
a sense glamorous ... at rare moments
in history, by a series of accidents
never to be repeated, there flower
societies in which the cult of' happiness
is paramount . . .” Norman Culley is
described as “lithe, tough, mindless,
and delinquent . . . and his face, as
he gazed at the water, was of one, like
Odysseus, who would conquer it despite
its power.”
,r pHE other central character in the
book is Helen Bailey. Of her Colin
Maclnnes writes: “If some Pallas
Athene were required to bestow an
ultimate grace on the proceedings, this
role was fulfilled to perfection by Helen
Bailey: not eating much herself (and
drinking nothing), passing from group
to group radiating reassurance . . .”
All of Helen’s entrances have un-
conscious drama: She is a beautiful,
middle-aged, and childless wife whose
marriage has failed because of her
romantic frigidity, but when Norman
arrives on the scene she falls violently
in love with him. However, she plays
her gambit too late in life, and she
fails and tries to commit suicide. As she
is running toward the, radio tower from
which she intends to jump, Colin
Maclnnes describes the countryside
across which she is running as being
“old, doomed country that accepted
you but never greeted . . It is a
measure of his detachment from his
characters that at stich a critical point
he is able to comment on the country-
side and generalise about the nature
of Australia.
In essence this book is therefore de-
tached, while at the same time
romanticising. I might add that I am
not trying, to knock the romanticising
of characters and places in novels. It is,
I feel, a desirable attribute in a novelist.
People do hav6 mystery and drama,
and it is one of Colin Maclnnes’ chief
strengths as a novelist that he is able
to convey this mystery and drama. At
his highest moments of drama, how-
ever, an element of tragi-comedy
generally slips in.
It is difficult to take Helen’s jump
from the radio tower seriously, nor do
I think the author does. This whole
episode has a peculiarly dated and un-
real flavor, like a scene from an old
film in which the actress has too much
belladonna in her eyes. I suspect that
Colin MacInnes
Colin Maclnnes would like to achieve
real high drama and tragedy without
any element of comedy, but he misses
out on the great moments, although he
remains a very accomplished performer
on the lesser slopes of Parnassus. His
muse is a muse of failure rather than of
tragedy. Three of his main characters
fail in their emotional relationships.
The sad and bitter-sweet final scene
of the book is well done, and the whole
book fits all its plots and sub-plots
together very efficiently. The book is
called “All Day Saturday” because
the action takes place in one day and
observes the classical rules of place,
time, and action. Perhaps this observa-
tion of the classical rules by the author
is a joke on his part and a carry-
through of some of the classical themes
implicit in the book.

The Autobiography of Malcolm X,
Hutchinson. $5.65.
__ _ , tat
Malcolm X speaks. Seeker & War-?
burg. s4.bu.
IF you want to know why the novel
is in the doldrums, read the auto-
biography of Malcolm X. Ours is
an age in which the drama of fact
overpowers invention and, thanks to
the speed of communications and the
skill of the documentarist, it comes to
us almost as soon as it is enacted in
life. Hardly does Malcolm X vacate
the stage of reality when he is resur-
rected in a book of such harrowing
immediacy that, next to it, creative
imagination seems pale, not to say
irrelevant. One day a great writer may
put him at the centre of a great play,
but meanwhile what story can survive
in the shadow of his?
While the man was alive, the atti-
tude to him of the Press, including the
Australian, was one of puzzled con-
tempt. He was a racist, a promoter of
violence and, joke of jokes, a Muslim.
It apparently did not occur to many
that one of the lessons of this epoque
is that intelligently applied violence
pays: why should it not pay in Harlem,
when it has paid in Dublin, in Haifa,
- n ][S3'i cos i aj a nd the Lord knows where
else? Is it so unreasonable for a.Negro
to believe that he will only start get-
ting what he wants what he bitterly
n L eeds ~ he P, uts j ll5 S hetto t 0
J he torch? The results do not prove
him wrong, considering the amount of
anti-discrimination legislation brought
forward since his struggle took a more
milltant turn > backlash or no backlash,
Gandhi, precursor of Martin Luther
King, shaped the Quit India Movement,
but in the finish the Karachi and
Bombay naval mutinies were the straws
that broke the lion’s back. And as to
the Islamic pepper, that’s not exclusive
to the American stew. Throughout
Africa Christ is retreating before
Mohammed, because, rightly or wrongly,
Christianity is identified with colonial-
ism - So there was nothing implausible
or far-out exotic about Malcolm X.
He was a charismatic leader, like
Tschombe or Subhas Bose, a direct-
action man of the truest cast,
His language seems strange to us, but


his people understood it, even, or especi-
ally, when he likened “Whitey” to the
devil, or when he proclaimed that
civilisation began with the Negro. He
broke many a liberal heart, but the
most fascinating thing about him was
something quite different: how he
ceased to be a color fanatic. This
came at the end, after his pilgrimage
to-Mecca, which brought him a spiri-
tual rebirth. Shortly before he was shot
dead in the Audubon Ballroom in down-
town New York, he declared that inter-
racial marriage was a private affair, and
appealed for the help of all men of
political goodwill to advance the
Negro’s cause.
This autobiography was told to, and
partly written by, a brilliant Negro
journalist, Alex Haley, whose own intro-
duction delineates Malcolm X with
subtlety and precision. At first Malcolm
X did not want to co-operate, but when
discussion touched on the subject of his
mother, who spent 27 years in a mental
institution, his resistance collapsed.
From there on the record unfolds as
a self-revelation of unparalleled force,
something worthy of a James Baldwin.
It must be read by all who wish to
understand the tragedy of Black
America.
It seems he never won the confidence
of the majority of Negroes, perhaps
because his approach was empirical in
the extreme; he had a strategy but
hardly an ideology, though in some
ways he spoke like a primitive Marxist.
He was the son of a radical Baptist
minister who may have been killed by
Klansmen—the matter remains in doubt
—and whose house was burned down
just before Malcolm’s birth. His
mother had to rear seven children,
mostly on public relief, and what edu-
cation he received he obtained through
the devotion of a half-sister. The
darkest slums of Detroit and New York
formed his restless, passionate, and de-
termined character. He learned easily,
had an interest in history and philology,
but his training would have fitted him
best for the profession of a dope pedlar,
pimp, gambler, or thief. He followed
all these vocations, as well as several
related ones, procured for white deviants
and organised robberies. Villon could
have been his poet.
In 1944 he began a seven-year jail
apprenticeship. It was in the peniten-
tiary that he first heard about a certain
Elijah Muhammad, chief of The
Nation of Islam, and Islam Mosque
Inc., who was to become his second
father. The book does not make very
clear what Elijah taught, apart from
the most aggressive racial pride and
individual regeneration through self-
discipline and self-denial. His followers
claim to have salvaged thousands of
drug addicts and social wrecks.
They certainly salvaged Malcolm,
who attached himself to The Honorable
Elijah without any reserve or qualifica-
tion. He stuck to him for nearly 20
years, during which he developed into
a masterly agitator and orator, unloved
by moderate Negro leaders and hated
by all but a handful of whites. The
paramilitary Nation of Islam was his
life, Elijah Muhammad almost his god.
It is a flaw in this book that it fails
to tell us enough about Elijah, a figure
quite as significant, but much more
secretive and sinister, as his disciple.
Finally, Malcolm X lost faith in him.
His idol was begetting offspring on his
secretaries, justifying his lapses from
the Law of the Prophet by the plea
that he had to experience everything
the biblical heroes had also experienced.
But Malcolm X went beyond personal
criticism. He seems to have realised that
a wider, more flexible policy was needed
to win over the urbanised Negro.
Already his was the most clearly heard
Negro voice in the North, and he com-
menced to fashion a rival movement.
The break arrived, and he was pro-
nounced a renegade and outlaw.
Then came the pilgrimage and, at
last, death at the hands of Elijah’s
assassins. In spite of all warnings and
in spite of the recent gutting of his
home, protection proved inadequate.
He had been losing old friends as fast
as he enrolled new converts, and even
Cassius Clay, who emerges here as by
no means a fool, did not stay the course.
I T is a tragic story, of course, because
there is no end to confusions, un-
resolved dilemmas, moral and political
impasses, Withal, it is a kind of Passion,
a kind of Calvary. Malcolm X was not
in the country during “the long hot
summer” of 1964, nor was he the
instigator of its violence. No one man
could have been. He was still maturing
when he was slain, and while it seems
most improbable that he would ever
have become a moderate, it is almost
certain that his ascent had not reached
its apex. He was 40 years old.
Capably edited and glossaried by
George Breitman, his speeches, state-
ments, and interviews bring out the
sharp flavor of the man. He was tre-
mendously articulate, whether at the
Malcolm X
expense of white freedom riders, whorrt
he respected but did not value as effec-
tive, or of Jews, whom he charged with
usually being among the first to leave a
desegregated neighborhood (but I do
not think he was an anti-Semite), or
of those who hoped too much from the
March on Washington and the eloquence
of people like Walter Reuther.
This is how he spoke:
“We have made advancement in this-
country only when this country was
under pressure from forces above and
beyond its control.” . . . “Look right now
what’s going on in and around Saigon
and Hanoi and the Congo . . . But
for. all the violence they display at
the international level, when you and
I want but a little bit of freedom, we’re
supposed to be non-violent.” . . . “Let us
practise brotherhood among ourselves,
and then if others are for practising
brotherhood with us, we’re for prac-
tising it with them also. But I don’t
think we should run around trying to-
love someone who doesn’t love us.”
The Lake
My companions shout and rush down slopes as steep
as any gamut of emotions, leap
upon the shingles and balance at the brink
as if they hope to scoop the color, drink
and drown heroic in that unnatural blue.
Yet I stand back in the scrub we’ve struggled through,
needing a frame to recognise perfection,
needing to fit the world to my constriction,
needing to curb myself with self-control
as if my duty were devising whole
perspective laws for every circumstance.
And they, at the edge of that sublime expanse,
laugh with greed; then their faces turn to me
bright with the failure of transparency.

The Race of Avengers
By GEOFFREY FAIRBAIRN
Andre Malraux. The Indo-China Adven-
ture. Walter Langlois. Praeger. $8.55.
IT is necessary to be honest these
days; particularly in these days.
The air has become so infested
with the ululations of the professional
demonstrators and the plangency of dis-
tressed students that it is difficult pub-
licly to discuss the problems of Vietnam
with the critical positiveness required.
It has from the very beginning been
the purpose of the professional “pro-
testers,” those who work for a Viet
Cong victory, to confuse issues to the
extent of subverting national purpose-
fulness. The campaign has now de-
teriorated to the intellectual level of a
“Bogotazo,” the kind of political nihil-
ism found on occasion in Latin America
and described by an observer: “Crowds
shouted, ‘Viva la muerte,’ and an old
woman was seen sitting outside the
British Embassy ripping the keys out
of a typewriter one by one.” In such
an atmosphere it is easy to become
less aware of certain background fac-
tors in Vietnamese history than one
should be; easy indeed to be moved
inadvertently into making impermissible
simplifications in order to try to dispel
this poison-dust cloud of vicious
obfuscation.
,r JTHIS dreary and desperately worthy
book is an altogether useful antidote
to such shortfalling. Though too much
of it is devoted to a dull recapitulation
of the events surrounding M. Andre
Malraux’s trial in the ’twenties for re-
moving statuary from Bantaey Serai in
Cambodia and to a minute examina-
tion of much trivia appearing in the
Saigon newspaped he later edited, it
does contain a number of the insights
of a great writer into the nature of
French colonialism, which was a quite
exceedingly unlovely thing.
Though it was this period, which
included visits to Hong Kong and Kuo-
mintang China, that gave Malraux the
material for his “Man’s Fate,” the one
great novel about Communists of a
Promethean rather than Leninist kind
Malraux appears at the time to have
been advocating a transformation of
French colonial government, not its
destruction. His journalism is that of a
progressive small “1” liberal of those
days before this attitude of mind be-
came Stalinoid and lined itself up
from the Moscow trials onwards
with the executioners instead of their
victims ... a tradition which exists
into the present day, a tradition of
which Malraux has never for a moment
been a part.
His descriptions of French colonial
rule under pressure are in nowise
propaganda but the observations of a
man of courage outraged by senseless
cruelty. During the repressions of
1931, a thuggish sergeant of the
Foreign Legion, one Perrier, was mur-
dered during a spontaneous outbreak
of terrified violence. This is what fol-
lowed. “It’s the little tropical station,
always the same, with its projecting
roof, its heat, its rain, and its tall
palm trees like wolf-heads. However,
to the isolated tree planted like a flag-
pole across the installation, a living
Annamite (Vietnamese) is tied, the
severed head of a friend in his hands
. . . The two Legionnaires question him.
Visualise that interrogation of a bound
man, a severed head held tightly in
his hands, by the two Legionnaires, one
of whom will admit at the trial that he
was completely drunk, in the centre of
shuttered native huts, where eyes are
glued to every crack . . . He doesn’t
reply. So he’s cut down with one
or two bullets in the skull . . .” Others
were beaten to death; one was castrated
with scissors and a saw; a hapless Viet-
namese blundered inadvertently in upon
the scene and was bludgeoned to death
with empty wine bottles. The Legion-
naires were acquitted. “Only the dead
are not acquitted,” Malraux wrote at
that time.
But the dead were acquitted many
years later at a place in the Thai
country of north-west Vietnam, a place
called Dien-Bien-Phu. There the peas-
ant soldiers of the People’s Army
“took” the men of the Legion and
humiliated the survivors through the
agency of Russian newsreel cameras,
which sent around the world a film of
beaten white men moving along the
dusty road like felons. It really is very
necessary to be honest, to be accurate,
about the nature of the struggle in
Vietnam today. Neither the fellow
travelling propaganda nor the often
careless recruiting speeches of poli-
ticians must blind our eyes to the fact
that men of great nobility have opted
for the Communist “solution” as a
result of French colonialism and this
book includes a moving letter by a
Vietnamese intellectual as to why this
was happening in the 19305. But there
were men of great nobility who for
years served the Nazi armies and the
Nazi State. So what?
The revolutionary war is being
opposed because the objectives being
served by the men of nobility are not
the real objectives; the war is being
fought about the totalitarian enslave-
ment of a peasantry whose soldiers,
those who belong to the Viet Cong, are
the victims of a huge confidence trick.
“Liberation War” today leads only to
political subjugation; indeed that kind
of war is simply yet another means
used to bring about the subjugation of
the people by the Communist Party.
Nevertheless it is both humanly and
politically desirable that we should
know the kind of conditions in which
men like Ho Chi Minh and Vo
Nguyen Giap grew up. The late Ngo
Dinh Diem’s brother was murdered by
the Communists, yes; but Giap’s wife,
a very young woman, died in a French
prison and he lost his child as well.
And so Giap says, “So many people die
every day, anyway; what difference
does the sacrifice of thousands in war
matter?”
T errible things have happened in
Vietnam; they must not be allowed to
be obscured by the smoke of the rump-
fed “Lanyon” barbecue and similar
velleities. After all, there is no comfort
in this book for the political nihilists.
Malraux described them many years
ago in the character of Ch’en, the
onanistic terrorist: “He no longer be-
longed to China ... a complete liberty
gave him over completely to his mind
. . . The only thing which his present
state of mind did not transform into
nothingness was the idea of creating
those doomed Executioners, that race
of avengers.” The political nihilists see
in the Viet Cong avengers of their own
hurts here at home; executioners of the
society they blame for all their un-
happiness. But the Viet Cong are men.
Malraux salutarily reminds us of this
fact.
Kenneth Slessor’s Vision
By THOMAS W. SHAPCOTT
Kenneth Slessor. Clement Semmler.
British Council Writers and their
Work Series. 194. Longmans. $0.85.
Kenneth slessor is the first
Australian poet to be honored by
a monograph in the British Coun-
cil “Writers and their Work” series of
booklets, the only other Australian rep-
resented to date being predictably
—• Patrick White.
Slessor is probably a good first intro-
duction to modern Australian verse for
an overseas reader and one presumes
this booklet will have a wider distribu-
tion in England than in Australia
for, as Clement Semmler states, “he
has worn well.” And also, as Mr. Semm-
ler continues, “his verse presents a tidy
front: one collection covers his whole
output.” (No necessity for provisos or
qualifications to forestall future develop-
ments. ) Slessor, then, seems a good
basic choice for such a series. Certainly,
as far as our own attitudes are con-
cerned, he is required reading for any-
one who would understand the hows
and the whys of our poetry since it first
shook off the uniform of colonialism at
its most grotesque in the late 1920 s and
early 19305.
The plan of Mr. Semmler’s mono-
graph makes it clear that he is essaying
a work of introduction, not of analy-
sis in depth. He is, for instance, at

pains to give a thumbnail sketch of the
literary climate Slessor grew to maturity
in. Actually, I found the opening para-
graph of the introduction rather mis-
leading, and certainly for overseas
readers quite erroneous expectations
might be drawn from this comment:
Kenneth Slessor was born in 1901
in the town of Orange in New South
Wales. Nearby was the birthplace of
A. B. “Banjo” Paterson, the most
famous of Australian bush balladists,
thirty-seven years earlier; in this dis-
trict, too, some of the richest strikes
took place during the gold rushes
of the last century. These coinci-
dences of Slessor’s birthplace are not
unrelated to his place in Australian
poetry.
The tone of such an opening would
surely lead the reader to expect evidence
of some genuine inheritance in Slessor’s
work of the bush ballad tradition, or
some deep poetic assimilation of either
gold or discovery. Needless to say, Mr.
Semmler advances neither theory, this
is just a device to present certain, most
general, background data. (In point of
fact, Slessor’s one poem on a bush-
ranger theme is not referred to in the
text.) I mention this opening para-
graph because, although it is not a
major flaw in an otherwise acceptable
and useful “introduction,” it does indi-
cate a certain lack of precision, of fully
thought-out reasoning which, if added
to the occasional clumsiness in the writ-
ing (as in the second introductory
paragraph), does detract from any final
sense of authoritativeness.
There are two striking instances, in
the body of the text, of a similar failure
to acknowledge other than the surface
implications of a statement. In both
cases Mr. Semmler is content merely
to brush the problem aside as being no
“problem” at all.
The first is raised thus:
Why Slessor, a city-based, land-
lubber, should have projected with
his poetry his magnificent visions and
concepts of the sea is a question
which has brought forward all
manner of critical theories. It was,
so it has been said, “his first image
of permanence.” With his discovery
of the sea “he became a poet not of
frenzy but of calm; not of escapism
but of exploration ... It drew him
because of its separateness from
human business . . .” (Charles
Higham in “The Poetry of Kenneth
Slessor,” Quadrant Summer, 1959-
60.)
“I doubt it,” concludes Mr. Semmler.
“It must surely be simpler than that.”
And so he goes on to prove that it was
because Slessor “lived during what
were creatively his most fecund years
in an eyrie overlooking Sydney
Harbor” that the sea naturally pre-
sented itself as a source-material, as
it were:
Slessor’s preoccupation with the
sea then is simply the concomitant
of his lifelong association with the
Harbor.
Well, in a sense this may be so,
though there are numerous other
Sydney poets who have lived within
sight and smell of the Harbor for
extended periods but have not made of
it a whole poetically generative con-
cept. What about Rosemary Dobson,
as one instance, who lived for years
in Neutral Bay, but whose references to
the Harbor or the sea could be counted
on one hand? No, the point made by
Charles Higham in the article quoted
by Mr. Semmler for deprecation is
infinitely more responsive to the actual
creative sources of the ocean for
Slessor the poet than is Mr. Semmler’s
interesting but limited and surely
superficial illustrations of the poet’s
harbor vision as being that of a man
“looking through glass.”
Mr. Semmler lightly dismisses as
irrelevant, also, the “so-called riddle
of Slessor’s abrupt decision 20 years
ago not to go on writing poetry” by
blandly asserting that “his unusual
capacity for self-criticism” was the
“quality which is quite simply the
answer” to the question.
Once again, in a sense, this may be
so, but only in the most limited and
least meaningful sense. The question
of Slessor’s termination of activity as a
poet has surely roots in a problem
more deep than that of simple and
rigid self-criticism.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Ore, not Offices
AUSTRALIAN financial institutions, which in past years
had given the impression they thought the word
“development” meant putting up a city office block,
now appear to be making the biggest plunge into develop-
ing Australian natural resources in their history. It seems
likely that some announcement could be made before
Christmas on the $9O million or so in borrowings soon to
be needed by the local members of the Mount Newman
iron ore consortium, CSR and BHP.
Certainly there have been a few other examples of
developmental initiative by the institutions, such as the
AMP’s efforts in South Australian land reclamation, its
pastoral interests, the mixed bag of institutional investors
in the Gove bauxite consortium (it must soon be time we
heard something about this), and recently the Savage River
iron ore financing. But nothing on the scale of the Mount
Newman project, which will cost about $240 million, had
ever been done. This could mark . a turning point. The
search for and exploitation of mineral deposits in Australia
has been one of the major developments of the past five
years; yet it has been left largely to foreign-financed com-
panies to carry the burden and to reap the .rewards. And
even now, the institutions are playing no pact' in the
search for oil and natural gas, or phosphate rock, or any
of the minerals that make up such a large proportion of
our export income.
It would be appropriate if the new, more adventurous
appearance these institutions have taken on, now that they
are prepared to put up money for developing iron ore
deposits, could also spread to the search for oil and the
other natural resources on which this country’s future
depends to a far greater extent than on the number of
office blocks built in Sydney and Melbourne.
There are other positive steps going on in Western Aus-
tralia to settle the confused state of the iron ore situation,
in addition to this vital question of raising local money for
Mount Newman. Allis Chalmers, who are building BHP’s
Whyalla pellet plant, and Dravo, construction group for
the first of Hamersley Iron’s Dampier plants, have been in-
vited to tender by March for the Cliffs pellet plant. This
is the first definite forward move announced from this com-
pany since they broke with BHP on shared plant and port
facilities at Cape Preston, near the Robe River mouth. And
it came as the company’s president, William E. Dohnal,
vice-president of the parent Cleveland Cliffs Company,
started talks last week in Tokyo aimed at getting an exten-
sion on the time the Japanese steel-makers have allowed
Cliffs to show how they will mine, process, and ship out
the 71.4 million tons of pellets they have contracted to sell.
The tender goes out before tests have been completed
on the West Australian ore at a $2 million trial plant set
up in Michigan. Garrick Agnew, spokesman for the Aus-
tralian participants, explains: “Even though the pilot plant
tests that have been running continuously since September
will not be completed until next month, their success to date
is sufficient base to call tenders. Any refinement determined
before completion can be written in at a later stage. The
unusual step of calling tenders before completion of pellet
plant trials has been taken to allay fears in Japan that time
is against the group. ...”
It was no coincidence, either, that Hamersley leaked in-
formation at the same time last week about their plans to-
build a second pellet plant at Dampier—rather than Japan,
as was hinted several weeks ago. This will be a $5O million
MEN AND MATTERS
BUSINESSMEN who had been tak-
ing a close interest in the de-
velopment of the Department of
Marketing at the University of N.S.W.
were not at all surprised by the news
that the first Professor of Marketing,
Professor J. B. Schneider, is to leave
the job at the end of his preliminary
two-year appointment next February
and return to California.
Professor Schneider, who left his job
as head of the Marketing Department
of the San Francisco State College, had
become involved in some basic disa-
greements over the proposed content
of the courses that are scheduled to
begin to the department’s first under-
graduates next March.
The department was mainly financed
by contributions from the business
community, and originally aimed at
presenting a complete marketing
course. But some businessmen say that
the courses now planned fall far short
of those envisaged when they were
asked to contribute large sums to
create the chair. It also appears
likely that the “personality clashes” to
which Professor Schneider referred
when announcing his return to Cali-
fornia involved a clear break with the
head of the School of Business Admin-
istration at the University, Professor
Neville Wills.
The new man in the chair, 32-year-
old Roger Layton** senior lecturer in
Economic Statis-
tics at the Uni-
versity for the
last six years, is
described by the
Unive rsi t y as
“widely travelled
and widely ex-
perienced in mar-
keting,” having
been active as a
consultant to a
number of Aus-
tralian companies,
mainly in market-
ing and marketing research.
But his background is nevertheless
largely academic. He wrote his Master
of Economics thesis, “Stochastic Linear
Programming,” while an operations re-
search officer at BHP (where Professor
Wills was at that time employed) and
joined the University of N.S.W. in
1958.
NOBODY is more in the thick of
the financial fray in Melbourne
than 53-year-old Mr. C. T.
Looker, who succeeds Mr. A. B. Mellor
as chairman of the Stock Exchange of
Melbourne after the latter’s six tireless
and fruitful years, three as chairman
of the Australian Associated Stock
Exchanges, in the job.
It is unusual not to have a senior
partner of a member firm as chairman,
Roger Layton
Prof. J. B. Schneider
C. T. Looker
but Mr. Looker’s high standing in the
Establishment and his apprenticeship
this last year as the first vice-chairman
of the Exchange warrant the exception.
Presumably, he will take over from Sir
lan Potter, who is 64, at lan Potter
and Co. in the not too distant future.
Mr. Looker was born in Hobart but,
like Sir lan, has strong Sydney con-
nections, being educated at Fort Street
and the University of Sydney before
spells at the PM’s Department in Can-
berra (he was private secretary to
Menzies when PM, 1939-41) and in
the RANVR.
Strongly disclaiming that any con-
flict of interest arises from a broker
also being a director of public com-
panies, Mr. Looker’s directorships
number inter alia, Australian United
Corporation, South Cross Proper-
ties, and A. V. Jennings.


plant and the news comes at the same time as an offer,
to be answered by December 31, to supply 30 million added
tons of pellets over 16 years from 1970, as well as an
increased amount of lump ore.
But for all the positive aspects of the West Australian
iron ore scene, a number of problems and questions remain.
It has been reported, without denial, that sanction for a
contract for the export of Hamersley iron ore has been
refused by the Federal Government; the reason for not
announcing the patently obvious participation of the Daniel
K. Ludwig company, Sentinel Mining, in the area before
the Western Australian Parliament rose is hard to understand;
and all the bugs are not yet finally out of the Mount New-
man arrangement.
Hopes for Wittenoom
CLOSURE at the end of this month of Australia’s only
blue-asbestos mine, at Wittenoom Gorge, may prove
in the long run to be one of the best things that has
happened in the area. The West Australian Government
now intends to encourage other interests to move into the
area and has quickly squashed rumors of its own plans to
take over operations. Some townspeople actually wanted
world-wide tenders for the leases. Many of the others in
the town will certainly get better work at far better wages
on other north-western mining projects. Employers from the
W.A. Chamber of Mines offered experienced miners \york
on the goldfields; officers from iron ore companies, even from
Cobar, converged on the town as the announcement was
made.
Australian Blue Asbestos, a subsidiary of Colonial Sugar
Refining, established the town 19 years ago, amid hopes
that today seem ridiculous; this was to become an area
that would supersede the goldfields in importance. Now
the problem will be to stop Wittenoom becoming another
mining ghost-town, although the tourist potential is out-
standing and comparatively untapped.
Since setting up, CSR have produced $3l million worth
of blue asbestos, exporting two-thirds of this. They have
paid only one dividend from this venture, and their accumu-
lated losses over the 23 years have amounted to $2.5 million
—so the writing has been on the wall and rumors of a
close-down have been circulating for years, although the
-capital-hungry Mount Newman iron ore venture was prob-
ably the straw that broke the camel’s back. There is no
blue asbestos in the dollar area and America’s needs (the
blue is stronger than the white and is used for reinforcing)
must be imported either from Africa or from Australia.
The ore itself is a peculiar blue-black sodium-iron com-
pound, like a layer of vertically packed silk thread two
or three inches deep within horizontal strata of rock. It
is hell to mine; the miners have to stoop low to get their
drills at the face and then risk asbestosis, a particularly
grisly type of lung irritation, which is often fatal.
Despite the long record of company losses, the shock
to the Government is seen by the recent improvements
in the town and the amount of money spent there—a $300,000
hospital opened in May, a new $152,000 police station, the
$687,000 of debts owing the State Housing Commission, and
the $225,000 Treasury injection over the past three years
to help the company’s diamond drilling program. Some of
this might be salvaged if Wittenoom becomes the kind of
tourist town many believe possible, but a more likely alterna-
tive would be to have a bigger concern than CSR move in
and step up the efficiency and throughput, and, perhaps
more important, to scale up the shipping rates to take
advantage of bulk-cargo charges.
Mr. Lang Hancock, who started the mine in the area
he discovered as a boy (and who later started the iron
ore boom with his discovery of the vast Pilbara iron ore-
bodies), is bitterly disappointed with CSR’s decision to
move out, just as the townspeople are. But with his partner
Mr. E. A. Wright, Mr. Hancock holds leases over adjacent
areas and would back a scheme getting going on a bigger
scale, as he believes it could. “They have been mining
the plums out of it and no ore body can stand that,” he
says. “I am convinced the closure of Wittenoom will only
be temporary.”
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: November’s exports, at
$259. lm., yielded a favorable current balance of sB.Bm.
over imports at $250.3m. —the third month of 1966-67
to move this way; nevertheless, the five months to
November display a $45.3m. trading deficit. Invisibles,
of course, throw the overseas trading account into, much
heavier deficit.
The Federal Government is completing negotiation
of a Euro-dollar loan totalling $U.5.25m., currency 10
years and interest rate 6£ percent.
New South Wales’ current wheat harvest is estimated
to reach a record 165 m. bushels—l3.sm. bushels better
than the previous, 1964-65, peak.
For the markets: Most of last week cer-
tainly showed a livelier and more sustained demand for
large areas of industrials, including leaders, on Aus-
tralian share markets. Yet some of the pressure weak-
ened toward the close, leaving minerals and oils still
with the strength.
A brave front on Rhodesia could not be held in
London, which also had to stomach the Bank of Eng-
land’s warning on external payments; industrials, and
bonds drifted back ... Wall Street became very mixed
on end-of-week profit-taking after four days of mild
advance.
For companies: Development Finance Cor-
poration’s chairman, Mr. J. H. D. Marks, argues for
establishment of a central (official) secretariat “to
supervise both the marketing of securities and the
operation of the Australian capital market” . . . The
N.S.W. Government breaks off negotiations with builder
and contractor James Wallace, winner of the Rocks
(Sydney) redevelopment tender; Wallace is “going to
fight like hell to get it back” . . . Patience triumphs
for Australian Oil and Gas Corporation, which pays
Australia’s first oil production dividend, 4 cents a share,
and sees Moonie productive until 1982.
Oil took more optimism from West Australian Petro-
leum (Wapet), whose Barrow Island fields possess
estimated recoverable reserves (by primary methods)
of 114 m. barrels—up 34 percent on earlier estimates
. . . A tin miner was not so fortunate: Loloma is to
cease its Stannary Hills (North Queensland) operations
early in 1967 because of bad grades . . . Despondent
about gold, Great Boulder plans to search for nickel
at Hampton Plains, near Kalgoorlie . . . Greenbushes
Tin is now profitable.
Paint maker Taubmans, helped from N.Z. activities,
earned $976,301 (up from $969,940) and held a 16
percent dividend . . . Sales went up 20.8 perfcent to
$270.6m. for ICIANZ, but earnings only added 2.2 per-
cent to touch $9.4m.
The initial debenture issue from FNCB-Waltons Cor-
poration asks for s3m., with possible oversubscription
ssm., and significantly lowers most rates compared with
a March issue by Waltons Credit ... Sales’ by Cox
Brothers (receiver and manager appointed) went down
from $42.43m. to $40.76m. in the 1965-66 year . . .
H. G. Palmer (Consolidated) has won a sales tax
refund of $2,778,234; the receiver now has an sB.sm.
surplus for an early distribution.
Much-battered Concrete Industries, facing a board
struggle, has written more than s2m. off its 51 percent
interest in the Hurstville Super Centre; its claims on
the North West Cape project may be resolved by about
mid-1967—losses here could be as high as s6m. . . .
Boral’s Melbourne quarry acquisition, Bayview, suffered
auditors’ qualification of its accounts; according to Boral
these resulted from a change in accounting practices
after takeover.
Brisbane and Adelaide Stock Exchanges are urging a
return to a sliding-scale method of brokerage charges,
strenuously opposed by flat-rate proponents Sydney and
Melbourne.

A Serve of the Savoy Grill
By CROESUS
ULTIMATELY we will be getting
a full meal served by investigators
at the Savoy Grill, during which
a number of missing details about the
marriage of Mr. J. R. Hall’s private in-
terests with the one-time thriving and
listed Savoy Corporation Ltd. should
be revealed. For the moment, we have
to be content with more hors d’oeuvres
from Messrs. J. G. Whelan and M. J. L.
Dowling, QC, who offer reports on
four of the ten Hall concerns declared
by the Victorian Attorney-General
about this time last year. They /are
enough to be going on with, and it can
be said straight away that, compared
with some recently delivered by Vic-
torian QCs, their rebukes of yet an-
other dominating director of a public
company to have lost a heap of in-
vestors’ money are mild,
The four reports only get us to the
outskirts of the ill-fated Savoy Cor-
poration itself (an application for
liquidation is pending), in which, it
will be recalled, Mr. Hall bbught a con-
trolling interest from the Whelan
family (no relation to the investigator)
for 55 cents a 50 cent share for half
(or more) of the 1,646,476 shares at the
end of 1963 and proceeded to change
its character from a hotel and real
estate developer along housing and con-
struction lines. The only one of the
four concerns now reported on bearing
the Savoy name is Savoy Management
Pty. Ltd. The other three are Menzies
Estates Pty. Ltd., Second United Per-
manent Building Society, and Cathedral
Valley Softwoods Co-operative Ltd.
(The six declared companies still to be
reported on are Savoy Corporation Ltd.,
Rogerson Hall Consolidated Pty. Ltd.,
Finance Corporation Ltd., Section
Homes Pty. Ltd., David Johns & Co.
Pty. Ltd., and Property Securities Pty.
Ltd.)
The reason the current four reports
have been grouped is, presumably, that
they all bear mainly on the affairs of
the Cathedral Valley Co-operative,
which was formed in April, 1963, as a
co-operative trading society for a
forestry venture at Taggerty in the
Eildon Weir country, about 65 miles
north of Melbourne. This, of course,
was eight months before Mr. Hall took
over Savoy Corporation.
The investigations reveal some money
traffic between one of the four com-
panies (the building society) and Savoy
Corporation but not from Savoy to any
of them. So, pro-tem, consideration of
the possibility of Savoy’s losses being
partly incurred in Mr. Hall’s Cathedral
Valley forestry venture must be re-
served. So far as the involvement of
public money is concerned there were,
however, two clear routes through which
it was siphoned into the scheme. These
were the co-operative itself and the
building society.
EQUALLY, the investigators mark
channels through which funds
flowed into Hall family companies, such
as Menzies Estates (from whom the Co-
operative’s land was bought in a partly
developed state) and into U.S. Finance
Corporation (to which, for instance,
the building society at one time ad-
vanced “a large amount,” as it also
did to Savoy Corporation).
Although they raise a lot of ques-
tions about them, the investigators stop
short of saying there was anything
improper in thq financial relations with
the family companies. They were
certainly vastly complicated and their
documentation sketchy. It seems it was
this, more than anything else strongly-
felt by them, which prompted Mr.
Dowling to make the following obser-
vation in relation to Menzies Estates:
“It appears that there has been a
breach by Mr. Hall of the provisions
of Section 161 (1) of the Companies
Act 1961 relating to accounts and other
records of the company. It appears
that such accounting and other records
as would sufficiently explain the trans-
actions and financial position of the
company were not kept in the manner
contemplated by the sub-section. This
stricture applies also to Mrs. Elsie
Hall and to Mrs. Mona Lydia Hall;
but perhaps their culpability may not
appear to be as great. Although the
section I haye mentioned is sometimes
considered to be of importance only
where public companies are concerned,

ND.2O.N.
it will be seen that where a private
company’s affairs become intimately
connected with the affairs of a public
company, as in the present case, it
becomes eminently desirable that proper
records be maintained to enable an
appropriate examination and assess-
ment to be made of the company’s
financial position and activities gener-
ally, should the need arise. If such
records are not kept in this kind of
company I suggest that this becomes
reprehensible. In the same fashion I
consider that it may well be the case
that there has been a breach or that
there have been breaches of the pro-
visions of Section 303 of the Companies
Act 1961 in that proper books of
account were not kept by the company
throughout the period of two years
immediately preceding the commence-
ment of my investigations.”
While the revelations in these four
reports should certainly spur the AGs
on in their efforts to get fuller dis-
closure of the affairs of private com-
panies, they will also prompt them to
look hard at some of the regulations
governing co-operatives and building
societies, the two main channels used
to bring public money into the
Cathedral Valley venture.
JJAVING gone to such lengths to
prove that the brochure “The
Harvest of the Forest,” used to advertise
the investment merits of the Cathedral
Valley scheme, hardly measured up to a
legitimately accurate prospectus which
hawkers of shares in the Co-operative
could stump the country with, it is
surprising to me that the investigator
didn’t recommend that such literature
should be examined and passed by the
Registrar of Co-operatives.
In fact, the investigator’s recommen-
dations for the future of the Co-
operative look most ineffectual consider-
ing his finding that, although there’s
a fair chance of investors in it ulti-
mately getting their money back, “it
is most unlikely that they will recover
any other amount except perhaps a few
pounds before 25 years at the earliest
and more probably before 30 years or a
period in excess of that even then
it is highly improbable that investors
will recover overall any return on
capital beyond a very small rate of
interest.” He says, in effect, that while
the constitution of an independent board
could be the answer, “Mr. Hall’s own
considerable abilities as a salesman,
negotiator, and advocate must militate
against any opposition to the present
board and its policies.”
Mr. Dowling was rather more posi-
tive in his recommendations for the
building society, saying that it cannot
pay its debts and should be wound up
in the interests of its shareholders and
creditors. Although the Registrar of
Building Societies periodically expressed
“considerable disquiet” at its conduct,
apparently this was not strong enough
to stop it in its tracks. In the result
Mr. Dowling had to take a very hard
line indeed.

By JASON
THERE are two main advantages in
buying 50-cent shares between 15
and 20 cents below their par
value: one is that a small rise in money
terms means a big rise proportionately
(and the brokerage is low), and the
other is that if everything goes wrong
you won’t lose too much!
At present two such companies
L. J. Hooker Investment Corporation
with its shares at 34 cents and Concrete
Industries (Monier) Ltd. with its shares
at 31 cents —are very much in the pub-
lic eye. Both have considerable appeal
at these prices despite the evident risks,
and a holding of both could act as
some sort of spreading of these risks.
Last week’s balance sheet from the
L. J. Hooker group was significant in
that it settled two major problems
worrying shareholders. In the first
place, the company is cheapening its
interest costs in refinancing the bulk of
its fixed-interest loans (largely from the
U.S.), so that, out of its total borrow-
ings of $32.3 million, about $25 million
is now on this “satisfactory” basis.
Although its borrowings rose by about
$2 million during the year, its interest
bill fell by $133,000 to $2.3 million,
being a major factor in the company
holding its net profit up at $765,000
despite the disaster in its drought-
affected pastoral division.
The other main contributor to profit
was the $560,000 rise in income from
investments to $BBO,OOO, mainly from
its 40 percent interest in the T. M.
Burke group, the Victorian developer,
which is expected to contribute a high
dividend again in the current year.
Without these two, the company’s
profit would have looked much sicker,
as the pastoral losses would otherwise
have chopped the previous year’s
modest profit of $806,000 to barely
$lOO,OOO. As it is, the pastoral losses
completely wiped out any profits from
the rest of the organisation and took
$235,000 of investment income with
them.
The second point is that the pastoral
division, which appears to have lost
about $3 million last year, is clearly
the vital sector, being far more impor-
tant than the office building and home-
tinit projects which some may feel have
now become highly speculative.
The company’s plans for disposal of
sections of the pastoral division do not
now appear to extend to its cattle
interests in Northern Australia, which
make up about 9800 square miles and
on which the company has spent about
$2 million on improvements. This
section of the division has excellent
prospects and was not hit as badly by
the drought as the sheep properties in
N.S.W. In any event its U.S. meat
exports return more dollars than the
company must meet in interest pay-
ments on its U.S. loans, so providing
an excellent hedge against devaluation.
If the pastoral division simply stop-
ped losing, the Hooker earning rate
would be up around the 30 percent
mark —not counting as capital the 3
million Buckland options that are exer-
cisable at par by the end of 1970,
and not providing for normal tax. If
enough of the pastoral division can be
sold, big profits for the group should
not be too many years off.
Despite the complaints of two rivals
for the Concrete Industries board, and
the inevitability that the company must
suffer losses of some magnitude from
either its NW Cape or its Hurstville
Super Centre activities (or, more likely,
from both), the importance of getting
these two factors in perspective can be
seen from the fact that the $3.2 million
investment in Hurstville is only 5 per-
cent of the group’s assets, and that
the company has provided a $5.8 mil-
lion contingency provision mainly
against NW Cape losses (which it con-
siders could total $6 million at the
most).
INVESTORS who are not clients
of the Melbourne broker now hand-
ling a small off-market placement
in Australian Controls at a modest
discount could nevertheless find the
stock well worth considering. Although
the shares are now at their year’s peak
around $1.95, to yield less than four
percent on dividends (but 11 percent
on earnings), there is no suggestion
that anybody propped this market up
for any placement, and prices could
well move well over the $2 mark in
the new year.
This company’s business is expand-
ing so rapidly (with debtors and stock
both well up in the latest year) that
further capital raisings seem likely
sooner or later.
As the nation’s major manufacturer
of thermostatic controls for the domes-
tic appliance industry, its traditional
markets are limited, although highly
profitable, and the surplus cash it has
been stacking away for the past few
years (the 1965-66 15 percent dividend
was covered nearly three times by pro-
fit) has led directors to state quite
openly that they are seeking diver-

sification routes which will add both
strength and security to the group.
So far, the expertise which they have
displayed since 1959, when operations
were reorganised and earning rate be-
gan its rise from that year’s paltry
5 percent, is reflecting itself in their
diversification moves.
Acquisitions have been the major
pipeline merchant in Australia, H. and
H. J. Wagg Pty. Ltd., and furniture
maker Fler. The first will enable the
group to provide a complete pipe,
valves, and fittings service to the oil,
petrochemical, chemical, and water
supply industries. Probably more im-
portant, from a growth point of view,
is the foothold gained in any develop-
ment staged by the natural gas indus-
try.
The Fler takeover left financial ob-
servers perplexed for a while. But
the facts are now starting to filter
through and they look good. Fler’s
management was among the best in
the Australian furniture industry; it
has been retained. The company had
a good name and could have easily
expanded had it not been for the lack
of cash; Australian Controls has pro-
vided this. After takeover, there was
some reorganisation, mainly the estab-
lishment of a Tasmanian factory
which will cut distribution costs through
cheap bulk sea transport to mainland
markets. In addition, timber is more
readily available there and power costs
are lower.
The group as a whole has budgeted
for record profits this year, so earning
rate could well rise above 50 percent.
At this high level, it seems incon-
ceivable that shareholders should get
anything less than another dividend
lift or at least a new issue with a
large bonus element. Any marked
development in demand for the scrip
should provide a decent rise on the
market, as 40 percent of the capital
is unattainable—it is held by Ranco
of the U.S. Management is sufficiently
skilled to increase sales by a third in
1965-66 (despite the ailings of the
appliance industry), and with two
brokers on the board it is conscious of
the group’s market image, so tangible
benefits seem likely in the future.
THOSE considering buying Cleve-
land Tin shares could delay their
decision for a while yet. A large
Sydney broking house has a huge parcel
of them which it is offering to clients
at 34 cents. Chances are that a fair
percentage of the clients who take up
the offer will be doing so in the hope
of selling them again as soon as pos-
sible at a profit on the market.
It is believed that the parcel held by
the broker came from Metals Explora-
tion. Originally, this company was en-
titled to about 2.3 million Cleveland
shares and, presumably, the broker is
trying to allot them all. This means a
considerable degree of selling pressure
could be brought to bear on the mar-
ket over the next few weeks. The shares
were at 40 cents when the broker
offered the parcel to clients and have
since drifted lower.
As a result, many speculators who
have taken them up at 34 cents could
find themselves with little or no profit.
With the expected selling pressure from
their associates and the prospect of calls
next year, investors seeking a genuine
investment may be able to effect cheaper
entry than they can at present.
LAST week’s annual meeting of
Glazebrooks Paints and Chemi-
cals in Melbourne added strongly
to the disenchantment which the mar-
ket is feeling over the group’s Sydney-
based parent, Clyde Industries. At the
meeting it was revealed that Clyde is
“financing” some of the ailing Glaze-
brooks’ operations. Mr; R. E. Purves,
the chairman, was, not very specific on
the matter, although he did say that
Clyde had provided the cash necessary
to redeem the Glazebrooks’ notes which
The Chartist says:
GOLD MINES OF KALGOORLIE (AUST. ) LIMITED is a stock worthy of
investors’ attention at current levels, about $1.15. The share price movements
over the past six years have been somewhat cyclical and a 30 percent uptrend
has been followed since the low point of 75c recorded in 1965 and a high point of
$1.31, which was achieved in June of this year on heavy volume. The consolidated
pattern to date suggests a further rise to approximately $1.60 and possibly higher.
Allowance should be made for a 2.5c tax-free dividend, as the stock will be called
ex dividend on 7/12/66. The situation would call for assessment should sales fall
below $1.02 in the short term, which would break the present uptrend. Last sale
price on 9/12/66 : —$1.17.

matured on November 30. The money
had been loaned to Glazebrooks free
of interest.
As the paint company is not the
only Clyde subsidiary doing badly
(Regent Motors, of Melbourne, is an-
other it is selling off some of its
yards), shareholders can hope that dir-
ectors do not have any bigger headaches
than that provided by Glazebrooks,
which has not made a decent profit for
years now; its position in the industry
is getting worse instead of better. Share-
holders’ capital will be down to one
half of its original $2-million-odd if
another loss is incurred in the current
year, and that seems almost inevitable.
The vital point shareholders will need
to know is what advantages the Clyde
group is getting by putting all this
money Glazebrooks’ way—at some risk.
Recent company history suggests that
if someone cannot afford to pay in-
terest, then their chances of paying back
the principal are not too good.
Despite all this, the Clyde group is
strong financially, although it appears
to be in a period of stagnation and the
15 percent dividend seems high unless
the 18.4 percent earning rate can be
improved on. And, in any event, Glaze-
brooks is not an integral or significant
member of the group. But Clyde share-
holders would want to be certain that
there are no other soft spots that could
turn nasty.
BUYING on the rebound has always
been an interesting exercise, and
often profitable. The greeting card
crowd, Valentine Holdings, is currently
in this position. It is barely a year
since they were listed. The 50-cent
shares made their debut at around 95
cents and an excellent 1965-66 year
peaked them at more than $1.30 a
couple of months ago. Since then,
market reaction has taken them back
to almost $l, but they have started their
rebound and are now buyable at $l.lO.
The 1965-66 dividend of 12| percent
exceeded the prospectus forecast by
2% percent and was covered more than
twice by the profit. Sales were higher
in the first quarter of the current year.
Directors are gradually turning what
was a relatively makeshift marketing
system into something more perman-
ent and more profitable. A New Zealand
subsidiary has been formed to handle
the Norcross range. A new office and
warehouse is being built in Perth.
Extra freehold and factory buildings
have been bought at Clayton (Vic.),
adjoining the existing plant.
The industry has been growing, is
growing, and looks like continuing to do
so for some time. The franchise from
Norcross of the U.S. runs until 1975
and will most likely be renewed. The
well-covered dividend, growth prospects,
and the attractive dividend yield of 5£
percent put the shares into the “good
short to medium term buy” bracket.

Another Gold Fields Issue?
ONE of the reasons for the stock-
market’s enthusiastic welcome for
Consolidated Gold Fields this
week is that there is a distinct prospect
the shares are cum a new issue in the
not-too-distant future.
In January, 1963, Sir George Harvie-
Watt, chairman of Consolidated Gold
Fields of South Africa, first announced
that his company intended to make an
issue of shares available to Australian
investors. At that time he indicated that
the issue would probably be made when
the group’s iron ore venture (at Mt.
Goldsworthy in Western Australia, one-
third owned) became productive. In
April, 1965, he reiterated this, indicating
that the public issue would take place
probably within 12 months.
Following the first shipment of iron
ore from Mt. Goldsworthy in June of
this year, the issue has now been made
and its terms are history. Local investors
were offered a 22.7 percent interest in
the Australian operations of the Gold
Fields group. Without taking the
“probabilities” indicated by the chair-
man as firm statements of intention,
the large difference between the ex-
pected 35-40 percent local interest and
the 22.7 percent actually issued never-
theless raises some interesting possibili-
ties.
JTOR example, in December, 1964, Sir
George indicated that the partners in
the Mt. Goldsworthy Mining Associates
joint venture (Gold Fields, Cyprus
Mines Corporation, of Los Angeles, and
Utah Construction and Mining Com-
pany, of San Francisco) intended to
offer the Australian public an interest
in this venture of about 20 percent.
The amount mentioned in the recent
prospectus as the final cost of this joint
venture was $52 million, of which all
but $6 million of sums spent to date
has been raised by way of advances
from the three partners.
Profitability of this iron ore venture
is likely to be quite sufficient to convert
a large part of these loan funds into
equity capital, and an offer to the
public of the mooted 20 percent would
have the effect of increasing local par-
ticipation in the Australian operations
of the Gold Fields group. If made at
all, such an issue would, no doubt, be
at a premium. The first of the iron
ore share issues so far offered to the
local public was made at a 50 percent
premium. This was the 25 percent
interest in North West Iron Company
Limited offered to Australian institu-
tions, in which Kathleen Investments
(Aust.) Limited participated. North
West Iron Company Limited, jointly
with the Dahlia Mining Company
Limited (representing Japanese inter-
ests), is developing iron ore deposits
at the Savage River in north-western
Tasmania.
Whether or not other iron ore projects
(Hamersley, Mt. Newman, Mt. Golds-
worthy) make a public issue of shares
available, local investors will still have
a stake in them through, the develop-
ment companies concerned Conzinc
Riotinto of Australia Limited, BHP,
and CSR, and Gold Fields itself
through the recent issue. The chairman
of CRA, Sir Maurice Mawby, has, of
course, already said that his company
intends to make available to the public
an issue of shares in the Hamersley
iron ore project. CRA has just made
a three-for-ten bonus issue. This bonus
has been made two years almost to the
day after the three-for-ten bonus made
in December, 1964. That bonus was a
prelude to an issue to shareholders the
following April, when a rights issue
on a two-for-five basis was made at a
premium of $2.90 per share. No doubt
a further premium issue is to be ex-
pected, with the possibility that it could
take the form of an issue of shares in
Hamersley Iron.
This is the more likely manner by
which the local equity in Gold Fields
will be increased. Local shareholders
will, no doubt, be offered further shares
by way of cash issues in which the
United Kingdom parent company will
pass on part x>r all of its entitlement
to the local shareholders, as occurred
when Conzinc Riotinto of Australia
made its first “rights” issue to share-
holders in March, 1965. At the time
of that issue the local equity in CRA
was ten percent, but most of the en-
titlement of the English parent, Rio
Tinto Zinc Corporation, was added
to local shareholders’ entitlements and
the issue had the effect of increasing
the local equity to 15 percent. Is such
an issue by Gold Fields likely to occur
within the next two or three years?
The issue just made raised sl2£ mil-
lion, from which expenses took
$425,000, leaving $12,075,000. From this
the company repaid loan funds of $1.3
million to the United Kingdom parent,
and since June has spent $1.3 million on
the iron ore venture as well as agreeing
to lend Renison Limited $1.5 million.
This leaves a balance of just under $8
million, out of which the company is to
spend $300,000 on exploration in 1967.

For a company of Gold Fields’ size and
nature, $7,700,000 is not a very great
deal of money to spend on “following
up its interests” and “strengthening its
resources,” as the prospectus puts it
capital expenditure over the past three
years has been at the rate of $lO million
per year.
Items likely to absorb sizable
amounts of money include the comple-
tion of Bellambi Coal’s expansion pro-
\gram, a third dredge for Wyong
Minerals, and the ultimate development
of the very large low-grade copper ore
body at Mt. Lyell, if this should prove
to be commercially feasible. Should the
company venture outside its existing
interests, the funds required would be
substantial; a 50 percent or more inter-
est in any of the more promising listed
mining companies would not come
cheaply in today’s market. With ex-
ploration and development in the
mining industry being maintained at
its current high level, there is a distinct
possibility that Gold Fields’ next call
on Australian investors may not be too
far away.
COMMODITIES
Bullish View
On Silver
SPECULATION on a silver price rise
has calmed, but the heavy forward
purchases made in recent months
still hang over the market as a sign that
the bulls are in control. Some European
holdings have been liquidated recently,
however, partly because of the better
outlook for sterling, for which silver is
almost as good a hedge as gold.
The total of contracts outstanding
on the New York Commodity Exchange
has held steady recently, at about 22
million ounces. The open speculative
positions in Europe probably total some-
what more than this, it is believed.
The absence of liquidations in the
U.S. reflects the generally more bullish
attitude on silver on that side of the
Atlantic. It is still widely held that the
U.S. Treasury will have exhausted its
stock of the metal available for sale
by the end of next year.
Even the drastic cut in use of silver
for U.S. coins and the melting of old
coins will not enable supply to match
demand, according to some estimates.
What happens depends on many un-
knowns, including the Treasury’s atti-
tude, but some price lift is widely re-
garded as a safe bet, and probably;
within a year.
WORLD rubber production (in-
cluding smaller stockpile sales)
should almost meet consumption,
next year. The Rubber Study Group
recently estimated 1966 production and
stockpile releases at 2.44 million tons
—• 130,000 tons below use.
Production next year, with expected
increases in Malaysia and Indonesia,
would be 2.575 million tons, 5000 tons
below demand. The forecast two per-
cent rise in natural rubber consump-
tion is the same, quantitatively, as that
for synthetic 60,000 tons.
According to the Study Group, syn-
thetic will provide 56 percent of 1967’s
total consumption 3.38 million tons
out of 5.96 million. Meanwhile, rubber
prices, after their recovery of about
£d. (stg.) a lb. from the 18d. Septem-
ber low, ha\fe held steady in recent
weeks.
COCOA prices are at present at &
level which comes close to satis-
fying both producers and con-
sumers. But the market will not hold
these levels of its own accord, and
negotiations continue in the hope of
giving some stability to the picture.
Around £stg.lBs a ton is nicely below
the £2OO or so level at which choco-
late sales begin to be affected and well
above the £l5O prices which begin to
leave the West African producers be-
low the profit line.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Although most of the industrial sectional indexes moved
ahead moderately, some of the vigor tended to fade toward
the end of the week. Among finance issues, the Bank of
N.S.W. put on a handy 10 cents to reach $5.06, while Queens-
land Insurance managed a 15 cent gain to $4.40. Felt and
Textiles went 4 cents below par to 46 cents. Oils especially
were brightened by Ampol Exploration’s 16 cent jump to
$1.09, A.0.G., at $1.90, posted a more circumspect 7 cent
addition. Minerals took a strong push from such as C.R.A. (up
16 cents), Mt. Morgan (12 cents), and Mt. Lyell (7 cents).

NOT ALL PLAY FOR LOCAL TOYS
Manufacturers talk of need for another tariff inquiry
THE Australian toy industry needs
a Santa Claus. At a time when
millions of pounds are being
spent on toys that Santa Clauses all
over the country will soon be putting
into children’s stockings, large sections
of the local toy industry are in serious
trouble from foreign competition. The
Santa Claus it needs is in the Tariff
Board.
Australian toy men say that only in
Australia are there so many toys from
other countries. To a large degree
this is due to a combination of a
high standard of living and a small
market that limits production runs.
If other circumstances beyond the con-
trol of the Australian manufacturer,
such as wage rises (which often occur
in the middle of the selling season
after he has set his price), high freights,
sales tax which adds to the final selling
costs, and lack of adequate protective
tariffs, cause him to lose more and
more of his home market, there will
not be much future for him. The
present tariffs were fixed when the
basic wage was much lower and have
little effect on the cost of imported
goods today.
There is talk of asking the Govern-
ment for another tariff board inquiry,
and if charges of dumping can be
substantiated, an emergency tariff
would have to be imposed quickly be-
fore it is too late for many local toy
men.
There is no doubt about the quality
of the Australian-made toy. It is
unique and well made on world stand-
ards; in many cases the quality is too
high, perhaps, for the producer’s own
good, because the articles do not wear
out. Metal cars are made of the same
gauge metal as the real thing; paint
used is lead-free; most of the designs
are highly original; the standards of
safety are high; the leather playsuits
are so well made that the child grows
out of them before they wear out; the
gymnasium equipment is made to stand
up to tough use; the doll designs are
appealing and the standard of dressing
is equal to, if not better than, world
standards. The local maker is reluctant
to cut his quality and perhaps reduce
costs.
Over 700 Makers
there are over 100 toy manu-
facturers in Australia. Of these,
about 50-odd are registered with the
Chamber of Manufactures and belong
to the Toy Association. Scores of others
are small concerns, perhaps one family,
who make a few wooden or soft toys
and sell their whole output to one re-
tail store. But together the industry em-
ploys many thousands of workers.
The largest manufacturer is Cyclops
& Lines Bros. (Aust.) Ltd., employing
well over 500 workers. Their business
has changed vastly over the years. A
major share of the company was
acquired by Lines Bros, of England in
1956, though the Australian company
is still run by the Australian members
of the board. The tie-up with overseas
has helped them to expand.
Today they are as much a buying
and selling house as a manufacturing
firm. They carry agency lines from
overseas in addition to their locally
manufactured range. But it is only be-
cause they have changed their business
to fit the changing patterns that they
have managed to stay on top.
Just prior to the war local manu-
facturers were supplying two-thirds of
the Australian toy needs. In 1938-39
toy production amounted to $1,312,000,
whilst the landed value of overseas toys
was $690,000. When war broke out the
toy industry was classed as unessential.
Those who could, such as Boomaroo
Products Pty. Ltd., pressed metal manu-
facturers, switched to munitions and
aircraft parts and other defence require-
ments.
After the war, when imports were
restricted, the Australian manufacturer
gained considerable ground in the local
market. But when import restrictions
were eased the overseas products
flooded the market. In the 1950-51
period the value of imported toys ex-
ceeded the value of toys produced in
Australia, and in the following year the
value of imports rose to the staggering
figure of $4,510,000. This, at an import-
ant growth stage of the Australian toy
industry, caused a serious setback.
Many of the toy manufacturers found
their businesses going downhill. In
panic they pressed for a Tariff Board
inquiry. This was granted in 1955, and
recommended tariff increase of per-
cent ad valorem for most toys, with the
exception of a few wheel toys, on top
of the rate of duty then applicable of
17| percent British preferential tariff
(also applicable to goods originating in
Canada and N.Z.), 45 percent inter-
mediate tariff applicable to practically
all other countries of origin, and
percent general tariff. Toy manufactur-
ers were dismayed to find that the
recommendation was not implemented.
It seemed like the death knell of
much of the industry. Some manufac-
turers went to the wall; others retired
to lick their wounds and survey the
scene. Through the Toy and Games
Manufacturers’ Association, a division
of the Chamber of Manufactures, they
started a vigorous public relations cam-
paign to bring home to the buying
public the advantages of buying Aust
tralian-made goods.
From 1952 to 1960 the import of toys
remained virtually the same, at the
four-million-dollar mark, fluctuating
up and down, until in 1960 it started
to rise again. In 1964-65 it reached an
all-time high of $9,054,472. Preliminary
figures released by the Bureau of Cen-
sus and Statistics for 1965-66 reveal
that it has risen by a further 37 percent.
The doll industry, a highly competi-
tive business world-wide, has been one
of the hardest hit by overseas competi-
tion. Kent Dolls, who had been manu-
facturing since 1931, went out of busi-
ness after the abortive Tariff Board
inquiry. Moulded Products Pty. Ltd.
stopped making dolls because of the
competition from Canada. And a
Canadian firm, Star Dolls, who tried
to establish a manufacturing plant in
Australia, failed. They returned to
Canada, where they are still success-
fully manufacturing dolls. One of the
few doll manufacturers left in Australia
is Cyclops, which works on very fine
margins to compete, but is, nevertheless,
doing well.
Dolls come from every country in the
world. And unlike the pre-war days,
when the type of doll virtually remained
the same, styles are continually
changing.
The Range of Imports
''J'HE wheel-toy industry has also felt
the effect of imports, although they
make up only a small proportion of
sales. Despite the cost of freight and
duty, some come in from Spain, U.K.,
Holland, U.S.A., Czechoslovakia and
many other countries. The latest in the
field is Red China. Usually only one
job line is offered, such as a scooter. It
is thought that in some cases the goods
are subsidised by the country of origin.
The local product is well made by com-
parison and the local manufacturer
also offers a complete range of wheel
toys, and so few importers can succeed
against the local makers. The fact re-
mains that in certain items he is being
undersold and the shops are, stocking
them because there is a higher profit
margin. The main companies in the
wheel-toy field are Cyclops and
C.C.M.C. in Sydney and Hi-Speed in
Victoria.
Battery toys also figure high on the
list of imports. They are mainly manu-
factured in Hong Kong, where the
labor is cheap. Because of their novelty
they appear in most shops as something
different and gimmicky to appeal to
both parent and child alike. Their
value as a toy is questionable, as once
the battery is finished they are too
often discarded. And though the num-
ber of battery-operated toys manufac-
tured locally would be negligible, their
import is still a threat to the local toy
manufacturer because every imported
toy bought is one less sale for the Aus-
tralian manufacturer.
The plastic-toy manufacturers are
experiencing considerable difficulty be-

cause of the anomalies in the tariff. An
inquiry is being held at the moment.
Driclad Pty. Ltd. largely manufacture
inflatable plastic toys and swimming-
pools, using plastic film. To help pro-
tect the local manufacturers of plastic
film, an emergency tariff has been im-
posed on the imported raw material.
Importers are now bringing in made-
up inflatable plastic toys from Hong
Kong cheaper than Driclad can pur-
chase the plastic sheeting. Fortunately
they are not solely dependent on toys.
They also manufacture rainwear and
a variety of products related to the pack-
aging industry. But the continued
existence of their toy section is in some
doubt.
One of the most highly competitive
sections of the toy industry is in the
manufacture of injection or blow-
moulded plastic toys. Moulded Products,
one of the largest in this field, makes
many other products. Very few plastics
manufacturers are solely dependent on
toys. There are some very successful
local makers, like Alex Tolner with his
Toltoys, who have found the answer
to the intense local and overseas com-
petition. A large proportion of the
imported plastic toys consists of the
so-called “whinging toys,” which sell
from five cents to about 25 cents. They
are the impulse sales and the bread
and butter of the toy departments
throughout the year.
Threat from New Zealand
QNCE again, because of the labor and
tooling costs, it is difficult for the
local man to compete. The cost of pre-
paring a sample of one single plastic
toy, before even going into production,
is in the vicinity of $2OOO. Most new
plastic toys hit the market hard and
have a two-year run before going out
of fashion. To continually set up for
new designs for a market of only 11
million people is uneconomical. And to
try to export to the low-income
countries, where they work longer hours
for less money and can produce similar
items foj- a fraction of the cost, is out
of the question. If he does decide to
gamble on a new line and spend the
money on tooling, he runs the risk of
another manufacturer coming out with
a similar line at the same time, or of
a cheap imported copy selling against
him.
Two firms which have felt overseas
competition keenly and are still suffer-
ing are Boomaroo Products and Wyn
Products. They manufacture metal cars
and similar toys. Earlier, when mount-
ing imports threatened their business,
they both switched part of their plant
to the manufacture of car parts. But
when the recession hit the motor-car
industry they were hit, also. Boomaroo,
which once employed a staff of 120,
now employs only 70 and has never
fully recovered.
The latest threat is coming via N.Z.
in the form of metal toys. These bear
the “Made in N.Z.” trade mark. Con-
ditions governing entry of dies and
parts for goods intended for re-export
are treated more favorably by the N.Z.
Government than in Australia. The dies
come in under a scheme which allows
for the cost to be rebated when they
are returned to the country of origin.
Provided the goods exported contain
50 percent of N.2s. workmanship and
material they are marked “Made in
N.Z.” and enter Australia under a
British preferential tariff.
It is believed that a proportion of
the parts are manufactured in U.S.A.
and Hong Kong. Australia has no re-
bate scheme operating for the use of
overseas dies. The Australian manufac-
turer carries all the cost, and tooling
up for new lines becomes an expensive
business. Because of this he is unable
to offer the wide variety in his range
which other imported lines such as
“Tonka” can offer. “Tonka” has been
able to cut into the market of the local
manufacturers, even though it is not
widely advertised. The range is wide
and varied, the finish is as good if not
better than the local product, and the
wholesaler gets a higher profit margin.
In some cases it is believed that the
prices quoted to wholesalers here appear
to be cheaper than those quoted in
N.Z. And to make matters worse, the
N.Z. licensing does not allow for made-
up toys to be sold to N.Z., so that
retaliation on that market is denied
them.
Two years ago Mr. Hugh Findlay, of
Boomaroo, went overseas to try to build
up an export trade. He was moderately
successful at first, but then with ever-
increasing local costs, such as raw
materials, freight, and wages, he found
it unprofitable. One recent shipment
to South America, worth $2200, cost
$760 to freight. (High freight costs also
work in favor of local makers against
imports, especially of bulky items like
wheel toys and pushalongs.)
Morelia and Co., manufacturers of
toy koalas, have been one of the few
successful in the export trade. They
use kangaroo skins in the manufacture
and their product is unique. Part of
their success must be attributed to the
fact that the koala and the kangaroo
skin they use are unique to Australia.
Because of the seasonal nature of the
toy industry, the manufacturer has to
budget for about eight months of the
year to pay his staff and meet his bills
for raw materials. He prepares his
sample range for the year early in
January and shows it around the whole-
sale trade. He may get a token order
for samples, but has to wait until
August before he gets his first order
and sometimes as late as November.
In the meantime the buyers place their
orders for overseas toys early in the
year. Most large firms send their repre-
sentatives abroad. If they spend too
much overseas or make an error in
judgment they are cut down on what
they can spend with the local manu-
facturer.
This puts the local man in a pre-
carious position. He is without finance
until late in the year and also needs
a large warehouse space to store his
made-up stock. He cannot afford to
wait until he gets his order before he
goes into production, as most buyers
expect immediate delivery. And because
of the intense local competition, he has
to comply. No one manufacturer has a
monopoly over any one line, so that he
must endeavor to give the utmost
service to hold his business.
Some manufacturers successfully
combine other lines, which they sell all
through the year. The major business
of Hills Hoists Pty. Ltd. is in clothes-
lines in addition to outdoor playground
equipment. Precision Springs Pty. Ltd.
work mainly in the industrial field, with
a comparatively small toy section. Other
firms, such as Sebels (Aust.) Ltd.,
manufacturers of steel furniture, have
found it more profitable to go out of
toys altogether.
High Pressure Advertising
JN some ways the Australian manu-
facturer has been caught napping by
the sudden advent of toys which have
been heavily backed by high pressure
TV advertising. Some of the toys are
“oncers” gimmick toys. The import-
ers allow 10 percent of a shipment cost
for advertising. They build up a pro-
motion peak over a three-week period,
creating a public demand. At the same
time they sell hard to the wholesaler
and retailer. They then quit that line
and look around for another.
Other firms with a range of toys who
wish to break into the market spread
their money over a longer period. Lin-
coln International is a good example
of this. By the use of TV they have
established themselves in the field of
building sets, displacing Buzza Products
and Ezi-Bilt, both local firms, and to
some extent British Mecanno. They
have also taken some business from
British Lego, a comparative newcomer
to the field, who had marked success
about seven years ago. Many of the
Lincoln toys are branded “Made in
Hong Kong.” They are colorful, well-
packed, and obviously appeal to the
customer, even though they are not
terribly cheap. And they have caught
the children’s attention with well-
directed advertising.
Because he has been raised in an
era of price-consciousness, where the
buyer has held the threat of cheaper
imported merchandise over his head,
the local man has been reluctant to
spend large sums on advertising. Cer-
tainly he has supported the “Made in
Australia” campaign, but it is no longer
good enough to shelter under the blan-
ket advertising of the Toy Association
and the “catch-cry,” buy Australian.
Perhaps he has a just claim that the
people to whom he gives work should
support him in return by buying his
products. But the public does not always
look at things in that light. It has
long been convinced that the imported
product is superior, and it is up to the
makers to disprove this view. And the
public is not a charity supporting the
Australian toy industry out of the kind-
ness of its heart. The public is not Santa
Claus.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
What to Pay for CIG
COMMONWEALTH INDUS-
TRIAL GASES LIMITED has
just announced its profit for the
year to October 1, 1966, and consoli-
dated net profit after tax was down
nearly 16 percent. Pre-tax consolidated
profit was down by nearly 18 percent.
The market certainly seems to have
anticipated a drop in per share earnings,
for over the past four months the
share price has declined steadily from
$2.70 down to $2.25 a fall of about
percent.
While the name would imply that
industrial gases are by far the most
important side of ClG’s activities, it
seems fairly clear that the supply of
equipment is also a substantial activity.
In the equipment field there are
other competitors and some of these
also have well-respected names in their
fields. An example would be Lincoln
Electric Co. in the electric welding
machine field.
CIG has disclosed total turnover for
many years, and the 1965 annual report
gives a seven-year comparison of profits
and funds employed. The following
schedule has been derived from these
figures:
Year to 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Net profit after
tax % sales 11.5 10.3 9.9 9.7 10.0 9.5 8.2
% Average funds
employed 13.0 13.0 12.0 11.7 11.7 11.6 9.5
Sales % averaae
funds employed 113 125 121 121 117 122 116
I think that these figures speak for
themselves. Sales as a percentage of
funds employed have been well main-
tained. In other words, new invest-
ment has resulted in sales increases
roughly comparable to the amount of
the new investment. However, the net
margin on sales has been declining
fairly steadily throughout the whole of
this seven year period. It also appears
likely that the trend has continued
into 1966, for the half-yearly report
stated: . . . though sales . . . were
affected by depressed conditions in
certain sectors of the economy, the
overall volume showed a modest in-
crease on the corresponding period last
year. Profits, however, were lower due
to increased costs ...”
The importance of this gradual re-
duction in margins seemed to elude
investors for a number of years and it
is strange, to say the least, that from
1959 until 1962 the average price/
earnings multiple continued to increase.
From then on this multiple has varied
between 16 and 18. Currently the
shares are selling at $2.25, or 14.7 times
1965-66 earnings.
The reason for this lack of concern
with the shrinking margins probably
stems from the rising trend in per share
earnings until 1963-64. Unfortunately,
it does not appear to have been noticed
that this rate of growth was not much
more than 4 percent per annum com-
pound. Even if this growth could
have been expected to continue in
perpetuity, the price/earnings multiple
in my view should not have exceeded
16.7. If the growth period had been
limited to five years, then the multiple
should not have exceeded 14.7. In
other words, the shares of CIG (prob-
ably in common with a number of
other “popular” stocks) were over-
valued from 1962 to 1965.
The question now is whether this
over-valuation still exists, even though
the share price is 32 percent down on
the high point for 1966.
In July, 1965, when announcing the
one-for-two share issue at par, the
directors said that the company was
embarking on a $30 million expansion
program which would be financed
roughly with $5 million from the new
equity issue, $10 million from deben-
ture borrowing, and $15 million from
retained profits over a period of three
years* On the basis of past perform-
ance, this new investment might be
expected to increase sales by about $36
million. Unfortunately, the prospect on
this occasion of increasing sales in re-
lation to capital invested seems rather
remote, for it would mean more than
doubling the 1964/65 sales value. As
sales only increased by 78 percent from
1957/58 to 1964/65 (a seven-year
period), it is unlikely that sufficient de-
mand exists to bring about such a sub-
stantial increase.
JF I am generous and suggest that sales
will increase by 50 percent from
1964/65 to 1967/68 and if I think that
the percentage of net profit after tax
to sales in 1964/65 was exceptionally
low, I might be able to estimate an
earning rate for 1967/68 of about 24 j
percent. This would assume that the
drift in the percentage of net profit to
sales would have continued at the rate
of 1960 through to 1964. We do not yet
know the percentage for 1965/66, but
it is likely to be down quite markedly
on the low 8.2 percent of 1964/65. If
the sales for 1965/66 should be the
same as for 1964/65, then the percent-
age will fall to about 7 percent. ' A
projection of the trends from 1963/64
onwards could lead to the conclusion
that the earning rate in 1967/68 will
have fallen to percent even if sales
increase by 50 percent to about $52
million.
The foregoing indicates the scope
that exists for differing opinions on the
future trend in CIG’s earning rate, but
it is significant that the most optimistic
forecast only suggests a return to the
earning rate levels of 1959-1962. Even
the current price would require growth
in earnings per share of 4 percent
per annum compound for the next five
years to justify it.

MAN ON THE LAND
Party Lines for Wool
THE old crack about the difference
between the Republicans and the
Democrats (what do you mean,
there’s no difference—they’re in and
we’re out) has a certain application
in Australian farm politics. There is
talk, right now, of a new marketing
plan for wool. We would not care to
dismiss this talk as mere rumor. There
is something to it, but any idea that the
defeated reserve price plan will be re-
introduced by means of a referendum
seems remote.
Actually, it would be safe to say there
is no exact, or near-exact, plan as
such. Speculation is therefore permis-
sible. There are many plans, and out
of them all something could materialise.
The key, in our view, is not so much
moves in the woolgrowing industry
itself but moves in shipping. Con-
tainerisation is going to have a
tremendous impact on wool in Aus-
tralia. So is the imminent U.K. entry
into the Common Market. Both, it
would appear, could be good for wool.
Containerisation should reduce ship-
ping charges and U.K. entry into the
Common Market should help revive the
British textile industry, in wool parties
larly.
Existing conference line shipping
charges on wool are irksome and it is
claimed that independents have quoted
25 percent less. But the conference
line ships offer a service which is in-
valuable, in that ships will lift a cargo
of wool from an Australian port within
16 days of sale at auction and deliver
it to a number of ports overseas. In
this context the conference rates may
not be too high.
The independents would doubtless
carry for 25 percent less, but would
want to charge a set fee for picking
up a set amount at a given time. Under
the auction system, as it exists, this
might not always be easy to arrange.
The advent of containerisation may well
mean that the wool will have to be
ready, in set amounts at a given time,
and that the industry will have to
adjust accordingly.
ONE plan, which has been discussed,
is to lift substantial quantities of
wool to overseas destinations (London,
Japan, Boston, etc.) and to sell it there
by auction. Set cargoes could be shipped
at freight savings, immediately, by using
independent lines. Thus the conference
lines would get competition. Eventually,
when containerisation becomes the rule,
there may be no need of a choice
between conference lines and indepen-
dents.
Inherent in this system would be
broker approval. This is by no means
impossible to imagine, for many brokers
functioned in this manner in their in-
fancy and grew from London-based
broking houses. Inherent also would be
a degree of private buying.
Again it is not impossible to imagine
broker entry, or re-entry, into private
buying. In the early days many a broker
galloped out along the Parramatta
Road to buy wool from the wagon.
Up-dated, this would mean brokers
offering the farmer a choice of sending
his wool overseas or selling it immedi-
ately on the farm. Brokers, as pastoral
houses, have the capacity to offer a
range of services.
In Western Australia, we have, today,
far less distinction between the role of
broker and private buyer than is the
case in the eastern States, where the
two are quite separate. While suck a
system seems feasible, it also raises the
possibility of some form of appraisal
scheme in Australia. Into this category
comes the Addis Plan in Western Aus-

tralia. Under this plan, advanced by
Mr. Arthur Addis, of Nyabing, growers
would elect leaders by secret ballot.
These leaders would confer with manu-
facturers’ representatives and would
grade and value the clip. The values
agreed upon would remain in force for
one year. Price fluctuations would be
eliminated.
A third form of marketing, a centrally
controlled acquisition scheme, appears
to be favored in some quarters. Under
this system a wool marketing authority
would be set up which would purchase
wool from growers at a set price. The
authority would then resell (as a giant
private buyer, so to speak) overseas.
It would, automatically, seek to become
the sole selling authority (like the Aus-
tralian Wheat Board) and this system
has the greatest inherent danger of
coming under bureaucratic domination.
The grower voice, in these matters,
will come from the Australian Wool
Industry Conference. Under its new
chairman,. Sir Ewen Waterman, it
appears to have more chance of arriving
at grower unity than in the past. Sir
Ewen, unlike his two predecessors,
appears well qualified to take a leading
role as conference chairman. A large
woolgrower, he also has a wealth of
business experience. He is on the board
of Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort and
is a director of Onkaparinga Woollen
Mills. He was IWS chairman from
1952 to 1954—before the era of Sir
William Gunn and Mr. W. J. Vines.
S IR EWEN has the all-important
quality of being able to get along
with all kinds of people. Among wool-
growers this is rare. He is generally
considered to have played a leading
part in getting the Federal Government
to increase the promotion contribution
to dollar-for-dollar across the board.
The Government contribution of
approximately $l4 million should stifle
grower opposition to the 2 percent levy
(on growers) which is to be re-
negotiated at the February meeting of
the AWIC.
Sir Ewen has said that woolgrower
divisions lead nowhere. It is to be
hoped that he can convince the AWIC
that this is so. If divisions do occur,
it will be along the same two-party
lines that show up in farm politics
generally. The Wool and Meat Pro-
ducers’ Federation side of the AWIC
will favor a central authority similar
to the Wheat Board and will not be
too concerned about the morality of
eventual taxpayer subsidy. The Wool-
growers and Graziers’ Council will favor
some system to take advantage of con-
tainerisation and lower freights, but
will try to preserve existing freedoms
of choice, a minimum of bureaucratic
interference, and dependence on Gov-
ernment subsidy.
As the wool industry is, however,
already a subsidised industry, and as
the history of subsidies shows they are
never cut back, the average taxpayer
will probably wonder what, really, is the
difference.

Poor Record with Brucellosis
FOR almost a generation we have
possessed the means and know-
how to eradicate brucellosis (con-
tagious abortion) in cattle. Yet the
results, recently published, of a survey
covering just two dairying districts in
south-western Victoria remind us that
progress has been disappointingly slow.
It would seem that the disease still
occurs on nearly 40 percent of the farms
in this area. On almost 20 percent of
them, more than five percent of the
cattle are infected. About eight percent
of the properties surveyed had more
than ten percent of their cows infected.
Probably, at least three percent of all
cattle in the area are infected.
The survey was conducted by the
Victorian Department of Agriculture’s
district veterinary officer, Mr. A. J.
Turner, stationed at Colac. The facts
and figures appear in the current issue
of the Australian Veterinary Journal.
Possibly Mr. Turner’s most salutary
finding is that the farmers who had
practised a program of annual vaccina-
tion with Strain 19 for ten years or so
had virtually clean herds. Depending on
the culling rate, a farmer could reach
this laudable point by the end of seven
years. “It would appear,” he says, “that
only time ... is necessary to reduce the
incidence within an infected herd to a
very low level.” On this arithmetic we
should have eradicated brucellosis twice
over by now.
The survey also emphasised the
importance of good herd management
in checking the spread of the disease.
Farmers who bought in mature cows
for herd replacement had about three
times as many animals showing signs
of the disease than farmers who kept
closed herds. The introduction of in-calf
heifers, however, does not appear to
carry much risk. Presumably, on most
farms, whether the farmers are aware
or not of the dangers of brucellosis,
it is the practice to rear the calves and
weaners out of contact with the milkers.
It is also a commendable and ap-
parently practised procedure to join
the heifers with young, preferably un-
mated, bulls.
r JpEN percent of the farmers contacted
during the survey had never vac-
cinated their calves. They, naturally,
had the highest numbers of diseased
cattle. Interestingly, some of the farmers
who had been regular vaccinators said
that they were going to stop. These
people had an eye on the export market
for stud stock. Several importing
countries now insist that only cattle
with completely clear blood tests will
be allowed in. The trouble with Strain
19 vaccination is that it often causes
a persistent and sometimes permanent
positive test. Hence vaccinated animals
cannot be distinguished easily from
active carriers. Stud owners could use
the so-called 45/20 vaccine instead. It
does not confound the interpretation of
subsequent blood tests. The main objec-
tion to this vaccine is that it causes a
severe reaction in the calves at the
site of injection. Moreover, two doses
at a six-week interval must be given
to obtain satisfactory immunity. This
is bothersome and more costly.
And the mention of export market-
ing and overseas countries also serve
to remind us of our invidious record in
brucellosis control. Neither man nor
beast in the Scandinavian countries
and Holland is threatened by the
disease. Those countries were able to
declare themselves brucella-free many
years ago. West Germany and Bulgaria
are about to join this club. Canada, a
vast territory like Australia with
rather similar practical difficulties to
overcome in disseminating the vaccine
and providing diagnostic services, now
has complete eradication in sight.
'J’HE U.S.A. has a national eradica-
tion program. Under it the whole
country is scheduled to be free of
the disease by 1975. Some individual
States are already free. California
hopes to declare itself free this *ime
next year and the other west coast
States may also make the same claim
at the same time. Great Britain recently
announced a plan which is to begin
next year with the ultimate goal of
eradication.
Obviously, the parts of the world
in which we may freely sell our cattle
and certain animal products are
shrinking and rather quickly. With
an eye to export trading in the future
our present excuses for following a
perfunctory policy on brucellosis con-
trol seem somewhat weak. As an added
incentive for greater efforts at control
it is well to remember that brucella
abortus is one of the relatively few
animal pathogens that afflicts man. It
causes undulant fever a recurring,
debilitating sickness. Doctors find it
difficult to diagnose and so there are
probably more cases than the number
reported. It is not passed from man
to man but is picked up by direct
contact with infected animals or their
products. Drinking unpasteurised milk
is particularly dangerous. More than
half Britain’s vets are said to have
suffered from the fever. Vets, at least,
have good cause to be enthusiastic
about any eradication campaign.
But the economic consequences of the
disease and its threat to overseas sales
provide ample reason for us to mount
a more vigorous effort to achieve con-
trol. Brucellosis can not only impede
reproduction in dairy and beef herds,
but also lower milk production by as
much as 30 percent. Tasmania has set
the mainland an example. That State
took brucellosis seriously about ten
years ago and now, to all intents and
purposes, is “clean.”


Chess Bulletin
VICTOR KORCHNOI
Y\7HO is the best chess player in the
world? Tigran Petrosyan, who has
only recently successfully defended his
title of world champion? Boris Spassky,
who, although defeated by Petrosyan
in their world title challenge match,
finished well above him in the recent
Pidiagorsky tournament? Bobby
Fischer, the young American genius?
According to Roger Cook, the N.S.W.
gradings officer, the highest graded
player in the world is U.S.S.R. Grand-
master, Victor Korchnoi.
In what may well prove to be the
most controversial article on chess ever
published in Australia, Cook has in-
cluded the gradings of the world’s top
135 players.
Here is Roger Cook’s list of the first
five in the world, together with a simi-
lar list produced in Engelhardt’s chess
year book and one from “Chess Life,”
the American publication of April, 1964.
ROGER COOK, 1966: 1, Korchnoi; 2,
Fischer; 3-4, Spassky, Stein; 5, Petro-
syan.
ENGELHARDT, 1965: 1-2, Spassky
and Tal; 3, Fischer; 4, Petrosyan; 5,
Smyslov.
CHESS LIFE, 1964: 1-2, Petrosyan
and Fischer; 3, Keres; 4-5, Botvinnik
and Geller.
In support of Cook’s ratings it may
be remembered that last year in the
match Leningrad v. Moscow, a double
rounder, Korchnoi met Petrosyan on
board one and won both games.
Here is the first of those encounters:
White: V. Korchnoi.
Black: T. Petrosyan.
Opening: Nimzo-Indian Defence.
1. P-Q4, N-KB3; 2. P-QB4, P-K3; 3.
N-QB3, B-N5; 4. P-K3, 0-0; 5. N-83,
P-B4; 6. B-K2, BxNch; 7. Pxß, P-QN3;
8. N-Q2;
Korchnoi positions his minor pieces
in readiness for a central pawn thrust.

avoid the pawn loss by 19 . . . Q-N2??
he loses his Bishop after 20. Q-R4.

B-N2, Q-Kl; 22. B-KBl. R-Nl; 23.
B-83, P-K4; 24. B-Q3, B-Bl; 25. N-81,
KR-N 2; 26. B-B2;
Very nice play by Korchnoi. The
world champion has doubled his Rooks
on an open file, usually a terrific
advantage. In this situation, however,
Black’s Rooks are all “dressed up but
nowhere to go.”
26 . . . P-QR 3; 27. N-K3, N-Bl; 28.
Q-KBI, P-R3; 29. R-Kl, N(R1)-R2; 30.
P-84, N-N5; 31. NxN, BxN; 32. P-R3,
B-Q2; 33. Q-N2, P-B3; 34. R(K1)-KB1.
White’s attack now looks menacing,
Black should consider 34 . . . B-R5, thus
making full use of his “strong” Rooks.
34 . . . Q-Ql?; 35. R-Rl;
Korchnoi now makes sure that his
opponent does not get a second chance
at the breakthrough mentioned in the
last note.
35 . . . Q-K2; 36. K-81, Q-Kl; 37. K-K2,
Q-QRI; 38. P-B5;
Further blocking of the position.
Korchnoi, however, has just a little
edge where ease of movement is con-
cerned. It is Petrosyan who makes a
bid for freedom.
38 . . . R-N5!?;
A brilliant sacrifice if it comes off.
Perhaps foolhardy if it doesn’t. Still,
Black had to do something to avoid
slow strangulation.
39. BxR, Pxß; 40. B-N3, Q-B4; 41.
K-81, N-N4; 42. R-K2, Q-Q5; 43. R-Nl,
Q-Q6; 44. R-N2, B-Kl; 45. P-R4,
N-B6!?;
Black has escaped from his world of
darkness all right, but is he fully pre-
pared for the hustle and bustle of his
new surroundings?
46. K-82, N-Q5;
Had an average player made this
move it would immediately be classified
as an elementary blunder,’ as it cuts off
the Queen’s only possible means of
escape. With Petrosyan, though, the
situation is different and one can
visualise the excitement this move
would have caused in an auditorium
packed with spectators.
47. R-K3, Q-B6; 48. RxQ;
There she goes . . . but not alone!
48 . . . PxR; 49. R-Nl, Rxß; 50. RxR,
NxR; 51. K-K3, N-Q5; 52. Q-QR 2,
P-B7; 53. K-Q3, B-R4; 54. P-B5!, PxP;
55. P-Qoch, B-B2; 56. Q-R4, Resigns.
How strange it. is that after all the
intrigue it is White’s lowly Queen’s
pawn that causes the champion of the
world to admit defeat.

SPECULATORS DIARY
On Being Astute in Hong Kong
THOSE investors who find it difficult to keep up with our own stockmarket
should be grateful that they don’t live in Hong Kong. If there is such an
animal as an international equity investor, it would be found in that far-flung
British outpost. Not only do they have their local market to contend with, but also
within their reach are the American, British, Japanese, and even Australian stock-
markets.
Consequently an astute Hong Kong
investor would know the current market
price of Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation
and Pye (U.K.) on the London Ex-
change, whereas his Australian counter-
part if asked would probably be
stumped. Yet the market price of each
has a significant bearing on the market
price of their respective locally listed
subsidiaries.
Based on a market price of 37/6 stg.,
Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation has a mar-
ket capitalisation of about s34om. Now
let’s turn to the Australian subsidiary,
CRA. After the 3-for-10 bonus issue,
there are just on 80m. shares on issue.
Based on a market price of $5, the
market capitalisation of CRA is
s4oom. As Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation
has an 85 percent shareholding in
CRA, the value of its holding in
CRA is s34om. Yet that is all the
English market is valuing the whole
of Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation.
Does this mean, then, the vast
uranium deposits in Canada, the copper
interests in Africa, and a multitude of
other activities have no value at all?
Or does it mean that CRA is over-
priced? Perhaps Mr. Blake Pelly, who
has been so quick to point out the
over-pricing of Mary Kathleen Uranium
shares, can explain the phenomenon.
To me it simply appears a repeat of
what happened to quality industrial
shares in Australia in 1960. At that time,
when the yield on an industrial share
was below 2 percent, exponents of the
share angrily said current yield didn’t
matter and what was important was
capital appreciation. How many in-
dustrial shares now yield less than 4
percent, let alone 2 percent? After the
bonus issue, CRA shows a dividend
yield of percent.
Pye (U.K.) is now selling at 9/- stg.
This follows the partial takeover offer
of 8/- for every 5/- share made by
Philips. However, Pye directors re-
garded the offer as inadequate. Even
if Philips does not come back with a
better offer, there are other interested
parties, including Thorn, hovering in the
background. A partial takeover offer
either by Philips or Thorn could only
strengthen, not weaken, the prospects
of the local company. Yet there seems
no other reason for the new low of 90
cents.
At last, Pye Industries Ltd. of Aus-
tralia seems to be shaking off the
shackles that have hindered its progress
in recent years. First of all it was bad
debts cutting into profits. Then came
the minor economic recession, high-
lighted by the performance of the two
most tender industries in the economy.
As the largest rpanufacturer of car-
burretors in Australia and also as one
of the leading appliance manufacturers,
Pye just could not escape the depressed
state of the automotive and appliance
industry.
While neither of these industries have
staged sudden recoveries, there are
positive signs of revival. Pye appliance
sales have also been helped along by
the success of the recently introduced
four-year service plan. Of course, Pye
activities are not confined to these
industries. For example, those seeking
an investment in the defence industry
would find it hard to overlook Pye,
who currently hold several large
defence orders, including one for
navigational equipment.
Just how well the company is doing
this year should be revealed in the
interim report, due any day. In the
meantime, I’ve bought 500 shares.
The other purchase of the week was
1000 L. J. Hooker at 33 cents. The
annual report has revived my confi-
dence in the company. We’ll learn more
about it at the annual meeting next
Friday.
To keep the account square I sold
out the 200 Borg Warner at $1.70.
The first loss of the year, $l7, was
notched up.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD

More than 40
'single'whiskies
are married to make one
Johnnie Walker
When you pour yourself a Johnnie
Walker you have more than 40
‘single’ whiskies all in one glass
because it does take that many fine
whiskies to make one Johnnie
Walker. That’s the secret of
Johnnie Walker’s smoothness and
mellowness. And 146 years’ skill in
blending. These different whiskies
come from all over Scotland. Rich,
characterful Glenlivets and
Highland malt whiskies tangy
with the faint taste of smoke from
peat fires. Smooth, rounded Islays.
And clean, fresh-tasting grain
whiskies from the Lowlands. Some
of these whiskies are matured as
long as fifteen years none less
than five. All very smooth. Very
mellow. No wonder Johnnie Walker
is the world’s best-loved Scotch. In
miniatures, 5 oz. and 13 oz. flasks,
13 oz.and 26 oz., square bottles.
