the most thick skinned cars in the world
A BMC car, and BMC alone, gives you the investment and safety protection of
Rotodip 7 skin deep rust protection. Rotodip is unique because car bodies actually
rotate through special cleaning and rustproofing solutions. Result: no air pockets
can form; every inch of the body, inside and out is treated. Rust (it starts on the
inside) can’t form, can't weaken the inherent body strength of your car. Rotodip
rust protection is one reason why your BMC car is safer. Others: BMC’s better
front wheel handling, better braking, unique stay-on-line Hydrolastic* fluid
suspension. You buy a safe car, an advanced car when you buy BMC. There’s one
to suit your needs exactly!

Wynns have taken the
unusual step of making
the 1964 vintage
Coonawarra Estate Hermitage
concurrently available with the
'63, released earlier this year.
This is a somewhat fuller wine
than the ’63, matured 2 years in
oak and 12 months in the bottle,
and makes satisfying drinking
now.
However, it makes an even
better investment. Particularly
at this year’s reasonable price
and in the light of possible
future shortages.
If you’ve got the space, and
the willpower, lay down some
1964 Hermitage now. This
simply means it continues to
mature in your cellar instead
of ours. Apart from the
economic advantages, the fringe
benefit is an undeniable smug
sense of possession and
security. And by buying ’64
now, you gain some 20 to
30 cents a bottle each year.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963 at
Coonawarra was unusually
humid, which seems to have
added subtlety to the wine,
giving it greater delicacy yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove to be
the best Australian Hermitage
ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Cabernet
Following the 1960 vintage,
the 1962 is a bigger wine in
which the oak-maturation and
Cabernet Sauvignon character
form a well balanced soft
symphony of flavour. The
Cabernet is bottled only in
outstanding vintage years, these
have been ’54, ’57, ’5B, ’59, ’6O
and ’62. The 1962 vintage is
now available but only in
limited quantity.

A NEW LIGHT ON EDUCATION . .
A progressively more sophisticated attitude to
education is making the dull, dark and foreboding schoolhouse a thing of the past. Many
of the new designs for schools make extensive use of safety-glass doors, windows,
translucent wails, and even glass roofing. These modern applications of glass are. also
being employed by architects in their designs for factories, office buildings and private
homes.
Further information may be obtained through our Technical Advisory Service. We
suggest you address your enquiries to Mr. W. Lamont, Pilkington Brothers (Australia)
Pty. Ltd., Box 107, Geelong, Victoria.
Pilkington Brothers (Australia) Pty. Ltd. have been engaged in processing safety glass
for more than 25 years . . . constantly producing more advanced products for the glass
age.

Ifyotfveonjythe
vaguest notion of
wnat Qarified Butter is,
Graham Kerr would like
a hundred or so words
with you.
“Clarified Butter is quite simply puredairy
butter with the water, salt and curd re-
moved. In fact, it’s over 99% pure butter-
fat. As it contains no moisture it doesn’t
splutter and foam'when it’s melted. And
because the salt and curd have been
removed, it won’t catch or burn. You can
shallow fry and saute with it and come up
with a perfect job every time. What’s more
you use Clarified Butter at temperatures
lower than those recommended for other
cooking fats and oils. This means protein
fibres are cooked more gently. They don’t
toughen up. And you have to use so little
Clarified Butter in your cooking. Just
enough to cover the bottom of the pan very
lightly. Foods don’t come to the table
groaning with the fat they've absorbed.
But they do come with all the flavour,
nutrition and downright appetite appeal
that only pure dairy butter can give them.
Look, to show you what I mean, get the
little woman to buy some Clarified Butter
(it’s also sold as Ghee or Butter-Oil, by the
way) and nip into the kitchen and try your
hand at this recipe. I'm willing to bet you'll
be won over to Clarified Butter for life."

NATURES FINEST
BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Even "Rock-Fist
Rogan" couldn't
win this one
ACTUALLY IT WASN’T a good
week for the pure glory of the city of
Melbourne. An architect, Mr. Reg
Grouse, said Melbourne was unsatis-
factory for pedestrians, unpleasant at
busy times, dull at quiet times, and
polluted with poisonous fumes. It had
uninteresting, confined, and crowded
spaces, no resting places, no mystery
for the imaginative, and no poetry for
the poetic. All this was in a paper he
presented to a forum on building in
1980, conducted at Melbourne Univer-
sity.
Then the plan for “Greater Mel-
bourne” had another of its little set-
backs. You must appreciate that the
Melbourne City Council never does
things rashly. We first became passion-
ately enthusiastic for a city square in
1856, and, 10, in 1966, just 110 years
later, we won the first beginnings of a
little city square, now at the corner of
Swanston and Collins Streets.
Our big dream has been for a
Greater Melbourne, a super administra-
tion of the whole city, ruled by an all-
powerful mayor, like Lord Mayor Clem
Jones and his Greater Brisbane.
The really big effort was in 1898.
After all, amalgamations were all the
rage in Europe and North America.
There were Greater Londons and
Greater New Yorks. Melbourne just
had to be in it, too. The “Argus”
mounted one of its eloquent campaigns
saying: “Greater Melbourne will en-
able this city to fulfil her destiny and
become the Paris of the Pacific.” Cr.
Turner, of Prahran, said: “The days
of parochialism are over we don’t
want a dozen powers to rule where
one is sufficient.” And Cr. Kemp,
Mayor of St. Kilda, pointed out that
the marvellous St. Kilda esplanade,
instead of merely being the glory of St.
Kilda, could now be the glory of
Greater Melbourne.
The Richmond City Council called
a meeting for October 18, and 22
councils were almost unanimous for
amalgamation. There was just one
drawback. Melbourne City Council
refused to send even an observer. After
all, 1898 was a good land-bust year,
empty unrentable houses everywhere.
The City of Melbourne was un-
enthusiastic about supporting 22 broke
local councils. Well, to continue with
our saga, we tried again in 1936 (no
luck) and again in 1951 (no luck).
This time our Town Clerk, Mr. F.
H. Rogan, went on a world study tour
of local government. Readers of the
old “Champion” in the audience will
remember a marvellous “Champion”
character named “Rock-Fist Rogan.” He
was always depicted punching his
mallet-like fist straight through the
staves of a barrel. Well, our “Rock-Fist
Rogan” produced the Rogan Report. It
called for the amalgamation of eight
inner municipalities Richmond,
Prahran, St. Kilda, Port Melbourne,
South Melbourne, Fitzroy, Collingwood,
and, of course, Melbourne. The Rogan
Report went to a private meeting of
councillors on June 15. It was so top
hush that all copies of the report had
to be signed “in” and then signed “out”
afterwards. All the same marvellous ad-
vantages that were voiced for Greater
Melbourne back in 1898 were voiced
again, economy in administration, bulk
buying, easier town planning, etc.
Frankly, it didn’t go down awfully
well in the suburbs. St. Kilda, for ex-
ample, this time wasn’t keen to hand
over its esplanade for the glory of us
all, and one councillor was heard to
say of the F. H. Rogan Report: “Too
bloody far with F.H.R.”
It all came before the council on
July 24. Our protagonist, the fighter
for Greater Melbourne, and very often
for many of the imaginative schemes in
this town, was Sir Maurice Nathan. But
the opposition was strong. The Right
Wing almost always has had supreme
control in the council chamber. The
thought is now that, if we let in coun-
cils from all over, we will get the same
fearful situation as in Brisbane, with
Labor in command, and even (shudder)
a Labor Lord Mayor.
There was a very heated debate.
The Rogan plan was defeated 13 votes
to 11, and seven councillors of the Civic
group, including Sir Maurice, walked
out. Sir Leo Curtis moved an amend-
ment that Mr. Rogan should prepare
a report on amalgamation with just
three councils, Fitzroy, Port Melbourne,
and South Melbourne. This was carried.
However, Sir Maurice says the scheme
is far from dead and he will try again
in another week.
It is all a little dispiriting, but wait,
your correspondent has another idea.
Why not the Smaller Melbourne plan.
After all, the MCC is the richest council
in Australia, and the Bare-Fist Batman
plan would help to overcome the sub-
urban inferiority complexes. If we cut
the MCC in size to the boundaries of
Spring, Latrobe, Flinders, and Spencer
Streets, then the other councils would
pick up marvellous, valuable territory.
Richmond would get the MCG and the
Treasury Gardens, South Melbourne
would get the Shrine, Fitzroy the Police
Department and Trades Hall, and
Footscray could even have Festival Hall
and Spencer St. Station.
Oh, yes, just you wait. We’ll create
the Paris of the Pacific yet.

TREGREHAN CLARET
OUT AND

Design for a
Carnaby Street
take-over
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
“IF YOU REALLY want a story,” says
the male model, “then I’ve got one.
Ack-sherly ‘Vogue’ have done me, but
—” Mr. Cyril Klein, of Daroff’s men’s
wear, is shelling out a fortune for this
party to launch his fashion-accented
suits, but he is down the room explain-
ing population explosion to 2UE’s Bob
Rogers and misses this skulduggery.
For the past couple of hours, Mr.
Klein has been under certain pressures.
All that Pat Woodley’s agency can pro-
vide is one regular-size 40 man and
two who say they are regular but
certainly aren’t, they bulge out of Mr.
Klein’s clothes, and none of them knows
the meaning of speed. Also, Mr. Klein’s
own fashion-accented suit is still un-
finished, and he is wearing a vintage ’65
two-piece with unfashionable short
vents in the jacket. His new Stetson hats
aren’t through, either, but in this busi-
ness the boss gets served last. All this
and fearful sighs from Channel Ten’s
newsman, Robert Kennedy, who seems
anxious to leave this sartorial frippery
in the Wentworth’s Matilda Room and
engage himself elsewhere with news of
a heavier nature. Actually, Mr. Klein
is asked what he thinks of Mr. Ken-
nedy’s exotic image his entrance is
magnificent the red carnation, red
striped tie, red silk handkerchief worn
with a grey suit, a present from Swedex.
“Dull,” says Mr. Klein. “I say he looks
dull.”
Everyone’s here to see what the young
man of the future will wear, and
whether, as Mr. Klein claims, “Australia
is about to take a dramatic step for-
ward in assuming world leadership in
design and manufacture of fashion-
accented suits for men.” Also to down
the liquor and canapes. Mr. Klein stuffs
a fist in his pocket and reads with
unction from a typewritten sheet. “Car-
naby Street is dead. Oh, it’s still being
headlined to bolster British prestige,
as the Beatles are, but the Carnaby
catalyst in men’s fashion has fizzled out.”
You know, too far out. Gone. But
there’s this youth explosion, someone’s
got to clothe them. If Carnaby Street
can’t, then, by the grace of Daroff, Mr.
Klein will.
Richard appears in a button-four
jacket with open, flared sleeve cuffs and
flared trousers. On his arm is Jan
she has a part in “Casino Royale”
in her own trendy togs. They smile
toothily into zooming cameras, exit
behind the bar. “If you’ve any doubts
about the strength of the youth ex-
plosion,” says Mr. Klein, “let me assure
you that by 1971 48 percent of the
suit market will be under 35 years of
age . . . and 66 percent of suits sold
will be fashion-accented, and oh,
come on do, where’s the next one?
Make a move-on out there . . .” Kim
wanders on, a pale imitation of Avenger
John Steed in a mini Robin Hood hat
escorting another girl called Jan, who
has never been, and nurtures no desire
to be, connected with “Casino Royale.”
Her boyfriend, she says, would love
these clothes, but then his taste is more
advanced than hers. “Casino Royale”
Jan says they’re, all right. Sniff.
Clinton, an Irish ex-matelot, smiles
over his Balmacan collar —it can be
done up to here so or here, so and
thinks, holy mackerel, if the boys could
see him now! Six years on the Royal
yacht Britannia, no less, jaunting around
with the Queen and Philip and Charles
and Anne, it was a drahp of orl roight.
He shoots his cuffs and reveals Britannia
cufflinks. A present from HM? No. A
purchase from the canteen.
A few more natural shoulder jackets
with dramatic lOin. vent, waist sup-
pression, button-four, button-three, and
button-two (with reservations), followed
by four formals with Balmacan collars
and sort of pork-pie hats, and the show
is over. “Look, go on ” urges Channel
Ten’s cameraman, an old King’s boy
(and, says Mr. Kennedy, a fat lot of
good it did him), “you get into one of
those flared things and I’ll film you
with the models.” No fear, Mr. Kennedy
is adamant they wouldn’t fit him,
and he wouldn’t be seen dead in them.
“Oh, go on. You said do something
different.” Certainly not. Mr. Kennedy
is filmed talking rhubarb with “Casino
Royale” Jan and the model done by
“Vogue.” He is a bit put out. He has a
new suit on the stocks with two back
vents like Mr. Klein’s vintage ’65,
dammit.
Mr. Ron Saw, the columnist, wearing
toning tie and handkerchief, he can’t
hear matching, rocks back on size nine
shoes and says, see those flared sleeves,
that Balmacan collar, those flared
pants? Take all that away and you’re
left with a darned good suit, like his.
Mr. Bob Rogers, wearing a passe floral
tie, glares at someone, who butts in on
his conversation with Mr. Klein. And,
by golly, columnist Ray Castle is right:
there is a woman magazine writer
here making notes about his clothes for
another waspish piece. It shouldn’t be
allowed.
Mr. Klein gives a separate show to
retailers on the advice of his pub-
licity man, who says Press and trade
never mix well.

WITH GRAHAM KERR
Seeking a
national identity
in the kitchen
A SEARCH for judges for our Aus-
tralian national cuisine competition took
me last month to the world’s finest
hotels and restaurants. The response
was successful beyond all my hopes,
and when the final total is in there
should be about 30 owners or chefs of
the world’s most famous eating places
on our judging panel.
They will be learning about our
food, so it is interesting to recall what
I learnt last month about theirs. Some
of you might be lucky enough to go
travelling and eat at the same restaur-
ants to put the food, and my
judgment, to the test. Here are some
of the places I visited:
Michel’s, Colony Surf Hotel, Hawaii.
Excellent food, wonderful view—dining-
room opens on to the Waikiki beach.
Good service, table cooking mostly.
Try the frogs’ legs in almonds. Expen-
sive average cost for one person:
$2O (in Australian dollars, as are all
the other prices I mention). Mr. Holt
slept there the hotel, not the restaur-
ant.
Ernie’s, Montgomery Street, San
Francisco. Best food I have eaten in
years. Genuine Barbary Coast atmos-
phere. One of the top nine Five-Star-
Award restaurants for this year. Saddle
of lamb with herb dressing is superb.
Also their melting-soft souffle pancakes.
Expensive average per head $2O,
but worth it.
Royal Orleans Hotel, New Orleans.
Beautiful hotel. Built to look ancient
six years ago. Magnificent roof-top
pool. Rib Room restaurant serves best
beef yet tasted in the U.S.
Brennan’s French Restaurant, New
Orleans. Another of the top nine U.S.
restaurants family operated by
charming people. A house specialty:
Pompano stuffed with shellfish. Also
pancakes, cream cheese, and strawber-
ries flambe. A delightful experience at
$lB a head.
Plantation Restaurant, New Orleans.
About six miles from the city. The
atmosphere—of the old, Deep South —
is tremendous. Singing Negro waiter.
Food excellent especially the fan-
tastic baked crab. Wine list rather
small. Slightly less expensive at $l7 a
person.
The Forum of the 12 Caesars, New
York. Most elaborate presentation, ex-
cellent service. The food varies many
flames but most is impressive. Try
pork cutlets in honey and ginger.
Extremely expensive. $3O a head.
The Tower Suite, New York. Superb
view over Manhattan from top of the
Time-Life Building, in Rockefeller
Center. Your own butler and maid for
the night. Set menu provides two
choices. Don’t go past the roast beef
the best I tasted in the U.S. Reason-
able set menu $9.50, wine extra.
Hotel Americana, New York. Their
chef cLe cuisine, a Swiss, is possibly
America’s No. One. Third-largest hotel
in New York: 2000 rooms. Food and
service very good. Average $l5 a head.
The Savoy Hotel, London. Europe’s
celebrated maitre chef de cuisine,
Silvinio Trompetto, presides over truly
wonderful food. Try Noisettes of Lamb
and the incredible Mousseline of
Lobster Newburg. Atmosphere abso-
lutely 19305. Expensive. Average $l7
a person.
La Belle Terrace, Tivoli Gardens,
Copenhagen. The restaurant for royalty.
The most fabulous decor of all. Service
wonderful, food excellent. Cannot praise
this place too much. Average meal $l5.
The Three Hussars, Vienna. The top
restaurant in Vienna. Redolent with
atmosphere Strauss, the Hapsburgs,
the great past and truly fascinating.
Eat the souffle pancakes with nut cream
and strawberries. Unforget table!
Average prices.
The Four Seasons Hotel, Vienna.
Modern, U.S.-style hotel, with the best
of Viennese good manners. The food
is excellent, and though the locals re-
gard it as for Americans only, it has
Viennese management and food. Inex-
pensive Vienna is a reasonable place
to visit. But don’t send telegrams
they cost three times as much as ours.
Hotel Meurice, Paris. Their maitre
chef de cuisine will be one of the final
judging panel in Sydney in October.
He is unquestionably one of the finest
chefs in Europe and his food was un-
surpassed on my tour. The hotel is
elegant and utterly French, and room
charges range from $l2 to more than
$3O a day. The restaurant isn’t for the
budget travellers $l9 a head.
Maxim’s, Paris. Absolutely magnifi-
cent. A total experience. Ask me what
to eat and I’ll say, “Anything on their
menu it is bound to be superb.”
Average charge: $2O per person.
So far I have judges from 23 very
excellent establishments. I still have to
visit two other Paris judges; then go
to Rome, and finally Hong Kong. With
luck we should finish easily with 30.
As this is the last time I shall write
in The Bulletin about the “Quest
for Australian Cuisine” may I ask you
to exercise your very best creative
talents, using only Australian-grown or
-produced ingredients, and enter.
Unwittingly or not, I have committed
Australia to an international test of pro-
portions beyond my wildest dreams.

Far-away places
with strange-
sounding dames
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
PEREGRINE WORSTHORNE, Tues-
day Weld, and Vandal Carter are not
fictional characters. The first is an
English journalist, the second an
American actress, the third the young
son of an Australian photographer (who
has another son called Goth). These
persons have one thing in common
they illustrate the contemporary appre-
ciation of uncommon names. In the
past, Peregrine Worsthorne might have
hidden his prenomen behind an initial,
as Pelham Wodehouse did. Today he
probably finds it a professional asset.
A symptom of name-consciousness is
the reluctance of parents to abbreviate
children’s names. Mothers used to call
out: “Betty, come inside!” “Chrissie,
it’s bath time!” “Milly, go and do your
practice!” Now they address them with
punctilious formality: “Elizabeth!”
“Christine!”’ “Millicent!” There has
been a wave of double-named girls
Sally Anns and Sue Ellens and Amber
Maes- —who must on no account be
referred to familiarly as Sally, Sue, or
Amber. Boys likewise are Michael,
Richard, and William, not Mike, Dick,
or Bill. A modern Steele Rudd would
have to relate the adventures of Dad
and David.
Connoisseurs of off-beat nomen-
clature have always derived pleasure
from the list of staff members pub-
lished each week by “Time.” This
magazine, when recruiting employees,
appears to give preference to those with
odd appellations. Ray Castle, the Syd-
ney “Telegraph” columnist, lately dis-
covered in the “Time” list a staffer
with the astonishing name of Minnie
Magazine. An executive of the paper
assured him that Miss Magazine existed.
The sonorous roll-call of “Time’s”
research staff used to be headed by
Content Peckham. At a party in
New York in my youth I was intro-
duced to a comely Chilean “Time”
researcher whose first name was Paz.
She told me it was the Spanish word
for “peace.” Our acquaintance did not
develop any further, as Paz made it
clear that she wanted to be left in
paz.
Minnie Magazine goes into my pri-
vate list of supernames, along with Vin-
dictive Jones, Amy Trampleasure, the
bisexual racehorse Lord Cynara, and
the bishop who signed himself Archi-
bald the Arctic. Vindictive Jones was
involved in a court case in Sydney.
When the judge asked how she got
her name, she explained that at the
time of her birth her father had been
a shipyard worker engaged in building
the destroyer Vindictive. I came across
Amy Trampleasure in an English news-
paper, and know nothing of her except
that her name has the power to start
a curious train of thought.
American magazine fiction has done
good work in popularising unfamiliar
names for girls, like Quentin and
Rogerleen. The United Nations, how-
ever unsuccessful in other ways, has
introduced us to the memorable charac-
ters Thakin Nu, Odd Bull, and U Pu.
I have also read, of two Burmese
politicians called U Win and U Won,
both said to be good sports.
Britain provides her share of out-
of-the-way names and uses them, as
might be expected, to indicate class
distinctions. Multiple initials (featured
by amateur cricketers like J. W. H. T.
Douglas) and hyphens are among the
traditional signs of social eminence.
Hyphens, however, have not been the
same since Miss Mandy Rice-Davies
rose to fame. One reason for her un-
doubted popularity was her demonstra-
tion that a girl who had a hyphen could
behave as if she didn’t.
The cultivated English have often
shown enterprise in the choice of names,
a good example being Florence Night-
ingale’s sister Parthenope (born at
Naples and called after the local siren).
A recent letter to “The Times” was
signed Eglantine Jebb. In artistic
Hampstead, male infants are apt to be
christened Tarquin or Quasimodo.
The main thing in dealing with per-
sons who have conspicuous names is
to ignore the fact. Sir Alec Guinness
has complained, with justification, of
the number of wags who link him with
stout. His grievance is echoed by
numerous Seales, Hoggs, Ramsbothams,
etc.
I like to imagine giving a party
where I would introduce exotically
named guests with consumate poise:
“Peregrine Worsthorne, this is Amy
Trampleasure.”
“Eglantine Jebb, U Pu.”
“I beg your pardon!”
“Odd Bull, please meet Vindictive
Jones.”
“Tuesday Weld, this is Saturday
Knight.”
“Minnie Magazine, Thakin Nu.”
“Thanking you, Mr. Campbell.”

WEEK
Sense of identity
LEADER of the Opposition, Gough
Whitlam, as well as plucking victory,
gathered up this anecdote from the
Corio by-election. Two women ap-
proached Senator Sam Cohen, said they
recognised him from television, and
asked who was the tall man they’d
seen with him a few moments before.
“That,” said Senator Cohen, “was Mr.
Whitlam.” “Fancy,” said one of the
women, “who is Mr. Whitlam?”
Whitlam said it reminded him of the
time Sir Robert Menzies called on Sir
Garfield Barwick to offer him a certain
appointment. “Who,” said Sir Garfield’s
secretary, “shall I say is calling?”
Do it yourself
THE POST OFFICE seems delighted
that about 40 percent of letters are
already bearing postcode numbers.
However, we can see some areas for
improvement. We have just had a letter
from the Commonwealth Government
Public Relations Office in Canberra
asking us to let them know our postcode
number. Now if someone will only tell
them to go around to their nearest post
office, pick up a booklet, and look up
their own postcode numbers, as every-
one else is doing, then soon those vast
quantities of handouts, important and
unimportant, which pour out from Gov-
ernment departments will be postcoded,
lifting the Post Office’s 40 percent quite
a bit.
From all sides
“THE OPERA HOUSE AFFAIR” by
The Bulletin’s financial editor,
Michael Baume, was published by
Nelson this week. Mr. Baume, tackling
the first full-scale account of what has
happened on Bennelong Point, intended
to leave it to readers to apportion praise
or blame.
However, he has already found that
people are perfectly willing to read into
his book what they wish: some of the
pro-Utzon faction are accepting it as a
presentation of the case for the archi-
tect, while others are taking it as an
apologia for Minister for Local Gov-
ernment Davis Hughes.
Heavenly music
NICANOR ZABALETA is a genial,
talkative man who belies any idea one
might have had about the ethereal
nature of harpists. He is Spanish, grey-
haired, short, though powerfully built,
an ex-Soccer player who is delighted
with Australian beer. If he hadn’t
decided to make the intricacies of the
harp a life-time study, he thinks he
might have been an engineer.
“There is a great affinity between
mathematics and music,” he said.
“Everywhere I have gone I have found
that doctors have the greatest apprecia-
tion of music. And writers have the
least especially those who write
essays or novels. Poets have some inter-
est. But you know who I think have
been my best audience the copper
miners in Chile.”
But life has not been all appreciation
for Mr. Zabaleta since his father bought
him his first harp when he was seven
years old. It has also been a long
struggle to convince people that the
harp has a place as a solo instrument.
But now, with the help of young con-
temporary composers and, surprisingly,
the influence of King David, of the Old
Testament, Mr. Zabaleta thinks the
battle is being won.
“Because of David, Israel has adopted
the harp as its national instrument, and
every three years international com-
petitions are held there. The fourth one
is -scheduled for next year. As well,
many of the avant garde composers are
writing for the harp because of its
special richness and its color and
variety.”
Mr. Zabaleta and his number one
harp (six feet tall and weighing 901 b.)
are in Australia for a series of concerts
taking in every State but Western Aus-
tralia. It is an energetically average
kind of schedule for Mr. Zabaleta, who
travels 30,000 miles a year.
Some years ago, his career well estab-
lished, Mr. Zabaleta made an experi-
ment. He added an extra pedal to the
orthodox seven-pedal harp.
“It took a lot of adjustment and at
first it was very difficult, but it has
succeeded. The eighth pedal cuts the
vibrations.” It also employs more effort.
“Yes, it is a tiring instrument to play.
But I manage ... I do my seven hours
a day.”
No more stripping
STRIPPED FURNITURE has been
very much in fashion for the past few
years; everything from pine to cedar,
from kitchen-chair to sideboard, from
heavy Jacobean to fussy Victorian, has
been denuded of its layers of varnish
and paint to fetch high prices in bric-
a-brac shops. The bare look is still
fashionable, but stripping is out.
Scrubbing is now the word.
Helen Gill, who sells scrubbed fur-
niture in a shop called Wood and Wares,
just opened in Kensington, Sydney, says
scrubbing is the best way to describe
what her process is. “We immerse the
furniture in our own special prepara-
tion, then take it out and scrub all the
old finish off,” she said. “I get so sick
of people coming in and asking me
how to strip,” she added with a ghost
of a smile.
Scrubbed-furniture dealers are sec-
retive about their formulas for remov-
ing paint. “It’s a matter of experiment,”
one said. “Neutralisers are important
and we use different things for each
woodgrain. Oak is the hardest to strip,
the pores in the wood are so deep.”
The bare look appeals particularly
to people who want to furnish cheaply.
Heavy furniture is cut down to fit
modern flats and homes. Old-fashioned
roll-top desks are highly sought after
and sell for $lOO.
Amateurs longing to do their own
scrubbing should quell their ' urges.
Amateur recipes for stripping furniture
include caustic soda, carbolic acid,
ammonia, and peroxide, all of which
can burn furniture, to say nothing of
skin.
Scrubbed furniture is likely to stay
in vogue for some time, until, in fact,
some manufacturer opens his eyes to
the market and begins manufacturing
some reasonably priced furniture with
simple lines in a wood which takes a
waxed finish well.

MICHAEL BAUME WRITES OK
THE
ECONOMY
A "do nothing"
Budget could
be just right
TWO THINGS ARE definitely not
needed on Tuesday week. One of them
is a tough, restrictive Budget; the other
is an expansionist one. Right now we
need a Budget that does nothing. At
last, the basic creed of the present
Government has the chance of express-
ing itself in an appropriate way.
For “do nothing” is not just an easy
way out; it is a conscious policy. It
means allowing the economy to con-
tinue to move forward out of the 1966
“mini-recession” (which is far from
over; have a look at the unemployment
figures, or house building, or the appli-
ance industry) at a reasonable rate
without encouraging excessive optimism
and at the same time without dis-
couraging the sort of mildly optimistic
view of the future that is vital if com-
panies are to spend money on develop-
ment.
At present, monetary policy is quite
properly in “neutral,” with the authori-
ties having made credit a little less
easy than earlier in the year but not
having set out to restrict it to any
serious degree. It would be damaging
to do so at the moment. The time for
restraint may come later; it has not
come yet. This means that the
Treasurer should not try to skim money
out of the private sector in the Budget,
but instead should leave it to the
Reserve Bank to apply the monetary
brakes if and when they are needed.
And right now the bank has so much
room to manoeuvre that Budget action
is quite unnecessary.
Let’s face it; this country is capable
of achieving a lot more than it is doing
now without creating the inflationary
demand pressures that caused so much
trouble in 1960. That boom was the
result of excessive pressure on resources;
we’ve got a long way to go before that
sort of situation exists again. The con-
trast between then and now is stagger-
ing. Look at employment. In those days
there was overfull employment and
overtime payments were immense. It
was these overtime payments that
prompted so much spending on cars
and washing-machines and refrigerators
and so on. Well, there is nothing like
the overtime being earned now. In fact,
there is quite the opposite, as the
unemployment situation seems to be
getting a bit worse, if anything, with
1.6 percent of the workforce at present
registered, and with probably as many
again not in jobs but not registered.
Of course, there are cost rises now
mounting in the economy, but these
have nothing to do with pressure on
scarce resources. They are the result of
decisions to raise wages or to raise State
•charges and taxes; they are the direct
result of official measures. They are
officially made cost inflation, not pri-
vately made demand inflation, and these
are two very different things that call
for very different treatment.
People still seem to be keener on
saving their money than spending it.
There seems to have been a lot of
“once-and-for-all” spending in the 1960
boom, when people bought their first
car, their first television set, and their
first washing-machine. Nowadays, these
markets look to be largely replacement
ones. There simply is not scope for the
sort of rush into consumer durables that
featured in the 1960 boom and that
triggered off the huge bout of private
capital investment as it filtered up
through to the capital goods sector of
the economy. Right now we are so far
from being in a boom situation that it
is not funny.
In recent times, the rate of private
capital expenditure on new plant and
equipment and buildings has been
“modest,” and official policy seems
aimed at its continuing that way. It has
been so modest that the building in-
dustry, for example, is operating at
well below its capacity (certainly in the
housing field there seems to be, if any-
thing, something of a slackening of
demand in recent months). And judg-
ing by the large amount of BHP’s extra
steel production that it had to export
in order to sell, it seems that the
demand for basic materials in Aus-
tralia is not doing anything more than
rising very modestly also.
There have certainly been no exces-
sive demand pressures on resources
like money or imports. Back in the
1960 boom days, the demand for
money was such that everyone was fall-
ing over himself to expand produc-
tive capacity as the boom looked like
lasting for ever. But things are very
different indeed these days. There are
large areas of unused capacity in Aus-
tralian industry and it will take a
long time before demand gets anywhere
near the levels that would prompt these
industries to even think about expand-
ing again. There is plenty of money
around now without its prompting any
run-away demand pressures. So there
are unlikely to be any bad effects on
demand as we run into that period of
the year when there is a seasonal in-
crease in the amount of cash available.
September to December is that time
of the year when companies that have
expansion plans in mind usually pour
into the capital market to raise what
they can while the going is good. Well,
there is no evidence of any flood likely
to come this year; certainly nothing
like the remarkable rush of 1964, for
example. For companies with sensible
expansion plans have in general found
there is plenty of cash available for
them; there is no backlog of expansion
plans simply waiting for an improve-
ment in the supply of credit. Thus the
risks of a runaway rise in spending on
expansion are not serious enough to
worry about at the moment.
There can be no doubt about the
preference people have at present for
saving instead of spending. Last week’s
announcement of a 10 percent jump in
savings bank deposits during 1966-67
(or almost double the increase in retail
sales during the year) shows that only
too clearly. And with no real backlog
of demand, there is unlikely to be any
rush to spend these savings.
There are no balance of payments
reasons for a tough Budget. Imports
look to be in a safe enough state, with
the latest financial year ending up in a
reasonable position despite some drain
on foreign reserves, and with the year
that has just started certain to be a
lot better. For not only have imports
been slow to rise in response to the
modest rises in consumer demand, but
exports are sure to rise considerably
this year, helped by the huge jump in
shipments of metals and ores resulting
from the massive developmental pro-
jects that are now becoming a com-
monplace in Australia.
These mounting exports mean that
we will be able to sustain a far faster
rate of growth than in the past two
years without placing undue strains on
our balance of payments; in other
words, we will have earned the cash,
so we may as well spend it on growing
into a bigger and better country.
Of course, there are those who think
that the Government should take a more
positive approach to the economy in its
coming Budget. J. C. Horsfall, who says
on page 44 that “At the very least there
should be a tough Budget,” is one of
them. What actually is going to
happen? Our Canberra bureau thinks
that the Government might even ginger
the economy along a bit (see page 17).
But there seems no need to do this by
any direct means. All the Government
needs do is insist that a larger propor-
tion of the defence vote be spent in
Australia than has been the case in
the past two years; that would harden
up some of the more noticeable soft
spots in no time. And already there are
signs that this may happen, with the
new Army trucks order being one
example and with the electronics com-
panies indicating that their defence
orders seem to be picking up a bit.

AS I SEE IT
In a word —or two —
respectability the
Whitlam way
By ALAN REID
OPPOSITION LEADER Gough Whit-
lam is trying to get at this week’s
meeting of the Federal ALP conference
a formula of words that will give Labor
electoral respectability in the foreign
affairs field, and himself real prospects
of winning the Prime Ministership in
1969.
This is good sense. If the 1966 gen-
eral elections which saw Labor crush-
ingly defeated were decided, as I for
one believe they were, by the over-
whelming desire of Australian voters to
maintain and tighten the United States-
Australia alliance, Whitlam has to
remove the suspicion that a strong and
effective section of the Labor Party is
not only against the alliance but work-
ing vigorously to secure its repudiation.
Whitlam has shown a considerable
subtlety in approaching his task. He
has not come out with such a declara-
tion as “all the way with LBJ” with
which Prime Minister Harold Holt
symbolised the dedication of his
Liberal-Country Party Coalition Gov-
ernment to maintenance of the Aus-
tralia-U.S. alliance.
To have done so would have pro-
duced a public hostile reaction from
that section of the Labor Party which,
whatever the consequences politically
for the ALP, is not prepared to modify
.its anti-United States attitude.
So instead, Whitlam seized upon the
issue of Australia’s involvement in
Vietnam which (if you leave out of
consideration the question whether Aus-
tralia’s interests are even more deeply
involved there than those of the United
States) can in a sense be regarded as
a by-product of the United States-Aus-
tralia alliance.
Whitlam wanted a word formula
that would remove the simple proposi-
tion that with the election of an Aus-
tralian Labor Government, all Aus-
tralian troops would be withdrawn from
Vietnam an action which clearly
would have the effect of damaging,
possibly irretrievably, the United States-
Australia alliance, something the Aus-
tralian people, by their vote at the last
general elections, rejected as unthink-
able.
At the time this is being written,
the ALP Federal Conference Labor’s
supreme policy-making body is meet-
ing in Adelaide. It has not yet made
its decisions on foreign policy. But my
feeling is that Whitlam will get the
change in words he seeks.
This feeling is based on the fact that
the conference will make its decisions
on the recommendations of the ALP
Foreign Affairs Committee.
This committee numbers seven. Two
of the seven—N.S.W. ALP President
C. T. (“Charley”) Oliver and Senator
Tony Mulvihill, N.S.W. are Whit-
lam supporters. The other five Dr.
Jim Cairns, Vic., the Deputy Senate
Leader, Senator Sam Cohen, Mr. Tom
Uren, N.S.W., Senator John Wheeldon,
W.A., and Senator James Cavanagh,
W.A. —are much more interested in
ending the Australian involvement in
Vietnam than in furthering Whitlam’s
ambitions either for the Party or for
himself. They were the people with
votes on this committee, although Whit-
lam, the ALP Federal Secretary, Mr.
C. S. Wyndham, and the Chairman of
the Caucus Foreign Affairs and De-
fence Committee, Mr. Kim Beazley,
were present in a non-voting role during
the committee’s discussions on how
Labor’s foreign policy should be
worded.
Despite their voting superiority, the
five agreed to a rewording of the ALP
policy on Vietnam which produced
such disastrous results in 1966.
Their motives were probably mixed.
There was the question of self-survival.
If Labor went down much further
electorally, they might find themselves
among the casualties.
Then there was the chance of get-
ting into government (and all poli-
ticians see themselves as potential
ministers). If an exercise in semantics
would improve that chance, why not
indulge in the exercise?
But it is only fair to them to say that
Gough Whitlam... subtle approach
they regarded it as an exercise in sem-
antics. They did not see the change in
wording as changing basic Labor policy.
They would still be in a position to
work for and advocate the ending of
Australian participation in Vietnam.
But they would be spared the necessity
of saying how their objective would be
achieved. The wording could mean all
things to all men. It could be left for
whichever was the dominant group
when Labor achieved power to decide
how the ending of Australia’s partici-
pation could and should be achieved.
Even when he gets this change in
phraseology and can do something
effective with it electorally, Whitlam
still has his problems real problems.
Without comment, I let the following
facts speak for themselves.
Dr. Jim Cairns, who has been in the
United States publicly campaigning
against the Vietnam policy of President
Johnson (a policy which is supported
by the Republicans and hence likely to
be the policy of any future United
States administration, Republican or
Democratic), was elected top of the
poll for the Victorian ALP Executive.
Cairns was also the runner-up to Whit-
lam when Whitlam won the Caucus
vote for Labor leadership last February.
This puts Cairns in the position of being
No. 1 man on the Victorian ALP Ex-
ecutive and a sufficient power in Caucus
to ensure that he is at least No. 3 man
in a future Whitlam Government.
Of the Victorian ALP Executive,
which supports and is supported by
Cairns, Whitlam has stated publicly,
with precision, and deliberately: “The
present (Victorian) Executive includes
an influential handful of men who have
flouted ALP policy on unity tickets in
the spirit, if not the letter, of the rule,
who have organised or led political
strikes in defiance of the ACTU, who
have disregarded, and indeed repudi-
ated, ALP and ACTU policy on the
manning of ships to Vietnam, who have
organised demonstrations against the
Trades Hall Council Executive in this
very chamber. It is disgraceful that
these men should be on an ALP Execu-
tive which can appear to influence
Federal policies and selections.”
As I see it, irrespective of what verbal
advances Whitlam makes during the
present conference, if he does nothing
about the Victorian Executive (or con-
verts Cairns to his view of the Vic-
torian Executive) they will be verbal
rather than actual advances.
He will still have the problem of
explaining how he is going to reconcile
the fact that the man who is un-
doubtedly now after the vote he got
from the Victorian Executive the
most influential man on that Executive
(which Whitlam has condemned in
tougher terms than any I have ever
used) must become at least the No. 3
man in any Government he forms, and
a power in the land.
It will be interesting to see whether
Whitlam secures that reconciliation by
semantics, conversion, or action.


AUSTRALIA
Planning toward a $7 billion
Budget with ginger in it
IN THESE DAYS of big Government
and growing defence, Budgets are never
soft. But by all indications the forth-
coming one shouldn’t be particularly
tough.
It is not that the Commonwealth
Government outlays are being re-
strained with any great success, but
that the economy as a whole is judged
capable of taking some extra strain. The
labor situation is pretty soft, to use the
words of a Treasury official. They won’t
put it in this language, but it is plain
to outside observers that unemploy-
ment is quite high, at least in terms
of modern full employment economy.
It is almost twice as high as in 1965.
And despite reasonable liveliness in the
economy this year, unemployment has
been tending to creep upwards.
“The economy can do with a bit
more ginger,” said a Treasury man.
And that alone is enough to guarantee
that there won’t be any major set of
tax increases.
The Government wants to encourage
personal spending to keep on rising at
recent rates, so it doesn’t want to
reduce personal spending power. In
fact, the weight of its own expendi-
tures is bound to expand incomes and
spending.
Defence and Foreign Aid was first
on the agenda in Cabinet’s Budget
meetings, as it has been for the past
three years. This placing has a certain
significance in itself, but Cabinet Min-
isters readily agreed that it was another
Budget with Defence getting top
priority.
We reported last week that a figure
of around slloom. had been de-
termined for Defence spending, but it
now appears that it will be somewhat
higher than this.
The publication of the British White
Paper had some last-minute impact on
the Defence vote. There are suggestions
that provisions for commitment to
Malaysia and Singapore may have been
enlarged.
Sooner or later the Government is
going to be forced by the pressures of
military commitments and alliances
into expanding our Army beyond nine
battalions, since these provide only four
thousand combat troops for action over-
seas. The Army in its submission to
Cabinet asked for an increase of several
thousand in the overall recruiting
target, but this was rejected for the
time being. A decision will now prob-
ably be left until after the Senate elec-
tions.
The Treasury is hopeful of getting
up to slom. a year quite soon from
UN agencies for New Guinea develop-
ment. But this will be on the under-
standing that our own expenditure
growth is not curtailed. There should
be ssm. in the Budget for Indonesian
aid, a sum which looks poor beside
the Japanese s6om. and the West Ger-
man $25m., but is big by comparison
with what has been done in the past.
India, of course, has been given s9m.
John McEwen ... helpful raise
worth of wheat, and defence aid to
Malaysia and Singapore should be about
slom.
Defence and aid expenditure together
should rise s2som. on last year’s
sloBom.
Payments to the States are likely to
increase by just as large an amount:
say s27om. on $2200m.
Social Services inevitably get lower
priority than in the years before the
Defence build-up, though there may be
some small concessions—for instance,
further liberalisation of the means test,
and an increase in eligibility regulations.
With wages and prices having risen
considerably during the year, it would
be surprising, however, if there was no
increase in pension scales.
Subsidies shouldn’t cost more than
last year with wheat prices strong, but
Mr. McEwen has been pressing for a
helpful raise in aid to the sugar indus-
try, and dairying may get more money.
PMG capital expenditure is destined
to soar again, but the Treasury intends
that this money should be found in the
higher charges it hopes to get through
Parliament this time.
Expenditure on airports is rising
massively, and the Treasurer is particu-
larly worried about the costs of these.
There is a good deal of talk about shift-
ing more of these costs on to air
travellers. Eventually, the construction
and operation of airports is going to be
handed over to an Airports authority,
which will attempt to recoup its costs.
For the moment, the Government will
do no more than raise its air navigation
charges to the airlines.
The running expenses of Departments
are certain to rise again, though
Treasury officials say Mr. McMahon
has been raising hell about the growth
of the Public Service. “He’s ranting
about it every other day. And he’s been
talking to some people here in the
Treasury, too. But, of course, every other
John McMahon ... raising hell
Minister thinks he hasn’t got enough
people, and so the Treasurer is left as
the only man really fighting for
restraint.”
About the only savings on the public
purse are the end of the decimal cur-
rency changeover and the tailing off of
the Snowy scheme. In total the Budget
will be heading toward the $7 billion
mark from last year’s $6 billion.
Cambodia
The freeze
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT
has, in the past several years, been very
proud of its “special relationship” with
Cambodia. The fact that a country
which constantly proclaimed China its


“number one friend” could also be kept
on excellent terms with Australia,
despite our close relations with South
Vietnam, Thailand, and the U.S. (Cam-
bodia’s “number one enemies”), was
often displayed as evidence of our flexi-
bility and diplomatic skill.
Australian-Cambodian relations
reached their high point with the visit
of Prime Minister Holt to Phnom Penh
at the end of March. Speaking of the
virtues of agreeing to disagree and
remaining good friends while following
different policies, Mr. Holt also signifi-
cantly referred to “recognition of the
territorial integrity” of the countries of
the region.
For recognition of Cambodia’s boun-
daries and sovereignty has been one of
Prince Sihanouk’s continuing pre-
occupations over the years. He claims
small parts of the present territory of
each of his neighbors—Thailand, Laos,
and South Vietnam and has often
alleged plots, CIA inspired, to over-
throw his regime... Sihanouk started a
diplomatic campaign in 1964 to get Viet
Cong recognition of his borders. Prior
to the 1954 Geneva ceasefire the Viet
Minh occupied several provinces of
South-east Cambodia, and their Com-
munist successors have used these areas
Prince Sihanouk ... end of road?
extensively as sanctuaries for assaults
into South Vietnam.
In May, Cambodia called on every
Government which wished to maintain
diplomatic relations with her to declare
their recognition of the frontiers. France,
East Germany, and Singapore had
already done so. The Soviet Union
quickly obliged, followed rather grudg-
ingly by China, North Vietnam, and the
Viet Cong, with Australia coming in
next.
External Affairs officials insist that
our statement of “respect” for the
“territorial integrity” of Cambodia was
discussed with the Foreign Minister and
accepted by him before it was released.
Certainly Sihanouk himself subsequently
welcomed the statement.
But then last week he evidently had
second thoughts and complained that
our statement of “respect” was not
enough. He wanted “recognition,” and
if he didn’t get it he would “freeze
diplomatic relations with Australia.”
This piece of diplomatic language was
taken to mean that the Cambodian
Ambassador in Canberra would be with-
drawn, our man in Phnom Penh would
be allowed to stay, but he would be
treated “coldly” by the Cambodian
Government.
In Canberra there was puzzlement
about why Australia should be singled
out for such remonstrations. After all,
even number one friends like France,
U.S.S.R., China, and North Vietnam
used the term “respect,” not “recogni-
tion.” Was it the corollary to our state-
ment which said explicitly that we did
not support any particular delineation
of the frontiers? If so, why did he
accept it in the first place, or why
didn’t he complain specifically about
that?
Maybe he was trying to frighten the
British and the Indians into harder
statements? Maybe, having quarrelled
a little lately with the Chinese, he was
indirectly affirming his continued
attachment to so-called “positive
neutralism.”
In any case, the Australian Govern-
ment is not likely to make any compro-
mises. It does not wish to risk affront-
ing Thailand and South Vietnam. It
intends to sit tight. “Yes, we may be at
the end of the road. That is now for
Sihanouk to decide,” was one official’s
summary of the present situation.
Tariffs
A benchmark?
THE TARIFF DEBATE received
another fillip last week when Dr. Max
Corden, Australia’s leading trade
scholar, weighed in, with an address in
Adelaide.
He was careful to avoid being
identified with any of the groups which
have so far spoken. He had some
criticism for each, though he gave
qualified support to suggestions from
the Tariff Board that there should be
moves toward a benchmark tariff rate.
He came out in favor of the heavy,
protection afforded the motor-vehicle
industry, even though he commented
that it had something of “the mystic
role of the steel industries in some
underdeveloped countries.”
Protection for chemicals was, he
thought, indefensible because the in-
dustry simply shows few prospects of
being able to survive with moderate
tariffs. Present tariffs are prohibitive,
virtually equivalent to import restric-
tions.
There will be a great deal of applause
among the rural community and in
the Liberal Party for his suggestion
that the Tariff Board be made respon-
sible to the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment rather than to Mr. McEwen’s
Department of Trade and Industry.
“The Department of Trade and
Industry sees itself as primarily con-
cerned with the interests of secondary
industry. But tariff policy is more a
matter of adjudicating between tariff
applicants on the one hand and con-
sumers and industries on the other.”
Feeder airlines
Turbulence
IT WAS A NORMAL, busy week for
Civil Aviation Minister Swartz, the man
in ultimate charge of Australia’s rapidly
expanding aviation network, arbiter
and sometimes scapegoat for the prob-
lems which accompany fast expansion.
Mr. Swartz surfaced briefly during the
week to fly into Tullamarine in the
first jet to land there, strike a jocular
Air Minister Swartz ... surfacing
pose for the news cameramen, and issue
another statement intended to reassure
Sydneysiders that the jetport at Mascot
would continue to be Australia’s No. 1
landing spot for international jet air-
craft.
Below the surface, and in an even
busier environment, officials of his
department were still sifting applica-
tions for those third-level airline
licences the Minister had announced
weeks ago as “coming soon.” The plan
was to bring into being a new network
of mini-airlines run by smaller-time air
companies with the aircraft and experi-
ence to offer feeder services throughout


inland Australia. So far there have been
something like 28 applications, and after
some weeks only three licences have
been granted. Turbulence, somewhere,
is evident.
The main problem appears to be that
too many have applied to serve much
the same, more heavily populated areas
—the Riverina in N.S.W., for instance—
and too few want to pioneer in the out-
back. The allocations so far point to
this. The first two were in South Aus-
tralia, offering links between Adelaide
and northern areas of the State. Port
Augusta Air Services (PAGAS)
began with a single-engined Piper
Cherokee Six and a thrice-weekly ser-
vice linking Augusta, Pirie, and
Adelaide, with plans to increase to daily
services when possible.
The second, Opal Air, will use an
eight-seat, twin-engined Cessna 402 to
run three services a week between
Adelaide and the opal fields at Coober
Pedy and Andamooka. Australia’s third
(and the first in either Queensland or
N.S.W.) feeder air service is being flown
by Eastern Air Navigation, offering six
flights a week between Brisbane and
Casino, northern N.S.W., using a five-
seat Piper Aztec.
During the month the head of the
Piper Aircraft Corporation of America,
Howard Piper, visited Australia on a
“routine inspection tour” which took
him to many parts of Australia, where
his aircraft are likely to be flown by the
new feeder airlines as well as the long-
standing charter companies.
One of Piper’s touchdowns was in
Western Australia where, strangely,
there have been no applications for the
feeder services, although four W.A.
companies were known to be interested
in the idea. One of them, Murchison
Air Charter, had a Press advertising
campaign about 18 months ago for the
right to operate such a service.
Apparently there are unattractive
aspects of Mr. Swartz’s plan, perhaps
not limited to the more obvious ones
(fixed timetables and no right to switch
aircraft according to passengers offering
for any one flight), but what they might
be neither he nor DCA is saying.
Propaganda
Burchett back?
THE COMMUNIST JOURNALIST
Wilfred Burchett has reapplied for
permission to return to Australia. The
latest application was made to Harold
Holt personally when he was visiting
Cambodia in April.
The Government is at present re-
considering the case and some officials
are reported to be in favor of allowing
the three children of Burchett’s second
marriage to enter Australia and of
granting them Australian citizenship.
Burchett’s Australian passport was
declared invalid in 1955, presumably
for his role in the Korean war. In a
recent issue of the American magazine
“The Reporter,” Australian journalist
Denis Warner records that Burchett was
one of the first correspondents to spread
the lie that the United States was
using germ warfare in Korea. “. . .
Burchett wrote indignantly about the
hideous epidemic the Americans brought
to North Korea. When it became appar-
ent that there was no epidemic he
joined with five other Communist news-
papermen to issue a joint statement that
there was no epidemic because of
efficient Chinese and North Korean
medical precautions.”
Warner reports that in 1952 Burchett
wrote that the Communist prison camps
looked like holiday resorts in Switzer-
land: “The atmosphere is also nearer
that of a luxury holiday resort than a
POW camp.” Warner also records the
charge of an American corporal that
Burchett stood outside a prison camp
and shouted insults at hungry Ameri-
cans.
In 1953 the British Ministry of De-
fence accused Burchett of having
actively engaged in brainwashing pro-
cedures in prisoner-of-war camps.
Prisoners who had “confessed” to using
bacteriological warfare later named him
as one of their interrogators. Warner
Wilfred Burchett. .. accused
adds that a team of Australian investi-
gators subsequently obtained affidavits
from prisoners who had been interro-
gated by Burchett.
In Warner’s opinion the Menzies
Government’s revision of the Crimes
Act was carried out to cover the case
of Burchett, who could probably defeat
a charge of treason because both the
Korean and Vietnam wars are unde-
clared.
If Burchett returns, any campaign
by the Left to promote him and his
books would be matched by the cam-
paign of those who want to have him
tried for treason, or the nearest legal
equivalent.
Science
Fields or labs.
MORE THAN A year ago, to smooth
the long and uncertain path leading
from lab science to field application a
fund was formed which would escalate
rapidly toward $6 million a year.
This financial support program is
known as the Commonwealth Extension
Services Grant. It includes the old
Dairy Industry Extension Grant of
$700,000 and an odd sum of $lOO,OOO
which was also made available each
year for certain research projects in
minor agricultural industries, as ginger
and honey production. With the new
transfusion there would have been
almost $3 million in the CESG for the
financial year 1966-67.
That extension is highly rewarding
is attested by the achievements of farm
club advisors and private agricultural
consultants. A club consists of up to 40
district farmers who contribute a yearly
fee of between $2OO and $4OO to hire an
agricultural scientist as a full-time
advisor. The consultants are similarly
qualified, but not attached to a club,
and operate like vets, doctors, or
lawyers.
In reviewing the growth of these
self-service systems of extension, Mr.
Huon Hassal has reported to the Aus-
tralian Institute of Agricultural Science
that he and his colleagues have in-
creased the net farm income of their
clients by more than 200 percent over
a five-year period.
Some have even achieved this
phenomenal increase in two or three
years. Small wonder that while there
were only eight clubs and two consul-
tants in Australia in 1960, latest figures
show there are now 82 clubs and 29
private consultants. Fewer clubs, more
consultants will be the future pattern
of growth according to Hassal.
Meanwhile, the Victorian Depart-
ment of Agriculture has just announced
the opening of a new Plant Research
Laboratory at Mildura. The $15,000
for its pathology department has been
contributed by the CESG. This is the
first public disclosure of expenditure
of this kind from the Grant.
Although the amount apparently
filched for the further advancement of
test-tube knowledge is small, it may be
a straw in the wind.
Hassal says the main problems facing
the club advisors and private con-
sultants is the need for proper initial
training and the availability of re-
fresher courses. Clearly, support from
the CESG could solve his difficulties
and at the same time discharge the
function that Cabinet seemed to have
in mind. Myxomatosis, which might be
taken as an example of one of the
juicier fruits of science, even at the
height of its rampage, did not come
near to doubling farm profits.

Victoria
Little brother
WHILE FEDERAL CABINET was
shaping its Budget in Canberra last
week, Victorian Liberals were looking
back to the annual preliminary, the
Loan Council, and condemning its
effect on State finances.
The occasion was the Victorian
Party’s State council meeting, and
after an anti-hanging motion had been
defeated, next up was one calling for
an independent commission to investi-
gate Commonwealth-States financial
relationships, to ensure that responsible
government should exist at both levels
within the framework of an effective
Commonwealth system.
The chief speaker for the resolution
was Mr. Brian Dixon, MLA, who said
that “State finances are the most im-
portant domestic problem in Australia
today.” He claimed that every field
of State policy and administration was
at present being controlled by the Com-
monwealth Government through a
financial back door.
Dixon has for some time been work-
ing through various levels of the Party
to sharpen concern for the anomalous
position of States’ finances. A measure
of his success was visible in the support-
ing speech of Mr. Hunt, MLC, who
said the Commonwealth had placed the
Federal system in jeopardy: “We in
the State Parliament bitterly resented
what happened in the last Loan
Council, and we would hate to think
of the position with Labor in power.
“Each yaar,” he added, in his leader’s
absence, “we have the ritual of Sir
Henry Bolte going through histrionics
trying to get more passed down from
Big Brother in Canberra.” The council
voted unanimously for the independent
Commission.
Western Australia
Juveniles problem
A JUVENILE COURT system so
lenient that it breeds only contempt for
the law is cited in the latest issue of
the Western Australian Teachers’
Journal as one of the main reasons for
the State’s high proportion of young
prisoners among a relatively big jail
population. The editorial points to the
case of a country schoolboy, twice con-
victed of stealing within a month, com-
mitted to Child Welfare with a recom-
mendation that he be placed in an
institution and twice allowed to return
to school after a few days.
“Under the present procedures,
reformation is neither possible nor
expected,” say the teachers, who com-
plain also of the disciplinary problems
created by determined rebels returning
to school. And while the Education
Department pointed out that teachers
were empowered to discipline with six
of the best, no real answer to the
problem was forthcoming from the
Minister for Child Welfare, Mr. Les
Logan.
He says reformatories are not the
answer, but fails to suggest what that
is. He gave the weakest of assurances
in saying that most of last year’s 3000
juvenile offenders would never reach
jail and that three-quarters of the
children who passed through the maxi-
mum security institution (with a
capacity of only 33) “do not offend
again while in the Department’s care.”
As with most of the problems in the
fast-developing West, Mr. Logan
acknowledged that it all boiled down
to money; accommodation for 800 chil-
dren would be needed to build institu-
tions even for third-time offenders.
“The financial impossibility for such a
program is immediately obvious—
unless, of course, the Teachers’ Union
is prepared to forgo high schools in
favor of reformatories.”
But, as the teachers point out,
juvenile offenders who can flout the law
at 17 are readily jailed for similar
offences at 18. So in the long term, on
Mr. Logan’s logic, high schools might
need to be sacrificed to build not
reformatories but jails.


New Zealand
Conzinc vs. tuatara
A REPORT BY a Government scien-
tific team that there may be up to 30
million tons of copper-bearing deposits
on Coppermine Island worth more than
SN.Z. 110 million brought a response
from international mining interests . . .
Conzinc Riotintq of Australia, Texas
Gulf of the United States, Mclntyre of
Canada, and Mitsui and Mitsubishi of
Japan.
However, because it made applica-
tion nearly two years ago for a mineral
prospecting warrant on the island, the
Australian firm may be first on the
field. Conzinc Riotinto’s original appli-
cation was deferred because conserva-
tionists protested about damage to fauna
and flora on the 175-acre island, 607
feet above sea-level at its highest point.
It has 150 species of plants, and no
imported animal life such as cats or
rats.
Coppermine is one in the Hen and
Chickens group, off Whangarei, near
the top of the North Island. The Gov-
ernment has made two surveys of the
Minister Talboys ... further checks
island and the N.Z. Minister of Science,
Mr. Talhoys, says deposits are of the
same order of the smaller economic
copper deposits being worked in Aus-
tralia and others currently being pros-
pected by mining companies.
. . ,
The Government scientists reported
that the average grade of the deposits
on the island is about 0.5 percent, that
500,000 tons of such deposits are almost
certainly present eight million tons
probably, and 30 million tons maybe.
- iii - , - r
And also included in the scientific
report was this: Coppermine Island
appears to be the most promising
copper prospect in New Zealand. It
is the only disseminated copper body
yet found here, and this group of
deposits is becoming the most impor-
tant throughout the world. There is at
Tuatara. .. sole survivor
present widespread interest in mining
low-grade copper deposits in all parts
of the world.”
Mr. Talboys says there is a need
for further prospecting to determine
the economic proposition, but the Gov-
ernment has neither the experience,
the equipment, nor the knowledge for
further checks now necessary.
Conzinc Riotinto’s chairman, Sir
Maurice Mawby, says if his company
gets the go-ahead a survey would take
a few months and the project could lie
under way in about two years. Pro-
cessing the ore would be done on the
island with a smelter at Whanarei.
Before deciding on a thorough com-
mercial investigation of Coppermine
Island, the Government wants comment
from the Nature Conservation Council
and the Fauna Protection Advisory
Council, both of which now have copies
of the surveys made.
Any grant of a mineral prospecting
warrant has to be made by the Minister
of Mines and the Minister of Lands on
the recommendation of the Commis-
sioner of Crown Lands. The Minister of
Mines, Mr. Shand, has said that if
deposits of any great value were found
on the island they would have to be
mined in the national interest.
Because of the risk to valuable fauna
and flora, the two surveys already made
on the island were by teams from the
Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research in accordance with procedures
recommended by the Fauna Protection
Society.
The Royal Forest and Bird Society
also is strongly opposed to the island
being commercialised; wants it pre-
served as a sanctuary. A vice-president
of the society, Professor W. R.
McGregor, a former professor of
zoology at Auckland University, says
Coppermine Island is a typical part of
New Zealand and nothing could replace
it.
He says it is one of the world’s
unique bird sanctuaries. It is a shelter-
ing place for a number of sea birds, one
of the last strongholds of the saddle-
back; the shearwater, which is becom-
ing a rare bird, also breeds there and
the island is one of the last breeding
refuges of the tuatara . . . like a large
lizard, but in fact a living fossil and sole
survivor of the Rhynchocephala, which
inhabited the earth more than a hun-
dred million years ago.
COMMENT
The last vive?
DE GAULLE’S LUCK was too good
to last. To have been able to register
the trade-marks of greatness twice
as the leader of the Free French and
then as the saviour of his country’s
stability during the Algerian crisis
was more than could be expected by
most of those who have a concern for
how they will appear in the history
books.
De Gaulle has gone on playing the
game of greatness, but what was once
drama became comedy, and now, on
his skittish Canadian journey, farce. He
has become a gay old man, still stub-
bornly seeking the kicks he enjoyed so
much in his prime. For this purpose,
anything will do. Switch sides in Asia
to do the Americans in the eye. Lie
doggo on Israel to expose the British
as American puppets. Keep the head-
lines by introducing one novelty after
the other.
Great men always have an element
of the clown in them, but if the events
with which they are fiddling, or talking
about, are in themselves great, or if
they can wield one or more of the
elements of power, we usually forget
their clownishness and clothe them in a
seriousness of purpose. Strip them of a
direct relevance to events and their
clownishness is again obvious to us.
The 1930 s and 19405, when De Gaulle
was seasoned, were two great decades
for clowns. Some of the principal clowns
also precipitated massive slaughter and
other horrors so monstrous that it is
still difficult to remember that such
things happened. A man of the word,
rather than of violence, De Gaulle is
no murderer. But in his nationalist
obsession he is the last of a particular
generation of European clowns and
there is every sign that France will
happily not be the same without him.
However, he is a reminder that the
heroic style is still a feature of man-
kind, that human pride and the desire
for risk and excitement are as much
a human characteristic as pragmatism
and caution and the desire of men to
be peaceful and rational. In De Gaulle’s
case the heroic style now becomes
absurd because it has so obviously
drifted away from the power to carry
it into action. But in the case of many
unsettled societies, it is still directly
relevant. In Indonesia, for instance, the
present attempt to be pragmatic is
itself also heroic.
It is one of the dangerous tensions
of the modern world that an approach
to events that now seems old-fashioned
within the world of the settled, highly
industrialised societies still seems
relevant in the depressed areas of the
world. While the fortunate keep up
with their HP payments, the unfortun-
ate can still cherish the dreams of their
leaders’ rhetoric.




Should the Americans quit?
By a special correspondent
in Saigon
ONE DAY, when the Vietnam War is
over, the story goes, a Pulitzer Prize
will be awarded for the best piece of
subjective reporting. Nominations
come easily to mind. Much of the
writing about Vietnam has been bril-
liant; the only* trouble is that after
one has been there one wonders which
country the authors are talking about.
Yet the crack now current in Saigon
is less cynical than it sounds. Rarely
in the history of journalism has there
been a story which so negates the prin-
ciples of objective reporting and
analysis; and perhaps never has there
been a war in which it has been so
easy for reporters to lose all sight of
the basic issues.
To start with, for 95 percent of cor-
respondents it is possible to see the
war only from one side. True, the
Hanoi Government does admit a few
journalists and observers—but usually
persons who can be relied on to take
a sympathetic view of the communist
case (which is perhaps fair enough as
the ethics of public relations go but
is not how the Americans play it). But
entry into Viet Cong-controlled terri-
tory in South Vietnam is, for Western
correspondents, virtually impossible.
This is accepted as perfectly normal
by all journalists and is rarely adduced
as an argument to refute the com-
munist thesis that the Viet Cong is a
genuine, popular, “democratic” move-
ment.
The result is that almost every visi-
tor to Vietnam, from the moment of
arrival, is “on the American net,” and
is subjected to the unconscious pres-
sures, preconceptions, and occasional
brainwashing of Juspao, the Joint U.S.
Public Affairs Office, perhaps the most
gigantic government PR-juggernaut
ever devised. Inevitably, this produces
two diametrically opposite results:
either a ferocious scepticism which
refuses to accept anything the Ameri-
cans put out, or a helpless acceptance
of the daily avalanche of military and
political data, which all seems totally
unverifiable anyhow.
The reporter’s confusion is increased
by the presence of hordes of “un-
professionals” with an axe to grind,
though not all have the candor of
Miss Mary McCarthy (“I confess that
when I went to Vietnam early in Feb-
"Slow, faltering
progress
toward democracy"
ruary I was looking for material
damaging to the American interest
...”). Unleash the feminine mind in
an imbroglio like Vietnam, com-
pounded of muddle and pathos, cruelty
and confusion, and abounding with a
farrago of heart-tugging secondary
issues, and it will really go to town.
Then there is the current fashion in
Western papers for “trendy” reportage.
It is “trendy” to report in harrowing
detail the scene when an American
aircraft hits the wrong target, or to
analyse in depth the theatrical protesta-
tions of the Buddhists (although at the
moment the Buddhists have about as
much influence on the political situa-
tion as the Synod of the Anglican
Church has on Harold Holt’s Budget
plans). It is not “trendy,” apparently,
to report in detail the slow, faltering
progress toward democracy embodied
in the recent rural elections in the
South, or the scene whenever a Viet
Cong assassination squad executes half
a dozen pro-government headmen or
teachers (because that would be
swallowing American propaganda).
For European correspondents who
have felt the tang of genuine colonial
rebellions a special dilemma arises. It is,
for instance, almost a reflex action to
assume that because the British have
repeatedly misjudged the nature of
nationalist movements in many parts
of the world, especially in the 19505,
the Americans must.be doing the same
in Vietnam today. The British made
the mistake of refusing to come to
terms soon enough with Kenyatta,
Makarios, Banda (Nasser himself if you
like), and a pantheon of other national-
ist leaders; so it follows that the
Americans must be making the same
mistake vis-a-vis the leaders of the
Viet Cong. Seen from afar, it is an
inviting sophistry, enhanced by the in-
disputable fact that in the 1945-54
period at least the Viet Minh, the
progenitor of the Viet Cong, did have
the characteristics of a genuine (albeit
communist-led) anti-colonial move-
ment.
The trouble is that in Vietnam the
whole thing just smells differently. No
Vietnamese I talked to ever spoke of
the Viet Cong as if it were his move-
ment; they talk about “them.” As the
demonstrations in Saigon earlier this
year showed, a good many Vietnamese
relish the opportunity to burn the Viet
Cong leaders and Ho Chi Minh in
effigy. Did one ever see the Cypriots
burning Makarios in effigy in 1955-59,
even though many of them disagreed
with his tactics? Or Africans doing the
same to Kenyatta?
It is too easily overlooked that
several large elements in South Viet-
nam’s 15 million people have a built-
in aversion to communist rule how-
ever much they may (quite rightly)
disagree with the Saigon Government
and democratically squabble among
themselves; the \\ million Roman
Catholics, mainly refugees from the
North, the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao sects
(who number about five million be-
tween them), the Chinese merchants
of Cholon, and other minority groups.
Then there are the monthly defection
figures. True, the desertion rate from
the South Vietnamese Army is still
far too high; but it is significant that
the South Vietnamese deserters usually
drift home to their families, whereas
the Viet Cong defectors who come in
under the Chieu Hoi “open arms”
program usually make a calculated
switch to the government side and are
doing so in increasing numbers.
But the surest way of finding out
what people really think about the
Communists is to go into a village
which has been raided by the Viet
Cong the night before. Language may
be a barrier; the expressions on the
faces tell a lot. Do these people genu-
inely want the Viet Cong in preference
to even a rickety, pseudo-democratic
regime in Saigon? Do they want the
Americans to quit “because they’re
causing all the trouble”? Some people
argue that they do. But it’s worth
having another look at those faces.
The point is worth elaborating, be-
cause it is pivotal to the whole con-
troversy. Indeed, it might be argued
that the whole Left-wing interpreta-
tion of the Vietnam War is not pro-
U.S. medics treat a Viet Cong soldier
gressive enough: it sees the conflict
in terms of the pre-1954 situation, and
not in terms of 1967.
Before 1954 there was a straight
colonial war in Vietnam. After that,
South Vietnam became a country in
its own right, with at least as much
independence from outside powers as
North Vietnam had. The second Viet-
nam war is about which system is to
rule in Saigon. It is a conflict of the
post-colonial period. And in the past
13 years a great many Vietnamese have
tasted communist rule, and a lot of
water and blood has flowed under the
bridge. There is no reason to believe
that the estimate of 50,000 civilians
murdered or kidnapped by the Com-
munists since 1954 is exaggerated. The
case for the American presence in
defence of the South Vietnamese was
summed up succinctly by the
“Guardian” on June 6:
It is a mistake ... to assume too
readily that people in South Vietnam
would prefer communist rule to an
extension of the security that Ameri-
can operations has brought to many
of the populated areas. The Viet-
namese have been through a terrible
experience and their sufferings are not
finished. It does not follow, however,
that the shortest route to a peaceful
life is by allowing the Viet Cong to
take over.
So much for the Americans’ pres-
ence. But what about their methods
are they going about things the
right way? At this point the mind
reels, and the eardrums are bruised
with the babel of conflicting opinions.
When one watches the Americans
in action, one is reminded of the
memorable dictum of the colonel in
“The Teahouse of the August Moon”
Marines charge enemy hunkers near the DMZ
—“I’ll teach you people democracy even
if I have to shoot you in the process.”
In so many glaring ways the American
effort is both ineffectual and elephan-
tine. There is the bewildering prolifera-
tion of overlapping agencies and pro-
grams, all of them, no doubt, com-
peting with each other for the kudos,
and the budgetary benefits, which can
be bestowed by their masters in
Washington. There is (or has been)
Macv and Oco, Usaid, Usom, and
Juspao, not to mention Cacs and Vats,
and New Life and Self-Help and,
as a bonus, Civil Affairs and Civil
Action (which are not to be confused):
the American penchant for over-
organisation turned into a nightmarish
extravaganza, in the heart of the jungle.
The story goes of one observer who
arrived, had a look at it for 48 hours,
.decided the whole thing was a non-
sense, and quit.
Then there are the übiquitous whiz-
kids and CIA men, out to carve quick
reputations for themselves, and too
often insensitive to Asian history and
mentality; the endless, inevitable
squabbles between the soldiers and the
civilians; the ham-stringing effect of
the 12-month posting rule, which
means that for a good part of their
stint the individual soldiers are in-
effectual (for the first few months they
are settling in, during the last couple
of months they are thinking of getting
home). Above all, there is the pre-
sumptuousness which goes along with
the inherent 4 mer iean sense of omnipo-
tence. Although at every turn
officials stress that they are in Vietnam
“Pilots take immense
pains . . . to avoid
hitting civilians"
only to “assist” the Vietnamese, when
it gets down to brass tacks they (usu-
ally unintentionally) give the impres-
sion that they are running the show
whether the show be a major operation
or a demonstration in watermelon
husbandry.
Human nature being what it is, these
defects are probably inseparable from
a vast operation of this kind. And in
fairness it should be said that, in addi-
tion to the whiz-kids, there are a great
many balanced, perceptive Americans
who fully realise that their methods
are defective, and that the situation
will never be resolved by brute force
alone. Paradoxically, one of the encour-
aging things about the American effort
is that there is a disparity between
what officials say publicly and what
they say privately. The former state-
ments, often for domestic consumption,
are over-optimistic; the private off-the-
record briefings often reflect a shrewd
appreciation of the true situation and
the difficulties still to be encountered.
These are generalisations. What of
the more particular allegations levelled
against the Americans? First, the
bombing. It is part of the through-the-
looking-glass distortion of the outside
view of the war that the bombing
transcends all else in importance. In
Vietnam it seems just one more ele-
ment in an unending tribulation;
people have been getting killed for so
long that it does not seem to matter
greatly whether death comes from a
bomb or a bullet, a gun or a grenade.
There are two separate issues which,
like everything in Vietnam, have be-
come hopelessly confused. How ruth-
less is the bombing? How far is it
militarily effective? The testimony of
most correspondents who have flown
on American air strikes is that the
pilots take immense pains to pinpoint
their targets, and in particular to avoid
hitting civilians. When one is sitting
in a slow-moving Forward Air Control
reconnaissance plane awaiting “ground
clearance” from a local Vietnamese
official nervously asking the pilot
Across Song Cai River on a search and destroy mission


as he circles the Viet Cong target
what-the-hell-he’s-hanging-around-for
one cannot suppress the thought that
the vast battalion of well-meaning
clergymen, university dons, and
theatrical luminaries who are falling
over themselves to sign full-page
denunciations of American “atrocities”
may be, to put it mildly, somewhat
misinformed.
If one cross-examines the Yankee
Station pilots who have carried out the
bulk of the raids on North Vietnam
(an exercise which Mr. Harrison Salis-
bury, of the “New York Times,” neg-
lected in his appraisal of the bombing
of the North) this impression is
strengthened. No doubt some of the
bombs do hit civilian buildings; but if
there is any evidence that they are
deliberately aimed at civilian targets
the pilots are ruthlessly carpeted. In
sum: it is hard to escape the con-
clusion that the international furore
over bombing atrocities is a nonsense.
Whether the military gains achieved
by the bombing of North Vietnam out-
weigh the political disadvantages is,
however, another matter. Despite the
relentless pounding of installations and
supply routes, arms and equipment
continue to filter through from the
North to the communist units in the
South. Inevitably, the Americans re-
tort that, but for the bombing, the flow
would be infinitely greater; and it is
perhaps significant that the Viet Cong
is now concentrating its main military
effort in the First Corps area—in the
northern part of South Vietnam, below
the demilitarised zone where its
supply lines are shortest. But the more
serious argument against the bombing
is that it may be stiffening rather than
undermining North Vietnam’s will to
resist. From information that percolates
through, by way of the International
Control Commission and other sources,
this is at least arguable. And the
Americans have now lost over 2000
aircraft planes and helicopters in
the past 2J years, nearly 600 of them
over the North.
There may be no short-cuts; no
alternative to the hard, bitter, bloody
slog that has characterised the recent
fighting in Quan Tin and other pro-
vinces south of the demilitarised zone,
where large Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese regular forces are now
concentrated. The Americans’ weekly
casualty list for the seven days ending
May 28 was their highest of the war
(313 dead and 2616 wounded). May
was also the bloodiest month in the six
years America has been in the war
with 1177 men killed. And it is too
easily forgotten that the South Viet-
namese casualties, including assassina-
tions by terrorists, are always a good
bit higher.
Why Hanoi persists in committing
its troops to open engagements is a
mystery. Prestige considerations may
play a small part, but it is more likely
that Ho Chi Minh and his lieutenants
are desperately anxious to maintain
their supply routes through Laos, and
also to bog down thousands of the
best American troops in the intractable
terrain of the central highlands. One
important fact that has emerged from
recently captured documents is that
the Viet Cong command, under its
North Vietnamese supremo, General
Thanh, regularly sends back to Hanoi
wildly exaggerated estimates of Ameri-
can casualties from the open encoun-
ters. In some cases the number of
dead has been multiplied about 20
times. The allied figures of commu-
nist dead are obviously pretty high, too,
but not as far out as that. The Hanoi
Government is receiving a distorted
picture of the progress of the war,
which may have led it to dangerous mis-
calculations, and may still do.
One humanitarian side-effect of the
present concentration of the war in the
northern provinces is that there is less
bloodshed in the much more densely
populated South, particularly in the
Mekong delta. Paradoxically, this may
suit both sides. The Americans are
spared the opprobrium of having to
embroil innocent civilians in their
operations; while the Viet Cong feel
they can achieve their objectives in the
South better by psychological warfare
and terrorism and by trying to
paralyse the joint American-Vietnamese
program of pacification or “Revolu-
tionary Development.” Unfortunately,
this is all too easy for them to do.
There are two basic axioms about
pacification which need to be stressed
at the outset: first, that it needs to be
implemented as far as possible by the
Vietnamese (and other Asians) rather
than the Americans; and, second, that
it may take ten to 15 years for any
real, long-term success to be assured.
The first of these points is acknow-
ledged by the Americans freely; the
second privately. Within the past
month an important development has
taken place. Control of the American
side of the program has been taken out
of civilian hands and given to the
commander-in-chief, General West-
moreland. The logic behind this deci-
sion is that pacification can never work
unless there is guaranteed security
and this implies a military participa-
tion. The telescoping of military and
civilian operations also means that a
lot of the administrative bickering
should cease. Many observers believe
that the new system will operate more
effectively than the last; but it may
make the American troops look in-
creasingly like an army of occupation,
an impression they have always tried
to avoid.
Over the past nine months (and
American officials argue that only last
autumn did pacification really get
under way) the whole program has
been a curious hotch-potch of whiz-
kiddery, preconceived theory, and pains-
taking trial-and-error pragmatism
with, it is fair to add, a good dash of
honest endeavor and American
idealism thrown in. Some of the best
results have been achieved by unpre-
tentious units like the marines’ “Com-
bined Action Companies” in the First
Corps area, where small detachments
of selected American troops live with
South Vietnamese troops at key points
in various hamlets, providing both a
physical sense of protection from the
Viet Cong and all manner of impro-
vised assistance in the daily chores of
rural life.
How far the more ambitious 59-
member Revolutionary Development
cadres are making an impact is hard
to judge. In theory it is splendid
trying to beat the Communists at their
own game. But in many areas the
cadres are haunted by the bogy of
insecurity; and to recruit people of
the right calibre is difficult. This shows
up in all fields of Vietnamese adminis-
tration; so many of the people of
integrity and intelligence have already
been bumped off by the Viet Cong.
Little daily incidents vividly focus
the issues. Visiting one of the more
“secure” (always a relative term in
Vietnam) hamlets in Phu Yen pro-
vince, your correspondent was given a
most impressive rundown of what

in the previous twelve months; there
was medical aid, educational facilities,
care of refugees, care of the Chieu Hoi
defectors, animal husbandry, and so
forth. Here at last seemed to be an
oasis of security and progress. Then,
in a most matter-of-fact aside, a young
American official casually remarked,
“Of course, the local police chief and
his girlfriend got assassinated the other
night just a mile or two from our
headquarters.”
A visit to an RD cadre at a village
near Hue—suggested by the Americans
as a place where a fair amount of
pacification progress was taking place
in “difficult” conditions was even
more macabre. A village headman and
five of the leading villagers had been
put up against a wall and shot by the
Communists a few hours before: the
whole hamlet was made to watch.
Multiply this kind of thing a thou-
sand times and one has a not-too-
distorted picture of the realities of
Vietnam; live with it long enough and
defeatism inevitably creeps in. The
Americans, many people argue, are
simply fighting an unwinnable war. But
the Americans are by now so com-
mitted morally and materially to
defending the South Vietnamese that
to pull out would be an appalling dere-
liction of their responsibilities, apart
from what it would do to the Ameri-
cans themselves. The situation would
look more soluble if there were genu-
inely democratic elements within the
Viet Cong with whom the Americans
and the Saigon Government could
deal. Unfortunately, there is no one in
the National Liberation Front who
comes within miles of the necessary
stature. All the available evidence sug-
gests that the Viet Cong is as tightly
controlled by Hanoi as ever.
Much will depend on what happens
in Saigon politics in the coming
months. Marshal Ky has vowed that,
if given the chance, he will seriously
try to clean up corruption, which has
long been a golden propaganda point
for the Communists. We’ll see. More
concretely, the first phase of the rural
elections to choose village and ham-
let councils has just been completed,
reasonably satisfactorily. The poll
fluctuated between 60 and 84 percent,
despite a sustained Viet Cong intimida-
tion campaign directed against both
candidates and voters. The slow restora-
tion of grassroots democracy may help
in a small way to generate an atmos-
phere of confidence for the more
important elections for the presidency
and the Upper House, the 60-seat
Senate, of the new National Assembly,
on September 3. Elections for the 120-
member House of Representatives will
be held on November 5.
A troublesome question is how well
in the coming weeks the Thieu-Ky
ticket can hang together. Marshal Ky,
the Prime Minister, was pressured into
withdrawing from the presidential fight
in favor of Thieu, and is his running
mate for the vice-presidency. Against
Thieu there will be about ten civilian
candidates.
Superficially, this may look like a
robust, democratic free-for-all, but in
the context of Vietnam’s recent his-
tory it is all slightly ominous. Nothing
is more important than that, for the
time being, the generals should hang
together; otherwise they may hang
separately, and a lot of civilians with
them. Realistically, the best upshot that
can be hoped for in South Vietnam is
a semi-democratic regime with a
strong executive. In brass tacks, this
may imply the paramountcy of the
soldiers over the civilians, but there is
no reason why plenty of civilians should
not be included in the government. To
talk about a coalition with the Com-
munists, as some Western observers do,
is totally unrealistic. Can those two
groups of people be expected to co-
operate around a cabinet table after
years spent in trying to kill each other?
Any attempt to draw the strands of
the Vietnam situation together into a
meaningful pattern is presumptuous.
At times the Americans seem to have
embarked on a crash program not
merely to establish democracy but to
extirpate original sin. One cannot but
wonder whether the Americans, with
their taste for quick results, can main-
tain the momentum of their present
effort. In Ho Chi Minh’s own words,
“The Americans don’t like long, in-
conclusive wars, and this is going to be
a long, inconclusive war.” What hap-
pens if, by this time next year, the
hard, bitter slog has not produced more
dramatically successful results? But for
all the contradictions, for all the cor-
ruption and confusion, the bicycles and
the bar-girls, there is in Saigon an
underlying sense of something import-
ant being decided. The basic issue is
that the people of South Vietnam
should be allowed to live in relative
freedom and security, to pursue pros-
perity in their own way. The many
critics of American policy—not least
the Secretary-General of the United
Nations, who would do well to refrain
from partisan pronouncements based on
inadequate personal knowledge—should
seriously ask themselves how this is to
be permanently achieved. By letting the
South Vietnamese be taken over by
the Viet Cong?

to the electric power industry
account for over two-thirds of the
engineering performed by Gibbs
& Hill, Inc., a Dravo subsidiary,
which places that firm among the
leaders in power engineering.
Gibbs & Hill's experience with
nuclear energy goes back to the
"Manhattan project" during
World War 11. Later came work
on atomic submarines and re-
search particle accelerators. In
1955, G & H designed Europe's
first operating pressurized-water
nuclear power plant. Since then,
services have been provided on
nuclear power projects valued at
more than a billion dollars, in-
cluding Europe's largest pressur-
ized-water plant near Zurich.
Dravo nuclear engineering
services include national surveys
of power potentials; technical
and economic feasibility studies;
plant design, specification and
construction ; personnel training ;
and plant start-up.
Designing nuclear and con-

Getting both
feet in the door
By MARGO RATCLIFFE
IN A SMALL suburban lounge, scat-
tered with children and occasional
tables, 13 housewives were being divided
into two teams while their children ate
buttered scones and spilled orange juice
on the floral carpet. The fourteenth
woman, pleasant-faced, ordinary, but
with a faint air of abstraction that dis-
tinguished her from the rest, was hand-
ing out straws.
“What we have to do,” she said, as
cajolingly as a kindergarten mistress
introducing a lovely new game, “is to
keep this piece of cottonwool on the
end of the straw. All we have to do is
to suck hard on the straw. Now pass
the cottonwool down your team with-
out touching it with your hands and
we’ll see which team wins.”
The women inhaled on their straws,
white cards bearing their Christian
names heaving with their bosoms. When
the team skippered by “Gran” lost the
contest because “Gran” couldn’t inhale
long enough, or didn’t seem to want
to try, the teams then took turns to
sing songs with female names in the
titles. When “Gran’s” team ran out of
songs it lost again, but every one was
awarded “E for Effort” and given a
Tupperware trinket as a prize. “Gran,”
after a lot of hectoring, chose a measur-
ing spoon in lettuce-green, a decision
which seemed to worry her for the rest
of the morning.
This was a Tupperware party.
Fifteen hundred of them take place
throughout Australia every week. The
unvarying ritual is warm-up games, a
short lecture and demonstration of
Tupperware plastic products for the
kitchen—some of the 80 Tupperware
pieces are arranged on the dining-room
table for demonstration—and last, but
not least, the ordering and totting up
of sales over a nice cup of tea and a
piece of cake.
The “party plan” home-selling cam-
paign of Tupperware is a manifestation
of the salesman’s greatest dream to
get his foot in the door so that the
housewife can relax and hear him cry
the advantages of his wares. Tupper-
ware has been selling here for five
years and produces tens of thousands
of pieces a week from mixing bowls
to tumblers most of which are sold
through the party system. Unofficially
you can buy Tupperware straight from
a distributor. But, says a Tupperware
spokesman, Ron Stevens, this would
mean the breakdown of the party
system.
Direct selling is an expanding business
in Australia. At least a dozen firms
now operate on a door-to-door basis
throughout the country and about 50
smaller ones are in one or more States.
This is, of course, apart from the tradi-
tional door-to-door salesman; the egg-
and-butter man, the odd-job man, the
soft-drink seller, and so on.
Door-to-door salesmen find most of
their customers in working-class sub-
urbs. Householders in wealthier areas
might average three door-knockers a
year; middle-income groups can count
on about two a month; lower-income
groups up to one a week.
All salesmen, whether working on a
large or small scale, adopt one of three
techniques: hard, soft, or “no-sell.”
Tupperware is soft sell; so is Avon
Products of Canada. Avon saleswomen
have been working in Australia for five
years.
Avon demonstrators are given a kit-
bag full of sample cosmetics free (but
they pay $8 for the privilege of selling
Avon) plus a large collection of lavishly
illustrated brochures which hammer
home the Avon message: The Way to
Customers is through CALLS . . . To
make SALES and build EARNINGS
you need CUSTOMERS.
There are many inducements to
saleswomen to build up sales. Cars,
furniture, household items, even money
to “send a child through university”
are offered when sales reach certain
peaks.
The first present given to a suc-
cessful saleswoman is a jewelled pin.
These are presented at monthly sales
meetings held in each of the 70 zones
throughout Australia. Regional man-
agers preside and the saleswomen who
attend are dressed in their best, their
immaculately made-up faces proclaim-
ing their belief in the product. Those
with the highest sales records for the
month are named and stand, blushing,
to enthusiastic applause. Those who
haven’t done so well are named, too,
with an encouraging “I’m sure you’ll
do better next time, Mrs. X” to com-
plete their shame.
Avon saleswomen work close to home
and sell generally to their neighbors.
Although they are encouraged to look
as well groomed as possible, they tend
to have the same background and
The selling game
problems as their customers and often
take their children on selling trips
with them. Avon methods seem to
work; profits jumped from $231,809 to
$484,306 in 1966.
An example of the “no-sell” tech-
nique is Welcome Wagon International,
another American company. Welcome
Wagon has been revving up in Aus-
tralia for ten months and is due to move
into action shortly. In America there
are 5000 Welcome Wagon hostesses in
2000 cities. Twelve hostesses have been
trained here and the first operation
will be in a Sydney municipality.
Welcome Wagon hostesses shy away
from any taint of direct selling. They
are chosen, according to the company’s
representative, for their charm and
friendliness, and knock on doors of
newcomers to a suburb, or whenever
there has been a birth, wedding, anni-
versary, or 21st birthday in the family.
They carry with them, rather like
Red Riding Hood, a gondola-shaped
basket of goodies, provided by local
shopkeepers. The shopkeeper pays
Welcome Wagon a fee for each visit
the hostess makes. The shops benefit
by having their services explained and
promoted, the hostess receives a per-
centage of the fees paid by the sponsors,
and the householder receives the gifts.
One of the most interesting parts of
the hostess’ job is the “confidential
report” she submits to shopkeepers after
each home call. This report may in-
clude the make and age of the family
car and household equipment, hus-
band’s age and occupation, family’s
likes and dislikes. Direct salesmen
from the shops are likely to follow these

“We are selling not so much a cook-
ing utensil as a lifetime program,” Mr.
Wachwitz said. The lifetime program
has been selling here for six years after
40 years’ trial run in Seattle, U.S.A.
Rena-Ware has a staff here of 100 and
400 salesmen.
In Australia tentative steps have
been taken to curb the over-persuasive
salesman. In Victoria legislation gives
the householder five days to decide
whether he really wants the goods sold
to him on the doorstep; similar legis-
lation will be adopted in N.S.W. this
year.
The Australian Consumers’ Associ-
ation, which publishes the magazine
“Choice,” has compiled a file of
readers’ letters complaining about door-
step sales tactics. At least 40 different
products are mentioned in the house-
holders’ complaints. One such product
is a long-lasting spray for the outside of
the house which will kill mosquitoes
and flies as they approach the house;
another is a “high-frequency machine”
being offered for sale in Adelaide which
cures everything from backache to colds
and influenza; others include funeral
plots, soft drinks, gadgets, light fittings,
and photographs.
The Consumers’ Protection Council
is a six-man body set up by the Vic-
torian Government to deal with prob-
lems arising from everyday buying of
goods and services. The chairman, Mr.
David Bottomley, points out through-
out his bulletins that “the salesman
on the doorstep is in a monopoly posi-
tion—a situation which lends itself to
unscrupulous sales methods, particu-
larly where elderly or hospitably in-
clined consumers are concerned.”
The Council can only urge that
householders should insist on callers
producing adequate credentials or offer-
ing telephone numbers which can be
rung to check their bona fides. “When
a person who claims to be ‘doing a
survey’ announces that he is, in fact,
selling something,” says Mr. Bottomley,
“the householder should decline to do
business because the salesman has
already shown himself to be dishonest.”
The National Association of Direct
Selling Companies of Australia was
formed last year by some of the larger
home-sales companies to protect their
industry. Sydney representative, Mr.
Baird, of Avon Products, says that the
member companies are reputable and
prompt in answering complaints and
that applications for membership are
carefully vetted.
However, it seems unlikely that either
consumers’ or sellers’ protection societies
will ever be able to do anything about
the sort of salesman who recently
visited a Sydney woman and asked if
she had any old gold or silver for sale.
Pleased with his old-world courtesy,
she showed him a few pieces of jewel-
lery. He departed, saying he would
be back with cash in a day or two. He
did return, at night when she and her
husband were out, and stole $2OOO
worth of jewellery.

HOW
AMERICA HELPED
CHINA
GET THE
BOMB
By WILLIAM L. RYAN
and SAM SUMMERLIN
PRECISELY AT 3 P.M., Peking
time, October 16, 1964, a fireball
seared the autumn sky over Lop Nor
and the Takla Makan Desert in Red
China’s Sinkiang region, bathing the
barren flats in an eerie purple. Sensi-
tive nose scoops on American U-2
planes prowling the skies high over
China sucked in radioactive debris.
Halfway across the globe, worlds
apart from Lop Nor, only a few pre-
dawn lights burned in Washington.
Most Americans were asleep as tele-
phones jarred the quiet of the Penta-
gon and the White House. Later that
day U.S. leaders assured the country
that the first Chinese device was crude
and primitive.
Said President Johnson: “Its mili-
tary significance should not be over-
estimated. Many years and great efforts
separate the testing of a. first nuclear
device from having a stockpile of reli-
able weapons with effective delivery
systems.”
In Moscow a glum one-line report
relayed the news to Russians, pre-
occupied with the backlash of a plot
that had ousted Nikita Khrushchev
from power only a day before. But un-
like Americans, who were accustomed
to the notion that the Chinese were
hopelessly backward, the Russians had
few illusions about China’s potential.
It was a sardonic twist of history that
the United States and Russia, each
having once considered China a reli-
able ally and each having given China
significant help toward breaking into
the Nuclear Club, were the two nations
most appalled by the prospect of
Chinese membership. This anxiety
deepened when China, less than three
years later, exploded its first H-bomb.
Russia had helped for political rea-
sons. The Americans had hfelped
through what many in responsible
positions called sheer stupidity. A
hysterical fear that “Reds” lurked
under every bed persuaded the United
States to hand over key men two in
particular who would lift Red China
quickly from apprenticeship to full
Nuclear Club membership by placing
an atom bomb on the snout of a
missile.
In China, for Tsien Hsue Shen and
Chao Chung Yao, two top architects
of their nation’s nuclear program, and
for other returned scientists trained in
the West, it was a time, perhaps, to
savor the bitter-sweet taste of revenge.
Missile genius Tsien and A-bomb
creator Chao, alumni of the California
Institute of Technology, could remem-
ber America, whose McCarthy era of
witch-hunting had made them unwel-
come guests..
Some in America remembered what
a U.S. official had said of Dr. Tsien:
“I’d rather shoot him than let him
leave this country. He knows too
much.”
But go Tsien did. So did Chao. So
did 80-odd other talented Chinese
scientists who, between 1930 and 1950,
had made their marks on some of
America’s most prestigious campuses.
They took with them huge stores of
bitterness and rich funds of informa-
tion gathered when U.S. leaders con-
sidered them allies. For Chao, the
physicist once welcomed as an observer
of America’s nuclear-weapons program,
the dreary saga of suspicion had ended
with his escape from U.S. authorities
desperate to stop him. For Tsien, the
gentle genius of rocketry, the agony
was prolonged. The American world
of H. S. Tsien, as he called himself in
California, was shattered when the
FBI knocked on his door early in the
summer of 1950. But the story of this
man from Shanghai and of America’s
costly gifts of talent to Red China had
begun long before indeed, even be-
fore Tsien dreamed of a scientific
career in the United States. It began
with a decision made by a man Tsien
had never met a World War I
veteran named William F. Hynes.
Discharged as a lieutenant in 1919,
Bill Hynes found his hometown of St.
Louis had little promise for him. He
headed west and discovered his niche
in the Los Angeles Police Depart-
ment. There, for 20 years, he played
his small part in fashioning one seg-
ment of a complex net. It was woven
bit by tiny bit, sometimes accidentally,
sometimes by design. Eventually it
would be cast into a murky American
sea of suspicion and hysteria to catch
whatever victims might blunder into it.
The Bolshevik ogre with beard and
bomb had risen from the ashes of war,
and it gave Hynes his vocation. Ad-
mired by his superiors for his zeal as
a police officer, he was directed to turn
in his pistol and badge and go under-
ground into the netherworld of Com-
munism. The department nicknamed
him “Red.” It had nothing to do with
his hair, which was sandy. It was,
instead, a tribute to the ardor of his
one-man crusade against Communists.
Hynes bluffed his way into secre-
taryship of the strike committee of
the Wobblies the revolutionary In-


dustrial Workers of the World and
editorship of the IWW Strike Bulle-
tin. When the rowdy Wobblies called
a nation-wide general strike in 1923,
Hynes played his California part
deftly. The strike was smashed, and,
casting off his masquerade, Hynes tes-
tified against the ringleaders. His con-
tributions to the destruction of the
IWW in Southern California brought
him torrents of threats and abuse from
the Left, but Hynes continued single-
mindedly on his crusade.
William Ward Kimple first met
Hynes when the “Red Squad” chief
addressed a Police Academy meeting
one day in 1924. Kimple had wanted
to be a traffic cop, but Hynes had
other ideas. “Mr. Hynes called me in,
and I got my second choice,” Kimple
recalls. “Red took away my gun and
badge and sent me to join the IWW.
I was a Communist for the rest of my
career in the Police Department 2O
years of it.”
Clara Osvald, widow of a Police
Commissioner, was Kimple’s girlfriend.
Kimple disliked writing reports on his
activities, so Clara took over. “Who
in hell is writing these reports?” Hynes
demanded one day. Kimple told him.
Hynes promptly put Clara on the pay-
roll, as an informer.
Communists from New York ran the
Red show in California, and Kimple
had bad luck trying to get beyond the
status of “sympathiser.” Clara did
better. She won the confidence of a
woman Communist from the East.
“Clara,” the woman told her one day,
“you’re not a Wobbly. You’re a Com-
munist.” They took her into the Party
in 1927, and a year later Kimple
joined. Using the Party name “Bill
Ward,” Kimple manoeuvred himself
into the post of assistant membership
director for Los Angeles County. Clara
became dues secretary. William Ward
Kimple was declared officially dead.
His mother, never learning the truth,
collected his insurance.
Kimple posed as an automobile
mechanic and made himself useful to
the Communists by patching up old
wrecks for use in such enterprises as
protest parades. On behalf of Hynes,
whom he admired greatly, Kimple
watched and reported on the violent
activities of the Communists during the
desperate days of the Great Depres-
sion. In Southern California, those were
times of running battles between police
and Communists, waves of strikes, riots,
rallies, and “stink-bombing” raids on
theatres.
The terror of the Communists was
Red Hynes. “If they had let him have
his way, he would have killed the Com-
munist Party in California,” Kimple
said. “Red would walk into their meet-
ing places, break up their rallies, seize
their records, arrest them on any
grounds he could find even for spit-
ting on sidewalks. When Red Hynes
burst into a meeting, all the Com-
munists turned pale.”
Many considered the Red Squad
more strike-breaker than anything else.
In 1938, the mayor of Los Angeles
officially abolished it. Hynes and two
others became a downgraded anti-spy
intelligence detail. But Hynes felt he
could count on one important source
of influence. Whenever J. Edgar
Hoover, of the FBI, travelled to Los
Angeles, the Red Squad chief made
every effort to see him.
As for Kimple, he was running into
difficulties. Communists were suspicious
of him and barred him from some
meetings. Unwittingly enough, how-
ever, Hynes and Kimple already had
played their part in history, a part
that would help the entry of an enor-
mous, backward communist power into
the Nuclear Missile Club. Before the
Red Squad was abolished, a trap had
been set. It would take 12 years more
for it to claim its most important
captive.

Outside the scientific community,
Theodore von Karman, until he died
at 81 in 1963, was an obscure, scholarly
Hungarian Jew. To the scientific world,
Dr. Tsien. .. missile genius
he was a genius who had probed the
mysteries of wind and space and left
a heritage of conquest that would
permit men to hurl missiles across un-
dreamed-of barriers. To Tsien Hsue
Shen, Dr. von Karman was like a god.
When Tsien arrived in the United
States in 1935 on scholarship funds
contributed by the U.S. from its share
of Boxer Rebellion indemnities paid by
China—von Karman’s Aeronautics De-
partment at Caltech was already cele-
brated, and only those capable of the
most rigid discipline could qualify to
work and study there. Tsien had the
qualities and the discipline. After tak-
ing his master’s degree at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1936, he
quickly arranged to head for his mecca,
eager to achieve his Ph.D. in aero-
dynamics, the young science that had
captured his imagination during his
year in New England. Caltech embraced
him, as it has few students in its
illustrious 75-year history.
Tsien, then only 26, the son of a
Shanghai scholar, was so absorbed in
his life work that to many, socially, he
seemed rude. He disdained small talk.
If his companions at a social gathering
could not speak the language of science,
his conversation dried up.
When Tsien arrived at Caltech, an-
other brilliant Chinese already had been
there for ten years and made his mark
as a top-notch physicist. Like Tsien,
Chao Chung Yao was from Shanghai,
never drank or smoked, was deadly
serious about his profession, was a
lover of classical music. Unlike his com-
patriot, Chao mixed well with Chinese
and Americans alike and enjoyed a
good game of tennis. Both lived for
their work. The campus was their life.
California was not a hospitable at-
mosphere for Chinese. As a community,
Pasadena frowned on residents with
yellow skin —in the opinion of many,
even more so than on Negroes. Tsien
and Chao had few friends off campus.
The two Chinese tended to appreciate
those who judged them only on the
basis of their achievements.
Perhaps if Tsien had not owned and
driven an automobile, things might have
turned out differently for him and
for history. Dr. Sidney Weinbaum, a
physicist at Caltech, could not drive.
His Chinese friend, 11 years his junior,
could. Moreover, they both felt the
same way about classical music. So Dr.
Weinbaum asked his shy young associate
to drive him to the homes of Pasadena
friends for what ostensibly might have
been just quiet evenings of fine music
and high-level conversation.
Actually, Tsien, perhaps unwittingly,
was mingling with “Professional Unit
122, Pasadena Section, Communist
Party of the United States.”
All across Los Angeles in 1938 there
were units and branches of the Com-
munist Party. Participants were from
all strata: there were doctors, lawyers,
motion-picture writers and designers,
scientists, scholars.
Unit 122 was an odd assortment of
members, as was brought out in later
Government proceedings. Several were
physicists. One named was an eccentric
professor, Frank J. Malina, who
dreamed of shooting rockets to the moon
and was ridiculed until he proved his
dreams could come true. Another was
Dr. Frank Oppenheimer, scientist
brother of the celebrated physicist Dr.
J. Robert Oppenheimer. One was a
chemist, one a graduate student, another
a movie costumer. Seldom were there
more than 15 at any one gathering.
Binding them together was the person-
ality of Dr. Sidney Weinbaum.
In the weekly meetings, Dr. Wein-
baum enjoyed the company of those
who could share his gloomy forebodings
and listen sympathetically to his dimly
defined views of how the world might
be saved from cataclysm. Dr. Weinbaum
said what was happening in Europe in
1938 foretokened disaster. Adolf Plitler
already had taken over Austria. In Italy,
Benito Mussolini had pledged all sup-
port to the Nazi Fuhrer. Spain’s Civil

OVERSEAS
“Whitey ain’t about to get up”
AS THE PATTERN of racial violence
scarred city after city across the United
States, leaving in its wake debris-
littered streets, the burned and looted
shops, the dead and the injured and
always the new legacies of hatred and
bitterness one battle-worn National
Guardsman said, “This is just like two
countries fighting.”
It is the “two countries” that has
always been at the heart of the violence
that exploded in Harlem, New' York,
in 1965, in the Watts district of Los
Angeles in 1965, in Chicago’s West Side
and Cleveland in 1966, and in Buffalo,
Boston, Newark, Chicago, Grand
Rapids, Phoenix, South Bend, and a
score of other communities this spring
and “long hot summer” whose end is
not yet in sight.
There is the country of the w'hites
relatively prosperous, unencumbered
for the most part by insurmountable
social and economic barriers free to
shape its own destiny.
And then there is the country of the
Negroes a country whose capital is
the ghetto, w'hose constitution states that
“all men are created equal, but Whitey
comes first,” and whose statistics still
spell out a largely unchanging picture,
despite new' laws on the books, of higher
unemployment than w'hites, poorer edu-
cation, poorer housing, poorer you
name it.
"I do not believe there will be any
violence in Newark this summer,” said
Mayor Hugh J. Addonizio in May.
Newark, half of whose population is
Negro the largest proportion of any
city in the North had been compara-
tively free of racial trouble. But the
Mayor - like those last w r eek in New
York, Detroit, Cleveland, and the rest
of the 80 riot-torn cities across the
nation had only limited power to
deal with the basic combustible elements
that keep every Negro ghetto at the
flash point.
In State after State, as violence
spread, Negro youths roamed the streets,
smashed window's and looted stores, and
hurled rocks at the police. The ram-
paging grew worse. The Negroes now'
brought out their arms, firebombed
stores, battled with firemen trying to
control the blazes, and took up positions
on rooftops to exchange shots with the
National Guardsmen and Federal
troops.
At times, amid scenes that made cities
look like battlefields, there w'as an
almost carnival atmosphere. Negro
housewives calmly invaded shops and
supermarkets that did not bear signs
saying “Soul Brother” a kind of
password among Negroes during the
riots and walked off wuth everything
they could carry. Said one woman as
she lifted bread off a supermarket shelf:
“The brother’s got to take everything
he gets. Whitey ain’t about to get up
off of anything unless you make him.”
Nearby, several teenagers danced and
laughed in the street as two of them
held aloft sticks with vellow wigs on
them. “We’ve scalped the white man!”
they shouted.
“It’s like laughing at a funeral,” said
a city official. “The line between the
jungle and the law has to be drawn
somewhere.” But the line kept snaking
ahead into new violence, and behind it
there were the other lines against which
the Negro is pressing with ever-imreas-
ing force and impatience, precipitating
in return a sharp white backlash. The
struggle has riven the civil rights move-
ment itself, with the militant “black
power” elements increasingly challeng-
ing the moderates to act now, and act
strong because the waiting has been too
New York’s Spanish Harlem district after a night of rioting and killing
long. The traditional civil rights move-
ment is perplexed, angry, and, above all,
fearful about the future. The National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People remains alone in the
field where it has always been a mass
organisation that seeks its objectives
through legislation, court rulings, local
programs for Negro betterment.
The Congress of Racial Equality has
joined with the Student Nonviolent Co-
ordinating Committee in a revolution-
ary racialist and white-exclusionary
policy. SNCC and CORE are no longer
regarded as civil rights organisations in
the accepted sense. They are animated
by a direct-action, anti-white ideology.
The NAACP, with its 450,000 mem-
bers, thus feels frustrated in its task of
seeking change and ultimate equality
through the lawful process. It has been
the misfortune of this ably led organisa-
tion to be caught between the extremist
forces at work in the white and Negro
communities.
White obstructionism consists of
several elements. According to Roy
Wilkins, the NAACP’s executive dir-
ector, the white liberals who played a
significant role in the civil rights move-
ment have abandoned the movement
to concentrate their energies on the anti-
Vietnam war protest. The NAACP
knows that substantial achievements for
civil rights are unthinkable wdthout
white support and that the Negroes
cannot do the job alone.
Another obstructionist element are the
white people in the northern urban
cities who have blocked open housing
and school integration and have pro-
voked riots in their communities,
notably in Chicago.
Responsive to this rising opposition
of whites in the North, their Congress-
men have blocked, delayed, or defeated
new civil rights legislation. A recent
inflammatory Act was to approve an
Atomic Energy Commission's decision
to build a $375 million atom smasher
in Illinois, despite the fact that the
Illinois Senate has not yet enacted a
fair housing law.
These elements of the backlash in
action have depressed many of the
traditional civil rights workers and
frightened others into feeling that
instead of enjoying white support, as in
the past, the Negroes today are in-
volved in a more difficult confrontation
with the whites. The feeling of isolation
is growing, the demoralising effect is
snowballing.
The whites are not the sole problem
for the traditionalists. There is also a
black problem. The transformations of
SNCC and CORE are only symbols
of what has been happening in the
ghettos. Local black power groups have
proliferated throughout the country,
and succeeded in creating a climate of

In Plainfield, New Jersey, a search of
Negro houses for stolen arms
opinion that keeps the ghettos in a
turmoil.
This grassroots groundswell of mul-
tiple forms of black power has created
a serious problem for the NAACP,
because the black power groups preach
local direct action and have little or no
communication with the Federal
authorities or the NAACP.
Caught between white obstruction-
ism and black power, what course is
the NAACP to choose at this political
point in its long history? At its 58th
annual convention recently the
NAACP unanimously condemned the
riots (while placing much of the blame
on failure to correct social ills). But it
was thought significant that in his key-
note address Mr. Wilkins did not
attack black power. A year ago in Los
Angeles he denounced it as invitation
to murder.
But for the time being at least the
NAACP is expected to continue its
traditional approach.
The NAACP apparently sees the
only hope for the future in a restora-
tion of the alliance with white people
and its representatives in government
on all levels. The failure to restore the
alliance will, in the opinion of most
observers, ultimately open the road to
the black power apostles who advocate
a revolutionary conflict against the
white power structure as the only solu-
tion left to the depressed black masses
in the ghetto.

We like Hong Kong so much we go there every day. Step aboard in Sydney,
San Francisco, Honolulu or Manila and guess where you’re headed for. Hong Kong.
There’s only one way to avoid it. Get off the plane in time. Fortunately,
between Sydney and Hong Kong, being specialists in The East, we offer 65
different places to do just that. Starting with Manila. And ending up with
Zamboanga. Only one problem. It isn’t that easy
to get off. Because we fly with everything from
French pastry to classical music on the way. We
figure we’ve got you hooked once you get to Manila.
Because Hong Kong is only $4O away. Although
$9.65 to Baguio, return, is pretty enticing, too!

the British apologise publicly for their
actions against the Communists, punish
those responsible, release persons
arrested, give compensation for damage
and injuries, turn Hong Kong’s
Governor, Sir David Trench, over for
trial by a people’s court, pay “blood”
debts for “fascist atrocities,” cease “per-
secution” of the Hong Kong Chinese,
and do many other things of a similar
nature. Meanwhile, the Communists in
Hong Kong are staging riots and mob
attacks on police, city transport, and
public buildings with use of time bombs
and dynamite.
For the British to comply with
demands such as these would be an act
of broad submission. The British give
no indication of submission.
If the Communists have even larger
aims they have not stated them. They
have not, for example, asked the British
to give Hong Kong back to China.
True, they have not responded to
Hong Kong’s request for more water —■
on top of the quota purchased annually
from the Chinese mainland to help
the Colony through a severe drought.
They have inveighed against United
States warships bringing American ser-
vicemen from Vietnam for rest and
recreation. But they have not specifically
included among their demands an in-
sistence that the British stop this prac-
tice.
Hong Kong’s Reds show every indica-
tion of having launched their move-
ment without well-developed plans and
of improvising as things happen.
The Communists, checkmated in their
attempts to disrupt Hong Kong through
mass demonstrations and strikes, are
now waging urban guerilla warfare. A
bomb concealed in a straw effigy left
at a train terminal last week and which
injured eight people, three of them
children, was the most callous piece of
terrorism. As combat becomes more
bitter, the police are increasingly using
shotguns and carbines instead of the
tear gas and wooden pellet guns
employed earlier. So far the new com-
munist tactics have not succeeded in
causing a major upset in Hong Kong’s
life.
Making any prediction is highly
risky, but officials are inclined to think
there will be no calculated military in-
tervention in Hong Kong from main-
land China.
Without military intervention from
China, the British security forces
10,000 police and 8500 troops should
be able to cope with the communist
threat. The vast majority of Ilong Kong
people are opposed to the Communists,
and this should permit the city to con-
tinue operating and facilitate the isola-
tion of the Reds.
The prospects are that the struggle
will go on for months. Business will
suffer, but the community is showing a
resilience that should enable it to with-
stand whatever the local Communists
devise.

Liza, pronounced success
By CHARLES HIGHAM
ON STAGE at Chequers, Liza Minnelli
was gaminesque, butch-cut. Brisk and
crisp, she uses her small voice with
extraordinary expertness, moving from
speaking to singing and back again
with effortless control, and at least one
of her numbers had a genuine wit:
“Liza and Leesa,” a play on the pro-
nunciation of her name. She has the
genuine star’s trick of seeming a large
presence on the stage; off it, she seems
altogether smaller, paler, and more sub-
dued, although the fascinating off-
beat face, everything slightly lopsided
and yet extraordinarily appealing, is as
striking as ever and the charm entirely
undiminished. Her voice is that of a
little girl: nervous, eager, breathless.
She has just finished her first feature
film, “Chari ie Bubbles,” from a screen-
play by Shelagh Delaney, directed by
Albert Finney. "It was shot in London
and the north of England. I play an
American girl who gets a job as Fin-
ney’s secretary he plays a writer,
and she admires him very much. It
really hasn’t a story, it’s just about 48
hours in this girl’s life nothing’s
solved or resolved. And the comedy
arises out of the kind of situations that
would crop up in an average day.”
Had it been difficult to adapt to
film technique? "Yes. Everything on
the stage, where most of my training
has been, has to be exaggerated, and
for films you have to learn to be more
subdued and natural. And playing to
technicians isn’t easy you're doing a
big scene and some guy’s standing near
you with overalls on, he doesn’t care!
And they put lights under your chin,
you just feel so watched . . .
“Luckily I’ve had some Method
background, so I can block out every-
thing around me and concentrate. And
the very moment you stop concentrat-
ing it shows in your eyes on the
screen. It’s very strange.” From her
father, director Vincente Minnelli, she
had learned control of diction, and
from her mother absolute honesty in
delivering songs. She had watched
filming as a child, seeing her father
direct “Brigadoon” and “Kismet” and
“Gigi.” “It all seemed so boring then,
the waiting drives you crazy in film-
making, and I didn’t have any ambition
then. It was while I was at the Sor-
bonne that I decided to go into show
business.
“Or, rather, slightly before that,
when I saw ‘Bye, Bye Birdie’ on
Broadway. But I left the Sorbonne, and
I sent a telegram to Momma saying,
‘l’m coming home.’ I was bored in
France, and had my honors degree. So
I went back.
“My father said he thought my idea
of going on the stage was terrific. My
mother, though, had a typical mother’s
reaction ‘Oh, my poor baby!’ you
know. But after a few tears she sent
me packing to New York. The con-
ditions were they’d give me 200 dollars
and if nothing happened in a certain
amount of time I’d come home. In
New York 200 dollars lasts approxim-
ately two weeks. Even in the cheapest
place. I ran out of money and moved
in with a friend of mine, and I went
to an audition for an off-Broadway
show, ‘Best Foot Forward.’
“I auditioned for the ingenue, and I
sang one tearful song, and they cast
me in the comedy lead! At 35 dollars
a week! When that show ended I
auditioned for. ‘Flora the Red Menace,'
a musical about a Communist girl dur-
ing the Depression. I had to audition
seven times. As I walked on to the
stage the first time I heard George
Abott, the great theatrical producer,
say, ‘This is a waste of time.’ ” But
she was hired the seventh time through,
the musical was a huge success, and she
won the Tony.
“Horrendous” weeks on the road with
“Flora” had, she felt, resulted! in a
show less brilliant than it had been
originally. “In one day you can get
two new songs you have to sing the
same night, and you can have a whole
new scene to play, or, more difficult,
they change the order of sentences in
the same scene. By the time you get
to the stage you’re too tired to be
nervous.”
After “Flora” closed, she turned to
nightclubs. The. man who wrote “Flora,”
Fred Ebb, created an act for her, and
a choreographer, Ronald Field, worked
the whole thing out on the floor. Her
act is completely scripted and planned
down to the last detail, and she. had
been greatly disappointed that the
critics here hadn’t reviewed the show
as such. “They were all personal pieces,
not reviews. They all managed to say
that in 1964 Judy Garland was a
failure of some sort or other here, but
nobody managed to mention what a
Liza Minnelli on stage at Chequers, Sydney
Sharing the act with Peter Allen


good song ‘Liza, Leesa’ is. Nobody
seemed to mention the shape of the
program. Every time I open my
mouth I’m doing something that’s been
written carefully and thought out, and
they didn’t seem to realise that.” Her
■eyes, for a moment, were full of pain.
And they were again when I men-
tioned the big show she had done at
the London Palladium with Judy Gar-
land. She hadn’t wanted to do it, but
her mother had been very keen, so she’d
done it. “Momma sang five songs and
then she introduced me. By the time
I’d done the fourth song they’d accepted
me on my own terms, but it was tough
at first, coming on after her. And when
we were on stage I looked into her eyes
and there was nothing there for me,
they were just a blank. She was on
stage and was the star and she kept
forgetting me, forgetting I was there,
when she got to take bows.
“So I’d have to come leaping out
at her heels; it was really a question of
holding your own, and that was so
scary, it was something terrible!” Since
then, of course, Liza Minnelli had more
than held her own.

Painless pedagogy
By ELWYN LYNN
Rodin and his contemporaries; the
Peter Stuyvesant Collection. Art Gal-
lery of N.S.W., Sydney.
RODIN’S contemporaries here the
works date from 1850 to 1942 are
those who not only worked during
Rodin’s lifetime but also influenced
him, like Daumier and Carpeaux, and
were profoundly influenced by him, like
Maillol, Bourdelle, and Despiau. It is a
pity that we have nothing here by
Medardo Rosso, for his Yvette Guilbert
of 1894 is the mother of Bourdelle’s
■splendid mask of Beethoven of 1901,
and he exemplifies one of Rodin’s chief
purposes: to catch momentarily forms
that are fleeting, transitory, dissolving,
and fusing.
Yet such characteristics against the
background of impressionist painting
and impressionist music like Debussy’s
have been over-emphasised, Matisse
declaring that Rodin’s work lacke,d
wholeness! It is an emphasis that
neglects the range of feeling despair,
exuberance, courage, surrender in
Rodin’s work and takes little account
of earlier influences like Donatello’s
that reminded him of the impact of the
shrunken and emaciated, among other
features, and of Gothic elongation, here
giving spiritual presence to the two
figures from The Burghers of Calais,
where cloaks and ropes are forms as
living as those of taut leg and jutting
arm. For his lively, broken surfaces,
Rodin had predecessors in the
eighteenth century and looked as much
Rodin’s Flying Figure
to them, over the acres of soft, bal-
looning flesh of Victorian sculpture, as
to the Impressionist.
Whatever his sources he sought to
agitate the surface to express inner
feeling; where a Giacometti gouges the
surface to indicate resistance to time’s
erosion, Rodin balances -countless small
planes against smooth contours and
protuberances against hollows to express
movement; he had a model in Car-
peaux, but probably found his slabby
roughness and toss and twist of forms
too much a matter of superficial
modelling, and though he may have
been enlivened to the baroque by
Daumier he would have seen that the
satirical stance of Ratapoil merely
looks “modern.” In his distortions he
had a deeper purpose than satire. In
The Kiss, the silken, rippling flesh and
softly fusing forms indicate what it’s
all about, and he liked a dark, shining
finish not for mere effect but as Rilke,
once his secretary, wrote for “the gleam
and sparkle of the metal that breaks
like fire through the smoke-black
Datina ”

What Renoir, Degas, and Matisse
lost thiough rejecting an agitated sur-
face is a matter of conjecture, and cer-
tainly Renoir’s large blocky head could
have worn some surface modulation, but
sculpture was turning to cubism’s im-
pacted planes and one has only to
compare Duchamp-Villon’s Baudelaire
of 1911 (not in the show) and its
~.-, -n t ,
assertive formal austerity with Rodins
of 1898 with its squaied-up face
balanced by a spherical, expanding rest-
less skull. Against the bulk contends
Rodin s energetic line, as it does in
Despiau of 1927 and in the headless and
armless torso of Rodins Young Girl.
Rodin swung between restrained ex-
pressiveness and turbulent utterance.
avoiding those theatrical additives that
one gets in Gemito’s Giuseppi Verdi
of 1873: Rodin’s pair of elongated hands
lightly touch; another is twisted back
as though to receive a nail through
fhe palm. The energy that they embody
i s both that of life and of sculpture
and it was the energy in forms and
limbs that preoccupied Rodin; he was
fascinated by the relation between the
bfe of limbs. In his armless Walking
Man he want s to show how leg relates
to leg through the tough triangle of
space that separates them and escapes
under the right foot. In Iris, Messenger
°f Gods, he congeals a raised leg

little we have in Australia to illustrate
art’s continuity.
Opera
On a high note
By JOHN CARGHER
Turandot, Puccini. The Flying Dutch-
man, Wagner. Her Majesty’s, Mel-
bourne.
“THE MOUSE THAT ROARED.”
I can think of no greater compli-
ment to pay Morag Beaton, who should
never have been asked to sing Turandot
yet acquitted herself better than anyone
had any right to expect. If the Trust
allows her to sing Butterfly, Elsa, and
Santuzza instead of Tosca, Isolde, and
Aida, Miss Beaton will prove a most
valuable addition to this company
which seems about to come of age.
The new spirit which wafts across the
footlights may not be entirely the work
of Mr. Harry Miller. But there is no
greater encouragement to an art than
a full house, and nobody can deny that
Mr. Miller has more than earned his
fee at the box office.
There is a distinct feeling of to-
getherness about the company this year.
It may be imagination, but does the
excellent orchestra, so miraculously
created out of nothing, work in closer
collaboration with the artists on stage
than did the ABC? Whatever the
reason, the complete company of
singers, musicians, designers, and pro-
ducers have reached a standard of team-
work which it seems to me is close to
that found at Sadler’s Wells; the virtues
and the failings are the same.
The greatest asset at present is the
excellent balance of voices with the
occasional star performers, Donald
Smith and Raymond Myers, giving a
lift at the right moments. Ping, Pang,
and Pong, who can be pestilential bores,
became bearable and even enjoyable
when they are sung by well-blended
voices belonging to first-class actors
Ronald Maconaghie, Robert Gard, and
John Heffernan. What matter that Liu
(Rosemary Gordon) went excruciatingly
flat on her final note? Her performance
as a whole was good. What matter that
the lighting in “Turandot” was a mean-
ingless shambles of inappropriate cues?
The sets and costumes were good.
And let us be clear about this: this
is now a repertory company with
genuine hopes of becoming a continuing
entity. Perfection in repertory is rare
and only attained at the expense of
many failures.
The Princess Turandot must have
tremendous personal magnetism as well
a.s a great voice and physical beauty.
Morag Beaton is small in stature but has
a fine voice. She copes with the vocal
problem very well indeed. But she
could never achieve the icy hauteur
demanded by the part, nor is her pretty
face capable of portraying cruelty.
Donald Smith acts well and sings
superbly, while Rosemary Gordon may
reconsider her make-up as Liu, who is
one of Puccini’s tenderest heroines, not
a starving gipsy. The fault may lie with
producer Stephen Hall, whose return
to conventional staging I welcome,
though he had no call to revert to all
the worst aspects of traditionalism.
But the final success of this “Turan-
dot” lies with the magnificent chorus,
surely the best we have had yet. The
conducting of Robert Feist and the
playing of the new orchestra under his
direction fully justified the engagement
of both, though time (and some extra
strings) will improve even further on
this fine first effort.
The conductor, Thomas Mayer, and
Donald Smith as Calaf in “Turandot”
orchestra also carry “The Flying Dutch-
man” to success. The “Dutchman” is
early Wagner, written at a time when
Italianate melodies and set arias had
not yet become anathema to him. It
is technically a very difficult opera to
stage, yet the staging here is one of
the best things the Trust has ever done.
The sheer mechanics of the arrival of
the Dutchman’s ship are brilliantly
devised, and executed with complete
success. Wendy Dickson’s designs are
(with the possible exception of the
vital portrait) beautiful, appropriate,
and eminently serviceable, a rare com-
bination which is admirably backed by
the excellent production of Kurt
Hommel.
“The Flying Dutchman’s” success will
always depend on the singer who leads
the cast. In Raymond Myers one can
see the makings of a great Dutchman,
indeed. Neil Warren Smith backs him
ably as Daland, and Robin Gordon (a
fine quavering Emperor in “Turandot”)
makes much of the steersman.
Unfortunately, the rest of the cast
lets the production down. Gino Zan-
canaro tries hard as Erik. He looks well
in a most un-Nordic fashion, but cannot
overcome the limitations of his Italian
voice. The only “star” import of the
season, Marcella Reale, is little better.
Miss Reale is big in every way: in size,
in face, in bust, in voice. In a local
artist her failings could be excused on
the grounds of economy. Whoever was
responsible for transporting her 12,000
miles to these shores should be sentenced
to attending every performance she
gives.
Morag Beaton... a fine Turandot
Music
On his own
By DAVID SALTER
Nicanor Zabaleta, harp. Town Hall,
Sydney.
THE NASTY THING about standard
modern virtuosi is that there are so
many of them. Gone are the days when
Paganini, Liszt, Melba, Chaliapin, or
Dragonetti were so pre-eminent that
they were taken as synonyms for their
instrument or vocal range. Fortunately,
this outgrowth of modern mass com-
munication systems has not yet over-
taken the less-favored members of the
orchestral family. If you are a Segovia,
Rampal, or (at least in the ’twenties
and ’thirties) Casals, you are it and the
second rankers in your field are little


more than a distraction. Such is the
case with Zabaleta.
To watch him breeze through the
Prokofiev Prelude Opus 12, No. 7
difficult enough on the piano —is
to observe an artist so completely in
command of his instrument that one
simply stops thinking about technique
as part of the performance. Certainly
nothing looked easy, but then again,
the lustrous cascades of sound he pro-
duced were mesmeric in their perfect
beauty. Zabaleta, unlike many fringe-
area virtuosi, plays the music as well
as he plays the notes.
The program progressed more or
less chronologically from Bach to the
20th century, giving an interesting
exposition of the little-known harp
literature. Included was the small set
of six variations on a Swiss Air (Op.
183), the only Beethoven work which
gives the harp as an alternative to the
piano or harpsichord. One feels sure
that the piece earned its position in
Zabaleta’s repertoire solely because it
is Beethoven; as an example of one of
the composer’s favorite forms it is dis-
mally unimaginative. But there was
much fine music throughout the evening
and an unbroken stream of memorable
performances.
Even in the now hackneyed “Mala-
guena” of Albeniz, Zabaleta projected
his instrument as a distinctive voice,
drawing on resources of textural varia-
tion quite foreign to one’s concept of
the standard harp range. While much of
this could be the expression of his
technical mastery withering runs
and arpeggios, quite complex homo-
phonic passages and rapid figuration
the interpretative depth and musician-
ship evident in each item of the pro-
gram spoke more for a profound artistry.
It was this consistently fine level of
performance in such a variety of works
which saved the concert from becoming
what many people (judging from the
poor attendance) feared a cloying
run-through of the titbits of the popu-
lar virtuoso’s show pieces.
Films
Salt of the earth
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Family Way. Directors, John and
Roy Boulting.
Caprice. Director, Frank Tashlin.
“THE FAMILY WAY” begins decep-
tively with preparations for a wedding
in a north country industrial town.
Everyone is pretty if young, worthy and
comic if out of their twenties, heart-
warming at any age. The spectator
settles back comfortably to the mild
enjoyment of one of those amiable
sentimental comedies about the British
working class.
But the audience, it soons turns out,
has been neatly conned. Certainly it
is often a very funny film, with an
unerring instinct for the comic look
and sound of ordinary living, but under-
neath it is tough and realistic the
most truthful and touching English
movie since “Billy Liar” or “A Kind
Of Loving.” As the script removes
layer after layer of their defences, the
characters lose their stock, true-blue
appearance and emerge as complex
human beings, comprehensible but not
always admirable. Salt of the earth they
may be, but the directors see to it that
the salt often stings sharply as it is
rubbed into some of our concealed
wounds.
The bridegroom of the wedding group,
a sensitive youth somewhat out of
place in his argumentative, gregarious
family, is stricken on his wedding night
with impotence. Hardly surprising,
since he has been pestered all day by
the rorty jokes of family and friends,
has to spend his wedding night
separated from his parents’ bedroom
by a cardboard-thin wall, and has to
endure a fit of helpless giggles from his
bride when the bed (rigged by some
facetious friends) collapses. The couple’s
honeymoon plans fall through, and as
they continue their almost communal
family existence, the boy’s incapacity
continues, aggravated by the tensions
of family life and his own worry and
humiliation.
Ample opportunities here for a snig-
gering, elbow-in-the-ribs treatment, but
this is brilliantly avoided by script, dir-
ectors, and cast. They don’t make the
mistake of treating the story solemnly
after all, one of the most tragic
things about the couple’s problem is
that it really is comic but they
recognise clearly the emotional strain
of all the characters involved. You
start off laughing, but you may end
up as I did having a furtive blow of
the nose before the lights go up.
It is particularly pleasing to see a
film like this from the Boulting brothers,
who have always been sharply intelli-
gent film makers but of late have been
increasingly waspish, treating the
targets of their humor with rather off-
putting superiority. Here, without being
patronising, they have identified them-
selves with their characters as does
Schlesinger at his best, sympathising
with their troubles because they’re
human, not because they’re working-
class battlers.
In a cast of uniform excellence it is
hardly fair to single out individual
performances. Hayley Mills proves her
maturity as an actress, but the thunder
is perhaps stolen by John Mills and
Marjorie Rhodes, as her parents-in-
law, who give a deeply touching and
richly humorous picture of a marriage
which survives because it is based not
only on disillusionment and disappoint-
ment but on love. In fact they and
the whole movie • —■ show us the sort
of family, brawling, independent, and
irreverent, that the trumped-up TV
series “Till Death Us Do Part” thinks
it is presenting.
One doesn’t expect deep emotion,
recognisable human behaviour, or even
a very coherent plot from a Doris
Day movie like “Caprice,” but surely
one is entitled to be diverted. This one
not only has a plot with involvements
I didn’t even want to follow, it is ugly
to look at and directed with dogged
effort by Frank Tashlin. Doris Day is
unbecomingly dressed and abominably
made-up; the film’s few jokes are
elderly and are dragged in protesting
by the scruff of their necks. Tashlin’s
reputation as a comedy director has
always seemed to me undeserved, but
he used to turn out pleasant, unassuming
trifles; this over-decorated effort is
without redeeming features.
Theatre
Warmed-up "Soup"
By PHILLIP ADAMS
There’s a Girl in my Soup. Terence
Frisby. Comedy, Melbourne.
BIG BOX-OFFICE in Sydney and an
even better response in Melbourne seem
to have assured that “Soup” will be
returning to Sydney for seconds. The
play may not be a success, but there’s
no denying it’s a hit.
The author’s successful recipe in-
cludes ingredients of “Two for the See-
saw,” a pinch of “Cactus Flower,” and
a hint of “The Knack.” To these must
be added the presence of a leading
lady who is all eyes and thighs, a lead-
ing man with fading traces of Holly-
wood charisma, and a producer who
knows his onions.
The play concerns a glamorous TV
gourmet who faces, with growing dis-
quiet, the just desserts of approaching
middle-age. His qualms are greatly
magnified when a popsie appears in his
flat who finds him utterly resistible.
Worse still, she eludes his grasp not out
of any concern for her chastity (morally
she’s mod) but because she finds him
a sexual anachronism.
Occasionally he rallies and rushes at
her with another burst of Rock Hud-
son romantacism, only to be rejected
by her Rita Tushingham matter-of-
factness. Ron Randell ambles amiably
through his part, while Amanda Reiss
counterpoints with extravagant over-
statement. She delivers her lines with-
out punctuation or modulation in a
relentless, bovine monotone, while phy-
sically she contorts all over the stage
like the suffering half of an adagio
team. Her characterisation, more than
improbable, is grotesque. Yet, through.
Miss Reiss’ sheer energy and daring,
it comes off almost brilliantly.
Ray Taylor contributes a good per-
formance as Randell’s editor, and Kerry
Francis is splendid as a hung-over
young drummer. Robert Chetwyn, who
also directed the London production,
gets more out of the play than Frisby
put into it, somehow creating the illu-
sion that the play is naughty. In fact,
on the rare occasions that Frisby is
blue, he’s more duck-egg than navy.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Set reasonably fair for
overseas trading
THERE IS NO NEED to fuss about
the swing from a $6l million surplus
to a balance of payments deficit of
$125 million for 1966-67 that was
announced at the weekend. It looks big,
but it means little in the circumstances
of what is happening on the Australian
overseas trading front. For the deficit
was due entirely to a fall in capital
inflow and looks like being at least
made up by the rise in exports as the
big raw material developments in iron
ore and bauxite get into a higher gear
this year. And after that there are pros-
pects of continuing additions to export
income as the proceeds of the mining
developments make their increasing
impact on the payments position.
The previous year’s favorable trade
balance of $6l m. had been due only to
a sudden rush of foreign capital to
Australia in an attempt to beat the
U.K. restrictions on capital exports
that were imposed later on in that
year. It was despite a trade deficit of
$193 million.
In the latest year, current account
dealings showed a marked improve-
ment as exports jumped by $3ll mil-
lion, while imports rose by only $23
million and “invisibles” showed a $67
million rise in their net deficit. So the
net deficit on current account of $655
million was an improvement of $221
million from the previous year, with
the rise in exports to a record $2940
million far exceeding the increase in
imports to $2845 million, to leave a
trade surplus of $95 million. It was
only the slump in net apparent capital
inflow by $407 million to $530 million
that caused what looks like a temporary
loss in reserves. The result of all this
was that Australia’s total international
Port Hedland: more iron ore exports to come
reserves declined by $l7B million a
better result than earlier forecasts of a
drop of around $2OO million.
One notable feature of the way the
foreign reserves of $1198.3 million were
split up is that an increasing proportion
is being held in gold and dollars rather
than in sterling, following what appears
to have been a conscious rearrangement
by the Reserve Bank (aided, of course,
by the fact that sterling is generally the
more flexible part of the reserves and
generally has a disproportionate fall
when the reserves decline). But the
June 30 gold holding, which was up to
$204 million, clearly reflects a policy
of holding an increasing amount of
local gold output.
Bird watching
A job for chairmen
COMPANY CHAIRMEN should watch
out or at any rate follow the sport of
bird-watching, at least according to U.S.
management man Dr. Harold Koontz,
now on an enlightening mission to Mel-
bourne’s business world. He suggests
they should watch for certain birds in
particular. One of the species is the
“after luncheon napper,” who finds the
board a comfortable place to dream.
Another is “the duckbilled double-
talker,” who straddles every issue by
talking out of both sides of its mouth.
Next, “the red-tailed bandwagon
jumper.” We know the type well. He
stays on the fence, says Dr. Koontz,
until he sees how the decision is going
and then jumps merrily on the band-
wagon.
The list is extensive, others on it
being the “white-breasted nut hatcher”
and the “full-breasted recording secre-
tary,” who carefully takes notes while
members are carefully taking note of
her.
More seriously, Koontz believes that
a board should have a balance of
“insiders” and “outsiders” so it is not
just a managing director’s executive
committee.
Wool auctions
Support from trade
WITH ALL THE NOISE and bother
created by efforts to get a reserve price
scheme for wool here in recent years
and the awful present experience of the
one in N.Z., with its huge build-up of
stocks of low-quality wools overhanging
an unwilling world market, it is salu-
tary that the National Council of Wool
Selling Brokers and also the Inter-
national Wool Textile Organisation last
week confirmed their support of the
auction system and condemned sugges-
tions both for acquisition and reserve
price schemes. The trade was most
reluctant to tamper with the auction
system. Mr. Dunstan, the president of
the NCWSB, admitted that members
were even divided on his organisation’s
conservative proposals for a new free-
enterprise marketing body in which
growers would have the opportunity to
participate in a management to com-
prise three growers, three buyers, and
three brokers.
Mr. Dunstan, a top executive of
Dalgety and N.Z. Loan, admitted
brokers were wrapped up in the auction
system, but he genuinely believes that
it also serves growers and buyers best
and as a “delicately balanced
mechanism it shouldn’t be disturbed too
much.” Be this as it may, it is true, as
he says, that there are no short-cuts to
economic survival for wool and those
depending on it.
Elsewhere the question has been asked
whether it would be advisable to dis-
continue July wool sales, which were
introduced in 1960 and have had the
effect of undermining the entire price
structure of the industry. In six of the
years since July sales were started, the
prices of Australian medium-quality
merino wool have been lower, type for
type, than the level ruling at the end
of the previous month and have twice
remained unchanged.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economyS The balance of payments deficit for
1966-67 turned out to be sl2sm. against the previous year’s
credit balance of s6lm. . . . Total international reserves
dropped back sl7Bm. to $1198.3m., while net capital inflow
was s4o7m. less at ss3om. . . . On current account, exports
($2940m.) finished s9sm. ahead of imports ($2845m.); with
invisibles, the 1966-67 deficit of $655m. contrasted with
1965-66’s sB76m.
In 1966-67 savings bank deposits went up by $5l lm., nearly
10 percent, to $5764.7m.
For the markets: Leader support has widened to
strengthen more industrials on Australian share markets.
Miners are somewhat less decisive, especially base metals.
Fairly quiet and selective buying in London held trading
firm . . . Wall Street managed to go up a little, mainly stirred
by the second-liners.
For companies : The seasonal trickle has started to
swell . . . Right in the mainstream, Australian Paper Manu-
facturers came up with a practically steady profit, $7,369,648,
compared with 1965-66’s $7,375,729, to give an 11.6 percent
earning rate (previously 12.7 percent) ... In a related field,
Fibre Containers sent up dividend from 12 to 15 percent as
profit leapt by 40 percent to $517,694; its companion in the
abstruse British Tobacco takeover play, Dodge Consolidated,
saw earnings slip back percent over the six months to
April.
A rush of financiers is, as usual, led by Australian
Guarantee’s brilliance; here profits advanced 15.23 percent
to $6,352,516 on net receivables up by $14.9m. to $265.5m.
and 15 percent is paid on a 26.5 percent earning rate . . .
Custom Credit also jumped up by about 15 percent to a
peak $3,457,790, with gross receivables adding slsm. to
touch $193.3m. ... A good second half allowed CAGA to
make a 6| percent earnings advance to $2,118,058; net
receivables were s4m. higher at sl2om. . . . Network Finance
showed a 33.4 percent gain to $425,131, helped by interest
savings, and pays an unchanged 8 percent ... A one-for-two
issue at 100 percent premium is to raise $6,016,973 for
Associated Securities; the Royal Bank of Scotland and
British Wagon will take up only what can be financed by
selling their rights.
The largest operator in the short-term money market,
Capel Court Securities, brought profit from $309,425 to
$464,914.
On the heavier side, Australia and Kandos Cement sold
slightly less, yet achieved 24J percent more profit at
$2,470,181; directors speak of entering into “contractural
marketing arrangements,” not traditionally a feature of the
industry . . . Pioneer Concrete is also ready to deal with this
situation.
Builder-developer Lend Lease Corporation moves dividend
from 10 to 11 percent after a 10 percent rise in profit to
$1,523,658; tax is more than doubled . . . Construction group
Paynter and Dixon lifts dividend, too, from 16 to 17 percent.
A one-for-four bonus issue and a one-for-eight cash issue
at par arrive from haulier and engineer Brambles; the year’s
profit ascended $111,668 to $1,951,575 and dividend stays
15 percent. The post-issue dividend is forecast at 12 percent.
Cox Bros.’ top-class Melbourne store Georges will become
public again on top of its sale to an independent company.
Fertiliser makers have an expected newcomer in Esso
Standard Oil (Australia) . . . Some 30 percent additional
Australian equity will be offered by Austral-Pacific Fertilisers
when it attains profitability in about two or three years.
MAN AND MATTERS
SIXTEEN YEARS AGO Mr. D. J. C.
Sutherland started the Australian
operation of Miles Laboratories, the
Alka-Seltzer and Clinitest people, and
under his direction as general manager
developed it into one of the leading
suppliers of a wide variety of phar-
maceutical products here. He has now
been rewarded for the achievement by
getting the top job at the British parent
company, itself an offshoot of the
American one. One of the perks of
the new job is that he will take over
the park and roomy manor house at
Penn, in Buckinghamshire, adjoining
the Miles factory. A previous occupant
of the place pioneered Pennsylvania,
and in its precincts Thomas Gray wrote
the “Elegy in a Country Churchyard,”
all a far cry from the firm’s Australian
headquarters in Collingwood and the
modest Melbourne bayside home
Sutherland has been occupying these
many years.
Sutherland migrated here from Eng-
land with his family just after the
war and, still only 38, returns home
with a large family of his own. He
started out at Melbourne University to
be a doctor like his father, but illness
and financial setbacks made him give
up the course. He then turned to the
next best thing, the pharmaceutical
industry, of which he has been a lead-
ing figure for many years and on the
council of the Australian Pharma-
ceutical Industry Association. At Penn,
with its 500 employees, he will com-
mand one of this international group’s
major manufacturing complexes and
see that its share of the $6 million or
more a year Miles put into research in
the pain-relieving business is spent to
good purpose.
FOR BUSINESSMEN who like to get
away from the rat race once in a while
to take stock of where they are head-
ing, the oak-panelled sanctum that is
the Assembly Hall, next to Scots
Church, in Collins Street, is just the
place. Its reverential atmosphere was
entirely suited to the now-concluded
weekly “Living With Legislation”
series put on by the local secretarial
and accountancy bodies.
Last week they had 45-year-old Mr.
R. M. Bannerman, our first Trade
Practices Commissioner, a sort of
guardian of the public interest, as he
put it when talking on the Trade
Practices Act, which, just about a year
after his appointment, is to be promul-
gated on September 1. The Assembly
Hall was obviously a haven for him
after his recent roistering across the
D. J. Sutherland
R. M. Bannerman.
i an d to acquaint the business world of
what the Act has in store for them,
With a whole new Act to administer
and a fee of $15,000 as his annual
reward for doing it, he seemed perfectly
happy with the prospect of living with
his particular bit of legislation. Business-
men may feel otherwise.

THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Has the Treasurer
expanded
credit too far?
BY J. C. HORSFALL
GIVE OR TAKE a million or two,
last year the Federal Treasurer met his
broad Budget objective in terms of net
increase in Governmental indebtedness
(the now accepted measure of its impact
on the economy). As noted here last
week, this was achieved in similar
manner to that chosen by Mr. Holt
in 1958-59, when in his first year as
Treasurer. It involved, in effect, heavy
reliance on trading bank finance in part
substitution for borrowing on Treasury
bills from the Reserve Bank, so that less
of the increase in indebtedness took
the shape of a Budget deficit and the
latter turned out to be only half of
the original $270 million estimate. All
this was done in the context of a vigor-
ous expansion of the volume of credit
by the trading banks, but without any
reduction in official interest rates kept
rigid to serve the Treasurer’s purposes
in the loan market.
In the prevailing circumstances of
strength in the big income generators
(with the notable exception of capital
inflow), one would have expected the
mixture of the heavy increase in Gov-
ernmental net indebtedness and the
general expansion of trading bank
credit to have given a decided impetus
to the economy, as indeed it did, even
if its full effects have still to be felt.
One would also have expected that, by
this stage in the pump-priming process,
the monetary authorities would be
thinking of tapering it off.
For instance, after discounting end-
of-the-fiscal-year influences, one might
have expected the June banking figures
to have shown some mild braking in
credit expansion. But there was no sign
of it. Nor, going on the retention of
previous terms (with the exception of
a slight stiffening in the shorts) in the
latest Commonwealth Loan, is there
any hint of any current tightening of
monetary policy. This might suggest
that the Budget is being cast in a similar
monetary policy framew r ork to that
wdiich served the Treasurer’s purpose
so well last year. One would trust this
is not so.
In other words, is a reflationary
monetary policy to be continued despite
the evidence that a further stimulus
from this or any other source looks
very risky in the emerging economic
circumstances? The economy has moved
out of the doldrums it was in this time
last year, when it sorely needed a
stimulus. A booster was then entirely
feasible, despite the likelihood of a big
drop in international reserves. Well, it
was given, and, surprisingly, continues
with a hard core of Government financ-
ing still relying heavily on credit crea-
tion. The Treasurer seems further out
on a credit limb than he should be or
is prudent for the orderly progress of
the economy as a whole.
In retrospect, monetary policy placed
too much emphasis on the expansion of
credit to the neglect of reductions in
official interest rates last year. If
official interest rates had been reduced,
and less emphasis placed on expanding
the volume of credit, the authorities
could more easily have increased them
with positive effect now. Of course com-
mercial rates tended to soften under
pressure from the plethora of credit
during last year, but, presumably for
reasons associated with the Treasurer’s
determination to wring all he could
from the loan market, official rates
were kept high and rigid. What has
happened to flexibility in monetary
policy? If the formula of liberal lend-
ing at high interest rates was a most
palatable one for the trading banks, it
also suited Mr. McMahon admirably.
Coupled with the inflexible bond rates,
it helped him to get twice as much as
he first estimated (for public consump-
tion, anyway) from the loan market
and in the roll-up there was a decided
stirring in economic momentum.
In its recent economic survey, the
Government showed no concern about
this at all. Yet I’ll be surprised if Dr.
Coombs doesn’t address himself to the
subject in his imminent annual report.
The abrupt jump in the rate of increase
in consumer prices in the June quarter
should be warning enough to take stock
of the position. Inflation is a sure by-
product of excess credit expansion. If
one throws in something for the built-
up, and also new, cost pressures, the
possibility of a credit squeeze looms up.
It would get decidedly closer, one might
suggest, if Mr. McMahon eschews strong
fiscal measures in the Budget in the
spirit of his “no tax increases if I can
help it” message of a few months ago.
I would have thought the sensible
thing to do here and now would be to
take a few cautionary steps, not only
on the credit front through the usual
Reserve Bank urging stricter lending
restraint, but perhaps also by increasing
official interest rates. At the very least
there should be a tough Budget.
It is not inconsistent to argue that a
more moderate increase in the volume
of credit last year should have been
accompanied by lower interest rates. If
that had been the mixture, the authori-
ties would now be in a stronger position
to apply credit containment on the
above lines, coupled with a strong
Budget, without too much disruption in

Men who prefer only the finest pipe tobacco, smoke Amphora. And for
good reason. Tobacco specialists in Holland select the world’s choicest
tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed and
blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent. And
downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s Australia’s
leading imported pipe tobacco and there are three blends to suit all tastes.

the economy. It is generally agreed that
if, in July, 1959, such steps had been
taken before speculative fever gripped
the economy, and if in August that
year the Government hadn’t brought
down another deficit Budget, the
economy would have been saved the
excesses of boom and the corrective
measures of 1960.
Bringing down another deficit Budget
in August, 1959, coupled with the
Reserve Bank’s failure to increase inter-
est rates and/or tell the trading banks
to restrict their lending, gave the all-
clear for the subsequent upsurge in
private fixed investment, which topped
off the 1960 boom mixture. Only when
the damage had been done, in its “Aus-
tralian Economy 1960,” did the Gov-
ernment admit that toward the end of
1959 it was disturbed at the uprush of
private fixed investment. By failing to
take restraining credit and fiscal meas-
ures many months earlier, it had
missed the opportunity to prevent it.
No doubt there would have been a sub-
stantial rise in private fixed investment
toward the end of 1959 even had some
monetary containment steps been taken
in the middle of that year. But as there
were none, we can’t say. The tragedy
was that it w'as not until December,
1959, that the Reserve Bank sent its
first restraint message to the trading
banks; even that w'as a mild one (in
1958-59 it had been strongly urging
them to expand their advances, which
they did, as in 1966-67). By then the
fat was in the fire. In fact, almost from
the time the message of restraint w ? as
delivered, bank advances began to
accelerate and, given no fiscal action to
temper it until the Budget in August,
1960, the boom went on its merry way.
Mr. McMahon has an obvious and
unpalatable duty to perform in the
Budget. As for increasing bank lend-
ing rates and telling the trading banks
to pull in their credit horns at this
stage, time would seem to be of the
essence. One thing is certain, if prices
go on rising in the June quarter at
some higher rate, increases in official
interest rates would progressively lose
their effectiveness as containment
measures a point of theory nicely
summarised by J. O. N. Perkins in the
new edition of his “Anti-cyclical Policy
in Australia,” published last week by
Melbourne University Press. Examining
the 1960 boom (the book now takes
us up to 1966), he says, inter alia, that
“in periods of inflationary expectations
the prospects for a high money rate
of profits appear exceeding strong and
money that can be borrowed at a
nominal rate of, say, five percent,
appears therefore to be almost without
real cost; the conclusion must be that a
small but significant rise in those interest
rates under official control is preferable
before inflationary expectations get a
grip.”

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
A buying spree:
Hamersley and
two other Hs
“HE TOLD ME to buy this stock for
my old age. He was right! After hold-
ing it for a month I was an old man.”
This was the sort of comment going
around in 1961 and again in 1965. It
won’t (except for a few reckless cases)
be going around this 12 months. The
year just ended, as sneak-previewed by
the interim reports, should prove a good
one. On the Sydney Exchange, 593
interim results out of 913 were im-
proved, while 63 more were steady.
Not much happened with dividends,
though. Only 90 of them went up and
774 stayed steady. If this trend con-
tinues with the finals it will be a case
of fatter portfolios but static dividend
accounts. Perhaps directors will feel
surer of themselves later in the current
year, which also looks encouraging, and
will kick dividends along then. All the
local seers, including the Government
and the banks, have already predicted
that 1967-68 will see us getting closer
to an economic “Lotus Land.”
Being cheered by these predictions,
and being quite rich this week with over
$3OOO in kitty, I decided to go on a
buying spree. A few weeks ago I was
keen on the. three Ms; this week it’s the
three H.s.
The first H is for Hamersley. The
company’s June report makes its pros-
pectus predictions seem super-coy. The
current price has the same effect as the
price most stags originally rejoiced in
getting. And, in my opinion, the price
spiral has only just begun. Here’s
why.
The annual selling capacity of 10
million tons of iron ore originally
scheduled for 1972 will now be reached
next year. The loss the company was
supposed to have incurred between
August and December last year turned
up as a half-million dollar profit instead.
Now, for good measure, a profit of over
$3 million has been earned in the first
half of this year; the company’s modest
directors have forecast even better things
for the second half. To cap the whole
thing off, there are now rumored re-
ports of a new $6O million contract to
supply iron ore to West Germany. All
this was enough for me to be bullish
to the extent of 400 shares. My goal
here is a ten percent profit which, with
the excitement and shortage of scrip in
the mining sector, I expect to see by the
time of the next quarterly report.
The second H is for Howard Smith.
I’m buying this stock as a cheap “in”
to BHP. It holds 1.27 million BHP
shares which, in rough terms, means
that each Howard Smith shareholder is
entitled to one-eighth of a BHP share.
BHP’s interests are well known and
wide, its potential is massive and its
board, though not noted for generosity,
may now even feel magnanimous
enough to give some sort of handout
to shareholders. Its shares, even at
around $lO, still look light on.
Taking the BHP element out of
Howard Smith shares, you are left with
the rest of its activities including
engineering, sugar, and shipping, which
are all doing well being valued at
only twice par value. This seems un-
reasonable. Doubly so when you re-
member that this year’s profit will get
an added boost from the $5.8 million
coal loader the company built in New-
castle last year. Apparently the loader
wasn’t quite completed by the end of
1966, so the directors decided not to
take any profits on it. The result is
that this year got the full profit and
will be charged with very few of the
expenses involved.
The last H is really a bit of a fraud.
It stands for Honey. This is how I
would describe the girl who does the
Linda ad on TV. I must explain that
I’m not buying Ralta Holdings, the
company which makes Linda products,
for its enjoyable advertising, but be-
cause I think its newly listed shares
are being under-rated. In view of the
increasing production figures being
turned up by the Statistician for elec-
tric blankets, I think Ralta shares are
worth something in excess of 60 cents.
I hope so. I bought 300.

Some heartening results from
the finance companies
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
THEY HAVEN’T BEEN a bad lot of
company results so far. Only a few
dividend rises, but plenty of profit lifts.
These early results are generally
heavily larded with finance company
profits, and they seem to have kept
within striking distance of a 15 percent
or so profit rise. But in an industry
where money is the stock in trade there
is an understandable reluctance to hand
out more of it to shareholders.
The greatest benefits that share-
holders can expect from this industry
at present seem to be in scrip issues;
Associated Securities is making another
one-for-two at 100 percent premium,
which brings a theoretical benefit of
about 25 cents a share to those who sell
their rights. For as business expands
(and it certainly is doing that) there
are going to be continued new share
issues in order to maintain borrowing
ratios.
The latest good results suggest that
if the hire-purchase companies can do
so well at a time when there is so much
money about, when the banks are offer-
ing personal loans, when savings bank
deposits are at remarkable heights, and
when motor registrations are well below
their peak, then they should do even
better when money gets a bit tighter
(it must do so sooner or later). On top
of all this, there have been the incur-
sions into their field by offshoots of
the motor vehicle makers themselves,
The coming of foreign banks like the
Hong Kong and Shanghai and the
Chartered Bank into this field, by
taking a large slice of Australian
operators, has gingered the competition
U P a bit, too.
True, the cost of borrowing the
funds they use is cheaper in times of
flush liquidity. But it is times like these
that the lending boot is on the wrong
foot as far as they are concerned. In
this business, it is better to be sought
after for loans than have to go looking
for business. And in recent times, the
finance houses have had to go looking
f° r much of their turnover,
When things get a little tighter in the
economy, a lot of good quality
borrowers who cannot be accommo-
dated by the banking system find their
way into the hire-purchase companies—•
and some of the less secure borrowers,
on whom they rely during flush times,
find themselves unable to get past the
door. So the quality of business done
by finance houses is generally better
when liquidity is a bit tight and
so bad debts are reduced.
Although much is being made of the
fact that finance companies are in-
creasingly using personal loans as a
method of financing credit sales in-
stead of hire purchase (and so many
personal loans are simply another form
of hire-purchase operation), the fact
remains that there has been a genuine
and substantial swing out of this field
into leasing and other forms of financ-
ing. Some companies even play the
bond market and with striking
success.
PROBABLY the most heartening of all
the finance company results so far was
the 14.9 percent lift from Custom
Credit, which brought group net profit
to within striking distance of the $3.45
million boom time (and it was later
shown, inaccurate) profit of 1960. It
has been a long struggle back for
Custom Credit, and shareholders may
have hoped that this year directors
could have felt sufficiently confident
with the result to pay more in dividends
out of the 23.6 percent earning rate
than the 10 percent they decided to
continue.
This caution may stem from the
fact that almost 40 percent of Custom
Credit’s profit lift came from its insur-
ance subsidiary rather than its finance
operations, and it could be that direc-
tors want to have a better look at the
finance end of the business before doing
anything to restore the dividend even
part of the way to the 15 percent that
ruled some years ago when earning
rate was well below what it is today.
If so, it seems unlikely that they will
be able to hold out against a dividend
rise in the current financial year. For
the company’s efficiency seems to be
improving as the 11 percent rise in
finance net profit followed a rise in
gross receivables of only eight percent.
The Chartist says:
DUNLOP AUSTRALIA LTD. can now be classified as a promising recovery
situation. It is an excellent example of a trendline study, as investors who sold
about the $2.20 level on the break of the 35 percent uptrend, which had been
maintained from early 1962 until November, 1964, would have avoided considerable
erosion of capital, since prices eventually fell to a low point of $1.14. However,
the towntrend evident since 1964 has now been broken and already prices have
risen to $1.70. It is quite likely that a short-term reaction hack to the trendline
about $1.50 could be expected, but the base consolidation suggests a recovery
eventually close to the $2.30-$2.40 level, where there would be considerable resistance
selling from the 1964 top formation. Last sale price on 25/7/67 $1.66.

IN CONTRAST to the industrial share
market, where news is generally heard
from the companies only a couple of
times a year, the mining market is
continually alive. Apart from the
regular monthly (or quarterly) produc-
tion reports that are issued, investors
are further able to supervise their hold-
ings in mining companies by reference
to the trends and fluctuations in metal
prices and progress reports from the
exploration activities.
Since this series was commenced, the
mining market has continued to forge
ahead, with the Sydney base metals
index being 10.6 percent higher at
1750.18 on July 21. Movements in share
prices in the companies reviewed are

Only Broken Hill South has failed
to appreciate in price recently and it
will be noted that this accords with
the slightly bearish conclusion reached
on this company. However, this position
could change dramatically, depending
on the outcome of tests on the com-
pany’s major phosphate discovery.
An important cause of the market
appreciations in the other companies’
share prices (and a reason, perhaps,
why Souths haven’t declined) is the
present silver situation. As from July
14, the U.S. Treasury abandoned its
fixed selling price for silver (previously
$U.5.1.29 per fine ounce, equivalent
to $A1.15 per ounce). This was
due to the rapidly diminishing
U.S. stockpile of silver, which has in
recent years been the major factor in
meeting the gap between world demand
for silver and world production. As was
mentioned in the article on Norths,
there have been growing indications that
that silver price would rise, particularly
from May, when the U.S. restricted
sales of silver at the fixed price to
those requiring the metal for essential
industrial use in the U.S.A.
Currently, the silver price on the
London Metal Exchange is around 156
pence sterling per troy ounce, having
touched a peak of 162 pence. At this
stage it is difficult to predict at what
level the silver price will settle down,
since it becomes profitable to melt down
silver coins in circulation at various
price levels in different countries. How-
ever, assuming a silver price of 150
pence sterling per ounce ($A1.56),
which represents an increase of around
40 cents Australian per ounce (or 35
percent) over prices realised in recent
years, the two local producers that
stand to benefit most are, in order,
North Broken Hill and New Broken
Hill. In quantitative terms, and on a
per share basis, North Broken Hill
would stand to gain additional revenue
of over seven cents in a full year, New
Broken Hill around six cents, Broken
Hill South around three cents, Mt.
Isa and EZ Industries around two
cents, and CRA over one cent.
This increase in the price of silver
could hardly have come at a more
opportune time for the companies
reviewed, since the immediate outlook
for leaid and zinc prices is not encourag-
ing, whilst in the long run it is uncer-
tain, particularly if Mt. Isa proceeds
with the development of its huge low-
grade deposits at MacArthur River.
Similarly, both Mt. Isa and Broken Hill
South face a likely declining copper
price in the near future. ____
Although Norths and New Broken
Hill stand to gain, per share, most from
the higher silver price, it is apparent
that the recent percentage gain in New
Broken Hill’s share price is considerably
higher than Norths. This is doubtless
due to the far more promising explora-
tion interests of New Broken Hill. Thus,
whilst Norths has little tangible yet to
show for its annual exploration expendi-
ture of over $500,000 (a figure, which
incidentally, is low in relation to the
exploration expenditure of the other
companies reviewed), New Broken Hill
has an interest in the Bougainville
copper/gold prospect and the Anaconda
nickel strike, via its one-third interest
in CRA’s exploration activities. Fur-
ther, as pointed out in the New Broken
Hill article, because of the company’s
modest capitalisation, far greater
“leverage” in these prospects, as well as
in any future discoveries, is obtained
by holding New Broken Hill rather
than by holding CRA. Consequently,
in the absence of any further report
from Anaconda, the course of New
Broken Hill’s share price is likely to be
determined largely by the nickel specu-
lator.
Similarly, the price trend of CRA
seems likely to be linked to that of
Hamersley’s in the near future. When
I wrote on CRA, 42J percent of its
share price of $8 was due to its 54
percent holding in Hamersley Holdings
Ltd., then priced at $5 per share.
Hamersley has subsequently risen to
$6.30 (due to growing indications that
the prospectus estimates are conser-
vatively based), which should have
added a further 88 cents to CRA’s
share price. At the current respective
prices of Hamersley and CRA, almost
50 percent of CRA’s price is now
due to Hamersley. However, just as
those investors interested in the Zinc
Corporation’s exploration activities will
prefer New Broken Hill to CRA,
so also will investors continue to buy
Hamersley direct rather than CRA
“for its Hamersley interest.” Direct
maximisation of interest per share
seems to be the keynote in mining com-
pany investment.
EZ Industries was the other company
reviewed which has yet to announce any
major new discovery, despite its current
exploration expenditure of over
$750,000 annually. On the other hand,
it is now generally realised that EZ’s
own mines on the west coast of Tas-
mania are a far more valuable asset
than thought earlier. Considerably in-
creased tonnages of high-grade ore have
been proven and the company is to sink
a second shaft to exploit them. In due
course, when profits flow, this mine-
expansion program, EZ could well be
promoted from the ranks of an indus-
trial stock to that of a miner!
The recent rise of Mt. Isa’s shares
to near the $4 mark seems to have
been due solely to the silver price rise.
This will provide some welcome relief
until the K 57 shaft provides access to
higher-grade copper ore at the Mt.
Isa mine, whilst it is a bull point for
the economics of the MacArthur River
deposits. In addition, once Mt. Isa’s
expansion program becomes fully effec-
tive, a further five million ounces of
silver could be added to production,
making the company easily the largest
Australian silver producer. On a per
share basis, however, Norths and New
Broken Hill will continue to be the
most important silver producers.
In conclusion, of the six companies
reviewed, New Broken Hill has possibly
the most attractive medium-term pros-
pects and Mt. Isa possibly the best
long-term prospects (provided the
MacArthur River deposits are proved
economic). Each company, though, does
have investment merits in its own right,
even at current levels.


The Chartist in support
Technical grounds
for confidence
THE BASE METAL stocks under re-
view would certainly have proved
more rewarding for investors when
compared with the general performance
of industrials since 1960. Mt. Isa would
be the only stock where longer-term
investors would be showing some
erosion of capital. The overall picture
suggests that considerable growth is
still likely in this group but, as with
all “fast moving” situations, they should
be closely followed for a reversal of
trend. Investors should continue to
have confidence in Australia’s mineral
wealth, if only on technical grounds.
BROKEN HILL SOUTH was
recommended while the stock was
trading around the $3 level in Novem-
ber, 1966, and prices have already
been as high as $3.85 this year. The
steeper intermediate trend rate of
approximately 60 percent from the
middle of 1962 until the break early
1965 was followed by a sideways or
neutral trend until it became evident
that a new uptrend, although only at
a slower rate of appreciation of 20
percent per annum, was forming. The
stock can be safely held while it
remains above $2.60 in the short term,
but projections of $4.80 and a more
optimistic target of $5.50 for the
longer term are indicated. Last sale
price on 25/7/67 $3.55.
E.Z. INDUSTRIES LTD. tended to
follow the LME zinc price until late
1965 and prices had moved up to the
resistance level around $2.60 in 1960,
1964, and again in 1966, when it did
appear that the stock was more
“bullish” than “bearish.” However, a
decisive break in the flatter 15 percent
uptrend occurred in March of this
year and a low point of $2.07 was
recorded. At this point a remarkable
reversal of trend became evident and
the stock has already risen to $3.20 on
very high volume, breaking the strong
resistance levels around $2.60. The
base consolidation suggests that prices
could eventually move up to around
the $4 level. Last sale price on 25/7/67
$2.94.
MT. ISA MINES LIMITED has
long been considered by both funda-
mentalists and investors as an outstand-
ing growth situation but, when com-
pared with the performance of several
other metal stocks under review, it can
only be regarded as mediocre. After
falling to $3.50 this year, it has rallied
to $4.02 recently and could be breaking
the intermediate downtrend held since
1966. It is still moving in a slight long-
term uptrend of a primary nature, but
has considerable resistance levels from
the 1964 and 1966 top formations. If
it does manage to move above the $4.90
level, a long-term objective of about
$9.00 would be a possibility. Last sale
price on 25/7/67 $3.94.
NEW BROKEN HILL has shown
considerable capital growth for investors
who entered near the commencement
of the 80 percent uptrend, which con-
tinued until May, 1965. However, after
a decline to $3.35, the upward trend
was resumed and a high of $5.50 was
recorded in the middle of 1966. The
consolidation pattern appeared “bear-
ish” until April of this year and $4.00
was the critical support level. Once
again a remarkable and spectacular
reversal occurred, accompanied by very
high volume, and prices have recently
been as high as $8.40 in an extremely
steep uptrend. The base consolidation
suggests that a longer-term move to
about $lO.OO would be possible,
although some short-term reaction could
be expected when one considers that a
1500 percent uptrend has been followed
for some weeks. Last sale price on
25/7/67 $8.20.
NORTH BROKEN HILL cannot
equal New Broken Hill in its market
performance since 1960 but, once again,
investors who entered this stock late'
1962 would have had a 102 percent
rate of appreciation until early 1964,
when a neutral trend prevailed above
the $3.20 level. It showed signs of
breaking a flatter trend in March,
1966, but a sudden reversal occurred
and heavy volume took prices above
the old resistance level and a high point
of $4.50 for the year has already been
recorded. There is some chance of a
reaction in the short term but a target
of close to $7.00 remains a possibility
for the longer term. Last sale price on
25/7/67 $5.14.

The Melbourne market
Footwear firms stepping high
THINGS SEEM TO BE stepping up
in the footwear industry. There don’t
appear to be so many of those Chinese
shoes around these days to knock the
cheaper end of the market, and the
competition among the dearer brands
does not seem quite as savage as it
was a year or so ago, as consumer
demand has picked up a fair bit. So
those shoemen that did well last year
can be expected to do even better this
year and those that did very badly
indeed (like International Footwear)
could be in for significant improve-
ments.
The situation at International seems
certain to be much better when its
results come out; last year’s liquidity
shortage, expansion problems, unex-
pected subsidiary losses and so on have
since been largely solved, so it should
not be too long before the company
gets back to dividends, even if it misses
out again this year. At only 33 cents,
there is plenty of scope for recovery in
International Footwear’s 50 cent shares.
The shares of rival Julius Marlow also
look fairly cheap at the 75-cent mark
to yield 7.3 percent. But even more
interesting are the shares in Clarks
Shoes Australia Ltd. (like Julius Mar-
low controlled from overseas, while
International is Australian-owned).
Current trading by Clarks Shoes is
leaving this South Australian-based
group favorably placed either to lift its
dividend or make a bonus issue. In its
five-year history on the Melbourne and
Adelaide lists it has never lifted its
annual distribution from ten percent.
Some sort of bonus issue should come
sooner or later—the next opportunity
for doing so would be within two
months.
Group profit in the year to
October 31 last was boosted from
$490,270 to a peak $576,950, and
represented 24.4 percent on capital. This
was achieved on a sales increase of
8J percent, most of which occurred
in the second half of the year. Accord-
ing to the interim report in June, both
sales and profit in the current year have
been rising even more rapidly. Sales
for the six months were boosted 20
percent, “and profits increased at a
higher rate.” Directors added that these
figures excluded the results of com-
panies taken over during the period.
Among these were Symco Engineering
Pty. Ltd., Starr Rubber Mills Pty. Ltd.
(both of S.A.), and a 60 percent in-
terest in Clarks Shoes New Zealand
Ltd. All were paid for in cash.
The sharply increased interim profit
was the result of cost savings which
followed the higher volume of sales
and benefits from the consolidation of
the children’s division. This took place
last year.
The high levels of operations and
profits of the first six months have con-
tinued into the current half, and group
sales for the year should exceed $l6
million. Group earnings should in-
crease substantially and will equal
about 35 percent on capital, giving
3£ times cover to the steady dividend.
This puts the company in a command-
ing position as far as a bonus issue is
concerned. A one-for-three or one-for-
four bonus will still leave it with more
than double cover for its ten percent
distribution.
HECLA’S ANNOUNCEMENT last
week of cash and bonus issues prompts
one to look less harshly on other manu-
facturers of electrical appliances, especi-
ally those who derive a large portion of
their revenue from the sale of electric
blankets. The recent debut of Ralta
Holdings Ltd. was markedly unspec-
tacular, but, with its fortunes at present
dependent on the rapidly selling line
of Linda blankets, the future could
make investors wish they had sat up and
taken an interest in this issue at present
levels.
The shares hit the market at 60 cents
on debut day, and after this initial burst
have settled at 54 cents. The forecast
dividend of eight percent gives the
issue a yield of 7.4 percent. The distri-
bution was covered twice by earnings
in 1966, but the group’s performance
in the current year to September 30
promises to increase this cover and
offers a definite chance of an increase
in dividend.
Linda electric blankets account for
most of the group’s business at present;
the growth in output of this item in the
past few years has been spectacular.
For 1963-64, output was 118,644 main
volt blankets; this was lifted 50 percent
in 1964-65, and a further 40 percent
in 1965-66, when it topped 238,000.
More important, though, is the fact
that in the nine months to March, 1966,
production was lifted 150 percent to
145,672, while in the same period to
March, 1967, output was boosted to
366,124 units.
Figures for 1965-66 show that with
the production increase of 40 percent,
earnings rose about 50 percent. Based
on this performance, with production
in the current year running at more
than double the previous level, profit
should show a colossal increase (pro-
vided things are not too difficult in its
New Zealand operation).
In this case, it is reasonable to hope
that dividend might be lifted from 8
to 10 percent, which, at current levels,
gives the shares a yield better than 9
percent. With a return as secure and
as high as this, sleeping wonderfully
warm with Linda would be a pleasure.
PRINTER, PACKAGER, and pub-
lisher Specialty Press has had a quiet
but extremely successful history on the
public lists since lan Potter & Co.
helped float the group off in 1951.
Shareholders have seen steady and
continued growth, mainly via share
issues. The rights to the latest issue,
a one-for-two at par, can currently
be bought for $1.20. With 50 cents
to pay on top of this the yield from
dividends is only about 3J percent
after brokerage, but the broking house
feels the rights are good buying be-
cause of the continued growth which
should be in store for the group.
Actually, Specialty may well be on
the average of one of its greatest
periods of growth. The group has just
moved into New Zealand through two
acquisitions; it will be printing in that
country and has not merely acquired
a marketing set-up, which is so often
the case with expansion away from
home. The new issue will help to
finance the move.
The new shares will rank for divi-
dends from the 1967-68 year, expected
to be maintained at percent. There
should be no difficulty in doing this.
Specialty is one of the few companies
to have lifted profit every year in the
19605, in 1965-66 the payout was
covered more than three times by 40.2
percent earnings on capital. Indications
are that profits rose again in 1966-67;
if the trend continues this year, divi-
dends should be covered at least twice
on the higher capital.

Mining
Thiess is more than
a nickel boom
IN THE MIDST of the mining boom
Thiess Holdings Ltd. has been receiving
a lot of attention and speculators have
been very ready to push the market
price up in the hope that a lease held by
the company some 50-odd miles from
Kambalda could contain some nickel.
The company is in fact exploring for
coal, and this lease is one of several
held in Western Australia. It has been
looking for coal in the Kimberleys for
about two years in an attempt to find
extensive deposits which would find a
ready market in any future steel plant
in that area.
Thiess has other leases in the Kim-
berlevs where it is investigating the
possibilities for salt extraction. In addi-
tion to these prospecting activities, the
company’s engineering section is be-
coming further established in the West
and is working on the standardisation of
the railway from Perth to Kalgoorlie.
The company’s shares have been
very eagerly sought in the past few
weeks, to rise from $1.73 at June 30
to close to $2. This rise could be due
to a number of factors. Certainly last
year’s record profit of $1.6 million,
equivalent to over 42 percent on the
company’s capital, looks like being
exceeded in the year just past. Profits
for the December half-year were well
in excess of the previous corresponding
period and this higher trend was con-
tinuing when the interim report was
issued earlier in March this year.
This higher profit would include
increased royalties from higher sales
of coal to Japan by Thiess-Peabody-
Mitsui Pty. Ltd. The interest held by
Thiess in this coal export operation
provides another reason for the strong
demand for Thiess shares. At this stage
there does not appear to be any dra-
matic change in contracts held or
profits, but even if the recent market
rise is not justified by any new events,
its optimism will probably not go un-
rewarded, given twelve months or so.
As described in The Bulletin of
January 21, Thiess has a 22 percent
interest in the company operating in the
Moura coalfields in Queensland, which
contracts for the export of about
million tons of coal per year. The pre-
sent capacity of the open-cut mining
operation and railway to Gladstone is
about million tons of coal per year,
but as from April next year the full
tonnage of 4£ million tons will be
shipped. Last month the first stage in
achieving this higher figure was com-
pleted with the finishing of a second,
and much larger, dragline excavator.
This dragline weighs 6600 tons and
can move itself at the rate of one mile
every five hours. The size of this piece
of equipment, which is the largest of

its type in the world, can be gauged
by its capacity of 200 tons per “bite.”
The final cost of the dragline was $l2
million, its enormous consumption of
electricity (18,000 horsepower) will
limit its operation until the installation
of additional generating capacity.
It is interesting to speculate on the
results that would flow from the receipt
of additional coal contracts for Thiess-
Peabody-Mitsui. When the project is
producing \\ million tons per year,
Thiess will be receiving $780,000 by
way of royalties, as well as dividends
from its 22 percent equity interest. Such
dividends could easily add a further
15-20 cents per ton to Thiess’ earnings
from this source. Although further con-
tracts would require additional invest-
ment in mining equipment, Thiess
would still be receiving its royalty and
Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui Pty. Limited
would benefit in that the capacity of
the railway, to which it contributed
some $l6 million, could be increased at
relatively little cost.
On the basis of the present known
contracts, however, Thiess should in
a few years be earning sl£ million
from this operation almost as much
as last year’s record profit from all its
activities. With prospects of improved
earnings from its engineering division
and its very profitable distributorship
of Toyota commercial vehicles, there is
every reason for the company’s shares
to be popular, i
Commodities
A coming drop for
copper prices
“WHAT PRICE COPPER?” is still
the big question in the metals markets.
Although U.S. and South American
labor disputes and loss of skilled white
employees in the Congo’s mines have
managed to push LME prices up £2O
a ton or so recently, most attention is
on how low prices will be by 1968.
Recent gains have been very small
on the basis of the U.S. strike alone
smelters which supplied 1.8 million
tons of the Western world’s 5.1 million
tons production in 1966 have been
closed. The net surplus of 140,000 tons
predicted for 1967 and stocks of 200,000
to 300,000 tons held by U.S. consumers
are cushioning the blow. Neither side
is anxious to negotiate, but if the dead-
lock lasts more than a few weeks the
U.S. Government may apply compul-
sory measures for a return to work.
Despite the strike, many observers
(including the London “Metal Bulle-
tin”) are predicting prices at or below
£stg.3oo a ton by Christmas.
At present producers and consumers
are busily trying to establish in the
industry’s mind their respective views
on an acceptable long-term price for
the metal. The British Non-Ferrous
Metals Federation (of fabricators) has
stated that recent levels around £350
a ton were too high. The Federation
also says in its annual report that the
1962-63 producer price of £stg.236 a
ton was “historically high.” What price
the consumers would now find accept-
able is not indicated.
The producers, on the other hand,
have been suggesting for some months
that £3OO a ton is the lowest accept-
able price, given present costs. Fabri-
cators put forward the threat of sub-
stitution as one of their main argu-
ments for low prices. But clearly
sheer lack of metal is the most import-
ant factor in substitution an expen-
sive task which upsets the even tenor
of life for the fabricator, and is
therefore not to be lightly undertaken.
And uneconomic price levels will lead,
sooner or later, to under-supply.
GHANA’S DEVALUATION threw
the world cocoa market into a spin,
slicing about £lO a ton off prices in
one day. This underlined the fact that
speculators faint-hearted speculators
have been the dominant factor in
cocoa recently.
After the initial reaction much of
the loss was restored, with values level-
ling out around £205 a ton. This is
about £l5 a ton below the best levels
reached earlier this year, after the
strong lift in the previous 18 months.
Cocoa use appears likely to exceed
production for several years, and pros-
pects of price lifts to reflect this posi-
tion attracted heavy speculative buying
earlier this year. Recent figures for
grinding, for chocolate, and other uses

in the main Western consuming areas
have shown a generally weaker trend.
The market therefore dampened,
even though the fall was not enough
to wipe out the expected deficit, and
despite the arguments of some that
latest figures are distorted by a trend
toward processing in the producing
regions.
Devaluation by the top producer at
first raised visions of production boosts,
but this is not now thought likely, and
is anyhow some way in the future.
Even at present prices, growers should
be well satisfied. If some of the argu-
ments put forward by the more opti-
mistic observers prove correct, further
gains should be scored later this year.
THE CURRENT shortage of nickel,
and a lift in the price of New Caledon-
ian ore, has hastened moves in Japan
toward formation of a nickel-ore
importers’ cartel. If the W.A. nickel
province is as big as some believe, there
will shortly be several actual or
potential Australian suppliers. Remem-
bering the lessons of competing Aus-
tralian iron ore producers negotiating
with united buyers, local industry and
the Government might make plans for
co-operation among nickel suppliers
from the start.
As has been pointed out here, the
present world shortage of nickel is
quite unlikely to last more than 18
months or two years. Although Inter-
national Nickel at present has sufficient
control of world supplies to hold the
present producer price against pressures
either upwards or downwards
this could be changed in coming years,
adding to Australian producers’ prob-
lems.

Industrials broadly have conveyed a rather firmer impression.
They are, of course, still crowned by BHP, which, on extensive
dealings, climbed 40 cents to finish at $10.40. Other leaders, like
CSR and ICI, improved slightly; Henry Jones, however,
managed a 19-cent addition and reached $3.07. Howard Smith
(shining from BHP) put on 15 cents. Australian Guarantee got
near its top for the year on a 19-cent advance to $1.85. Minster
dropped 20 cents to a low $l.BO. Some doubts seized the miners,
yet adequate rises were shown by Western Mining (50 cents),
Hamersley (26 cents), and CRA (12 cents).

C.S.R. Co’s ANNUAL REPORT
POINTS FROM DIRECTORS’ REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
In their annual report to shareholders, reviewing the operations of
the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd., the directors referred to:
• Record total production of the company’s sugar mills in Australia
and Fiji.
• Low world price for raw sugar and hopes for progress towards a
new International Sugar Agreement.
• Improved results from the company’s interests in building materials
and industrial chemicals.
RAW SUGAR MILLING BY C.S.R.
Despite a very severe drought in Fiji,
the group’s mills in Australia and Fiji made
a record of 825,000 tons of raw sugar in
the 1966 season. Prices, however, were
unsatisfactory.
The Company’s Australian Mills
The 521,000 tons of raw sugar made by
the company's Australian mills in the 1966
season was 100,000 tons more than the
previous record of 421,000 tons in 1965.
The four Queensland mills made 386,000
tons (32,000 tons, or 9%, more than the
previous record in 1965) and the New
South Wales mills 135,000 tons (44,000
tons, or 48%, more than the previous
record of 91,000 tons in 1964).
In Queensland, wet weather in the first
three months of harvesting caused loss of
crushing time, but after August record
crashing rates were achieved. Victoria, the
company’s biggest mill, gave a notable
performance by crushing over 50,000 tons
of cane per week for eleven consecutive
weeks. The company’s Queensland mills
should make about 397,000 tons of sugar
in 1967.
New South Wales production in 1967
is expected to be about 123,000 tons.
FIJI
Normal rains since December > have
relieved the exceptionally dry conditions of
the past two seasons. The rains came too
late to benefit the 1966 crop, which yielded
only 304,000 tons of raw sugar to South
Pacific Sugar Mills Ltd.
There are hopes of exceeding 350,000
tons of sugar this season.
The persistently low world prices would
have been economically grave for Fiji had
it not been for the British Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement.
Fiji has recently taken an important
step on the way to self-government with
the election of a Legislative Council com-
prising 36 elected and not more than four
official members. It is worth repeating (in
part) what was said in the 1964 annual
report.
“South Pacific Sugar Mills and C.S.R.
regard themselves as part of the Fiji com-
munity and we hope to continue to play a
constructive role in improving its situation.”
Political development is more practicable
of achievement and more soundly based if
it rests upon good, stable economic
development.
The Fiji sugar industry is advanced and
sophisticated. In its social achievements
and in its system of independent farming,
it is particularly advanced for a develop-
ing country a fact which has drawn
favourable notice from experienced
observers.
GENERAL SUGAR MATTERS
Total Australian Raw Sugar Production
Australian production in 1966 was a
record 2,289,000 tons.
For the 1967 season, the present estimate
of total output from the 34 mills (of
which seven are C.S.R.) is about 2,300,000
tons.
Commonwealth-Queensland Sugar
Agreement
This agreement between the Queensland
and Commonwealth Governments was due
for renewal this year, at the end of its
normal five year period.
The two Governments recently conferred,
extended the agreement for a year and
amended it by increasing the refined sugar
price from 19th June, 1967. The whole-
sale price for 1A grade rose from $180.52
to $206.72 per ton.
The company’s earnings as refiners are
not affected by the higher selling price for
refined sugar. The increased revenue is
passed on in full to the sugar pool and
augments the raw sugar price to the
growers and millers. C.S.R., being a miller,
shares in the benefit of the higher price
for raws.
World Sugar Price and Situation
The so-called “world price” of sugar is
important to Australia and Fiji. For the
1967 season, about 52% of the total sugar
expected to be made in Australia and 44%
of that to be made in Fiji is to be sold
at prices related to this “world price”.
International Sugar Agreement
Dr. R. Prebisch, Secretary-General of
UNCTAD, met representatives of major
sugar importing and exporting countries
in Geneva in March and again in June to
discuss how further progress could be
made towards a new International Sugar
Agreement.
BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN
ECONOMIC COMMUNITY
British Commonwealth Sugar Agreement
The B.S.C.A. does more than anything
else to stabilize and support the sugar
export earnings of Australia and Fiji.
About 40% of Australia’s export income
from sugar, and about 66% of Fiji’s have
lately come from their sales to the United
Kingdom under the B.C.S.A.
The renewed effort by the United King-
dom to seek entry into the European
Economic Community is obviously of the
most fundamental interest to the British
Commonwealth sugar exporters.
The B.C.S.A. protects the economic
well-being of geographically, politically and
socially important areas throughout the
British Commonwealth. This is particularly
so in Fiji. It is sometimes overlooked,
however, because Australia is a large
country, that this is also the case in the
heavily populated north-east coast of Aus-
tralia the only well-developed area of
tropical Australia.
REFINED SUGAR
Australia: The five C.S.R. refineries in
Australia sold 598,000 tons of sugar pro-
ducts for the year ended 31st March 1967,
1.4% more than in the previous year.
New Zealand: New Zealand Sugar Co.
Ltd. Sales for the year ended 31st March
1967 were 134,000 tons, an increase of
2.8% over the year before.
Mr. J. W. Dunlop, Chairman of the Colonial
Sugar Refining Company.
C.S.R. BUILDING MATERIALS
The Building Materials Division continued
to make progress and total sales and
profitability for the year ended March
1967 were again better than for the pre-
vious year.
Hardhoards Australia Limited (50%
C.S.R.): This company began trading on
16th January 1967 and has settled down
satisfactorily.
Gypsum Products Group: The Gyp-
rock factories and plaster mills are all
operating well. A new plaster mill is being
built alongside the Gyprock factory at
Yarraville in Melbourne. It should be
operating early in 1968, and will supply
high quality plaster for the plaster trade
and for our Melbourne Gyprock factory.
C.S.R. Vijiyl Flooring Group: Sales of
floor tiles have continued to increase in
quantity, but price competition is very
severe.
Pyneboard (50% C.S.R.): Sales of Pyne-
board have continued to increase.
Bradford Insulation (85% C.S.R.):
The mineral wool market for home and
industrial insulation continues to grow.
Hardie-8.1. (50% C.S.R.): Sales of
Hardie-8.1. industrial insulation were also
better than for the previous year.
INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
C.S.R. Chemicals Pty. Ltd. (60%
C.S.R.): There was an increase in the value
of sales, and in profits, in the last financial
year. The associate companies, C.S.R.C.-
Dow (50% C.S.R. Chemicals) and B. F.
Goodrich-C.S.R. Chemicals (40% C.S.R.
Chemicals), both increased their output
and sales during the year and continued
high production is forecast for the current
year.
OTHER ACTIVITIES AND
INTERESTS
Distilleries: The demand for distillery
products generally increased although
prices edged down and costs up. For the
current year sales are slightly higher.
Ocean Vessels: Compared with the pre-
vious year, the amount of cargo was much
the same, but it was rather less profitable.
Gove Alumina Project: Nabalco Pty.
Ltd. (27i% C.S.R.): Progress has been
made with the detailed feasibility study for
this project.
The study is proceeding to schedule and
should be completed about the end of this
year.
Mt. Newman Iron Ore Venture: The
financing of Pilbara Iron represents, we
believe, the largest commercial money rais-
ing of equity and debt capital that has been
achieved in Austcalia.
Construction has begun. It is one of the
largest single undertakings by private
industry in Australia. csri97a


THE LAND
A forecast of wool demand?
By the RURAL EDITOR
IN AN UNUSUAL burst of candor,
the chairman of the Wool Board, Sir
William Gunn, has revealed that the
International Wool Secretariat has been
engaged for 18 months in an effort to
forecast demand for types of wool. Sir
William, who is also chairman of the
IWS, said the object of this work was
to give woolgrowers practical guidance
on production trends for the future.
Growers of crossbred wool, in New
Zealand particularly, might wonder
what real work has been going on for
the 18 months mentioned by Sir Wil-
liam.
Critics of the IWS were quick to
point out that this vast organisation
was unable to give any warning what-
soever of the New Zealand debacle.
Sir William’s latest revelation only
compounds the inadequacy of the IWS
service to the growers, who, with tax-
payers, provide it most liberally with
funds.
There is just a subtle hint in Sir
William Gunn’s statement that industry
leaders, who meet usually in very
comfortable surroundings (i.e., Wool
House), are anxious to see some action.
He said: “After a year of negotiations
with the International Wool Textile
Organisation, the first meeting of a
working group drawn from seven major
consuming countries took place in
January this year with the IWS, which
later issued detailed questionnaires to
the participating countries. When
IWTO met in Brussels last month, four
of the seven countries had progressed
to the point of producing basic fore-
casts. The remaining three undertook to
complete their section of the work by
the end of the year.”
Sir William said it was hoped that
the first “consolidated” report would be
produced in time for consideration at
Black-end rot in bananas (left); after thiabendazole dips (right)
the January, 1968, meeting of the
IWTO. The work was being done by
economists of the IWS and the IWTO.
The IWS, he said, had decided almost
two years ago to ask IWTO for its
co-operation, in the mutual interests of
growers and processors, in seeking to
produce forecasts, five years ahead, of
likely shifts in demand for broad types
of wool.
If, and this is quite possible, grow-
ers and processors do not have a
mutual interest, then the IWS really
has been wasting its time in expecting
co-operation from the IWTO. The
IWTO represents the trade in about
the same way that the IWS repre-
sents growers. It gets, from the trade,
the same kind of criticism that the
IWS and the Wool Board get from
growers. It was described, recently, by
one of these trade critics as “a bunch
of barnacles trying to function as pro-
pellers.”
The opinion seems to be hardening
amongst Australian growers that the
IWS can perform a useful function, but
that it should do those things it can do
and forget about those things which it
could spend 25 years, or for ever, trying
to do. Mutual interest is what is sup-
posed to make international commodity
agreements, wheat agreements, and so
on work. Yet somehow different people
have different ideas of what constitutes
mutual interest.
Gunn has said he will retire in 1969.
He has said this kind of thing before
and usually it is his way of throwing
down the gauntlet to troublemakers
he will retire if they can produce some-
one who can do a better job and
usually they produce no one. It would
probably be correct to say he is thinking
about retiring.
All the grower organisations are tip-
ping their favorite sons for the job.
In Western Australia they want R. V.
Sewell; in N.S.W., the United Farmers
and Woolgrowers’ Association is mount-
ing a campaign on behalf of its new
president, Claude Renshaw. In Vic-
toria, there are at least three names
being bandied around. But the most
intriguing one of all, coming from
Queensland, is that of W. J. Vines,
present managing director of the IWS.
The question is pretty open at this
stage and will remain so, for the reason
that what Sir William says about
retiring and what he does about it are
not necessarily the same thing. He may
not be as anxious to retire as some
of his associates seem to think. The
plum job, in any case, seems unlikely
to be quite the same under any new
chairman as it has been under Gunn.
Agrisearch
Cheaper usage of thiabendazole
SCIENTISTS AT THE renowned
Agricultural Research Station at Rua-
kura, N.Z., are now telling local farmers
that pasture spraying with thiabenda-
zole is an efficient and economic way
of preventing facial eczema in sheep.
When we last mentioned this matter
(Bulletin, June 24), the method
appeared promising as a direct and
simple tactic for overcoming an intrac-
table disease, but the cost was pro-
hibitive. An amount of $4O an acre
was estimated for the treatment.
Results from the latest trials indicate
that this figure has been cut five-fold.
Further reductions seem likely. The
scientists exploring this novel aspect
of thiabendazole, Mr. D. P. Sinclair and
Dr. J. N. Parle, suspect that the key
to economy is timing. Only quite small
quantities of the chemical may be re-
quired if it is sprayed on the pasture
just before the facial eczema fungus,
Pithomyces chartarum, begins its rapid
build up to poisonous levels.
Laboratory tests show that thiabenda-
zole is a fungicide of unprecedented
power. Solutions as weak as one part
in ten million are utterly fatal to the
fungus and suppression is still consider-
able even at the extremely low dilution

of one in 20 million. Put simply, the
practical problem now facing the N.Z.
Department of Agriculture is to trans-
late this enormous killing capacity to
the field without undue loss of effi-
ciency. Apart from timing, the solution
to this problem could lie partly in
finding the ideal spray nozzle and in
making a finer grade of thiabendazole
powder. In its present form the chemi-
cal is intended for veterinary use and
is somewhat coarse for use as a fungi-
cide.
Last season at Ruakura was not a bad
one for facial eczema. Even so, 60 per-
cent of the sheep in the area suffered
some degree of liver damage, which
would curtail their productivity and
lower life expectancy. Sheep on the
thiabendazole-sprayed pastures were
completely unharmed. Spray rates as
low as Jib. thiabendazole per acre
checked the fungus for at least a month.
According to Mr. Sinclair, fat-lamb
raisers would find this a paying proposi-
tion. Next year he intends to undertake
a more elaborate set of trials. Using
different spray equipment, and perhaps
a finer grade of the powder, he hopes
to get control over the fungus with as
little as 2oz. of thiabendazole per acre.
A fascinating speculation is that,
while controlling the facial eczema
fungus, the thiabendazole pasture spray
might also have a worthwhile inhibitory
effect on the internal parasites of sheep.
The amount of the drug ingested with
the pasture would surely be too small
to purge any of these worms from the
stomach and bowel, but there may be
enough on the pasture to destroy the
larvae during this free-living stage of
the parasites’ life cycle.
Another, more substantial, possibility
is that this drug can penetrate the
leaves of plants and work systematically,
circulating from shoots to roots. Over-
seas reports, still somewhat vague, claim
that this is indeed so, in the case of
some plants at least. Since thiabenda-
zole is of undoubted effectiveness against
worm parasites in animals it might well
prove to be equally efficient against eel-
worm and other plant nematodes.
Actually, the N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture and CSIRO have com-
pleted a series of trials which confirm
the recent intimation by the Queens-
land Department that thiabendazole
dips stop black-end rot of bananas.
Very weak solutions are all that are
needed to give excellent control for the
period between harvesting and ripeness
for eating. It would seem that one of
the more serious troubles besetting our
banana industry has been overcome.
Just one thing: the Department of
Health has not yet approved of the
treatment. It can hardly object, how-
ever. Thiabendazole, in small and large
doses, has been given to millions of
domesticated animals, zoo animals,
laboratory animals, whales even, and
men themselves to rid them of their
worms. None has come to any harm.


War had become a laboratory for World
War 11. In China, Japan’s Imperial
Armies had ravaged Tientsin and Nan-
king, seized Shanghai and Peking. In
America, the effects of the Great De-
pression still oppressed U.S. life.
Sometimes Weinbaum’s friends gath-
ered at 'his Pasadena home, sometimes
at the homes of other members. Dr.
Tsien was a regular, savoring the high-
level, if gloomy, conversation and the
musical sessions that topped off such
evenings. Tsien was a dilettante
musician who played the block flute.
Weinbaum liked to accompany him on
the piano.
Some who attended the sessions had
little notion of the politics behind Unit
122. To them, these were harmless
living-room chats over coffee, and the
payment of ten cents per session was
only a contribution for refreshments. To
others, the money meant dues to the
Communist Party.
To some, subscriptions to “The
Daily Worker” and “Daily People’s
World” were to support the cause.
Others never noticed the hammer-and-
sickle mastheads. Some felt it their
duty to carry Party cards and use fic-
titious names. Others could not, later,
recall ever signing anything or recog-
nise false names listed on documents
alongside their own.
Dr. Weinbaum often supplied “study
material” excerpts from Karl Marx,
scraps of searing biographies of Wil-
liam Randolph Hearst, readings from
Leftist thinkers. The group discussed
Communism, too, but as Dr. Tsien
would say later, only “as a force in
the political scene of the world.” It
was mostly debate, he recalled. Every-
body argued.
Each autumn the Communist Party
staged a recruiting drive in Los
Angeles County, and sympathisers were
encouraged to fill out applications.
Party members often took it upon
themselves to fill out the forms for
desirable prospects, and it was not
necessary for the prospect even to
know about it. The Pasadena branch
used a registration card in lieu of appli-
cation form, each card carrying a tell-
tale “bug” that identified Party docu-
ments. The card’s ultimate destination
was the office of the district member-
ship director in San Francisco, who
issued a membership book in the re-
cruit’s real or fictitious “Party name.”
As a Party courier, William Ward
Kimple had access to the cards. He
and Clara would meet secretly with
Red Hynes, and the three would trans-
cribe copies of Party forms to mimeo-
graphed sheets. Kimple then sped the
originals back to Party headquarters.
To this day, Kimple avows, he remem-
bers clearly when the name H. S.
Tsien popped up, linked with the Party
name “John M. Decker.”
“Captain Hynes was making copies,”
Kimple says, recalling the incident.
“He came to this particular one and
wanted to know who this Chinese was.
I told him I didn’t know. He said, ‘I
wonder why he took the name Decker
Chairman Mao applauds the feat
for a Party name. I wonder if he knows
Comrade Decker.”
There was a female comrade at the
time whose real name was Decker.
Possibly, Hynes speculated, this
Chinese knew her and took the name
for that reason. It would not occur to
Hynes to question whether the form
itself was genuine. His mission was to
find Reds. He didn’t know Tsien from
Confucius.
Ignorant of the damning nugget that
Hynes tucked away in his files to
gather dust for another dozen years,
Tsien went about his business of prob-
ing the potential of rocketry.
Pasadena echoed to explosion after
explosion. Many a citizen was certain
that madmen were at work, who,
inevitably, would blow themselves to
bits. The experimenters had scarred
their own backyards with rocket tests
gone awry. For a while, the tiny band
had permission to use Caltech’s Aero-
nautics Laboratory after school hours.
But one experiment with a propellant
misfired, and the entire lab was en-
gulfed in acrid fumes. The hardy crew
moved to a concrete platform outside
the laboratory. New explosions smashed
down another wall.
That did it. Caltech banished the
group. Derisive students labelled them
the “Suicide Club.”
Dr. Tsien and a few other daring
associates ignored the chorus of ridi-
cule. Exiled to rocky ravines shadowed
by the Sierra Madre, they developed
techniques that one day would propel
the United States and eventually
Red China into outer space. By the
time Hitler ignited the fuse of World
War 11, the Suicide Club had wrestled
with the problem of JATO jet-
assisted take-off. A dare-devil pilot
flew a light plane to which Suicide
Club members had strapped a rack
of rockets. The experiment sprayed
the airstrip with fireworks. The plane
never got off the ground. But Frank
Malina’s devoted band persisted and
achieved a rocket-assisted take-off.
Most daring of all, the group stripped
away the plane’s propeller, towed the
aircraft down a runway by truck to
gain speed, and switched to rockets.
The plane shot up ten feet in a cloud
of smoke, then glided back to earth.
Suicide Clubbers had achieved
America’s first manned flight by rocket
power alone.
Malina dreamed of motors to power
a rocket 1000 miles from earth and
send it hurtling through space at 11,000
miles an hour. The space age was within
his grasp. The world hardly noticed.
After America’s entry into World
War 11, Tsien was cleared for top-
secret assignments. He became director
of the rocket section of the U.S.
National Defence Scientific Advisory
Board under General Henry H. (Hap)
Arnold. Arnold awarded him a War
Department commendation “for his
excellent and complete survey of ram-
jet and rocket propulsion in this coun-
try and in Europe, and his valuable
original theoretical work on the theory
of ramjet and rocket performance.”
Tsien was cited also for his study on
the possibilties of applying nuclear
energy to propulsion. James B. Conant
and Vannevar Bush honored him, as
well, for research “contributing to the
successful prosecution of World War
II.” When the thunder of the guns
had died away, Tsien was given the
rank of colonel and flown with a
secret mission to Germany’s Black
Forest to probe the rocket secrets of
Hitler’s scientists. Back in America,
Tsien joined a team of experts to
examine, under Air Force auspices, how
a future war might be fought in the
skies. Tsien made important contribu-
tions to the final report: chapters on
the possible use of atomic fuel for
aerial propulsion and use of solid fuels
in rockets. Such ideas were the basis
for U.S. postwar military development.
Tsien’s Hsue Shen’s colleague, Dr.
Chao Chung Yao, equally trusted by
the American military, mingled almost
unnoticed at Bikini with a hundred
other official observers, their eyes shiel-
ded by goggles so dark that no natural
light could seep through. Dr. Chao
heard the electrifying; words from the
B-29 Superfortress: “Bomb away! Bomb
ajvay and falling!” After a tense 40
seconds, an enormous fiery ball scorched
the sky, hovering briefly over the lan-
guid, blue Pacific. From the cloud rose
the telltale nuclear mushroom. Chao
already had gained a solid reputation
on Caltech’s campus, particularly for
his work on scattering gamma rays by
atomic nuclei. A brilliant scholar, he


had come to Caltech in 1926, and in
four years had earned a Ph.D., magna
cum laude. He was at Bikini for “Oper-
ation Crossroads” on a July day in 1946
as an official observer for Chiang Kai
Shek’s Republic of China, even then
engaged in a life-and-death struggle
with Mao Tse Tung’s Communists.
A few months after Chao studied
that explosion at Bikini, Tsien Hsue
Shen learned that his mother had died
in Shanghai. He sailed home during the
summer of 1947 to console his father,
then in his late sixties. In Shanghai,
Tsien met Yin Tsiang, beautiful and
cultivated daughter of one of Chiang
Kai Shek’s generals. She had studied
singing in Europe and played the piano
with skill and feeling. They married,
and Tsien briefly contemplated remaim
ing in China for good. He was offered
the presidency of his alma mater, Chiao-
tung University. But Chiang’s Education
Minister judged Tsien too young, at 37,
for so exalted a post and rejected the
appointment. Tsien was depressed by
what he saw in Nationalist China. He
wrote friends in America, describing
the misery and poverty he encountered.
After three months, he returned to the
United States.
At Honolulu, Tsien scrawled “no” on
an immigration questionnaire that
asked if he ever had been a member of
an organisation advocating overthrow of
the U.S. Government by force. That
“no” would haunt him. Yellowing in
Capt. Bill Hynes’ files in the Los
Angeles Police Departmpent was a nine-
year-old scrap of paper that would per-
suade U.S. authorities Tsien was a liar.
Tsien had seen enough of China to
be convinced Mao’s Communists would
take it over. His future, he decided, was
in America. He filed a Declaration of
Intention to become a U.S. citizen.
At 39, in 1949, Tsien was at the pin-
nacle of his fame. He had accepted an
aerodynamics professorship at MIT, but
three institutions vied for his services
as head of rocket- and jet-propulsion
study. He chose Caltech, where he had
spent so much of his life.
That December, Tsien stood at a ros-
trum in New York’s Staffer Hotel and
eight years before the dawn of an
age of earth satellites startled the
American Rocket Society with his vision
of space travel. He pictured a trans-
continental rocket liner shaped like a
fat, sharpened pencil with a ramjet
engine and rocket motor. It would
vanish from sight seconds after takeoff
and not be seen again until just before
landing, thousands of miles away.
This was Tsien’s hour of triumph. It
came two months after the Communist
Chinese had routed Chiang Kai Shek
and seized Tsien’s native land.
Tsien enjoyed his last blaze of glory
in the Uinted States, the country he
intended to adopt as his foster-father-
land. A few months later, the FBl’s
knock on his door brought whatever
dreams he nourished to an abrupt end.
Stunned, Tsien quickly reported to his
superiors what the FBI had told him:
he was suspected of being a Communist;
his security clearance for sensitive work
would be revoked.
Dr. E. C. Watson, then Dean of the
Faculty at Caltech, remembers well how
Tsien strode into his office with the
news. “I’m returning home,” Tsien an-
nounced, his full underlip set in a hard
line. Dr. Watson was shaken.
“For heaven’s sake, why? You’re
happy here.”
“I was brought up to believe that
when you are a guest, you do nothing
to offend your host,” Tsien replied. “I
am a guest in your country. I am now
an unwelcome guest. I am going home.”
There was no way of arguing him out
of it. He was being hounded by the
FBI, which claimed he was a member
of Unit 122, Communist Party, and had
perjured himself with that “no” to
Immigration’s question in Honolulu.
Few who knew him at Caltech
believed Tsien was a Communist Party
member. His associates sensed he had
been deeply hurt after having given so
much of his life to America. This was
at the height of an era of suspicion,
when Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his
Communist-hunters were in full cry.
Caltech was not immune from the hunt,
and neither was any highly placed
Chinese in the United States. The
Korean War had broken out, and
America seemed seized by a passion for
total security.
Tsien booked passage on the Presi-
dent Wilson, a luxury liner bound
for Hong Kong. He called a moving
company to crate his belongings the
same company that his colleague, Chao
Chung Yao, had called. Physicist Chao
also had come to the conclusion that
America at that moment was no place
for a Chinese scientist. He, too, booked
passage on the President Wilson.
A letter from China that said his
father was ill and in need of an opera-
tion strengthened Tsien’s decision. The
letter may have been a fraud. Commun-
ist China had been sending out many
letters attempting to lure key Chinese
to the homeland.
Tsien’s plans to sail ran into snags,
so he bought tickets to leave late in
August on Canadian Pacific Airlines.
Meanwhile, Caltech urged him to appeal
against the order lifting his security
clearance. He did so, but with reluc-
tance. He flew to Washington late in
August to see Dan A. Kimball, then
Under-Secretary of the Navy. Kimball
was on leave from his position as vice-
president of Aerojet, a brainchild of
the original Suicide Club members.
Tsien had known Kimball fairly well.
He had maintained links with Aerojet,
which was to blossom into a sprawling
corporation with a role in virtually
every U.S. rocket program, from satel-
lites to Atlas and Polaris missiles. Tsien
served the company as a consultant.
Kimball was waiting when Tsien
reached the Navy Department.
“They claim I’m a Communist,”
Tsien said.
“Hell,” snorted Kimball, “I don’t
think you’re a Communist.”
Tsien said he intended to go back to
China. “I’m Chinese,” he told Kimball.
“I don’t want to build weapons to kill
my countrymen. It’s that simple.”
“I won’t let you out of the country,”
Kimball told his friend.
The salty Navy Under-Secretary said
to others later, “I’d rather shoot him
than let him leave the country; he
knows too much that’s valuable to us;
he’s worth five divisions anywheie.”
Kimball extracted from Tsien a
promise to stay, pending an appeal to
regain his security clearance. When the
scientist had left to catch a plane back
to Los Angeles, Kimball called the State
Department. Under no circumstances,
he warned, should Tsien be permitted
to leave the United States.
Tsien’s plane taxied to a halt at Los
Angeles International Airport. Tsien
bade his seat companion, by chance
another scientist, good night, and rose
from his seat. He came face to face with
a tall man, who quietly handed him a
paper. Agent Allan G. Juhl, general
investigator of the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalisation Service, waited while
Tsien read the paper: an order not to
leave the United States.
Next morning he cancelled his reser-
vation. He and his wife withdrew S2OO
from her bank account, and also took
out her jewels and the family’s war
bonds. Tsien felt Yin and the children
should proceed to China while he
remained behind. A few days later he
changed his mind. The family would
stay together. Tsien did have one ship-
ment of his belongings crated. He had
the moving company pack books and
documents, some still bearing “confi-
dential” and “secret” stamps. The eight
cases, weighing 1800 pounds, were
marked for shipment to Shanghai.
Judge Ben Harris ordered the
crates seized. Men from a dozen Federal
agencies swarmed to the harbor ware-
house and pored over the documents.
The Government contended its inspec-
tors found, among other things, photo-
graphs, sketches, negatives, blueprints,
and code and signal books. (It turned
out later that one “code book” was a
logarithm table.)
Tsien admitted some documents bore
security stamps, but insisted all were
outdated, none classified. He claimed
he had locked the current classified
documents he possessed in a cabinet
and handed the key to Dr. Clark Milli-
kan of Caltech. The material he wanted
to ship consisted of his own research,


much of it notes from his lectures. But
not for another year did Tsien recover
most of his material. None of this
material was found to be top secret.
Agent Juhl served, he said later, as
“agent of the State Department,” an
indication that the Department had
acted quickly on Kimball’s advice.
Immigration had no authority to keep
Tsien from leaving, but the State De-
partment could put a hold on him under
passport regulations. And Customs had
put out an urgent call for all informa-
tion on the Chinese scientist.
“This piece of paper blew the lid,”
Juhl told the authors, holding up a copy
of Exhibit 6, the key bit of evidence
in the U.S. case against Tsien. It was
the same fateful paper that Red Squad
Chief Bill Hynes had copied from a
Communist Party registration form in
1938. It bore the name “H. S. Tsien”
and the party name “John M. Decker.”
For two old friends who had shared
the musical evenings under Unit 122’s
dubious auspices a dozen years before,
September 7, 1950, was a time of dis-
aster. On that day physicist Sidney
Weinbaum’s career came to an end in
a hushed courtroom of the greystone
U.S. Federal Courthouse in Los Angeles.
Despite an unwavering stand of in-
nocence, Weinbaum was convicted of
perjury for denying before an Army
review board that he ever had been a
Communist, used an alias, or advocated
a Communist form of government. He
had so testified in appealing his security
discharge from a project in the ultra-
secret Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Judge
Ben Harrison the same judge who
had ordered Tsien’s documents seized
sentenced Weinbaum to four years’
imprisonment.
Only the evening before, the long and
agonised suspense had ended for Dr.
Tsien. The shy, scholarly loner had
been aware since the FBI knock on his
door in June that he was under in-
tensive surveillance. As the summer
waned, Tsien often stood at the front
window of his Altadena home, waiting
for the inevitable. He would stare across
the spacious lawn to a point beyond
the rail fence where a black sedan was
parked, partly hidden by limp eucalyp-
tus trees lining Buena Loma Court. One
day, Tsien was sure, someone would
come up the walk and take him away
from his bride of three years and his
two children.
On September 6, a new sedan pulled
up, and two figures emerged. Tsien
quickly rcognised one of them, the man
who now rapped sharply on the door.
Tsien’s wife, her delicate, round face
taut, black eyes wide with apprehension,
went to the door carrying six-month-old
daughter Jung Jen (the Tsiens called
her Mamie) in her arms. Her son, two-
year-old Yucon like Mamie, a native-
born citizen of the United States
was cowering in a corner as if he had
sensed a crisis.
Allan G. Juhl, of the Immigration
and Naturalisation Service, politely
introduced himself and his companion,
Bill Kaiser. Mrs. Tsien stepped aside
to admit them, noting that Juhl wore
handcuffs dangling from his belt. A
bulge under his suit jacket betrayed the
presence of a snub-nosed revolver.
Slowly and deliberately, Agent Juhl
read the arrest warrant. The Justice
Department judged Tsien an alien who
was “a member of an organisation . . .
that advises, advocates, or teaches the
overthrow by force of the Government
of the United States.”
Tsien listened. He slipped from the
room and reappeared moments later
with a shaving kit, three books, and a
portfolio of papers. He kissed his wife
and children and stepped out into the
sunlight, his five - foot - seven figure
dwarfed between the two tall agents.
“There was no emotion,” Juhl remem-
bered later. “It was almost as if he
were saying to himself, ‘Well, it’s finally
over.’ ”
Compassionately, Juhl waited until
they reached the car to search Tsien,
to avoid embarrassing his wife. Satisfied
the scientist was unarmed, they put him
in the back seat for the long drive to
San Pedro, his destination a cell in the
Detention Centre.
For two weeks Tsien lived in virtual
isolation. He scarcely touched the meals
from the Detention Centre mess. He
preferred to go hungry, waiting for the
days his wife could bring Chinese deli-
cacies prepared at home. Most of the
time he lay on his bunk thinking, pay-
ing little attention to his prison mates,
many of them “wetbacks” chattering in
unintelligible Mexican Spanish.
He brooded about old colleagues:
Frank Oppenheimer, pursued by the
Red-hunters, retired from science in
favor of a nonsensitive ranch in Colo-
rado; Frank Malina, who had done so
much to prepare America for the assault
on outer space, now an expatriate work-
ing with UNESCO in Paris.
Tsien emerged from behind bars
under $15,000 bail. He returned home
to ponder the paradox: the United
States had declared him exportable, but
wouldn’t let him go.
William Zisch, now vice-chairman of
Aerojet-General, had a personal affec-
The Army... cheers for their new
weapon
tion for Tsien, regarding ldm as “by
far the most effective and valuable con-
sultant in the whole stable of consult-
ants” at the company. Hearing Tsien
had been released, Zisch drove to Alta-
dena, intending to stay ten minutes at
Tsien’s home to iron out details of his
position.
It was twilight when Zisch arrived
at 360 Buena Loma Court. In the living-
room, the rugs were rolled back, lamps
pushed to one side, as if the occupants
were ready to move out any day. Zisch
was struck by the change in Tsien.
The Chinese, normally uncommuni-
cative, poured out his innermost
thoughts. So absorbed did the two men
become in conversation that they for-
got to turn on the lights. They just
talked on and on in the dark until
Zisch finally thought to snap the switch.
The sudden glare underscored the
pathetic drama of the topsy-turvy room.
Tsien said he had not really wanted
to go to Red China at all, certainly
not to stay. “He gave me the impres-
sion,” Zisch said later, “he was going
to cause his father to join him in Hong
Kong and spend his father’s remaining
years there. He told me about the FBI
and how they were so sure he was a
Communist because they had seen a
scrap of paper.” It wasn’t true, Tsien
insisted over and over. And there was
no way Zisch could persuade Tsien
that fair play could win out in the end.
A few weeks later, the power and
majesty of the United States confronted
Dr. Tsien in a grubby little 10ft. x 20ft.
room, its windows sealed against the
clamor of downtown Los Angeles traffic.
Tsien, in a well-cut dark suit, smiled
enigmatically as Albert Del Guercio,
the examining officer, bore down on
him. Del Guercio had long practice in
anti-subversive investigation for the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalisation
Service.
The Government had no intention
then of expelling Tsien, but it went
through days of long, torturous hear-
ings to prove him deportable.
From the outset Tsien denied ever
joining the Party. Did he, Del Guercio
demanded, ever attend Party meetings?
“I did not attend meetings of the
Communist Party to my knowledge,”
Tsien insisted. He would concede only
that, “Looking back, I see ... it is pos-
sible that these gatherings I attended
could be meetings of the Communist
Party . . . but I myself had no know-
ledge that these were Communist Party
meetings when I went.”
Vainly Tsien’s counsel, Grant B.
Cooper, insisted that the whole case
rested on hearsay and testimony of
professed ex-Communists. Doggedly
protesting, Cooper entered 202 objec-
tions to the Government’s questions.
Almost invariably he was overruled by
hearing officer Roy Waddell.
At one point Del Guercio referred
to the respondent as “this comrade
Tsien.” Cooper leaped to his feet,
objecting angrily.
“Overruled,” snapped hearing officer
Waddell.


“Can’t we even strike out the ‘com-
rade’?” asked Cooper wearily.
The lawyer’s plea went unanswered.
Tsien, sometimes struggling with the
language, seemed mystified by the
assault tactics of an American prose-
cutor. Del Guercio was relentless.
“Do you owe your allegiance to
Communist China?”
“I do not,” Tsien replied.
“To whom do you owe allegiance?”
“I owe allegiance to the people of
China.”
Del Guercio sparred with Tsien for
a moment and then demanded: “In the
event of a conflict between this coun-
try and Red China, would you fight
against Red China for the United
States?”
Tsien parried. The situation had not
presented itself. There was no such
war. Again Tsien’s lawyer protested.
His client would need time to think
about such a question.
“We will wait here six months,” Del
Guercio snapped.
But Tsien volunteered that it would
take only moments. The room fell
silent.
Five minutes ticked by. Finally
Tsien said, “I can’t answer the ques-
tion now.”
“You can’t or won’t answer the
question now?”
“I can —c-a-n —answer the question
now,” replied Tsien, stung, “and the
answer is as follows: I have already
said that my essential allegiance is to the
people of China, and if the war between
the United States and Communist China
is for the good of the people of China,
which I think is very likely to be, so
then I will fight on the side of the
United States. No question about that.”
“But you will make the decision first?
You will determine whether it is for
the good of the Chinese people?” Del
Guercio asked.
“That decision, yes, I would make.”
“You will not permit the Government
of the United States to make that de-
cision for you?”
“No, certainly not.”
That apparently was the Govern-
ment’s case.
The hearings dragged into the spring
of 1951, and on April 26 the hearing
officer declared his decision: Tsien was
an alien, a native and citizen of China,
who was “subject to deportation on the
grounds that he has been found to
have been, prior to entry ... an alien
who was a member of the Communist
Party of the United States.”
Tsien could not leave Los Angeles
County without permission. He was
declared subject to expulsion, but far
too valuable to expel.
Chao Chung Yao, the man who one
day would blend his atom-bomb skills
with Tsien’s missile expertise, had an
easier time of it. He had laid his de-
parture plans well.
Agent Juhl, the man who had arrested
Tsien, tried to stop Chao from leaving.
Juhl had been told to give the case
highest priority. But there was no scrap
of -paper, no “Exhibit 6” extant against
Peking University Physics School . . .
a new generation of physicists
Chao. The Service could put a stop
order on some of Chao’s luggage in-
cluding scientfic equipment he had
bought while at MIT in Boston
but there was nothing to warrant hold-
ing Chao’s body.
In Yokohama, the U.S. Army was
waiting for Chao. Military police
marched aboard the liner, arrested Chao
and two Chinese students, and took
them ashore. The students were accused
of “complicity” with Tsien and of pos-
sessing restricted documents missing
from Caltech. Radio Peking made loud
noises, proposing Leftist demonstrations
to condemn the arrests. But evidently
the Army had not enough on Chao to
keep him. He and the two students
both physicists sailed the next morn-
ing for Hong Kong, from where they
entered Red China.
Only weeks after he arrived in China,
according to Intelligence reports, Chao
established an atomic-research institute
in Peking. There, a visiting Australian
scientist met Chao in the autumn of
1964 and chatted, over cups of fragrant
green tea, about the forthcoming China
bomb.
Later, on the eve of China’s debut
in the Nuclear Club, the visitor
inquired for Chao. But Chao, said his
fellow scientists, was “out west”
out west in the Takla Makan Desert.
Men who knew Tsien well say he
would have stayed had his security
clearance not been upset by the FBI.
After all, he had filed his first citizen-
ship papers. But his friends knew how
deeply hurt he had been.
Remarkably, although virtually a
prisoner, Tsien snapped out of his mood
of depression and plunged into new
work during his final years in the
United States. He found the stamina
to turn out a technical paper every
month for four months in a row, as if
this outpouring of labor were the only
way he could suppress his resentment.
He taught mathematics. He wrote a
book on engineering and cybernetics.
Despite the brand the United States
had placed on him, he still was widely
quoted in scientific journals up to, and
even after, the time he left the country.
Finally, after five years, Tsien was
able to close his Californian home, free
to leave the country. The Justice
Department evidently had decided that
five years had been enough to decon-
taminate him and nullify his menace.
If the one-time Navy Under-Secre-
tary Dan Kimball had had his way,
Tsien never would have left. But Kim-
ball was by then out of Government
The new Republican administration
was responsible. And, in Kimball’s
opinion, it bungled.
Late in 1955, Tsien and his family
booked passage on President Cleveland,
sailing for Hong Kong. Tsien never
bothered to call his attorney, Grant
Cooper. And the Government did not
bother to alert Cooper, either. Cooper
protested angrily. He had intended to
challenge the deportation order in the
courts when Tsien’s restraint was lifted,
but the Government did not give him
the chance. In any event, Tsien wanted
no more of legal proceedings and writs
of habeas corpus. For him, it was good-
bye to America ... for good.
“Swop for U.S. Airmen Rumored as
Scientist Gets Ready to Sail,” cried a
headline in the Los Angeles “Times.”
Many newspapers speculated on reports
that Tsien had been traded for 11 U.S.
airmen held captive by Red China
since the Korean War and released
about that time.
The State Department said piously:
“It would be totally contrary to our
principles,” and insisted, “The United
States has not and is not now engaged
in swopping human beings.”
If Tsien was exchanged, some emi-
nent Americans said, it was a poor
trade. The United States gave China
one of America’s and the world’s
most extraordinary rocket experts.
When, years ahead of expert fore-
casts, a Chinese missile with a nuclear
warhead landed on target in the desert
wastes of Sinkiang, Americans could
look back to the McCarthy days and
wonder: What was the security per-
centage in driving into enemy arms a
man who could fashion such instru-
ments of destruction? Few friends in
America ever heard from Tsien after
he reached China. But Dean Watson,
at Caltech, did receive one Christmas
card, postmarked Peking. It bore a
drawing of a typical Chinese spray of
flowers. In his precise hand, Tsien had
written: “This is a flower that blooms
in adversity.”

BOOKS
Woodrow Wilson’s struggle
with his father —and Europe
By TALIS POLIS
Thomas Woodrow Wilson, Twenty-
eighth President of the United States.
A Psychological Study. Sigmund
Freud and William C. Bullitt.
Weidenfeld and Nicolson. $5.45.
A STRAY OBSERVATION in Scott
Fitzgerald’s notebooks proved curiously
evocative of the subject: “France was a
land, England was a people, but
America, having about it still that
quality of the idea, was harder to utter
it was the graves at Shiloh and the
tired, drawn, nervous faces of its great
men, and the country boys dying in
the Argonne for a phrase that was
empty before their bodies withered. It
was a willingness of the heart.” Ameri-
can lives and wealth were spent in
Europe in the name of God, Christ, a
just and ultimate peace, the brother-
hood of man, the salvation of humanity,
a world to be made safe for democracy
and spent in vain. Freud and Bullitt
attribute no small portion of all this
to a little boy’s complex and crippling
psychological involvement with his “in-
comparable” father, the Reverend
Joseph Ruggles Wilson, Presbyterian
Minister and Professor Extraordinary of
Rhetoric.
If this book were not remarkable
enough for other reasons, the combina-
tion of subject and authors would suf-
fice. The life of a perhaps unusually
neurotic great man whose time of power
coincided with a momentous upheaval
in the world has been put to the joint
scrutiny of one author who created
psychoanalysis and shifted a frontier of
Western thought, and of another who
“happened to know personally” Clemen-
ceau, Orlando, Lloyd George, Lenin,
and Wilson, and, who, aged twenty-
eight, resigned from the American peace
delegation in Paris to denounce his
President for a betrayal of faith.
Bullitt and Freud decided to col-
laborate on this volume in Berlin in
1930. The manuscript seems to have
been finished by 1933, but “disagree-
ments” arose and it was not till 1938
shortly before Freud’s death in
London that some unspecified
changes were made and both men
signed it. It was first published two
months ago. Some questions remain.
What were the disagreements? Did
Freud object to analytic over-
simplifications on Bullitt’s part or
(much more likely) did Bullitt want
to shield the dead statesman from
Freud’s bitter contempt? How special-
ised were their contributions on
psychology and diplomatic history?
Since there is evidence that Freud
thought the book would be published
in the early ’thirties, who prevailed
against this? In which language did they
write? Perhaps another vault under
U.S. Marine guard holds the answers.
There is a rough consensus that
among the valid applications of psy-
chology to politics is the stsudy of key
Freud, 82, is met by Bullitt (right) and Princess Marie Bonaparte in Paris on
his way to London in 1938, after the Nazis expelled him from Vienna
Woodrow Wilson ... crippling
psychological involvement
actors in crucial situations; President
Wilson is almost a paradigm case. On
Freud and Bullitt’s showing the future
of European civilisation and the vagaries
of Wilson’s personal character formed
on several occasions a tragically direct
nexus. Mr. Bullitt outlines the evidence
on which this study rests: all available
biographical materials plus “scores of
volumes” on Wilson’s career plus fif-
teen hundred pages of data culled pri-
vately from intimates. Despite the mas-
siveness of this information the authors
acknowledge that theirs is not a direct
analysis of Wilson; the subject was
dead.
They did succeed in unravelling some
strands of the personality which re-
mained essentially unchanged from
childhood to death. Woodrow Wilson
orated, organised debating forums,
“loved” ultimately “treacherous”
younger males, and confounded his
father, his God, and himself in recur-
ring cycles for sixty years. However,
there are some grotesque over-
interpretations which will make the
task of denigrators easier. For instance,
as Wilson, late in 1919, leaves on his
near-psychotic and near-fatal tour to
canvass support for the sullied peace
treaty we are proferred the interpreta-
tion “one may be sure that in his
unconscious when he boarded the
train he was mounting an ass to
ride to Jerusalem.” Since Wilson was
never on the couch, this (even if meant
figuratively) is precisely the sort of
thing of which neither we nor they
can be sure.
This is the last document with
Freud’s signature we shall see, and its
style deserves comment. Clinical


detachment has shrunk noticeably.
After Versailles, Freud is reported to
have deeply resented Wilson’s piously
ignorant intrusion into European affairs,
and in the introduction of this volume
he admits bias. At first the bias adds fire
to the prose: “He was rapidly nearing
that psychic land from which few
travellers return, the land in which
facts are the products of wishes, in
which friends betray, and in which an
asylum chair may be the throne of
God.” But one senses also a chasm
between the values of the preacher-
politician subordinating facts to faith
and phrases, and the analyst to whom
insight, consciousness, and reason are
elusive and secondary human traits,
yet who values them above others.
A decade of Wilson’s young man-
hood is dismissed with: “He remained
a virgin full of dyspepsia, nervousness,
headaches, and ideals.” The ideals may
as well be tapeworms. There are other
changes of style; concepts such as uni-
versal bisexuality, which, in 1900,
would be introduced with tender per-
suasion and hard evidence, are here
merely assumed beyond the ken of the
ill-educated. The metaphors in “Wil-
son” are almost wholly electrical:
libido charges accumulators and finds
outlets along conduits. And the brusque-
ness is not entirely due to contempt
for Wilson.
In his last decade, Freud was scarcely
a mellow old man. A single instance
will have to do, but it assumes poig-
nancy in the present context. To
Arnold Zweig, Freud wrote, in 1936:
“Whoever undertakes to write a bio-
graphy binds himself to lying, to
concealment, to hypocrisy, to flummery,
and even to hiding his own lack of
understanding, since biographical
material is not to be had, and if it
were it could not be used. Truth is not
accessible; mankind does not deserve it,
and wasn’t Prince Hamlet right when
he asked who would escape a whipping
if he had his desserts?”
Cupboard books
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
Private Case Public Scandal. Peter
Fryer. Seeker & Warburg. $3.25.
Six years ago, Peter Fryer, who first
claimed attention in 1956 when he left
the Communist Party and wrote the
book “Hungarian Tragedy,” had occa-
sion to visit the British Museum to
consult a couple of volumes, as he puts
it, “on sexual questions: a work by
William Acton called ‘The Functions
and Disorders of the Reproductive
Organs’ and Irwin Bloch’s ‘Sexual Life
in England Past and Present.’ ”
His chief purpose in consulting Acton
Peter Fryer ... sexual questions
was to find the context in which he
had called it a “vile aspersion” on
women to suggest that they experienced
sexual pleasure.
Eiryer found a note scribbled across
the returned application slip for Bloch’s
book: “Please see the superintendent.”
The latter, when seen, explained that
he had to satisfy himself that Fryer’s
purpose in applying for Bloch was
serious, and that he was unlikely to
steal, mark, or mutilate it.
“I wondered what he would have
said if I had told him I wanted to
read the book for pleasure, or from idle
curiosity, or to enrich my fantasies.”
In due course Fryer was directed to
the north library, a reading-room for
those who wish to consult rare and
valuable books, and, as he found, certain
other works which are known in the
museum as “cupboard books.” These
are guarded books of one genus but
two species: sexological works and
works of sexual “art.”
Cupboard books, are, however, listed
in the general catalogue. Fryer’s re-
searches led him to another kind which
was not on the public shelves, nor listed
in the general catalogue, in the subject
indexes, or referred to in the 72-page
booklet which claims to be a compre-
hensive guide to the museum and its
services.
The museum, he found, has a species
of non-book which is referred to
when that painful task is necessary
as being in the “private case.” And, on
further inquiry, this was revealed in
all its guilty secrecy as the most com-
prehensive collection of erotica in the
world.
In the first half of his book Fryer
unburdens himself of the course of his
discoveries and what he has been able
to plot of the history of the “private
case.” That duty performed, he relaxes
into a romp through its wares.
For six months “Private Case —Public
Scandal” was prohibited by the Aus-
tralian Customs Department. It was
only recently released. The reason, no
doubt, was that it includes a number
of samples of the kind of activities
described in the books on the shelves of
the “private case.”

Impressions of Africa. Raymond Rous-
sel. Calder & Boyars. $5.90.
ROUSSEL’S AFRICA has nothing to
do with geography. It is a cold, dark
continent of the mind, full of childishly
manufactured monkey-puzzles and card-
board figures which the author manipu-
lates with a joyless, despotic power.
This novel is unmistakably the “Impres-
sions” of an imaginary traveller.
Born in 1877, Roussel first published
this book at his own expense in Paris
in 1910 fortunately for him he could
afford it, just as he could afford other
fetishes and eccentricities. Much of
“Impressions” reads like the blueprint
of the thoughts of a very split person-
ality who has only just succeeded in
sublimating his fantasy-world by getting
it down on paper.
This ought to be fascinating, but isn’t.
It is, for instance, a country quite dif-
ferent from Genet’s dreamlands, which
are lush, erotic, and, above all, genuine
literature. Roussel’s Never-Never is flat
and dead. It may be “surrealist” but it
still isn’t art.
Roussel had remained obscure until
his recent rediscovery and election to
cult-hero by some contemporary French
authors. Alain Robbe-Grillet (“Last
Year in Marienbad”) claims to have
learnt much from the study of his
automatic, mathematic, meaningless
word-games of patience, which is prob-
ably why his own later novels are such
a confounded bore. Now Rayner Hep-
penstall is translating Roussel for Eng-
lish readers and is soon to issue a
guide.
“Impressions” has, as basis, a typical
schoolboy plot: the adventures of a
crowd of shipwrecked passengers who
are seized by a mythical Negro emperor
and held for ransom. A glance at the

Life or illusion?
By LEONIE KRAMER
Jerusalem the Golden. Margaret
Drabble. Weidenfeld and Nicolson.
$2.65.
THIS IS Margaret Drabble’s fourth
novel, and to have written so many
within her 28 years is perhaps evidence
of what struck me immediately—that
for her writing is not an effort but
a natural pleasure. “Jerusalem the
Golden” is, in fact, an old-fashioned
novel. For one thing, it is cheerful.
It is about a young woman’s success-
ful fight to escape from her back-
ground and to find a fuller, more
satisfying life in London, the Jerusalem
of her visions.
She sees herself clearly, and is neither
blind to nor complacent about her
deficiencies. She believes in action,
and takes it where others would hesi-
tate. She is greedy for experience, and
swallows it prickles and all. One
might suspect her motives, deplore her
ambitions, or shudder at her ideals
but still want her to succeed.
Clara’s character is created by the
accumulation of detail about her past
and present. Her reactions to the ex-
perience of life in her hometown in
the north of England and in London
are meticulously and humorously
recorded. The three main centres of
her existence the North, London,
and Paris—are seen as she sees them,
their features formed according to her
view of what life should be. To have
conveyed so strongly to the reader the
impression of seeing three very dif-
ferent kinds of worlds with the eyes
of the one character is a considerable
achievement.
With the people through whom Clara
finds her way to emancipation, Miss


THE SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE AEFAIR •
THE SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE has already caused one
of the most heated controversies in that city's history.
Is Utzon's design the most "marvellous of this cen-
tury" or "an architectural caprice"? Which is the most
important design or function? Who can be blamed
for spiralling costs the architect, the engineering, the
Labor Government who inaugurated the affair, or the
Liberal-Country Party Coalition who took it over?
Should an architect pioneer technological innovations
which cost time and money to his client? And, more
recently, was Utzon deliberately forced to resign? What
were the roles of the Government, the Royal Australian
Institute of Architects, Arup and Utzon himself in this
drama? How far have the architectural panel who suc-
ceeded Utzon altered his plans? A concert hall or an
opera house?
The author examines all these and other questions and
attempts to present an unbiased picture of this “battle
of the giants". Beginning where the four assessors
chose Utzon's competition design from 223 entries, he
traces the progress of the building and the rising ten-
sion among the protagonists through to Utzon's
resignation in chapters entitled:
THE FRAMEWORK OF DISASTER UTZON AND
HIS PLAN FALLING OUT WITH ARUP UTZON
AND THE BUREAUCRATS UTZON AND THE
AMATEURS THE RESIGNATION DRAMA.
The new design architect, Peter Hall, provides an
Epilogue. The author's argument is supported through-
out by quotations from contemporary documents
letters, minutes of meetings, office memoranda, parlia-
mentary speeches, public statements, and diaries;
some relevant documents are printed in full in the
Appendices. This is the first time some of this evidence
has been published.
This is a book about what has been called The Eighth
Wonder of the World, and the Biggest White Elephant
of all Time. The author has tried to find out Why.

Drabble seems to me less successful.
The mother is something of a cari-
cature, and there is no evidence that
there is more to her than Clara sees.
The London family which represents
to her the image of her own aspirations
is believable enough. They are an
entertaining collection of characters;
that they hold glamor and excitement
for Clara needs no argument. Yet, like
her mother, they are stagy, belong to
that happy breed, the amiable English
eccentrics.
It is not at all easy to decide to
what extent, if at all, Clara should
attract our criticism. The change in
her way of life and in her attitudes
and prejudices is real enough, but her
view of her own progress might well
be an illusion.
Books in brief
Sex in the frigid zone
Monday at McMurdo. David Burke.
Reed. $2.85.
ONCE DAVID BURKE had solved
the problem of getting sex into the
Antarctic, he had wonderful back-
ground material, gathered during three
trips to the area while working for
Australian newspapers, for his thriller.
There is a fascination for even the
most unscientific or unadventurous in
how to survive in an area where most
instinctive behaviour is not only use-
less but disastrous. With all that ice
and snow, “Monday at McMurdo” is
Jack Londonish rather than James
Bondish, but highly competent and
enjoyable.
jßritain’s Uncle Toms
The Working Class Tories. E. A. Nord-
linger. McGibbon & Kee. $7.70.
ABOUT HALF the British Conserva-
tive Party’s electoral strength comes
from the support of manual workers,
the manual workers concerned making
up about a third of the total working
class. With financial assistance from
Princeton University, Mr. Nordlinger
has run a sample of them through a
survey on everything from whether
they think a peer’s son makes the best
kind of political leader, to whether
they feel free to complain about what
happens to them at work.
He sees parallels between British
working-class attitudes to Government
and the attitudes of Colonial peoples to
their masters. There are the rebels who
see everything wrong, and the “Uncle
Toms,” who seem to be pleased when
their own interests are hurt. Then
there are the indifferent and the
“deferentials.” His particular interest
is in the “deferentials” those who,
although undoubtedly working-class,
aspire toward Conservative norms,
wanting Eton old boys as Prime
Ministers, and despising working-class
solidarity. He finds “deferentials”
among the supporters of both parties
but, although there are fewer of them
among the younger Labor Party sup-
porters, they still remain strong among
the young working-class Tories.
Strange starting point
The Novel Now. Anthony Burgess.
Faber. $4.25.
THE INDEFATIGABLE Anthony
Burgess took time off from writing a
novel to thump out this lively guide
to modern fiction for students. In the
main he deals with work written after
World War 11. He covers a great deal
of ground, taking in, he explains,
American as well as British fiction, and
looking at what novelists in Europe,
Asia, and Africa are doing.
Burgess mentions only Patrick White
among Australians, which is fair
enough. But he puts forward this
strange view: “The few days that Law-
rence spent in Australia were sufficient
to inspire a novel that native-born
Australians (often with generations of
Australian experience behind them)
regard as their literary starting-point.”

LETTERS
"Their Shining Eldorado"
Having enjoyed two of Elspeth Hux-
ley’s books on Africa, it seems sad that
she found Australia so glum and drab,
because it is not the Australia I know.
I recognise some of our landmarks,
of course, such as our destruction of
flora and fauna (although I could rather
impolitely suggest to Mrs. Huxley to
take another look at her beloved
Africa), our Australian Ugliness, the
difficulties of Australian women in the
outback. But that' the total scene is
one of “Anglo-Saxon Drabness,” of a
uniformity of dress, of the Un-Sex Life,
and of a total unimaginativeness (if
one can believe Mr; Dutton’s review,
8., July 5) makes me wonder where
I have lived the 41 years of my life.
Australia is like a growing child
full of vulgarities and uncertainties, yes
but lusty, imaginative, and as full
of as much fun and liveliness as one
can find in any other country. Its cities
have certain physical features which
make them unlike a big city like
London, Paris, New York, or Tokyo.
It is rather silly to look for those
activities that can only go with a big
city life in a country such as this. And
it is a mistake to think that because
more emphasis is put on family life in
this country than in London that there
is not as much imaginativeness here as
there.
The fact that Mr. Dutton agrees with
her dislike of Australia makes me
wonder how we both manage to be
South Australians of about the same
generation.

Fighting Vets.
The Minister for the Army suggests
(8., July 15) that an entirely accurate
view of negotiations with the Australian
Veterinary Association was not given in
“Fighting Vets.” (8., July 1).
It is true that discussions are current
on the gainful employment of graduate
National Service Trainees (after their
basic training requirements) in a civil
aid unit proposed for Vietnam, but the
“Fighting Vets.” article dealt mainly
with the re-establishment of an army
veterinary service.
In April, 1966, Mr. Fraser decided
that there was no case for this on the
grounds that the needed skills and
service are already provided by army
medical officers. The AVA does not
agree with this decision.
Medical officers would diagnose
disease in humans transmitted from or
by animals, but their basic training does
not provide for recognising diseased
animals. Such recognition by a
veterinary officer, with subsequent
advice to the Medical Services, could
well be of paramount importance in
maintaining a healthy army.
As to the danger of returning troops
bringing new diseases into Australia, the
knowledge and recognition of animal
diseases in the country in which our
army is employed are of the utmost
importance. The commendable animal
quarantine service of the Health Depart-
ment would be strengthened by infor-
mation of any sudden change “over
there” imposing increased threats to
our animal disease control measures in
Australia. In guarding our country
against exotic disease, information from
trained veterinarians would be of
greater benefit than instructions promul-
gated by the Military Board.
The American Army, recognising the
skills provided by basic academic train-
ing, employs a large Veterinary Corps
as well as a Medical Corps.

Facts of the dairy industry
“Must we butter up the dairy farm-
ers?” (8., July 22) again raises the
question of the dairy industry so
dramatically highlighted during the
recent droughts in N.S.W. The general
reference for most is the Common-
wealth Year Book. The compilers of
this are often tempted to wishful com-
position rather than cold fact.
Although the production of whole-
milk has risen 33 percent throughout
Australia from 1939 to the present
time, production in Queensland was
down by 17 percent, and in N.S.W.
by 9 percent. After a spectacular rise
in 1959, production in Tasmania
returned closer to the 1939 figure.
Small increases appear in S.A., W.A.,
and a larger one in the exotica, A.C.T.
Victoria had an overall increase of
almost 85 percent.
Perhaps the most potent index of
the situation is the actual farm income.
The average farm income for all farm-
ing types in Australia is approximately
the current basic wage. The farm in-
come for dairying in N.S.W. averages
only 34 percent of the basic wage. In
Queensland the figure is 50 percent. In
order to set such a condition in order,
one of two actions seems appropriate:
convert the farms to a more economic
use or raise the subsidy. In spite of
the present generous subsidy, 14 per-
cent of all dairy farms in Australia
return no net profit. In particular, 31
percent of the farms in northern
N.S.W., 16 percent in Queensland, and
13 percent in W.A. return no net
profit.
In butter production we see another
index. For Australia production rose
by 6 percent between 1961 and 1965.
A degree of stability was established
in Tasmania, W.A., and S.A. in that
order. In Victoria production was up
by about 16 percent; in N.S.W. and
Queensland, down by 23 percent and
about 8 percent. Not only does the
detrimental climate influence this dis-
mal trend. To a certain extent
mechanisation and centralisation of
large independent as distinct from co-
operative factories have contributed
also.
In N.S.W. and Queensland produc-
tion of milk per cow has shown a
very slight general increase from 1939
to date as against an increase of 40
percent in Victoria. The same familiar
tendency is shown in the number of
milking appliances in each State. Diver-
sity in the industry is less indicative,
but still significant. In Victoria there
are 120 different milk-derived pro-
ducts; in N.S.W., 70; in Queensland,
69; S.A., 43; in Tasmania, 24; and 18
in W.A.
One wonders how to face these hard
facts. So many committees have sought
to do something about it, but they have
either simply sat down to exchange
mutual ignorances or constituted them-
selves as a group who individually can
do nothing about the matter and col-
lectively decide that this is the best
course of action. Having in mind the
effects of the Royal Commission on
the wheat industry, it seems that we
are now urgently in need of a Royal
Commission on the dairy industry.

Whipping horses
As a non-starter in the rat-race and
one who also believes that every crea-
ture on this earth has a right to live
decently and to be treated decently,
I was really pleased to read your article
(8., June 17) on Wally Hoysted and
his “Stop the Flogging” campaign. It
is good to know that in our time, and
in our community, there are people like
Mr. Hoysted who not only hold this
belief but who are ready to do some-
thing for it, to make sacrifices for a
conviction which, as I hope, the
majority of Australians share (however,
sometimes rather subconsciously).
Even in the racing world, the voices
supporting Mr. Hoysted’s views are not
so timid any more. A young jockey
by the name of L. Hope, e.g., has won
over 12 races in the past few weeks,
riding all his mounts hands and heels
only. And there are others, of course.
But after the gruelling experience of
this year’s GN Steeplechase it must
be said that things are still far from
good. If hitting a horse over 40 times
at the end of a three-mile race is not
cruelty, one wonders where cruelty be-
gins. Yet it seems to me that owners
and jockeys are not the ones who are
most to blame. As long as the VRC
do not bring in a clear, distinct rule,
and enforce it accordingly, there will
be confusion among the jockeys, and
among the public as well.
