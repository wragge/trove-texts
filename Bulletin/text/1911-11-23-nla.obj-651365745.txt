Hewlett at Home Again
“Once upon a time—in those dim days
when Maximilian 111. reigned over Jadis, and
Sir Prosper le Gai adventured id Morgraunt,
as has been related elsewhere —Gernulf de
Salas was Lord of Speir and of the whole
Valley of Stones.”
So, having slain the intolerably philoso-
phising Senhouse, Maurice Hewlett returns,
in The Song of Penny (Macmillan, per Dym-
ock’s Library), to his own again. Returns
with pomp and high spirits and the bright
eyes of youth. Once more we are
back in the time when Prosper le Gai
rode questing in The Forest Lovers. Here
we have the medieval setting that only Hew-
lett, of all living authors, can so brilli-
antly, so sumptuously, paint; here we have
the gorgeous tapestry of romance hung in a
medieval castle of Hewlett’s own rich imag-
ining, fit background for Iris queenly hero-
ines, the cousins Sabine and Mabilla. First
for Sabine: —
“By this time, she was, to all seeming,
the most sumptuous maid the broad world
could hold. Voluptuously formed, deep-col-
ored, glossed like a peach, her eyes the hot
blue of Venetian water, her velvet lips so
perfect one would fear to kiss lest one might
break their frail wonder, her hair at once
long and abundant, fine and strong—she was
the rich-blooded Renny type carried up to a
point, a grave, flawless, fierce-burning image
of her cousin Mabilla.”
And now for the cousin:—
“In face and form at once sumptuous and
fine, at once delicate and hardy, showing at
once the tender oval and frail lips of the
Madonna, the dauntless eyes and thrust
bosom of the Nike of the Greeks.. . .such was
the young lady Mabilla. .. .She had dark-blue
eyes (which changed with her moods), black
lashes to them; a neck like a shaft, a shape
audacious in so young a girl; an upper lip
too short for kindness, and a chin too full
for humility.... In matters of love she was
believed impregnable. She was accounted a
barbed virgin, a girl of whips and steel.”
Upon Hewlett’s crowded canvas stalk the
giants of those days, red, hairy lords of
rapine, prince-bishops more prince than
bishop, troubadours in love with love and
singing bravely of it, weak women and fond
adventurers, all busied at statecraft and
wit-combats, tourneys and love-making, in-
trigue and slaughter. And the scene is a
country of peaks and wind, dominated by
great walled castles, mapped out and named
with loving care by Hewlett, in a time when
kisses were easy, but the payment for them
ruthless, and maidens were proud, yet
luscious. Here, for instance, is a specimen of
love-making in the feudal fief of Hewlett in
the time of Maximilian the third :
“When at last she looked up into his face
it was with the wondering eyes, the moving
lips, the mute apoeal of a child. He stooped
his head to takO his wages. For one breath-
less moment the lips of Lanceilhot Paulet
touched upon the lips, frail as a petal, soft
and pasture-breathed, of Mabilla de Renny;
and then they rested for another moment,
handlocked and liplocked, while the soul of
each from its inner hold cried to the other,
Dear heart, take heart from me.”
And yet, brilliantly done as is The Song
of Renny, alive as are his rascals and his
queens, the concessions Hewlett demands
from his reader are too great —not for the
joy of the story, but for the belief in it. You
cannot quite help objecting' that medieval-
ism was not like this. It is too splendid, too
large, too —again in Hewlett’s pet phrase—
too sumptuous. The country, despite Hew-
lett’s detailed description of it, is too small
for these large armies and larger amours.
The fault lies, of course, in medievalism. If
it wasn’t like this, it ought to have been.
We must thank Hewlett for so brilliantly re-
building the dream castles of long ago; and,
thanks to Hewlett, they are almost there. A
book to be enjoyed, and a book that stands
on the high level of The Forest Lovers.
Tho Turkish Woman
According to Hester D. Jenkins, the Amer-
ican author of Behind Turkish Lattices
(Chatto and Windus, per Lockley Library),
Pierre Loti, in his novel, Disenchanted, has
exaggerated both the number of edu-
cated Turkish women and their standard of
learning. The upper class of Turkish
women, it appears to one who has been on
terms of intimacy with Turkish society, do
not read Hegel and play Bach, nor have
they trained philosophic minds. But the dis-
content of which Pierre Loti writes is com-
mon enough behind Turkish lattices, owing
to the influence of the poorer class of senti-
mental French fiction. But even the women
who read French novels form a very small
minority in Turkey. The average Turkish
lady is as simple and uncontrolled as a child;
her conversation is largely made up of ex-
clamations, such as “Allah!” and she is in-
tellectually vacant.
She has but two duties to her husband:
she must be attractive and bear him chil-
dren. The middle-class Turkish woman does
no work. She has practically no amuse-
ments. She is prevented from being athletic
by her costume. She could not play tennis
in a veil, nor “bike” in a charshaf. She does
not play dominoes nor bridge. And when she
really feels the need of relaxation, she sits
down.
“All Oriental women occupy an enormous
proportion of their time in sitting. And
when they sit, it is not in the restless way
that we have, but with the hands idly folded
in the lap, in the perfect repose ot a sleep-
ing cat, often for hours without even conver-
sation.”
The Turkish marriage has, at least, the
charm of excitement. A friend ot the
author’s was given two portraits to make
her choice from, but, of course, she never
saw her husband until he lifted the wedding
veil from her face. This experience is still
very common in Turkey, but in more. ad-
vanced families the parties are sometimes
permitted to make each other’s acquaint-
ance after their betrothal. Of course, all
Turkish marriages are arranged by the
parents, the author having heard of only one
love match. “The chances of happiness,
however, in marriages thus arranged, seem
almost as great as they are in countries
where the young people choose for them-
selves.” '
Which suggests some reflections on the
subject.
You see, you choose an Australian girl-
well, for a dozen good reasons. The first is
because you want her. The other 11 reasons
don’t matter. And she accepts you because
(1) you asked her first, (2) she likes the
way you waltz, or the shape of your chin,
or the hue of your eyes,/or the feel of your
moustache, (3) she wants a house of her
own to boss, (4)' she wants a husband of her
own to boss, (5) she imagines that after
marriage you will continue to be bossed. In
short, she accepts the importunate lover at
her feet, and marries the stranger who is her
husband. And, at one memorable breakfast
you discover, clear-eyed, that she is none of
of the things you thought her, but merely a
woman. No matter how careful be your
choice, you never marry the woman/~you
choose. You marry the sex. And you would
be horribly disappointed if you found her
after marriage the divine being you honestly
thought her when you proposed. And she
too, is not unhappy in finding out that she
did not marry a hero, but a husband —“with
socks to darn and a preference for under-
done steak. The Turkish husband runs
none of these risks. All he knows is that
he is going to marry a woman. lie gets her,
and promptly shuts her up and never men-
tions her to another v man. And as she never
speaks to another man, and is probably
shared by her husband with a couple of
other‘Wives, she is perfectly contented with
her one-third husband. Her only excitement
is the discussion of him with the other tw;o-
thirds of his wives. An Australian girl
would be unhappv in a Turkish harem; a
Turkish girl married to an Australian would
miss the companionship of his offier. wives
and the rapturous coinparison of their and
her babies. Happiness is a mere matter of
custom and latitude.
There are, however, certain restrictions
on the Turkish husband’s choice. He may
not marry a mermaid or a djinn, nor a
pagan. And his wife should be inferior to
him in age, fortune and dignity, but superior
to him in manners, politeness, modesty and
beauty. How-ever, he may marry her by
force or by joke, only a verbal consent being
necessary. And he is not now 7 allowed to
brand his wife, or otherwise label her with
hot iron.
He can have four wives if he likes —‘that
is, if he can afford the luxury. For he must
treat each alike. If he gives one wife a dia-
mond tiara, he must order three other iden-
tical diamond tiaras for the other wives.
And if one wife pleads for a pianola, he usu-
ally declines. He could not stand four
pianolas. Among the lower classes, how-
ever, there is a preference for three or four
wives—they do the work and allow the hus-
band plenty of time to play dominoes. But
there are not enough wives in Turkey for
this luxury to be general, even with the im-
portation of slaves.
The author of this readable book gives an
interesting account of the sale of Circassian
girls from the Caucasus mountains for the
modern Turkish slave-market. Every Cir-
cassian peasant regards a pretty daughter
as an asset as valuable as an early-rising girl
is to a dairying cocky. Armenian merchants
regularly visit the villages, select the
girls, dress them up and sell them at the
market in Constantinople. They are. bought
by women whose business it is to train them
for the harem. Often a girl becomes not an
odalisque, but the wife of a rich pasha.
An Englishwoman on Australia
An answer to Foster Fraser—if answer
were needed —comes from an unexpected
quarter. In On the Wallaby through Vic-
toria (Heinemann), E. M. Clowes, an Eng-
lishwoman who has lived in Victoria for eight
years, gives an interesting survey of her
corner of the world from the point of view
of an alien who has become acclimatised.
E. M. Clowes sets the critic wondering what
brilliant woman writer has lain so long in
Melbourne undiscovered. But all the evi-
dences point to E. M. Clowes being “Elenor
Mordaunt,” the author of The Ship of
Solace and of a number of brilliant Lone
Hand stories.
She admits cheerfully that her first im-
pressions were all wrong. Unlike that cock-
sure journalist, she stayed on to revise her
prejudices. She is loud in her praise of the
Australian workman, but could not at first
explain his (to her) astounding cleanliness,
until she discovered how much better paid
and better fed he was than his English
mate.
“I have worked shoulder to shoulder with
them for eight years, and I never wish to
work with better people. Their absolute
indifference, except when they really like
or respect a person, their crudity, their com-
mon-sense, their shrewdness, are like a
tonic. And thus, in spite of Mr. Foster
Fraser’s assertion that the Australians can
only exist by the constant effusion of fresh
and virile blood from the Old Country, I
must still believe that, for any elaborate
ideals and ethics of over-civilisation which
we take with us to this new country, we re-
ceive in return very much more, certainly
individually, than we have ever given; while
in respect to the question of virility, Mr.
Fraser must, I feel, have very largely
judged Australians from the towns, and the
undergrown shop-boys and factory girls that
he has seen there.”
She is impressed with the fact that Aus-
tralia is a separate nation, welded by the
spirit of Australia from the diversity of
separate nationalities into one consistent
whole in an extraordinarily short space of
time; and her book is interesting to us
especially for the number of phrases and
words which she quotes as peculiar to this
continent. She even comes along with her
little definition of “Wowser”: “an advocate
Of everything dry, of temperance and all the
virtues, who expresses his opinions in such
a manner that the good he advocates ap-
pears as offensive as he is himself.”
Melbourne impressed her, “with photo-
graphic clearness, as an individual without
eyelashes, staring unblinkingly, showing a
face with no half-tints, no delicacy; and,
though possessing a sort of humanity, as all
big towns do, yet quite without a soul.”
Altogether, E. M. Clowes is a fair critic
of what she considers a country dominated
by the ideal of fairness. She quotes The
Bulletin frequently and with delight. Her
chapter upon Australian art and literature
is, however, peppered with mis-spellings and
mistakes. Carelessly written as it is, the
book has its flashes of deep insight and its
passages of brilliant writing. It tells us
many things that we know, but England
doesn’t. Its main merit is that it is’ a sym-
pathetic presentation of the underside of
Australian life by one who has lived among
the workers.

For those for whom the historical novel
still preserves its charm, The Werewolf
(Stanley Paul, London), by W. B. Beattie,
of Sydney, can be recommended. It is a
picture, conscientiously painted, of the days
of the grand seigneur in France, when
Louis the Fourteenth was a boy, and Car-
dinal Mazarin the ruler of a distracted realm.
Below the talk of the great salons one hears
the fierce mutterihgs of the cowed peasants.
The first book ends with the attempt of the
grand seigneur, nicknamed “The Werewolf,”
to use his feudal right with a peasant girl on
her wedding night; and with the escape of
the girl to Paris the plot hangs on her
efforts at revenge. The revolt of Paris,
headed by her champion, De Ritz, affords
W- B. Beattie a chance of much picturesque
writing. There is a certain looseness in the
characterisation that usually marks a first
novel, and the threads of the plot are some-
times tangled; but it is a most promising,
and. at times, a brilliant, essay, and Aus-
tralian readers would welcome the tale. Un-
fortunately, the publishers do not seem to
have sent an edition to Australia.
The Poet’s Dream, or The Angel’s Procla-
mation to the British Empire, by Alfred
Watts, begins with an “Ode to Sam Hor-
dern’s Death,” and contains much auto-
biographical matter, as thus : —*
My poor father lost his foothold
Upon the mountain side,
And fell five hundred feet below,
When he was sixty-five.
I was about ten years of age
When my poor father fell;
My mother saw him miss his hold—
Oh, Gilles! she did yell.
“The Angel’s Proclamation to the British
Empire” begins with a directness that we
have not hitherto noticed in any angel we
have spoken to.
We ought to fix the interest
For all invested stock,
And cut down all State systems
That are breeding drones to mock
Our honor, toil and wisdom,
etc.
Captain Cook also has a “Warning to
Australia,” beginning breezily thus.; —
I am the ancient Captain Cook,
Now in the Austral clime,
Taking notes of what’s been done
In a century of time.
Good-morning, Mr. Deakin,
I have come to you at last, _
I heard you were Prime Minister,
I see that time has passed.
However, the author states that much of
his poetry has been composed in a trance.

A publishing press should be part of the
necessary equipment of every great modern
university. One of the finest in the world
is the Cambridge University Press. It
printed the authorised version of the Bible
in 1625, and anybody nowadays that wants
a Bible or a Book of Common Prayer must
get it from the presses of the Oxford or
the Cambridge University or the King’s
Printers. Among recent noteworthy pub-
lications from the Cambridge University
Press a?e the Cambridge Modern History,
the Cambridge History of English Litera-
ture and the new (11th) edition of the En-
cyclopedia Bntannica, the. copyright of
which is invested in the University.
“S.T.S.”: The guile of the publisher.
Elinor Glynn’s pornographic “Three Weeks”
was severely handled by (among others, in
the U.S.A.), The Western Christian Advo-
cate, which admitted sadly that “the power
and beauty of its descriptions, and the
pathos of its scenes, are undeniable,” and
then proceeded to consign it to Hades. The
Macaulay Co., of New York, in publishing a
sequel, quotes the above sentence, and omits
all the rest! So the Christian Advocate
goes down on the record as one of “Three
Weeks’ ” little bunch of devoted admirers.
The demand for A Bush Calendar, by Amy
E. Mack (Angus and Robertson, Sydney),
has necessitated a second and revised edition.
The little book is just the thing for a charac-
teristic Christmas present. Bush Days, by
the same author, is another of this typically
Australian series, fitly illustrated by artistic
photographs.
There is a stimulating odor of rum about
the early history of Sydney Hospital; and
in his admirably written History of Sydney
Hospital from 1811 to 1911, (Angus and
Robertson), Dr. J. Frederick Watson furn-
ishes some piquant alcoholic details. The
contractors for the first general hospital in
Macquarie-street, for instance, were paid
by the grant of a gigantic monopoly of the
importation and sale of rum, which mono-
poly Macquarie himself spoiled by paying
the wages of many of the workmen on his
public buildings, in the same liquid. One of
the cheering duties of the medical staff a
century ago was to preside at the frequent
floggings of convicts. These lasted from 30
minutes to two hours. As sentences ranged
up to 500 lashes, and the first three or four
lashes brought blood, the audience of con-
victs could not complain that they were not
provided with entertainment. It must have
been more interesting than the Stadium.
And life in the hospital could hardly be
called dull. “The patients were mustered
every evening by the overseer, who locked
them in their wards in the hospital at sun-
down. There they remained until the fol-
lowing morning at 6 a.m., and so were shut
in without overseer, nurses or attendants
throughout the night, and the abuses that
grew under such conditions may be readily
conjectured when we remember the de-
praved class from which the patients were
drawn. ... No lavatories had been pro-
vided in the hospital itself. . . • Dressings
were thrown under the bed, and lay there.. .
No 'attempt was at first made at the segre-
gation of the sexes.”
Herself, by Dr. E. B. Lowry (Forbes,
Chicago), is a modestly written account ot
physical and psychological truths about
themselves that every woman should know,
put forth in language that will not offend.
“A.S.Q.A.”: The globe-trotter’s references
to the “weird melancholy,” “songless birds,
and “scentless flowers” of Australia is usually
attributed to the reading of Gordon’s poems,
or of Marcus Clarke’s preface to same. But
how many arq aware that these statements
were circulated in England and elsewhere
before Lindsay Gordon was six years old,
and before Marcus Clarke was born? 1
have a book entitled Reconnoitring Voyages
and Travels, with Adventures, in _ the
New Colonies of South Australia : (sic)...
during the Years 1836, 1837 and 1838. The
author is “W. H. Leigh, Esq., M.D., late sur-
geon on board the South Australia Company s
ship South Australian.” It was published
in 1839 by Smith, Elder and Co., London,
at 12s. On pages 103-4 the author observes:
“Among the kings of the air was our
old friend the ‘carrion crow.’ As Captain
Basil Hall says, ‘he is everywhere.’ Here,
then, was ‘Jim Crow’ strutting about
and gorging like an alderman; his per-
sonal appearance not different, but his
sweet voice, if possible, is more musical
than in England. He sings the ‘quaw,
quaw’ as in Britain, but the last quaw is
lengthened into a horrible scream, and
seems to end in a pitiful groan. _ It adds
additional melancholy to Australia’s truly
melancholy wilds. (Kangaroo Island,
South Australia.)
And again, on page 203: —
“No bird of song pipes here, but a few
squalling, beautiful lowries and parro-
quets hopped about the road, and ex-
hibited their plumage to the traveller.
(New South Wales.)”
Opposite page 86 of Dr. Leigh’s work is a
plate showing an (alleged) Australian abor-
iginal carrying an (alleged) old-man kanga-
roo. This picture would delight the heart of
any “Abo.” naturalist.
Rata and Mistletoe, by Dora Wilcox (G.
Allen, London), is one of those little books
of verse that demand notice here mainly
because the author is Australasian. It is
above the average in quality; it voices no
new thought; it is neither foolish nor fine.
The author, now apparently exiled in Lon-
don, remembers her native Maoriland in
pleasant verse; and of the other verses
“The Long Ride” has some of the qualities
of good poetry. Perhaps this Nocturne re-
presents the level of her attainments: —
O when the night is coming down
On. these long miles of London Town —
When one by one the lights appear
Blurred through the city atmosphere,
When lean cats slink like shadows by,
When underneath a lurid sky
My world seems daubed in monotone —
O then I like to walk alone,
To walk alone.
And sometimes strolling round the square,
I watch the lovers loitering there;
Though they are poor, unconth, unwise,
I look at them with envious eyes,
For clumsy form and common face
Are touched by Love’s enobling grace,
And I, who call so much my own,
Still lack so much —and walk alone,
And walk alone.
And often in the dusk I see
The outcasts of humanity;' ,
One has a sleeping baby pressed
So tightly to her ragged breast;
She may be vile, she may be good,
I know not: crowned with motherhood
She is. and all my heart makes moan—
Mother of God! I walk alone,
I walk alone.

An Adelaide Resident of the
“ City of Churches ” writes of
CLEMENTS
TONIC—
Speaks of the Broken Hill mines,
and how he lost his health
through lead and gas poisoning.
Clements Tonic, Ltd., has published -strik-
ing letters in testimony of the great powers
of Clements Tonic in restoring health when
recovery is despaired of. These letters are
striking examples of the value of good health
in contrast to ill-health. This is mentioned
to draw the attention of those who may read
the following letter, or any published in
future. Miners and painters especially should
read this letter, written from Scott and Clyde
Streets, Kensington, South Australia, Sep-
tember 1, 1911.
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD. . 7 „ 7 TT . 7I .
“Of all the mines in Australia I think the Broken Hill mines are
the most injurious for the health of a miner, and it was whilst working
there, and suffering from an attack of lead and gas poisoning, that I first
discovered the merits of your splendid Tonic. IT ACTED LINE
MAGIC IN MY CASE. When I was convalescent I used to feel too
weary and languid for anything; everything seemed a trouble to me, but
after taking a couple of bottles of your famous medicine I felt like a new
man lam well known in Broken Hill, having worked on the Central.
Zincs for 10 years. GRATITUDE AND TILE WELFARE OF MY
FELLOW-WORKMEN prompt me to pen this note, and you are at
liberty to make what use you like of it,, I ™c°mmmA yo_gr Tonic every-
where. (Signed)' EDWARD ELLIS.”
The most effective safeguard one has in these perilous times of contagious
diseases is to have pure blood. In health it-possesses numberless red cor-
puscles or “Policemen” of the blood, whose duty it is to keep out corrupting germ-
causes. To keep the blood healthy use Clements Tome. It the stomach in
health, and thus makes the blood rich. ALL CHllhMlfe-i-fe ana

THIN WOMEN !
A thin woman is not necessarily plain, let alone ugly ; In
fact, many thin women possess very pretty, “sweet faces, but
this is usually admitted with the qualifying phrase, but,
poor thing, she is so dreadfully thin.”
A woman’s chief charm is a well-rounded figure and a full
bosom. With these, thin arms and hollow cheeks are a rarity.
Thousands of women suffering the ravages of ill-health have
sought and accepted this advice, and to-day are models ot
womanly development and examples of perfect health. _
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere s
Flesh-Food is a harmless, perfect flesh-builder. It increases
the vitality and improves the general health. Some cases re-
port a gain in weight of over five pounds a week.
We want you to know just what “Flesh-Food” is, and will
gladly give you a free sample. Send 2d. stamp, and let us

I Food” is put up in tablet form, and can be secretly taken if
desired. All correspondence is confidential and private, and all

She sits in a verandah chan
From morn to night, it seems to me.
She scarce can find the time to spare
For breakfast, dinner or for tea.
tier mission is to keep a good ;■
Eook-out upon the neighborhood.
And very faithful to her trust —
Her self-appointed trust —is she >
She keeps her watch because she must;
It is her idiosyncrasy.
The Homan Guard compared to her
Was but a sleepy ofiicer —
I mean the Roman sentinel
Who, when the populace did roast
In Pompeii, as legends tell,
Stood stark and silent at his post —
He showed a valiant lack of sense,
But she has more intelligence.
And yet she is not lean and spare,
Thin-lipped and sour and gimlet-eyed,
As you might think —but fat and fair,
And as a market-waggon wide.
She looks when she is in full-dress '•< j
A “resting” Waxworks Giantess. 1
Good-humored, too; for she can give /
Back jest for jest with anyone;
In fact, she seems to me to live \
For sheer amusement —simple fun.
Yet she—though she has fun galore —
Is coarse unto the very core.
She thrives upon her neighbor’s ills,
Their weaknesses with her agree,
The word that hurts, the phrase that kills
Their characters, in store has she.
She seems to pray at morn and noon,
“God send bad luck to someone soon.”
She knows that Mr. Brown comes home
Drunk ev’ry night—which is a shame—
From pub to pub he likes to roam ;
But Mrs. Brown is most to blame,
Because she wears a face so grim
That home seems hell on earth to him.
Now, I’m a friend of Mr. Brown,
And know this yarn to be a lie.
I oft return with him from town,
And he is no more full than I.
And Mrs. Brown's a pleasant dame —
I wish all ladies were the same.
And Mrs. Jones, who likes to dress
Her girls in shining satinette,
As if each were a small princess,
Is over head and ears in debt.
She never pays a single cent
That she can help—and owes for rent.
I need not speak for Mrs. Jones,
Who well may spend her money free—
Her husband half a gold mine owns—
I wish I were as rich as he;
I would not live so poor and plain,
But bathe in buckets of champagne.
The Jackson girls, she says, are not
As good as they pretend to be.
Ere long their pa—a careless sot —
Some strange developments will see.
The Jackson girls, I know, are good
As any in the neighborhood.
She knows what meat or milk you buy;
How many times the jug you send
Unto the corner pub ; her eye
T Is on you all the time, dear friend.
You could not from its glare escape,
Unless you ’listed for the Cape.
She knows a man, across the way,
Pretending for the Press to write;
He seldom goes to town by day—
Because his work is done at night.
What is that work? Dark hints she throws;
It’s nothing honest — that she knows.
Sim sits in a verandah chair
From morn to night, it seems to me.
She scarce can find the time to spare
For anything—but Calumny.
Her mission is to keep a rude,
Black look-out on the neighborhood.
Ido not wish her harm; I do
Not hope bad luck will come to her.
The only thing—with her in view—
I wish for, and would see occur
Again—if men were not such fools—
The good old days of ducking-stools.

The town girl loves smart dresses,
The beach girl loves the sea,
And I love dimpled Doris,
And she loves me!
The beach girl loves the sunburst,
Wave-wash and golden sands,
The dazzling stars and moonlight,
And strong brown hands.
The town girl loves the lamplight,
Smooth words and motor trips,
But Doris gives me kisses
With wave-wet lips.
The town girl's cheeks are powdered
To match her artful gown,
But the sun for love o’ Doris
Kissed her cheeks of brown.
The brown girl’s mouth is rose-red,
A sweet voluptuous sin,
And Doris has a dimple
Each side her chin.
The town girl’s eyes are heavy
With watching for her fate;
But Doris, dream-eyed Doris,
Is my brown mate!
The town girl loves distraction,
Dance-parties, dainty teas,
But Doris shares my supper
Of bread and cheese.
The beach girl lives for laughter,
The clear blue skv above,
And Doris, dimpled Doris,
Was made for love.
The brown girl’s love is ardent;
She loves and laughs at fate . . .
An. Doris is my sweetheart,
And I’m her mate! • -

THE NEW CHINA.
China is making: history in great haste,
these days, and, unless appearances are de-
ceitful, the doom of the Manchu dynasty is
upon it. It has been a good old dynasty for
Australia, and this country has every reason
to send a flannel-flower or a waratah to the
funeral, and to drop a tear and a gum-tree
upon the grave. Something more than 250
years ago, in a time of civil war, rebellion
and commotion, a Tartar race came into
China, to assist one of the parties to the dis-
agreement, and it stayed there even unto this
day. The sun of old China set in blood.
The last fighting emperor—the Josiaii of
the falling monarchy —committed suicide with
the sword, and the last shadow-emperor —
the Jehoiachin or Zedetciaii who followed
on his heels —drowned himself grievously
in a muddy river, when his last hope had
pegged out. China became a land of
crushed women with club feet, and oppressed
men wearing pigtails. With the conquest,
there commenced the 250 years of nothing-
ness which did so much to give Australia the
chance whereof it has made less use than it
should have done. The Manchu emperors
brought in a horde of their countrymen to
prop up the throne. Their number is now
vaguely estimated at 4.000,000— perhaps only
one in 100 of the population, but sufficient
to be a very solid garrison. They are pen-
sioners, down to tiie youngest iuanchu in-
fant. Also, they are all soldiers, public
officials, or otherwise people of importance —
at least, they collect the pay that attaches
to the job, and, in a great measure, leave
the job undone. A thick-headed, liard-fight-
ing race of swordsmen were these Manclius
—among the world’s best fighters in the
days when men hacked and clubbed each
other at close quarters with ponderous wea-
pons of metal, and among the world’s worst
when warfare became a matter of science.
The Manchu Empire had feet of wood instead
of clay, and, when science became an ele-
ment of warfare, the white ant got into its
feet.
# * * *
Its position, in time, became profoundly
complicated. The thick-headed, foreign aris-
tocracy learned little of the new methods of
war, and developed more laziness, incapacity
and superciliousness every time it drew its
pension. It has been an utterly inefficient
and antiquated defence, both by land and
sea. The population which it was reckoned
safe to entrust with weapons only equalled that
of a second-rate European State, so China’s
huge numbers never really counted in armed
disagreement during modern days. The dy-
nasty dared not raise an efficient military
and naval force from among the Chinese, for
it felt that there would soon be no dynasty
left, if the patient, pig-tailed serf got arms in
his hands. So China was humble and peace-
ful over Alien Exclusion Eaws and other
things which it regarded as insults, and it
said little. It was licked by one enemy
after another, and it said just about nothing.
There was no real Chinese army, for the
Manchu emperors feared to have one, and,
even if the antiquated Manchu army had been
of much account, it couldn’t go far from
home, lest the throne and the jobs and the
pensions should all be gone before it came
back. The dynasty was somewhat in the
position of the embezzling clerk, who .can’t
take a holiday for fear the books may be
audited in his absence. It was a wretched,
temporary sort of business, and the end was
inevitable. The Russians and Japanese prac-
tically divided Manchuria, the ancient cradle
of the emperor’s race. The event involved
a grievous loss of prestige; it, to a great
extent, cut off the supply of possible recruits
to prop up the throne at Pekin in the day of
trouble; and it made the Manchus in China
a homeless folk. They became a mere hand-
ful of sailors, marooned on a raft in the
middle of a boundless, pigtailed sea. If they
didn’t create a solid Chinese army on modern
lines to defend the throne, it was obvious
that foreign nations would gradually eat up
the land, and the Manchu would have to flee
like mad and get work. If they did raise
such an army, it would probably stick its
bayonet into the stomach of the Manchu
system first thing. Still, there was a. possi-
bility that armed China might, under the
force of discipline, stand by the foreign kings
it had known so long, and even if China was
left unarmed, it was getting to a . point at
which it seemed liable to pelt the diminished
Tartar oligarchy to death with vegetables.
On the whole, it appeared best to flatter the
old crushed Chow with a show of confidence,
and to hope that a new habit of military
obedience might counteract the old habit of
disorganised hatred. So he was given a
rifle and a bayonet, and he promptly uttered
a loud yell of rage, and rushed at his old
Manchu friend. There are, of course, still
possibilities of a reaction. The insurgents
may start to disagree among themselves ; or
a Napoleonic Tartar may arise to save the
situation; or foreigners may intervene andi
prop up the rickety edifice for a while
longer. But, at time of writing, it looks as
if everything is up with the old Manchu
friend.^
If the Manchu is disembowelled and buried
by his ancient servant, the position is that
some 200,000,000 or 300,000,000 or
400,000,000 people who have, since long be-
fore the white man came to Australia, been
disqualified by internal dissensions for inter-
ference in foreign affairs, will be let loose.
In other words, that number will be added
to the possible enemies of Russia, Japan,
India and Australia. They may or may
not spend a long series of years in civil war
or in wild experiments in the art of govern-
ment. They may take to modern methods
with a rush, as the Japanese did, and create
an up-to-date fleet and army, compared with
which the resources of Russia and Japan will
look a very moderate proposition; or they
may reorganise slowly. But the fact remains
that the biggest possibility the world has seen
for 1000 years and more is growing up almost
in sight of Australia’s northern coast. That
the Chinese is a valiant fighting man is well
enough known. And there is always the
chance that the sight of blood —he has been
seeing more of it lately than the whole Aus-
tralian army could supply if it was slaugh-
tered twice over —may rouse him to a sudden
and violent career of aggression, just as the
Revolution did with France. That he is still a
most unpleasant fighter, with, a tendency to
arson, massacre and crucifixion, and pos-
sessed of a wild ingenuity in matters of tor-
ture, the recent troubles have clearly proved.
Within the last few days there have been
shown in Sydney photographs taken on the
spot, expounding Chinese death in its most
disagreeable aspect, including pictures of pris-
oners of war, still living, but with their flesh
hacked from their bones, and making a
drapery of horror that the Inquisition never
excelled in its worst days. It is also known
that the Chinaman is a great traveller and
trade adventurer. He used to be, and may
be again, a good deal. of a military adven-
turer. He is somewhat crowded up in his
own country. He considers he lias a griev-
ance to avenge in Australia’s exclusion laws.
He has learned to Enow Australia, and he has
a stupendous desire to get here, as evidenced
by the amazing devices adopted by the illicit
Chow immigrant. This is to him the
nearest country that offers a chance for
settlement on a large scale. It is the empti-
est country of any value on earth. And the
emptiest and least defensible part of it is
also the part that is most adjacent to a pos-
sible Chinese invader.
Amid all these circumstances it might be
supposed that Australia would be making
some slight effort for the settlement and
defence of that empty section . of Aus-
tralia which lies so unpleasantly close to
Asia, Curiously enough, it seems to be doing
rather less than usual. The railway to the
West is being pushed on, for there are votes
to be bought at the other end of it— at Kal-
goorlie and Perth ; but there are practically
no votes to be bought in the Territory until
people get a chance to go there, so Parlia-
ment hasn’t even been asked to consider the
question of surveying the railway route. It
has been proposed to appoint a single gener-
ally-useful official, at less than a bank
manager’s wages, to superintend this area of
523,000 square miles, but no appointment lias
yet been made. Some few' pounds have been
voted for various works in the Territory—
about enough to keep a third-rate munici-
pality going for a year. No scheme of settle-
ment has been propounded—it isn’t even sug-
gested that the Government has one to pro-
pound- The complete lack of defence is just
where it was, though, with Australia’s notable
army of infants, it is difficult to see how it
could be otherwise. The disaster of the
Northern Territory is the disaster of the
Closed Ports in a slightly different form.
Everything is subordinated to the acquisi-
tion of votes, which means that the business
of every politician is to spend public money
on the places where there is already a thick
population, with votes to dispose of. Even
the little that is done in the way of land
settlement is not apparently done for the sake
of settling land, but because land settlement
brings more trade to the great centres of
population, where the purchasable votes are
located. It is an absolute reversal of the
old pioneering spirit—but then political
support must be considered, and. for
the politician who doesn’t see beyond
the moment, political support lies where
the people are already located, conse-
quently an old slum is of more value
than a new Paradise. So Australia, im-
mersed in the problem of getting the Naval
College as close as possible to the S. M.
Herald’s office, is not invited by its rulers
to take any heed of the fact that the present
happenings in China may lead un to. the
biggest events in our history. Certainly,
they look like leading up to the biggest possi-
bilities in our history.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Exceeding Smallness of Australia in
Some People’s View.
The S. M. Herald’s parochialism appears
to have become a madness tnese clays. Tnat
paper was never reaiiy aware that there was
anytuing in Australia except N.S.W., and it
always showed signs ot a savage jealousy of
ail N.S.vV. that wasn’t close up against Syd-
ney. Nowadays, however, its radius seems
to be narrower than ever. This, for mtsance,
was how it commenced a frenzied leading
article one day last week: —
Apparently, after all, and in the face of the recom-
mendation of the expert, the Naval College of the
Commonwealth is not going to be in the neighborhood,
of Sydney, but will be placed in Federal territory
at Jervis Bay. It is a peculiarly ironic comment on
the way in which business is now being done that,
after many months of careful and unbiassed investiga-
tion, the leport of Captain Chambers should be
thrown to the winds, and a new site, AS FAli AS
POSSIBLE FROM SYDNEY, suggested. This, how-
ever, is only on a par with the policy of parochialism
which has dominated Federal administration from
the start.... The reasons why the Naval College
should be as close as possible to a great port ami
naval base, such as Sydney alone in Australia can
claim to be, hardly need seating.
Australia is a fairly big place, though the
FiERALD, for lack or an outlook beyond its
own murky otnee door, may be unable to see
it. This country of ours is pearly 10 times
tne size of N.S.W. It is more tnan 24 times
the size of the British Islands, _ where the
.Fairfax title came from, it is close on
5,U0U,0U0 times the size of Paddington, it
is so big that, if the south-eastern corner —
the one which contains Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide, .Launceston and Hobart —is cut
on the map, that geographical diagram looks
so little smaller that the difference may be
called imperceptible,. So great is it that it
is possible to travel about 1000 miles, as the
crow flies, while merely going from one pub-
lic-house to another. Supposing the Aus-
tralian Government had really wanted to put
the Naval College “as far as possible from
Sydney,” it could have put it 2200 rfules
away in a bee-line, and then have placed it
beside, a very good harbor —one of the
hundred or so that this country possesses,
and hardly even knows the name of. The
College could have been placed 350 miles from
Sydney, and still have been on the N.S.W.
coast. As it is, it is proposed to put it
about 90 miles from that city—a summer
afternoon’s motor-ride from the S. M.
Herald’s office door- —about two hours’ run
by rail, when the railway is completed. Yet,
to the Herald, the distance seems immense,
boundless, sublime, unbelievable and incom-
prehensible —likewise, darned insulting. It
appears the utmost possible limit. In the
selection of the site for the College, as in
the selection of the site for the Australian
capital, all the States save N.S.W. were dis-
qualified, lest the Herald and such-like Tory
papers, and the Tory politicians whom they
represent, should become angry and bash the
crockery around. Yet none of the other
States made any’ serious complaint. Ihen
more than three-fourths of the N.S.W. coast-
line were disqualified, presumably as being
too far from the S. M. Herald office. And,
after all these concessions, the Herald is
■about the maddest organ in Australia.
When it sits on its office stool and
looks out of its office window, the
Naval College isn’t in sight, and, not
being in sight, it must be far away
in savage and hostile lands, for the Herald s
idea of civilisation apparently extends just
as far as one can see from the Herald’s
office window. The Australian Government
made a considerable sacrifice of its honor to
placate papers like the Herald when it
threw overboard the Federal capital site
selected by its own expert (a high official
of the N.S.W. Lands Department), because
it wasn’t near enough to Sydney and the
offices of the Tory dailies of that city. It
ought to now realise that it might as well
have kept its eye fixed on the interests of
Australia, and stuck closely to business.
The only thing that can be said for Yassberra
is that it is conveniently within the circu-
lation radius, and under the journalistic in-
fluence of the S. M. Herald and its morn-
ing contemporary. In other words, when a
Democratic Federal Government takes up
its quarters at. that very dry spot, it will
be handy to the daily curse and the early
morning anathema of its most reliable ene-
mies, and will find their objurgation and
misrepresentation waiting beside its plate of
bacon at breakfast,
A Dream of the Future.
And, behold, “Henry Horsecollar" slept
and had a dream: —
I have been troubled all my life with a desire to
look ahead, and to find out what lies beyond. Now,
what lies on the other side of the present phase of
trades-unionism ? The immediate objects of the
movement, so far as I can see, are fourfold: (1) To
have a union for every trade, which is good ; (2) to
get every worker into the union, which is also good ;
(3) to consolidate the unions into a federation, which
no one can object to; and (4) to secure preference
to unionists, which is admirable. That is to say,
the first object is to acquire power, for it must he
acquired before it can be used. And when every
worker is in a union, I presume that preference to
unionists will mean preference to everybody, anil
surely nobody can object to that. Preference to
everybody, it seems to me, is the grandest idea ever
conceived by anybody, and if somebody wants to
object, 1 would like to know on what grounds. Then,
1 presume, the employers’ unions will all combine
into a union or federation, and every unionist em-
ployer will employ a unionist workman, because he
can’t get any other, and every unionist workman
will work for a unionist employer because there
won’t be any other, if there is a non-unionist left,
either workman or capitalist, he will be a lunatic in
an asylum, or he will be pensioned off as a curiosity,
and people will go to see him on Sunday, and take
their lunch with them, also 24 bananas in a brown
paper-bag. He will, in fact, become a sort of picnic
resort. People will call on him per motor-car or
omnibus, and some of them will drink champagne
outside him, and some will boil the billy alongside
him, and he will rank as a Jenolan cave or water-
fall or Blue Mountain. In fact, he will be what
Chowder Bav used to be to the Sydney push. Then,
in course of time, he will die —possibly of old age,
or perhaps through being nagged at by his wife—
and when he passes out a feeling of considerable loss
will ensue. For when everybody is in a union it is
much the same as nobody being in a union. There
is no joy in everybody being a Protestant if there is
nobody to protest against. Even the House of Lords
wouldn’t be quite what it is if it included the whole
nation ; and at the time when there were 2000
kings in Norway, preference to monarchs was not
always attainable. By the time all unions of em-
ployees are one union, and all unions of employers
are the same, an industrial disturbance will presum-
ably consist of everybody leaving off work; and as
it is impossible for everybody to leave off making
everything without somebody going short of some-
thing, or perhaps being without anything, the only
way out will be to abolish strikes. Presumably, that
wiil be done by the great workers’ union and the
great employers’ union amalgamating. Then no-
body can strike, because there will be nobody ex-
cept himself to strike against—until, as happened
recently with the Sydney wharf laborers, a section
of the union breaks 'out on its own in complete dis-
regard of the majority and the rules and the officials.
So everybody will be firmly leagued together against
nobody, and' that nobody will be a disunited entity,
or disembodied blackleg, and of no account at all.
Then the unions will die out, because there will be
no separated person to be combined against, and it
will be the same as a league of Primitive Methodists
to oppose the planet Jupiter. In fact, things will arrive
at last where they were before there were any unions.
After that, I suppose, affairs will start all over
again. If they don’t start all over again, I don t
see how there will be any affairs left. Anyhow, 1
hope some method of resuming the fight will be dis-
covered, for when there is nothing to strive for or
against —when it is all profound peace and all calm
and all summer Sunday afternoon —then dry rot will
s< t in, and the world become one vast Upper House.
The heavenly calm of dry rot passeth all under-
standing.
Democracy and the Collective Plate.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Saturday.—The Dean of St. Pauls (Dr.
Inge) delivered an address on industrial affairs yes-
terday at a meeting of the Women’s Diocesan Asso-
ciation. “Democracy,” Dr. Inge declared, is the
silliest of fetiches.” The transfer of industrial wealth
to Eastern Asia would be the certain sequel ot the
European labor movement. “A worse fate than that
will probably befall Australia,” he asserted, tor
Australia is within easy reach of the far more
efficient yellow industrials of the East. Cable item.
A very worthless thing is man,

The Victorian Elections.
The Victorian Labor party went into the
State election hopelessly—so hopelessly that
i't allowed 13 seats to go by default. It
comes out hopelessly, a little weaker than it
was before. It is not easy to regret its
defeat, for it is the poorest and most incur-
ably Tory affair of its kind in Australia.
The mere fact of a party calling itself
“Labor” doesn’t prevent it being Tory; in
fact, no name or label will in itself prevent
anything. Most of the Victorian Parlia-
mentary Laborists appear as men who have
given up the tight save as 'a matter of form,
and who have no faith in themselves. They
recite their creed, which is a good enough
bookish creed so far as it goes, in the per-
functory fashion of an old hired cleric recit-
ing the old formula, which, through years of
repetition, has become meaningless to him.
It is now almost as much an affair of habit
as the incurable M.L.C.’s statement that
“the time is not yet ripe.” There is no
brilliant orator or brilliant writer in the
party—no man who can move the multitude
—no man who seems to believe with a great
living belief. Once every three years Labor
speaks, its piece, and then resumes its job as
a stationary Opposition. If it would only
swear once with one good loud swear it
would be better than nothing. If it would
only do something brilliantly unusual for
once, there might be a chance for it. Even
'the throwing of a book at the Speaker
wouldn’t be .worse than the present stagna-
tion. Victoria, for long the leading State of
Australia, is now a land to hastening stodge
h prey, and drifts steadily towards the back
row. It. has an Upper House of unspeak-
able Tories, strongly entrenched behind the
property qualification of electors and the
property qualification of members. It has a
“Liberal” Ministry which has lost the
energy to really try to shift the Upper
House. It has an Opposition which has
given up any serious effort to shift either of
them. It has become a place which steadily
exports population and steadily loses its Fed-
eral membership for want of vigor to keep
up with the procession. It is dominated (1)
by its Upper House; (2) by its big land-
lords; and (3) by the overwhelming influ-
ence of Melbourne. The Upper House can’t
be reformed unless it is driven furiously and
by main force to assent to its own reform,
and nobody drives furiously or exceeds the
speed limit in the Victorian Assembly. The
big landlord is merely a subject of formal
protest. As for the absurd dead weight of
the Melbourne octopus, the Labor party
seems quite as much committed to the policy
of congestion as the Tory. It is a strange
fact that there lies, almost unknown, only
40 miles from Melbourne, a harbor which,
for size, depth of water and commercial pos-
sibilities is fully equal to Sydney; yet be-
cause of Melbourne jealousies, this asset re-
mains totally unused. Also, because of Mel-
bourne’s jealousy of Portland, the western
half of the little State remains almost un-
used. With such material for reform, a
leader with fire in his soul could rouse a
storm that would shake the old order of
things to its roots. But Prendergast and
his people lack the fire. They are more like
middle-aged aldermen than apbstles, and
more like deacons than incendiaries.

More About High Rents.
The wonderful Commission on High Rents
still sits in Sydney and struggles with the
too bulky orb of its fate. What it wants to
finu out is how to put far too many people
in far too little space without overcrowd-
ing ; how to let tue few houses available
close to the city to the highest bidder—he
being the person who naturally gets the
preference—without the rents going up;
how to arrange things so that the man who
lives six miles from his work will be as near
his work as the man who lives one mile
from his work; and how to fix things so
that the individual who resides an hour
away from his job will reach his job at the
same time as the man who lives alongside
his job without starting any earlier; also,
it wants to decide how he can get there as
cheaply without destroying the profits of the
tramway or railway system. In the course
of its recent proceedings it took evidence
from an Erskineville toiler of the more poorly
paid variety—an individual with nine chil-
dren and a landlord who had put up the
rent twice within 12 months. Being asked
to suggest a remedy, this testifier said
briefly:—
Let the State give the men assistance to build.
It is a manful way to deal with the matter,
and it would give a measure of present re-
lief, but it doesn’t looit like an adequate
remedy for the congestion and high rent
disease. It won’t enable people to live with-
out overcrowding where there is insufficient
room for them, and it won’t place the man
who is driven to live too far from his work
any nearer to his employment. He will
still suffer from lack, of adjacency to
his billet. No doubt, if the Govern-
ment lent the money cheaply, the
worker might buy a bit of land —just now
he would probably pay an absurdly high
price for the bit of land—and build a house
which would cost him less in interest than
he now pays in rent. But in time, perhaps
a very short time, he would die or remove
of be seized with the desire to make money,
and he would sell or let the little tenement
that the State had helped him to acquire.
And, probably, he would sell or let at the
best figure he could tret, and the attempt to
lower rents by State assistance would thus
be obliterated. Nearly 20 years ago, Minis-
ter McKenzie, of Maoriland, assisted a
tremendous number of poor people to
get on the land on easy terms. He
was full of sympathy for them, and
he helped them lavishly, with the
result that many of them became well-off,
and turned Tory, and sub-let the cheap land
at high rates, and left off working, and ac-
quired a great scorn for the poor, and lost
all sense of gratitude to McKenzie. This
problem is indirectly related to the freehold
v. leasehold controversy. There is a beauti-
ful streak of poetry about the proposition
that every man wants to own the home he
lives in, and that, therefore, the State should
sell land instead of leasing it. But the folk
of tfie second or third generation are mere
tenants again. The only differences are that
their rent is collected, not by the State, but
by the individual to whom the State sold
cheaply in order that the possession of the
freehold might round off and complete his
beautiful home life; and that he charges
about three times as much rent as the State
would do. There is no remedy to be found
for the rack-renting curse by giving small
men assistance to become freeholders unless
Some guarantee can be found that they won’t
let their tenements —neither they nor their
descendants; that they won’t sell to mere in-
vestors or speculators, but only to occupiers;
and that they won’t annex or take or grab
or realise the unearned increment in any
shape or form, for if they do they are shov-
ing up the rent (or interest bill) to the old
exorbitant figure. It is a solemn fact that
the existence of the old landed nobility of
England was largely due to the fact that the
State assisted on to the land thousands of
small freeholders many of whom, despite
the glamor that history has cast over them,
were just about as poor as the recent witness
at Erslrineville. And they took the unearned
increment, and became rich and Tory, just
as did the deadly poor settlers whom “Jock”
McKenzie, of Maoriland, helped on to the
soil less than 20 years ago, and just as many
others would do with “State assistance to
build” for their starting point. State owner-
ship of cities might meet the case, but State
assistance to create a new race ot city land-
lords is a mere shifting of the evil along for
a few years.

A Lost Industry.
The good Australian in dungarees will see
no reason for throwing up his hat in the
statement that there has been an increase of
over 20,000 tons in the coastal steamship
trade since 1808. He hasn’t had a chance
to build any of it. The further statement
that new steamers totalling 42,000 tons are
now on order or building will most likely
move him to drag oft his hat and leap on it,
also throw his spanner through the engine-
room skylight. Eor lack of a stiif import
dutv on ships (say 50 per cent.), all this
work is being done on the other side of the
world, and Australia is losing the chance of
starting and getting a vitaily-important in-
dustry on an even keel before the day of
trouble comes. It is also losing (1) the
wages of the men employed; (2) a fine op-
portunity of helping tile struggling steel in-
dustry and most other trades; (8) the ex-
perience; (4) a mighty fine world advertise-
ment such as the Compulsory Service scheme
and the starting of the Australian Navy gave
us; (5) an 18-carat inducement to skilled
artisans to immigrate. With regard to the
last loss, it may be pointed out that intelli-
gent specialists don’t want to go out to
savage places where the ignorant and unre-
sourceful inhabitants merely sit down on the
seafront and order things from well-equipped
manufacturing centres. Whichever way you
look at it, this wholesale ordering of ships
from abroad is a dismal business. It holds
Australia back, and it does a good deal to-
wards propping up our Ereetrade Father
Bull, and helping to keep the troublesome
Cobden jim-jam kicking. The importing
curse comes home to roost with both claws
when the Ereetrade maniac points to Bull’s
fine shipbuilding industry when arguing with
the Australian re the alleged disadvantages
of Protection.
The Perry-Willis Situation.
The N.S.W. Full Court decided, last week, in
effect, that if Onslow, or any other perfect
gentleman, throws an ink-bottle at the
Speaker, and then bolts for the door, and
waits on the mat to watch the Chair wipe
the fluid out of its ears, the Chair has no
authority to send the Sergeant to lift the
rioter back into the Chamber for correction.
John Perry had misbehaved and then
bolted. Willis sent for him, and “ar-
rested” him, and had him brought in to toe
the mark. Now, Perry is wanting £lOOO
for assault and “imprisonment.” Willis
filed his defence; Perry demurred to part
of it, and three Judges, after wrestling with
the demurrer, decided that the defence was
no good, The Speaker had only the rights of
the chairman of a public meeting, they said.
Pring, J., put it this way:—
The question is simply this: Has such a chairman
the rig-lit to bring back to the meeting any person who
has left it and gone about his own business? That
he has the right to remove a person who has ob-
structed the business of a meeting is not denied.
But when the offending person has left the meeting,
so that, so far as he is concerned, the cause of the
disorder has been removed, the authority of the
chairman over him is at an end. He has ceased to
form one of that bodv of persons who, by assembling
together under the presidency of one of their num-
ber, have implicitly given him the right to maintain
order during the progress of the proceedings.
It may be all right; all the same, there is
a difference between a mere bloke who wan-
ders into a public meeting casually and a
member of Parliament who wanders into his
place of business every day. When the mere
bloke wanders out of the meeting, he has
“ceased to form one of that body of persons
who have implicitly given the chairman the
right to maintain order”; but when the
M.P. wanders out of the Chamber, he hasn’t
“ceased to form one of that body of persons
who;” etc. There is a continuity about
Parliament that there isn’t about the
other thing; and, though the disorder at one
public meeting wouldn’t be liable to affect
the behavior of the probably different people
who attended subsequent public meetings, the
defiance of the Speaker in one sitting of
Parliament would be very liable to cause
trouble in precisely the same crowd of people
at the next sitting. The Full Court is right,
of course, until a Fuller Court says it’s
wrong; but, even if the Fuller Court says it
is right, there seems to be a pretty good rea-
son why it should say that some, anyhow, of
its arguments are pretty rotten.

Where the Assassin Scores.
Ohe of the reasons why murder after murder
goes undetected in Australia, is that the
system of investigating such crimes is un-
organised. A citizen is butchered. After
a while the police drift along and view the
remains. A few doctors —any old or very
young doctors —follow and proceed to do
with the corpse practically what they will.
By the time they have finished, the chances
of a really astute detective, or a specialist
in pathology, discovering anything of value
for the purposes of Justice have been re-
duced by about 50 : per cent. The Police
Department ought to have a definite set of
rules, after the German model, that would
apply rigidly to all murder cases. The best
available pathologist, with experience in
medico-legal work, should be permanently
retained by the Government. Immediately
upon a murder being reported, he should pro-
ceed, as a matter of course, to the place of
carnage (certain exceptions being made as
regards cases where the body is so remote
from civilisation that only a flying patholo-
gist could get there before it is unrecognis-
able). He should be attended by the least
futile member of the detective force that
is around. And no outsider should accom-
pany them. The pathologist's job, in this
connection, is the highly technical one of
collecting and piecing together evidence from
the medical point of view. On the Euro-
pean continent his first act is to take photo-
graphs of the body and its surroundings.
The attitude of the body, and its relation to
the various objects in the room is carefully
noted. The wounds are described, and, if
necessary, deductions are drawn from them
as to the nature of the weapon used. An
earnest hunt is made for hair, blood, finger
prints and the like, and, as care is taken to
prevent the public and the street police from
trampling these out before the experts ar-
rive, traces are often quite numerous. These
are duties which demand, in many cases, the
very best intelligence and experience that
are to be got. The Trevascxjs murder pro-
vided a notable example of the sloppy or
casual method of investigating crime. After
the corpse had lain undiscovered for some
days, a relative found it, and called in a
local policeman. He appears to have mooched
dazedly round for a while, after which some
lesser lights of the detective force transpired ;
also the Police Surgeon (Dr. Palmer), one
of the Glebe practitioners, and a medical
friend of theirs. Even if all these gentlemen
happened to be specialists in medico-legal
work, which they aren’t, the principle under
which they were called in remains rotten.
The Government should retain its own
pathologist-—the very best available—and
his skill and knowledge should be
sought on every possible occasion, whe-
ther the slaying was done at Potts
Point or at Bourke. No particular
damage occurred in the Glebe case, the
medicoes employed being a skilful lot, and
the crime, in any event, being obvious enough,
up to a certain point. But it is easy to
picture a situation where this system of
turning on to the job the first doctor or
sleuth that comes handv, would produce
amazingly satisfactory results—from the
assassin’s point of view.
“Harrison O.” : Barracking in favor of sec-
tarian religious instruction in State schools,
a number of the churches in Victoria issued
a pastoral letter mentioning that at his cor-
onation, the King formally hoped “we may
never cease to cherish our noble inheritance
m the English Bible, which is the first of
national treasures.”. “And,” cried the Grange-
tinted letter, “this is the book which is ex-
cluded from our State schools. Is Victoria
to be the only State in the Commonwealth
from whose schools the Bible is prohibited V”
As a matter of fact, the Bible is not ex-
cluded from the schools; and, presumably,
the persons who concocted the letter, and
who sign themselves “H. L. Melbourne,”
“John D. Bendigo,” and “T. H. Wangar-
atta ” know that it is not. Under the 1905
regulations of the Education Department,
any authorised religious teacher —profes-
sional or amateur—is permitted to expound
the Scriptures to any juvenile whose parents
desire that it should be taught; and, under
this regulation, over 50,000 kids in the State
schools are receiving regular religious in-
struction at the present time. So the re-
marks about the Word being “excluded” and
‘prohibited” look like a deliberate attemnt
to mislead those who do not happen to be
well informed a.s to the departmental regula-
tions. Cynics will say, pernaps, that every
sort of clerical utterance is an attempt to
mislead people who don’t know any better,
and don’t want -to.
Tiie Bulletin's Minister for Slaughter
writes about Dreadnoughts, golf and eggs:—
War is a game in which each piayer is allowed
to make his own rules —as long as he wins. It is
like a game of golf, in which one player might at
any moment hit the other with the tee, and the
other could retaliate with a straight stymie to the
stomach. And the management of it is too often
left to the aged and upright expert, who had never
thought of felling his opponent with a heavy bogey,
or the carrying of a tomahawk. Now and then, un-
pleasant things are said to that honest but methodi-
cal person. For instance, my confr&re, the military
correspondent of London Times, has just written
this:—
“I think that the North Sea falls within the cate-
gory of narrow waters, which eventually must, by
the invention and development of the airship, the
submarine, the torpedo and the mine, become prac-
tically closed on the outbreak of war, and possibly
throughout the war, to the operations of sea-going
fleets and cruisers. I think that the great ships to
which we devote so much money each year—though
they have been, are, and may for a few years more
be necessary—will within a limited period of time
become useless for most operations, of which the
North Sea and the Channel will be the theatre.”
In the time of war, he says
“Swarms of destroyers and submarines, and everv
year more of the latter, will infest the North Sea,
and the existence of every great ship venturing to
cruise in the area controlled by these pests, which
are almost unassailable by naval means, will be
most precarious. Our great and costly battleships
and cruisers must be stowed away safely in some
distant, safe and secluded anchorage. . . . The
North Sea, in the time of war, will be a desert of
waters insecure to both sides, open to neither, com-
manded by none. Britannia may rule the waves,
but who will rule above and below them?”
Arthur Rae lias a proposal before the
Senate to . allow Papua a voice in the Com-
monwealth Parliament, but not a vote. Some
“concession” of the kind certainly ought to
be granted. When the Australian Govern-
ment sees a part which needs the special
attention of the Commonwealth, and which
shrieks out for white population to avert a
national catastrophe, it may, under certain
conditions, take it over as a Territory. And
then, apparently to discourage citizens from
going where citizens are wanted most urg-
ently, it disfranchises everybody who does
go. Why should these mostly extra-good
Australians lose their fights as citizens, sim-
ply because they are doing Australia’s job
in a place where few are willing to tackle itV
Already the Australian Government,
cramped up in its silly little bit of Federal
capital territory, is reduced to buying scraps
of adjoining land. It made such an acquisi-
tion, the other day, at Jervis Bay, where an
extra fragment of elbow-room was needed
for defence purposes. But it didn’t get the
fragment in full sovereignty—it rather ac-
quired it as a private freeholder might do.
subject to State laws and interferences. The
I ederal capital site now consists of a weird
and wonderful series of patches. There is
(1) a few hundred square miles at Yass-
berra belonging absolutely to the Common-
wealth; (2) some shadowy claims over ad-
jacent water supplies (these hardly amount!
to any more than an unsupported assurance
that the S'tate authority will preserve the
water from defilement) ; (3) the right to run
a railway line trom Yassberra to Jervis Bay
(this right is so strictly limited that it
doesn’t even include the use of water along
the route, though the fluid may, perhaps, be
obtained on sufferance) ; (4) three or four
square miles at Jervis Bay for a “port” (this
ends at higli-water mark, so there can be no
ships at the “port,” and if a town arises at
the “port,” there is no catchment area to
supply it with drinking water) ; (5) the 5000
or so recently purchased acres, of which the
State reserves the mineral rights, etc., so
that the Commonwealth is a sort of lodger.
It all represents about the most abject and
cowardly fooling away of a great opportun-
ity that could well be imagined. And the
men who were mainly responsible hadn’t
even the merit of professing to believe that
they were acting for the best. They did a
turncoat act, apparently at the bidding of
certain Tory papers, which went mad at the
idea of a big, prosperous Federal city and
seaport with the private landlord elimin-
ated. And the turncoats lost their re-
ward, for their degradation didn't secure
the support or placate the animosity of these
papers worth a cent.
A very few weeks ago that highly capable,
even brilliant muddler, N.S.W. Attorney-
General Holman, announced that Henry
Willis had been secured as Speaker on the
agreement that no “contentious” legislation
would be introduced, and that the Assembly
would be dissolved as soon as the redistribu-
tion of seats was fixed up. Now, having-
secured a majority again, the Government
goes on with highly “contentious” legislation,
and laughs the wi'd caechinat'ion of scorn
when its pledge is alluded to. The making of
the agreement in the first place was, per-
haps, not specially wise. The revelation of
the fact that there was a specific agree-
ment of any sort was a sorrowful evidence
that silence is golden, while needless and
misdirected conversation is mud. And the
breakage of the agreement for the sake of a
dubious momentary advantage suggests
George Washington selling his reputation
at a bargain sale price. For practical pur-
poses, to be honest and to look honest are the
same thing. They may not be the same
thing in a moral sense, but they are both
remunerative when there are brains to back
them up—especially the latter. Probably it
pays best to be dishonest and look honest;
second-best to be honest; worst of all, to
look dishonest whether you are dishonest or
not. In a political sense, the McGowen
Ministry is drifting into the third category,
when it might have been in the second or the
first —and all by reason of a blatantly, elo-
quent man who didn’t know when to put
in the plug. A politician should always
know when to put in the plus-, and, at the
same time, lie shouldn t let anyone suspect
that there is any plug, because that implies
a hole, and whenever people learn that there
is a 'hole, they want to know which hole it is.
In a financial way, S. Aus. is a Wowser
State which strains at gnats and swallows
camels. It declares that a small proportion
—4 per cent. —of the total public debt shall
be wiped off out of revenue every year, and
all the surplus revenue has to go the same
&ood_ way; and thus in the past five years
£2,159,991 has been paid in towards getting
the country out of pawn. But. while the
State has paid in £2,159,991 with one hand,
it has dragged out £5,565,883 with the other,
so that the net result is that it is £3,405,892
deeper in pawn than it was before it paid
in anything at all. And while the Wowser
State has thus gone forth wearing the hymn
hook of a blameless life in its button-hole,
and the rum-bottle of the man who sees
snakes in its tail-pocket, it has been swell-
ing its alleged income and faking its sur-
pluses by counting all its land-sales money
as revenue. Six years ago this utterly ficti-
tious revenue —it is really the conversion of
assets —amounted only to £30,765; but
latterly the Wowser has gone more and more
enthusiastically on the jamboree, and land-
sales money has been bounding along this
way
1906 ..£48,045 1909 ..£80,855
1907 . . 53,287 1910 . . 155,387
1908 .. 61,745 1911 .. 274,137
Altogether the State’s “surplus” last year was
alleged to be £287,188, and out of that the
statutory 4 per cent, has to come for the re-
duction of debt. That small slice was
£6.9,991; yet, apart from land-sales money,
there was really only a surplus of £13,051
Consequently, if the State didn’t reckon as
revenue an amount which isn’t revenue at
all, and which even the not over-particular
Government of N. S. Wales refuses to re-
gard wholly as revenue, S. Aus. would have
had a mere £13,051 towards its statutorv
obligation to pay off £69,991. And if things
work out like that in what is admitted to
have been about the most prosperous year
in the State’s whole history, Heaven only
knows what is going to happen in a year
when the hot wind singes the S. Australian
cocky’s whiskers and blasts the rest of his
stock-in-trade,

“Horsewool” : I’d be as grieved as the pub-
lic would be astonished to see a week go by
without the N.S.W. Law ass being driven
along the road of ridicule. This time the
long-eared animal earned his helping of sap-
ling over the case of a Manning River
(North Coast) person, who was charged
with selling fire-water without as much as
saying, “By your leave,” to the authorities
made and provided for the purpose. The
Bench that tried the case was composed of
one Police Magistrate and four J’s.P., and
the latter, voting down the P.M., decided
that the offence alleged was not proved. At
this, the animal that lives on car-
rots, or ought to, demanded that the J’s.P.
should state a special case for the Pull
Court, which, being done, the old, unreliable
mule harnessed up and hauled it to that
august assembly. No sooner had the docu-
ment been handed up, however, than the
learned Horsewool, who was appearing for
defendant, disrespectfully remarked that the
signature of the dissenting P.M. had not
been obtained for the special case; that the
only signatures appearing were those of the
J’s.P. Whereupon the case collapsed, and the
State’s common or garden quadruped was
led out by the ear, with a bill of costs tied
to his tail.
♦—
It is understood that the N.S.W. State
Premier will put up a scrap like one pos-
sessed of a devil (unless he thinks better of
it) to prevent the State Savings Banks
being absorbed by the new Commonwealth
Bank. If the Commonwealth institution
doesn’t buy up the framework of some of
the big and less extravagantly valued pri-
vate banks, like the Commercial of Aus-
tralia, Queensland National, or A.8.C., it
will have to build a connection by doing
business —especially of the savings bank
variety—through the post offices. So the
State Savings Banks, which now use the
Federal Post Office on sufferance, must
either amalgamate or go to the ex-
pense of hiring separate offices in which to do
their business, and in many places the cost
will be absurdly large for the business. As
it was the failure of the State Governments
to found State Banks of issue which made
the Commonwealth Bank necessary, the cheap-
est and sanest line of conduct, and the best
in the public interest, is to let it have the
whole job. But, so far, there is a wild in-
clination to “blew” some of the State de-
positors’ profits on a fight in the alleged in-
terests of State dignity. One Sydney daily
got so wild as to seriously propose, last
Monday, that the N.S.W. State Government
(which is supposed to believe strongly in
public enterprise) should hire private banks
as its agents, out of sheer hatred of public
enterprise when it is Australian, and not
purely local, public enterprise.
Nowadays, the Freetrade papers of Australia
preach Freetrade mostly because they are
certain there is no chance of getting the
loathsome thing, so they can keep up an ap-
pearance of r consistency on the cheap. At
times they forget to hide their real con-
victions, and then they publish things that,
20 years ago, would have filled them with
horror. For instance, this was the begin-
ning of a yarn (headed, among other things,
“Decay in Britain”) which appeared in
last Monday’s Sydney E. News :
We had the carriage to ourselves. My companion,
a working man of some sort, in early middle life,
clean, civil and wistfully lean, was going up to
London in search of work. As to what sort of
work he was less sure. He had a trade, but it was
a dead trade. He was an English spectacle-maker.
I learned with surprise that, except for repairs and a
limited demand for patents and fancy articles, there
is nothing doing now in spectacles. Nobody wears
English-made to-day. Foreign competition has killed
the trade. My informant said so, and he should have
known. Born in a spectacle-maker’s family, he had
worked at it all his life, and owned himself beaten.
FREETRADE HAD RUINED HIM.
♦-
An 'airman attributes many deaths of his
brethren to ethereal asphyxia, which he des-
cribes as “a dreamy feeling which comes
over you, causing loss of control and an irre-
sistible desire to sleep.” Does anyone know
for certain whether Victoria’s Premier Weary
has ever been up in an aeroplane?
Sidelights on the pugilist’s life. Frank
Bungardy—he fights under his real name —
being sued for maintenance of his wife and
child in Adelaide, swore that he only got £7
out of his last fight, and of that he paid £5
for the setting of his fractured jaw. As that
injury will keep him out of the ring for four
months, he is going back to his trade as a
painter’s “improver.”
There were some curious items about
Victoria’s Assembly election. One was the
position of ex-schoolmaster Dawborn, who
last election came within six votes of dis-
placing gasman Swinburne, for Hawthorn.
Swinburne should have lost votes owing to
his connection with the Gas Co., yet this
time Dawborn actually forfeited his £5O.
Out Kew way, again, Frank Madden only got
home in 1908 by 11 votes from Lumsden;
last week he polled six to every four given
to an equally well-known local man. On
the other hand, Trenwith, who eight years
ago topped the Victorian poll for the Senate,
could only get two votes to every three given
to the unique Sale saddler, McLachlan, and
that in a notoriously Protectionist district.
Yet the one-time democrat was “out” long
before the dissolution, and had canvassed
the electorate thoroughly.

The public is hereby invited to keep its eye
fixed on the George Titheradge benefit. The
wear and tear of the eye will be infinitesimal
and the reward will be immense. The event
is a matinee, and is to happen at Her Ma-
jesty’s (Sydney), on Thursday, November
30. All the best dramatic and musical
people now in Sydney are willing to assist,
and as many as can find space on the pre-
mises will do so. The fact that George Tith-
eradge was among the very finest actors that
Australia ever saw is too well known to the
middle-aged generation of playgoers to re-
quire recitation, and that part of the younger
generation which hasn’t seen him will take
the fact on trust, if it hasn’t lost all respect
for its elders. “Tith.” was one of the bright-
est stars of the old Brough and Boucicault
co. in the long ago time when that co. was
all stars. If there was ever in Australia a
company which beat it for all-round excel-
lence, the address thereof is not known at
this office. With a view to the fact that the
dimensions of a theatre are limited, while
the merits of the case are wholly unlimited,
those who are unable to attend are cordially
invited to express their feelings in cash, and
forward the same to Mr. Lachlan Beaton, or
to Mr. Leonard Dodds (hon. treasurers),
c/o the Royal Agricultural Society, Ocean
House, Moore-street, Sydney. They are
both at the same address and the money can
be sent to either of them, or if the sub-
scriber is of a hesitating nature, like an ass
languishing between two haystacks, he may
double the amount and send to both of them.
The largest donations will be thankfully re-
ceived.

Though the second act of “The Girl in the
Train,” at the Criterion, is merely the second
act of all the other “Girls” —possibly due to
the fact that a girl is exactly like any other
girl, and frequently more so, after you know
her an hour —the divorce case in the first act
is sufficiently humorous to fill the court in
its third week.

Nicola, who is in the wizardry and illu-
sion line of business and speaks with a
United States voice, will happen at the Pal-
ace on December 2. He recently gladdened
Melbourne for a brief season, and the press
of that city reported on him favorably. When
one considers how many illusions are around
a big city at horse-carnival times, it says a
lot for Nicola that he kept his head above
the ruck.

Shamrock is still growing -wild at the
Adelphi; “A Romance in Ireland” is the
botanical name of the second crop. Allen
Doone and his company are still in charge of
the vegetable, and although this crop doesn’t
promise as well as the first, there shouldn’t
be any need to appeal to the Government for
seed for the next harvest. The plot is laid
in County Mayo, and the four acts are tied
together with a love yarn, wherein a very
tame villain tries to tear asunder the mar-
riage tie. The scene which catches on best
is a scrap in a bedroom at midnight ; there
is plenty of in-fighting and furniture smash-
ing, and the curtain drops with the room
looking as though an insane earthquake had
come home late and mistaken its lodgings.
Allen Doone as Larry O’Daly, the conven-
tional happy Irishman, scores another hit, and
plays some very good bits on his pipes. Edna
Keeley (who is Norah Doyle, and Norah
Doyle, it may be mentioned, is Larry’s girl,
and Larry is a bhoy of great tonnage) hangs
on to the good name she got on her first ap-
pearance. Ronald Riley, as the person who
tries to rend the marriage tie, and Clive
Farnham and Gladys Bancroft, who get
married, are the best of the others. There
are also Biddy and Mickey, but that
statement is almost superfluous. When was
there an Irish play that didn’t include Biddy
and Mickey?
Comedian J. P. Ling added himself to the
Tivoli bill last week-end after a subtraction
of three years. Ling has a quiet stage man-
ner and a good voice, which enables him to
really sing his songs, instead of talking or
howling them. He also possesses a fine gift
of mimicry, and his imitations of a football
barracker and a small wheezy band are good
enough to travel by themselves. Hanvarr
and Lee’s breezy juggling and athletic act is
another bright section of the second part,
which is likewise inhabited by Johnson
and Dean, the colored high steppers. The
lady partner’s exquisite stage costumes, last
week, included one dress which had as train
a summer morning cloud captured by some
costume composer soon after sunrise. Ridi-
culous Recco, the burlesque acrobat, Bari-
tone Ossipoff and the Rees Trio are other
headliners. Sam Mayo is droning away his
last nights, and preparing to look unhappy
elsewhere.
At West’s in Sydney (the Glaciarium),
the romantic miss has been given a beautiful
six-penn’orth during the week, for a very
fine film has been showing how Lady Mary
can still fall in love with an ’umble game-
keeper. At the same house Shamus O’Brien
(“Rory O’More”) has been wearing the
green amidst great applause. The West
establishment threatens to become serious.
A new film, “A Victim of the Mormons,” is
to expose the “pernicious doctrines of the
MormOn faith,” and it will raise such a
storm of indignation that Motmonism will
droo dead in Darlinghurst, and the abomin-
able tenets of the Prophet Smith will hide
their diminished head amid the. boundless
plains of Tom Ugly’s Point.
* * * *
“Rory O’More,” founded on the well-
known story of distressful Ireland, was the
star film at Spencer’s Lyceum during the
week. “The Old Captain,”' a picturesque
story of sea life; “The Squaw’s Love,” the
usual Indian yarn; and “Two Wolves and a
Lamb,” a study of two thieves and their
guardian angel, were also given prominent
places, while sortie good Turlcish-Dago war
pictures were served up on the screen.
“ALIAS JIMMY VALENTINE
AT THE SYDNEY ROVAL.
Jimmy Valentine punctures the heart of Susie
Vaughan, of the Gate of Hope Society, and
sundry other ladies.
“Alias Jimmy Valentine” makes way for
a revival of “The Sign of the Cross,” at Syd-
ney Royal, on Friday night. William Des-
mond, who is identifiable as a product of
N’York, at from two to 400 yards, according
to the eyesight of the observer, is to play
Marcus ; and the spectacle should be worth
taking a long, hot, dusty journey to see.

The National Amphitheatre is first in the
local vaudeville field, or paddock, with one of
those playlets which have been booming, of
late, in the gilded halls of London. Miss
Beaumont Collins and David Baird are the
responsible parties, and they present a sketch
hight “The Leaves of Memory,” which is
worth sitting through. For the rest, there
are Lordy’s dogs, Tom Lee, who' accuses him-
self of being “a Society Comedian,” Arm-
strong and Verne, and others of merit.

“The Chocolate Soldier” is still devouring
caramels at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), and
Miss Winifred O’Connor continues to pro-
vide the confectionery. The Strauss music
is quite satisfactory; if the “book” were as
good, the play would be much better than it
is, . A' - ■ ■'

H. B. Irving, still following in father’s
footsteps, makes an easy change from “The
Lyons Mail” to “Louis X 1.,” at Adelaide
Royal. His Lesurques is less saint-like, and
his Dubose less fiendish than his father was ;
he seems more concerned to be real than
merely to make an effective ‘‘character.” The
other members of the co. improve on ac-
quaintance, and Miss Dorothea Baird has
shown her best work, as a Cavalier maid, in
a curtain-raiser. The Tivoli has strengthened
its bill with Clark and Hamilton, fresh from
their heavy scoring in Sydney, and Hairy
Alister, whose impersonations vary from fair
to good. The King’s is strong on the ath-
letic side, with the Piquays on the top of the
bill. This house connects with Brennan’s
fixture-list. West’s, who are building, have
been starring a drama which teaches young
women not to be Mormons; Wondergraph,
which is going to build, has relied on “Mar-
garet Oatchpole” ; and the Empire makes a
■ bold bluff of having had an operator at the
Battle of Trafalgar. The midgets of Tiny
Town, haying done tremendous business at
Broken Hull and places in between, have
looked in again at the Exhibition on their
way to Victoria; and in the grounds _of the
same building Branscombe’s “Dandies" have
good houses in the warm evenings that have
set in.

From an Adelaide critic :—-
The annual Federal show of the Society of Arts in
Adelaide gives the State Art Gallery a chance of
spending or so out of the Elder bequest in en-
couraging Australian painters. Most of those already
represented in the Elder Room are showing again
this year. J. S. Watkins sends a heavy girl in a red
kimono, and the same lady (asleep) in yellow satin,
while husband (presumably) reads the paper. The
latter picture is cynically entitled “Charmante
Soirfie.” D. Rubbo has his powerful newsboys, Nor-
man Carter two ladies with a black cat, and Bessie
Davidson a blue girl who has been in the Paris
Salon. D. M. Meldruin, formerly a Travelling
Scholar of Victoria, has a striking old-man study, and
Miss Sweatman another of a youth. Also, there are
various portraits and single figures ; but hardly any-
body ventures on composition to the extent of two
figures in one picture, and over all is the seemingly
incurable tendency of our men to draw faces that are
plain—or worse. English or French or American
artists, of not half the local men’s power, learn, first
thing, to draw pretty faces and figures as a matter
of course; and so they get commissions. Westralia
makes a welcome appearance. Ellis Silas is am-
bitious, with a vivid painting of Australian “de-
stroyers” and a bold, successful Duteh-and-English
sea fight. Daisy Rossi is also from Perth, and also
worth watching. Landscapes are many and good.
Lister-Lister has only one, marvellously red and
green, light-colored and clean. Ford Paterson shows
a characteristically faint and wan Gippsland scene,
Miss Sweatman a bush bit, and Albert Hanson a
batch of water-colors from the farm. Of the local
men, Hayley Lever sends from St. Ives a brisk paint-
ing (which has hung in the Academy) of that
crowded port. Hans Heysen has a restful batch of
water-color gums, and various people are imitating
him. Will Ashton shows a Narrabeen Lake and
sundry seascapes. His father, James Ashton, sticks
to the sea and shore, and is probably painting better
just now than ever before. Edward Davies keeps up
a good average. George Webb flies to landscape as
a change from his more profitable portrait-painting.
John White —just elected President of the Society of
Arts- —is quiet this year, but G. A. Barhes. shows
figures in a garden, and a charming Hills landscape,
and is the most improved local painter of the year.

“Dame Nature,” staged at Melbourne
Royal, last Saturday, is an interesting ex-
ample of the faulty theatrical play which
achieves a passing success in London, on the
merit of the acting of its leading performer,
but is bound to be “turned down’’ by an Aus-
tralian audience, because it is neither stirring
melodrama, sparkling comedy, nor simple
foolishness. Miss Ethel Irving gives a posi-
tively great interpretation of a character
which, being devoid of intellectual force, is
swayed by only one pugnacious emotion.
She stands for feminine human nature in its
most undignified pose. None of the other
characters make a strong appeal to popular
sympathy, the story has only a painful inter-
est, and much of the dialogue is without any
dipect bearing on the plot. As compared
with “Lady Frederick,” m which 95 per cent,
of the conversation goes to make the story
interesting, “Dame Nature” is a badly-built
play. Doubtless it has lost artistic virtue
in adaptation from the French original.
* * * *
Robert Bertram has achieved the Medal of
Honor picture at the Paris Salon, and, when
the news is brought to him in the cafe, he
promptly proposes to marry the girl who was
the nude model for his masterpiece. They
have lived three years together. She has
“kept house” for him in his poverty. She
is very pretty, artlessly emotional, hopelessly
“Bohemian,” entirely devoted to him in her
picturesque, vulgar way. Bertram, unfor-
tunately, is rather a snob, and his art_ aggra-
vates his gentility. Sassiety people visit Ins
house (where the studio adjoins the drawing-
room), and a princess ogles him whilst he is
painting her portrait. The prince, her hus-
band, is merely a cynical old ruin, whom she
bought for his title, and she is ready to get
a decree nisi if the painter will divorce his
wife and marry her. Tempestuous Lolette
discovers her adored husband making love to
the princess. She “carries on” vulgarly.
Her hysterical grief is harrowing. Again,
she interrupts the course of illicit flirtation,
and makes another scene. A third time she
disturbs the lovers in their converse, and
then, after a series of tumultuous upbraid-
ings, impotent threats and pathetic appeals,
she realises the fact that Bertram loves the
princess for her rank and culchaw and com-
manding comeliness. Whereupon, the poor
little woman throws up the sponge, and
goes away and tries to kill herself. Any-
how, the audience hears in the last act that
Lolette tried to kill herself. It then appears
that Bertram and the princess couldn’t live
together contentedly. Lolette’s unreason-
able persistence in demanding her husband’s
allegiance, her frenzy and despair, had cast
a gloom over her amour. So they parted,
and Bertram took to drink and couldn’t
paint for sour apples, and a mutual friend re-
introduced him to his wife, just at the moment
when a good old friend, and former protec-
tor, was begging her to return to his arms
in lawful matrimony. Lolette chooses be-
tween the unwavering old sweetheart, whom
she had turned against of yore, and the fickle
husband, who had “chucked” her for a prin-
cess—she talks to them much as Candida
talks to her husband and her other adorer in
Shaw’s comedy—and the broken-down peni-
tent gets re-elected. The Lord only knows
whether they will live happily ever after-
wards. The Bulletin only knows that
Miss Ethel Irving presents a haunting pic-
ture of broken-spirited love for the Ewart
she is trying to forgive.
* * * *
Lolette, as Miss Irving acts her, is a very
real representative of respectably improper
womanhood. In her careless Bohemian
moods, and her subsequent outbursts of
anger, tears and contradictory invective, she
is absolutely convincing to the present

writer. The dramatic conditions are false as
a rule, but the big scenes, when they come
to pass, are imbued with the truth of Miss
Irving’s emotional acting. Stephen Ewart
offers an apologetic suggestion of the hus-
band who is a weak creature of circum-
stances, but he is disposed to be morose
with his wife where the character seems
Only petulant. Miss Violet Ley, as the im-
posing princess, is much too stiff and formal,
yet she shows considerable feeling for the
part in the trying third act. Whitling,
Hobbes and Wilson (as the wordy
and superfluous old prince) deserve
honorable mention: the attempt to create an
atmosphere of Bohemianism in the bustling
first act is nearly successful; and Goatcher’s
scenery is admirable. Melbourne should see
“Dame Nature” for histrionic art’s sake.
Miss Irving’s performance in itself is an
intellectual treat. But, alas! the public in
general asks for entertainment which ap-
proaches more nearly to beer and skittles.

“Romeo and Juliet,” with Melba and the
Cisneros lady, John McCormack, Scandiani,
Edmund Burke and all the minor signors in
the cast, was due at Her Majesty’s (Mel-
bourne), for its first performance, on
Monday this week. Gounod’s opera will
provide another , Melba night on Fri-
day, and on Saturday the vociferous ap-
plause of Marshall-Hall will be missing from
the d.c. at Her Majesty’s. He is to conduct
the orchestra for “Lohengrin,” wherein the
impressive Wayda will appear as Elsa, and
Zeni will be the knight in shining armor, who
comes ’way down the swanny river. Mean-
while, “Samson” retains its rather noisy grip
of popular approval. “Boheme” and “Faust”
are dead sure winners, and “La Tosca” is a
pleasure to hear and see. Puccini’s fine
work happens again to-night. (Thursday).
The part of tortured Mario has passed from
McCormack to Ciccolini. The Italian tenor
is a respectable vocalist in the part, and his
acting strengthens the effect of the thrilling
scene that concludes with Scarpia’s corpse.
At the Princess’s, another knockabout
farce, with musical trimmings, is to displace
“The Swiss Express” on Saturday. The
forthcoming outbreak of the new co. is known
as “His Majesty’s Guests,” and one of the
local additions to the frivolous undertaking
will be the Pony Ballet, of joyful memory.

The Repertory Theatre, having put in its
infancy at the out-of-the-way Turn Verein
building, hopes to enjoy a vigorous youthhood
at St. Pat’s Hall, Bourke-street, opposite
Oxford Chambers, and within lounging dis-
tance of Menzies. The change of site is to
be marked by new Social Distinction. His
Ex. the G.-G. intends to patronise the com-
ing season, not once, or twice, but thrice, if
you please. Himself and lady, with cour-
tiers, will mote to the second performance of
each piece. “Rosmersholm” opens the series
on the 4th of next month, then comes
“Chains,” on the Bth, to be followed by the
Australian Authors’ batch of playlets on the
13th, and it goes without saying, as the G.-G.
remarked to Gregan McMahon, that the local
products must be patronised with due vice-
regal emphasis. “Rosmersholm” is a diffi-
cult nut to crack ; nevertheless, manager Mac.
expects to do it well enough. A handsome
amateur leading lady is studying hard at the
character of Rebecca West, which Duse has
made her own. And there is to be a strong
backbone of professional talent to the male
east. Henry Leigh has a good part; Hard-
ing (one of the Greig brethren) will be in
it, and the indefatigable McMahon takes a
place on the Ibsen bill.

During the Royal
Marriage Ceremony.
At the King’s, “The Prince and the Beg-
gar Maid,” proclaimed by critics to be “the
most subtle and beautiful romantic and
poetic drama produced in recent years,” is
still supplying Romance, in the shape of
Roy Redgrave’s curls, and Poetry, in the form
of Ned Duggan’s legs. The play is really an
international epic. When the inhabitants of
Illyria are starving, Princess Monica an-
nounces that she will do anything to save
them. Prince Hildred does not ask her to emu-
late Mrs. Godiva, but promises to withdraw
his troops if she will wed his twisted but
respectable brother, Michael. Miss Duggan
appeals to Mike’s finer feelings, or something
of the sort, and proposes to be a sister to
him, and pray for him every night. So
Michael surrenders the substance of imme-
diate earthly happiness for the shadow of
possible heavenly bliss. Hildred deceases
violently; the Sylvanian captains and kings
depart from Illyriathe tumult dies inside
the theatre, and the “shouting” commences
outside, preparatory to a wild rush for last
trains.

Kinemacolor was introduced to Mel-
bourne last week, by the Amalgamated Pic-
tures Co., at the Glaciarium. The revela-
tion disposes of the earliest charge that was
brought against this ingenious “natural
color” invention by black-and-white photo-
graphers. The colors were said to “run.”
As a matter of fact, there is no confusion of
tints in the film picture, and though, in some
subjects, fleeting suggestions of red and
green “shutters” (revolving at the rate of
about 2500 per minute), are noticeable on the
screen, the effect of color photos is convincing
enough. The picture produced by Kinema-
color art might be a fine chromo of a masterly
oil painting. In comparison Avith the best
black and white cinematography, there is a
slight loss of sharpness, and a great gain of
realistic impression. And these are only
early specimens of Kinemacolor. anyhow.
The results promise a complete triumph for
the process presently.

THE BEGGAR
MAID , FOR
THE TIME
BEING A
BEGGAR BOY.
The Opera House programme continues as
before, with Bert Levy, and the Kasracs for
its most interesting human items. Chim-
panzee George Ist is also interesting, in his
hairy way, especially when he guides his bike
through a narrow opening between two chair-
backs. As an exponent of the purely animal
vices of civilisation —eating, drinking and
smoking like a clubman- —the chimp, is not
marvellous thus far. George, it seems, is a
mere boy of five, not more than half grown,
and his manners and deportment need more
time for development.

Last week “Rob Roy” gave a Scotchby-
terian appearance to West’s bill, in Mel-
bourne. The film is a generous bit of fiction,
which presents Rob as a cove who performs
even bad deeds from the very best motives.
Other items were a sporting edition of
Pathe’s Gazette, and an extra study of angry
Etna, almost intimate enough to be called
impertinent. West is calling attention to an
“exclusive masterpiece” from the U.S., en-
titled “A Victim of the Mormons.” No
inquiring spinster will willingly miss the
Mormons and their vie.'

Photo-plays at the P’ran Lyric (Vic.), last
week, included “La Tosca,” showing a Floria
as pretty as a picture, and quite as well
painted; “The Kid from Arizona,” a yarn
of tribulation betwen a buckskin beau and
an Injun belle; and an episode in the career
of Comedian Linder, whose capers rival the
frolics of a feather in a gale. “Japanese
Children” displayed the nippers of Nippon
and the manners, customs and duds of the
same.
Only four members of Victoria’s old As-
sembly failed to regain the alleged confidence
of the electors—and that is probably some-
where near a record. No doubt the Govern-
ment’s blunder in ante-dating the dissolu-
tion proclamation a week was responsible
for so many old disasters being left undis-
turbed, but still the event showed a regret-
table deadness about State politics.
How this strike epidemic does spread. All
classes of the community seem to be infected
by it, and the latest threat is that of a Kil-
lara (N.S.W.) J.P. —one F. Dyson. He is
disgusted with Speaker Willis, and his soul
burns so that his reins are consumed within
him. He is holding himself with a firm grip,
but is evidently getting out of hand. So
he writes to the S. M. Herald, asking if
other justices of the peace will join him in
“united action” —the action to take the form
of resigning the commission of the peace.
This is the sympathy-politico strike in its
worst form. To bring Speaker Willis to rea-
son, Mr. Dyson doesn’t propose to do any-
thing to the belligerent Speaker, but to in-
convenience people who want him to witness
a signature; harmless, well-meaning “Lib-
erals” who have never seen Speaker Willis in
their lives, and would not know him if they
saw him; and people who are probably 'just
as indignant as Dyson himself over the woes
of. Wood and the tears of Wade. Next
thing, perhaps, the railway men and domestic
servants will see the force of Dyson’s argu-
ment, and warmly sympathise with him, and
also strike as a protest against Willis. Then
Dyson will have to cook his own breakfast
and walk into town.
Concerning some bloated barrels in a
thirsty land: —
Everything depends, of course, upon what is rec-
koned a suburb ; but, according to the official cata-
loguing, Sydney’s 637,102 people are nearly twice
as thickly packed as Melbourne’s 591,830. (These
are the preliminary census figures.) Sydney has
669 to the 100 acres ; Melbourne only 362. Hobart
(38,055) is actually more crowded than Melbourne;
the small township wherein the Flyspeck on the
bottom of the map plays a farce of maintaining two
Houses of Parliament, has 475 to the 100 acres.
Brisbane (141,027) is the most scattered capital;
it gives 100 acres to every 72 people. Adelaide
(193,294) comes next in the matter of elbow room,
with 100 acres to every 115. In proportion to its
State’s population, Melbourne is the most bloated
city of the Commonwealth; it holds 45 per cent, of
all the people in Victoria, as against 42.7 per cent,
no longer ago than 1907. Outside the metropolitan
area there are only 830 people to every 100 square
miles in Victoria; and even in depopulated Ireland
there are 13,400, or more than 16. times as many.
Taking Australia in a lump, there are 150 to the
100 miles; and it will probably surprise some
people who regard Papua as an uninhabited tropical
wilderness or an equally uninhabited mangrove
swamp, to find that, according to the latest count,
the chance of humping somebody else in
Papua is just two and a half times greater than of
meeting with the same accident in Australia.
AT POVERTY POINT.
In the recent Yic. elections, Sol Bloom, legal bloke
and amateur mummer, opposed Prendergast, the Labor
leader; and when he admitted at a meeting that he
was not a frenzied Rechabite, a ribald youth struck
up-—“ When the Bloom is on the Rye.”
“Busk”: Harry Irving was all right for the people
who had seen his father. There Was always a
spectral pleasure. But, to others, he was, as his
father might have been before development. Irving,
senior, appeared before all kinds of audiences for
eight years, without making any impression.
Ingenious M. P. Adams, the tall young jack-of-all-
crafts in showmanship, has discovered yet another
way of inciting the public to buy his book of
“spieleries.” Turning his business connection with
Path§ FrSres to account, he got himself filmed in the
act of doing the three-card trick, and, at many a
picture show, he is introduced on the screen as
M. P, Adams (his chums call him “Storky”) “aiw
thor of ‘The Rich Uncle from Fiji.’ ” Neat are the
uses of advertisement. And this is one of the purely
Australian notions which seems bound to be adopted
in the older worlds. We may now look out for a
moving picture of Marie Corelli dashing off her next
novel.
“Perplex”: Why is the term “Melba Grand Opera”
applied to performances in which Melba doesn’t ap-
pear? And why are such prices as 7s. 6d. and 15s.
exacted for seats at those non-Melba performances,
seeing that the double Italian Opera C 0. ,! which ap-
peared under Williamson management 10 years ago,
gave stronger shows, at prices ranging from two to
six shillings? The 1901 company consisted of 14
Italians, whose average vocal ability far exceeded
that of the present co„ leaving Melba out of the
comparison. The orchestra, under Hazon, was 41
strong. There were 48 voices in the chorus, and the
first opera of the season, “Aida,” was assisted by a
first-class ballet of 48 legs and as many arms. And
the prices were two, four and six shillings. Com-
pared with the most spectacular productions of that
ill-appreciated company, there is little to make a
to-do about in the “Melba” Grand Operas when
Melba isn’t appearing. Wayda, in “La Tosca,” is a
brilliant prima donna, and Scandiani is a fine actor,
as well as a good singer, and, when McCormack
plays. the tenor part, the public gets more expensive
vocalism than it got from Dani or Larizza (the
best tenor actor this country has ever known) in
1901. But “La Tosca” is not so frequent an event
as “Samson” or “Carmen,” in which the Cisneros
lady is the prima donna, and neither McCormack nor
Scandiani is heard or seen. What is there in the
principals, chorus, orchestra or staging of these popu-
lar performances to make them worth 2J times as
much as the tariff for the season when “Boheme”
was first introduced to Australia? Mrs. De Cisneros
makes no approach to greatness in voice singing or
histrionic art. She is a large lady, with a nice,
mellow contralto, of moderate power, and a simple,
melodramatic method of posing and ogling. Old
playgoers can remember a taller and more beauteous
contralto, with a bigger voice and more delightful
warble, who sang in comic opera with Nellie Stewart
long ago. Marion Burton was her name —a concert
singer of note, who came to Australia .as the wife
of a wealthy globe-trotter, and was secured by Nellie
Stewart and George Musgrove to play the name-nart
m “Paul Jones.” Marion Burton was not Clara
Butt, but she was getting on that way, and no one
who remembers her will now accept De Cisneros
as an astonishing personage among contralto singers.
XT or is the hard-toned tenor (Zeni), who sings in
“Samson” and “Carmen,” a special reason whv they
should rank as “Melba Grand Operas,” and be
charged for accordingly. However, the education
that the non-musical people are receiving, at abnor-
mal prices, will help them to properly appreciate
the next grand opera eo. that comes along with
such entertainments as the 1901 co. offered to half-
emntv houses at 6, 4 and 2.
Hilda Spong, now under engagement to the Com-
bine, has been away from Australia for 16 years, and
middle-aged Melbourne and Sydney will be curious
to see how time has dealt with her since she last
appeared in Bland Holtian melodrama. As a girl
she was a dainty, unaffected actress—a charming
Sweet Lavender with Brough and Boucicault, and a
fairy-like Titania in George Rignold’s “Midsummer
Night’s Dream.” Her two or three years of suffer-
ing heroinics with the Bland Holt co. didn’t improve
her style; all the same, she was a very graceful
young artist when she left this country. In “Every
Woman” —the “modern morality play” which takes
the notion of its title from the ancient monkish
“Everyman”—Miss Hilda will be appealing to the
large unsophisticated public that rushes “The Sign
of the Cross.” The Sign is a “morality” play —of a
sort.
“Tiki,” from Maoriland: The news that the
Maori troupe in London has fallen upon evil days,
and that the syndicate has lost heavily on the ven-
ture, has been received with unmixed satisfaction in
the Ricketty Isles. This archipelago is fond of an
advt. of the right kind, but the Maori display has
filled Maorilanders in London with righteous indig-
nation. Such attractions as “Cannibal Chiefs,”
“Brainpots” and “Earth-eaters” are not calculated
to favorablv impress the intending emigrant with
the desirability of bringing his goods and chattels
out here. In his own land, the Maori is acknow-
ledged as a picturesque adjunct to a landscape; also
he is a good friend and a safe neighbor; but as
part of a second-rate variety show he is something
to be discouraged.
“Penn Nibb”: Good-Lord-deliver-us from the dis-
tortion of monikers which have lived respectable
lives for so long. “Maie” for May is very common,
but “Normaie,” “Elleena” and “Gladeess” (sup-
posedly for Norma, Ellen and Gladys) from a Woods-
Williamson Co.’s Westralian town day-bill are over
the palings, and I want them dragged back to sanity.
Tyrone Power, who used to play Svengali and
other things in Australia, is in a big American suc-
cess, “Thais,” dramatised from Anatole France’s
novel. He is the monk who sets out to rescue the
lady from Sin, and finally gets caught himself —only
by that time she is dying. A New York critic calls
/it “a play, in which Satan and Sanctity travel in
double harness, under the lash of Conscience,” and
says it will be popular with all “who discovered
true works of dramatic art in ‘Ben Hur,’ ‘The
Sign of the Cross,’ and other dramas of that illus-
trious line.” Power has a fine emotional John-
Storm kind of part, and the leading lady (Constance
Collier) “wears as little as possible. No actress
could safely drape herself in less.”
“Snell”: How is this for a bit of descriptive work?
There were three of us in the back bar when the
striking figure entered, and called for stout. He
was wearing masses of astrachan on his coat, although
it was summer. “Doesn’t he look like an actor?”
said I. “Look like an actor!” replied the light of
vaudeville. “Look like an actor! Man alive, you’d
know him for an actor if you met him in a milk
palace!”
According to London Referee, two different play-
wrights are busy making plays out of the Book of
Esther, another is at work on Job, and Marie Corelli
is knocking together a drama out of the New Testa-
ment. Meanwhile, a popular London preacher (An-
glican) is giving a sermon on some play every Sun-
day evening: “What the Public Wants,” “The Ser-
vant in the House,” and so on. His text for Ibsen’s
“Doll’s House” was “And the Lord God said, ‘I will
make an helpmeet for him.’ ”
“Gwy” : Jaded theatre-goers will find some novelty
in the new play of “Everywoman,” which the Com-
bine is to produce shortly. Each character repre-
sents some human trait or quality. Nobody, after
announcing the play, fades away, and Everywoman
enters, accompanied by Youth, Beauty and Modesty.
Then Conscience appears, and presently Truth (a
wrinkled witch, with a scourge of cords in her hand).
Every woman is afraid of her; Youth hides; Beauty
and Modesty slip away, and Flattery disappears.
Truth is beloved by Nobody, the only character left
with her. Then Everywoman feels she has the
makings of a theatrical star, and encounters Bluff
and Stuff, theatrical managers, and Puff, a press
agent. Passion, an actor, sings a love song to her.
Time appears, a call boy, grey and feeble, who gives
the cue for the curtain to fall. She is also visited
by Wealth' and Witless, whom Bluff and Stuff at
first repulse, until they discover that the former has
money, and that the latter belongs to one of the
“first families,” whereupon they grovel and cringe.
In a ballet scene, Pert, Flirt, Smiles, Dimples, Curls,
Curves, Shape, Shy and Giggles titillate the suscep-
tibilities of the baldhead brigade, supported by a
crowd of remittance-men, stage-door Johnnies, gam-
blers, beggars, idlers, etc. Everywoman abandons
herself to the fun, and succeeds in capturing Bluff,
Stuff, Puff, Wealth and Witless.
Alfred R. Moulton, J.C.W.’s conductor of some
years back —he produced “Lelamine,” an opera of
his own, in Australia —is nowadays musical director
of H. W. Savage’s N’York Grand Opera Co. At
latest, he was in Italy, angling for the Puccini
operatic version of “The Girl of the Golden West.”
Herman Merivale, in his reminiscences, speaks of
the mother of Antonia Dolores. He went with
Baron Heath to the Italian opera in Madrid, where
Grisi and Mario were appearing in “The Huguenots.”
“Baron Heath was curious about the page Urbano,
of whom we had heard as a promising and clever
French girl. And when a long-legged and gawky
miss of 16 came on to treat us to her opening song,
in a voice as rich and fresh as a young organ, his
practised taste detected such high promise that he
made me write to Michael Costa, the imperious con-
ductor at Covent Garden, and tell him to send to
Madrid, and look out for Alboni’s successor. Costa’s
answer was to laugh at his friend’s enthusiasm for
wayside genius. But, within a very few seasons,
the pretty maypole made her appearance at the rival
house, and Costa admitted to feeling very sore.” Ad-
mirers of Dolores, the plump, round, short-necked
little platform singer, who stands for a dimpled em-
bodiment of demure femininity in her art and person-
ality, can hardly believe that her mother, Trebell 5 ,
was the ideal operatic “boy” of her time. The pre-
sent writer heard Trebelli as the page in “The Hugue-
nots” when, though nbt a youthful maypole,, she was
still a tall, slim contralto, with long legs and a
manly stride, a pretty-boyish cast of countenance on
a long neck, and hair cut and parted to suit the
character. Save in her perfection of artistrv.
Dolores is the antithesis of her mother, Trebelli-
Bettini, who married Bettini, the violinist leader of
Michael Costa’s orchestra.
“J.F.H.” (London): Clowns ’ have fallen on evil
days. Their occupation is all but gone. There are
few circuses on the roads, and many of the panto-
mimes dispense with the once indispensable harle-
quinade. A once famous member of the profession
has just been found dead in an “indescribably filthy
hovel” in a Westminster lane. Among his few
belongings was found a card, surmounted by the
Royal Arms, entitling him to admission to Windsor
Castle, as one taking part in a command perform-
ance, and instructing him to enter by “King John’s
Door.”
From London: Max Bendix, the new conductor, who
created a sensation on the opening night of “The
Spring Maid,” by standing outside the orchestra and
directing affairs without book or baton, has been
interviewed regarding his outbreak. He says he has
every note of the opera at his finger-tips, and finds
his hands far better for conducting than the “un-
sympathetic and inanimate stick.” Also, he obtains
a more effective control of both the orchestra and the
chorus, by guiding them straight from the brain than
by beating put the time from a book, and he adds
that it is no more to ask the conductor to have the
music in his head than it is to require the actor
to commit his part to memory. Most of the London
papers at first scoffed at the new style, but some
of them have since discovered that, as one puts it.
“it is a real joy to watch him, and to feel the thrill
of his contagions vitality.”
The “great Liberal triumph” in Victoria
begins to show a few spots on the surface.
As soon as the great “Liberal” leader of the
great “Liberal” triumph talked of retiring,
and it was mentioned that he might become
Speaker or Agent-General, Norman Bayles
formed a deputation of great “Liberal” vic-
tors to tell Weary that he wasn’t fitted for
either job. Which recalls that during the
campaign a Weary Minister told Toorak
that Norman Bayles wasn’t a “Liberal” or
anything like one; nevertheless, after the
election, Norman’s return was reckoned
among the things that amounted in the bulk
to fhe great “Liberal” triumph before men-
tioned.

Douglas Mawson, who'is Sydney’s by birth
but Adelaide’s by recent residence, had a big
send-off from the latter city, when making
the beginning of his Antarctic journey last
Saturday. Governor Bosanquet, Mayor
Cohen, University Chancellor Way, and the
heads of the geographical, royal and scientific
societies, all sang his praises at the Town
Hall. Mawson outlined his plans thus: He
leaves Hobart next week, spends several
weeks in fixing a “wireless” plant on Mac-
quarie Island, spends Christmas Day (with
luck) on the continent, and sends the Aurora
back here in March or April. The vessel
goes south again this time next year, and
brings him back (always d.v.) in April,
1913. Meanwhile, he thinks the" world will
hear next March that Scott has reached the
Pole, but that the Germans and the Nor-
wegians down there have failed, and that the
Japs haven’t even scored a try.
Now that the local council has got control
of the Footscray hill, across the Saltwater
River from Flemington (Vic.) racecourse,
and is turning the place into a wooded park,
the crowd that goes there to watch the run
for the Cup, grows larger every year. Not
being a place within the meaning of the Act.
Moses Barwon is not allowed there, and
even the sweep-promoter is chased over the
water. As that hill is spacious enough to
hold more than the big mob over the way,
the thousands who picnicked there in easy
comfort had a pleasanter time than those
who paid to watch the horses. Incidentally,
there is a chance for the holy man to get
busy here. That disaster says it is gamb-
ling that draws people to Flemington, so he
might explain what draws the crowd to
Footscray Hill, where they can view a
notable race but can’t consult Isaac even if
they want to.

“Yorkshireman” howls the howl of scorn
;i 11 the way from Perth :
It has been a source of mild wonder to me, ever
since I came to these parts, that Australians of the
“Society” class should accord the State A.D.C.
the naive regard, not to say reverence, that they do.
There are obvious points in being on a Governor-
General’s staff. The Federal A.D.C. is brought into
association with the bigger things, politically and
otherwise; he is not chronically anchored to the
same old spot; he comes in contact with whatever
interesting people there are to be met, and so on.
As a result, the G.-G.’s staff attracts a useful stamp
of man. But the State servitor’s daily task is as
dreary as his pay, and about as thrilling as the
common round of a lob-worm. Year after year, in
return for a wage that a decent artisan would
spurn, he dodders about in the wake of his em-
ployer or the latter’s wife, clad in an unmeaning top-
hat, or in a still more unmeaning uniform, his job
being to look vacuously on while Blind Asylums,
Dogs’ Homes, etc., are opened, or, while Bands of
Hope and Y.M.C.A. gatherings are harangued. Theo-
retically, he is in attendance on these occasions to
defend his employers, if need be, from the ravening
fury of the mob. As a matter of cold fact (since no
Australian mob ever appears to raven worth -Id. ;
and since, anyhow, it [the mob) is wholly absent
more often than not, owing to blind, bestial indiffer-
ence to these functions) he is, as utterly superfluous
as 10,000 Bashi-Bazouks and a park of artillery
, would be.
s It is apparent that no solvent, healthy and self-
respecting young Briton, with any sort of a career
before him in his own country, would voluntarily
drop into the dead and profitless backwater that
the gentleman-help billet represents. The result is
• that it is filled, in 99 cases out of a hundred, by a
sort of glorified remittance-man.
What are the regiments that supply this be-
nighted country with its State A.D.C.’s? The 10th
Hussars, the 9th Lancers, the “Blues,” or such-like
affluent corps? The R.E., the R.A., or the R.H.A.,
whose brainy and ambitious officers take their sol-
diering seriously? Not on your life. Almost in-
variably the State Governor and his family are
. waited on by cadets of respectable, but more or less
indigent, “upper middle-class” families —the sort of
young men who go into third-rate cavalry regiments,
the Rifle Brigade and the Navy. In the nature of
things, it is the least desirable of their kind that
exile themselves. They are here, usually, for pre-
cisely the same reason the remittance-man is here—
because they have failed, either through incom-
petence, drink, extravagance, lack of energy or what
not, to make good in their own land. And they aim
at identically the same goal as the remittance-man,
namely, a life of complete and glorious leisure at
someone else’s expense. A list of State staff mem-
bers who have married local heiresses in (say) the
last 25 years, would be a lengthy affair. A list of
those who have offered themselves to heiresses, and
been rebuffed, would be simply portentous. On the
other hand, a list of those who have either married
or attempted to marry poor girls, would not trouble
the compositor for two seconds. The significance of
these plain truths is clear.
Australia has quite a reputation, in London club-
dom, as a place where any young waster or incom-
petent may get hold of a moneyed female who will
support him for life, provided he arrives there on a
Governor’s staff. And so the different States fairly
creep with gubernatorial fortune-chasers. Yet Aus-
tralian “Society” never notices anything, seemingly.
What is the trouble with “Society’s” eyesight?

“10-2-4" : Rev. Kay, Moderator of the

address on “Prizefighting,” at Wagga Wagga
on Friday last. It was picturesque, but it
hadn’t much relation to cold, unbellow-
dramatic fact. For example, according to
S. M. Herald (20/ll/’ll), the good man
said:—
The Government should prevent the much-adver-
tised Lang-McVea encounter, “billed” for December
26, 1911, in Sydney. In the case of the Lang-McVea
fight, the color question is raised, a most undesirable
feature.
Many a mere layman, who doesn’t consider
that he knows really enough of the ins and
outs of the boxing game to dogmatise pub-
licly in regard to it, is, nevertheless, ac-
quainted with the fact that there is no
Lang-McVea fight projected on Boxing Day.
or on any other date. No “color question”
will be raised by the contest that is billed
for the 26th December, both competitors
being negoes. Wowserdom and its grotesque
inaccuracies on the subject of the tote, the
racecourse, the ring, etc., always remind me
of the “heraldry expert,” concerning whom
the great Lord Coleridge said to a jury:
“Why. gentlemen, this foolish old person
doesn’t know the rudiments of his own fool-
ish old trade.”

“Mayfair” writes about the closing of a
historic pub : — ,
A Sydney paper mentioned, last week, that Long’s
Hotel, London, had closed for good. The thing is
nothing less than a portent. For about a century
and a quarter the famous Bond street hotel had a
clientele equal to that of any house in Europe. Of
late years, the clientele wasn’t so reputable, pos-
sibly, as in the days of the Regency (say) when few
fashionable visitors to London put up anywhere else.
Still it was there. And then there was the bar. The
bar, with its modest side-entrance off Clifford-street,
was doing a huge trade as recently as half a dozen
years ago, when I was last in London. There one
might meet, any afternoon or morning, such well-
known sporting characters as Bob Sievier, Hon. S. R.
Beresford, Randall, the flat race pro., who used to
be an amateur, “Snip” Ripley, the amateur steeple-
chase rider who so powerfully suggested a pro., and
hundreds more of the same kidney. The “boys” or
“heads” frequented Long’s bar in large herds, de-
spite the earnest efforts of the management to keep
them out. The magnet, as regards most of the
sportsmen and. all the “boys,” was the steady stream
of moneyed youths about town, or “mugs” which
swept through the liquor-dispensary from morn till
bibulous eve.
It requires no undue brain work to diagnose at
least one of the causes of Long’s downfall. The
drinking habit is going out among the wealthier
classes in Britain. A friend of mine, just back
from the Coronation, told me that in his club (the
Army and Navy) the wine bill, per head of the pro-
cession lunehers, was 9d., whereas, at the Queen’s
Jubilee Procession, it was over half a sovereign. In
other words, this year, 90 per cent, of the members
and their guests drank barley-water (the fashionable
beverage of the moment) or some such concoction,
whereas 20 years ago, the same percentage drank in
the neighborhood of a bottle of champagne apiece.
Plainly, nowadays, a West End hotel cannot live
by alcohol alone. It must have a vast Frenchified
restaurant, where one dish is liable to cost a sover-
eign (that is the actual price of a Canard a, la
Presse at the Savoy or Carlton), and where £5 for
decorating a table for four is not considered exces-
sive. Long’s dining-room (the place where Welling-
ton, Byron, Melbourne, Hertford [Thackeray’s Lord
Steyne] Scott and other notabilities of last cen-
tury fed habitually) was a dark, cavern-like little
apartment, opening off a dingy, undersized hall —a
poor background for the clothes of the Smart Set. It
specialised in English cooking; its game pies, grilled
soles and “cold table” were not to be beaten any-
where. But no man stands his best girl an old
English meal these times; and so Long’s is dead.
The town clerk of Mount Morgans (W.A.)
went into the local lire brigade station the
other night, and hanged himself from a con-
venient cross-beam, after writing a letter to
the effect that his official duties had worried
him into the fatal deed. Nobody had any
reason to offer why the town clerk didn’t
drop his worries and run away, instead of
staying on until life wasn’t worth living.
Thus far, the world has never attempted to
explain why the ordinary worried citizen
prefers suicide to a more amusing manner of
escape.

“The Old Soldier”: It is interesting to
note that in the scrap now proceeding in
North Africa, the heavy guns of the Italian
ships quite outranged and outclassed the
Turkish guns, mounted on the Tripolitan
coast works. The same calamity would
occur here if a modern enemy opened fire on
one of our ports. We have been assured,
from London, that the 6in. quick-firer is the
ideal weapon for coast works. Yet it is not
an armor-piercer, and would be about as
useful as a peashooter against even such a
back-number as the Powerful, whose heavy
guns would crush with their fire any number
of the less competent bin. Who gave the
advice, and why, is not known; but it is
rotten. The French and German Govern-
ments arm their harbor defence works with
the most powerful naval guns they have, so
that an enemy’s battleship, if it attacks one
of their land batteries, will always meet
something at least as strong as itself.
WHISKY WINS!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Final Handicap was a fitting termination to
the most successful Spring reunion ever held at
Flemington. When the versatile Mr. Mat Ellis was
seen stalking about the birdcage with a bottle of
whisky, in order to administer Dutch courage to
Kerlie during the saddling-up process, people did
not lose any time over the Maoriland-bred chest-
nut. The dose proved highly efficacious, as on enter-
ing the straight the chestnut son of Melodious soon
assumed command, and, finishing like a Trojan under
the influence of the stimulant, he achieved an easy
victory. —Melbourne Age.
The nag that, coldly sober, speeds along the level
course
Will never catch the beast that wears a breath
that needs a clove;
For Good Luck draws and Whisky shoves the non-
tectotal horse;
He gallops like a whirlwind home before the
watered drove ;
The bright green turf beneath his hoofs like, waves
may rise and fall,
The furlong posts like puppets dance, when show-
men jerk the wire ;
He flies straight on to victory and does not heed at
all,
Because the spirit moves his feet and sets his
brain afire.
But oh ! next day, when with his oats he finds some
laurel-wreath,
He cares not if it be the Gup that he so nobly
won !
He looks his manger in the face, and shuts his yellow
teeth ;
He holds his head with fevered hoofs and loathes
the morning sun.
The hooded, sober “also rans” take walking exercise
Along the quiet country roads and whinny hap-
pily ;
The victor, brooding in his stall, looks round with
bloodshot eyes ;
He's paying for his glory with the dread “re-
covery” !

Men make all sorts of weird things their
mission in life, and this is the story of
Reuben Pinnock, who makes his out of one of
the weirdest of all of them. Reub.’s idea is
that sea-sand should be as free as sea-water;
hence, though Reub. could get the goods at
appointed places for Is. a load, he insists
upon taking them from any other place he fan-
cies, and then he is up against the Law once
more. The Law on the bench asks the Law
on the floor if anything is known of the
accused, and the Law on the floor invariably
says that, except in this matter of sand,
Reuben is an estimable citizen. Then, as at
South Melbourne the other day, the Law on
the bench says 10s. or so; and it has said it
so often that Reuben’s crop of similar trou-
bles now amounts to just upon £4OO. But,
apparently, Reub. is as far from being con-
vinced as ever ; so his holy war will doubt-
less go on.
Still another job has been added to the
N.S.W. policeman’s lot. A senior-constable
was lifted off his beat the other day, and sent
with a motor-car to Broken Hill, to chauffeur
his sub-Excellency Chelmsford back to Syd-
ney. Meantime, “Who killed Trevascus?”
and many other similar riddles, are hung up
indefinitely.
Resenting the order of the chief officer to
start work, the cheap Chinese crew of the
British steamer Strathavon mutinied in Syd-
ney Harbor last week, and drove their bosses
on to the bridge. The first officer’s revolver
kept them at the bottom of 'the ladder, while
one of the other refugees pulled the whistle
string and started to signal the shore with
hand flags. The first person to notice the
trouble was the young daughter of a Sydney
Harbor Trust captain. Most females would
merely have contributed a few screams to
the disorder; but the captain’s girl knew
how to read flags as well as novels, and she
i asted no time in getting out her own flags
and binoculars. The urgent message from
the Strathavon was read and answered; after
which she got hold of the telephone and
called up the Water Police station. A little
later, the police launch streaked across to
the Strathavon and raised the siege. The
Chow bo’sun (somewhat damaged) was ar-
rested on a charge of assaulting the first
officer with his feet, and other Boxers were
taken in custody. The rest of the tale is
police court news. Hereabouts, one recalls
the ugly told. by the officers of the
steamer Kerries, which had to put back hun-
dreds of miles to Mauritius to get rid of its
gang of mutinous and well-armed pigtails.
The yellowjack mav be cheap, but he is un-
pleasant and dangerous in different ways,
and the sea empire that depends on him to
any extent is half-way to the dragons. The
frequency of the Chow in the British mer-
cantile marine is astounding nowadays. A
few weeks back, the outgoing Japanese mail-
boat had to stop at Sydney Heads to tran-
ship from the Island steamer the Chow crew
of the wrecked British vessel St. George!
George V. will yet find some of the gamboge
breed on the Royal yacht. When he does, it
is to be hoped that the usual uprising will
happen in harbor and in full view of someone
who can read signals.
SUBURBAN DRAMA: THE DEATH OF
LADY ISABEL.
(Scene: The bed-chamber at East Lynne.)
LADY ISABEL : “ Farewell, Archibald! Let me
feel your manly arms around me wasted
form once more before I die.”
ARCHIBALD CARLYLE: “Oh, Isabel, leave me not.
I cannot bear to part with you.” (Sotto
Voce: "Hurry up and get it over, or the
pubs will be shut.”)
ONE FOR HER.
“Couldn’t you give me something to stop my
husband talking in his sleep?"
“Urn — yes — s’pose you give him a chance to say
something in the daytime.”
The Rev. Harry Worrall, preaching at the
Congregational Church, I'rahran (Vic.), the
other Sunday, invited two young men who.
had disputed liis dictum to remain behind,
that he might have the pleasure of throwing
them out. Business must be looking up in
the clerical line in Prahran; in most places
the parsons haven’t so much congregation to
spare that they can afford to throw out any
of it. There is one fairly rich church in
Melbourne city, where the minister, if he
threw out two men, would have to preach to
the doormat and a few dear, deaf old ladies.
“Croc. O’Dile”: I
am glad to hear that
the Victorian Educa-
tion Department has
decided to have the
school children taught
the proper way to
speak English. Went
aboard an immigrant
steamer full of Eng-
lish people, the other
day, and I hardly
knew the language,
such was my ignor-
ance. Said one: “Be
thou vrom Zummer-
zet?” Replied the
other: “Bee Oi froam
Soamersit? Bee Oi
from Blaezes ! Oi bee
f roam Hurrafucf!”
“Ai, laad,” said the
first, “be-est, zurely.”
If I hadn’t known they were English, I’d have
tried to sell them a pea-nut stand.
Joyous item from Melbourne Age:
A youth named George Gordon, who made a nui-
sance of himself by pretending to be drunk in Swan-
street, Richmond, on Saturday evening, and was ap-
prehended by Constable Woodbridge, was fined 10s.,
or three days’ gaol, by the local Bench yesterday.
With the genuine paralytic, awash to the
front teeth, and absorbed wholly in an earn-
est struggle to reach home or the nearest
post, one has a certain sympathy. The sing-
ing drunk, the tearful drunk, the comatose
drunk, even the argumentative drunk, all
have mitigating circumstances concealed
about them. But the sham drunk is intoler-
able. He is a. weed of 19 or 20 (the bogus
drunk is never more than 19 or 20, and
mostly he is less) who gyrates at strange
angles, looking for admiration with one eye
and for a possible policeman with the other.
The scale of drunk fees calls for revision.
The plain, harmless beer-ite should begin at
55., and work upwards to £l. Beer with
violence and profanity should range from £1
to, say, five years, according to the amount
of violence ; or it might be £1 up to three
months, and when the case got beyond that
the crime might be called violence with beer.
And bogus beer or sham drunkenness should
be rewarded by exile to the Northern Terri-
tory, and a course of healthy apprenticeship
at the obliteration of ant-hills. It is an un-
wholesome characteristic of the cities, and
the remedy is a sudden return to the simple
life.
“Brass Button”: In
view of the disquieting
fashion in which our
coastal and other steam-
ers have taken to blot-
ting themselves off the
field of human ken, it
seems to me that the
time is ripe for the local
shipping cos. to attach
wreck-locating beacons
to their craft. There are
several of these contrap-
tions on the market. They
take the form of a float
(containing a water-
tight compartment fitted
with a screwed-down lid
for the reception of last
messages) attached to a
thin, strong, steel line
coiled round a reel. The
contrivance stands on the
highest deck-house of the
ship, and releases itself
automatically when the
sinltage happens. The
presence of this reminder
re the perils of the deep,
might depress the pas-
sengers, but that can’t be
helped. If the worst be-
fell, it might give them a
chance to send a last note
home, which is something.
And, most important of
all, it might obviate a
tragedy. It is quite likely
that the Yongala and the
Rosedale are lying now
in places where a vessel,
passing over, could reach
deep enough to foul one
or other of them, and
tear its bottom out. Also,
it is quite possible that
one or both of these ves-
sels died by striking-
some older wreck, which,
for lack of the buoy or
beacon above-described,
was allowed to lurk for-
gotten and unsuspected
till its chance came to bite.
“Brass Button” on a professional mat-
ter
The French barque Quevilly has been chartered for
Australia, and the news should interest those who
have been bewailing the passing of the wind-
jammer. The Quevilly is the first deep-sea sailer of
any size to be fitted with powerful auxiliary oil en-
gines. It is a four-masted, steel-built craft of 322 ft.
length and about 3000 tons register, and the engines
develop 600 horse-power. If it turns out a success,
the sailing clipper may be back with us in herds
before we know where we are.
Auxiliary steam was never satisfactory from the
point of view of the big sailers. To be of any use
a sailer’s auxiliary power has to be always ready
when required, and it mustn’t eat the ship’s head off
when not in use. The engines must not take up
much room, or be heavy, and they must be cheap
to run. The steam engine fell down on all these
points. The oil engine scores on them all. While
the sailer has wind,, it can knock out 10 or 12, or
even 15, knots, and this compares favorably with
plenty of passenger steamers and almost all cargo
tramps. It is the light wind and the flat calm
that eat up time on the windjammer’s voyage.
Food and wages run on all the while, and there is no
certainty of delivery-date of cargo-. These things
have led shippers more and more to pass out the old
canvas carriers. The Quevilly put up 01 knots, under
power alone, over its six-hour trials, and has main-
tained fully this in actual service. With the speed
it would make in favorable winds, this should put it
well on a level with an average cargo carrier.
There are other good points about the oil-engined
sailer. It stands a better chance of clawing off a
lee shore, or out of other unnleasant predicaments,
and this increased safety will result in decreased
insurance rates—a big factor nowadays. The cutting
out of the heavy expense of towing-bills in and out
of port is another important economy. The Quevilly
has already made two or three trips across the Wes-
tern Ocean, and its owners are so well satisfied that
they have placed orders for a new similar ship. La
France, which is to be put on the France-New Cale-
donia run, in the ore trade, and is also to carry a
limited number of passengers. If it. proves the
economical possibilities of sail to still be good
enough to keep the flag flving over the canvas-clad
clippers, the new era will be fairly started, or
rather the old one will be fairly resumed.
The Vic. Board of Health received a
breathless note the other day :
My horse has fallen into a hole. See that it is
removed at once. — Adolphus Psmijthe (or some-
thing similar).
There was no date or address —nothing to
show the location of the hole that Adolphus
wanted the Board to remove ; nothing to sug-
gest whether the horse was out of it, or at
the bottom of it, or suspended half-way; no-
thing to indicate whether Adolphus wanted
the horse removed with the orifice, or whether
he would prefer them shifted separately.
But, in spite of the meagre information, one
can picture Adolphus Psmijthe quite easily.
He is a podgy, puffy person, of right-think-
ing tendencies; he disapproves of “Govern-
ment interference,” and “views with alarm
the existing trend of Socialistic legislation” ;
and, directly anything goes wrong, he rushes
to the State authorities to come and put the
matter right. And when he writes he omits
to give his address, and, later on, he harasses
the papers with letters complaining of de-
partmental delay. Meanwhile, his moke stays
in the hole, and Adolphus becomes more than
ever convinced that he doesn’t know what
the country is coming to.
Having recovered their breath after the
recent collision in the fairway between the
big ferry boat Ivai Kai and the collier Der-
went, the Harbor Trust Commissioners have
made provision for crowding another ferry
service into the already too crowded Sydney
Cove. A re-arrangement of berths at the
Quay is to take place, and a quarter-hour
service is to be run to and from Cremorne
by the Sydney Ferries Ltd., which seems to
be on the most friendly terms with the Har-
bor Trust. Not long ago, the Government
was almost prostrated with “nerves” con-
cerning the then existing dangerous number
of services spreading out of the Cove, and
was threatening the big ferry monopolies
that “something would have to be done”_ to
improve the public’s chance of not being
drowned too frequently. Apparently, how-
ever, the time is not yet ripe, or even .008
per cent. ripe.
YOU DON’T MIND MY ASUING.
THE YOUNGSTER : “Hey, Mister, have. —ham
you got any cigarette cards?"
The cleric is most obnoxious when he goes
about like a raging slot machine devouring
the coppers of defenceless children. _ At the
laying of a Methody chapel foundation-stone
recently, the treasurer proudly recounted
how two little girls had saved all their ha’-
pennies for 18 months, and thereby accumu-
lated between them 1000 small lolly-buying
discs for the building fund. Their small, en-
vious brother had also set his teeth and
avoided lolly shops to the extent of 250 ha’-
pennies—which looks as if he had broken
out occasionally in spite of himself, and
played up a slice of his foundation-stone in
chewing-gum. There is some hope for that
youngster; his sisters will probably grow up
into meek contributors to the steel-hearted
ha’penny traps.
THE LOST LESSON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is observed by Melbourne pietists, obviously
with regret, that the people suffer no marked ill-
effects from the Cup dissipation. “Even the post-
Cup suicide’’ is not a feature of the season, as it
formerly was. This development is due, it would
seem, “to the hardening of the public conscience, and
the individual’s growing incapacity for remorse.”
Come gather round, ye wicked ones,
And list to our reproachful lay.
You’re all the Devil’s younger sons,
And plainly in an awful way.
When you commit a grievous sin,
And back an outside nag and win,
You do not seem to care a pin !
Which shows with terrifying force
You’re quite impervious to remorse.
You go upon a week-long spree
Of horse and opera, play and rout,
You fairly steep in deviltry,
And still your sins don’t find you out.
Clad lavishly from head to feet,
You make quite merry, drink and eat —
In fact, enjoy yourselves a treat —
And come up smiling just the same.
You must be simply lost to shame!
If you will dress and dance and bet
And drink iniquitous champagne,
Oh ! try to cultivate regret;
Let morning bring its proper pain.
Do have “a head” ; look thin and grey ;
Groan deeply, sinner, all next day—
Blow out your brains once in a way
To prove, what holy coves profess,
How dangerous is happiness.

likely that he will resign the Premier-

in February next, a majority of Minis-

Has he glimpsed the furrow where, when the new
hand from the South Coast yokes up his plough
team, he asks the boss: “Shall I take my lunch-
with me?” Has he seen the roads stretching for
endless miles as level as the Suez Canal and
straighter? It is out there that the motor-tractor
is going to get work, hauling the cocky’s wheat and
the squatter’s wool. It’s not the cocky himself who
will own the motor, but an enterprising carrier, who
will scrap his horse-team and go for the faster travel-
ling machine, which he won’t have to chase all over
a paddock at 4 a.m., and which he won’t have to
dose with soda and milk when it gets at the wheat
heap. I give in the fact that the machine can’t
travel on wet roads. Nothing without a toe hold
can. But roads, like throats, - don’t get wet too
frequently in these, regions, and don’t remain long
wet when they get that way.
KNOWN TO THE
POLICE.
INQUISITIVE STRANGER (contem-
plating Mad Mick on the “bust”): “Now, I suppose that's one of your local
identities, eh?"
NATIVE: “Yes, indeed, sir. He's identified about three times a month.”
“M.S.C.”: In answer to “Petto,” I can
say that at least one species of lizard does not re-
turn for a discarded tail, but, instead, sprouts a
new one, which matures within a month. I had one
of the little fellows as a pet for a couple of years,
and one night saw him heave his rudder into the
middle of a heated argument. Although I left his
property handy for him, he refused to accept de-
livery, and very- shortly I saw the new crop coming
on. At first it was merely a tiny point of a pinkish-
grey shade, and almost transparent, but it gradually
became darker, until it was of the same hue as the
rest of the body. Can't say anything about the tail
habits of other lizards,: but more than once I have
seen a hurriedly unhooked queue pounced on by
mobs of black ants, and hauled off to the department
of internal affairs. Also, I have frequently seen
tails lying about in a sun-dried condition, but
whether they are waiting for the owners to return,
or new lizards to grow, I have not been able to dis-
cover.
“Lantana”: “Professor” Morrissey, the
snake-proof man, turned up at Murwillumbah
(N.S.W.), the other day, and delivered a long and
more-or-less eloquent address in the main street.
At the conclusion of his remarks, and prior to giving
a practical demonstration of his methods of breaking
in wild and infuriated crawlers, he sent the hat
round to meet the expenses. It came back without
sufficient to pay even for the hire of the street, and
the Professor opened out. “Look,” he said; “I
wouldn’t show you a snake, and I wouldn’t sell you
a bottle of antidote, not if the whole popula-
tion dropped dead.” Then he grabbed his death
adders by the scruff of the neck and hustled them
off the stone-broke vicinity.
“Vagabond”: Talking about Binghi's
smoke signals. What I don’t understand is how the
dashed things are worked. I never could get to the
system or code used, and never met a white man
who did. “Arcarlo” doesn’t explain how his three
fires are made to carry the news that a white man
is on the track, or that the income-tax collector is
sighted in the offing, but, from other authorities, I
have heard that the Smoky Wireless is manipulated
by a varied number of smoke columns, and a sort
of dot and dash system of cutting off the ascending
clouds. To me, however, that implies a more elab-
orate education than I am willing to believe the
blackfellow capable of. Nevertheless, it is a fact
that the natives of different countries have some
ni3 r sterious means of telegraphing urgent information,
and Binghi’s scheme, if it can be got at, should
make an interesting record.
“Don Guillermo” : I am on one of the big
gest cocoanut plantations in Papua, and have in mj
charge over 100 of the fuzz}', brown native. He is
of various tribes from the villages of the coast and
the interior, and. his chief object in forsaking the
loafing life in the stinking hamlets is to get his
stomach tenanted regularly with the least possible
amount of exertion and the largest possible amount
of food. When he arrives on the plantation, fresh
from his native lair, he is the most intractable and
savagely independent animal that one could im-
agine. To get him to work the white man has to
almost go down on his knees and pray to the grin-
ning savage, for the Government sternly forbids any
more forceful method of persuasion. It happens
sometimes that an overseer, becoming exasperated,
argues his ease with the thick end of a stick. The
missionaries, however, are ever on the spy for in-
stances of such wickedness towards our “dearly
belov-ed black brothers,” and the white culprit falls,
against no end of trouble. I have known an over-
seer to be chased half-way over the plantation by a
horde of shrieking savages, armed with machetos,
and when it became known that he had saved his life
by drawing his revolver on the mob, he was called
to account, severely censured, and warned not to do
it again. The average overseer receives £l2 a
month, with a sago house, and is allowed a cook-
boy. The food bill is never less than £6 a month,
and although we receive medicine free, the planta-
tion does not bear the cost of a doctor’s attendance.
As we are surrounded bv sago swamps, sickness, is
very frequent, and on the plantation I write from
malaria claimed two white victims within a month.
Taking it all round, I reckon £l2 a week would be
a fairer recompense than £l2 a month. ;
“J.G.” : Does any abo. know of any per-
son who has been bitten by a gohanna, or goanna, or
whatever it is? I always thought you couldn’t get
close enough to investigate the jaws of a live speci-
men. Anyhow, all the go’s I have seen have
streaked up the nearest tree like lubricated electricity
before I had time to get within a chain or two of
them. But a water bailiff at Shepparton (Vic.), was
not so lucky. Happening to hurl a stick at one, the
other day, he was suddenly flabbergasted to find the
beast charging down upon him like a maddened
Tory on an Act to suppress extortionate rent. In
his haste to escape, the bailiff fell heavily and par-
tially stunned himself, whereupon the ’go proceeded
to chew him at leisure. Now, I want to know what
to do when a gohanna bites me —and I don’t want
any fool to rise with the suggestion: “Yell like
fury!”
A HURRIED GUESS.
THE BENCH: “How far
away were you? ”
WITNESS: “Ultimo, doss.”
THE BENCH:
“Come now,
how far? Bar
as from here

WITNESS : “ Yes,
boss. ’Bout that
much. 'Bout a
mile.”
“Gravel Path”: When I push into the
controversy tfiat .has been roused by “Vagabond” and
y .., . , _
others, advocating the use of petrol tractors on
farms and country roads,. I must be fair, and admit
t i vj.,-1 c i „„„„ +i t
I know so little of the horse that, if I were asked
where his radiator and gear-box are, I couldn’t tell
without consulting a vet. On the other hand, I have
worked for the past eight years among petrol engines
of all types, and their exhaust is to me sweeter
... , , „
than incense, their cough more melodious than
Melba. I keep a l|-h.p. engine in my bedroom, to
drive a rotary toothbrush. But years of acquaint-
ance has given me a healthy disrespect for their
cussedness and queer ways; so, when I read of the
. •
petrol tractor as “having reached the almost per-
fectly simple stage,” my professional gorge rises,
An ordinary stationary petrol engine is a fairly
tough proposition for an outsider to tackle; but,
when you put it on wheels, the tough proposition
becomes cubed, and it presents a fearful and won-
derful problem to the enthusiast who is familiar with
an intricate bit of machinery like a grindstone or
a tip-dray. Generations of use have given the or-
dinary man an idea, when his moke has its cireulat-
ing pump choked up, when its valves require re-
H ~ a, .
seating, or its muffler unsooting, or when it is miss-
ing in one or more of its four cylinders; but the
man driving a tractor wants to know what’s going
to happen before it actually occurs, for it’s a costly
game repairing a motor after it has run to a stand-
stiH Of course, as “Vagabond” suggests, a man
can be hired, but the cost of a competent man would
knock a lot off the saving effected by the tractor,
unless one did things in a fairly large way, and
could give the machine constant work.

Leo Lear . All tne e\idence T 6 the vag 1 -
aries of cooks did not come out in the recent Arbi-
tration case. Was once'on a Western run where the
cook was continually out of damper, and was finally
roused on by the boss. Next day, all hands went
, . . , .... , , . , ■ tt
mustering, and “the doc.” started to get busy. He
mixed all the flour on the station in the sheep
trough, and, with the aid of a tribe of binghis, built
a fire worthy of the job. When the baking was
concluded, it took: every nigger in the vicinity to
remove it to the hut, where two rows of slabs had
, , , , , ~ ’ ... , ,
to be knocked out to allow of its entrance. That
evening, when the boss returned, cook met him at
the rails, and said: “You wanted damper, did you ?
Well, there’s enough blanlcy damper to last you till
you get another cook.” By the time we had got
the boss round to consciousness with bore water, the
cook was a speck on the plains, bound for the
“Dead End” pub, 35 miles out. This damper was
a plain, bald fact, because I drove the bullock
team that dragged it off the humpy, to fill in a dry
waterhole.
* * * *
“Deeby”: It takes a pretty big bump to
make some men break with Ah Chow. I sub-
mitted a letter for publication in the bread-
wrapper of the town I vegetate in—a town of
mean whites, who patronise almost exclusively the
local Chow shopkeepers. The letter was, I’ll admit,
liardly friendly to John. The boss perused the
epistle attentively, then explained, in an awe-
stricken voice, that' it was impossible—quite im-
possible. “You see,” he explained, “our Chinese
friends might stop advertising.” Nothing much in
that, till you know that the boss is living apart
from his wife owing to the fact that—well, the other
party was a Chow storekeeper He parted with
her; but, with the Chow storekeeper, who supplied
the ads.—never !
How Nelly gave evidence:—
The Wyndham Courthouse was crowded. The
magistrate and C.P.S. took their seats, and the ser-
geant of police called for silehce. All was still,
save for the buzzing of the flies,
The seven “bucks” in the dock ceased grinning at
the town blacks in the body of the courthouse, and
began, to dimly realise that they were the centre of
attraction.
They were duly charged with having,' on or about
the second of July, feloniously killed three head of
bullocks, the property of John Killigrew, of Claypan
Flats. To the question of guilty or not guilty, the
niggers replied, “Yowi.”
The Bench seemed doubtful, but after rescuing
three flies and a red ant from the .inkpot, entered a
plea of not guilty, and proceeded to call evidence.
An aged gin was led to the witness-box, and,
having taken her place, asked the attendant John, in
a whining drawl, for “Lil’ bit ’bacea.” Constable
Bodgers frowned angrily at her, ‘and.Bade her “shut
her gob.” :
The sergeant then proceeded to examine the witr
ness, who was now engaged in lip-talking to th?
prisoners in the dock. She was quite oblivious of
the sergeant, until Constable Bodgers gripped her
by the elbow and jerked her to attention. Thus the
sergeant:—
“What name you?”
“Me Nelly,” replied the lubra.
“You know Claypan station?” _ . j
“Yowi, me bin sit down there long time.”
“You bin see bullock killed there longa bush?”
“Yowi, me bin see him tumble down.”
The sergeant in a confidential sort of way then
said: “You know which .feller bin kill ’em?”
The gin (eagerly) : “Yowi.”
“Well, Nelly, you show ’em me that feller.”
Nelly, as a sense of her importance began to
dawn on her, swept a bleary eye right round the
courthouse, and finally fixing- it on the C.P.S.,
pointed an accusing finger at him, and exclaimed:
“That pfeller bin kill ’im.”
For a moment the sergeant was paralysed. To
think that after all his careful coaching, his chief
witness should turn dog on him. Then, collecting
his scattered senses, he yelled at the witness: “No,
no, Nelly; that one Mr. Guv’ment.”
“O Crise!” said sweet . Nell. ,
“You have ’nother try ; might you’ll find him this
time,” said the sergeant.
With great care and deliberation Nelly scanned
the faces of everybody in the Court, barring the
prisoners. After an impressive pause she pointed
to the R.M. on the Bench, and said shyly: “That
pfeller bin spear ’im.”
A roar of laughter from the back of the court
was sternly checked by the sergeant. The Bench,
frothing with heat and rage, informed him that he
was an ass, and that the case was dismissed, and
that in future he (the sergeant) had better take more
care in preparing' his evidence, and not waste the
valuable time of the Court. Then, aside to the
C.P.S., “Comeanaveapeg.”
“Genung” : Curious how some words get
the dirty- left and are counted out. The latest to
receive the Old Age Pension is “larrikin.” Micko,
from Collingwood, may be a “tug” or a “crook” or
a “rough-up” or a “hotty,” but if you called him a
larrikin he’d look at you and wonder whether you
meant, is a compliment or an insult. He’d pro-
bably “pass you one,” anyway, on the off-chance
that it wasn’t a compliment.
* * * •
“Noola” : I know one man, anyhow, who
won’t agree with “Mallacoota” regarding the reten-
tion of the aboriginal nomenclature. He lived in
the agricultural centre of Coonawarra, which took
its name' from the fact that its high land was much
used by cattle as a camping place. The hind part
of the word means cattle, and the front represents
the proof of their having been on the spot. My
friend, however, who owned the local butter fac-
tory, was ignorant of this fact, or he would never
have used the imprint “Coona” on his pound pats
of cow grease!
ONE MORE EGG DAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m living at a boarding-house
Where, in the night, the hashes grow
Like moss upon the cold, grey stone,
And in the morning!s eerie glow
Are softly gathered with a hoe.
When hash is off they give us eggs.
We gaze on them and think of home ;
But no man dares to break the shell —
Those eggs were gathered from the loam
With other Lays of Ancient Rome.
To hospitals they’re giving eggs ;
Each goodly deed the papers tell.
We boarders are collecting ours—
We deem it time that there befell
An Egg Day for the morgue as well!

“Eddyson” : From the summit of Hungry
Range, in the little-known coal country of Gipps-
land, looking east across a grey ocean of tree-tops,
we, of the Ilazlewood prospecting party, often saw
a spiral of smoke rising out of the vastness in one
particular spot far below. It was an understood
thing that, one of these Sundays, when we were ener-
getic enough to tear ourselves from our bunks after
lunch, we would drop in on our nearest neighbor,
and ask ourselves to afternoon tea. Eventually, four
of us departed on the great adventure, and two hours’
solid walking brought us to a small clearing, with a
sagging bark humpy in the north-west corner, and a
small, shaggy man, in two-thirds of a pair of white
mole pants and half a blue shirt, sitting on a log in
the foreground, in friendly communication with a
large, palpitant gohanna. The go. distributed him-
self partly over the log and largely over the man,
and his execrable head was supported on the man’s
left arm. The man talked to the ’hanna, and now
and again shot a particle of baked mutton into the
’hanna’s grin. So absorbed was the settler in his
single-handed conversazione that he did not notice his
attentive audience. His remarks to the ’hanna were
in the nature of the foolish observations usually
thrown at a cockatoo, fatuously reiterated. As we
watched the small man’s voice grew more shrill; he
squealed the words at his tailed audience: “Pretty
cocky! Pretty cocky! Cocky wants some sugar.
Oh, you , you , you !” Then, losing
all patience, he batted the reptile on the jowl.
“Ar-r-r, get out, yeh lazy cow!” said he. At that
moment he caught my eye. He betrayed no surprise.
“I don’t believe I’ll ever teach the beast to talk,” he
said.

“Houp-La”: About two years ago I at-
tended the crowded first night of a large circus. A
parade was the first item on the bill; and, though
the outer ring was partly blocked with extra chairs,
the management went ahead with it. The camels,
horses, cattle, and other comparatively narrow
animals got through without a great deal of trouble ;
but when the elephants stepped along, the people in
front were gently brushed off their chairs and forced
to fall back. The lumpish brutes flapped their ears,
squealed, and gesticulated impatiently with their
trunks, but fortunately refrained from stamping,
charging, or threshing the buzzing crowd with the
old forward suction-hose and grab-all. I was glad
when that parade ended. Personally, I have less
confidence in the elephant than Bruce Smith has in
Socialism. He makes too many bad breaks. The
recent gruesome accident at Wangaratta (Vic.), when
a circus groom was charged by Wirths’ bull-elephant
Jumbo, and had the flesh torn from his chest and
neck, has made me more suspicious than ever, and I
intend taking along a sledgehammer and a few
spikes next time I visit a menagerie. (I notice
that the murderous brute was only prevented from
completing the tragedy by a charge of circus hands
armed with these implements.)
A CRY OF BITTERNESS.
"You-you COW! ”
“Lantana”: Another of the sun-burnt
women of the Outback who can do dad’s share of
the graft when necessary was given the good word
at a recent meeting of the Jondaryan (Q.) shire
council. Her husband had been a road contractor
for the council, and having fallen ill, the wife took
the job in hand, and saw it through. “And it was
a well-done job, too,” said the inspector who re-
ported the matter.

“Inchiquin” : “Leo Lear’s” homestead (B.
26/10/’ll) isn’t so old. On Ayliffe and Mackay’s
property, at Cygnet River, Kangaroo Island (S.A.),
there is a slab hut, in first-class condition, and used
as a chaff and grain shed. It is made of red gum
slabs, each slab set in the ground. The oldest in-
habitant (he’s about 114, and the youngest is nearly
91) puts the building down at 84. It certainly was
one of the first, if not the first, hut built on the
island, so it is probably as ancient as it is said to
be. Yet every slab is in perfect order, and the only
repair so far called for has been a new roof.
MOUND-BUILTING EXTRAORDINARY.
MULGA BILL (doing Egypt): “ Gripes, mother, the brush turkeys work overtime in
these ’ere parts orright! ”
“Gent One.” for the defence: —
“Mallarapoonie,” with his stinking fish support
to the predictions of trouble in land settlement in
the West, ought to procure work, preferably to the
east’ard of Northam, where he might be of some use
in harvesting the crops that are gladdening the
hearts of many cookies, who are not situated within
“Mallarapoonie’s” Westralian substitute for Goyder’s
line of rainfall. As a matter of fact, the tract of
country outside the belt, described by him as the
Leeuwin Peninsula, has, during the past 10 years,
produced an average wheat return far exceeding that
of the tract inside the belt. In regard to “M.’s”
statement, that the folk who have taken up wheat
land as far east as Merredin, and almost to Southern
Cross, are simply squatting on a volcano, I am im-
pelled to say that if he will get an expert to give
him a report on the territory which is bounded on
the north by Geraldton, on the east by Merredin, and
on the south by (say) K a tanning, I will wager the
belltopper I use when ploughing to his smallest
dead fish, that he will be proved to be the poorest
judge of wheat lands outside the place where wild
straightjackets bloom. Meckering to Tammin,
Tammin to Cow-Cowing, and south to the Great
Southern line embraces ideal unmixed farming
country. Ever since civilisation was extended beyond
the Darling ranges, sheep- and horse- and cattle-
rearing has been carried on in the country east and
north of Northam; but the lack of railways has
prevented the goods from reaching the markets, thus
rendering the industries unprofitable. Many years
ago, I saw at Southern Cross, one of the finest crops
of barley I have seen anywhere ; and last year, whilst
engaged plucking a few finches at the historic min-
ing camp of Bullfinch, I saw magnificent crops being
cut for hay around Southern Cross. In addition,
I wandered over much country in search of the gold
that glitters when you find it, and came away con-
vinced that many shindykyts would, indeed, return
a dividend to investors if those magnificent acres of
saltbush and other edible shrubs were carrying the
sheep and cattle they are quite capable of doing.
I haven’t got the official rainfall figures up my
sleeve at the minute, but I know sufficient about
them to assure the Supreme Abo. Court that if they
are sent for and produced, my learned friend will
be outed on the spot.
* * * *
“Condamine” : I ran across Foster Fraser’s
cobber a couple of months ago—l mean the one who
posed for the picture of the “Degenerate Australian.”
I was driving from Germanton to Cookardinia
(N.S.W.), and, wishing to find out something about
the country beyond, I gave a bagman a lift, thinking
that, if anyone was an authority on roads in gen-
eral, it would be Matilda’s mate. Not a little bit!
Deponent’s beat was the small region having for its
four corners Germanton, Cookardinia, Ilenty and
Culcairn. Any by-road or camping spot in this area
he could give full details about; outside that, he
knew nothing modern. “Don’t you ever work?” I
asked. “Oh, yes,” he said. “I only finished a job
of grape-picking nine months ago down near Albury.
I was three quid strong when we cut out.” “Going
to tackle another job ever?” “Lord lum-me, yes.
I’m going back to the same cop next year.”
“X.P.D.”: Lucerne is certainly the star
item when it comes to deep rooting. Some time
back, near the Seventeen Mile Rocks (Q.), a land-
slip unearthed the tentacles of the vegetable octopus
40ft. below the surface.
“Romun” : Re the niggers’ financial abili-
ties or otherwise. A black deputation waited upon
me once, and desired that I should fix up a little
matter of business. Tommy (a stout nigger) stated
his case: “One time I bin buy ’em yarraman alonga
Winton, gibbet gin arid two pfella quid alongit
this pfella (Combo). Him wantem two more
pfella quid some time. I say, I gibbit two quid
later on. He say yes. I takern yarraman, leavem
gin. Then me sellum yarraman alonga Billy, and he
gibbit me cheque £4 and blanket, and some time
he gibbit ’nuther three quid.” Up to this it appears
that Tommy had done well unless the gin in the
first deal was considered a liability instead of an
asset. Now Billy had his say: “Me gibben Tommy
four quid, blanket, and owe it three quid.
Then me sellem yarraman to white pfella
alonga Windorah for six quid. He gibbit
cheque alonga Alec (another nigger). Alec
been spendem cheque, and. no bin gibbit this
cheque some time; me wantem now. He say go
alonga boss. Me askem you gibbit cheque.” Alex,
had no money in the books, so that debt had to stand
over as far as I was concerned. Alex, then offered
“one pfella gin alonga -camp” to the outraged Billy,
but Billy wasn’t on, as he had one gin, and another
was superfluous. Alex, then entered into a contract to
build “humpy alonga camp—big pfella humpy” for
Billy. Then Billy, to square Tommy, had to hand
over half the humpy. That left Tommy still in debt
to the first nigger (Combo) to the extent of £2,
and also minus his gin. The £2 had to be left in
abeyance. Upon their return to their camps, they
found that the black lady wouldn’t camp with
Combo. “No good that one—me no likem, me
campem alonga new humpy with Tommy.” The
prospective new residence had caught the lady’s eye,
and she desired to return to her old flame Tommy.
The question then was, What price to put on the
gin? She belonged to Combo, but Tommy was per-
fectly willing to buy her back (so she was an asset
after all) if they could make a bargain.. They then
decided to put the matter to me again. I valued
the gin at 305., and they then wanted to know how
they all stood in each other’s books. After an hour
and a-half spent in explaining the situation and get-
ting no further ahead, I fled in despair.
* * * *
“Ding”: I don’t want to say any more
than this, that with an axe made of malee I’ll
guarantee to chop into toothpicks any wood so far
alleged to be hard in this page. That ought to con-
clude the argument. On the other hand, the softest
wood in Australia is the Christmas-tree of Westralia.
Bill Lang could punch a hole through it!
“Pick” : During the breeding season, wild
ducks, if unmolested, provide the surest indications
of coming weather conditions. Ordinarily, Mrs.
Drake is satisfied with the cares of one family
per season, but if she is found bustling through with
a second clutch, a wet season may be expected
with certainty, and her appearance with a third
brood is an early warning to caulk up the ark. If,
however, the duck shows an inclination to help on
the declining birthrate, and refrains from hatching
for a season, a drought time invariably follows.
Unfortunately, the average bushman destroys this op-
portunity for reading nature's calendar, by either
robbing the eggs, or shooting the eggist.
“Microba”: Did you ever hear of a man
losing his money ? I never have, although I know
many who “do their dough,” “blue their sugar,
“lose their wire,” “drop their wad,” “leave their
loot,” “miss their boodle,” or “spill their splosh.”
On the other hand, 1 am acquainted with a few who
have “heaps of brass,” “plenty of tin,” “loads of
jink,” “piles of gilt,” “whips of boodle,” “stacks of
the needful,” and “lashings of stuff.” For myself,
I’m broke, stiff and absolutely stony.
“Koreki”: I’m satisfied that there was
an Irishman taking a hand when the Papuan lan-
guage was being forged. For instance, in the Yar-
arari district, on the head waters' of the Kemp-
Welch, there is an edible nut known to the natives
as okeli, which is I-talian for O’Kelly; omalli is a
stone, and was originally spelt O’Malley; omani is
a tree resembling the Australian stringy-bark, but in
Hibernian it appears as O’Mahony. Those, of course,
may be coincidences, but the fair-skinned, red-
headed natives which are met, here and there, are
O Patrick on the face of them.
The Weird Illogicality of the “Anti-
Gambling” Cleric.
“M. Safran”—-his discourse
It is easy to understand most of the attitudes
adopted in the Tote v. Bookmaker controversy, now
raging in N. S. Wales and Victoria. The bookmaker
naturally opposes the tote, because, while it may not
wipe out his means of livelihood altogether, it will
certainly make serious inroads on it. The “big
backer,” who is sometimes an owner and sometimes
not, the man who constantly stands to win hundreds,
and occasionally thousands, over a race, argues
against the tote in the same spirit that Jones would
argue against a proposal to replace auction bridge or
poker at his club, with patience or draughts. The
contrary attitude of the reformer who wants the tote
instituted is equally understandable. He isn’t such
an ass as to claim that the tote will reduce gamb-
ling. But he does say, without fear of contradiction,
that it will make betting a more savory and com-
fortable and civilised affair; that it will tend to
give the public immunity from “welshing,” and a
fairer run for its money; that it will diminish the
number of extravagantly big bets and of small
“booked bets”—the tempting form of gambling that
has driven: so many sanguine “mugs” to cash short-
age and gaol—and, best of all, that it will divert an
immense sum, annually, from the bank accounts of
the Ring into those of the State.
These are aspirations that folks of the most di-
verse views can grasp. But what earthly sense or
logic is there in the attitude of the allegedly “anti-
gambling” parson on this question? Lately, one of
them, a person by the name of Binns, wrote to the
N.S.W. papers barracking for the existing order of
things, in characteristically melodramatic phrase-
ology, as follows: —
We will have none of gambling. We are op-
posed to it root, branch and fruit. We want it to
stand out in all its heartlessness, dishonesty and
ugliness. I think it is Pope who says, ‘Vice is a
monster of such frightful mien as to be hated, needs
but to be seen, but seen too oft, familiar with its
face, we first endure, then pity, then embrace.’
We want this monster of gambling to stand out in
all its ‘frightful mien.’ We object to its being estab-
lished on the firm foundation of legality, and but-
tressed up on all sides by the vested interests
which will surely grow up around it if this Bill is
passed, and we most strongly object to this deadly
and insidious evil having thrown around it the fair
mantle of Charity.”
A lot of energy is being expended by the more spec-
tacular of our Wowser clerics along the above lines.
They profess to be the deadly foes of gambling. Their
painfully unconvincing argument is that if the
“frightful mien” of the gambling monster is only ex-
hibited long enough at Randwick, Flemington and
elsewhere, the populace will recede from it in loath-
ing. However, the populace has been gazing at this
horror for decades now, and, every year, more and
more people roll up to the race-courses and give it
the warmest greeting. It is as clear as daylight that
the only honest cure for racecourse gambling is the
abolition of racing. Yet not one of our alleged
“anti-gamblers” has the nerve to start an anti-race-
course campaign. Good Mr. McGowen, the Sabbath-
school superintendent, has not mentioned the subject
during his term of office, nor did upright Mr. Wade,
whose anti-gambling measures,, by the way, have
notoriously done about as much real damage to
gambling in N.S.W. as they have to sly-grog selling
in Maine (U.S.).
So long as horse-racing exists, and altogether irres-
pective of whether racecourse betting is carried on
by means of bookies or totes, a heap of things,
highly reprehensible from the untamed moralist’s
standpoint, must happen. Clearly, if the “anti-gam-
bling” parsons were sincere in their loathing of Vice,
and if their churches were not strongly influenced by
the vested interests represented by the big race-
courses, they would advance on this, the real evil,
without delay or remorse. They can hardly argue
that the task is too big for human strength. Sir
George Clarke, ex-Governor of Victoria, has grappled
with the problem in so sport-loving a place as Bom-
bay, albeit in a tentative sort of fashion; and New
York State has practically gone the whole hog. In
any case, the same crowd that is now fighting for the
bookmakers, on the plea that they are morally bound
to oppose the tote, wastes hours every week on an
immeasurably vaster and more futile campaign than
any that could be launched against racing—namely, a
campaign against an alleged Devil. It cannot be
argued that from the standpoint of the Righteous,
the abolition of racing is not worth while. In addition
to being the Commonwealth’s biggest gambling hells,
Caulfield, Randwick, Flemington, etc., are also the
nearest approaches we have to London’s Empire and
Alhambra lounges. On race-days, they are, among
other things, the frankest of assignation-places. From
every point of view, they call for the assaults of the
godly. But the godly lie low. Indeed, the godly go
further, and urge that these sinful places should be
left just as they are. *
By all the laws of logic and morality, there should
be three distinct parties to this Tote v. Book dis-
pute: (1) The pro-books; (2) the pro-totes; (3) the
anti-gamblers. Instead, there is one party (the pro-
tote party) calling for the most decent and innocu-
ous form of betting that has been hitherto devised,
and another party made up of bookies and Wowser
parsons, yelling for the maintenance of the status
quo. The Wowser’s position in this matter always
suggests to me an aged Archdeacon frantically plead-
ing for free love and unlimited beer.

A LOST OPPORTUNITY.
Mr. St. Leger (Q.) at great length criticised the
Government’s mode of doing business. He ques-
tioned the principle of taking expenditure out of
revenue instead of borrowing. Mr. Sayers (Q.) bore
out the arguments of Mr. St. Ledger. —Daily paper.
LIBERAL PERSON : “ What a silly business, buy-
ing things like that out of your income,
and your old uncle so handy , too. Besides,
see what a spree you could have had.”
The S. Aus. Assembly has lost its “re-
cord” Speaker, Jenkin Coles, who had sat
in the chair for 21 years without missing one
sitting or being once late. Twelve months
ago he fell ill; and there is so little hope of
the cloud lifting that, last week, his eldest
son, on behalf of the family, let the Govern-
ment know that further indulgence could not
reasonably be asked for. So Henry Jackson,
his deputy, has been elected to the chair—
and poor Coles is beyond being even con-
sulted about it.
With Jenkin Coles's retirement into the
black shadow, goes out of public life the last
of S. Australia’s famous “six fathom” Minis-
try of the mid ’Bo’s. John Colton was Pre-
mier, Kingston Attorney-General, Ben Roun-
sevell Treasurer, Coles Minister for Lands,
Playford for Works, and Chaffey Baker for
Justice and Education. They were all big,
burly, six-footers. Only Playford and Coles
are alive, and Playford is alive because he
quitted politics, stuck to his market garden,
and gives the world cherries instead of heavy
speeches. Colton, Kingston and Baker broke
down early : Coles follows in the same way,
and, altogether, there isn’t much comfort for
the big, beefy six-footer in the whole record.

Died, at Smythesdale (Vic.), John Lynch,
C.E., of the Vic Board of Country Fire Bri-
gades, one of the last four of an extraor-
dinary family of 10. With John, the en-
gineer, gone, the only remnants are Dr.
Arthur Lynch, of the House of Commons
(pardoned after being sentenced to death
for his share in the Boer worry), and Drs.
Peter and Maurice, of Melbourne.
Samuel Manger, now in England, has
been lecturing on this country to Hodge and
Podge. Accompanied by lantern slides and
the approval of High Provisioner Reid, he
has sauntered about the counties and left a
lot of information for Podge and Hodge to
- take home to the missus. Mostly he has
yarned about the Northern Territory, hut he
has also dropped some facts about the Com-
monwealth generally that should enlighten
J. Bull on the subject of our empty spaces.
Mauger has often been less usefully em-
ployed.
As “Oxon ” views it: —
A. J. Balfour displayed tactical genius in resign-
ing the leadership of the Tory party when he did.
It brought him all the glory and pathos that are the
adjuncts of death, without the unpleasantness of
dying. Every newspaper in the kingdom seems to
have joined, regardless of party, creed or nationality,
in fulsomely adulating him as a man and a states-
man. That would be gratifying even to one who
had lived less in the public eye, and depended less
on the breath of popular favor than Balfour has.
No doubt he would have been pushed off his throne
by main force had he waited much longer. By re-
tiring gracefully, before the push came, he saved his
face, and had the natural, human gratification of
leaving his disloyal colleagues in an awkward posi-
tion. The men of force and character in tlie Tory
party have no brains, and the men of brains are lack-
ing in seriousness or resolution or personality, or
all three. While they proceed from blunder to blun-
der, Balfour will lounge at ease, on the verandah of
his golf club, so to speak, and hear England explain
how much better the Master would have managed
things. The Tories look like suffering a long spell
in opposition. Their leading men are a poor lot' —
painfully dull where they aren’t hopelessly irrespon-
sible —while the ranks of their opponents are fairly
teeming with strong, picturesque figures. The coun-
try has need of a heap more of that industrial legis-
lation which the Australian “Liberal” papers used
to call “Socialistic” and “wildly experimental”—
wants that no Tory administration can supply. And
by the time these matters are disposed of, the Liber-
als will probably be ripe for conversion to Tariff
Reform—about the only decent weapon in the armory
of Toryism. Altogether, Balfour has good cause to
be grateful to the B.M.G. insurrectionists. They
have been the indirect means of enabling him to
enjoy two priceless things—immortality, in his own
life time and an unharassed old age.
In tlie interests of a posterity,
which it isn’t half so anxious about
when it is a question of paying off
the I O U, Melbourne City Coun-
cil is having reproductions taken
of the portraits of its 42 mayors
and, six gaud mayors. These por-
traits are, somehow, valued at
£2OOO, and the council fears that,
if they should be burned, or other-
wise destroyed, posterity might not
be able to bear up. Mostly, the
portraits are those of stodgy non-
entities of small intelligence but
large presence, though there are
one or two who may be remem-
bered by-and-bye. Jacky Tommy
Smith is one. He filled the office
seven times, built the old Queen’s
Theatre, and used to spend his
lunch hour, on hot days, sitting on
the Town Hall steps, in his shirt
sleeves, smoking a disgracefully
strong pipe. Another is the per-
ennial J. S. Butters, who, in the
boom days, raised £lO,OOO in a
week tor the Melbourne Hospital.
Portraits of Govs. Latrobe and
Hopetoun, and of Lord Melbourne
are among the batch. Also, there
is one of John Aitkin, though no-
body seems to know who he was, or
how he comes there. Apparently,
he happened along one day,
and, finding his proper atmosphere at
last, stuck his face on the wall, and the
councillors, recognising a kindred spirit, let
it stay there.
William Baillee, the ancient Victorian
contractor, just dead in Adelaide, used to
describe with great satisfaction how Peter
Lalor, after Eureka, got away to the Baillee
Brothers’ yard, in Flinders-street, Melbourne,
and was there hidden till he recovered from
his wound, the recovery being aided by a
doctor who came in every morning and even-
ing disguised as a clergyman.
By “Henri Singemoine” :
Wilfrid Blunt, whom the -Parliamentary Secretary
to the War Office is trying, in the - words of Reuter,
“to remove from the Commission of the Peace for
calling certain. British troops ‘murderers’ and
‘scum,’ is a contradictory sort of customer. (A
cable next morning mentioned that Blunt had scorn-
fully denied that he was on the Commission of the
Peace—but that by the way.) He is a Catholic
Tory, the possessor of a beautiful country
seat and a big income, the son-in-law of an.Eari,
a member of the Travellers’ and other unim-
peachable Clubs, and a person of stainless character.
On the other hand, he is what a British Unionist
would call a Fenian (he has “done time” in Galway
and Kilmainham Gaols in the cause of Home Rule) ;
and in Egypt, which he knows as well as any living
European, he is an open opponent of the British oc-
cupation. He owns an oasis outside Cairo. On it he
has built a sort of combined Moorish palace and
modern racing stable. Here he breeds his famous
Arab thoroughbreds. Blunt’s annual sale of Arabs at
Crabbet Park (his seat in Sussex) was one of the
features of the London season till a few years back.
He killed the function by his habit of putting im-
mense reserves on all the animals that were worth
buying. When not agitating against something, or
practising his religion, or superintending his stud,
he spends most of his time in writing. Some of
his poetry has won high praise from the big reviews.
His prose is mainly characterised by acid plainness
of speech, and blank indifference to the feelings of
constituted authority. In short, he is the sort of
person whom Bob Sievier, the newly-adopted Union-
ist candidate for Hoxton would term “a menace to
Society.”
SKY PILOTAGE.
PREACHER : “Ah, my friend, try and lead the
higher life.”
RETIRED AERONAUT: “I did, but it’s too
risky.”
Walter Russell Hall’s N. S. Wales estate
has been valued for probate at £2,311,000,
and there is a big lump of Queensland and
Victorian property to be added to that, so
The Bulletin’s estimate of 3J millions will
probably be reached. The Mt. Morgana ire
made his will 16 years ago, and merely added
an unimportant codicil or two afterwards.
He scatters a few hundreds of thousands in
legacies, and his widow gets the rest. There
are no children. But as the estate has grown
so much richer since the will was made, the
widow isn’t paying much regard to the fig-
ures mentioned in the document, and charit-
able institutions in N.-S. Wales and Queens-
land, which were to get £50,000, will proba-
bly come in for a great deal more.
THE MORNING AFTER.
SHE (taking her revenge): “Serves you right.
You should never lake anything that dis-
agrees with you.”
HE : “Well, I took you.”
According to Lionel Terry:—
The psalm-singers of Maoriland might make
themselves more intelligible to the Almighty if they
prayed for the coming of a good swineherd instead
of a good shepherd.
Nevertheless, Terry is still held as a lunatic
in Sunnyside Asylum.
“Chasuble”: Monsignor Capel’s death is
reported from’ California. He figured in Dis-
raeli’s “Lothair,” where Manning was Car-
dinal Grandison. Capel’s Disraelian name
was Catesby, but on one page it was mis-
printed, either by accident or design, as
Capel. The Monsignor title has been given
to several Australian ecclesiastics, but most
of them have kept it in the background
as i with Deans O’Hea and Fitzpatrick, of
Melbourne. The idea seems to be that,
somehow or other, the monsignor is expected
to be a Worldly Wiseman. Capel certainly
was an amiable intriguer, and his over-play-
ing of that part may explain why he never
got forward into a bishopric.
No staff-man on the Adelaide
papers has become a fhilitoriafte;
but, if they don’t load theft meii
with riches, 'they at last don't mind
giving them limelight. Thus, maiii-
ly through the Register, the papei-
he worked on for years, Dave Gor-
don’s name became a household
word in S. Aus.; and that helped
him into E. L. Batchelor’s seat in
the House of Ileps. Gordon was
for _lO years chief of the Regis-
ter’s Parliamentary staff, and, in
recess, usually wandered off into
the country to write up special ar-
ticles. Once he rode' across the
continent, but mostly he gave the
Murray and the Murray country a
whoop—and the Register pasted
an advt. for him on his work. Like
Sowden, the editor, lie came from
up-country in S. Aus. Sowden
began his working life as a compos-
itor in a backblocks printing office ;
Gordon’s start was on a farm.
Died, last week, Charles Cowper,
tlie son of “Slippery Charley,” who
was the head of five eaiiy-day Min-
istries in N. S. .Wales. When
“Slippery Charley” formed his
third Cabinet, 51 years ago, young
Charley had just got into Parlia-
ment, and the old man gave the
youngster a place in the Ministry,
without portfolio. But young
Charley wanted a steady job—of.
anyhow, a steady salary—and his
political, pals found just: the tiling
that suited him, and made him
Sheriff —a billet that gave him
fair pay and the chance to weal-
frills and sit in the limelight. The
time came, however, when business consid-
erations were applied even to the sheriff's
job, and them cheerful “Charley” whs fiioVed
out of liis pleasant On Cockatoo
Island, and went to live in the country;
Maorilftnd's Bank of New Zealand
crawled otit fto ill among the overdrafts tlie
othei- day-, to intention that it was just 50
years old. Of the original staff, only two
remain alive-—Kissling, the teller, now a
merchant; and Basley, the junior clerk, now
a lawyer and patents agent.
If James McGowen can last long enough
in his present job, he is to be given the chance
to formally open the new tail why btidgte

“Konini”: Gone, in the

ter of the great chief. Hepi

about 2000 of Meta Bull's

ner of Slieol that the sum-
mons of the British to sur
render was answered by the
historic cry now used by
hoofballers and other mud-
died oafs: ‘We will fight on
for ever, and ever and ever.’’
Tukorehu died that day,
but the traditions of his
house lost nothing in their
descent to his blue-hlooded
daughter. She was a direct
descendant of some very dis-
tinguished cannibals who
left the picked bones of their
enemies lying along the
track of time right back to
tne day when Ngatoroirangl.
the chief and high priest, of
the Arawa canoe, landed six
centuries ago from the le-
gendary land of Ilawaiiki.
From London: —
If Cardinal Moran were still around he would
reach for his stoutest shillelagh, and bring it down
on the head of the Rev. Norbert Birt, 0.5.8., of
London, author of a newly-published book of more
than 1000 pages, called “Benedictine Pioneers in
Australia.” The late Cardinal wrote a voluminous
“History of the Catholic Church in Australia,” and
the book of Birt is a bitter attack upon it. He
charges his Eminence with “distortion,” with “lift-
ing” the biographies of Archbishop Polding and
Archbishop Vaughan from the Downside Review
(the English Benedictine magazine) without a word
of acknowledgment, and with various other misde-
meanors. There lias always been a feud between the
Irish-Australian Cardinal and the English Benedic-
tines, who regard him as a usurper and the grabber
of their Australian inheritance. The most valuable
part of Birt’s book is the recently-unearthed corre-
spondence of Dr. Polding, the first Archbishop of
Sydney. In one letter the Archbishop, discussing
Parkes, described him as positively “hateful in my
sight.”
HOME AGAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The stress of fighting being over, and Ministerial-
ists being sure of success, the announcement has
been made that Mr. Murray, the Premier, has, for
some time, been anxious to leave the Ministry. Only
a desire to lead his party to victory, it is said, in-
duced him to hold on so long. —Daily paper.
Our Jack’s come home to-day from sea ;
He braved no stormy blast,
Hut sailed his old tub carelessly,
And slept against the mast;
The trade winds, filled his tattered sails,
And drove him straight ahead ;
He met no Opposition gales,
And now he’s off to bed.
The manifest is poor enough ;
But cynic landsmen scoff;
They say, “Wait till we see the stuff!
Take those hatch-covers off!”
But Chief Mate Watt just leans and stares,
And looks about, and chews;
He makes no move to show the wares
They’ve brought back from their cruise.
The Ship of State is at the quay ;
Her mooring lines are out;
Her captain works no cargo. He
Keeps pottering about
From deck to pier, and pier to land,
With slow and sleepy tread,
Relinquishing his last command
To hie him off to bed.
Our Jack came home to-day from Sea,
With nothing in the hold ;
He tied his ship up wearily,
And into bunk he rolled.
He wants to drowse through all the tides ;
He hates the rolling main ;
And weed will grow on his ship’s sides
Ere he puts forth again.

Inis bank, now 70 years old, has a paid capital of
£250,000, and reserves of £623,455. When it was
50 years old, the capital was only £60,000 and the
reserves £83,492. A comparison of those two sets
of figures snows the wonderful progress made since
the discovery of the big goldfields of the West. Of
course, as tne table indicates, the very big reserves
are not all accumulated profit. When BigjohH’s
birthplace began to boom, and more capital was
called for, this bank (which had never missed a
dividend, and hasn’t missed One since) was paying
17J p.c. It was an easy matter, therefore, to get
a stiff premium on the new shares, and that very
prudent policy has been continued in connection with
all subsequent issues. Early last half-year, another
5000 £lO shares were offered to shareholders pro
rata (there were already 20,000 shares), at a premium
of £lB. In all, 4217 were applied for; the other 783,
all or most of which represented fractions, were
offered for tender, and averaged £32 7s. lid. That
looks as though the new issue, at £2B, was equiva-
lent to a bonus of £1 Is. 9d. per share to the old
shareholders. On the shares issued duing the past
20 years, the 20 p.c. div. is really equal to about
a 74 p.c. div., while to those who pay £32 the
return is only 6J p.c. There is, however, a big
difference between paying the bank itself £32 for a
£lO share, and paying somebody else the same
money. In one case, the bank gets the extra £22,
which means that the man is paying it to himself
and his partners; in the other case, somebody else
gets it. Out uo capital and reserves (= £873,455)
among the 25,000 shares, and it will be found that
there is almost £35 apiece. Assuming, then, that
the reserves actually exist —in other words, that the
assets are not overvalued —-it seems that the average
price tendered was not excessive.
The half-year’s profits were £28,110, according to
the table; and, as the bank had the use of new
capital, etc., that doesn’t show up as well as most
recent results. Actually, however, there has been
no shrinkage: the explanation lies in the fact that
the bank, having reached the three-score-and-ten,
hands out a bonus of £4700 (10 p.c.) to the staff.
(And in this connection it would be hard to say
which of the two top-notchers treats its staff the
better —the Commercial of Sydney or the Westralian.)
Even if the half-year’s profit is taken at £32,810, it
doesn’t show a high return on the shareholders’ funds.
As an average the earnings are about £7 17s. 6d.
p.c., calculated on capital and reserves combined.
But before judging that return, some of these figures
ought to be considered: —

hirst, this shows that no less than 42 p.c. of all
the deposits and other public money is in liquid
assets; and the great bulk of that total is unproduc-
tive coin and bullion. Then the total of the public’s
money, including the unproductive coin and bullion,
is only 31 times greater than the shareholders’
funds; and’ that is an unusually small proportion.
Between them, these two things account for the
comparatively low earnings; hence it is not neces-
sary to assume that the assets are overvalued, or any
of the advances unproductive. A further point in
the co.’s favor is the small amount at which the
premises stand: it seems highly probable that a
good deal has been spent on this account, and charged
up to working expenses. The bank confines itself to
Westralia, and it is doubtful whether the agricul-
tural Business of that State will move ahead fast
enough to counterbalance the decline in the gold-
getting business. Apart from that the bank s posi-
tion is very strong, and the foundations are laid for
a much bigger business. # ,

When the Great Boom broke, 18 years ago, there
were four Australian batiks with head-offices in Lon-
don. Two of them pulled through without re-
construction ; the other two, having less “nerve’
than the boomsters who in those days managed most
Australian financial concerns, made what has
often since been referred to as a “poor bargain”
with their creditors. On the reconstruction, E., S.
and A. shareholders undertook to pay depositors 4
p.c. on one-half and 4 § p.c. on the other half of
their locked-up money. Unfortunately, a, very great
deal of this money was sunk in securities which
were earning little, if anything; consequently, the
struggle to pay 4- and 41 p.c. presently became so
severe that the directors had to beg for mercy. They
got moderation. Practically, the arrangement
meant: “Pay us 4 p.c. on one-half as a regular thing
and pay us k 47 p.c. on the other half when you can.
When you can’t, pay us 3 p.c.” But the share-
holders had to further agree that profits should
be divided this way: (1) £15,000 to a reserve for
securing interest on the deferred stock, representing
about one-fourth of the old debt, and for general
purposes ; (2) to pay the extra 17 p.c. interest before-
mentioned ; and (3) one-fourth of any balance to re-
purchase the deferred stock. So far as the creditors
were concerned, it was a good deal less like buc-
caneering than some lots were subjected to by the
dreadful boomsters who were the Australian finan-
ciers of the day, and some of whom still pose before
Fisher and Hughes as authorities on honest banking.
The old debt was divided into four sections, and
this shows the progress made in getting rid of it
since the rearrangement in 1896: —

£3,573,178 £2,632,466 £2,620,966
The deferred stock is being slowly paid off out of
profits ; as above-mentioned, one-fourth of the profit,
after various pieces have been bitten out of it, must
go that way. In 1910 this one-fourth was £10,789,
and that sum repurchased £11,500 (face value) of
the stock. That explains the £7ll of profit shown
as having been made on the repurchase of old de-
posits last year. It would be quite legitimate to
show this £11,500 as added to reserves; but as pro-
bably some of the assets are still over-valued, the
directors do the far better thing of writing the
amount off. These and other sums are coming off
bank premises account, which, nevertheless, still
stands at £316,200 —a shocking amount of its capi-
tal for a bank of this size to have locked up.
As the table shows, profits have been climbing up
very persistently. It will be noticed also that they
are nearly five times greater now than they were in
1899—12 years ago. The fact is those profits are
only the amount available for the holder of the third
mortgage. The stockholders have a first mortgage
(of course, after the new creditors of the bank
have been satisfied) ; then comes the extra
14 p.e. to represent the second mortgage;
what is left appears as profit. At present
the old deposits stand at £2,632,466. If, by
reason of anything unpleasant, that money should
bring in only 4 p.c. less, down would flop the
profits £13,162. This explains why the profits in
this bank will be liable to severe fluctuations. Also,
when you are thinking of dividends, it has to be re-
membered that a first bite of £15,000 must go to
reserves, and when the bank says it has made £4
beyond that, it can only divide £3. Certainly this
compulsory saving-up will be good for somebody by-
and-bye ; but by-and-bye is so indefinite, and may be
so remote, and so many things may get in the way,
that the most philanthropic Cohen in the city
wouldn’t advance a shareholder thickthpenth on the
prospects.
New business is rapidly improving as far as one
can tell from surface prospects. Compare this year’s
figures with last year’s:—

There should be money in that big increase in
advances. But there is another consideration. Of
shareholders’ own money in the business (capital
and reserves) there is £798,617 ; of other people’s
money there is no less than £8,520,937. In other
words, shareholders’ £1 has to protect the invest-
ment of about £ll 10s. It is a very serious risk.
Certainly it ought to mean big profits; but even as
to that the shareholders don’t benefit as much as
usual, on account of the big lump of debt which
carries 4 and 44 p.c. The cash position is strong;
the bank holds liquid no less than 55 p.c. of its
liabilities, exclusive of the old debt, which is fixed
tight. And finally, so far as new creditors are con-
cerned, they are in the excellent position of bmng
protected by the stock representing the old depw.-.its,
as well as by the share capital and reserves.

In proportion to its risks this is one of the strongest
offices in Australasia. Its capital is £lOO,OOO, in
200,000 shares of £lO each, paid to 10s. ; so, be-
sides the paid capital, there is £1,900,000 for
which the shareholders are liable. Its reserves, as
shown above, are £321,288. The net premium
income last year was £135,13,8. Thus paid capital
and reserves combined are equal to 311 p.c. of the
year’s premium income; and that income is the
handiest measure of the year’s risks. Taking the
20 leading British offices, the aggregate capital and
reserves are equal to only 164 p.c. of the aggregate
premium income. On this showing the position of
the National of Maoriland is nearly twice as strong
as that of the average British office. To a great
extent this is due to the fact that the National
hasn’t been getting new business at a very rapid
rate; for obviously a moderate-sized co. that rushes
around and adds £lOO,OOO of premium income in
a couple of years can’t be expected to add £lOO,OOO
to its reserve funds in the same time, whereas the
co. of the same size that adds only £5OOO a year to
its risks may comfortably add much more than that
to its accumulated profits. From the shareholder’s
point of view, the great strength of the funds in pro-
portion to the risks isn’t therefore an unmixed bless-
ing; but from the policy-holder’s point of view it is
just the thing.
Further digging into this co.’s accounts gives
these results: —

The loss rate is rather high, and the expense rate
pretty low. Both features are probably due in part
to the fact that the co. does a big marine business —
a business which, coming in big lumps, doesn’t cost
much to get, but usually costs a good deal to keep.
The least satisfactory thing about the accounts is
the disposal of the assets. Of all the assets
( £455,457), advances on mortgage represent no less
than £251,505, and “debentures” (nature unspeci-
fied) £103,400. This looks like nailing down the
funds in a business in which large amounts may con-
ceivably be wanted in a violent hurry; and these
don’t look the kind of assets that can be realised in
a hurry without loss. Nor is there any counterbal-
ancing corpulence in the interest return; on the
average of the invested funds it was last year about
£4 14s. 6d. p.c. Nevertheless, the reserves are so
very substantial that the interest earnings are equal
to p.c. on the capital, leaving all but about
£l5OO of the profit from underwriting to go towards
the further strengthening of a position which was
extraordinarily strong already—assuming that the
mortgages and the debentures are worth 205.,' or
thereabouts, in the £ of their book value.

Profits have shrunk a trifle, mainly, no doubt, because
average prices for wool and most other station goods
were not as high in the past year as in the year
before; and that meant smaller commission earnings
even if the turnover had been the same. Also, it is
probable that there hasn’t been quite as much doing
in the sale of pastoral properties—except for farm
subdivisions, and these big wool cos. haven’t laid
themselves out specially for that class of business.
According to N.S.W. Statistician Trivett’s table, pas-
toral products which would have averaged £lOOO in
1901 were worth £1137 in 1909, and £1214 in
1910; but in the early part of this year there was
a shrinkage, and, by the middle of the year, the level
was down to £ll5l. It is just about as certain as
anything can be that the 1910 figures were abnormal;
therefore, - the commission earnings in that year
were abnormal also, and will not be realised in the
future, unless the shrinkage in value can be made
good by an increase in the turnover. The sheep in
N. S. Wales increased from 26 millions in 1903 to
46 millions at the last annual count, and that
meant 415,338,0001 b. of greasy wool, instead of
217,411,0001 b. There is a limit to this growth. In
ordinary seasons tjie State can no doubt carry more
than 46 million sheep. Unfortunately, in a bad sea-
son, you can’t suspend the animation of your sheep,
and set them going again when there is grass and
water. The sheep that dies dies for good. Hence,
we may take it that, just as in 1902 something
like 15 million sheep died, so in some future year
there will be another slaughter, followed by a slump
in the wool clip, and a slump in the commissions
earned on sales. In the past the wool cos. were
hit not only by reduced earnings in that way, but
also by lo.sses on advances. They are nearly all
struggling nowadays to keep out of the advance
business; but it has yet: to be seen whether they
won’t be squeezed into it, more or less, in order to
keep their agency business.
The co.’s paid capital is £100,000; and the
original cost of the freehold properties—mostly wool
stores, etc. —was £190,626. Only a small part of
this has been added lately. Necessarily, the co. had
to put a very big plaster on the premises. In the
earlier years, as this debt was paid off out of surplus
profit, the premises were written down; : so that the
£67,656 of present reserves doesn’t represent all the
surplus earnings. This shows that and other things:

And meantime about £ll,OOO has been spent on

part of the money has been used in wiping out debt
and thus saving interest.

This co. and its predecessors used to chase business
among the saltbush of the Darling country, and,
when drought struck the mostly over-stocked hold-
ings—overstocked partly with rabbits and partly
with sheep—the co. had to sit down on its swag
and wonder where the next bit of tucker was to
oome from. The trouble with nearly all way-
back traders is that they have to give long
credit: in the jumbuck country it’s “Pay
after the shearing”; in the wheat land the
farmer gives “February bills.” If the sheep dies
and can’t be shorn, or if the drought happens and
the wheat can’t be harvested, the way-back supplier
has to consider whether he will cut biis loss and the
prospect of future business, or carry the hard-up
on for another year. It was E. Rich and Co.’s bad
luck that they struck several bad years; and evi-
dently in nursing others they got so sick themselves
that they had to be nursed in the end. Thus, for
some years, the co. was housed in Dalgety’s office
in London, and Dalgety’s people really ran the show.
Then good seasons came along, the country client paid
up promptly, and the position was so improved that
about two years ago the co. was able to leave the
hospital. The management was then transferred
from London to Australia, recently the old London
Board was disbanded, and the co. set itself to de-
velop a city business, so that it might have two
strings to its bow. More recently still, it decided
that there was a better opening in Queensland, and
Brisbane has been getting a lot of attention during
the past year. The capital is £198,037 ; liabilities
total £77,812, including £25,190 of overdrafts and
£17,250 of mortgages. On the other side, stock
represents £140,741, premises and plant £52,416
and book debts £91,762. Capital and reserves com-
bined show a visible profit of 6f p.c.; and, consider-
ing the wonderfully good times, and the pretty large
risks of the business, this is so much under the
mark that it suggests two things: (1.) There may

After hosing down the dissecting table, this post-
mortemist picked up the next corpse. There were
some curious points of resemblance between the one
that had just been under the knife, and the other
one that was waiting to go. Both were Maori-
landers, both were born in 1873, and both had their
headquarters in Dunedin. But there the similarity
stopped short. One was a fire and marine insurance
concern; the other is this Mosgiel Woollen Factory
Co. The insurance concern has a paid capital of
£lOO,OOO ; this other one is close up with £83,457.
But, while the former is paying a dividend of 20
P-c., and has, for all that, accumulated profits
amounting to £321,288, this industrial co. is paying
only 6 p.e. now, and, a while ago, paid as little as
p.c., and yet its accumulated profits amount to
only £18,303. Nevertheless, it can’t be for a
moment suggested that the Mosgiel doesn’t provide as
good goods as the National Insurance ; and, since the
factory co. probably employs, one way and another,
twice as many Maorilanders as the insurance co., it
looks as though the factory co. is the better worth
cultivating from the national point of view. But, no
matter how much better worth cultivating it may
be, there is the fact —6 p.c. for the one and 20 p.c.
for the other; a poor little £18,303 of reserves for
the one and , £321,288 for the other. Frankly, on
that experience, can Maoriland wonder that people
with money don’t put it into labor-employing indus-
tries if they can possibly find an investment in a
non-producing financial concern? Yet there is the
trade waiting to be done, if it were protected: of
woollen piece-goods alone Maoriland is buying
£225,000 every year from the foreigner—and, inci-
dentally, starving the home factory in the process.
Still, Mosgiel, having made a fine name for its
goods, and never having paid bigger divs. than it
could afford, is in a far better position than most.
For one thing, it has kept tolerably free from debt;
its liabilities are £14,930, and it seems to have
kept its plant written well down. That is to say, it
seems to have put by, out of revenue, reasonable
amounts to provide for renewals —and the neglect
to do that has been one of the worst effects of the
poverty of many Australasian industries. Practically
all its capital and reserves are in plant and stock;
premises stand for under £lO,OOO, and book debts
are £8528 —the latter a very good indication that
the co. isn’t likely to make big losses that way,
anyhow.

The co. has been launching out a bit during the
last two or three years, and seems to have thus
checked the persistent slump in its profits. At the
same time it is carrying bigger risks these days.
Five years ago, for instance, its liabilities were
£14,900, and now they are £45,892 ; and very
nearly all the difference between those two amounts
is represented on the other side by “accounts and
advances owing to the co.” In proportion to capi-
tal ( £8500) the debts now look heavy; -but the
visible reserves are greater than the capital, and
reserves are as good as capital any day. They are
apparently real reserves, too, because the assets
seem to have been kept written down to bedrock
—if not lower.

This little society’s advances have moved along as
follows: 1908, £6571 ; 1909, £7553 ; 1910, £8457 ;
1911, £10,229. The loans are all made apparently
on building society terms; that is to say, the ad-
vance is a continually diminishing quantity, ah. I the
longer it is in existence the better the society is pro-
tected against a slump in values. Risks are, there-
fore, not very great, except where there is a big
sudden increase in the advances, followed by a big
sudden drop in values. In this ease the risk is
diminished by reason of the fact that the co. trades
only on its own money; it takes no deposits, and,
therefore, hasn’t got to make good the losses that
may be made in the investment of other people’s
money. That, of course, also means modest earnings.
But the man who can’t afford to lose his principal
had better not look for any 10 or 20 p.c. earnings.

But, as this paper has said a few times before, a
mining co.’s alleged reserves are liable to be a
delusion and a snare. Reserves are supposed to be
assets held in excess of capital. The bulk ( £100,996)
of the capital in this case is represented by the mine,
and this mine is rapidly becoming a mere hole in the
ground. It never was half as good as its optimistic
barracliers alleged that it was. At the recent rate
of extraction there is only enough ore to keep the
mill going for 24 years, and the developments at the
bottom level have been shockingly disappointing.
Four years will probably see the mine practically
exhausted, assuming that production is maintained at
about 70,000 tons per half-year. Notwithstanding all
that, the mine is still valued at the old figure. In
the attempt to prolong the life of the co., the man-
agement has been buying slime 'dumps from the
British, Block 14 and North Cos., and this material
will be put through the flotation plant, which is now
getting the finishing touches on the mine. The
directors merely remark that the dumps run to
221,300 tons. They don’t say the prices paid for
the stuff; they don’t even mention that a good
many Broken Hill mining men gasped when they
heard the figures. Besides this awkward purchased
stuff, the co. has about 55,000 tons of its own
slimes and 61,510 tons of zincy tailings. It has
of course made a great deal more tailings than that,
but it sold them some time ago.
Two years ago the Junction North’s liquid assets
(including not-very-liquid stores) were £26,604 in
excess of liabilities. Twelve _ months ago (one divi-
dend of £9OOO having been paid meantime) the
surplus was £25,059. So that year’s work really
gave the co. £7455 over and above what it spent
on mine and plant. The present surplus is £41,702,
reckoning the £22.500 deposit paid on slimes as a
liquid asset, which it isn’t. During the year
£36,000 has been paid in divs. The year has there

Great Britain Tin Sluicing Co. pays a
22nd div. to its Sydney shareholders out ot £t
Emmaville (N.S.W.) ground. The directors looked
well ahead in the matter of water supply, so it has
been able to take uninterrupted advantage of the
good metal market. Costs have always been on the
heavy side, especially as there lias been litt •
ing to do. The No. 2 plant, on Moore and Spear s
ground, is pretty well through its i ob ; there won t
be much to sluice there after the middle of next
year. # * *
Bourke’s Hill, Emmaville < N.S.W.), ha?

is looking at-last to its water supply; rt■ m ’ making
surveys in connection with a pumping se v •
the Severn River. No div. has been paid since
March, and No. 2 plant has been hung up for a year
all through the bad water supply. With a good
service and a favorable tin market, there should be
very fair profits for five years at least. #
Neeld’s, the original prospecting area of
Wyalong (N.S.W.), which yielded a large amount
of gold down to the 400 ft., is in a bad way. Be-
sides the prospecting with the gad and hammer at
the 850 ft. in search of the lost reef, a plant lent by
the Mines Department has been boring ; but nothing
has been found, and* this work has been stopped.
Baker’s Creek,* Hillgrove (N.S.W.), closed

holders will have to be asked for some more For
the half-year the co. crushed 600 tons for ij s .?® 2 /’
but -898 oz. of this was produced by small tribute
parties. The stone crushed on the co. s account
doesn’t appear to have been remunerative. I respect-
ing is going on at No. 11 and No 12 levels, but so
far nothing much good has been discovered. In the
struggle to keep the pot boiling it is intended to
cyanide some of the tailings. * #
Tolwong (N.S.W.), the mixed-metal pro-
position which came a cropper over treatment diffi-
culties, hasn’t done anything yet to prove- that it
has solved the riddle; but it is developing some

copper veins are very narrow where they are not
very poor. . # *
Grafton Copper (N.S.W.), for a run of
four weeks, smelted 906 tons of ore, for matte con
taining 75 tons copper, so the extraction is averag-
ing considerably over 8 p.c. The wood supply is
now abundant, and that is a most important con-
sideration. The ore raised for the month _ was 889
tons, worth 9.5 p.c. copper. Manager Mulligan, who
has been at the helm so long, has resigned, and
metallurgist Armstrong takes up the running. Last
week the roof of No. 2 furnace fell in, but very little
time was lost, as No. 4 furnace was put in com-
mission. The Grafton’s ore occurs m irregular
shoots, so the actually proved reserves of high-
grade ore in sight are only moderate, and develop-
ment work will have to be kept well forward if the
furnaces are to do their best work.

As nobody seems’to have a word to say
against the Lake View-Oroya Exploration amalga-
mation, everyone must be satisfied. In the case of
the former co. the proposed fusion marks another
important shuffle in the history of a remarkable con-
cern. Floated in 1896 to acquire the Lake View
leases at Kalgoorlie, it recovered between that date
and April, 1910, over 4J millions sterlnig and pai
nearly £1,500,000 in dividends. It then parted
with the property, together with £15,000, toi
500,000 paid-up shares in the Lake View and Star
a corporation formed to take over the Lake V e
and Hannan’s Star mines. The Lake View tailings
dump, however, was not included in the sale, and
from this a good deal of profit has since been ob
tained. In May last Lake View shareholders sanc-
tioned a reorganisation scheme, and the boiling
down of the co.’s nominal capital from. £300,000 to
£150,000. The official reason for this was that, as
the Lake View leases had been amalgamated with
other shows in which the co. held a controlling in-
terest, its basis as -a mining co. technically disap-
peared as soon as the work of re-treating the residue
dumps was finished. On the date of the meeting’ i
value of the co.’s assets, consisting entirely of cash,
loans and shares in other cos., was estimated at
£350 000 Oroya Exploration holds big interests
in some and whole interests in other attractive
mines, but is badly off for capital for development
and plant. It gets what it wants by throwing in its
lot with the Lake View One result of amalga-
mation will be the rapid equipment of the Queen ot
the Hills (Meekatharra) and the Transvaal (Southern
Cross), and also the exploitation of the IngHston
United (Meekatharra) and other properties tiiat
general managers (8., M. and Co.) have their y
on. With a big holding in the Yuanmi, Lake: View
and Star and Mountain (W.A.), and in the
Zinc-South Blocks (Broken Hill), and with £60,000
worth of 4 n.c. to 5 p.c. investments, the new co.
promises to soon pay divs. The interests of the
small shareholder, to whom prompt pay means
much, would be better protected, however, if a lot
of the oil interests and other dubious sundries which
the Lake View now has on its shelves, were ire
out. They have depreciated enough in value
14a H. (W.A.) reports that its income for
the 18 months ended June last was £55,341. A er
paying working expenses and proVidmgkfOT develop
ment, depreciation, etc., there was not sufficient left
to give shareholders anything. At the date of the
balance-sheet the paid capital stood at Lfi^OOO.a 1
additional 20,000 shares having been issued as com
sideration for a prospecting license Nigeria, while
42,000 shares were subscribed out of the 60,00
shares offered in April at 3s. premium. These
42,000 shares are only Is. paid (plus premium), a
as the co. has £13,000 in hand, the financial post
tion is all right. With regard to ore reserves—
which in March last the late manager estimated at
25,700 tons, containing 20,7420 z. —it is now stated
that the difference in the values reported by the old
and the new management is largely due to _ the
former’s averages being taken over a working width
of Oft Stoping less than Oft, would, the directors
now admit, result in “enrichment of treatment, but
scarcely “economy in cost.” Attention is particu-
larly directed to what is termed the unprecedented
Holiness of the lode in the north end ot the mine at
depth ; but since then there has been a falling oft in
both width and value.

On September 30, Golden Ridge (W.A.)
had the following cash assets: Fixed deposits (two
years’ currency), £5000; bullion reserve; £4OOO,
ini ant renewal, £1670 ; current account, £5364,
total £16,033. In addition to the 25,000 tons ot
43s ore mentioned in a recent par., the manager es-
timates that 4000 tons of sands, 7000 tons of slunes
and 104 tons of concentrates, of a recoverable value
of 95., 13s. and 90s. respectively, remain to be
treated.

Associated Northern has just been advised
bv its general manager to acquire the Gimlet South
Extended at Oro Banda (W.A.). The inivcdia-sc price
is something over £20,000, and against this there is
estimated to be £200,000 worth of low-grade oxi-
dised ore in sight, of which £70,000 is considered
to be dear profit.’ Maybe the big expenditure that
will have to be incurred before a start can be made
to prove whether this profit is there or not, will
scare the co. from going on with the option.

Paynes’ Find Development Co. (W.A.) has
dumped a mill on its show within a tew weeks of
flotation, and crushing with five head ot stamps is
expected to start early in December. Hopes are built
high on the prospects, but the action, of the co. in
rushing ore treatment seems to indicate that the
tendency on the part of weakly-financed con-
cerns to get a mill started, and trustt to tack to
keen it going, has got hold ot it. it is generally
a poor look-out for shareholders when initial mining
development is allowed to play second fiddle to the
gouging out and treatment ot rich patches of ore
That is to say, for shareholders who don t get out
while the rich patches are being sent to market.
“Yaloginda” : The mines at Meekatharra
(W.A.) keep steadily adding to the gold output, and
would do a lot more if a little more, horse-sense was
employed. Treatment plants were mostly second .
hand when erected on the shows, and are now choice
snecimens of the scrap-heap breed. The stamps are
iust about fit to crush coffee beans, and the rock-
breakers just big enough to bruise the feeder s heart
Nearly all the cos. have reserves of law hide ana
fencing-wire for repairing purposes Ten-head is
the biggest battery, and at present rate ot treat
ment some of the mines have 20 years ore in sight.
The Fenian, Marmont, and Consols are paying divi-
dends. The Ingliston Extended hasn t handed
anything yet, though for some time past a fan
monthly profit has been made —on paper. tne
Pioneer (option turned down by Hans Irvine)
sending away 30dwt. dirt. The collection of scrap-
iron and kerosene tins, called the State battery, is
severely left alone by prospectors; they prefer to
handle their stuff twice, pay rail, and sell on an
assay to the Great Fingall Co. (which runs its plant
on philanthropic lines, of course), rather than treat
at Hie State mill. It ought to be somebody s busi
ness to see into that disgrace.
Evidence of Pietro Cerruti before the
rommission on Lung Disease, m Perth. lie naa
been identified as a contractor with the Great Fingall
mine from 1899 to 1902.... At one time he had no
fewer than 250 Italians working for him. Of these,
about 100 had died from miners complaint. It
sounds vague, and Pietro may hav a knife to
sharnen • but it’s the sort of allegation that ought
to send’ a few sleuths *on the scent. And they
shouldn’t be the sleuths who should have reporte
these things if they had happened, either. *
E Protheroe Jones, secretary of the
Golden Horseshoe, has been visiting the mine, ana
last month cabled the following impressions to the
London Board: “Scarcity of labor still continues,
and prevents the extraction of sufficient ore to keep
the plant working to its full capacity. The more
rigid enforcement of the regulations regarding em-
ployment of foreigners accentuates the difficulty. . .
I do not think that returns for this year will reach
£4O 000 per month, and lower figures may be e -
pected. It is quite impossible to form any nearer
estimate. Expenditure on plant has practically com
to an end, and the economies rendered feasible
through the recent additions fully justify the expen-
diture even on the present tonnage. Outside of the
barren rock in the slides, grade of ore is improved,
and the workings are more satisfactory than have
been the case for a considerable time past. . . The
opinion of men fully qualified to judge is that the
mine is the best in the district. This is based on
the numerous lodes, their westerly and southerly
trend the greatly improved value of the lodes below
2200 ft and the indications of their deep-seated
origin.’’ The hand is the hand of Jones; but whose
voice is it?

Mount Elliott (Q.) pays ss. per share in
December, making a total of 205., less British in-
come tax of is. 2d. in the £. The October run was
a record; 601 tons of copper came from 4664 tons
of ore, a remarkably fine average of 12.9 p.e. All
round, the average for gold has been a shade under
sdwt. ; total for two months, 21620 z. from 9173
tons; total copper, 1156 tons. The blister copper is
shipped from Townsville to Europe, which is a
mighty poor return by this English co. for the
liberal treatment it gets from Australia in th
matter of railway freights. In the mine, No. 4 level
is producing good grade sulphide ore, and there is a
good chance that winzing on the strong makes of ore
below No. 4 will locate deeper deposits. The Lime
stone mine is developing well. Mount Elliott has
147,518 shares issued, so the forthcoming divide
will cost £36,879. The option to take shares at
£5 wasn’t fully availed of.
Hampden-Cloncurry (Q.) is' pushing on
with its new plant. The capacity of its jater-
iacket furnaces is to be. more than doubled (in
September the co. sent 409 tons matte to Mount
Flliott converters) ; and its own converters shou
be capable of producing 700 tons of blister a montk
The railway to this co. s Duchess mine should be
finished early next year, though weather and labor
supply will have a say in fixing the exact date.
Queensland Railway Commissioner Evans
was bailed up at Charters Towers the other day, and
Tsked to hand over a line to Join up with Blair
Athol coalfield. A local alderman had made a re-
port and Evans was therein told that the line would
be only 200 miles long, and wouldn’t cost more than
£650,000. Naturally he replied that he didn t have
a 200-mile railway with him, and they had better
ask the Government. The Towers plea is that it is
now a deep-sinking proposition, and the
can’t afford 30s. a ton for coal. Being only 200
miles away, they think they ought to get their fuel
for less than Mount Morgan pays; and Mount
Morgan can cart it 240 miles, and still land it at
16s. 6d. , *
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, has been
doing a good deal of dead work to secure better ven-
tilation. It has had to strip the shaft down to No. 5
level The driving of that level will be worth
witching, for it Will determine whether the shoot ot
Itone followed some 70ft. along No. 4 level, makes
at depth. Deeps have weakened m the share tmu-
ket, owing to the poorer prospects at end ot No
4 west and the bunchy appearance ot the icet going
east. It was always a capricious show.
* Kelly’s Queen Block, Charters Towers,
has 285 tons raised towards .the next crushing the
last lot of 582 tons averaged £6 Os. bd. per ton.
The deepening of the underlay shaft is of much in-
terest This hole is being sunk a few feet from the
end of the north drive, on what w a
strong shoot of mineralised stone. How far it will
go before it reaches the Brilliant Centra l boundary
is uncertain, because it is a cross reel, and may
flatten considerably before the boundary is reache .
Kelly’s crosscut for the St. George leei, at 657 ft.
vertical, has been driven 186 ft., and has been
stormed Driving has been started at 142 ft. from the

stone was mined , from the upper levels of the St.
George, and these workings have been unwatered
with considerable- difficulty. *

worked^by the late William Morgan for many years
Premier of S. Aus., and his brother. At the start
the Government of New Caledonia allowed them to
use convict labor, but when the mines opened up
well the French Government refused to allow the
conlicWto do" the work. Morgan sunk a lot of
money in the venture, and went to France to beg
thtfhe might still be allowed to employ convict.i, or
import labor to work the mines. The . n a l ? e t w

The Australian Deep Leads Trust, which

When you’ve got a dozen
different people in a house, it’s
hard to know what to give them.
Some like one thing, and some
another, and what with trying
to suit first this one and then
that one, life seems hardly worth
living. And tea’s one of the
hardest things to suit people
with—l find Robur pleases my
people better than any other.
It’s nice and mild, with a lovely
flavour, and you can always rely
on the next package being as
good as the last. It doesn’t
vary like other teas. The No. 2
is the grade 1 use, and to my
mind there’s no tea sold that’s
equal to it for boarding-house
use —it is wonderfully saving.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, November 20, 1911.
My Dear Arini. —
Captain de Moleyns, who officially heeled
and toed Lady Chelmsford on her return to
this town, is a genuine Christmas novelty and
not a revival. Private Secretary Verney
will buckle on his regimental armor some
time in March, and get back to his lighting
department in Bull’s camp. So the recently-
landed aide de Moleyns will leap into the
Y T erney niche.
Governor Chelmsford’s lawn and muslin
party, one afternoon next week, will index
the first big flutter of the homing pigeons in
their Cranbrook nest. One who’s suffered
tells me that it isn’t all champagne and
cigars to be a Voice-in-waiting, when Soci-
ety’s frills are on the green at a Governor’s
tea and bun party. When the 2000th guest
has passed in his name, fore and aft,
the Voice of the A.D.C. feels as if it had
swallowed 200 rusty nails and 20 gimlets,
and the legs that belong to the Voice begin
to sag at the knees. Then does the Caller-
out-of-names pour into the ear of his lord and
lady any old name he can eject through his
clenched teeth, and turn a glazed and infuri-
ated eye on the person who presumes to
walk the earth behind one of those double-
barrelled designations that have a fowl-roost
in the centre.
Sydney’s Mayoress is extending both hands
to bless the return of Lady Chelmsford. The
welcome home party occurs before this
reaches you, and the Mayoress’s rooms in
The Hall of City By-Laws will be the place.
The general public remains calm. No wild
outburst of joy threatens to make riotous
noises in the streets over the return of the
Baron and Baroness ‘to these shores. (N.B.
—'lf Mayor Allen Taylor would extend his
hands over this city’s «reat clean-up for an-
other year, glad sounds might float up
through the chimney-pots of humble homes.)
Mr. Henry Hamilton Osborne and Miss
Marjorie Lord are engaged. She is one of
the prettiest girls in Sydney. He may be
said to be the head of the vast Osborne clan,
inasmuch as he is the only son of his father,
who was the eldest of the pioneer Osborne
brothers. He is, of course, in the station-
owning; line of business. The bride-elect will
stay with the Geoffrey Fairfaxes for a while,
and the wedding will occur shortly after-
wards.
Talking of Osbornes, Mrs. D’Arcy Os-
borne, the handsome wife of the polo-playing
squatter, has taken a flat at Strathkyle
for the summer.
Dr. Kumin, who is to discourse on the
inner recesses of heathen hearts and other
coffee-colored topics connected with the
Soudanese in their native sand-banks, will
strike this hamlet in the latter end of next
week.
Mrs. Burdekin and her two daughters left
on the India, last Saturday. They had
intended to go overland to Melbourne, and
only changed their plans at the last moment.
As a result, many of their friends were
balked of a chance to cheer them on their
way. Mr. .Tim Allison, for example, who is
a relative, arrived from the country several
hours too late to make his farewells—too
late even to wave the umbrella of friendship.
The scrutiny of India and its marvels is to
be a quiet and leisurely one —as far as pos-
sible from the sound of Durbars and such-
like festivities.
Mr. Tennyson Smith, who romps over this
planet in order to lecture on the Tank
Stream and other desperate remedies for the
YVorld’s Thirst, rubbed noses with the Ad-
mirable King-Hall the other day. Admir-
alty House was the scene of this corroboree.
The Admirable holds out the glad salary-
hook to the Tea-total narty, being of the soft-
drink persuasion himself.
Solicitor L. C. Russell Jones is hurrying
off this continent with bag and baggage. He
is on the verge of a voyage to Europe’s chief
ports of smell. A local Welsh society sped
the fleeing Jones with a ton of good wishes
and a heavy-weight silver cigar-case. The
institution bore one of those wondrous Welsh
names which drive the anguished compositor
out into the highways and the hedges to
borrow fresh consonants.
The orange-blossom party of pretty, dark-
led ™ da Maddock > eldest daughter of Solici-
tor Maddock, of Cremorne’s water-lapped
shores, occurred in St. Philip’s Church the
other day. Bride Eda’s father is said to
have a finger in the golden pie crust of Mount
Morgan. Reginald Carter, one of the Dar-
ling Point Carters, was the lucky man. The
youthful bridesmaidens, Muriel Carter and
Dorothy Maddock, were garbed in a white
toam of lace and chiffon. Best man Aubrev
Kelynack—the single sprig left over amongst
the late Parson Kelynaclt’s numerous sons—
was m lus accustomed place, as first aid to
the bridegroom.
(P.S. The Aubrey Kelynack habit of
best-manning his friends to the altar rails
may lead him to murmur “I will,” by acci-
dent, on his own account, some time in the
present century.)
Hearts are trumps—sometimes. An-
other confirmed bachelor has revoked his affec-
tion for clubs, and admits that hearts are
good playing cards. Mr. Darrell Bensusan
(brother of the well-known Inez Bensusan),
an amateur musician of some tonnage, is
alleged to be engaged to his widowed cousin,
Mrs. Oswald Ilaes.
The Cowper family vault, in old Cobbitty
churchyard, which recently opened to swal-
low up the remains of ex-Sheriff Charles
Cowper, is one of several venerable relics
of the same kind in that tree-shaded
nook. In the old days, when Parson llassall
was chief whipper-in of souls, from Camden
to the wilds up Berrima way, every Anglican
body who counted to be a stake in the coun-
try was comfortably provided for, after
death, in a roomy underground selection in
one of Cobbitty’s household sepulchres. I
fancy Chief Justice Cullen’s dame is a grand-
daughter of the late Dean Cowper, of this
city, therefore a near relative of the late
Charles.
As a matter of sentiment, the family party
underground has held its own in our new
land. But “its own” is only second-best, as
a matter of hygiene, to the ancient habit of
burying an ancestor under the dining-table, or
some equally handy spot. Anyone who hap-
pens to meet a family vault, with its mouth
wide open (as I did in Cobbitty one summer
evening) to receive an incoming tenant, the
other tenants having mingled their dust for
40 or 50 years, will prefer to lean up against
a family urn.
Prank Coffee, of Sydney, is in America,
talking good Australian with a Yankee ac-
cent. The last number of the Ikkigation
Joubnal, the biggest thing of its kind in
the United States, carries an article on
Burrinjuck by Chief Engineer L. A. B. Wade,
and the several columns are not going to
do the Ma State any harm. An editorial
note states that the matter came through Mr.
Coffee; and a good many other things, in a
good many other papers, seem to suggest that
Mr. Coffee has been busy stirring himself and
serving up no Stinking Pish on the menu.
Artist John Longstaff has written to a
friend on this side, re the decorative efforts
of portion of the scenery on the voyage to
the Great Pog. Etna was in full fizz when
he passed, and Reggio and Messina, on either
side of the straits were en fete —brilliantly
illuminated, with a fireworks display as an
extra side-show. This magnificent realism
might be classed as “too pictorial,” by the
cult. But it seems to have knocked out, in
one round, even the Longstaff oil mixture,
and Rupert Bunny’s lovely ladies would
have paled into gentle, ghosts when Etna spat
forked flames out of its raging interior, and
breathed conflagration through its embit-
tered nose.
The Girls’ Realm Guild had a day out, at
the Zoo, on Saturday. Astounded at the in-
vasion of miles of white muslin, picked out
with blobs of heliotrope, some of the Zoo
inhabitants turned into any hiding place
available under the Restricted Area Act.
The most offended-looking person present
was the four-legged beast who led the make-
believe show of birds, insects, etc. Dame
Hay, Mrs. Curlewis (Ethel Turner) and
Miss Keep were the judges who judged
which tame animal was better than any other
little animal. Organising secretary ' Grace
Burrows side-stepped the procession (which
ran to curls and giggles). Miss Dorothy
Stephen, Miss M. Tange and Miss Maude
Scrutton also pushed hard at the Zoo party.
The G. S. Titheradge complimentary
matinee, which Hugh Ward, of the J.C.W.
co., is helping to push into a large and pros-
perous money-spinner, has been postponed till
next week. The committee which is in
charge of the hard cash proposition—a purse
of sovereigns—bristles with names well
known to all and sundry. George Rignold
lends his aid. P. F. Marich gives a shove.
Hop, who occupies a stately strong-
hold in these premises, gives another push.
J. F. Archibald, who originally used an in-
candescent pen in the same building, J. D.
Fitzgerald, Allan Hamilton, Lachlan Beaton,
Leonard Dodds, Dr. Burne, John Leete and
Knight W. Patrick Manning are hot on the
trail of a fat testimonial to G. S. Tith.
Songster Sylvia Blackston, of this side,
drops in a line from ’Frisco (U.S.), where
she’s been chirping for the Pacific Musical
Society.. Sylvia says the city of the great
’quake is a cheerful resurrection blazing
with intelligence, electricity and other signs
of the times, though a few ruins recall the
mighty upheaval of a few years back. The
girl found ’Frisco a goodly place, flowing
with cheap fruit and nice hats of consider-
able post. She was booked for a concert
trail in North America when she posted her
’Frisco coo-ee.
From a friend in London
Ola Jane Humphrey, who was imprudent enough
to marry the Egyptian Prince Hassan, is here seek-
ing a divorce, and pouring her woes into the ears
of the interviewers. Ola Jane says she now sadly
realises the truth of Kipling’s—
“Oh, East is East and West is West,
And never the twain shall meet.”
She got her first idea of the Egyptian outlook on
women when she arrived in Paris with her Prince, a
few days after the marriage in a London registry
office, and her experience after that episode quite
persuaded her that a white woman who marries a
colored person seeks trouble and finds it.
The Melba opera boom in this city has left
a seething backwash of students’ concerts —
as mentioned in my last letter to you. One
girl’s voice, a mezzo soprano of fine quality,
raised its tuneful lilt rather above some
other lilts, last week. Miss Emma Fran-
ceschi, the young daughter of Lismore’s
Italian Dr. Franceschi, was the songstress.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, and sundries
(the individual who always makes such a
good score in the cricket match) conspired
together and urged the girl to repeat her
success in this town. So the Franceschi
mezzo soprano will again riot round the
chaste atmosphere of the Y.M.C.A. Hall.
November 30 is the date.
Contralto Ella Caspers, of this patch,
has been resting her voice-box in Germany
for a summer holiday. The girl then spec!
back to the Thames village, to meet those
persons who make large and affluent engage-
ments for. songbirds of note. At a private
recital, given to musical experts, Ella
warbled with such success that she has now
planted both feet two steps higher in the
London concert engagement climb. The
Goulburn singer snatched an appearance at
the Royal Albert Hall, under gilt-edged
conditions, and has booked her contralto for
opera and oratorio with equally pleasing
trimmings.
The Melba presentation fund is still tear-
ing through the air. “Early in 1912” is the
approximate date when gold plate will be
wheeled in a barrow to the Victorian sky-
lark, and Sydney Town Hall will be the
place. Mayor Allan Taylor is chairman.
Hon. treasurers Harry Levy and R. M. Pitt
wait for the thud of the falling of great bags
of specie.
Private-view day in the R. A. Society’s
rooms, artist Joe Wolinski’s brusliwork
being on the walls, drew an invitation crowd
which panted under tibe glass roof forcing-
frame. The afternoon was situated on the
tail of a heat wave. Tomatoes are late and
scarce this year. The R.A.S. glass-house
would be a capital forcing bed. Minister for
Agriculture Trefle might look into this mat-
ter, and try intense culture at 76 Pitt-street,
in an experimental roof garden, where the
shy asparagus and early cauliflower would
blow at fabulous prices. In the meantime,
visitors to these rooms will continue to hang
out their tongues in a shade temperature of
2000 deg. or so, above bailing point.
Artists may have nerves, but they train
them over casHron frames, and show their
staying powers by climbing over mountain-
ous lifts, and toiling up steep staircases, to
see what mistakes the other fellow’s been up
to. At the Wolinski private view, the local
artist was fresh and chirpy, showed no signs
of going to pieces under the weather, put a
critical nose into his catalogue, and refrained
from falling down exhausted, like less hardy
plants. Julian Ashton took a personally-
conducted tour round the R.A.S. hot-house.
Mildred Lovett, also of the Society of
Artists’ workshop, poised on the wing at 76
Pitt-street, before her annual migration to
the Apple Island. Florence Rodway mean-
dered gently round the Wolinski brushware;
and G. W. Hadfield, the most incurable op-
timist who ever hung out for pleasure at the
Sign of the Palette, did the show to the last
drop of perspiration.
“A London Coffee Stall’' is the finest Wol-
inski effort now on view, in spite of “Mem-
ories,” which are worth 300 guineas, and
bear the 1911 brand of the Paris Salon. “A
Ghetto School” (another Paris Salon sam-
ple) is a clever picture in subdued
tones. These same tones give “Memories”
and “A London Coffee Stall” a mellow rich-
ness of coloring which the plain citizen feels
he can understand and live with. One artist
objected to the 100-guinea “Coffee Stall” on
the ground that it was “too pictorial.” It
tells a story bf London East, and was
sketched from life. The flare of a lighted
match on one semi-submerged nose —which
shows roseate signs of another flare, the
hopeless dejection of a down-at-the-heel cof-
fee strainer, and the technique which puts
this poverty on canvas, and makes it throb
with the realities of life, may be pictorial.
If so, artist Joe, who looks in the pink of
condition (with a vanishing waist-line (ought
to go on and do it again.
When a Coogee Bay shark goes surfing
he generally takes a sporting chance of hav-
ing a snack of musical comedy actress. But
the lady is happily washed ashore—in
her normal health, and with all her
limbs intact, and gets no damages
except a ripping advt. The Bondi surfing
beast won’t touch the theatricals, and merely
hunts the deep-sea salmon to its moor-
ings, on the lee side of a 15ft. breaker. On
Sunday, two of these wild animals
pushed their inquiring fins right up along-
side male legs on the Bondi water front,
but they were only chasing a school of sal-
mon to the edge of the desirable building
lots in these parts. The lady surfer, out
there, has taken to stockings and sandal
shoes this season. Meantime, an epidemic
amongst salmon —hastened by the shark —-
has distributed gills, whiskers, fins, etc., in
a messy morgue here and there.
One result of the Sheffield Choir attack
on these States is the uprising of Yorkshire
Societies in Melbourne and Adelaide, and
the resuscitation of the Yorkshire Society in
this city. Its light, which was inclined to
flicker a year or two ago, now blazes with
about two billion candle-power. Mr. W.
Atkins, one of its leading illuminations, and
Mr. Townsend, with many other Yorkshire
terriers, will have barked together in great
amity at Hart’s Cafe before this meets your
eye, my long-distance Arini.
The new Daylight Saving Conspiracy, in
this State, threatens to dig the population
out of bed as soon as the sun slips over the
eastern wash of the blue Pacific. Chief
Railway-man Johnson is pondering over the
early-rising engine, as a special screamer to
tug the 5 a.m. traveller to his city lair. The
Mother of Nine, who sees the coming of the
4 a.m. breakfast, will probably readjust her
time-table, so as to dodge the wasteful pro-
cess of going to sleep. As thus :
Midnight: Still patching Tommy’s pants.
1 a.m.: Darned the last rung of the Jacob’s ladder
on Matilda’s stocking.
1.30 a.m.: Getting sleepy.
2 a.m.: Forgot to put the milk-can out. Did so.
3 a.m.: Milkman says it’s raining hard, and he
can’t find any daylight to save. (Some of the rain
got into the milk.)
4 a.m.: Had breakfast. Still saving the daylight,
and expect a big gas bill.
4.30 a.m.: Children left for school. Insisted on
Tommy walking ahead with the lantern. Hope to
save quite a large area of daylight. Will give the
proceeds to the gas company.
An Australian abroad sends me a Glasgow
paper which has a pain in its inside columns.
The pain is in the same old place. Scotia’s
domestic help having risen up in Glasgow, is
firing off letters to the editor, and is being-
answered (at a white heat) by her astonished
ex-mistress.
The British Lady of the Broom now shows
a reasonable desire to emerge from the for-
mer place—under the backstairs. Glasgie’s
Janet on the warpath, writes in this style:
“‘Who were you with last?’ says she (i.e.,
the would-be employer). ‘Two ladies,’ said I.
‘Well,’ says she, ‘I don’t think you’ll suit
my place.’ ‘No,’ says I, ‘whenever I saw
your face I kenned you wouldna’ suit me.’ ”
Another Glasgie handmaiden, named
Sally, suggests that as the maid in her exit
has to get her “character” from her ex-mis-
tress, the ex-mistress should be obliged to
have her character written by the departing
light of her kitchen. Sally, who calls the
average mistress “a stairhead brawler,”
would probably shake a lively pen on the
seamy side of life above stairs.
In bitterness of spirit, an English male
critic has recently unloaded his feelings to
an inquiring halfpenny paper: “The ghost of
a mad hatter —if not Lewis Carroll’s Mad
Hatter himself —seems to have inspired de-
signers of feminine millinery this season.”
Here are some suggestions for a hat (if
trimmed at home), which this reliable au-
thority, after gluing his nose for some weeks
to the plateglass windows of Oxford-street,
London, dotted down on his shirt-cuff: —
A sugar-loaf hat, of indefinite shape, turned up
at the side with small balls of knitting-wool.
Similar hat turned up with a knot of white wool,
ends heavily tipped with black horns.
Small hat, of no shape, trimmed with five young
sparrows (dead).
Hat garnished with tomatoes, apples and seashore
thistles. This should look as if an angry husband
had jumped on its crown.
The critic concludes by flinging in a recipe
for a really fashionable 1911-12 hat. “Take
a bath towel, mix up some ragged muslin,
throw in some expensive aigrettes, and call
it ‘the present mode.’ ”
Miss Sulman, who’s just back from a
scamper through the land of the early-rising
Jap, trotted out some of her heathen remin-
iscences to the ’Varsity Women’s Union,
the other evening. She says that the
meek-looking little brown lady with the
sleepy velvet eyes isn’t quite so down-trod-
den, on the domestic side, as the “Madame
Butterfly” opera suggests she may be in her
love affairs. Little Mrs. Chrysanthemum
encourages her lord to do the sewing—most
of it, anyhow—and makes him think it a
sign of his superior wisdom. We’re cen-
turies too late to catch up to this smart
notion. And the ancient argument that re-
volves round the sewing-on of shirt-buttons,
still threatens to go on to eternity, like the
weatherbeaten question: “Hid Napoleon 111.
rouge his cheeks before the Battle of Sedan,
or-—didn’t he?” Zola said he did. What
say you, Arini?
Yours in doubt,
VANDORIAN.

SIX intensely interesting and
attractive Stories

R. Simms, Max Pemberton, W. Pett Ridge, Dick
Donovan, Fergus Hume, F. T. Bullen, each specially
written for this Annual; and, as usual, the tales will be

“GAMBLER’S GOLD.
By ARTHUR WRIGHT, Author of “A Rogue’s Luck,” etc.
With Four Full-page Illustrations.
Gamblers of all kinds have a place in this book —the card-player at the club,
the punter at the racecourse, and the larrikin at the two-up school. r lhe scenes
at the various places are depicted with the author’s usual power and. picturesque-
ness, the characters being splendidly drawn and the incidents thrilling in the
extreme. There is a description of a light worthy of Conan Doyle; a callous
murder for which an innocent man is blamed; a night at a two-up school as
vividly portrayed as on a cinematograph screen; and a welshing incident at the
racecourse. Side by side with all this there is a dramatic love story, which ends
happily.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, November 20, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie,—■
Society lias been far too busy with Cup
gaieties to worry about: the horrors of Social-.
Lsm. The Leaguers have been busy, as usual;
but thq house parties, with tea and a tame,
man politician laid on, have slumped
heavily.. By the way, one of the most rabid
dames in the Anti-Labor cause has had to
retire for a rest, owing- to her excess of zeal.
She was a healthy young matron when she
started to foil the Caucus, but she battled so
hard for Anti-Sosh, and argued so often with
Mariannes who objected to being left at
home with the children, that a nervous
breakdown resulted. The doctor gave her
a short space to live, if she persisted in over-
working and overworking as she was doing.
A distracted husband then led her off to a
peaceful spot, where she is taking things
easv and allowing the country to go to the
dogs.
Miss Quirk, the jolly little Irish girl who
is one of the .Denman house party, has. been
learning how to ride astride, and getting
some tumbles.in the process. She is quite at
home in the side-saddle, but desires to fhmili-
arise herself with the safer clothes-peg method
of staying on the roof of a horse. Many
Australian horsewomen have tried and
adopted the fashion. In one Victorian coun-
try town, recently, the girls of the district
met the bank clerks at polo, and beat them.
The Geebung Ladies’ Polo Club seems to be
a matter of the impending future.
There were no races at the opening of the
yachting season, on Saturday, the boats
merely indulging in evolutions far out in the
bay. The Bona did not spread her canvas
wings, as owner Charlie Wallace was away
mountaineering in the Buffaloes with his
bride. The Royal Club entertained in, the
clubhouse, and the Esplanade and pier were
thick with butterfly frocks and gay parasols.
Some, of the Melba co. came along to the
salt junketing. The present G.-G. is evi-
dently no lover of the waves. Dudley was
well salted and reckoned one of the boys by
yachtsmen; Northcote endowed the sport
with a cup, and Brassey—well, Brassey
never missed a chance to fall into the arms
of Neptune, so to speak. Denman, like the
Fuller Governor, seems to be a land sport
only.
Captain Clegg, the foreign warrior who is
to marry Miss Brett, has temporarily taken
the place of the disabled Denman as boss of
the polo team. Everard Browne, . the oppo-
sition captain, has a sporting missus—the
“Muffy” Chirnside of yore—who would
dearly love to take a hand in the game. A
lot of the recent enthusiasm for the sport
emanates from Major Quilter, the G.-G.'s
giant military secretary, who had years of it
in India. He is trying to infuse some' life
into a new club, and has visions of getting
a conveniently, situated ground. Kooyong
is too far out in one direction, and Moonee
Valley in another. Albert Park has possi-
bilities, but no dressing-room. The G.-G.
congratulates himself re those four polos
ponies lie snapped up in Bananaland. The
Australian-bred polo ponies that show form
are booked for India, as a rule.
While domesticated characters in general
are fleeing from large suburban houses, there
are still a few dauntless souls willing to build
private barracks, and chance their luck as
regards Marianne. The Chapmans are of
this valiant band. They have bought two
of land situated at the back of
St. Ivilda-road. The allotments are wedged
between Lanark (Charlie Wallace’s old
place, now owned by Rupert Clarke) and
Fifeshire, the mansion of the manufacturing
Brockhoffs. Both these houses stare across
the wide, green carpet of Albert Park. And
when the Chapmans’ house is built, it will
also stare —probably for the first flutter of a
maid’s cap. If the Chapmans are wise, they
will build the residence on a turntable, so
that it can turn away and rest its windows
when the search becomes hopeless.
The Rupert Clarke lady has brought a
Cinderella equipage from the Fog. It is
a motor, built mostly of plate-glass and
fitted up with interior electrics, so that
the most casual observer will miss no point
of the occupant’s toilet. The glittering
thing originally belonged to the Marquess of
Winchester, who sold it to Rupert. Pre-
sumably, the Marquess got tired of riding in a
glass house, and wanted to get out for a bit
and fling stones.
A Melbourne tobacconist now wears on
his front window, in brilliant gold letters 1
several inches high, the words, “Under the
patronage of the Due d’Abruzzi.” The al-
leged activity of the Duke afloat, and his
mild successes against the decrepit Turkish
fleet, have apparently given him some ad-,
vertising value.
Women bridge players don’t care to ask
more than three sister bridgers to sit round
the home card table, in case Marianne should
revolushe. But, as they cannot do without
an occasional bridge party, they give it at a
refreslimentery. The other afternoon, Mrs.
-T. H. Patterson gave a bridging, in the cool
spaciousness of the Winter Garden, and had
nice maids-in-waiting to pgss the tea and
cake. The Gaud Mayoress, with some im-
pressive plumes in her hat, was guest-in-
ehief; Mrs. Hugh Tr unable talked learnedly
of scores; Mrs. Railway Fitzpatrick had her
daughter along; and Mrs. Felstead and the
Widow Butler ran a dead heat in the con-
test for chiffon honors. Doctors’ wives were
numerous. Mrs. Maeansh led a bridge bri-
gade from Brighton, and Mrs. Mackeddie a
player or so from Collins-street. Everyone
went away, after happily losing two-and-
fiyepence-ha’penny, and reached home about
the time unruffled marianne was laying the
table for the evening meal.
Melbourne possesses a radical relation of
the peerage in the person of an unassuming
medico who practises in one of the suburbs,
lie is the son of an English lord, but objects
to being addressed as “the Honorable.”
Moreover, he does not intend to take up the
hereditary handle when his turn comes.
The reconciliatory goings-on of a married,
but quasi-separated pair are sufficiently un-
usual to be denounced as scandalous. After
getting a judicial separation, they departed
to opposite ends of the earth. Both re-
turned for the Cup, she staying at a big
hotel and he at his club. They send little
notes to each other,' and Mrs. Grundy, of the
Lounge, declares that there’ll be a re-union
soon if things are not looked into.
The north wind having taken down the:
shutters _ and started summer business,-
parties of bachelor girls are completing their
arrangements for summer camps. “Easy”!
chaperones are being hunted for, and camp
rules are being framed for the guidance of
all. One young woman nearly broke up a
meeting by announcing her intention of
forming one of a camp of two. As she
issued, at the same moment, several invita-
tions for her approaching wedding, Mrs.
Grundy was forced to subside. Most girls’
camps, strange to say, are pitched at an
easy distance from a camp of presentable
young men. Given plenty of moonlight and
evening concerts, tbe demand for Queen
Anne dove-cots should be brisk in the year
to come. The camp, the court and the villa.
Norman Bayles screwed on a galvanised
smile, last Thursday, and haunted the
Toorak polling booths in turn, using the
smallpox waggon (as his little yellow motor
has been christened) to rush round in. By
smiling desperately, he managed to get home
by a good majority. When returning thanks,
an interjector told him that he (the in-
ter jector) was in favor of the Government
policybut that he (Bayles) didn’t know
what it was. (Disorder.) Then a second
man, who also said he was a Government
supporter, congratulated Bayles on having
the courage to put forward opinions of a
very- high order of antiquity. (Laughter
and disorder.)
Although ex-Police Magistrate Panton can
now scarcely see, he takes life cheerfully.
At the Government House garden party, the
veteran, smart and trim as of yore, was
piloted about the lawn by his younger
daughter.
Freda Sternberg, who has done some not-
able bacteriological work in Melbourne, is
off to Sydney to yard up germs there.
The invitations for the Landale-Clarke
wedding, at Rupertswood, on December §,
have fled ‘through the post. Said that the
Frank Clarkes will step into Salisbury,
South Yarra, when the bride leaves it for
her new home.
Miss Findlay, daughter of the Beaumaris
Findlays, was wedded t’other Tuesday to tea-
merchant Jones, of Sydney, by Dr. Marshall.
Afterwards, a big party petrolled round to
the Grand for refreshments and speeches.
The bride, who has bright blue eyes, had a
bright blue motor to go away in.
Pauline Toohey, one of a tribe of Irish-
Australian sisters, well known in suburban
society, was married in Dublin, the other
day, to Mr. Osborne Spencer Baker, who is
secretary to some elevated political peer.
The doves subsequently fluttered to Paris
for a trip.
Ann Williams, the tall Melbourne girl who
is singing small parts with the Melba Opera
Co., was the principal soprano at Scots’
Church for some time. Melba picked her out
from a class at the Conservatorium during
her last visit here, and has kept her eye on
her ever since. From the kirk to the foot-
lights is a far cry, but the dramatic quality
of Ann’s soprano has carried her all the
way. For that matter, the voice and musical
education of many a church choir boy has
doomed him to a comic-opera career.
Lizzie Newbold, just back from Europe, is
to reintroduce her warble to Melbourne hear-
ing at the Masonic Hall three nights in the
first-week of December. Miss Newbold was
a soprano for whom Melba predicted a great
future. On the strength of the Melba patron-
age, the damsel was “floated” by a committee,
which sent hqr to the Marchesi school in
Paris for training. She contracted with her
committee to return in three years, and give
some concerts. If the voice has trained up
to expectations, the three concerts will pre-
sumably be extended into an Australian tour.
Alice Crawford, the most commanding-
figure among Australian actresses in the
Cold Country, is shortly to take the road
that leads to the altar. Alice’s prospective
husband is George Valentine Williams, who
scribbles Parisian news for London Times.
Paderewski, pawing sonatas out of his
concert grand, had an inspiration, the other
day, and hurried away to jot it down. Then
lie fired it out by mail to John Lemmone. It
was a request for a setting—of Australian
duck eggs! In the intervals of grand-
opera business, imninione is composing the
consignment.
The Scotchbyterian Ladies’ College held a
congress last week, but Melba didn't go
along, though she was one of four honorary
members of the president’s committee. Dur-
ing a former visit, she looked up the school
of her turbulent youth, and sat on the plat-
form with a mischievous twinkle in her eye
while the whole place kow-towed.
* Tenor M'Cormack, his wife and two little
M’Gormacks, avoid the crowded life of city
taverns by inhabiting a hired house in
Toorak, and keeping a gas engine for trans-
port. Southwell, of Sydney, spent Cup week
with the quartette, and took part in the
morning hunt for the election ammunition
laid by the family hens. M‘Cormack and
Burke, who are both getting stout, brought
a professional puncher from Sydney to keep
their figures in order. But, apparently, they
haven’t been putting the biff artist to great
exertion, for they are still getting stout.
Hal Elvins, who smote many pianos under
Oonservatorium tutorage in Melbourne, has
been hauling his music case great distances.
He recently toured Norway, and penetrated
to the places where the sun sometimes stays
out all night, and doesn’t even close the bar
at 11. The music lovers of those dim regions
are said to have vigorously applauded the
young Southerner’s work. He will be in
Melbourne again in the early part of 1912.
A concert, to which some of the friliest
society song-birds contributed, was given re-
cently in the old council chamber of the
Town Hall. The affair was in aid of the
Bush Nursing Fund, and Gaud Mayoress
Davey was chief organiser, with Mrs.
Staughton a good second. Mrs. Norman
Brookes, in a bridal white dress of chiffon
and silver, and with nodding blue plumes in
her hat, lifted up her voice for the- cause.
Beatrice Madden, who owns a sweet warble,
was another important decoration of the pro-
gramme. Tenor Kirby added a few liquid
notes. Beryl McAdam sawed at her violin,
and Florrie Finn recited. Mrs. Stuart
Murray, who failed to appear at her part of
the programme,. was explained away. (This
sounds like a high-grade conjuring trick, but
it was done.) The performers and their
friends afterwards took tea with the Gaud
Mayoress, in her beautiful, blue-and-gold
decorated rooms. The Best knight drew the
raffle for the earrings and the ring. The
finger bauble went to a woman and the ear
decorations to a man.
“Rosua” sends some notes from London:
Clytie Hine, the Adelaide soprano, has scored four
engagements for the opera season at Covent Garden,
and is also understudying a part in “Bonita ” the
new musical comedy at the Queen’s. She played
“Freia”. at the opening of the Wagner Festival,
hers being one of only four English names in the
cast.
Fiddler Willie Cade and .’cellist Elford Mack are
flatting together in the Fog, and hard at work.
After a year’s study in Berlin, Mr. Cade went tour-
ing with the Beecham Opera Co., through these
chill islands. Now he is first fiddler with “The
Chocolate Soldier” Co. at the Lyric. Mr. Mack is
’celling at Wyridbam’s Theatre. They are very-
home-sick Australians.
Will Dyson’s name figures among “prominent ar-
tists” advertised as illustrators of “London Stories,”
a book that is being issued in 25 weekly parts.
Louise Mack’s latest yarn, “The Music-Makers,” is
being published serially in the Daily Mirror.
Peter Dawson, of Adelaide, looking a stouter- and
more imposing basso, is making the Queen’s, Hall
quiver at the Chappel Ballad Concerts, on Saturdays,
and at the orchestral outbursts, at the same barn,
during the week.
Muriel Matters, the Adelaide suffragette girl, who
hurt the House of Commons’s feeling once upon a
time, has been caravanning through England.: She
has taken to Christian Science and slum working, and
has been offering to lecture the world on various deep
topics.
The J. C. Williamsons have gone on to the
Continent, and intend motoring over the face of
Europe, from now till they leave for Australia, early
next year.
Ada Crossley Muecke has lent her house for the
knotting of Ruby Seddon and Staff-Surgeon Sam
Woods, R.N. The skirmish is to happen, or did
happen, or was to have happened, on November 4.
As this was, and is, and will be written on October
19, I can’t be more explicit. The event is to occur
the yesterday be{pre the day after to-morrow, so to
speak.
Actress worship is occasionally hard on
the flappers who practise it. A kindly
bachelor uncle of Melbourne, having dined
satisfactorily, offered to shout the young-
people of the house to a theatre. Two girls
sadly but firmly refused the invitation, and
a puzzled uncle asked “Why?” He was
told that the pair were bound by a solemn
vow not to enter a theatre again until Lily
Brayton returned. They were not stage-
struck —merely Brayton-bitten.
One of Melbourne’s veteran tailors, whose
slim, tall figure and jaunty manner are quite
out of keeping with his historical reminis-
cences, describes the Gup of nowadays as a
prim, prosaic ghost of its old self. He looks
back at the sartorial lunacies of the carnival
in the late ’7o’s and early ’Bo’s, and sees
astounding visions. The reminiscencer
instances a dandy for whom he built
a frock suit of cream-colored satin,
the shimmering coat, vest and pants being-
matched with a tall hat of the same mat-
erial. Whether his client wore boots to
match, the tailor is not certain. He made
the tall hat, but had nothing to do with the
dsndy’s footgear. But he remembers a
white-shod bushman—an explorer by pro-
fession —who came from up-country with
£BO to spend on Cup rejoicings, and gave an
order for an amazing suit of white sateen
trimmed with silk braid and fancy buttons.
In this glorious outfit he strolled about the
lawn,, a pair of flaming red whiskers protrud-
ing from his lobster-tinted face. Sighting
the tailor who had adorned him, the explorer
hitched on to that awe-struck artist, and
wouldn’t be shaken off. They walked the
lawn together—poor Frankenstein and the
white-sateened Monster whom he had cre-
ated ! Before the week was out the Monster
had exhausted his £BO, so he borrowed £5
from the tailor, who lives to tell the tale,
and he went back to the wilds, and was seen
in Melbourne no more.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The dressing in the members’ stand at the Oval
on Saturday was as scrumptious as anything in the
recollection of the oldest cricketing enthusiast or
nuisance. Having unburdened himself of a whole
tankful of cricket reminiscences, ranging from the
visit of the first English team to Australia half a
century ago, down to the days when Giffen was in
flower, so to speak, an Old Oval Identity of my
acquaintance made an abrupt plunge into veracity.
“Well,” said he, “even if our boys can’t bowl, the
Kiris can dress, and that evens things up.” A great
and gratifying truth in its way. Lady Bosanquet
turned up to watch the Downfall, both on Friday
ana Saturday, and Mr. and Mrs. H. B. Irving mater-
ialised op the second day, in white and brown respec-
tively.
If) file evening, the Irvings showed us how mail-
bags were robbed in the bellowdramatie epoch. The
show was witnessed by an impressive viceregal
party, comprising two (Governors and their wives, anti
a whole flack of garish Helps. By the way, the
Inch, contaminated by the example of Melbourne
and Sydney, are forsaking the till-lately-patronised
dress circle for the stalls. Our stalls have half the
comfort, and three times the dust, of the circle seats.
But the members of our old nobility don’t care,
they are Sacrificing themst.*Ves—-though perhaps
unknowingly—on the altar of a great cause. One
*" le ln arks of provincialism, as regards towns, is
i 6 of the stalls in the leading theatres,
by dusty folk, in the clothes they have been wearing
at toil, during the day. The clustering of the over-
fed and -dressed in the vicinity of the conductor's
back hair is one of the first dim signs that the r.lace
where it occurs is developing into a Metropolis.
An echo of the Walratah comes -in the lodging of
the late Colonel Browne’s estate for probate. His
Victorian and English possessions are valued at
£105,000, and he owned a large slice Of good pas-
toral country in this State.
Ruthven Mansions, the new flats, are being rushed
—one of the reasons being the deplorable scarcity of
Mariannes, competent or otherwise. The Barritts.
Bonneys and K.vffit) Thomases are among the
rushers. The Keith Bowmans—just returned from
England—have a flat of their own, atop of Bowan’s
Arcade, a building venture in King William-street in
which they have sunk a good many golden sover-
eigns. ’’
The exodus to the hills has begun. The Walter
Bagots and Waterhouses have departed, as have the
Teasdale Smiths. It’s an everlasting mystery why
people who own “country residences” don’t get to
them sooner. The hills are a veritable glory in
September and October.
A. Baker Clack has had two pictures hung in this
year’s Paris Salon, and has had his praises sounded
by the French preSs. He’s a South Australian, so
we duly share the pride of Mr. James Ashton (his
old master) in his success.
Mount Lofty Flower Show occurred on Saturday
last. Rhododendrons! took top place—but roses, sweet
pea and irises ran them very close. The locality is full
of earnest gardeners, people, who would liefer play a
hose on a lawn that golf on a links, and who prefer
slaying aphides to any other game. Professor Stir-
ling, for example, lias a garden which includes up-
wards of 70 varieties of rhododendrons. As usual,
he scooped the pool in this class. The Hawkers,
Bagots and Waterhouses were to the fore in other
classes. As a rule, Lady Bosanquet declares the
Show well and truly open, but she was otherwise
engaged (as abovementioned) on Saturday, and so
Mrs. Stirling did the deed!
Our “Hospital Trouble” looks as if it might de-
velop into just such , a flare-up as brought Drs. Ram-
say Smith and Napier here, 1 years ago. On one
side are 80 nurses, with a good firm of lawyers at
their back, and, on the other, a charge nurse and
the Board. The 80 refuse to work with the charge
nurse—and the Board says thfly(ve no right to refuse
anything, so long as they’re in the hospital’s emplov.
From a mass of rumor, in. which “strike,” “suspen-
sion,” “dismissal” and “tacfiessngss” are the most
frequently recurring nouns, it* is hard to get at facts,
wherefore the Government is going to hold the usual
old inquiry. f
Talking of hospitals, the Echunga-road seems an
ill-fated spot for the Porters of Gilberton. It is
not long since Mrs. Charlie Jessop (who was a Miss
Porter) came to grief there', in a motor smash, and
now Professor Angas (who married a Miss Porter)
has had a similar spill.
In the same way, the crew of the barque Margit
will probably avoid Victor Harbor in future. A few
days before the vessel left, the captain (Petersen)
mysteriously vanished, and no trace of him has
been found, though the boat which he used was dis-
covered bottom up on the beach, some eight miles
away. Then the barque left, only to get mixed up
with a quicksand on the Coorong. The sleepy towns
along the south coa«t awoke with amazing celer ; tv
and got to work with rockets and lifeboats. The
crew got safelv ashore, and had a journey of scant
joy over sandhills, and through scrub, to where
hospitality awaited them, but the vessel is fast van-
ishing.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

ONCE AGAIN THE
TONIC TREATMENT
Another Severe Case of Indi-
gestion Cured*
Again the tonic treatment has been suc-
cessful in .curing severe Indigestion. Mrs.
E. Smith, of Stagpole Street, West End,
Townsville, reports that she has recovered
from a bad atack of Indigestion. The tonic
treatment is surely the simplest and sanest
for the complaint. Indigestion occurs when
the stomach becomes too weak to digest
food, and the tonic treatment aims at re-
storing strength to the. digestive organs. In
all the cases where the newspapers have re-
corded remarkable cures of Indigestion the
tonic taken has been Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. They have been, found to have excel-
lent results in even the severest cases, as
this cure shows.
“I enjoyed good health till about two
years since, when I began to suffer from In-
digestion,” said Mrs. Smith. ‘‘l suffered
much from acid and flatulence and pain in
the stomach, especially after eating. I felt a
great oppression about my heart. I fo ’ f
much difficulty in breathing, especially when
lying down, and frequently had to get up
out of bed and go outside so as to catch my
breath. I felt a great weight at the pit of
my stomach. I gradually lost my appetite,
and became very thin. I had a smothering
feeling about my heart, and my stomach
used to swell to a great extent at times. I
used to feel quite giddy in my head, and I
suffered much from want of sleep. No mat-
ter what kind of food I ate it always dis-
agreed with me. I had been suffering
agonies for about 12 months, when I read a
testimonial in the Townsville Bulletin of
a cure performed by Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. The case described was very much
like my own, so I decided on giving them a
trial, and bought a box, and started taking
them, one after each meal. The first box
did not do me much good ; but during the
time I was taking the second box I found a
wonderful improvement. I continued the
use of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills till I found
myself thoroughly restored to good health
again. I am now as strong and healthy as
I ever was, and atribute my cure solely to
the use of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are 2s. 9d. a box,

POLITICAL
POINTS
N.S.W. Attorney-General Holman tore a
rather blotted leaf out of Wade’s book when
he refused to explain why he released Dixon
of Lithgow, but assured his opponents that
if they knew the circumstances they would
be so ashamed of their attitude in the matter
that they would wither up. Wade had quite
a habit of hinting, in a dark, piratical
fashion, that he was keeping something horri-
ble locked up in his own breast, and that his
opponent had better not drive him to let the
fearsome thing loose, for if he did, he (the
opponent) would be so overwhelmed with
disgrace that he would flee out of public life
in two leaps. It was amusing at first, but
it grew very, very stale.
THE DISAPPOINTED SIREN.
The Federal Government has only to be squeezed
a little, and it will retreat from any position which
seems to give this State : an advantage.—S. M.
Herald, rather recklessly.
THE FEDERAL COP (with sudden firmness):
“Away, woman! My duty is on my
beat! ”
HIS EXACTING FRIEND : “ Wot! Th' bloomin’
worm dares to turn, an ’ refuses to heed
me! Which shows that some other
shameless, unprincipled hussy down th'
street must 'ave ’im on a string now!”
Thus Willie Watt, at Essendon, just be-
fore the Victorian elections :
The Government, this year, has added £43,000 to
the pay of the female teachers, who hitherto have
not had votes.
The plain man would say that this master-
piece of ingenuousness smelled somewhat of
political bribery; but an honest cove like
Murray is, of course, incapable of anything-
like that.
REGAINING BEAUTY OF SHAPE.
Over-fatness is one of the greatest enemies
to beauty, and to vitality as well, and
the question as to what is really the best and
safest means of reducing weight and recov-
ing a slender shape is one of great import-
ance, as health as well as harmony of pro-
portion has to be considered. Undoubtedly,
experience proves the most efficacious remedy
to be Marmola Prescription Tablets, no less
famed than the original Marmola Prescrip-
tion, but much more convenient in
this condensed form. Regaining beauty of
shape does not mean starving the body into
thinness, as many treatments do; it means
getting rid of all the superfluous fat deposits
and at the same time so strengthening the
muscular system that the parts will assume
beauty of contour and harmony of propor-
tion from head to foot. This is what Mar-
xnola Prescription Tablets do, because they
promote appetite and sound digestive pow-
ers, so that muscle and nerve tissue are daily
reinforced by excellent food. True beauty
means health and strength as well as beauty
of form. Dose: one tablet after each meal
and one at night. Marmola Prescription
Tablets are sold by chemists, price 3s. 6d.,
or, post free, of the Marmola Company, 5
and 7 Barrack Street, Sydney, N.S.W.*
NOTE. —For those who prefer the liquid
preparation, chemists are still dispensing the
famous prescription as follows : One ounce of
fluid Extract of Glycyrrhiza B.P., one ounce
of pure Glycerine B.P., one half-ounce of
Marmola, and mix with peppermint water to
make six ounces in all. The dose is two
teaspoonfuls after each meal.
In Parliament, the other day: —
Mr. John Forrest was pleased to note that the
Labor party was standing shoulder to shoulder with
others in the community in the matter of defence.
Mr. Kelly (N.S.W.) : It would be unpopular to do
anything else at the present time.
The humorous impudence of the above lies
in the fact that, as recently as the Dread-
nought fiasco, John Forrest and Willy Kelly
were among the bitterest assailants of an
Australian Navy (they spoke of it gibingly
as “the proposed mosquito fleet,” and con-
tended that the North Sea was the region
where the Commonwealth’s fate would be
decided) ; and they damned universal ser-
vice (“conscription”) for all they were
worth. Of course, “Liberalism” is bound to
claim, ultimately, that it was responsible for
Australian defence. But the time is not yet
ripe. The public hasn’t had long enough to
forget.
The postal votes at the Bootliby (S.A.) |
election numbered 332 —51 for Labor and ;
281 for the Tory candidate. The postal
vote is not secret in the same sense as the
ballot. It is the only kind of vote that can
be bought by bribes or acquired by threats, •
with any assurance that the goods will be j
delivered. And even when the ballot is over- j
whelmingly Labor, the postal vote is always in :
the main Tory. Its abolition is due to the
fact that the business has been overdone.
Some people never know when to stop.
There have been three stages in the Italia-
Tripolitan scrap: (1) The newspaper cor-
respondents were on the spot, but were not
allowed to send any news save such as the
Italian authorities approved of, consequently
the world heard that the Italians were win-
ning. (2)The correspondents left in disgust,
and sent all news up to date from Malta,
and the world heard that the Italians were
having a dreadfully poor time. (3) The cor-
respondents being away, the Italians started
winning again. In the last battle the news
read that the Turks and Arabs lost heavily,
while the Dagoes had one man wounded.
Which vaguely recalls the American lie
about the despatch said to have been for-
warded by a Russian general after Omar
Pasha had chased him about 30 miles: “The
enemy lost 10,000 killed and wounded. We
had two births.”
Heedless of the lesson taught
by Melbourne’s gas monopoly, the
suburban councils one after an-
other are fooling away their
chances of getting a cheap and
satisfactory supply of electric
light and power, when the Greater
Melbourne Council arrives. The
latest to grant a private co. au-
thority to bog into the business is
Moorab'bin, which indues Sand-
ringham, Cheltenham, Hampton,
Bentleigh and other villages. It
does the deed on the usual fool
plea that Private Enterprise can
do the thing cheaper. Even if the
council hadn’t brains or energy
enough to put up its own supply
works, it could have carried a sup-
ply per wire from the Melbourne
Council, or even have hired it in
a temporary way from a private
company. The one that got the
concession, and thus becomes a
fixture on the premises, is bring-
ing the fluid all the way from
Richmond.
Stated in cold, official figures, the manu-
facturing business was worth £48,048,032 to
Australia in 1910. It is only in a phenom-
enal year that the agricultural production
comes within yelling distance of that, and, in
average seasons, the backbone of the country
is a mere rib by comparison. Even in 1909-
10, which was an exceptional year, the total
of the alleged backbone’s output didn’t run
higher than £41,056,000. And the agricul-
tural production isn’t all “added value,”
anyhow. Manufactures are only credited
with the difference between the value of the
material put in and of the goods taken out,
whereas the whole gross value of the agricul-
tural output is included in these statistics,
without any deduction on account of seed-
wheat or fertilisers, or a few other trifles.
Thus, even statistics glorify the backbone
more than he deserves, at the expense of the
country’s manufactures.
In the course of the scuffle, or dog-howl,
organised by Joseph Cook in the Represen-
tatives, re the site of the Naval College,
Colonel Ryrie, of N.S.W., declared that Jer-
vis Bay was really “in the wilds.” It is a
lamentable prospect for a State with 310,000
square miles of country to look after —most
of it still to be settled —when it gets into the
habit of depending on the purely George-
street type of legislator who thinks that be-
cause a place is 87 miles from Sydney, it is
right out in the tangled and untrodden wil-
derness.
A quarter of a century ago, the N.S.W.
Parliament bumped against the same trouble
that stopped the McGowen Government, last
week, after the House had declared
that the heroic Wade had grossly
libelled it. It was then Dibbs who was
stopped from rapping Parkes over the head.
Parkes, while out of Parliament, had written
a letter to the Herald accusing the House, of
squandering money to suit the private in-
terests of members; and as soon as Parkes
got a seat, Dibbs moved that the letter was
a gross libel on the House. The motion was
carried. Thereupon, the cunning old man
shook his mane and said: “Well, go ahead.”
Dibbs took counsel, and would do nothing.
But Copeland jumped in with a motion for
Parkes’s expulsion. Dibbs, however, whis-
pered something into Copeland’s ear, and he
proposed to withdraw the motion. Somebody
yelled “Object!” so there had to be a divi-
sion ; but only two members said “Aye.”
Then the matter dropped dead.
Great Britain has Payment of Members
now, and it has, also, here and there, the
noble-souled member who declares that it is
against his principles to take the money.
That kind was fairly numerous when the
first cheque came along, but the second one
found him much less copious, and his fre-
quency is diminishing so fast that it is feared
there will soon be hardly enough abundance
about him to make his plentifulness worth
consideration.
The Federal trawler Endeavor, now
searching, in conjunction with the survey
ship Fantome, for the submerged derelict
bumped byithe P. and O. Co.’s India, while cross-
ing the Bight, is engaged on necessary work ;
but it isn’t the sort of toil it w r as acquired
for. The Commonwealth will have to get a
vessel for such jobs in the near future. The
abandoned timber scow Whangahape may
still be washing about the Tasman Sea in
the track of the M.L. boats. No attempt has
yet been made to locate and destroy it; but
if one of the steamers gets a violent kick in
the waistcoat some dark night, its name may
occur to people. A derelict is a thing to be
pursued with gun cotton just as soon as it is
reported.
HIS PROFOUND CALM.
The Minister for Customs, in reply to Mr.
Lyne ’ (N.S.W.), said the question of dealing with
tariff anomalies this session depended upon the pro-
gress of the business at present before the House.
He had received 100 replies to his circulars to manu-
facturers on the subject.
Australia : “Come quickly, doctor, there are
some bad cases of low tariff down here.
Prompt attention might save them.”
The Medico: “ Yes, very well. One of these
days when I am not so busy Pll have a
look in if I can make it convenient .”
Since the strenuous advocacy of the
Postal Vote by “Liberals” in the alleged in-
terest of the “sick and afflicted,” it is be-
coming known as the bed-postal vote.
The brightest item of Vic. Labor party
tactics in the recent “electoral campaign”
vvas the choosing of Duke to carry its banner
at Toorak. With Norman Bayles standing
for Toryism, and all the capitalistic virtues,
and one Cornwall posing as a Liberal-Social-
ist supporter of the Weary Government,
there was nothing for Labor but to appeal to
the choicest Toorakian feelings with a Duke.
It is believed that several of the very best
people in the electorate accepted Duke as a
nobly-born candidate, and voted accordingly.
During 1910, 39 contract immigrants were
admitted into the Commonwealth, of whom
38 were British and one French. Eight of
them went to Lithgow (N.S.W.), six to
Mackay (Q.), five to Melbourne, and the
1 rest were split up. None were refused ad-
mission. Of the immigrants not under con-
tract, 42 were' declined without thanks.
Thirty-two were Chinese, five British, two
Japanese, one Hindu, one Malay, and one
Syrian. Eleven of the lot were stowaways.
One glad feature of the returns for the year
was that 4082 discolored persons, etc., de-
parted from Australia. Of these, 2300 were
Chows, 548 Papuans, 462 Japs, 261 Malays,
229 Hindus and Cingalese, 54 Pacific Is-
landers, 27 Syrians, 25 Afghans, 19 Javan-
ese, and there were 80 others. The Lord
knoweth what the others were! Anyhow,
three cheers!
Extract from the Argus report of an elec-
tioneering speech by Deakin in the House
of Reps.:—
Mr. Deakin: Ours is a double-barrelled complaint.
We want more people and a readjustment of the
tariff.
Mr. Webster (N.S.W.) : Do you include your deputy
leader when you say “we”? (Ministerial laughter.)
Mr. Roberts: Are you speaking for Mr. Cook and
Mr. Fuller and the rest of them? (Renewed Minis-
terial laughter.)
Mr. Deakin: Yes, I am speaking for the whole of
the Opposition. (Cheers.)
So, either “the whole of the Opposition”—
including Joke Cook and Fuller —have been
converted to the curse of Protection, or else
they are prepared to fasten the curse on to
the country rather than go hungry any
longer themselves. Meantime, they and their
press barrackers talk of the awful sacrifices
of principle which the Laborites are pre-
pared to make in order to get and keep
power.
A WORD TO TRAVELLERS.
The excitement incidental to travelling and change
of water and food often brings on diarrhoea, colic
and pain in the stomach, and for this reason no one
should leave home without a bottle of Chamber-
lain’s Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy. It can
always be depended upon to effect a quick cure. It
cannot be procured when on board train or steamer,
and that is when it is most likely to be needed, and
for this reason should always be procured before
leaving home.*
Times are' changing: Bonar Law, the new
leader of the British Tory party, vice Bal-
four, isn’t either a peer or the nephew of a
peer; isn’t even an Oxford man. He is
merely a retired iron merchant, aged 53.
Maoriland, which says Australia might be
an orright place to live in if it weren t for
droughts, has just allocated £30,000 from
its Public Works Fund to irrigate parts of
Central Otago, where only Scotchmen can
settle owing to the necessity of drinking the
whisky raw.
The Earl of Lonsdale, an irresponsible
person who sometimes serves as a mouthpiece
for his professed friend, Kaiser William, has
rushed into publicity with the announcement
that William’s son, the Crown Prince of
Germany, is intensely friendly to Great
Britain. German newspapers blame the
young man for having made a display of
anti-British feeling in the Reichstag, but
Lonsdale is prepared to swear that it was
unintentional. Evidently, the Crown Prince
has at one time or other slapped the imble
Lonsdale on the back, whilst father W illiam
was pulling his leg, and the noble Lonsdale
mistook himself for the British Empire.
“8.J.H.0.” : The Victorian elections closed
another phase in the tragic career of W. A.
Trenwith. He was defeated last week, by
over 1000 votes, by a comparative nonen-
ity for Gippsland North. Trenwith did
well when the Argus tore at his throat.
Latterly, the Tory press has become his
friend. And one result is that he cannot
even gain a place among the pvgmies of
the Viction Legislative Ass. The art of
becoming an ex-Democrat gracefully and con-
vincingly is a rare one. Trenwith lacks it
to a painful extent.
Perry, M.L.A., he who recently described
himself as being greatly damnified, has won
the first trick in his action against Speaker
Willis, the N.S.W. Full Court holding that,
if any member of Parliament hurl a water-
bottle (say) at the Speaker, and manages to
escape out of the Chamber, the hurler cannot
legally be brought back to be dealt with.
So, in future, the Speaker will apparently
have to (1) dodge the missiles heaved at
him; (2) keep a supply of blue metal or
dead marines handy, and get in first wallop;
or (3) pursue the assaulting party and bash
him ad lit. upon capture. It is a precarious
outlook for the Speaker, whichever course he
adopts, unless he carries on his job in a suit
of armor. Even then, an enraged Tory,
despoiled of office, might place an infernal
machine under the chair, and, by means of a
fuse laid from the refreshment room, blow
the presiding officer through the roof of his
helmet.
NEGLECTED FAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
That there is great danger in neglected fat, every
authority admits. — Prelude to anti-fat advt.
Now, who has neglected Fat?
Who has left him alone to stew?
Who has mocked at his shining hat,
And failed to give him his due
With a bonus of cent per cent?
Lo ! I wait for the swift reply!
A wond’ring pause and the welkin’s vent
With the whole world’s yell, “NOT I! !”
Who ever neglected Fat?
Who has failed to shoulder his load?
An idiot’s question that!
Let’s push Lean out of his road!
Lean may be neglected, but
’Tis the lot of his genus flat.
And Lean is Fat’s faithful slave !. ..
Tut, tut!
Who ever neglected Fat?

Morse’s Indian Root Pills, as 1 tho ugitthat
they were doing me a lot of good. They had
a tendency at first to create a feeling of sick-

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Sportsmen, please note: The monster
benefit in aid of the widows and orphans of the lost
steamers Rosedale and Macleay takes place at the
Mclnstoush Stadium, Sydney, on the evening of
Monday next, the 27th. A varied programme in-
cludes items like Sam Langford boxing Dave Smith,
after which Clabby will try conclusions with Porky
Flynn.
About the toughest figtht Sam Langford
has ever had was the 10-round affair put up with
Joe Jeannette, at Madison Square, A.G., in New
York, a few weeks before he Started for Australia.
He had undertaken to knock out Jeannette within
the time, and, when his chances began to fade, he put
up a series of the most savage attacks ever seen
in New York. Jeannette met them with long, sud-
den jolts from a straight left that spoiled Lang-
ford’s beauty absolutely, and more or less demoral-
ised him. in the early stages of the disturbance it
looked as though Jeannette might go at any moment.
He went down in the first round, and staggered up
only to be saved by the gong. In the clinches
Langford got home with short-arm hooks and upper-
cuts with both hands, and it appeared that Jeannette
was going to be pounded to ruins in short order.
But, in the fifth round, Langford became aware that
his antagonist was getting home swings on the
jaw that were causing the lights to flicker somewhat.
Being as black as a new, fashionable hat, Langford’s
face didn’t show his injuries to any extent, but when
he went to his corner it was noticed that the dilapi-
dations were considerable. In the seventh he stopped
a couple that made him literally dance with fury,
and he bounded round the ring wildly till his head
got clear. Altogether, Jeannette was down three
times during the encounter, but, although he lost the
decision, given in these 10-round mills by acclama-
tion, he had avoided the promised knock-out, and
smashed up his formidable rival very badly indeed.
In fact, he had burst up Langford’s mana, and the
day after the scrap with Jeannette, the fighting
scribes decided solemnly that Langford had no hope
against Johnson. And, of course, they are the men
who know all about it.
Langford was bitterly chagrined at his failure,
and hastened to give details of an alleged attempt
at doping. It had leaked out during the fight that a
lot of “wise money” had been laid on Jeannette
during the last rounds of the scrap, although Lang-
ford was then fighting with the fury and speed of
17 devils. And people asked angrily, “Whaffor?”
Langford’s tale was that, the morning of the fight,
nearly everyone who had breakfast at the training
camp" table was taken violently ill. He himself got
off rather lightly, but some of the others were too ill
to attend the scrap. An old-time pug had visited
the training camp to see the fighters the evening be-
fore, but had confined all his attentions to the cook.
And there the yarn ends.
However, wild and savage as was the Langford-
Jeannette disturbance, it paled into insignificance
compared to the Flynn-Carl Morris unpleasantness.
Carl Morris was on the top of the heap as the rising
Hope, and Flynn was a new-comer, who was sort of
being given a show to demonstrate how he could
take a licking. But when they got into the ring it
was found that Morris was hog-fat. The audience
snorted, and regarded Flynn as “a lemon” of the
first water, * when Morris could afford to come into
the ring in that condition. Before entering the ring
Flynn had been a fireman at Pueblo, and much
swinging of the coal shovel and stirring of the slicer
had made him unusually strong in arm and shoulder.
Morris, on the other hand, though vast of frame and
towering over his smaller antagonist, had, in propor-
tion, much less shoulder development, and his arms
were described as being “poorly muscled.” When
they got to work, the lean, wiry Flynn promptly
smote Morris’s left eye. Then he smote his mouth.
Next he smote his nose for a change. The rest of
the story was raw meat and blood and tedious repe-
tition. The lurid descriptions froze the marrow of
the Governor of the State at breakfast next morning,
so that he arose and talked hurriedly of a repeal of
the Frawley Act, which countenances boxing. But
it was all ‘flam. All that was required was police
supervision to stop the fight when it began to show
signs of degenerating into a carnival of brutality.
Flynn won on points, but he had no more hope of
scoring a knock-out off Morris than he had off the
Flat Iron building, just round the corner. When he
entered the ring Morris was beautiful to see, stand-
ing 6ft. 4in. in his fighting shoes, tipping the beam
at 222 pounds, with long arms that stretched 79|m.
from tip to tip. Alongside this beautiful specimen
of humanity the Pueblo fireman looked a pigmy, and
beastly commonplace. But Morris was fat, and Fat
is the devil.
“Snell” : The difficulties promoters experi-
ence in getting a brace of biff mechanics into the
ring in Melbourne must be extreme, otherwise there
would surely have been no resort to the scrap-heap,
as happened when ancient Dan Creedon and that dis-
colored Methuselah, Starlight, were put on as a race-
time excitement. Starlight, who does not gaze on
the alcoholic refresher, 'nn still put up an antic
spar; but Daniel Creedon is fat and old. It took
him one minute' to get going, and 12secs. to regret
it. Then he spread himself on the pine flooring, and
positively declined to awake. At the express desire
of the audience,' his share of the purse was awarded
to the dusky gladiator. The promoters should now
match the Benevolent Asylum champion against the
next patriarchal exhibit in the Old Actors Home.
Jimmy Clabby, from America, and Arthur
Cripps, from the Dim and Distant Past, en-
countered each other at the Sydney Stadium on Sat-
urday night, under the management of the Mclntosh
and the distinguished patronage of a large number ot
bottle-obs. Union Club members, etc. After careful
consideration of all the circumstances, The Bulletin
heartily decides that an injunction should be moved
for to prevent Cripps, Bilsquires, Bilang, and other
has-beens or hasn’t-beens, from wasting the public s
valuable time. Clabby’s weight was announced at
list.; Cripps declined to weigh, there being nothing
in the articles calling upon him to do so. As a pre-
liminary, the police adopted the unusual course of
warning the men from the ring-side against what
has come to be known as in-fighting, but which is an
adaptation of jid-jitsu. No doubt, Clabby was the
man whom the warning was particularly sought to
impress, but it was unnecessary, owing to the way
Cripps grabbed his opponent’s arms and gloves on
every possible occasion, and hung on till, at times, it
seemed that nothing short of a cold chisel would
detach him. Referee Baker seems to be suffering
from an over-supply of good nature lately, and ad-
vantage is being taken of it to an extent which is
likely to make the contests he controls unattractive.
Cuddling is not boxing; and the spectacle of a high-
class referee perspiring from repeated struggles to
drag one contestant from the till-beath-do-us-part em-
brace of the other, is absurd. There was very little
else in the fight that calls for special mention.
Clabby plugged away at Cripps’s ribs and other body
accessories until the fourteenth round, when the Aus-
tralian old-timer heaved the napery in the direction
of Mars. It was remarkable that he did so well.
The American took things fairly easy throughout,
but he showed nothing to indicate that he has im-
proved his boxing since his last season in Australia.
“0.K.” : Coming to Melbourne with the
reputation of having beaten S.A. at every point of
the game, and won the match by an innings and
194 runs, the English cricket team made a weak
first impression. True, it was only half the
Same team —Warner, Gunn, Vine, Barnes and Strud-
wick, had been replaced by Kinneir, Hearne, Smith
(wicket-keeper), Hitch and Iremonger; but these
were supposed to be almost as strong in the aggre-
gate as the other quintette, except that Barnes, who
is, perhaps, the most trustworthy bowler of the
crowd, was standing out. At any rate, England,
with first use of the wicket, was reasonably expected
to make an immediate show of superiority. After
two days play things looked rather otherwise. The
batting of the visitors for four hours on the Friday
—after Hobbs had been dismissed for a lively 21—
was neither nervous nor confident, feeble nor sturdy,
timid nor reckless. It was just dull. It made the
bowling look difficult, whilst the field appeared to
be remarkably well placed. Late in the afternoon
F. R. Foster started to hit, and rapidly raised his
score from 40 to 101, before getting out. For a
time he was the one redeeming feature of a horribly
slow performance—a feature that would have been
obliterated early in the game if Macrow had not
dropped a catch. And even with Foster’s spasm of
brisk hitting, the whole day’s play produced only
247 runs. No previous English team has made so
tame a display in a first attempt against Victoria.
Next day the batting tail wagged cheerfully whilst
dreary Douglas continued to stonewall. Hitch, the
last man, put some of his preceding compatriots to
shame by banging the ball with discriminating judg-
ment. So the Englishmen were all out for 318, and
it was up to them to reveal a masterful capacity in
the field. This they did to some extent and in a
spasmodic fashion. That is to say, they did very
badly for a while, and then showed a sudden im-
provement, or their opponents showed a sudden de-
terioration. Making all allowances for the spasms,
I reckon the visitors’ chance in the Tests is two to .
one against, if the team that met Victoria was a
fair selection out of the crowd of 16.
Sydney grade cricket will be suspended
the coming fortnight, while Warner’s XI. wages war
on the Ma State’s representatives, for anything up to
seven days. Then S.A. falls on Ma in a Sheffield
Shield upheaval, the week after Warner’s crowd has
finished its deadly work. There is only one reason
why grade cricket should be hung up during the visit
of an English XI, and that is to swell the gate
receipts at the big matches. It has also been urged
that our younger players drink in much instruction
by watching how the expensive importations do it;
but that is a vain tale.
“H.”: Warner’s team is apparently out
after the record for dreary cricket. At Adelaide, 7f
hours’ play produced 563 runs, and at Melbourne it
was even worse, 318 runs taking 6hr. Bmin. to ac-
cumulate. The dreariest is vice-captain Douglas, who
smashed up 10 runs in 90 minutes at Adelaide, and
33 in 189 minutes at Melbourne. From a strictly
cricket standpoint, it may be the game to play, but
the parties who pay a bob a time to see cricket will
be driven to drink to break the monotony. Once
the spectator finds he won’t miss the score between
drinks, he is liable to become demoralised, take to
liquor, and arrive home in a degraded state, which
means that the Dry Baptists will place cricket on
the list of things to be avoided. The English XI
is also laying itself out for a “blob” record, nine hav-
ing been scored at Adelaide, and two at Melbourne, in
the first innings of Victoria. Eleven ducks in three
innings is a ghastly tally.
Young F. R. Foster is evidently the most
valuable asset in the English team. The righthand
batsman who bowls with his left is a born cricketer
in most cases. Foster has a free and accurate style
of batting, and an easy, tricky delivery of the ball.
He hits hard and bowls fast without any apparent
effort. In both capacities, not to mention his alert
fielding, he fills the eye as a first-class workman.
Mead, of the English team, is a very old-fashioned
cut of a batsman. Left-handed, like Kinneir, he is
not so wearisomely defensive as the latter, who
scores at the rate of 15 runs an hour, or there-
abouts. Mead doesn’t often place the ball exactly
where he meant to put it, but he has a number of
“farmer’s strokes” that are fairly safe. Wilfrid
Rhodes, among the older stagers, has kept his flesh
down, and somewhat improved his style of batting;
but none of these “sturdy” battlers from the Cold
Country would be picked for a mixed eleven in
front of D. Smith, the tall Victorian, who rattled
up 68 last Saturday.
Hitch set the crowd laughing until they get
used to his freakish way of fast bowling. The Eng-
lishman measures 17 strides for his run, and starts;
off as though he meant business. Half-way to the
bowling crease he pauses, and makes a fresh start,
putting in a foolish hop before he lets fly. There’s
an awful waste of energy in Hitch’s bowling. The
hitch in his proceeding practically cancels all the
previous impetus he has acquired, and, after all, he
seems to get no more pace on the ball than Foster
mostly achieves with a short, graceful sprint.
Woolley, a tall chap, runs round the wicket and
bowls with his left like Saunders of old—rather
faster, perhaps, than the boy Hearne, who is most
erratic. Some of Hearne’s are pitched very short,
and others offer an easy smack to the boundary;
nevertheless he gives the impression that he is
likely to be the most dangerous of the English
bowlers now and then. He disturbed Ransford’s
stumps with a “real bonza.”
The fifth round of Sydney First Grade
cricket commenced on Saturday, under ideal weather
conditions for run-getting. But it was a mixed
sort of performance, in which the balance of ad-
vantage rather inclined to the bowlers, though none
of them put up any startling displays. On the
other hand, some of the batsmen were particularly
brilliant, three of them making centuries, and one
of them a not-out century at that. These fortunate
individuals were M. A. Noble, who topped the score
with 134 for Paddington against Central Cumberland ;
P. S. Arnott, who carried his bat for 107 for Bal-
main, against Gordon; and L. A. Cody, a club-mate
of Noble’s, who built up 106 before he was caught.
Barbour, in spite of his recent troubles, batted well,
and whacked 83 for University against Sydney. He
received valuable assistance from Fisher, who con-
cussed the ball to the extent of 65. J. C. Barnes
hit 76, n. 0., for Redfern against Petersham; and
Thomas, of Waverley, accumulated 63 against the
formidable Glebe crowd. It was Paddington’s day
out, and that team, with two centuries glittering
against its name, headed the procession with 382,
for the loss of seven wickets. The next best score
was the 244 of University, against the decrepit
Sydney team which, when it essayed to reply, lost
three wickets for 86. Two clubs which stand an
excellent chance of finishing in the tureen, are
Petersham and Middle Harbor. Petersham knocked
up 107, and then Redfern got loose, and bashed 212
for the loss of six wickets. Middle Harbor, which
had made a tiny heap of 140, gasped when it saw
North Sydney pile up 159. for the loss of seven
wickets. Another team which has a fair chance for
the stock-pot is Gordon, -which, starting out to
overtake Balmain’s 220, lost four wickets for 33.
Waverley’s chances also look blue. It left 199 on
the board, and invited Glebe to better it, and Glebe
made a good start with 127, for the loss of three
wickets. Roughly, the batsmen had made 23 for
every wicket taken by the bowlers, so, after all, it
can hardly be accounted a triumph of the ball. The
best among the bowlers, who brought about this
dubious state of affairs, were Woolcott, of Middle
Harbor, who took four North Sydney wickets for
42, White, of Redfern, who got away with three
Petersham wickets for 32, and Cotter, who aided
Glebe’s triumphant progress by taking three Waver-
ley wickets for 37 runs.
* * * *
It is time someone spoke severely to some-
one else in club cricket on the matter of Sundries.
Of Redfern’s score of 212 for six wickets, no less
than 36 were scored by the reliable jflayer, and of
Paddington’s, 382 Sundries 1 yielded 23. In fact,
during the afternoon, although Waverley and Middle
Harbor bowlers gave only one each, Sundries made
a century, and scored 113. And this is not what it
ought to be.
* * * *
Fearsome as the Warner debut was, it
fell short of that of A. 0. Jones and his crew in
1907-8. That doughty crowd piled up 660 for eight
wickets, with four centuries on the list. On that
occasion, South Oss went to the devil by an innings
and 183 runs. Warner’s first innings produced only
three century bangers. Still there is balm in Gilead
in the reflection that Warner and his merry men
will find things grow tougher as they drift east and
north. Taking the S.A. bowling against Victoria
as a guide, it was obvious that it held no terrors for
the Englishmen, and they smote it according to its
merits.
That the ped. still interests some of the
public was proved by the fact that 7000 people stood
around, at the Melbourne Exhibition Oval, until 10.
to watch Donaldson down Postle in a three-distance
match. Donaldson captured the 100yds., overwhelm-
ing his opponent between 90yds. and the tape; the
official watch read 9 3-ssec., but writer’s gave it
lOsec. dead. In the 80yds Postle-was never headed;
official time, 7 4-ssec. Writer’s clock read 8 l-10sec.
The final, 110yds., saw Postle in front at 100yds., but
Donaldson’s finish again got him the verdict, by six
inches, in 10 4-5 sec., against a breeze that had
gained strength. Writer’s clock once more disagreed
bv ticking off Usee. Postle is undoubtedly the
smartest ped. alive at getting into his running. He
isn’t faster out of the holes than Donaldson, Holway
and some others. But while Postle is a champion
beginner, Donaldson is the finisher, and races are won
at the tape, and not at the half distance. In present
form, Postle is the fastest ped. living over 50 to 75
yards, but, over 130yds. writer is convinced that
Donaldson would gain a yard’s decision. Holway, off
3iyds., was just beaten by inches in the 100yds.
handicap.

The trihngular contest between Aus-
tralians Donaldson and Postle and the Yankee Hol-
way, at Adelaide last week, blew the Amurkan
right out. In all three events —100yds., 110yds.,
and 130yds.—the result was the same: Donaldson
first, Postle second, and Holway third. The time-
keepers credited the winner with some dandy speed-
ing: 9 7-10 sec. for the 100yds., for the
110yds., and 12 2-ssec. for the 130yds. It was tall
flying. About 3000 patronised the show, and were
no doubt eminently satisfied with the general hur-
riedness of the competitors.
The second half of the Dunn Challenge
Shield competition at Sydney, on Saturday, made
the gap between the South Sydney and the
other six competing clubs wider and deeper
than ever. The first day left South Syd-
ney with 171- points and University 13, but
when the curtain fell on the show, South Sydney
had accumulated points, University 21, East
Sydney 17, and the other clubs ranging down to the
nil of the Y.M.C.A. It was the day of the heathen.
The only record-breaker in the 16 events was D.
Dane’s clearance of 47ft. 3in. in the hop, step and
dance, or rather jump. By this performance, 13in.
were added to the Australasian record. Two men
scored doubles —J. W. Fraser the 120yds. and
440yds. hurdles, and J. J. Harley the one- and three-
mile walks. The result of the meeting will be to
make easier the task of -the N.S.W.- selection com-
mittee in choosing the Ma State team for the Aus-
tralasian amateur athletic blow-out in Maoriland.
The Prince Alfred Yacht Club’s race for
the Mar si,, 11 Plate began with excitement and ended
with appkuse. The wind was just made to order,
and the seven yachts were let go on a flying start
in a sudden burst of wind: Culwulla • and Rawhiti
started with a bound, Yeulba glided off, and then
the towering Thelma suddenly sprang through the
water, and went so fast that for a moment it
looked as though Mr. Jones’s yacht was going to
run amok, for they were so bunched that it seemed
impossible to avoid a collision. But the men at
the tillers kept their heads, and the yachts danced
-out into open order, and streaked away towards
Bradley’s Head. Rawhiti was in the lead, and be-
hind her Thelma washed along, having passed Cul-
wulla and Yeulba. Culwulla was running third.
This order was maintained as they rounded Manly
buoy. Right away to Shark Island Rawhiti’s cap-
tain improved his position all the time, and then,
apparently, he blundered. He got becalmed under
Bradley’s Head in the second round, and gave
Thelma a chance to make up the leeway. But
Thelma also got tied up in an empty air space, and
Rawhiti came again, and to such purpose that at
the finish it crossed the line first, followed by
Thelma and Culwulla in that order. But when the
handicaps were worked out, it was found that
Thelma was first, with Rawhiti second, and Sunbeam
third. Thelma received five minutes and Sunbeam
22min. —and these 27 solid facts upset the apple
cart.

The Sydney Flying Squadron’s handicap
saw some hard, though not gaudy, racing among the
18-footers. The breeze was an ideal one, and suited
the racers right down to the top of the water, so
that there was not a single capsize or other unto-
ward event to introduce the element of luck into the
business. The two heats and the final were splen-
didly fought out from start to finish, and as good
seamanship was the only thing that counted, the
finishes were all close. But the racing was devoid
of the spectacular duckings and so forth which ap-
peal to the heathen hearts that follow open boat
racing from the security of a steamer deck. The
close finishes were a source of mighty gratification
to the handicappers also. In the first heat Moppett’s
Mavis made the pace in a remarkable style, and
snatched the heat prize from Hero, which looked a
sure thing. Hero ran into second place. In the
second heat, George Holmes, in the Donnelly, caught
a strong gust just close to the line, and pipped Ad-
vance right on the post, as they say in horse racing.
All the same, Donnelly would not have finished first
had the handling of the extras on Advance been a
trifle smarter. Donnelly, it goes without saying,
was superbly handled. The breeze, which had been
just the thing during the two heats, began to fade
rapidly as the final started, and it faded more and
more as the race went on. But while it yet had
some strength, Advance took full advantage of it,
and rushed headlong into a lead, with 35sec. to
spare between it and the pursuing Zena, just behind
which the dangerous Mavis was dancing only 18see.
away. But the fading breeze suited Advance best
of all, and before the course was half covered it
was obvious that, without a sudden freshening of
the languid breath of Providence, Advance was to
be an easy winner. And it was even so. Mavis
downed all the rest, but was 62sec. behind Advance,
with the scratch boat, Christian Webb’s Golding,
7sec. behind.
Dick Arnst, who apparently can’t be in-
duced nowadays to get into a shell and defend his
title of champion oarsman of the world, has been
wasting some of his time and money in slaying
pigeons for side-wagers. Recently he matched him-
self against another tame murderer of birds, named
Wilkinson, for £lOO a side, the money to go to the
gun that blew the fluttering life out of the greatest
number of the 100 birds allowed to each, as they
were liberated to their natural element. Of the 200
small creatures, 175 were slaughtered within bounds,
and 25, maimed or dying, fell outside the boundary.
Arnst lost his boodle; also, he loses some more of
that public popularity which is extended to big
“sports,” but of which Arnst never received any
undue share. And, presently, if he doesn’t get to
work on the water instead of side-stepping all reason-
able offers and fair challenges, Richard Arnst will
find quite a large heap of unpopularity cooling the
atmosphere in his vicinity. Meanwhile, the police
department, which cannot bear to see two sturdy
youths punching each other’s heads with stuffed
pillows, without issuing cautions and obtaining
doctors’ certificates, and surrounding the ring with
long faces to prevent bloodshed, might turn-to one
afternoon and see if their cruelty-to-dumb-animals
machinery has got a kick left in it. #
S.A. Jockey Club has allotted the racing
dates for 1912. Those of chief interstate interest
are Adelaide Cup, May 6; Birthday Cup, June 1;
and Oakbank on Easter Monday (April 8).
By bagging the C. B. Fisher Plate, Tra-
falgar proves himself the present champion of the
Australian turf. He beat all the crack horses in the
race, finishing first to Comedy King and Malt King.
The old favorite has moved into fifth place on the
stake list, those above him being Carbine, with
£29,476; Poseidon, £19,496; Wakeful, £16,690;
and Prince Foote, £16,520. Trafalgar’s total is
£15,300, though he hasn’t yet won a Melbourne
Cup, which would put about £9OOO on to his total.

Flavian and Didus —second and third in
the Melbourne Cup—seem to have been raced to
a standstill. With respectable weights on their
backs they were both “spinning” in the Armadale
Cup at Caulfield last Saturday, and neither of them
made a ghost of a show at getting near to the
“turned loose” Mary Seaton, who led all the Way.

“0.K.” : It is an accepted dictum among
jockeys that none of the Sir Foote stock is any
good with the exception of Prince Foote, who, in his
three-year-old days, was amazingly superior to the
rest of the family. But there are other offspring
of Sir Foote that can gallop once in a way. Kyead-
gerie, for instance, was almost brilliant when tit,
but he ran a terrible lot of bad races. A.nd that s
just what is the matter with the 1 ootes; they are
soft in constitution, and difficult to train. Lord
Foote disappointed “Baron’-’ Brown by going off
almost as soon as he had come on; and Duke r oote,
when he won the Williamstown Cup the other day,
was looking very light. He couldn’t have repeated
his form a couple of days later; and it wasn t his
best form, anyhow, though it sufficed to give the
four-year-old an easy victory with 6st. 111 b. up.
The struggle for the right to keep the
£lOO Peacock Cup on the Cheffonier drew no less
than 39 teams of riflemen to Katoomba (N.S.W.j. on
Saturday last. After the smoke had blown aside,
Randwick A was observed to walk away with the
utensil, the score being 280 out of a possible 300.
Stan Edwards’s 73, out of a possible 75 points,
gathered the reward for the best individual effort.
It was the third shooting for the Peacock Cup, the
previous winners having been Parramatta, in l»o ,
and Bathurst, in 1910. #
N.S.W. Bowling Association, having re-
covered its senses, last week decided _ to instal a
scheme of district clubs. It will hit the hard-
crusted and migratory players where they live, Put,
judging by the improvements the district scheme has
made in other branches of sport, bowls should boom
as the game has never hummed before.
After all, the crew from Australia for the
rowing events of the Olympian at Stockholm, will be
continentally representative. N.S.W. Rowing Asso-
ciation had decided to send its own pet crew till it
came to consider the bill, which ran to £2uuu.
Then it got blue funk, and asked the other States to
throw in their dollars. “Not on your blanky me n
it’s only a N.S.W. crew that’s going, ’ snarled the
other States. Then the N.S.W. Association skied the
sponge, and an eight representative of all States win
be sent along. ,
Harry Hilliard played for N.S.W. against
Victoria in the first inter-State cricket match, away
hack in 1856. He is still batting excellently against
the gentleman with the scythe, and, on November ,
he scored 85, with his terrestrial wicket still up.
The N S.W. Cricket Association has decided to present
the old man with £2O, that he may m ake the purne.i
to see the inter-State match between N.S.M. and
Victoria at the year’s end.

Orkney Whisky
Murchison (Vic.) is agitated because of
the disappearance from the local graveyard
of a bronze plate which invited attention to
“the last resting place of Titambo, King of
the Goulburn blacks.” Inquiry shows that
a black brother presented himself at the
cemetery one day, stated that he was a
descendant of the dead monarch, claimed
the “King Billy” plate by hereditary right,
and carried it off. Titambo’s last public ap-
pearance, before his retreat into the Mur-
chison cemetery, was at a conference of the
A.N.A. at Shepparton. The attention of
the president was formally called to the pre-
sence of a stranger at the gathering, but he
ruled that Titambo was an Australian na-
tive, and allowed him to rema : n. For a
while Titambo listened to the debates with
an air of condescending interest; and then
he thought it a fair thing to take up a col-
lection. The royal scheme was such a suc-
cess that he attended every subsequent sit-
ting of the conference, and passed the ruins
of a faded hat each time.

speediness demanded of the motor tyre must be derived from
material of the finest, deftly handled.

THE SCOOP WAT of making Channels, Drains, sinking Dams, and doing
scores of earth working jobs “on the land.”
The horse is hitched in and off yon go!
This scoop cuts its way cleanly, fills, in a flash, and beyond a little cleaning up
with the spade at the end of the run, the job’s finished. Compare this with the
slow pick and shovel method, with its many backaches.
The bowl of our scoop is pressed cold from a solid plate of hardened steel.
(Cheap scoops are mostly hot pressed, which means weak corners.) Our scoop
lias steel runners and detachable handles.

The Barrow for roug'H use.
These TUBULAR STEEL BARROWS are without a rival wherever there is
rough usage—easily lasting out three or four wooden barrows. Trays are pressed
from a solid plate of toughest steel, without seam or rivet—thus they have much
greater strength than riveted trays of equal thickness. Note how the tubular-
handles pass round in front and protect the wheel when “dumping.”
Scores of uses on a farm for one; the tray is detaenable, too, making the
frame handy for Wood carrying. Invaluable for Mines, Mills, Furnaces, for
carting hot ashes.

ANTI NEUR ASTHIN
T S the only possible means of remedying nervous
breakdown and nerve weakness.
Drugs in the form of medicines and tonics usually
containing strychnine and iron, though sometimes
giving temporary relief, must leave the patient in a
worse condition than before.
Antineurasthin contains neither drug nor chemical,
but cures by feeding the nerve and brain cells with
their natural food element, Lecithin, in an active
organic and highly assimilable form. It is the only
means known to science of doing this.
Sufferers are cautioned against vendors who at-
tempt to substitute crude inorganic Lecithin, in the
form of pills or medicine, as a substitute for Anti-
neurasthin. These cannot be assimilated, and have
no value as a nerve food.
Antineurasthin is prepared in tablet form, pleasant
to the taste, and convenient to carry, if travelling.

Flim: Careful perusal of your letter con-
vinces us that you are a loafer, a pirate, a heredi-
tary motor-hog, a bigamist, an ass and an assassin.
To cut the matter short, you have a gift of obscenity
which should one day enable you to make a name
for yourself on the public platform—at Darling-
hurst, about 8 a.m 11.D.H.: Isn’t that dreadful
St. George’s Hospital chain-letter utterly dead yet?
Drop it. The scheme was abandoned years ago
Don Q.: Glad to hear from you. But don’t send us
a one-sheep-to-20-acres settlement lease. Give us a
20-sheep-to-one-aere irrigation patch... Noosa: Cheap
child-labor in the cow business doesn’t necessarily
mean larger profits than well-paid adult labor could
produce. The cheap-labor place is almost invariably
the place of cheap-everything-else—poor stock, poor
machinery and poor organisation. .. .Wild Harry;
Re star story. The Agricultural Editor says he
couldn’t see the point even if he sobered up for a
whole day.... White Hope: You were enthusias-
tically counted out by the office referee, who re-
marked later, to the Religious Editor that he wished
to Sheol he could disqualify you for life. The
Religious Editor replied that he’d be dashed glad if
all such copy as yours was in Blazes.... Material-
ist : Disfigured by two of the things that we loathe
most, viz., polysyllables and platitudes. .. .M. G.
Sphere: Thoughtful and so on, but a shade too John-
sonian for us. One sentence: “Notwithstanding the
weighty influences and eloquent utterances fre-
quently emanating from all shades of political
opinion, particularly the empty vaporings of certain
partisan minds wherein the impossibility of a re-
conciliation is lost in a vain and hopeless desire to
foist their poisoned fangs of ferment and idiosyn-
crasy into the minds of a trusting people deluded
by an extreme capitalistic cliqueism which persists
in an equally hopeless endeavor to create a popular
wave of fanciful illusions on which they may drift
into power at the expense of the want and misery
of those on whom they seek to ride.”. .. .Septimus:
“Promenade” does not allure us. . . .Ninam: Mild
little poem gently declined. .. .A. 8.: You misunder-
stood it. For “low-toned” read “despondent” or
“melancholy.” Sorry to hear you are battling with
ill-health. Returning letter posted in error....
M.R.H.: (V.) : Unable to use either. .Sohrab: The eat
heaves in sight too early in the narrative..... H.
James(M.L.) : Irritating series of yaps. .J.L.1.: Treat-
ment is fairly good, but there is hardly enough' in it
for us. . . .A.W.R.: Gave the fighting poem a straight
left on the ear as it came in ; then uppercut it with
the right, and stamped on all its feet. It and the
basket are now in a clinch, and the referee declines
to shout “Break .X.0.X.: Racing verses

rive: One peal:— ■
THE SABBATH BELL.
In a picturesque country village
Upon one Sabbath day,
Towards a little English church
A poor outcast did stray.
She lingered near the house of God
And recalled a bygone time
When she sauntered to the sacred church
As the Sabbath bell did chime.
An aged man observed the ragged girl
And piteously gasped my Nell.
“Father!” cried the blighted lass,
And prone at his feet she fell.
The veteran knelt and raised her form.
Alas! her soul had passed away.
The aged man mourned o’er his lifeless child
Upon the Sabbath day.
. . .Arthur O. H.: Moloney’s eye is now in the basket.
The other contribution is adjacent.. .H.D.S. (M.L.) :
With tears in our eyes, we assure you that we
don’t want any more. . . .H.K.: You are quite right.
You have been shut out of these columns through
the deadly enmity of the First Fish Liar. He has
only to be handed a contribution by you to develop
enough enmity to work a large foundry. It is rather
like soaping a geyser to give him something of yours
,to read. When we handed him the last two poems
he quivered with rage, then boiled out of his chair,
and shot them 8000 ft. into the air. .. . J.M.: We
calculate the hansom cab lady runs to something
like 11,000 words. That is one reason why she
can’t drive through these pages... .Claude S.: Two
lines: —
Love, like a fire, sinks and dies and ashes lie about
When in a silent stream your tears descend and put
it out.
Do you think you could induce her to weep along
the roads? The dust nuisance is really terrible just
now, and the whir of an approaching motor makes
the Religious Editor dive into pubs so often that our
church notes are suffering.... Cadonia: Unsuitable.
... .Cootapatamba: The first part is tedious, and
the whole story lacks point... Coolibah: Yarn doesn’t
score. Seems careful work; but it travels at a
steady pace across nearly 14 pages of foolscap, and,
although on a grim, mysterious theme, never suc-
ceeds in gripping the attention hard M.F.Ii.:
Verses have some grace. Try and do better....
J. (M.L.) : Sorry both fail. .W.M.: “Emi-
grant’s Welcome” healthy, optimistic verse; but it
can’t be tacked up here.... Will H.: We won’t this
time.... Finance: The British debt isn’t decreasing
these days; it is probably growing faster than any
other debt on earth. The Government saves its face
by paying something each year off Consols, which are
called the “National Debt.” But the “guaranteed
loans” and the “other liabilities” are quite as much
debt as the Consols. And corporation loans, which
stand for a great deal of the public works which are
here charged to the public debt, grow amazingly.
The total debt increased about £600,000,000 since
the beginning of this century.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
Douglas S.: The fact that you are a novice speaks
—nay, howls—-for itself.... Dorothy F.: Regret it
is hardly up to mark.... Hedley V. G.: Humorous,
but it isn’t a pleasant subject... .Les R.: Joke too
ancient, and picture not of much account.... Cliff
K. : Too unutterably scratchy. .. .Chen Ko: The
maddest picture we’ve seen for a long time, and
there isn’t much humor in - its madness either....
L. : The jest is an old United States niggerism,
the horse is a wooden horse, and the characters are
a freak talking to a missing link.
The big strike in Britain lias been mak-
ing the Stout Person think hard. The
Financial Times, for instance, in review-
ing the upheaval, says :
The fact that the wages of railway workers have
only risen 11 per cent, since 1900, while the cost
of living has heavily increased, will clearly have to
be taken into account if any permanent settlement
of the trouble is to be reached. It is little good
blinking plain conclusions.
The Investor’s Review examines the
worker thus: —
This man says to the capitalist: “You must give
us toilers a larger share in the profits of your busi-
ness. Why should you amass your millions, pile for-
tune on fortune, monopolise much of the finest soil
of the country for your parks and palaces, while we
live in rack-rented hovels and depend on charity to
avoid a pauper’s grave?” It is no answer, only an
aggravation of the danger, to call this man a vile
intriguing Socialist and order him to be suppressed
by brute force.
In a word, the Stout Character begins to
suspect that the Time is about Ripe
“Watch Below” writes:—
N.S.W. Marine Court has decided that it doesn’t
know What happened to the ill-fated steamer Rose-
dale. Backhouse, the presiding- Judge, dismissed
the theory that it struck Fish Rock by saying that
had it done so the hull would have been found.
Maybe; but I’d like to call attention to the fact
that the steamer Macleay, also running on the North
Coast, admittedly struck one of two islands oil Fort
Stephens, and although searchers were examining
the spot within 48 hours of the accident, not a
trace could be found. I don’t say that the K ? sed jr e
was not struck by lightning, as suggested by the
Court, because I couldn’t say it in any way that
would absolve me from contempt of Court. And
least said is soonest ended.

A German Opinion of BEALE PIANOS
“ M USICAL O PINION AND M usic Trade Review/’ London, July, 1911, says:—
“A Hamburg trade journalist, who has just returned from the Antipodes, states that the pianos
“manufactured by the Beale Company in Sydney greatly resemble in touch and in tone those turned
“out at the best German factories. The Beale is sold at forty-five pounds and upwards, and enjoys
“a good reputation not only in Australia but in India, Java, South Sea Islands and other colonial
“countries with hot climates. The ‘Hamburger’ fears that if these British colonials extend their piano
“manufacturing operations there will be little room left for continental makers in the musical
“instrument line.”

BABY’S SEVERE SKIN
DISEASE CUBED
By Cuticura Soap and Ointment.
Doctor Called It “the Itch.” She
Could Not Sleep and Used to
Scratch Herself to Pieces.
"I had a young baby left in my care about
two years ago, and the child caught a very
severe form of skin disease. She was only
a few months old when the skin disease
first appeared on her body just like little
water blisters under the skin, and it useu
to irritate the child that much, that she
could not sleep night or day, and she used
to scratch herself to pieces. Even in her
sleep, she would scratch. So I took her to
the doctor after trying a patent ointment,
and he told me it was a very contagious
disease, called the itch. I kept going to
the doctor, but nothing he gave me seemed
to do the child any good, so I took her to
another doctor and he gave me every possible
kind of ointment that he could prescribe, but
it all did no good.
"Then I saw one of the Cuticura adver-
tisements and I at once sent for a sample
and applied it. I found that it seemed to
cool the affected parts at once, so I procured
a pot of Cuticura Ointment and a cake of
Cuticura Soap, and bathed the child all over
with warm water and then applied the Cuti-
cura Ointment. In a few days I was aston-
ished at the difference, the more so, because
the child had been suffering so long, for
twelve months, and such a state she was in.
The whole of her body and even her head
was affected. It is six months since I left
off using the Cuticura Remedies, and she
hasn’t had a sign of the trouble since.
"I had tried everything for it. but nothing
seemed to ease or cure it, till I tried the
Cuticura Soap and Ointment. Then she
seemed to get ease directly it was applied
and I continued to apply it till the trouble
disappeared entirely and she was entirely
cured by the Cuticura Soap and Ointment.’
(Signed) Mrs Ethel Christian, 5 Vincent St.,
Balmain, Sydney, N. S. W., May 16,1911.
Although Cuticura Soap and Ointment are

An Interesting
Experiment.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“half" will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

Walnut Stain
is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,

The country alderman persists in his tender regard
for the fine feelings of the dishonest milkman. Re-
cently, the Kempsey (N.S.W.) Council received
word from the Board of Health that two samples of
milk supplied by local milk vendors were deficient
in butter fat, and considerably adulterated. The
Board advised prosecution, but at the next council
meeting a majority of the aldermen decided that a
caution would be sufficient. The Board thereupon
sent a second and much stronger letter to the coun-
cil, telling it to get to work, and not argue about it,
either; and at latest advices the council was looking
for the malefactors with a summons in one hand and
an apology in the other. If some of these country
aldermen saw a neighbor’s baby being worried to
death by a bulldog, they would apologise to the bull-
dog before disturbing him during meal-time.

“Klifton”: “The Hack” falls heavily when he says
(B. 19/10/’ll) that some of the authorised news-
agents make 4d. and even sd. a dozen on the dailies.
No Melbourne agent, whether authorised or other-
wise, can possibly make more than 25 per cent, on
the morning papers. As for the evening paper—
well, apart from the few copies he sells in the shop,
there is hardly any profit at all, because the boys
get two-thirds of it. I know one agent who was
coerced into giving 2id. a dozen, and he is still pay-
ing that rate. All he gets for his trouble is Jd. per
dozen, and a discount for prompt payment of his ac-
count. Nevertheless,, the majority of newsagents—
cash or authorised —do well out of the business.
Generally speaking, the profits on both papers and
stationery are satisfactory; the expenses are not
high; and, if the agent keeps a close watch on his
customers, he will make very few bad debts—espec-
ially if he is in a democratic district. It is in the
districts where there is the dreadful struggle to
“keep up appearances” that the agent is oftenest
dropped into the soup.

“Vagabond”: A company with a capital of
£30,000 has been formed in New York for the pur-
pose of burgling the sea-bottom beside the Auckland
Isles, away south of Maoriland, and looking for the
debris of the. good ship General Grant,, which found
a fishy grave there in 1866.- It was bound from Mel-
bourne to London with £50,000 worth of gold on the
manifest; and there is reason to believe that 15
cases described as “sundries” also contained gold.
The passengers, too, were mostly gold miners, and it
is safe to assume that they had more than the price
of a drink about their bones. But 1866 is 45 years
ago, and the Auckland Isles have about 45 gales a
week, and the great rollers come in at the rate of
45 rollers per minute, and are 45ft. high ; so there
are doubts about the success of the expedition. In
fact, there is hardly anything about it except doubts.

A Melbourne wood-merchant’s yarn:. Let me, for
once, tell the truth and shame the Age, The Bulle-
tif and the Devil. The Age, girding at us, as-
serted that sawn and split wood could be bought in
the truck for 3s. per ton, while we thieves extort
Is. sd. per cwt. for it. Inquiry showed that the
wood referred to was ■ unsawn, unsplit, common 2ft.
wood, which is advertised daily at 11s. per ton; yet
I haven’t seen any Age contradiction of the previous
yarn. Look up the freight from Rokeby, where the
wood was said to come from, and you’ll find the
freight 6s. per ton, making the total cost 9s. per
ton, whilst its selling price in Melbourne is 11s. per
ton. There’s a margin of only 2s. there. The lowest
price I have paid this winter for similar wood is £ 2
a truck (six or seven tons), with ■£! per truck
freight. As regards box wood,'the sawmillers ■ are a
much wealthier and , better organised body than we
wood merchants. The Sawmillers’ Association meets
every month, and fixes a minimum price per truck.
As we buy by the truck, and not by the ton, the
innocent countryman becomes an adept at faking a
truck. Yet so thoroughly have they got us by the
wool that if we venture a word of complaint we are
promptly told to go to the Devil for our fuel. The
average cost of boxwood in Melbourne this winter was
£7 per truck, equal to Is. per cwt. on rails. From
the rails it is carted to the yards at a cost of
over id. a cwt., and split and bagged (lid.), leav-
ing a profit of 121 per cent. Many small woodmen
had this winter to travel from siding to siding to
buy wood to keep their customers going, and that
meant more expense. Take it from me, half of the
men in the trade are trying to sell out.
“Billy T.”: On a recent pleasant afternoon, in
Fitzroy Gardens (Melb.), the finer instincts of
woman seized a noble opportunity. An elderly man,
in a wheeled chair, was making repeated efforts to
surmount, a high, grass-grown bafik. He would run
his vehicle half-way up, then come back with a rush,
while three or four coarse brutes of men (of whom,
I regret to say, I was one), reclining on the sward
hard by, indulged in gusts of coarse and brainless
merriment at every failure. The nice girl chanced
upon this shameful spectacle. She Was dressed all
in tender blue, and was as sweet a candidate for the
heavenly choir as I have seen this spring. She saw
the poor man in the chair make three heroic tries;
she heard the wild laughter of the things calling
themselves men; and then her whole soul revolted.
She marched to the guffawing push, she stamped her
little foot at them, and her spirit blazed in her beau-
tiful eyes. “Brutes!” she cried. “Brutes! Cow-
ards !” Then she went to the misfortunate wretch
in the chair, seized the vehicle in a resolute grasp,
and said: “My poor fellow, let me help you.” She
did not find the uphill rush an easy thing, but de-
livered the goods all right. Then the man in the
apparatus said: “Thank you, Miss, but the fact is
I’m the inventor of this new style of invalid chair,
and I was just showing those people how the thing

The Argus, frisking with the airy grace of an aged
rhinoceros, comments on the position of the working
man, longing for a bank “into which he could
proudly enter, and, on the right of his simple man-
hood, obtain an overdraft in a free, easy and access-
ible manner,” and his bitter disappointment on find-
ing that the proposed Commonwealth Bank makes
no especial provision for him. The festive behemoth
continues: “He might, by inference, find himself
provided for in the savings bank provisions; but
such an inference would, of course, be absurd, for
what he wants, and what he has been promised, is a
bank that he can borrow from —not a bank that
wants to borrow from him.”
Join, lumpers, navvies, curse the bank of State,
And, plumbers, lab’rers, fiercely execrate
This Andy Fisher, Labor leader, who
Declines to lend a poor bricklayer’s mate
A cool five thousand on his I 0 U,
As kindly private bankers always do.
A caustic sprite, a meteoric wit
It was inscribed that biting Argus skit
Against the grasping, horny-handed fool
Who dreamed he, too, might get his little bit,
And borrow hundreds “on his face,” a rule
Not quite unknown in Fat’s financial school.
When banks were daily blowing up, and “puff”
Went great societies of ours, the stuff,
We recollect, was scattered on the pert,
Slim working-men who engineered the bluff.
’Twas carters, smiths and factory hands alert
Who’d borrowed thousands on each pinch of dirt.
To-day, when apprehension stalks the street,
And bankers have a coldness of the feet,
It is because, with kindness almost daft,
They’ve lent some carpenters a million neat,
Or given to seafaring sons of graft
Each man a lovely, bloated overdraft.
No wonder hope and expectation high
Inflamed the smudgy tinker in his sty,
And warmed the hansom cabbies on the ranks,
Since these have all, in happy days gone by,
Been free to play up high financial pranks,
And bring to ruin too confiding banks.
VICTORIA.

DECEMBER 9
, J ... • ' . V "'0 - . .. '■ ’
is the very latest date on which an order for the new Encyclopaedia
Britannica may be sent at the present minimum prices. After that
date the price will be permanently raised to conform with the advanced
price at which the work is now being sold in Great Britain and the
United States. As a concession to distant readers, however, orders
bearing a post-mark not later than December 9 will be accepted at the
minimum price, even though delayed in transmission. The wisest plan
is to take no risks, but to send your order this very day for a work
that no sensible person can afford to be without.
Australian Opinions of
the new Encyclopaedia
Britannica.
Numerous letters have been re-
ceived in which Australian pur-
chasers express their high ap-
preciation of the new Encyclopae-
dia Britannica. Only a few brief
extracts can here be quoted. Prof.
H. A. Thomson (Melbourne)
“looks on the purchase as one cc
the best possibly.’' Judge Heydon
“looks at it every day with increas-
ed satisfaction.”, Mr. R. S. Sugars
(Melbourne) thinks the work ‘a
hignly desirable adjunct to the
equipment of a modern business
office.” Mr. i.lolesworth Greene
(Rowsley) says that “the volumes
can be easily and pleasantly read
while sitting in an armchair.” A
notable feature is emphasised by
those who write, like Prof. R. D.
Watt (Sydney) that it is “quite
up-to-date;” like Mr. G. Hudson
(Sydney) that it is “thoroughly
up-to-date;” or like Mr. H. A.
Hunt (Commonwealth Meteorolo-
gist) that “the latest develop-
ments and phase of meteorological
science are well and ably repre-
sented.” The educational value ct
the work for the young is empha-
sized by many purchasers; Mr.
E. A. D:eves (Leichhardt), for in-
stance. says that “to those who de-
sire to give their sons a thorough
education the 11th edition is in-
valuable;” Mr. John Box, M. 8.,
B.S. (Melbourne) foreseen “much
pleasure and profit to his boys and
himself from it.” , The practical
value of the work is illustrated by
the statement of Mr. H. R. Treatt
(Cobar) that lie lias already “got-
ten about £ 3 or £ 4 worth of in-
formation from it;” or of Mr. T.
Eraser, C.E. (Sydney) tnat "it is
Worth more than many libraries to
those who are engaged in the pro-
fession of engineering, or any of
its numerous branches.”

This photograph compares the new Encyclopaedia Britannica with the
10th edition. The 29 slender volumes in front contain 2 million words more
than th£ 35 volumes behind, yet occupy only one-third of the space.
Low Price and Easy
Terms for Prompt Pur-
chasers.
For those who send their orders
within the few remaining days of
the advance sale in Australia, the
new Encyclopaedia Britannica is
avail"’'in on the most favourable
terms that can ever be offered.
The complete work can be pur-
chased at the minimum price of
15s lOd per volume, in cloth
binding, and on correspondingly
advantageous terms for the im-
pression on India paper and the
flexible leather bindings, which
commend themselves to 90 per
cent, of buyers who have examin-
ed the various styles in which the
work is published. These terms
represent an advantage of 47 per
cent, from the price of 30s per
volume, in cloth binding, at which
the last complete edition was ori-
ginally published, and at which
the new 11th edition will ulti-
mately be sold.
The minimum price has already
been increased in England and
America, where the work is now
being sold at an advanced rate. It
will be increased in the Common-
wealth at midnight of December 9,
and any orders sent thereafter will
only be accepted at the advanced
price. Orders posted on or before
December 9, however, will be ac-
cepted at the present rate, even
though they arrive some days
later, for the purpose of giving an
equal opportunity to purchasers in
the most distant parts of the Com-
monwealth.
Full particulars of the new En-
cyclopaedia Britahn.iqa will be
sent on receipt of the
coupon, which will not appear’
again in this paper. The time is
so short that application should be
made at once by any who have not
yet received the prospectus.
Only two weeks are left during which you can buy the
new Encyclopaedia Britannica at the minimum price. It is
therefore advisable that you should at once make up your
mind with regard to a purchase which so many prominent
Australians have already found indispensable. There is
just time to obtain particulars ; but the annexed coupon
will not appear again in this paper, and it should therefore
be used to-day without fail,. in order to obtain the full
account of the work,, which will be sent gratis and post
free on application.

SHOPPING BY POST
OUTSIDE of Brisbane there are thousands of men *>bo haoe no conveniences
for the matter of purchasing their needs for wear and use. *Co obviate this
difficulty we have just issued a new series of our large
Commonwealth CATALOGUE
SERIES 4
This is the finest and most comprehensive of its fyind in Australasia, beautifully
illustrated and contains Prices and Patterns of materials, and is, withalL a
•handsome and useful book . . « . . A copy trill be mailed on request
PIKE BROTHERS, LTD., BRISBANE
Martin’s Pills are sold by all chemists and
stores in Australasia. Ladies recommend
them. Be sure you get the genuine with the
signature, Martin, Chemist, Southampton.*
There’s a chap out Coonabarabran way who started
out to look for his rival in love, Bill, with an axe.
This rival was a business rival, too, and the trouble
was all over a moustache. Bill (we’ll call''him Bill)
had a long, flowing mo—Jack (any old name will
do) had none, and, of course, the fair Flossie gave
her affections to the man with the mo! They all
do. • That’s when Jack started out with the' axe.
But he changed his mind from murder to a mous-
tache. With clear insight he saw the reason of
Flossie’s preference. Straightway he sent to Craig
and Aitken’s, Sydney, for a jar of Capillarine, the
famous moustache producer. He rubbed this in over-
night, and in a few weeks he had a moustache like
a Russian Hussar. Then he went courting Flossie
again. Fickle Flossie! The mo. put poor Bill’s pot
on! She became Mrs. Jack; and Mr. Jack, mo. and
all, is now a leading public man up Coonabarabran
way. Successful in love and in business all because
of Capillarine, the great mo. grower.*
FOR BABIES.
There is no better medicine made for babies than
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. Its pleasant taste
and prompt and effective cures make it a favorite
with mothers of small children. It quickly cures
their coughs and colds and prevents pneumonia and
other serious consequences.*
A Christmas Suggestion.
It is as difficult to choose the perfect
Christmas present as the perfect wedding
present. Now is the time when you are
worrying over the Christmas reminder
you will send to your friends overseas.
The perfect Christmas present for the
other side of the world must be easily
packed ; it must not be fragile; it must
not be the sort of gift that could be
bought in your friend’s town; it must be
uniquely Australian —in short, it must
be the half-yearly bound volume of The
Lone Hand.
This gift, the May-Oetober volume, is
bound handsomely in cloth with gold em-
bossings. It is the essence of Australia
—as characteristically Australian as the
scent of gum leaves. Not only is it a
beautiful present, but it is' a great
national advertisement for your own
country. It tells your friends overseas
more about Australia than all the letters
you could write.
As the volumes are now being bound,
it is advisable for you to send in your
order at once —Price, 6/6. Postage :
Australasia, 1/2; otherwise, 2/4.
The only guarantee readers have of
getting The Lone Hand regularly
month by month, without missing a num-
ber, is to subscribe. The subscription
rates are :
Australasia: 6/- per annum',, post free;
or 3/- for six months, post free.
Abroad: 9/- per annum, post free.
IN BANANA LAND
According to Premier Denham sixty per
cent, of the would-be female emigrants, who
apply to the Agent-General in London, are
rejected. Such a wholesale spurning looks
like a serious reflection ’on John Bull’s
womankind.
The Brisbane Water and Sewerage Board
has some big reservoir work in view, 'and it
wants £50,000 worth of cement. Cement, as
good as any in the world, is made in Aus-
tralia, but, though the Board might, therefore,
reasonably have prescribed Australian ce-
ment, it compromised by ruling out all but
Australian, British and American goods.
Thereupon, the dreadful Courier wept bit-
terly over “a public body taking a step, either
overt or covert, that will increase the disa-
bilities already imposed on German manu-
factures by the Federal Parliament.” That
blow-out of the Courier’s patriotism was
followed by a meeting of the Board, at which
the preference for goods made by English-
speaking people was knocked on the head, a
motion being carried that circulars should
be sent to contractors who had received
specifications, “informing them that the re-
strictions on the source of cement were re-
moved, and that the only requirement was
that the cement should come up to the re-
quirements of the test.” Only the President
(E. J. T. Manchester) and Laborite Tom
Wilson voted against this. The former
caustically remarked : “We know that money
is taken away from here by Germans, and
you know what Germany has been doing of
late on the Continent of Europe. Why
should we help Germans to buy bullets?”
Naturally, this argument does not appeal to
Hertzberg and the other importers on the
Board, and so the motion in favor of foreign
goods simply flew through.
James Nash, discoverer of Gympie gold-
field, has appealed to the Queensland Gov-
ernment for an annuity of £lOO. He is 78,
can’t work, and isn’t a millionaire. Years
ago he received a grant of £lOOO, but he
spent it, not being sure, at the time, that he
was going to live to be 78.
In order to induce the Assembly to acqui-
esce in the rescinding of the C. D. Act, Pre-
mier Denham has promised a new measure,
based on scientific lines, dealing with both
sexes in even-handed fashion. Meantime,
public solicitation, a thing hitherto almost
unknown in Brisbane, has become painfully
frequent. Floreat Wowseria !
November 9 was the 50th anniversary of
the opening of the telegraph line from Syd-
ney to Brisbane for public business. Three
days previously, Governor Young (N.S.W.)
had sent a wire to Governor Bowen (Bana-
naland) congratulating him upon the com-
pletion of tne work. The rates were pretty
high in those davs —-from Brisbane to Syd-
ney, 6s. for the first 10 words, and 4d. for
each additional word; to Melbourne, 9s. for
the first 10 words, and 6d. for each addi-
tional ; and to Adelaide, 12s. for the first 10
words, and Bd. tor every additional remark.
BOARD OF A KIND.
SWAGGIE : “ Wot do 'e give yer a week?”
EX-SWAGGIE : “ Fifteen bloomin’ bob.”
SWAGGIE : "An' kept?"
EX-SWAGGIE: "My oath! Kepi go in’ all day long.”
Charity is a strange and unaccountable
spasm. Brisbane, a city that has for years
scandalously starved its principal hospital,
was appealed to recently to assist the orphan
children of a pair 'of drowned immigrants.
The handsome sum of £2500 was raised in a
week or two. Meantime, the hapless hospi-
tal will probably drift along on the old starv-
ation lines unless the Government steps in
to save it.
Chancellor William McGregor, addressing
the governing body Of the baby University,
hoped “that the Senate had made up its
mind on this point, that it was not going
to supply back-door degrees of any sort
whatever.” Well, for a start, it conferred a
degree on an ex-politician entirely devoid of
literary or scientific qualifications; and, up
to now, it hasn’t shown any contrition for
the vandalism.
Dalby Town Council has owed the Trea-
sury about £2200 for the last dozen years,
and successive Treasurers have failed to
screw redemption and interest out of the
sunburnt village. The other day it negoti-
ated a loan of £l2BO with a bank, and it
then transpired that the Government had
agreed to accept this sum as payment in full.
Thus Dalby is now once more free to cadge
at the Treasury doorstep. An approaching
election may account for many things; all
the same, the evil precedent set in this
matter is pretty sure to encourage a host of
future municipal defaulters.
A Prospective Enthusiast!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was fortunate that the Agent : General accom-
panied the Minister on some of these railway open-
ing trips. To complete the lines —-and they form
only a small proportion of the authorised new mile-
age of the State —it will be necessary to borrow
more money from British capitalists. T. B. Robin-
son is intimately associated with these capitalists or
their representatives, and he will go home well
qualified to prove by indubitable testimony that the
Government railway programme—adventurous as it
may be—is more than justified by the income-earn-
ing value of the line.— Leading article in Brisbane
Daily Mail.
The Drought.—Ominous reports of the ravages of
drought on certain cattle stations in the Rockhamp-
ton district are to hand. There has been practi-
cally no rain for six months, and on one station at
least cattle are dying daily, the management finding
some difficulty in keeping pace with the necessity
for preventing total loss by the prompt removal of
the hides.— Casual par. in next column of Mail.
Tom B.
Robinson, he
Who’s filling in London the job of A.-G.,
In a very short time will return oversea.
He’s been home for a spell—-
And he’s feeling quite well —
And when he goes back he’ll have something to tell;
Something joyous and cheering,
To keep Bull from fearing
He’s risking too much of his good £ s. d.
Tom B.
Robinson, he
Will be able to talk in a confident key.
He’ll be able to say,
In a large, solemn way,
“We’re laying our railways a mile in a day !
Of course, we must borrow,
We’ll pay back to-morrow,
And as to the interest— Fiddle-de-dee !
Yes; the seasons are hot,
And we owe you a lot,
Some Forty-five Millions, I think —Let me see?...
But the money’s all right—-you, can take it from
Me!”
Tom B.
Robinson, he
Oan say a kind word for Premier D. —
Digby Denham, to wit,
Who has every bit
As much faith in Loans as in, say, Holy Writ !
Tom can say that the scheme
Is as fair as a dream,
Though its size makes the average Solomon scream!
While as for the Drought,
Which is knocking about,
A wave of the hand puts that Bogey to rout—
A shrug of the shoulders can cause it to flee!
To hint the scheme’s rash
Might scare Bull and his cash,
If the thing’s to go through it must go with a Dash!
Dash the Drought!
Dash Expense !
Dash all caution and sense!, . .

MONTY PEET.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, November 18, 1911.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
The Clan has fallen back upon the capital
after a forced march into .the wilds of Bun-
daberg, where the Chieftain won over the
allegiance of local outlaws by the way
in which he tossed into position the founda-
tion stone of a hospital. The Macgregors
have decided that they will stick to Brisbane
during the summer months, and take week-
end trips aboard the Lucinda* instead of
going into residence in the cool qf the Too-
woomba ranges.
Notwithstanding the heat, the Brisbane
Club gathered in all its wives and daughters
the other night, and treated them to wine
and song as generously as if they were
somebody else’s wives and daughters. Robt.
Kaye, of Liedertafel fame, and Mrs. Gilbert
IV ilson—who for the occasion draped her
graceful form in pink ninon and satin, and
illustrated it with a pink rose posy—were
responsible for the music. Don’t know who
was responsible for the champagne cup, but
he was a good second ; in fact, he was practi-
cally a dead heat. The president and Mrs.
John Reid, she in black lace and expensive
jet, extended the warm—even boiling—wel-
come to each comer, and all went well, in-
cluding the untamed amateur, who wailed a
harrowing recitation. He had to go well.
If he hadn’t, they’d have caught him and
pulled his voice out with a corkscrew.
The Automobile Club, recently galvan-
ised into activity, has stopped giving itself
tea at the committee’s expense, and, next
Saturday, will give vent to a new dissipa-
tion, by rounding up as many of Brisbane’s
sick, crippled, or very poor children as pos-
sible, and motoring them out to Sandgate.
Ginger pop, sponge roll and the like will be
laid on with a lavish hand. Arrangements
have been made to accommodate about 200,
but an extra Boy Blue or two can always
sit on big sister’s knee, or an extra motor-
car can be collected. Anybody who would
refuse to lend a car for such an object
doesn’t deserve to have one.
The George Eddington departure, this
week, was red-lettered with presentations.
From a number of friends, Mrs. Eddington
received a beautiful diamond and aqua-
marine pendant. Her husband was dealt
with more heavily, having a handsome
roll-top desk and chair, with solid
silver cigar box, candlesticks and inkstands,
and a few other massive specks of furniture,
heaped upon him by the officers of the
B.N.S.W. Over that penurious institution
he has presided for 21 years, and he has
helped to keep the wolf from the overdraft
for nearly 40 years.
The Very Best People were scantily repre-
sented at Tattersall’s Races to-day, and
frocking was mostly noticeable by its ordin-
ariness. The “boiled rag” covered a multi-
tude of shins. The sickest-looking man on
the course poured this hard-luck story into my
sympathetic ears: Wifie, having an unac-
countable fancy for an outsider, pressed a
sov. into his hand, with injunctions to “put
it on” for her. Instead, he persuaded her
that her choice would whip in the field,
whereas, “the cow,” as he called the animal,
bolted home, and paid a fine, large dividend
of £l2. And when I saw madame in the
stand, she had a hard, set face that two
new hats couldn’t melt. Why they allow
cows to run in horse races I can’t under-
stand. I looked for the animal afterwards,
but failed to see it. Perhaps, after winning
its race, it had gone home to be milked.
On Wednesday, Miss Ruth Phillips, daugh-
ter of G. Phillips, C.E., donned creme crepe
de chine and some beautiful Spanish lace,
and graciously accepted the name of King
from William, a son of the musical Myers
King. The little Baptist Church at Sand-
gate was crowded with friends, pink and
blue bridesmaids, roses and confetti, good
wishes and bloodthirsty hatpins. The same
day witnessed the knot-tying of Miss Miete
Struve, one of our leading spirits in local
amateur theatricalism, , and Mr. W. Turk.
Likewise, last week, scores of relatives jour-
neyed to Rockhampton with snugly-packed
new frocks to wear at the marriage of Miss
Mabel Williams and Mr. H. Woolcock. The
bridegroom is a cousin of the singing Mabel
Woolcock and of the legal J. L. Woolcocks.
Fogland is giving up at least some of its
victims. At the end of the year, Mrs. Leon-
ard Turner and daughter Jean will return to
Queensland after four or five seasons in
Italy, Germany, and, latterly, England. Dr.
and Mrs. Macdonald (she belongs to the
McWhirter family) will come back by the
Orvieto after a honeymoon in Europe; and
barrister T. W. Bain has sufficiently re-
covered from an attack of Londonitis to sit
up and take a little nourishment in India en
route for home.
The mothers of this generation, my dear
Thargomindah, have no need to bother over
the world-old question: “What shall we do
with our boys?” When all else fails, Sonny
can be successfully let loose as a chemist.
This is made possible by the fact that our
wise and revered legislators have decided
that the budding arsenic-dealer need not
pass examinations, but may hang out his
sign—yea, even if he hath been “plucked”.
70 times seven —after a five years’ appren-
ticeship. From this day out, my dear, I’ll
be a-feared to buy even a packet of nose-
chalk.
Girls, be upstanding and rejoice! Many,
a time and oft have we been told that our
Yankee cousins beat us out of sight when it
comes to dressing; but a hail from the land
of G. Wash, tells me that “the women look
positively dowdy after London and Paris;
and the girls at home [Australia] dress
more neatly, and walk better than most
Americans.” Let ’em all come!
The latest in our midst is a flourishing
girls’ club-room, managed by the members of
the Queensland Ladies’ Amateur Swimming
Association. The fee is small, and the rooms
attractive, and, as our mermaids are many,
the venture promises to be an unqualified
success. Talking about athletic girls, re-
minds me that the Ladies’ Rowing Club will
send a team to Melbourne, its efforts in the
matter of collecting the necessary lucre hav-
ing met with generous responses. Miss Was-
sell will manage the team, and Miss Isabel
Roberts, the guiding light of the show, will
captain it.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
It is bad enough for an Australian police
magistrate to publicly admit bias, but to go
further and declare from the bench, where
justice, etc., is dispensed, partiality for the
Chow, establishes the permanent and irre-
ducible limit. Yet, if one Grant, P.M., has
not been flagrantly misreported by. the
Cairns Post, he is the magistrate who
established the record. On November 6, at
Cairns, one Ah Look was charged with
having committed an offence against the
Fisheries Act. He pleaded guilty, and, says
the beak, “I cannot get away from that:’
Then runs the report: —
P.M.: What are the expenses in connection with
this case?
Prosecuting Counsel : Costs of Court 3s. 6d.,
and the Inspector had to hire a sulky to serve the
summons.
P.M.: I don’t believe in piling it on to Chinamen.
I WOULD SOONER PILE IT ON TO WHITE
PEOPLE.
At time of writing Grant was still on the
Bench!

The Wine of the Barley.
FOR countless generations Ale has been a favorite beverage.
It was drunk in Egypt 3000 years before the Christian
era; it was knov/n and appreciated by the ancient Gauls;
it was the favorite liquor of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, and
is still the premier drink of the most alert and active peoples of
the world. It was the drink of the lusty and strong, the
“doers” in the history of the past.
Cascade Ale, brewed by the Cascade Brewery Co., of Hobart,
is akin to the ale of old England, for it is rich in the qualities that
promote Health and strength. That its merits are appreciated by
those most competent to judge is proved by the rapidly-growing
sales in every part of the Commonwealth.
Sold at all first-class hotels and stores.

A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results.

The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hair-Growing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no. need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
1 am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
•to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that X could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
■visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time—yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantitv of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. Ido not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not. interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far
the cheapest.

The Victorian Government Statistician has
fjot so tired of putting the minus sign under

lie has dropped the heading altogether, and
now in his population returns he has the

sign opposite the rare years when more
people came in than went out. In the last

A CIGAR is the BEST
SMOKE OP ALL!
But why caivt you get a
Good Cigar in the Country?
£UVY\>
ALL over Australasia, the only places you' can
buy>a really high-class Cigar is in the big
cities. In the country districts a good Cigar
cannot be had; because it’s only at the pubs that
you can buy Cigars at all in the out-baclc districts.
The publican knows that selling liquor pays him
better.. He reckons that his customers only call
for a Cigar when they’ve got a few drinks in and
want to dodge getting “fu’ the noo.” Any old
Cigar does for that. \
So he buys a few hundred at a time from
some “back-yarder ” —real “Flor de Cabbage”
with big gold pictures all over the box and
mighty pretty bands round them —made from the
waste leaf and the cheapest growths, but called
by some high-falutin’ name. (The making of these
Cigars is another Story—till tell you about it
another time.)
a
Tbestorekeeper or tobac-
conist in country towns does
not sell good Cigars either..
If he does, he has to add. to
the selling price of the Cigar,,
the maker’s profit, the:profit
of the warehouseman he
buys’from, the profit, of the
traveller who calls andl sells
them tb liim„ and his awn
profit.. “
So that a good Cigar
that sells in the city at.6d.
he’d have to charge gd..fbr,
and not grow fat on it then,
because the numberhe would
sell would be small; and
good Cigars have to be kept
in sc- uniform temperature,
freer from exposure tty the
air,or else they’ll go off.'
Those are just some of
the reasons why you can’t
get a good Cigar in the
country parts of Australia,
and also why so very few
Cigarsnreat present.smoked
in the country.
Buy a IOQ-box: oT my
“ DIADEMAS,” smoke 5.0 r
6 of them, ; and, if they’re
not as good as any 621.
Cigar you’ve ever smoked,
you needn’tpay a penny..
Thatls the way I’m in-
troducing. my Cigars into
Australia. I know Cagar-
making from A to Z.. I.know
these DIADEMAS'Cigars of
mine are just the coolest,
smoothest, and most luxu-
rious smoke any man could wish. for.. Cigar-
smokers of a lifetime say so ;■ and. the more you
know about a good Cigar- the better: you’.ll like
them.
My DIADEMAS are madec from tlie very;
finest, mild, rich, mellow, Java.leaf, the fillingor
inside heart of the Cigar being all straight long
Brazilian. The Cigars are hand made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass' me- before it
goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed to
bum free and draw easily. The Cigar is 4 inches
long, and the picture.at theoffide is a copy of.it,,
exact in size and shape.
Now, this DIADEM AS' Gagar is as good as
any 6d. Cigar, sold in the cities by high-class
tobacconists, asrl.sell indirect to the customer —
saving the.cost: of whoiesalersJ„salesmen’s, and
retailers'profit. I only charge you 22/6 the box:
of 100 DIADEMAS, postage paid right to- your
address.
Send 22/6 to-day, and get the box: of Too-
DIADEMAS by return post. In ordering, say
whether-you like the mild,medium,, or.-strong-
grade, Elease add exchanger to country and;

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f I HE bush claims many lonely lives,
none lonelier perhaps than that of
the boundary-rider, who is posted on
the outskirts of a run to look after the
stock, to watch the tanks and waterholes,
and to keep the boundary and intermediate
fences in repair. To some temperaments
the life offers advantages. Only the flies by
day and the mosquitoes by night disturb
the peace ; only the cries of the birds and
the rustling of leaves break the quietude.
To the hatter by temperament this is an
ideal state of existence, and a man who
loves to talk, but likes to do all the talking
himself, is suited by a dog listener as well
as any other. Still, the average boundary-
rider is a hatter more by compulsion than
preference.
Sometimes he has a hut to live in ; more
often, outside the coastal divisions, he has
only a 6 x 8 tent, pitched in a lonely spot
where wood and water are close at hand.
The site is mostly chosen by the manager,
and he takes care that it is out of view of
frequented roads, since, on the one hand,
the place must be left unguarded through
the greater part of the day, and, on the
other, it is not desirable that the boundary-
rider’s frugal board should be taxed and his
meditations disturbed by passing travellers.
When the waterhole dries up or the feed
gets scarce, he shifts his residence to an-
other quarter. He has a mate occasionally
in drought time, when scrub has to be cut
for the sheep, and there is extra work at the
tanks pulling out the bogged animals and at-
tending to the weak ones.
His bill of fare is less changeable than
that of a hash-house. For breakfast he has
damper, mutton and brownie; for dinner he
has damper, mutton and brownie; for sup-
per he has damper, mutton and brownie.
And for Sunday dinner, having spent the
morning cooking, he has fresh damper, hot
mutton and new brownie.
With his tools and a well-filled waterbag
under his horse's neck, he starts out soon
after sunrise on his day’s round, and fre-
quently rides 40 or 50 miles before he re-
turns to camp. He rides one fence to-day,
driving the sheep off it and out of corners,
brushing the creeks, and splicing and strain-
ing broken wires. To-morrow he has a look
at the tanks and waterholes, pulls out
bogged sheep, and skins the dead ones. If
he comes upon a carcase that is too far
gone to skin, he plucks the dead wool and
carries it to camp in a bag. The next day
he rides another line of fence, and so on,
doing a little dingo-poisoning and scalp-
hunting at the same time. Now and again
he pilots a travelling mob through his part
of the run, which is about the only relief
he has from the dull monotony of his lonely
rides, where “the creaking of the saddle is a
dreary sound to hear.”
As a rule, he has no literary matter by
him to beguile the tardy hours, and conse-
quently knows nothing more of the world s
news than what he gleans from passing
travellers. He lives in a world of his own,
learning the' tracks of different animals, and
studying out better methods of trapping
dingoes. His conversation bristles with
grass and sheep and wire fences. Sometimes
he keeps one well-worn book to swap with,
and he occasionally gets a bundle of stale
papers from the homestead. There are _ ex-
ceptions, of course, but the boundary-rider
who is fond of reading is not favored by the
squatters, it being argued that an interest
in books and papers induces carelessness
and neglect of duty. Lacking the mental
stimulant of a book or paper in Ins com-
panionless evenings, he is impelled to dis-
course to inanimate things, to play patience,
or compose doggerel and aboriginalities.
One of the fraternity, whom I came to
know in the great central depression, was
called Jack the Hager. Most of his life
was cast in monotonous places, yet he was a
very entertaining old chap when he came
in ’from his hatterage and spent an evening
with the men in the station hut. He
could tell a good yarn. He could re-
cite too; but his best efforts were de-
livered when standing alone at his camp-
fire. Having a strident voice and a some-
what extravagant sense of dramatic atti-
tudes he once in a while astonished a be-
nighted wanderer who was bearing down on
his inviting blaze, and caused that person to
sheer off with cautious and accelerated step.
He told me how the boss had ridden on to
him one night when he was more than
ordinarily wound up. He had not been long
on the run then, and as yet was only plain
Jack Smith. It was election time, and being
interested in politics, Jack was putting up
for No Man’s Land. Standing beside a gid-
gee stump, on which stood a quart pot of
water and a pannikin, he orated impres-
sively, punctuating his speech with hand-
clappings and “hear-liears”; interjecting
and making sarcastic remarks, and wheeling
this way and that way to reply thereto.
Now and again he would point a thumb at
the wilga bush on Ms left, and tell the
mulga tree on his right that a gentleman
wanted to know what he was going to do
about the deceased wife’s sister; then,
having put in a general laugh, he would in-
form the audience how he intended to dis-
pose of that troublesome lady. He had
closed a successful meeting, carried a vote
of confidence in himself, and thanked the
chairman, when he was semi-paralysed by
hearing real applause and a real “hear-
hear” in the darkness beyond. It was the
boss. After that the candidate was known
as Jack the Rager. , .
Jack was a good example of his kind, per-
forming his duties with unfaltering regu-
larity, very exact, and scrupulously clean.
He had one way of doing each little job,
never altering his style. He took particular
care of his two or three horses, which were
consequently in good condition all the year
round. He put his saddle always in one
place, and when he brought his horse up in
the morning, he led him under the same
tree and hitched the bridle to the same
limb, though there were 20 others equally
good gnd quite as accessible. You saw his
fticjp for washing up hanging here, his tea
towel hanging there; and if you called six
months later you would find them hanging
in precisely the same places.
His bunk was simply a couple or bags
with two poles, resting on forks, run through
them; his safe was also a bag, suspended
lengthwise from the limb of a tree, with a
piece of board laid in for bottom, llis wash-
stand consisted of three stakes driven in the
ground, to hold a tin dish; and nailed to
the tree trunk alongside was a sardine tin
with a perforated bottom for soap. It , a
chance visitor happened to use it he was
told to cover it up when he had done, so
that the crows would not see it. Crows and
ants were two persistent items that Jack bad
always to Keep in mind. He cooked in the
open, wet and dry, his fireplace being merely
a couple of forks with a pole across them,
from which dangled a few wire hooks.
Before riding away in the morning, if no
one was left in charge, Jack would carefully
sweep over the bare patches around the
domicile with a brush broom. He departed
backwards, sweeping out his own tracks as
he went. On returning, he dismounted
several yards away, and approached his
door slowly, examining the ground tor evi-
dence of callers. Having entered and found
everything right, he went back by a cn-
cuitous route round the camp to his horse,
and let him go. If someone had called dur-
ing his absence the amount of tracking he
did would seem to any but a bushman a
waste of time and energy. He studied
closely the man’s tracks, the shape and size
of the horse’s hoofs, and, having ascer-
tained that the visitor came from the direc-
tion of the stony rise, that he dismounted
near the broken stump, stood at the door tor
awhile and looked round, and finally rode
away in the direction of Thompsons lank,
he worried his brain indefinitely _ trying to
solve the mystery of the person’s identity.
Sometimes he amused himself for Fours
at. a time trying to match the spiral columns
on the lids and bottom parts of wax-match
boxes; by playing peg-knife and other
“silly” games. If you came quietly on to
his camp at night, it was not unusual to
hear a heated discussion going on between
him and the fat lamp. He spoke in one
tone and voice for himself, and in another
for the fat lamp. As he tersely put it when
surprised, “Just a little argyment between
me an’ Slushy.” Sometimes they had a
row, and an imaginary fight, and Slushy
was kicked out of the tent. At other times
he sulked, as a result of the pig-headedness
of the other fellow, and wouldn’t speak to
the fat lamp for a week. He would even
“see him further” before he would light
him. Yet no one who knew this man would
say that he had a mental kink in his com-
position. Many men, and women, too, in
the bush talk to themselves, and have ex-
cited arguments with people who are not
present, expressing their opinions in a loud
voice, and saying in return what they think
the absent party would be likely to reply. I
can recall one good, old woman who in-
dulged in this way every washing day over
her tubs, beginning with, “Good day, Mrs.
—- —and going on at the rate of knots
until the final “Good-bye”—not forgetting
the invitation to call again; and when sur-
prised, she would drop down and laugh till
her face was aflame, and the tears ran
down her cheeks. Yet no one would call
these people eccentric. It is the craving for
conversation, for some one to talk to.
Jack was also given to card playing —left
hand against right. When it was right
hand’s deal, left passed or ordered it up.
If right was weak he turned it down and
left made it. The old man was careful to
hold the cards back to back, so that right
wouldn’t see what left had got. He became
awfully interested in the contest, too, which
was mostly for the championship of Bur-
ton’s Tank or Gidgee Creek, probably
for “the new girl down at Barney’s.”
He had a peculiar sun-dial, though what
he had constructed it for I don’t know, for
he was seldom there when its services would
be required. It consisted of stout pegs
stuck in the ground, at a radius of 10 feet,
round a tree. There were 10 of them, stand-
ing exactly one hour apart, so that the
shade, lying across the first at 8 a.m. would
be on the last at 5 p.m. A traveller with a
watch had camped with him one Sunday,
and between them they had evolved this
crude timekeeper. He complained, however,
that it required a lot of regulating, as it
didn’t accommodate itself to the changing
of seasons.
His almanacs were equally curious. For
the days of the month he had a tin and a
heap of pebbles. Every morning he dropped
one pebble in the tin until the pile was ex-
hausted, or, if the month contained but 80
days, till there was but one left. Then the
tin was emptied for next month. Thus,
whenever he was doubtful about the date, he
had only to count the pebbles in the tin.
Still, it wasn’t a satisfactory almanac. It
required another contrivance to keep a check
on it. This was a calendar showing the
days of the week. Jack at first used a cir-
cular board divided by grooves into seven
sections. A piece of deal, pivoting from a
nail in the centre, was shifted one section
each day. The only defect in this lay in the
fact that Jack was absent-minded at times.
He forgot to shift the bit of deal some
mornings, and seldom knew at night whether
he had shifted it or not. Having made
several mistakes in the date, he tried a new
idea. He made a big damper on Sunday
night, and marked it into seven sections,
each section being a day’s allowance. He
wouldn’t forget to eat, and every time he
picked the damper up the grooves would re-
mind him of the day.
Unfortunately, on the first Tuesday there
came a visitor with a ravenous appetite.
The host stinted himself that the hungry
one might be satisfied with the day’s sec-
tion. But he wasn’t. There were no houses
in that part, and he had come a long way
since breakfast, and didn’t lose sight of the
fact that he had far to go for supper. With
bulging eyes the host saw the knife cleaving
the boundary line. He fidgeted and coughed,
and made several irrelevant remarks. Still
the hungry man carved into the almanac.
At last he could stand it no longer.
“Stop, stop, for God’s sake!” he cried,
leaning across the bark table and grabbing
the remains. “Hang you,” he sank glaring
at it, “you’ve eaten Toosday an’ We’n’sday,
an’ now yer wanter slice the best o’ the
mornin’ off o’ Thursday !” . ■
The traveller left hurriedly, and Jack,
after watching him ferociously into the dis-
tance, proceeded to bake a new almanac.

MRS. MILLAR, who tells of.
the wonderful benefits derived ‘
from, Zam-Buk. \
THILE going about my
household duties one
day,” says Mrs. Mina
Millar, of 20 Little Queen Street,
Newtown, Sydney, “1 took off my
shoes to ease my feet, and hap=
pening to drag niy right foot along
the floor, a splinter about an inch
and a half long penetrated my foot
just under the big toe. 1 could
not get the splinter out. My foot
began to throb and swell, and near
the knee a huge lump formed
which 1 feared would break, be=
cause it was very near to some
varicose veins. The pain used to
shoot through my leg, causing me such
agony that 1 would break out in a pro=
fuse perspiration, my lips being parch=
ed and the tongue as though it were a
piece of leather in the mouth. Finally,
the inflammation spread from the foot
right up to the hip. 1 nearly went mad
with the agony, and 1 would not go
through it again for nothing.
“ 1 tried everything I could get, but
derived no ease from any of the treat=
ments and so=called remedies.
“When things were at their very worst I
decided to try Zam-Buk. having seen it ad-
vertised as a proved remedy for all sorts of
poisoned wounds. So I sent my son for a pot
of the Balm, and thoroughly soaked a ban-
dage with it and bound it round my foot and
leg. I also rubbed Zam-Buk very gently into
the lump on my knee, and, incredible as it
may seem, I got ease almost immediately.
The inflammation subsided like magic, and it
was simply wonderful the way the pain gradu-
ally grew less and less. Under the influence
of Zam-Buk, the cause of the whole trouble was extracted —a splinter of great size.
Day bv day now I was rapidly recovering, Zain-Buk doing its work in a splendid
fashion, and healing up the wound with clear, new, healthy skin. My leg assumed its
natural proportions, and I was able to get about again. ,
“I was strongly aclvisod to go into the hospital, hut, thanks to Zam-Buk, I am
saved that ordeal. Now we are all believers in Zam-Buk.”
Zam-Buk heals all cuts,
wounds and injuries, and is
a perfect remedy for skin
disease. Sold by all chem-
ists and stores at Is. 6d.

The Old Mile-Tree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OLD coach-road West, by Nor’-ward—
Old mile-tree by the track :
A dead branch pointing forward,
And a dead branch pointing back.
And still in clear-cut letters
On his hard heart he tells
The miles that were to fortune
And the miles from Bowenfels.
Old chief of Western timber !
A famous gum you’ve been.
Old mile-tree, I remember
When all your boughs were green.
There came three boyish lovers
a When golden days begun ;
There rode tnree boyish rovers
Towards the setting sun.
Ann Fortune smiled her fairest
And F’ate to these was kind —-
The truest, best and rarest,
The girls they'd left behind.
By the camp-fire’s dying ember <
They dreamed of love and gold ;
Old mile-tree, I remember
When all our hearts were bold.
And when the wrecks of those days
Were sadly drifting back,
There came a lonely swagman
Along the dusty track ;
And save for limbs that trembled—
For weak and ill was he —
Old mile-tree he resembled
The youngest of the three.
Beneath you, dark and lonely,
A wronged and broken man
He crouched, and sobbed as only
The strong, heart-broken can.
Tne darkness wrapped the timber,
The stars seemed dark o’erhead —
Old mile-tree I remember
When all green leaves seem dead.

HENRY LAWSON.
“The Gun.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FLEMING and Molloy were disconso-
late. They had done in their
cheques a week ago at Riley’s Flat
-—lO miles behind —and were making for the
Outback sheds. An hour’s serious reflection
brought them no inspiration as to how they
were to bluff a drink out of a town wherein
they hadn’t spent a bean. In their despera-
tion they cursed Fate, and publicans, and
the Universe in general.
Then The Gun happened along. The
Gun carried a very small swag—quite an
amateur affair—and his complexion was
pale and pretty.
He threw his swag on the ground in front
of the embittered pair, and opened in quite
a friendly manner with, “G’day, mates.”
Fie meant to be nonchalant; but it was
obviously forced. The shearers of 10 sea-
sons picked the city novice at once, and
gave him no encouragement.
“It’s a rotten day, ain’t it? Gor’struth,
it’s enough to drive a fellow balmy—no
blanky work—l ain't done a damn thing for
three weeks.”
' Blime! I should ’a’ thought you'd just
left a job of smashing blue metal—with your
’ands —be the look o’ them,” interrupted
the satirical Fleming. The Gun’s hands
were smooth and white.
He proceeded, though not quite so confi-
dently : “It’s this way, mates. I haven’t
had a meal, or even a beer, for 48 hours —-
and if yous blokes could part a deener to a
mate that’s right up against it”
“Turn that down, damn you—d’ye take us
for a couple of lambs? How long have you,
been on the track—with that!” pointing
scornfully at the telltale “Matilda.”
“Oh, well, it’s all right, boys—you've got
my strength. But have you got a drink?
My throat’s as dry as a brick in the floor of
Hell —with the blasted dust and thirst.”
“We’ve got nothing; we want a drink our-
selves, and want it damn bad, too. What’s
your game, anyhow?” asked Fleming.
“Well, it’s no use putting up jokes—
you’re no dunce. I’m a city gun—had to
get out of it —and I’m right up against it,”
candidly answered Cox. There was a pause.
Then:
“Look here, boys, I’m going to leave my
luggage with you—wait here till I come
back. I’m going to look round this town,
and, if there are any cheap drinks around,
you’re in it.”
He took their compliance for granted,
and walked off straight away. In about an
hour he returned. “It’s all right, boys ! Now
if you do what I tell you, I’ll give you one
good night. You’ll have to be away from
here in the morning good and early; but I
guess we’ll enjoy ourselves to-night, any-
how.”
“What’s your game, anyhow?” demanded
the suspicious Molloy.
“That’s all right,” answered The Gun.
“I’m not out to take you down, or I wouldn’t
have told you quite so much. You do just
what I tell you. of all, we will have
to get a fairly decent rig-out from the three
swags. I’ve got some linen and a swagger
pair of boots in that kit, also a shaving out-
fit—you’ll have to do the rest.” The confi-
dent geniality of The Gun carried the day,
and Fleming and Molloy caught some of his
light-heartedness. In a quarter of an hour
he was transformed into quite a respectable
person.
“Yes, yes—that’ll do nicely. Now there
are two pubs in this town —the Shamrock,
kept by a Dago named Murphy, and a
better-class one. Never mind that. Go to
Murphy’s, and ask if Mr. Cox, the contrac-
tor, has arrived yet. They are building a
bridge in this town in a day or two, and a
fellow named Cox has the contract. Tumble?
Shove now, and leave the rest to me. Hold
on-—say something about his stables, he’s
proud of them.”
Business was dull at the Shamrock. Mur-
phy leant his bare folded arms on the coun-
ter and abstractedly watched two roosters
fighting in the middle of the road in front of
his doorway. Two men with swags entered.
“Good dav. boss.”
“Good day, min.”
“Is Mr. Cox here?”
“He is not.”
Fleming turned to Molloy and muttered
something in a disappointed undertone. They
threw themselves disconsolately down on the
form in the bar, and were moody and silent.
“Anything I can do for you, min?”
“Well, the fact is, boss, we’ve got no
money—we’re going to work about here, and
we had to meet Mr. Cox, the contractor” —
rising and going towards the door.
“Hould on, min. Mr. Cox, the contrac-
tor. 1 don t know av him at all.. . Cox .. .
Cox .. . Oh! is that the man that’s goin’ to
build the bridge?”
“Yes, boss, that’s him —we had to meet
him.”
“Well, now, don’t he in a hurry, min.
Sit down. Won’t ye have a dhrink now?”
"Well, as I said, Mr. Murphy, we’re
broke.”
“That’s all right; have wan with me.”
Murphy shouted smilefully. “An’ is Mr.
Cox goin’ to stay here, min—did he tell ye
t’meet him at my place?”
“Yes, Mr. Murphy, lie said he heard you
had good stables”
“Faith an’ I hev. Whoever tould him
that knew the Shamrock stablin’ —hev an-
other dhrink, b’ys ; ye must be thirsty afther
yer walk. That’s right—l s’pose I'll be
seein’ ye on pav-night? Good-day, sor,” as
The Gun walked in. ,
“Ha, Mr. Murphy, I presume?”
“That’s my name, sorr.”
“I thought I had come to the right place.
A little late. Hullo, men ; you got here be-
fore me, did you—why, what the devil —did
you walk?”
“Well, Mr. Cox,” answered Fleming,
“after we finished that last job we went a
bit wild and got cleaned out.”
“Well, why the devil didn’t you see me?
Don't you do that sort of thing again. Men,
you’ve been working long enough for me
now to know that I wouldn’t see you stuck
like that —surely.”
Mr. Cox seemed rather more pained than
angry.
“I believe you have some good stabling
here, Mr. Murphy. The horses will be
along in a day or two, and I was directed
to look at yours. I’ve taken a contract to
build a bridge here.”
“Indade, thin, I have, Mr. Cox; I'm sure
you’ll he plazed wid ’em. But won’t ye
have a taste, sorr; the min are just havin’
wan. I’m sure y’ must want one afther yer
journey.”
“Oh, well, Murphy—l—er—don’t usually
drink with —well, you know ; but —well, I
will! Xes, Murphy, I’ll have a whisky.”
Murphy produced the best bottle and
pushed it over. “And a rale good dhrop of
stuffy you’ll find it, sorr.”
“Yes, yes, Murphy; it is a good drop of
stuff, it is indeed —we’d better have another.
What is it, boys? By. the way, Murphy, I
haven’t any loose change—l sent a draft on
to the bank here, and of course it’s closed.
But if you’ll just give me a pen and ink”-
“That’s all right, Mr. Cox—that's all
right. Don't you worry about that; sure
the mornin’ll be plinty of time.”
“All right, Murphy; just as you please.
Yes, whisky again. Have one yourself,
Murphy.”
“Thank ye, Mr. Cox, I will. Well, b’ys,
it’s the dahm good boss yez hev. The minit
ye put yer head inside the dure, . sez I
t’ meself: ‘That’s the malm to build our
bridge —he’s the sort for moi money’; and
it’s dahm seldom Dan Murphy makes a mis-
take in pickin’ a mahn, sorr!”
“Well, I’ve done some pretty good work
in my time, Murphy, and I hope to satisfy
the Golden Valley people. But; we’ll have
another whisky. Come, boys. Don’t forget
your own Murphy. By the way, I suppose
we—er—l can get some tea in about an
hour. You’d better fix the men up with a
meal, too, to-night, Murphy. I’ll see about
provisions to-morrow.”
Murphy left the bar to call “Bridget,” and
The Gun was overjoyed to hear some hurried
instructions in which a “couple of fowls”
figured.
Murphy returned to the bar, and, after a
few more drinks, Mr. Cox and “the min”
were shown to the dining-room, the latter, of
course, beipg placed at a respectful distance
from the boss. After tea, Mr. Cox saun-
tered to the front door with the obvious in-
tention of taking a stroll.
“Any places of interest about here, Mur-
phy? I think I’ll have a walk. By the
way, are there any otner hotels in the
town ?”
Now this was just what Murphy was
afraid of; Mr. Cox mustn’t visit his rival’s
drinkery.
“Well, Mr. Cox, I don’t think you’d find
the town very interestin’, and there is wan
other pub, but ’tis not a place for the likes
of you at all, at all. How wud ye like a
quiet little game of cards now ? Say euchre
or Forty Foives —’twould pass the evenin’
pleasant for ye.”
“Well,” said The Gun doubtfullv, “I don’t
particularly care for it; but as there’s
nothing else to do, I don't mind if you can
make up a four —a single-handed game is so
monotonous and uninteresting.”
“Sure, what about the min, Mr. Cox?”
“Oh, no, Murphy ; I never play cards with
the men .. . but. .. oh, I don’t know —there
are none of the other men here yet, and
these are two deuced decent fellows. Yes,
just for once I will have a game with them.
But mind, Murphy, it’s not to cost them
anything. If they lose, the loss is mine—-
understand that. Don't charge them with
any drink.”
“All right, sorr; and I must say, Mr. Cox,
that you’re a damned gintleman—and those
same min are lucky in havin’ such a boss.”
The cards were produced, and the four had
a really purple night. Murphy enjoyed him-
self as well as anybody, and congratulated
himself on the establishment of such a splen-
did footing with Mr. Cox and the first of the
“min” to arrive on the job. The card partv
lasted till 2 a.m., when Fleming and Molloy
left for their camp, hilariously drunk, and
Murphy obsequiously showed The Gun to
his room.
Next morning Murphy rose early in
order to be on deck to shout a brandy and
soda for Mr. Cox before breakfast.
As The Gun had not put in an appear-
ance by 10 o’clock he told Bridget to tap at;
his door and ask him if there was anything
he would like. Bridget returned to say the
gintleman didn’t answer.
“Sure,” thought Murphy, “I’ll take him up
a brandy and soda and wake him—he’ll be
wantin’ to go to the bank.”
Murphy tapped gently at the bedroom
door.
“Are you awake, Mr. Cox?” No response.
A little louder- —“Mr. Cox !” Still no an-
swer. Murphy rapped loudly: “Mr. Cox!
Mr. Cox!! Well, he certainly do sleep
heavy. I’ll open the d00r.”... .The Gun
was gone.
For a moment —only a moment —Murphy
was speechless. Then the people down-
stairs heard one ear-splitting yell that fairly
raised the dust from the floor of the house.
A human earthquake shot into the bar and
danced a raging war dance that would put a
blood-thirsty Zulu,to. shame.
