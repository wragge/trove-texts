BUCKINGHAM PAEK ESTATE,
MEDLOW (Blue Mountains).
This charming Estate has its Railway Platform almost
adjoining, and its level land proves it to be eminently
adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to have
lavished all h§r varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PARK,
which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKED
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large—from 100 up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no liner Residential Land on the Mountains.
. The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-

If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore

which I will at once reply, explaining the nature of bis
complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Suarantes a Permanent and Complete Cure in every case I undertake.
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some lime I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of investigating the causes of Nervous Diseases and
became perfectly acquainted with the most approved scientific and successful methods of affecting their cure.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably*
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re*
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe, lie has devoted a life*
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly invest!,
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with those widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hh
patients, ho has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind!

gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in

wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in

BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
YOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their eases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 1.0,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. AU

DR KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OP THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY PAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
SETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
ISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IF THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY, THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IF NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OF OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM.

THE BOOK WILL ALSO

THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OS CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR KELLY'S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1891.
Single-tax alias Confiscation.
Whenever “the creature Protection'’ begins
to loom on the New South Wales political
horizon, then does the Single-tax League
gird up its brains for the fray, and shove its
nostrum to the front. Then, too, do the
Sydney D.T. and the S.M. Herald, and the
rest of the shoddy press, begin to boom
Henry George’s doctrines ; and the theme
of their tirade is that the country should
give up Protection, and whoop instead for
the combined elements of Land Nationalisa-
tion and Foreign-trade. They never do any-
thing to bring the Single-tax policy any
nearer. They never even scream for that great
doctrine, except when Protection seems close
at hand, and then they applaud the noble
theory of a public revenue derived solely from
the land, and thereby induce the washy en-
thusiasts of the League to roll up and save
the importing interest from destruction.
And when they do this, and the danger is
thereby averted for the time, the Single-tax
gospel is forgotten, and the Foreign-trade
pi ess drops that creed in the waste-paper-
basket of oblivion, until it wants to make use
of its apostles at yet another political crisis.
Whereupon it cheers once more for the creed
of Henry George ; and the boneless, spine-
less, unreasoning fanatics whom it borrowed
and used and then threw overboard, roll up
again, to be used for Foreign-trade purposes
and thrown overboard as before.
i. # # *
! This policy is just now again in full
blast. With the advent of the Dibbs
Ministry, Protection is looming very near
at hand, and, as usual, the Telegraph
pnd the S.IVL Herald, and the Foreign-
trade party in general, all rise to scream for
the Single-tax gospel, in order to head off
the attack on the great importing monopoly.
None of them ever did or ever will do any-
thing to bring that reform about. No solitary
member of the Foreign-trade party desires
to see it come in his lifetime, or in that of
the most remote of his descendants. For
the Single-tax policy spells absolute ruin to
the land-owner ; and every individual who
has got money invested in freehold or lease-
hold property, in bank shares, building
Society shares, land companies, or any other
form of speculation even remotely connected
with land, will die in the last ditch before
golden age begins. The M‘Millans
and the Burdekiks and the rest of the
Foreign-trade capitalists, who vaguely profess
to sympathise with the great movement, will
fight behind a barricade, armed with guns
and hatchets, and the Herald and the Tele-
graph will call out the entire staff down to
the office-boy and the char-lady, and “ rcvo-
lushe ” in the highways when the Single-tax
fs really coming ; and even three-fourths of
the League itself will rather fill Sydney with
massacre than have any Single-tax at all.
For even Protection will not be one-tenth as
destructive to the rich monopolists of
Parke, s’ following as tho kind of Land
Nationalisation they profess to long for, and,
therefore, when tho fanatics of tlic League
prop up tho Foreign-trade interest under
the impression that the Foreign-trade in-
terest will prop them up in return, they
show a lamentable want of ordinary intelli-
gence. If they expected the Pope to go
forth and scream honestly and conscien-
tiously in an Orange procession, they would
thereby show themselves at least a shade less
ridiculous and less void of brains than they
are just now.

At the present moment the Dibbs Ministry
proposes the adoption of. Protection as the
only means of saving the province from irre-
deemable insolvency. It is not expected to
yield any direct increase of revenue, for New
South Wales already pays as much under
its alleged “ Freetrade tariff ” as it is likely
to do under the most stringent system of
Protection ; but it will cause a general
revival of prosperity, and thereby bring about
an improvement in every branch of revenue.
Therefore, when the Single-tax League, and
the political party which drags the League
behind it, demand that revenue should bo
obtained from the land instead of from the
Custom-house, and that all taxation, except-
ing the land-tax, should be abolished, it is
only reasonable to ask that they should sub-
mit full particulars of their scheme. So far,
the League has never once gone into particu-
lars. It is a hazy organisation which deals
in hazy generalities. It is too weak or too
ignorant or too badly scared to define its
own programme. It demands that all the
revenue should be derived directly from the
land, but it never dares to face the conse-
quences of its own policy ; and it urges the
Dibbs Cabinet to do a thing which can only
be accomplished by bold, naked, and utterly
remorseless confiscation ; yet it lacks the
courage to preach confiscation on its own
responsibility. The Herald and the Tele-
grarh and the Foreign-trade press at large,
and the Single-tax leaguers in general have
all risen within the last few' days to denounce
the new Ministry for adopting Protectionist
instead of Single-tax principles, yet not
one of them has had the common
honesty to point out that if the Govern-
ment did adopt these vaunted princi-
ples, then it must steal in one act the
hard-worked agriculturist’s farm, and the
workman’s garden, and the squatter’s station,
and pay not one solitary cent of compensa-
tion to any one of them. And now many
ignorant individuals want to vote against the
Dibbs Government for not doing according
to the noble principles of the Telegraph and
the other papers ; yet if the Government
had acted according to these principles, the
same people would presently have desired to
hang the Dibbs Cabinet on the most adjacent
lamp-post.
* * *
The entire annual “ unimproved ” value of
all the lands of New South Wales, excepting
those unsold and unoccupied lands which
bring in no rent whatever, are, according to
Mr. Coghlan, a trifle less than £10,000,000
per annum. The entire expenditure of the
Government is also- a trifle less than
£10,000,000 per annum. Consequently, the
two items suit each other to perfection. The
idea of the League is that the rents of the
lands of the province should pay all the
expenses of Government, and there are just
sufficient of them to do it. Therefore, if the
State seizes upon all the lands of New South
Wales, and bounces out the present owners
without any compensation whatever, it will
just get enough, and no more than enough,
to run the country on the Single-tax plan.
If it pays compensation, how'ever, the scheme
will yield no present profit whatever. For, in
that case, the Government would have to
borrow, at least, £200,000,000 to buy out the
present owners, so as to nationalise the land
on a fair basis ; and supposing that gigantic
sum were obtained at 5 per cent. —which,
considering its magnitude, is utterly impos-
sible—the national accounts would stand
thus :
Expenditure.
Ordinary expenses of State as at present .. £10,000,000
Interest on loan for compensation of land-
holders .. .. .. 10,000,000
£20,000,000
Revenue.
sents5 ents v,. ■ • • ■ • • - £10,000,000
Customs duties, &c., as at present .. 10,000,000
£20,000,000
Therefore, if the present land-owners, many
of whom have bought their land from the
State, and paid for it by much toil—by
means, in fact, of their life-savings— are to
be compensated, instead of plundered by a
gigantic system of spoliation, there will be
exactly the same necessity for customs’
duties after the land is nationalised as there
is at the present moment.
* * *
It is because the Single-tax League has
never had the courage to face this problem,
but chooses to stand in the way of an honest
and practicable method of securing to the
State all unearned increment in the price of
land, that The Bulletix, denounces it as a
useless and insincere combination. For it
travels entirely on the glorious advantages to
be gained after the land has returned to the
possession of the State, and it poses as a
public benefactor and gains much applause
from the unthinking multitude by demanding
that the State should possess the land ; but
it always leaves to somebody else the odium
of bringing its millennium about. It
virulently abuses the new Protectionist
Government for not achieving a reform
which can only be achieved by a hideou 8
and utterly remorseless process of plun-
dering, but it never once dares to openly
and in as many words recommend that
process. There is a certain glorious
end to bo gained by utterly repulsive
means, and the League wants to let someone
else provide the means while it takes credit
for the end. And the /Herald and the
Telegraph and the Foreign-trade party in
general—which have attempted absolutely
nothing to bring the great reform about—
now howl bitterly because the Dices Govern-
ment does not do what they have also left
undone. If that Government could be in-
duced to attempt such a thing the mere fact
that the attempt was made by a Protectionist
Cabinet would make Protection impossible
for 20 years to come, and the instant the effort
was made the Foreign-trade press would
demand that the heads of the new Ministers
should be torn off by a furious mob, and
deposited on the Herald’s doorstep. It
screams because its opponents refuse to com-
mit suicide, but it has no visible intention of
suiciding itself by following out its own pro-
gramme.
* * *
The reason why the Foreign-trade party
does not want the Single-tax system— de-
spite the manner in which it uses the Single-
tax League for its own ends—is sufficiently
obvious. For if that system were adopted
then Sir Daniel Cooper would be stone-
broke, and Burdekin would be penniless,
and Bruce Smith would be burst up.
Then, too, the land on which the Herald
and Telegraph offices are built would be
forfeited ; and the great A.M.P. Society
would vanish into thin air, for most of its
money is invested in land and mortgages, all
of which would become of no value ; and the
big Colonial Mutual office, and the National
Mutual, and the Australian Widows’ Fund
would all explode for the same reason, and
all the people who have trusted to these
offices for a provision for their families would
be left in the lurch. Then, too, all the
building societies in which the poor man’s
little pile is planted would go bankrupt, for
their assets are almost all in land, and the
land would be confiscated by the State ; and
the savings-banks and the banks of issue
would collapse together ; and everything
would be chaos. The Foreign-trade party
wants no Single-tax policy ; and though
it uses the League as a convenient tool with
which to undermine Protection, it would
rise up and secretly murder the members of
that organisation in the night if there Avas
the slightest danger of their great scheme
ever becoming anything more than an empty
Avar-whoop and a convenient advertisement.
* * #
The Bulletin was a consistent advocate
of Land Nationalisation before the imbecile
Single-tax League Avas invented, and it will
still advocate it when that foolish organisa-
tion is buried and forgotten. But Land
Nationalisation is neither a Freetrade nor a
Protectionist policy, and it cannot be used
to bolster up any fiscal creed whatever.
Under its provisions the State Avill honestly
re-purchase—most probably by giving the
owners debentures in payment—the °land
which it sold in the past, and will thereafter
abolish all private ownership. This process
Avill yield no immediate return, for what (he
State receives in rent it will pay out in
interest, but all future increase of value will
be the property of the nation. In the mean-
time, however, the necessity for revenue
will remain just the same Avith Land
Nationalisation as Avithout it, and even when
a vast income has grown up Avhich will
render all ordinary taxation superfluous, the
demand for a Protective tariff will still exist.
No country can live on Land Nationalisation
alone ; if Asiatic and cheap European pro-
ducts are admitted free, then Avages will sink
to the Asiatic or cheap European level just
the same, Avhether the land belongs to the
State or to the private landlord. But
the Single - tax League has chosen to
boom Land Nationalisation as a Freetrade
policy. It demands that all taxation
shall be abolished save the land-tax only,
and to do this the State must seize upon all
the rent of all the land, which is robbery
pure and simple. There is no possibility of
compensation, for then the Government
Avould require to retain all the existing
sources of revenue to pay interest on its
gigantic debt, and in that case there Avould
be no Single-tax, but just the same number
of taxes that there are at present. I here-
fore, if the Single-tax League possesses the
courage of its convictions, it will honestly
preach direct confiscation and take the con-
sequences, Avhatever they may be. At pre-
sent it is carrying on a crusade against the
Protectionist Government because it will not
do that which the League lacks the courage
even to say, and the position is a despicable
one for any league to occupy.
Subpœenæring the Lord.
Has the present Dibbs Ministry a sufficient sense
of justice, and courage enough to promptly
acknowledge and atone, as far as now may be,
for the ghastly error committed in regard to
the Mount Rennie case a few years ago?
Henry Copeland, Minister for Lands, stood up
the other evening in the New South Wales
Assembly to justify Governor Cakinoton’s
share in the blasphemy against justice which
terminated in the strangling of four boys found
guilty on the oath of a complaisant little street-
marcher, backed up by the testimony of two
men— Stanley, since distinguished as the
utterer of a forged cheque; and Smith, a dis-
graced jockey, now doing penal servitude for
arson. When Mr. Copeland spoke he spoke
not for Gov, Carinqton alone, but he held a
brief for himself. Said he, with gore-champing
jaws:— 1 ®
I find, in the 20th chapter of Judges, that, for ravishing
one woman, no less than 22,000 of the Children of Israef
were, by direction of the Lord, slain in one day • is ntii
wore slain on the second day; and, on the third fin,,
25,000 of the Children of Benjamin were slain ; making
altogether 65,000 of the Jewish people slain, by direction
of the Lord, because one woman was ravished.
In other words, Mr. Henry Copeland would
saddle the Lokd with the perpetration of the
Mount Rennie gallows-murders. Was the
Lord also responsible for the damnable brutali-
ties pf their trial, for the shameless parody on
human justice that staked the lives of youths
against the physical endurance of counsel and
jurors, with the make-weight thrown in of the
personal convenience of the Judge ? Can Cope-
land, who was then a Minister of the Crown
even with the help of the Lokd get
over the hideous central facts of the case?
Putting aside all formed opinions of innocence
or guilt—was the trial of the Mount Rennie
scapegoats a fair one? Was it not a blood-
seeking insult to the democracy ? Consider the
following facts only—wc ask members to follow
us closely here—to the exclusion of all others
and give an answer:—The Court commenced
the case at 10 o’clock on a Monday morning
sitting right on till about 9.30 in the evening-
on Tuesday it sat from 9 a.m. till past 11.30
P-m. ; on Wednesday (a night on which pre-
siding Judge Windeyek dined with Sir Robert
Fowler, an alleged “distinguished visitor’’from
Hingland) it sat from 9 a.m. till only 7 p, m .
on Thursday, ditto (his Honor on this night
dining at Government House in company with
the same potentate) ; on Friday-oura-Saturday
the Court sat right on from nine o'clock on
Friday morning until after four a.m. on Satur-
day viorning, the Judge alleging that he did
not wish to keep the jury locked up over the
Sunday (!) ; the Court then again met at nine
a.m. on the, same day (!), the Judge summed up
for ten solid hours, during which from time to
time some of the jurymen were comatose, and
the verdict which fed victims to the gallows
was given a little before the midnight that
ushered in the holy Sabbath. Mark how the
prisoners’ counsel were placed. Had they done
more than record their protest against the
enforced exhaustion of all concerned as being
monstrous, they would have provoked the ill-
will of jurymen who had been locked up every
night for a week, and who would have
debited counsel for the defence with being the
unwarranted cause of their incarceration over
Sunday. Do these circumstances strike Cope-
land as having been “by direction of the
Lord ” ? If he takes that line of argument, he
has a wide range of atrocities to applaud, ’ It
will be within his rule to excuse—nay, to advo-
cate—as justifiable concomitants of war, but-
cheries similar to those perpetrated by the
Israelites on the boy-captives of Midian,
besides the personal appropriation,
and enslavement of the maidens, “ by direction
ot the Lord f per the mouth of Moses ; or like
to the utter destruction of the subjects of Og,
King of Bashan, “ men, women, and children ” ;
or the burning of Jericho and the massacre of
its inhabitants, “ both man and woman, young
and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass. with the
edge of the sword ” ; or the similar devilry at
Ai and the hanging of its king, and five other
kings, all military prisoners; and—but why con-
tinue the list of deeds of supersatanic rapine and
wholesale atrocities committed by the victorious
fiends who wiped out the Canaaniter, “ by
direction of the Lord ” ? Mr. Copeland ought
to carry his bull-headed, Yorkshire-bred
scriptural enthusiasm further, and bring in
bills to stone to death adulterous women ;to
enforce the quittance of “ an eye for an eye and
a tooth for a tooth ”; for the legalisation of
slavery, “as directed by the Lord”; for the
recognition of polygamy‘and harems of concu-
bines ; and many other sweet and ancient
practices. He didn’t, moreover, give the pre-
liminary passages of the incident in which his
heart found justification for the Mount Rennie
gallows-massacre ; he ought to have told how a
pious Israelite offered his own virgin daughter
as a sacrifice to the lewdness of the “sons of
Belial, and he might have founded thereupon
a theme on which to lavish all the laudation
due to a strictly law-conforming religiqnist,
who was also an inhumanly unnatural father.
Also, he might have made a point of the fact
that, whereas the champions of the ravishers,
the children of Benjamin, only lost 25,000
men, the revengers of outraged virtue, on their
side, lost 40,000—a proportion which ought to
be a lesson to immoderate zeal in bloodthirsti-
ness. Mr. Copeland does not shine in his
assumption of legal partnership with the Lord.
Unless the Dibbs Ministry do something for
the remaining Mount Rennie miserables, or
show cause—which we challenge them to do-
why something should not be done, they will
yet lose a lot of votes in a close division on
which their political life depends. They were
responsible for the Soudan act of brigandage,
and the public are now just as ashamed of the
legal massacre perpetrated under Dibbs and
Co.’s mgis, as it is at the Australian invasion
of the Soudan.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Nautical Sky-Pilots.
Dear Bulletin, —
The man who objects to another man’s fad, when it is
thrust upon him, is distinctly justified.—Sydney Bulletin,
October 30, 1891.
The foisting of public religious services, generally
Church of England, by a few cranks upon un-
fortunate and unsuspecting passengers at sea, 1
is becoming an intolerable nuisance. As a rule,
the chief offender is a bigoted captain who has
mistaken his vocation, and is fond of filling up
unwilling yet helpless passengers—for it would
be considered bad form to object publicly —
with his own dreary ctbgmas and dissertations.
Why should people of various sects, likewise
the constantly-swelling numbers who belong to
no sect whatever, be subjected, nolens volens, to
a discourse from a narrow-minded seaman or
clergyman, or from some smug layman who
loves to show off? In one mail steamer


I travelled by, there was a Church of England
service, in the first-class saloon, every morn-
ing at 11. On Sundays there were two—
at 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. The saloon was mono-
polised for the time being by this joyous sect,
and you had either to attend their service or
clear out. An exasperated passenger at last
posted a notice upon the companion-way board,
requesting “that those who wished to pray,
would not interfere with those who wanted to
read or write ; and, further, that the ship
Would not be turned into a floating church.”
This was rough, but the impervious preacher
went on just the same. One Sunday evening
a disturbance took place in the second
saloon. The Church of England service
was being performed there, and a young man
refused to leave off writing, but removed his
materials out of the way to the far end table.
At the conclusion of the services the intolerant
devotees, fresh from their orisons, cordially
hissed him. Several first-class passengers in
the smoking-room, myself among the number,
went to see what the matter was, and upon my
expressing an opinion that the young man was
fully justified some fanatics almost tore the
coat off my back. For an instance near home,
I was travelling recently from Wellington
(M.L.) on a rough Sunday evening, 24 hours
out, with seven-eighths of the passengers pro-
strated with sea-sickness in their bunks, and
trying to get a little sleep. Yet the captain
waded through the service, as usual, and threw
in a long and incoherent exhortation of his own,
and as his stentorian voice roused up one weary
invalid after another, the spoken and unspoken
curses that were heaped on his head were
enough to sink any ordinary preacher. Rational
freethinkers, agnostics, and others of advanced
thought (or, if you like, diseased thought—for
this isn’t an essay on religion, but on manners)
almost always respect the feelings and the pre-
judices of conscientiously religious people, hold-
ing that none can say dogmatically what
theories are right or vice versa, but the aggra-
vated and incurable soi-disant Christain never
does. What I would suggest is, that a ballot
should be taken among the passengers to decide
if there should be Sunday service on board,
and if so, of what denomination —though
even this idea would be written down
as blasphemy by many Christians I know.
Meanwhile, many passengers to and from
Europe, with the view of escaping the dreadful
British Sunday-at-sea, are patronising the
French and German steamers,' where they
know rational treatment can be depended upon.
In the average British steamer a Jew or an
agnostic or a Catholic must either sit and listen
every Sunday to doctrines that he repudiates,
or else go overboard—it is impossible to get out
of range by any other means. It is not much
that they ask—only that no captain, or other
fanatic, should be allowed to seize them in the
middle of the Pacific, and preach them to death
where there is no room for escape. —Yours,
&c., J.B.
[This quite fits in with the experience of many people.
“J.B.’s” grievance is a genuine one. The Church of
England appears to be Established on boaid some of the
mail-steamers.—Ed. B.]

Unproductive Works.
New South Wales Premier Dibes’ promise to
construct unproductive public works for the
future out of revenue, instead of out of loan-
moneys, has raised a yell of indignation in the
columns of the Sydney Daily Telegraph.
There is nothing distinctly objectionable about
the idea of borrowing only for works that will
pay expenses ; it is admittedly a thing that
ought to have been done from the beginning,
and in any case the simple policy of having a
high old time to-day and leaving the bill to
posterity is about played out; but the frantic
Foreign-trade paper feels that the proposal
is a reflection on Parkes’s past doings, and, any-
how, everything that Dibes says or does must
be jumped on as a matter of principle. fhere-
fore, it gets up with a shriek to declare that no
money has ever been spent on unproductive
works in New South Wales, which assertion is
a large order, and shows that the paper that
makes it is capable of asserting anything. Up
to date the Frectrade province has sunk
£775,000 of British money on defence-works,
and if its moth-eaten fortifications and tottering
ramparts are a reproductive or saleable asset,
or a thing that pays any sort of dividend, then
it would be interesting to know where the
dividend comes from. Another £600,000 of
borrowed cash has gone in roads and bridges ;
they yield no profits, and they are also unsale-
able, for no one can tear up a road and trade it
off bv auction. They were constructed
in a great measure to enhance the value
of public lands, and when the value was
enhanced the Foreign-trade Governments
of the past sold the lands and “ blewecl
the proceeds royally, and left the Dill
for the roads and bridges unpaid. About
£400,000 more went in immigration —in import-
ing cheap paupers and human refuse ; if this is
a reproductive item, then the dictionary has
gone mad and the British language is oft its
head. Two millions has been spent (most of it
foolishly) on impossible sand-barred harbours,
and on river improvements ; this item is merely
repairs to the highways of the country, and is
no more a reproductive asset than the filling in
of a hole in a road ; it yields no dividends, and
it isn’t saleable, for a harbour can’t be dug up
and put in the market. Another £1,600,000
has departed to pay for public buildings which
produce no returns whatever, and which can t
be realised upon unless the public departments
are to be fired into the middle of the street;
and nearly £3,000,000 additional has gone in
discounts and per-centages to financiers an
item which can no more be charged to loan ex-
penditure as a reproductive asset than can the
interest on the national debentures, for it is
merely a dead and irrecoverable loss, faking
everything into account, therefore, fully
£8,000,000 has been borrowed in New South
Wales for unproductive purposes, and the
reason why the blatant Telegraph complains
so bitterly is because .Premier Dibes promises
not to add any more to this unprofitable load.
No doubt, if Dibbs arose and stated in a bald-
headed way that he was going to borrow
largely for unprofitable works the Telegraph
would howl and travel around on its ear just
the same. For so ,r > time past that paper has
published twelve leading-articles per week
against the new Protectionist Government
which proposes to live within its income because
the borrowing game is “up”—and its excite-
ment is a truly awful thing to look at.

Wales’s Birthday.
Wales had a birthday last Monday, and the
British Empire celebrated the event in five
continents and several dozen islands, ’there
was nothing surprising in the fact of Wales
having a birthday ; every other man has one
just as regularly as he does. There was nothing
commendable about it, for the little heir-
apparent didn’t make his birthday. There was
no cause to whoop about it, either, for it only
meant that Wales was 12 months older and 12
months nearer being dead than he was last birth-
day, and it is unkind to celebrate over the fact
that any man is getting nearer to the dusty tomb.
Moreover Wales’s mother is Head of the
Church, and Wales himself, if he lives long
enough, will be Head of the Church in his turn,
and the Church is solid on the subject of hell ;
and if that institution is correct in its views
then that is still another reason why it is a
base and ungenerous thing to rejoice over the
heir apparent’s approaching decease from old
age. Meanwhile the embryo monarch is a
dreary spectacle, and not by any means a good
subject to rejoice about. He has one dismal
eye fixed on his unpaid bills, and the
other on a ballet-girl in tights. He never
said anything brilliant, or did anything
surprising. The monarchy lives on the memory
of the old, brawny, mail-clad kings of past
history, but when its traditions get hitched on
to a little man with a heavy jowl, and a mean-
ingless expression, and a big stomach, and a
bald-head, • and small, uncertain legs, and a
gambling-kit in his portmanteau, it is rough on
the ancient legend. The world believes a great
deal in glitter and show, and the king who
waves a sword in the front of the battle can
rouse a lot of enthusiasm, but it is hard
work to enthuse about the potentate who
only waves a fork at a dinner - or
a big trump at a card - party. Even
a new Shakespeare couldn’t raise a poenj
or a drama about British royalty now-
adays, for pie doesn’t lend itself to
dramatic effect. You can make a brilliant
tragedy out of the monarch who perishes on the
field of battle, but you can’t make any literary
effect out of the one who is in bed with gout
and varicose veins. The thing is as much out
of place as a bun would be if it were used as a
national standard; it is as incongruous as the
idea of an army rushing to battle with a wild
yell of “boiled ham!” as its war-cry. The
monarchy which rallies round a little, fat,
dismal person, with pig’s-eyes is doomed. All
the poetry and romance have gone out of it,
and the world wants poetry and romance. Its
ideas of what constitutes poetry may be limited,
but it wants the thing all the same. The ancient
church realised this fact ; it was watered by
the blood of the martyrs, and they looked poetic
at all events, therefore the Church prospered.
But if these old martyrs had died through over-
eating themselves, as the monarchy is dying
now, there would never have been any Church
worth mentioning at all. A course of vigorous
exercise, and a long series of Turkish baths,
might postpone the downfall of the Guelphs
by making them appear a shade more like what
fancy has painted a king to be, but even this is
only postponing the evil day. The House of
Brunswick is being shoved to destruction by its
own stomach, and its short, uncertain legs are
its death warrant.

Through All Eternity.
Rudyard Kipling, that brilliant literary man
from India, landed the other day on the coast
of Maori land, and straightway the “special
correspondent” of the Otago Witness went
forth and interviewed him. The following
remarks are part of the stuff with which the
visitor filled up the Witness man, and they
are memorable because they are the first words
which Kipling uttered in an official capacity
in the Southern Hemisphere. He had come
Hi,ooo miles and more, and his very first effort
on getting to land was to throw a hunk of
literature off his chest concerning the eternal
greatness of the awful British Empire :
“ England cannot colonise India,” he said. “ The pure
white race always dies out in three generations. I he
only chance of survival is intermarriage with the natives,
and then you t;ct a race that can stand the climate. The
pure Eii'dish blood cannot. India will always he hound
up with England. The colonies may grow into new
nations and separate in time, but India never.”
Think of that ! The Englishman dies out in
India in three generations, therefore, the con-
quering race can’t even get a footing there.
The only way is to make a hybrid nation, half
English, half Hindoo. These half-castes ate
born in India, and have Indian sympathies,
and intermarry with the native races, and they
know nothing of England, and care less but
all the same, India will belong to England for
ever and ever. For Rudyard Kipling, that
typical John Bull, has looked into futurity
far as human eye can see, and his
nation alone among the nations is going to
last for all time and all eternity. r lhe Last
Man is going to be an Englishman —that final
being who will stand his family umbrella up
against the blackened stars and the extinguished
sun, and hang his hat on the worm that never
dies, and keep his eye on the seraphim when
they suspend this old, dead, fire-blasted world
in th.e heavens to dry. He is a creature of
yesterday, a mere ephemeral insect, a fly stand-
ing on a leaf and giving advice to the Lord ,
his empire started just JOO years ago, and he
has already lost the richest half of it, and he
now dodders feebly on the half that remains,
and wails about his own everlastingness. Of
that remaining half, too, 75 per cent is prac-
tically gone, for Australia is so far on the road
to independence that she only receives orna-
mental Governors on sufferance, and Britain
dare not plant even one private soldier in this
land to show that it belongs to her ; and Canada
already talks freely of secession. The Musco-
vite, too, is looming very large at the
gates of India, and the Asiatic himself will
not remain subject for ever. Five times
already within the historic ages he has
swamped Europe, aiul half the men who now
call themselves Europeans are Asiatic con-
querors whose fathers ate up the original races,
and annexed their lands, and stole their
Avives and daughters, and generally took
over the inheritance of Japhet. But,
though the loss of one-half the empire may
reasonably suggest what is likely to become of
the other half, and though the great British
monarchy has been visibly falling to pieces ever
since that brief yesterday when it first began,
the faith of John Bull in his own eternal
durability is unshaken. He rises superior to
facts and dates and circumstances, and he opens
himself and lets his famous flag gush out of his
entrails at every possible opportunity. The
duration of his monarchy, compared to that of
the earth on which it stands, is as a grain of
sand beside a star ; he is a mere speck of dust
using bad language to a sun, but he is incapable
of realising his own smallness. The salutation
of the Egyptian people to their old Egyptian
kings was “ Pharaoh lives for ever;” the
whoop of the Englishman of to-day is “John
Bull lives for ever,” and he gets there just the
same. For nowadays the Pharaoh is dug out
of his grave and his remains are sold to a circus,
and where he has gone there John Bull will
go, and the learned African commentator of
8000 years hence will probably go blind with
looking through a microscope for Bull’s dust,
and will find it not.

A well-advertised “ Single - tax ” potentate,
William Affleck, writes to Sydney D.T. to
show how New T South Wales can get through
without Protection; and how it may yet
achieve that glorious destiny wdien its workers
must either accept wages on the Chinese or
European pauper scale—or else sec their indus-
tries extinguished by foreign competition :
Sir, — The newspapers report Mr. Lyne has given as a
reason why the Government will go to the Custom-house
instead of the land for revenue is the difficulty and loss
of time in collecting it. I do not think this a good
excuse, as it might be imposed to a certain extent without
any delay. Mix Cogolax has given out that the unim-
proved value of the alienated land of the colony in April
last, above one aero in extent, according to the census
was £205,000,C00. Let circulars bo issued from all the
lands offices ... to all those making their returns
by the census, taking their own value until a valuation
can be made, chanjimj 1 per cent fur a start, and we have
a revenue of £2,050,000 without any delay, as it could be
made payable by January 1 next. In the meantime
valuators could be appointed to value all the lands not
included in the return —viz., those lands under la. in
extent, which means city, town, and suburban lands, and
then the 1 per cent, tax could be assessed on these also.
. . . I think it can be seen by these few remarks Mr.
Lyxe’s excuse for not going to the lands for revci ue is
not a very substantial one. A land-tax we must have,
and the sooner the better, and if the new Ministry are
anxious to retain office they will lake the hint herein
given and never nlind tiro Custom-house, but begin at
once on the owner’s own value for a start.
Just so ! Then there will, we presume, be, a
little later on, no customs duties at all, and all
the revenue will come from the land. Then
the great wine-industry will collapse in one
act, and the brewing and distilling industry,
and the tobacco business, and the dairy produce
trade, for they are all kept up chiefly by Pro-
tection in an alleged Freetrade country. And
on top of this disaster there will be a charge of
1 per cent, per annum on the capital value of
land, equal to over £2O in every £lOO on the
annual rental, a tax which will come down with
a dull, sickening thud just when the country is
dying of too much Freetrade. And as this is only
“for a start,” the result will be immediate
panic, followed by the results to which
we have alluded elsewhere. Land National-
isation is coming right enough ; but no-
body save a remorseless idiot, with one cast-
iron fad, could suggest preparing for the change
by burying the national industries in general
ruin. Yet that is exactly what the single-tax
man wants, and ho wants it simply because his
dry-nurse, Henry George, lias told him to
want it.

As a hint to the New South Wales unemployed,
a Sydney D.T. writer remarks that nearly
£ll,OOO worth of sausage-skins are imported
yearly into New South Wales. The Sydney
slaughter-house offal, he points out, is thrown
away to make room for cheap, imported entrails
from other lands. Gracious benefactor ! TheNevv
South Wales workman is to support Foreign-
trade, give up all decent artisan-ship to the
people of distant countries, and then he is to
go to work cleaning pigs’ intestines and make
them into £ll,OOO worth of sausage-skins. New
South Wales under the Calico Jimmy regime
imports everything else, and, so far as we can
see, it might as well import the sausage-skins
as well. Why doesn’t the D.T. get excited
over some cleaner job than this ? If the province
isn’t to have Protection in the matter of rickety
Baldwin engines and things like that, it doesn't
want its offal protected. Or, at all events, it
doesn’t want to start by protecting offal. It
is just like a Foreign-trade paper to begin turn-
ing its coat by wanting to help the local in-
dustry in—pardon the plain Saxon—glorified
guts. The sort of country that the Sydney
D.T. syndicate wants is a country which lives
by cleaning tripe, while it buys everything
else ready-made.
The S.M. Herald, for some inscrutable reason,
allows one J. W. Hill to write in its columns
upon the tariff question. That individual is a
splendid type of the Foreign-trader of the
period. He begins, as usual, by a solid curse at
the Dibbs Government for wanting to bring in
Protection, and then he proceeds to tell that
combination exactly what it ought to do
instead ;
Why will the people not settle upon the land is surely
the question a solution of which would bring a peace and
plenty that would banish fiscal nostrums from us ? Is it
that young Australia is developing a new disease to be
known as terraphobia ? Then let us ship him off for some
of England’s sturdy yeomen. Is it the mania of Govern-
ments for centralising? Then let us insist upon a rigid
decentralisation. Is it that the land is too dear, or the
people have no money to start upon, or available land is
beyond the reach of cheap freights? Then why not give
the land rent free for long periods? There is surely
enough of it, lend the money at low rates and long terms.
The security on improvements and the property is good
enough, and if necessary, build them railways, the pro-
spective business would justify it. Why not do all this,
and more, if required, to settle the people upon the soil ?
In other words : (1) Reduce railway rates,
and thereby cut down the railway revenue
(which even now isn’t enough to pay interest
and expenses), and thus create another huge
shortage ; (2) give away the land free, and
thus extinguish the land revenue—these two
items alone will make a healthy additional
deficiency of about £2,000,000 per annum ;
(3) lend a lot of money—when there isn’t
any to lend —with no security, at low in-
terest, and lose both the principal and the
interest; (4) build more railways, when there
isn’t a cent to build them with, and also “ do
more if required.” Then go in for decentralisa-
tion. This is a large and blessed-sounding
word, and a vast number of politicians travel
on it and live on it, yet none of them ever
explain it much. In a general way, however,
it means that all the public offices shouldn’t be
concentrated in Sydney, but that about
£1,000,000 of Government premises should be
built all over the country, so that the work
may be scattered throughout the land. Truly
the world is choke-full of lunatics, and most of
them seem to write to the S.M, Herald.
The people of British Honduras, West Indies,
have curry com bed Lord Knutsforu the wrong
way. Honduras is imperially run by an “ Ad-
ministrator,’’ and the Legislature takes the
form of a Court, partly nominated and partly
elected. That Court recently decided that the
colony was not liable for the amount of a claim
sent in by a contractor. Knutsford insisted
that the claim should be paid. Whereupon the
elected members resigned, and the constitu-
encies declined to fill up the vacancies. Knuts-
ford ordered the Administrator to fill up the
places with nominees. Which was done.
The new Legislature imposed fresh taxes,
amongst other increases, raising the tobacco-tax
from 10 cents to 50 cents per pound. This put
the State “ tatur all on cend at getting biled,”
and public measures were taken accordingly.
Backed up by public subscriptions, a business
firm imported a lot of tobacco, paid the new duty
under protest, and then appealed to the Supreme
Civil Court. Chief Justice Anderson judicially
declared that all legislation passed by a Court
(meaning what Australians term “ the legisla-
ture ”) not strictly constituted according to
law— i. e., not composed partly of elected mem-
bers—was invalid. This judgment will pro-
bably be further referred to the Privy Council,
but, if that body correctly interprets the law,
it must be upheld. If not, still the Honduras
Custom House can’t very well enforce its tariff
in the interim. Knutsford has, meanwhile,
to call for a step-ladder to enable him to climb
down from his perch. Great Britain, with all
its vaunted power, cannot coerce its smallest
dependency against the will of the colonists.

Choice extract from a sermon by Rev. W.
Gray Dixon, of Warrnambool (Vic.) cursing
the principle of One-man-one-vote :
An Imperial Governor stood face to face with a mass
meeting of citizens. No ordinary Governor, and no
ordinary citizens. He represented Home, the mistress of
the world ; they represented Israel, the divinely-appointed
nation of free men. And the occasion, too, was no
ordinary occasion They were discussing a fellow-man,
whose personality everyone admitted to be phenomenal,
whose personality the civilised world has since acknow-
ledged to be co-equal with “ the great Gou Himself.”
Imperial authority on the one side, manhood suffrage on
the other—resultant, the destiny of “the Man who is
God.” Imperial authority nit ads for mercy, acquits of all
guilt; manhood suffrage cries for swift and utter punish-
ment. Imperial authority hesitates, asks for reasons;
but manhood suffrage, the more vehemently, if possible
the more unanimously, clamours tor vengeance. “ They
cried out the more, saying, ‘ Let Him be crucified. And
manhood suffrage prevails. Jesus is consigned to the
cross. The vote was a true vote. It was fully character-
istic, fully deliberate. It was the vote, not of a class,
but of a nation, and it was recorded in the broad
light of day, and with sufficient opportunity,
even urgently enforced, for reconsideration. In no
completer way could the will of mankind have been
learned that day— the will of mankind in its best develop-
ment. If the children of Abraham, par excellence,
humanity's free men, failed to vote straight, who else
could? That vote, “Let Him be crucified,” twice re-
peated, was a true vote-national, racial, personal. It
was “ One-man-one-volo” in its purest form. Property
had no say in it. It was personality that spoke. The
will of man as man—the unrestricted suffrage of manhood
cast the die that sent the Saviour to the Cross.
There is much solid reasoning of the bull-
headed parsouical variety in this. The people
of Palestine, 18 centuries ago, voted that
Christ should be executed, therefore the people
shouldn’t have a vote. The parsons of that day
voted louder and harder than all the rest—in
fact, it was their villainous plot from the very
beginning ; therefore the parson of to-day
shouldn’t have a vote either, and Gray-Dixon
shouldn't have one. The old inhabitants of
Judea were- judged by their actions a
ruffianly crowd who, couldn’t be trusted with
the suffrage, and from this Dixon infers, that
the inhabitants of Australia to-day must be
ruffianly and not lit to be trust el either. The
preachers of Jerusalem were te.i times more
villainous and bloodthirsty than the people ;
eri/o, the preacher of to-day—Gray-Dixon in-
cluded —is a bloodthirsty villain also for exactly
the same reason as applies to the people. If
the conduct of the Hebrew artizau in the year
33 or thereabouts proves that the artizans of
to-day arc a had lot, then the demand of the
old Hebrew clergyman that the Lord should
be crucified, proves that the modern clergyman
— i. e., Gray-Dixon—wants to crucify Him also.
If he wants such a thing, then we presume he
ought to be in gaol. Why isn’t Gray-Dixon in
gaol, then? If that preacher will only look at
the thing according to his own logic, he ought
to be doing about 2500 years penal servitude.
Why on earth does Jack Murray, M.L.A. and
Republican, allow such a person as Gray-Dixon
to go unmuzzled in bis electorate?
Reflection from “ Los Carritos,” a new book
by Gertrude F. Atherton :
Has it ever occurred to you that the rich are at the
mercy of the poor, not the poor at that of the rich? Who
permits us to be rich if not the poor? Who, generation
after generation, have slowly and inevitably forged the
conditions which allow' a man to amass w'ealth at the
expense of Iris brethren, hut the poor—since they repre-
sent the great body of humanity ? Supposing each man
renting a house in San Francisco should suddenly arise
and say, “ I will pay no more rent.” Who would compel
him? The police? Militia? They are included in the
renting community. Who would compel them? The
army? Supposing the epidemic spread? What chance
would the army have against the concerted millions of
America? But that is just where we are safe. There
never will be a concerted movement. The timid and the
indifferent element are too largely in the majority, and all
must take the stand or none at all. But the fact remains
that we rich men hold our wealth because the poor man
fosters the conditions which enable us so to do.
This is a solemn reflection when it is carefully
considered. The whole race of rack-renting
landlords, monopolists, usurers, emperors, mili-
tary tyrants, priests, and other oppressors
could be destroyed in one act if the world would


It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. Wa

the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand thajb ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

human race should take no notice of them.
When two inonarchs declare war, if their armies
would simply look at them with a dull, fish-like
eye and do nothing, then these potentates
are both abolished there and then. If the whole
race of tenants would only stare with a clammy
expression at the rack-renting landlord when lie
wants the rent, and would look with a petrified
glare at the usurer when he tries to collect his (50

The huge, overbearing church which has grown
up slowly in the course of nineteen centurjes
could be wiped out in seven days or less if the
people would only sit up straight and refuse to see
anything when the plate comes round. Nearly
everything can be abolished, in fact, by passing
a unanimous resolution that it isn’t there, and
acting up to the resolution. There is no neces-
sity to clamour or howl against anything if the
world only knew it; all that is needed is to
wear a soulless, expressionless front and sit
down in a simultaneous way, and let it slide.

Holiness and dirt have a curious affinity.
Ihe local authorities of Clerkenvvell (London) are
threatening to take proceedings against f the Salva-

The obituary-poet has struck a bright, new

Up to now whisky has been the only stuff that

Augustus Moore tells of a delightful
criticism which a French lady once passed on M.
Renan’s “ Vie de Christ.” She read the book
through with continually increasing interest, until
she reached the passage where the Saviour is
represented as looking back, on his way to
Calvary, upon those few girls of Galilee, one of
whom might, under other circumstances, have
made his bliss. Then she closed the volume with a
sigh. “Helas!” she said, “ what a pity the story
does not finish with a wedding !”
There died at Port Arthur, the other day,
Host Cowen, of the Carnarvon Hotel—the former
residence of the “ Commandants,” of gory
memory. Cowen was a remarkable man in his
way, having been captain of a Confederate frigate
in the American Civil War, and a lieutenant of
volunteers in the last Maoriland trouble. In his
time he visited nearly every habitable part of the
globe. His last place of residence ere he settled
i n t Tasmania was Fiji, and he was contemplating
a “shift” to South America when he died from
the effects of a bullet-wound in the head received
years ago in one of the numerous engagements in
which he took part. These were also responsible
for the fearsome scars that covered his body. He
was an artist of no mean ability.
Thus Parson Nye, of Bendigo :
Young man, I ask if you, with an arm round the waist
of a girl, and indulging in a waltz, can truthfully say you
are representing your Master ?
Also —
Christ, when upon earth, engaged in the trade of a
carpenter. It was quite competent for Him to have
engaged in any other business, but can you picture to
yourselves a public-house with the sign over the door—
“ Jesus Christ, Licensed to Sell Spirituous Liquors ?”
Why does the parson ask—
You flesh-loving married man, can you imagine Christ
married and carrying around His latest bahy ? You know
you cannot. Then, if you marry and propagate offspring
can you truthfully say you are representing Him ? ’
But a truce to sermonising. What is a highly
creditable Christian onslaught in Parson Nye is
rank blasphemy in a writer who wears a striped
necktie.
One of the boy writers of Melbourne
Standard, which has become demoralized by
associating with a sporting paper, proposes that
the local garrotters shall be put upon “ a course of
diet just sufficient to keep body and soul together,”
and “treated to occasional doses of the lash,”m
public. It is a juvenile Tory doctrine that the
only way to wipe brutality out of the land is to
supply society with brutal exhibitions gratis. On
the strength of this idea free hangings flourished
like a green bay tree until quite recently, and
murderers were introduced as shocking examples
to the notice of audiences who were mostly crack-
ing nuts. Why any newspaper should seriously
advise a revival of the old order of things is im-
possible to understand. Under present conditions
a possible garrotter can shudder over his penn’orth
of blood-curdling details in the evening rag,
whereas a practical illustration of the horrors of
the lash would merely excite in a peaceable com-
munity an appetite for human suffering and
bananas.
This happened in Sydney, before the days
of the artillery reserves became numbered. One
of the crack batteries lacked its requisite strength
and to bring it up to its full complement authority
was given for recruiting. Some 20 odd men
presented themselves, were put through their pre-
liminary facings, and, seeming to promise well, a
“if . was set a Part for an examination as to
efficiency. When the evening arrived it was very
rainy, the examining officer had evidently lingered
long over the mess-dinner, and it was so dark
that the men’s features were undistinguish-
able. For some reason or other the recruits
failed to please the uniformed examiner, and
at the conclusion of an hour’s “test,” “His
Highness” swore roundly, told the candidates
they were a lob of fools and idiots, and
affirmed that even with the help of Heaven they
could not pass. He then left, but no sooner was
his back turned than a roar of laughter went up
from the men. It seemed that none of the recruits
had turned up, so, tb get the captain of the bat-
tery his efficiency-money, some of his best men
had combined to fool the examiner. That they
did not please him—men whose badges were of the
highest class—was put down to a disturbed liver.

BJ6 Macquarie-sfreet North, Sydney, Nov. 11,1891.
Wy Dear. Moorabinoa, —
Glancing foggily backwards at that already mildewed
excitement, the Melbourne Cup, which annually occurs a
day too late to allow The Bulletin to strike a fervent
attitude in several columns of rag-fair, padded out with
poitry ” about the wild woosh of horseflesh, and the pale
face of the eternal female whose Johnny is for ever at
Flemington staking his last lOU on a tricky bundle of
hoofs and hair—squinting solemnly backwards at the big
sartorial event, your Sappho seems as it she had passed ever
.so many hours in a coloured fashion-plate on that by-gone
Tuesday. Cup Day, like some of its devotees, was blue
and balmy, and as it has, I am told, been blue and balmy
for the last ten years, the thing must be getting mono-
tonous for the woman who looks best in a rain-proof
serge and an umbrella. The sunny weather hatched
summer frcckings, and the oblong lawn looked like a
chromotrope. Lady Hopetoun wore her favourite colour
(although it doesn’t become her best)—black, with Louis
scarf of turquoise blue crepe, tiny black topping-off with
blue forget-me-nots ; Lady Jersey encored that handsome
mixed-up gown of sap-green with moird pattern in black,
covered in black grenadine embroidered in a tiny pink
flower, bonnet en suite ; Lady Kintore wore ivory surah
trimmed with bands of lace insertion over prim-
rose, bonnet en suite ; Hopetoun’s lady cousins
wore bruise colours—that is, black and blue. The
other gowns were mostly soothers, but not at all cal-
culated to wring a sigh of hopeless envy from the bosom
of any woman who had a penny in the baby’s money-box
at home for the materials were mostly unassuming—
though it’s the cut that runs the total up. No colour
prevailed, though white and creamy tints had a big try
for first place, and white gamps bobbed up like toadstools
everywhere. Regarded as a shade-medium, a white
gamp is about as effective as a sheet of tissue-paper—but
they are “in” this summer and the swagger she must
chance sunstroke nowadays with her crownless gauze hat
and her unhned chiffon parasol. Long bodices, lace
basques, plain skirts, nothing new except a long, well-
fitting sleeveless jacket of fine black lace worn over a
turquoise-blue muslin, by a well-known Melbourne belle,
which was a charming resurrection (the jacket—not the
girl). Also, I thought I remarked a tendency on the part
of family groups to dress as foils to one another. Mamma
in heliotrope got Sissy up in delicate sea-green ; a girl in
iemon-colour was backed by her sister in pure white ; a
fawn frock gained life beside a mate in pale-blue—indeed,
charming contrasts chummed in so often that they got
to have quite a premeditated appearance.
A number of dresses were of flimsies over coloured
foundations—and one girl had blushingly chosen a
bilious tan for her slim-fit underslip, and the effect was
that of a sunburnt individual hurtling out of a bath in a
bed-curtain. I had a long, long look for the Cup belle,
but I sought vainly, for a great many of the girls were
pretty with a sort of suburban level of good looks, and
one pleased you almost as much as another; but it was
delightful to see that hardly one in twenty aided Nature
to any greater extent than powder-puff lengths. Of
course, there was the usual balance of shocking frooking;
the fattest female reckoned she was safe from criticism in
blue silk shot with crimson ; another wore a classically-
built black silk trimmed with gold with toga draperies
edged with Greek key pattern in gold ; a horrible old
woman with dyed hair and a patched-up “ as you will be”
visage, painted like a new house, trailed a bright-blue
train a yard long, and evidently regarded herself as one
of the ladies that make the lawn what it is, doncherknow;
and a red plush garment on a woman shaped like a cot-
tage loaf—one round atop of another—must have made
the sun wink its other eye.
The principal reason why I groaned audibly at Fleming,
ton on Oaks—yclept Ladies’—Day was the dozens o’
trussed-up doll-children torn round by stagey-minded
ma’s, who, I’ll bet, shake their offspring if they don’t call
them “dearest,” and train them like circus-dogs to coil
in graceful attitudes on hearth-rugs, and sich. The Aus-
tralian bantling doesn’t lend itself to the artistic. It
usually has a truculent expression and a bull voice, and it
won t act worth a split sixpence. It looks very very odd
to see Lord Fauntleroy rolling over in the dust and bel-
lowing because his gold-washed mother has run out of
jujubes, but while curls and sash-ribbon are cheap we
must just grin and bear it. There was a paucity of vice-
regal “ brow ” at the Oaks, only Lady Kintore lending a
subdued radiance to the Governor’s box with its faded
green chintz cushions and its eternal bunch of red roses.
The dresses were “ numerous and handsome,” but the one
that filled me with cold dread was a bright ghost-green
sparingly trimmed with black lace ; hat covered with
ghost-green feathers, and a ghost-green parasol which
gave the wearer’s face a phosphorescent ghastly light as
if from a corpse-candle. She looked as it the dead had
commenced to shriek and gibber in the streets of Mel-
bourne.
Steeple-chase day, on 7th instant, ended the V.R.C.
Cup meeting for 1891, and most people were content it
should be so. Four solid days of*crush and rags, of
horse and odds, are enough to satisfy the turfiest soul,
and there is a dreary monotony about the fourth break-
neck rush for a seat in the train ; the fourth hurried
lunch off uncooked farmyard patriarch—the fourth
jangle of “God Save the Queen” as the Governor rises
in the east. Women have a very genuine dread of jump-
ing-races, and yet they swarm into a racecourse if a
steeplechase is on the programme 1 and though they
loudly prognosticate, “Ooh! that one is sure to fall,” they
never turn their heads away even when the butterfly-
hued jockey is a rainbow heap on the green grass with his
horse falling atop of him. The vice-regal box had a
bevy of ladies. Lady Hopetoun resurrected her Cup
dress, with pink roses in her hat; Lady Kintore in etraw.
berry lined with a deeper colour and trimmed with bands
of strawberry velvet, ring bonnet of strawberry velvet
with cluster of lilies of the valley at the back ; Lady
Violet Willoughby wore her garden-party dress ; the rest
was also a twice-told tale. Melbourne’s friskiest spinster—
thoroughly reinstated in the social world because of the
big windfall lately dumped at her feet - looked innocence
itself in a simple gingham gown and a white straw hat;
the prettiest girl of last year’s Cup haunted the scene of
former victory in an artistic delaine and showed far more
than the clocks in her stockings when she hitched one
knee over the other in a ddgag6 way altogether
suggestive of cigar-boxes ; her papa’s red button-
holer suited him well in a Swinburnian sense -to my
thinking, Lothario should never wear a gardenia. Then
the touzled-headed woman, whose particular frisk with
a well-known doctor hasn’t been quite lived down,
dawdled along in aesthetic array. Somebody next points
out, dressed in gorgeous style, and simpering with half-
closed eyes at the grand-stand, “ the girl who ran off
with Mrs. Blank’s husband—of course, nobody knows her
now and following closely on her heels comes a fashion-
able and aggressive female, with false teeth and her eyes
lined round with black, who fires a red parasol at the
sun, and is described as “that poor Mrs. Dash, whose
husband ran away with the cash-box, you know, and left
her so miserable 1” Perhaps, after all, the grease-paint
and the fifty-guinea teeth are her way of wearing her
heart upon her sleeve.
The Cup this year is a very pawnable presentation-all
of solid silver. A partially-clothed young lady stands
erect on a sort of stump and holds out a wreath of oats
(typical of what the winner got up speed on) over a rather
ewe-necked steed and a mounted jockey, who gazes up-
wards with a rapt expression, but doesn’t attempt to
grab. It is a beautiful ornament, and looks as if it would
yield just the right number of ounces to the pound when
it reaches the inevitable melting-pot.
Melbourne vice-regal Cup ball wasn’t graced by Lady
Hopetoun, who left Lady J. and Lady K. to do the affable
business, but all the same it was a great success, the
diamonds of a snow-fair Sydneyite making the company
wink—as also did the clever frescoes of the women from
the Sydney side of the Murray, who were nearly all care-
fully-shaded-off-towards-the-jawbone beauties with an
emergency slab of Chinese vegetable rouge in their
pockets. On 6th instant the gubernatorial fete chant-
petre came off and a lovely day ensured all acceptances
and no scratchings, though the sun was too ardent for
some of the makes-up present, which got fearsomely
blotchy as the artist porspir&l. The dressing was mostly
da-capo —all of it had been seen at the» races. Lady
Hopetoun wore black and turquoise, blue bonnet en suite.
Lady Jersey—a favourite in Melbourne—in a mottled-grey
brocade like a frock made out of zinc, withdrew from
the gay and festive scene to catch the homeward express;
Lady Kintore encored herOupfrooking; Lady Willoughby
in shot terra-cotta with black grenadine, black hat with
pink roses. Comprehensive stacks of human fuel were
arranged in big marquees on the lawn, and a band backed
up the talk nicely, as usual—but the immovable police-
men set here and there about the grounds seemed to
imply that the company individually wasn’t the Hope-
touns’ dearest friend, and that it was sadly necessary for
somebody to keep an eagle eye on the cutlery.
Lady Hopetoun, it seems, goes out of her way to snub
the glittering society folk of “ Melbawne,” who, in their
aggressive turn, love to make unkind sotto voce remarks
when they think she is close enough to hear. The first
objection to the vice-regal mavourneen is, that she per-
sists in regarding the large white-vested Toorakian, who
made his little heap at vending rags wholesale, in the same
light as she does the little retail draper round the corner,
who does his own cheating—and treats them both in
exactly the same way. Now, in the bright lexicon of
Australian society the big softgoodsman who wags his
coat-tails into a building as big as a bank, with marble
steps and plate-glass doors, at ten a.m. daily, is a social
Somebody, whose wife and girls talk on the topmost note,
and whose vociferous disgust at “ trade” is almost whim-
sical under the circumstances, although most people
seem to swallow it and say, in a hushed voice, “how
dreadfully proud the Linsey-Woolseys are 1” Therefore,
the “first lady” in any Australian state must not strip
off the glamour which a carriage-and-pair and a dazzling
livery give to the man who really is only a trader, and
reveal the “ utter social impossibility ” of the tall-hatted
pomposity and his Paris-frooked family to a community
which has hitherto blindly reverenced him as the embodi-
ment of the inner circle. The vice-regal colleen calmly
does so—and marks the social value of her slighting
“how de do?” by sometimes even shaking hands with the
most ordinary shopman who ministers to her needs over
the counter. Which is the great reason why Lady
Hopetoun is spared the gushing affection of her temporary
subjects.
Melbourne sassiety is greatly exercised to know how
the married heroine of the aide-de-(s)camp will be received
by the local social world on her approaching return ? Let
me be a fair weather prophetess and predict open arms.
Why not? Doth not the divorcee cavort in the marble
halls of gubernatorial residence? and the frisky female,
doth she not kiss the staid vice-regal woman on both
cheeks ? It isn’t as if everybody didn’t know all about it.
There is a very promising Australian scandal about the
lady and her hopeless adorer who had a daring soul and a
fertile mind. It was at a ball held at a Town-hall, and
strolling down a corrider, “ Will you come in here ? ” into
So-and-So’s nicely-furnished office? Scarcely had the
door closed when a knock came, and he pretended that
“if we are discovered we are lost! ” rushed to the door and
locked it, but unfortunately the applicant was the man
who occupied the office, and, as it wasn’t opened to him
after repeated battering, he retired in disgust leaving a
menial to see who came out. When they did emerge the
news was all over the ball-room like wild-fire. Behind
the locked door Gussy had only proposed and been
rejected, but, of course, nobody wanted to think so, and
the lady further enhanced the situation by fainting away.
Whether she will marry him or not is the question which
agitates the scandal-mongers who shake their withered
heads over the lesson it is to girls to keep in the beaten-
track of verandah-lounges and conservatory chairs!
Lady Jersey certainly isn’t the first possibility in the
shape of a good dresser, but she alone, of all the vice-regal
women who adorned Melbourne Cup week, was the only
one who did not sartorially repeat herself. All the rest
did—horribly, but M. E. Jersey, who, as a litterateuse,
might be excused from this sort of thing, changed her
plumage every day. As a vice-regal clothes-peg, Lady J.
can now go top.
On dif that the only child of a vice-regal couple is going
to have its nose put out of joint. It is not expected the
newcomer will be christened Anything even approximately
Australian unless the happy papa gets it done secretly at
the dead of night on his own responsibility. I
Mr. Mark Foy is undoubtedly a man jvi|h jdfgq'. It was
from his fertile brain that fha scheme for saving the
boats of the “Sydney Flying Squadron Yacht Club,”
under different colours emanated. Thus, the Grace
Darling gaily sports a huge, pale-blue star on each sail,
whilst Bettina's colour is red,,and so on, so that onlookers
can eas ly distinguish each .boat, even at a, great dis-
tance. Hitherto, a sailing regatta has been as confusing
a sight as would be a horserace when : all the jockeys are
garbed alike—that is to outsiders to whose qnskilled
vision each boat is as like its fellow as one pea to another
pea bub, now, thanks to Mr. Foy, can all share in the
enjoyment of the race. Clark Island, last Saturday
afternoon, was alive with spectators ; amongst whom was
alarge contingent of smartly-gowned ladjes—the smartest,
perhaps, being quite a celebrity ill bet' own lin'e-W female
architect—a gown architect. This lady Was known ip
Melbourne as the Australian Worth, and was engaged by
Mr. Foy to come over to Sydney and superintend his
dress-department at a salary of many hundreds per
annum. * V

Says Dr. Mortimer Granville, the cham-
pion of alcohol: “Man is a brewing as well as a
cooking animal, and he will sink to barbarism in

Anyone who wants evidence of this should dine at

Ye unbelieving Thomases read this ! Mrs.
Therle, 62 Bathurst-street, hotel proprietress
writes Many thanks for the bottles of Mar-
shall’s Tonic Nervine sent as requested. I am

and find that my appetite has greatly improved
since taking it, as well as the tone of my health
generally.
The big Anglo-Australian Co.’s suspension
last week certainly “ did not come as a surprise”
for all the town of Sydney knew what the daily
papers were ignorant of (one of the Anglo directors,
curiously enough, is or was a very big shareholder
m the Sydney D.T., and another is the ex-editor
of the S. M. Herald) —viz., that weeks ago the
company stopped paying for several hours. The
dailies promptly showed up all the comparatively
small failures, but never a hint did they give of
the biggest one of all.
“Now, what are your witnesses prepared
to swear?” asked Mr. daggers, the criminal
lawyer itl “Great Expectations,” to one of his scaly
clients. *‘ Well,” replied the latter, “in a general
sort of way, almost anything.” This answer
seems to have peculiar application to some police-
men’s evidence, and after the reversal of Stipen-
diary Lee’s decision in the case of Petty-Officer
Caseley, of the Mildura, it will be decidedly in-
teresting to observe how the authorities will deal
with the constables who seemingly combined to
swear away a sober, respectable man’s liberty and
character.
As a sequel to the Queensland Parlia-
mentary vote of £2OOO for the widow and family
of thelate JackMacrossan, Mr. Buckland, M.L. A.
has successfully moved for a similar State gratuity
to the widow and family of thelate Henry Jordan,
a deceased statesman chiefly remarkable for his
undying faith in wholesale immigration, for his
devout Wesleyanism, for his interest in land
legislation, and his party fidelity to all Queen-
street Governments. He was so generally credited
with having no personal vice whatever that he
never was at all popular. In the early days of
Moreton Bay, the unemployed new-chums sent
out from the Queensland Immigration office in
London, used to parade Queen-street howling in
chorus—“ We’ve got no work to do-00-ooh !” They
were nicknamed “Jordan’s Lambs.”
Thus Schey, M.P., secretary to the inter-
provincial railway convention ;
The service in N.S.W. is in a most deplorable condition
—honeycombed, infested, with pimps, sneaks and spies.
This abominable system of espionage has resulted in most
disgusting exhibitions of faithlessness, and it is disgrace-
ful that the country allows the expenditure of a large sum
of money annually in perpetuating the dastardly practice.
In Queensland, affairs are much worse. The Commis-
sioners have used every endeavour to break up the local
associations. Officers of the department have even
resorted to the illegal device of opening the employes’
letters, with the object of ascertaining whether the latter
were in sympathy with the recent strike.
It was further stated by the Queensland delegate
that the Queensland Coniinissi oners’ repressive
measures, combined with the espionage system,
had reduced the local association’s membership
from 700 to 350.
The head of the house of Fairfax, known
in the S.M. Herald as “ Mister James,” is back,
and has been given by his devoted employes,
duly assembled in the Sydney Y.M.C.A. Hall,
the usual return welcome, consisting chiefly of
psalms, prayer, and lemonade. He was musically
denominated “a Jolly Good Fellow,” which is
somewhat surprising, for though the Fairfaxes
(and their papers) are all “good,” not to say
goody-goody, none of them have been known to
be singularly jolly up to date. Mr. Sam. Cook,
business manager, “took occasion,” as usual, to
refer to the Herald, Mail and Echo as “great
papers,’’—which they certainly are in the sense of
containing a thundering lot of paper and
remarked that the Herald’s new double-web
machines “produced newspapers at the rate of
24,000 an hour.” For how many hours a day,
Samuel ?

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Criterion “School.”
Theatre Royal “Robbery Under Arms.”
Garrick “Run Wild.”
“Run Wild,” at Sydney Garrick, is the
sad tale of a long female’s repentance, and the
regeneration of an oily cad. The female is
Parker’s wife ; she moves in high society, and has
an eye like the front lamp of a locomotive, and a
fierce underjaw that sticks out after the manner of
a bull-dog’s head ; and the oily one is Parker’s
son. Parker himself is a self-made man, and he
looks dreadfully like the sort of man that a man
that looks like him would be likely to make. He
is honourable, cheerful, and stumpy, and his
clothes are a bad misfit. His wife repudiates him,
principally by reason of his stumpiness and his
misfit; and his son disguises their relationship by
passing his parent off as a distant acquaintance
named Jones. His brother-in-law, a haughty
baronet with an all-seeing eye, casts him off as he
would cast off a worm, and nobody cares for the
lonesome Parker except his daughter and her dog.
He is a sad, broken-spirited millionaire, till his
cotton-mill burns down with no insurance on it,
and then there is a change. His wife returns
with a tear shining in her fierce eye, and flings
herself up against him and tells him that she will
never leave him any more. Then the son looms in
the doorway weeping silently into his hat; he also
has come back to repent, and he also leans up
against Parker, and in a contrite spirit tells him
that he will see him through. The daughter and
the dog also undertake to see Parker through.
The elongated and noble youth who is engaged to
the daughter guarantees to stick to him, and the
silent man who is going to marry Parker’s niece
intimates, by a glare and a nod, that he will prop
up Parker to the last gasp. Even the son’s rowdy
acquaintances seem inclined to rally round Parker
at this crisis, and, last of all, the baronet enters
with a great resolution on his face, determined to
stand or fall by Parker. Then it transpires that
Parker is all right ; he had sold the mill two weeks
previously, and, consequently, he isn’t ruined
after all. Presumably the man he sold it to is
mined instead, but that man isn’t in the bill, so
nobody seems to care about him. The story ends
amid general rejoicing, and only The Bulletin
man sheds a single tear over the fate of that lost,
unnoticed, nameless, friendless individual who
bought Parker’s mill and was burnt out.
# * *
“ Run Wild ” is a good play all the same.
Jennie Lee, as Parker’s daughter, is a girl who is
calculated to gladden any man’s heart, and with
such a maiden to cheer his declining years the
old man’s lamentations over the lost wife with the
combustible eye are badly misplaced. Frank
Cates is another gaudy success as Jennie’s future
husband, an individual who is too long to be an
inhabitant of this short earth, and too excited to
be an angel. A certain H. Diver is an absolute
genius as an easy-going person with his jewellery
in pawn ; E. P. Carey does old Parker with much
success, and Richard Stewart does young Parker
with comparatively little. When he comes back
repentant and wailing into his hat he is, in fact,
within an ace of utter failure. The other bright
features of the show are Mr. Shine, Miss Con-
stance Deorwyn, and the dog. This animal badly
wants to eat Shine in the second act, and unless
that gentleman learns to howl less and run a good
deal more, some portion of his anatomy will be
butchered one of these nights to make a dog’s
holiday at the Garrick.
** * *
That stupendous work of art, Sells’ Circus,
opens at Moore Park, Sydney, on Thursday next
(November 19). According to public rumour, it
is a huge show, containing all the animals ever
seen or heard of, and a lot more that have been
lying low, at great expense, ever since the Crea-
tion, in order to make their first appearance on
this auspicious occasion. Also, it contains a lot
more animals that have been newly made by
special arrangement with Providence. This latter
is a deserving institution, and Sells’ Circus has
always made it a point to back up Providence,
and lend it every encouragement. It was origin-
ally proposed to open this week, but a gentleman,
whose card describes him as “ Charles Stow,
Editor,” informs us of the change of plan. We
haven’t seen Mr. Stow, and we don’t actually
know what a gentleman who edits a circus is like.
But we once knew a man who was sub-editor to a
learned pig, and another who was dramatic critic
to a hippopotamus, and they were both exceed-
ingly agreeable individuals. Also, we have been
introduced to a person who acted as poet to a
performing serpent, and he was about the nicest
man we ever knew.
** * *
“ School” is doing good business at Syd-
ney Criterion. There are whole stacks of girls in
this comedy—slender, poetic girls with dreamy
faces ; plump, jovial girls whose hair won’t keep
straight; sad, soulful girls who look as if they
had a tendency to be religious and die young;
girls with dark hair and affectionate dark eyes ;
other girls with golden hair and blue eyes; more
girls with all kinds of hair and brown eyes; oceans
of girls with all sorts and descriptions of eyes;
and a story with so many girls in it can’t by any
possibility be a failure. But unluckily there are
only two beauteous lovers lurking in the garden,
and they are a very small allowance compared to
such a tremendous lot of girls. It is very dark, and
damp, and wormy in that garden, and there amid
the dew and the caterpillars, and the slimy insects
that crawl on their stomachs by reason of not
having any legs, the lovers lie waiting on the off-
chance of seeing some curly brown head at the
window or hearing a soft titter through a key-
hole. And here the story isn’t true to life, and
the author doesn’t know what he is talking about.
The present writer also lurked outside a girl’s
school once in the hope of seeing a little, glossy,
golden wig at the casement, and he can tell by
experience exactly what the consequences of such
a proceeding are. The window opened on
that occasion; in the faint, romantic moon-
light there appeared the shimmer of a
snow-white robe, and a white neck, and
a rounded arm that was too beautiful
for this dull, material earth. Then a musical
voice said something in an undertone, and the
writer hastily shook the spiders and the green
bugs out of his flute, and prepared to strike up a
serenade. Next moment he was almost blinded
by a half-eaten pie, which fetched him in the left
eye, and he was also shot by a ginger-beer bottle.
Tiie angels were having a surreptitious feed in the
bedroom—a feed of coarse and common pork-pie,
and they had nearly blown his brains out with
the fragments. There is mighty little romance in
a girls’ academy after all, and a crippled person,
who went home that night with a broken flute
and the remains of a bottle embedded in his
system, hereby lifts up his voice and says that
Robertson is a delusion.
* * *
“ School ” is an interesting comedy, how-
ever, because the midnight feed element is kept
in the background, and no one explains that the
girl with the dreamy eyes is only dreaming of
tarts and unwholesome buns. Messrs. Titheradge,
Gordon, Lyndal, and Boucicault keep up the
heavy end of the show. The latter individual
makes a glittering success as that ancient ruin,
Parintosh, he of the wig, and the old shop teeth,
and the venerable corns, and the immoral glass
eye, and the unutterable togs. Mr. Lawrence
does Krux, the pallid sneak whose ear, like that
of the Sydney Social Purity Society, has been
enlarged with much listening at keyholes, and
whose moist and filmy optic, also like that
of Sydney Purity Society, is worn out through
being fixed for many years at the cracks of doors,
and exposed to the draught from the other side.
Also, Misses Spong, Romer, and Pattie Browne,
make up the balance of the show, and as there is
no tail to the Criterion company they are all that
any reasonable white man could desire.
** * *
“The Dancing Girl” has been dancing
this week on her last legs at Her Majesty’s (Syd-
ney), No one seems to regret her much, and her
MADAME MELBA.
funeral promises to be unobtrusive. The min-
strelsy business is prospering at the School of
Arts, and the Cycloraraa continues to grind up
the old Battle of Gettysburg on the old grindstone
of history with remorseless regularity. It makes
us feel sorry when we think of that painted
encounter and the man who won it. It was about
the biggest battle of the long war. and it broke
the back of the Southern Confederacy; and
yet Meade is almost forgotten because he
didn’t know how to advertise himself when the
war was over. If the famous Smythe had got
hold of him immediately after Gettysburg, and
fixed him for a course of lectures, he would have
made a pile.
** * *
“Robbery Under Arms” is doing good
business at Sydney Royal to the last. Even if
the play were eighteen times worse than it is,
Dampier and the scenery would pull it through.
In fact, Dampier, when at his best, could pull
anything through, and if we had a ponderous
bullock-dray stuck in a quicksand we would put
our faith in Alfred’s haulage capacity sooner than
in a team of 16 horses. Next Saturday the
“ Corsair ” goes up with a strong company. He
is a melodious bass bandit in B flat or thereabouts,
and judging by our personal experience of bandits
we presume that he opens a bank in his ensan-
guined lair, and drags his shrieking captives there
in chains with their long, golden hair hanging
down their backs, and then, while they pray for
death as a merciful release, he brutally compels
them to put their money on fixeddeposit for three
years at 10 per cent.
** * *
Bondi Aquarium has a bill a yard long,
and what with Hungarian bell-ringers, champion
lady skaters, Egyptian jugglers, a “ suspended
lady ” —which doesn’t mean a hanged lady—min-
strel shows, concerts, brass bands, zither players,
a suicidal individual who walks on a wire, a huge
concert, a farce, caves, seals, fish, and a lot of
other things, it makes a huge shillingsworth.
Manager Wyburd boasts that 16,000 people
haunted his show on the bald-headed Heir-
Apparent’s birthday. From this we gather that
Tummy’s birthday is a lot more useful to Wyburd
than it is to Tummy himself.
* * #
“The Jonquille ” three-nights season at
the Adelaide Royal was a dismal failure. As
already stated, the revival was to be for the benefit
of the young author, Guy Boothby, who was in
hopes of a tidy cheque to cover portion of his
expenses to England, but, alas, it was not to be,
and with Boothby all is lost save honour and the
MS. of “The Jonquille,” which may yet turn up
a trump card. At present, however, the drama-
tist has given up all hope of going to England, and
rumour has it that he intends retiring in a satur-
nine frame of mind to a northern station, where
he will commune gloomily with Nature. Some of
his critics think this will be rough on Nature, but
The Bulletin feels sure that institution will pull
through. Possibly, in the solemn bush, Mr.
Boothby may begin to write dramas of the George
Darrell type, but we trust not. The theatre has
been closed for a week. Next issue we shall refer
to the production of “Human Nature,” by the
Gerald-Duff company, and either explain to our
own satisfaction why it failed, Or prove conclu-
sively that we foresaw its success from the
beginning, and that we gave Gerald his first start
in life, and frequently patted him on the head
when he was a boy.
** * *
Cup week has given big houses to Mel-
bourne shows—mostly to the Princess and Alex-
andra. That venerable idiot, “ The Old Guard,”
is well supported by the public and a quantity of
assorted female legs, likewise Wm. Elton a,nd
Eraisette. This astounding hunk of entertaining
nothingness seems to draw quite as well as the
braininess of Gilbert and Sullivan, a fact generally
attributable to the shapely extremities of the
ballet. There is no sign of a change at the big
house just yet.
«« * «
“ A Night Off ” at Melbourne Bijou
becomes less pleasing on continued acquaintance.
It does not approach within shooting distance of
the previous production at the Princess. Anson
is the only one of the original Australian cast,
and even he introduces a buffoonery that is rather
painful. There is, of course, the prejudicial
influence of an earlier experience of the play, but
even allowing for that, the present cast is not
equal to the old one. Considering all things,
however, the show is feeling very well, thank you,
although Miss Bronton is not too satisfactory as
the wife of the professorial crank man.
** * *
At the Opera House, that alleged comic
opera, “The Corsair,” finished Tuesday last, and
as a consequence Melbourne has decided to hold
a special week of thanksgiving. Brigand Stanley
started to tell the people how he found a man
named Livingstone on Wednesday night, and
continues thereon until Saturday. There is
nothing fixed for next Monday, and on that date
“Corsair” or the blood-curdling “Evangeline”
may be revived. And it will take a lot to revive
either anyway.
** * *
The Siege of Paris Cyclorama, in Bourke-
street, has done better than any other show since
last time of writing. Manager Forster is still
lecturing on that incident of European hate and
idiocy. The halls do well as usual, and the
Gaiety niggers open their heads quite as much as
they used to do.
** * *
“Faust” has drawn immense houses to
the barnlike Alexandra, on Cuttica nights espe-
cially. The lady is a magnificent Margherita,
but her hubby makes a very poor Faust. Melossi,
as Valentine, puts in some fine work, and his
singing in the duel and death scenes provides
holier amusement than a dog-fight in which both
dogs are chawed into fragments. The Mephisto.
of Traviaglini is a good-voiced devil who can’t act,
and Signorina Mattioli’s Siebel is a refreshing
little fellow in cream tights. “Sonnambula,”
with Cuttica as Amina, held the fort on Monday
and Tuesday, and “Trovatore” was put on
Wednesday. To-night (Thursday) “Lucia” will
be revived, and to-morrow the tenor, Yilalta,
benefits with the successful “Faust.” Madame
finishes the Melbourne season with a big concert
at the Town Hall on Saturday, and the Alexandra
will probably be occupied after that by the ever-
green Dam pier.
** * *
“ Lights o’ London ” died a sudden death
on Wednesday, and George Rignold puffed and
floundered in the tank, and showed people he
was becoming elderly for the last time. The
next show at this house will be “ Rob Roy,” with
Walter Bentley in the name part. Bentley, up to
date, at any rate, does not look like success, for
the crowd supporting him is, for the purposes of
Scotch drama, very haggard. Eloise Juno will be
the Helen Macgregor, and the Bailie has been
given to Cathcart, who, though a sterling actor,
was not designed by Heaven for a dialect part.
Juno was the best Helen in Australia at one
time, and so a saving clause is inserted in her
favour.
At Poverty Point.
Lucia Harwood temporarily filled Fanny Brough’s
place in “A Sailor’s Knot,” at Drury Lane, and with con-
siderable success. It is wonderful what a little Australian
experience generally does for actors and actresses. Per-
haps it is that they hear “ home truths” more frequently
in Australia than they do in England.
Apropos to the recent scenes in the Opera House, Paris,
on the occasion of the production of “ Lohengrin,” it is
recorded that when “ Othello” was performed by a Lon-
don dramatic company at the Theatre de la Porte St.
Martin, in 1822, some interested people spread the report
that Shakespeare was one of Wellington's aides-de-camp
at Waterloo. This was enough for the shop-boys of the
Faubourg Saint Denis—they stormed the theatre.
Haddon Chambers is in request; for, in addition to the
play he is writing for Thorne, he has been commissioned
by Mrs. John Wood to construct one for her. It is very
doubtful, however, whether Haddon’s style will suit a
Court audience. The Court is essentially a comedy
house, and Haddon’s humour is of the obscure order. It
took weeks to work up the comedy business in “ The
Idler,” and even at its best it is the weakest part of the
play.
Harold Frederic has had to resign membership of the
Savage in consequence of an allegation that he had made
certain rash assertions about the wife of a fellow member.
He is a loss to the club, but his offence appears to have
been too gross to be overlooked. There are rumours i,n
the air of libel-actions and all kinds of things in connec-
' tion with this affair. “Doyvid” Anderson, the inventor
and proprietor of the school of journalists is one of those
who are to be shot at.
George Coppin has an opportunity of immortalising
himself. Let him import, if he can secure them, Daly’s
company. I promise you, writes our correspondent, that
you have never had such a treat in Australia, and I do not
doubt that the speculation would be a great success. Ada
Rehan alone is worth going ten thousand miles to see. A
more consummate artist never walked the boards. Her
latest London hit has been in “ The Last Word.” Never
surely was such uproarious applause heard in any theatre
as saluted her performance in the second act, when the
house fairly went wild. Ellen Terry never had such an
ovation at the Lyceum, and that is saying a good deal.
It was thought when he left for Australia that Laurence
Cautley’s eyes would fetch ’em. The Savage Club
wonders if the “ widdy ” is gilded.
George Musgrove is living at Weybridge. Nellie Stewart
is not to be the Blue-Eyed Susan in the new comic sing-
song at the Shaftesbury. The part has been offered to
the giddy Florence St. John, who will probably accept it.
M. Marius is to stage-manage. What are the odds
against a reconciliation and another marriage ?
“ My Sweetheart ” is drawing good paying houses at
London Vaudeville, and yours merrily, Jno. R. Rogers,
and Minnie are like a pair of turtle doves. The quarrel

L. S. Mapleson has written an account of Adelina Patti’s
last tour in Mexico. The Diva received no less than
£34,000 for 30 performances. Tamagno, the tenor, was
paid £4OO a night. The result of the Mexican visit was
that the National Mont de Pibt6 was besieged for weeks
by members of impecunious but proud families, who pre-
ferred to pledge all belonging to them rather than it
should appear that they were unable to afford the
exorbitant prices charged for seats.

On the last night of a burlesque, which recently had a

J. C. Williamson paid Nellie Farren a graceful parting
compliment. Wybert Reeve, inspired by Jimmy, sent
Treasurer Whittington and assistants down to the Poly-
nesien at Port Adelaide to lavishly decorate Nellie’s state
cabin with flowers and make the place look like a small
Paradise. The Farren was ashore doing the Block, and
consequently knew nothing about it.
Meston’s programme for the forthcoming tour of
Europe and America with a troupe of Queensland niggers
includes eleven different kinds of corroboree. Meston,

POLITICAL POINTS
Let the Single-taxers leave generalities
alone and give ns calculations based on the official
statisticians’ figures.
By virtue of the system of plural voting
six members of the present N.S.W. Ministry have
votes in East Sydney.
In three years Parkes has bestowed upon
political supporters the largo sum of <£25,600 in
commissioners’ fees !
In his early career as a legislator, Parkes
made several attempts to abolish the death-
penalty, but could never secure a majority.
“ The trouble is this : not that I am setting
Protection above Federation, but that I will not
set Freetrade above Federation.” — Barton.
East Sydney, the citadel of Freetrade, has
returned some distinguished Protectionists to the
Assembly. Parkes, Martin, Buchanan, Barton.
Solomon’s motion in S.A. Assembly for
the abolition of capital punishment was rejected
by 23 to 12. This vote represents a satisfactory
ad vance.
W. E. Abbott and J. F. Burns might have
been shoved into the Nominee Council (N.S.W.)
if Parkes had remained in office a few months
longer.
A. G. Taylor would not, on principle,
oppose Toby Barton for East Sydney. His views
were not the same in 1884, when he helped Bur-
dekin to defeat G. H. Reid.
The Imperial Institute authorities are very
much disgusted with Sir Henry Parkes for not
redeeming Sir Patrick Jennings’ promise of a
liberal contribution from N.S.W.
The Dibbs Ministry have agreed to talk
but ten minutes on a question. Slattery and
Copeland might as well be gagged. It takes these
politicians an hour to work off an idea.
Mr. Eli Moremon (Memo, for printer: This
name to be spelt very carefully. —En. B.) proposed
candidate Grantham at East Sydney hustings.
Moremon ! Belongs to the Parkes party, you bet.
Black Wednesday is ahead in New South
Wales. The absolute success of the Democratic
party will be signalised by the application of the
axe to the root of the monstrously overgrown Civil
f-g.r vice.
C. C. Kingston, Q.C. (S.A.): —“I look
forward to the time—and I hope it is not far
distant—when no true unionist will work with a
blackleg, just the same as no master would employ
a person of that class.”
Parkes approved of £11,500 being spent
upon a statue of Governor Phillip, and yet ho
grudgingly placed £2oooon the N.S.W. Estimates
(on condition of £2OOO being subscribed) towards
a statue of John Dunmore Lang !
Is it essential that a Cabinet Minister
should submit the Commonwealth Bill to the
N.S.W. Assembly? It is not a Government
measure, but a mere draft of a constitution. Why
not allow’ Parkes to run his fad to the death ?
The Tasmanian Ministry got so savage
under the criticisms of the press that they came
down with a Defamation Bill which punished a
person with two years’ imprisonment who de-
famed a member of Parliament ! It was rejected
by the Council.
Premier Dibbs: “There are only two
things that can be produced in N.S.W. as cheaply
as they can bo imported. These are, mutton and
beef, and, without protection, the whole country
wmuld soon be devoted to the production of these
two things.”
D. Melville, M.L.C., Vic. (on plural
votes): “ Yet it is pretended that these thieves —
these land-jobbers who rob no one man but every
man—are more valuable and more reliable than
industrious workmen who bring up their families
respectably and die poor.”
The Sydney D.T., after printing 20 leaders
or more against the election of Toby Barton for
East Sydney, jumped Jim Crow on election day
and called upon the Freetraders to vote for the
Protectionist Minister. The paper has now boomed
in turn almost every politician in the province.
It must not be forgotten that, notwith-
standing the fact that all their theoretical curses
are properly directed against the man who buys
State land cheap and makes profit out of the un-
earned increment, the N.S.W. Single-tax League
proposed to exempt the free-selectors from the tax.
Parkes has not yet closed his political
diary. He intends to see the Dibbs Ministry take
their seats on the Treasury benches. Will he dare
to plunge the Assembly into confusion on the
fiscal question ? Or is he merely going to the
House to watch the course of John Haynes and
George Reid ?
The exact population of Bananaland is
393,718 persons—223,779 males and 169,939 females.
During the last five years the males have increased
17.56 per cent, and the females 28.25 per cent ;
during the decade —males, 78.56 per cent, females'
92.67 per cent. Woman is still wanted by the
fervent Banana man.
Member Hancock thinks South Australia
could get cheaper money in other countries than
Great Britain. The nagging of the London sharks
and papers may yet force an appeal to the money-
dealers of Paris, Berlin, and New York. And
why not ? The money-market is slowly, but
surely, shifting from London.
The N.S.W. Freetraders are now as hard-
up for a leader as ever the Protectionists were. If
Parkes retires will G. H. Reid, the deadly
opponent of Federation at any price, upon whom,
in that respect, has fallen the mantle of old Jack
Robertson, lead the party of Frectrade and Federa-
tion ? He is the Freetraders’ most popular man.
The Dobsons have been leading figures in
Tasmanian politics for many years. Chief Justice
Dobson is the head of the family: he was
Attorney-General in several administrations.
Henry Dobson, a wealthy attorney, has the
reversion of the Premiership in his hands. Alfred
Dobson has been successively Attorney-General,
Speaker, and Solicitor-General.
This is the very latest in the way of loyal
Tory corruption. Under the Macdonald reyime
in Canada nearly every official of any standing
had a mistress, who was registered as a civil
servant at a good screw. The nation paid for
everything ; if a public functionary even stood
oysters and stout to a ballet-girl, he charged it to
A NEW FREETRADE INDUSTRY.
“Wanted, ten heavy men, not less than 13st., for Saturday sailing crew. All crew’s
expenses paid. First race next Saturday. Apply at once. E. C. Leader, Oxford-street,
op. Sacred Heart.”— SYDNEY D.T.
his suffering country, and if he bolted with his
neighbour’s wife he sent in a bill for doing it, and
the bill was paid right off.
The Bulletin no more understands why
the N.S. Wales Labour-party should make a
special dead-set against Barton at East Syd-
ney than it understands why it opposed Traill
for South Sydney,- or why Dibbs excluded
from his Government both Traill and O'Sullivan
in favour of a nonenity like Postmaster-General
Kidd, who is apparently a mere sop to Orangeisin,
just as Parkes’ Postmaster-General was a top to
the opposite party.
Crick, M.P. (N.S. W,), after his experience
with the late Premier, has forsworn all complicity
with political appointments, especially those of
an Exhibition nature. “Look hero!” he ex-
claimed, the moment that a request was broaohed
to him the other day in King-street, “I wouldn’t
try to get a Civil Service appointment in Aus-
tralia, Banjcewangie, or in Boorioboola-crha, not
even for my own brother, and, thank God, I
haven’t got one.”
The (Foreign) Agreements Validating Act
(N.S.W.), which enables the enforcement of
labour-contracts made abroad, after 10 years’
operation is sought to bo repealed by the Demo-
crats. It had a stormy passage through the
Assembly. The third reading was carried by the
Speaker’s vote. Sir John Robertson moved that
the bill do now pass ; but the votes being again
equal, the Speaker voted with Ihe uoes ; and it
was only after some delay and a long debate that
the measure got through.
Premier Dibbs has informed a Wagga
audience that “the appointment of members to the
Legislative Council is one of the prerogatives that
can be exercised by the Governor, if ho chooses,
without the advice of his Ministers.” That may
be technically constitutional law, but the first
Australian Governor who tried the experiment of
swamping the Council with his personal nominees
would soon find himself without Ministerial
Advisers —and out of a billet.
A Bill has been introduced into N.S.W.
Legislature to legitimatise, on the marriage of the
parents, children born out of wedlock. This has
long been the law in Scotland, and it is difficult
to understand how any country professing to be
liberal in politics and Christian in religion could
be otherwise. It is barbarous and illogical to
continue to punish innocent children for the
laches of their parents, and the only fault with the
measure under notice is that it does not go far
enough.
The three-legged provisional proposals * f
Premier Griffith having been defeated on practical
formulation by 33 to 28 votes, the Queensland
Northern and Central members will agitate for
territorial separation and nothing else. The
Coalition Government is tired of the present bal-
ance-step-withont-gaining-ground Parliament and
will probably dissolve. Griffith and Co. are
quietly consolidating the voting chances, and
MTlwraith is prepared (on compulsion) to retire
gracefully.
Under Victorian Minister Outtrim’s new
Mines Bill, a most drastically radical measure,
the present facilities afforded to miners for gold
and silver-mining upon private property and upon
Crown-leased or Crown-licensed lands will bo
extended to mining for coal, tin, antimony, and
other minerals. In fact, the Bill seeks to estab-
hsh the Crown right to all minerals in or upon the
land, to give the Crown power to resume or enter
upon any mineral land, or to grant permission to
private persons to do so.
r In formally opening the new Melbourne
Trades-hall last week, Chairman Winter wept
over the unavoidable absence of Gov. Hopetoun,
thus .indicating fin underlying tendency to idol-
worship which should have no place in Labour's
home-paddock concerns. If a trades body can’t
shoot out a new, live claw without yearning for
the presence and patronage of a foreign nominee,
wlk se very place in an alleged democracy is the
symbol of the restriction of that democracy’s free-
dom, it is not worthy of its mission.
Speaking at East Sydney, Attorney-General
Barton said that Pulsford’s excuse when he re-
signed theN.S. W. Freetradesecretaryship was that
“tlu; creature Protection ” was dead. “Whereas,”
said Barton, “it seemed that it was only the
N.S.W. Frectrade exchequer which was deceased,
and if Protection was really dead, how came it
that they now found a live Protectionist Ministry
in office?” “Pooh!” said a voice in the crowd,
“that is only a resurrection!” “Resurrection,*’
replied Barton, “is the beginning of immortality.’
W. S. Target!, once member for Hartley
(N.S.W.), and James Coombe, were asked by the
Tasmanian Assembly to explain their conduct at a
public meeting. The answers were curt and
cutting; and the House at once instructed the
Attorney-General to amend the law so as to reach
such vulgar critics in the future. Targett de-
nounced the conduct of the Ministry as “a
disgrace to a civilised community,” while Coombe
wrote to the House —“One would think from the
eagerness of the present Government to pass syn-
dicate bills they were affected by the almighty
dollar in the way of tips.” The'VJ.ended House
was surprised to discover that it could not punish
for contempt committed outside its walls.
“ It is true we (be., S.A.) have a Lcgisla
tive Chamber representing property, and we have
a Governor appointed by the Queen. The first is
an anachronism that must soon be corrected. The
second, a relic introduced for spectacular purposes,
which will continue until we begin to think. The
second chamber, as at present elected and consti-
tuted, is under sen'cnco of death without hope of
reprieve. It may come to a sudden end, or it may
linger out a little longer, but it is so absolutely
contrary to the spirit of the age that it would not
surprise us if it were lynched The
Governor, like the Queen, reigns, but does not
govern, but his very existence has a bad moral
effect. In a community such as ours no position
ought to be other than elective. And while the
head of the Executive is nominated and appointed
by the British Government, wo have not attained
political freedom.” —The late liev. Huyk Gilmore
( Adelaide).
Signs are not wanting that the British
Primrose League lias passed its zenith and is on
the decline. It is not a very wholesome symptom
that the Grand Council should commence to
lecture the various habitations for their parsimony
in neglecting to subscribe to the funds of the
head office. No less than GOO habitations omit to
subscribe at all, and about 150 more send less
than =£l each. The fact is that many of the silly
old nobodies who love to sport an enatmlhd
primrose in their button-holes as if it were an
order of merit are dying off, and the younger
members of the League are beginning to see that
the funds are being expended in big salaries for
swells who can find nothing else to do but taek
themselves on to the staff for the sake of a living.
The League has clearly had its day, and a Liberal
majority at the next general election would give
it its finishing touch. Please don’t let Lady
Jersey know this—adds The Bulletin corres-
pondent.
Kingston, Q.C., last week moved the
second reading of his Conciliation Bill in S,A.
Parliament. The measure proposes that a Board
of Conciliation shall be appointed by the
Governor, to consist of three masters’ and throe
mens’ representatives, and a president to be
appointed by Parliament. The president to hold
office during good behaviour and to receive a
substantial salary. In any case of dispute, the
Minister of Industry first to investigate the nature
and extent thereof, and decide whether or not it
shall be referred to a State board. If yes, the
Governor next, by proclamation, to so refer the
question. The award of the Board to be binding,
and enforceable by a registrar. The Board to
have power to appoint preliminary committees of
settlement; also, the option of refraining from
making any award, and of publishing anopinioha-
tive report on the dispute instead. Local boards
to be elected, except in the case of the chairman,
who must be a man altogether unconnected with
industry, and appointed at the first meeting by
both employers and employees. Private boards
of conciliation, arranged by agreement, are also
recognised by the Bill. A Conciliation Hall to be
erected at the expense of (he country.
It is tolerably evident, writes The Bulle-
tin London correspondent, that Mr. Schnadhorst,
the British Liberal organiser, is only half-heart* d
in regard to direct labour representation The
report of the Liberal Federation, for which he is
responsible, throws cold water upon the scheme
by attempting to prove how very different circum-
stances are in England and Australia. Nobody
said they were not; but the Liberal wire-pullers
seek any excuse to back out of supporting direct
labour representation. Payment of Members,
they say, will be one of the planks in the new
Liberal platform, but they are careful to point out
that even when that point is achieved wc shall be
very little nearer to labour representation. It is
very clear that the party are glad enough to make
use of the working-man’s vote at the polls, but
they fear that as Members of Parliament the
workman may be apt to put labour questions
before party allegiance. So long as a constituency
can be fought by a rich man they are ready to
ignore a labour candidate; it is only where the
bloated capitalist has no chance of defeating the
Tories that a pro’etaire will be looked upon with any
favour. The Liberal Federation has gone even so
far as to chide the labour-party for presuming to
nominate at all when a Liberal is in the field.
“Save me from my Liberal friends,” should be
the working-man’s prayer. He has as little to
hope for from one party as the other. Patience,
good organisation and aggressiveness are his only
hope.

finish with Brisbane’s athletic solicitor. Arm-
strong won the first mill, but in the return match
his opponent went for A.’s body and let his own
face take care of itself. The result was that the
diva’s husband was so badly knocked out by a
body-blow that he went to bed for a fortnight,
while his slim conqueror took his painted face to
and from his office in a cab.
Matt. O’Shannassy is in London under the
chaperonage of J. R. Medley, who was formerly
an officer of N.S.W. police. “ Old Med.” is itdus
achates to most of the Australians who visit
England for a run, for he has the town at his
fingers’ ends, and knows a little about everything.
He saw Martin Loughlin safely through the
snares of Modern Babylon, and saved him from
the wiles of the Regent-street sirens.
Donald Gordon, the original owner of the
Mount Morgan Goklmining Co.’s freehold, is now
living on a miserable selection below the Main
Range, on the flat country towards Ulam, and is
“literally without the means to supply himself
with the bare necessaries of life.” Gordon, in his
time, owned Kyanga Station, near Banana;
Ellangowan and Jondaryan Stations, on the
Darling Downs ; a grazing farm on what is now
Mount Morgan township; and the freehold
already referred to. A diabolical run of bad luck
seems to have haunted his whole life.

A row is in progress in British Columbia
owing to the Chinamen there having got into a
depressing habit of killing their sick relatives.
They do this partly to. save worry and expense,
and partly for fear the disease should developo
into leprosy, and arouse an anti-Chow scare in
the land. How long the custom has prevailed no
one knows, but it only leaked out the other day.
An incipient leper kicked against the butchery,

“Braeside” Allan gravely told the Banana-
land Assembly the other day that, on theN.S.
W. side of the rabbit-fence, the rabbits were
lying dead piled-up in such numbers that the
squatters had to cart them away in order to
prevent the live ones from climbing on top of the
corpses and leapfrogging into Queensland. Allan

yarn.
Queensland and Maoriland wouldn’t agree
to a reduction in the cable-rates, and yet their
cable revenue has come down smash. During
the four months of ’9O affected by the change, the
Queensland cable revenue dropped from £8462 to
£3775 ; that of Maoriland, from £14,892 to £8639.
Explanation : Their cable-users mail their cables
to agents in the cheap-cable provinces, for trans-
mission. Wanted—Federation.
Things were pretty brisk in Melbourne
last Sunday. A despondent gentleman named
Brabazon drowned himself in the Saltwater River,
which is an exceedingly dirty place for any man to
drown himself in. An individual in the currying
industry took carbolic acid, and pegged out. And
an unknown person jumped into the Yarra, but
changing his mind on the subject he climbed out
again, and cut his throat instead. Two men were
killed by a boiler explosion in the harbour, and a
corpse—supposed to be that of Power, ex-bush-
ranger—was fished out of the Murray. It wore a
satin waistcoat, anyhow, and that’s what Power
used to do.
“ God’s Galatea.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
As she moved amongst the crowd in
Collins-street that summer afternoon a passionate
voice broke out above the low murmur of homage.
“ Look at that girl, Drummond ; isn’t she lovely!
Who can she be ? ”
“ She is so beautiful she might be God’s Galatea,
She had moved out of hearing.
“Or”
“ Or the devil’s advance-agent ! ”
But she looked very womanly as she stopped
suddenly before a show-window and said :
“Oli,” Agnes, look at that bonnet! Isn’t it
wretched to bo as poor as we are ? ”
“Yes, but tee can’t help it, dear,” replied the
pretty little woman at her side ; “besides you
wouldn’t care to give .£lO for it, would you,
Eily ? ”
“ Ten pounds ! Why, Aggie, I’d—l’d sell my
soul for it, I believe ! ”
“ Oh, hush, dear, that gentleman must have
heard you. Let’s go home; he’s staring so rudely
at you.”
# # *
A cold, grey wintry forenoon. Two
figures hurrying down a south suburban street.
“ Oh, constable, do you think she’ll be dead ?”
“No, miss; doctor guv her twm hours. Ain’t
been ’arf that time yet.”
“I wonder if I’ll know her. It’s over a year
since I saw her last.” ■
“ Mebbe ye’ll find changes, then. She’s been
terrible ill, mind ye, miss.”
They Stopped before a cosy little villa, and,
poised on tip-toe, she looked through the window
of a warm, cheery room for an instant. Then the
tears blinded her. She had seen so much in that
moment—so much that seemed to draw the other
world close down to her heart. Unconsciously
she found her way in, and flung herself on the
bed. Her pitying'eyes looked longingly, lovingly
down on a wan, white face. Such a sad, pinched
face. Such large, heavy eyes. And very little
over a year had passed.
“I knew you'd, come, Aggie how terrible
that weak, sweet voice—“ I waited for you, dear.”
“Waited, Eily?”
“Yes, yes. I wouldn’t go till I had seen you.”
“Perhaps you needn’t go at all, Eily—not fo*
years and years. ”
“Don’t think that, Aggie. God is kind some-
times.”
“ God is kind always, Eily.”
“To you, dear; to those who are good and—
and don't want any help.”
“Oh, Eily, how you said that! If you have
wanted help why didn’t you send to me before ?”
“ Because I wanted it.”
“ Because-1 don’t understand.”
“No, you don’t —you can’t. Neither could 112
months ago.”
“Ah, yes, 12 months ago. You will tell me —I
want to know why you left me.”
“ You haven't guessed ?”
“No.”
“ Hasn’t anyone told you anything ?”
“ Eily, dear,’don’t mind it—no one has spoken
of you since.”
“ And didn’t that tell you anything?”
“ Nothing at all.”
“ What did you think I went away for ?”
“ I thought you must have got lost.”
“ I did, dear. I did get lost—and —and that’s
why I’m waiting to go now.”
“ Eily, how strangely you talk. Won’t you
rest yourself, dear? You forget how vreak you
are. ”
“ And you don’t know how weak I have been.
Aggie, there isn’t much more time for me here —
I shall have rest enough presently, so I will tell
you why I went away from you,”
“ I don’t want to know, dear, if —if it hurts
you. ”
“ It has hurt me for so long that I hardly feel
it now, Aggie. You remember the last day we
were in Collins-street together ? and the gentle-
man who made a remark about me? Well, I
Aggie, I was wrong; it does hurt—l —l went
away with him.”
“ Oh, I know now, Eily. You married him
and he died, and—and —”
“Look, Aggie!”—she held up her left hand —
“ you know now.”
Yes, she knew then. Her kisses and her tears
answered for her till her trembling voice whis-
pered :
“Eily, Eily, you were too good for that !”
“Too good, Aggie! I wish God had thought so.”
“ But, Eily, where is—7ie?”
“He was here this morning—just come from
burying the child—”
“The child! Oh, Eily !”
“ And he sent the constable to you.”
“Then, he is kind to you?”
“Yes, he is kind —so kind that when I said
that I wished my child could have had a grander
funeral, he told mo not to complain, as he would
see that I was buried magnificently enough for
both !”
“ Oh, Eily, how dreadful! And he called you
‘ God’s Galatea !’ But, tell me —he was a stranger
—why —how did you go away with him ?”
“ Don’t you remember that bonnet I admired
so much ? ”
“ That bonnet! Yes, but ■”
“ Well, almost at the same time as I received
the bonnet, I got a note, asking me to meet him—
and I went! ”
“ But, Eily, Eily, I gave you that bonnet! ”
“ You, Aggie ! ”
“ Yes, dear—-oh, why didn’t I tell you—you
wanted it so much, you said you’d sell your soul
for it! ”
“ I might have said body and soul, Aggie.”
“ And I’d saved a little money, you know, and
—oh, Eily, can you ever forgive me?”
“ Hush, don’t cry, Aggie. It was a mistake,
dear—it can’t be helped.”
“ But, if I had only told you ! ”
“It would have been just the same. I wanted
so many pretty things then, and you could not
have always given them to me.”
The end soon came.

Dear Bulletin, —W. T. Stead’s latest
journalistic psoriasis in the Review of Eeviewsls
a rash on ghosts. He states his position thus :
(1) he has never seen a ghost; (2) the existence of
ghosts is proved by the unbroken testimony of
mankind ; and (3) he would take a ghost-census
from among his readers. There is probably not a
man nor woman living who has ever been ill
enough to be light-headed, and who is endowed
with the least modicum of imagination, who has
not seen a ghost. If that doesn’t prove the
actuality of ghosts, it proves the existence of tem-
porarily unbalanced brains, anyway. And the
spectres exist —somewhere ! even if it be only
in a shatterpate’s fancy. The visions seen by
the jimjamee have a real existence for
him only. The unreal phantoms that escort
and attend the lunatic are veritably there
—as far as he is concerned. Who shall say
authoritatively that the cerebral eye “the
mind’s eye, Horatio” —can see a thing that has no
existence whatever, physical, spiritual, astral, or
psychic? To attempt to prove a negative is a
large order. It is all very well for a perfectly
healthy man to heave a brick at a ghost which he
thinks he sees, and find that it is a fellow dis-
guised as an apparition. I want to meet the man
who will heave an effectual brick at the spook
which he doesn’t see, but which I do. I will hail
such a man as a benefactor and borrow money
from him without shame. Further, can a horse
or a dog see a ghost, supposing a ghost to be
present? Some people say they can. I have
certainly seen dogs that were invisible to other
spectacles.—Yours, The Dipsomaniac.

The Bulletin has it, upon reliable

pecuniary difficulties have been so frequently
before the public, has been relieved of the duty of
presiding in civil cases, and will in future deal
only with criminal matters. Tims he will, to
some extent, be out of the reach of temptation.

Mr. C. H. Schon addresses the Kentish
Gazette (Canterbury, Eng.):—
Sir, —Having recently seen a summary of the will of
the late Dr. Beaney in your paper 1 was a little surprised
to find that although there were ricly benefactions to the
City bt Chntelbtlrj there was no mention of any provision
for some of his poor relations in the neighbourhood. I
have for many years known his only sister and family
andean vouch for the fact that they have been for years
in the receipt of “parochial relief !” One of Dr. Beaney’s
nephew’s—a man of weak mind—is at the present moment
an inmate of Bridge Union. The sister is a most respect-
able woman of about 70 years. I hope this may meet
the eye of somebody who will be able to get her into one
of the Canterbury Almshouses. The llev. H. Wardell,
Bekesbourne Vicarage, is conversant with the facts of
the case and will be happy to give any information
regarding it.
After this, is there any city, Church, of public
institution mean enough to touch a penny of the
dead butcher’s leprous money ?

From the Hawaiian Gazette (Honolulu),
9th June, 1891 :
NOTICE.
I THE UNDERSIGNED, hereby notify Mr. Hanale,
police of Kaupo, Maui, and Mr. Kike, of Nuu,
never to come near my dwelling-house, cook-house,
and outhouses. I cannot, nor do I debar them from
bntering my school-house, for they are patehtS and
have children going to school; nor do I debar them
from going as far as the letter-delivery box. But if
they ever dare to make approaches to my wife, as
they have done to two other married women-viz.,
entering the bedroom, giving them gin, embracing,
kissing, and the like, during the absence of the wives’
husbands, I will shoot them dead sure.

missed the case, from which we assume that he

One of the leaders of Hot Tong, in a
Certain southern town wo know of, is a stout lady
with a great waste and wilderness of —ahem
chest. Her evening-dress is a trifle tight, and the
—not to put too fine a point upon it - chest slops
over the top of the dress, in a manner of speaking.
Consequently, any one meeting her for the first
time is surprised to find himself introduced to
such a very large amount of woman and such a
very small amount of clothing. The other day
there was a sassiety function of some sort in
progress, mid the lady in question, who is
a heavy eater, was consuming some jelly.
She tried to insert a No. 12 spoonful of the com-
pound into a No. 10 mouth, and the natural
result was that the provender fell. It lauded
right on her chest, and stayed there. The lady
looked at the empty spoon in search of the lost
eatable ; next she looked at tho floor to see if it
was there; then she fixed her blue eyes on her
chest, and discovered it. It was a trying moment,
and a thrill went through the crowd as she sat
there with the unstable provisions tottering on
their unstable basis. But she rose to the occasion,
and chasing the grub with her spoon she promptly
feboVered it. Then she gently raised the spoon
with both hands, opened her mouth to its widest
extent we are called away by important busi-
ness at this moment, and have to leave the narra-
tive unfinished.

A domestic servant, in the employ of a

shortly afterwards, the amount was tendered

told was deducted in payment for—one kitten.
It seemed that the old black cat which used to

added to the feline population, and the girl had
given one of its progeny to a friend.

The Gilbeys are now pushing the sate of

that the firm of Burgoyno and Co., who

made to encourage the consumption of native
wines in this country, is the sale in some of the

A little podgy Government official out in
far north-West N.S,W, had his-small, fat dignity
trodden on the o'thef day, He got a telegram
from a policeman addressed simply “ J. Blank,”
and he rode 22 miles in search of the offender and
raised a tumult with him for not adding “Esq,”
The officer exp’aiued- that he had inserted the
“ Esq.” and it had been lost in tho telegraph-
office —which always loses the “Esq.”—and there-
upon the podgy one bolted for the telegraph
premises and demanded to know why the Gehenna
his “Esq. ” hadn’t been forwarded. The man in
charge said it had been left out to save time, and
the official said “Damn!” and demanded an
apology, and the operator told him to keep his
hair on. And now the back-blocks potentate is
writing long letters to the Government requiring
the instant dismissal of the telegraph-man, and
there is such a fearful row in the far north-west
that nobody dare even think of him without
putting “Esq.” to his name in his thoughts, and
the drunken bushman who swears at him says
“Dash J. Blank, Esq. !”

Toothbrushes are the insignia and cogni-
zance of gentility in Australian gaols, just as high-
necked dresses are the undoubted indication of
chastity in young society dames. No “silver-
tail ” of any ton to speak of is without one of these
little toilet appurtenances. It at once affords a
passport to the society of the bank-defaulter, the
land-boomer, the auctioneer who has sold crags on
heaven-kissing hills under the name of surveyed
allotments, and chevaliers d'industrie in general.
Some of those who polish their gums under the
taps were as dubious at first as to the real utility
of the toothbrush as was the American gentleman
who borrowed one for the purpose of beautifying
his toenails. Thus it is that in gaol may be
watched the evolution of the dude from the yahoo;
the demonstration of the thesis that culture pro-
ceeds from simian imitativeness. When an
expiree is on the eve of departure, he is besought
not to write his friends a letter from home, or to
perform any other sentimental eccentricity, but to
leave at the gate under the name of a relative a
new toothbrush, which becomes a marketable
medium of exchange for terbacker. A new tooth-
brush is worth three “figs” on the time-payment
principle.

Though the Melbourne coal-supply has to
be imported from Sydney, the price of gas in
Melbourne (where the works return a big profit)
is ever so much lower than in Sydney. Why ?
Simply because gas-supply has always been a
monopoly in Sydney, whereas the Melbourne
prices have been regulated through long competi-
tion between companies which have now amalga-
mated. If Parliament pass an electric-lighting
bill in favour of the Sydney Gas Co. —or any
other private ring— it will be simply slitting the
public carotid. The lighting of Sydney should be
controlled by the municipality, and if the citizens
own the electric-light they can keep the gas com-
pany where it ought to be—right under the whip.
It is a recognised fact that everybody
should be very careful in selecting his parents; if
be isn’t careful, and rashly engages a father with-
out examining the old man’s credentials, he often
gets one who is utterly unfitted for the place, and
then there is trouble. A young and haughty nob,
in a Victorian Government office, who had given
two unpresentable people a job as his ancestors,
found out the irreparable nature of his mistake
the other day. He was the usual type of a nice-
looking Civil Service young man, with a shiny
hat and shiny boots, and a flower in his button-
hole; but his father was simply awful. The old
progenitor was short and stertorous and hairless ;
he used to perspire and steam on the slightest
provocation, and mop himself up with a cotton-
handkerchief ; his legs were curly, and his ignor-
ance was something phenomenal. Also, the
youth’s mother was objectionable, and flat-footed,
and they looked somehow as if they had made
their money by carting dirt on a large scale.
Therefore, the gilded son seldom invited his
friends home ; he had tried it once, and his cordial
father shook hands with the visitor till they both
perspired furiously with the exertion, and wanted
him to have a gin and a clay-pipe, and after that
he practically repudiated the curly predecessor,
and cast him off. But after a time the young
man was engaged to be married, and the
object of his passion wanted to see her
future mother-in-law. He staved her off
for a while, till at last he couldn’t postpone
the thing any longer. Then he had visions of the
brawny male parent squashing his nice girl in a
hairy embrace, and the mother —who looked
dreadfully like an apoplectic washerwoman—
pawing her with two big red hands ; and the idea
made him curse. While he was cursing, however,
a great inspiration came upon him—an inspiration
that made him give three cheers in his bed-room
for sheer exultation.
He rushed out and took a furnished
house to begin with. Then he hunted up a retired
actress of his acquaintance—a nice, elderly lady
with silvery hair —and engaged her to fill the billet
of his mother for the time being. Next, it was
decided that it would make the best girl feel more

A MEMORY.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Adown the grass-grown paths we strayed,
The evening cowslips ope’d
Their yellow eyes to look at her,
The love-sick lilies moped
With envy that she rather chose
To lake acreamy-pelalled rose
And lean it ’gainst her ebon hair,
All in that garden fair.
A languid breeze, with stolen scent
Of box-bloom in his grasp,
Sighed out his longing in her car,
And with his dying gasp
Scattered the perfume at her feet
To blend with others not less sweet;
lie loved her, but she did not care.
All in that garden fair.
The rose she honoured nodded down,
The others burst with Spite}
Toor fool, he knew not he was doomed
To barely last the night ;
Are hearts to her but like that flower,
The plaything of a careless hour,
To lacerate and never spare
All in that garden fair ?
I held her hand that I might trace
Her fortune in its palm ;
A holder moonbeam than the vest
Crept up and kissed her ami,
And kissing once was loth to leave,
So hid himself within the sleeve
That clasped the lithe arm, white and bare,
All in that garden fair.
I traced her fortune: love and wealth,
Tho’ life, alas ! was short,
But will that wealth be bought with love?
Or love with wealth be bought ?
I know not, knowing only this—•
Her hand seemed waiting for a kiss,
I longed to, hut I did not dare
All in that garden fair.
But she, alas ! is not for mo,
And I am not for her ;
Yet ever deep down in ray thoughts
A faint regret must stir
A thrill of longing—that among
Those moon-lit paths with lover’s tongue
1 might return, and woo her there
All in that garden fair.

Efforts Wore made to got a presentable father, bu
the only one who could bo found was a comic
Wan out of a show, and his expression, was sO
awful that it was considered better that the
father should be from homo Oil Urgent business.
A gentlemanly-looking individual from a Govern-
ment office arranged to call in casually during the
evening and be am Uncle, and the party was
complete. They made a nice looking family—
the sort of family any girl would bo glad to marry
into- and the nefarious scheme succeeded admi-
rably. Which shows, as already mentioned, that
the slop or ready-made parent is a dead failure,
and nobody should engage him, except after care-
ful inquiry as to his fitness for the job. The real
mother in this case would have hugged the girl
and breathed onions on her, but the temporary
one passed a white hand caressingly over her
soft, brown hair, and said she was pleased to have
such a daughter. The two bogus sisters wore
confidential with her, and kissed her joyfully;
the/illeged father sent a telegram, saying lie was
sorry he couldn’t gut home ; and the hired uncle
was immense* But how the thing will bo ex-
plained in the end, we really don’t know.

aged from eight up to sixteen. We hereby
inform Mr. Barnes that we can lend him about
400 good, healthy, upstanding boys who now
write letters to The Bulletin on a large variety
of subjects, and if Mr. Barnes will take them over
he is welcome to them. Most of them write about
the Melbourne Cup, or else want to know the

the rest are anxious for information about John

The individual who said that man’s sin
would always find him out forgot to add that it
was quite sure to find him out at the most unsuit
able moment. For instance, a fashionable sort of
man got married the other day, in a fashionable
Sydney suburb, and he and his bride went to
their elegant home replete with all modern con-
veniences. But nearly half the night another
womati kept pounding ferociously on the back-
door and demanding to be let "in. She had
climbed over the back fence, and she positively
refused to climb out again, and for some reason or
other the bridegroom seemed to feel embarrassed
about sending for the police, and only ventured
to remonstrate feebly from the window. But
when he remonstrated the female below only
addressed him hilariously as “Johnnie,” and
urged hmi more strongly to let her in, and leaped
joytuiiy a t the door with a broom-handle. She
was a fattish sort of woman, with a blue dress
splashed with grease, and damaged boots, and a
hat with a broken-backed feather in it, and
altogether not at all the sort of female whom any
nn^ n -Y 0 ?.*" to have leaping and screaming
outside his back-door on his wedding-night. The
pride couldn t sleep on account of the racket, and
it wasn t till four o’clock that the visitor lost her

A fashionable draper was badly walloped
he other day. He is a loathsome indiviuald
n a large way of business, and has several dozen
giids—tlie Majority being young and good-looking
.i*' Ida employment. Most of them aro orphans.
With no big reliable male relativts whom they can
employ to smash the draper when ho casts his bad
green eye upon them, lie is a fatherly importer,
and when a good-looking girl wants a billet he
promptly sacks the oldest and ugliest female ill
the place to make room for her, Theh ho begins
to take a kindly interest hi hob, dnd after that he
proposes m a Christian spirit tb send her out into
the country for the benefit of her health at his
OWn expense, and after t/ia —— Girls disappeitt
rapidly in that establishment, SOmtehoiv-, and they
mostly go away in a sad, broken-,spirited sort of

and sometimes they simply vanish. But the other
clay, when the boss engaged a new orphan of 19 or
ro, be struck the worst snag* of his whole life, for
rp bv led to ascertain that she iiad a brother,
.therefore it came to pass that when he softly
took her aside one evening, and asked her if she
would like to go into the country for the benefit
of her constitution, abd she left hurriedly and in
tears, ho didn’t guess what was going to happen.
But presently a young man—a peaceful-looking
one with a flower in his coat—looked in and asked
for Mr. - . “I am the person,” said the im-
porter with a Christian smile. Next moment
his hat was driven down with an awful smash
over his eyes, and ho got a fearful plug ill the
nose that drove him backwards against the wall
and then a wild balls t>ri the lower jaw made his
month Mint suddenly just as he was in the midst
m a yell. After that there was frantic confusion,
foi the importer and the brother were bounding
all over the office, and in the conflict the boss’s
countenance was scrubbed with the ruins of his
hat, and lie was welted in every direction with a
walking-stick, and lie was driven head first into

over, and the victim aWoke ftom his dream, he
was a battered nlih sitting on the floor and

A certain great Sydney financier, well-

A small Melbourne publication fell into
the droll error of supposing that the antediluvian
Marchioness of Ailesbury, who died the other
day, was the wife of the reprobate at present
•ngaged in pawning the family estates. As
a matter of fact, it was probably old Maria,
one of the other Marchionesses of A., who
yielded *up her worn-out ghost. With Maria
disappears the most extraordinary figure (not
even excepting the Duchess of Montrose)
seen on English racecourses during the last 25
years. Looking at this frisky fossil, it was diffi-
cult to believe that she hadn’t been bought in a
toy-shop and set going by steam. Hair, teeth,
complexion, eyebrows, figure—everything about
Maria was a caricature of human nature. She
looked 200 at the least, and yet she would hop,
skip, and jump around the royal enclosure
at Ascot, Goodwood, and elsewhere like a
marionette gone mad. Tummy used to tickle his
jaded senses by holding animated discussions
with this bag of antiquity, and when the old girl
was in her best form you might see her corkscrew
curls fluttering amongst the creme dc la creme of
sassiety. Maria was in truth the Mrs. Skewton
of the old nobility, an irrepressible scarecrow—
an object to laugh at, weep over, or write essavs
upon. Heaven and Sir Bernard Burke alone
know what relationship she held to the present
head of the family-probably that of grandmother
or great-great aunt. It is believed that she highly
disapproved of the young man, anyway, and had
of late refused to recognise him on earth. Con-
sidering, however, that Maria was herself n god-
less accumulation of pomps and Vanities, making
her betting-book her Bible* there is every reason
to suppose that she Will, ultimately find herself
hobnobbing with the markisin another and hotter
clime.

This is th'd tale of a weak woman. A
Sydney mutual improvement society of two —to
wit a widow and a man —lately tried to run a
little paradise on the pristine Adam and Eve
unmarried lines. But the “Elysian theory worked
badly, and utterly broke down when the modern
Eve brought an action for wages as housekeeper,
and explained that her unlawful loVe had kicked
her out into the street. The unchivalric Judge
gave a Verdict for defendant, so outside the court
the persecuted widow went for the man she once
had fondly loved. With the very lips that a few
months ago had whispered the shy, sweet confes-
sion, she now swore to show him up and to tear
his heart out, fche broke his nose and blackened
his eyes with the delicate hand, which—oh, sad
remembrance I—he had pressed against his thrtlb-
bing heart, and had kissed, and had called his own.
She broke o’er his greasy but noble brow the
gamp that she had bought with “ pettie’s ’’money
the morning after the day when they should have
been married. Then she burst into tears, and sat
down on a doorstep and poured out her sorrows to
the cheap audience. She said she was only a
woman, and another victim of men, but it didn’t
matter because she only was a woman* and slm
hoped the Lord Would forgive him. Then she
commenced tb pray in a sing-song voice, and the
battered Adam started to shuffle down the street.
She followed, vowing that she loved him still, as
only a woman could, and that she’d never, never
forsake him. He didn’t look back, and she,
thinking that he might like to know where she
was, picked up hunks of blue metal* and let
’im ’ave ’em on the ’ed td apprise him of
her, Most women can’t throw
Straight, but this woman was on the wicke^
every time, and put ’em in with a force and
regularity suggestive of a thunderbolt, playing at
intervals of a second on a granite rock. With
one quarry she sent his cadie soaring heaven-
wards, and it landed on a verandah-roof, but he
was too stunned to miss it, and he hobbled on,
because it was the only iiotion he had. After a
while the back of the brutish master’s head began
to look as if it had been vanquished in a dozen
dog-fights, and ultimately he drifted a helpless
wreck through an open office-door, and fell down
in the hope that he’d soon die. She sat down
on the pavement to weep afresh, and after
fifteen minutes’ anguish, she arose, still sobbing,
and went to cook the dinner, and to make things
hot generally, in anticipation of the monster’s
return.

English sassiety was thrilled through and

Amongst recent marriages, in England, of
people connected with Australia was that of Miss
Hose Mylrea, eldest daughter of Mr. F. Garland
Mylrea, for many years well known in Sydney,
where ho was long in business as a broker. He
married cn second noccs the widow of Peter
Stuckey, who owned considerable N.S.W. and
Victorian station property. She had two children
a son and daughter, by Peter, who were lost in the
wreck of the Loch Ard,”and the property re-
verted to her second family, who in this
unexpected way, came in for Stuckey’s money.
Mrs. Mylrea is a sister of Curtis Read, whose name
was a household word in the cricket world years
ago. Miss Mylrea’s husband is a Mr. Mayhew, a
Suffolk solicitor in large practice.

The late parson Hayden of St. John’s,
Darlinghlirst, Sydney, was an enthusiastic fisher-
man, alia spent a great deal of his tittlb afloat.
He used to fish outside Sydney Heads with a
man named W ,of Manly Beach, still extant,
who was a bit of a psalm-singer and amateur
preacher. _ They were on one occasion somewhere
on the wide ground, when a southerly buster
overtook them. It was a case of up kellick and
scud home, but the skiff being weighted with fish
laboured heavily, and was in some danger of
filling; W—— began to improve the occasion, and
reminded the parson of what a terrible thing it
would be were they suddenly called to their last
account. The rev. gentleman brought him up with
a round turn. “Look here, W , just attend
to your own business and leave the praying to
me. You look after the sheet. One parson’s
enough in the boat;”
• • 4 * ■ .
Mr. Hayden’s love for , the “ gentle
art ” was once the cause of considerable in-
convenience to two ladies. One of them, then
recently married, had invited a friend to spend
the day with her at Manly. It was proposed
that they should indulge in an alfresco bath, and
they went out for that purpose. Lunch time
arrived, but they had not returned. One o’clock,
three, four o’clock passed without sign of them.
The husband naturally became alarmed at his
wife’s long absence, and a search-party was
organised to scour thecdastJinei but uuavailingly.
In deep despair the husband returned ib tlib
bouse, where, to his joy, he found the wife and
her friend safe and sound. The spot they had
chosen for their bath was a secluded rock on the
Lagoon, where they undressed free from vulgar
gaze. They entered the water and swam some
little distance, when, to their horror, they saw a
man come close to the spot where they had left
their clothes. He proceeded to divest himself of
his iiether garments, keeping on only his coat.
He then Unpacked his fishing tackle and, having
hoisted ah Umbrella over his head, walked into
the Water ds far d& he fiould Without Wettihg the
tail bf his Coat. Here he remained for several
hours, whilst the girls shivered in the water
praying fervently that he would die suddenly or
go away. At fast, having exhausted iiis patience,
ho put on his togs and departed. That fisherman
was the Reverend Mr. Hayden.

At the present time great changes are
coming about in the social status of mankind, A
man is not nowa days Considered tl god; beballse
his father Was a clever usurer or merchant. It is
becoming a recognised fact that all men arc equal
—as men and have each the right to enjoy life’s
blessings to an equal degree. In the past it lias
always been the aim of the rich to grind down the
poor, and as the latter had but one
starvation—they were compelled to be thankful
for what they could get. But now education is
opening men’s eyes to the fact that mankind could
enjoy much more pleasure and comfort if such
large shares of the world’s wealth were not
annexed by the few. The day of a great indus-
trial revolution is at hand, and a brighter and
better future is in store for us both socially and
financially, and whilst paying attention to these
great interests it is also essential to take par-
ticular care of our physical well-being. An all-
seeing providence has so constituted the human
frame that the brain is immediately informed of
any organic derangement; a simple headache is a
sign that the liver is deranged, or that the nervous
system is weakened, which, if neglected, continues
to decline; the nervous tissues waste away and
completely collapse, and a fatal termination
frequently results. Herr Otto Franzen, Adelaide,
S.A., writes:—“ I was taken with a sudden fit
whilst dressing one morning last February, and
fell on the iron bedstead and cut my temple open
which bled profusely; the fall completely stunned
me, and I was unconscious for hours. My family
procured medical assistance, and I got somewhat
better in about a fortnight; but ever since the
accident I suffered tortures from nervous head-
aches and neuralgia and weakness. I tried all the
best doctors in this city and Melbourne for these
troubles, all to no purpose. I was almost dis-
tracted with pain, and applied to another doctor,
and he recommended Clements Tonic, saying that
my nervous system was prostrated with the shock,
and that Clements Tonic would rebuild my
constitution. I was rather doubtful, but procured
a bottle, and felt better with the second dose. I
continued its use, and am thankful I did, for I
truly believe I should have been in a madhouse
long ago if I had not used it, and I am really
grateful, for my sufferings were intense, and
doctors could not cure me, but Clements Tonic
did, therefore it deserves my gratitude.”

One rebels against the sickly last words
reported of dying persons, but there is nothing
nauseous about the expiring words of a mother in
Port Melbourne last week : “ See that my boy gets
his dinner in time.”
Ex-Governor Carington recently told a
pleasant yarn about a time when he and Wales
went slumming together in St. Paneras :—
The landlord of the premises guided them into a room,
fireless and furnitureless, where a mother and three
children lived, the children being naked. The guide
asked the mother where the third was. “I don’t know.
I have not seen it since I was in court a fortnight ago,”
replied the mother, evidently quite unconcerned as to
the fate of her offspring. “ What on earth are we to do,”
asked the landlord, “ with people of this sort?”
The story ended there, from which it is evident
that Tummy, standing vacantly by, with his
corporation jammed in the doorway, gave the
problem up and went away to his little game to
baccarat.
“So long as I am a parson, so long will I
help the weak against the strong,” recently said
Rev. W. E. Hillier. Hillier had better come
right out of the fold. His brother shepherds
won’t recognise him if he adopts that programme.
What has it profited him, yet? For years he
toiled at Blackall without any certain stipend,
and lived on less than a Chinaman. The Church,
while taking to itself any credit he gained, ignored
if it did not disown him. Let him either grease
the fat pig and be a parson, or quit the white-
necktie contingent and be simply a radical re-
former. Run for Parliament, Hillier, if you like,
and, while being able to effect some good for the
masses there, you will be sure of your monthly
screw, at any rate.
According to Minister Cowley, of Banana-
land, a frequent trick of Polynesian pearl-divers
up at Thursday Island and adjacent ports is to
palm off upon passengers on mail steamers
“lizards’ eggs ” as “ pearls.”
Dear Bulletin, —Your Northern corres-
pondent is certainly correct as to the buffaloes
having found their way east to Queensland, but it
scarcely bears out his argument as to the tendency
or cattle to travel east, as he has omitted to
mention that buffaloes have also strayed from
Port Essington westward. I have seen more than
one pair of horns in native camps on the lower
Daly, and they have been seen on the Victoria.
I suppose as many have wandered west as east,
but coming eastward they got into more settled
country, and were consequently noticed. Stray
cattle, both in Northern Queensland and the
Territory, nearly always make south-east. This
miy arise from many of them having come from
that direction as “stores,” but more probably,
from the fact that the prevailing wind, for nine
months in the year, is south-east, and cattle, like
many other animals, when left to themselves,
always travel against the wind. — Delcomyn.
As showing the feeling which must exist
against the N.S. W. reserve rifle companies on the
part of the local military authorities it may be
mentioned that though the companies, all told,
now consist of from 5000 to 6000 men, each com-
pany, no matter whether its strength be 12, 20 or
100 members, is supplied by Government with but
twelve rifles. These are distributed by ballot and
the unsuccessful men have to use an obsolete
weapon (the Henry rifle) which the State issues, or
buy Martinis, at an expense of £2 18s. each. From
time to time it has been asked in Parliament why
Government refuse to supply rifles to the reserve 3 ,
and it is invariably replied that the province’s
stand of new arms must be kept up to a certain
figure. On the other hand, the senior cadets (who,
after all, are only boys) have as many good rifles
served out to them as they want. They have only
to ask and the arms are immediately provided.
Notwithstanding all the obstacles put by Govern-
ment in the way of the reserve rifles, these com-
panies are the real strength of the province, and
carried off most of the prizes at the recent rifle-
meeting;. They have to spend on an average
£6 for rifle and uniform, and all that is given by
Government is £1 for efficiency, which benefits no
individual but goes to the company’s common
fund.
One old friend and patron was dying last
week and wished to bid us an eternal farewell.
So we went to him and found him lying in a
darkened room, his once round and ruddy face
thin and ghastly, collapsed, waxen; his breath
coming and going in gasps and sobs; his eyes
faded ; his feet swollen with the dropsy which
firoclaimed the failure of his brave old heart ; his
ips half-paralysed; his teeth showing as show
the teeth of the dead man in his coffin : his pallid,
wasted hands lying nerveless outside the coverlet.
“I am sentenced to death,” said he, “and I am
glad to die. I have come to the lane which has
no turning, and don’t care how soon I get to the
end of it.” “Well, old fellow,” we said, knowing
him to be one who looked the inevitable squarely
in the face, and on whom honeyed words of hope
would be wasted— have little cause to
grumble. You have the consolation of knowing
that you leave your family fairly well pro-
vided for.” “That’s all right!” exclaimed the
dying man, “so I have, but it has been at the
expense of hard work and never-ending worry—
even up to now none of them have even been able
to relieve me for one instant of business care.
My youngsters will get a good start, but,” —here
he fairly snorted with disgust—“ they are no
f:ood. Not one of them have ever had to work
ike you and me, and the result is that not one of
them is worth his salt—no go or energy in them—
an utterly useless lot, except Michael, that boy ”
—(pointing to a curly-haired youth of seventeen,
who sat reading at the other side of a window).
“ Michael is an exception.” “ Ah, well,” we said,
“ they are none of them very old yet, and it must
console you to know that you have one, at least,
one good boy.” “Yes,” said the dying father,
with a grim smile, “Michael is the exception.
The rest are spendthrifts, wasters, fools, for which
the evils of the day are sufficient. Michael is a
provident boy. He saves, saves, saves, spends
nothing during eleven months out of the twelve.
He is always saving, saving— saving, saving up
for the Melbourne Cup ! ” And thus ends the
story of the dying Australian father.

Some years ago a certain spiritualist-
lecturer (now a prominent politician) was to give
in Sydney a trance lecture on “ England’s rela-
tions with Turkey.” After all the preliminaries
had been gone through and the lecturer had been
duly switched on to the medium, the chairman
arose to explain that the young man whom they
saw before them was now in communication with
somebody in spirit land, and was completely un-
conscious and oblivious to all external sensations,
etc., and that he would now proceed to give his
trance lecture on “ England’s relations with
Russia.” “No, no, hang it, man, not Russia,
Turkey!" ejaculated the medium—the man who had
gone out of himself. The audience “bit” and
that lecture didn’t come off.
How often have we mashed the girls,
And deemed them bond fide pearls,

Their teeth were false, their busts were bogus,
Their hair and bloom combined to rogue us,
Their wealth a blind.

In fact, the “ pearls” were “lizards’-eggs !”
But never mind!
We’ll try again to find a pearl,
Some day we'll get an actual girl,

SPORTING NOTIONS.
If the Melbourne Cup were to be run over
again next week the ’hooks would probably lay 5 to 2
against Malvolio repeating the trick, seeing that he
proved unable in the All-Aged Stakes to make a conces-
sion yf-nine pounds on their original handicap to High-
born, thelourth in the Gup. No line of reasoning can
make the form ’look quite up to the average, or upset
the aI gu merit that Carbine, fit and well, would have
donkey-uclted this year’s field with the same ease as of
!Py>rt|i»R- writers, indeed, have represented
&ir Wilhaih as a great performer, and even maintained
that, with Bravo s weight on his back, he was the jMck of
the handicap. It is difficult to understand, save under a
moat sinister theory, how a somewhat cobby horse, with
only lour -wins, as against sixteen “ nowheres,” to his
oredit in ths calendar, could be a good thing for the
biggest vw&vtthf y and as Sir William was a close
ninner-up, the inferenge is that alvery shag-bag or ill-
conditioned lot of animals(always excepting Strathmore,
the and Highbolrn, who carried 35 pounds
niore, Vet gbt iiearer to* tjie wiWer, than last year) must
have finished behind him.’ Strathmore, again, scored a
third i” than Australian Peer did in Dunlop’s
ygar. Nine people opt of ten, We fancy, will be disposed
J O ,. ink The Peer, with Niagara and Abercorn
behind him, a more brilliant Derby winner than
Strath more-ergo, Dunlop, at Bst. 31b., was a better horse
than Malvolio at a pound more. As for Mentor, another
Bst. 31b. Cup winner, he had previously won the Caulfield
Stakes, and run second for the Melbourne Stakes two
races in which Malvolio finished far behind Marvel and
Bungebah. How could backers put their whole trust in
the son of Malua and Madcap, except on the strength of
his trainer’s opinion, which has been proved fallible many
a time and oft? Malvolio, as a three-year-old, beat High-
born at an advantage of 91b. in the weights, which was
something to stand upon. But then, a week later, Car-
bine gave the one-eyed veteran a more decisive beating
and 391 b. into the bargain. However, no matter what
may be the exact degree of excellence in the “form ” one
good old moral adorns the story of 1891 Melbourne Cup.
Only racehorses, and not ordinary-looking animals with
no proved merit to recommend them, are worth backing
for the event. Malvolio was a well-bred and imposing-
looking animal anyway, the most likely winner to the eye
that walked in the paddock before the race. Sir William
had run, at one time or another, well over all distances,
and under heavy weights, whilst Strathmore represented
the “crack” of his year. They were, at least, three
“right uns, and they gave touts and prophets another
lesson on the vanity of running after second-raters of the
Pi geo n toe stamp at the last minute. Melbourne sporting
papers, printing Anal selections before the race, broke out
in veritable rashes (suitable word) of “ plumps ” for
Pigeontoe, a plebeian monster with deformed fore-legs,
who was correctly reckoned up in The Bulletin’s report
from Melbourne, after he had won the Hotham Handicap.
« * *
Paris had gone considerably “ off-colour ” before
The Bulletin tip was published. Under the circum-
stances, his foremost position for 1J miles in the Cup and
subsequent victory in the Veteran Stakes were a surprise
to many people. There was a flat, stale, and unprofitable
appearance about the horse all the week.

Joe Thompson, writes a Bulletin correspon-
dent from London, has been waking up the Victoria Club
and recalling old times by the extent of his wagering on
future events. The “jockeys’ ring “ had nearly done for
ante-post betting, and most of the business for the last
three years has been S.P. Joe, however, determined to
change all that, and accordingly opened big hooks on the
Leicester Handicap, the Ciosarewitch and Cambridgeshire
He laid any number of wagers in thousands. His pluck
has already been deservedly rewarded, and he has had a
fair “skinner” over the Leicester event, which was won
by an unbacked outsider, Rusticus, the property of that
unlucky sportsman, Mr. Hamar Bass. Joe, who must
have landed a very large sum over that win, is also doing
a big business in double events on the two big back-end
handicaps. He is not adding to his popularity with the
English bookmaking fraternity by doing this.

They were partners in a pub. at Newmericarra,
and introduced the seductive game of hazard. The
hoys thought it considerably better than Yankee grab
especially as they had been winning. But one fatal
night, when there was a big school on, the partners
rung in a clyner,” and the way the boys went down was
dreadful to see. One battler, after droppinglall he had,
bet on the nod to the extent of £3O. On being pressed
for a settlement he handed over the title-deeds of a town-
ship allotment. Just then Father Mick called and
solicited a donation for the bazaar. “ Let’s give him the
block of land, Jack which was readily assented to by
the other partner. The Holy Fathers were so piously
elated that they invited the publicans to the presbytery
in the evening to have a glass of wine. A game of nap
was suggested, just to pass away an hour, you know. . .
“How much did that allotment cost us, Jack? £3O.
And how much did we win at the presbytery last night ?
£6O. Well, I think I’ll go to Melbourne to-day and give
Nation an order for a special brew.”

Recently the Age whined that no less than
£20,000 per annum of Victorian money was sent out of
the province for investment in Sydney sweeps. The post-
office authorities never suggest the possibility of any
money coming back to the unhappy Cabbage Garden in
the form of prizes. Why, the number of Melbourne and
Ballarat men who have just won fortunes, according to
rumour, in Sydney sweeps is positively legion. The same
remark applies to Sydney and most other towns. Read-
ing newspapers for a few days after the Cup always fills
the human mind with a hearty disgust for toil and
trouble. Why work when Tattersall and the rest of Aus-
tralia’s benefactors are waiting to throw untold gold at
everybody who buys a ticket of admission to Tom
Tiddler's ground ? Better to lay out your sovereign and
retire from business on your good luck.

Joe Thompson, writes our correspondent, ought
surely to receive a testimonial from English backers, fo r
the other bookies have fairly “ taken the needle ” since
he commenced to show them what Australian mettle is.
Men who would open their eyes if asked to lay odds to
a couple of thousand will now stand to any amount. Joe
laid at Leicester the big wager of £33,600 to £2400
against the French colt, Ermak, for the Csesarewitch.
It is said that Joe would have to cover no less than
£lOO,OOO should Chesterfield win the Csesarewith, so
heavily had that colt been backed in double events. (One
of the papers prints a story that Joseph dropped £36,000
over the Csesarewitch meeting.) Brother Barney is much
smaller potatoes. He is a simple turf-commissioner, but
is doing pretty well at that elastic game. He has a good
office in Jermyn-street, right in the heart of St. James’,

A certain N.S.W. small boy—aged
11 years—is in trouble over the Caulfield
Cup. He got the straight tip that G’Naroo
was the coming animal—according to his own
story he found his school-teacher backing the
horse, but this is a mere detail. Thereupon
he went straight home, buist his money-box
with an axe, and put the contents on G’Naroo
in one act. When he won, and collected the
proceeds—some £3O or so—he grew alarmed
lest his enraged parent might drop to the
state of the money-box, so he laid the matter
before his big brother, and asked him to
repair that receptacle. The brother repaired
the box, put back in it the original amount,
whaled the young speculator on high moral
grounds, and' confiscated the winnings with
a promise to pay them over when the
spanked and weeping owner should have
reached the age of 21. So far as we know
the big brother isn’t going to pay any in-
terest on the money, so that, through his
morality, he gets the use of £3O for ten
la , gratis. Also, there is no security,
and the way the coin was extracted looks
remarkably like assault and batten', high-
way robbery, and undue influence with
violence. The stern parent or the moral big
brother who confiscates the small boy’s
gambling-money from purely religious
motives is a mean cuss, anyhow, for he
always sticks to the cash, and always snuffles
about it as if he had done a noble act in
taking the battered infant’s property.

George Adams, of Sydney Tatter-

himself in a position to gratify his artistic
cravings, and proposes to decorate his new
ana splendid bar in a manner unexampled

commissioned Mr. J. R. Ashton to paint for
him twelve figures, representing the Months
at a price, it is said, of about £lOOO. The
Months, it need hardly be said, are all ladies,
and some of them have very little clothes on.

The Old Man’s Welcome.
(A Sequel to “ The Shame of Going Back ” in a
recent “ Bulletin.”)
So you’ve been a bit unlucky, and your clashed hard up,
And you blame “ Humiliation ” and his “ poisoned cup ’’;
And “your heart is in a shadow?” Why, you must be
drunk !
Light the fire and boil the billy while I fix your bunk.
There's very little doing here,"but don’t yon fret:
There is plenty junk and damper in the gin-case yet.
What tlie devil set 3-011 rhyming ? Your’re a damn’d fool
Jack !
Never talk about the sorrow of a coming back ;
You have had a lot of trouble, but the “pome” was
worst,
And you never thought of coming- to the old man first.
You’ll deserve the “frowns of Fortune,” you’ll deserve
her licks,
If you go without a dinner while the o’.d man kicks.
I am mighty glad to see you, for the boys are gone,
And it’s lonely in the humpy when the night comes on ;
There’s a pipe and good tobacco on the corner shelf,
There’s a sprinkle in the bottle you must help yourself.
I will hunt .you up a billet, Jack, but don’t forget
That there’s plenty junk and damper in the gin-case yet.
Sydney, Oct., 1891.
HENRY LAWSON.
Old Tom Gardiner, who died the other day
at Hobart, Ta*., at the age of 92 years, first
arrived in V.D.L. in 1820, per ship Guildford, and
got a billet as valet to Col. H.ivey, the then
Governor. Gardiner was afterwards Chief Justice
Pedder’s “ man,” and, later still, slid into a billet
as court crier, which position ho “Oyez’d”for 40
y<an, till dimness of sight and other infirmities
stiauded him on to the pension-list.
There is to be erected in Broadway, New
York, U.S.A., what will be the highest building
for ordinary business purposes in the world. Its
altitude will be 550 feet, a height only exceeded
by two monumental structures, the Eiffel Tower,
in Paris, and the Washington Monument. The
edifice will be constructed throughout of steel and
will contain exactly 1000 offices, distributed
amongst a huge pile of storeys too trouble-
some to count. The building will contain a
solid bottom —be constructed, in fact, to form
one jointed whole—which will give scope for the
ingenuity of artificial sensations, or for the
humorous effects of passing earthquakes. Thus,
if the mechanicians can produce screw-jacks
powerful enough to lift the structure bodily, it
can be “unevened” to represent the Leaning
Tower of Pisa, or it can be lassooed near the top
and hauled over on to its side, or caravaned upon
wheels and carted out of the jurisdiction of muni-
cipal taxes, or swung from a leviathan crane and
fitted with clockwork to go as a pendulum, or
weighted on to a mammoth balloon and sent
cloud dispersing, or electrified into one huge
magnet and made to gravitate through all
obstructions into the centre of gravity, or
Police Magistrate Pinnock, of Brisbane, is
a dear old soul—a human shrine of chivalry—and
is remembered as exhibiting real pluck in the days
of his “colonial experienoe-ing.” Occasionally he
fights his young battles over again on the bench.
The other day he thus delivered himself of his
pent-up disgust anent a trivial case: “When I
was a boy I turned on any lad who interfered with
me and gave him a thrashing. But boys nowa-
days lay an information and bring other boys who
strike them into Court.”—

THE VERY BEST.
A singie pain is often the first indication, and
the last throe, m one, of a physical climax, and
the climax is death. That St. Jacobs Oil has
again and again wrought its miracles just in the
nick of time, has bridged over the critical
emergency, and has
SAVED MANY LIVES
at the point of death, is fully attested by the
record of many extraordinary cures in which this
fact of saving life is duly set forth.
If to its remarkable virtues in the permanent
cure of chronic cases of Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
Lumbago, Sciatica, after years of endurance,
wherein everything else proved valueless, fortunes
were spent in vain, and crutches and crippled
limbs were the manifestations, is to be added its
supreme sovereignty over pain, even unto death,
it is wholly entitled to the appellation of
THE VERY BEST.
Its specific action is especially adapted with a
curative penetration and soothing effect to arrest
any pain at the acme of its worst influence.
A MOST REMARKABLE CASE
can be cited in proof, which is thoroughly verified.
It is in its main features taken from a leading
Liverpool journal as follows : tf Two. years ago ”
states Mr. William Buchanan, residing at No. 8,
■ John s-road, Kirkdale, Liverpool, and twenty-
four years in the service of the Cunard Steamship
Co., _ I was taken down with a most excruciat-
ing pain in my head, which was followed by
ONE YEAR OF TORTURE.
All physicians believed that it would lead to
softening of the brain and death. Six of the most
eminent attended me ; but gave no relief. I had
to be held down, and my screams were heard out-
side. My case was deemed incurable. My wife
procured a bottle of St. Jacobs Oil, and applied it
to my head. It acted like magic. I was cured
by it, and am now in perfect health, and I have
not had the slightest return since I was cured
some months ago.” Nothing more need be added.

PROGRESS IN CIVILISATION.
Nature never makes a mistake. Whatever
material is at hand is turned to the best use.
Man, the creation of Nature, follows in her foot-
steps, and steadily seeks a higher plane by re-
jecting the less worthy, and selecting that at his
command which is the most practical. This
progress in civilisation is marked in all details of
Ine, and particularly in the different apparatus or
mechanical contrivances for every day con-
tingencies. One by one the less fitting drop out
or are literally crowded aside by those offering
Mipenor advantages. _ Steam has superseded sail.
Ihe old time horological contrivances are pushed
to the rear by the newer, less costly, and more
reliable appliances of to-day. To-day the public
demand economy, combined with quality
honesty, and accuracy, and in all these particulars
the W aterbury watches “fill the bill,” and there-
by have gained respect and admiration in every
quarter of the earth as honest, reliable, and faith-
ful timekeepers, produced at as low a cost as is
compatible with good material, skilful workman-
ship, and their undoubtedly excellent qualifi-
cations.
Owing to a tremendous gust of wind at
Silverton on Oct. 29, the local Wesleyan Church
was completely wrecked. The pub. still proudly
stands. The world spends more in building its
pub. than it does over the erection of its church.
Writes a Bulletin correspondent:—
The greatest drawback to the progress of the Richmond,
is the state of the entrance to the river. The Government
are spending a lot of money, and are getting a poor
return for the outlay at the breakwater and training wall,
where they have about 30 bosses to look after 10 or 12
labourers. But it was ever thus on Government works.
The Lismore-Tweed railway won’t pay 1 per cent, on cost
of construction til] large vessels can enter and leave the
river at any time and in any weather. But the said
railway will be a white elephant anyhow for the next 20
y ears - ft represents the price paid by the people of
N.S.W. to buy the votes of 3 members who were
returned to further the cause of Protection, but who
were bought to vote for Preetrade b}* the granting of the
railway. And at least one of the aforesaid members will
get an unpleasant surprise next election.
At Aldershot, ling., a month or two back,
the body of a man was found with the throat cut.
A woman named Gilbert positively identified the
remains as those of her husband, and as a corro-
borative fact she stated that he had a deformed
finger. The dead man had such a deformity,
two Well-known respectable residents pf Alder-
shot swore to the body being that of Gilbert
whom they had known for niany years, and other
witnesses also believed the body to be that of
Gilbert. A few days ago the supposed dead man
walked into his wife’s house much to that, lady’s
astonishment. _ This strange case has made a
great sensation in the district. And no wonder,
yet the evidence as to the dead man’s identity
was conclusive from a judge-and-jury point of
view.
Dear Bulletin When the late N.S.W.
Poasbmasther-General came up to Monaro last
election the natives had some fun with him,
begorra. Ye see, Daniel had been swimming
several creeks and getting wet to the shkin while
going round the counthry, and the excoited pork
butcher was followed by a mob of about 96
admirers, mostly named Gallagher and Hoolan
a j i u f roone ya and they were all wet too. By-
and-bye they shtopped at a pub kept by a man
named Murphy, and while they were dhrinking
there a man named O’Brien was seen doing some-
thing to the Poastmasther's horse —I was informed
of this afterwards by a man named O’Grady.
Anyhow, after a while a man named Hooligan
helped the Poastmasther on to his horse, and the
procession started, and just five minutes after-
wards the Poastmasther was yelling at the top of
his voice : Whoosh! Woa! Gallagher! Doolan !
Mulrooney ! Shtop, for the love of Heaven, me
horse is upside down.” I ran out to see what the
rbw was about, and some son of a gun had turned
Dan s saddle back to front, and there was a man
named 0 Toole laffing himself to death behind a
haystack. I send this letter along to your office
by a man named O’Connell.—Yours, &c., Patrick

Gilbert Dalziel, proprietor of the inane
and truly English Ally Sloper’s Half Holiday,
recently offered a prize of £lOOO for the best verse
which might be sent in on a certain date. A Mr.
George Hicks— must be related, judging from his
literary quality, to the giant Hicks, erst of Sydney
Punch —won the money with this :
There was an old fossil named Sloper,
Astronomer, sage, horoscoper,
He fell down the stairs
And saw comets in pairs,
That unfortunate, fruity, old Sloper.
Fancy a man getting £lOOO for that! And yet
there* are hundreds of poor, clever devils knocking
about 1 leet-street who would be glad to get half-
a-sovereign a column for really decent verses. This
was no bogus business. Dalziel paid the money
right enough. The literary market is an inscrut-
able institution. Why, a Sydney newspaper-
proprietor can, for one £25-prize, get enough
competitive” stories to run his rag from one
Christmas to another.

Vincent West—his real name was Paul Washington Vin-
cent, and he was a son of the distinguished Chartist
of that name—late manager for the Sheridan Comedy
Company, died from typhoid at the Hobart General
Hospital, on Sunday, November Ist. The deceased, who
was a thoroughly good fellow and a smart business
manager, was only 2C years of age. His loss will be
deeply felt by Johnny Sheridan, after whose departure
for Brisbane West fairly lost heart, and remained in_a
very low condition until his demise. Poor West had, in
Brisbane, a severe attack of brain-fever after his troubles
with the insolvent Wangenheim Co.

It must have been a very painful task, says Tle
Bulletin’s London correspondent, for Clement Scott and
the other Irving-wnrshipping critics to have to write
down the first appearance of their idol’s son as a dead
failure. Fortunately for them, young Hare’s debut, at
the same time, was a distinct success, and this served as
a cloak to the other, for in praising him they were able
to avoid saying much about young Irving’s lame perform-
ance in “ School.” Hare, junior, has undoubtedly a
brilliant theatrical career before him, it he be not spoiled
by undue adulation. There is just a chance that young
Irving may do better in heavier parts, for his style is
ponderous. The w'orst part of the youth is his voice,
which is harsh and unpleasant, and apparently unman-
ageable. I am told that Irving, pere, is much dis-
appointed that his son should have done so poorly. He
himself was playing at the Grand Islington the evening
his son appeared at the Garrick, and his anxiety and
abstraction were quite marked.

Since Dampier has been playing “ Robbery Under
Arms,” about 18 big, stalwart, grey-bearded men have
called on him mysteriouslj', and refused to give their
names at the door, and have taken Alfred aside in a dark
corner, and looked anxiously round to make sure that
nobody was listening, and then secretly breathed into his
ear that they—all of them—were collectively and indivi-
dually the oply original Captain Starlight. Then they
have whispered hoarsely that their safety was now in
Alfred’s keeping, and that he possessed their life’s secret
—lB of them. After that they have softly asked for 18
separate half-crowns and 18 drinks. Dampier is a long-
suffering man, but he declines to stand this any longer,
and the next reformed bushranger who visits him will be
treated coldly. The real, original Captain Starlight is
now in Sydney, and will visit him shortly.
Launceston (Tas.) people lately received a great shook

prominent Launcestonian who has just died was William
Bull, who carried on the old Tam O’Shanter Inn for about
40 years. He could tell many a stiff yarn about hunting

“Square.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Twelvemonths ago I took an opportunity
of studying the Sydney shop-girl in her habitat.
For a dreary period of four or five weeks’ length
my wife and I endured existence in a Surry Hills
boarding-house which also accommodated five
other boarders—girls of the shop and the work-
room.
They were average girls—typical of their class
in manners, in the dress that aped that of women
with money in their purses, in the narrow and
narrowing thoughts—typical, alas ! in the pathetic
colourlessness of their lives, across whose lustre-
less days and nights there shone but one iridescent
gleam a-week—the Sunday harbour-trip with
their “boy.”
* * #
The girls’ custom was to leave the house
in a bunch after an eight o’clock breakfast of tea
and bread-and-butter—boarders at 12s. 6d. weekly
are not permitted to enjoy other than in imagina-
tion a more substantial matutinal meal—and
together they would pass down Albion-street
towards Belmore Park and so to the city. My
wife and I had frequently watched them from our
balcony across the street to the shady path, and
would speculate on the probable duration of their
friendship, for they were not merely fellow-
boarders, but friends. One morning, however,
four only crossed the thoroughfare. The other
went down the'side on which the sun was already
glaring hotly and distressingly—alone.
“They have quarrelled,” said my wife; “and
■depend upon it that one girl is in the wrong. All
the other four would not have turned against her
•otherwise. ”
The fool that is in every married man, and
which prompts him to occasionally demand free-
dom of speech in his wife’s ear, thereby provoking
for himself grievous ignominy and humiliation,
put it into my head to make a remark. “Now, I
should have thought differently. From my know-
ledge of the sex, I should say that when four
women agree to ‘ cut ’ a sister, the latter is in the
right. Women never appreciate a character which
is a reproach to themselves.”
“Tush!” declared the arbitress of my fate.
“You are speaking from an imperfect knowledge
of women. With this class it is different. They
are nearer to Nature’s heart, notwithstanding
their affectations and follies, and their woman-
hood is purer, simpler, and truer than that of
their superior sisters. Mark my words : there is
something seriously wrong with that girl, or the
others would not have broken off with her, as it
is plain they have. ”
I am the least assertive of men and, therefore,
though I held to my opinion, I said no more.
* * *
We—my wife and I—dined with the girls.
'They had their breakfasts by themselves, and
took their lunches with them—those paltry
lunches !—but at the chief meal, the meat-tea,
they sat down with us.
That evening the four entered the dining-room
in a group. The fifth had not then arrived home,
nor did she come in until the meal was well
advanced. Then she entered, and with a defiant
look at the four, who would not meet her gaze,
took her seat in her usual place, which was next
my wife’s.
And now a curious thing happened. The girl,
who had apparently flung resentment at her co-
workers, and had challenged their scorn, drew
away from ray wife—her cheeks flamed furiously
then a bloodless paleness conquered the red
colour. And, whilst on other nights she had
responded not unintelligently to our conversa-
tional overtures, she now was abrupt to the verge
of rudeness in her one-syllabled replies. As for
the four other girls they, too, were shackled by
restraints of manner and speech. It had been at
once an educative experiment and a pleasure to
observe how their minds had been throwing out
suckers and tendrils of intelligence under the
nurturing influence of converse with people who
knew something, more than they did of the world
outside the cheap boarding-house, the public-
school and the shop ; but to-night there was no
lighting-up of the dull, work-wearied eyes, as
some hitherto undreamt of thought swept into
their mental horizon—no eager beaming of the
face in welcome of the visitant. Instead, there was
blankness, silence, the misery of stupidity.
There was no necessity for my wife and I to
exchange one word as to the meaning of this
alteration of demeanour, or for the girls to take
the former into their confidence. For it was
patent, the significance of it all —the severance in
the morn ng, the antagonism of the night. The
flush on the one girl's cheek was the banneret of
newly-born shame.
* * *
We had just returned to our room, when
a timid, tremulous knock touched the panels of
tne door. I opened it. One of the four stood on
the landing—an angle of light through the stair-
opening of the upper floor showing that the doors
of the girls’rooms were ajar, evidently to permit
their occupants to hear the result of the mission.
\\ould 1 mean—oh, it doesn’t matter—”
the girl confusedly murmured:
* Miss V You wish to see me?”
My wife came to the door, and, thrusting me back
asked of the girl her errand.
‘’ If you would—not mind—just a minute-
askin’ your pardon, ma’am ”
“Of course not—come in here !”
I went down to spend a solitary hour in
the sitting-cwm-difiing-room. I had time to
study every lineament of the cheap oleograph
portrait of Parnell which was the sole pictorial
adornment of the apartment; time to speculate
on how the original maker of the shell-covered
money-box (wholesale Sydney price, Bs. per dozen )
that, from the pride of place on the mantel
symbolised jdie undeveloped artistic cravings and
matured moan economies of the landlady, could
keep body and soul together on the profits of the
manufacture; time to yawn over an Evening
News leader, and to doze over a scintillation of
Echo wit; time to do all these things, before I
was recalled to be brought face to face again with
the eternal terror of the “ social \ roblein.”
* # #
All the live girls had, it seemed, passed
into our room at my wife's invitation, but none of
the four would (at first) say a word beyond—“ Ask
her, ma'am.” As for the fifth girl, she would not
speak, because her shame held her dumb, and had
cut, seemingly, her vocal cords. My wife had to
press them more than once fpr a statement of their
business with her :—“lf yog will not tell me, then
I must ask you to go away, for my husband has
writing to do ! ”
Then it was, that the girl spoke, the girl with
the leprous taint.
“Writin’l” The syllables forced themselves
through a half-strangling sob. “ Writfn’! Why
don’t he write an’ tell the people what things go
on in this city ? Why don’t he write an’ tell them
why poor girls like me don’t— can't— keep-
square?” Then, flinging off some of her shame,
she assumed the heart-breaking brazenness of the
utterly-reckless woman. “ Why we can’t keep
square-let him tell them that! An’ those girls
there, my mates that was, let him ask them why I
didn’t keep square—an’, why, sooner or later,
they JI have to go the same way !”
That last remark was as the turning-on of the
waters. Ihe other four, stung with the taunt,
and righteous with the unstinted wrath of the as
yc untempted woman, abandoned reticence for
voluble speech. They could keep straight—and
why could she not ? They could live upon 15s. a
week-and why shouldn’t she ? They could hold
their tongue when the forewomen were “nasty”
f”. > billets, refuse to give back
lip for the insults of petty tyrants—and why
couldntshe? J
.1 rorn the tangle of confused talk and violent re-
crimination, and tears that hurt more than
poisoned words, my wife at last deduced this
much : that the offending girl, who was an
ea Val°J e ’ t x t } le others, of a large drapery and
outfitting firm, had been dismissed for insolence
the previous Saturday, and that, so far from
seeking for other work, she had done, well—what
would a parentless, workless, friendless girl, who
feared hunger and death more than shame, do?
* * *
“ That is why we told her, ma’am, fco-night
as she was a-goin’ out she shouldn’t come in again,
for we d made up our mind to tell the landlady
said one of the four.
“ We've our characters to lose, we ’ave—an’
we re not willin’ to lose’em for her sake, though we
iU u bin mates ! ” cried another.
“We’d be turned out o’ the shop to-morrow”
saul a third—the one who had come to our door.
ihe square girls wouldn’t work with us, an’ the
girls we suspect of not being straight an’ no better
than she is, would vote with the square ones to
prevent us guessin’ they’re up to the same game '
JNo I—she s got to go or else we will! ”
“The shop’ll turn you out, will they?” the
accused laughed hysterically. “An’ yet they all
heard the forewoman—damn her, I say, I never
said a bad word before, but damn her, damn her
Her passion choked her.
V\ hat did the woman say ? ” pressed my wife
appal led at this glimpse into the volcano of the
girl s heart.
The girl who had been first to speak of the four
answered ;• She told her, Nell there, she’d have
to fine her five shillings for bad work, or some-
thing*
“ For badly finishin’ a skirt! ”
\ es, that was it. But, of course, it wasn’t
true—we know that.”
’ Not true,” breathed rhy wife.
“ No-never is true ! The truth was she’d had
a bad week—y know the forewoman of each room
has to turn out so many costumes a-week, or make
so much profit some other way, or else she won’t
get her premium from the bosses.”
“ Premium ? What is that ? ”
“ If she makes so much profit over a certain
sum, she gets a percentage over her salary. So
her object is to cut down expenses, an’ pay the
work-girls less. An’ she can nearly always show
time' ” * nm em ’ or ma kin’ ’em work over-
“ Is this true ? ”
, f m I ri j e • ” exclaimed the girl with the taint—
line . It sas true as Gospel, or as that I ain’t
square no longer. That’s true enough, God
knows!” She turned her head away, and her
light form swayed with the tumult of her sound*
Jess sobs. The four mates looked on her humilia-
tion stonily.
|| And she fined you ? ” , ,
Yes, fined me five-bob 1 I asked her howl
hve on A ten shillings—l was supposed to
get fifteen. An she said, as she laughed, that
wasn t her concern, but she supposed I could do
as the other girls did to make it up ! ”
I heardVt ” ° ne 0ur ’ “ that—
T „, J’ m not the only one she’s said it to, an’
J.JJ not be the last. You’re precious good, yen
are, you four, but she’ll say it to you some day,
and you won t have pluck to answer her as I did!”
What did you say ? ”
ber I would do as she meant, and
that the sin of it, an’ the shame of it, should be on
her an the men, her bosses. I told her that, an’,
of course, I was sacked on the spot! ”
Poor thing, poor girl!” The hand of the
elder woman touched the stricken girl pityingly
but it was jerked aside.

or your three guineas ;to the front-shop, for makin’
your costumes, an’ you never ask how much we
get out of it—you don’t choose to think that the
money we get from—from-from— ‘ friends ’ goes
to pay for your things. Blame yourselves if we
am t square!”
In her tragic arraignment of Fate she erred
somewhat. But, as my wife questioned, “ Was
she far wrong ?” ■ .
* * •

The corpses of Chinese who die in America
are returned to the Flowery Land in mutilated
fragments tinned-up after the fashion of canned
meats. A freight of supposed dead-Chinaman
recently arrived in China from ’Frisco, and was
found by the sorrowing relatives to be a consign-
ment of tinned American-hog and preserved fish
which should have gone to Europe. The infer-
ence is that the canned-Chinee cargo has been
sent by mistake to Europe, and has been con-
sumed unawares by the retail purchasers as some
of America’s export delicacies.

The Governor of Tasmania (Sir Robert

of the smashed-up Bank of Van Diemen’s Land
ought to be searchingly inquired into. So it
ought, but tremendous efforts are made to stifle
inconvenient enquiries.
The S.M. Herald is a strictly “ constitu"
tional ” paper; but its afternoon edition, the
Echo, writes leading articles in favour of lynch
law. Lynch law for a penny ; constitutionalism
for tuppence. By the way, the Echo aforesaid is
conveniently oblivious. The Bulletin doesn’t
object to its scissoring ’Frisco Argonaut whole-
sale and promptly. It only suggests that the Echo
should acknowledge when it steals. Or, perhaps
a less troublesome way, it should label “Echo”
what it doesn't crib.
Rev. Yair, a Scotch parson, now aged 91,
proved himself in his youth a clerical Lochinvar.
The parents of the lady to whom he was attached
were so much against the match, that when the
wedding-morning arrived, they securely locked
their daughter in Her bed-room. Mr. Yair, how-
ever, humbly pleaded that he might at least be
allowed to shake hands with the young lady, and
bid her good-bye. His request was granted, and
the prisoner was brought out. Then the bride-
groom’s chance came, Seizing the girl by the
right hand, he said, “I take you to be my wife.”
The blushing bride, as swiftly replied, “ I take
you to be my husband; ” and the wedding was
complete—according to the Scotch law. Then the
Reverend Joseph carried off his bride, before the
eyes of the dumbfounded parents.
The grim and gruesome French murder is
a standing subject for the moral British paper to
preach about, and the innate brutality of the
French criminal is much howled over. Here, as a
contrast, is a nice, fresh (by last mail) British
murder —a bright and cheerful homicide with a lot
of thrill in it. One of the criminals was eight
years old —he was addicted to going out at night,
and his mother locked him up in the evenings and
confiscated his clothes so as to make him stay in
bed. He got riled at this, and thought it would
be a handy thing to murder another boy and keep
his togs for emergencies. The other small
homicide aged nine—joined in the murder
merely for the sake of amusement. He was a
blase, haggard, dissipated small boy who
wanted some new excitement. They selected
a child of eight years, and beguiled him
to a lonely, unfinished building, and threw him
down 12 feet into a pool of water. Apparently
they had counted on the fall killing him, but as
he wasn’t injured they hauled him up, and having
stripped him naked they threw him in again. The
miserable infant, who was thus being soaked and
concussed to death, still objected, so he was
(hauled out once more. Then the pair concluded
(that a longer drop might do him good, and this
■time they threw him a distance of 16 feet, after
which they climbed down and sat on his head to
ikeep him under water. To make quite sure, in
fact, they sat on his head off and on for about two
(hours after he was dead. Finally they annexed
his clothes and went home. They are both quite
happy over the event.
' O’Loghlen says “ Berry will soon get over
the drawback of his title.” But then Bir Broyne
has one, too—the more sticky “ Bart.”
On Friday evening, 30th October, ' 189],
Sydney Domain was infested with immense hordes
of the most destructive kind of flying termites
(white ants). On a November evening in 1833, -a
similar phenomenon was witnessed. A convict- ,
woman got a ticket-of-leave for running into the
midst of the myriad-thronged insects, and saying
a child upon whose face and body they had settled
in thousands.
Brisbane brewers are now cut-throating
each other in business. Until recently, they had
formed a ring, the rule of which was that they
sold beer to the publicans at <£4 per hogshead. A
split in the syndicate occurred the other day r and
an enterprising firm cut down the price to £2 10s., J
whereupon another firm “went one better” by
distributing its beer at £2 per hogshead—
HE LIGHTS HIS PIPE ONCE MORE. !
Some fifty years ago the English ship “Argos*
was wrecked on a low-lying key or sand island of
the Bahama group. Only one man, a sailor, wap-
thrown safely on the beach by the waves. In his
pocket was a tin tobacco-box, a pipe, and a flint
and steel. Wringing the water from his clothes,
he seated himself, lighted his pipe, and with true
British phlegm proceeded to. consider his situa-
tion. The moral of which is that when an English-
man, having the means, refuses to smoke, he is in
very bad form.
For example, here is a man who says, “I always
enjoyed my pipe, but now I couldn’t take a whiff,-’
To be sure, there was a reason, and he puts it in
this way. “Up to Michaelmas, 1887,” he says;
“ I was a strong, healthy man. About this time
I began to feel bad at my stomach and had no
relish for food. I had a bad taste in the mouth,
and after eating I would retch and vomit until,
the water oozed out of my eyes; and so bad was
this that my wife had to hold my head. My eyes
turned yellow, and I felt low, weak, and nervous.
Sometimes I would break out into a sweat and
then go cold and chilly.
“ I couldn’t touch solid food, and for months I
belched up sour water; and what I did eat lay
heavy upon, and seemed to be dead and lifeless in
my body. Feeling low and depressed, I had ho
enjoyment in company. x .
“ Before this I was always cheerful and enjoyed
my pipe, hut now I couldn’t take a tvh iff.
“I had a craving, gnawing pain at the stomach,
which nothing eased for long together. I had
bran poultices applied, and took different kinds of
medicine, but nothing went to the spot, nothing
eased me. After a time I had to give up my work,
for I got so weak and nervous / couldn’t hit my
work iron, and my tools and th ings flew out of my
hand.
“ For over four months I did not have a single
good night’s rest. I would turn and turn in bed
all nigfht long, and my wife and I often sat up the
best part of the night rather than go to, bed., I
went so thin that my clothes fairly hung upon me!
Friends who came to see me told one another I
could not get better, and even my wife said I
would do no more work in this world.
“ For more than twelve months I had a clever
doctor attending me, but his medicine did me no
good; then I went to see a physician at Sudbury,
with the same result. The doctors sounded my
lungs, but found nothing wrong, and said all my
ailments were brought on by bad digestion.
“ I now got weaker and weaker, and had given
up all hopes of recovery, when in the spring of
1889 a lady from London who was staying at the
vicarage at Otten Belchamp heard of my condi-
tion. She called at Mr. Goody’s, the medicine
dealer, and told him to supply me with some
Mother Siegel’s Curative Syrup and she would
pay for it. Very reluctantly 1 took the medi-
cine, for I had tried so many things without
obtaining any benefit. However, my wife pressed
me so hard that at last I began to take the Syrup.
After a few doses I said to my wife, ‘ I think I
feel better for this medicine,’ and from that time I
commenced to improve. By the time I had taken
three bottles I was back at my work, as strong
and well as ever—much to the surprise of every-
body.
“ People all about said I would never get locll,
hut I did, thank the Lord.
“Now I tell everyone that Mother Seigel’s
Syrup saved my life. I can now eat anything,
and feel so light-hearted I could jump over a five-
barred gate. My neighbours all say I look ten
years younger.”
Elias Bland, shoemaker,
Belchamp St. Paul, Clare, Suffolk.
The doctors who attributed Mr. Bland’s illness
to indigestion and dyspepsia were quite right.
All they lacked w r as the proper remedy. This
appeared in Mother Seigel’s Syrup, and now our
good friend enjoys his pipe as he did in other
years. If he is ever handled in that way again we
may wager he won’t forget what to do.
Here’s luck for some, yet not for such
As swill colonial swank;
For publicans charge just as much

The price is just as stiff ;

whole, is admitted; total abstinence, however, is
not the sole cause; that cause consists of a
generally prudential character of which total ab-
stinence is merely the exhibition in one particular
direction.”

An Anglican bishop vouches for the fact
that, at a recent clerical examination, a candidate
for holy orders wrote that (the regicide) Oliver
Cromwell, on his death-bed, cried : “ If I had

not be thus forsaken in my old age ! ”
N.S.W. Labour-member Rae’s remark
that he had invested in another new shirt so as t°
give the laundresses a turn, reminds us that there
is in Queensland a now rather wealthy lawyer
.whom we only met on two occasions. The first
time he was waiting in bed waiting for his
only shirt, which was being washed by a lady,
locally known as the “Bull-pup.” The second
time he was leading to the altar the daughter of
a mining millionaire.
Hugh Gilmore, the Adelaide Socialist
clergyman, a man of remarkable oratorical and con-
versational powers, died the other day, after suffer-
ing dreadful agony, from internal cancer. Thirty
years ago he was a homeless wandering street
arab in Glasgow, and had it not been for a charit-
able schoolmaster would probably have never lived
to preach the “ national ” gospel. Gilmore’s
advent to South Australia boomed Radicalism in
a remarkable way. He was a Primitive Methodist,
but declined to confine his religion to any creed,
and was ever at the head of any movement
calculated in his opinion to raise the standard of
human happiness. His loss to the S.A. demo-
cratic party is almost irreparable.
J. J. Dodd, Mayor of Scone (N.S.W.),
also District-Secretary to the Pai\toralists’ Union,
when officially “ requested ” to resign either that
position or his J.P.-ship, sweetly “fails to see
how the two positions are incompatible,” and,
“ not being a paid officer under the Government,”
he “ declines to resign either ” honour. This is a
petty matter, anyhow, but the objection sounds
queerly coming from the ranks of those who fought
against unionists being enrolled as special con-
stables, and laughed to scorn the idea of labour-
leaders being appointed to the Commission of the
Peace. It is the same old special claim of special
privilege. The outward and visible signs of law
are only for the pastoralist and the man of Pro-
perty. Packed benches are the prerogatives of
men with “ stakes in the country.”

The Theatre Royal Hotel, Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange, curious
and refreshing drinks known in the United States
can be obtained. Their name is legion, but among
them may be mentioned champagne cocktails,
gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—probably the
noblest liquor known to man—imperial punch,
Manhattan cocktails, and many others. All
mixed by American bar-keeps. James A. Walsh,

A German physician of great insightedness
defines the main dif. in the effects of whisky and
of beer as follows : “ Visky makes you kill some-
body else; mit beer you only kills yourself.” Pass
both of them.
It occurred thus. Mr. and Mrs. Buffles
put up for the night at a Charters Towers (N.Q.)
hotel. Buffles was badly attacked in the night
with spasms, and Mrs. B. rushed out for a doctor,
but rouse one up. Then she remembered
some-mustard-leaves she had in a hand-bag in the
sitting-room. She procured one and returned
up-stairs. To her astonishment, Buffles was
placidly asleep. But she wasn’t going to be
fooled out of her trouble, so she gently applied
the mustard-leaf where it ought to do most good,
and sat down by the bedside to await results. She
didn’t have to wait long. Buffles moved uneasily
once or twice, and then sat up with a yell that
made Mrs. Buffles’ blood freeze. Piercingly she
screamed, and Charters Towers became alive with
snowy robes of night and jack-o’-lanterns. Among
the foremost to enter the apartment was—horror !
Buffles in his pyjamas! Buffles with—“By the
great platterpuss of the Hockingjock Ranges!
Give me gore and a sponge. My wife in a strange
man’s bedroom ! Oh, my connubial felicity !
Come on, 'everybody, and see me die, martyred
by a woman’s frailty.” Mrs. Buffles had mistaken
the bedroom and plastered the wrong man’s
diaphragm. It took fourteen affidavits and a
jug of whisky to convince Buffles of his wife’s
innocence.
Extract from an offi ;ial despatch by James
Russell Lowell; —
One of the dev ices of Fourcarde which came within M.
Silvelo’s own knowledge when in another department of
the Government is so ingenious and amusing as to be
worth recounting. The Frenchman’s object was to
smuggle petroleum into Madrid without paying the
octroi. To this end he established storehouses in the
suburbs, and then, hiring all the leanest and least mam-
malian women that could be found, he made good all
their physical defects with tin cases filled with petroleum,
thus giving them what Dr. Johnson would have called the
pectoral proportions of Juno. Doubtless he blasphemed
the unwise parsimony of Nature in denying to women in
general the multitudinous breasts displayed by certain
Hindoo idols. For some time these seemingly milky
mothers passed without question into the unsuspecting
city, and supplied thousands of households with that
cheap enlightenment which cynics say is worse than none.
Meanwhile, M. Fourcarde’s pockets swelled in exact
proportion to the Quaker breastworks of the improvised
wet-nurses. - Could he only have been moderate ! Could
he only have bethought him in time of the ne quid nimis !
But one fatal day he sent in a damsel whose contours
aroused in one of the guardians at the gates the same
emotions as those of Maritornes in the bosom of the
carrier. With the playful gallantry of a superior he
tapped the object of his admiration, and it tinkled. He
had “struck oil” unawares. Love shook his wings and
fled. Duty retired frowning, and M. Fourcarde’s peram-
bulating wells suddenly went dry.
Dear Bulletin, —I noticed a paragraph in
The Australasian of October 10, re a paper read
before the geographical section of the British
Association by a Miss Clarke, She cited the
“Spanish Benedictine Monastery at New Norcia,
80 miles from Perth, W. A., as the most striking
refutation of the generally received belief in the
irredeemable degradation of the Australian abo-
rigines.” In the early part of this year I passed
through New Norcia with a mob of horses, and
took special notice of the educated black. In
common with most Queenslanders I believed that
once a nigger knows too much he ceases to be
useful to himself or anybody else, and what I saw
there only tended to strengthen that opinion.
They (the nigs.) are put up in cottages, each of
which has what has been intended for a garden in
front, and when any of the monks are about their
behaviour is good, even pious ; but let the good
monk turn his back and King Tarpot is once more
himself —can rip round, and swear generally, and
conduct himself as a blackfellow should. The
gins are the same as in other parts of Australia,
for, though correctly churched and living in an
outwardly respectable manner with their black
husbands in suburban villas, none of them are
virtuous to the verge of eccentricity. New Norcia
is a novel sight to a native-born Australian. The
buildings are half Australian and half Moorish in
style. The monks, who wear long beards, are
clothed in sombre gowns, and have a most
gruesome appearance. The sight of them
made a Murchison River black I had with
me turn almost pale. Each monk has a dif-
ferent trade, and they can turn out anything,
from a linoh-pin to a landau. But the chapel is
the centre of attraction ; at the most inopportune
times a deep-sounding bell booms, and they all
cease work and make tracks for the sacred edifice,
presumably for prayer. The nigs, don’t join in
these promiscuous devotions, no doubt reserving
themselves for a good blow-out on Sunday. The
Benedictines are past-masters in the game of land-
grab, for they have secured a good-sized run, the
outside blocks of which are fenced at each corner,
ready for a continuation should any democratic
Government imagine it open for selection.
In this they have been aided by a large store-
keeper, who held a position under the old regime.
They bought his goods, and he obtained their
freeholds. They receive from a maternal Govern-
ment £15 for every nigger they bring into the
fold, and certainly knock a little work out of
them. The nigger rides your buckjumper, the
monk takes the money. Where the profits of this
self-supporting and no-wage establishment go is
not known, but no doubt the terrible Infanta of
Spain or some other superfluous person draws a
div. New Norcia is the first civilised part that
Ernest Giles struck after one of his exploring
trips. The few settlers round about greatly
admire this vast Ultra-conservative monkery, but
where white people won’t trouble about obtaining
a vote, call the boss “the master,” scrub “a
thicket,” and a paddock a “field,” they are only
in the polyp stage of existence, and one can afford
to look on them with feelings of pity and sym-
pathy. The monks drive as hard a bargain as any
Jew, but, to their credit be it said, no man
travelling per boot knocks at the door in vain for
a feed.—Yours, Dan. Turnback, Snowy River,
21st Oct., ’91.
“Nursing is one of the deadliest occupa-
tions known to women. More than half the-
deaths of Catholic nurses in 38 German hospitals',
were due to tuberculosis. A healthy girl of
seventeen devoting herself to hospital-nursing dies-
on an average twenty-one and a half years sooner
than a girl of the same age in the general popula-
tion. A woman of twenty-four will live twenty-
two years longer in the outside population than
what she would do if she were a nurse in a
hospital.”
A good many years ago, when Editor
MTlwraith first settled in Rockhampton (Q.) and
started to run the Morning Bulletin in that
region, he had an interesting experience with the
local hospital. There was an old-established feud
of some kind between the paper and tiro hospital,
and, therefore, all the advertising went to
MTlwraith's loathsome contemporary across the
street. When the new proprietary had settled
down, however, and got a firm hold of things, its
gentlemanly representative waited on the hospital
authorities, and suggested that the hatchet might
be buried with advantage; but iie was received
with such unnecessary contumely that he went
back and reported the circumstance to his em-
ployer. That astute old man was writing
a leader on the dairying industry or some-
thing, but he stopped and listened, and smiled
a heavenly smile inside his long white beard.
“Bide a wee, mon, till wo get into the new
oaffice,” he said, placidly, and the canvasser
“bided” accordingly. They got into the new
office, and then ho called again, and was received
in a more hostile manner even than before. He
came back and reported once more. “ It’s all
right, mon,’’said the MTlwraith, gently ; “bide
a wee longer till we get settled down in the new
oaffice.” It took him about thre*e months to settle
down to his own satisfaction. Then one day he
sent along a letter, pointing out that, according
to the statute, all advertisements were to b e
inserted in the nearest newspaper, and en-
closing a surveyor’s certificate, which testified
that since MTlwraith had got into the new
oaffice, his paper was just two feet nine inches
nearer than the other one. He also appended
a memo about the tines due for three months
continuous disregard of the statute; and when
the hospital committee saw the total, it gave a
yell and fled tumultuously. Next day the adver-
tising business was shifted to MTlwraith’s oaffice,
and the old man kindly said nothing more about
the fines. But the committee has treated him
with great respect ever since.
Johnnie Livingston, a well-known
celebrity, who .lives chiefly on grievances, peti-
tioned the Tasmanian Parliament lately for
redress against a wily old lawyer, who, (Johnnie
says) sold him seme land one week, and re-sold it
to another Johjmie a fortnight after. Bub this
took place forty years ago ! and as everybody who
knows anything; about it is dead and buried, the
House declined to call witnesses.
“Did you ever see a lame Chinaman?”
asks a Charters Towers paper, and proceeds to
give the reason why you never did. Because,
when a Chinaman gets badly hurt and loses a
limb, his mates kill him. ’Chat is a part of their
religion, it is added. If so, The Bulletin
considers that that part of the Chinese religion
should, become, statutorily established, that
rewards should be offered for maiming Chinamen,
and that State-school children should be en-
couraged to study Chinese anatomy. A Pigtail
Day might be added to the list of holidays as a
healthy set-off against Arbor Day ; it might be
; styled Barber Day. ‘ 4 1 know a Chinaman,” said a
Winton (Q.) man, recently, “ who got hurt while
; ilasting rock on a railway-works. His left hand
vas blown off and his right was left. A doctor
amputated the arm and fixed him up. Wo missed
,he Chinaman a few days later, and in answer to
■ inquiry, his friends said that he was dead.
Died of the. wound, eh?’ ‘No; dlinkee tea,
.allee same something in it —dlinkee, killee him.’ ”
Once more, did you ever see a lame Chinaman ?
Pastor Fitchott, late of Melbourne D.T.
{and —ahem ! —the Wesleyan Young Ladies’Col-
lege). is trying to make out in the Pall Mall
Gazette that there is no nationalistic feeling in
Australia, and that the people’s sentiment is
even more imperialistic than public opinion in
Great Britain itself. He is “confident that in the
event of the Empire being threatened with disaster
the colonies would leap to the side of the mothe r
land, and stand ready to pour out their blood and
treasure in its cause.'’ M’yes! The Bulletin,
which lie unsparingly abuses, evidently stinks in
Fitchett’s nostrils, and he asserts that the “great
weeklies” —names, please—of Australia “taken
together, have 500 readers where The Bulletin
has one.” Fitohett, who is a clever writer (for a
parson), needn’t descend to barefaced lies to bolster
up his craze. His conscious mendacities, could
he confine their circulation to England, might be
accepted, but when read in Australia, they only
expose him to derision.
A Melbourne medical student has just

“ Tlib World’s Fair” pops up now as a

Admiral Paris, Director of the Marine
Museum at the Louvre, in a recent interview,
mentioned that in 1831. when he belonged to the
expedition sent in search of La Perouse, they
arrived off the coast of Australia, dying the white
flag of France powdered witli fleur-de-lis, and it
was only in Sydney harbour that they learned the
news of the fall of Charles X. and the revolution,
a year after the event.
