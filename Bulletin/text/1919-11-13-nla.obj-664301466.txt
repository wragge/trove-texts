The Red Page
Literary Dublin
The war has led most men, particularly
those of Irish blood, to discover their real
interests and their nationality. When I last
saw Darrell Figgis it was in a little cafe
off Fleet-street, in idle days before the war,
and I remember that Ralph Hodgson had
been dug out of his office to make a four at
tea. Hodgson was then editing Fry’s Maga-
zine, and his little books were just becom-
ing familiar to people who watch for good
poetry, but he was generally occupied with
making people believe that his chief con-
cern was with horses or cricket. I recall
him saying that when he heard some men
talking about poetry he wanted to go out
and play billiards.
Figgis was - different. At that time he
would have talked poetry any night till the
sun rose. It was all the more strange to
find him immersed in politics here in Dub-
lin, his face bleached by the damp air of a
dozen different gaols, his chin covered by a
reddish, agricultural beard, and his speech
made round and florid by continual use on
public platforms. When I commented on the
change and reminded him of other days and
interests, lie smiled with aggressive good
humor. “Well, what can you expect?” he
said. “I’m swallowed up in politics, but- so are
all the other men. V\ hat Irishman can be
anything else these days? I’d sooner be
writing plays and poems and stories, but
when your hands are tied you have to occupy
yourself first in getting free?”
Most literary men in Dublin have the
same tale. On Sunday night there is a
debate in the Abbey Theatre between Sir
Horace Plunkett and a Sinn Feiner, and
presiding over it is Lennox Robinson, his
long legs twisted like two pieces of mistletoe
under the table and his small-featured face
wrapped in gloom. It is purely political
gloom, for his- play on Parnell has been an
outstanding success in London and looks like
taking America by storm as well. Then
there is “A.E.” hammering out weekby week
an agricultural policy for Ireland; and
Yeats, who has allowed his name to be linked
with Plunkett’s .in a new political review,
The Irish Statesman.
But no! Yeats cannot be classed with
those who are giving their best to politics.
I think it is chiefly his prestige lie has given
to the review, and meanwhile he has retired
to the solitude of a castle somewhere in the
south of Ireland and is engaged on an
abstruse metaphysical work, showing by
figures and diagrams the different stages of
consciousness that various modern writers
have reached. At least, it would be abstruse
if Yeats knew anything about mathe-
matics, but he is said to find it hard to
differentiate between a square and a cone!
“And then there’s Ezra Pound,” says a
friend of his. “Yeats never could resist the
influence of a highly-concentrated person-
ality. Where Tagore wouldn’t affect him,
Pound would carry him off his feet. Just
now he’s affected by Pound’s theory of poetic
realism, and he’ll be going through his verses
chiselling out the beautiful words and put-
ting hard, ugly ones in their places.”
Dublin is an intimate city where men
meet easily and know all about each other’s
work. Time is of less consequence than talk,
and talk is as much an art as putting words
down oh paper or committing pictures to
canvas. In any suburban train you will
find some chance topic of conversation tossed
to and fro among the passengers with a
humorous enjoyment in the game of keeping
it in the air and decorating it with wit mean-
while. It is not for the mere business of feed-
ing and clothing themselves officially that
the Dubliners live: they have too vivid a
sense of the real meaning of life for that.
It is at “A.E.’s” house at Rathmines on a
Sunday night that talk is at its highest
level, though. “A.E.” has the faculty of
gathering men about him and of getting the
best out of them. No one has quite dis-
covered the secret of his personality, though
George Moore has tried to do it in three
delightful books, What escapes Moore is his
humor and urbanity, and his —but it is no
use ferreting around for words and phi’ases
that the author of “Salve” could not find
in his diligent search. There has been no
man who has ever met “A.E.” without being
influenced in some way, whether in his philo-
sophy, his art or his politics.
If the walls that are covered with “A.E.’s”
canvases had the power of speech they could
unfold most of the real life of Ireland as it
has developed during the last 20 years.
Political and artistic and economic move-
ments have all come to birth here, since the
days when “A.E.” first cycled through Kerry,
preaching the benefits of co-operation to
farmers, and Synge wandered in from Mayo
with his precious collection of Irish phrases.
But it is in his art that “A.E.” finds most
pleasure nowadays.
“This is my morning’s work,” he says
bringing out a half-finished portrait of
James Stephens. “It’s like him about the
upper part of the face, don’t you think?”
I am obliged to admit that I do not know
Stephens: that I have never even seen a
photograph of him.
“But you should meet him.” says “A.E.”
quickly. “He’s the most delightful talker
in Ireland, and he’ll be back from the coun-
try in a day or two.”
A little later he is looking for some sketches
that Yeats did in his early days when they
studied drawing together.
“Yeats’s father wanted him to be an artist,”
he explained. “I wanted him to be one, too,
in those days, but he was wrapped up in
poetry. Once when we were in the country
together I really did persuade him to do a
pastel of a bright - bit of landscape with
the sun at noon and the earth glowing with
color. But Yeats could never- quite sur-
render to his subject. When the picture
was finished the sun had gone and there
was a'pale wisp of a moon in the sky.”
His eyes twinkle with a smile that has
no malice in it. There was never a man
who exorcised malice so completely from his
nature, and perhaps that is the reason why
nobody can find an 511 word to say about
him. At midnight, when the circle has grown
very small and “A.E.” has satisfied a curio-
sity about Fritz Hart, who is setting some
songs of liis to music, the talk flows easily
from art and literature to politics and agri-
culture. This is the time you realise that
the poet of “The Earth-Breath,” the mystic
of “The Candle of Vision,” the painter of
Donegal landscapes, is also the editor of
the Irish Homestead. He is ready to prove
with statistics that the pressing need of
Ireland is bulls of a dairying strain to im-
prove the milk-yield of its herds.
And, strange as it may seem, it does not
sound odd to find a poet talking economics
in Ireland, or a working-class leader who
has some knowledge of painting and poetry.
Even the politicians.... But there are no
politicians in this distressful country nowa-
days. I wonder if my fellow-traveller the
English engineer was right when he said
that there was no future before Ireland be-
cause it ( hose for its leaders poets and pro-
phets and professors from the Universities?
Or whether it would be better for it to trust
to the sharp sense of life possessed by
lawyers and stockbrokers and all those
tribes of men who have, in the past, led
humanity upward and onward?
VANCE PALMER.
Rhythm— and the Futility of
Words
Life., after all, is made up of music and
mathematics. Everything-' comes down in
the end to a note of music or a sum. If it
is a discordant note or a maze of errors, the ,
fault is in the individual. Music and mathe-
matics stand supreme. And born of these
immortal parents, with a definite place be-
tween, is rhythm. There have been cleyer
men on this earth who thought they origin-
ated rhythm. The most they could do was
to recognise it and define it. For rhythm
is a cosmic matter. The whole universe
throbs to it; life and growth on this planet
go on to the impulse of a rhythm, which,
though it may change its beat, never stops.
Almost every poet has referred to the sing-
ing spaces and stars, because he feels like
that himself. But if poet’s were told that
writing poetry was like doing sums many of
them would be indignant.
Listen to a class of children saying its
multiplication table! Their sum becomes a
song:—
Twice one are two,
Twice two are four....
When the class gets to double syllables
and figures, the rhythm quickens:—
Twice eleven arc twenty-tw0....
The laws of music and mathematics are
collaborating to make the child remember,
and rhythm is the link between them.
Throughout the theories and practices of
mathematics, this collaboration goes on.
Equations and the several progressions are
examples of rhythmic mathematics. Two
noteworthy facts that are often overlooked
-because of our familiarity with these laws is
that a sum correctly done has the same
answer whether the problem is solved in
the dark, under the sea, on a mountain-top or
in a balloon; also, that a bar of flawless
metal will give out a true note whether it
is struck by a negro or an albino, in Ethiopia
or Labrador. Rhythm is, likewise, univer-
sal. Only to the words —and figures are
words, illustrated by symbols, like Chinese
characters —can humanity lay any claim to
authorship. Aiid even in the matter of words
divine origin lias been claimed.
Yet how futile words are! How little
scope do they give for the free use of har-
monious lines and rhymes, for the realising
of marvellous mathematical dreams!
The poet’s business is to reconcile rhythm
and words. He feels the rhythm, and must
find the words to tell about it to others.
When Kipling spoke of McAndrew’s engines
as -
Singing like the mbrning stars for-joy that they
were made,
he spoke truth. It was no figure of speech,
for their rhythm was of the universe. It
is the fact that the expression suggests life,
analogous to human life, which makes the
simile seem extravagant. For only human be-
ings have put into words anything of the
vast harmonies of music and wonderful
mathematical poems with which the universe
teems. To most men and women the rhythm
that throbs through them and links them
with the stars is something to be expressed.
Sounds and movement, drawings and sculp-
ture, are their mediums of expression. The
trouble is that there are more sounds than
there are fitting and beautiful words to de-
scribe them in. The musician, the artist and
the dancer are better off in this matter than
the poet, for they express in allegories and
by suggestion, and are untrammelled by the
diversities of language. A fiddle is a fiddle
in every land, a picture or statue tells its
own story without words, and a dancer nheds
no interpreters. But the writer is limited
in his work by the language. One of the
notable attempts to break through these
limitations was made by Lewis Carroll in
some of his verses in “Alice in Wonderland.”
This one, for instance: —
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves.
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogroves,
And the mome raths outgrahe.
Simply brillig, the hare, gambolling in the
clearing, when the shadows in the bush were
dim and the moon shining. Even if the mean-
ing is not clear, the words are expressive.
Yet this sort of thing might lead to ridi-
cule. In published serious verse, the word
“gloomser” has been used to mean “wowser.”
If carried to a logical conclusion, which is
an awful thing to happen to any word,
“trousers” would be represented by “bloom-
sers,” and ridicule would follow like a crowd
of larrikins around a funny man.
Words, are undoubtedly the weak tool in
the workman’s bag. at any rate in English.
In the Celtic there seems to be more “sway”;
perhaps it is because in their dreams the
Celts live nearer to the stars. Australians,
being Celtic as well as Australian, may some
day capture a star and learn its secret.

COMIiUNITy, PLATE
j3Gql io < '3cseautij
The distinction of Community Plate, that makes it stand out
in comparison as the highest grade silver-plated cutlery, lies in
its unequalled standards of value, and its popularity among
cultured and discriminating women. After the classical deco-
rative creations of the old masters of art, the designs are Adam
Sheraton, Hepplewhite and Patrician, which give a romantic-
ally historic air to the surroundings.
One need entertain no fear either, when buying a pattern in
Community Plate of seeing the same design made up in a
lighter and inferior article. There is positively no duplication
of designs in Community Plate.
Furthermore, the points o£ greatest wear are protected by an
additional overlay of pure silver at the base of the bowl of
every spoon and fork, ensuring lifelong service, for Com-
munity Plate is guaranteed for fifty years. Complete services
range from £5 to £5O. On sale at the leading shops.

To a Garden.
You gleam and glow about me, lit with bloom
And splendid beauty, gracious with perfume
And warm sun-smiles; your tender glooms of
shade
Like soothing fingers on Day’s forehead laid.
How kind you seem as here you dream apart,
Communing with the loves of your own heart,
With ample sweetness in your glowing breast
To lure a bee to sup, a heart to rest!
In gold and blue your borders break in light
To cater to a brown bee’s appetite;
While new leaves on your every laurel sway,
Enrapturing a blue wren’s wedding-day.
And me, O largesse-giver, make your care,
Kissing me through the fragrance of your
hair!
Drone me gold songs of languid love and
rest,
And suckle me on beauty at your breast!

The Eyes.
■ Those poignant eyes! I know not when they
came
First to appal my dreams, my waking
thought;
But they were ever with me, and I sought,
Vainly and long to give their trouble name.
I thought I knew them, but I could not trace
Their likeness in the store-house of my
mind,
And, wearied of t'heir haunting, failed to
find
Them looking darkly from some stranger’s
face.
Beneath the white lids’ horrified amaze,
Haggard they shone, and dry, for not one
tea.*
Blurred the stark anguish of the deadly
fear
That cowed the wild entreaty of their gaze.
* * * *
I do not know how I crept from the room,
And from the little doctor and his calm
And courteous anodyne of phrase-worn
balm
Wherewith he strove to shroud my spoken
doom.
I went to the tall mirror and surveyed
The body I had loved, that now soon must
Moulder unlovely in the parent dust,
And hated it, for I had grown afraid
Of the decadence its slim beauty veiled,
And fiercely longed for Death to set me
free
From the slow blight, the hopeless agony,
Its clinging to my company entailed.
The firelight barred my braided hair with
gold,
Then on my shadowed face it paused to
shine ;
I saw, at last, those poignant eyes were
mine.
And swayed in floods of darkness, icy cold.

Over the Sea.
A little wind came laughing through the
trees,
That all day long had stood in gracious ease.
Thinking long thoughts, or whisp’ring each
to each
Some secret word of theirs the white stars
teach.
The rustling leaves smiled as the wind went
by. .
And then it reached my window in a sigh.
All sweet with joy, yet plaintive as the
night
When clouds across the moon's face steal her
light.
The leaves grew still, the droop’d boughs
leant to hear
What word the laughing wind brought softly
near.
Then, pure and fragrant, stole your kiss to
me
Across the lapping of the far-off sea!

What Then?
If bright and sure achievement
Were ours from year to year.
And death and death’s bereavement
Brought never sigh nor tear,
And trees were ever sappy,
And flowers were ever rife,
Would we be always happy
And satisfied with life?
If peace was ours for ever,
And noon for ever shone,
And life,- a shining river,
Ran singing on and on ;
If, fearing no to-morrows,
We laughed and sang, like men -
Who drown in wine their sorrows,
Would we be happy then?
If care and evil weather
Brought no despairful mood,
And all men drew together
In one wide brotherhood ;
If, sick of chains that bind us
And toil and dire distress,
We put old wrongs behind us,
Would all be happiness?
Who knows not grief and sighing
True joy can never know;
And if there were no dying,
How weary life must grow!
T' 3 are a tender leaven,
A rain on parching hills
That some vast, kindly Heaven
Out of its bounty spills.

THE HUN COMES BACK.
“There must be no next war and no preparation for
a next war....We must fight determinedly against
any preparation for a next war If we believe
that there is going to be another war and go on
making preparations for it, there will most assuredly
be another war.” — Recent utterance by Australian
politician of no importance but useful as a sample.
A favorite practice with a certain foolish or
traitorous class of politicians is to heave a
long sigh of relief, and £ay that, the war
being ended and the era of peace really
begun, the hatchet may be buried. Nothing
is to be gained, they allege, by preserving old
animosities. A quantity of scoundrels and
Iscariots who toiled (for hire or out. of
perversity) in the Hun interest, and advo-
cated surrender, desertion and repudiation
in the dark days, are now at large and shame-
lessly arrogant and patronising, and they
flaunt themselves in the sight of Heaven as
the only genuine patriots : but it is claimed
that all thjs doesn’t matter, for permanent
tranquillity has set in and they can do no
barai. They can’t try to sell their country
again for want of anyone to sell to, or to
desert again for lack of anybody to desert
to. The race between two old sets of poli-
ticians to outbid each other in buying the
votes of the returned army with loans
charged against posterity is held to be of
little importance, for such an event can only
happen'once and once isn’t often. It is pre-
sumed to be the first and last big Australian
army which will ever return from war, which
may be more true than it looks. The next
army may never return, or, if we are un-
ready, the next war may be fought among
the ruius of our own cities, so that the army
won’t have gone away. The proposition is
even advanced that, war being extinct, it
isn’t worth while to maintain a defence force
of any sort—not even one big enough "to pre-
vent the One Big Union or any other set of
Private Enterprise adventurers “taking
over” the country and plundering it at will.
In all manner of quarters there is the heav-
ing of the long sigh of relief —not the one
that Britain and Europe hove in 1815 or
1850 or 1871, but a duplicate
* * * #
The Hun will come back, or some other
Hun will come instead. Possibly the old
Hun will return accompanied by a fresh
Hun. There is no fixed date for the event.
The scoundrels who tried to betray Australia
to the enemies of civilisation and humanity
in 1916 and 1917 may have a chance to really
sell it in 1921 —or it may be later. The men
who jeer at all sorts of defence in 1919 are
just this much worse liars than they were
in 1913 —that events in the interim have
proved them to be liars. Taking the Prus-
sian Hun as a sample enemy, the war leaves
the German republic the greatest State on
the continent of Europe. Russia had a
shadowy pretence of supremacy, but the pre-
tence has burst. The German Republic has
more people than France and more than the
British Isles. It has almost as much terri-
tory as France, and German Austria will join
some day. Its land hasn’t been ravaged and
its mines and factories destroyed like those
of Belgium, Poland, Serbia .and Northern
France and Italy, so it is ready to resume
work earlier than any of them. Its civil
population has suffered nothing save the
common tribulation of hunger, while those
of the occupied regions have been maimed,
tortured, broken in spirit and bowed down by
slavery, and many of the women have been
demoralised and physically ruined by being
compelled to follow Raixab’s profession in
the Hun camps. Degeneration has been
forced on these peoples, and lor a time their
fighting quality has diminished. The Hun
has certainly lost his colonies, but they sup-
plied him with neither revenue nor troops.
He has lost some territory in Europe, but
it was all unfriendly territory. In other
words, the Hun has thrown his Irelands
overboard, while Britain hasn’t. Save for a
scrap less than a quarter the size of Tas-
mania which is recovered by France, none
of the cessions goes to strengthen any big and
dangerous-looking State. Germany has cer-
tainly lost a great quantity of shipping, but
it has probably lost a smaller proportion of
its own race than either France or Britain.
Even when it pays the indemnity, and even
after France collects its share, it is unlikely
that its bill per inhabitant will be more than
that of France. And it won’t pay much in-
demnity if the chapter of accidents behaves as
the chapter usually does, and if it can dis-
organise its enemies by setting one against
the other, by promoting internal disorders
over Irish or other questions, and by financ-
ing Bolsheviks and One Big Unions. Ger-
many will be helped amazingly by the com
pulsory redxxction —for a time —of its mili-
tary and naval charges, and the release of a
vast number of men for the purposes of in-
dustry, yet for a time at least it is in little
danger of aggression. No one dares to dam-
age the common debtor and spoil his capacity
to pay. The country, too, has apparently
escaped the worst kind of revolution and
settled down to rebuilding its power. Suc-
cessful Prussia made a fresh start in 1815
as the fourth Power on the European con-
tinent, ranking after Russia. Austria and
even defeated France, and it did great things.
Defeated Prussia resumes business in 1919
as the fii-st continental Power, though suffer-
ing under temporary disabilities.
The Hun is only quoted as an example.
He may not come back for a while, though
that sort of thing is a habit with him, but
there is always someone. England in days
wheix there was no empire and no Australia
fought for its life against Spain, and when
it missed destruction by the narrowest mar-
gin it heaved a sigh of relief as big as an
anchor, and felt that an endless vista of
peace stretched ahead. Promptly the com-
petition of France became felt, and before
it was over the war was carried into the
United Kingdom itself. The sigh of fat satis-
faction that was uttered when that question
was settled disturbs the atmosphere yet. and
eternal peace made a fresh beginning. Then
Prussia arose out of nowhere just as Spain
had done. The rising of unexpected enemies
out of nowhere is very disturbing even to
armed and rather aggressive nations like
Britain. To pi-actically unarmed ones like
Poland and the little States that Prussia ate
up in 1866 it is utter disaster. This much
is certain about the present position. In
January, 1914, the British Empire, when it
reckoned up its merchant ships, its navy, its
undoubted cash supremacy and its military
possibilities, had reason to think itself the
greatest Power on earth, and it was backed
by two potent and reliable European friends.
In January, 1920, it knows tliat it is at
best the second Power, while oue of its potent
friends is dead and the other crippled. It
hasn’t acquired any new reliable white popu-
lation to strengthen it. though it has gained
many niggers. The United States has lost
little in the war, and has gained the first
place among the Powers, a mortgage on the
planet and the war habit. Japan has lost
little, but it has gained much, including
money, experience and the removal of its
great rival in Asia, and it is about six times
as big as it was because its possible enemies
are so much smaller through loss, weariness
and wreckage. Neither these nor various
other nations have promised to disarm —they
have only promised to disarm the common
enemy, in fact, some of them ai*e arming at
a great rate. And the reason why somebody
should want to go on a campaign of conquest
and expansion is perhaps four times as-great
among white men and possibly twice as great
among brown men as it was a century ago
because there are at least four times as many
whites and many more browns crowded on
a non-elastic earth. This is bad for the
thinly-peopled countries, and tneir danger
grows automatically. Finally, the unexpected
has an unpleasant habit of happening, and
the fact that so many nations are in hospital
is a special temptation to the more sound
ones to overhaul the patients’ effects.
* * * *
So there is no logic in the hasty burial of
war remembrances, or in the theory that
pacifists, anti-defence ci'anks, International-
ists, Ryanites, pro-Huns, semi-traitors, com-
plete traitors and persons with names like
Schnufflebosch are as good legislators as
any, since eternal peace having begun, they
can do no harm. Eternal peace never began
yet. There is no logic, either, in the reckless
shovelling out of war loans, of which there
seems no end, on the plea that this is Aus-
tralia’s last war debt. All we know is that
it is the first one. The abolition of national
armaments, even if anybody looked like
abolishing them, wouldn’t be the end of
militarism and foreign war, though it might
be the beginning of tyranny, anarchy or civil
war. Militarism never ends, nor does mili-
tant industrialism. When the Government
forces, representing all the people in a self-
governing community, are non-existent or
inefficient, military authority vests itself in
the armed or partially-armed forces of some
of the people—the One Big Union or the boss
brigand or the push. Sometimes ten boss bri-
gands fight p or supremacy and trample down
the community in their private quarrels.
Any sort of plain-clothes or nude force is an
army—is the army, in fact —if thei*e is no
better one about. It doesn’t even require
to be very numerous or to have a very defin-
ite object. Assuming the absence of any sort
of militarism, the meat strikers of Alligator
Creek were not only capable, with their
organisation, of taking Townsville ; they were
the nucleus of a movement which might
have taken Australia and covered it with
butchers and rioters. The lack of militar-
ism, as it is popularly called, never even pre-
vented invasion. The less chaotic of two
mobs will win as effectively as the better of'
two armies. Most of the really virulent
apostles of complete disarmament have some
sort of organisation behind them which is
ready to “take over” the control of things with
a high and brutal hand if the people’s forces
can be got out of the way in the blessed flame
of freedom. And in addition to those who
want to be tyrants themselves there are those
who are paid to sell countries to foreign
tyrants. All these people unite on the plea
that, because the Empire was so unready in
1014 that we only escaped slavery by a
miracle, therefore this part of it should be
more unready next time.
PROSPECTUS OF THE RYAN BRASS-
MINING CO., NO LIABILITY.
The Federal Labor programme of Ryan,
Tudor and Co. (though Tudor seems super-
fluous) is a monumental document. Its
promises are unbounded in the way of doing
some things that cost money (perhaps
£250,000,000 a year would suffice to begin
with), and of coolly doing other things which
might stagger archangels and drive apostles,
prophets and philosophers to despair. It
doesn’t read at all like the story of the
‘crowd of very ordinary hacks whose record
is written in the Norton Griffiths loan
agreement; in the gi*eat, sordid, smellful bor-
rowing boom ; in the Queensland record rail-
way deficit; in the appointment of a vast
herd of officials and a tinsel Excellency in
the Northern Territory to turn that place
into chaos and ridiculej in Australia House,
with its horde of parasites and flunkeys; in
the vaunted new Labor daily for which
money was raised five yeai - s ago, yet which
never begins, possibly because there is no
one with sufficient brains to start it; and
in a mass of public entei*prises the losses
and muddle of which drive three Auditors-
General to despair. Rather it suggests the
programme of some condescending gods
freshly dropped from Heaven to put things
right for poor, erring, cloddish mortals. In
the lordly bestowal of favors Maiiomet,
handing out slices of Paradise, never
promised so much, and John wasn’t half so
excited on Patmos. With it all there is an
absolute lack of detail as to how things are
to be done; and as Director Ryan is hardly
the man to look more stupid than he can
help, the inference is that he and his coad-
jutors don’t know. Certainly no statesman
recorded in history ever did half as much as
they pi’omise with the means at their dis-
posal, these being chiefly paper money of no
value outside the country and stupendous
debts.
* * * *
Some of the pi-omises made are as follows:
To pay a bigger gratuity to soldiers, sailors, etc.,
than Hughes promised (he promised about
£25,000,000), but how much bigger isn’t stated.
To pay in cash, though where the cash will be
found doesn’t appear.
To also carry out all promises made to soldiers
either before or after enlistment —not only promises
made by Ministers, but, it would seem, those made
by everybody else, authorised or otherwise.
To make such increases in war pensions from time
to time as shall keep the pensions up to living-wage
standard. (The living wage was recently defined in
N.S.W. as .775. per week, but may rise any day.)
To supply free house accommodation for life io
“totally disabled soldiers and widows and depen-
dent children of deceased soldiers.”
To build or buy enough Government-owned shins
to do the Commonwealth’s trade. On present quan-
tities this will require about 2,000,000 tons of ship-
ping—say, 200 vessels averaging 10,000 tons each.
At, say, £29 per ton, this would mean £58,000,000 ;
yet about the finding of the money not a word is
said. It is a great idea, but the men who really
do things make some mention about the raising of
the funds, and don’t assume that the gentle splosh
drops from Heaven.
Old-age and invalid pensions are to be increased
to £1 per week to begin with. The present average
is 12s. 2d., for some of the recipients have private
means and don’t get the full amount. The increase
will be about £3,000,000 a year.
Pensions are to be granted to widows, orphans and
children whose fathers can’t or-don’t maintain them;
also to the unemployed under an insurance scheme.
No mention is made of the expected cost. Also
there is to be free medical and dental treatment—
no estimate either.
Producers in general are to be guaranteed a price
which will corer cost of production and show “a
reasonable margin of profit.” In many mines gold
costs from £5 to £lOO per ounce to produce in
some years, and there are plenty of patches of
wheat in the drought country that cost £5 a
bushel. To guarantee every producer a profit beats
Hercules.
The funds of the Commonwealth Bank are to be
seized or diverted to provide loans for farmers—
apparently those who are so hard-pressed that they
must have money or quit, and presumably those who
have so little security to offer that the joint-stock
banks, having their depositors to think of and no
Government to back them, dare not lend to them.
The loans are to be “liberal,” which should put
the Bank out of its misery sooner. This is called
politically “a system of rural credits.”
Other promises, made in hulk—also, of
course, without any amounts or details or
explanations about finding the money—relate
to irrigation, afforestation, water conserva-
tion, ‘‘the construction and maintenance of
developmental roads and highways” (“de-
velopmental” is a good word, and apparently
the Commonwealth is to take the road job
from States and local bodies because it has
money to burn), and primary, technical and
agricultural instruction for country residents.
This Federal school system will either super-
sede the Slate systems and throw the
teachers out of work, or duplicate the State
systems so that the children will have to
attend two schools simultaneously. Yet a
great philosopher has laid it down that "a
man can’t he in two places at once unless he
is a bird.” Cost of duplicate schools should
certainly be set out in detail. Farmers and
other producers are to be insured against
loss by hail, frost, drought, loss of stock
and other misfortunes. “Other misfortunes”
are wide enough to cover unhappy marriage,
arrest, snake-bite, mother-in-law and mad-
ness; but Ryan is game to tackle any old
thing—on paper. Then :
Ports and harbors outside the capital cities are to
be “opened and equipped.” The N. S. Wales State
Labor crowd and the Federal Labor crowd promised
this all through their long years of office. Yet
where are those ports ?
“Liberal” advances are to be made to “workers”
so that they may acquire houses. The amount to be
granted, which may be £lOO,OOO or £100,000,000,
the interest to be charged, and the source of the
funds are left blank. Nor is it said how much will
be advanced on a £5OO house, whether £4OO or
£5OO or £6OO. The £6OO idea would be very
popular.
The present payment by the Commonwealth to
the States of 255. per inhabitant per annum is to
continue. Watt and other financiers say it is im-
possible, but there is nothing impossible about
Ryan—except the impossibility of believing him.
The income-tax and land-tax exemptions are not
to be altered except that £52 instead of £26 is
apparently to be allowed for each child. The amuse-
ment tax is to be abolished, which will be a loss,
but who cares for losses?
* * * *
These are a few of the more definite
features of the Ryan-Tudor brass-mining
prospectus, but the less definite ones are also
interesting. One of them is “the collective
ownership and democratic control of the col-
lectively-used agencies of production, distri-
bution and exchange.” This means, in less
flowery words, that the party in power is to
take possession of (i.e., buy with paper
money or steal) the farms (including sol-
diers’ farms), pastoral properties, shops,
warehouses, factox-ies, workshops, banks,
ships and many sundries. These are all
agencies of production, distribution and ex-
change, so they are all to be bought with
paper or taken without paper. Oversea
markets are to be found for exportable pro-
duce, though they have been found long ago
—the trouble is lack of ships to carry the
produce. These operations are to be ex-
tended even to the United States, where they
were extended years since, and are in full
and lamentable blast. The sugar industry
is to be put on a “permanently satisfactory
basis,” as if anything was permanent in this
flitting, fleeting, gibbering world. The basis
is to satisfy the worker as regards wages
and the buyer as regards price. New in-
dustries are to be protected, also “fostered
and developed,” and the workers “are to get
their full share of the benefits of the Pro-
tection.” As they are to own the industries
it is hard to see who else can get it. Woollen-
mills are to be built at indefinite expense
for the supply of all hands and the cook.
Arbitration between the workers who are
to own the industries and the proprietors
(who are abolished and have no stand-
ing any more than a corpse) is to be sim-
plified. Public servants are to have their
wages raised and have a pension fund. Some-
thing great and noble and far-seeing and
comprehensive is to be done with the luck-
less Northern Territory. Tudor held a
portfolio in four Federal Ministries, includ-
ing the one which filled the Territory with
Excellencies, brasshats, cocked hats, silly
pomp, ghastly expense and the seeds of revo-
lution ; but one might imagine from this
manifesto that someone else had done it.
while he is the reformer who is born
to put things right. Finally it is promised
that if Ryan and Tudor ( though Tudor
doesn’t seem" to count for much! are given
the free run of the Treasury and the Com-
monwealth Bank they will in return "pro-
vide for complete Australian self-govern-
ment as a British community.” And Aus-
tralia has this already, without letting Ryan
riot with the Treasury gold reserve ana
Commonwealth Bank funds.

A RELIC OF BYGONE AFFLUENCE.
W. M. Hughes’s colleague Joseph Cook
hinted last week that if the pfeople did not
presently cut out their luxurious ways, the
Government” would be impelled to do it
for them. lie meant, presumably, that eac 1
individual spendthrift’s State Government
would act, since high-living is in its essence
an intra-State proceeding, and so is out-
side the province of the Hughes Govern-
ment. But what an anomaly it would he 1
the present N. S. Wales Ministry penalise


a citizen for keeping too many servants, or
if the Theodore Government objected to
Queenslanders squandering such means
as it had left uncommandeered! For
the worst example of extravagance in
sight here at the present time is
supplied by neither Profiteer nor Plunger
but by the State administrative sys-
tems. In a word, by Federation. It is
not easy to see in true perspective that
which has existed for some time. It appears
right because it is familiar. Imagine, though,
our form of government in operation in
England. There is a bigger population and
more wealth in many an English county than
there is in any Australian State; and, until
the arrival of the railway, York or Exeter
was as far, relatively, from Whitehall as
Sydney or Adelaide is from Melbourne.
Under the Commonwealth system of govern-
ment there would be—in addition to the
Crown, the two Houses at Westminster and
the tremendous machinery of government
attached to them —an imitation Crown,
Lords and Commons, with everything neces-
sary to maintain their dignity as Sovereign
States, in Kent, Cheshire, Devon, and so
on. A Governor caste would probably spring
up in Loudon whose members would be
ready (for £SOOO a year and perquisites)
to proceed at short notice to any county,
with their wives, children, friends and re-
tainers, and there rule for fixed periods.
Under the Australian system no county
would be considered worthy to breed its
own Governors; and as the Sovereign State
idea is a notorious creator of inter-
provincial jealousy, the counties would be
unlikely to accept Governors from one
another. It might bo necessary, therefore,
in the cause of harmony, to import all
Governors from some such neutral spots as
the Channel Islands or the Outer Hebrides.
Kent becoming annoyed with Essex might
withhold its hops (as N. S. Wales withheld
its wheat in 1914) to the detriment of the
national beer industry; Colchester might
retaliate, on behalf of Essex, by declaring
Kent black as regards oysters, as Victoria
virtually declared the rest of Australia black
the other day in the matter of potatoes.
The English taxpayers would suffer from
the change in a thousand ways, direct and
indirect; and few would benefit except the
herds of officials which Federations, like
wars, create.
* * # *
No one was enthusiastic about our Fede-
ral system even in the now-vanished days
when the country could afford the luxury.
It was a compromise, at the best; and
nations do not love compromises, or coali-
tions or half-breeds: they only endure them.
Yet if the founders of Federation had tried
for a unificatory constitution like that of
Britain they would have got nothing. In
N. S. Wales a Victorian was still regarded
as a foreigner: worse, he was a sort of
traitor to the Mother State. Victoria had
good-natured ridicule for its neighbor and
old-fashioned rival; and both regarded the
inhabitants of the other States as outer bar-
barians. As recently as 1906, when G. 11.
Reid fought his Anti-Socialist campaign, the
strongest weapon in the armory of many
candidates was the “greed and selfishness”
of N. S. Wales, or Victoria, as the case hap-
pened to be. Since then an Australian Army
and Navy have arrived. A generation has
appeared which is hardly able to understand
the old battle-cries and the watchwords of
sectarianism, Geebungism and the rest. And,
finally, the flower of all the States have
fought side by side for five years, with the
result that, except for the purposes of a
cricket or football match, they are unable
to think any more in terms of States. They
are not Sydneyites or Adelaidians half so
much as they are Australians; and since
every healthy human being must have some
object of contempt and distrust, they deride
people on the other side of the earth instead
of wilfully misunderstanding one another. It
means that the only real justification the
Federal system ever had is gone. It was ap-
proaching the steep place in 1914; and the
war has kicked it right over the edge.
Who are the advocates of its perpetuation?
The keenest workers in the cause are natu-
rally the State politicians—those who are
already in one or other of the State Houses,
or have a likely chance of getting there.
They dread unification for the same reason
that a Royal family dreads republicanism or
a placeman retrenchment. And then there
are the provincials whom the new National
spirit has not touched. The world has not
changed for them : they still live in the epoch
of boundless pride of State expressed chiefly
in inter-State dislike. But they are being
weakened in numbers and vigor by the opera-
tion of that natural law which im-
pels reasonable persons, as their in-
comes decrease, to do away with their
superfluities. The taxpayers of the different
States could afford the pomp and circum-
stance of sovereignty once: the pageantry
of private Governors, imported and main-
tained at great cost, and of individual Upper
and Lower Houses, was within their means,
just as private packs of hounds were within
the means of certain Belgian nobles before
the German invasion. To-day Australia
owes £707,000,000, and more than half that
liability hangs about the necks of the States.
The Commonwealth may get £100.000,000
from Germany, but 30 years will pass first,
and meanwhile there is talk of a £25,000,000
war gratuity and of other disbursements.
Simultaneously with the greatest destruction
of world-wealth in history, and the greatest
rise in prices ever known, and the greatest
issue of inadequately-backed paper money on
record, there is occurring another phenome-
non. The whole community is taking a
line from the profiteers, and is reaching out
feverishly after the cash which the printing
presses are struggling so gamely to supply
as required. Wages are bounding up every-
where. The Tudor-Ryan party has lightly
mentioned its intention of nationalising bank-
ing, insurance and shipping; of building suf-
ficient shipping “for the whole Common-
wealth requirements, both for overseas and
inter-State trade”; of starting all returned
soldiers in civil life “without the payment
of interest or the repayment of capital”;
and of paying the war gratuity at once in
cash. All this at a time when the hours of
labor are being shortened and shortened again.
and when the nation is feeling the need of
the productivity of those who were killed
or maimed in the war! In fact, the col-
lective Australian taxpayer is in something
of the position of a man who used to have
£3OOO a year but now has only £1000; who
has a number of destitute or ailing relatives
to support; and who amongst the debris of
his past grandeur possesses a £ISOO motor-
car. The Federal system is our motor-car.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Sahara Australis.
“Should the present drought conditions continue until
Christmas time, another two months, a crash nothing
short of a national calamity will fall upon the whole
of the people of this State.... This drought is longer,
wider, deeper than ever 1902 was. When taken over
the whole State, at no time in 1902 could you say:
‘Two months longer and there will be a national
calamity.’ But you can say it now truthfully.’’
—Wkarne. M.L.A., secretary to the country commit-
tee of the Holman party, in Sydney Telegraph
■'i/lIJ’I'J), the anti-Prdtection paper which says
that people should go on the land.
The present drought, is naturally more ter-
rible than that of 1902 —the year of the li-
bushel wheat-crop, when the number of
sheep shorn dropped from 40,000,000 to
26,000,000 —because in the interval the
State has nearly ruined itself building rail-
ways and carrying people out to meet the
drought. Over 1,105,452 square miles of
Australia the annual rainfall is from lOin.
down to nothing. If, however, we only
write off everything with less than 15in.
in good seasons we get these results: —
Divisions of Australia.

Except that two or three railways must be
built ucross Sahara Australis for defence
purposes and to connect the oases east and
west and those north and south, these lines
are all the States should have seriously
troubled with for many years yet—that is
to say, until there is a solid population in
the fairly well-watered districts to pay for
adventures in Sahara. And as even the
fairly well-watered districts have devasta-
ting droughts at times (they are having one
now), their people want to devote them-
selves strenuously to drought-proof manufac-
turing industries. Instead, N. S. Wales, being
the maddest State of the lot, has built rail-
ways furiously in recent years out into its
122,265 square miles of Sahara. It has
acquired about 1800 miles of new loan line
since the 1902 drought, much of it out in
regions where rain worth mentioning hasn’t
been seen for 13 months. It is now run-
ning water-trains at ghastly expense to
barely save the lives of a few of its vic-
tims, and is carrying them food at nominal
rates, and is scraping up £1,000,000 to lend
to them (loan-money of course), and it
proposes to help tjiem at other people’s ex-
pense by giving them the right to refuse to
pay their debts. And with all these honest
and dishonest aids there is nothing to show
out in Sahara but lank woe, hollow-eyed
misery, wretchedness unspeakable and utter
lack of hope. If the State had a million
artisans engaged in drought-proof industries
and supplying the urgent needs of the local
market, there might be enough people to pay
the losses of the ghastly experiment of
Sahara settlement, but the existing handful
can’t. Something of the evil arises from a
sort of insane pride which prevents the
Australian admitting that he owns a desert,
but most of the matter is simply political
corruption. Meantime the tariff which
might make some drought-proof industries
is postponed, and the crime of sending re-
turned soldiers out to Sahara proceeds
gaily.
The Profiteer’s New Friends.
The Tudor-Ryan attitude towards the pro-
posed Constitutional alterations is peculiar.
"In our opinion,” says the party manifesto,
“they are merely. intended to mislead the
electors as to the policy of the Nationalist
Government on the question of profiteering
and other matters of vital importance to the
welfare of the workers.” And the authors
who call themselves Laborites intend to
oppose that which 'Labor has been struggling
for ever since the High Court gave its deci-
sion in the matter of the Trade Marks Act
(1905), the ultra-Laboristic object of which
was to inform the consumer whether the
goods had been manufactured by Union or
Free labor. The Hughes party is pledged
to a raised tariff, and so are its opponents.
Under the decision on the Excise Tariff Act
(1906), no Federal legislation is possible
which will ensure for the workers a share of
the benefits accruing from any extra duties
that may be imposed. And the Tudor-
Ryanites propose to keep that state of
affairs in operation! They call themselves
anti-profiteers; and they do not intend to
give the Commonwealth Parliament those
powers which it for the first time realised
it lacked when the Australian Industries Pre-
servation Act was declared unconstitutional
—powers, that is, to tackle the profiteering
which goes on inside the borders of individual
States, and which represents about 95 per
cent, of the whole! If the vote on the sug-
gested amendments were given next Decem-
ber on non-party lines, as it ought to be,
there is no doubt that it would be in the
affirmative. If, however, the change is to be
opposed by the very class which needs it
most, then the Trust magnates and the pro-
fiteers are indeed on a good wicket. They
are to be further enriched to make
a campaign director’s holiday. The view
Mr. T. J. Ryan takes of the situation is
understandable. Being a party politician he
is opposed to the amendments primarily
because the other side wants them. Suppose
they were carried, and that W. M. Hughes,
in the brief time at his disposal, used them
to in some way minimise profiteering. It
would be good business for the downtrodden
toiler, but fatal to the interests of T. J.
Rya-n. The Ryan type of politician will
see the submerged beneath the harrow
indefinitely, rather than have them lifted out
of their agony by the hand of a rival. So
overmastering is Ryan's desire that
Hughes shall not be able to do anything
effective for the workers if the Nationalists
get in, that he apparently disregards the
contingency that Labor may win. The lat-
ter possibility is on the cards; but this,
anyhow, is certain—that no party led by
one with Ryan’s disastrous Queensland
record will ever be granted even such limited
powers as Hughelb is seeking. There is
the alternative, of course, that “Labor’s next
Prime Minister” may actually prefer office
with impotence. In the first place it will
give him an opportunity of explaining that
his monstrous programme was wrecked by
some other agency than its inherent idiocy.
And, secondly, if a sufficient number of real
grievances are left unredressed for a
long enough period, something is bound to
burst, with Labor in its present temper. So
the path may be opened up for Direct Ac-
tion and the dawn of the Revolution.
[J. B. Dailey, 214 George-street, Sydney.]
The Distance Between Producer and
Consumer.
“One method by which some relief can be
gained from the high cost of living,” says a
Sydney paper, “is by bringing producer and
consumer closer together.” That is just
what the people at Mullurabimby and Mur-
rumburrah in Northern N. S. Wales are say-
ing now; and they are backed by Alston-
ville, Ballina, Bangalow, Baryulgil, Billinud-
gel, Binna Burra, Booyong, Brooklet, Bur-
ringbar, Cob-o’-Corn, Condong, Coorabell
Creek, Crabbe’s Creek, Cudgera Creek, Cud-
gen, Cumbalam, Dorrougliby, Dunbible Creek,
Duranbah, Eltham, Ettrick, Eureka, Evan’s
Head, Fingal Head, Grevillea, Knockrow,
Lillian Rock, Mantle, Nashua, Ne wry bar,
Nimbin, North Tumbulgum, Opossum Creek,
Piggabeen, Rous Mill, South Kyogle, Stoker’s
Siding, Teven, Tintenbar, Tyagarah, Uki,
Whian-Whian, Wiangaree, Wollombar,
Woodburn and Zara. All these are postal
towns in Northern N. S. Wales, almost ail
in good country, all producers, and all very
small because they are over GOO miles from
the consumer in Sydney—the only consumer
who is allowed to grow big enough to count,
and the only one that they are allowed
facilities (if they can be called facilities)
to trade with, though in the case of some of
them Brisbane is a mere 60 or 80 miles away.
Therefore they are very wild, even wilder than
their hairy names would suggest; and they
propose to secede from N. S. Wales, and thus
have a big capital of their own with a con-
sumer of their own in it who will be nearer
to the producer. Also they propose to make
their own connections with Brisbane, and
thus get close up to another big consumer.
The movement isn’t confined to places like
Dunbible Creek which are over the 600-
mile mark. It includes pretty nearly every-
thing north of Kempsey, where the Brisbane
military district commences. The N. 8.
Wales North Coast has been flattered with a
bit of railway chiefly to serve as evidence in
Sydney that the metropolis is a large-minded
place, and that anybody who wants to break
away from it is as unreasonable as the
Irish Home-Ruler seems to the English Tory.
The line is largely unballasted. The trains
do a camel-trot on it amid clouds of dust.
The locomotives are Sydney’s cast-offs, and
the carriages are replete with every ancient
inconvenience and fitted up according to the
earliest models. As it is evidently meant
to be always thus, the movement for bring-
ing the producer closer to the consumer, or
at least bringing the consumer closer to the
producer, gains strength on the Northern
Tableland and along the Northern Rivers.
Mullumbimby is solid on it, and Piggabeen
and Stoker’s Siding can be relied on. The
One Big City press says that the idea of
electing secession delegates to the Federal
Parliament is purposeless and illogical, but
wonderful things, are sometimes done in an
illogical way. Victoria achieved its separa-
tion by the expedient of electing six British
Cabinet Ministers as its representatives at
Sydney, and then notifying them that they
were to the Botany Bay Legislature in
the Separation interest, and were expected
to do their duty. The astonished men did
their duty when the matter was thus brought
before them, though they didn’t come to
Botany Bay to do it. The whole proceed-
ing was illogical enough to satisfy anybody.
Yet Victoria got a decree nisi.
-
The Strike on the Sunset Railway.
The newest strike on Australia’s East-to-
West railway has features of its own. One
is that there has just been an arbitration
and a new award with considerable increase
of wages, and as the award was dated back
to October 14, 1918, there was a year’s
increase payable to the men. The reply to
this was a demand for all the Court had
granted; for all that had been asked but
which the Court hadn’t granted; and fox-
concessions which the employees hadn’t even
asked of the Court. Also there was a
demand for pi’ompt surrender on the part of
the Government, and a strike opened even
before there was time for an answer to the
demand for prompt surrender. This was all
the more unpardonable because the Govern-
ment would of course have surrendered. It
always does. Sometimes it makes a small
attempt to save its face; but in any case it
straightway proceeds to reproduce the con-
ditions that will inevitably produce another
strike and another surrender. There is
indeed only one way of attacking the problem
which is vaguely described as “industrial
unrest,” and that is by shutting down on
the. loan policy and letting conditions find
their level. There is a level somewhere, but
while the country is dizzy and drunk with
paper money and loan money and wages
on jobs where it is possible to pay
20s. for os. worth of results because
posterity foots the bill,, the level will
never be found. An amazing feature
is that the stodgy and (in their own
opinion) level-headed classes who com-
plain most bitterly that their world is tight
and upside-down, pass the bottle as assidu-
ously as anybody else. The lavish abund-
ance of depreciated paper and depi-eciated
bonds and other trash makes high prices,
and high prices help to make strikes,
on which professional incendiaries thrive;
and strikes make unemployment, and
unemployment leads to more paper with
which to meet the evil by means of
public works that are an eternal burden,
and work of this sort paid in paper makes
reproductive toil seem more or less super-
fluous, and steady industry also more or less
superfluous. Politics are full of doctors who
are perpetually putting paper plasters on the
symptoms, but no one attacks the disease.
A Little Industry Juooks Up.
It is understood that the Repatriation De-
partment will look‘more kindly—or, at least,
with a shade less ferocious hostility—on
the hand-woven (Anzac) tweed industry
provided it can be convinced that there is
a demand for the Anzac goods. The stipula-
tion may put the industry in a hole, for these
are about all the arguments it can advance:
(1) That it made a good though small beginning
under the War Council before there was any Repatri-
ation Department with a Freetrader at the head of
it, and then a blight fell on it. It was paying fair
wages and showed a profit, but being the first
manufacturing industry started for crippled soldiers
it naturally felt the first effects of the importers’
displeasure.
(2) That it had some years’ orders ahead when
the blight arrived in the shape of a stoppage of
supplies of yarn.
(3) That, judged by the importing returns, there
is a local market worth several millions a year avail-
able all the time and always growing.
(4) That it can and does supply better tweed at
less than the importer charges—with the proviso
that it requires an adequate supply of yarn from the
Commonwealth mills. If it has to depend on the
process of sending wool to England at six times the
old freights, and having it turned into yarn there,
and then sent back at the same enormous freights
with foreign profiteers piling up the charges both
ways, and an importer finally piling up more here,
the case is hopeless.
These are all the evidences the hand-woven
tweed industry has to show for its per-
manency, and if they won’t satisfy the Re-
patriation Department there is little more
to be said. When it is a matter of rushing
soldiers on to dubious land with a £lOOO
mortgage apiece to grow wheat for a market
12,000 miles away which it now costs 6s.
a bushel to reach, so that the only hope lies
in conveying the produce by local railway
at half-cost and giving the grower a Govern-
ment guarantee to boot—when it is that
kind of matter the industry isn’t required to
give any kind of evidence that it is or has
the remotest hope of 'being a paying affaii-.
But in a matter which threatens the in-
terests of the importer the affidavit of a
drove of archangels may be hardly sufficient.
And that is almost a pity because this looks
a simple and not very heavy job which could
be followed by small groups of men in little
workshops all over the country, where the
raw material grows. It might not be a
gigantic business, but it was the first sign
of a revolt against the foreign war-time
profiteer, and like ' the first symptom of
heresy it had to be put down. Incidentally,
it is significant of the alliance between the
new school of Labor leaders and the import-
ing profiteers that the said leaders showed
no sign of interest in the matter. Any
charge of profiteering, even to the extent of
earning a precarious 5 per cent, dividend, is
an excuse for attacking an Australian manu-
facture, but though the importer may occa-
sionally be denounced in a general way his
sacredness when it comes down to details
leaves the Ark of the Covenant nowhere.

Work—Yes, but What Work?
Prime Minister Hughes has become teacher
of the Gospel of Industry. Said he in a
recent speech :
Five million people have to carry a war debt ot
£400,000,000 and the economic loss involved in the
death of 60,000 young men and the disablement of
40,000 more. We are living on capital—it is as if
a man was drinking his own blood. There is one
plain and obvious course—the production of moii
wealth.... There is only one way out. It is work.
Let every Australian get his shoulder into the collar.
It is solemn truth, for with more women,
children, aged folk and invalids to support
than ever, and 100,000 fewer men to sup-
port them, only cowards and traitors preach
the doctrine of go-slow and the six-hour day
these times. _ But something might also be
said about doing profitable and reproductive
work. Building pyramids and statues of
Jupiter is work. A soldier works very hard
when he stands in the sun for six hours in
all his heavy trappings in attendance on a
useless Kaiser. Wharf-lumping—the push-
ing of raw material that we ought to manu-
facture ourselves, and the pulling of finished
goods that we ought to make ourselves, on
and off ships that we ought to build for our-
selves—is exceedingly stiff work. The build-
ing with money borrowed at 6 per cent, of
the railway from Dryvale in the county of
Knowhere to Bone Mountain in the county
of Gordelpus, where the interest and most
of the working expenses are dead loss and a
burden on the taxpayer—that is real work,
too, and very hot work. And genuine work
is done a't some of the places where his
colleague Millen is putting returned sol-
diers on the land—to plough and sow and
harrow three acres for six bushels of wheat,
and cart water six miles and watch the horse
drink half of it on the road, and listen to
the mortgage gibbering by night. All these
things are work, and so is building a cath-
edral or fighting a bigger man than yourself
about nothing in particular. If Hughes
would loaf on some of these jobs, and make
his colleague Millen loaf also, and cut off
Holman’s supply of loans and tell him to
go to bed and shirk, it might be cheaper in
the end. On the other hand, it might have
been a good thing if Hughes or Watt or
somebody had got up more of a perspiration
over the tariff and the shipbuilding business.

inevitable it is well that a policeman should
be near the house at the time; and analo-
gously it is better that we should have our
inevitable highwaymen of industry on the
spot rather than that they should operate to
our detriment in Tokio or Chicago. The
goods which arrive from abroad over a low-
tariff wall may have helped to bloat a.
foreign profiteer before they were displayed;
and by the time the consumer gets them they
may have done their share in the bloating off
a dozen other local profiteers. A drastic tariff:
could put an embargo on such robbery abroad.
And, as regards almost everything that really
matters, it might be limited here in at least:
two ways. Firstly, by the exposure of the:
guilty. This proved very effective with both,
profiteers and hoarders in the United King-
dom ; and it ought to show even better re-
sults in a smaller and more literate com-
munity such as this. And, secondly, by run-
ning the rule over every profit made from the
factory to the retailer, and proceeding crim-
inally against any offending link in the dis-
tributive chain. But nothing of the sort
can be done to any purpose till the Aus-
tralian Government is given power to govern.
[J. B. Dailey, 214 George-street, Sydney.!
A Little Ray of Sunshine.
“Trallwm” inquires:—
What about a little optimism for a change ?
A vast amount of rubbish is being talked about the
high cost of living and the poverty that goes with
£lO a week; and quite ordinary civil servants have
had to have their £750 a year raised to £B5O to
save them from starvation.
Here is the other side.
We (that’s my wife and I) may be termed of the
iiitelligenzia, the bourgeoisie, the middle class, the
.noboeraey—brought up to church sittings, servi-
ettes, aitches, daily and weekly papers, frequent
baths, the entertainment of numerous long-staying
relatives and a proper reverence for the National
Federation ajid suburban mayoresses. For the whole
of our married life our income has averaged £l9l
(all by personal exertion; pretty damned hard, too) ;
during the war years £243, and for three of the
latter (I being away from home and obliged to pay
board) we ran what amounted to two homes. Though
never affluent (since the 50s. a week days in 1906)
we have never been pinched for money. Starting
with £6O, a bicycle and two pre-marriage certificates
of health and probable fecundity, we now own (free
of encumbrance) the furnishings of a five-roomed
house (about £2OO insurance value), a piano-
( £B5), £3OO in the Savings Bank, £7O in War
bonds, a £3OO life insurance policy, a £2B type-
writer and a £l4 sewing-machine; and we have
laid by from the day of their birth a shilling a week
dot for our daughters. (There are only two chil-
dren — all the good God and native caution have
sent us; but we never blocked any, nor tampered
with ourselves.) I was able to give that good
partner my wife £5O for herself on her last birth-
day. We have (and always have had) all the
clothes and hoots we want, as well as a dress-suit
each. I belong to four non-benefit, moderately-
expensive lodges; the wife pays for a pew. We
each have our vice—hers temperance and religion ;
mine the theatre-—and we gratify them worthily. The
children go to (and have always gone to) a private
school ; and they learn music, dancing, calisthenics,
(locution, and the rest (all “extras” in the bill) of
the childish atrocities. We have never refused a
patriotic appeal, a War Loan sub., a swagman at
the door, nor to buy a button or a house badge. We
pay a weekly sum to the Red Cross, the W.C.T.U.,
the Strength of Empire, the Protestant Federation,
a library, and take two dailies, two weeklies and a.
monthly paper. I belong to one of the professional
unions, and supported the Repertory movement while
it lived. We join in all the War memorials, pre-
sentations, church stunts and sundries that snob-
ocraey adores. We always have a boh (even several)
to spare for emergencies.
I don’t set out all the foregoing for self-righteous-
ness' sake: I merely state the facts. I don’t know
how it is done: I never inquired. What weekly
sum the wife thinks necessary to the house-running
I give, and ask no questions. If she gets behind, I
pay up.
I may say in explanation that we spend practically
nothing on doctors’ bills. As we don’t affect lobster
suppers and Veuve Cliquot, nor bring the youngsters
up on cinemas, ice-creams and late nights, we don't
need doctor’s attention often, and we don’t pay
into a benefit and sickness-encouragement lodge. Our
doctor charges 7s. 6d. a time—a powerful prophy-
lactic. I don’t pursue my vice at 6s. a night: I go
at seven o’clock with a book and sit in the fourth
to tenth seat from the centre of the front row of
the theatre gallery, at 2s. early door. We don't
buy sirloin at Is. a pound: we were reared on a
selection where one ate through the animal from the
horns to the hocks, so we know there are other
joints. I pander to a snobbish desire to give the
children a “college” education by means of casual
pars, sold to The Bulletin and others. I have
to own to having few friends, so don't have
to shout much; and I don’t include in my invest-
ments “sure things” at Flemington, nor the chase
of royal flushes at poker—but every man has his
limitations. Above all things, I don’t strike. I
haven’t been out of a job more than an aggregate
three months in 18 years, nor in any job more than
four years —but I’ve done nearly every blessed tiling
in Australia hut cane-cutting, company promoting
.and being a union secretary. Every man has his
standards.
In short, I've everything in the world I want (I
•don’t want what’s out of my £ 243-long reach: it’s
too wearying) ; so, she tells me, has my wife, and
this incessant cry about unemployment and the high
cost of living makes me very tired.
N. S. Wales industrial law is in au appal-
ling muddle, and unless it gets out ot' the
tangle movable industries will be shifted
across the border and new industries will
start in Vic. rather than in N. S. Wales.
For some time the legal minimum wage was
£B, and the Board of Trade lately “declared”
it to be £3 17s. The Board arrived at
that by estimating the cost of living of a
man, his wife and two children. As there
are many men who haven’t two children
while many have more, the result would be
to pay some of the lowest-grade workers
more than was necessary and others less
than was necessary for decent comfort. The
intention of the Government’s Children’s
Maintenance Bill was excellent —it proposed
to have a living wage declared for a man
and his wife, and to require employers to
pay into a fund a certain amount per em-
ployee out of which men with children would
receive so much per child. But the bill was
hastily thrown together, and badly handled
at that. If it doesn’t go through, 17s. a
week will be added to the wages of all men
{except those in domestic service and rural
industries) receiving less than £lO per week

under a State award. Then up will go the
cost of living again—nothing is more cer-
tain than that —and there will have to be
another Board of Trade inquiry, with an-
other increase in the basic wage; and so
the thing will go on. How this is going
to improve anybody’s position Heaven only
knows. A self-supporting community with
no foreign trade could call the humble bob
a pound if it liked and nobody would be any
the better off. But if it had a foreign trade
the people who would be far worse off would
be those who have to sell their product in
foreign parts in competition with the world.
And that is what is going to play the devil
with our wheatgrowers and miners.
Thomas Gnat (whose other name is James
Edmond, and cheques may be posted to either
of them at 214 George-street, Sydney)
offers advice: —
Sitting on my verandah the other evening with
a fly on my bald spot to prevent me falling asleep,
it struck me that the Rationalists have made a mis-
take about T. J. Ryan of Queensland. He should
have been treated more diplomatically, and I don t
think that any man responds better to kindly dip-
lomatic treatment. He was, so far as 1 can find
out, a schoolmaster, which was also the profession
' of Mr. Squeers and Mr. Creakle ; also, he. was a
barrister, the same as Sergeant Buzfuz, only with
less practice. His early ambition was to be what
would now be called a Nationalist member; hut
he failed, so he became a La’ior member. The
question remains whether his sympathies are not
really with his old friends, and whether it wouldn’t
have been well to hold out the olive-branch to
Ryan. As for myself, I think of promoting the
Skinflint party, which will prohibit all borrow-
ing, Federal and St te, save for the renewal of old
loans : will exercle the Commonwealth’s power to
take over all State debts; and will create a sinking
fund against all of them—a party, in fact, which
will put Honesty and Solvency first. I may yet
offer Ryan the leadership of the Skinflint party
and the Prime Ministership if he carries the Skin-
flint banner to victory. Hughes could be made
High Commissioner with a 10-years’ appointment and
a knighthood. By way of providing Ryan with a
safe seat I would give him a free run in Bruce
Smith's constituency and offer sufficient inducement
to the British Government to make Bruce .Smith
a duke by way of compensation. I don't know any
man who would make a better duke than proud,
honest, bigoted Bruce Smith. If Ryan feared to
give up one shadow for another I wouldn’t object
to him running as a Labor candidate in one place
and a Skinflint-Nationalist in another, and having
his choice of leaderships and developing two set-
of principles at once. Or three. Lowell once
wrote of Zachary Taylor:—-
“Ez fer my princerples, I glory
In hevin’ nothin’ of the sort.
I ain’t a Whig, I ain’t a Tory;
I’m jest a—Candidate, in short.”
That doesn’t apply. Zachary Taylor had no prin-
ciples. Ryan is full of all sorts of them. Any-
body who listens at the door of his waistcoat to
the principles buzzing within him would take him
for a beehive.

Flying-man Captain Roy King’s view
Lieutenant Pickles (B. 23/10/’l9), referring to
the quality of ’planes on their way to Australia, says
“they are probably second-hand fighting machines,
of doubtful value for commercial purposes.” Speaking
with authority for my own company (the Larkin-
Sopwith), the machines which we are importing are
all, without exception, of post-war design and con-
struction, and come direct (after tests) from the
Sopwith factory to Australia. I am as anxious as
Lieut. Pickles to promote aviation in Australia ; but
T am satisfied that aeroplanes cannot at present he
manufactured here. Parts of the wood work could
be, but it would be necessary to import engines,
fabric, instruments and, in fact, practically all the
most vital and expensive parts. Why not let us
get on with the job of showing the Australian people
the possibilities of aviation for commercial purposes?
When we have accomplished this, start to manufac-
ture locally if you like. Otherwise aviation here is
going to fall as flat as a flounder. Incidentally, I
agree with Lieut. Pick les that we need Common-
wealth Government control of aviation, and it is
quite time we had it.
The new head, the Knightly Steward, has
begun to reform the Vic. police force. At
Henley and the Y.R.C. races the troopers
turned out with the old Martini-Henry car-
bines dangling in leather buckets at the
horses’ sides. These relics of. the bush-
ranging days comprise part of the mounted
men’s “full dress,” and “Sir George,” him-
self immaculate, has decreed that full dress
shall be worn on such festive occasions.
William Macgregor laid the foundations of
the present high ideals of governing Percy
Papua and his sister Lisi. His first official
act in 1888 was the promulgation of an
ordinance prohibiting the sale or gift to abo-
riginal Papuans of arms, opium or liquor.
As a result Papua to-day is the only British
nigger colony quite free from the opium
traffic. There has never been a single breach
of the law since Mac unfurled the Flag in
’BB. The resident Europeans have helped
loyally, for the moral standard of the Aus-
tralians and Englishmen, who are the major
portion of the population, is very high in-
deed. Mac was a dour Puritan and from
the very first days of his long pro-consulship
frowned upon the brown lady housekeeper,
too; so the Possession to-day is not much
stained by the weird greeds that defile
Broome and Darwin.
Note from an Australian accountant at
Itorseferry-road : —•
Pressure was recently put on the Government in
the House to collect money due by big creditors,
and an urgent letter was addressed to the A.I.F.
begging a remittance on account of the £40,000,000
Australia owes. Our reply was that there was
nothing doing. Still, most extravagant expenditure
goes on: hordes of highly-paid officers are drawing
their very liberal daily rates, with subsist allowance
of 10s. per day (minimum) up to 255. Many are
anxious to get away, of course, but there are few
ships, and intrigue is necessary now to get a possie
oa a boat that will land home before Christmas,
’the pay and upkeep of our men still in England
(4/'9/’l9) is so great that extreme measures for
early repatriation would pay. For the month of
August the actual pay drawn by A.I.F. in Britain
and France alone was £226,000, which excludes sub-
sistence, allotments, gratuities, deferred pay, etc.
The Heads are urgent for more boats, but the Ship-
ping Pool doesn’t help at all.
A deputation from Melbourne Trades Hall
lately dropped in on the State Governor to
demand that working hours shall be limited
to 40 per week. The great question is
whether a man can earn enough even if he
gets the full product of his labor — i.e., can
he create enough wealth —in 40 hours to keep
him and his family housed, clothed, fed,
drinked, smoked, educated and amused for
168 hours, and provide for the very large
class of necessary non-producers (policemen,
doctors, nurses, show-people, invalids, pat-
riarchs, lunatics, scavengers, members of
Parliament, telephone girls, people engaged
on unfinished public works and others) and
furnish something to pay off the war debt?
Can he do this, especially when he has 128
hours for spending in? Certainly people work-
ing lone-hand industries —cocky farmers, iso-
lated miners, owners of one-man shops and
workshops, etc. —can’t. Neither can house-
wives. There were 260,000 of these skirted,
sweated, ill-paid toilers in Victoria on last
census day, and they represented the over-
whelmingly big industry of the State.
“Simon” : A recent meeting, in the arrange-
ments for which the Premier of N. S. Wales
is alleged to have taken a hand, with the re-
sult that things turned out quite satisfac-
torily for his friend, recalls an old experi-
ence of Holman’s. Twenty years ago he
was a candidate for Grenfell. His “pro-
Boer” utterances had preceded him, and the
61ite of the town—grocers’ assistants, bank
clerks and such —were resolved upon “roast-
ing” him at his first meeting. Deaf Ike
Smith, afterwards Labor candidate for the
Senate, was a few miles along the railway
line with a gang of navvies. Holman went
to him and explained what was afoot; also
the advantage it would be to have a score
of husky, fair-minded and disinterested
people like the boys scattered round to watch
things. “It’s all right, Bill,” said Ike.
“we’ll be there, an’ if they open their
mouths we’ll talk to ’em.” They were
there, and Holman addressed the quietest
meeting on record.
“1921” : When I praise the work of the
Enzeds, as all men of the A.L.11. must who
went through the desert campaigns, I am
often asked how they could be into every-
thing, ready and willing. There is only
one answer. It was because Maoriland had
conscription. When our regiment was re-
duced to' a skeleton through malaria and
losses in action, and our horses were either
dead or nearly so. we had to spell for rein-
forcements and remounts. But the Enzeds’
cons were quickly tilled with eager men, and,
conscript or volunteer, they were all game.
It meant, too, that veterans were able to
get long leave. Still, the Enzecl who was in
at the start and came out sound at the
finish must have had as many lives as a
suburban cat.
Two opinions:—
The oustanding feature of the American of to-day
is his extremely good feeling towards Australians,
and there is no doubt they are very keen to extend
their trade with Australia.- — Braddon, merchant, and
lately official Trade Commissioner to the United
States.
Australia is looked upon in America as a place to
get money from, not to send money to. — H. I’.
McKay, Australian manufacturer.
McKay is right. Uncle Sam, like every
other keen business man, can understand
and appreciate the country which puts up
a big tariff barrier like his own, declares
it can make its own goods and find its own
loans, and says that if he wants to trade he
must give concessions in return for con-
cessions. But he has nothing but scorn for
a country that sends Braddons and Shel-
dons to truckle to him about loans because
the Old Man in London, whom we have
borrowed from hitherto, is hard-pressed, and
to point out the opportunities here for the
Yankee (absentee) capitalist. The U.S.
had a man of its ow T n called Benedict
Arnold, who pointed out to the British the
way through Washington’s defences when
G. Washington was hard up, and it looks
coldly- on Arnold even now.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Promises of a new heaven and a new earth
are copiously poured out by Tudor, Storey
and Ryan, and a stranger who reads or hears
them must get the impression that these men
are new arrivals with a perfectly fresh gospel.
But turn to the facts. During the last nine
years Labor has had about six years of
Federal office, and for three years more the
Ministry has consisted mostly of Laborites
ejected from the party merely on the war
issue. In N. S. Wales Labor had six years
of office and three years of the same half-
and-half kind of office, with the old Labor
leader as Premier. In Queensland it has
had 41 years’ office out of the last nine
years; about four years in 8. Aus. and
nearly five in Westralia. Tudor has been
in four Ministries; Gardiner in two; Higgs
in one; Turley in-one; Ryan in one; and
John Storey in none, for ever when the party
was in power with nine portfolios to give
away it never dreamed that John was bright
enough for the smallest of them. Now these
old hacks claim to be judged solely by what
they promise to do in the future! The op-
portunities they lost in the past are surely
worth considering.
Queensland State Parliament closed with
a sudden bang, and without the presentation
of estimates which can’t appear now till
towards the end of January, when seven
months’ money will have been spent without
authority and be beyond recall. Premier
Theodore was told flatly that the finances
were so much worse than even last year’s
awful record that he dare not produce them

until after the Federal elections lest Ryan’s
chances should be damaged, but Theodore
only smiled and changed the subject by an-
nexing per proclamation all the cattle and
sheep in the State. The owners will pre-
sumably get 41 per cent, debentures in ex-
change. Queensland can stand a lot of
shocks. Still Theodore and co. are making
a fair bid to find out the breaking-point.
President Givens, one of the “economists"
of the Federal Parliament, has a clerk
from the House hurrying round Banana-
land as his secretary. But there is a rule
of license in these matters which grows in
accordance with the size of the chief’s
salary. Thus Speaker Johnson still charges
the Commonwealth with the travelling ex-
penses of an attendant. But where almost
every M.P. dips variously and surrep-
titiously into the country’s cash-box, such
little perks are lost in the crush. For in-
stance, two or three inter-State members
have made the Commonwealth finance ice
carriage of their families to Melbourne,
though all of them are fond of Economy
as a party cry.
Westralian Government is submitting the
State Constitution for repairs. Among the
items to be patched is the franchise qualifi-
cation for the Leg. Council. The existing
right to vote is the occupancy of a house of
a clear annual value of £l7. or possession of
a freehold estate of a clear value of £5O.
The former qualification has been the source
of endless difficulties owing to the lack of a
definite method of arriving at the values. It
is proposed to substitute occupation of a per-
manent habitation for which rent is paid
at the rate of not less than Os. Gd. a
week, or which is of a rental value of not
less than Gs. Gd. a week. This is fairly

“Mr. Fraser (Chief Commissioner of N. S. Wales

ous effect on the railways. Water supplies were

simple, though not so simple as declaring
merely that the voter shall be an adult
citizen—the preliminary to the abolition of
the second Chamber. ' But the single-
Chamber opinion has sustained a set-back
during the last year or so. The threats
of the Walshes and the Bolshes have caused
many good democrats to hesitate to throw
overboard any sort of buffer. The revolu-
tionary asses represent a not very consider-
able minority in the Labor movement, but
their bray is loud, and terrifying to some
people.
In Victoria during 10 months of this
year, to October 31, the transactions under
the Transfer of Land Act reached 66,510,
which is 410 more than for the whole of
1888, the year the land boom reached its
most bloated stage. It is explained that
most of the transfers are of property in
and near Melbourne. According to Harold
Templeton, the Registrar-General, the busi-
ness has a stability that was lacking in the
boom period; yet, accepting that as true, the
bloating i s none the less undesirable be-
cause it is permanent. With the area under
cultivation less than it was before the war.
the increase of population in one centre, is
only something to curse.
Labor has a chance to lose 11 Senators
and win seven next month. N. S. Wales
is the only State in which the party has
nothing better to hope for. In Queensland
Turley wants to join Ferricks and Maughan.
“.John Drayman” Woods, ex-Speaker of the
Tas. Assembly, is the new candidate in the
Island; and Findley is joined with retiring
Senators Barker and Barnes in Victoria.
Grealey and Lundie —who will be called to
order 15 times in the first fortnight—are new
candidates in S. Aus.; and Gorman and
Graham are coupled with retiring Senator
Needham in the West.
On October 9-10 the Vic. rail-
ways failed to truck sufficient chaff
to Melbourne to meet the normal
demand, and the price was
promptly shot up from £ll to £l2.
The Profiteering Commission says
this rise was “improper.” Follow-
ing the issue of the report there
was a discussion in Parliament.
Snowball and Greenwood de-
nounced any regulation that would
protect a producer who thus
squeezed out extra money for food
for man or beast; but the House
didn’t agree with them. At the
back of its head was the idea that,
under present conditions, life “on
the land” is such a beggarly exist-
ence that ordinary rules of conduct
can’t be applied to it. Of course,
this isn’t admitted in words; but
there are times when actions speak loudest.
The Digger isn t the only man who knows
that an election is coming and that Hughes
wants votes. The copper-gouger is calling
around, too. Ho wants what he calls “re-
tention money.” Back in
1918 W. M. Hughes sold
Australia's copper to Eng-
land at a price well below
what other countries were
getting from the Allies. He
further agreed that from the
purchase price there should
be deducted £5, which should
net be payable until the cop-
per was shipped. From that
day to this a great deal of
the copper has not been
shipped. The £5 per ton is
the retention money which
the gouger is now looking
for. If Hughes had been
the capable negotiator that
he tells himself he is, he
would have contracted for
the buyer to shift
the copper within, say,
four months, or, alterna-
tively, pay for it in full
within that time. As it is
(1) the copper was sold
below the market price; (H)
the buyers put up about 95
per cent, of the purchase
price, and (3) apparently
they can go on owing
the balance until the Day
of Judgment if they don’t
ship the metal in the mean-
time.
Considering the Bahia
Castillo troopship scandal,
about which so much has
been heard, and the Wai-
mana scandal, of which Aus-
tralia is beginning to hear,
it almost looks as if Senator
Pearce might as well have remained in Aus-
tralia and attended to the job he is paid for,
instead of bungling his way to London with
a “suite” to interfere in the demobbing busi-
ness;. '
In the Labor manifesto it is complained
bitterly that the Hughes Government let
Japan obtain a footing in the Caroline and
Marshall islands, and “through its unsound
policy had given a great and ambitious
Power a base within easy reach of Aus-
tralian shores.” Two or three years ago, at
the Perth Labor Conference time, shabby
traitors were clamoring that the brutal Ger-
man enemy should be allowed to retain his
fortified posts in Papua, right alongside Aus-
tralian territory, in the Solomons. Carolines.
Pellews, Mariannes. Marshalls, etc., as well
as in East and South-West Africa. If
Ryan wasn't one of those pro-llun, no
annexation-and-no-indemnity people they
certainly seemed to regard him in that light,
and he did not raise Cain in disowning and
denouncing them.
The worst thing about a Dominating Per-
sonality is that it scorns details. Thus
Hughes, in his “policy” speech : —-
The advantages of Government organisation with
regard to sugar are particularly striking. Under
the Government scheme the grower, the worker and
the consumer benefited by fixed prices and high
wage*
Well, seeing that most of the would-be
consumers in parts of Australia, including
Melbourne, haven’t seen any white, and
precious little brown, sugar for months, and
that a shortage has existed off and on since
November, 1918. the results are striking,
though it isn’t easy to perceive any advan-
tages. The Melbourne housewife who wants •
to make a fair quantity of jam can’t get
a bag of white sugar for love or money.
The advantages to the jam manufacturer
are obvious. Is it he whom Hughes calls ,
the “consumer”?
Strawboard is a necessary commodity used
in the manufacture of heavy cardboard
boxes and produced in large quantities ,in
Holland, where it is made of stable manure
and other unconsidered trifles. Australia

SITTING.
THE LITTLE SPORT: "Now then, jump, or
I fire!"
lias two factories, both in Melbourne, and
at present they are unable to meet the Com-
monwealth’s demand. In Holland you can’t
at present buy the stuff that is made from
stable sweepings for less than about £l2
per ton, and the supply is very short; but
later on it will probably be dumped in again
at from £8 to £lO. Had Protection been
guaranteed plant would no doubt have been
installed in Australia to meet the demand ;
but tariff reform was bluffed off, and now,
the demand for this line being very keen,
the Jap has come in and has been squeezing
as much as £3O per ton out of Australia for
the goods. Apparently in a desperate attempt
to stop this profiteering the Customs De-
partment has suddenly put strawboard on
the list of prohibited imports; but that
merely leaves the boxmakers squealing,
while it gives no assured Protection to
manufacturers. And, anyway, this back-
stairs system of Protection is utterly objec-
tionable.
Egged on by the Age the discontented
Liberals in the Vic. Ministerial corner are
threatening Lawson’s team, and the Govern-
ment, in turn, is cracking the dissolution
whip. The Parliament is barely two years
old. The Bowser party rump is the
most active section, and Peacock, McLeod
and Livingston are candid friends. There are
thus really three parties on the Ministerial
side, and the struggle to keep them together
is fast becoming hopeless. The new methods
of voting aim at knocking out the old two-
party idea ; yet the two-party fiction is pre-
served in the House. The change to elective
Ministries comes slowly ; but that or some-
thing like it is inevitable.
Abbott, Kelly and Orchard have found it
impossible to follow Hughes through an
election, and there are one or two more who
would enjoy the luxury of repudiating
William if they didn’t want the money.
Fowler, member for Perth, has been a par-
ticularly scorching critic, and now he
hints that William would sooner lose Perth
than see him returned. Boyd and Sampson

man who compels them to play privates
when they feel like generals. The Prime
Minister would have great difficulty in get-
ting even the whole Cabinet to present him
with an illuminated address. .V recent cause
of dispute was his tenacious support of
.jensen for Bass ; and feelings have not been
improved in some quarters bv Milieu’s cool-
ness towards the Anzac tweed industry
whereof Hughes has enthusiastically an-
nounced his approval. With those and other
pressing troubles the Cabinet is about as
happy as the rest of the party.

Australia has established none in Papua. Is
it going to be education, or exploitation?

of appropriations to Reserve for War
Taxation and Contingencies.
So far as they relate to the last few years,
the figures shown in the first column need
qualifying. When the Commonwealth Uov-
ernment decided to levy a special tax on war-
time profits this co/s management, or any
other management, did not know how much
it was likely to be called upon to pay. So
all that has been left after the divs. have
been paid has lately been dumped into a
/‘reserve for war taxation and contin-
gencies” ; and these amounts have not been
shown as profits. Yet, judging by the small
extent to which this fund has been tapped
so far, a considerable proportion of these
appropriations could probably be safely
added to the figures in the table. The ex-
pansion of profits, including these amounts
set aside, must further be considered in re-
lation to the growth of capital

Five years ago half of the paid capital of
£400,000 was made up of 6 p.e. prefs.
The whole of the £202,710 of fresh
capital got in since is in 7 p.e. second prefs.
There is the same lot of £200,000 ordin-
aries to share in any surplus after paying
the prefs., and how very well they have done
lately can be gauged by the fact that the
£36,453 (=18.2 p.e.) disclosed as being avail-
able for the ordinaries in 1914 has expanded
to £54,052 (=27 p.e.) for the past year,
though a war-profits tax bite will apparently
have to come out of that latter amount,
and there is Labor talk of a special levy for
war gratuities.
Very clearly Farmer’s have had a great
time during the war. Conditions have suited
the co. very well; so many people have been
deluded into believing that they were better
off that, instead of sales falling away while
the fate of the Commonwealth was being
decided on the battlefields, the stay-at-homes
arrayed themselves in finery, willingly pay-
ing abnormal prices for luxuries which a
war-stricken people could well do without,
and would have done without if the censor-
ship had allowed the true position to be stated.
W. M. Hughes is pacing the continent
telling us now that we have been in a fool’s
paradise, that we have been living on our
capital, and that conditions are equivalent
to a man “drinking his own blood to keep
himself alive.” It is precisely what The
Bulletin struggled to say in practically
every issue for over four years-—and often
had to fight the Censor to do it —while the
same Prime Minister and his following re-
fused to pursue a policy of sane war finance,
and thereby helped to create the fool's
paradise into which the people of the Com-
monwealth have been led. During the first
three years of war only 2s. 2d. in the £ of
the £117,854,847 expended was provided from
revenue; for the two years to June last a
more honest attempt was made, and 4s. 41d.
in the £ was thus paid. Over that whole
period revenue provided only 3s. fid. in the
£ of the actual total expenditure of
£268,446,478; and there are still heavy bills
to meet. Practically the whole of the direct
cost of the war has been charged to loans,
the spending of which has created the arti-
fieial prosperity which has led the people of
the Commonwealth astray. So far only some
of the trimmings of war—pensions, interest,
etc. —have been actually paid for; the cost
of the maintenance of the armies and of the
shot and shell has still to be met, and a huge
interest has to be carried. If W. M. Hughes
had practised what he now preaches, and
from the beginning had made an attempt to
pay a fair proportion of the war costs as we
went along, there would have been less ex-
travagance and less profiteering, and we
would now be facing the troubles ahead with
greater confidence. Of course, cos. like
Farmer’s would not have made such large
profits. But it would not necessarily have
meant that they would ultimately have been
worse off. The bill which was not met
yesterday has to be paid to-morrow, together
with the little bit for accommodation for
having put off the settling-day. Wise
managements, as in this case, have taken
advantage of the abnormal profits and put
something aside for future reference, if re-
quired. The £74,332 war taxation and con-
tingencies reserve in Farmer’s kit may prove
very useful by and bye.
A comparison of the balance-sheet figures
shows (1) the effect of the directors’ policy
of acquiring further freeholds, (2) the out-
lay required on more extensive and dearer
stocks, and (3) the increase of customers’
credits, which is in keeping with the times:

More than one-half of the book value of all
assets is now in premises, and since a fire
obliged the co. by assisting to free it of the
11 years’ lease held by Roberts’s Hotel over
portion of the block, considerable additional
building operations are under weigh which
will necessitate further capital. Compared
with five years ago, the co. has now
£202,710 more capital in the business, but
lias reduced liabilities by £27,515. Mean-
time £239,953 has been added to the book
value of assets, making the balance-sheet im-
provement for the five years £64,758 after
paying 0 and 7 p.c. p.a. to the two lots of
prefs. and giving the ordinaries divs. total-
ling 6<i p.c. But from the accumulation
some deduction will apparently have to be
made to meet war-time profits taxation and
(possibly) special levies.

This brewery moistens the N. S. Wales
northern coalfields —it pumps more beer for
the Newcastle-Maitland-Cessnock districts
than all its big Sydney competitors com-
bined. But, as the dividend column shows,
it has not fattened its shareholders. One of
the co.’s troubles in the past was that it was
afflicted with a very heavy load of goodwill,
apparently no less than £lOO.OOO of its paid
capital of £250,000 being represented by this
froth. In other words, assets supposed to
be worth £150,000 had to earn dividends for
a quarter-million share register. And seeing
that book debts 18 years ago were
half as big again as they are now.
it is doubtful if there were assets
actually worth that £150,000; in fact,
it is probable that for many years trad-
ing surpluses were called upon to make good
old deficiencies. From the table it would ap-
pear that the management had straightened
things out fairly well by 1914; anyhow, con-
siderably improved profits showed up for a
couple of years. Then war troubles dis-
turbed the co.’s chances of maintaining the
better figures. Probably six o’clock closing
did little damage to brewings, particularly
in Newcastle, which has bounded ahead
since the Broken Hill Prop, established its
' steel works. Receipts have expanded rapidly
since 1914; but so have exes.

A big proportion of that expansion in both
lines is clue to the increased excise duty from
3d. per gallon in 1914 to Is. now. Meantime
the price of beer has been increased only by
this 9d. —from Is. 4d. to 2s. Id. per gallon.
The breweries have thus been carrying the
whole of the heavier manufacturing costs,
and what this has meant can be gathered
from a comparison of pre-war and present
prices of brewing commodities. Malt has
moved from ss, 6d. per bushel to Bs. (id.;
sugar, from £lB- per ton to £27 ; hops, from
Is. 3d. per lb. to Is. Sd.; coal, 12s. per ton
to 205.; while the minimum wage has ad-
vanced from £2 14s. to £3 l()s. Since the
beer industry has been under a cloud appa-
rently the breweries have felt timid about in-
creasing prices. However, costs are still
soaring, and something will have to be done
to even things up a little ; and since beer is
a proclaimed “necessary commodity” in N. S.
Wales, an application to the Court for in-
creased prices is not unlikely.
Here is a comparison of the balance-sheet
figures over the past 10 years:—
1909. 1914. 1918. 1919.
Liabilities . . £59,844 £101,744 £102,006 £102,097
Properties, plant.
etc. . . . . 152,362 212,313 219,562 208,847

Stock.. ... 22,029 31,634 50,841 50.915
The feature of that table is the big reduction
in the book value of goodwill; but the im-
provement is not so good as it looks, for
£38,000 of the original £lOO,OOO was swept
away by Writing up assets by that amount
in 1913. During the past six years, however,
an average of £5900 of profits per annum
has gone to reduce the item to £20.000. at
which figure it stands in the balance-sheet
after the current appropriations. Meantime
there has been considerable improvement in
the balance-sheet position, for though liabili-
ties are still very heavy an excess of liabilities
over liquid assets of £18,50.1 lias been con-
verted into a liquid surplus of £17,371 since
1914. This and the replacement of tlie in-
tangible goodwill by something more substan-
tial makes the eo.’s position much sounder
than it used to be. A few months ago the
directors also decided on a change in man-
agement, A. A. Hall, who, having made the
Perth Commercial Travellers’ Club a success,
was brought east by the N. S. Wales bagmen
to establish the lug Sydney club, having been
put in charge. With most of the old troubles
swept away and a rapidly growing industrial
field to cater for. Castiemaine and Wood
Bros.’ chances seem brighter—provided the
whole beer industry is not stung by the pro-
hibition wasp, and that now seems unlikely.

This co. now balances once instead of twice
yearly, so the table above has been recast to
make comparison easier. It is not a talka-
tive concern, and measures up the year’s
operations for shareholders in one line in the
balance-sheet. But even if a full P. and
L. account accompanied the balance-sheet
it would not disclose the interesting informa-
tion as to what quantity of timber was
handled to give .recent profits compared with
the turnover required to produce those of
former days. When the war struck the
construction boom it looked as though this
co._ was going to feel cold, particularly when
a little later the shipping shortage practically
killed export trade. But though the 1917
disclosed profits did sag so that a 6 p.c. div.
was only just earned, things have since
looked up. The shipping scarcity which
impeded the co. in one respect helped it in
another: supplies of imported Oregon, etc.,
were cut off, leaving an opening for Austra-
lian hardwoods. Further, a couple of years
ago the management ran out a tram-line at
Bellinger “to assure a good log supply at
reasonable cost.” and apparently this has
helped. Disclosed profits greatly depend,
however, on valuations of stock, etc..; and as
to that there is no information beyond that
stocks have been “carefully valued.” This
item has grown from £24,02S in 1914 to
£37,965 at present.
Though profits have looked up the div.
rate is kept down. Since 1914 visible re-
serves have grown by over £7OOO, but the
directors have been acquiring further saw-
mill interests, and on account of these in-
vestments and the more expensive stocks
the overdraft has been increased from £5965
to £10,796. Further comparisons can be
got from grouping balance-sheet figures:

There appears to have been hard writing-
down of mill properties; for instance,
though a tram-line was added to the Bel-
linger property, that enterprise now stands
in at £4900 compared with £7500 live years
ago; but, of course, no information is forth-
coming as to the relation between present
book values and actual values. What
is visible is that the surplus of more
or less liquid assets has expanded from
£21,901 in 1914 to £40.322 at the
latest balance, but again this improve-
ment depends on the basis of stock
valuation. The co.’s opportunities for the
future look all right, for. though present
poisonous prices of construction materials
may not be maintained, there are not many
competitors in the business, and they are
a very amicable crowd. True, it is very
easy to be agreeable when you don’t have
to fight your competitor for trade; and
that is the position at present.

“Cassio’s”. remedy for the Commonwealth’s
inflated currency :
The Australian note-issue, according to the latest
available figures, amounted to £55,400.896, and was
backed by a gold reserve of £24,308,413. Politicians
will probably point out with pride that, although
the law requires that a gold reserve of only 25 pro.
must be held, the reserve actually held by the
Treasury amounts to 43.8 p.c. But that is not the
point. What matters is that the issue is now 5J
times larger than it was just prior to the war.
It is impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule
as to how much money is required for the circula-
tion ; exactly the point where the currency is unduly
inflated the writer does not pretend to know. But
this is certain: At present the Australian note-issue
is unduly 1 inflated. There are certain persons such
as bankers (and including, of course, the Governor
of the Commonwealth Bank) whose job it is to
know the needs of the community in the matter of
currency. These people, being merely experts, are
denied any voice in the matter of printing notes.
There are other persons who, through ability to talk
with a greater or less degree of plausibility, .write
M.P. after their names, and to them is entrusted
the management of the most delicate part of national
finance. Now, if the politician were to leave the
note-issue to the person whose job it is to under-
stand the necessities of the national pocket, or, in
other words, if the Australian notes were taken
over, assets and liabilities, by the Commonwealth
Bank,
(1) The Commonwealth would still retain the
monopoly of note-issuing.
(2) Australia would have a note-issue based solely
ou public requirements.
(3) The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank
would take all sorts of good care to have 20s. worth
of assets of a more or less liquid kind against every
£ 1-note that bore his signature.
The Commonwealth Bank has many of the attributes
of the Bank of England, the most important of
these being that it is the Government’s banker, and
that it stores the bulk of the nation's gold. It has
the added prestige, like the Bank of France, of
being the State Bank, and its ultimate reserves are
the resources of a continent. But while the Bank
cf England is a bank of issue (practically the only
one in England), the Commonwealth Bank is denied
the right to issue notes, presumably for no better
reason than that it seems best to entrust the note-
issue to more or less irresponsible politicians.
The Bank of England furnishes a return every
Wednesday to the Board of Trade showing inter alia
the notes issued and the number in circulation. It
is obliged to retain in its vaults £5 worth of gold
for every £ 5-note it issues over £18,450,000, which
trifle it. is allowed to hold in Government debt 11
millions and municipal and other seenril' •« 7 J mil-
lions. According to the last return (he Bank held
in bullion £86,246,000, against which it had issued
notes to the value of £104,696,000. Of these notes
it held as till-money in the general banking depart-
ment £20,290,000, and therefore against the gold
reserve of 86j millions the circulation was only 845
millions.
If the Commonwealth Bank were to take over the
note-issue, the figures/ would look less healthy. It
would, on the July returns, have interest bearing
Government debt £31,098,483, and gold, coin and
bullion £24,308,413 against a total issue of
£55,406,896. Again, according to the abstract dated
September 30, the Bank held only £9,220,762 worth
of Australian notes, and therefore the circulation
(assuming that, the note-issue had remained station-
ary for two months) was £46,186,132, or nearly
double the reserve. If the Bank were to run separate
departments for general banking and for issue, there
is no reason why the Government debt should not
be gradually reduced as regards the issue department
by the banking department investing its profits in
interest-bearing- Government debt until the securities
against which notes were issued had reached a pre-
arranged figure. Anyhow, it is desirable to get the
note-issue as far as possible beyond the reach of the
politician, and the Commonwealth Bank is obviously
the right place.

It is like old times to see the thousands
show up in the profits column again ; and the
crop looks healthier than it used to. The
table takes the eo.’s record back to the time
when 10s. of each £1 share was written off
as lost —£10,500 had only a few years pre-
viously been blindly paid in cash and shares
for the goodwill and appurtenances of a Syd-
ney restaurant in a Phillip-street leasehold.
Not only did the co. have a lot of its capital
represented by froth, but it was also heavily
in debt; when capital was written down to
£7OOO no less than £8297 was owing on deben-
tures and to sundry creditors. Since then
considerable progress has been made in light-
ening the load :

Liquid assets . . .. . . £6308 £8532
Liabilities . . .. . . 8297 3022
Excess liabilities .. .. £1989
Surplus assets . . , . £5510
After paying dividends the liquid surplus
has been improved by an amount practically
equal to the paid capital, and that is good
going for five years. The present position is
that there are surplus liquid assets amount-
ing to 7s. lOd. to represent each 10s. share,
while if the leasehold and plant are worth
their present book value of £4295 there is
a further 6s. Id. per share in these fixed
assets. After their long and anxious wait
original holders are now getting a decent
return on their investment, though £350 of
the latest distribution represents a special
bonus; and, anyhow, the 25 p.c. is equivalent
to only 124 p.c. p.a. on the money they put into
the concern. For the plucky ones who got
in when the market was round about 55., and
have since held on, the recent distributions
have provided a fine little feast, while War
Loan and cash alone more than guarantee
their plunge.

To the Australian Industries Protection
League, W. M. Hughes last week had a lot
to say concerning his beneficial influence on
the metals industry of Australia. In their
ignorance the manufacturers loudly ap-
plauded the little man; wherefore The Bul-
letin is again impelled to examine his ex-
travagant claims and show exactly where
the metals industry of the Commonwealth
has been landed. To begin with the Prime
Minister claimed that for years he had seen
the war with Germany coming. About two
vears before the war, various labor organisa-
tions of N. S. Wales approached the Labor
Government, of which Hughes was a mem-
ber, and amongst other things told it where
our metals, mostly in the raw state, were
going. Facts and figures were marshalled
for the Government’s guidance. But though
Mr. Hughes knew that war with Ger-
many was coming his Government made no
effort whatever to discontinue providing the
enemy with ammunition! The contracts.were
annulled only when Australian metal was
being hurled at us from German guns. It
would be charitable to believe that Mr.
Hughes, as a war prophet, is merely pulling
his own leg.
The Prime Minister proceeded af great
length to say what he had done for the
spelter, lead, copper and steel industries.
Under his guidance he claimed that vast
electrolytic works had been started in Tas-
mania for refining Australian zinc. But
that industry was promoted long before he
knew anything about it, and was made pos-
sible solely by the Tas. Government harness-
ing the Speck’s water power. He further
claims, with great pride, that he has sold
to England for 10 years after the war the
exportable surplus of zinc concentrates.
What benefit that will be to Australian pro-
ducers The Bulletin cannot spe. particu-
larly as the price has been kept a dark
secret. If in future no zinc concentrates
were to be exported, but all refined locally,
the Prime Minister would be doing some-
thing for Australian industry. His further
claim that Australia note possessed the
largest lead-smelting works in the world,
inferentially because of his good work, is
another joke. Australia could make that claim
long before Mr. Hughes saw the war coming.
His claim to distinction because of the
progress of the Australian steel industry,
towards the establishment of which he did
nothing, would be interesting if it were not
remembered that he blocked the Broken Hill
Prop, from proceeding with a shipbuilding
programme at a time when Australia was
urgently needing ships. Even the copper-
manufacturing industry had been established
before the war, but it could not find its feet
because Mr. Hughes and his party would
not protect it with a tariff.
Despite Mr. Hughes's solution of the
metal problem, Australia’s production of
spelter, lead, copper and tin has de-
clined during the war, whilst the figures for
almost every other country have shown in-
creases. The Prime Minister insisted on
handling everything himself, and the result
to-day i.s that we have fewer producers and
smaller production, despite the very high
prices. If each of the metal-producing
Allies had allowed its lead, copper, zinc and
tin production to decline, as happened under
the Hughes regime in Australia, and in addi-
tion had refused its biggest steel manufac-
turers the right to build ships, things would
have gone very badly with us. The whole
trouble with Mr. Hughes was that, armed
with a War Precautions Act, he tried to
run the Commonwealth’s business “on his
own,” and the job was too big for any man,
and especially for a man who had no busi-
ness training whatever.
The Broken Hill strike,' which has hung
up production for just upon six months, is
so nearly crumbling to pieces that Sam
Deed, one of the best-known men in the local
Labor movement and a paid official of long
standing, moved the other day that they cry
off and go back to work. Of course it
wasn’t carried; but Deed wouldn’t, move a
thing like that without knowing that he had'
solid backing.
Oberon is responsible for more shat-
tered hopes than any other district in
N. S. Wales. There is an enormous stretch
of country west and south which is remark-
able for its mineralisation, but with the
exception of Burraga there has not been
a continuously-payable mine, and the only
one at present being worked at a profit is
a bismuth show not far from Oberon. The
district is the home of Tantalus. Min-
erals of all sorts everywhere, but either not
in sufficient quantity or too refractory in
combination to be payable. Mount Werong
is a fair sample of the whole. Inaccessi-
bility is generally advanced as the reason
for the non-working of the many extensive
multi-mineral deposits which exist in this
locality, but intractability is the real reason.
There is no field where the big-hearted,
brawny-armed prospector has been more in
evidence, and none where he has had less
reward. Any suggestion of renewal of
activity in mining always seems to revive
interest in some section of this field. Thus
a strong effort is being made just now to
resuscitate the old Black Bullock show, near
Oberon. As a surface deposit, it produced
a large quantity of gossany ore which was
fairly rich in precious metals, but at a com-
paratively shallow depth it cut out. The
old owners spent several thousands in pros-
pecting deeper ground, without finding any
further ore. Now, on the strength of some
sulphide specimens rich in silver which have
been picked up, a co. is proposed to reopen
the mine. The Mines Department has been
appealed to for help, but the officials are
too wary to be caught napping over a
casual specimen. They plead that they can-
not express an opinion until the mine is
unwatered. The reports which are avail-
able would indicate that even the _ expendi-
ture to do that much would be unjustified.
The price put on the Celebration by option-
holders is stated to be £lOO.OOO in cash and
25,000 shares in what will probably be a
half-million float. In order to justify this
vendors’ bite more development is being
done before placing the show on the market.
Meantime a few thousands are being spent
on Lionel Robinson’s block on the north,
and also on the south block optioned by the
Celebration Junction Co., so as to be ready,
if prospects are good enough, to make deals
with London when the Celebration is dis-
posed of. Except on two or three other
leases no attempt at serious development has
yet been done on the field, though the pros-
pects of some of the Adelaide and Melbourne-
boosted ventures are already discredited.
The Mt. Lyell accounts for the year to
September 30 are not available yet, but from
a few figures given out by the management
the effect of the difficulty of marketing cop-
per is clearly visible. For 1018 the co.
showed, a profit of £247,228 after writing off
£50.307 for depreciation, £18.022 for develop-
ment, and appropriating £60,000 for new
plant and setting aside £64,403 for taxes.
For the past year £130,233 is the best the
co. can show after allowing £49,067
for depreciation, only £85,000 for new
plant, £10,624 for development, and ap-
parently not providing a penny for taxation.
Probably there was no need to make provi-
sion for' taxes, as a year ago £268,000 was in
reserve for this purpose. Owing to realisa-
tion difficulties, shareholders have been with-
out a taste since December last, but they are
to get a 2s. div. next month, which will swal-
low practically the whole of what is alleged
to be this year’s surplus. The recent slip m
the open-cut reduced smelting to one fur-
nace; but the deviation drive is almost com-
pleted. and Sticht will soon be able to build
up his output again.
The Speck lost its veteran Government
Geologist early this week when \Y. H.
Twelvetrees passed out at Launceston after
having surveyed life to just past tile 71st
milestone. Born in Bedfordshire (,Eng.),
he studied geology and mining in Germany.
His first job, at 23, was with the Yoskre-
sensli Copper, South Urals, Russia, where he
also did considerable work in discovering and
identifying prehistoric reptilian remains.
'His next move was to Asia Minor, where he
became g.m. of the Lidjessy silver-lead mines.
He Surveyed the whole region, and did much
pioneer microscopic work. Coming to Tas-
mania in 1891 to seek health, his investiga-
tions into eruptive rocks soon brought him
under scientific notice. In ’99 the Speck
Government appointed him geologist and
chief inspector of mines, and within a few
years what had been an obscure department
proved itself to such an extent that it was
divided iuto two, and Twelvetrees was made
geologist and director of geological survey
In addition to his geological knowledge
Twelvetrees was eminent in petrology and
vertebrate paleontology. The Launceston
Museum was enlarged in order to house the
reference collection of minerals of the geolog-
ical survey, to which he added his own ex-
tensive private collection.
* * * *
Now that silver is booming and Mt. Lyell
is out after the Zeehan smelter, there seems
to be a chance for the little shows round
that field to come again. One of the has-
beens is the Murchison, over which the old
North Lyell-Madden crowd dropped some
cash. It is not far from the North Farrell,
and was given a decent mill to treat the
ore that never matured. A little party of
hardy hill-men recently drove east to see if
the old show would respond to the pick.
Only 10ft. ahead of where the old co. stop-
ped short a nice vein of silver-lead was
cut, and luck stuck to them, for as driving
proceeds the vein is widening. Now cash
is being sought to settle whether the strike
is a squib or a mine.
* * * #
C. W. Gudgeon, for the past six
years g.m. of Bischoff Extended (Tas.),
is Millen’s successor at the Bischoff. The
two properties adjoin, and as conditions are
much the same on both Gudgeon should feel
at home at once. He was formerly chief
surveyor on the old Tasmania mine at
Beaconsfield.
Prices having looked up, osmiridium min-
ing in the Speck is reviving. The Wilson
field, in the Zeehan district, and the Whyte
and Savage River fields, near Waratah, are
again being energetically prospected.
* * * *
At the Ajax North, Daylesford (Vic.), L.
Hansen has got his No. 8 level carrying a
shoot of stone back into the big belt of slates
on which nearly all the best shoots of gold
of the field have been picked up. Most of
the other shows went chasing poor stuff
when down at 800 ft., but Hansen appears to
be on a better wicket. The shoot of stone
pitches the right way, to the south, Han-
sen not only has a face of fully 15fL to
draw on at No. 8, but in rising to No. 7
good grade shows up dirt all the way.
Now he is out to ascertain whether this new
shoot carries overhead. According to the
locals it should ; but, with the Ajax collapse,
there is apparently no such thing as a min-
ing cert, at Daylesford.
* * * *
Walter Eskdale and a number of his
Bendigo pals, including a couple of Lan-
sells, have taken on 750 yards on the strike
of the shoot of silver-lead ore worked at
Indooroopilly, near Brisbane. The Treasury
officials have agreed to a co. of 50,000
shares, 20,000 paids going to the vendors
and the balance being allotted in Bendigo.
Though a shipment of 28i tons ore from the
original claim at Indooroopilly gave 29500 z.
silver and 164 tons lead, the complaint of
the expert in the past has been condensed
iuto the phrase “a gouger’s show.” The
new crowd intends to set out to find the
strength of the shoot by shaft-sinking, which
will soon show -whether the ore is a pocket
or a lens of decent size. At the surface
the shoot has a width of 45ft., and some
of the nodules of ore picked out are rich
in silver.
* * * *
Mt. Cuthbert’s first clean-up after 20 days’
smelting was 248 tons blister from 3897 tons
ore. This pans out at considerably under the
8 p.c. average round which expectations were
built in Powell’s time. Putting electrolytic
at £ll3 and costs at £BO, which is under-
stood to be about Harris’s estimate, fair
profits should show even after making liberal
allowances for returning charges. If Harris
can get the output up to a monthly 400 tons
of blister —a lot of people think him capable
of it—brighter prospects should show up for
the big concern. The floating-off of 70,000
forfeited shares has made finances healthier
than they have been for many a day.
A cry from the North :■ —
The old Charters Towers field is dropping out of
existence as a mining centre, and last month not
a single crushing was returned. It is pitiful; gold-
mining in the North is quite dead. In this winter
of our discontent it is hardly to be expected that
investors will take risks, and this and the fact
that the genus prospector no longer exists make
gold-mining a lost art in the North.

Henry Edward Agincourt Hodges, senior
puisne judge of Vic., who died the other
day, left only £3968 personalty for the bene-
fit of his children. The will is something
of a curiosity. It is witnessed by his asso-
ciate and a judge’s messenger, and is writ-
ten on the back of some typed notes in
connection with the Boveric case.
“Gouger's” judgment comes from Cock-
town :
“19£1” (B. 9/10/’l9), speaking cf splendid sol-
diers a id kindly men, omits to mention one of the
most popular-—Kvrie, of the 2nd L. H. Brigade.
“The Did Brig.,” as we liked to call him, led his
brigade to Gallipoli and right through, Sinai and
Palestine. Ask any 2nd L.H. Digger what he thinks
of “Old Brig.” and you will
get a picture of a good
friend and a first-class
fighting - leader. As for
General Chauvel, he earned
much of the criticism he
is getting. Yet I like to
think of him as the Aus-
tralian general who never
suffered one defeat. For
this I forgive him much.
He led the Desert Column
right through the Sinai
campaign, pushing a hard-
fighting and well-led enemy
right across the Palestine
border, and he won every
battle. And what a battle-
ground ! Over 100 miles of
scorching desert, every
drop of water, every grain
of horse-feed, every biscuit
had to be convoyed some-
how, while our obstinate
enemy was retiring on his
base, and getting nearer
to his supplies. When we
reached Palestine British
generals took over the
army command. I'lieu what
shining up of accoutre-
ments, what saluting
parade s —a n d what
disasters.
J. G. WILSON.
President M.L.
Farmers’ Union.
Peter Mcßride’s chances of getting an ex-
tension of his job as Agent-General have im-
proved considerably since he landed in Mel-
bourne three weeks ago.
Jlist-dead PT. J. Saunders, the Westralian
sporty politician, put up a joke on another
aspiring Senator when both were seeking a
seat at the first Federal election. The two
landed at Coolgardie on the same evening,
but Saunders had secured the only available
hall. As his opponent was arranging to
give an open-air address, Saunders magnani-
mously sent round an invitation to him to
speak from his platform. They tossed for
first speak, and Saunders won. lie told
the audience all he wanted to in a few
minutes. Then the chairman commenced
to introduce the other politician, while
Saunders circulated the magic word "come-
anavadrink.” The congregation, whatever
its ideas were about politics, was quite
unanimous in this matter. It rose as one
man to take part in the big shout. The
chairman conferred with the other candi-
date, and they decided that there was only
one thing to do —go and have one too.
Home again, by the Osterley, Lieut.-
Commander J. K. Davis, who was second
in command of the Australasian Antarctic
Expedition and commanded the Expedition of
1916 which rescued the survivors of Shackle-
ton’s party. When he got back from the
icefields he had a shore job at Pt. Pirie for
a while, and then went off to serve the
Admiralty in the nerve-racking Mediter-
ranean. Before he steered for the south
again he saw “With the Aurora in the
Antarctic” put inside book-covers.
“Lou” tells of the women who talk under
the Red Flag:—
The little Socialist party of Australia has pro-
duced an amazing number of effective women
speakers. The best three —I think the best three
public speakers among all the women of Australia —
are Mrs. Bella Lavender, who lectures for the Vic.
Socialists occasionally; Jean Daley, who used to
organise Mary Ann, and later looked after the
women’s page in the Labor Call ; and Vida Gold-
stein. Adela Pankhurst, notwithstanding her grip of
foreign politics and long platform experience, is not
a good speaker and is too emotional for hard wear.
Kathleen liotson, a South Aus. school teacher, is
lair, but too fast; and
Mrs. Scot Griffiths, a dark-
eyed little American, who
lives in Brisbane and
writes in various Labor
papers and also helps to
push the Labor Girls’ Club,
is good in patches. Mrs.
Lynch and Betsy Mathias,
two Sydney I.W.W. women,
are effective “mob orators.”
Betsy, a frail little revo-
lutionist, and one of the
few I.W.W.’s to stick to
their jfuns after the big
case, edited and managed
the paper Solidarity, and
was for a long time the
two ends and middle of
the Sydney Industrial
Labor party. Mrs. West-
brook, old Monty Miller’s
adopted daughter, is deeply
read, but lacks lung
power. Among them all Mrs.
Lavender carries off the
highest honors. Well edu-
cated, with a good deliv-
ery, she. adds a quick wit
to her splendid equipment.
GEORGE
STEWARD.
Commissioner of
Police, Victoria.
Lieut.-Colonel Sherwood Kelly, Y.C., the
warrior who, since his return to England
from the Bolshevik country, has caused a
stir in official circles by condemning the
British campaign in Russia, has an Austra-
lian wife. He married one of the Greenes
of landra (N.S.W.). Kelly is an old cam-
paigner—he fought in the Boer War, was
alongside the Aussies at Gallipoli, and se-
cured his- Y.C. at Cambrai. When volun-
teers were wanted for the Russian relief
army he was anxious for further trouble,
but soon came to the conclusion that the
expedition as carried out was a mere waste
of men and money.
“McTrochus”: Lately-dead Bili Makireka
(Sir Wm. Macgregor) was a dour supporter
of Exeter Hall in his early days in Fiji and
British New Guinea, for, canny Scot that
he was, he knew the way to a handle to his
name. So he gave an ear and hand to the
multifarious Chadbands who were busy mak-
ing bad Ker-r-rlstians out of good heathens.
Any creed had an enthusiastic supporter in
Mac, and the local missionary hud prece-
dence of the divisional magistrate. The old
Merrie England was at the beck and call of
the missions at any time, and often the
official walked or canoed his way when the
yacht was absent carrying a mission-
ary to Cooktown or Thursday Island.
But Exeter Hall was a good horse
and it carried Mac to the long-wished-
for knighthood; but his heart’s desire,
a baronetcy, never came his way. He
had a hatred for the English public school
boy, and his other pet aversion was sport.
Cricket was in his opinion an immoral affair,
but lie liked a game of whist after a long
day in the jungle. He told me whist re-
quired “brains to play it,” but that was
after I had lost Is. (id. to him one evening.
From a man in the trade:—
Cartoonists view with misgiving the advent of
another possible Prime Minister without a feature to
pin a caricature on. However fanciful in. his
opinions and politics, Tomjo Ryan will never be
arresting in black and white. Nature hasn’t given
him even a redundant wart. It is a sign of the
times that all the really earicaturable identities
are at the bottom of the pack. When I think of
quaint old M’s.P. like Corser of the whiskers, big
and awkward Jim Page, the wfeird and walrusesi
Dicky Foster and the grotesque Archibald, I curse
the commonplaceness which has denied them fame.
On the other hand there is Tudor, who is no more
delightful to the artist than a boiled egg. The
thought of Ryan and Tudor reaching the Treasury
benches together make black-and-whiters thoroughly
miserable: as a mere matter of business they will
strive to keep Billy Hughes in power, partly for his
own sake and partly for the black and brooding
chin of his understudy Watt.
Mephan Ferguson, the just-dead engineer,
got his first big lift in South Aus. llis
water-pipes, now used in every part of the
world, were first employed to convey wate"
to the Semaphore from Adelaide.
T. K. Pater, afterwards S.M. in Adelaide,
was in command at Darwin when it talked
revolution in the late ’eighties. The prickly
old chap called up those who talked about
taking charge and smashing things, and stut-
tered to them that he would swear in every
man in Chinatown as a special constable and
advise the lot to arm themselves with sticks
in case of a scrap. It was a cheeky thing
to threaten; but there was no scrap.
Eric Kendall Bowden, a Parramatta
solicitor, and an ex-M.11.R.. has been
selected by the Machine as National can-
didate for the Nepean (N.S.W.). The
Bowdens’ connection with the district goes
back to 1812, when Thomas Bowden, a
schoolmaster, recommended by Wilberforce,
came to Sydney under engagement as a
teacher. He was put in charge of the male
orphan school at Sydney at a salary of £25
per annum, with quarters, etc. —good pay
then.
So far as clothes could make him so,
Edmund Jowett was the most magnificent
figure that strutted about the lawn on Cup
Day. He moved along as though oblivious of
his surroundings, but seeing everything, even
Mr. Watt, the Federal Treasurer, when he
met him. Jowett, who is ex-president of
Melbourne Club, has thrown in his lot with
the Farmers’ Union, and a leader may be
wanted some day. To have the two main
parties even and both ready to say, with
bated breath and whispering humbleness,
‘Yes, Mr. Jowett” (if Jowett were leader
of a sturdy band of yeomen on the cross-
benches). would make life worth livipg.
Old political hands shudder at Melbourne
City Council election results last week. No
less than three out of four established in-
stitutions were worse than biffed —they were
annihilated. In Latrobe, Shillabeer, who
was lately sacked at Footscray after 20
years jn the local council, lost his place
among' the Fathers, Dr. Kent Hughes win-
ning it by 208 votes. In Hopetoun David-
son suffered severely, final scores being
1 .aborite Devenc'y, 1S05; Howlett, 1177;
Davidson. 790. In Lonsdale H. S. K.
Ward was rejected in favor of Harold Lux-
ton. the deficit amounting to 1116. Luxton,
a son of the late Thomas Luxton, once
mayor of P’ran, is a comparative infant ;
he has a big interest in McEwan’s hard-
ware firm. Cockbill. representing the
beauty and intellect of Bourke, was the
solitary old hand to get back, and his mar-
gin was drily 247 in a poll of 2295.
A. R. Quttrim. M.L.A.. coming down in
the train from Maryborough (Vic.), remarked
to a friend that he was going down to get
in touch with his 64 sons. The friend nodded
understandingly, but another man in the car-
riage, edging up, said : “Excuse me, sir, did
I hear you say you had 64 sons?” Quite
right,” replied A.R. “Married often?”
queried the stranger. “Once.” answered
A.R. The traveller looked thoughtful, and
was persuading himself that he had met a
man with a fixed delusion, when Outtrim
explained. “There are,” said he, “64 mem-
bers. of the Leg. Assembly who call me
‘dad.’ ’’ The Father of the House had been
getting off his latest little joke.
“Gerardy” salutes: —
Brig. Jack Royston, of, Rhodesia, but Australian
at heart, was the most popular leader of Light Horse
in Sinati and Palestine. After helping to clean up
British South-West Africa.,, he asked Birdwood for an
Australian mounted unit. There being one without
a colonel, he was sent to Egypt to the 12th Tj.IL,
which needed re-organising after the Evacua-
tion. Roysthn soon won the confidence of the men,
and his quick action on horseback accounted for the
revival of his old African name, “Galloping Jack."
Pi'ior to Romani he was allotted temporary command
of the Second Brigade. Every desert rider remembers
his fine leadership during the subsequent operations,
in which the Light Horse, by dint of hard fighting
and riding, prevented Abdul from seizing the Canal,
Refusing to operate from field H.Q., he always gal-
loped from flank to flank, shouting encouragement
and giving a lead in many side-issues. Ilis methods
have often been held at fault ; but without him at
Romani the British line could never have held. On
lly lie's return from furlough, Royston succeeded
.?i.till in the command of the Third Brigade, and
accomplished brilliant work. Always on the heels of
the enemy, he kept his regiments in the forefront,
taking pride of place in every movement from Bii'-el-
Abd to the Wadi Ghuzze. After the first reverse at
Gaza lie conducted the strenuous rearguard action
which saved a British division from annihilation. He
disappeared suddenly ; and the only guess the Light
Horse made was that his great popularity affected the
dignity of his superiors in rank. About his popularity
they were right: throughout Sinai and Palestine,
“Galloping Jack” was the only leader cheered to a
man by Australians wherever he went.
EXEMPT.
“ Don't you ever yet fed up with married
life?"
"No, never."
“What the dickens arc you—a saint?"
"No —a bachelor!"
A. K. Wallace, the Labor candidate for
the Albert Park (Vic.) Assembly seat,
vacated by Joe Hannan, who has resigned to
go for the Fawkner Federal seat, has had a
varied career in three States. A carpenter
and joiner, he gravitated to Broken Hill, and
was there associated with R. S. Ross, Tom
Mann and others in the production of Tiie
Flame, which described itseif as “the tongue
of the Revolution.” Later he became secre-
tary of the United Labor party at Adelaide,
where t he fell out with the heads of the
AAV.U. and was dethroned along with the
then president Murphy. Returned to the
Hill with his wife (the fiery talker of Social-
ism in Tom Mann’s early Melbourne days),
he got a job on the railway construction.
After that he was assistant sec. of the Vic.
Socialist Party in Melbourne, and later sec-
retary of the Co-operative Store in South
Melbourne. Years ago (in The Flame) he
wrote an article entitled " v\'hy the Labor
Party Will Not Do.” Evidently with a Par-
liamentary seht in prospect, he reckons he
can put up with it.
A lot of ex-mayors of Adelaide got to-
gether to congratulate Glover, who will hold
the chair for the rest of this month only,
on his right to be called “Lord.” There
were Edwin Smith, Bullock, Cohen, Bony-
thon, Simpson and Willcox, who can claim
among them 20 years of office. Cohen, who
holds the record with seven years, and did
most to get Adelaide the gaudy title, has
declined to have the use of it next year,
and Moulden (who lately married the
Hackett widow of Perth) is pretty certain
to get the vote of the ratepayers, who, in
Adelaide, decide the matter. Glover has
greeted the “honor” in a way which is usual
with him—by giving £5OO for fitting up yet
another children’s playground on the Park
Lands.
Though the National Federation and
A.W.N.L. had poor luck with their soldier
candidate at the recent Corangamite (Vic.)
by-election, another returned man, Allan
McDonald, has been selected for the coming
contest. This time the chosen is a son of
the Western District, having farmed at
Winchelsea for years. McDonald was
wounded at Bullecourt, but later went back
to France and took part in other engage-
ments. He was one of Jacka’s men at Poly-
gon Wood.

NO MAN’S GRAVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“An unknown soldier’s remains are to be taken
fjKun Franee and buried in Westminster Abbey.”
Here, where the kings lie, let him be laid,
For kingly among the kings is he!
Boldly he strode in the great dark shade
\Y here the flying shard and the reeking blade
Clove the path of the years to be!
Let there be surge and pomp of sound,
Rolling music and march of feet!
Dust of victory moulders round,
But none came down to this holy ground
Slain in victory so complete.
Deep in the long grey shadows, dumb,
They that for truth had lived and died
Wake at the sound of the dull death drum,
Glorious out of the dark they come,
Lowly-wise in their splendid pride.
Two and two in their armor bright,
These shall carry the warrior’s pall
Out of the davshine into the night,
For beyond the night is the light of light
And this is the soldier king of all.
Bury him, ye that lived to see
The deed he wrought to its end and fame !
How should a grander burial be
To live in a new world’s memory
Than this of a soldier without a name?
Who shall say that the kings are dust ?
Royal he lives while the faith holds true
That over the crime and the shame and lust
One was -worthy the great world’s trust —
The soldier who fell that no man knew!

MINCHINBURY
The National Council of Women recently
had a field-day in Sydney, and protested
against many things, including the Y-shaped
backs and U-shaped fronts of their sisters;
likewise their short skirts, transparent
stockings and missing sleeves, and their ex-
posed backbones and front bulges. Then,
rather irrelevantly, some ladies broke out
in favor of uniforms for office girls. Prob-
ably if the office girl had to pass a stiff
examination to qualify and then got her
wages raised libeially, she would accept the
idea with joy. Nobody objects to a uniform
if it shows that he (or she) belongs to a
well-paid and specially educated profession
and is out of the ruck. The professional
nurse wouldn’t part with her ’ distinctive
trappings, and disreputable frauds copy
her for base purposes. On the other hand,
the convict .would give his uniform away
to anybody, and it sometimes takes eight
policemen to get him into it, and it isn't
copied.
“Araminta” : The bread-carter who doubles
his weekly wages by placing bets for his
customers (B. 8U/10/T9) isn’t the only
one in his business to “make a bit on the
side.’’ The lad who brings my daily crumb
tells me that a friend of his averages 15s.
a week extra by snaring domestics. 'When-
ever he strikes a likely miss on his rounds
lie weaves a network of bright smiles around
her, picks out a suitable unsuited missus
in another house and asks the latter what
she is prepared _to offer for a “treasure.”
An advance of 5s. a week over what his
prey has been getting brings her along to
the new job. and Bill scores a nice present
from the obliged housewife. Naturally both
parties have to take an oath of utter secrecy,
or Bill would soon become unpopular with
many of his customers.
* * * *
“1041”: “Camelero” (B. 23/10/T9) re-
marks about the bag of ice General Cliauvel
used to get every day while at Talat-el-
Dumrn. He mentions several other Aussie
generals who drank the brackish water of
the Jordan and swel-
tered down in the Valley
instead of chasing the
iced drinks Chauvel
got. But long before
divisional headquarters
moved past Jerusalem
you could buy ice in
Jericho from that
ever-resourceful sec-
tion, the A.I.F. can-
teens, for a few
piastres a block. From
here all the officers’
messes drew their sup-
ply of ice and drinks.
Thousands of Aussies
and Tommies partook
of the iced drinks
sold by the canteen
for a half-piastre a
mug. These and many
more such extras made
the long stay in the
Valley possible. I’d
like to see somebody
give the A.I.F. canteens credit for their
valuable work in this campaign.
“R.S.”: After landing Bill met some
friends and had several. Then he went to
see the people at the barracks in reference
to his missus. “I want the address of my
. wife,” he said. “She was on the wharf
when I landed, but when she saw me
she ducked.” After particulars had been
obtained as to his name, regiment, etc., the
information about his wife was promptly
supplied. “Good-oh! Thanks, Digger,” re-
plied Bill, and proceeded to depart. But
before reaching the door he had a brain
wave. Stopping, he turned on the military
clerk who had supplied him with the infor-
mation. “ ’Ere,” he said suspiciously, “how
the hell do you know my wife’s address?”

“Lex” : The action taken by the employees
of the Manly ferry eo. in declining to fur-
ther abet the carriage of Sabbath pleasure-
seekers, on the ground that it is illegal to
do so under the well-known statute of
Charles 11., is capable of extensive develop-
ments. The statute’s legality has already
been confirmed in the N. S. Wales Courts,
and under it practically every citizen of
Sydney might be convicted. Anyone, for
example, could take out summonses against
all concerned in the printing and publishing
of Sunday newspapers: against the dis-
tributors ; even against those guilty of read-
ing them.- All attendants at surfing sheds,

HIS BAD DAY.
SENTIMENTAL PARTY: "I suppose there are days when you feel lonely, sad and forsaken,
with every door closed against you?"
THE OUTCAST: "Yes, Miss—Sundays, when the piths is shut.”
with persons employed in garages, on
punts, and on trams and trains, in fruit-
shops, restaurants and hotels—all these may
be guilty. Also the morning dailies in
respect of their Monday issues, which are
the outcome of Sunday labor. The point
was tested in Sheffield (Eng.) two or three
years ago by Clement Edwards, M.P.
Ninety-two of his constituents—small
traders in tobacco, sweets and the like—
were proceeded against under Carolus 11.
by a Watch Comhiittee of local wowsers.
Edwards’s riposte was to issue summonses
against the whole of the Watch Committee
for the Sabbath-breaking of which they had
been guilty in the course of their ordinary
avocations. A cleric, for example, was
summoned for having his church magazine
on sale at the door of the tabernacle. The
affair was compromised ultimately by the
withdrawal of all proceeding? on both sides.
Here, as in the Ferries case, the Act will
more probably be used for purposes of polite
blackmail. Any body of Sabbath-day
workers who want raised wages in defiance
of a Court award will merely have to trans-
form themselves into (strictly temporary)
conscientious objectors.

“T. 0.1.” on “silks” and “stuffs”
Fifty years ago Australian barristers were not eager
for “silk,” and many in the front rank refused to
take it. The silk interfered with chamber practice.
In Melbourne T. H. Fellows, one of the ablest of
chamber lawyers, was noted for his refusal to accept
either silk or a judgeship. Finally Chief Justice
Stawell told him in open Court that he ought to
accept a seat on the Bench, then vacant, as his
refusal was keeping junior men in the background.
He accepted, but £5OO had to be added to the salary.
In the ’fifties Fellows had chambers in Temple
Court, and his clerk was an LL.D. One morning he
got the surprise of his life. Chief Justice Stawell
sent for him and in hot indignation told him that it
was disgraceful for him, a barrister, to keep barrels
of beer on tap in his chambers wherewith to regale
his clients. Fellows denied all knowledge of it, and
hurried off to interview his LL.D. clerk, who for
answer invited him into a back room where were
three barrels of “British,” one on tap, with all the
needful drinking appliaocgs. The clerk’s explanation
was that clients invited -Mm constantly to “wet it”
at the nearest hotel—tfffe Waterloo, in Chancery-
lane —and to avoid this he thought it best to keep a
stock on hand. Fellows ordered the barrels to be
removed, and they were, much to the disgust of bar-
risters’ and attorneys’ clerks, who had got the habit
of dropping in and drinking the boss’s health.
* * * *
Flaving combed Australia for a great
lawyer, sound especially on the. Constitu-
tional side, and discovered him in Adrian
Knox, we set him up as Chief Justice of
the Commonwealth; and then we sent him
to Melbourne and for a first case called upon
him to decide whether a certain little sub-
urban store was a ham-and-beef shop or a
grocery. But no Adrian Knox alone could
be trusted to answer an abstruse question
like that; so we gave him the help of Jus-
tices Isaacs, Rich and Duffy. Before that
no less than two Courts had struggled with
the demoralising proposition, and, queerly
enough, they didn’t see any difficulty about
it. First, the local magistrates had said :
“Why, ’am an’ beef, o’ course” ; and Hood, J..
upon being appealed to, said he reckoned it
was a question of fact and not law, and, as
the local beaks could probably distinguish .’am
an’ beef from soap an’ biscuits, they might
have their way. But the new Chief Jus-
tice and two other Judges were not so sure
about that. Did these magistrates know
what was a ham-and beef shop? If a ham-
and-beef shop sold pickles, for instance,
would it be a ham-and-beef shop any longer?
In the weighty words of the Chief: —
Where the evidence established to the satisfaction
of the primary tribunal that a shopkeeper habitually,
in the course of his business, sold a number of
articles usually sold by grocers, it was not reason-
ably open to that tribunal to decide that he was
not a grocer.
It was Duffy, J., who, having the frivolous
feeling of race-time upon him, couldn’t take
the grave matter seriously, and poked fun
at the portentous judgment; at which at
least two of the Judges of the Court frowned
very hard. Still, on the whole, no doubt the
Chief and his two colleagues are right. But
whether their judgment is going to be of
much value is uncertain. For “number” is
so indefinite —how many articles usually sold
by a grocer has the ’am-an’-beef man got to
sell before he is a grocer?

“Sarboz”; In Kermanshah (Persia), dur-
ing the winter of 1917, it was not uncommon
to see a dead beggar stretched out in the
main thoroughfare of the local bazaar, with
some small change donated by passers-by
sprinkled upon him. When sufficient funds
had been contributed to pay funeral exes.,
the local authorities buried the remains. I
remember one unpopular corpse who took
nearly a week to raise the necessary cash.

THE STORY OF ALBERT MUGGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Returned soldiers are pests.” —Affluent Newcastle
( N.S.W .) alderman.
“It’s ‘kick him out, the brute!’”— Kipling.
Alien war broke out young Albert Mugge was slow
to join the fray.
lie did not fear a soldier’s death—it was not Albert’s
way
To shrink from risks, but he possessed a frail and
friendless wife
Who claimed his duties lay at home and not in
foreign strife.
But Nelson Splurge, the alderman, took quite another
view.
“Your conduct is deplorable,” he said to Mugge, “and
few
Will stand the shameful spectacle of you about our
• town
Much longer. Hurry up! Enlist —and earn untold
renown.”
“But what about my job?” cried Mugge. “And what
about my wife?”
“Your job,” said Nelson heartily, “is yours, my lad,
for life.
Nor need you fear for Mrs. Mugge. She will not be
alone.
My family will care for her as though she were our
own.”
So Albert joined the A.1.F., and, shortly, went to
France,
While Nelson Splurge’s son and heir to picture-show
and dance
Escorted Mugge’s distracted wife; a. charitable act
Designed to raise her spirits—which it did, in point
of fact.
In course of time Mugge lost an eye, and, later on,
an arm;
The doctors held that he could do the Hun no further
harm,
And shipped him home, where straight away he tried
to find his wife,
And also the position he had held in civil life.
IF IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO
DARLING.
ME: "Dear, wouldn't you like to execute a
little commission for mother?”
MY HUSBAND: “Yes, darling. But I'd rather
execute your mother for a little com-
mission.”
He found that Albert’s son and heir had struggled all
too well
To keep his father’s pledge. Jane Mugge had fallen
’neath his spell
And both had fled to parts unknown without a sigh
or sob.
So also, incidentally, had Albert’s former job.
He interviewed the alderman who argued with him
thus:
“The war is done; you’ve had your fun —why do
you worry us ?
Think of your Pay! Your brand-new leg! That
eye —and all the rest!
All found by me and mine! Get out t Don’t make
yourself a pest!”
“It’s odd,” mused Mugge, as he retired, “folks never
used to say
Such things when I joined up. In fact, it was the
other way.
I fought—and here I’m called a pest, of decency
bereft!
I tried my hardest to do right—and, datnitall, I'm,
left!”

THE “CHANDLER” —the Pride of the “SIXES.”
Here is the list of Chandler performances in three States —NEW SOU i 1 i
WALES, QUEENSLAND and VlCTORlA—during the last three months.
WE CHALLENGE ANY CAR OF ANY OTHER MAKE TO
SHOW SIMILAR RESULTS.
AUGUST 12-18—TWENTY CHANDLERS (Roadsters, Touring Cars and
Chassis) travel the BSO miles from SYDNEY to BRISBANE, OVERLAND,
and arrive ON SCHEDULE.
OCTOBER 25-27—SEVEN CHANDLERS (Roadsters, Touring Cars and
Chassis) travel the 600 miles from SYDNEY to MELBOURNE, OVER-
LAND, and arrive ON SCHEDULE.
NOTE—In both instances the cars had only just been unpacked and put
straight on the road, without any preparation or dress rehearsal.
OCTOBER 25—A CHANDLER, taken straight from stock, negotiates the
TOOWOOMBA (Q.) TOLL-BAR RANGE, “ON TOP,” in Imin. 45sec.,
beating the record for the official hill-climb, put up on the same hill a
few weeks ago, by no less than 57sec.!
This trio of achievements has come under the PERSONAL OBSERVATION
of Chandler Agents in the three States mentioned. In addition, many letters, expressing
appreciation of the performances of their cars, have been received from delighted
owners of CHANDLERS throughout Australia.
There cannot be any “fluke” or coincidence about such things. There s nothing
else to it but SHEER MERIT.
CHANDLERS ARE “THE GOODS.”
What ONE CHANDLER can do, EACH and EVERY CHANDLER WILL DO.

A Former Minister of the Crown, Mr. R. P. Blundell, late Minister for Industry
and Repatriation in the National Govt., South Australia, writes of Clements Tonic
“CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.,
“National Party of S. Australia.
“Globe Chambers, Adelaide, 21/7/’l9.
“During the early part of last year (1918) I went through a very strenuous campaign, addressing two and three meetings
nightly, besides attending to my duties as Minister of Industry and Repatriation.
“The campaign lasted two or three months, at the end of which time I felt completely fatigued and worked out.
“I had recourse to Clements Tonic, and derived great benefit from it in recuperating my energies.
“Yours respectfully,
This Remarkable Medicine is sold by all Chemists and Stores.
“R. P. BLUNDELL,
“Late Minister Industry and Repatriation,
“South Australia.”
It can be obtained in any part of the Commonwealth and New Zealand.

“The Chemist”: Mrs. Flatt, an old cus-
tomer of mine, had been coming into the shop
for years, buying liver pills and potions for
the rectification of the same organ, having
been told that pains in the shoulder from
which she suffered were due to liver trouble.
A few days ago she was persuaded to con-
sult a good doctor. He assured her that her
trouble was neuritis, insisting that there
was nothing wrong with her liver. She
brought the doctor’s prescription to me, and
L had to explain: “Mrs. Flatt, two of the
drugs in this prescription are very rare now,
and most expensive. This bottle of medi-
cine will cost you six and sixpence.” Mrs.
r latt gasped, and reached for the prescrip-
tion. “Six and six!” she snorted. “Here,
give me something for my liver!”
* * • •
“Billy B.”: I should say that the Digger
standing in the doorway of a Dago pagoda
on Circular Quay was an inch over 6ft. He
had a full hand of prawns, and what were
not there were in his mouth. He watched
the 9.30 a.m. crowds go past with the content
of the Digger whose work has been well done
—a content which no man except a Digger
will ever understand. Presently there came
by an eminent person—a family solicitor, I
should judge. He caught the Digger’s kindly
eye. Billjim touched him affectionately on
the sleeve. “ ’Ave a prawn,” he said; “I
PERFECTLY FRANK ABOUT IT.
"Bid you tell him the truth when he asked
you how old you were?”
"Oh, yes.”
"What did you say?”
“That it was none of his business.”
just got back from where I’ve bin and gotter
few prawns. 'Ave a prawn.” The good
citizen refused the shellfish, but expressed a
desire to shake hands with “one of our boys.”
The Digger shook, prawns and all. Out of
the squash there was one red-gutted thing
left, and, as Father Peter is my witness, an
otherwise immaculate citizen steered up town
wearing it in his buttonhole.
“Don Three” : The best horse-thief I ever
knew' was Bill. The Colonel was as proud of
him as we were, although he didn’t advertise
the fact; but it was solely owing to Bill and
his cobber, Paddy the Nicker, that we were
the best-mounted squadron in the A.I.F.
Paddy would get away with the goods, and
Bill would camouflage them. One day I was
HE GUESSED NEARLY RIGHT.
THE SWEET THING : “No, it’s not my
coming-out frock. I’m out some time.”
THE COARSE BRUTE: “Er— distance, I think
you mean!”
at headquarters when a sergeant and two
troopers from a Yeomanry regiment camped
down the Nile rode over and asked permis-
sion to inspect our lines, as they had reason
to believe a couple of horses, lost the previous
night, were concealed somewhere about. The
Colonel readily assented, and detailed an
orderly to show the visitors around. An
hour later the three perspiring Tommies re-
turned after an unsuccessful hunt. Having
made his report, the sergeant sadly led his
men outside, but a few minutes later returned
like one demented. “What’s the matter
now?” coldlv inquired the Colonel. “Beg yee
pardon, six',” gasped the Tommy, “but the
’orses we come over on ’ave gone now !” And,
by Allah, so they had!
“19 21”: When
“friendly” Bedouins,
the vermin who, be-
fore our arrival, made
a precarious living by
stealing from each
other, sneaked through
the Light Horse lines
and got away with the
leather troughs used
for watering the
horses, we smiled
and chaffed the
sentries who had
heard and seen
nothing unusual.
The skill of the
desert thieves was
admitted and ad-
mired. But when,
after the Battle of
Rafa, news came
that the prowling
devils had dug up our dead and stripped
them, no time was lost. A body of Enzeds
went out and caught the ghouls before they
had time to bury all the loot. No questions
were asked. A nod and a glance between
angry men with a common purpose was
enough. There were no lectures given on
that occasion.
* * # *
“Artist”: He was from Kew, he said,
and he was a nice young fellow, but he
arrived at the Front with very rudimentary
ideas of war, although things had been blow-
ing holes in the Continent for close upon
three years. He said he would have come
sooner only that his guardian had withheld
permission, and he had to wait till he came
of age. He was quite apologetic about it. I
shall never forget the look of him when he
came back into the trench, after his first
excursion into No Man’s Land. He was as
pale as new ivory, and he trembled all over.
He spoke through chattering teeth. “There’s
a dead man out there,” he said, “half-buried.
I saw him. Somebody ought to tell the
Coroner!"
■* * ♦ *
“The Camello”: He had ridden down as
escort to an officer at
an outlying post near
Suez, and, arriving
about 7.30 a.m., felt
like breakfast. He
was rather a swanky
trooper in a khaki
shirt instead of the
usual “g rey b a c k.”
When he made his
way to the canteen
(run by a Tommy )
he was addressed as
“Sir.” That sug-
gested too good an
opportunity to miss,
and he promptly bluf-
fed the canteen ser-
geant into selling him
a dozen bottles of
beer. It being impos-
sible for an officer to
hump his own beer,
he had to send his
batman for it. As
soon as the story
spread amongst the
boys, he was enlisted
to procure further sup-
plies, and as it was
pay-day business was
brisk. At last the
Tommy tumbled, and
the two dinkum offi-
cers of the post heard
about it. They sent
for the Digger and
questioned him. “Oh,
yes, sir,” he said. “The
sergeant did mistake
me for an officer; but
he found out his mis-
take and apologised to me for it.”
George Prendergast, leader of the Vic.
State Labor party, lately called for a return
of the food-adulteration prosecutions for the
past 12 months. In milk-dealing alone the
figures were so ghastly that no self-respect-
ing Government could contemplate them
without immediately getting to work on a
bill providing a gaol-penalty. One firm was
convicted seven times during the 12
months; and the severest penalty imposed was
a fine of £20. Infantile mortality seems to
mean little to Lawson’s Scotch Meenistry.
* * * *
“Dale”: There was a crowd on St. Kilda
Beach, and the blood-and-fire
crusaders were on the war path.
A small group listened to the
nasal voices with poor pretence
of interest. When penitents
were called for, a man sprang
into the ring, and the crowd
became interested. Tearing oif
his hat he gave testimony in
broken English to a list of sins
and crimes which would have
made Moses blush, but drew
people faster than an electric
train. It suddenly became a
“fine” meeting. The “major” ,'n
charge Was ecstatic. Then came
the smash. Pausing in his con-
fession the penitent’s face split
in a grin. “I reckon that’s about
a dollar’s worth,” he said
in an aside with a good Aus-
tralian accent, and strolled out
of the ring. The cobber who
paid the bet reckoned the
well spent, and the “major” had
had his collectors out, so he didn’t mind,
either.
• • * •
By a man in the business :—
“Phthisis” (B. 18/9/’19) is much nearer the truth
with regard to the treatment of tuberculosis of the
lungs than “Ranger” (B. 16/10/’19)). This is
borne out by the success of the training colony at
Papworth, in Cambridgeshire, where they have been
experimenting. In an area of 350 acres there is a
hospital, a sanatorium and a village settlement.
The more advanced cases remain in the hospital,
but a man who becomes fit to work is sent to the
training-colony section, where he sleeps in shelters
provtided in the grounds. Here he learns a trade,
or, if he prefers it, pig- and poultry-farming or
gardening. After six months in this section he
is offered work in the village settlement at standard
wages. The thing that would be hard on the inde-
pendent Diggers is that advanced cases must be
segregated or they will become bacilli distributors,
and, if married, they would certainly infect their
children. So much is definite in an ocean of in-
definiteness. There is no use in blaming general prac-
titioners when bacteriologists and tubercle experts
are uncertain how infection comes about. One
school believes that the disease is highly infectious,
and that one person infects another; the other won’t
have this at all, and says that everybody is in-
fected in early life, but that in some people the
soil is strikingly hostile to the growth of the bacil-
lus, so that they can harbor it without receiving any
hurt. The 8.M.J., the most ably-edited medical
journal in the world, bids us be mighty careful in
dealing with advanced cases of phthisis. In such
the relatives should not be allowed to visit the
Diggers “twice daily,” as those who are respon-
sible for the Randwick (Sydney) Hostel proposal
suggests. The Journal of August 30 last said•
The use of the spitting cup and the special hand-
kerchief has no real value. The patient with de-
finite or advanced tuberculosis of the lungs ought
not to be allowed to associate with children.
In the U.S.A. and Canada segregation of advanced
cases is insisted upon, and punishment is inflicted
if the regulations are broken. The whole subject
wants the attention of the best brains in the Com-
monwealth. Our Diggers must get a square deal.
* » * *
“Norbell”: On a steamer going to Mel-
bourne the other day I was carrying my
wife’s cup of afternoon-tea from the saloon
to the premenade deck, when a lynx-eyed
steward pounced on me and collared the tea-
spoon. He explained that the souvenir habit
had grown so strong among inter-State pas-
sengers that his co. couldn’t afford to run
any risks with the alleged silverware.
“1921”: “Centurion” (B. 30/10/’l9) says
I let my zeal outrun my grasp of facts in
my estimate of General Chauvel, but he does
not traverse mv facts. “Gerardy,” in the
same issue, says my remarks "are stamped
with the seal of truth.” We may let it go
at that, for “Gerardy” must have talked to
hundreds of witnesses, and could not have
been very far away himself. “Centurion”
says Chauvel “attained high command” be-
fore Allenby left France. I always under-
stood that Chauvel’s high command was
given to him by Hughes. His Boer War
experience counts for little or nothing ; that
war was a kindergarten and nothing more.
There were several times the number killed
in one little ghastly failure in Palestine
(hailed by Sydney daily newspapers as a
great victory) than in the whole of the
Boer War in which Chauvel is said to have
distinguished himself. As for Gallipoli, the
"uashing cavalry leader” got no chance to
dash there; and, anyhow, the less said about
generalship on the Peninsula the better.
“Centurion” states that Chauvel “did things
with his Light Horsemen which had hitherto
been considered impossible by French and
British experts.” True ! Possibly the charge
made by the 4th Brigade at Beerslieba was
one of them. To send mounted infantry,
without swords or lances (that is to say,
not armed as cavalry), at the charge, with
the land rising towards the objective, against
trenches occupied by infantry and protected
by barbed-wire entanglements, was madness.
Such a thing was never attempted in France,
THE HIGH COST OF LIVING.
“Do you think your father will consent to
give you away?”
“I’m sure he will. He said he wouldn’t even
ask you for the loan of a fiver.”
and will, I think, never be attempted again
anywhere. I have wondered what Brig.-Gen.
Grant thought when he got the order. Why
did he put himself in front and ride to the
charge, with cane waving in the air? I
guess he knew “someone had blundered,” and
feared that the troopers, knowing it as weil
as he did, might want a leader. It was a
grand sight, but it was madder than Bala-
clava, only there was no Tennyson to cele-
brate it. Looking afterwards at the deserted
trenches I was sure that if Australians had
held them, and had been provided, as the
Turks were, with plenty of machine-guns,
not a man or horse of the 4th Brigade would
have lived. The glory of it is not to Chauvel,
but .to the men and Grant. “Centurion”
admits that Chauvel is faddy about mane
Lungs. No modern general should be a fad-
dist, unless,- like Lord Roberts, his fad is
the care of his men.

“Young Lady, 20, highly connected, wishes intro-
duction Gentleman, under 32 ; must be of high birth.
In strict confidence, view above, correct address.—
Argus Office.’’
Some girls may for a lusty Cave Man yearn,
Who’d give a blow where others give a kis3,
Feeling they could reward him in return
With love from which would spring exotic bliss;
But blokes like this would never be respected
By women who’re refined and well-connected.
Those stern, strong, silent men, with brooding eyes
Whose sombre depths some secret dark conceal,
To well-bred ladies, moved to advertise
For suitors, fail completely to appeal;
Although they may awaken feelings rorty
In bourgeois spinsters, chaste and nearing forty.
Some mercenary women dote on cash,
As vulgar men admire a swelling bust;
But bounders who aspire to “cut a dash’’
Fill well-connected ladies with disgust.
Such cads would smoke cigars without removing
The bands, their vile upbringing plainly proving.
A girl who has been delicately reared
Would have for mate a man of lofty birth.
He may be cleanly shaved or own a beard—
It matters not, his blood will prove his worth;
She’d like one, say, with cousins in the Navy,
Who would not use his knife to eat his gravy.
An application sent by such a one
Most courteous attention would receive,
But note this fact blue-blooded ladies shun
Misguided thoroughbreds who would deceive;
tor high credentials merely cause distress
W lien posted from an incorrect address.

“Coolibah” : Almost any of our commercial
eucalvpt hardwoods make good tool-handles, and
many of our little-known scrub-woods, notably all
the varieties of Flindersia, or crowsash, are equal if
not superior to the imported ash or hickory ; but the
handle par excellence is made from Queensland
spotted-gum. There are two varieties, the common
and the citron-scented. The latter abounds in the
Port Curtis and other Central Q. districts, where it
advertises its presence by the delightful fragrance
of its foliage. I went to the township some time
back to buy a handle for an imported Kelly. The
local profiteer tendered a sample from Wilson's
country—hickory, price 3s. 9d. This was turned
down in favor, of a spotted-gum handle made in
Brisbane for which I was relieved of 2s. It has
been in use since on a post-and-rail splitting job,
and every bushman knows the usage a splitter’s axe-
handle gets, yet I can’t break it. When building
your waggon use spotted-gum for pole or shafts,
narrow-leafed ironbark for naves and spokes, and
blue-gum for felloes.
A TENDER CONSCIENCE.
OLD PEDESTRIAN: “What have I been doing
all this time? Well, I'm working for
a land-agent, now.”
FRIEND: “In that get-up .”
OLD PED: “Yes. Yon see, he has a con-
science, and he won't advertise his
suburban allotments ‘only five minutes
from the tram' till he's seen me do it
in the time. He says as long as I can
do the mile in five I’ve got a steady job.”
“Bouraji”: “McNorth’s” yarn (B.
23/10/’l9) of how a North Queensland abo. found
his way safely from the gaol gates at Rockhampton
to his home in York Peninsula, through tribes of
enemies, recalls the case of Busimai-mai. He was
a highly-respected citizen of the lower Mambare in
the days when Papua was British New Guinea.
Having murdered and eaten some of his neighbors
he was sentenced to a spell in Port Moresby Gaol,
which is on the side of the island most remote from
his home country, and fenced off by a dividing range
whose lowest point is 8000 feet. In between him
and his original address lived dozens of tribes speak-
ing different languages and agreeing only on one
point—that any stranger should be regarded as
Heaven-sent tucker. One day Busi was missing
from Port Moresby; so were three other Mamba
natives. In due course Busi arrived at his village on
the Mamba. He had crossed the Astrolabe range,
come down through Kokoda and what was after-
wards the Yodda field, then through the country
of the Kumusi and Ope tribes —deadly enemies who
knew him well, these last. He never explained what
became of his three friends. As he had the only
weapon in the party, a tomahawk, the fate of his
companions and the source of his rations for the
trip are not beyond guessing at.
* ■* * *
“Adelaide”: South Aus. naturalists are
excited over the dedication, after long and heart-
breaking disappointments, of the western extremity of
Kangaroo Island as a reserve for native animals and
birds. It has been marked on the maps for years,
but has hardly been preserved at all. “Flinders
Chase” is the name agreed on, and, with the total
absence from tire island of all imported pests, it is
hoped that the Australian birds and beasts will
increase and multiply there when extinct on the
mainland, so that it may be a place of pilgrimage
for scientists from all over the world.
* * * *
“Ilagar” : Know any stranger death than
this? A native was spearing fish from a dinghy
off one of the islands up North. Standing on the
thwarts with the spear poised ready to throw as
soon as a fish appeared, he allowed the boat to drift
along the edge of the reef. Spotting a rock-cod
he hurled the weapon, and immediately dived
after it to secure the fish. Not reappearing on the
surface his friends on the beach set out to investi-
gate, and found him dead. The business end of
the spear had gone through the cod and was hard
and fast in the coral, while the other end of the
spear had passed through the man’s eye, and into
hi,s brain, where it remained. His mates informed
me that he had made the mistake of diving after
the spear from the same side of the dinghy from
which he had throw j it—-the correct method being
to dive from the opposite side of the boat and
well away from the spear.
“Murgon”: While stock-riding in the
Northern Territory 1 went off one morning towards
the back of the ran. On the second day out, as I
was riding along the head of
a deep gorge, I heard a beast
bellowing as though in pain,
and came upon four dingoes
struggling with a 12-months-
old calf, which they were try-
ing to pull to the ground. I
got one of them through the
throat, and as the others
bolted for the bottom of the
gorge I managed to kill an-
other one. Riding up the
gorge I came on a cave, and
peering in I was confronted
by two eyes gleaming in the
darkness. 1 fired three shots
at the eyes and there arose a
long-drawn howl of pain. In-
side the cave a gruesome sight
was revealed by the light of
matches. Lying at my feet
were the skeletons of two
blackfellows. One of them
had a tomahawk still in his
hand, and beside the other was
a short spear. In the far
corner of the cave a rifle was
leaning against the wall, and
lying across a heap of bones
was the dingo I had shot. The
bones were those of another
blackfellow. Remembering that
an aboriginal stockman had
disappeared from the station
about two years before and
had never been heard of, I
thought it likely that this was
the man, and on examining
the rifle I found that my sur-
mise was correct. He had
probably seen a dingo enter
the cave, had shot it and
gone in to get its scalp, when
the two myalls surprised him.
One of tnem probably- mortally wounded him, but
before he died he must have shot the two dead.
Through one abo.’s head was a bullet hole, and the
other one had been drilled through the chest.
“Bright”: “Cowboy” (B. 30/10/T9) asks
for a cure for distemper in a dog. First isolate the
dog. Then call in a vet. If a vet. is not obtainable
treat as follows. Procure chloride of potash
2dr., mindererus spirit loz., sweet spirit of
nitre 2dr., tincture of henbane 2dr., water 2}oz.
Dissolve the potash in the water and add the other
things. The dose for a 201 b. pup six months old
is one tablespoonful, in added water-. In cases of
fits, where the head seems affected and there is
partial blindness or twitching, add the following
to the above mixture, but do not alter the dose:
Tincture of aconite, 18 drops; solution of strychnia,
18 drops. Gradually increase the dose of these two

and the extremities and any sores or eruptions on
the body, belly or thighs should be lightly sponged
with warm water containing a little Condy's crystal
or other disinfectant. The patient should be kept
in a warm, dry and well-ventilated place where there
is no draught but plenty of fresh air. Absolute rest
is essential. Use plenty of disinfectant in the place
where you are nursing him. Boil all water intended
for his use. Give him only light and nourishing food.
If he refuses to eat, drench him with liquid food.
Well boiled oatmeal and milk or strong beef tea are
the two best foods. If the pup has got very low
give him a little weak brandy and water followed by
a little chopped raw lean meat. Finally see that
he is kept away from other dogs, as the disease is
very contagious.

“Wart”: The project up North, reported
by “Gouger” (B. 16/10/'l9), to round up the local
aborigines and transport them to an island off the
coast makes me desirous of introducing myself to the
responsible fools with the handle of a pickaxe.
Didn’t the Tasmanian scheme teach its lesson? Be-
tween 1832 and 1835 203 blacks vvere transported
to Flinders Island. In 1836 only 123 were left; two
years later 82 remained; in 1847, when they were
removed to Oyster Bay, only 45 were living. Dr.
Geannerett explained that they died from no par-
ticular disease, but simply despondency. Dr. Barnes,,
in a Parliamentary paper, stated that “More than
one-half died, not from any positive disease, but
of home sickness —a disease which is common to
some Europeans, particularly the Swiss soldiers. They
die from a disease of the stomach which comes on
entirely from a desire to return to their own
country.” The unfortunate abos. used to go up to
the top of a hill behind the Flinders settlement, from
which the mountains of the mainland are visible,
and sit and watch Ben Lomond, while chiding Truca-
nini with having betrayed them to their deaths.
One of them would state that he was going to die,
and he would do it within a few hours. In the
next couple of days two or three of his friends would
1)0 almost sure to follow him into the shadows.
Australia wants no more experiments of this kind,
although if somebody has to be marooned there are
quite a lot of white long-eared meddlers who never
would be missed.
“Kiwi L.”: When I came up to it the
bullock-dray was well bogged, and the conductor
seemed at the end of his resources. Knowing some-
thing of the game I offered to “give ’em a go,” and
he handed me the persuader. I'll confess my tongue
was getting into its stride; but 1 was moving the
outfit, and I hadn’t used the whip on the steers.
After telling me that my remarks were enough to
“bring down the wrath of God,” he snatched the
whip and belted one of the leaders over the head
with the butt-end until the poor beast fell moanin''.
I gave him a couple to go on with, and left him to
what* else was coming in the way of the wrath of the
Almighty.
“Otira”: They take cows very seriously in
Taranaki (M.L.), where one of these quadrupeds
named Somebody’s Fairy recently made a record by
producing 9681 b. of butterfat in 12 months. But
even in Taranaki they draw the line at obituary
verses to dead bull's. The smile that ran round
Egmont when the following lines, from an English
paper, were read aloud at the bails, was louder
than the surf on the Sugar-loaves, though there was
genuine sympathy with Starlight, the deceased, whom
the bard apostrophised :
Sire of countless winners,
King of all thy breed.
Monarch of the Whiteface,
By the world agreed.
Now thy spirit passes
To another sphere.
Wis shall wait a long time
Ere we find thy peer.
In the age-long records
Of this ancient breed,
Mighty bulls have figured,
But you took the lead.
By the songs and grandsons,
And offspring yet unborn,
Fame shall sing the praises of
Thee whom now we mourn.
Moo!

“Black Bonnet” : In naming our native
fruits no one has remembered the wild cherry. Quan-
dongs, so much discussed, are, in this district (Ross-
ville, North Q.), sour and insipid, and not worth
picking up. But the wild cherry! It grows in
bunches, similar to grapes; color runs from green
to white, finally pink; and the fruit has a small
stone and delicious, juicy flesh. It makes splendid
jam and jelly, and a wild-cherry tart with cream is
absolutely it! Then there is the jon-jon and jedoo,
beloved of cassowary and scrub-turkey, and a revela-
tion in the way of delightful flavors. The Davidsonian
plum, whose qualities are well known, grows here in
great profusion, and I would like to mention the
scrub almonds. The blacks revel in them. The
kernel is a perfect almond, of the proper size and
flavor. The zamia nut, spoken of by several Abos.,
is the curse of every owner of cattle from here to
Cooktown. It will destroy a dairy herd. Two white
boys recently tried to prepare it for food after the
recipe of the blacks, grinding, soaking and washing
it. They were poisoned and only recovered after
days of illness.

A LONG-FELT WANT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I met him on the track to-day.
His battered swag he sat upon.
His dreamy look was far away ;
His purple nose resplendent shone;
And when he passed his tongue around
I heard a horrid grating sound.
One thing I noticed that surprised
Me very much—eai h boot he wore
Had in the toe a circle cut,
A hole an inch across or more ;
And at this hole in public view
A large bare toe was peeking through.
I asked him w-hy. He looked at me
With haunted eyes all veined with red.
“It’s my invention, boss,” said he;
“I’m goin’ to have it patented.
You pulls your boots on so, no doubt —
Them holes, they lets the snakes come out!”

“Melos”: In Goliannaland I met a com-
municative hatter. After inquiring about the health
of Henry Parkes and the Marquis of Salisbury, he
became enthusiastic about his “music-box.” “Would
yer like to ’ear ’erf” he asked. Without waiting for
a reply he brought to light a small, dilapidated
phonograph and six records. “We’ll ’ave ‘Gawd Save
the Queen,’ mate.” “The Queen!” I exclaimed, “why,
she’s dead.” “Good Gawd!” he roared, as if in
pain, “you don’t say so. What ’appened ’er?” See-
ing where his heart lay I said, “Well, as far as I
know Elizabeth died of old age.” A smile broke
across the seamed features. “’Lizbeth!” he chort-
led. “Who in ’ell’s talkin’ ’bout ’Lizbeth? It’s good
ol’ Victoria. Yer a million years be’ind th’
times.”
* * * *
“Scala”: “Mulga” asks in a recent
Bulletin why cypress-pine, sleepers were not used in
re-laying the AVestern line (Q.). Here is one
reason. The class of engine (B 15) used to date has
an axle-load of eight tons. When the bridges are
strengthened up to 12 tons axle-load the Cl 6 and
817 engines will run on this section, Chinchilla to
Roma. The type of rail used has a flat bearing sur-
face on the sleeper, no bearing plates being used.
Cypress pine is readily cut, and though with the
small 815 engine satisfactory results are obtained,
yet the bigger engine is too severe. Then again
cypress pine under train action “loosens up” the
dogspikes more readily than the heavier timbers, and
when a pine sleeper is re-bored twice it is apt
to snap. From the economy point of view, let me
point this out. About 1910 a commencement was
made to raise the axle-load of the' bridges on this
section. To date there are still a number to do.
Though this section has been capitalised with the
ALREADY ENLISTED.
“Oh, if you poor fellows would only come
along to our meeting I am sure you
would be converted.”
“Thash orright, m’ dear. We’ve been on a
converted bloomin’ cruiser thish last
four years.”
additional cost, no advantage can be taken of this
money because of the few -outstanding ones. Night
after night mail trains run through with two 815
engines attached, and the load is not enough to
make a 817 engine think seriously. “Mulga” is
quite right, however, about the length of life of the
cypress-pine sleeper, and also the waste of dog-
spikes and fishbolts, all good second-class material.
Still, the spikes are very handy to throw at snakes.
“Chips” ; Take my tip and make your mal-
let of seasoned red-gum. I’ve been shifting mortise-
holes with a persuader made of this timber for 17
years, and beyond having to cut new faces to it
on about its tenth anniversary, it is still meeting
all requirements. Put rings on the chisel-handles
for heavy work, for the gum will soon prove its
superiority over ordinary handles.

FATHER: Don't ask so many questions, my boy. Remember ‘curiosity killed the cat."'

“The Pariah”: If “Penner-up” (B.

when curing his sheepskin mat he may get an even

‘ Cape Pork”: Little is known of the
methods pursued by cattle duffers in the Far North.
Such operations as branding over a wet blanket,
blotching brands and altering earmarks, painting
horses, etc., are considered by the up-to-date cattle-
or horse-thief as the work of novices.
I tumbled on to a very daring ruse
on a station in the vicinity of Coen
some years ago. The owner of a
large run had grown suspicious of the
number of brandings during the previ-
ous year or two, and after careful
investigation it was found that the
adjoining owner had been in the habit
of earmarking 'weaners with his (the
rightful owner’s) pliers, which he had
either “shook” or got made. The
weaners had been then turned bush,
and had not been mustered for brand-
ing, as branding and earmarking in-
variably go together. The duffer had,
after a while, run the weaners in
with his cattle and placed his own
brand on them, at the same time
altering the earmarks. Another
mystery was explained to me by one
of the swiftest rustlers up that way.
A racehorse had disappeared from
the Townsville district and I had
a suspicion that a certain well-bred
horse on one of the Cape stations was
it. The brand appeared to be that
owner’s, and not a trace of faking
could be detected. I learnt, how-
ever, that the trick had been per-
formed by the aid of some thin
copper wire and a small needle, re-.
sembling a packing-needle. The wire had been
threaded around the brand, then drawn tight and
gathered up into a ball which afterwards dropped off,
leaving a scar. Then the thief’s brand had been
placed on and the scar covered so that it was im-
possible to detect the fraud.
* * * *
“Kitty Kitty”: “Jobber’s” mention (B.
9/10/’l9) of King Jimmy Fireaway prompts me to
write of another monarch —Michael, king of the
Cooplacurripa (N.S.W.) tribe. When he stood facing
the dawn he measured 6ft. 3in., and exhibited limbs
of enormous size and power. His skull was extremely
hard, and often, to while away the time, he would
allow strangers to strike his cranium with a stout
stick to show how far the club would bounce
back. Michael worked, at times, stockriding on
Cooplacurripa station, and the late J. K. Mackay,
the owner, decorated him with a brass crescent on
which was engraved: “King Michael, Cooplacurripa.”
“Wai-hoi”: The Dutchmen who struck
Shark’s Bay (W.A.) in 1616 wouldn’t know the land-
scape these days. When they clambered ashore
and left a tin plate at what’s now Cape Inscription,
they reckoned it was the limit in the way of dead
finishes. But to-day Dirk Hartog Island is a fine
sheep-run belonging to Jimmy Nicholas, who bought
Mead out. The crossbred merinos are doing
famously on the low, scrubby feed, and about
30,000 of them passed the hurdles at the last count.
Nicholas is on a good wicket, as neither dingoes
nor rabbits are on his visiting-list. Although there
are no surface waters worth mentioning there are
plenty of wells, the depth of some about 300 ft., that
give a tip-top supply.
“Bill R.”: “F.R.” (B. 23/10/T9) earned
a black mark on his Abo. license when he said
that as a slayer of rabbits the fox is a fraud. When
my tribe goes after foxes we invariably look for
bunny country. That’s where the red stinkpot is
sure to be found. Scraps of rabbit strewn about
the mouth of a burrow always indicate that Mrs. Fox
and the family are within. Finally, I have watched
foxes sneaking to intercept rabbits that had left
the warrens, and an unholy time they give the;
kittens that they succeed in cutting off.
* * * *
“Nick Bottom”: I introduce two more
one-armed men w r ho can hold their own in the
scratch for a living. Billy Sanson, of Williamtown
near Stockton (N.S.W.), is a cocky who does any
old job on the farm, in-
eluding filling his pipe
and helping the missus
pee] the spuds. The only
graft 1 ever saw best him
was washing his arm. Bill
French, of Piccabeen,
Tweed River (N.S.W.), is
general handy-man of the
district. I thought him a
bit of a wonder when I
saw him, single-handed (in
both senses of the word),
fell trees, split slabs,
scantling, etc., and erect
a cottage. The floor was
of slabs so neatly adzed
and fitted into place that
one could hardly tell that
sawn timber hadn’t been
used. When Bil] took me
to his home and showed
me a sideboard which he
had composed, I began to
wonder if it wasn't better to have one arm than
two.

“Eddyson”: When Nat Higgins awoke he
felt something like the morning after, and was
strangely pinched in his bed. Then, coming weakly
out of the haze that surrounded him, he noticed
that his bed had walls a little higher than his head
and very close together, giving a man small room
to turn in. Hearing a peculiar sound Nat Higgins
raised his head, raised it slowly and with difficulty.
There were two tall candles at his feet and two at
his head, and, so far as he could gather, he was
not in his bed at all, but on the parlor table. It
was a queer joke to play on a poor boy in his
sleep, and him not well. His mother was on her
knees at a chair to his left hand, and the noise
he heard was the sound of her keening. Nat lav
back very softly. If he were dead it would very
likely work ill for the old mother should he com-
too suddenly to life again, and with a loud cry, such
being the impulse upon him. He lay a long time
and thought hard, and presently a crowd came troop’-
mg into the room, and he recognised the voice of
old mother Coolahan wailing for him, as he had
heard her wailing for many a strong man. Slowlv
he raised his head, and he peeped again over the ton
of the tall coffin, for such it was indeed. He caught
the eye of Dan Brophy. Dan was standing near ■
Ins hat in his two hands hung before him; his
head was held down with grief and the thought of
the long hour it was since he last tasted the com-
fort of drink. Dan’s eyes slowly widened his nos
trils moved like those of a proud horse, his mouth
took a strange shape of terror, and he backed to
the wall. Other eyes turned to the coffin, and there
was a rustling of dry tongues, and into every face
came the same look of cold horror, and all the
men in black and the women in their crOpe backed
step by step to the wall, leaving the centre of
the loom to the dead man and his poor old mother
on her knees at the chair. Nat Higgins raised a
finger to his lips. “Whist., man,” said he to
Brophy, “I’m not dead!” Brophy licked his lips
with a tongue so dry you heard the scraping of it
and he said never a word, which was curious enough
in Dan Brophy, for Dan was the great politician to
be sure, and it was rare with him to miss the
opportunity of passing some few remarks “I t e ]j
yeh,” whispered Nat, the corner of his eye on his
old mother at her prayers, “I’m not dead at all ”
Then Brophy took one step forward, glanced at the
company, licked his lips again, and, said he in o'
cracked old voice, “Nat Higgins,’’ he said, “vou’re
in a hopeless minority!”

“Wart ’: The first game law in Australia
was one of Collins’s orders, issued soon after his
arrival at the Derwent, regulating the shooting of
the black swan. The birds at that time were in
thousands on the Derwent. When Flinders and Bass
sailed into the Tamar they named Swan Bay and
Swan Point from the numbers in the vicinitv.
Flinders described Swan Point as being compose!
equally of sand and quills. Only a few birds are
left on these rivers now. Something hard ought
to be propelled at the Huns who go each year to
Swansea and shoot 50 to 100 birds a day. At the
“swanning,” as they call it, they catch the birds
in the moulting season, when they are unable to fly.

A.R.W.”: Try this if you want to cure
sheepskins for mats. (Incidentally, I pre f er the
skins green.) Get lib. alum, 4oz. salt, lgal.
water. Make sufficient of the mixture to thoroughly
cover the skins to be treated. Add a few handfuls
of bran, pollard or oatmeal to remove fat (bran
is best). Stir well to mix thoroughly. Allow the
skins to soak for 48 hours, turning occasionallv.
Remove skins from mixture and stretch on frame,
shed floor or wall, nailing to keep in place. With
an old shear blade or similar implement scrape the
skin thoroughly in every direction to remove scraps
of flesh and to break fibres. Repeat daily until skins
are about dry, then remove them from wall, door,
floor or frame, and rub between hands as though

washing clothes. This must be done occasionally
until they are quite dry, when the bran can be
shaken out and the skins will be soft and pliable
and quite ready for use. Furred skins can be
treated in the same way, but in their case 24 hours
is sufficient time to pickle.
A ROMANCE OF THE BORDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There was a maid from Melbourne and she met a
man from Yass.
It was the drought that brought him south with
travelling sheep for grass,
And one fine day he came to Hay and camped, as
drovers do.
He hadn’t been in town an hour before he caught
the ’flu!
There was a maid from Melbourne at tL-e Hay
“Emergency”—
It was the flu that brought her north to join the
V.A.D. —•
And that same night by lantern light (wherein a
magic lies)
The maid from Melbourne gazed into the man from
Yass’s eyes.
There was a maid from Melbourne —but that was
months ago,
And travelling sheep go north again when grass
begins to grow.
An epidemic, like a maiden’s fancy, comes and goes,
And V.A.D.’s go back to town, and —goodness only
knows!

'Grim Fathers, they have had this further
advertisement from Melbourne Age (October
25) :
That Australians know all about Americans is a
deep-rooted delusion. It is one of the fatally taken-
ior-granted thing's. . . .
Yet everyone knows that the genesis of America
lay in a famous exodus from England. The Pilgrim
Fathers forsook English soil rather than suffer Eng-
lish tyranny....
The liberty the Puritans sought for themselves
they offered to others. Their nation was to be a
haven for all who hated tyranny and were weary of
old-world systems. . . .
That sort, of thing isn’t exactly dogmatic—
it is only pupmatic. Leaving out Columbus
and his kind, who really genesissed America,
and sticking to that part of America in
the United States, and leaving out also the
early Spanish settlers in the United States
(for De Soto planted his colony in Florida
SO years before the Mayflowers began to
blossom), and omitting the Dutch and
Swedes in the U.S. itself, English settlement
began in Virginia and not in New England.
It was a lofty aristocratic business.
The ’Grim Fathers didn’t even begin the
settlement of New England—the inevitable
Captain Smith and his crowd were there
first. That family is everywhere; it is
even said there are Smiths in Heaven. Re-
port has it that there were 74 ferocious prigs
and 28 Betsy Prigs, all members of Robin-
son’s ,church, in the Mayflower, so they
weren’t enough to found quite all the United
States. As regards the liberty they offered
to others, Cecil Chesterton sums it up; and
he is only one of many :
For much of the early legislation of the Puritan
colonies one can find no parallel in the history of
European men. Calvinism, that strange, fierce creed
which Wesley so correctlv described as one that gave
Cod the exact functions and attributes of the Devil,
produced even in Europe a sufficiency of madness and
horror, but here was Calvinism cut off from its
European roots and from the reaction and influence
of Christian civilisation. Its records read like
those of a madhouse where religious maniacs have
broken loose and locked up their keepers. We read
of men stoned to death for kissing their wives on
the Sabbath, of lovers pilloried or flogged at the
cart’s tail for kissing each other at all without
license from the deacons, the whole culminating in
a mad panic of wholesale demonism and witch-
burning.
Their furious persecution of all other sects,
especially the Catholics, would have made
the Inquisition look like an afternoon-tea
function if they could only have found more
Catholics to torture. Also they were
the original slavers. Their bigotry lost
Canada to the United States. The French
Canadians had no love for their British con-
querors, but they stated with unobtrusive
frankness that they wouldn’t fry in the
same Sheol with the Mayflower kind of folk.
In the early days the Roman Catholic colony
of Maryland was the only one which granted
absolute religious freedom, but in time
Maryland was overwhelmed by the Calvin-
ists and Roman Catholicism made punish-
able by death. It survived, however, and
it was the imperative demand of the Mary-
land Catholics which caused the Constitu-
tion-makers of Washington’s day to declare
for religious freedom. The May-blossoms
loathed the idea. When the witch-fury
was at its worst it almost looked as
if the settlement might die out for lack of
sufficient unhanged or unburnt or only
moderately burnt females to reproduce the
species. Of the Pilgrims it might be said:
They were neither man nor woman,
They were neither beast nor human.
They were blanky ghouls.
That isn’t exactly Edgar Allan Poe, but it
is true, and it is better to be true than
Poe.
SOLOMON MALAPROP.
Reading
“Alan B.” (B. 9/10/’l9) is wrong in his
premises. He says that a reader “devour-
ing Charles Garvice. ... presently—he or his
son—will devour John Galsworthy. It is
inevitable.” Wherefore it "hardly matters
what people read, the important fact being
that they are reading.” It is my ex-
perience, extending over many years of
observation —and it has been my business to
observe and to endeavor to foster a taste
for good reading—that if parents read the
Charles Garvice book in quantity, they do
not read anything else, and also do not
encourage their children to read at all.
Appetite grows by what it feeds on, and that
is as true of the reading habit as of the
drinking or gambling habit, or the picture
habit. A Charles Garvice reader (meaning
this author as a type) will seldom, if ever,
rise to Scott, while Masefield is a sealed
book. Make systematic inquiries at the
lending libraries, and you will find that tin*
same readers take the same type of book
practically always; some, of course, indulge
in promiscuous reading, until, in maturer
years, they settle in their chosen groove.
The sex-problem novel reader is ever on the
alert for new sensations, and will return a
book unfinished if it has not the necessary
ginger.
Like “Biologist.” I do blame our system
of compulsory schooling for a lot of this
deplorable taste. The prescribed course
merely makes pupils more or less conver-
sant with elementary words and phrases, an j
can have no well-founded hope of making
them students of classics. In some cases
the seeds may fall on good ground. But if
the home does not provide the foundation
of reading taste, it will very rarely exist.
Following that up, the widespread taste for
neurotic reading, especially in flapperdom,
seems to reflect upon the home. It is a
“sign of the times.” like the craze for jaz-
zing and the Bolshevik’s free love.
IDA D.
A Satchel of Books
Uncle Abner, Master of Mysteries, by M. D. Post
(Appleton, New York). A set of 18 detective stories.
They have two qualities which lift them above most
yarns of their kind —-plausibility and excellent charac-
terisation. Uncle Abner is a hard-bitten old Virginian
with the gift of observation, and is a very welcome
change from the usual society sleuth. Also, he has
no use for the scientific equipment of the conven-
tional detective, and altogether is refreshing after
the impossibilities of the average U.S.A. photoplay
hero.
According to Orders, by F. Britten Austin (Mel-
rose, London). Ten virile war stories, nine of them
from a German viewpoint. The third one, “The
Terror in the Sky,” is a thrilling account of a
Zep. raid on London, and “The Spy” is a variation
on the Bolo Pasha theme. If any one yarn stands
out above the general excellence, of the collection
it is “The Plateau of Thirst”—the story of an
Italian attack on the Austrian trenches: the de-
scription of the attack and subsequent isolation of a
decimated company between the Austrian barrage
and a poisoned well is finely done. There was a
certain stiffness in “Battlewrack,” published two
years ago. According to Orders is a great improve-
ment.
The Volley of Headstrong Men, bv J. S. Fletcher
(Hodder and Stoughton, London). This is a tale of
manufacturing England, with a powerful, autocratic
Yorkshire man as the central figure. He treads with
a heavy boot on everything in the way of opposition
to his will and spends great sums of money on his
own ambitions and desires until the crisis of self-
humiliation arrives. The plot is a bit too melo-
dramatic, but the book is rather well written.
The Mystery of the Hills, by Ruby M. Doyle
(Penfold and Co., Sydney). There is excellent local
color in some chapters of this book and tfie de-
scriptions of the wine country of South Australia
are fresh and new, but the author has an unfor-
tunate habit of talking about birds as “feathered
denizens of the forest” and using other dull tricks
of the journalist. The plot is conventional and the
characters lack novelty; but there is more than a
hint of promise in the book.
An English Vision of Empire, by Frederic Wynne
Phillips (Australasian Authors’ Agency, Melbourne).
A booklet of dull, more or less conventional verse
without anr' hint of poetry. Here is a sample:—
“One peep into the casement drawn
To touch those magic keys!
To mingle with the thoughts there born
And view with him the quickening dawn
Of British’ Colonies !”
And yet some hold that the British Empire is not
responsible for atrocities!
At All Costs, by V. Ambrose Cull (Australasian
Authors’ Agency). A war book of very special
interest written by a man who paid as high a cpst
as was humanly possible without actual loss of life.
It is well written, too, and states in simple, direct
language the facts about certain phases of the war
which Australians have not dealt with largely. The
author rendered splendid service as a scout or spv.
He crept through the terrors of No Mail’s Land, arid
he brought in the information that made for success
and saved thousands of lives. A valuable man and
a good book.
Lamps and Vine Leaves, an anthology by three
hands (Australasian Authors’ Agency, Melbourne).
This is a collection of verse by Charles Rischbierh
Jury, Vernon Frank Knowles and (take a long breath)
Edward James Ranembe Morgan. All the autho.s
are very young men; and most of the work in the
volume is full of crudity and untamed extravagance
of expression; but there is a very fine promise in
all of them. The feeling for words, the sense of
rhythm, the faith in form —these are the very founda-
tions of the verseman’s craft; and all these budding
S. Australian poets are on the right road. How far
they •will go will depend upon whether they ki ep
right on and strive for self-expression or turn aside
to gather eheap and illusive flowers by the wayside.
Some of those wayside flowers are poisonous.
When Women Know How, by A. M. Elias (Nisbet,
London). A rattling good book ou the woman
question' by an author who can weigh things fairly
and is not hysterical nor even over-sanguine about
feminist possibilities. Woman is dealt with in
her relation to all the productive occupations;
and there is penetrating first-hand observation as
well as wisdom and wit. A good strong book,
admirably written.
What is the Kingdom of Heaven? by A. Glutton-
Brock (Methuen, London). A thin shower of wordy
rhetoric with a shadowy rainbow of logic under
the splash. A well-meant book that is not likely
to hurry up the Kingdom of Heaven to any remark-
abL; extent.
The Handmaiden of the Navy, by G. S. Doorly
(Williams and Norgate, London). A book of Bul-
letin and other yarns connected with the services
of the mercantile marine during the war. There is
fine observation here and good color, and the reader
is always close up to the lurking submarine and the
bridge where the biting spray flies through the inky
darkness. Captain Doorly, whose peace-time head-
quarters are in Dunedin, knows, because he was
there; and he has the ability to take his reader with
hint.
Our Atlantic Attempt, by H. G. Hawker and Iv.
Mackenzie Grieve (Methuen, London). A plain
record of the first fine effort to cross the Atlantic.
The detail's of the adventure are fully given, and
there are a number of photographs. The small
amount of actual yarn is eked out by several intro-
ductions and prefaces. While of small literary value
the book has historical, importance.
The Inky Way
From Vancouver: —•
J. H. Curie, who wrote “The Shadow Show,” went
up to have a look at the mines around Prince
Rupert, in British Columbia, soon after the Niagara
gangway was down. From there he will make for
New York, and by Christmas time he hopes to have
copies of his new travel book ready for his friends,
and, incidentally, the public. It ought to be a
great book, as it covers most parts of the world.
As an appraiser Curie has looked at over 500 mines
in about 30 countries, many of them obscure.
,T. Lyng, an old Bulletin contributor who
went North as interpreter to Admiral Patey
when the Fleet set out to put a new flag on
the German Pacific possessions, and after-
wards was official interpreter, editor of the
Government Gazette and other things in
German New Guinea, has written “Our
New Possession.” and he ought to have the
material for an interesting book. It will be
published in a few weeks. Lyng was an offi-
cer in the Danish army before he came to
these parts.
A note from “Dr. Nil” :
It is a curious coincidence that while I was read-
ing a story in an old Weekly Scotsman I put the
paper down and commenced to read the Red Page
(B. 23/10/’l9). The story was “The Porch House,”
by Mabel Guiller-Coucli. The Red Page headed its
second column with a poem by L. Patricia Francis,
aged 13, entitled “To An Enthusiast.” It appears
that the authoress is the daughter and the' grand-
daughter of verse-makers of merit. So much for
heredity. The story in the Scotsman is the pifflest
of piffle. Yet the name of the writer of the story
can only indicate that she is a daughter (or other
relation) of Sir A. Guiller-Couch referred to in
the same column! What a contrast! It reminds
me of two famous sky pilots in Scotland. One
was a “Papist,” the other a “Wee Free.” They used
to preach at one another on alternate Sundays.
Great friends, all the same. At last they met in the
street and Mr. Macintosh said: “Look here, Father
Charles, just tell me, now, what’s the difference
between the mother of Christ and—and —weel —say,
my mother!” Father Charles took snuff and said:
“A —weel, perhaps there was no sae muckle deefer-
ence atween the mithers. But there’s a gae deefer-
ence atween the sons.”

“U.P.”: The talked-of “speedy erection”
of a concrete house at Matraville (N.S.W.)
was loitering on the job compared with re-
cent performances in South Aus. S. B.
Marchant has a patent process for building
one-piece “poured-in” houses. In 1914 he
erected a five-roomed villa at Balaklava
in 96 hours. Since then lie completed the
walls of a six-roomed house at Norwood in
five hours 25 minutes, 90 tons of concrete
being used. Marchant recently made an
offer to the State Bank to erect 1000 houses
under the Bank’s repatriation scheme at the
rate of 20 a week, and train returned soldiers
in the work. He is now in communication
with the Federal Housing Commission with
a view to undertaking big work for the Repat.

The recent strike of bakers in Sydney,
though it led the men nowhere except to a
series of bad half-hours with the landlord
and the grocer, hasn’t discouraged the Mel-
bourne men in their quest for more light
on their toil. Day-baking is to be demanded
once more by the Melbourne hands, with the
threat of a strike to back their request. If
they succeed, it won’t be the first time they
have got day-baking. Employers are quite
as ready for it as the operatives; but most
housewives whose husbands are not bakery-
hands have hitherto refused to take the pre-
vious day’s bread. The Labor dog just kept
on wagging its tail as usual, quite regard-
less of the tail’s rights or wrongs. The
newest idea is to pass a bill to prohibit night
baking; and Parliament will think hard be-
fore it chances that.
* * * *
“Zanthus”: It is doubtful whether any
tree previously cut in Australia yielded as
much in hard cash as a Queensland kauri
logged lately at Kin Kin. near Cooran (Q.).
It was sold to the Brisbane Three-Ply Co.
on trucks for £2OO. A dozen years ago it
was offered for £6 on the stump, with no
takers; and not long before that trees of
the same kind were being destroyed to get
them out of the way of the selectors.
“P.”: The ferocious stamp-merchant is
getting his “cut,” too. When in 1917 11.
L. White, of Scone, presented his collection
of N. S. Wales postage-stamps to the Mit-
chell Library it was valued, on the basis
of English price-catalogues, at £15,000.
Now, according to a 1919 English catalogue,
it is worth nearly £5OOO more. The .value
of the postally-cancelled copies of the first
issues—-“ Sydney Views” (laureated head
and diademed head, up to 1865) —has in-
creased by nearly £2500. One “Sydney
view” jumped £4 10s. No doubt it’s all owing
to the high cost of the raw materials, as the
tailor pleads.
* * * *
“Hamer”: Even the Leg. Council had to
take notice lately of the struggle that hap-
pens during every holiday season to get rooms
at hotels in Sydney. But the one thing that
the police might do but don’t wasn’t so much
as mentioned. Every hotel is supposed to
have a certain minimum number ;of
rooms; but practically no steps are
taken to see that they are available
for people who need them. The bung
with a good bar trade doesn’t want to
be bothered with the other side of the busi-
ness, and the police don’t appear to regard
their evasion of a duty as serious. The man
who. will go away for his meals can obtain a
lodging in some pubs more cheaply than he
could get an inferior room in Woolloomooloo;
but in most of the drinking shops the publi-
cans do not even let the rooms, but bluff
people looking for accommodation with the
yarn that the house is full. One of these -
“full” houses which was turning Show visi-
tors away had a small fire on a Sunday, and
the brigade had to wait at the door be-
cause there was nobody in the hotel to open
it.
* * * »
“Weyba”: I suppose I'm helping Webster
to his post-office triumph, but I find it very
wearing. When I lived further out I got
a mail delivery daily. Recently I moved
into a populous outer suburb, half an hour
by rail from Sydney. My house is only six
minutes’ walk from the station, yet the post-
man calls only three times a week—Tues-
days, Thursdays and Saturdays. I believe
even I could make a profit out of selling
sugar if the Government would give me a
monopoly and let me reckon Boz. to the lb.
* * * *
“Kyon”: Score it up to our credit. All
the ships built in Japan to the order of the
British Government during the war were
fitted with Australian-made wireless gear
and operated by Australians. Amalgamated
Wireless sent up a highly-trained staff to fit
and operate these ships. Some of the ex-
perts haven’t returned yet. You see, Japan
is a shipbuilding country all the time, while
Australia only does it occasionally.
THE JAPANESE SHOP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the Japanese shop the little people
Move with quaint gesture and with dove-bright eyes.
The air is murmurous with soft padding footsteps,
And musical with suave, polite replies.
Great bales of crepe litter shelf and counter,
Printed in myriad colors, gaudy bright;
Fringed scarves are here, and patterned silk kimonos,
With cherry bloom or grave storks poised for flight.
But, in a corner, not for constant showing,
Stand in their serried rows strange shrouded
things—■
Rich bronze, gold lacquer, with some rare cloisonne,
Jade buckles, and a tray of inwrought rings.
Here is a sword as when a warrior grasped it;
With carven hilt and burnished blade it lies;
Just for a space its rapier-like reflection
Shines from the little people’s dove-bright eyes.
Just for a space—veiled in an instant’s passing;
The flute-like voices from the silence start.
A tawdry shop of cheap and colored fancies, *
Whose heart enshrouds the flame of war and art.

Suction Oas Engine
is one of the most reliable and satisfactory engines ever produced,
AND WHEN COMBINED WITH
The Patented <CRapici) Gas Producer, illustrated below,
THE LOW COST OF OPERATING IS MARVELLOUS.
The gas is produced from charcoal and water at one-tenth the cost of petrol.
The Cooper Suction Gas Plants fill a long standing, world-wide need. Their first cost is so reasonable and the operating cost so
low that they are placed within the reach of any man who requires power for pumping water or for any other work about the farm.

a
vSudtion Gas Engines and C RapicD Gas Producers
can be supplied in any size from 2 b.p. up.
It has long been acknowledged that a Suction Gas Engine, deriving its motive power from charcoal or similar products, was THE
solution to the rapidly increasing cost of fuel, but, unfortunately, in the past such plants have been confined almost wholly to large
corporations or public institutions. They were not practical when made in small sizes, and the outlay necessary to purchase large
plants was beyond the average consumer’s pocket.
The Cooper Suction Gas Engine with the Patented “Rapid” Gas Producer works with the same ease and efficiency on a 2-h.p. Engine
as it does on a 1 00-h.p. size, and the Plant can be purchased at a cost within the means of any man who requires power for any purpose.
THE COOPER SUCTION GAS ENGINE is the result of more than a quarter of a century’s experience in manufacturing and
distributing engines throughout the world. Cooper Engines are known throughout the length and breadth of Australia for their
good, substantial construction, ease of operation, and long life. Their sterling quality of construction and efficiency has created
a demand and an output which enables us to produce and deliver an engine to you at a price at least 25 per cent, less than
any other engine of the same quality and construction.
The Cooper Suction Gas Engine is fitted with the latest quick-start oscillating Magneto, the cylinders are lined with special, close-
grained, grey iron linings, all bearings ami movable parts are made of the finest material, accurately fitted and scientifically hardened.
THE “RAPID” GAS PRODUCER (Phillips Patent No. 848 ) contains several unique features which have been fully covered by
patents in every country on the globe, it can be started up from cold and set in complete operation in less than 1 0 minutes, and
its capacity for producing gas quickly ami in enormous quantities has proved a marvel to engineers who have made a life-study
of Gas Producers. It not only produces a rapid volume of gas, but a product of very high quality, free from dust or residue
of any kind. There is no fouling of the spark-plugs or valves, and as no carburetter is necessary it is impossible to flood or
choke the engine when starting, as occurs with petrol or kerosene engines. There is no danger from explosion or fire. The
outfit is safe, reliable and fool-proof.
Several clients have written us that, after most exhaustive tests, even with the 3-h.p. Cooper Suction Gas Engine and this
“Rapid” Gas Producer, they have found the saving in cost of operation about one-tenth the cost of operating on petrol
or kerosene.
IF YOU HAVE IN MIND PUMPING WATER FOR IRRIGATION, WATERING STOCK,
DOMESTIC USE OR OTHER PURPOSES, whether your requirements be large or small,
the COOPER SUCTION GAS ENGINE WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR YOU.
It is equally attractive for any other purposes where engine-power is required.
Write to-day, advising the work you have to do, and let us send you price and full particulars of an outfit to suit your requirements.

“Costs”: A Sydney magistrate found him-
self up against a new one the other day.
Defendant said that he had written to plain-
tiff, but his letter had been Webstered.
Of course, the magistrate pretended that he
didn’t know, and made the witness explain
that what he meant was that it had been
lost.
“Lagarta”: Those Queensland towns
which have planted jacarandas and silky
oaks freely are now a glorious study in
purple and gold. If there ..is a more mar-
vellously rich and deep blue-purple than that
of a jacaranda in full bloom, it would take
a lot of finding. One of the Scottish agri-
cultural missioners who visited Australia
some years ago asked why Australians did
not plant more jacarandas in the warmer
regions, and declared there was nothing so
beautiful on earth.
“Digger”: In the gardens of the Tuileries
in Paris, on the side that borders the Seine,
orchestral concerts are held in the open air
on a stage built for the purpose. Chairs
are set in a semi-circle, under a canopy of
trees, the lower boughs lopped off and the
higher ones trained to form a natural roof.
For the equivalent of Is. 4d. in our money
you get the best of music and a comfortable
seat. Won’t our municipal people have a
talk with the Government about it? Maybe
in Sydney the State Orchestra would give
itself an airing now and then.
Considering the languid interest taken in
politics of late years by Hugh Mahon while
Labor M.H.R. for Kalgoorlie, he was lucky
in again getting the Labor nomination.
Mahon had latterly refrained entirely from
exciting himself over any happening in the
Reps., and during the portion of his career
immediately preceding his defeat he had been
as self-effacing as a shoaled flounder. Per-
haps Labor feels discouraged by its experi-
ments with “new blood” in other industrial
centres, and feels that its old reliables are
best, even though they no longer boil up into
a daily fury as a matter of duty to their
constituents.
“Economist” : Leaders shouting loudly for
more production should shriek at least as
loudly for the extermination of social para-
sites." If it is a national loss to reduce work-
ing hours from eight to six, how much more
serious, in an economic sense, is the exist-
ence of a vast horde with no working hours
at all! Take Pitt-street, a hive of offices,
holding from nine till four a multitude of
well-fed, dressed and housed people: law-
yers ; land, indent and commission agents;
share-brokers; money-lenders and book-
makers^ —if some fatality were to strike, say,
90 per cent, of them dead, and they were
not replaced, the balance of the community
would all be better off. If Billy Hughes :s
in earnest let him lead a mission to city
offices and private bars preaching the gospel
of work —blood-making, not blood-sucking,
work. If the parasites were taxed till hard
graft became a necessity, we could face our
awful debt more cheerfully.
“Henry Horsecollar” his scheme: —
My idea is that the railways of Western N. S.
Wales and Queensland must yet be run by wind-
power. Rates have already been put up in quick
succession, and on a very large scale, yet the returns
show that every £1 of new revenue is costing nearly
30s. in new expenses, so that things are worse than
they were. In the far-out places it isn’t merely the
cost of the coal in the engine that counts —it is
also the coal burned in hauling the coal to the place
where the coal begins to be officially burned. Also
over a very great area even water to boil into
steam is rare. But wind is as cheap and plentiful
on the plains as anywhere else —in fact, it is extra-
plentiful because they are plains. Tunnels are un-
known. Cuttings are as rare as honest hypocrites.
And when there is a grade it is seldom worse than
that which a ship faces when climbing the gable of
a rising tide. On these great breezy spaces it seems
to me that a light train —it would be light having
no bulky locomotive and tender to encumber it —-
with a schooner-rig and managed by ancient mari-
ners, who are much cheaper than engineers, might do
marvels for goods traffic. The sea-clipper, well-
handled, has put up wonderful records in com-
petition with steamers (60 days from London to Mel-
bourne is on record), and its cheapness is notorious.
Yet it has to burden itself on long voyages with
extraordinary quantities of food and water in pro-
portion to the number'of people carried; with coal
for cooking; and with spare spars for repairs. The
wind-train, being able to pick up supplies as it
went along, would have a bigger pull over its
steam-brother than the sailing-ship has over its
boiling competitor. There can never be a great net-
work of steam railways across the plains, for when
the last 100-mile stretch has to be started with fuel
that has already been brought 10 times further as
mere luggage, eating itself up all the way, the
final bag of it must be costly. On the other hand,
if we went in for sailing trains, the last bag of
wind on a long run would cost no more than the
first, and the deposit never runs out. The idea
might be varied by the establishment of windmills
along the route to generate electricity for a fast
express service or for relief work in dead calms, but for
goods or slow passenger traffic over three-fourths of
Australia I hold that the schooner-rigged train would
serve. Seeing that coal trains would be eliminated
and all the rolling-stock would be available for pay-
able freight, the same number of trucks should carry
the traffic even though they might take twice as
long on the journey. There would be double lines
far apart so that passing ships wouldn’t bump-—in
fact, they might be very far apart if thereby a more
favorable wind might be expected for back loading.
With favoring conditions and good landsmanship
some astonishing runs might be put up where
stations were far apart and stoppages few. I can’t
imagine anything more inspiriting than a train of
20 trucks, schooner-rigged (though perhaps the front
one might be a barquentine), putting up a record
on the great immensity of things, with a fresh
summer gale behind, a cloudless sky above and the
rising sun and a terrified kangaroo in front. Or,
again, when loading was scarce one might see a
solitary lateen-rigged truck doing a run on its own,
whereas the helpless truck of the present pattern
couldn’t be sent out with a single load, for it
couldn’t afford a loco, and tender all to itself.
Lastly, a train might dissolve into eight parts at a
junction and go its eight several ways without wait-

mobility, novelty and romance—they are all there.
Also, when the skipper put on all sail to keep
ahead of a dust-storm there might be heroism. But
it is the economy question which will bring the
wind-train to pass Where wind is the only local
fuel we must learn to use it.

Eig'ht big; reasons why the Morris 2240
Triple-Geared Pulley BlocK is superior.
1. The “2240” Triple-geared Pulley
Block is so called to emphasise
the importance of its Full British
Ton Capacity (22401 b.) by
comparison with the American
Ton rating of 20001 b.
2. The “2240” Pulley Block is
tested to 50 per cent, above rated
load, which really means that
the “2240” has a capacity of
33601 b. per ton —an enormous
safety factor in the event of
over-loading.
3. The “2240” Pulley Block is the
result of over 30 years of experi-
ence in the production of high-
grade lifting tackle. The Triple-
gearing means a minimum of
effort for the operator.
4. All Gears are machine cut from
the solid. All Plates are solid
forged steel.
V
5. More compact, and takes up less
head room than other blocks,
because of the high quality and
solidity of every part.
6. Every section of the **2240 Block
is produced to such extreme
limits of accuracy that, should
spare parts be required, they fit
into their allotted place with the
precision of parts in a watch.
7 In place of ordinary machine-
’ made chain, the “2240” Pulley
Block is equipped with special
chain, made from trebly-refined
iron by picked workmen, and
tested under strict supervision.
As the load strain falls mainly
upon the pulley block chain, this
feature is a tremendous safety
factor.
8. Last, but not least. The “2240”
Triple-geared Pulley Block is
a splendid All-British Product
made by Herbert Morris & Co.,
Ltd., England.
“2240” Pulley Blocks range from scwt. to 20 tons. stocks Overhead Cranes (hand and electric),

The double event, the Race Convention
and the Race Carnival, has drawn Irish pat-
riots to the city from all parts of Austral-
asia. What with all-day conferences at the
Auditorium and monster meetings at night,
the air h'as been tingling with oratory. One
daily paper mentioned that only lay mem-
bers of the Convention were going to the
Cup; but it happened that a few clerics
(non-mitred) were out Flemington way, and
just dropped in to see the roses.
A “Back to Ivyneton” movement, to last
a week, is being organised for January, 1920.
If the promoters insist upon having all the
old boys back from Melbourne there will be
no end of people acting in responsible posi-
tions from January 24 to 31. Watt (Fed.
Treasurer), Lieut.-Gen. White, Morrison
(Public Service Commissioner), Minogue
(Under Treasurer), # Mitcliell (leader of the
Bar), Nally (Water Commission Sec.),
Maling (“Ithuriel” of the Argus) and scores
of dimmer lights will have to obey the sum-
mons.
The war has been suspended for over 12
months, but the Hughes Government expects
to spend during the year to June 30, 1920,
over £52,000,000 of War Loan money, and if
Hughes’s gratuity of £25,000,000 to soldiers
comes to pass the amount will be £77,000.000.
In fact, Hughes seems capable of spending
more on war in peace time than in real war
time, even debiting the cost of wheat silos
and advances to local bodies against the late
lamented conflagration. The next war is
liable to find us still borrowing on the
strength of the old one, and then the accounts
will get as badly mixed as those of the wheat
pool that trod on the other wheat pool’s
heels.
The plea that we can’t do it in Australia
because our wages are too high is badly
bumped by a manifesto issued by the Em-
ployers’ Assoc, at the start of the great steel-
workers’ strike in U.S.A. It showed that
the majority of workers employed did better
than 255. a day, though the average was
slightly under that but above £l. The aver-
age earnings of sheet rollers for an eight-
hour day were: Heaters £4 45., roughers £2
75., catchers £2 75., steel-pourers £2 11s. 3d.,
vesselmen £2 18s. 6d., engineers and mani-
pulators £2 4s. 9d. These were the daily
wages taking the £1 sterling at 4.85 dollars.
Semi-skilled labor got £1 to £2 a day, while
common labor was paid Is 9d. to 2s. an hour,
or £25 to £2B a month. It isn’t what you
pay but what you get for what you pay that
matters.
Now that the returns are in it seems that
the Government is to buy up at a fixed
minimum price, supposed to be higher than
could be got otherwise, all the crop of
wheat, cotton, sugar and flax and some
sundries. There is no reason to the con-
trary, but if the Government also offered
to buy up all the crop of pianos, woollen
goods, machinery, etc., grown in local fac-
tories it would be just as logical. Appa-
rently it is held that the sturdy manufac-
turer can get along without a guarantee and
also without specially-low railway rates and
cheap loans and seed wheat and exemption
from wage awards, while the “backbone of
the country” can’t. The backbone seems
rather like a dead serpent trying to stand on
his tail.
Naturally, being run on R.N. lines, mostly
with R.N. heads, we send abroad for every
sort of specialist, even though we have sent
our own brainy youngsters to England and
elsewhere to complete their training in those
specialties at public expense. We not only
send “abroad” for a shipping controller
(£2OOO a year) and a chief marine engineer
(£lOOO a year), but even for a draughts-
man, a foreman ironworker ar.d a foreman
shipwright. Meantime private firms snap
up the youthful professional Australians.
What has the Royal Commission on Naval
and Defence Administration said about the
loss of a Diesel engine expert to an Ameri-
can shipbuilding firm at a large salary, an
engineering draughtsman grabbed by a big
Sydney co., an electrical expert gone to a
famous electrical firm, and an expert boiler-
maker gone to work for private shipbuilders?
These men represent thousands of pounds
wasted and much Australian sentiment
killed.
W. C. Hill, formerly a Melbourne outer-
suburban train starter, is now a Poo-Bah
who is particular that one part of him should
not be confounded with the other part of
him; if it is, a private secretary has to write
to the papers about it. As president of the
Farmers’ Union or as chairman of directors
of a phosphate co. he knows nothing of him-
self as an M.H.R. A Melbourne journal
recorded that he accompanied a deputation
to Minister Clarke to ask to be allowed to
buy portion of 40 acres at Spotswood, already
marked off for the Metropolitan Gas
monopoly. He then had it “pointed out” to the
paper that the talk was an interview and not
a deputation, and that the Minister saw a
company director and not a Parliamentarian.
Hill, M.H.R., would scorn to join director
Hill in trying to bargain for a bit of the
public estate in private. In fact, it is not
clear that in his public capacity Mr. llili
would be even seen drinking a lemonade with
Mr. Hill in his private capacity.
Vic. Treasurer McPherson proposes to
spend his alleged surplus of £318,521 by
paying £lOO,OOO off the accumulated revenue
deficit of £1,517,208, repaying £50,000 for
relaying lines with heavier rails, and setting
aside £90,000 for education (including
£lO,OOO for a school of agriculture at Mel-
bourne Uni.), £25,478 to repay advances
for railway sidings, £23.442 towards ’flu
exes., £24.800 for flood and drainage works,
and £5OOO toward constructing the eastern
breakwater at Warrnambool. He looks for-
ward to a surplus of £51,000 for the current
year, but he lias made no provision for the
higher wages which the Railway Classifica-
tion Board may award. If the actual sur-
plus is not sufficient to meet the increases
he warned Parliament that the Government
may be compelled to review freights and
fares. The Budget is a thing of shreds and
patches—a glorified balance-sheet summary.
The bald paragraph announcing no new taxa-
tion looks as if Lawson, as sub-editor, marked
it in when he saw the proof, so that some-
thing should be clear besides a claim that
there was a net profit on State enterprises,
taken as a whole, of £32,198.

Although the great war is over and peace
has been signed, statesmen, who are in
the best position to judge, are repeatedly
emphasising the serious position which
to-day confronts the British Empire from
a commercial point of view. The nation
which is the most efficient in its internal and external
organisations must become the greatest.
Efficiency counts in Nations and Individuals. The Nation
that prospers is the Nation internally sound; so it is with
the individual. A clean, sound and well-regulated system
is needed to bs an efficient man or woman —one who goes
ahead and makes a mark in the world.
The lack of proper energy to get the best results is often due
to a weakened system caused by Constipation or Indigestion.
This condition will undermine the strongest constitution,
reduce its resisting power, and make it weak and ineffective.
Take Dr. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS to open up the
stopped-up ducts and give Nature a chance to re-assert herself. New
blood, rich and red, will soon be coursing through the veins, and health,
strength and vigor will soon follow. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a
highly efficient remedy, and they produce highly efficient results, and
make efficient men and women.

“Lou”: The Bulletin's repeated de-
mands for another thorough overhaul of the
Defence Department’s medical service get
support from a Brisbane experience. A
while ago the Department sold surplus stock
of 40,000 “No. 9” pills for 2/- per 1000.
Within two months jt had placed an order
for 10 gross of the same pills at 2/6 per

Melbourne City Council has declined to
give orders to Aikmun, who is to wear the
gold chain from Nov. 10, as to the manner
in which processions (notably the St.
Pat ’s Day parade) shall be conducted. Aik-
man is to have discretionary power. Mel-
bourne is, however, very tired of proces-
sions, and wouldn’t mind if they were
declared a thistle or other noxious weed for
three years.
A minor tragedy happened in a fashion-
able hairdressery. A young matron was
having her luxurious tresses brushed when
she heard a cheery “Hello, Nancy !” from a
neighboring cabinet, and impulsively she
burst in with flowing hair to see who her
friend was. At that moment the friend
was wearing only a thin natural covering
of grey strands, while her street head of
liair was in the henna pot. They started
by not speaking when they met. Then one
of them thought better of it, and the awful
secret they share has drawn them closer
together than ever.
Sou-East”: In his essay, “The Sea is
God’s” (B. 2/10/T9), “Albatross” refers to
the fact that seafarers who fetch and carry
for the world have little in common with
land workers. I feel inclined to go further
and say that seafarers are as different from
land toilers as artists are from artisans. To
begin with, only men with artistic tempera-
ments would want to travel about on the
rocking waters. The other sort of people want
tieshpots and birthrights more than the
smell of a strange port and the sight of new
lands. Half the trouble with firemen and
other seafarers simply arises from failure
to recognise their artistic temperament.
“Ornis”: It was the late Ferdinand
Ivayser’s energy, foresight and brains that
made the Bisehoff co.’s big mine what it
was. Under his control this Waratah (Tas.)
show was the world’s biggest single pro-
ducer of tin concentrates. Bisehoff was
formed in 1873, and Ivayser was put in
charge in 1875, and remained boss for 31
years. Trained to the practice of large Ger-
man shows, then the most advanced in the
world, he soon decided that to develop the
proposition as it should be he would require
considerable plant. His fights with his
board and shareholders would have broken
the heart of many another man. Eventually
lie got his own way, and not only fitted the
dressing-sheds with all the best appliances
then in use in tin-ore concentration, but in-
vented, among other things, an ore-dresser
which probably has never been beaten for
economical working and cleanness in con-
centrating. The co. spent £lOO,OOO in the
five years before the first dividend was de-
clared, and then they came thick and fast,
two a month for some time. Shareholders
pocketed dividends without a gap until the
outbreak of war, and then 15 months were
skipped. When Kayser gave up control of
the mine over two millions, or £176 ss. per
share, had been handed to shareholders.
The yarn of the advance courier: —-
It’a a hard game posting up bills these times.
Boys tear them off, rain moves them and other
shows cover them up. In some towns when you
post them low the goats eat them, and when you
post them high people won’t read them. When
I was ahead of Dan Barry I got to Deloraine (Tas.)
and stuck a poster on the local G.P.O. The con-
stable promised that we would be fined 40s. if it
was left there. The boss said the ad. was worth
the money, so we left it. But the police only got
hot water and cleaned the bill off. In Tasmania
I booked the opposition hall, and the Wynyard Coun-
cil fined me £2 for defacing the town. At Shef-
field (Tas.) a cocky reversed his fence rails to
conceal my bills for “Divorced.” Many of the
Speck’s billposters can’t read or write. In one town
the local agent billed our co. and displayed most
of the matter upside down. He afterwards explained
that he required arrows on his paper to give the
direction. The local posters in Ballarat and Tar-
ragon (Vic.) have one arm each. They steady the
posters with their teeth. You walk leagues to bill
some scattered towns. In Ouyen (Vic.) I walked
eight miles. I climbed three miles up a mountain
in Beaconsfield to deliver a handbill to a man. But
that was to win a wager. I billed an old flourmill
at Mooroopna (Vic.), and the building was later re-
moved to Ouyen. The daybills were still
intact when wa showed there, and I only needed to
re-date them. A circus man put a menagerie bill
on the Victoria Hotel fence at Port Darwin. While
it was damp some joker peeled it off and stuck it
on Dr. Gilruth’s gatepost.
“Wart”: When Governor Collins sailed
to found the Port Phillip Settlement he took
a printing press with him, and it was set
up and used during the stay. When he aban-
doned the mainland and moved to the Der-
went and settled on the site of Hobart, the
press was set up under a gum-tree and used
for printing Government “orders.” In 1810
he authorised a semi-official newspaper, the
Derwent Star and Van Diemen’s Land
Intelligencer. The printers were .T.
Barnes and T. Clark. You get the atmos-
phere of the place from the first wedding an-
nouncement :
On Monday, 26th ult., R. C. Burrows to Elizabeth
Tucker, both late of North of Ireland. They had
cohabited together for 14 years, verifying the old
adage “better late than never.”
The paper ran to 12 numbers. The seventh
was an account of Collins’s death and burial.
The burial, by the way, cost the English
Government £507 Bs. 3d. for mourning for
the convicts and officials. In 1814 Clark
made a second attempt with the Star, but
it did not last much longer than the first.
The Hobart Town Gazette, started by
Andrew Bent, with Emmett as editor, was
the first real newspaper. Bent soon fell foul
of Arthur, who had him imprisoned and fined
half a dozen times. Bent died in Sydney.
In 1825 George Terry Howe carted a press
and type up to Launceston in a bullock wag-
gon and started the Tasmanian. The wag-
gon was upset on the way, and all the type
spilled. The paper did not last long, as
Arthur got Howe to return to Hobart and
help Dr. Ross run the Gazette, Arthur’s
tame paper. In 1529 S. Dowsett published
the Launceston Advertiser, and John Pascoe
Fawkner the Cornwall Press ; and that
brings us down to sufficiently modern times.

Mother—look at his tongue!
Give him Chamberlain’s Tablets, quick!
He wont eat ? Then, don’t
scold !! See if his tongue is coated
white, breath feverish. If so his
stomach is out of order.
A stomach out of order does not
sound much. Yet it makes a child
mighty miserable. It makes him
bilious, his appetite poor and vari-
able. He is fretful and nattering,
restless in his sleep.
A few doses of Chamberlain’s
Tablets will quickly set him right.
They will clear the sour stomach.
This will sweeten the breath and
create a healthy appetite.
They promote the flow of gastric
juices,, thereby inducing good
digestion.
The most valuable thing to have
in your medicine chest is a box of
THEfSToriacn Lived
Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
fatal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic andlDiarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual J?Vsseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges ti e stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care.should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when this remedy is at hand all danger
jaay be avoided.
15e Firm.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.

Grand Opera at Melbourne Majesty’s
rather noticeably failed to reach its race-
time opportunities. It lacked punch. There
were great audiences, hut they seemed little
stirred, nor was the want of enthusiasm
wholly owing to the fact that the crowds
had more horse than music in their soul.
Apart from Amy Castles, in “Butterfly”
and “Faust,” no individual voice among the
principals is rich in the essential oil of
melody ; and though every revival of grand
opera must serve to increase the number of
people who follow it because they want to,
rather than because they ought to, there is
not in this case any new personal attrac-
tion. The entertainment is liberal, in point
of chorus, staging and orchestra (at times
the orc’hestra puts the singing almost out of
hearing), but it is not epoch-making. How-
ever, the promise is there of a purely Aus-
tralian co. which shall be an established
school for native talent.
* * * *
Amy Castles made only one appearance
during the week —as Marguerite. She isn’t
the ideal artless German "'maiden who goes
astray at the first provocation, but her per-
sonality is pleasing in the part, and in voice
and acting she is solidly satisfactory. If
the inactive prima donna doesn’t get inside
a part by her own exertions, the part may
be said to associate itself with her at the
time. She deserved a more forcible Faust
than Ralph Errolle, and a less ornate Siebel
than Thelma Carter, who has a comic-
opera smile and not much in the way of
song. Errolle’s figure of Faust is gaudy
but not picturesque ; his acting is mechanical
and tame (a common failing with Fausts),
and liis top notes are unambitious. Ap-
parently the insipidity of his pupil has a
depressing effect on Alfredo Valenti’s Meplii-
stopheles—a sad, elderly gentleman with a
quaint red-velvet head of hair and a smooth
sweet basso of limited volume. When Miss
Castles wasn’t domiciled in the dwelling-
pure and lowly, Patti Russell reigned as
Marguerite, and then one felt that the
young spinster, with such a larky Martha
as Vera Bedford in charge of her, would
have had a jazz party on the premises as
soon as brother Valentine was off to the war.
Carl Formes is the Valentine when Patti
Russell is his sister, and he carries more
dramatic guns than Raymond Loder, who
gets duelled to death on account of Amy
Castles. Antique “Trovatore” served for
one night during the week, whereas the
“Cavalleria”-“Pagliacci” bill was a twicer.
Since Lois and Leah Myers duettod in
“Cavalleria” at the Princess’s, both have
improved. The tenor’s voice is stronger and
smoother than it was, and the lady is less
crude in her dramatic intensity. As before,
“A TAILOR-MADE
MAN,” AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Frank Hawthorne as Pomeroy.
she gets occasionally off the note, nor is
her voice of fine quality. But she has force,
like Elsie Treweek in the part of Lola —and
j/nlike Fred Collier as Alfio, the teamster.
Collier is the most honest of vocalists, his
enunciation of his words is a pleasure, and
he looks well and behaves with discretion;
but lie needs more color in his action.
Walter Wheatley did well enough in the
grateful part of Canio in “Pagliacci,” and
as much may be said of Formes as the
blighted clown who delivers the prologue.
Also Eileen Castles (ohee or twice out of
tune) made a winsome Nedda, especially
when she sported a white wig for the play
within the opera ; and Frank Charlton, the
tame Silvio of the eo., promises to do best
of all when he has acquired more confidence
in his qualifications.
“Tales of Hoffmann” had its first run last
Saturday, with Errolle in the name part.
With Wheatley in his stead the Offenbach
opera will be repeated to-morrow (Friday)
night. Chorus and scenic fixings go for
much in “Hoffmann,” and the barcarolle
shines like a star ’midst the booze, frivolity
and unconvincing mysticism which makes
this work hard to take seriously. The
J C.W. performance puts it in a less serious
light than usual. Errolle and Thelma Carter
(Nicklaus) have the comic-opera style; Tom
Minogue presents Coppelius as a farcical
Jew Fagin, and even Dapertutto the
magician (Carl Formes) is not half as ter-
rible as such an unmitigated enemy of man-
kind should be. Here, as elsewhere, Collier
wins approval of his fine, unexciting voice
and plain integrity of purpose in two of
the Tales ; Eileen Castles is a shrill Doll
with a healthy sense of humor; Elsie Tre-
week is a soprano misplaced in the con-

tralto part of the courtesan. Much of the
charm of the barcarolle is lost in the
Treweek-Carter duet at the outset of the
third act. To-night (Thursday) brings the
second performance of “Bohfeme,” with Amy
Castles, sister Eileen, Wheatley and Loder
in the principal parts. Melbourne has
pleasant recollections of how Amy walked
quietly through the part of Mimi, at a few
hours’ notice, a few years ago.
“Tails Up,” the immediate successor to
“Buzz Buzz,” at Melbourne Tivoli, is a
more interesting production in exactly the
same .style. Scenes happen, and darkness
comes to pass, and a handsome pair of cur-
tains serve as a screen for scene-shifting or
as a background for Aldridge when he sings
of love. From first to last the principal scenes
are neatly furnished with conventional
character sketches, and if the crinolined
sentiment of “Milestones” creeps into one
comedietta, or the blue-blooded butler idea
from “Fanny’s First Play” is borrowed for
another, or Peter Pan pops up in a Deserted
Park, nobody will object that these things
are in questionable taste. “Tails Up” leaves
an agreeable taste in the mouth, and the
only tiresome parts of the show at the opening
matinee were a couple of tuneless coon dit-
ties by bright little Nell Fleming. In a rapid
succession of raiments Minnie Love beams
to great advantage. She avoids the long-
drawn-out song of suffering, and gives full
scope to her versatility and sense of humor.
One Minnie in her time plays many parts,
and plays all of them well. Phil Smith
presents an assortment of elderly persons;
George Gee and Steff Macdonald are admir-
able in two or three places apiece; Gwen
Burroughs, Clarice Hardwicke, Nodin.
Ilardinge and the inevitable Rego are of
more or less consequence, and the girl who
dances with George Gee at Vauxhall is
Mabel Holmes.

“Lightnin’ ” has touched its 13th week at
Melbourne Royal. Two nights last week
Miss Mayne resumed her understudy of the
part of Bill Jones’s wife, but on Saturday
the original lady (Victory Bateman) was
back in the kitchen at the Easy Divorce
Hotel.
The millinery expert does the Circus: —
At Wii'ths’ Circus, which is hard at it again in
Melbourne, special red baize boxes have been
arranged on the ground floor close to the clown and
his dogs, and circle seats have been added where the
stage used to be. The stage is now a vast thing
on wheels, with a big purple petticoat. Brisbane,
the littlest trick pony, has a new dress of mauve and
cerise ribbons. The elephants’ Cup frocks are amber
and cerise embroidered with jewels. A new bareback
rider, Beattie d’Alma, scores in a brief skirt of white
chiffon satin and a bodice of swansdown. A remark-
ably prettly girl is on in the Garcias’ duet. She
jazzes on the tight-wire and twirls a white-frilled
parasol. The big foyer where the lions and tigers
and ponies wait their turn is an airy place, where
the smell of wild beast isn’t an offence, and the
audience can come out and smoke or gather at the
soda fountain in great comfort. Circus-chief Wirth
illuminates this foyer with tie-pin diamonds and
talks proudly of niece May, trained by the brothers
as a bareback rider, and now putting £lOO a week
into her stocking in New York.
The happiness of “ ’Possum Paddock” at
Melbourne King’s is still being threatened
by the mortgage and the villain, but those
two nightmares are removed by the inter-
vention of the widow Oarsley. That reliable
lady is particularly brilliant in saving the
McQuade homestead for the family. When
the property is auctioned by the bank, she
steadily outbids a relentless neighbor until
he collapses from want of funds.
Annette Ivellerman is in motion at Hoyt’s,
Melbourne, this week in an elaborate Fox
film christened “Queen of the Sea.” An-
nette, as Queen Merilla, pursues the usual
amphibious career until she anchors in the
arms of her insipid Prince Hero. “Love’s
Conquest,” Hoyt’s second attraction, intro-
duces Lina Cava fieri as a 16th-centur.y
widow who scorns the affections of fashion-
able canoodlers and takes a mate from the
lowah ordahs. “The Roaring Road,” .with
Wallace Reid and Ann Foote in the prin-
cipal nlaces, gets its roar from a well-staged
race between a motor and a train. At the
Majestic, “The One Woman” is prodding the
intellects of the populace with its allusions
to Socialism. Free Love and Divorce. The
supporting film. “Destiny.” is a more ortho-
dox story, with a big heartache expertly
handled by Dorothy Phillips.
A professional view of it: —
That the Armistice show in Martin-place (Sydney)
was a failure was the fault partly of incompetent
supers and partly of insufficient rehearsal. The prin-
cipals were all right. Governor Davidson has the
dramatic sense well developed, in addition to a good
stage presence and voice. He spoke his lines With
force and vigor. W. A. Holman was fair, though
his air of diffidence on being required to face the
multitude was poorly done. But much of the re-
maining business was riotously ragged—-as, for in-
stance, the head-baring stunt at 11 a.m. First the
civilians removed their tiles while the naval and
military representatives stood at the salute. Then
the Governor whipped off his cocked hat (which is
neither a civvy nor a service affair) ; whereupon
Commander Glossop furtively removed his uniform
cop. General Lee, standing behind, made haste to
fellow suit; and five seconds later a couple of staff-
officers who had been standing moodily at ease
behind the General bared their skulls also. The
dressing of several of the staff-officers, by the way,
was a disgrace to the management. Poisonously new
Sam Brown belts, adjusted by obviously-inexperienced
hands, and tunics and breeches which didn't fit any-
where, were conspicuous. The tall hat of Captain
Teece, of the R. S. League, should only be used for
low-comedy purposes. Deplorable is the only word
to apply to the dressing of most of the Consuls. The
one creditable figure amongst the minor characters
was that of the Archbishop of Sydney. He looked
the part. The tendency of the politicians was to
appear like shifty racecourse touts. But perhaps they
weren’t in the play.

“My Lady Frayle” was breathed upon by
influenza when she appeared first at Sydney
Tivoli. After a long interval, the grey-
haired lady who gets herself rejuvenated by
the Devil in order that she may have one
more flirtation has been revived and given
another run. Vera Pearce is handsome in
the name-part, and Claude Flemming is a
moderately successful drawing-room fiend.
But the show sags when it is trying to be
“a Musical Play of Heart Throbs” and “the
Sweetest Story Ever Told on the Stage.”
The dry humor of Bert Clark, the chorus
work, and the dancing help it out.
* ❖ ❖ *
“Going Up” (still at Sydney Majesty’s)
has fallen into the habit of bragging about
its great age. Now in its 12th week, it
cackles in the manner of the Oldest In-
habitant when visitors gather round his
chair.
The lovers of sentiment and mild humor
are stepping lightly to Sydney Palace to
visit “Oid Lady 31,” in which Sara Allgood
shows how sweet the American playwright
can make a mature heroine without actually
killing her with kindness.
At Sydney Crystal Palace and Strand
Connie Talmadge is a fascinating feminist,
Suzanne Ercoll, who can spare only Satur-
day to Monday for matrimony. So every
Saturday she packs her sponge bag and
rings the door-bell of husband’s fiat, and

Peter ( Harry Paullon) hired for the night.
every Monday departs gaily. One Monday
she turned back; and because no woman
does that with impunity, she found another
in the domestic nest. Then things moved
in the time-worn way. Suzanne tried to
make her husband jealous; but when that
scheme failed she just settled down to be an
all-round-the-clock wife and scrutineer of
her husband’s visiting-list. Doreen and her
Bloke are camping this week at the
Lyceum; and Viola Dana wears the clothes
of an Apache-bred girl with the most allur-
ing results. Her spasm is called "The
Parisian Tigress.” ‘‘False Faces” appear
at Hoyt’s and the Haymarket. This is the
further adventure of the Lone Wolf, who
throws up the old hobby of safe-cracking 10
strike a blow at the Hun. There are plois
and counter-plots, submarines and sealed
orders in cylinders. At the Shell the gloomy
Ibsen makes the shadows darker in "A Man
There Was.”
“Maytime” scores heavily at Adelaide
Royal. The music is not much, but the-
story is original. Gladys Moncrieff, who has
learned to act, is effective whether as girl,
reckless young matron or elderly widow, and
Leslie Holland’s humor pleasantly pervades
the whole story. Jennie Opie is now his
third wife, Florence Young the Mme. Del-
phine, and George Welch scores in the writ-
ten-up little part of the auctioneer. The cos-
tumes are remarkable. Conrad Power lias
dropped out from the Tivoli Co. of Irish
tilavers, but “Con the Shaughraun” persists,
Philip Dellcourt and Selwyn Lindsay coming
Half of the Majestic programme is now:
filled by Tom Haverley and his clever song-
and-dance crowd. Of the rest Archie and
Gertie Falls are most prominent. In pic-
tures the public declines to part with “Daddy
Long Legs.” which is being shown at both
Pav. and West’s; the latter house also has
a curious “Spark Divine.” in which Alice
Joyce cannot be persuaded to be fond of her
own child until her husband fakes the ex-
treme sten of having it kidnapped. The
most striking thing at Wondergraph is a
clever burlesque of the Far West mining town
of the screen ; Fatty Arbuckle as “A Deseri
Hero” does some remarkable shooting and
makes sober citizens _of the rum-hounds.
Daisy Kennedy, Adelaide’s own violinist, has
brought back ecstatic notices from Europe’s
best critics, and announces a series of reci-
tals at the Town Hall.
“The next thing he saw was Mahomet
coming down in a cloud of bricks and mor-
tar.” It reads like a postscript to Revela-
tion, but it is only part of the story told
at the inquest by the Sydney contractor who
warned one Mahomet Abdullah not to ven-
ture on an archway in the wall he was

Scott’s Creek (S.A.) has had one of the
most astonishing shooting fatalities on re-
cord. Several boys of the Gliddon family
were out rabbiting. While they were at a
burrow the gun was laid on one side, flat
and safe; but one of the dogs scurried
across, its foot caught the trigger, and the
eldest boy was fatally shot.

“Norbell”: As to the dispute whether
Marie Lolir ever appeared on the stage in
Australia, I find from an old programme
that at a benefit to George Rignold at Syd-
ney Majesty's on September 10, 1895, one
item was “Little Marie Lolir in her ex-

“U.F.”: Mrs. Crocker Smith, who died in
Melbourne the other day, was one of Adel-
aide's Inost popular singers in the ’seven-
ties—she was then Eva Thomas. Half a
ceil tiny ago, when “Norma” was presented in
Adelaide, Crocker Smith (at that time in the
employ of John Hodgkiss and Co.) took one
of the leading parts. He died many years
a 2o. A daughter of the taleyited couple is
the wife of Federal politician Robert Best.
“Konini”: The jazz is not new. Jazzers
make of unmake the whirligig, according to
their personality. I remember a jazz that
was called an all-in-polka, and I wouldn’t
dare to say what. I saw Hying from the flag-
pole in the morning.
"Old Pot”: D’Orsay Ogden (B. (>/11/’l9j

“American frontier” actors we have seen
in Australia. The Colonel, as he was
always called, rather startled the critics by

capital all-round
man, though I do

The n e x t-best

as good a S'in on

was T. D. Hamil-

From London :
Connie Ediss, back in England, has joined Cyril
Maude, who is just back too, and is touring in “Lord
Richard in the Pantry.” Frederick Ross, the first
“Message from Mars” hero that Australia saw, is in
the new spectacular melodrama at Drury Lane, “The
Great Day,” by Louis Parker and G. R. Sims; he
plays a self-made Yorkshire profiteer. Small but
strong parts in this play are taken by Hugh Buckler
as a shell-shocked soldier and Violet Paget as a
“creature of the underworld” in Paris. Rawlings
and Plunkett are hack from Australia, too, and
have good parts at the Adelphi in “Who's Hooper?”
—which is the old Pinero farce “In Chancery” set
to music. Irene Browne is at the Savoy in an
American farce, “Tod Many Cooks.” And at the
Alhambra, in Oscar Asche’s new “Eastward Ho!”
Eddie and Decima McLean have definitely established
themselves as favorites.
“Stargazer” : When the firm was preparing
to produce “Much Ado” at Melbourne Bijou,
during the currency of the wonderful Brough
and Boucicault Comedy Co., Boucicault. as
producer, was beset by an unknown with
some of the brands of a veteran about him.
He rather thought he could play Benedick
wonderfully well. Dot Boucicault, yielding
to Mummery’s pertinacity, gave him a few
lines to memorise, and when he next called
he was allowed to hurl them off his chest.
He hurled them with such effect that Dot
sat down and indicted a note fixing a job
for the distinguished unknown. Mummery
came back in a few moments. “Sir,” he
said, with some dignity, “there is some mis-
. take, I think. This note, I find, is a request
to the general manager to give me a place
as an er —an usher, in fact.” “Yes,” said
Boucicault, “that is right.” The unheard of
celebrity inflated his nostrils and threw back
his leonine mane. “An usher, sir,” he said.
"Very well, then, I accept; but' you are
making a terrible mistake, sir.” When the
play had been going three nights, Mummery
reappeared. “It is possible, sir, you may be
willing to reconsider the matter now that
you have seen your present Benedick at
work. I have a proposition to make. It
is this, sir—that Mr. Titheradge and I play
Benedick alternating weeks, each of us one
week as Bened : ck and one week as usher.”
Boucicault was pretty sure Mr. Titheradge
would not entertain this idea, and his guess
proved to be correct. Mummery went away
again, and stood it for another three nights.
Then once more he appeared before the
stage-manager, and hurled a formidable
roll of foolscap on the table before him.
“It is not, sir. the indignity of being an
usher that I object to. I leave because of
the utter impossibility of continuing nighi
after night to watch that unfortunate fellow's
attempts to play Benedick.” Then Mummery
made his exit R.U.E. Boucicault opened
the roll. It was Mummery’s resignation,
drawn up with severe formality, and cover-
ing three sheets, with the capital letters
each an inch high.
The familiar Old Actor finds a fresh set-
ting in a new novel. “Crabtree House.” This
one, down and seemingly out. through being
called to the Bar too often, reforms, and
gets a job as lift-man at a fashionable
restaurant. He is left regarding with amaze-
ment the £8 his tips have amounted to in
a week, and murmuring. “My God! and I
only got six for playing Hamlet!”
“Fleet-street”: W. S. Gilbert’s work is
to the front at the moment here in London.
The romantic, farcical, non-musical “Pyg-
malion and Galatea” is being played eight
times a week at the Scala, and seven of the
operas are being given in the open air by a
company of 400.
“Silvertail”: The illness of Kate Bishop
(B. 23/10/T9) reminds me of George Rig-
nold’s “Faust” in the early ’9o’s. Mar-
guerite (Miss Bishop) was too nervous to
go up with the angels, so a girl having simi-
lar features was the Marguerite of the ascen-
sion scene. The chorus in the flies, used
to sing
Now is the weavv heart at. rest,
Angels bear thee to the blest.
The stage represented the city of Nurem-
burg, and the city descended beneath the
stage as the angels ascended into the clouds.
One night just as the city had almost dis-
appeared, the large black theatre cat walked
quietly across the housetops, and in some
cases through thin air. The angels giggled,
and th-e deceased Marguerite had to cover
her face with her hands, while George stood
in the wings asking the angels what the
Cecil Brooking, who played Alaric in
“Peg o’ My Heart,” is at present in South
Africa, but hopes to be in Sydney by
Christmas. He is due to open with the
Taits about then. He would have been
here before but that there was no service
of steamers.
“T. D. Emdee”: Julius Knight loathed
Marcus Superbus, with which his name is
oftenest associated in Australia, and he re-
garded Gil de Berault as one of his best
parts, though his ambition was to play Ham-
let. Harcourt Beatty hated to speak of
King Charles 11., beyond doubt the part
in which he made his name here; and,
although J. C. Williamson’s John Stofel will
nevpr be forgotten, he fancied himself most
as Kerry in Dion Boucicault’s play. I
saw old “Bouci” in it. and. although he
polished a really bald head with his silk
hanky and J.C.W. wore a wig, the latter’s
was the better performance, and J.C.W.
was right in preening himself. Most folk
will remember Kingston in “Brewster’s
Millions,” but his fancy was as Carton in
“The Only Wav,” an adaptation of Dic-
kens’s ‘‘Tale of Two Cities.”
“Silas Snell”: I knew him first as an
insatiable reciter. You were apt to meet
him at any smoke-night from which he was
not deliberately excluded. He confided to
me that his one ambition in life ivas to be
an actor, and a great actor at that. “You
will yet see me as Hamlet on the Princess’s
stage,” he said. This was at a time when the
Princess’s was Melbourne’s swaeger hon m
I saw him again during the week preceding
the Cup, standing on a box in front of a
small show contained in a shop, and con-
sisting mainly of a gargantuan swallower
who engulfed whole candles among other
things, and an eight-legged goat which, if
the poster did not belie it, could walk as
well turned on its back as the correct way
up. He was spruiking with great energy
and eloquence. He caught my eye. and must
have divined the thought behind it, for he
said: “Well, well, not Hamlet yet; but on
the way, my boy —on the way.”
Oscar Asche is going back to his old
favorite “Othello.” The run of "Chu Chin
Chow” obstinately refuses to come to an
end, so Asche is going to smother Lily
Brayton at a series of charity matinees.
Simultaneously, Matheson Lang and Arthur
Bourchier, a very strong pair, are arranging
to appear as Othello and lago.

A send-off to Adelaide’s best-known show:
Albert Barneveld, the pioneer soap-box orator of
S. Aus., died on November 7 at 80. For 50 year-;
“Barney” had been an ornament of the Botanic
Park on Sundays. After the Labor party, 0.8. U.
and others got the habit, it is true he lost a portion
of his audiences, yet he always drew a crowd. He
could talk on anything, and he did, but it was
mostly religion, and his weird antics made him the
joy of the small boy. No matter what happened,
though, he kept his block. Barneveld was born in
Dickens’s London. At one time he accumulated
wealth, but “being the victim of unscrupulous men
in mining ventures,” he lost it all and died poor,
though he hugged his long frock coat and belltopper
to the end.
“Bungoanna”: I find on looking at the
programme of the new show at Melbourne
Tivoli that about as much information is
given concerning the show-ladies’ dress-
makers as about the show itself. Act 1.
scene 1, Miss Burroughs’, Miss Geddes’ and
Miss Gibbs’ dresses by ■. Act 1, scene
2. Miss Fleming's dress by . Act 1,
scene 6, Miss Love’s dress by . Act 1,
scene 8, Miss Love’s dress by , and so
through the whole bill. This seems to me
all lopsided. If the Tivoli management in-
sists on telling me who its dressmaker is.
in fairness it should go through the whole
catalogue. I want to know what tooth-paste
Miss Burroughs uses, who manicures Miss
Love, and lots besides. But for Heaven's
sake let’s have all this information in
another programme, so that those who
merely want a bill of the play may be saved
their present agony.
THE EMANCIPATION OF IRENE.
(A LIVING-PICTURE SYNOPSIS.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At Moocow, on the Billyball, there dwelt a lowly
maid.
Along the trickling Billyball her virgin footsteps
strayed.
A simple bush-bred lass, Irene. The freckles on her
nose
Were large as thripny pieces, many holes were in her
hose.
That bushmen loved her madly history’s heedless to
disclose.
She lived beneath the beetling range; the desert
more or less
Lay strewn around jier paling home of charming low-
liness.
Her father voosterl on a fence; her mother, gentle
soul,
Hoed spuds, and nursed the chicks, and fed the pigs
their daily dole.
And Irene loved Jim Billycan, who dug the water-
hole.
Her father said: “This cannot be!” Her mother
said: “Nay, nay !
The fellow eats what he can steal, and drinks his
union pay.”
But Irene cried: “To Waybaek girls emancipation
comes.
We’re free and independent 'neath our old ancestral
gums.
I’ll marry him I love to prove the ancient faith
succumbs.”
She tied her father to a tree, her mother to a post,
And rang the parson up. He came as pallid as a
ghost.
She held a pistol to his head; one to her father’s,
too,
And one to quell her ma. She said: “You’ll wed
me tight and true.
Here are the legal witnesses. A harness-ring will do.”
The parson drew attention to the absence of a ’groom.
She ’phoned for Jim, and on a tram he hastened to
his doom.
She roped him where he sat. “And now prepare
yourself,” said she ;
“You have a minute, James, to spare, and you will
marry me.”
His shrieks for mercy! mercy! were most pitiful
to see.
She clapped a pistol to his head. “Now, have a bit
of sense.
For sex equality,” she said, “has reached the bush.
Commence !”
They wed. She shed a tear and cried: “You see no
subtle art,
No force of guile, no human power can serve to
keep apart
A true-born Austral maiden and the darling of her
heart!”

Goodyear Belts have reformed belting practice
Goodyear belts have swept
away many of those old-time
defects in power-transmission
which cost so much in wasted time and
wasted energy. And this triumph was
won by no palliating device, but by the
sheer scientific perception of the difficul-
ties to be conquered and the application
of that treatment which provided for
every requirement of service.
Goodyear Belts have reformed belt-
ing practice. They have conquered slip
and stretch without the use of any
artifice such as “dressing,” perforation or
racking tension.
They have attained the strength and
pliability required for efficient, continu-
ous service. But this has been gained
without the disqualification of power-
dissipating weight.
They meet the need for economy as
fully as they meet the demand for
efficiency. They save money; they con-
serve power. They are designed to
combat successfully the conditions that
transmission belts must master.
Given the specification of the belt
needed to meet the exigencies of the
particular drive, Goodyear Belts will
supply every conceivable demand for
efficient service.
THE GOODYEAR TECHNICAL
MAN is at your call for just this service.
His specialised knowledge and continuous
experience of results will assist you to
secure not only the maximum service in
belts, and the consequent economies of
factory operation, but will insure the
effective transmission of power with its
accompaniment of maximum output of
machines or plant.
Our Specification of Goodyear Belt-
ing carries with it the acceptance of
responsibility for its satisfactory oper-
ation and wear. Write to our nearest
branch for particulars of the G.T.M.
service, which are free for the asking.

SPORTING
NEEDS
Habitufe of Flemington compared Artil-
leryman's easy victory in the Cup with the tiiree
or four lengths of Sasanof three years earlier In
each case it was a three-year-old who sprinted' sud-
denly to the fore and kept his commanding lead for
fully a quarter-mile before the finish; also in each
case the name of the second horse was truly pro-
before he was home. But when Sasanof
von the finish was a single-file procession—three or
four lengths between the leader and Shepherd King
another tiiree or four lengths In tween the King and
St. Spasa, and another big gap after the third. This
year there was but one big gap ; for although Rich-
mond Mam always had a distinct advantage over liis
immediate pursuers, Iris apparent certainty of second
place was due to the fact that Lucknow, “the nearest
of them, was losing ground by inches, rather than
gaining and Two Blues was not travelling fast
enough to do more than overtake Lucknow. But the
distance between the winner and the fourth horse
was gieater tfhan in Sasanof’s year. Officially stated
to have won by six lengths, Artilleryman must
have had 10 lengths to the good. The judge couldn’t
comfortably estimate the distance after the winner
had passed him, because he had to sit back and
wa.it for the close issue between Lucknow and Two
Blues, who just pipped the Caulfield Cup winner
on the post. Lucknow, as this column had predicted,
became very conscious of his 101 b. penalty as the end
drew near. He was, perhaps, one of the least
II P S’ees that ever made a fine showing 1 in a
Melbourne Cup with 9st. up. But he wasn’t a law
ot lacing unto himself. Not having been thoroughly
trained for the two-miles journey, he couldn’t be
expected to give 221 b. and a beating to a couple of
high-class colts in a new record time. The youn<«-
horse gets fit more easily than the older one,
and Lucknow is neither young 1 , as racers go, nor
hardy. He’s in his sixth year. A great horse, the
best and most honest that we’ve had from England
for racing purposes, but not a miracle.
Fred Burn had a picnic in the Steeplechase on
Cup day. His horse, Vanitor, was let into the handi-
cap at fist. 71b., and with the accomplished owner
m the saddle this respectable ’chaser was a 15 to 1
chance when betting opened. Punters Iwul mostly
forgotten that Vanitor won the Maiden Steeple at
the Grand National meeting, nor did they know the
full strength of his jumping powers. The fact of
trainer Burn thinking it good enough to ride the
horse should have warned them that Vanitor was
likely to upset the favorites, but they somehow
missed the tip. Vanitor is said to be a horse-of-all-
work in the Burn family. Sometimes they put him
between the buggy shafts, but usually he is a riding-
hack. ‘ "
Surveyor, the Maori land colt, certified further to
the quality of the colts that beat him in the Derby
by beating all but Cetigne, at w.f.a., in the mile
race last Thursday. Tto be nicked on the post by
Cetigne was no disgrace, anyhow. Greenstead, who
finished a neck behind Surveyor, appeared to be well
backed, but he didn’t look very bright in the coat
and possibly was only a littte less below concert
pitch than most other Sydney horses that ran at the
meeting.
The V.R.O. Oaks race was the Derby over again.
In a more tractable mood the favorite, Yarraldool,
would have won comfortably; but the filly lost
many lengths by running wide at the first” turn
after she had taken control of McLachlan. Pre-
viously she had lost a little steam while fighting
for her own way. and the end of it all was that
Hyades caught the hot-headed pacemaker close to
the post. The Oaks field contained nothing of much
importance. . Yarraldool is only a commonplace,
fiery little tiling, and the winner doesn’t look likely
to win again over 12 furlongs. Varcotine was put
about as a good thing for the event, for nq conceiv-
able reason. The book didn’t suggest that she
could beat Yarraldool, nor the betting, nor the run-
ning. Varcotine’s chance began and ended in rumor.
"Surveyor”: There’s many a slip ’twixt
the tip and the Cup. “Yarra Ben's” par re the very
early birds who attempted to tip the winner of the
big Caulfield event three months ahead caused me to-
look up the Melbourne Cup prognostications by the
same pair of prophets. The result, curiously enough,
is almost the same as in the former case except
that, the Age scores a first this time —it included
Artilleryman in its dozen. The Argus, as before,
didn't mention among the 12 it picked so much as
one of the placed horses. I'm thinking of turning
prophet myself. 1 couldn’t proph worse and 1 might
do better.
Bookmakers as well as punters were
astiay in their estimate of the Derby form this vear.
J r greedily laid B’s and 10’s against Richmond
Mam and Artilleryman for the Cup on the morning of
the race, although Night Watch and Kenilford had
lost credit by their performances on Derby Day, and
Lucknow alone of the older horses had maintained
his reputation. Had the positions of the Sydney
dead-heaters been reversed in the classic race on the
t.aturdaj the winner would certainly have started
first favorite, for already it began to look as though
the older nags were mostly off color or outclassed,
ileie and there, when the Derby was decided, one
heard the remark that the leading pair were likely
co beat the field for the Cup, b*t generally speaking
the defeat of Artilleryman seemed to have weakened
the crowd’s regard" for three-year-old form. Which
was hard to account for, seeing that, the crack
youngsters and Lucknow (who looked anything but
strung-up tor a two-mile struggle) were the most
reasonable fancies on their very latest running. The
public’s leaning to Menin and lan Or at the eleventh
hour was utterly unreasonable, but every Cup brings
its particular eccentricities in popular tips. The
Cup test, when it came to pass, proved a fair
knock-out for Sydney Spring form in the Metropoli-
tan and minor handicaps, and nothing was more con-
clusive in this respect than the achievement of old
two Blues in just pipping Lucknow for third place
m the Cup. British Arch and Two Blues had similar
pretensions, the one being a recent Waverley Handi-
cap winner Who bad better prospects than Dick
Meagher on paper,' whilst the other had been a
winner and runner-up .in the Waverley in former
years. Well, it turned out that Two Blues, who ran
second to Gadabout for the Waverley last year,
having won the 1-1 furlongs race the year before, was

li. Lewis, who rode his third Melbourne
Cup winner last week, is a
shrinking violet in spite
of his advanced age. Each
year the management of
YVirths’ Circus presents a
.whip to the winning-
jockey, and does its best
to lure the winner into the
ring on tire evening afte?
the race. Lewis this year
sent trainer I-ley wood to
accept the trifle, it being-
given out that lie himself
was “indisposed.” The coy
horseman, however, wasn’t
too poorly to occupy a
handy seat and listen to
the applause which went
with the gift. On a pre-
vious occasion Lewis was
doing the same thing when
the veil was rudely torn
from his incognito by an
onlookeress, who spotted
him and stood up to make
a speech on the subject of
them as hadn’t ought to
be given a whip if they
didn’t think enough of it
to get up like a man and
taJ:e it.
STUART BRUNTON,
the owner of Chrome.
0.K.”: In the future there can be no
more talk of hot favorites for the V.R.C. Derby-
being “unbeatable.” Artilleryman, as the subsequent
Cup race proved, was a good thing for the Derby,
notwithstanding that he had better horses to beat
than the flying Biplane met two years ago. His
paralysing turn of speed and fighting quality made
him a good thing, yet it happened that in the race
Artilleryman showed both his speed and his stamina
without winning it. His wonderful run was made
five furlongs from home, after he had been using up
a lot, of his force in fighting with his jockey. ' His
stamina, which enabled him to come again when he
been caught by Surveyor, was of no avail
against the well-timed spurt of Richmond Main in .the
last 50 yards. The difference in temperament, com-
bined with jockeyship that didn’t sufficiently indulge
Hie temperament, accounted for two defeats and a
dead-heat for Artilleryman in events which a less
wilful gee would have won. At Rosehill, Randwick
and then at Flemington in the Derby, this exception-
ally smart three-year-old disappointed his people.
Before the Cup, as afterwards, the trainer of Artil-
leryman said that his champion never should have
been beaten this season had circumstances been
fairly favorable. But after the boil over on the
Saturday his staunchest believers were bound to ha ve
some misgivings about the- hot-headed customer, and
it was not until he was seen travelling along con-
tentedly behind the leaders that they recovered eo>’fi-
dence in his ability to win the Cup. And how did
he win it!

“Leontine Scott” : Since the publication of
betting odds has been prohibited, early punters have
been looted. I have just compared two of the lists
which a bookie periodically forwards me. The first
came just after the Caulfield Cup, the second after
final acceptances for the Melbourne Cup. In the
interim 37 horses had faded from the picture, leaving
22 in. Comparison disclosed that of these 11 were
quoted at the same odds (or as near as dammit),
six had longer odds marked against them, and the
odds against five only were reduced. In only two
cases (those of Lucknow and Dick Meagher) were
the reductions at all important. Hence, if the
punter waited to see if it were really intended to
start his. horse, the chances were actually in favor
of his receiving better odds. And meantime the
wads which were ventured on the chances of non-
starters fell into the coffers of 1. Moses.. So much
for ante-post betting ‘‘under the lap.”

“ Billy TV’ : It happened at a big training
stable near Melbourne. An owner, bitterly disap-
pointed with the showing of his neddv, called one
morning recently, and assailed a jockey, about the
size of a well-nourished garden spider, accusing
him of all sorts of nefarious actions in connection
with the said racer, who, it appeared, should have
won everything, but had won nothing; in fact, had
hardly come within telescopic view of winning any-
thing, all due to dishonesty, bad judgment or
lunacy on the part of the rider. The horse-owner
was a large man, well over six feet, and with a
corporation that did “o’erhang and juttv its con-
founded base,” as the poet puts it. The jockey,
naturally a comhative little man, stood as much of
this as he could without bursting. Then he de-
liberately took up a kerosene-ease, carried it over
to the infuriated horse-owner, and, mounting on it,
took aim with ludicrous precision and swiped the
big man on the nose. The assaulted citizen made
a vain effort to get in touch with liis assailant, then
carried his trouble to the trainer in the stable
yard. He was making nrofane demands, involving
the excommunication and death of the jockey, when
Hie latter was seen approaching with fire in his eye.
The huge person with the disabled nose lingered for
one dubious moment, then turned in ignominious
flight. The small jock was carrying his kerosene-
case !
* * * *
The sports who were unluckiest over the
Gup—they will tell you sq themselves —are those
who left Perth in ample time to be in Melbourne
by Derby Day. Travelling by the Sunset line, they
were held up by the striae ini re, ami had to return
and start afresh by sea. They were on the water
when the Cup was run, reached Adelaide on Wednes-
day, and went on by tram to r lcnin.gton for tne
Oaks.
The moderate Vanitor proved nearly good
enough to win both the steeplechases at the V.R.C.
meeting. 11 is runaway victory on Gup Day had
brought him up a hit in (lie weights, but there was
really nothing for Vanitor to beat last Saturday,
unless there happened to be a bit of all-right among
the throwu-in lot. There was. Tiirrupman, at
(Ist. 21b., held Vanitor at his mercy all the way, and
after they had cleared the last fence together the
second favorite outpaced the first favorite without
being pushed.
With old Mistico out of the way in the Filial
Handicap, Ethiopian would have won his third race
at the meeting. Two years ago Ethiopian was a
strong fancy for• the Caulfield Cup, after winning a
race or two, hut he was rather uncertain and some-
what infirm, so the Tyes got rid of him, and the
world thought of him as a hack number.
If there were any remaining doubts as to what
Artilleryman should have done with Richmond Main
in the Derby, they were settled by the colt’s manner
of treating Cetignh over the same distance last Satur-
day. In winning the C. B. Fisher Plate from end to
end in 2min. 32isec., Artilleryman was just going
as he chose. In the first race of the day Yarraldool
had been allowed to gang her ain gait, with the
result that her 151 b. advantage in the weights
enabled the Oaks disappointment to keep ahead of
Surveyor all the way.
With Bullock atop the consistent Chrome had a
head to spare from Two Bings at the finish of the
V.R.C. Handicap (It mile) after a great t.us-le.
The clumsy nag was meeting T.B. on only 31b.
better terms than in the Cup, where he ran fifth
to the other fellow’s third, so it was probably the
difference between a boy and a mail on his back that
made the difference'in the two results. Besides, Two
Blues was also advantaged by having Killorn up
this time. But between the two horses that had
carried boys in the Cup, a stronger rider was a
bigger lift to Chrome.

“Widgee”: “Naming” (B. 23/10/’l9)
writes about the £5OOO Tatt.’s-winner who went
down to Hobart to collect in person in the days
when “it was the 'custom for winners of big prizes
to treat the staff of Tatt.’s with some generosity.”
That reminds me of something that looked as big
to me as a Tatt.’s win when it happened. It was .
when Auraria won the Melbourne Cup. I was an
office-youth in those far days, on. a whole 15 "bob,
per week, and saved up four weeks’ screw to put
on the mare. I went out in a new suit lo see the
nag win, put my £3 on, made a very careful examina-
tion of the bookmaker for identification purposes,
if necessary, and at the finish had a better view
of Mosaacs than of the winner. 1 was the first
to collect, and Mosaacs paid me with some petu-
lance. He gave me most of it “short,” but with
the last three- sovs. he played the ancient trick of
such persons, when dealing with raw youth, of
finishing up with “von ’undred one... .two —‘if
the lasht fV a bookie o’ wine?” Did he get it?
Even at the risk of “Narrung’s” scorn I must admit
that raw youth grabbed his filial quid with five
earnest fingers, and left Mosaacs cursing the mean-
ness of these young blankerth who’d -thee a pore
bookie broke in th’ gutter.

Karl Kitchener won the Oneenslancl Cun.
for the second'year' in succession, beating the Derby
winner, Boy Syce, fairly easily. The Chesterfield
Plate went to Ercanil, who accounted for a much-
fancied candidate in Sheila R. A hot favorite in
All Aboard was beaten pointless in the Birthday
Handicap, which went to Nairu. The Nursery
Handicap was a gift to Foremast (Welkin-Foremost),
who is half-brother to the S.A. performer Sunder.
Two contemporaries in Britain and Golden
Hop were represented by winners at Orange (N.S.W.)
on Saturday ; Whey, by the former, securing the Trial
Handicap and Mingala the Railway Handicap for
Golden Hop.

At the Auckland Spring meeting Gvenide*
(Demosthenes Gold Thread) took the Great Northern
Guineas, while the Welcome Stakes for two-year-olds
fell to Weary Willie. In the corresponding race at
Christchurch the consistent Moorfowl was successful,
his time being l-ssec. worse than Surveyor’s last
year. The New Zealand Cup, run at Riccarton, went
to Vagabond, whose time compares unfavorably with
Sasanoff’s last year.
* * * ■*
The fourth round of Sydney grade cricket
was started in summer weather, and batsmen mostly
did well. A notable exception was in the Padding-
ton v. Glebe match where Kelleway got five of the
easterners’ wickets for 30 ; O’Keen- hit up a spare-
ling 51 and M. A. Noble notched a stubborn 15
(n. 0.) of a total of 138. Glebe could only amass
38; Norman (seven for 17) and Noble (three for 14).
The team sadly misses the Bardsleys; but, of course,
the wicket was a poor one. In Petersham v. Wests,
Arnott, for the latter, took seven for 64 ; Petes, all
out 168. The batsmen mis-timed the bowling with
great consistency. Wests have lost two wickets for
174 ; K. B. Docker (69 not out) and Prentice (73)
made the Petersham trundling look worse than it
really was. Norths gave (for them) a timid batting
display v. Middle Harbor, getting but 229 runs.
M.H. have so far lost two lor 40, but have some
solid bats to go in. j
Uni. have lost nine wickets v. C, Cumberland for
420 runs. Boyce (192) and Donovan (166) smote
the orchardists’ bowling. A feature of me tSydney-
Waverley game was the Sydney batsmen's rash policy
of hitting the ball to S.vd Gregory aid rouping—
three wickets were given away thus. Sydney scraped
together 107 runs 'Cohen 21). Ives (ihiej for 4o)
and Hendry (four for 50) did all the bowling on a
perfect pitch, and it was a pleasure to watch Carter
behind the sticks. Waverley have lost two for 171
(Davis 77 and Kippax 53, both n. 0.). Gordoii outed
Balmain for 14!), Kellett (five for 40) doing most of
the destruction. For Gordon Tozer, consistency
itself, got 67, and Taylor banged together 77. ; Three
wickets have fallen for 203.
] I only aid Bowden gave a fine exhibition
for Pr’an v. Norths, in Melbourne district pricket
on Saturday. The former made 130 (n. 0.) without
a chance, and Bowden’s 81 was all merit. ; Six
P’ran wickets are down for 279. Ironmonger fowled
well for Melbourne v. ’Cote ; and the ordinarily
useful side was outed for 137. Four Mel!), wickets
arc down for 121 (Hansford, b. Hartkopf, 41 )i Con-
sistent all-round scoring was the feature of ’Saints
(280 for nine) against. ’Roy. Ponsford made 53, aril
tlolchin 52 in careful style. Richmond were all
out for 273 v. Easts, who then went and made 52
for none; and Souths, having retired ’Wood for: 209,
made 42 for one, the n.o. men being Gray and
Purvis. Uni. put up a miserable effort against
the Carlton bowling, Truman’s swerves, proving
deadly in collaboration with the high wind. The
students were dismissed for 93, whereupon Carlton
proceeded to collect 103 for six.
N.S.W. XI. to play Queensland next
week is a rattling team on present form. If
there is a fault it lies in its surplusage of veterans.
M. A. Noble will captain it, and among the bowlers
are R. Norman, A. Asher and Hendrey.
Andy Raidin'e will wicket-keep.
Of a total <>f .111 for six wickets, J. E.
Pratten (Sydney G.S.) made 212 v. Newington.
Last year lie got 52C runs and 20 wickets for 392.
In the same fixture, M. Hesslein (Grammar) col-
lected 100, and E. Newman (Newington) 101. in
the King’s School-St. Joseph match, of King’s 418
Hallida.v scored 121 and Watford 99 not out.
H. Myers, one-tirrie Yorkshire (Eng.)
professional, banged the first century in Tasmanian
cricket this season with 102 for Wellington v. Der-
went. The innings, included 21 fours.
Chuck Wiggins, the American, made his
first appearance in Australia at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night. He is a tall, fair, lathy customer
who fights just over the middleweight limit. George
Cook, who opposed him, weighed 13st. 21b., though he
is half a head shorter. Wiggins, unlike most Yanks,
is more a boxer than a fighter. He ha.s a nice
straight left and a snappy right cross, but there
was little weight behind the punches he landed on
tlie Australian. Cook, in point of fact, spurned
them and went after a knock-out. This he failed
to achieve, and at the end of the 20 rounds the
referee indicated Wiggins as the winner. The con-
test, though dull, was very even.
* * * *
The welters Brogan and Quendreux
met at Brisbane Stadium oil Saturday night. The
Gaul based his hopes of victory on a knock-out, but
the more-skilful Brogan easily eluded him, and at
the end of the 20 rounds "was winning by yards.
Even the ranks of Bolshevism, which are always well
represented in the Brisbane institution, could scarce
foroear to cheer the decision.
Last week. Arthur Baynes again landed
Queensland single-sculls championship on the Bur-
nett River. He was only 19 when he first took the
title a year ago. Time for the 2$ miles, I7min.

J. 11. Kirkwood staggered golfers on the
Omdeigh links (\ic.) last week with a round of
,■ Quit 011 “ b °gey,” and four strokes
letter than Jvo M hitton’s 1911 record. In the 36-
hole handicap he went round in 148, which won
the handicap and gross score. It looks as if the
t plonel needs an overhaul.

At the Government House Ball on the eve
of the Cup the military and naval men glit-
tered with decorations and all the Governors
were crusted with new gold lace. The G.-G.
looked slim in sashes and gold; Lieut.-
Governor Irvine wore a costume fresh from the
bandbox ; and their Exes. Davidson (N.S.W.),
Galway (S.A.) and Newdegate (Tas.)
sparkled in the throng. Jolly old Admiral
Grant pranced in the official set; also new
Chief Justice Adrian Knox, the Creswells
and the Chauvels. Mrs. Billy Hughes
danced with his Ex. of South Aus., while
hubby was away spell-binding constituents.
Everybody else but the heads stood round
and watched proceedings until the orchestra
drifted into a “Hesitation” ; then the dancing-
mad young folk began to glide. There are
no wallflowers these days, for those of the
men who dance at all are as keen as the girls.
Even old greyheads made their swallow-
tails fly. At one end of the ballroom was
an arrangement of gorgeous screens. From
behind these came sounds of ice tinkling in
glass. Lighted gardens and lounge corridors
opening on to the terrace drew romantic
young things from the ballroom.
Lady Helen’s dress Was tomato red with
big wallpaper patterns of gold on the
brocade. The purple sash of her Red Cross
order completed a gorgeous color scheme.
Diamonds sparkled in her tiara and danced
round her neck. It was a night of dia-
monds. The tall Miller dame added to her
height with her largest sky-sign. Mrs.
Bowes Kelly wore three rows of the gems
about her neck and each row was clasped
with a cluster. Mrs. Adrian Knox was a
graceful figure in black lace —and more
diamonds. The Irvine lady had feather
trimming on a black dress, while the Chauvel
dame shone in pink, gold and blue. Mrs.
Hughes had floating white chiffon on black
satin. Mrs. Victor Lansell (Bendigo)
scored with her tiara, the diamonds of which
were buttressed with pearls of great price.
Mrs. Everard Browne (the Chirnside
sister) sparkled like a frosty morning.
Peter Mcßride was an imposing sight in
full Windsor costume—white breeks, white
silk stockings and buckled shoes. None of
the other Court-dressed people had the nerve
to put ’em all on. Agent-General Peter-
looked like a plum)) bluff English gentle-
man of a century ago. He held a reception
of his own.
Mrs. George Chirnside caused a -sensation.
She still holds her own as a belle of Mel-
bourne. Just back from the other side of
the world, she wore a coral pink gown from
Paris. Two plain panels of silk from neck
to knee were slung from the shoulders with
ropes of pearls.
There were crowds of buds. Ula, daughter
of the Murray Mortons, made a second debut.
(First was at the Baillieus’ ball.) The
little Forsyth maiden emerged in white with
clover carnations and sweet-peas. Percy
Berry’s girl came under the wing of Mrs.
Sellheim. She wore some rich Honiton.
Sylvia, eldest of the IlennesSy trie, was
a plump, sweet debutante of 18. Her frock
was simple, and girlish.
For supper there was a gold-and-silver
service. It began with hot soup—-not a had
idea, because women never do take their din-
ner when dressing for a big shivoo. All the
other food was iced —cold birds and cold
bottles set among whole bushes of azaleas
in gilded flower-pots. The gardener had just
brought the conservatory indoors.
Parting guests had to be shooed along the
right track by worried footmen and aides.
Nearly everybody tried to return by the door
of entrance, whereas the way home was
through a winding gully of ferns with a
red carpet instead of moss. The carriage
business was managed unusually well: there
is, as a rule, an unholy scramble on the
portico steps.
The Chauvel dame came in for much notice,
mainly on account of her husband and her
own youth. There was a dearth of young
and pretty women, which may be why the
white-haired matrons appeared to such ad-
vantage—beginning with Lady Davidson,
Mrs. Geo. Chirnside and Mrs. William
Bates. Some exquisite frocks of brocade
were worn with alluring little trains. Tin?
Hodges widow managed to walk quite nicely
in a glittering jet sheath.
Mrs. John Lang was noticeable. Her
frock was vieux-rose brocade with rose-
flimsies edged with fur over all, some
precious rose diamonds on top. Mrs. Lang
goes to England soon to join her mother.
Mrs. Ross Soden also cast strong high lights
with her diamonds. She was in elaborate
white drapings. Son Gordon had his Eng-
lish bride. She was a slim little figure in
bridal white and pearls. Her special
homing dance happens at Grong Grong dur-
ing the week. Miss Byron Moore wore a
conspicuous frock, with stripes as wide as
those that adorn verandah-bln.d canvas.
The Australian Club Ball always scores
a win amongst the Cup fixtures, and Fri-
day night’s shivoo was no exception. The
high staircase, rich in amber-colored lights
and pink hollyhocks, made arriving guests
exclaim. The ballroom was lit with tur-
quoise-blue lights round which floated large
butterflies and amber flowers. The supper
rooms were a blaze of cerise and scarlet
rhododendrons. The G.-G. and Lady Helen
(in red and black brocade), the Sydney
vice-regals and the Irvines gave an air to
the junket. Many old pals met again after
years of war, and the entertainment got
well into its stride and never faltered. Mrs.
George Chirnside was elegant as ever in
delicate pink with a small tiara. Mrs. Nor-
ton Grimwade bound her locks in a startling
head-dress of yellow and black. Mis. Pat
Osborne was greeted with enthusiasm, and
looked well in pastel pink. The tall Mona
and Daisy Hay (Sydney) Stood out in the
throng, whilst just-returned Eileen Bell
(Q.) wore a coat dress of many cplors with
an ostrich-feather fan. Others present wer -
the Maoriland racing Steads, General C. B.
White and his spouse; Marie de Bavay, in
cerise chiffon, carrying a bunch of lilies of
the valley; General "Grimwade, with his
pretty wife and daughter; and Mrs. Herbert
Sargood, handsome in mole and black.
With a record Cup crowd, dressing for
the races was a useless expense and worry.
The only attention a Cup dress attracted
in the crush was when some man was try-
ing to apologise for having put his foot
through it. The owner of a well-fancied
horse in the big race came out in hpr year-
before-last tailor-made and sat on the ter-
race stairway like the weariest country
dame on the post-office steps. Buffets from
scrambling men’s boots had no effect on her,
for she had dressed for the crowd. Another
horse-owning dame had her prettiest toque
bashed over her eyes while she was lament-
ing the absence of the table linen from the
lunch hampers. Some women whose men-
folk owned gees took an hour to battle down
to the birdcage to see the animals, Grand-
standers who once got a seat stucK to it all
day. At lunch-time there were thermos-and-
sandwich picnics by the dozen on the stands.
Even the vice-regal pen was crowded.
Lady Helen covered up a grey ninon dress
with a black chiffon-velvet coat. The G.-G.
was muffled to the eyes iu a storm coat.
Lady Davidson snuggled into a satin coat
with an ermine collar. The bronze-tissue
hat of the Irvine dame was just visible, and
the grey feathers in Lady Helen’s lid swirled
madly in the breeze. Miss Eadith Walker
supported a pink rose hat above the waves
of millinery. Fringes, feathers and beads
were everywhere.
Most of the social heavyweights wore
their oldest boots. Vanity could have had
no worse defeat. Too much jazzing had
made their feet tender, so the best-buckled
high-heeled shoes were left at home.
The various Governors went to lunch in
a peaceful spot made gorgeous with carna-
tions and cheerful with champagne. Owen
Cox had a big lunch party under the elms,
likewise the Leslie Stuarts and the Leslie
Macdonalds. The Coopers also spread a
feast, and the Winter Irvings offered a
chicken bone to a big party of friends.
White muslin was favorite for the Oaks.
All sorts of delicate lingerie dresses drifted
out, with wonderful parasols overhead.
There were parasols with fringes, and gamps
with huge ivory knobs or rings above the
silk; Japanese parasols of brilliant colors,
and. occasionally, a huge awning of tussore,
with its old-time green lining; motor-para-
sols as big as half-crowns, and parasolettes
that folded up and disappeared into a
peggy-bag made of their own drapings.
Muslin and linen embroideries brought from
India were everywhere. A Banaiuilaiul
woman scored with her Indian muslin
patched daintily on to a black satin princess
petticoat. The hand-and-arm masseuses
had been busy for a fortnight getting
feminine upper limbs into trim for the short
sleeves. There are short “baby” sleeves
and wide, short bell-sleeves to choose from.
Theatre parties, later, showed a fine crop
of sunburn.
Oaks Day brought forth the best Locking
An attempt was made here and there to
introduce the Longchamps modes; but the
Australian sun scorched like a wowser the
women who will wear short sleeves and low-
necked dresses. A few no-stocking re-
formers were out on Cup Day.
Steeplechase day ended the Flemington
gallops on Saturday. A blazing hot day
brought out summer frocks, but crowds of
fagged women cut out the last day’s racing.
Lady Helen put in an appearance in cool
grey and white with a shady hat. Mrs.
Angus McPhail wore ivory georgette with
a shady pale-blue hat. Mrs. Williams (wife
of the Judge) paraded in a white frock and
a smart black hat. Pauline Curran, from
Hobart, fluttered in georgette and a huge
floral sash. Mrs. Tom Boyd had jade-green
touches on her white dress. Owen Cox’s
niece, Miss Bonsor. wore silver-grey from
hat to shoes. Cecily Catterall, of Sydney,
was over. I She belongs t our Western
District Laidlaw family.) Fiance Captain
Duncan was in attendance, and Mrs. Robert
Simpson did chaperon duty all through the
race season. Mrs. Jack Winter-Irving
dressed in the coolest of tussore. Mrs. John
Hunter wore almost uniform white. The
Frank Austins were amongst the big crowd,
and the Learmonths, of Hamilton, and Mrs.
Alister Clarke and the Claude Palmers, of
the Western District. Mrs. Archibald Fisken
arrived with the Government House party.
She is staying with her sister and Lieut.-
Gov. Irvine. Coralie Reid, also a visitor
with the Irvines, is over from the Apple
Island. The Airdlies, of Warrnambool, the
Donald McKinnons and the Bohemian Club
had luncheon parties.
This is nil ex-
cellent likeness of
Alexander Steven,
who has made a big
beginning in his
chosen art by win-
ning the hi g h ap-
proval of John Mase-
field, the Lon d o n
Atuen.3S.um; and other
authorities on Eng-
lish rhy m e. The
young singer, who is
a son of Dr. Steven,
of South Yarra, has
already issued three
slender volumes of
verse, and will
presently publ i s h
another, “Revolt,”
which strikes a
stronger and more defiant note.
The Paynes outdid all the other private
race-time dance-givers in lavish entertain-
ment. To start with, they put up a
Y.M.C.A. war-time hut in the garden for a
dancing pavilion, and supplied it with a
precious floor. All the other extravagances
of a smart dance piled up on top of that.
There were troughs of champagne. During
the frivol Marie Yencken’s engagement to
Ken Menzies was announced and toasted.
Sylvia Currie was one of the lucky dam-
sels whose parents gave her a coming-out
dance this Cup. She is a small, wax-doll of
a girl, and was wonderfully and elabo-
rately dressed in layer after layer of flimsy
ivory-white, heavily weighted with gold fili-
grees. She wore the marvel to the Govern-
ment House Ball later.
Menzies’ and the Oriental saw weird
sights at breakfast-time during the races.
Garments that society fashion-books call
“'matinees” were aired in the big dining-
rooms. The delighted wearers considered
their half-draped figures fit for publication
and appeared in pale chiffons meant for the
soft shadows of a bedroom.
Commander Wilkinson, of the Fna, cut
short his race-season and crossed to Sydney
to welcome his home-coming wife. The
pair had not met for five years.
The Hennessy dame adopted the Lady-
Mayoress, Mrs. Stein. She had her in charge
each race-day, and put her through her
facings.
There was sipping from glasses and
crunching of biscuits and lighting up of
cigars when the Melbourne City Council
(conveyed in five taxis) called on I.ieut.-
Governor Irvine to ask him to have an offi-
cial look at Aikman, the new Gaud-Mayor.
His Ex. saved the council the trouble of
going all the way to .Malvern by receiving
the party at the vice-regal offices at the Old
Treasury. He referred in a remote sort of
way to the soreness felt at Cabena’s defeat,
and expressed the hope that Aikman would
get the full backing of the council. Cabcna
had to present Aikman. and, of course, the
new G.-M. said something soothing. No
robes, cocked hats, ruffles or dog-chains were
worn by anybody, and . there was nothing
(the taxis excepted) to distinguish the
crowd from a deputation from the Piscatorial
Society.
The G.-G. and fellow-wo: ker Newdegate
blew in unofficially to the Rose Society's
show at the Town Hall. The G.-G. was
immediately pounced upon and asked to
‘“open” the exhibition, but passed the honor
on to Newdegate, whom he introduced as "a
gardener and a country gentleman.” The
rural gent., who looks more like a city dia-
mond merchant, expressed doubt whether
there were any readers of Francis Bacon in
the audience, and advised those present to
mitigate their ignorance by perusing the old
gentleman’s essay on gardens. Those who
had not heard of Francis since their school-
days applauded politely, while a minority
looked hurt.
Another of the soldier IV ilsons, Lieut.
Andrew, is home again at Farnham Lark.
Wilson was one of the first four 1914 volun-
teers from the Warrnambool district, and
he has been in all sorts of services horse,
foot, bike and machine-gun. Dr. Grattan
Wilson, the father of the fighting family, re-
turned from overseas duty earlier in the
yea?.
The son-in-law-elect of General Monash
has just arrived home in Melbourne from
the wars. lie is Dr. Gershon Bennett, who
went to America before the war to study
the latest ideas in dentistry, and cut over
to France from there. Fiancee Bertha is
due home with her mother and father in
December. She had a joyous time in Lon-
don, and says that all her smartest invita-
tions included “a dancing partner.” A
young aviator cousin, who can dance as
well as he can fly, acted as escort.
The opera on Saturday night was delighted
by a sideshow supplied by a tall, upstanding
Toorak girl. It seems that, after buying an
expensive seat, the girl was forced to sit in
the gallery. She plumped herself down in
full evening kit in the aisle. When asked
by John Hop to move she refused, and in
the altercation that followed she boxed the
ears of the patient but protesting bobby.
The gallery gave her rounds of applause.
Adelaide’s week : —-
Mrs. Rattigan, who was the Anzac Buffet’s super-
intendent for four years, was the guest of the
Cheer-Up Society while the Osterley was at the
Outer Harbor. She was welcomed at the Hut and
then motored through the hills. The Cheer-Up Hut,
by the way, is to close at Christmas, and its fifth
and final birthday was celebrated on Saturday by
a huge picnic to Belair, to which about 4000 Diggers
and their womenkind turned up. Another of its last
flutters was to arrange for Christmas trees for the
children at the soldier settlements on the Murray.
A surprise has come from London in the announce-
ment that Max Anderson is engaged to Miss Edith
Wanton, of Chippenham.
Ex-Premier Crawford Vaughan's wanderings have
carried him to Cologne, where he reports “every-
thing as peaceful as though 19X4-18 were a dream
and industries getting hack into their old stride.”
The H. L. Conrans have booked passages from
England to Egypt at the end of the year, and plan
to come on to Australia later. Son Eric is still doing
military duty in England. The J. W. Bakewells are
also coming for a trip, and are due before! Christ-
mas. Abe Shannon sailed from London at the end
of last month.
From Bananaland comes news of the death of J.
Haddocks Hughes, one of the Bristow Hughes clan,
who went to the northern State from England about
00 years ago. He was married to a cousin, the
second daughter of the late Herbert Bristow Hughes.
There are two small children.
A meat strike has converted us to compulsory
vegetarianism, or tinned stuff. Plutocrats may eat
roosters at 6s. 6d., and turkey at 2s. a pound
(auction prices).
Barbara South, of Rosebank, Mount Pleasant, is
engaged to Ronald, son of the Broken Mill Hcrwoods.
Max Pirani, who is here caught by Lafay-
ette. was only 12 when be won the regard
of Carreuo. and three years later lie was
surprising other listeners with the quality
of liis Petite Suite
anti other piano com-
positions. A scholar-
ship in 1911 thrust
the brilliant youth
under the notice of
Edouard Seharf,
Ernest Toy and tlr?
late Marshall Hall,
and after two or
three years’ train-
ing he slipped off to
England and
America, playing
with Vogr i C h,
Godowsky, Mischa
Elman and Rudolph
Ganz. Max’s chosen
instrument is the
piano, but he also
plays the violin, and
liis work in composition has already laid
the foundation of a separate reputation.
After several attempts to get into khaki he
enlisted for the A.I.F. in America in 1918,
and got to the Front just before the Armis-
tice was signed.
Another of the Silvesters, of Coleraine,
has bowed his head to the halter of matri-
mony. This time it is Eric, the youngest
son of the late Eugene Silvester, whose pri-
vate vaults bulged with the testaments
and assorted securities of the Western Dis-
trict’s leading families. The bride is Hilda
Carew. , , .
Fenleigh Boyd, who has planted Ins camp-
stool at Warrandyte. got cheerful news from
the Felton Bequest Trustees last week. It
was to the effect that his brilliant study of
wattle, christened “The Breath of Spring,
had been bought for 200 guineas.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
DAVEID
JONES
for
SMART
MILLINERY
“It s Eastward Ho to Spain!” says the
American Consular Nortons, she a smartly-
tailored, small-hatted brunette; he much
fairer, with the eyes of a poet and the
tongue of a raconteur that deny everything
of the hustling American we know. From
Malaga they came as direct to Sydney as
they could, and find something in our sun-
shine and blue skies to recall the five years
spent in their castle in Spain, which was
really an apartment of 14 rooms, with
marble floors and pillars, balconies and high
windows, overlooking the Mediterranean.
At Malaga the days pass in a deep peace
and happy ease. If a man prospers well,
it is the will of God. If ill-fortune puts its
hand upon his shoulder —well, that is God s
will, too, and nothing can be done about
it. II a thing cannot be done to-day- —well,
is there not a lifetime of to-morrows? So
everybody goes about his work singing. The
maid chirps at her household tasks; the
laborer airs his tenor or baritone as he
lays brick upon brick; the factory-girls
no Carmens these, many of them middle-
aged—hum little tunes as they come from
the big building into the warm evening,
invariably stopping to exchange a small
copper with the flower-seller for a yellow
or red bloom to fasten in the hair. All
Spain is color and light and music and a
princely hospitality —the hospitality that
with a gesture as free as the air offers a
share of its mid-day meal, mostly bread and
a kind of sausage, to whoever passes,
whether the passer be prince or pauper. In
higher circles the host flings wide his house
to you, taking care never to use the posses-
sive '‘my” to his guest. On Sundays the
city empties itself into orange groves or olive
groves. Early in the morning they set out,
mother, father and family. If they have a
donkey and cart they drive ; if they have no
donkey—well, they walk, greeting all they
meet with “Go with God.” Should a stranger
pass when the picnic meal is in progress
why, was not the party prepared for him !
The child is King in Spain. You don’t
pass one in the street without stopping to
greet it; men will clamber from carts to
pat an infant on the head and murmur a
blessing. Everywhere is the Moorish influ-
ence still felt —in the retired life of the
women ; in the architecture of the old houses,
built on a level with the street, with shut-
tered windows and barred doors. From with-
out they are grim; but it is different once
the balconies overlooking the gardens and
courtyards are reached; for this Spaniard
builds his house about his garden, not his
garden about his house.
Then (there’s always a catch in it!)
there are the barrel-organs; crops of
them; barrel-organs in every quarter. Ihe
arrival of one at a corner is the signal foi
the children to foregather. Little girls
hastily drape a gay-colored —nearly always
red or yellow—scarf about hip or shoulder,
thrust a flower in the hair, and there in the
warm dust little bare feet step through old
Spanish dances. Sometimes there is the
clash of castanets; and in the narrow street
steeped in sunlight the small girl with Mow-
ing face and eyes, with flower-decked head
and gay scarf, symbolises the nation s quick
responsiveness to simple gladness.
The bull-fight is still the great social
event of the year. For it women leave
their seclusion; and for days beforehand
the pawnshops drive a roaring trade, since
your Spaniard will sell his dearest god
rather than miss a good view of the toreador
from Cordova or Seville. For at Seville
and Cordova are the two schools of bull-
fighting. quite distinct in their methods,
where the bull-fighter is as carefully trained
as a ballet-girl is elsewhere. Should he in
the ring display any awkwardness or false
judgment lie is met with a tornado of hisses.
It is for the bull-fight in Easter Week and
for Holy Week that the Spanish women lays
aside her English hat and the wide black
shawl that usually eclipses her charms, and
once more emerges with her rich tresses
adorned with high combs and lace mantilla,
and her national dress fashioned in bright
hues. Then indeed the streets are resplendent
with her magnolia-skinned, midnight-haired
beauty; and here and there, in high relief
against her brunette sisters, steps a red-
haired, green-eyed girl from Aragon, with
her arched instep and unconscious insolence
of bearing.
These and many more memories are
packed in the dream corner of the Nortons
hearts —memories of bright-hued flowers
a-bloom everywhere; of the visitor who
enters your home with a “Peace be Here,
and leaves it with “Remain with God” ; of
the most delicious cookery in the world; of
the wonderful gestures by which men and
women carry on conversation without a
spoken word; of a land that the domestic
problem has not touched, and where the jazz
and the cabaret are unknown; where women
wajk in modesty, and men guard the honor
of their homes.
A son arrived at the Rupert Clarke house-
hold last week. Dropped in, carrying 101 b.
weight, the morning after the Cup and the
one before the wedding anniversary. Pre-
sent decision is to name him Rupert. So
all the luck wasn’t with Sam Hordern.
The Sam Hordern clan made the Went-
worth merry over dad’s double win at the
Cup. The lady honored Artilleryman’s speed
in black sequined net, and daughter Doreen
was in white. (The other win was in Tatt.’s.)
This is Judith Fletcher’s picture of Mrs.
Hedley Parsons, artist, Australian born and
trained, with Julian Ashton and Sid Long as
artistic godfathers. A
constant exhibitor at
the Society of
Artists, Mrs. Par-
sons is a best-seller
in colors. The sea
and tall ships lure
her above all else,
though the blossom
of Castle Hill seems
to touch a chord as
well. At the present
Exhibition of the
Women Painters, in
“Derelicts a t Bal-
main” and “Blos-
som” she shows two
striking examples of
the different calls to
her brush and brain.
Gallery Trustee Sul-
man purchased “Rose Rush” for his own,
and that was the first private sale made from
the Exhibition.
The Gallery adds Mrs. Sherwood’s “Banjo
Girl” and “Reflections” to its treasures.
The girl is a delightful creature dressed in
a wonderful shade of blue and not ashamed
to disclose a pair of very shapely legs, She
is strongly suspected of having mounted the
white stool with guileful design of showing
off the blue of her dress and the afore-
mentioned limb. Maybe she’s after a place
among the ten beautiful girls the Tivoli
is searching for. There’s another bit of
news about Mrs. Sherwood that mustn’t be
mentioned till next week.
Jean Hartt was the model for the very
fine bit of bronze, “The V,A.,” exhibited at
the Women Painters’ show by Betty
Solomon, whose clever fingers have also
created a Laughing Girl, and all the
time one looks at her you think of
a line of David Wright’s that speaks of
“laughter in a woman’s throat.”
At Holy Trinity Church, Dulwich Hill,
on November 1, Raymond Cook, son of
Mrs. S. Cook, of Lismore, endowed with all
his worldly goods promising singer Dorothy
Gill. (The Bulletin showed her picture
not so very long ago.) White georgette,
with a pink tulle train, an embroidered veil
and a bouquet of orchids, comprised the
bridal array. Sister Hilda and sister-in-law
Millie followed in frocks of pink georgette
and hats of black tulle. Master James Jack-
son breathed “The Voice,” and Ada Baker
(the proud teacher of the bride) warbled
“Because.”
Captain Gilbert Nobbs, back in Sydney
with his pretty little wife and two children,
is at the Coogee Hotel until the Holbrook
factories materialise under his supervision.
Captain Nobbs still has his brother blinded-
soldier’s interests at heart, and what he
cannot puzzle out just now is why, although
wages boards, etc., are constantly lifting the
living wage, owing to climbing costs, the
maimed soldier’s pension doesn’t automati-
cally increase. Since his last stay in Syd-
ney the Captain has travelled 45,000 miles
(meeting with only one slight accident by
the way, and that the matter of a crushed
finger-tip) to inquire into trade conditions,
and is firmly of opinion that Australia is
the place for him as far as industry is con-
cerned. He marvels as much at the price
of food here as at the tricks of the profiteer
in England. The Food Comptroller one
mousing announced that eating potatoes
were co he sold at per lb. and seed
potatoes at 3d. That afternoon there wasn’t
a potato in England that was not “seed.”
Major “Jack” Scott, D. 5.0., and his wife
got back on the Osterley. They were mar-
ried in England in 1917. He is a nephew of
Rose Scott, and went away early in 1915.
The Goulburn Peace Ball, where a
fruitless effort was made to get W. M.
Hughes to dance, was a sort of pre-
liminary canter to the Tiranna Race
Ball. The Tiranna meeting, which lapsed
during the war, will suffer from the absence
of many regular patrons, notably the Alec
Dalgleishs, of Pomeroy, but the heads are
determined that it shall be better and
brighter than ever. Bong Bong is also to
be revived —with the inevitable ball in Moss
Vale.
Rita King, of Barraba, left last week for
Canada, where she will marry airman
Mclvor. The couple first met in England
when bride-to-be was in the thick of war
work.
The Osterley brought Jack Ryrie, who
left his herds in the Warren district to
enlist in the first year of the war. Also his
sister Mrs. Amphlett, whose husband was
killed in battle three weeks after their mar-
riage in England.
A cable brought Mrs. Fred Jolley to Syd-
ney to meet her husband. Here she got
another cable that he had been obliged to re-
turn to his English hospital for a further
operation, so he can’t be here before Feb-
ruary. Fred Jolley was British Consul at
Rabaul, and was taken prisoner by the Huns.
Being released, he came to Sydney, and en-
listed. He’s son of Mrs. M. R. Marsh, a Mel-
bourne Red Cross light. Mrs. J. R. Moore,
the lgindsome widow of Moorelands, Moree,
is an, aunt. Mrs. Jolley 'is a smart New
Yorker, and hopes to leave for America with
Tier husband in February.
Pity Marie Segur did not choose a Car-
men number for her programme last week
at the King’s Hall. For a more handsome
Carmen has not been on a Sydney concert
platform. She looked the part in blaclt
with a lacy tunic embroidered in Crimson.
This mezzo-soprano has dramatic ability and
artistic perception. An aria from “Ruy
Bias,” a trio of dainty Bergerettes, and
"Chanson Arabe” (Bemberg) were among
her offerings. Violinist Frederick Lochiel,
who claimed the other half of the pro-
gramme, showed promise, but he scarcely
picked a winner in the Mendelssohn con-
certo. George Whitehead added his baritone
to the programme.
Among Saturday’s private-viewers of the
Women Painters’ Art show were the Arthur
Allens and the Ken Austins, and, of course,
dame Melba’s sister, Mrs. Box.
Maoriland visitors to Sydney include W.
J 11. Sedgly, of Christchurch, who has
been talking business, of course. When he
gets home it will be as managing director of
the Maoriland section of the big Bennett
and Wood motor business.
Lieut.-Col. Kingscote, who is to captain
the Davis Cup tennis team in Australia, was
married a few weeks before he left for
these parts. He is bringing his wife with
him.
For at least three generations Skinners
and Christians have been christened, con-
firmed and wedded at St. Mark’s, Da "ling
Point, and the.habit has grown strong upon
them. So one afternoon last week, having
an appointment at a church, Mrs. Antill,
who was a Christian, naturally walked up
the old aisle, which was banked with arum-
i.es from porch to altar-step. Never has
church been more lavishly beflowered, the
bride’s women friends starting their labor
of love at half-past seven in the morning
and finishing at ten.
In soft grey
draperies topped by
a black bat, her
hands fi 11 e d with
orchids and lilies of
the valley grown at
Wahroonga, Mr s.
Antill changed her
name once more, and
will henceforth be
looked up as Mrs. F.
G. Sargood. The
bridegroom, who had
donned white spats
for the occasion, was
best-manned by his
brother Percy.
Padres Howard Lea
and Canon Beck
blessed the match,
while a churchful of
wellwishers sang “The Voice” in several dif-
ferent keys; and six-foot 16-year-old son
Jack Antill helped to see the wedding
through.
Tudor, the old Christian home which is to
be the new Sargood menage, had its great
drawing-room overlooking the Harbor fur-
nished for the reception, and here again the
clever hands of women friends under the
direction of Mrs. Meares and Miss Part-
ridge, with the resources of Raynor’s behind
them, had been so busy arranging miles of
asparagus fern and pink carnations that the
entrance and the stairway gave no hint of
their as yet unfurnished state. There were
Ewens, of the Maoriland end of the firm,
present to see the knot-tying; Christians
galore; the two Skinner aunts; and Mrs.
Toohey and the Richard Meareses were a
few of the 60 or so who drank the toasts.
Mrs. Edward Noyes is giving the very
smartest little dances in Sydney these days.
Before pretty Helena Noyes grew up. the
family lived in a smallish house at Point
Piper, next door to the Neville Dangars.
Their Darling Point place is much bigger,
and is better suited for entertaining.
From a homing xVustralian: —
Among the miscellaneous assortment of dead heads
travelling to Aussie by the Osterley, on which, by
the way, are Dame Reid and Robert Muirhead Col-
lins, is Senator Pearce, with his wife, family, secre-
tary and messenger. The Senator, smugger than ever,
has given some entertaining lectures to the Diggers
and their, wives, on Russia, Repatriation, etc. These
have earned for him the title of “C.C.1.1.” —“Com-
plete Compendium of Inaccurate Information.” Miss
Pearce, notwithstanding her presentation at Bucking-
ham Palace, returns engaged to a mere “two-star
artist” —Lieut. Ellison, a 1918 Duntroon graduate.
A Kentucky tea is one where every
woman pays, and numerous American and
Australian friends foregathered on the Ken-
tucky plan at the Pekin Cafe to assure Con-
sul Brittain’s wife that they simply hated
to lose her. There was an air of gaiety
about the party that may have been born of
the fact that every second woman was sport-
ing her latest millinery. The Figmans added
the family good looks to the tea table; and
Mrs. Brittain flung wit and repartee over
a high decorative basket which the origina-
tors of the spree had handed her.
The National Council of Women has had
a solemn talk, and woollen comforters and
chest-protectors are to replace the sunburned
throat and bare breast-bone of Sydney’s
Summer girl
No longer may the passenger on ferry or on tram
Be gladdened by sly glances at a ribbon-strapped
lace cam;
And a pinkly-gleaming forearm, through ninon or
georgette,
Is a thing that any moral male will rapidly forget;
The plump and shapely near-silk calf
Will be cut down by nearly half;
The fleecy skirt that tips the knee
Must by five inches let down be.
And vampire girls who stalk their prey
In offices the livelong day
Must mr>' n in uniform more meek,
And never laugh and never speak.
Oh, Sydney’s much too glad—
They’re sure it must be bad!
Come let us all be good and sad!
In spite of the high cost of potatoes St.
Andrew’s Soldiers’ Welcome Hut still keeps
its doors open. The members of the Ladies’
Home Mission keep the kettle boiling all day
and every day, and it is nothing for them
to serve between 300 and 500 meals before
they go home. On Sundays there’s an
additional invitation afternoon tea. Friday
is Mrs. Archgaiters Wright’s day at the
stove, and with sleeves half-mast she bakes
and brews from morn till dewy eve. Mrs.
Scrivener is another of the Welcome’s pil-
lars of strength.
Miss Montefiore, who lives at Kirribilli
when she is not at the old-paper depot or
taking an interest in some Movement, is off
to England to join her sisters, loitering in
Italy or the South of France until the Eng-
lish spring is thoroughly aired.
Mary Murdoch, of the brown hair and the
gentle manner, just returned from London,
where she was quietly efficient as accountant
in the London Office of the Prisoners of
War, is to marry her Lieut. Johnson before
the month is out.
Coming back to Sydney, Mrs. Mordaunt
Reid and her two sisters, who were nursing
in military hospitals during the w r ar.
Present intention of the three is to open a
private hospital. Mrs. Mordaunt Reid
helped Miss Chomley look after our boys
imprisoned in Germany, and was reckless in
the matter of adding an extra cake of soap
or packet of smokes to the prisoner’s parcel.
It was she who went out and bought the
red hanky that one man in Northern Ger-
many asked for in place of the everlasting
khaki. It was against sub-section 12,999
of the Regulations, but Mrs. Mordaunt Reid
said that, even if the Constitution got
hysterics, the man was to have the red wipe
his nose craved for. Later the Aussies
told them the ultimate fate of the rag.
When the Revolution burst there was a
shortage of red material, so this handkerchief
was commandeered and hoisted above the
prison to show that all within were in favor
of liberty.
There were Y.W.C.A. dryads on the lawn
at Ascham last Saturday; and the old bit
of Darling Point was made more attractive
by graceful girls in flowing draperies per-
forming the pageant, “The Wayside Piper,”
written by Mary Edgar. It is an adaptation
from old-friend Pied Piper, only this time
the tune he plays is all of Faith and Hope
and Love, with the girlhood of the world for
his audience. The classic steps and pos-
tures of the dances were very charming; and
the pale pinks and blues, the wliites and
browns of the draperies must have given the
real dryads that live in the old tree by the
lawm something to think over.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
A'o notice (except oj a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
.Vi me and address must appear on the MSS. So
liability is undertaken rc contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will .be returned
unless stamps accompany.
R. 0.8.: Your theory, to put it shortly,
appears to be that no manager should buy an Aus-
tralian play until Australians do something equa
to Shakspeare or Pinero ; and nobody should buy an
Australian picture unless it is by Rembrandt;> and
we shouldn't have sent an Australian commander to
the war because he wasn’t Hannibal; and we
shouldn’t go into the water until we can swim like
Captain Webb. As regards pianos, you claim that
it is no use encouraging the infant Australian in-
dustry because it will be “hundreds of years” be-
fore our piano is like your favorite foreign one.
How many hundreds of years? And how do you
know? Paul Cupid: “A Hay of Drought” is not.
vivid Willis V. W.: Threadbare G.L.M.: “The
Micks” fell into the basket. IM.P D. Pickett:
“The Bush Born” is carelessly handled, but there is
an idea in it; also there is no regulation or man-
date to stop you from having another go at it....
W.J.S.: Sketch is of no interest Howard K.:
“Mulgaland” not taken up. Neither are the other two
selections... .Jackv Roo: Poor stuff... .A. 8.: “The
Real Spring Song” hasn’t got a bright note in it,
but it might go with a bagpipe accompaniment....
E.McM.: It would make a hit at a Band of Hope
rally, especially' the line “I listened to my entrails
talk.”.. .’.Claudius: “Cakes” very doughy.... Dub
IOU: The only part of it we understood was “Sic
transit gloria mundi.”. . . . Ceff: Did you mean it for
us or Baby Bunting’s Annual ?.... Riverina : Your
note made it appear as if it were a copy of one of
the Diggers’ songs. Anyway, it, wasn’t up....
Quirk: No space to acknowledge pars. Glad to get
anything like the air item. . . .J.: Blame his own
press, lad. London Sportsman (25/3/’l9) refers to
Edwards as “born in England, but of Welsh parents
on both sides.”. .. .W.E. (West Maitland): There
is nothing in the Federal Constitution to prevent
p liticians buying sectional votes out of revenue,
o.' (a commoner method) by pledging the country’s
ci (lit. It is the basis of all Party Government....
Oliver: Vivid account of the unfortunate affair: —
We never were very rich, said Grace,
Therefore we could never run the pace;
Tom always kept a horse to race;
Of course there were other things to face.
Although Tom swears that his mare must win,
As he told his jock, Sullevin,
Put your boots and spurs, all your tin,
For y r ou will never forget when she comes in.
Of course Grace, too, was in the know,
That the mare was going to have a go ;
She ticked a bonnie new hat to show,
Thinking she would pay on the morrow.
No ! They never forgot when she came in,
All their hopes and everything;
She fell, injured her shin-
That was the end of the racing.
.. .Pre-natal: Not enough force for that sort of thing.
....Cora D.: Sorry r , but “My Secret” must remain
yours. .. .Clive W.: Verses composed like some women
walk —one foot in and one foot out T.Mc.: The
bawls of the cart-hawkers are not less understandable.
.... Laurie: You’ve a lot to learn still about verse ;
and one of the first lessons is to present the copy in
decent shape F.R.R.: Yarn no use....N.L. (Wel-
lington) : Sonnet wasn’t worth while, and is poor
in shape A.L. (Bathurst): Nothing there....
H.G.8.: It makes us feel something like the second
stanza.... AV. A. G.: “Xu San” neither trips nor
sings A.F.R.: Not for us C.D. (New Town)!
There isn't enough in “Here.”... .F.J.G.: Too tug-
ged, and its pre-war interest doesn’t give it life....
AA.P.B.: Very poor verse, mostly about nothing....
P.F. (Brunswick): Thin little ripple. .. .T.A.T.: In-
sane fragment rejected Walnut: “Statistics” has
a charm of its own:—-
Say the ladies of fashion in language quite charming,
this reduction in the birth-rate is really alarming ;
I think that the country it is certainly harming,
i °r to rear babies is quite as important as farming.”
But the workers, whose pozzies arc usually humble,
bay, If you d do your duty thcrc’d be no need to
grumble,
Vou take fine care that no babies with vour pleasures
jumble,
So, good afternoon, madam, we’ve taken a tumble.”
....Venture: Not up N.T. (Brisbane): Don’t like
Sonata”... .J.A.W.: Still the “doth thinketh,”
which is another man's copyright. .. .A.A. (Newing-
ton) : If it were suitable, which it isn't, it's a fur-
long too long. ...G.E.C.: Interesting, if historical,
but the telling should be improved... .0.G.P.: It is
nearly bad enough to be wicked. .. .K. 11. (Kew) :
H ouldn t have it even if an archbishop recommended
it Head Teacher: No lift or brightness John
F- : No use.... J.R.M.: Not badly told; but it’s a
boy’s yarn, and it wants a man’s knowledge of de-
tails to give it life.... Hickory: Verse hasn’t the
quality needed F.R.M.: Couldn’t Westerner .
“The Fire of Vouth” burns in the basket A.G.M.:
No use M.8.P.: “Birth Land’ misses A.R.T.:
Not for u5....M.N. (Condobolin) : Too thin and
trail to matter. .. .L.A.M.: Verse so bumpy that we
felt bruised all over after reading it... .8.5.D.M.:
Next time use your little boat to ferry vou some
more rhymes V.A.F.: It doesn't sing as a thing
Ike that should. .. .H.G.C.: Say it in prose and see
what it all amounts to J.H. (Glebe): Doesn’t
thrill us Tas: It wasn’t far short of that amount.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
P.J.C.: Art in agony. Take it away T.H.: It
goes home again C.V.R.: Not for U5....5.R.:
One of the senior residents of the Home for Old
Jokes. Aou can t draw yet. . . .11.T.H.: No use for
it M.F.: AA e don’t buy any like that. Beware
of drink and old jests G.R.: Too crude. Study.
. ...C.A.M.: You’re not hatched yet.
In the course of the N.S.W. Wheat in-
<]i)irv one witness explained certain of his
bank deposits as the proceeds of his hen
farm. Then his manager was called, and
said that the year’s takings of the farm were
£9OO or so, which, of course, accounted for
a lot of deposits. But his remark that the
outgoings were about £990 suggested, in an
irrelevant sort of way, a very gloomy draw-
ing of cheques against the deposits. It also
sets one wondering how these returned hen-
farming soldiers are getting on. When an
experienced professional hennist, working on
a big scale and with an expert manager (who
got first £3 and then £4 a week, henning not
being a high-wage industry), was glad to
lose only £9O in a year, these amateurs should
haA 7 e some stories to tell.

Rexona for Surfers
Beautiful Miss Beryl Ferguson is a favorite
with everyone. Her bright manner always en-
sures her a warm welcome. Miss Ferguson
joins the Rexona Girls with the following
words:
“I want you to know that I am a
Rexona Surfing Girl: I simply love surf-
ing, and am so fond of it that I often go
in when the sun is strongest, but I never
have any had effects from surfing, for I
always use Rexona before going in. I
rub some on my face and hands and I
never get sunburnt nor my skin affected
in any way. After my surf is over I
always have a cake of Rexona Soap which
I use in the shower on my hair
and skin, and I find by the use of
Rexona and Rexona Soap any girl
can keep herself quite as fresh
and dainty when surfing as she
could by missing all this fun and
always thinking of her com-
plexion.
“Among my girl friends I find
more and more of them using
Rexona every day, and I am glad
to write and tell you what ex-
cellent things Rexona and Rexona
Soap are for surfers.
“Delightedly yours,

To minimise the after-effects of sunburn, anointing with Rexona the Rapid Healer is
all that is necessary, and the skin soothed and cooled with its wonderful influence will quickly
regain its normal temperature and comfortable coolness. Rexona Skin and facial Soap will
be found excellent in combination with Rexona the Rapid Healer, and unequalled for all skiu

The most serious question confronting the lorry owner today is the
rising cost of maintenance. Only a lorry with the mechanical excellence
of the Federal Motor Lorry can operate month after month without

The durability, efficiency and low operating cost of the Federal give
it a notable standing among lorry owners who have studied the problems

Followed in savage harbors

And mated dark-skinned women,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MR. Acting-Depu ty-Assista nt-Com mis-
sary-General Pilkington had settled
down in the position which his father
had obtained for him in the Civil Establish-
ment of New South Wales, by favor of his
friend Earl Bathurst, Secretary of State for
the Colonies, and now the serious problem
confronted him of securing the services of
some person who could be depended upon
to valet him with efficiency. He felt that
he could know neither peace of mind nor
ordinary comfort of living until this pressing
requirement "was satisfied.
Mr. Pilkington has been mentioned before
as being no ordinary young man of the sort
that assisted in the governance of Aus-
tralia in the earlier years of the nineteenth
century. There were army subalterns and
young naval officers who were very typical
of the services to which they belonged. And
there w r ere junior civil servants of the kind
that might have been found in any quan-
tity in the Custom House, the Mint, the
Royal Dockyards or the Post Office at home
in England. Not many of them, it is true
—because so much highly efficient clerical
material was to be found amongst the con-
victs —but enough to constitute a small class
of its own in Sydney. And, as might have
been expected, they were a very average lot
of young gentlemen—they would hardly have
been found in this outlandish part of the
world had it been otherwise.
But Mr. Arthur Moorefield Pilkington was
not of the average sort —most distinctly
not. Everyone realised that, including Mr.
Pilkington and his fellow civil servants. For
one thing, as a condition of an exile that
was designed for his own good, he was in
receipt of a generous allowance from his
father, Mr. Alderman Pilkington. He was
unique, without a peer, almost a class by
himself. A Corinthian, an exquisite, a
blade, a blood, a buck —he was the only
one of his kind to be found south of the
equator. He had, as it were, risen over
the horizon of Sydney like a new sun.
Almost literally, he shone upon the some-
what drab and sordid social w T orld which
rejoiced and gloried in his illumination be-
side the shores of Port Jackson. The efful-
gence he radiated was one of the most
notable things about 1816—the year which
had been rendered remarkable by his advent
to the colony. He brightened, so to speak,
the whole prospect of the period.
The landing of Mr. Pilkington’s baggage
from the cabin and hold of the ship in
which he arrived had been in itself a notable
event. From its quantity not a few people
were led to believe that he had some in-
tention of starting in trade. Not less than
three wherryfuls of his personal property
had. with some demur on the part of the
Naval Officer, been passed through the Cus-
toms as such. It made a great stack of
trunks and packing-cases that stood as high
as the sentry-box at the landward end of the
King’s Wharf, and it was with no small
difficulty that door-space could be found for
it in the Stores until its owner should be
able to select a lodg.ng suitable to his
requirements.
It was. an item of news. Mr. Georg.
Ilowe paragraphed it in the Sydney Gazette
in this wise :—-
We have noted with feelings of Gratification cir-
cumstances connected with the arrival of a Gentle-
man of Position in the Civil Establishment of the
Colony that must afford satisfaction to all who take
pride in the Proper Appreciation of the Status of
Society in this Settlement. The fact that one who
has moved in the verv best Circles of Polite Society
at home should deem our infant capital not un-
worthy of the Standard of Ifefinement to which he
has been accustomed, is a matter for congratulation,
not only to the New Arrival in our midst, but equally
so to the already-settled Inhabitants of this part of
the realm. It is to be hoped that this gentleman’s
Good Example, in bringing with him to these shores
the Essentials of Refinement so necessary to the con-
duct of Life in the position he has been accustomed
to ornament in the Great Metropolis, will be fol-
lowed by future arrivals in our midst. The time
has come when the rough and material evidences
incidental to the Pioneering of a new Settlement
should be to some extent replaced by. those Elegancies
of Civilisation which mark an appreciation of its
Blessings.
Everyone who read the Gazette knew to
whom this manifestation of its editorial ap-
preciation referred, and it is a tribute to Mr.
Pilkington’s personality that most of them
agreed with it. Moreover, Government
House itself, in the person of Mrs. Mac-
quarie, had been interested, and
But this is the story of Mr. Pilkington’s
valet, rather than of the magnificent raiment
and furnishings wfith which he enriched Syd-
ney, and, as good Mr. Howe put it, blessed
the civilisation of the New World in the
South.
So we come to William Larkins, who, out
of several possibilities fastidiously and criti-
cally examined by Mr. Pilkington, was
chosen to iill this important, exacting and
delicate position.
Out of a somewhat varied succession of
more or less impossible applicants Mr. Pil-
kington had with some misgiving selected a
possible three. A West Indian negro, a
Cockney and a Frenchman had been told to
present themselves on Sunday afternoon at
the cottage near Dawes’ Battery where he
had installed liimslf with his splendid rai-
ment, his furniture, his books and all his
elegance-—a neat residence with a passable
garden that had once been occupied by the
gentleman who had given liis name to the
neighboring section of the defences of Syd-
ney Cove.
He had bidden to this important function
his new friends Ensign Patrick Calder, of
the 40th, and Lieutenant Gregory Wicks, of
11.M.5. Emu. They were to assist the
Court’s judgment in the capacity of asses-
sors, so to speak. The three young gentle-
men, having well and truly dined, occupied
chairs on the grass plat before the cottage,
smoking long churchwarden pipes, and en-
joying the pleasant prospect of the blue
waters of the harbor, the wooded hills that
enclosed them, and the brilliant sunlight
that enhanced their incomparable beauties.
“What ith your name, mv good fellow—
Pompey, I thuppothe?” asked Mr. Pilking-
ton of the big West Indian. “A likely
figure for livery!” he murmured to his com-
panions. “Plum-colored A-with yellow aigu-
letteth, eh, what?”
“Horatio Nelson O’Riordan, yT Honor.”
replied the negro with an ingratiating grin
Not Pompey, massa—named after A’mirai
Nelson, sail. Great a’mirai, sail ! Verv
good cook, massa.”
“Do you underthtand the care of a gentle-
man’th wardwobe, Horwatio?”
“Puffectly, sah.”
“Good. And why are you here, Hor-
watio?”
‘I done come hyah, sah, becos you done
tell me do so, sah—for to take dis hyah
job. I”
“No, no, Horwatio —you mithappwehend.
Why were you twanthported ? That ith
what I with to know.”
“What did they lag you for, you black
thief?” obligingly interposed Mr. Calder, by
way of a translation.
“Oh —what dey done lag me for, sah?
Rape, sail—dat’s all. I’se puffeckly honest,
sah. I ain’t no common t’ief, massa. I’se
a well-brought-up colored gemman. I’se”
Mr. Pilkington waved his hand for silence
and turned to the Frenchman.
“And you? What is your name, mv
man?”
The Frenchman —a spare and picturesque
person with black moustachios. and artisti-
cally curled and pomaded hair —placed his
right hand upon his diaphragm, and bowed
politely.
0 “Alphonse Denis-Marie Olivier, m’sieur,”
he replied impressively. . “I ’ave ’ad ze
honor to be chef to le Marquis de Saint-
Claire, it is d Londres pendant cinq annees
—how you say. five year? Le Marquis, il
est emigre, mrsieu' —apres la Revolution, s'il
vous plait. Je suis le plus grand”
“Oh —tut, tut —’tis a valet I wequire,
wather than a cook,” drawled Mr. Pilking-
ton.
“Un valet de chambre? Ah, oui, oui—
e'est moi aussi, m'sieu'. Je suis un valet
do” •
“Oh, taithez vous, mon garth on .” Mr. Pil-
kington interrupted him, as he turned to
the Englishman, a wiry and precise little
fellow, with the stamp of Cockaigne plain
in his every aspect.
“And you. my man?”
“Name o’ William Larkins, gov’nor.
Spitalfields.”
“Ah —and have you had any ecthpewienth
of attendanth upon a gentleman?”
“Th’ wefry best, y’r honor. I was with
Ike Simmons for three year.”
Mr. Pilkington leaped to his feet, all his
indolence vanished in an instant. He ran
forward, and seized the little man’s hand.
“The Tilburwy Twifle?” he exclaimed ex-
citedly.
“The same, gov’nor.”
“Why, my man—lthaac Thimmonth inth-
twucted me in the noble art!”
“Right ye are, gov’nor. I remembers yer
dial well, Mr. Pilkington, sir. O’ course

Zam-Buk Soothes the
Agonising Pain and Heals
with New Healthy Skin.
THE maddening smart of a burn or s:ald (and the fact that the action of the air
is injurious) calls for the immediate application of Zam-Buk.
Keep a pot of this soothing first-aid in the most “get-at-able” place. The kettle
may boil over or lurch from the hob any moment, and there is the daily risk of similar
mishaps to men, women and children alike.
Lighting one’s pipe isn’t always safe and painless; lifting dishes from the oven and
washing-up have their own warm surprises; and the youngsters learn many painful lessons
about playing with fire.
“A burnt child dreads the fire,” but if mother has applied Zam-Buk it loves THIS
PURE HEALING BALM ever afterwards. Zam-Buk is so soothing and cooling, and, besides
subduing pain and inflammation, it helps to grow new skin—a unique property which is
especially valuable in injuries of this kind. Much tissue is often destroyed, and those who
have watched a burn or scald heal up under Zam-Buk’s beneficent influence have often
marvelled at the wonderful work resulting from the application of a balm which works
hand in hand with Nature so harmoniously and effectively. New skin appears and spreads
over the destroyed surface like new rows of houses erected by an expert builder, and
soon the part is quite whole and sound again.

Mrs. Rose Robin-
son, of 52 Marshal]
Street, Moore Park,
Sydney, writes: —
“My daughter,
Nance, met with a
fearful accident
three years _ ago ;
she was sitting
before the fire,
when a kettle of
boiling water cap-
sized all over her
legs. inflicting
frightful injuries.
Huge blisters formed, and the skin came away
when the stocking was removed. Her legs were
in a red-raw state, and, through the dye of the
stockings getting in, blood-poisoning started. She
was in bed for three months, and although 1 tried
many different ointments to try and heal these
frightful injuries, none did her any good until I
used Zam-Buk.
“The first application of this balm gave her
wonderful ease, soothing the burning pains, and
drawing the heat and irritation out of the wounds.
Whereas unceasing treatment with other remedies
for three months did no good, Zam-Buk brought
about perfect healing in less than six weeks.”
Zam-Buk is unequalled for

ning sores, bad legs, ulcers, itch-

to his guests. “Oh rot me—the d —d fel-

One of the most inspiriting sights of Syd-
ney during that year was afforded by the
appearance in public, upon state occasions,
of Mr. Pilkington and his man Larkins.
Each Sunday morning—his church parades
were Mr. Pilkington’s greatest moments —a
dignified, solemn and eminently-splendid pro-
cession of two would set out from Moore-
field Villa (so named in honor of its tenant’s
mother) along the Rocks, in the direction
of St. Philip’s Church. The people stood
in their doorways to see it pass by, groups
loitered on the corners to enjoy the moving
spectacle, the congregation waited outside
the sacred edifice with the round tower for
its arrival.
Always immaculately dressed, Mr. Pil-
kington’s tout ensemble on Sunday mornings
would have done honor to St. James’s Park
in London, and entirely in keeping with it
was the less resplendent, but quite as taste-
ful, appearance of his valet. The master
was one of those fine figures whom con-
scientious tailors never dun for the price
of the raiment they become so faultlessly.
The man seemed to fit him and ornament
him, as did his boots or his gloves. It is
perfectly safe to hazard the statement that
never since the year T 6 has such an ele-
gant appearance been made in Sydney by
any man—beauty-actor or otherwise.
By trade William Larkins was a tailor;
by instinct, inclination and inspiration a
featherweight boxer; and, unfortunately, by
conviction (in its penal sense) a bigamist,
serving a sentence of five years’ transporta-
tion for his lamentable indiscretion. A
decent little man, but, like many other men
—big and little —a perennial victim to the
wiles of the wilier sex.
“Wimmen, gov’nor,” he once confided in
his master, “’ave bin me darnfall. Alius
was, an’ alius will be. An’, dammit, I don’
mind, so long’s tliey’s any ways reason’ble.”
“But why mawwy the cweatureth, Wil-
liam? At anywate, why mawwy them to
ectheth, ath you have done? Thutch indith-
cwethion! And what a loth you mutht
have been to the Twifle! You thould have
thought a little of Ithaac, you know, before
taking a Government ticket to thith plathe.
You thould have- — weally.”
“I s’pose a man can't ’elp sich things, y’r
honor.”
“Oh, well, you know, Bill —a man can
help bigamy, now can’t he? What on earth
made you go and do thuch a foolith thing
ath that? Damme, one wife’th too much
for motht fellowth! Why thaddle your-
thelf with two—thimultaneouthly?”
Mr. Larkins put down his clothes-brush
and thought for a moment.
“Well, look here, sir—axin’ your pai*don,
**ov’nor. Y t e’re a sportsman, y’r honor—so
T’l! tell you how ’twas. Me first wife, sir
—th’ first time—she presents me wi’ trip-
lets, y’r honor. S'elp me —three at a litter
“Well —that mutht thertainly have been
a little twying. Lafkintn. Tith, however,
uo valid gwound for committin’ bigamy, you
know! No juwy could be ecthpected to
take that into conthiderwation.”
“No, sir. An’ I put up with it. an’ stuck
to her. An’ what does y’r honor think?”
“Well?”
“I give ye me word, gov’nor—th' next time
she— she done it again!”
“Oh. gwathiouth, Larkinth —you don’t
thay tho! Oh —ho, ho, ho, ho ! Forgive my
laughing, my good man.” Mr. Pilkington
convulsed himself with mirth. “Oh, dear
me, Larkinth —all I can thay ith, you’re a
vewey hardly-used man. By heavens, you
are ! Oh —ho, ho, ho! Tho you thought it
time to theek a leth pwolifie conthort? Oh —
ho, ho, ho ! Oh, damme !”
On this particular Sunday morning it
almost seemed as though the exquisite pah-
must have had some premonition that the
stately institution of their weekly promenade
was about to come to its end. Never before
had Mr. Pilkington turned out in such elab-
orate splendor. Not hitherto had Bill Larkins
—even in the days when he served that dandy
of the prize ring, Isaac Simmons —so com-
pletely achieved the appearance in his person
of a perfect gentleman’s gentleman. The
master was an exclamation in the mode, and
the man his faithful echo.
You must not suppose from this that
there was anything in Mr. Pilkington’s attire
and equipment that could possibly savour of
the bad taste of exaggeration. It might have
been that so much gorgeousness was out of
keeping with his environment —which was
such, as regards clothing, that hardly half
the population of Sydney had any boots, and
quite a third wore pants with indifferent
seats. It is true that he did not altogether
harmonise with his surroundings. But had
he been in Brighton, or in Bond-street, or in
Bath, he would have passed for the very
acme of good taste and modest elegance. It
was only because he was in Sydney that he
was conspicuous. Sydney was unaccus-
tomed to fine tailoring and fashionable de-
portment.
As Mr. Pilkington and his retinue ap-
proached St. Philip’s from the north, the
Governor and his train drove up from the
eastward, and much bowing and hat-raising
took place, as the vice-regal party entered
the sacred and peculiar building.
“Oh, look at him, my dear Lachlan!”
whispered Mrs. Macquarie, as they entered
the church. “He is perfectly magnificent to-
day !”
Already the convict portion of the congre-
gation, with its guards, and the church-party
from the Barracks were in their places.
Two distinct crowds, as sharply divided as
though they had been drafted through a
gate, had been awaiting the arrival of his
Excellency before entering the church. They
were the sheen who had arrived free in the
colony, and the goats who had not done so.
however emancipated they nfight be now.
Macquarie made no distinction between
them, and neither d : d Mr. Pilkington—but
they were immensely careful of it them-
selves, or rather, the sheep were.
Mr. Pilkington occupied a pew immedi-
ately behind the Governor’s, and W illiam
Larkins had a seat, by special grace of his
clothing and Mrs. Macquarie’s favor,
amongst the servants from Government
House, where he was a resplendent and
notable figure.
The stately ritual of the Church of Eng-
land had proceeded without incident until
the Te Deum had been sung, and the congre-
gation seated itself again for the reading of
the second lesson.
Then a fearful thing happened.
The Rev. William Cowper had just com-
menced the recital of the portion of Holy
•Scripture appointed for the day, when down
in the body of the church a sudden yell
rang out, and a prayer-book came hurtling
over the people’s heads, and fell in the
chancel. Immediately there was a commo-
tion at the back, and, after a brief period
of struggle iu the pew occupied by the vice-
regal house-staff, the figure of William Lar-
kins emerged into the aisle, fled down it to
the open door, and disappeared outside.
“By heavens, sir,” whispered Macquarie
over the back of his pew to Mr. Pilkington,
“ ’Tis that servant of yours. He must have
gone mad !”
Mr. Pilkington hurried out.
Three hours later he interviewed his un-
happy valet in the gaol.
“But—gweat heaventh, William ! Why ?”
“Y’r honor, I axes y’r pardon for what I
done. But I had to do something. I had to.”
“But why, William —in the name of God,
why ?”
“Y’r honor —I’d but just sat down, when
I ’ears a voice be’ind me—a female voice.
A voice wot I knowed, y’r honor. It whis-
pered something to me.”
“Ah, was it your first wife, Bill,”
“No, y’r honor, ’twas me second; and
’twas wot she told me sent me barmy, y’r
honor. I knows well, an’ I’m glad of it,
that I’ll be sent to th’ roads for this. ’Twas
why I done it. Th’ chain gang’s th’ on’y
plice for a man like me —w’ere there ain’t
no wiminen. So ’elp me, it is!”
“But what did she tell you, William?”
“She tole me, y’r honor —she tole me she’d
bin brought to bed for th’ first time not
long after I’d bin sent way. But she’d got
together what money she could, an’ she’d
followed me to Sydney—a-bringin’ th’ chil-
dren.”
“ Children , Bill? How many, pway?”
“Three, y’r honor. It must be me.”
“My poor William!”
J. H. M. ABBOTT.
The Mother.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TEARS lay upon the edges of her eye-
lids and puckers of sadness gathered
around the corners of her rough
mouth.
“It’s yer fate. Yer were born” —she
stopped short.
The long, lean, fag-consuming male of
twenty-two seated on a tilted chair with his
head between his hands spat on to the stove
at intervals and offered no remarks.
“Gawd, when I think of ’ow I've slaved
for this!” There was a tone of reproach in
the mother's voice. She cut up meat into
large lumps and threw fistfuls into the
bottom of a saucepan. She scraped the table
with the butcher’s knife and as the fatty
ends of beef came into her palm she dropped
them on the floor to the dog.
The son drew from his pocket a crumpled
print that featured sport. There was silence
for a time. The woman with her hands on
her hips gazed into the fire.
“•Blime, I've won half a jim! Buster
Brown knocked Hollo Barker in a round an'
a ’arf Saturdee night.”
The woman sighed and stirred the meat
and potatoes and remained silent for a time.
Presently she said :
“If yer father had been alive I’d ha’ gone
to him.”
She spoke like a woman who would have
been doing something desperate.
“What are yer going to do?” she con-
tinued ; “yer can’t afford it.
“What can a man do?” he snarled.
“Yer not goin’ to marry her?” She looked
over her shoulder hurriedly.
“She’s cornin’ round ter-mght and I pro-
mised to let her know, he replied evasively.
“Yer father might er knocked a John or
two and got into trouble, but he was always
good to me. He never married, because he
didn’t believe in it, and he never seemed to
have the time, somehow.” She spoke as if
she were vindicating the reputation of a
good man who had departed and was being
maligned. She was sobbing now. The son
shuffled his feet and said, "Cut it out,” from
behind a smoke screen.
There was the click-clack of heels and the
noise of someone feeling the way up the
rieketty steps that led to the kitchen.
The mother eyed the hard-faced young
female that stood in the doorway.
“Good-night, Bill,” the girl said, peering
from under a strand of hair plastered over
her left eye.
“Come in and sit down, Em.”
Em steered across the dirty floor. The two
women glared at each other with hatred and
distrust.
“Well,” said the elder, “yer’ve come for
him, have yer?” She spoke as if the girl
were an executioner come to prepare her
sou for death.
“What’s the matter with you?” Em queried
with slow nasal drawl.
“What’s the matter with me? Now yer
arskin!” There was a ring of triumph in
her voice when she spoke again. “Thanlc
Gawd, he’ll never be able to keep yer.”
The breath hissed through her teeth as a
pugilist’s when he lands the knock-out.

Engine is just such a job. The moment you see the famous Lister Engine alongside any other you* will admit Giat
it’s a beautiful piece of machinery, embodying every feature that the most exacting engine buyer could ask tor. Ihe
mere fact that the War Office absorbed practically the entire output of Lister Engines during the war speaks volumes
for their reputation as reliable engines.
WHY THE LISTER EXCELS ALL OTHERS —It is heavily built, of British materials. Has Magneto Ignition,
Throttling Governor, Dust-proof Bearings, Carburetter will not flood, Automatic Fuel Feed, Automatic Lubrication—
