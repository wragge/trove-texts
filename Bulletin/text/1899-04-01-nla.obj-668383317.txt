THE BED PAGE .
The seventh volume of the transactions of the
Australasian Association for the Advancement of
Science is sent for review. .It covers 1200 pages,
and is printed and cloth-bound by N.S.W. Govt.
Printer, who supplies numerous maps and illustra-
tions. The book is a taxpayers’ gift to the
A.A.A.S., which sells it for 10s. 6d. to the indivi-
dual taxpayer. The number of copies printed,
and the cost, do not appear: one surmises 1000,
and £750. The book consists chiefly of papers
read at the Association’s seventh meeting, held at
Sydney last year; and these papers are printed
separately and a number of copies presented by
the taxpayers to each paper-contributor, who
usually re-presents them to individual taxpayers,
his friends. The process of printing and presen-
tation is part of N.S.W. contribution to “ Science ”
—which is a vague entity, with occasionally some
astonishing attributes.
• * * *
The Association meets biennially in different
provinces ; and it appears that all the provinces
excepting Westralia have in turn given liberal
assistance in money and printing. Meetings were
for several years held annually; but latterly the
zeal at the Association’s disposal has only sufficed
for a meeting every two years. The A.A.A.S.
was founded in 1888. Its first meeting was
attended by 850 members; then the numbers run
1162, 550, 600, 488, 524, to 685 at last meeting.
Public interest in the Association’s operations is
not increasing, it seems. The last balance-sheet
shows three years’ receipts as £886; made up of
subscriptions £679, a profit from previous meeting
of <£7o, interest on mortgage £123, and sales of
vols. of proceedings £l2 odd—from which it ap-
pears that the individual taxpayer con tents him-
self with purchasing less than a dozen volumes a
year. With the exception of £43 carried to
investment account, the income went in office
expenses, printing, advertising, expenses of meet-
ings, and so on. A L-Wlertafel concert cost the
Association £35.
• * * *
The Association's total inoome during its ten
years’ existence was some £6750. It has £l4OO
invested on mortgage; £lBO loose cash; and it
has devoted £9O to “assisting science.” The rest
has gone to grease the wheels. But there is no
bread-and-sack implication ; for pan-Australasian
machinery needs a lot of grease, and much labour
is given gratis. Professor Liversidge, for example,
who lives at Sydney University and edits the 1200-
page volume, gets nothing for the work. He is
permanent secretary, and occasionally president as
well—and both are honorary positions. Beside
the traditional reward of virtue, the only remune-
ration attached to his office by the 1200-page
volume is the pleasure of forwarding an address to
Queen Victoria, expressing the A.A.A.S.’s “deep
affection and loyalty,” and congratulating
the _ lady on her goodness in permitting
“Science” to advance during a 60-years’
For this address the President received
Queen Victoria’s deputy’s “warm thanks,” and
there is apparently some obscure attribute of
“ Science ” which feels better for the “thanks.”
• • * •
A considerable portion of the Association’s re-
port is taken up in printing the names and ad-
dresses of cometary gentlemen who fly through
‘Science” with long tails of letters attached to
their names. This letter-phenomenon is scientifi-
cally interesting, for it represents the survival in
“civilised ” times of the savage’s habit of adorning
himself with shells and gaudy stones. Brown-
ascends from South-Sea Chief
vv obblegobble with three feathers in his wool.
Smith - Robinson, M.A., L.L.D., F.R.A.S.,
stalks as proudly through the 1200-page volume
as the distinguished Papuan who walks in
ceremonial procession with nine streaks of paint
and an elegant nose-ring. Labels, as labor-saving
devices, have their uses. When you are intro-
duced to “ Tomkins, geologist, ” you are given a
clue by which to unravel Tomkins, and are saved
from wasting upon him your pet ideas regarding
the functions of the thyroid gland. But letters
are such inefficient labels,, and are really not deco-
rative. A reversion to the paint-and-feathers
method of adornment need make the meetings of
the A.A.A.S. no less scientific, and would cer-
tainly make them more aesthetically attractive.
* * * *
Passing through the cometary belt, one comes
upon the large space occupied by scientific stars of
various magnitudes. Not all the papers read to
the Association are printed ; but the selection
ranges over many fields of valuable research, and
testifies that the objects of the A.A.A.S. are being
assiduously chased over Australasia. These objects
are—
To give a stronger impulse and a more systematic direc-
tion to scientific enquiry; to promote the intercourse of
those who cultivate science in different parts of the Aus-
tralasian colonies and in other countries ; to obtain more
general attention to the objeots of science, and a removal
Of any disadvantages of a public kind which may impede
its progress.
And it is fair to say that the Association seems to
be catching its objects as well as chasing them.
* * * •
The seventh volume of transactions suggests
more comments than can be here set down. One
obvious reflection after survey of the papers is
that the faculty of generalisation tne most
valuable faculty of the scientific mind—seems to be
rara avis in terris. Nearly all the authors are
occupied with detail-observations of phenomena ;
and in many branches of science detail-observa-
tions have _ accumulated past reckoning. As
Literature is being buried beneath books, so
Science is entombed under “ records ” —often made
with the greatest care, and involving lifetimes of
scientific labour, yet useless for want of collation,
classification and reduction to principles. The
earthquake-observations of the A.A.A.S. are in
point. There is a special seismological committee,
and much labour is being expended in observing
and recording; but it is doubtful whether the
observations so far have a corresponding scientific
value. All over the world observers are reporting,
but it is not clear that the British or other central
authority is profiting by the enormous mass of
records.’ While the little minds are counting
shocks, we want in Australia a few big minds to
deduce the lesson of the shocks, and add to our
knowledge why, when, and how seismic dis-
turbances are caused, and how they are likely
to proceed in the future. The A.A.A.S. should
set some of its members to consolidating and codi-
fying and deducing unity from variety and con-
trariety—-just as S. W. Griffith has tried to do
with the Queensland laws.
* * * *
Apart from its knavish tricks in the political
field, S. W. Griffith’s is a mind that does one good
m contact: it is so subtle, so clear, and moves
with such a power and sweep. Yet even S. W.
Griffith seems often at fault when there is question
of educing a principle from a mass of details. He
gathers data splendidly, but does not always
appear to appreciate relative values : apparently
his mind cannot rise far enough from the facts to
gain the broadest vision. Griffith’s contribution
to the volume under notice is a discussion of
criminal responsibility, with special reference to
his own view as incorporated in the draft Q
criminal code (has it not been shelved by Q.
Parliament ?) The section dealing with the vexed
question of insanity may be quoted—
-29. A person is not criminally responsible for an act
or omission if at the time of doing or making the
omission he is in such a state of mental disease or natural
mental infirmity as to deprive him of capacity to under-
stand what he is doing, or of capacity to control his
actions, or of capacity to know that he ought not to do
the act or make the omission.
A person whose mind, at the time of his doing or omit-
ting to do an act, is affected by delusions on some specific
matter or matters, but who is not otherwise entitled to
the benefit, of the foregoing provisions of this section, is
criminally responsible for the act or omission to the same
extent as if the real state of things had been such as he
was induced by the delusions to believe to exist.
This may be fairly held an improvement on exist-
ing law as laid down in the MaoNaghten case;
but it is still very far from the root of the matter.
For example, it may be held that a criminal act is
any act which is at variance with the rules made by
the community for the conduct of the individual,
and called laws.
The measure of the criminality of such an act
is determined solely by the magnitude of the
offence against the community, as shown by the
extent of the breach of law.
The object of the community is to prevent
crime: so-called “punishment ”is mere vengeance
—which breeds more crime. The commission of
any criminal act makes it necessary for the com-
munity to devise the best means of preventing its
repetition by the agent or by others.
The sanity or insanity of the agent makes no
difference in the criminality of the act, so far as it
concerns the community. If either a sane or an
insane man is a danger to the oommunity, the
community has just as much right to destroy one
as the other.
From the community’s point of view, therefore,
insanity excuses no one ; and the question whether,
for example, a homicidal maniac shall be hanged
or asylumed is a matter (1) of the community’s
convenience, and (2) of the satisfaction of the com-
munity’s desire to prevent further homicides.
In other words, so far as the community is con-
cerned, the guilt is in the criminal aot, not in the
agent. The community should entirely dissociate
criminal acts from the personality of the agent,
and should view such acts wholly in relation to
the future, and not at all in relation to the past:
This is as good a theory of jurisprudence as has
yet been formulated, and it easily ends the
otherwise unsolvable problem of criminal respon-
sibility. Since we are all more or less insane, the
measure of a sane responsibility under existing
law can only refer to an approximate standard,
and any individual’s measure of another indi-
vidual’s insanity will always be more or less un-
satisfactory guesswork.
And, though the theory is dogmatio, Law is
dogmatic. It can never be logically proved that the
community has any more ethical right to impose its
standards of conduct upon the individual than the
individual has to impose his standards upon the
community ; and all attempts at proof are either
“ sacred ” myth or argumentative moonshine.
And the rest of the 1200-page volume is
waiting. A 1200-page volume !
MY PROPERTIES.
I own no park, I keep no horse,
I can’t afford a stable,
I have no cellar stored with wine,
I set a frugal table ;
But still some property is mine,
Enough to suit my notion :
I own a mountain toward the west,
And toward the east an ocean.
Just this one mountain and one sea
Are property enough for me.
A man of moderate circumstance,
A frugal man, like me,
With one good mountain has enough,
Enough with one good sea.
My mountain stretches high enough,
Up where the clouds are curled;
My ocean puts its arms around
The bottom of the world.
I do not fear my sea will dry;
My hill will last as long as I. . . .
And so I’m glad the mountain’s mine,
I’m glad I own the sea,
That they have special privacies
Which they impart to me.
It took eternity to learn
The tales they know so well,
And I am glad these tales will take
Eternity to tell.
I do not fear my sea will dry;
My hill will last as long as I.
S. W. Foss.
A New American Humourist.
In Peter Dunne, one of the editors of Chicago
Journal , America has found a new and veritable
humourist in the class of Artemus Ward and
Mark Twain. “Mr. Dooley,” a mythical Irish -
American, is the protagonist of Dunne’s-dramatic
commentaries on men and things, and he makes
the happiest hits! The Dooley book, just pub-
lished over the water, has not yet reached Aus-
tralia,, and this account of Rostand’s famous play,
“Cyrano de Bergerac,” is transferred from S.F.
Argonaut :—
“ Iv’ry winter Hogan’s la-ad gives a show with
what he calls th’ Sixth Wa-rd Shakespeare an’
Willum J. Bryan club, an’ I was. sayjooced into
goin’to wan las’ night at Finucane’s Hall,” said
Mr. Dooley.
“ Th’ girls was goin’,’ said Mr. Hennessy, “ but
the shtovepipe come down on th’ pianny an’ we
had a minsthrel show iv our own. What was it
about, I dinnaw.”
“ Well, sir,” said Mr. Dooley, “I ain’t much on
th’ theayter. I niver went to wan that I didn’t
have to stand where I cud see a man in blue over-
alls scratchin’ his leg just beyant where th’
heeroyne was prayin’ on th’ palace stairs, an’ I
don’t know much about it; but it seemed to me,
an’ it seemed to Hartigan, th’ plumber, that was
with me, that ’twas a good play if they’d been a
fire in th’ first act. They was a lot iv people there,
an’ if it cud’ve been arranged f’r to have injine
company fifteen, with Cap’n Duffy at th’ head iv
thim, come in through a window an’ carry off th*
cr-owd, ’twud’ve med a hit with me.
_ “ ’Tis not like anny play I iver seen befure or
since. In ‘ Tur-r’ble Tom ; or, Th’ Boys iv
Ninety-Eight,’ that I see wanst, th’ man that’s
the main guy iv th’ thing he waits till ivry wan
has said what he wants to say an’ he has a clean
field, an’ thin he jumps in as th’ man that plays
th’ big dhrum gives it an uppercut. But with this
here play iv ‘ Cyrus O’Bergerac ’ ’tis far diff’rent.
Tli’ curtain goes up an’ shows Bill Delaney an’
little Tim Scanlan an’ Mark Toolan an’ Paeky
Dugan, that wurruks in th’ shoe store, an’ Molly
Donohue an’ th’ Casey sisters, thim that scandal-
ised th’ parish be doin’ a skirt-dance at th’ fair, all
walkin’ up an’ down talkin’. ‘Tin to wan on
Sharkey,’ says Toolan. ‘I go ye an’ make it a
hunderd,’ says Tim Scanlan. ‘Was ye at th’
cake-walk?’ ‘Who stole me hat?’ “Cudden’t
ye die waltzin’? ’ ‘ They say Murphy has gone on
th’ force.’ ‘Hivins, there goes th’ las’ carl’
‘ Pass th’ butther, please, I’m far fr’m hom. ’ All
iv them talkin’ away at wanst, niver carin’ f’r no
wan, whin all at wanst up shteps me bold Hogan
with a nose on him—glory be, such a nose ! I
niver see th’ like on a man or an illyphant!
“Well, sir, Hogan is Cy in th’ play, an’ th’
beak is par-rt iv him. What does he do ?
He goes up to Toolan, an’ says he: ‘Ye
don’t like me nose. It’s a ilicthric-light globe.
Blow it out. It’s a Swiss cheese. Cut it
off if ye want to. It’s a brick in a hat.
Kick it. Tt’s a balloon. Hang a basket on
it, an’ we’ll have an asoinsion. It’s a dure-bell
knob. Ring it. It’s a punchin’-bag. Hit it if ye
dare. F’r two pins I’d push in th’ face iv ye.’
An’ mind ye, Hinnissy, Toolan had said not wan
wurrud about th’ beak—not wan wurrud. An’
ivery wan in th’ house was talkin’ about it and
wondhrin’ whin it’d come off an’ smash someone’s
fut. I looked f’r a fight there an’ thin. But
Tool an’s a poor-spirited thing, an’ he wint away.
At that up comes Scanlan, an’ says he: ‘Look
here, young fellow,’ he says, ‘don’t get gay,’he
says. ‘Don’t get gay,’he says. ‘ What’s that?’
says Hogan. Whin a man says ‘What’s that?’
in a bar-room, it manes a fight. If he says it
wanst. If he says it twict, it manes a fut-race.
‘I say,’ says Scanlan, ‘ that if ye make anny more
funny cracks, I’ll hitch a horse to that basket-
fender, ’he says, 1 an’ drag it fr’m ye, ’he says. At
that Hogan drew his soord, an’ says he: ‘ Come
on, ’ he says, ‘ come on an’ take a lickin’, ’ he says.
An’ Scanlan drew his soord, too. ‘Wait,’ says
Hogan. ‘Wait a minyit,’ he says. ‘I must
think,’ he says. ‘I must think a pome,’ he
says. ‘Whiniver I fight,’ he says, ‘I always
have a pome, ’he says. ‘ G-lory be, ’ says I, ‘ there’s
Scanlan’s chanst to give it to him,’ I says. But
Scanlan was as slow as a dhray, an’ befure he
oud get action Hogan was at him, l’adin’ with th’
pome an’ counthrin’ with th’ soord. ‘ I’ll call this
pome, ’ he says, ‘ a pome about a gazabo I wanst had
a dool with in Finucane’s Hall, ’ he says. ‘ I’ll
threat ye r-right, ’ he says, ‘ an’ at th’ last line I’ll
hand ye. wan, ’he says. An’ he done it. ‘Go in, ’
he says in th’ pome, ‘go in an’ do ye’er worst, ’ he
says. ‘ I make a pass at ye’er stomak,’ he says ;
‘ I cross ye with me r-right,’ he says, ‘ an’, he says,
‘at the last line,’ he says, ‘I soak ye,’he says.
An’ he done it. _ Th’ minyit ’twas over with th’
Eome ’twas off with Scanlan. Th’ soord wint into
im an’ he sunk down to th’ flure an’ they had to
carry him off. Well, sir, Hogan was that
proud ye cudden’t hold him f’r th’ r-rest
iv th’ night. He wint ar-round ivr.ywhcre
stickin’ people an’ soakin’ thim with pothry.
He’s a gr-reat pote is this here Hogan, an’ a
gr-reat fighter. He done thim all at both, but like
me ol’ frind Jawn L., he come to th’ end. A man
dhropped a two-be-four on his head wan day an’
he died. Honoria Casey was with him as he
passed away, an’ she says: ‘ How d’ye feel ?
‘ All r-right, ’ says Hogan ; ‘ but wan thing I’ll tel
ye has made life worth livin’, ’he says. ‘ What's
that ? ’ says Miss Casey. ‘ I know, ’ says I: * anny-
wan cud guess it. He manes his nose,’ I says.
But ivrywan on th’ stage give it up. ‘Ye don’t
know,’ says Hogan,; ‘’tis me hat,’ he says, an
maltin’ a low bow to th’ audjence he fell to th’ flure
so hard that his nose fell off an’ rowled down on
Mike Finnegan. ‘ I don’t like th’ play, ’ says Fin-
negan, ‘an’l’ll break ye’er nose,’he says, an’he
done it. He’s a wild divvle. Hogan thried to
rayturn th’ compliment on th’ sidewalk afther-
ward, but he cudden’t think iv a pome, an’ Finne-
gan done him. ”
“Well,” said Mr. Hennessy, “I’d like to’ve
been there to see th’ fightin’.”
“ In th’ play ? ” asked Mr. Dooley.
“ No,” said Mr. Hennessy; “on the sidewalk.”
—— '
Frank Harris’s Saturday Review papers on
Shakespeare are to be republished. He concludes
that Shakespeare has painted himself as the pro-
tagonist in thirteen of his chief plays :
In Love’s Labour’s Lost he is Biron.
„ Two Gentlemen of Verona „ Valentine.
~ Romeo and Juliet ~ Borneo.
~ As You Like It „ Jaques.
„ Twelfth Night „ The Duke.
„ Hamlet „ Hamlet.
„ Measure for Measure „ The Duke.
„ Julius Ccesar „ Brutus.
~ Macbeth „ Macbeth.
„ Troilus and Cressida „ Troilus.
„ Timon „ Timon.
~ Gymbeline „ Posthumus.
~ The Tempest „ Prospero.
These characters can easily be separated into two
types. The heart of the man and his poet’s tem-
perament are embodied in Biron, Romeo, Troilus,
and the Duke of “Twelfth Night ”; the intellect
and character of the man are incorporated in
Valentine, Jaques, Brutus, Hamlet, Macbeth,
Posthumus, and Prospero.
Some of these identifications seem debatable. But
Harris’s main idea undoubtedly deserves more
stress than it has hitherto received. Shakespeare’s
plays should be considered and criticised not as
detached achievements, but as related products of
Shakespeare the man.
PETER, THE ORTHODOX.
“Pete, you’re a common laughing-stock,
You are the village butt,
Your hair is so outrageous long—
Why don’t you have it cut? ”
“ Bekase dere ain’t no barber, sah,
Dat’s goot ernuff foh me;
Dere ain’t no barber in dis town
Dat’s up to my idee.”
“Why, there is ’Rastus Graham, Pete,
A barber up to par.”
“La ! yes ; but then I kain’t hev him,
Foh he’s a Baptis’, sah.
No low-down Baptis’ heretic
So bigotty ez he
Shall never cut de ha’r upon
A Meferdis like me.”
“But Pratt’s a barber just as good
As any on the list;
A splendid barber, and besides
An earnest Methodist.”
“He am a Meferdis, I know,
But I kain’t train wiv Pratt
Bekase I am a ’Publican
An’ he’s a Dimmerkrat.”
“Butthere is Bangs, a Methodist,
A very righteous man,
A Methodist in high repute,
A good Republican.”
“But he’s a homerpaff, the wretch,
Ez bad ez he can be,
An’ he kain’t cut de wool on sich
An aliopaff ez me.
“ I stall’s foh righteousness, I does,
Foh troof an’ nuffin less;
No Baptis’ trash an’ homerpaffs
Can suit iny piousness.
W’en some good barber comes to town,
A Meferdis fair an’ squar’,
An aliopaff an’ ’Publican,
W’y, he can cut my ha’r.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Australia is the one place in the world
where the towns are more beautiful than the
country,” said Sidney Webb in a recent London
address. Webb found the Botanical Gardens in
the Australian capitals “dreams of loveliness,”
but got tired of gum-trees. In the same address
he advises skilled artisans to “transfer themselves
to Australia,” but declares that there is no room
here for the unskilled laborer. But it is the un-
skilled laborer that Dreary Dickson is going to
shovel into Leperland—to compete with Kanakas.
The Man from Cog-hill’s Creek.
He ordered first a whisky, then he drank a pint of
beer.
And gazed on those around him with a happy sort
of leer;
He said: “You coves wot’s willin’ give the
blanky thing a name ”
Like soldiers at the bugle-call before the bar they
came.
“You’ll stop to-night, old party, eh ! ” said the
barman, “ Bill the Sneak.”
“ Yes, rather tired of padding, see, I came from
Coghill’s Creek. ”
TI ie pints were ranged in order fair along the
grimy bar,
“Whose beer is that ?” enquired the man who’d
trodden tracks afar.
“M'Cracken’s,” said the publican, “and good it
is at that;
It has a head that can’t be beat, you bet your
bloomin’ hat.”
“ Two rounds of drinks for all the crowd—l know
things when I speak—
I’ll bet it ain’t M'Cracken’s,” said the man from
Coghill’s Creek.
The publican in pity looked upon the “bloomin’
mug ”;
And “spot the cash” demanded, as he wiped a
mouldy jug.
Then called him in behind the bar ; “ you see the
barrels there,
M'Cracken’s name is on thim, and ye’ve lost the
wager fair.”
“ Not I. You’ve bought and paid for them. Now
chew' the bloomin’ leek,
And pay the blessed wager,” said the man from
Coghill’s Creek.
“Not quite so fast, me hearty,” said the publican ;
“y’ know
M’Cracken’s agent kem last week and bought this
blessed show.
There’s the dupe-lee-kate agreemint, and, me
friend, y’re nicely jammed ”
The betting-man he whistled, then he muttered,
“Well, I’m damned ”
“ They keep me here to sell the beer at thirty bob
a week ”
He hastened for the setting sun, the man from
Coghill’s Creek.
BEN SUN.
The last Shift.
Our last romance is ended,
That had red gold for theme ;
The glamour of the sinking
Is but a dim, red dream,
Stored with a vague remembrance
Of creek and camp and claim,
And mates who worked beside us
Before the parting came.
Our hut alone left standing,
Its rotten bark awry ;
Our smoke the last wreaths curling
Up to the aching sky,
Staring at desolation
Where once worked toiling hordes,
And laughter rose at sunset,
And drifted western-wards.
But shift and shift have vanished,
Fresh fields to seek afar ;
We’ve fossicked out their leavings
From mullock-bar to bar ;
We two left lone together—
Grey mates grown old in toil;
We work the last shift, weary
With years of dreary moil.
Grey mates grown old together—
What fields our young days knew !
We followed fortune’s footprints
With “colors ” for a clue,
Spell out our tale of roving
By camp and tented town ;
And, hark !—the rising water
That frets the loose drift down.
For water finds its level
As we have found our fate,
After a life of roving
To duffer out, old mate;
To end our days in dreaming,
In musing and regrets—
And drive and shaft are crushing
The rotten timber-sets.
Oh, once we followed fortune,
But we have lost the trail;
Old eyes grow weak with watching,
And fate was, we should fail.
We’ll work our shift together,
The last the field will know;
Last shift —grey Death to follow—
’Tis luck we end it so.
W.A.

The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Payette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
J were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
i them. Marching with drum and fife
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light, of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Hoodie was heard as never
was heard before or since.

SATURDAY, APRIL 1, 1899.
The Unpublished Manifesto of Anti-Bill.
The Bulletin had a most remarkable dream
last night. It dreamt that the provincialist
party in New South Wales had published a
perfectly frank and honest manifesto con-
taining a full statement of its position. The
document read as follows :
We, the old Cabbage-Tree Mob of New South Wales,
led by George Dibbs, George Dibbs’s brother, the two
Heydons, and 18 other assorted fossils from the unre-
formed Leg. Council, also Sydney Daily Telegraph,
George Pile’s dog, S. A. Rosa and Kohen with a K, do
fake our solemn oath as follows :
(1) In the days that were before Genesis the first Tory
rushed to and fro with nothing on, calling out, “ Oh,
Lord, preserve Chaos.” He had no money invested in
chaos, but he rushed to and fro merely out of his innate
objection to all kinds of progress. ' We mention this
chestnut to show that we are acting on old-established
precedent. We want to preserve chaos.
(2) Some of us want the capital located in Sydney
because we have property there, or trade there. Some of
us want to be sure that our free newspaper postage won’t
be interfered with. Some of us are against Federation be-
cause it means an inevitable reduction in the size, and pro-
bably also in the salary of thelocal Parliament, and we may
lose our billets. Some of us hate the proposed Federal
Constitution because it proposes to build both Houses of
Parliament on that highly objectionable thimr—manhood
suffrage. Some of us object to the referendum. Some
of us feel that we are too small potatoes to have any
chance of distinction in the Parliament of all Australia,
yet don’t want the ignominy of being left behind in a
mere local Legislature. And most of us are old men who
have spent all our lives in the little narrow rut of our
own province, till we have come to believe that this
great busy world all revolves round New South Wales,
and that it is the only place worth mentioning on earth,
and that all the virtues are inside it, and everybody out-
side it is a thief at heart, and that no other province
should have a voice in anything or an opinion about any-
thing.
(3) We have talked froth and bunkum about the un-
paralleled greatness of ourselves and our little place until
we are capable of going quite mad whenever it is
suggested that any other province should have any voice
in the making of the Federal compact.
(4) And some of us, like our naked ancestor in Genesis,
merely want to preserve chaos on general principles.
* » * *
(5) We are aware that all the invitations to federate of
late years have been issued by New South Wales to the
other provinces. Parkes issued one nine years ago, and
a Federal scheme was drawn up. It came to nothing,
because Neiv South Wales dropped it. Dibbs issued an-
other and dropped it. Reid issued another, and wrecked
it by his 80,000 minimum ; and then he issued a second
one. It is because it has always been a case of New South
Wales asking the other provinces to come in and federate
w, W> h er tha,t we represent them as a crowd Of grasping'
and dishonest harpies, who are always stri vine- to federate
with New South YVales for their OWn profit.
(6) When New South Wales Parliament rejected the
Bill last year by the simple process of disqualifying the
pro-Bill majority, none of the other provinces asked us to
move any further in the matter. If New- South Wales
hadn’t insisted on going on with it, and asked its neigh-
bors to make a new start, the matter would apparently
have been dropped. This proves that the other provinces
are all craving to federate with us from the basest motives
of plunder.
(7) The fact that New South Wales hks so constantly
asked the other provinces to conie in and federate with it
shows that New South Wales’s own 'motives are as pure
as the sriowball.on the top of Kosciusko.
(8) In this and Other matters we speak confidently as
representing the people of New South Wales. We were
horribly licked and left at the bottom of the poll in the
election of Federal delegates, which shows that the
people are with us. We were licked by 5367 votes at the
referendum, which further proves that the people are
with us.
(9) The old Bill was “ contemptuously rejected ’’ On Srd
June, 1898. There were 71,595 votes for it, and <36,228
against it, and 170,000 people thought provincialism so
little worth preserving that the-V didn’t vote at all. We
show that we won bv assuming that 'these 170,000 who
didn t vote for provincialism were all provincialists. We
don t bring- forward .any evidence in support of this state-
ment, but just say It. Our capacity for saying things is
something- enormous.
(1°) We say that we have a majority against the new
Bill, and we ha,ve got up all the petitions we could im-
.plonng' the Legislature not to give us a chance of proving
it by letting the people have a straight-out vote on the
new- Bill. We are a fighting crowd, hut w-e prefer to
conduct the scrimmage through the telephone.
• • * *
(11) Our strong point is that New South Wales is the
only province that can be trusted. The first Federal
Conference started w'ith an agreement that the minimum
vote should be 50,000 each for New South Wales and Vic-
toria and 6000 each for Tasmania and West Australia.
We were the only crowd that broke the agreement, which
shows clearly that all the others are liars and can’t be
depended upon for an instant.
(12) A year ago we were strongly demanding that the
capital should be in New South Wales. We have grot it,
but we fro on cursing just the same.
(13) Under the present agreement the capital must be
at least 100 miles from Sydney, 160 miles from Melbourne,
160 miles from Adelaide, 75 miles from Brisbane, 400 miles
from Hobart or 1500 miles from Perth. The language
we use against the Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and
Hobart people about the insult put upon Sydney in this
matter is something awful. As for the insult which we
put upon all the other cities when w'e demanded that the
capital should be in New- South Wales, and thereby
imposed the above distance limit on them, it doesn't
matter. We have a right to insult anybody as much as
w'e like on account of our superior wisdom and extra
gentlemaniiness of demeanor.
(14) We started the Federal campaign over a year ago
by publicly denouncing the Other provinces (Victoria
especially) as “thieves," “wolves,” “robbers," “five
drunkards,” &c. This shows distinctly the undvin»-
hatred which these other provinces have towards us. *
(l'<) Ayearago we were busy pointing out that Victoria
"'“<* going to enact a whole lot of new bounties (under the
Bill new bounties had to be legalised before 30th June,
1898, else the Commonwealth wouldn’t permit them) in
order to gain for its industries a mean advantage over
those of New South Wales. In reply Victoria prorogued
its Parliament to such a late date that it couldn’t effect
its alleged base purpose within the time limit We
didn’t apologise for the lie and slander. Our finer in-
stincts aren’t built that way.
(16) Also we invented a beautiful fiction to the effect
that the Commonwealth would have to pay Victoria’s
bounties. We didn’t ask that this dreadful thing should
be taken out of the Bill at the Premiers’ Conference in
fact, we couldn’t, for we knew it wasn't In the Bill any-
where. The lie got worn to rags at last, and then dropped
by the wayside somewhere. Anybody finding it will
please return it at once.
* • * .
(17) The other provinces agreed that we should have
certain concessions over and above the original bargain
the bargain which the people of New South Wales
endorsed by a majority of 5367 votes. Their willingness
to give us these concessions shows that they are thieves
and ruffians of the very worst type. Some people say
“ Thank you ’’ when they get a concession like that. We
said “ Blast! ” and “ Damn !’’ and “ You’re a liar ! ”
(15) The fact that the other provinces agreed that the
capital should be in New South Wales proves that they
are going to have it iri Victoria.
(19) If the other provinces hadn’t agreed to have the
capital in New South Wales that would also have proved
that it was going to be in Victoria.
(20) In fact, anything they could have done or left un-
done would have proved that they were going to have the
capital in Victoria.
(21) As matters stand the agreement is that each pro-
vince is to keep its own lands, its railways (unless it
chooses to hand them over), to pay the same taxation,
and to get back its share of the surplus on the same prin-
ciples. We don’t agree to pay a single copper for any of
the other provinces, and we are to have the capital.
Consequently we all yell at the top of our voices about
the great special “sacrifices” which New South Wales is
making for the other provinces. Full details of these
sacrifices couldn’t be got out of us with a steam-crane, for
we haven’t the faintest idea what they are, but we yell
just the same.
(22) We particularly want sole control of the Darling
and Murray. A great deal of the Darling water conies
down from Queensland, and much of the Murray water
from the Victorian Alps, but they are “ our rivers ’’ just
the same. Our terms are that we should have absolute
power to cut off South Australia’s water-supply in dry
seasons, and South Australia should have no claim for
compensation against us if we choose to let our exclusive
rivers do damage in her territory in flood times.
(23) Anybody who objects to any of the above proposi-
tions is a traitor, and is evidently in the pay of Victoria.
(24) Our general attitude is that Victo'ria is a poor-
miserable place without a cent, and that the amount of
money it spends in trying to buy votes on behalf of the
Federal Bill in New South Wales is something incredible
(25) Also, that New South Wales is the greatest and
richest and most progressive and intelligent province in
Australasia, and that its people, if they federate, will be
robbed and kicked with impunity by everybody, being
too imbecile to do anything in their own defence.' ’
(26) The fact that Victoria was quite willing that New
South Wales should have certain concessions over and
above the terms of the bargain, and didn’t ask for any
new concessions herself, shows that she is arrogantly at-
tempting to dictate the terms of the partnership. This
is further evidenced by the fact that Victoria never asked
for any partnership, but simply agreed to come in at the
request of New South Wales. As our splashy and valued
ally, G. Dibbs,. puts it, we are expected “to bow down
at the feet of our youngest child ” and accept any condi-
tions she likes to dictate.

(27) Not one among us has the political honesty to say,
straight out, that he is absolutely against Federation.
(A doubtful exception is here made in favor of George
Pile’s dog.) We hope to get more votes by declaring
that we are ardent Federationists, and only object on the
most strongly Federal grounds, to the details of every
scheme which comes along.
(28) Particularly we are against the financial scheme
embodied in the Bill. We say it is utterly bad, and that
we want a better one. When the proposed amendments
were before the Assembly, and afterwards the Council, we
carefully avoided stating what was the better scheme we
wanted, and we have also avoided it in all our speeches •
(1) because we don’t really know what this scheme is—no
two of us say the same thing about it; (2) because we
don t know how to draw up a scheme ; (3) because we
don’t know what we want; (4) because we don’t want any
scheme at ail—all we want is to preserve chaos. And it
would have been beastly awkward if we had proposed a
scheme, and it was accepted, and then we were compelled
either to support the Bill or say that our financial plan
was the work of a disastrous idiot.
(29) So we confine ourselves to saying that all we want
is a financial arrangement that will he fair to New South
Wales; and we never explain what kind of financial
arrangement will be fair to New South Wales. But when-
ever any arrangement is suggested we say that it isn’t
fair to New South Wales. Sometimes we ‘state that we
could draw up a fair and equitable scheme in half-an-
hour, but we never do it.
(30) If any arrangement could be made whereby the
majority would always rule; and Sydney would have
more votes than all the rest of Australia put together •
and the Federal Constitution could be altered "by the’
majority at any time, unless the alteration was one which
the Sydney traders and property-owners didn’t approve
of, in which case the majority wouldn’t count; and the
capital would always be at Sydney, whether the majority
wanted it or not, then we would be prepared to think
over the matter and see what we could object to next.
(31) Therefore We, the badly-licked majority that was
at the bottom of the bolt valiant!}’ in the presence
of the of New South Wales, and hope for the
WOrst. In evidence whereof we subscribe ourselves in
the presence of the two Dibbsks, the brothers Heydon,
the 20-odd fossils of the Legislative Council, the Daily
Telegraph, Koiien with a K, and George Pile’s dog.
Should Briggs he Hanged? `
F. J. Broomfield to The Bulletin
J n . view of the fact that the present N. S. W.
Ministry MS hever disregarded a jury’s recom-
mendation fed mercy of a condamne, it is to be
tegretted that ,hohe such was made in the case of
BriggS, recently death-sentenced in Sydney for
the killing of his sweetheart and her grandmother.
Ihe public are notoriously apathetic in all cases
involving the infliction of the death penalty, and
cannot be prevailed upon to take even a moderate
interest in petitioning for a reprieve unless the
extenuating circumstances are of the most patent
and sensational character. Nevertheless, 2400
persons petitioned for the commutation of the
death-sentence on the unhappy young fellow now
awaiting his doom in Darlinghurst.
* ♦ * •
The chief extenuating circumstances in the
Briggs case are not sensational; nor are they
patent. They appeal to the professional doctor
and to the lawyer who is also a philosopher; and
furnish another instance of the pressing need for
a, more intimate judicial discrimination between
the diverse mental conditions which may have the
same specific result in homicide or other violence.
The commission of the Petersham tragedy illus-
trates the old logical conflict between law and
medicine; between the legal definition which de-
clares that insanity is the inability to distinguish
the right from the wrong, and the medical defini-
tion which declares that insanity is a mental con-
dition creating inability to resist impulse.
• » * *
Surveying the evidence in the light of the in-
vestigations and Conclusions of the great modern
experts in mental diseases, there can be no hesita-
tion in proclaiming the opinion that Briggs was
the victim of hopelessly-diseased perception and of
irresistible impulse. Now, logically, it is not a
question whether the individual criminal is in-
sane, say the advanced alienists, at the exact
period of the commission of a certain type of
crime, so much as whether every man who com-
mits that type of crime is not prima facie insane.
When Briggs committed the double murder, the
obvious outcome of jealous insanity, exasperated
though he may have been to the extremest, he
was just as insane as any other man or Woman
who has committed, or who may commit, a crime
of like nature. _ The present legal definition of in-
sanity is illogical, moreover, inasmuch as pre-
meditation is excluded. Medical experts with
great experience of lunatics bear witness that
mad crimes can be both premeditated and methodi-
cally carried out.
• * * »
It may be admitted that it was in evidence that
Briggs, while in a state of frenzied jealousy,
similar to that of the hanged man Johns, had blis
revolver repaired; and there may be, further,
small reason to doubt that he went to the girl’s
residence with the intention of killing both her
and himself. These circumstances certainly
amounted to premeditation, which the law, as it
stands, makes the distinguishing characteristic of
wilful murder; so that, waiving the question of
the accused’s sanity, the jury could not well, upon
the facts, have found otherwise than it did.
But that it should not have also recommended this
man to mercy is a serious reflection upon its col-
lective head or its collective heart. And, assum-
ing that the head was in fault, let it now be
pointed out that Briggs’s acts—though construc-
tively “deliberate ” —were, nevertheless, the out-
come of a mental state wholly removed from that
of a person, say, who should methodically poison
another by slow degrees, or otherwise do that
which should alone be treated by the law as
‘ ‘ deliberate ” murder.
• * » *
Briggs, it was amply proved, had been for over
a week preceding the killing in a state of such
emotional disorganisation that, even if his plight
did not amount to actual and technical mania, it
would be manifestly absurd to put his irresponsi-
bility upon a level with that of the cdld-blooded
inurderer-for-the-sake-of-gain, such as, say, Frank
Butler or Louisa Collins. Such premeditation
as that evinced by the twain mentioned consti-
tutes “wilful murder ”in the fullest signification
of the term; whereas Briggs, though his final
act occupied but a few seconds, may logically be
said to have been committing it all the time for
days before its consummation. It would, per-
haps, be dangerous to relax the obligation—in
cases of such prima, facie premeditation as
Briggs’s and under existing legal definitions—
formally to convict of “wilful murder,” but the
mercv-recommendation has been made and given
effect to in scores of cases where it was less called-
for than in this. Yet, granting all the weight
attaching to premeditation, it is by no means evi-
dence of a sound mind. Nay, more, the repairing
of the revolver, upon which so much stress was
laid, does not necessarily imply premeditation
even of an unsound mind. Briggs took his
weapon to be repaired on 10th Dec. ; but he did
not quarrel with his sweetheart till the 11th.
Does this not suggest that there need be no neces-
sary connection between the two acts ?
* • * *
A number of persons have come forward since
the conviction to attest to a knowledge of Briggs’s
life - long weak - mindedness. Mr. Albert
Gregory, importer, of Market-street, was at
Darlinghurst both days of the trial to give evi-
dence in this connection, but he was ,not called.
He writes, however, that the convicted man was
in his employ for six months of last year ; that
Briggs, a grown man, was capable of doing only
boy’s work, and that he was regarded by his fellow-
workmen as a simpleton. Mr. James Grant, who
knew Briggs for 11 years, states that he regarded
the prisoner as a person of uneven mental balance,
and that two nights before the commission of the
tragedy he had hallucinations about “ men
Elanted” in the neighborhood of Miss Dutt’s
ouse. Mr. J. 0. Myers, manager of Messrs.
Jewell, Davis and Co.’s business, declares that
the convicted man was dismissed from his employ-
ment for unreasonable and passionate conduct, and
that he was regarded as an irresponsible being.
Several fellow employes say he would publicly
talk his love-affairs over with the smallest boy in
the warehouse and had grandiose ideas concerning
his vocal powers. Other friends and acquaint-
ances talk of cerebral disturbances, delirious
attacks, raving, mental weakness, apparent semi-
idiocy, his mother’s anxiety about his mental con-
dition, etc., and one declares that he knew him as
“ Balmy ” Briggs.
* * * •
Briggs’s mental condition is, however, most
strongly attested by his own incriminating and
incoherent letter, written on Dec. 13. It is a
tisshe of incomprehensible and ungrammatical gib-
bering—a perfect marvel of irritable incoherency,
seeing that it was written by one who had attended
a clergyman’s school for over three years, had been
at Remit,/.’ College, Mount Victoria, for four
years, and at Newington College for another four.
In the pathetic language of his mother, this re-
markable production indicates either one of t\yo
things—that Briggs was mentally incapable of
being educated or that his mind had become
utterly unhinged.
* * * *
Briggs’s case is one demanding the attention of
the expert alienist. Two doctors can send a man
to the frigid shades of a lunatic asylum on their
sworn testimony; but their testimony is of small
avail to the man on trial for his life. Either let us
throw open our hospitals for the mentally-afflicted
—and take our chances as a society—or let us
insist upon our legislators embodying in our
criminal laws some need of protection for the
accused person whose actions remove him from the
pale of reason.
• * * *
The points briefly to be considered by the
Executive in Briggs’s favor are : (1) In the case
under consideration, premeditation is no proof of
sanity. The homicidal maniac is always a pos-
sible outrager of human life. (2) The testimony
of employers, friends and acquaintances prove
Briggs to have been a man of weak and violent
temper, subject to fits of long-continued mental
aberration. (3) After 11 years of high-class educa-
tion, the letter written by the prisoner, upon
which the Crown strongly relied m its prosecu-
tion, would disgrace intellectually a third-form
boy. (4) The evidence of Mr. H. Leach, gun-
smith, of Brickfield-hill, attesting that the revolver
brought to him by Briggs for repair was delivered
at his shop on 10th Dec,, whereas the quarrel with
Miss Dutt took place on the 11th, and the tragedy-
on the 14th. 17
Historical Lies of the Freetrade Press.
“ Hermes ” on a large number of things :
The Freetrade press of Sydney has created a supersti-
tion that Cobden found Britain a small, insignificant
European side-show, and with one wave of his magic
Freetrade talisman created her commercial queen
and three-ball lady of the earth ; and that to become
great, prosperous and self-dependent, like Britain, all
countries that are not already rich must be Freetrade and
otherwise consent to conditions that will secure cheap
money by attracting British capital at low rates of in-
terest. This conclusion is reached by a course of argu-
ment something like this t Under present conditions, all
human energy takes the shape of cash, or credit for cash.
There can be no credit unless there is sufficient bullion to
justify it. Britain, by means Of her Freetrade, has
grabbed the bulk of the world’s capital, Therefore the
first need of a poor country that wishes to be prosperous
is British capital. As she has not sufficient capital of her
Own, she MUST have the use of British capital. And it
is better to submit to any conditions than to lose the in-
estimable benefits of British capital. Unfortunately, the
only condition that seems to tickle the British capitalist
sufficiently is an ironclad mortgage over the bodv, soul,
and property of the borrower. And the state of tile com-
munity that works on borrowed capital is little
better than serfdom. The only countries that
have been conspicuously successful with foreign capital
are England and Germany. Ancient Rome was ruined
by the wealth she stole from the rest of the world ; like-
wise Spain was by the cheap wealth she obtained from
America.
* * * *
When Elizabeth of England, or whoever was the in
visible ghost who directed her policy, set to work to
make England the equal of Spain, she established a rigid
system of Protection. Also, she laid herself out to create
a large reserve of bullion by encouraging piracy on the
Spanish Main and by prohibiting the export of'bullion,
and insisting, wherever possible, that imports should be
paid for with exports, The Government did its best to
secure a balance of trade in favor of England, All English
ships had to be built in England— except those Captured
from the Spanish and other enemies of God, If possible,
they were to be built of English material, and, later on,
when ships Were built of teak, the timber had to be taken
to England, and the ships built there. Farmers were
assisted by heavy corn duties, and bounties Were paid
on the export of cereals to ensure that plenty should be
grown in the island, All foreign goods Were subject to
heavy duties, and one law provided that all English sub-
jects should wear home-made head-gear, It is the cus-
tom of Premier Reid to repeat the Weary old lie of the
S. M, Herald and Daily TelEgr Aim that Freetrade made
Britain great and glorious. Which is absurd ! it was
rigid Protection and foreign plunder that made
England a manufacturing and wealthy nation. His-
tory proves it conclusively. When Premier Reid and
the Sydney “ Weight Dailies ” Say that it was
Freetrade they are either ignorant of English his-
tory or they deliberately tell historical lies. The
Corn Laws were not finally repealed till 1846, Eng-
land had nearly 300 years of Protection and grew great
and rich, She has had only 50 years Of Freetrade, and it
is open to question if Freetrade is responsible fbr ahy
improvement in her position. Nothing but the absolute
Smash-Up of the Empire could have instantly arrested the
momentum that her 300 years Of Protective prosperity
had given her,
Undoubtedly the one great cause of British success was
her cheap foreign capital. Between the years of 1500 and
1549 the wholesale eviction of yeomanry left thousands of
men who were born fighters on the verge of starvation.
Their very existence was a menace to the landed aristo-
cracy who had evicted them. And the gentlemen of
England set to work to solve the great unemployed
problem by killing off the unemployed. An Act of Par-
liament (27, Henry VIII., c. 25) provided that vagrants
were to be first mutilated and then hanged as felons.
They were executed by thousands, for the country was a
sheep-walk, and the woolly kings (like the same kidney
of the present day) employed as few hands as possible.
The executions went on apace, and in 1549 the unem-
ployed flashed into rebellion. Badly armed, without
trained leaders, the sons of the men who had carried the
English flag through Palestine and wiped the floor with
the chivalry of France at Poitiers, Crecy, and Agiricourt,
took the field against the Royal troops, stormed Norwich
twice, besieged Exeter long and stubbornly, and fought
pitched battles again and again. They were just ripe for
another struggle that might have ended in the destruc-
tion of the aristocracy when that ghost of Elizabeth’s
launched them against the Spaniards. How much
foreign (chiefly Spanish) capital Drake and his tribe
brought to England will never be known, but it must
have been an enormous sum. Anyhow it was sufficient
to start England as a manufacturing power, and equip
her to smash the Armada, carry on a long war with
Spain, and assist the United Provinces not a little.
* * * *
The poverty of Spain at the time of the Peninsular
War proves that the wealth she extracted from America,
which did not fall into the hands of the English and
other freebooters, did not remain in the Peninsula. It
went down the great treasure-sink that swallowed the
wealth of Rome, Venice, and every other rich empire that
has flashed across the sky of the world’s history—lndia;
which was another source of Britain’s prosperity. Ever
since the dawn of Time the Oriental has been a hoarder of
precious metals and stones. He has sent his manufac-
tures to the uttermost ends of the earth, and taken in
return bullion and gems which he buried in the soil or
great fortress-treasuries. In 1757 Clive, at the head of a
British army, burst into the treasure house of Bengal,
and viewed the accumulated hoards of centuries. For
those who wish to revel in the details of that treasure
house are they not written in Macaulay ? Clive not only
viewed the vast accumulation, but he seized it and sent
it to England. Warren Hastings continued the work
and plundered the princes and provinces that had
escaped Clive. For 20 years that tide of treasure con-
tinued to pour from India to England. Even by 1760 the
plunder of Bengal had started England on that wonder-
lul and hideous career of invention and rapid production
known as the Factory System and the Age of Steam. The
English used their vast plunder to increase their wealth-
producing powers and appliances, and to lend at high
interest to whoever had anything worth mortgaging.
The result is that a large percentage of the industries of
all nations are run by British capital, and Britain of to-

Turner Will Consider the Matter.
A deputation on behalf of the sweated Melb.
tram employes recently waited on Vic. Premier
Turner. No tram employes were of the num-
ber, for the simple reason that the men are
well aware that any personal attempt to get
justice means prompt “sack.” It was plainly
stated by the deputation that most of those
employes who had given evidence before the
Commission of Enquiry, or who had taken part
in meetings to ventilate their grievances, had
been dismissed upon various pretences, such as
running ahead of time, and so on. The Premier
was much surprised at what he was pleased to
call the “ reprehensible methods of the com-
pany,” and then observed that he was gratified
to learn that the men had not asked for in-
creased wages, as well as reduced hours, as
it would be impracticable for some years to give
them both. Just here The Bulletin would like
to observe that the moderation of the men's
demands is only comparable to that of Premier
Turner’s attitude towards the company. The
men have been retrenched time and again,
until they are now about the most sweated
workers in the province. They are not asking
for increased wages, but simply for their legal
rights, eight hours per day, and the economi-
cal soul of Turner melts with joy at their
moderation. Then the Premier went on to
raise imaginary difficulties. The company
couldn’t carry on business if it granted the
eight hours, and would have to hand back the
trams to the Tramway Trust, and the Trust
wouldn’t be able to give the men better terms,
and so on. Which is bosh ; because, as the
Trust would only have to provide interest and
sinking-fund for the tramway-loans, and would
be under no necessity to pay 12 per cent, divi-
dends or 60 per cent, bonuses, it could not only
carry on the service well and give the
men the eight - hour - day demanded, but
could probably raise their wages and
perhaps lower the fares into the bargain.
Anyhow, all these shadowy possibilities are
apart from the question. The company has
distinctly broken its part of the bargain made
when it got its Act—the part which specifies
that eight hours shall be a working-day, and
anything beyond that shall be paid as over-
time. The penalties recoverable therefor would
make a very handsome surplus in Turner s
next budget. And the careful Turner merely
promised to consult the Cabinet; and said that,
if there were any doubt whether the Act had
carried out the intention of Parliament, he
would let both Houses consider whether or not
the men had been fairly treated. But the ques-
tion is not whether the 48 Incapables of the
Upper House consider the treatment of the
men fair or otherwise, but whether the Supreme
Court considers that same treatment legal—in
other words, whether the company has carried
out its share of the bargain, and, if not, whether
it should not be compelled to do so at
once or the contract be determined forthwith.
In a feeble and irrelevant reply to the state-
ments of the deputation, the Tram Co.
directors assert that they never discharged
a man for giving evidence or for taking part
in meetings. The Bulletin should smile 1
Of course the men who were sacked were sacked
for trivial disciplinary offences, and it was
only an unfortunate coincidence that they
mostly happened to be the men who had given
evidence, etc., and that almost every man who
gives evidence should be discovered shortly
afterwards breaking some rule or other. The
directors further state that it is because the
men are fairly content that they refuse to join
deputations, or take part in agitators meet-
ings, and not from any fear of dismissal ! And
this in face of the fact that over 800, out of
less than 1200 men in the service, recently met
to unanimously demand the eight hours to
which they are entitled. In short, the men
have demanded this right ; the commission of
enquiry has recommended the granting there-
of, and—most important of all—the original
Tram wavs Act, embodying the bargain between
the municipalities and the company, expressly
stipulates for it. In this matter the I ram way
Co. is a law-breaker, and Premier Turner,
who won’t enforce the law, is tacitly its accom-
plice, or at least its apologist.

Pulling Dungey Through.
The last lingering doubt as to whether Detec-
tive Dungey and colleague Dora Bromley
would ever be brought to trial at Melb. Grim.
Court was disposed of last week. They were
tried in a farcical manner, and they were found
not guilty of doing the thing which they un-
doubtedly did, and nobody up to now seems
dumosed to make a healthy demonstration by
smashing the windows of Smellbourne’s new
W Courts. From the outset of the Dungey-
BRdiEY case it was clear that the law had
decked to deny the private prosecutor any
£eJ satisfaction. The controllers of the law
tire the Ct-own Law Dept., the
a much smaller degree the Magistrates and
when the prosecutor of Dungey and BroMleY
applied to the aforesaid authorities for abSl ;
ance in obtaining the conviction of t o
law-breakers, he found b,m«lf
snubbed every time. Lhe law had be
guilty of contemptible conduct by e
ploying two people to commit a felony in the
Alleged interests of public morality, and the Law
decided to put a brazen face on the matter.
For reasons fully explained in The Bulletin,
the prosecutor of the Law’s myrmidons afore-
said was allowed to take his case into the Crimi-
nal Court. Having let him arrive there with
his little load of preliminary costs upon his
presumptuous back, the Law laughed at him.
Judge Hodges, apparently anxious to put the
prisoners at their ease, lost no time in assuring
the prosecution that he didn’t intend to lnnic
any punishment, even though the charge of
criminal conspiracy were proved up to the
hilt ! As a matter of fact, the truth of the
charge could not be disputed on com-
mon - sense lines of argument, . but t e
Law had private reasons for wishing to
preserve its Dungey from a verdict of guilty,
therefore Judge Hodges proceeded to talk
tommy-rot to the jury calculated, if not in-
tended, to procure a verdict against the facts.
“ In our hearts we are all satisfied,” said his
Honor, “ that Dungey and Bromley were
working harmoniously together, and meant to
trap these two people ” (the abortionists now in
prison) “ if possible. But the accused persons
had to be convicted, not upon feeling, but upon
evidence which convinced the understanding,
&c., &c. At the conclusion of this outrage on
common-sense Judge Hodges sent the jury to
consider its verdict, and whilst the jury was
leaving the box the bewigged partisan pointedly
ordered the warder in charge of Dungey
and Bromley to release the precious pair
from custody. Under the circumstances it
was not so very remarkable that the
jury, having wrestled with the sophistries of
Hodges for 90 minutes, came to the conclusion
that it might as well find Dungey and
Bromley not guilty of the legal crime which,
in any case, was to go unpunished. On behalf
of Judge Hodges and the committing magis-
trate (whose tactics have been previously
spoken of in The Bulletin), it will be said
that Dungey and Bromley deserved well of
the community when they plotted to put a
couple of abortionists into prison. People in
general are always ready to echo the Law’s
solemn cant concerning the particular wicked-
ness of the one crime which is invited by its
“ victims,” and which in 99 cases out of 100 is
a matter for all-round congratulation among
the guilty parties. But the fact that the Law
treats abortionists as heinous offenders doesn t
make the trapping of them by Dungey-
Bromley means any the less condemnable,
not to say hateful. The act of procuring
abortion may take, and not infrequently does
take, the form of an act of individual kindness,
perpetrated out of pity for a woman s distress.
Given a soft-hearted doctor, a scheming rival
practitioner, and an eager detective with a
clever female accomplice, and we have the pos-
sibility of a successful crime-trap, ten times
more wicked than the legal crime itself.
Attorney-General Isaacs, deserves censure for
having sanctioned the illegal action of police-
man Dungey and his degraded accomplice.
Panton, P.M., and Judge Hodges are to be
condemned for their indecent treatment of the
friendless prosecutor in this case. Abortion,
for all that hypocritical authorities may say of
its sinfulness, is the most easily procured crime
on the Australian statute-books, and the duty
of Judge Hodges and co. was to study, not
the convenience of policeman Dungey, but the
best interests of the public who pray “Law,
deliver us from temptation.”

Laud for the People.
Ex-Legislator writes: —
In a recent Bulletin the question was asked, “ What is
it that Australia lacks that prevents it being a great
country?” Well, to this deponent, who has seen a big
part of it, it is a great country, but it might be made a
better one if more people were spread over its surface.
To put people on the land has been the great aim of every
real democrat since legislation was brought to bear upon
the subject, and since the Robertson Act of ’6l, there
have been many efforts made by statesmen and others to
make it possible for the “ little man ” to have his bit of
land. In 1884, to quote a personal experience, I assisted
in passing Farnell’s measure, the most striking features
of which were, Ist, the partition of N.S.W. into three
great divisions, each subject to special provisions, and
2nd, the division of the Crown leases, chiefly in the
Central Division, into two parts, the one being secured
to the squatter, as that loud-voiced Boeotian, McEliione,
used to call him, and the other, fixed for a minor term,
to be afterwards cut up into selections. We of the
popular party tried to have the runs cut up so as to allow
the selector of 1898 and onwards to have a fair share
of the frontages, but, despite this, it was manifest that
most of the areas were “peacocked” in the interest of
the larger holder. Now that the latter’s time of giving
up the leases has arrived, he is sending his deputations
down to the Minister for Lands asking for yet another
half of the balance due to the selector, for an indefinite
period—briefly, as long as the Minister will grant it to
him. But I think the lessees need not worry Mr. Carru-
thers, for he is doing their work for them in his own
way. Everywhere there is an outcry for land ; at Dubbo
lately there were 215 applications for 13 blocks ; at
Warren, a month previously, there were 97 applications
for a paltry gamble of three waterless blocks ; and so on
wherever land is put up that is worth the taking. And
this brings me to another point of my grievance. When
the land was to be thrown open for selection, according
to the ’B4 Act, it was intended that the frontages should
go to the selector, but the traditions of the
Lands Department are opposed to any such ar-
rangement, and where the law cannot be evaded
by securing the land to the runholderliy a lease, the same
end is obtained by declaring the frontage a reserve,
which reserve is leased to the runholder, practically in
perpetuity. I enclose vou a map of Willie run, on the
Lower Macquarie, where 80,000 acres were to be thrown
open in 1898. After numberless postponements, 11 selec-
tions, comprising a little over 30,000 acres, have been put
into the market, so to say, to be raffled for next May, and,
as pointed out, the river frontages, with one solitary ex-
ception, are carefully reserved to the manifest and sole
benefit of the station-owners ! Finally, for this screed is
already too long, I have to assert that the action of the
Lands' Department is crippling settlement in the Central
Division, and that the intention of a fairly beneficent
Act, the best points of which are ignored by those set to
administer it, is rendered null by maladministration. If
Mr. Carrutiiers’ words of the other day, in reply to the
deputation spoken of, are true, let him throw open a
million acres of the agricultural land of the Central Divi-
sion for selection in one day. It would, perhaps, surprise
him, but not the writer, to see every acre of it taken up
by men whose good faith is unimpeachable. But who ex-
pects to see Mr. CARRUTHKR* make such a departure 1
The Council’s Reason.
The reason given by N.S.W. Leg. Council for
its amendment providing that N.S.W. shall
not federate unless with the permission and
concurrence of Queensland :
The Legislative Council insists on the amendment in
Clause 7, because, by the inclusion of Queensland, New
South Wales will form the centre, instead of one end, of
the federated States, and because the voting power of
the federated States will be more nearly equalised.
The first reason is very beautiful. Nothing
more about the alleged desire to make the
Federation complete, or about high-tariff
Queensland being the natural ally of Freetrade
N.S.W. The real reason sticks out like the
beak of Israel coming up out of Egypt; if
Queensland comes in there will be a chance to
demand that the capital shall be near Sydney
“soas to be central ”; with Queensland out, no
one could make that argument look feasible.
There is such a yearning in the hearts of the
Sydney provincialists to “consider the just
claims of Queensland.” Not by putting
the capital at Armidale, so as to be
equally distant from Sydney and Bris-
bane, or about Cobar to be equi-distant
from Brisbane and Adelaide, or about Too-
woomba, in Queensland, so as to be half-way
down the east coast, but by planting it just at
Sydney, so as to be as near as possible half-way
between Brisbane and Melbourne. The feeling
that a brutal wrong will be done to Queensland
unless it gets the Federal city planted (at Syd-
ney) just half-way between its own capital and
Melbourne keeps the N.S,W. provincialists
awake most of the night. The rest of it they
can’t sleep through thinking of the wrong that
would be done to Victoria unless the Federal
city was planted (at Sydney) just half-way be-
tween its capital and Brisbane. And they can t
enjoy their food by day when they remember
the irreparable injury that will be inflicted on
Westralia unless the Commonwealth’s political
centre is located at Sydney, so as to be just
half-way between Perth and Fiji—which may
come in some day.
A Broken Joss.
Old, sturdy John Forrest has comparatively
few friends now in the VVestralian press. He
is a fallen idol—a Joss that has burst, in conse-
quence whereof the straw is hanging out of
its forlorn stomach and its glass eye has
dropped in the dust —a shattered drum and a
discredited tin-god generally. If the Opposition
had a really able and vigorous Democrat as
leader, the remaining years of Big John’s Pre-
miership could be counted on the thumb of the
armless man. Since the boom fell through the
papers that used to adore John the Great now
rage about his misgovernment, his lack of fore-
sight, his deficit, his great loan commitments,
his inability to find work for the unemployed,
and his general dunder-headedness. Forrest,
even at his worst, deserves better treatment.
He mistook his boom, as Parkes and Gillies
and M‘ll wraith and Vogel did theirs, for
permanent prosperity, and the local press
sooled him on. He went in for huge loan
undertakings in the cheerful belief that the
population would always keep increasing as it
was doing, and while things went well the local
papers grovelled to their John with a great
grovel. And they mostly left him to hold the
great, shapeless baby all by himself when the
crash came. Hardly one of them told him in
the good days that his boom was only a tem-
porary fraud and that his Coolgardie water*
scheme was too big for a small community to
totter under; but now that the scheme is
started, and it is either necessary to borrow a
disastrous two millions to finish it with or else
drop the money already expended, the windows
of vocabulary are opened, and it rains condem-
nation on Big John for 40 days and 40 nights.
John himself, as a plucky and moderately dis-
honest ass—moderately dishonest in the politi-
cal sense—doesn’t in the least know what to do
in such a strait as the present, for he never was
a politician of much constructive ability ; but
at least he keeps his head to the storm and his
tail up, and puts a brave face on things. And
in some respects he deserves better luck than
he is having.

Throssell, M.L.A., Minister for Lands in
W.A., on Federation :
While I am an ardent Fedeirationist, and have given
the subject great attention, my own opinion, as a private
individual, and as the Commissioner for Crown Lands,
who has the responsibility of settling the people on the
land, is that we had better wait awhile. I know that
this view is the unpopular one. You will be addressed in
sentimental language by those in favor of immediate
Federation, but it will be your duty—having to provide
for your boys and girls, and to make arrange-
ments for their future, to look closely into the
matter, and to ask yourselves, “ Will it pay?” We are
only nine years old, so to speak—for it is only that tune
since we were granted Responsible Government—and are
we able, with our puny development, with our 200,000
acres under crop, to compete with people having the
benefit of vast loans, of Protection, of railways, of
mineral discoveries, and of manufactories long estab-
lished? ... I fear the answer will be that we shall have
to wait awhile.
Vast loans! Protection!! Mineral discoveries!!!
Why, these three sum-up the whole faith, con-
dition, and status of W.A.—the Land of Wait
Awhile ! And this at a turnip-show at Kelms-
cott—a rising bush-town peopled by four men
and some chickens !
Melb. Argus showed a feeble disposition to
speak the Truth about Judge Hodges’s ill-
treatment of the Dungey - Bromley case,
whilst the Age affected to regard the pro-
ceedings as a glorious vindication of the
Law, and in a sub-leader jubilated thus:
“It is said that there was some intention
of obtaining a royal pardon (Joe Chamber-
lain refused to entertain the proposal Ed. B.)
for the detective and his assistant; but it is far
more satisfactory that the issue should have
been tried, and thus effectually disposed of, by
a jury, since we are not likely to hear of
another private prosecution on similar grounds.
Yet there was some risk in the course taken,
since it is impossible to foretell what a jury
will do.” Artless prattle ! Judge Hodges,
by ordering the prisoners out of custody before
the jury left the court to consider its verdict^
had reduced the aforesaid “ risk ” to a 50 to I
chance. And, by the way, it seems that the
issue was not effectually disposed of. The
baffled prosecutor is now going for widow
Bromley “ on her own.”
+
The final polling at Q. elections justifies the
prophets by leaving parties almost as before.
Ministerialists number 40; Labor, 23; and
Opposition, 7 ; with two seats doubtful. The
Labor gain is thus three seats, and the Govt,
still has a substantial majority, as anticipated.
The quality of the electorates—especially in
the metropolitan and agricultural districts—is
still too rotten to make any better result
attainable, especially in view of the Q. pro-
perty-vote and bulcocking systems; but in a
few years, if labor modifies its platform suffi-
ciently to catch the moderate vote, there
should be a change. A Labor Parnell would
hasten the change considerably; but, so far, he
has not risen from the ranks.
♦
Premier Kingston has horrified the stodgy
South Australians who swear by the Constoo-
shun and don’t know what it is by frankly
telling a Methody deputation that he isn’t
going to disturb the present system of educa-
tion, although he personally favors a capitation
errant. Three years ago the province voted the
grant down by three to one; and Premier
Kingston says he is going to respect that ver-
dict until it is reversed. Immediately he is
howled at to “preserve his self-respect” and
resign in order that men whose views coincide
with the majority’s on this one point may step
in. It doesn’t occur to these howlers that in
nine points out of ten Kingston’s policy is the
majority’s policy, and that the other fellows’
isn’t; what they ask is that the province shall
put up with being misrepresented on nine
points in order that it may be fairly repre-
sented on one.
No Australian working men should accept a
situation in Westralia, or go there on any
terms at present. The Government is openly
allied with the most reactionary employers,
and recklessly bent on crushing the mere work-
ing man at every opportunity. In Victoria at
the great strike the Gillies-Deakin Govern-
ment covertly combined with the ship-owners—
but it did not openly enter into active hostili-
ties against unionists. Yet this is what is now
happening in Westralia. The railway depart-
ment is in active treaty against the lumpers,
and all workers connected with shipping. Be
it remembered that the majority of these men
have not averaged 255. a week for a very long
time past, while 355. is a sum almost unheard
of for one week’s work. Then provisions are
dear, house-rents high, and houses uncomfort-
able, the climate trying for men and dangerous
for children. The workman with a wife and
family in Westralia is to be pitied. He has
nothing to look forward to but depression. He
has no vote, no friends, no security, no com-
fort.

“ Alta ”: This letter from an alleged “ white ’’
farmer on the Clarence to a kanaka “boy
throws an interesting light on how the white
farm laborer is being cut out of employment by
the aliens :
Jack Thengli Maclean.— Please Jack,— l write you
this letter on Thursday night 2 March. I want 4 boys
come down on Saturday start pull corn on Monday. It
any more boys there some can come to chip cane by con-
tract. Don’t forget 4 hoys come Saturday. I want to
pull corn now it. is getting too ripe so come now I can t
wait any longer. I want 4 boys pull corn and if some
more got no work plenty work here clean some cane.
When we pull corn and clean cane I want you all strip
cane so if you want the job 4 boys pull corn and some 3
or 4 come clean cane come now or you might lose the
cane strip. If all not ready some boys come first. If all
boys don’t like wages you got plenty boys finish pull corn
quick. You can take contract if you like but 4 hoys
come Saturday with lolanthe if you take contract you
can take boat Sunday or Monday and get what you want.
Don’t forget send boys down Saturday, and you come if
you ready. I want to pull corn, strip cane, clean some
cane and chip some cane, all one job want plenty boys
and if you take contract finish quick. If boys not ready
you come see me Saturday if some ready send them down
Come quick now if you don t come now Indian men
might come and take your job. •
The alternative of being compelled to get In-
dian workers if the nigs, wouldn t take on the
job is a stroke of genius almost equalled by the
anxiety of the writer to get his farm-work
done by black labor and by contract. And
N.S.W. keeps its white men from starving by
painting fences and shifting sand !
Cheerful strain from Brisbane Courier re
recent hurricane :
The vast majority of those drowned were Asiatics and
Polynesians, most of whom were single men. Of over
400 lives lost, not more than 12 or 14 appear to have been
whiles. Those who would have diving carried on wholly
by white men may now see what an awful blow would
have been dealt to" Queensland had 400 families been now
sorrowing for loved ones lost.
If this sort of logic is to hold good, then the
mining industry, which is so eminently fatal to
human life, should be carried on by Asiatics
also, so that no European families may
be left destitute by explosions and kindred
disasters. Also it would be well if the whole
of our mercantile marine were manned by
dirty heathen, so that no white sailor’s wife
may be left sorrowing when the coasting boats
go down. For the same reason it would be
well if our stockmen were Japs., our soldiers
kanakas, our firemen and engineers Malays,
and so on. What the Courier means is this—
“ Only niggers and yellow-boys. Let ’em
drown ! What matter ? ”

Controversy on moral aspects of the payment
of members question in N.S.W. Leg. Assembly
may now be taken as closed. Every man jack
in the present House pockets his wage. When
the Act passed doughty moralists announced
that, being opposed to the principle, they
would not touch the loot with a walking-stick.
For a while they backed up their brave lan-
guage with a show of resistance, but one by
one they slid into the rut and clutched the
monthly £25. It appears from a recent return
that the entire moral valor of that period re-
turned to the State something less than £lOOO.
Adrian Knox gave back £274 3s. 9d. ; Reid
renounced £513 6s. Bd. ; Tom Rose repudiated
£l3 155., and M'Millan scorned £lO6 15s. 4d.;
or, in all, £9oBos. 9d. ! The haughty moralists
raised such a clamor at the time that the
average citizen expected the renunciations te
total £30,000 at least.

Naturally there was no lack of suggestioil
that Thekla Dubberke’s refusal to apply for any
of the boot-trunk-tragedy money was aii arrange;
ment with Pratt; the “financier” who collected
the whole £550. The average man in the street is
nothing if not cynically suspicious. The truth
seems to be that Dubberke had a genuine repug-
nance to the idea of making anyndoney out of her
friends’ conviction, whilst Pratt went for what he
could get without considering the girl in the
matter. He had only a slight acquaintance with
her, her visit to his office brought him into un-
pleasant notoriety, and he flew to the cash for con-
solation.

Judge Hodges, in influencing the jury to
bring a verdict of not-guilty for Dungey and
Bromley, was reduced to awful extremities of
false argument. For instance—“ These two people
were working together for a certain purpose, but
we are not convinced that Dungey intended to
procure the persons Duvalli and Potter to commit
an offence, but merely to allow them to go so far in
their proceeding as to brine/ themselves within the
criminal law.” The Bulletin would like to pin
Judge Hodges against the office wall and ask him
to explain the difference between procuring per-
sons to commit an off; nee and engaging them to
do something for which they could be convicted
and sent to prison. If the offence wasn’t pro-
cured by Dungey and Bromley there was no
offence at all. The woman Bromley’s share in the
abortion arrangements would rank as part of the
offence under Maoriland law.
At the anti-Federal meeting in Sydney
Town Hall George Dibbs, ex-Republican, ex-
leader of the Protectionist party, ex-Protectionist
Premier, actually stood up and said this (Daily
Telegraph report):—
The Legislative Council harl also protested against the
Braddon blot. That clause was one of the most compli-
cated puzzles he (Sir George) had ever tackled, although
he thought he knew something about figures. The
“ blot ” was practically beyond his comprehension until
he had received light from one who had full time to study
the situation created. The Braddon blot meant that the
people of this colony, supposed to be living under the
blessings of Freetrade and a simple tariff, would forfeit
their individual liberties and be taxed somehow or other
to the extent of over £1,000,000 to carry on the Federal
Government. (Cries of “No ” and “ Yes.”)
The “ Blessings of Freetrade ! ” And the Pro-
tectionist leader and Protectionist Premier crying
to the people not to federate because it may bring
along Protection—the thing he swears he believes
in!! G. ex-Republican Dibbs is “ex” more
things than any other politician in this country;
he is the X-est public man in Australia. And
now it seems he is an ex-Protectionist among the
rest. Also he is an ex-Treasurer who says he
doesn’t understand a simple little clause setting
forth that 75 per cent, of the customs and excise
revenue of each province shall be handed back to
that province to pay interest on its debt, or
applied by the Federal Government for the same
purpose. Truly a financier who can’t comprehend
a trifle like that is liable to become “ ex ” at any
moment.

George Rignold’s Shakesperian venture
started brilliantly at Sydney Criterion. Nothing
of a more cheerful character has happened to
“Othello” in this country during the last ten
years than Rignold’s revival of Saturday last. It
was splendidly staged; the leading characters
were well done ; anil George Rignold was 25 years
younger than when last he appeared in Sydney,
and he put his whole soul into the old-time
Venetian woe. The years of Rignold’s life that
the cheap melodrama has eaten were truly a
beart-breaking waste. That big actor is no better
than anybody else in melodrama—in fact, he is a
vast amount worse than some ; and when he can
do work like “Othello ” it is sad to reflect on the
time he threw away clearing himself of the
vulgar, sordid aspersion that arose through the
money having been found in the pocket of his long
Sunday coat. The brown warrior who took the
middle of the Criterion stage on Saturday is a
big, impressive, convincing personality, and his
splendid elocution is a surprise to many—he never
got much chance to elocute in the days when the
stolen money was always being found in his
pocket. It is difficult to say that he missed a
point anywhere, or to suggest how anything
could have been done better. Harry Diver’s lago
is equally good. It is certainly the cleverest
thing this clever actor has done in Sydney, and it
is one of the best renderings of lago that the
Society for being Very Tired of Shakespeare can
recall at the present moment. Diver’s lago is a
warm, friendly person, with a persuasive stoop,
and a gentle voice, and soothing hands which
seem always ready to pour holy oil on his enemy.
Nobody matters very much except these two, and
the excellence of Othello, with his square,
brown countenance looming up over his flowing
robes, and the cleverness of his well-dressed
deceiver, make success certain.
• • * •
The balance of the cast consists of reason-
ably good material. Johnson Weir’s Cassio is a
strong character without many fine shades upon it.
Miss Lilian Wheeler’s Desdemona might be a
little less faint and a little better-defined, without
doing herself any injury ; she leaves a memory of
a pretty, fragile being with a saint-like mass of
light, drooping hair —but still there is no serious
objection to her. And the ever-useful Miss Watts-
Phillips, as Emilia, is a thorough artist all through.
* * * *
The “ Othello ” revival ought to have a
good run—if it isn’t killed by the arid newspaper
controversy of the erudite ghouls who always want
to dissect Shakespeare’s characters, and publish
their entrails in two Columns of S.M. Hebald,
and draw learned deductions from nothing at all
about the hero’s digestion, and his dog, and his
wife’s dressmaker. For instance, the fact
that Othello proposes to borrow his wife’s
handkerchief on the ground that a “rheum”
affects him is the sort of point which opens
up space for great wastes of dry and track-
less inference, wherein the ordinary playgoer is
liable to perish for want of water, so that his
bones will be found there after many days. It
suggests that a Venetian general of those days
hadn’t a handkerchief of his own, and that he
possibly hadn’t a pocket to put one in; that he
wasn’t gentlemanly enough to care whose hand-
kerchief he used ; that his wife, who didn’t seem
at all surprised at the request, was quite accus-
tomed to lending the article in question ; and that
when his wife wasn’t about to lend him a hand-
kerchief he would probably have to use a leaf off a
tree. Matters like this, when earnestly looked
into, can be made to fill a good deal of space.

The new co. which opened Sydney’s long-
deserted Opera House on Saturday night isn’t
noticeably different, after all, from a number of
other companies which have ‘ ‘ done a perish ” at the
same luckless establishment. The house wasn’t
noticeably different either. It was generally
understood that wealth was being poured out like
water to brighten up the antiquated establish-
ment, and the establishment does certainly look
as if it had had a more or less perfunctory wash
behind the ears; but in all essentials it is still
the same quaintly-constructed and ungainly em-
porium. Notably the three painted angels, who
seem to have slept in their hair, still totter at an
obtuse angle on the curtain. The co. opened with
“Round the World in Eighty Days,” but some
unauthorised person has hashed Jules Verne’s
clever story out of all shape and knowledge, and
damaged it badly in the process. Some of his
alterations —notably his duels, and his stuffed
snakes, and his Egyptian Pasha who seems to
spend his time doing police duty on a wharf, and
his Indian cpieen, who is kidnapped and spends
four years in slavery (this within a day or two’s
journey of Calcutta), and his thief who steals two
million francs from the Bank of England (the
British ■£ has been abolished, and even Phileas
Fogg talks in francs) are childish, or thereabout.
The»co. consists principally of unknown people
who appear consumed by a great sorrow. Barring
W. J. Montgomery as P. Fogg, Edmund Duggan
and Miss Minna Phillips, there isn’t one in the
crowd concerning whom this writer can lay his
feverish hand on his chest and say, conscientiously,
that he remembers having previously seen that
person on any stage. “Round the World itt
Eighty Days ” is useful mainly for spectacular
purposes, and there being only a limited amount
of spectacle in the present version, even with the
baggy python thrown in, it is difficult to see why
it should exist at all,

Sydney Lyceum re-opens on Saturday
(April 1) under Charles Holloway’s management
with “ Our Guardian Angel.” Apropos , the pre-
sent writer discovers that in his last notice
of this co., when it played the “Shadows” at
Sydney Royal, he alluded to William Gourlay in
a promiscuous way, sometimes as William and
sometimes as John. He gladly takes this oppor-
tunity to explain that the bright and spidery
gentleman in question is William and not John—
that he is emphatically Bill—that he has never
been anybody else than Bill ; in fact, anybody
J”?o looks at him will see that he was named
William simply because it was impossible to do
hnn adequate justice by calling him any other
as J°hn Gourlay is absolutely unlike
William, and William is still more unlike John—
in fact, John doesn’t resemble William on any
point, and William is at least twice as dis-
similar, and their unlikeness is so phenomenal
that -The Bulletin has often been wakened up in
the middle of the night by complete strangers,
who wanted to point out the utter want of resem-
blance between William and John—this paper
really can’t imagine how the mistake occurred.
Anyhow, it trusts this explanation, however in-
adequate, will satisfy William, who has been
writing on the subject, and that he will consider
his identity as William fully established. If it
isn’t fully established, The Bulletin will estab-
lish it some more if it has to cripple somebody in
doing it. And if the same mistake happens again,
this paper will go out and abolish John altogether.

Miss Pattie Browne, who is now, as every-

The reliable old show at the Tivoli exhibits
no sign of disaster on its azure brow. Cora
Caselli goes on doing about the most remarkable
things that any woman with only two legs to aim
at the stars ever accomplished, though sometimes
when Cora is in the middle of her maddest dance
she leaves the impression of being a lady with
eight legs or more. Dante also remains at his old
stand—the Palace —where he seems to have taken
root indefinitely.

leon’s Court was favorably commented on in this
paper when she hung her boiled shirt on the
ancestral tree in Melbourne, and The Bulletin
bespeaks her a favorable welcome in Sydney.

Speaking as a man who loathes circuses,
the present ink-spiller desires to say that Fitz-
geralds’ present circus is a dashed good circus as
circuses go. In his private opinion the best of
circuses doesn’t go far, but, anyhow, the one under
discussion is as good a one as the writer ever hopes
to see. These remarks, coming from a man who
would rather never see another circus as long as he
lives, may seem like faint praise, but they are not
meant that way. All the Fitzgeralds’ performers
are artists—the horses, the Jappy acrobats, Ajax
(the gentleman who swallows himself and then
goes to sleep inside), the lady on the revolving
globe, the trapeze damsel, and, above all, the
hurdle-racing tiger, who is, probably, the most
astonishing show of the lot. The writer almost
thinks he could enthuse over the hurdle-racing
tiger, and he may possibly do so at great length
—next week.

The feature of the Broughs’ farewell week
at Melbourne Princess’s was a revival of “Mrs.
Tanqueray,” the one problem play (so-called) that
promises to break out occasionally when all its
gloomy kindred are withered and gone. Pinero’s
masterpiece brought back memories of B. and B.
times, three ladies of the first “ Tanqueray ” cast
resuming their places on the bill, whilst a new
Mrs. Cortelyon (Miss Bessie Thompson) proved to
be even a little brighter than her two predecessors
in the part. The performance on the female side
came fully up to the old mark. Mrs. Brough, as
Paula, doesn’t get the sympathy which Miss
Olliffe wrung from a Melbourne audience,
but she puts in a lot of admirable work,
and baners the furniture and things with
real dramatic force. The actress is impres-
sive, though not convincing. Miss Grace
Noble has strengthened her pretty picture of
Saint Ellean, the somewhat human daughter of a
frigid pietist, the girl who believes that a voice
from Heaven prompted her to leave the convent
and comfort her earthly father; whereas it was
merely the voice of Nature telling her to go forth
into the world and find a cuddlesome young man.
Miss Temple, Miss Thompson aforesaid, Brough
as Cayley Drummle, and Leslie Victor as the
baronet who loses count of his drinks, are always
satisfactory. Joseph Carne’s treatment of the
Aubrey Tanqueray character is tame and monoto-
nous, but a handsome, gentlemanly failure never-
theless. It may be fairly said for Carne that he
surpasses Titheradge in the matter of profile, and
looks more like a chivalrous sentimentalist at the
age of forty-three.

The Princess’s will reopen on Saturday
with “The Belle of New York,”a musical comedy
which boomed in ’Murka and London, and is con-
fidently expected to hit this country hard A new
company from New York has come along to do the
deed, also the co. will be assisted by Albert Whelan,
and a cluster of nice local girls, and the Firm’s
best endeavors for a gorgeous success.

On Friday the big house will be closed for a sacred
rehearsal of “Woman and Wine,” and on Satur-
day that “ stirring narrative of life in Paris ” will
be played for the first time in Australia on the
usual Blandolt scale of expenditure. A French
tenor has joined the co., and numerous scenes of
foreign dissipation have been painted by Brunton.

The Easter bill at Melb. Bijou includes
the musical Leslie Brothers (who are always
welcome, more especially after a long absence),
beggy Pryde, Fred Poplar, with the tailor’s
dummy and a genial tendency to mooch abowt,
Whitburn and numerous other people of more or
less perceptible merit. Some of the attractions
are perhaps not quite as astounding as they might
be, but taking the thin with the thick of it
Rickards’show is a large return for the money,
and the scribe who gets there gratis comes out
again with a sort of half-conviction that he has
made two-and-sixpence profit.

Ernest Moffit, the most unassuming of
Melbourne’s artistic young men, allowed himself
to die of peritonitis last week. Moffit was best
known as secretary to Marshall Hall’s Conserva-
torium of Music, and right-hand man to that fiery
particle. His name figured from time to time in
a bottom corner of a newspaper advt., but apart
from his connection with Marshall Hall, the young
sec. had made a little mark as a pen-and-ink
draughtsman and a clever musician and instru-
mentalist. He played many parts—including the
trombone—and did all things modestly. Poor
young Moffit!

Melb. Alexandra has arranged to celebrate
the day after Good Friday by throwing open its
dusty doors to the g.p. at popular prices. Duncan
Macallum takes the management of the forlorn
hope on this occasion, and he will produce “ Lost
in London,” with old friend Augustus Glover as
principal item in the struggle. The Cosgrove
Comedy Co., which made some fitful appearances
in Melbourne last year, will try a further splutter
at _St. George’s Hall on Saturday. Also, some-
thing is going to happen at the Town Hall arid
the Exhibition Building On Sunday, the 31st.
Gounod’s “ Mors et Vita ” will be reverently dealt
with by the Philharmonic Society in the hall
aforesaid, whilst Walter Bentley, at the other
place, recites the “book” of the Oberammergau
Passion-play against a panoramic background.

A curious coincidence in connection with the suicide of
William Miller and Miss Allardyce comes to The Bulle-
tin’s knowledge. The night before Miller arrived at New-
castle, the handsome singer whom he married in the fes-
tive days when he was “ Lord Leamington,” of Hobart,
put up at the very hotel in which the deed was done, but
was not aware of the vicinity of the gay deceiver till she
read of his death after she had reached Sydney.
Brough positively declared in his late Melb. advts.—
“Absolutely the last production of foregoing plays in
Melbourne.” The “foregoing plays” are all favorites
and the most profitable of Brough’s bagful, which seems
to mean absolutely last production of foregoing players.
Brough must be anxious to go again where glory waits
him—to India.
The stupidest criticism (intended for a compliment)
that Titheradge received from any London paper was the
remark that he acted somewhat in the style of Wilson
Barrett. Ye gods! They ought to see Ti'th. in W. B.’s
original character of the Silver King to appreciate the
vast difference between the styles of the two men—and
then see him in a light comedy.
A certain clever musician, who plays Melb. Town Hall
organ occasionally, was up at a police-court last
week, on a charge of insulting some policemen. He
didn’t throw stones, or create a disturbance of any kind—
he merely remarked, in passing, that the policemen were
“ things.” It seems hard for a musical genius, with (or with-
out) a drop of whisky in him, to be fined 30s. for expressing
his opinion about things in general. Also, there is sadness
in the thought that the musician has now promised to
take the pledge, for with the organists of this world
success has usually spelt suction.
The benefit performance for Maccabe realised only
£207, but a number of private subscriptions have been
added to the pool, so it is expected that the fund will
suffice to buy an annuity of £2 a week for poor old Fred.
Better than leaving him to die in a workhouse, anyhow.
Henry Dobson took the chair at hairy, cheeky globe-
trotter “Oliver Bainbridge’s” lecture at Hobart, with
Crisp, M.P., on one side. As the talk went on, Dobson
and Crisp looked as if they were being sentenced to death
by Madden, C.J., and informed that the rest lay with the
Executive. Dobson had told the audience he was there
because Bainbridge was a graduate of a famous University,
and took an enormous interest in education ! But the
absurd little Cornstalk, in his hour-and-a-half’s discourse,
said never a word about the famous University or educa-
tion of any sort; he made a dismal failure, and told jokes
that were old when Joe Miller was young. When the
lecturer sat down, Crisp and Dobson bolted without word
or sign.
“ Weary ” : Your correspondent “ 8.E.” refers you back
to the early ’7o’s for evidence of Clement Scott’s free and
independent theatrical criticisms. The par. that “B.E. ”
quarrels with merely treated of the latter-day Scott, who
threatened to tour Australia on the strength of his long
association with the London D.T. The D.T. notices for
many years past have been of such a character that the
profession —in the words of Beerbohm Tree took
“ critic ” Scott into their sacred circle and treated him as
a dear brother. No man can write reasonably honest
notices and be regarded as a dear brother by mummers
or managers.
A ghastly farce is the average cable concerning
agreements obtained and successes scored by Australian
mummers in England. Such items are usually mere
charity-notices given by the compassionate cable'man to
the poor struggling mummer who must advertise or die.
Present scribe (who himself learned on the spot some-
thing about the system) was t’other day talking to an
Australian lately returned from abroad. “ I see X has
got a good engagement,” this scribe observed. “ Bah ! ”
exclaimed the traveller, “ I was one day in a New York
street on a bitter, cold day, and a man came up to me
holding out his hand with—‘Don’t you recognise me,
Mr. ? I’m X , from Australia.’ He was gaunt
and famine-stricken, and was buttoned up to the chin in
a long over-all—with evidently little or nothing beneath
it bar skin and bone. Told me he had mostly walked
overland all the way from San Francisco, and
had had an awful time. Asked me to procure him
work. I replied I’d speak to (a big’ entrepreneur)
and get him into the chorus; hut, would you believe it,
this spectre of famine wasn’t taking any chorus ; though
many a fine artist has been glad to get such a chance.
Since then he lias, I believe, got a billet —probably at two
or three pounds a week ; that’s what I should expect
from what I know of the crowd he’s with, and it’s been
duly cabled out, conveying the idea that that poor devil
of a starveling has made a perfect triumph. Another
musical mummer, concerning whom I have lately read
cables and paragraphs in ‘Our London Letter,’ met me
in the Strand, London, and asked me, for God’s sake, to
give him a shilling, as his family were starving. The poor
wretch had walked in from a mean suburb four-and-a-
half miles away, on the off-chance of meeting some
acquaintance who would part him a silver coin. God
help the average Australian mummer who goes to Eng-
land to astonish the natives !’’
London D.T. speaks of Ada Reeve as “the nearest
available successor to Nellie Farren,” which is just about
as stupid as a comparison between Peggy Pryde and
Nellie Stewart. Poor Farren was a burlesque “ boy” and
step-dancer, with a neat, old-fashioned method and a
rough, husky voice. Ada Reeve is a petite musical-
comedy girl, her style coquettishiy wicked-one of the
small and spicy sort—-and her voice very fresh and
musical.

The NSW. Income-Tax Department has a
ravenous hunger after the saxpence. When The Bulletin
got a verdict with costs in the Atacama case, t
day it found itself £2200 out of pocket after all was
squared-up-in other words, £2200 of the costs were not
recoverable from the defeated party, and they represented
the price of The Bulletins victory. It didn t worry
about that ; that kind of legal mystery is all in the
day’s work. But what is not in the day s work is the de-
mand of the Income-Tax Department for income-tax (£os)
on the money lost. The Department claims that the
±;2200 was not leirally chargeable as business expenses,
and it insists on reckoning that the lost £2200 is still part
of The Bulletin’s income for ’9B. But though it refuses
to recognise that The Bulletin paid away this money to
its legal representatives, and wants this paper to pay tax
on it, the Department also recognises that the money was
received by the legal representatives, and charges them
income-tax on it. The Bulletin is amused. It has
thoughts of writing a pome on the N.S.W. Income-Tax
Department. , • •
The City Council of Sydney met a few days ago
to consider the awful financial position of things, .and to
fix the rate for the ensuing year. The situation is, that
the Council’s income hasn’t met its expenditure tor a
number of years, and it has heaped up an overdraft of
nearly £120,000, solely through lack of courage to face
the situation and levy a big enough rate to cover ex-
penses. The prospect is that, including interest
on the overdraft, it will require a rate of Is. 6d. in
the £, despite all the recent economies, instead of the
present Is. 4d., to meet next year s expenses. If it was
proposed to reduce the overdraft a little and catch up
some arrears of street repairs it would probably require a
rate of Is. Bd. in the £. Anyway, the customary Is. 4d.
in the i', it is estimated, will leave a deficit of £12,657 at
the very lowest computation. After considering which
things, the aldermen blandly made the rate Is. 4d. in the
£, and decided to let the deficiency take care of itself.
Now, it is impossible to imagine that even the
gang of imbeciles at present in municipal office
would rather have a deficit than not. Also, they
don’t look like the sort of men who would care much
whether other people pay Is. 6d. in the £—or even 2s. 6d.
or 6s. Bd. So the only possible assumption is that they are
thinking of their own share of the rates that the
present variety of Sydney aldermen would rather let the
hopeless debt pile up and take its chance than pay an
extra 2d. in the £ them selves and keep the city solvent.
Anyhow, Sydney badly wants a new set of aldermen.
The municipal finance of the second largest city on this
continent isn’t good enough to run a roast-potato can or
a coffee-barrow, unless the front wheel of that barrow is
pointing straight for the Insolvency Court.
Judging by the report of the Sydney Water and
Sewerage Board for the year ended 30th June, 1898,
things are not going well with that body, and if they
don’t improve it will shortly have to sit down and think
hard over its position. In 1891 the revenue covered
working expenses and paid £4 ss. lOd. per cent, on the
money borrowed. Since then there has been a steady
downward movement, till in 1898 the return was only £3
4s. 7d. per cent. Last year the department’s revenue was
£34,077 short of the expenditure ; the profit balance from
previous good years was completely used up, and the
department was left with a debit of about £7OOO. The
revenue was £3OOO more than in ’97, while the expenses
were £BOOO more. A good deal of the trouble is set down
to the fall in property values. In 1889 the value of pro-
perty in the western suburbs was £1,656,000, and it was
fondly anticipated that it would increase by the time the
works were completed to £3,300,000. But instead it has
fallen to £1,478,000, and the Board finds, just like its
brother-Board in Melbourne, that, even after charging
much higher rates than were intended, it is falling into
no small orifice. Still, it isn’t the beginning of a circum-
stance compared with the Melbourne orifice as yet.
Apropos of the above a condensed statement in
the newly-issued “ Abstract of Victorian Statistics” sets
forth the incredible-looking fact that in 1898 the expendi-
ture of the Melb. Metropolitan Board of Works was over
£120,000 more than its revenue. This official publication,
being apparently sober and in its sane intellect, alleges
that the fearfuily-mismanaged institution which Bard
Fitzgibboii bosses and muddles, has progressed like this
in the last six years
Revenue. Expenditure.

1897 .. 163,432 257,913
1898 .. 169,476 291,675
This expenditure has nothing to do with the construction
of new sewers and waterworks; the Board has spent
£2,678,000 of borrowed money on construction in the last
six years (and instead of the new works producing more
revenue to help cover interest, the revenue has actually
declined by £9000), but all this goes into a separate ac-
count. The £291,675 is ordinary expenditure —£25,000
for maintenance of existing works, £24,000 to the multi-
tude of large and small Fitzgibbons who look on and see
it done, and £242,000 for interest on borrowed money.
How long it will take, at this rate of mismanage-
ment, for the Melb. Metropolitan Board of Gibbon to be-
come utterly insolvent is a matter of very simple arith-
metic. The said Board is a sort of stupid and ridiculously
incompetent Legislative Council in a small way. The
people elect the multitudinous municipal councils
on a very narrow property-suffrage, and the councils
elect the Board of Works, so that dreadful
institution is far from any direct popular control.
The first essential reform is to have the Board
elected directly by the people on the one-man-one-vote
principle, somewhat after the fashion of the London
County Council. Then there will be a chance of a few
able men getting on to it. It would be worth the while
of able and ambitious men to try for seats on a body
which represented 460,000 persons when they could get
there by a direct appeal to the people. But to get there
by filtering through the municipal council of Footscray or
Collingwood isn’t quite the same thing.

Ex-Republican Dibbs, splashing wildly at the
anti-Federal meeting, asked his hearers to remember, as
one wildly irrelevant argument against Federation, “ the
state of the other colonies, and how, in the financial
troubles of 1893, those colonies had been sustained by the
gold of New South Wales ” (1893 was the year when
Dibbs’s brother’s bank and the A.J.S. suspended, for want
of gold, and the others were saved by State assistance
and a lavish issue of paper money with a forced cur-
rency). Poor old Dibbs, who is capable of pretty nearly
anything in the way of hideous blundering, here put
both his commodious feet in it even worse than' usual.
According to the banking returns (they can be found on
page 297 of the Insurance and Banking Record for

worst of the storm was over, at the end of I s ept., • ,’

percent, per annum on the shareholders funds (capital,

mani'a has, judged by its figures, the worst-paying
business among all the non-reconstructed banks of Aus-
tralasia. Also, it shows up worse than several of the
reconstructs. If its assets are quite sound, and there is
no heavy depreciation which ought to be provided for but
isn’t the position of the Commercial of Tasmania looks a
good deal of a mystery. Its business lies in a province
which escaped the worst of the 1893 slump. The profits
of the other Tasmanian bank —the National —dropped
from £5382, for the half-year ended November, ’92, to
£4516 at November, ’9B, which is a very mild fall com-
pared to the great descent of the Commercial ; and the
National, with only about half the funds and a much
smaller business, is now the larger profit-earmngmstitu-
tion of the two. Compared with the rival FV.vspecK insti-
tution, the great falling-away of the Commercial looks in-
explicable, and it is this odious comparisoh which suggests
that a writing-down of the assets might, do a lot of _good.
During the half-year, deposits have increased by fcbout
£50,000, but otherwise things remain much the samel

The Maoriland State Life Insurance Depart-
ment presents a very prosperous report for the year
ended 31st December, 1898. Figures compare with some
previous years as follows :

1898 278,948 131.200 410.148 vm ■ -e
The total funds of the Maoriland State Life insurance - e-
partment are now £2,861,534, so with anything like a good
year they should touch £3,000,000 at the end of ’99. It
is the only one of the six large Australasian life offices
whose interest earnings and total income have increased
every year during the last eight years—in fact, most of
the others have shown a tendency to decrease so far as
premium income is concerned. It is the second largest
office in Australasia, and by far the largest among the
institutions of its age. It. has the lowest expense-rate
among the mutual life offices of Australasia, the A. M.P.
only excepted. It charges lower premiums than any other
Australasian office ; it pays good bonuses ; and it is the
only office with State security, at the back of its policies,
and a State audit as a guarantee of the soundness of its
assets. And it has produced these results by working in
one small province only, whereas most of its competitors
gather in business from seven or more.
In 1897 the expenses of the Maoriland State
Life Department were £l4 17s. 2d. per cent, of the total
income. In 1898 they had dropped to £l4 7s. The
interest earnings were £4 13s. lid. per cent., and as the
Department at its last investigation made sufficient
reserves to reduce its estimates of future interest to £3los.
per cent., there is a very large margin of safety. The
assets look remarkably good—about £1,000,000 of them
consist of State and municipal securities and £541,000 are
loans on the Department’s own policies. Such dubious
items as foreclosed properties and arrears of interest are
much lower than the average. Altogether, the only State
Life Insurance office on earth is a remarkably prosperous
institution, and the pity is that Australia is not blessed
with an establishment of the same description under
equally good management.

The Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corpora-

The accounts of the Ocean Co. for 1898 might be read as
showing a profit of £213,547, or a loss of £41,814, or any-
thing between the two. This is the first year when the
Ocean Co. has shown separately the profit balance and the

The exact difference between £? and £69,515 being an

premiums increased from £334,000 in 1897 to £718,000 in
1898, Vhich is an enormous jump. The reserve fund,
largely through the issue of new shares at a premium, has
gone up from £lOO,OOO in 1896 to £250,000 in 1898, and
the entire reserves are about £669,000. Also the actual
outgoings for the year are £213,547 less than the receipts,
so the shareholders are doing well enough ; and the 15
per cent, dividend is very regular.

Melbourne Mutual Store didn’t have nearly so
gaudy a row as usual at its late meeting, when the
balance-sheet for the half-year to 31st January, ’99, was
presented. The news that £2OOO worth of groceries had
taken wings and fled out of the stock, and that no one
could even guess how or where they had gone, paralysed
the meeting. The Mutual Store, which seems to be
always in rows and deep water, has progressed something
like this of late years :

It is supposed that it was about July, 98, that the
groceries absconded, so the £2OOO is deducted there—
otherwise, that half-year’s profits would be £3221. The
poor old Store’s trouble is the same trouble which all the
great Melbourne institutions fell into during the boom.
Instead of renting a humble establishment, it built a vast
stone palace at a cost of £llO,OOO. Its capital is only
£112,600, and when the bricks and mortar swallowed this
practically all up it had to borrow capital for trading pur-
poses. So it has £64,404 overdraft at the Bank of Vic-
toria, and the heavy interest eats up the profits, and
things never get any further forward, and everybody is
soured and hopeless. And it is difficult to see what can
be done except peg away mournfully at reducing the
huge 0.d., and moor the groceries with a kedge anchor to
prevent any further elopements.

Gold-dredging, both by bucket-dredges and
pump-dredges, with complete methods attached for gold-
saving, is an industry that has come to stay in Australia.
Maoriland owes much of her present prosperity in the
South Island to recent developments in this branch of
mining. In Vic. excellent results are being obtained, and
investment in gold-dredging co’s is popular. N.S. Wales
possesses areas eminently suitable for successful gold-
dredging, and the famous Araluen Valley is considered
one of the most likely to return good results. What is
claimed to be the pick of the whole valley has lately been
taken up by the Gold-dredging Options Syndicate, with a
view to active work at an early date. From the portions
of this ground already worked, scores of thousands of
ounces have been taken out by diggers in the past, but
many thousands must yet remain in the sand and bed of
the creek, and extremely rich results are looked for.
Araluen Creek is now pegged out for miles, and little
ground above or below the old workings is available.
Those apparently most alive to the possibilities of dredg-
ing for gold both here and on Shoalhaven river are the
Maorilanders, of whom there are several parties.*

Some 12 years back Bright District Association,
Vic., started a tunnel into the Oriental Hill, Wandiligong,
to look for a lode worked 900 ft. above for £780,000 in
gold. Tunnel now in 3000 ft., several hundred more to go,
and owners think the time has arrived for Govt, to lend a
hand. Mines Minister agreeable, but co. has nothing to
offer as security for money lent as required by the Act.
A little Bill to remove the embargo is suggested. The
law wisely prevents any co. registered outside Victoria
participating ; still one English co. had the gall to ask for
Victorian State assistance. It was advised to apply to
Premier Salisbury for aid from the British prospecting
vote.

British B.H. improves ; a fine body of sulphides
has been exposed in a little-worked section at the Block
14 end. And the carbonate ores, for which there was
never before so good a market, hold out exceedingly well.
The British has had a phenomenal run of hard luck, but
it seems that some sort of a change is working up. The
co. has just made a big sale of concentrates. Block 10,
too,, looks better than usual at present. And the Central
(Sulphide Corporation) has made its first sale of “ zincs,”
25,000 tons of them, delivery to begin at once.
• * * *
B.H. Junction North, it is officially announced,
has mined—and sold—a small quantity of the North Co.’s
ore through mistaking the boundary—a thing not at all
hard to manage where the lode twists and turns as it does
here. The “small quantity” runs into two or three
thousand tons ; and as it is fairly good stuff the im-
poverished Junction North will have to grind a lot of the
poor stuff that alone is left to it in order to pay up. But
that is not the worst of it from shareholders’ point of
view; for if they have worked a greater length of lode
than they have a right to, it follows that their elaborate
calculations of ore available are all wrong, too. Desperate
economies are being made at the mine, one of which—the
letting of the trucking by contract —has caused a little
labor trouble—not a strike ; that word has been blacked
out of the dictionaries at Broken Hill. And as the posi-
tion is worse for the Junction North, it is, of course, just
so much better for the North than it was supposed. Cer-
tainly the latter low-grade proposition can stand con-
siderable improvement.

Gobar notes : Occidental has finished enlarging
its tank, and is still awaiting rain to clear off its bank
overdraft. Cobar Gold-Mines showing a little more
energy. Nearly a year since the co. reconstructed, and
over eight months since the cyanide plant, taken over by
the Gold Recovery Co., was shut down. The old plant
with the Huntington mill adjoining it could have been
made to earn enough money to pay wages and salaries in
Australia all this while, but the management shut right
down and locked the place up. The Chesney people
declare that the new machinery is on the way at last.
The Great Western talks seriously of erecting a cyanide
plant. The idea would be good had it a fair heap of tail-
ings to work on and were the mine opened up so that the
mill, even small as it is, could work continuously and with
profit. As matters stand, there are only about 1500 tons
of tailings, and these so coppery that they cannot be
cyanided to much profit. Hardly any real mining has
been done. Mt. Allen cyanide works have had their
first clean-up and sent in first bar of bullion. Tailings-heap
said to be small.

The Bulletin comes across an old balance-
sheet of the disgraceful Shellback mine—described as
being “for the period” (length of period not stated)
“ ending 30th June,” 1898. Its main features are that the
co. spent £2260 during the “period,” of which sum £617
was spent on the Shellback mine, £1250 went in “com-
mission, brokerage, &c.,” to the people who made money
out of the business in Sydney, and £393 was spent in
various ways in or about the Sydney office. The blessed
Shellback lasted about a year altogether, and now
another mine, which looks just like it—the Gulgong Gold-
mining Co.—is being built out of the ruins. A large
moral comes in just here. When a mine is started with
a very small capital, as the Shellback was, and as the
Gulgong Gold-mining Co. is, it is absurd to expect that
any real mining can be effected. There is no money to
do it with, and nobody who understands the business
expects that any real mining will be done. But the fact
that the share liability is very small induces a lot of
people to go in on the ground that they don’t risk much.
Enough money is collected among them to let the people
who mine in dingy offices in Sydney get their £1250, or
whatever it is, and then the show probably closes up for
want of any more cash to pay wages. So far as the
people who start such a co. are concerned, it matters
nothing or very little if it does close up—after they have
got their money. The next thing to do is to float a new
co. and make another little commission.
Apropos of a par. in last week’s Bulletin, re
the Gulgong Gold-Mining Co., which is being formed on
a hopelessly small capital to play at working a part of the
dead-and-gone Shellback Co.’s ground, and, incidentally,
to find salaries and commissions for a few people : this co.
is not identical with, or in any way connected with, the
Gulgong Gold Mines Syndicate (promoted by William
Thompson, of Gulgong), and any obloquy which fell on
the latter through the smellful memories of the Shellback
affair was quite undeserved.

The old - established Wallaroo and Moonta
Copper Co. (S. A.) made last year a profit of £28,554. Of
this, £8000 has been paid in divs., £5000 goes to the de-
benture sinking-fund, and the balance goes forward and
to the liquidation of heavy liabilities incurred to extend
the custom-plant. The directors will not wholly adopt
the general practice of charging the co. with depreciation
of plant only, and not with any of the prime cost; they
will use the extra money coming in from the higher value
of copper to wipe the liability for the plant right out.
Despite the higher price ruling for copper, the
Wallaroo and Moonta co. has had to curtail the pro-
duction from the Moonta. The mine has been worked
continuously since 1860, but the payable ore is now con-
fined to comparatively narrow limits ; last year the total
extraction was 14,600 tons ore, which gave 2491 tons
metal, as against 15,688 tons ore, yielding 2937 tons metal
in ’97. Wallaroo’s figures were 22,792 tons ore for 2615
tons copper in ’98, as against 17,102 tons ore for 2136 tons
copper in ’97. Moonta’s percentage is still the better, of
course ; but, then, Wallaroo was completely dwarfed only
a few years ago. At the two mines together the mining
cost was £35 18s. lid. per ton of metal, smelting cost £12
3s. 7d., and shipping and other charges *1 12s. 3d. The
co., by the way, has promised its miserably-paid hands a
“ rise ” in June ; but, seeing that it is getting the benefit
of the improved copper market all the time, the tardy
concession has caused more dissatisfaction than other-
wise.

Mephan Ferguson, engineer, etc., has just com-

the largest planing machines every made in any part of
the world. It weighs about 100 tons, and is the machine
to be used in planing and thickening up the edges of
28ft. x Jin. plates required in manufacturing the patent
Lockingbar pipes for Coolgardie water supply contract. All
the steel bars for this contract will be supplied from the
Earl of Dudley works, Eng., but in order to get prompt
delivery the order for the steel plates has been divided
amongst four German firms. The first shipment of 500
tons will be dispatched by the Maori King, now loading.*

The few who stick to their shows in the rich
country between Coolgardie and the Murchison continue
to beat out some big yields ; but camel-cartage takes all
the cream in one mouthful. The last monthly Lawlers-

The erection of the sulphide plant at the Aus-

day, and the whole of the product will subsequently be
fed into four Ropp roasting furnaces. The rolls are slow

running of the Great Boulder mine to have to adopt a

process was going to take more gold than the tailings con-

that, in six months, the Govt, would be losing so much
of money on all its batteries that he would be able to

It is not often that an incautious citizen
finds his wrong way into the N.S.W. Leg. Coun-
cil chamber. When he does, he hurries with all
speed out of that abode of solemnity, grey hairs,
bald-heads, spectacles, disjointed remarks, totter-
ing intellect, gout, prejudice, confused ideas,
weird toryism, abdominal immensity, and frock-
coat. Once or twice in a decade, however, the
Assembly sends along a Bill that rouses the
sleepy Council to activity. No hurricane-struck
seaport was ever more agitated than the Council
when the Federal Enabling Bill was fired into it
by the people’s Assembly. An excited Council is
a fine pantomime. Nearly every member rises at
once to catch the President’s eye. They are
laboring under suppressed speech and awful in-
dignation, and hands chop the air like a dis-
ordered calisthenic class in motion. Then they
all sit down but one, and he mumbles a protest in
half-articulate speech ; and consults a slip of paper,
and drops his spectacles on it, forty times in ten
minutes, and each time he is half a minute adjust-
ing the spectacles and fifteen seconds finding the
place on the paper. A forty-minutes’ speech
means thirty-minutes’ grabbing after lost spec-
tacles and ten minutes’ half-articulate mumble and
buzz. This is the House which prides itself on
being a check upon hasty legislation and the
saviour of the country.

A par about Governor Beauchamp in a

to the Sydney girls who have laid in a stock of

as to Beauchamp’s utter respectability and prig-
gishness comes rolling in by every mail, and he
begins to look very like a part of a British

The Sydney evening papers, The Bulle-

the aggressions of the morning press having forced
them to nose round for new fields. For many
years past you could read Sydney’s evening prints
any afternoon without being one whit the wiser
about, what had been done on the Exchange in the

their misconduct, declared he had received no pay-
ment, and expected none. The Judge then re-
marked that the witness’s conduct was inconceiv-

a proposition to

tertained ; a diffi-
culty in the way,
however, being:
that the nurse,
though certified

local medical
officer, was not
fully qualified as
required by the
regulations. The
Govt, medical
officer was com-
municated with on
the subject, and

applications were

when the commit-
tee metto consider
them it was re-
solved (despite a
communication
from the G.M.O.
to effect that the
nurse couldn’t be

the applications
be not opened, and that the appointment he con-
ferred upon the nurse. Next, a telegram was
sent the G.M.O. notifying him of the appointment
and asking for his approval. The answer to this
was, of course, another refusal, and now this not-

In British law a jury, in a criminal case,
is not supposed to know of an accused’s previous
convictions, assuming hfm to have any. In Vic-

is subverted by an
ingenious little

o f the Crown

Several times

drawn attention

to see whether

ing the presentment. If there are
more sheets than one, and of a dif-
ferent color, the “ fly ” jurors know
just as well as if the associate had

Certain landlords of Cameron-street, Pad-
dington, Sydney, where a shooting tragedy
lately took place, have had a petition
drawn up, praying that the
name of the street may be
altered, in consequence of
“the detrimental effect that
the recent tragedy was hav-
ing upon properties situated
therein.” They also plain-
tively proclaim that “it is dim-
cult, and at times utterly impos-
sible, to induce tenants to inspect
vacant properties in the ill-fated
street.” Which recalls the cele-
brated deputation to Lord
Palmerston from Rugeley, the
scene of the well-advertised
Palmer poisonings, asking
that the name of tbe village
might be changed. “ Yes,’
replied “Pam.” “call it>

not so foolish as it looks, for it is an un-

VICTORIA’S SYMPATHY.
“ Overtaking the funeral of a peasant whilst
out driving along a narrow road, near Cimiez,
Queen Victoria gave orders for her carriage to
follow the cortege at a walking pace. Rather
than disturb the mourners, the Queen followed
the funeral for a quarter of an hour.’ Item pub-
lished by all the dailies in the great Australian
cable-ring.
The proprietress of a “home” for Yic.
female inebriates, giving evidence before the
Habitual Drunks’ Board, stated that
“ idleness, both mental and phy-
sical, is very marked in all
dipsomaniacs.” A man may
combine the liquor habit
with the habit of hard
work in art, science,
literature, and legal
or commercial prac-
tice. An active
genius for figures
is quite compat-
ible with an old-
established in-
sobriety, as in
the case of a
late notable

tant. But the
female slave
to alcohol

solid interest

A M.L. self-stayer left this behind him, in
a letter to his parents :
The jury may find I committed suicide whilst in low
spirits through being out of work, which is the real cause
as I am as sane as any man.
The jury verdicted as requested. There you have
clearly illustrated the difference between legal
insanity and medical insanity. The man delibe-
rately killed himself, but the impulse was irre-
sistible, all the same.

The recent Sydney libel-action (in which
an ex-M.L.A. of N.S.W. obtained =£2so damages
against the Australian Star) suggests to The
Bulletin that in some respects sweet are the uses
of the libel. Though, doubtless, nobody who
knows plaintiff would ever have suspected rum of
getting vulgarly drunk and having unlawful silver
spoons in his pocket, it is now, by his. own sworn
testimony, and by defendant s admissions, pro-
claimed abroad unto all men that he has never

In recently sentencing a man

“Micky Moubra”: How about
“ Yowi ” as a name for the Federal
capital ? It’s short, and is aboriginese
for “yes.” Meaning “yes,” it would
remind provincialists of the great ma-

those very tired Cornstalksthat N.S.
Wales’s majority of “Yes’s’’was 5000
odd on that day, and thereby counter-
act the baleful influence of the same
old lie of Sydney D.T. which tries to
convince them N.S.W. gave a negative
majority vote.
The second Gatton murder inquiry has at
least forced the Law to recognise one thing—that
the local inhabitants in general don t take the
investigation kindly. The attitude of the ad-
jacent population is that it wishes the whole affair
dropped—that it resents inquiry as a personal
injury, and that it wants rather to block investi-
gation than to help it. In fact, it wears the sulky
aspect of a community which knows the criminal
and is tacitly leagued together to shield hitn;
either because it approves of his action for reasons
of its own, or because his discovery would lead
also to the discovery of the state of things which
led up to the crime, and the community, again for
reasons of its own, doesn’t want that matter
stirred up with the long pole of official inquisitive-
ness. The apathy of the Murphy family, its utter
lack of interest in the search for the murderer, the
difficulty of dragging evidence out of witnesses,
the fact that the evidence dragged out at the
second inquiry seems to show that some important
facts were suppressed at the original inquest, the
promptitude and enthusiasm with which the local
crowd trod out all the tracks which might have
revealed the criminal, and various other things,
including the strong curse language thrown at the
investigating magistrate, have convinced that
functionary that the district regards anyone who
shakes up its tragedy as an enemy.
So long as there seemed a chance of hanging an
outsider for the crime, and thereby shifting the
responsibility off the district, said district rolled
up manfully and identified Burgess (who, it now
appears, wasn’t there at all) with beautiful
unanimity. But when the prospect of hanging
the wrong man began to fade away the Murphy
country grew resentful and grumpy, lhe Bris-
bane officials felt themselves in much the same
situation as the British officials do in India, lhe
trouble there is that the white man, living right
alongside the brown man all_ his life, can never
find out what the brown man is thinking of, and
the brown man never tells him. And the city
officials look silently at the clannish turnip-
growers around Gatton, who are mostly brothers
and cousins and half-cousins, and wonder to no
purpose what they are thinking of. I hey
have a vague suspicion that these turnip-
growers know, by a sort of freemasonry, who
did the crime, and what led up to it; and that in
their own silent agricultural way they agree among
themselves, without saying anything, either that
the crime was justifiable, or that it was quite
natural considering the circumstances—whatever
they might be ; or else that the circumstances
were such that it is the less evil of the two to say
nothing about it. And it looks as if the most
promising thing the law could do would be to buy
a farm near Gatton, and let a detective grow tur-
nips there for 20 years till he begins to understand
the local ways of thinking, and then let that tec
report to the department.
It was characteristic of the Gatton tragedy
scandal that magistrate Shand thought himself
called upon to offer a demi-semi-apology for having
hurt anybody’s feelings. “ I have actually been
accused personally of crushing the Murphy family
because the members were called as witnesses.
Such a charge is beyond my comprehension, and
reflects no credit on my accusers, said Shand.
And this after hearing the evidence of an outside
Murphy to the effect that a member of the Murphy
family had taken it for granted that the murder
was a purely family affair ! How many influences
have been at work to prevent the arrest of several
of the clan on suspicion ?

it. The tragedy was a Boxing Jiight one. The land
the Murphys came from provides such tragedies in
plenty at such a time. The three persons who had
stuck together during the night were those
slaughtered. One life may have fallen by acci-
dent in fight, and the others of the party were
killed to buy silence. Analogues to this view are
numerous. This view rejects the outraging busi-
ness altogether. When the fight was over, the
guilty parties placed the bodies in the cart on a
blanket, drove to the paddock, laid them out,
making pretence that the girls were outraged,
shot the horse, and burnt the blanket. The doc-
tor’s evidence of outrage is vitiated by his evidence
on other points. Put outrage aside, and the whole
case is typically Irish. The bobby losing his
notes, the apathy or reticence of the Murphy
family, the hunt for “strangers” and clinging
with death grip to scapegoat Burgess are all re-
lated incidents. Begin by saying the girls were
not outraged, and most of the mystery is dis-
solved.

“Zoo”: The best “theory” to date

evening, a scattered-looking man, who owned to
having been rabbiting for the last six months
where “ they didn’t see no noospapers,” was re-
ceiving a very muddled account of the. Gatton
mystery from a friend. When the two girls were
mentioned his weather-wrinkled face took on a
fine expression of scorn. “Then,” said he, “I
don’t believe there was no murder, nor no hout-
rage, nor nothin’ at all. Yer never can believe
anythin where girls is mixed up, they’re sich
blanky liars ! G’arn, I know ! They’ll pretend

Coolgardie Exhibition “ opened with
great iclat” —-promises to be the biggest frost
in the whole history of Joubert’s raree shows. So
small a fraction of the alleged exhibits have
arrived that the interior of the building was, at
latest mail-dates, a scene of desolation. The
Forrest Govt, was persuaded into giving .£lO,OOO,
much of which has gone to provide the venerable
showman and a host of officials with billets and
travelling exes. The few exhibitors who have
sent goods to the city of truth and thirst are
raising such a howl about their treatment that
Forrest has promised to appoint a commission to
look into things. Profound apathy is exhibited
respecting the show, as may be guessed by the fact
that the public subscriptions of Geraldton (the
second port of Westralia) to secure a <£2s bay for
the district, only amounted to .£4 10s. 4d. ! It
was amusing to read of the elaborate preparations
made for the opening ceremony—vice-regal pro-
cession, bands, fire brigades, old pioneers, Odd-
fellows, school-children, blackfellows, Afghans;
cantata, fanfare of trumpets and fireworks. Ac-
cording to Joubert, Paris Exhibition was simply
“ not to be in it.”
Half the Coolgardie hotelkeepers hope to make
enough out of the exhibition to clear out, and so
dodge the official-receiver, who is at present even
a bigger man in W.A. than Premier Forrest.
Shilling drinks and ss. meals, with shakedowns
ditto, are among the attractions held out to
visitors.
Now, you of the loyal Austral rout,
Drop a casual tear, if you can—
These queenly ways that we read about
Make better the heart of a man
(And we thank the chap who cabled ’em out
Sheer under the ocean’s span).
She met the corpse on a narrow path,
With its mournful following—
She might have loosened her regal wrath,
But the Queen did no such thing ;
Such wondrous patience Victoria hath
We cannot help marvelling.
"Twas only the corpse of a peasant thrall,
And his grieving womankind ;
But the Queen, she honored the humble pall
With a sympathy refined
(She couldn’t drive over the funeral
So her Majesty lagged behind).

fetching frock was a bright blue yachting costume
smartly cut, and elaborated with lots of gold
braid and buttons. This was worn with a white
peaked cap and a happy expression that showed

Some people laughed at the ballet when the cur-
tain stuck at the dancers’ knees. It gave a too-
k° I n’w 16W i and fat legs in repose. The
ballet frocks were fairy, effective affairs of colored
tuiie, with satin strips falling loosely from the
waist all round. In a ballet the importance of
looking earnest is all knocked on the head. To
smile.; to look as if you’re doing nothing in the
world but smile; to create the impression of
avmg no brains, no body, no responsibilities,
nothing more tangible than a smile that mustn’t
mean anything; these go a long way with a
danseuse. When the “ Round the World ” ballet
gets rid of its careworn look it ought to be very
allurmg as the setting is a dream and the frocks
are fetchmgly flowery.
The prophecy in this column that there would
be a rush of female students to the University at
the next academic year has been verified by the
last matriculation results. Numbers of the aspir-

been much abashed at the decree of those in
authority that their flowing locks or pigtails must
be securely braided to their heads. They are even
compelled to go home with their hair done up.
Rather strange that Prof. MacCallum’s Sydney

divorcee ha,s lately been taken on as cook by the
J udge who tried her case. A kind friend told the
ex-husband how beautifully the new cook was
turning out the Judge’s dinners. ‘‘ She gives him
the most wonderfuUy-cooked vegetables,” con-
ciuded the friend. The ex-husband smiled a
satisfied smile. “She’ll soon give him onlv

Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
~ 1 11 private life, General Booth seems to out-
siders as pompous and puffed-up a martinet as the
most stiff-necked old-style 4 officer and gentleman’
on Her Majesty s half-pay list. Said latter-day
apostle, tis said, takes much thought for what
he eats, issuing his culinary commands, even in
private houses, brusquely enough for Napoleon
ordering his new nobles to divorce their canaille
spouses, preparatory to marrying princesses. The
Salvation Army commander-in-chief is waited
upon hand-and-foot by a devoted aide, who tends
him cleverly as a valet. Likely as not this attache
is a trained valet, though he fights the devil be-
tween times in the uniform of a ‘colonel,’ or sich.
lor that matter, General Booth’s Australian
grand-children are washed and combed by a she-
adjutant. Under her warlike guidance, their
daily walks abroad are thrilling as blood-and-fire
marches, while the very kitten sports its hallelujah
bonnet, praise the Lord !
“Mrs. Steve Fairbairn, recently presented at
Gourt as chronicled in the Argus, is a fair, dainty
pocket-beauty, by birth a Bananalander the
motherless only daughter of that old Central
Queensland identity, the late Sydney Sharwood.
Mrs. kairbairn married at seventeen. She has
two small sons, who, like all the ‘handsome Fair-
bairns; will probably be athletes in their day.

Mack Sharwood, was champion long-jumper of

the latter are of the crape variety or culled from

Paula she wasn t quite the sort of woman to asso-
ciate with young person Ellean. He wept at har-
rowing moments, echoed Carne’s conjugal kisses
with his own elderly lips, and very often uttered
m approving accents. I think he
meant Mrs. Tanqueray’s yellow satin bodice. It
was a shade decollete, don’tcherknow. One
doesn t wonder that ‘ Saint Ellean, ’ fresh from her
convent, rather shrank from pressure to such a
trank corsage m the presence of strange men.
“Mrs. Brough’s new costumes for Paula Tan-
queray make that woman a glorious being. In
the first act, a silk frock, golden as the rising sun
m colour, and fitting as though the actress had
been jioured into it. How many figures are there
which could stand the revealing of splendid lines
and curves that such a dress makes ? It was made
plain, low ill the neck, and drew a sweeping train
alter it. Ihe gomg-out dress was a violet cloth
wffh over-skirt of same color and stuff prettily
braided. Paula palpitated her last before pour-
ing poison into her lovely self, in a dress that was
even lower in the neck, though not more figure-
reveahng than that in the first act. Indeed it
seemed that Mrs. Brough had chosen to do the
gasping business in a dress so built, in order to
exhibit the powerful breast action of the emotional
scenes.
Of late there have been some impressive per-
formances of eating' on Melb. stage. When Brough
gave a matinee of ‘ One Summer’s Day ’ at the
irnncess t other Wednesday, the co. had evidently
reserved a portion of its mid-day appetite for the

alter the manner of stage picnickers in general.
J.ney sent along their plates for whatever was
going, and ate enthusiastically. Unfortunately
they were pressed for time and had to conform to
the rules of polite society, but they got through a
iot ot square meal nevertheless.
“The shooting-party’s luncheon in ‘The White
-tleather is not such a scene of devouring interest
as the matinee feed aforesaid, although it has its
realistic moments. None of the adults seem
hungry in comparison with the youngster (little
Ida ingersoll), who swoops down upon the sausage-
roils after her elders have gone away to shoot.
.Liittle Ida s amazing appetite scores again in the
second act, where she is served with scones and
milk, or something of that sort, at a table in
Battersea Park. Miss Watson, as the unhappy
mother of the hungry one, can hardly keep a sad
face whilst her alleged offspring is sowing the

PEOPLE YOU KNOW.
No. 2.—The Postman.
A rural postman writes : “ I desire to add this
unsolicited testimony to the sterling qualities of
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa. I am a rural postman,
and exposed to all kinds of weather. I have used
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa daily this last eleven
months, and I believe that I can do my work with
less fatigue since I have used it. I can honestly
recommend to my fellow postmen Dr. Tibbies’
Vi-Cocoa for its sustaining qualities.”
Of late years many new manufactures, rejoicing
in a multiplicity of names, have been brought
before the public notice, but there are none which
have bounded into favor so readily as has Dr.
Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa. Throughout the country its
sales have increased with great rapidity, and an
article which only a few years back was unheard
of has now become one of the most popular
beverages of the people.
Merit, and merit alone, is what is claimed for
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa, and the Proprietors are
prepared to send to any reader who names The
Bulletin (a post-card will do) a dainty sample tin
of Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa free and post paid.
There is no magic in all this. It is a plain,
honest, straightforward offer. It is done to intro-
duce the merits of Vi-Cocoa into every home
Dr. Tibbies' Vi-Cocoa, as a concentrated form of
nourishment and vitality, is invaluable : nay,
more than this, for to ail who wish to face the
strife and battle of life with greater endurance and
more sustained exertion, it is absolutely indispens-
able.
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa can be obtained from all
chemists, grocers, and stores, or from Dr. Tibbies’
Vi-Cocoa, Limited, 269 G-eorge-street, Sydney.*

Among the varied phenomena of Australia, the

an illimitable supply of sparkling mineral water, now-
sold everywhere as Zetz-Spa water. The enormous in-
crease in the demand testifies in a striking manner to the
popularity and good effects of Zetz-Spa water, which is
rightly called “ The Premier Natural Mineral Table

Perhaps the smartest new man sent to Q.

Mr. P. R. Larkin, J.P., who has
joined the directorate of Sydney Con-
secrated Press, has been interviewed
by that paper on his recent visit to the
M.L. hot-spring region, where, he
learnedly says, he was much “struck
by the extensive pumice plains, inter-
sected in various directions by high
ranges of igneous formation, relieved
here and there by enormous trachytic
cones.” “ All the springs,” he is made
to say, “ have not been analysed yet,
but there are saline, alkaline, alkaline-
silicious, hepatic, sulphurous, acidic,
besides saline waters containing iodine,
cold acidulous chalybeates, and saline
acidulous chalybeates.” “Hepatic”
springs is probably a misprint for
“Hepatrick.” After remarking that
you can bathe or enjoy the delightful
views “ad arbitrium,” he proceeds to
descant on the action of the baths, the
salts of which, he points out, are not
absorbed into the system. “ The body,”
remarks Patrick, “cannot absorb any
salts from an aqueous solution. If the
water, or any portion of it, is allowed
to dry on the skin, a minute quantity
of the constituent solids of course re-
mains, which, through the friction of
the clothing, become incorporated with
the fatty elements of the integument,
and is eventually absorbed.” ....

the most important emunctory of the

A house once inhabited by Adam
Lindsay Gordon, with the garden which
surrounded it, is opposite Glenelg
(S.A.) State-school, and, as the pro-
perty has been long unoccupied, is
rapidly falling to bits. Gordon was in
S.A. Assembly from March, '65, to
Nov., ’66, and that was the period
during which he lived in the cottage,
referred to. He only made one ambi-
tious speech in Parliament, although
he spoke on two other occasions. He
was absent from most divisions, and it
is notable that during the passage of
a Licensed Victuallers Bill through
Committee his vote was every time
cast on the side of Bung. Once, when
there was a “call of the House ” on
some constitutional question, “ the
only member absent without excuse
was Adam Lindsay Gordon, member
for Victoria.” He began very well,
and in Hansard reports during the
first part of his political career his
name figures often as presenting peti-
tions on behalf of his district, or taking
part in divisions.

towards St. Mary’s Cathedral and Riverview Col-

Those Federal conventions will yet be the

John Forrest has been laid up with strained

Capt. Oats, M.L.A. for Yilgarn (W.A.), is

Superintendent Read and Inspector-
General Fosbery are both entitled to retire on

Some Nemesis. The two men who cut

the same locality. Dick, who was Governor of
Mudgee Gaol when they were hanged, occupied
the condemned cell later on for having, in a fit of
jealousy, shot dead one of his subordinates. He
was reprieved.
W. G. Higgs, who within a month has

popularity in Mongrelia. A year ago Higgs and
his “ Socialism in our time ” motto were uni-

owners in the City Council and all sorts in
Parliament. Those in the know attribute much
of this sudden success to the fact that Higgs
recently found faith, and blossomed into a solemn
and energetic deacon of the kirk —the kirk, by the
way, being the one with the largest congregation
in his electorate. Anyhow, Higgs is well-meaning,
well-versed in economic subjects, and will quite
hold his own in Leperland Assembly.

brother to an earl, author, poet, lecturer, and several
other things, is apparently having a good time in Tas-
mania. Being a “ 8.A.,” he naturally takes the schools
under his special protection, and condescendingly gives
good ad vice to the rising generation. He appears specially
susceptible to “dear hearts,” and has expressed admira-
tion for the samples he has met with in Tasmania. The
funniest thing about Bainbridge, not even overlooking
his flowing locks and Buffalo Bill make-up, is his relation
of certain incidents in his lecture to slow music. “Tor-

Murderer Briggs, to be hanged next Wednes-
day at Sydney, when employed at a city ware-
house used to sit down at luncheon-time with
other men and boys in the place, and tell them all
how dearly he loved the girl whom he eventually
slew. Also, this is the letter which he wrote about
the murder (though he had been for four years at
an excellent private school and four years at
Newington College):—
“Carlton Crescent, Summer Hill,
“ December 13, iB9B.
“ This is to state that the girl that has come to grief by
me is one who professed to love me, but is sincerely false.
One time she did act as if true love did exist between us,
but now the tables are turned, and all along she said she
thought I was not in earnest in regards to marriage. And
I must state that I would have married the one I loved,
and that is she. But finding she is acting falsely, I did
the deed, through her own misloving ways, which always
made me think that her love, of which very little she
showed towards me, was false, and only served to act, as
if marriage between her and me would act as a mainstay,
in other words, having me on a string. And no doubt
this will come within hearing of the public, and be of a
very substantial lesson to those who are supposed to be
had or taken in. The nowadays are to be watched,
and I can assure you that this one that I am keeping
company with has pretended to be loving and true, but I
have found out that she is not so. Her sister Minnie was
heard one night to say by me, while the one I love and
who has taken me in said that ‘ if I had a wooden man,
would you not have him on a string?’ But for ail that
my strong and true love to Maggie showed that I
loved her. She could not say otherwise. That
has preyed on my mind, and other words, can say
she thought of £3 a week, which always made me thmk
that true love could not exist on her part as on mine. I
have.thought differently, and this responds to whether
she kept my company for the £3 or true love. My idea is
the £3, and it is very hard for a man to keep company
with a girl for over a year. Just think ! She has often,
in fact, time after time, shown her false love towards a
man who has never thought or breathed of anyone else,

for her, which makes me commit this outrageous deed.
It is to be hoped that her sister will not fall into a true
lover’s hands. I think the public can see why this sad
occurrence has been committed, and it may be men-
tioned that it is one of being true and loving on a man’s
part, and not on a woman’s. So may God have mercy on
each of our souls, Amen.—Yours faithfully (signed)

“ Nell Cook ”: Within the last three
months the emus of the N.S.W. side have taken
it into their heads to migrate northwards, but are
baulked by the rabbit-proof fence between N.S.W.
and Q. They have come from out-back in droves,
arid keep patrolling along the fence looking for an
opening. There was feed out-back, so hunger is
not accountable for this conduct. So weak have
they become (they do not seem to think of eating)
that they oan easily be caught by a man on foot.
When the gate of the fence is opened they make a
frantic rush, seeming to have lost all their natural
fear of man in their intense desire to get through.
The blacks say they have never known such a
thing to happen before.

“ W. A. Skinner ” to The Bulletin from
Ulverstone, Tas.
Mr. M‘Gooey (8., 11/3/’99) says, re albinism in Austra-
lia: —“I have heard of albino snakes, but can anyone
produce them ? ” Mr. Turnbull, of Ulverstone, yesterday
caught a snake about 6in. long with perfectly white back,
pink eyes and belly. It is now (preserved in spirits) in
the possession of Dr. M'Oal], of Ulverstone (Tas.). We
examined the mouth microscopically, but could see no
fangs. Mr. Turnbull’s daughters say they have often
seen a 2ft. white snake near where the little one was cap-
tured. Should this larger one be caught, I will let you
know.
(The Bulletin is now waiting to hear from some-
one who has got an albino tank or gum-tree.)

Trooper Dash, a champion thief-catcher of
out-back cattle-lifting days, once came upon two
notorious cattle-stealers driving a small mob of
unbranded calves off a Murrumbidgee run. He
secured only one of them at the time, the other
escaping into the scrub. Being nearly 20 miles

thief, Dash rushed his prisoner a couple of miles
to a wayside blacksmith’s shop,, where, finding
nothing in the shape of rope about the premises,
he shoved the cattle-stealer’s handsinto the black-
smith’s vyce, and screwed it up so as to hold the
uyin without crushing the hands. Then he went
after and captured thief No. 2 inside two hours,

“Q.” : Am never surprised to read of
people being poisoned by tinned fish, &c., bought
at tin-pot shops in bush towns. Was once on
tramp at Dalby, and went into small shop en route
to get bread. Woman asked if I’d “ take a tin of
salmon—it was only Is. 9d.” Didn’t care for it.
Then she remarked, with a sigh, that “ There was
no sale for fish, and her own lot didn’t use it.
You see them tins,” said she, pointing to two in
the window with the sun on ’em, “them two
are the last of a dozen I got when I started busi-
ness 18 years ago. They’ve stood there since ! ”
The Anglican and R.C. churches were
built upon adjoining allotments, and a substantial
paling fence divided them. “Old Bill,” the C.E.
the shade, when most wanted, fell into the other
yard, and the faithful used to hitch their nags to
the fence and take advantage of it. “ Bill ” used
to be very wild, and one day writer came upon
the old fellow chopping the trees out, and asked
“what was up.” William explained I didn’t
grow these ere trees for the benefit of a lot of
Roman Catholic horses. Not me, mister. I come

For the instruction of “6 x 8,” who appears still
rather young, “ the cobbler ” is old-English slang
f° r “ the last,” and, in shearing parlance, evidently
refers to the last sheep in the pen. And, if not,
what does it refer to? Before “6xB” was no
s j ze at aP > and the British squire began to bring
live mutton out to Australia, the latter’s shed was
nofc muck larger than a henroost. About five
shearers used to draw from one pen, “6xB’s”
dimensions, and the most frantic rush of the day
ensued at knock-off time. The real “cobbler”
was ke Pt i n the pen, perhaps all day, as the
yarder-up used him as a decoy-sheep. Conse-
ffuently, theman to get through the last of the
five sheep (bar one) first, got the “ cobbler.” Any
shearer will coincide. However good, bad, or

“C.C.M.”: Be workers and wasters. It
is often the “good” bush man who brings down
the price of work in these parts, anyhow. Know
a gang of six “ good ” men who will take a con-
tract to fall 100 or 200 acres of bush and make All
or .£4 a week each where others would starve.
Reason : 14 hours per day and no step till the
job's finished. They once had a contract to fall
130 acres bush, at 30s. per acre. Started in be-
ginning of Nov., got out by Xmas. They never
saw their camp in daylight from start to finish,
Sundays included. Away before daylight and
not home until after dark ; whilst one cooked the
others ground their axes by slush-light. Boozers
or even moderate drinkers couldn’t have done
that.

“ W.S.” : Have had ocular proof of kan-
garoo’s ability to swim. In spring of ’9B we had
luxuriant herbage, and flies were so bad that fully
25 per cent, of the ’roos were attacked by ophthal-
mia. I ran one, almost blind, into a large tank
18ft. deep, and he struck out in good style,
circling round and round for fully half-an-hour
before he landed, and he was not exhausted then.
He looked not unlike a yearling calf swimming,
and could travel quite as fast.

“A.G.”: lie kangaroos swimming. Throw
any old hen and a vigorous ’roo into a deep water-
hole, and the hen will be paddling long after the
’roo has gone under. There is too much of him
behind to be any good at the game. When he gets
into deep water he assumes a vertical position,
same as an empty bottle, and can’t advance worth
speaking of. The ’roo should be able to “tread
water,” but can’t. I know.

Apropos the recent Bulletin discussion re
the common pig’s susceptibility to snake-poison.
The matter was settled at Broadford, Vic., the
other day, when a tiger-snake bit a fat pig. The
porker attacked his enemy, killed him, and with
piggish philosophy ate him afterwards, and then
made a nest in the straw —and died in one tableau,
without slow music.

tied our horses to the dilapidated fence, and
Steve tumbled over a fossicking hen as we went
through the bar door. “Bricky” knocked upon
the dirty, beer-stained counter, and a greasv,
blear-eyed man appeared through a doorway,
bringing with him the sound of much caterwauling
in the rear. “ Missus hammerin’ the kids,” he
explained. “Mine’s beer,” said Steve. “Got
none,” said the publican. “ Missus gave the las’,
to a swaggy ’smornin’—it was sour.” “Gin,”
said Steve. Pubjican took a bottle from the shelf,
and carefully poured out a nip of gin. “ Brandy, ”
said “ Bricky.” Publican took down the same
bottle, shook it slightly, and gave “ Bricky ” his
brandy. “ Mine’s rum,” I said. Down came the
same old bottle, received a violent shake this
time, and I got ray rum. “ Strong,” said Steve,
winking at me. “ Yes, drop of good tack, that,”
said the publican, proudly. That bottle would
have produced any spirit under the sun if a skilful
hand shook it so as to mix the sediment properly
—and get the right color.

Writer witnessed several high-diving
displays in Sydney lately and came away
disgusted. Few of the local swimmers know
how to enter the water properly, and fewer
still undeistand what a “header” really
is. Saw the competition in London some
years ago for the world’s high-diving cham-
pionship. Contestants sprang from a plat-
form 60ft above water. The winner (Golden,
an American) had a flight as graceful as that
of a bird, and he cut the water with a swish
but no splash. “It might be equalled,”
said the Sporting Life next morning, “ but
it can never be excelled—that is impos-
sible.” Poor Peart, erst of Fitzgerald Bros’.
Ciicus, was placed about twelfth in that
competition.

“ MacKell ”: Been reading to an old
Highlander that “Sporting Notions” par
re catching fish by hand. On my expressing
doubt about it, he explained; “You go
along the river bank on a dark night, and
when you come to a likely spot, such as a
quiet, rocky nook where the water is still,
you just- open the lantern a wee, and look
down in the water, and ye’ll see the fish
sleeping there and you reach down your
hand and stroke and tickle him gently, till
you get your fingers up to his head ; then in
with them under his gills and lift him out
on to the bank. Mon, it’s great sport, my
word!” “Don’t the fish get frightened
at the tickling business?” “Frightened !
mon, they’re fond o’it.” This ought to be
a good tip, in a few years, to the denizens
of the Snowy and Bega river country.
Meanwhile, they could be acquiring the
touch. Trout-tickling is already practised
in Tasmania and Maoriland.
Via ” : The somewhat decayed sport of cock-
fighting is indulged in weekly up Towers way, always on

The emphasised downfall in

tralian Win.” Peter Jackson, Griffo,
Dan Creedon, Joe Goddard, Paddy
Slavin, and Billy Murphy, the all-
conquering sextette who cut such
a wide swathe in the ranks of Yan-

Details of the match between
N.S. Wales Jim Richardson and M.L.
Billy Heffernan, in England, recently, go to
show beyond question that the long, red-
haired bruiser is no longer a factor in the
fighting game, and must now go to work
at something else. Richardson, who billed
himself “down under” as “Champion of
Honolulu,” started favorite at 6 to 4, but
at the close of the first round betting was
at even, with the Maorilander for
choice. From the first call of time to the
word “ out,” except at one period during; the sixth round,
Heffernan did nearly all the fighting. It was a thump-
ing match from beginning to end (seventh round), and
all that the N.S.W. middle-weight had to recommend
him was his pluck.

to quoting Reid 98 against Reid ’99. But, then, Reid is
not a clause, a line, a dot, or a comma in the proposed
Federal Constitution. You will find on examination that
his name is not mentioned in the preamble or any of the
schedules W.P. : We’ll help lame rhymes over the
stile, but can’t throw them over ... Country Journalist:
You say S.M. Herald, per agents, offered you 9s. for two
insertions of a two-inch d.c. advt. Why not? The offer
doesn't hurt you unless you’re flat enough to accept
T.S.N. : You kill the Muse, and want to rhyme the
burial service! Ventnor : The “ Marri’d ” verses were
written for Bulletin by a bright ex-Australian in Para-
guay, and travelled to Sydney Truth via Reynolds’s,
which reprinted them. But The Bulletin is used to that.
Katapult: Notes far too long for subjects and values.
No show whatever unless you boil down. Helen : Always
too weak and misty ; jab yourself with a hat-pin before
writing R. 8.: “Evensong” too elaborate —poetry lost in
metaphors; “Rondeau” commonplace .... E.A. : Correct;
under active-service conditions men and officers “ eat out
of the same pot ” —no officers’ messes being allowed
Wal. : Contributors are “ not required to call about
their MS.” In fact, fhey are required not to call
Edw. W. B. : You can’t expect all the “high judicial
authorities of the provinces ” to be enthusiastic about
Federation. The Chief Justice of a province would,
under the Commonwealth, be but a small potato A.G. :
Do boil it down 1 “An insurance-agent with amorous
tendencies.” Why not “an amorous insurance-agent?"
A. W.N. (Mount Cobalt): “Is a man necessarily a liar
because he says he is one?” Yes. If he is telling the
truth when he says he is a liar, then he is a liar. If he
isn’t telling the truth when he says he’s a liar, then he is
a liar for saying he is a liar when he isn’t a liar Goon-
garrie: Blackfellow theory hardly fills the bill : (1)
Murphy was apparently not shot in the cart—no blood on
cart; (2) If two aboriginals swarmed into cart on road,
shot Murphy, overcame and bound his sisters, there
would be a stoppage, or at least a period when the horse
went where it pleased. But this vehicle was driven
straight with noapparent stoppage ..O K. (Parragundy):
Can’t suggest adequate remedy. Something might be
effected by putting the gentleman into a carefully-fastened
bag along with six cats, a brown snake and a 601 b. dumb-
bell and dropping the lot into a deep water-hole Alorg-
hana : Wrong. A man (or a Christian era) doesn't have
his first birthday till the end of his first year, or his 1900th
birthday till the end of his 1900th year. A man isn't 100
years old till he finishes his 100th year .... Mac. : Even
now the old desire to hang Burgess, just for being a
“ nark,” seems to completely subordinate any wish to
elucidate the triple crime H. Lilly : How would
it be to look up the alleged returns yourself instead
of taking the word of a paper with a very bad
record for lying? .. I.G. (Sydney): Samoan politics are off
our beat. Takes all our lime to look after Australian's
David W. (M.L.): Both dull .... Isley Penn : More husks.
Buzzy : Quite humorless Bellourne : Bunyip very
dead. Cow-fact well-known. Other, may use Con-
stant R. : A mere puerility Native Q. : Yarns to hand ;
will be considered in due course £46 : Subject well-
worn, but may possibly use ... Cullen : Do you really
believe it funny?. J.P. (Tas.) : Too undressed
K. : Good, but painfully minute scribble ...Alack:
Lovely liar ! Boko : Same weary old horse-perjury
J.G. : Nothing in it. Europeans at same game every
day. S.L.P. : To hand ; will get fair show
J.M.C. : Will examine Pros. G. (W.A.): “Lasts.”
acceptable Bar : The wanted-a-coachman-to-fit-a-suit-
of-clothes situation is a veteran chestnut . .. C.C.R. :
Very good Jonathan : Lively, but impossible
Jimmie P. : True, she wasn’t corroborated, but she may
have told the truth all the same ... Seezo : Your hand-
writing doesn’t invite'perusal; it invites us to leave it
severely alone. It would take an hour to read the 10
sides ; in that hour we can read 70 sides of other people’s
MS .. ..Red Light: Thanks Myrius Cyrus (Inverell):
Declined with emphasis W.S. : Mere catalogue of long
names J. Cain : Lengthy poem to the effect that Bob
missed his way in the dark ..“On the Nod”: Nothing
original about mug S.P.P. : Poor but honest item
Belle W. : Subject too well-worn Aero : Argument
fails. Not fair to identify' from portrait alone ... F.C.J. :
No verificatory clipping re that insolvency schedule
Hugo Z. : Your very fair reply' was anticipated by another
writer Gumleaf ': Had to let it go, as you sent no veri-
ficatory cutting P.J.F. : Aboriginal pars, will be
printed in due course P.B.S. : Overstocked with the
Mournful. Give it a rest Ydobon : Sselhtrow
6xB: You’re getting back to the miscroscopic busi-
ness again. Don’t remember what was said about “Poet’s
Defence.” Probably harmless jibe. “ Dairymaid” hardly
up; will consider other Axel: Fine weighty philo-
sophy in those poems—have anchored the office-dog to
’em ...Nil: No stimulus in “Ten Chain.” E.W.L. :
“Susan” poem received Bren.: Little in “Pearler,”
and metre would kill it, anyway J.C. : “ God’s
Son’s initials” under that! Curlew: Please
moan elsewhere... Crosby’s : Brief life was here its por-
tion... Machete : Not quite neat enough. Kuri: We read
it; but you didn’t expect us to print it? .... G.B. (M.L.) :
Not here, my child !... . Sweetbriar : Sorry not up ...

prayer at present... ..Nell C. : To" hand A.L.W.” :
Don’t remember items referred to. “ Shannassey ” re-
ceived 6 x 8 : But you forget that in the child’s case it
was comparative ignorance of danger that sustained her.
Black and White : Ignominious scribble. Don’t
know what it’s all about Winda : No ; you have a
totally' irrelevant “Fones” as well ; also a “Wilson”
(presumably' “ Williams”). Will fix up H.S.T.: Rather
good .. . Root.ee : Fly-blown old legend Dabbler : You
are rather more than that, though you’ve much to learn
still Plato : Curious mixture of strength and weak-
ness Thos. M‘M. (M.L.): Prentice-hand too evident.
Ben Sun : Jingles well, though ideas are cheap and
obvious, and involve the weary old fallacy that only phy-
sical labor is work. And what a fallacy' it is 1 W.M.F. :
“Drought” and “ Selected ” may do. “Hoppy” too
sultry Ambrose J. : Well enough written, but idea
has already seen much service Tim B. : Moderate
merit W.H. : “Tutor” has a promising touch L. S.
Wicke : Fairly well written, but the only thing new
about the situation is the final accident, and that is an
artistic mistake . Pipe : Clever, but inconsequent
C.P.C. : Both ancient .... J.A.W. : Can t stand volumin-
ous pencil-scrawl on colored paper O. M‘G. :An in-
vention. Short for the longer word ... Port Pone : First*
class libel. .Snakejuice : What did you send ?
Dollie E. : Brigham Brown was interesting, but you !
“ I do my best to keep house tidy and send my little ones
to school neat and clean which they are.” Surely you
meant it for the Sunday Times Trackless : On the con-
trary, Bulletin flatters itself that its “ Aboriginalities ”
column has done much to interest people in local ethno-
logy and natural history. Plenty wash in it, perhaps,
but gold also Treb. : No. 2 too trifling
Beoro : No modern play has been more talked about than
“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray.” Yet it fails to attract
the foolish majority of theatre-goers in Australia or any-
where else. Newspaper discussion cannot do niuch for
really high-class theatrical work, although it will serve to
make the fortune of clap-trap plays and players. Witness
“ The Sign of the Cross.” Trebla : The “ respectable ”
press is responsible for Ikey Mo’s cheerful lies re the
amount that the Ring has lost over the victory of an out-
sider. If the press didn’t take him seriously Ike would
not trouble to perjure himself for the encouragement of
foolish punters D.B. (Melb.): May use .... Falladah :
“Stripe’’too slight of interest. Verse has ingenious
idea, but isn’t otherwise up X4BJ. : “Hard-up”
funny, but too slender. Will look-up other. Jabbie :
It just misses... Dab.: On both sides of paper!
W.C.C. : “ Colonial-wine ”-and-blackfellow yarn old and
already told here .. Sc.: Illicit-stills are more expensive,
you see, than illicit babies, but they don’t come to light
so often Perce: To illustrate the indecency of such
places of entertainment by such indecent quotations
would earn us six months E. O. Cray : The question
of the release of Willoughby Andrew is a purely-medical
one. Does the Inspector-General of the Insane consider
it safe to set the prisoner free ? That is the only issue.
Paddington : Thanks .... Bob: Butcher’s horse well-
written but hardly big enough episode R.J.M. : Mel-
bourne Methodist Speck is not worth arguing about
R.T. (Charters Towers): Some of them will do .... F.H. :
You “ never yet knew'a dairyman to clean out a pig-sty.”
Well, writer has known of some dairymen who never
cleaned out anything E.A.B : M.’sP. in Norway, we
read, receive 11s. 4d. a day while in session, but are
allowed besides medical attendance, dentistry, massage
and bathing free. In Denmark members can command
free seats at the theatre. In Hungary Govt, pajs mem-
bers’ house rent, and in the U. States members are
allowed £25 a year for stationery... A.E. : The Govern-
ment’s “complicity with the shipowners in the Fre-
mantle Labor trouble ” is shown, for example, by the fact
that no person was granted access to Fremantle (public)
wharf without a written order from the Adelaide S.S. co. ..
M. Beck : You lie like an artist, at all events Borax :
May use .. .A.S.W. : Too stiff a dose D.B.R. : Mouldy
chestnut .. M. Norris : Verse vigorous, but impracticable
in places Foghorn : “He swore to reck an awful ven-
geance.” Enough ! ... F.K. : Have given you plenty of
rope, and got insolent abuse in return. Will return MS.,

like to see copies of that thief-paper ... Imray : Begins
well, though grandiloquently ; but fails off, • and ends
feebly Tom 6. : “ O.’s Revenge” painfully mechanical
humor. “Ezra” deadly dull G.P.B. : Put “ W.” for
“ G.”, and you’ve got it. You have humor, though, and

your word conveys exactly the opposite of your meaning.

That boys who are , allowed by their
parents plenty of liberty to play about
the streets or parks, are curious and in-
quisitive, and that they are no respecter,
of persons, was borne in upon the mem-
bers of the Ministr>\ yesterday, while the
Cabinet was engaged inspecting the
proposed route of the Collingwood line,
along Wellington Parade, and the sug-
gested deviations. About Highett
street, as the party was standing around
the Engineer-in-Chief, examining a map,
several of the juveniles elbowed tlfcir
way towards the map, and proceeded to •
ask questions that amounted to an in-
. vitation to Sif George Turner to explain
his presence there. “Are you goin’ to
* build the railway, mister?" asked one
1 youngster, addressing the head of the
Government;” it’s about time you did
something, you know.” The Premier
made some evasive reply, when his in-
terrogator said, “Oh, we kribw you;
you're Sir George Turner,; you jist got '
to say ‘Start,' and the railway starts:
,oh, we kpow.” ♦ _•

A MAMMOTH HOCK TOR SYDNEY
For Mort’s Dock and Engineering Co. Ltd., Sydney, N.S.W.
- Proposed Woolwich Dockyard, New Graven a Dock and Encineerind Works. __
—» lT ■■■ H I ■■•■■■■* « r ■"! tf ' ■ --■■■■■■» «»%....» •■.■■■■■* -* - ‘
ONE of the most noticeable things about recent
developments of maritime commerce is the
rapidity with which marine architects have got
ahead of the dock accommodation of the world.
Improvements in mechanical construction, but especially
in marine engines, have enabled steamship owners to
reach, and— in one instance even to eclipse— the dimen-
sions of the mammoth Great Eastern, and instead of the
result being unweildv monsters always breaking down
and coming to grief, we have great craft resembling float-
ing cities and with hold capacity to carry the produce of
a countryside, and which are yet as easily handled as a
ferry-boat and consume no more coal than the compara-
tively small intercolonial and coastal traders of a few
years back. To accommodate these leviathans the world
has but few great docks. Here in Sydney we were
thought to be exceptionally well provided, but the
trade of Port Jackson and the size of the ocean-going
steamers frequenting it have increased so enormously
within the last year or two that it has actaally become a
commercial necessity to provide another great dock,
which will rank among the very largest in the world. To
meet the current need of the intercolonial trade the
directors of Mort’s Dock and Engineering Company
decided about a year since to lengthen their graving dock
at Balmain to 640 ft. on the floor, divided by a centre
caisson at various positions in the dock, so that repairs
could be carried on to a vessel at one end while another
vessel could be cleaning and painting at the other end
without interfering with the one under repairs, or dock
two vessels of 3500 tons each at the same time, thus
avoiding any detention. The advantage of this has been
proved during the wool season, as the company has been
able to fully cope with all requirements without
causing delay with any of the shipping com-
panies with the assistance of the Government docks
for the few large vessels that have required to
dock for cleaning and painting. The Government has
two large graving docks capable of docking vessels up to
15,000 tons. Mort’s Dock Company has already a dock
640 ft. long, as well as two patent slips, power, 1000 and
2000 tons respectively ; two floating docks, each capable
of taking 1400 tons. In spite of all this accommodation
there is still further need, and the directors of the com-
pany now foresee that if Sydney is to maintain her posi-
tion as the principal port in the East private accommoda-
tien must be provided for docking large vessels now
trading here, and due allowance must be made for the
probable increase in size in the near future. They have,
consequently, commenced to construct a large graving
dock at their recently-acquired engineering establish-
ment at Woolwich. This is an exceptionally good posi-
tion, as it is well sheltered and close to the city and.
enjoys a good half-hourly steam ferry service. The
company intends that the great bulk of the docking
will be done as heretofore at Balmain, but the new dock
will relieve any congestion during the busy season,
besides being able to accommodate the large vessels which
at the present time are docked at the Government dock.
It is not anticipated that the new dock, for some time to
come, will be employed for more than three months in
the year, so that the docking accommodating in Sydney
will provide for a large expansion in shipping, and will,
in all probability, be ample for very many years to come.
To enable the new work to be carried out Mort’s Dock
and Engineering Company, Limited, is being recon-
structed, and the capital increased to provide funds to
carry out so great art undertaking.
The new dock when finished will be able to accommo-
date any merchant steamer up to 20,000 tons, the prin-
cipal dimensions being 660 ft. long on the floor (it is so
designed that it may be lengthened to 750 ft. at some
future time), the width of entrance will be 83ft., and the
depth of water on the sill at ordinary spring tides 28ft.,
so that vessels may be floated out at any state of the tide.
There will be a dividing caisson in the centre, so as to
enable both ends to be used independently. It w'U be
the largest dock outside Europe, and, therefore, Sydney
will be the only place in which some of the leviathan
battleships now being constructed can be docked should
they be sent to the China Seas.
The dock basin will hold about 48,( 00 tons, or lOf
million gallons, and this immense quantity of water will
be operated on by three centrifugal pumping engines,
capable of discharging 15,000 tons per hour, and of
emptying the dock in about two and a-half to three hours.
It will lie frilly equipped with steam cranes, capstans,
electric light, and all the necessary tools and appli-
ances for cleaning and repairing vessels expeditiously
and at most reasonable rates. The large workshops
already erected, comprising engineers’, boilermakers’,
blacksmiths’, founders’, coppersmiths’, joiners’, ship-
wrights’, and painters’ shops will be equipped with all the
most modern appliances and conveniences for doing re-
pairs well, expeditiously and economically.
The berthing accommodation will be about 1800 ft., and
will enable vessels of 15,000 tons to berth alongside the
works at any state of the tide.
Our illustration, from the engineer’s drawing, gives a
good idea of the appearance the dock and its surround-
ings will have when completed. The property has a front-
age to the Parramatta River of about 1000 ft. and 800 ft. to
the Lane Cove River.
Every exertion is to be made by the company to open
the first section of the dock in 18 months from date, so as
to accommodate the intercolonial steamers and the wool
ships in the wool season of 1900.

WHAT SEVERAL WOMEN WHO SAW
DARK SHADOWS HAVE TO SAY.
“In every shadow she saw a ghost.”
These words described the condition of a woman
driven almost to hysteria by worry. Not by some
overwhelming shock, but by the endless little
irritations of life which wear out the body as the
constant friction of a pulley wears out the stoutest
rope.
There is nothing more firmly settled in medicine
than that the fretting inseparable from the home-
keeping life of woman strikes at every important
part of the physical machinery; particularly at
the kidneys and adjacent organs.
When these organs go wrong the heart-beats are
irregular, and there is pain in the breast. A bad
taste in the mouth and heaviness in the stomach
tell of indigestion. Dots dance before the eyes,
and the hands and feet are like lumps of ice.
Small wonder it is that women so afflicted get
nervous and fanciful, and start at shadows. What
is to be done ? Let these women answer.
Miss Ross Waring, of Sydney, writes under
date of Aug. 28, ’9B : “ I have much pleasure in
testifying to the benefit I have received from
Warner’s Safe Cure. Having suffered for some
time from liver complaint, I have found this
preparation to afford instant and permanent relief,
and I can recommend it with confidence.”
Mrs. J. Clarke, storekeeper, Donald, Vic.,
writes : “This is to certify that I have taken War-
ner’s Safe Cure for backacke and liver complaint,
and I am pleased to state that I was entirely cured
by the same.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems. *

POLITICAL
POINTS
Q. Ministerial motto : “ Sugar at any
price.” & J
N. S. W. Legislative Council—Dr. M ‘Laurin
and his patients.
The N.S.W. anti-Federalists’ difficulty in
securing a leader is just as great as in finding
supporters for him.
-Eighty per cent, of the N.S.W. country
press were pro-Bill at last referendum; 95 per
cent. pro-Bill is the estimate now.
“J. 0.” : Two-thirds of the N.S.W. runs
are said to be in pledge. The Federal capital then
should be either Uncleton or Popopolis.
The DIRTY BACK-DOOR.
This stamp-design was late-
ly submitted to the Tasma-
nian Government but was
not accepted.
A testimonial to
M'Farlane, M.P., is
being got up by the Cla-
rence sugar-growers as
a token of gratitude for
his share in the “sav-
ing ” of the N.S.W.
sugar-industry. It is ex-
pected to realise about
.£250, and will be pre-
sented during Premier
Reid’s jaunt to the
river in April. There
is much local newspaper
war as to whom be-
longs the credit of the
duty being retained.
No doubt the Pre-
mier will take along
his little version with
him—and it will not be
political necessity.
Westralia tia>s disrolled the two Northern
J’s.P. (Brockman and de Pledge) found guilty of
gross cruelty to aboriginals indentured to them.
But there is no intimation that the indentures of
the wretched blacks have been cancelled.
All that has been said about the secret
provincial tendencies of N.S.W. Assembly seems
to have been uufounded. The As-
sembly proves to represent N.S. Wale..,
and not merely Sydney. The first
time that body got a chance to secretly
injure Federation—to injure it with-
out compromising itself with its con-
stituents—was at the secret ballot for
the appointment of 10 M'sL.A. to
fight out the question of the amend-
ments in conference with the Council.
The Assembly might have appointed
10 provincialists, who would give way
on every point, and the secret ballot
would have prevented the appointment
being sheeted home to anyone. And
it put Barton, the boss Federalist ot
the crowd, at the head of the 10 with
67 votes —more than half the entire
Assembly, and apparently almost a
block vote of the members present,
seeing that the Telegraph puts them
down at something “over 70.” A
day or two before, Cotton, M.L.A.,
had declared that a ballot would show
there were not 20 Federalists in the
Assembly. Also, the wild, sprawling
G. Dibbs had been prophesying that
the Assembly would probably accept
the Council’s amendments bodily.
“If N.S.W. be so Billite, wny
growl at the Leg. Council’s amendment
making it indispensable that a quarter
of the electors should vote ? ” is a
question asked every half-hour, and
expected to ‘' knock ” all and sundry
in the Federal camp. But first, it is
just possible that the weather may go
wrong on polling-day; second, the ab-
sence of a personal issue may make
N.S.W. men even sleepier and lazier
than usual; third, N.S.W. has vir-
tually promised the other provinces to
take the test of an actual majority;
and fourth—and probably a stronger
reason for dissent than all the others
put together —Federalists object to
nave any handicap placed on them
by anti-Federalists, and especially by
the anti-Federalists of a nominee and
otherwise undemocratic body.
E. B. Forrest, who topped the poll at N.
Brisbane, is a pugnacious politician who must be
given a portfolio or otherwise disposed of. He is
just the sort of man to floor the Govt, if not
placated.
The achievement of Q. elections was the
magnificent poll in favor of Independent-Labor
candidate Walker at Moreton. This gentleman
found himself at the bottom of the list with
exactly four votes.
The capitation-grant struggle in South
Australia is severely straining the loyalty of some
Laborites; and the dying message of their old
leader, J. A. M'Pherson—“ Tell the boys to stick
together is being used for all it is worth as a
rallying-cry.
Elections approach, and the unemployed
are being adroitly stirred in Adelaide. They are
being invited to be particularly contemptuous of
the Govt.’s new Labor Bureau. But the Adelaide
unemployed are agitated with difficulty; city and
suburbs are too scattered.
Louis F. Heydon, of N.S.W. Upper
House, complains, in one of his bovine gusts of
passion that Victoria built a tariff wall around
her borders in order to keep N.S. Wales’ products
out, and also reduced her railway-rates 66 per
cent. s° as to draw N.S. W. products in. And L.
. Heydon is against Federation for both reasons.
R. Archbishop O’Reilly is counselling
every member of his flock in S.A. to vote for the
candidate, regardless of other opinions, who
favors a capitation grant, and the Anglicans, who
have private schools everywhere, are quietly
talcing the same position. The other churches are
ranged in opposition, and a lovely sectarian war
has already begun.
S. Labor-party has resolved to attack
two more country seats, and, by a coincidence,
the present senior member is in each case a Minis-
ter. Healy is to run for the Burra, Treas. Holder’s
district; ; and Kirkpatrick for Frome, which re-
turns Lands-Minister O’Loughlin. The avowed
intention in both instances is to win the second
seats, which are now held by Conservatives.
Labor-member Hughes was one of the
few members of N.S.W. Assembly who spoke in
favor of requiring a minimum affirmative vote of
one-fourth of the electors before Federation could
be accepted. Yet Hughes himself never got the
support of one-fourth of the electors of his own
constituency, and if that rule had been applied to
him he might never have been in politics at all.
Politicians out of place : O’Sullivan, Cot-
ton, and M‘Gowen, of N.S.W. Assembly, sup-
ported the Leg. Council’s “ three months ” amend-
ment re the date of the referendum ; Haynes and
egan supported the minimum vote of one-
tourth ; and Cotton, Hughes, Fegan, and Haynes
supported the compulsory inclusion of Queensland.
Holman (!) paired for the Council on all its amend-
ments.
Question in N.S.W. Assembly the other
: l< Does the Government propose to bring in
a Bill for the reform of the Council ?” Premier
Keid (who has fought two elections largely on the
promise of Council-reform), looking out with a
glazed and dreamy eye over his barrel-shaped
weskit: “ I have some slight recollection of a
matter of that kind having been brought under
my notice.”
The position of Glassey in the new Q. As-
sembly will be a big take-down to his ineffable
vanity. Hardly one of his personal friends has
been returned to Parliament. He will be sur-
rounded by the. Northern and Central Democrats,
who are heartily sick of his leadership, and by
the supporters of the Worker policy, who dislike
him intensely. Quite time they had a leader with
a head on his shoulders.
FEDERATED AUSTRALIA—THE DIBBSIAN IDEA.
If the electors of N.S.W. wanted an in-
ducement to vote unanimously for the Federal
Bill they got it when the papers published the
minority-iist in the Assembly.
Twelve burly policemen guarded Premier
Dickson when he went on the platform to assist
Charles Powers against a hostile Bundaberg audi-
ence. No wonder the spectators stormed; no
wonder they howled ! If Dickson had but taken
his historical kanaka with him, the procession
would have been complete and beautiful.
Strange fossils that even the veteran
parliamentary reporters of the dailies couldn’t
identify at first, rose up in N.S.W. Council on the
night of the great debate to talk against Feder-
ation Even old man Macintosh was hardly known
by sight, though he is by no means the most obscure
of the crowd, and half the paper scribes had only
a vague idea that his name was Waterproof, or
something like that.
The Bulletin has received a number of
free pie-passes from an all-night Sydney-street
saveloy-vendor, who also sends a letter pointing
out that the majority of his present customers con-
sist of M.P’s., cabmen, burglars, dirt-box-rakers,
and belated upper-class drunks, and that should
the Federal capital be fixed elsewhere he will
necessarily lose many customers, and perhaps be
compelled to shift his potato-can hundreds of
miles. What is he to do ? Bulletin advises him
to consult G. Republican Dibbs, Tom Slattery,
and ex-Mayor Riley on the subject; also G. Pile
and dog, Grimley, and Eagar.
When the N.S.W. provincialists (Cotton,
Dibbs, and others) started their theory that the
Cornstalk Assembly, if a secret ballot were taken,
would be found largely against the Federal Bill,
they made a horrible bungle of their own argu-
ment. If members vote openly for the Bill but, as
the provincialists allege, would like to vote secretly
against it, the only reason can be that they know
the country is for it, and that if they openly
opposed it they would be thrown out first chance.
The anti-Billious crowd asserts that the oountry
is against the Bill, and the same anti-Billious
crowd also asserts that members are dishonestly
voting for it to keep square with the country.
Poor old Duncan Gillies has fallen so low
in Vic. politics that he is now forced to bid for
the “football vote.” Hitherto, all the pandering
to the calves of the local twenty and their bar-
rackers has been done by the aspirants of the
A.N.A. debating-olass, but last week witnessed
the old pride of the Vic. Tories orating largely on
the advisableness of re-establishing a senior foot-
ball club at Prahran.
The present Q. elections emphasise the cry
that Separation is now a Rockhampton question,
pure and simple. In no other town in Central or
Northern Queensland was the least attention paid
to the matter, and in the Central District (outside
Rockhampton) the indifference was the most pro-
nounced of all. As for the North — it calculates
on getting all the portfolios soon and transferring
the seat of Government to Townsville.
“ Br’er Alec’s ” Perth Morning Herald,
which came into the field to shake up the old
Sandgroper press, seems to have at last quite made
up its mind that there is most grass on the Oppo-
sition side of the fence. It has, therefore, dared
to say that Bigjohn has been talking all twaddle
lately, and it comes to the conclusion that his
Govt.’s “ chief accomplishment seems to be that of
bungling everything which it takes in hand ”!! !
The only Hoolan (just before the elec-
tion) : “ After they (the Labor - party) have
squeezed the orange dry, they seek to throw it on
the dunghill; but lam not one of that sort.”
The election has squeezed J. Hoolan dry enough—
and Cairns is the dunghill whereon he reposes. . . .
To make matters worse, the Burke has gone and
rejected John’s independent Labor-nominee in
favor of a supporter of the accursed 40-plank plat-
form. Sad!
Q. Labor-party has been greatly strength-
ened, not by the new blood it has taken in, but
by the impure stuff it has cast out. The rejection
of the shuffling members by important constitu-
encies is bound to have an important disciplinary
effect —an effect emphasised by the fact that
straight Democrats were returned in all cases bub
Maranoa) in place of the ratting
Apostles of Freedom,” as the Govt, press
grandiloquently calls them.
The present Federal scrimmage is getting
well on in its fifth year. It was somewhere about
hept., 94, that Premier Reid asked the other
Premiers to meet him at Hobart and discuss
means of bringing Federation about. They met
in Jan., 95, and drafted the Enabling Bill, and
after much hazy dreaming over it the election of
delegates came off in March, ’97. Then two years
were spent fixing up the details of the scheme,
and now, at the beginning of April, ’99, the anti-
Federalists are still grieved over the “ undue pre-
cipitancy ’’ that has been shown.
“ HIS TROUBLES."
"Please do not walk in front of pavilion during
an over !”
The French move in the Bahr-el-Ghazal
seems to have been largely a ruse to obtain an
acknowledged right to the unallotted country
about Lake Tsad, and the vast sphere extending
up to Tripoli. This means that the whole
of Africa, except Abyssinia and one or two little
isolated states is now subject more or less to
Europe. It is significant, by the way, that the
majority of cable-editors ignored Egypt altogether
as a party to the new agreement between Britain
and France.
Curious what tireless roads-and-bridges
men several of the best Speakers have been.
Abbott, of N.S.W., for instance; and Coles, of
o.A. It is Abbott’s punctilious attention to
local correspondence and his apparent intense
interest in the bridge over Dead-dog Creek that
make his hold on Wentworth so firm; and
Jenkin Coles will trip off to his Light electorate
if more than two or three constituents write
putting the same question to him about current
legislation.
Ex-Premier Dibbs, in the Sunday Shell-
back
I would not be the least surprised if the Assembly com-
pels Mr. Reid to accept every one of the Council's
amendments. From conversations I have had with
members of the Assembly, I believe the amendments will
be accepted. The Melbourne people are very sore at the
opposition. 1 met one of them to-day, and he was grossly
abusive and insulting regarding Sydney and its people,
i reminded him that Melbourne was settled and estab-
lished by Sydneyites. (Beautifully irrelevant.) But
one can stand all that.
Poor old Dibbs is as bad at prophecy as at history.
For N.S.W. Assembly threw the Council’s amend-
mentsout on their ear, and Melbourne was first
settled in an unofficial sort of way by expeditions
from Tasmania. The site of the city was after-
wards decided on by an Englishman (Capt. Lons-
dale), and another Englishman (Hoddle) laid it
out. Also, the bulk of the settlers came direot
from England - the most that the Sydney Govern-
ment did in that bygone time being to annex the
land-fund of Port 2?hillip and to discourage all
immigration from the older parts of the province
to the new district. The real beginning of Vic-
toria, however, was not Melbourne, but the old,
sleepy western town of Portland, and it was also
settled by Tasmanians—the Hentys—one of whose
descendants figures in a firm which has of late
years had the insolence to set up a branch busi-
ness in Sydney.

The Bulletin has always had a kind of tender-
ness for John Norton—that streaky mixture of ail sorts of
instincts—but he’s uncommonly like a wild-cat: you
never know whether he’ll slaver you or scratch you ; and
Norton doesn’t know either. Last week he aimed at this
paper with a dab of the venomed claw, when the Truth
editor told “ Tattersall ” Adams that—
“ You have managed to practically bribe the most in-
fluential of the Australian newspapers (including the Syd-
ney Bulletin) into silence by coin paid for big “ fat " ad-
vertisements.”
Which made The Bulletin smile and turn up its file of
Jan. 22, 1898, where, at the head of “ Sporting Notions,”
this par. was printed :
“So far, nothing has been heard from George Adams
in the matter of protecting his sweep-patrons from rac-
ing blackmailers. ‘ Tattersall ’ draws a large income
from the Australian sporting public, and, hitherto, his
name has been synonymous with probity and honor. But
the ‘ information’-leakages in his office —most of them
must be from his office—are disgusting many of his best
friends and supporters. If you draw a horse in ‘ Tatter-
sail’s’ sweep nowadays, you risk receiving a demand
from the owner for half the prize, accompanied with the
significant threat that, if you don’t agree, the horse
won't run. That sort of thing stinks. You pay your
money down in the faith that you will receive the adver-
tised prize, and it is disgraceful that you should be bled
by the horse-owner—acting on information which, as
already remarked, must, in the great majority of cases,
be received from some of * Tattersali’s ’ officials. George
Adams has so far dealt honestly with the Australian
public, and no one grudges him the handsome commission
on his enterprise. Let him continue to see that his
clients are dealt by squarely, and draw his sweeps on the
day of the race, or there will presently be room in his
business for someone else with better methods.”
There is more point in that par. than in columns of
Norton’s crusading blatherskite and grotesque self-
praise, which it preceded by over a year. In fact, The
Bulletin believes this was about the first pointed
criticism of “ Tattersall” that appeared ; and it has been
followed up in these columns (which have, and had all
along, been printing Tatt.’s “fat advts.”) on many
occasions since, long before the magniloquent John
flamed into adjectival fury. And The BuLLETiN’scriticism,
besides being early, was just; much of Norton’s isn’t just,
in addition to the fact that John comes in very late in the
day. The “Tattersall” business has been mismanaged, and
run on bad methods; but if it comes to a question of
personal honesty between George Adams and John
Norton, this paper believes in George Adams, and so does
everybody else who knows “ the old man.” There is only
one tangible statement in Norton’s last three-column
assault, and that points out that George Adams collared
an allegedly dishonest official at Brisbane sweep-drawing,
and stopped his game. That, singularly enough, is appa-
rently given as a proof of Adams’s dishonesty !
There can be no question that, if “ Tattersall’s ”
sweeps are to go on, the vicious practices connected with
them must be promptly ended. Whatever foolish ad-
visers tell him, The Bulletin asks, and has many times
asked, Mr. Adams to break with the past and start a
better system for the future. All sweeps to be drawn on
the day of the race. No quarter (and no third—nothing)
to blackmailing horse-owners. Unclaimed moneys to be
advertised at once and continuously. If not claimed, the
money to be held in a public fund for a definite period
before distribution among charities.
* * • •
As most people guessed, it was not long after
Sydney D.T. took to publishing “Tatt.’s" results that
the same journal roped in a big double-column advt. pro-
claiming 1 the virtues of “ Tattersall.” Does this step of
the Govt.-respecting D.T. presage the early return of
“ Tatt.” from his island exile to—say. the Federal
capital ?
* * ’ * *
Year after year the best three-year-old is hailed
by Australian sporting writers as “the colt of the cen-
tury,” and “ better than Carbine.” Dreadnought, New-
haven, Aurum, and now Bobadil have each been gushed
over. In the case of the first three, they did nothing
after three years, and though Bobadil has done well to
date, he has still to equal the old horse’s two Sydney Cups
under 9st. and 9.9, and his second and first in Melb. Cups
under lOst. and 10.5 Besides, they were racehorses then.
To be champion amongst horses' like Abercorn, Melos,
Marvel, Lochiel, &c., is different to being champion now.
Carbinier and Iramoo, from the Miller stable,
are both of them likely to distinguish themselves at
Onkaparinga. The Carbine horse was short of condition
when he ran at Flemington, the other week, but he did
sufficiently well, and may snap the Onkaparinga Cup.

A deputation approached the Bible Christian
Conference at Adelaide the other day on the well-worn
subject of the tote and its horrors, and asked the confer-
ence to put its big flat blucher on the evil thing. One
member stated, by way of evidence, that ten small boys
were recently found playing pitch-and-toss, and eight of
them were Sunday-school scholars. If this means any-
thing, it means that it is necessary to immediately sup-
press Sunday-schools.
* * * *
“ We will want a slow bowler !” is the chorus
of the departed Australian team from selectors down-
ward, but they left Giffen and M‘Kibbin behind, and
there is no Harry Trott. It certainly looks as if—Giffen
being, apparently, impossible for “certain reasons”—
M‘Kibbin might have been taken and the chance of
being no-balled for throwing risked. As it is, there is not
a slow bowler in the team. M‘Leod and Noble are
medium-pacers. Who does not remember that Harry
Trott’s “googlers” won the second test in England last
time?
* * * *
The Adelaide match tended to confirm the
opinion that the Australian XI. is weak in bowling.
Howell, Trumble, and Jones were comparatively harm-
less on a wieket that helped them much ; Noble only-
bowled well for a few overs. M‘Leod, who took 8 wickets
for 94 in the two innings, was the only one who bowled
well. In the face of this the decision to pick Laver and
Trumper and ignore Giffeu and M‘Kibbin is a very risky
one.
• * • *
Bad luck for the Australian team if Kelly’s
illness proves serious. He has suffered from an ear-
trouble for weeks, and in Adelaide it became so serious
that an ear-specialist performed an operation. It is
expected that the voyage ’Ome will finish the cure.
• * * *
At Adelaide, Iredale shone out as the sound
batsman of the Australian XI., but his batting- was pain-
fully slow ; in fact, it looks as if the team will tire the
crowd once Darling and Hill are disposed of. Atone
time, in Adelaide, Iredale and Gregory took 70min. to
make 35 runs on a perfect wicket. The only other bats
who starred in the match were the erratic Fred. Jarvis,
Jack Lyons and Trumper. The latter’s batting was
beautiful, but his intense nervousness must be conquered
if he is to succeed in England.
* * * *
Geo. Giffen is the most popular cricketer in
S.A. just now, but feeling against Darling is so strong
that when he went out to bat on the Saturday he was
greeted with a storm of hoots. The S.A. public attribute
Giffen’s exclusion to Darling and Trumble; Gregory is
believed to have strongly advocated his inclusion.
* * * •
Giffen never bowled better than he did last
week against the flower of Australian batting. In the
first innings he secured four for 99 and had four chances
missed off him, and in the second his bowling was nigh
unplayable.
* • * *
The idiosyncraeies of the Adelaide crowd : —
At the recent cricket-match they wildly cheered Jarvis
when making his score of 75, and hooted him an hour
later when he missed a hard catch. Giffen was cheered
every time he got a ball past a batsman, but when he was
hit to the boundary there was stony silence. Each of
the selectors was received with groans, and if Major
Wardill had had to go in to bat there would have been a
gory riot.
* * * *
One of the most pathetic sights ever seen was
the spectacle of George Giffen shaking hands with and
saying good-bye to his deadly enemy, Major Wardill, on
board the Ormuz at Largs Bay. What their real feelings
were is another question, but one spectator, a prominent
member of S.A. Cricket Association, was so overwhelmed
at the spectacle that he went and shook hands with a
parrot which was pathetically shrieking “ mother 1” in the
steerage.
* » * •
The “deep-thinking expert ” cricket editor for
Melb. Age has committed himself to the opinion that
Laver will be a failure in England.
* • * •
Giller’s claims to a place in the Australian XI
were never seriously thought of in N.S.W., yet he is
eighth in batting and third in bowling in first-class
cricket for the season.
* * * *
There are many conflicting rumors as to the
terms on which Trumper has been taken to England with
the Australian XI. One that he receives f'2 per week
and his expenses ; another £2OO, his exes, and a bonus if
he does anything remarkable ; and Major Wardill states
that, “so far as he knows, Trumper is to receive the
same share as other members of the team.” There should
be no doubts on such a matter. It appears Kelly only
had a half-share last trip, and a rotten precedent was
thus established. As three players form the selection
committee, and cash may — The Bulletin does not say it
now does—hereafter outweigh the desire to see Austra-
lian cricket on top, there is apparently nothing to pre-
vent the selectors from picking any second-rater who has
an ambition to make the trip and will go cheap. If
th ngs are not altered we may see something like this :
“Tenders are invited from cricketers willing to form an
Australian team for England. Tenderers to state whether
they are prepared to pay their own expenses ; also
what salary is expected, if any. The highest, or any
ability, not necessarily accepted.” By that time cricket
will probably be as dead as Julius Caesar.

Victoria, as premier province for the year,
grumbled at the small representation awarded it in the
“ test ” matches-only 7 to N.S. W.’slO. The averages-
table, compiled to include only matches for the Sheffield
Shield and test-matches, and not bolstered up with those
against Tasmania and M.L., show the grievance to be
well founded. In batting Victoria claims sof the first 10
and 4 out of 8 bowlers, Trumble, M‘Leod, and Giller being
actually the first three.

“ Newhaven ” Jackson took the double at Vic.
League sports on Saturday—the mile Vic. championship
and the five-mile Australasian championship both falling
to him. Walne’s tyre punctured in the heat of the mile,
and he failed to show up at all in the long race. The
slow-run final of the mile caused the odds of 5 to 6 on
Jackson to veer round to 2 to 1 on Walker during the
running, but the Canadian lurched half a wheel in the
lightning lap at the end.
The crowd that infested the “ outside ” ring at
Melb. Exhibition on Saturday provided a fair index to the
present position of cycling’in Australia. The “Rats”
push and former members of that esteemed organisation,
promoted to big cigars and shiny belltoppers, occupied
nearly half the space, and writer counted no less than
10 convicted men (mind you, men he has seen convicted—
picking pockets, welshing, confidence, and assault and
robbery) swelling it where betting-tickets were thickest.
The elaborate cycling club promoted by Vic.
League, and opened with a glorious flourish of trumpets
by Chief Justice Madden, is now a thing of the past, and
only awaits the auctioneer and the vanman. It has ever
been a huge white elephant. To oblige about a dozen
cycling hangers-on who loafed round the bar, the League
has been losing money steadily ever since it took the
premises. Not one out of 20 members ever set foot in
the place.
M.L. bikisfc Reynolds, paced by triplet and
tandem, skipped over a mile on Auckland Domain in
ziuin. io o-osec. —a world's grass record.

Five hundred people howled themselves hoarse
in favor of one side or the other—you could hear them
streets away —when Martin was declared winner of
oolden Gate Club (Sydney) 9st. 41b. tournament. Satur-
day night last Martin and Webster had fought four
savage, gruelling rounds —Martin rushing, head-down,
most of the tune, till at last, with a full head of steam
shfiLilder fetched up good and hard against
Webster s victualling-department, sending him beyond
recall during the allotted lOsec. Referee explained that
he did not think the foul intentional, and awarded
Martin the money—hence the uproar. On this reasoning
a man might—accidentally, of course—kick another into
oblivion and still win. “ Push” rules, surely.

Jack M'Gowan, the pocket Adonis who has in
his time knocked out so many Australian featherweights,
but who was outpointed by the heavier, lengthier, and
reachier” Tot Higgins at Melb. the other night, after
15 rattling rounds, is a marvel as pugs, go, and stands as
a reproach to the Yankee and British artists who live on
the reputation of one fight for a year or two. The father
of two rising lightweights, Jack still looks a mere lad at
28, and, though he fights on an average twice a month
.' s evei Y wee k, he bears not a mark of either.
M Cowan has probably fought more fights in the past two
years than all the pugdom of the Yewnited States during
the same period. But, instead of talking over his last
scrap until he is shamed into the next, John seems to
regard fighting simply as the day’s work, and goes on
with it just as another man punches clay or writes para-
graphs.

Champion Harry Dunn, after coming out top
dog in a dozen or more matches against the world’s
‘ rasthng” wonders, met his Waterloo last Saturday at
Agri. Society’s Ground (Sydney) in a very simple manner.
Deplorably off in condition and recognising nobody of
note among the names of the entrants, Dunn went out to
“pick up” the money offered. Bad and all as he was,
Harry easily accounted for one, Martin, but ran against a
snag in German strong man Pagel, competing under the
name of Williams. Pagel, an absolute novice at the
game but fit as a fiddle, grasped the situation imme-
diately and went purely on the defensive—making Dunn
do all the work, until latter became exhausted, which
soon happened. Dunn secured one fair collar-and-elbow
style, and Pagel got the other two. In catch-as-catch-
can Harry went to the bridge early to have a spell, but
received such a severe mauling from the Teutonic Samson
that he had perforce to cry go. Another instance of a
strong, well-trained comparative novice at the business
settling a champion who, in train, could beat a paddock-
ful of chumps.

A.U.S.N. team won the tug-of-war champion-
ship in connection with St. Patrick’s Day sports, finished
at Agri. Society’s grounds (Sydney) Saturday last. Ten
teams of ten men each competed. Winners were all
brawny, deep-chested, hard-fisted wharf - laborers—
average weight, 15st. (J|lb. Dalton (18st. 61b), Sherry
(17.2), and Cummings (16.4) hung on to the back end of
the hemp as if fixed there. Police team made the best
showing against the horny-handed lumpers ; won one
pull, and might have got away with the other but their
hands were too soft for the business. A boom in tug-of-
war contests is imminent—writer knows of 20 teams in
active training.

Champion-swimmer “Mud” Bishop and Fred
Lane meet for the fifth time this season at Fitzroy Dock,
Cockatoo Island, to-day(Saturday)over a 100yds. straight-

nothing interferes with arrangements made at time of
writing, Lane will leave for Melb. immediately after the
race so as to catch the England-bound Orient-liner
Omrah. Both men have been training hard for to-day’s
contest. Most good judges think Bishop will win after a
hot struggle, but writer’s dollar is going on Lane.

Vic. eight-oar championship fell to Ballarat
club on Saturday, when the goldfields’ crew, full of
stamina, easily put down the three competing metro-
politan clubs. This season, the championship was
decided on points, instead of falling to the winners of the
eight-oared race, but, as things fell out, it was all the
same. Dawson, the sculling crack, stroked the winning
crew. The race was pulled against a strong tide and
heavy wind, and was by far the slowest on record—2lmin.
55sec.
« * • *
Rupert Clarke, a titled Vic. personage, by no
means “on his uppers,” drew' the w'inner in “Tatt.’s”
Ballarat Cup sweep. Some years ago, a woman, whose
house was mortgaged, borrowed 55., got a ticket, and
drew £9OO. The mortgage was cleared, and her husband
promptly drank himself to death. Some people have
luck.

Notable features about N.S. W. bowling-rink
championship, concluded last week, were that the last
three rinks left in came from the one club (City), and
were all that body was represented by. One of the two
teams that contested the final was got together privately
and in opposition to the wishes of the committee which
had selected two representative quartets ; and yet those
who went in “ on their own ” were only beaten by three
points after leading most of the journey. Bookmaker
Bill Lyons was one of them, and he played a perfect
game. Muir, Hoskings, Hale, and Harris were the
winners. City Club now has the individual champion
and the champion four for this season among its mem-
bers, while its prospects of getting away with the club
supremacy are not by any means bad.

On Monday night Sydney Centennial Hall
was packed for the anti-Federal meeting—plat-
form, galleries, and floor. At the doors late
comers climbed on the shoulders of those in front,
and cursed loudly at not being able to get in to
see the fun. When G. Republican Dibbs stood up
and began to speak this writer felt sorry for the
old man—he looked so old, so tired, and so hun-
gry for bed. He wore a little round cap on the
back of his head, and, although he expanded his
onoe-noble chest to its uttermost, his voice could
not be heard half-way down the northern gallery.
For the first five minutes there was perfect silence
and every promise of a model meeting. Then an
awful voice yelled, “What about Montgomery's
widow?” At 8.20 the crowd was howling
for John Norton, and that erratic fire-eater
waved his pocket-handkerchief at them and
made cabalistic signs. This amused some
and angered others, who told John to put
his nose-rag in his pocket. By 8.25 Dibbs was not
speaking as far as the audience was concerned ; he
was simply gesticulating, expanding his chest,
bending himself double, and training the point of
his beard on various parts of the hall. Suddenly,
without warning, he sat down. Then Norton
arose, and there was a tremendous demonstration.
He opened by pouring vitriol upon some indi-
vidual for “interrupting all the evening.” This
was unfair, as half the hall had been interrupting.
Thence for a while, right down to the man who
wanted to know about Montgomery’s widow,
everybody maintained sullen silence. Norton felt
uncomfortable ; he was like the good little boy
who, in company with a lot of very low
mates, suddenly meets his maiden church-going
aunt, just as the dog-fight is starting. He
began to tell the audience that he was in good
company, that Dibbs was not half a bad chap,
he’d done a lot of good at different times, stopping
land sales when somebody was selling public estate
at the rate of £2,000,000 per annum. And he’d
saved the credit of all Australia at Bank-Smash
time. Oh, yes ! his new pal George was not too
bad. As for Dr. M‘Laurin (hoots, howls, tramp
of mastodons,)—“ callous somethings like Reid
had sneered at him for his care of the fatherless
and the widow, but it was the grandest”—and
then even John’s awful clang was swallowed up
in tumult. Dr. M‘Laurin was Chancellor of the
University, and how many of them were poor,
toiling working-men with sons, good sons
that they hoped to see in the University?
What John was driving at was not
very clear, and as he didn’t stop to explain
it, it must remain a mystery, but it looked
very like a “ smooge.” When John spoke of the
Council, a man asked him why he couldn’t trust
the people to squelch the bill if it was unfit for
consumption ? and John couldn’t answer him ; he
ignored him. Thenceforward his speech, as far
as it could be heard and understood, wild
abuse of Melbourne and appeals to the work-
ing men not to allow themselves to be cajoled
into a union in which a hide-bound, impregnable
central government would collect three times as
much money from them as it actually needed
and give it to the “lame ducks.” (Dibbs
had called the other provinces “lame ducks.”)
When Norton had grown so hoarse that he could
speak no more, a tall man in a black coat
got up and gibbered at the people. Miss
Rose Scott stood to say “a few words”
with a block of paper in her hand.
The audience grew restive. Miss Rose Scott
is not a good elocutionist, her style is sing-
song, and when it was seen that she was
bent on going right through the block of
MS. an intense feeling ran through the crowd
that something would break. The people didn’t
want to be rude to a lady, especially to' one who
looked so kindly, but they seemed to feel that
Miss Rose Scott must be stopped somehow.
They clapped their hands gently but firmly
and tramped softly with their feet, and made a
subdued roaring noise. But Miss Scott still held
on and placed sheet after sheet on the table till
her hands were empty. Dibbs rose up "and bent
himself double, held the candle in one hand and a
paper in the other, and the people on the plat-
form began to wave their handkerchiefs and
shout, and those in the body of the hall did like-
wise, and there was an awful uproar, and sud-
denly the hands went down and another lot went
up again, but not nearly so many, and John Nor-
ton bellowed something and waved his Butler cap,
and the audience howled, and cheered, and hooted,
and started to file out.

—a miserable lag-land like Tasmania, which hasn’t a
Soul to call its bwn—
(Fitzpatrick is a proud native bf N.S.W., thb

the very next sentence homes this complaint:

Objectionable terms of New South Wales. . . . New South
Wales is absolutely sneered at.
Then, all in the same column of Hansard :
N.S.W. is asked to go cap in hand to a lot of miserable,

The essence of Justice Hodges’ summing-
up in the Dungey-Bromley case was that there
was no evidence of “ a wicked mind ” in the act
of the accused. To demand evidence of “ a
wicked mind ” when crime is charged is good law
and good morality. But the phrase, “ a wicked
mind,” means an intention to do the evil charged.
Now why in cases of murder per misadventure is
not evidence of this primary intention as emphati-
cally demanded ?

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderfui influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing- cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and. immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
<< e xJ S sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
- n Mr - WG. lIEARNE.—Dear Sir,—l had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
. ' . x luiu a, IUI UJ lllt'dicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
j u fter sufferin ff fr °m asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great manv different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883,14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicinfe quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.

with the ominous jaw has again pushed himself into a
prominent position in the columns of the great dailies,
and is re-elevated to th» dignity of a social problem.
About eight years back the familiar “ stiff-rimmer and
the flowing “ bell-bots.” suddenly disappeared from Melb.
streets. The revolution was not simply sartorial, the
larrikin had really gone under, and he remained in a
comparative state of subjection for years. What in-
duced this unexpected subsidence is not obvious. It was
certainly not brought about by any extraordinary effort
on the part of the Law. That learned hass had done
nothing unusual. It seems reasonable to conclude that
the larrikin was, in fact, a victim of the hard times.
Certainly his decay was contemporaneous with the pass-
ing of the sensational speculator in building-lots, the
wild-cat financial society, and the predatory bank-director
who gave a tithe of his neighbor’s income to the Lord.
Yet it isn’t quite the same larrikin. The old stiff-rimmer
has not survived the depression, and bell-bots. are re-
tained only in a modified form. The rehabilitated larri-
kin of Carlton or Footscray wears either a peculiar little
round boxer with no rim worth mentioning, or a high-
crowned, black felt cady, such as is much affected by
jockeys. His coat is short and his trousers are light, and
only sufficiently belled to modify the outlines of his feet,
always a tender vanity with the dressy larrikin. About,
his neck he likes best a large, striped handkerchief—black
and white is most in favor now. This is donned with
artful carelessness and tucked back under the arms with-
out being crossed. The above is the “ leary one ” who
dresses the part. There is also another type who, whilst
instinctively preserving certain characteristic features, is
blandly indifferent to appearances. He is by far the
most dangerous of the suburban banditti, the first in
stoushing, the most vicious and most persistent in a
scrum ; butitisthe “bloke” proclaimed by his apparel who
falls into the hands of the police, and is gently admonished
by a merciful magistracy. His clothes give him away.
The woman element is singularly lacking at the larrikin
conversazione, and the peb’s customary public attitude
towards the sex is casual and contemptuous. But the
most marked characteristic of the push on its pitch is its
extraordinary lack of humor. The larrikin has his sets of
cxtch phrases and peculiar idioms, but he uses them per-
sistently without any sense of the ludicrous or absurd,
and his laugh—when he does laugh—is not wholesome.
There is no playfulness in the composition of _ Micky, or
Ginger, or Nipper, and none ever made an intentional
joke in the whole course of his street-corner career. He
cultivates an implacable expression, and horseplay is in-
compatible with the push’s reputation for slugging and
plugging and dull villainy. Sometimes you see an
exuberant “ bloke ” attempt a waltz on the footpath,
moving with the cold deliberation of a dancing bear, but
his movements excite no interest in the push bosom, and
the studied ferocity of the crowd is not impaired thereby.
It never lends itself to unseemly frivolity.
“ Gobung ” : Recently saw a rat leading a
blind mate by the ear, presumably skirmishing for
tucker. Sooled Thomas (family oat) on to them.
Leading rat ran, leaving his blind companion in
the lurch. Did Thomas go for blind rat? Not he.
Caught retreating rat first and squelched it; then
killed blind rat.

W. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir, —For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Salis,” and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing ‘ ‘ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O’REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY
Doveton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon, — August 21 st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY HOLTHOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

I suffered great agony With WEAK NERVES and

I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,

Statutory Declaration.
I, THOS, MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-

hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the NERVES, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried
several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail.
Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rass-

which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare COM-
PLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and although
this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since.

this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same
to be true.

"P CLARKE, Esq., a merchant, of Geelong, writes to
Mr. S. A. PALMER, agent-general for VITA-
DATIO, 45-47 Bourke-street, Melbourne, as follows :
“ Ryrie-street, Geelong, March 16,1899.
“I have suffered for years from that terrible disease
ECZEMA. I was persuaded (after considerable hesi-
tancy) by a friend of mine, who had heard of the
wonderful cures in New Zealand by Vitadatio, to give
‘Webber’s VITADATIO’ atrial. I sent to Melbourne
for six large bottles, and, when I had finished them,
thought I was cured, and discontinued its use, but the
trouble returned, and I thought * VITADATIO ’ is not a
cure for my trouble anyway. I explained my case to
Mr. Palmer, and he urged me to take some more ‘ VITA-
DATIO.’ I made a fresh start, took about another 12
bottles (large size), and am thankful to say I am
thoroughly cured, and have been so for fully eight
months, and think VITADATIO is a wonderful remedy
for blood diseases. I am 70 YEARS of AGE, and a
medicine that will cure a man at my time of life is
surely a wonderful discovery. I was speaking to a
gentleman—a friend —who had suffered from ‘ Piles ’
(Hemorrhoids) for over 14 years. He joyfully told me
he was quite cured after taking 12 large bottles of VITA-
DATIO, but he is unwilling his name should appear,
but said I was at liberty to refer any sufferer to him.
He is well known and highly respected in this town.
“ I am, yours sincerely, R. CLARKE, J.P.
ANOTHER CASE OF INTERNAL COMPLAINT.
SUFFERER FOR 13 YEARS TOTALLY PROSTRATED.
Mrs. COLEMAN, of Lee-street, North Carlton, suffer-
ing from Bladder and Kidney Trouble for many years,
stated, unable to move without the most intense agony,
but a course of VITADATIO has undoubtedly saved her
life and enabled her to get about —a thing that neither
she nor her friends ever expected her to have the hap-
piness of. Mrs. Coleman speaks in the highest terms
of the blessing she has received, and will only be too
glad to enumerate her case to any lady or gentleman
Mr. Palmer may choose to send. Her case is one of in-
terest both to the public and the medical profession, as
a proof of what VITADATIO can do. Call at the
VITADATIO INSTITUTE, and judge for yourself.

295 Victoria-street, West Melbourne.
I was living at 378 Napier-street, Fitzroy, and for a
considerable time had been ill off and on, but I was
taken seriously ill on the 17th December, 1898, and, on
one of the leading doctors of Fitzroy being called in, he
said that I was-in a terrible state with inflammation of
the liver and kidneys, and to add to my trouble a large
lump had formed, which he said was either a cancer or
a tumor, and that I was in such a state that I must be
operated on at once. A friend of mine, hearing this,
came to see me and advised me to try VITADATIO, and
I thank God that I did, for, after taking five bottles, I
became quite a new woman, the lump having entirely
disappeared, and I have not had any return of the pain
since. I will be most pleased to give any further in-
formation at my present address, and can give refer-
ences as to the miraculous cure effected from leading
business people, and the clergyman who kindly visited
me during my very severe illness.
i am, yours gratefully, E. BROWN.
11th March, 1899.
AN OBJECT LESSON,
Proving the value of the now renowned and famous
VITADATIO, which is accomplishing MARVELLOUS
and very WONDERFUL CURES wherever tried.
The present output has been at the rate of 3500
BOTTLES WEEKLY. That, multiplied by 52 weeks,
gives you an idea of the magnitude of the good that is
being done.
The DEMAND is DAILY INCREASING. Facts and
Figures are PROOFS INCONTROVERTIBLE.
The year’s returns is close on 200,000 bottles in Vic-
toria alone.
“ Be cheerful ; spend your life in returning thanks
that you are alive. Rejoice, be happy ; make as many
people happy as you can. Live well and live long';
you will never have another chance.”— Max o’Rei,l.

ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT'
Pleasant, Soothing, Cooling, Health-giving, Refreshing, and Invigorating.
NO HOUSEHOLD OR TRAVELLERS’ B4G SHOULD BE WITHOUT IT.
TN HOT OR FOREIGN CLIMATES ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT’ is
JL INVALUABLE. It is the BEST and SIMPLEST preparation for
regulating the action of the LIVER that has yet been discovered, and lelieves
the system of effete GOUTY, RHEUMATIC matter, the groundwork of
FEVERS and other diseases, which, if retained, poisons the blood, and pro-
duces the most disastrous consequences. It allays nervous excitement, and
restores the nervous system to its proper condition by NAIURAL MEANS, v
The effect of ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT’ upon any DISORDERED, SLEEPLESS
and FEVERISH condition is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact,
NATURE’S OWN REMEDY, and an UNSURPASSED ONE.

A Headache Cure should be
instantaneous, safe, certain,
and effective, however oftf u
it is used, and free from dan-

so-called headache cures are
dangerous, and ought not to
be used except under medical
advice. A headache cure, free
from every objection, is ob-
tainable, and known as
BISHOP’S
Citrate of Caffeine
It immediately cures the
worst headache, and dispels
all feelings of exhaustion and

THE OABE OF
Mr, Reginald Owen.
{From, the “ Liverpool Herald " August 6th.
1898.)
(by our special reporter).
Anyone arriving at Liverpool by train can-
not fail to observe, near the railway station
at the foot of the bridge that here spans
uhe river, the picturesque residence and
boat-houses of Mr. Reginald Owen, boat
proprietor and builder. There is not a man,
woman or child in the district but what
knows Mr. Owen. A reporter from the
Liverpool Herald office paid this gentleman
a visit.
“ I have come,” said the newspaper man,
‘‘ to learn all about your recovery and how
it was effected.”
“ Welcome,” replied Mr. Owen. “ I give
you a complete
History of IVIy Case.
*‘Some time ago I found myself getting
weak and unable to do even the light work
whieh my bus : ness demands. Often I
should be forced to sit down and take a
rest after being but a few minutes at work.
This puzzled me, for ordinarily I could do a
hard day’s work and not feel the least
fatigued afterwards ; but now all day long I
Felt languid and dissatisfied
with everything. Then, again, I found my
appetite gradually waning, till I didn’t
trouble about coming to my meals till I was
called. Then I would sit down, turn my
food over once or twice, perhaps eat a
mouthful or two, and then
Could eat no more."
" You wanted an appetiser.”
"‘So my people said, and I got two or
three bottles of stuff I saw advertised,
which was guaranteed to string a man to-
gether and make him eat. I remember I
took a couple of doses before dinner.”
** What result ? ”
Why, I couldn’t eat a mouthful. The
stuff completely turned me up, and I went
outside and threw the rest into (he river
there (pointing to George’s River). I slowly
got thin, and no wonder, as I was not
eating anything, and then, to make matters
worse, my nerves began to go wrong. I
couldn’t stand any strain whatever ; even
the trains that passed my home, to which
I had long been accustomed, worried me a
great deal.
My Energy was Gone.
If anyone came to see me on a matter that I
could make a profit of, I was afraid to see
them. I lost the money rather than under-
go the trial of an interview. As time went
©n my complaint obtained a deeper hold
upon me, and I lost my sleep. I used to be
awake and long for morning so that I could
get away from my bed, and when morning
came I felt
Too Weak and Miserable
to get up. My weakness became general,
and affected every portion of my body. I
got thinner and thinner. I had to throw
up my work altogether. I became terribly
irritable, and at length I got into a state
which I can only describe as general de-
bility.”
“ Did you feel any pain ?”
“ No, I did not. 1 should have been far
better pleased if I oouiri bsvelrested a good
ache somewhere. But here I was. with no
organic trouble the matter with tn» that I
could make —with nc apscial dicasj —
and yet falling away, th. jv.-gh, i s>"ppos*, a
Lack of Vital Force
in my nervous system.”
“ There must have been something wrong
Mr. Owen.”
“ Yes, I knew that, but it was verysubtle
and elusive. There must have been a cause
for my illness, but there were no par-
ticular signs by which we could tell the
nature of the disease* The doctors said
they could do nothing except recommend a
change of air and scene, and give me certain
rules as to living and diet. Their treatment
did me no good, and I could have once
showed you a goodly collection of
The Remedies that Failed.’*
“ You had a bad time ? ”
“Yes, and I looked bad, too. I was deeply
despondent. I didn’t know which way to
turn for assistance-. My nerves were shat-
tered and my physical strength was very
low, and it was only through reading a book
containing a case which in most details was
similar to mine that I am alive to tell you
the story of my sufferingsr. This book
described the effects of Clements Tonic.
If it cured him, why not me? Our cases
were alike. I first of all satisfied myself
that the report of
The Case was Genuine,
and then I sent for some of the remedy.”
“ What effect had it?”.
“ I could not perceive any immediate
change, but after a few doses I began to feel
better, I thought, and I suppose it supplied
my system with something that was missing!
for I began to shake off some of the des-
pondency and nervousness then with every
dose. A more
Hopeful feeling set in.
I got up and about, began to eat again, and
I needed no second call after my long period
of starvation. The dawn of every day saw
me better. I could sleep like a rock, and I
don’t believe a railway collision would have
awakened me. In time I put on the flesh
I had lost and obtained my usual robust and
healthy appearance. My recovery was so
perfect > that people who knew me were
astounded ; they evidently did not expect,
me to pull through.” Here Mr. Owenlaughed
heartily, and continued.-
“ They wouldn’t believe I was the same
man that a few weeks before
Was a Helpless Invalicf,
but Clements Tonic alone did it, and for it
to cure a man reduced in vitality as I was
is simply wonderful. I don't believe, after
my case, that there is any curable disease
a man can have but what Clements Tonic
will eradicate.

Dear Bulletin. —You sneer at the mili-
tary commander who ordered the body of the
Mahdi to be flung into the Nile, with the object
of knocking the stuffing out of the dervishes’
superstitious reverence for their previously un-
washed prophet. You also remark that the
Britain of old could have “ held its own ” against
badly-armed spearmen without committing “out-
rages on the dead,” but unless you wish to suggest
that General Kitchener and co. are physically
afraid of Arab fanaticism, your reference to. the
Britain that “ used to be ” has nothing to do with
the case. The Soudan trouble is a religious trou-
ble. As long as the dervishes are open to be
deluded by any masterful new Prophet who may
come along, there will always be a probability of
Britain having to slaughter the pious cranks right
and left. Of Britain’s ability to hold its own
against badly-arined spearmen there is no doubt;
then why quarrel with the musters of the situation
for wishing to maintain a bloodless ascendancy,
instead of a gory despotism ? Better to kill the
Mahdi legend than to slaughter the. fanatical
believers therein. The chucking of the Mahdi’s
corpse into the Nile may save thousands of lives
in the future, and in a region which is 2000 years
behind the times the outraging of a dead Mahdi
seems as politic as the Early Christian destruction
of pagan gods.—F.
[And if Britain got into a religious war with the
Catholic powers of Europe it might gain a point by dig-
ging up some dead Popes (assuming a British army to be
in possession of Rome) and throwing them into the
Tiber. But it wouldn’t dare to do it. The Soudan, as
“ F.” remarks, is 2000 years behind the time, so the
British went back for a moment to the savagery of 2000
years ago to be in keeping with the place. The throwing
of the Mahdi’s body into the Nile doesn’t necessarily
destroy the Mahdi legend. If his followers believe he is
in Heaven they will still believe it. If they believe he
was a saint, the outrage on his dust is no evidence to the
contrary—though it may convince them that the British
have nothing saintly about them. If they believe he will
rise again—well, he can rise out of the Nile as easily as
out of the earth. Also, if he does allegedly rise, the
British will have thrown away the only evidence that the
new man isn’t the old one arisen. Where would the
story about the Resurrection have been if the Pharisees
had kept a tight enough hold on the original body and
could have shown that it hadn’t risen ? Of course, if the
things that were done to the body of Christ had killed
Christianity, or if the knocking about of the dust of Peter
and Paul had destroyed the popular reverence for Peter
and Paul, or if the scattering of the ashes of the early
Protestants had killed Protestantism and proved to its
adherents that the holy Romans of the Inquisition days
were correct in their theories, or if even the murder of
Joe Smith had killed Mormonism, then there would be
some logic in the proceedings. But in view of the fact
that no sect was ever convinced of its error by having its
founder's body dug up and dragged around, the act looks
like senseless barbarism.—Ed. B.j

The Taming of Belinda.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Michael Tottles put up his sign on his
shop-window, and went on stitching and hammer-
ing saddles into shape, until one morning he died,
in a meek kind of way, in the arms of his weeping
wife. And then his son, born and christened for
the sake of the old sign, took up his father’s
needle and wax-end, whilst the poor old mother,
amidst her grief, thanked God on her knees for
the grace that had made a saddler of her son.
The business was a good one, and it lost nothing
by the old man’s death. The son was his father s
child in every respect, and Mickey Tottles, with
his meek, simple nature, was quite content to be
imposed upon by the customers who had imposed
upon his father before him.
Belinda Thompson stepped into his life one day.
She was a big, bouncing girl, with a dark, wicked
eye that fell upon poor Mickey like a sabre-stroke.
After that, his one ambition was to take her to
Sunday-school to read the Bible together, but
Belinda wouldn’t go. She asked him, instead,
how much he had in the bank, and all about it.
Mickey told her.
“ Ah, well,” she said, “ I think it will do. We
will go to church, instead.”
So they went, and returned man and wife, and
presently old Mrs. Tottles was observed, with tears
in her eyes, to tip-toe her way into her neighbor’s
house, and tell Mrs. Jackson, ’midst her grief, that
Mickey didn’t want her any more, and had put a
bad, wicked woman in her place.
Mickey, however, was misunderstood. He came
round to Mrs. Jackson’s, looking for his mother,
seeming sorely troubled. Finding her weeping,
he put his arms around her neck and tried to say,
“Mother, come home.” But his blue eyes filled,
and he fell to crying himself, just like any other
child might do. The Tottles had the reputation
of being soft-hearted.
Mickey brought his mother home at last. Be-
linda was upstairs ransacking her husband’s
boxes—an old-fashioned bonnet of Mrs. Tottles
upon her head.
* * m *
Twelve months of married life, and Mickey was
a father. His baby boy, the apple of his eye, was
to be baptised.
“We’ll call him Michael, of course,” said
Mickey, “and he shall have the old shop with
the old sign, and •”
“No, we won’t,” interrupted Belinda. “It’s
too vulgar.”
So the child was- christened Gregory Claude
Tottles. The old lady went into hysterics over
the name, and Mickey for the first time felt glad
his father was dead.
“After all,’’snapped Belinda, “ it don’t matter
much to you what we call him. You’ll know why
in a week.”
Mickey waited patiently for the end of that
week. It canm, and the news was all over the
town that Mrs. Tottles had cleared out with Alec.
Chicksee. They had travelled to Sydney, rumor
said, as man and wife.
For a week Mickey went silly. His faithless
wife had taken the baby with her, and Mickey’s
love for that child was a terrible thing. And,
besides, the spell of those black eyes was over him
still. Shei was the mother of his child.
“ Good-bye, mother,” he said, at the end of the
“ What, Mickey - ' •
“ I’m a-goin’ to look for them. I’m a-goin' to
Sydney. I can’t live without them. I’m a-goin’
to fetch them home, mother. Good-bye.”
He was gone. This time, however, Mrs. Tottles
didn’t tip toe her way into Mrs. Jackson’s house.
She merely stood where he had left her, staring at
the door through which he had gone. And half-
an-hour afterwards, for the first time in the
memory of Mrs. Jackson, she was heard to sing a
joyful stave, as out in the yard she splintered the
firewood with fierce blows of the axe. , ■
* * * * >c
Alec. Chicksee and the woman he was living
with both woke at the striking of a match in
their bedroom, and gazed in alarm at the intruder,
who, having lit the gas, stood with a pistol pointed
dead at the man’s head.
“Heavens, it’s Mickey!” cried the woman.
“ Mickey, please, Mickey, don’t shoot.”
“Send that man away,” said Michael Tottles.
Alec. Chicksee had often been told his act would
send the saddler mad. And a madman with
firearms is dangerous. He obeyed with alac-
rity, and dressed and went out of the roofh,
without a word, in shivering fear of the man he
had wronged.
“Now, Belinda, I am going to wait here till
morning.” > ?
And he did, with the light burning all the
time. There was a fierce determination in his
manner, and a gleam in his eyes the woman had 1
never seen before. She was cowed, and the man
she had bullied and betrayed she feared at last.
In the daylight Mickey dressed the baby him-
self, and told his wife to get ready.
“ What for ? ” she asked.
“ We are all going home to mother again,” he )
said. “ Hurry, for the boat will leave soon.”
“Home!” cried the woman, with the old-time
scorn in her voice, “ with you—never ! ”
“ Then we will die here together—the three of
us.”
The woman shuddered.
“No, no ; not that—not that!” <
“ Then home. Hurry ! ”
* * • •
It was a very quiet party that got out of the
cab that drew up outside the saddler’s shop.
Mickey, carrying the baby, went in first; his wife '
followed.
“ Mother, Belinda has come home again.”
The old woman said nothing, but stood, with
arms folded, gazing bitterly at her son’s wife,
who quailed beneath the look.
“Mother, why don’t you speak? Baby has
come home again.”
Her eyes softened. But her arms were still
folded.
“It is her child,” she said.
“No, no, mother ;it is our child boy.”
Belinda grew agitated. A look of terror came
into her eyes, and for a moment she gazed wildly
around. Then, with a passionate outburst of
tears, she threw herself at the other woman’s feet,
and cried—
“ Forgive me—forgive me; but the child is :
not ”
“ Stop ! in God’s name, stop !” the elder woman
interrupted, throwing her hand over Belinda’s
mouth ; “ or I will kill you ! ”
Mickey did not understand.
“No, no, mother ; she only wants to say the
child is not hers—but ours. Baby belongs to both
of us, and to you, too, mother. Forgive her.”
“ I forgive her, then.”
And Mickey took the child up to his room, to
fondle it, and to cry over it.
“ Yes, I forgive you,” she continued, when they
were alone, “ but you know at what price. Be
careful what you say in your sleep, or else ! ”
But Mickey was back again, insisting that his
mother should kiss his wife.
“ For baby’s 9ake, ” he said.
The women kissed.

The Death Sentence.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His Honor, richly garbed in a spacious robe, the
voluminous folds of which lent a statuesque dig-
nity to his short and fleshy figure, leaned forward
in his place on the bench under its richly-carven
canopy. His eyes were riveted upon the prisoner
cowering in the dock clinging to its spiked bars.
Lawyers in the court, listening with keen, pro-
fessional interest, but without a human heart-
throb, said the Judge had never before been so
eloquent, so searching, so touching as in his sum-
ming-up that day, and his Honor’s penchant for
improving the occasion had given a proverb to the
people. It was said his Honor should have been a
parson. One barrister declared that he never
heard the Judge deliver a judgment without feel-
ing an almost irresistible desire to go round with
the hat.
The jury had come in with its verdict—
“ Guilty! ” and now His Honor, who had never
taken his eyes from the face of the wretch in the
dock, was talking again, almost beside himself
with emotion. The lawyers whispered and won-
dered, and .the cold pressmen recorded in neat,
carefully-rounded phrases the opinion that the
duties of a criminal-court Judge must be an abid-
ing torture to a man of such a highly-strung and
extremely sensitive organism as Judge Blinco.
But none knew that the Judge, gazing intently
into the coarse, brutal, lowering face in the dock,
had seen grow in it a vivid and terrifying likeness
to himself, and, as he gazed, the likeness became
more accurate in form, and line, and shade. The
Judge remembered the promptings of his hot
youth, ere money and matrimony won him back
to the path of respectability and preferment ; and
horror gripped his soul with an icy clamp as the
last dread word fell from his blue lips, and that
man, who was himself, was condemned to death.
As the word was spoken the Judge was seen to
catch at his side with both hands and fall back in
his chair. He was helped from the Bench and
taken home in a cab, and for weeks he lay upon
his bed, silent and dreadful, intent on some hor-
rible thing of which the watchers had no cogni-
sance, waiting with ghastly-faced, stupid terror
that drove his wife shrieking from his bedside,
and made men think of a lost soul at the gate of
Hell.
At five minutes past ten one beautiful Spring
morning, the slouching hangman at the city prison
pulled the gallows-bolt, and—-
The Judge far away flung himself forward in hia
bed, remained rigid for a moment, tearing at hia
neck with hungry fingers, his eyes starting from
his head, his mouth gaping blackly. Then he
died.
E.D.
An English schoolboy’s essay on Lord
Kitchener:—
Lord Kitchener ov Surder is a Irish man, but hia
parents lived in Suffolk when he was born. He went to
Egipt to find Gordon corps. Vengens, vengens he cried
and he had so much vengens that he killed all the kar-
tooms and made a frenchman <ro home quickly, a war. of
terrible blood will now come with france and pretty soon
there will be no french maps in school as no country will
be left, the ladies all love Kitchener and my mother says
she wishes she could get hold of him it is nice to be brave
as you can go to feasts and eat awful like Kitchener.


Printed that during the recent heat-wave
out-back a tired parson droning to a tireder con-
gregation abruptly shut up at half-time with the
observation : “We will now conclude this service;
you can sleep more comfortably at home than
here.”
Sir Evelyn Oakeley, late chief inspector of
schools in England, and lately on a visit to Aus-
tralia, throws interesting sidelights on the struggle
for existence in London. “ The enormous increase
of the population requires one new school for 1000
children to be opened every month throughout the
year. The percentage of school-children who are
upwards of 12 years old is very small. The Edu-
cation Department would be glad to increase the
short school-life, but parents are opposed to any
extension, because they require the wages which a
child of 12 or 13 can pick up.”
When Melbourne was sick of the boom,
the young man was told to go on the land, and
there was much gush about the grand prospects
of scent-farining ; also Govt, was induced to show
how the quite-superior industry should proceed.
And it has proceeded so fast that last year the ex-
penses were <£464 and the receipts <£4s; also,
there is no hope for the future, for everything in
connection with the farm is declared to be as bad
as bad can be. So Turner closes the purse with a
snap ; and Melb. has once more to be content with
the Yarra as a national scent-bottle.

Easter at Moore Park, Sydney, promises to eclipse

Autumn Medicine.
\
Change of Season often affects the health, more or less perceptibly Prudent persons take
“ Spring medicine ; but Autumn medicine is just as needful. The effect of hot summer
weather on the blood makes itself felt, now that the weather is changing; you feel bilious,
dyspeptic, and tired; and there may be pimples or an eruption on the skin ; the damp nights
bring little twinges of rheumatism or neuralgia, that give warning of the winter that is coming.
If you want to be brisk and active, well set-up for the winter, it is NOW that you should build
up the blood and give the nerves a little tonic.
Dr- Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People
will make you strong, and stave off the rheumatic pains for the winter, if you take them NOW.
FOE EXAMPLE-
Mr. Arthur Andrew Belfitt, of No. 4 Globe-street, Circular Quay, says: “I am in excellent
health now, although a few months ago I was suffering from indigestion. Although I was very careful
V.
over what I ate and drank, and took what I thought was suit-
able medicine, I got worse daily, I lost my appetite, and I con-
tinually had an unpleasant taste in my mouth, especially on
getting up in the mornings. I slept poorly, and at odd
occasions black specks would come before my eyes so that I
could hardly see. At times I suffered from bad headaches,
and I was very, often sick, and my complexion was yellow and.
unhealthy-looking. I became so weak that I had to entirely
give up my work as a wool-ganger. I tried many of the medi-
cines advertised to cure indigestion, but was disgusted with
them all, as they did me no good. Then a friend told me to-
try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. He said they’d
cured him, and he gave me a few pills that he had with him.
These pills seemed to have a decidedly good effect, so I then
bought some, and started to take them regularly. In a very
short time there was a wonderful change for the better. I
began to eat my food again with appetite, and digest it pro-
perly, too. I could positively feel the pills doing me good. I
soon put on my lost flesh and regained my strength, and in less
than two months was completely restored to health.
That’s how Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured me, and I shall
always recommend them.”
i,-.. vVilliiun.-' I’.iil< Fills have positively cured thousands of cases of indigestion, sleeplessness,
eczema, skin complaints, biliousness, liver and kidney troubles, ladies’ ailments, lung and chest affec-
tions, measles, rheumatism, neuralgia, partial paralysis, locomotor ataxia, St. Vitus’ dance, nervous
headache, nervous prostration, and the after-effects of influenza, dengue, typhoid, and scarlet fevers,

The Sliprails and the Spur.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The colors of the setting sun
Withdrew across the Western land—
He raised the sliprails, one by one,
And shot them home with trembling hand ;
Her brown hands clung—her face grew pale—
Ah ! quivering chin and eyes that brim !
One quick, fierce kiss across the rail,
And, “Good-bye, Mary ! ” “ Good-bye, Jim !”
Oh ! he rides hard to race the pain
. Who rides from love, ivho rides from home ;
But he rides slowly home ai/ain
Whose heart has learnt to love and roam.
A hand upon the horse’s mane,
And one foot in the stirrups set,
And, stooping back to kiss again,
With “Good-bye, Mary ! don’t you fret !
When I come back ” —he laughed for her—
“ We do not know how soon ’twill be ;
I’ll whistle as I round the ‘ spur ’ —
You let the sliprails down for me.”
She gasped for sudden loss of hope,
As, with a backward wave to her,
He cantered down the grassy slope
And swiftly round the dark’ning spur.
Black-pencilled panels standing high,
And darkness fading into stars,
And blurring fast against the sky,
A faint white form beside the bars.
And often at the set of sun,
In winter bleak and summer brown,
She’d steal across the little run,
And shyly let the sliprails down.
And listen there when darkness shut
The. nearer spur in silence deep ;
And when they called her from the hut
Steal home and cry herself to sleep.
A great white gate where sliprails were,
A brick house ’lieath the mountain brow,
The “ mad girl ” buried by the spur
So long ago, forgotten now.
And he rides hard to dull the pain
Who rides from one that loves him best ;
And he rides slowly back ayain
Whose restless heart must rove for rest.
HENRY LAWSON.
From Cold Storage :
If the shipper of kangaroo-tails were to see the exces-
sively clean and attractive methods adopted by the
Americans in sending their smaller portions of pigs and
cattle to London for sale in Smithfield Market, he would
realise the enormous advantage thov had over himself
The kidneys, tails, loins of pork, tongues, &c., are care-
fully packed in most scrupulously clean boxes, and the
nice white cloths that accompany or surround these
ai tides make them look as nice and clean as a piece of
fresh beef on one’s own kitchen table. It is this tempt-
ing, cleanly mode of putting its food-products before the
British public that has caused America to have so domi-
nant a position in our markets.
“Tripang.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of course Nangethe promised Ruma he would not
speak- Roberts would never learn of his wife’s
infidelity—and, of course, he went down to the
beach when the boats returned and told all. Who
was this half-caste, this woman, that she should
deceive a white man—a man who had steered a
boat clear of the reefs in the teeth of a cyclone!
Lifu men worship good boatmen —they are born
sailors themselves.
“Boss, the‘copra man ’ came while you were
in the shallows—l saw him.” Roberts was stag-
gered. He had bought the girl from a recruiter,
who was afraid to take her to Maryborough, when
she was a youngster, and she had always lived
with him—lately as his wife. Proud of her con-
nection with a white man, she regarded the natives
with disdain, and all went well until Wilson came
along.
“ Curse him ! Only two months on the island,
and he’s beaten me.” The trader’s hand wandered
round to the revolver-butt.
“Shoot it?” questioned Nangethe, compla-
cently.
“No,” answered Roberts, slowly, “the Danc-
ing Water will be here in a day or so—l’ll wait.”
He turned to his men, and cried, savagely,
“ Damn yon, hurry up ; light the fires and throw
in the slugs ! ”
Ruma greeted him cheerfully and confidently at
the door. “ I can see you had no luck; you look
so angry.”
Roberts brushed past her. “ Quick with my
dinner, or those fools will overcook the slugs.”
Humming to herself a native air, the girl flew
round, and in a few minutes the trader was down
at the boilers again.
Wilson strolled over afterwards and stood
watching the men slitting tlie beche-de mer:.
“Look here, Roberts ; if the Dancing Water
brings word that copra is down again, I reckon
I’ll chuck over the cocoanuts and take to tripang.
I’ve got one boiler, and you can lend me another.”
“ Yes, you can’t beat working, for the Chows—
‘Hollythurries,’ as a doctor-cove in the Straits-
used to call them, pay best,” answered Roberts,
gaily.
“ I don't know much about collecting them,”'
said Wilson, doubtfully.
“ Neither do I, except that you can pick them
up off the reefs, spear them, in the shallows, and
dive for them in deep, water. You send them to-
China to be sorted.”
“ I’ve got no divers.”
“ What rot! I brought my two- Malays and!
some Lifu men when I started,, but the natives-
are learning, and! now that the women come down
to the beach, and: cheer the pluckiest and luckiest
divers, all the boys on the island, want to jpin in.”
“ But the sharks *”
“ That’s, their risk,, and! they take it, for the
girls hoot, the men who work the reefs and.
shallows., i’ve only lost three mem”
“ Well,, I’ll see.”
Tjhp-boat from, the recruiting-vessel called! next
day, and* left a few “ returns ” and a note for
Wilson. Copra was down thirty shillings.
“It’s got to be slugs or starvation—the copra
won’t pay its freight. I’ll come to the beach to-
day and look on.”
All right there’s enough for both of us.
You d better fix up your boilers and smoke-shed
straight away.”
When the boats had gone out Wilson went over
to Ruma.
, Dome to the beach: I want to watch them
slugging, and, anyway, that Lifu man is hang-
ing about here, and he is not to be trusted.”
Ruma agreed ; she had heard the women in the
village talking of the divers, but had been too
proud to join the audience.
The circle of onlookers was almost hidden in a
shower of shell sand with which the maidens were
pelting the timid youths who, afraid to dive, were
wading near the shore. When they came in with
their baskets full the air was filled with cries of
4 Coward ! ” “ Stupid ! ” —and more sand. Then
attention was fixed on the boats. Tripang fishing
was still a novelty—a sensational novelty, now
that their own fathers and brothers shared in it ;
therefore the women loved it.
Ruma sat a little apart and watched the per-
formance. She saw the boat gliding along, and
the men peering over the side; then it stopped,
and a man dived into the water. Coming to the
surface he lifted his hands and displayed his
catch. A yell of joy burst from the women as he
clambered into the boat again.
Time after time the same thing was repeated,
except that in deep water the men in the boat
splashed their paddles to frighten the sharks while
their companion dived.
Wilson began to tire and said, “ Come home
now, Ruma.”
She did not answer, but with wide-open eyes
was staring at the fishermen. Just then one of
the Malays, after a long dive, came up with his
arms full. Ruma was conquered, and springing
to her feet joined the yelling crowd. She was
mad with excitement and her plaudits rang out
above the others.
“Bhe is still a savage,’’ muttered Wilson, walk-
ing away, for the girl no longer took any notice of
him.
He came down when the fires were lighted.
“ Those fellows are good divers.”
“Yes—if they didn’t make such a damned fuss
about it. But it’s new to them yet,” answered
Roberts.
“ I’ll go out in your boat to-morrow.”
“ If you like.”
* * » *
“Are you going to dive?” whispered Ruma,
excitedly, as Wilson passed her on his way to the
beach.
“No.”
She was evidently disappointed, and turned
away—rather contemptuously, Wilson thought.
“ Come along,” called Roberts.
Wilson took his seat in the stern, and soon
becoming infected with the prevailing excitement
—as great in the boats as on shore —he forgot for
a time his sweetheart’s perverseness. Yet her
voice could be heard, less and less distinctly, as
Roberts steered into deeper water, keeping a
course inside the reef.
Wilson gazed lazily over the side, admiring,
through the clear water, the bright colors of the
living corals, broken every now and then by a
patch of white sand. It was on these patches the
black bodies of the slugs were seen.
Suddenly he cried out, “ There’s one—over 2ft.
long, I’ll swear. Who’s going for it ? ”
“ No ! No ! ” screamed the natives. “ Look —
the ‘ Moving Pillar ! ”
In a line with them, and near at hand, a tall
rock rose from the reef. A native legend told
how it was transferred from an inland mountai
by Bokor, whose spirit, in the form of a snar ,
still haunted it, and no line must be dropped, n
arrow shot at fish, within the radius of its longes
shadow.
“ What about the stone, Roberts ? ”
“ Nothing—a silly superstition. Here’s a chance
to distinguish yourself—see the women ? ”
Wilson looked across, and saw that all trie
women had run to the water’s edge, Ruma in
front.
“ What ? Risk my life for a slug ? ”
“ No—for a woman’s favor.”
Wilson smiled at the man’s ignorance.
“ It’s worth while. Steady the boat, and splash
when I give the word.”
He stood up in the stern, and the natives, with
trembling hands, lifted their paddles —it was
Bokor’s water around them and they feared to
strike it.
“Are you ready?” asked Roberts, feeling at
his belt.
Wilson looked again towards the shore, and
answered :
“ Right ! Splash ! ”
“Don’t!” roared Roberts, raising his hand.
The revolver confirmed their hesitation, and the
paddles remained aloft.
The yams were bigger than ever the next
season, and the natives knew that Bokor had ac-
cepted the sacrifice.

“ I have used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in my family for years with the most satis-
factory results.
“ During the warm, debilitating days of summer it acts as a tonic and seems
to build up the system and restore the appetite.
“ I have always given it to my children, whose photograph I send you with
this letter, for any disorder of the blood, and, in fact, for all diseases peculiar
to children.
“I have found it greatly improved their health by getting at the root of the
disorder quicker than any other preparation.”
These are the children of Mr. and Mrs. Morrall W. Curran, of Bowen Hills,
Brisbane, Queensland. Mr. Curran sends us this strong testimonial. It shows
again why the people have named Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
The old and young alike are cured with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, for it is a family
medicine. Give a few doses to the children anytime they have indigestion,
sleeplessness, loss of appetite, headache, or general weakness. If they are pale
and thin, or have any rashes or pimples, they certainly need it. If you wish
the cure to be prompt, and if you wish it to last, be sure and use “ Ayer’s.”
There is nothing “Just as Good.”
