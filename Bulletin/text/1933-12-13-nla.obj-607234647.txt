ADVERTISERS!—
When you advertise you do not consider the
money involved as a speculation. You treat
this expenditure as an investment and expect
a reasonable return on your outlay.
FOR THREE GENERATIONS
“The Age’’ has exerted an influence in the
affairs and development of Victoria. Its
present powerful position has been gained by
its literary worth, which appeals to an intelli-
gent public, and by its accurate and complete
news service. These factors, having a direct
bearing on its value as an advertising medium,
cannot be disregarded by the advertiser look-
ing for the best INVESTMENT for his adver-
tising expenditure.

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New, Zealander that even in times of
economic, stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns,
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective find forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

The English Short Story
With very few exceptions the best Eng-
lish short stories are, to use an Irishism,
long stories. Of course, there have been
hundreds of imitators of O. Henry
and Maupassant, but the genius of the
race doesn’t run naturally to tabloid
romances which end with a bang inside
a thousand words or so. „ From Chaucer
onwards English writers have been
chiefly interested in character and in
class differences, and they have preferred
to take their time, digress, indulge in all
sorts of moral and other reflections. A
new book of short stories by Somerset
Maugham and some stories which have
appeared between 1837 and 1933 in
“Blackwoods” are just out, and the re-
semblances are striking. The same
leisureliness—-there are tales in both
books which run to over 15,000
words—the same preoccupation with
fine class shades, as expressed in clothes
and accents ; the same tendency to end
on anti-climaxes. They are English.
Jungle Scandals
In A h King (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.) Mr.
Maugham returns to Malaya and melo-
drama. When, as in “The First Person
Singular,” he writes about the West he is
obviously describing societies he has ob-
served long and closely, and he has the
penetrating and merciless eye of a hawk ;
when he writes of the East he often
seems to be inventing, and he doesn’t
invent well. To believe most of these
stories it is necessary to assume that the
residents of the F.M.S., if not exactly
imbeciles, are far less intelligent than,
say, English villagers. Consider “Foot-
prints in the Jungle.”
The story of the Cartrights is told by
Major Gaze, head of the police in Tanah
Merah.
Twenty years ago Bronson invited
Cartright to stay on his plantation, Cart-
right having been ruined in a rubber
slump. A year passed, and Cartright was
still there. The doctor’s wife once asked
Mrs. Bronson if she didn’t mind having
a stranger in the house, but was re-
assured. Mrs. Bronson was expecting a
child at the time. Some of her Women
friends knew, but, to, the surprise of those
who were aware of Bronson’s fondness
for children, she insisted on hiding the
glad news from him.
And now Bronson is murdered ; shot
from behind as he is bicycling along a
jungle path.
Cartright was in the club when the
news arrived, recuperating from an after-
noon’s shooting not far from the scene
of the tragedy. Major Gaze was worried
by his ghastly appearance, and suggested
brandy.
_ “It’s shaken me, you know,” said Cart-
right. “1.... I didn’t”.... he stopped as
though his mind was wandering; he was still
fearfully pale; he took out a packet of cigar-
ettes and struck a match, but his hand was
shaking so that he could hardly manage it.
“Yes. I’ll have a brandy.”
Seven months later Mrs. Bronson had
her baby, and shortly afterwards she and
Cartright were married.
Major Gaze tried hard to discover the
murderer, but failed. There were no
clues at all. It hurt his pride, but at last
he had to give the problem up in despair.
Meanwhile Mr. and Mrs. Cartright
settled down, and became popular local
figures. Then came evidence which, to
the Major’s stupefaction, proved that
Cartright had murdered Bronson. The
Major—an odd policeman, however you
take him —decided to say nothing. Bron-
son had been a decent fellow, but the
Cartrights were also decent. “If you’d
been a policeman as long as I have,” he
explains to Mr. Maugham, “you’d know
it’s not what people do that really mat-
ters ; it’s what they are.”
The reader is asked to believe, here,
that the prying natives had no suspicions
of the relations between Cartright and
Mrs. Bronson ; and that, even after the
marriage and the arrival of a girl with
Cartright’s dark eyes (her putative father
was red-haired),
neither this aston-
ishing policeman
nor any of his
white friends
thought of sug-
gesting a motive
for the murder!
The tragedy of the Hardys in “The
Book-bag” is founded on a similar ab-
surdity : that two people can hide an
irregular union in a small, gossip-loving
community for months, years, on end.
In detail these stories are highly
realistic—Mr. Maugham has a marvel-
lous faculty for making the reader hear
his characters’ voices, and see their faces,
gestures and clothes—but in the round
they are as unconvincing as bad movies.
Class Humor
Some may find it hard to enjoy the
full flavor of Humorous Tales from
“Blackwood” (William Blackwood ; 55.):
Upper middle-class English humor re-
sembles the family joke ; it is not always
suitable for export. “Punch” gags which
cause Mayfair to writhe in helpless
merriment often leave Long Island, not
to mention Bellevue Hill and Toorak,
stone cold. Walter de la Mare’s “The
Orgy” is typical “Punch,” which is to
say class, humor. He takes some 15,000
words to tell how young Philip Pirn
played a joke on his uncle, Colonel
Crompton Pirn. Not a new or very good
joke ; he ordered a number of expensive
articles to be delivered at his uncle’s
house in Grosvenor-square in revenge
for being cut off with a shilling. The
humor lies in the treatment; the thing
is a delicious (or revolting; it’s all a
question of the point of view) example
of West End whimsy. Young Philip is
waggish at the expense of a bowing shop-
walker on these lines:
“1 see you exhibit specimens of the tuber-
phone (and, by the way, I would suggest a
instead of ‘er’), the tubaphone, the clogbox and
the Bombadoo, iniquities at the same time
negroid and old-fashioned, but, though in a
recent visit to Budapest I found even the
charming little linden-laden shops—along, the
Uffel-gang, you know, not, Of course, a fash-
ionable part of the city—crammed with models
of the ‘Haba-Stein,’ a microtonic instrument
with five keyboards and Hindu effects, intended,
of course, for the polytonal decompositions
of”
And so on and on and on.
Most of the stories, however, have
solider plots than “The Orgy”; in fact, in
“The Pundrapore Residency,” which was
written by Alexander Allardyce in 1872,
yet reads as freshly as if it had been
written yesterday, the exciting story is the
thing, the joke no more than a tag at
the end.
“Good God, Caroline,” by Evelyne
Buxton, might have “been good enough
for ‘Punch,’ ” as the phrase goes, if it
had been about 18,000 Words shorter.
It contains an explosive General, doomed
to be shown up as a bit of a fool by his
charming wife; a low-comedy house
agent, and a neat little idea.
Perhaps the funniest of the 26 stories
in this big book, certainly the one that
should make the widest appeal, is “Father-
Tom and the Pope,” which was written
by Sir Samuel Ferguson 95 years go. It
monopolises 45 pages, and it is all pure
nonsense ; yet it remains comic to the
end.

One More Gulliver
People who believe that the motor-
car and the aeroplane have killed the
Gullivers and Mandevilles should read
Freeman of Stamboul, by Bernard Free-
man (Gollancz ; 18s.). The old gentle-
man who wrote this autobiography died
in Melbourne recently while his book
was in the press. Nothing better has
been done of the kind since Sadeur wrote
“La Terre Australe connue” in 1676.
Freeman was a Turk and he travelled
the world most of his long life seeking
adventure. It seems to have been his
own private world. Chronology, natural
history, personality and history were all
his slaves. Fact does not daunt him.
When, for instance, he wants to point
out to General Gordon that a gate in Jeru-
salem still existent was known as the Eye
of the Needle in the days of Christ, it
does not matter to him that the walls of
Jerusalem were razed a few times in the
course of the centuries. When he wants

to he lives six weeks in a tree in cir-
cumstances of the wildest improbability.
But his Australian adventures will
appeal most to Australians. De Rouge-
mont was his camp mate. That gentle-
man once saved their lives by smelling a
bushfire two days before it arrived.
And when they came upon a 20ft.
carpet snake, De R.
seized a large bough, hit the snake a tre-
mendous blow, crushing its skull, and instantly
pinned its head to the ground with the fork or
the branch he had used as a club. The battle
was terrific. As the snake lashed out its twenty-
foot right and left, struggling to free its head
and strike, De Rougemont leaped lightly from
side to side.
He would need to, as anybody at the
Zoo could have told the author. It
would be like having a stockwhip as thick
as a man’s thigh cracked about one’s ears.
The author confuses the ceratodus,
the lung fish which is found in a few
middle Queensland rivers, with the tree-
climbing mangrove fish of Cape York.
He was in Brisbane with Jack London
during the great flood of 1896 (which
took place in ’93), and Jack London,
“who was in the harbor with his yacht
at the time,” told him the ancient story
about the man who floated down the
river accompanied by his son on a piano.
As London was then a very busy man,
being in Alaska as well as in Brisbane,
which he never consciously visited till
1908, when he came over for the Burns-
Johnson fight, and as he didn’t own a
yacht, being just about out of knicker-
bockers, he may be pardoned his inanity.
Stevenson, of course, Mr. Freeman
knew well. They were “dead broke”
together in San Francisco. They had
this conversation:
“Yes,” I said, “I’ve known what it is to be
dead broke in Sydney, too; and I’ve slept out
in the Domain.”
“Why,” he said, laughing, “so have I. They
garrotted a man when I was there.”
The nearest R.L.S. got to sleeping in the
Domain was at the Union Club and the
old Oxford, then Sydney’s most fashion-
able pub.
There are yards of nonsense like that,
but it is an amusing book. Even Sir
Harry Johnston, who sent one of his
heroes, in the early nineteen hundreds,
on a desperate expedition to the wilds of
the south Queensland border country, and
who made the heroine of one of his
Australian novels own a country house
at Long Bay, could not have done better
or proved more diverting.
M. H. E.
Academic Art
I began my career as a painter in a
Government-supported school in an Aus-
tralian city. For six months I drew char-
coal studies of antique busts in line.
Then my teacher, having exhausted the
resources of his academy, suggested that
I should do a joke block for The Bulle-
tin. I wanted to be a painter, so I left.
In another capital I moved higher up
into another subsidised State institution,
supervised by a gentleman with diplomas
galore. He made me draw in char-
coal from skulls, skeletons and casts of
Greek statuary. I remember one cast
in which one half of the body had had
the skin removed so that one could study
the nerve system, muscular structure and
bits of the skeleton. From him I also
learnt the rules of composition—U-form,
diagonal, diagonal with U-form and the
like —which, I was told, had been laid
down once for all by the giants of the
past. After a year of this I was no nearer
understanding the problems of the painter
than when I started.
Then I removed to another city and
applied for admission to a noted private
academy, ruled over by a painter who,
having lived abroad, was said to have
something new to teach. He was a man
of intense enthusiasm, a benevolent
tyrant with real sincerity and consider-
able wit. I was completely under his
domination and firmly believed I was
on the right road. He set me for six
months drawing an aboriginal skull, and
told me that I could spend my whole life
drawing it and still have something to
learn.
After the six months I was allowed
into the life class, where I spent 18
months drawing, still in charcoal, from
the nude. Teacher suggested that I
should study a book on “artistic
anatomy” ; and I learned all about flexors
and extensors, tibias and fibulas. He in-
structed me in the laws of rhythm and
color harmony. At the end of my tuition
I knew no more about painting than
before I began.
A long time after this I met a painter
who had gone through the same mill,
thrown it up in disgust and proceeded to
worry things out for himself. He had
made the surprising discovery that objects
in Nature are not white spaces surrounded
by black lines, and had discarded the de-
lusion that to know what is inside an
object tells you anything about what the
outside looks like. He told me that
Nature presents itself to the eye as collec-
tions of color patches of various shapes
and degrees of tone, and in no other way.
The job of the painter was to define the
correct relationships between these color
patches, and that was all. Compared with
the complicated jargon I had learnt in
the schools this doctrine seemed banal
in its simplicity. I discovered, however,
that it was the doctrine of every supreme
artist of the past.
I have pondered long and hard the
problem why the false doctrines of the
academies persist generation after genera-
tion, despite the fact that they invariably
produce the same bad results and that
their falseness is perpetually being
demonstrated anew by the great painters
who, like Manet, Whistler, Constable
and Corot, succeeded in throwing them
off. I reason it out more or less in this
way.
Academic art is a matter of rules and
regulations. They have been handed
down by previous academicians who got
them from academicians who went
before. It is easier to learn rules and
regulations than to think for oneself;
also safer and more respectable. Conse-
quently, the man who makes a good
academician belongs to a particular type.
He is lazy-minded, timid and gregarious ;
at the same time, dogmatic and reac-
tionary ; he regards innovations as dan-
gerous and he wants to make a career
of art.
Since the public knows nothing about
these things and cares nothing, but has a
profound belief in authority, the
academic teacher is sure of a job. The
things he teaches his students also pay
them to learn, because the public will
always buy the conventional thing,
rather than something which, being
original, it does not understand.
So the academic teacher is impreg-
nable. He can talk any nonsense he likes
so long as it is orthodox nonsense ; and,
if it is challenged, he has only to cry
“Bolshevik!” for his critics to be dis-
comfited. And he will always appear to
be a success, while his critics will appear
to be failures, because the measure of
success is cash and the approval of the
multitude.
Have I any remedy? None at all. My
own experience shows that the young
student, having no capacity to judge for
himself, either meets a good teacher or
a bad teacher. It is a matter of pure luck.
F. S.
Kipling
Read now, after a third of a century,
“Kim” is as fresh and vivid, and as sub-
stantial, as the best stories in our tongue.
It is the mind and spirit of the larrikin-
mystic boy ; it is India and the sumptuous
indolence and speed of India ; it is subtle
and yet never thin or “artistic” ; it is
youth and age, cunning and deep
charity ; and laughter, full and exuberant,
the best of all.
If “Kim” is at the heart of Rudyard
Kipling’s vision, as literature “The Jungle
Book” is near to it, with the same ele-
mental freshness and the same direct sim-
plicity expressing depth and subtlety of
thought. These are great books in being
because the man had to write them —not
because he was a popular favorite, the
skilled artificer who knew so well the
taste of the man in the street.
Taking the situation of the simple-
hearted Tommy Atkins (commissioned or
otherwise) quartered in the black and tor-
tuous East, he made the most of it. To
him, born in Bombay, the tortuousness
was enough of an old story for literary
purposes ; Tommy Atkins was anyone’s
story ; the two juxtaposed and taken from
the “human” angle made excellent drama.
Defects in the drama’s qualities inevit-
ably appeared; the far-flung battle line
was vulgar and strident at times; often
a capable Empire journalist took the
place of the story-teller. A flashiness, the
flashiness that makes “The Light that
Failed” a failure and “The Story of the
Gadsbys” unconvincing, showed inter-
mittently, marring the body of the work.
But the proof of the pudding is in the
eating; as a story-teller Kipling was and
is a world-figure.
In style he is the true realist. In his
major work he thought himself deep
down into his pattern until he was Kim
or the protagonist of the story in his
mind. He saw its events with Kim’s
eyes, spoke with his speech, heard with
his ears ; hence the effect of complete
and intimate reality, whatever the nature
of the events. Hence also the vividness
of love and hate, shame, laughter, fear ;
it all comes direct and, as it were, first-
hand as part of .Kim’s ordinary every-
day experience. All his drama is achieved
by this good sincere method of taking
murder and laughter in the same stride;
even his horror is only realised after a
moment’s thought—it does not leap
screaming from the page, I mean. When
the young Kipling wrote with his whole
heart he was the supreme unconscious
craftsman.
A similar essence of reality makes and
mars his verse. If its qualities do not
always allow it to reach the level of
poetry, it has always a magnificence of
swinging rhythm, a vigor of phrasing and
“color” or an intimacy that makes it
real and true for the non-poetic reader.
Rudyard Kipling will be remembered
for long years for “Kim” and “The Jungle
Books,” and perhaps for some of the short
stories, though in a sense he outlived
their mode. It may be that “Stalky and
Co.” (which literarily is not good) will be
thumbed in school playrooms the long-
est of all. He would possibly prefer that
simple gift from posterity; its reality
would appeal to him.
HILARY LOFTING.
A Satchel of Books
Savages and Sinners, by John Maitland
(Macquarie Head Press; 65.), is an
account of somebody’s shameless adven-
tures in ex-German New Guinea. The
publishers say the book “is not for the
squeamish” but it “is all true.” Some-
body should send a copy to Canberra
to show it how effective its censorship is.
A ustralian A boriginal Place-names,
compiled by James R. Tyrrell (Simmons,
Ltd., Sydney; 2s. 6d.), records the
meanings of about 1500 Binghi place-
names from Adina (N.S.W.), meaning
“good,” to Yweagie (W.A.), meaning “a
miserable place.” It is also illustrated with
photos of diverse types of aboriginals
living in the eighties and nineties of
last century. Keith Kennedy, president
of the N.S.W. Anthropogical Society, has
written the foreword.
Letters of Byron, edited by R. G.
Howarth, and illustrated in photo-
gravure (J. M. Dent and Sons; 7s. 6d.).
This selection of nearly 300 letters covers
all the important phases of Byron’s life,
and brings us a closer understanding of
why he has been described as “with
Napoleon, one of the two most remark-
able figures of the nineteenth century.”
Throughout the long correspondence
flash those qualities of kindness and
courage, humor and sound commonsense
which endeared the man to his intimates,
and which are unrevealed in the romantic
and cynical genius of his poetry. The
letters are grouped successively. Those
written in boyhood and manhood link
early associations with friendships at
Cambridge. They pass onward to
illumine literary success, love affairs,
later friendships at home and abroad and
essays into politics, with a brilliant direct-
ness of style that lifts everyday figures
and events out of obscurity. Taking his
place among the greatest letter-writers,
Byron here reveals himself, blazing, alive
and informative, far better than any of
the modern, school of “novelist” his-
torians could have done. It is a com-
pelling book. Andre Maurois has written
a lucid and explanatory introduction.
A Protest Against the Maladministra-
tion of the Beneficent (sic) Public Trust
Known as the Felton Bequest, by H.
Walter Barnett, is a brochure printed in
Paris. In 1927 the writer brought out to
Melbourne a collection of French Pro-
vencal painters which was not very good.
Later he offered the National Gallery free
of charge a loan collection of French
modernists, and received a curt and cold
reply. The trustees, Mr. Barnett says,
have spent over half a million pounds on
works of art.
To an unprejudiced observer there appears
to have been as little policy of definite collec-
tion as a Paris chiffonier would attempt in
searching an ash-barrel for unconsidered trifles.
Unfortunately Mr. Barnett’s suggestions
for improvement are not impressive.
They are only opinions about new
fashions by another connoisseur. The
“moderns” are the fashion he fancies.
The Political Madhouse in America
and Nearer Home, by G. B. Shaw (Con-
stable ; Booklovers’ Bookshop, Melb.;
35.). This is the reprint of a lecture with
which the septuagenarian playwright
made the hair of the U.S. Academy of
Political Science curl. In trenchant style
he traverses the history of American in-
stitutions from the time when Uncle’s
industry appeared to be carrying all be-
fore it up to the present, when it is sit-
ting amongst the ruins, desperately won-
dering where its next job of work is to
come from. Shaw lays the blame on the
shoulders of ignorant politicians. Hav-
ing reduced his American audience
to a thoroughly low-spirited condition,
he cheers it up by remarking that if
they are in a bad box every other coun-
try is in a similarly unsavory receptacle.

THE FIFTH YEAR.
We are approaching the season of good-
will and entering upon the fifth year of
the depression. It will be no merry
Christmas for unemployed families, al-
though the breadwinner is promised a bit
more relief work here and there. Precise
information on the subject is strangely
lacking, but it seems clear that at least
500,000 Australians, men, women and
children, are on “sustenance.” And it is
doubtful whether the number of adults
who have regained regular jobs this year
exceeds the number of boys and girls
who are about to leave school with
nothing to look forward to.
Two bright features of the situation
are the steady increase in gold produc-
tion and the rise in the price of wool.
The wool industry is so immensely im-
portant that once the price reached a
profitable level the effects were felt
throughout Australia ; the general out-
look improved immediately. During the
worst four years they have ever experi-
enced, except when drought scourged
their runs, pastoralists let their wool go
at unpayable prices, and, although it
rained bounties on other interests, they—
their vote being scattered and inconsider-
able —received none. It is a vital matter
for Australia that sheepmen should be
placed in a position to improve their
properties and thus employ more labor,
and to cull and buy better stock ; but
this has not been done. The Common-
wealth Government has even retained
the tax imposed before the war to “break
up the big estates,” although one of its
own followers has furnished it with
proofs that the impost has worked out
m particular cases at 4d. per lb. of wool.
One possible danger is that the depres-
sion may have a second innings. Through
political action perhaps. It is conceiv-
able that the unemployed, the pensioners
and civil servants and the dissatisfied
country elements may turn against these
U.A.P. Governments, which are so com-
placent, so deficient in imagination, and
so feebly led at Canberra that Earle Page
has been moved to “appeal to the Minis-
try, for Heaven’s sake, to have a policy
and stick to it for at least half an hour”—
turn from them to the wild men who
want to “nationalise” banking and
“socialise” credit, and who claim that
they “do things.”
The Americans told themselves blithely
for three years that prosperity was just
around the corner. They awoke one
morning to find that the depression had
begun again in a worse form. They there-
upon kicked the Republicans out and
put the Democrats in ; and a Democratic
President is now engaged on a spectacular
programme of depreciating the dollar,
restricting production, increasing work
and reducing hours of labor, in the pro-
cess spending four hundred million dol-
lars on public works and budgeting for
a deficit of fifteen hundred million dol-
lars. Thus far no feature of the pro-
gramme has definitely fulfilled anticipa-
tions, and crop-curtailment estimates
have crashed. Cotton-growers were pre-
sented with 111 million dollars, the pro-
ceeds of what is called a processing tax,
and ordered to reduce their 1932 yield
of 13 million bales by upwards of four
million bales. With this result:
They reduced their acreages substantially, but
used Government funds to buy more fertiliser,
and devoted more time to the remaining crop.
The yield was 13,100,000 bales.
Australian Governments cannot follow
Washington in these adventures, nor
should they wish to try, but they can do
a great deal more for the unemployed
than they have done. Not by having
more sand shifted, more footpaths
made, more swimming-pools exca-
vated and the like, but by devot-
ing portion of the relief money to
the creation of small holdings in suitable
country places, and by putting private
employers in the way of greatly increas-
ing their staffs. Private enterprise, says
Kent Hughes, the Victorian Minister for
Sustenance, “has failed in the crisis to
provide for the unemployed”; but has it
been given a chance? Another Victorian
politician, R. C. D. Elliott, put a ques-
tion on the subject in the Senate the other
day and was answered thus:
The value of primary production and of
factory production in 1932-33 is estimated at
£314,600,000. Federal and State taxation
amounted to about £l4 4s. per head, or 30 p.c.
Minister Lawson made that admission,
and confessed also that “Governmental
indebtedness, Commonwealth and State,
has increased in the last three years
by £104,000,000.” Thirty per cent, of
the value of production taken in
taxes! A hundred and four millions bor-
rowed in three years, and half a million
Australians still on the dole! Is it not the
Government taxation and work-finding
policies that have failed? And would it
not be better even now to utilise the loan
money for tax- and interest-reduction,
exacting the condition that for every
pound remitted in this way at least a
pound’s worth of work or the equivalent
must be provided?
TWO TERRITORIES.
The fate of the New Guinea Territories
is in the melting-pot. At the end of
this month Hubert Murray will have
governed Papua for a quarter of a cen-
tury ; and at 72 he cannot reign much
longer. In the Mandate, General Grif-
fiths, who went to Namanula under pro-
test because apparently the Government
could find nobody else acceptable, will
retire at the end of next year.
There are rumors —strong ones, lurk-
ing in influential corners, too —that an
entire change of administrative method
will be made when Murray retires. It is
even said that a sort of Governor-
General will be inducted to manage the
joint affairs of the two dependencies,
and the name of Marr, the present
Minister, is mentioned. Mr. Marr has no
qualifications for such a job; he is
affable, and that is all. The rule with
these buffer States between us and East
Asia should be: “No politicians need
apply.” Firm, not suave, management is
needed to keep the northern marches of
Australia.
It is also suggested that Dr. Cilento
may be named Resident or Lieutenant-
Governor or Administrator or something
at Rabaul, and that some other gentle-
man may be sent to Moresby, both sub-
ordinate to the High Panjandrum in
general charge. Dr. Cilento made a
great impression on Canberra early this
year by an oration in which he com-
pared our sub-equatorial regions to the
“burning sands of Asia Minor,” where
most of the country happens to be a
higher and colder version of the Vale
of Canberra, with magnified Bogongs
and Kosciuskos in the distance.
It would, of course, delight the Liberian
delegate at Geneva to have a medical
anthropologist in the saddle at Rabaul,
but it would not help either native or
civil-service discipline in the Territory,
unless the appointee were of the same
stuff as William MacGregor, whose will
was far stronger than his medical in-
stincts. Papua, for its part, requires a
combination of agricultural expert, finan-
cier and expedition leader to take care of
its affairs.
There is, of course, a good deal to be
said for joint control of the Territories.
The Mandate might have lived in a dif-
ferent atmosphere if its fate had been
guided by experienced men from Papua,
men imbued with the spirit of MacGregor
and Murray, instead of by gentlemen who
had never seen a cocoanut-tree or a
kanaka. As it is, these newcomers are
not getting much out of the rich re-
sources of the lands which they govern,
except through the development which
owes its origin to private enterprise,
severely restricted.
The finances of the Mandate show a
regular annual surplus. Its national debt
is only £91,000 —the latest figures are
for 1932. It has 245 civil servants —their
salaries and those of native employees
account for the greater part of the ex-
penditure, £190,000 out of £290,000 —and
but for the discovery of gold it would
probably be in an unpleasant position,
seeing that the price of copra has
slumped, from £l5 9s. in 1928-29 to
£9 7s. 6d., subject to exchange.
The Mandated Territory appears to be
managed less like a country than like
a shop window dressed for the delecta-
tion of the League. There are scarcely
any public works outside the immediate
vicinity of the capitals of New Britain
and New Ireland unless 83 miles of roads
can be classed as such. Wharves ape
dilapidated. Progress seems to spell the
repainting of civil servants’ bungalows.
Work, as it is understood by the Admin-
istration, might be summed up as in-
spection, injection, detection and collec-
tion.
The inspection of everybody and every-
thing fills in time. The injection pro-
vides valuable data for the medical sec-
tion of the report to the League. The
Liberian and Peruvian humanitarians
who watch the Mandates with an eagle
eye are very keen on the incidence of
frambcesia, and the activities of the
anopheles must be reported on in detail
—by 11 proper doctors, 32 lik lik doctors
and the rest of the medical staffs, which
comprise 25 p.c. of the civil service. For
example:
One female only had attended the centre for
her confinement. This took place towards the
end of the year under review.
Forty-six Anopheles punctulatus (var. molus-
censis) reared from larvae or pupae in the
laboratory were fed on blood containing em-
bryos of Filaria bancrofti in numbers ranging
from 228 to 669 per c.mm. of blood.
It is a picture which confounds the
Greek delegate and strikes the Bolivian
dumb. The Ryries and the Joe Cooks who
represent us before League Commissions
cease perspiring as they contemplate the
five hundred words of graphic description
which exhibit to a hushed Geneva com-
mittee a stalwart Australian feeding those
46 mosquitoes in the interests of the native
races! But if somebody were to compel
them to show the League five thousand
Australians utilising to the full the re-
sources of an untouched territory they
would shrink with terror from the spec-
tacle. What if the Japanese encourage
their people to migrate to their Mandated
Territory? The kanaka must remain
the buffer between us and Asia,
and already sections at Geneva are asking
why his representatives are not being put
into the Legislative Council at Rabaul
and allowed to settle their own destiny.
The New Guinea problem will become
more important than ever before within
the next five years. Gold discovery has
altered the complexion of affairs already.
So has the intensification of Japanese in-
fluence in the Marshalls, the Mariannes
and the Carolines, where, after 14 years
of Mandate control, the whole territory
has been reorganised and industrialised
on Japanese lines and the Japanese birth-
rate is now greater than the native birth-
rate. But the most vital changes in Aus-
tralian outlook will come from the open-
ing of the interior of New Guinea proper.
The recent explorations of Taylor and
the Leahy brothers have led to important
discoveries behind the Finisterre. Instead
of the wild jungle which most people
visioned, there they discovered vast
plateaux with an equable climate in-
habited by kanakas of a higher type than
any yet found in the mid-Pacific. The
countryside seen from an aeroplane looks
like a chessboard. The roads are lined
with artificially planted timbers. The
opening up and westernising of such an
area must have far-reaching results, as
must the further development of gold-
mining.
It is time Australia looked ahead in
regard to New Guinea as a whole.
Murray and Griffiths, sound men both,
might well be given a chance, before they
retire, to draw up a joint scheme of
administration and development. And
their plan, not Canberra’s, should be
carried out, irrespective of logrolling and
political influence and of the desire of
Geneva to have a new and independent
colored nation sitting on the brim of
Australia’s hat.
KODO.
I entered a little shamefacedly. Besides
the little white-bearded American Sino-
logue on the platform and one English-
man, I was the only European present,
and my entrance was evidently something
of an event.
Black, yellow, brown and tawny faces
turned in my direction. A very old,
very bright-eyed and very shrivelled
Chinaman was addressing that Asiatic
audience. His extraordinary sibilant
hissing, mixed with a soft clattering of
gutturals like the twittering of innumer-
able bats, filled the room, which was
commonplace enough with its school
desks and walls, covered with badly-
drawn and crudely-colored maps by
Chinese students of internationalism.
Through the doorway I could see over
the European houses of the French con-
cession the roofs of the native city whose
walls have fallen before the march of
progress.
It was useless to attempt to follow the
speaker’s words. He spoke in Mandarin
and very fast, sweating freely through
his thin silk robes. I learned from a
neighbor, a young Hindu, that he was
the Taoist Pope whose Vatican is on a
hill outside Ningpo. If he had been the
Living Buddha himself his appearance
on a public platform in the Shanghai
foreign settlement would not have seemed
more incongruous. The little American
Sinologue jumped up after him and trans-
lated his address. He had been speak-
ing on the fundamental similarity of all
religions and the duty of all religious
leaders to combine their forces for the
common good. I tried hard to visualise
the dean of the local Anglican cathedral
joining with a Taoist priest in the cheer-
ful ritual of the Temple of the River
God.
The Taoist Pope was followed by a
cosmopolitan-looking gentleman in a
frock coat who spoke on Zoroastrianism.
Then came a dapper Chinese youth in
a Broadway suit who idealised the cult
of ancestor-worship. He was a direct
descendant of Confucius. He was fol-
lowed by an Indian devotee of Brah-
minism.
The Mohammedan mullah, head of the
12,000,000 Chinese Moslems, spoke next,
tempering the fiery intolerance of the
Prophet to the shorn lambs of world-
brotherliness. He was seconded by an
Englishman, representative of the
8,000,000 white Moslems of Europe, Brit-
ain and America.
Then the little Sinologue jumped up
again and, first in Chinese and then in
English, drew together the parti-colored
threads of this strange debate, and sought
to weave them into the warp and woof
of Christianity.
Men, he said, must be ruled by reason
and directed by love. Asia was the
natural site for the reunion of mankind,
for was not the birthplace of all the
world’s religions in Asia? On the Aryan
Olympus, Mount Meru, the modern Merv
in Turkestan, were planted the seeds
from which flowered all the major philo-
sophies and creeds which had guided
mankind through this Vale of tears.
Science, he said, was destroying our capa-
city to believe in the miraculous; yet
never did men feel greater need of the
consolations of religion.
It was science, the little Sinologue pro-
ceeded, that had fostered in us the belief
that now at last we had in our hands the
means whereby man could conquer his
environment. But instead of the pro-
mised millennium we were faced with
a world more incomprehensible, more
hostile and more difficult than ever. Our
boasted command over Nature went
hand in hand with a total incapacity to
organise a decent and intelligible society,
so that the spectacle was presented of
Governments deliberately destroying food
while half the population of the world
stood at starvation point. And many of
our economists informed us that this was
inevitable, and that we must expect to
be permanently poorer and more miser-
able, precisely because we had acquired
the means of becoming richer. Where-
fore rulers preached a new Puritanism of
suffering.
And for what? For a reward laid up
in Heaven? Not at all. The deities to
whom we were asked to sacrifice a cen-
tury of industrial progress, for whom
children must be under-nourished,
mothers must die of overwork and hos-
pitals close for lack of money, for whom
the arts must be starved and life robbed
of most of its amenities, were known by
a variety of names —exchange stability,
national solvency, the sanctity of the
gold standard. A pretty pantheon! Men
cried for bread and they were offered
this stone. A prophet would arise who
would once more convince humanity of
God’s essential unity.
A little Japanese with a solemn face
and the slightly supercilious expression
of a Buddha applauded the chairman
vigorously. Outside the building we got
into conversation, and he invited me to
a tea-house. He told me that he heartily
agreed with the last speaker. The world
needed a new religion, and it was the
Japanese who would supply it. Its
name, he said sententiously, was Kodo —
had I heard of it? Kodo was the inven-
tion of a Japanese general.
Kodo, said the little Japanese, meant
the Way of the Gods. It aimed at the
deliberate ruling out, through the press
and education, of all anarchic elements
in society. If a man fell in love in the
Romeo-and-Juliet fashion he was un-
likely to turn up at the works or the
munitions factory regularly. He might
even regard the world well lost for Juliet.
Consequently, love, as Western romantics
understood it, was regarded as bad form
by Kodo, and so were tolerance, intel-
lectual doubt and human sympathy, since
they interfered with efficiency in industry
and success in war, the two primary re-
quirements for extending the blessings
of Kodo to the outside barbarian. The
goal of Kodo, he explained, was first a
nation and then a world of obedient chil-
dren.
We drank a few cups of hot Chinese
wine, shook hands and parted. It was
indicative of the modern instinct for self-
destruction, I thought, as I regained the
street, that the invention of the new re-
ligion should have been left to a soldier.
FENG-SHUL


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Bolting Into Recess.
The sympathy of the community will go
out to the five Commonwealth “Han-
sard” reporters who collapsed towards
the end of the final sitting of Parliament.
They had been 55 hours on duty, and
on Friday, as a chronicler puts it, “23
separate bills were passed through both
Houses in the morning and afternoon.”
Blear-eyed and distraught they rose and
staggered blindly from the gallery when
the strain became unendurable.
It was not their only experience of the
sort during the session which came to
such a disgraceful conclusion. There was
a 26-hour sitting on November 16-17,
when 100,000 words were spoken in the
Reps. Between midnight and 3 p.m. on
the second day 68,600 words were taken.
“Hansard” men had to be on duty all
the time ; but so small was the attendance
of members that on six occasions between
2.47 a.m. and 5.30 a.m. the chairman had
to call for a quorum.
The excuse for the final exhibition was
that the Government wanted to rise
reasonably early before Christmas, it
being the custom to let members eat their
Christmas dinner in their homes. It is
a good job the Diggers did not work on
the same principle, or there might not
be any Canberra Parliament.
A Government which puts through
such measures as Wheatgrowers’ Relief,
Flour Tax Assessment, Wheat Acquisi-
tion, State Grants (three bills) and Old-
age Pensions Amendment with only a
pretence of debate is lost to all sense
of responsibility. The Senate was as
bad as the Reps. It sat for 30 hours,
and scrambled through, undigested and
scarcely-considered, the bills which the
Lower House hurriedly flung to it. Any
board of directors that did its work in
the same slovenly, irresponsible way
would be due for the sack.
It is a moral certainty that five-sixths of
the measures thus slammed on the
Statute Book will have to be amended
when the parties to the salary grab return
from their holiday. If it is contempt of
Parliament to despise those who transact
the people’s business in this way, then
the whole nation is guilty.

Alderman Parker, Lord Mayor.
Alderman Parker, Sydney’s new Lord
Mayor, is a solicitor. A “Herald” re-
porter who visited Mr. Parker in his
home after the election found that he had
real pictures on the wall, instead of copies
of “The Stag at Bay,” and that he admired
Galsworthy, Shaw and Barrie.
One can believe it. Either Soames
Forsyte or Shaw might well have done
what Alderman Parker did to get him-
self elected. He stood up and said:
“My Lord Mayor, I desire to nominate
myself.” His fellow-aldermen achieved
their nominations like this:
Aid. Garden, nominated by Aid. Shannon,
seconded by Aid. O’Dea; Aid. Marks, nomi-
nated by Aid. Walder, seconded by Aid. Jack-
son; Aid. Parkes, nominated by Aid. Tresidder,
seconded by Aid. Jackson; Aid. Hagon, nomi-
nated by Aid. Jackson, seconded by Aid. Mc-
Mahon ; Aid. McMahon, nominated by Aid.
Parkes, seconded by Aid. Tressider; Aid. Tres-
idder, nominated by Aid. Walder, seconded by
Aid. Marks.
A neat combination, mathematically
worked out, so that nobody would offend
modesty by nominating somebody who
had nominated him. After Alderman
Parker had put himself forward, Aider-
man Mulcahy (Labor), who loves him
about as much as he loves a Boorooloola
alligator, seconded him to annoy the
other side.
Then the fun began. Alderman Parker
voted against Labor-man Garden (at least
he calls himself a Labor man nowadays),
and the Labor aldermen voted for Aider-
man Parker, to do the Reform party in
the eye. Alderman Parker was elected.
To do him in the eye, his own party rose
like startled ibises and flapped out of the
chamber without saying a word of con-
gratulation.
Alderman Parker has a worthy pro-
gramme, so he says. Those who elected
him and those who didn’t will now settle
down gleefully to teach him a lesson
and stop him carrying it out.
One result of the sorry wrangle, which
has become almost an annual event,
should be an amendment of the Sydney
Corporation Act to provide for the elec-
tion of the Lord Mayor by the ratepayers.
Herr Kaolmel Owns Up.
The story of the Emden bell:
It is on record that the well-affixed sight
of a 4.7-inch gun on H.M.S. Hood was “re-
moved” during an admiral’s at-home; but no-
thing has been done in the Commonwealth to
match the pinching of the Emden bell. The
bell was on Garden Island, Sydney. It was
enclosed in a box in the innermost naval
sanctuary. It weighed “a little less than a
hundredweight.” One day it disappeared.
Enter a gentleman whose name sounds like
the misprinted moniker of a useful drug. He
describes himself as a motor mechanic. He
was born in Strasbourg. In August last year
he was living in Woolloomooloo on the dole,
the right to which he had earned by deserting
from the French Foreign Legion and coming
to Australia eight years ago. Except that he
had “property on Sydney Harbor,” which is,
of course, as cheap as dirt, and a nest egg in
workers’ compensation of at least £250 —he
didn’t know exactly how much, having appar-
ently been infected by the prevailing casualness
around him—and £5 a week in salary which
a kindly employer for a time handed out to
him to augment his pittance from the Govern-
ment, the gentleman from Strasbourg dwelt in
the direst penury.
One day, he says, somebody offered him the
Emden bell for £250. The somebody, in view
of his poverty, agreed to take £l5O and brought
the object along in a taxi-cab. Having no
Garden Island, Herr Kaolmel —that is the dole-
earner’s name —took the bell, presumably under
his arrp, and, going into one of the busiest
parts of the Domain, interred it decently. He
says he did not know it was stolen, and told a
lady (who knew him by a false name and not
as a misprinted laxative) about it. Then he
told a few other people, and eventually the
senior clerical officer at Garden Island and
some sappers and miners retrieved the missing
relic and locked it in the admiral’s confidential
book-chest until, feeling that this was not a
safe receptacle, they handed it over to the
War Museum.
In April this year Herr Kaolmel decided to
take a holiday. Not being a millionaire, he
did not hire a special train or the Southern
Cross. The dole and workers’-compensation
will not run to such luxuries. He merely
rented a car and, taking his best girl, pottered
iound for a couple of days. About that time
the bell disappeared. The authorities were only
three days in finding out about the loss. The
museum curator continues the narrative. .
On April 28 it was reported that the bell
was missing from its pedestal. He was on
a pier in Melbourne with Mr. Officer, an
inquiry officer. Defendant was there. Mr.
Officer asked him his name. The reply
was “Charles Watt.” When asked where
he was born, defendant said, “Plymouth,
England.” Mr. Officer questioned his
accent, and defendant replied, “I had a
Russian father. His name was Wattski.”
The scene now shifts to Hyde Park, Sydney.
A detective-sergeant found Herr Kaolmel, alias
Wattski, there, and Mr. Wattski admitted that
he had stolen the bell from Garden Island, ex-
plaining that he was wearing colored glasses
because he knew the police were after him and
he wanted to give them as much trouble as pos-
sible. Detective-sergeant Jones further said that
the defendant told him: “If you had searched
the Mariposa, which left a few days after the bell
was stolen, you would have got it.” Herr Kaol-
mel himself swore that he knew the bell was on
the Mariposa, because he had heard it from the
sailors on the ship, whom he knew, “as most
of them were my countrymen.”
Herr Kaolmel’s startling capacity for action
did not cease with his arrest. He celebrated
the last Thursday evening of his freedom
by getting married —to a probable witness
for the prosecution. Then he submitted him-
self meekly to a magistrate, who sent him to
gaol for six months. If between now and
next May a gallows or a steamshovel or any
other small, portable object disappears from
Long Bay the authorities will know whom to
ask about it.

’Planes for Ministers.
Assistant Minister Francis, wishing
to fly from Melbourne to King Island
tc open a new aerodrome there, dis-
covered that the only R.A.F.C. ’plane
available to do the job had a range of
200 miles, and therefore was unsuitable.
He had to hire a private vehicle.
It shows how backward Canberra is.
In 1920 Theodore hired a ’plane at a cost
of £lOO a day for 20 days to carry him
during an electioneering campaign in
Queensland.
So far back as 1926-27 at least a
dozen business men in Europe kept their
private machines, which brought all Con-
tinental capitals to their doors. Ramsay
MacDonald for years has never driven
anywhere if he could fly. Neither has
Hitler. A feature of Hitler’s second-last
election stunting was the conduct of his
operations from the air, his publicity
man, Goebbels, broadcasting all the time.
The Prince of Wales flies to most of
his engagements in a Dragon Moth
specially fitted to allow him to work in
comfort en route, and Earle Page, when
he was Treasurer, covered thousands of
miles in anything from an A.N.A. liner
to a Moth tied together with wire.
Mr. Lyons and his friends now pro-
pose that one of the new fast defence
machines of the Hawker-Fury type which
the R.A.F.C. is importing shall be re-
served for urgent Ministerial occasions.
Urgent Ministerial occasions will then
multiply, and as the machines are fast—
by the standards of a year ago, anyway
—Ministers will be able to gain a far
greater knowledge of the country in
greater comfort and in a shorter time
than heretofore. Mr. Parkhill became an
expert on the Northern Territory in six
weeks’ travelling at the rate of 150 miles
a day or so by car, but was bitten by
sandflies and mosquitoes and frequently
importuned by Communists. Mr. Per-
kins should be able to write a
geography of his extensive responsibility
in six days without meeting a mos-
quito or a Bolshie, since neither is a high
flier.
♦ —
Unwanted Migrants.
It was natural that Dr. Weizmann, the
Zionist leader, should turn to Mr. J. H.
Thomas in his search for a refuge for
Germany’s exiled Jews. England enjoyed
a reputation on the Continent for wel-
coming those who had been cast out by
their own countries when Karl Marx was
propaganding on behalf of revolution in
Soho, and it persists in some quarters to
this day. Also British Laborites and ex-
Laborites are supposed to have inherited
the Little England tradition regarding
the suitability of the “colonies” as dump-
ing-places.
England obviously doesn’t want the
refugees (“mainly students and mem-
bers of the professional classes”) whom
Dr. Weizmann has on his hands. A
recent cable mentioned that Lord Daw-
son, president of the Royal College of
Physicians, had expressed concern at “the
influx of German exiles into British
medical schools.”
Already 200 refugees are studying in Great
Britain, and hundreds more have applied for
permission. If permission is granted and they
obtain diplomas they will be qualified to prac-
tise anywhere in the Empire.
Australia has never taken exception to
the British professional men —particularly
doctors —who have been competing with
the native-born and native-trained for
generations. But if members of the
already overstocked black-coated call-
ings in this country have to meet the
competition of British-trained Germans
there is likely to be trouble.
Parliament could prevent the injustice
by legislating according to the French
model. In France it is illegal for a doctor,
say, to practise who has not taken his
degree in France. It works out on much
the same lines as our Immigration
Restriction Act.
«
Higher Fees for Art Students.
N. S. Wales Education Department has
suddenly decided to raise the fees paid
by art students at East Sydney Tech.
College from three guineas to 15 guineas
per annum, the reasons given being that
the art department is showing a loss on
the present fees and that it unfairly com-
petes with private schools.
The first reason is no warrant for an
increase of 12 guineas in the year’s fee ;
the second introduces an entirely new
view of the function of public-education.
Moreover it seems likely that an increase
in fees will not make a saving. The
teaching staff at present supervises the
work of 240 students, the great majority
of whom are not in a position to pay
very much more than they do at present:
If their numbers were reduced to 60 or
70, as might very well be the case, the
teaching staff could not be reduced with-
out curtailing radically the scope of the
school.
The school is an excellent one ; it covers
more ground than any other in the State ;
the work of its students has, year by
year, won the highest praise from The
Bulletin and other commentators, and
its value to a community not subject to
much aesthetic influence is undoubted.
The Vic. Gallery school charges 10s. a
term —30s. a year—but the folk who con-
trol it seem to think it is worth what it
costs them. The committee of the East
Sydney Tech. College takes the same
view regarding its institution’s art de-
partment, and it is against its advice and
wishes that the change is being made.

Native Reserves and Greed.
In Centralia near Tennant’s Creek there
is an aboriginal reserve, the home of the
Wallamunga tribe. It is arid land, but
somebody has discovered gold in it —
not much, but still gold. How anybody
came to be allowed to prospect such a
reserve is not explained. Anyway, the
Warden has now recommended the grant-
ing of g.m. leases and the excising of
25 square miles of country from the
reserve, the blacks to receive another
block somewhere else—presumably in
the desert country to the south-west.
Perkins, the Minister, answering a
protest, says that “as the natives will
lose nothing, and will possibly gain, by
the transfer, I see no objection to the ex-
ploitation of the mineral resources” ; but
he is holding his hand till he has con-
sulted the Protector of Aboriginals.
There is something wrong about all
this. Every abo. reserve should be
bordered with signs: “Whites, Keep Out.”
The country should be left to the old
men of the tribe to manage according to
their own customs, though it should be
seen to that they do not starve. This is
doubly a fair thing, because most of the
land already has been combed at inter-
vals for minerals during 70 years. If
the precedent is established that so soon
as a reserve becomes worth while to the
whites it will cease to be a reserve, the
whole objective of the segregation system
will be defeated. It won’t be long before
there are no reserves left.
In U.S.A. and other countries they do
things differently. The Indian reserves
in the U.S.A. are Indian property. In
Oklahoma, when oil was found in the
Indians’ ground, it was managed for them,
and many of them became rich. In East
Africa the right of the natives to mine
gold has been established in certain areas.
Mr. Perkins and his friends might copy
these precedents. Every native reserve
should in effect be a native State, subject
to as little interference from outside as
possible.

Powers of Parliament.
From Dr. Frederick Watson:
You contradicted my statement that the
House of Reps, had exceeded its powers in its
action against the “Sunday Sun.” It is tragic
to see a great paper accidentally misleading
public opinion.
By Section 49 of the Constitution, the prac-
tice, procedure and privileges of the Reps, are
those of the House of Commons at the estab-
lishment of the Commonwealth, until other-
wise declared by the Reps. On June 6, 1901,
Standing Orders for the Reps, were declared,
and Standing Order No. 1 enacts that, in,, all
cases not provided for in subsequent, orders,
resort shall be had to the practice of the House
of Commons “in force at the time of the
adoption of these orders.” That is to say, 36
major alterations in 97 Standing Orders of the
Commons and the 11th to 13th editions of
Erskine May are inoperative in the Reps., as
they were promulgated or published subsequent
to June 6, 1901. Ignorance or neglect of the
status created has caused misconceptions.
Erskine May (10th ed., p. 87) states: “The
member who makes the complaint must also
be prepared with the names of the printer and
publisher,” and (p. 86) “it is the present prac-
tice, when a complaint is made, to order the
person complained of to attend the House,
and, on his appearance at the bar, he is exam-
ined and dealt with according as the explana-
tions of his conduct are satisfactory dr other-
wise, or as the contrition expressed by him
for his offence conciliates the displeasure of
the House.” The motion by Mr. Corser did
not fulfil these two essential conditions.
The motion by Mr. Ward was virtually an,
attempt to try a British subject before a jury
which had prejudged him guilty. This would
be virtually creating a new privilege for the
Reps.; and Erskine May states: “....although
either House may expound the law of Parlia-
ment and vindicate its own privileges, it is
agreed that no new principle can be created.”
The two motions arose out of the “restora-
tion” of salaries. The “restoration” was
accomplished by the Government virtually sur-
rendering control of the House and permitting
the recommittal of a Government bill by a
member of the Opposition. Such unusual-exer-
cise of powers and such procedure do not in-
spire confidence.
Agreed as to the last paragraph ; but
will Dr. Watson maintain that the powers
of the Commonwealth Parliament to deal
with what it may please to regard as
offences against its dignity are in-
ferior to those of the Westralian Legis-
lative Assembly? That House in 1905
adjudged a journalist, John Drayton,
guilty of contempt and consigned him to
the common gaol without hearing his
defence or even asking for it.

Troubled Newfoundland.
Britain’s oldest colony is in dire financial
straits. About half the size of Victoria!,
it is a bleak and barren medley of
marshes, lakes and tangled rivers bound
in by a rugged coast line, in places ris-
ing 2000 feet from the sea. After John
Sebastian Cabot discovered it in 1497
there was a good deal of wrangling for
it —its fisheries were the attraction. The
British got a foothold in the seventeenth
century, only to have it taken away by
the French after the treaty of Utrecht
had established it as an English posses-
sion in 1713. Australia has a link with
Newfoundland here —Captain Cook was
in at its recapture from , the French 170
years ago and made a marine survey of
its coast.
Now it has nearly 300,000 inhabitants;,
who are having a desperate struggle for
existence. In 1927, it established a claim
to control Labrador in the hope of
developing the resources of that barren
land of ice, but all it got was 110,000
square miles of trouble.
Newfoundland is, of course, a
Dominion. It has had Prime Ministers
who swanked it at Imperial Conferences,
beside the Ramsay MacDonalds and the
Bruces, with an air which belied the fact
that they were delegates from a Parlia-
ment whose two Houses are limited by
the Constitution to a total of 51 members.
St. John’s, the capital, which has 30 per
cent, fewer people than Hobart, holds
more contention and political accusation
than any other town of the same size in
the world.
Since the depression, the finances have
slipped from disaster to catastrophe. The
island’s accumulated deficit for the past
three years has been equal to a year’s
revenue. Last year a gap of 3,000,000
dollars was evident after 8,000,000 dollars
had been collected, and the public deb£
is about £18,000,000 sterling, or about
£B2 per head. This doesn’t sound so bad
after Lang, but the icy little island hasn’t
the resources or the recuperative power
of N. S. Wales. It is gradually losing its
paper and pulp trade, which provides
half its export revenue of £6,000,000-odd
p.a.
Australians will sympathise with the
Newfoundlanders. We, too, know some-
thing of inept rulers and the troubles of
little States. And our'Gallipoli veterans
can testify that, if Newfoundland breeds
bad politicians, it also breeds good men.

“C.P.C.”: Port Essington (N. Aus.)
these days doesn’t look like a place where
British and French sea-dogs once frater-
nised. Following on the occupation of
Melville Island and Raffles Bay, Captain
Sir Gordon Bremer left Sydney aboard
the Britomart and dropped his mud-hook
in Port Essington on October 26, 1838,
having taken possession, on the northern
voyage, of Cape York and the adjacent
territory. Within a day or two of his
arrival, Bremer learned that D’Umont
D’Urville, with the Astrolabe and the
Zelee, was at Raffles Bay. He thought
that the French might have had the idea
of forestalling the British settlement at
Essington, and decided on a friendly ges-
ture. Lieut. P. B. Stewart was posted
off by boat to Raffles Bay with an invi-
tation to the Frenchmen to come and
have a spot at the new settlement. The
French ships were brought round to
Essington, and for a few days and nights
things were lively with corks popping.
What a fine subject it would make for
a historical picture!

“Cinna”: Somerset Maugham to a
London interviewer:
I went to Australia and enjoyed my stay
there very much. Unfortunately, in my book
“The Narrow Corner” I misspelt Manly as
Manley, and attributed a two-column murder
report to “The Bulletin,” mistakes which brought
the Australian population about my head, my
word! I shall alter the errors in the next
edition —when it comes out.
A frank and quite disarming mea culpa.

“Lord Luvus”: Melbourne hatters are
becoming more and more perturbed over
the steady growth in numbers of the Lid-
less Legion. Half the youth of the town
now do the Block with their naked locks
waving in the breeze. When it rains they
acquire a temporary lid for a penny-
halfpenny by purchasing a “Star” or a
“Herald.” One hatter says that if this
pernicious custom could be stopped the
hat trade would be immediately restored
to prosperity. My own impression is
that the hat-makers have themselves to
blame for the growing tendency to dis-
pense with hats. Let them invent a
tile that a man could be proud of. Males
are just as vain or artistic in these matters
as females, as witness the variety and
pleasing elegance of their sporting cos-
tumes.

“Coif” : Interesting to note that Darrow,
the U.S.A. advocate who specialises in de-
fending desperate cases of homicide and
other crimes of violence, has
professed himself profoundly
shocked by the recent lynch-
ing outbreaks in America. It
is natural that he should be.
If prospective clients were
always to be scragged by irre-
sponsible amateurs without
being given a 'chance to brief eminent
counsel, then Clarence and his co-crafts-
men would find their occupations gone,
like Gilbert’s clergyman who found his
parishioners “so ridiculously good.”

“Parchment”: It is not and never has
been the practice in South Aus. to appoint
K.Cs. every three years (B. 29/11 /’33).
The method of appointment varies from
the English practice and that of most Aus-
tralian States. The State Chief Justice has
the sole right of appointment, and exer-
cises it free from all political influence,
so neither public servants nor persons
standing in favor with the Government
can expect preferment. All South Aus-
tralians have sufficient confidence in the
Chief Justice to know that he would not
be likely to divulge the names of
proposed appointees to anyone, and that
propaganda would not favorably impress
him.

“Binduli”: Newton Moore was a stout
and jolly Westralian Premier —he is now
a British M.P.—but I once saw him lose
his temper in public. It was about 25
years ago, when the goldfields were still
“And all I said was ‘Where are you going
for Christmas ?’ ”
agitating determinedly for a railway to
Esperance and had adduced, as an added
argument for closer communication with
the Eastern States, the wheat-growing
possibilities of the soil between Norse-
man and the long wash of the Southern
Ocean. Moore sent Jimmy Mitchell
(now Lieut.-Gov.) to have a look around
the land, and Jimmy dashed through the
300 miles or so in the horse-drawn
vehicles of the period. Armed with
his colleague’s opinion, the Premier
told a Kalgoorlie deputation, a trifle
regretfully, that the productivity of
the land had been exaggerated.
Even Mitchell, an optimist in all
agronomic matters, had formed a
poor opinion of it, he pointed out. “He
went through it mostly at night,” some-
body objected. “And he had nothing
more to guide him about the capabilities
of the soil than occasional glimpses at
the tops of the trees,” put in another
goldfielder ironically. Moore said he
wasn’t going to hear his colleague in-
sulted, and the meeting broke up in some
disorder. Still, Newton had his revenge
a few years later when, asking Parlia-
ment to sanction the building of the
northernmost half of the line (from Cool-
gardie to Norseman), he mentioned that
in addition to opening up new mining
country it would be admirably suited for
camel-breeding. Camels breed in the
Sahara.

“Selma”: Auntie, who for some time
has been threatening to take a slimming
course, was invited to a bridge drive last
week. The chief attraction was that all
the other women bidden there were slim-
mers also, and the affair was to be a
“liquid day,” all solids being severely
excluded. We advised auntie to eat a
good breakfast just in case, and saw her
off, thus fortified, at 9 a.m. She gave
us the diet chart when she returned. On
arrival everyone had a glass of sherry ;
at 11 o’clock beef-tea was served; at
midday there was a whisky-and-soda;
soup followed at one, then- coffee;
orange drinks arrived at three, afternoon
tea at four, soup at five. Aunt returned
full of enthusiasm for the slimming craze.

“S.W.K.”: It was at the White City
courts during the first tennis Test. A
small boy, his arms overflowing with the
“empties” he had been gathering during
the 20-minute interval —his failure to
provide himself with a bag marked him
for the amateur —met disaster as he
passed the western stand. As he stood
ruefully surveying the ruined half of
his stock-in-trade someone threw down
a paper to help him salvage the un-
broken bottles. Another kindly soul,
more practical-minded, tossed down a
few pennies. Others followed suit,
and the air was soon thick with fiying
coppers, while the boy darted about
retrieving them. Then the inevitable cop,
with a sober, heavy dignity, called a
halt and dispersed the crowd that had
gathered on the pathway. The boy looked
dubiously at the arm of the law to see
if that official viewed his gains as ill-
gotten ; then, taking silence for acqui-
escence, he hurried off, his unbroken
bottles forgotten in the thrill of his
treasure-trove of coppers.

“C. Coral”: Some more relics of the
Mutiny of the Bounty have come to
light. In a letter to a friend,
Mrs. Young, of Pitcairn, re-
lates that, while some of the
island men were out fishing
a few weeks ago, one of
them, with the aid of glasses,
discerned the historic ship’s
rudder on the bottom of the
sea. Using grappling irons,
they first recovered the old
gudgeon and pintle, with a
copper and brass band
around, and then brought iip
the rudder. These interesting
trophies have been lying be-
neath the water ever since the
eventful day, over 140 years
ago, when Fletcher Christian
and his men settled in Pit-
cairn after casting Bligh and
18 others of the company
adrift in an open boat near Tahiti. It
is to be hoped that one of our own
museums will acquire them before they
get into the hands of private collectors
overseas.

“C.Q.”: Subterranean travel is becom-
ing a habit with the Melbourne small boy.
During the height of the late storm
another specimen fell into a drain
and, after a comrade had hung on to his
leg until he could hang on no longer, dis-
appeared into a tunnel. His cobber im-
mediately rushed to the Moonee Ponds
police station and reported the happen-
ing. A constable hastened in a car to
the Moonee Ponds creek, where he found
the youth, cut about and tired but happy,
climbing on to the bank. His disappoint-
ment was acute when he learnt that his
journey had been a mere three-quarters
of a mile, whereas the record is one
mile and a quarter, established by the
Kew champion a month ago.

“Dairich”: The depression goads even
the alms-beggar to originality. The other
evening in King-street, Sydney, an appari-
tion smelling atrociously of beer lurched
up against me and spoke a new piece.
“Me luck’s rotten!” he said. “I’ve bin
without a feed all day, an’ I just saw a
two-bob piece lyin’ on the road, an’ before
I could pick it up a car comes along
an’ it sticks to the wheel.” I thought his
hard-luck story deserved something;
there was a par. in it, anyway.

“F Deck”: The swimming-pool on the
Strathnaver had no attractions for one
elderly gentleman when he set out on
the recent cruise to Noumea ; anyway, he
took no costume. But after leaving Bris-
bane the mercury mounted; and early
one morning, when he concluded that all
good people should be sound asleep in
their bunks, the elderly one thought he
would try it. Stealthily creeping round
the deck in his dressing-gown he reached
the pool and plunged in au naturel. He
was splashing about and thoroughly
enjoying himself when two flappers
arrived in the latest in backless costumes.
They had made a late night of it and
decided to refresh themselves with a dip.
In they dived, and away the son of Adam
struggled. He was turning blue, and was
almost exhausted through treading water,
when the bathing attendant came along.
The situation was explained, and two
hilarious young women made themselves
scarce what time the embarrassed ancient
wrapped his dressing-gown round his
shivering form and reeled back to his
cabin.
ONE SHILLING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
~ Ex : P l em i« r Hogan, who sued the Central Execu-
tive of the Vic. Labor party for wrongful expulsion,
was awarded one shilling damages and costs by
Justice Dufly.”
They tried and condemned him, afar and away;
they d hardly have dared were he here.
t y as b utc hered a tergo, a fellow might say,
Caesar—run through from the rear,
ret, .though Justice may limp, as old Horace
averred,
He s got a bit back from the mob
lo pay tor the boot and the bounce and the
bird.
They’ve given the martyr a bob.
My word!
Long Ned’s been awarded a bob.
They damned him, he said, in his country-
men’s eyes
For a rodent, a quitter, a dud;
Ihey smeared his escutcheon with .envious lies,
a dau b e d it with soot and with mud.
And they did him, he argued, the deadliest dirt
When their attitude cost him his job.
authis Honor appraised the particular hurt
that Ned had sustained at a bob.
Twelve pence!
The plaintiff recovers a bob.
It left him, he showed, in invidious case
And thoroughly piteous plight.
But there’s never a stigma the" Law can’t erase
a i ff wwn S it’s not ready to right.
And “Here’s one,” you can hear Justice Duffv
reflect,
“For the Central Executive’s nob,
And two for its heels” (’neath his breath, I
suspect),
When he soaked the whole lot for a bob
And costs;
When he mulct the transgressors a bob.
For the downtrodden masses Ned still may
crusade.
He may trail a long coat on the green;
But no more may he flutter the Labor cockade.
It s flattened him out, the machine.
Still n’ all, I suggest, it should lighten the cross
He must bear and the load he must lob
To know that a Judge has apportioned his loss
In coin of the realm at a bob —■
Just that!
They’ve given Ed Hogan a bob.

T. THE R.


“Stewart W.”: Our town is still
chuckling over the enterprise (call it that)
of a young couple whose offspring car-
ried off the prize in a baby show organ-
ised by the most strait-laced of local
churches. They had been married fully
six weeks.
* * * *
“Cauboy”: Two eminent Melbourne
painters were hunting for antiques at
the Victoria Markets. One of them
happened to have his latest picture —-a
still life —under his arm, being on his
way to the framer’s. He noticed a very
bad reproduction of a very bad Land-
seer in a cheap gilt frame, and for a joke
exhibited his own work to the stall-
holder. “Will you exchange this for that
stag?” he asked. The salesman looked
at the painting critically for half a minute,
then handed it back and said “Sorry,
sir, thanks! Can’t do it!” The painter
in question recently sold a similar pic-
ture to the National Gallery for 120
guineas.
* * * *
“D.E.”: Fate oddly mixed the desti-
nies of C. J. de Garis and George Coch-
rane, who called himself Grant Hervey.
They met first at Mildura in 1919, when
Hervey, posing as an American, tried to
elbow De Garis out of his job as pub-
licity man for the A.D.F.A. and urged
his claims at a public meeting. De Garis
“My life is an open book.
“WHAT a story.”
settled his hash by asking what the
stranger’s real name was and where he
had spent the previous three years. A
year or two later Hervey turned up in
Mildura again as editor of a paper which
was furiously hostile to De Garis. He
carried the war to Melbourne, where he
put up posters announcing the impend-
ing collapse of the De Garis interests, a
proceeding for which he was tarred and
feathered. He anticipated events by only
a few months. The spectacular De Garis
ventures did fail, and, after disappearing
across the Tasman and returning to face
the music, poor C. J. took his own life.
Hervey himself died miserably last
month. A week or two later came the
bankruptcy of the De Garis estate, which
had been carried on unavailingly by the
widow: liabilities, £255,900 ; assets, £520.
* * * *
“FY7”: I also received an education
which taught me “the disadvantages of
sloth and crime” (B. 6/12/’33). It likewise
imbued me with a sense of the worthless
in literature. It was my childhood’s habit
every afternoon, when I was supposed to
have gone down to the horse
paddock to bring in the
station milkers, to dive into
the men’s hut and there im-
merse myself in a luridly-
covered volume belonging to
the cook entitled “The True
History of the Kelly Gang.'
Thither one day came my
dad, having noticed that my
saddled pony had broken
away from its place of con-
cealment behind the hut and
was walking about the home-
stead. He said nothing:
merely took me by the scruff
of the neck and went outside
to the saddle-rack. Holding
me between his knees he ex-
tracted a stirrup leather from
one of the saddles, doubled
it, and proceeded with his
course of instruction. To this
day, like the gentleman in the
“Bab Ballads,” I fancy “I can feel the
place in frosty weather still,” while the
mere mention of the Kellys sends a
shudder through me.

“The Rag”: Nothing new in corsets
for men (B. 6/12/’33). London shops
have been selling them ever since the
Regency days, when close-buttoned cloth-
ing with a “waist effect” was de rigueur
among the bucks and dandies. Corsets
survive to this day among elderly beaux,
while they are almost regulation with
Hussar regiments and the R.H.A., whose
very tight-fitting, beltless tunics and shell
jackets call for some confining influence
to prevent the figure bulging in the wrong
places. Nor are “body supports” any-
thing new in Australia ; a year or two
ago a very swish Sydney firm was adver-
tising them.
* * * Sr
“Oakabella”: Atlee Hunt, first secre-
tary of the Prime Minister of Australia,
writing about titles conferred upon
his countrymen, recalls that John
Forrest was the first G.C.M.G. The
regalia consists of a massive gold
collar adorned with lions and Maltese
crosses, also a mantle and chapeau
of blue satin lined with scarlet silk
and surmounted by ostrich feathers;
and Forrest, unlike later recipients of
the distinction, “loved to display his
finery.” He may have done so, but it
is hard for those who knew him in his
earlier Westralian days to feature him in
all this splendor. My first impression
of Bigjohn was gained at Cue in the
early ’nineties, when he went coat-
less. A few years later, speaking
at Geraldton, he wore a coat and
waistcoat—conventions were gradually
asserting themselves —but his pants
were belted, and between the waist-
band and the lowest waistcoat-button
was a large unsurveyed allotment of
shirt—the wearer was already running
to flesh —that looked like a certificate of
rugged democracy. I’ll swear that nobody
who listened to Bigjohn that night could
ever have pictured him in a collar of
gold and a mantle of blue satin ; but you
never know what a man may come to.
“What did your old man say when you told him you’d won thirty quid, and him
so down on punting ?”
“‘Terrible,’ he said, and then he borrowed the thirty.”
“Lord Luvus”: Melbourne Working
Men’s College is, after much argument,
to suffer a change of name to the Mel-
bourne Technical College. Curiously
enough, there was a row over the name
50 years ago, when the institution came
into being. Francis Ormond, a philanthro-
pist, offered £22,500 to found an estab-
lishment for providing higher education
for the workers. Among other stipulations
he insisted that it should be called “The
Leopold Workingman’s College.” The
Trades Hall arose in fury and objected to
the name of a royal prince being attached
to such an institution. The philanthro-
pist retorted that if he couldn’t do what
he liked with his own money he would
take it to Germany. In the end, how-
ever, he yielded, and the place became
the Working Men’s College. As in 1883,
it is the Trades Hall which objects to the
second change of name, on the ground
that it is a piece of snobbery.
* * * *
“Linseed Lancer”: Another scoun-
drelly act of Federal aggression on N. S.
Wales. During the Boer War, King Ned
presented the N.S.W.R.A.M.C. with a
King’s color —a unique distinction for
the medical services, which, though they
have a crest, “carry no colors.” Some-
how the Federal military authorities got
the prized rag into their hands and have
claimed it ever since. The N.S.W. South
African Veterans’ Association is furiously
demanding the return of the property to
Ma, but Pearce is side-stepping all attacks
with his usual agility.
“Diba More”: “X.S.” (B. 25/10/33)
is right when he says that Melbourne was
the first Australian city to have a wire-
less-equipped police patrol car ; but he is
a bit out in his dates. In 1922 Senior
Constable Downey suggested to Chief
Commissioner Nicholson that the two
patrol cars be equipped with wireless.
Nicholson approved, but Cabinet refused
to supply funds. The Commissioner
then approached the A.W.A., and it was
through its courtesy that the first car
was equipped. Messages had to be tele-
phoned from Russell-street to A.W.A.
headquarters and put on the air.
I ater the Government decided to
move with the times and gave permis-
sion for a transmitting station to be
erected at Russell-street. When Com-
missioner Blarney took over the job at
least one of the cars had been equipped
with wireless for about two years.
* * * *
“Bullionist”: Arrival in M.L. of a
shipment of specially-designed and newly-
minted half-crowns has been accom-
panied by a statement that these were
manufactured from the Royal Mint’s
“quarternary alloy.” This alloy consists
of one-half silver and three other in-
gredients, names and proportions of
which are the Mint’s secret. Prior to 1920
the silver coinage of Britain contained
per cent, of silver. In that year the
market price of silver of that degree of
fineness went up to over five bob an
ounce, and at one stage the silver coins
contained a shade over their face value
of the precious metal. So the silver legal
for coinage purposes became 50 per cent,
stuff, and for four or five years the Brit-
ish bob was half silver, half copper.
Coins made on this recipe betrayed their
base origin under wear, assuming at last
a distinctly brown shade. So the metal-
lurgists of the Mint went into conference
and produced a compound which has
three advantages —it is the most durable
half-silver alloy known to science, it
keeps its color under wear, and nobody
not in the secret can duplicate it. Paris
and Budapest mints spent a lot of money
on experiments, but gave up in disgust.
* * * *
“Jerry”: Don’t know about honor
among thieves, but there is sometimes
consideration. Burglars broke into the
railway station at Enoggera (Q.) but
failed to open the safe, owing to the
fuse burning out before it reached the
explosive. That settled their hope of
plunder, but before they went they left a
warning note on the floor: “Danger.
Explosive in Lock!”
* * * *
“Spokeshave”: What is art? Cer-
tainly a radio broadcast direct from
nature isn’t music. The other evening
the A.B.C. sent an emissary to Phillip
Island, Vic., to catch the mating song
of the mutton-birds. The result re-
sembled the noise made by an unoiled
spring dray descending a steep incline
with brakes on. Yet there is no doubt that
composers have often got their subject
matter from such phenomena, e.g., Beet-
hoven in the “Pastoral Symphony.” The
performance on Phillip Island will be re-
peated nightly until March, but it is un-
likely the commission will give it a
second metropolitan hearing.
“Old Point Pott”: N.S.W. traffic mad-
ness is well exemplified in the decision to
test the loan trolley ’buses between Syd-
ney and Potts Point. The Point already
has a ten-minute ’bus service; in one
direction it is only five minutes from a
virtually continuous tram service to
George-street, and in another from a
fifteen-minute tram service to Circular
Quay. The district is entirely built over,
and any increase of population is only such
as may come from a twenty-suite block
of flats being replaced by one of fifty
suites. Macleay-street is one of Sydney’s
few completely well-grown avenues ; the
40-year-old planes meet across the street.
If any street should be left free from a
forest growth of iron pipes and cross-
wires it is this magnificent show
thoroughfare, yet with scores of tramless
and ’busless suburbs crying for a trans-
port service nitwit Bumble must choose
to deface Macleay-street.
* * * *
“Anaf”: No one with a knowledge of
chemistry would try to destroy animal
tissue by simple immersion in strong
sulphuric acid (B. 1/11/’33). The action
of the concentrated acid is chiefly that
of a dehydrating agent. But when water
is added to ‘it tremendous heat is
generated through the resulting chemical
action, and it is in this form that the
acid will destroy tissue. The same thing
applies to quicklime as a destroying
agent. By itself it is something of a pre-
servative, but if water be added it will
destroy a corpse in a remarkably short
time. Many murderers who used the
stuff to get rid of their handiwork have
gone to the scaffold because of their
ignorance of this simple chemical fact;
amongst them Crippen, himself a doctor.
SLIMMING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A women’s cycling club for slimming purposes
has been formed in Sydney.”
No more they bank on the restricted meal
To keep the graceful lines that lure the beaus:
Adroitly posed upon the whirring wheel
They pedal off superfluous adipose.
To stay the seams from straining on your
clothes
And make the buttons fasten where they did,
You Helens and CEnones, starve the crows!
There’s positively nothing beats the grid.
It gives the calves a smack of baby veal;
The fallen arch incontinently goes;
The chiselled instep gains a new appeal
With (or without) those dainty silken hose.
Curves thought too bounteous, one may
suppose,
Shed sudorific tribute, dust amid;
Lard the lean earth, in short. Which clearly
shows
There’s never weight-reducer like a grid.
Along the countryside with hefty heel
They fly, and thoroughly assertive toes,
Shedding the gleaming sleekness of the seal
For something more of a Titania pose.
Do they look nicer—slenderer? Who knows!
I offer no award, nor ever did.
Only, for healthy perspiration-flows,
I’ll bet a bob there’s nothing beats the grid.
No more in Turkish baths may they dispose
Their limbs, to be of flesh too solid rid;
But when it comes to scorching round in rows
For slimming—well, my money’s on the grid.

POLITICAL POINTS
Sir Horace Rumbold, formerly British
Ambassador at Berlin, does not think
there v/ill be another war in Europe in
the near future because he is convinced
that nobody wants it. Still, nobody wants
influenza.
Printed that “recruiting for the C.M.F.
is being curtailed owing to insufficiency
of money.” There was enough money
to give Commonwealth members and
Ministers another £9785 a year; but
that’s different.
Of all rulers who speak English Craig-
avon, of Belfast, whose Government has
just been returned, has the steadiest job.
He has been Prime Minister of Northern
Ireland since it was established in the
middle of 1921. There is no Labor party
to worry him ; his House of Commons
is elected for five years, and he is always
sure of at least two-thirds of the seats.
When Ulster politics pall he can refresh
himself at Westminster, being one of the
members for County Down. His fellow-
Priministers must envy him.
Hubert Murray reports that the Papuan
Administration is dangerously under-
staffed. The Commonwealth allowance
has been cut down £15,000 in the past
couple of years. It is asinine parsimony
in a place where head-hunters haunt the
fringes and occasionally—as in 1932
raid a village and go home with 50 heads
or so, and where in an area the size of
Victoria 1100 whites are planked down
among 275,000 natives.
Casey speaking—Casey, the new Com-
monwealth Assistant Treasurer.
lhe new rate of income tax on personal
exertion is expressed thus.
85 taxable income
As (3 plus - )d. where the
100 160
taxable income does not exceed £6900.
If you can’t follow this, the department
responsible for such conundrums will
work it out for yoti. Should you desire
to check its solution, hire a taxation
agent—the country is swarming with
them —and be hanged!
The by-election for Stanley (Q.) re-
sulted in R. M. Bell retaining the seat
for the Opposition by a three-to-one
majority over the Independent, Langden.
There was no Labor candidate.
Under Lyons’s Wheatgrowers’ Relief
Bill farmers who paid income tax last
season are to be denied a share in the
proceeds of the sales tax on flour, unless
they can show that they will pay no tax
this season. The aim apparently is to
cut out Queensland growers who have
received fixed prices through the depres-
sion and will have good 1933-34 returns ;
but this could have been achieved with-
out punishing good farmers in the four
States growing wheat for export —punish-
ing them for being good farmers. Field,
president of the N.S.W. Farmers and
Settlers’ is right: “This discriminating
clause places a premium upon ineffi-
ciency.”
Like the Canberra Legislature, Queens-
land Parliament took on the role of a
sausage machine in the closing stages of
the session, and rushed through miles
of debatable legislation at lightning
speed. One of the measures gagged
through gives the Ministry majority rep-
resentation on the five boards governing
the medical, dental, optical, pharmacy
and nursing professions. In the past
these have consisted of members of the
professions concerned, with a Govern-
ment representative. The Government
now takes command of each, even the
professional registrars of the boards
being supplanted by appointees from the
civil service.
The collaring of trust funds, raised
from particular interests for special pur-
poses, seems to have become a settled
part of Australian Government finance.
It is none the less hateful because Labor
practises it and then condemns it, as is
the case in N. S. Wales. Defending the
transfer of Main Roads Board, Super-
annuation and Liquor Compensation
money to consolidated revenue, Manning,
the N.S.W. Attorney-General, said:
Whatever the state of the funds might be
the Crown will honor its obligations. In fact,
the Crown is undertaking a further obligation,
behind which stands consolidated revenue.
But the same assurances were given to
the N.S.W. Government Savings Bank
depositors. A guarantee was even printed
on their passbooks.
It has been a fixed belief with Mel-
bourne people that they live in a million-
city, like Sydneyites, but the census shows
that there were only 992,048 in June —a
mere 54.5 per cent, of the population of
the State. Natural increase has doubtless
made up the difference since. To assist
decentralisation Heidelberg is to be
turned from a shire into a city. It covers
an area of miles, and is thus probably
POLITICAL STUDENT: “We can't do nothink about this bread bizness, you an’ me.
We’re just a coupla prawns in the game.”
the largest city in the world. Melbourne
congestionists feel friendly towards
Heidelberg, notwithstanding ; it is really
a suburb.
Sydney Harbor is to have more empty
destroyers added to its scenery. So soon
as the much-advertised flotilla now on its
way down the Australian coast arrives, the
crews of two vessels, totalling about 200,
will be paid off and sent to depots ; the
ships will be tied firmly to buoys for
an indefinite period. Lack of money is
the excuse, as usual.
Vic. Leg. Ass. has passed a much-
needed measure in the bill to give official
recognition to members of bushfire
brigades entering private property to put
fires out. Hitherto a man has sometimes
had to interrupt his salvage work to
indulge in a domestic brawl with a
property-owner who regarded his collec-
tion of brush, forest, dry grass and dead
undergrowth as his castle. Now the bush
brigades will be on much the same foot-
ing as the city ones.
Not only the weather is hot in Mac-
quarie-street. With Spooner pointing out
that performances in the matter of farmers’
relief were better than piecrust promises
of 7s. 6d. a bushel; with Lazzarini cry-
ing “bumptious snob,” and Lang shouting
that by the Holy Ghost he was going to
protect himself against “unscrupulous
Ministers,” N.S.W. Parliament last week
was in its best form. Speaker Daniel
Levy tried to calm the tumult, but Canute
was a great success beside Daniel in
such moments.
E. J. Hogan, who lost his job as Vic.
Premier while away in England, got a
shilling damages, with costs, from the cen-
tral executive of the A.L.P., which had
expelled him for supporting the Pre-
miers’ plan, but an injunction forbidding
it to exclude him was refused. The case
is mostly interesting because it involved
the plea that a politician who is cast
out of the party fold has his livelihood
interfered with. T. J. Ryan, when Premier
of Queensland, threatened the National-
ist executive with an action for suggest-
ing that he was a capitalist. He said
that his living and position were en-
dangered. The N.P.C. merely published
his letter, and no more was heard of
the matter.
Westralian Premier Collier was asked
in the Assembly when the report of the
Parliamentary committee appointed to
draw up the case for secession would
struggle into the light of day. He replied
that he had no idea. The truth is that
he is sick of the very name of secesh.
Not so Mr. D. G. O’Leary, of the Wheat-
growers’ Union, who suggests that Collier
should “achieve our freedom” by “plac-
ing the police in charge of the Customs
and other centres of Federal activity.”
Mr. O’Leary is of opinion that this is
“the only way we can get out.” Collier
is going to attend a disabilities confer-
ence or something instead.
There is a growing conviction among
members of the Lang faction that their
dictator is a dud. They blame his clumsy
handling of the N.S.W. Leg. Council
business for the poor results shown: 45
members elected and only 13 Langsters
among them, although the Country party,
with less than half the number of elec-
tors, has nine members. The slump in
Lang stocks is aptly illustrated in the
pre-selection advertisements of Lang can-
didates for the Senate in the “Labor
Daily.” In 1931 one and all stressed the
fact that they were for “Lang and
Labor.” This time they omit all mention
of Lang.
Stevens told the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly
last week that he is negotiating with the
Loan Council for £9,256,304, but “it does
not necessarily follow that this amount
will be spent.” Of the total, £6,130,000 is
to go in threadbare schemes of unem-
ployed-relief, with £42,240 as a Christmas
box for out-of-works. Most of the
schemes run to concrete, but perhaps
cement cos. are listed as unemployed.
Grain elevators like that at Newcastle,
which is being built against expert advice,
dams, public buildings and lots of water
and sewerage works figure in the pro-
gramme, which won’t make permanent
work for anybody, except a few more
clerks to tot up the interest.
Stevens’s Government came in for
criticism last week from two C.P. mem-
bers ; and some of it was warranted.
Wade, of Barwon, rightly objected to
there being 15 Ministers ; the number is
out of all reason. And Carter, of Liverpool
Plains, deplored the lack of provision
for settling suitable out-of-works on small
holdings, though an excellent scheme was
drawn up by practical men on shire
councils, accepted—and forgotten when
the Act was passed. Canon Bob Hammond
started a small-holdings scheme of his
own in the neighborhood of Liverpool;
and the men are getting along. There are
immeasurably better opportunities in the
neighborhood of country towns, where
the small-holders could get casual work
from farmers and graziers.
Some of the Sydney municipalities
which control ocean beaches have. spent
a mint of money on improvements,
mainly in concrete, which were not re-
quired and which bathers who travel in
cars rarely use. As a result, Waverley
owes something like half a million, and
in the latest year for which the Govern-
ment Statistician gives figures its income
was £171,300, its expenditure £216,100.
Manly’s income the same year was
£149,100, its expenditure £170,700. Yet
Manly Council wants to spend £19,000
of unemployed-relief money on dressing-
sheds at South Steyne, though at least
half the people who bathe at Manly now
prefer the ferry co.’s pool on the harbor
side to either South or North Steyne.
Assistant-Treasurer Spooner has vetoed
the proposal until the ratepayers have
been consulted ; and Spooner is right.
Queensland “sports” are of opinion that
the Forgan Smith Cabinet is getting too
big for its boots. They converted a
majority of the Labor Caucus to their
view that control of racing should be
taken out of the hands of the Q.T.C.
and placed in the keeping of a board
of Government nominees of the right
sort. Last week Caucus ordered that a
bill to this effect be prepared and rushed
through before the session closed. The
outvoted Ministers got together later and
decided not to present the bill until next
session at least. As this is several months
off, the boys are feeling annoyed, and
are asking what has become of soli-
darity.
They must be an immoral lot in Eng-
land. A Judge there, commenting on
the evidence given before him in a tin-
hare case, said the roguery exposed was
worse than anything of the kind he had
ever heard of. That cannot be said of
N. S. Wales, where Great Men give the
poor man’s sport their countenance.
Only the other day one of the gentlemen
surprisingly elected to the N.S.W. Leg.
Council did not consider it beneath his
dignity to apply for a tin-hare license at
Richmond. It is improbable that the
eminent Trautwein will get it; but the
gesture is noteworthy.
Archbishop Mannix regrets that “Gov-
ernments have lost the habit of giving.”
The taxpayer’s experience is that they
are not noticeably backward at giving,
especially when a general election’s com-
ing. Still, they are better at taking.

Melbourne Uni.’s new salaried Vice-
Chancellor will probably be Dr. A. C. D.
Rivett. Rivett was born in the Speck and
educated at Wesley College, Melbourne,
and was the 1907 Rhodes scholar. He is a
brilliant chemist. At present he is on
the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research.
Retiring at the end of the month, after
62 years of service, is C. W. Wren, one
of the joint general managers of the E., S.
and A. in Australasia. He joined the bank
in Adelaide in ’72. A lad of 15 at the
time, he was, nine years later, appointed
accountant and inspector. In 1909 he
became Australasian general manager
and was head serang until a change in
the system of control in 1928 gave him
as colleague Ernest O’Sullivan.
David Cox, a Melbourne boy who
moved to S.A. early this year, has won
an Elder scholarship (organ) at Adelaide
Conservatorium, passed his first year for
Mus. Bac., and had a piano composition
selected for broadcasting. And he is not
18 yet.

survivor did not pass, as a contributor
surmised, when the Last Post rang for
Dave Holloway at Hill End (B. 8 / 11/’33).
Still able to do a day’s work on his farm
at Bungarby, Monaro (N.S.W.), Tom
Johnson remains in the final. As a boy
of 15 he served on the Furious when
that warship was engaged in the siege
of Sebastopol.
James Nangle, superintendent of tech-
nical education, is far from being the
quavering ancient a man ought to be
when he retires under weight of years.
He has held his present job since just
before the war, and at 65 looks as if he
still had half a century to go. He is

dent of the N.S.W. Royal Society and a
Fellow of the Institute of Architects.
Between 1919-23 he made a good job of
N.S.W. vocational training for soldiers, as
he has done of all the tasks set him.
Twenty years ago he wrote a standard
work on Australian building practice.
Customs-gatherer E. Abbott, who suc-
ceeds E. T. Hall as Comptroller-General,
has been with the department for 40
years, the last half-dozen as Deputy-
C.-G. He held a number of positions
in N. S. Wales, including that of senior
inspector, till, in 1924, he went to Mel-
bourne as chief surveyor. In 1930 he
attended the Imperial Conference with
Priminister Scullin, and he was at Ottawa
last year. Chairman of the Tariff Board
McConaghy, who ran Abbott close for
the new appointment, is to have his
salary raised to the same figure.
J. T. Isles is one of the best-known
commercial men in Brisbane. He is a
partner in the firm of Isles, Love and
Co., and while his partner James Love
runs to financial organisation—he is a
J. T. ISLES, president of Brisbane Rotary.
director of the Q. N. Bank—J.T. goes in
for clubs and public movements. He
manages things so unobtrusively that
few people realise the full ambit of what
he does. As president of Brisbane Rotary
he has splendid civic work to his credit,
especially in connection with the estab-
lishment of the Montrose Home for
crippled children.
Harold Gengoult Smith, Melbourne’s
Lord Mayor, who was a principal in his
city’s biggest wedding, has had a strange
career for a civic panjandrum. He is 43
years old and has been a member of the
City Council since 1921. By profession he
is a doctor, but he has little time for
serious practice these days since he is
president of 20 committees, commands
the Brighton Rifles (he was a Dragoon
Guard in the war) and has the centenary
arrangements on his hands. He has been
in the mayoral chair since 1931, and after
1934 Dick Whittington will have nothing
on him.
John McLaughlin, a native-born, 79-
year-old Victorian now living at Broad-
ford, knew Ned Kelly as a rollicking
lad, full of fun and mischief. When the
Kellys left Avenel they stayed with the
McLaughlin family for four weeks. Born
on April 4, 1854, McLaughlin grew up at
Moonee Ponds. In 1868 his family went
overland with a waggon and seven horses
to Tabilk, near Goulburn Weir, crossing
the Goulburn at Murchison on a punt,
which was ferried across with a windlass.
The old man is still in good health, and
his stories of the pioneering days are well
worth listening to.
“Joe” Ewing, new joint general
manager of the E., S. and A. Bank, is
one of a family with a splendid
record. Bob, the eldest, is Com-
monwealth Taxation Commissioner;
Jack is one of the best-known Sydney
wool auctioneers and managing director
of Pitt, Son and Badgery ; Bill, who in
his younger days was a pretty good ath-
lete, is a senior metropolitan inspector
of schools ; Joe is the fourth brother,
while Tom, the youngest, is a widely
known throat specialist at Newcastle
whose handles include 8.A., B.Sc.,
M. 8., Ch.M., F.R.C.S. (Edin.). There
are two sisters, one being the wife of
W. R. Charlton, editor of the Sydney
“Mail”; the other the wife of “Tossie”
Roberts, senior lecturer at the Teachers’
College.
Paddy Webb, elected by a 2-to-l
majority as Labor member for Buller
(M.L.) in succession to Harry Holland,
had been out of politics for 16 years. He
was elected for Grey on the Labor ticket
in 1913 at a by-election and re-elected in
1914. He resigned in 1917, was re-elected
unopposed, and was sent to gaol for a
year in 1918 for refusing military service,
the seat being declared vacant. Paddy
was a member of Bob Semple’s tunnelling
contract party from 1921 to 1924 (the
gang made world’s records for excava-
tion), and since then has been Christ-
church manager for a co-operative coal-
mine in Westland. He was popular in
the House, and when he was lumbered
for sedition John Findlay, K.C., on the
other side in politics, undertook his de-
fence and nearly secured an acquittal.
Can any other public company in Aus-
tralia beat the National Mutual Life for
the number of titled directors? Out of a
board of seven six are knights: J. H.
MacFarland, M.A., LL.D. (Vic.), chair-
man ; D. Orme Masson, K.8.E., M.A.,
D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., vice-chairman;
Robert Gibson, K.8.E., C.B.E. ; Brudenell
White, K.C.8., K.C.M.G., K.C.V.0.,
D.S.O. ; Harold Luxton, M.L.A. ; and
R. Stawell, K.8.E., M.D. Herbert
Brookes makes up for being a plain
“mister” by having been High Commis-
sioner in America.
J. F. Hennessy, whose kindly face
shines out of this page, was educated at
St. Patrick’s College, Goulburn, at Syd-
ney Uni. and at the University of Pennsyl-
vania. He inherited an architect’s busi-
ness founded by his father in Sydney in
1884. He was for four years in charge
of the Department of Building Construc-
tion at Sydney University. He soon
established himself in his profession and
was architect for the completion of St.
Mary’s Basilica in Sydney, to several
other churches and to numberless office
J. F. HENNESSY, an Australian archi-
tect with an Imperial reputation.
buildings throughout Australia. Then
his fame spread, and he designed build-
ings for M.L. and S. Africa. J.F.H. is
architect to the Colonial Mutual Life,
and for that company built not only its
fine set of offices in Brisbane but its South
African headquarters, and he has in-
spected and made a report to the com-
pany on the whole of its buildings in the
Empire.
Although knight George Murray, S.
Australia’s Chief Justice and Lieut.-Gov.,
passed the Scriptural threescore years
and ten a few months back, he can still
come through a day’s hard work with
colors flying. His Honor’s father was a
pioneer pastoralist, and the son was born
S.A.’s Chief Justice MURRAY. He is
also Lieut.-Gov.
at Magill (S.A.). A student at St. Peter’s
College and Adelaide University, he later
went to Cambridge, where he was brack-
eted senior in law tripos. Called to the
Bar in 1888, he took silk in 1906, and
was elevated to the Bench in 1912.
Four years later he was made C.J. and
Lieut.-Gov., and gained his title in 1917.
Chancellor of the Uni. for quarter of a
century, he founded the Tinline scholar-
ship for historical research.
Poet Peter Hopegood, whose book of
verse “Austral Pan” created a stir in
reading circles last year, has settled in
Sydney with his wife. Hopegood is an
Englishman (born at Billericay, Essex,
and educated at Dover College) who was
badly knocked twice in France while
serving with the Essex Regiment. He
received his blighties at the Menin-road
and St. Quentin. Before the war he
spent five years in Canada, and after
demobilisation he turned to school-teach-
ing and commercial art. He came to Aus-
tralia nine years ago, and has spent most
of the intervening years in the Westralian
bush and pearling. His book of verse
was highly praised by Hugh McCrae in
The Bulletin. He married Olive Clucas,
who has written a lot for W.A. papers
as “Felix Reb,” and with her husband is
represented in “Jarrah Leaves,” the first
Westralian writers and artists’ annual.
Heredity gets a further boost from the
astonishing Dorsch family in S.A. Rev.
Dorsch, a Lutheran pastor who died in
1916, left a widow (a prominent exam,
coach) and eight children. All of them
won University bursaries, and have
scored in various professions. One is
now a master at King’s School, Parra-
matta (N.S.W.), one an Edinburgh sur-
geon, one a Rhodes scholar of S.A. The
youngest has just headed the year’s list
in his final medical exam.; incidentally,
he is an inter-State man at hockey. On
the same day, an elder sister who gave
up the ’Varsity to undertake nurs-
ing (latterly for the B. H. Proprietary at
Iron Knob, S.A.) won the rare C. H.
Spence Sociology scholarship, which
gives her £440 for overseas study of
child welfare.

The Federal Government’s announce-
ment of an extra 6d. per pound customs
duty on tobacco, estimated to yield
£130,000 by June 30 next, had no effect
upon the market for this co.’s scrip. The
pound ords., which rose from 255. 6d. in
Sept., 1931, to 335. 7d. at the end of
1932, were steady at 375. 6d. last week-
end. The return at 375. 6d. is 3.2 p.c. on
a 6 p.c. div. basis ; so the investor who
looks for 4.2 p.c. on his money counts
on the div. going to 8 p.c. The prefs.,
whose div. was subject to a deduction
of 2s. in the £ in respect of the Federal
tax on income from property, strength-
ened from 275. to 28s. 6d. following
announcement of a 50 p.c. cut in this
tax. The reduction is now to be 40 p.c.,
leaving the div. in the hands of share-
holders at 6.1 p.c. as against 5.8 p.c. pre-
viously. At 28s. 6d. the return would be
4.4 p.c. on a 6.1 p.c. distribution.
The co. controls a group of tobacco-
manufacturing subsidiaries which con-
stitute one of the largest industrial organi-
sations in the Commonwealth. The
health charts of the operating cos. are
not exhibited, though they have proved
themselves a robust lot, and the holding
co.’s own figures tell little more than they
have to. At Oct. 31 its capital
(£9,619,186), its own reserves (£32,121)
and £73,524 of creditors’ money and
credit balances was invested in shares in
other cos., £7,722,192 (cost); debtors’
and debit balances, £1,988,392 (largely
advances to the pups) ; cash, £14,247.
For 13 years to the close of accounts
in ’27 a steady 12 p.c. was paid, sweet-
ened with £628,591 of bonus scrip. Then
a two-for-one gift (£2,324,131, provided
by writing up the book value of shares
in other cos.) lifted capital to its present
figure in 1,484,727 6i p.c. cum. prefs.
and 8,134,459 ords., and the ord. div.
dropped to 10 p.c., but rose to 12 p.c.
again in 1930. Then the public cur-
tailed its expenditure on smokes, and
competition sharpened, while the spring
in exchange, tariff and income and other
taxes swelled outgoings, and the div. fell
to 6 p.c. The board, however, continues
its assurance that disclosed profits do
not include undistributed earnings of the
subsidiaries, whose turnover can be
safely said to have improved.

This co. was promoted by Thomas
Confoy in 1921. He got £12,500 in

Whatever this youngster gained on the
swings during the last term it appears
to have lost on the roundabouts. It put
an extra £214,392 of new business on
the books, and its mortality experience
was only 43.8 p.c. of the figure allowed
for, which is as it should be in a young
office. There was little change in the
average amount per policy (£275), and
the average premium per cent. (£3
13s. lOd.) was 6s. lighter, which suggests
that a bit more longer-term business was
written:

Renewals were £34,199 less than the
previous year’s first and renewal pre-
miums combined. The slip was due
mainly to lapses, which retard develop-
ment of profit-earning capacity by their
effect upon costs. Excluding interest
payments (£776) and income tax (£4065,
shown separately for the first time), exes,
got away with 52.5 p.c. of the net pre-
miums—including taxes the figure was
54.7 p.c. as against 49.7 p.c. for ’32.
Over the next three years the board aims
at reducing the ratio to about 34 p.c.,
which is still a high figure.
The office assumes that its investments
will net 4 p.c. on its life fund, whereas
last year’s interest and rents less tax were
£2 16s. lid. per cent, on the mean fund.
The gross return was £3 12s. 6d. per
cent.; so, even if the co. paid no taxes
at all, the return would still be short of
the mark.
That arouses curiosity as to the quality
of the assets, which are in this form:

Allowing for a loss of £714 on reinsur-
ance of accident business, the year’s sur-
plus of incomings over outgoings was
£42,679. The growth in the book value
of net tangibles was £18,587. The dif-
ference is accounted for mainly by the
£22,464 struck off the book value of
shareholdings, etc. (chiefly in Southern
Star Fire, Accident and General Co.), and
other assets, making the total so struck
off over the last three years £45,119;
and the “Wild Cat” won’t swear that
all the assets are now worth their book
value. Assuming that they are, net tan-
gibles exceeded the life fund by £43,350
at June 30. Paid capital is £300,000.
It is plain that neither regular bonuses
to policy-holders nor dividends for share-
holders are yet in sight. Still, the A.P.A.
provides a striking example of what can
be done with a life office which hangs
back in the traces. The best assist-
ance policy-holders can give the man-
agement is to maintain their payments.

With the growth of the Australian textile
industry and the development of the
specialty house, chain-store and other re-
tailing methods, the softgoods wholesaler
has seen much of his business slip away.
To make up his volume of trade he has
had to gather a multiplicity of small
orders, thus increasing overhead as well
as credit risks. Then slump reduced
turnover, exchange made London credits
expensive, the tariff added to landed
costs, profit margins were swallowed by
price recessions, and bad debts exceeded
expectations.
It has all left R. R. and Co. over-
capitalised. Also, a trading loss of
£88,845 in ]3l was followed by another
of £12,209 in ’32, when exchange on re-
payment of London debentures cost the
co. £16,653, and £43,869 was struck off
for bad debts. Conditions were better
during the last term, and a profit of
£1670 was claimed, reducing the amount
of capital unrepresented by tangibles to
£63,593 at June 30.
To clip £14,046 off the overdraft,
£42,094 off the amount coming to trade
creditors, and add £28,902 to the stocks
item, the book value of plant, etc., was
reduced by £48,303 (apparently provision
for depreciation), debtors’ balances by
£75,778, and cash, etc., by £14,429:

The more or less liquid surplus (£792,371,
including stocks) was £5llO lighter than
at the close of accounts in ’32.
Since the close of accounts capital has
been reduced to £744,277 in 100,000 first
and 187,500 second prefs. and 456,777
ords. by returning in cash 10s. and ss.
per share respectively to the firsts and
seconds, and by striking ss. per share
(£152,259 off the ords., thus wiping out
the p. and 1. debit (£133,546). The
prefs. remain cumulative, but the divs.
have been lowered to 5 p.c. firsts and 6
p.c. seconds, with the right to advance
to their old contract rates with the ords.
after the latter have had 6 p.c. Also, the
prefs. have been given the same voting
power as the ords. By agreement,
arrears of divs. have been paid at approxi-
mately half the new rates. On capital as
it now stands, the minimum pref. divs.
will call for £16,250 p.a.
The market prices the firsts at 18s. 6d.
and the seconds at 18s., the return at
these figures being 5.3 p.c. and 6.6 p.c.
respectively. The net tangible cover is
£8 6s. 7d. firsts and £3 18s. 2d. seconds.

This co. took over Tasmanian Cement
Pty.’s business, including a large shale
deposit, at Latrobe (Tas.) for £165,845
in scrip at the end of 1928 ; it put out
a further 117,500 8 p.c. prefs. and a like
number of ords. to help finance a new
65,000-ton plant and provide for exten-
sion of the old one (20,000 tons). Dor-
man, Long managed the show till Sept.,
1932, and Kandos, now linked up with
Australian Cement, became interested.
But when public loan funds ran out, con-
struction work of all kinds was curtailed,
and the co. got behind in payments to the
prefs.
There was more Government and other
spending during the last term, and gross
earnings (£56,137) sprang £16,777, while
overhead (£27,959, including an extra
£5OOO for depreciation, £15,000) took
£8,783 of the increase. Minor reserve
adjustments made the net result £BOO6
better at £28,264, of which £22,894 was
handed to the prefs., cleaning their slate
to Sept. 30 last, and the ords. got their
first taste (2\ p.c.).
There was marked improvement in the
finances:

The book value of fixed assets was re-

knocked off the overdraft. Allowing for
the final divs., outside liabilities exceeded
cash, book debts and stocks by £6475
at Sept. 30, an improvement of £20,148
over the twelvemonth.
A couple of years ago the shale deposit
was sold for £14,000 in Tasmanite Shale
Oil scrip. The loss on the deal was
£28,554. To wipe out this loss, together
with £16,000 of preliminary exes., and
write £11,200 off the book value of share-
holdings and £29,552 off plant, 6s. Bd.
per share (= £85,286) is to be lopped
off the ords. That will reduce paid
capital to £286,020, of which £143,092 is
pref. money, now carrying a fixed cumu-
lative 7 p.c., as against 8 p.c. previously.
At Sept. 30 there was £27,643 of calls
unpaid on the ords. Last year’s net earn-
ings were sufficient to pay the prefs. 7
p.c. and show 12.8 p.c. on £142,928 of
paid-up ord. capital.
At 255. 3d. the prefs. return 5.5 p.c.
The ords. seldom come on to the market.

The £14,312 of profit was made up of
£2643 (up £2144) from Australian sources
and £11,669 (up £2518) from outside the
Commonwealth. Victoria, where four
machines were installed towards the
close of accounts in 1931, and S. Aus.
and Westralia, where the doubles tote has
proved popular, all contributed to the
improvement; in N. S. Wales the State
tax continued to affect turnover. The
source of foreign earnings is not men-
tioned, but royalties come in from the
co.’s machines in Southern Asia and at
Miami, U.S.A. After handing the prefs.
their £3875 (10 p.c. less 22\ p.c. statutory
cut), there was enough to give the ords.,
who were passed by in ’3O and ’3l, an
extra 2 p.c., making 5 p.c. for the year,
and put £846 on the shelf. In addition to
the reserves shown in the table there is
£121,322 to set against an unspecified
amount of patents, etc., and the £lOO,OOO
at which the ord. shares in the French
subsidiary appear.
On the market the prefs. advanced
from 18s. 6d. to 245. 6d., and the ords.
from 10s. to 195., over the last 12 months.
Allowing for the statutory cut, the return
from the prefs. at 245. 6d. is 6.3 p.c.,
and the ords. at 19s. yield 5.3 p.c. on a
5 p.c. div. basis. Prospects of further
improvement in earnings look encourag-
ing ; much depends upon whether the
doubles tote is installed at Ascot and
other Sydney courses, upon sales of the
co.’s new mechanical ticket issuer, and
upon the extension of business in
America and Europe. Still, since 1918
the ords. have averaged only .p.c.,
including a 25 p.c. bonus (£47,956), paid
from £lOO,OOO received for the English
rights (exes, made off with the difference).
The French subsidiary has £200,000 of
capital, one half 10 p.c. cum. prefs. and
the other half ords. The parent took
the ords. in part-payment for rights, etc.,
and guaranteed the pref. div., in respect
of which it has been called upon for
£25,823. During its last term the pup
handed back £3466 of this, leaving
£22,357 to come when earnings permit;
it also repaid £16,141 advanced by the
parent for trade purposes. Prospects for
the ords. largely depend upon whether
the business can be sold on satisfactory
terms.
The parent’s finances benefited, of
course:

When the public became interested in
1924 it looked like a steady 10.8 p.c. pro-
position. Presently shareholders put up
an extra £96,406, including £10,726 of
share premiums, to help finance the in-
stallation of a new Nathan brewing plant,
and provide for general expansion of
the business. The work interfered with
the 1928 figures, and then slump brought
a sharp contraction in earnings and
trouble with debtors’ balances. The new
plant couldn’t earn satisfactory returns
on its own cost plus the book value of
the old one, losses instead of profits
showed up, and shareholders have had to
go without for the last four years.
The board says it has pursued a con-
servative policy, and the figures support
the claim. The losses have been due
largely to provision for depreciation and
bad and doubtful debts, etc. In 1930 the
provision for depreciation was £83,308,
made up of £12,805 from p. and 1.,
£37,272 from general reserves and
£33,531 previously undisclosed. Gross
earnings, which fell from £43,270 in 1927
to £17,286 in 1930, were £48,727 last
term, when the spring was £5661 ; ordi-
nary trading exes. (£19,190) took £llO3
of the increase. After earmarking
£11,082 for depreciation and £9791 for
bad debts, etc., enough profit remained
to show 3.8 p.c. on capital, reducing the
p. and 1. debit to £35,668, equal to 3s. 4d.
per share. The board is considering the
question of wiping out this debit, thus
clearing the road for the resumption of
divs. The debit leaves out of the reckon-
ing provision for depreciation (£119,408),
equal to 39.6 p.c. of the book value of
{’‘Wild Cat” continued on page 18.)

Love and affection
£5OO
WHEN that boy of yours reaches 21, how will he
be equipped for life? He will be enriched by
your love and affection. He will have all the
good qualities that you have cultivated in him, and he
will have a good education. How would it be if, in
addition, he had £500?
It is surprising how little a parent has to invest in an
A.M.P. policy to ensure to his (or her) boy a sum of
£5OO when he is 21. So very little, just a few shillings
a week. Ask the nearest A.M.P. representative to tell
you all about the simple plan.
Last year the A.M.P. Society issued 79,442 policies,
assuring £13,610,326, nearly half of them to members
who already had one or more policies. The A.M.P.
is the largest mutual life office in the Empire, with
assets valued at £90,000,000, and it is a wise parent
who uses it to bring satisfaction to his family and
himself.
A book, “Inventing in Happiness,” will be gladly sent
to all who enquire.

the stocks item, debtors’ balances were
reduced by only £4638 and cash, etc., by
£3BlO. The spring in the more or less
liquid surplus (£42,853, including stocks)
was £10,29,6, making the improvement
£34,059 over the last three years.
The market prices the pound shares
at 16s. 9d. Assuming that capital
remains unaltered, the return at that
price would be 4.8 pc. on a 4 p.c. div.
basis. Excluding specific reserves, the
cover is 17s. 9d. per share in net tan-
gibles.
Day Dawn, New Guinea, one of the
best of the reefing propositions yet
located on the Morobe goldfield, and
the first to! set up its own crushing and
cyaniding plants, has opened up a
couple of new formations; On the lowest
level a crosscut on the footwall side
shows a width of 13ft., averaging loz.
9dwt. fine. Over a width of 7ft. on
the footwall side the lode averaged loz.
19dwt. to the ton. When the excavations
for the cyanide plant were being ex-
tended, two very rich veins in lode for-
mation were cut. The extent of the
formation has yet to be proved.

At Devil’s Mountain, Kilkivan (Q.),
a number of new reefs carrying varying
gold values and ranging in width from
an inch to a foot have been discovered.
A local syndicate has installed a battery.
First worked over 40 years ago, the field
has yielded some rich ore.
* * * *
At Soldier’s Cap, 30 miles s.-e. of Clon-
curry (Q.), the Comstock, under option
to a Brisbane crowd, has crushed 28
tons for fine ounces of gold since
the beginning of the year. Water is
plentiful, but transport and treatment
costs are heavy. The place was the
scene of a rush in 1867.
* * * *
A parcel of 6 tons Bcwt. from the
Yours and Mine, at Yabba Creek, 16
miles from Imbil (Q.), returned 17oz.
lOdwt. of gold, making the total 330 z.
from the last 10 tons 18cwt. crushed.
The reef, which averages 6ft. in width,
has been traced on the surface for 750 ft.
The show has been taken over by a new
Gympie syndicate, and the shaft is now
down about 55ft. Near by, Thomson’s
party is at work on Breakneck Creek,
where last 45 tons returned about 80oz.
Others have not met with much success.

“Hornby”: At Lightning Ridge opal
field (N.S.W.) small fresh finds continue
at depths of from 2ft. to 12ft., chiefly
in the Angledool-Boundary area and
at the Old Bullocky workings, on the
western end of the business quarter. Old
gougers opine that not a tithe of the
hidden wealth has yet been won; but
what it will cost to unearth it is prob-
lematical.
* * * *
The A 1 Consolidated (Vic.) has not
lived up to expectations. To the end of
August the co. had taken out 1285 tons
for 2640 z. 14dwt. of gold, an average
of about 4dwt. The mine is patchy, and
unless the grade improves the co. will
need to put through 1000 tons or more
monthly to make ends meet. The dumps
contain over 100,000 tons of 3dwt. to
4dwt. stuff, which might yield a small
profit if treated on a 'large scale. But
that would mean raising fresh capital.
* 4= * *
After an absence of some years, Mt.
Bischoff (Tas.) returned to the dividend
list with two ss. distributions during 1933.
The mine was discovered by James
(Philosopher) Smith in 1871 ; the present
co. was formed in 1873, smelters were
put up in the following year, and
£lOO,OOO was spent before any return
was made to shareholders. The output
to 1933 was 6,002,500 tons of ore for
80,200 tons of concentrates, valued at
£5,366,448, of which £2,531,000 (= £2ll
per share) was paid in divs. Owing to
the falling off in values and the low price
of the metal, operations were suspended
in Oct., 1929, and portion of the property
was let on ttibute.
* * * *
The New Briseis Co., Tas., will
presently seek fresh capital to enable it
to work its big deposits of drift tin on
a large scale. The water-race, over 30
miles in length, cost some £BO,OOO. The
bursting of the dam and the disastrous
flood early in 1929 settled the old co.,
which had paid £595,291 in divs.
The Kalgoorlie Miners’ Union has
drawn up a new schedule of wages and
conditions for the industry in Westralia.
The demands include a minimum wage
of £1 per shift, margins to remain as they
are ; five shifts of eight hours on the
surface and seven hours underground;
abolition of the night shift, or a week of
five shifts of six hours each ; abolition
of piecework, or all underground workers
to be so employed ; extra pay for flota-
tion hands. At the moment 44 hours
underground and 48 hours on the surface
constitute a week’s work, the minimum
wage being 14s. 4d.. per" shift. An in-
crease to £1 per shift would cost the
principal producers on the Golden Mile
an extra £265,000 per annum. The extra
benefits claimed are based on the rise
in the paper price of gold.

For the year to June 30 last Lake
View and Star’s bullion sales, etc., were
£324,092 better at £882,411. The de-
clared net result (£439,305) benefited by
£155,159 of the increase, and a 50 p.c.
div. (the first) called' for £267,500. There
was £71,382 coming to creditors. Cash
(£77,869) and bullion in transit (£70,428)
totalled £148,297 ; debtors, £11,443 ; in-
vestments, £94,116 stores, £47,430;
plant, etc., £310,251. Ore reserves, at
2,161,600 tons, show an increase of over
329,000 tons ; the average grade at 325.
per ton (gold 85s. an ounce) was a shade
under 2s. less. A feature of the year’s
work was the opening up of the so-called
Boulder lode of the Ivanhoe in the
Golden Horseshoe workings. It appears
to be a branch formation connecting the
two main lodes of the Horseshoe between
the fourth and eighth levels, below which
it is expected to peter out. It has given
the co. at least 100,000 tons of ore, aver-
aging 50s. or more.
* * * *
Westralia’s most spectacular gold find
since the Bullfinch is that unearthed by
Kozul and Mullens at Mulline. After
breaking 52 tons of stone, worth £15,000,
they optioned the show to the Brown’s
Reward Co., now the Lady Gladys, for
£17,000. Last week the option-holder
sent 3} tons of bagged ore to Kalgoor-
lie ; it yielded 9340 z. 7dwt., an average
of approximately 2.670 z. per ton, without
tailings. The co., which has about 200
tons of stone ready to go through the
Young Australia battery, expects to make
enough profit to cover the purchase price
before Christmas. Over the last three
months the claim has yielded about
£23,000 from 55| tons of ore, obtained
from shallow workings.

On the strength of Dr. Loftus Hill’s
report on its North Wiluna (W.A.) pro-
perty, Granites Development has applied
for 14 additional leases, and arrange-
ments are being made for a thorough
geological survey of the holding. Accord-
ing to Dr. Hill there is 4000 tons of pay-
able stone above the 200 ft. level in lease
460 J, and the belt of fine-grained green-
stone, which continues for about 25
chains east of the mine workings, pro-
bably contains additional shear lines.
Northwards from the big Wiluna mine
the calc-schist belt is about to be explored
by the Agnew group, and Claude de
Bernales is arranging finance in London
to test his reservations further north
again.

there are many, are pleased at the pros-
pect of a part return of capital, expected
to be something over 6s. a share. Mind-.
ful of what has happened of recent years,
some feared that the board might fritter
away in options and unsuccessful mining,
etc., the £50,000 received for the co.’s
gold show at Reedy's (W.A.).

The old Queen Margaret, at Bulong,
east of Kalgoorlie (W.A.), has been
pegged by.... Wark,. Kingsborough and
Stevenson. The mine has produced
61,0000 z. from 62,000 tons ; in its early
days it disclosed several extraordinarily
rich patches. Childe Harold, near Laver-
ton, and Kapai, at the north end of Kal-
goorlie, have also been disinterred and
optioned.

Claiming to be the only woman own-
ing a goldmine in Australia, the Moulden
lady is directing development and produc-
tion at the Bindah, near Linden (W.A.).
Between 1913 and 1924 previous owners
extracted about ll,ooooz. from 25,000
tons.

A report on Tanami’s Kenya Colony
venture by Bewick, Moreing and Co.
states that the area under option
(about 900 acres) has three reefs in
shallow ground which average well so far.
No forecast is given as to how they are
likely to shape at depth. Sons of Gwalia
and London Australian and General Ex-
ploration are helping to back the spec.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
E.E.H.: Ex-manager Westcott figured that
there is 83,166 tons averaging 6dwt. on No. 9
level. He put costs at 255. per ton. On these
figures, and with gold at £7 an ounce, the profit
would be £70,680. This level has not yet been
worked, but stone crushed to date has been
unpayable, yields being below expectation....
Horseshoe: At Sept. 30, 1932, the co. had
£102,809 in the bank; there was only £13,235
coming to creditors. At the same date 1,751,524
tons remained to be treated. This is being
cyanided at the rate of about 40,500 tons
monthly for a working profit of about £1630,
exclusive of the exchange premium. The
board’s power to reinvest surplus earnings de-
pends upon wording of memorandum and
articles of association R.E.: (1) and (2)
See B. 6/12/’33. (3) Names of subsidiaries,
etc., not published, but co. took over Stanmore
Preserving (Sydney), Kirkpatrick and Co.
(Nelson, M.L.) and Queensland Govt, canning
factory all within the last decade. Henry
Jones and Co. (Hobart) is the chief subsidiary.
... .F.C.W.: A.M.P. for preference....
C.M.8.: See B. 8/2/’33... .H.J.W.: If safety
of capital is important, leave it alone.

THE HOLY
SEASON.
By RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
THE hot, red Christmas moon looked
upon the spirit of the holy season,
represented by three gentlemen who
had drunk wisely, but not yet too well.
They had made pilgrimage from Mel-
bourne to East Melbourne from 3 p.m.
that Christmas Eve, stopping at every
hotel in Collins-street to Spring-street,
and then making north to Gisborne-
street, where there was but one hotel to
the street block.
Distance teaching them prudence, they
had remained in the hotel, entered at
dusk, until the big, hot moon rose from
behind the Dandenongs ; for here was re-
freshment, and between this caravanserai
and the next was a great asphalt desert
a whole street block wide.
Gredden, the bespectacled heavy man,
whose black beard was grey-streaked, was
at the moment dividing his attention be-
tween beer and Christian resignation to
his own sufferings. Junor, the very tall,
very thin, young man, refused to believe
in the existence of anything not quite
beautiful and absolutely right, beer being
to him merely new optimism and high
idealism. Brown, the short tubby man,
to whom malted liquors were laughter,
announced at intervals of two minutes
that they must have more beer and find
somebody for the purpose of “pulling
that somebody’s leg.”
On the mantelshelf of the whitewashed
fireplace Gredden had deposited his
parcel, the brown-paper container at
whose open end appeared the head and
wattles and six inches of the neck of a
defunct turkey—one of the martyrs of
that season which is never holy for
poultry. Gredden’s glance at short in-
tervals returned to his turkey, a glance
that began in suspicion and ended in re-
assurance as he found the turkey still
safe and unstolen.
The tall young man ordered more
drinks, and Gredden feebly protested.
“When we met this afternoon, you said
le’s have a drink. A drink is one drink.”
“Pulling your leg,” said Brown. “Fig-
gerer speech. I said ‘le’s have halfer doz’n
drinks.’ An’ we had ’em.”
“Mustn’t lose little panties, love.”
“Had ’em and more,” said Junor.
“More like doz’n half —mine’s gin.”
“You had beer.”
“Nev’ mind! Way to keep sober is to
switch ’em. What’s yours, Gredden?”
“I don’t think I’ll have any jus’ now.”
“You must. Chris’mus, and all that
kind of rot.”
“ ’Tisn’t rot,” said Gredden. “Spirit o’
Chris’mus still here, thang God All
the year no spirit o’ Chris’mus. Life, hell.
Me grown-up family and me wife got
no time for me. Take all me salary and
give me nothin’ but black looks an’ nag-
ging ; and when I say something, they
say, ‘On’y the ol’ man talkin’. Wha’s he
know about anything?’ And I gave her
me two houses.
“King Solomon knew better. ‘Give not
thy substance to thy family during thy
lifetime lest after that they bring thee
unto heaviness.’ Solly knew.”
“You didn’t know much when you kept
them alive by feeding them, Gredden.”
“That’s so; but only all the year;
Chris’mus they’re nicer to me. That’s why
I got that turkey; cost me twenty-five
bob for Chris’mus. I don’t mind. Peace
on earth and goodwill to all men.”
“Green-peas on earth and bad luck to
all ducks,” said Brown.
Gredden finished his beer and waxed
tearful.
“Sometimes in the year I feel like tak-
ing cyanide. Chris’mus is the only thing
saves me all the year. They take all and
give nothing.”
“Leg-pullers,” said Brown. “Stringers-
on an’ leg-pullers—that’s what women
are, once they’ve caught a man.”
“Not all of ’em,” said Junor. “My
wife’s all right. When she’s at home —
and that’s dam’ seldom,” he added, his
optimism and loyalty fleetingly illumin-
ated by the truth.
“Two beers and a gin,” ordered Brown.
“No! Three beers,” corrected Junor.
“I’ll switch again.”
Gredden, gloomily waiting for the new
drink, elaborated his trials.
“/ like underdone meat,” he com-
plained, “and they cook it up to char-
coal, because they like it, and I don’t
matter. They fry meat! It’s almost in-
credible, but they do. They fry it. And
I want a grill with the red juice in it.
What do they do? They fry it until it
curls over like a boot put in the oven
to dry and forgotten. They give me
some dam ’ thing on a plate and call it
a steak, and it’s only a carbon gondola.
They’re murdering me with carbon gon-
dolas.”
Junor evidently had his wretched
memories. “That’s right,” he said, “car-
bon gondolas, or a Turkish scimitar made
of charcoal.... But does she ever stay
out all the afternoon at bridge and bring
home half a pound o’ cooked corned beef
to feed a hungry man with?”
“She does,” replied Gredden. “When
it isn’t bridge, it’s charity.”
“Charity that never goes home,” said
Brown.
“Charity,” repeated Gredden sternly.
“Makin’ a great name for charity on my
money, and then bringing home two
bobs’ worth of ptomaines for dinner.”
“Leg-pullers,” repeated Brown. “Leg-
pullers—all of ’em.”
“Not all,” objected Junor feebly, loyal
still.
“Except at Chris'mus,” said Gredden ;
“she’s kind at Chris’mus. An’ they all
send me Chris’mus cards. She sent me
one with two angels and a seagull.”
“Which won?”
“One what.”
“Which won the flyin’ match?”
“No flying match. The seagull is tell-
ing the angels that it’s a merry Yuletide.”
“What’s a Yuletide? I know spring
tides and neap tides, and the tide of for-
tune that I never took at the flood ; but
what’s a Yuletide? Do they float the
Yule-log home on it?”
Gredden’s beer must have suffered dis-
placement, because he became full of dig-
nity.
“Yuletide is Yuletide,” he said, “and
that’s Chris’mus, the holy season ; peace
on earth and goodwill to all men. Fill
’em up again.”
“This house is finished now.”
“No, it isn’t! There’s no mortgage —see if you can find one!”
The front doors of the hotel had closed
long since, but the customers still entered
by the back door, and pressure of busi-
ness slowed the service down. While they
awaited the new beer the friends talked
with those sudden revolutionary changes
of conversation that appear crazy, except
to men made over-tolerant by alcohol.
Junor’s eyes were glazing, but memory
was alive and made him quote. They all
quoted, the subject changing from the
selfishness of women to the idealism of
them, by stages abrupt.
“Certain women,” Brown had said,
“are more than leg-pullers. They’re like
spiders— eat the male as soon as he’s pro-
vided for the next generation. 1”....
“Never mind spiders,” Junor inter-
rupted ; “whatyer think of this:
“ ‘Ah! happy they to whom such words as
these
In youth have served for speech the whole
day long;
Work! Contest! Fame! All love’s confederate
pleas—
Hour after hour remote from the world’s
throng! ’ ”
“Tosh,” said Gredden.
“Tosh?”
“Tosh and bunk,” said Brown ; “pullin’
y’r own leg. It’s the music gets you,
that’s all.”
“He’s right,” said Gredden, “jus’ the
music ; jus’ like
“ ‘Gone the ripple and the rushes
Of the love songs of the thrushes,
And the roses in the closes of the garden, and
the blushes
Of the shy verbena creeping
By the old south wall and steeping
All its sweetness in the slumber of the sleepy,
summer hushes.’ ”
“Jus’ the music.”
“Not all the music, but the fact,” per-
sisted Junor, “like that
“ ‘ln golden woods I heard
A golden-throated bird;
And “Love! Love! Love!”
He sang. And “Love, Love, Love.” ’ ”
“ ‘And “Love! Love! Love! ”he sang,’
and two bobs’ worth of ptomaines from
the ’am-an’-beef. You’re pullin’ your own
leg, and every fool says that to another
fool so that they can be foolish enough
to get another fool to carry on the fool-
ishness.”
“The spirit of Chris’mus,” mused Gred-
den, with tears in his voice. “The spirit
of Chris’mus.”
“Here’s the beer at last. Drink hearty.”
“To the spirit of Chris’mus,” said Gred-
den reverently, and finished his drink.
“Let’s go.”
He turned to the mantelshelf, whereon
had reposed the turkey-expression of the
holy season, and then— —
A bear robbed of her whelps has been
said to be a dangerous thing; but there
are no similes for Gredden’s short-lived
and ferocious rage. Searchings suc-
ceeded, and inquisitions ; all vain, for the
turkey was no more.
So the but-one-drink and exeunt
omnes, Junor and Brown vainly trying to
comfort the bereaved with their variant
philosophy. To all their comfortings he
replied, heart-brokenly, and in one word
—“Chris’mus.”
“Nev’ mind,” said Brown ; “day after
to-morrow Chris’mus will have vanished
into the Ewigkeit.”
“My turkey!”
“It’s vanished into the Ewigkeit already
.... ’sail right, old man ; it’s only anti-
cipated the Ewigkeit by twenty-four hours
—tha’s all.”
“But I’m afraid to go home.”
“Buy another.”
“I’ve only three bob. How much have
you?”
Combined finances showed scarcely
enough for the purchase of a turkey-leg ;
the imminence of penury advised them
homeward.
They walked falteringly east into the
big, red face of the risen moon, and
Gredden showed the heart of Rachel and
would not be comforted.
So at last having talked themselves out
of arguments to cheer, they faltered
silently on the descending grade of a cut-
down street, till, by the wall of a house
high above them, Gredden stopped and
said miserably:
“Good-night, boys. I’d better go in
and get it over.”
“What you going to say, Gred?”
“I’ll tell the truth.”
“Get some sense. Don’t tell the truth,
for God’s sake.”
“What else can I say?”
“Say it went bad and you gave it
away,” suggested Junor.
“That’s right,” supplemented Brown.
“And square the old woman by saying
you gave it away to charity.”
“No good—you don’t know her.”
“Gred! You mustn’t tell her it was
stolen in the pub.”
“Madness! She’ll say it was all
through booze.”
They started at the voice of doom from
the darkness of the wall above them.
“Gredden! You beast.”
“Ssh! The old woman,” said Brown,
in that loud aside known in Ireland as a
pig’s whisper.
“Let’s get old Gred out of it, Brown,”
exclaimed Junor. Then, raising his voice
for the benefit of the Nemesis behind the
wall: “It was bad luck, Mrs. Gred-
den. ... Forgive and forget! The spirit
of Chris’mus.”
“Spirit of Chris’mus,” the lady repeated
scornfully, “spirit of Chris’mus —you
drunken hounds. Come in, y0u.... and
you two go away or I’ll send for the
pleece.”
Gredden the martyr looked the fare-
well he couldn’t speak, and, as Brown and
Junor left without dignity, he opened his
gate and ascended the steps to Judgment.
“Poor Gred!” said Junor as, departing,
they heard the sound of his welcome
home. “It was like the noise butchers
make chopping meat.”
“Frightful woman! Frightful woman!
Poor old Gred won’t hear any golden-
throated bird singing ‘Love! Love!
Love!’ to-night.”
“She’ll give him ptomaines from the
ham-and-beef shop to-morrow.”
In the nick of time they dodged a fur-
niture-van loaded with louts and beer,
its passengers roaring the “spirit of
Chris’mus,” and defiling the night with
their obscene noises.
The alcohol had gone cold in Junor
and Brown. Lifting their feet as if they
had been to Broken Hill and carried a
ton of lead in each boot, they took their
melancholy way down the hill towards
the moon.


EARLY AUSTRALIAN ART—PRIVATE VIEW DAY.


YELADU
BY T. INGLIS MOORE.
HIS eyes were set on the roan steer as
if he did not see it. Yet I saw a
line of red spring up on its flank
where the lash had bitten deep. He was
flaying the steer with an absent-minded
callousness that would have been strange
in anyone, but was startling in Big
Harry.
As it joined the mob again, he dropped
back beside me, his bay mare still snort-
ing, plastered with lather. His eyes lost
their glaze as he caught me staring at
him.
“That roan’s just the same color as the
Burrawong bull,” he muttered. “I
thought fer a minute I was back” —he
broke off and never said another word
the rest of the day. His lips were set
hard above his brown beard, and his eyes
held things that made questions impos-
sible.
That night we put the mob in the pad-
dock at Mulligan’s Flat and boiled the
billy down by the she-oaks. Afterwards
Big Harry rummaged in the pack saddle
and brought out a bottle. As we drained
the pannikins, the rum, warm and ting-
ling, seemed to melt the silence, and the
stockman nodded.
“That’s good.”
He stared sombrely into the fire. As
we smoked, the river beside us burbled
peacefully over the lapstones and gurgled
into crannies of tree-roots by the bank.
Big Harry reached for the bottle again,
and the second nip loosened his tongue.
“Y’re wonderin’ why I belted the roan
steer, ain’t yer?” he said.
“It didn’t seem like you somehow,”
I agreed, and waited.
The big stockman grunted apprecia-
tion. “Yer kin keep yer mouth shut,
Roy, when a lot o’ others I knows of
would be waggin’ their long tongues
askin’ questions by the dozen. That’s
why I like yer. An’ that’s why I’ll tell
yer somethink. I’ve never let on to a
livin’ soul. But it’s been on me mind
since that roan started me off this after-
noon, an’ I reckon it would do me good
if I got it off me chest fer once. Yer
“I once knew a fellow who could lift a horse in his arms. What do you think
of that?”
“He’d be a handy cove to take a cow down to the show.”
don’t know Burrawong Valley, do yer?”
“No—heard of it, that’s all,” I said,
and got my back comfortable against the
she-oak to listen. Big Harry didn’t like
to be interrupted when telling a yarn.
“Well, me an’ Jim Martin were on old
Palmer’s run then —Koolong, a big
sprawlin’ place that carried around four
thousand sheep an’ three or four ’un-
dred ’ead o’ cattle. It was a good job,
fer the boss was up at ’is ’omestead on
Gooriland most o’ the time an’ left
everythink ter me an’ Jim. We’d been
mates a goodish while, which was strange,
seein’ ’e was a sheepman really, though
a good ’and with cattle, too. I believe
it was arguin’ the toss about sheep an’
cattle that made us chum up. Jim never
liked beasts much ; reckoned they were
treacherous, while sheep were only just
cunnin’—when yer knew ’em. Well, ’e
was right in the end, though ’e never
knew it.”
Big Harry pulled at his pipe as he
stared into the flames.
“One time we’d been over to Mool-
adgee with a mob o’ sheep an’ were rid in’
back ter the run along the Burrawong,
just below Gorman’s selection. We
struck Sandy Kerr at the Crossin’, an’
stopped ter ’ear the news. We barneys
a bit, then Sandy says, ‘Did yer ’ear ol’
Gorman’s girl’s back?’
“ ‘Didn’t know ’e ever ’ad one,’ says I.
“ ‘Yairs. But ’er mother died over ’er,
an’ the ol’ man took a set on the baby.
’ls sister up Goulburn way reared ’er.
But she’s just got married an’ sent the
girl back. Bella, ’er name is.’
“ ‘ ’Ow old?’ says Jim.
“ ‘About nineteen,’ says Sandy with a
grin ; ‘just the right age fer yer, Jim! ’
“ ‘l’ll give ’er to Harry,’ Jim said. We
wouldn’t ’ave all laughed if we’d only
known! Sometimes I think it’s a good
job we’re not all like them Claras—
what do yer call ’em? —the women who
kin tell yer on Monday mornin’ what’ll
’appen ter yer next Saturday night.”
“Clairvoyants,” I said.
“That’s them! Still I reckon life
wouldn’t be any use if we ’adn’t any
shocks an’ surprises. Well, we soon got
a surprise. Fer after we’d left Sandy
an’ gone on a bit we came round a bend
of the river on to Gorman’s Pool. An’
there, plank in front of us, standin’ on
a rock shakin’ the water out of ’er drip-
pin’ black ’air, with not a stitch on, was
a girl—the girl ’erself, Bella Gorman.
“The sun just struck over the oaks an’
lit ’er all up, warm an’ glowin’, with a
kind o’ ’alo all over ’er. A man only
sees a sight like that once in ’is lifetime!
Then she dived inter the water with
’ardly a splash—just like a diver poppin’
’is brown ’ead down noiseless when ’e
’ears yer. An’ afterwards Jim told me
’e’d exactly the same thought as I ’ad.
“We both remembered Old Man Gor-
man’s father ’ad married an abo. woman.
Yer could spot it in the old man, an’ ‘is
three boys were all on the darkish side.
But yer couldn’t tell it much in Bella ;
she was white ail right. Just the feet —
flat, yer know, the skin a bit creamy, an’
a kind o’ quick, easy way o’ movin’ ’er
body, with a sort o’ sway to it.
“An’ she’d a way o’ lookin’ at yer out
o’ ’er black eyes that made yer remem-
ber yer was a man. That was a Tuesday
when we saw ’er at the pool, an’ we
didn’t say much ter each other that week,
On Sunday it was my turn ter ride ter
the post office, an’ I polished up a bit
extra. Not much, fer I saw Jim quizzin’
me. After yarnin’ at the post office, I
rode down the river ter Gorman’s an’
found Jim just ’itchin’ ’is ’orse ter the
fence.
“When we got back ter the shed we
’ad it out. We ’ardly said a word, an’
reached across the table fer the salt and
damper kind o’ proud like. We were
“I refused to marry Bob three months ago, and he’s been drinking ever since.”
“That’s what I call carrying a celebration too far.”
sore at one another, yer see, an’ then we
were sore at ourselves at bein’ sore, if
yer kin get what I mean.
“Then Jim spoke up, ’im bein’ the
quieter but ’avin’ more sense.
“ ‘Are yer goin’ regular ter Gorman’s?’
“ ‘I am! ’ I says, a bit fierce.
“ ‘Then we’ll take turns,’ ’e says. ‘That
girl’s not goin’ ter come between you
an’ me, Harry.’
“So we shook ’ands on it an’ courted
Bella turn about. Then Sandy Kerr told
me ’is wife ’ad ’eard things about Bella
bein’ a bit free up Goulburn way.
After the third round ’e spat out a tooth
an’ admitted ’e must ’ave made a mis-
take. But me an’ Jim didn’t ’ave much
of a life tergether, fer we couldn’t ’elp
thinkin’ o’ Bella all the time—she was
the sort that got inter a man’s blood—
an’ we’d each be wonderin’ ’ow the other
was makin’ out with ’er.
“We relieved our feelin’s by swearin’
at Dingo Jack, cussin’ that blackfeller up
’ill an’ down dale till ’e began ter look
pretty ugly at us at times. The boss ’ad
taken ’im on ter give us a ’and while we
were doin’ some extra work fencin’ out
along Daley’s lease. Then Jim caught
’im over at Gorman’s talkin’ in a friendly
way ter Bella an’ told ’im ’e’d belt the
slats out o’ ’im if ’e ever caught ’im
there again. But Bella fired up —she ’ad
a temper, yer know —an’ told Jim that
she’d never speak ter ’im again if ’e
didn’t mind ’is own business. ’Er grand-
mother bein’ a gin made us a bit scared
that she might go native. If it’s in the
family, they do sometimes, yer know.”
I thought of a saying I had heard from
a drover in a Roma pub. “Once a
black, always a black. It sticks in the
blood.” But it didn’t seem the right
thing to mention to Big Harry just then.
“Bella ’ad a row with ’er old man
about it, too, an’ ended up by tellin’ ’im
to ’is face that ’is own mother was black
anyway, an’ old Gorman went plumb
mad. It was funny ’e couldn’t stand the
abos., though ’e was ’alf a one ’imself.
P’r’aps that was why.
“Well, as yer kin easily guess, all this
didn’t make matters smooth over at Gor-
man’s, an’ Bella’d ’ardly look at us when
we went there. But, as I said, she was
the sort that ran in yer blood, no matter
what was in the back o’ yer mind.
“We were in the middle o’ cuttin’
down scrub ter feed the sheep just then,
an’ one night Dingo Jack slipped off with-
out a word. Blackfellers are like that,
yer know; get restless an’ clear out,
sometimes without even waitin’ ter draw
their wages.
“Bella seemed ter be pretty restless,
too, an’ ups an’ tells us she was thinkin'
o’ goin’ off ter Goulburn again fer a job
she’d ’eard of.
“The next day I says to Jim, ‘What
about askin’ Bella an’ ’ave done with it?’
“ ‘Just what I want,’ ’e says. ‘But who’s
goin’ ter ask ’er first?’
“ ‘Let’s draw a poker ’and,’ I says.
“’E ’esitates a bit. ‘lsn’t that kind o’
disrespectful ter Bella?’
“That stuck me fer a minute. I ’adn’t
seen it that way.
“ ‘Best two ’ands out o’ three, then?’
I says.
“ ‘Right,’ says Jim, an’ looked pleased
as Punch when ’e drew two kings ter
my pair o’ sevens. The second ’and ’e
drew one ter a flush, an’ I drew three ter
a pair o’ jacks. He missed the flush an’
I won with the knaves. I dealt the last
’and, an’ we both took three. We looks
at one another ; then Jim puts ’is cards
down.
“ ‘Two pairs, queen ’igh,’ ’e says.
“ ‘Sorry,’ says I, an’ laid down a full'
’ouse.
“ ’E stares at the cards a bit, then jerks
out ‘Good luck,’ an’ went outside.
“We seemed ter be peggin’ pretty even
with Bella, though she, bein’ lively, joked
with me more than Jim, who wasn’t any
talker. But yer kin never tell with
women. When I asks ’er that night,
Bella looked at me ’ard an’ didn’t an-
swer, while I stood there with me ’eart
bangin’ agin me ribs.
“Then she says slowly, ‘What about
Jim?’
“ ‘lt’s ’is turn next,’ I says—‘if there’s
another turn!’
“ ‘There is,’ she says, an’ I turned on
me ’eel an’ jumped on the ’orse. I was
sorry fer that chestnut next mornin’. It
isn’t fair, yer know, the way men take
out o’ dogs an’ ’orses what they can’t
do ter women.
“Well, Bella took Jim, an’ after a big
spree I drifted round fer a bit.
“I didn’t intend ter go back ter Burra-
wong, but work was ’ard ter find just
then, an’ when I got a letter from Jim
sayin’ the boss wanted me back, with a
P.S. scrawled at the side, ‘Yer could ’elp
me musterin’ that mixed lot out on
Lovatt’s Creek,’ I figured it was time ter
’ead fer the old shed. I missed Jim.
When y’ve been mates with a man fer
years, y’re kind o’ lost workin’ without
’im.
“I was right glad ter be back with Jim.
I’d been a bit scared about seein’ Bella
again, but she seemed like a stranger
though I’d only been away about six
months. Funny ’ow yer care fer some-
one, an’ then, when yer meet ’em later,
yer ’ardly know ’ow ter pass ’alf a dozen
words friendly. I’ve seen it with chaps,
an’ that’s the way it was with me an’
Bella, though if anyone ’ad told me that
six months before I’d ’ave laughed at
’em.
“But it didn’t take me long ter see that
Jim an’ Bella weren’t pullin’ in ’arness


tergether. She’d get fits o’ the sulks an’
nearly snap ’is ’ead off —fer nothin’ at
all. Jim reckoned it was because she was
goin’ ter ’ave a baby, an’ I allowed ’e
might be right. Fer marriage seemed ter
’ave kind o’ changed ’er. She’d been
bright an’ jokin’ before, though, as I said,
she’d a temper, too. Sandy Kerr, who
could always be depended on ter tell yer
that sort o’ thing, told me she’d a ’ell
of a row with ’er old man an’ they
weren’t on speakin’ terms.
“Then one day the boss rode along
ter muster some steers out in the back
paddock, bringin’ Dingo Jack along with
’im ter give us a hand. The steers were a
wild lot that ’ad been left a good while,
an’ with ’em we brought in a roan bull
that ’ad been missed the last couple o’
“I trembled all over when he kissed me.”
“Really? He doesn’t look as if he could kiss that way.”
“He can’t; but his wife was looking.”
musterin’s —got down in some out-o’-the-
way gully, I suppose, or strayed a bit.
We’d the devil of a time gettin’ ’im in
with the mob, an’ ’e charged the dogs
every time they came near ’im.
“We got in ter the shed late that night
an’ put the mob in the yards. Early in
the mornin’ I was just cornin’ round by
the tank when I ’eard a row in the
kitchen. Jim ’ad found Dingo Jack there
talkin’ ter Bella, an’ ordered ’im out,
fer the sight o’ the feller reminded ’im
o’ Bella’s dash of abo., an’ he was touchy
on the point. The black sassed ’im a bit,
an’ Jim booted ’im right out the door,
cussin’ ’im ’ard, an’ ’e slunk off, lookin’
ugly. An’ just as I comes in I saw Bella
lookin’ at Jim like a thundercloud, for
she was touchy about this abo. business,
too, yer know, an’ seemed ter take any
cussin’ o’ the blackfeller kind o’ personal
like.
“She’d just started ter go fer Jim when
we ’eard a terrible bellowin’ from the
•yards, an’ me an’ Jim rushes out. The
roan bull ’ad ripped the insides clean
out of a red Durham steer, an’ was
tramplin’ ’im, too. ’E must ’ave charged
’im sideways. I got the gun an’ finished
the beast, an’ the boss came along an’
swore like a bullocky. ’E said ’e’d shoot
the bull, but Jim argued agin it, an’ the
boss let ’im ’ave ’is own way. As I said,
if we were only like those Claras an’
could see things ahead, what a difference
it’d make!
“I was glad when we finished break-
fast that morning’, fer Bella ’ad the worst
fit o’ sulks I’d ever seen ’er in, an’ spilt
Jim’s tea all over the table the way she
banged ’is cup down in front of ’im.
“We worked all the mornin’ brandin’
the steers an’ nickin’ a few yearlin’s we’d
got from the ’ome paddock. We’d left
the roan bull ter the last yardin’, an’ the
boss reckoned we’d better not try ter
throw an’ nick ’im, but just put ’im
through the crush an’ brand ’im. ’E was
in the big yard, pawin’ the ground an’
lookin’ as ugly as any beast could. I
went ter open the gate inter the small
yard leadin’ ter the crush while Jim
slipped over the fence ter drive ’im in.
“Funny ’ow yer kin remember some
things so plain. I kin still see those two
yards with their six-railed fence, an’ the
gate with half its bottom panel broke
off, leavin’ a jagged edge. The crush
with its rails inside all shiny where the
beasts ’ad rubbed ’em, with bits o’ hair
stickin’ in some splinters. The waves o’
heat risin’, an’ the dust kicked up all
over the yards, an’ the knives an’ oil an’
legropes, an’ the strong smell o’ the burnt
hair an’ flesh, an’ that funny smell yer
get from the ’ot cow dung on the ’andles
o’ the irons stickin’ in the fire. Outside
in the paddock the steers an’ yearlings
standin’, angry an’ puzzled an’ frightened.
An’ inside the Burrawong bull pawin’
in the dust an’ glarin’ round with red eyes.
Yairs, an’ the boss standin’ in the crush-
yard, with ’is leggin’s an’ blue shirt an’
whip in ’and.
“Just as I started ter open the gate,
Bella came along with a billy in one ’and
an’ some mugs in the other. Sometimes
she’d come inter the yard when we were
brandin’, so I waved me ’and ter ’er an’
yelled, ‘Keep out! That bull’s a killer!’
“She looked at me a bit funny like fer
a second, then she walked along an’
started talkin’ ter Dingo Jack, who was
’uggin’ the fence just there. ’E said some-
thin’ in abo., an’ she used it, too, noddin’
’er ’ead at the yard, where the bull was
pawin’ the dust an’ Jim stood ready with
’is whip. I kind o’ got all this out o’
the corner o’ me eye an’ with ’alf an
ear, just before I opened the gate, but
I noticed it on account o’ bein’ annoyed
some’ow at ’earin’ ’er usin’ the black-
feller’s lingo.
“Jim started ter drive the bull, but ’e
only tossed ’is ’ead, angry, an’ didn’t
budge an inch.
“‘Be careful* there, Jim!’ shouted the
boss, who was standin’ near the crush.
‘Keep near the fence! ’
“Jim nodded careless, but ’e watched
that bull with ’is eyes skinned. ’E laid
the lash on ’is back, an’ ’e pawed agin,
but ’is ’ind feet stayed planted square.
But the next time ’e felt the whip sting
’e swung round towards Jim, lowerin’
’is ’ead an’ shakin’ it from side ter side
as if pestered by flies. ’E looked terrible
dangerous, an’ it was enough ter scare
anyone that was, especially a woman.
“ ‘Jim! ’ Bella’s cry sort o’ shrilled
out.
“It startled Jim, ’im not knowin’ she
was there, an’ ’e took ’is eyes off the
bull ter look quick at ’er standin’ over
by the fence. It was just a second, but it
was then the bull charged. ’E was al-
most on top o’ Jim before yer could say
‘Jack Robinson.’ Jim leapt fer the fence
—too late.”
Big Harry paused and looked queerly
at me. “Ever seen a man gored?”
I shook my head. “No. Saw a farmer
tossed once at Gulgong, but he got off
with three ribs broken.”
Big Harry stretched out his hand.
“Pass me that bottle.” And he took a
stiff nip of the rum. Then he rose and
put some wood on the fire, and stood
kicking at the logs.
“The bull got Jim just as ’e got the steer
that mornin’—sideways. ’E trampled ’im
before I could get ter ’im. I don’t re-
member anything but seein’ a red mist
in front o’ me. I just knew I ’ad ter
drive that beast off Jim. I was like a
beast meself. It came back ter me ter-
day when that roan steer broke. ’E was
the dead spit o’ that Burrawong bu 11....
“Well, I must ’ave used the whip terrible,
fer the blood ran from cuts over the
eyes o’ that bull so that—by what the
boss told me after—that murderin’ beast
fell back blinded as me an’ the boss car-
ried Jim out o’ the yard. Just as we got
ter the gate, ’e gave a little moan, an’ a
big shudder ran right through ’im —I saw
it finish, I tell yer! An’ ’e died in our
arms, there, just in the gateway. When
the boss lowered ’is ’ead, I could only
old mine an’ stare at what ’ad been Jim.
“Then Bella was standin’ beside me,
gaspin’ an’ makin’ kind o’ gurgling noises
—through ’er nose, they were. Then she
dropped like a log. But I left ’er there in
the dust while I went an 5 got an ’orse rug
an’ laid it over Jim. Then me an’ the.
boss carried ’er ter the shed. It took us
about an hour to bring ’er round. An’
all the time that beast was roarin’ an s
bellowin’ down in the yard.
“The boss started ter go out an’ I
knew what for, an’ said, ‘No, let me do
it! Jim was me mate.’ An’ ’e .gave me
an understandin’ sort o’ look.
“Me gun was in the kitchen, an 3 I re-
member pickin’ it up, slow an’ deliberate,
but stupid. I was numb all over, as if
I’d been froze. It was a Winchester re-
peater an’ I kept pullin’ the trigger till
I woke up ter find I was just clickin’ it
over an’ over. Five bullets were already
in that bull. The other bul-
let I’d put inter the Durham
red, yer know, just before
breakfast, but it seemed years
before.
“Bella was groanin’ pretty
bad, an’ the boss left me ter
look after ’er while ’e gal-
loped off ter fetch a woman
an’ the doctor. I looked
round fer the black ter send
down ter Gorman’s, but ’e’d
slipped off, an’ I never set
eyes on ’im agin. But when
the boss got back ’e told me
’ow ’e’d thought about old
man Gorman an’ ridden
down ter tell ’im about Bella.
An’ the old cuss —’e was ’ard
as nails —wouldn’t come an’
see ’is daughter. Reckoned
’e was through with ’er.
Afterwards I guessed the
reason, but I didn’t then.
“The women were away
from the ’omestead, as it
turned out, but the doctor
came from Kalbagar. A
funny little bloke ’e was, with
specs, an’ a shiny, bald ’ead.
’E was a bit scientific —used
ter write fer the Sydney papers on birds
an’ things, an’ ’ad written a book about
the abos., too, who were a fad of ’is.
“It was a good job ’e came when ’e
did —which was about seven o’clock —
for Bella’s time ’ad come early. Jim
wasn’t the sort o’ thing fer a cornin’
mother ter look at, an’ she ’is wife, too.
When the doctor came, she was ravin’.
’E told me ter keep out o’ the road, just
bring ’im things at the start, yer know,
but I ’eard ’er callin’ on Jim! An’ she
kept on mutterin’ some abo. words over
an’ over until I thought they would drive
me crazy. The funny part was that one
word sounded curiously familiar some-
’ow, but I couldn’t remember where I’d
ever ’eard it.
“I hope you’re keeping that typist of yours in her place.”
“Well, I take her out to LUNCH, darling”
“That night about twelve Bella’s baby
was born. I went an’ knocked on the
door.
“ ‘Wait a minute,’ the doctor called out
quick, an’ I ’eard ’im movin’ about
inside the room.
“When I went in Bella was lyin’ in
bed with ’er eyes closed an’ ’er mouth
half open, an’ I thought at first she was
dead, till I saw the sheet just move with
’er low breathin’. ’Er black ’air looked
blacker than ever agin the pillow, an’
’er face was kind o’ muddy yellow —
somethin’ like a river after a flood ’as
started ter drop a bit.
“As I looked at ’er, she opened s er
eyes an’ stared at me feeble, not knowin’
me. Then she said in a chokin’ way,
‘Harry! ’ But ’er voice was terrible scared
an’ ’er eyes were like a rabbit’s caught
in a trap.
“Where’s the baby?’ I asked the doc-
tor. ’E was standin’ by the bed, lookin’
a bit as if the strain ’ad been too saucli
fer ’im too, I thought, ’e was so washed
out. Now ’e pulled out a handkerchief,
took off ’is glasses an’ started ter polish
them. Then ’e jerked ’is ’ead towards a
bundle wrapped up in a blanket on a
chair just beside me.
“ ‘There,’ ’e said. ‘lt was born dead.’
“Poor Bella, I thought; Jim an’ the
baby gone tergether. An’ I looked at
the bundle on the chair. Then, without
thinkin’, just naturally, I suppose, as
everyone does, I looked at the doctor an"
asked ‘Was it like Jim?’ an’ lifted the
blanket ter ’ave a look.
“The doctor just kept on rabbin’ ’is
glasses an’ didn’t say anythink. But
there was no need. That baby—l can
see it now.
“I stared at it stupid fer a minute.
Then I dropped the blanket as if it were
red-’ot, an’ walked over ter the bed. An"
when ’er eyes met mine, Bella saw that I
knew who was the father o’ that brat.
She just gave one little cry, tried ter sit
up a bit, then fell back, ’er face workin’.
Then she went still.
“The doctor put ’is ’and down under
the coverin’s, then bent down an’ list-
ened.
“ ‘ls she’ I didn’t like ter finish
it.
“ ’E straightened up slow an’ nodded
solemn.
“An’ some’ow that put somethin’ else
inter me mind.
“ ‘Doctor,’ I says, blunt an’ sharp, fer
me insides were turnin’ over, ‘you know
the abo. lingo. What does “yellardoo”
mean?’
“ ’E looked at me ’ard, ’is bald ’ead
shinin’ by the glow o’ the lamp.
“ ‘ “Yeladu ,” ’ ’e says in a scientific
tone, exact an’ certain. ‘That’s coastal
dialect. It just means “Now.” ’
“ ‘ “Now,” ’ I said, almost whisperin’,
for I’d remembered why that yeladu
word sounded familiar when Bella said
it over in ’er ravin’ an’ where I’d first
’eard ’er say it. An’ I stared at Bella
dead there in the bed. But what I was
seein’ was ’er standin’ by the fence at
the yards with Dingo Jack an’ noddin’
at Jim an’ the bull—just before she called
out ter Jim.
“An’ I remembered, too, the look she’d
given Jim as she’d banged ’is cup down
on the table that mornin’, spillin’ the tea,
an’ I looked back an’ understood every-
thin’
Big Harry stopped, and the burbling
the rlver suddenly grew loud in the
S 1 ce '
Then together we reached for the
pannikins.
“Time ter turn in,” he said abruptly,
“We’ll ’ave ter be up at sunbreak ter get
the mob down ter the Big Waterin’ Ole
in good time.”


ABORIGINALITIES
“Colon”: The youngsters were discuss-
ing “gun” loads of wheat when Uncle
James broke in with a snort. “Gun loads,
me eye ; why, y’ don’t fill a bag nowadays.
Now when I was your age we did have
bags, somethin’ a man could ram six
bushels into —we used to sew wool bales
on them for patches. I remember lumpin’
for old Brown o’ Memalong one year.
Had to work in me bare feet. When I
took the weight o’ the bags on me back
me feet used to spread and burst the
uppers of me boots.”

“Lofty”: A young Englishmen took up
one of the soldier-settler blocks on Kong-
bool, Balmoral (Vic.), in 1920. It was
in the middle of a dry spell; grass was
scarce, and the sheep were getting

poc*r. One of the district cockies ad-
vised the settlement superintendent that
she-oak leaves would keep the jumbucks
on their feet, even if it didn’t fatten them.
The super, passed the word round per
’phone, and that afternoon I met the
newchum with his spring cart piled high
with old she-oak logs. I mentioned that
she-oak logs were great burners. “Burn
’em, be domned,” said Choom. “I’ll be
cuttin’ ’em oop to give the sheepies their
supper.”
* * * *
“Erua”: Mrs. ’Possum, who for many
moons has lived under our rooftree, had
been extraordinarily noisy for some
nights. A visiting naturalist explained
that she was engaged in the annual rite
of discarding her offspring, who, well
past the flapper stage, was being directed
by mother to get a roof of her own.
Daughter duly departed, but the overhead
commotion was unabated, and in a
desperation induced by loss of sleep we
engaged the local plumber to eject the
old lady. He arrived in a doubting mood,
and announced that before he began
operations he would have to consult the
police. The police were distinctly dis-
couraging, remarking coldly that ’possums
were protected, and to injure or kill one
might mean a substantial fine. The per-
turbed plumber returned and said that as
a last resource he would consult the
“cruelty people,” a poetic name for the
S.P.C.A. They were even more emphatic
than the police. The combined uneasiness
communicated itself to us, and we dis-
missed the plumber with costs. Mrs.
’Possum is still in the roof, and from the
banging and thudding that go on in the
dark hours she seems to realise that her
position is impregnable. Daughter, we
discover, has taken a flat over the wash-
house.
* * * *
“Isee”: In the Mount Auriol mess of
the Westies, Sierra Leone, a few years
ago, the entertainment of a visiting brass-
hat had an unusual feature. When dinner
was announced and the party filed in,
one place was vacant. The mess presi-
dent made apologies to the guest of
honor for the lateness of their “only lady
guest.” Curiosity was rife as to her
identity, but the visitors were totally un-
prepared for the astonishing vision that
appeared. Clothed in a decollete golden
ball gown, which revealed her lovely
hairy arms and neck, a female chimpan-
zee entered and climbed into the vacant
chair. She behaved like a lady through-
out the meal, with just one exception.
Finding all her bread gone, she stretched
her big hairy paw across the table, and
helped herself to the bread on the plate
opposite. She took the soup with a
spoon, her veges. (previously cut up)
with a fork, and she drank a tumbler of
water. Major Liston had captured her as
a baby, having to bottle-feed her at the
time. During the five or six years follow-
ing she became very docile, and was not
caged or chained up. She could make
her own bed and dress herself (this was
accomplished after a few dresses had been
torn to bits). The major had an idea of
taking her to England to put her on the
stage, but she died of pneumonia.
“Cubbie”: Bullock skeletons wedged in
trees (B. 29/11 / ’33) are a commonplace
in many parts of western Queensland,
though there they are due to floods and
not snowdrifts. In the flat country along
the Balonne between St. George and the
N.S.W. border the network of rivers and
billabongs spreads out in roaring flood,
miles wide. As the water subsides the
bodies of sheep and cattle are left, especi-
ally near the main channels with their
giant gums, 30ft. or more from the
ground. In my day, when the inevitable
newchum asked the inevitable question,
he was always told that the sheep or
bullock had got there by climbing up to
eat the gum leaves when starving in
drought time, and went away much edi-
fied and impressed with the wonders of
nature.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: A South African journal
received the other day reported a charge
of “earth-smok-
ing” against a
K a ffi x. The
queerly - named
iniquity is the in-
halation of smoke
from the leaves of
the “dockka,” a
close cousin of
Indian hemp or
bhang. The Boer
republics, equally
with the Cape
and Natal, im-
posed heavy
penalties on Kaf-
firs convicted of
the offence, the
reason being that
the practice was
apt to send a
native danger-
ously mad. I
once got a Kaffir
horseboy to show
me how it was
done. He cut a
tiny trench in the
ground, gnd in
this laid a twig
of pliable karoo
so that a piece
projected above
ground at each
end of the trench,
which he then
filled in and
stamped down.
After letting the
earth set he
gently withdrew
the twig, leaving
an underground
passage connect-
ing the two holes
a foot apart. Into
one hole, en-
larged a little, he
crammed dried dockka leaf, on which
he placed a coal from the fire. Then,
lying on his breast, he sucked in the
smoke from the other hole —and that’s
how the forbidden business comes to be
called “earth-smoking.”
* * * *
“Ben Nevis”: “Scotty” Currie, a
Papuan trader who had travelled widely
(he lost all his toes and 'fingers through
frostbite on a polar expedition), had his
most thrilling experi-
ence when going
down the Lakekamu
River in a double
canoe. “Scotty”
lazed comfortably in
a deck-chair on the
central p 1 a tform,
holding a large um-
brella to shade him
from the fierce tropic
sun. Eight native
boys, two at either
end of each canoe,
paddled the craft.
The peaceful river,
the lap-lap of the
paddles, the warmth
of the sun, soon
sent the passenger to
sleep. He suddenly
awoke to find the
boat was not mov-
ing. Looking up he
found the four front
boys had dis-
appeared. Looking
behind he found the
others had deserted
also. No wonder.
Horrified, he stared
into the gaping jaws
of a whopping big
crocodile immedi-
ately behind him. It
was half out of the
water, its great scaly
head and forelegs already on the plat-
form behind his chair. “Scotty” made
one wild leap, and fortunately landed on
the bank.

“8.L.W.”: A block of land at Myall
Creek station (N.S.W.) has been given
for the erection of a church, possibly in
reparation for a blot on the early history
of the State with which this station was
intimately associated. In 1838 it was
the property of Henry Dangar, whose
hands had mostly been convicts. The
local tribe of blacks accused these
employees of ill-treating their women.
Finally, the station men invited the
blacks to a conference at the station.
Twenty-eight men, women and children
attended. On arrival they were hustled
into the stockyards, and ruthlessly done
to death, all except one child, who
crawled into a hollow log. Eight men were
subsequently arrested, taken to Maitland,
tried and —acquitted. However, at a
second trial, at which Chief Justice Dow-
ling presided, seven of them were con-
victed. They were hanged at Darling-
hurst Gaol.
“Mind you, sir, it’s a mistake to light those cigars a second
time.”
“I knew that the first time I lighted one.”
“C. Coral”: The supposedly down-
trodden Papuan lady has certain effec-
tive ways of bringing erring husbands
to reason. Not long back a fuzzy-headed
gentleman was discovered to be on too
affectionate terms with another lady of
the village. The wife did not waste time
in verbal argument. She simply took a
firestick, set it to her abode, and went
home to ma. When Lothario returned
he found a pile of ashes and a couple of
pick-heads were all that remained of his
happy home.
* * * *
“Homfrey Beale”: The banana domi-
nates with multifarious symbolism the
life of the male Papuan of many tribes.
When a male child is born its arms are
upraised by the parents, and by their
proxyship it utters the prayer: “O
Banana, grow for me.” Periodically this
invocation is repeated with much
earnestness on his behalf. At a tender
age he is taught the various banana
liturgies; approaching adulthood, he
is initiated into the ceremonies that
stress the importance of the banana
and the dire ill that results from any
disrespect towards it or flippancy in the
utterance of its name. A wedding at
which the contracting parties are not
well feasted with ripe bananas is sure
to be disastrous. Wrongdoing is pun-
ished by banana deprivation, the disgrace
of which is far more agonising than the
resultant stomachic void. Even when
dead a man is not finished with bananas,
for, represented by a banana stump sur-
rounded by goods from his estate, he
must give a posthumous feast to his
friends if he would escape a future where
everyone is on the dole.

“Dai R.”: Governor Game had a bit
of the real Mackay in outback experi-
ence when his car got bogged in the lig-
num country round Brewarrina, which
has a reputation vying with that of Rotten
Plain. It is a good five miles across, and
beneath the surface is a mass of lignum
roots, the capillary attraction of which
draws and holds all available water. A
few years ago “Happy Jack” Hawkins
and two other teamsters had to pool
their collective strength of 72 horses to
shift eight tons of the Beemery clip
across it.
THE OLD SMITHY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It faces the street of a little bush town.
Long years has its furnace been still;
Great cracks are agape in its weather-worn
walls
Where white ants are working their will.
The iron roof leaks when a thunderstorm
comes,
And flaps when the westerlies play;
One doorway is filled with the frame of a
plough
And one with the wheel of a dray.
Where shutters have fallen and lie in the sand
A window gapes wide like an eye;
The signboard is twisted and turned by the
wind
And tilts till it faces the sky;
Tall nettles and thistles creep in through the
chinks
Where sand from the roadside has blown,
And midst the floor-sweepings and slivers of
hoof
The slimy, pale toadstools have grown.
The fringe of an apron that hangs from a peg
Is stiff as the teeth of a rake;
A plaited hide halter, looped fast to a rail,
Lies twisted and coiled like a snake;
The bellows are wheezy and eaten by ants,
Their leather sides wrinkled and black,
And mice scuttle in through the spout at the
front
And out through a hole at the back.
An old circus poster is tacked to the wall
And printed reports of a show,
With pictures of horses, along with a list
Of prizes they won long ago.
Bold letters and scrolls are burnt into the
seats,
Old cattle brands, blackened and deep,
And quaint, painted tracings in colored designs
Of tar-brands for marking the sheep.
A small wooden bunker beside the old forge
Is warped with a burden of slag,
Where tresses of cobwebs hang down from the
roof,
Like the wispy grey locks of a hag.
And in a snug corner, where winds do not
reach,
A patch of the floor has been swept
And gumleaves and straw have been strewn
for a bed
Where some weary traveller slept.

“Hamer”: One of the developments
of flat-dwelling Sydney is the communal
dog. Our flat owns one which I thought
belonged to the proprietor until he sold
out, leaving the dog behind with the fur-
niture. Old tenants tell me that nobody
know where Old Jack came from ; every-
body feeds him; he goes for walks with
any tenant who will tolerate his com-
pany, and does his barking on behalf of
the community. It occurred to me that
this business of being everybody’s dog
and nobody’s might have some dis-
advantages, so, inspired by the sight of
Jack scratching himself industriously on
the lawn, I brought home some dog-soap
and got busy. Old Jack submitted quietly,
but there was a reproachful look in his
eye. Next day I caught Jackson perform-
ing the same service, and the look in
Old Jack’s eye was more reproachful
than it had been with me. I was telling
Jackson that I had washed the dog myself
only the day previously, when Andrews
put in the information that he had washed
the animal that same day, and Martin,
so he had discovered, had done it also.
Later on Wilkins asked me whether I
had seen Old Jack ; he had brought some
dog-soap home, he told me, and intended
to give him a bath. But Old Jack was
missing and stayed missing for several
days. He is back again now ; but if he
sees anyone with soap in his hand he
makes himself scarce at an astonishing
speed.

“Wandara”: Touching those census
figures relating to Queensland’s abo. and
half-caste population (B. 22/11/’33),
allowance must be made for the way in
which some of the district returns are
made up. For instance, the Torres Strait
islanders are under the administration of
the Queensland Aboriginal Department,
and, though they are not mainland abori-
ginals, some officials, to save time and
“Thirsty weather, isn’t it ?”
“Parching. I’d like to know where that blasted leopard gets his spots.’
trouble, classify them all as such. Actu-
ally a large percentage are half-caste or
of mixed blood. I saw one statistical
return on which the whole population
of an island was returned as “abo.,” but
the following year the proper differen-
tiation was made. This would account
for a decrease of a hundred or so
in the “abo.” column and a correspond-
ing increase in “half-castes.” The Com-
monwealth Government, at its last cen-
sus, adopted the classification of “Torres
Strait Islander” to distinguish the inhabi-
tants of those islands (where they were
not actually half-caste) from mainland
“abos.,” and it is a pity that Queensland
hasn’t a similar sensible definition. A
good many T.S. island inhabitants have
the franchise, by the way.

“Spare Roseberry”: What is the Aus-
tralian record for ploughing a lonely
furrow? It is at present claimed by the
brothers Offner, of Dubbo (N.S.W.),
who took a contract from the Railway
Department to plough firebreaks be-
tween Dubbo, Nyngan, Canowindra and
Barbagil. They did the job: 850 miles
with a six-furrow plough in 44 working
days at 30s. per mile.
jj> * * *
“Cowildi”: A Canberra assertion that
no abo. has ever been hanged in North
Australia is a grotesque travesty of the
facts. Certainly Perkins wasn’t in office
when Copio was hanged at Darwin for
killing a Chinaman, but there were plenty
of other instances. An earlier execution,
when one Wandi was topped off for lead-
ing a murderous attack on some Malay
trepangers, did not produce the effect ex-
pected. To impress the abos. with the
white man’s might, all the darkies that
could be nobbled in the countryside were
brought in to witness the ceremony.
They declined to be impressed, bursting
into roars of delighted approval, and
pushing forward another native with a
request that the funny business be done
over again, with the newcomer playing
the principal part. Blankets and tobacco
were distributed amongst the spectators.
A month or two later a deputation
arrived from the wilds to ask when the
Government was going to stage another
hanging—it was explained that Jacky
Jacky was right out of tobacco, and
could do with more blankets.

“GG6”: Though the statement that
the goanna in western Queensland is
addicted to tunnelling dam embankments
is not borne out by my observations, I can
endorse “B.J.’s” contention (B. 29/11/’33)
that he is fond of fresh mutton
when opportunity offers. In some parts
of the flood country in south-western
Queensland bogged sheep are a problem
in the dry season, when the billabongs
and the flood swamps, known thereabout
as “briaries,” are drying up. Pulling
out the unfortunate animals is one of
the beastliest jobs a station hand has to
tackle. In a country where the gos. are
thick it is aggravated by the fact that a
big proportion of the poor brutes have
been, literally, eaten into from behind
while helpless in the sticky mud. A cut
throat is the only remedy.
* * * *
“Canis”: Notwithstanding the sceptics,
“Kaleski’s” theory that the dingo is the
daddy of all dogs (B. 29 /11 / ’33) has the
backing of all accepted zoologists. He
is the living image of the wild red hunt-
ing dogs of Africa and Central India,
though, unlike them, he does not make
a practice of running in large packs, and
his lines are a little finer. There is little
doubt nowadays that the dingo reached
Australia from Asia, when the land
bridge through Malaya was still above
water. How it was that he alone of all
the Asian fauna came south of Wallace’s
line and left the tiger, the elephant and
the rhinoceros on the other side of it is
a matter of conjecture. It seems most
likely that he arrived as a semi-domesti-
cated beast with the human invasion.
Before the white man descended on Aus-
tralia the aboriginal drew his dog sup-
plies from the wild dingoes, just as his
remote forerunners probably did from
the Asian wild red dogs.
“Could you show me somethin’ ’t ’d do Dave fer a Christmas present?”
“What about a nice silk shirt or a new tie?”
“ ’Ave a bit o’ sense, man! Wot’s the price o’ yer milk-buckets ?”
“Pat Bushie”: While roaming a
wooded area near Lismore (N.S.W.), I
came upon a large spider web with a
small tit in its meshes. The spider was
working frantically to put a web wrap-
ping about the unfortunate little bird.
I dispatched it and freed the captive.
The web strands were almost as strong
as horsehair.
* * * *
“Keeta”: “Deah Me’s” comment (B.
22/11 / ’33) on shearing holds taught at
Hawkesbury College shows he doesn’t
know much about longwools. In the
picking up of the foreleg of a heavy
Border or Romney ewe, particularly if
the shearer is a short man, the head and
neck (already tending to lie between the
shearer’s legs, even in a small sheep) must
inevitably, from the very size of the
sheep, go further between his legs. By
maintaining that position from the fore-
leg until the flank is approached, with
the shearer’s feet in V formation hard
against the sheep’s left rump and tail,
very definite advantage is gained. There
is a decided outward bend in the line of
the sheep, giving the desirable tightly-
stretched skin ; the sheep is then in a
more nearly perfect balance than at any
other time during shearing, the shearer
does not have to support the heavy-
weight, and there is no kicking. Owing
tc the excellent balance there is no tight
gripping of the head or neck. As the
flank is approached, the head is, of
course, brought back from between the
legs, and the shearer, stepping back a
little, completes the hind leg in the usual
way.
* * * *
“Quad.”: Boswell records that two rein-
deer were imported by Sir Henry Liddle
for his estate in Northumberland, but
they died. Now, two centuries later,
seven have been taken from
Lapland to the Pyrenees. If
they adapt themselves there
perhaps someone with an ex-
perimental mind and a long
purse will give the steeds of
Santa Claus a chance on
Kosciusko or Maoriland’s
Southern Alps.
“Pick”: On the cattle stations of cold
Monaro (N.S.W.) in olden days they
reared horses that could buck and men
who could tame the worst outlaws. Each
rider, then, evolved his own fanciful
style in the saddle. Jack Lloyd used to
stand in shortened stirrups and balance
neatly every lurch of his fractious mount.
The only rooter that got the better of
Jack was a sullen brute that threw him-
self down and rolled. Os. Wrightson’s
method throughout a tussle was a mon-
key crouch, with his hands assisting to
keep the equilibrium. In a fierce flurry
he would traverse the arched back to
which he clung, from withers to tail and
back again, but the mightiest heave never
quite spilled him overboard. “Jack the
Horsebreaker’s” ambition was always to
retain a seat like a Lancer on parade.
He feared- only the tender-mouth that
reared and fell backward.
* * * *
“Runa”: Some lads camped in a small
bay on Lake Rotoiti used to swim to the
opposite shore and back. One morning
they started off as usual, to discover when
they had gone a short distance that the
water was decidedly warm. In a few
strokes it became hot, and suddenly they
were faced with the prospect of being
parboiled if they continued their swim.
They turned back hastily, only to find
that they were in the midst of a large
area of hot water, which appeared to be
getting hotter every second. They swam
furiously to the nearest point of land,
escaping serious injury, and looked back
on an expanse that was actually steam-
ing. Probably a hot stream under the
lake bed had broken through. The bay
resumed its ordinary temperature within
a few hours.
* * * *
“Advance T.”: In B. 15/11/’33 the
climate of Townsville is compared with
that of Singapore. There are differences.
Townsville is in a dry belt, having, as a
rule, nine months’ drought each year.
In Singapore it rains nearly every after-
noon. In Townsville the hatless brigade
sticks to its colors throughout summer,
whereas in Singapore it is necessary to
wear a solar topee or a double felt hat.
Townsville’s temperature seldom exceeds
90deg. After living in various latitudes
in Queensland I place Townsville first
for pleasantness of climate.
* * *
“Creel”: “Tamornie” (B. 15/11 /’33)
is incorrect in stating that the axolotl
(which, incidentally, is a Mexican name
meaning “to play in the water”) can
produce offspring only while water-dwell-
ing. This was the universal belief until
it was proved otherwise at the Paris
Aquarium a few years ago. When about
two years old some of the creatures kept
in captivity “underwent a transforma-
tion,” so the report reads, “both in
appearance and habits. Their external,
feathery gills and the membranous ex-
pansions of their tails and backs gradu-
ally dwindled away, until finally they
left the water as lung-breathing creatures
in the form of the amblystoma. In due
course some of these transformed sala-
manders produced young, thereby reveal-
ing that the axolotl will breed in both
its mature and immature form.” It was
also discovered that feeding the axolotls
with thyroid gland compelled them to
change into land-dwellers, in the same
manner as they do when the supply of
water in which they are kept is gradually
reduced.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Against the red of sunset’s glow
The ibis go a-winging
To where unsullied waters flow
And unknown winds are singing;
By ridge and crest and sandy plain
Across the open spaces,
Into the infinite Beyond,
The ever-lonely places.
Ah, would that I might know the power
That, when the day is dying,
Would lend me wings for one short hour
To follow in their flying!
Then might I greet with them the dawn
That comes with rosy fingers
To lighten up the vast Unknown
Where still enchantment lingers.
But Earth has bound her masters long
In unrelenting fetters,
And, though they sing the lilting song
Or string the rhyming letters,
Their song must seem a halting Jhing
To those whose spreading pinions
Have carried them beyond the ken
Of little ways and little men
To Nature’s vast dominions.

PEACE ON EARTH
By J.H.M.ABBOTT
TOWARDS the end of the year 1837
Major Hubert Abercrombie, of
H.M. 50th Regiment of Foot (the
West Kents), was Commandant of the
penal settlement at Norfolk Island —he
served in that capacity from 1834 to
1839. He invited his old friend and
comrade-in-arms the Baron Augustus
Von Big to visit the island and remain
there for two or three months.
The Baron landed at Kingston at the
end of November, and lived in bachelor
companionship with Major Abercrombie
until the last week in February,
when he returned to Sydney. The sub-
joined extracts from his hitherto unpub-
lished “Memoirs” give some account of
his sojourn in the settlement, and refer
particularly to an incident, that occurred
about Christmastide, which seems to
have left a more lasting impression upon
his mind than anything else he observed
during his stay on the island.
“My friend Major Abercrombie,” he
writes, “having so kindly requested me
to visit him at Norfolk Island, I obtained
permission to do so from his Excellency
Sir Richard Bourke, and embarked my-
self and my valet-de-chambre upon the
vessel which plies regularly with stores
and prisoners between Port Jackson and
that far-flung outpost of her youthful
British Majesty’s dominions.
“Norfolk Island at this time had a
reputation that induced people to men-
tion its mere name with a sort of terror.
It was, indeed, a Hell upon earth, but as
I had heard that it was also naturally a
paradise, and as Hubert Abercrombie —
whom I had known well in Portugal and
Spain during the operations of the Duke
of Wellington between 1808 and 1814 —
was one of the best of good fellows, I
welcomed the opportunity of spending a
holiday there. I had seen the penal
settlements at Hunter’s River (New-
castle), at Port Macquarie and in Van
Diemen’s Land, which were places of
extreme brutality, and was curious to
learn how Norfolk Island had earned for
itself the reputation of being the most
brutal and terrible of them all.
“It was Governor Darling who turned
the island into what it was at the time
of my visit, he having decided upon
making it ‘a place of the supremest pun-
ishment, short of death’—to quote his
own words. To accomplish this so desir-
able end, he sent down there, in 1829,
Major James Morisset, lately of H.M.
48th Regiment, who had achieved
notoriety and extreme hatred as a con-
vict disciplinarian of the severest sort
during his terms as Commandant at New-
castle and Bathurst, investing him with
both civil and military powers.
“Major Morisset had more than real-
ised the Governor’s intentions. Hubert
Abercrombie was expected to continue
as Head Devil and Principal Tormentor
of this community of the damned, and
whatever of mercy and benevolence
towards his unhappy charges might have
been natural to his private feelings he
was compelled to restrain and conceal.
He had, as a matter of the preservation
of authority, to continue the ‘good
work.’
“I landed at Norfolk Island on a sunny
afternoon. Lemons, limes, guavas,
oranges, figs, grapes, bananas, peaches,
pomegranates and pineapples abound
everywhere, and the hills and valleys
are covered with so green a sward be-
neath the pines (Araucaria excelsa ),
which rear their heads in splendid sym-
metry, as to qualify the place to dispute
with Hibernia the title of ‘the Emerald
Isle.’ A coral reef fronts Sydney Bay,
where the settlement is situated on the
south side of the island, and we were
landed in boats through an opening in
it where a massive breakwater has been
constructed and forms a tiny harbor be-
low the high bluff of Point Ross.
“There were considerably more than
1000 prisoners, and of classification there
was none. So long as actual mutiny
is kept in check and a modicum of
labor carried on, the authorities are con-
tent —perhaps only capable of doing so
much—to allow these degraded men to
live as they please. The condition of
things is amazing and horrible.
“On the evening of my arrival the
military surgeon, Dr. James; Captain
Arbuthnot, the officer commanding the
two companies of the 50th in garrison on
the island, and Father Driscoll, the
/ Roman Catholic chaplain, had been in-
vited to meet me at the Commandant’s
table. My old friend turned to me with
a twinkle in his eye, and observed:
“ ‘You will find Norfolk Island, my
dear Baron, quite a charming spot.
Nature has been prodigal of her gifts,
and I don’t know any other place in
the world that is such a Garden of Eden.
We will be able to provide you with
some excellent shooting—the woods are
full of pigeons and other bird life, whilst
the surrounding waters literally teem
with all sorts of fish. But in one respect,
I fear, you will suffer some amount of
privation.’
“ ‘Pray, may I ask, my dear Major,’ I
replied, ‘what this shortcoming may be?’
“‘I allude, Baron,’ he said, smiling
round the table, ‘to the absolute dearth
of female society in Norfolk Island. I
fear I break the news a little brusquely
to you, but there is not a single woman
in the settlement. The omission to in-
form you of this was something of an
act of deception on my part. But, know-
ing you tp be the lady’s man you are, I
was fearful lest we might have been de-
prived of the pleasure of your company
had you only known the dreadful truth.
I beg that you will forgive me, Baron.’
“ ‘Major Abercrombie,’ I said solemnly,
though it was difficult to hold back the
all-too-ready laughter as I regarded the
smiling countenances of the four gentle-
men seated round the table —they were
evidently of the undivided opinion that
Augustus Von Big had been badly sold
—‘l was under no misapprehension what-
ever as to the regulations in force here
with regard to womankind. His Excel-
lency Governor Bourke himself in-
formed me definitely upon the point. It
is a refreshing experience, my dear
Major, to be away from feminine lures
for a couple of months —most refreshing,
I assure you. Pray, do not concern
yourself with the matter at all. I suffer
no deprivation whatsoever.’
“I did not deem it necessary to stress
the fact that this was the literal truth. I
was by no means deprived of female
society, for my valet-de-chambre, passing
through the little celibate world of Nor-
folk Island in masculine attire and under
the name of ‘George Baines,’ was in
reality Fanny Montqgue, a member of
my household at Pampeluna, near Castle
Hill, who had been assigned to my
domestic service from the Female Factory
at Parramatta. Having, before her
conviction in London on a charge of
bigamy, been on the stage, Fanny was
able, being of slim build, to act the part
of a rather good-looking youth of eighteen
of thereabouts to perfection. But I was
to rue my pleasant deception.
“Down to its most trivial details
the island was ruled and regulated by
the cat-o’-nine-tails. Over all —not in
the background, but in the very forefront
of everything—loomed the gallows. It
stood, a permanent structure, outside
the main gates of the prison, or convicts’
barracks, immediately opposite the land-
ing-place. It was the first object
of interest to confront a newly-arrived
prisoner, and by many was regarded with
a species - of affection, as being the only
means by which they could hope for a
release from their intolerable sufferings.
“As I have said, my friend Hubert Aber-
crombie was no tyrant for the sake of
tyranny. He was compelled to be cruel.
Mercy was always construed into weak-
ness, and severity was his only choice.
Major Morisset had established pre-
cedents from which his successor in the
administration of the settlement dared
not depart.
“But in the island itself what joy and
delight was to be found! When I began
to know my way about I took endless
pleasure in exploring its sylvan beauties.
Within the small compass of its pic-
turesque coasts was to be found the
greatest variety of scenic charm. Every
valley and ridge presented to the eye
some new and alluring picture; from
every eminence a glimpse of the blue
immensity of the surrounding waters re-
minded one of the loneliness of this
exquisite gem of the ocean. In the shade
of its dells and glades one might fancy
one’s self in the centre of a continent.
“At first my ‘man’ Baines would
accompany me on these expeditions, and
I found the presence of pretty little
Fanny a decided antidote to the exclusive
masculine society of the island. But in a
few weeks I began to enjoy my own
company most in my walks abroad. That
great poem beginning—
Transcendent isle, old Ocean’s loveliest gem,
Thou stirrest my heart and
began to take vague shape, though it
never progressed any further. I had
to console myself with the reflection that
the best poetry does not get written, but
remains locked in the breast of its
creator.
“On the morning of Christmas Eve I
waited in bed until long past the usual
hour when my valet was accustomed to
bring me a cup of tea, and at length, a
little put out by the delay, got up to in-
quire the reason for such remissness.
Opening the door of the small room ad-
jacent to my own where ‘Baines’ slept,
I was astonished to find that the bed had
not been occupied and that my ‘man’-
servant was absent —a fact which caused
me considerable perturbation. I dressed
and went out of the house, intending to
take a stroll through the settlement to
see whether I could gather any tidings
of the absentee.
“In the garden I came across Peter
Brady, who did various odd jobs about
Government House, being one of those
well-conducted prisoners whom the offi-
cials of the island selected as domestic
servants. The old fellow raised a fore-
finger towards his brow in the character-
istic salute of the convict, and bade me a
respectful ‘good-morning.’
“ ‘Good-morning, Brady,’ I said. ‘Pray,
have you seen anything of my man
Baines?’
“ ‘Not since yester e’en, y’r honor,’ he
replied. ‘About nine o’clock —just after
gunfire—l see th’ young fellie a-walkin’
wid a sojer. Corp’ril Montague, it was,
sorr. I tuk it they was a-goin’ a-fishin’,
for th’ sojer had a rod in his hand. They
was a-makin’ toward Emily Bay—th’ far
side from here. Ain’t he come back, sorr?’
“Telling the old man that it did not
matter, I took a walk along Quality Row,
as the main thoroughfare of Kingston is
called, on account of its containing the
dwelling-places of most of the island’s
higher officials. But I came across no
traces of my missing ‘man.’ In order to
avoid any awkward discussion of my ser-
vant, I made no mention of ‘his’ absence
when breakfasting with the Commandant
a little later, but merely intimated my
intention of spending the day on an ex-
cursion into the interior of the island
on a shooting expedition.
“‘I hope you’ll enjoy good sport,
Baron,’ said my host. ‘l’d go with you
myself, only that I’ve got to put in the
morning at the courthouse, dealing with
some of my unfortunate charges. I hope
you’ll have a pleasant day. You don’t
need a guide, I suppose?’
“I assured the Major that by this time
I was quite well able to find my way
anywhere in the island, and at the con-
clusion of the meal set out on my search
for the absentee. In was a glorious
morning, and Norfolk Island was at its
best.
“About noon I came out of the forest
at the head of Ball’s Bay, a little cove on
the eastern side of the island, and here
my search came to an end. Beneath
the spreading hoizontal lower boughs of
a giant pine, lying on a carpet of green
turf, I came upon my missing valet
in the arms of a soldier.
“Both were fast asleep. The man wore
two chevrons on his sleeve, and I knew
that he must be Corporal Montague.
“Leaning upon my gun, I stood and
looked at them sternly, wondering what
I had better do. This sort of ill behavior
on the part of my valet-de-chambre could
not, of course, be tolerated. It was not
to be endured. I had not brought Fanny
Montague from Parramatta for the enter-
tainment of members of the island garri-
son ; but what was to be done? Clearly,
I could not complain to the Command-
ant, nor to Captain Arbuthnot.
“Whilst I stood there debating with
myself in puzzled fashion, Fanny woke
up.
“ ‘Ah, Baron,’ she said, smiling up at
me in her pretty way as she gently re-
leased herself from the arms of her red-
coated lover, whose shako rested on the
turf beside him in an inverted position—
‘l have found my first husband. Will you
not congratulate me?’
“At that moment the soldier opened
his eyes, and he was smiling also—until
his eyes rested upon the avenging
Nemesis (myself) that had overtaken the
guilty pair. Then he scrambled to his
feet, resumed his headdress, came to
‘attention,’ and saluted me. At once my
proper course of action was revealed to
me.
“ ‘Baines, my man,’ I said sternly to
the young woman, ‘you have been absent
without leave. You will immediately
return to Government House and resume
your duties. My good fellow,’ I said to
the corporal, ‘pray remain here. I desire
a few words with you. Now, then,
Baines—be off with you at once.
Instantly, I say!’
“The girl saw that I meant business,
and, pouting a little, disappeared into
the forest. I turned again to the soldier,
who was much more frightened than
was Fanny.
“ ‘What the devil,’ I said to him, ‘do
you mean by such conduct?’
“A good-looking young man, he was,
with a frank and open countenance. He
stared at me for a few seconds without
speaking, evidently at a loss for words.
After gulping once or twice, he presently
found his tongue.
“ ‘That—that young woman, sir—she’s
me lawful wife.’
“‘ The devil she is /’ I exclaimed in
amazement.
“ ‘Yes, sir,’ he nodded—‘we were mar-
ried in Chatham five years ago. I knew
her as soon as I saw her, sir—in spite
of her being rigged out in men’s clothing.
When I was sent to Port Jackson with
the regiment, sir, she got lonely-like an’
married another man. There’s some of
’em like that, sir.’
“I knew that very well —none better.
I nodded my head to him to go on. But
he had little more to tell me.
“‘I hope you’ll be indulgent to us,
Baron Von Big,’ he said in a pitiful way.
‘l’ve forgiven Fanny—on your account,
you know, sir. Will you not also forgive
her, and help us to be happy? My detach-
ment is to be relieved when the Governor
Phillip returns to Sydney. I shall be able
to purchase my discharge, since I came
in for a small legacy some little time
back, and then we can set up in busi-
ness somewhere in the colony—l was
thinking of Bathurst, sir Oh, y’r honor,
I beg ye to be lenient with us. I implore
ye, sir!’
“ ‘H’m,’ I said sternly. ‘I will con-
sider the matter. You had better go back
to the barracks. Are you also an
absentee?’
“ ‘No, sir; I have twenty-four hours’
leave —to go a-fishing.’
“ ‘Ach ! It seems to me, my man, that
you fish in troubled waters. Return to
Kingston, then —and come and see me
to-night, after dinner, at Government
House. That will do, my man. You may
go.’
“He, top, vanished amidst the giant
pines. I sat on a rock at the head of that
exquisite little bay to consider my course
of action whilst I smoked a pipe. At
length my mind was made up, and, after
eating some sandwiches I had brought
out, and having drunk some brandy and
water I carried in a flask, I also found
my way back to the settlement.
“ ‘My dear Baron,’ said Hubert Aber-
crombie later in the afternoon, ‘I knew all
about the girl almost from the week of
your arrival. She came and told me.
She had recognised her husband when
he was corporal of the guard here at
Government House, and was afraid to
tell you. Baron,’ he said, shaking his
forefinger at me, ‘you are an incorrigible
sad dog! ’
“ ‘Of course,’ I said. ‘I know that.
But what’s to be done?’
“ *We must remember, Augustus,’ he
replied with a smile, ‘that it’s Christmas-
tide. Peace on earth, my old friend —
peace on earth. There will be none of
it if you punish this young man Baines—
or if I expel you from the island, with
ignominy, for a breach of the regula-
tions, as soon as the brig appears in the
roadstead. For the sake of peace on
earth —and on account of goodwill, also
—we must play the play out. George
Baines continues to valet you ; Corporal
Montague carries on with his duties. You
remain my very welcome guest until the
three of you return to Sydney in the
Governor Phillip. That is all, my dear
fellow—all that we can do for the sake
of peace on earth and goodwill toward
men. If we do aught else, there’ll be a
devil of a fuss. Yes, my dear Baron —
before everything else, the only possible
policy. Peace on earth!’
“But this was not quite the end of the
affair. On the road that leads from
Bathurst to my estate at Salamanca
stands an inn of some pretensions to
comfortable accommodation for the
traveller in those parts. Here it was that
I felt constrained to establish Mr. and

“Fanny had represented to me that the
real story of Baron Von Big’s visit to
Norfolk Island was an extremely interest-
ing one, but that it need not necessarily
become common property. I saw her
point, and the signboard of the inn bears
its name in red paint—‘The Peace on
Earth’ —over the green representation of
a Norfolk Island pine.”


THE CROOK
BY RODERIC QUINN.
THE two men trudged on, Alison in
the lead. Miles back the track,
eroded by winds or overlaid by sand,
had petered out. This track, on leaving a
lone outstation two days before, they
had been directed to follow. They were
told that it went west, west always, till
it reached an isolated mining camp
about a hundred miles from their point
of departure. Since the track was no
longer visible, they were now trusting
themselves to the guidance of the sun.
They had started out with two water-
bags. One was empty now. The full one
Alison carried ; the other, since there was
no way. of replenishing it this side of
their objective, and because every useless
ounce of burden made for heavier going,
Alison’s mate had discarded. As he tossed
it away he had said:
“Well, that’s that. There lies half our
hope of getting through.”
Alison nodded, but made no remark.
Instead he wondered how far the water-
bag had carried them, and whether the
half-hope it had contained meant half
their journey done.
Thirst gripped the muscles of their
throats like relentless fingers, and weari-
ness leadened their feet when at sunset
they camped. Beside a flat-surfaced rock,
red and weatherworn, they threw them-
selves down, and, eyes set on the west,
waited for darkness and the cool of the
earth, which it would bring. The water-
bag Alison placed on the grooved and
splintered top of the rock. There, each
of them resolved, swallowing hard as he
made the resolution, that it should re-
main untouched till the next day’s march
had been well begun. Presently the sun
sank, reminding Alison of a bright cop-
per coin, new from the Mint.
The rest that the earth had yearned for
all through the day came to it with the
twilight and the first of the stars, and,
like a cool hand on a fevered forehead,
the dewy air revived the spirits of the
two men.
Side by side, arms stretched, legs
stretched, they felt the tiredness pouring
forth from their pores, as though they
were ridding themselves of a weakening
poison—of a poison that sapped the
strength of mind and body alike. When
darkness fell they became aware of the
existence of a great silence, such a silence
as only appeals to the consciousness
when night releases the senses from day’s
distractions. Because the peril of their
position was an inescapable thought with
them both,'they spoke little, not caring,
each for the other’s sake, to make men-
tion of it. It was a topic too painful to
dwell upon.
Alison and his companion had been
mates for two years, and to them mate-
ship had meant more than friendship,
more even than kinship. The tracks, the
roads, the routes of a wide land had
tried their fellowship and had never
found it at fault. Where one went, there
went the other, too ; and where one ate
or drank, there the other did not go
hungry or thirsty. Each trusting each —
each feeling that he needed the other
to make himself complete—never did
they allow the lure of gold or wine or
women to come between them. And
never once did one grow curious to know
the manner of life which the other had
led prior to their meeting. Each counted
the other’s past as sacred to himself
alone.
And now, lying Side by side under the
stars in the wide, wild, desolate open, it
was not so much of himself as of his
mate that each was thinking.
Most of the night they lay awake, com-
pelled to do so by the pain of their
parched throats. But, at times, sleep
visited them, briefly, fitfully, bringing
them dreams of blue mountain pools,
rippling creeks, running rivers and fall-
ing rain. From the torment of such
dreams they would awake to the torture
of reality, and, tossing from side to side,
wish they had not slept. When the dawn
came flooding with pearly light a sky,
all too clear of clouds, they struggled
to their feet.
“Let’s push on,” said Alison, “while
the air is still cool and the going good.”
He went to the rock to retrieve the
waterbag. Then, motionless as a man of
stone, he whispered, “Oh, my God! ”
“What is it, Alison?”
Alison turned and stared at his mate,
stared as though he did not see him,
stared as though he saw Death instead ;
and when his mate reached his side he,
too, stared as though he saw Death.
Before them lay the waterbag, its can-
vas side pierced by a sharp splinter of
rock. A wet patch on the surface of the
rock showed where half its contents had
leaked to waste.
“That settles it,” Alison said.
A long time after, having thought
much in the interval, his mate replied,
“Yes, perhaps—and perhaps not.”
“Perhaps not, be damned! ” snarled
Alison in sudden fury. “What hope
have we of getting through to the settle-
ment now? Forty miles, maybe fifty
miles, of Hell’s own country to cross
and only a measly sup to carry us
through.”
“One might do it, Alison, and bring
help to the other.”
“A pretty chance,” growled Alison.
“Still, a chance.”
Alison leant against the rock in the
growing glow of dawn till some thought
coming to him made his eyes bright.
“Perhaps you’re right,” he said ; “per-
haps there is a chance. Here, take the
bag and get going—get going in a hell of
a hurry if you’re to do any good for me.”
“No!”
“Then what?”
“We’ll leave it to fate, fortune, chance
—to the toss of a coin.”
“Well,” said Alison, “have it so.”
“How do you like the new hymnhook, Mr. Pendinnick?”
“I think they improvements be no better—in fac’, I think they be worse.”
Alison’s mate drew a coin from his
pocket.
“The best two out of three wins,” he
said. “Who wins, stays ; who loses, takes
the water and goes. Up she is, and heads
she is.”
The coin spun in the light of the new-
risen sun, and, still spinning, fell at their
feet.
“The luck’s mine, and up she goes
again and heads she is again!” cried
Alison’s mate.
The coin fell with a soft thud at their
feet, and Alison, stooping over it, saw
that he had lost.
The sun was more than man-high
above the horizon when Alison, having
made his mate take a swallow of water
from the shrunken bag, said, “Keep your
heart up, old man ; I’ll be back with help
sooner than you think.”
Then, following his shadow to the
west, he left his mate, thrice turning ere
a ridge of sand intervened to wave a
farewelling hand to the lone figure lean-
ing against the rock and grimly grinning.
Mile after mile Alison forged on,
urged by all the manhood and mateship
within him to do his utmost to save the
friend who had given him a last chance
to save himself. Matching himself against
the sun and sand and spinifex, he fol-
lowed on and on till his shadow, grow-
ing less and less, at length slunk behind
and followed him.
Since starting forth he had taken but
a few mouthfuls of water, had drunk of
it sparingly because he regarded it as
doubly precious now, since two lives de-
pended on it. At times, halting on some
little elevation, he searched the horizon
for a sign of the mining camp —searched
it with little hope —and hopelessly
resumed his trudging.
He camped in the bed of a dry creek,
his head pillowed on a mound of sand.
He slept little, and the little that he slept,
haunted by dreams of his mate as he had
last seen him leaning on the lone rock
far behind, brought him no refreshment.
When he resumed his journey he
noticed that his waterbag was lighter now
and easier to carry. Grimly he reflected
that at least that was something to be
thankful for. Before the day ended it
would be less of a burden still, and per-
haps not worth the trouble of carrying
at all. Still, good things might happen,
good things for his mate and himself,
before that came to pass. In an hour or,
maybe, in two hours, or in three hours
at the most, from the top of the next
sand-ridge or the ridge beyond it, he
might sight the settlement and find water
there —wells and tanks of it.
Well on in the afternoon he became
momentarily aware that he did not know
where he was going or what he was
doing. Vaguely he remembered that he
had drunk the last drop of water and that
he had cast the bag away. That must
have been some hours ago, he thought,
and some miles behind. Since then he
had wandered on and on, but had he
wandered in the right direction? Was
he going west in the way he should go, or
was he going east? Should he be follow-
ing his shadow, or should his shadow be
following him? Was it forenoon or
afternoon?
Strangely puzzled he sat down, and,
elbows on knees, sought to think the
matter out. But somehow he could not
think, could not set his mind to work.
The sun, pauselessly pouring down
heat through the stirless air on to arid
earth, bred strange fancies in him. His
eyes felt like two fierce coals. His throat
was parched, but his tongue ailed him
most of all. It seemed to be hugely
swollen, filling the whole cavity of his
mouth, and it was direfully dry —dry as
a sponge whose every pore craves and
aches for moisture. All this the sun
with its cursed heat was doing to him.
As time went on a strange thing hap-
pened. He not only felt the heat but
saw it. To his eyes that seemed like two
fierce coals it became visible. It took the
form of little red tongues, forked like the
tongue of a snake. These tongues seemed
to fill the air and search the earth for
moisture, darting and leaping from un-
seen mouths and for ever questing
hopelessly.
To get away from the horror of his
vision he rose to his feet and staggered
forward with not enough sense within
him to care whither he was going. Some
hours afterwards, before consciousness
utterly failed him, through eyes that
burned like two fierce coals he glared at
the sun. It stood on the horizon and
seemed like a copper coin—a coin no
longer new from the Mint, but tarnished
by much usage.
“Here, drink this.”
Alison awoke. A man tall and sun-
burned was bending above him. His
head, upraised, lay in the crook of the
man’s left arm. At his lips was a panni-
kin of water.
He drank, and as he drank the man’s
eyes looked searchingly into his. Then
something seen there caused the man to
breathe deeply and straighten himself up
as though relieved of a burden.
“You’re yourself again, at last, old
man,” he said.
Coming out of a strange bewilderment,
as though issuing from a fog, Alison
looked about him. Beneath him was a
stretcher, above and on either side the
canvas of a tent.
“Where am I?” he asked.
“We’re miners,” the man replied, “and
you’re at our mine, the Lucky Find—and
lucky to be there. Take another sip.”
Alison did as he was bidden.
“Thanks,” said Alison ; “but how do
I come to be here?”
“We found you, myself and my mates.
There was just a flicker of life in you.
The spot where we picked you up is a
good ten miles from here, and you took
some carrying, dead-weight all the way.”
Alison was silent for awhile. Then
he remembered something—a rock and
a waiting mate —and, half-rising, put a
sudden question:
“When did all this happen—yesterday?”
Sensing the anxiety in Alison’s voice,
the man gravely answered:
“You don’t realise how bad you’ve
been. A sunstroke must have got you
and brought you down to the last kick.
You’ve been in a hell of a delirium for
the last three weeks, and you’re mighty
lucky to have come through it.”
“Three weeks? My God, my mate!”
Afterwards, when the first fierce stab
of the moment had ceased from paining,
he told his story to the camp, and the
camp having heard it did their best to
comfort him.
“Well,” said one, “your mate was a
white man.”
“And,” said another, “he was a white
man’s mate.”
And the third said, “ ’Twas fine and
sportsmanlike of both of you to put the
issue to the toss of a coin.”
Then with red rum in their pannikins
they drank a toast to the spirit of mate-
ship and to a good man gone.
Some months later up the track—dis-
cernible now in places as a result of the
action of a scouring gale that had lifted
the overlay of sand from its surface-
padded a camel-train, laden with stores
for a hinterland station. At the head of
the swaying, ungainly train rode Abdul
Khan on a big grey bull camel. Raven
black was Abdul’s beard, and his eyes,
long used to gazing down desert dis-
tances, as black as new-hewn coal. Be-
hind him on a second beast, less of
stature than that which carried Abdul,
rode Barton, bookkeeper of the station
towards which the camels were heading.
Somewhere about noon they came to
the flat-surfaced rock beside which
Alison and his mate had camped. There
the camel-train halted for a breathing
space, the two men dismounting to
stretch their legs. And there, stretching
their legs, they rounded the rock and saw
the dead man. Arms outflung, face
turned to the skies, blackened by the sun,
naked to the waist, he lay in the dwind-
ling shadow of the rock.
Shocked to silence by that which lay
at their feet, for a tense moment they
stared down on it and said nothing. Then
breathing hard, and like one who spoke
to himself, Barton muttered, “Poor devil
—how he must have suffered!”
But Abdul the Afghan said nothing,
hardened by years of wandering in desert
places, this was not the first time he had
chanced upon a man done to death by
thirst.
“Abdul, we must give him decent
burial.”
The Afghan nodded.
“And, Abdul, there may be something
on him—some letter, some trinket, some
little thing to tell us who he was.”
Kneeling by the dead man, Barton
searched his pockets—searched one and
found nothing, searched the other and
drew from it a single penny—all it con-
tained. Holding this between finger and
thumb, he showed it to Abdul.
“Poor devil, he was down on his luck
all right—down and done and out.”
Turning the coin casually he looked at
it in bewilderment. He turned it again.
The hardness of steel stole into his
eyes, and, rising and retreating from the
prone figure at his feet as though the
sight of it, the touch of it, was contamina-
tion, he showed both sides to Abdul.
It was a penny with two heads.
Abdul could not understand why a
double-headed penny should stir Barton
to such a fierce revilement of one who
was dead and beyond the hurt of words —
for Barton was hissing:
“He got what was coming to him, the
fraud, the crook! His swindler’s luck
deserted him at the last. Come, Abdul,
let us leave this place at once.”
The camel-train moved off—such
things having been said of Alison’s mate
by Barton, the bookkeeper, in the hearing
of Abdul, the Afghan.


ENIGMA.
By.E.MARy GURNEy.
SARA, the old Romney ewe, lifted her
head and gazed intently towards the
far end of the paddock, where the
land went down in a gentle slope to the
cress-bordered creek; for the new life
she carried within her was leaping to-
wards birth, and she knew that her hour
was near.
Shaking her head impatiently, she began
to walk towards the creek. All around
her, in the darkness, was movement: the
short, crisp tearing of grass between sharp
teeth, the quick, harsh grind of cud-
chewing, and every now and then a
heavy sigh from some replete and reclin-
ing beast. From the scented night the
dim outline of trees broke suddenly,
merged with the shadowed darkness
again as she passed. Overhead a myriad
stars gleamed frostily.
Nearing her destination she paused
once or twice, bleating deeply in her
throat, thrilled to the core of her being
by the age-old mystery of her coming
motherhood. Down the slope to the
creek she staggered a little, with the
agony of her labor. Beneath a rush, she
sagged to her side and lay with her head
pressed to the earth and her wide eyes
glassy and unseeing.
A small wind lifted, sighing from the
north, all pungent with the scent of earth
and the loveliness of growing things. It
stirred the hidden treetops, making them
sing little secret songs of love and birth
and death, old as the world is old, and all
things that are born of it.
Presently, behind the tussock, there
was sound ; faint at first, but gradually
increasing—muffled tread of heavy hoofs
and the crunch and tear and gusty breath-
ing of a grazing cow. In a while she
came round the tussock and blew great,
cloudy breaths at the motionless sheep :
but, as though divining her sister’s ex-
tremity, passed on peacefully to her gusty
feeding.
In the hour before midnight Sara be-
gan to struggle in the torments of her
labor, but it was not until the silent hour
before dawn that her young were de-
livered —two husky rams, one brown- and
one black-faced. As she licked and
suckled them it seemed to Sara that the
very stars were singing the wonder of
her motherhood.
And then dawn rushed up, in a pale
glamor of primrose and gold, and the
trees leaped from the darkness and were
caught in a loveliness of light.
All across the green field, sparkling
with dew, the flock of sheep were dotted,
sitting busily chewing or moving with
slow regularity as they grazed; and the
inky depths of their long shadows threw
them into sharp relief, so that the white-
ness of their fleeces was startling by
contrast.
“Not that I'm one to TALK, hut it's the second time to-day that bee has visited
Dulcie Daffodil.”
Sighing with satisfaction, Sara nosed
her awkward, lop-eared offspring and
knew that they were the most beautiful
things on earth. They lunged at her
with thin, ridiculous bleats, and tugged
furiously at her dripping udder, wiggling
their absurd tails while she sniffed them,
as anxious as though this selfsame
miracle had not occurred to her every
year for the last three years.
With a continuous low bleating she
turned towards the creek, and, after a
short hesitation, the lanky, gangling
lambs went after her, proceeding in a
series of short, staggering runs. She had
to keep turning aside to avoid trampling
on them.
At a little bay, covered with green
scum, she drank deeply, nosing the weed
aside with dainty lips and sipping the
cool water delicately.
Presently Black grew tired of waiting
on the bank, and tumbled down it into
the water, where he floundered, bleat-
ing dismally 'at the icy shock of it.
Had he been less robust he would have
drowned without ever regaining his feet.
But Sara’s stock were strong, and in a
while, in spite of the mud, Black was
on his feet in six inches of water, shak-
ing himself indignantly and filling the
morning with his thin, baby anger.
Sara stood on the bank, nosing Brown
and calling anxiously. Black paid no
heed, but kept up a monotonous bleating
on his own account —not shrill, but pene-
trating as the scream of wood dying
under a buzz-saw. Once or twice Sara
descended to the creek and touched her
nose to his. Thereupon he ceased his
bleating with the suddenness of an
engine shutting off steam, and wiggled
his yellow tail; but he stubbornly refused
to follow her, merely bleating with re-
doubled vigor immediately she turned
away. On the third occasion Brown fell
down the bank after her and received
an involuntary christening, too ; but, be-
ing kept by his mother’s bulk from roll-
ing further than the extreme edge, he
scrambled out and solaced himself with
a little refreshment.
In the end, Sara, deciding that one
lamb was better than none, turned defi-
nitely away from the creek and, fol-
lowed by the wobbly Brown, made her
way up the slope.
Once she half-turned back, bleating
strenuously, so that the full light from
the rising sun gleamed in her liquid,
pathetic eyes.
When she turned back to the paddock
Brown was industriously tagging another
ewe, who kept swinging round and butt-
ing at him morosely. Sara lumbered
after him, and it was many minutes be-
fore she could convince him that it was
her udder which was overflowing with
milk and not that of the black-faced ewe.
Down in the creek, the abandoned
Black felt that the end was approaching.
He had yelled for help, and help had
not been forthcoming, so, unless he did
something about it himself, his end
would come in the icy coldness that
was already enveloping. He did what
all his mother’s calling could not induce
him to do—lunged recklessly forward.
More by luck than good judgment, his
head was turned to the shore.
Once on dry land the full realisation
of his abandonment descended on him
and he blundered through tussock and
rush, sending forth his plaint that was
already growing husky with excessive
use.
Half-way down the paddock, where she
had at last succeeded in recovering
Brown, Sara heard him, and abandoned
Brown to go to his succor.
Brown, after one stupefied second, be-
gan to make short rushes this way and
that, bleating his displeasure. By then
Sara had rediscovered Black on the top
of the slope, and had no thought for any-
one but him. But Black refused to recog-
nise her, and continued on his way at'a
staggering jog-trot; though by now his
cries had dwindled to a thin squeak that
died in his throat. Only when he was
exhausted would he condescend to own
the distracted Sara, tugging at her teats
“After all, dear, you can still find cheerful news in the paper.”
“Yes; the dam’ date at least shows that another day’s past.”
as though it was many hours since he
had had sustenance.
Satisfied, he sat down in the sun, and
nothing Sara could do could induce him
to rise again, though she had long since
remembered Brown and was as distracted
about him as she had been over the recal-
citrant Black.
Brown, abandoned to his fate, had
staggered hither and thither after this
ewe and that; and, repudiated by all, had
at length reached the far end of the., field.
There, worn out with misery and terror,
he had collapsed beneath a thistle and
straightway fallen asleep, soothed by the
warm rays of the risen sun.
In the middle of the morning he woke
again, and fell to his interrupted bleating.
Sara, grazing disconsolately beside the
replete and slumbering Black, heard him
from afar ; but, though she argued with
Black, nosing him to his feet and calling
him urgently, he stubbornly refused to
travel far or fast.
This time Sara would not leave him.
Him she could see and hear and smell;
but, though the mother heart of her was
conscious that at dawning she had been
possessed of two young, Black was a
living, tangible thing; Brown was be-
come no more than a disembodied voice
crying in the wilderness. Still she could
neither rest nor feed with that incessant
bleating in her ears, and through the
morning she gradually succeeded in
working Black, who grew more lively as
the sun warmed and dried him, towards
the far crying that was growing faint and
intermittent with sheer weariness.
At noon a man on a horse came into
the paddock. With him were two dogs.
Sara threw up her head, sniffed and
stamped, swung on her heel and hurried
off down the field.
Where were men and dogs, there
trouble was. Not for nothing had she
lived six years, reared three sets of
twins and had them ruthlessly torn from
her.
Black, catching something of her sense
of panic, scampered after her, handling
his black legs with dexterity, though they
still looked as though he were using
something that did not belong to him.
At the extreme end of the paddock
Sara pushed under a stunted manuka
bush, from which she peered out
defiantly.
Up the paddock, Brown emerged sud-
denly from a niggerhead, and, with a
wild bleat of joy, rushed under the
horse’s hoofs, nosing ecstatically at its
legs. So fatuously engrossed was he that
the man was able to dismount and pick
him up before he realised what had hap-
pened. Near and far the man rode, with
the little brown-faced lamb sulking over
his saddle-bow, but nowhere could he
find a ewe with lamb.
They came at last to the solitary
manuka bush, at which one of the dogs
rushed with a “yip” of triumph. Sara
snorted and stamped and made short
rushes at the little bright-eyed collie.
The man got down and tried to approach
her, holding Brown out in front of him,
but Sara circled away from him, keeping
between Black and the dog. Once or
twice, in a mad rush, she knocked him
flying, so the man put Brown down and
retreated. But Brown was sulky and
empty, and lay limply where he had been
placed, and Sara circled and stamped,
sniffing anxiously at Black and ignoring
Brown.
Twice she walked clean over him and
did not see him; but the third time
Brown caught a whiff of the milk that
dripped from her heated udder, and
scrambled up, bleating excitedly. Sara
ran to him with an air of joyous dis-
covery, sniffed him hastily and then
rushed over the top of him at the little
collie, which was sitting on its haunches
half a dozen yards away. She got her
lambs both together and retreated, snort-
ing and stamping, down the creek bank.
When Black and Brown were two
weeks old one of the things Sara had
feared came to pass. The man came one
morning with his dogs and began to drive
towards the gate all the ewes that had
lambed. When she saw what was hap-
pening, Sara called the twins and tried
to dodge back, for she knew that directly
they reached the gateway they would be
separated in the rush.
Always she fought against going
through gateways. Years of defeat could
teach her nothing. Others might plod
indifferently or rush foolishly to their
doom, but never would she. No dog
could hold her. Though her lambs were
often knocked off their feet and trampled
in the scuffle, always she charged blindly
and broke further and further away from
the gateway.
So to-day, in the blistering heat, she
lowered her thin, aristocratic head and
charged again and again, with wooden
obstinacy. After the third rush Black
and Brown were scattered like leaves be-
fore the wind, and their crying was lost
under the crying of half a hundred lambs
and ewes which drifted slowly but surely
towards the gateway, shattering the after-
noon silence with their incessant, appre-
hensive bleating.
Reaching the gate, they milled there,
an insensate mass of panting, incredible
stupidity—milling and finding each other,
only to mill and be lost again. One or
two frightened lambs were forced
through, to be followed by half a dozen
crazy ewes, each claiming them voci-
ferously. Then the rest would mill again,
until some disgruntled old ewe would
give up the search in disgust and plod
through, followed on the run by half a
dozen more.
A lamb broke away and came stam-
peding down the paddock with the dogs
in headlong pursuit, but there was no
stopping it. Straight for Sara it headed,
and she, thinking she recognised one of
her own, rushed, with a bleat of sheer
rage, to meet it.


Fury incarnate, she charged first one
and then the other dog, while the lamb,
utterly exhausted, rolled over on its side
and lay panting.
Sara whistled and stamped at the dogs,
turned and nosed the lamb —it was
neither Black nor Brown —and would
have broken away again down the pad-
dock but that the man came galloping
up on his horse, scattering the unlambed
ewes right and left.
He dismounted, picked up the lamb,
and spoke sharply to the dogs, which
circled wide, tails drooping, noses to the
ground. The man mounted again, spur-
ring his horse in front of the sullen
ewe.
Sara hesitated. In other years she had
played this game out, played it to the
bitter end —to the horror and ignominy
of being caught and tied with flax and
flung on a horse. No matter how she
fought, the end would be the same, so,
with the glimmerings of intelligence, she
turned and ran back up the field towards
the gate, bleating despondently as she
went.
Through it was a young ewe, suckling
her lamb and swinging sullenly in a vain
endeavor to dislodge Black, who cared
nothing where he got nourishment so long
as he got it.
Sara dislodged him by the simple ex-
pedient of walking over him. He fol-
lowed her sulkily, and she, condoning his
temper, forbore to search with any dili-
gence for her other lamb. Brown she
found by accident at dusk, skipping
light-heartedly about a tussock with half
a dozen companions.
Here was a deep lagoon overhung with
raupo and the silvery-gold plumes of the
toi-toi. The surface of the
deep, quiet pool was flecked
all over with scarlet weed.
Sara sat beside the pool
chewing her cud. Her face
had lost its look of obstinate
stupidity and assumed an air
of content. Her large eyes
were softly luminous, and
almost wise, as *she turned
her head from time to time
to gaze towards the little
hummock where Black and
Brown and thirty or so more
lambs played. White in the
moonlight, their dams moved
leisurely to and fro.
At the mouth of the little
creek that emptied itself into
the lagoon a great bullfrog
crept out on a broad leaf and
chanted his spring song,
“wark - wark - wark - wark,”
without pause.
Over at the homestead &
cow began to low, shatter-
ing the calm silence with a
raucous, insistent bellowing.
Far away a bull roared again
and again ; and at the top
of the paddock a colt, newly
weaned, squealed and began
to race up and down the
dividing fence. Presently,
kicking and bucking, he
came round the creek, and
Sara, never doubting that he
would avoid her, only just escaped from
under his plunging hoofs. Straight on
he drove, into the group of playing
lambs, striking right and left as he went,
not in wanton killing, but half in play,
half in anger at the separation from his
dam.
The lambs scattered, but one was too
slow, and, when the colt was gone on his
whirlwind way, Sara’s first-born, Brown,
lay in a tiny bloody heap, crushed back
to the earth whence he was sprung.
As Sara hung about him, bleating ter-
ribly, Black came limping to her from
the darkness. But Sara hung above her
first-born and would not be comforted.
Twice during his short life she had aban-
doned Brown with seeming indifference,
but now that he was dead she would
not leave him. The other ewes called
their lambs and fled away in panic, but
Sara was inconsolable, nor would she
suckle Black.
Presently her noisy grief subsided to a
throaty murmuring, but still she hung
above her dead, with the tang of his
blood rising to her quivering nostrils.
Far and near the disturbed sheep
bleated, and once, far off, a dog howled.
Sara did not hear him come ; only,
suddenly, he was there —a gaunt, wolfish
form in the waning moonlight, with eyes
that were pin-points of yellow fire.
Her head jerked up and her eyes glared
in their awful panic, but she did not
move. Black rose from his seat beside a
tussock and limped close to her, to press
against her woolly side, but she gave him
no heed. It was not for him nor for her-
self that she was afraid, but for the
stiffening form of her first-born.
The great dog circled her, snarling. As
yet he was no killer, but he was hungry
and angered, having smelt blood, that
rhe ewe should still guard her dead.
Sara circled to face him, trampling the
dead lamb and knocking Black over, be-
cause, handicapped as he was with his
game leg, he was too slow to avoid her.
Once or twice the dog made short
rushes, but Sara lowered her head and
charged determinedly. Presently he with-
drew and sat a little way off, snarling
softly.
Black edged up to her, seeking com-
fort. She shook him off angrily, bleating
to the stiff, cold thing that had been
Brown.
The night waned. The Ipan dog rose
and approached again, snarling. Soon
the dawn would be there, and he must go
about his lawful occasions, unfed. Sara
charged blindly, and as she swept past
he dodged and his great jaws snapped,
closing on the wool below her neck. She
was jerked into the air and over.
Up the paddock, a little ghostly form
went limping. There was something
heartbroken in the utter dejection of its
gait, as though it knew itself cheated
and betrayed and was moving on, to pass
away alone, where none might know the
shame of its unwantedness.
When Sara regained her feet the dog
was already standing with one forepaw
on the little white corpse—was tearing
ravenously at the half-cold flesh.
With a cry that was half-human in its
despair, Sara charged again ; but now
the dog was savage with the savagery of
a beast about to be robbed of its kill.
He missed the throat-hold for which he
had leaped, but his teeth closed in the
wool of her flank, tearing it terribly.
Torn and bleeding, Sara dug her little
hoofs in, twisted in mid-air, and drove
forward again, blind with the unreason-
“Where are you going, Jacky?”
“Sydney. Mary say bush too plurry lonely.”
ing fury of her motherhood. Again the
dog reached out and slashed her. He
dragged her down, tasting the hot blood,
seeking to tear the throat —a killer at last.
In Sara the madness died, and she
knew panic—panic blind and terrible.
With a last spurt she surged to her feet
and tore herself free —swerved this way
and that. But, no matter how swift she
was, the dog was always in front of her.
Her blood, her strength, her life were
ebbing. She slogged her head down and
charged once more.
Too late the dog leaped aside. Her
lowered head caught him squarely behind
the foreleg, driving the wind from his
lungs, sweeping him down the sodden
bank and out into the lagoon.
He sank like a stone. Once he came
up, choking and gasping, but he did not
rise again.
Among the weeds at the water’s edge,
whither her last wild rush had carried
her, Sara stood, belly-deep in the clinging
mud.
So spent was she that her head kept
dropping to the water that was already
tinged with blood. Again and again she
jerked it up, but her nostrils were choked
with mud.
In a little while, even as the first bird
sent out his first shy note to greet the
dawning, her head dropped for the last
time.
A little wind swept out of the north,
stirring the moveless treetops and mak-
ing them sing their age-old, secret song
of love and birth and death, of spring-
time and fruitfulness and autumn seed-
ing. It sped over the little lagoon,
ruffling its clear surface into little waves ;
and leaped up the slope through the sweet
grass.
Eve and the Morning'.
BY JAMES EDMOND.
“Reader from the First” writes: “A
Christmas Number without a contribu-
tion from James Edmond would seem
strange. If he left no unpublished manu-
script [unfortunately such is the case],
republish something for the sake of us
old chaps and to show the young fellows
what manner of writer he was. I suggest
that wonderful thing he wrote about
Adam atid Eve in Eden.” Here it is, then.
IT was the fragrant dawning of January
1, in the year One, and Eve opened
her large, sleepy, brown eyes and
looked round thoughtfully on the partly
Mesopotamian and partly Mesozoic
landscape.
A thin, warm mist arose from the soil
and wrapped her in its folds like a gar-
ment bought at the bargain counter of
the drapery emporium of Nature, then
just opened for business. The trees were
tall and green. The earth was green. An
anonymous river which flowed almost at
the First Lady’s feet was blue, and the
anonymous lake that received its waters
was bluish-green. Million-colored birds
and butterflies the size of tents were in
the air.
There was beauty everywhere, and,
above all, the globe, for the first and last
time in its life, smelled new. The smell
of a new globe, fresh from the oven, so
to speak, is something never to be
forgotten by those who have experi-
enced it.
Eve was 23, having been created that
way the day before, with her Hebrew
birth-certificate to prove it. Twenty-three
is the best age for a woman. She was
straight and graceful and strong and
sfft. high, and s|ft. is the best height for
a woman —especially a New Woman.
Eve was the only genuine New
Woman, though vainglorious impostors
have fraudulently claimed the title. Adam
was 27, and his birth-certificate was in
Aramaic to prevent their marriage being
within the prohibited degrees and arous-
ing comment.
The new queen sat up and brushed a
pterodactyl—the makeshift or acting flea
of the period—out of her wonderful hair,
and looked about her. She wasn’t at all
sure that she was satisfied with her lot,
though she had all the lot there was,
barring the bit that was left for Adam.
She had been born, to her great surprise,
in the afternoon, and married at sunset
before she had time to turn round. Al-
ready she wondered in a blase sort of
fashion if she had made the best use
of her opportunities, and if she might
not have done better. She was frankly
bored.
Later she learned that there were 600
years to be bored in, for she lived to a
great age, retaining her beauty to the
last, and she no longer hurried to bore
herself. Later, too, she realised that she
had unexpected things to be grateful for.
It was given to her to be the pioneer
woman —to invent sin, to invent mar-
riage and to invent being a woman. The
patents of all these inventions have
expired, particularly the first one.
Mrs. Eve suffered from a certain
amount of bodily discomfort to aggra-
vate her mental state. The new four-post
bedstead of leaves had proved hard and
lumpy, and there were red marks on
parts of her produced through lying
down on parts of her that no woman had
ever lain down on before. The counter-
pane of boughs was quite insufficient,
and her feet had been sticking out all
night. So had Adam’s, and Eve re-
marked critically that her husband would
require a large size in boots when boots
came to be worn.
She almost decided that the bedroom
was stuffy—an unreasonable idea, for it
had neither walls nor roof, and, in any
case, Adam had left both windows open
the previous evening. Incidentally, the
bride resolved that her first move in the
intricate game of life would be to make
herself a nightdress.
Some of the larger and more polite
mammals and a partially reformed lizard
of the three-ton school had called the
previous evening to celebrate the fact
that it was the first evening that ever
was, to congratulate the young couple
and to discuss plans for the manage-
ment of the fresh globe. Not one of
them brought his wife to talk chiffons
to the hostess, and after fuming for a
while Eve had pointedly asked the eldest
if his dame didn’t regard her as respect-
able. The reply that she would call
as soon as Eve got some clothes
rather widened the breach than other-
wise.
The visitors stayed on drinking water
with Adam till a late hour, and some
of them left with a perceptible stagger.
So the young wife went to bed late and
tired, not satisfied with the past and
hardly troubling to be curious about the
future.
Still sitting up in the only bedstead on
earth, and keeping half-pound flies off
her back with an impatient hand, Eve
inspected the sleeping stranger, or almost-
stranger, whom she had thoughtlessly
wedded. She wondered languidly about
his past, and persuaded herself that he
bore traces of dissipation. His aspect,
she decided, was that of a man who had
been out all night.
It was the illogical way of woman.
Adam had been out all night. All the
world was “out” then, and “in” hadn’t
been invented. As he slept on, Eve
wondered what was the recipe for wak-
ing a husband who didn’t seem to know
enough to wake himself. As no husband
had ever been shaken by his wife before,
precedent was lacking.
The First Husband woke at length,
and after some brisk recrimination the
pair became reconciled, and swam to-
gether in the blue river and the bluish-
green lake.
At breakfast Eve tried hard to extract
some information about her husband’s
people, and the dispute flared up again
when she was merely informed that when
she could cook half as well as the elder
Mrs. Adam she would be a better orna-
ment to society than she was. On his
wife pouring some weak tea over her-
self to simulate tears (she learned how
to produce real tears later) he hurriedly
relented, however, and admitted that the
alleged lady didn’t exist. In fact, he was
a foundling.
So Eve brushed her husband carefully,
and started him away to his office, where
he was setting up in the importing busi-
ness, with marine insurance as a side-
line. Then she drifted back to her house-
keeping with the long, easy stride of a
matron unencumbered by skirts, and
found the first-known applicant for a
housemaid’s job waiting on the door-
step.
She was a draggled, slovenly creature
without references, and said she was an
ourang-outang, and also a grass-widow
who had been “deceived.” She alleged
that she could cook, and she carried an
unwholesome baby-ape under her left
arm.
Eve and Jezebel are almost the only
women who have a big place of their
own in Scripture history, for Esther and
Ruth are interpolations who could be
left out with no damage to the continuity
of the narrative. Women get a very
poor show in Holy Writ. Solomon
owned 1000 wives, of whom 700 were
royal, and save that one is named once
they might all have been Ann Smith.
The usual formula reads: “And the
king slept with his fathers, who grumbled
a little but moved up to make room for
him ; and Shekeliah, his son, reigned in
his stead. And his mother’s name was
Tibuburra of Beth-Drought.”
Very often poor Queen Tibuburra was
denied even that scrap of attention.

A DINKUM SANTA GAUS.
By HAROLD MERCER.
DIRECTLY the old chap edged on to
the seat I guessed he had decided
that I was a good mark for a fill of
tobacco. Both were right; but he seemed
an interesting old reprobate. There was
a gleam of humor in his eyes. After
he had filled up and put the balance of
his ample helping from my pouch in
his pocket, he noticed my glance at the
white whiskers sprouting all round his
face. He stroked them thoughtfully.
“They ain’t as long as they used ter
be,” he said. “Why, larst Chris’mus I
was a dinkum Santa Claus!”
“A dinkum Santa Claus?” I ques-
tioned.
“It was this way. I was down at the
Centeral, up on a drunk charge—what’s
Chris’mus for, anyway? Me whiskers
was that long that every cow about the
place calls me ‘Father Chris’mus.’ Y’ see,
it was quite a long time since I’d been
out at the Bay, an’ it was ’ard enough
gittin’ the dough for booze without
thinkin’ about shaves an’ ’aircuts.
“ ‘Comorn, Father Chris’mus,’ says the
John. ‘This is you! Drunk, yer Wor-
ship.’ An’ ’e tells ’is Nibs all about
it, includin’ the times I’d been there be-
fore, an’ ’ow orfen I’d signed the pledge.
“ ‘Fined five shillings,’ says ’is Nibs.
“Well, o’ course I couldn’t find no five
bob, an’ I was sayin’ so when a well-
dressed bloke in the court calls out
‘l’ll pay the fine, yer Worship.’
“ ’E slings me a bob an’ tells me to
wait for ’im. It appears ’e was there to
be fined for indecent drivin’ or one of
them things blokes as own cars fall in
for. O’ course I waited, after spendin’
the bob ; ’e looked a bloke ’oo’d be good
for more than a deener. An open-’anded,
laughin’ sort.
“ ’Ere ’e is! ’ ’e cries when ’e comes
out o’ the court with some other blokes.
‘What d’you think of ’im for a dinkum
Santa Claus? My sister-in-law Ally’s
’oldin’ a children’s Chris’mus Eve party
to-night an’ I’m going to take ’im along
to be Father Chris’mus. Whadyer say to
that, dad?’
“ ‘Sounds all right to me,’ I says, ‘as
long as the dough’s right,’ says I. ’E
laughs an’ says ’e’d treat me fair, an’
then ’e pushes me inter ’is car—a swell
affair it was —and orf we goes. It
appears ’e don’t intend to take me ’ome,
not yet. ’E wants to show me orf to
’is frien’s first —‘me genu-wine Father
Chris’mus,’ ’e calls me.
“Don’t arsk me wot sort o’ morning it
was! The porters at the ’Otel Splen-
diferous, ’oo orfen sooled me away w’en
I was cadgin’ for coins or bumpers,
wanted to chase me out till the bloke
tells ’em I’m with ’im ; then they looked
as if they wanted to bite me. So did a
dawg that was in a place they called the
Wintergarden with a woman ’e called
Ella; but she picked ’im up an’ ’eld
the yappin’ beast. When ’e interdooced
me an’ asked ’er wot she thort of the
dinkum Father Chris’mus ’e was takin’
to ’is sister-in-law’s party, she said ‘Too
sweet! ’ Me! ”
Looking at him I certainly thought the
expression rather misplaced.
“I tell yer I was a sensation! I didden
mind, not even bein’ shown orf to the
barmaids, ’oo wanted to know where
Reggie—they called ’im Reggie—’ad
picked me up. Y’ see, ’e an’ ’is frien’s
was a hopen-’anded lot, an’ every time
they ’ad a drink there was one for me.
“Reggie was a bit lively by the time
we got inter ’is car again, an’ ’e was
very jolly an’ confidential-like.
“ ‘lt’s me brother’s wife’s ’ouse I’m
takin’-you to,’ ’e tells me. ‘Ye’ve gotter
be on yer best be’avior. She mightn’t
welcome you too well, at first; but
she’ll soon see the joke. A good sort.’
“ ’E drives on a bit, but, jist as I’m
dozin’, I ’eard ’im talkin’ again.
“ ‘Only thing I’ve got agin Ally,’ ’e
says, ‘is she’s a climber. Calls ’erself
Alicia now ; used to be Alice. It wooden
matter two pins if she didden want
to interfere with Gwen—that’s me niece.
’Andson’s a decent young feller, but
Ally’s down on ’im in spite of Gwen
likin’ ’im, ’cause she wants Gwennie to
marry a bloke of a Nenglish fambly.
“It didden matter to me; I s’pose ’e
wooden ’ave spoken about all that to
me, only ’e was a bit shot; an’ I tries to
go to sleep again in spite of ’is torkin’.
But I wakes up to find ’e’s pulled the
car up an’s still yappin’.
“ ‘Y’ know,’ ’e says, ‘it ain’t fair to
Gwen, bein’ badgered about marryin’
a Nenglish Johnnie jist because of ’er
mother’s soshal nambitions. I wish
Ally wassen like that —it spoils ’er.’
“’E spoke, grieved-like, jist as if it
was my fault, but I let ’im ’ave it ’is own
way. I was goin’ well an’ didden
care what ’appened. When I wakes up
the car was stopped again, an’ a lady,
standin’ in front of a big ’ouse, was
starin’ in at the winder at me. I stared
back a bit; there seemed somethin’
fermiliar about ’er, but a man carn’t
remember all the people ’e’s cadged from.
“‘What are you?’ she demands.
“ ‘l’m Father Chris’mus,’ I says.
“ ‘Oh, are you?’ she says. ‘An’ what
are you doin’ in there?’
“ ‘The bloke wot owns this car brought
me ’ome in it. ’E paid for me,’ I says ;
an’ then, seein’ from the look of ’er
that she didden understand, I adds: ‘At
the Centeral P’lice Court. I’m to be
Santa Claus at a children’s I says.
“I s’pose I should’ve broken the noos
to ’er gentler ; for when Reg appeared,
cornin’ through the ’ouse, she turns on
’im an’ calls ’im a disgrace. ‘Other men
’ave to get drunk to do the things you
can do sober,’ she says; ‘an’ you’re
drunk now.’
“But Reg ’ad a way with ’im, an’ ’e
took ’er into the ’ouse, laughin’, an’
tellin’ me to foller. I stood in the ’all
“What an awful place to spend a honeymoon !”
“Yes —worst I ever sampled.”
while they talked over matters in a room
off it, wonderin’ what I’d be able to ’it
’im for, for waste o’ time and breach o’
contrack, if the job didden come orf, an’
lookin’ at what the nobs call the hobjects
of bigotry and virchew, ter see if there
was anythin’ I could put in me pocket.
“I ’ears Reg say that all I wants is
a clean-up an’ the proper clothes, an’ a
young girl—that was Gwen —’oo pratted
into the argument, I ’eard ’er say ‘lt’ll
be a scream!’ An’ then the missus she
starts to laugh, too.
“About the barf —I was inclined to
kick when I ’eard about that. I ain’t
one of those dirty people as ’as to be
always washin’ theirselves an’ wastin’
good water. But when I got meself
to face it the barf was good-oh—
a lot better than the one ye’ve gotter
take at the Bay. Arterwards, when they’d
give me a feed an’ put me inter bed in
clean per jamas, Reg comes up with a
bottle o’ whisky.
“ ‘ ’Ere’s yer ’air of the dawg for ye,’
’e says. ‘Now you sleep it orf, an’ you’ll
be bright an’ lively to-night.’
“I tell yer I felt like the Prince o’
Wales lying there in the room of the
chaffer they’d ’ad to git rid of because
of the bad times —especially as ’e didden
notice that I ’ad slipped the bottle o’
whisky under the bed while ’e wassen
me, an’ ’e seemed a bit taken aback
in a stiff shirt an’ black clo’es, to wake
me, an’ ’e seemed a bit taken-aback
to see me squiffy. But ’e took it in good
part, even when ’e’d spotted the whisky
bottle. It meant another ’ot barf to
pull me together again. But I seemed
to be gettin’ used to barfs.
“It was a gran’ party that night—
don’t arsk me about it! Especially when
I’d found where the licker was, an’ ’ow
to get at it, quite innercent-like, without
being seen. The lady of the ’ouse, it
appears, didden ’ave no kids of ’er own,
only Gwen, ’oo was growed; but there
was a lot of kids in the Dart family
she’d married into, an’ she liked to enter-
tain ’em. I was a great success amongst
them kids. Reckoned I was worth
me money, whatever it was, an’ per-
haps they’d give me extra for me enter-
tainment. Y’ know ’ow, when a man
gets a few in, ’e thinks ’e owns the earth.
“An’ all the time I was thinkin’ that
this was good-oh, if I c’d make it larst.
They was good-natchered people, an’ a
man might be a file to prat ’isself in fer
an ’ome, fer a while, at least. It’d do
me, if I c’d! The idea’s in me think-box
that if I c’d only put meself in good with
the dame, Ally, it’d ’elp. Then I thinks
of what Reg’d let out to me in the car
that I’d ’eard dreamy-like. From what
I c’d remember, then, Ally wanted Gwen
to marry a young nob, an’ ’ere was a
young nob follerin’ ’er about, an’ I kept
worryin’ meself as to ’ow I c’d do some-
thin’ outer it to please the old bird.
“I sets out to make me king-’it when
the pair stopped right in front of me,
sudden; it seems to me that now’s me
charnce, now or never.
“ ‘Father Chris’mus’s blessin’ on this
young couple,’ I says, as if I was a
Salv’army colonel or a bishop or some-
thin’. ‘An ’an’somer couple there
cooden be in orl Horstralia! Kiss one
another, with the blessin’ of Father
Chris’mus!’ I says.
“The young bloke looks at Gwen with
a laugh, an’ she laughs too; an’ ’e
says, ‘That seems like a horder,’ an’
kissed ’er before orl the crowd. She
seemed to like it, an’ it was a great ’it,
from the way everybody laughed an’
clapped.
“An’ then me face fell, as the say in’
goes—fell so much that I felt as if it’d
’it the floor. I’d made a mistook ; I c’d
see that from the way Ally was lookin’
at me, with a heye of thunder. An’ the
doodish-lookin’ bloke beside ’er was
lookin’ sourer than she was! Cripes,
it made me feel crook, throwin’ away
a good ’ome like that. I tried to lose
meself in the crowd, ’opin’ I c’d find a
drink, which I needed. But they was
too quick for me ; I ’adn’t ’ad no more’n
three drinks, what people ’ad left ’ere
an’ there on tables an’ things, before they
run me down —she lookin’ like a storm
an’ Reg laughin’ ’earty, tryin’ to chaff
’er to a good ’umor.
“ ‘You’ll ’ave to get ’im away, Reg,’
she says. ‘lt’s time ’e finished.’
“ ‘Don’t worry about me, mum,’ I
says, ‘l’m enjoyin’ it.’
“ ‘Comorn an’ I’ll git yer a drink,’
says Reg. An’ some’ow I found meself
at the gate with ’im in a noo second-’and
soot of clobber they’d give me.
’Ere’s ten bob,’ ’e says, ‘an’ a couple
of bob extra to get a bed to-night; an’
’ere’s a little flask of whisky. Now
ye’re set; git along, ole man! ’
“ ‘Look ’ere, Mister Reg,’ I says, ‘a
man can’t be Father Chris’mus all the
year round. What about a job feedin’
the fowls?’
“ ‘We don’t keep fowls. You’ll ’ave
to get along, old man. Go’-night,’ ’e
says, and shuts the gate on me.
“It seemed like an ’in't; I wassen
wanted. But some’ow I didden like the
idea of takin’ my nice clean clobber to
a doss-’ouse. So I ’ung round.
“It was a warm night, an’ I was com-
for’ble enough ; but they made quite a
song about it when they found me asleep
in a ’ammock on the lawn. It was
the servants made the most fuss, an’
when I argued with them Reg an’ Ally
an’ Gwen came down to look at me,
an’ ’e tells me that I’d been paid, an’
this was over the odds.
“I puts on the soft pedal. I arsks ’em
’ow they c’d think of turnin’ Father
Chris’mus out in the crool world —on
Chris’mus Day, too!
“ ‘ ’E’s right,’ says young Gwen ; ‘we
can ’ardly do that, can we?’
“ ‘lf ’e doesn’t go we’ll call a p’lice-
man to him,’ says Reg. It ’urt me, but
’e was sol’m this mornin’.
“ ‘Oh, no, I won’t ’ave a perliceman
brought to ’im,’ says Ally, which sur-
prised me more than Reg ’ad done.
“ ‘Why not let the poor ole man stay
an’ ’ave a little of our Chris’mus dinner?’
says Gwen. ‘ ’E’ll go away after that,
won’t you?’
“They let it go at that. Slap-up dinner
it was ; an’ there was some booze to it,
too, when I tole ’em that lemonade gave
me colic. An’ then they said good-bye
to me, quite nice, with a few more bob
added, an’ thort they was rid of me.
“But not me ; I ain’t the sort o’ man
to let a good ’ome go to waste if there’s
a chance of ’anging on to it. Besides, I
felt I ’ad a sorter claim on ’em.
“It was their own fault. The lights
’avin’ gone out in the room, I thort
they’d finished with it for the night. But
the light switched on again ; an’ when
Ally saw me asleep on the couch she
let out a scream that brought all the
’ouse’old. They ’adn’t gone to bed, as
I thort. That’s the worst of these big
’ouses ; you can’t be certain.
“ ‘Look, you get out, an’ stay out,
or I’ll ’and you over to the perlice,’
says Reg. I turns to Ally, seein’ there’s
no ’ope in ’im.
“ ‘l’m a poor, ’omeless wanderer,
mum,’ I says, tears in me voice. ‘You,
with your kind ’eart, ’ave given me a
taste of an ’ome, an’ ’
“ ‘l’ll ring the perlice an’ ’and ’im
over,’ says Reg. ’E was provin’ ’imself
a real narsty bloke.
“‘No, you won’t!’ she says. ‘You’ll
get out your car, an’ take ’im away—
far enough for ’im not to return. An’
pay ’im to keep away.’
“ ‘l’ve got me car ’ere, Mrs. Dart,’
says the bloke ’oo’d kissed
Gwen. ‘l’ll take ’im.’
“What was the good of
argyin’? I walked out as
if me ’eart was broke,
which it wassen, seein’
there was good cash
a’ead; but I stopped in
the doorway, ’earin’ angry
words between them two
—Reg and ’er.
“ ‘lf ’e comes back again, I’ll call the
perlice!’ says Reg.
“‘You won’t!’ she says, fierce-like.
‘Oh, you’re be’avin’ like a cad, Reg! You
know very well why I won’t ’ave the
perlice to ’im! You know the trick
you’ve played on me!’
“ ‘What on earth’s the matter with
you, Ally?’ ’e arsks.
“ ‘Every time you tork of the perlice
you put the screw in! Very well —I
surrender! Gwen can marry young
’Arry, if she likes. After all, ’e’s a nice
feller. ’E wouldn’t do the caddish thing
you’ve done!’
“ ‘I don’t understand,’ ’e stammers.
“You c’d see that ’e didden really ; but
I did. I knoo, then, why Ally’s face ’ad
seemed fermiliar. She was me niece.
Yes, mister, me niece Alice. Used to
climb on me knee. Didden see ’er agin
fer years ; then I saw ’er in the little
bush pub where she was ’ousemaid an’
beer-puller. I’d ’eard that she’d married
a rich squatter, but that was the larst
I’d seen of ’er.
“She thort that Reg knoo ’oo I was
an’ ’ad brought me up to remind ’er of
what she ’ad been, to force ’er to reason
over Gwen’s affair. Well, I was glad of
that; but I’d alius been fond of little
Ally, an’ she’d been kind-’earted to me
when she was at the pub, slippin’ me
free drinks an’ silver. 1 wassen goin’ to
’ave ’er ’umbled ; I was glad she’d got
on.”
There was some genuine feeling in the
old ruffian’s voice as he spoke.
“So I went away in ’Arry’s car, leavin’
the forchin it might’ve been to me be’ind.
But I got three quid out of it—the quid
Reg gave me, the quid she sent after
me an’ the one ’Arry gave me out of
gratitood before ’e said good-bye. An’,”
he concluded with a wink, “Ally springs
a few bob to go on with now an’ then,
when I send her me address.”
It was afterwards, when, remembering
an appointment, I had left in a hurry,
that I found I was without my tobacco
pouch. The dinkum Santa Claus must
have pocketed it.

. ELECTING THE ELEVEN.
If the extension of N.S.W. Leg. Coun-
cil rules—everybody a candidate and a
voter —to the selection of the men for
England has led to unexpected results, it
will be universally conceded that no more
representative team has left these shores.
In one respect only was popular pre-
diction fulfilled: Bradman secured his
qu0ta—117,976. His surplus was distri-
buted among numerous candidates, not-
ably Jack Lang, Jimmy Pike, Kingsford
Smith, W. H. Whiddon, Dr. Bradfield
and Tom Garrett. Thanks to the sup-
port of the veterans in the Sydney C.G.
members’ stand, who did great work
among members of the Old-age Pen-
sioners’ League, the only survivor of
the 1878 eleven will don flannels at the
Oval once more.
Victorians polled strongly for Wood-
full, Dr. Mannix, S. M. Bruce, Jack Holt
and Jack Wren. Enemies of S. ML Bruce
suggest that a lot of ignorant admirers
confused him with the old-time left-
hander Billy Bruce, but the U.A.P. in-
sists that he got in on sheer merit, and
confidently predicts that a nobby pad-
spat he has patented will knock ’em at
Lord’s.
The loyalty of Victorians to their own
is illustrated by the fact that 27 votes
were cast for Melba. They came from
a village at the back of Porepunkah. A
few Centralian voters plumped for Phar
Lap.
Queensland went baldheaded for
Darby Riordan, M.H.R., and Gladys
Moncrieff.. South Aus. divided its allegi-
ance between Vic Richardson and the
agricultural scientist of the same name
(the invention of a way of making cocky-
chaff a. palatable breakfast dish for har-
vest hands turned the scale in favor of
the prof.) ; Westralia showed a prefer-
ence for Miss Holman, M.L.A.; but Tas-
mania’s vote was scattered among a mul-
titude of candidates, Walter Lindrum
polling more than Joe Lyons.
The team will consist of Bradmam
Jack Lang, Jimmy Pike, Whiddon, Dr.
Bradfield, Tom Garrett, Kingsford Smith
(N.S.W.), Woodfull, Dr. Mannix, Bruce,
Jack Holt, Jack Wren, Bobby Lewis
(Vic.), Darby Riordan, Gladys Moncrieff
(Q.) and Professor Richardson (S.A.).
An objection has been lodged against
the return of Jack Wren on the ground
that the returning officer improperly
credited him with Hall Mark preferences.

now overflowing
on the roadway,
was watching.
By the time the
cop had forced his
way through the
gathering to ’phone
for help, motor-
trucks, -cars and
pedestrians were

street.
At this stage the
citizen who had

moved on, satisfied
that he had proved his contention that
mankind, in the mass, is something under

True. A man can fall under a tram

to whom he named the winner; fake
coins ; buy sweep tickets and raffle them ;
cash valueless cheques ; run for Parlia-
ment ; help other people to run for Par-
liament ; peddle sly grog.
What the average man wants to know,
however, is how to get a job.

“Drinkin’ draught beer.”

AGITATION.
“The house was in a turmoil.”
—Sydney “Sun.”
The walls stood agape;, the door
banged ; the windows shook; the roof
(unwilling to be mixed up in the fracas)
sloped; the foundations were rocked;
the kettle boiled ; the pot seethed; the
vegetables were in a stew; the oven
grew hot; the bread became crusty ; the
toast burned to take a part in the proceed-
ings ; the tap threw cold water on the
tubs, which were fixed determinedly ; the
gas meter was read in the face ; the elec-
tric light failed; the table groaned ; the
bed lost its spring ; and one of the chairs
hadn’t a leg to stand on. It was funny
to see the carpet tack and the hall stand.
The wall, which came out of the busi-
ness very badly, said it was all a picture-
frame up.

DORA, NIRA AND NEP.
(With apologies to Eugene Field )
“Britain’s Dora (Defence of the Realm Act)
and Russia’s Nep (New Economic Policy) are
dismally recalled by America’s Nira (National
Industrial Recovery Act).”
Dora, Nira and Nep one night
Went out on a razzle-dazz.,
Sailed on a river of chrysolite
Into a sea of jazz.
“Where are you going and what do you
wish?”
The old moon asked the three.
“We have come with a lien on all the
fish
That swim in this beautiful sea.
Government licenses have we,”
Said Dora,
Nira,
And Nep.
The old moon laughed, but she bothered
not
To bid them watch their steps,
Not though she’d seen no end of a lot
Of Doras, Niras and Neps.
She know the stars were the only fish
' To catch in that beautiful sea,
“But cast your nets wherever you wish
And have a slap-up spree,”
So murmured the moon to the fisher-
girls three,
Dora,
Nira,
And Nep.
So all night long they sought to strike
The stars in the twinkling foam
(These politicians are much alike
Abroad, you see, and at home).
’Twas a play so pretty it hardly seemed
That such a thing could be,
And some chaps thought 'twas a dream
they dreamed
Of a boat in a fairy sea.
But / shall name you the fisher-girls
three,
Dora,
Nira,
And Nep.
Now Dora, she was an English jane,
And Nep was a Russ, you’ll note,
And Nira comes from the wide domain
Of the Yank —and the shoe-peg oat.
So shut your eyes while a minstrel sings
Of wonderful fish you see
o When you’re slightly inked) and other
things
In the beautiful, misty sea,
Where they ventured forth, the fisher-
girls three,
Dora,
Nira,
And Nep.
T. THE R.
THE WORST OFFENCE.
He stood abashed —the King of Crime,
Whose name filled peaceful men with
dread;
He’d murdered people in his time,
But now, ashamed, he hung his head :
His wife, with eyes of anger, saw
His gasper-ash upon the floor.

PUZZLED.
I have been the nurse of Doctor S.
For several years, but I must confess
That he keeps his accounts in a way
that I
Am unable to fathom, however l try.
With Mr. A. or Mr. 8.,
Or dear old, fat old Mrs. C.,
Fie records the use of his medical skill
So he won’t forget to send the bill.
But I cannot see (unless it be
That he’s very devoted to charitee )
Why he never keeps notes of his dealings
with
That perfectly thrilling Pansy Smith.

OLD FOSSICKER
By H. DRAKE-BROCKMAN.
SNAKEY had been working at the
creek edge, a hundred yards or so
off the track, when he heard the
car coming. Heard it stop. He’d not
bothered to look up. Cars went through
in droves these days—one a week at least
he d say. And they always stopped at
the Chow’s garden.
Then he had heard feet come crunching
down the hill. He’d replied “G’day,”
when voices greeted him. Out the tail
of his eye he’d seen a skirt fluttering
close to where he squatted. But there
had been a speck in his pan—one he
kept losing sight of; he’d not bothered
to look up simply because he couldn’t
afford to miss even a speck, however odd
it might be to see a skirt. So he’d just
answered all their questions and hoped
they’d move on and let him be ; he was
busy.
But when at last they walked off up
to their car, he’d overheard the woman
say, in a light, gay sort of voice, “My
dear, just imagine it! Been here since
’B6, he said. Didn’t once glance from
his wretched pan. Not even at me!
Yet up here a white woman appears to
be a kind of phenomenon to most
men.... Talk about the lure of gold! ”
“His loss,” laughed a man’s voice in
reply, deepening to a note which sur-
prised in Snakey’s heart a swift-answering
echo from the past.
“Queer old blighter,” said the man.
“Suppose he still hopes to make a
fortune.”
Then they were gone, and the car
started. Just as he’d collected his speck.
So he’d stood up and looked down the
road where the motor crawled like a
beetle, on towards Hall’s Creek. All he’d
seen of the woman with the gay young
voice was a flutter of bright green—
what was the stuff called? Ah, he remem-
bered: green gossamer.
That had been early in the afternoon.
Now old Snakey Evans was crouched
once more over his pan, dribbling the
muddy water away as for countless days
he had dribbled it. Slish, slosh, went the
water round the rim of the battered tin
basin; slish, slosh over his withered
fingers, back to the miniature gully his
pick had clawed out at the edge of the
creek. Close handy lay the pick, by
his side.
His once-brave blue eyes, their color
long since muddied by time, were yet
vigilant, expectant, raking the slush in
the dish, seeking without respite that
tiny flash of fire which gold flings back
to the sun.
Presently he ceased panning. Carefully
he picked out an infinitesimal grain glit-
tering in the mire. He reached for a
tobacco-tin, and, opening it with tender
hands, washed from off a grimy finger-
tip, in the grimy liquid the tin contained,
the just-gathered speck of gold. Almost
reverentially he gazed at it, a fleck of
.pure light, with a dozen mates glinting,
winking at him, enlivening the grubby
shallow tin.
Slowly Snakey set down the tin. Stiffly
he rose. His naked feet squelched in
mud which came oozing up between his
toes in a way that sixty years earlier
would have made him shiver with delight.
He hitched his pants, ready for a swing
of the pick, when the westering sun
caught in his eyes: over on the ranges its
warmth poured, brilliant as a lacquer of
gold.
Late, it was. He’d have to get a move
on if he wished to work as far as he’d
pegged out for the day. Didn’t do to
stop late in the creek-bed. Fever. He’d
been too knocked all of a heap to want
another dose like the last....
Yet the old man’s eyes lingered on the
ironstone crags, transformed by the
alchemy of sunlight into hills of gold.
Hills of gold! The words tumbled glit-
tering into Snakey’s mind. Well —of
course, they were hills of gold ; all the
best stuff still waiting to be found. And
he’d find it!
What was it those flaming slopes made
him think of? “Back a bit, Snakey,” he
muttered conversationally to himself; he
never had a word for anybody else, but
he didn’t mind talking to Snakey. “Back
a bit”.... Ah, he had it now: Hell’s
Gate. That’s what the golden hills put
him in mind of. Hell’s Gate, they’d
called the place forty years ago—must be
a darned sight more than forty years
ago!
Pretty, those hills. Overhead he could
see a crow cruising round. Always crows
in Kimberley. He’d grown used to them,
but he remembered getting sick to death
of their eternal caw-cawing when first he
came.
His hands found a second tobacco-tin.
He glanced down and discovered just
enough ’bacca for one smoke. Getting
low!. He’d have to take what stuff he
had into the Creek, this week. A bloke
couldn’t do without a smoke! But he’d
found so little this last month—he felt
almost ashamed to take it to Snowy
Barker at the store...'.
Absently he filled his pipe and lit it.
The smoke sprayed into the air like a
jet of gold-dust. And the pale sparkling
light bathed his gnarled figure as it bathed
the hills, and washed to brilliance the
trunks of river-gums further down the
creek, where they marched along as
formal as a file of white-breeched soldiers.
Pretty. He’d not sat and stared round
like this for years! Must be that woman’s
voice which had set him thinking. Made
him remember, that visit had. Been
wanting to think ever since: thoughts
been jostling each other in his head.
It was the time he’d had to devote to
shoving them back which had kept him
from doing all he’d pegged for the day.
This was the first time since Rosie went
away that he’d not finished what he’d
planned to d 0... .and it was years and
years since Rosie went! Women, it was,
“There goes my first husband. Do you think I did wrong in marrying him?”
“Well, considering the alimony, you didn’t do bad.”
did this sort of thing—threw a bloke out
of his stride
Hell’s Gate. He could see it now, that
gap in the Hardman Ranges, flat and
smooth as a highway between the cliffs,
where, if you looked to the east, the
sun rose up in a great flaming splendor.
Right along the foot of the Hardmans
ran the Goldfields Road. (An overgrown
track long since, but how was Snakey
to guess that?) And he had camped close
to the Gap, one night.
He’d gone down to the sleepy pools
of the Margaret River for a wash. At
sundown the lights of a hundred fires
glowed along the Goldfields Road. Like
an Eden, that river valley, with its trees
and curling creepers, so . green to eyes
wearied by mile after mile of grass plain,
rustling and dry. Dozens of little fires,
there’d been —lit each night in a different
spot, on the move to Hall’s Creek and
the gold. Foot-walkers like himself;
fellows with camels; fellows with
donkeys, mules, horses and carts. The
riders and coves with carts had been able
to push on and get there quicker—but
they’d all got there in the end.
; Twenty-three he’d been, in ’B6. A
likely-looking lad, too. He could re-
member how the very printing on the
newspapers seemed to turn golden before
his eyes as he read, down south, about
the Hall’s Creek find. Hell! had thought
young George Evans, who would drive
a milk-cart for choice when there was
gold lying round, waiting to be picked
up?
Till then young George had been
pleased enough to drive his milk-cart,
just for the joy of being outside. He’d
refused to go clerking, as his mother had
wished, he, the bright one of the family ;
he used to plan to get a place of his own
up-country. But that was before the
gold-bug bit him....
Hell’s Gate, they’d called the place.
But he’d thought it a fine sight, himself ;
that morning seemed to promise the ful-
filment of youth’s wildest dreams. Beside
such lavish, extravagant, opulent out-
pouring of glory, all other dawns grew
pallid. He’d stopped rolling up his swag
to stare ; and the others chi-acked him.
“What you gaping at, George?” they
called. “Ain’t you ever seen the gun
rise before?”
He’d said nothing. And next day
one of the same mob christened him
Snakey. It had stuck, that name. Snakey,
eh? Just because he wasn’t going to give
away what he thought to a crowd of
rough-and-tumbles
Gold—gold—gold! The heavens had
been gold that morning, as the hills
were now. Gold —the one word on every
man’s lips. Gold —the one vision light-
ing every man’s mind.
And gold there had been. This place
—old Snakey for a moment shifted his
gaze from the hills—there had been two
thousand diggers camped right here. Up
by his solitary camp once stood a pub
where men had squared their slates with
nuggets. Men who roared and shouted
and sang and swore. Men who picked
up the creek, tore up the rocks, tunneled
into the dry spinifex hills. All search-
ing. To-day—to-morrow, perhaps, each
had thought he would find that which
he sought: that slug, that reef, that gold
which would turn his life into a riot of
realised desire.
Well—inside two years they had
mostly gone!
A few struck it lucky. Young Welch,
now. But most of them went off cussing.
He’d heard tales—how the Goldfields
Road had been littered with cast-off kits ;
how men had died, hope putrefying in
their hearts, died cursing with their last
breath, cursing and staggering back past
Hell’s Gate.
He’d known bad times himself, when
both chamois and tucker-bag had lain
empty ; but always he’d pulled his belt
tighter and stuck it. It was here, some-
where, that sought-for reef! He knew it.
He had heard chaps with information
saying up at the pub that over a hun-
dred thousand pounds’ worth of alluvial
gold alone had been sent away. Now,
where was that to come from, he’d like
to know, if there was no reef? But
there was; and he meant to discover
where. “Hoping he’d make a fortune” —
that fellow from the car had said. Well,
of course! Why else had he stayed
here?
How often he and Rosie had talked it
out! A bright bit, Rosie, and no mis-
take, with her yellow curls and dancing
brown eyes and the arch way she’d rally
a chap. She’d appeared behind the crazy
bar-counter at the pub, suddenly. But
then you got used to everything appearing
suddenly at the diggings. One minute
you’d be poor as a bush nigger, the next,
if you struck it, rich as a lord. It hadn’t
seemed at all unusual to discover, over-
night as it were, a good-looking girl at
the pub.
She had livened things up a treat, too.
Fights galore; and once the publican
got busy with his gun and warned some
fellows off. Rosie was wild about that,
said she could look after herself, thank
you. All the same, she quite soon told
Snakey he might keep an eye on some
of the roughs for her, if he liked
If he’d liked! Presently it came tc
them going down there, near the riveir*
gums, he and Rosie alone together, talk*
ing of the things they’d do when h$
struck it....
Then one day young Welch walked in
with a nugget as big as his head —and
that was saying a bit! He didn’t blame
Rosie, of course—young Welch was a
clean upstanding sort of cove, and the
nugget a record-breaker. Welch sold
his claim and cleared ; reckoned he’d had
enough and was going while the going
was good. And the day after, Rosie was
missing, too. Well —it had been fine
while it lasted. Had made a bloke feel
almost as if he didn’t care if he found
any gold or not; and at the same time,
in a ridiculous back to front way, made
him want it all the more!
But the publican had sworn. No more
women, he said. Nevertheless, one or
two turned up later, with their men
mostly. A tough lot. But he himself
had never noticed another, after Rosie.
He was too busy getting on with the job.
And then he got matey with Tom.
There’d followed months and years of
prospecting. He and Tom had gone all
over the place, right out into unexplored
nigger country, razor-backed hills, the
sort a bird would break its wings on,
and great plains and rivers. But always
they had lobbed
back here, back to
this spot on the
creek a few miles
from the township.
He could remem-
ber as clear as yes-
terday the shock
they’d got, after
their first trip.
They’d left Hall’s
Creek a live place ;
they returned to a
rotting corpse. Five
pubs there’d been, if
you please, and
stores by the yard—
and about one man
and a dog when they
got back!
At first they’d
missed the company.
Missed the camp
gatherings in the
evenings, the drink-
ing and singing and
gambling. At least,
Tom had. Him-
self—well, he was
Snakey Evans, who
never chummed up,
but used to sit quiet,
smoking and staring
ing at the hills and
the sky. That’s what
they’d said, at any
rate. All the same,
the noise and rowdy
voices had been kind
of friendly in the background.
But he and Tom soon got accustomed
to having only a couple more fossickers
for company, whenever they were home
here at their camp. And they always
found at least enough to keep them in
tucker....
Life had been good, till Tom cleared
off. Became yardman at the last re-
maining pub, until he died. Cleaning
up the pots and pans, all the kitchen mul-
lock—bah!
Fastidious, Tom had called him.
Strange how you could live years with
a mate, do anything for him, and then
all of a sudden find him getting your
goat! Such a little thing, too! But he’d
always had a tidy camp, he had. No
time for dirt. Regular old woman, he’d
been called.
He’d not minded ; not minded cleaning
up Tom’s messes for years. Till that
night—well, he supposed they’d both felt
a bit frayed. The leader they’d been
following for a hard week just petered
out. And they were short of tucker. And
it was a cold night. And one of the cats
was mewing round.
Tom, he’d kicked the cat. And that
made him, Snakey, feel hot in the collar.
Then Tom spat twice right in the centre
of the new-mudded floor, Then there’d
been he 11....
In the morning Tom had cleared off
without a word, taken his gear and gone
into the Creek. Snakey had only seen
him about once a month after that, when
he went in to get rations. Mighty distant
they’d both been, too —till Tom lay dying.
Then Snowy Barker up at the store did

a decent thing—sent out one of his
niggers with a milli-milli for Snakey.
So he’d trudged in to say good-bye to the
best mate a man ever had
Ever since then he’d stuck here. A
man needed his mate to go prospecting
with. And he was all alone now, except
for the old Chow who grew vegetables
over in the yard of what had once been
a hotel. A binghi wife the Chinaman
had, and a brood of almond-eyed picca-
ninnies. Sometimes he and Snakey said
“G’day.” But Snakey, whose camp still
looked clean as a new sovereign, and
whose cats were trained like circus
animals, never went near the garden.
Occasionally one of the piccaninnies
brought him a few vegetables. Some-
times, when he’d been extra lucky, he
fetched back a bag of lollies for the
naked little brats.
Too much thinking got you nowhere!
Snakey knocked out his pipe and rose.
He stooped for the pick. All the same,
he thought, why call it Hell’s Gate? He
didn’t reckon much on that idea of Hell
—it was a good country, this, room to
move in, to live in without being
bothered. And that fortune —ah, how the
thought of it stirred the blood in his
veins! To-morrow; the next day....
He and Tom had always been absolutely
certain it was round about here the
reef lay.
The golden lacquer had been rubbed
from the hills. Just here and there a
ripple of light ringed the rolling spinifex
downs or tipped red stone cliffs with
scarlet. The crows cawed. And the
sharp clang of old Snakey’s pick rang
out like the impudent challenge of man-
made civilisation to a primeval world.
The old man squatted and prepared to
sluice the loosened soil. Instead, fever-
ishly, his thin hands tore the earth from
a great lump of quartz. Quartz! It was
a slug! Here it was at last, after all these
years! As big as his head, as big as
Welch’s! With the shining line his pick
had scratched grinning cheerfully at
him!
Hard to believe, even though he had
always known. Yet here it was, large
enough to make him a wealthy man, liv-
ing in ease for the rest of his days, find-
ing other girls as sweet as Rosie, staying
in flash pubs, doing what he liked! And
he would be able to peg a claim here as
well, and sell it. He didn’t doubt this
was but promise of more to come. After
all these years! Yet what else had kept
him here but the certainty that to-day-
to-morrow —or the next day?
He stood up. He squared his shoulders.
And, for once forgetting his pick, went
“My old man worked three days last week.”
“Gaw! Wish mine could find a steady job like that.”
clambering up the sharp bank to his
camp. He put his hat over the nugget,
Best be careful, he thought, even in an
empty land.
Two of the cats met him at the entrance
of the shack. From sheet-iron and hes-
sian he had fashioned his dwelling, but
neatly; none of your frowsy ends hang-
ing out! Inside stood a bunk with
folded rugs, a kerosene-case table, with
another case for stool, and a hanging
safe (a bit of swank, the last, Tom had
said). Even a white goat-skin mat lay
on the floor.
The cats went mewing and arching
round their master’s ankles. He stood
for a second staring round ; he’d not ever
realised before how snug it was! “Old
puss,” he muttered automatically. “Good
old puss.” As he stooped to stroke the
animal, half-strangling itself with purrs,
the hat fell from the nugget. Snakey
showed his find to the cats. Told them
all he meant to d 0.... He’d have to
leave them, he thought suddenly. Leave
his camp. Leave Kimberley.
He turned and looked out from the
entrance. The creek-bed, the hills, the
crows, the place where he and Rosie’d
spun yarns and dreamed—of that which
he held at last. He felt his hands begin
to shake. He glanced down. “Wouldn’t
do to drop a fortune,” he told himself
out loud, grinning.
How his hands shook! He looked at
then}. And it was as though he beheld
them for the first time.
God! He was old!
Those withered talons • trembling on
the gold belonged to a deadbeat—
old, old! He couldn’t see those hands
gripping a wallet full of notes! Or
stroking firm warm arms like Rosie’s!
He knew his own hands —brown and
strong they’d been, grasping the flesh of
Rosie’s wrist until she cried: “O-oh, let
go! You’re a wild fellow and no mis-
take” But she’d laughed at him
with her eyes, and afterwards they’d
talked of how they’d spend the money.
Well, she had spent Welch’s instead.
And now these were his hands —these
two poor, sorry-looking mits shaking
under the weight of a bit of gold!
Suddenly he was running down the hill
to the creek. It felt cold and damp.
Above the still pools hung a mist like
fine blue smoke above a pan of boiling
fat. Snakey hunted for his pick. Fur-
tively he peered about. Even the crows
had vanished.
When he regained the camp, the pick
lay in its usual place across his shoulder ;
his free hand hung slack by his side. He
jit the hurricane, and peeped inside. Then
his eyes rose, they swept across the pale
sky, just pricking over with stars. He
shivered a little, and started talking to
the cats.
“To-morrow, maybe—or the next
day,” he muttered. “You never know,
old puss. It’s the thrill what keeps a
bloke going. And there ain’t no better
camp nor ours, puss, and them stars is
like diamonds”
He had been ill for two days before one
of the Chinaman’s piccaninnies found
him. All sunken in and yellow with
malaria Snakey looked by then shiver-
ing and sweating in turns. The Chow
was wondering what to do about it when
a car passed—Government crowd or
something. Anyway, they took the old
fellow into the Mission hospital at the
Creek.
Snakey didn’t remember anything of
that. The first time he came to with any
sense he found himself in a white bed,
“It’s crook, Dave, when you see tradesmen leaving the country like that.”
with sheets, and pillows, sleeping in a
room again after thirty years.... Pic-
tures, too, like Rosie’s room. And there
was a young woman —his heart gave a
great bound
But, of course, it wasn’t Rosie! He
was Snakey Evans, the old fossicker
from Chow’s Garden; and she was a
hospital nurse.
But she looked young and kind. And
her hands felt cool. She patted one of
his. In a detached kind of way he
noticed their two hands lying side by side
on the coverlet. Hands —my God! He
tried to turn over, so she wouldn’t see
the tears he could not keep from his
eyes ; but she had to help him. Then
she left him to sleep—as she thought.
Only he thought about his claim. He
must get back. He tried to remember
what he’d done. Buried a fortune, he
had, because he’d discovered it hadn’t
been gold he’d wanted at all, but the
thrill of hunting for it, the dream of
spending it! Once, perhaps, years ago,
with Rosie, he might have cleared out,
gone back through Hell’s Gate. But he
didn’t know... .he liked the country....
he hadn’t thought Hell’s Gate anything
but a vision of splendor ; he could see
it now, lit by the flaming rays of a rising
sun. Anyhow, why worry? Old hands
couldn’t fling gold about....
Abruptly, it seemed to him, the nurse
leaned over the bed. She’d come back
with an older woman, who held a hypo-
dermic in her hand. Sporting, thought
Snakey mistily, and very decent of
these girls to come out here to mind
fellows.
He didn’t know how glazed his eyes
looked. “Not much hope,” the woman
was whispering. She thought he couldn’t
hear! Well
Suddenly the young nurse stooped.
Snakey felt his head lifted to the soft
warmth of her breast. A firm smooth
hand held a cup to his lips. A low voice
spoke in his ear: “Couldn’t you manage
to sip this.... to please me”
He died an hour later.
The young nurse went out on to the
verandah with wet eyes. She had only
just arrived in the Never-Never. She
spoke softly to her senior.
“Poor lonely old chap,” she murmured.
“Such a nice old man —so clean. Do you
know what he kept saying to me? He
was all the time saying I was young —
like Rosie, he said. And that I could
spend money!
“He’d buried a fortune, he said, just
so as to pretend he hadn’t yet found it!
It was the thrill, he said, that a bloke
really wanted: might be to-day, or to-
morrow, you’d strike it lucky—that sort
of feeling. So he had buried a great
nugget! But if I went and looked
Do you think there would be anything
in it?”
The older woman smiled. “Nothing, at
all, my dear! Delirious. Wandering.
Old Snakey’s been up here forty-seven
years, Snowy Barker told me yesterday.
Simply a case of imagining he had found
the gold he had wasted his whole life
searching f0r”....
The young nurse murmured to herself;
“I wonder? Anyway,” she said aloud,
“he didn’t tell me where to look! ”
Summer Moon.
Why must you tease me, mock me, night by
night
(Who bear rebelliously a prosy yoke)
With glamorous dreams of daring and delight
As transient as breeze-blown rings of smoke?
Your promises of power and renown
Are moon-mirages, taunting as they fade;
And I have yet to bind one vagrant down
Of all th’ exciting visions you have made.
I know it! Yet you weave your time-old snare
Of loveliness long gone and unborn joy,
And I am once again caught unaware;
Tormented and bewildered, like a boy
Who cannot see on high the swallows pass,
Yet tries to pin their shadows to the grass.

The Last Steamer.
Perhaps in nineteen-seventy-six,
Or thereabouts, one day
They’ll load the last steam job with bricks
And blow her bilge away;
And as she, groaning, sinks to rest,
Someone will call to mind
That, by and large, she was the best
And fastest of her kind.
In half a century, or less,
’Tis likely there will be
No funnelled ships, whose names men guess
When they are far at sea.
And in the Talking Tars’ Hotel
Old men will tell queer tales
Of steamers steered by clock and bell,
Which spouted smoke like whales.
“I mind the Huddart, Parker boats,”
A steamer man will wheeze:
“Full fifty feet, their funnels’ throats
Smoked high above the seas;
But, taller still, I will avow,
Was Holt’s blue funnel, which
Was said to trim them by the bow
And make them roll and pitch.”
There’ll be another old hand there —
A deep-sea engineer;
“It was the firemen,” he’ll declare,
“That put the steamers queer.
What with their strikes and tricks and such,
The owners had them set.”
He never loved the firemen much;
He can’t forgive them yet.
And next, the oldest of them all,
McTavish, ripe with rum,
Tells of the days he can recall,
“Before the compounds come.”
“ ’Twas in the ’nineties that they rose
The funnels very high—
Triple expansion, I suppose,
And extry draught was why.”
Ah, well, they sank the last to-day—
I won’t say it was wrong,
For there’ll be vessels soon, they say,
Which we’ll just wish along.
The wind don’t work no more, nor men,
Nor coal, but only 0i1....
I’d like to work on ships again
When wishin’s reckoned toil.

Leisure.
WRITTEN AND ILLUSTRATED BY NORMAN LINDSAY.
AT the age of fifty an awful thing
happened to Piddington. He was
left a legacy of two thousand
pounds a year.
Malice inspired this bequest, which
came from a distant relative in England,
who knew nothing of Piddington and for
that reason bestowed it on him. A known
circle of relatives was thereby deprived
of it.
On Piddington, in distant Sydney, this
benefaction arrived as a catastrophe.
For a week he shook all over with excite-
ment like an overwound mechanical toy,
and his small peaked face twitched with
anxiety while he gabbled to his friend
Dawlish of this terrible acquisition,
stumbling distractedly about his small
dirty flat, which looked like a marine store
that had gone mad and hidden its litter
where no one could ever come to buy it.
“You see how I am situated here,” he
wailed. “The collection of a lifetime. I
began my stamps when I was eight years
old. Now I must take a larger flat. Or
a house. A house, you think. With ser-
vants ; a cook.
“But how to shift my things?” he went
on. “My hawks ; how pack them? Then
all these boxes. There are fifty-seven
candle-boxes in the passage. What’s in
them all I have no idea. I shall have to
sort them out. Impossible! I shall go
mad. The hawks could be carried by
hand. But all my ink-bottles. And then
my resignation! You think I ought to
resign. Then I lose my pension. The
bottles could be carried in bags. But the
hawks”....
This is an age of connoisseurship,
and Piddington exemplified it. He col-
lected rubbish. Not as an intellectual
diversion, but as a primordial craving.
Selection played no part in his passion
for collection. If a standard existed in
his lust for acquisition, it was to acquire
the worthless. A demoralised avidity
made him especially collect what every-
body else threw away.
To enter Piddington’s flat was to dis-
cover yourself in the presence of a mania.
To enter it at all you had to sidle through
an aisle of deal boxes and emerge aghast
into the sitting-room. More boxes, leak-
ing litter, were piled up everywhere.
Mounds of trash, done up in bundles, or
not done up, were crammed on to shelves,
the mantelpiece, the fireplace, or burst
out of cupboards....
It was litter that defied arrangement.
How might eight stuffed hawks, ten
demijohns, two hundred pickle-jars, a
ship model and the wheels of seventeen
perambulators be designed to render a
confined space habitable? But these were
aesthetic intrusions on Piddington’s pas-
sion. He had once bought a hawk at an
auction sale, or found a demijohn in a
back lane, and so was enforced to acquire
more specimens of these.
That was his nuisance ; his desire lived
that it might add duplicate to duplicate.
Once he had found a set of false teeth
in a dustbin, and so tremendous was the
thrill of treasure-trove that it forced him
to buy a lot more false teeth from pawn-
brokers’ shops before he could curb this
too-expensive lust.
Happily, a tradesman’s earth was at
Piddington’s service. Everywhere and
every day one may pick up stamps, post-
cards, pins, tobacco tags, cigar bands,
corks, cigarette cards, ink-bottles, used
nibs —thrills at every walk abroad. Regi-
mental badges and door-handles and
brass curtain-rings are rare, to be sure,
but small sums purchase them in marine
stores. And restaurants make no pro-
scription against a customer carrying off
his oyster-shells. Three candle-boxes of
these in the passage penetrated Pidding-
ton’s flat with the odor of a beach at low
tide.
The flat was never swept; there was
no room to wield a broom in it. And
Piddington knew nothing about women,
even as attachments to a broom. The
brief abortive spasm of his youth had
never discovered that women could be
known. Rubbish sufficed the exercise of
all emotion. And, since rubbish is not
a separable quantity from rubbish, what
sacrilege might not a woman and a
broom commit in his treasure-house of
trash? The needs of his being were to
satisfy a magpie craving and to announce
a disunion of that being with Dawlish.
Rubbish and Dawlish
The friendship between Dawlish and
Piddington was maintained on a system
which disposed of its ingredient of friend-
ship. A rickety little man all atwitter
with nerves and dyspepsia, Piddington
required to complain constantly about
his stomach, and Dawlish aggravated this
need by functioning as the perfect
stomach.
Dawlish renounced nothing, affirmed
nothing. His calm was the spiritual
essence of his gastric juices. He had one
of those fat faces which are shaped like
a pumpkin that is narrow at the top and
bulges at the bottom. It was devoid of
all expression save at meal-times, when
his eyes bolted a little, as astonished at
the excellence of food.
Piddington, meagre as a lizard and
aware of evil lurking in edible sub-
stances, always found the spectacle of
Dawlish feeding intolerable.
“You eat too much —too much! If
you knew the effect of pouring tea on
meat. Frightful! There, I knew it—
two helpings of jam pudding. Look at
me —a slice of whiting and a rusk”....
Dawlish never paid the slightest atten-
tion to Piddington ; that was the endur-
ing content of their friendship. For
twenty years those two had worked in
the same Government office, lunched
daily together, walked out together on
Sunday afternoons and Sunday nights,
played cards together. On that event they
drank whisky together, an allowance of
three glasses administered by Piddington
as an act of rebellion to an imperially
dyspeptic stomach. This Sabbath de-
bauch conferred great martyrdom on
Piddington, and was very necessary to his
“Eight stuffed hawks, ten demijohns, two hundred pickle-jars, a ship model
and the wheels of seventeen perambulators ... .were cesthetic intrusions on
Piddington’s passion.”
theme of complaint against life and
Dawlish.
.... “If you knew what I suffer. No
breakfast. And now, hardly equal to a
rusk. It is entirely your fault. You
insist on having whisky. Don’t deny it.
But I am resolved —no more whisky”....
Speech with Dawlish was no system
for the exchange of opinion. He used
it only for comment on authentic fact.
Thus he might say to Piddington’s rant-
ing, “As nice a bit of undercut as ever
I ate” or “That steak wasn’t hung long
enough—got to hang steak.”
Piddington’s passion for rubbish was
accepted fact to Dawlish. By long prac-
tice he knew how to wheedle his bulk
into Piddington’s flat and find a seat
among its litter. If there was rubbish
on the seat, he sat on it. If Piddington
found him so seated, he snatched him
upright in a fury and removed the rub-
bish with cries of pain. Dawlish, quite
unmoved, reseated himself, obtuse to a
ruined matchbox held quiveringly under
his nose. Betimes a dim effect of bulg-
ing attended his contemplation of Pid-
dington counting his pickle-jars, or mak-
ing a precise inventory of cigar bands,
but opinion failed to rumble in him.
He had grown to middle age with these
hybrid offsprings of Piddington’s pas-
sion, and accepted Piddington’s exulta-
tion over them as the evidence of their
value.
Thus it was with Piddington when
wealth fell on him like a high explosive
and scattered the rubbish-heap under
which the roots of his existence lay
buried. He wailed of cataclysm to Daw-
lish but succumbed to it. At the com-
mand of a ruthless edict that money must
be served he resigned from the office,
took a house in a harbor suburb, packed
his rubbish and left the flat where he had
lived for twenty years.
He packed his rubbish. That is to
compress an exercise of frenzy into the
hopeless metier of words. His mounds
defied any assortment of themselves into
order or classification, and his efforts to
detach regimental badges and false teeth
and curtain rings from a million tobacco
tags and used nibs made him utter dis-
tracted outcries far into the night. In
the end they were bundled anyhow back
into boxes on the day of their removal,
and Piddington darted about among the
carriers uttering frantic expostulations as
his treasure went bumping downstairs.
Dawlish arrived from the office to find
him collapsed on the floor, done for with
dust, despair and perspiration, and in
that state led him forth to be restored
by whisky.
“For the present the collection must
be stored in the stable—ffie stable,” said
Piddington, weeping, “till I can find room
for it in the house—the house”.. ..
The house —the entrance by which
Piddington made exit from Piddington.
An agent procured it for him, an em-
porium furnished it, and a labor bureau
found a cook and housemaid for it.
Piddington entered it as an interloper and
dwelt in it by stealth.
Everything in it was so new, so shin-
ing. By no act of his own will he
found himself possessed of oak furni-
ture, marble-topped washstands, leather-
covered chairs, beds of brass and iron,
couches, carpets and linoleums, and a
kitchen full of shining utensils. A neat
garden enclosed it without, and from
within its order was maintained by a
meticulous cooking of food and the re-
moval of dust from shining surfaces.
For the rest, one slept in its brass-and-
iron beds, one ate at its oak tables, and
one stood among its shining surfaces, or
walked upstairs in order to walk down
again.
And all the while one’s treasure re-
mained in the stable where the carters
had dumped it.
At times Piddington would go stealthily
to the stable and stand forlornly staring
at the piled-up boxes, softly groaning.
But he never acquired courage to un-
pack even his stamp album. Where in
that crapulous hoard might a stamp
album be buried? Once he lugged down
a hawk and carried it about the house,
looking for a place to put it. There was
no place. The spotless surfaces of his
house rejected this mouldering relic, and
in the end he carried it back to the
stable.
It was an act of self-abnegation ; a
renunciation of Piddington by Pidding-
ton ; the death of dirt. Twitching and
fidgeting about his shining house, Pid-
dington became aware of dirt as its one
disturbing feature. Furtively he would
take out his handkerchief and dust a
surface.
Presently, it was not enough to make
a secret inspection of the house when the
housemaid had done her morning job.
He found that treacheries were being
practised. Dust was allowed to accu-
mulate on skirting-boards, shelves, the
tops of cupboards, and he began to over-
look the work himself, sometimes in-
truding a fussy act of criticism with a
dustcloth.
There were words over that and the
housemaid went, but another replaced
her. Piddington hardly noticed a change
of identity in these wenches, but he
became rigorous in overseeing their
methods, and housemaids were a peri-
patetic order in that house. No matter ;
between their goings and comings he did
the sweeping and dusting himself, and
regretted handing over a sacred ritual to
another incompetent.
So much for mornings. In the after-
noons Piddington took a ferry-boat across
to the city and walked about the streets
with an anxious eye on the pavements.
But he picked up no more pins or
tobacco tags or cigar bands. Sometimes
he made a furtive dive at some such
object, but arrested the guilty impulse in
time....
Only at the windows of secondhand
shops vague stirrings of acquisitiveness
rose and died within him. Their jumble
of old furniture and bric-a-brac dis-
turbed a conflict between dust and
dusters within him. He wished to polish
up these old things, but there was no
point where taste might liberate a desire
to possess. At the marine stores he
lingered with a secret emotion of shame,
feeling a mysterious kinship with the
rusty, dusty litter in their windows.
Nothing came of these
jaunts, which seemed prompt-
ed by a quest that never
defined itself. Always he
hurried home from them
with the air of a man pressed
for time, searching the pave-
ments but never picking up
anything.
For wealth gave Pidding-
ton no assurance that it could
be used. Its value still re-
mained that of a pittance de-
rived from working in an
office. From an illusion of
riches it had evolved one tan-
gible reality: his house of
shining surfaces, requiring
the incessant removal of dust.
Dawlish, stoical at his
friend’s fortune, still for-
mally pervaded the new ex-
istence, but now only on Sun-
days, when he came from his
boarding-house in a distant
suburb to dine in state with Piddington.
He came, torpid and unruffled, but it was
clear that wealth had greatly stimulated
his perception of accredited facts, for,
where he had gaped owlishly at Pidding-
ton’s rubbish, he now exhibited a bovine
approval of the polished furniture.
“How much did that stand you in?”
he would ask. Being told, he would
make a succulent sound, as if the price
tasted well.
They played cards as usual, but with-
out the spiritual stimulus of debauch,
because Piddington had now substituted
cocoa for whisky. “With all this excite-
ment, this responsibility, I require seda-
tives. I must consider my nerves.
Whisky is too disturbing”....
The disturbed factor was Piddington’s
misplaced sense of acquisitiveness. In
the old days Dawlish had always bought
the whisky, but they had divided the
cost. Now it lay with Piddington to sup-
port this expense. He kept wine in the
house, but rarely opened a bottle, except
to dole out two small glasses of port
after dinner. But he always protested,
“This wine is very expensive. And too
rich. I must give it up”
Nor did the exhilaration of gambling
attend their Sunday night’s game. They
played for penny points, but Piddington
could no longer rant like a fishwife at
Dawlish over the score. He had at least
got beyond pennies....
In fact, he betrayed a fidgety desire to
get the game over so that at the stroke
of eleven Dawlish might be bustled out
of the house in time to catch his boat.
For Dawlish was an intrusion on The
House. In the flat, his place had been
an act of collaboration with its sacred
rubbish ; in the house, there was no place
for him in its sacred routine of getting
rid of rubbish. Moreover, he threw


cigar-ash on the floor This, under his
very nose, was swept up by Piddington
into a dustpan. Nor was Dawlish thereby
abashed into grovellings of contrition.
He continued to make his frankly abor-
tive offerings of cigar-ash at the fireplace,
thereby scattering it over the hearthrug
and keeping Piddington seething activity
with the dustpan.
Dawlish was not one to allow a dust-
pan to disturb his gastric calm. Human
antics had nothing to do with his con-
templation of accredited facts. Neverthe-
less, he began to be aware of certain
actions of Piddington’s a little in excess
of normal peevishness. Trifles, perhaps,
but still vaguely disturbing to his flaccid
calm, like thumb-marks on dough.
There was the affair of the new straw
hat, for example. Dawlish had arrived
with it on his head, like a piedish on a
pudding. He had placed it carefully on
the hallstand and entered the front room.
Piddington hurried downstairs and was
heard to exclaim with exasperation,
“How came this thing here?”
From the window Dawlish was con-
founded to see his hat whiz over the
front garden fence into the road.
Piddington made no apology when the
hat, diminished of newness, was retrieved
by a frowning Dawlish. “You never used
to wear straw hats,” was all he said
severely, as marking an instance of be-
havior in Dawlish not to be condoned.
And again, while they waited for din-
ner, Piddington said sternly, “You’ve
been moving the mantel ornaments.”
“Wad yer mean?” demanded Dawlish.
Without saying a word, Piddington
took a foot-rule from the sideboard
drawer and made some very exact
measurements between the various mantel
ornaments, followed in this exercise by
the stertorous breathing of Dawlish.
“Half an inch out,” said Piddington,
turning on Dawlish a face quite pale with
apprehension.
Dawlish got as far as saying “How
d’yer mean, out?” when Piddington
pushed him rudely into a chair and took
his own seat at table. But he was no
sooner there than he leaped up to point
a quivering finger at the tablecloth.
“Look at that!” he exclaimed.
Dawlish looked. On the tablecloth
there was not so much as a soup-stain.
“Look at what?” he demanded.
With every mark of agitation Pidding-
ton leaned over and smoothed out a
wrinkle in the cloth, overlooked by
Dawlish with a confounded eye.
“If I was as pertickler as that! ” he
said, and gave it up.
But Piddington’s conduct refused to
permit a giving-up of eccentric conun-
drums disturbing to an interlude of gas-
tric calm. All the while they were at cards
he kept stooping to peer under the table,
or he would go on tiptoes to the door and
look suddenly into the passage. At the
stroke of ten he said sternly to Dawlish,
“Your time’s up,” and darted to the
passage to thrust Dawlish’s hat on him.
And he greatly accelerated the stertorous
breathing of that friend by saying,
“Touch nothing as you go out,” and
watched him off the premises as police-
men watch a notorious malefactor.
By the time Dawlish had crossed the
harbor and climbed aboard his tram and
was half-way home he discovered that
Piddington’s conduct had been distinctly
offensive that evening. By the time he
had reached home and climbed into his
pyjamas and ruminated darkly for twenty
minutes, he had arrived at the correct
retort on it.
“Damned if I’ll go out there again,”
he said.
And for three Sundays he stayed away
from Piddington, and felt indignant and
ill-used by a decision which enforced
disruption on the habits of twenty years.
Piddington made nothing of it. He
had other things to think about; things
which kept him polishing away at his
house in a secret frenzy, or sent him
hasting through the streets to keep an
appointment that vanished at every street
corner. Past pins and tobacco tags he
sped, under a taboo that must not let
him look at one of them. It let him
linger at the secondhand shops, darting
swift, furtive glances over their lumber
that looked for something which was
never there.
But he made a purchase at one of
those shops before he had time to think
about it. The dealer of that shop was
showing a set of Japanese swords to a
tall man with a disdainful nose. Pid-
dington feigned to study a New Guinea
mask in order to overhear barter in
mysterious values.
“I’ve given up swords,” said the tall
man, refusing to look at them.
“But these are from Hitchen’s collec-
tion,” protested the dealer. “They’re old
and dated. Have a look at them, any-
way.”
Bored, the tall man picked out a sword,
glanced at the hilt, balanced it a moment
and dropped it back.
“Average sixteenth-century specimen,”
he said. “What do you want for it?”
“Five pounds, to you,” said the dealer.
The tall man laughed, as at a tolerably
poor joke, and passed out. But Pidding-
ton had noted his intent scrutiny of the
hilt that marked the maker’s name, and
divined that his pose of indifference was
the legitimate by-play of barter.
“I’ll take that sword,” he said abruptly.
Or did he say it? But it was wrapped
up and paid for and he found himself
hurrying through the streets with it,
exultant and confused. All the way home
he twitched with impatience to get it
safely into the house, and there his fingers
were in such a fever that he could hardly
unwrap it. Acquisitiveness had found its
spiritual objective—a future bright with
collecting these mysterious swords. But
their expense appalled him, and he was
tormented by a conflict of two lusts. In
the end he hung the sword over the
mantelpiece and spent the evening staring
at it.
But he kept away from the secondhand
shops; a taboo had put them out of
bounds. He stayed at home, overseeing
the housemaid, and when the wench had
done her jobs he did them all over again ;
upstairs, downstairs, a flighty patter of
slippered feet and the flapping of a dust-
cloth.
“Listen to the old grouch!” said the
enraged housemaid to the cook. “He’s
got bugs in his garret”....
“He threw himself sideways and came, heavily to the floor as the Japanese
sword flicked past his shoulder and bit into the table edge beside his plate.”
A crude diagnosis. Dawlish found it
otherwise, pondering darkly in his
boarding-house on those captions which
account for the notorious scorn of
wealth.
“Show’s what money’ll do to a man,”
said Dawlish.
But on the fourth Sunday a rhythm of
years prevailed over the vague rumblings
of self-esteem, and he presented him-
self on Piddington’s doorstep, porten-
tously staring.
“I knew it,” was all Piddington said,
as if the return of Dawlish was a fore-
gone conclusion for which all arrange-
ments had been made. .
As pending those, his air was one of
marked reserve. While waiting dinner he
observed Dawlish distantly as one who
had offended, but on whose offence judg-
ment pended. As a rule Piddington
fussed about, peevishly monologuing,
ejecting complaints about life at Dawlish
as if he was responsible for it. There-
fore his present reserve left Dawlish ster-
torously breathing. He had conceived
that Piddington would demand an ex-
planation of his absence for three Sun-
days, and was prepared for him there.
“Having it out” was the term Dawlish
used for that event. But Piddington kept
it in.
At table he maintained the distance of
a host entertaining an inevitable but not
desired guest. Nor were the gastric
decencies intruded on by peculiar antics.
Beyond drawing up his knees with a
shiver and peering urgently under the
table, Piddington ate a reassuring amount
of food. Ate with avidity, too, which
was not like his usual pecking over dishes
and complaining of their evil effects.
Yet Dawlish found the event not satis-
factory, though the dinner was good and
he ate largely. That suspended explana-
tion kept disturbing his gastric processes.
It occurred to him that perhaps Pidding-
ton’s reserve waited for him to open the
matter. He had reached that point in
his ruminations when Piddington got up
and went round to the fireplace, where
he turned, to observe that Dawlish was
looking at him.
“Attend to your food!” shouted Pid-
dington fiercely.
Dawlish looked with astonishment at
his plate, which was empty, and back at
Piddington, who came to the table and
pushed the nuts and raisins at his guest.
“Eat those!” he commanded.
Dawlish found this request on the
whole reasonable. He cracked a walnut
and extracted the kernel and munched,
watched by Piddington with a domineer-
ing eye.
“Have some port wine,” he said, in
the same bullying way.
“Don’t mind if I do,” confessed
Dawlish.
Piddington kept his wine in the side-
board. But, instead of going to the side-
board, he went to the fireplace. Without
doubt Dawlish’s wits were working at
high pressure that evening. In the act
of cracking a nut he decided to look
round. His next act was not one of
decision but blind self-preservation. He
threw himself sideways and came heavily
to the floor as the Japanese sword flicked
past his shoulder and bit into the table
edge beside his plate.
With corpulent sprawlings, like a dis-
tracted beetle, Dawlish fled round the
table and there rose, his eyes bolting, his
breath whistling and his fat face flabby
with horror. Impossible! But there was
the sword still gently quivering and Pid-
dington gaping at him with a dropped
jaw and a feebly glazing eye, as aghast
as Dawlish at a confounded anti-climax.
Then in a flash Piddington’s face
crinkled up like a squeezed lemon and his
knee-joints kinked outward and he col-
lapsed on the carpet, weeping bitterly.
With bulbous glarings and breathless
breathings Dawlish came stealthily round
the table and detached the sword. This,
after a moment of owlish irresolution,
he carried gingerly to the door and cast
into the passage. Then he came back
and went on staring at the grovelling Pid-
dington, quite unable to assure his eye of
credibility.
“Wad yer do that for?” he asked at
length.
This question achieved for him a per-
ception of what Piddington had tried to
do, and the lines of his fat face, unused
to bizarre exercise, assumed the propor-
tions of an overboiled pudding. Awful
things had burst upon it.
“Tried to murder me,” said Dawlish.
“Actually tried t 0”....
His tongue failed to repeat an impos-
sible word, but dumbfounded self-esteem
had to find an explosion point some-
where.
“Wad d’yer mean by it?” he thundered.
Piddington shook all over at this
relentless insistence. Snuffling and gulp-
ing, he crawled to an armchair and col-
lapsed into it, while Dawlish swelled and
swelled and again reached stentorian
bursting point.
“What made you do it?”
Unexpectedly Piddington answered
that.
“7/ did,” he quavered.
“Wad d’yer mean- —it?”
That took some answering. There were
quaverings, mumblings, fresh weepings
before Piddington emerged into what
appeared to be a feeble exasperation at
Dawlish.
“You are so unsympathetic, so —so
fat,” he said. “You should never have
come to this house.”
He got up shakily and looked behind
the chair.
“Not there,” he said.
Dawlish also looked behind the chair.
“What’s not there?” he demanded.
“///” screeched Piddington in a sud-
den fury. “The thing that is in this
house ; the thing that won’t let me alone ;
the thing that won’t let me do anything.”
His small peaked face was convulsed
with rage and he hooked his clawed
lingers at Dawlish, to hook understand-
ing out of his fat foolish carcass.
“You don’t understand. This house—
so clean, so new, so polished; how was
it possible to have dust in it? This
thing ; it wanted dust. Now I know ; it
came in the dirty boxes with my collec- •
tion. Perhaps it was there all those
years; how do I know? But happy,
contented. In this new house there was
no place for it; no dust. It was enraged.
When there was any dust here, it made
little marks in it, just to show it was
here. For a long time I was not sure ;
but I watched. Always where there was
dust, little angry marks. So I polished
everything; no dust. Then it became
very angry and began to move things ;
chairs, ornaments. To make disorder.
I measured everything to keep the places
exact. That made it so angry that it
began to whisper in my ear”....
Piddington looked sharply behind him
with a shiver.
“There, you cannot catch it; always
just behind the head. When I went out,
it went with me, always whispering, ‘Pick
it up.’ Pins, matchboxes, anything. Im-
possible ; how could I bring such things
into my house? Whenever 1 came to a
rubbish-tin it was terrible, wanting me to
carry home jamtins, pickle-jars, any-
thing.
“Impossible! Pickle-jars among all
my handsome ornaments. When it found
that I would not have them, it became
terrible. It tried to drive me out of the
house, so that dust would settle on every-
thing and it could be happy. It or me.
It never let me alone, always whisper-
ing, threatening. ‘I will leap on your
back in the dark; bite your bare toes;
stick pins in you under the table’
Sometimes I dared not go to bed ; some-
times I have sat here all night with my
toes on a chair for fear it would nip
them, -sitting here for hours and hours
and hours”....
Piddington wept, hunched up in the
armchair, and Dawlish’s stare at this
drivelling recital was almost as bemused
as its subject-matter. But now he re-
called that a crime still waited investiga-
tion.
“All very well, all this It business,”
he said. “What about trying to murder
me?”
Piddington exhaled fury and despair.
“You don’t understand. How could this
thing live here where there was no dust
and dirt to make it happy? Why not
in the stable with my collection ? What
kept it in my nice clean house?
“Then I saw. Nothing from that old
dirty life but you. You! You would
come. When I bought the sword I
understood everything. Kill Dawlish and
kill It. One stroke, and it was ended.
But you moved. You moved,” said Pid-
dington, weeping. “And now I will never
get rid of it—never.”
If Dawlish could have achieved the
dimensions of a balloon just then, his
mighty anger would have filled it. These
tears and grovellings, then, were not of
repentance, but of grief for having failed
to do for him. He swelled and swelled
and reddened and bulged, but speech
came not from him. What speech could
encompass an unmentionable conspiracy
to deprive him of gastric juice for ever?
With one final stare of combustion at
Piddington he bumped into the hall,
thumped on his hat and banged out of
the house, presenting to the night an
affixture of immortal affront.
“Last time you’ll see me in that house ”
said Dawlish, and so consigned Pidding-
ton to its evil habitat for ever.

Minor Adjustments.
BY V. M. LIPSCOMB.
AMONG garage men Jacob Selby had
the name of being hard. Some of
his customers said he was a
shrewd head; a few pronounced him a
sanguinary old scoundrel. Therefore his
spare part (unpaid), Tommy Bell, was
ready to run for cover when Tommy re-
ported, “I told the bloke you wanted a
hundred for that Three-Star, and he said
you could go and bite your back ; eighty-
five’s all he’s got.”
The atmosphere remained serene,
lacob had had the car on his hands for
some time, and was beginning to be-
grudge it garage space. “Mr. Harney
wants seventy,” he mused; “all over
that’s mine. Lucky if I got eighty.
That’d be a tenner. Not bad, considering
I’ve sold him new tubes all round.”
Of Tommy he asked, “What do you
want if I let it go for eighty-five?”
“Seeing that he came to me, I think a
fiver’s a fair thing.”
Jacob’s hands flew skyward. “And
I’m dropping fifteen!”
“Bullswool! ” declared Tommy. “What
you’d drop it’d take a bloke with a
microscope to find.”
“Righto,” grunted Jacob. “Trot the
joker along.”
Tommy trotted him along. It was
plain the joker didn’t know much about
cars. As he circled the Three-Star Jacob
eyed him scornfully. “Mibb’s his name,”
he muttered; “it should be MUG. What
he doesn’t know would fill a book! ”
Mr. Mibb produced a roll of notes.
“She’s worth eighty-five,” he said.
“The fiver goes to Tommy for intro-
ducing you,” said Jacob.
“That’s sporting of you, Mr. Selby,”
exclaimed Mr. Mibb, as he handed the
note to Tommy. “And one good turn
deserves another, so I’ll garage the car
with you.”
Jacob having assured him that he
would have the registration papers next
day, Mr. Mibb decided to chance being
pulled up and to take Tommy for a
drive.
As he watched them go Jacob grinned
broadly. “MUG is right! ” he mused ;
“bet he brags for the rest of his life
about how he beat the garage man down
fifteen pounds. And he’s going to garage
it here to do me a good turn! ” Jacob’s
grin developed into a laugh. “There’ll
be minor adjustments made on the Three
Star!”
“Minor adjustments” played a big part
in Jacob’s business of selling second-
hand cars. “Now, about minor adjust-
ments,” he would say to the customer
when a deposit had been paid. “We’Jl
go over her and see everything is all right.
Leave her to us.”
The customer having “left her,” Jacob
would make his “minor adjustments.”
No car that came into his garage had
anything so bad that he could not replace
it with something worse. Tyres, tubes,
batteries, bulbs, sparking plugs—Jacob
took toll of them all, giving older stuff
for old—and new.
The “minor adjustments” having been
made, and the car sold, “We’ve been over
her, and she’s running beautifully,” he
would say. “No charge for that; that’s
' service. We do that so that when you
want anything you’ll come back to us.”
Some of the customers did come back.
And when one of them poked under
lacob’s nose a tube that was little more
than odd bits of its original rubber held
together with patches, or drew his atten-
tion to a battery in an advanced stage
of disintegration, Jacob would shake his
head sadly and say, “I know it wasn’t
there when you made your inspection;
but what can we do? A man puts his
car here for us to sell. Naturally, he
drops in occasionally to look at it. We
can’t follow him round to see if he’s
ringing any changes; we just have to
trust him.
“Worst of it is, you can’t do anything.
I was caught like that once. My solicitor
told me I had no case, nothing to prove
I hadn’t changed the things myself. It
was the other man’s word against mine.
I don’t suggest you’ve done that; I’m
only putting the legal aspect of it.”
Having seen that the legal aspect was
fully appreciated, he would discover that
he had a tube, a battery or whatever it
might be that would just fit; he’d sell it
cheap.
“Must give Mr. MUG his service,”
Jacob chuckled; “he’s entitled to it!”
The new tubes he had put in for Mr.
Harney would come out, and the old
ones go back. “Profit coming and going.”
And the battery —the Three-Star had
a brand-new battery out of his stock in
it. He had hired its own out, and had
had to put the new one in when a cus-
tomer came unexpectedly. “Lucky I re-
membered”—
“Good morning, Mr. Selby. Where’s
the car?”
Jacob came out of his dreams. Before
him stood Mr. Harney.
“Cold snap to-day, Billy.”
“I don’t feel it, boss. Blackpfeller civilised, you see. Whitepfeller gone native.”
“Blast him!” muttered Jacob under
his breath. Aloud he said “Out on a
demonstration,” sparring for time to con-
sider whether it was worth while trying
to make Harney believe he had got only
seventy for the car.
“What’s the offer?” asked Mr. Harney.
“I’m trying to get seventy-five, but”
“Don’t try any more. I can get a
hundred. The man who wants it thinks
it is a different car. You see, I’ve had
two Three-Stars. Same model, same
color, same extras. To look at them,
you couldn’t tell the difference. This
chap knew the first one well. He doesn’t
know that this is a re-bored job. ‘A
hundred —take it, or leave it,’ he said.
So you can chase your buyer away. We’ll
be along in' the morning. My offer to
you stands, of course; all over seventy
is yours. This smart Aleck can pay you
thirty—because he’s so smart.”
Long after Mr. Harney had gone Jacob
stood staring into space. “Thirty quid!”
he gasped at last. “Twenty quid chucked
away! Damn Tommy!” Could he get
the Three-Star back? Would Mibb listen
to reason? If Mibb wouldn’t, MUG
would.
Jacob was waiting to close the place
when Mibb returned. He smiled when
he saw Mibb was alone. “You had me
worried,” he said, when Mr. Mibb had
apologised for being so late ; “I’ve had
the owner of that car in to-day, and he
went for me for letting it out. He’s
changed his mind about selling. Said he
wrote to me, withdrawing it; I didn't
get any letter. So I’ll have to give you
your money back.”
Mibb protested that he didn’t want his
money back, he wanted the car. The
owner be hanged. He’d see the owner
in the morning and tell him he’d bought
and paid for the car.
Jacob put on his most soothing
manner. “As this is my mistake,” he
said, “I’ll give you two quid on your
bargain. How’ll that do?”
Mibb supposed it would have to do.
Grumbling, he took his money and
Jacob’s £2 and departed.
Jacob was at the garage early next
morning. He wanted to attend to the
battery in the Three-Star. He had
scarcely got in when Harney arrived.
“Given a lift,” Harney explained.
Jacob was wondering how he could
get rid of Harney when Harney called
him. Harney was staring at a flat tyre on
the Three-Star.
“Better get it fixed before the buyer
comes,” Harney advised.
“I always hated tyres,” remarked
Harney as he watched Jacob drag a tyre
from its rim. “Hell’s delight! What’s
that thing?”
Jacob had pulled from the cover an
object which might have been a tube
before something happened to it.
Harney snatched it from him. “What’s
this game?” he thundered. “I buy new
tubes from you, see them put in, and
this is what I find. What have you to
say?”
Jacob could only gaze fascinated at
the relic he had brought to light. Came
the thought: “Where there’s one there’s
more,” and he burst forth: “The
crooks! They swapped ’em yesterday!”
“Swapped ’em!” echoed Harney. “See
here ; all those tyres are coming off, and
new tubes are going in in place of that
rubbish. Now get to ’em.”
Jacob was already getting to ’em. He
wanted to know the worst quickly. He
found that every wheel and the spare
rim had received attention.
When he had seen the new tubes in
place Harney got into the car. “My
friend should be here any moment,” he
said ; “I’ll warm her up.”
He pressed the starter. Nothing hap-
pened. He pressed it again. Again noth-
ing happened. Before he had got pro-
perly out of the seat Jacob had torn away
the cushion. “My best battery gone,”
he almost said as he surveyed the con-
traption in the battery-box.
Harney lifted the bonnet of the car.
“The engine is there still,” he remarked
relievedly.
Jacob didn’t hear him. He had caught
sight of Tommy Bell at the door. “Get
out of this!” he yelled. “You and your
thieving crowd!”
Tommy looked nasty. “What’s bit
you?” he growled.
“Where did you go with Mibb yester-
day?” Jacob demanded.
“Nowhere. He picked up a mate, and
they dropped me at my sheila’s place.
Said they’d come back, but they
didn’t.”
“Hang your sheila!” snorted Jacob.
“Well, that sale to Mibb is off, so you
owe me a fiver.”
“Tell me what to use for money, and
I’ll pay you,” retorted Tommy.
Before Jacob could say
more Harney called to him:
“I’ll ring this chap, and see
what time he’ll be here.
There’s that battery, you
know”
Jacob went with him to
the telephone. From the
door Tommy watched them
interestedly.
Harney talked awhile, then
jambed down the receiver.
“Well, I’ll be damned!” he
exclaimed. “He’s not going
to buy the car. He says his
wife has got to have an
operation; he’ll need the
money for that.”
It seemed to Tommy that
what Jacob said then was
wholly foul language. By
the time he finished swearing,
Harney, helped by a boy,
was pushing his car out of
the garage.
Tommy waited only long
enough to hear Harney men-
tion something about police,
and say he’d run over Jacob
if Jacob didn’t get out of the
way.
“I’ve been robbed right
and left,” Jacob roared ; but
Tommy had fled.
He came back that night.
“What was the strength of your joke
about the sale to Mibb being off?” he
inquired of Jacob.
Jacob was afflicted with deafness.
“I’m asking you,” Tommy continued,
“because I saw him driving the car in
town this afternoon. That bloke Harney
was with him. Car stopped in front of
a tyre place, and I went in looking for
Mibb. He said he’d no time to talk to
me —too busy. He was selling some tubes
to the tyre man.”
Jacob reached for a hammer. “If
you’re not out of here in five seconds”
Beatitude.
Blessed are the makers, the makers of laughter!
How I have loved them: how I have cherished
Minutes they made with the elves and the
pixies;
Minutes they made with the sparkling of water:
The wine in the flagon; the fire on the rafter —
Bless you for angels, O Makers of Laughter!

Nearly everyone knows that CONSTIPATION will make
you feel dull and listless, mentally as well as physically
• . . and as a result of this dread complaint a major opera-
tion may have to be performed.
Nowadays business men must be keen-minded * • • and
therefore it is necessary to be healthy.
P.B.S. CAUSES CONSTIPATION
I P- B.sTj (Poisoned Blood Stream) causes CON-
STIPATION. It is a condition brought about by the
incomplete functioning of liver, kidneys and howels with
the result that poisons which should be eliminated from
the system enter the blood stream. The blood stream
carries these poisons right through the system setting up
such complaints as CONSTIPATION, RHEUMATISM,
NERVOUS DISORDERS, BACKACHE, HEADACHES,
etc,
HERE IS THE REMEDY
Schumann’s Miner/al Spring Salts, which are made from
the active ingredients of the Mineral Springs or Spa
waters of Europe, are nature’s eliminant for poisons in
the Blood Stream. Just take a small dose in a long
glass of warm water each morning . . . and you will
immediately notice the difference.

TAKE SCHUMANN'S REGULARLY
Even if you think you are well ... it is systematically
necessary to internally cleanse your system regularly. Do
this by the safe, efficient method of a regular morning
dose of Schumann’s Mineral Spring Salts in a long tumbler
of warm water.
Remember there is no substitute for Schumann’s.

Information Sought*
What was the decision arrived at by the Aus-
tralian Bowling Council in 1925 in regard to
the size and weight of bowls ? —8226.
It decided that all bowls should in future be
standardised by the table test ; that all, what-
ever their material, should conform to a stand-
ard shape, and that the maximum weight for a
given major diameter should be determined
according to a fixed scale, the maximum for a
ball of 5 3-16 in. diameter being 31b. Boz.,
for a ball of 4 7-Bin. diameter 31b. 20z., and
for intermediate sizes in proportion. A varia-
tion of l-32in. is allowed either way, and the
diameter between discs must be from 7-16 in.
to -jin. less than the major diameter.
I have read that the future controllers of the
world’s food supply will be those nations pos-
sessing phosphate deposits. (1) Are there any
large deposits, excepting Nauru and Ocean
islands ? (2) Are there any deposits being
worked, or which have been worked, in Aus-
tralia ? (3) Composition of phosphate rock ?
(4) How to test and analyse ? (5) Its geolo-
gical formation ? —9045.
(1) Yes. Deposits in America are estimated
at 6500 million tons; in North Africa, 2500
million tons; and in Morocco, 1500 million
tons. (2) Small deposits of low-grade phosphate
have been found, principally in South Australia.
'The production has not been of commercial
importance, and in recent years has amounted
to less than 100 tons p.a. (3), (4) and (5) Refer
to “Principles and Practice of Agricultural
Analysis,” by W. H. Wiley; “Fertilisers and
Manures,” by A. D. Hall; “Phosphoric Acid
and Phosphatic Fertilisers,” by W. H. Wagga-
man and H. W. Easterwood; and “The Ameri-
can Fertilizer Handbook,” published annually.
(1) Is there any patent out in Australia for
dubbin ? If not, could I patent it and manu-
facture it ? (2) Would I have to register as a
company ? —9130.
(1) The first requirement for a patent is
originality. Dubbin is a simple compound of
oil and tallow, and no patent exists or could be
obtained for it. Anybody can make it and
sell it. (2) No.
(1) What relatives may be called upon to
contribute towards the cost of a pension paid
to an old-age pensioner ? Must such relatives
make a declaration as to earnings, and can
they offer a regular voluntary contribution ?
(2) What happens if a relative, when called
upon, makes no proposal to contribute or
makes an unsatisfactory proposal ? (3) Are
any contributions made by a relative deducted
from the amount of the claim on the pen-
sioner’s estate at death ? —9238.
(1) Any person being the husband, wife,
father, mother or child (over 21 years of age)
of a pensioner, who is in a position to do so,
may be called upon to submit a proposal in
writing for a voluntary contribution towards
the cost of the pension paid to the pensioner,
or to furnish a declaration as to his means and
ability to contribute. If the relative makes
a satisfactory proposal, the Deputy Commis-
sioner is empowered to accept from him an
undertaking to contribute. (2) The relative
may be summoned before a magistrate, and
mav be ordered to make a contribution at
such a rate as the Court thinks fit, but not
exceeding the whole cost of the pension. Any
such proceeding before a magistrate will be
heard privately and not in public. (3) Yes.

Straduari.” (1) In what years did Stradivarius
make violins ? (2) As far as is known, how
many were made ? (3) What is the approxi-
mate value of a Strad. to-day ? (4) Is there
any likelihood of mine being a genuine one ?
—9126. . , „
(1) Stradivarius violins date from 1666 to
1737, the year of the maker’s death. (2) 1036.
(3) Anything up to £lO,OOO, according to the
period and its preservation. (4) No. The manu-
facture of fakes labelled like yours has been
going on for over a hundred .years, and there
must be a million of them in circulation.
(1) Highest and lowest temperatures recorded
in England ? (2) Maximum wind velocity on
record in England ? —9205.
(1) Highest shade temperature, lOOdeg. Fahr.,
at Salisbury, July 15, 1881, and at Greenwich
on August 9, 1911; lowest shade temperature,
minus 23deg. Fahr., or 55deg. below freezing
point, at Blackadder, Berwickshire, on Decem-
ber 4, 1879. (2) 111 m.p.h. at Scilly on De-
cember 6, 1929.
Description of Pentecost Island in the New
Hebrides ? —9204. .
It is 28 miles long and 7| miles wide, well
watered, well wooded and fertile. A consider-
able number of white planters and 7000 natives
live there.
Are visitors to England subjected to a land-
ing tax ? How long can they remain there
before they have to pay income tax ? —9127.
No landing tax. The question of income
tax does not arise for a visitor in respect of
income arising from sources outside the U.K.
until he has been six months in the country
in any income-tax year ending April 5, unless
he visits regularly year after year for substan-
tial periods or maintains a residence. A visi-
tor not domiciled in the U.K. who does be-
come chargeable is liable not on the whole of
his income arising abroad, but only on so
much of that income as is received in or re-
mitted to the U.K.
Particulars concerning the R.V.I.A. War
Memorial Scholarship ? —9233.
Value £5O per annum. Open in the first
instance to students who can show that their
architectural education has suffered through
the loss of a relative at the war ; to those
who are returned soldiers or sons of returned
soldiers; to students of architecture generally.
Candidates must be students in the course for
the Diploma of Architecture or enrolled at the
Architectural Atelier. The scholarship money
may be utilised for the payment of Uni. fees,
for expenses of travelling to other States, for
extending knowledge of architecture or attend-
ing courses of instruction, or for travelling
abroad for extending knowledge. Applications
must be lodged with the Registrar, Melbourne
Uni.
What is the purpose of the large, black eye-
spots ( ocelli) on the fins of many small fishes,
especially coral fishes ? —9227.
According to A. R. McCulloch they afford
them protection by scaring away larger ene-
mies ; a foe in search of food observes what
seems to be, in the case of coral fishes, a large
eye peering steadily at it from among the coral
branches, and, suspecting danger in such an
unblinking gaze, makes off without further
investigation. It is notable that the young of
many different kinds have them well developed,
whereas they are usually lost as the fish grow.
How to compose a pantoum ? —9260.
It is made up of quatrains (as many as you
like) in which the second and fourth lines of
the first stanza become the first and third of
the next, and so on; the rhymes running
ab, a b; b c, b c ; c d, c d until the conclud-
ing stanza, the second and fourth lines of
which should be the first and third lines of the
opening stanza. The whole line, unaltered,
must in each case be repeated. Several examples
were given in the Red Page of The Bulle-
tin, December 31, 1914.
A Sydney newspaper, reporting a concert,
refers to the performance by a pianist of “one
of Schubert’s charming ‘Viennese Evenings’
arranged by Liszt-” I cannot find these in any
publisher’s list of Schubert’s works. (1) On
what did Liszt base his arrangement ? (2) When
did Schubert write the melodies ? (3) Did he
write any other waltzes ? (4) Are these obtain-
able-in Australia? —9247.
(1) On nine themes culled from Schubert’s
Op. 67, “Hommage aux belles Viennoises,”
which contains 16 waltz movements. Liszt’s
arrangement is named “Soirees de Vienne.” (2)
Can’t say. Op. 67 was published by Diabelli
in 1826; there is no clue as to the date on
which it was written. (3) Many others. Best-
known are those comprised in Op. 77 (Vaises
Nobles) and Op. 50 (Vaises Sentimentales). (4)
Very unlikely. Best plan is to place an order
in London or Leipzig. Novello (London) used
to publish a volume containing a very large
selection of Schubert’s dance music.
Should Handel’s oratorio be termed
“Messiah” or “The Messiah” ? —9253.
Jennens, author of the libretto, named it
“Messiah”; and Handel referred to it by that
title in correspondence. It appears as “Messiah”
on the first printed scores and on many editions
since. But the work, since its first performance
in 1742, has always been referred to by com-
mentators as “the ‘Messiah’ ” or “The Messiah.”
Groves give it both ways, but, save when quot-
ing Handel, never refers to it without the
“the,” a usage adopted by all other standard
authorities.
Titles and authors of new books banned by
the Irish Free State last year? —924l.
These are a few of them: “Thunder Below”
(T. Rourke), “The Puritan” (Liam O’Flaherty),
“Bernard Shaw” (Frank Harris), “Brave New
World” (Aldous Huxley), “Seed” (Charles G.
Norris), “Isobel” (Gerald Gould), “The Single
Heart” (Storm Jameson), “And No Bird Sang”
(P. Leader), “Safe Motherhood” (W. Arbuthnot
Lane) and “Work, Wealth and Happiness of
Mankind” (H. G. Wells).
(1) How to ascertain the polarity of a six-
volt accumulator ? (2) Meaning of A.H. capa-
city, as applied to accumulator cells ? —9280.
(1) Connect a short length of insulated wire
to each terminal; bare the ends and immerse
in a glassful of water to which about a tea-
spoonful of sulphuric acid has been added.
The two ends may be placed close together but
must not touch. The wire which liberates the
greater quantity of bubbles is connected to the
negative terminal. (2) The A.H. (ampere-hour)
capacity of an accumulator is obtained by mul-
tiplying its normal discharge current, in
amperes, by the total discharge period, in hours.
For example, a 40 A.H. cell will deliver a cur-
rent of 4 amperes for 10 hours.
(1) Is it possible to operate a 200 -watt house-
hold refrigerator from a wind-driven generator ?
(2) Where can I obtain further particulars ?
9228.
(1) Wind-driven generators are manufactured
to supply powers up to 3kw. for household
use. (2) L. D. Whyte, Box 433 F, G.P.0., Syd-
ney.
(1) Is it practicable to build dry cells that
will deliver a reasonable current ? (2) If so,
what materials will I peed ? (3) Details of con-
struction ? (4) Book on the subject ? —9224.
(1) Depends upon whether they are required
to supply intermittent current, as for bell or
telephone circuits, or continuous current, as for
wireless receivers. They can be made for the
former purposes, but home-made cells are not
successful for the latter. (2), (3) and (4) See
“Electrical'Primary Batteries,” by B. E. Jones,
2s. 3d., N.S.W. Bookstall Co.
Owing to lack of space I am unable to erect
an outdoor aerial. (1) Would, a frame aerial
be equally efficient ? (2) Is an earth necessary
in this case ? (3) Any alternative ? —9272.
(1) A frame aerial is less sensitive than an
outdoor aerial and must be oriented towards
the transmitting station, but it is more selective.
(2) No. (3) A small indoor aerial consisting
of about 30ft. of insulated wire run along
the picture-rail will be more satisfactory. An
earth will improve reception, but with a sensi-
tive set it may be dispensed with..
On what principle are boats used as ice-
breakers built ? —9275.
They are weighty and powerful, of excep-
tional strength, and capable of travelling at
sufficient speed to break the ice by their momen-
tum. They are constructed often with a sharp
keel that rises diagonally to the front of the
ship, thus enabling the ship to slide on to the
ice and break it down with its weight. Tanks
are fitted in the forepart to give the required
weight. The counter is strengthened so that
the ship can break ice when going astern, and
the rudder is protected against injury.
(1) Who was Hygeia and how is she usually
represented? (2) Where can, I find a picture
of her?—' 92B3.
(1) In Greek mythology, the goddess of health,
daughter of Tisculapius. She is represented
wearing a long robe, and having by her side a
snake which drinks from a cup in her hand.
(2) “Everyman’s Encyclopaedia,” Vol. VII, page
426.
(1) What proportion of air to petrol is used
in a motor-car engine ? (2) How is it adjusted ?
—9251.
(1) Approximately 16 parts of air to 1 of
petrol (by weight) if economy is sought, while
for maximum power about 15 to 1 is correct.
If the mixture is richer than about 14 to 1 or
weaker than 17 to 1 the gas will not ignite
properly. (2) By a valve in the carburetter.
Best type of window-box to use; also plants
suitable for same ? —9194.
Make the boxes of hardwood (double-
dressed) and paint them inside and out, fortify-
ing the corners with iron bands. Inside the
wooden trough should be a box of galvanised
sheet-iron, so made that it can be lifted out
when required for cleaning and replenishing
with fresh soil. In the drainage-hole, which
should be at the front of the box, solder a
small pipe to carry off the water. A hole
should be drilled for this in the wooden casing.
This saves discoloration of the wall. Ivy
geraniums (of various colors), lantana, piesem-
bryanthemums —all of trailing habits—wall-
flowers, candytuft, marigolds, pansies, ■ alyssum
(white, yellow and mauve), phlox drummondi
and many of the small-growing bulbs (lach-
enalia, hyacinths, snowdrops, etc.) are suitable.
Plants must be protected from excessive heat
and strong winds.
(1) Is it preferable to place aspidistras and
palms in small or large pots ? (2) How to kill
mealy bug on such plants? —92ll.
(1) By the use of small pots you restrict
the top growth and keep the palms more com-
pact. Aspidistras especially need small grow-
ing space and should only be repotted when the
roots have nearly filled the pot; kentia, cocos
and bangalow palms need a little top soil each
year to stimulate growth. (2) Remove all dead
growth from the pot-plants and then dab lightly
the little shield-like mealy bugs with a camel-
hair brush or feather dipped in methylated
spirit.
Do frosts occur all over Australia ? During
what periods does frost occur in the various
main divisions ? —9203.
Not in the northern coastal regions extending
from Geraldton, on the west coast, right round
the north and east coasts to Brisbane. On the
highlands in N. S. Wales, Victoria and Tas-
mania frosts have occurred in every month of
the year. Over most of the wheat areas of
South Australia, Victoria, N. S. Wales and
Queensland they have been recorded between
April and October; over north-central and
north-eastern Victoria and the south and central
western slopes of N. S. Wales, from April to
November; over the Gascoyne and north-eastern
parts of Westralia and Central Australia, and
in central and western Queensland from June
to August; over the southern portion of West-
ern Australia, from April to October.
When where and by whom was gold first
discovered in the Bathurst district, N.S.W.?—
91 On February 15, 1823, near the Fish River,
between Rydal and Bathurst, by James
Mcßrien, assistant-surveyor. This is the first
authenticated find in Australia.
Brief Answers.
J.C.: The word “policy,” meaning “purpose
of administration,” and that meaning “an in-
surance company’s promise to pay” are of
different origins, the first coming from the
Greek “politeia” and the other from a Greek
root meaning “to fold” R. 8.: Some 40 years
ago the native cat (Dasyurus viverrinus) was
extremely common in Victoria, but it was sud-
denly almost annihilated, probably by disease.
Now, however, it seems to be re-establishing
itself, and specimens have been seen even in
the neighborhood of .Melbourne. The tiger
cat ( D. maculatus ) is holding its own in the
Cape Otway district S.S.: Every male in
Vic. who receives sustenance is required, on
demand, to perform work of a prescribed class
for the municipality within whose district he
received sustenance. Failure without reasonable
excuse to perform in a satisfactory manner
any work so demanded may disentitle him to
further sustenance... .T.S.: “Rhodesia Agricul-
tural Journal,” Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia.

LLGHTREFRESHMENTS
A TALE OF ALIMENTARY SCIENCE
BY J.B.BLAIR
T ES,” said Captain Alfred Peabody
Y to his admiring band of listeners
in the back parlor of the Colonial
Lass, “us sailors have some remarkable
experiences, such as don’t always come
to them that stays at home. What with
storms and hurricanes and acts of God
and perils of the deep and bad victuals
and no grog”
Captain Peabody paused suggestively,
and gazed at his empty glass. A young
farmer, a stranger to the place, took the
hint, and the captain, affecting not to
notice the removal and reappearance of
his glass, continued :
“Yes, going without beer’s bad, and
bad victuals is worse, but no victuals at
all is the worst by far.”
Having delivered himself of this utter-
ance, he seemed suddenly to become
aware of the glass beside him, and, lest
it should disappear as mysteriously as
it had come, he raised it and dispatched
its contents.
The landlord, who had joined the
group, felt that it was up to him to say
something. “Yes,” he remarked, “starva-
tion’s a norful thing, specially if you die
of it. I wonst knew a bloke wot got
’imself lost up Mt. Bischoff way. When
they found ’im ’e’d et ’is boots and was
black in the face. A nice bloke, too, if
it ’adn’t been for the drink.”
He coughed confusedly, realising that
his last remark was not politic, and
forthwith endeavored to cover it up.
“Now, gents., what about one on the
’ouse while the skipper tells us one of
’is yarns?”
There were no refusals to the first
part of the proposition, but Captain Pea-
body protested that everyone had heard
all his yarns before. For once he seemed
earnest in his refusal to begin. Glasses
were refilled and conversation still
centred on the topic of starvation.
George Partridge had heard of a man
who lived on seagulls’ eggs for three
months. Harry Simmonds (who had read
a lot) told them of six men who lived in
“Is this the first time you’ve been out with a boy ?”
“Oh yes, since I’ve grown up. Of course, I’ve been out with gentlemen.”
an open boat for 22 days without any
food at all (except some rain water that
they caught in a sail, and some flying
fish that came aboard, but as they had
to be eaten raw they shouldn’t be counted
as much, Harry thought).
“Why didn’t they take some tucker in
the boat?” asked George Partridge.
“ ’Cos they were shipwrecked, o’
course,” replied Simmonds. “They didn’t
have no time to take any food.”
“But,” the other persisted, “the life-
boat orter bin fixed up with tucker. The
Board of Trade reg’lations says so.”
“I know those Board of Trade Regu-
lations,” broke in Captain Peabody. “I
know how they’re carried out, too.
Sodden biscuits and mouldy bread and
empty rum-bottles.”
“But Harry said there was nothin’ at
all.”
“Neither there was,” retorted Harry.
“I don’t know why there wasn’t, but
there wasn’t. If you’re not satisfied you’d
better ask the Board o’ Trade.”
The landlord intervened to pour oil on
the troubled waters. “Well, one thing,”
he said. “When we ’ave this tablet food
that those scientists talk about, that sort
of thing won’t ’appen. A bloke’ll just
’ave to grab a pocketful of tablets, and
’e’ll be set for a month.”
The company grinned assent, but Cap-
tain Peabody took him up quickly.
“Don’t talk to me about tablet food,”
he said. “I ought to know about it if
anyone does. All very well for these
scientists to talk. Just let them see how
it works out in practice.”
“Ever ’ad any experience, Captain?”
asked the landlord.
“Experience? Should say I have.
Experience! Well, 1 don’t think
I’ve told you before, but since
you’ve introduced the subject I’ll
tell you now.
“About twenty years ago,” said
Capain Peabody, “I took a party of
scientists down to the South Pole.
Not really to the South Pole, of
course, but thereabouts. The old
Lurline was the ship, schooner-
rigged and her bow specially fitted
to smash through the ice. The scientists
were Americans. Not a bad lot of chaps,
as Yanks go. They fell to doing all sorts
of jobs about the ship, to keep fit they
said, and to pass away the time.
“We set out from Hobart here in good
weather, and good weather we had all
the way down. Mind you, I’m not say-
ing there weren’t any squalls. One day
the port lifeboat was stove in and
smashed to bits, and a week later the
mizzen mast carried away; but taking
it on the whole we had good weather
right to the Bay of Whales. When we
got there the party landed and formed
what they called their base camp. As for
me and the Lurline—well, we were sup-
posed to come back to Hobart and return
to pick up the expedition, if anything
remained of it, next summer.
“But you never know what’s going to
happen in my job. Just the day before
we were to sail my first mate broke his
leg and I went down suddenly with
dengue fever.”
“Dengue fever!” interrupted Harry
Simmonds. “I always thought that was
a tropic disease?”
“I got it in the Bay of Whales,”
replied Captain Peabody icily, and con-
tinued his story.
“The scientist party, they insisted on
looking after us till we were quite re-
covered. Three weeks later, when I was
up and about again and the mate was
able to hobble on a crutch, the pack ice
completely shut us in, and there was
“Are your parents in the ocean to-day?”
“Don’t think so. But I heard mummie say this morning they’d soon be in the
soup.”
nothing for it but to stay there till it
melted.
“The scientific blokes were all right.
They were having the time of their young
lives, making observations, writing up
their diaries and taking toboggan rides
here, there and everywhere with dog
teams. But for us sailors it was rather
dull.
“I soon got tired of the novelty of
shooting the sun at midnight. It was
waste of time anyway, seeing that we
were stuck hard and fast in the one place,
and no prospect of moving for months.
“So you can guess that when Dr.
Huskiss, the leader of the expedition,
said to me one day, ‘Well, Captain, we’re
going to make a dash for the Pole;
would you like to come?’ I didn’t hesitate.
“The party was a small one. Dr.
Huskiss had, as his second-in-command,
a Mr. Jackson. Then there was a geolo-
gist, a botanist, a photographer, a news-
paperman from a New York paper, a
pack of dogs, two sledges and myself.
When all was ready to start, the dogs
all harnessed up and the tents and gear
packed on the sledges, I mentioned to
the doctor that there didn’t seem to be
room for us all.
“ ‘Room! ’ he said ; ‘you don’t think
we’re going to ride, do you? We’re
going to walk.’ And me just recovered
from a fever, mind you! Still, anything
was better than staying on board the
ship, so I said no more.
“We set out after breakfast, and by
midday you can bet I was feeling pretty
hungry. The doctor called a halt. Then
he went and rummaged in one of the
sledges and produced a small box. ‘I
have decided,’ says he, ‘to give each
man his rations for the entire trip. You
can each therefore have your meals
when and where you like without bother
or inconvenience.’ Then he handed us
each a small packet containing a few
dozen tablets, looking like white pepper-
mints.
“I said ‘What are these, Doc. —digestion
tablets?’ ‘No,’ he replied; ‘they’re your
rations for the trip to the Pole and back! ’
“ ‘Well, you can give them to the ice-
man,’ says I. ‘l’ll just have a pemmican
pie and a quart of hot cocoa to go on
with.’
“Then he explained that he was quite
serious, and that these were the latest
scientific foods. Complete meals in
highly concentrated form, containing all
the necessary vittymins—whatever they
may be. He showed me that they were
all branded with their contents, and said
he was going to have an Irish stew right
then. He swallowed a tablet and licked
his lips.
“I looked over my stock and selected
pea-soup, steak and onions and apple-
tart. After swallowing them in the pro-
per order I really felt as though I’d had
a satisfying meal.
“When I saw the botanist and the
photographer handing the dogs a tablet
apiece I began to think that science was
of some value after all.
“Everything went along all right for
a few days. Believe me or not, those
tablets were the real thing. Just
swallow ’em down like pills and the
hunger feeling disappeared right away.
But on the fifth day the trouble started.
“Mind you, at first we didn’t know
there was any trouble. Leastways, no
one except Mr. Jackson. The rest of us
found it out gradually, and by compar-
ing notes we got the whole story.
“Well, on the fifth day, Dr. Huskiss
comes up to Mr. Jackson and says care-
lessly, ‘Say, old man, I’ve mislaid my
rations. What about a soup and veg.
to go on with? I’ll pay you back to-
morrow. They’re sure to turn up some-
where.’
“Jackson says nothing, but slips him
a tablet.
“At tea-time the doc. comes to him
again and says the darn things are still
missing, and could he spare a pork and
beans?
“The second happens to be pretty fond
of pork and beans and doesn’t see why
he should part with his share, so he says
he’s sorry but he’d swallowed his last
pork and beans five minutes before, but
he had a spare rhubarb-tart. After a
bit of haggling they compromised on a
veal and ham pie, but the atmosphere
was rather strained.
“The chief passed him over next
morning, and managed to get a porridge
from the botanist and an egg and bacon
from the geologist. At lunch-time the
photographer parted with a roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding. Dinner-time the
pressman was tackled. Two frankfurts
and a Cornish pasty.
“Next day it was my turn. I was just
making up my mind what to have for
breakfast when the chief came up to me
and said, ‘Well, Skipper, what do you
think of the tablets?’
“ ‘First rate, Doctor,’ says I. ‘No time
wasted fooling around cooking meals,
no dishes to wash and no indigestion
afterwards.’
“ ‘Yes,’ says he, ‘they’re certainly con-
venient, but they have their drawbacks.
For instance, I’ve unaccountably mislaid
mine. Can’t think where they can be.
I was just wondering whether you could
spare me a couple of chops till I find
’em again. Of course, I’ll pay you back.’
“ ‘That’s all right, Doctor,’ I replied.
‘Only too pleased to help you out.’
“That was the first time, but after the
novelty wore off I began to get a bit
sick of it, and used to dodge him when-
ever we halted. Soon I noticed that every-
one else was doing the same. It was
funny to see the boss trying to catch
one of us alone, and the rest of the party
playing twos and threes around the tents.
“The expedition was seething with
mutiny. It isn’t too easy to look up to
a leader who is waiting his opportunity
to cadge a meal off you as soon as he
catches you unawares.
“Lord knows how the thing would
have finished if it hadn’t been for an
accident on the fourteenth day, when me
and the second fell into a crevasse. They
dragged us out with ropes, and there
was no bones broke, but when we halted
that night I suddenly found that the
small bag containing my rations had

gone. The second then found that he’d

“Our rations were down that crevasse,
miles back, and likely as not frozen over
by now. No hope at all of seeing em
again. We were in the same box as the
doctor, and would have to depend on
the charity of the others for our lives.
“We managed it for a day or so,
though you’ve no idea what a job it
was. The botanist was the easiest mark,
and I never managed him in less than
five minutes.

there must be a fresh distribution. But
the doctor went one better. ‘Look here,’
he said, ‘we three are more than a match
for the rest of them. You stick to me
and I’ll fix things all right.’
“He called a conference, and told the
others he wasn’t going to have any
monkey business. He was leader, and
he was going to lead. Rations was short,
and the only thing to do was to share
and share alike for the common good.
He was going to take charge of all the
tablets and issue them out each day.
Half-rations was to be the rule, and they
would turn back right away and make
for the base camp.
“He certainly put it across them. The
geologist muttered something about care-
less prodigality, and the chief asked him
what he meant by that, and he said ‘No-
thing!” Then they all handed over their
packets. The kodak-snapper’s lot seemed
pretty light, and I said so. Then the
other three turned on him. He fished up
the rest of his tablets from his pocket,
and said he hoped there was some hypo,
among ’em and someone he wouldn’t
name would get it.
“We started off back next day, and
we were a gloomy crowd. Half-rations
aren’t good at the be-t of times, but the
old man’s method ol dishing them out
didn’t improve things. He seemed to
reckon a tablet was a tablet, what-
ever it was labelled. If you were lucky
you got roast duck and green peas. If
you weren’t you might have to put
up with a rhubarb-tart, which is pro-
bably just as healthy, but not nearly so
sustaining.
“You’d have thought we’d had our
share of bad luck, but there was worse
to come. The sixth day after turning
back we had halted for the night and
were all busy fixing up one of the tents
when we heard a funny sound. We
looked round just in time to see one of
the dogs move away from the sledge
where he’d been nosing about. He
moved about two steps, uttered the
sound again and lay down quiet and
still.
“I can’t describe the sound he made.
It wasn’t a bark or a moan or anything
like that, but just the sort of sound you’d
expect a dog to make what has gone
his whole life with one great wish in his
heart and all of a sudden the wish has
been granted. And no wonder! He’d
eaten seven men’s rations all in one
gulp! All that stood between them and
starvation.
“We went over to him. He was quite
dead, and he looked happy. And I
should think he would. The botanist
worked out afterwards that that dog’s
corpse contained the equivalent of two
whole bullocks, 20 head of sheep, a pig
and a half, a dozen poultry, six dozen
eggs, 16 buckets of assorted soups, half
a hundredweight of flour, six bags of
potatoes and enough fruit, veges., fur-
bishings and fittings to keep a family of
five off the dole for a week. If that dog
hadn’t looked happy he’d have been the
most ungrateful animal that ever drew
breath.
“Well, it was no use cursing over what
couldn’t be cured. We had one of the
dog’s tablets apiece for tea, and dis-
cussed the future. The dog tablets were
of two kinds —raw steak and dog biscuit.
Not very tasty, but quite satisfying. I’d
sneaked one or two before when I lost
my rations, and I rather suspect the
doctor and the second had done the
same.
“The doctor checked over the stocks
and reckoned that, if we killed and ate
one dog every third day, then that dog’s
share of the tablets would keep us
going for the next two days. With care
we should just reach the base camp the
day after we killed the last dog.
“So we might have done, but a bliz-
zard held us up and put us off our track
and lost us several days. We killed our
last dog, and were still miles from the
base. Pulling the sledges ourselves was
no fun.
“Three days passed, and the last dog-
biscuit tablet was gone. We were look-
ing hungrily at each other, although
none of us looked very appetising. Then
when we’d almost given up hope our
luck turned. We stumbled across a
cache of tinned meat that a previous
party had left behind.
“Thank God I’d stuck to my tin-
opener through thick and thin. There
were stacks of the tinned stuff there, and
we had a good old tuck-in. Tablet
food’s all right, as far as it goes, but if
you want something you can really rely
on give me a good old tin of corned beef.
“We got back to the base a few days
later, and I never tried any more sledg-
ing expeditions.”
The company in the back parlor were
silent for a moment, then George Part-
ridge called for drinks all round.
“Captain Peabody’s health,” he pro-
claimed, and all drank gravely.
“My word,” said the landlord, “that
must ’a’ been a terrible experience. I’ll
bet the doctor and his lot ’ad ’ad enough
of tablet food.”
“Not a bit of it,” replied the captain,
“not a bit of it! I didn’t intend to cast
a gloom on the company by telling you
the sad sequel, but, now you’ve men-
tioned it, perhaps I should round off the
yarn.
“Next summer off we all sailed again
in the Lurline, and reached the same old
spot in the Bay of Whales where the
expedition went ashore. This time the
mate didn’t break his leg and”—-looking
fiercely at Harry Simmonds —“I didn’t get
dengue fever, and we sailed away before
the ice closed in.
“Are you sure you will be happy
when you are married ?”
“Of course, I will. Jim simply
adores me, and so do I.”
“Eight months later we returned to
pick them up. As we entered the bay
we saw the huts but no sign of life
around them. We went ashore, and there
were the poor chaps, all dead in the huts.
We couldn’t make it out.
“ ‘They couldn’t have starved,’ said
the mate. ‘There are plenty of tablets
left.’
“Sure enough, all around the hut were
boxes and boxes of tablets, all opened
and mostly full. Some were upset on
the floor. It was uncanny.
“Not thinking, I put one of the
tablets in my mouth. The taste was
familiar. Unpleasant taste. Just like
kalsomine. Then I realised what it was.
Phenacetin.
“The poor fellows had taken the wrong
tablets.”
The Clanging Phrases.
Ah, I am sick of the clash and the ringing of
words,
The arrowy malice, the short, sharp daggers
of spite,
The yellow and violet bruises from staves of
emotion,
The patient campfires of hate that flicker at
night.
When the sun goes down there is truce from
the clanging phrases,
And silence, paler than snowflakes, drifts in
the air.
Oh, my love, my love, come out in the truce
of twilight
And pass your quiet fingers through my hair.

Roast PorK,
BY CHRISTINE COMBER.
JACQUES FOURMIS stood in the
middle of his cabin and counted his
packages. One, two, three, four,
five And the trunk in the hold. He
rubbed his hands together, sighed, rubbed
his hands together again, then thrust
them into his pockets and peered out of
his porthole to catch another glimpse of
Sydney as the boat swung round.
Then with puckered brow and pursed-
up lips he plumped his bed, counted the
blankets, sat on the bed and bounced up
and down on it, a critical right eyebrow
wagging up and down all the time. As
suddenly he began to unpack his valise,
setting out his evening clothes on the
spare bed.
Jacques Fourmis was a wine merchant,
a Frenchman and a Jew; and proud of
it all. Had not his father, too, been all
three, and his grandfather before him?
But neither of them had been in as big
a way as Jacques. A glow of conscious
pride warmed him as he thought of his
two sons at the university, and his daugh-
ter, married to a good, steady Jew in
the textile trade. His thoughts flashed
again to his elder son, and his brow fur-
rowed.
He hoped his elder son would not
marry a Christian. Though really that
little Claridge girl was pretty enough for
any man to make a fool of himself over.
And, strictly speaking, although he ob-
served all the feasts and fast days, and
was a regular attendant at the synagogue,
he did not venerate the Rabbi as he
knew he ought. Could he even call him-
self a true believer? Yet he had a
fierce racial pride that made him rejoice
in every achievement of another Jew the
world over.
Jacques dressed for dinner carefully,
for he was proud of his appearance. He
felt that he owed it to France and the
Jewish race. Always it was his aim that
none should be able to raise the eye-
brow or point the finger at him and say
“A Jew, my deah, surely.” For some
of his brethren, he thought, savored too
obviously of the pawnshop.
Jacques sauntered into the dining-
room, short, dark and just a thought too
carefully groomed. He took his seat
and studied the menu. A thrill of desire
rose from his stomach and found expres-
sion in a watering of his mouth.
A moment he hesitated, glancing ner-
vously at the steward. Then he gave
an order that put him in complete sym-
pathy with Adam and Eve over that
little matter of the forbidden apple.
Jacques’s carefully-suppressed weak-
ness was for roast pork.
While he waited for his order he per-
used the menu further, and savored in
anticipation his roast pork and crack-
ling. He wondered if the great teachers
of old knew what a delicious dish they
were denying themselves. Christians ate
of the forbidden animal lavishly, and
seemed to thrive on it. Rabbit, too.
But Jacques had not liked his one sample
of rabbit. Nor ham, specially, nor bacon
to any extraordinary degree. But roast
pork!....
Roast pork was a food fit for emperors.
And there were three whole days between
Sydney and Wellington for him to
enjoy it.
He raised his eyes from the menu and
gianced round at his neighbors. Curious
thought that they were all assembled in
state to refuel their bodies, like cars at
a service station. More curious still how
man, of all the animals, ate slowly and
ceremoniously, waiting for food to be
put before him, and leaving little pieces
of this and that on his plate to show his
breeding—like a dog trained to leave
the last mouthful of stew, or a hen the
last half-dozen grains. But he, Jacques
Fourmis, would leave no morsel of his
roast pork. That he would relish to the
last mouthful. He would
Then it was that his brain sputtered
and almost stopped functioning.
Smiling at him from the next table
were a lady and a gentleman, fellow-
Jews from his own synagogue, his own
street! And Jacques’s roast pork would
any moment be on the way, would any
moment be deposited in all its savory
succulence in front of him under the
eyes of Mr. and Mrs. Proust.
His first gust of anger and resentment
gave place to fear and shame. He,
Jacques Fourmis, the strictest observer of
every Jewish custom, the most regular
attendant at services and ceremonies, the
upholder of the faith of his fathers, par-
taking of Christian abominations the
moment he was off the chain! Fear
overwhelmed him and cleared his brain.
A steward approached in answer to a
deftly-raised eyebrow. A coin changed
hands.
Three minutes later Jacques Fourmis
was regarding gratefully, if with regret,
a large portion of roast lamb. All the
while he grieved for his lost roast pork.
Suddenly across the smooth surface of
his consciousness glided the luscious
smell of pork. Close behind him it
passed, and took material shape in front
of Mr. and Mrs. Proust. Jacques pinched
himself hard, then stared in wonder at
his neighbors.
Rage was in his heart for his unneces-
sary sacrifice. Rage and hatred of the
man and woman who had so uncon-
sciously spoilt his dinner. Balefully he
glared at them as they vigorously
attacked the pork that should have been
his.
Casually glancing round her, Mrs.
Proust happened to catch his scowl
directed at her plate. Checking a frag-
ment of crackling midway on its course
to her mouth, she blushed deeply and
murmured a word to her husband. A
moment later Jacques saw them eating
their meal half-heartedly, shamefaced and
uneasy, and he smiled to think that at
least they were getting no more pleasure
from their order than he had from his.
He turned with every appearance of
conscious virtue to the consumption of
his lamb and mint sauce. A new thought
struck him, and he raised his table nap-
kin to his lips to hide the smile of tri-
umph that had contracted his features.
And now, maybe the fellow would go
on getting his wine supplies through that
little fat German, Cohen! Yes, and
maybe he wouldn’t!
Jacques Fourmis smiled again, openly
this time, for Mr. Proust’s especial bene-
fit. Most certainly it paid to be a good
Jew!
God in the Jungle.
I watched my son go striding through t?ie trees,
Seeing, then missing him, to see again
Through citradora branches that the breeze
Made fragrant, and a silver haze of rain.
I watched him mount the hill and disappear
Over the crest; and all the world was drear.
Oh, mother-heart that frets, oh, eyes that weep!
Oh, lonely days and sleepless nights when
black
Fear shows no mercy; when pale phantoms
creep,
Whisp’ring of danger in the loved one’s track,
Wakening chill presentiments of harm,
Painting grim pictures, sounding high alarm!
But like as not the skies beyond are fair,
And forest aisles are flower-filled, green, and
cool
With wattle-scented winds. It may be there
Tall gums are grouped about some secret pool
Where lilies bloom. There’s lotus in the reeds;
Blue butterflies flit by the water-weeds.
Why fear the jungle? ’Tis no place possessed
Of devils bent on mischief. Well I know
It friend, quick to protect and love, and blessed
In dim green leafy ways where waters flow.
God’s there. In scrub and forest, rain and
shine;
And all’s divine.

THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
CLASSING ONCE MORE.
“S.V.”: “Murrawong” (B. 22/11/’33)
is entitled to his own ideas on classing,
but no sheepowner who knows his job
would do what he suggests. How could a
man mistake a shafty, bold 64 for a 70,
whether from the same animal under dif-
ferent conditions or not? If he can’t
recognise them, then he hasn’t a hope
of classing his clip ; but the suggestion
as applied to what I wrote in B. 15/11 /’33
is ludicrous in the extreme.
Re “Murrawong’s” remarks on what
I said about yields. I don’t expect the
owner to understand yield perfectly ; 1 do
say that, with the aid of commonsense,
he can class his own clip well enough for
market, provided he has the training.
Is it commonsense to put a “showy
white fleece as heavy as an old ram’s”
amongst his top lines just because it is
white? It is full of grease and, therefore,
of lower yield than other bright, free
wools. When it comes to estimating the
correct percentage yield of a wool, the
sheepowner would fail; but, as I also
stated, this is an art, and only thoroughly
understood by competent appraisers and
buyers, many an ordinary classer having
much to learn on the subject.
OVERCOMING STERILITY.
“Cincinn”: Breeding farm stock over
a number of years, I have found the fol-
lowing methods helpful:
(1) Get the prospective breeder into as good
a condition of health as possible. In the case
of milking stock out of condition through
mineral deficiency, first make good the defi-
ciency by supplying salt, bonemeal, lime, etc., by
means of a suitable lick or foods containing
t e (2) n Whh7owsfhmewater and cod-liver oil at
weaning and previous to weaning promote con-
ception.
(3) Give potassium iodide by “peaceful pene-
tration” methods, he., give one crystal per day
finely crushed and mixed with pollard. Start
as early as possible prior to breeding. Todine
and cod-liver oil promote the assimilation of
lime into the system.
(4) Lime for all breeding stock, from the hen
*(5) An ounce or two of bicarbonate of potash
in the drinking water or food for a week pre-
vious to service neutralises acidity of the mucus
in the canals.
THE CHAIN SYSTEM.
“Lion”: “A.J.8.” (B. 29/11/’33) con-
demns the chain system of killing for
N.S.W. because, he says, it isn’t as fast
or as good as the “solo” method.
The Argentine uses this system only,
and finds it very successful; and every-
one knows that no country can export
a better-dressed carcass than the Argen-
tine does
The paramount advantage of the sys-
tern is the ease with which amateurs can
become proficient. It means that the dis-
location to the export trade from strikes
is greatly minimised, which is highly
desirable. Surely we have had enough
of these troubles to last us all a lifetime.
Butchering well and quickly done is
worth watching at all times ; but there is
nothing to prevent the tradesman from
becoming even more expert under the
chain system than previously.
SHEEP IN THE N.T.
“James Rankin”: A lot of fuss is being
made about the Barkly Tableland as
sheep country. According to the press
it is the land of promise, but the would-
be pioneer or speculator should tackle
the proposition warily. One enthusiast
claims that Avon Downs (N.T.) sheep
were introduced m 1913, but there is
another side to the woolly history of the
tableland
There were sheep on Avon long before
1913. Once it had 70,000 sheep and
14,000 cattle. Senator Guthrie has told
the story. The cattle were carrying the
sheep even in those far-off days before
the Queensland meatworks market was
available. Barkly Tableland is no place
for the small man. The history of Avon
Downs, which was owned by a well-
backed company, goes to prove that. If
sheep had been as profitable as we hear,
would the owners have gone back to
cattle, sacrificing hundreds of miles ot
costly fencing, shearing and other
machinery and improvements?
Barkly Tableland is good cattle coun-
try, but as sheep country it lacks natural
water and accessibility. Sub-artesian
water can be struck at about 300 ft., but
it varies in quality, and sheep will not do
well on it after the Mitchell grass begins
to dry off. With a railway across the
tableland, markets would be brought
closer, but a line would not be justified,
As things stand, all stores, fencing wire
and bore casing have to be brought 600
miles at least from the Cloncurry rail-
head, or 300 or 400 miles from Birdum
on the Darwin side,
Shearing costs are high. Wool has to
be carried by road back to Burketown
or one of the railheads and shipped to
market. By the time wethers have been
travelled several hundred miles nearer
market there would be little margin be-
tween the droving fees and their value as
s t D re sheep. If it costs 12d. per lb. to grow
i nnoondand nmnerties handv
on Queensland properties nanay
to rail, it will cost at least 18d. per lb.
in the N.T. under prevailing conditions,
jf J were j n a position to invest in sheep-
breeding I would seek some good safe
sheep-to-the-acre country in N.S.W.
THE ZONE SYSTEM,
“Trepex” : “Sheepo” (B. 29/ 11 /’33)
~ , £ , , L . T f '
mistakes me if he thinks that I intended
(B. 8/11/ 33) to get back to ottering
wool in order of its arrival into store.
Experience tells us that that method of
offering did produce the sameness of
wool m the catalogues of which Sheepo
complains. The zone system was intro-
duced in 1928 to bring forward the sup-
P.bf in quicker rotation than was pos-
Slble under the flat order-of-arnval sys-
, . ...... . ~ ~
Within its limited intention, the zon
astern has , worked well, and few, if any
tbe sellers, brokers or buyers would
se ®. d . scrapped unless for something
wbicb improved on it. Buyers are look-
ln§ bigger supplies of late-shorn
wool t^lan are B iven to them in the cata-
logues and going to the country dealers
[ or sucb V oo ' sh° ws that the zone system
has not given them all they want, and of
course it is notorious how the growers
of late-shorn wool all the time press for
earlier sale of their clips,
, I lo °k for a process which will separate
tbe earlier-shorn wools from the western
slopes and plains from the later-shorn
s from the tablelands, the latter
being the freer and more stylish in
condition.
I contend that by dividing the season
into “time” zones—three, four, or even
five of them—with a proportionate offer-
ing of each according to quantity in
store, a greater and earlier variation of
style would appear in the catalogues,
which would greatly help the buyers and,
what is even more urgent, provide a
greater equity of offering.
FEEDING LAMBS FOR MARKET,
, , „ T . • ~ , , , ,
Jumbuck : It is essential to fat-lamb
production that ewes should have an in-
creasing supply of milk to promote
growth. The pastures should be rich in
protein so that the milk will contain a
sufficient percentage to bring about good
flesh formation in the lambs. Lambs
receiving an early check do not reach
maturity at the desired time. When
topped-up at four or five months, their
lamb-quality is missing.
In pastures lacking protein lucerne
chaff or hay, if given as a ration, will
make up the deficiency.
In grain-growing areas where fat-
lamb production is a sideline, give the
ewes a ration of linseed meal or cake.
Maize and oats are low in milk-produc-
ing foods. Where the ewes graze on
heavy green lucerne, rape or clover pas-
tures, provide a lick of three parts salt
to one of lime. This will act as a bloat
preventive.
Where merino ewes are used for mating
with any of the English breeds, consider
only big, plain-bodied types as mothers.
Small-framed ewes mean lambing losses,
and the lambs produced are only weeds.
When lambs mature get them off, or
meat quality will be impaired. Some
growers wait until their lambs reach an
age that will allow them to dress around
361 b. to 381 b.; these weights are too
heavy for the trade. From 281 b. to
321 b. is right, either for home or export.
THE FUNCTION OF FALLOW.
“Yeoman”: Farmers should not mis-
interpret the results (“Kilkivan,” B.
22/11 / ’33) of Professor Richardson’s
demonstration of some new fallowing
and artificial manuring factors.
It is quite trub that the Professor has
established at the Waite Institute, Adel-
aide, that over a period of years the yield
from wheat following a pea crop, or
grown on stubble land dressed with nitro.
plus super, fertilisers, is just as heavy as
that grown on well-worked fallow with
super, only. These tests show that under
certain conditions fallow is not needed, so
that the loss of a season’s grazing can be
saved, besides the cost of the extra work-
ings of the land involved in early-winter
fallow. The savings would be more
than the cost of the amm. sulph. needed
to make up for the loss of nitrogen in
substituting the cropping of stubble for
fallow.
At the Waite Institute the rainfall is
about 23in. per year—it falls mainly dur-
ing the growing period. Thus, moisture
is not the limiting factor, and fallow, the
chief purpose of which is to conserve
moisture, is not necessary. But this does
not apply to most wheat land, where the
average rainfall varies from lOin. to 16in.
With this rainfall it would be suicidal to
attempt to grow wheat without fallow.
Though a big part of the Australian
wheat crop is grown on stubble land, the
difference between the yield from crops
grown on fallow and on stubble is so
marked as to demonstrate the import-
ance of well-worked fallow.
Under normal conditions, early-winter
fallow, with later workings to hold the
surface tilth and arrest capillary move-
ment of moisture to the surface, will con-
serve most of the rain falling during that
period and keep it to support the fall
during the next year’s actual growing
period. This extra moisture makes all
the difference between a good and a poor
crop. At the same time such fallow pro-
motes intensive activity of the nitrify-
ing bacteria, with the result that the
equivalent of 4cwt. to scwt. of nitro.
.fertilisers is built up in the soil as a
reserve.
But where the rainfall is over 20in.
doing without fallow can be considered.
At the same time, an alternative to crop-
ping stubble which cannot be overlooked
is to plough up green or stubble land
early in the winter, work it down nicely,
and then sow field peas. These should
return £5 per acre either by harvesting
the seed for sale or for fattening lambs.
The peas act as a soil renovator; also
build up a nitrogen reserve from the
atmosphere. The following season this
land can be cropped with wheat when
super, only would be required. The
yield will be equal to that of a crop
grown on fallow.
BETTER STOCK—BETTER
FARMERS.
“Observer”: The cow-cocky still com-
plains, “I’m sick of these fellows who
say they want a job and then won’t put
any ginger into it when you give ’em
one.” True, many on the track would
rather stay on it, but a big percentage
would work conscientiously if the work
were sufficiently interesting. You can’t
blame a man failing to show any en-
thusiasm among nondescripts which mas-
querade as dairy cattle. There’s no in-
ducement to learn anything about breed-
ing or feeding.
For sheer heartbreaking toil, the sheep
game beats the cow game, yet men come
thousands of miles to learn about our
methods of jumbuck-breeding and -rais-
ing. With our natural advantages, the
same thing should apply to both our
beef-cattle and dairying industries. The
time is ripe for stringent laws relating to
the “breeding” of dairy herds from scrub
bulls. The cocky who can’t see that the
function of the bull is to improve the
quality of the following generation is
better out of the industry.
NOT THE GROWERS’ FAULT.
“Fodgie”: The trouble with auditors
is that they deal only in figures, and
figures do not tell the whole story. The
South Aus. Auditor-General, referring to
financial results in the drier districts, con-
veys the impression of ineptitude on the
part of the farmers (B. 22/11 /’33). The
truth is that luck has been all against
them.
The bumper season 1930-31 saw a dis-
astrous fall in prices; many of the
cockies would have been home-and-dried
had they got the 4s. promised by the
politicians. Followed a mouse plague,
which resulted in a big percentage of
the seed being ruined, both before and
after sowing. Then came red rust; then
a rabbit plague. To add to our troubles,
the State Bank officials cut every appli-
cation for super, by a ton or more, and
did not manage to get the super, there
in time for the earliest crops. No wonder
the average yield was small! It’s all
very fine to blame the farmer and prove
the case by columns of figures. But let
us look for causes.
WHEAT-POISONING.
“T.P.C.”: From considerable experi-
ence I can endorse “WJ.’s” testimony
(B. 8/11 /’33) as to the efficacy of a dose
of |lb. bicarb, soda for a wheat-gorged
horse. Drive the affected animal at once
into water and allow it to drink freely.
If bloodshot specks in the eye suggest
inflammation, give a few drops of lauda-
num. Should recovery be slow, stand

SHINGLING HINTS.
“Booraby”: Split shingles are stronger
for roofing and more reliable than sawn
shingles. Have them 16in. long and not
more than wide. If too wide they
may warp and split. All must be exactly
the same width. The shingles, in each
course, must fit centrally over the joints
of those in the preceding course. Every
second row is begun with a half width,
just as every second row of a brick wall
is begun with a half-brick. Start at the
bottom with half-length pieces. The next
course —16in.—goes on top and flush at
the eaves to cover the joints. Later rows
overlap all but 4iin. of the lower course.
Builders commonly fasten the shingles
with two nails, but I think one enough
until the top is reached. The best timbers
are ironbark, grey gum, box stringybark
and blackbutt.

KUDZU VINE.
“Dejay”: Where soil erosion is bad
or hills are washing out and scouring
badly, a few packets of kudzu vine seed
are a good investment. It is a perennial
legume and runs over the ground
quickly, rooting at every joint and mat-
ting loose soil well. The foliage and
runners as they die off help to bind the
soil and enrich it, when other grasses
can be introduced and thrive, winning
back the waste area in a few years. Kudzu
thrives on the poorest of soils and, once
established, is permanent.
CHILLED BEEF.
“Beefo”: The small grazier who has
pastures suitable for topping-up will get
the full benefit of the dulling process
when it is established. Early-maturing
cattle breeds will have to be cultivated.
Chilling of carcasses must wipe out the
big demand for frozen beef ; only light-
weight carcasses, showing bloom and
quality, will be wanted at Smithfield.
Meatworks must reorganise. Co-opera-
tion is badly needed.
If Australia is to compete favorably
with other beef-producing countries, a
railway must be built in the North. Young
steers must reach topping-up pastures
without long road travelling.
Big breeders outback will be satisfied
to get rid of their surplus every year. If
fresh blood of earlier-m'aturing breeds
is introduced into the Shorthorn herds,
and there' are proper facilities for
getting the young cattle . into, the more
central topping-up pastures, there’s noth-
ing to prevent Australia from becoming
a power in the chilied-beef trade.
■ The Zebu- blootl Tnight K succeed —and
might not—but the, Aberdeen-Angus and
Devon breeds have already proved them-
selves.
STRANGLES.
“The Breaker”: Horses at any age
may be affected with strangles. A dis-
charge from the nostrils, difficulty in
swallowing and a dull appearance and'
projected head are enough to show a
horse has an abscess or two forming at
the back of the jaws. Broken-in horses
can be poulticed quite easily if a suitable
headstall or halter is used. Lance the
abscess if it delays long in breaking itself.
Give bran and linseed mashes, with three
drachms of hyposulphite of soda daily in
the feed. While discharging, clean and
wash the wound with an antiseptic lotion.
Isolate all strangle cases, as they are
infectious.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Wrash”: When the wheat is ripening
and a grass fire springs up suddenly there
usually is a rush for gum boughs. Time
is wasted, too, later, in renewing them
when the leaves have been burnt or
beaten off. Permanent, specially-made
beaters are better. To handy-sized sap-
lings bind broad, ‘oblong bands of green-
hide, and keep the implements standing
ready in a cask of water. Soaked hide
is not harmed by fire, and one flap from
such a beater will quench almost any
grass blaze.
“Eureka”: Don’t feed a cattle- or
sheepdog on wallaby flesh. It will , give
him worms, and he will always be poor
and wretched-looking.
“B. Sting”: To get the purest and
whitest beeswax, melt out by sun heat.
Place the combs facing the sun on slanted
sheets of corrugated iron, with dishes
below to catch the melting wax. - All resi-
due will stick to the iron.
“Colon”: Watch the trees when in-
specting new sheep country. All box
country is good, but white box needs a
better rainfall than the grey. Yellow
box means a sandy loam, therefore a
quick growth of feed after rain. Boree,
belar and yarran mean quick-fattening
but light-carrying country. Ironbark sug-
gests sweet country. Peppermint needs
plenty of rain, but is usually found on
poor soil. Pine, in conjunction with grey
box, is fair. Avoid bull-oak, as the grass
will dry up after the first few hot days.
“Carben”: To prevent weevils getting
into skins, take l|lb. of arsenic, ilb. of
common soap cut into thin slices, lib. of
washing-soda. Place in a sgal. drum
half-full of water. Boil for two hours,
stirring often. Then fill up the drum
with cold water and stir again. Paint
the mixture on to the fleshy side of the
skins with a wide, flat brush.
“Cockyson”: A fruit-tree which has
arrived at the bearing stage can be
moved to a different site if it is dormant
and showing no sign of making new leaf.
Cut the roots through at a distance of
two or three feet from the stem, accord-
ing to the size and spread, of the tree,
some months previously. Then dig the
ground away from the roots and pack
fresh surface soil containing plenty of
humus in order to encourage a new
growth of roots. The filament-like ter-
minals of the roots act as feeders. It is
desirable that a good growth of these
should be present when the tree is re-
moved. Choose a wet day for the job.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
{Transferred from Service Department.)
Best method of (1) determining the sex of
hen eggs and (2) the fertility or infertility of
same ? —8971.
As far as we know there is no method of
determining the sex of hen eggs prior to hatch-
ing, and the only method oi knowing whether
eggs are fertile or not is by incubation. On
mating birds with strong vitality the average
estimate of fertility is approximately 75 per
cent, of the eggs‘laid after the birds have been
mated for ten days.
How to eradicate sweet briar ? —9148.
Sweet briar being a perennial plant, as much
of the root stock as is practicable should be
grubbed. If the plant is only burned or cut
down, the root system, in its struggle to survive,
will throw up many suckers, and the stronger
the soil the more vigorous the growth. Even
if the greater part of the root system is ex-
tracted fresh growths are likely to appear from
portions left in the soil, but if the frequent
grubbing continues the root system will die.
Seedlings may, however, appear from seeds
which have fallen in the past.
Prospects of profit from breeding mules for
farm work in N. S. Wales ?— 9190.
It would not pay to breed mules in Australia.
Mules are good workers, cheap to keep, and
are, of special value in orchard work, but the
Australian farmer does not take readily to them.
A few years ago the N.S.W. Agric. Dept, im-
ported'some Jacks from America for propaga-
tion. After distribution of a fair number, the
venture was abandoned from lack of support. It
is doubtful if better success would attend a
fresh "attempt, v .j .
(ly What Act' covers the distribution of milk
•and cream-for consumption or ruse in the Sydney
metropolitan milk-distributing district ? (2) How
can a dairyman become registered under the
'Act? ' (3) Where, can a copy of the Act be
obtained? —9184.
(1) The Milk Act. (2) Get in touch with the
Milk Board, Chancery Square, Sydney, which
will send application form on request. Each
application is : . considered on its merits, but the
board is.opposed generally to the registering of
additional dairies associated with the city supply.

What has been the cost of producing
Queensland sugar, and what has it been sold
for during the last four years? How is the
amount of subsidy»determined ? Does it vary ?
Has Queensland a 44-hour week ? —9176.
The production cost varies from farm to
farm, and from season to season; a fair esti-
mate would place the figure at from £lB-£22
per ton, raw sugar. The average price declared
for the past five years is:
1928 .. .. £2O 17 11
1929 .. .. 20 5 10
1930 .. .. 19 13 1
1931 .. 18 6 6
1932 .. 19 6 1
The industry is protected by an embargo against
import of foreign sugar, and the price is fixed
by agreement between the Federal and State
Governments, generally at three-year intervals.
The present raw-sugar home-consumption price
is £24 per ton; surplus. sugar is marketed in
England, chiefly, and the average value received
for all sugars is pooled. The present agree-
ment expires with the 1935 crop. Under the
1933 award, sugar-workers were granted a 44-
hour week. Forrherly a 48-hour week was
worked.
We have a Jersey cow with huge swellings on
both knees and also, on one leg, low to the
coronet. They seem to cause her a lot of pain,
and, although they are of long standing, seem
to get neither better nor worse. Could you
diagnose this malady and advise on a treat-
ment 2—9067. s
The swellings are known as hygroma. Quite
recently they have been shown to be due (at
all events in some cases) to infection of the
knee joint by the same organism which is re-
sponsible for contagious abortion in cattle.
Treatment is very difficult and requires surgical
interference. It should not be attempted by
a layman.
Could you suggest any cheap liquid that
wotdd consolidate this mixture, recommended
by the N.S.W. Department of Agriculture:
Dicalcic phosphate, . two parts; coarse salt,
two parts ? We have used ordinary bone-
meal with salt in troughs, and find the
sheep spill it when eating it. A heavy
wind blows the fine bonemeal out of the trough,
and bicalcic phosphate is finer stuff than bone-
meal. Bicalcic phosphate is strongly recom-
mended for sheep in the New England district,
and I think if it could *be given to them in
block form to lick they would not ' spill it,
and the wind could not blow it away. —9lBl.
The usual procedure is to put out only small
quantities of lick and to moisten with molasses
one part, water two parts. This method is
usually quite satisfactory and can be improved
by placing heavy weights on the moistened lick
for a time to ensure consolidation.
My child’s pony mare has a swelling under
the mane as hard as a board. It extends from
the wither to the back of head and at times
seems to extend to the tail. The pony was
affected the same way last spring and in four
months recovered. I was told the cause of the
swelling was the result of a bite on the neck
by another horse. —9oso.
Can’t advise without examination. It is a
case for a vet.
Can a N.S.W. municipal council, by declar-
ing bees noxious animals, or by. any ‘ by-law,
compel people r to remove their bees outside the
village area ? —8674.
Yes. Numerous instances-have arisen where
councils have found it necessary to exercise con-
trol over the keeping of bees. They are apt to
become a nuisance’ s if they are kept alongside
such a place as a public school, also when their
natural food fails and they invade the stores
in the town seeking pollard or other food.


SHADOW SHOWS.
Whatever may be said to the detriment
of Australian films, the producers try
to give good value in the matter of
local color. In “The Hayseeds,” at Syd-
ney Civic, almost everything Australian,
from kookaburras, native bears and
hikers to the Harbor Bridge, a cocoanut
palm in the Sydney Gardens and the
brass plate on Mr. Colvin’s lottery office,
is brought in somewhere. Only a bush-
fire and a surf scene are missing.
The Hayseeds’ dairy farm is interest-
ing ; there are no grazing paddocks, and
the house is surrounded by thickly-tim-
bered and scrub-covered hills. The hero is
disclosed prospecting for gold in a creek,
which is evidently down by the springers’
paddock. A party of hikers, several in
ballet costumes, stop in front of the
verandah for lunch, and find what
appears to be a disused cricket pitch on
which to stage their ballet. Under such
conditions it isn’t strange that Dad should
find it hard to pay the mortgage, and it
hardly seems right of him to blame the
price of wool as he does, though he is
a dairy-farmer.
The Hayseed children are depicted as a
collection of nitwits. No doubt such
characters are meant for caricatures, but
even a caricature should have some re-
semblance to truth. It is time such films
as “The Hayseeds” and “On Our Selec-
tion” were dropped, even though the
producers and exhibitors may be able to
claim, like the old-time vaudeville singer,
that “it’s getting them the money.” These
libels on our up-country folk may not
do much damage here, but they are likely
to create a disastrous impression of Aus-
tralians in Britain and the U.S.A.
Katie Towers (as Mum) and Kenneth
Brampton (as Mr. Townleigh) turn in
sound performances along conventional
lines. Cecil Kellaway adds nothing to
the part of Dad, and Shirley Dale and
Arthur Clarke are for the most part life-
less. The dialogue is artificial and old-
fashioned.
v- v *
“Torch Singer,” at the Prince Edward,
is another variant on the one about the
girl who is forced to give up her baby
by poverty. We see Claudette Colbert
seeking admission to a maternity home.
A kindly old nun asks the name of the
prospective infant’s father. But the sinner
has put her betrayer out of her life. Soon
she is a success as a cabaret crooner.
And now come yearnings for the child
whom she was forced to part with when
she left the hospital. A touch of original-
ity intrudes here ; she becomes a radio
aunt and tries to get in touch with her
offspring over the air. Who should return
at this stage but the deserter? His de-
fection, it seems, was a mistake ; he loved
her then, he loves her still.
Miss Colbert registers the complete
gamut of emotions customary to one in
her position—misery and shame as she
stands in her shabby clothes at the con-
vent door; seductive cynicism as she
leans against a night club piano in Pari-
sian clothes and croons defiance at light-
o’-loves ; melancholy, which finds expres-
sion in alcoholism and threatens her with
a physical and mental breakdown, as she
broods over her lost child ; indignation
and scorn when the seducer returns ; rap-
ture when he discovers the child ; the re-
birth of love as she sits with him on the
stairs after the child has gone to bed.
She does it all —and particularly the
crooning—with unimpeachable efficiency,
but there is so much of her that she
becomes boresome before the thing is
half over. Ricardo Cortez is well cast as
her self-sacrificing friend.
“Midnight Club” represents the ideal
combination—an American production
with a largely English cast and a London
setting. Unfortunately it is a gangster.
London gangsters lack suspense because
no one can be persuaded that English
criminals will commit cold-blooded
murder. In this film George Raft is an
American detective who promises Scot-
land Yard that he will expose Clive
Brook and his gang. Brook and his allies
advance on Raft with revolvers aimed
through their pockets, and they also take
him for a ride ; but it all falls flat for
the reason mentioned above. The only
vestige of a thrill occurs early in the pic-
ture when Raft bails up Brook’s accom-
plice, Helen Vinson, and relieves her of
some stolen diamonds. The audience
mistakes him for a hi-jacker. The dia-
logue is bright and the Phillips Oppen-
heim plot is interesting, though founded
on the improbable, not to say ridiculous,
assumption that Clive Brook and Helen
Vinson had perfect doubles to provide
them with alibis while they were
a-burgling.
# * *
“Stage Mother,” at the Plaza, gives
Alice Brady opportunities to contort her
mobile features in anguish over the harsh
ways of the world. She is a minor
vaudeville artist who loses her husband,
a trapezist, in an extremely realistic acci-
dent, and is driven by poverty to leave
her baby girl with deceased’s acidulously
righteous family. Later she makes
enough to claim the child (now Maureen
O’Sullivan) and her troubles begin afresh.
Her problems are to make a vaudeville
star of Maureen and to keep young
men out of the girl’s life. She is success-
ful in both enterprises till Franchot Tone,
a wealthy young artist, appears. She
settles Tone’s hash by blackmailing his
mother out of 30,000 dollars —a blend of
pleasure and business which turns
Maureen against her for a while. And
then, in heaven’s and the producer’s good
time, the happy ending.
There is a deal too much of Alice
Brady, sound emotionalist though she is.
The back-stage sequences are well up to
standard.
“Scram! ” (American for “Get! ” or
“Clear Out!”) is the latest Laurel and
Hardy. Acquitted before a fearsome-
looking magistrate L. and H. presently
find themselves in the magistrate’s palace,
wearing his glorious pyjamas, and revel-
ling with his Junoesque wife, who, owing

to Laurel’s well-meaning ministrations,
has got hilariously drunk. The magistrate
returns as the orgy is at its height.
The comedians repeat all their old tricks,
having reached the triumphant stage
where, if they varied their methods in
the slightest degree, their public would
be disappointed.
v- v *
“Blonde Bombshell,” at the Regent,
is a double-quick time satire on the life
of a film star. Jean Harlow, as the star,
has no brains, but ballyhoo makes her
Hollywood’s most talked-about identity.
She supports a tipsy, plebeian father, a
moronish brother and three German
sheepdogs, and is robbed right and
left by her servants. The bane
of her life is her vociferous press-
agent, Lee Tracy; one who would
dynamite a cathedral if he thought that
it would get her name on the front page.
Lee ends an affair with a marquis by
having the aristo arrested as a prohibited
immigrant, and he also comes between
Jean and another possible husband. Other
feats of the kind, performed one and
all in publicity’s holy name, lead up to
the denouement, which almost brought
the Regent’s roof down on Saturday
night. The dialogue is racy and the
situations dovetail perfectly. Jean Har-
low and Tracy are great in their degrad-
ing way, and fine work is also done by
Frank Morgan, C. Aubrey Smith and
Una Merkel.
“The Worst Woman in Paris” demon-
strates yet again that “there is so much
good in the worst of us” —you know the
rest. Benita Hume is the sinner and
Adolphe Menjou is the man who pays.
Presently Miss Hume finds herself in the
U.S.A., where she gets mixed up in a
train-wreck. She comes to in a virtuous
Kansas home. The son (Harvey Stephens),
a college principal, becomes infatuated
with her, but she steers his heart back
to Helen Chandler, and returns purified
to Paris, where she places her jewels at
the disposal of Menjou—this exquisite
creature having been reduced to ironing
his own pants and frying sausages by
gaslight. Stilted acting makes the thing
even worse than it sounds.

Pat Hanna’s latest production, “Waltz-
ing Matilda,” at Melb. Hoyt’s, was
photographed partly in the vicinity of
the Heidelberg gasworks, though that
aesthetic masterpiece doesn’t appear in the
picture. The hero and Hanna are pur-
sued by a private detective and, after
various adventures, are run to earth at
a sheep station, where their pursuer ex-
plains that he is after the hero to tell
him he is heir to £20,000. This paves
the way to the inevitable nuptials, which
are celebrated by a station ball of Gen-
goultian proportions.
The production falls far short of
“Diggers in Blighty.” It is difficult to
decide which is the greater irrelevance
—the plot or the shots of Light Horse-
men apparently engaged in repelling an
attack of kangaroos, sheep and cattle.
These properties used to be rapturously
received in the infancy of the Australian
film industry, but they are tiresome now-
adays. The love episodes are sketched
hastily in passing, when they ought to
be the prime motive. There are some
hearty laughs at the spectacle of Field
Fisher bootlegging his own whisky.

“Flying Devils,” at Sydney Capitol,
tells a plain story with a plain point and
doesn’t strain the probabilities overmuch.
Ralph Bellamy, who has a silver plate
in his skull, controls a troupe of ’plane-
stunters. He cares for and trusts nobody,
and lives in a mental hell of his own.
He has married a girl (Arline Judge) who
does parachute drops. Enter an eager
young man (Bruce Cabot) whose brother
is one of Bellamy’s pilots. The rest is
triangle, tragedy, sacrifice and happy
fade-out.
It is possible to sympathise with every-
one in the cast, and the pictures of aerial
acrobatics blend reality and fake with
remarkable skill.
“Meet the Baron” is farce without a
ray of wit. The apex of its hilarity is
reached when the males smite one an-
other on the skulls with mallets and 25
bathing beauties cavort around in as near
the altogether as our various censorships
will permit. The ladies maintain their
permanent waves and enamelled faces
amid cascades of water in a way which
says much for the work of America’s
beauticians. J. Durant, Z. Pitts and E.
M>. Oliver figure in this melancholy opus.
Sundry Shows
“Jonah and the Whale,” John Bridie’s
satire on a Biblical theme, was the
second offering of the McMahon season
at Melb. Garrick. Jonah (Collins Hilton)
is shown as the uplifter of his native vil-
lage. A commercial traveller (Jos.
Ambler) happens along and tells him of
the superior wickedness of Nineveh and
the prophet goes off to punish the city.
He funks his job and takes a passage
to Tarshish. The ship meets a storm
and the sailors throw him overboard.
In the next scene Jonah is in the whale’s
belly, listening to words of wisdom from
the animal. It asks him if he is a good
swimmer as it wants to take a drink,
and there is the sound of a miniature
Niagara as the scene closes. In the next
act Jonah is being expected by a women’s
club in Nineveh. Instead of an inspira-
tional address he curses the city and pro-
nounces its doom in 40 days. The people
repent, Jehovah forgives them and the
prophet’s professional competence is dis-
credited.
It would have been more in
accordance with modern experience of
prophets if Jonah had founded a sect,
built a magnificent church with the
offerings of the faithful plus a bank mort-
gage, started a newspaper and become
one of the most popular preachers in
the Assyrian capital, eventually dying in
the odor of sanctity, with a fortune in
real estate, branches all over the world
and a board of directors to carry on the
business. There is a girl (Thelma Scott)
who follows Jonah after the Thais model,
but the idea is not developed.
After all, a writer ought to add some-
thing to what is already given, but Bridie,
adds nothing that improves on the story
told by the old Hebrew chronicler.
Nevertheless, the piece had its funny
moments, and it was staged in a bright
mood of parody. Collins Hilton looked
his prophetical part but failed to convey
the feeling. Thelma Scott gave every-
thing an equal significance, which means
no significance. Jos. Ambler’s bagman
was amusingly vulgar, and Phoebe
Marks’s club president was a brilliant ex-
position of a type well known to journal-
ists who have the melancholy job of re-
porting the proceedings of similar
societies in Melbourne.

The dramatic event of the week in
Melbourne was the Lud Mayor’s wed-
ding. It might almost be described as an
artistic renaissance. The entire theatrical
talent of the great metropolis was mobil-
ised, General Blarney’s myrmidons pro-
viding the necessary comic relief by halt-
ing a Black Maria in front of the closed
doors of the cathedral in the middle of
the ceremony. This witty sally was paid
the greatest tribute ever accorded a
comedian in local theatrical history, the
laughter extending a quarter of a mile
both ways along Flinders-street, 400
yards across Prince’s Bridge, and all the
way up Swanston-street as far as the
Bourke-street intersection, even the tops
of tall buildings ringing with the merri-
ment.

Prof. Bernard Heinze, of Melbourne,
conducted an orchestral concert for chil-
dren in Sydney Town Hall on an after-
noon last week. He explained (with
illustrations by members of the A.B.C.
orchestra) the characteristics of the prin-
cipal instruments in the band, and said
something about the various items of the
programme before they were performed.
Most of these were simple and melo-
dious, but, presumably as a sort of wild
experiment, the prof, included in the
symposium Honegger’s “Pacific 231.” It
is supposed to represent a steam locomo-
tive in full career, but that sort of thing
is done more realistically on the stage
and in the nursery. Honegger (this is
official) thought about a spiritual loco-
motive running on rails in the fourth
dimension, emitting the anguished yelps
of an electron oppressed by the Ein-
steinian limits of velocity and saddened
by reflections on the stupidity of a world
that has more admiration for cheek than
for genius. If any youngster got that
out of it he deserves a medal.

THE PALETTE.
Aileen Dent strikes no new note in
her portraiture at the Rookwood Gal-
leries, Melb. In her landscapes, however,
there are signs of development. Most
painters appear to be able to approach
a landscape in a more objective manner
than a human being, probably because
a tree, a cloud or a mountain can’t come
along later and complain about the like-
ness. A study of the Sydney Harbor
Bridge in an evening gown of mist and
smoke looks to be nearer the real thing
than most statements concerning that
edifice present critic has seen.
John Eldershaw, who lives in an an-
cient mill in Tasmania and paints his
surroundings in water-color and two
manners, has been on view at Melbourne
T-'ine Arts. Eldershaw has a keen eye
for the picturesque and the unusual.
He puts them down without bothering
himself excessively about the tonal
qualities. The result is that you want
to go to the places he has painted to see
what they really look like. Some of his
pictures, however, have more than this
topographical interest —notably “Twi-
light” and “Mount Olympus, Lake St.
Clair.” In the last-named the sombre
beauty of the hill-imprisoned water has
been caught with considerable agility.
Charles Nuttall is a journalist of con-
siderable versatility. His inspirational
talks on the wireless have soothed many
a mother’s savage breast and made many
a father feel that life is not all gas-bills
and unsatisfied judgments. The latest out-
put of his muse was a show of etchings
at Newman’s, Melbourne. Nuttall is skil-
ful with the needle, though some of his
work suggests that he has been looking
at Lionel Lindsay and Van Raalte more
closely than at Nature. His talents as
an illustrator come out best in two rapid
impressions—of a Javanese cockfight and
of two bulls in mortal combat.
Douglas Pratt, hitherto known mostly
as a painter of quiet-toned landscapes in
oil and water-color, has a show at Syd-
ney’s Grosvenor Galleries principally
notable for excellent pencil drawings.
His gum-tree -studies in this medium
challenge comparison with Hans Heysen’s
and there are some glimpses of the Syd-
ney water-front and of city streets which
convey impressions of distance, tone and
even of color more adequately than this
artist has ever achieved in polychrome.
William Hunter, acclaimed as the latest
great genius—there is a new one in Mel-
bourne every week —is a self-taught etcher
and has been at it for only three years
His progress has been prodigious, but
ought to be received with reservations.
What one recognises here is not a new
statement in art, but a very skilful re-
statement of what has been said before —
the use, in short, of a well-tried conven-
tion. Mr. Hunter has produced some
eminently saleable goods, as the red tabs
show.
“F.S.”: Victorian art promises to be
the Cinderella of the Melb. centenary
celebrations. After the claims of the
painters to having had a small part in the
cultural history of the city had been
almost forgotten the committee bestirred
itself and appointed a small board of
artists, by no means representative of all
the schools. This decided to hold a dis-
play of art wares in the Exhibition, which
is equivalent to running the Melbourne
Cup at the Stadium. Since visitors inter-
ested in our art will go to the National
Gallery, one of the galleries should have
been cleared of its imported products
and given over to the indigenous article.
This has been done on less important
occasions, but a characteristic of the Mel-
bourne painter nowadays is his lack of a
strong faith in himself.
In the intervals between milking cows
Harley C. Griffiths (Sedon Galleries, Mel-
bourne) paints pictures, and, if one didn’t
know that the youthful artist had had
some years of city training, there would
be surprise at such pictures coming out
of a Victorian dairying district. They
are reminiscent of the careful old Dutch
realists, both in their degree of finish
and their low tone and sombre coloring.
In fact, one or two Griffiths still-lifes, with
a bit more weathering, could be mis-
taken for the work of one of those
ancient draughtsmen. More light gets
into the portrait of a lady, and “The
Stone Crusher,” a big picture of a fami-
liar piece of rural machinery, is an illus-
tration in which more attention has been
given to tonal values than usually
happens with illustrations. Some of the
water-colors are impressionistic and
might have been done by anybody but
the painter of the oil-colors.
“F.S.”: Speaking of Gertrude Stein
and her futile attempts to make a hit by
sponsoring successive futurist painters
who continually let her down, the Red
Page reviewer justly remarked:
Modernistic English of this description
suffers from the same defect as most modern-
istic art. Its devotees make a virtue of slop-
piness.
They have to, because they base their art
on what they call “inspiration.” The
number of young Australian painters who
have produced bad copies of Matisse
and Cezanne under the spur of inspira-
tion is saddening. They are hailed as
geniuses and nothing is thereafter heard
of them. Not that there is anything
wrong with inspiration as a goad to the
acquisition of knowledge, but it is in-
spiration as a substitute for knowledge
which is responsible for the infantile art
of recent exhibitions. When one is
so hungry one feels one could eat a
bullock —that is inspiration ; when one
sits down to eat and finds one can con-
sume only a couple of chops—that is
reality. And Miss Stein as a critic suffers
from the same complaint as the “great”
painters she discovered.

CHRISTMAS BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY THE ENDEAVOUR PRESS
“JONAH,”
by LOUIS STONE.
Acknowledged to be one of the greatest Aus-
tralian works of fiction.
The late Mr. John Galsworthy said: “I’ve lapped
up your novel, which I think extraordinarily
actual, vivid and good.” This is an epic of the
city’s back streets. Jonah is an unforgettable
character, as truly Australian in his way as any
. 'an from the bush. The book will surprise
those who now read it for the first time by its
dramatic power in telling of a phase of Aus-
tralian life which has almost entirely vanished.
“NEW AUSTRALIAN STATES,”
by U. R. ELLIS.
This book, by a leading Australian authority,
contains a complete history of the States sub-
division schemes. It outlines the course of the
struggle in which Victoria and Queensland
secured their independence, and it traverses the
efforts made by various part's of existing States
to secure self-government. The bases on which
modern cases for subdivision of the States are
constructed, also, are fully discussed, and there
is a comprehensive index which sets the seal
on the utility of the volume as the leading
reference book on the New States Movement.
“NIGHTS ASHORE,”
by CAPTAIN JACK HAMILTON.
A maritime novel by an author who knows life
on board ship thoroughly.
The adventures of Captain Muggs and his ship-
mates are most divertingly told. They roam
the Pacific from Newcastle to Sydney, Fiji, Nor-
folk Island, the New Guinea goldfields and the
treasure-island of Cocos. There are many
episodes of love and laughter, and a quaint but
pleasant sailorman’s philosophy of married life.
It is a convincing description of life on board
the staunch little coasters which carry coal in
all weathers from the ports of New South Wales.

Flying in New Guinea
“Salamaua”: The day The Bulletin
published its leading article (B. 29/11/ ’33)
about the sloth of the Civil Aviation
Department, N. Guinea Airways held its
annual meeting in Adelaide. The G.A.
people carry most of the traffic between
the coast and the inland towns. They have
laid down 23 out of the 27 aerodromes,
which they allow lesser organisations to
use without charge. This year they have
carried over 4000 tons of freight, with
three months still to go, which is equal to
the total tonnage carried last year. Over
14,500 tons has been carried in six years
without serious mishap. In 2} years they
have lifted an average of \s\ tons per
day exclusive of passengers, who have
numbered 15,000. Their clients have
flown li million miles with G.A. pilots in
12,000 flights.
Because of the nature of the country,
the most rigid inspection and overhaul
system is necessary, but accidents are
virtually non-existent. The longest line
of flight-route in use is from Wau to
Moresby, which is so well patronised
that the co. is considering putting larger
machines on to it. Financially, the co.
is a success, even though at present it
bears the burden of keeping in order
the free-for-all aerodromes which it has
constructed.
The Peak Year Plan
“Titre”: In common with many other
sugar-producing countries, Queensland
has a method of restricting excess pro-
duction, though in this case the scheme
is a domestic one and not connected with
the Chadbourne plan, by which over-
seas countries have been endeavoring to
obtain a similar curtailment of output.
Bananaland’s method is known as the
Peak Year Plan, and was initiated in
1929.
Under this a “peak tonnage” of
sugar, based on the maximum output
from each mill up to 1929, is permitted
to each mill. Sugar up to peak amount
is paid for at sugar-pool prices—£14
16s 9d. a ton this year. For sugar pro-
duced in excess of the allotment only
export value is paid, and that only when
final adjustment has been made.
While it has its advantages, the scheme
has its drawbacks. A case in point is
that of Inkerman, which reached its quota
early in November. It had then crushed
about 65 per cent, of the district crop,
and a notice has been issued stating that
payment for the balance will not be made
to growers until after May next. This
will hit hard a lot of growers with un-
cut cane, while the mill itself is on a
sticky wicket, for, under the Cane Prices
Act, it must carry on crushing. At the
beginning of December, Inkerman had
exceeded its crushing quota by 25,000
tons. It has applied to the Central
Sugar Cane Prices Board for a variation
of the regulations in order to help it
cope with the situation.
“X.T.M.”: Civilisation may be work-
ing wonders in Papua, but the Papuan
still seems to die young and in abund-
ance. The last report of the Moresby
Administration shows that the population
under 15 years of age in some districts
is as high as 40 per cent, of the whole.
In Australia the figure is about 27 per
cent. The death-rate even in Moresby
villages, which are the best-cared-for
on the big island, is 27.5 per 1000. Still,
there is not much danger of the race
dying out, for the birth-rate is 44 per
1000.

Queensland Police Commissioner Ryan
is to retire next May after 41 years’ ser-
vice. He was the first ordinary ranker
to rise to the job, previous heads having
entered the service as cadet officers. He
goes on leave at once.

The North Queensland “Register” has
issued an excellent Sugar Annual
(N.Q. Newspaper Co., Townsville;
Is. 6d.), which will fill a gap in the list
of trade directories. The book is a com-
plete guide to the technicalities, personal-
ties, facilities and statistics of the indus-
try, together with detailed industrial in-
formation. Something of the sort was
needed.

“M.T.”: One real Australian has just
enjoyed his holiday and has returned to
his birthplace with his family full of the
ponders of W.A. He is the Reverend
James Noble, the only member of the
House of Binghi who has ever taken
holy orders. He lives at Yarrabah Mis-
sion (N.Q.). Once he worked at the
Roper River mission, and it was there
that his family of five young Australians
was born. He is a quiet chap, possessed
of natural eloquence and a clear-think-
ing brain.
* * * *
“X.”: The census figures have de-
stroyed a lot of fond delusions about
the populations of northern cities. Rock-
hampton came up to sample with 29,373
against the statistician’s guess of 30,000,
but Townsville, believed to have 32,000
inhabitants, proved to be 6000 short of
expectancy and Ipswich 4000 short. The
most curious feature of the figures is
the preponderance of females in centres
which have always been looked upon as
the haunt of the sturdy pioneer. Any-
body who wants 800-odd girls, for in-
stance, will find them available in Rock-
hampton, and if that isn’t enough for
him there is a surplus of them of 1600
in Toowoomba over availables males.

“Kaloa”: Head-hunting still goes on
in Papua, even in administered areas, and
it will continue until some genius can
thump a new viewpoint into the aborigi-
nal head. After one foray in which the
Sukis wiped out a whole village except
for one small girl and a casual male,
Patrol Officer Hides asked the raiders
who were rounded up why they had done
it. “You must have known,” he said, “that
we were sure to catch you.” “Certainly,”
“Well, girls, it looks as if we'll have to postpone our Christmas social and dance.
There’s not a man to be found in the yard.”
replied the unperturbed decapitators, “but
you see there were a lot of young widows
in the village who could not marry until
we got a few heads for them, so we had
no choice.” Some learned anthropolo-
gists still defend head-hunting on the
ground that it consolidates the com-
munity of the raiders. As Hubert
Murray says in his last annual report,
“raids do not consolidate the community
of the raided ; but the question is rarely
considered from their point of view.”
* * * *
“Pen-and-ink”: Referring particularly
to Cairns, “X.” (B. 29/11 /’33) lauds the
progressive spirit of northern cities. A
short visit to the Far North leaves one
with the impression that Cairns has left
them all behind. It has an art
society, a literary society, a naturalists’
club and an Alpine club, the lastnamed
given over to climbing about the ridges
of the northern ranges and walking for 30
miles for fun through tropic nights. What-
ever pleasure is in that is the knowledge
of its members, but it establishes the
hardiness of young northern men and
flappers—and a few older ones like Der-
went Vallance, the president of the
Alpineers. Behind all these organisations
one finds the energy of Victor Kennedy.
He is the author of the big guide book
quoted by “X.” which won a public
word of admiration from Opposition-
leader Scullin when Scullin was in Cairns.
Kennedy also wrote a biography of the
late A. J. Draper, one of the big men of
the North, and he has written two or three
other books. In Brisbane the other day
he made a passionate appeal to the Royal
Queensland Artists to help the struggling
body in Cairns —a thousand miles to the
northward. The result was promises from
Brisbane’s best, including Daphne Mayo,
Lancaster and others, to donate and
lend things to the Art Gallery in the
making at Cairns.

“Nakanai”: “Kaloa” (B. 6/12/’33)
stood in admiration before our N.G. fly-
ing and crime records, but he would never
have mentioned either of them if he had
contemplated us drinking beer. We can
challenge Townsville with confidence,
Broken Hill with pleasure, and fairly float
away from Camooweal at Christmas-
time. There are 2900 whites, including
about 900 females, here, counting babies
in arms and missionaries. Besides that,
there are 1200 kong kongs, a third of
them below the bacchic age of consent.
But among us we manage the respect-
able total of 7947 gallons of spirits per
annum (say three gallons per male adult),
plus 4313 gallons of wine (say one and
half gallons per adult), plus 40 gallons of
beer per head, or a pint a day, women
and Chinamen included, which isn’t bad
going. When I explain to you poor
Aussies down under that up here in
many places you have to drink beer,
because water is dangerous, and that taxa-
tion is the lowest in the British Empire —
a mere 10 per cent, of the value of our
exports —I expect a rush which will make
the price of plantations go up and help
me to sell out and retire to Sydney.
* * * *
“Sheller”: One of the more recent
afffictions of the hapless New Guinea
traders and planters has been the great
increase in the number of unlicensed and
alien trochus-shell fishers. In the smaller
islands of the New Guinea groups
planters have been trying to make up for
the unpayable price of copra by fishing
for trochus as a sideline. The alien in-
vaders, in well-found craft, set in on a
reef and do not leave it until it has been
stripped clean, though under N.G. regu-
lations a proportion of the shell on the
reefs must be left. Worse even than that,
they do not hesitate to take shell of any
size, even one capable of producing only
a single shirt button being fair game.
The result is that natural replenishment
of that particular reef is impossible unless
it is artificially restocked with shell from
other reefs —an undertaking quite outside
the powers of the hard-up planter to-day.

A chicken from New South’s past came
home to roost in Brisbane when an
exhibition of local antiques was opened.
Prominent in the exhibits was a plain
parchment address to Sir George Bowen,
Bananaland’s first Governor. As pre-
sented by “the working men of Bris-
bane,” it expresses thanks to the Queen
and her Ministers for their “total dis-
regard of the sinister influences brought
to bear on the struggle for the separation
of Queensland from N.S.W. by the neigh-
boring colony.”
* * * *
“Kaloa”: Griffiths, the 68-year-old
brigadier who administers the N. Guinea
Mandate, and Murray, in Papua, who is
72, are nasty contradictions of the
SteVens policy of too-old-at-60. Murray
still gets about like a two-year-old, and
Griffiths, who is a Welshman bred to
mountains, with an inquiring mind which
prompts him to turn up unexpectedly in
out-of-the-way spots, has badly shaken
the dry bones of an Administration long
accustomed to the pomp and circum-
stance of the Wisdom era. Recently,
when there were hints that all was not
well in New Ireland, he arrived at Nama-
tanai in the centre of the island one
morning. Instead of coming heralded
with trumpets down the Kavieng road, he
had landed at Bom, which is a Chinese
trading centre, and walked over the local
mountain, no mean climb even for a
young man. After inspecting the station
for an hour or so, he disappeared into the
wilds in another direction. This is the
sort of thing that gets on a civil ser-
vant’s nerves.
* * * *
“Vic”: Townsville Council was
startled the other evening to receive a
letter from a southern theatrical firm
asking it to please forward a couple of
goats. The northern city will do its
best. Two goats won’t make much dif-
ference to its famous scavenging corps,
though the inhabitants can’t understand
why the blazes anybody who hasn’t got
goats should be moved to want them.
* * * *
“Innisfail”: Cane farniers along the
Johnstone are beginning to wake up to
the fact that birds are among the
cheapest and most useful laborers in the
fields. The Cane Pests Destruction Board
pays Is. a pint for cane grubs, and as an
ibis can collect about a pint of grubs
per day he is worth 30s. a month or so
to the landowner in the ploughing season.
Nobody calls the ibis a nuisance round
Halifax, and there are other birds which
are being encouraged to come round by
the establishment of sanctuaries. Investi-
gation of bird utility is a matter which
the C.S.I.R. might profitably take up.
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
The vice-regal car no longer parks outside
St. Martin’s Hospital. Lady Wilson has
vacated her room, and has returned to Govern-
ment House.
Our Governor is having a busy time present-
ing prizes at the school break-ups. Marjorie
accompanied her father to the Brisbane Boys’
College at Toowong, and looked ever so attrac-
tive, wearing a periwinkle blue frock with shady
white hat. Tea was set in the dining-room for
a few officials, who were received by principal
P. M. Hamilton and Mrs. Hamil-
ton, the latter wearing deep
saxe-blue mixed with grey and a
blue hat.
Madame Goosens-Viceroy was
indisposed for the Austral
Choir’s tea-party in her honor.
However, guest number two,
Ethel Daw, turned up in a
floral-patterned georgette frock
much bespattered with orange
and green flowers, and wearing
a beige hat. President R. J.
Archibald and conductor E. R.
B. Jordan did the little bit of
speechmaking before songs were
warbled by Frith Edmonds and
May Jordan.
Nell Henderson, daughter of
the principal of Emmanuel Col-
lege, has her trousseau all ready
for December 20. Her sister
Grace decorated the college with
greenery and twinkling lights
and hostessed a party. Friends
came along with flour-sifters and other useful
gifts for the bride’s kitchen.
An addition to the Lady Mayoress’s sewing
kit is an extremely pretty thimble, the gift of
the Social Service League, of which she has been
president. She was the league’s guest at luncheon
the other day. Garbed in date-brown mariette,
topped with cream picture hat, Mrs. Greene
said that she had found the work difficult but
very pleasant. Mrs. Forgan Smith, on whose
black marocain frock perched pert little nastur-
tiums; Mrs. Percy Pease and Irene Longman
all had something nice to say.
Fourteen of our leading artists are airing
their pictures at the Gainsborough Gallery.
Crowds should be lured up the steps, for on
the walls hang 80 pictures of the smallish type
suitable for Christmas gifts. Mt. Nebo Road
has captured the imagination of C. H. Lan-
caster and William Bustard. It was left to
Vera Leichney to supply an oil painting of our
lovely jacaranda-tree. Vida Lahey, Enid Dick-
son, Daphne Mayo and Roy Parkinson are
other contributors. Donald Cameron opened
the show.
The Lyceum Club rang down the curtain for
the year at a party given by president Mrs. W.
Young. Her black mariette frock sparkled
with sequins, and a red rose nestled on her
shoulder. Members were dressed to represent
a song or book. Matron Paten pinned a
mouse to her frock to represent “What Women
Fear,” and took the gaud. Beatrice McCul-
lough was responsible for a short musical pro-
gramme.
Boyd Cullen, one of our best best men, has
got tired of filling that role. He has an-
nounced his engagement to Merle, youngest
daughter of Mrs. William Raff, Hamilton.
To qualify for a game on the New Farm
bowling club’s green the other afternoon, the
birth certificate had to show a date not less than
70 years ago. About 100 took part. The win-
ning rink included A. Campbell, who had just
celebrated his 77th birthday.
Our best aviatrix, Mrs. H. B. Bonney, en-
thralled 300 pupils of the Corinda State School
as they heard her describe some of her experi-
ences. ' They are to write an essay about it,
the prize to be a flight with- her in her Gypsy
Moth.
The Repertory Society closed its. 1933 season
with “Nine Till Six.” Sixteen of our brightest
girls placed themselves under the wing of Bar-
bara Sisley, and a fine performance resulted.
Lady Mayoress Greene has owned up! She
confessed at a public meeting that she had
just come from her dressmaker, where she
had ordered up-to-the-minute slacks. She will
don them at Caloundra Beach, where she and
the Lud Mayor are to spend Christmas.


SPOR TING
NOTI ONS
Under the Whip
Racing like a seasoned horse, the
Dominion-bred Sir John captured the
Kirkham Stakes at Warwick Farm. It
was his first outing, but Ned Moss, who
paid 725 guineas for the big son of
Limond, did not forget to back him, the
price receding from sevens to threes. Sir
John behaved admirably at the barrier,
and he fairly worried the pacemaker, Sun
Clad, out of the big end of the prize.
Caravel Girl, at 25 to 1, shaped
better than Booth’s other representative,
Memento, and got the minor placing.
Randwick trainer E. F. Walker was not
at all perturbed when Gloriole was
beaten rather badly in a trial at Rand-
wick by Red Shadow. The Heroic mare
was always favorite for the first division
of the Camden Handicap (9 to 4), but
she had to be ridden right out to defeat
Jacko and the consistent Happyendo.
Brisbane-owned and -trained Noel Soldat
enhanced his prospects for the Villiers by
running fourth. He eased in the betting
to eights after fours had been taken.
The second division was supposed to
be a good thing for Omagh, who was at a
short price throughout. This Page
selected Veilantif (5 to 2), and her bril-

EIGHTEEN TINIES THIS SE6SOH ,
liancy stood to her in a close finish with
Touchit, who flew from the Leger. A
maiden performer, Kagal, was third;
Omagh stopped to a walk in the last fur-
long. He did not appreciate the fast pace
set by Veilantif, and is a squibby fellow
anyhow.
Mrs. Pat Osborne’s handsome mare
Mince Pie failed in Melbourne, but she
did well after her return to Sydney, and
in looks was decidedly superior to the
rest of the field in the Warwick Handi-
cap. Prowler was favorite ; Mince Pie
was backed from sevens to fours. After
trailing Prowler to the turn, the big chest-
nut mare went past him in the straight as
if he were anchored, and won as she liked
from Enamour and Elmaros. Mince Pie
is engaged in the Summer Cup and Tatt.’s
Cup, and with 7st. 51b. in the former race
she will be a tough proposition. Prowler,
despite his breeding, is not a genuine
stayer. The Victorian mare Whitsome
will need to improve to pay her way in
Sydney, though she was neglected in the
betting for her Stable-mate, Enamour.
Cordova was withdrawn from the
Farm Novice, and Richard Wootton
relied upon Prince’s Daughter, who was
backed from fourteens to eights. Hers
was a capital performance. She went
wide at the turn, but struggled on gamely
to beat Salted Almond and Chiefava.
The favorite, Roxburgh, was struck by
the barrier, but he ran well enough to
suggest a victory before long. Oliora,
after meeting with interference at the
turn, finished fourth.
The Doric filly lonic (8 to 1), who car-
ries the colors of E. J. Watt, was one of
the last to leave the barrier in the Maiden
Nursery. She finished brilliantly to beat
Mystic Spell and Gay Lass. Tierce, the
dam of lonic, is by The Welkin horse
Thrice ; both Doric and Tierce are owned
by Watt.
For Rosehill on Saturday:
Corinthian Cup: Tatyoon; next,
Happyendo.
Dundas Handicap: Noel Soldat; next,
Touchit.
December Handicap: Elmaros ; next,
Regal Star.
Carlingford Mile: Ranchero; next,
Zeus.

From earliest times members of the
V.R.C. committee have shown fondness
for jumpers. Septimus Miller had Red-
leap ; the Manifolds landed several Grand
Nationals ; L. K. S. Mackinnon carried
off the G.N. Hurdle with Merunqua and
Kentle; and J. A. MacLeod took the
G.N. Steeple with Sandhurst, whom he
raced in conjunction with a friend, C. F.
Taylor. At Moonee Valley MacLeod’s
colors were to the fore in the Kalkallo
Trial Hurdle. Starting at 6 to 1 Nyerimi-
lang won nicely from the fast-finishing
Varquador, with Buckler an encouraging
third. Buckler is trained by F. W. Hoy-
sted for L. K. S. Mackinnon. Nyerimi-
lang was presented to MacLeod by Philip
Russell, also of the V.R.C. committee,
who bred the nag—he is by King Ingoda
from Welsh Maid (imp.).
Those who went to the Valley saw a
new racing track brought into use ; it
provides a long straight for events run
over a distance of more than seven fur-
longs. There now are two judge’s boxes.
For middle-distance events portion of the
permanent running rail is removed, im-
mediately opposite the members’ reserve,
and horses when finishing pass over the
steeplechase track on to the course
proper. Magoot, a former pony per-
former, was the first to win over the
“new” course, his success being gained
in the Koombahla Trial. In this event
he deposed Ezic from favoritism. Ezic
dropped out of the picture three fur-
longs from home, and Magoot, a gelding
by Magpie from Tullulah, by Tressady
from the Oakleigh Plate winner Tullia,
won handsomely from Affability and
Great Bear.
J. G. Russell, a new owner, captured
the Laluma Handicap with Glideaway.
Russell was a paddock bookmaker until
recently ; he used to be in the Melbourne
office of the late E. N. Abrahams (“The
Count”). The chestnut son of Great Star
went out nearly as good a favorite as
Croscon. He had the race in his keeping
a long way from home and easily stalled
off a challenge from Sea Rover. Because
of being drawn wide out, Celotex was
scratched by F. H. Lewis, on the advice
of his brother Bob, the jockey. Celotex
is a rod in pickle for the Bagot Handicap
on New Year’s Day, if he does not win
at Caulfield in the meantime.
Spencer Brunton, of Sydney, annexed
the juvenile handicap with Quarto, and
may have been unlucky not to win the
Kiata Handicap as well with Mannana.
The latter, a smart filly by Manfred, had
a poor passage and was beaten by Air-
kloof and Heros in a tight finish. Polly
Speck, recently sold to a patron of the
stable of Frank Godby, carried that
trainer’s young son to victory in the
Argyle Highweight Handicap, for which
he was favorite.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
King Elliott is a better wrestler than
thunderbolt” Patterson, but is not in
the Thunderbolt’s class as a fighter. With
a body press and flying tackles he pinned
his man in the second round of their
affair at Leichhardt, but was felled with a
right uppercut and himself pinned in the
fourth. Flying tackles again had Patter-
son falling over himself in the fifth. But
one head dive hurt the bumper more than
the bumped, and Patterson flopped on
the lighter lad for the deciding fall.
Ins and Outs
McCabe is booked for an appendicitis
operation and will play in no more
Sheffield Shield matches this season. It
is expected he will be O.K. for the Eng-
lish tour, but Ma will miss him in Mel-
bourne and Adelaide, where the State
XI is now busy.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: The cables publish a
forecast of Marylebone’s reply to the
last ill-advised cable from the Board of
Control. The club is unlikely to give the
definite assurance that bodyline bowling
will be prohibited, as the board rather
impudently demanded, but it will refer
the Australian body to the resolutions re-
cently passed by the conference of county
captains to the effect that bowling of the
type was against the spirit of Cricket and
its employment should be frowned upon.
* * * •*
“Bramall Lane”: Some of the English
papers are getting ready to put the boot
into Bradman, who seems to have a dis-
turbing effect on them. Don recently
made some reference to money-making
from cricket, and London “Daily Mail”
comments that “coming from a supposed
amateur this isn’t so bad.” The paper
goes on to say that Bradman can thank
his stars he hasn’t the Marylebone club
to deal with and that no Englishman fol-
lowing in Don’s footsteps would get
nearer a team than the spectators’
benches. Yet there is hardly a so-called
amateur playing in England to-day who
does not, as county secretary or in some
other employment connected with the
game, make his livelihood out of cricket,
just as much as Bradman avowedly does.
* * * *
“Bertha Bashit”: Women cricketers in
Australia are at present plunged in a con-
troversy beside which the men’s bodyline
barge was a mere nothing. The question
is whether wicketkeeperinas should wear
a mask, as the baseball-catchers of both
sexes do, to preserve their features from
injury. With the men it is of slight
importance—indeed men ’keepers of
writer’s acquaintance would have their
looks improved by a bumping ball or two
on their dials —but with the girls it is
quite another story. The trouble has been
added to by the fact that South Australia
has adopted the mask and has announced
that its players will use it in the inter-
state tourney to be held in Sydney early
next year. Some of the other States, in-
cluding Ma, of course, say they will see
S.A. somewhere before they allow the
practice, and so the row is proceeding
briskly.
* * * . *
“Tenth Slip”: The most disturbing fea-
ture of first-class cricket this season has
been the fielding. The number of catches
dropped has been appalling, and this is
especially the case in the slips, where 90
per cent, of the chances are given. Not
for many years has Australia had such
a poor lot of slip-fielders. If the selec-
tors cannot remedy this serious fault by
the time the team leaves for England, the
tour promises to be a gloomy one.
* * * *
“Ibn el Issar”: Duleepsinhji, recovered
from his long illness and on the point of
taking up his departure for India, where
he intends to stay for good, has made a
remarkable attack on modern cricket-con-
trol methods. “The Tulip” insists color
prejudice handicapped him everywhere,
beginning at Cheltenham. There, though
an outstanding member of the school
eleven for some years, he was studiously
kept from the captaincy —about the high-
est athletic distinction an English P.S. boy
hopes to attain. Similarly at Cambridge
he soon found that his chance of ever
leading the Light Blues in cricket was one
with the immortal Buckley’s. He was
dropped from the Tests with South Africa
after the first match, as he avers, because
the Afrikanders took exception to him.
Strong attempts were later made to keep
him out of the games against the Aus-
tralians, but he fairly played his way into
these. It is a lengthy tale of woe which
suggests that Duleep has thus early de-
veloped an Indian liver. Time may heal
his wounds and brighten his outlook.
H: * * *
“Tommac”: “Fitzcray” (B. 29/11 /’33)
hasn’t a monopoly of the headaches in-
duced by cricket “experts” in the press
and over the air. Writer got one when he
read in a Sydney daily an ex-inter-
national’s post-mortem on the second
testimonial match. He agreed that Rowe,
of N.S.W., by his double batting success
had joined the left-handed aspirants for
the English tour, but added that Rowe
was “too young.” Memories of Trumper,
Hill, Bradman, McCabe and Archie Jack-
son should convince the dullest selector
that youth in cricket is not a crime.
* * * *
“How’s That”: Much has been written
of Larwood and bodyline. In the
’eighties England harbored a bowler
named W. E. W. Collins (Shropshire
and M.C.C.), who was a fast left-hander
with a high-kicking action. On one
occasion he disposed of four men with
one ball. The first (No. 9 on the list)
was hit on the thumb and had to retire.
The batsman at the other end fainted at
the sight of the blood and had to be car-
ried off. No. 10 declared emphatically
that he was d d if he was going in to
face such a “wildcat,” and so there was
no partner for the last man. Collins took
6 wickets for 35 runs for the M.C.C.
against the 1888 Australian XI.

Racquet: and Bawl
The alteration of dates for the second
tennis Test in Brisbane, which now
begins on December 21, has compelled a
revision of the matches and an altera-
tion of the doubles pairing. First day
matches will be: Moon v. Hughes,
McGrath v. Lee, Quist v. Wilde,
Hopman-Moon v. Perry-Lee. Second
day: Moon v. Wilde, McGrath v. Perry,
Hopman v. Lee, Quist-McGrath v.
Hughes-Wilde. Third day: Quist v.
Hughes, Hopman v. Perry, Hopman-
Moon v. Hughes-Wilde, Quist-McGrath
v. Perry-Lee.
* * * *
The Queensland tennis championships
saw Quist in marvellous form. Well
seconded by McGrath, he took the
doubles title, the pair beating Crawford
and E. F. Moon by three sets to one. In
the semi-final of the singles he qualified
to meet Crawford by outing Moon 9-11,
6-1, 6-2; 6-3.
* * * *
“Inky”: I have been interested in the
incursions on my profession of the ener-
getic and likeable F. J. Perry, star turn
of the English tennis team in Australia.
He is writing at great length for the
“S. M. Herald” and other newspapers,
and what his employers will do now
that he has sprained his right wrist —
which, presumably, is his write wrist —
I shudder to think. But I have just been
looking over the amended rules of golf
dealing with the amateur status issued
by St. Andrews last week. These dis-
tinctly state that any person doing cer-
tain things, among them being writing
or talking of golf for pay, ceases to be
an amateur. As my recollection serves,
the world’s, lawn tennis authorities, while
not actually banning the practice of writ-
ing for publication in the press by dis-
tinguished amateur players, recently
deprecated it very strongly. It would
do no harm to tennis if its controllers
came out into the open as St. Andrews
has done; it would clarify a tangled
situation, for Perry is far from being
the only prominent amateur cutting out
the professional journalist by adding
writing on tennis to his playing activities.

A RISK
Too Grave (o T ah&f
SICKNESS and accident are the thieves that may rob
you of your income and expose you and your family
to hardships.
They may never happen to you—or they may even
happen to-day.

Ins and Outs
“Five Ways”: Queensland, after flat-
tering its backers in the Sheffield match
with Victoria in Brisbane, did the usual
fade-out. Scoring 349 and getting rid of
Ponsford, Woodfull and O’Brien for 100
runs, Bananaland had a fighting chance.
After that villainous fielding gave the
remaining Victorian batsmen a feast of
runs. Darling, after several chances, went
at 188. Scaife and Barnett got 73 and
78 respectively, the innings ending at
542. The home side was then cleaned
up for 162 (Bensted 97) and Victoria won
by an innings and 31. Once more the
fielding throughout the match was ex-
ecrable.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Some of these Sydney ex-
pert press writers who handle cricket
should have their cylinders relined. One
of them, reporting the score of 533 n.o.
made in an Indian club tourney by one
Haviwallah, says pontifically that this
exceeds the English first-class cricket
record of 485 by A. E. Stoddart and
the 452 by Bradman in Sydney. Stod-
dart’s English score was made in a club
match, Hampstead v. Stoics. Even that
and the Indian record are bettered by
the Clifton schoolboy, Collins, who ran
up 628 n.o. Bradman’s score of 452 is
the highest yet hoisted in a first-class
game. Then comes Ponsford with 429
and Archie Maclaren with 424.
* * * *
“Shabash Wallah”: Many followers of
cricket have wondered at the refusal of
Indian cricketers of good standing to play
with Indian teams. Duleepsinhji, before
his illness, declined to play with his com-
patriots when they were last in Britain.
Similarly Pataudi has refused to take
part in matches against Jardine’s team
now in India. Both these men base their
attitude on the fact that they have played
for England. The Indian authorities have
taken the sensible line that, now India
has arrived at Test-match status, Indian
nationals should not be permitted to rep-
resent any other country than their native
land.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Cash Amateur”: When I wrote (B.
6/12/’33) that St. Andrews was lagging
behind the Americans in the matter of
including golfers who wrote and talked
on golf for pay in the professional ranks,
I was slightly out of turn. The day after
that appeared, St. A., which has been
sitting on the egg for a long time, came
out with new rules on the subject which
go a bit further than the Yankee ver-
sions. The change is comprised in Section
3 of a schedule defining those ineligible
to take part in amateur golfing competi-
tions. Sections 1 and 2 are familiar. No.
3 says that anyone allowing name and
photo, to be used in advertisements,
allowing name to be used as author of
books or articles on golf not actually
written by him, writing press accounts of
competitions in which he is playing if
journalism is not his normal avocation,
receiving gifts or price concessions for
golf equipment, or allowing his skill at
the game to be exploited in any other
way for purposes of gain cannot play as
an amateur in any competition.
Employees of golf-equipment suppliers,
and others playing in furtherance of
their employers’ business, also come
under the ban.
't* H 1
“D.D.”: The new St. Andrews defi-
nition of what constitutes professionalism
—or, at least, non-amateurism—in golf
will hit Australian player-writers in the
midriff. Few of these men have any
claim to be professional journalists. They
will now have to choose between drop-
ping a profitable sideline and becoming
inhabitants of a golfing No Man’s Land.
The St. Andrews definition does not actu-
ally declare a man taking money in this
way because of his golf a professional—
it says that he cannot show in amateur
contests. The professional players,
strongly organised in Australia and
jealous of their rights and privileges, are
not likely to allow these piebald players
to cut in with them.
* * * *
“Iconoclast”: Golf secretaries are
something like the augurs of classical
memory—knowing too much, as they do,
they grin furtively at each other when
they meet. Nevertheless they have
human attributes, and the fact was em-
phasised when the officials of most of
the Sydney clubs met at Pennant Hills on
Secretaries’ Day. Eighteen holes of
stroke handicap was won in the morning
by Colonel Logan, of Bonnie Doon, who
returned a net 67 with a 24 handicap.
The afternoon four-baller ended with R.
N. Reilly (Kogarah) and R. C. King
(Roseville) 7 up.
* * * *
“Hamilton”: One of Queensland’s
most interesting golf competitions is that
for the annual Caddies’ Cup. This year
it was won by H. Oberg, of Royal
Queensland, who thus made the tally of
R.Q. caddies successful in this event five
wins out of seven tries. The qualifying
stroke rounds at R.Q. saw Oberg lead
the field with 78. In the match play
at Yeerongpilly he finished a hard-fought
game with Wickings, of the local club, 2
up.
* * * *
“Susie Swattit”: The A.L.G.U. has
fixed the dates for the Australian
women’s golf championships for next
year. They will run from September 3
to 13 and the battleground will be the
Royal Sydney course at Rose Bay. The
“Buck up, Bill, th’ demons is 'ere.”
“Demons? Wot for ?”
“Ter trace th' bloke y’re supposed to be 'ittin'.”
Maorilanders, who wiped the Australians’
collective eye in the match at Melbourne
for the Tasman Cup earlier in the year,
are daring an Australian team to cross
the Tasman and battle for the trophy. If
the defi. is accepted, the tourney takes
place at Auckland on the Titirangi club’s
links.
Racquet and 3aw?
Last week-end the Australian tennis
heads decided to postpone the beginning
of the second Test match with England
at Brisbane from December 14 to 21.
They acted chiefly from a desire to give
Perry a chance to recover from a wrist
injury he sustained while playing at
Dubbo (N.S.W.). Queenslanders are
heartily in accord with the postponement.
¥ * * *
“Milton”: With Crawford out, the
ranking of the Australian tennis four in
Brisbane is Hopman, McGrath, Quist
and Moon. The doubles combinations
are McGrath-Quist and Hopman-Moon,
and the separating of Hopman and Quist,
who combined so superbly in the first
Test, has aroused criticism. All the same,
Moon, who has been playing great tennis
is the State championships, has proved
himself one of Australia’s finest doubles
players and has toured and played with
Hopman. The Americans here last year
considered the Queenslander one of the
best men in combined play they had seen
anywhere.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: Whether Austra-
lia will send a Davis Cup team abroad
next year is the chief topic of the
moment in tennis circles —the challenge
need no't be issued before January 31.
It may be said at once that it all de-
pends on Crawford’s state of health. If
his enforced spell * does him the good
expected and the quacks pass him as an
A class man, the challenge will be made
—otherwise, no. Supposing that he is
right for No. 1, Hopman is the inevit-
able choice for second singles player
and Crawford’s doubles partner. That
leaves McGrath, Quist and Turnbull to
fill the two remaining places. Quist
and Turnbull proved such a good
doubles pair abroad that it would seem
preference should go their way. Though
McGrath was a comparative failure over-
seas, there is no doubt about his ability.
Perhaps the selectors may see their way
to send five men away this time—it has
been done before.
“Lob”: N.S.W. dispatches a team of
girls to Maoriland this week: Mdlles.
Bickerton, Hall, Valkenburg and Dingle.
A long programme lies before them, but
they are a capable lot, and if the doubles
pairs shake together should come out of
the Shivery Isles with a winning record.
Car and Cycle
“Glenelg”: South Australia is being
raked for all the ancient internal-com-
bustion vehicles which have come to the
country since Adelaide was plotted by
Light. When the cobwebs have been
brushed off them and the parts that the
locust hath eaten have been replaced as
near as possible, they will take part in a
reliability contest this month. It is hoped
to make the Crocks’ Trial an annual
event.
* * * *
“Whizz”: Still more light-car records.
On Montlhery track the other day, a
750 c.c. four-cylinder supercharged M.G.
model cracked all records for its class by
covering a mile at 128.62 m.p.h., five
miles at 127.8 m.p.h., and 10 at 125.43
m.p.h. Denly, a contemporary of Eyston
in light-car driving, had the wheel. The
lap on this circuit is only a mile and a
half, and on the straight runs the little
car topped 130 m.p.h.
* * * *
“Formula”: Details of the recent
record for a Diesel-engined car by the
English driver Eyston at Brooklands —on
a two-way run he averaged 102.3 m.p.h.
—have some interest for motorists. The car
was a four-seater saloon and powered with
a six-cylinder A.E.C. oil engine of the sort
used in London ’buses; it was run for a
few laps to warm up and was then timed
over the -flying kilometre and the mile.
The engine is of considerable capacity—
about 9 litres—but it was found that at
100 m.p.h. the fuel consumption was
better than at 20. An electrical-heating
device enables the instantaneous start of
the engine when cold —often a trouble-
some job with a Diesel and, indeed, with
petrol-driven power units.
* * * *
“Hotham”: A Melbourne biking
flapper with the intriguing name of
Doreen Middleton has been wiped off
the amateur list. Doreen engaged in a
match which was timed by a professional.
This was regarded as the unforgiv-
able sin by the Brunswick club, and
retribution swiftly fell upon the lady.
Her attitude, and that is backed by many
who are learned in cycling lore and law, is
that only the Victorian Amateur Cyclists’
Union is qualified to deprive anyone of
his or her amateur status, so Brunswick
is to be brought to book.
Miscellaneous
“Six Beat”: The question of whether
Hawaiian swimmer Kalili would be
allowed to swim in the Australian cham-
pionships as a Queenslander (B.
29 /11 / ’33) has been settled by the Ama-
teur Swimming Union. He can swim,
but should he win a championship will
not be rated as an Australian titleholder,
as he retains his American citizenship.
Queensland will, therefore, score no
points for his wins, if any, though Kalili
himself will be given a duplicate medal.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: Curious that the many
obituary notices of C. D. Patterson,
founder of the Surf Life Saving
Association, omitted to mention that he
was an international Rugby player. He
was a forward in the British team of
1904, led by Bedell Sivwright, about the
best side from the Old Dart to visit these
shores. Others in that team who are still
remembered were Bush and Viles, the
famous pair who showed our men what
half-back combination c.ould be, and
Blair Swannell. Blair, like Patterson,
stayed in Australia, to die later on Gal-
lipoli, at the Landing.
* * * *
The annual Pittwater regatta to be
held on Dec. 30 will be the 27th, and a
band of enthusiasts, with Stuart Doyle as
president and Vernon Moor as secretary,
is working to make it the best. There
will be races for yachts, motor craft,
sailing and rowing boats, and the Gwydir
has been hired to take Sydney passengers
to Broken Bay.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: Paris is responsible for
a new idea for pacing pedestrians in
long-distance track races which, it is
hoped, will lead to the cracking of a
lot of standing records. It consists in
a spotlight thrown on the track which
is capable of being moved round the
course at any desired speed. The runner
is placed in the light for a start and is
expected to keep in it as its pace in-
creases. The difficulty of judging pace
is the trouble when human pacers are
used. The new invention can be regu-
lated to a nicety, and those watching the
run know to a split second how fast their
man is going and how much more he has
to crack on to set up new figures.

The Kangaroos had mixed luck in the
North of England last week. They won
26-4 from Rochdale, a Lancashire club,
but were beaten 17-16 by “Cumberland.”
The latter county boasts only one League
club, Barrow, christened after the town
of that name, which is really in Lanca-
shire. There were three men from this
club in the “county” side, four from
Swinton, two from Rochdale and one
each from Leeds, Salford, Hull and Old-
ham, the last six being Lancashire or
Yorkshire clubs.
* * * *
“Birkenhead Park”: English Rugby is
arguing with itself at the inclusion in the
trial match for the international games
this season of South African Owen Smith.
Smith is a representative S.A. cricketer,
and plays for Oxford. He is the out-
standing full-back in England to-day,
is of English descent, and is the
obvious choice for the England cap.
It is late in the day to object. In the
’Bo’s one Gregory Wade, later to be-
come Premier and C.J. of N.S.W., played
for Oxford and England. Later,
Sammy Woods figured for Cambridge
and England, and since then Australians
like Forsayth and Wallace and Maori-
lander Aitken have appeared for Oxford
and Scotland. In each case the national-
ity of the player’s parentage was the
deciding factor, and the fact that he was
born in a Dominion didn’t matter a
hoot.
* * * *
“Old ’Un”: There is a move in Parra-
matta to revive the Rugby Union
club which was once the pride of the
district. Parramatta club never won a
premiership, but contributed many fine
players, including the Wickhams, to inter-
state and Australian teams. It expired
with the entry of district football. Per-
haps the finest feather in the old club’s
cap was its 8-8 draw with the conquering
Queensland side of 1892, which won all
the other six matches of its programme,
including the double against N.S.W.
“Splash”: Two of Australia’s best
swimmerettes are in M.L.: Frances Bult
and Claire Dennis. Neither is finding
the opposition formidable. The M.L.
220 yards breast-stroke record is 3min.
27 3-ssec., and Claire Dennis has done
the distance in 3min. 9 l-ssec. Frances
Bult’s figures for the 100 dash are lmin.
2 3-ssec. —2sec. better than the M.L. best
by M. Farquhar.
* . * * *
“Shoot”: Something new in inter-
state athletic visits comes off in January
when N.S.W. is sending a team of surf-
ing life-savers to Perth to compete in
the carnivals there. Tests will be held
this month for the selection, and C. W.
Whitehead, chief instructor to the Life
Saving Association for the last five years,
will manage the team. Westralia has
given a solid guarantee towards expenses.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: Victorian oarsmen are
protesting against the decision of the Tas-
manian R.A. to hold the King’s Cup
inter-State race in May on the Lower
Derwent. The other mainland States
are to be asked to conduct a postal vote
on the subject. The wide estuary needs
very little wind to make a dangerous
lop get up, as those who saw the 1927
race on the same water will recall. Most
of the crews swamped, and there were
30-odd men in the water at one time,
though luckily there was no loss of life.
It is considered that the Upper Derwent,
where the 1910 race was rowed, or the
Tamar at Launceston, where the 1921
event took place, is far more suitable.
* * * *
“Cam”: There has been something of
a storm in a teacup over the decision of
Cambridge University to bar American
and overseas students from securing
blues. The ukase is not as stiff as it
looked at first advices, and, apparently,
only applies to those who do not com-
plete the full three years’ course. Men who
have gained athletic fame at an Ameri-
can foundation have gone into residence
at Cambridge for a year simply to get
the coveted blue, even to-day the highest
honor any amateur athlete can hope for.
Australian students, especially the row-
ing men, have helped Cambridge a lot
in the past, while what Oxford would
do in the world of athletics without the
Rhodes scholars the deuce only knows.
* * * *
“Third Base”: Latest news of the pro-
jected visit of American baseballers
indicates that manager Earl Mack will
bring two teams along, Australia being
the last stopping place on the way home
after Japan and Manila have been in-
vaded. The famous “Babe” Ruth, the
Bradman of baseball, is a certain tourist.
Brisbane and Sydney are already
marked down on the itinerary, and Mel-
bourne is asking that the tour be ex-
tended to permit the players showing in
the centenary celebrations. Extension is
hardly likely, for the players have to be
back in the States for the opening of
their o\yn season in May.

Some of the time, if not all the time, you must save money, but
if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all the time is nearer
the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one week’s salary, it won’t provide
for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO. No one week’s
salary will provide education for your children, heavy medical
expenses, or comfort in your declining years.
Therefore, to make provision for the big calls, you have to save,
more or less, all the time.

WALNUT-STAIN
A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney may not have had a Lord
Mayor’s wedding last week, but she had
a queen bee’s. On a hot, still morn-
ing from dizzyingly high in the blue a
cloud of bees descended into King-street.
Evidently the queen bee was one of those
royalties who demand the blessing of
both Church and State, for, after hover-
ing coyly above St. James’s, she swept
down before the Supreme Court, and she
and her followers made entry into a
pillar-box just outside. The steps of
the Supreme Court were, in an instant,
swarming with humans; so were the
King-street pavements and the Elizabeth-
street corners. A woman with a fresh
face remarked to a neighbor: “I come
from Camden way: I don’t think they’re
my bees following me ; still you can’t be
sure when they aren’t branded.” Then
she moved on, leaving a city woman
gasping.
The lifts of the St. James building car-
ried a freight of dazzle to the Forum
Club doors the other night when the Eng-
lish-Speaking Unionists foregathered for
their Merry Christmas party. Every other
year the E.S.U., in marking the end of
the year’s calendar, has torn asunder the
wishbone of the sacrificial fowl, but this
year it feasted on music. That it was
the season of “The Messiah” was not
overlooked in the programme arranged by
pianist Mrs. Twigden and Mrs. Wallace
Turner, and the first number poured out
in Kitty Glover’s rich contralto was “O
Thou That Tellest Good Tidings.” Elsie
Findlay lifted up a fine clear soprano,
Dan Scully’s violin sang hauntingly, Law-
rence Campbell told of Christmas Bells to
a gilded audience that was crusted with
vice-royalty. Both Sir Philip and Lady
Game were there, her pink chenille em-
bossed chiffons keeping company with a
sheaf of dignified gladioli.
For some months past there has been
a suburban drive in aid of the Far West
children. Ten of Sydney’s best suburbs
rolled up their sleeves, and the result
was a total of £904. This was passed
over to Lady Game at the great cash-
and-carry meeting (it took the form of
a luncheon) at the Arts Club, and North
Shore-liners tried not to look too com-
placent when the Wahroonga amount of
£237 and Killara’s £l7O were announced.
The roll-up to the meeting was a record,
and there was great applause when the
Governor’s lady declared it was her own
and Sir Philip’s hope to see the founda-
tion-stone of the new building laid before
they left the State. The Governor told
of the interest taken in the scheme out
west, where he himself had just been
seeing the business end of it. He had
talked to Sister Brookes for an hour at
Bourke when the travelling baby clinic
was alongside his railway carriage, and
now felt that he would make a “very
passable mother himself.” This was the
best line in the play and brought down
the house.
Bernard Heinze, of Melbourne, has a
way with kiddies. Thousands of en-
thralled schoolchildren listened to him
at the two orchestral matinees last week.
First he told them the names and uses
of the various instruments and had the
musicians play passages on each. But it
was at the second concert he showed him-
self the wonderful conductor he is. He
decided to lead the seething mass of
youth in song; so he started in with
“Advance, Australia Fair,” and followed
it with “Men of Harlech.” The girls
and boys from a dozen or more different
schools, without any rehearsing, stood up
and, led by that magic baton, sang the
numbers —finely-shaded and not a beat
out! Schoolmarms and -masters in
charge of their flocks are still breathing
amazement.
The art show presented at 309 George-
street by the A. J. Browns is as uncon-
ventional as were Albert Collins’s open-
ing remarks. In addition to the water-
colors and pastels on the walls, the room
is ornamented with miniature gardens in
the Japanese and Chinese manner, and
with examples of embroideries and quilt-
ings. The gardens and the needlecraft are
contributed to the exhibition by Mrs.
Brown, who is also responsible for many
of the landscapes and architectural
themes on the walls. The fact that both
husband and wife tackle the same
sorts of subjects in their painting adds
interest to the journey around the pic-
tures, which are glimpses of Australian
and Maoriland scenery and fascinating
examples of the famed in stone of Eng-
land and Europe. Mr. Brown, who is
known to Sydney as an artist and a town-
planner, is a native of Enzed.
One of the prettiest things possible to
hear on a sunny wind-blown afternoon
was the singing of a poem by the chil-
dren of Dalwood ; it was written for them
by Le Gay Brereton and is sung to the
music of “Drink to Me Only with Thine
Eyes.” Robert Louis Stevenson might
have been proud to put it in his “Child’s
Garden of Verse.” Little girls with
gleaming hair and snowy pinafores and
small boys with faces shining with soap
and goodwill sang it cheerfully and with-
out awe for Lady Game and a great
tentful of men and women friends of
the home, who had motored from town
to the annual meeting. The usual “A-ah! ”
of admiration was evoked by the dining-
room with its tiny chairs and tables and
its wallpaper, whereon snowmen, ele-
phants, men skating, reindeers and little
fir-trees foregather in the most friendly
manner.
Here is an up-to-the-minute photograph
of William Morris Hughes’s Helen.
Helen, an already much-travelled lady,
caught the eye of no less a person than
Laszlo on her last visit to Europe—that
painter of beautiful women saw in the
blonde daughter of Australia’s ex-Prime
Minister the Botticelli type. The Sydney
girl was one of the bridesmaids in the
Lord Mayor’s wedding pageant in Mel-
bourne last week. Photo, from Dorothy
Welding.
Ernest Watt’s old home, Araluen, went
gay last week, and the ballroom in the
garden (in daytime, now, a schoolroom)
and a marquee with a specially-sprung
dancing floor were crowded with dancers
—mostly teen-old girls, partnered by
sprigs of the Navy and Sydney’s elegible
bachelors under 30. The girls, who are
receiving or have just received their final
polish at Doone, were giving a dance to
mark the end of the school year. There
were no wallflowers, there being a sur-
plus of ten able-bodied men. The recep-
tion-rooms blazed with tall spears of
gladioli; the two dining-rooms were used
for supper and were twined about with
pink radiance roses. Incidentally, all the
supper was home-made, the hostesses
having prepared the savories and made
the cakes. Principal Jean Cheriton wore
lobelia-blue velvets sprayed with silver ;
Mrs. Ernest Watt brought beflowered
chiffons. From South Aus. Government
House came Rosemary Fleischmann in
lustrous white satin ; our own vice-regal
establishment sent its two sons, David
and Philip, and Charles Gifford, A.D.C.
The Bulletin camera caught Louise
Lightfoot in between rehearsals of
“Autumn Leaves,” the only ballet in-
vented by Anna Pavlova, and “The Ball,”
set to the music of Carl von Weber. Louise,
with Misha Burlakov, directs the group
known as the First Australia Ballet. But
this little band does not limit itself to
the classic ballet; it demonstrates the
plastic beauty of the German school.
Another starry number of its Conserva-
torium programme next Saturday will be
the Indian ballet, “Krishna and Rhada,”
which was one of the hits in the recent
Empire pageant.
.Harold Carter, a son of artist Norman,
has bagged a unique job—that of travel-
ling veterinary doctor to Australian
Estates and Mortgages. Harold is a
graduate of Sydney Uni.
Robert Kaleski is walking about with
the pleased smile of one who finds the
general public eager to pay 3s. 6d. a copy
to read his pet theories. The En-
deavour Press republished Mr. Kaleski’s
“Barkers and Biters”; the book has
romped almost through a first edition,
and the author is still being warmly
praised by such publications as the
“American Kennel Gazette.” Robert may
be termed a freelance research scientist,
and out at his home, Thorn Hill, many
interesting experiments are in progress.
One discovery he is working on will, if
carried to a successful issue, be named
Lordene, after Professor Lord of Syd-
ney Tech., for whom Mr. Kaleski did
field experiments for many years.
One of Australia’s most devoted lovers
of art is Howard Hinton. He attends
exhibitions regularly and is one of the
most generous buyers. He has none of
the jealous instincts of the ordinary col-
lector, for he has already given 120 oil-
paintings and water-colors to the
National Art Gallery. Lately he has
turned his attention to the north of the
State, and has been sending splendid
gifts to the Teachers’ College at Armi-
dale. The walls of the college are now
enriched with 80 paintings from his col-
lection —Streetons, Heysens, Griiners,
Longs, Hilders, and the works of many
more Australian, English and French
artists.
Scots College is out after a new school
hall, and on Saturday afternoon the
parents and friends of the school, the
lads themselves and the staff produced
a fete that brought the currency of Belle-
vue Hill rolling through its gates. The
stalls were arranged about the playing
fields, and Christmas gifts for father
could be bought at the tobacco and
cigarette stall, and for little sister at the
dolls’ house. Everybody was too excited
to notice the grey sky and the spatter
of rain early in the afternoon, and even
the greyness could not altogether detract
from the view of the yacht-crowded
harbor. The sentiment of Scots was ex-
pressed by the group of students in
Highland costume who swung on to
the ground led by the Pipe Band. Organ-
iser Cooper Vines led forward Mackay
Sim to open the fete ; headmaster Bee
and Alan Clunies Ross were other
speakers.
At an exhibition of modern rooms in
London a few weeks ago the furniture
of the most important bedroom was in
Australian walnut, and it won all hearts.
As one admirer put it, it is “a wood to
conjure with, with its parallel markings.”
About-to-be-marrieds, too, eyed dining-
room tables in the same wood with a
look that plainly conveyed them to the
new home in Mayfair, Golders Green or
Hampstead.
Sydney still remembers the dewy com-
plexion and the golden head of Pamela
Watt, a daughter of the well-known
Ernest and his first wife ; so there was
quite a gathering to drink her health and
that of her bridegroom the other day.
To synchronise as nearly as possible with
his daughter’s wedding in London, Mr.
Watt gave a cocktail party, and at the
Point Piper address Osbornes, Dangars,
Merivales, Allens, Levys and Gordon
Bradys toasted the happy pair. Holy
Trinity Church, Brompton-square, was the
scene of the wedding ; 3 Trevallyn Gate,
the home of Sir William Leeds, saw the
reception. The ’groom was Richard N.
Pedder, of the Highland Light Infantry—
a crack fighting regiment. His father is
Brigadier-General Pedder, formerly of
the 13th Hussars. The Gold Coast, West
Africa, is the young man’s present station.
The Rev. James McLeod, the new
minister of St. Stephen’s Church, Sydney,
who will arrive with his young daughter
on Wednesday next from Petty, Inverness-
shire, will be the guest of Dr. and Mrs.
George Armstrong at Quiraing, Tre-
lawney-street, Woollahra, until he finds a
house.
Still another queen has been added to
Sydney’s list of royalties. She is the
speedboat queen, and she provided a
flurry of excitement on Port Jackson last
Saturday. Motor yachts frothed through
the foam of Rose Bay, and finally the
Kookaburra wrested the crown for New-
town’s candidate. A laurel wreath, meant
for her brow and dropped from one of
three hovering aeroplanes, splashed into
the water, but that didn’t matter because
she was crowned all over again at the
dance in the evening at the clubhouse.
A silver rose bowl, an open order for £5O
and a fortnight at the Barrier Reef were
guerdons of office. There were silver
caskets for the runners-up, and silver
trophies for the speedboats that carried
them. The water tourney raised £l2OO
for the Benevolent Society.
First among the Anzac Festival Com-
mittee’s competition for 1934 is a musical
setting of the poem “The Rising Sun,”
by Mr. W. L. Williams, of Ararat, Vic-
toria, which won the recent competition
for a poem. This contest closes on
January 10, 1934. The second is a little
Pilgrim Theatre play embodying the
spirit of Anzac Day, suitable for per-
formance on a caravan with a properly
fitted stage and curtain, which should
last about 20 minutes. The third is a
design for a colored poster, 11 in. by
15in., to advertise the annual Anzac Eve
Festival Performance.

Chatter
The nine-days’ wonder is over. Cynthia
Brookes that was is now Mrs. Gengoult
Smith, the Lord Mayor’s bride. Bell-
toppers have been returned to their
rightful owners and morning suits are
once more hidden in cubby-holes re-
served for “gentlemen” at the back of
the Three Balls. Of the blaze of glory
there is little left but memories and 1000
sprays of myrtle, with “Gengoult” and
“Cynthia” written upon the binding
ribbons.
The size of Melbourne’s leisured class
is amazing, judging by the tightly-jammed
crowds who stood for hours in the neigh-
borhood of St. Paul’s. They even trekked
out to the Brookes front gate long after
the ceremony and reception—the bride’s
family sent them out bits of wedding
food. Wedding guests who set forth for
the cathedral in anything but taxis, or
chauffeur-driven cars had to fight every
inch of the way. Passage from St. Paul’s
to the Town Hall was easier. It was per
hoof and especially exhilarating for those
guests whose raiment met with the multi-
tude’s approval.
The civic fathers made a valiant
effort foi; the reception. The hydrangeas
were heavenly, and there was enough real
champagne to go round, particularly at
tables with an above-average quota of
tea-totallers. The tall and elegant cake
was not managed so happily, for several
hundreds didn’t get a nibble, much less
anything to sleep on. The presents were
all on view. Grandmamma Emmer-
ton’s cheque reached a satisfactory num-
ber of thousands.
Entrants to the Artists’ Ball had to
submit some part of their person to a
rubber stamp ; a sort of pass-out chit to
guard against gate-crashers. The revel
gathered momentum at a breakneck
pace. By midnight there was much dust
about, through playing bears, and throats
were hoarse with such “jolly good
companee.” Saucy chalk cartoons and
caricatures of Art Gallery exhibits blotted
out the walls above a border of beetles
and daisies. One of Max Meldrum’s pic-
tures was represented by a dab of white
upon a large black ground.
A Papuan warrior was leaps ahead
for the best costume. The Bill Mclnnes
couple sat and looked on ; no one knew
if they enjoyed the party, for he was
hidden behind a pig’s mask (made of
Jaeger) and she camouflaged her expres-
sion with the visage of a red-nosed clown.
Harry McClelland and a McTavish made
a Scottish invasion. They were counted
out, but it seemed their lungs had to let
off steam; even the band mopped its
forehead and took a rest while pipes
skirled. A few McCubbins were there,
the Len McClintocks, he all ready for
bed in pyjamas, and John Vickery, show-
ing a muscular knee in shorts. Phyllis
Cannon conceded a feather headdress to
her evening gown. The clever Atyeo lad
was in gingham. One man wore his
upper half in evening dress and the rest
in flappy shirt-tails. Harry Fern secre-
taried in a red sash to match his hectic
cheekbones.
Pineapples and lighted candles in
bottles decorated the supper tables. The
bright young things hung cherries on
their ears, while they pulled lobsters
limb from limb, cracked nuts and demol-
ished strawberries and cream and much
beer. There were corpses about in the
dawn, but all the most respectable people
went home for lunch.
The Chancellor has spoken, and there’s
to be no more strong drink at Uni.
dances. Beef tea and claret cup must
provide sufficient stimulation to carry
the gay undergrads, into the wee sma’
hours. Alcohol to be admitted legally
must have one of the labs, for its destina-
tion. Students predict a busy time for
enforcers of the law, for when a thing
is forbidden it becomes doubly attractive.
John MacFarland justifies his decision
on the behavior of people “who can’t
carry their liquor.”
Arrayed in chiffon over magnolia-
tinted satin Joyce Turner entered the
portals of St. John’s, Toorak, to emerge
the wife of Lindsay George Biggins. A
tulle veil swept the wedding robe with
its elongation of train. Snowy gardenias
were clasped in the bride’s fingers, which
crept out of long moulded sleeves. Olive
Rosenthal held lily-of-the-valley to help
her through the job of attendant ’maid.
She wore a frou-frou of white organdie
and a wide expanse of picture hat. Roy
Shepherd supported the ’groom. For the
after-rejoicings the Edmund Shepherds
offered their home at Armadale, whither
the bride’s parents invited a handful of
friends and relatives. The Strathnaver
and Colombo have been chosen for the
’moon.
With a diamond in his pocket Hamish
Macdonald paced the wharf at Port Mel-
bourne when the Oronsay was due to
nose her way through the misty dawn.
He was one of the first to leap up the
gangway, and returned later at a more
sedate pace with the Oswald Symes and
daughter Nancy. Nancy wears the
diamond.
Dame Clara’s third concert sustained
an overflow. The middle seats in the lee
of the organ were reserved by a choir,
clad all in white. Some chatterers
didn’t realise until prodded in the backs
by irate organ enthusiasts that Leslie
Curnow’s opening number was a solo,
not just come-in music. The Dame,
gracious as always, scintillated in gold
lame. But for lone spots of French
and Italian and her favorite Latin verse
“Panis Angelicus” her programme was
all English.
Marie Fogarty, of Camberwell, has left
with trunks of trousseau and wedding
presents to try her hand at housekeep-
ing in New Guinea. ’Groom-to-be Cyril
Parer awaits his bride in the rugged
jungly mountains, a few days’ hike or an
hour’s fly from Wau. Future mother-in-
law Mrs. John Parer is keeping Marie
company on her journey.
General Wisdom and Papua’s anthro-
pologist E. W. P. Chinnery have put
their heads together and decided to en-
lighten the inhabitants of Melbourne
about the country back of the Bulolo
goldfields. If you are a scientist, if the
dark unknown attracts you, or if you’re
just a girl interested in Man (the gold-
fields abound with him) come to the
Kelvin Hall on the 19th. Miss Byron
Moore, hearing the plot was in the wind,
begged the proceeds towards her pet
Travellers’ Aid Society, and her request
was granted.
Materials were used lavishly in creat-
ing robes for the leading ladies of the
Smith-Brookes wedding. Yards and
yards of rose point lace were unpicked
from the gown worn by the bride’s
mother at her wedding and nipped on to
the bridal satins and 12 feet of train.
The lace veil, too, was of sweeping
dimensions. Each ’maid had 60 yards of
tulle in her bubble of a trock. Frills
and yet more frills invaded the floor in
the wake of each pair of spindly heels,
and a fly-away layer of tulle made a brim
for little pill-box hats. Sandwiched in
this par. is a Broothorn portrait of
Hersey, youngest daughter of Norman
Brookes, who was one of the dozen
attendants.
Pomp and circumstance enveloped the
crowning finale of the Queen Carnival
competition. Added to the pageantry
was the thrill of anticipation. Little
prickles of nervousness ran up and down
regal spines, for even the queens them-
selves didn’t know which of them would
have a crown resting on her head. Under
a spotlight danced a nymph in pink tulle ;
thence emerged the Chancellor, equerries
and trumpeters, and it was divulged that
Betty Smith, of the Children’s Hospital,
had topped the list with £7700 worth of
votes. Little lame Betty has been a
patient in this hospital for two years.
She and her boy and girl retainers wore
the grey slacks and red jackets of con-
valescent youngsters and gleefully waved
miniature flags in lieu of bouquets.
Throats were hoarse with cheering Betty’s
success. Runner-up Mrs. Len Buxton, of
St. Vincent’s, was gorgeous in white
satin, with the scintillation of long ear-
rings and the sweep of a feather fan.
Her maids of honor made a rainbow of
pastel tonings. The Queen Victoria’s
Elaine Brookes had herself and her
retinue in diverse shades of green. The
Fairbairn lady, of the Alfred, managed
her scarlet train with dignity, while her
attendants clutched deep red roses against
their green frocks.
Gladys Moncrieff, who stood for the
Women’s Hospital, was speechless with
excitement at young Betty’s victory. She
dropped the lily-of-the-valley which went
so well with her ivory satin and ermine.
Mrs. Tutton, Bebe Scott, and Pat
McLean, representing the Homoeopathic,
the After Care and the Eye and Ear,
helped to raise the harvest into the region
of £32,000.
This is Betty Bunting, another ’maid
who figured at Melbourne’s most enor-
mous wedding. Betty is the daughter of
the A. H. Buntings and has an address
in Samarai, Papua, and another in Syd-
ney. She is an old girl of The Hermi-
tage, Geelong. Portrait by Broothorn.
A breath of bushland has blown this
week through No. 9. In the genteel ball-
room gumnuts, woody bits of swamp-
cyprus and all sorts of queer seed-cases
decorate baskets of reeds, bark and
rushes. The tiniest basket will keep your
thimble ever handy and the largest took
a baby to America last week —this last
had a sort of collapsible outrigger for
holding a mosquito-net aloft. There are
mats in all sizes ; attractive are those
of plaited bark, and most alluring in tint
and texture the hookwork ones made
from rags and wool. All exhibits are
made by incapacitated men and women,
with Mrs. Henrietta Walker as an en-
couraging demonstrator. She does all
the dyeing and much of the intricate
finishing-off, and even grows the raw
material —for practically all of it comes
from the Walker property at Ringwood.
Sales profits go to needy cases.
Cupid tipped his arrows with a quick-
working love potion when he shot
darts at Gladys Godden and Cap-
tain James Bundred. Diamonds sparkled
after a ten days’ acquaintance, and a
wedding-ring sealed the compact a month
later. The bride eschewed conventional
garb. But for the brown of her velvet
toque, shoes and gloves, she was all
moonstone-blue. Marie Tait ’maided in
floral georgette. After Christmas the
bridal sloop will cleave the waters of the
Pacific for the bridegroom’s home in
Hong Kong.
At the nuptials of Ann Catherine Cum-
ing and Kingsley Osborne Atkins, Bishop
Hart, of Wangaratta, and the Rev.
Hubert Brooksbank, both uncles of the
’groom, made fast the marriage knot.
The bride’s uncle escorted her to the
altar of Melbourne Grammar School
chapel. Deep cream satin fashioned the
wedding gown with its high pearl-strewn
neckline and tight sleeves. More pearls
were sewn to a panel in the skirt, and
a tulle veil filmed over a petalled train.
Freda Parker’s ’maid frock of duck-egg
green swished with frills into a train.
She carried water-lilies, and bound her
hair with pinky blossoms. The rejoic-
ings were at Grosvenor.
Mothers, unpacking knapsacks of off-
spring who jamboreed abroad with the
Boy Scouts, are looking in vain for their
lads’ original possessions. In Hungary
boys of every nation had an orgy
of swapping. Clothes and knick-knacks
changed hands many times. First favor-
ites were postcards, stamps, watches,
musical boxes and Tartar knives. One
boy developed a passion for handker-
chiefs and brought back an enormous
collection.
Perth’s budget of pleasant occasions:
A zephyr fanned airy fal-de-lals at the
W.A.T.C. meeting where a summer sun
called forth forerunners of Cup frocks with a
riot of color in the flowerbeds as appropriate
setting. Mrs. McKenzie Grant, from the nor’-
west, picked favorites in black matelasse with
white-lacquered organdie flowers perched on her
black Baku headgear; Neva Hocking and Mrs.
Dave Dvoretsky were two who looked natty
in brown and white checks and accessories; the
Moulden lady from Adelaide shaded sherry
ribouldingue with cream ballibuntal; Bess
Edwards, ideal of the fashion photographers,
was shoe-horned into duck-egg blue flamisol
with an organdie-bowed wide racello straw re-
vealing her chin and one nostril; May Oakley
was demurely attractive in Vesuvius-pink maro-
cain with snowy shirt waist.
His Ex. launched the Y.A.L. garden fete
for a four-day cruise at Government House.
E. R. Marie was at the helm, and a large crew
of workers did overtime to make a successful
sailing. Praise went to Mrs. R. Goyne Miller’s
production of “The Evolution of Milady’s
Dress,” with Betty Hayward as the Spirit of
Fashion, and Berna Streeter’s arrangement of
“Fashion Cocktails of 1934.” Mrs. W. H.
Taylor trained a bevy of belles to mannequin
both shows, which were presented in the ball-
room.
To provide bricks and mortar for the Angli-
can church at Nedlands, the J. O. Fisher family
cast nets over bridge players and drew them
to their South Perth home. Mrs. Fisher’s regal
purple lace was flanked by Kathleen’s harebell
taffetas and Faith’s mimosa-green Chantilly.
Before the cards there was a tour of the grounds
and building under the guidance of the son
and heir, who designed the Gothic additions
to the original structure.
Betty Drake-Brockman made an early start
on an eventful day by blowing out 21 candles
at a morning tea-party, where Mrs. Drake-
Brockman looked more like an elder sister in
cream and brown wide-checked craquelle. Betty
cut the cake in butcher-blue linen with win-
dowed back and a crushed fez in natural toned
macrame string.
Some years ago the Craven family inherited
estates in England, and with them the name of
Craven-Smith-Milnes-Pegge-Burnell. Realisation
for probate necessitated the sale of certain pro-
perties, and with the reduction of holdings a
request was made to the King to allow a reduc-
tion of names. Now Madame and daughter
Mary have returned to Perth as Craven-Smith-
Milnes, with son Assheton retaining the Pegge-
Burnell.
Charles McAllen directed and played lead in
the Amateur Movie Club’s presentation of “Fair
Game” in National Chambers. Farm scenes
at Korrelocking backgrounded heroine Lorna
Taylor, sticking valiantly to a bolting horse;
King’s Park was the venue for also-ran-suitor
Stanley Howe to stage a hold-up, and St.
George’s Cathedral saw the happy-ever-after
finale. Robert Thain and Archibald Lightbody
did the photography.
The founders of the French Salon draped
the winter garden of the Karrakatta Club with
French, English and Australian flags, deposited
gladioli and carnations in chosen spots, and
dished out tea to the members. Mrs. Cecil
Mason was galah-like in soft pink sand crepe
inlet with grey georgette, and Miss Skinner
flaunted flamingo flamisol with oatmeal peda-
line headpiece.
The Strathaird brought back knight Talbot
Hobbs and his lady with their two daughters
Nancy and Betty, who for the past year have
been touring England and the Continong.
Adelaide’s social doings:
The A.T.C. meeting at Cheltenham fell on
a sunny day. Jack Morish and his wife enter-
tained at afternoon tea, and there was .such
a crowd that an extra room had to be brought
into use. Mrs. Morish wore a modish black
frock, with a black satin cape and a small black
hat. Black and white predominated in the
frocking.
A gift garden party at Rostrevor College was
a gay affair. Stalls were arranged about the
fine old garden, and tea Was served under gay
teach umbrellas.
Mrs. J. T. Gordon gave an afternoon party
at her residence, Medindie, for Mrs. Kenneth
Milne and the Misses Darling, who have just
returned from England. Delphiniums and
gladioli in huge brass bowls decorated the
rooms. The hostess wore white-and-green
figured crepe de Chine and a wide-brimmed
hat. About 40 guests were present,
Katherine Rymill gave a party at the Picca-
dilly for AHeyne Downer, whose engagement
to Katherine’s brother, Henry Rymill, was re-
cently announced. The hostess wore beige
crepe and a brown straw hat. Miss Downer
was in oink sand crepe with a natural straw
hat. Gladioli in two shades and delphiniums
supplied the decorations.
The Uni. Staff Wives’ Club, with Mrs. Harvey
Johnston, president, in the chair, served lunch
in the refectory as a farewell to Mrs. J. A.
Prescott and Mrs. Geoff Samuel on the eve
of their departure for England. Afterwards
officers for the ensuing year were elected, Mrs.
A V E Richardson being chosen as president.
L. T. Ewens, captain of the Uni. cricket and
lacrosse teams, was guest of honor at a lunch
it< the refectory prior to his departure for
M L , where he is to marry Peggy, daughter of
Prof and Mrs. Bernard Dawson, of Dunedin.
The M LC. Old Scholars’ Association gave
a farewell tea-party at the Piccadilly for the
principal, Miss Ashworth, who goes to M.L.
as head of a girls’ college. The new principal
is a man. ~ , , , . c
The marriage of Peggy, eldest daughter of
Mr and Mrs. Charles Morgan, of our Toorak,
to John Paulin, of Sydney, was celebrated at
St Matthew’s, Marryatville. Mr. and Miss
T K. Paulin, the bridegroom’s parents, came
from Sydney.

From a Sheepman’s Diary.
BY “JUMBUCK.”
ATURDAY, Aug. 26— 1 intended
to go over all the paddocks to-day,
but didn’t go very far ; they made
me feel wretched. I started on the red
rise at the back of the woolshed, where
there was a fair spring of grass from
the inch we had eight weeks ago. It
was withered and brown from frosts
and lack of rain. It hasn’t much chance
of recovery, apart from a miracle or a
couple of inches within the next week or
so, and even with that it is doubtful;
it seems too far gone.
The grass that shot after the afore-
said rain made fair growth for a week
or two, and then stood still. It is thick
enough, but so short that it cannot be
much good for the sheep, as they can
scarcely even nibble it; and it is so dried
up that even to their starved stomachs
it cannot be very appetising.
It is remarkable how strong the sheep
are, though. I was lucky to have shorn
them in fine weather. Had there been a
cold snap during shearing or within a
day or two afterwards many of them
would have died.
After I had been out an hour I went
home. I should have strained up the
wire in the fence in the home paddock,
but I simply couldn’t be bothered. What’s
the use? Another fortnight of the dry
weather and the grass will have gone.
After that the sheep will peg out gradu-
ally, and after that the mortgagee will
step in. Last year I paid him nearly
four hundred pounds in interest, selling
the last realisable thing to do it, and
raising as big a loan as I could get from
my wool firm on a stock mortgage. This
year I ducked under the Moratorium Act
and let him whistle. He nearly blew his
front teeth out and then started shouting
in my ear. I let him shout.
Took stock after tea to-night. I have
fifteen hundred ewes and about nine hun-
dred lambs. I got only 39 bales off the
ewes, worth, say, £ll a bale—£429 less
freight, brokerage, warehousing, shear-
ing and the rest. Their value is five bob
a head, or less ; say, £3OO after paying
commission. The lambs are strong
enough, but only in fair order ; put them
down at £2OO. That makes £9OO, and I
owe my wool firm that much on them;
after I have sold my wool and stock I
shall have nothing. If I can’t sell them
(buyers are scarce) and they die I will
owe the brokers £5OO. I owe the store-
keeper £3OO, and I owe £4OO in various
ways—rates and so on.
After I had gone over my position for
a while my mind was a maze of figures,
so I turned it in. At ten o’clock or so
a voice issuing from the loudspeaker of
my three-valver prophesied rain. I
wonder how many men on the land have
taken the axe to their wireless sets on
account of those stupid, fruitless pro-
phecies we endure so often.
Sunday, Aug. 27. —Jim Brock came
over this morning. He says he is going
to handfeed his sheep. I advised him not
to. You feed them for months, and do
all your cash ; and as soon as you stop
they die like flies. When they’re all dead
it rains, and you have to stock up at
high prices, and borrow to do it because
your cash is all gone. I know ; I did it
twice. I advised Jim to yard every hoof
on the place and cut the throats of the
weak and the old. It hurts like hell to
do it, but it is much more humane than
letting them die of hunger, and it gives
the remainder a chance to pull through.
I’m going to do it myself unless it rains
during the next fortnight—and it won’t.
Why kid yourself that it will?
The wife has gone off with Mrs. Brock
in the gig to the Presbyterian church,
which is having special prayers for rain.
I asked her to put in a word for the wool
sales, which open in Sydney to-morrow.
It is a clear, cloudless, still night, and
there will be a heavy frost, which will
play havoc with the grass and the
stock.
Jim Brock says the best thing we can
all do is walk off our properties. I asked
him where we would walk to? This is
my home, and a shelter for my wife and
the children. 1 will leave it when I am
thrown out; not before.
Monday, Aug. 28.—’ This has been an
amazing day. It opened with a very
heavy frost, and the grass was obviously
browner when it cleared off, about ten
o’clock. I found a sheep lying against
the house-paddock fence with her head
tucked into her side and apparently
asleep. She was dead and cold; the
frost had killed her. Just skin and bone,
I and she couldn’t stand up to it. It was
a sunny, still morning, but late in the
afternoon a dark-blue, almost purple,
bank of clouds came up on the north of
the horizon. They promised rain, but I
took little interest in them, because I
have been disappointed so many times.
At tea I looked out the window to see
a fine rain falling. “It’ll stop soon,” I
thought; but it didn’t. In an hour it had
set in properly. There was a glorious,
heavy drumming on the roof. The wife
and I sat up until midnight listening to
it and enjoying it. We were so excited
that we forgot to tune in to hear the
wool sales ; but we got them from a
“B”-class station later in the evening.
Fifty per cent, rise on last year’s prices!
It’s grand. Certainly, prices are still too
low, but they’re heading in the right
direction.
What with the very welcome and long
overdue rain and the rise in wool it has
been a wonderful night. It is rather
like putting your sole remaining pound
on a hundred-to-one shot and seeing him
pip off the favorite in the last stride. And
this morning I would have said it was
just as likely.
The rise means another £2OO for the
wool, and if this rain is followed up
stock should be worth much more; but
I won’t bank on anything just yet.
Tuesday, Aug. 29. —Awakened to find
water lying everywhere. I thought there
had been an inch and a half; the rain
guage said 160 points. I have been walk-
ing on air all day. It was far too muddy
to go around the sheep ; the ground is
like half-set glue, and after a dozen
yards you have a dozen pounds on each
foot.
The party line has been busy this
morning. Everybody has been chuckling
and exclaiming about the rain and the
rise in wool. There are five on my line,
and we have all had a yarn with each
other. Sometimes we all talked together
as excitedly as a lot of kids at a picnic.
I believe adults are all kids at heart.
A still, sunny day and wonderful
growing weather. If the rain is only fol-
lowed up and if wool prices hold or rise,
we will see a way out of the wood
yet.
Wednesday, Aug. 30. —Another lovely
day. The grass is not only greener but
growing. Remarkable how well it has
responded; and I had thought it was
beyond aid. Fat sheep jumped three or
four bob a head at Newmarket yesterday,
according to the wireless. I don’t care
how high they jump. Went around the
sheep and found about twenty dead ; not
as bad as I had feared.
Thursday, Aug. 31. —Don’t feel much
like writing to-night. I walked a good
few miles yesterday and to-day, and am
tired out. Glorious day, very little wind,
and the grass coming on splendidly;
there will be a good pick before long.
I found another dozen sheep dead, but
all I have lost were old or very poor.
If I don’t lose more than fifty I shall
be satisfied. The rest will improve before
long.
Friday, September 1. —More rain
to-day. Nice warm wind from the north ;
a light drizzle and then a steady pour.
Another inch. It will just top things off
nicely; with a few more showers we
shall have wonderful feed before long. I
found two sheep stuck in a boggy little
patch like two flies on flypaper and
pulled them out. One staggered away
and began to nibble at the grass straight-
way ; the other just lay down dnd seemed
all out.. When I tried to make it stand
up it groaned, and when a sheep does
that it is very far gone ; it is extraordinary
how much pain they will stand before
they make a murmur about it. I put it
out of its misery.
Saturday, September 2. —A nice, warm
morning, with a heavy shower or two;
there will be more, from the look of the
sky.
Wonderful! The rain is falling like
clockwork, and the weather is made to
order.
I went into the township this after-
noon in the gig and saw grinning faces
everywhere. I had a few noggins; my
first since Adam was a lad. The pubs
are getting a good dividend out of the
rain already.-
Took stock again to-night. Wool will
now bring about £l7 a bale ; £663. Ewes
and lambs should easily bring ten bob
a head ; £l2OO. Wool and the lambs
will more than clear the wool firm and
leave the ewes free of debt. And, what
is more, the ewes will be in good nick.
What a difference from a week ago!
I had just about dropped my bundle

then. Now I shall be able to get an
advance on the ewes from my brokers,
and will pay something off back debts,
and get some clothing and odds and ends

bare.
After writing that I began to wonder
how many graziers are thinking on much
the same lines now that rain has fallen
and wool has risen. There must be
thousands I can imagine so many little
streams of money running into towns
and cities, in and out of grocers shops
butchers shops, clothing shops, banks

In a little while there will be a bustle
in Sydney, and Melbourne people will
walk with a brighter step and more hope-
ful hearts because there has been ram
in the back country and wool has risen.
Salt Tides.
BY MARGARET FANE AND HILARY LOFTING.
Call her once before you go—
Call once yet!
THE type was blurring, the words run-
ning together. This was dusk, the
beginning of dark. He moved over
to the verandah-rail to catch the last of
the light, the book held close to his
straining eyes.
Now my brothers call from the bay,
Now the great winds shorewards blow.
Below the Cronulla rocks the voice of
the sea was a heavy murmur, like an
undertone to the verse surging through
his mind, his heart, his spirit.
Now the salt tides seaward flow;
Now the wild white horses play....
He looked down at the shadows thick-
ening on the sea. The wild white
horses.... He came back to the book,
was lost in it, was the forsaken merman
in the graveyard of the little grey church
by the white-walled town, peering in
through the window, searching, search-
ing.... For the dear human wife, the
mother of the sea-children (“the cold
strange eyes of a little Mermaiden”), who
had gone back, forsaken the kings of the
sea. Forsaken her red gold throne in
the heart of the sea, the wild white horses,
the storms, the glory. For the little grey
church at Easter, a spinning-wheel, a
sorrowing peace.... He shut the book.
For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden
And the gleam of her golden hair....
The shadows marched on the sea. “A
ceiling of amber, a pavement of pearl.”
Who knows? “And the gleam of her
golden hair.”
A bathe before dinner —there was time.
The sea at dusk, warm under the
shadows. He slipped out of his flannels
into his bathing-suit, took a towel, was
climbing down the rocks, the low heavy
murmur of the sea coming nearer. The
fringe of beach, the sea’s lips kissing his
feet in the twilight.
Not here. In the pool round the point
where the rocks ran out. “She left lonely
for ever the kings of the sea.” The dark,
violet loveliness of the sea. She left
that, left the kings of that —for peace at
Easter, and a grey church
She sat in the pool, a crown of sea-
weed on her head, her hair gleaming pale
gold. What of her body was out-of the
water was a shimmering green, making
darting lights in the violet p 001....
He felt his bare feet become still on the
sand, felt his heart pause. The murmur
of the sea was stilled as his gaze enfolded
her. All his sixteen had brought
him at last to this
She looked up, saw his enchanted face,
laughed.
“Did I frighten you?” she asked. Her
voice released his heart and the sea’s
voice and set the twilight moving again.
“N 0”.... He closed his eyes. “I
thought”.... She watched him steadily
from the pool. At last he also laughed.
“I’m a fool. The sea’s shadows and your
hair and your green one-piece.... I
thought—l’m afraid I thought you were a
mermaid! ”
“A mermaid?”
“Yes. Your crown of seaweed”....
“My hair and my” Green eyes
stared at him.
“Oh, well.” He sat on the sand. “You’re
not a mermaid, are you, ashore in the
dusk?”
She laughed again, thrust two gleaming
feet out of the pool. “Look! ”
“They,” he stammered—“they’re pret-
tier than a tail.” The sand drifted through
his fingers. Was he awake, alive? His
courage vanished ; he could say nothing
to her (“ ‘Dear heart,’ I said, ‘we are long
alone’ ”).
She took the seaweed crown from her
hair. “Lost your voice?”
He blushed. “I —I’m not quite awake.
I was reading, reading ‘The Forsaken
Merman.’ ”
She glanced up from her replaiting of
the crown. “Uh?” she said.
“It’s a poem,” he explained. A mer-
man king who loved a human. She went
down into the sea with him and had
children and was his queen. But she
was afraid of losing her soul; she left
him and her children and came up ro
earth again. Forsaking him. Matthew
Arnold wrote it. The crown broke and
fell into the pool.
“Give it to me,” he said.
She threw it to him. “Catch!”
He caught it. “Is this your pool?”
He was bending over the broken crown.
“Do you come here often?”
“Pretty well,” she told him. “Why?”
“Because” Nothing more would
come.
She stood up, came out of the pool,
was beside him, the gathering night about
her. “I’m going n0w”....
(“ ‘Go up, dear heart, through the
waves’ ”). He gasped, catching at his
courage. “Swim with me to-morrow
morning—early. Will you meet me here
at six o’clock?”
All loveliness of mystery was in her
eyes looking at him a moment. “All
right,” she said, and was gone in the
night.
The mater was shirty about his being
late for dinner, but that was nothing.
Phil and Alice tried to be funny, but
that—and dinner —was less than nothing.
There was the climb up the rocks where
her feet had trod, there was the night
outside the silly room. Soon he was
sitting on the rocks, only the sea-voice
breaking the silence, only the stars break-
ing the dark.
You went on, fumbling, unhappy, half
a kid and half a man, wondering, afraid
to ask, afraid to learn, to know....
Searching in books for it, searching in
your own thought.... Why was the
reason for it a mystery?
Yet, it must be a mystery. That was
best. Look at her face ; look at all the
glow and glory in “The Forsaken Mer-
man’’ —the mystery was never broken ;
that was its spirit. Look at her face.
If he could see it now beside him here,
the grave green eyes under the gold
hair that was so pale. He could see it,
shadowy in the dark, though he was
alone. No ; never alone n0w....
... .Clear falls the moonlight
When spring-tides are low;
When sweet airs come seaward
From heaths starred with br00m....
Well, there was the night to get through.
To-morrow he would see herself and not
this ghost—early, when Cronulla, Aus-
tralia, all the fatheaded world was still
asleep.
But she didn’t come.
He waited, a black chill creeping into
his heart as the minutes fled by. The
light on the sea was bleak, the soft breeze
tragic. At half-past seven he gave it up,
dashed into the surf, and strode bitterly
home to breakfast.
Yet—she might have overslept, or mis-
taken the place (no, she couldn’t do
that) —well, anyhow, she might have a
stickybeaking mother, His heart was
hungry. Anything might have happened ;
you couldn’t tell. He’d go to the pool
to-night. At dusk.
Somehow the day fagged round to
noon, to afternoon, to the beginning of
evening. Cronulla was a foul place.
And his heart was longing, longing. She
wouldn’t be there yet. Not for hours.
He drifted round the verandah to his
room:
A silk shirt, his new white ducks —he
made his shoes gleam. Those brown
silk socks....
For the cold strange eyes of a little Mer-
maiden....
He took the book from his table and
slipped it into his pocket. He’d tell her
“The Forsaken Merman,” read “(Enone”
to her, and “The Lotos Eaters”....
He needn’t wait till dusk. He could
go and sit in the little cave above the
lower track ; he could see the pool from
there.
In the cave he stared out to sea a
moment, dusted a rock and sat down,
opening the book.
Yes. “The Lotos Eaters,” and that
“close of apricots upon the road of
Samarcand” thing—“ The Sick King in
Bokhara.” And the “Nightingale,” the
lovely “Nightingale”—he’d watch her
eyes while he told her that. He knew it
by heart. “My heart aches, and a
drowsy”
Voices on the lower track —her voice!

explains
Dr. F. de COURMELLES
of the Paris Society of Practising Physicians
and Surgeons
Do YOU suffer from every ailment that
happens ? Have YOU constipation, indigestion,
gastritis, backache, catarrh, pimples ? Do YOU
suffer from headaches, rheumatism, eczema,
neuritis, weakness of any organ, gas in the
stomach and bowels or bladder complaint ? Is
YOUR appetite poor .... vitality lacking ? It
is because you are unconsciously permitting
poisons that bring on disorder and disease to
remain in your system.
The scientific way to keep
your body internally
clean
No matter how regular your daily habits, par-
ticles of food waste become .encrusted in the
f walls of the intestine. This waste accumulates
and breeds germ-producing poisons which enter
the blood stream. The poisons undermine your
health—taking power from the life-giving organs
of nature —making you old years before your
time. Most sickness is now traced to dreaded
self-poisoning (autoxima) —the result of hidden
unsuspected constipation.
Brink COLO SEPTIC
Be clean INTERNALLY. Dislodge this crust
from the intestine and cleanse the blood stream.
Free the system from the poisonous waste. Drink
COLOSEPTIC in hot water of a morning.
COLOSEPTIC acts on the intestine, the
kidneys, the pores of the skin, and the respiratory
organs—Nature’s four great channels for the
disposal of impurities from the body.
COLOSEPTIC increases secretion of the gastric
and intestinal juices .... it keeps the intestinal
and digestive tube CLEAN . . . combats lassi-
tude, fatigue, “ blues,” and other symptoms of
self-poisoning.

“Guess what I did last night, Ada?”
Another voice: “What?”
He crept to the edge of the cave and
looked down. There she was, and an-
other girl, and two —two boy friends....
“Well, ye see, old Pigface keeps me
late at the shop an’ it’s hot. So I ducks
home, slips into me one-piece, an’ ducks
down here for a dip.”
“Naughty, naughty!” one of the boy-
friends said in high falsetto.
“Oh, you! ” she replied in measure-
less, affectionate scorn. “An’, Ada—see
that bit of a pool down there? Well, you
remember Anita Hermosa in ‘Saved
from the Sea’ —where he thinks she’s
a mermaid? Well, / did that—sat in the
pool and put a seaweed crown on me
head”
“Go on!” Ada protested.
“I did. An’ —believe it or not — a coot
—young Raynor from the big place up
top—was gogglin’ at me from the beach!
So I lets ’im have it. ‘Did I frighten you?’
I says. Just like Anita did—slow and
quiet—an’ I laughs. ‘Are you a mer-
maid?’ he says, sissy-like”
In the cave he covered his face. Oh,
to shut his ears for ever from all sound,
to be blind, to be dead....
“... .about a pome an’ a king of the
sea an’ some tart. Lot o’ rot’.’-— -r
“Ah!” said the other boy-friend. “Too
much pitchers an’ these novelettes.” He
nodded. heavily. “Do we stop ’ere all
the arvo?”'
“’E made a date,” she said, moving
on. “Six o’clock in the morning, if you
please! ”
“Go on! ” Ada was stunned again.
“Jer keep it?”
“Whadyer think I am?” she cried in-
dignantly. “Did I”- The sounds faded,
were gone.
No death came. Only despair, dazed
and spent, crying out for death, weep-
ing for death
And presently a black anger. Mon-
strous betrayal—this was the mystery.
This foul cheat that left you empty.
The.book, the lying book. Not again
would he ever.... To hurl it into the
sea...,
He caught it up from the cave’s floor.
Open, sand on the leaves. ... It had
meant so much, all the years. But not
again , , - ;
The page stared at him:
Day, like our souls, is fiercely dark;
What then? ’Tis day!.... ..\ , j !
He looked up, out to sea. ..The tears
dried on his face. Soon he sighed once,i
slipped the book into his pocket. !
Do Not Blame Love.
Do not blame Love whenas in going
He leaves you heartbroke and stricken sore.
The tide must ebb that you joyed in, flowing;
The rind’s a shroud when you’ve eaten the
core.
Still you’ll remember Love on his pinions—
’ Love on his pinions, eager and strong;
For out of the-glory you made your song.
"'Ah, twice indeed are* you young Love’s debtor:
The joy you have known, the song you have
sung.
In the salt of tears you shall savor the kisses,
And walk one enchanted plain mortals
among.
Sad you’ll remember Love on his pinions;
The star-dusted plume, the snowy breast’s
gleam— ;
The sorrow, the sorrow has given the dream! j

Remembering.
I sit to-night and ponder.
Dark shadows in the west,
And all the mountains yonder,
Where we no more may wander,
Are robed in robes of rest;
And I beneath the gleaming
Of city lights am dreaming
The old, dead days were best
For Death’s chill hand has taken
The friends who stood by me.
In comradeship unshaken
They sleep and will not waken
By city, mine or sea;
And’ I, the last, am lonely,
And dream the dread dreams only
Of joys no more to be.
We trod the ways of heather;
_ Their, glory shall not wane;
We’ve ridden out together
Through blazing Queensland weather
Where drought and fire fiends reign;
We’ve known the joys of battle,
The mad stampede of cattle
On many, a, western plain..
No time or toil effaces
- Those scenes of old delight.
No more the mad night races,
The keen wind in our faces,
The long road gleaming white;
The misty hills before us,
And dark-blue heavens o’er us
With lamps of silver bright.
Oh, do they long,'l wonder,
When dews the woods adorn,
To hear the hot hoofs thunder,
The white road flowing under
Adown the slopes of morn,
To watch the white clouds drifting,
To see the mist veil lifting
Before the day, newborn?
Past joys 1 would recover,
Turn back the folded page.
When wandering days are over,
Ah! sorrow for the rover
With heart that does not age,
While campfires still are beacons,
Whose footstep fails and weakens
Upon the final stage.

A witch’s moon has touched the trees
With stillness and with silent flame;
And in their dream the death-white seas
Are murmuring your name.
To-night is goblin festival!
If, ’neath its moon, the dead may roam,
And life there be in death at all,
Dear ghost of mine, come home!
I keep this last and lonely tryst
Beside the lichened trysting-stone
Where from all hearts the coiling mist
Hid our two hearts alone.
Ah! little ghost, fear not to come!
Though to your death-enchanted ken
The fairy tunes have long grown dumb
To which we hearkened then.
Now, lone, I hark to goblin drums;
Anon to fiddles ' phantom-played;
And now, a-thrill to that which comes,
I am no more afraid.
I am no more with pain or fear!
Death’s hand has loosed his guarding bars,
Cold lips are singing shrill and clear
A cradle song of stars..
That, though you come not, tells me this:
You are the shadow . and the sun,
Sea-laughter and the morning’s kiss,
And death and life are one!

The Haunted House.
With Black woods enclosed, and the dark,
ploughed lands
Where magpies dance‘in the furrows’ fall,
Asleep in-the sun. the old house stands,
With twisted chimneys and rough grey wall.
In the garden of-roses and hollyhocks,
Through the hum of many a drowsy bee,
By clipped box hedges and scented stocks,
Comes the restless sound of the sea.
Mullioned windows;' a Tudor arch;
Leaded panes where the ivy swings; .
An old sundial; beyond the larch,
Blue-grey pigeons with whirring wings;
Rooks in the elms; a secret room
Where the pale priest hid in King Harry’s
day;
A narrow tunnel of bats and gloom
That led to the seashore a mile away.
A carven table, a yellow screen;
My lady’s workbox, with fluted silk
In the cover under the dark, shagreen,
Where her slim hand fluttered'' as ' sleek as
milk*; < •
A powder closet; a warming pan;
Brass fireirons ’for the great Yule log; ,
The old lord’s portrait (that was a man!)
Painted here with his favorite-d0g....
My lady cared not for horse nor hound;
Hours .she spent*-at gilt* prie-dieu:
Solace perhaps for her heart she found.
In other things than .the-old lord knew.
For in the .locket, upon .her breast
Was closed 1 a curl that was bright and red
(That -my lord--was black-haired must be con-
fessed : - - . ,
’Tis soonest where' least is said).
And among the silks of-her workbox laid
May have' lain a miniature none might see—
By the needle set; in the rich brocade
taught can have lurked but a memory.
Potpourri brown in an Eastern jar ,
Was once red roseleaf and- bergamot. ■
Why stir the ’ dust in the' grey old house,
Where hate ■ and .passion are-both forgot?
Where tears have washed out a'stolen'kiss ;
When long, black hours in the dark have tried
To bring regret for a lawless' bliss—
Waking there by the old lord’s side
The old lord sleeps on the churchyard hill;
His family vault is a splendid. thing.
But I do not think that she lies so still:-
She wanders yet in the southern wing,
Hearing the bats in the ivy swoop,
Hearing the bees in the rosary,
Seeing a curl in a chestnut loop
And the long, long miles of sea.

Do Not Carry Unnecessary
Burdens During 1934
The Pelman Method
Besides the twelve textbooks
of Pelmanism, containing inf or-
mation and graded mental exer-
cises of great practical value,
each lesson is accompanied by
a Progress Work Sheet to be
submitted to the Institute. These
Work Sheets are carefully re-
vised by qualified Examiners and
returned with letters of advice.
Progress Work Sheets and
Letters combined constitute a
chain of personal references in
which the full scope of the Pel-
man System is brought to bear
on the development of the
student and on his personal diffi-
culties. This thorough revisional
work is an outstanding feature
of the Pelman training.
The Effect
of Pelmanism
The obvious effect of the Pel-
man Training, observable very
early in the Course, is a quick
and accurate memory for faces,
names, facts, figures, business
conversations, for what has
been said and what has been
read, for what has been done
and what is to do, for cards,
languages and the general
material of study.
There is a quickening of the
natural perceptive faculties re-
flected in increased ability to
concentrate, greater powers of
decision and much greater
confidence, so that we find
Pelmanists in all walks of life
accepting cheerfully, inside and
outside their occupations, respon-
sibilities that they were once
afraid of.
They seek and get better posi-
tions, they are able to % speak
without notes, they meet others
on terms of equality, they accept
office in Lodge, in Council, in
Parliament, and acquit them-
selves creditably.
In short, Pelmanists carry
within themselves a wider range
of consciousness, greater apti-
tudes, and justified self-confi-
dence, qualities which give
personality and mark their
possessors for advancement and
progress.
Pelmanism is for anyone
who has aspirations and
ambition.
You are sure to be interested in at
least one of the people who, in “The s
Efficient Mind,” speak highly of Pel-
manism from practical experience. It
may be a prominent personality who
has captured your imagination, or it
may be a neighbor who has earned
your respect. Get a copy of “The
Efficient Mind” now—write at once.
IF your concentration is defective so that you do not master
problems that should be within the range of your mental
ability; if your will-power is weak so that you are stopped
by obstacles that normal energy and courage would get
through, under or over with a laugh; if you are lacking in
self-confidence so that you stand by timidly whilst others
take what might easily be yours; if your memory fails so
often at critical moments that you nave become fearful of
yourself—if you have these disabilities, or one of them, you
are carrying an entirely unnecessary burden.
DELMANISM, by training on positive lines, will take this burden from
you. It will change “I don’t care” or ”1 can’t” to I want and I will.
It will do this by quickening your perceptions so that the means by which
you gather information, store it and make use of it will be fully competent;
it will start the beneficent interaction between ability and confidence, that
marvellous extension of power the steps of which are effort followed by
confidence, and greater effort by greater confidence, until achievement becomes
the rule, judgment and decision habitual processes and self-confidence an
integral part of the personality.
/CONCENTRATION, will-power, self-confidence, a reliable memory,
these are the qualities that Pelmanism develops. It might almost be said
that Pelmanism creates them, for so marked is the change in the Pelmanist
that for practical purposes he acquires, in many important respects, a new, a
stronger and a more engaging personality.
OUT the process is one of development, not of creation, for happily in every
t-' normal individual the attributes /and powers are there, and proper
training will bring them out.

—in the sweat and steam, the stealth and sinister dealings that may form the
atmosnhere of industrial workers. It shows the reaction of a girl of clean character
and aman who! in other circumstances, might have been an inspiration to men.
The Press Gave Unstinted Praise to “The Doughman.”
