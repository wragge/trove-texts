SOME RECENT BOOKS.
Labour and Luxury, a reply to “ Merrie Eng-
land,” by Nemo (paper, Is 3d), takes as its
motto a pregnant sentence by Frederic Harri-
son : “ There is a safe and a dangerous Socialism
before us. And of all our public wants none is
so urgent as wise teaching about the limits and
the consequences of these two.” The book
itself is a readable counterblast to Blatchford’s
vague and foolish rhetoric. Its strength is
chiefly due to quotation and the thoughts sug-
gested by quotation ; but the writer marshals
authorities and arguments with some dexterity.
A Memoir of Gladstone, by H. W. Lucy (cloth,
Is 4d), is cheap and readable, and has a good
portrait of the clever old man. Lucy is gener-
ally lucid, and has the story-telling knack;
though his standpoint is conventional and his
comment feeble and common-place. Sentences
like the following (p. 239) show only that the
most practised hand may slip occasionally :
“ To the gifts of a mobile countenance, a voice
sonorous and flexible, and a fine presence, Mr.
Gladstone possesses dramatic instincts, ” &c.
The Adventures of Harry Richmond (paper,
lOd ; cloth, 4s), published in Bell’s Indian anc
Colonial Library, is only the first of a flight
cheap Merediths, which should help to make
familiar to the multitude the genius of the
greatest living writer of English Action.
Marion Crawford’s The Ralstons, H. S. Cunnin
ham’s Sibylla, and Thos. Hardy’s Far from ti e
Madding Crowd, come to hand in “Macmillan
Colonial Library ” (paper, 2s lOd)—that exce
lent and deservedly popular collection. The
first-named, as also “ Rolf Boldrewood’s
Sphinx of Eaglehawk (issued by the same pu )-
Ushers; canves, 2s 3d), has previously bee
noticed. Sibylla is a tale of slight interest anc
no value ; and The Madding Crowd a welcom
re-issue of one of Hardy's best romances—a fin
piece of work which takes semi-classical rank
Burning Questions, by W. Peart- Robinson (pape
Is 3d), is chiefly intended for the British public
In several clear and readable essays the autho: ■
advocates that Freetrade should give way to
Fairtrade, which is to pave the way for imperia
customs-union.
A Primer of Evolution, by Edward Clodd (cloth
Is 9d), is an abridgment of “The Story o !
Creation, ”by the same author—a useful disciple
and interpreter of Darwin, Haeckel, and Huxley
The little book is admirably done, within its
limits; and serves well as an introduction t
further study.
Boot and Saddle Stories, by W. Ferrars Aubur
(Ward, Lock and Bowden; paper, Is 3d), is
collection of sketches of life in the army whic i
•have conceivably some interest for armyreaders,
but little or none for the general workman" a;
literature.

listed.

Balaam and his Master, and other sketches
and stories, by doel Chandler Harris,
*** With the doubtful exception of “The
Odd Number,” the stories in this series
are rather recommended by style and
sympathy than by plot o? vivid interest.
Davis and Harris have considerable Ameri-
can vogue, justified by their drollery and
perception ; but the average reader finds
them tending to dullness. Yerga, Suder-
mann, and Anatole France employ the
charm of| simplicity, not the fascination of
strength and splendour. Bourget’s stories
are lilies, not roses of literature—unless it
be white moss-roses. De Maupassant’s
striking book can be recommended for
general purchase ; the others require some
“ acquired taste,” some welcome of appre-
ciative culture. Paper, 3s. each.

COUGHS, GOLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
OHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
OUREH BY Hearne’a Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness m the
nhest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
„nd it never allows a cough or asthma to become
ohronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
„ n d a complete cure is certain.
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to
obtai HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
nrove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
gev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
verv ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
nletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it • he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo. ....
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
„ou that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle or his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. W X Ail,
Newtown, Geelong.” .
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by

We wish it to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely Inclusive variety ol the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask lor everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
(or the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in hold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the tew
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
lit the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
neveroease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they'
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

Why Suffer One Moment
From Torturing Skin Diseases
When a single application of the Cuticura Remedies will, in
the great majority of cases, instantly relieve the most agonizing of
itching, burning, scaly, crusted, pimply, and blotchy skin and scalp
diseases, and point to a permanent and economical (because so
speedy) cure, when the best physicians and all other remedies fail ?
Cuticura Remedies are the
greatest skin cures, blood purifiers,
and humor remedies, are absolutely
pure, and may be used by the
youngest and most delicate with
gratifying and unfailing success.
CUTICURA
the great skin cure, instantly
allays the most intense itching,
burning and inflammation, permits
rest and sleep, speedily heals the CUTICURA TYPES OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY,
skin, and restores the hair. Cuticura Soap, an exquisite skin beau-
tifier, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces. Cuticura
Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin Purifier and greatest of Humor
Remedies, cleanses the blood of all impurities and poisonous ele-
ments, and thus removes the cause. Hence the Cuticura Remedies
cure every disease and humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss
of hair, from infancy to age, from pimples to scrofula.
Atx ABOUT THE Blood, Skin, Scalp, and Hair,” 64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illustra-
tions and 100 Testimonials, is wrapped around every bottle of the Cuticura Resolvent.

AN UNTIMELY THOUGHT.
I wonder what day of the week —
I wonder what month of the year—
Will it be midnight, or morning,
. And who will bend over my bier ?
What a hideous fancy to come
As I wait at the foot of the stair,
While Lilian gi ves the last touch
To her robe, or the rose in her hair!
Do I like your new dress—Pompadour ?
And do I like you ? On my life,
You are eighteen, and not a day more,
And have not been six years my wife.
Those two rosy boys in the crib
Upstairs are not ours, to be sure—
You are just a sweet bride in her bloom,
All sunshine, and snowy and pure.
As the carriage rolls down the dark street
The little wife laughs and makes cheer —
But —l wonder what day of the-week.
I wonder what month of the year I

Good-night! I have to say good-night
To such a host of peerless things !
Good-night unto the fragile hand
All queenly with its weight of rings;
Good-night to fond, uplifted eyes,
Good-night to chestnut braids of hair,
Good-night unto the perfect mouth
And all the sweetness nestled there —
The snowy hand detains me ! then
I’ll have to say good-night again.
But there will come a time, my love,
When, if I read our stars aright,
I shall not linger by this porch
\\ ith my adieus. Till then, good-night!
You wish the time were now ? And I.
You do not blush to wish it so ?
You would have blushed yourself to death
To own so much a year ago—
What, both these snowy hands ! ah, then,
. I’ll have to say good-night again.

THREE SONNETS.
What is a sonnet ? ’Tis the pearly shell
That murmurs of the far-off murmuring sea ;
A precious jewel carved most curiously ;
It is a little pictu-re painted well.
What is a sonnet? ’Tis the tear that fell
From a great poet’s hidden ecstasy ;
A two-edged sword, a star, a song—ah me 1
Sometimes a heavy-tolling funeral bell.
Tliis was the flame that shook with Dante’s breath,
The solemn organ whereon Milton played,
And the clear glass where Shakespeare’s
shadow falls ;
A sea this is—beware who ventureth !
For like a fjord the narrow floor is laid
Mid ocean deep to the sheer mountain walls.
1844.
RICHARD WATSON GILDER.
The world is too much with ns ; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
Little we see in Nature that is ours ;
We have given our hearts away—a sordid boon.
This sea that bares her.bosom to the moon ;
' The winds that will be howling at all hours,
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers :
For this, for everything, we are out of tune;
It moves us not. Great God 1 I’d rather be
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn ;
Have sight of Proteus coming from the sea,
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.

WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.
Mysterious Night ! when our first parenfknew
Thee from report divine, and heard thy name,
Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,
This glorious canopy of light and blue?
Yet, ’neath a curtain of translucent dew,
Bathed in the rays of the great setting frame*
Hesperus with the host of heaven came :
And lo ! Creation widened in man’s view !
Who could have thought such darkness lay con-
cealed
Within thy beams, O Sun ? or who could find,
Whilst fly and leaf and insect stood revealed,
That to such countless orbs thou mad’st us blind?
Why do we, then, shun Death with anxious strife?
If Light can thus deceive, wherefore not Life ?

The Bi-metallic Craze.
The advent in Australia of Moreton
Frewen, the eloquent advocate of bimetal-
lism, has aroused a considerable amount of
interest in the complex and dreary subject
of the “meejum of exchange.” A good many
newspapers have been temporarily or per-
manently converted to the new creed—
which is also a very old creed indeed ; and
many miscellaneous cranks have begun to
worship Frewen’s god, and have resolved
that bi-metallism is the cure for all the
financial ills of mankind. The world is out
of joint, and has been so as far back as any-
body has ever heard of, and it is full of
cranks and faddists who believe that their
one single nostrum can cure everything and
everybody. The church prescribes dogma
as the one infallible remedy for poverty,
want of employment, unequal distribution of
wealth, dirt, disease, doubt, discontent,
ignorance, bad trade, bad laws, and every
other trouble. The teetotaller proposes to
cure all that has gone wrong by prohibition
and cold tea. The Foreign-trader of the
M‘Mxllan variety regards imported shoddy
as the universal panacea ; the Protec-
tionist of the old school has an equally
universal remedy in a protective tariff;
the Single-tax fanatic proposes to straighten
up everything under the sun by putting all
taxation on the soil ; and now a new and
enthusiastic howler has arisen in the land
who believes that all troubles have their
origin in the “meejum of exchange,” and
that when silver is made legal tender and its
value defined in a certain fixed ratio to that
of gold, this weary, soulless, sin-stained old
world will begin to go straight at last.
• • •
The average enthusiast only holds one
craze at a time, and his faith in that is a
profound and solemn thing. The aggra-
vated type of Single-taxer firmly believes
that there is healing and regeneration in his
nostrum alone, despite the fact that China
has been run on what is practically a Single-
tax basis for centuries, and hasn’t risen one
inch out of her old-time petrifaction. The
Freetrader pure and simple is confronted
by the fact that a dozen great nations winch
have tried his remedy have given it up in
despair, and of the few which still adhere to it
several have sunk into something approach-
ing beggary. The Tory Protectionist isn’t
troubled in the least by the fact that, even
in the countries which have grown rich in
the aggregate under his system, the struggle
for existence is about as desperate as it is
anywhere else, and that often the struggle
is hardest in the country where most riches
are accumulated. The churches keep on
prescribing faith as a medicine for every ill,
just as if the world had not had faith, more
or less, for 1900 miserable years; and the Cold
Tea fiend keeps on prescribing Prohibition,
regardless of the fact that the world has been
experimenting with Prohibition, and giving it
up in disgust for ages, and that almost every
land which has been discovered where
alcohol was unknown has been a land of
ignorance and barbarism and gore and
general blight, and that the Prohibitionist
himself is a gaunt, ill-omened warning to
other men not to follow in his footsteps.
And it matters nothing at all to the bi-
metallist that this globe has tried over and
over again in different places, mono-metal-
lism, bi-metallism, tri-metallism, other kinds
of metallism, hard money, soft money,
barter, and various other things, and has
been, on the whole, very much the same
kind of a globe through it all.
* • *
.Bi-metallism, on the whole, is not a sub-
ject which is calculated to excite much
popular enthusiasm. It is about the most
desolate-looking of all the single fads by
which man is always on the point of being
regenerated, and in spite of which he never
actually regenerates to any great extent.
The theory of Moreton Frewen and his
party is that it is possible, by an agreement
among all the leading nations of the world,
to fix gold and silver on a permanent rela-
tive value, which relative value they will
maintain without any fluctuations whatever.
If both metals are made legal tender on the
assumption that, say, 15|oz. of silver equal
loz. of gold, then it is claimed of
silver will be worth loz. of gold, and
will always continue so while the agreement
lasts. Even if the world should begin
to produce 30oz. of silver for loz. of gold,
reckoning only the quantities available for
coinage after all demands for other purposes
are satisfied, the price of silver is not to go
down ; and even if the production of the
white metal becomes only seven times, in-
stead of 15i times, that of gold, its price is
not to go up. The natural desire for the
smaller and more portable variety of coinage
is not to create any preference which will
upset the equilibrium. All this looks about
as promising as the theory that an inter-
national agreement could enact that 11b. of
tea shall always be equal in value to 15|lb.
of rock-salt, no matter what circumstances
may arise, and it also looks just about as
useful. Outside of a comparatively small
knot of enthusiasts, there are few people
who can see any more cause for rejoicing in
the fact that loz. of gold is worth 15|oz. of
silver, than in the fact that it is worth 15|
tons of road-metal or any other substance.
* • *
It is an acknowledged fact that since silver
ceased to be legal tender among the leading
commercial nations of Europe, the prices of
most articles of merchandise have seriously
decreased. This has been a heavy loss to
the producer and a considerable gain to the
consumer, and as the producer and the con-
sumer are, in the aggregate, the same indi-
vidual, things in this respect are practically
equal. Also —which is much more serious—
the change has been, in a sense, greatly to
the disadvantage of the nations which
borrow money, and great'y to the advantage
of those which lend it. If Australia were
to pay off her public debt, she would
require to export nearly twice as much pro-
duce to raise the required amount as she
would have had to do a few decades ago.
This, however, is much less of a disadvantage
than it looks. The payment of the public
debt is an event which shows no signs of
taking place for severalcenturies, and what the
state of things may be when the time arrives
—if it ever does arrive—is not a matter for
present consideration. It doubtless ought to
be a matter for present consideration, but it is
necessary to deal, not with the things which
should be, but with those that are. The
burden at the present time is not the prin-
cipal but the interest, and the rate of interest
has diminished so largely along with the
diminution of prices that the Australian
public debt of £200,000,000 odd is not much
more of a burden than a similar debt would
have been at the prices and the interest rates
of 40 years ago.
* * *
Bi-metallists claim that the afore-men-
tioned fall in prices is the direct consequence
of the demonetisation of silver, and that it
silver were again made legal tender they
would go up to their old standard, or some-
thing approaching thereto. So far as con-
cerns the producer and the consumer this
would matter little ; an all-round rise of,
say, 100 per cent., would leave these two
individuals practically just where they are
now. And if prices have fallen owing to the
demonetisation of silver, which is exceed-
ingly doubtful, there is just as good reason
to believe that interest has gone down from
the same cause, and would rise again in the
same fashion if the white metal were rehabi-
litated, in which case—so long as no
attempt is made to repay the prin-
cipal of the public debt—everybody
would be just about where he was before.
Also, bi-metalhsm takes no account of the
fact that, taking the world as a whole, silver
has not been demonetised—instead there is
more silver coin in circulation than there
ever was before. It ignores the fact
that prices were steadily declining long
before the date of the alleged demonetisation,
and that the decline was hardly accelerated
in the least by that more or less apocryphal
event. And, in assuming that the abolition
of silver as legal tender money in certairj
countries was the sole cause of the fall in
values, it assumes that nothing whatever
was owing to the great extension of
road, railway and steamship communication
which enables all manner of things to be
brought to market at greatly diminished
cost, the great increase of supplies
because improved mechanism is con-
stantly enabling each human unit to produce
more to-day than he did yesterday, and the
further great increase of production through
the opening-up of new lands in Australia,
Africa, South America, and other formerly
waste regions. The doctrine which assumes
that all these influences had nothing, or very
little, to do with the general reduction of
prices, and that the alleged demonetisation
of silver was the main cause of it all, makes
a very steep assumption indeed.
• * •
The reason for the bi-metallic gospel, put
into the fewest words, is that the practical
withdrawal of silver from coinage in certain
countries has so reduced the amount of avail-
able money that an artificial scarcity has
been created, and the value of gold has there-
fore been forced up to such an extent that
in most lines it now takes nearly twice as
much goods to buy a sovereign as it did a
few decades ago. And just here the silver
gospel falls heavily over the unaccountable
facts that there is now about three times as
much money in existence as there was before
the alleged demonetisation process started ;
that even in some of the countries where
silver was demonetised the amount of silver
coin has not, apparently, diminished; and
that, instead of a scarcity, the complaint is of
a superabundance of money lying idle in
banks at all the great centres of commerce,
and vainly seeking for a profitable outlet.
And, so far as concerns the frequent allega-
tion about the fall in the market value'of
silver since the frequently-aforementioned
demonetisation, it is a lamentable fact that
between 1600 and 1700, and again between
1700 and 1800, the fall in silver values was
almost as great as that during the present
century. These things may not prove that
the bi-metallic theory is wrong, but they
lend so much confusion to a subject that was
already about the most complex on record
that The Bulletin hereby suspends its
opinion indefinitely, and waits, though in an
unfavorable frame of mind, for further evi-
dence.
• # »
For the present, in fact, this paper regret-
fully declines to regard bi-metallism seriously.
Still it is open to conviction in the matter.
If the bi-metallists can prove that the de-
monetisation of silver was the cause of the
general decline in values, and not increased
production, steam, electricity, improved
machinery, cheaper and faster means of com-
munication, and the opening up of new
countries ; or even if they can prove that a
certain definite proportion of the decline was
owing to these causes, and that the silver
disaster was responsible for the rest, it will
probably view the matter in a wholly new
light. It will do the same if the alleged
scarcity of money, owing to the withdrawal
of silver, can be supported by any reasonable
evidence ; or if it can be proved that gold
and silver can be kept at any fixed ratio to
each other by any amount of international
agreement; or if anything else of value can
be proved relative to the case. Meanwhile
it recognises, in a purely selfish sense, that
bi-metallism would probably force up the
price of silver considerably, and at least for
a time, and that Australasia, as a silver-pro-
ducing country, would profit largely thereby,
while its big silver-deposits held out, and
assuming it did not lose more than it gained
through a corresponding depreciation of gold,
and providing nothing of an unforeseen charac-
ter ensued to spoil an otherwise beautiful cal-
culation. To that limited extent, and with a
solemn conviction that something of an un-
foreseen character probably would ensue,
it is a bi-raetallist—but no further. Bi-
metallism, regarded as a cure for things in
general, looks just as promising as the great
Cold-Tea theory, which is based on equally
convincing statistics —and as many other
theories. Even if it should come to
pass, which seems eminently improbable, it
will certainly produce very few of the results
expected ftom it. The precept which every
faddist should gum in his hat for constant
reference is that the world can’t be re-
generated by one idea, whether it be religious
dogma, prohibition, single-tax, freetrade,
protection, eight-hours, one-raan-one-vote,
bi-metallism, or anything else. Neither can
it be regenerated by ten ideas, or even by
several more. There are a good many hun-
dred things which want to be done before it
will be much the better, and the person who
preaches his one particular little shred of
gospel as a panacea is only an oppressive
bore and a disappointment. If bi-metallism
proves its case, then it can claim to rank as
one small item in a long programme of re-
form, but, so far, it hasn’t definitely proved
anything.
Tariff Questions.
You can’t make an omelette without breaking
eggs ; and, if Australia wants Federation, she
will have to pay the price. Federatioa will
certainly not be consummated without indi-
vidual hardship; and, though the community
as a whole will gain immensely, there is no
doubt that, in isolated cases, the loss will over-
shadow the profit. It is very likely, for
example, that Federation—with its inevitable
accompaniment of interprovincial Freetrade
means the destruction of the N.S.W. cane-
sugar industry. That industry is carried on in
the northern coastal districts un ler conditions
which prima-facie make competition with
Queensland sugar-growers possible only so lona
as it is protected. The low-lying lands of the
Clarence and Richmond, where the cane is
chiefly grown, are subject to destructive floods ;
cane-disease is prevalent; and the comparatively
cold climate reduces the sugar-contents of the
cane much below the average yielded in
Queensland. ,
* • *
Now that Treasurer Reid proposes to begin,
at the end of two years, to remove by slow in-
stalments the import duty of £3 per ton which
enables New South Wales to successfully com-
pete with Queensland and foreign-grown, the
manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.
rises to ask the sugar-farmers “if they are
prepared to accept quietly the fate designed for
them,” and emphasises his question with a
threat of withdrawal of the co.’s capital from
their industry. Now, the Colonial Sugar Re-
fining Co. has a very large capital invested in
the New South Wales sugar-industry. It is by
far the largest sugar-miller and refiner in the
province, and probably the majority of the
farmers are dependent upon it either for land,
or for advances, or for crushing power. It is
also the largest sugar-miller and refiner in
Queensland and Fiji; it has refineries in Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Auckland ; and it
acknowledges total assets of 207,369. It is,
in fact, one of the most successful results of
“private enterprise ” in Australasia ; and The
Bulletin allows it every credit for the men it
employs and the men it supports, and the
manner in which its business is conducted.
* • #
But, if there is one thing more clear than
another, it is that the sole object of the Col.
Sugar Refining Co. is, as might be expected, to
earn dividends for its shareholders. It does
not care two straws for anything but this ; and
its operations in every province move by dif-
ferent ways to the same end. It is, of course,
by far the largest employer of black labor in
Australasia ; but the manager’s ad captandum
appeal to New South Wales farmers does not
scruple to lay stress upon the great harm that
will be done to “white industry ” if the New
South Wales duty is removed. No doubt, if
the co. had its way, there would be complete
Australasian freetrade in (cane) sugar, and it
would then supply us— The Bulletin here
assumes that Fiji produces sugar much more
cheaply than New South Wales—almost exclu-
sively from its Fiji mills and plantations,
worked by black - labor. As every Aus-
tralasian province imposes a duty on sugar,
the co. has suited itself to circumstances, and
established mills, or refineries, or plantations
in every province.
* # •
The co. merely uses in New South Wales
now the threat which it found so effective in
Queensland in 1892. When Sam Griffith was
bending under the pressure of the banks to
extend the Polynesian Act, and there seemed
still a chance that he would declare in favor of
a white Australia, the Col. Sugar Co. threw
its weight into the scale with the emphatic
declaration that if black-labor were abolished,
it would be necessary to take its mills and
machinery, and all its Q. capital—upwards o #
a million —over to Fiji. That settled
indecision ; and the colored laborer has become
more and more of a curse in Queensland every
year since. The co. has a black face for Queens-
land ; but a white face for New South Wales.
* m *
The co.’s manager, in order to bolster up his
New South Wales case, says that there “all
the work ” connected with the sugar industry
“is done by white men”—which is not true.
T. Wilmett, of Townsville, accompanied a
Q. Ministerial party round the Tweed River
(N.S.W.) district last year, and informed the
Townsville Bulletin that “ the Kanakas who
have completed their time in Queensland, and
have settled on the Tweed, number about 400.
Many of these lease the land and cultivate it
on their own account, and are large employers
of white labor, to whom they pay the current
rate of wages —.£1 a week with board.” A cor-
respondent wrote The Bulletin of May 19,
’94, that “in the Richmond River sugar-cane
biz. the Caucasian will soon be starved out by
the Hindoo. About a hundred nigs. ‘ our
fellow-subjects,’ have leased farms here, and it
is reported that 300 more are on the way. . . .
For breakfast each man has a cupful of rice;
for dinner, a scone without butter, jam, beef,
or tea ; for supper, a stalk of sugar-cane.”
# # •
These considerations throw some doubt on
the unselfish zeal of the Colonial Sugar Co. for
white industry. The sugar-duties, in fact,
could have found no more unsatisfactory cham-
pion. Their defence must rest, not on the fact
that removal means ruin to the industry, for
Federation must come at whatever cost to indi-
viduals, but on the fact that removal would
merely throw the New South Wales trade into
the arms of Queensland, and it is to the interest
of Australia to fight the black-labor province as
a foreign foe, until it is forced to capitulate.
And advantage should be taken of the mainten-
ance of the duties to prohibit coloured labor in
connection with the sugar-industry in New
South Wales. That industry is speckled now •,
for all the Colonial Sugar Co. cares it will soon
be as piebald as its neighbour.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Rights of a Minority.
The interesting Q. Supreme Court case, Browne
v. Cowley, in which a member of Q. Leg.
Assembly sued the Speaker for damages, conse-
quent on his ejection on Sept. 12 last, resulted
in plaintiff being non-suited by Chief Justice
Griffith. The treatment Browne complained
of was simply the Boodlewraith majority’s
brutal and tyrannical use of its power. The
occasion was the discussion on the Coercion
Bill, under which martial law was proclaimed
in W. Q. Boodlewraith, hopeless of passing
the Bill in any other way, gagged, choked, and
throttled debate. The Speaker, the Chairman
of Committees, and the Acting-Chairman—all
red-hot supporters of the Government party —
crushed out opposition; and the mental condition
in which some of them were when “ presiding”
provoked even Brisbane Courier —a solid sup-
porter of the Government —to say that they
should not be permitted to preside again.
Chief Justice Griffith, in hearing the case,
first of all excluded all evidence of what took
place prior to Browne’s expulsion ; thus saving
the Government from an exposure of the dis-
creditable proceedings of its Acting-Chairman
of Committees. After much ingenious argu-
ment, the Judge held that, as the Speaker was
merely carrying out the will of the majority of
the House, based on a standing order confirmed
by the majority of the House, no action could
lie against him in the Supreme Court. If there
was any error of procedure, then the House
itself was the judge of procedure, without
appeal. Should this decision be sustained, it
simply means that a minority of members of Q.
Legislative Assembly have no Parliamentary
rights whatever as against a majority, which
may silence them, or exclude them from the de-
liberations of the House for as long as it chooses,
on the ground of contumacy. Contumacy may
mean any kind of opposition to the wishes of
the majority ; the majority are sole judges of
what is contumacy; they execute their own
sentence by passing a majority resolution with-
out debate, and without hearing the accused in
his defence ; and there is no appeal from their
decision. If this is constitutional law in
Queensland The Bulletin pities Queensland.
The whole case, by the w r ay, affords another
illustration of the rottenness of the system
which permits crooked-minded and unjudicial
Australian politicians to appoint themselves to
the Bench—as Griffith practically appointed
himself. When Griffith was Premier he was
identified with the gang which abolished,
in one act, Browne’s rights as a member
of Parliament ; he was warmly opposed by
Browne’s party ; and the Attorney-General
(who conducted the prosecution) was his col-
league and nominee. The Bulletin does not
believe that Chief Justice Griffith was con-
sciously influenced by any of these things ; but
no man can entirely divest himself of engrained
prejudices. The nett result, however, is that
Chief Justice Griffith is exceedingly unfit to
preside over such cases as that of Browne v.
Cowley ; since, however he might decide, the
public faith in the purity of the justice which
he dispenses is lessened or destroyed by the
knowledge of his political history and predi-
lections. ,
The Crushed Victorian Selector.
A Victorian writes to The Bulletin as fol-
lows :—The Vic. Lands Minister is now trying
to collect the rents owing to the State, and, as
might be expected from a too tardy action,
there is some uproar. In good times, selectors
were allowed to evade their liabilities to the
State; but, now that the Treasurer has a
deficit, the arrears are being called in. It was
a criminal mistake to allow the arrears to accu-
mulate, and it is equally a mistaken policy to
expect four or five years’ rent from selectors at
the close of a disastrous season. Irvine,
M.L.A., has his scheme to meet the difficulty.
Callinan, Surveyor-General, has his scheme ;
and the Argus also has a scheme. is strange
that these people cannot or will not see the
great, if not the sole, difficulty farmers are
laboring under. Every farmer can see it; but,
of course, farmers’ opinions do not count.
High-priced money is the sore point. The dear-
ness of money has been gradually swamping the
farmersuntiltheir heads are hardly above water.
As a result some of the most energetic of the
Vic. farmers are determined upon giving up the
struggle and leaving the land to the mortgagees.
I say, advisedly, the most energetic ; for, in
many districts, these people are in the greatest
difficulties. When districts were first broken
up, some of the selectors were idlers, while
others were energetic. The former borrowed
all they could on their land, and many had to
sell in theboom-time. Their moreenergetic neigh-
bors who had clear selections became purchasers,
and mortgaged their own land as well as the
selections they bought in order to raise the pur-
chase-money. Then came evil days : poor re-
turns, low prices, high interest; and the result
is that the flower of Victorian settlers are being
slowly ruined, chiefly by the heavy interest.
The cautious plodders, who were content with
what they had, are fairly able to meet their
liabilities. Mr. Irvine would make all this
right by deducting sixpence an acre from rents.
Such a concession is worthless, and only shows
the pettiness of the proposer. Callinan’s
plan is equally useless as a present remedy, and
the Argus remedies are Argus remedies. Even
purblind statesmen should see the remedy ; for if
any question was ever fully discussed in Victoria,
that of obtaining “ cheap money for farmers ”
on Credit Foncier lines was. Patterson saw
that it was popular ; but knavery, imbecility,
or both, prevented his Government from giving
it a fair chance; and so a scheme for the recon-
struction of the Savings Banks was brought
forward instead. The result was a fiasco. The
Turner Government preferred to get a commis-
sion to inquire into the workings of a State Bank,
&c. After resting for months, the Commiss >u
begins to examine experts who admit that Limy
do not know what a Slate Bank is. Yet six
weeks at most would bring a copy of Balfour’s
Irish Laud Purchase Act to Melbourne ; and
I venture to say that there is more valuable
information in that Act about “ money
for farmers,” than the Banking Commission
will ever collect from the high-salaried nonen-
tities they are examining. Balfour’s Act
modified would suit this province. The financ-
ing of the measure was done by Goschen,
and it was approved by Gladstone and all the
other authorities on finance in the House of
Commons. The objections to the Act from
the Irish tenants’ point of view were
that it was not made compulsory on
the landlords to sell, and consequently
the benefits it conferred on tenants were
confined to those whose landlords did actually
sell under it. Under the Act, £33,000,000 was
made available for the purpose of buying out
Irish landlords. The money was borrowed at
2| per cent, and lent to tenants at 4 per cent.
Of the difference of 1£ per cent., 1 per cent, was
put into a sinking-fund to pay off the whole
debt in 49 years, and the remaining J per cent,
was put into an insurance-fund to provide
against bad debts. The Vic. Government could
get money at per cent, and could lend it at
5 per cent. Of the 1J per cent, difference, 1
per cent, could go into a sinking-fund, to pro-
vide for paying off the principal, and the
remaining \ per cent, would be ample for the
purpose of meeting expenses and establishing a
fund to provide against losses, provided the
business were given over to a couple of com-
petent managers, who would be made directly
responsible for the administration of the scheme.
To my knowledge, Balfour’s Act has been a
success in Ireland wherever it was put in
operation. It should be signally successful in
Victoria. In conclusion, I shall only point out
that selectors in the hands of mortgagees see
before them no hope of ever paying off the prin-
cipal, or even continuing to meet the exorbitant
interest, consequently they are despondent.
Give them an opportunity through this scheme,
and despondency will yield to hope and courage.
The result will be such an impetus to produc-
tion, and to business generally, that deficits
will disappear and solid prosperity reign.—

Premier Turner’s Programme.
Next session the Victorian Government pro-
poses to attack three important reforms, and if
they can be effected the Turner Ministry will
have deserved well of the country, and the
Premier, if ejected at next general election,
can go back to the police courts and defend the
agile horse-thief with a light heart. A new
Companies Act is to be introduced which will,
it is alleged, make it impossible in the future
for “ unscrupulous directors and others to rob
the public.” If the Act is wide enough and
brainy enough to effect this purpose, it will be
the greatest reform which Victoria has enjoyed
for many years. Premier Turner is a serious,
practical man with much hard sense and
an immense capacity for detail, and he is
probably better qualified to draft the sort
of measure required than any other Australian
politician now in office. Whether he has
courage enough to do the work properly, or
whether he really wants to do it properly, or
whether the Legislature will allow him to do it,
will probably be known within the next three
months. In any case, the Bill is interesting as
an official acknowledgment that the Victorian
public has been robbed in the past by unscrupu-
lous directors to an extent which calls for
strong legislative measures, and is an indirect
acknowledgment that a good many people
ought to be in gaol who aren’t there. The
Purification of Rolls Act, which has served
no purpose worth mentioning except to
cause the wholesale disfranchisement of
voters principally Democratic voters is
to be abolished, and in its stead
the Government has devised u hat it believes to
be the simplest and most equitable system of
registration yet adopted in Australia. Con-
sidering that the Turner Government is largely
dependent on the Democratic vote this measure
will probably be shoved along with all the force
of the Ministerial party. Also a bill is to be
introduced compulsorily extending the blessings
of the Eight-hour system to the Chinese furni-
ture-maker—the leper who now works with
hands and feet and teeth for 70 hours a week,
and thereby turns out his goods at a rate
which has driven the white cabinet-maker out
of the trade. Other measures promised are a
new Insolvency Act which, it is hoped, will
exercise a salutary influence on the fraudulent
trustee, and the friendly bogus debtor, and the
man who secretly compounds for one fink in
the £; and a Sugar Guarantee Act, on the
Queensland system, to encourage the local beet-
industry. It is not, on the whole, a very large
programme, though it is quite large enough ;
and if these five proposals get safely through,
and are anything like up to the alleged sample,
the Turner Government will deserve another
year’s trial, anyhow.
“ Within the Meaning of the Act.”
The decision of the New South Wales Full
Court in a recent liquor-adulteration case is
calculated to fill the public with amazement at
the law’s boundless capacity for keeping clear
of anything resembling ordinary horse-sense.
In this instance, a police-inspector bought and
paid for a flask of brandy in the usual fashion,
and the liquor, on analysis, proved to be such
a fraudulent compound that a bench of
magistrates promptly fined the vendor .£lO.
Then that person (was the Licensed Victuallers’
Association behind him ?) appealed, and the
result of his appeal is one more proof that the
law can find a way to make an ass of itself out
of the most unpromising materials. The Full
Court decided that a sale to an inspector for
purposes of analysis wasn’t a sale “within the
meaning of the Act.” The law provides for the
punishment of anyone selling bogus liquor, but
the Court holds, in effect, that a sale, to be
a sale, must mean disposing of the liquor to
some one who intends using it for ordinary
drinking purposes. Under this ruling it will,
of course, be practically impossible to show
that the liquor was bought for actual drinking
purposes, unless the buyer proves his honajidets
by drinking it, and when he has drunk the
liquor it is beyond the reach of analysis. In
short, the law, as now interpreted, stands
somewhat as follows : It is provided by the
statute that anyone selling bogus liquor shall
be punished. An officer is appointed for the
purpose of sampling and inspecting liquor.
This officer, however, if he is to do any good in
his calling, must not buy any liquor himself for
purposes of analysis, nor must he send anyone
else to buy it. In fact, it must not be bought
for the purpose for which it is intended at all.
If the liquor is bought for analysis then
the seller can’t be prosecuted. The only
chance, therefore, is to wait until sohie
casual person, who bought liquor for
drinking purposes only, is so roused
to fury by the unspeakable quality of the drink
that he will lodge a complaint. As very few
people know good liquor from bad, a sufficiently
casual person will not be met with more than
once in 12 months or so—perhaps once in 20
years. When he is met with, it must happen
that he didn’t swallow his drink on the spot,
but took it away with him. Also, that he took
it away with a pure mind and a guileless soul—
if he swallows one poisonous “ nip ” at the
counter, and its quality makes him buy and
take away with him another for purposes of
further inspection, then the latter transaction
is not a sale “ within the meaning of the Act.”
Further that, having in a perfectly casual
manner, and with no after-intent, pur-
chased and taken away the liquor, with-
out sealing it up, or having brought
anyone with him for the purposes of testifying to
the purchase, he must still be able to prove that
it is the same liquor which he bought, or that
he bought any liquor at all. Also he must be
able to Drove that he was wholly and entirely
casual all through the transaction. Not one
purchaser in 100,000 can legally prove anything
of the kind, so that if the amazing decision of
the Full Court holds good it is hardly likely
that any more sellers of poisonous liquor will be
convicted in New South Wales. Under these
circumstances, The Bulletin desires to ask
the aforesaid Full Court one question : The
inspector asked for a flask of liquor ; it was
handed over to him and paid for in the ordinary
course; and the Court—the sensible Judge
Innes alone dissenting—has decided that
the transaction wasn’t a “sale.” Then what
was it, and (another pertinent question) wherein
was any injustice done to the publican by the
manner in which he was induced to part with
his liquor? The Supreme Court decision gives
a license-to-poiaon to every ruffian included in
the roll of N.S.W. licensed publicans; and
further handicaps the decent grog-vendors still
stumping along the uphill track of honesty.
One reason assigned by New South Wales Full
Court for its astonishing decision in the recent
Sydney drink-adulteration case was that the
Act didn’t define the meaning of the word
“sale.” If the Court applied this same
learned but ineffably stupid system all round,
nobody would ever be convicted of anything.
For instance, a man is hanged for wilfully
causing the death of another man ; will the
Full Court discharge every convicted murderer
until some one fixes up, in the criminal
code, an accurate definition of death, which
nobody has ever yet been able to define?
When the Land-tax comes into force, can
it be legally collected, according to the Full
Court, unless the Act accurately defines
the meaning of the word “laud?” There is no
possible definition except that land is a sub-
stance, whose component parts have been
elaborately ticketed by chemistry, and these
parts are supposed to have come from some
place not ascertained, and to have been made
out of something or nothing, at an undiscover-
able date, by some power whose address isn’t
on record, and which is best known by the fact
that many people have been killed for not
holding the same views concerning it as many
other people. Even if the Adulteration Act
did define the meaning of a “sale” beyond
all question, would things be much further
advanced, according to the logic of the
Full Court, unless there was also a suffi-
cient definition of an Act, so that the
Full Court could be dead-sure that the Adultera-
tion Act was an Act at all ? That Act is pre-
sumably a certain decision, arrived at according
to certain forms, by the men of New South
Wales, and New South Wales is a certain piece
of an undefinable substance called land, and no
one knows what man is, except that his niaterial
part is about 141 b. of ash and five buckets of
water, and that Mrs. Mellon attempted to
raise his spiritual or terial or hazy or gaseous
or invisible part, or the part which isn’t
shoved into the ground when he is dead, in
the presence of Judge Windeyer, and made a
very unconvincing display in consequence. The
mo'ral of all which is that no one can define
anything except by saying that it is made
directly or indirectly out of something else
which is undefinable, and if the Full Court is
going to follow its recent decision to its logical
conclusion it can’t even define itself sufficiently
well to enable it to do any business whatever.
A little more ordinary common sense and a
little less definition would do a lot to expedite
law proceedings, not only in Australia, but in
most other places besides.
In Melb. Supreme' Court, last week, Justice
Williams considered the action of a lower
Court in dismissing an information against one
Michael Healy. Bookmaker Healy had been
charged with using the Victorian Club, Melb.,
for the purpose of betting, contrary to section
51 of the Police Offences Act. Two inform-
ants called at the club, and asked for Mr.
Healy, who came out on the staircase and
booked wagers with them, in defiance of section
51 ; yet the magistrates dismissed the case.
Justice Williams decided that the magis-
trates were right, and discharged the
order for a review of their judgment,
with costs. The Victorian Club, as far
as Justice Williams knows it, may be
a place where bookmakers meet for prayer. Its
notoriety as a betting establishment goes for
nothing. The press publication of Victorian
club odds doesn’t count. “ No evidence was
tendered to show that the place in question was
used as a place for betting, and it was for the
magistrates to say whether the mere fact that
the defendant made two bets there at wide
intervals of time was sufficient to constitute a
use of that place for betting purposes. He
agreed with the magistrates that it was
not. If it had been Droved that the
club was formed for betting purposes,
and that the defendant had used it on four or
jive occasions for those purposes, he would have
said the magistrates were wrong.” This sort of
law isn’t dealt out to the nominal tobacconist
who bets with a “ fizgig ” policeman in plain
clothes, remember. He gets lined at once.
Nobody proves that he opened his shop for
bookniaking purposes. The law takes quite a
common-sense view of section 51 until it is used
for the purpose of suppressing betting, rather
than prosecuting certain men for making bets.
Then the law invariably discovers that the in-
fringement of the Act isn’t proved. The law
doesn’t blush for its own humbug, either. It
merely winks its other eye at the ceiling and
murmurs, “dismissed with costs.” By the
way, who pays costs in this particular farce ?
The retrenching Government?
It was proposed, in the excitement of last week,
that among other baits to catcli New South
Wales distracted public opinion Parkes should,
in his wolf-hunger for office, dangle a promise
to reconsider the question of State aid to deno-
minational education. The proposal was not
adopted during the presentation of his censure
speech, and the prospects of advantage from
the “dangle” are sufficiently unsubstantial to
justify a prompt rejection of the hint; but to
Parkes no suggestion comes amiss, and once he
realises that the advocacy of State aid to edu-
cation will lift him a step up towards the
Premiership, his whole career warrants the
assumption that he will embrace the opportunity.
Thus he will complete another of those circles
which politicians who live long are so
given to describe. James Martin, David
Buchanan and Henry Parkes were the head
and front of the first Protectionist band in
New South Wales. Parkes is now, at 80 years
of age, practically back in the old fortress, a
few cobwebby verbal distinctions being all he
carries to cover his Freetrade nakedness. He
began life similarly as the advocate of denomi-
uatioualism ; he fought vigorously against the
James Greenwoods and other secularising
powers of his time, to finally adopt the sub-
stance of their platform and dethrone denomi-
nationalism ; and what principle of his life
now stands in the way of his trying to restore
denominationalism, under the new guise of
payment by results ? When those who want
this can guarantee Parkes a Parliamentary
majority of one, the history of the old man’s
life gives proof that he will be with them.
Dear Bulletin, —Your par. re Vic. married
telegraph-messenger “boys” reminds me that
there is a similar anomaly in the N.S. Wales
railway-service. In that department there is a
grade of junior or boy-porters supposed to be of
any age between 15 and 21, who are paid at a
rate varying between 2s. 6d. and ss. per day,
and are supposed to receive appointments as
adult porters on becoming 21. But lately there
have been few vacancies to be filled, and there
are a great many “ boys ” of 25 years awaiting
promotion. Many are married and have fami-
lies ; my mate is 24 and supports a wife and
two children on ss. per day. The anomaly
works greater injustice to the railway-men
than to the telegraph people. The junior
porter under 21 is not allowed to work signals
and is not criminally liable if his mistake leads
to loss of life ; the junior over 21 is both de-
partmentally and criminally liable. It is
too late to say the standard of living should
not be reduced—it has been reduced ; now you
should say how it can be raised.— Railway
man. N.S.W., 16th May, 1895.
S. M. Herald, writing of Prof. Morris’s Higin-
botham memoir, sneerfully and triumphantly
asks; “What has he (Higinbotham) done?”
Like all the world’s great teachers, he preached,
and practised what he preached. Only that
and nothing more He preached—preached
Democracy, and practised it ! He gave to
Australia the whole gospel of popular Govern-
ment, and his life was an object-lesson in demo-
cratic citizenship. Subtract him from the roll
of Australian political history, and what
remains is chiefly a bevy of titled time-servers.
To say he was unpractical is no depreciation ;
for, if Higinbotham was unpractical, then in-
corruptible honesty is also unpractical. But the
charge is not true, any more than it is true that
he was a failure. It was the Democracy that
failed. It drew back from his noble yet
realisable ideal. Even if he did fail in any-
thing. he knew
. . . How far high failure
O'erleaps the bounds of low success.
And the Democracy is immeasurably richer for
his failures than for the successes of the mob of
popular mischievous mediocrities. The prin-
ciples he expounded were those of eternal
truth ; his adherence to them, his whole per-
sonality, stands imperishably fixed, a model for
the honest to imitate ; a measure whereby to
estimate, to condemn and to humiliate the
political traitor, timeserver, pigmy and
poltroon.

Avery short season of “Dorothy” com-
menced at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday, when
Miss Nellie Stewart made another conspicuous
success in‘ the character of sweet Dorothy Bantam.
The play which is built around her has no very
remarkable features—it is a pleasant and tuneful
affair, and that’s about all—but Dorothy is a
loveable little maid, and the average audience is
mashed on her to thelast man. Miss Florence Young,
who improves every day, took her old part of Lydia
Hawthorne with more success than heretofore,
and when these two ladies and Miss Pollard were
turned on together to sing their trio, “ Be Wise
in Time,” the audience got as much solid joy for
its money as any audience could -expect. At the
same time, it looks like gross extravagance to turn
on Nellie Stewart and Florence Young at the same
time: it is very much like drinking out of two
bottles at once. Lurcher, in the solid flesh of
George Lauri, was wholly satisfactory ; and Wal-
lace Brownlow and Tapley may be set down as
ditto, the latter being the more ditto of the two.
The audience always regards Joseph with con-
sideration as the iiushand of Vi. Varley, even
when he has only to stand round and fix his bale-
ful eye on somebody, but his song, “Though born
a man of high degree,” would have evoked ap-
plause even if that charmer had rejected his suit
and married a man named Higgins. “The Vicar
of Bray” is on the bill till Friday, and “Ma Mie
Rosette ” follows.
* * * *
Frederic Yilliers, the war “special,” has
done his brief season in Sydney, and leaves a
pleasant impression behind him. The Centenary
Hall was crowded on the night of his opening
lecture, though that tall, thin building, which
looks as if it had not got enough to eat when it
was young, was not the best kind of structure for
the purpose. The pillars blocked the view of the
pictures considerably, and from some parts only
the gaiters of the lecturer were visible. Mr.
Yilliers lectured in his campaigning suit, instead
of in the Cimmerian tail-coat of an effete civilisa-
tion, and thereby economised his wash-bill con-
siderably. The costume was generally approved
of; even if he had lectured in his night-shirt it
would have been a pleasant change from the
conventional dicky and bone-stud. As far as
can be guessed from his utterances, Mr.
Yilliers is not a humorist on a large scale,
and he makes no pretence of being one.
He tells his plain, unvarnished tale in a
straightforward manner, and illustrates it with
many convincing views of Japanese and other
scenery, and though there is not much in his tale
that has not been heard already, yet the illustra-
tions compensate for any deficiencies. In his
opening lecture he only dropped into a mirthful
mood twice—once regarding a mule and once in
the matter of a dead horse. Also, he dropped
once into profound pathos when he described the
massacre at Port Arthur, and his pathetic voice
proved to be very like his humorous voice, and his
ordinary business voice was exactly the same as
both of them. Probably his utterance has lost its
flexibility through altercations with many camel-
drivers in different climes, and through arguing with
mules and dromedaries. Summed up, the famous
special is a useful and agreeable adjunct to the
pictures ; he is a wiry-looking man of no swearable
age, with a serviceable pair of legs, a pronounced
English drawl, a bright eye, and a habit of going
straight at his subject. He begins without any
dreadful preliminary joke about the beautiful har-
bour ; he is judiciously reticent about the great
people of his acquaintance, and doesn’t talk about
himself more than is necessary; and when he is
finished he goes straight away without any perora-
tion. Altogether, The Bulletin views Smythe’s
latest acquisition with feelings of respect.

At Sydney Royal Miss Maggie Moore has
relapsed into Irish drama, and this week “ Arrah-
na-Pogue” and “ Colleen Bawn ” have been turn-
ing up alternately. The man doesn’t live who
could say anything new about these hoary dramas,
and the only thing which is visibly new about the
cast is that Mr. H. R. Roberts is steadily develop-
ing a rich and powerful brogue, and that Mr.
West is about the most comprehensively villain-
ous-looking informer on record. A week of
“ Struck Oil ” comes next, and on June Ist the
Irish element reappears with “Sweet Innisfail.”
The present, by the way, isn’t a good time for
Irish drama ; it should be put on in the summer,
when it is possible to spend a night behind a hedge
with a gun waiting for the landlord without catch-
ing rheumatism.
* * * *
Her Majesty’s also falls into Irish drama
on Saturday, when Mr. Charles Erin Verner,
“ the greatest Irish comedian of the age,” appears
in “ Shamus O’Brien.” This rush of Irish drama
is unaccountable.
* * * *
A grand new skating ballet has been added
to the programme at Sydney Tivoli, which pro-
gramme keeps expanding to such a degree that
some day the buttons will inevitably fly off at the
back. The other feature on the bill is that Harry
Rickards, and his wonderful hat, and his other
appurtenances, leave for London on June 10 in
search of new talent, and the date of his return is
uncertain.
* * * *
Another minstrel co,, under the manage-
ment of Messrs. York and Jones, has opened the
Opera House, and hopes, with the hope that
keeps alive despair, to run those roman-starred
premises successfully. The new co, is a
tolerably respectable affair, and if Sydney really
wants a second variety show, and the public can be
induced to climb up the interminable stairs of the
old house in York-street, and the programme
keeps up to the first night’s standard, all may be
well with the venture.
Melbourne’s theatrical carnival, inaugur-
ated last year at a muddy crioket-ground, is to
take place in the Exhibition building this time.
Wednesday next is the appointed day, and the
programme prepared for the occasion carries its
own recommendation with it, apart from charit-
able considerations. The public are not humbly
petitioned to assist distressed actors. They are
merely invited to patronise a huge show provided
by professional brethren of the distressed ones
aforesaid. It may be mentioned, all the same,
that the profits of these bona fide benefits are
devoted to chanty, and not to “organisation.”
The cost of distributing the cash is less than one
per cent., and of every shilling paid for a ticket of
admission something like lid. goes to a good
cause.
* * * *
The Melbourne theatres have mostly been
content to go on and prosper, as before, since
they were last observed by The Bulletin. “ In
Town ” is still crowding the Princess’s, but the
charm of that stupendous success was lessened on
Saturday night by the absence, through illness, of
Charles Ryley. The Duke of Muffshire who ap-
peared in Ryley’s stead was a hard, unsympathetic
duke, and when he contributed a touch of senti-
ment the show seemed to recoil, as though shrink-
ing from contact with a cold foot. “ In Town ”
will end on Friday, and “The Shop Girl,” with
Harry Monkhouse in a leading part, is due upon
the following night. “ The Shop Girl,” according
to present threats, can only run for one consecu-
tive week, after which George Edwardes’s com-
pany—whose all-round ability becomes more glar-
ingly apparent every night—will leave Melbourne,
never, or hardly ever, to return.
“ The Span of Life ” continues to bridge
the chasm of weekly exes, at Melb. Royal, and
manager Bland Holt has no weak ambition to put
up another drama before his tuft of profit on the
Saturday side of the precipice has been fairly worn
away by grabbing at it. The baby camel fell sick
recently, whereupon baby’s humpy parent ob-
jected to crossing the desert alone, and tried to
shove a few Arab sheiks into the orchestra. Other-
wise, the course of Bland Holt’s panorama has
been running smooth.
** * *
The Rickards Cos. warbles to packed
benches. Two American artists, Murphy and
Mack, are to make their first Australian appear-
ance at the Opera House on Saturday, when the
surplus audience will probably require to be
driven back with hand-spikes. A. hand-spike at
this establishment is the only possible alternative
to a summons for overcrowding. Frank Clark s
variety show at the Bijou had a fairly spccessful
first week, and the programme is improving
steadily. Also the Cambridge has struck another
double bill which is distinctly than the
previous effort, and D’Arcy Stanfield’s intelligent
humor gets two good opportunities to score.
** * *
Clifford Halid, son of Sir Charles of that
ilk, will deliver lectures upon the art of singing,
at Melb. Athenaeum Hall, on four evenings next
week. Mr. Halid’s grip of his subject is said to
be strong, and, as an entertainer, he brings a
reputation from India, together with a lady
vocalist, of whom more anon. Just now, when
every second damsel in Melbourne is training her
squeak with a view to European triumphs, a word
of wisdom from a Halle should be very welcome.
** * *
Percy Grainger, the 12-year-old pianist>
has been packed off to Germany by his Melbourne
friends. He gave an astonishing farewell per-
formance at the Town Hall (where the ladies
bombarded him with chrysanthemums), and left no
room for doubt that he ought to make a stir in the
world hereafter. Percy is by this time a painful
little prig. Most spoilt boys of his class require an
occasional basting to keep them up to the mark.
Having found out that they are clever they don’t
want to learn any more. Child Percy regards
himself as a marvellously gifted father to the man
Grainger, who must stick close to his music if he
intends to give his offspring a good start in life.
That’s genius of a sort. Juvenile faith is the
future reward of industry. One smirking youngster
thinks “ I’m a bright boy,” and stops at that ;
but the other kid thinks —“ What shall Ibe like
presently if I practise my talents eight hours a
day!” Percy Grainger would practise himself to
death if his* mother did not lure him from the
piano at stated times, and induce him to study his
health. Then he rushes out into the fresh air to
gain the strength necessary for thumping the keys
some more. With luck he may become another
Paderewski.
At Melbourne Exhibition, on the twenty-ninth of
May,
Good pros, of all degrees
Have volunteered to please
The pleasure-seeking public, who can well afford
to pay
A coin of modest worth
For the “ biggest show on earth.”
A band of choice musicians, under Marshall Hall,
will play
Selections through the day,
Whilst other musio-hall-ers lend a willing
Aid, with songs and dances duly stated in the list.
Then, underneath the dome
The newest stars from ’Ome
With recitations, comedies, and sketches will
assist
To keep the game alive,
And Ouda takes a dive
From the roof into a netting (just imagine—if he
missed !) —
And the growlers who insist
On getting ample value for a shilling,
Will not be disappointed if a moment they can
snatch
To see the fun outside,
Where the damsels sit astride
Their patent safety bicycles, and scud away from
scratch,
Or otherwise compete
In races short and sweet.
Not least of the attractions is a costume football
match ;
Apart from these a batch
Of entertainments humorous or thrilling,
And a sale of dolls at auction to delight the kiddies
small,
Will help to fill the bill.
Down, flutterer ! Be still
Whilst we speak about a matter which is richest
of them all
In the rapture it affords,
“The Beauties of the Boards ”
Have agreed to sell refreshments in a perfume-
laden hall.
O, when their glances fall
On a johnnie the effect is very killing.
Ten thousand hearts are craving for admission to
a tent
Where angels fair and bright,
Ever gracious and polite
To the most suspicious matron, or the baldest
headed gent,
Will sweeten cup of tea,
In the cause of charitee,
By smiling at the “ sugar ” which a customer has
spent.
And this glorious event
Will be offered to the public at a shilling—
Vide billing.
On the 29th of May
This remarkable array
Of talent will do honor to the actor old and gray,
Of a long-forgotten day,
Also younger ones who cannot keep the yelping
wolf away.
And a ticket may be purchased for a shilling.
At Poverty Point.
Dear Bulletin,— Re a recent par. Melb. bald-heads,
discussing Gaietv Girlhood, may plump for Maud Hobson
(who isn’t plump, but bonily-large) ; johnniedom may
elect the Palotta ; the “ gods ” may vote for Florence
Lloyd ; d.c. (which seldom stands for “ discerning")
maidens may admire Blanched Massey and Decimal
Moore; but all have failed to discover the finest girl of
the imported crowd. For symmetrical, upstanding figure,
shapely—er—continuations of the foot, pretty face and
sparkling expression, Ethel Carlton, boss nymph of the
chorus, and “ the housekeeper ” in the first act of
“In Town,” is first past the post, and all pro-
tests are dismissed. She’s understudy for more
than one of the principals, and if she gets the chance
to linger for more than a few too transient seconds on the
stage, the great combined heart of Melbourne’s bald-
headedness, johnniedom, “gods,” and d.c. maidenhood
will rise and sing the name of “ Ethel" down the ringing
grooves of artistic appreciation. She wears pink tights
in the greenroom of “In Town,” and already one prin-
cipal lady has gone back into skirts, while another would
also hide her “ pillars ” were she not representing a male
character at the “Ambiguity.” If Miss Carlton were to
play Tybalt for one night, that bit of sword rehearsal
might be serious enough to justify the horrified inter-
vention of the Rev. Leedham Bantock Hopkins.—Yours,
Bull’s Eye. [The Bulletin hopes that the gentleman,
having got this off his chest, now feels much better. The
Court, having listened to argument on behalf of the afore-
said lady in pink tights, is now prepared to hear learned
counsel for the lady in yellow tights.]
Tub Bulletin’s old friend, George Leitch, the most
famous Insect of “ Paul Jones,” is In Sydney endeavoring
to get up a first-class dramatic co. for a long tour in
Maoriland and elsewhere. Mr. Leitch has a new pro-
duction on hand which is expected to make a boom, and
his friends—which term includes almost everybody—wish
him every possible luck.
Monkhouse ought to have accepted Ryley’s part, and
made a lot of it, instead of being out of sight out of mind.
At “In Town,” the other evening, a “fashionable”
party occupied a box. The behaviour of the ladies was
so extraordinary that it almost interfered with the per-
formance. They laughed and talked loudly and made
signs to the actors with their handkerchiefs. At last the
amphitheatre was moved to wrath, and requested loudly
that the party should be “chucked out.” Things are
hardly less bad in the dress-circle of Sydney Lyceum,
where, especially on first nights, the cackle of a number
of well-dressed people is absolutely unendurable—yet has
to be endured. But why has it?
Cabled that Brenda Gibson, formerly of the Brough*
Boucicault co., has been engaged by Henry Irving for an
English and American season. Both parties are to be
felicitated.
Max O’Rell talks to interviewers of throwing burly
bushmen out of certain of his Australian audiences. We
can hardly believe Max would let a man off so easily once
he had him in the hall.
R. S. Smythe has yet another chip of the old block. A
younger brother of Carlyle looked after Haweis’s door in
Melbourne while Pa and Carlyle were away. Much
Travelled, More Travelled, Most Travelled.
Joe Brown, the inspired entrepreneur who first con-
ceived the immortal idea of showing a bullock-team on
the stage, is Clark’s manager at Melb. Bijou.
The Gaiety Co. are due in Adelaide on Saturday, Ist
June. They stop a week.
Dear Bulletin,— Touching some recent “Poverty-
Point” pars. Firstly, Miss Florence Young isn’t likely
to go to London in search of an engagement, and her
place in the Firm’s comic-opera co. will not be taken by
Miss Orelli, neither is there any foundation for the latter
portion of the report. Secondly, a comparison between
the aforesaid Firm’s profits from the present “Gaiety
Co.” and “ the Leslie-Lonnen Co.’s” is absurd, because
the Lonnen crowd came out under engagement to George
Musgrove, when he was running Melb. Opera House apart
from Williamson and Garner. Thirdly, what “success at
the Gaiety ” does Maud Hobson owe to the fact that she
is “the niece of John Holllngshead ” T Unole, if he be
her unole, never gave Miss Maud a chance to show her
ability as an actress. She merely adorned the chorus
when Holllngshead had the Gaiety. Fourthly, Miss Pa-
lotta's cry of “ Oh Sharley 1” in “ A Gaiety Girl ” was not
at all heart-broken, but essentially cheerful and coquet-
tish, and untrue to the character she played.—Yours,
Oouaii Drop.
From Melb. Bijou advt.: “ The management will at all
times be obliged to have pointed out any departure from
good taste on the part of anyone engaged on the stage.”
A small child singing a song with a cerulean verse in it is
a departure from good taste, we’re thinking.
While the beauteous Carmencita, the Spaidsh dancer,
was appearing at the Palace Theatre (Lon.) she presented
the musical conductor with a gorgeous diamond ring.
Alfred Plumpton was the conductor in question. The
women seemingly admire Plumpton as much as ever.
One wouldn’t think it to look at him, but they do.
Miss Grace Palotta is a married lady, doncherknow.
The night Mrs. Lewis played Hamlet, there was a large
trapeze hung from the ceiling in readiness for Frank
Olafk’s Co. the following night. During the too-long
dreariness of the melancholy Dane, the “gods" often im-
patiently asked when she was going to do the trapeze act.
That charming Melb. girl, Lalla Miranda, studying
under Madame Richard, made her dMmt in Paris, singing
from Gounod’s “ Romeo et Juliette." European critics
credit her with the possession of remarkable quality and
clearness of voice,'likening it to the true nightingale
tones of the Van Zandt and Melba order. Continental
connoisseurs pronounced the “ glistening-eyed ” a beauty;
so, doubtless, with such hall-marks of approval she will
one day stand on a high rung of the operatic ladder.
Dear 8.,— “Baldy ” wants the “serio-comic” banished
from the stage. We can tolerate the “ serio-comic ” for
a little longer, but, for heaven’s sake, banish the baby,
girl who is hoisted on to the star’s knee and asked pointed
questions in unmelodious doggerel, answers to which are
squeaked by the infant at short intervals.—Yours, Heart
and Head.
Pro.: “ What an encouragement for hard-working
actresses to see the fuss over a raw chit of a girl like Ethel
Haydon—and she don’t catch on, either."
Itjwould tremendously surprise Southern johnnies to
learn the exact years of their present pretty favorite.
Tub Bulletin knows, but it’s not going to tell.
The “In Town” gag, “Oh, yes, she’s very French.
Her father and mother are to be married next week, and
she’s going to keep house for them,” has given much
offence to French people in Melbourne, who regard it as
a gratuitous and unwarranted insult to their country
which might well have been left behind in London.
Parson Haweis’s brother, a resident of Prahran, Vic.,
who was dangerously ill when the quaint little lecturer
arrived in Melb., has since died.
Grace Palotta’s new song in “In, Town” is a feeble
imitation of her “Gaiety Girl” ditty, and it lets the
public know that the young lady has, at present, only one
string to her bow. Palotta paralyses johnnies with her
graceful, saucy, “ foreign ” style, but as an actress she
weakens on acquaintance. When you have beard her say,
“If you can’t af -ford a han-som . . . fcrfcea’bus,” and
seen her romp off the stage, you have got at the full
strength of her artistic resources-up to now.
During a recent performance of “Hamlet” up South.
Hamlet: “Thus bad begins, but worse remains behind.”
Unfeeling person in the stalls: “ Oh, does it! Then here
goes.” And he left.
Many of “ The Shop Girl ” gags are very richly flavored
and will probably disagree with the palates of people who
are “ particular.” The piece is “ extremely up to date,”
and perhaps the management was wise in only giving it a
week’s run.
Wilfrid Shine was the only member of the profession
conspicuous at the Melb. reception of Davitt.
Ada Crossley’s London d6but is described by cable as a
brilliant success.
Captain Carrington, in “In Town,” neatly describes
tights as “ mere breeches of decorum.”
Blue-Tail Fly Barlow is trying to get his reminiscences
published in Melb.
George Edwardes engaged Courtneidge to play first man
in “ His Excellency ” on tour, and our old friend Rocco
is such a success that he leaves a trail of butter behind
him in the English provincial press.
The number of variety shows in Melb. made Tub Bulle-
tin predict a reversion to Sitakespeare. Here it is—Mrs.
G. B. Lewis playing Hamlet. This is the only heavy
Shakespearean part women ever try; but when the
New Woman has captured the drama, men will only be
allowed Yarmouth leg-shows, while Shylock, Lear, and
Macbeth will be feminine under the make-up. We should
like to see Bernard Beere in “ Othello ’’—she would be a
long way better than most of the male failures seen here.
In his annotated programme, Marshall Hall announced
that his “Giordano Bruno” overture was suggested by a
perusal of the life of that great free-thinker and
bigotry and superstition. Had the Professor been up-to-
date, he would have called it the Jos. Symes Overture.
When is Arthur Daere going to play “Jim, the Pen-
man " ?
Fleming Norton, who was for some time in Australia
under the auspices of “the Firm,” died in London the

“Owen Hall’s" latest musical comedy made a very
good d6but at Portsmouth—a kind of “trying it on
the dog.” He is appropriately assisted by a gentle-
man who chooses to be known as Mr. Risqu6, whose
lyrics, I can assure you, are quite in keeping with his
pen-name, says The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent. I fancy, unless alterations are made, the Licenser
of Plays will have something to say to the piece. Cissy
Grahame is running the show, which is so promising that
it will be brought to London almost immediately. Owen

Pinero’s insistence that Mrs. Pat. Campbell should play
the heroine in “ The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith ” has been
amply justified, says The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent, for she has made an enormous hit in the part. So
great indeed is her success, that Beerbohrn Tree, instead
of getting rid of her and the incubus of her big salary, has
made up his mind to claim her for her original part in
“ John k Dreams,” which is to be reproduced at the Hay-
market. But Mrs. Pat. can play badly when it suits her,
as George Alexander knows. Mrs. Pat. draws £7O a week.
Latimer, London Baptist parson, has just resigned,

Muriel Carr, one of the ladies brought out by the

dancer and has a pretty voice. In the way of training
she had the advantage of being understudy to Florence
St. John, of the Savoy Opera Co. Muriel Carr, unlike
the majority of those who have had any connection with
her, speaks with great affection of Florence St.J., whose
temper is usually described as “ a caution.” Miss Cart
joins Williamson and Musgrove’s Cinderella Co.
Amateur prima-donna Orelli was tempted to take pari
in an Easter concert at Ballarat, the stronghold of her

taub,” &c. Signorina Orelli, on the other hand, “scarcely
fulfilled the expectations of the audience.” No dainse 1
with a rich, pure voice could expect to “ knock ” a com-
munity which found anything “superb” in the tunefu
bleat of its own particular Flegeltaub.

Among his other “economies,” Premier Reid
promises to save £234,000 tor the year by knocking £25,000
off the interest on the public debt; reducing the annual
payment in redemption of the railway loan of 1867 from
£70,000 to £15,000 ; reducing the payments in redemption
of Treasury bills from £206,000 to £103,000 ; reducing the
payments on account of another railway loan from £75,000
to £37,500; and cutting down the naval tribute from
£37,000 to £24,000. The £25,000 off the public debt can
only be saved by a conversion operation, which is not yet
effected and which may not be successful, or by default-
ing ; and all the other “savings” can only be managed
by special Acts of Parliament, which Acts may not pass.
Moreover, £196,000 of the amount is not a saving at all,
but a mere shuffling of to-day’s liabilities on to posterity.
Most of Premier Reid's finance consists of shuffling the
burden on to posterity ; the balance is a simple process of
counting the fowls before the eggs are hatched.

The Royal Bank of Queensland, like several
other reconstructed institutions, is considering a scheme
for further re-arrangement of its affairs. The Royal
settled with its depositors in ’93 by issuing deposit re-
ceipts at 4J per cent., payable by instalments in ’9B, ’99,
1900 and 1901. Since then it has released all its current
accounts, repaid one-fourth of its Govt, deposits, and
one-half of the ’9B instalment of its ordinary deposits,
and it is now about to repay the second half of the
game instalment. In addition to this, its business
has shown remarkable steadiness in the last two much-
depressed years, and, besides paying regular divs., it
has made considerable additions to its reserve fund.
It now proposes to raise money by an issue of 4 per
cent, debentures, and pay off its remaining 4£ per
cent* deposits. This will make a considerable saving of
interest—probably to the extent of £3OOO per annum.
The money is to be obtained in London—wherein the un-
speakable pig-headedness of even the intelligent variety
of Australian financier glares forth conspicuously. If the
Royal of Queensland can raise money at 4 per cent, in
London, where it is but little known, it could raise it
quite as easily, and at the same rate, in Australia, where
is has earned the reputation of being—with the exception
of the Commercial of Sydney—the soundest and most
promising of the reconstructed banks, and where its
repute stands higher than that of one or two banks which
survived the ’93 crisis. There is so much money in
Australia crying aloud for some kind of reasonably safe
investment, that this slavish adherence to the old custom
of relying on British capital is unaccountable.
if the Royal of Queensland gets its money in
London at 4 per cent., on its own security, how will that
transaction look by which the B.N.Z. gave the same rate
of interest for its £2,000,000 with the guarantee of the
State thrown in ? The combined guarantee of the pro-
vince and the B.N.Z. was certainly a little better than
that of the province alone, and as Maoriland can float its
own loans at a good deal less than 3J per cent., that
famous £2,000,000 transaction now looks a most luckless
affair.
♦ ♦ * *
At the National Bank meeting, it was feelingly
remarked by the chairman -according to the newspaper
report—that “ the interest due and payable on deposits
for the past half-year was £IBO,OOO, which absorbed the
treater portion of the profits, and it would be a great
relief if a reduction in the rate of interest could now be
made.” This may, or may not, mean that the National
is beginning to regard it as a far-off possibility that it may
have to appeal to its depositors—after the manner of two
other Vic. institutions —for a reduction of interest, but if
the steady drop in the profits continues, it is evident that
a time will come when the National, like every other bank
in like circumstances, must do something. And an appeal
to the depositors would be the most probable device
under the circumstances. A reduction of even 10s. per
cent, would save £40,000 per annum, which would be a
material assistance. Tub Bulletin can lay its finger on
at least four other banks which will most likely make the
smie appeal for consideration by-and-hye. The number
of banks hasn’t materially diminished, those that died
being mostly institutions which did very little genuine
banking. The amount of business to be done, however,
has decreased probably 30 per cent, in the last few years ;
the rate of interest has fallen so much that this decline
means a drop of something like 60 per cent, in profits ;
and meanwhile the rate payable on deposits—owing to
the cast-iron reconstruction policy—has rather increased
than diminished. Every Australian “reconstruct” save
two shows a general downward tendency in profits, and
unless there is a big general revival there must some day
be a stampede for a second reconstruction which will be
not quite so unanimous as the stampede of 1893, but still
quite unanimous enough.

If the state of the share-market is any criterion,
the balance-sheet of the A.J.S. Bank next July will be

Melbourne papers mention joyfully that the
reduction of Savings Bank interest to 3 and 2 per cent, is
driving money out of that institution at the rate of about
BCOO per week, and forcing it into “ other channels of
investment.” Considering that the P.O. Savings Bank
could give the old 4 per cent, and still pay its way, the
reduction is an undisguised attempt to bulldoze the
working classes into trusting their money once more to
the old boom financiers, or else it is an effort to make
them buy up Murphy’s tenements at Elsteruwick, now in
the possession of Mirams’ old building society. In other
words, the Turner Government is restoring confidence
with a club.

The balance-sheet of the Bank of Australasia
appears in the advertising columns of this issue. The
net profit for the half-year ended 15th Oct, 94, is £45,734,
against £60,606 for the similar half-year of ’93. The
div., which was as high as 10 per cent, in 92, has gob
down by a steady descent to 6 per cent., and even that
absorbs £48,000, or £2266 more than the actual profit for
the six months, then by reducing the balance to credit of
profit and loss by that amount. Said balance is now
only £9641. The Australasia has made no addition to its
reserve fund (£800,000) since ’BB—the good old times of
12 per cent. div. Comparing its present position with
lhat of April ’9O, its note ciroulition has decreased by
£87,000 ; its d-posits by £700,000; its bills payable, &c.,
by nearly £390,000; miscellaneous advances by over
£1,700,000; investments by £270,000; loans at call and
short notice by £360,000 ; and the amount available for
distribution has fallen from £127,000 to £57,000. The
only important increase is in “cash on band, which
is £1,100,000 more than in ’9O. Considering that there
have been no reconstruction troubles in the case, these
figures—especially when compared with those of the
Union and B.N.S.'W.— suggest thatthissolidold institution
is suffering from too much conservatism in its business
methods.

The Equitable Permanent Benefit, Building,
Land and Savings Institution of Sydney (ye gods, what a
name !) shows what can be done, even in the worst times,
by a society which never attempts to bite off more than it
can conveniently chew. Up to date it has met all
demands; it has £107,000 of deposits and has refused
many more for want of means of investment; it has a
reserve-fund of £21,000, a contingency fund of £2055,
and, after paying its regular rate of interest on deposits
and shares, has £2500 profit on the year’s transactions.
Its assets, amounting to £214,000, are free from ail mort-
gage and encumbrance, and it has a bank balance of
£19,931, and £SOOO in N.S.W. Government securities. The
pity is that more building societies are not run on the
same careful lines.

The Vie. butter and cheese trade is in a state
approaching insurrection. According to a contract
entered inta by the Patterson Govt., the Agricultural
Department is bound to send all its shipments of butter
and cheese by the steamers of the two mail companies
only. The freight agreed upon is nearly 30 per cent,
higher than present current rates ; the companies are not
absolutely bound to find accommodation for all ship-
ments, and as the cargo which they fail to find space for
can’t, under the contract, be sent by other vessels, it must
deteriorate and accumulate charges in the stores until the
next opportunity for shipment; and the mail boats carry
to London only, so that the consignments (or Glasgow,
Liverpool and other ports have to bo transhipped and
additional freights incurred. This last provision makes
the Vic. farmer particular wrathy, as he might, but for
the contract, send his goods direct to these ports at much
lower freights than he now pays to London only. Many
tons of produce have gone bad on his hands through this
clumsy arrangement, and when its author next appeais to
the electors the smell thereof will rise up against him
like the accusing ghost of much lost butter come to
judgment.

The public debt of N.S.W. on 31st December,
1894, was £58,204,253, and the annual interest thereon
£2,205,620. The cheerful fact is also mentioned that the
province has lost over £3,100,000 in discounts, expenses of
floating loans, etc., and pays about £IIO,OOO interest on
this sum which it didn’t get, but which it will have to pay
back all the same.

The Australian Mutual Fire Insurance Co.’s
report shows that the premium income for the year end-
ing 31st March, 1895, was £29,416, and the yield from in-
vestments £5797; total, £35,213. The total profit was
£16,765, of which £4OOO goes to reserve, making it
£86,000 ; £2250 to contingency fund, making it £14,000 ;
£2OOO to shareholders ; and £7723 as bonus divided
between shareholders and policyholders. The direc-
tors have also resolved to capitalise £12,500 of the
contingency fund, which will raise the capital to
£25,000. This ingenious method of doubling the
capital will enable the shareholders in future to get as
much profit out of an 8 per cent. div. as they formerly did
out of one of 16 per cent., and 8 per cent, isn’t nearly so
suggestive of the bloated and grasping capitalist as the
other thing. Altogether, the Australian Mutual Fire Cos.
can pride itself on being a prosperous and remarkably
well-managed affair.

It is cabled that the City of Melbourne Bank
depositors decline to grant any reduction of interest
“until a full enquiry has been made into the affairs of
the bank.” Tub Bullbtin’s personal opinion is that, with
a reduction of deposit interest to 3 per cent., and no
inquiry whatever, the City has a good chance to
get through, and to become, many years hence, a
tolerably flourishing concern; but that, with a full
inquiry, it will have very little chance of any kind.
The Bulletin has always advocated full inquiry, but this
time it is not talking of what should be, but of what—so
far as it can see—really is in this particular case, as well
as in several others. Many a patient would give up the
ghost if presented with a complete diagram of the state of
his liver and other internal organs, and yet has a
chance of recovery if the awful condition of his
“ innards” is not fully revealed to him. And very few
Victorian financial institutions have seen a correct
colored diagram of their own liver since 1890.

A year or two ago a British depositor in a
certain busted Australian bank wrote out to one of the
liquidators, asking for the history of a certain financier’s
companies. The liquidator clipped from a London
journal a column of particulars re Jabez Balfour and his
companies, wrote on a piece of paper—“ Here you have
the history of the companies,” pinned the paper to
the clipping, and posted to the anxious enquirer. One of
these days, perhaps, the liquidator will receive from
England an account of Balfour’s trial, with sarcastic
comments attached.

It’s quite the rule when a man assigns his estate
and pays, say, 3s. in the £, for his “ friends” or his wife to
come forward and buy the estate back from the assignee.
It’s only in Australia, apparently, that so many friends
who would not save a man from bankruptcy rush forward
enthusiastically to help him after he has gone bung. They
never kick a man when he’s down. Perhaps their busi-
ness experience teaches them that the man who pays 3s.
in the £ eventually dies worth a pile.

The famous sulphides dump at Block 10 is quite
a useful institution. On Ist Oct., ’94, it was esti-
mated to contain 39,734 tons of ore valued at £19,668 10s.
During the ensuing half-year the operations of the mine
threatened to result in a loss, hut the dump was equal tp
the occasion. Although it had meanwhile been reduced
by 1540 tons it nevertheless (by reason of cheaper pro-
cesses ’) obligingly increased in value to £28,645105. This
magnanimous conduct of the dump enabled the co.
to announce in the last half-yearly report a “balance
carried down, being net profit earned during the half-
year ” of £7462 7s. lid.
The Central Cos., in purchasing the Extended
property for £ISOO, got good value in machinery. The
mine will not be used other than as a means of ventila-
tion by connection with the lower Central workings.
Junction Cos. winds up its last half-year (to
March 31) with a working account credit balance of
£422 7s. 4d. Metropolitan management expenses (£464
8s 3d )’transform this, in the profit and loss account,
into a debit of £42 os. lid. Comparison is favorable with
the previous half-year, which showed a loss of £1921
10s. 9d.—of which £9Bl 10s. accrued on the accounts of
the period before that.
The Junction suspended smelting at Port
Adelaide in February, and the new concentrating plant
is now at work at the mine. Results to date are hopeful.
The plant has a capacity of 150 tons a day, and will he

Block 10 had its most successful concentration
last week. The mill put through 308 tons, and recovered
731 per cent, of the lead, and nearly 52 per cent, of the

the ore than to any improvement made in the mill. The
ore dealt with, by the way, is very like the Junction sul-
phides which are, on the whole, as easy to treat as any-
thing on the field ; so that, after all, even the patched-up
plant lately put on Junction may do.

nery on it, and employs over 3500 men. Charters Towers
will lead Australian goldfields for many years to come.

The “ Triumph ” puddler and concentrator,

men. It is claimed that this machine puts quantity
through more cheaply than any machine on the market;
also that the parts are simple, and not liable to get out

In the last batch of W.A. prospectuses from
London one has the charm of novelty—viz., the Murchison
Gold Syndicate. Its grtsat catch-lines are: “A mine
established on a right footing,” “A dividend mine
capable of producing £36,000 a year with a 10-head stamp-
mill.” O, blessed mill! who makest thee?

The prospectus of the Cardiff Castle, an alleged
gold-show between Coolgardie and Dundas, rec
floated in London, is a voluminous and richly-emhellfghed
document. Here is a little extract; ‘‘The directors
selected Oapt. Matthews to report. The fee was a large
one—£3so—and the Oapt. stipulated that the amount
should be paid whatever the report should be.” Amidst
an array' of other reports there appears from the Oapt.
one little cable, “Confirm reports as regards number and
position of lodes. Good gold at bottom of main shaft.
A big; mining man who was there lately apparently much
differs from the Captain’s opinion.

A competent, but unbusinesslike, miner was
recently appointed at a handsome salary to take charge
of an English alleged mine in Westralia. Examining the
property he satisfied himself beyond a doubt it was a
duffer, and, without formally resigning or saying a word,
shouldered his swag and walked off. His only explana-
Hon (sufficient in every other business but mining) was
“The and thing is no good.” However, the mine
remained unjumped in his absence—another proof of its
value. Yet shares are, or have been, at a premium in
London.

The Bulletin regrets to hear that even the Star
of the East, the great mine of the Murchison, which pro-
mised so well and is so ably handb and bv Oapt. Dick, once
of the Barrier, is of very low-grade character below the

Democrat, Glen Wills, Yic., 90 tons for 5280 z.,

At the Londonderry shareholders’ meeting, after
Gorrie had spoken of five tons of gold in eight weeks, and
one Pearce, Aarons, and others had described the mine
as truly great, Col. North deemed it advisable to state
that those who bore testimony at the love-feast had re-
ceived no inducement bey'ond “ snda and whisky.” But
nobody asked, “How much whisky, Colonel?” They’re
a dull lot in London.

Bayley’s has had another mild flutter—in fact,
they even went to 13s. one day at Coolgardie. Next we
shall hear of Coolgardieites buying and putting them
away for a year. Some wonderful strike is saidjto have
been made at 380 ft., and it is also announced that the
North-eastern shaft has struck it rich. But no corres
pondent considered it worth while to wire the last crush-
ing viz., 330 tons for 290nz.-under an ounce—which,
under ordinary conditions, can surely not pay at Cool-
gardie. It is equally well to remember that that mar-
vellous market-organiser, Sylvester Browne, is now in
London. “ Beware of the Bull.” This purely bucolic
notice ought to be posted in some ore-paddcoks.
The new find at Bayley’s this week was thrown
open to pressmen and others. One par. : “ The gold is
very heavy, coarse but free, and was right through the
stone.” “Coarse but free” is good, and evidences sn
enviable technical knowledge. Another par.; “The
shoot of gold is five inches wide, and the find is con-
sidered most important as proving permanency.” A five-
inch shoot and permanency is also good. Fiom these in-
dications The Bulletin gleans that whisky is still more
plentiful than water in Coolgardie mining-reporter circles.

Cue wire : “ A sum of .£50,000 has been set
apart for new machinery for the Big Day Dawn mine,
and the work of developing generally. In a few weeks’
time Day Dawn will he very busy.” If a 20-head battery
working over a year won’t set aside any money for divs.
or machinery it is a poor look-out for the Day Dawn with
its ponderous capital. # ,
It is about time the Coolgardie correspondents
gave the Wealth of Expectations another turn.
8 * * * *
A correspondent; If the W.A. blue-bottles
would come outside of Coolgardie and shut up some of the
“sly-grog shanties,” many honest miners would retain
their best quartz-specimens, whilst the specimen-nipper
and dollier would have to travel.

The litigation in connection with the Prince of
Wales and Bonshaw Cos. (Ballarat) seems interminable.
There have already been four actions against the co. for
alleged illegal forfeiture of shares, several appeals to Vic.
FulfCourt—all dismissed—and there is now an appeal
pending to the Privy Council. In all these actions, the
co. has been treated as a registered co., but now some of
the litigants are starting new actions, in which they are
treating the co. as unregistered. Meanwhile, the co. is
afraid to declare any divs.

Because the jury had found that Dooley,
the Oollingwood murderer, killed his wife and
mother-in-law, also the lodger (The Bulletin has
a soft spot in its heart for the man who kills the
lodger) while sane, the assassin’s body was “buried
like a dog.” The “ funeral ” took place at night;
but why Dooley wasn’t planted at the intersection
of “four cross roads with a stake in his inside”
has not been explained. The jury’s verdict was,
of course, an insult to human intelligence. If
Dooley had simply suicided without killing any-
one else, the twelve bumpkins would, as usual,
have returned a verdict of “unsound mind ; ” but
as he committed a sensational series of offences
they went out of their way to say he was sane.
The man’s brain was actually diseased, but pro-
bably there were a number of worse idiots on the
]ory ‘A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback— the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

If so, safe remedies are within your reach at a
nominal cost. CLEMENTS TONIC and FLET-
CHER’S PILLS have never yet failed to cure the
worst cases. General debility, nervousness, weak-
ness, and general complaints of the digestive and
nervous systems are promptly cured by these re-
liable remedies. They are prepared by scientific
processes, and are not merely mechanical mixtures
made only to “gull the public.’’ The renown
CLEMENTS TONIC and FLETCHER’S PILLS
have won in Australasia is proof of the fact that
they stand pre-eminent for their special classes of
diseases. No remedies ever sold gave such en-
tire satisfaction to their patrons, and evidence is
forthcoming from every city, town, and village
to prove their virtues. No doubt can now exist as
to their value, but purchasers must be careful to
get the genuine articles, as many unscrupulous
traders will attempt to palm off a substitute, if
possible, for the sake of extra profit.
HOW TO ASSIST NATURE WITHOUT
hazardous force. A gentleman, who is now above
eighty years of age, writes:—“l have fora long
time used ‘ ENO’S FRUIT SALT ;’ I have found
it an effective yet general aperient, very beneficial
to persons of sedentary habits, especially such as
exercise not the limbs but the brain, and fre-
quently require to assist nature without hazardous
force. It acts according to the quantity taken—
either as a relieving medicine, or as a cooling and
refreshing drink ; and I am convinced that it does
not weaken when it stimulates.” Caution.—
Examine each bottle and see the capsule is marked
“ ENO’S FRUIT SALT.” Without it you have
only a worthless imitation.

Ex-police-magistrate T. A. Browne (“Rolf

where he will be connected with the Argus and
Australasian. He hopes also to familiarise him-
self with the practical work of staging dramas,
with a view to cutting up some of his own novels
for such presentation.
The Argus mentions Tallerman’s death,
in London, about six weeks ago. Having great
business interests in Melbourne, he sensibly made
himself a kind of Agent-General, and, though
riches took wings, as they will do with men of
such aspirations, he always ranked with West-
garth, as a not altogether selfish absentee.
When Acting-Governor Madden courted

A photo, of Sir Buxton, S.A. Governor-
designate, reached Adelaide last week. The face
is typical of the evangelical brewer, and the smug,
contented smile proclaims the subject’s satisfac-
tion at the brewery dividends sent by the Lord

and, except for the beard, Buxton is almost a
replica of pastor Jefferis. Why does the evan-
gelical saint always shave and la Brigham Young?
Cabled demise : Yesey Fitzgerald. Over 40
years ago he was regarded, by the Colonial Office,
as the nicely-squared-off, appropriate official to

sent him to collaborate with Gov. Hotham. He
was then called Foster, but dropped it after failing
so dismally. He showed up in Melb. again, an
insignificant little man.
The determination of N.S.W. Lieut.-
Governor Darley to hold the Queen’s Birthday
levee on May 27, Parkes’ birthday, recalls John
Haynes’ pleasantry of several years ago, to the
effect that Parkes would have been born on May
24 only that he wished the national celebrations of
his anniversary not to clash with those of Queen
Victoria. And now they will clash.
Alex. Stewart, long noted as the oldest
living resident of Illawarra (N.S.W.) district,
died last week, aged 85. He was born in Ireland
in 1809, and arrived at Wollongong on the 24th
Feb., 1828, when there were not more than 50
males, 10 married women, and 16 children in the
whole of the coastal district from Belli to Jam-
beroo. He served for some years in the N.S.W.
police force, and was a shining light of teetotalism.
Dear Bulletin, —I found yet another
legal Stephen while recently exploring the old v
Melb. cemetery, in which Batman is buried. The
inscription runs thus : “In memory of Henry
George Alfred Stephen, third son of Mr. Justice
Stephen, New Zealand, who closed a life of
amiability and promise Jan. 10, A.D., 1851, at
the early age of 21 years.” The shadow of Bat-
man’s obelisk falls across this tomb. Batman was
born in Parramatta, N.S.W., in the year 1800.—
Yours, &c., C.R.W.
In a Melb. court a Chow washerman, the
other day, sued the son of a great novelist for
arrears of shirt-cleansing. As several months had
elapsed between the time the debt was contracted
and the date of taking out the summons, the Bench
inquired the reason. John explained that his for-
bearance was due to the “ lespeck ” he had for the
creditor’s great father. An original tribute to
genius. Which recalls, by the way, that in Sydney
a memorial to old Jack Robertson is now being
promoted by Mr. Quong Mao Tart, of China.
Poor old Jimmy Munro carries a farewell
letter from Lord Hopetoun next to his ancient
Caledonian heart. One of Hopetoun’s last acts of
state was the posting of a complimentary yarn to
each of the five Premiers who had flourished
during his term of office. Jimmy was one of the
illustrious quintette. It seems ages ago since
Victoria’s destiny was ruled by that abnormal
banker, yet he really did rule up to the time
when the health of his financial concerns sug-
gested a hasty trip to London. He was one of
the meteors that flashed across Gov. Hopetoun’s
regime. Therefore, he got a vice-regal document,
thanking him for having been such a credit to the
country, and loyal supporter of the Queen, and so
nice a man to talk to in the Executive Council
chamber, Jimmy is aggressively proud of this
talisman. He thrusts it under the noses of chance
acquaintances, requesting them to read that. A
letter of praise and thanks from His Excellency is
a complete answer to the cry of the calumniator,
in J. Munro’s opinion. If he were to suddenly
meet the irate depositor who once plugged him in
Collins-st., the ex-Premier would whip his certi-
ficate of virtue from his breast-pocket, and scream
“ Look at that !”
The next Academy work of young Ber-
tram Mackennal, the Australian sculptor, will,
The Bulletin hears from London, enhance the
artist’s already high reputation. The subject,
from the Book of Proverbs, is entitled “The
Frivolous Woman,” and represents the woman
seated with her feet resting upon a figure of Love,
gazing disdainfully at supposed passers-by.
Mackennal had to be very wary in his treatment
of the subject after his experience of the goody-
good i ness of the Academy people in connection
with his Circe last year.
Cabled that W. A. Horn, ex-Gov. Kin-
tore’s friend, is to be knighted for his “services to
Australian exploration.” Bosh ! The ex-S.A.
squatter and stockbroker guided Kintore’s Broken
Hill specs., by which the latter cleared about
.£25,000, and Kintore is now to be on the London
directorate of Wilson’s big Westralian co., in
which Horn holds a large interest. The coming
knighthood is not a reward for public services.
Horn is a wealthy man, and a Tory who was
known to a limited circle in S. A.; and he never did
anything which will be remembered.
Premier Turner is ubiquitous. Although
up late every night over tariff reform and retrench-
ment and referendum problems, he still finds time
to preside at meetings of tin-pot suburban football
clubs, &o. One recent evening was devoted to
distributing the season’s prizes of an obscure
cricket-club. The Premier apparently views such
affairs with much gravity, and when “ distri-
buting ” a prize to Johnnie Jones, as the season’s
champion alley-player, he looks as if it were the
most important moment in the history of the
cosmos.
Here is the first bit of wattle-blossom
“ waving ” over the bushman’s grave :—
It is from the earliest Tasmanian magazine, and
its author, as he deserved, was hanged.
As so few of the old Governors of N.S. W.
have left direct descendants, it is specially interest-
ing to note that on 24th April, at St. Paul’s, Bur-
wood, Sydney, G. B. D. King, of Goonoo Goonoo,
Tamworth (N.S.W.), was married to Miss Amelie
Lloyd, daughter of Mr. C. W. Lloyd, ofLlanarth,
Burwood. The bridegroom is fifth in descent
from Governor King, who ruled in “Botany Bay”
in 1800. At the wedding were present representa-
tives of many old Australian families : The Kings,
Coxs, Campbells, MacArthurs, &c.—not the least
conspicuous group being that comprising Mr. P. G.
King, M.L.O., and Mrs. King, surrounded by
their sons, grandsons and a great grand-daughter.
George Ranken, who died the other day
at Young, N.S.VV., aged 68, was a pioneer of
something more than local celebrity. He accom-
panied the explorer Landsborough through Cen-
tral Queensland in the early fifties, and took up
station property there, afterwards holding various
responsible positions under Government. On
coming to N.S.W., he was appointed a member of
two Commissions to report on the land laws, on
which subject he was a high authority. He
had considerable literary talent, and was a valued
contributor to this journal in its early days. A
volume of his “Bush Essays” was published in
Edinburgh in 72, and his novel “ Windabyne ” is
shortly to be issued in London. He also com-
piled a useful geography of Australia. George
Ranken was emphatically a “ white man ”—large-
hearted, generous, and enthusiastic —and grey
hairs never altered the beat of the heart always
young in his bosom.
THE BARMAPS[?] (FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I’M a simple little

I’m as chipper as

My purse is never
empty, and my jewels
can command
A fair amount of ooftish
from each “ uncle ”in

My complexion’s due to

And I wear the very

swellest hats in town.
You ask me how I do
it? How I go the

Well, I only laugh and
sing again the bar-

Are you coming

Are you coming

That’s the tune to mash
the johnnies, and it
really knocks ’em
quite !
Are you coming

Are you coming

That’s the carol of the
simple little barmaid
I’m a simple little
barmaid, but I really
know the ropes ;
I know just how to
kindle and extinguish
little hopes ;
I know exactly what’s
required to work a
Sunday drive
As far as Mordialloc,
with a champagne
tea at five;
I know precisely what
to do to get a Prin-
cess box,
With an oyster supper
after, and the best of
German hocks;
I can work a trip to
“Tassie,”too, though
some folks say that’s
wrong;
But I only laugh and
sing again the bar-
maid’s little song—
Are you coming
in to-night ?
Are you coming in to-night?
There’s a world of meaning in it, if you only
read it right!
Are you coming in to-night ?
Are you coming in to-night?
That’s the carol of the simple little barmaid !
I go in strong for racing, yet a bet I never lose;
I smile upon a bookie, and the tip he can’t
refuse;
Then twenty pounds to nothing is the entry
that he makes,
And I really can’t fall in, you know, because
I risk no stakes.
Melb.
And when I fade, and boys don’t hover rom.d
as once they did,
I’ll wed some rich, young squatter who makes
for my heart a bid,
And later figure in Toorak as Lady Billabong ;
Yes, oft the pathway to Toorak is the bar-
maid’s little song—
Are you coming in to-night?
Are you coming in to-night ?
I’ll use the same old song to make some silly
squatter bite!
Are you coming in to-night ?
Are you coming in to-night?
That’s the carol of the simple little barmaid !
STEBLE GREY.
Beneath this sod the bush man lies,
Mingled with mother earth ;
While onward rolls in buoyant course
The world in wanton mirth.
Mimosas green bedeck the spot,
Their branches mournful wave.
Murmuring a dirge, in th’ evening wind.
Over the bushman’s grave.

Gov. Buxton, the new beer-viceroy of S.A.,

unregenerate to know that his salary will be paid
in part out of the license-fees from the sinful tote.
7J Harper, the rampant Vic. Freetrade M. L. A.,
o nnplains bitterly of the proposal to reduce by one-
half the 20 per cent, duty on linseed oil, which,
he says, in a letter to the press, “ is by no means
excessive”—and solemnly urges the retention of
the old impost. The M.P., it seems, was just
ab >ut starting a linseed-oil mill, and as a con-
sistent Freetrader he wants Protection for his own
littleindustry. It is quite right he should be pro-
tected, but the spectacle of the Freetrade M.P.
stating that a 20 per cent, duty on his own mill
“is by no means excessive” is grotesque.
The new duties put on without notice by
Freetrade Premier Reid have already, according
to the commercial editor of the Sydney Tele-
graph, raised the price of sago and tapioca 90 per
cent.; rock salt, 60 per cent.; raw coffee, 25 per
cent.; and linseed oil, 20 to 25 per cent. As N.S.
Wales isn’t, so far as at present known, a country
where coffee or sago or tapioca can be profitably
grown, these duties won’t create any industry or
supply any employment—they merely raise prices.
The Freetrader doesn’t mind raising prices—all he
is afraid of is lest he may be betrayed into helping
some Australian industry ; so the “Dibbs duties,”
which furnished revenue and supplied work at
the same time, come off, and the Reid
duties, which furnish revenue, but are
guaranteed not to supply any work, go
on in their stead.
Premier Turner announce?,
that he sees his way to reduce the
Victorian expenditure by another
.£465,000 per annum. This will
make a saving of £3,123,000 per
annum as compared with 1890,
the year of Duncan Gillies’ won-
derful boom budget. Every Vic.
Treasurer since Gillies' has done
his country good service by
cutting another huge hunk off
the expenditure, and even
Shiels and Munro, judged bj
results, were incomparably
better public financiers than
Dibbs, Parkes, Reid, See,
M'Millan, or Bruce Smith.
If N.S. Wales could borrow
William Shiels to run the
Treasury—and Shiels isn’t
doing much just now, and
seems as if he could spare,
himself very well —it ought
to be a profitable spec. Or
it might do a lot worse than

lb is publicly rumored that several mem-
bers of both Vic. Houses have, by compounding
with their cronlVors, forfeited their seats. Who
will “bell the cat?” Heavy penalties are men-
tioned in the (Constitution Act, in which the
successful presenter would share—assuming that
there is any salvage. A curious difficulty occurs
in the case of (malpositions. A member who goes
insolvent loses Kis seat, but on being whitewashed
may again contest it. But no such provision is
made in the case of a “compounder.” So that
the inference is that he is not eligible for election
until he has paid 20s. in the £-probably with
interest added.
Queenslanders cannot be too often remind-
ed, in face of the present Ministerial jubilations
over increased revenue, that <£ 1,400,000 has been
added, or is about to bo added, to the debt of the
province by conversion of revenue-deficits into
funded debt.
It is asserted that Premier Kingston stood
alone against his five colleagues in opposing rail-
way-chairman Smith’s re-appointment. He re-
mained obstinate, and, after a delay of over six
weeks, Pendleton was appointed as a compromise.
Smith may possibly be offered the Yic. commis-
sionership, which will be open in Oct.
Yic. income-tax is responsible for some
queer attempts at evasion. A Brunswick pro-
perty-owner, who had six houses unoccupied for
18 months, becoming frightened at the prospect
of further taxation, solved the difficulty by pulling
the tenements to pieces and selling the timber,
brick, &o. But later on ho found that the pro-
ceeds were regarded as income and came within
the operations of the Act.
Major-General Hutton will receive, as per
agreement, .£320 from N.S.W. Treasury to pay
his travelling expenses back to England early next
year. The expenses are described as including
his own, his wife’s, and a servant’s. This sum,
on a rough estimate, approaches the Duncan
Gillies scale, and while Governments exhibit such
liberality their frenzied cries for departmental
retrenchment are mere melodrama.
Dear Bulletin, —The subsidising of the
Sydney unemployed is a new form of Protection.
They are given tucker, a free railway-pass to the
goldfields of the province, and a miner’s right.
Now, the country man, equally poor, who has no
bureau to go to or means to reach the Sydney one,
and who mines without a right, if found out, is
heavily fined. Where is the justice in the dis-
tinction ?— A. F. Spring. Young, May 12, ’95.
Vic. Govt, replies to Judge Moles worth re
docking half his salary while on three weeks’ sick
leave, that orders have been issued to apply the
same rule to all, from the lowest to the highest.
The Judge had taken it that he was suspected of
“malingering.” But the rule is a good one. The
Bulletin learns that Solicitor-General Outhbert
is now sick and about to take a health-trip co
S.A. It will be interesting to learn that he
has applied the same undiscriminating rule to
himself (“the highest ”).
H. : “I must join issue with The Bul-
letin about the Judges. I contend they ought
all to be under the Government, which is respon-
sible to the people. Robespierre’s principle, in
this matter, is the safest; that, in practice, we
ought never to assume anybody to be more
virtuous than the bulk of the people, and if these
be otherwise, why, the community falls to pieces.
On the other assumption, that the people are bad
and the few good have to be fenced in with
privileges, you open the door for the worst abuses
that characterise the English nation. All the
magistracy must thus be roped in, as well as the
Judges, who are only higher magistrates. The
American Judges are just (about as good as the
English.”

(Authentic.)
Instead of a Supreme Court Judge being
entitled to a full pension for life (of, in N.S. W.,
£lBOO a year) if permanently disabled by illness
ten minutes after he gets his appointment, it
would be advisable to grant a pension of (say)
one-fourth of the regulation allowance to the dig-
nitary who collapses any time within the first five
years of his service ; of one half to the one who
falls in harness at any time between his fifth and
tenth year ; and of two-thirds to the man who
outlasts his tenth year but does not complete his
fifteen years’ term, while only the man who does
his full term will be entitled to the whole amount.
Then the eminent barrister with a diseased lung
or deranged liver, who knows that he will pro-
bably break down after a very few years’ service,
would have less inducement than at present to
accept judicial office, and would cost less if he did
accept it, and the country would get better value
for its money all round.

THE FIRST BICYCLE ON THE PLAINS.
OLD LIGNUM: “ Wot's that, Joe?”

ridin' on the wheels. Good iron! ”
O. L. : “ Wot’s the bush a-comin’ to?”
A sporting member of N.S.W. Assembly :
“Poor old Parkes’ speech was a pitiable affair,
but Premier Reid’s reply put me on pins and
needles. He had all the cards in his hands
and up his sleeve, and was very brave; he kept
on battering at the old chap, who sat there shiver-
ing with cold—in fact, looking more dead than
alive. I don’t say that old man Parkes didn t
deserve most of what he got, and he did catch it,
with a vengeance ; but if I’d been Varney Parkes
I couldn’t have helped jumping over the back
bench and plugging Georgey-Porgey m the eye
when he called my old father * a tom-cat.
The proposed settlement of the railway-
war between New South Wales, Victoria and
S. A. for the Riverina traffic has fallen through,
and the old struggle will still go on. It will pro-
bably keep going on till a Federal Parliament
wipes out the venerable quarrel, along with a lot
of others. The compromise failed, as usual,
because each province “wanted the earth,” and
the one which thought it was going to get a little
less of it than the others backed out. Everything
went well until it cn-me to the rush for the odd
half-penny, and then all semblance of unity
vanished.
Cabled that a Bill is to be introduced into
the Lords authorising the appointment of
“colonial” Judges to the Privy Council. This
remarkable eagerness to rush the matter through
is another reason why the Australian Parliaments
should go slow in the matter. The last time the
British Government was in a hurry about a mere
“ colonial” matter was when the rascally Naval
Tribute scheme was scurried through. And every
other time when it has bustled itself about the
affairs of Greater Britain, it has been over some-
thing concerning which “ the colonies ” were more
or less sold, or were intended to be.
This extract from an English judgment on
an employers’-liability case shows that even in
that land of “ freedom ” the glorious principle of
“ freedom of contract ” is gradually growing
“cronk.” Soon, no one but the ARGUS will
maintain the “gag” :
It can’t be said, where a man is lawfully engaged in
work and is in danger of dismissal if he leaves his work,
that he wilfully incurs any risk which he may encounter
in the course of such work. If the plaintiff could have
o-one away from the dangerous place without incurring
the lisk of losing his means of livelihood, the case might
have been different, but he was obliged to be there: his
poverty, not Ids will, consented to incur the danger.
Vide Eagleson on employers’ liability, p. 181.
The last sentence is worth remembering in “free-
dom of contract ” discussions.
There are some extraordinarily small
constituencies in Westralia, resembling the
“rotten boroughs” before the Reform Bill
of ’32. In the W.A. Legislative Assembly F.
Connor represents East Kimberley (26 electors !).
Murchison boasts 37 electors, whilst R. F. Sholl,
member for Gascoyne, a huge area of country,
only represents 24 electors. Thirty-seven pastor-
alists constitute De Grey electorate, whilst
haughty Attorney-General Burt (member for
Ashburton) is sent to Parliament by 52 people.
Alick Forrest (the Premier’s brother) represents
98 in West Kimberley, and Horace W. Sholl is
sent to the House by 91 for Roebourne. Even
the Premier, who has got a family seat in Bun-
bury, is only the mouthpiece for 262 persons.
The Victorian income-tax is now estimated
to yield only about £155,000 or £160,000 a year,
and £50,000 of the amount is alleged to be contri-
buted by civil servants. This circumstance has
roused a number of shallow persons to a frenzied
belief that one-third of the aggregate income of
the country is that which the State pays to a set
of bloated bureaucrats. The much more reason-
able explanation is that the civil servant must
give his official income correctly, because his state-
meats are checked by the Estimates in other
words, that he is a compulsory G. Washington ;
and that the rest of the community has lied dis-
gracefully and horribly. There was such a dire
necessity for money that no time could be spent in
verifying assertions, no matter how glaring ; the
schedules were rushed through at the rate of 1000
per day, and no questions asked.
The members of the S.A. Parliamentary
Labor-party look nervously forward to the general
elections next April. Yet a little while ago they
talked about capturing all the seats and dis-
lodging Kingston, Solierk, Jenkins, George xiaw-
ker, and other members who, though they invari-
ably vote on the Liberal side, are not Trades Hall
nominees.
Premier Reid, in
the first branch of his
Financial Statement,
asserted that N.S.
Wales was Freetrade
till 1865. When on his
feet half-an-hour, he
likened himself to
Stuart Alexander Don-
aldson, “who followed
a Govt, which, without
any wrenching of
words, may be described
as Protectionist.” It is
in points of this kind
that a man who pro-
fesses to know a great
deal, and who speaks
from mere skeleton-
notes, falls below the
man who writes out
his speech in extenso,
or else really knows'hia
subject by heart, Tht
fact is that, from thd
year 1800, when duties
were levied to aid a
fund for building the
first Sydney gaol, N.S.
Wales has never been,
except in a measure,
Freetrade. Further,
should it have escaped
Mr. Reid’s recollection
that, in 1859, Parkee
carried, in the Assembly
of the day, a motion
abolishing the duty on
tea and sugar ?
Moule, M. P.,
“cussing’’ and dis-
cussing Socialism for
the edification of Melb.
“Reform” Club, gave
his case away by ad-
mitting that the neglect
of some individuals
made the protection of
the common health the
duty of the State.
Similarly, the neglect,
selfishness, greed, and
trickery of “ some indi-
viduals ” make it the
duty of the State to
secure a juster distribu-
tion of wealth for the
good of the community.
“ What wonder that such laws should
become hateful, and that standing here on the
spot where I first drew breath—in sight of a
levelled home, with memories of privations and
tortures crowding on my mind, I should swear to
devote the remainder of my life to the destruction
of what has blasted my early years, pursued me
with its vengeance through manhood, and leaves
my family in exile to-day far from that Ireland
which is itself wronged, robbed, and humiliated
through the agency of the same accursed system !
It is no little consolation to know, however, that
I may yet have the satisfaction of trampling on
the ruins of Irish landlordism.'’ — Michael Davitt,
at a meeting in County Mayo, Feb. 1880.
If “revenue duties” were imposed (says
the Argus) Civil Service retrenchment would be
superfluous. The germ of a great idea :
The object of this par. is to state, in answer
to inquiries, that Mademoiselle Emilie Estevenet
is the same costumiere who was at Messrs. Alston
and Brown’s establishment a few years ago. When
that firm went out of business, Mdlle. Emilie
returned to Paris, and subsequently to London;
and, in both centres of fashion, gained a leading
reputation for distinctiveness and originality, in
addition to the other attributes of a court dress-
maker. Among other royalties, she designed
gowns for H.I.H. the German Empress. Mdlle.
Emilie has now engaged her services to Messrs.
Hicks, Atkinson and Sons, of Collins-st., Melb.
If our goods were all imported, if we made none
of our own,
And if duties were for revenue and that alone
collected,
There would be no vile retrenchment and no
cutting to the bone—
We might all have higher wages than we’ve
hitherto expected.
Calculate the many millions that are squandered
on the hands
Making hats and boots and other things too
numerous to mention,
Which, if brought from German factories or from
other foreign lands,
Would return a mighty revenue and abolish all
dissension.
That Protection’s howling madness is as plain as
A.8.C.,
Try the freer-trader’s principle, which full of
homely nous is,
Then might all be civil-servants and as happy as
can be
On the money gathered daily in the busy
Custom Houses.

“Is it not a fact that habitual arsenic-
, eaters can take what are to others poisonous doses
daily without apparent ill results; until, sud-
denly, at some other weak turn of health, and
especially if they cease the daily dose, they sud-
denly exhibit severe symptoms of arsenical poison-
ing? ” In ’75, at the 48th annual meeting of the
German Society of Naturalists and Physicians,
Dr. Knapp, practising in Styria, introduced two
male arsenic-eaters to the Assembly. One of
these men consumed, in the presence of the
savants, more than 6grs. white arsenic—enough to
poison three ordinary men—without suffering the
slightest inconvenience. Arsenic-eating is a com-
mon practice among the ox-herds and shepherds
of Styria, where it is known by the name of
fiedri. Hedrists, once they commence the habit,
cannot leave it off. If an arsenic-eater discon-
tinues his indulgence, the last dose kills him —the
sudden cessation of the habit being the cause of
death. Thus a Continental toxicologist: “ The
gradual cessation produces such a heart-growing
that it may probably be said that no genuine
arsenic-eater ceased to eat arsenic while life
lasted.” So early as 1822, Dr. Heisoh first discussed
the subject of arsenic-eating, and, in 1851, Tschudi
brought the matter prominently before medical
science. Since that time scientific research has
amply proved Hedri to be no fiction. The Styrians
commence with minute doses, usually taken once
a week ; then twice a week, then once a day ; the
doses being steadily increased in strength. The
habit is hereditary, so that the present race is
almost arsenic-proof. Want of the poison is the
thing that kills, yet, when death ensues, the corpse
has all the symptoms of arsenical poisoning.
« • •
Poisoned rabbits, it is averred, are being
sent to Sydney for sale. It has been represented
that regular consignments of arsenic and strych-
nine-saturated rabbits are received from the runs
and sold for human food. However, in view of
the marvellous toxicological discoveries lately
made by N.S. W. Supreme Court the remedy is
obvious. If after eating rabbit and onions you
find yourself suffering from arsenical poisoning,
all you need do is to load yourself up with
strychnined rabbit. If, on the other hand, a meal
of rabbit produces tetanic convulsions, the obvious
remedy is lOgrs. arsenic every half-hour. Shake
the bottle well.

Melb. Pressman : “ I am a Protestant my-
self, but must confess that the courtesy and cor-
diality (whisky is a cordial) of the Catholic priests,
as compared with the high and haughty—even
insolent —demeanour of the Anglican pilots, are
tending to weaken my faith. As a scribe, I called
on Bishop Goe recently for an advance copy of his
sermon in MS. After being kept waiting on the
Episcopalian doorstep for some time, the flunkey
told me that ‘his lordship’ would allow me to
copy the deliverance if I called at 9 a.m,
on Sunday. I went, after walking three
miles, and was told to sit down in the pala-
tial hall and copy the precious document.
A few Sundays after I had occasion to report
Archbishop Carr, and the difference in treatment
astounded me. When I enquired for the MS. I
was welcomed by the prelate in person, who con-
siderately refreshed me, and said he would ask a
Holy Father to make a copy and hand it to me
after service. Going at the appointed time I
found the MS. copied in a clear, schoolboy hand
—and more, I was asked in by the Archbishop
and supped merrily with him and his priestly
following, not a word being said about religion or
the object of my mission. This, mark you, is a
typical occurrence. The priest is a man of the
world, and doesn’t pretend to be a bit better than
he is. It is not the fault of Australian heretic
pressmen if the R.C. faith isn’t boomed whenever
occasion presents itself.”

Illustrative of the system of allowing Judges’
relatives to practise before “ the old man ” :
During a more or less recent circuit. Judge X. pre-
sided over a case in which his young and recently-
“ called ” relative, Mr. X., held a brief for defen-
dant. Mr. X. has not yet gained that experience
which will probably come to him hereafter. And
so, when plaintiff’s counsel asked a question
which was clearly inadmissible, no one was very
greatly surprised that Mr. X. should allow it to
pass. The Judge, however, shifted uneasily and
looked hard at his kinsman—who, in happy un-
consciousness, continued to idly pull a quill_ to
pieces, and failed to notice his Honor’s meaning
glances. So, in sheer desperation, the Judge
took the matter into his own hands.
“Surely, Mr. ,” he said, with affected sur-
prise—“surely you do not think of asking that
question!” “Certainly,” was the reply ; “it is
not objected to by the other side.” “Well, you
needn’t be in such a hurry. You might give Mr.
X. a chance to open his mouth.” Even a man
engrossed in pulling a quill to pieces could not fail
to take this hint, and Mr. X. at last rose to his
feet and did object.

Can you trace my sister, Mrs. A. Brown, formerly Mrs.
D. Bugging, maiden name Annie Brummage. Her hus-
band's name is Dick Brown, who had to change his name
because his brother’s wife’s name was Annie. You will
oblige her (Mrs. A. Brown’s) brother—Qboror Bruqglb-
smith.
It looks as though brother George had also to
change his name. In fact, it looks like a thousand
things.

At a fire in Melbourne, a few
days ago, two adjoining shops were
burnt down. The one Was a patent-
corset maker’s, and the other was
stocked with Catholic and Pagan
images. The Devil might have looked
after his own—though whether the
corsets or the images, it is not for
The Bulletin to say.

Two aboriginal girls, aged 15
and 13, were baptised at Toowoomba
(Q.), the other day, in the course of a
service which lasted six hours, and
was graced by the presence of three
Ms.L. A. (organising for the election
in prospect). The girls were specially
imported from Mackay, 400 miles
North. Q. philosophers have already
remarked how diligently the guileless
missionaries labor for the salvation of
young gins.

Dear Bulletin, —A Yic. sign of
the times. The wretches who com-
pulsorily pass the night in Melb.
Public Gardens are now to be seen
any morning saving their lives by
gathering and eating the mushrooms
which grow there. One poor devil
told me he had lived entirely on
mushrooms and water for four days.

Judge Williams (Yic.) on Shiels’
Di vorce Act : “I think it one of the
most humane and beneficial pieces of
legislation that has been passed by
our Parliament.” Chief Justice
Madden (a Roman Catholic, by the
way) heartily abuses the measure
whenever opportunity offers.

The Rev. Haweis admits that

From “In Town” —Maud Hobson (of the
Ambiguity Theatre) discussing another lady (f
the company—“ Yes, she’s very French; h« r
father and mother are going to get married soon,
and she’ll keep house for them.” The calm auda
city with which Miss H. passes remarks of tint
sort seems to make them almost proper.
In Melb. Divorce Court the other day Judge
Williams granted a nisi against a wife who refused
to suckle her first-born “for fear of spoiling her
figure,” and subsequently cleared out, leaving
her husband with the baby, which died in her
absence :
There is much difference in the dietary-
scales of some of the Australian prisons. For
instance, Darlinghursb is much preferred, by the
roving criminal, to PeiHridge. In the big yic.
prison there is an unchanging menu of boiled
mutton and beef with vegetables. Pudding is
allowed only once a year—at Xmas, to inspire the
confinees with gentle feelings. At Darlinghurst,
on the other hand, roast dishes, corned beef, and
stews, with suet dumplings and treacle pudding,
make practicable a palatable daily variation. Men
who have done the rounds of all the provincial
gaols declare that Victorian prisoners are th e
worst-fed of the lot. The only redeeming featur^
Maud Hobson in a morning dress,
With tilted chin and haughty mien,
Seems something more than a princess—
“ God save our gorgeous gracious Queen !”
Her subjects sing with heart and voic* l .
But monarch Maud in regal tights
Fans loyal sparks to am’rous flame :
And when she walks the stage o’ nights
Beneath their breath the boys exclaim—
“ O, would that we were Hobson's choice !”
Hush-a-bye, baby, drop oft to sleep,
And if you would moisten your throttle,
’Member that mumma her “outline" must keep
So, pray, be content with the bottle.
Murama’s a vision in satin and silk,
Puppa’s a wretch, ever snarling ;
Tlie four-legged cow gives delectable milk,
So, hush-a-bye, rock-a-bye, darling.
Bless my soul ! baby, lift up your head—
Why this remarkable rigour?
Who would have thought it, the treasure is dead 1
But mumma believes in her Agger.
Baby will merge into ashes and dust ;
Hark ! there’s the bogey-man chuckling—
“ Another one killed for the sake of a bust
Which wasn’t intended for suckling.’’

Bathurst, whose gaol has lately been the
scene of a number of rebellious uprisings, cul-
minating in homicide in O’Connor’s case, and in
attacks on warders in various fashions, with
floggings and ironings as consequences, is regain-
ing some of its ancient prison reputation. The
fiercest of N.S.W. prison revolts occurred there
nearly 70 years ago. In the conflict two men and
five horses were killed, and when the outbreak was
quelled hundreds of floggings were administered
and ton mon wore hnmrod
and ten men were hanged.

The Anonci nnbliohes a fist, of so colled
ine ARGUS puDUSties a list or so-called
mistakes made by Melb. Sunday scholars, answer-
ing Biblical questions. Most of them seem, to a
dispassionate reader, evidences of common-sense,
with not a few smart pieces of sarcasm. There is
a national bias in the juvenile mind towards
Truth and against Terewth which is very hard to
kill utterly.
A now prosperous Sydney soli-
citor, who had a hard row to hoe when
he started practice (his first six months
yielded exactly .£8 10s.), tells the story
of his first client. He defended the man
on a criminal charge at the instance of a
friend who had, out of charity, been
supportingthe accused’s wifeand family
whilst the bread-winner was in gaol
awaiting trial. Our attorney aided in
securing prisoner’s acquittal, “ and you
would have thought,” he says, “that
the whole boiling of ’em—man, wife and
children—would have expired out of
sheer gratitude to me. I certainly never
expected them to recover. As they
hadn’t a red cent, I told the man that I
didn’t want to make any money out of
the thing, butthat I was poor myself
and would like to get back the £9 odd I
had paid out of pocket for counsel, etc.
They swore to repay within six months,
but I never heard a word from them for
quite a year, and had almost determined
to forget about the matter when one
night I saw them in the theatre-stalls,
all well-dressed and enjoying them-
selves hilariously. This aroused my gall
somewhat, and I wrote the ex-prisoner
a letter saying that, as he now seemed
fairly prosperous, he might possibly be
able to pay me my £9. In response,
his wife came to see me. Quoth she :
“Of course, we’ll pay you when we
make some money, bub really I don’t
think you ought to worry about it. I’m
quite sure you did it for an advertise-
ment.”
There is a mighty moral in this. No-
body who does charity publicly gets (or
deserves) credit nowadays for being
actuated by anything more lofty than
Advt. Thie only people really charit-
able at heart are those who do good
works—and studiously keep their names
out of the newspapers.
Dear Bulletin, —Be article on pick-
pockets. I happen to know the boss man, an
Australian-born. He is the dazzler of the profes-
sion, and made his friends’ hair stand on end by
the way he cleaned out a lot of the parsons
assembled at Spencer-street, Melbourne, to wel-
come Talmage. Also, he was the leading genius
in the famous Ballarat Bank robbery, when a
large safe was taken away and left in a marsh,
but he had real bad luck in another city, where a
detective caught him in the act of cleaning out a
provincial. For this he did three years. A little
square-built, nerveful man, with keen, penetrating
eyes, an ideal bank-teller. He has distinctly
raised the tone of the profession, and all Austra-
lians should be proud of him.—E. M. Watts,
Adelaide.

messes coming away in a perambulator, is enough
to give you your dinner. One poor devil of a

Gall from retiring country editor :
Several readers have complained that the Express is
too much alive—matter is written too brightly—and that
they prefer their literature dished up in the style usually
characteristic of the country press. In order to appease
those readers, and to show that the Express can write
pars, of the proper sort, we beg to state that our worthy
citizen, Mr. James Smith, the local cahdriver, is suffering
from a bad attack of influenza. He is in good medical
hands, and his fellow citizens hope ere long to S( e him
well and handling the ribbons in his usual accomplished

An enterprising “beat” is working the
southern suburbs of Melbourne on “a new lay.”
He carries a tattered Bible with him, and deals
with parsons, church elders, and pious females.
He exhibits his fragmentary Bible to sympathetic
souls, and begs for a good one, with gentle
unction and copious quotations of apropos texts.
Be can do with little bread and poor raiment, he
says, with an air of superhuman resignation, but
he pines without the Word. Result, in nine cases
out of ten, a new or second-hand copy of the Real
Secret of England’s greatness, and a shilling or
so for creature comforts. A grand clearing-sale
of new and second-hand Bibles pending.

Three lady bicyclists they were,
New Women, garbed in knickers gay,
Who posed without a tremor there,
Admired by then who passed that way,
Till one came up, a man of phlegm,
Who eyed them o’er, and loudly said ;
“My oath ! there ain’t no flies on them.”
And then they blushed and turned and fled.

Jack O. (Kianclra); The publican calls his hotel
the “Royal” or the “Victoria,” either because he is
loyal, or because he thinks his customers are loyal, or
because he knows that the licensing authorities are loyal
and grovelsome and the name makes them feel better, or
else from force of habit. We don’t know which it is.
Stephen M.: Don’t care to publish the poor, ungramma-
tical wretch’s love-letter. Nobody’s love-letters can bear
inspection for that matter. Ours wouldn’t, anyhow ...

Men don’t wager like that; women may do so E. B.
Queldon : Judge Molesworth’s plea for security of tenure
and for a salary charged on consolidated revenue is per-
fectly justifiable. Such a system is just as necessary

expect doctors to give time and medicine for nothing.
Many of them do it out of charity, but the community
can’t ask it as a right. As to Government paying
for sudden calls in moneyless cases, doubt if it’s
practicable. Who is to define a “sudden call” or a
“ moneyless patient.” Is the doctor to come to all calls?
The Govt, to pay fees in all cases? When Govt, endows
hospitals and benevolent societies it does almost as much
as can be expected Corho: What the world is waiting
for in art, literature and philosophy is the female view of
the male just as the male view has exhaustively been
given of the female. Woman knows exactly what man
thinks of her, and of every pleasure she can afford him.
Man wants badly to know what woman really thinks of
him and the gratification which he imagines he gives her.
When this has been completely told the world may as
well shut up, for it will have nothing more to learn or to
live for, . .E.A.; The importers want to do all their biz.

Years ago hundreds of pounds used to chantre hinds of

M. : “Milestones” unavailable; no romance' in bald
truisms... O.: (8.J.); A popular mistake is the assump-
tion that Protection and direct taxation are incompatible.
The more a tariff protects home industry, the smaller the

trade monopoly. It “protects” the big importers from
the competition of smaller ones T<d C.: No; that
style useless....Seebohm : A journalist, as a rule, is
superior to his fellow-man in at least one respect. He
doesn’t puff out his chest to any great extent at the sight

No interest,... C.C.: Noted N. (Bris.): One may do.
S.S. : Send names. “A local steamship co.” is
too indefinite C.S.P. (Melbourne): Weshould hold. If
your bank does reduce interest it will thereby so much
improve its chance of one day paying the principal that

worst variety of barrister doesn’t perform like that ...
Swalon: Rhymes defective, metre incurable, grammar
very bad, story utterly dreary, humor hopeless, and idea
not original. Also too long. Pin came in handy, how-

four wrong spellings, five wrong punctuations, two gram-
matical mistakes, two metrical errors, and a false rhyme
into one verse Shadow: Billiard yarn disfigured by
beer and bad language ...S.J.C. : Can’t spare three
columns for essay on the “ meejum of exchange.” We
like our “meejum” in smaller quantities ...Edward
Francis: Will use in a condensed form .. .Caison : You
are evidently in a state of exalted mash. We are not—
not yet—so your effusion is viewed with contempt....
Tramp: All swagman verses are very much alike, and

lines worth printing for the sake of the alliteration :
Where, oh where, on Austral strand

Haughty Hodge with horny soul
Never gained the gilded goa l .
The rest is a blank ...A Stewart: Hardly worth the

In addition to being the finest country
property in Victoria, the St. Alban’s estate (Gee-
long) is one of the finest and most complete racing
establishments in the world. It is absolutely
unrivalled in Australia, and if there is a better
place in Europe no travelling Australian has yet
found it. The copious water-supply, the large
paddocks of English grasses, and the spick-and-
span completeness of the entire equine equipage
are at once the delight and the envy of every
breeder of horses who visits Mr. W. R. Wilson’s
famous property. Shelter sheds of large capacity
are placed in many of the paddocks, while, the year-
ling quarters consist of 40 loose boxes, cool and well
ventilated, built inquadrangularform, andof ample
size. Stone and brick tanks, windmills and feed-
bins are placed in convenient places in the various
paddocks, and the yards, &0., are amply and per-
fectly arranged. In the centre of the estate the
training-track and course proper are laid out (1|
miles and 1 mile 5 furlongs round respectively).
Both may well be compared to Flemington or
Rand wick, the going being good in all weathers.
The scraping-sheds are suitably placed, and an
elevated stand commands a perfect view of the
tracks, river, and the estate generally, with the
far-famed Barrabool Hills in the distance. The
stallion-boxes are lofty and well designed, opening
into a large covered-in exercise ground. Eeed
rooms, men’s rooms, &c., are under the same roof.
The training-stables, &c., contain 15 loose boxes,
feed rooms, men’s rooms, and every necessary
adjunct to a first-class establishment. Tha
out-buildings are extensive and ample. As
for the stock, they are worthy of the estab-
lishment. The sires include the celebrated Tren-
ton, Eiridspord (imported), Robinson Crusoe,
Strathmore and Bill of Portland (imported), and
a very long string of brood mares of distinguished
appearance and ancient lineage,While among the
list of racehorses appear such names as Carnage,
Havoc, Wallace, Challenger, Pilatus, Argent,
Steadfast, Bradford, Trentham, Nada, Warfare,
Conflict, Dillon and many others, all of splendid
appearance and the bluest of patrician blood. Both
the St. Alban’s estate and stud are to be distributed
by “Tattersall ” (Mr. George Adams) on the ait-
union principle at an early date, and a formal
announcement of this event is published else-
where. In this issue appear also a couple of
pictures taken in the St. Alban’s garden which
will serve to illustrate how far taste and wealth
can be employed in developing natural beauties.
Shareholders in the distribution will doubtless be
interested in knowing that the shares are being
taken up very rapidly, and the drawing will be an
event of the near future.

846 Macquarie-streeb North, Sydney,
May 21, 1895,
My Dear Moorabxnda—
Mr. Frederick Yilliers, the Most-Travelled
Smythe’s latest exhibit—who was entertained by
a number of representative pressmen at a pleasant
pionic at the Hawkesbury last Sunday—cub a very
taking figure at Sydney Centenary Hall the other
Wednesday, when a huge and three-parts-mascu-
line audience came forth to have anew light cast
upon Celestial suffering, and to revel, as it were,
in purple patches of gore. It almost looks as if
masculine as well as feminine dress-reform were a
howling necessity when a fine, upstanding male,
beautifully dressed in a loose grey suit with fairly
full knickers, coarse, warm stockings, and lace-up
boots, has to apologise to his hearers for not wear-
ing a boiled shirt with a ruby solitaire and a
willie-wagtail like a waiter. People who can dis-
play breezy, unskewered outlines should always
be welcome as flowers in May, no matter how the
fashions go.
The war-correspondent is the image of his Bul-
letin portrait—fierce, out-curving moustache and
all, and the only thing I didn’t like about his tout
ensemble on the Toreador-draped platform was the
communication - wire which you occasionally
detected running from the great man to the o.p.
side. He never seemed to use it—only hung on to
it in a way which rather gave him the appearance
of being on a string. As for his talk—he has the
English accent rather badly, and if many more of
these weary-voiced youths come to our shores to
talk in a worn-out way, the old saying about Aus-
tralians being born tired will need reversal. And
I would also like to warn Mr. Yilliers, and any
other itinerant talker who happens to be listening,
that no man who wants to be respected in Aus-
tralia should ever tell funny stories about how a
blind Chinese mule sent him to grass in one
flourish.
I liked Mr. Yilliers’ discourse, which Australia
has the privilege of sampling before England
does. As the lecturer omits all technicalities, and
never explains stratagems and tactics in camp-
language, his talk is delightfully explicit, from a
woman’s point of view. The discourse, and most
of the realistic photos, taken on the spot, are very
gory; it is in the main real tragedy one is listen-
ing to and looking at, but perhaps the show
would have been a failure otherwise. The photos,
of Jap. officers evoked feminine admiration.
They certainly looked neat in their German
uniforms —but the figure I was specially attracted
to was one of a group of Chinese stewards, who
had on the most perfectly-cut leg-of-mutton sleeve
I have ever seen in my life.
Quite a number of balls are billed to happen
before one has time to turn round three times.
The third annual dance, in aid of the R.O. Church,
Rand (which was such a success last year),
will be held in Paddington Town Hall on Wed-
nesday, 29th inst. Mrs. Humphrey Oxenham
(Mr. Oxenham bought the late Gov. Duff’s
carriage- horses, by the'way) and Mrs. T. Payten
are hon. secs., and tickets are five shillings.
Another five-shilling dance will be held at Need’s
rooms in aid of the piano-fund for the Children’s
Diphtheria Hospital, on Friday evening. 14th prox.
It is alleged that children are fond of music, and
that it is therefore necessary for the nurses to
have a piano. Mrs. F. Lamb and Nurse Proctor

year, and I am told that the committee mean to
surpass even that success. Then the Fresh Air

triumphant denouement, and the Tempe ball

One public hop that will be missed is the Boys’
Brigade ball, which will not, I hear, be held this
season, although there seems more need for it than
ever since the 8.8. is £2OO in debt. But it appears
that this deserving institution, which gave the
always pathetic street arab a chance to grow into
a decent man, is going to be wound up, as the
elder boys and youths have fallen away and left
the institute to be carried on by a crowd of small
and respectable youngsters who would be much
better at home (as the Acting-Governor opined),
and who were incapable of controlling the affairs
of the club. So the Boys’ Brigade is doomed, for
I don’t think the scheme to start it again on a
smaller scale will win many supporters.
A conversazione to welcome the clear-seeing
new Chancellor (Judge Windeyer) to the arms of
his alma mater will eventuate in the great hall
of Sydney ’Varsity, on Wednesday, May 29th, at
8.15 p.m. There is a very strong general com-
mittee who are working hard to make the affair a
success, as the Chancellor, in at least one of his
several capacities, just now requires all the coun-
tenance which can be commanded. Tickets are

The human body is a victim to those
dreadful enemies, the microbes, and to prevent
those treacherous foes to approach you there is no
better method than to keep yourself clean and not
allow food to decay in your mouth or the clogging
of the epidermis. To prevent these things, one of
the most leading chemists in Sweden brought out
his world-renowned Amykos, which, without
doubt, is the best toilet requisite with which to
arargle your throat, wash your mouth and face.
Amykos is strongly recommended as a preventa-
tive of sore throat and bad breath.
ladies and undergrads.”—two divisions of society
which don’t appear to me to have much in
common, and certainly don’t deserve to be dumped
together at 2s. 6d. per caput. Such a classifica-
tion will, I am sure, be resented quite as fiercely
by the undergrads, as by the ladies.
The departure of Lady Duff and her daughters
on the first stage of their journey to England, last
Friday afternoon, was a very doleful proceeding.
It was a dismally web and depressing evening, and
no preparations had been made by the railway
authorities to keep the platform clear, as was done
when the Jerseys left. Consequently a very
higgledy-piggledy crowd —including a number of
aggressive women who evidently wanted to be
violently sympathetic with Lady D. and weep
sisterly tears all over her crape—swarmed round
the sleeping-carriage (the vice-regal snow-white
car wasn’t trotted out) and had to be thrust back
by heavy-weight porters to allow of a path as
wide as my sash ribbon, on the extreme edge of
the platform, being kept clear for Lady Duff and
her party. The train weighed in directly the ex-
vioe-regalities were on board, and so mercifully
cub short a very hipped sorb of ceremony.
Lady Duff, looking pale and sad, and keeping
her head bent, was nob over-trimmed with crape,
and her black dress was simply made for the
voyage in coab-and-skirb style ; a small black crape
bonnet for head-gear. She was escorted by Acting-
Gov. Darley, and accompanied by Mrs. Edward
Hatton—in a quiet black dress with some violets
in her hat. Pretty Miss Kate Duff, in black with
a black gem hat and veil, was escorted by Major-
General Hutton, and the other vice-regal girls
made a gloomy group in their mourning frocks. I
suppose that the deep veil of sadness that
hung over Lady Duff’s departure was regarded as
precluding anything like a demonstrative send-off.
Bub, etiquette or not, I think a few warm farewell
cheers wouldn’t have been amiss to bid goodbye
to a woman who has had a great deal of trouble
on her shoulders, and who didn’t beg the question
when a heavy sorrow was sheeted home to her. I
am sure everybody at the station wished her bon-
voyage, and it seemed a pity that somebody with
good lungs didn’t say so. The Sydney public—
generally so hearty—behaved on this occasion like
a set of spooks.
Lady Norman and Miss Norman are Lady
Duff’s fellow-passengers to England in the Vic-
toria, and Bananaland’s Governor accompanied
his wife and daughter round the coast which he,
too, will quit finally in a few months. There was
a goodly passenger-list of notables who had timed
their voyages with a prescient eye to the advan-
tages of travelling in “ the best of society.” For
if Mrs. Longsleever’s ancestors didn’t come over
with the Normans, it is nice for her to be able to
say that she herself went back with them, any-
way. The Northern vice-royalties have always
been unpretentious and popular, too; and Bris-
bane Grhvmentouse society, during their rule, was
a sufficiently happy family.
People are fond of saying that Governor’s wives
are important personages, and so they are while
they may reflect His Excellency the Governor’s
glory, dla sun and moon. But when H.E. is re-
moved from the scene, down falls Her Ex. from
her high official estate —even the supply of banners
and national anthem is cut off short. Everything
is profoundly plain—even the military daren’t
sport all I heir fancy-work—which proves that the
official status for a Governor’s widow is as good
as nil. Let conceited vice-regal women remember
this when they think they really run the country
because they are more fluent than their husbands.
“ Katherine,” the operetta by Signor Lardelli
and Mrs. Margery Browne, was produced and la
cantata at Sydney Town Hall last Thursday even-
ing, with a very flattering amount of success, con-
sidering there were no dialogues, scenery,
or costumes. The hall was very full, and
some parts of the operetta were heard to
great advantage—notably Katherine’s plaintive
and pretty song “ How passing sweet,”
it is to love,” the doctor’s song and the poet’s
song; the duo (Katherine and Archibald), “Dare
I for her favor pray?” Likewise the soprano
aria, “Now rides the moon in all her regal splen-
dor,” and several more, including the interpolated
“Semper Fidelis”—tenor solo, which created quit©
an effect, and as sung by Mr. Leston, was en-
thusiastically encored.
I think that “ Katherine’s ” weakness as a comio
opera is that it isn’t comic. The composer admits
it isn’t, and still he bills it on the book of words
as a comic opera, and when you invite people to
eggs and bacon and give ’em champagne and
oysters it is naturally difficult for them to adapt
themselves to the situation all at once. lam told
(by some perhaps unauthorised person) that
hungry hiatuses are left in the dialogue (burlesque
style) in order to give the gagger a free
line. I haven’t seen any of the dialogue myself,
and I haven’t met anybody who has, but the songs
and choruses are fairly lucid, if not exactly
brilliant—the meaning is all on the surface, and
neither satire, epigram, nor double meaning has
any place therein. Speaking honestly, the music
deserves a better book. The choruses (not even
decently rendered on Friday—you cannot get up
an operetta with four rehearsals) would go with a
splendid swing if they were given half a chance.
Hecate’s music is perhaps the weakest in the
score —it lacks savageness and inclines to see-saw.
Miss Violet Birkenhead, Mrs. (Dr.) Edwards,
Messrs. Frank Adams, George and Harry
Leston, and an unknown baritone first tackled
“Katherine” in public, with Rivers Allpress as
first violin and Lardelli shaking the stick at ’em.
“Dorothy” went delightfully at Sydney Lyceum
on Saturday before a crowded audience—with, as
luck would have it, the handsomest gown in the
house happily placed in the front row. This gown,
worn by a well-known society woman, was of
black silk with a bodice of black dotted in gold
and fancifully embroidered in glistening golden
flowers both back and front. It was not perhaps
the sort of gown a wise woman would wear to the
“Mikado,” but anywhere else it would always
take the odd trick. A gay-looking d.c. pair were
a soldier and lady—he in red and she in red, like
two faithful tomatoes on one spray. Yet really,
when a woman is doomed to escort a gaudy full-
fig lobster—l mean warrior—it is generally safest
to match him unless you want to set the onlookers’
teeth on edge.
There were one or two discrepancies about the
Dorothy dressing. Nellie S. in a sallow skirt and
a very moderate hat trimmed in a middle-class
way with poppies, wasn’t a patch on her old self
in lavender-blue with hoops of velvet and swarms
of field-flowers all about; but Flo. Young, in
tortoise-shell tints, was nice enough. In the
second act Nellie Stewart was arrayed like a copy
in millinery of the Milky Way, all white with
starry sleeves ; and Flo. Young, in white, artis-
tically draped with chiffon, was furthermore
adorned with crowds of little violets. Brownlow
(in mellow voice for the pUce de resistance, “Queen
of My Heart,” which gained a howling recall—
Mr. B.’s voice, by the way, has developed extra-
ordinary staying-power as contrasted with his
previous Sydney performances) cub a great dash as
Harry Sherwood —especially in the pearl-colored
satin suit richly broidered in gold-and-silyer
thread and terminating in silk stockings. Beside
this finely-feathered warbler, tenor Tapley, in a
green-stuff coat moderately embroidered, and a
blue ribbon round his neck, looked more like the
duke’s friend than the duke himself. Mr. Tapley,
I notice, has only one way of suggesting naughti-
ness, which he expressed by wiping his intellectual
nose. A tendency to titivate one’s proboscis with
a giddy lace handkerchief is a sign of great larki-
ness according to the stage gospel of the “ gentle-
manly tenor.”
Contrary to my expectations (I never expect
much from a piece of music which comes to you
tied up with pink ribbon), Miss Annie Summer-
belle’s new song, “Unrest” (words by Goethe,
translated by Longfellow), is distinctly clever and
melodious. The song is for contralto, mezzo-
soprano, or baritone—it has been sung with great
success by Deslouis, and is altogether worthy of
the encomiums passed upon it by that excellent
judge. The grandeur of the words goes without
saying, and the melody is written in the plaintive
key of F very simply and gracefully. Altogether,
Miss Summerbelle has concocted a most dignified
song.
Give us this day our daily waltz. The little list
of original music for this week includes the
“ Boronia,” by E. J. Peterson, gaudily illustrated
in primal colors on the outside, and set to a
humble little tune (but still a tune) with fairly
good rhythm. The “ Harbor ” waltz, by Elsie
Gerrard, dedicated to Lady Hopetoun (why nob
to the more imminent and aquatic Lady Brassey?)
is the work of a lady who might some day—after
much musical wrestling of spirit—turn out some-
thing worth printing; but the “ Harbor” does not
strike me as that something, although the band
did play it at the S.T.C. races. Paling & Cos.
send me the “Naval Waltz,” by Daphne, which
strikes me as being well-named. Anybody who
has struggled with a member of the unterpsichorean
navy will see exactly where the point comes in.
The “Norman Waltz” —dedicated to Gov. Nor-
man by Lily Macalister, who florally interprets
her front-name on the cover —is the kind of com-
position which will probably gain more admirers
among the composer’s friends than among the
general public ; and perhaps the nicest feature
about the watery “ Waratah ” waltz, by Ward
Harrison, is that it isn’t dedicated to the nearest
duke.

duces a comedy by Sheridan, “The Critic,” pre-

TheS.U.D.S. seems to outlive all the other amateur
grease-painters—its admirers consider this another
proof of the survival of the fittest, I suppose.
But I hope the clever “ Magpie Club ” will soon
give us a taste of its quality.
Talking of amateur acting reminds me that a
pretty Australian society maiden, whose histrionic
ability is beyond ail question, has broken off her
engagement with an equally stage-stricken warrior
—to nobody’s astonishment, by the way.
A certain Sydney youth, just returned Irom a
continental tour, has certainly brought back a
new version of the generally-longed-for story.
Asked what he thought of London, he replied
earnestly that the whisky was no different there
from anywhere else ; and, as for Paris, he stopped
only four hours in the conf unded place, and
caught the first boat back. Refreshing, after the
paddockful of Anglo-Australians whose hearts are
in Yewrope for evermore, dontcherknow, when
once they have six weeks in London.
My Melb. correspondent The celestial vision
of a gown which lovely Maude Hobson wore in
the first act of “In Town” has been replaced by
one the color of sea-foam, lightly trimmed with
rare lace and opal-tinted ribbons. If Miss Hobson
would disclose the name of the artist who creates
her frocks, that gifted person’s fortune would be
made. But she keeps the name quite secret.
Yours affectionately,

He ascribes them to Oscar’s craze for notoriety at

There were several hideous instances, at
the Davitt reception in Melb., of the average
human being’s lack of sense of proportion. Four
orators, of whom only Trenwith reaches any high
level, preceded Davitt’s acknowledgments, after
which, instead of neatly closing the proceedings, a
further string of speeches was imposed on the
afflicted audience and on Davitt by a group of gas-
bags that began with Hancock, filtered through
Max Hirsch, and reached its sediment in Prender-
gast. Then Dr, O’Donnell made things ridicu-
lous, when speaking of Davitt’s Adelaide recep-
tion, by telling how the visitor was shown through
the empty House of Parliament, had the Fire
Brigade turn out for his edification, &c., &c., con-
cluding with the ludicrous utterance that, “ had
there been a proper Governor there (poor little
Way !), he (Dr. O’D.) believed that Davitt would
have been invited to Govt. House! ” How
Davitt must smile? Apropos, Moran, member for
Yilgarn (W.A.), accompanied Davitt from Perth,
and was on the platform at the Melb. reception,
where he spread himself out largely, and expressed
his intention of attending every Australian public
appearance Davitt makes. As Moran is apparently
a young man suffering from swelled head, with a
propensity to declare himself “a loyal British
subject,” and, furthermore, exaggerates the risk
run by public association with Davitt, The
Bulletin hopes that, if he doesn’t go home soon,
he will be effectually suppressed. Making due
allowance for the Snowdens of this stricken coun-
try, Davitt is still likely to suffer, nob from a
scarcity, bub from a plethora of politicians anxious
to advertise themselves by standing on the shadow
he recklessly throws on the floor.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Interprovinoial Eight-oar race, rowed last
Saturday, should bring about an Immediate settlement
of the amateur rowing status throughout the Australias.
Victoria rowed a cash cyclist, against whom the N.S.W.
rowing association entered a protest, and instructed its
crew, in the event of the non-withdrawal of the man ob-
jected to, not to start. Victoria declined to withdraw
the man, and the N.S.W. crew, ignoring instructions
from head-quarters, started, and received a drubbing
from the Victorians, who have now won 14 out of 19 races,
the other five being divided between N.S.W (4) and
Bananaland (1).
N.S.W. starts cash boat-sailers in its crews, bull
declines to accept cash cyclists from other provinces.
The time has now come when some definite arrangement
must be decided upon, at least as regards the inter-
provincial annual raos.
The N.S.W, crew made a mistake in start-
ing in defiance of the Association’s instructions, but it was
a weak crew, and probably the majority of its members
looked upon the race as the first and only one in which
they were likely to represent their province, so they
decided to do or die at all hazards. That any of them
will again have a chance of ignoring head-quarters is
unlikely.
N.S. Wales has ever been at a disadvantage
with Victoria as regards the amateur status. Victoria
has proved herself far and away before N.S.W. in amateur
oarsmen, but N.S.W. has “lost” her rival in profes-
sionals, and the reason does not take much finding. If a
manual-laborer shows good form in Victoria he is received
open-armed by the amateurs, but in N.S.W. there is no
course open to a good man who labors save to join the
professional ranks. Asa matter of fact, about the only
two bona-fide professionals Victoria has turned out were
the Edwards brothers. Take any line of sport requiring
strength and staying power, the very best of non-
laboring men are paddocks behind the best professionals,
who, almost without exception, have come from the
laboring classes.
* « ♦ *
The interprovincial ’Varsity eight-oar race, this
year rowed in Adelaide, was a gift for N.S.W., even the
scratch S.A. crew beating Vic., although a protest by the
latter against S.A. for fouling was upheld, and placed
them second. N.S.W. romped away from the start and
won by six lengths. The Vio. crew were very raw, and
were badly shown up. Even the S.A. crew, a collection
of mere boys, exhibited better form.

recruits.

The Australian “Lady Cricketers’ Club” (after
playing four matches, the last at Lilydale (Vic.), when it
barely cleared exs.) is defunct. It was announced that
half the proceeds of each match would go to charity, but
the objection raised to the publication of a balance-sheet,
as suggested by the press, has been a factor in damping
prospects and causing the cancellation of several fixtures.

The biggest and heaviest of silver cups—it cost,
say, between £BO and £IOO-has stood for years in aFlem-
ington (Vic.) pub. It was sent out in the wild Boom-time
as a whisky trophy, to be run for by amateurs only ; but
when it arrived there were no amateurs and it never was
competed for. It is idle to attempt to resurrect pedestri-
anisra. The lamb has lost too much skin.

“Who is Mr. H. A. Thompson, the newly-

and what are his qualifications for the position ?’’ The
Bulletin is told that Mr. Thompson is a gentleman much
esteemed and respected by his personal friends, and hat
he holds the very best of-qualifioations from an A.J.O.
point of view. He is a Union Club man, an auctioneer,
and sells racehorses in conjunction with Mr. T. S. Clib-
born, the A.J.C. secretary. Mr. Thompson does not
appear to be known to the rank-and-file of the racing
public, but if he understands the business he has taken in
hand this will not necessarily prove a disadvantage.

Race meetings on three successive Saturdays will
be held at Randwiok, under the auspices of the S.T.C.,
Tatt.’s Club, and the A.J.O. respectively, ere the curtain
falls on the racing season.
At the S.T.C. Birthday meeting, Bungebah may
be considered leniently treated with Bst. 111 b. for the
Royal Stakes, though, when it is all over, either Ruenalf,
The Captain, or Solanum may win.
For the Birthday Cup the disappointing New-
man will likely start a warm favorite, but a mile and a
quarter is probably this gay deceiver’s distance, despite
his wonderful track-trials over a distance of ground.
Ruenalf, if especially reserved, is sure to run forward,
and Oremorne may do better than is indicated by his
present starting-price. The dogged Clive is sure to stay
out the mile and a half, and should much trouble Noble-
man.
Redavni (“Invader” reversed) should about
win the Nursery Handicap to-day (Saturday). Mr. Keys
favors this curious mode of nomenclature—Ruenalf to wit.
Yellow Plush, a stable companion of the flying
Georgia and Tiwoona, is whispered about (in the street) as
a “good thing” for the Royal Stakes.

A chunk of solemn balderdash from Melb. Age :
“ While Carbine is on his way to England, where it is to
be hoped he will perpetuate the fame of the Australian
thoroughbred, the Chester Cup has been won by the son
Of a foreign sire, and the fact will further demonstrate to
the racing men of the old country that t here are good
horses to be found outside England, and that the English
thoroughbred does not deteriorate through expatriation.
Carbine is as English as they can make era out of Eng-
land. therefore, as an advt. for Australian horses, he will
not go far. Otherwise the paragraph is 30 years behind
its time. Gladiateur, a French descendant of French
parents, won the Epsom Derby in 1805. In the early
“eighties” Iroquois and Foxhall, thoroughbred Ameri-
cans, were the two best three-year-olds in England
Before then a wonderful mare had come from Hungary to
teach the “old country” racing men som“thing which
the Age has only just discovered. They hack horses from
abroad with their good stuff. The first favorite for the
Cambridgeshire, the biggest betting race of the English
season, has been a French-bred one on several occasions.

Avrovos of the low price of horses in Queens-
land and the North generally, it is not generally I known
that Indiana (U.S.A.) boasts an establishment for the
slaughter and pickling of horses. Immense quantities of

The latest Melb. gambling craze is the “3d. in
the slot ” poker card-playing machine, which rests upon
most of the hotel bars at present, and on the insertion of
the orthodox church coin shows various hands of cards,
entitling the speculator to from nought to 50 cigars
firenerally nought). A protest from the churches is
expected! as all the threepenny-bits in the city are find-
ing their way into the coffers of the machine proprietors.
Gambling on a big scale also goes on at the machine, one
leading Melb. bookmaker being credited with losing £SOO
the other day. The writer has during the last few nights
seen over EIOO changing hands in Is., 2s. 6d., and ss.
pools and one chirpy Thespian dropped in one evening
his fortnight’s pay. The machines are continually sur-

gambling apparatus that they forget their thirst, and
compel numerous reminders from the barmaids as to the
original purpose of them visit. #
The election of Mr. Gully, M.P. (a somewhat
able Q.C -but undistinguished parliamentarian), as
Speaker of the English Commons, again calls to mind his
grandfather, John Gully, English pugilist and M.P.
Gullv held the title of champion of England on very
shallow grounds, his only two notable fights being with a
rushing giant named Gregson, a man without any preten-
sions to championship form. Both big, powerful men
their m *etings were slogging matches pure and simple, of
a desp rate nature certainly, but devoid of the science
and finesse shown by such men as Tom Spring, Oribb,
Molyneux, the Dutch Sams, pere et fils, the Belchers,
Savers Lino-ham, Mace, and many others. Gully wisely
retired on his scanty laurels to go into the bruiser s
Mecca a pub. He had luck on the turf, and ultimately
bought an English estate-and a seat in Parliament. To
sum Gully up in bald English, he was a powerful rough-
and-tumble fighter, and a successful professional gambler.

There was a great kangaroo-hunt recently
between Wilcannia and White Cliffs. The pastoral country
for scores of miles is almost bare, having long been over-
stocked ; but a selection, at times flooded, carries feed two
feet high. Kangaroos have mustered here literally by the
thousand ; and, as they were eating, out the homestead
lessee he organised this hunt. A thousand of the animals
were yarded, but the fences broke, and many escaped. As
they were breaking away the horsemen rode in amongst
them and several “old men” turned and unhorsed
their pursuers. But it is not in many parts of the country
that this can be done now.

Bowling in Calcutta is gorgeous in its laziness.
There is no shifting of mats, no throwing of jacks, and-
no picking-up of bowls! Long strips of canvas are laid
right across the ends of the green and from this the
players bowl. A native boy carries the jack back, and
each player is provided with a boy, who picks up the
bowl and places it in his hand. While not engaged in
delivering their bowls the players recline in luxurious
seats and drink whisky and soda. The only exertion
during the whole game is the delivery of the bowl and the
walking down to the opposite

One of the carters of a certain big Sydney
warehouse drives a fine coaching mare which has never
had a foal, but nevertheless has given a quart of milk

ready to milk the mare and confound the unbeliever.

A M.L. bush farmer lately ordered from a tailor

in Brisbane last week to encourage the others,

“ Crom-a-boo,” the irresistibly funny and
rollicking Irish song of the Hoben Brothers, which
Sappho Smith opined would prove “a terrible-
success,” is already proving. Lonnen has taken
it up in London, and Lauri is to sing it in
Australia; it is to be well introduced in America,
and in Maoriland, where that clever comedian,
Percy, of the Pollard Lilliputians, is making a
feature of it. It is also a universal success and
heard everywhere. Paling’s have already cleared
the first big edition, and have got out two others

football-song ever written, and the press every-

Dear Bulletin, —Can you mention one
bush poet who is not —broadly speaking—pessi-
mistic and despairingly introspective ? “ Banjo ”
you can count out, as he is not a bush poet of the
bush, a distinction with a difference. The bush is
pleasant as a contemplation and a gracious re-
miniscence, but as a habitation its sameness, in-
tense loneliness and lack of communication with
kindred spirits must be, at most times, “dumb
hell ’’ to the poetic temperament.—Tkkble B.
Sydney P.M. : “ What did you say when
defendant collided with you?” “Well, I don’t
like to repeat the words, your Worship.” Magis-
trate : “You must repeat them.” Witness:
“ Well, I said, ‘ Look here, if you don’t blanky
well move out of the blanky way, I’ll blanky
well,’ etc.” Magistrate: “And what did the
defendant say ?” _ Witness: “Well, I am afraid,
your Worship, his remarks were utterly unfit for
publication.”
Rarely does the Chow suffer in his dealings
with the white. A digger one day entered a
Chinese store with his great boot swung over his
shoulder —as was the old fashion : “A bottle
pickles, John, and just you be quick.” As the
mild pagan turned to get a bottle the digger seized
one from a shelf near him and slipped it down his
boot. A bit of looking-glass revealed the fraud
to John, who quietly turned and handed him
another bottle. “How muchee, John?” “Four
shilling,” promptly returned the heathen. “Get
out of that yer dirty swindlin’ Chinee—four
shillings for a bottle of pickles!” “Two shillin’
this bottle, two shillin’ bottle in hoot !” The
noble white man paid in silence, and John did
not make more than 150 per cent.
The well-known Mr. James Stedman, of
Kent-straet, 145 Clarence-street, and 391 George-
street, Sydney, issues a gorgeous and lavishly-
illustrated catalogue, dealing with his “Lion
Brand ” confectionery. Mr. Stedman’s factory is
noted as by far the largest of its kind in Austral-
asia, and there he turns out vast quantities of
every known kind of confectionery. The biggest
trade, of course, is in the ordinary boiled lollies—
mixtures, sticks, bull’s-eyes, drops, &c., the kinds
which are made by boiling great masses of sugar,
wifi coloring matter and flavoring essences
added, and then turning out the resulting
syrup to cool on a table, and rolling it up into
r >pes when half-cold, and dragging them out by
h mging them on a hook and hauling at the ends,
and other curious sleight-of-hand tricks. The
rest of the output consists of lozenges, Scotch
mixtures, almonds, creams, chocolates, fondants,
jujubes, pastilles, ginger, and several billion other
trifles. There are ten main departments in the
i ictory, and in addition to manufacturing on a
large scale Mr. Stedman keeps a buyer in Europe
who sends out every novelty in the market. The
total output equals many tons daily—how many it
would be difficult to say, but the busi less, which
has long been the largest of its kind in these pro-
vinces, is still growing, and seems likely to in-
crease to an indefinite extent, and it furnishes
employment to several hundred work-people. The
catalogue, which, as already mentioned, is an
especially elegant and costly work of art, was
turned out by Penfold and Cos., of Sydney.

Northern bushmen are discussing the ant-
hill problem. In the North all ant-mounds lean
towards the west. It is alleged that the ants
build their homes when their enemies are not
about, and when the dew moistens the surface of
the earth. The west side is the cooUst and
dampest, and, therefore, the ants work there
longest, and thus give their houses a westerly
trend. Can any Bulletin reader explain the
phenomenon otherwise?

a last hope; obtained some of Herr Rassmussen s Purely Herbal Alfaline Vitality 1 ills,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured M ® wffhin a few weeks, an
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. Ihe Alfaline Pills
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.

mony carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr Rassmussen. -Dear Sir,- I think it my duty to

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Here Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper o)
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
J 3 CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen, August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheet -
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had n
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good I riday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY,

To Herr Rassmusskn.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish. Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline Universal Pills cured me, when all other remedies and
doctors failed, of a stubborn ease of Debility of 18 years’ standing. My
wish is fulfilled at last, and I don’t know how to thank you enough.
Dear Sir, I shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies to all sufferers I
come across. You are quite at liberty to publish or make what use you
like of this testimonial, and anyone writing to me will have full
particulars. I am, yours respectfully, Mrs. E. SMITH, Port Mac-
quarie, Hastings River, N.S.W.

Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a very obstinate internal com-

strong as any young man, and shall always be grateful to you.
Yours very truly, N. LARSEN.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heeiCC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cqt the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. If you have a long thin font, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS'S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a.

INDIGESTION
And Liver Complaint
CURED BY USING
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkerville, S. Australia, writes:
“ Six years ago, I had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. 1 tried
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
mv customers recommended Ayer’s barsapa-
rilla: it helped me from the first,—in fact,
after taking six bottles 1 was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep like
a child.”

“ I am dying,” said the poet, to the friend who
held his hand;
“ I shall never be remembered by my footprints
on the sand ;
But write upon my tombstone when I ve flitted
far from hence ;
‘ This Bard, at least, was Guiltless of one Popular
Offence.’
“ The meaning of my verses it was easy to divine.
Men guessed what word was coming at the end of
any line,
And the metre short and simple didn t keep them
in suspense,
But I’ll swear that I am guiltless of one popular
offence.”

IMPORTANT NOTICE; TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ TIEHR-lEIE CASTLES” and “ G-A-IPSTJAZCT.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “ Three Castles” and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“TLree Castles” and “ Capstan.” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

“ The use of a good Soap is certainly calculated to
preserve the skin in health, to maintain its complexion

Queensland’s success with its loan is and is not
a lesson to Australia. The floating of any Australian
loan except locally is a mistake—a reckless addition to
the absentee burden of the country. But, if flickering
politicians must go to London for capital, it is well when
they refuse to pay usury. Q.’s public debt before the last
addition stood at £32,073,034, according to the returns at
30th June,’94. On this sum O. pays £1,255,785 per annum
for interest—at the a\ erage rate of 391 per cent. If the
interest on the debt were reduced to 3J per cent, the
saving per annum would be £133,229.
• • • • • •
Tasmania’s debt at the same date was £7,645,604
and interest £310,263 per annum—comparatively small in
bulk, but larger per inhabitant than Vic. and N.S.W.
Tas. would save £42,667 on a 34 per cent, basis.
Excluding its Treasury Bills in aid of revenue
(£1,903,000), N.S.W. had, in January, ’94, a public debt
of i'56,176.149, on which she pays annukl interest of
£2,150,922. This is at the rate of 3-83 per cent. If the
loan were consolidated and the rate of Interest reduced
to3J per cent-., ihe living would be £181,757 per annum.
Similarly with Vitoria, the publiudebt(exclud-
I reas cry billß £750,000) was, in July, 94,
£46,547,708, on which £1,828,447 is paid in interest—at
the rate of 3*93 per cent. The saving by a reduction
to 3i per cent, would be £199,277 per annum ! _
’ . T , n . " . '
b. A., in Jan., 94, paid at the high rate of 4'05
per cent, on £22,252,590, and would save £122,746 per
annum by a reduction of its interest to 3J per cent,
This excludes £850,000 Treasury Bills.
. ’ ‘ ’
M.L. owed, in March, ’94, £39,826,415 and pays
thereon at 4 - 03 per cent.—namely, £1,605,466. Reduction
to 3i per cent, would mean an annual saving of £211,540.
£1,000,000 of accumulated sinking fund is not
here taken into account.)
* ' ‘ *
The foregoing figures are not actually up-to-
date. In the present ohaotio arrangement of the finances
it is impossible for anyone not in the confidence of the
seven Treasuries to calculate accurately either the debt or
the interest. The figures used assume the debt (including
Treasury bills) at £210,344,517, and the interest thereon
at £8,300,567. Australasia pays at the rate of about 3 - 95
per cent, on its borrowings— a ridiculous price to p?y the
foreign creditor. A reduction to 3J per cent, would mean
a saving of over £930,000 per annum. A reduction to
3J per cent, would mean over £1,400,000, and to 3 per
cent. £1,990,000 per annum,
♦ * * •
The vague rumor that anew Vic. loan was to be
floated brought a rush of Melb. bankers and financiers to
Premier Turner’s office, offering to take up a 3J per cent.
loan of almost any amount at par. This is another evi-
dence of the foolishness of every Australian Govt, which
borrows on the London market. That market, so
far as can be gauged by the late Queensland loan
offers just about the same terms as the local ones,
And the advantages of the local market are that it saves a
heavy outlay each half-year in the matter of exchange
when remitting the interest; another heavy outlay
for expenses when the “conversion ” comes round; a
third outlay for “management,” “inscription,” and so
oh; that it is close at hand, so that the Treasurer can
watch it hirahelf and seize the favorable moment for con-
version operations ; that it saves the Intervention of the
British middleman who squeezes this country so
vigorously at every possible opportunity ; and that it will
keep the greater part, at all events, of the interest in the
country.
The common impression that the investment of
Australian money in Govt, debentures would only prevent
its investment in something else, and thus cripple: enter-
prise, is altogether erroneous. As an example, the Bank
of New South Wales now holds something like £5,000,000
in cash, which is absolutely idle and useless, and does no
more to promote enterprise while lying in the bank’s
cellars than a tombstone would do in the same situation,
It keeps this vast amount locked up in case of a run,
simply because there are no interest-earning securities in
which it oan be invested and which would always be realis-
able in a sudden emergency. If either Vie. or N.S.W.
placed its loans locally, and established a regular Aus-

all its engagements regularly, the depositors are thus
(allowing for the recent fall in interest) receiving, between
interest and dividend, fully 1 per cent. more than they
would have done if there had been no reconstruction. As
for the ordinary shareholders, they had £5 written off
each share, were struck by a heavy call, and have no
viable prospect of dividends, principally through the
heavy payments which have to be made to the “fixed”
depositors and preference shareholders. And naturally
they feel very ordinary indeed under the circumstances,

President Cleveland sold the last U.S. loan by
tender to a syndicate of bankers at £lO4, and the syndi-
cate straightway sold it retail to the suffering community
at £l2O. The syndicate system is the same old swindle
every time. If a country must borrow, the bonds should
be sold to the public over the Treasury counter like any
other merchandise, the price being fixed in advance at
the highest rate the market seems able to stand. Or else
they should be auctioned in instalments by Sol. Isaacs, at
the second-hand furniture emporium,

The success of the Maoriland 3 per cent), loan

In Auckland and Wellington (M.L.) any amount
of money can now be obtained On mortgage at 5 per
cent., and the old wheeze about capital being driven out
of the country is nearly dead. The rates came down
with a thud even before the State Loan Department got
fairly afloat, and because they are down the Tory press
points out energetically that the cheap money system is
quite unnecessary, money having become cheaper with-
out it. But the country knows better. It wants the
State Loan Department now, not so much to make money
cheap, as to prevent it again becoming dear.
It is not easy to swindle the Maoriland Customs.
The landing waiters very often pick on any of fche old
merchant houses, and examine package after package, no
matter how long it takes. As for “having” them on
drawbacks— the invoice is stamped with the collector’s
seal when the goods are imported ; and only forgery can
countervail that precaution. Also, an officer examines
the packages, and if repacked, contents must be taken
out and packed in his view.
A Western correspondent: In boom-time an
Australian trader sold out his business for over six
figures. When the sale was completed he put on his hat
and marched out of his warehouse without taking leave
of one of his numerous employes, some of whom had
served him for 30 years—nor has he since then ever con-
descended to recognise one of them in the street. Such
are the things which endear master to servant.

Dear Bulletin, — A priest told me this: “A
while ago,” he said, “ I called on the manager of an insur-
ance 00. ‘I have come,’ I said, ‘to hand to you £BS
reparation from one who came to clear himself of his sins
before God. The balance of the £IOO he got from you he
handed to your agent according to agreement made at the
time when his proposal to insure in your co. was
accepted.’ I may tell you—-this to me—that to my know-
ledge this arrangement is frequently made by agents of
insurance co.’s who hint, even if they do not say it out-
right, that in the event of a fire—and here they wink
knowingly at the proposer—they will report favorably on
the case, and they can square it up together. Anyhow,
that is what happened in this case.” Which explains a
lot of things. — Yours, VVurby M.

Dear Bulletin, — Be that Westralian prospect-
ing party which left Victoria only to return a failure.
What else could be expected ? One of them believed in
the divining-rod, another was an aggressive atheist, three
others were Sunday-school superintendents. The direc-
tors picked the party in spite of the protests of the leader,
and there was dissension before they left Ballarat. The
00. was to provide “outfit.” The three S.S.S. insisted
on being provided with bound copies of Moody and
Sankey, on the grounds that these were as essential to
their welfare and happiness as tobacco to the other two.
And the directors, being built that way, said a prayer over
the good young men and gave them the hymn books.—

On the Murchison the hope of striking a rich
reef or leader, or even a color, is never lost right down to
the grave. One morning, during the Evster holidays, a
man was found dead in his tent at Cue, and in the after-
noon his funeral took place, the sad turn-out consisting
of a vehicle that carried the poor clay and two or three
followers or mourners. At the cemetery there was a
sudden halt in the sentimental on account
of the grave-digger rooting out a piece of stone which
was anxiously examined and vigorously spat upon by
some of those present, as there was no water available for
washing the dirt off and making visible the specks, it
any. Then it was passed round and inspected by the
officiating parson, who said he considered it good-looking
stone. However, no gold being visible and the assem-
blage being satisfied that a good mine wasn’t being filled
in again, the burial-service began, and the dead miner
was planted.

Thirty members of the British House of

The whole United Kingdom is splitting its

The Westralian Year-Book for ’93-4 is the
smallest of the Govt, handbooks, tut is none-the-
less admiranly complete. Much of the present
issue (the eighth) is a repetition of the contents of
previous numbers ; but there is also some valuable
new matter, especially the article on Westralian
mines, by the Govt. Geologist; that on Westralian
vegetation, by Baron Von Mueller ; and that on
fisheries, by W. Saville-Kent. The compilation
and arrangement leave little to be desired; but
The Bulletin suggests, as an improvement to th*-
next issue, the incorporation of a short account of
the preceding year’s legislation and an abstract of
principal Acts, in the style of Pugh’s Q. Almanac.
The statistics, also, are generally very much
behindhand, being given, as a rule, only to Dec.
31, ’93. It would be better to defer publication
for a month or so, and bring the figures closer up
to date. - ■

Early Days on the Murchison.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The advent of the first barmaid at Cue
marks a local epoch greater than that which the
recent war with China signalises in Japan. She
walked up. Everyone walked up then, for the teams
only carried swags, fee. She had beautiful golden
hair and a sealskin jacket, and she wore them
both on blazing summer days. Her name was
Doxie; at least, she was known by that name only,
and she made havoc from the start. Then, some
one discovered that Duxie’s golden locks were not
her own, and stole the wig one night and threw
it on to the galvanised-iron roof of the pub.
There it was in the morning, visible to all Cue.
and poor Doxie had to go about in her natural
scanty locks until it was recovered. But she
survived the incident. She also survived life in
Cue for many mouths, and finally went away with
the goodwill of everybody and| something like
£5OO in her pocket.
*' • •
One Christmas Eve, in Doxie’s time, I wit-
nessed one of the strangest sights I ever saw. It
was full moon, and everybody turned out to enjoy
the night. The crowd consisted solely of men,
and only one man was drunk. But such men !
The pick of the world. Clad in flannels and
moles, the latter soil-stained deep red, the short
sleeves oj.bhe flannels showing their brawny arms,
burnt almost black by the sun ; there was scarcely
a man there under six feet Diggers who had
worked their way from North Queensland, through
The Territory and round by Kimberley, Roeburne,
and the Gascoyne. Young Englishmen of the
right stamp, who knew Eton, Cambridge, and
Oxford. Men from N.S. Wales, from Victoria,
and from the land of the crow-eaters. From all
places, in fact, they were there; and every man
carried a water-bag, and regarded it as jealously
as if it was a just-reobneiled sweetheart. Water
is plentiful enough now, but it was not so then.
These men were unwashed, and belonged to “ the
legion that never was ’listed,” but a finer, more
stalwart body of men could not have been found
on earth. There was one piano on the place, and
this was in the pub. near the Govt, well, and it was
kept going for hours that night. On the open
space around the well men lay and listened and
smoked and lovingly looked at their water-bags.
There was little conversation; it was quite suffi-
cient to lie in that glorious moonlight and listen
to familiar strains that brought back memories to
all, for- there were plenty of good amateur
musicians in the crowd.
• # •
Surveyor Cuthbertson’s party of new-
chums is an amusing remembrance. There were
eleven cf tJ.em, and every man had an outfit that
Stanley would not have despised. Their belts
were all pouches ; each man had a rifle, revolver
and shot gun. They all had three pairs of colored
spectacles, light blue, dark blue, and smoked.
They had green-dyed tents of a military style of
architecture. They had enormous canvas bags
bound round with thick leather straps, each
weighing at least eighty pounds. All these impedi-
menta were heaped high on a waggon, and they
had a light cart in addition. The man of the
party who had the most attenuated legs wore
knickerbobkers and “ puttis ” —the sort of thing
Major-General Hutton has introduced into the
N.S.W. “army.” Reused to ride about Cue in
this rig quite oblivious of the derision and scorn he
excited. Socially, they were not a success, and,
bub for the fact that there were plenty of good
men on the field from the same country, they
would have done some damage to the name of
Englishman. They did not stay long, their term
of exile being'twelve months only, during which
time they were supposed to make a fortune.
As, however, a good portion of this period was
spent between Perth and Geraldton, they had nob
much time to raise the pile in Cue. They went
’Ome disgusted with “the blasted colony.”

Formerly, Murchison payments were made
in gold to a great extent, and when the principal
store was shifted, some genius prospected the old
site and obtained about 3oz. fine gold. The un-
licensed store used to do a better grog-business
than the two licensed pubs., but somehow or other
the two publicans did not seem to resent this.
• • •
The singular thing about the Murchison of
those days was the fact that there was very little
drunkenness, and scarcely any crime—petty crime
especially. There was no thieving, no jumping
claims, no tricks of civilisation ; nothing but a
broad freemasonry. Things are, of course, diffe-
rent now. There are women there —and a news-
paper.

“The hideous duel of China and Japan is

Commend us to the man Sigel, hand
aboard the N.S.W. coasting steamer Vailele. It
was published broadcast throughout Australia
that Sigel had been murdered at Cootamundra,
bludgeoned to death, his body cut open and loaded
with stones, then sewn in a sack and plumped
into a reservoir, to be recovered by two boys fish-
ing—a drama of gore that piled notoriety on
notoriety’s head ! A reward was offered for the
discovery of Bigel’s assassin. Nob a chirp from
Sigel, alive and at work on the Vailele, during
many weeks ; and, when some humorless fool at
length pub a detective on the track, and when the
“ teck ” asks why ho didn’t come forward —“ My

right, and your worries didn’t bother me!” Be

Purves, Q.C., in his address to the jury-
on the Melbourne gun-fraud case, denounced the
defendants—the two Abrahams—as “men who
lived in an atmosphere of fraud, whose only god
was money, and out of whose eyes there
gleamed”—a finely-rbunded period, this—“the
greed of Oriental avarice.” At the same time
Purves was engaged to defend the same Abrahams
in another court on the very same accusation,
and to prove, in effect, that everything he was
then saying was a blank untruth, and that the
defendants had never lived in an atmosphere of
fraud in their lives. What a pity that the civil
and criminal cases couldn’t be consolidated, so
that the learned and shriekful lawyer could appear
on both sides at once 1 The spectacle of Purves,
for the prosecution, stating that the Abrahams
lived in an atmosphere of fraud, and then Purves,
for the defence, stating that they were honest and
upright traders; and Purves on the one side
demanding their condign punishment, and Purves
on the other side telling the jurymen that their
consciences would never be easy again unless the
accused were acquitted, would be not one whit
more ridiculous —to a layman.
In War Time.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The talk in the hut that night was about sheep-
dogs. It always is. Long-winded, pointless,
witless, interminable perjuries respecting sheep-
dogs, interrupted only by the monotonous “ fif-
teen-two,” &c., of a pair of crib-players.
At last a man who was reading in his bunk, and
who was always wasting his money on newspapers
and things, said : “ This Japanese war is getting
pretty hot —how will it go, Bo’s’n ?”
Bo’s’n was an old shepherd who had been a
man-o’-war’s man in his time.
“Don’t know, I’m sure. Things are so different
from when I was at sea. Seem to fight all right,
though.”
“ Those Chows appear to treat their men pretty
roughly.”
“ There’s others treated rough in war-time
besides Chows. I’ll tell you. I was bo’s’n’s-mate
of a ninety-four gun ship at the Crimea. One day
we hauled in as close as w e could get under some
Russian forts, and commenced to bang at them.
They pelts back at us, and when they got the
range their stuff began to come on board pretty
thick. After a while of this, word was passed
that some of our chaps were running below from
the guns. Rotten bad lot; some of them were not
long out of gaol and workhouse. The bo’s’n and
his mates—l was one —gets our cats, goes down,
and lambs them up on deck again. Some
we triced up and flogged properly. There was
over 30 men flogged on that ship while she was in
action. How’s that for rough ? I hurt a lob of
chaps in that fight, but I didn’t kill no more.
“ Another time I did kill a good few. In India
that was—time of the mutiny. We went for a
small sort of a town that had a wall all round it,
and was chock-full of niggers. Most of our chaps
got inside to hustle them up, and an officer took
about 20 of us round outside the wall and placed
us on sentry-go at the gates. I was pub at a
narrow sorb of gate-way by myself.
“ * Ain’t I to let no one out ? ’ says I to the
officer.
“ ‘lf the niggers will come out, just see that
they don’t get away,’ says he.
“Our chaps was firing, and there was an awful
row going on inside. I stood close to the gate-
way with my bayonet ready, and presently a chap
bolts out of the hole and spits himself fair on it.
I shoves him on one side, and two or three more
come and I got them, too. Two of our chaps was
at a gate 50 yards away. One of them was a mate
of mine and he sings out: —
“ ‘My bag agin yours, Sam, for a pound of
tobacco.’
“ ‘ Right,’ says I.
“ I must have stood at that door for over three
hours, until things were quietened down inside,
and never let one by me, and when we came to
count up my tally was 14, and the other two had
only 18 between them. So I won easy.
“I wish I had that tobacco again.”

The substance lost, yet clear and well-defined
The shade will ever last;
My heart-beats quicken as I call to mind
The pictures of the Past.
Around in Passion’s vortex we did whirl
Drunk with Love’s deep-drawn draught,
Recking no Power could sever man and girl
We gaily loved and laughed.
With arms entwined we failed to realise
The Future lay in Pawn ;
Forgot that o’er the bliss of night would rise
Inevitable Dawn;
Forgot that dread and dream-destroying Day
Its tribute would demand
And sweep our airy palaces away
Before its master hand.
The years have passed since first we flew in h i t ( .
To quench Love’s burning drouth,
But still I feel her arm-lock and can taste
Her kisses on my month.
To ponder o’er some vanished happy hour
A man may still elect,
For Brigand Fate possesses yet no power
To steal our retrospect.
So, still the sad, sweet mem’ry of that time
Will in my heart remain,
And nought alloys the thought of that sublime
And pleasurable pain ;
Though evermore her presence I’m denied
Who gave existence leaven,
Who drew the dull, grey veil of Life aside
And let me glance at Heaven,

Price, M.P. (S.A.), received numerous

Price seems to be the victim of National Ass

were libellous were made in the same speech as
that on which Gave and Go. unsuccessfully prose-
cuted the Labor M.P. for libel in February. Ash,
who prosecuted, did not pub Parsons in the box
to be cross-examined ; bub, all the same, the jury,
which consisted of propertied men this time,
mulcted Price in £lOO fine and costs. The Labor
members are much annoyed because Kingston
allowed his partner (Ash) to prosecute Price, the
general impression being that the latter is the
“mark” of political machinations against the
Labor-party.
