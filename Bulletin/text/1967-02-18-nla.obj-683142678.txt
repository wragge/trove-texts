The right moment
is everything...
. . . especially with wine, and especially with Orlando Blue
Ribbon "Spaetlese" Barossa Riesling. The right moment to
discover this superb, fruity white wine is to sip it, chilled,
with melon and ice cream, strawberries or any other sweet dish.
From the sweet crisp palate you will then appreciate why this
"late picking" white wine has been such a consistent Gold
Medal winner both in Australia and overseas.

Thinking about
new plant
expansion?
If so, you are probably thinking about the many complexities to be over-
come. The problems of design, of how to expand or modify an existing
plant or add process or plant capacity. Of how to effect these improve-
ments with the minimum interference to present plant output. The
problems are many and various, however on top of all of these factors
you're undoubtedly concerned about getting the best value for your
construction dollar.
This is where we can help you, because this is one of the fields in which
we specialise. Regarded as authorities in the field of technical plant
fabrication, we are equipped in terms of experience and facilities to save
you time and money in engineering and construction of your project.
Our present clients include a wide range of top industrial companies in

LETTERS
Catholic Schools
Sir,
Your reference in “Are Catholic
Schools Really Necessary?” (8., Feb.
4) to the 1879 Pastoral letter of the
Bishops to State schools as “seedplots
of future immorality, infidelity . . .”
does focus attention on an aspect of
State Aid that has received little atten-
tion. As a Catholic well educated at a
parish school and Christian Brothers
college I hope I have no axe to grind.
However, it is my conviction that it
was the gross accusations and intem-
perate language of our own bishops
that made the best-intentioned secularist
fear that we Romans were as bad as
they imagined, and led them to accept
a secularist education and to cease
financial help to denominational schools.
It was the R.C. Bishops Polding,
Geoghegan, and Vaughan with their
outstanding Benedictine and European
education that branded as secularists
the politicians, community leaders, and
the ordinary thinking and educated
people who were open to the influence
of serious journals and European ideas
as they began to come quickly through
the new international cable into the
local Press. Many of these Australians
accepted this “secularism” without
realising it, because it was reasonable,
and also as a reaction to the authorit-
arianism of Rome.
The bishops’ language against the
secularists and State schools was out-
rageous. State schools, thundered Arch-
bishop Vaughan, are “subversive not
only to religion and morality but also
to domestic peace and the rights of
people and of all social order.” And
I’m afraid the case put by our' bishops
ever since has not helped. Archbishop
Mannix in his very first address in
Australia in 1913 plunged headlong
into this subject, “the unequal treat-
ment meted out to you in the schools
is, as far as I can judge, the one
great stain upon the statute books of
this free and progressive land.” Dr.
Mannix was a brilliant churchman and
intellectual, but a poor politician, and
if he had given himself time to turn
his gifted mind to fully study the his-
tory of the National-Denominational
school development in this country he
may have done far more for this cause
of State Aid to Catholic schools.

1954 Venice Biennale
Sir,
The Australians who showed at the
1954 Venice Biennale were not the first
as Mr. Lynn claims (8., Jan. 14). Roi
de Maistre showed there in 1935. And
in 1952, as an Australian living in
Europe, I was invited to participate.
Canberra, then against modern art, in-
tervened and vetoed the entry. The
Biennale authorities made a plea, but
the Commonwealth Art Advisory
Board, who, it is safe to say, had never
heard of this ultra avant-garde Venice
show until my entry, immediately nomi-
nated Streeton for 1954. Eventually,
twelve more artists were nominated, but
some sense prevailed, and three were
selected to show with of course
Streeton!
In the future, it is desirable for
artists to prove in international shows
that Australia has a capacity for original
work; but the present art education
system where young artists and intend-
ing school teachers share the same
course may delay an effective partici-
pation.

Tariffs and Subsidies
Sir,
Your article “Farming Without Sub-
sidies” (8., Jan. 7) admits that Aus-
tralian rural industries are not ineffici-
ent and then proceeds to tell them
how to become efficient so that the
urban taxpayers will not have to pay
so much in subsidies.
I doubt whether such advice will
prove to be the solution to these prob-
lems. I think the solution lies elsewhere.
Professor Charles P. Kindleberger, of
Massachusetts, U.S.A., has likened a
tariff system to a system of multiple
exchange rates. In other words, the
Australian export industries are required
to compete on the official rate of
exchange whilst the protected indus-

is being used for payroll, staff records, costing and technical

tions to the computer system in plain language and an
Executive Master Programme takes over.

While this inequitable system pre-
vails, there seems every likelihood that
the Australian export industries will
need bigger and better subsidies with
more and more government control.

Doves into Hawks
Sir,
Mr. Griffin’s letter (8., Jan. 21)
reminds me of a conscientious objector
I came across in World War I. He
served as a non-combatant, but later
changed his conscience and finished up
a lieutenant-colonel, DSO.
A conscientious objector to me is
one who places his private views at
higher level than his public duty to a
community that has given him safety,
education, and some measure of afflu-
ence. I feel sorry for him. But let
there be no mistake, the Services don’t
want him. He is only a pest.
CHAS. NORTON

Buckley’s Poems
Sir,
In Rodney Hall’s review of Vincent
Buckley’s “Arcady and Other Places”
(8., Jan. 7), Mr. Hall claims to find
in these poems, or in their author, what
amounts to “an acceptance” (although
not a “complacent acceptance”) “of the
status quo. Indeed,” he goes on, “it
almost amounts to acceptance by de-
fault, depending on the absence of
social vices here that he sees in alterna-
tive societies.”
The point is doubtless a subtle one.
But granted that Buckley’s heart is
neither in Utopia nor in the Soviet
Union, but only in Australia, what
acceptance of any kind of the status
quo, or its vices, emerges from even
the most superficial reading of the
political poems?
No one could find in “No New
Thing” even the most debilitated
acceptance of “ . . . hard-faced men,
who beat the drum to call me to this
Cause or that.” And yet these men,
and others in the poem, are here, in
this society, with all their social vices
and with their indifference or hostility
to Buckley’s work (“The building of
the honeycomb”).
James McAuley, in an incomparably
more perceptive review of the same
volume writes: “The politicisation of
everything is the very enemy at which
the activist who fights for freedom must
strike.” One way of becoming a casualty
in that struggle would be to conflate,
as Mr. Hall has, Vincent Buckley’s
stroke at that and other enemies with
any kind of acceptance of the status
quo and its vices.

Face of the Week
The week began with 100-degree
temperatures and high fire danger in
parts of N.S.W., Victoria, Tasmania,
and South Australia. On Tuesday,
February 7, fires from the north of
Hobart were driven south by a gale-
force wind, and at least 51 people
were killed and up to 1000 homes
destroyed. Prime Minister Holt flew
to Hobart immediately on returning
from his New Zealand visit, and
G.-G. Lord Casey arrived at week-
end. Meanwhile the Northern Terri-
tory was having its best rain in 10
years, extending into northern
Queensland. In Canberra, E. G.
Whitlam was elected leader of the
Federal Parliamentary Labor Party,
with L. Barnard, of Launceston, as
his deputy. The ACTU applied to
the Commonwealth Arbitration
Commission for a $7.30 basic wage
increase. A move to stop the New
England referendum failed in a
Sydney court. State Premiers were
arriving in Canberra for the
Premiers’ Conference.
★ ★ ★
In N.S.W. a syndicate betting on
the place tote won $BB,OOO at a
trots meeting, depending on a Gov-
ernment guarantee. Next day the
rules were altered to prevent such
manoeuvres in future. In Mel-
bourne two hooded gunmen hijacked
an armored car and stole $62,000.
Yachtsman Sir Francis Chichester
had reached a point between Norfolk
Island and New Zealand on his
return voyage to England. Four
Australian soldiers were killed and
13 wounded when supporting fire
from the N.Z. artillery regiment fell
short. The Commonwealth accepted
a Papua-New Guinea House of
Assembly ordinance giving land-
holders the right to 5 percent of
royalties from mining on their land.

Grants for new teacher training
colleges in Queensland and Victoria
were announced, as were rises in fees
for technical education in Victoria
and N.S.W. Sydney University had
400 unfilled places for 1967 due to
an extra high school year in the
N.S.W. Wyndham Scheme. The
United Nations Development
Authority granted $1.3 million
toward the cost of Papua-New
Guinea’s first $4 million secondary
teachers’ training school. In Can-
berra the National Union of Aus-
tralian University Students
(NUAUS) said living allowances for
Commonwealth scholarship students
were quite inadequate. The Tas-
manian ferry terminal in Melbourne
was destroyed by fire, and a $lOO,OOO
Melbourne factory burned down. In
evidence before the Arbitration
Commission in Brisbane, an em-
ployers’ advocate coined a new term,
“mini-strikes,” three-minute visits to
the wash-basin.

FEBRUARY 18, 1967
A Matter of Heart
SOMETIMES it takes a tragedy
to draw neighbors together and
make them forget small differences.
This seems the only good thing one
could say after the bushfire disaster
in Tasmania. The response to relief
appeals was immediate and from
the nation; not from “mainlanders”
but from thousands of fellow Aus-
tralians. The Prime Minister, Mr.
Holt, spoke for all of us as he stood
among the smoking ruins and said,
“We are determined that the heart
should not be knocked out of Tas-
mania.”
It is important that this should
not happen within Tasmania, after
the first shock has faded a little
and “How and why?” become the
questions. Even before the end of
last week one voice was declaiming
about urgent questions the Gov-
ernment will be expected to answer
when it faces up to the heavy res-
ponsibility the fire disaster has
placed on it.
Self-examination must follow, as
it did throughout Australia after
the disastrous Victorian fires in
1939 and 1943, but calmly and
purposefully. Nothing can knock
the heart out of any community
so quickly as fierce recrimination,
citizen against neighbor.
For the people of Hobart who
have been used for so many years
to seeing smoke from bushfires
drifting over the summit of Mt.
Wellington and its spurs, the
sudden eruption of gale-driven fire
into their midst could not have
been more surprising had sem-
blance become reality and Welling-
ton an erupting volcano head.
Many of us in Australia live in
the shadow of the same volcano
every summer, when similar cal-
amities could occur anywhere with-
in the 50,000 or so square miles of
forested land, despite all of our pre-
parations. Experts tell us, “When
huge fires fanned by strong winds
develop, we are powerless to direct
or control them to any appreciable
extent, modern technology notwith-
standing.”
It is generally agreed among
experienced bushfire fighters that
the first 15 minutes is the crucial
time to hit a fire; a grass fire usu-
ally spreads five times faster than
a forest fire, doubling its speed on
only 10 degrees of slope even with-
out wind.
It is also agreed that the volun-
teer rural firefighting system is the
only one that works, and that
aerial water or chemical “bombing”
as a firefighting aid is limited and
costly. In Hobart last week, there
was too much growth, too much
wind, and too much heat.
If anything can be learned by
Tasmania it would be from Vic-
toria, where a network of well-
trained 1200 rural fire brigades are
in radio contact throughout sum-
mer. Where recent knowledge
might have helped prevent so many
deaths was in the “what to do”
area —• that heat radiation in ad-
vance of the fire leads to most
fatalities, not the flames.
But even this is preaching with-
out solace to friends and relatives
of the Hobart victims and to those
who have suffered the great prop-
erty loss. The main thing is to
convey the sorrow and sympathy of
their fellow Australians and neigh-
bors, and do everything possible to
ensure that the heart is not knocked
out of Tasmania.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Gough Whitlam’s Way
From ALAN REID in Canberra
Edward Gough Whitlam, 50, lawyer, six feet three inches tall, handsome, lucid,
and talented, last week achieved Labor office but not Labor power.
He now holds the title he has long
coveted of Labor Federal Leader. But,
paradoxically, his capacity to cope
with or replace the Left Wing
Victorian ALP controllers, whom he
himself has indicted before the ALP
Federal Executive and blamed as a
major contributor toward Labor’s
political erosion, has declined.
Previously, three of Labor’s four
E. G. Whitlam
mentary Executive would support such
a move. As I see the Executive posi-
tion it is:
Right Wing: Dr. Rex Patterson,
Qld., Mr. Tony Luchetti, N.S.W., and
Mr. Fred Daly, N.S.W. (with Daly
owing no gratitude to Whitlam).
Moderates: Whitlam himself. Barn-
ard, Mr. H. Webb, W.A. (who has
to take his instructions from the W.A.
ALP, which usually supports Victoria
in machine operations and is the power
base of Mr. F. E. Chamberlain, whom
Whitlam publicly describes as operating
a Chamberlain-Victorian axis), Mr.
C. Jones, N.S.W. (who was supported
by the Left Wing for his Executive
appointment), and Mr. Rex Connor,
N.S.W., who represents the strongly
industrial area of Cunningham, which
includes Wollongong.
Left Wing or Left-wing backed:
Senator Murphy, Senator Cohen, Dr.
Jim Cairns, Vic. (also a member of
the Victorian ALP Executive), Mr.
Noel Beaton, Vic., and Mr. Clyde
Cameron, S.A.
If Whitlam thinks he can get
majority support for any move against
Victoria from those groupings his
optimism clearly exceeds his prospects.
I think you could see Whitlam’s
recognition of his incapacity to do any-
thing frontally against Victoria emerge
at the first Press conference he held
after he became Federal Leader.
He soft-pedalled the situation in
Victoria. " It was no longer unique—
the hard core of Left-wing strength
in the ALP. “The position in Victoria
is only singular in that our vote is
light,” he said airily. “We can improve
our position in every State.” He would
not even admit that he had trouble at
ALP conferences—Victorian-nurtured
trouble—even though it is in the official
Labor records.
But he did give a glimpse of how
his mind could be working toward an
outflanking movement against Victoria
in place of the frontal attack that last
week’s events in the Caucus seem to
have precluded him from making, even
if he now desires it.
He talked—rather vaguely, admit-
tedly, but interestingly—about promot-
ing the ALP into a national organisation
which he gave the impression would
somehow reduce the powers of ALP
State machine controllers. It was almost
as though he were thinking that now he
is Federal Leader he can appeal over
the heads of these ALP machine con-
trollers to the ALP rank and file.
Personally, I think he is going to
parliamentary leaders were willing to
take action against the Victorian
ALP, and proved it by going to the
ALP Federal Executive only to have
the rug pulled from under their feet
by the then Opposition Leader, Mr.
Calwell. The three were Whitlam him-
self, then Deputy-Leader, Nick Mc-
Kenna, Senate Labor Leader, and Pat
Kennedy, then Deputy Senate Labor
Leader, all important figures within the
Labor Party.
Now Whitlam has only himself and
Tasmanian Lance Barnard, who, as
the new Labor Deputy, is untried and
inexperienced. As Senate leaders he
has Sydney QC Lionel Murphy and
Melbourne QC Sam Cohen, who is
actually a member of the Victorian
ALP Executive and has ' always
defended it stoutly. As both were
elected on Left-wing, mostly Victorian,
votes, the likelihood of them partici-
pating in any moves against the Vic-
torian Executive is rather remote.
In fact, I am told that at a victory
party on the night of the ballot, the
possibility of action against the Vic-
torian Executive was mentioned, and
scoffed at as no longer a possibility.
Not only that, but I don’t think, a
majority of the newly elected Parlia-
find this difficult. Victoria is all
machine. It has—relatively speaking—
no rank and file. On figures pub-
lished recently it would appear that
the Democratic Labor Party has
achieved the remarkable feat of
acquiring 12,000 members in Victoria
while ALP branch membership has
slumped to 9000.
Chamberlain is back in the saddle
in Western Australia. N.S.W. and one
Tasmanian delegate Barnard—are
really the only votes Whitlam could
really count on if he brought on a
showdown with Victoria in the ALP
Federal Executive.
And you can be certain that if they
entertain the slightest suspicion that
Whitlam is intending to appeal to con-
ference over the heads of the machine
controllers the Left-wing controllers
will have their delegations lined up at
the biennial ALP Federal Conference
to be held later this year.
Whitlam would undoubtedly like to
make changes in ALP organisation,
ALP machine personnel, and ALP
foreign policy—particularly foreign
policy. It was on his alleged misinter-
pretation of Vietnam policy that his
former leader, Mr. Calwell, took him
to task publicly on the eve of the last
Federal elections.
Whitlam wants these changes—prob-
ably must have them—if he is ever to
become Prime Minister of Australia.
But whatever his personal desires in
these fields, Whitlam holds only Labor
office not Labor power, and his ambi-
tion to reshape the Labor Party closer
to his ambition was not made any
easier by the persons with whom Caucus
last week surrounded him after he had
won the leadership.
The feature of the Caucus votes was
the narrowness of the margins. Whitlam
won by 39 votes to his combined
opponents total of 29, but thereafter
the votes went 35-33, 36-32, and 35-33
—and not all of them in his favor,
suggesting that Caucus is so slenderly
divided that he will either have to
abandon his aims or take considerable
risks to achieve them.
The test for Whitlam as a leader
will be which course he adopts, aban-
donment or risk-taking.
An interesting by-product of the
week’s voting is that for the first time
probably in 40 years there is no
Roman Catholic among the four top
leaders.
Bolte’s Prospects
Premier Sir Henry Bolte faces two
problems in the Victorian State elec-
tions to be held on April 29. The first
is the possibility of a hard fight to
retain his own seat; the other is the
chance that his Government could be
reduced to minority numbers in the
Upper House.
In the Legislative Assembly the
Liberal Party now holds 38 of the 66
seats. Even with the recent redistribu-
tion of boundaries and the addition of
seven more electorates to the Lower


House the Liberals are not likely to be
challenged by any substantial increase
in the Labor Party’s 18 and the
Country Party’s ten seats.
The biggest worry for the Premier
will be to defeat the new electoral
boundaries and a fresh line-up of con-
tenders for his own Western District
electorate of Hampden.
In the 1964 election he won about
57 percent of the total vote. The ALP
candidate gained 27 percent and the
DLP 15 percent. There was no Country
Party candidate cutting into the
Premier’s absolute majority of 2900
votes.
This time the Country Party is
nominating Mr. G. J. Anderson, a
soldier settler, who has the advantages
of being well regarded in the district
and of having a surname which will
put him first on the ballot paper and
capture the “donkey” vote. The ALP
and the DLP are also likely to present
fairly strong candidates.
There are strong forces at work in
the latter parties urging that supporters
give their preferences to Anderson. The
DLP is not confident that the hanging
issue will be an important one in the
campaign, but many of its leaders feel
very bitter about the Ryan case and it
is probable that this feeling will tip the
preferences.
The ALP faces the problem that its
last State conference carried a motion
declaring that preferences could be
given to the Country Party only on a
reciprocal basis. Some of its officials
are working hard to arrange such an
exchange.
The electoral changes are unfavor-
able to the Premier. He has lost the
subdivisions of Cobden and Beeac,
where his support was much stronger
than in the district generally; lost the
subdivision of Terang which gave him
only 50-50 support; and faces the addi-
tion of anti-Liberal Mortlake.
The effect of the hanging issue on
the election can only be guessed.
Country areas are probably more in
favor of hanging than those in the
city, but this likelihood may be bal-
anced by the fact that more Liberal
voters oppose capital punishment than
Labor voters.
The Liberal Party may be right in
claiming that views on hanging will not
be reflected in the April voting. On
the other hand, its apparent confidence
in the impregnability of the Premier’s
position in Hampden will not be justi-
fied if the other parties turn their
preferences against him.
April could see the return of farmer
Bolte to the lush pastures of the
Western District.

"What about the bloody workers?"
Road Toll: “The Effective Answer”
“One of the handsomest girls in a country district married the wealthy son of
an old and respected Australian family. Hope of happiness sat crowned at the
bridal. The young man, however, was fond of the glass, the craving became
stronger and stronger . . . confirmed drunkard . . . the big black skeleton had
chased happiness away . . . property became involved . . . returning home one
night, intoxicated . * . fell from his horse and was killed . the young wife
declared war against alcohol . . .”
These words are taken from “The
Drink Problem in Australia, or the
Plagues of Alcohol and the Remedies,”
a book published in 1893. They tell
an old and sad story, but not, alas,
one with any forseeable ending. In the
74 years between only the mode of
transport has changed.
How little things have changed was
a point made by Dr. J. G. Rankin at
the recent second Summer School of
Alcohol Studies held in Melbourne,
who quoted Lord Lonsdale’s reference
to the problems created by drunken
pedestrians in London over 200 years
ago:

metropolis, whoever shall pass along the

“What’s Brahms doing
on a dictating
machine?”
Most dictating machines don't reproduce
music too well because they have 1 speed
only, for words.
The National RQISBS has a l 7 i.p.s.
speed for dictation, plus a faster 3% speed
for finer musical effects.
And when headphones aren’t being used,
sound pours forth from a large 6" cabinet
speaker, not a tiny one in the mike. The
National plays longer, too. Its “auto-
reverse” gives 3 hours’ playing time, so it’s
ideal for meetings or long play classics
sessions at home. And when you’re dictat-
ing, you can switch to “auto-voice” to
capture your words and not your pauses.
So why lavish more on a 1-speed dictating
machine? $189.95 buys you a National 2-
speed, 9 transistor RQISBS tape recorder,
that does much more.

streets will find wretchedness stretched
upon the pavement . . . and only re-
moved by the charity of passengers
from the danger of being crushed by
the carriages . ...” Perhaps things have
changed a little . . .
The summer school was the second
conducted on alcohol studies by doc-
tors, research and social workers, and
others concerned with alcoholism. The
main sponsors were the University of
Melbourne Department of Medicine
and St. Vincent’s Hospital. It consisted
of scientific papers on alcoholism and
a symposium of eight papers on the
problems of alcohol and road safety.
The mounting toll of road deaths,
now almost four times as great as that
due to infectious disease, is significantly
linked to the consumption of liquor.
Dr. Rankin drew upon the findings of
overseas research which show that
abnormal errors in driving often
become detectable in persons who have
consumed two or three glasses of beer,
and that there is usually significant
impairment of driving skill, judgment,
sensory responses, and reaction times
after five glasses of beer.
He further claimed that “investiga-
tions show that the risk of accident in-
creases with a blood alcohol content
value of 0.05; there is a sharp rise in
the accident liability at or above 0.08,
when accidents tend to be more severe,
and more often involve only one
vehicle. At 0.10 the accident proba-
bility has increased six to seven times
compared with a blood alcohol con-
tent of zero, and at 0.15 (about 17
glasses of beer in a couple of hours)
the probability has increased more than
25 times.”
The police surgeon of the Victoria
Police Force, Dr. J. H. Birrell, disposed
of any arguments that alcohol is not a
major factor in road accidents by re-
porting the results of an investigation
undertaken by the California Traffic
Foundation in 1965.
The foundation analysed the cases of
more than 1800 dying within six hours
of a motor accident. It was found that
alcohol was involved with 55 percent
of the drivers and 45 percent of the
pedestrians. Drivers of vehicles clearly
responsible for their accidents more
often showed recent excessive alcohol
intake.
About 60 percent of drivers killed in
single vehicle accidents (running into
poles, etc.) had blood alcohol levels of
more than lOOmg. (About 12 glasses
of beer in a couple of hours.) The
drunken driver who survived longer
than six hours, but who may have killed
a non-drinking driver or pedestrian,
was not included in this investigation.
Dr. Birrell scorned the popular piece
of folklore: “It’s the young fellow with
a couple in who is the problem,” and
claimed that attempts to deal with
alcohol and road safety with slogans like
“If you drink don’t drive” were prac-
tically useless.
He urged that it was a mistake to
regard drinking drivers as a homog-
eneous group: “By comparing patterns
of drinking and other behaviour in
drunk drivers with the patterns of
groups of non-driving alcoholics and
non-drinking drivers, it can be shown
that alcoholism is often an established
problem by the time a drunk driver
is convicted. A number of observations
have led workers in both America and
Victoria to suspect that many drunk
drivers are chronic alcoholics.”
Dr. Birrell also put forward his
observations that:
• Three to four times as many drunk
drivers are admitted to alcoholism
rehabilitation programs as are people
admitted from the rest of the adult
male population.
• From one third to one half of the
drunk drivers arrested or involved in
accidents have prior convictions related
to the excessive use of alcohol.
• One recent study has shown that
drivers who may be classified as
alcoholics are responsible for 50 percent
to 75 percent of all accidents involving
alcohol, although they represent only
six percent of all drivers.
Dr. Birrell’s conclusions are that the
majority of drinking drivers are already
established alcoholics by the time they
are convicted or involved in an accident,
that present methods of dealing with
drinking drivers are futile, and that a
possible step in the right direction
would be to direct a drunk driver to
medical help after conviction.
More controversial but strongly
argued were the proposals of Dr. John
Santamaria of the Melbourne Uni-
versity Medicine faculty and the St.
Vincent’s Hospital alcoholism clinic. In
view of the importance of alcohol as
a factor in road accidents, he sug-
gested:
1. Blood alcohol estimations should
be made in all instances in which alco-
hol is considered to contribute to a
traffic accident or traffic offence. There
seems to be some merit in the method
employed in New York State where
application forms for driving licences
contain a necessary examination in such
cases. Refusal is still permitted, but in
that event the licensing authorities are
immediately notified and the licence is
revoked. A similiar situation prevails in
Canada under a law of implied con-
sent whereby a person accepting a
licence automatically agrees that he
should accept a test if reasonably re-
quired to do so by the police.
2. When a person suffers from cer-
tain clearly defined chronic medical
disorders, including alcoholism and
drug addiction, a driver’s licence
should be withheld or revoked until
medical certification is forthcoming
that indicates the condition to be satis-
factorily controlled.
3. A panel of medical men, expert
in the field of alcoholism, should be
established and any convicted driver
found to have a blood alcohol level
exceeding 150 mg. (about 17 beers in
two hours) percent should be required
to submit himself for examination by
one or more members of this panel.


The medical opinion then formed
should be admitted as evidence in
court. If the convicted driver is found
to be a “problem drinker,” the court
should be empowered to revoke the
licence to drive, renewing it only
subject to satisfactory medical evidence
that the patient has received treatment
for his condition and has shown an
adequate response to therapy.
Dr. Santamaria also proposed that
for the safety of the community it was
necessary to discover “problem drink-
ers” before they are involved in traffic
accidents or charged with driving
offences. “One avenue of discovering
these people is to make alcoholism a
notifiable disease.”
Dr. Santamaria’s paper was followed
by one concerned with cure, delivered
by Professor Day of the Monash Psy-
chology Department. Dr. Day argues
that since alcohol causes accidents (he
regards road accident rates as being of
epidemic proportions) and it is not
socially possible to abolish alcohol or
make drinking before driving a heavily
punishable offence, the hope of pro-
phylaxis lies in an education program.
He attacked present propaganda
methods of tackling the toll as being
of little value: “Although attitudes
might change temporarily, following
exposure to a film, there is no evidence
to suggest that the change is permanent.
It is more unlikely after exposure to
a hoarding or a newspaper advertise-
ment.”
Professor Day also pointed out that
propaganda which exhorts the person
to stop drinking is in competition with
stronger propaganda to the contrary.
“The individual’s behaviour is not
changed by ‘warnings’ and horror pic-
tures or catchy slogans. It would seem
that the only really effective answer is
to be found by educating the individual
in the school context as part of the
social education program.”
Drinking in a “driving” society is
unquestionably a major social problem.
Present methods of dealing with it
are only marginally successful, if at all.
Everybody believes that the slogan “If
you drink, don’t drive” is a fine piece
of advice, but few or no drinkers are
behaviourally influenced by it.
BRIAN BUCKLEY
Schoolrooms
THIS year for the first time the
frequently-referred-to sixth year
of high school becomes a reality
in N.S.W. and 11,500 young people,
who would normally be approaching
tertiary level education, are back at
school.
The unlucky ones are those in the
old-style high schools. Though conscien-
tious efforts have been made to alter
these to fit the new dimension in educa-
tion, the fact remains that they are
primarily schools full of classrooms in-
tended for a specific group of children
who would have stayed pretty much
together through five years.
The new system has exploded the
theories of classes as a unit and, in
fact, there is a psychological problem
to keep the forms together in some
kind of unity which will nurture a
good school spirit. Every 40 minutes
there is a mass exodus from class to
class, each single student going in his
own direction.
Producing a school to fit the new
education scheme has not been easy.
The Department of Public Works re-
quires two years’ notice to achieve a
high school, and the first experimental
schools were not translated from the
drawing boards until 1964. Depart-
ment of Education planners began with
a school which had “double-loaded”
corridors running down spinelike
through the building with two-storey
blocks of classrooms. This was to give
a free flow of movement, but it also
gave a free flow of sound.
Architect Michael Dysart was in the
forefront of the rethinking needed to
find an answer to the problem facing
the Department of Education after
accepting the Wyndham scheme. Dysart
first produced a standard within
which a number of schools could be
[individually planned and built in a
short time. The standard had to be
sufficiently flexible to fit diverse site
conditions, be economical, maintenance
free, and finally produce an architec-
turally cohesive group of buildings.
The corridor style resulted and of
these the high school at St. Ives was
the first and remained typical. Then
Dysart began working on the
idea of using courtyards to separate
“houses” which could contain students
of a certain year to produce
a feeling of unity. The courts would
be playground space for each year.
The first of these was completed at
Kuringai in 1965 a complete break
with tradition, but the idea of the
“houses” dissolved in the expediency
of having to use common areas for
science, cooking, sewing, and art.
In October, 1965, the Department
“Russian Embassy? Just a stone’s throw from here.”
instituted the School Building Research
and Development Unit. Here, in a
rather lively count-down atmosphere,
two architects, a quantity surveyor, and
a research assistant went to work with
an old hand at teaching, a Staff In-
spector, Mr. W. Jones. With the sure
knowledge that though schemes of
teaching may change children do not,
Mr. Jones and his team worked on a
succession of plans trying to find the
best arrangement possible.
In 1966 the first of these plans was
built at Pennant Hills. Michael Waller,
who had worked with Dysart, was the
designer. A most impressive pile of pre-
cast concrete, exposed aggregate, and
long low lines running over three levels,
the school is well placed in a natural
setting and cost $1 million. Courtyards
complete with podiums ideal for re-
citing Shakespeare, or presumably
calling the roll, are all part of the plan.
Movement is facilitated by covered
ways to the ground floor and galleries
running round the upper storeys.
The school is so far removed from
the old-style of high school that one
can begin to understand just what
enormous ripples have been cast by
Wyndham’s scheme. Seven laboratories,
two home -science kitchens, two busy
kitchens, woodwork and metalwork
rooms complete with lathes and weld-
ing plants, even a professional-looking
kiln, are all standard equipment.
This school has been repeated with
variations because of site differences and
at slightly less cost (approximately
$800,000) at Killarney, Colyton, and
shortly at Woolooware. Construction in
a similar vein is going on at seven
other sites in N.S.W. Foundations will
soon be laid for two more.
Meanwhile back at the drawing-
board with the addition of four more
architects to his team, Mr. Jones has
had to speed up the action and plans
are going forward for another type of
school—referred to as High School 5.

Face of the World
Asia: A four-day lunar New Year
truce in Vietnam and peace feelers
from Hanoi, with cessation of bomb-
ing as a pre-condition, aroused
peace hopes in world capitals. But
the U.S. wanted a similar reduction
of military action from North Viet-
nam, which was not offered. Mean-
while the Saigon Government had
called for a total of one million
Allied troops, to “end the war
quickly.” The confusion within
Communist China, if anything,
deepened with further conflicting
reports from the listening posts out-
side China. Soviet Embassy officials
in Peking remained beleaguered by
demonstrating crowds. Incidents of
mob violence occurred during India’s
elections campaign.
The Americas: A weather freeze
in north eastern U.S.A., with 20-
below temperatures in New York,
caused disruptions and killed 20
people, while 26 died in an Alabama
cafe fire. President Johnson asked
Congress for a legislation to control
firearms sales and reduce crime.
The Pentagon said America’s air-
craft losses in Vietnam had risen to
1120 fixed-wing aircraft and 630
helicopters in five years. Heavy-
weight boxing champion Cassius
Clay won an Bth title defence against
Terrell. In Nicaragua, General
Somoza was elected President.
Europe: The U.S.S.R.’s softened
approach to the West was continued
with Premier Kosygin’s visit to
London, where he offered exchanges
of technological information with
Britain and called for a detente in
Europe. There was news of another
exchange offer, Russian arms for
Iranian natural gas. Malta was pre-
paring to call British troops “in-
vaders.” Madrid police and students
clashed again. A Picasso painting
was sold by satellite TV hook-up,
proceeds of $105,000 to Florence’s
art restoration. The Beatles signed
a new nine-year recording contract.
The Warsaw Pact nations, upset by
Rumania’s recognition of West
Germany, met in Poland.
Africa: President Nyerere of Tan-
zania nationalised the banks, estab-
lished a corps of “Green Guards,”
and announced a march to “social-
ism and the classless society.” An
attempted coup was put down in
Sierra Leone. The Rhodesian Gov-
ernment set aside $1 million “to
combat sanctions.” South Africans
were angered when the U.S. carrier
“F. D. Roosevelt” put in to Cape
Town but stopped shore leave be-
cause the crew could not take part
in integrated activities. Rain stopped
play in the fourth cricket Test be-
tween Australia and South Africa.
OVERSEAS
East of Suez Up for Grabs
From JULIAN AMERY, MP, in London.
Can Britain afford to keep troops East of Suez? The debate on this question
still rages at Westminster and in Whitehall.
Let us consider it in the harsh
economic terms in which it has been
put. This year, Britain will spend
some $U.5.5.6 billion on defence. It is
no secret that this budget is not
enough to equip the armed forces
adequately to meet the commit-
ments the British Government has
accepted. To do the job properly,
Britain would have to spend about
$B4O million more a year. It was,
indeed, on this issue that Naval
Minister Christopher Mayhew and
First Sea Lord Admiral Sir David Luce
resigned.
But if, as Mayhew also pointed out,
Britain were to withdraw from all
commitments outside Europe, very
great savings could be made. Bases and
staging posts could be closed down.
The size of the forces could be cut by
at least a third. Their equipment and
structure could be greatly simplified.
Around $420 million of foreign
exchange could be saved each year. A
strategy limited to the defence of the
British Isles and to membership in
NATO should not cost more than $4.2
billion a year. It might well cost less.
The economic argument for with-
drawal is thus very attractive to a
country facing a tough economic
crisis and to a government reluctant to
make further cuts in consumption or
social reform. But let us look at it in
greater depth. Could Britain’s vital
interests be safeguarded simply by
maintaining a British deterrent force
and a contribution to NATO? In both
world wars, Britain was brought nearest
to defeat not by the German Army or
Air Fbrce but by the U-boats. The
British economy is wholly dependent
on the maintenance of communications
with the outside world. It is quite un-
like the largely self-contained economies
of the United States, the Soviet Union,
or even the main industrial countries of
Western Europe. There can be no
“Fortress Britain” in peace or in war.
Half of all Britain consumes food,
raw materials, manufactured goods
comes from overseas. Half of all Britain
makes is sold overseas. Besides this
visible trade, there is a vast invisible
trade: the proceeds of shipping, avia-
tion, banking, insurance, consultancies,
licences, agencies, and above all overseas
investments. In a few cases —e.g., South
Africa —the return on invisible trade is
even greater than on the visible. Taken
together, the receipts on visibles and
invisibles provide half the earnings of
the British people and it may be more
than half the Government’s revenue.
British living standards and British
social services are wholly dependent on
them. So is sterling.
The gold reserves of the Bank of
England are not much larger than the
reserves of a giant American corpor-
ation. But the real backing for sterling
is not gold. It is Britain’s overseas in-
vestments, whether in government or
private hands. The total value of these
investments is unknown. Many are not
quoted or could not find a ready mar-
ket. But the British overseas invest-
ment in quoted securities that could
be easily realised is at least $33.6 billion.
If by peaceful means Britain were
deprived of its overseas investments,
if it were denied access to world mar-
kets and raw materials, its economy
would collapse just as surely as if the
U-boats were at sea again. Some two-
thirds of Britain’s overseas investments
are “East of Suez.” So are some two-
thirds of its trade. East of Suez are
the countries that lie in an arc around
the Indian Ocean. They stretch from
Australia and New Zealand through
Malaysia, India, and Pakistan, across
to the Middle East, and then down the
East African coast to South Africa.
Australia is Britain’s most important
trading partner after the United States.
In two of the postwar years, Malaya’s
rubber and tin exports earned more
hard currency than did the exports of
the whole British industry. The British
investment in India and Pakistan is
immense. The Middle East is Britain’s
main supplier of oil. South Africa is
Britain’s third most important trading
partner. South African gold, diamonds,
and uranium make it the Fort Knox of
the sterling area.
Britain’s Basic Interest
How far are these interests threat-
ened? And by whom? The greatest
threat comes from Communism, which
does not tolerate foreign investment.
Britain’s investments in Russia, in
Eastern Europe, and in China were all
expropriated after their revolutions.
The same is true of trade. The Com-
munist countries are highly protec-
tionist, seeking to develop their own
resources rather than to exchange
goods and services with others. The
Communist revolutions in Russia,
Eastern Europe, and China have all led
to a contraction of Britain’s trade with
them.
It is, therefore, a basic British in-


terest to prevent countries where
Britain has important markets or
supplies of raw materials from going
Communist. Here Britain is even more
directly concerned than the United
States. The American economy could
be indifferent to the loss of Middle
Eastern oil or Malaysian rubber and
tin. The British economy could not.
This is why Britain has been a
founder member not just of NATO
but also of CENTO and SEATO. This
is why Britain fought in Korea. It
explains why, despite the fierce opposi-
tion of half his own supporters, Harold
Wilson s Labor Government gives sup-
port to U.S. policy in Vietnam.
Revolutionary nationalism guided
and supported by the Communists, such
as Nasser’s “Arab socialism” or
Sukarno’s “guided democracy,” can be
just as dangerous. In Egypt, Nasser has
nationalised the Suez Canal Company,
the Shell installations, and most other
Western business. In Iraq, the revolt.-
tionary government has not actually
nationalised the Tran Petroleum Com
nationalised the Iraq Petroleum Com-
pany. But it has unilaterally revoked a
larcre nart of its concession Further

expanding steadily.) In Indonesia, the
Sukarno regime expropriated not only
the properties of the former colonial
E and otter foreL intere* al
well. In all three countries, moreover,
the combination of socialist policies and
heavy rearmament programs has pro-
duced grave financial crises. These have
strangled the flourishing trade that
Britain once enjoyed with them.
Until recently American policy-
makers tended to support Nasser and
Sukarno. They hoped in this way both
to keep Egypt and Indonesia out of
the Communist sphere and to supplant
Britain’s economic position in the
Middle East and South-East Asia. There
is nothing new in such rivalry. But as
a policy it has not paid off. British
interests have been injured by it but
American interests have not gained.
The United States indeed has received
far more kicks than rewards for its
political and economic support of the
Egyptian and Indonesian dictators.
The Communist powers have had
good reason to support Nasser and
Sukarno. They know that the devel-
opment of nuclear weapons rules out
major war as an instrument of Com-
munist policy. They plan, instead, to
defeat the West by cutting off first
Europe and then the United States
from their markets and raw materials.
For this purpose Nasser and Sukarno
have proved useful instruments.

“
Sukarno backed at home
by the LonesTan ’ CommunUts and
abroad by the Soviet Union, embarked
upon his confrontation of Malaysia.
Though aimed in the first place at the
Borneo territories, this was a thinly
disguised attempt to overthrow the
Malaysian regime and incorporate
Malaysia into Indonesia. Had Suk-
arno’s aggression succeeded, Britain’s
interests in Malaysia and Singapore
would have been expropriated as surely
as they were in Indonesia itself. In the
longer run, besides, an enlarged near-
Communist Indonesia with a popula-
tion of more than 100 million would
have presented a grave threat to
Australia.
p o h C y Q f confrontation would
have succeeded but for the presence of
British forces based on Singapore and
Malaya and fighting in Borneo,
Sukarno’s failure encouraged the mili-
tary leaders to organise a counter-
revolution against him and his Com-
mumst associates. The Indonesian
Communist Party, the largest outside
Russia and China, has been virtuallv
exterminated. Sukarno is a prisoner
J n his palace. Confrontation has been
abandoned. The immediate threat to
British interests has been defeated. In

East Asia has the resources and the
skil ls to become an area of stability
and prosperity. Bn, the process will
take time - Meanwhile, Britain will be
wise to maintain a continuing military
presence. The costs involved are small
compared to the interests at stake,
It is already clear that, despite the
resolutions at the Labor Party con-
ference, this is also the view of Wilson’s
government. This makes it all the


harder to understand why he should
adopt precisely the opposite course in
the Middle East.
The beginning of this year saw the
forces of revolution in the Middle East
in full retreat. In Syria economic dis-
tress was matched by political in-
stability. In Iraq the greater part of
the army and the air force was tied
down in a hopeless war in Kurdistan.
Thanks to the Kurds, Kuwait and the
Saudi oilfields were safe from Iraqi
attack.
In the Yemen, an Egyptian army of
sixty thousand had met defeat and
abandoned half the country to the
royalists. In August, 1965, Nasser
himself was forced to go cap in hand
to King Faisal at Jiddah and promise
publicly to withdraw his troops. Inside
Egypt, Nasser’s regime faced growing
economic difficulties and discontent.
American support seemed in doubt; the
Soviets were cool. People questioned
whether Nasser would last out the year.
Meanwhile the influence of King
Faisal and the Shah of Iran was grow-
ing daily. Their Islamic Alliance,
embracing Arab and non-Arab Mos-
lems, offered a broader basis than
“Arab socialism” for Middle Eastern
stability. The initiative had passed into
the hands of the oil-bearing countries,
the only ones with the resources to
contribute to the reconstruction of the
area.
At the back of the oil-bearing coun-
tries stood the military power of Britain.
Iran is linked to Britain in the CENTO
alliance. The oil sheikdoms of the
Persian Gulf all have defence agree-
ments with Britain. Since the Egyptian
invasion of the Yemen, British relations
with Saudi Arabia have become cordial
and close.
The fulcrum of British power in
the Arabian Peninsula is Aden, the
third busiest harbor in the world. It has
a magnificent airfield, good workshops,
an oil refinery, and excellent accom-
modation for troops. It was from the
Aden base that Britain prevented the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1961. It
was from Aden that Britain suppressed
the mutinies in Kenya, Tanzania, and
Uganda in 1964. Aden is still a British
colony. But it is also a member of
the South Arabian Federation. This is
an emerging state, still under British
protection, and embracing the moun-
tainous sheikdoms and emirates that
constitute the hinterland of Aden.
For some years it has been British
policy to make the South Arabian
Federation, including Aden, an inde-
pendent nation. In 1964, the Conser-
vative Government proposed that inde-
pendence should come by 1968. The
South Arabian Government welcomed
this offer, but in view of the presence
of Egyptian forces in the neighboring
Yemen, they made it a condition of
their acceptance that Britain would
keep military forces in South Arabia to
defend them against external aggres-
sion, This was agreed by the Conser-
vative Government in an exchange of
letters. The subsequent Labor Govern-
ment gave verbal assurances that it
would honor the Conservative Govern-
ment’s undertaking.
Then suddenly in February, the
Labor Government announced that it
would quit Aden altogether in 1968.
It also revoked the undertaking to de-
fend South Arabia after it became
independent. The immediate effect of
the announcement was to sabotage the
Jiddah agreement. The very same day,
Nasser declared that his army would
now stay in the Yemen until Britain
had left Aden.
Britain’s decision gave Nasser a new
lease of life. Once the British, had gone,
the Egyptian army in the Yemen
would be the dominant force in south-
ern Arabia. There would be nothing to
stop it marching into Aden at the in-
vitation of Nasser’s friends there. From
Aden and Mukalla, Nasser could move
along the coast into Muscat and Abu
Dhabi and seize their growing oilfjelds.
There would be little to stop him.
British troops based on Bahrain might
defend Kuwait for a time against
attack. But they could do little against
subversion and would themselves be
increasingly a target for terrorism.
United States influence might prevent
a direct attack on Saudi Arabia. But
the pressures making for subversion of
the royal regime would be bound to
grow.
Nasser’s actions, since the British
Government’s announcement in Feb-
ruary, have already made his intentions
plain. For some time the Egyptians
have been training terrorists in the
Yemen and sending them across the
border to attack the British. This
campaign has now been greatly intensi-
fied to create the impression in Arab
minds that the British are being driven
out by the Egyptians. But in addition
to attacking the British, the Egyptians
are stepping up terrorism against the
South Arabian Federation Government
and its officials. Nasser is out to weaken
them and prevent them from offering
serious resistance to him when Britain
goes.
Egyptian policy inside the Yemen
has also hardened. After the Jiddah
agreement with Saudi Arabia, Nasser
tried to conciliate the more moderate
Yemenis. Obvious pro-Egyptian stooges
like Abdullah Sallal were withdrawn
to Cairo and members of the so-called
“third force” were brought into the
government. Now all that has changed.
Sallal and his friends are back in
power. The moderates have been
proscribed. Fifteen of them, indeed,
have been arrested and executed after
a drum-head court martial.
The prospect of an Egyptian occu-
pation of Aden revived Soviet interest
in Nasser. When Premier Kosygin
visited Cairo he urged Nasser to adopt
more “socialist” policies at home. He
also pressed him to mend his fences
with Syria and so rebuild the revolu-
tionary front in the Middle East. Since
then Soviet and Egyptian diplomacy in
Iraq has been working for a settlement
between Bagdad and the Kurds. Its
objective is to free the Iraqi Army and
Air Force to threaten Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia from the north, while Nasser
moves against them from the south.

COMMUNIST AID
TO THE UAR
The Soviet Union has provided
Nasser with more than SU.S.2 bil-
lion in aid since 1954, more than
half of it military. The billion-plus
in weapons includes MIG jet
fighters, light and medium jet
bombers, self-propelled artillery
and tanks, submarines, destroyers,
and surface-to-air missiles.
Economic aid extended by all
Communist countries from 1954
through 1965 totalled $1,664,000,000,
of which the Soviet Union contri-
buted $1,011,000,000. Of this, $325
million went toward construction of
the Aswan Dam. In recent years,
economic aid has been directed to-
ward industrial projects of the
UAR’s Seven-Year Plan, including
$225 million in credits advanced in
1965.
Soviet aid is on a strict barter
basis, with the UAR making regular
short-term payments in commodities,
principally cotton. The books are
carefully kept, and when a poor crop
causes the payments to fall behind,
they are usually carried over to the
next year.
UNITED STATES AID
TO THE UAR
From 1953, the year after the!
revolution that in 1954 brought!
Nasser to power, to June 30, 1966,!
U.S. aid to Egypt (later the United!
Arab Republic) totalled $U.5.1,136,-
900,000. The major categories are as
follows:
Aid loans . . $105.4 million
Grants 68.1 million
Export-Import Bank
long-term loans .... 40.5 million
Food for Peace .. .. 904.9 million
Food for Peace shipments, mostly
wheat, were paid for largely in local
currency that remained in the
country to finance development pro-
jects approved by the United States.
This aid ranged from an initial allot-
ment of $23.5 million in 1954 to a
high of $177.4 million in 1962. Some
$55 million was authorised for the
first half of 1566. No new agreement
has been made.
The U.S. food shipments have
allowed the Egyptian Government to
release rice for export to Communist
countries, including Cuba. With the
food problem eased, the country has
been able to barter more of its cot-
ton for arms.

Soviet Premier Kosygin, recently in London, was visiting President Nasser last
year, also to “cement relations.”
was Admiral Sergei G. Gorshkov, with
a strong naval staff. This has given
rise to talk of a Soviet base in Alex-
andria. But the real Soviet design is
probably more ambitious. If Nasser
were to occupy Aden he would control
both ends of the Red Sea. His further
advance toward the Persian Gulf, more-
over, would have to be largely by sea.
Egypt alone could scarcely pursue a
naval grand strategy on this scale. But
it could do so with Soviet naval sup-
port. The Soviets’ design may well be
to establish themselves both in Egypt
and at Aden the point that Britain
.made the key to the Persian Gulf and
to East Africa.
Hitherto, black Africa has remained
beyond the Soviets’ reach. During the
Congo troubles they tried for a time
to supply the Gizenga regime at
Stanleyville. But even with bases in
Upper Egypt, the logistical difficulties
of the operation proved insuperable.
It had to be abandoned. Since then
the Soviets have been arming the
Somalis and building up their influ-
ence in the Horn of Africa. But they
still lack an effective base from which
to play at the African table. A base
at Aden, with secure sea and air com-
munications to Egypt, would exactly
meet their need.
Until Britain leaves Aden, this
Soviet design is a pipe dream. But if
the British go, who will prevent it
from becoming a reality? There is no
American base in the area apart from
the rather sketchy facilities still main-
tained at Dhahran. Britain and the
United States, it is true, plan to set
up jointly controlled staging posts in
some of the remoter islands of the
southern Indian Ocean. ' But work
there is still at an early stage. Nor
could these islands ever become bases
in the sense of Aden or Singapore. It
would be more accurate to think of
them as fixed aircraft carriers. They
could give useful air support to an
operation on the Asian or African
mainland. But they would scarcely
deter Egyptian subversion backed by
a visible Soviet presence in Aden. I
pioneered the so-called “island strategy”
when Secretary of State for Air. But
we thought of it then as a supplement
to Aden and Singapore, never as a
substitute for them.
A possible solution would be for
the United States to join Britain in
maintaining the Aden base. U.S. oil
interests in the Persian Gulf are in as
much peril as those of Britain. But the
U.S. involvement in Vietnam is such
that there seems little prospect of
bringing the American public to
accept a new military commitment.
The choice before the British Gov-
ernment, then, is clear. If it withdraws
from Aden, it will create a vacuum;
and Nasser and the Soviets will fill it.
British investments and trade in the
Gulf will then go the same way they
have gone in Egypt and Indonesia. For
the first time, too, British interests in
eastern and southern Africa will be
directly exposed to Soviet pressures.
The alternative course is to reverse the
present decision and maintain a British
presence in Aden at least until Nasser
honors the Jiddah agreement and
withdraws from the Yemen. The de-
cision to quit Aden was taken on
grounds of cost. But the cost of stay-
ing would be negligible at most $4O
to $55 million a year.
If the British Government now de-
cides to stay in Aden, there is every
chance that Nasser’s confrontation of
Faisal and the Shah in the Persian
Gulf will collapse as Sukarno’s, con-
frontation of Malaysia has done. This
would open the prospect of a period
of stability and economic expansion
in the Middle East.
The experience of South-East Asia
and- the prospect in the Middle East
point to the conclusion that Britain
cannot afford to withdraw from East
of Suez. The cost of going would be
far greater than the cost of staying.
But how long will Britain have to
carry the burden? No one can say for
certain. Yet there are grounds for
cautious optimism. The wave of anti-
colonialism is largely spent. Revolu-
tionary nationalism is on the wane.
South-East Asian and Middle Eastern
statesmen are much readier than they
were to advocate co-operation with
the West. If stability returns to these
areas, the military burden will diminish
correspondingly.
Meanwhile there is no choice for
Britain but to soldier on. The defence
of its economic interests requires it.
So, too, does the discharge of its res-
ponsibilities to the rest of the free
world.


ONE MORE
WEEK
The Cocktail Hour
THE YEAR is still young, but we are
prepared to nominate the following
from the “Financial Review” as one
of the significant statements of 1967:
“The current Tariff Board inquiry
into gherkins has raised vital issues for
Australia’s future trading policy with
Communist-bloc countries.”
Translation
ONE INTERESTING FACT and
perhaps it was the only cheering one
which came out of a recent survey
on venereal diseases in Western Aus-
tralia was that the old euphemisms,
such as “promiscuous behaviour,” which
still cloak sex like frills around Vic-
torian table-legs, are completely mean-
ingless to many young people. They
had to be translated into “sleeping
around” or “shacking up” before the
survey could proceed.
Life among the Fossils
THERE IS nothing dead or dull
about the latest addition to Sydney’s
Australian Museum, the Hall of Fossils,
which was opened to the public in
November, 1966. During the school
holidays more than 350,000 visitors
have gazed at the giant plastic sloth as
they made their way through the hall.
The exhibition, which took some
years to prepare, has been arranged so
that the visitor automatically moved
from the Archaeozoic period, 4600 mil-
lion years ago, to Pleistocene times, a
mere million away. Each new exhibit
is planned to catch the eye, leading the
student in the right direction. This
is psychologically very far from the
usual flat cases ranged against a wall.
Well lit and staged, the gallery brings
the countless years wrigglingly and
savagely alive again and provides
graphic information both for those who
know nothing and for those whose field
this is. In fact, Mr. H. O. Fletcher,
Deputy Director of the Museum and
Curator of Fossils, whose dream has
materialised in the new hall, often finds
himself browsing among the exhibits.
“It is a good gallery,” he said. “And
only shows what can be done with a
little money. The cases alone here cost
$34,000. All the planning was done by
Mr. Brian Bertram from the Art and
Design Section. Our staff made all the
models and worked out the dioramas.”
Mr. Fletcher’s favorite fossil is an
insect’s wing dating from the Triassic
period, 220 million years ago (give or
take 40 million), which was found at
the Beacon Hill Quarry near Brookvale.
It is perfectly preserved, even the sound
box against which the insect rubbed its
legs is clearly shown. “Unfortunately,”
Mr. Fletcher said, “we only gained a
percentage of the wonderful fossils that
emerged from Brookvale. We tried to
interest the workmen, but for the most
part they wouldn’t try too hard if it
meant splitting the rock.”
Sad to say there are probably many
rare Triassic period fossils in founda-
tions and terraces built from Brookvale
stone. It is also rather depressing to
learn that the museum has only a cast
of the rare amphibian paracyclotosaurus
davidi watson, the only known skeleton
of stereospondylous labyrinthodent in
the world, which was found in St.
Peter’s quarry near Sydney in 1910.
Despite the claims of the local museum,
which was founded in 1827 and has
been housed at the present site since
1852, this treasure was allowed to be
sold to the British Museum. Mr.
Fletcher does not feel that this would
happen today. “There is so much more
interest in science, generally, and cer-
tainly in the natural sciences.”
The Australian Museum, which has
a staff of 70, including 11 curators,
houses the national collection of fossils,
minerals, and anthropological speci-
mens which are available to scientists
engaged in research, though not, of
course, to the general public.
There is great anxiety at the present
time among the curators because lack
of space for spirit specimens has almost
reached a critical state. Plans and work-
ing drawings for six new floors have
been drawn up and money was almost
found for the work last year, but finally
it had to be shelved. The museum is
under the broad wing of the N.S.W.
Department of Education.
However, work goes on despite fin-
ancial disappointments. Modernising the
galleries is a perpetual task and the
next gallery to follow the successful
Hall of Fossils will be an Anthropolo-
gical Hall, which should be completed
by the end of the year. Both halls are
in the new (1963) wing, which in itself
was quite an achievement, melding
seven storeys to the century-oid College
Street building in an osmosis of periods
which is not as awful as it might have
been. At least it showed a constructive
instead of destructive approach rare in
Sydney. Besides, architectural periods
seem pretty transient when balanced
against 4000 million years.
Journey Into Darkness
AUSTRALIAN film-maker Cecil
Holmes, who is currently with “The
Territorian” in Darwin, writes that the
locals were sardonically amused when
the “Journey Out Of Darkness” film
unit arrived in the middle of the mon-
soon rains.
Yet, Holmes admits, Jim Trainor,
who is directing the film for Australia-
America Pictures, confronted the prob-
lems of disrupted airline schedules, a
flooded Stuart Highway, and ships
which were no longer being unloaded
with equanimity, a low budget not-
withstanding. However, most of the
film is being shot in the Centre.
The synopsis of the story, Holmes
felt, read like the *sort of melodrama
Charlie Chauvel would have done back
in the ’thirties. Tribal killing, black
tracker plus policeman in search of
the committer of the dastardly deed,
capture, hostile natives encountered,
disintegration of white man, killer
comes good, etc., etc. The story is alsa
liberally littered with historical and
anthropological errors.
These matters v being raised, Jim
Trainor defends the proposition well, if
somewhat testily! “This is an artistic
impression, not a documentary. Ever
since I was a youngster I have been
fascinated with stories about a white
man and an Aborigine being flung to-
gether in this fashion. It’s the con-
flict of codes that is important. Really,
the theme is universal, common to every
region of the world. I have placed it
at the turn of the century so we can
avoid the problems of transceivers and
helicopters. But I hate spelling things
out. I’m concerned with nuances. You
can’t write all this down in a page-and-
a-half synopsis. I wouldn’t even try.”
And the use of Aborigines? There
has been some criticism already about
their virtual non-employment in a film
which, after all, dealt in their customs,
tradition, and history. “I don’t believe
there is an Aborigine able to play the
part or parts involved in this film,”
Trainor said. “It’s too difficult. I know
there has been a reaction and I’m hon-
estly astonished. This is a kind of in-

verted racialism. What is wrong with
a white man playing an Aborigine?
Or vice versa? It’s the end result that
matters.”
Ed Devereaux, who makes up as the
Aboriginal tracker, is, of course, an
actor with a strongly established reputa-
tion. He disposed of his last experience,
“They’re a Weird Mob,” quickly. “It
gave people a sense of identification,
if nothing else. It was both wonderful
and pathetic to see Australians getting
such a kick out of seeing themselves, or
as they imagined themselves, anyway,
up there on the big sheet. The weakest
joke, the most everyday swear-word
produced gales of laughter. It’s so sad
really.”
And how about simulating an
Aborigine?
“I know, I know, I’ll get every sling
and arrow the pundits can lay their
hands to. All I can say is that I took
this on with an attitude of humility.
I want to invest the character with dig-
nity. I think I can comprehend the
dilemma, the between-two-worlds thing.
I did know an Arunta tribesman when
I played in “Desire of the Moth,” with
Googie Withers. This was a bloke called
Stephen Dodd. He’d been a stockman
up in the Centre and we became good
mates. I learned a lot from him.”
And how do you transform as you
put that make-up on, move across from
a European-Australian to 'an Abori-
gine? Ed Devereaux thought for a
moment, quite carefully, then said, “I’ll
tell you something. The other day in
Alice Springs we had finished shoot-
ing and I was lugging some gear into
the back of a truck. We are only a
small unit so it’s all hands to, you
know. I was struggling with this hefty
bit of equipment, just by myself, there
in the streets of Alice Springs. Two
blokes came by white fellows and
if they could have they would have
walked right over me. I didn’t exist.
I was a non-person. Certainly, they
never gave me a hand. You see, I
hadn’t taken my make-up off. I was
a blackfella. An Aborigine. In that
moment I knew what it was like to be
a black man in this country. Maybe
I’m a bit over-sensitive, but the hairs
stood up on my neck in fear and
horror.
“Later I went to Darwin, wan-
dered around a bit, tried to test
reactions. I’d got curious about this.
And it was the same as Alice Springs.
I didn’t exist. I may as well have been
a lamppost, a stone on the ground.
Something you just walk around or
kick aside. I was a non-person. I
might not know what it is like to be
an Aborigine, but I’m sure beginning
to find out.”
Unwittingly perhaps Ed Devereaux
may have stumbled upon a film idea
that had more meaning and relevance
than the task he had been hired to
perform. He had been making a
journey, not out of darkness, but into
it.
Day in the Suburbs


Diary of an Actor
Adapt or Perish is Vital in the Theatre
SINCE coming back to Australia two
years ago I have given a lot of
interviews. Most of them have
left me dissatisfied, not because of any
shortcomings in the interviewer but
because, as a performing artist, I am
painfully aware of how much may be
gained by thorough rehearsal. I am
not so disingenuous as to present the
following interview as “utterly frank”;
much of it is distilled from interviews
already given.
Question: Do you intend staying in
Australia?
Answer: Yes, so long as the going’s
good.
Q.: Has it been that rewarding for
you since you came back?
A.: The most rewarding period I’ve
known—both artistically and financially.
Q.: And yet this has been at a time
when there are no indications of a
general boom in the theatrical profes-
sion. What special factors have applied
in your case?
A.: Without a doubt the one-man
show has been the most important one.
Then the diversification of my abilities
and the fact that I have worked over
the national field and not confined
myself to a single city.
Q.: You think you have a national
reputation now?
A.: That’s what the record shows.
Q.: Do you like doing one-man
shows?
A: Physically I find them a bit too
•wearing. I doubt whether I would
have come to the one-man show except
as a desperate means of escaping from
the “chance” factors that usually govern
the course of an actor’s career.
Q.: What was your first one-man
show, and how did it come about?
A.: “The Diary of a Madman” in
Ireland. I had finished a season with
the Bristol Old Vic playing a very
good part in “War and Peace.” I had
some extremely good notices for this
performance when -we came to play it
at the London Old Vic and at the
Phoenix. The time seemed ripe for
a big “break” into London, I thought.
I decided not to return to Bristol but
to give it a go in London. The result
was that I was out of work for a few
months. I had a renewal of the offer
to return to Bristol with the prospect
of an American tour, but I declined this.
I knew that if I went back there I
would be bound to be cast in roles
which I thought gave me insufficient
scope. I was thirty-nine. I felt I
couldn’t afford to wait much longer for
my critical run. So I decided on the
one-man show as a means of bypassing
the tyrannies of good luck and circum-
stance.
Q.: Weren’t you worried about stick-
ing out your neck too far? Had there
been other one-man shows that influ-
enced you?
A.: Yes, I was fortified by the
example of Micheal MacLiammoir
and Sir John Gielgud. It was said
that both of them were on the slippery
slopes some years before and had
pulled themselves out with their one-
man shows. It’s true that to take a
course like that requires a great faith
in one’s own ability. But despite occa-
sional ebbs in my self-confidence I
have had a high estimation of my own
ability for some time. Probably since
I tackled those Everests of Drama
King Lear and Hamlet and found that
I didn’t have to turn back. I knew,
too, that most of my best performances
had been given in parts that I had
elected to play usually in my own
productions. If I had accepted other
producers’ estimates of the sort of role
I was suited for I would never find
my scope. Producers had tended to
cast me as a big, even bluff type,
mature, authoritative. Yet, at heart, I
am not attracted to any character who
is too sure of himself.
Q.: That doesn’t quite tally with
what you said a moment ago.
A.: Confidence in one’s ability
doesn’t necessarily imply that one is
a confident person. I don’t suppose I
am a particularly unconfident person,
but I’m fairly conscious of my failings.
It’s the fatal flaw in a man that finally
sparks off some sympathetic combus-
tion in me. I remember when I played
Higgins in “Pygmalion,” some people
thought I was a “natural” for the
part. I couldn’t find myself at all. The
character was too invulnerable.
Q.: So the one-man show was a
desperate measure. And a gamble, too?
A.: Yes, when I came back to Aus-
tralia two years ago I knew I had
to arrive with some sort of a bang
since I had left Melbourne with a
whimper four years earlier.
Q.: Debts, you mean?
A.: I had to make some big money
quickly if I was to get on top of
those theatrical debts I had left behind
me. And I did.
Q.: It is often said that an actor
ought not to produce himself in a
play. Is there anything to this?
A.: Sometimes. But it goes right
against my experience. Perhaps it is
hard for the other actors to look an
actor in the eye with the uneasy
knowledge that the actor-producer is
reserving some of his perceptions for
critical scrutiny. I would claim that I
am very different from most actor-
managers in that I am always more
interested in the production as a
whole than in my own particular act-
ing contribution.
To that extent I am self-effacing.
But this is more a matter of strategy
and judgment than modesty.
Q.: Do you prefer acting to produc-
ing?
A.: Yes.
Q.: Do you imply that you have
gained something as an actor from
your activities as a producer?
A.: Yes. I can appreciate where act-
ing leaves off and that sometimes the
most effective thing is to put oneself
in the shade and take a rest.
Q.: Do you follow “The Method”?
A.: No. But Stanislavski has been the
greatest single influence. But I don’t

purposes to paper. Stanislavski's idea
about “the line of the will” seems to
me fundamental to all drama.
Q.: What is his idea exactly?
A.: He takes this word “acting”
quite literally. The actor is not on the
stage to express feelings but to repre-
sent the projection of the human will
into a situation with the idea, of course,
of altering that situation to his own
ends. You might be surprised to find
what wonders can be worked with a
young actor’s performance if you tell
him to stop worrying too much about
what the character is feeling and con-
centrate on what he is trying to do
and how he is going to go about it.
In other words, when you tell him to
start acting. Many of Lee Strasberg’s
followers have not merely debased this
idea, they have inverted it into an
exaltation of “feeling” at the expense
of consciousness.
Q.: Sounds to me as though a strict
follower of Stanislavski might bore the
audience to death. Do you follow the
theory all the way?
A.: No, it’s just that, when things
seem to go off the rails, I refer back
to it. I approach acting in the way
that most artists approach their art,
in the measured and sympathetic and
sometimes cool way that a musician
might consider a sonata or a dancer
the choreographic design.
Q.: Do you like to be thought of as
an actor?
A.: In some ways I admit I don’t.
At times I’m conscious of squirming
at the description. For instance, when
I read in the paper: “Actor Peter
O’Shaughnessy.”
... I was very struck by one of
“George Dillon’s” speeches in John
Osborne’s play. There he was crouch-
ing in a trench with the shells raining
down and his companion asked him
what did he do in civvie life and he
had to reply, with a feeling of ludi-
crous insufficiency: “I am an actor.”
Q.: Wouldn’t the reply: “I am a
musician” or “I’m a painter” have
seemed equally inadequate?
A.: No, I don’t think so. I admit
that I would have preferred to be
known as: “Painter Peter O’S.” or
“Musician Peter O’S.” In fact, there
were times when I was more interested
in those art forms than in the theatre.
I also like the story told by an actor
in a Chekhov play of how, when he
played Hamlet as a young man, this
girl fell madly in love with him and
came round backstage to make his
acquaintance. He courted her and
when the time came he proposed to
her. She consented with one proviso:
“That I gave up the theatre.” A more
splendid story —from real life—tells how
Sir Plenry Irving had been feted at a
supper after having given an especially

fine performance. In the carriage on
the way home his wife started to
berate him: “When are you going to
give up all this trivial nonsense of the
theatre and settle down to something
serious?” It’s said that, without reply-
ing, Sir Henry stopped the carriage,
alighted, and went off into the night—
never to see or speak to his wife again.
Q.: Perhaps you have a bourgeois
prejudice against your vocation?
A.: Yes, I think so. It’s to do with
the. image of an actor in society as a
superficial, affected sort of person. I
know academics who don’t like being
thought of as “academic,” probably be-
cause the public have this tendency to
think of professors as pompous and
remote, impractical and perhaps even
impotent. Of course, it’s harder to be an
actor in Australia than elsewhere if
you consider that sometimes professional
actors are asked questions such as:
“Yes, I know you act, but what do you
do for a living?”
Q.: What do you think the public
expects an actor to be like in private
life?
A.: I suppose they might expect him
to be rather extravagant in his sexual
life. Or else homosexual. I have noticed
that there’s a cult of rugged “Aussie-
ness” among certain Sydney actors —as
though to crush any possible doubts
about their virility. I’m told this went
so far about ten years ago that a group
of prospering hirsute actors in radio put
the pressure on producers to exclude
from their casting lists any up-and-
coming young actors they suspected of
homosexuality. Which was quite out-
rageous. I’ve never heard of anything
similar in the theatre elsewhere.
Q.: Do you like the social side of
theatrical life? The backstage life?
A.: I hate the ingratiation and diplo-
macy, the tact and caution that is a
part of many actors’ lives. It’s summed
up in that odious word “contacts,” which
is, in fact, the title of an important
professional theatrical publication in
London. I find that I freeze up when
I’m supposed to turn on the charm or
try to prove that I’m a colorful per-
sonality. Probably I would have made
a much better career for myself in the
English theatre if I’d been able to cast
off the reserve in my nature that
abominates these expectations. Some-
times I dislike the gush of actors and
actresses the way they withhold them-
selves from controversy —though nowa-
days in England actors are not intimi-
dated the way they used to be. On the
other hand, there are many times when
I feel myself overflow with admiration
and joy at the innocence and gaiety
and sheer fun of theatre people. At a
party after a good first night, life can
seem pure honey, wild and abandoned,
yet somehow marvellously ordered and
lacking in any dark threat of violence.
At times like these you feel extra-
ordinarily hopeful about the human
race. One does learn a lot about Society
working in the theatre. If rehearsals are
going well everyone expects the best of
each other. One even gets an image of
the Perfect Society. Anfl when a pro-
duction comes off well there’s nothing
quite so exhilarating as that sense of
perfect teamwork without submerging
individuality. What you learn in work-
ing in the theatre is quite a profound
thing, really. Controversy is important,
but once you’re committed to a play
you must never let yourself question the
value of the enterprise. You take that
for granted. You have faith in it.
Q.: What ambitions do you have?
A.: The first one is to make money.
Q.: Aren’t you being too “disarming
and frank” to be believed?
A.: No, it really does come first to
me now. I don’t see how it’s possible
to have much freedom of artistic
choice without financial reserves. I
have no burning desires to play any
parts that have been denied me
although I would like to tackle Peer
Gynt and Cyrano before I’m too old
to play them. But I do want to produce
plays ranging across the whole
theatrical spectrum. Certainly my
.priorities would put plays by Brecht,
Shakespeare, Beckett, Shaw, Moliere
as the first choice, but I hope to pro-
duce opera, musicals, revue as well.
Q.: Aren’t you merely telling me the
most expedient way you might plan
your career?
A.: I admit I can’t really distinguish
now between considerations of personal
taste as against policy. I have little
desire to do “avant-garde” plays that
might attract an intelligent minority
and do poorly at the Box Office. In
Australia I think the “pocket” sort of
professional theatre does some disser-
vice to the cause of Drama in the
long run. It suggests exclusiveness, and
even, at times, a smug celebration of
that exclusiveness, the confirmation of
an elite. I don’t see any possibilities of
a big breakthrough in Australian
theatre until this arbitrary barrier
between “commercial” theatre and
serious drama is dissolved.
Q.: Would you suggest that the sort
of thing you do in the theatre is “com-
mercial”? Are you a “star”?
A.: If it pays off well, of course it
is. So I suppose I am a “star.” I have
noticed a strange- phenomenon here
among a few critics (and I stress
that they are few) who write as
though artistic success must necessarily
preclude success at the Box Office and
who feven give the impression that they
like this to be the case. Otherwise
the stock might become contaminated.
I could name a few instances where
critics have actually gone against the
evidence of Box Office success so that
they could indulge themselves in
reproaching the public for not “rally-
ing round” a fine' performance of a
play. The proposition they pose is as
crude as this: if it draws well it can’t
be that good. If it’s good it can’t draw
well.
... I ought to point out that these
critics come from the academic mould.
Q.: Do I get a whiff of anti-intel-
lectualism? Haven’t you been dubbed
an intellectual yourself?
A.: Well to some extent, of course,
I’m an intellectual. And I do hate the
mindless plunge into a pool of “feel-
ing” that characterises some “Method”
actors. However, I have become in-
creasingly intolerant of the bluntness
of the academic mind that refuses to
submit to the sensuous experience of
the theatre, that feels obligated to
abstract the literary quality of the text
from the total theatrical effect. Then
again I get hopping mad at the sort
of academic fatuousness and profundity
mongering that says things like
“Othello and lago are psychologically
two facets of a single mind”; or views
like the Leavis one that Othello was so
predisposed to jealousy that he asked
for all he got. So why have an Iago?
Reductio ad absurdum.
Q.: Isn’t it rather too convenient an
attitude? This anti-academic one?
Aren’t you aiming at being “pop”?
A.: I don’t think so, but I don’t look
on popularity as a dirty word. I
wouldn’t disqualify many plays from
consideration because they are “way
out” or “avant-garde.”
Q.: But you would exclude certain
good plays?
A.: Yes, some. For instance, I
wouldn’t put on a play like “End
Game” nowadays—even though Beckett
seems to me the greatest dramatist
alive—because I think it would do so
poorly at the Box Office as to reinforce
the argument that good drama must
appeal only to a very small minority.
But I don’t fall for the “mass audi-
ence” theory of value or any view that
quality and quantity of appeal have
a direct relationship. But I happen to
believe that Shakespeare, Brecht, Shaw,
Osborne, and even lonesco can be
successful enough here to warrant full-
scale professional productions in
medium-sized theatres. Good drama,
of course, will only appeal to a
minority. I happen to think that the
minority would be much larger than
it is—given the right conditions.
Q.: The right conditions. Isn’t that
a bit too generalised?
A.: Not at all. If Drama can find a
home at the Opera House—and there
are strong public forces sitting on the
Opera House Committee who don’t
give a damn about Drama and might
succeed in shoving it into the back-
yard—then there might be a future
for Drama in Sydney. Soon the die
will be cast.
Q.: Do you regard yourself as con-
servative or progressive or what in
your outlook on the theatre?
A.: Since I’ve come back to Aus-
tralia I’ve felt as though it might be
up to me to cross a few horizons.
Whereas in England during the
last period I had there, anyway I
sometimes felt a bit of a reactionary,
a sort of an outraged classicist. I found
it hard to take some of the excesses
of the New Wave or Social Realist
directors. I don’t like to see a play
turned into a tract of propaganda. No,


I must put it more precisely. I don’t
like to see this happen to a great
play, but when the Aldwych Theatre
gave the Social Realist treatment to
Marlowe’s “Jew of Malta,” so that
the Jew was transformed into a mag-
nificent Monster chastising Christian
hypocrisy, I couldn’t carp. It was
irresistible. I think “adapt or perish”
is fundamental in the theatre. And
I’ve come to believe that the approach
to a production of a play should often
be conditioned by elements in the
social climate oUthe day. Ten years
ago this would have seemed heresy to
me. In those times I believed there
might be such a thing as a definitive
production of a play and would have
tried to aim at such a thing myself.
Q.: What brought about the change
exactly?
A.: Working with Sir Laurence
Olivier was certainly a big influence on
me. In the Chichester company I was
able to observe him at close quarters.
He had just been appointed Director
of the National Theatre, and there
were many of the “New Wave” who
thought he was too old for the job
and that the appointment was a reac-
tionary one. It seemed to me that he
was consciously bent on countering this
view and out to demonstrate that he
was “with it”—even at the cost of some
artistic compromise. Most of his
appointees as directors had been asso-
ciated with the “new drama” at the
Court Theatre, and it was obvious to
most of the actors that some of the
things they had in mind wouldn’t work
well enough or perhaps not work at all.
Some of us expected an overruling
directive from above. Only once did it
ever come. I have little doubt that, in
the long run, this policy of “tolerance”
—which even involved personal insults
to Olivier himself that went unrebuked
—has been completely vindicated by
the triumphs of the National Theatre
in the past few years.
Q.: So—to put it in an unmistakable
way—you think that promotional or
political factors can be strong enough
to justify artistic compromises in the
production of a play?
A.: I know you’ll think I’m being
equivocal, but I’d say that sometimes
these compromises are the touchstone
to the social reality of a production.
Q.: “The social reality,” Oh, God!
A.: Put it this way. Each generation
looks at the past in a different way.
Today we would never accept the view
that the pre-Raphaelites took of the
Middle Ages, nor the view that Sir
Herbert Beerbohm Tree took of the
Elizabethans in his productions of the
’twenties. Who would have guessed,
twenty years ago, how easily films
would become “dated.”
Q.: Give me an example of this
“touchstone to reality.”
A.: All right, I’ll give you an example
that affronted me—Olivier’s approach
to the part of Othello. It was the
most audacious acting I have ever seen.
But so “with it” in depicting the Moor
with the accent and gait of a Camden
Town West Indian that I thought
scarcely any of Shakespeare’s play sur-
vived. But there’s no doubt that per-
formance will go down in the annals
as a “great” one. It is an enormously
popular performance. To me it was a
bit of a travesty, all the more painful
because it was given by the greatest
actor I have ever seen.
Q.: How did you get on with Olivier
personally?
A.: Uneasily. Perhaps because, to
start with, my feeling toward him was
almost one of veneration. I think he
suspected me as having too many
“ideas” and therefore perhaps not the
best material for the team.
Q.: An intellectual, even?
A.: I’m afraid so. What I found
daunting, even alarming about him—
the most perfect of actors —was the
absolute demonstration of “the power
of the mask,” the idea that no human
expression or intercourse is possible
without the use of an appropriate
persona. I’ve always accepted this
idea in theory, in Olivier one sees it
at work. In conversation he can
change a mask so abruptly that it is
breathtaking. And if he wants to
detach himself the remoteness is awe-
some. Peter O’Toole described Olivier
as “turning on that grey-eyed myopic
stare that can turn you to stone.”
Q.: Have any of your own per-
formances or productions since you
returned here been conditioned by this
desire to “meet the mood of the
time”?
A.: Most of them have. The two
early Australian plays I did in Adelaide
for the Festival attracted me because
of the thought that this country will
be more sure of its own identity when
it savors and relishes its own past. So,
too, was the Australian anthology “You
wouldn’t read about it,” which I have
toured in South Australia* and Queens-
land and will tour in New South
Wales this year. Also “The Restless
Years,” which I did for ABC Tele-
vision. I didn’t want to shove these
things down Australian throats like
some superior educationist. I certainly
wouldn’t have done them if I hadn’t
thought that there was something “in
the air” crying out to be faced with
these things. All of these things have
done extremely well at the Box Office.
And that is some sort of proof.
Q.: What about the idea of showing
yourself to the public here as a “good
Aussie,” not some highbrow snob
returned from overseas?
A.: That came into it. Though it
must be admitted that this interview
might suggest that I am some highbrow
snob returned from overseas.
Q.: Some more examples of “meet-
ing the mood of the time”?
A.: The other piece I did for the
Adelaide Festival was designed by me
quite consciously as a pamphlet that
reflected on the Vietnamese war. I
Wanted people to hear the inspired
commonsense of Shaw speaking fifty
years ago about the folly of branding
nationalist revolutions as “Bolshevik”
or “Communist.” All the more unas-
sailable, I thought, because history had
proved Shaw was right on the particu-
lar cases he cited. Two other produc-
tions I did last year had the Vietnamese
war in mind: “The Trojan Women,”
which I did in Adelaide last April,
and “The Business of Good Govern-
ment,” which I produced for the “Q”
Theatre here last year. Still I must
point out that I didn’t “slant” any of
these productions unfairly. I tried to
make them seem “imminent.”
Q.: Are you really committed to the
Left Wing in politics?
A.: No, not committed. I think the
degree of my “Leftism” varies accord-
ing to whether I’m in England or in
Australia.
In England I get very irritated by
the oversimplifications, the “dogmas”
of “Left Wing, liberal” thinking. And
certain important civilised battles of
thought , have been won over there.
People don’t brand politicians like
Michael Foot or, in the past, Bevan as
“Communist” or “fellow traveller”
because they are on the “left” of the
Labor Party. I think there are real
tendencies toward Macarthyism in Aus-
tralia.
Q.: Getting back to the theatre and
“commitment.” Was your performance
as “Dylan” “with it” in any way?
A.: I hate that term, but I suppose
I’ve asked for it. I tried to play
“Dylan” in an imminent way, with a
conscious regard for the texture of the
part. I wanted it to burst out of the
picture frame: The greatest compli-
ment I had was when somebody said
they felt they could smell that I was
a drunk as I lurched about the stage.
The physical impact of the perform-
ance seemed to me the first considera-
tion. And I deliberately introduced
muddy naturalistic smears to blur the
contours.
Q.: Out with the “slick gentlemanly
image” of the drawing-room actor.
But wasn’t this being unfair to a great
poet?
A.: I looked at it this way. The play
doesn’t and can’t do justice to the
responsible side of Thomas as an artist.
Taking the play on its own terms,
though, I felt it was possible to over-
come the slick magazine quality of
some of the writing by enriching the
texture, giving it a rougher, blemished
sort of surface. I felt particularly that
the younger members of the audience
might respond to this.
Q.: What’s your current venture?
A.: Producing “O’Flaherty VC” by
Shaw for the “Q” Theatre.
Q.: Was this your choice?
A.: No, but I recommended the
play.
Q.: Why?
A.: As an important statement about
war.
Q.: The war in Vietnam, you mean?
A.: Only in an oblique way. It cer-

tainly isn’t a play pleading compas-
sionately about the inhumanity of war.
It’s an anti-heroic play; realistic about
the military life but not what I’d call
an anti-war play. In fact, I think Shaw
might have meant it when he called
it “a recruiting pamphlet.”
Q.: Now tell me this: What is wrong
with the Australian theatre?
A.: I’m not sure that the Australian
public really want serious theatre.
Q.: Hasn’t your own success proved
that they do? Didn’t Barry Humphries’
last tour prove that?
A.: Perhaps. But too many of the
public still look on the theatre as an
“outmoded” form. And, considering
what’s usually offered to them, you
can’t blame them. I think that one
of the greatest enemies to theatrical
development here is the standard
thinking that aims at a “tidy” produc-
tion and equates professionalism
and polish and symmetry and even
“gentlemanliness” (perhaps it’s a
Colonial hangover, this) with quality
and dynamism. There’s no great debate
going on in our Society, so perhaps
we won’t get a real theatre until we
feel a sense of crisis among us. Joan
Littlewood would probably be the best
thing that could happen to the Aus-
tralian theatre. She’d jump on our
snobberies.
Q.: Do you really like Australia and
Australians or is this country just a
convenient place for you?
A.: I’m going to play the artist
with a “mystique” on that one. I am
discovering myself through my work,
and especially in the Australian
material I do. And I need an Austra-
lian “myth” to make life supportable
here. I do like touring Australian
country towns, but a walk through some
of our cities often leaves me feeling
desolate as though no shadow was
being cast. Maybe Culture is only
needed here to fill in the gaps of bore-
dom in an affluent society; maybe it
goes deeper than that. I don’t know.
The first thing to be done for the
serious theatre here and I’ve said
this often enough to be parrotish—is
a very matter-of-fact operation: put
more bars and restaurants into the
theatre buildings. Make the theatre a
pleasant place with lots of amenities.
The second thing is to ensure that a
great deal more of the public money
allocated to subsidise the theatre finds
its way into the actors' pockets.
Q.: Would you like to see the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust disbanded?
A.: I must say I would—even though
I expect considerable help from them
in putting on a season of classical plays
in Sydney this year.
Q.: What would take its place?
A.: An Arts Council on the lines of
the British Arts Council. If instead
we have a Performing Arts Council
then I think it should be divided into
three separate councils for each of the
performing arts, each with their own
separate allocations. Opera and Ballet
are undoubtedly treated with favoritism
by the Elizabethan Theatre Trust. They
have more “honeyed” reputations in
the public mind, too. I think that
three such distributing bodies—that is
if we don’t get an Arts Council —
should be as lightweight as possible so
that the machinery doesn’t get bureau-
cratic and absorb most of the funds.
Put the money as simply as possible
into the hands of existing theatrical
groups that have shown their mettle—
the “Q” Theatre and the Independent
Theatre, for instance.
Q.: Your views on the Opera House?
A.: This might be the last chance for
serious drama in Sydney for many a
long day. If the original plans go
through—and it’s depressing how few
people had protested against them be-
fore the new plans were announced —
then serious Drama will be doomed as
a minority elite interest here in Sydney.
If the amended plans—which allow
scope for plays in an experimental
theatre, a medium-sized theatre, and a
large one —are adopted, then the future
could be good. Sydney could certainly
have a permanent professional drama
company on those terms. I don’t think
I’d stay in Sydney that much longer
if the “Opera House” turned out to be
a monumental “Folly” dedicated to the
victory of “Prestige” culture over a
genuine dynamic Australian culture.

WHY?
When Rover set out
to design the ‘2ooo’
they threw the book away. There
is nothing of standard pattern
about this car, no concession to “popular”
taste. What Rover did was to design a car
from the tyres up not according to how
cars were, but according to how they
should be.-For instance, a car should “go”
and it also should stop. So the ‘2ooo’ has a
totally new overhead camshaft engine that
produces tremendous thrust. It can go
like a rocket. But it also has disc brakes all
round and radial ply tyres so it can stop
faster, more safely than any car you've
ever driven. A car should “handle” per-
fectly under all road conditions. So the
‘2ooo’ got itself a totally new suspension,
so good that the motoring writers have run

THE ABSOLUTE CAR
out of superlatives. A car should protect
its occupants. So Rover designed the pas-
senger compartment as a rigid steel cage,
buffered at each end by a bonnet and boot
which “accordion” gradually on impact.
Then they carefully built in an incredible
fifty safety features. (They’re illustrated in
a leaflet we’ll gladly send you.) Finally, a
car should have three personalities to suit
the mood of the driver. It should be a rip-
roaring sports car, a long-loping, mile-

lavishly-appointed luxury limousine. The
Rover ‘2ooo’ is all these things. It is the
mailed fist in the velvet glove. It is the
absolute car.

THE fair name of the sauna bath has
been sullied in Sydney of late.
Moralists have denounced the city’s
so-called sauna studios as places of
ill fame. They share the disrepute of
the massage parlors with which they
are commonly associated.
The poster ads for these establish-
ments do little to dispel the idea that
they have some ulterior functions.
“Yvonne’s Sauna Bath Butterfly
Massage a Specialty,” says a typical
notice. Another reads: “Lolita’s Con-
tinental Sauna All Facilities Avail-
able.” The industry seems to be a
feminine preserve. There are no posters
extolling Fred’s Sauna Studio or
Harry’s Massage Parlor.
This state of affairs doubtless causes
distress to respectable masseuses who
provide bona fide butterfly massage
and wholesome sauna baths. But as
things are in Sydney, one can be excused
for wondering whether sauna baths may
have dubious associations in Finland,
where they originated.
Fortunately, some first-hand evid-
ence is available on the matter. Colin
Simpson, Sydney travel writer, lately
visited Finland and sampled a sauna
bath. From the account in his book,
The Viking Circle, Mr. Simpson found
the Finnish sauna to be very uncom-
fortable and totally lacking in erotic
stimulation.
Contrary to popular legend, the
sexes take their baths -separately. The
author quotes a Finnish authority as
saying: “Two places are holy the
church and the sauna. In the sauna
one should behave as one does in
church.”
Mr. Simpson was taken first into a
room where water was thrown on to hot
stones till the air temperature reached
205 (seven degrees below boiling
point). Then, gasping and feeling like
a poached egg, he was led outside and
told to jump in the lake. If snow had
been available he would have been
expected to roll in it. He went through
this hot-and-cold ordeal twice.
At one stage, it is true, he was
scrubbed by a burly female Finn of
about 50. But she was a very different
type from the Michelles and Yvonnes
of Kings Cross.
Clearly the Sydney sauna studios are
a much modified variety. They cater
satisfactorily for their local clientele,
but they cause a good deal of per-
plexity to visitors from Finland.
A case has come to my notice, that
of a young seaman named Paavo
Sibelius. When his ship stopped in
Sydney, he went ashore and said to a
taxi driver: “Sauna bath you show
me way to sauna?”
The driver winked and said: “Hop
in. I’ll take you to Justine’s. She runs
the best sauna joint in town.”
“Is good hot sauna?” the young Finn
asked.
“Yes, mate. You’ll have a hot time
all right.”
At Justine’s place Paavo was surprised
by the voluptuous atmosphere. Justine
welcomed him, and introduced him to
some young ladies in informal attire.
“These are our sauna attendants,”
she said. “Girls, meet Paavo.”
An attractive brunette came over to
him. “Hi,” she said. “Do you feel like
a drink or two first?”
“I no drink in sauna,” said Paavo.
“Sauna is holy place, like church.”
She gave him a curious look.
“OK, just as you please,” she said.
“I think I’ll have a grog myself. Looks
as if I’ll need it.”
“Is your sauna boiling hot?” he said.
“Certainly not. We’ve got air-condi-
tioning here. Nothing but the best.”
“But sauna not boiling is no good!
How much your sauna cost?” he said
suspiciously.
“It’s 30 dollars, Jack, and you won’t
get a better deal in Sydney.”
“Thirty dollars for sauna! Is: too
much. Have you any snow?”
“Snow! So that’s what you’re after.
I’m going to speak to the boss.”
A moment later Justine came up to
Paavo. “Get out, you!” she said. “This
is a decent sauna studio. We don’t
peddle snow here.”
Paavo had a strange tale to tell when
he got back to Helsinki . . .
There is a need for some genuine
sauna baths in Sydney for Finnish
visitors. Perhaps Mr. Simpson might
care to open one. It could put honest
ads in the Press, instead of on posters:
“Colin’s Dinkum Sauna Discomfort
Guaranteed.”

AROUND MELBOURNE
Has Anyone Here Seen Kelly?
ACTUALLY Melbourne has
always been a good fly town.
If under Sir Henry we decide
to become an independent sovereign
State, then we will need some sym-
bolic sounds for our Radio Victoria,
just as Radio Australia uses the
laugh of the kookaburra.
Perhaps it would be best to open
up with three: the musical sound of
an empty beer can clanking down
the steps at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground, the slap of a hand hitting
the bottom of a tomato-sauce bottle,
and the sound of a blowfly bashing
its head against a window.
John Batman had a fly problem
and indeed most of the chroniclers
of Melbourne talk of flies. The best
of them all, though, is that enter-
taining Irishman William Kelly.
In his “Life in Victoria,” he says:
“The fly nuisance in the summer of
1853 was something akin to a plague.
They abounded in million myriads
everywhere; they almost darkened
the air, and were so unbearably
saucy and obtrusive that many
people armed themselves with what
they called horse-tail twigs to thrash
them away. But thrash away until
your arm ached, the moment you
paused, fresh legions, as if incensed
at your brutality, swarmed upon you
in buzzing viciousness, straddling
one another’s backs in their desire
to have revenge, the more daring
forcing their way up your nostrils
and into the corners of your eyes.
All shops seemed alive with them,
especially butcher shops; and when
a hanging quarter of beef was dis-
turbed on the hooks the insect up-
roar which ensued was positively
startling . . .”
Well, William Kelly did a
splendid job of telling the world of
the unique qualities of our flies.
After him our best publicist was
Prince Charles at Timbertop. You
may remember that Timbertop has
these fascinating flytraps. There is a
glass bowl, a kerosine tin with holes
in it, and a lump of meat. The flies,
attracted by the smell of meat, fly
through holes punched in the tin.
When they try to get out they fly
up through a tube where they are
trapped in a bowl of water.
Cleaning the flytraps is a ros-
tered duty at Timbertop and an
enterprising photographer caught
Prince Charles doing this. Unques-
tionably it was the most fascinating
royal photograph of 1966.
These past four years the anti-fly
campaign has been in the hands of
a public relations firm, Leonard
Barker & Associates. This year a
large gold-embossed card came in
with the message “The Lord Mayor
and Lady Mayoress request the
pleasure of the company of ... .
at a reception to the launching
of the Fly Control Campaign for
1967.” The invitation added “Dress
Informal.” Many of us felt that this
was typical of the down-to-earth-
get-on-with-the-job Melbourne way
of doing things that we could forgo
white tie and medals for the opening
of a fly campaign.
Everybody was there, including
councillors’ ladies in their best
cocktail frocks. Champagne and hors-
d’oeuvre were served and in the
corner was the enemy, a huge model
of a house fly. As John Hamilton
of “The Age” pointed out: “It was
only fitting that this enormous model
of a fly should be suitably tagged,
because we had all received lapel
badges proclaiming our respective
identities before we entered.” Across
the wingspan of the fly was the label
“I AM MUSCA DOMESTICA.”
The Lord Mayor, Cr. Beaurepaire,
who sadly collected the title “Lord
of the Flies,” announced the quiz
competition with the holiday prizes
worth $lO,OOO. The first prize is a
holiday trip for two, with $5OO in
travellers’ cheques, by Alitalia to
Austria, Germany, Switzerland,
Hong Kong, or Japan. The second
prize for two is to Perth and the
third to Surfers Paradise.
In order to win this competition
the householder fills out one of
500,000 forms which have such
questions as “Do you always wrap
all rubbish before placing in a rub-
bish bin? Yes? No?” . . . “Do you
use only garden refuse in your com-
“We won our overseas trip for
getting rid of Victoria’s flies.”
post heap? Yes? No?” The first
three correct entries opened out of
a pile of 500,000 letters win the
prizes.
Your correspondent sought out
Mr. Len Barker and asked him
what was the point of this lottery.
“It’s an education program,” he
said. “If we can control the places
where flies breed by teaching
householders clean habits, we can
get rid of flies.”
Mr. Barker went on to say that
mass spraying would not only be
enormously expensive but totally
ineffective . . . the only way to stop
them breeding in the first place is
at home.
To the suggestion that the
$lO,OOO might be better used in
bringing out Chairman Mao’s fly-
control man, he said aggressively:
“This business about China and its
flies and every Chinese killing 50
a day is a great myth. It is only
in a rich society that you get a large
number of flies.”
Mr. Barker was utterly convinced
that this education could work. “And
do you know why we picked Perth
for the second prize? The contestant
can go to a town where there are
very few flies. The City of Perth
has worked on similar lines to this
and their campaign has been very
successful.”
Your correspondent was still a
little disappointed that this campaign
by 24 out of Melbourne’s 44 muni-
cipalities did not involve some direct
spraying action against the fly.
Admittedly, most sprays do not
work, but one could refer His
Worship the Mayor to William
Kelly’s book, page 339. In 1853, said
he, the flies came into his house
like the exhaustless armies of Darius.
“I brought home on one occasion
a fly poison which was in general
use in the city and environs. It was
a powder which dissolved in water,
and, exposed on plates throughout
the house, spread about a vapor
very fatal to them. They fell by mil-
lions of millions, you crushed them
as you walked across the carpet,
they dropped paralysed into your
wine, inter poculum et labra.
“I declare most solemnly I saw
the housemaid, for the 10th time
of the day, take the dust-pan and
hand-brush and sweep from the
carpet a heap of dead flies that
would count by hundreds of thou-
sands.”
You know, this could be the
answer. Has anyone here seen Kelly?

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
“Googie’s Coming Back”
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
GOOGIE WITHERS nearly fell off
her seat the first time she met
another Googie. It was a man. A
great big lout playing the part of a
gangster in a film. The second was
also a man. A gentleman in New York
theatre called Vincent Stuart, whose
wife spun round while entertaining Miss
Withers and ordered Googie to fetch
something but quick from the kitchen.
Miss Withers, rather surprisdd, was
relieved to hear she meant Mr. Stuart.
In fact, Miss Withers has a contin-
ental mother and was christened
Georgette Lysette. An Indian ayah
nicknamed her Googie as a baby and
for a long time everyone thought this
meant Little Love. One day someone
who knew their ayahs better said where
this one came from it meant Clown.
Anyway, it has stuck. They tried to
change it when she went into straight
acting, and Miss Withers spent a sleep-
less night wondering what to do.
Georgina Withers would have sounded
all right, and Georgie rather fun, but
superstition prevailed: she had done
very well under Googie and breaking
the ayah’s spell would be madness. “I
wanted,” she said, “to prove I could
do as well in drama with a kinky name
like Googie after all, Ginger Rogers
did and I think I did.”
Miss Withers has, as long as one
could remember, done well. We last
met eight years ago at Buckingham
Palace, a surq sign of doing well
(excepting Press) on the eve of her
husband’s' (John McCallum) departure
for Australia. She wore suitable garden-
party clothes and her hair was brunette.
Our next meeting, a week ago, in a
friend’s borrowed Sydney flat, Miss
Withers had gone blonde. Going blonde,
she says, is better than dyeing black
' because that looks dyed. She doesn’t
know what color her hair really is, she
hasn’t seen it for such a long time, but
she thinks it might be grey.
This particular day, Miss Withers
had driven from her holiday home at
Palm Beach with her children and
nanny to Sydney. The friend’s bor-
rowed flat had a chintzy sofa and into
this Miss Withers sank, showing rather
more stocking-top than one would
expect from the Queen of Australian
theatre. She derides this image of her-
self and says in England she is just
another actor, treated like everyone
else. She could see, however, that the
combination of English box-office
appeal and being married to a J. G.
Williamson man could provoke such a
title. “Actors are always complaining
about management, and I suppose
people thought I would run to John and
say we’ve got a lot of moaners here
and,” with a Googie twinkle, “I prob-
ably would.”
Poised on the brink of her first
return to England in two-and-a-bit
years, where she has a seven-month
contract in Shaw’s “Getting Married,”
with a five-week tour booked in Man-
chester but, as yet, no London theatre,
Miss Withers looked forward (apart
from other Mancunian delights like
ghastly weather and grim provinces) to
meeting London taxi-drivers. They greet
her witK “It’s lovely to see you, Googie,
what play are you in?” and through
all that glass plate window hold ani-
mated conversations about the theatre.
In Australia, taxi-drivers look her
straight in the eye and ask when is
she going to give up this acting lark
and settle down and look after her
husband and home?
F... is extraordinary, says Miss
Withers, how even Australian women
apologise if they call her by her maiden
name, but it’s not an insult. They
come up to her at some function or
other and say, “Please tell us what to
call you, Miss Withers or Mrs. Mc-
Callum?” Men don’t hesitate. It’s Mrs.
McCallum, always.
She has taken one step toward
home-making and bought a house at
Pittwater. After her husband’s break
with Williamson’s she vowed not to
put down roots for at least the next
two years. But they got a good price
for their Melbourne house, and, quite
by chance, came across this house. It
was the first Miss Withers has been
into in Australia that made her say
“This is for me.”
Life for Miss Withers in Australia
is marvellous. Any frustrations she may
have felt like lack of public response
to her first Australian-written play,
“Desire of the Moth”—are counter-
acted by the knowledge that her ser-
vices are still much in demand. News-
paper cuttings keep coming from Eng-
land saying “Googie’s Coming Back.”
It is wonderful, she says, to be wanted.
She is accustomed now to lack of theatre
talk with friends in Australia. In fact,
they often walk to the other side of the
room at parties because they haven’t
seen her in whatever she is in at the
time. “Sorry, darling, they say, we’re
so busy.” “Busy at what?” demands
Miss Withers. “Busy at boring cocktail
parties, that’s all they do.”
Miss Withers is not bitter about the
Williamson affair. Her husband has had
many offers for other things and she
does not deny that one is director of
the Elizabethan Trust; on the other
hand, she knows he is keen on making
television films. What Australia really
needs, however, is National Theatre,
and if that ever happened—who knows?
Meanwhile, Miss Withers celebrates
her 50th bjrthday on March 12 in Man-
chester. “Getting Married” opens on her
husband’s birthday, on March 14.
Normally, they celebrate on the 13th
with a joint party. This year Mr.
McCallum will be at home, meditating
as to the future, in the company of
their dog.

Sydney: Around Australia every day, Brambles cranes lift high and
heavy. At the Balmain terminal of the roll-on roll-off ferry “Empress
of Australia” a fabricated steel “Raw Mill” shell weighing 21 tons
was manoeuvred into the ship’s rear-loading hatch by two Brambles
mobile cranes. The mill shell was fabricated by Ronald J. Murray
& Sons Pty. Ltd., of Auburn, to the design of Humphreys & Glasgow
Limited, who are installing the complete plant for Goliath Portland
Cement Co. Pty. Ltd., of Railton, Tasmania.
Adelaide: “Pioneering was never like this,” could well have been
the comment of explorer Charles Sturt when his statue was lifted
bodily in Victoria Square for relocation. Of cast bronze, the weight
of the 50-year-old statue and its pedestal is 45 tons.
Brisbane: 170 feet of jib was used to place a stiff-legged crane on
top of new wheat silos at the Australian Wheat Board terminal at
Pinkenbah. Construction was by A. H. Hodge & Son of
Toowoomba, and Brambles cranes have worked on this project
since its commencement.

The photographs show Manford’s dockside hoppers
manufacturing plant and a “super” spreading team
at Esperance port for receiving rock phosphate forio the superphosphate
taking a break during operations on a farm in twice development area.
The Esperance district of Western Australia, four hundred miles from
Perth on the Great Australian Bight, is undergoing rapid development
as the results of scientific research and today’s modern techniques
open up vast tracts of land for agriculture right on the edge of the
Nullarbor Plain.
Esperance is just one of the pioneering successes currently being
achieved in Western Australia. Along with the mining of iron ore and
other fantastically wealthy mineral deposits, the discovery of oil on
Barrow Island and the building of space research and tracking
stations, Esperance is adding to the State’s advancement. “Brambles
News first featured Esperance in April, 1965, but even in the 22
months since then, progress has been marked.
Brambles association with Esperance is through its West Australian
transport operation of Frank Manford Pty. Limited. Manford’s service
to Esperance goes back to the early 1930’5, when a shipping clerk
regularly made the 24-hour journey by train from Perth to attend
to the clearance of cargo coming through Esperance port and
destined for Norseman and Kalgoorlie. Manford’s also handled the
shipment of fuel oil for the goldmines at Kalgoorlie, from the port
storage facilities. In those early days a quarter acre of land was sold
in the township for as little as 10c a block for the non-payment of
rates. The same blocks now fetch between $l6OO and $2OOO.
Esperance Downs was first settled in 1866 and the possibility of
developing the soil for agriculture was quickly discovered. The first
town and the port of Esperance came into being in 1893 when the
Coolgardie goldfields required a port in the Great Australian Bight.
The fortunes of the port rose and fell with the luck of the goldmines
and when good roads were opened up, which by-passed Esperance,
the town regressed. But farmers attracted to the area because of
the steady, if not plentiful rainfall, discovered ways of growing wheat
in the “mallee” and for a time Esperance boomed again as the
wheat port for the mallee, but the farms could not maintain their
successes and Esperance suffered once again.
Agricultural experiment and research in the area was made over the
years, but development was so slow that even in 1948 Esperance
Downs was still almost totally undeveloped. In 1949 the Western
Australian Government established the Esperance Downs Research
Station, the work of which has provided a firm base for expanding
primary production in the area.
Since then, progress has been rapid and dramatic. Within the next
10 years the “wasteland" on the edge of the Nullarbor Plain at
Esperance will be fully transformed into first-class pasture lands.
An indication of the rapid pace of development is the growth from
197 farms, totalling 325,200 acres under development in 1957/58
to 650 farms covering one million acres at the end of the 1965/66
season.
t! 1960, Manford’s opened a branch in Esperance and today the
jlmpany has an office and workshop on four acres of land, fleets
rtip trucks, superphosphate spreading units, semi-trailers and flat-
,p general-purpose units. The Company’s main operation is the
jrtage of rock phosphate from the ships to the new superphosphate
Manufacturing plant at Esperance. Cartage of rock phosphate and
filphur each year totals between 60,000 and 70,000 tons. Bagged
: iperphosphate from the new manufacturing plant at Esperance is
i so carted to farms up to 70 miles east and west of the township.
7 rain cartage is another important operation—from the farms to the
nheat silos at Esperance and from there to the ships at the $3 million
■ nd-backed berth. The cartage figures for phosphate and wheat
■uring December, 1966, alone totalled 41,000 tons. The Company
/ perates regular road services between Esperance and Albany.
-part from cartage contracts, the Company has a franchise with the
t uperphosphate works to carry out “super" spreading in the
; sperance area. Superphosphate is essential to the development of
lasture lands and the area served by Manford's is the largest of its
Vnd in the State.
(fie future of Esperance is now assured. It is a drought-free area
and the use of trace elements has made it possible to carry four or
live sheep to the acre. It has been predicted that, eventually,
Tsperance will carry a sheep population equal to the State’s present
total of some 20 million.
Not all in the hinterland .

Manford’s transport vehicles hauled the longest roofing sections ever to be

shopping centre site, where Dixon Bros.’ cranes unloaded the roofing and
placed it in position. The roofing sections were 80 feet in length and covered
a total area of 42,333 square feet. In all, the sections weighed 31 tons.

This could well be the remark on a first look at this 1916
advertisement for FIAT trucks. What is interesting about
the advertisement, published in the “Sydney Mail” in
June, 1916, is that it features one of the trucks in use
by Brambles at the time. The vehicle was based in
Newcastle, where the Brambles story began. The remark
of one of today’s Brambles executives is worth record-
ing: “How would the old FIAT go on the overnight run to
Melbourne with those solid tyres.”
While on the subject of the unusual, Brambles Bond and

The rail tanker carried the Butane

freight rail terminal in Victoria and
was unloaded by the Brambles road
tanker, which made three trips be-
tween the rail terminal and the con-
signee. Butane is converted to liquid
under pressure and the method of
transfer was to increase the pressure
in the rail tanker so that liquid flowed
into the lower pressure road tanker. A

PERTH FESTIVAL, THEATRE
Cultural Barriers
PERTH’S 15 th Festival was
launched, not with a literary
prologue or trumpet fanfare, but
with a politician’s speech which would
have been more appropriate to the
opening of a blast furnace than a sea-
son of culture.
Industrial Development Minister
Charles Court, who is not known for
any cultural affinity, apart from a
ticket in the Musicians’ Union, was
considered by many to be a strange
choice or perhaps a sop to the State
Government, which gave a $6OOO sub-
sidy. His flippant, matey speech to a
shirt-sleeved audience of 600, cooling
off after a day of near-century heat in
the University’s Elizabethan-replica
New Fortune Theatre, did not set an
appropriate atmosphere for the open-
ing of Peter Shaffer’s “Royal Hunt of
the Sun.” But this is Perth.
The play opened vigorously, and
director John Tasker used the square,
open stage imaginatively. But it suf-
fered from some overacting, excessive
length, and the inability of the actors
to adjust to the excellent acoustics but
temperamental winds that affect the
open-air theatre. “The Royal Hunt,”
a spectacular color and movement
attempt to combine the intimacy of
theatre with the grandeur of cinema,
lost its main theme in a morass of
tributaries that left the audience
puzzled. The play failed as an intellec-
tual exercise, but succeeded in action,
fine presentation, and fine acting from
three or four principals, notably Alan
Lander as the Inca.
But it was not the most auspicious
start to the Festival, and the second
offering, four days later, did nothing to
rectify the situation. This was Bernard
Hesling’s autobiographical comedy, “My
Life with an Interval for Asperin,”
staged at the National Theatre’s Play-
house. The play had more faults than
advantages, despite the genuine humor.
But “My Life” never really left the
ground. It started abruptly, catching
the audience unawares in the middle
of first-night chit-chat, and that, of
course, is a very rude thing for a play
to do. The production, which should
have been as tight and slick as a TV
comedy show (for which, suitably
toned, it is probably well fitted),
dragged into each scene at the pace of
Hesling’s quaintly slow and quavering
speech.
Two days later, the first week’s final
theatrical offering started an eight-day
season in King’s Park Tennis Club
when Stefan Haag’s Aboriginal Theatre
opened, with a bush backdrop under a
starlit sky, to a big and enthusiastic
crowd.
Comparisons with the other two
presentations are impossibly unfair, yet
judging from audience reaction and
after-show comments, it will probably
be one of the most popular entertain-
ments offered. Curiosity probably
attracted many people. The dancing
and music was as alien to the whites
as it was to the big number of part-
Aborigines from Perth’s growing native
population, who got a chance to see
their cultural past for the first time.
The home-grown production was
world class, the program, danced by
men from Bathurst and Yirrkala
Islands, well balanced, the entertain-
ment unique.
And slowly, as the program pro-
gressed, the audience became aware of
how little they knew of the land they
possessed, and how impossible it would
be ever to discover or interpret it so
well. The audience left, stimulated,
wondering, curious emotions not
aroused by the other two shows. There
must be a moral here somewhere.
DUNCAN GRAHAM
PERTH FESTIVAL, ART
Well Played!
Elwyn Lynn, Skinner Gallery, Perth.
THIS is the first Elwyn Lynn
exhibition that Perth has seen,
and the first that this critic has
seen since the one at the Clune Gal-
leries, Sydney, in 1965; it is very im-
pressive, the works are all extremely
interesting, and the style is deepening.
The paintings if this is the right
label for these painted collage objects
are less nervous than they used to
be, and on the whole less witty, but
grander and altogether more confident.
They allude to large themes, and the
wonderful texturing of a surface, or
the absolute assurance of an arabesque
cut with a razor into a layer of canvas
can ensure that we take the allusion
as seriously as it is made; Vault, for
instance, with a slash out of it like a
text from the Koran and with a
mottled protractor-shaped “sky,” be-
comes an ideogram from some lost
cosmology. Atlantis looks like an aerial
photograph of the ruins and traces of
a vast highway flyover system, and
looking at it one thinks the expected,
if obvious, thoughts.
Sometimes the feeling is less obscure,
less grandiloquent, and in Storm Over
Junee two landscape conventions are
combined, on a grave low-toned sur-
face, to produce a gently Wordsworth-
ian essay in nature mysticism.
For all the evolution of style, though,
the old wit and wilfulness are not en-
tirely absent; Linguistics, a scroll or
charter with six seals set off against
a few scraps of printed paper, makes
some obscure, wry comment on some-
thing: or is it all simply decoration?
If it doesn’t quite illustrate Freud
on wit, Elwyn Lynn’s painting instances
Kant’s notion of the aesthetic as a
function of the free play of the imagina-
tion, and Lynn takes his play as
seriously as other Australians take
cricket.
Nor is the analogy quite pointless:
“Cricket,” some Frenchman once said,
“is the only model that the Anglo-
Saxon has of eternity,” and Elwyn
Lynn’s curious, quasi-pictorial near
objects are full of hints about, and in-
vite thoughts of, remote and curious
areas of space, lost deltas and forgotten
harbors, and they evoke immense,
altogether geological, tracts of time,
but all under your very nose, with cut
canvas, paint, and very ordinary odds
and ends: here is a well-tempered
imagination. Or, to put it in a more
familiar idiom: “Well played, sir!”
PATRICK HUTCHINGS
TELEVISION
All in Fun
MANY years ago when I bought a
television receiver, one of the first
shows I saw was “It Could Be
You,” compered by Tommy Hanlon. My
1961 cry of denial was loud and bitter.
Last week duty compelled me to watch
the same gentleman at work in his first
new venture since then, called, for
originality’s sake, “The Tommy Hanlon
Show.” And what changes had time
wrought? In the audience, few; in Han-
lon, none.
The grim, grey, Melbourne ladies of
1961 had found some other enterprise
to follow, possibly knitting scarves be-
hind the barricades outside Pentridge
Jail, and the Hanlon audience had
become a younger, more cheerful lot,
although no less eager to gape and
giggle at the squirmings of volunteers
willing to be mentally tortured by the
Master, whose methods make Bob
Dyer seem an innocent amateur.
The show began with an announce-
ment by Jack Little (more recently
famed as a “rassling” commentator)
who cried “The Tarmy Hanlon
Show!” with the same old fervor, a
second before “Tarmy” sprang from his
seat in the audience, microphone in
hand, viscose suit shining and curls
a-bobbing. “Tell-ya-what-aldo,” he said
for the first of 395 times, and gave his
first volunteer a bewildering choice of
prizes, half-prizes, other prizes, and
non-prizes, hidden behind No. 1, 2 or
3 curtains, plus or minus X or Y
numbers of dollars.
While Hanlon’s deservedly popular
show (in the sense that the mass
audience gets the kind of show it
deserves) went its merry way, the ITS
channel was showing something called
“Gordon and the Girls,” a Hector
Crawford production which appeared
to be a tilt not at Hanlon but at
Channel 7’s “Beauty and the Beast.”
Gordon Boyd was as polite as Stuart
Wagstaff, even to applying an obvious
misnomer to his ladies. He asked a few
questions, gave a few prizes, invited
Mrs. Hector Crawford (Glenda Ray-
mond) to sing, and encouraged others
to emulate her, although it was not
billed as “Tryouts for Showcase ’67.”
To sum up, daytime television has
some new shows. Ho hum. Back to the
old ironing board for real entertain-
ment.

THEATRE
Waiting for Julia
Green Julia. Paul Albeman, Ensemble,
Sydney.
The Schoolmistress. Pinero, Old Tote,
Sydney.
The Sound of Morley. Phillip, Sydney.
IN “Green Julia” Jake and Bob, who
have shared “digs” together as
students for five years, spend their
last evening together waiting for Julia,
Jake’s mistress, to turn up and drink
a farewell bottle of champagne with
them. As they wait they talk and
joke and play a kind of parody game
in which, as “Carruthers” and “Brad-
shaw,” they assume various roles, im-
personating now a couple of guttural
psychiatrists, now an Irish priest and
his Bishop, now a Colonel and his
native boy.
Like so many modern comedies, this
is a comedy of language rather than
of character or situation. Like Godot,
Julia does not appear, but not for any
metaphysical reasons. “Green Julia”
is a realistic study of the relationship
and attitudes of the two young men,
which emerge gradually as they discuss
Julia.
Although “Green Julia” does not
have the poetic or metaphysical over-
tones of “Waiting for Godot,” it does
need the same kind of skilful comic
playing. James H. Bowles is a very
promising young comedian, but Sandy
Harbutt is not a natural comic talent
and he appeared to lack firm direction
from Reg Evans, the producer.
Pinero’s farce had an enthusiastic
reception when it was presented at
the Old Tote six months ago by the
N.I.D.A. students under the direction
of Alan Edwards. Now the Old Tote
Theatre Company, under the direction
of Alexander Hay, presents a de luxe
edition with lavish costumes and
elaborate setting designed by Ron Reid.
The difference between this and the
student production can probably best
be indicated by saying that in this one
the cast sit on real Victorian furniture,
surrounded by jardinieres and potted
palms, and drink real champagne.
Of a proficient cast Judith Fisher
shines as the spirited Peggy Hesslerigge,
Jacki Weaver, all golden curls and baby
voice, is the irresistible young bride
Dinah, while Martin Harris is her
absurdly jealous young husband, Regin-
ald Paulover. Alan Edwards is all
lisp and petulance as the impeccable
and penniless Hon. Vere Queckett.
As Lieut. Mallory, R.N., the Hon.
Vere’s gay bachelor friend, Robin Cum-
ing gives a faultless performance. Owen
Weingott’s crusty Admiral Rankling
is a really hammed-up old salt.
In spite of the lavishness of this
production I must admit to having
enjoyed the student production more.
Partly, no doubt, because such a light,
frothy farce does not stand up to being-
viewed twice in six months. But also
because the bright-eyed enthusiasm and
even the unpretentiousness of the
student production gave it a delightful
freshness and liveliness.
Mr. Robert Morley, rotund of figure
and orotund of speech, is an actor in
the grand manner, who imposes his
own style and stamp on everything he
does.
In “The Sound of Morley” he pre-
sents himself, his reminiscences about
his childhood in Folkestone and the
imperious bridge-playing old ladies
who dominated it, his first visit to
the theatre and his early experiences
as a young repertory actor. He men-
tions his first trip to Australia, does
an extract from “Edward, My Son,”
a speech as Oscar Wilde and a very
amusing sketch showing his idea of
how Wilson, de Gaulle, and Johnson
might appear in the bath.
Robert Morley emerges as a civilised
English gentleman, witty, graceful, and
fluent, with plenty of quirks and no
dogmas.

FILMS
Taking Cary
for Granted
Walk, Don’t Run. Director, Charles
Walters.
What Did You Do In The War,
Daddy? Director, Blake Edwards.
The Gentle Art Of Seduction.
Director, Edouard Molinari.
A WEEK for comedies, entertain-
ing in varying degrees, but not
particularly stimulating. Cer-
tainly none is real failure -- a
comedy that doesn’t come off is one
of the moviegoer’s most painful experi-
ences but there’s not a real belly-
laugh among them.
“Walk, Don’t Run” is certainly the
most successful, pleasantly sunny in
mood, expertly made, and with the
inestimable advantage of Cary Grant,
whose comedy timing is as remarkable
as his ageless charm. The latter, in
fact, rather militates against the con-
viction of the plot engaging as
Jim Hutton is, it’s impossible to believe
that any girl would have bothered with
him with the old maestro around.
This is a remake of a classic comedy,
“The More The Merrier,” and it is
sadly obvious that Samantha Eggar is
no Jean Arthur; but though she
doesn’t impress greatly as a comedi-
enne she’s as pretty as paint. In any
case, Grant and Jim Hutton are per-
fectly capable of taking care of the
comedy, and this is a smooth, diverting
movie though totally unmemorable.
Like all Blake Edwards’ films, “What
Did You Do In The War, Daddy?”
uses all its jokes several times over,
and they aren’t in any case quite as
funny as director and scriptwriter
evidently thought. But Edwards cer-
tainly keeps things moving, even if it
is over the same ground, and his cast,
headed by James Coburn and Dick
Shawn, is remarkably capable.
Neither Charles Walters nor Blake
Edwards has attempted any origin-
ality of direction, confining their efforts
to straightforward photographing of
the action. Molinari in “The Gentle
Art Of Seduction” has tried a few
new tricks which sit rather uneasily
on the basically old-fashioned treat-
ment. This is a harmlessly “naughty”
movie which may have been funnier
in its own language. Jean-Claude
Brialy and Francoise Dorleac are
always a pleasure to watch, even when
gibbering; Catherine Deneuve is pretty
but lifeless. As for Belmondo, I’m
afraid the secret of his success still
escapes me.

Ruffling Plumage
Vivienne Binns: Watters Gallery,
Sydney.
Michael Johnson: Central Street Gal-
lery, Sydney.
MISS BINNS has been upsetting
people because she has turned
Watters Gallery into a tenth-rate
phallic temple and a hold-all bin full of
discarded paint-rags, damaged books,
wads of crumpled paper, softened re-
cords, bashed-about paintings, and
hacked-about structures. Under the
stairs she packs a jumble of paper,
wood, records, books, clotlj, and a
teapot, the junk growing up the wall
in a gallery take-over bid.
One of the books in the morass is
Moravia’s “The Empty Canvas,” bored
through the centre; in that tale the
canvas remained blank because of the
artist’s inhibitions. Miss Binns doesn’t
leave much blank, but she endures a
similar desperation: she smashes a sheet
of white masonite and tosses the pieces
together again; a giant rat seems to have
gnawed the edges of a painting of a
flowering phallus; the large wooden
sculpture that occupies the centre of the
floor is like a tumbling heap of car-
penter’s stools and off-cuts, as though
she was intent on destroying Cubism
itself.
When she does construct a semi-
cubist piece she disrupts the effect by
imposing sharply colored art nouveau
curlicues; her grandiose collages with
books and records involve a similar
destructive impulse; one burned set of
books hanging from the rafter -recalls
John Latham’s volumes embedded in
varied surfaces, but his carry the feel-
ing of inevitable destruction; Miss
Binns’ of wilful vandalism.
However, Miss Binns is fragmented
within herself, and against the Aberfan
avalanche some sexual forms stand
more or less firmly. When she calls
works “Phallic Monument,” “Vag Hens”
—done in Horrid Fairground Color —
and draws a “Sacred Bosom Tree” with
pendant babies’ dummies for nipples,

“B' ’
she is inviting varied interpretations of
her more innocuous work. She has, for
example, two black slabs angled at
thirty degrees, the insides a mass of
tacky paint. Called “Ecclesiastic,’ it
suggests that the dogma of religion and
lush abstraction can be equally messy.
What distresses people most is a purple,
nylon bun-net bang in the middle of an
unpleasantly shiny abstract. A simple
mechanism makes it suck and palpi-
tate; its ambiguity affronts masculinity
by its challenge, makes females feel
inadequate, but would excite any
marine biologist into thinking he had
found a purple sea anemone breathing
on dry land.
Of course Miss Binns is just part of
the erotic movement (Cop Art,
Analytic Pubism, Pathetic Phalluses,
etc.) leering over countless horizons,
though “leering” is misleading because
most of it is cool, detached, and
prosaic, and little of it has Miss Binns’
occasional tendency toward Freudian
symbolism. I should imagine that lots
of people object to such work because,
like the Victorians, they expect art to
ennoble, edify, educate, and provoke
guiltless pleasure. It is clear enough
that if art no longer holds the mirror
up to nature it may so hold it up to
viewers to arouse disgust and ruffle
the gallery-goer’s plumage.
If the terms were not so suspect one
might like to call a lot of it empty and
boring; she does, however, have several
pieces that do quicken the imagination:
a discarded, dirty plank hung with
bottle tops and sprouting horrid hair
a real fetishistic antidote to bland
hard-edgers like Michael Johnson- —
and two hanging bas reliefs of rough,
colored wood that look back to Arp
over the alps of debris.
JOHNSON, an Australian in London,
looks at Arp, too, and at Ellsworth
Kelly in a set of hard-edged works that
could be called puritanical if that term
did not imply repression as well as
dedication, for Johnson has no hidden
psychological pressures and few spatial
ones. His is an English version a
little delicate and polite of hard-
edged painting. “Slow Lap,” very like
Arp, is limp; areas in two large, uni-
formly painted works simply drift away.
When he imposes a broad blue “K” on
black to set up a sharp encounter be-
tween form and color or floats a green
egg-shape over white in “December”
(108 x 74 inches) he appears more
committed, but even the latter looks as
if knightly heraldry has been replaced
by feminine decor.
This genteel ease may be preferred
to Miss Binns’ rampant forms and
clutter of debris; but there is surely a
way between aggressive and desperate
defiance and Johnson’s neutrality: I
certainly saw it a fortnight ago in
Perth, not in painting but in architec-
ture, with Ron Ferguson’s almost com-
pleted Law School for the University
of Western Australia tough, tender,
solid and formidable, poised, and re-
ticent.

BOOKS
Moravia in Rome
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Lie. Alberto Moravia. Seeker and
Warburg. $3.85.
WITH “The Lie,” Alberto Mora-
via has added yet another
dimension to his work. The mix-
ture itself is admittedly the same: the
Roman setting, the ladies of the “mai-
sons de rendezvous,” an unsatisfactory
marriage, the inevitable first-person
narrative, and death as a handy deus
ex machina. But what really matters
is the way he has put this good old hot-
blooded Frascati into a new shape of
bottle, yet with his own distinctive
label clearly recognisable.
To make sense of Moravia’s Rome
one must continue to do, and think,
as the Romans do: some of the marital
situations which seem to be taken for
granted could only be tolerated in a
city where divorce is not commonly
practised. (To name only one anomaly,
the mother of an illegitimate child, if
married and living apart from her hus-
band, has no claim on her own off-
spring.) And where else could one
accept unquestioningly the fact that a
highly respected newspaperman, even
one whose job takes him frequently
away from home, could live in the
same house as his estranged wife, Cora,
and her illegitimate daughter, Baba,
rarely see them, never take meals with
them, and remain unaware that his
wife runs a brothel until he receives
an anonymous letter, and then turn
a blind eye to the whole proceedings?
Add to this the extra ingredient of
an “incestuous” attachment for the
strange stepdaughter, plus Cora’s offer-
ing of the girl, at that time aged 14,
to her husband in order to enjoy a
relationship by proxy and there is
sufficient interplay of human emotions
to engage the reader. Whereas an
earlier novel like “A Ghost at Noon ’
takes as its “raison d’etre” the explora-
tion of another type of marital
estrangement, this in “The Lie” is
only the starting point.
The story is told in time-worn diary
form, but unconventionally hovering
between recorded fact and embroidered
fiction. This device purposely so con-
fuses the reader that he is never sure
which is truth until the end, and even
then there is a deliberate aftertaste
of doubt left to linger in the mind.
By this method, Moravia, is revealing
the ambiguity of truth, and pointing
up the honest bias that lies beneath
every one of our apparently simple
actions. Uncompromisingly, he shows
the self-delusion with which we pad
our consciences, the manner in which
we justify ourselves in front of our
own self-judgment, by those interior
dialogues that we call “thinking it
out.”
But with all this we have still not
yet come to the last and most import-
ant of Moravia’s revelations: to hammer
out the essence of creative authorship;
the husband is keeping the diary
ostensibly in order later to write a
novel about his own attempted non-
involvement with his family. This is
to be a new type of novel, without
drama or the customary situations. (In
other words, a “New Novel,” though
the term is not used.) It will deal with
the theme of non-involvement, which
is already in itself an involvement.
Moravia now shows how a writer
transforms his own experiences into
the written page. He records the same
episodes in different ways (1) as they
did happen, (2) as he would prefer
to imagine them to have happened
basically factual but with the flattering
embellishments of the truth as he sees
it for the sake of making them into a
good book, or (3) in the cloudy world
of dreams as he would like them to
happen.
“The Lie’s” wish-dreams gather
momentum, revolving more and more
about the stepdaughter who wants a
father but woos him like a lover, his
desire heightened rather than held in
check by the idea of “incest.” He des-
cribes their love-making in detail
but later admits it had all occurred
only in his mind. Corruption, he
decides, is the normal, “something
natural, biological, perhaps necessary,
anyhow inevitable.” The basic treat-
ment is in places not unlike Robbe-
Grillet’s “The Erasers,” even including
an extraordinary analogy with “Oedi-
pus.” But it is certainly not at all
an imitation: it is only on the same
wave-length; a masterpiece standing
firmly on its own feet.
Again, as in previous Moravias, the
translation by Angus Davidson is first-
rate, except for one small slip with
feminine underwear, which reads un-
intentionally, no doubt, like those Vic-
torian references to breasts as neck.
Unfortunately, the book’s Italian title,
“L’Attenzione,” with all its multiple
inferences is unusable in its literal
English translation, and “The Lie,”
though striking, is not as attention-
arousing as the original. The lie stands
for the truth that cannot be achieved.
Monotonous Monsarrat
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Life is a Four Letter Word. Nicholas
Monsarrat. Cassell. $5.80.
MR. MONSARRAT’S autobiog-
raphy is divided into six sec-
tions and deals with his life
from one to 26. Between each section
there is a gap of five years. The
autobiography, therefore, begins with
Nicholas Monsarrat
reflections on the nursery which are
enlivened by notable passages such as:
“There was a crooked man who walked
a crooked mile. Cock-a-doodle-doo,
one dame had lost her shoe, while a
second, older woman lived in another
one, with all those children. Four-and-
twenty blackbirds were baked in a pie.
My bonnie lay over the ocean. A
mouse ran up the clock. The little dog
laughed to see such fun. There was
even a man in the moon!”
These periodic fillers recur through
the narrative with long lists of the
events, books, and tunes of each period
which the autobiography covers. The
method recalls Wilfred Thomas radio
shows, but Wilfred Thomas is able to
enliven such commentaries with the
charm of his voice and musical inter-
ludes, the total effect of which is often
quite magical. Here, however, we have
to wade through the dull porridge of
Monsarrat’s prose, and the net result
has about as much interest as a list of
cricket scores.
Monsarrat was the son of a highly
successful Liverpool surgeon, and in
the earlier part of the book he des-
cribes his childhood during World War
I, summer holidays at a Welsh fishing
resort, brutal governesses, the vicious
system which was in operation at Win-
chester when he was student there, the
coming of puberty, and the elaborate
dances organised by Liverpool’s upper


bourgeoisie for their children. The
mood is nostalgia for the past and
anger at the injustices of the past.
In the section entitled “Exit the
Double-Breasted Funster,” Monsarrat
then moves to his student days at Cam-
bridge, where he enacted a lotus-eater’s
existence, living beyond his means,
associating with a hedonistic set of
young upper-class men who wined,
dined, and bantered with each other,
went out with debutantes and regarded
socialism as a dirty word. This was in
1931 and Monsarrat, at the age of
twenty, had still not responded to the
moods of the time. He describes in
some detail the running of the yachting
club at Trearddur Bay, and the disputes
between various members of the club
arising from their swearing at each
other during races, and so he goes on
and on. The description of his golden
days at Cambridge has a certain
poignance, but is hardly the stuff of
serious or even interesting literature.
The final section of the book, “Gone
Away!” is set in 1936, by which time
Monsarrat had become a socialist, had
embarked on a writing career, was
living with a girl who helped support
him, and was associating with a group
of artistic Pimlicans. He describes his
reactions to the Spanish Civil War and
a tour of Europe which he made with
his girlfriend on thirty pounds in her
inherited Rolls-Royce. The book con-
cludes with a visit by his girlfriend,
himself, and another young couple to
a French brothel where they watch the
amatory exploits of a couple of lesbians.
The moral of the visit is that sex is
more than a matter of mere techniques
and must involve love and affection.
The book finishes on a note of joy at
being alive.
There are several pre-conditions for
a successful autobiography and none
of them is fulfilled by this book. The
autobiographer may succeed, despite
an unexceptional prose style, because
his life has been important and inter-
esting. The authorship of “The Cruel
Sea” does not make Monsarrat a suf-
ficiently important person to justify an
autobiography of this length. In fact,
his life has very little intrinsic interest.
He is honest enough to make no great
claims to being a thinker, but one is
struck throughout the book by its basic
thinness. Monsarrat’s conversion to
socialism arrives almost as an after-
thought and seems to have been a
response to his social milieu rather than
the product of intensive thought. Mon-
sarrat does not seem to have had any
exceptional friendships or events happen
to him. A warm patina surrounds most
of the people appearing in the narra-
tive, but none of them at any point
steps out of the page and takes hold
of the reader.
The other factor which may have
made this successful autobiography
would have been an exceptionally
charming prose style. The dullness of
Monsarrat’s subject matter is matched
by the dullness of the prose.
The Changeling
You turn into my daughter where we sleep.
One twittering, split-nose mouse snoops out, snoops in.
Together in the separateness we keep
Who might you be that ear, another’s cheek,
An eye, a stretched-blue breast-vein unforgotten?
You turn into my daughter where we sleep
And yet a son’s gums grope the dark to eat
Where my dry muscles clench themselves and harden.
Together in the separateness we keep
You wrench upright and churn my father’s teeth;
A mouse lunge lofts its whale-foam through the moon.
You turn into my daughter where we sleep
As oceans hump up nightward in the street
Where mother’s shadows gather to return
Together in the separateness we keep.
Between the mouse’s thirsty cupboard squeal
And the howling whale’s vast tidal sea decline,
You turn into my daughter where we sleep
Together in the separateness we keep.

Dazzling Colloquies
By R. G. HOWARD
Edith Wharton and Henry James. The
Story of their Friendship. Millicent
Bell. Peter Owen. $4.80.
Relationships between major
literary figures have the fascina-
tion of a glimpse of life on
Olympus. In the imagination we hear
even their lightest conversations as a
playful exchange of thunderbolts; in
reality they are no doubt less awe-
inspiring. But, for once, if we are to
believe Millicent Bell, a literary friend-
ship did have Olympian qualities. In
this book about James and Edith
Wharton we read, wonderstruck, of all
the dazzling colloquies that took place
between the two writers. As one
gathering after another is described
at Mrs. Wharton’s Massachusetts home
(appropriately called “The Mount”),
at her Paris salon in the Rue de
Varenne, or at “Qu-Acre,” the hos-
pitable house of Howard Sturgis in
Windsor as hour upon hour of
golden conversation, witty and pro-
found, with now and then a “glimmer”
of poetry “like a silver light,” unfolds,
one feels almost ready to sacrifice a
whole book by either writer (or one of
Edith Wharton’s, at any rate) for an
hour’s experience of that fabulous talk.
Mrs. Wharton herself apparently
thought James the conversationalist
superior to James the novelist. This is
to say much of the charm and power
of Henry James, if very little for the
literary insight of Edith Wharton. One
can imagine Proust, who roundly con-
demned Saint-Beuve for similar short-
sightedness, turning over in his grave,
except, of course, for the fact that he
was not yet in it at the time. Miss Bell
reminds us that Paris in the early part
of this century was teeming with great
writers, painters, and musicians. All
those possibilities for earth-shaking
“entretiens” cause the mind to boggle,
yet, in fact, regrettably few took place.
One recalls in particular the disastrous
encounter of Proust and Joyce.
There is, however, much to delight us
in Miss Bell’s engrossing account, of the
James-Wharton relationship. Two
phases of it are especially striking.
The middle phase saw Edith Wharton
incessantly and frantically journeying
over the Continent in a chauffeur-driven
car, and rarely missing an opportunity
to pounce on James, trying quietly, not
to say meekly, to get on with his work
in Rye. “Pounce” is James’ own word,
and the period is marked by his bril-
liant letters to various friends, describ-
ing with fascination, mock-alarm, and
some genuine uneasiness his hyper-
kinetic friend’s coming and going. He
liked to refer to her as a Golden Eagle

(with himself a Worm) the “whirr
and wind” of her “great pinions” would
be “cold” on his “foredoomed brow,”
moments later he would be “struggling
in her talons,” and so on. He built up
a “chain of wonderful comic variations
upon the theme of her restless energy
and her shattering intrusion.” Miss Bell
quotes generously from these largely
unpublished letters, but one waits
impatiently for the complete text.
The last phase which took place
during the beginning of World War I
had James (now in his seventies) feel-
ing helpless at home in London, pas-
sionately reading the war news,
including the reports of his younger
and still active friend who was visiting
the front for a series of articles inten-
ded to stir the consciences of her fellow
Americans. Before the war ended James
had died. Mrs. Wharton had not been
at his bedside. It was a quiet, melan-
choly end to a great friendship,
Miss Bell, in the second half of her
book, examines Edith Wharton’s fiction,
and, in particular, makes a definitive
statement about the influence of James
on her work. It was an influence, she
finds, that has been over-estimated, and
where it existed Mrs. Wharton was
always at pains to shake it off. Her
summing-up of the two writers is able,
“Even in Edith Wharton’s best work,”
she writes, there is “a thin and wintry
quality traceable, perhaps, to the in-
adequacy of her attachment to life, the
weakness of her sense of what makes
it valuable.” James, on the other hand,
“really adored life. He could never
cease his passionate absorption in it,
his wonder at new human revelations.”
The Real Rembrandt
By ELWYN LYNN
Rembrandt and the Italian Renaissance.
Kenneth Clark. John Murray. $8.90.
THOSE accustomed to the urbanity
and restrained fervor of Sir Ken-
neth Clark on television and in
his works on Leonardo da Vinci, land-
scape and the nude, may now see him
as the detective-scholar, disputing an
attribution or rectifying an opinion with
the air of bestowing a compliment, as
he discusses Rembrandt’s use of his
Italian sources. He convinces because
he is tolerant, never disputatious, and
can distinguish the large issues from
higgling minutiae. Only when he deals *
with Rembrandt’s early “repulsiveness”
does he sound prim and censorious;
usually he is the unmagisterial, happy
hunter.
The book was delivered as the first
Wrightsman Lectures at New York’s
Metropolitan Museum and arose from
his realisation that Rembrandt’s debt
to Italy was insufficiently appreciated.
Clark goes far beyond a cataloguing of
influences which include Italian Renais-
sance drawings, paintings, prints,
medallions, and illustrated treatises, for
he shows how Rembrandt’s creative pro-
cesses made varied use of the work of
his Italian predecessors.
These Rembrandt could study in
private collections, auction rooms, from
reproductions in the tests of Leonardo’s
“Trattato” and Perrier’s “leones et
Segmenta,” and from his own collec-
tion. Clark prints the 1656 inventory of
Rembrandt’s 363 possessions and fur-
ther research may reveal influences of
the work he actually lived with.
Clark seems too concerned with
In Captivity
I didn’t see the circus,
just the elephants,
seven, joined by trunk and tail,
treading Swan Street.
They plod and idly sway,
vast, like a slack sea
spilling over the tramway,
drowning my being with
“what is, should never be.”
Salt water stings; r
breathing, do I drown,
trunk to tail with fellow man,
burdened by human dignity?
Awash in my neat blue car
I simulate compassion.

direct Italian influence, which could
have come to Rembrandt through
Dutch renditions of Italian classicism,
but Rembrandt was, as Clark points
out, in vigorous revolt against the
veneration of antiquity, the restraint,
economy, and smooth, continuous, un-
interrupted forms of classicism. Rem-
brandt, Clark feels, even overstated
his anti-classicism in his early years
with heavy-bellied women, an unpleas-
ant, genitalia-exhibiting Ganymede and
in “The Blinding of Samson.” In the
last I think Clark overstates his own
case. It is, he says, a horror of revolt-
ing realism, hideous; he compares the
“grotesque” halberdier with a stoker.
What is “disturbing” about this work,
which I’ve seen at Frankfurt, is the
thrusting of the halberd across Sam-
son’s crotch; Rembrandt knew how to
disturb intuitively; in the psycho-
analytic era, Clark should know that
blinding is symbolic castration, and
therein lies the disturbing element.
Rembrandt had a love-hate relation
with Italian art; though he resisted the
baroque, he succumbed to it; he swung
between a love of clarity and order
and a dislike of the purely illustrative.
The famous etching of “Christ Pre-
sented to the People,” of 1655, which,
says Clark, has the grandeur and sim-
plicity of a Raphael or Masaccio, is
done in another version in the same
year with the jostling crowd withdrawn
and a mysterious figure, plucked from
Michelangelo’s . precise architecture,
placed in the foreground against two
openings like “The doors of a Pira-
nesian dungeon.”
QLARK is best in comparing
individual works with their
sources such as the differences
between “The Three Crosses of
1653” and that of 1661 and be-
tween the achievements of Rembrandt
and the Italian masters. Certainly Clark
is correct in describing Titian’s Venus
as a monstrous fruit, a piece of vege-
table inertia topped with an expression-
less head, while Rembrandt’s “Danae”
is warm, responsive, her body sensuously
compelling.
As most of the comparisons are
based on drawings and etchings, little
mention is made of color, though one
chapter is based on Venetian influences.
He is more interested in how the great
colorists draw; “using line to suggest
color, nearly all arrive at a similar
technique, with broken line and free,
light-promoting contours,” and it is
the arrangement or pose of a Titian,
Mantegna, Raphael, or Leonardo that
is discussed rather than the effects of
color.
In a time when influence is equated
(in many quarters) with plagiarism,
it is a salutary work; Clark hopes that
Rembrandt’s genius is not diminished
by his account of influences and chides
those who adore “artless simplicity.”
There are few figures, like Rembrandt
and Shakespeare, who are not dimin-
ished by an account of their formative
influences.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Changing a Quid
IT is an absurd and inefficient method of counting, but
the Decimal Currency Board must be congratulated for
introducing the decimal system so successfully. After
only a year of the new currency, three-quarters of the busi-
ness machines and most financial transactions are now in
decimals. And the changeover has been so smooth that the
dual currency system, with all its scope for confusion, is to
be cut by six months, so that £ s. d. will no longer be
acceptable (except in some special circumstances) after
August 1 this year.
But the Decimal Currency Board’s success, under its
energetic leader, Sir Walter Scott, should not obscure the
problems that still have to be solved in this move out of
pounds and into decimals. No system of counting in 10s
can be regarded as anywhere near perfect when people still
make the bulk of their purchases in dozens, weigh things in
avoirdupois, and think in £ s. d. And speeding up the con-
version period will do little to solve the first two of these
problems. Until they are solved, the decimal system will
have provided only a part of the limited benefits its propa-
gators have claimed for it. So the Decimal Currency Board
will not have finished its job by August 1 by any means,
even if almost all machines are converted to decimals and
if £ s. d. notes and coins have all but disappeared. The next
part of its job should be regarded as just as important as
the purely technical work it has done in spreading the
message (and the mechanics) of decimal conversion. Now
it must work toward decimal packaging and decimal weights.
This would be a far better use of the Board’s energies than
in trying to find ways of killing the quid, which seems to be
taking up an unnecessary amount of its time. For while
there is no question that the conversion has been a technical
success, there are strong doubts that it will remove the pound
from the public place. The Board is privately worried about
the pound, despite its public confidence. The Board’s stated
assurances about the likely disappearance of the pound from
advertising after August 1 (particularly of houses, cars, and
electrical appliances) seem quite unrealistic. There is no
reason in the world why a quid should cease to exist; there
will still be a quid note, even if it does have two dollars
written on it. And if the guinea could survive in advertising
for 150 years after there was no such coin, there seems every
prospect of the pound, which will continue to exist under
another name, remaining in business.
The Board’s suggestion that public impatience with adver-
tising in £s will stop the practice that is so prevalent now
on “big ticket items” seems little better than wishful think-
ing; businessmen like Sir Maurice Nathan, of Patersons, the
Melbourne furnishing store, whose business suffered through
changing to dollar advertising (it looks twice as dear) will
need a lot of convincing that “it is in the business community’s
best interests” to advertise in decimals. It looks like becom-
ing an accepted convention for some items to be advertised
in pounds (even though the bill must be paid in dollars).
The Board has more important things to do than fuss* about
this sort of thing. For it must make the decimal system
as efficient as possible to make up the severe disadvantages
that come with its introduction; disadvantages that could
have been avoided by a more sensible form of counting.
All the benefits of decimals (the ease of multiplication
and so on by messing about with noughts and decimal.
MEN AND MATTERS
ON the view that the more ex-
perience of company finance new
members of the stock exchanges
can bring with them into the business
the better, Mr. R. F. Morgan’s election
to the Melbourne Exchange last week is
to be commended, even if he has been
let in by the front door, as it were,
without a stockbroking apprenticeship.
Number 26 of the rules and regu-
lations of the Exchange lays strict mini-
mum requirements for candidates
aspiring to membership. The general
run of people must have spent four
years in the profession. Those with
experience in accountancy, banking,
finance, financial journalism and so
forth can qualify after only one year
in it. In special cases, however, the
committee has a discretionary power to
waive the qualifying periods. This
is what it has done for Mr. Morgan.
With a degree in commerce obtained
after the war, following four years in
the Silent Service, subsequent exten-
sive experience in mining and indus-
trial finance (Western Mining and
Alcoa of Australia) and a lot of untiring
community service to his credit, Mr.
Morgan seems to have won a rarely
exercised waiver from the committee
with ease, to become the newest of
the Exchange’s members (eight mem-
bers have been elected in the last year).
Being an Old Boy of Carey Grammar,
whose stars shine
almost as brightly
around the city
as Melbourne
Grammar’s these
days, would cer-
tainly not have
dimmed the can-
didate’s chances.
With two old
hands, Mr. H. G.
Tredinnik and
Mr. D. S. Rogers
(who for years
was the chief
executive officer of the Stock
Exchange), to hold his hand in the
firm of Edward Ward and Co. which
he is joining, Mr. Morgan will doubt-
less speedily get the hang of things in
his new sphere.
FORMER Oxford athletics blue
and Eighth Army GSO Lord
Byers has now left for the more
temperate climes of Britain after a
whirlwind visit to CRA’s rapidly
expanding and prosperous works here.
In his fortnight’s stay, this youthful-
looking life peer of 51, who is chair-
man of the British Liberal Party (and
thinks it still has a bright future des-
pite recent turbulence in its ranks),
was set a befittingly hot pace by the
local mining fraternity.
From his university days' Frank
Lord Byers
D. S. Rogers
F. R. Morgan
Byers has shown himself as essentially
a political animal and one who, in
the early postwar period, together with
Jo Grimond and a handful of devotees,
succeeded from a puny headquarters
in the back streets of Westminster in
igniting a spark in the once great
Liberal Party. He was tossed from the
parliamentary ring itself in 1950 by
an unfortunate electoral mischance
(his seat vanished in a redistribution).
Byers found some solace in extra-
parliamentary offices in the Party, but
he turned to the mining realm of Rio
Tinto for hard cash. Before the mighty
Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation was joined
in 1962, he was, inter alia, a director
of the Rio Tinto Mining Company of
Australia. On the merger he became
an executive director of Rio Tinto-
Zinc.


points) could have been obtained within the far more
practical dozen system simply by changing the appearance
of a couple of numerals. After going up to nine in the
normal way, two extra numerals could have been inserted
(say 8 and 9 to represent the old 10 and 11) and the old 12
could then have been changed into a number called 10 but
made up of 12 units. So instead of the ridiculous basic
unit of 10 we now have, which is divisible only by 2 and 5,
we would have had a unit that could be halved, quartered,
and split into thirds and sixths. So one dozen would be
written as 10; a dozen dozen, the old gross (or 144), would
become 100 (the old 100 would become 84).
Had this been done, our currency would then have matched
not only our habit of buying things in dozens, but also such
other factors as the months in the year and the hours on
the face of a clock. The old coins need not have been
changed; the only new needs would have been one dollar
notes (equal to 12/- under the old system) and suitable
varieties of other notes. Of course we couldn’t have done
it this way; it would have been out of step with 95 percent
of the world. But in terms of efficiency and good sense,
95 percent of the world is wrong.
The Bullet for Daisy
DAISY should be shot. This is not only because of the
claptrap she is mooing in butter’s battle with mar-
garine, but also because, in terms of cash, New Zealand
cows moo more sense.
At a time when N.Z. is in serious economic difficulties
because of her export failures (the tough internal restraints
imposed at the weekend a,re certain to be followed by further
unpleasant measures when Parliament resumes), the Aus-
tralian dairy industry should not be standing in the way of
increased New Zealand exports to Australia; the New
Zealand dairy industry is far more efficient than its Aus-
tralian counterpart, largely because of the butter-fat yields
from New Zealand’s lush pastures. There are few things
that the New Zealanders can do better than us, but produc-
ing milk is one of them. Their butter costs 34 cents a lb.
in the shops—and that is without any subsidy; ours costs 52
cents after a whacking great one.
If New Zealand is to be a viable market for Australian
manufactures, it must be given the opportunity of selling its
products overseas —and Australia is one of the few reason-
able markets for the products that, foolishly enough, New
Zealand still concentrates on for its export income. Shoot-
ing Daisy (and all the Australian milker cows put out of
work by New Zealand dairy imports) would leave a large
area of good pasture land free for beef-cattle fattening.
And this is the sort of grazing we should be concentrating
on as demand for proteins increases among the affluent
countries of the world which can afford to spend money
on importing meat
This is also a moral for New Zealand. The ridiculous
basic assumptions that everything would go on as before
(and markets could be found for all produce) when New
Zealand set out its eight-year agricultural production targets
in 1964 are indefensible in a situation where New Zealand
already had a warning that the whole structure of its agri-
cultural exports could well be disrupted if Britain went into
the Common Market, or if synthetics continued to assault
the wool trade. The New Zealanders failed to recognise the
need for a structural change in the agricultural industry
toward beef production, a move that has certainly been
understood here.
It is astounding that the New Zealanders have, in fact,
moved the other way; in the four years from 1962 to 1966,
the number of sheep in N.Z. has jumped by 17 percent
while beef cattle numbers have risen by only 10 percent.
So there are now 15 times as many sheep in N.Z. as beef
cattle (reckoned as ewe equivalents), and the major reason
for the country’s present problems is a severe fall in the
price of its wool. It is true that the Australia-New Zealand
trade agreement ought to mean more in practical terms to
N.Z. But if they claim we should put our dairy house in
order, they should have a good look at their own sadly
misdirected agricultural policy.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy: The Bank of New South Wales
believes “the Aystralian economy entered 1967 in a
state of remarkable balance.” It is willing to confess that
this situation seems “highly unsatisfying” to advocates
of growth. “In the "final quarter of 1966 distinct signs
of increased activity were evident but they have yet to
emerge as a general upward movement,” the bank adds.
January’s exports climbed to a record $260.4 million
yet $284 million of imports meant an adverse
trade balance of $23.6 million.
At peak levels for a January, new overdraft lending
by the trading banks averaged $23.1 million a week,
although limits dropped back $21.3 million from
December’s $4293.3 million.
For the markets! Most industrial sections on
Australian share markets have effected a gentle retreat;
interim reports are furnishing the individual kicks, up
and down. Mining issues appear distinctly weaker.
In London, industrials as a whole look very irregular,
yet quite a few leaders are managing to creep ahead . . .
A late Friday buying surge allowed Wall Street to end
reasonably firm.
For companies: Tumbled from a lofty perch,
Rothmans of Pall Mall (Aust) had to disclose a
$1,863,039 profit slide in the December half-year, when
pre-tax earnings totalled only $1,022,458; in consequence,
the interiry dividend came down from 10 to 6 percent.
“The board is satisfied that what is being done is setting
a firm foundation for renewed growth in sales volume
and profits” . . . Edging forward again, another big ’un,
Felt and Textiles, brought a half-year’s profit up from
$904,816 to $1,005,163 on steady sales; tax losses
helped . . . On top for ages, Australian Guarantee Cor-
poration offers a gleefully accepted l-for-7 bonus issue
which will involve 5,928,570 50-cent shares.
The week was full of Hamersley Iron Pty., whose
public issue may come later in February. The group is
trying to sell much larger quantities of ore and pellets
to Japan and capped the news by revealing a $553,348
profit for 1966—achieved in five months’ operations . . >
In contrast, the Mount Newman partners are delaying
the submission of their construction plans by a further
three months, to May 7.
Among other miners, King Island Scheelite’s new ore
body is “encouraging but still inconclusive. . . ” Beach-
sands leader Associated Minerals has jumped its interim
from 16 to 20 percent and predicts a full year’s result
“well in excess” of 1965-66 . . . Western Titanium has
also lifted both output and the half-year’s sales . . . On
the oil side, Woodside may drill only one Gippsland
offshore well.
Finance Corporation of Australia kept in the swim
with December period’s earnings up by 20 percent to
$689,014 and showing an 18.1 percent yearly earning
rate . . . All departments of Commercial Union Assur-
ance are improving . . . Likewise, Ipec Insurance is
reaching toward a record year.
Companies close to building still look somewhat vari-
able . . . ARC Industries has been able to lift sales
slightly, yet these yielded smaller profit; the divi-
dend is in no danger ... On steady sales, pipe-maker
Rocla advanced earnings by 10 percent; orders are sub-
stantially better . . . Overseas Corporation anticipates
a bright and record year; interim payment goes from
five to six percent . . . Builders’ supplier Swans cuts
the interim heavily from five to 2 percent on decreased
sales and profits . . . Sales of Danks’ hardware moved
up; profits edged down on higher costs.

Lord Casey's Stock Book
By CROESUS
LORD CASEY’S account of the lives
of his grandfather (C.G.C.) and
father (R.G.C.) in “Australian
Father and Son” (Collins) hardly hits
the literary heights as a biography and
has been roughly treated by some re-
viewers, particularly in London, where
“Punch” for one was most half-Kearted
about it. For all that, it shouldn’t be
dismissed lightly as a scrappy patch-
work affair where the threads are
loosely woven arid in which the author
brandishes his own thoughts on the
modern world in profusion. Most of
the scraps are appetising and it is very
interesting, at least to Australians, to
learn what stuff their locally born and
bred Governor-General is made from
and as such what he thinks about affairs
in general.
My concern here is only to pick up
some of the economic threads scattered
over the book as reflecting on topics of
current interest. In doing this I leave
aside the grandfather, Dr. Cornelias
Gavin Casey, who was born of Irish
parents at Liverpool (U.K.) in 1911
and came to Australia on spec in 1833,
to serve soon after his arrival as sur-
geon and magistrate at the penal settle-
ment of Port Arthur. My focus is on
the pastoral and mining adventures of
the father, Richard Gavin Casey, who
was born in Tasmania in 1846 and died
on his way back from London in 1919.
In these experiences we find a number
of clues to the present Governor-Gen-
eral’s intense interest in the CSIRO.
They also throw new light on the pro-
cess of fertilisation of Australia’s in-
dustrial growth through the medium of
the discovery and exploitation of min-
eral resources.
'J'HE father (R.G.C.) went through
the whole gamut of pastoral life in
Australia over a period of thirty years
from 1863, when he went to Murray
Downs station as a jackaroo at the age
of 17. He managed stations for a salary
in N.S.W., Victoria, and Queensland.
For a short time he was also a real-
estate agent in Victoria. But his most
intense pastoral experience was in the
ten years to 1893, when, as chief man-
ager and partner (with Wallace) of
three Queensland stations (Terrick,
Kilcummin, and Normanby). “As his
diaries record,” says the author, “R.G.C.
had gone to Queensland in 1883 with
high hopes ... he ended his ten years
there with a heavy heart at the wasted
years,” the main blights to his experi-
ence being drought, high interest rates,
and falling wool prices (between 1883
and 1893 wool prices fell from 12d to
7d a pound, every penny drop meaning
a loss to the partnership of £10,000).
In writing up these experiences from
his father’s records, Lord Casey, who
was born in 1890 in the thick of them,
shows he probably learned something
about them firsthand from his father
in later years (though the two were
never very close, it seems). Anyway, as
his work on CSIRO affairs and his
sure touch on such matters in the book
attests, Lord Casey has had a more
abiding interest in wool-growing than
his father, who appears to have been
completely disillusioned on the subject.
A poorer but wiser man, in 1893 R.G.C.
quit growing wool for good. With a
wealth of business experience, but only
scanty savings acquired in the process,
he departed for Melbourne to interest
himself mainly in mining and finance,
in which he was to do very much
better, leaving his son to indulge him-
self in the intriguing but only vaguely
relevant excursions into wool econ-
omics, which we find in this book.
While working the vast properties in
the country back of Rockhampton, and
as State Member of Parliament for
Warrego from 1888 to 1893, R.G.C. had
become a considerable figure in those
parts. He was not in on the original
bonanza of the rich gold discovery at
Mt. Morgan in 1882 because he only
arrived in the region a year later, but
he subsequently became very close tc
the partners, particularly the two Hall
brothers and William Knox D’Arcy, and
acquired a small financial interest in the
mine (Lord Casey recounts that R.G.C.
sold his shares on his wedding day in
1888). These acquaintances in the
mining world were to play a consider-
able part in R.G.C.’s later life, but
not just yet, because the goldrush was
on in Western Australia when he left
Queensland, and R.G.C. made tracks
there soon after his arrival in Mel-
bourne from the north.
Lord Casey’s book never lacks color,
which comes through both in the text
and pictures (we see R.G.C. riding on a
camel at the ill-fated Londonderry mine
at Coolgardie and, for good measure,
a real English lord playing some part
in the financing is riding alongside, not
all that comfortably, according to the
text). The W.A. goldfields seem to
have been a transitional experience, a
sort of breathing space, while R.G.C.’s
interests in the financial world thick-
ened largely on the basis of his Mt.
Morgan connections, which appear to
have embraced him more heartily than
ever from about the mid-1890s. Even
then, as his son relates, he' had only
slender financial resources.
At this stage we begin to link -closer
with the modern company world and
the influence of Melbourne financial
circles in Australia-wide industrial and
rural development. First we find R.G.C.
interesting his Mt. Morgan friends in
investing in Goldsbrough Mort, whose
shares are cheap and whose affairs need
refurbishing. This proves successful for
all concerned, though not without
troubles, because the recovery from
Melbourne’s financial crisis in mid-
-1893 was slow and London’s “Punch”
was saying “Advance Australia, noth-
ing.” By 1899 R.G.C. is vice-chairman
of Mort’s, and by 1912 chairman,
roughly the same progression he enjoyed
in the hierarchy of Mt. Morgan.
If Lord Casey doesn’t give us any
new material about Mt. Morgan, in
relating his father’s association with the
company he makes many aspects much
clearer, especially on the disposition of
the enormous profits made from the
mine in its early days and the influence
this wealth had on the extension of
industry. R.G.C. seems to have been
the main pilot leading these golden
ships to their ports. Take, for instance,
the industrial offshoots of Mt. Morgan.
The first of these was the Electrolytic
Refining and Smelting Company at
Port Kembla, which was formed in 1907
by Mt. Morgan and other Australian
copper producers (the plant was
finished in good time for World War I).
R.G.C. became chairman of that com-
pany in 1912 (his golden year for
chairmanships).
S°° N . to follow was Australian
Fertilisers, at the same place,
under the same auspices, to use sul-
phuric acid surplus to the refining com-
pany’s requirement, then, one thing
leading to another, as Lord Casey puts
it, Metal Manufactures Ltd. was set up
beside the refining plant to process the
refined copper into commercially usable
forms. The Australian industrial com-
plex, largely based on outworkings of
the big mines, was taking shape.
Although Lord Casey doesn’t push
the point home, his father had obviously
become a man of enormous stature in
Australian finance and industrial circles
and he would seem to deserve deeper
treatment by some biographer. For
instance, we hear little from the author
on what he was doing in London dur-
ing the years of World War I and his
part in marshalling additional finance
for D’Arcy to proceed (mainly with his
profits from Mount Morgan) with his
oil exploration in Persia, which led on
to the formation of the now B.P.
Petroleum Company, is dealt with
only cursorily. We do learn, however,
from this book something of R.G.C.’s
part in the disposal of the estate of one
of the other original partners in Mount
Morgan, W. R. Hall.
Lord Casey explains: “When W. R.
Hall died in Sydney in 1911, he left
the whole of his large estate to his
widow, Eliza, who was childless, and
stipulated in his will that R.G.C. be re-
quested to be the executor of his
estate. R.G.C. accepted the request on
two conditions that his widow dis-
tribute £1 million among her late hus-
band’s relatives throughout Australia
and her own relatives throughout Aus-
tralia, and that she agree to create a
trust for the general benefit of the Aus-
tralian community with an endowment
of £1 million, so that the 'Walter and
Eliza Hall Trust came into existence,
which has been of considerable benefit
to Australia ever since.”

By JASON in Sydney
UNEXPECTEDLY good as the
Hamersley Iron half-year profit
figure of $553,348 undoubtedly
was (after only five months ore ex-
ports, to give a profit margin of 74
cents a ton), the stockmarket expects
a far larger rate of return per ton than
that from the W.A. deposits when
things settle down. As far as the mar-
ket is concerned, the implications for
Hamersley of such a profit rate mainly
relate to the prospective float this year
of a part interest to the Australian
public. And the 1967 export projection
of 4.2 million tons would suggest a
profit of only $3 million a year at
the profit margin revealed (in a period
of high depreciation and no tax) to
last December. Hamersley should be
able at least to double this. For the
monthly export volume in 1966 averaged
150,000 tons from the first shipment
in August; in 1967 it should average
more than 350,000 tons a month, or
more than double the rate while over-
heads remain constant.
But even if the profit per ton is
double (or even treble) the rate so
far set by Hamersley, it adds weight
to the argument presented here last
December that the market seems to
be taking too bullish a view of Con-
solidated Gold Fields. This line of
argument was pressed here when the
capitalisation of shares in Gold Fields’
listed subsidiary or associate companies
indicated that the market was placing
a value of $32 million on its $lB mil-
lion one third stake in the Mt. Golds-
worthy iron ore development (plus
some additional exploratory work of its
own). This gave a per share capitalisa-
tion of more than $1.50 in iron ore
alone (at current prices for Gold Fields
of around the $4.25 level), compared
with our estimate that Mt. Golds-
worthy was probably worth only 50
cents a share to Gold Fields at present
—unless it wins more contracts,
Gold Fields is entitled to one third
of the profits from mining and ex-
porting million tons of ore in the
current contract (over which time it
would presumably recover its costs so
that any further contracts would be
mainly “cream”). It would need a
net profit per ton of ore of around $2
to bring in even 50 cents a share on
the 22 million $1 Gold Fields shares
Add to this the impact of a possible
outbreak of peace in Vietnam on com-
modity prices (particularly copper) and
the development of the Sierra Leone
rutile deposits, and it seems that not
even the astounding improvements in
the Mt. Lyell production picture seem
to justify current high price of Gold
Fields shares. The stock is good; but
not all that good.
DESPITE the gloomy predictions
of the Chartist late last month on
the likely direction of share prices
for Grace Bros., there seems every pros-
pect that next month the company will
once again surprise the market with a
very good interim report for the six
months to January. Since London
selling knocked the Grace Bros, market
last year, it has shown a tentative re-
covery into the $ 1.70 s before lapsing
back to the $1.60 mark. With con-
sumer spending now appearing to
recover, and with the special problems
of decimal currency and the opening
of Roselands now well behind it, the
company should be in a strong posi-
tion.
ON the face of it things look far
better at Felt and Textiles follow-
ing last Friday’s interim report,
with its 11 percent net profit rise,
steady interim dividend and the
promise of substantial payroll tax re-
bates yet to come. But there is still
every reason for caution with this stock.
Felts’ directors have certainly put on
a brave front in holding the interim
dividend at 5 percent to indicate a
repetition of 10 percent for the year.
The same day they were announcing
their $lOO,OOO half-year net profit rise
(but only after a $97,000 cut in tax),
the New Zealand Prime Minister
began his campaign to quieten down
the tempo of the N.Z. economy.
The market seems to have been
influenced more by directors’ confident
payout than by Mr. Holyoake’s big
stick; the shares jumped from below
par to 55 cents after Friday’s announce-
ment. Yet the company is still clearly
depending heavily on N.Z. earnings;
although its half-year profit of $1
million (compared with the full
1965-66 result of $1.6 million, as the
second half of that financial year
The Chartist says:
LONGREACH OIL LTD. is showing promise of spectacular gains for investors
holding this stock. A strong rise to a high point of 30c was recorded in
1966 after the break in the downtrend, followed by a subsequent reaction
back to 18c toward the end of the year. Prices have already moved up to 33c
on very heavy volume during the current week and, although the possibility
of a reaction back to the intermediate trendline at 28c exists, a short-term
objective of about 42c is indicated, where there would be resistance selling from
the high point of 1962. The overall base consolidation suggests a longer-term
target of between 75c and 80c. Last sale price on 7/2/67 —31 c.

brought serious problems) followed a
“general improvement in divisional
results other than the wool section,” the
fact remains that the only reason sales
remained steady in the latest half-year
at $4B million was that N.Z. sales rose
sufficiently to offset a 6.5 percent drop
in Australian turnover. And this was
despite the difficult times that could
have hit its N.Z. wool operations.
So far this year, then, it appears that
the 57 percent-owned N.Z. subsidiary
is contributing even more to the group’s
result than it did in 1965-66, when it
earned a pre-tax profit half as big again
as the Australian parent company and
provided almost half the net profit
attributable to the group —with its pro-
portion trebling in the past three years.
True, the Australian operations will
have the benefit of retrospective pay-
roll tax reductions of $350,000 this
year, following a favorable Taxation
Board of Review judgment, and these
have not been included in the half-
year results, although they will for the
full year. So, even if the N.Z. subsi-
diary does suffer in the second half
from tougher times for the economy,
the group may be able to get through
with its dividend unscathed. But it
may well need these payroll tax re-
bates to do so. Unless the company
can show fairly soon that it can make
enough profit out of current trading
(without relying on rebates or tax
losses) to meet its dividends, then
investors who pay much more than par
are taking quite a risk.
THE stockmarket got out of the dis-
astrous Tasmanian fires fairly
well. Few public companies were
seriously affected, and insurance will
cover much of their losses. Apart from
the destruction of the Cascade Brewery
and some serious damage at Australian
Newsprint Mills, the fires missed the
major public company manufacturing
plants in the Hobart area. And Cas-
cade has the double protection of an
insurance policy which includes a loss
of profits clause as well as another
plant at Launceston (where it makes
Boag’s beer) that should go a long way
toward meeting demand. The only
other major factory destroyed was the
British-owned Australian Common-
wealth Carbide Co.
There were substantial losses at Aus-
tralian Newsprint Mills, with the most
serious damage being the total destruc-
tion of some stores buildings, log stocks,
and the barking deck, and most of the
stores of kraft pulp. These would
account for a sizable proportion of the
$1.9 million in stocks shown in last
year’s balance sheet, although news-
print stocks themselves, which are also
a big stock item, were not affected.
Most of the installations destroyed
appear to be very recent additions. But
things could have been much worse;
the main production buildings were
saved and are back at work after only
a 10-hour shutdown and by the week>
end there were no serious fires in the
company’s forests.
Luckily, the large plant of Silk and
Textile Printers at Glenorchie was un-
touched and so was the neighboring
plant of Fibre Containers Ltd. No
others suffered any serious losses of
plant or property, although many com-
panies that depended on rural produce
for their profits (like Henry Jones and
Fibre Containers) may find difficulty
with supplies, particularly from the
TN a new book “The Controllers”
(Cheshire: $2.95), published this
week, Hilda Rolfe, economist at the
United Farmers and Woolgrowers’
Association of N.S.W., focuses attention
on a very big question. Is the system of
interlocking directorates which she
surveys in the book, with its network of
intercorporate shareholdings and price
and production agreements, really the
most efficient way of organising the
strategic areas of the Australian
economy? The author stops short of an
answer but has marshalled a wealth of
new material for its consideration.
Limitations of space preclude an
examination of it in this issue but we
will return to it in the near future.
Professor Russell Mathews’ keenly
awaited study “Public Investment in
Australia” ($14.50) by CEDA also
appeared under the Cheshire label this
week, regrettably too late for a full
review before this week’s Federal-States
conference in Canberra, to which it is
directly relevant.
Huon Valley. There are still doubts
about the apple crop, despite assurances
otherwise, and the hop crop could be
damaged.
Although some insurance companies
will clearly face sizable payouts (esti-
mates of the total insurance bill run to
as high as $lO million), these should
have only a modest impact on insur-
ance company profits, as the burden
appears to have been well spread around
the world in reinsurance arrangements.
So this also means that there will be
no sudden large-scale disposals of shares
by insurance companies that have sud-
denly to find funds; few, if any, local
companies would face payouts larger
than five. figures and this sort of cash
would either be readily available or
else could come from disposals of bonds
or other official securities (presumably
at a profit in view of recent interest
rate moves).
THE evidence that things are getting
better in the packaging industry
continues to mount. The merits
of the fibre container and canning sec-
tions of this business have been stated
repeatedly in these pages in the past
eight months or so, after share prices
for some of the more interesting com-
panies appeared to have reached “bot-
tom” following a fall from their 1964
peaks. And as economic recovery con-
tinues to make headway, the prospects
of substantial improvement this year
are becoming stronger.
Last week’s news of higher sales and
profits from Containers Ltd., the Mel-
bourne-based can, fibre, and other con-
tainer maker, not only confirms the
general trend but also underlines the
success this company has had with its
own reorganisation in the past year or

so, a success which was confidently ex-
pected here. And with prospects for
the second half of the financial year
forecast by directors as “most promis-
ing” following the 10 percent first half
rise in sales (accompanied by an even
greater rise in pre-tax profit), the com-
pany should face a much more reward-
ing future than the market has given
it credit for.
For it seems unlikely that, in the
six months to December, the company
would have received anything like its
potential profit benefits from the new
can-making plant opened last year at
Dandenong (mainly to supply the
Heinz plant as Heinz sold out its can-
making activities to Containers). So
this should be a continuing source of
improvement. So, too, should the re-
latively small but increasingly successful
greeting-card division, where energetic
management has turned a loss opera-
tion into a growing profit-earner.
There still seem to be some problems
in Container’s paper, plastics, and
“flexible packaging” operations, but the
buoyant conditions for metal containers,
paper products, and corrugated con-
tainers are far more significant to
Containers in profit terms —as well as
indicating that, other companies in these
fields should also be doing well.
The recent news from J. Fielding
of a higher profit and the report from
APM that packaging board sales had
increased substantially had already
given a fair hint that companies like
Reed Paper, Dodge Consolidated, Fibre
Containers, Queensland Can, and the
packaging divisions of ACI were on
the way up. And now the indication
that can-making is doing better should
be of particular significance to Con-
tainers’ associated company, Queens-
land Can, as well as to its rival, J.
Gadsden (both of which have been
strongly recommended here in recent
times).
THE Chartist makes a further com-
ment on Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie
(Aust.) Limited. This stock has
deteriorated technically since the
recommendation in the issue of
December 17, 1966, and sales have now
taken place at 98c, which has pene-
trated the basic trendline. There would
be no reason now to hold this stock on
technical grounds.

Nabisco on the Prowl Again?
By PELIAS in Melbourne
THOSE speculators prepared to
accept the high risk involved in
making a really big kill should
consider the shares of Mac. Robertson,
chocolate and confectionery manufac-
turer. Rumor has it that the U.S.-
controlled Nabisco group, famous for
the unsucessful takeover battle it staged
in an effort to get control of Swallow
and Ariell in 1964, is taking a very
close look at Mac. Robertson. The pos-
sibility has been considered before in
share market circles, but it currently
appears to have more chance of com-
ing off than it ever has before or ever
will again.
Share market rumors lead, as a
general rule, to burnt fingers. But last
week sources unconnected with the
market and cldse to Nabisco suggested
there could be some truth in them, so
the feasibility of such a move is worth
examination.
During the current calendar year,
the likelihood of a takeover will prob-
ably reach its highest point ever. Mac.-
Robertson seems certain to either omit
or reduce its final dividend for the
year to December 31 last. It is already
known that profits for the year will be
substantially below 1965. The situation
will make the company extremely prone
to takeover, especially as its 1967 out-
look will be clouded by the huge ex-
penses and operational difficulties con-
nected with the transfer to the new pre-
mises at Ringwood. Nabisco, whose
determination to make big profits in
Australia through winning a large slice
of the local food market is quite
obvious, is also moving to a new plant,
at Broadmeadows. If it really is eye-
ing Mac. Robertson off, it will never
get - a better buying opportunity than
that which will present itself during
1967.
J^JAC. ROBERTSON shareholders,
already disillusioned, seem due for
a really dry spell over the next two or
three years. Their shares were fetching
almost $2.50 two years ago; in the past
few weeks they have been horribly close
to par. The 1965 profit returned a
meagre 8.4 percent on capital and
barely covered the 8 percent dividend.
The substantially lower result expected
for 1966 will probably cut this, earning
rate to about 6.5 percent. Announcement
of the result is due next month. The
chances of the dividend being main-
tained are virtually nil. The group’s
liquidity is already extremely tight and
the need for funds to finance the opera-
tions of two factories for a period is
serious. A feeling of obligation to
shareholders could entice directors to
hold the payout, yet such a move
would not be in the longer-term in-
terests of the company.
Added to all this is the fact that the
group seems unlikely to ever retain its
former stature. Profits which once
flowed from its position as leader in
certain lines of confectionery have been
chopped seriously through stiff competi-
tion. This competition has even
extended to price cutting and the
creation of a situation where continu-
ally rising costs cannot be recouped by
increased prices. The company has
been forced into a greater reliance on
lower profit lines in its effort to main-
tain sales volume. Export business,
sales to chain stores, and the sale of
chocolate coatings to other food manu-
facturers have maintained turnover at
the expense of profit margins.
0F course, all is not gloom, and the
company will undoubtedly perform
on an acceptable basis eventually. The
new factory will cut its costs and,
initially, provide a boost to profits
through the tax savings applicable on
investment allowance. Its prod"'" tc - are
excellent, as is the management.
Although a family busines basically, all
but the very top positions are usually
filled by men who have worked their
way up through the company, or the
industry. Mac. Robertson has a good
business, and its previous chief lack,
efficiency, will be supplied by the new
factory.
For Nabisco, an acquistion could
have many advantages. The confec-
tionery business, especially the choco-
late side, is closely related to biscuit
production. Nabisco’s new Broad-
meadows factory will produce, among
other things, a range of quality sweet
biscuits and crackers. The company’s
distribution, at present from several
different plants, will be centred at the
site. This will be something of a dis-
advantage as far as delivering ro cus-
tomers on the other side of the city is
concerned—and Mac. Robertson’s new
plant is on the other side of the city.
Additionally, Nabisco is undoubtedly
searching for a business which can
provide a substantial flow of profits
while it is making its bite at the biscuit
market. Its attempts will undoubtedly
be money-losing at first and the Ameri-
can parent is well known for its aver-
sion to losses.
This is one reason why it offered
such ridiculously high prices for
Swallow’s shares in 1964. The return
on its layout would have been some-
what small, but losses could have been
prevented through profits from the
share of the market which Swallows
had. That is not to say that any bid
for Mac. Robertson will be as generous.
In the first place, a bid would be
unlikely to meet the countering action
which the Australian Biscuit Co. pro-
vided in its attempt to shut the com-
petitor out. But an offered price would
have to be well above the current
market of $1.22 to win a board recom-
mendation. Conservatively estimated,

Mac. Robertson has assets worth about
$2.50 a share.
So a takeover offer would be at
least reasonably logical in the near
future; whether it will come off or not
is another matter. Speculators stand
to make large capital gains or be stuck
with a parcel of shares which may not
show any price recovery for two years.
ANOTHER retailer who is moving
with the times and appears
sound buying is George Wardrop.
Inexplicably, to my mind, the $1
shares are fetching a mere 50 cents and
yielding a most enticing 10 percent
from the doubly covered 5 percent
dividend. The main factor behind this
unjustifiably low price is the company’s
extremely poor image, both financially
and publicly, of the last few years.
The market has yet to realise that
those days are now truly well and
gone. The company has sold its two
city stores and completely paid off
all its public borrowings. It has leased
a new store in Elizabeth Street which
is bigger than the previous two com-
bined and has the “with-it” look of
the most successful men’s stores in
Melbourne. In addition, the swing to
the suburbs has been joined with the
opening of a new store in Camberwell.
Although neither of them will have
operated for a full 12 months in the
current year, consolidated profit should
be greater than last year.. If so, the
chances of a dividend lift are strong.
Extra income will also be derived from
the absence of an interest bill on un-
secured borrowings. So the shares look
excellent buying for income purposes
and just as good for those seeking
market gains. There seems little reason
why the scrip should not return to par
by the end of this year.
INVESTORS who are mainly seeking
income should consider the merits
of Stegbar, supplier to the building
industry and mainly famous for its large
business as a manufacturer of alu-
minium and timber doors and windows.
The $1 shares are currently at $1.38
and yield 7.2 percent from last year’s
maiden 10 percent dividend rate. There
has been some disillusidhment over the
stock, mainly because earnings in its
maiden year fell from 19.2 to 14.6
percent on capital. But the dividend
cover is ample and there will be plenty
of scope for an increase once profits
return to normal.
This should prove to be in the current
year. Orders are believed to have been
higher in the first six months.
So the present dividend rate can be
regarded as secure. An increase is pos-
sible this year or in 1967-68, making the
stock doubly attractive to those who
are basically after income. For others,
there is some attraction in the view
generally held in the industry that,
eventually, Stegbar will meet the same
profitable fate as Dowell or be acquired
by one of the semi-fabricating alumin-
ium giants direct.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Cranes Are Flying High
BONUS fever has pushed the $1
shares of G. E. Crane Holdings Ltd.
to their highest point for five years
—and rightly so. This year the com-
pany is certain to celebrate its cen-
tenary in a generously appropriate way;
a bonus share issue is widely tipped.
But the prospect of a handout this
year is not the only reason for its
popular appeal, even at current prices
of $5.50. For since it suffered so
severely in the 1961 recession (taking
four years to build its profits back to
the boom year levels of 1960), the com-
pany has made a speciality of over-
coming adversity.
In 1964-65, its copper and brass
rolling and tube mills were disorgan-
ised by the Mt. Isa strike, but the
company, nevertheless, managed a 40
percent profit rise; in 1965-66, the
downturn in housing activity that so
disturbed rival plumbers’ supply com-
pany John Mcllwraith was not enough
to prevent Crane’s pre-tax profit
rising a further 27 percent. This year’s
profit should once again demonstrate
Crane’s ability to put in record results
even when business conditions are not
entirely favorable. And next year,
when (or if) a more respectable rate
of economic growth is restored, the
company should do very well.
Crane’s steadily improving profit-
ability, especially when related to
capital, has been all the more remark-
able in the last two years because it
largely caters not only for the building
trade but also the depressed consumer
durable goods industries, with its
aluminium, brass and copper in sheet,
strip, coil and circle form, plumbers’
brassware, copper tubing, aluminium
extrusions, aluminium tubing for irri-
gation, roofing materials and building
sheet, contract moulding and machin-
ing. Crane has the majority of the
local market for collapsible metal tubes
in lead, tin and aluminium for phar-
maceuticals, chemicals and food, and
of aerosol cans, but the competition is
still considered fierce.
N OT only have recent years been
problem ones for large sectors of
Crane’s markets, but the company has
been in the midst of a massive expan-
sion program, the full benefits of which
have not yet appeared in the accounts.
Over the last five years, Crane has
spent $4.2m. on new plant, or $1
million more than the book value of its
plant in 1962. This has provided invest-
ment allowances for tax purposes and
the management sees no levelling off in
capital expenditure, although it does
fluctuate with the products in demand.
During the last five years, assets
have more than doubled to $23.6 mil-
lion; shareholders’ funds have done
likewise to $l4 million; so has capital
(now up at $3.5 million), and divi-
dends. But earnings have gone up only
about 50 percent from the 1960 peak
(even though they have quadrupled
since the 1961 recession). Not only are
the company’s earning rates still well
below those of 1960 (profit last year fell
about $| million short of that); they
are still well down on the averages
of the three years before the 1960
boom, suggesting that if the company
is to justify its huge developments in
earnings terms, it still has some solid
profit rises yet to come.
This expansion appears to have been
one reason for Crane altering in
1963-64 its investment in Comalco
Products from an equity holding to a
repayable loan that would provide
assured income immediately (about
$66,000 a year plus its loan repay-
ments) rather than uncertain returns
later (particularly as Comalco Pro-
ducts is a subsidiary company in the
CRA-Kaiser group and its results need
not represent its real profitability).
Nevertheless the company should
have explained these drastic changes
to its 1961-62 agreement with Comalco.
Under it, Comalco had agreed to
invest s2.Bm. over two and a half years
to acquire 203,800 £1 shares (as they
were then) at £6 premium. In return
Crane was to invest $1,348,000 by
acquiring 300,000 £1 shares (at 10
percent interest) in the Comalco fab-
ricating subsidiary, Comalco Products,
and advancing $748,000 as a loan. This
loan has been repaid and the sl.4m.
equity investment is now down to a
loan with $1.2 million outstanding.
So Comalco has a hefty slice of
Crane equity capital (20 percent) and
a strong voice in Crane’s management
through its board nominee, Comalco
managing director Mr. D. J. Hibberd,
even though Crane and Comalco are
active competitors in some areas (but
by no means over all).
The primary purpose of the associa-
tion originally was “mutual support in
the production of aluminium mill pro-
ducts and to avoid the duplication of
semi-fabrication capacity.” This seems
largely to have gone by the board for,
although Comalco still supplies most
of Crane’s primary aluminium re-
quirements, the two companies now
compete freely in fabricated and semi-
fabricated aluminium products.
IMPART from the vitally important
question of technical advice and re-
search, Crane seems to have got out
of the deal with a tied source of
aluminium, not any apparent advan-
tage in a well-supplied market. And it
has money still laid out in Comalco
in a long-term interest bearing loan,
which it probably could use better in
its own concern.
It is clearly in Comalco’s best inter-
ests to build up Crane’s aluminium
metal consumption as high as possible,
in keeping with the trend toward metal
makers tying up semi-fabricating or
product companies (as Alcoa has done
with Dowell and Overseas Corpora-
tion). It is up to Crane’s board to
keep insisting that both metal con-
sumption and profits increase at the
same rate.
Undoubtedly aluminium is the
growth area for Crane, as consump-
tion of aluminium per capita in Aus-
tralia has doubled from 7.11 b. to
14.21 b. since 1961. With copper prices
high, the overall usage of brass and

copper flat products is not keeping pace
with population increase, and there is
some substitution by aluminium. But
Crane catches on the swings what it
loses on these roundabouts. Notwith-
standing high copper prices, let it be
noted that national usage of copper
tubing is increasing markedly.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to estab-
lish exactly which sectors of the com-
pany contributed to last year’s profit
rise, apart from the evident jump in
returns from exports of copper fabri-
cations during the period last year when
Australian copper prices were held so
far below world prices. Crane
admitted to record exports of $926,000
(no previous figures are available, and
total turnover is never divulged), but
says that it is not basically an export
business and that it never benefits from
copper rises, as it has to provide against
fluctuations. Yet, pursuit of export
markets also gave Crane some tax
benefits in 1965-66.
indication of areas of pro-
fitability comes from the rise of
$116,000 in the proportion of profit
due to outside shareholders in subsid-
iaries a most significant figure since
group net profit rose by only $75,000.
So it seems that Crane Enfield Metals
Pty. (53 percent owned), with its
copper tubing and aluminium extru-
sions and tubing, offset a net profit fall
in other lines.
However, this does not suggest poorer
returns from trading, as the reason for
this was the 70 percent increase in tax
provision to an unusually high rate
(indicating that the company may
have been salting some of last year’s
profits away).
In any event, tax proportion should
fall this year. Purchase of Australian
Factors Ltd., in June 1966, at a cost
of $443,000 could provide the company
with tax losses of up to $2.7m., which
would be worth sl.lm. in saved tax,
if the Tax Commissioner approves.
This net gain to Crane of $657,000
could be realised in two years.
Stocks were down slightly and
debtors rose from ssm. to $5.4m. in
the last accounts. Current investment
in shares and debentures would refer
to the 44 percent interest in Ideal
Capsules (Aust.) Pty. Ltd., where
Crane is partnered by Metal Closures
Ltd., of U.K., and the 50 percent
interest in Concord Metals Pty. Ltd.,
where partners are another Australian
public company and private companies.
William Atkins arranged in May,
1965, to distribute exclusively Crane’s
aluminium products in N.S.W.,
Queensland, Victoria and S.A., and its
subsidiaries were to distribute (but not
on an exclusive basis) Crane copper
and brass products. However, copper
price increases last year made Atkins
wary, so it put in only token stocks of
copper products until the price settled
down. Only in the last three months
or so has it built up stocks, and then
concentrated on fast moving lines.
Rearrangements of borrowing
reduced bank overdraft to slm., but
increased short-term loans and
unsecured loans at call by that amount.
There were only sl.Bm. term liabilities,
so the proprietorship ratio is uncom-
monly high. Capital reserves of $7.5m.
give ample scope for benefits to holders
of the $3.5m. capital, unappropriated
profits of s3m. providing further
internal strength.
At $5.50, the market is expecting
something more generous than another'
dividend increment (last year a bonus
li percent was added to the basic 121-
percent) but, quite apart from bonus
share issue prospects, this company’s
rapid expansion and sound prospects
merit a price earnings ratio of at least
its current 15 times.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Something about Clyde
LAST week an attempt was made
to approach the appraisal of a
stock on the basis of projecting
future earnings from an estimate of
future sales. Regrettably, this approach
is also limited to a significant extent
by the fact that very few companies
disclose their sales figures even on a
value basis and even less on a volume
basis. This means that estimates of
future earnings must be made without
the benefit of a knowledge of sales
figures.
One such company would be Clyde
Industries Ltd. and it would be fair
to say that even if Clyde did disclose
consolidated sales figures these would
not be of much value because of the
extremely diverse nature of the group’s
activities. Basically, the emphasis has
always been on heavy engineering.
Before World War 11, products in-
cluded agricultural machinery, rolling
stock, mining plant and machinery,
locomotive engines, tramcars, cranes,
steelworks plant and equipment, and
bridge construction.
After the war the progression to
diesel-electric locomotives would seem
to be quite logical, as was the manu-
facture of omnibuses, following the
pre-war manufacture of tramcars. Road-
making equipment is probably closely
aligned with agricultural machinery and
also the manufacture of trailers (Freu-
hauf) and assembly of motor vehicles
would not be far removed from old-
established activities.
With the 1963 annual report, the
company issued a booklet entitled
“Something About Clyde.” This publi-
cation sets out clearly and in some
detail the products which the Clyde
group of companies manufactures for
and/or supplies to Australian industry.
The introduction includes the following
paragraph: “The Clyde Group is an
organisation of companies providing
products, facilities, and services linked
with almost every sphere of industrial
endeavor.” The main headings in the
text are: Transportation, automotive
products, material handling, products
for industry, earth-moving, mining and
power, and the domestic field.
The statistics are:

These statistics indicate that the
group profit has a cyclical pattern, but
this is hardly different to what one
would expect, bearing in mind that
since 1960 the Australian economy has
been subjected to two booms and two
“depressions. - ” (I suppose “recessions”
would be a kinder word.) Furthermore,
the group “provides products, facilities,
and services to almost every sphere of
industrial endeavor,” so it is to be
expected that results would follow the
pattern of Australian industry as a
whole.
Per share earnings showed quite good
growth until 1965/66, having increased
from 7.4 cents in 1960/61 to 11.0 cents
in 1964/65. The increase would be of
the order of 49 percent, which repre-
sents an average of about lff| percent
per annum compound. It is, however,
likely that this represented the rate of
growth from the bottom of a recession
to the peak of a boom and not the
long-term growth rate through booms
and recessions. One wonders how many
of the popular stocks have been priced
in recent years on similar growth rates
which were also ill-founded. No doubt
many have since suffered severe price
falls when 1965/66 showed that the
trend was not continuing.
It has already been mentioned that
“transportation” seems to be the “in-
dustry” upon which a large part of
Clyde’s activities are based and it is
likely that the demand for capital
equipment by the “transporters” will
tend to vary. Locomotives and rolling
stock are probably mainly supplied to
the various Departments of Railways,
although there will be a certain demand
from private sources. Orders from this
source are dependent on the supply of
finance that is available, but it seems
that Clyde has obtained a substantial
order to build 17 locomotives for the
new standard gauge line from Fremantle
to Kalgoorlie plus another five loco-
motives for the Western Australian
Railways. The Queensland Railways
has also placed an order for another
twenty locomotives. There seems to be
little doubt that the locomotive build-
ing side of the group will remain busy
during 1966/67.
Martin & King Industries Pty. Ltd.,
which produces motor vehicle bodies,
Freuhauf road and rail equipment, roll-
ing stock and railway carriages, and
also assembles Renault cars, appears to
be maintaining a steady rate of pro-
duction.
The sections of the group which seem
to have had a more difficult time in
1965/66 are as follows: Raco Corpor-
ation, which produces kitchenware and
had “disappointing” results in 1965/66;
Clyde Securities, where the net profit
for 1965/66 was only 0.7 percent of
ordinary capital; Glazebrooks Paints &
Chemicals, which traded at a loss in
1965/66; British Standard Machinery,
which produces earthmoving and
similar equipment, also had disappoint-
ing results in 1965/66, due to intense
competition and reduced demand for
roadmaking equipment; Regents Motors
(Holdings) also had a difficult year
and has been closing unprofitable out-
lets (this group distributes Volkswagen
and Rovers and Land-Rovers)..
\\ r ITH a group such as the Clyde
Group, it is difficult to see how
future growth can be very different to
the growth of the economy as a whole.
Furthermore, the demand for certain
of the group’s major products may well
be subject to the availability of finance
to semi-governmental bodies.
Over the past six years, the company
has distributed, in the form of ordinary
dividends, 77 percent of its disclosed
earnings and in 1963/64 the distribution
for the year was 66 percent of the dis-
closed earnings for the year. If it could
be assumed that, in the future, divi-
dend distribution might keep pace in
the long run with earnings, then one
could derive a figure for a price/earn-
ings multiple based on the assumption
that future earnings per share could be
expected to grow at an average rate of,
say, 3 percent per annum compound.
This multiple would also assume that
future dividends wold be discounted at
9 percent per annum. On this basis, the
multiple would come out at 12.3 times
1965/66 earnings.
Currently the shares are selling at less
than ten times 1965/66 earnings, so
some scope for price appreciation exists
provided that earnings in 1966/67 do
improve slightly. At this stage, this
seems entirely possible.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
In a tolerably calm market the interims and “special situa-
tions” are the obvious decisive forces. On its report Rothmans
was brought back with a bang, finishing 43 cents lower at $2.05.
Other tobaccos were at first sought higher, but tended to steady
out; both British Tobacco and Philip Morris came back to
their previous week’s level. Australian Guarantee naturally
claimed keen attention, leaping 20 cents to $1.85 and shedding a
10 cent lustre on Bank of N.S.W., which went to $5.26. Sugars
improved, with Fairymead and Millaquin adding 10 and 8 cents
respectively. Felt and Textiles moved above par to 55 cents.

The Support for Aberfoyle
NOW that Aberfoyle has sold its 23
percent interest in Western
Titanium N.L. for an estimated
$2.4 million it should be able to main-
tain its 51 percent interest in Cleve-
land Tin N.L. on fairly advantageous
terms. However, it will mean a repeti-
tion of Aberfoyle shareholders sacrific-
ing a dividend to the dictates of group
liquidity. This has become a fairly
regular sacrifice in recent years, but per-
haps this time will be rather more re-
warding than in the past. If Aberfoyle
is able to finance further calls of 20
cents on its 9,298,000 Cleveland Tin
N.L. shares, this will add a further 41
cents to the asset backing of Aberfoyle
shares and mean that at least $1.25 of
the Aberfoyle share price is accounted
for by its holding in Cleveland Tin
N.L. (That is assuming Cleveland Tin
shares are 20 cents more than their
current price when paid to 40 cents.)
While the actual sale has improved
group liquidity, Aberfoyle Holdings
last year received dividends amounting
to $120,000 from these shares. It has
received an interim dividend amount-
ing to $60,000 in the current financial
year. Increased income can hardly be
expected from either Ardlethan Tin
N.L. or North Australian Uranium Cor-
poration N.L., while Cleveland Tin
N.L. will not be paying dividends for at
least 18 months. In the face of these
prospects what is there to support
Aberfoyle shares at their current level?
Ignoring for the moment the com-
pany’s 51 percent interest in Paringa
Mining and Exploration Limited and
its percent interest in Greenbushes
Tin N.L., Aberfoyle Holdings Ltd.
consists of three operating tin mines and
one, Cleveland Tin, under develop-
ment. Evaluation of the holdings in
Ardlethan, NAUC, and Cleveland is
simply a matter of the market price
(for these companies, but Aberfoyle’s
own mine, Aberfoyle Tin N.L., is not a
listed company. It has, nevertheless,
been operating longer than any of the
other Aberfoyle group tin companies
and has earned a profit and paid a
dividend each year since 1933. Over
the period since then it has shown
a very regular history of small but
progressive increases in ore produc-
tion, which has doubled in the 13
years from 1953. As an underground
mine its costs are less than those en-
countered by the underground mine
operated by North Australian Uranium
Corporation N.L. but higher (by 30
percent) than the costs of Ardlethan
Tin N.L.’s open-cut operation. Profit
earned by Aberfoyle Tin N.L. per ton
of tin/tungsten is higher than that
earned by either NAUC or Ardlethan
(almost double Ardlethan’s figure) and
is also above the profit per ton of tin
that Cleveland Tin N.L. is expected to
earn on the figures shown in its pros-
pectus.
Last year Aberfoyle Tin N.L. earned
a profit of $373,000 against Ardlethan’s
$238,000 and NAUC’s $191,000, the
latter figure being NAUC’s profit from
its mine its Dorset dredge lost
money last year. Aberfoyle Tin in 1966
produced 437 tons of tin and 116 tons
of tungsten compared with NAUC’s 125
tons of tin and 241 tons of tungsten
and Ardlethan’s 658 tons of tin. Admit-
tedly, reserves at the Aberfoyle mine
are sufficient for perhaps only four
years’ operation, while NAUC and
Ardlethan both have upward of seven
years’ reserves. Continued development
by Aberfoyle, however, at its Lutwyche
area could easily double Aberfoyle’s
present ore reserves and increase ore
reserve grade. The higher grade of tin
ore indicated in the Lutwyche area
would allow this venture to make good
profits on tin prices lower than those
being encountered at the present time.
At current prices, the share market
places a value of approximately s2m
on each of the operations conducted by
NAUC and Ardlethan. The comparison
of these ventures with Aberfoyle’s own
mine suggests a value somewhat higher
than these companies, with the only
qualification being Aberfoyle Tin’s lack
of reserves.
The present valuation of shares in
Ardlethan, NAUC, Cleveland, Green-
bushes, and Paringa accounts for a total
of $1.42 per Aberfoyle share and, while
the market price is $1.85 per share,
the market appears to be imputing a
value of $2 million or 42 cents per
share for Aberfoyle Tin N.L. At the
present time this value seems reason-
able. For the future, Aberfoyle share-
holders can look forward to a
considerable rise in this valuation
should the company be able to prove
up reserves on the Lutwyche deposit,
and, of course, the payment of future
calls on Cleveland Tin N.L. shares
has a built-in increment of 41 cents
per Aberfoyle share.

New Perspectives for Sugar
SUGAR has at last found a floor.
With prices around a post-war
low of a ton late last
month, sugar was competitive in
several non-food areas in the chemical
industry. Molasses and sugar were pur-
chased by three or four chemical firms.
One American group is to make in-
dustrial alcohol from its purchase.
However, some of the competitive
edge came off when other buyers,
worried at the firmer trend, moved
in, boosting prices to £stg. 17 a ton in
short time. A little of this gain was
later lost, but there is a new perspec-
tive in the market now, and further
dips to around £l2 do not seem likely
for some time.
Although there is little scope for a
return to economic price levels in, say,
the next year, sugar may be entering
a new phase. Consumption has been
gradually moving up, while production
has levelled off. Cuba has also shown
more interest in negotiating for world
production quotas.
Stocks this year may only grow 2.5
million tons, to 22.5 million, according
to the latest forecast.
Although there was a flurry of
interest in sugar shares during the
London gyrations recently, the
Brisbane sugar index is still bumping
along at around 105, compared with
a high of about 140 and a low of 100-odd
last year. Not until there is some
more hopeful news from overseas is
the local sugar share likely to show
new life.
THE London copper market has
been little affected in recent weeks
by high-level to-ing and fro-ing
over Union Miniere’s expropriated
Congo copper mines. The Congo Gov-
ernment has attempted to get together
an international consortium of financial
and mining interests to run the Belgian
group’s operations. The Rothschilds and
Mr. Harry Oppenheimer’s Anglo-
American group, among others, have
been involved in talks, though all have
been careful to emphasise their concern
for Union Miniere’k compensation.
(The Congo Government claims that
the company owes it a large amount of
money, in addition to the assets take-
over.) .
The' pipeline of supplies from the
Congo to world markets is far from
exhausted, meanwhile, and consumers
will not be directly affected by Congo
developments for some time.
Elsewhere in Africa, Anglo-American
has reduced its Zambian copper sales
to 55 percent of normal. This was first
said by the company to be due to
“transport difficulties,” but then the
reason was switched to “sales policy.”
The other, Zambian group, Roan
Selection Trust, is maintaining deliveries
at 100 percent. The reason for this
difference has not been satisfactorily
explained in market circles, although
plenty of explanations are offered. Over
a year, Anglo’s action would mean the
loss of 190,000 tons to consumers.
(Actual output of both groups is only
75 percent of normal, because of coal
shortages, but until now supplies have
been kept at 100 percent.)
The copper market’s refusal to budge
above £stg.4so a ton or so is a re-
flection of the considerable cut in Euro-
pean demand. U.S. and some Chinese
buying have prevented any decline in
London prices, however.
Copper is still the metal most vulner-
able to a reduction in use for the Viet-
nam war. The market is beginning to
speculate on the likely future level of
copper prices. The “right” price, it
seems generally believed, would be £350
a ton. However, when prices fall, they
are likely to leave this “right” price
high and dry.

MAN ON THE LAND
A Grant of Water Rights
OVER the last month or so one
might easily have gained the
impression that the only thing
happening in Victoria was the hang-
ing of Ryan. In fact, there were a num-
ber of far-reaching decisions made by
the Government (not that the hang-
ing issue was unimportant, of course)
and one of them which interests us
particularly concerns irrigation water.
The Government has decided to make
a special allocation of water from the
Murray below r Swan Hill to the vast
project planned by Cohn Bros. (Vic-
toria) and McCarthy Bros. (Cali-
fornia).
A special application means what it
says. This joint Australian/U.S. ven-
ture will get water rights exceeding
those which any Australian farmer
might hope to obtain. Sir Henry Bolte
has enough critics as it is and it would
be too easy altogether to charge that
the Victorian Government has decided
to give away water (provided by tax-
payers over the years) to U.S. interests.
The issue here is not easy. It is very
complex, indeed, and is a perfect illus-
tration of how, whether we like it or
not, the U.S. takeover occurs. In the
economic sense, it is difficult to
criticise the decision. It should, after all,
aid balanced State development. No
one else is prepared to spend the kind
of money, on a project of this kind,
that Cohn and McCarthy have avail-
able.
Nevertheless, this is not quite the
same as U.S. cattle interests in the far
north, where it can be shown it is a
case of allowing the Americans in or
doing nothing for many years. Swan
Hill is already a highly developed
agricultural area and there would be
thousands of potential Australian farm-
ers who would jump at the chance of
obtaining an irrigation farm there.
Climate and amenities would encourage
family farms. Alas, too few Australians
(of the right age) have the money to
buy farms.
Opposition Leader Mr. Stone-
ham has attacked the decision to
grant the water rights to Cohn and Mc-
Carthy. It is, he says, a scandal that
the public subsidy on irrigation water
will be going to build up profits for
transfer to the United States. It will
mean, he says, that young Australians,
unless wealthy, will no longer be able
to become irrigation farmers.
We say that they cannot do that
now and that one of the reasons, at least
an important reason, has been the pro-
liferation of public sector activity in
this country, dating from the Chifley
era. Most of the taxation-consuming
subsidies and plans (about 15 in all we
think) were Chifley creations. There
appears to us to be only one valid
economic criticism of the Cohn and
McCarthy deal. It can not be claimed
that the Americans will introduce any-
thing revolutionary in the way of
techniques or machinery. In this
locality, anything they can do we can
do, and probably better. Australian
farming methods bear more than
favorable comparison with American
methods in the broad sense.
There are always exceptions where
particular crops (cotton, perhaps) are
involved, but, overall, one Australian
farm worker produces enough food for
50 people, whereas the American figure
is around 30. This figure, a generalisa-
tion certainly, nevertheless indicates
that the Australian farmer, by world
standards, is no slouch.
The Bolte Government can’t be
accused of doing nothing for Australian
settlers. Since 1955 it has made a total

B
of $36 million available for soldier
settlement and some 6000 families have
been settled on farms at East Goulburn,
Yanakie, and Heytesbury. The scheme
is now being carried on for non-
servicemen, but the fact remains that
applications far exceed farms.
Getting away from pure economics,
there must be a doubt in many people’s
minds that releasing additional water
is not strictly within the principle of
irrigation as envisaged by the original
planners. Irrigation projects were
started in Australia, despite enormous
problems, with the thought in mind
that these projects would be for Aus-
tralian citizens. It was well known
at the time that foreign (mostly British)
interests would inevitably have first call
on large-scale grazing operations. It was
also well realised, and this still applies,
that much of the best land was already
in sheep and that the occupiers would
resist strongly any scheme to alter the
land use to something more intensive.
The Cohn and McCarthy project is
inspiring in its vastness. Nearly 3000
acres will be under vegetables and
lucerne. The Victorian Government be-
lieves that it will result in increased
employment in the Swan Hill area in
manufacturing and processing.
'J'HE Victorian Minister for Water
Supply, Mr. Darcy, said that the
Government had made the special
allocation after considering a report by
the Director of the Division of State
Development, Mr. N. Howard, who had
made a comprehensive inquiry into the
proposals and had heard evidence from
many interested organisations and
individuals. The water for the project
would come from a quota of 60,000
acre feet set aside in 1963 for irrigation
below Nyah, of which only about 10,000
acre feet had so far been allocated.
The Government had rejected the
applicant’s request for an allocation of
water for cereal growing as part of the
venture, as this was “an unjustified use
for high value water.” It had therefore
limited the allocation to a maximum
of 6000 acre feet by the end of 1970,
to be used for the permanent develop-
ment of high value crops. But it would
not object to the growing of cereal crops
as part of the land preparation proced-
ure during the development period up
to 1970.
As Cohn Bros., for some years, have
had strong links with Carlton and
United Breweries, it would not be sur-
prising if some of the produce of this
enterprise is directed at malting. It
would appear, to us, to be a classic
example of vertical integration and, if
the American pattern is followed, the
supermarket (and/or tied house hotel)
seems the logical marketing end-
outlet. The farming side will be factory-
farming, not family-farming. There is
no suggestion that tenant farmers will
be utilised. However, it would be quite
possible that local small farmers might
consign produce to Cohn and McCarthy
if they care to handle it. This is the
U.S. pattern and seems to be coming
to Australia.

The Trouble with Tractors
THE news this week is not news at
all, really, because anyone who has
driven tractors knows that they
are devilishly dangerous. But it is not
realised widely enough that the paddock
toll compares with the road toll, which
everyone agrees is appalling. Each year
about 8000 people throughout Australia
are seriously injured in tractor accidents
and another 100 are killed outright.
Since, there are fewer tractors than
cars, these figures mean that tractor
users face twice the risk of being in-
jured than car users. However, the
tractor accidents result in death only
half as often as road accidents.
Macabre as these facts are, they in-
dicate only a part of the human dis-
tress and suffering attributable to trac-
tors. Their noisiness, joltiness, and
vibration cause a host of troubles among
those who ride them often. Permanent
partial deafness is common among
tractor users. Mr. G. L. McDonald,
of the Department of Mechanical
Engineering, University of Queensland,
has found that 16 percent of cane
farmers have lost much of their sense
of hearing and about half of the
farmers he tested had less than normal
hearing. Continued exposure to loud
noise also causes migraine, duodenal
ulcers, colitis, various stomachy com-
plaints, and severe fatigue. Fatigue is
often a factor in accidents. The stand-
ard way of measuring the arduousness
of a day’s work shows that the driver
of the tractor which is operating near
its peak, as when pulling a plough, ex-
pends more energy in the course of the
day than his mate who has spent the
day digging the ground with a spade.
This remarkable discovery was made
in West Germany, where an X-ray
study of 310 professional tractor drivers
revealed that over 70 percent of them
had damaged spinal columns. Fourteen
percent was the figure for the control
group, i.e., seemingly similar people in
the same age group who were not
tractor drivers. Chronic stomach ail-
ments of one sort or another were 76
percent more common among the
tractor drivers than the non-drivers.
The German doctors also reported that
acuity of vision, sense of balance, and
steadiness of hand were all impaired
to a much greater extent in tractor
drivers.
At the Tractor Testing Station,
Werribee, Victoria, a Melbourne Uni-
versity agricultural engineer came upon
one make of tractor with a noise out-
put of 114 decibels. Most makes average
about 85 decibels, but readings in the
90-100 decibel range have been found
fairly frequently at the station. These
measurements were made at near-peak
power output. A farmer working his
tractor on full bore while pulling a
noisy machine such as a harvester
might, therefore, have his ears blasted
by much more than 100 decibels.
Children and people whose hearing
has not been already dulled find 100
decibels painful if the sound continues
for very long. Ninety decibels is
generally accepted as the loudest noise
that anyone should be expected to
tolerate, even for a short period. By
way of comparison, an old-fashioned
alarm clock produces about 80 decibels,
field artillery pieces subject the gunners
to about 110 decibels, and modern jet
passenger aircraft sounding off to take
off hurl some 130 decibels into the ears
of close bystanders.
Very effective mufflers which do not
seriously detract from engine perform-
ance have been designed for tractor
exhausts, according to the university
engineers. Surely it is not too much to
expect that the manufacturers should fit
them as standard equipment. While
most of the mufflers presently supplied
do cut engine noise appreciably, some
have been found in the course of testing
at Werribee which actually augment
the racket. Some types of spark arresters
also amplify the noise. It is not sur-
prising that some farmers take them
off.
Under the circumstances, farmers
should try to provide themselves with
some protection. Ear plugs in sizes to
fit every ear are fairly readily available.
If properly fitted they reduce noise by
about 25 percent. However, most ear
specialists recommend the ear muff, as
it is safer and gives at least as much
protection. On sale in the U.S.A. for
$4OO is a special tractor driver’s helmet.
It completely encloses the head and in-
corporates a refrigerator so that cool
air can be circulated around the face.
MA McDONALD up in Queensland
has analysed a large number of
tractor accident reports from all around
Australia. He has reached the conclu-
sion that some 30 design features are
responsible for most of the accidents.
Many of these faulty features are
associated with the ease of mounting
or dismounting from the tractor’s seat.
A clutter of levers and pedals increases
the likelihood of a sleeve or a trouser
leg catching and releasing the brake
or throwing the machine into gear just
as the driver is swinging down in front
of the wheels. If you value your life
don’t buy anybody’s tractor no matter
how good he claims it to be or how
suitable for your work if it doesn’t let
you get on and off easily.
Mr. McDonald says that everv
tractor should be equipped with a
structurally sound canopy or cabin.
This will save you in a roll-over. It will
also let you work in greater comfort.
Less stress means less fatigue, hence
less chance of an accident. And don’t
think that because your farm happens
to be flat you won’t have an accident.
A report from New Zealand tells that
58 percent of all fatal accidents in that
hilly country have occurred where the
slope did not exceed 10 degrees.


Chess Bulletin
LAJOS STEINER
IF I were asked to describe Inter-
national Master Lajos Steiner in the
briefest possible manner I would reply
that he is Australia’s greatest chess
player and is also one of nature’s
greatest gentlemen.
Fortunately, I do not have to be so
confined in my remarks. He was born
in Hungary in June, 1903. His was
indeed a chess family, as his father
was well known in Europe for his chess
prowess. His brother Endre was a
chess master, and Steiner had the
rating of expert at the age of 12. When
asked the usual question as to when
he first learned the moves, he became
really puzzled. This was justified, as it
occurred when he was simply too young
to remember.
Lajos Steiner acquired the title of
Hungarian Master at the age of 19.
Under the present method of qualifica-
tion he would have been awarded the
title of International Master one year
later. His first great success was in
Kecskemet (Hungary), where he tied
for second place with • Nimzovitch
behind former world champion Alex-
ander Alekhine.
In 1936, Steiner made a world tour,
which included a long stay in Aus-
tralia. He enjoyed his visit to this
country so much that in 1939 he re-
turned to settle here permanently. The
following year he married Edna King-
ston, who, at the time, was Australia’s
foremost woman player.
His Australian record very briefly is
as follows: Four times Australian
champion (1945, 1946-7, 1952-3, and
1958-9) from six attempts; he played
in ten N.S.W. championships and won
on nine occasions; his only “failure”
was in 1954, when he had to settle for
second prize behind John Kellner.
Steiner’s hint to beginners: “Do not
in your games try to evolve Grand-
master combinations. First, become
really acquainted with basic principles.
This will help you to construct simple
combinations, and, after all, one must
have many small bricks before he can
build a mansion.”
Here is my favorite Steiner game. It
was played in the international tourna-
ment, Berlin, in 1928.

Nimzovitch was about his own theories
Steiner gambles with psychology. He
virtually challenged his illustrious
opponent to play . . . P-KR4 and he
swallowed the bait. Better was natural
development first.

SPECULATORS DIARY
A Beer Maker and a Seller
ONE of the victims of the terrible
fire disaster in Hobart was the
Cascade Brewery. Burnt to the
ground, it will probably take at least
twelve months before the beer starts
flowing again. All this must mean a
sudden jolt to the share price, which
has held steady at $2.60 this year. In
fact, a few panic, sellers could provide
a cheap entry into the stock.
For the time being, however, I’ll
stick to mainland stocks. Perhaps I
should be going to the far north and
investing in some of the sugar stocks.
With the world sugar price up, sugar
shares are at last showing signs of
revival.
Last week I was talking about the
sober state of the market. To divorce
myself somewhat from that mood I
settled on 400 Tooheys for the first
purchase of the week. From a high
point this year of $1.14, Toohey’s
shares have drifted back to $l. It’s
hard to find a satisfactory explanation
for this fall. Certainly it does not re-
flect the recent profit performance of
the company. Despite the drought last
year, profit rose slightly and dividend
rate was increased from 8.5 percent to
8.75 percent. And unlike its opposition,
Tooths, profits should be up again in
the current year. Why, then, is the
share selling near its low point for the
last two years?
If beer is a good investment, then
so also should be the people who sell
it. The stock I have in mind here is
Australia Hotel. When it was disclosed
last year that one of the directors, N.
B. Rydge, had been a substantial buyer
of the shares around the 40 cent mark,
the shares promptly moved above par.
A reaction has brought them back to
about 46 cents.
L IKE a good few older listed com-
panies, asset backing is more im-
pressive than recent earning perform-
ance. So that while book asset backing
stands at a respectable 76 cents (realis-
able asset backing could be considerably
higher), the company has barely
broken even in the last three years.
Nevertheless, directors seem confident
about the future, having spent over
$200,000 on hotel modernisation last
year. No doubt they have in mind the
prospect of the number of tourists com-
ing to Australia doubling from 174,000
to 320,000 in the next four years. This
should considerably improve occu-
pancy, provided, of course, that the
Australia Hotel can maintain its share
of the market. All in all, it seems that
the interest in the share price in the
last few months is justified. I’m justi-
fying it a bit more by buying 500
shares at 46 cents!
The final purchase of the week was
200 Dunlop at $1.45. Like a few other
buyers in the market, these were
bought solely on the information in the
interim report. The following break-
down in profits is startling evidence of
the trading recovery in the current
year:
6 mths. to Dec. 31, 1965 . . $2,107,000
6 mths. to June 30, 1966 . . $1,302,000
6 mths. to Dec. 31, 1966 . . $2,653,000
A continuation of this performance
could ultimately see a return to the
10 percent dividend rate paid for
several years up to 1964. The 4 cent
interim dividend due next month is
also worth taking into consideration.
The only sale this week was the 500
Tulloch at 55 cents. More a case of
disappointment than anything else.
The week’s transactions were:
SOLD
500 Tulloch, 55c $269
BOUGHT
500 Australia Hotel, 46c $235
200 Dunlop, $1.45 $297
400 Tooheys, $l.Ol $414
The biggest shock this week was the
announcement of the Mid-Eastern
issue. If the oil market does come alive,
it should be able to take this sizable
issue in its stride.

cools in summer, warms in winter, stimulates concentra-
tion, increases work capacity, reduces physical fatigue.
COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY: POPE Air Conditioning

able to cope easily with rushes when they enjoy the
benefits of POPE Air Conditioning. Merchandise stays

conditioned premises.

sapped by excessive humidity or bitter cold when your
premises are air conditioned by POPE. Automatically,
moisture is balanced. Automatically, dust and pollen are
removed from the air—employees are less prone to hay
fever, colds and flu; absenteeism reduced 2.5%.

for itself.

taste. Rothmans King Size really satisfies.
