NIGHT AND THE TIDE.
Through the mighty harbor gates the salt-sea tide
sweeps in,
Up the sweet blue reaches, laving beach and
pier and pile,
Gathering the City filth as foul as City sin.
Purging, cleansing all the deep-blue basin man
makes vile.
So the broad and brimming water on its mission
rolls.
Bringing sea things with it, ivorv-yellow froth
and foam,
Sea-weed on its surface floating, feeding fish in
shoals,
And a wave-worn ship that comes through many
tempests home.-
When again the tide goes out it bears among its
freight
One still passenger, whom dawn or wind shall
never wake;
Livid, facing to the moon—that shines in silver
state.
Like a lovely lotus lonely dreaming on a lake.
N.S.W.
P. E. QUINN.
The Rude Forefathers
Of the gospels which form the beginning
of the testament relating to the British
settlement of Australia, the most valuable in
many respects is that of David Collips, the
first Judge Advocate and Secretary of
N,S.W. Not so light as Tench’s, nor so
heavy as Hunter’s, it has the solid qualities
of Phillip’s record with a better literary
style, and of all the journals of the First
Fleet it is one which the historian could
least afford to lose. G. B. Barton, in
that splendid beginning of a History of
N.S. W. from, the Records, quotes more fre-
quently from Collins than anyone else.
Collins was a kindly, unassertive
man, a good factotum, who filled as
many offices in the early days of the
settlement as Pooh-Bali. Some things
of importance did not attract him, but
he saw nearly everything that was done
in the management of the infant com-
munity, the building of Sydney and the
foundation of its industries, and he jotted it
all down in his daily journal. The first
volume of his Account of the English Colony
in N.S.W., virtually a reprint of the diary,
was published in 1798. The second volume,
based on material supplied by Hunter, ap-
peared in 1802. They are now scarce, and
bring £5 or more in the market. Though
indispensable to the historian, they are too
detailed for the general reader, and Collins
was wise enough to provide for an abridg-
ment. This was made in excellent style by
his wife. The poor woman shuddered at
the sound of the lash which swished so often
in her husband’s pages, but she went
through with her job gallantly. The second
edition retains all that is of general interest
in the first, and is a much more readable
book.
Whitcombe and Tombs, Ltd., have done
well in reprinting this abridged Collins, and
at the price of 7s. 6d. it will now be possible
for many to read a story which is full of
interest to every Australian. No later his-
torian of the period can have the same
charm as the narrator who was on the spot
when the first white men settled down to
conquer the Australian bush. An isolated
community of little more than a thousand,
mostly convicts and mostly males, sur-
rounded by unknown dangers, and often face
to face with starvation, could not fail to
furnish incidents of an extraordinary charac-
ter. Drink was almost the only diversion.
Rum became more precious than the waters
of Pactolus, and was the principal “ meejum
of exchange.” Collins tells a story about
a man named Williams, who lost his wife
and child in the harbor, and buried the
bodies within a few feet of his own door.
The profligacy of this man manifested itself in
a strange manner. A short time after he had thus
buried his wife Ire was seen sitting at his door
with a bottle of rum in his hand, and actually
drinking one glass and pouring another on her
grave until it was emptied, prefacing every liba-
tion by declaring how well she had loved it during
her life. He appeared to be in a state of insanity,
as this anecdote certainly testifies.
The convict in primitive conditions reverted
to an ancient practice ; but Collins was im-
pressed only by the waste of good rum.
Phillip was a man of great energy and
prudence, and, as a gaoler, far more humane
than most of his time. His treatment of
the convicts was gentle compared with thfe
System of later days. These, for instance,
were mild punishments:
One of the criminals was condemned to suffer
death ; another to be burned in the hand and im-
prisoned 12 months ; two were banished to Nor-
folk Island ; and three to stand in the pillory, to
which their ears were to be nailed. These last,
affording something like amusement to the mob,
were sufficiently covered with dirt and rotten
eggs. ... It may be some relief to turn from
the contemplation of such iniquity, though it
should be only to the transactions of savages dif-
fering from these wretches but in complexion.
The blacks interested Collins a good deal,
and his account of their manners and
customs is still of great value. His book is
also the sole authority for the famous
voyage' of Bass and Flinders.
The reprint of The English Colony in
N.S. W. (copy of which we have received
from Angus and Robertson) has a useful
preface and some notes by James Collier. It
would have been more valuable if it had been
provided with an index.
A Soldier of Fortune
S. P. Hyatt, whose latest novel, Black
Sheep , was greatly helped by the British
Library censors, tells the story of his life in
The Diary of a Soldier of Fortune (Sydney
Book Club). According to the title-page he
has had experience as “engineer, sheep-
station hand, nigger-driver, hunter, trader,
transport-rider, labor agent, explorer, lec-
turer, pressman, American soldier, blockade-
runner- and tramp.” The occupations are
sufficiently varied, no doubt; but, in point
of number, are not to be compared with the
lists of some of our Abo. contributors. Hyatt
has worked some of these experiences into
his previous books, where they appear to
better advantage than in this over-long and
formal autobiography. Nevertheless, The
Diary is a human document of value. Hyatt
has seen the seamy side of many places and
has put the acid on all sorts of men. <He
has fought with his brains for a living and
fought with a gun for fun; he has been
cheated many times, been euchred by For-
tune, faced by Death, and survived over 80
attacks of malarial fever. It is not surpris-
ing that he comes out of it with a rather
jaundiced view of men and things.
Hyatt arrived in Sydney in a sailing ship
(he does not say when) and was duly im-
pressed by the Beautiful Harbor. “I have
seen many harbors since then, but I think
the only ones which excel Sydney are Dar-
es-Salaam, “the Place of Peace,” in East
Africa, and Nagasaki.” He was in Sydney for
a fortnight, and remembers chiefly the larri-
kins and the fan-tan shops ! A big sheep
station, 400 miles up-country, was a fine
place, splendidly kept up, etc. — “ yet some-
how I cannot say that station life made any
great impression on me; certainly it never
appealed to me. Even so far up-country as
that there was little suggestion of the back-
blocks, and no hint at all of the Australia of
the novelists. It was all quite prosaic and
quite proper.” Australia is used to criticism,
and this hunk from a very brief experience
is another instance of the way in which the
country suffers from the results of our
visitors’ defective education :
Australia to-day seems entirely devoid of the
element of Romance. Possibly the same can be
said of any prosperous country, for excitement
means insecurity and dislocation of trade. On
the other hand, it does seem rather remarkable
that practically all the successful Australian
stories of adventure should have dealt with vio-
lent crime of the bushranger type. Nowadays
those who would have been bushrangers a few
decades ago, who are still bushrangers in spirit,
find a safer and more remunerative field for their
energies in politics.
Hyatt, apparently, knew no more about
Australia when he arrived than what he had
gathered from Ned Kelly, the Iron-dad
Bushranger or similar fffirillers, and his notion
of romance is that of the butcher boy or the
servant girl.
Anyhow, dismayed by the absence of pro-
miscuous violence and blood-letting, also by
the tedium of never-ending “race-horse
talk” on the station, he quitted Australia
and tried S. Africa. His experiences there
were not much happier; but he was
afterwards joined by a brother, Amyas,
who helped him to stop the rot. Every-
thing resolved itself into unmitigated
animalism there. “ Every Afrikander who
was my guest in those trading days
did me a bad turn, or tried to do me
one,” and the greed of speculators was re-
sponsible for four-fifths of the numerous
deaths at the mines. Drink brought on
malaria, and malaria made men drink, and
men died like flies. He had no love for
Cecil Rhodes or the Boer ; even the alleged
“king of beasts” he thought a mean and
slinking pest; and after seven years’ hard
work, sickness and bad luck, making money
and losing it, he left Rhodesia—dead broke.
It was not all bad : he met a few good
men like Dr. Koch ; but “ the curse of the
African tradition ” had settled on the land
and sapped the strength of the people.
I loved the road—Heaven knows I love it still,
for its own sake and also for the sake of Amy as,
who was my partner on the road, who understood
it as L did, heard its call as clearly as I did—but
the road, our road, is gone. That abominable
railway has replaced it. or rather displaced it,
and the Romance of Rhodesia is dead. Men
make money there now by orthodox occupations,
die decently in hospitals of delirium tremens, or
phthisis, or typhoid, and have the burial service
read over them by a Clerk in Holy Orders, which
must be comforting to their relatives. They have
coffins where we used blankets ; they have cash
where we signed “good-fors”; they drink a
bottle of locally-brewed lager—ghastly stuff—
where we got through a case of whisky. They
have succeeded where we failed, and I am not
sure that their success is not due to the fact that
we did fail after having done the rough work for
them.
His experiences elsewhere were not more
fortunate. The best view of Mauritius, he
says, is obtained from a ship—when the ship
is going away. The Filipinos are greasy
little) savages, and the civil administration
of the Philippines abominable. He admired
the American soldiers with whom he fought,
but “ whenever the civil department touch
the service they leave a dirty mark.” The
canteen was abolished, with the result that
“ crime in the service was more than
doubled, whilst the death rate went up in
almost the same degree.”
The S. African contingent of fiction-
writers is swelling visibly, and a number of
them have struck oil in Britain, though no-
thing of first-rate quality has appeared since
Olive Schreiner’s Story of an A frican Farm.
Cynthia Stockley’s Poppy began in the same
way : but proceeded in the manner of Marie
Corelli. The Shidamite and The Rod of
Justice (Dymock's), by A. and C. Askew,
are dramatic tales of average merit. Ger-
trude Page has extracted a good deaf of
simple humor from Rhodesian life in Love and
the Wilderness and three or four other stories.
Her work, however, is poor in style. The
latest and longest story of the veldt and the
rooinek is The Dop Doctor by Richard
Dehan (Dymock’s). Like Poppy and The
Story of an African Farm, it begins with a
cruelly ill-used white girl ; but the principal
character is the doctor. Driven out of
London by a miscarriage of justice, he takes
to drink to drown his sorrows, and is re-
deemed in the good old way. The story
is one that holds the reader’s interest
at the beginning, and allows it to be dissi-
pated by a multiplicity of characters and
undue length. The coincidences are too
numerous ; but there is much crude power
in the yarn, which out-weighs its faults.
_—
L. J. Vance has made a light and amusing
story of The Fortune Hunter, based on a
comedy of the same name by Winchell
Smith. It is of the same class as Brewster’s
Millions, though the plot runs in the opposite
direction. The humor of the American city
man has a fair show, and the mixture of
business and sentiment is very judicious.
Frederic Manning
Manning, a Sydney native, took a high
place as a prose writer when he published
Scenes and Portraits last year. An earlier
volume of blank verse, The Vigil of Brun-
hild, showed cleverness in the control ,of a
difficult measure ; but was not remarkable.
A new volume of Poems (Murray) contains
better blank verse and a number*of lyrics
which, though they do not say anything new,
say it exceedingly well. Here is a passage
from a rhymed version of the chase of Hip-
polyta by Theseus which has all the ardency
of Swinburne :
Theseus followed his prey
As a lean hound follows the fleet
Quarry: the dusty way
Smoked with the speed of, his feet.
She was swift; but he burned in the chace;
He was flame, he was sandalled with fire,
Hungering after her face,
With a fury, a lust, a desire,
As a hound that whines for the blood
Of the hart flying winged with fear.
And she yearned, and she longed for the wood,
Seeming far from her still, though near,
And she strained and she panted and pressed,
With her head flung backward for breath,
And the quick sobs shaking her breast,
Agonised, now, as by death,
Fearing utterly and fighting with fate,
Stumbling. And swifter behind,
With a love made hot by his hate,
Strained he, pursuing. ...
A long poem on “Helgi of Lithend ” has
more than one resemblance to Tennyson.**
So, all day long, the uncertain combat flowed,
Between the grey bents and the broken ground
is very close to these lines from “The Passing
of Arthur ” :
So, all day long, the noise of battle roll’d
Among the mountains by the winter sea.
While recalling earlier writers in their tone
and cadence, the following lines front the
same poem give a better measure of his
accomplishment:
He never knew
The keen, sweet joy that smites through every
sense
Into the shuddering soul, and whelms the world
In an immortal glory, while God builds
Life beyond us, creating out of clay
The world’s imperishable dream, the hope,
The wonder, the desire, that gives us sight
Beyond our mortal doom. I have little wit;
I only know that in the looms of time
God’s will moves like a shuttle to and fro.
I have heard him in the waves and on the wind ;
I have seen his splendor shine among the swords,
Soften the eyes of women, light and smile
On a child’s lips; and know his presence there
Where all the waves stream eagerly to lick
The sunset’s bloody splendors.
“An April Dance-Song” is skilfully
fashioned. One .stanza will suffice :
April, with her fleet, sweet,
Silver rain, and sun-rays,
Cometh, and her feet beat
Lightly, on the lawn.
Softly, for her sake, break
Flowering the wet boughs;
By the brimming lake, wake
Lilies every dawn.
The short lyrics give ample proof of Man-
ning’s metrical dexterity, and some of them
are charmingly sweet and simple. “ Reve-
nants des Enfants ” will do as well as any
for illustration :
Hoftlyv on little feet that make no sound,
With laughter that one does not hear, they tread
Upon the primroses that star the ground.
Latticed by shade from branches overhead,
Swaying'in moonlight ; but their footsteps make
A twinkling like the raindrops on the lake.
The shy things that love silence and the night
Are fearless at their coming ; as they pass.
Neither the nightingale nor owl take flight,
So gentle is each footfall on the grass ;
They are a part of silence, and a part
‘Of sweetness sprung from tears hid in the heart.
There is enough in this book to show that
Manning has a poetical nature with a power
of expression which would carry him far if
he could forget his reading.
War—and Poetry
It is perfectly true that blood is the only
permanent ink, and that a mixture of our
own and the enemy’s is essential for the
writing of patriotic poetry. But it is not
true that our poets are justified in writing in
rose-water, pending the Japanese invasion.
There is always plenty of blood handy for
the true poet; he has only to jab his nib
deep enough into himself. It hurts, of
course; but that is a detail.
It is an heroic pose—this indignant protest
that we have the divine Spark in lis, but that
it refuses to flare up in a poisonous environ-
ment of great morning dailies, Royal Art
Society pictures, clerical controversies, and
average aldermen. Very heroic—-to each
little inch of humble admirers : very stupid
to the educated Australian who knows that
Australians have—at stray intervals —written
in their own blood, and wonders why they
do not dip their nibs more freely.
Lacking battlefields, surely there still re-
mains something to goon with. The primal
emotions of humanity, earth and sea and
sky are all ours, yet Conventional Criticism
persists that the roots of our imagination
starve fo£ lack of a little bone-and-blood
fertilizer. The cannibalistic instincts of
local genius have not yet been glutted. Do
we venture to suggest that E. A. Poe
flamed to immortality in an atmosphere as
raw and depressing as ours, we are crushed
with the statement that he was an obvious
by-product of the Boston Tea Party.
That his imagination had lapped blood is
nowhere more evident —we are told—than
in his loveliest of love-lyrics, “Annabel
Lee.” Conventional Criticism is in some
doubt as to whether the poet derived that
musical name from “Hannibal,” “Anno
Belli,” or just plain “Cannibal”; the
“ Lee,” however, was obviously a prophetic
tribute to the great Southern leader, born
some years later. As to the heroine herself,
we must understand that she was either a
vivandiere of dubious parentage (“ high-born
kinsmen ”), or—possibly—a famous mare of
the strain of Mars—by George Washington,
out of Bunker’s Hill, from War of Inde-
pendence. Perhaps Conventional Criticism
will now tell us whence Jtioderic Quinn
derived the inspiration of “ The Camp
Within the West ” —perhaps our most beau-
tiful stray flower of verse, in its perfect
inter-dependence of emotion and form. Did
he derive it from the “ Eureka Stockade,”
or—further back still—from the tribal wars
of the aborigines ?

and will be paid at space rates. Meanwhile, one
wonders why Dowell O’Reilly does not dip his
nib in himself more freely.]

Mrs. Parkinson, of the Bundemar Hotel, Trangle, writes
about Clements Tonic thus :
“I wish to inform you of benefits derived. I suffered much from
indigestion. No medicines did me good. Your tonic, of which I
took a course of eight bottles, cured my ailments. I was run down,
could not eat or sleep, had pains all over, did not care if I lived or
died. I could not sit behind a horse for nervous fears. Now I
can drive a trap and pair. We keep an hotel, and my customers
remark what a DIFFERENT WOMAN I AM, and I tell them I
have to thank Clements Tonic for the good it did me.
“ (Signed) FRANCES N. PARKINSON.”
———■ —♦
Various professional persons recommend this tonic because it is pregnant with
those properties which rebuild the constitution. Nurses associated with some of the
largest institutions in the Commonwealth have written in terms of appreciation of its
beneficial effects upon convalescent patients. That it helps Nature to regain her
strength is undoubted.
This testimony shows what a health-restorer this medicine is, and what years of strength and
health anaemic women'may enjoy through its use. It relieves biliousness, sick headache, weakness,
low spirits, loss of appetite, poor blood, wasting diseases, constipation and indigestion. It lengthens
women’s lives, and gives them years of happiness. All chemists and stores sell it in Australia.

the “TYPHOID FLY”
DANGEROUS DOMESTIC PEST.
This is our well-known domestic pest—the
common house fly. In addition to being a typhoid
carrier, the fly may carry nearly all the intestinal
diseases and is the prime agent in the spread of
summer dysentery, being ifi this way unquestion-
ably responsible for the death of many children
in summer. The fly also possesses importance as
a disseminator of the bacilli of tuberculosis the
danger of human infection from tubercular flv
specks being by the ingestion of the specks
on food.
It is a startling thought that a person who
drinks a cup of tea or a glass of milk into which a
fly has fallen may take into his system 1,250,000
bacilli of typhoid, dysentery or tuberculosis.
Summing up the position, the typhoid or house
fly is a general or common carrier of pathogenic
bacteria. It may carry typhoid fever, Asiatic
cholera, dysentery, cholera morbus and other
intestinal diseases. It may carry the bacilli
of tuberculosis and certain eye diseases. It
is everywhere present, and it is disposed

The Importance of Being Me.
I am a speck upon a world
That’s but a microbe to the sun ;
Which, in the halls of boundless space.
Doth like a flying cinder run ;
Yet am not humbled at my fate ;
It s not my fault at any rate.
It only makes me feel some pride
When I review the countless suns
lliat spread the heavens on every side;
I hey re mine—as much as anyone’s;
And in their magnitude I see
I he great import of being me.
Through all my life (and I as long
Have lived as most men of my age)
I’ve held the fancy isn’t wrong
(Tn fact, I think it rather sage)
That if my being didn’t be
These things would not exist—for me.
The world exists because I live
Upon it, and I know it’s here ;
The sun I recognition give
Because I see its shining sphere ;
About the stars I worry not,
I simply take them in a lot. ’
This world concerns me most of all,
lor me built up through centuries ;
And yet in no wise I feel small.
Because it has a myriad nle’s.
I know all things I know or see
Are only there because of me.
Here kings may sit on thrones of State,
And Wade may boss a Parliament;
Some men endeavor to be great;
My landlord tries to get his rent.
As far as I’m concerned they do
Just what my mind gives knowledge to.
For all the difference it makes.
The stars, two-up, the sun and Wade,
Kings, beggars, cities, meat and calces,’
Books and religion, sport and trade—
The whole show, with its details fine,
May only be a dream of mine.
I know some people take great care,
By writing books and every wav, *
To prove that everything is where.
And just exactly what, they say ;
I hey do, because I know they do :
But them I may imagine, too.
I am not troubled at my size.
If everything means anything.
Subject 'to what I know it lies,
And I of what I know am king.
I see, in everything I see,
The great import of being me.

Gifts of the Deep.
Fisherman, fisherman, blithe and gav.
Light of heart as a man could wish,
What is the gift of the deep to-day—
-1 Dregs of the sea or goodly fish ? ”
Hauling his net with brave, brown hands,
Never an answering word makes he,
Sunk to his knees in the yielding sands,
Washed and wet by the break o’ the’sea.
Ever and ever the dancing floats
Near the shore as he sings and pulls ;
White of sail are the fishing boats,
White of wing the gathering gulls.
Coil on coil in a wet brown heap,
The long line lies on the beach behind,
Hung with weeds from the under-deep.
Shoreward sent by the shouting wind.
Hoisted high upon spread, grey wings,
Sea-hawks wheel in the drowsy noon ;
Joy in his throat, a bush bird sings,
1 hrilling the trees in their mid-day swoon.
“ Fishermen, yours is the task of all,
Nets are cast in a thousand seas ;
Hand over hand, day-long we haul,
Hope at the heart, or ill at ease.
“ Into the deep we cast our nets
(Dreaming, it may be, of glowing gain);
Out of the deep we dredge regrets,
Joy that dwindles and lasting pain.
“ Yet, brown folk o’ the sea have said
Chance, the giver, may send a pearl.
Yon is a lad with lifted head ;
Yon, and nigh him, a golden girl.
“Sunset burned when they hauled their net
(0, but the gods were kind above !)
There, on the beach, it shone sea-wet
Pearl of all pearls—the pearl of love.
“Strong man, true to your task, well done ! ”
Slowly the gift of the sea comes in
Fish that plunge in the light of the sun,
Flutter of tail and flash of fin.
Pulsing, leaping and all a-thrill,
Silver and grey, and bronze and bright,
Gouting the noon with crimson gill.
How they gleam in the golden light!
“Fisherman, fisherman, blithe and gay,
How shall the gods regard my wish ?
What shall I draw from the Deep to day,
Dregs of the sea or goodly fish ? ”

THE AUSTRALIAN NOTES BILL.
In some respects the FiSHKIi, Government’s Aus-
tralian Notes Bill is a grievous disappointment to
those who had pinned their faith to the new
regime. The scheme for an issue of Federal
paper money is one which might have been made
to serve several valuable purposes quite different
from the very humble purpose of raising a little
casual revenue to go on with. It might have
been a means to extend the power and influence
of the Federal authority almost indefinitely. It
might also have served to obliterate, in course of
time, the gigantic debts of the States. If the
proceeds of the paper money issue were
applied exclusively to the establishment of
a sinking fund the gradual obliteration
of the State debts would start immediately.
Also the extension of the Federal influence would
start immediately, for every year would bring the
Commonwealth nearer to the position of the
State Governments’ chief creditor. If war came
when the sinking fund had accumulated to, say,
£100,000,000, and the interest which the Com-
monwealth collected from the State Governments
had risen to, say, £3,500,000 a year, it would
always be possible to make a bonfire of the State
securities on hand, suspend sinking fund pro-
ceedings till the war was over, and tiius make an
extra £3,500,000 a year available for defence
without levying a penny of extra taxation. War
would be the only possible excuse for such an
action, but in war time almost anything is ex-
cusable. If the war made loans inevitable, the
wiping diit; by the mere application of a match,
of the £100,000,000 or any other amount of old
debt represented by the sinking fund would make
the raising of new loans so much the easier. Thus
it follows that if the available proceeds of the
note issue were applied to sinking-fund purposes
they would constitute a means for the extension
of the Federal power, a means for the removal of
the public-debt incubus, a possible war-chest, and a
fund at the back of the Federal paper money
which would make it the best-secured note issue
on earth—better secured by far than that of the
Bank of England. And if, instead of merely
providing for & note circulation, the Government
were to require the banks, as in Canada, to
hold 40 per cent, of their cash reserves in Federal
paper, and applied the proceeds of that much
more extensive scheme to sinking-fund purposes,
it would get more money and could do all these
things in a still more effective fashion.
* * * *
Unfortunately, none of these things seem likely
to be done. -1 he gold obtained in exchange for
1 ederal notes is to be ‘‘expended for any pur-
pose that the Parliament directs ” ; but though
the Government majority, which in this easels
Parliament for all the purposes of the Act, pro-
bably has its purpose already in view, it doesn’t
take the community into its confidence on the
matter. The money may go into some interest-
producing investment, or it may not. But if it,
or any part of it, goes into an interest-producing
investment, the revenue is to drift into the Trea-
sury and become part of the ordinary Federal
income. That reduces the business to a mere
revenue-gaining device, and all its other possible
elements of usefulness go overboard.
* * * *
When there is no Government-owned bank with
a wide system of branches for the issue of Federal
notes, it becomes necessary to circulate them
through the private banks. At this point the
first difficulty comes in. Canada solved the
problem very simply. It really doesn’t care
much whether its notes circulate or not, but it
enacts that out of every £5 of cash reserves held
by the banks, at least £2 must be Federal paper.
That amount represents the paper money which
doesn’t circulate at all and isn’t intended to, and
as it doesn’t get worn out by passing from hand
to hand, it costs little for maintenance. In ad-
dition, the banlcs, in making payments, must
give out a certain proportion of the money
in Government notes (of no specified denomi-
nation) if the payee so demands. The re-
sult is a certain circulation of Dominion paper
among the public, and a large steady holding
of Dominion paper by the banks—a holding which
can’t come back on the Treasury in a heap with a
sudden demand for cash. Queensland didn’t aim,
like Canada, at making the banks hold a large
proportion of notes in reserve, but merely pro-
posed, as the Fisher Government does, to create
a circulation among the people. Its method was
simple and effective. Every bank may obtain
from the Government paper money equal to one-
third of its capital. The money received from
any bank in exchange for paper is put on fixed
deposit with the same institution at 2 per cent,
interest. The note money represents the cheapest
deposit the banks have, and the one that is least
liable to be called for ; therefore they want Govern-
ment notes—as many of them as they are allowed
to have. If the Government, instead of using the
money derived from this system as revenue, had
applied it to sinking fund purposes the idea,
though far inferior to that of Canada, would have
been a fair success all round.
* * * *
The Fisher Government adopted neither of
these schemes, but resorted instead to a rather
crude method which is set forth in Clause XI of
the Bill as follows :
(IX) If the payee so demands, a bank, when making any
payment, shall make the payment in Australian Motes,
and in the denominations asked for by the payee.
Penalty Five Pounds.
Nothing in this section shall compel a bank to pay
more than Twenty-five Pounds in Australian Notes in any
one payment.
About the payment in Australian notes there can
be no objection, but the payment in any possible
kind of notes is a different matter. It is
set forth in Clause VI of the Bill that Aus-
tralian notes are to be issued in amounts of
10s., £l, £5, £lO and “any multiple of £10”
which presumably means twenties and fifties.
In these circumstances the amount in notes which
the Bill professes to require that a bank shall
keep on hand in order to be prepared to meet one
£25 cheque would be £ll5 worth, made up as
follows :
50 notes of 10s. each .. .. £25
25 ~ ~ £1 ~ .. .. 25
5 ~ ~ £5 ~ .. .. .25
2 ~ ~ £lO ~ .. .. 20
Incite ~ £2O .. ... 20
• £ll5
With nothing less than that could the bank feel
sure that it could meet a £25 cheque in the
manner that the Bill prescribes. And if the cus-
tomer was liable to make an unexpected demand
for gold, and w'as a customer whom it would be
impolitic to disoblige, that would raise the re-
serve against a £25 cheque to £l4O. Something
of this was suggested to Prime Minister Fisher,
and he replied that if a real difficulty could be
proved the Bill might be altered to read that
every cheque of £25 or under would be payable
on demand in either 10s., £1 or £5 Federal notes
only. An amendment of the sort would certainly
ease the strain a little ; yet even under these con-
ditions this would be the safe legal reserve against
a £25 cheque :
50 notes of 10s. each .. .. £25
25 ~ „ £1 ~ .. .. 25
5 „ ~ 15 ~ .. .. 25
£75
And if it was advisable, as a matter of policy, to
have £25 in gold, in case an influential customer
asked for that “ meejum of exchange,” the reserve
against the £25 cheque would be £loo—£7s to
comply with the law, and £25 more to prevent
possible loss of business.
Most cheques that are cashed across the bank
counter are comparatively small, so this difficulty
would be liable to strike the bulk of the business.
And in Australia branch banks are numerous, so
the difficulty might arise at many places. The
case of the Commercial Bank of Australia may be
taken as a possible sample. Its last balance-sheet
showed that it had £1,266,127 of cash in the
Commonwealth. It does business at one head
office and 246 branches and agencies—247
establishments in all. If the money was
equally divided there would be £5126 available
for each office, and that amount can’t stand
any excessive strain. The Commercial of Aus-
tralia has £3,006,562 of deposits that are liable to
be called for at any moment (this is quite apart
from about £2,500,000 of fixed deposits, which are
periodically maturing). If an institution is
allowed to pay, say, half in gold and half in
any kind of notes that happen to be handy,
then in ordinary times £1,266,127 of legal
tender (whether the same be gold or Government
notes) is a superabundance to hold against
£3,006,562 of immediate liabilities and £2,500,000
of periodically maturing liabilities. But if the bank
is required to be ready to meet sudden demands in
three or four or five or even six different
forms of currency, the situation becomes exceed-
ingly precarious. The bank, if it wants to do
business, must accept a customer’s £25 current
account deposit in silver or gold, or 10s. or £1 or
£5 notes, or it must be content to take part of it
in £lO notes or in a £2O note. Yet if the law says
that it must be prepared to pay out the whole £25
in any one of three or five different forms, then
the law demands that it shall keep on hand more
money than it receives.
* * * *
In the circumstances, it is probable that the
best thing the Government can do is to throw
its Australian Notes Bill overboard root and
branch, and start afresh with the Canadian
sj'stem as its model. By so doing it will get
much more money and get it at much less trouble.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Recent Visit to Canberra.
A party of Senators has been visiting the pro-
posed Canberra Federal capital site at the
public expense, and it received full permis-
sion to also visit the old Dalgety site at its
own expense, if it lelt so inclined. The trip
happened after a period of rain, and things
were looking a trifle better than usual. Senator
McDougall fell into the Murrumbidgee, a river
which is reserved by the N.S.W. State Govern-
ment for the supply of the Barren Jack reservoir;
and the fact that there was enough water to wet
Senator McDougall in this river, which the
inhabitants of the Federal territory are not to be
allowed to use, is advanced as evidence that
there is an abundant water supply in the pro-
posed Federal territory. The Cotter, in flood, was
described by the Herald as “ never more than
20ft. wide,” yet the Senators are alleged by the
Sydney Tory press to have marvelled greatly
over it. -L he Cotter seems to be an unlucky river
somehow. Statistician Knibbs, in his “ Year
Book No. 2,” gives nearly nine closely-printed
pages, or nearly 18 closely-printed columns, to
the enumeration of the rivers of the Common-
wealth, and even includes a Queensland creek
two miles long; yet he doesn’t so much as men-
tion the Cotter, the Faddy or the Naas—the
streams on which the Federal city and
territory are to depend. Perhaps he saw them in
a dry time. Certainly Knibbs ought to be spoken
to severely about his failure to realise the exist-
ence of these rivers. Attorney-General Hughes
made the visit an opportunity to explain
that the arrangement by which the Federal
port stops at high-water mark, and, ex-
cept for about half an hour per day,
doesn’t even touch the water, really means
nothing. There will be no difficulty about letting
the Federal Government have the use of the
shore and the water; and the refusal of tne
N.S.W. State Ministry to define the territory as
extending down to low-water mark, and includ-
ing the use of the water beyond, only proves the
frank and untrammelled desire of the N.S.W.
State Ministry that the Commonwealth shall
have and use the whole shore and the adjacent
water. So far as can be gathered from the Sydney
morning press, the idea that there is anything
absurd in having the Federal capital territory in
two fragments about 100 miles apart, and one of
the fragments well inside the legal 100-miles limit
from Sydney, has been wholly dissipated by the
Senatorial visit and the fact that Mr. McDougall
fell overboard in a State river. The lamentable
scarcity of the local rainfall, as shown at the
adjacent town of Queanbeyan, which has the
poorest record, bar one, in all the coastal and
tableland districts of N.S.W., is also wiped out by
the fact that Senator McDougall, after a wet
spell, got very damp in the Murrumbidgee, quite
outside the proposed Federal water supply area.
In fact, the Congested Population party, which
wants to put the capital as close as possible to the
biggest city in Australia, so that it will do nothing
whatsoever towards peopling the great empty
spaces, professes to have been enjoying a great
time. Yet it is as solid as ever about the inad-
visability of letting the people decide the Federal
capital question, and no such thing as a Refer-
endum looms on the farthest horizon. There
seems to be among the Canberra push a dreadful
fear of a Referendum. The Bulletin would
gladly submit its view of the case to a popular
vote, inasmuch as its view isn’t based on a hurried
visit to ’Berra immediately after a heavy down-
pour; but Hughes and his friends shirk the ques-
tion in a curious way, as if they felt that their
story couldn’t stand public inspection.
_
Throe Famous Cases, and Some Distinctions
Between Them.
“ Lex”
It, is significant that the subjects on which “Liber-
alism ” in N.S.W. is moat touchy are (1) the McKyk case,
(2) the Coercion Act. “Liberalism ” doesn’t attempt to
seriously defend either of these unpleasantnesses. In-
stead, whenever either of them is reproachfully hurled at
it by a Labor-sympathiser, it cries tu quoque, and falls
back in disorder on the Friedman case. The line of
argument taken is that B. R. Wise, as Minister for
Justice in the See Administration, released Friedman
after the latter had been found guilty by a jury ;
that thereby British justice was flouted quite as flag-
rantly as it was in the cases of McKye and Bowling ;
that the Labor party omitted to fling Wise out of office’
for freeing Friedman—which is to say it condoned his
act, which is to say it should be held equally responsible
with Wise. There are fallacies in the above reasoning,
however. For instance, the cases of McKyk and Fried-
man differ. Both were convicted, both were handed
legal punishment, and both had that punishment, or part
of it, remitted. But McKye, who enjoyed the clemency of
Wade, was a second offender. And not only was the Judge
who tried his case notconsulted when it was reviewed, but
it is known that he was horrified at the Wade Govern-
ment’s conduct in the matter. In the case of Friedman
the initiative wasn’t taken by the See Government. The
Judge before whom that much-discussed Hebrew ap-
peared, himself wrote to the Attorney-General after the
jury returned its verdict, pointing out in strong terms
that justice had miscarried. Nor is there the least doubt
in the public mind but that it had. About the worst
offence a Minister for Justice could commit in such cir-
cumstances would have been to keep Friedman in gaol—
the Judge who heard his case having expressly reported
him to be innocent.
Again, there is a large hole, not to say a gaping chasm,
in the contention that “ the sacred principle of trial by
jury ” was as flagrantly violated by the release of Fried-
man as it was by the gaoling of Bowling. It is the
healthy practice of British law to look with a most
tolerant eye on the freeing of an accused person, while it
regards, with the greatest hostility, the frivolous gaoling
of anyone. A brand new law was invented by the Wade
Government before it was possible to get Bowling under
lock and key. As a result, Bowling went to prison, and
public opinion was so scandalised that amazed and out-
raged echoes sounded from as far away as the United
Kingdom.
No one was scandalised over the discharge of Fried-
man. The Colonial Office in London expressly com-
mended the step. The local Bar—-which recognises that
on the rare occasions when a Judge goes out of his way
to proclaim an accused person’s innocence, there is scant
doubt on the subject—was satisfied. The public, which
knew the Judge concerned in the matter for an able and
reputable official, hadn’t a word to say in protest.
The basic distinction between the cases of Bowling
and Friedman is the distinction that lies between
lightly sending a man to gaol and more or less lightly
taking him out of it. The average man isn’t
wildly interested in the merits of the case when he
learns that a Friedman has been unloosed ; on general
principles, he reckons it is all to the good. But he is apt
to be wildly interested, likewise alarmed, when he sees a
man whom one of his Judges acclaims as a person with
whom he (the Judge) would be proud to shake hands,
transformed into a gaol-bird, as it were by a stroke of the
legislative pen. Spectacles of that sort make perfectly
respectable and harmless people ponder apprehensively
as to whose turn it may be next. And the outcry against
coercive legislation, machine-made criminals and soon,
is swelled from all sorts of unexpected sources accord-
ingly.
♦
Continuation of the Profound Silence of
Gregory Wade.
It is advisable to ask, at suitable intervals, right
up to election day, if Mr. Wade, Premier of
N.S.W., will kindly emerge from behind his veil
of reticence, and cast aside the whole garment of
secrecy, and explaiti what he meant by certain
dark allusions re Peter Bowling and a Labor
member unspecified. One of Wade’s strongest
suits is his habit of heaving around murky allusions
concerning the horrible things he could tell about
this or that opponent if he only let himself go,
but no matter how lavishly the said opponent
urges Wade to let himself go, he only retires
behind an entrenchment of gloom, and hints that
the time may yet come. It never does come,
but he always hints. In the matter at
issue, Wade suggested, as one speaking
through a glass darkly, that if he re-
vealed the machinations of some Labor man or
other re Peter Bowling, the party would proba-
bly be covered with shame like an inverted
bucket of mud. In response to a clamor for par-
ticulars, he inferred, like the sun behind a cloud,
that he was chained to a policy of concealment.
Offers to release him from any possible or proba-
ble pledge of hiddenness or reticence only caused
him to wrap himself in the toga of his frayed dig-
nity, and retire within himself, and bang the
door of his great personality. But his faithful
follower, Fitzpatrick, was less secretive. He
declared that he knew all about it, and that the
fact was that Grahame, member for the coaly
town of Wickham, had urged Wade to make the
law under which P. Bowling was gaoled even
more strenuous than it is, in order, presumably, to
get P. Bowlinga longer term of gaol than he is now
serving. This charge suggested two possibilities
—one, that Fitzpatrick was telling a plain, un-
varnished falsehood ; and the other that lie was
telling the truth, and that Wade, the only man
from whom he could possibly have got the informa-
tion he said he possessed, had broken his pledge of
secrecy. Grahame flatly denied the charge, and
asked Wade if he dared to corroborate it. He
gave Wade a full and complete receipt for any
and every possible obligation to lie low or to lurk
behind the herb of ambiguity, and called on him
to come out in the open and say if he (Grahame)
had really done the thing charged against him.
Wade, who had started the whole trouble,
only enveloped himself more profoundly in
the tattered Kidderminster carpet of his
magnificent seclusion, and said, “Why drag
me into it?”—as if he hadn’t been in it
from the beginning. There the matter rests. It
gets no “forrarder.” Wade has declared that
he knows something horrible, but is bound not to
reveal it. Fitzpatrick says he knows the hor-
rible thing that Wade knows (Wade having
apparently broken his promise to keep the hor-
rible thing dark) and Fitzpatrick states it. The
accused person (Grahame) denies the alleged
horrible circumstance, discharges Wade, who
started the whole shindy, from any real or
imaginary obligation to keep silent, and asks
Wade to say whether he (Grahame) is a
liar, or whether Fitzpatrick is one, or
whether Wade is one himself. And as the
charge against Grahame was one of shameful
treachery he has every right to demand an ex-
planation. And all Grahame gets is a back view
of Waders he retires with a limited amount of
dignity into his tent. The trouble now is that if
Wade, goaded to fury, rises up in violent corro-
boration of Fitzpatrick he won’t command any-
thing like the credence he would have done if he
had corroborated Fitzpatrick on the spot. The
faded cloak of mystery is a failure when the cloak
is too short and it is worn too long.
A Remarkable Sinking Fund.
Further details are to hand about the great
sinking fund by which Joseph Ward proposes to
pay off the Maoriland public debt inside 75 years.
The idea was so utterly unlike Joseph that every-
body who knew him expected to find it loaded,
and these people are not disappointed. In the
first place, the sinking fund arrangement doesn’t
apply to quite all the debt. By some murky
process of " transfer” the Government has found
justification for paying off only £60,000,000 in-
stead of the actual £70,000,000 or £72,000,000.
Then the floating of new loans is to go on gaily as
per usual. These two matters being understood,
the actual sinking fund question comes on the
board. A certain sum—the amount which
the Controller and Auditor-General shall de-
clare to be necessary—is to be paid each
year to the sinking fund commissioners. Having
got the money in hand there seem to be
three courses naturally open to the commis-
sioners, though, curiously enough, they are to
take none of them. They might buy up some of
the new loan which Maoriland is going to issue
regularly as aforetime, though the proceeding
would be rather an absurd sort of business; but
as that would to some extent diminish the influx
of foreign cash on which Ward has built
his boom, it is not going to be done. Then
they might invest the money by taking up
part of the renewal loans which Maoriland has to
float every year, by reason of the beastly habit of
falling due with which the old loans are afflicted ;
but that would also be sending some money out
of the country, and Ward wants to keep all the
money in the country to boom with. So that
device is also ruled out. The Commissioners are
not even to buy up Government securities in the
open market. Joseph Ward’s really brilliant idea
is that the sinking fund money is to be invested in
loans to settlers, local bodies and so on, for terms
extending up to 40 years. And apparently it is
only when the money comes back from these loans
that the real repayment of the debt is to com-
mence. A scheme like that is liable to break
up rather badly. It is one thing to with
draw, say, £BOO,OOO a year from the country
and apply it to the repurchase of Maoriland
securities in England. It is quite another thing to
invest, say, £BOO,OOO every year for perhaps 25 years
in local land-booming, and then when there is
£20,000,000 or £2s,ooo,oooinvested in the boom to
try to get it out so as to pay off £20,000,000
or £25,000.000 of debt in a heap. The attempt to
realise £20,000,000 out of a big boom is more
likely to yield £40,00Q,000 worth of smash
than £20,000,000 of cash. The business is all a
juggle and a postponement. Ward himself is to
go on borrowing for productive works and unpro-
ductive works. He will probably borrow enough
for wholly unproductive works—the kipd which
should clearly be paid for out of cover
his payments to the sinking fund—in other words,
he will probably borrow the sinking fund money.
He will use the sinking fund to keep up his
boom, and years hence, when Ward is politicallv
gone, it will be someone eise's job to try and


extricate the hard cash out of the boom and start
making the actual repayments. A marvellous
financier is .T. Ward. His motto seems to be :
“ Things will last my time.”
Speeding Up.
Now that the Richmond smash has ensured some
sort of inquiry into the whole administration of
the Victorian railways, the harassed employees
are beginning to speak openly. The worst victims
seem to be the signalmen ; the Department’s set
policy appears to be to work them at what an
engineer would call the breaking strain, but only
to pay them on the ordinary working-strain basis.
Twelve consecutive hours in a busy signal-box
seems to be a common occurrence. One man tells
of having put in 15 hours daily for three consecu-
tive days, and he has had no respite for two years,
though two lots of annual holidays are long over-
due. In the busy boxes the man has the
assistance of a “recorder” —a boy allegedly
of 16 or over, though one is stated to be
only 14—whose duty is merely to make time
entries in the books. If he asks for a
qualified adult assistant he gets no immediate
reply, but is liable to find himself transferred to
some remote station in the Backbloeks, or “ad-
vanced” to the position of general laborer at
7s. 6d. a day. Wherefore he struggles on as long
as he can—or until the smash comes. Periodi-
cally an inspector wanders round and remarks
that the employees are somewhat slow—“ the
Department thinks they ought to be speeded up
a bit.” But the case of the hapless “fog signalmen”
is even worse. The Department doesn’t employ any
real fog signalmen; it expects porters on after-
noon duty to make themselves available at 6 a.m.
If there is a fog they go on duty from that hour
until 11 or 12 o’clock ; if not, they may return to
roost again. Figures are given, and depart-
mentally admitted to be correct, showing that
porters whose ordinary hours total 77 per week
have been frequently called on, after but three or
four hours’ rest, to take up another four hours’
spell of “fog ” duty; then they rest two hours, and
afterthathave totackleordinary toilonce more. Of
course these unfortunate porters are paid for their
extra toil, but they don’t get overtime rates.
They are paid for this special, extra-respon-
sible work just the ordinary porter’s wages.
In fact,'*if a fog signaller be, say, a night watch-
man doing 12 hours for 55., he gets only ss. for
12 hours’ fog signalling. This isn’t called sweat-
ing or slave-driving ; it is designated “speeding
up.” The porter doesn’t naturally work at a
breakneck pace, because even Tait hasn’t yet got
into a regular habit "of having two trains at one
platform at once, so the Department makes up
for the porter’s lack of swiftness by extending his
hours to 14 or 16 per day, at the usual rate of
pay. It will be remembered that when Tait,
who comes from a country where a 10-hour day
largely obtains, first reached Australia, he failed
to bestow his gracious approval on the eight-hour
system, but was, nominally at least, forced to
recognise it. It seems he has surreptitiously
undermined it, and has gone several hours better.
Only he calls it “speeding up.”

More “ Federal Interference.”
The Tasmanian Assembly, having given up all
hope of being able to successfully negotiate with
Wade’s Department of Agriculture, unanimously
resolved the other day to urge the Commonwealth
Parliament to take over the inter-State inspection
of fruit. Clause 112 of the Australian Constitu-
tion provides that a State may levy on imports
and exports “ such charges as may be necessary
for executing the inspection laws of the State.”
It is claimed, however, that N.S.W. Minister
Perry’s inspection fees are so high that their impo-
sition amounts toaserious tax on the produce-raising
citizens of other States ; and it is threatened that,
if the unfederal Wade Ministry is not effectively
dealt with by the Australian Government, legal
proceedings will be taken against it, in order to
find out whether one State can levy import duties
against another State by merely calling them in-
spection dues. Meanwhile, Wade’s Minister for
Agriculture, Perry, is sending frantic telegrams
to Tasmanian and other State authorities, urging
them to join with N.S.W. in “ resisting Federal
interference.” One such telegram was received
by Premier Lewis during the debate on this fruit-
inspection matter ; whereupon the Speck’s Assem-
bly expressed its utter disgust, and unanimously
decided that the Australian Government was to
be trusted to pursue codlin moth and fruit-fly
in a fair and effective manner, while the wretched
Wade Administration wasn’t.
Sydney’s 111-Regulated Harbor.
The marine worm—which is by no means the
same thing as the sea-serpent —has turned, and is
making a fearsome row about the inefficient
lighting of Sydney harbor. Men of the profession
of which Noaii was the oldest exponent clamor
for a perfectly new system of leading lights and
beacons, by careful attention to which a ship-
master can at least clear himself of all moral
responsibility when the collision takes place. He
will probably lose his certificate all the same, for
the old, leaky, dismasted Marine Court seems to
go on two simple principles : (1) If a master
breaks the rules and there is a collision he may be
passed out for breaking the rules ; (2) if he sticks
to the rules and there is a collision he may be
passed out for not “using his discretion”
or something like that. But even if the pro-
posed leading lights and beacons don’t supply
any mental illumination to the Court, it is
reckoned that they may do good in other ways.
Sydney Harbor, into which some unspeakable
fools want to herd the Australian navy in
addition to its other troubles, is a very crowded
spot for its size. Its entrance isn’t a patch on
Port Darwin for depth, nor is it so deep as the
channel that leads across Port Phillip to Port
Melbourne; still it is a very good entrance. Inside,
however, when the shallows and islands and the
great jutting point of Bradley’s Head are allowed
for, it isn’t so wildly commodious as is generally
supposed, and it is badly lighted and badly regu-
lated. It isn’t by any means a favorite with
shipmasters, who greatly prefer the unpictu-
resque but more easily navigated waste of
grey waters which leads to Port Melbourne.
Collisions are horribly frequent, especially
in the dangerous neighborhood of Bradley’s Head,
where vessels, trying to steer in every direction at
once in order to comply with all the varied decisions
recently given by the marine authorities, come
suddenly on each other round the corner, with
the result that the fairway is fast getting silted
up with lost certificates. The sudden clamor for
a new lighting system has roused to speech the
two powers which divide control of the port.
One of these, the Harbor Trust, says a new system
is most essential, and that it has been considering
the matter itself for quite a while. The other,
the Department of Navigation, reckons the idea
to be wholly unnecessary. But this latter body is
looked upon with a good deal of scorn by sea-
faring men, some of whom reckon it can’t even
mark a wreck properly. At times, their language
about it includes expressions that they wouldn’t
use to the ship’s cat. They would prefer to
throw the mouse-hunter overboard than smirch its
young mind with some of the things they say about
the blessed Department.
How the Vic. Railway Department Treats
Its Accident Cases.
A tale of the Victorian railways :
Long before the list of sufferers by the Richmond
smash was completed, the Vic. Railway Department
started doling out “ compensation ” to claimants whose
names and cases had been sent in. The Melbourne news-
papers announced this fact without comment, and doubt-
less a number of unreflecting readers thought that the
Department showed commendable promptitude. The
truth is that in thus hastening to settle with shocked
and damaged passengers, ere they can fully estimate, or
criticise the doctor’s estimate of, the possible results of
their damages and shocks, ihe Department is merely
aggravating its offence. No man knows, much less
a woman, how much injury he or she has suf-
fered from a railway accident which happened
only a week previously ; but the Railway policy
apparently is to employ medical officers for the
purpose of judging, not how much but how
little, the mutilated claimants may have been
harmed, and for the further purpose of advising the
patient to accept the compensation which the Department
offers. Obviously, the practitioners who act for the De-
partment are engaged to be optimists rather than pessi-
mists ; also they are interposed as much as is possible
between the patient and any outside medical adviser
whom the patient might prefer to accept as an authority.
But —and there is much significance in this but —if
another doctor be in possession of a railway accident case
before an official adviser comes upon the scene, he is
liable to be “approached” with a view to a small
and early settlement of the question of damages.
He is sworn in, so to speak, as a special settle-
ment-maker, even as outside citizens are enrolled as special
constables in cases of grave emergency. If he calls in
another practitioner for consultation, it is often one
or both of the Departmental nominees whom he sum-
mons. Mainly by means of this system of working settle-
ments, the A 7 ic. Railways were enabled to escape from
the consequences of the Sunshine disaster with alossof
little more than £lOO,OOO in compensations, though more
than 400 persons were injured and 47 killed—an average of
£2O to £3O for each claimant.
In the Sunshine case solicitor Woolf distinguished him-
self by claiming to represent the public in general
whilst appearing specially on behalf of killed and
injured clients. He then argued that, inasmuch
as everybody in Victoria was a possible future
victim of the railways, everybody should be protected
against future accidents. In exacting better terms for
his clients than the Department had offered, he en-
forced the argument that nobody, save possibly the Rail-
way Commissioners, desires to deal meanly with the
victims of a smash, seeing that where the passengers, as
members of the State, provide their own railways, liberal
self-compensation is the first law of nature if self-
preservation be impossible. Therefore, the name of
lawyer Woolf was anathema to the Department two
years ago. And he is in a similar position in this Rich-
mond disaster. He was instructed to take up the case
of a girl patient. After she had been taken home from the
Richmond smash-up a local doctor was called in to attend
her, and when in due course her brother asked Woolf to
look after her interests, the tactics of the Department
were glaringly exposed. In the first place, a leading
physician whom the lawyer commissioned to examine
the patient was “choked off” by the suburban doctor
in attendance, being told that the patient was practi-
cally quite recovered, and it was therefore unnecessary
to see her. Also the suburban doctor stated in an
authoritative tone that the physician “ wouldn’t get
paid ” if he did see her. The lawyer opened a corres-
pondence with the vigorous young doc. (who seemingly
had for the moment persuaded the sick, hysterical girl to
leave her case in his hands), and finally the lawyer’s
managing clerk went to interview him re his unsatisfactory
letter-writing and his policy of obstruction. The clerk
found him in telephonic communication with the Railway
Department, and making an appointment with a railway
official to come out —presumably to fix up a settlement.
Also, he stated that he was “ authorised to settle ” his
patient’s claim against the Department. How it comes
about that a patient’s doctor should take such a lively
interest in advising his patient—while he or she is still
hardly in a fit state to consider matters —to accept a
small sum from the Department and be done with the
business doesn’t appear very clear; but for some reason
or other there are doctors who do that sort of thing.
Therefore, any damaged railway traveller would be well
advised to have dark suspicions of his or her medico
should the latter show a desire to diverge from medicine
into the paths of finance—very small and prompt finance
that is.

The Coronation Swear.
In addition to the row at our doors about
King George V.’s oath of accession—and, in all
conscience, that local row is bad enough —we now
Begin to hear by cablegram of far-off holy disturb-
ances based on the same subject. They are much
the same as those to which we are accustomed in
Australia, and any one is a fair sample of the rest.
Let this item stand for the lot:
London, Thursday Afternoon.—The Protestant Truth
Society has protested against the new Accession Declara-
tion.
The society maintains that the new Declaration does
not provide against mental reservation and Papal dispen-
sation, and is only parallel with the oaths taken by
Charles 11., and James 11., which were ineffective.
Members of the society marched in procession to
Downing-street yesterday crying out, “No Popery!”
The police stopped the demonstration.
To the peaceful agnostic, who has given up all the
creeds and churches and clamors and confessions
and catechisms as things that are beyond human
comprehension, the most impressive feature of
this business is its awful futility. These No
dfopery people apparently hold with firmness to
the following propositions :
(1) That the Romish Church may authorise the King to
tell a lie by saying that he is a Protestant when he isn't
one.
(2) But if he is asked in addition whether the Romish
Church has authorised him to tell the above-mentioned
lie, the Church will be bowled out.
Any ordinary person might think that if the
Church authorised the King to tell a lie by
saying he wasn’t a Catholic, it might just
as easily authorise him to tell a second
lie by saying that he hadn’t been authorised
to tell the first lie. But these simple-minded
people seem to reckon that that is impossible.
It is certainly a complicated situation. Assum-
ing, as the old Coronation Oath certainly does
assume, that the British Sovereign is probably
a liar, and is likely to have taken the pre-
caution to obtain from Rome a permit, not
only to lie but also to shamelessly blaspheme
against the faith which in his heart he holds
sacred, it seems quite useless to administer
any oath at all. The sort of king who requires
that sort of oath to bind him is plainly the sort of
king with whom no oath has any value whatever.
Edward VII. took the old oath, yet he made no
objection when his niece turned Roman Catholic
and married a Catholic sovereign. Also, it has
been openly declared that he died a Catholic, and
it has been hinted that the new Queen has leanings
in that direction. This sort of suspicion is out of
the reach of any oath yet invented. In any case the
whole business is lamentably unsuited to British
conditions. The R. C. Church had a fairly
dreadful record in other countries, though
even in 1 Spain, where things were at their
.worst, the Inquisition only averaged 125
executions per annum, and seeing that the
tiny community of N.S. W. had in one single year
(1332) 82 executions, together with floggings in-
numerable, it can hardly complain. But in
Britain the Church of England, and not the
R. C. crowd, was the great historical persecutor.
There were persecutions directed against the
Reformers under Henry IV., Henry V.,
Henry VIII. (the founder, in a casual sort of
way, of the present Church of England) and
Mary. (The last-named, who was distinctly a
horror, averaged 71 executions per annum.)
But all these troubles covered a very few years all
told, while the persecutions of the Roman
Catholics of Ireland lasted for two centuries, and
the evils done in Ireland to secure the supremacy
of the English Church left the proceedings of
Alva in the shade. It was nine years after
the last semblance of the Inquisition was
blotted out before the Church of England
was forced by the secular authority to leave off
being an active persecutor. The Inquisition,
that old and utterly infamous institution, founded
by the Greek emperor Theodosius in 382, burst
its last boiler in 1820, yet it was not till 1829
that the Irish Roman Catholic ceased to rank, in
the eye of the law, with a horse or an ox. And it
was not till nearly 50 years after the complete
vanishment of the Inquisition (say about 1868 or
1870) that the Church of England ceased to
have people put in gaol for refusing to
contribute to its collection plate under the name
of “ church rates.” And quite a number of people
aren’t sure even to this day that the English
Church is Protestant. It holds itself coldly aloof
from assured Protestants, such as Methodists,
Presbyterians and Lutherans. It has a High
Church section which believes in altars, vest-
ments, candles and confession, and is suspected
of wearing a hair shirt next its skin. Certain
of the adherents of the Church of England
declare that it never broke away from Rome,
but that Rome broke away from it; and
they hold that their fane is to this day
the real old church of St. Peter and Gregory the
Great, with the name blown in the bottle, and all
others are spurious imitations. Even the most
vigorous swearing of allegiance to sueh a
dubious church seems a rather doubtful se-
curity against Catholicism. William 111.,
the first British sovereign who took the Corona-
tion Oath about which the trouble has arisen, was
a Dutch Protestant of undoubted integrity, and
had nothing in common with the halting, semi-
Catholie, semi-Protestant Tabernacle of England.
But George Y. isn’t of the old Dutch school.
Perhaps the surest method is to make him turn
Primitive Methodist or Salvationist. No one
ever suspected the Big Drum of any leanings
towards Rome.

The Duty of a Deteriorating Nation.
Foster Fraser, the shallow book-writer who
rushed along the beaten tracks of Australia on a
lecturing tour, and then returned to England to
put his impressions into print, has now taken up
a critical position half-way between the Devil and
the deep sea. His summing-up of the climatic
and human evidences of this country is anti-
Australian. His suggestion for delaying the
alleged deterioration of the Australian race,
which he professes to regard as inevitable, is dis-
tinctly anti-British., For whereas F. Fraser
maintains that the demoralising effects of climate
are visible in the third generation of Australian
descendants of European settlers, he advocates a
constant emigration of British and Irish to these
allegedly lowering latitudes in order to preserve
Australian virility. And he cheerfully states
that “circumstances will always bring to Aus-
tralia good material, producing a fine race.” In
short, the fatuous Fraser predicts and advocates
a steady withdrawal of persons from the cold
countries to a land where their stock, he says, is
bound to depreciate. This country, by Fraser’s
showing, will have a fine race for just as long as
the average quality of its inhabitants is main-
tained by a supply of virile immigrants. And, of
course, the larger the old decayed population on
hand, the more virile immigrants we will want to
boost things up. A time may come when
1,000,000 British and Irish per annum will only
just till the bill. Yet as long as Peter is robbed
on a big enough scale to pay Paul,
the latter will continue to be fat and
flourishing. By transferring the whole of
Peter’s substance—all the virile population of
Britain and Ireland—to Australian Paul,
the latter’s race would be made mighty fine and
large for one and even two generations; but in
the third generation it would deteriorate, and
what it would be like in the tenth generation the
Lord only knows. And only the Lord knows
what the Australians of the future would be like
if no more Europeans were to come along
and take part in the national deteriorating. This
is a problem which in the interests of man-
hood ought to be solved. Foster Fraser’s ideas
are an insult to the uatural law of the survival of
the fittest. Why leave this land of deterioration
open to virile foreign people? They should be
prohibited from emigrating to Australia. Foster
Fraser has pronounced our doom, and though it
be delayed it cannot be averted. Where the pro-
portion of deteriorating natives is steadily in-
creasing (by Foster Fraser’s dictum), the ab-
surdity of attempting to establish a fine race is
painfully obvious. Let us be content to put our-
selves in quarantine and paste a notice on the
padlocked gate: “ This country closed for in-
evitable deterioration.” It is the duty we owe to
humanity at large.

The Crab’s Progress.
.July 24 was celebrated by the Victorian churches
as Labor Sunday, when Labor aspirations and
ideals were dealt with by a large number and
variety of parsons. And the manner in which
these parsons walked, ran and skipped round
their subject, without ever attempting to catch
hold of it and examine it, bordered on the miracu-
lous. In many instances the fear of the rich man,
who supplies the bulk of the pew-rents, was pal-
pably the cause of this manoeuvring. In other
cases the failure to grasp the subject seemed to
arise simply from ineptitude. As a fair sample of
one very popular style of futile argument this is
given :
Modern Socialism said ... Give us favorable environ-
ment, good healthy food, good clothing and good houses
to live in, and you will see the improvement in the man ;
see what a better man he will be. The Christian religion
said this was the wrong way, and that they must begin
with a man’s heart, with his inner life, his convictions,
his conscience. If they thought they were going to raise
men in connection with their higher well-being merely
by different surroundings and by favorable conditions,
that was the grand mistake. That was the rock on which
modern Socialistic theories must be broken.
And when the parson calls for this mysterious
alteration in the “ heart” and the “inner life,”
he picks out the softest pillow he can, turns out
the light, and goes to sleep happy and satisfied
that he has done his duty. If environment
doesn’t matter, he might choose a brick for a
pillow, and tiirn up the light, and encourage a
dog to howl in his ear ; but where his own per-
sonal comfort is concerned he isn’t such an ass.
But while he is careful about his own surround-
ings in that way, it doesn’t occur to him that
men and women who are hungry and badly-
clothed are bad subjects forsesthetics and theology;
and that, from the parson’s point of view, their
hearts are proba,bly a minus quantity. And this
kind of parson never seems to think that, even if
the Socialists’ programme doesn’t rank high in
an ethical sense, it is a very fair foundation for
something better. Modern Socialism begins at
the beginning, and seeks to supply man’s first and
primitive needs—food and warmth. It believes
that, until these demands are met, it is no use
talking to the man about his “inner life”; in
fact, the Socialist says that there can be no sound,
sane inner life vvithout food and warmth. Also,
instead of blaming a man for wanting food, the
Socialist says that it is natural. But to all such
reasoning this kind of parson turns a deaf ear ;
and, in a voice full of stupidity, he calls on man-
kind to begin at the top and progress back-
wards and downwards. No house was ever
built from the top ; and the only animal that
progresses (so to speak) backwards is the crab,
and even it does not go straight backwards.
Whether this plea of the Church for attention to
the “inner life” at the outset is genuine is a
debatable question. It may be just a stall to save
the Church from running counter to the political
opinions of the rich members of the fold. If it is
genuine, then the Church can prepare itself for
the inevitable time when its only adherents will
be a few rich old maids with a mania for foreign
missions. For no country nowadays has any use
for a church which considers that the supply of
“good healthy food, good clothing, and good
houses” is the wrong way to start improving the
common lot.

Where Calfskins Count as Wages.
The publication of the new Federal Arbitration
Bill has caused a tremendous commotion amongst
Tories all over the Commonwealth ; indeed, the
sudden appearance of a whale in Collins-spteet,
or a rhinoceros in George-street, would have been
a far milder occurrence. The new Act provides,
amongst other things, for :
(1) The inclusion of all trades and industries.
(2) Compulsory preference to unionists.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dear days that are warm with earth’s gladness,
When life is a glorified thing ;
Though the parsons are stricken with madness —
Abjuring all grief and all sadness,
Let’s arise and be cheerful in spring !
Fair morns that are splendid and gracious,
That are flagrant with blossomed delight;
When the soul groweth noble and spacious,
Holding feelings serene and veracious,
Whilst the preachers get angry and fight!
Bright hours and high noons of dear glory—
Rich moments of rapture and grace,
When the cove who is holy and hoary
Resurrecteth the blood-soaken story,
And the whiskers dilate on his face !
We are sinful, they say, in our morals,
We are shipped, f.0.b., to our doom ;
But the saints ? —hear the Snowballs and Wor-
ralls.
Also Judkins— how fiercely he quarrels
When Wattle’s in Bloom !
Dear days when the voice of Dill Macky
Lifteth loudly at morning and noon ;
Hear the sectary’s frantic attack; he
Is a sanctified clerical lackey,
Who was boiling with fervor in June !
In July, lo ! the saint effervesces,
All his rancor explodes with a roar ;
In the spring-time he thunders addresses—
He alternately curses and blesses,
And he clamors for Somebody’s gore !
Bright hours when the Pope is confounded,
And the pietists caper and sing;
When the timbrel of conflict is sounded—
When the jaw and the blare are unbounded,
Glad products, dear brethren, of spring !
’Tis the time when the blear-eyed fanatic
Pursues holy spooks round the room ;
Yea, the wheezy and old and rheumatic
Hold sectarian tongue-fights ecstatic
When Wattle’s in Bloom.
Dear days when the shrill politician
Talketh loudly and needlessly long ;
When the howl of the vexed Opposition
Is like that of the fiends in perdition
Prodded deep with Beelzebub’s prong !
Very fierce is the wail of each member—
Hear the Johnsons and Kellys and Cooks ;
They will rage louder still in November—
They will roar like the damned in December,
They are moaning at present like spooks !
Bright hours of debate and division—
Hear the clang of the Parliament bells ;
“ To the right of the chair !”—in collision,
Hear the jeer and the gibe of derision
As the teller despondently tells !
Hear the cheer of the person who Sosheth,
And the wail of Freetrade in its tomb;
Though ’tis dead as the late Mephibosheth,
Still the tide of inanity rushetli
When Wattle’s in Bloom !
Dear days that are filled with the clamor
Of parties and views out of date;
’Midst the roar of the shrill gospel-jammer
And the bleating of Cooks, still the hammer
On the drill pounds an anthem elate !
Though the whiskers are needlessly waving,
And the Judkinses blare extra loud;
Though the Johnsons and Kellys are raving,
There’s a Prospect, dear brethren, of saving
All this Land from the cere-cloth and shroud !
Fair morns that are signs of the guerdon,
New hopes and New Leaders to dare ;
Whilst they rage so one can’t get a word in,
Let us march ! —bend your backs ’neath the burden,
Let’s be done with regret and despair !
Whilst the Talkers and Wowsers are vicing,
Be ye forward to act in their room ;
Hoist the Flag of our hopes— keep it flying ! —
For the old , foolish factions arc dying
When Wattle’s in Bloom !
VICTORIA.

any sort were before Parliament, to take it pretty
well for granted that the “ farming industry,” and
country industries in general, must not be dealt
with at all. It got at last to be accepted, as a sort of
theological dogma or an axiom of Euclid that the
“primary industries” would be crippled, or even
burst up altogether, if they were forced to pay
decent wages and work under humane conditions.
And so the great cow biz. was allowed to be con-
ducted just as the land-owner pleased. And that
affluent person was pleased very often to employ
a man for seven days out of the seven, working 14
hours per day, for the munificent wages of 10s.
or 12s. per week and the calf-skins. The calf-
skins were a very precarious addition to the
employee’s wage, as the number of calves on one
dairy farm is, of course, limited, and calves only
occur at one season of the year. Further, the
unhappy employee had to skin the calves himself,
and sell the skins to the casual hawker. Of late
years the calf-skin agreement has been ridiculed
out of fashion ; but even to-day the ruling wage
for a man working the hours already stated is
from 15s. to 20s. per week and found. Even then
he is not given permanent employment. And all
the while this iniquity has been going on land has
been soaring up in value. For example, in the
Victorian Western District there is not an acre
of dairying land which is not to-day worth at
least double its value 10 years ago. But the
Fisher proposal, which will probably, in a round-
about way, end in considerably altering the awful
status of the farm hand, will be cursed by shire
councils, agricultural societies, farmers’ leagues
and the like even unto seventy times seven. And
the rage and horror of the Legislative Council
obstructionists and their allies at being circum-
vented will be a fearsome thing to witness. Alto-
gether it is a cold day for the advocate of cheap
labor and the employer of women and children,
and their prospects are just as dark as an
aboriginal’s funeral.

Defence Made Easy.
If a Japanese armada swooped down on Australia, it
would not come in at the back door as many have sup-
posed. It would come straight to Sydney, the head-
quarters of the wealth and population of the continent.
The loss of the Northern Territory would affect us no
more than the capture of New Guinea. No enemy could
come overland from the north. — Colonel Campbell.
And on this text “D.M.W.” speaks a piece:—
The people of Australia should be deeply indebted to
Colonel Campbell for his expert opinion on Australian
defence, and the easy and pleasant, not to say inex-
pensive, manner in which he dismisses the whole ques-
tion. It will be remembered that when Hannibal began
his invasion of the Roman territories he did not (as so
many untruthful historians have asserted) bring his
armies through Spain and Gaul, and over the passes of
the Alps. Such a proceeding, as Colonel Campbell knows,
would have been utterly absurd. As a matter of
course, he went straight to Rome, the headquarters
of the wealth and population of the peninsula. The
loss of Ois-Alpine Gaul could have affected Rome
no more than the loss of Corsica. Similarly when Wil-
liam the Norman invaded England he did not land at the
obscure port of Hastings (as the absurd historians still
frequently assert) but at London, the headquarters of
the wealth and population of the island. Again, when
Britain was at war with France in 1759 it didn’t attack
that country in its remote outpost of Canada, which
would have been foolish. It sent Wolfe and his army
straight to Paris. The story of Quebec and the Heights
of Abraham is a fish narrative. As Colonel Campbell
knows, and as he has been kind enough to point out, the
invariable method adopted by an invading army is to
make a direct attack upon the chief city of the invaded
territories. Any other method would be ridiculous, and
would excite laughter, and nothing annoys an invader
more than to be laughed at. Thus it will be observed
that in the defence of England the only point necessary
to consider is the efficient protection of London. In the
defence of the German Empire, Berlin is the one place
at which an attack need be feared. In the late
war with Japan Russia triumphed through the security
of St. Petersburg because no Japanese attack was pos-
sible at any other point. The loss of Port Arthur could
have affected Russia no more than the loss of Nova
Zembla. This is the great and foundation principle that
must be borne in mind in preparing to resist any inva-
sion. The invaders must attack the headquarters of
wealth and population. The problem of Australian
defence is thus narrowed down to a very small point
indeed, and with a few strategic railways radiating from
the headquarters of the wealth and population of this
continent to bring the Federal forces through the Red-
fern tunnel all must be well. Australia is under a
deep obligation to Colonel Campbell for his timely state-
ment by which he has placed the Northern Danger in its
true light, and shown us from an expert military point
of view what we may really expect.
And yet, Colonel Campbell, with all due respect to your
superior knowledge, the loss of the Northern Terri-
tory would affect us more than the loss of Papua.
Let Northern Australia once be occupied by an
Asiatic Power, and a long and bitter and gory
struggle begins along an ever-varying boundary line.
Year by year would see the" brown or yellow
man creeping further to the south. Year by year
the dauntless few of the white race would hurl them-
selves upon the countless thousands of the alien. Year
by year the broken remnants of our armies would
struggle back to defend a narrower Commonwealth. At
last the headquarters of the wealth and population of a
continent would hear the enemies’ guns, but they would
sound their challenge not from bevond Manly and
Coogee, but from Willoughby and Summer Hill. The
Northern Territory does matter. It is at once our great
hope, and our chief point of danger.
Mostly About Boots.
“0.K.” writes:—
The “gags” of the shop windows are getting on my
nerves. Seeing that the public is supposed to be pro-
tected by the law against various kinds of impositions on
its credulity, I would suggest that misleading window-
cards or goods-tickets be added to the list of frauds. For
instance, the card which presents in one corner a bogus
original price of the article printed in black ink with a
red line running through it whilst the allegedly reduced
price in red ink appears in an opposite corner. Thus the
most gullible customers—and many of them are most
gullible—are made to believe that something previously
marked at, say, 14s. 6d. is now being offered at 11s. 9d.,
and so forth, although such cards are palpably mere tricks
of the trade. All shops, or nearly all, resort to this hollow
attempt at deception. Evidently a measure of success
is expected, or the system wouldn’t be so popular. Drapers
and fancy-goods dealers are persistent offenders in this
particular. Also they are addicted to the habit of at-
taching “sale price” cards to their goods,.as though
prices in general were not intended to effect sales. But
the bootshops are the most irritating of all in their
catchpenny devices. The card with two prices printed
on it is only a drop in the ocean of boot-sellers’ “ gags.”
You see a pair of shoes marked “For Present Wear,” as
though other pairs were not for immediate use, but were
meant to be “ laid down ” in a cellar, or somewhere, like
port wine. You see boots with pointed toes labelled
“Latest Fashion,” with round toes labelled “Extreme
Mode,” with square toes professing to be “ Up to Date,”
ranged side by side. This awful conflict of allegations
seems calculated to soften the brains of the credulous who
are looking for mere boots for wearing purposes. The
mention of “ wearing purposes” brings me to the matter
of leather, which is a matter concerning the health of
the community. Sickness often, and death occasionally,
are the results of fraudulent and inferior boot-soles. The
“ stinking fish ” criers in this country have always de.
dared that leather locally prepared is not so well tanned
as the leather (Australian-born in many cases) tanned
abroad. Knowing nothing of the process of tanning, I
can’t say whether the good Australian hides are impro-
perly cured, but I can swear that a lot of the manufac-
tured leather in many sorts of goods is insufficiently
fatted. Leather should be steeped in oil before it is
“ made up.” It will absorb much oil, which is an expens-
ive item in its preparation ; and I have proved that ordin-
ary boot-soles, like cheap leather straps, are sinfully
open to improvement by smearing them again and again
with salad oil. They suck it up as greedily as an anti-
bilious Jew or a sheet of blotting-paper. In short,
they are not good, damp-resisting leather when
they are put on the market, for the simple
reason that they have been stinted of grease
by dishonest dealers. When the soles have been fairly
fed with oil they look more leathery than before,
and become reasonably damp-proof. They are the
genuine article in an improved form—the form in which
it ought to be when the boots appear in a shop-window
as “ For Present Use.” But the soles turned out from
certain factories in Melbourne—the early centre of the
Australian boot trade—are not genuine leather. They
consist of cardboard covered with a composition of
leather filings and glue squeezed into a solid thickness,
and finished off with a black polish. Cheap imported
boots also are suspected of composition soles, and just
now a Trades Hall representative of the Tanners’ Union
in Melbourne is reviving an old discussion of this boot-
trade scandal. Five years ago the Bent Government was
asked to make the vending of bogus leather a punishable
offence under the Pure Foods Act, but the application
was refused. This time something will be done, pre-
sumably. Some test will be legally imposed on the soles
that pretend to be leather. Yet, until the standard of
quality in real leather has been raised, I cannot see that
mock flannel, masquerading as woollen stuff, is more
dangerous to the public health than the boots with
porous soles that are labelled “ For Present Use.”
Leather.
“Hermes”: There is a quaint idea that Aus-
tralian-made leather smells, as a matter of course.
But the fact that some Australian hides tanned
abroad came back perfumed and some didn’t,
long ago knocked out the idea that the odor in
question had anything to do with the hides them-
selves. The trouble was that the work was not
done properly in Australia’s early days, and that
the animal tissues were not completely removed
from the leather. To do this properly meant a
considerable outlay of capital, and the early Aus-
tralian leather-maker was usually a man with a
very small amount of capital behind him, any-
how ; and the bulk of that which he had was mostly
invested in an agency for some foreign leather.
Very few Australian tanners were wholly
tanners; they were generally hybrids, com-
prised of one-third manufacturer and two-thirds
importer. They were, in the mass, opposed to heavy
duties on leather, because such duties would kill
their agencies and lead to the establishment
of leather factories in Australia by Yankee,
English and French firms. The existing system
suited them very well, and they were "doing
nicely on it. Drastic changes, they said, were
odious. But Australia is rapidly stepping into
the foremost place as the world’s storehouse of
raw hides. America is using up all its own supply
and importing. Argentina is beginning to do like-
wise as far as concerns eating up its own supply.
English, French, German and Austrian leather
makers are at their wits’ ends to get raw material,
and Australia is the only country which has it in
large quantities' to spare. If Australia strikes
this trade with a heavy export duty, the hides
will be manufactured here, and some hundreds of
thousands of foreign capital will be spent here in
erecting tanneries, and the population will be in-
creased by an enormous influx of skilled leather
workers. The “ primary industry ” people howl
like a covey of devils about the necessity fcr
encouraging immigration, yet immediately an
export duty that will encourage it on a large
scale is mentioned, they squeal against the im-
position of that duty. The gain to Australia
would be enormous. With Australia suddenly
developed into the world’s centre of the leather
supply, every man on the land would benefit.
Stock-raising would become more profitable than
ever, and provide a good opening for the people
who will be rushing to take advantage of the
result of the progressive land-tax that now looms
on the horizon of things. It would almost cer-
tainly have a beneficial effect on the empty Terri-
tory by supplying a big market right on the
spot for what the Territory can grow in
unlimited numbers even before its railway is
finished—cattle, buffaloes, angoras and marsu-
pials. The difference between exporting the
hides and the manufactured product can be
gauged from the returns for 1908, when the raw
material that went into the Commonwealth tan-
neries was worth £1,654,396, and the leather that
came out had soared up to £2,191,689, or £537,293
more. This industry would be worth fostering
anyhow, but under the exceptional circumstances,
it would be suicidal not to encourage it by the
imposition of a stiff hide-export duty.
Attorney-General Wade, of N.S.W. has won a
law case—the appeal from the verdict of the jury
which awarded £431 damages against the State
for injuries caused to a pupil at a public school.
During a chemistry lesson the headmaster sent
an assistant teacher for a tumbler, but the order
was carried out by a schoolboy, who, finding
a liquid in the glass, threw it (the liquid)
out of a window. Unfortunately, it was sul-
phuric acid, and it landed in the eye of a boy
named Hole, with serious results to his sight.
Hole, senior, sued the Government for damages,
for the obvious reason that if there was any chance
of obtaining a substantial amount it was not from
the careless boy or the schoolmaster who
had allowed him access to the dangerous
goods. The jury found that the master was neg-
ligent, and awarded £431; but the Full Court,
while agreeing with the finding of negligence
against the master, decided that his lapse did not
bind the Government. The appeal was upheld
with costs; but the Court delicately hinted to
Wade that, in the very painful circumstances, the
Government might waive the question of costs.
And, considering the huge pile of costs that Wade
has had to pay in the past, a few more costs
would make no difference worth mentioning.

The N.S.W. Pure Foods Act made a poor show-
ing in a Sydney police court last week, when a
milk distributing co. was summoned for selling
watered milk. An inspector had bailed up a milk
cart, bearing the eo.’s name and the co.’s
manager’s name. The milk was found to be
watered to the extent of 7 per cent. This cart was
identical in appearance with dozens that leave the
co.’s yard daily, yet the defence was that the co.
didn’t sell thecowfruit. The books were produced
to show that the name of the man on the cart was
not the name of a paid employee of the co. He
merely attended daily at the eo.’s premises and
paid £1 Is. each time—lBs. 6d. for milk purchased
and 2s. 6d. for hire of the cart. The manager of
the co. in reply to the magistrate said he had no
objection to carts being hired to irresponsible
men—carts with the company’s name on them.
The Bench held that the driver was not an agent
for the co., and dismissed the case, which is a
poor look-out for the Australian infant who. by
his agent (his ma), patronises the said co. Also,
it is a poor look-out for the Bure Foods Act, if it
can be taken down so easily.

The incredible O’Callaghan, over-age Commis-
sioner of Police for Victoria, being tackled on the
subject of a notorious Melbourne hazard-school,
which is apparently run by a “ fizgig,” and is pre-
sumably a fruitful source of blackmail, diploma-
tised as follows:—
The police can hardly prevent such gatherings from
originating. They can put an end to them sooner or
later, but where the utmost possible precautions are
taken to prevent information regarding them reaching
the police, it is, of course, not easy for the police to get
on their track. Still, it is only a matter of time before
such schools are dispersed.
All of which is quite beside the point that a recent
Argus article on one particular hazard-school
gave a column of information about it to
the public and the police—not that the
latter needed enlightening. Readers of The
Lone Hand will remember how, a year
or two ago, a notorious hazard-schoolmaster
and pal of the police complained, with refreshing
candor, that he was not the most favored law-
breaker in this particular line of misdemeanor.
His “schools,” he said, had been from time to
time broken up, whilst others were flourishing
under the toleration of Melbourne’s precious
police authorities. O’Callaghan’s pretence of
police ignorance re “the existence of a large
hazard-school in a lane off Bourke-street ” was an
audacious insult to public intelligence. And the
attitude of Premier Murray, who is retaining
O’Callaghan in office beyond that discredited
official’s retiring age, is impudently defiant of
public opinion. Had ' Prendergast taken the
re-appointment of O’Callaghan as the text for
his want-of-confidence motion against the Govern-
ment, the supporters of John Weary might have
been shamed into giving him the kick out.
«
“Silk”: The allegations made by Meagher,
M.L.A., in the N.S.W. Assembly last week con-
cerning the selection of jurors to try Peter Bow-
ling, and the reply (!) of Wade, Premier and
Attorney-General, that he did not know what had
happened, might very properly be made the
subject of an appeal for a new trial. The charge
against Bowling was conspiracy, with a flavor of
sedition in the indictment, and every principle of
justice and law demands that under such indict-
ments the Crown should hold itself as far removed
from the jury as the accused is obliged to do.
Bowling's case comes fully within a sphere of
comparison with the case of Daniel O’Connell, in
Ireland, in 1844, when the Liberator was charged
with conspiracy, with a frilling of sedition.
To make sure of a conviction on that occasion,
the Crown authorities took pains to ascertain the
characters of the jurors and the direction of their
opinions. As a result, the jury was constituted
of men upon whom the Crown (or Government)
could rely to convict. The conviction followed,
and O’Connell was sentenced to 12 months’
imprisonment and fined £2OOO. But information
soon leaked out as to the jury taint, and on appeal
to the House of Lords that tribunal pronounced
the trial a mockery, and quashed the conviction.
O’Connell, after lying 14 weeks in prison, was
accordingly released. My opinion is that the
cases are sufficiently parallel to justify an appeal
for Bowling’s release.

Cold Tea Bruntnell, after various attempts,

owing to a hopelessly split vote, Parliament dis-

tried for nomination in several places, and the
fact that he has been awarded Annandale points
to the supposition that the seat is a rocky propo-

“TRILBY” AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Act One—the studio with easels and
Long Taffy getting through some household graft,
A wheezy bellows gasping in his hand
While his blonde weepers flutter in the draught.
Mrs. Vinard—a landlady who shakes
All day with laughter, and resides downstairs—
Is showing red-faced Taffy that she takes
An interest in boarders’ love affairs.
She tells him he’s in love—head over ears—
With fair-haired Trilby. Taffy madly blows,
And begs of her to stop. He greatly fears
The secret will leak out, she so o’erflows.
Madame at last, shrieking with joy, retires ;
The Laird, in borrowed whiskers and a straw
Hat of the same, bright-reddish hue, transpires;
He’s Scottish—of the brand well known as “braw.’'
Later, a stripling about eight-stone-four,
Who seems distraught, comes bounding in to tea ;
His entrance is the signal for a roar—
It is the lightweight lover—young Billee.
He makes the Laird and Taffy both turn green,
And fall into a drab, despairful mood,
By telling them that Trilby he has seen
Posing for other artists “ in th’ nood."
Whilst they are reeling ’neath this shocking blow,
The model Miss arrives to have a yarn ;
They strive to look as if they did not know
Or care a single Nonconformist darn.
But the grim secret later comes to light,
And Trilby, weeping, leaves the studio ;
Whereat the “pig-dogs ” groan as if a blight
Had fallen on their rotten picture show.
And little Bill for Italy departs—
His youthful heart with such resentment burns ;
But he comes rushing back. Two loving hearts
Are fused—for Trilby’s there when he returns.
Act Two—the studio on Christmas Eve ;
High kicking is the order of the day ;
On ev’ry player’s part one can perceive
A stern determination to be gay.
Into the maddest of the revels spins
A black-draped figure, short and rather fat;
’Tis William’s uncle who goes hunting sins
With tearful snuffles and a soup-plate hat.
Bill’s grey-haired mother trembles at the door
Until the revellers are put to flight ;
Then Taffy and the Uncle take the floor,
And argue as to whether it is right
That young Billee, who is a youth well-born,
Should wed the girl on whom he’s wholly “ gone,"
And earn the Truly Good’s glad hoot of scorn
Because his wife once posed “ mid codings on.”
Ere the row ends. Trilby herself comes in ;
To her the mother pleads and wins at length
A promise that she—Trilby—will not sin
By wedding Billy. Taffy prays for strength
To keep from bursting, shows the old pair out,
And calls the festive crowd to gather round ;
The atmosphere is one of gloomy doubt
Until the one and only way is found.
“ Elope, then! ” someone shouts ; “ the Belgian law
Is kinder than the French ! ” To search the street
For carriages, the joyous mob withdraw.
Svengali rises from the window seat.
He is the wireless station. From his eyes
He sends his ethergrams to Trilby’s brain ;
She writes a farewell note ; he bids her rise,
Then leads her out. They don’t come back again.
Five years elapse, and all the same old crew
Are found in ev’ning clobber at a show ;
When Trilby’s mentioned, wistful tears bedew
All eyes, and spirits dwindle down to low.
The famous La Svengali sweeps at last
On to the gauze-dimmed stage and starts to Tril.;
The Laird’s and Taffy’s wonderment is vast,
But greater far the agony of Bill.
Between the numbers the Svengalis rest ;
Young Bill attempts to bring his Trilby round;
Sven, strikes him ; Taffy fiercely drags Sven.’s vest,
And throws him and his whiskers on the ground.
Svengali, whose infernal dynamo
Is quite exhausted, struggles to a chair
And gasps while Trilby busts the stylish show
(The good old wireless is no longer there).
The crowd’s loud hoots arouse Sven, from his trance ;
He staggers up and once more tries to beat
The absent band, whilst in a slow, sad dance
He circles on two large, reluctant feet.
At last he falls—as ail Svengalis must—
Backwards across a table with his head
Hanging some inches from the fine floor-dust.
A very awkward way to drop down dead.
Poor, half-awakened Trilby by the Laird
Is taken from the room ere one can wink ;
One feels relieved that she the sight is spared,
But notices the Laird’s new beard is pink.
Five days go by, and at a good hotel
A rather stronger Trilby with her Bill
Is found most sweetly promising, when well,
To say with due solemnity, “ I will.”
Two encore verses of “ Ben Bolt” she sang ;
Then fell and died. To her young corse so white
Young Billy rushed and sobbed. I said, “ Oh, hang !
That is the third good cry he’s had to-night."

After a lapse of several years, ‘‘Trilby
was revived on Saturday last by Nellie Stewart
and Co. A houseful of people came along
t i the revival —some of them to watch the
experiment and compare the Australian star s
methods with those of Edith Crane and Nance
O’Neill; others to make the acquaintance of the
drama itself,.which seems to have developed into
a theatrical evergreen. The play is capably pro-
duced for the new firm of J. C. Williamson,
Ltd., by Gaston Mervale, who plays Svengali.
The Mervale production departs from the usual
setting in the third act, because, on a curtain
being drawn aside, Trilby and Svengali can
actually be seen performing. the
audience had only the applause ‘ off
and the distant warbling of ‘“Ben Bolt
to go upon; the rest had to be imagined.
Miss Stewart, as Trilby, has in an amaz-
ing degree the freshness of youth ; but her
acting in the first of the two studio scenes, on the
opening night at any rate, though finished, was
lacking in joyousness. As the play progressed
and the Trilby horizon grew darker, she took
hold better, and at the end of the second act she
had both the part and the house well in hand.
Nellie Stewart, when she is pathetic, would drag
sympathy out of a stone; and as the last two
acts of “Trilby” are rather more sorrowful
than the average, she scores heavily to the
end. Then she has to resurrect herself from
the death-couch to bow her acknowledg-
ments and gather a harvest of flowers. Gas
ton Mervale’s Svengali is a finished portrait,
heavily retouched and painstakingly horrible
down to the last detail. Harcourt Beatty, in his
new Scotch accent and a light beard, makes a
cheerful and, at times, hilarious Laird ; and
Eardley Turner acts with life-like restraint and
heaviness as Taffy. A. L. Pearce, the Little
Billee of the company, is emotional with reluct-
ance ; and this paper doesn’t blame him for it.
He-is sufficiently ardent in the love scenes, and
altogether his distressful row is hoed with com-
mendable evenness. J. B. Atholwood, as the
Rev. Bagot, plays in a spirit of broad comedy, and
does it excellently. Gregan McMahon makes a
rather coldly sober Zou-Zou ; and A. J. Patrick,
as Dodor, is colorless ; while Norman Campbell, as
Colonel Kaw, talks through his nose harder than
he need. Madeleine Meredith, who plays Mrs.
Bagot, is quietly ladylike and limp; and Rossl.yn
Vane is a satisfactory Mrs. Vinard, except when
she laughs too long at Taffy in the first act.

The spruce Besses o’ th’ Barn came trium-
phantly back to Sydney last Thursday and piled
their curled and glittering brass instruments on
the platform of the Town Hall beneath an
immense striped canopy that hid the mute and
inglorious organ. The first six or seven rows of
floor seats were occupied by a solid wall of uni-
formed local bandsmen who had come to admire
and drink in the genuine old ’54 port of melody
that the Besses cause to flow from their
golden-toned cornets, trombones and horns.
Under the baton of Mr. Chris Smith, who has
temporarily taken up the duties of conductor
Owen, tiie skilled instrumentalists played
through an impressive programme which began
with Meyerbeer’s “Schiller” March, and in-
cluded a solo each for the euphonium and cornet
and one for the.xylophone. The amazing purity
and richness of tone attained in the softer passages
occasionally deluded the ear into the belief that
the instruments were really made of 18-carat
material, till the sharp clash of the cymbals or the
electric rattle Of the kettledrums broke the spell.
Sometimes the flowing music in its volume re-
sembled the Snowy at sunset; at others it rippled
like a mountain Creek ; and when it swelled and
crashed it thundered majestically like surf. But
it was always soothing, with a deep mellowness
compounded of exquisite skill and incessant prac-
tice. It is the unofficial but glorious mission of
the Besses to go about the earth educating the
rank-and-file brass bandsman and the public
generally to the fact that the cornet and its
shining brothers, when blown with art, will coo
as gently as doves, send top-notes, sweet and clear
as a tenor’s soaring to the roof, and soothe the
savage beast who pays. The Sydney season is an-
nounced to conclude on Saturday night.

There was some fine music at the Lieder-
tafel concert, held at Sydney Town Hall on
Wednesday evening, and the date being near
enough to what would have been the one hun-
dredth birthday of Schumann, were that once-
adulated and now somewhat old-fashioned com-
poser still composing, the occasion was made a
Schumann concert. L. Godfrey Smith at the
piano, E. Mowat Carter leading the orchestra,
and Arundel Orchard as conductor were the chief
bigwigs in a programme which bristled with the
names of our music-making aristocracy. After the
concerto (the big item of the list) the audience
grew most excited, and signalled its enthusiastic
approval of Godfrey Smith’s piano-playing by
making that already hard-worked person come
back and play some more. G. Smith should take
care of himself, because good men like him are
very scarce. He plays the right things in the
right way., Schumann doesn’t matter quite
as much as he did when most people
who called themselves musical, in mid-Vic-
torian days, were thinking him rather awfully
advanced. He became the fashion, and not
to admire Schumann was to be counted right
out in musical circles. But now he has been a bit
outclassed, though of course he has his niche. He
belongs to the Carlyle-Murger-Thackeray period,
andif the young musician hasn’t already made his
acquaintance, Schumann may safely be skipped,
with merely a passing nod. Miss Mylor Burge
sang “ The Shadow Song ” in a trilling soprano,
and was encored. The concert, taking it by and
large, was one, of the best.

“D.” was among those present:—
I \fent to Mr. McCabe’s lecture on “Spain and the
Martyrdom of Ferrer” last week, prepared, as it were, to
pray. (I was twice in Spain, once for nearly three
months, and it impressed me on both occasions as an in-
sanitary, bathless, flea-haunted, and generally uncivilised
land that merited the worst a lecturer could hand it.) I
stayed to scoff. There seems to be some occult influence
hovering around all sectarian discussions that impels the
controversialists to go in for the cheapest variety of
Bilandersonian claptrap. To my grief, McCabe started
his discourse this way
“My desire to return to you has been accelerated by
one Sydney gentleman who has written that I shall not
leave your Commonwealth alive, because I have lectured
on Ferrer and the martyrdom of Ferrer.”
The name of the alleged homicidal maniac wasn t
specified. .It never is. No details were given of
where, or when he wrote his murderous threat, so
that the authorities might take steps to iden-
tify him and run him in, and thereby vindicate
the reputation of Australia as a land which, even if
it is afflicted with Joe Cook, Land Monopoly and Debt, is
progressive enough withal to chastise criminals who
lightly threaten harmless visitors with assassination.
When some old Dill accuses Tamworth, or some other
inoffensive N.S.W. town, of discharging firearms at him,
and blandly produces a riddled kerosene tin by way of
proof, we understand and, smiling tolerantly, pass on.
But we expect one of McCabe’s mental calibre to be
different.
There was a depressing amount of blood, mystery and
melodrama during the evening. For instance, McCabe
told how a young SDanish officer “ braved the anger of
the R.C. Church” and defended Ferrer. “From that
day to this,” said the lecturer, amid shudders, “he has
not been heard of. What has happened? I forbear to
say. I leave it to vou.” Another military defender
of Ferrer lasted three weeks, it appeared, and then
blew h' s brains out. “ Why do I not go to Spain?” in-
quired Mr. McCabe. “Ahha ! You may possibly guess.
In any case, the people whom. I would have liked to meet
are ail dead-r-slain by the Romish Church.” Followed
some marrow-freezing details of dungeons on the Spanish
coast, in whose recesses innocent, well-meaning people
are immured till they get consumption, or are shot, or
hanged—all at the instance of the Church. “How did
Ferrer die?” perorated the lecturer. “Muttering to a
priest? No ; with his face to the soldiers’ rifles." Which,
after all, is the way people mostly do die who have been
sentenced to be shot, and have failed either to escape
or to dissuade their captors from pursuing the unpleasant
business to a finish.
The audience was, of course, of the militantly wowser
variety, and McCabe seemed to argue down to its intelli-
gence. Amid cheers he remarked that 68 per cent, of
Spaniards couldn’t read or write, and referred doubters
to “ the text books.” Certainly the text-books note that
the last time the Census officers concerned themselves
with this question 68 per cent, of Spaniards neither read
nor wrote. But that was in 1889 when education was in
a bad way elsewhere than in Spain. To-day, in Spain.
(vide “Statesman’s Year Book,” 1909) there are 26,000
public schools (attended by 2,000,000 pupils), and 6000
private schools (attended by 350,000 pupils), and the
population of the country is only 20,000,000. There are
no recent illiteracy figures; but, taking their schooling
facilities into consideration, Spaniards would need to be
a demented race to stand, educationally speaking, where
they did 21 years ago.
But what futile, resultless, time-wasting performances
these sectarian outbursts seem, anyhow,, when they are
engaged in by men capable of useful work. Most of
McCabe’s remarks, last week, dealt with the moral de-
pravity of Europe between 500 A.D. and 1500 a.d., alleg-
edly as a result of the existence of the R.C. Church.
Yet, during that period, the R.C. Church and the Greek
Church divided most of Europe pretty equally, and what
they didn’t divide was plain heathen. As an instance, it
was as late as 1225 when measures were taken for the
conversion of the Prussian idolators. And an. inspection
of the results suggests that every church is just as bad
as its period, and as bad as the local civilisation around
it. The nation raises itself or more or less agnostic
statesmen who are free from clerical influences raise
it, and it drags the church up with it. Or else
it sinks, and the church slides down with it. It
wasn’t the R.C. Church or the Greek Church or the
bogus gods of Prussia that made Europe what it was in
the 12th century ; it was a wretched system of govern-
ment which made the churches and the wooden gods
what they were. And they were a very bad lot.

The Dardinis and their crockery-smash act
are to drop off Sydney Tivoli programme after
the performance on Wednesday evening, some
hours before this Bulletin perches itself on the
bookstalls for sale. Prophecy is a precarious
animal, so this scribe hesitates to thrust his pen
into the future and write in cold ink that they
actually dropped. The week-end show, from pre-
sent indications, will consist almost entirely of
people who have received more or less honorable
mention several times before—the Charlenes,
Powell and Vesey, De Lyle and Brunin, Frank
Travis, and the dancing McLeans, who still hang
on to their old unwise signboard—“the Australian
Dartos.” Further consideration of comedian Fred
Keeton and his painful song about the half-witted
youth impels one to ask if the grimaces and facial
contortions are absolutely essential. In the
Writer’s opinion the ditty would be quite shudder-
some enough without the singer’s “business.”
“THE ARCA-
DIANkS,” AT
SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Essie Perrin
in Arcadia.
The danger of fooling around with gipsy
girls when one is in a good billet is borne out by
the Pathe Freres film at West’s Palace show,
wherein the narrow escape of Napoleon 111. is
shown. Nap., it seems, was a gay dog who
recked little whose preserves he poached upon.
West’s are also showing a series in connec-
tion with the Richmond disaster. An In-
dian drama, which reveals what may
happen to a man of the conquered race
who happens to fall in love with a woman of
the conquering race, is dramatically revealed. It
also shows what happens to the rival of the con-
quering race. He gets bitten by a snake
left in his lady love’s bag. The Hindu
gets shot, and the way that the dead
body of the “snaker” is carried across the
curtained doorway is a most artistic touch.
West's have now taken to a sort of weekly sum-
mary of the notable events in Sydney, and
last week’s little lot showed the Boy Scouts
at the Centennial Park, the iriter-State hockey
match, and a few other trifles. This draws
Society, which gazes intently to catch its .own
phiz on the same film as that of the Governor.
Mr. Higgins, Charles Spencer’s chief
operator, was travelling in the train that was
smashed up at Richmond (Vic.) and had his tools
with him. Scrambling out of the wrecked train, he
upended his machine and leaned heavily on the
legs of it while he whirled the handle taking
views of the efforts of the rescuers to recover the
mangled. This dreadful series is now running at
the Lyceum, much to the disgust of all railway
men. “Oliver Twist,” staged by a French co., is
at present chasing the Richmond horror across the
fleeting screen, and, as is usual With French
actors, the facial studies are a sight for the gods
and the artistic. The advisability of always be-
friending pretty women in distress is driven home
by a series, which shows how the girl who
was late for rehearsal through attending to her
sick mother, was saved by the intercession of
the leading man. Later on, when she is a star
and making millions with her own company, she
finds the former benefactor in a mighty bad way,
visits him in his dingy quarters where he lies at
death’s door, and puts her arm round his neck.
It was a long while to wait for the arm, but he
got it in time. As said before, always act the
good Samaritan to the pretty girl in distress.

“Aladdin ” has left Adelaide Royal affcer-
an enthusiastic farewell evening. Some of the
jokes with which the piece started last Christmas
—concerning Reid’s departure, for instance, or a
certain Strike—are grown up now and have to
shave daily ; but these are only small woes at the
worst. The chorus-ladies have one great chance
when they parade as savages, each in a plain
brown garment with her hair down. To the male
eye, at any rate, they look more charming then
than in all their elaborate costumes; but women
will never appreciate that simple truth. “The
Night of the Party” is the present bill at the
Royal. It is somewhat too English for Australian
tastes. In England there are just three classes—
one that employs a crowd of domestics, a second
that supplies the crowd, the third (in between,
and chief supporters of the drama) that can’t afford
such a crowd, but vaguely hopes to be able to
some day, and meanwh'le loves to hear about the
few that can. Billy Williams has left the Tivoli,
taking his Wilson Barrett figure and his confiden-
tial ways with him. Many—women especially—
get enthusiastic over him ; but people who don’t
like him use the most injurious language concern-
ing his turn. The strenuous young person calling
herself Lillie Langtry has been singing and dan-
cing ; but the charming Olga Grey has wisely
moved on, just as she was tending to monotony.
Fred Bluett, at this house, has been giving a song
that is either innocent (and very nearly meaning-
less in that case) or guilty (and in that case alarm-
ing). The singer himself turns on the innocent
stop, and gets through without offence ; but it is
as well to keep the ambiguous off the stage. One
Morris Cronin has just stepped off the steamer
into the Tivoli, and his uncommon juggling gives
the programme a needed “ snap.” Also, Calvh is
at the Exhibition, and Joseph McCabe is in
various places, and the moving picture is every-
where.

The first Melbourne performance of
“Butterfly” at Her Majesty’s seemed to con-
vince a much-expecting audience that the orches-
tration of Puccini’s famous opera, which is the
first consideration, was exceptionally melodious
and expressive, and was, moreover, treated as
fully by conductor Hazon’s forces as any audience
could expect at the prices charged. The feast of
music was ample and the staging admirable. Only
from a dramatic, critical point of view was the
general effect unsatisfactory. The heroine rarely
suggested a 15-year-old Jap girl. The alleged
American naval lieutenant, who made belief
to marry her, was a plump, soft, curly,
unemotional hero, who never gripped one’s
attention; and the middle-aged paternal con-
sul, who should have bound the audience’s
sympathies to the deceived “wife” by seem-
ing sincerely sorry for the 'misalliance was
presented in a dry inflexible manner by Arthur
Crane, a good enough baritone with a thin person-
ality. There were plump people in the light and
irresponsible characters, and a thin young man in
the heavy father part. For the rest, Miss Buck-
mann, Edward Wynn and Ferguson filled their
minor places creditably ; whilst the lady choristers
wore Australian faces above their kimonos. No
Jap-cum-Yankee atmosphere was created by the
three leading performers in the story or by the
women attendants of Butterfly, whose introductory
chorus is the longest sustained “ theme,” or what
not, in the opera. The orchestral music, wherein
the voices are mostly so submerged that the Eng-
lish translation of the words becomes a clumsy
farce, gives all the atmosphere and most of the
human feeling to the work. It is, however, never
so full of feeling as in its nearest approach to
silent effect at the close of the second act, where
Butterfly’s maid and child grow weary of watch-
ing through the eyelet-holes in the paper win-
dows, and leave her to a lonely vigil.
Puccini is quite a Shakspeare among the
new school of broken-melody composers, but he
hasn’t the wide range of harsh, old Wagner. His
ingenuity in expressing all things sweetly,
save the tragic denouement, is as remarkable as
his audacity in taking whatever he wants
from popular airs. He cribs a bit of “ Star
Spangled Banner ” to emphasise the presence of
the Yankee Consul, and draws on “The Mikado”
from time to time, especially when the serio-
comic Prince happens along, with (presumably) a
proposal to extricate Butterfly from her pitiable
state of grass-widowhood. Yet in Puccini’s
saccharine and poetic music there is perhaps a
sameness that palls somewhat on the ear. This
opera revives memories of the lovely duet between
Mimi and Rudolph in “La Boheme.” As a tone
drama, it is more completely harmonious and
cohesive, but it lacks the novelty of “La
Boheme” of yore. The needless transla-
tion into English is particularly unsuited
to Miss Bel Sorel, the heroine of last Satur-
day’s performance. Her accent is French,
her singing method Italian, and her natural
vivacity refuses to be Japped out of recognition.
Her acting and appearance suggest Blanche
Arral tempered by Tittell Brune ; and, although
she plays and sings the part artistically, she never
appears thoroughly dominated by it. Blamires,
the tenor lover with a non-incisive voice, is hardly
more successful than Crane, as the important
Consul. To-night (Thursday)and again on Satur-
day, another pair of lovers will be provided in
Miss Amy Castles and John Zerga.
At Melbourne Royal the sinful inmates of
Mrs. Sharpe’s boarding-house continue to be
chastened, one at a time, by mysterious Matheson
Lang. The city is not unanimous in accepting
the Stranger and his influences as an impressive
object-lesson. Some regard him as a professional
hypnotist dealing with a round of subjects who
return to their normal condition after the show.
What strikes the present writer forcibly is the
maintenance of class distinction in the Stranger’s
conversions. Certainly the waster Majah goes
commercial-travelling as the result of the’new
influence, but the Jew still refuses to work
for his income. He merely advertises his
bogus silver mine as a bona-fide dairy farm,
and gets a promoter’s profits under another
heading. And Miss Britton, as the slavey,
becomes only a humble toiler with a cough,
instead of a healthy, hard-working sinner. She
gains nothing but a nasty chest complaint and a
lovely Tory faith in the goodness of the social
system, and she is patronised accordingly by the
other Christians. When they talk about her
health she says: “Anyone would think I was a
bed-ridden old woman past her work. I ain’t got
no korf.” And she goes away to scrub harder
than ever. What a lesson to Australian domes-
tics is “ The Passing of the Third Floor Back ” !
With a view to promulgating the doctrine of hard
work for slaveys and easy Christianity for lodgers,
the management is inviting local parsons to
attend matinees gratis on presentation of their
cards. At these times the free-pass pressman
feels drawn to the Church by a bond of mutual
interest, as it were.
** * *
“The Chance of a Lifetime” is now
putting in its third week at the King’s, but has
more nights to gallop ere it reaches the finishing
post. Meanwhile, the crowd on the far side of
the racecourse preserves the same unconcern as
before. Nothing can shake the stolidity of a
scene-painter’s crowd. The people just stand
there like a Chamber of Horrors, and the fact that
their average height is Bft. or so worries them
not at all.

In their third concert at Melbourne Town
Hall (last Saturday) the Vic. Professional Orches-
trians went one, or even two, better than their
previous best. The first item was the “Pathetic”
Symphony of the deceased Russian genius whose
name belied his work, because it was something
to sneeze at. Such things must be well done to
sound reasonable, and this performance was
powerfully reasonable, and, in many parts of it,
delightful. The “Carnaval Romain” Overture
of Berlioz was spiritedly played ; likewise the
catchy numbers in the “ Nut Cracker Suite.” The
orchestra gave a fine accompaniment to Seg-
mund’s love song from “ The Valkyrie,” sung by
Oswald Rippon in pure tone with the unruffled
serenity of a seraph in specs., and the programme
ended with the overture to “ Meistersinger.”
This didn’t seem to come up to the printed de-
scription of its Wagnerian meaning, but that pro-
bably was because it came after five o’clock. No
matinee concert should try to impress an audi-
ence after 5 p.m. Even a football match doesn’t
presume so much on public enthusiasm. The
next Vic. Pro. Orch. concert is fixed for Satur-
day, August 27, and the brethren have invited
Slapoffski to trip over to Melbourne to conduct
it. When will they get Government permission to
preach their gospel to paying congregations on
the blessed Sabbaths ?
** * *
“St. Elmo,” the old maid’s Bible and the
young maid’s rapture, is now presented as a. pic-
ture at Melbourne Olympia. Though refreshingly
brief, it retains much of the novel’s starchy piety.
Of the other items, “The Ranger’s Bride” is a
mirthful episode, while the absurdities of “ A
Smoked Husband ” should divert the morbid and
sweeten the sour. There is a cheerful wildness
about “The New Sign of the Globe Hotel ”; and,
as a counterpoise, “ The Two Brothers” is a tine
contribution to the “ preachy ” branch of fiction.
Shortly stated, it is the story of a horrible boozer,
who leaves the sin of the pewter for the peace of
the pew.
* * *- *
Tails’ programme at Melbourne Athen-
seum this week is wholly devoted to vehement
tales. “ Davy Crockett ” is the best story, and
shows how Davy wins a wife by cunning and
energy. As for the other pictures, the humor of
“ Tombolini in Love” is rough as compared
with the satire of “ Baby’s First Tooth.”
Exceedingly fatuous are the exploits of “Absent-
Minded Max,” while the yarn of “The Little
Mother ” is a more artistic item than “ Saved by
a Dog,” And, really, this last picture makes
human credulity throw in the towel. It ex-
hibits a dog that can apparently tow a boat and
two people over the waters of a tumbled bay.
** * *
At Melbourne Opera House, the bill is a
passable copy of last week’s document. The
Kremos are still the strongest attractions, but
much ecstasy is aroused by Bert Terrell, who
looks like the apotheosis of a “ Willie Boy.” Of
some others, Mendel continues to introduce his
disturbing keeper ; Fanny Powers is repeating
her imitations; while Billy Williams has returned
with his snigger and his giggle.
(For “Poverty Point ” see pages SO and 53.)
The International Harvester Co. tells
another story concerning some of its huge finan-
cial operations reported lately in the Aegus and
mentioned in The Bulletin (14/7/TO). The co.’s
Stock is 120 million dollars, half 7 per cent, pre-
ference and the other half ordinary. For four
years after the reconstruction of the co. the
ordinaries got no dividend, as the directors
reckoned that they would be wanting the money.
They did want it, and put it in the business ; and
at the end of the four years they issued to the
ordinary shareholders stock representing this
accumulated profit to the extent of 33J per cent, —
equal to an annual div. of 8 per cent, and a frac-
tion. There was, therefore, more than “water ’’
behind the new issue ; there was the profit accu-
mulated in the four years in which no div. was
paid. Though the International people don’t put
it that way, it was practically a bail-up of the
ordinary people for a third more capital.
Curious things may happen to a policeman
in N.S.W. Recently a Sydney police station
was rushed with this official memo. :
A hare escaped from the Parcels Depdt to-day, and I
would be glad if you will kindly make inquiries with a
view to locating it.

a piece as to the “ social evil.” In the opinion of

equally with the woman. But while the latter
is treated as an outcast, the man is received
in gilded drawing-rooms.” It is far too sweeping
a statement. “The man,” undoubtedly, is re-

The Rev. T. S. B. Woodfull, discoursing
at Bendigo on the Richmond railway catastrophe,
said : “ Why that fog? Why did God allow it to
come? I don’t think these things happen
casually. I believe the disaster was a message to
Victoria.” From subsequent remarks of his we
gather that the smashing of two trains, the kill-
ing of nine people and the great damage of many
others was prooably intended as a warning from
Heaven against the policy of the Railway Com-
missioners in running Sunday trains. Provi-
dence, it seems, wrecks trains on Monday as a
protest against trains on Sunday ; and because
some people travel on the Day of Rest it
butchers some other people when the Day
of Rest is over. Truly, the parson makes us
tired ; likewise, he gives us cold feet. He has a
steady theory that the Almighty is more muffled
in His language than even a hawker with an im-
pediment in his speech. Though He could tell
His purpose clearly it seems that, out of pure
cussedness, He won’t do it, but simply kills a lot
of people and leaves the community to guess why
He did it, and howto prevent Him killing a lot
more. This arrangement may give the parson a
steady job as interpreter; but it seems a pretty
rough thing to say about God. And one begins
to feel doubtful about the interpreter when one
notes his lamentable tendency to decide that
Providence always meant the same thing that he
meant himself.

Melbourne’s mortal fear of its railways
was shown on Tuesday night last week. On that
evening a cold, thick fog descended and wrapped
itself round the city of Dreadful Smash, and
people on their way to the railway station halted
and looked at each other with alarmed faces.
Was it “good enough” to get into a railway
train? “Not good enough,” they decided, for
you couldn’t see half-way across the narrowest
streets, and whoever travelled in a train was
haunted by the vision of a hostile engine pouncing
on him from behind. Those who could afford it
called hansoms, and so risked the Cabby’s neck as
well as their own ; others chose the trams, which
went like noisy wraiths, with banging bells and
bellowing gripmen, through the blind, damp veil.
Many who lived within a mile or two of the city
groped their ways homeward in the mist, and
sneezed and coughed for two days aftewards. It
was all very illogical, and very understandable,
for Melbourne has a dreadful funk. The crews
of a fleet could have had a healthy jamboree with
the ticket-money the Victorian railways lost on
Tuesday night.

The Outback can still breed some true
mates. One of them was heard of at Parkes
(N.8.W.) the other day. With another man—a
good deal older than himself—he had tramped
into Forbes looking for work. On the way the
older man’s boots gave out, so the mate bought
him a pair, and then had only a few shillings left.
They didn’t get the work they were after, so they
decided to give their feet a rest and take the rail
to Parkes. The older man’s fare was fixed up all
right; but the young one quietly took a ticket
as far as his money would stretch, and then iwith
a breezy “So long!” he got out and walked.
The older man rode on ; but bad luck had got him
down, and when his mate turned up at Parkes he
was a corpse. The Coroner’s Court said it was
suicide on the part of one, and mighty fine and
generous behavior on the part of the other ; and
witnesses and others insisted on dropping their
fees and some odd coins into the white man’s
empty hat.
WHA FOR!
HOUSEWIFE: “ I’m afraid I shall hare to give
you up, John. Your vegetables have become
very dear since you joined the church."
SIN FAT (in disgust): “ Wha’ for—wha' for
wantce ‘dcur brother ’ all day Sunday, ‘ cheap
Chinee’ all day Monday?"
“10-2-4”; The “last wishes” of James
Ralli, a Paris artist, who died last month, ap-
pealed to me. At the end of his will he said :
Let me be placed in my coffin as soon after my death
as is possible, and let nobody be let into m3' room before
lam put in my coffin. Let no picture be made of my
body', and let me be buried in the shortest time possible.
And do not weep for me. I have lived a happ3’ enough
life. .. . And I should be thoroughly pleased if no one
wore marks of mourning for me. j
To me, one of the main terrors of death
has always been the knowledge that when
I am an icy and horrible corpse those
whom I have liked best in life, and
whose kindly remembrances I most
crave, will be driven by an idiotic
custom to come and visit me. (Of
course I may get drowned at
sea, or blown to pieces, or
incinerated, or eaten by some-
thing or someone, or hanged,
in which case my friends
will be spared a post-mor-
tem view of me ; but I am
assuming my end to be
normal.) The scent of
the flowers, whose
hideous significance
is missed by so
many, won’t avail to
drown the marrow-
freezing odor of
death; the only
effect will be to make
flower-lovers loathe
certain blooms till
the recollection of
the conditions under
which they last saw
them shall have
faded away. In my
opinion, none bu t
doctors, nurses and
undertakers should
be suffered to con-
sort with corpses,
and even they
shouldn’t be allowed
a moment longer with
the remains than is
necessary to identify
them as genuine and
pass them on to the hone-yard. The last lingering
interview with the cadaver is an affliction to
those who indulge in it—whatever they may
hypocritically allege to the contrary. It doesn’t
gratify the corpse, and, as above mentioned, to
many of us who are prospective corpses it consti-
tutes a very real unpleasantness.
“ Melb ” breaks out into a riot of capitals :
There is a sumptuous new Pekin Caf6 in Russell-street
with a wondrous Menu of 28 items. The tariff ranges
from threepence to ten shillings a nob. The titles are
given in Chinese, with the correct pronunciation in ordi-
nary letters. The only threepenny dish is Farn, or Rice.
Next are the Ninepennies, as follow: Woon Boon,
Macaroni Patties in Soup, with small plate of Duck and
Fowl. (Please excuse me the Duck and Fowl.) “Min”
is Vermicelli Soup with small dish of Duck and Fowl.
“HorTsai Hong” is Oyster Soup. So far for the nimble
Ninepence. From this you bound to the Shilling fare, as
thus: Ki See Min (Vermicelli and Chicken); Ap See Min
(Vermicelli and Duck); Ting Hong Foon (Fine Vermicelli
Soup); Shu Ap (Roast Duck); Bo Ki (Boiled Chicken);
Shu Ge (Roast Pork). The next advance is to the
Eighteenpenn3’, for which you get Foo Yung Hi (Lobster
Braized). But you must give two hours’ notice if you
want Foo Yung Hi. The only Two Shilling item is Darp
Suey, or Braized Chicken, available in 20 minutes. At
Three Shillings are Chow Woon Hoon, or Fried Macaroni
Patties, and Hi Ngook Min (Vermicelli and Lobster).
Neither of these will be served to less than three per-
sons—Nine Bob in hand. The Four-Shilling item is Tin
Ow Ap Tong (Steamed Duck and Vegetable Soup.) Takes
two hours, and Won’t be served for less than Sixteen
Bob. For Four and Six 3'ou only have a large
dish of Lap Nguey (Steamed Fish). It takes two
hours, and won’t be served for less than Four-
teen Bob. Now see what you get for Five Shillings:
Onl}' Ngeongtoon Kwoo(Mushroom Patties). They take
6 hours to prepare, and will not be served under £l.
Mount to the Six Shilling items. These are Ki Yung Yen
Wor (Edible Birds’ Nests and Chicken Soup); Toon Ap
(Steamed Duck); Chi Bar Ap (Steamed Duck and Ham
Faggots); Ting Wor Hai Tarm (Bfeche-de-Mer and
Chicken Broth); Bou Nguey (Mutton Fish); and Fou
Yung Hi (Braized Chicken and Ham). The Birds’Nests
will not be served under 18s., the Steamed Duck under
365. (!), the Duck and Ham also 365., the B&che-de-Mer
under 245., the Mutton Fish (not Birds) under 245., and
the Braized Chicken and Ham under 245. Time in pre-
paration : Nests 6 hours, Steamed Duck 6 hours, Bfeche-
de-Mer 12 hours, Mutton Fish 12 hours. A Six-and-Six-
penny article is Kum Ngun Bak Ap (Gold and Silver
Pigeon Steamed); it takes 6 hours, and 265. required.
From this there is a rise to 7s. 6d., for Iloi Tarm Bak Up
(Steamed Pigeon and Bfeche-de-Mer) which takes 12 hours,
with a minimum of 30s. On to the items of Ten Shillings,
and let the boldest hold his breath for a time. Hi Yung
Nguey' Chee (Shark Fins and Chicken) takes 24 hours
(the shark, of course, has to be caught). Not served
under £2. Akin is Sarm She Nguey Chee, same price,
with Ham also mixed up. Shark Fin Soup is consider-
ately offered at Bs., with £1 12s. minimum. I’m dis-
appointed in finding there is no crocodile.

The British New Guinea Co.—the big
over-capitalised concern, which paid out an un-
necessary third of a million to promoters and
vendors—has started off just as that kind of co.
might be expected to do. It bought or chartered
—apparently bought—a steamer, the Bentinck,
which turned up at Port Moresby the other day,
laden with foreign goods, clerks, and other alleged
necessaries for the proposed rubber plantations.
Soon after the ship had dropped anchor the hands
mostly went off to see what Papua was like;
and after they had priced a few things
and made an inquiry or two about the
local rates of wages, eight of them made
vigorous remarks about the pay at which they
had been induced to sign on. Also the eight
decided that the best time to kick was the imme-
diate present, and they kicked accordingly. Of
course, they expected to be run in, and they
weren’t disappointed; and, at latest advices,
they were more or less cheerfully doing the 14
days that had been allotted to them. Port
Moresby had viewed the big co. with a lot of sus-
picion before; now the suspicion is deepening
into scorn.
BEHIND THE SCENES.

Mr. Flite! ”
FLITE : “Yes. But, great Scott, if she found ME
here!"
A DREADFUL DITTY.
[FOR THE BULLET IN.]
It, is proposed to ask on tlie census-paper, “ Do you
habitually use alcoholic liquor as a beverage?”—
Argus, 26/7/10.
Can 3-0 U see the census-taker standing firmly on the mat
In a suitof serious pattern and a sober sort of hat,
With his fingers in his whiskers, asking questions cool
and calm.
Of the housewife and her attitude regarding liquid balm ?
“ Tell me, missus, are 3-ou frequently or ever, on your ear ?
Are 3*ou gay and loud and jo3'ful when the bloom is on
the beer?
Do you take it as a tonic, or a luxury or what?
Is your beer-imbibing chronic?
Do you swill, or do you not ! ”
Is the census-taker likely to retain his equipoise
If his bold and pointed questioning the householder
annoys?
Do yon think he should continue when his quarrv, now at
bay,
Grips the door-post as he queries in his too-persistent
way ?
“ Do you never lift the Bottle with a firm, unshaking fist,
Or observe square gin as sugar on your grocer’s weekly'
list?
Do y'ou wander ivhere the beer-leaves grow, or take a
parlor tot ?
Please inform me, do you ever go
Upon the burst or not?”
Do you note the census-taker’s eager, frightened, up-
ward look
As he writes all sorts of figures in his census-taking book ?
Do you notice how he shivers in his plain, unvarnished
shoes,
As he tries to land the lady' in his census-taking noose?
“ Would you tell me, do you soak all day, or only off and
on ?
Do you mix your drinks with water? Do you house a
demijohn?
Do you ever run the rabbit? Do you like it cold, or hot ?
Have you got the sipping habit?
Are you sober, please, or not?”
I can see the census-taker bolting madly for the gate,
With his whiskers waving wildly, in a far from placid
state !
I can hear his hurried hoofbeats grinding down the
gravel-track,
As the perfect temperance lady slings the fire-irons at
his back.
Still he tries to do his duty, fleeing fast, and full of pace—
Can you catch his broken accents as he bolts to save his
face?
“ Pray, madam, do not look upon my questionings as
rot!
Do you shicker very often,
Are you tanked, or are you not ? ”

Breathing Disease.
Infectious diseases are breathed into
the system from those affected with disease
or from bad smells; yet how many women
breathe daily the offensive steam from
common soaps made from rancid fats, and
keep their hands for hours in such solu-
tions, and the clothing from such soap
suds is worn next the tender skin. No
wonder disease and eczema are prevalent!
Users of Sunlight Soap know the differ-
ence between that and the pure, healthful
smell from the vegetable oils and pure
edible fats in Sunlight Soap.
Oh! Many the thorns of Hymeneal
When roses have faded away !
How hard is his lot who’s a talkative wife,
And children who yell all the day!
When all a man’s family is laid up in bed
And life seems too hard to endure,
A hundred to one he would go off his head,
If ’twere not for Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure.
Gentlemen who wish to look smart should
pay a visit to Wild’s Hairdressing Saloon, where
six first-class artists are engaged. The establish-
ment is under Vice-Regal patronage. Address,

“ The Heathen ” : I take this opportunity
of thanking Heaven that Bishop Frodsham, of
North Queensland, has fired a broadside into im-
ported Archbishop Wright over the interminable
row about the Costumes. Mr. Wright, who
comes from a cold country where people take all
sorts of duds seriously, is prepared to argue about
them at great length ; but Frodsham, who labors
in a hot casual corner of the Vineyard, says he
doesn’t care how much official Clobber his men
put on or take off so long as they work steadily
at keeping the phylloxera of Sin off the plants.
Frodsham’s splendid indifference to the Rags of
Contention is a refreshing affair. I’m sorry,
though, that the Townsville pressman who asked
him for his opinion about the vestments didn’t
tackle him also on the subject of candles. A
busy, tropical bishop of the Frodsham type could
have said something memorable about hot, un-
necessary things like candles. Personally, I
think the vestment and candle question would be
solved by sending all the Anglican clergy to
Bourke in the height of the summer and forcing
them to preach the Gospel to one another for
eight hours a day. By the end of that time the
pulpit costume would be a light bathing suit, and
the verger who attempted to set fire to a candle
would fall ’neath a volley of hymn-books.

“The Shover ”: The Richmond (Vic.)
railway wreck has produced the customary crop
of newspaper letters. Per-
haps the most disagreeable of
these was that of an anony-
mous writer to the Argus,
who grunted indignantly
concerning the improper
action of sufferers from shock
in putting forward claims
for cash—actually for hard
cash—when there were more
deserving people with
broken bones to distribute
John Weary’s money
amongst. This letter was
endorsed by another screed
from a Remarkable Lady
who wrote: “It seems a
most extraordinary thing
that people away in the
front of the first trains hould
lodge claims for shock or
spinal complaint, when those
in the rear, where my hus-
band was, should not feel any
ill effects. Although he lost
his hat, and had his clothes
torn in his efforts to relieve
those who were not so for-
tunate as he, there was no mur-
mur of complaint from him, as
he fully recognised that he was
well paid by escaping scot free.”
Well, I know of a Sunshine case
in which the victim was appar-
ently undamaged by the collision,
was able to walk home (from
Sunshine to a southern suburb)
after the accident, and, after a
sleep, went out to do riding work
on the Caulfield racecourse.
This young man sent in no claim
for damages ; but, no less than
12 months later, he began to
suffer from delayed shock, and
his doctors’ bills were con-
siderably more than the
price of a lost hat and a
damaged coat-tail. And
la3t Saturday the papers
reported the death of a
man who was injured in
the Sunshine accident,
and who just crumpled
up and died when his
reoovery was appar-
ently complete. The
man who lost his hat
in the Richmond hor-
ror and left his weskit
impaled on a hat-rack,
ought to restrain his wife from writing foolish
letters. She may be a lone widder, earning her
scanty crust for herself, within 12 months’ time
.'olely by reason of that accident.
The “ Old Soldier ” writes :
It is bard to keep a straight face when reading a paper
in the Fortnightly Review for June by “ S. M. Mitra,’
who ought, judging by his name, to be a high Brahmin,
one of the class which is at the bottom of all the present
Indian rumpus. His idea is that, while Britain is reform-
ing its House of Fords, it cannot do better than call up
some of the alleged “Indian Princes” to sit in it, and
this is why :
“ No one can better explain the thoughts of the Indian
millions than their natural rulers, the Indian Princes.
For, through confidence, the latter know the innermost
thoughts of the former.”
“ Natural rulers ” is good. There is only one native
state in India 200 years old—that of Hyderabad—and the
Nizam is a Turk without a single natural tie to bind him
to his people. He is a Muhamadan, and a foreigner
governing a population of Hindus, to whom he is an un-
clean beast. All India was in the melting-pot during the
Mahratta war, 107 years ago, and all the other States
came into existence since then. As an example, the
great state of Kashmir, with its solid Muhamadan popu-
lation, was sold bodily in 1850 for cash by John Company
to old Gulab Sing of Jamu. In 1825 Amir Khan, an
Afghan chief of mercenaries, or bandits, or whatever you
like to call them, took possession of the native State of
Tonk, and his descendants are Nawabs there to this day.
Here is a hint dropped by Mitra that might be worth
considering by the British Government: —
“The Indian Princes can work through religious influ-
ences, which operate speedily and effectively on the
minds of the masses ; such influences can be put in mo-
tion by the priestly class at the will of an Indian Prince.
And this might be done secretly without the knowledge
of the British Government, who have been before now
taken by surprise.”
It reads mighty' like a threat.

For 20 minutes, on July 12 last, Frederick
King, of Alexandria(Sydney), beat the horse he had
charge of with the butt end of a whip ; and part of
the time he belabored the wretched animal about
the head. He was proceeded against under the
Traffic Act last week, and fined £lO, plus costs
and witnesses’ expenses, in default two months’
hard labor. On his asking 14 days to pay, the
magistrate said :
I’d give you double that time in gaol if I could do so.
You are a coward to treat a dumb animal like that. I’ll
certainly give you no time to pay.
King got the maximum penalty allowed by the
law, which was all to the good, but the penalty
isn’t nearly big enough. Any day in the streets
where carters congregate, the spectacle is offered
of horses having their heavily-bitted jaws torn at,
or their faces lashed or punched, or their
stomachs kicked. Anywhere about the city a
horse has to be almost larne enough to lie down
before the police interview the driver. Galled
shoulders and sore backs are common ; and hardly
anyone gets called to account for them, for the
local John Hop knows little about horses, and,
anyhow, is largely occupied raiding fan-tan
establishments. If a private citizen interferes he
gets no satisfaction and a heap of blasphemy from
the horse-torturer, and the minimum of public
sympathy. Sydney would be a more edifying
place and a pleasanter one to live in if people
who were convicted of needlessly ill-treating
animals could be handed, say, six months without
the option.
FILIAL GENER-
OSITY.
“ Your father looks
very nice with his grey
hairs.”
“ Yes, dear old chap! I
gave him those.”
Adelaide has had an aviation horror on a
small scale. The first public attempt at flying
in S. Aus. was made on Cheltenham racecourse,
and the arrangements for controlling the crowd
were primitive. Also it appears, obviously
enough, that when a long, light body rears its
front part into the air, then, if there is any wind
at all, it must pivot round on its back
wheels before they have a chance to rise.
That is what happened. The machine slewed
and charged the crowd. Nevertheless, only one boy
was badly hurt. He got into the propeller, which
was revolving at several miles a minute. The
collision smashed the light walnut blades; but
the boy lost his right hand first. This tragedy of
popular science recalls Perceval Landon’s grim
horror of the gyroscope which, exhibited in a
town hall, slipped off its stand, took charge, and
killed the whole assembly.

Between Attorney - General Drysdale
Brown, Premier Weary, Coroner Cole and a shoal
of legal sharks, the inquiry into the Richmond
(Vic.) railway disaster has got itself into a tangle.
Coroner Cole first set out to hold his inquest, and,
having opened it, promptly adjourned it for an
unconscionable five weeks, chiefly at the desire of
numerous Gents One. This extensive adjourn-
ment meeting with public disapproval, Brown
and Weary spoke firmly to Cole, who thereupon
reopened the inquest next day, and adjourned it
for 10 days. Also, he excused one juryman who
desired to take a holiday, and said he would pro-
ceed with six. This second adjournment dis-
pleased Weary and Brown; so, after getting
“ eminent counsel’s ” opinion, they immediately
appointed P.M. Moore, Port-Engineer Maclean
and University-Demonstrator Higgins to sit as a
Board of Inquiry. This leaves two presumably
legal bodies inquiring into one catastrophe.
Brown and Weary are, however, working on the
opinion of “eminent counsel” aforesaid —Mit-
chell, K.C.—to the effect that Cole’s re-adjourn-
ment of the inquest and discharge of a juryman
have invalidated the whole proceedings, and that
to hold an inquest now a body must be exhumed,
a new jury empanelled, and the whole business
started afresh. Coroner Cole, however, dissents
from this view, and proposes to go on with his in-
quest as if nothing had happened and the Attorney-
General and Premier didn’t exist. He has
power to call witnesses, and to gaol them if they
don’t appear. Also, he can commit for trial, for
murder, manslaughter or any other felony;
whereas Brown’s Board cannot punish contemptu-
ous or recalcitrant witnesses save by fining them
£lO a-piece, and it can’t commit anybody for trial
for anything. It can only make a report and
recommendations; but on those recommendations
Attorney-General J. Drysdale Brown can act
pretty much as he likes. And the point of that
will lie in the application thereof.

The Corangamite (Vic.) Labor Leagues re-
cently held their conference on a Sunday, for the
good and sufficient reason that a number of the
members couldn’t attend on any other day ; and
various clerics became so mad that they preached
special sermons concerning theiniquity. About the
same time this appeared in the Society column
of Melbourne Leader :
On the Sunday previous to the wedding, Judge and
Miss Chomley gave a large At Home in honor of the bride.
About 200 guests were present. . . . Tea was served in the
dining-room. . . . Contributing to an excellent musical
programme were . . . Amongst the guests were . . .
And no parson preached any special sermon worth
a hunk of mud.
The old, old policy of baby-prohibition,
this time from the Victorian police department: —
WARDSMAN wanted at Police Hospital, Vic-
toria Barracks, St. Kilda-road. Salary, £75 per
year with board. Applicants must be single, etc.
It is a wonder the unfortunate baby ever con-
trives to get born at all, when one considers the
number of awful bosses who fine the father in his
whole salary if baby happens.
Melbourne City Council may not be the
most gradual body on earth, but it is as near the
limit as anyone need wish to get. Two years ago
the Taxicab Co. asked it to draw up regulations
and issue licenses for its vehicles, and the regu-
lations haven’t been drawn up yet. If the council
hasn’t brains enough to accomplish that small
job, it could borrow the by-laws of London or
New York, or go-ahead little Toowoomba,
and adopt them, but it doesn’t even do that.
Also, it has now spent three years pondering over
some up-to-date building regulations, those now
in use being 40 years old, like the city’s water-
mains. And it still ponders ponderously.
If Hawley Crippen, the man whose wife’s
remains were found in the cellar of his London
house, comes to the gallows he will have the dis-
tinction of being the first man to be hanged by wire-
less telegraphy, just as Tawell was the first to be
scragged by the ordinary wire. It was by the
sending of airgrams to vessels at sea that the
authorities first got on the track of Crippen.
Then will follow the first murderer captured by
airship, or the first one identified by having his
photograph telephoned or telegraphed. Quite a
large new field is opening up before the active
homicide. The world has moved since he used to
flee on foot over a roadless land with the avenger
of blood howling personally in his wake.

One has to go abroad to get patriotic sen-
timent, as well as news, nowadays. The keenest
piece of criticism on the gorgeous new infant
school, opened last weekatFootseray (Vic.), came
from Scotchman Gibson-Carmichael. He ob-
served the choice wall decorations, depicting an
English “meet” and fox-hunters lounging round
an ale-house, and remarked: “They might have
painted a scene more typical of Australia.” That
was all; but, coming from an imported Governor,
it ought to be enough.
JOE COOK.
(An Uncharitable Rhyme.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If you hear a voice complaining: like a hoarse and angry
rook,
That’s Cook.
He wails and shrieks and yammers like a voluble yahoo,
And his speech is Lamentations, chapters 1 to 42 :
Did you catch the name correctly ?—l’ll repeat it just for
you :
Joe Cook !
Does an awesome ululation come from out a darksome
nook?
’Tis Cook.
And no plan is ever mooted but he moaneth his dissent ;
It is always frosty Winter in his bitter discontent.
Who’s the Gnawer and the Nagger and the Nark in
Parliament?
Job Cook !
He gazes upon Office with a sad and hungry look,
Does Cook.
Ten years of weary drudgery his heart was forced to
know
For one sweet year of office with a big port-fol-i-o;
But whom did the electors mean when fierce they
shouted, “ Go ”?
Joe Cook.
Once more in Opposition, by Fortune quite forsook,
Sits Cook.
He cannot cease to whimper, and he will not cease to
nag,
For he fain would be a Martyr to the torture of the Gag ;
And, therefore, who has got the tongue which oftenest
doth wag?—
Job Cook!

ABORIGIN
ALITIES
“ Gr.R.F.”: In the ’Bos of last century,
when the Torres Strait shellers first invaded
N.-W. waters after the valuable golden-lipped
shell, Broome, the now prosperous township on
Roebuck Bay, was a wild and woolly place. The
divers in those days were mostly white men, who
were paid £3 per 100 for the shells won.
They made big money, but the most of it
went on “square face,” and whilst under
the influence they played havoc with the
nerves of the more sedate residents, ihe Gov-
eminent vessel that had control of the pearling
grounds was called the Meda, and was com-
manded by a genial mariner named Smith. Ever
so many people are named Smith. Prior to its
first visit to Broome, which was at that time so
isolated that it did not even have telegraphic
communication with' civilisation, a rumor was cir-
culated and believed that some pi metical pearler
was about to make a raid on the place, as in the old
buccaneer days, and lift the shell, which in those
times of faulty steamer-service was stacked on the
beach in large quantities waiting shipment. Dire
were the threats that were uttered by the shellers
of what they would do to any vessel that entered
the bay with felonious intent, and their rifles and
revolvers were kept handy. One morning, on the
top of the flood-tide, the Meda, then a stranger to
all Broomeites, was seen coming in from sea
straight towards the creek where the shell was
stacked. Everybody and his dog turned out, and
speculation ran high. Then their worst suspicions
were confirmed, for a black flag, emblazoned
with the skull and cross-bones, was broken
out at. the main truck. “ She’s a pirate!” was
the cry ; and as the astonished skipper conned his
vessel to the anchorage, he was greeted with a
perfect hail of bullets. “Damn it, are all those
fools drunk?” he asked, turning to a diver named
Hatch whom he had picked up at Whistler’s
Creek to pilot him into Broome. “ What the hell
are you firing at ? ” he yelled to the crowd ashore
as a second volley blazed forth (the vessel by this
time had swung to the rush of the tide, and was
pulling heavily at its anchor close to the shore).
“ Who are you?” yelled back old Walton of the
Vixen, gazing in bewilderment from Smith’s smart
uniform to the black flag aloft. “What are you
flying that damn thing for?” Then Smith saw
the, joke that had been perpetrated on him by
Hatch, who', whilst Smith swore in a manner
most unbecoming of the master of a Government
ship, sat at the table in the cuddy below drinking
gin and singing in a sweet tenor voice, “There’s
a Light in the Window Burns Brightly for Me.”

“ Maitai ” : Beer, wine, whisky and pain-
killer—l’ve tried ’em all; but the queerest Tangle-
foot I’ve swallowed is a concoction —branded
wine—made by Austrians. Whilst north of
Auckland (M.L.) I struck a camp of Austrian
gumdiggers celebrating, in the old way, the birth-
day of some Austrian potentate. I quaffed a
couple of glasses of wine made on the premises.
The first glass maefe me just mellow ; but when I
had lowered the second glass I couldn’t stand —
my legs seemed as if they had broken their moor-
ings. Peculiarly enough, my head remained un-
affected. Following morning the sting of the
wine had left me, but later I had a glass of
temperance liquid, and again gradually the power
stole out of my legs. The porter—a melancholy
cuss—carried me to bed and said a prayer on my
behalf. By next day I had recovered ; but this
Austrian liquid has given me blue funk, and I
reckon its originator ought to be flogged with a
bunch of open razors.
A FEMININE SUGGESTION.
MR. JUMBUCK (proudly): “ Ain't he a beauty!"
CITY VISITOR: “ Yes, indeed; but he'd look ever
so much nicer if those creases weve ironed out.
“ Yectis ” : The “ paper trick ” for drinks
is an aged and respectable swindle, and deserves
honorable mention among ingenious devices for
beguiling the innocent. Take a strip of paper a
foot long and an inch wide; join the ends with
stamp-paper so as to form a loop, but before join-
ing give one end a half turn, so that you have a
loop with a spiral twist in it. Now, cut with
scissors all round exactly half-way between the
two borders, and what do you get ? Two loops,
of course, say nine mugs out of 10 ; but you don’t.
The astonishment of the mug who has backed his
ooinion is worth seeing. Also, his beer is worth
drinking.
ANOTHER PROVERB GONE WRONG.
TOWNIE (in the course of conversation): "Yes, but you
know familiarity breeds contempt.”
WANDERER: “ Oh, that’s a lot o’ bosh! Take pubs, f' instance. I’ve bin familiar with pubs
fer the last 30 years, and I ain’t got a scrap of contempt for ’em!”
“ Maitai ” : I’ve seen a score of quaint
horse-meetings, but the one I saw in the King
Country (Maoriland) t’other day lowers the others
to zero. It was run entirely by the brown man
on brown man rules. I had a pass to the grand
stand reserved for fashionable rangitaras. The
stand was an ill-us,ed hay loft of a forgotten
period, but its importance was freely referred
to. In the left-hand corner three musi-
cians were ensconced. They designated
themselves “The King Country Or-
chestra.” Each had a concertina.
and by the attitude they struck
they were prepared to play all
and sundry into eternity. The
paddock—which hadn’t been
cleared of stumps and cow-
wreckage—held about 500
brown men and their wa-
hines. They were all agog
with a genuine brand of
nigger excitement, and the
scene resembled more a
muster of gay old canni-
bals than a horse meeting.
At the sound of a heavy-
tongued hell the concertinas
started their soul-destroying
music. Shrieks from the
crowd injured the atmos-
phere. “ Kia Ora!” jelled
the nigger gathering, and
away went a dozen steeds.
As the winner was coming
in—more than 30yds. ahead
of the second nag—a pakeha-
Maori whispered something
to, me about oats. His
speechlqt was overheard by
those next us, and it almost
caused a revolution. Prompt-
ly a half-dozen foaming war-
riors grabbed him savagely
and emptied him on the earth
below. I climbed out of
the stand and joined the
surging, furious crowd, on
principle. I discovered that
a protest had been lodged
on the ground that the winning horse had
had a feed of oats the night before. A fearsome
harangue started among stewards, judges,
jockeys and lookers-on, and several were either
injured or threatened with injury. When it was
announced that the protest was disallowed there
was pandemonium. For 15 minutes everybody
pummelled everybody else. Just as the local con-
stable began collecting an account of the affair I
skedaddled.
“ Puketapu’s ” orgie :
At the time I write of, Karamea was a special settle-
ment on the West Coast of Maoiilarid. Once every three
months a small steamer called at the settlement with
provisions, including liquor, and the day of its arrival
was the occasion of a public spree on an extended scale.
I reached there one evening, all rags and tatters, in com-
pany with a surveyor—a very religious man but, strangely
enough, a very good man—and as we crossed the creek
we knew that the periodical steamer was in. Nothing
could have been clearer. “Drunks” were everywhere—
some lying on their ears in the roadway, some capering
on the verandah of the little pub, some half-naked,
some fighting, some cursing, some singing, some crying
—a rare old twin-action jag. As we walked towards the
shanty a local celebrity known as “The Gunner” met
us, and pulling a bottle of whisky from under his
whiskers, invited us to “pouch a drop or two.” We
did ; in fact, we pouched the lot, and left “The Gunner”
sitting on the roadside weeping bitterly beside the empty
bottle. I’ve been in some hot schools one place and
another, but that bush joint in Karamea secures my re-
commendation as the star item. The grog would have
burned its way through an ice-chest; the tap-room and
bar were crowded ; the smell of booze-sizzled humanity
was thick and blue and fur-lined. As a man in a
dream or a stupor, I found myself playing Yankee
grab for drinks with a big Dutchman and the
parson’s son. The parson’s son threw 15 twice running,
after throwing 10, 8, 17. I pulled put, and started to
back his dice at a quid a throw with the landlord, who
was half-sozzled himself. 1 forget how much I won, but
it must have been considerable, because for several
thousand years I sat there while round me grew piles of
gold with drunken demons dancing on the top of them.
Grotesque faces slipped into the lamplight, and were
pursued by giant fists that were attached to no arms.
Time was not, but the crash of worlds (or bottles) was
marked by the dying yell of the Obliterated. And then
1 fell, and fell into Space that changed its hue as I sped
to its foundations. When I woke it was broad daylight.
A kiwi was picking at my boot, and the snow-wind from
the ranges had frozen a great splash of blood across my
face.

“ Clay pan ” : The absence of locks on the
Darling lias a sad effect on the shipping of the
Big Trickle. At almost every town from Bre-
warrina to Menindie I saw large boats moored
from the wharves, trees, etc., waiting for a rise.
The smaller boats, however, manage to get a
river all the year round. Many of these are
family-owned. Among the fleet is a small boat
known as the Wave. It is managed solely by mem-
bers of the skipper’s family. His daughters can
be seen taking their turn at the wheel by day,
carefully steering their floating home clear of all
danger, while the old man takes charge of the
barge they have in tow. The hoys take the wheel
through the long night. One hears a lot regard-
ing the hardy bush womenfolk, but little is said
about those brave little women whose destiny it
is to “ take the wheel,” “flush the decks,” etc., on
some screeching river tub in the interior of this
land of vast resources. ,
AN OLD MASTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were cartin’ lar.hes and palin’s from the slopes of
Mount St. Leonard,
With our axles near the road-bed and the mud as stiff
as glue ;
And our bullocks weren’t precisely what you’d call con-
ditioned nicely,
And meself and messmate Mitchell had our doubts of
gettin’ through.
It had rained a tidy skyful in the week before we started,
But our tucker-bag depended on the sellin’ of our load ;
So we punched ’em on by inches, liftin’ ’em across the
pinches,
Till we struck the final section of the worst part of the
road.
We were just congratulatin’ one another on the journey,
When we blundered in a pot-hole right within the sight
of goal,
Where the bush-track joins the metal. Mitchell, as he
saw her settle,
Justified his reputation at the peril of his soul.
We were in a glue-pot, certain—red and stiff and most
tenacious;
Over naves and over axles —waggon sittin’ on the road.
“’Struth," says I, “they’ll never lift her. Take a shot
in Hell to shift her.
Nothin’ left us but unyoke ’em and sling off the blessed
load.”
Now, beside our scene of trouble stood a little one-
roomed humpy,
Home of an enfeebled party by the name of Dad McGee.
William was, I pause to mention, livin’ on an old-age
pension
Since he gave up bullock-putichin’ at the age of eighty
three.
Startled by our exclamations, Daddy hobbled from the
shanty,
Hobbled out and over to us on his old rheumatic pins,
Shadin’ his old eyes and peerin’ here and there around
the clearin’,
While we watched his consternation with half-sympa-
thetic grins.
“Eh! Wot’s happened now?” he quavered, in a weak
and shaky treble,
Gazin’ where the stranded waggon looked like some half-
foundered ship.
Then the state o’ things he spotted. “ Looks,” he says,
“like you was potted.”
And he toddled up to Mitchell. “Here,” said he,
“ gimme that whip.”
Mitchell, bein’ out o’ patience, flung a glance of anger at
him,
Followed by some fancy language of his very choicest
brand.
Then old Daddy seemed to straighten. “ Now,” he
yelled, “ don’t keep me waitin’!
Pass that whip, you blarsted blue-tongue!” Mitchell
put it in his hand.
Well! I’ve heard of transformations; heard of fellers
sort of changin’
In the face of sudden danger or some great emergency ;
Heard the like in song and story and in bush traditions
hoarv,
But I nearly dropped me bundle as I looked at Dad
McGee.
While we gazed he seemed to toughen ; as his fingers
gripped the handle
His old form grew straight and supple, and a light leaped
in his eye :
And he stepped around the waggon, not with footsteps
weak and laggin’,
But with firm, determined carriage, as he flung the whip
on high.
Now he swung the leaders over, while the whip-lash
snarled and volleyed ;
And they answered like one bullock, strainin’to each
crack and clout ;
And he kept his cursin’ till old Brindle made a
blunder ;
Then I thought all Hell had hit me, and the master
opened out.
And the language ! O, the language ! I have known
some noble eursers—
“ Hell-fire ” Mac and “ Cursin’ ” Brogan— men of bound-
less blasphemee,
Full of fancy exclamations, trimmed with frills and
decorations ;
But their talk was childish prattle to that language of
McGee.
In a trance stood messmate Mitchell; seemed to me I
must be dreantin’;
While the wondrous words and phrases only genius could
loose
Roared and rumbled fast and faster in the throat of that
Old Master —
Oaths and curses tipped with lightning, cracklin’flames
of fierce abuse.
Then we knew the man before us was a Master of our
callin’;
One of those great lords of language gone for ever from
Outback ;
Heroes of an ancient order ; men who punched across the
border;
Vanished giants of the ’sixties ; puncher-princes of the
track.
Now we heard the timbers strainin’, heard the waggon’s
loud complainin’,
And the Master cried triumphant, as lie swung ’em into
line,
As they dug their toes into it, lifted her, and pulled her
through it:
“That’s the way we uster do it in the days o’ sixtv-
riine ! ”
Near the foot of Mount St. Leonard lives an old, en-
feebled party
Who retired from bullock punchin’ at the age of eighty-
three.
If you seek him folk will mention, merely, that lie draws
the pension ;
But to us he looms a Master —Prince of Punchers, Dad
McGee!
VICTORIA.

“ Dux ” : The best perfume for the Maori,
after eating dried shark, is violet. Henare, the
bloated landowner, drops from his motor-car, and,
striding into the chemist’s shop, demands: “Te
pottle of scent —you know—te goot tink (stink).
Te taughter she go to big tarnce, Waitara. She
liket te wiolet. That te good tink ; smell ’trong
(strong). Orrite.” I’ve sold hundreds of bottles
of scent to the tribe, but never anything save the
violet “tink.”
ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF
TEMPERANCE.
WILLIAM WOWSER : “O , my pore friend , look at
me. I have never touched a drop of drink
in my life.”
THE SATURATED: “I shee (hic). Anurrer
’orrible exshample, etshetera! ”
At the one lone hotel which decks the
town of Port Moresby (Papua) there are two
tariffs. As the proprietor puts it, the price is
“£5 10s. with the blokes, and £6 10s. with
the gents in the coffee-room.” The differ-
ence lies in the fact that a gent gets a serviette
and a bloke doesn’t. On the other hand, there is
a serious drawback about being a gent. The
gents’ food has to be carried by the nigger
through the blokes’ dining apartment on its way
to the coffee-room, and if anything is passing
which doesn’t smell so bad as usual, it is liable to
be rushed by the blokes and confiscated. Taking
one consideration with another, it is perhaps best
to be a gent-bloke (he might be called gloke
for short)—that is, to be a bloke at meal times and
a gent in the coffee-room on all other occasions.
A LARGE ORDER.
BUNG (in bitter protest at the size of Braggart's nip):
"'Ere — ere’s threepence change for per! I always make a
reduction to me ’olesde customers.”
Marloo ” : George Simpson and Paddy
McAlone were swopping lies by the fire; and
when it came to Simpson’s lie he fired off the
following : “ Funnell and me was drawring wheat
into Tamworth about 20 years back. One night
we was camped five miles out. In the morning,
when we started to round up the teams, I hap-
pened to forget me weed, so I canters back to the
waggon for it. A big Chow, who must have
watched us leaving, was just doing a grease with
our tucker-bag and billycan. I jumped off,
grabbed a bit of rope, copped the Chink and tied
up his hands and legs. When we had yoked up,
I put it to Billy Funnell that we dump the bloke
in the creek, but Bill said he was too
scared after the last one that we dropped in
and never saw no more. So we stood
him against the back wheel, lashed
him to the spokes, and brought him
down to ther Johns.” McAlone, who
was jealous of Simpson’s reputation as
a liar, thought his chance had come
to bowl his rival out, so he remarked :
“ I suppose it was a corpse you handed
to the cops? You couldn’t rope a big
Chink to a wheel without him overlap-
ping.” But Simpson, who was a man
of resource, said : “Well, yer see,
Paddy, it was all downhill, and we had
the wheels chocked.” But Paddy had
another bomb. “What game,” he
said; “there ain’t no road with a
five-mile descent leading into Tam-
worth.” “ Tamworth,” snarled Simp-
son; “did I say Tamworth, boys”?
The boys agreed that he did. “My
mistake; I’ve never been there. It was
Toowoomba I meant.” McAlone hadn’t
been at Toowoomba.

In reply to “B. Cabonne ” re
Lightning Ridge (N.S.W.) Quadrille Club. There
is no quadrille club in Lightning Ridge, and never
has been. He probably refers to the Entertain-
ing and Debating Society, initiation fee 2s. 6d.,
and Is. per month membership fee. Male mem-
bers occasionally try to teach their friends how to
dance. No ladies are admitted on these occasions.
I can only find records of two persons who asked
for a refund and were refused. One was “fired
out” of the Institute for drunken and black-
guardly conduct; the other for having been dis-
covered abstracting petty cash from the care-
taker’s till. If “B. Cabonne” was either of
these the position of affairs becomes clear at once.
* * * *
“ Edyson ” : Oliver Lightbody was the
most impulsive man I ever knew. His im-
pulsiveness made history at Queenbee. The
affair was largely due to Kyley’s capacity for
making mischief. Kylev was not too sober when
he came to the sleeper-cutter’s camp at Two-up,
and his eyesight was never good anyhow. He
said he had seen Mrs. Lightbody running off with
Heimer, the young Dutchman at Bark Hut.
Here Lightbody’s impulsiveness got to work. He
knocked Kyley out for insulting his wife and
then started off. He returned in 11 months and
four days—returned to his own skillion home at
Queenbee, and found his wife plunging in a wash-
tub at the kitchen door. Mrs. Lightbody
was the reverse of her husband. “ Hello,
Ollie,” she said calmly, and went on soap-,
ing the goods. Presently she added: “You
back?” She rubbed for a minute, and then
asked: “Where yen bin?” Lightbody was
gaping at her as if she was a ghost. “I’ve been
chasin'Heimer,” he said ; “Heimer and you. I
chased him to Brisbane, an’ from Brisbane to
Katoomba, ’n’ from Katoomba t’ Day Dawn.”
“ You never caught him,” said Mrs. Lightbody.
“Why, he’s never bin away. And here iv I bin
all this time wondering what had become of yell.”
Then Lightbody leaned up against the house and
kicked himself vehemently for three minutes.

‘ ‘ Logan ” : Where is this Outback I read so
much about ? I have been west as far as Boulia,
and even there people waved their hands west-
ward and talked of Outback. I believe the man
from the east coast goes looking for Outback till
lie reaches Perth, and the man from the west goes
looking for it till he sights the outlying tramcars
of Sydney, and neither finds it. It isn’t there.
There never was any such place.
“F.J.U.”: The curse of Cow, which
blights the existence of so many youngsters in
New South Wales (vide the periodical reports of
inspectors of schools on the compulsory clauses of
the Education Act) roosts like a cwt. of devils
on Taranaki, the great cow-spanking portion of
Maoriland. Hundreds of children in that district
are stunted and dwarfed mentally and physically
before they are in
their teens. I have
seen them hoard
,the train at way-
side stations on
their road to
school, staring
red-eyed at les-
sons they should
have learned over-
night, or drooping'
towards the sleep
from which they
had been driven at
homeby the national
dragon. Another re-
sult of the she-bull
curse is wife drudgery.
Numbers of young Couples
get married every year
and go milking on shares with cow-owning
cookies, getting two-fifths of the monthly milk
cheque (£4O in the £100) and half the proceeds
from the sale of calves and pigs. A few years of
this cow drudgery age the women prematurely,
and make them haggard and unfit to rear
children. In M.L., the fearfully inflated values
are responsible for many of the evils of cowism.
Half the small dairymen are struggling under
a crushing load of interest due to the stock
auctioneers, who have liens all over the
country. While the price of butter holds
up, the load can be carried somehow ; but if
there comes a slump, the crash of fallen
bundles will be like a glass factory going
home drunk.
In Bathurst (N.S.W.), recently, the Liquor
Defence League members unanimously,resolved—
To withhold their patronage and support from trades-
men or others who are known to be in favor of reduction
or no-license, or who in any shape or form support the
no-license party.
In fact, the Rechabites are to be boycotted. If
the movement spreads it will hit Cold Tea hard.
The up-country pub-keeper wields a lot of influence
in his own sphere. At present he feels he is up
against it. His livelihood shudaersin the balance.
He may be relied on to battle desperately. Not
only will he callously decline, henceforth, to
supply militant teetotal families with alcohol, but
he may be relied on to interfere with their com-
fort in other ways. Even if he doesn’t refuse
accommodation to the bagman who does business
with the enemy, he will make things so dashed
uncomfortable for that trader that he will shy off
blue-ribbon establishments with horror. In the
average baekblocks town about 75 per cent, of
adult males frequent one or more of the hotels,
and use them as clubs. Nothing will be simpler
than for Bung to enroll these patrons of his as
members of a Booze Protection Association, and
pledge them to withdraw their custom from
saintly Mr. Brown, who vends groceries and
loathes beer; and his chapel mate, good Ber-
ruther Jones, who bakes for a crust and regards
fermented wine as an abomination beforethe Lord.
Even the Rechabite who drops public proselytising
and seeks to smite the Der-rink fiend sub rosa , as
it were, will not be safe. His whispered words
of warning will be fraught with financial peril.
The Snares and pitfalls, lurking ready to betray
him to the ungodly, will be as numerous as the
local sly-grog shops.
“ Developer ” writes
Hill End (New South Wales) figures by “Fossicker”
are, in the main, correct. Australia’s" first alluvial
field was in the district, and the first Australian void
in matrix was found on Hawkin’s Hill by Bill Adams
some considerable time after the Battle of Waterloo. He
is still alive to tell the tale. Alluvial regulations were
used, hence more than 20 claims in about 20 acres and
they produced over 20 tons of gold. Bill was too young
to get a claim. Very little gold was got near the surface.
The rich gold started in Carroll and Beard’s claim at less
than 100 ft. The run of gold unmistakably dipped
north with an eastern strike and underlay;
hence it was a little deeper in Krohmann’s, and'
deeper still in Beyer’s and Holtermann’s, and was
worked down to 850 ft. in the Monte Cristo, Rawsthorne’s
and Brown’s. From this end of the Hill, quartz contain-
ing 7J tons of gold was packed to the batteries higher
up. In the middle claims—Rampant Lion, Paxton, Star
of Peace and others —the run of gold was worked nearly
another 100 ft. deeper, and so on through Fisher and
Beard’s, Hermann’s, Mathewson’s and others. The rich
gold was continuous in one vein or another for 1500 ft. in
length. Then the hill rises suddenly about 160 ft. At
this end none of the shafts are deep enough to pick
up this run of gold, if it exists, and there is
no break in the country to prevent it existing.
True, the veins are all small, but as they were enriched
they increased in number. In Krohmann’s and in
several other claims there are workings still standing
from 20ft. to 30ft. wide. Hill End had a fine short-lived
boom. It was pegged for 20 miles, and there were over
1000 companies. Though nine-tenths of the gold came
from the claims in the 20 acres, not one of them pros-
pected 200 ft. deeper than where the gold gave out; and
in several of them the veins from which something like
£2,000,000 were taken can be seen in the bottom levels,
and although not rich, they are all gold-hearing. In the
light of the present, Hill End is a monument of the
appalling gold-mining ignorance of 40 years ago.
Nearly every claim in that small area' was sold
in Sydney at prices running from £BO,OOO to
£160,000, and none had any working capital. Brown got
£60,000 for his 30ft. area. They have never been aban-
doned, and several have been held for many years by
culling over mullock. There were half a dozen companies
formed to drive tunnels great distances, and they all
died with the boom. One of these tunnels, after four or
five of the claims had amalgamated, has been extended
through the schistose slate belt containing the veins. A
drive was taken north towards the Golden Ville. Here a
vein that had been poor for 100 ft. above again made gold
to the extent of 12oz. to the ton. The famous area
is now held by about half a dozen different parties,
and it is reported that, with the ground further
north, it has been bonded by somebody who
has put up money and hopes to do something.
If this is true, then it is the best gold mining prospect in
Australia. There is only one way to prove the field. The
Turon River tunnel scheme, which the Government
offered to subsidise to the extent of £30,000, is too costly,
and is not warranted. My way is this: Clean out the
Star of Peace shaft before fixing the site of the new one.
It will probably be several hundred feet further north.
Sink it 1500 ft., size 15 x 5, cost £15,000, equipment
£5OOO. Crosscut through the belt every 200 ft. below
500 ft. By these means do 10,000 ft. of development work,
cost £30,000. Half a ton of gold would pay for the lot,
and surely a field that has pro-
duced nearly fifty times that
quantity within 400 ft. of
the surface warrants the
work. Meanwhile, put up 10
fairly heavy stamps and run

through the many thousands of tons of mullock on the
surface and in the stopes. It will pay. Also prospect
about the old workings now they are drained by the
tunnel. This might pay for everything.
Adelaide is now so crammed with people,
and houses are so scarce that boarding-house-
keepers spend their spare* time going round
pricing motor-cars and other trifles. In one
dwelling, which claims to be fashionable, there
are 40 men, women and children lodging,
where half that number could not be comfortably
accommodated. Small rooms* have two or
three beds in them, and when a house becomes
vacant, or a rumor circulates that it is liable to be
vacant shortly, the landlord gets up a step-ladder
for fear of being trampled to death.

Old John goes raging up and down, with red fire in his
eye 1
The dry-hash is in other hands ; the grey corn-beef no
more
Wobbles beneath his hasty fist—old Johnny is laid by,
And alien feet are thumping now upon his kitchen-
floor.
Fat -tsak, with onion-garnishings, no longer fills his pan ;
To-day we feed in horrid doubt. With John there was
no fear
That you might miss your duff ; he was a plain, white
sort o’ man
Who loved to call his soul his own—and sometimes
take a beer.
With sago from the flour-mill clean, and, from the
saffron-jar,
Hen-fruit, and sweet milk out of tins, he fed his hungry
crew—
He made us custards, yellow-brown on top. Such
puddings are
Quite pleasing to the eye, and often to the palate, too !'
And now he’s raging up and down, with red fire in his
eye
He’s been like this since j’esterday, when first the row
began.
It seems a shame he’s lost his job. Although, when he
is dry,
He sometimes takes a drop o’ beer, he is a good, white
man 1
To-day we watch our Ohow-made soup with wild and
fearful eyes.
The suet-puddings roll upon the platter, soapy-white.
As we surround rude fragments of pale Chow-bedevilled
pies
We shudder, and we fear there may he dreams for us
to-night 1
Ah, yes, our pub’s in trouble—lots ! —fair in a sordid row,
For Jimmy Chong is cooking here—and old John,
raging by,
Is full of beer and wrath! I thank my stars lam no
Chow,
When John comes cursing down the track, with red fire
in his eye 1

For Colds
and Influenza
The soothing and healing properties of Angier’s Emulsion, combined
with its strengthening and nerve-tonic properties, make it of exceptional
value for colds, coughs and influenza. It not only stops the most obstinate
cough and prevents serious lung mischief, but it promotes appetite, keeps
the digestive organs in a healthy condition, and exerts a wonderfully
invigorating influence upon the general health, Angier's Emulsion is the
very best tonic and restorative after influenza, pneumonia, pleurisy, bron-
chitis or any illness affecting the lungs. It is pleasant to take and agrees
perfectly with delicate stomachs. Of all Chemists, 1/3, 2/9 and 4/6.
ANGIER’S EMULSION
(PETROLEUM WITH HYPO PHOSPHITES.)
Testimonial from a Doctor.
Dear Sirs, — I have used Angier's Emulsion in a number of chest cases, notably in
cough following influenza, and in the later stages of Bronchitis, and have never known
it to fail. In one case of advanced phthisis it gave a good deal of relief. After trial in
a multitude of chest cases I consider it far superior to all other emulsions.

HOOH, DER KAISER.
[For The Buhbti n.]
The Kaiser is convalescent. . . . The Kaiser sleeps with
a Bible alongside his bed. . . . The Kaiser is suffering
from a boil. . . . The Kaiser is drinking mineral waters to
counteract a tendency towards gout. —A few of the
numerous recent cablegrams about the Kaiser.
Ain’t you feeling up to snuff,
Kaiser Bill ?
Is it true or is it bluff,
Kaiser Bill ?
Oh ! dark fears my heart assail,
For perhaps you’re looking pale,
Can’t spring off your royal tail,
Kaiser Bill.
Yes, indeed, it’s very sad,
Kaiser Bill;
And I bet you’re feeling mad,
Kaiser Bill.
It is very hard, I know,
For the ruler of the show
To be told he must go slow,
Kaiser Bill !
And what about that boil,
Kaiser Bill ?
Oh ! it makes my heart recoil,
Kaiser Bill,
To think of all your care,
With that large carbuncle there ;
It’s a very big affair,
Ain’t it, Bill ?
And what about the Book,
Kaiser Bill ?
Is it in the same old nook,
Kaiser Bill?
Does it by your bedside stand
Close beside the royal hand
That guides the Fatherland,
Kaiser Bill ?
Are the Dreadnoughts going well,
Kaiser Bill ?
Are you building them like hell,
Kaiser Bill ?
“ Peace on earth,” the Good Book says,
But perhaps you’ve missed the phrase,
Or your sight is dim some days,
Kaiser Bill !
But you’re not a bad old sport,
Kaiser Bill ;
Though you sometimes do cavort,
Kaiser Bill!
There’s no doubt you are all right,
Though you recognise your might,
And you like the old limelight,
Don’t you, Bill ?
MAORILAND. H. E. BOON.
J. S. Clark, wiiose sovereigns were once
his comfort, has died in poverty at Maryborough
(Vic.). He was on the Victorian goldfields in the
“ roaring ’50’s,” and there laid the foundations
of his fortune. It was a very great fortune, but
it oozed through his trusting fingers. Jabez
B tlfour, of the Liberator Building Society, was
the siren who called to poor old Clark, and left
him with nothing to look forward to but an old-
age pension.
“ Ballon ” disinters a parson :—
Re “Oby’s” par. (B. 28/7/10). The Anglican clergy-
man who invaded Norfolk Island in the ’30’s was the
ltev. H. T. Stiles, not Styles. He was incumbent of St.
Matthew’s, Windsor, at the time. The letter that Samuel
Marsden wrote to him re his appointment to the grue-
some job is somewhere in the Mitchell Library. One of
Mr. Stiles’s sons was an inspector in the Bank of N.S.W.
Another had a property on Monaro and exported cattle ;
and a third was in charge, until recently, of tliedoxology
works at Watson’s Bay, Sydney.
John Forrest laid up much future trouble
for himself in the Reps, last week. Being
in vigorous mood after his dinner, he told the
Labor party that they and their supporters were
fellows of no enterprise; said that Australia was
a fine country for the loafer; and, in general,
created the impression that the several hundred
thousand people who voted Labor last April were
a lot of wasters. The arrogant Bigjohn has three
years before him, in which he may explain this
away, but he will probably find the time insuffi-
cient. His idea of "enterprise” is apparently to
arrive in a country in its infancy, and be there at
the first big land-grab.
“Bloggs” : I have read several hundred
utterly pointless anecdotes about the new King
since Ed. VII. s demise, but in the matter of
hopeless and unashamed asininity the following,
which I have hewn from Sydney Sunday Times,
impresses me as a winner :—
Many stories of his Majesty’s earlv days in the navy
are now being retailed. One of tlie best, of these has,
however, not yet found its way into print. It was in the
days when he was a lieutenant, and he was temporarily
in charge of the navigation of a cruiser. The vessel was
not one of the best for answering its helm, and yawed
badly once or twice. The Admiral of the squadron was
rather a sharp-tempered individual, and at length he
signalled angrily from the flagship for “ the young fool
who was trying to navigate the — to come aboard at
once and explain what the deuce he thought he was
doing.” The Admiral’s astonishment to find Prince
George before him a little later may well be imagined.
“The Admirals astonishment may well be
imagined.” Wlij'? Are embryo kings super-
naturals, who navigate faultlessly from birth ? It
may be urged that there is some joke underlying
this depressing effort. I can’t glimpse it. I wish
the item were alive that I might poison it or kick
it to death, and afterwards deny it Christian
burial.
A gloomy suspicion arises that no great
traveller has really ever been anywhere. Now it
is Sven Hedin, the Swedish explorer of Thibet
and the Pamirs, who has the mud of obloquy
thrown at him, one Scindberg, who has always
stayed at home, declaring that Hedin borrowed
his ideas front Renarts, who hung out his ex-
ploratory shingle a full 190 years ago. And per-
haps Renarts also never went anywhere.
A long-deferred patient from the Sunshine
(Vic.) railway breakage of 1908 has just reached
his end in the Melbourne Hospital. The de-
ceased, Herbert Loughton, was one who emerged
from the gaudy horror with apparently trivial
injuries to his body and nervous system. He
never properly recovered, however, and tubercu-
losis supervened and carried him off. He was
only 39, and, by the way, only received compen-
sation because he was damaged. His widow, it
it said, has not yet received any extra payment
because be is dead.
J. H. SCULLIN, M.H.R., a somewhat vigorous
Labor orator.
Andrew D., one of the landed Badgery
family, died at Sutton Forest (N.S.W.) the other
day. The original Badgery came to Australia
early in last century, and was one of the settlers
who signed an address of welcome to Governor
Bligli in 1800. Alongside of James Badgery’s
signature is that of Thomas N. Pitt, and a cen-
tury after the names of the Pitts and the Bad-
gerys are still connected. But the Badgery
opinion of Bligh changed apparently, as he later
on signed an address to Major Johnston, demand-
ing the arrest of the nautical Governor.
The wonderful collection of Australian
flower pictures, painted by Mrs. Ellis Rowan, is
being sold piecemeal on the premises of Angus
and Robertson, Sydney. The story of the col-
lection is something of a tragedy. Mrs. Rowan
did for Australia’s flowers what Gould did for its
birds. She travelled great distances to paint rare
wild blossoms in their own environment, and very
often one picture would cost £5O or £6O or so in
expenses. Many of them represent rare and
scarce flowers, which are vanishing like the
aborigine—stifled by pricklv-pear, crowded out
by cultivation, or trodden to death by sordid
cow-hoofs. Twice at least Mrs. Rowan received
very large offers from abroad—offers running
into a good many thousands ; but she didn’t
want her works to leave Australia, and
she always reckoned that, one day or another,
some Australian Government would buy the lot
so that they might be kept together and made
available for the public. No such Government
eventuated, however, and things are not so good
with the talented artist as they were ; so one of
the finest collections of flower studies in the
world is being scattered to the four winds —in
many cases at absurdly low prices.
The departure from earthly trouble, at the
age of 89, of Henry Scotland, for 42 years a mem-
ber of the Maoriland Legislative Council, removes
one of the last of the life members of the House
of Decay at Wellington. Theold gentleman—anda
very courteous old gentleman he was—saw much
of the rows and bickerings that took place be-
tween the Provincial Councils and the central
authority, or General Assembly, a position of
things analogous to that now existing in Aus-
tralia between the Commonwealth and the
States. Occasionally the differences of opinion
were of a substantial character, but generally
they were the imaginary grievances of persons
of town-pump importance who couldn’t see fur-
ther than their own back-yard even with a tele-
scope. Scotland (who was a son of George
Scotland, long-ago Chief Justice of Trinidad),
was appointed to the Legislative Council of the
General Assembly in 1868, seven years before the
Provincial Councils were abolished by a popula-
tion that had grown weary of the town-pumpers.
And now, if the deceased gentleman finds any of
them where he’s gone, he’ll have to start empty-
ing them out all over again.
This is a business age. The Taranaki
Anglican Cuukch Magazine, in reporting the
resignation of the vicar of St. Mary's Church,
says :
The following resolution was passed : “ That the vestry
expresses its deep regret upon learning that the state of
Mr. Evans’s health make it necessary for him to take this
step, and trusts that he will benefit by the enforced re-
tirement from his labors in the parish, and be very soon
restored to health and strength.”
It was resolved that an inventory be made of all the
portable property of the church.
The survivors of John McDouall Stuart’s
expedition across Australia have been celebrating
the 48th anniversary of their arrival at the top of
the map. There are five survivors holding on for
the Jubilee celebration. Auld, King and Nash
were present on the 25th ; McGorrery was de-
tained up country by floods, and Billintt is in.
England. On the table was shown (in bottle) a
fragment of the dried beef used on the trip, and
the flag carried through was also on view. Pat
Auld made a fighting speech against the Australian
Government’s plea that it has no fund out of
which to pay pensions to the widows of explorers
who are dead, and also against the transfer of
the Territory to the Commonwealth. “If our
Parliament hands over the Northern Territory
for about 2d. an acre, they ought to put a sum on
the estimates for enlarging the Lunatic Asylum.”
(Cheers and Laughter).
A scrap of old biography :
The death of Sir Henry Tichborne, aged 45, was cabled
last week. Photos of him as a fat-faced small boy ap-
peared in thousands of shop windows and hundreds of
newspapers in the English-speaking world of 40 years ago
No country had a wider knowledge of his infant physi-
ognomy than Australia. For he played the part of “ the
Rightful Heir” in the famous Tichborne comedy drama,
where fat Arthur Orton, the Wagga Wagga butcher,
figured as the Claimant— alias “The Real Sir Roger.”
Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne, who probably got
drowned at sea, was the thin young man whom fat Orton
so ludicrously impersonated, whilst Henry A. J. Doughty
Tichborne, nephew of the missing Roger, was the nipper
who succeeded to the old baronetcy and estates which
Orton claimed. The fat man’s claim, by the way,
had a very small beginning. He merely read, in a
Sydney paper, an advertisement for information re
the missing Roger Tichborne, and having got
hold of a few facts re Roger’s disappearance
he wrote to silly old Lady Tichborne (the mother) in
England, stating th.it he was her long-lost son, and
would trouble her for £5OO to start him in a butchery
business in Wagga. The impostor originally had no idea
of venturing to England, but Lady T., being determined
to “ mother” the first Roger who turned up, sent an old
nigger servant out to Australia to recognise the Claimant.
The doddering hlack man staggered him by crying,
“ Dear young master ! ” as soon as he knew where to look
for the alleged Roger. And so the Wagga butcher took
courage to go to England and start the legal proceedings
which ended in his conviction for perjury. It was a ridi-
culous fraud at the outset, but it gathered a lot of
credence and imposing evidence as it went roiling on.
When it finally blew out there still remained the possi-
bility that Roger Tichborne had not been drowned at sea,
but did actually reach Australia, to the knowledge of
some people, one of whom had given Arthur Orton a few
scraps of information about the shipwrecked wanderer.
OFFICIAL HYPOCRISY.
Following on questions put to the Chief Secretary
recently, as to officers being compelled to work a 24-
hour shift at police stations, thei Inspector-General of
Police asked the men for a “ straightforward and manly ”
statement on the matter. By a four-to-one majority the
officers have declared themselves satisfied with existing
conditions. It is stated, however, that the replies do
not represent the true feelings of the men.— News Item.
The Boss: “ You're 'perfectly satisfied , ain’t
yer ? ”
The 24-hour Shifter (sighting the waddv) :
“ Certainly, sir. Never felt more contented
in me life.”
“Morty Muirhead, the handsome, reck-
less Adelaide lawyer who married John Robb’s
daughter and went down in the Federal Bank
crash, has got his three years’ suspension of a
second-class insolvency certificate reduced to 18
months, of which a year has already run. Chief
Justice Way handed out his judgment in the ap-
peal with a collection of frigid reasons for upset-
ting the Insolvency Commissioner’s judgment.
Muirhead, he remarked, had allowed three friends
—ladies—to pledge their £25,000 fortune for him.
Yes, but that was not an offence in insolvency,
for the other creditors actually benefited. He
had travelled and law-suited recklessly? True,
hut that was all done against his brother-in-law,
in the expectation (unfounded) of getting some
considerable fraction of Robb’s money. lie had
delayed the insolvency proceedings by contu-
macious behavior? True, but he (Way) would
not have visited that on the certificate; he would
have either called in a specialist to see whether
Muirhead was really right in his mind, or would
have sent him to prison till he consented to give
sensible answers to the questions put to him.
S.A.’s Methodist Chief Justice never Damns;
but as a collection of Faint Praise his latest
utterance could hardly be beaten.
“ Speaker’s Gallery ” : Concerning the
father of the N.S.W. Assembly :
The Bulletin (21/7/TO) suggests a possibility that
N.S.W. Assembly will have to “hunt for a fresh dad"
after polling day. A false alarm. Harry Levien sits
tighter to-day for Tamworth, after 30 years’ continuous
representation of the Northern Division (allowing for re-
distributions), than ever before. He has already topped
the poll 13 times. He knew one defeat—when he was
beaten by a single vote. That was when, as a boy
politician, 33 years ago, he stood for Wollombi against
Janies Augustine Cunneen (first P.M.G. under Re-
sponsible Government) and Joseph Eckford. Eck-
ford vvon. At the general election in 1880 the
candidates for Tamworth were: Levien, Sydney
Burdekin, Henley Bennett and Michael Bourke.
Levien headed Burdekin (junior member) by nine.
Levien’s subsequent colleagues were John Gill, Michael
Burke and William Springthorpe Dowell (of the melli-
fluous voice). He has never had a walk-over, but, since
Wollombi, he has always won in in a canter. In the fine
art of electioneering Harry Levien is only equalled by
Bill Lyne, who, by the way, entered the N.S.W. Assem-
bly with him. He, also, in 30 years, has not known
defeat. Touching Levien’s House-in-Macquarie-street
record, it is interesting to know that of the 103
members elected to the 10th Parliament, he alone sits
in the Assembly. The great majority have gone
over. Survivors include Francis Abigail, H. S. Badgery,
Edmund Barton, H. H. Brown, J. F. Burns, H. C. Dan-
gar, Jacob Garrard, L. F. Hevdon, John Kidd, Dan
O’Connor, C. E. Pilcher, G. H. Reid, T. M. Slattery,
Bruce Smith, Sydney Smith, T. R. Smith, F. B. Suttor
and W. J. Trickett. Death has claimed J. P. Abbott,
George W. Allen, Alexander Bowman, S. C. Brown, J. N.
Brunker, David Buchanan, Burdekin, Angus Cameron,
Edward Ooombes, Copeland, John Davies, J. S. Farnell,

The two-minute bout in the lobby of
N.S. W. Assembly, between Point-of-order Wood
Wade’s Chief Secretary) and
, Arthur Griffith, and the
shove of resentment landed
by the latter vigorous athlete
on the person of Jaclc C. L.
Fitzpatrick, recall old
troubles in and about the
same House. Paddy Crick
and Jack Haynes had a
“go” with the bare knuckles,
and John’s ascendancy won
for him his nickname,
“Samson.” Henry Cope-
land, roused to fury by an
insinuation of inebriety,
chased Holy Hindle out of
the House and into Mac-
quarie-street with loud as-
surances that he would
“screw his neck.” John
Norton landed on E. C. V-
Broughton’s eyebrow with
unceremonial suddenness-
Parkes, a Jack Johnson in
stature, shoved his fist in
the face of Patrick Jen-
ningß. John MeElhone went
for Dan O’Connor, and at
least a dozen mem hers have
spilt precious blood in sight of
the refreshment room. The chal-
lenges to “come outside” have
been too numerous to be worth men-
tioning.

The Australian Bank of Commerce.—This is
the bird that has risen from the ashes of the Australian
Joint Stock Bank. It wasn’t an early riser ; the old
A.J.S. had, in fact, been ashes for a good 17 j'ears before
the Phoenix took to the wing. But having made a start,
the A.B.C. does so with a good deal in its favor. It has a
“cleaner” balance-sheet than the management of ihe
old bank at first ventured to ask for. The original idea
was to wipe out the old paid capital arid alleged reserves,
convert some of the old deposits into shares, and lock up
the balance. The idea eventually adopted was to wipe
out not only the paid capital and fe&rves, but also one-
eighth of the old deposits and one-half the amount to be
called up from the old shareholders. Taking the figures
as at June 30,1909, this writing off would amount to the
following:—
Capital £154,570
Reserves .. .. .. 60,036
One-eighth of old deposits .. 456,259
Total £670,865
To that must be added the amount to be paid up by old
shareholders and written off—say, £190,000. The old
advances as at June, 1909, totalled £1,882,570. Thus
these old assets could be and no doubt were written
down to the extent of about 7s. 2d. in the £. The
prer'-r-'-s stood at £367,693. These apparently were not
\vrifß‘“ down at all: they stand now at £367,727. But
furth'** sums, to be paid hyoid shareholders, will be avail-
able for writing down : and this item may have some
attention.
As at June 30, 1909, the old deposits totalled
£3,750,068. One-fourth of the total of these deposits is now
represented by shares ; the balance of the capital is repre-
sented by the interest of the old shareholders in the
business. Approximately, the proportion is as follows :
Old shareholders .. .. .. .. £184,328
Old depositors .. .. .. .. 858,632
Total subscribed capital .. £1,042,960
Of the subscribed capital, in £1 shares, £958,172 is actu-
ally paid ; the balance of £84,788 is still to be got in by
instalments from the old shareholders. The authorised
capital is £2,000,000. There are tints 957,040 unallotted
shares. But until October next holders of the old
deposits have the right to exchange their deposits for
shares, so far as there is enough authorised capital to
satisfy the applications. The old deposits were disposed
of in this way
2/6 in the £ written off.
5/- ~ ~ shares.
2/6 ~ ~ 3 per cent, deposit for two years.
10/- ~ ~ inscribed deposits, 4 per cent.
It is the last two that maybe exchanged as mentioned
just now. This transaction means the swapping of a
practicallj 7 certain 3 or 4 per cent, for whatever dividend
the co. may be able to p:ij'. It will probably suit many
depositors ; and it will certainly be safer for the bank to
get rid of the liability by turning the debt into capital.
But while it will be safer for the bank, the enlargement
of the capital will of course have a steadying effect on
the rate of dividend.
The profit shown for the past half-year is
£11,670; and out of this a 3 percent, dividend is to he
paid, absorbing £8441. There is some doubt whether a
dividend should he paid. In ordinary circumstances,
some sort of a reserve should he built up first. But
the management may have reserves that they don’t
show. If they were satisfied to go ahead without writing-
off one-eighth of the deposits, then the position after the
writing-off of that half million or so should be exception-
ally strong. It is quite possible, therefore, that there
are reserves, represented by under-valuations in the
books. Further, it should suit the bank to get rid of
some of the liability previously mentioned; and the ex-
change to shares wouldn’t he likely in many cases if the
shares were not paying a dividend. On the whole, then,
if this paper were inclined to throw a brick at the A.B.C.
for paying a dividend, it would be the very softest one on
the premises.
The paid capital on June 30 was £958,172. The
liabilities were:—
Inscribed deposits .. ..£1,859,022
Special deposits (3 p.c.) .. 429,316
New deposits 1,751,994
Notes .. 79,447
Bills, etc 218,531
Total £4,338,310
Including the inscribed stock, which is not withdraw-
able, the bank has the use of £4 10s. 6d. of the public’s
money for every £1 of its own. Apart from the inscribed
stock, the bank owes the public £2,479,288, and it has no
less than £1,185,979 in cash and liquid assets. New de-
positors are therefore exceedingly well protected. The
bigness of the capital, which will prevent the rateofdivs.
from climbing to dizzy heights for many years to come,
is, on the other hand, the best guarantee that those who
drop their coin into the A.B.C. will be able to get it
when thev are entitled to it.

For the past three years profits have scarcely budged an
inch. Certainly, on the face of things, there seems to
have been a drop of £lO,OOO one term and then a re-
coverj 7 ; but that was due to the directors voting the
sum mentioned to set the Officers’ Provident Fund
on its feet. For the past six months there was no
forward movement at all; in i fact, the declared
profit was the least for 2£ years, although, the
bank should have automatically increased its aggre-
gate profits on account of having accumulated
more reserves. Nevertheless the directors pop up the
dividend 1 per cent, all round ; and that means a big
sum in a bank with so large a capital as the Victoria has
got. How this move will turn out in practice The Bul-
letin doesn’t profess to know. Theoretically it i& a
wrong step to take; for dividends should not be in-
creased on falling profits, especiallj 7 when the increased
div. absorbs very nearly 90 per cent, of the said pro-
fits. One thing may, however, be fairly said in favor of
the prisoner at the bar. The co.’s capital in proportion
to the business is unusually large, and there is conse-
quently less immediate call than there otherwise would
be for reserves. Yet the prudent investor is bound to
take into account the fact that, in order to pay the 6 per
cent., so much of the profit is absorbed that onlj 7 a paltry
£5672 is added to what is really an insurance fund for the
protection of capital. There is too big a tendencj 7 to dis-
regard the lay-by and to glue the eye only on the divi-
dend paid. Apart from everything else it is clear that
the bigger the lay-by the easier and more likely an in-
crease of dividend, and the less likely a reduction thereof.
As mentioned above, the capital is, compara-
tively speaking, very large. When the troubles hap-
pened in the early ’nineties the capital was £600,000 in
240,000 ordinary shares. This amount was added to (1)
by issuing £416,760 of pref. capital in exchange for
deposits, and (2) by calling up another £2 10s. per share.
Holders of 27,750 shares either couldn’t or wouldn’t pay
up, and thus the £79,584 of capital thej 7 had paid was
forfeited. Deposits have crept up steadily but not
rapidly; 10 years ago they were £4,646,794, and now
they are £6,014,441. The aggregate in proportion to capital
and reserves is still small. For every £1 the shareholders
have in the business the public (depositors, etc.)have £3
17s. 6d. That means comparatively small risks all round —
verj’small risksindeed for the depositors. But it also means
comparatively small profits for the shareholders. Some
big Australian banks have between £6 and £7 of deposits,
etc., for every £1 of capital and reserves; and though
that is verj 7 awkward for the shareholders when things
go wrong with the securities into which the money has
been put, it is very pleasant for them when things are
going- all right.. This is a case in which very big risks
don’t exist; wherefore the profit calculated on capital
and reserves combined has been modest: —

In the foregoing, the figures for June, 1909, are calculated
on the profits shown prior to the deduction of the £lO,OOO
passed over to the officers’ fund.
Compared with those of 12 months agro, the
principal lines in the present balance-sheet are as follow :

The bank has been letting out money prettj 7 freelj 7 , and
it is at present left with only 29 per cent, of its lia-
bilities represented by liquid assets. Under normal con-
ditions, that is not quite enough ; and with its present
resources the hank can’t safelj 7 increase its advances fur-
ther. No doubt, it hopes by putting up its dividend to
attract more deposits. Probably it will ; for in this
matter the foolish public is much more inclined to
rush along with its money to a bank which is paying
out a big dividend than to one which pays a small divi-
dend and puts by a large amount to strengthen its re-
serves, and thus guarantee the return of the depositors’
money. It, is a good deal like the folly which makes
people rush for an overerolvded tram, and hang on to it
by the skin of their teeth, when thej 7 might ride in much
more safety on the empty car that is bringing up the
rear.

“The recent coal strike entailed a loss to the co. of
over £70,000.” Nevertheless a profit of £lB,OBl is
shown. Which makes one wonder whether, if there
hadn’t been a strike, the directors would have shown a
profit of £BB,OBl. Judging bv their previous published
accounts thcv wouldn’t have done anything of the sort.
Further, though the co. only, made £lB,OBl of visible
profits for the half-j 7 ear, trie directors apparently
didn’t hesitate to pay away £62,400 in dividend.
The truth no doubt is that, if they felt that
way, the directors could generally show a great deal
more profit than they do show ; and what they don’t
show is being stuffed away into extensions of main and
plant, etc., and is regarded as’ written off to cover depre-
ciation. Doubtless it was because they had this internal
reserve that the directors didn’t hesitate to pay the big
dividend even though not one-third of it was visibly
earned. The same rate of div., by the wav, has been
paid for over 25 years ; and that the co. can go on paying
it in the face of a loss of over £70,000 through one trouble
is calculated to give shareholders a very comfortable
feeling.
Wliat amount of profit the co. does write off
ostensibly to cover depreciation it never even hints at.
Here, however, are a few comparisons. Seven years ago
the fixed investment item in the balance-sheet (buildings,
plant, land, mains, etc.) stood at £1,268,939. It now
stands at £1,243,886, or £25,053 less. Yet the “ sales of
gas, etc.,” for the past half-year were £291,734 as against
only £188,005 seven years ago. Either, therefore, the
old services supply over 55 per cent, more gas. etc., than
they did seven years ago, or a great many new ser-
vices have been provided. Anyway, there is the fact that
a plant alleged to be worth £25,053 less is supplying
over £200,000 worth more gas per annum. The most
reasonable explanation is that a great many new mains
and a great deal more plant have been movided, but
that the whole of it has been paid for out of revenue,
while £25,053 of revenue has also been written off the old
plant—in other words, has been put into stores and
liquid assets. One can’t say how well the co. has been
doing ; but it is pretty certain that the published ac-
counts err on the side of excessive modesty, and that
even if the co. did lose over £70,000, that and probably a
great deal more has been provided by the public during
the past few years, and has been stuffed away by the
directors to meet just such emergencies. In a manner
of speaking, therefore, the strike didn’t cost the co. any-
thing, since its div. wasn’t touched ; the bill was really
footed by the public.

The latest shuffle was explained six months ago. At that
time the capital was £200,000 in £1 shares. Having, how-
ever) something up their sleeve that thej 7 didn’t quite know
what to do with, the directors decided to issue another
100,000 shares, to be for the time being paid up to 10s. ;
and in case the emaciated shareholders might not know
where to turn for the 10s., the Board decided to pay 6s.
of it out of reserves. That left only 4s. per share of
new capital for the shareholders to actuallj’ supply. The
present capital is therefore £250,000, or, to be exact,
£249,965, some verj’ gradual gentleman having failed up
to June 30 to send along the odd £35. So the historj’ of
this Remarkable concern can be brought up to date this
way :
1893 Old co. in existence; capital, £40,000.
1894 Still the old co. ; capital increased to £60,000.
1899—New co. formed ; capital watered to £120,000.
1902—20,000 shares issued at par.
1906 20,000 free shares issued.
1907 40,000 shares issued at par.
1909 Authorised capital increased from £200,000 to
£400,000, to allow of more watering.
1910— 100,000 new shares issued; 6s. per share paid on
them as a bonus.
So, of the present capital of £250,000, only £140,000 has
been put up by shareholders, even counting the old co.’s
£60,000 as having been all actually paid by them, and
the 10 per cent. (£25,000 a year) is really 18 per cent.
After the recent watering transaction the re-
serves look wretchedly small. But the Sydney Ferries
don’t necessarily wear their ace of hearts on their sleeve ;
thej’ probably keep a good card or two inside it. Thus
“ship property” is valued in the books at £85,386 —
£85,386 for a mere matter of 27 passenger steamers, five
horse-ferries, and three cargo boats. It looks painfullj’
modest. In June, 1903, the capital was £140,000. Since
then £60,000 of capital has been got in ; and with that
£60,000 of capital plus profits, the co. has in seven years
added the Kulgoa, Kareela, Kaikai, Kailoa, Kirrule
(building), and a few other trifles ; has added £55.000
of landed propertj’; has put £6OOO into wharves, etc.
(probably more, but that is the added book value); and
has turned £7lBO of cash into £45,041 of cash and Gov-
ernment debentures. And, meantime, it has been
steadily paying out the 10 per cent. div. Exactly how well
the co. has done it would be impossible for the outsider
to say. The table at the head of these remarks probably
doesn't get near the truth because of the huge sums of
profit written off and never shown, allegedly to cover
depreciation. The foregoing hint as to the extent of
seven years’ hoarding gives the only suggestion possible
as to the real position.
Yet there are insects even in this ointment,
especially for the person who buys at present and pays a
price which sometimes doesn’t yield 3 per cent. If the
future were going to be anything like .he past, the stock
might be dirt cheap even if, to begin with, it only yielded
2 per cent. But things may wilt as well as grow. The
investor may not approve of Socialism anj r more than he
does of gout; but he is liable to both, just the same.
And there are hundreds of thousands calling themselves
Anti-Socialists who can’t stand the idea of the link
between the State railwaj’and tram sj’stemson the north
and south being in private, profit-grabbing hands. Of
course, the State isn’t at all likelj’to take without pay-
ing ; but, even though it pays full value for everything
tangible that it takes, it isn’t likely to pay for intangible
goodwill. The book value of the assets (less liabilities
and current dividend) is £266,552. The market value of
the stock is about £690,000. So the investor is paying at
the rate of £424,000 for something that is not in the
balance-sheet—either goodwill or something else. If the
State or the municipality doesn’t step in, he will no
doubt get his money back in time, with interest. If it
does step in—well, that’s where the gamble arrives.

This co. is getting pretty close to the end of its tether.
Twentj' years ago the N.S.W. Parliament gave it 28
years, suit, has only the odd eight left. The capital used
to he £200,000 ; but. as the table on top of these remarks
shows, the shareholders have already had £150,000 re-
turned. Yet. though the capital stands now at
£50,000, or ss. per share, the market values
the stock at the same old £1 or thereabouts.
At the end of eight years the whole undertaking
has to be passed over to the State. Besides cash and in-
vestments there will be a few assets which won’t have to
be handed over. Value these at £lO,OOO, and add
£54,194, the net value of the liquid assets, and there is
thus £64,194 available for the shareholders. To eventu-
ally return them the £1 per share at which the market
values the stock, about £136,000 will thus have to be gath-
ered in during the next eight j’ears—an average of
£17,000 a j'ear, in addition to the dividend, which
at the present rate is equal to 74 per cent, on £l.
In the latter years of the co.’s life its profits will also
most likely be seriously affected by the State water
supply which the Works Committee has agreed to recom-
mend. Meantime, however, the co. is quite capable of
putting up its price to the limit, as it did three or four
years ago when opposition seriously threatened, on the
plea that in the interests of shareholders it was compelled
to make hay before its sun was eclipsed. And, further,
of course, the earning of the necessary £17,000 a year
will be a much easier matter a few j r ears hence on ac-
count of the big interest receipts there will be by that
time. It is a scandalous tiling that any town should
have to pay so much for its water that the co.’s shares
should be quoted at 400 per cent, premium ; yet, though
there is a lot of the gamble about it, it is highly probable
that the gamblers who pay even that price will get their
money back and very good interest as well.

A southern trustee office has a northern branch ; but
the concern on the table is the only purelj' Queensland
trustee co., and with so big a field it ought to have a
rosy future, provided it doesn’t lose its head and rush up
its dividends. It isn’t only that a man wants to see a
co. possessed of good reserves before he makes
it his trustee and executor ; good reserves also generally
mean cautious management, and he naturally wants
his estate cautiously managed after he is dead and when
he can no longer retrieve mistakes. So far, Queensland
has no reason to complain of its trustee co. It got into
a difficult position, certainly’, after Queensland’s great
boom collapsed ; but it pulled itself through very well,
and the reserve additions during the past 10 years have
been at any rate reasonable. Further, the assets don’t
now appear to be of the very shrinkable variety ; the
only line about which there could be much doubt is—
“ Secured loans, investments, and sundTy debtors,
£7385.” The balance of the capital and reserves is practi-
cally all in public securities. The co. appears to deserve
its State’s confidence, and it is evidenrlj’ getting its
deserts ; for the trust estates in hand have increased
from £1,528,345 in 1908 to £2,135,244 in 1910, and that
ought to mean more profits, more reserves, still more
confidence, and still more business. Calculated on
capital and reserves combined, profits are only moderate
as trustee cos.’ profits go ; last year they amounted to
£8 12s. 4d. .percent. But a high rate of profits isn’t
what testators want in a trustee co. In fact, a high rate
of profit may result from excessive charges, or from small
capital in proportion to the trusts in hand ; and those
are certainly not features that should strike the testator
favorably when he is looking for a trustee.

“Owing to the high price of ingredients which ruled
during the greater portion of the half-year, the profits
have been adversely affected,” the directors report.
Curiously, however, the managing director of another
hotel and catering concern, the Hotel Metropole, told his
shareholders the other day that profits were a bit better
because prices had favored them. Whatever the
explanation, the profit figures of Sargents, Ltd.,
are moving down in a way that ought to
make various people restless: £6865, £6433, and
£6038 isn’t the right kind of progress, especially in
view of the large increase of capital, which ought to
mean more and not less profit. The view this paper put
forward at the outset was that the co. w'as over-capital-
ised, and that the business was asked to carry far too much
“paper” in the shape of goodwill. Not one penny has
yet been written off that item, which still stands at the
original £45,000; j 7 et, judging by the decrease of profits,
goodwill isn’t worth what it was 18 months ago. It is
quite true that the bun-shop business show’s huge profits
occasionally. Lyons’s, in London, lately reported over a
million sterling profit for the year—a fact which was
carefully passed on to Australian investors and specula-
tors. But the sudden and tremendous success of Lyons’s
proves how erratic a thing this bun-shop business is,
and how uncertain a thing bun-shop goodwill is; for
while Lyons’s has gone up like a rocket, others, whose
lunches'were in everybody’s mouth a few years ago, have
come down like a stick. It is too early jet to say
whether Sargents is going to be the rocket or the stick ;
but the profits certainly are not so far behaving as a
self-respecting rocket should.

This disappearance of £9OOO is a sudden and comprehen-
sive event, but the wear and tear of theatrical property
is enormous, and the co. undoubtedly did the right
thing. The only question is whether it wouldn’t have
been wiser to write off depreciation each half-year
instead of making a paper accumulation. This is how
the money went

The leasehold has still 61 years to run, so the writing-off

liberal. The electric light plant and asbestos curtain are
wholly, and the furnishings mostly, written off. These
are eminently perishable goods. Apart from a doubt as
to whether sufficient provision is made for freehold
buildings, the writing-down seenis liberal.
One gratifiying feature is that the big overdraft
which was incurred when the great renovation was made
in 1903 is now nearly gone to its long home. It has faded
by degrees as follows :

Seeing’ that this ghost is so nearly shovelled off the
premises, the directors probably contemplate a small in-
crease of dividend at an early date —possibly a year
hence. That may be the reason why they selected the
present time for a big writing-off. They may have decided
to kill two spectres with one stone.

The dividend has been put up to 8 per cent. ; the other
1 per cent, is added as a bonus—which may mean that
the directors don’t commit themselves to 9 per cent, as
a regular thing. The co. has been going for over 30
years, and the div., which had got down to 5 per cent.,
has been creeping slowly upwards for 20 years. The co.
is a conservatively-managed concern ; and, though its
profits will dodge about with the seasons, and be good
when they are good and slump when they are bad, the
co. has now a lot in hand, and is much better able to
stand a knock than ever it was.

These figures (reserves included) are as at the date of the
balanceln each case, and before distribution of the divi-
dend. In 10 years £22,103 has been added to the reserves,
and if that money earns 7 per cent, it is enough to pay
2 per cent, on the capital. In other words, other things
being equal, the co. can as easily pay 12 per cent, now as
it could pay 10 per cent. 10 years ago, assuming that its
money earns,7 per cent. Still, the additions to reserves
have been small lately ; and, unless the co. has been
doing a great deal of internal writing down, it will
have to show better results to justify the dividend
it is paying at present. Probably it knows that, and for
that reason brands 2£ per cent, of the dividend as
“bonus.”

Holders of copper scrip felt a shade better last
week on cable news that American producers were going
to knock 12£ per cent, off their output, which means
about 7 per cent, off the output of the world. Copper
went just past £llO in 1907, and has been creeping down
ever since, until now it is at about £55, or exactly half of
the top price ; and the cost of production hasn’t eased
at all. The distressing foundation fact is that between
1902 and 1908 the production of the metal moved
up from 541,100 tons to 734,545 tons, and is still
moving up. It is true that many old mines,
which were reworked a few years ago, have fallen
idle again ; but there are many other mines, like those at
Cloncurry, which were opened at that time and have still
to turn out their blocks of rich surface ore. To reduce
the output of American mines by 124 per cent, may stop
the fall; but on the statistics—which admittedly' are
tricky things to stand on—it doesn’t look as if it could
send the price up very far. For it has to be remembered
that the present is only a poor price compared with the
high prices of the 1906-7 boom years : before that mining
engineers had for a long while mostly figured on copper
at £56.

A serious tone prevails in Broken Hill mining
circles to-day. But there is one source of joy ; and that
is the Murex process plant, which has been erected with
great solemnity on the bottom floor of the Block 14 mill.
In London, where directors see things “as through a
glass, darkly,” there is said to be a belief that the
process is revolutionising ore concentration in Broken
Hill, and that fat dividends are going to be paid out of
the results of the treatment of 1000 tons of Block 14 sul-
phides. Locally a different view is taken. Months haX e
elapsed since the unit was erected—it is only a pocket
plant, anyhow—and nobody seems to know w'hether the
machine is refining fat for the manufacture of candles or
is simply mixing oil for the lubrication of Block 14
machinery. It is about time, anyhow, that the practical
results of some of the ore-dressing work were made
known.

Theß. H. Junction has shut down, ostensibly
for a few weeks, to allow of certain repairs to the shaft
and alterations to the mill. The latter include the in-
stallation of three more grinding pans. This work can
be completed in three weeks ; bht what then ? There is
a little financial bother, and this is going to take more
than three weeks to settle up. Shareholders will be
lucky if they see the mine working again within three
months.

At the B. Hi South Extended good progress is
being made with the east crosscut, which is to prove the
mine another Broken Hill Prop. The same thing has
been said about a dozen abandoned “shows” around
Broken Hill, and it will go on being, said about many
more as long as there is any smoke coming out of Broken
Hill chimney-stacks. The “ South Extended lode ’’—-that
is, the big lode, of which nobody knows anything at pre-
sent—should be cut very shortly. If it is proved that it
really does exist, there will be a flutter along the White
Leads country that stretches out towards the Pinnacles.

Main Ridge (N.S.W.) has had itrfirst crushing
of wash, and has cleaned up 790 z. from 203 tons. This
supports engineer Nardin’s estimate of 7dwt. ; it works
out, in fact, at 7dwt. 18gr. Also, the very small loss of
7gr. in the tailings is satisfactory. Now, therefore, it is
a matter of costs—and not so much 'treatjfient dosts
either as mining costs, which are still the ipost doubtful
feature of the business. /

J. C. Watson, P. W. Tewksbury and R. C.
Dixson have done just the sort of thing that might have
been expected of them. People bought shares in the
Mynpachts Dredging Co., not because they knew any-
thing about the concern, but because they knew a good
deal about the men behind it. The plaims, on which
J. C. Watson sweated off a couple of stone weight in
S’Africa, didn’t come up to expectations ; and the direc-
tors decided to pull out before the co.’s money was gone.
Then, having a dredge on hand, they looked round for a
place to put it; and Tewksbury assigned an option he
had over half of the leases of the Afaluen Red bank
Co. Then, further, so that the people who had
bought contributing shares and shares at a premium in
the Mynpachts might lose as little as possible, the three
decided to transfer to them a block of their own shares,
equivalent in face value to the amount contributed. That
done, everybody—promoters and contributors—will be
on exactly the same footing. The new co. will be called
the Victorian-Araluen Co., in 30,000 shares, 10,000 of
which will go to the Redbank Co., and the balance will
be available for shareholders in the Mynpachts Co. The
Redbank Co. paid £5600 in divs. in the past 12 months ;
and there is no apparent reason why the new co., with
its powerful dredge, shouldn’t do quite as well.

Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) has resumed ore-
treatment ; but as the solutions will probably absorb
over IOOOoz. to start with, the first month’s return from
the reorganised mill isn’t likely to boom the shares. The
new plant is officially described as interesting from a
technical point of view, for the reason that Krupp have
been substituted for Griffin mills, and tube mills added
in preference to extra grinding pans. It has a bigger
crushing capacity than the old one ; but as the roasting
furnaces can’t make a good job of more than 20,000 tons
a month, it is improbable that any attempt will be made
to handle more than this quantity.
Retiring superintendent Doolette estimates the
actual ore reserves in Boulder No. 1 Co.’sSt. George mine
(W.A.) at 16,000 tons, worth 7Jdwt. In backing up this
estimate, general-manager Hamilton says it is conserva-
tive, and adds that the payable ore occurs so irregularly
in the very wide lode channel that a lot of prospecting
work is needed to find it. He opines, however, that all
the pay stuff has not yet been found in the levels already
opened up, and that further development will reveal it.
As regards the co.’s Kalgoorlie lease, the chairman
mentioned at the recent annual meeting 1 that this pro-
perty would get the whole of the underlay of the feouth
Kalgurli’s western lode at 1500 ft., and that later on some
working arrangement for dealing with the ore would
probably be made with the latter concern.

Oroya Links (W.A.) is beginning to find its
level. The Oroya-Brown Hill section of tne property is
about depleted ; atid as the Central Boulder block is in a
similar plight, the co. will have to shortly fall back on
the Golden Links for sole support. Unfortunately the
latter is not developed to stand the strain of furnishing
the present output of 11,000 tons a month, so a drop in
the tonnage is inevitable, and the probability of the grade
coming down on top of this has caused a lot of nervous
holders to get out.
* * , * *
The apparently hopeless task of making the old
General Gordon (W.A.) pay still keeps the Sirdar Co.’s
nose to the grindstone. For the half-year to the end of
Jane, 5810 tons were raised and treated for £4892; and,
by the co.’s own system of accountancy, a net profit of
£490 is shown. But, with all outgoings charged up, this
surplus is turned into a deficiency of £454. The cash
balance on June 30 amounted to £173 ; but, as the co.
owed £BlO to sundry creditors and hasn’t paid off any-
thing since, its financial position is, for a small concern,
decidedly “ rocky.” Both directors and manager look
forward to a “ profitable return ” from the current half-
year’s operations, and the shareholders are entitled to get
all the comfort they can out of that statement.
* * * *
With its customary backwardness, Peak Hill
(W.A.) has just issued its report for the year ended
June, 1909. This shows that the co. had got still deeper
in debt; and as things have since gone from bad to
worse, time is again asked to pay interest on the prior
lien bonds and first mortgage debenture stock. The
mine is. done; and further work simply means further-
waste.
* * * *
Preparations are being made to tap holders of
Gwalia Consolidateds for more money. The failure of
this co. to make a do of things, in spite of enormous ex-
penditure and favorable reports by mining experts and
others, has been frequently alluded to on this page; so
further reference to the worn-out subject is superfluous.
Perhaps some day the show will be made to pay ; but no
one in the West expects to see the co. get back what it
and its predecessors put into the mine and its patchwork
equipment.
* * * *
The old Santa Claus at Randells (W.A.) is to
be looked at by Hans Irvine with a view to forming a co.
to work it. This mine has been tackled off and on for
some years past, but up to the time the last co. gave up
the struggle it had cost considerably more to get the gold
than the stuff was worth. It would take at least £20,000
to prove and properly equip the property; and in view of
that fact, coupled with past failures, the experts will no
doubt look very earnestly at the property before recom-
mending it.
* * * *
Hampden, Cloncurry (Q.), reports that the rise
680 ft. north of No. 2 shaft has holed through to the level
above. Assays have been running 10 per cent, copper
over a width of 3£ft. Another rise 910 ft. north of the
shaft is up 60ft., and prospects 6£ per cent, over a width
of less than 2ft. At the Duchess mine, the north drive
continues to carry low-grade ore (about 1 per cent,
copper), but the rise started 220 ft. north of the shaft is
showing some good prospects. The rise at 21ft. showed
bornite and copper pyrites, and assayed 19J per cent,
over a width of 3ft. The latest telegram states that these
rich assays continue to 30ft. above the rise. Nearly
everywhere the rich stuff in both mines is narrow ; they
contain a great deal of very low-grade ore, with a con-
centration of copper in a comparatively small area. And
Hampden, it has to be remembered, is a quarter-million
co.

New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers,
crushed 1046 tons for £3494, making £7173 in four weeks.
But some people think they can see the end of these
good crushings, for the market is weak, partly in conse-
quence of the drop in the value of the stone treated and
partly because the bottom levels do not look too bright.
Still the reef is over 1000 ft. long in N.B.F. ground, so there
is plenty of scope for developments at depth. Quality
varies from £l4 to as many shillings, which makes it
hard to value reserves.

New Einasleigh (North Queensland) is sup-
posed to have 141,500 tons of reserves, half of them
valued at 8 per cent. New financial arrangements in-
clude an advance of £30,000 to help to pay for
plant and equipment. An option has also been given
over a block of 67,500 shares; but the right to call on
these shares at par is not likely to be exercised unless
the market shows better form. All that can be said
definitely is that recent development's have increased the
reserves, and that the co. is paying its way with its ship-
ments of 7 per cent. ore.
* * * *
For the last four weeks Chillagoe (Q.) did its
best for this year ; 5990 tons ore gave blister and bullion
containing 249 tons copper, 342 tons lead, 50,5060 z. silver
and 13780 z. gold. The co. is now tapping the Etheridge
regularly, but it isn’t to have things all its own way, for
the Sulphide Corporation is on the field as a buyer of
concentrates. The Chillagoe railway returns now include
the traffic over the Etheridge extension, so there are
more costs to set against last month’s good-looking rail-
way revenue ; and the debenture interest has also in-
creased for the same reason.
* * * *
Costs at the Birthday Tunnel, Berringa (Vic.),
got down last half-year to Bs. 2d. a ton, made up of
mining 4s. Ujd., haulage Is. 7d., and crushing Is. 7jd.
This is less than 2dwt. ; and seeing that 11,672 tons were
treated, and mining was done down to 700 ft., it is a bit,
of a record. The fire in December 'stopped work till
March, when stoping- was resumed. The 1 only spot that
looked well was in the north end, but the poverty even
there can be judged from the fact hereinbefore hinted at
that 11,672 tons only yielded £5778 worth of gold—practi-
cally 10s. per ton. Though the paid-up capital was only
£12,500, altogether £231,520 of gold has been got out of
the mine, and £66,000 has been paid in divs. Revenue
has, however, been drawn upoti almost to the last shilling
to disburse profits, and now the co. is in debt £2300 and
needs many things. Well, that is the way of most Vic-
torian cos. None the less, the Rake’s Progress is not fair
to the manager or to the industry. If 10 per cent, had
been cut out of profits for a reserve, £6600 would
have been to the credit of the fund, and scrip
would not have run down just because some
worn-out machinery had been blotted out by a
fire. Imagine what will happen if the crosscuts now
being put, out 200 ft. below the No. 8 level hit poor stuff
right off in the Tunnel and the Kangaroo lod s. It would
be quite in keeping with the history of Berringa if this
happened, and yet the only provision for a trouble of the
kind is a bundle of debts.
* * * *
The manager of the South German, Maldon
(Vic.), is heard piping : “ Please give me a new battery."
In return, the shareholders pipe : “ Please give us a
decent reserve of stone first.” There is justice in both
demands, but Maldon folk don’t like paying Ihe needful
calls. They won’t see that if they want stone opened up
and crushed cheaply they must put up cash for dead
work and plant. A diamond drill scheme is on the
tapis for the South German, to find out what has be-
come of the shoot of gold that cut out on the bound-
ary of the Deep lease, as well as to do prospect-
ing at other levels. Minister Mcßride ought to spare
a plant from the Powlett now that he has. got things
in full swing there. A strike at Maldon would open up a
lot of pockets for calls that have been closed to Castle-
maine, Bendig-o and Ballarat. Finances cannot improve,
though, until shareholders give the South German
managet a chance to deal with low-grade ore. That
means recognising that the mine is a poor proposition
and that bulk must be handled.
* * * *
Porepunkah (Vic.), which added itself to the
list of Bright’s dividend-paying dredges just under 12
months ago, handed out another £5OO during the past
half-year. Still the profits didn’t move the right way :
June, 190$ .. £lOO6
Dec., 1908 .. 1337
June,. 1909 .. 921
Dec., 1909 .. £ll4l
June, 1910 .. 517
A Bright dredge cannot, however, do much picking and
choosing—it has to go right ahead. And as very few of
the cos. have done any prospecting at all, they have only
a vague idea of what is ahead. On June 30 the co. had
£463 in hand and owed on all accounts (mostly for the
land) £1935.
* * * *
Bendigo’s lately-eclipsed New Moon had a more
cheerful tale to tell at the half yearly meeting at Eagle-
hawk the other day. But the cheerfulness was all in the
current output; the deep levels have been duffers. A
few hundred tons were torn out of the 1345 ft. level; but
below that it is “ poor quartz ” or “stone pinched out "
—the last being the record of the 2125 ft. drive. §o the
co. is back in the old stopes, rooting for ore ther,e and
finding more than it expected. For the six months
ss. 6d. a share was paid as against 2s. for the whole of
1909. But when a co. has to come up from the bottom
and glean in the upper levels, it is a pretty glum look-out,

If Senator Clemons is satisfied with the form in
which the accounts of the Tasmanian Copper Co. are
sent out to Australian shareholders, it is a pity he ever
got the control of the office shifted from London to
Launceston. If he is satisfied with the result of the past
year's work, or with the general outlook in respect to
the process introduced at Rosebery (Tas.) by lawyer
Thyrine, of Queensland, then doubly is it a pity. A loss
of £5168 sums up 1909. Lately, it seems, Thynne has
done with the process co., so Horwood may yet
get his foot in with his process. There ought
to be something in the mine. It has 250,000 tons
proved, and it has been sending ore averaging oTsoz.
gold, 13'450z. silver, 9TI per cent, lead and 30 per cent,
zinc per ton to the smelter. This is not the poorest ore
in the mine by a long way ; but, with anything like the
recovery and the costs claimed by Horwood, even lower-
grade stuff would give a profit. Everything depends to-
day on the way the Londoners, who are supposed to be
putting up the money for the Extraction Co.’s bi-sulphite
process, like the outlook now that Thynne has gone out.
Much of the dead work has been done, so it would be a
pity if they should cry enough when the world wants to
see if their promises are of the piemrust order.

Mfc. Bischoff (Tas.) is a fine example of a mine,
supposed to be worked out, resurrected by modern
management with the aid of a favorable metal market.
So far from keeping its mind fixed upon the graveyard,
as it used to do a few years ago, the co. has burst out into
new equipment, to which 10 stamps have just been added,
while an aerial tram service is to follow. In the past six
months £25,760 of profit was made ; £lB,OOO w'as divided,
£4585 written off, and £3175 added to reserves.

Tongkah Harbor having dodged round an
awkward corner, the Age, with sweet veracity, calls out
that shareholders are eating- their tongues out with im-
patience to get David Currie’s report on the co.’s claim.
Melbourne hasn’t got half a dozen decent-sized holders
of Tongkahs. Hobart and Sydney nurse that baby.
What shareholders in those places want to know
most is how long after the experts got en-
throned at Tongkah was the first condemnatory
wire sent by any one of the party to Collins-
street. Further, was such wire handed on instanter
to the Board? Most people had forgotten that Currie
ever wrote a report. Even if they recalled the fact they
knew that he could not break fresh ground after the story
of J. L. Wharton, his colleague, had been printed. So
no matter what the Age may say or the Leader may tip,
no one is worrying much about Currie’s report, except
the man who is short of scrip and who doesn’t like the
prospect of the new dredges being landed at Tongkah
before he can cover up. What the Board ought to do is
to get a report from Boyd, the co.’s old second in com-
mand, who, having worked the ground, and more or less
bored the harbor, can tell from hard experience whether
occasional boring is trustworthy, and whether he thinks
the show the “goner ” that the visitors assumed.
Waihi Grand Junction (M.L.) cables the news
to J. Bull, who owns most of it, that a make of quartz
50ft. wide is showing in the crosscut from No. 5 level
(698 ft.). The Royal reef has been a consistent producer,
but has never shown such a great width before. It is
the Martha that has been mainly responsible for the out-
put from Waihi for so many years. But forcing the pace
and the payment of large dividends carried Waihi shares
up to a high price, arid at the first sign of poverty in the
deep levels there was a bad slump. This development in
the Royal reef may' shake up the market again, because
the Waihi. has been contemplating a crosscut near the
Grand Junction’s boundary.

The N.S.W. mining law is a tangle full of
knots, but barrister R. E. Kemp has straightened it out
in “ The Law of Mines and Minerals,” published by the
Law Book Co. All the Acts are printed, with notes,
decided cases, and a valuable index.
J.K.W. : The outlook for the mere assayer is
wretched ; scores are working as miners and truckers.
Keep off it... F.M.'B. : Mount Morgan, to May, 1909,
£13,172,175 ; Waihi, to December, 1909, £8,180,218.

S. Aus. has a wild hope that it has—somewhere,
in parts unknown—-a gold mine at last. The perversity
of Providence in placing all the payable gold shows out-
side its border's in every direction has long worried the
Ceil i ral State, so it was ready to have its leg pulled when
a half-caste with the suggestive name of Joe Miller pro-
duced a nice 20oz. nugget, and told his story of a Magic
Cave. This was at Denial Bay, a port far out west, and
the cave is placed about 460 miles up country. “ Pendent
from the roof was a mass of gold like a bunch of grapes,
which could be rocked to and fro with the band, but
could not be dislodged. The natives regarded it as sacred,
arid worshipped it. No lubra was allowed to approach
within half a mile of the cave on pain of death.” It
sounds as if J. Miller had been to see the “Aladdin”
pantomime; or he may have been reading a 20-vear-old
novel, The Wings of Silence,” by’ a local writer, George
Cossins. Anyway, the grape-bunch nugget legend is
common among the natives, and various parties are going
out per camel to give S.A.’s craving for a real goldfield
one more chance.

Some mining cos. are whales on decimals.
Mungana (Queensland) frequently carries its calcu-

After some pretty hard fighting, Wallaroo
Phosphate Co. (S. Aus.) announces a dividend of 6 per
cent. This co., which works on friendly terms with the
big Wallaroo Copper Co., has put up a sulphuric acid
plant capable of producing 10,000 tons a year, and it,
together with the plant operated by the Wallaroo Copper
Co., gives a total supply of 15,000 tons. Besides some local
product, the Phosphate Co. is importing shiploads of
pyrites from Spain, where the stuff can be bought for about
£1 per ton. There is plenty of dense pyritic ore in Aus-
tralia just as good for acid manufacture as the Spanish,
but the cost of transport blocks it. The acid is used
mainly’to make super-phosphate and other fertilisers, a
business which is growing big in Victoria and South Aus.

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in trans-
mission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings
save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent, of oil, so one of
the first duties is naturally for engineers to direct their
special attention to these bearings and to car boxes for
trucks. Hyatts are in continuous use in Cement Works,
Ore Dressing Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bush-
ings of flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, they can apply' to the Australian Agents, W. &
J. Lempriere, Melbourne; or E. W. llursthouse & Co.,
of Wellington, the Agents in New Zealand.*

ROBUR
It’s all nonsense for anybody
to say that the public don’t
know when tea is good value or
when it isn’t —you’ve only got
to note how Robur has “ caught
on” to be convinced on that
point —the customers say they
like it because it has a distinct
flavour —but the truth is they
prefer it because it is good value
—to my mind no tea in the
place shows better value for the
money. And that’s why there’s
more of it sold than all the
others put together.
I’ve had a lot of experience
and I’ve tried hundreds of times
to get my customers to take
other teas —and even now, when
a new tea comes along, 1 get
a little of it and push it out
with the hope that some of my
customers will like it and use it
instead of Robur because
theres’s so little profit on Robur
—but they don’t seem to stick
to new brands for longpr
they always go back to Robur,
and l don’t blame ’em.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 2, 1910.
My Dear Arini,—
The Governor of Victoria and Lady Carmichael
came over the border on Thursday last, and are
now staying at Federal Government House. A
Melbourne woman who travelled on the same
train lias been telling me things about Lady Car-
michael, and declares that she is one of the most
level-headed vice-regal women ever imported
here. Her “ Lady Carmichael Guild ” is a
society of the highest practical usefulness ; also it
is run on thoroughly business lines. Having
for its head a Scotswoman it naturally would
be. _ Its aim is to put home industries on a paying
basis, and it takes the little industries, one at a
time, and puts them on the basis firmly and
gently, while the other industries wait on the
mat until their turn comes. It was found, for
instance, that several thousands of pounds’ worth
of Irish crochet lace are annually imported into
Victoria, which money might be spent in the State
if the lace were made on the premises. Women
are making more indifferent crochet lace all
over Australia than any other thread tangle-
ment that was ever taken up as a means
of slaying time. A visit to any up-country
show proves that the will to make lace is
here, also the energy to evolve miles of it,
also the ignorance of how to do it well. The
Guild claims to teach the art and also to place the
work when it is worth placing. The Arts and
Crafts Guild works with the League, and they
have got into touch with the trade. Consequently
the local lace industry is beginning to get on that
paying basis aforementioned. Until that is done,
no other industry need put its head round the
door and ask, “Is it my turn now?” Mrs.
Clapp, Mrs. McDevitt, Miss Mary Chomley and
Mrs. Shields are helping the work along.
Another Government House guest just now is
Governor Harry Barron, of Tasmania. He is
one of the new school of working State Governors,
as distinguished from the old ornamental or hen-
raising school of which the bygone Augustus
Loftus was a specimen—Governors who try hard
to make it appear as if the figurehead were in
reality part of the engine of the ship of State.
His Ex. is game to open more sheep-dog trials in
a given time than any other viceroy of his weight
and proportionate salary throughout the Com-
monwealth. As for church fairs, he revels in
them. He has come solus, leaving behind him his
Missus, who is the despair of overworked A’s.D.C.
because she will do unconventional things.
Mount Kosciusko is the happy hunting-ground
of good fashionables in these winter days. Some
of the carnivallers who took part in the fancy
costume ball and other jinks have returned to
town, and they tell of gay doings among the
snows, and report that Nature’s refrigerating
plant is in good order. Everything that could
freeze was “ friz ” hard the night of the ball, and
among the attractions were fireworks on the
ice. Pretty little Lady Morvyth Ward,
with a governess, is sampling our local
Switzerland just now. She is a fetching
youthful skateress in white serge, jaunty cap and
woolly “ sports ” coat. All the women are wearing
those long tight-knitted coats, from neck to
ankle. They look like a stocking stretched over
a carpet broom. So a man told me, and on that
unreliable authority I pass on the fashion note.
The men’s ski-ing club has a uniform of white
sweater, and knickers, with red cap and facings.
The hotel is very full of guests, and bookings are
already made for next winter by reckless persons,
who may be sampling a very different climate
when the date falls due. A lover of things on
ice is purser Williamson, of the Mongolia, and he
has passed a word of wonderment on the clever-
ness of the authorities who cater on such lavish
lines in the midst of a wilderness. As an expert,
his approval is worth having.
There are plenty of pretty girls to play about
with, and this abundance of girl makes Kosciusko
life attractive this season. The belle is, by almost
unanimous vote, Miss Beetham, a gilded maiden
from Maoriland, who is under the wing of Mrs.
Bidwell. Then there are Miss Eileen Maiden,
who is a leading skateress; and Misses Bell, Irene
Lees and two Knoxes. Other visitors include
Mrs. and Miss Burdekin, Mrs. Alec Hay, Dr.
Graham Bell and Mrs. Bell, Mr. and Mrs.
Neville Dangar, some O’Donnells of Min-
gay (well-known squatting folk), the Hud-
sons of Burwood, the Wunderlichs, Dr. and
Mrs. Cooley, the Playfairs, Phizackerleys and
McCathies. From these names you may judge that
no Sydney guest could feel lonesome at the Polish
mountain. You are bound to meet somebody you
know. One of the best catches in Australia is
there to give the girls a treat —“ Gam ” Walker,
who generally lives with his relatives, the Dr.
Lamrocks, of Kogarah. He is not yet 21, and he
will have an unwieldy income when he comes of
age (from Walker’s whisky, and he is the only
one in it). Ocher men are Dr. Paul and Dr.
Schlink. These two belong to the ski club, and
are regular visitants.
“ Cam ” Walker, who has been spending a short
time at Kosciusko, as above alleged, is leaving on
Saturday, per Otranto, for the land where his
money comes from. Some of his fellow students
(medicals) gave him a farewell dinner at Paris
House on Saturday night.
The great social test nowadays is at Bose Bay
Links. The Golf Club House is on the hill which
climbers are for ever striving to mount, both
literally and the other way. It requires some
nerve to walk up the long path to the pavilion
when hundreds of coldly critical society starers
are gazing stonily at the intruder. To give a golf
tea is now the summit of social desire. Mrs.
H. G. Greene gave a tea last week, which prodded
the family into the halls of fashion for keeps, and
shut the door behind them with a loud, firm clang
on the outer world of nobodies. The Greenes are
“new” people, dating from the season before
last. They live at Dunara, the big house among
many other large abodes in Wolseley-road.
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Cooper gave a reception
on Wednesday evening at the Australia behind
the grille, which the manager of that hostelry
always erects on the winter-garden balcony when
revels are held upon which the profane vulgar
may not gaze. At the Cooper reception the grille
looked like a bower of roses by Bendemeer’s
stream. All Sydney was bidden—that is, all
Sydney that counts. The remaining half-million or
so don’t count—they merely exist. Some of
the existers—and a tidy few at that—pay
rent to the Coopers for the privilege of
existing on Cooper land, for the family owns
so much of the earth around “our” (note the
irony of the quotes) harbor, that the place might
just as well be called Port Cooper for short.
Arthur Cooper, when he’s at his own domicile,
lives in England, where he married a wife. His
mother was a Miss Hill, of Sydney, and sister of
Mrs. Macnamara, that well-known and popular
society matron, the mother of handsome twin
daughters who were married simultaneously.
Either housekeeping is a surprising business in
Canada or else a lady who recently wrote me from
there is an astonishing Sapphira. She was going
to give a party. The previous night it froze to
some small extent, and she was awakened by
little tinkling sounds, like those that Matthias
heard in “The Bells.” As it was the depth of
winter she did not go down to investigate.
In the morning the mystery was explained. Be-
fore every shelf in the pantry were neat little
piles of powdered glass that had once been bottles.
Champagne, whisky and all the other drinks
stood up frozen in bottle form, and had to be
broken with a hammer. It seemed rather a good
story to me.
The coming season is likely to bring much joy
to the hearts of dry cleaners, also much grief to
women who don’t want to spend too much on the
rather expensive practice of having gowns
cleaned by a dry blow instead of in the family
wash tub. Foulard and crepon are already de-
cided upon as the leading materials for spring and
summer frocks, and this means less washing but
not less cleaning. The lingerie gowns of last
summer were as easy to get up as the nighties
which they so much resembled. Crepon and
foulard crumple just as easily and look just as
touzled after a day’s wear as the muslin and
linen confections, but the home laundry is not
for them. Only the woman who doesn’t worry
about paying her bills is feeling happy at this
change of fashion.
Weekly meetings are held to push forward the
Lorna Pounds benefit, which will come off some
time early in September. Joseph Carruthers was
bagged by the committee last week, and he pro-
mises to help as much as he can. Also other in-
fluentials were “among those present.” Mrs.
Shaw, of Ashfield, gave a function at which Lorna
and her sister shone, and it is expected that so
many friends as the fortunate Lorna possesses
will not fail to roll up at the right time. Mrs.
Shaw is the woman who went on a pa sear in
Japan a year or so back with her daughters, and
lectured pleasingly on the subject of Nippon at
several women’s clubs on her return.
The returned “ Akenehi ” has many wonderful
stories to tell of wanderings in the moist and
spicy lands to the north of us. In Port Moresby
she met with Mrs. Lett, whom Sydney folk will
know better as Florence Everett, a girl who worked
hard with the pen and at the piano. Eventually
she turned press agent for Maskelyne and Devant,
and left these parts for England, home and a hus-
band just in time to see the Messina earthquake,
which she described for one of our papers. Then
she was married to her Mr. Lett, who is in the
rubber business, and they now live in one room
at Port Moresby. Houses are very scarce there,
it seems, and have to be let in single-room flats.
Mr. and Mrs. Lett are apparently enjoying life
immensely, and flourishing like the green bay
rubber-tree.
The society which exists to befriend animals
had an annual meeting last week, and an exhi-
bition of horrors displaying the different ways of
torturing beasts now most in vogue. But the
society missed a notable exhibit—a short, three-
act tragedy of bird-life, now shown in Mrs. Ellis
Rowan’s collection. The first picture (Act
I. shows the white heron on her nest. Act
11. pictures the bird lying dead, torn and
bleeding, where the exquisite feathers that form
the coveted ospreys of the fashionable woman
have been wrenched from the beautifully helpless
creature by a so-called civilised human being. Act
111. depicts three baby egrets slowly starving to
death in the nest to which the parent birds will
never return. To see these three little pictures is
to shudder at the thought of beholding an osprey
stuck in a woman’s hair. They are no morbid
exaggerations, but were painted by Mrs. Rowan
from photographs taken by Arthur Mattingly on
a Murray station belonging to a relative of Mrs.
Rowan. When staying at this place on the
Murray, the artist saw hundreds of these birds
lying dead on the ground after the slaughterers
had been busy. Next year the herons were almost
extinct. Is there any wonder ?
Every night is like a first night at “The
Arcadians.” That tuneful and cheery piece is a
boom. You feel as soon as you enter the crowded
theatre that you are in a happy land. The
atmosphere diffused all around the auditorium is
brisk and exhilarating. Women wear their best
theatre frocks and chatter pleasantly in the in-
tervals when they are not laughing at that jewel
of a jockey, Peter Doody. Old fogies Say this
opera reminds them of the days of the first Gaiety
Co. and the late but very much lamented Fred
Leslie, while the young and giddy playgoers are
content to make up theatre-parties that sparkle
at subsequent suppers. Maie Sydney is an
Arcadian in green and white lattice work and
sandalled trilbies ; and Florence Gilliam is a
fetching mundane in white, with a blue scarf,
which she knows how to wear. The pro-
gramme shouts aloud the names of the
front-rank costume-builders who supplied the
gowns that grace the racecourse lawn, but
they look as if the good old evergreen dressmaker
had" turned them out as per usual. For they are
distinctly not epoch-making, and only for the
megaphone aforesaid, would pass muster as nice
graceful gowns. When attention is thus forced
upon them, the still small voice of truth compels
the statement that they are just “ or’nary.” One
night last week a girl sat on the rocky seat that
looks o’er the stage from the centre of the D.C.,
and drew all eyes. The magnet was her hair.
Was it the latest coiffure from Paris or was it a
doormat? So gazers pondered, and most decided
it was odds on the latter supposition. I simply
couldn’t attempt to describe the construction.
An older companion looked like a matronly
geisha dressed for the part by a French maid.
Fashion is more freakish than ever. The
Turkish togs worn in “ The Brass Bottle,” at Her
Majesty’s, would not be so very unlike the mode
of the moment. Judging by what one reads of
the recent Grand Prix race-meeting at Long-
champs (France), the gowns thereat were as sensa-
tional as Lemberg’s defeat. The women wore
“audacious hats surmounted by lovely feathers.”
One young woman, who attracted much
attention, wore a confection of white and
gold, which, from the waist down, closely
resembled a Turkish lady’s dress. And as
she hobbled about in the paddock, with her
feet imprisoned at the ankles, quite a crowd fol-
lowed her, anticipating her immediate downfall.
It is the “tie band” round the skirt, already
seen in Sydney at the preliminary spring fashion-
peeps, which accomplishes this hobble. On the
imported model costumes there seems to be too
much top-hamper above the knees. Then they
take a reef or two in the mainsail, throw a line
around, and make all fast with a clove hitch.
This is a sailor man’s description of the new
spring styles, and it’s just as explanatory as any-
thing a dressmaker will tell you.
The most sensational event in “ The Brass
Bottle ” at Her Majesty’s is Dora Rignold’s white
gown, which looks as if she hadn’t anything else
on. Her tall and willowy figure is apparently
elongated by about 3ft. more. She has added
several superfluous cubits to her stature by wear-
ing that tightly-fitting robe. The women of the
cast are well robed. Mrs. Futvoye is a stylish
mother-iri-law that any man might be proud of. A
well-worn plum-colored tunic with a deep fringe on
the same colored skirt suggests silk cashmere
in its soft drapings. Apart from the Turkish-
bath-like gorgeousness of the palace, sent as a
surprise packet by the Jinnee to Horace Venti-
more, the two prettiest scenes are the Futvoye
drawing-room and the Savoy “Pinafore” suite.
In the drawing-room there is more comfort, if less
cushion, than in the gorgeous Bagdad apartment,
and the western mode of eating is de-
cidedly cleaner than the dish-grabbing -form
of meal practised by the sons of Islam.
Though, as a freak dinner, the Jinnee’s feast
would be an improvement on some American
notions in that line. Anyhow, the coffee
must be all right. As the mysterious stranger who
was so fond of bottles that he lived in one for
thousands of years, Evelyn Howard looks his
part in a misty green bath robe and a largo coni-
cal turban. The fashions in Jinn land don’t alter
much in a millennium or two.
Yours, as of old,
CLEO.
“ Permanent ” writes
In its annual report the N.S.W. Public Service Associa-
tion is making 1 the dust fly with its feet because there are
2000 temporary employees under the Board, most of
them holding jobs that could be filled by permanent
hands. These latter find promotion stopped because of
the way the Act is evaded. The journey up the Public
Service ladder is a tedious business for the permanent
hand. Having passed a competitive exam, young Red-
tapk gets a job at £5O a year. Statutory increments take
him gradually to £llO. Then he has to leap another
hurdle in the shape of an exam., and after that he can
attain the dazzling pinnacle of £l5O. Still another
exam, is necessary before he can shift off this mark, and
even then he depends on the whim of the Board, as no one
has a right to go up over £l5O. Then Redtape has to in-
sure his life for a heavy sum, and pass the doctor regard-
ing his general bodily condition. On the other hand, the
temporary man knows a member or a Cabinet Minister,
and this person gets him in at a wage of perhaps 10s. or
12s. 6d.,0r 15s. a day. He has no exams., no insurance,
no doctor. He may start beyond the point where the
Permanent leaves off. All he has not got is security of
tenure, but as some of the Temporaries have 10 to 20
years’ service that isn’t a very bad worry. It is easy to
see that this temporary employment business strikes
at, the heart of the Public Service Act. And
the Temporaries who have obtained good jobs
by calmly ignoring all the requirements of the
Act are a constant source of irritation to the Permanents
whose promotion they are blocking. The Association,
which is cussing as above, calmly proposes, and Wade has
acquiesced in the proposal, to appoint to the permanent
staff all the present temporary 2000. These men cannot
be npw subjected to the examination tests, certainly not
the competitive entrance exam. If they are all appointed
at their present pay, and not reduced to the £l5O mark,
there will be trouble ahead for the P. S. Association. It
cannot serve two masters, and in its anxiety to secure the
subscriptions of the temporary crowd it overlooks the
antagonism of the permanent staff. These last don’t see
their danger yet, but when they wake up to it I prophesy
battle, murder and sudden stoush.
The monopolistic Melbourne Tram Co. an-
nounces its intention to pay a bonus of 5. per cent,
to employees of two years’ standing who are not
connected with any trade union. This co.
doesn’t give bonuses to employees for amuse-
ment, or because they look well. It only does
such things because it reckons they are good
business. But, if it pays this co. to aim such a
blow at trade unionism—in other words, if Mel-
bourne really likes a co. that will throw mud at
trade unionism in this way—then Melbourne is
in a pitiful state. One suggested explanation
of the mystery is that the bonus is intended
to prejudice Hannah’s Bill for a Tramway Wages
Board. As a matter of fact, it ought to have
precisely the opposite effect. In a business
in which a strong trade union was encouraged
a wages board might not be necessary to secure
for the workmen a square deal. On the other
hand, the men who work for a concern which
bribes them to keep out of a trade union are
almost certain to go to the wall unless they have
a wages board. Men must have either a strong
trade union or a wages board ; and if their union
is weakened through a system of bribes, then
their only hope is through a board or some other
sort of arbitration.
N.S.W. Treasurer Waddell banged the show-
man’s big drum one day last week, and asked the
electors to observe that the Government had pro-
duced a surplus of £989,000 for the past year.
Waddell naturally didn’t mention two or three
things that are worth remembering. He didn’t,
for instance, allude to the fact that the receipts
from the sale of land and other assets were pro-
bably in excess of the whole £989,000, and that
receipts from the sale of land and other assets
shouldn’t be regarded as ordinary revenue at all.
The Anthony Hordern people could, no doubt,
sell their big shop next year, and if they threw
the proceeds into the cash-box, the “surplus,”
after paying wages, etc., would be swollen by
about half a million. But they wouldn’t be any
better off ; they would have the half-million, but
they wouldn’t have the shop, and thereafter
their real surplus would be less because their
expenditure would go up through having to pay
rent. As long as Governments sell land, etc., and
throw the proceeds in with the ordinary revenue,
a Treasurer can make his surplus pretty well what
he pleases. The amount is only limited by the
quantity of land he has to sell and the number of
buyers at the price he asks. Also, as long as a
Government goes in for “ a vigorous loan policy ”
its Treasurer can make the surplus pretty well
what he pleases, by the simple process of paying
out of loans for things that ought to be paid for
out of revenue. If a man with £5OO a year pays
out £4OO in the ordinary way, and borrows £2OO
to pay the grocer and the landlord, he can
show a surplus of £lOO provided he forgets
all about the 1.0. U. But if he is honest enough
to remember the 1.0. U., then he won’t show
any surplus at all, but a deficit of £lOO. N.S.W.
finance has been run on those lines lately. Wade-
Waddell have sold every foot of ground they
could get a buyer for, and their borrowings have
been tremendous. In fact, Waddell has bor-
rowed a great deal more than he did in the year,
not so long ago, when the Wade crowd, then led
by Carruthers, threw him out on the ground
that he was too dangerous a financier to be left a
minute longer at the Treasury.

THE,
IDEAL GIFT
PIANO.
HERE is no gift costing a like amount that is so impressive, so in
keeping with the whole spirit of giving, as a STECK PIANOLA
-*■ PIANO. Its dignity, its beauty, the splendid possibilities for
musical enjoyment it offers to everyone have made it a favorite with those
who wish to express more than the usual amount of esteem or affection in
their giving.
People do not buy fine paintings and then hang them where they cannot
be seen. Neither do people buy books printed in a language that they do not
understand. Why, then, should they buy pianos which they cannot play ?
A STECK PIANOLA PIANO means music of the kind that people
enjoy most. That is—music that is actually being played by some one , and
not mechanical music in any sense of the word.
IF there are half a dozen members of your household, and you have a
STECK PIANOLA PIANO, you can soon tell from another room
just who is playing it. The perfection of the STECK PIANOLA
PIANO’S construction, and its absolute control of effects, make it as
sensitive to the performer as any hand-played instrument, and distinguish
it from all its imitators.
If you are thinking of buying a Piano, or making a present of one,
surely the Piano that is always a real musical instrument and never simply
an ornament, is the one to bhy.
ANYONE, no matter Kow far removed his or her previous life may
have been from music, can play and enjoy the PIANOLA PIANO at once.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 1, 1910.
Mr Dear Yarrie, —
Mrs. Mayoral Burston gave a party to speed
the parting Asches. Instead of employing the
cavern of the Town Hall itself, Mrs. Burston
annexed the Council Chamber and two other
rooms of importance upstairs, where the beautiful
square balcony makes an extra apartment with
grey columns and walls of striped awning. The
corridor there makes further spreading space—so
the affair was sumptuous yet comfortable, and
carefully shovelled into corners. Dago Di Gilio
was given the landing and corridor therein to
“maka de music” and “playa de fid,” while on a
platform in the large reception room, the large
Maggie Stirling boomed her large voice and
“Trally” Foster (that darling of the girls)
warbled in his divine tenor.
Mrs. Burston glittered in black top-dressing
with creamy feathers in her hat. Miss Burston
hit up the corn color of her hair with a grey garb
in the most approved poetic fashion. The Guest
—“Lil ” of the Asches—simply rode over every-
body else. The undermost garment visible to the
naked eye was clinging green satin. Over this
hung Paisley—no matter what material; it was
silken and Paisley ; therefore it shouted. If any-
one wrapped herself in grandmamma’s Paisley
shawl she could rise with the Cream without a
push. The Lily Brayton Paisley pretentiousness
was grappled at the waist with cords (just like
grandpa’s dressing-gown), and on her head was
a granny bonnet, making a green frame for
her bright face. This head garniture fairly
sprouted with black feathers. Oscar of the
Asches could not go far in dress owing to his
masculinity and the want of a stage, but he
caught the limelight with a good-bye speech.
The Mayoress saw to it that Everybody turned
up. All the stray titles our city possesses were
“among those present,” and the Elevated of the
land in general appeared on deck. The Asches
departed next day, and called back, “See you all
in two years.” Wonder if the boom will renew,
supposing we do see them again in two years.
The Glassy Harem, which is whirling through
quite a society season this year (the Glassy looms
and drops on alternate winters and so strikes an
average), is finding its sensation of the moment in
two matrimonial engagements that are apparently
cried off. There is much thrillsome speculation
as to which jilted who. Then there are a pair of
divorces in view. So we are being kept busy.
The Coopers, those stage-struck damsels who
used to drag society to the theatre to see them
lean up against a priina donna, are bursting into
the limelight on a new stage. The newest sensa-
tion is a manicure shop.
A delightful story is told of how a certain
highly-decorative she, who is the expensive friend
of a landowner and speculator, was introduced to
a distinguished official personage. The gaudy
lady, having been absent when the personage
took office, had never seen him before, and was
seemingly unacquainted with his photo; but a
lady friend of hers, who is also a shining light in
the world, had met the gentleman on a steamer
under circumstances equally respectable and de-
ceptive. The two stylish females took a run over
to Sydney together, and at the railway station
they chanced to meet the Personage, whom only
the one siren knew even by sight. To her the
gentleman paid his respects in his most affably
condescending manner, whereupon she introduced
her dashing pal, taking the precaution to change
the “Miss” into “Mrs.” But her dashing pal
didn’t take the Personage seriously. She thought
his title was only “spoof,” and in her own frank,
breezy way she said, “Rats! Tell me, sonny,
who are you, really?” The story ends here.
Anyway, the feelings of the Exalted One when
he was addressed as “sonny ” would be unfit for
publication.
Somebody suggests that the luckiest of all the
dames who live luxuriously in the separated state
is the one who caught her elderly hubby gallivant-
ing with her “double.” A handsome allowance
seems an unfair penalty to levy on a Lothario
whose indiscretion is almost a compliment. With
so many charmers to choose from, the poor man
picked one who was as like his wife as the pro-
verbial other pea in a pod. Such.duplication is
the sincerest form of flattery.
There looms divorce—not on the very highest
branch of the social tree, but still in the tree.
The two married young. They have ganged
their ain gait in a friendly enough way, tea-ing
and doing other social events with divers part-
ners. Now the lady makes her husband jealous
with a “Steddy”—a continuous escort, and a
bestower of furry coverings and other trifles. It
is understood to be the continuosity and the
obviosity and the furriness that the husband
objects to.
At a crowded theatre, the other night, one box
held a brilliant party, including a girl who cared
not to hide her light (nor her back) under a bushel
nor in the shade of the sheltering plush curtains.
She had gleaming hair and quite a quantity of
“ nood ” shoulder and back. She stood up every
now and then, and turned her dimpled back-
scheme to the house. She was, appa-
rently, looking for notice—and she got it.
The gods got on to the business and began
to applaud the back. The lady retired in con-
fusion to the dark depths of the box, and only
crept out when the lights went down. But the
gods were waiting. They howled and whistled
and shrieked, and a super on the stage wondered
if he would be offered “ lead ’’ after such an ova-
tion. The vision of loveliness again retreated,
covered with confusion. She sneaked back, half
an act later, disguised in the discreet envelopment
of a capacious cloak, and sat subdued, to watch
out the rest of the play.
The catch of the season is rumored with great
strength. Jessie, the unwedded last of the
Landale beauties who went wandering abroad
with papa, has, it seems, kept her heart for home.
Robert Murchison —the biggest gun of the ex-
clusive Melbourne Club set—is reported to be
the winner of the girl. Allowing weight for age
—the groom-elect is about 65 years young—it is
just about the best thing doing, according to
feminine notions of a match.
There has been grave discussion about a suc-
cessor to “ Money ” Bevan at the Coll ins-street
church while that comfortable gentleman is abroad
gathering foreign impressions. Great flutter and
disturbance arose among the gentle she-angels
when the Powers chose Leyton Richards, M. A.,
and announced him as a youngster of 32. Now
official notices of his approach and condition
include the bald statement that Mr. Richards is
married. He is a Glasgow man and studied at
the adjacent city of Auld Reekie ; so, possibly, his
wife is a Maggie, well primed with What Every
Woman Knows.
Hal Brasch, the champion boat-pusher in our
most reoent Henley meetings, is getting a minor
into training for the Diamond Sculls. The
youngster —a son—made his first earthly howl
about a week ago, and the new father struts
proudly.
Ex-Governor George Sydenham Clarke, who
left us in 1903, has collected another Mrs. Clarke.
The new annexe is a widow from India’s tiger-
haunted strand. Announcements invariably end
with a bald statement of the date of the last wife’s
decease at the very end of 1908. It is not too long
for regrets, to be sure ; but, then, Clarke is aged
62 and couldn’t be expected to wait any longer
ere picking up a pacemaker.
A giddy club man, much about town, has caused
comment by his sudden absence. “The boys”
see him no more nowadays. He is in strict
seclusion in his Far North sheep run, vegetating
in grass-widowerhood. He is a newly-made
grandfather. The force of such a reminder
of his age and responsibilities must have
been too great a shock to his jauntiness. For the
moment he decided to feel old and play the game.
Unto Josiah Thomas, P.M.G., was lately pre-
sented a Master Thomas. This makes the fourth
baby born to the Commonwealth Ministry since
April 13, the wives of Fisher, Tudor and Pearce
having also become mothers in recent days.
Pearce, by the way, has called his infant Lloyd
George, which is rough on the infant.
Did anyone notice that Mark Twain arrived
with Halley’s comet and the comet took him off
again ? He was born at comet time last trip, and
his erratic constellation made its first appearance
on the day of his death. Mark Twain always had
quaint conceits about comets. His “Captain
Stormfield’s Visit to Heaven ” brings in a jolly
old comet, and that book was a particular boon to
Clemens. He wrote it after the big clean-up of
his fortune. “ Stormfield ’’ brought good, money,
and Mark Twain built a comfortable home in the
country. He called the house “Stormfield.” It
reminds one of Barrie’s “ Noble Sims,” who
pasted on each piece of furniture the newspaper
article that paid for it.
I saw the ghost of Ernest Raleigh spooking
through town, t’other day, wandering drearily
without his froeky other half. They keep to
Sydney side nowadays, and nestle down in a
corner of Rose Bay. Mrs. Froeky spends less
time on elaborate decoration of her pretty self;
in fact, she is even known to spend a whole even-
ing and dinner time without getting into the
decollete of the dress that is full by name' and
skimpy by nature. How dinner food tastes when
one is not in dinner dress, it is hard to imagine.
When the beauteous two flatted sumptuously at
the Grand, practically every evening saw a new
picture in sartorial subtlety.
Walter Wimble Berry, the golden-haired dar-
ling of the tea-merchant Berry clan, has annexed
a widow in Canada, and the family is simmering
over quaint invitation cards and other parapher-
nalia. Mamma and Papa Berry are wandering
abroad, and were to reach Canada for the event.
The widow is a young thing to match the bride-
groom. Also, she is wealthy and beautiful and
altogether desirable. She was Mrs. Thompson
before she Berried herself.
The Carlyle Smythes are cheerful swallows.
The latest chirp conies from the snow peaks
around Innsbruck, where they made a summer
halt. That is to say, it was summer by the card ;
but the thermometer gets tired when it has
climbed to about 60° in the shade in that delect-
able region. The Smythes, when they wrote,
were just about leaving the frigidity for Munich,
where there is Wagner and lager beer.
The prophecy of charity shows was no false
stunt. They are hitting Melbourne like a rain of
brickbats. The Children’s Hospital gets up to
squeak. The surgical ward of that institution
has been condemned by the Board of Health and
the chief of the Fire Brigade. It could scarcely be
more thoroughly damned. There are about7oo poor
little sick babies being cared for annually, and
the work of getting a new ward should be helped.
An energetic crowd has grabbed the Princess’s
for two odd dates—August 13 and 15. The Mel-
bourne Amateur Operatic Co., with Captain
Maudesley and Molly Carew in the lead, will
play “La Fille de Madame Ang6t.” Mr. John
Wallace is producing the rather spicy French
opera, and Cyril Brinkley bangs the conductor’s
baton.
Marshall Hall, the lover of Art—he who wor-
ships only at the shrine of her pure beauty—
attracted a certain amount of attention lately.
The new Victorian Professional Orchestra, which
is a youngster of a few months old, but is growing
lustily, had a concert on Saturday afternoon.
The V. P. Orchestra is made up of Unionist men
only. The powers at the back of non-unionist
Marshall Hall sent circulars to all known music-
lovers inviting them to a free rehearsal of their
hundredth concert, in the Guild Hall, at two
o’clock on Saturday. The V.P.O. played in the
Town Hall at three o’clock. That was a below-the-
wind belt for the new orchestral youngster. There
has never been even a crack in the fence for a
listener at previous rehearsals, and no one ever
heard the word “ invitation ” whispered.
Freddie Beard took the spring-board at the
Saturday concert of the Victorian Professional
Orchestra. This is the second he has beaten into
blaring expression. Bertie Zelman has conducted
two, and Andrew MacCunn was to have polished
up the next, only an urgent comic opera company
dragged him away betimes. MacCunn gave up
the blessed holes of the golf-links to listen to the
Saturday harmony, and Tallis beamed placidly
from the back of the balcony. Comedian Wright
seemed to be soothed by the music—he has been
a devotee at any old musical matinee since his
advent here. Little Dr. Maloney and a fellow
politician tucked their hands in their pockets and
forgot orations for the hour, whilst the Marshall
Hall devotees stayed conspicuously away. The
house grows every time. There have been three
Thursday afternoon concerts. Now the orchestra
attacks Saturday and competes with football and
other out-door rages.
Slapoffski will come over from Sydney to con-
duct the second Saturday afternoon concert,
which is fixed for August 27. Slap, is billed as
“Herr.” Where does he get the Herr? He is
not German—his pedigree, in fact, is Russo-
Cockney ; but I suppose a ski on the end of one’s
name demands something more that plain Mr.
It seems a wild hanker after a title of some sort.
Beard gave the fanciful “Nut-cracker Suite,”
evolved from the brain of the sneezy Tschai-
kowsky. It is full of delirious dances. The
Arabian dance is a languorous thing of much
melody. For the “Sugar Plum Fairy” dance
J. C. Williamson lent his celesta—which he
lately bought from Allan’s—the only one of its
kind in Australia. Conductor MacCunn wove a
delicate accompaniment from it for Roberts’
“ Wayside Flower ” song in “ The Waltz Dream,”
and he kept the thing hidden and the audience
guessing. Harper Barker, who played the “Sugar
Plum ” air, had the machine in full view at the
concert, It is like a harpsichord or a very young
treble piano. The instrument was invented by
Tschaikowsky originally for this very theme, and
it is beginning to thrive in orchestras abroad.
An Australian has gone gathering glory in
South Africa. She is a baby violinist named
Katie Silva, her age is 11 years, and she got away
with the gold medal at the last Eisteddfod in
Johannesburg. She was a pupil of Foley West-
wood, one of the most juvenile of Melbourne
violin teachers, and Foley (who is almost blind)
wears his feather most modestly. The 11-year-
old managed to annex several engagements right
away on the strength of-her success.
Stage-manager Meyer, of the Asche company,
evidently thinks Australia a good wicket. He
proposes to return to Victoria, and is “going on
the land.” He has bought a place somewhere
about Yea. His wife, Dorothy Grimston, is
happy with her two youngsters, and the quartette
intends to live joyously ever after with the cow
and the corn for company.
Men are thinking that, before ladies really get
into Parliament, it would be well to hurry through
a Dress Limitation Bill. The first clause must
deal, of course, with big hats. That is an ever-
present shadow upon a man’s social and theatrical
life. Clause 11. will sternly regulate the width
of a woman’s skirt. Tight skirts may be funny
to the man in the street, but they are quite other-
wise to the tram man. A woman fell off aCollins-
street car t’other day because she absolutely could
not step. The male tram-travellers foresee the
time when they will have to bodily lift women on
and off, and there are times of the day when men
are scarce and women very plentiful. At these
hours a small and lonesome male might as well be
a coal-lumper. And if man once begins to lift
lovely, heavy woman off the car he may next be
expected to carry her to the pavement.
Voluminous skirts, according to fashion, mea-
sure l£yd. just at present, but fashion-plates get
themselves into a yard circumference just above
the ankles. Walk in a gunny bag, and one gets
the same graceful effect. One brilliant light of
Melbourne society hooks the base of her skirt to
the tops of her boots and shuffles to her motor.
Mamma’s maiden aunt says, “Oh, my dear! —
what if a bull should chase you ! ” No, there’d be
no chance of running, let alone shinning up a
tree. Women will yet evolutionise, into mono-
legs or mermaids. The strangest part of the
fashion is this: The skirt takes an infinitesimal
area of cloth, yet the tailor’s bill comes out just
the same as of old, only more so.
The gorgeous Springthorpe tomb at Kew is to
be surpassed, they say, by the statuary adorn-
ments of a wealthy widower’s family vault at
Brighton Cemetery. Side by side with the effigy
of his dead daughter will be placed a life-sized
figure of her mother, which should be more im-
pressive than the effect of the profusely gold-
lettered memorial at the other burying-ground.
It is whispered that the Richmond engine
carried the same number as the machine which
made the Sunshine holocaust. Possibly it was
the same deadly implement. Let us hope that
driver Milburn is not spooking. He left here on
the Waratah. It is not known for certain even
yet whether he is with the drowned or whether
he left the boat at Durban.
Don’t know why the city should let itself get
so far behind the times when the country booms
in its frivols. At a Melbourne dance a pro-
gramme is curiously limited—a set of lancers,
several waltzes and myriad two-steps make a menu
as meagre of variety as an Englishman’s dinner.
Listen to this card from a country dance.
There is a varsoviana. How could anyone
be happy without unravelling the mystery of that ?
Among the common or garden waltz, polka and
schottisehe, come spicy things like a march waltz,
a waltz cotillon, and something about an Irish
stew. Dance 22 is dubbed the “ Fitzroys.” This
precious programme reached me through the
hands of a lucky wandering man, but I’ll never be
content again until I have experienced the flavor
of a varsoviana ora Fitzroy. No wonder a self-
respecting country dance needs its M.C.—things
like that couldn’t go through without a stage
manager.
From “Rosna,” of Adelaide :
The Elder Hall wore a bright smile am) a flower in ifs
buttonhole on Monday of last week because the Oban-
eellor Ways were giving a party. The guest of honor
was the Rev. W. Temple, M.A., whose late father was
headmaster of Rugby, and afterwards Archbishop of
Canterbury. His Ex. and Lady Bosanquet went to the
party ; also, the nabobs of the University, the Parlia-
ment and its wife, the upper crust and its eldest daughter,
the landed gentry and its girl, and the clergy and a row
of nice white-clad girl-graduates. The Elder Hall blos-
somed as the rose ; and afternoon tea burst into bud at
the psychological -moment. And between times Dr.
Ennis played “See the Conquering Hero Comes,” or
some other Brahms rhapsody, on the organ.
The committee that has been out hunting S. Australian
facts to support the Dudley lady’s Bush Nursing scheme,
has made its report. This is to the effect that the flourish-
ing District Trained Nurses’Association—a feather which
we wave proudly in this State’s millinery—embraces all the
functions of the proposed scheme, and it would be un-
wise to bring in a new organisation to interfere or com-
pete with it.
Elizabeth Delprat, the tall and musical olive-branch of
the m m who is managing monarch of the Broken Hill
Proprietary mine, has put all the foreign fiddling lads
and lasses at the Conservatoire of Ghent into aback seat,
having been awarded first prize for violin-playing at the
Conservatoire’s final examination. She took her talents
to the old Flemish city some years ago, after receiving-
much local tuition, and for some time now has been
leader of the orchestra at the place to which the good
news was taken in the Browning piece we used to elocute
at school.
Hvmen was employed recently to knot Mr. Frank Giles
and Miss Ethelwyn Strawbridge, the handsome daughter
of the Surveyor-General. The new housekeepers will
dwell somewhere near the feet of the hills which we keep
to show visitors.
The Creswells, who belonged to South Aus. before we
handed over our navy to the Commonwealth, are
triumphing over the prowess of their son. The lad is a
cadet at the Naval College, Dartmouth (England), and he
has just captured the swimming challenge cup there.
The Melbourne express brought us a precious cargo on
Friday morn. It consisted of Calv 6. The joyous owner
of the Voice had not slept in the train, and therefore the
crowd which took its. nosegays to meet, her was only
allowed half a glimpse of her before she was whisked off
for a nap. In the afternoon, however, a refreshed and
fur-clad divinity held a kind of court, with her interpret-
ing companion to ward off the bad French of intruders
On the same night the Bach Society serenaded her and
presented her with a chiastolite pendant: chiastolite
being a “lucky” stone we dig up from our dark interior
—a'Stone that" wears on its face the sign of the cross in
white on a dark ground.
The A. W. Styleses, who are the head municipals ol
Thebarton, turned the local Town Hall into a flower-
garden for the ratepayers on Friday evening. Henry
Brose, Alexander Cooper, and some smaller exponents of
good noise, with a string band, made music for the tax-
payers. Then there was supper, and after that dancing.
Adelaide’s polar heyo, Douglas Mawson, has been lec-
turing us on Antarctic matters. He began it arrayed as
Solomon might have been if he had expected to meet an
iceberg ; but he gradually moulted most of the glory.
Amidst a deal of science, he dropped a hint of domestic
fconomy. With one lone gallon of kerosene he and Pro-
fessor David cooked three meals a day for three pole-
hunters for 17 davs. If rents are as cheap as fuel m
Shackleton-screet, Poleville, we are due to move there.
Our electric trams are beginning to get some deadly-
work in ; but their latest fatality was not their fault. A
lady of 57 was travelling on an open cross-seated car.
Suddenly she announced that she had lost her purse (as
a matter of fact she had left it at home on the table), and
she simply stepped off the fast-moving car and was picked
up dying. The Tramway Trust justly remarks that it
was not to blame.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.
From the Oldest Inhabitant :
The North Sydney Council has revived the old name of
Thrupp at Neutral Bay. Thrupp was a lieutenant in th e
Navy ; and while his ship was in Sydney in the ’twenties
he married a daughter of Captain John Piper, the naval
officer after whom Point Piper is named. A grant of
land was, of course, easily obtained ; something like 600
acres were passed over to Thrupp. This property
extended from Neutral Bay to Middle Harbor. Old
maps show “Thrupo’s grant.” The lieutenant lived in
a cottage which stood where the Hayes-street wharf now
is. Ages agone, Thrupp, for a consideration, transferred his
grant to the Coopers, who sublet it in large blocks to
many tenants on the usual 99 years’ lease. Before that
time, Thrilpps-road used to be in the directories ; but
“Thrupps” gave way to “ Kurrabba,” the native name
of the nose formerly known as Thrupp’s Point. Some
years ago a manufacturing magnate named Hayes lived
here—Paddy Hayes. He made bricks, and tried to make
glass, and a street running down from Eaymond-road to
Kurrabba-road was named after him. The council has
now wiped out Paddy and resurrected Thrupp. Which,
on the whole, is no improvement. For a man who tried
to establish a glass-making industry in the early days is
better worth remembering than a mere naval johnny
who married a girl, got a Crown grant thrown in, and
sold his little lot of land when the unearned increment
made it worth while.


The
Winters Tale ” of the Complexion.
A Hint or Two How to keep it Safe and Sound.
[HAVE before me as I write a tiny volume of Shakespeare’s “ Winter’s Tale
dedicated to Miss Ellen Terry. That play has marked important events in the
career of this wonderful woman. It was the first play in which she appeared
before the English public, and 50 years later it furnished Miss I erry with her last
Shakespearian part. . . .
In her Memoirs, which she has lately published, Miss Terry recites this incident
concerning Sarah Bernhardt “ Miss Sarah has been talking to Henry Irving, and
while so engaged she took some red stuff out of her bag and rubbed it on her lips.”
This story just serves as a handy peg on which to hang my talk on how one.
should take care of the lips during the winter.
Next to the nose, which is the first outpost of the face to weather
every vicissitude of the atmosphere, it is the lips that are called upon
to bear the brunt of the “ chiding of the winter’s wind.” The
membrane of the lips is the tenderest part of the face, and
the cracking or chapping caused by the cold or wind are not
only painful but a decided drawback to beauty. To
moisten them with the tongue, an unseemly habit, and
then expose them to the cold or wind only tends to
make matters worse. The great principle of a wise and
rational care of the lips in winter is to cover them with
a thin film of emollient substance, through which the
blast of cold winds cannot penetrate. Such a protective
preparation is found in the Valaze Lip Lustre. It not
only safeguards the delicate outer membrane of the lips
against cracks, chaps and sores, but is also the best
remedy when they have already appeared.
Another important matter to guard against during the
winter is the flushing of the nose and cheeks during the
cold weather. Fortunately sufferers from this unsightly
affliction can obtain relief and moderation of the flushing out-
breaks by the use of the Valaze Liquidirie and the Novena Red
Nose Ointment and Powder. The nose should be rubbed
thoroughly with a pledget of wool moistened with the Liquidine,
before going out. This treatment re-establishes perfect circulation in the organ,
and prevents the undesirable redness. It also acts as a means against the
effect of the cold. The Novena Red Nose Ointment and Powder are used at night
only. For this trouble there is a more thorough, deeper-going, exclusive and unfail-
ing treatment practised at the Valaze Institutes in Melbourne and Sydney.
Now, concerning the care of the face in general. It is not the easiest of tasks
to take care of the skin during the winter, unless it has been intelligently safeguarded
during the summer and autumn. But if you are ready and willing to pay the price
of vigilance for a good complexion, the first rule is to protect the skin from exposure
to the cold winds and frost. For this purpose a thin coating of Valaze Skin Food or
,
SgSfi*
■
BH
Sunproof Creme will prove very beneficial.' The dusting on of a little Valaze cr
Novena Poudre will complete all precautionary measures, so that not only the sun,
but the dust and wind will be quite powerless to harm the most delicate skin.
When returning home the skin should be cleansed with a little Valaze Skin
Food or Novena Cerate, either of which preparations will revitalise the skin and
cause it to glow with healthy beauty.
One of the most important facts to be pointed out is that on no condition
should water be used more than once a day for washing the face' duting the winter.
The water should be tepid, and the soap a mild, soothing soap, like the Valaze
Complexion Soap, which is perfect for toilet use, and preferably together
with the Valaze Voskpasta, which softens, cleanses and refines the skin,
rendering it delightfully soft, fresh and humid.
For an unsightly affliction, which is at all times prevalent
among Australian girls, the Valaze Blackhead and Open Pore
Cure will prove ever effective. It cleanses the pores, removes
blackheads, refines the skin’s texture, and overcomes greasi-
ness, coarseness and acne.
Following these few simple rules you will be
delighted with the condition of your skin during the
winter. You will find that the machinery of your com-
plexion will not experience a “ breakdown,” and will not
require any repairs at the hands of “ beauty specialists
to be set right for the next season in town.
The prices of the preparations mentioned in this
course of winter treatment are: — ValazeSkin Food and
Beautifier, 3s. 6d. and 6s. 6d, 6d. postage. Novena
Cerate, 3s. 6d. and 2s. a jar. Novena Sunproof

box. Valaze Liquidine, ss. and Bs. 6d. a bottle; and

Concerning the work at the Yalaze Massage Institutes, send for Mile.
Rubin-
c;—4-
stein’s book, “ Beauty in the Making,” and call at the Valaze Rooms at your tirst
opportunity. The treatments are perfectly wonderful in their methods of banishing
lines, wrinkles and that jaded appearance, and restoring the skin to its normal
beauty. There is an expert staff in attendance, and the needs of each client are
made a specialty of.

SUFFERERS FROM OVER-STOUTNESS.
How They May Cuke Themselves.
In the first place, it must not be lost sight of
that food is the very fuel of vitality. So many
people who are alarmed by the first symptoms of
an obese tendency are prone to sacrifice themselves
to a sparing and innutritious dietary, and to
exercise themselves out of all reason. There is no
cure for obesity in such physical abuses. The
human organism requires gentler treatment. We
are glad to give our stout readers the benefit of a
splendid recipe which they can make up them-
selves (or get the'r chemist to do so), and by means
of which they may cure themselves, without the
least physical discomfort, of obesity in any of its
stages. The prescription is One half-ounce of
Marmola, one ounce of fluid Extract of Glycyr-
rhiza 8.P., one ounce of pure Glycerine 8.P.,
with peppermint water to make six ounces in all.
Dose: Two teaspoonfuls after each meal. This
isimple and harmless home treatment entails
nothing restrictive—no fasting, po exhausting
exercises. Hence, while the superfluous fatty
matter is being rapidly removed the subject as
rapidly regains strength and stamina through
properly digested food in rational qualities, the
whole alimentary system being toned up and re-
fortified. It is a beautiful and most efficacious
method of self cure which no over-stout person
should neglect.*

NEVER NEGLECT A BAD COLD.
Never allow a cold to run its course. Too often
its course is towards pneumonia. The first action
when you have a cold should be to relieve the
lungs. This is best accomplished by the free use
of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. -This medicine
liquefies the tough mucus and opens the secretions.
A complete cure soon follows.*
TAKEN EVERY YEAR
TO THE HOSPITAL,
O
With Violent Attacks of
Sciatica.
o
This Man Suffered for Fourteen
Years but at last found a cure.
»
Every year, for 14 years, as the cold weather of
June came on, Mr. W. Clarke, 214 Gouger Street,
Adelaide, S.A., was taken with crippling attacks
of sciatica, and had to be taken to the hospital,
where he would be an inmate for three or four
weeks. Not a single year in 14 was he without an
attack, but he passed the fifteenth without a
sign of Sciatica. He had found a cure. Acting
on the experience of others who had been cured
by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, he tried them and
obtained wonderful relief. The following are
Mr. Clarke’s own words :
“Some years back I got several severe wettings
when out.tishing, Subsequently I was subject to
severe sciatic pains, particularly in the back of
the hips. The pains were as if someone was
driving a knife into my hips. For 14 years every
June I have had to go to the hospital, with the
result that I had to stay there each time for three
or four weeks. I would leave the hospital very
little better than when I went in. About eight
months since I saw an advertisement in a paper
abuut cures effected by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
and having heard people talk about them also,
I determined to give them a trial, and I am glad
I did. My wife bought one box at Guenthers,
the chemist in Gouger Street, and I started taking
them. I found so much benefit from the first box
that I bought two more boxes, and have felt so
Well since that this is the first year I have not had
to go to the hospital for past 15 years. Any of
my neighbors can tell you what I suffered for
years, and of the wonderful improvement in my
health since I took Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and
now, although I am 59 years of age, I can do more
work than I could at aiiy time during my previous
15 or 20 years. I can sleep and eat and enjoy
life as well as any man of my age, and I attribute
it all to my use of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, my
only regret being I did not use them before.”
Remember, only the genuine Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills cure. Don’t be gulled into taking
something said to be just as good. Of all dealers

POLTICAL
POINTS
The words of “ Jean Sibi ” :
I see that Puller, M.H.R., proposes that a monument
“ with six faces representing the six Slates ” should be
erected on the Yassberra site. Certainly, but why all
this facial extravagance? Why not make the monument
simply two-faced by sticking up a statue of Mahon and
Hughes? The figure of either person in stone or brass
(brass preferred) would suit Fuller’s purpose and be a
striking memorial into the bargain. It would com-
memorate the man who had the face to believe in the
Referendum as a theory, and the face to hate it as a
practice on this particular cpiestion.
S. Australia was given a loolf-in at the
country around the Yassberra Federal capital
site the other day. Somebody wrote to the
Register asking what the country was like for
settlement. The Register sent the question on to
the N.S. W. Lands Department. And the N.S. \V.
Lands Department answered that the territory
itself wasn’t available, though the surrounding
country was. It pointed out how the land might
be taken up ; and then added : “ But the country
consists chiefly of steep granite ranges of inferior
grazing capacity.” It’s a cheerful prospect
altogether—dead rabbits inside the area and
steep granite ranges outside.
The whoop of an Australian in England
who wants his country to think a bit better of
itself :
You just need to take a trip to Europe from Australia
to realise how up-to-date in most things Australia really
is. At every Australian port—-Sydney, H barf,, Mel-
bourne, Port Adelaide and Fremantle—the big P. and O.
ship lay alongside a wharf ; but never again till we got
into Tilbury Docks were we able to land without a
tender. Colombo, Suez, Port Said, Naples, Marseilles,
Gibraltar and even Plymouth could not (at any rate they
did not) accommodate us.
Still, though it is something for the Australian to
feel good about, he might feel even better if, in-
stead of having such facilities for landing the im-
ported saucepan, his country had more facilities
for making the saucepan on the spot.
A paragraph in Melb. Age (26/7/TO) threw
what looks like a streak of light on the Rich-
mond wreck :
The delays in the introduction of the lock and block
signalling system on the Victorian railways become
more extraordinary and inexplicable when compared
with the advances made in Ne\^ South Wales. The Vic-
torian Department has fitted the Sykes apparatus to only
two suburban railway sections, although the system was
officially accepted six years ago. The New South Wales
Department has gone far ahead. It has had the lock and
block signalling for years, and now is installing a new
system known as the electro pneumatic.
Victoria, the land of big estates, and antiquated
railway apparatus, and ill-paid, overworked rail-
way servants, seems likely to get a mighty bad
name before somebody contrives to sit on the
head of this Richmond ghost and jam it into its
coffin. But while the western lines wander
through the unpeopled wildernesses of the big
estates, earning next to nothing, where is the
money for up-to-date-apparatus to come from ?
A recent cry by Abbott, of the Victorian
House of Ditched Landlords, was one of the most
interesting noises heard for an age. Standing up
in the place where the Landlords congregate, he
cried that the proposed Federal land-tax would
drag £404,000 out of the pockets of Victorian land-
owners. The intense silence that greeted this
statement was partly dispersed by an interjection
from Labor-member Evans. Said Evans quietly :
“ We could have had that money for the State ”
and in that sentence he reminded the Landlords
of their futile slaughter of Murray’s Land Tax
Bill.
More Socialism ! More ruin ! This time it
is the Christchurch (M.L.) Municipal Council
which proposes to do the mischief. The town’s
public clocks used to call one another a liar every
minute of the day, and to stop that sort of local
disgrace they were all connected electrically with
a small controlling clock in the town clerk’s office.
This implement sends out the electric current that
moves the hands of the public timepieces. In this
way time all over the city is kept uniform. The
council now announces that it is prepared to con-
nect the system with any private house or place
of business, and already many people are applying
for the service. All that is required is a wire
from the council office and a clock dial to show
the time. There are no works to get out of order,
no winding, no trouble, no “few minutes slow ”
and consequent missed trains —no anything except
perfect order and a small annual bill.
Colonel Onslow jettisoned most of his
allegiance to the Wade Government, last week.
This is how the S. M. Herald describes his
attitude toward the Saturday Half-Holiday Bill :
The most astonishing break-away of the night was
when Colonel Onslow rose. He smote the measure hip
and thigh, as being an additional restriction of the
liberty of the subject— i.e., the shopkeeper; but, recog-
nising “the absurdity of opposing it against the com-
bined forces of the Government and the Opposition,” he
went no further than making his protest.
Onslow has met with scurvy treatment at the
hands of Liberalism. The party preferred Jessep to
him at last State elections. And of late it is said to
have intrigued against him in his own electorate,
so that he lias been defeated for the local selection.
Can the infuriated warrior be blamed for refusing
any more to support the Socialistic proposals of
the Government which exists to smash Socialism.
Barrister J. £>. Fitzgerald, one of the
members of the first Parliamentary Labor party
in N.S.W. and now up against little Levy for
Darlinghurst, turns the tables this way
The Wade Government is constantly crying out about
“ the enemies of Sydney.” But who are the enemies of
Sydney? He could tell them. They were those who had
had the power to make Sydney greater than it was and
did not use it; those whose neglect of Sydney problems
had handicapped the city to-day in.its commerce ; who
had refused to give to Sydney proper wharfage accommo-
dation by resuming the Gas Company’s premises ; who
had neglected to give a proper suburban and city railway
service, and a proper connection between the north and
south shores by tunnel or bridge ; who had seen the
beauty spots filched from the citizens one by one;,who
had done nothing for housing, nothing for improvement
of our choked commercial avenues, nothing for better
approaches to our wharves, nothing for beautification.
These were the enemies of Sydney—those who had the
power and would not use it; those who were unable to
grasp a great question ; who were incapable of realising
the fact that Sydney had grown to the proportions of
one of the world’s great cities, with the immediate pro-
spect of an enormous increase of growth. Sydney had
outgrown the capacity to handle its great and growing
commerce, and the Government had pigeon-holed the
improvement scheme drafted by its own Royal Commis-
sion, and had pigeon-holed Greater Sydney. '
FAIR EXCHANGE.
The Government is now considering a scheme of
superannuation, the details of which will be made
public in the course of a few days, under which the rail-
way and tramway servants of the State will find relief
which will guarantee them in their declining years
against having to seek refuge in a poorhouse or asylum.
—Premier Wade at Ashfield ( N.S.W. ).
Holland at last gives up Freetrade as a
bad job. As Germany’s great river, the Rhine,
ambles into the sea through Dutch territory the
country has much transit trade, and that kept it
hanging to the tail of the old superstition longer
than might otherwise have been' the case. Its
defection will leave Turkey almost the only Free-
trade (or partially Freetrade) country on the con-
tinent of Europe, and the miserable wearer of the
fez can hardly help himself. In times past his
benighted sovereigns bought peace or purchased
assistance by commercial concessions, till finally
it was agreed that Turkey should never, except
by permission of the Powers, charge more than 8
percent, duty on anything. The figure was ulti-
mately raised to 11 per cent, in order that the
Unspeakable might have a chance to find money
with which to pay his foreign interest bill; but
Turkey is still a low-tariff country with a gun
pointed at it.
AND THEY GAVE A STONE.
N.S.W. Premier Wade stated recently that his Cabinet had been too busy to give attention to the question
of granting aid to Lady Dudley’s bush-nursing scheme, but that, in any case, a concrete reminder of the late
King would be erected by the State. He was not sure whether the statue would be of the equestrian order or
otherwise.
“ But my poor patient requires immediate attention. What do you prescribe! ”
“A statoo , nurse. You can't beat a statoo!”
Bigjohn Forrest makes his complaint
anew in the House of Representatives
There is a lot of talk about borrowin’, a lot of talk
against the people who made the Great Country what it
is. I don’t like it. It is disparagin’; it is an insult to
MEN LIKE MYSELF !
The fact that Myself has ceased to attract any
notice worth mentioning is the constant sorrow
of the vain old Emperor’s life.
Japan, which had a fairly heavy tariff
aforetime, has lately increased it, and the tail of
the Monkey is greatly uplifted. The new move
is apparently directed with especial care against
Britain. On the things the Jap mostly buys from
Bull the duties have risen G 6 per cent, all round,
while on those which he mostly buys from Russia,
Germany, etc., the average increase is 50 per cent.
The duty on iron rails has been whooped up from
4s. 6d. to 275. 6d. per ton; on galvanised wire,
from Bs. lOd. to about 455., and many other taxes
.have whizzed skyward, almost out of sight. And
there are persistent rumors that when the Anglo-
Jap treaty runs out Japan will join the Triple
Alliance—Germany, Italy and Austria. Truly
there is little gratitude among the people of the
tree-tops,
In the House of Representatives last week
the Minister for Home Affairs promised to tackle
a well-known Tory League lady re the truth of
her allegation that “a man” had voted 15 times
for a Labor candidate at last Federal elections,
and that “aßiverina swagimin” had put in 27
votes for the same unholy cause. Considering
that a swagman who voted 27 times in thinly
peopled Rivenna would have to' run about 100
miles in a day the yarn looks improbable, but
a lady’s statement ought not to be inquired
into too closely. No right-thinking man,
much less a Minister for Home Affairs, should
bother a lady for proofs in support of her state-
ments. Her word is sufficient. The Bulletin,
in its mind’s eye, can clearly see that Riverina
voter, flying around to 27 scattered polling-places,
dropping an iniquitous Labor vote at every stage
of his mad proceedings.
Jusfc because the States won’t back up the
Commonwealth, and because the Commonwealth
hasn’t yet got the constitutional authority
to back itself up, Australia is consuming large
quantities of very cheap water with its
butter after paying for it as butter. In
Britain it isn’t legal to expose for:sale any butter
containing more than 16 per cent, of moisture;
and to prevent Australian butter being rejected
and given a bad name, the Commonwealth pro-
hibits the export of tat with more than that much
moisture in it. The result is that the butter
which is not passed because it couldn’t be put on
the English market is thrown on to the Australian
market; and the Commonwealth has not the
power to stop it and thus force the producers to
turn out a decent article. The States have the
power; but they are mostly too busy scratching
at the Commonwealth to use it.
During a recent scuffle between the Prime
Minister and a more or less holy deputation,
Parson Worrall complained that certain colored
missionaries from Fiji were put to inconvenience
under the laws for the restriction of alien immi-
grants, while Jack Johnson, the colored pugilist,
was “ received with open arms.” A hurried in-
vestigation of the records showed that Johnson
was required to find security that he would leave
within a certain time, while the colored mission-
aries were admitted on the mere assurance of a
religious society that they would depart in due
course. This is a postscript to the row :
Answering Mr. Bamford (Q.) in the House of Repre-
sentatives to-day, Mr. Batchelor said he had received
from Rev. Mr. Worrall a letter bearing upon his state-
ment as to theadmissioh of Jack Johnson to the Common-
wealth, in replv to a communication from the depart-
ment. THE LETTER CONTAINED NO APOLOGY, but
Mr. Batchelor took it to amount to a retraction of the
statement.
No, the letter contained no apology. After
accusing the Australian Government of favoring
the pugilist as against the missionary, and after
having it proved that the advantage was really
the other way about, a bookmaker or a hawker or
a scavenger might have expressed his sincere
regret. But the reverend gentleman offered no
apology.
The Victorian furniture trade isn’t a nice
thing to look at these days. The influx of the
Chow mystery continues, and no one seems to
know where he comes from. There is no question
about where he goes to, for he doesn’t go. In
1899 there were 488 Chinamen making cheap gitn-
crack furniture in Victoria. In 1900 the number
had danced up to 552 ; in 1901 to 574 ; in 1902 to
614 ; in 1905 to 708 ; and for the year 1908 it was
reported to be 734. A heavy excise duty on each
pint of furniture, with a rebate on the white-made
article, is looming in the near future.
BRITISH STEEL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
German makers have agreed to deliver steel plates to
Clyde shipbuilders at ss. fid. a ton under Scotch prices.—
Cable.
British hammers clanging, singing,
On the red-hot rivets ringing ;
In the Clyde-side dock yards bringing
Ships to berth upon the tide.
British built and British driven,
Through the dock yard gates they ride.
And the hammers tell a story
Of a nation’s pride and glory ;
Built up slowly from the keel—
“ British work and British workers 1 ”
Sing the hammers on the steel.
But her ancient glory’s dying ;
Empty forges are a-sighing,
For her dockyards all are buying
German steel from over-sea ;
German steel for British hammers,
Soon they’ll come from Germany.
And the hammers fall a-dirging
Of a nation that is verging—
On to madness truck and keel—
“ German steel and starving workers.”
Toll the hammers on the steel.

FREQUENT THROBBING HEADACHES.
u
There’s nianyacause.
Men are not often
troubled by head-
aches ; when they are
it is generally due to
biliousnesss or indi-
gestion. But women have head-
aches which seem peculiar to their
sex, frequent throbbing headaches.
Does it not seem that such head-
aches peculiar to women must be at
once related to womanly disease?
Women who suffer with diseases
peculiar to the sex do not realise
the drain of vital strength and nerve
force they undergo as a consequence
of disease. It is this that causes the
headaches of sick women.
In other cases these pains and dis-
agreeable feelings are generally
symptoms of some other complaint,
such as indigestion, biliousness and constipation,
all of which are caused by corrupt, noxious matter
clogging the circulations; hence a stream or rush
of blood to the head, and by the excitement a
great pressure on the brain. Giddiness, headache,
loss of memory, dimness of sight, and various
other complaints are the result. Thus it will be
seen that all the above painful and distressing
maladies owe their origin to the blood. Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are acknowledged to be
the only medicine that will thoroughly purify the
blood. They enter the stomach and unite with
the blood, and follow the stream of life on its
journey through the system. They root out all
foulness and impurity, and drive out every
unhealthy obstruction. They should be taken
every night in sufficient quantities to operate
freely, by commencing with two pills on going to
bed, three the next night, four the next; if the
symptoms are not removed, commence again with
two pills and go up again as before. Continue in
like manner until the blood is thoroughly purified,
and all pain and distress is entirely removed.*

SPORTING
NOTIONS
A N.S.W. Rugby League XIII. journeyed to
Bnsbane, and fell on the local Leaguers in great
Xhe local men were as willing as the invaders
and the result was a struggle which drove the crowd to
great excitement. Messenger opened the actual hostili-
ties by a place lock from near halfway; but the wind
blew the ball wide. Then New South came away with a
passing charge, which was carried over and gave
the Ma State first score. Messenger again failed at goal.
Queensland tried some passing charges in quick suc-
cession, and got across, but also failed to add the extras.
Having found that quick, short passing was a par-
able game, Queensland did it again, and once
more crossed. This time Brackenrigg booted the
ball over the bar, and Queensland led by eight to three,
then the struggle grew fast,and, in the rush, one Queens-
lander fell and was run over. Being carried off, his place
was taken by another fiend like unto himself, and the
pace increased, if anything, till Farnsworth, of N.S.W.,
bioke loose and swept down on a defenceless line with
only one man between him and a certain score. Broom-
ham was close behind and Farnsworth passed. Cann
kicked the goal and the scores were level. N.S.W. broke
through again and Mes-enger lifted the score to
lo in favor of the Ma State. The Cornstalk team
had got going, and went on at such a pace
that at half-time it led by 19 points to 11. The
second half the Walers found the sun in their faces, and
while they were cursing over this fact Queensland scored
a held goal, and followed up with a determined attack on
the line, which, after a great struggle, was stormed. So
the Banana score was lifted to 18, just one behind thatof
N.b.VV. The sun continued to worry the Walers, and so
did the Queenslanders, who scored another try but failed
to convert. This gave the northern team the lead bv 21 to
19. Messenger ran around addressing a few blistering
words to his men, who responded with a try and a goal, and
made the Ma State 24 to 21. Then the Wales team broke
loose, and Queensland, weakening, found itself thrown on
the defensive. Queensland was done and the triumphant
Walers went on scoring till at the whistle they had
made their record 40 to 21. The trouble with Queensland
w'as that, when hard pressed, the lack of experience at the
League game got the men down. There was no time to
think what to do, and ignorance prevented them doing
the right thing by intuition. When they have learned
some more they will be a formidable lot.
* * * *
In Sydney the Football League pursued the
even tenor of its , competitions. The surprise of
the day was the smashing of the formidable Glebe by
Annandale, the baby club, which ran out with 10 points
to Glebe’s seven. Western Suburbs got another hiding,
this time from Balmain, which notched 13 points
to 10. An awful walloping was that inflicted
upon North Sydney by the strong-legged men
from South Sydney. From the very start South
jumped incessantly on the struggling North, and,
when the whistle blew, it had jumped 53 points to
four. Most interest was centred on the struggle be-
tween Eastern Suburbs and Newtown. East having
many men away was reckoned certain for a bad defeat.
But these things are on the knees of the gods, and
though Newtown almost burst its boiler and its collar in'
its frantic struggles to break through, Eastern Suburbs
notched point for point, and the game ended in a draw
with four points all.
So Newtown is still ahead in the competition
with 15 points. South Sydney is second with 14. Bal-
main and Eastern Suburbs are third and fourth with 12
and 11 points each. A feature is that although New-
town is in front it has scored only 150 points to 51,
whereas South Sydney has mopped up 251 to 82.
Newtown is also leading in the Union competi-
tion with 16 points, and South Sydney is second in this
department likewise, but with only 12points ; moreover,
it shares the second line with University, Eastern Suburbs
and Glebe. Manly and Western Suburbs have eight
each. There are others, but mercy forbids that
their weakness should be exposed. On Saturday
South Sydney went under to University, the stud-
ents scoring 18 to South’s eight. Manly’s recent
triumphal progress was checked, Eastern Suburbs
downing the Village by nine points to three. Glebe
met St. George and knocked seven dragons out of it
winning by 23 points to nine. The horrible goal kicking
of St. George was a sight that harrowed up the soul, and
a failing that made victory an impossibility. St. George
team should either get married or-buy a couple of dogs
for each man. Western Suburbs nearly died of shock
when it discovered it had smashed up Balmain by 16 to
11. But the prize horror was the decline and'fall of
Sydney, when Newtown dartced on the prostrate city to'
the tune of 32 points' to-nil.
* * *
In the Sydney Soccer division things are grow-
ing exciting. For the Rawson Cup Glebe is leading,
with 14 competition points, followed by Rozelle witli 13
and Balmain with 11. For the Association Cup, Ultimo
is in the van with 17 points, while Western Suburbs,
Prometheus and St. George are behind in that order,
with 15, 14 and 12 points respectively. The coveted
Gardiner Cup is now in the semi-final stage, and the dis-
putants are Ultimo, Powerful, Rozelle and Helensburgh.
So things Soccer are humming.

Although English Rugby may be decadent, the
real English game, which is Soccer, is verv virile. On
Saturday last, the English team that has been raiding
South Africa played its third test match at Capetown,
and wiped the floor with the hardy Afrikanders by six
goals to three. This was the third test of the tour,' and
England has come out on top every time. The first was
played at Durban, and the Rooineks won by three to nil.
The second was at Johannesburg, and the English scored
by six to two. The final match at Capetown completed
the tour.
* * * *
An army of “ Brokers” (from Broken Hill) in-
vaded Sydney last week, and played Australian foot-
ball at Erskineville Oval against a team which was
labelled “ New South Wales.” As a matter of fact, the
best players in the metropolis were in the stand, looking
on. Why this was the case only the selectors know, and
as the team they chose won, no remarkscan he passed on
their choosing. They were told to pick a team lodown
Broken Hill, and did it. Thinking the team was short, the
selectors asked sundry, players who had not been picked
to change their togs and stand by ready to join in the
fray ; and then informed them they were not required.
Under the watchful eye of Captain Mick Grave the home
team made a great fight and just managed to beat the
Brokers on the post and win bj’ three points. Grave’s
leadership was a humorous item ; the old man stood out-
side the pickets and howled his orders to the team
which obeyed implicitly. Cooper, the alleged captain,
was a mere lay figure.
* * * *
This English Northern Union team seems to
have got itself thoroughly disliked. It was referred to in
Sydney as the “worst tempered team” that ever left
England. In Maoriland things were strenuous from the
jump and the four matches played in the Hocking Isles
were all marred by rough play and a tendency to upper*
cut. According to the papers the Maorilanders did not
retaliate, or there would have been a free fight in every
match. From a toe-bull p .int of view the English were
very successful, scoring 187 points to 47—which is about
the worst downfall Maoriland has ever struck. Judging
by the attendances at two matches (17,000 and 10,000),
the League game has caughton in W rd’s Dominion. By
the time this is in print the Englishmen will lie back in
Sydney, unless the YVaratah act is repeated, having left
Auckland on the night of Monday last.
Al though the tour of N.S. W. this season by the
Maori Rugby (Union) team resulted in considerable
financial loss, the wealthy natives who footed the bill, as
distinct from those who booted the ball, reckon it was
worth the money for the sake of the educational advant-
ages to the young men of the tribes. Hori doesn’t mind
P'.ving for education, particularly if it can be found in
the vicinity of a racecourse, a billiard-table or a football
field ; and he is busy thinking out some more tours of
the kind. At present, proposals are being considered for
a visit to Britain in 1911.
In the Yiecorian Football Ass., Town and P’ran
are scrambling for fourth place, while’Scray nd Port
are lamenting the odd game they lost earlier in the
season when they didn’t think it counted ; consequently
only two games held any importance in the scheme of
things. Jf P’ran could defeat the North it might lie
back well pleased with itself. But it couldn’t. In fact,
it hadn’t Buckley’s. The undefeated, semi-League crowd
went ahead from the bounce and stayed there, with a
final tally of 52 points to P’ran's 29. The other episode of
moment was that between 'Town and Port, in which the
former took no chances, and landed a winner, with 64
points to 42. The other clubs spent the aftprnnon in
kicking the air bag about to li tle purpose. Offieial re-
cords : Essendon’s 106 to Brighton’s 38 ; Brunswick’s 118
to Northcote’s 43 ; and ’Scray’s 127 to Preston’s 20. This
last catastrophe so annoyed the Preston ’bailers that they
resorted to what Judkins would call “degrading
methods,” whereupon ’Scrap’s barraekers stepped in and
“ mixed it" willingly, being only induced to cease hos-
tilities by the application of police batons.
* * * fe
One of the inscrutable laws of Providence fre-
quently ordains, as the Rev. Mr. Mudkins would put it,
that the game that is expected to provide Melbourne
with an exhibition of strenuous and well-directed en-
deavor turns out instead to be a mere untidy spell of
bogging-in and flopping round. This was the disaster
that struck the 25,000 who squeezed into the East. Mel-
bourne ground on Saturday to view the collision • f South
and 'Varsity. Both teams are struggling to be in the
final four; and as the two eighteens consisted of large,
muscular men, the spectators promised themselves joy.
Bur there was no joy. After the first quarter Skinner’s
hirelings had it all their own way, and ran out. easy win-
ners by 67 points to 24. Across the Yarra Park Rich-
mond was doing a mighty but useless dash against Gee-
long. The former has no chances of semi-final honors, but
the latter has ; wherefore the know-alls opined the game
would be “crook.” The point is that Geelong’s victory
meant the probable “ outing ” of South, which Richmond
lovpth not. As usual, the know-alls were know-nothings.
Only Richmond’s disorderly kicking gave Geelong a
chance; hut it grabbed that chance with both hands,
and brought the score level—six goals six behinds to
Richmond’s five goals 12 behinds, which, being inter-
preted, is 42 points all. There was no earthly reason why
anyone should have spent the afternoon inspecting the
Carlton v. ’Roy unpleasantness, inasmuch as the posi-
tions of both are assured —one at the top, the other near
the bottom. Carlton, whose kicking was wretched, got
an undeserved win hy three points. On the Metropolitan
Ground ’Wood passed its opponents the time of day and
a handy walloping by 66 points to 48 ; while Essendon
deposited the Saints in their accustomed place, 77 points
to 38 being the official statement.

The Maoriland Rugby team that went to the
United States recently had a curious reception. There
were 25 players, and they were accompanied by about the
same number of relatives and enthusiasts, their wives and
daughters. When they steamed in on the Mariposa the
haughty Yankee officials refused to allow them to land,
and talked of deportation till the British Consul took a
hand. Then the Yankees discovered that what they
thought was trachoma was merely the Maori eyelid. In
California, the home of western football, no team was
found that had the pluck to take on the Maoris, who
looked most formidable. So the men went on
tour, vainly seeking victims. To keep the pot
boiling they appeared in the music-halls; and
with their tattooed hakas, fantastic war
scenes and native singing became the rage. Then
on to New York, which was apparently taken by
storm. Whilst they were in New York the Gothamites
got together a terrible team that was reckoned good
enough to'eat anything on ea'rth. and invited the Maoris
to come out and be chawed up. The Maoris came, and
before their machine-like passing, fleetness of foot and
great weight the Yankees were crumpled up by 24 points
to three. America stood still. Till they got back to
California no Rugby club would risk such a dog-walloping
as the Maoris appeared able to inflict. There America’s last
hope played them before an enormous crowd. The Maoris
soon found they were playing the referee as well as ihe
team, and that he was equal to two teams in his
own person. Ends were changed without any score.
The Californian team, which was composed' mostly
of transplanted Britons, got its tail up, ini- j
proved immensely and scored a try by grace
of the referpe. The Maoris protested univail-
ingly. Another was obtained shortly afterwards,
and the Yanks began to show signs of insanity. ; The
Maoris declared hoth tries (which were unconverted) to
have been illegally given, and rather than submit the
Maori cap ain led his men off the field. Persuaded to
return, the Maoris regretted their weakness, as the fouls
and crooked refereeing continued to the end and they
were beat"n. The Maori regard for the Sabbath broke
the Yankees up. and their refusal to perform in the music
halls on Sundays caused much blasphemy. The jteam
leaves for home on August 7.

If the Australian Statistician would keep a
special and separate tally for a year of the accidents that
happen on the racecourses of the Commonwealth, the
record would throw an interesting light on the question
of dangerous and brutal sport. At Moorefield (Sydney),
on Saturday, there w'as a smash in which four horses fell.’
One had to be destroyed, and the four jockeys w-ere sent
to hospital. Although the injuries are said to be slight,
one of the boys has a damaged spine and all are suffering
from shock. The worst feature of the case is that the
smash is said to have resulted from the foul tactics of
someone unspecified. This sort of miscreant should he
rooted out with great thoroughness. His tvpe is too
numerous in racingoircles. Boxing, football and therest
of the sports are safe compared with racing. The onlv
enjoyments that appear to be near the same level are
burglary and cockfighting.

During the 11 years between 1890 and 1910, no
less than £16,521,521 passed through the Maoriland tote,
which is equal to £1,501.956 per annum. What went
through the bookmakers’ bags is not checked, except by
the remorseful losers, and only the-Ring and its father,
whose name is never mentioned in polite society, have
any idea. All the man in the street knows is that it is an
enormous sum, This Writer is not in any way inclined to
be a Primitive Unitarian, but these figures grieve him.
To think of Maorilanders spending all that money and
never having a decent flutter for it is pathetic. Gambling
is a futile thing unless there is a chance of making a
competence at one stroke. Only a small soul is content
to gamble for 15. One can always gauge the character
of a man by his gambles. The humdrum individual,
intended to be a splitter of wood and a dragger of water
all his days, gambles at the most for half a week’s wages.
Men in whom reposes, deep down perhaps, the potential-
ities of greatness gamble for larger sums or bigger prizes.
In fact, the p issible really great man never gambles on a
racecourse; he can find greater excitement in other
flutters for prizes that may affect the whole of his future
career. If he should stoop to gamble on horses- which is,
after all, a tame business compared with founding a new
religion or building a new terrace of wild cats—then he
goes in heavily and plays for a fortune. If Maoriland
must spend £1.500,000 annually, why on e rth doesn’t it
get a d-cent gamble for its money in the shape of a huge
quarterly consultation with £400,000 to divide up
between the State (as promoter) and the winners. Four
hundred thous ndquid!!! That would mean at least
half a dozen solid fortunes going quarterly !

The Australian Hurdle Race, due at Caulfield
next Saturday, looks a pretty good thing for the Penance
horse, King's ltansom, who is asked to carry on!y9st. 131 b.
With the same weight up, King’s Ran»om won the Cup
Hurdl over three miles at Flemington last November,
and at last Grand National meeting he ran third to Obi
in the DomtaGalla Hurdle. Over the easier Caulfield
jumps, King’s Ransom gave one clumsy exhibition,
when, probably, out of sorts ; but there is no denying
that the horse can jump, and has been improving with
every gallop of late. Last week he won a jumpers’ flat
race at Sandown (Melb.) in good style, and, in the words
of Anderson’s melodrama, his show for next Saturday’s
long race is the chance of a lifetime.

The stake money in S. Ans. went mostly to
ocal owners during the- past vear. Victorian visitors
failed in their Cup-hunting in Adelaide. R. M. Hanker,
who buys high-priced youngsters all over Australia,
won £2560. Only two others, J. James and A. P. Bow-
man, went over uIOOO, but nearly 50 won £250 or more.
Lots of Adelaide doctors, lawyers, and such like own a
horse or two just for the love of the game, and the cer-
tainty of totalisator receipts enables the clubs to cut
entrance-fees low ; so a small stake occasionally pays
expenses. Howie, McCann and J. James were the most
successful tr dners ; Marshall Liddle and Campbell the
leading jockeys ; Pistol, To-tig and Malster the sires on
top of the list. The figures sweep in Broken Hill, where
the racing is done mostly by S. Aus. horses.

Gordon Inglis : A. F. Wilding, the M.L.
crack, had by no means a smooth passage to the final of
the tennis championship at Wimbledon (England) on
June 30. He had to defeat in turn Roper Barrett, M. J.
G. Ritchie, J. C. Parke and Otto Froitzheiin. In his
match with Beals Wright he succeeded in wiping out the
Davis Cup singles of 1908, thus gaining the right to meet
A. W. Gore in the Challenge round. This was played
alternately in sunshine, gloom and rain—the English
climate had a day out. Gore made a great attempt
to retain his title, and, considering he is 17 years
older than Wilding and was winning matches before
the latter was born, the fight he put up ought to
stand to his credit when some of his victories are for-
gotten. Wilding’s game shows a material advance. His
service and forehand drive retain their old terrors, while
his backhand and overhead work have greatly improved.
Australasian players have done their share towards swell-
ing the Wimbledon banking account. Norman Brookes
drew large crowds in his triumphal 1907 meeting, and at
the last meetings of Wilding with Wright and Gore over
5000 people paid their money at the gates.

The Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron is not
going to be allowed to sleep on the Sa.vonara Cup. The
Victorian Royal Yacht Club asked and received an ex-
tension of time for a challenge for next snuner. In the
meantime it cabled Mr. Dixon, owner of the Sayonara,
asking him if he intended to carry out his threat to build
a 12-metre yacht to challenge for the Cup. At time of
writing no reply had been received from Mr. Dixon. The
Brighton Yacht Club, the register of which includes all
the crack boats on Port Phillip, has also asked the
R.Y.S. if a challenge will be accepted from it; though
what yacht it can put up with anv chance of success
against the slippery-heeled Culwu’lla 111. is hard to
think of.

The irritating thing about aviation is the
sudden irruption of the unknown performer. Every
now and again it is announced that a man named Smith
or Brown has flown 400 miles over mountain, city and
plain, or done some other amazing feat. And then
Smith, or whatever'his name is, just drops out of view,
and the show aviator is worried and haunted by a feel-
ing that somewhere, lying low, is a man who is a past
master at the game. Some timeago a man whose name
was not even mentioned built an aproplane in his back-
yard, fitted it with an engine, hauled it out by hand and
started right across the United States, landed at his des-
tination, and vanished once more into private life. Now
it is cabled that two Lombards, no names mentioned,
have bi-planed to the summit of the Trois Seigneurs,
7750 ft. high, in the Alps. Whether they came back from
the topmost peak of the Three Bosses is not explained.
It is all vervirritating.

Seems that Robl, the ex-pace follower who was
killed aviating a few weeks back, lost his life through
the insistence of the crowd which had paid for admission.
Bad weather set in and the flyers went on strike. But
the crowd growing nasty, Robl offered to make a flight.
He did so, and at 250 ft. altitude he was blown over. His
machine crashed to the ground among the spectators,
but unfortunately did not kill one or two of the worst
specimens. Robl was quite unrecognisable, and was, of
course, killed instantlv.

Professional cyclist Fred Alpin is well-nigh
the speediest pedaller at present to be found in the ranks
of the N.S.W. League of Wheelmen. Previous to Satur-
day, the best effort over 10 miles- on the road stood at
24min., but Alpin put up new figures for the distance
by getting over the stretch in 23min. 27 1-5 sec. It was a
sterling effort, and likely to withstand many onslaughts.

Sydney baseball premiership struggle is drawing-
near the end, after the liveliest season on record. The
result is a good thing for Burwood, which club, by
winning 12 out of 13 matches, accumulated 25 points.
North Sydney was next on 15 points, the other eight
clubs not being in the hunt. OnSaturday.gr de matches
will rest while the Melbourne club assaults Burwood at
Sydney Cricket Ground.

Present appearances are that the Board of Con-
trol will, as a matter of principle, refuse the offer of the
Sydney Sun to indemnify it to the extent of £5OOO for the
African ciicket tour. In that case the Sun will commu-
nicate directly with the cautious Afrikanders and offer
them the guarantee, and then the Afrikanders will, of
course, pack < heir gripsacks and start for the land of the
Kangaroo right away.

Overlander Francis Birtles, who left Sydney a
few months ago to traverse Australia on a bicycle, has
pedalled out of the hush at Turkey Creek, way up in the
northern section of Westrilia. A battle with blacks
varied the monotony of the exercise, and helped to ki-ep
him from emul iting Johnson, who sat on a crocodile in
the Northern Territory. Birtles is mounted on one of
Anthony Horderns’ Universal bicycles—the same machine
which carried him across Australia on a previous journey.
_ The Five Miles Cross Country Championship of
N.S. W. was quite an important function this year, inas-
much as it attracted more public attention than usual.
East Brisbane Harriers Club sent a team to Sydney for the
occasion, but some of the young' men were not gifted
with that reserve and self-control that makes for perfec-
tion in athletics. They impaired their wind by howling
like dingoes at night in the cold air on the balconies of
the hash-tower which had the misfortune to accommo-
date them. The other competitors w ere Botany, South
Sydney, East Sydney, Redfern and Newtown Harriers.
The course was chiefly round the Victoria Park race-
course, with a stretch across the horrible country that
surrounds that delightful oasis in the wilderness of Zet-
land. Ivan Coxon, of South Sydney, made the pace twice
round the course and led the field out of the gate
and away towards Rosebery Park. But he blew out at
the first sandhill, and Fitzsimmons, his club-mate, took
charge for a time. On the run back from Rosebery Park
Wevman, of Botany, led the way over the horrible, heart-
wrecking sandhills, and looked a certain winner right on
to the racecourse. It was when rounding the bend into
the straight that Temple Wood, of East Sydney club,
came with a mighty rush and, passing Wevman, got
home 15yds. to the good. But that represented merely
the individual placing. When the points were dealt out
it was found that Botany Harriers had won with a margin
of seven points from South Sydney, which was followed
by East Sydney, with 49 more points debited against it.
The others trooped in in the following order: East
Sydney, East Brisbane (the howlers on the balcony), Red-
fern and Newtown.

The billiard match between old man John
Roberts and young Fred Lindrum (18,000 up, with Lin-
drum receiving 3000 start), at Billiards Ltd., Sydney, was
a mighty struggle which lasted a whole fortnight. In
the early part of the match Roberts held the advantage ;
hut youth asserted itself, and half-way through Lindrum
led by 1802 points—3o2 points ahead of the sessional
average. The battle during last week was brilliant, and
though, at times, Roberts spurted (particularly in one
break of 500 in 35min.), Lindrum’s consistency stood to
him, and he ran to the 18,000 mark when Roberts was
anchored at 15,693—a clear advantage of 2307 points.
Roberts only gained 693 points in the long tussle, and,
after Lindrum’s showing in the matches at Melbourne
and Sydney, the old man should climb down off his tall
steed and give the Australian champion a level event.
The highest breaks in the match were 500, 414, and 49
other efforts over 100, by Roberts; while Lindrum’s best
were 391 (twice) and 45 other scores over the century.
* * * *
The advent of John Roberts is bringing a boom
in billiards. In the coming week, the veteran will
attempt to concede Fred Weiss 2000 in 12,000 at Sydney ;
after which matches with Lindrum, Weiss, and possibly
Englishman A. E. Williams at Melbourne, will be pro-
ceeded with. Lindrum and Weiss will also battle for the
Australasian championship; and when these matches
have blown themselves out, all four shining lights are
billed to rush off to England in search of gold and glory.
“Snell ” : I feel there’s an enormous scope for
disagreement with “ 0.K.” in his lengthy animadversion
on the pug industry (B. 21/7/’I0). He scorns pugilism,
and rejoices, as a white man, that stoushing has finally
been branded a black man’s game, because fist fighting is
a miserable human imitation of a business in which the
brutes excel. In support of this view he instances the
fact that, as a puncher, man is a wretched failure when
compared with the lion or the tiger. Does “0.K.” make
nothing of the casual circumstance that Beaurepaire is a
despicable amphibian compared with a seal, and would be
donkey-licked by a barracouta in a 100 yd. sprint?
Furthermore, Postle can’t run for nuts as com-
pared with an antelope, and George Blake’s five-
mile record has been beaten by 9000 ostriches and
motor-cars. Because of this deplorable human incom-
petence must swimming as a sport be abandoned to cod,
pedestrianism be given over to springbok, and high-
jumping be forsaken as a pathetic compliment to the
superiority of the ’roo? The low types “ 0.K.” finds at a
fight are those he may discover at a race meeting or a
football match. They are not ring products to any
extent. If one sport is more responsible than another
fo'- their degradation, it is horse racing—a business that
deliberately cultivates physical deterioration in the
humans who take active part in it. Johnson’s triumph
at Reno is a slap for the white, since it represents the
superiority of the coon in a sphere in which hundreds of
thousands of fine young palefaces are striving to excel.
If it is nothing for the white to be inferior in courage
and strength and coolness and skill, the negro’s success
is of no consequence ; but meanwhile “ 0.K.” does not
alter the case by calling those virtues hard names.

Stevenson would probably have got the decision
in his wrestling bout with Shima at Broken Hill had he
not lost his temper. He had the first and fourth falls to
his credit and was going strong, while the Jap was about
worn out through securing the second and fifth. In the
sixth, the deciding bout, Shima’s head bashed Stevenson
heavily, and the white man appealed for a foul. It was
disallowed, whereupon the professor is reported to have
seized the Jap by the paw and banged him heartily, and
the referee gave the Jap the verdict on a foul.
“ The Passing of the Third Floor Back ” is said to have
been translated into Russian for a St. Petersburg
manager. The supernaturalism of the Stranger will pre-
sumably be emphasised by some extra limelight effects
in Russia, unless the censor prohibits the play as a
socialistic sermon in disguise. It raises a question as to
what would happen if the Stranger came and lodged with
the Czar.

Warrnambool (Vic.) is taking its coat off
and preparing to bog into the business of re-
discovering an alleged Spanish galleon that is
vaguely reputed to lie somewhere six miles NW.
of the village. The wrecked vessel was first seen
by Port Fairy sealers in ’36, and in 46 Captain
Mason, of Belfast, saw “the hull of a vessel high
and dry in the hummocks, far above the reach of
the tide. It appeared to have been of about 100
tons burden, and must, from its appearance and
position, have been there very many years. The
timber composing it was either mahogany
or cedar.” The local aborigines, when ques-
tioned, averred it “was always there.” It was
last seen in 1880, but nobody appears to have ever
taken exact bearings, and since then shifting
sands have covered up the derelict, and now no-
body knows just where to look for it. Nobody
knows, either, whether it will be worth tuppence if
it is found. But the “ Wake up, Warrnambool,”
cry has got hold of the inhabitants, and they are
going to try to dig up the remains—before going
to sleep again.
Contrary to what might be expected of it,
South Aus. isn’t by any means such a Bible-buyer
as some of the other States. Of course, the
British and Foreign Bible Society doesn’t do all
the trade in the good book, but it does a good
deal of it. And according to agent Kennedy, now
in Melbourne endeavoring to raiste £lO,OOO for
a Bible House—whatever sort of an emporium
that may be—the Ma State last year took 21,600
Bibles; Victoria, 16,400; S. Aus., 1600; Tas-
mania, 1000; and Queensland, 12,000. Appa-
rently Bananaland is preparing to turn over a
new leaf, and will presently quit borrowing, throw
out Phidston, and tread the narrow track in real
earnest. But the S. Aus. figures seem discrepant
whichever way you look at them. Possibly the
citizens hand the volume down from father to
son, and, being already well supplied, need buy
few more; or possibly they know the Scriptures
by heart, and. being thrifty,,save the money to
put on the tote ; or, again, they may be wearing a
false reputation for godliness, and don’t really
indulge in .the Word at all.

VIEW OF CAIRNS,
MR. DONALD McDONALD (the well-known writer)
describes the trip as follows: —
«t- **OR the greater part of the journey on the Queensland coast the steamer runs
r“* between the Great Barrier Reef and the mainland, making it one of the smoothest
of the sea trips of Australasia. The route is dotted with picturesque islands,
covered with foliage strange to southern eyes, and the boat is ever rounding headlands,
steaming into fine bays and estuaries. The famous Whitsunday Passage, between Mackay
and Bowen, is extremely picturesque.
“ In a short railway ride of 20 miles from Cairns one may travel through some of the
finest scenery in Australasia, culminating in the magnificent Barron Falls—the king of
cataracts. The trains run most of the way along the Barron Gorge, in scenery wild and
majestic, and the trip is one which no tourist going northwards should miss. I have ridden
on the box seat of a coach through the famous Bullerand Otira Gorges of New Zealand, and
looked practically down into eternity, with only a solid foot of roadway intervening; but it
is not more thrilling than this railway run through the Barron Gorge, where there is always
a comforting feeling that your lease of life is not terminable by a false step on the part of
one of the leading horses. The trains stops at the Falls, of which there is a superb view.
There is no necessity to rhapsodise—go and see it.”
CAIRNS
is picturesquely situated, has a healthy climate, and the temperature in
winter seldom falls below 50°. First-class hotel accommodation at Cairns
and Kuranda (Barron Falls) can be obtained at a reasonable tariff, and
the fishing at Cairns is excellent. A trip to the Barron Falls and gorgeous
scenery about that part of North Queensland should not be missed.

Chest com-
plaints can be cured
by SCOTT’S
Emulsion
Chest trouble, acute or
chronic, is cured by taking
Scott’s Emulsion. Scott’s
Emulsion permanently cures
chest trouble. This statement
is made because hundreds of
people have written to say
they were cured of chest
troubles by Scott’s Emul-
sion. For example, Mrs. Ada
Ward wrote, 12th February,
1909, from 61* Morehead
Street, Redfern, Sydney,
N.S.W.:
An attack of measles and bronchitis left-
my daughter with a severe chest cold. I tried
ĥ
many preparations, but noth-
ing did any good until I gave
Scott’s Emulsion, After the
first bottle she ceased to cough
up blood and phlegm, and
soon she was completely cured,
and is now a fine healthy girl.
This trademark was on the
emulsion I bought. ”
If you wish to get rid of your
chest trouble, and decide to
buy Scott’s Emulsion, de-
cide also to GET SCOTT’S
EMULSION. You may be
asked to buy another emul-
sion and told it is “just as
good as Scott’s.” Substitute
emulsions can only be sold
on the reputation of Scott’s
Emulsion.
Scott's Emulsion cures the disease-
no matter the age of the patient—and
will be approved by your Doctor for
Chest Trouble if you ask him.

“Camera” : How futile are the disparagements of pic-
ture shows which professing “sufferers” put into smart
paragraph form! The filmophobiacs are guilty of the
wildest tarradiddles. They gravely assert that the picture
business is “ dead ” in places where it is most alive and
booming, or they flippantly suggest that its regular
patrons will soon be surfeited. The filmophobiacs, seem-
ingly, are unemployed mummers and their admiring
sympathisers, pub-keepers and their faithful apostles,
and people whose notions of popular taste in entertain-
ment are formed at Riekards’s. Speaking as one who has
known the picture business from its feeble flicker infancy
to its present lusty youth, and who merely looks in occa-
sionally to see how it is getting on, I would say that its
popularity is assured. The “comic” pictures are less
puerile and less frequent than of old, the dramas
are stronger in design, the educational subjects
more interesting, the spectacular-fact pieces better
arranged, and the all round production of the photo-
graphs is wonderfully improved. Then there is the
orchestral accompaniment, which, with some pictures,
is half the effect. The King’s funeral passing silently
across the screen whilst a well-knit orchestra plays
selections from the classic dead marches, is more im-
pressive than the original show could have been.
Pictures are the weekly entertainment of more people
than go regularly to the theatres, whilst their occasional
visitors grow' more numerous every month. Statistics
show it, and the pictures themselves explain the fact.
Why, the cinematograph is but just beginning to realise
its possibilities, and the prosperous managements are
only young students of their business.
Two true stories of small Paris theatres. One of them
was doing poor business with a rotten show but a charm-
ing leading lady. So the management advertised:
“ Pretty and well-known actress wishes to meet gentle-
TOM WALLS,
“Arcadian” Jockey.
man with a view
to the above.
Letters only.”
Every inquirer—
and there were
swarms of them
—r ecei v e d a
photo, and an
appointment to
meet (at the
theatre), and
business boomed.
The other dodge
was more subtle.
A small house
was rehearsing
diligently for a
much-advertised
play, “Banco.”
The first night
was postponed,
and special at-
tention was given
to “Act 2;
scene—a gamb-
ling saloon.”
The police began
to ask questions,
and were told it
was most im-
portant to get
the by-play and
facial expression
of the gamblers
correctly. At the
end of a month
the cop force of
Paris got tired,
and raided the
place. It found
the gambling
scene going
strong, but none
of the plaj’ers
were known as
agtors, and the dratna called “Banco” doesn’t seem to
have ever been written.
“Lud”: The first electric light seen in London was
when Manager Hollingshed flashed a searcher from the
Gaiety Theatre roof, in 1869. There was a public outcry
that it was a disgraceful thim;, scaring horses, etc. In
1878 he used electric light for his theatre front. About
that time Professor Erasmus Wilson said the first and last
of the electric light were seen at the Paris Exhibition.
It will be remembered how this light was scoffed at in
meetings of the Sydney and Melbourne gas companies.
“Wang”: I enthusiastically back up “Bloggs’s” re-
marks concerning the “ standing room only ” notice out-
side theatres ; but I wish to add that, when a manager is
hauled before the beak for overcrowding his show, he
should simultaneously be arraigned for fraud. lam not
so fortunate as “ Bloggs ” in the matter of a seat ; mine
is in the upper circle, and I pay an extra bob for the early
door. When you are on this lurk you get inside about
7.30 p.m., and secure a comfortable seat until a creature
with hands the size of frying-pans comes along,
flops them on your shoulders and says, “Move up,
please.” It is no use protesting. Frying-pan raises
a row, and the major-domo or chief steward or
somebody comes along and tells you to get a
move on streetwards if you don’t like it. No
mention is made of the two bob being returned.
Choking with the desire to murder the frying-pan man
and assassinate the janitor, you make room, and, just
about then, the late doors, at a bob a time, surge in. Half
a dozen more frying-pan men shove, push, propel and
grip your neck, and bang you against your neighbor, and
stand on vour girl’s knee until the curtain rises,
when your final objection is cut off by a thousand or so
voices hissing, “Shut up!" By this time your clothes are
dirty, your ear bulged, your temper torn in 10 places,
and not all the platitudes of the hero or the outraged
palpitations of the heroihe’s 14 x 7 bosom can take the
kink out of your neck.
“E.”: The advertisement curtain at Melbourne Royal
is but a mild outrage compared with the booklet or
encyclopaedia issued as a playbill. The programme, ex-
clusive of its wrapper, is a 16-page publication, wherein
the information that people look'for is scattered ip frag-
ments. A portion of the first page is devoted to a state-
ment of the show ; then, after an interval of six irrelevant
pages, comes a bit of the cast of characters. This is
continued, with particulars re scenery, etc., on six sub-
sequent pages—a small allotment on each page—and all
the rest of the space is given to trade advts., relieved by
occasional portraits and streaks of theatrical matter. As
a commercial speculation the programme is doubtless
satisfactory to the persons who buy space in it, but as a
book of reference for the theatreaudienceitis as trouble-
some as a railway time-table. Programmes of old existed
to tell you about the show. Now they exist to urge you
to drink somebody’s corset or wear somebody’s tight
whiskj\
The twice-nightly theatre is spreading widely in
England, particularly in crowded centres. It fetches in
the many who can get out at seven, after tea, and who
want to be home again by about nine ; also, the many
more who are in shops that close at eight, and can do
with an evening’s fun that runs from nine to 11. The
performers are probably not paid much more than for a
single show, and admission prices can of course be cut
low. The programme is Variety mostly—but not always.
Plays as solid as “ Caste ” are now being sprinted through
twice in the four hours.
“ The Undersigned ”: Attended Melbourne Royal the
other night to see “The Merry Wives of Windsor.”
Chance led me to a seat behind a couple who seemed to
make hard work of it following the play. During an act
or so they spoke scornfully of the piece and the actors,
the lady audibly declaring that it was all tomfoolery and
the gentleman scoffing at large. In the middle of the
second act the lady suggested leaving, but the male said
he would chance it a little longer just to see the waltz.
His neighbor, scentingan opportunity to shunt the pair,
politely intimated that the only dancing in the play was
at the end, and that in any case there was no waltz.
“ What,” said the male nuisance, “don’t Asche and Miss
Clayton dance the Merry Widow waltz in this?” He
was assured that that was in another play altogether.
That decided them, and in a hurried whisper they agreed
to ro across to Rickards’s, where they could get some-
thing sensible for theit; money. As the lady threw on
her Chantecler headgear and jabbed in a hatpin, she
was understood to mutter, through the two others held
in her mouth, her complete dissatisfaction at the de-
liberate dishonesty of some theatrical people in attaching
misleading names to their plays for the purpose of
snaring the coin of folk who were out in search of in-
tellectual food.

Sydney, 13th July, 1910.
We hereby certify that we have examined the bills, compared the balances, and counted the coin
in the Head Ciffice of The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, Limited, and have compared
the returns of the Branches, and have found the same as specified in the foregoing Balance-Sheet.
W. L. DOCKER, {.
E. S. CAPE, »
Auditohs.
The following resolutions were curried unanimously :
“That the Report and Statements of Account be received and adopted, and ordered to be circu-
lated among the Proprietors.”
“That the Honorable Henry Moses, M.L.C., be re-elected a Director of the Bank.”
“That E. S. Cape, Esq., and F. W. Hixson, Esq., be appointed Auditors for the ensuing year.”
“ That the thanks of the Shareholders be presented to the Directors, General Manager, and
Officers of the Bank for their very satisfactory management of the affairs of the institution.”
T. A. DIBBS, General Manager.
In moving the adoption of the Report and Statements of Account, the Chairman, Mr. George J.
Cohen, said :
I am pleased to say that the Directors are able to-day to present to you a very strong and satis-
factory Balance-Sheet for the half-year just ended, and one that shows a marked expansion in the
Bank’s business. /
In comparing it with that of the corresponding period of last year it will be seen that the total
figures have increased over two and one-half millions in the twelve months. Looking at the debit side
you will notice the Reserve Fund has been increased by £BO,OOO ; in the same period Notes in Circu-
lation and Bills in Circulation, items which fluctuate with the requirements of the public, have
together increased £107,000, the main increase being a trifle under £2,350,000 in Deposits and other
Liabilities. *
Turning to the other side you will find our liquid assets have been increased by £2.338.000, to a
total of £10,870,000, equfil, I might add, to about fifty-five per cent, of our total liabilities to the
jjuuny.
This total is made up of increases in our Gold and Bullion in round figures of £1,660,000 ; money
at short call, £194,000 ; additional investments in Government,.Securities, £379,000 ; Bills Receivable
in London, etc., and Notes and Bills of other Banks. £169,00(1
Bills Discounted and all Debts due to the Bank show an increase of £185,000; and Bank
Premises Account, £16,000.
The Board has granted a special bonus to the staff. The Bank can well afford it, and the Officers
certainly deserve it. , .
Finding the business of our Exchange Branch, in Pitt Street, has outgrown our premises there,
we have purchased the building opposite, known as “ Ramsay’s Chambers.” Plans of the Banking
Chamber are being prepared to suit the full requirements of our Customers, and it is proposed to let
out in offices the upper floors. As soon as the alterations are made to the new purchase the old
building will be sold.
You will note that our Reserve Funds now total £1,414,000. Having in view the large increase
in our deposits, as shown in the figures now placed before you, it is the policy of the Board to
augment the Reserve Fund from time to time.
You are all aware it is ip contemplation bv the Federal Government to issue Notes to replace
those now in circulation by the Banks. This we consider a retrograde movement, for it is against
the evidence of financial experts in all countries.
So far as this Bank is concerned we shall not suffer in profit,, j&s we shall be saved the cost of the
Notes, and the 2 per cent.'Note tax we now pay for the privilege of dtk circulation, say about £13,1 0J
per annum. Of course, more gold will now be paid over the counter.
I now beg to move that the Report and Balance-Sheet be adopted.

HEARNE’S
Bronchitis Cure
The Grandest Remedy in the World for
COUGHS & COLDS
ONE DOSE IS GENERALLY SUFFICIENT.
THOSE who have taken this medicine are amazed at
its splendid healing power. Sufferers from Bron-
chitis, Cough, Croup, Asthma, Hoarseness, Difficulty
of Breathing, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience
delightful and rapid relief; and to those who are subject
to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a
complete cure. It is most comforting in allaying Irrita-
tion in the Throat and giving Strength to the Voice,
and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption is
not known where “Coughs” have, on their first appear-
ance, been properly treated with this
medicine. No house should be without
it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose or
two is generally sufficient, and a com-
plete cure is certain.

Attack of Influenza.

Manly, Sydney’s marine suburb, although a
charming place with a sleepy and a dolee far viiente
atmosphere, has always labored under the serious disad-
vantage of having few hostelries where one can com
bine the comforts of civilisation with the ozone of the
rest resort. Ordinary hotels and hn*h-towers have failed
to fill the bill, and the consequence is that thousands of
people who would love to go to Manly have stayed
away. This trouble is drawing to a close. The Manly
Hotel Co., Limited, steps into the breach. It has pur-
chased the old Clarendon Hotel, and its 173ft.0f frontage
to the Esplanade, and on the site will erect a splendid
modern hotel, modelled on the best European and Ameri-
can models. There will be accommodation for all pur-
poses, from the palatial suite of rooms, with ex-
clusive attendance, down to the apartment of the
ordinary casual guest who takes a nice bal-
cony room for his wife and children, and has his
meals at the table d'hote. A splendid eafd, for the
benefit of day visitors will he a special feature of the
establishment. The co„ is being floated by Frank J.
McDonald, Solicitor, of Royal Chambers, Sydney, and ail
the shares hare been, underwritten. Subscription list
will be opened for one week only from August 15_*
AT POVERTY POINT.
" Vlo.": Matheson Lang makes the religious play more
aoooptable than any previous actor. He is cousin of
the Archbishop of York and nephew of Dr. Marshall
Lang, who preached in Melbourne. So theology runs in
the blood. The new piece is not a daub, like “ The Sign
of the Cross” and “ Barabbas.” I fancy “A Message
from Mars” suggested it, but it is better than that. The
suooess of that old mystery play, “Everyman,” set
authors thinking. Julius Knight was never better than
in this, as seen at Melb. Town Hall. He has a suitable
oharnel-ly tone in the voice. When he sunk into the
coffin he was all there. He would read Dante’s Inferno
well, where Dante kicks the skull of the poor chap under
the ice, or where Ugolino bites the back of his enemy’s
head through all eternity. Here are some religious
plays: Rostand’s “La Samaritaine,” rapturously wel-
comed in the little Renaissance Theatre, Paris, on a Good
Friday night, with Bernhardt as the Woman of Samaria,
and a most reverent and beautiful actor as Jesus. James
O'Neill, at San Francisco, acted the Saviour in a play
which included the crucifixion. It was announced else-
where, but prohibited. Then Massenet’s opera of
“Herodiade,” introducing John the Baptist, is familiar
in Paris. There are also Strauss’s “ Salome,” and Oscar
Wilde’s ditto. Saint-Saens’s opera of “Samson and
Delilah” is only just allowed in England. Alfieri’s
*• Saul" is a grand tragedy. Two operas on the Queen of
Sheba are by Gounod and Goldmark.
Amy Castles to an Argus interviewer : “ Isn’t it lovely
to be back in my own Melbourne again after so
many weeks in Maoriland, where the people are hospit-
able, but the weather isn’t. lam a lover of sunshine and
Australia and all things bright! I longed to be home
again.” Now, it was very sweet of Amy to glorify her
own Melbourne weather by comparing it with Maoriland
ditto, whilst taking care to praise the M.L. people; but
she can’t persuade, say, the Federal legislators, who are
an all-round body of Australians, that Melbourne it a
little bit merry and bright during the winter months.
For some days before Amy’s arrival the sky was grey and
the rain pretty persistent. Two years ago there were
six successive weeks in Melbourne when the sun remained
Invisible. It is, in fact, the last big city of Australia that
a lover of sunshine would select for winter quarters, and
the present opera season there is in danger of being
somewhat d d by the weather.
“ Mahlstick ”: The Argus republishes a selection from
Tom Carrington’s caricatures of public men, given in the
Weekly Times in the last generation. There should be a
good number in the National Gallery; but there isn’t.
There is only one lady, a fat-and-forty frosty prima
donna, Mrs. Palmieri, imported by Lyster. Her husband
brought out a miraculous fire escape, which long encum-
bered the Town Hall basement. Only a few of the por-
traits are bad. Coppin is the one atrocity. Harwood is
all right. He is there in his long beard—one of the very
few English or Austral Thespians who have liked a beard.
Ho would grow it on any pret- nee. After a trip to Eng-
land he made a speech at the Theatre Royal, in his long
face-trimmings, between the pieces. Then he appeared in
a few minutes clean shaved, as Cassandra, in “ The Siege of
Troy.” The French leading man often wears his own
beard ; and a man of the Matheson Lang cut might
enchant Australian ladies if he did the same.
Actors are apt to grow somewhat reckless in farewell
speeches. When the Melbourne gaud mayoress gave an
afternoon-tea party in honor of the Asches the day before
their departure Oscar said: “ For myself I would ask
nothing better than to remain in the Commonwealth;
but my wife, who is English-born, has longings for her
own people.” He forgot that on the previous Friday
night he had said to the audience at the Royal: “Mv
wife has not sufficient nerve to thank you for herself. As
a matter of fact, she does not want to go away at all.
But Desdemona must follow Othello "to the wars,
Petruchio must bear away his Katharine.” Of course,
Osoar, being ambitious and full of go, must get back to
the wars, and naturally his wife is thinking of her own
people. But why this muddle ?
“0.K.”: Can see no real family likeness between
“ The Passing of the Third Floor Back ” and “ A
Message from Mars,” or Dickens’s “ Christmas Carol.” In
the older stories the supernatural visitors appeared only
in a dream, and in each case there was only one person
to be converted. Horace in the comedy and Scrooge in
the “ Qarol ” were respectively an everyday, selfish, lazy
young capitalist and a miserly misanthropical old cur-
mudgeqn. They were changed into practical, warm-
hearted Christians by imaginary visitors from another
world—ghosts in Scrooge’s case—who showed them
dream-pictures, and reproved them for their selfishness.
The Third Floor Back lodger is introduced’as an actual
faotrwhp transforms 11 wide-awake contemptible citizens
into sweet-dispositioned creatures by simply looking - 'at
them and giving them “ taffy.” By spiritual influence he
does what the woman in Barrie’s comedy of “Little
Mary ” does to the people whom she cures of dyspepsia.
As the result of changing their dinner-hour and reducing
their consumption of food they all become merry and
bright and considerate for one another. The doctrine of
“ Little Mary ” is rational and wholesome, whilst that of
“ The Third Floor Back ” is irrational and soulsome, but
between the methods of their plots there is a humorous
resemblance.
“JeanSibi” does a “ show ” notice :-A somewhat
humorous entertainment was the Salv army s Daj
Salvation” at Melbourne Exhibition. from the start
Imbecility held the platform. Speaker after speaker,
full up to the brim with gaudy prayers and claptrap
hymns, raged, waved arms and defied all the forces o
logic and reason. They told fatuous stones of strange
conversions. They plundered their minds for yarns or
penitent sinners. They filled in the cracks of their dis-
course with rhodoniontade. Commissioner Hay was pro-
bably the most tempestuous of the lor. He was all frotn
and fire. He stamped and shouted. He wore the glare
of the bull in the Bovril advt. He fought for Belief with
fury, and outed Unbelief with frenzy and a violently-
throwii brick. Down below and surrounding him
was a vast mosaic of faces. These people re-
sponded to his slightest movement. When he upper-
cut Satan with a preposterous statement, they howled in
rapture and shrieked “ Alleyloover.” When he slapped
Lucifer with a piece of pious derision, they rocked in
unison and shrieked in concert. Whatever he did galva-
nised them into hysterical ecstasy and filled their mouths
with extravagant noise. And yet this man. who so
moved the crowd, is one of the crudest Salvationists in
the business. Possessing a fine sense of the theatrical,
he is, nevertheless, the epitome of the Cheap Tract and
the Intelligence That Won’t Grow Up.
“Surcingle” : Re Nat Gould’s play. “The Chance of a
Life-Time,” why the Ascot Gold Cup? Isn’t there a
Melbourne Cup? “No,” answers somebody; “hut
Blackwood used to add on a little 100-guinea cup to the
V.R.C. event.” Stealing that, of course, wouldn’t make
a drama. The thief must go for the entire stakes. Dar-
rell produced an Australian turf drama, “The Double
Event,” at least as good as Gould’s. But probably the
best horse drama of all is Boucioault’s “ Flying Scud.” It
ran 400 nights at the London Holborn, where they got
an equally long run out of its imitation, Merritt’s “ New
Babylon,” with Clarence Holt as Flotsam, the ’Tec, or
Deteekative, in stage Hebraic. Bland Holt was the
Australian Flotsam.
“ Early Door ” : The plaint of The Bulletin’s critic in
his “Sundry Shows” notice of “ The Brass Bottle ” (B
28/7/10), re‘the inordinate length of the first perform-
ance (three hours and 10 minutes), moves me to
rise and give a cheery
husk—l mean a
husky cheer. Why
should wearied
people,most of whom
have afterwards to
journey to distant
suburbs, be kept lin-
gering on in city
theatres till 11 p.m.
and after? There
seems to be a hard
and fast convention
that the play-builder
must hang on to
the coat-tails and
opera cloaks of his
customers somehow
until midnight is
well in sight, even
if he has to run in an
extra act to do it;
also, the theatre
people seem to have
the idea that the
patrons of the drama
will consider them-
selves defrauded un-
less they are kept in
tbeir seats till they
are half asleep, and
all but the last few
trams, trains and
boats have scooted
for their shelter-
sheds and wharves.
In my opinion, the
average amusement- .
hunter is not such a
whale for entertain-
ment as all that. In
fact, I think that a
theatre which ac-
quired a reputation
for closing up
promptly at 30.30
p.m. would become
a favorite house with
all classes of theatre-
goers. There are few
more pathetic sights
in this hurried world
than that of a hard-
working band of
actors endeavoring
to hold the attention of several hundred yawning
people at the end of a long evening. It is all so un-
necessary. Time was when the shortest song con-
sisted of 13 verses, with a chorus to be repeated
after every verse. That sort of song is now defunct;
people haven’t got time to listen to it, and demand
short, artistic numbers that don’t tax their powers of
endurance. Why can’t the comedy, the musical play and
the tragedy be pruned down likewise?
The Sunday-evening societies in London that go in for
encouraging the serious and unpopular drama have a bad
name for hitting on plays that lack popularity chiefly
through being frankly improper—and not funny. These
societies are independent of the Censor, and a “ Sunday
night play ” has come to mean an immoral play. The latest
production of the Incorporated Stage Society, a German
play, “ Champions of Morality,” dealt with the raiding of
a disorderly house under pressure from a local Vigilance
Society. The proprietress shows without difficulty that
the leading Purity men are down in her ledger as among
her best customers. (Sensation.) Then the local prince-
ling is found to beincluded in the haul which the police
have made. So the matter is hushed up. Finally, the pro-
prietress claims £lOOO or so for “ damage to remunerative
practice,” and the Purity men are bluffed into paying. It
might make a roaring Parisian farce, but it seems poor
stuff for a Superior society to specialise in.
“Silas”: To my idea, the brightest bit of work in
“ The Passing of the Third Floor Back ” is Torn Cannam’s
convincing ex-booky, the man who was compelled to
give up rooking the public when his voice broke. The
thing is cleverly done. The figure moves. And when
the Stranger gets at Joey, enlarging on his merits, and
weaning:him from infamy, the crippled hooky’s conver-
sion is a touching spectacle. In the silence that fell
upon a large audience on opening night I distinctly
heard the drip of falling tears. A hurried investigation
resulted in the discovery that six of Melbourne’s most
notorious layers of the odds were weeping bitterly in
the most expensive section of the house.
“Maitai”: When Hugh Ward put up his “Girl from
Rector's” pictures on the Wellington (M.L.) hoardings,
some parsons mustered and passed a resolution condemn-
ing the bright little comedy. The pilots alleged it to
be brimful of suggestive features, and deputationised the
Minister of Justice, demanding that it be put down. It
wasn’t; but an extra man had to be put on at the book-
ing office. Hugh Ward, doing the Quay this afternoon,
is reported to have raised his hat to no less than three
parsons.
“Edyson”: “Harrison O.” (B. 21,'7/’XO) hurls the
ancient cat of derision into the hair of those “ pedantic
and wildly impracticable” persons who prefer the plays
of Shaw, Barker and Galsworthy to the dramatic rot that
is the nightly fare of the frequent theatre-goer. Harri-
son drags in the “business aspect,” to the confusion of
the issue, through five-sixths of his feverish par., and then
abandons it with the assertion that even the average
“ literary person ” would rather sit through a perform-
ance of “ The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” than one of the
Shawian “ episodes ”or “ debates.” Does Harrison know
what he is talking about? How many “Second Mrs.
Tanquerays ” are we being refreshed with in Australia?
I have a fancy there is something radically wrong
with the literary side of the person who is not
satisfied with the dramatic element of “Arms and
the Man,” “Mrs. Warren’s Confession,” “Strife,” or
even “Candida,” and who prefers the furniture-smashing
Activity of the paying farce to the delicious humor and
sane movement of “You Never Can Tell,” or “The
Importance of Being Ernest,” or those delightful
Shawian trifles, “The Man of Destiny”~and “How He
Lied to His Wife.” Harrison may prefer the physical
activity of the managerial drama to the play of human
forces in which the soul is more in evidence than the
shinbone; but why should he howl? He and thousands
like him are getting what they want.
“ S.S.”: The Silver Ivingget-up is the nearest approach
human imagination, as now employed in and about the
drama, is cap ible of as a sartorial expression of profound
reverence. Jerome adopts it for his Stranger in “The
Third Floor Back.” And yet the flowing black cloak has
been the distinctive garb of the “ rooned gyurl” in melo-
d rani a for ages. Why the large black butterfly tie, so
long the property of the comic musician or the pallid
artist? And why the wig that looks like two-thirds of a
merino fleece ? In what sense are these things adjuncts
of other-worldliness? Apparently, Jerome never dreamed
of dressing this supernatural visitant as a bishop. In
point of fact, it is only necessary to put the Unknown
into gaiters, a black pinny and a shovel hat to reduce
“ The Third Floor Back ” to broad farce.
“Lud”: Hermann Vezin passes, aged 82. The
last of the veterans in Beerbohm Tree’s “School for
Scandal.” An unlucky man—a little too good for a mere
CRIMINAL CARELESSNESS.
BROWN (to Jones , straight from the roof): “ Devil
take yeh, yeh might have hurt a man!”
supporter, not quite good enough for a star. He married
Mrs. Charles Young, who had divorced her first husband.
The Youngs, with Mrs. Y.’s father and mother, the
Thomsons, were in the company which Coppin brought
from Launceston to Melbourne in 1845. Mr. and Mrs.
Vezin did not seem to agree, either. She committed
suicide by throwing herself from a high window, because
of grief for the loss of her daughter. Young died in
Sydney. Vezin was short, and not favored by Nature.
He was what is called an actor’s actor, like Wybert
Reeve, admired more by the profession than the
public. In early life he did extremely well, and
his ambition seemed to he justified." His most
successful performance was in “The Man of Airlie,” uni-
versally criticised as remarkable, yet never drawing and
continually followed with ill-luck. Vezin could not
acquire prestige. Hollingshead tried to bring him for-
ward in a very strong cast of the comedy of “John
Bull,” at the Gaiety, including also Phelps and Mathews.
However, they were regarded as a stale trio. Toole and
L. Brough were in the same cast. Vezin was the original
Dr. Primrose, with Ellen Terry, in “Olivia”; but Irving
later eclipsed him in the part. Irving would always
send for Vezin in an emergency, to replace him ; but this
might be because he did not think Vezin dangerous.
Thus he played Richard 111., Macbeth and other good
parts. Alwaj's praised—and that’s all.
“JeanSibi”: Anderson’s equine drama has some few
spots which tend to make the punter feel scornful.
There is no clerk of the course for the Gold Cup race, and
only the riders of the first and second horses weigh in
after the event. Moreover, some fastidious folk allege
that the leading jockey of Ned Duggan’s stable shouldn’t
spend his leisure in cleaning harness. They say that this
combats the tradition that no principal jock ever soils
his hands with such base employment. They also say
that it would bean advantage if Anderson supplied the
Gold Cup nags with number-d saddle-cloths. Personally
I think that this suggestion is a little too much. Ander-
son has adequately provided for the backs of his horses
with cloths like towels or serviettes. These, I imagine,
satisfy all artistic demands. As a matter of fact, the
race arrangements in “The Chance of a Lifetime” are
somewhat less open to criticism than they were in many
a Blandolt production, although they are infinitely less
funny than the circumstances, under which Smith Sim-
plicitas rides to victory.in “ The Arcadians ” ,

“Mell.: Remarkable how the Melbourne Royal has
got back its old prestige. It was toppled from the
leadership in 1855 bv Coppin’s Olympic. Coppin and
Brooke took the Royal in 1856, when it started on that
premiership which it maintained until 1862. Then the
genius of Jefferson gave the wooden Princess’s the lead
for some months. Coppin’s Haymarket, opened in 1862
could never shake the Royal, which came to the fore
again with Barry Sullivan in 1863. Thenceforward, until
the opening of the new Princess’s in 1885, it was the
leading house. Williamson, Garner and Musgrove leased
the old Princess’s, but mostly kept it shut till it was re-
built. The Opera House opened in 1872, and the Bijou,
opened in 1875, neverdeposed the Royal. Thedominating
theatrical firm made the Royal plav second fiddle to the
new Princess’s. It sunk until lifted by Bland Holt, He
was that sort of tenant who makes a place so good that
he is outbid. I understand that £lOO a week was the
Meynell and Gunn offer, at which Bland flung up the
sponge.
There has been much time, energy and good coin
of the realm wasted lately by the Rich Landlords
of Victoria. In fact, the action of the Landlords
has largely resembled that of the burglar who
lost his boots, jammed his finger, and chanced six
months’ gaol to secure a bag which was found to
contain nothing but a handkerchief and a tram
ticket. The Rich Landlords’ exertions have been
directed to retaining control of the State Upper
House. A little while ago Wrixon’s retirement
left a vacancy; and Wrixon was hardly out of
sight before Squatter Austin tore through the
constituency like a whirlwind. He has been
elected unopposed, and is now recovering his
breath. But every time Squatter Austin’s class
scores a victory of this sort it brings its own de-
struction nearer. The people can turn the flank
of all the Upper Houses in the- Commonwealth
by simply voting, at a referendum, that the power
now held by the State Governments and Parlia-
ments, and the assets and liabilities of the States,
shall be wholly transferred to the Australian Par-
liament, which shall then proceed to cut Aus-
tralia up into a reasonable number—2o or 30
perhaps—of small States, each with a handy
Constitution and a Legislature of one House
elected by adult suffrage. It is quite simple.
The Labor majority in Parliament can doit, aided
by the Labor majority in the country which put
that Labor majority into Parliament.. No one
need ask the assent of the State Assembly or
Upper House or Governor, any more than he
need ask the assent of the committee of the
Poultry Show. And every time the Legislative
Councils of Victoria or Tasmania, or any other
similar body, throws out a democratic measure, it
is bringing its downfall nearer. These bodies are
wholly at the mercy of the people, and they insist
in an insane sort of way on making the people
remember the fact.

The proposal in the new Federal Arbitration Bill
to give the President of the Court power to sum-
mon to a conference the parties to an industrial
dispute, made the N.S.W. Premier a very angry
State-Fright indeed. Said Wade :
The essence of the new departure was apparently a
conference—in itself an excellent idea ; but it. would be
intolerable to the public, whether employers or em-
ployees, to be hustled about the continent attending
conferences under Federal control when the matter
could be dealt with locally.
Well, last time_a big N.S.W. dispute was-dealt
with locally, Wade refused to force the stub-
born mine-owners to hold a conference with the
willing employees. Also, Wade was the man who
rushed special legislation through Parliament, by
the application of the gag, to rattle the keys of
the gaol in the ears of the men who were seeking
to bring about the “ excellent idea ” of a confer-
ence. It is largely, if not entirely, due to the
one-sided energy of Wade that the general public
reckons the time has passed for allowing great
industrial disputes to be dealt with locally—at all
events, while politicians of the Wade and Wood
persuasion are the local dealers.
A Christchurch (Maoriland) lirm is ap-
pealing to the Supreme Court against the de-
cision of a magistrate—just a plain magistrate—
who fined.it £30,000. At least he ordered it to
pay £lOO fine and £30,000, being threefold the
amount of certain allegedly dodged taxes. Ap-
parently a magistrate is a man of large discourse
in M.L. On this side he mostly tells the Tanked
One that it will be ss.
Alongside Parson Worrall, whom Prime
Minister Fisher pinned down the other day to the
sharp end of a gross inaccuracy, The Bulletin
proposes to nail Parson Spurr, of Melbourne.
Recently this careless preacher, while pouring
forth eloquence on the subject of the family life,
observed incidentally that “nearly 4000 infants
aged under one year perished in Melbourne last
year.” The audience seemed to receive this
piece of intelligence as proof of the iniquity
of living in Melbourne, though the most
casual recourse to official figures would prove the
wild inaccuracy of the pammical announcement.
According to the last “Victorian Year Book”
(page 302) only 4731 infants under one year
perished in Melbourne during the five gears 1904 8-
And, as a matter of fact, only 1129 one-year-olds
passed out in Melbourne during 1909 —not 4000.
Are parsons ever accurate?
THE ARCADIANS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In Arcady is ecstasy,
The skies burn blue above ;
In every tree is minstrelsy,
In every heart is love.
“O Friend,” she said, “ let us away
To Arcady the blest ” ;
And arm-in-arm, at break o’ day,
They journeyed on their quest.
\
They went by hill, they went by vale,
The foreland ways they dared ;
And he grew tired and she grew pale,
Yet on and on they fared.
They met a sailor by the sea—
An old man grey and grim—
And stayed his steps, and wistfully
A question put to him.
“ Now I have felt the burning breath
Of red-lit lands afar,
And I have seen the grin of Death
Beneath the Northern Star.
“Yea, I have wandered far from home—
So far—ye may not guess,
And watched the grey waves wash with foam
The shores of Heathenesse.
“ And I have seen the isles that bask
All golden in the sea ;
But never saw I what ye ask—
This land of Arcady.”
The forest round them seemed to swoon,
No little leaf did stir,
And in a glade, made gold with noon,
They met a forester.
“ I know no Arcady,” he said,
“ But forest-war I know—
The wolf with dripping jaws of red,
The flying fawn and doe.
“ The hawk hangs hungry in the blue,
The leopard haunts the tree ;
And ye may tread the forest through,
Nor find your Arcady."

Consult any competent judge of billiard tables, and he’ll
promptly tell you that there are no tables equal to “ Alcock’s.”
Many of the leading billiard matches have been played on
these tables—the recent match between George Gray and Fred
Lindrum, jun., when Gray scored 836, 831 coming off the red,
thus establishing two world’s records, and for which Gray
received a gold medal, is an example. This score is another
proof of the marvellous accuracy and perfect construction of
our billiard tables.
Each table is fitted with Imperial Low Cushions, and
bears our trade mark.

FASHION AND FAME
OLD habits are often better than new ones, but not always.
For instance, the old-fashioned method of cleaning the
teeth and mouth with tooth-powders and tooth-pastes is a
great mistake, presuming the object in view is to possess sound
teeth, which is of course the real aim of all treatment of the teeth.
All who wish to keep their teeth sound and whole should clearly
understand that it is necessary they should accustom themselves to
cleansing the mouth and teeth with an antiseptic liquid!
Brushing the teeth with tooth-powders and tooth-pastes can
never safeguard them from tooth-destroying microbes, for the
simple reason that the parts which are most liable to attack, the
backs of the molars and the fissures and interstices of the teeth—
the very parts where the microbes live and thrive—are not purified,
because they cannot be reached by such things as powders and
pastes. Consequently the mischief being once sent up strengthens
its hold without interruption. But a liquid dentifrice can penetrate
everywhere, and when it is antiseptic it sweeps away every trace
of microbes. Odol is such a dentifrice, and has such a practical,
antiseptic effect that it arrests all bacterial inroads and fermenta-
tion processes.
The complete disinfection of the mouth and teeth resulting from
the 1 use of Odol is due to a remarkable property which this and no
othjer preparation possesses, which being absorbed by the surface of
the. mucous membrane, and forcing itself into the hollows of the
teeth, deposits a store of antiseptic matter whose purifying
L ' ..
action continues for some
with Odol, healthy teeth
hours. By a regular cleansing
are kept absolutely intact, while
teeth already
impaired are
preserved from
further de-
cay. For this
reason Odol
must certainly
be acknow-
ledged to be
the best of all
known prepara-
tions for cleans-
ing the mouth
and teeth.
The taste of
Odol is most
delicious and
refreshing.
Odol is sup-
plied to the
public in two
distinct flavors
“ Sweet
Rose” and
“ Standard
Flavor.” The
former is de-
lightfully mild, and in special favor with ladies, while, generally,
“ Standard Flavor” is preferred on account of its niore expressed
taste and refreshing and invigorating effect.
It should be borne in mind by purchasers that the full-
size flask is more advantageous to them than the haif-size
flask, as it will last TWICE as long.

IN
NANANA LAND
A Mr. Tinckvell, of Brooloo, near Gympie,
is alleged to have killed a quarter of an acre of
that imported curse, water-hyacinth, which was
growing in a creek on his farm by spraying it
with cattle-dip mixture. Five gallons, double
the strength of that used in the dip, was sufficient
for the murderous deed. The water in the creek
was not poisoned, and stock which drank it were
not affected in any way.
Queensland is setting a good example to
the other States in regard to the imported “ex-
pert,” and has apparently come to the decision
that the locally-grown article is just as good as, if
not better than, the article grown, trained or pro-
duced in the Cold Country, United States or
Canada. When dairy-expert Thomson unhar-
nessed from his job, the vaqancy was filled by a
local cow authority. Dodd, an imported chief
“ vet,” has been succeeded by C. <T. Pound,
Government Bacteriologist. A. H. Benson, the
boss overseer of the fruit fly and other pests,
having taken up a similar position in Tasmania,
has been succeeded by Ross, manager of the State
farms at Hermitage and Westbrook. His former
job of farm-manager has been taken over by
James Mitchell, late manager of Brisbane Accli-
matisation Gardens. Altogether, Bananaland
has filled quite a number of responsible positions
without yelling for help once.
Queensland’s sheep have got very close up
now to where the tally stood in 1892 —the last of
the big boom years—and, all going well, they
ought to reach the old record before 1910 is done
with. The 1892 tally was 21,708,310; but from
that point there was an avalanche of perishing
jumbucks till bedrock was reached at 7,213,985 in
1902. The number at the end of last year was
19,593,791. And if next year it reaches the sum-
mit and then starts to swoop down again, ex-
N.S.W. Astronomer Russell will probably
shoulder up his 6ft. of earth to remark that the
experience merely supports his ridiculed 19-year
cycle theory. But it will be more to the
purpose if somebody gets up and points out that
Queensland’s sheep-ownership still isn’t distri-
buted to any extent worth mentioning, since 245
squatters own 67 per cent, of the total, and GB4
holdings (many of them in the same hands)
include no less than 90 per cent, of the lot.
Anderson Dawson, who died the other
day, was one of the many unsuccessful Kimberley
(W.A.) miners. Then he settled in Charters
Towers, made things hum during the ’9l strike,
and was one of the 15 who climbed into Parlia-
ment on the back of that upheaval in 1893, having
for his mate as'game a fighter as himself, little
Johnny Dunsford. When Tom Glassey got politi-
cally unsound, “ Andy ” led the party, and formed
the first Labor Ministry in Australia. It only
held its grip for a week, because Boyd Dunlop
Morehead and his crowd, who promised to sup-
port it, turned turtle. But Morehead, being
mortgaged up to the eyes to the Q. N. Bank,
could hardly help himself. Andy passed his
mantle to Billy Browne, when he went into the
Senate with Higgs and Stewart. Of the 15 Labor
members who arrived in 1893, Dawson, Dunsford,
Browne, Lovejoy and King are dead ; Fisher is
Prime Minister ; Turley is President of the Senate,
and McDonald Speaker of the Reps. Daniels and
Hoolan dropped out. Cross, Kerr and Jackson
meandered after the fleshpots. Mat Reid retired
after a monotonous round of defeats, and only
Herbert Hardacre remains where the electors of
Leichhardt set him 17 years ago.
C. F. Pemberton, who succeeds R. T.
Darker on the railways as locomotive engineer,
got his early railway experience in India, where
lie was born. When only 21 years old he-was in
charge of the construction works on the railway-
then being built from Rawal Pindi to
Peshawar in the jaws of the Khyber Pass.
Four years later he came to Australia and
joined the Victorian Railway Department.
In another seven years—in 1891 —he was ap-
pointed foreman of the Queensland railway
workshops at Ipswich. Since then he has been
district locomotive superintendent at Rockhamp-
ton and Townsville. Last April he was appointed
locomotive superintendent, in succession to
Darker, who was promoted to Henry Horniblow’s
vacant shoes as locomotive engineer. Now he
again succeeds Darker, who has given up the
struggle with old age. As for Henry Horni blow,
he is dead and in Heaven.

And So
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I CLOTHED you in the fairest fancies
Of a poet’s necromancies ;
Not contented when I found you
Just to put my arms around you.
I built for you a temple holy,
And its incense, drifting slowly,
Bathed you in a mystic splendor—
You, so human and so tender !
Then some word you’d lightly spoken,
And my dreams lay crushed and broken.
It seemed as though there ne’er could be
A balm to heal my misery.
You were stripped of all my fancies,
All my mystic necromancies.
You were then just as I’d found you,
And—l put my arms around you.
QUEENSLAND.
GARRY.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane. Jury 30, 1910.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Invitations are already beginning to pour out
for the carnival week. Among them are the
cards for a Government House reception on Fri-
day (12th). It is located at the Exhibition Hall,
and is to be about the briefest thing of its kind on
record—9.3o to 11p.m.; scarcely worth donning
war-paint for.
Speaker J. T. Bell, though at latest slightly
better, is still very seriously ill; and a host of
friends are sympathising sincerely with Mrs. «T. T.
in her long-continued anxiety.
The balls have started rolling, and for the next
month or so they may be expected to roll two
deep. The tram boys had their annual hop last
week, and the arrangements were so good that
they might well be followed by those who direct
things from the seats of the mighty. The rail-
way men came next with a square yard of invita-
tion ticket, followed by a palm-decked room full
of signal lights, with lovely roses from engineer
Pagan’s garden. Finally, Mrs. South-Brisbane
Mayoress Savage engineered a successful whirl in
the interests of the Brisbane General Hospital,
whereat the decorations were almost as interest-
ing as the get-up of the only male in fancy-dress.
Bob Philp, who turned the handle that opened
the Beaudesert show last week, uttered a remark
that has made people sit up and take notice, as
well as refreshment. Hesaid that he hoped the pre-
sent Government would be allowed to live out its
allotted span, and not be brought to an untimely
end. Now, just lately, nothing has been heard of
any murderous designs upon the Phidston regime,
but this utterance suggests that a canker is gnaw-
ing' at what Percy, in “The Dollar Princess,” calls
the “ victuals.” The said Beaudesert show was a
record for many things—for the flowers thf.t came
from Mrs. W. Collins’s garden, and from those
of the Strettons and Hinchcliffes; for the
l>ad service at t! e luncheon, and for the tinned-
dog vegetables with which the visitors were re-
galed what time the show benches were crammed
with lovely fresh market-garden eatables. And
in the matter of young population, it would be
hard to find a better showing than Beaudesert’s
within the Commonwealth.
To be a successful medical practitioner in the
wilds of this State a man must be a versatile
genius. I know one such in a country town. Keisa
top-notcher at the sawbones business; shoots with
a directness that generally lands him a handsome
winner at the targets, rides a motor cycle at a
pace that defies every known traffic regulation,
scrapes a pretty fiddle in the local orchestra, and
does a little in the champion tennis courts. One
time, during an annual outbreak of frivolity, he
was billed for a place in the overture and in a
subsequent quartette. The orchestra had just
disposed of the overture when an urgent call came
for Sawbones, a man having torn himself to pieces
about five miles out of town. It looked tottery
for the quartette; but the doctor mounted his
motor, dashed off into the night, fixed his shat-
tered patient, and racing back, twiddled the first-
violin part in the quartette as if nothing had hap-
pened to disturb his artistic thoughts.
A downpour of pre-wedding teas has com-
menced. After one or two small flutters, Mamma
Lightollar set the cup a-steaming at the Caffi
Eschenhagen on Friday afternoon with about 150
guests, in honor of the coming Palmer alliance.
The pretty little bride-elect, in a copper-tinted
chiffon cloth and a greeny brown hat, smiled her
happiness on all and sundry.
Many friends are mourning the death of Mrs.
George Warry, whose wedding last year—she
used to be Miss Lizzie Heal —was one of the social
events of the season. The Warrys only returned
from a European honeymoon late last summer.
Theirs was a brief happiness for which they had
waited about ten years, and it ended with almost
tragic suddenness.
A visiting doctor—he hails from Victoria—
calls attention to the incompleteness of a univer-
sity without a medical school. As the Kidston
idea has it at present, the Queensland Uni. will
partake, as far as the medical student is con-
cerned, of the nature of an empty shell. With a
general hospital of 250 beds handy, this seems
like a waste of good opportunity.
The coming show is trying to make and break
another record ; and as for the country cousin’s
difficulty of finding a place whereon to lay his
head, it looks like being a very easy first. There
will be some new points of interest, among them
a court devoted to the Solomon Islands, where
the rubber is going to come from, and where it
used to be quite easy to be eaten to death. The
crowd is always a show to itself ; and then your
own Excellency and his determined helpmate will
be with us once more, and the welcome will be
something to remember, for Queensland loves the
Pale Governor and his practical spouse.
Packed houses nightly honor J.C.W.’s “Dollar”
bill. In spite of cool press notices in the South,
Grace Edmond is toasted as just It here. She
is smiling her way into big popularity, in which
the whole co. is sharing. Florence Young and
Roberts will transplant “The Orchid” to His
Majesty’s for show week, with “The Waltz
Dream ” to follow.
The South Brisbane Council has at last decided
to have a picture show of its own, and the col-
lection of the late R. J. Randall will soon deco-
rate the walls of the “South’s” Technical Hall.
Father George Randall makes the gift, which is
one of real value. The Council’s determination
to house the collection constitutes something of a
record in a way of an Australian city honoring a
local prophet.
The Brisbane city fathers are on fire ; and the
city’s continued prosperity is responsible for the
incendiarism. Provided the ratepayers approve,
they are going to ask for a loan of £lOO,OOO to buy
a decent ferry service and make sundry wharf
and other improvements. Mayor Hetherington,
who will probably get his name upon the long-
contested foundation-stone of the new town hall,
is at any rate bent on really doing something—
even if somebody else has to pay for it.
They still take their hats off to the Chinaman
up north. The very smartest wedding a northern
coastal town has had for ages happened the other
day, when a little Ah Kitten was married to a
young Ah Cat. There isn’t anything wrong in
that, of course; it is far better than a piebald
wedding, anyhow. What made a correspondent
feel so uncomfortable about it was that the
mayor and mayoress, and the police magistrate,
and all local society turned up and beamed at the
ceremony, and made fulsome speeches at the
subsequent breakfast, which, according to the
papers, was “a very sumptuous affair.”
The local Auto. Club had a very jolly run on
Saturday afternoon to Sandgate. Thirty cars
carried out about 84 folk. The dandy of the meet
was a huge machine owned by Mr. and Mrs.
McCarthy, of Melbourne, who are on a tour that
won’t end till almost Yarra bank's Cup time,
according to present arrangements. Dr. and Mrs.
Leigh, also of Melbourne, were of the party.
Yours affectionately, Mario.

With Terrible Eruptions —Grew
Worse in Spiteof Doctors —Would
Scratch and Tear Flesh Unless
Hands were Tied—Mother Says
HE WOULD HAVE DIED
BUT FOR CUTICURA
"My little son, when about a year
and a half old, began to have sores
I&s
Mt
come out on his
face. I had a phy-
sician treat nim,
but the sores grew
worse. Then they
began to come on
his arms, then on
other parts of his
body, and then one
came on his chest,
worse than the
others. Then I
called another physician. Still he grew
worse. At the end of about a year and
a half of suffering he grew so bad that
I had to tie his hands in cloths at night
to keep him from scratching the sores
and tearing the flesh. He got to be
a mere skeleton, and was hardly able
to walk.
“My aunt advised me to try Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment. So great
~as her faith in them that she gave me
a small piece of the Soap to try and
a little of the Ointment. I took them
home without any faith, but to please
her I tried it and it seemed to dry up
the sores a little. I sent to a drug store
and got a cake of Cuticura Soap and
a box of the Ointment and followed
directions. At the end of two months
the sores were all well. He has never
had any sores of any kind since. He
is now strong and healthy, and I can
sincerely say that only for the most
wonderful Cuticura Remedies my pre-
cious child would have died from those
terrible sores. I used only one cake of
Cuticura Soap and about three boxes
of Ointment.
“I am a nurse and my profession
brings me into many different families
and it is always a pleasure for me to tell
my story and recommend Cuticura Rem-
edies. Mrs. Egbert Sheldon, R. F. D. 1,

REMEDIES NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
It is, in the first place, essentially a food—not a mere
drug stimulant. It is a food that feeds the whole of the
nervous system with those elements the lack of which in
the structural tissues constitutes the neurasthenic con-
dition. It is so easily assimilated that in one hour it is
fully assimilated, thus creating quickly a renewed mental
and physical vigor. This is not mere stimulation ; but is
really the sensati >n produced by the actual assimilation
and storage of those refined elements necessary to nerve
comfort and vigor. This uplifting is not—as in the case
of tonics and stimulants—a mere transient whipping up,
but an actual addition to the nerve-structure and nerve-
strength of the individual. Readers of Tub Bulletin are
invited to test “ Antineurasthin,” as also to read the

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-

in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache —a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.

C.R.E. : We only pay for fresh-laid jokes. The first

the others naturally followed it E.S. : It used to be a
better joke than that when it was new C.T.C. : Very
inferior thing and apropos of nothing that is visible to
the naked eye J.L.: The train that was quite safe
because the Commissioners were aboard lacks perspective
and nearly everything else that is desirable in a train
M.N.W. : They are a lamentable collection. Something
more might be said, but the dictionary has given out.
E.N. : Every writer and every artist has rushed us with
ideas about the Richmond accident. It is too much
altogether... Dill T. : Why should we reproduce a small
blotted monstrosity labelled “ The Kid” in the act of
grossly insulting a large stupid outrage labelled “ The
Loafer”?
“ 0.K.” : Following up my assertion that
Victoria, which was quite recently opened-up by
“new' chums” has developed a petty spirit of
antagonism to them, I quote from a last-week’s
debate in the Vic. Assembly :
Mr. McLellan said that lie was against spending the
money of the people to bring out immigrants, who would
enter into competition with Australian workers.
According, then, to this parochial-minded spokes-
man for a Vic. constituency, no immigrant who
comes to Australia to work for his living and
make a home can be an Australian worker. He

“Australian worker.” Heavens and Earth!
What better recommendation can a man have as
a worker than that he came here to work ? And
what better recommendation can he have as an
Australian than that he voluntarily became an
Australian? Many men are Australians because
they can’t help it. They just happened to be

# T'HB Magic Flute is an absolutely new style of musical m-

entirely of nickel-plated metal, and it is strong and durable.
It will never wear out or get out of order. The most ex-
traordinary im.tatlons of bird-calls and warblines can be
produced, and it cannot be excel led for teaching a parrot to
whistle. You can play any tune you know after a little
practice, and the tone is very musical and flute-like. It is cap-
able of the most charming modulations, more closely re-
sembling the legato of a violin than is possible on any key* d
instrument, and the most popu'ar melody or the most elabo-
rate operatic air can be played, either ns a solo or accompanied,
in a manner that would be enthusiastically applauded even
on a concert platform. Anyone can play the M- gic Flute,
and the performer with the true *' gift of music ” will find it.

“The Heathen” heaves the Brick of
Scorn.
On a recent wet Sunday I read with interest a magazine
article on revivals and revivalists, wherein the Saviour
was robbed of his “ u ” and spelt “Savior” to save some
of America’s time. There was a good deal in it about
Billy Sunday, the ex-baseball player who is now the lead-
ing revivalist of the U.S., mainly because he preaches
with baseball actions. One of "the illustrations showed
him performing before an immense crowd. His atti-
tude is that of one who has received a knock-
out blow, or has been jerked backward off his feet
by the grapnel of a drifting balloon catching him
under the chin. Of M. B. Williams, a famous traveller
in hysteria, who trained Mr. Sunday, another revivalist
says : “ He conducted revivals in 134 cities and towns in
lowa, and, so far as I know, there has never been a re-
vival in one of them since. Ministers call it ‘the burnt
district.’ He was so sensational that anything after him
was tame and powerless. He did everything that way.
Big chorus, big crowd, his attacks on sin so fierce, his
slang, so picturesque, in nearly every place a personal
fight with fists or horse-whips, and even threatened
gun-play—you can’t follow that with any ordinary
method.” These laudatory remarks, of course,
were made before the recent throat-cutting of
a Yankee weverend by a holy assassin whose pulpit
he had been occupying. That record will probably stand
until some saint scalps another with a sharpened collec-
tion plate and grills him on his own altar. The freak
revivalist has not yet struck Australia; but there are
shoals of him—and her—doing well in America. Two
twin brothers, who shave, dress and talk alike, draw well
because they keep the congregation guessing which is
which. A female horror’s prize stunt is shaking down
her hair during her platform frenzies and putting it up
again in full view of all. A cowboy Bible-puncher relies
on his unshorn hair and exaggerated pants. Another
bustles on to the platform with his drummer’s sample-
case as his trade-mark. The prize freak, though, is the
“Child Evangelist”—a noxious cub of 14, who has been
taught a certain series of declamations which he yelps
and shrieks at the lamentable grown-ups that go to his
meetings. The .whelp’s father “manages” him in the
theatrical sense. Apparently, the Chapman-Alexander
troupe of holy showmen, recently in these parts, are old-
fashioned and conservative in their methods when com-
pared to some of the leaping hysteria-vendors of religious
vaudeville now showing in the U.S.
' ‘Surcingle ” digs up an old story :
Under the title of “The Great Turf Fraud,’’ Dick
Donovan makes a'book of the greatest English horsey
sensation, the case of Benson, Kurr, Bale and Murray.
The most startling feature of the case was in their having
bribed three leading Scotland Yard- detectives—Meikle-
jolin, Druscovich and Palmer. Benson was the chief
rascal. They had printed in Edinburgh a newspaper
called Sport, which began with -No. 1713. -Benson, an
expert journalist, wrote the stuff. The sole purpose was
to exalt the virtues of himself, under the name of Mont-
gomery. This Montgomery had invented an almost
infallible system of turf betting, for which he was boy-
cotted by the .bookmakers. Five hundred copies of Sport
were printed. These were sent round to rich people on
the Continent of Europe, with French translations of the
portions about Montgomery as “ a foe to the harpies of ’
the .turf, who prey upon a deluded public.” Victims
were found.to invest large sums through Montgomery,
and the rogues thus netted about £14,000, including
£lO,OOO from a Madame de Goncourt. They would have
had her for £30,000 more but for her having to realise
securities in order to raise the wind. On this point
she consulted her lawyer, who sniffed the swindle
at once. The lady promptly started for London.
Her first business was to see the “Lor Maire.” The
mayor communicated with the detective office. There-
upon Benson and co. received the wink, and boited.
Druscovich had principal charge of the job of hunting them
down. The complicity of the detectives was ultimately
proved bv clumsily-disguised telegrams which they sent to
the offenders. The latter had changed their French notes
for Bank of England ones, but the numbers of these were
known. Yet it was contrived to swap the notes for
Scotch ones of £lOO each. However, after some of the
Scotch notes had been negotiated, the numbers
of them also were published. Consequently, there
was a drying up of resources. The slipperiness of
the offenders suggested to Abrahams, the prosecuting
solicitor, that there was knavery in the detective
office.; Superintendent Williamson became suspicious,
on this hint, and kept on the qui vive. Light
broke through with the. capture of Murray. Being
hard up, he had tried to cash one of the Scotch £lOO
notes. Then Kurr was arrested. Then Benson and
Bale, who were found at Rotterdam. Benson got 15
years, Kurr and Bale 10 years, and Murray 18 months.
The next swoop was on the unsuspecting detectives—
Meiklejohn, Druscovich and Palmer, all arrested while
quietly at work in the office. With them was arraigned
Froggatt, Murray’s solicitor, the charge being aiding a
conspiracy. Benson and Kurr, haled from prison, gave
evidence against them. They were sentenced to two
years apiece, i
“Home Signal”: There is no need to
mention on which State’s railway system the
following incident took place. Just as a suburban
train was about to start, a determined looking
littlp old woman in black scurried from the book-
ing offibe and scrambled nimbly into the last com-
partment of the last carriage—a second-class
smoker. After giving the five men travellers it
contained permission to continue smoking, she
settled back and gazed tranquilly outof the window
whilst three stations came and went. Then the
collision-caravan ran into a station where a big
goods engine was juggling ponderously with
a string of trucks. The shunting had reached
the stage at which the goods engine required
the down line, on which the passenger train
stood, to run past its string and hook on to
the other end. In order to be ready as soon as
the passenger train moved out, the goods driver
brought his locomotive slowly up to within a few
yards of the guard’s van. As it approached, the
juggernaut gave a preliminary hiss and then
burst into a ferocious roar. On the instant, the
door of the last compartment of the stationary
train flung open, and a small black figure bounded
on to the platform and charged like a distracted
hen’ at the steam-enveloped giant. The stout,
red-faced driver saw her dashing towards him and
flinched in his cab; but she didn’t strike'him.
Bushing at the front of the juggernaut, she
clouted it three times on its immense iron chest
with her umbrella as though she were
beating off an intruding cow. Then, running
jdong to the cab, she shook a thin, black-
gloved fist in the driver’s face and shrieked :
“ Pon’t you dare to run your filthy machine over
jpp, you clumsy fellow ! I don’t travel on your
sjjly railways often; but when Ido I take good
pjire that no fool of a man makes mincemeat of
me. Go along with you. you great booby!”
Without giving the wretched man a chance to
reply, the alert old lady scuttled back to her car-
riage, leaving the stout driver redder in the face
and wilder than he had ever been since entering
! the service of Mr. Fate. It is a humiliating thing
for a driver of many years’ service to have his
engine publicly thrashed by an old lady ; but Mr.
Fate’s railways deserve all the humiliation that
can be heaped on them. If old ladies would take
to beating railway engines with their umbrellas
as a regular thing, it might be the salvation of
Mr. Fate.
Do you know that croup can be prevented!?
Give Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy as soon as the
child becomes hoarse, or even after the croupy
cough appears, and it will prevent the attack. It
is a certain cure for croup, and has never been
know to fail.*
In a recent; court tussle on the North
Coast (N.S.W.) the two litigants were a Hindu
and a Syrian. The latter opened the Bible and
kissed it fervently at a page describing the fall
of Syria. And Syria fell sure enough. Which re-
calls that when Josiah Thomas, P.M.G., opened the
Good Book to take the usual oath of Ministerial
office, the yarn is that the passage which met his
eye read, “Josiah... reigned thirty and one
years.” The yarn is probably a lie; but it is a
good lie, anyhow.

Wherever there is a
case of enfeebled diges-
tion, whether from ad-
vancing age, illness, or
general debility, there is a
case for Benger’s Food.
When the stomach becomes weakened, the digestion of ordinary food
becomes only partial, and at times is painful, little of the food is assimilated,
and the body is consequently insufficiently nourished. This is where Benger s
Food helps. It contains in itself the natural digestive principles, and is quite
different from any other food obtainable.
All doctors know and approve of its composition, and prescribe it freely.

The British Law Society has solemnly
passed a vote of censure on Lloyd George (himself
a' lawyer) for having stated that his learned
brethren are consistent opponents of all legal re-
forms which would tend to lower their fees. The
pretentious hypocrisy of wig and gown deceives
even the wearers, seemingly. They actually
believe themselves devoted to the interests of the
public. '• •

the reverse, possibly accompanied by a
certain amount of dandruff or scurf-dust.

Qtyres immediate and careful attention.

tion that you are threatened with Hair

assist your hair to (recover its strength
and luxuriance and beauty, to eliminate

A Night
Alarm !
WORSE than the alarm
of fire is the brassy
cough of Croup which
sounds like the cLJ-
dren’s death-knell, and it
means death unless something
is done quickly. There is little
time then to send away for
help, and the father and mother
must stand idly by, watching
their darling choke to death
unless they have prudently
made preparation for the sud-
den attack. Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery never fails to
give instant relief, and cures
the worst form of Croup.
There is no disease that creeps
on more insidiously, or re-
quires more prompt treatment
than Croup. It often comes without the slightest warning ; the little one
going to bed apparently quite well, until the mother is awakened, distressed
and frightened in the middle of the night, by the brassy cough and the
choking for breath. If proper medicine be not instantly given, in a few
treatment may be of no avail. Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is ai -dy
which mothers can rely upon, for a few doses will control the cough and
relieve the choking, and continued regular doses will soon make everything
right again, it is the wise mother who prepares for trouble in time of peace,
and always keeps a bottle of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery on hand for such an emergency as
this. Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery can be safely given to the smallest child, for it contains no
opiate or other poisons. It is pleasant to the taste, and the children like it, so there is never
any trouble in getting them to take it.
WHAT A MOTHER SAYS:
“OFTEN HAD TO SEND FOR A DOCTOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NICHT.
“These last three years,” writes Mrs. G.
Marriott, Chloride and William Streets, Broken
Hill, N.S.W., “I have always kept a bottle of
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery in the house. My
boy used to suffer very much with Croup, at 1
we have often had to send fora doctor in the
middle of the night, thinking he would choke
before morning-. Also my little girl suffered
with Croup and Bronchitis very badly, but since
I used Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery X have
never had a doctor to them. My little girl’s Bron-
chitis is cured, and if ever I find the slightest
sign of Croup on either of them I give them a
dose of New Discovery, and it stops it at once.”

Price, 21s.
A Jingle of Hurry.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HEAVENS ! how we have to hurry through
this noisy little life ;
Going hard from nine till six to keep a
kiddie and a wife ;
Catching trains and missing ferries—hanging on
to cabs and trams ;
Dodging motor-cars and lorries with indignant,
hurried “ Damns.”
Buying, selling, cheating, scheming, adding
figures page by page,
Using ev’rv blessed minute until finished by Old
Age;
Seconds, minutes, months and decades pass us
swiftly by, alack !
Pass and fly like laden robbers and we cannot call
them back !
Bending o’er our work we promise, in a faint,
half-hearted way,
“We will snatch a sunny fortnight from the
scramble some fine day ! ”
But we never do break wholly from the grip of
the Machine;
Death alone comes in to free us from the merciless
routine.
Hurry, hurry from the cradle to the deep and
narrow grave;
Learning lessons, manners, dancing—how to work
and how to save ;
Etiquette and regulations—ev’ry sort of formulas,
From the flush of dawn to midnight, help to spend
Youth’s summer day ;
Then the world-cares, fierce, insistent, come in
force to take their toll
(Paid in leisure, peace and sunlight) of the life-
time of a soul;
Days are shrunken, minutes scarcer, there is less
of love and song
When the black time-tables beckon to the young,
reluctant throng ;
From the college to the city—from the counter to
the chair,
Moving ever swiftly onward each to : his allotted
share;
Each to do his work or shirk it—each to his suc-
cess or fall,
Ever do the young men answer to the mighty
System’s call.
Hurry, Brothers! Hurry! Hurry! There is
little time to spare ;
Telephones are ringing wildly—telegrams lie
ev’rywhere ;
If you will insist on wedding, hurry up and tie
the knot;
Marriage is the Happy Ending, but it complicates
Life’s Plot;
If you ever think of dying, try to let the office
know
When the funeral is starting, and no doubt some-
one will go;
One of us will follow, Brother, to the crowded
burial ground,
And wait till the undertaker spreads the wreaths
upon the mound ;
Then providing, Silent Brother, that it is not
after five,
He will once more seek the office, thanking God
he is alive;
Then we’ll gather up your papers and square up
the draughty room
Where you toiled till you departed for the chill
and idle tomb.
Hurry! Hurry / Life is fleeting, and the jobs
keep piling up !
Breakfast! You’ve no time to eat it! Standing,
drain the steaming cup !
Hear the roar of the electrics ! Hear the whistles
and the bells !
Bidding you to Hurry ! Hurry ! What a tale
that racket tells !
Vain is all your foolish sighing for the coaching
days of yore ;
Modern Life flies smoking onward with a rattle
and a roar;
Hear the clatter of the signal and the clashing of
the gate !
Through the hills the mournful wailing of a train
some seconds late
Echoes, warning us to hurry ! ’Tis the mandate of
the Age,
And he cannot disregard it who would earn his
daily wage !
Take the challenge up or leave it—Progress sets
the killing pace ;
Life has quickened from a canter to a smoking,
steaming race.

HORATIO BREATHLESS.
The Triumph of the Dead.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEATRICE WARD, an art student of
some years, suffering from misery and a
woeful lack of room, determined to have
a studio.
After a week’s hunting, she found a suitable
room—large, airy and well lit, with windows
facing north and south.
It was not luxurious, but she had plenty of
space. She had made a specialty of heads, and
three parts of her accumulated art treasures con-
sisted of studies of the northern extremity of
mankind. These she arranged right round her
studio above all the other work, and in the winter
nights she would sit there with the fire burning,
its ruddy light playing over the heads, making
them live.
She gave up the boarding-house altogether,
took a tiny bedroom adjoining the studio, and
made her home there. In the day-time
other artists drifted in and out. Some of them
were Bohemians —sorts of parodies on humanity
into which God had breathed the breath of life
and never endowed with principles—and they
brought strange atmospheres with them. At
night, when the big front door downstairs was
closed, Beatrice would lock her door, light her
fire, and sing softly while she worked on black
and white studies.
■* * * *
The Business Man was portly, middle-aged and
comfortable. He had not the slightest interest in
either literature or art, except as aids to the
enjoyment of life. A picture was a useful thing
to relieve the monotony of a wall, but between
the making of pictures and boots there was no
difference, and, anyhow, he always preferred
photographs to pictures —they were more real and
took much less time in the making. A book was a
useful thing to have when one had time to kill and
all the available newspapers had been devoured.
But as for being the expression of the soul
of the maker, well —rats ! There were two books
that summed up the wisdom and pathos of
humanity—the works of Burns and Shalcspeare.
All the rest were vanity and repetition.
He used to stroll in in his quiet way, and bring
with him bags of choice fruit. He hated senti-
ment ; solid comfort was his hobby.
And Beatrice would smile while she munched
the fruit, and lead him to talk of the events of the
work-a-day world —topics on which he was deeply
interesting, for he was a man of the world, philo-
sophical and human.
One afternoon he found her with her hat and
gloves on, ready to go out. His face fell, but
brightened up as she said, gleefully :
“Oh, I’m so glad you’ve come. There’s a re-
ception on at Negri Sindhia’s studio, to see his new
picture. Negri, you must know, is a Eurasian
artist, who just paints for the love of it—he has
private means which make it unnecessary for him
to live by his art. I want you to take me
down there. I’m just dying to see his picture.”
He took the longest way round. It pleased him
to be seen on the block with the beautiful girl
in her dainty costume of book muslin.
It was four o’clock when they arrived at Negri’s
studio, and that polished Asiatic received them
with extravagant expressions of delight. The
rooms—there were three of them—were full of a
well-dressed, brainy crowd of young people of
both sexes, who had exhausted the pictures,
cleaned up the refreshments, and split up into
groups, smoking.
Some one dragged the Business Man off to
introduce him to a Burns crank, and Beatrice
was whisked off in another direction to be intro-
duced to the Pagan, who was just beginning to
make himself something of a name as a writer.
* * * *
The next afternoon found the Pagan at Bea-
trice’s studio. He looked round the long array of
heads, examined them critically, and remarked
reflectively :
“ You’ll be a great portrait-painter some day if
you persevere.”
“ I want to add yours to my procession. Will
you let me?”
“ With pleasure. I say, you seem to have the
gift of preserving the likeness and yet idealising
the person.”
She laughed :
“It is intentional. I found I could retain the
perfect likeness and make the face that of an
angel or demon, just as I chose ; so I have ideal-
ised all those I hang on my wall.”
“I see. You chose your company, even in
pictures.”
“ Yes. Environment, according to Drummond,
is everything.”
“ When shall I sit?” inquired the Pagan.
“Now, if you will. Sit here and talk to me
some more of the surf and the black shingle
beaches. I want you to be quite natural, and
then I will paint you'as you really are.”
He sat for her every day for a week, and as she
painted him she studied him while he reeled off
tale upon tale and reminiscences by the volume.
The man was a born storyteller, and the girl,
analysinghim, discovered that hehad noidea where
fact ended and fiction began. He was a creator
and not a record. His riotous imagination swept
him away, and he suffered from a species of
mental intoxication that made it impossible for
him to give a plain unvarnished account of any-
thing. He would embellish unconsciously, and
brighten the facts with gems of fiction which
sparkled in the memory.
She laid down her brush to listen to his story.
He leaned towards her with set brows and half-
closed eyes, the words coming in a tense whisper.
His haunting blue eyes became more eerie.
Beatrice watched him, hearing no word of his
tale but noting every line of the expressive face.
Then grasping her brushes, she painted feverishly
for half a minute.
The Pagan’s voice died away —the girl sprang
up.
“It’s my masterpiece!” she cried, clapping
her hands.
In a moment he was at her side. The face
seemed to start from the canvas, and he almost
bent his head to hear the words it seemed trying
to utter.
“ Surely that’s not me, Beatrice!” he said in
an awed whisper.
“It is—as you looked when you leaned forward
and whispered.”
He turned to her in admiration.
“Beatrice, let us join forces. Paint pictures
like that and I’ll weave romances around them,
and together we’ll bewilder the world.”
“ If you will always be my model !” she half
whispered, dipping her face into the Chinese
water lilies that trembled over the rim of a majo-
lica vase.
There was silence for half a moment, silence in
which the waving of the jonquil-like Chinese lilies
was distinctly audible, and then Beatrice felt his
arm steal round her shoulders.
“ Alwav and alway, darling—right to the end,
and in the dim beyond if memory and choice sur-
vive.”
She pushed his face away.
“Look at all those people watching you ! ” she
laughed, pointing to the painted heads and faces
of black and white.
They spent the rest of that afternoon up the
river, and then they floated homeward, hand in
hand, through the sunset fire. Dinner at the
Trocadero, and then through the glittering streets
of an enchanted city to hear the Italians in “II
Trovatore.”
The golden summer days sped away in a
species of intoxication. All their friends gave
them up—or said they did ; for they had only
time for one another. And how they worked !
Two novels and a multitude of short stories and
sketches and a whole gallery of studies for the
illustrations. Then there were “jVlodern Fairy
Tales” by the Pagan, illustrated by Beatrice
Ward—dainty tales founded on the story of their
own loves.
But there was a dark shadow in the picture, a
minor note in the gushing music of their happi-
ness. The Pagan’s sight was failing. He con-
sulted oculist after oculist, and just as he stood
on the threshold of fame and in the gates of
success he knew the end had come. Total blind-
ness was within measurable distance.
Day by day he fought the failing sight, hiding
the worst from the girl whose heart he knew it
would break; and week by week his visual power
melted way. At last he could not distinguish
even Beatrice across the street, and his fingers
trembled as they hovered over the typewriter
keys.
All in a week the last glimmer of light died
out. No more splendid sunrises, no more skies
of maize green and flaming stars of evening, no

Peps Ensure Ease 8 Restful Nights
ELDERLY PEOPLE are usually troubled with
chronic chest coughs, which grow more obstinate
with age and get speedily worse year after year,
largely as the result of treating coughs and colds by
dosing the stomach with dangerous drug-laden mixtures
instead of bathing the breathing tubes and lungs with
the soothing and healing breathe-able essences of the
wonderful Peps tablets.
It is a striking tribute to the true medicinal value of
the Peps treatment that even in the most obstinate
cases Peps have banished old folks’ coughs. Even
where the bronchial tubes have lost their elasticity
through many decades of chronic inflammation, Peps
have conquered the incessant irritation, cleared the
bronchial tubes, cured the cough, and brought back
restful nights and peaceful days.

Bays l am now 57 years of age. and for nine months
Buffered from severe Bronchitis. At first the cough was but
slight, but it gradually grew worse and became so bad at
length that I had to get up in the night and sit by the fire. I grew weak
and used to be bathed in night-sweats. I had a nasty pain in the chest ,
and was greatly alarmed at the blood which used to streak the large
quantities of phlegm I brought up. I had medical treatment and tried
many so-called remedies, \yithout result. Seeing that Peps were a proved
cure for chest and lung troubles, I tried them as a last resource, and was
astonished at the wonderful results. They gave me instant relief and
quite cured me. I am now a different woman and the cough has
vanished, thanks to the wonderful Peps.”
PEPS go Direct to the Lungs.
Peps provide a natural cure
for all sufferers from coughs,
colds, sore or relaxed throat,
bronchitis, laryngitis, difficult

THE
QUESTION of the DAY.
The question of to-day,
of to-morrow and of
every succeeding' day is

more sunset fire seen over the long reaches of the
rarramatta River. Only the music of her voice,
and the honey of her kisses broke the awful, soul-
crusbmg monotony of the everlasting darkness.
Amidst the horror of his blindness stalked the
ghost of the financial problem, with which he
knew Beatrice was struggling. He had embossed
letters placed on the keys of his typewriter, and,
even in the desolation of his darkness, strove to
write tales and impressions of one suddenly
darkeiied for ever. But it was impossible. The
world had gone. It was only a conglomeration of
sounds wild music and haunting refrains. In
the corrosive darkness only the music of her voice
and her kisses remained real.
Taste, touch and sound were all that were left
to him, and the most important of these was the
sense of hearing. Then the insidious, mysterious
affection that had destroyed his sight attacked
his aural nerves. Fear fell upon him. As long
as ho could speak and converse intelligently he felt
he was still a source of some comfort to the girl
he loved. &
I hen sound began to fade, till an ocean of
silence overwhelmed his world, and before him
lay the abomination of black, empty silence.
In his extremity he remembered Negri Sindhia
in response to a letter Negri called to take him to
the Hardens. Was it premonition, or what ? But
Beatrice could hardly bring herself to let them go
without her. He was not gone an hour when she
threw on her hat and jacket and went to the Gar-
dens in search of them.
The loveliness of Sydney’s Gardens grated on
her that afternoon. Suddenly Negri appeared,
staggering like a drunken man, and gripped her
by the arm.
“ A little faintness—they have taken him to
the hospital. He will soon be better ” and he
reeled and fell into a seat.
lell me the worst —what has happened, what
have you done ? ”
Negri shuddered, rocked backwards and for-
wards, and then exclaimed :
“The eyes that longed for light and the ears
that yearned for hearing—in Heaven, Elysium
iNirvana, they shall be satisfied.”
That night it was the Business Man who walked
quietly, without knocking, into Beatrice Ward’s
studio, and found her sitting in a rattan chair, her
hat and gloves on as she had returned from’ the
Gardens and that other place, looking at the
I agan’s picture on the easel before her.
She looked at him like one in a dream. He
drew her arm through his and led her downstairs,
handed her into a cab and drove her away to his
sister’s care.
“ Try and make her cry, Sis; a real, good howl
is the only thing that will save her.”
“He might have lived on for her sake. Men
are horribly selfish,” said his sister two hours
later.
“Bah! You don’t understand. He was real
grit—never thought his sort could have played
the game so well. His insurance policy would
have run out in another fortnight. Now she’ll
get what little he had coming to him.”
“ You are a fool, my brother ! ” said his sister
and turned away to do a “ howl ” herself.
The Business Man went out to think it over
* * * *
The Business Man was patient. He waited
two years, and, after much deliberation, decided
that it was a reasonable period, especially in view
of the fact that the Pagan’s portrait had been
removed from the easel and placed over the fire-
place of her studio.
“ I don’t expect you to love me very wildly
Beatrice. But I’m very fond of you, my dear
girl, and you’re not strong enough to go alone
1 his sort of thing is not good enough ; what you
want now is solid comfort. You can set aside all
scruples. I’ll be proud to have just whatever
love, or respect, or friendship you have for me—
anything, so long as you’ll give me the right to
look after you, and give you the solid comfort you
require. There’s nothing intense or ideal about
me, my girl; just solid comfort. I’ll be as good a
husband to you as I can, and I generally succeed
in most things I try.”
“I’ve been expecting this,” said Beatrice-
‘ b,lt ever y time I have tried to face the subject
my heart has failed, and I have put it off.”
“ I know, I know, my girl— very natural, verv
natural. I don t want to bustle you in any way
my dear. Take a week to consider it. Put senti-
ment out of the matter. You are lonelv, and
this life is not suited to you.”
He stopped and looked up at the Masterpiece.
The blue eyes of the Pagan looked down on him
in that wild intensity, trying to speak. He
rubbed his eyes, and, striding across the room let
the spring-blind up with a bang.
By .Tove, my dear, that’s a wonderful paint-
ing of yours! It seems to be trying to speak, and
yet, there s a dash of the mocker in it. However
to come back to what I was saying, this life is not
suited for you. You’re here alone with these
pictures, and your imagination feeds on ’em till
you’re just a bundle of nerves. My sister is going
up to Leura for a fortnight. Suppose you go up
with her. Shell be delighted with your company,
and then when you come back you can let me
have your answer. Now is that a bargain?”
She agreed—and looked, almost fearfully, at the
Masterpiece to see if it made any sign. But the
light was bad, and the Pagan was only a blur of
paint and brush marks.
The fortnight at Leura did her so much good
that her companion stayed another week, and when
Beatrice returned to town she was a different
woman. She saw the wisdom of accepting the
Business Man. She realised that she was not
strong enough to go alone, and, under the cir-
cumstances, was most fortunate to have such a
suitor. She did not return to her studio home
but stayed with her friend, and when the Busi-
ness Man mentioned the subject she accepted
him.
* * * ,
The Business Man had been obliged to go out
of town, and Beatrice sat in the boudoir, which
was her sanctum sanctorum , with her eyes fixed
on those of the Pagan.
The asbestos fire gleamed tranquilly. Silence
brooded over the place, and Beatrice sat back in
the chair gazing at the portrait of her lost genius.
The red shades on the lights brought back the old
atmosphere, and she felt happier than ever before
during her married life. Down in the drawing-
room someone began to play selections from “II
Trovatore ”on the pianola. She looked round on
her procession of heads, and they seemed to smile
at her. The “Tumult of the Heart” throbbed
out, and there rose before her a vision of that first
day on the Parramatta River—the blaze of sunset
fire, the sky of tender maize green with the great
queen jewel of evening floating in its liquid
depths, and then, afterwards, the Grand Opera.
“ Beatrice! ”
She awoke with a start, for there was reproach
in the voice. Someone had thrown an eider-down
quilt around her and turned out the lights, and
but for the glow of the fire the room had been in
darkness. «Its tranquil refulgence was reflected
by the full-length mirror right on to the face of
the portrait. She felt that the picture had
spoken she was sure she had heard her name
pronounced.
She gazed on the eyes of her lost lover. The
room seemed haunted, the face of the portrait
more terribly in earnest. Every moment she ex-
P e cted to hear the words burst out:
“Why have you been untrue?”
But what need for words? Her own conscience
shrieked the words louder than any human voice
could.
She burst into tears : -
I was so lonely, dear—so lonely. I did not
know what I was doing,” she wailed up to the
P' ctll f e - *' But lam more lonely with him. I
shrink from his touch, and his voice grates so, on
me that I could cry out. But what can I do?

with which he treats me is beyond description,
it i could only come to you. I loathe to live with
him, but have no excuse to leave him. He has
been so kind. Can’t you speak to me for once,
dear, and tell me what to do ? ”
She sobbed awhile, with her head in her hands,
6O , su ddenlv arose, lit the gas, and went to
the desk in which she kept his typewriter. It was
since she had touched it, and she had
difficulty in finding the letters. She felt her
fingers guided as by another hand, and slowly,
with spasmodic efforts, wrote :
My dear Robert,—
1 1 an i n u ot ""grateful. I know that I owe you a life-
ong- debt of gratitude for your tender consideration,
your unceasing kindness, and your care and sympathy in
e terrible hour of my loss. But I cannot live with
jou. xt is quite impossible. It is degradation— not
on your part, but mine. lam that dead man’s wife, and
from the very grave he holds me to him. lam a haunted
woman. His presence fills my room. His picture is
replete with life, and every day it accuses me of my infi-
delity. To-night I heard his voice—only a dream, of
course ; but to me it is real. I am going back to
my studio to earn my own living, to be alone
with my picture and the haunting presence of my
dead genius; and you must not try to take me from it.
~u "i" 0 have been so good will not make me unhappier
than I am by trying to baulk me in this. I cannot go
back on this resolve. You are so good that in yotir dear,
practical wav you will immediately say, “ But what about
money t His works are selling well now, and my
royalty will be quite sufficient to maintain me when I
cannot work. Good-bye, dear friend ; forgive me if I
hurt you a little.—Yours gratefully, Beatrice.
What are you going to do about it ? ” asked
Ins sister, when the Business Man showed her the
letter.
Well, it s a case that neither Shakspeare or
Burns provided for, and I don’t rightly know
what to do. She’s a good woman, and it would
have been all right if I had got her before that
mad writer. It might have been all right if she
had never painted that picture of him—it gave
me the creeps, and I always expected to hear the
damn thing speak. That’s what’s kept his memory
green. It was all so tragic, and the poor girl
wasn t strong enough to stand it. I want you to
go down and see her. Be very gentle with her and
tell her I will agree to all she proposes on one
condition, and that is, that she draws on me—as
a loan only if she likes, interest 4 per cent.—when-
ever she is short of money. That’s all.”
And the Business Mari went out puffins furi-
ously at an unlit cigar.
UNA KIDGELL.
The Horror of the Harbor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I DOZED on the Eleven boat—
The common Mosman ferry ;
I say I dozed—but kindly note
That I was weary, very.
The deck-hand wore an evil scowl,
And oily tresses parted ;
He waited by to loose the howl
With which the boat is started..
A new mouth-organ in his hand
Did glitter like a pistol;
He looked the Hispaniola brand
Of pirate out of Bristol.
And then I must have closed my eyes
And started wildly dreaming ;
The night seemed full of angry cries
And horrid, helpless screaming.
A brutal pirate hurried past
A long, limp lady hauling,
Whilst other captives stood aghast
And shuddered at his bawling.
Blindfolded by the rail I lay
That savage bully hating ;
I heard him howling of some “ Bay ”
Whilst my dread sentence waiting.
Then suddenly I heard a crash,
A horrid yell of “ Hurry ! ”
I saw a light—or cutlass—flash,
And heard a dreadful scurry.
Like frightened sheep along a race,
Towards the plank they started.
Where he stood by with leering face.
And oily tresses parted.
Out from the vessel’s side they shrank
At his relentless bidding,
Along that frail and trembling plank—
Some stumbling and some skidding.
I was the last to drown—or land,
He dragged the plank from under,
And words I could not understand
Roared in a voice of thunder.
The long, limp lady he unwound
(“That there stern line” he called her);
The tireless screw in foam went round
As fast inboard he hauled her.
Upon the wharf with sleep half blind
I tried to solve the riddle ;
Thin music giggled down the wind
Like some old pirate’s fiddle.
At last the sound I recognised—
It came from his mouth-organ ;
I said, “ I would not be surprised
To hear he sailed with Morgan ! ”
AVhen next you venture on the seas
Watch for one darkly leering;
His name is Harry Opftherepleask,”'
His game is buccaneering.
I’m now too old to go a trip,
But from my cliffside arbor
I hear him roaring on his ship—
The Horror of the Harbor.
