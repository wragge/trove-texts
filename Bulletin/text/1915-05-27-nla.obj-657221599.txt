The Red Page
BUTTONS.
I have been watching the war map slammed
up for advertising in front of the news-
paper office.
Buttons—red and yellow buttons—blue and
black buttons —are shoved back and forth
across the map.
A laughing young man, sunny with freckles,
Climbs ladder, yells a jolce to somebody in
the crowd,
And then fixes a yellow button one inch west
And follows the yellow button icith a black
button one inch west.
(Ten thousand men and. boys Heist on their
bodies in a red soak along a river edge,
Gasping of wounds, calling for water, some
rattling death in their throats.)
Who by Christ would guess what it cost to
move two buttons one inch on the war
map here in front of the newspaper office
where the freckle-faced young man is
laughing to us?
—Carl Sandburg, in The Masses.
Conrad
The latest Conrad, Within the Tides
(Dent, per Dymoek’s Library), will not
add a cubit to this master-novelist’s reputa-
tion ; yet this collection of long contes will
have an honorable place in the long, list of
his works. There is apparent an air of
sedateness in his stories; and there is a
certain clumsiness in his literary approach.
In one story Conrad finds his story from
the lips of a man who deliberately gave it to
him because Conrad wrote stories, an intru-
sion Of the machinery of creation that cer-
tainly serves a purpose in allowing Conrad
to indulge himself in his usual oblique
method of narration, but nevertheless an
unnecessarily obvious intrusion. And when
the narrator asks Conrad how his stories
ever come into his head, the legitimate
curiosity of the reader as to Conrad’s
methods remains unsatisfied. “I explained
that one generally got a hint for a tale....
For instance, I 'got myself rowed out to
the rocks the other day. My boatman told
me of *a wreck on those rocks nearly 20
years ago. That could be used as a hint
for a mainly descriptive bit of story with
some such title as ‘ln the Channel,’ for
instance.”
A bald and unconvincing narrative. It
isn’t thus that Conrad gets his plots. They
are rather his vivid memories of his adven-
turous youth, upon which he concentrates
his intensive imagination, his subtle know-
ledge of character and his lucid literary
craftsmanship. And in the same story he
gives us a much more interesting hint of the
writer’s attitude.
One rainy afternoon, oppressed by in-
finite boredom, I went into the smoking-
room. He was sitting there in absolute im-
mobility, which was really fakir-like and
impressive. I began to wonder what could
be the associations of that sort of man, his
milieu, his private connections, his views,
his morality, his friends, and even his wife.
That is evidently the creator’s attitude —
an infinite wonder... .about everybody. An
imaginative reconstruction of the life of any
impressive , stranger even just casually
glimpsed, steadied and sobered by a wide
knowledge of the infinitely varied human
soul. If you have that abiding wonder and
the literary art and the determination to
express it, you may write.
In this ktory, “The Partner,” Conrad
keeps consistently to the point of view of
his narrator; but in another, “The Inn of
the Two Witches,” in which the plot is dis-
covered, crudely, from a manuscript picked
up by chance in a second-hand bookseller’s
shop, Conrad fails to keep within the
limits of his' literary method. The story
begins in the manuscript, but, long before
the end, Conrad’s interest is so great that
he ends the 'story in his own words, with
Ifis own interpretation of his hero, com-
pletely forgetting the original manuscript.
An obvious blunder.
V
Australian readers will be interested to
learn that the plot of the finest of the
stories, “The Planter of Malata,” is set
chiefly in Sydney. And in another story,
“Because of the Dollars,” one of the char-
acters had kept a shop in Sydney. This
character, one of the most sinister in Con-
rad’s long rogues’ gallery, was a Frenchman
without hands.
The very same we used to know in ’79 in
Sydney, keeping a little tobacco shop at the
lower end of George-street. You remember
the huge carcase hunched up behind the
counter, the big white face and the -long
black hair brushed back off a high forehead
like a bard’s. He was always trying to roll
cigarettes on his knee with his stumps, tell-
ing endless yarns of, Polynesia and whining
and cursing in turn mon malheur. His
hands had been blown aWay by a dynamite
cartridge while fishing in some lagoon. This
accident, I believe, had made him more
wicked than before', which is saying a good
deal.
Anybody remember the old gentleman?
And. there is an astonishing reference to
the editor of a Sydney daily:—
They had been feasting, a poet from the
hush, the latest discovery of the editor.
Sneh discoveries were the business, the voca-
tion, the pride and delight of the only apos-
tle of letters in the hemisphere, the solitary
patron of culture, the Slave of the Pamp-
as he subscribed himself at the bottom of the
weekly literary page of his paper... .And
now they had left the poet lying asleep on
the hearth-rug of the editorial room.”
Do editors really do such things in Syd-
ney?
‘‘The Planter of Malata” must be added
to Conrad’s list of great stories. His
heroine is a character after his own heart
—-a beautiful girl worshipped by a brave
man, who, out of his deep love for her,
tangles her and himself <in a knot of fate,
out of which she is, through sheer weakness
of character, unable to extricate herself.
There is a curious bitterness in Conrad’s
analysis of the souls of nearly all the women
in this collection of stories. The wife in
‘‘Because of the Dollars,” an Australian
girl, is a poor bit of ignorant femininity,
but “Laughing Jane,” whose name betrays
her profession recovers, for us, our faith in
feminine humanity. The women in “The
Inn of the Two Witches” are mere degraded
animals.
There are two examples of the gruesome
in this collection; and they show Conrad’s
power of expressing sheer horror at its
undiminished height. The mystery of the
murder in “The Inn of the Two Witches”
has not been surpassed by the best writers
of the detective story; while the atmosphere
of sinister terror about the Frenchman, with
the seven-pound iron weight attached to one
of his wrists, is suggested with diabolical
force. And a of the old Conrad occurs
in the wonderful ending to “The Planter of
Malata.”
Nothing was ever found —and Renouard’s
disappearance remained in the main inex-
plicable. For to whom could it have occurred
that a man would set out calmly to swim
beyond the confines of life—with a steady
stroke—his eyes fixed on a star!
To whom but to Joseph Conrad?
Mutterings of the storm raised by winter-
dreaders in Tasmania are still being heard.
Correspondents are now quoting Knibbs re
the mean winter temperature of Hobart and
Melbourne; and personal recollections of
Antarctic conditions in Tassy and of heat-
waves. in midwinter in Hob,art are still drib-
bling in. The discussion is hereby adjourned
until Mawson fits out an expedition to Tassy
and winters in those Antarctic (or torrid)
regions.
Charles Maclean on the. mawn-dorn con-
troversy : My advice to “L.D.” is that he
should hire Harry Lauder for an hour daily,
and have him repeat, ad lib.: “It’s a braw
day the morn.” I don’t say this would be
a lesson in Fnglisli, but it would convey to
“L.D.” the radical difference between the two
syllables he regards as identical. Further
practice might enable him to recognise that
difference without emphasis. Certainly the
r in morn is weak (probably through associa-
tion with daicn), but can “L.D.” support his
contention with reference to stronger words
of the same class, e.g., scorn, for lorn?
O’er perilous seas'in faery lands forlorn —
Forlorn! the very word is like a bell.
The latter line is ridiculous without the
vibrant r.
But the strongest argument against “L.D.’-’
is this: “L.D.’s” “haw-haw” class plumps for
the “inawn dawn” rhyme. There is a much
larger class (including “Den’s” “Sentimental
Bloke”), which plumps for “morn-dorn,”
and yelps: “What’s the matter with far-
ther?” The rest of us steer between Seylla
and Charybdis without cotton wool in our
ears. (This is mixed mythology, but I
like the illustration.)
“Jean Sibi” on a reported-missing
author: “A weakness for participating iij
alien arguments is alleged to have finished
off Ambrose Bierce, American soldier and
stor-yteller. Bierce, who was a Federal
captain in the Yankee Civil War and was
promoted to major for conspicuous gal-
lantry, butted into the Mexican disturb-
ance over 12 months back and has not
since been reported to anxious relatives and
friends. It is said that he went as a staff-
officer with Huerta’s rag-and-bone army to
tackle Villa at Torreon, and was anony-
mously blotted out in the subsequent melee.
To literary students and toiling story-spin-
ners of the O. Henry school Bierce will be
fondly remembered as a fine specialist in
thrills that are no longer fashionable. He
seemed absorbed in gruesome subjects, and,
as Hugo said of Baudelaire, he ‘created a
new kind of shudder.’ To me the success
of his work was not so much his invention
of the unexpected climax, but the skill with
which he usually concealed any hint of that
ultimate surprise. This literary device,
however, lost some of its effect in any
bound collection of his yarns, for one got
so used to his trick of lying in ambush with
a striking conclusion that the finale , when it
arrived, achieved a fiat and formal triumph.
Some years ago I read ‘The Man and the
Snake, ‘One of the Missing.’ ‘Killed at
Lesaca,’ etc., with a good deal of relish in
American publications, but on their reap-
pearance in a book entitled In the Midst of
Life I was considerably disappointed. Read-
ing the tales together I felt the monotony
of the corpse that popped up automatically
in Bierces trim and tailored prose. Also I
thought the sameness of the psychology an
added shortcoming. Tp my ‘ mind, the
author had taken the psychology of Fear
by the scruff of the neck and had dragged
it through two or three hundred haunted
pages until it screamed for mercy.”
The Boches
Arnold White anxiously asks, Is the Kaiser
Insane? (Pearson; Is. 6d.). The opinion
of this page is that he probably is, but that
his insanity does not matter one single iron
cross. Certainly • the bloke who got these
remarks off his chest would have some diffi-
culty in establishing his - sanity: “The
Almighty will stand by Wilhelm.” “The
spirit of the Lord has descended on me,
because lam the German Emperor.” “I am
the instrument of the Most High. I am His
sword, His representative.” “Woe and death
to those who resist my will! Woe and death
to those who do not believe in my mission !”
“Petish all enemies of the German people!
God requires their destruction. God, who
through my mouth, commands you to exe
cute my will.”
Arnold White shows that this bloke who
scatters “Woes'!” as lavishly as Jeremiah is
brain-tainted by three strains of insanity
and from the medical evidence in the author’s
possession the Kaiser is a paranoiac, that is
a person who suffers from delusional insanity
with a tendency to hallucinations. An alien
ist (naturally British) certifies him as in
sane. He suffers from infantile paralysis
of the left arm, and he has a discharge from
one ear which seems to keep up a chronic
infective meningitis; he is an insane degen
erate of’ homicidal instincts and tendencies
from which there is no hope of recovery
partly on account of his very bad pedigree
but he is not responsible for the manj
crimes and cruelties which he has, committed
But if a lunatic attacks you with an axe the
first thing to do is to take that axe from him :
you can investigate his sanity afterwards —
and at latest reports the lunatic was stil
abroad with his axe. Arnold White’s book
therefore, is no defence against the bran-
dished wood-chopper* but his personal con-
tact with, and knowledge of, the Kaiser gives
the book some topical value. Certainly his
account of the Kaiser’s cunning capture of
the British press, by his invitation to 40
of the leading British editors in 1907, proves
that at least there was more method in Wil-
helm’s madness than in the alleged sanity of
the 40 British editors.
Incidentally, Arnold White informs us
that the Kaiser is under the obsession that
as the eldest son of the eldest child of Queen
Victoria,. the Crown of England is his de
jure. The aim of his life is to secure the
throne of England de facto. But if he were
crowned in Westminster Abbey as William
the Fifth one feels he would not long reign
over us happy and glorious. “Empires are
not made *in Germany.” “The soil of Aus-
tralia was handed over by Britain to numer-
ous Australian Governments, a proceeding
which excited absolute derision in Berlin.
But was it foolish? The Emden w r as de-
stroyed by an Australian cruiser... .After
the Boer War it was intended, stipulated and
desired that a sum of £30,000,000 should be
repaid to the British Exchequer by the great
cosmopolitan gold interests in the Transvaal.
Nothing was repaid ; not a penny. And again
the men round the Kaiser were filled with
contempt for our British policy. Were we
idiots?. .. .Berlin was, and is, unable to
understand the success of British policy in
India and the Dominions.... The Emperor
Wilhelm has welded for Great Britain an
alliance with Canada, Australia, Maoriland
and South Africa. No Acts of Parlia-
ment could have done that. . . .The Emperor
Wilhelm’s madness has done for us British
what we could never have done for ourselves.”
&
The works of Heinrich von Treitschke are
now being hurriedly translated into English
-—2 O years too late. The first volufne of
selections from this inspirer of the gospel of
hatred of • the English is titled Germany,
France, Russia and Islam (Jarrold, per
Dymock’s Library), and the articles, most of
which are undated, include “What We De-
mand from France” and “Gerniany and the
Oriental Question.” The lack of an intro-
ductory note leaves the reader a little at a
loss as to the bearings of these selections
upon ‘ the whole work of this biased his-
torian. Amid his outpourings of contempt
upon tlie English he makes, for instance, the
curious unconscious forecast that “the nation
still exhibits powerful energy in the splendid
achievement of its social life, and it might
easily happen again that, should she believe
herself imperilled in her vital commercial
interests, she will yet stagger humanity by
bold determination.” Also, he frequently
becomes unconsciously, that is, Germanly,
humorous. “England is to-day the shameless
champion of barbarism in international law.”
&
The question asked, and lucidly answered,
by Philip Whitwell Wilson in The Unmaking
of Europe (Nisbet, 3s. Gd.) is: “How does
all this sacrifice of blood and treasure affect
the life of nations, their finances, their ideals,
their religions, their institutions?” His book
is an admirably-written history of the first
six months of the war. It is not history-in-
a-hurry ; but a carefully compiled account of
the broad features of the struggle, compre-
hensively envisaged. Thus, he aptly reminds
us that:—
“In its broad and cruel sweep, the war of
3914 was, in the jargon of the time, a super-
siege. The anguish of beleaguerment which
fell upon the cities of Jerusalem and Baby-
lon, on Constantinople, Paris and Strassburg
now threatened the two vast Empires which
covered. mid-Europe. The onrush of six
armies, into France, the bloody conflicts on
the Drina, the desperate counterblow in East
Prussia against Rennenkampf and his ad-
vancing Cossacks, were sorties against the
natural entrenchments which encircled the
Teutonic territories. Yet by beating the
Belgians to Antwerp, and by pressing her
lines to the very gates of Paris. Germany did
not set herself free. .. .Germany was con-
scious that the siege which her people were
enduring, like all sieges, must succeed, if it
be obstinately maintained. By’ land and by
sea she was almost as isolated as Kiao-Chou,
surrounded by the Japanese. ...Anp when
Germany invested Antwerp she closed that
useful port not against the Allies, who were
independent of neutral ports, but against her-
self. She strengthened the very blockade
from which she must suffer so severely.
Every mile of neutral coast was an asset to
Germany, and Belgium would have been
more useful as a neutral than as a fighting
Ally, or as a conquered province.”
And Wilson rightly stresses the profound
reflection on the prestige of Germany shown
by the rush of Germans, resident in Eng-
land, to change their names. The Germans
were the only people who thus repudiated
their country. We have seen, too, in Aus-
tralia, this sudden desire to cast off their
Germanism shown by German-Australians.
He draws a pen-picture of what the capture
of Paris by the Boches would have meant.
“What the fate of the civil population would
have been we can only conjecture; but it is
probable that by deliberate acts of policy,
they would have been humbled to the dust,
looted, blackmailed, and subjected to every
refinement of provocative insult... .Leading
citizens would have been arrested. Thousands
of able-bodied men would.have'been trans-
ported to ‘slavery’, under German task-
masters. And for generations to come, such
hate would have been engendered as no ex-
piation could have wiped out. .. .Most pos-
sibly the French themselves would have had
to recapture their own capital after a bom-
bardment which would have inflicted yet
further damage, or, worse still, the explosion
of mines, laid for revenge as in Brussels,
under all the public buildings of the metropo-
lis.”
The chapter dealing with finance lets us
see what a stupendous gamble is Germany’s
method of financing the war. When Ger-
many is defeated after, a war that will in-
evitably be long and costly, her economic
collapse is certain. There will come a time
when even Germany will discover that “in
arithmetic, at any rate, there is no special
rule, no divine immunity for the Father-
land.” v •>:,
The author promises us a second volume
dealing with the succeeding half-yes’- of the
war. We can promise that it will be well
worth reading. 7
M. E. Clarke gives us in Paris Waits,
1914 (Smith, Elder, per Dymock’s Li-
brary), a vivid picture of life in the days
of anxiety when the grey armies of the
locusts were apparently irresistibly sweep-
ing upon that fair city. It is evident from
this faithful record of an Englishwoman
that beneath the surface frivolity of the
Parisians there is a courage and a capacity
of heroic endurance which the world has
hitherto not been allowed to see—probably
because for it the world did not trouble to
look. “The extraordinary calm of the city
under the test of imminent investment,
under the trial of an exodus that was
almost a panic, under the test of pessimistic
rumors and no official news that can be
called good, is simply marvellous Even
if the city had been sacked, even if it yet
be sacked, burned or invested peacefully,
the “people” must stand steady or cause yet
greater disaster. That it will stand, and
very steadily, there is very little doubt, and
to its attitude the whole civilised world will
pay tribute.” The author mentions, too,
an interesting psychological detail of the
demeanor of the Belgian citizens as they
sullenly watched the invading armies of
the Hun stream through their capital. “Only
once did the nerves of the people break, and
that was in an unexpected way. Suddenly
a German officer gave the word for the
goose step, and as the men broke into this
fantastic exhibition, the irrepressible Bel-
gians broke into fits of merriment. They
laughed till they cried, they rolled on the
ground, they held their sides, and nothing
would stop them. After such a strain as
they had experienced before the reaction
was necessarily violent.”
, This picture, too, of + h e British soldier, as
he appears to the French, is. interesting:
“He likes tea, and drinks it all day long; he
almost lives on jam and biscuits, and his
chief recreation l is nor sport but shaving.
His cleanliness, his tidiness and his domestic
habits are much more talked about than his
bravery or his fine soldierly attributes....
His gaiety, sang-froid, and habit of singing
are also much commented upon. ‘Whenever
you hear singing and laughter, you may be
sure it is the English Army; and the greater
the difficulty the louder the singing.’ ”

Nervy' tad Rundown
New Health for the Weak
and the Ailing.
Th ere is nothing to equal “Wincarnis”
lor Anaemia, Weakness, Nerve
I roubles, Sleeplessness, Weariness,
Indigestion or that “Run-down” feel-
ing because “ Wincarnis” is a Tonic, a
Restorative, a Blood-maker and a
Nerve Food —all in one. It is recom-
mended by over 1.0,000 Doctors.
And it is the only wine tonic of any
repute that does not contain drags.
You really ought to try it.
Old 'Englesb Proverb illustrated No. L
“One good torn deeerre* another."
Are you Weak?
Do you. feel incapable of exer-
tion ? Does your work exhaust
you? Do you feel intensely
weary in all your limbs? If
so, take “Wincarnis” three
times a day, and it will give
you new strength and new
vigor. And each day more
strength and more vigor, until,
step by step, it rebuilds your
weakened constitution and re-
creates your lost vitality.
Arc you “Nervy”?
Do you jump at a sudden
sound ? Do you feel irritable ?
Are you nervous ? Do you get
headaches ? Do you have neur-
algia? Do you suffer from
nervous debility? That is be-
cause your nerves want “ton-
ing up.” You need a short
course of “Wincarnis.” “Win-
carnis” is a powerful nerve
builder which acts directly
upon the nerve centres and
thus transmits new vigor and
and new life to the nerves all
over the body.
Are you Anaemic?
Is your face white? Are your
lips and gums bloodless ? Are
your eyes dull? Does your
heart palpitate? If so, you
need “Wincarnis” to fill your
veins with new, rich, red blood.
Take ‘Wincarnis” three times
a day. You will feel better
from even the first wineglass-
ful—i rou will feel the neAV, rich
blood dancing through your
veins like a stream of new life.
Arc you Run-down?
Do you feel listless, low-
spirited and weary of every-
thing ? Do you find your
work irksome and your recrea-
tion exhausting? If so, you
are “Run-down” and “out-of-
sorts.” But a few doses of
“Wincarnis” will quickly put
you right. Take a wineglass-
ful of “Wincarnis” in the
middle of the morning, and
another the last thing at night.
You will be delie-hted with
the new vigor and new vitality
it will give you.

Night.
Night crept over the hills.
Wrapt in a purple shroud.
The fire fled from the sunset cloud.
As wan eyes pale
’Neath a twilit veil,
Night crept over the hills.
Night came into the city;
With a wanton tilt to her lips,
Swiftly she sped on swaying hips,
Slim lithe feet and ankles bare;
Strange bright gems in her dusky hair.
Night came into the city.
Night stole over the plains,
’Neath stars as white as death.
The wind was hushed to a zephyr’s breath.
Where foot of man had never trod.
Night stole over the plains,
Filled with the peace of God.

Roads of the Dawn.
You are bound for the dawn,
O big, brave steamer,
Moving out in the darkness dim,
With white wake flung, like a snowy
streamer,
Loosed to the winds at a sea-maid’s whim.
You are taking the road that my heart
has travelled,
Choosing a path by sun and star,
From Ocean’s tangle of tracks unravelled,
That leads to the dawn, where the Three
Kings are.
Clear in its light, you will see them stand-
ing,
Shoulder-deep, in the sea’s dark blue,
And hear the breakers that seek a landing.
Shouting a throated word to you.
The saffron lights in the mists may weaken,
But, high and far, on a headland’s brow,
The white, clear star of Maria’s beacon
Will show you a way for your driving
prow.
Y r ou’ll steer by that star, O big, black
steamer,
And come to a dawn-road sweet and cool,
Where fairy islands enchant the dreamer,
And seas are calm as a naiad’s pool;
Where the Sail Rock looms like a schooner
dreaming.
Where the Poor Knights kneel in the
purple swell,
And winds breathe soft, in the silence, seem-
ing
Faint ivith the notes of a lost ship’s bell.
Yon will sail and sail, 0 strong, swift
steamer,
Over this dawn-road, rich and rare,
And your wake will float, like a wind-blown
streamer
Loosed from the touch of a sea-maid’s
hair;
Till, at the dusk, like a sea-bird homing
Into the hill-girt port you’ll steer,
Where skies are grey, in the southern gloam-
ing,
And lights of a city glimmer clear.
Lights of a city and ferries moving!
Shadowy gleams on a silent tide!
What are these things to a heart that’s rov-
ing
Out and away o’er the waters wide?
O Roads of the Dawn, that are lit with
wonder,
Whose dreamy portals the Three Kings
hold,
I see your slow swells burst’in thunder,
Filling the world with their living goldcf

She’s given up her home folk, her husband
and her friends,
She’s shut down on her old life, and left
it all for me.
I talked her into doing it, and this is how
it ends:
We’re steaming out to London,
To far-off London—
Australia is left far behind for all eter-
nity.
She’ll never see Kerang again, nor wateh the
sun at night
Sink down in flaming glory by the gum-
trees on the rise,
Nor see the stars which make the Cross come
shining into sight.
She’ll miss them all in London,
In fog-bound London,
And she’s thinking of it, maybe—there’s
a cloud across her eyes.
And now I have her here with me, and I
know I’ve won the game,
There’s a feeling that comes crawling,
and I can’t get rid of it;
The glamor has departed, and the whole
affair seems tame,
Now we’re drawing in to London,
To unknown London;
I’ve got what I was after, and I want it
—not a bit.
But she’s given up her home folk, herself
and all her friends,
She’s shut down on the old life, and all
because of me.
I talked her into doing it, and this is how T
it ends:
We’ve settled here in London,
In cold, grey London—
And I hate the sight of her, but I must
never let her see.

THE VOLUNTARY SYSTEM OF
DEFENCE.
Lord Haldane, an arch-opponent of compul-
sory service in Britain, hinted last week that
unless something vast, though unspecified,
happened the old order would have to go.
This, taken in conjunction with the view of
most of the experts —including Kitchener
—that the war will be a long one, suggests
that the foolish old policy of the British
Liberal party is doomed. Not that either
that party or John Bull has consistently
stuck to the voluntary method of getting men
for the army and navy. That, indeed, is a
comparatively modern notion dating from the
period of Cobden, who argued that the surest
way for any nation to lead the world was to
present to it a completely defenceless front,
both military and commercial. Before that
time Britain had frequently had compulsory
service in one form or another —as often, in
fact, as the nation had been seriously
threatened. But it was always either in-
equitable or ill-judged compulsion; and
mostly it was both. Towards the end of the
18th century all the rogues and vagabonds
were forced to join the colors. An extra-
ordinary collection of cripples, criminals and
degenerates was thus harvested, _ to the
annoyance of the regular army, which made
a point of losing the outcasts as fast
as the recruiting bands found them. The
finest of Cromwell’s armies were formed by
compulsion. Every centre throughout the
kingdom had to contribute its quota of uni-
formed soldiers of a fighting age. Compul-
sory service was not regarded as un-English
in those days, when England’s prestige stood
as high as it has ever done in history. The
Press Gang system, which was simply _ a
sloppy and ill-organised variety of conscrip-
tion, obtained off and on from the Eliza-
bethan epoch, when England was threatened
by the Armada, down to the beginning of the
19th century, when the French navy had to
be dealt with. From the fall of Napoleon
to the present day the inviolability of Britain
has not been threatened, and British sailors
have consequently been able to sing that they
never would be slaves without the danger' of
having to argue the point with cynical
foreigners. The only real difference between
the naval conscription which Britain knew
repeatedly between the beginning of the 16th
and the middle of the 19th century, and
that form of conscription which is in force
on the European continent to-day, lies
in the fact that under the old British system
the liability was practically for life (from
IS to 45), while under the modern arrange-
ment it is for comparatively few years.
The voluntary system of -raising armies has
been a more or less complete failure
everywhere; and it always must. be. In
times of peace, it gets the unemployables,
and as a result a social stigma is cast oh the
military profession which debars many good
citizens with a taste for soldiering from
joining it. So often as times are prosperous
and there is plenty of work going, the re-
cruiting sergeants have difficulty in getting
anyone at all. Thus one always finds a dis-
parity between the nominal Establishment
and the actual strength of a volunteer army;
and when, as often happens, there is added to
the natural disparity caused by slack recruit-
ing that disparity which is the outcome of a
pacifist or parsimonious Government, the re-
sults from a Defence standpoint are awful.
In Britain, in the year before the Great War
began—a war in which efficient artillery and
lots of it has proved of paramount import-
ance—big reductions in both the Peace and
War Establishments of the field and horse
artillery occurred. At the beginning of
1913, chiefly on a point of economy, six
brigades of field artillery were re-constituted
as six two-battery reserve brigades—which
meant the disbandment of six field artillery
batteries. Several horse artillery batteries
were disbanded shortly afterwards, partly,
it was said, for lack of men, partly because
of a shortage of suitable horses; and the
total result must have been highly grati-
fying to the Germans when the present
trouble started. The United States volunteer
army is a jest—so much of a jest that it
was recently found impotent to quell a
“greaser” revolution in Mexico—and it is so
regarded by most intelligent Yankees. The
volunteer U.S. Navy has seven battleships in
reserve. Each of them needs seven or eight
hundred men to constitute its crew. There
is, so far, not a single sailor available for
this purpose. According to the New York
Times (28/3/T5) : “We [the U.S.] are
short 339 officers and 5219 men even to fill
up the complements of the 21 battleships of
our first line.” Australia’s old-time volun-
teer army was almost as futile as its hired
fleet. The British volunteer army, of
August last, chastened by the agonies and
humiliations of the Boer War, was a highly
creditable machine —for its size. But it was
not nearly big enough to save Belgium, and
it is doubtful if it could have saved Eng-
land had the Germans succeeded in fluking a
landing at the beginning of the carnage.
The new armies with which the British
Empire is fighting are, of course, not volun-
teer armies at all in the true sense of the
term. They are made up of ethical con-
scripts—of men who are obeying a moral in-
stead of a legal obligation to defend their
native land. They represent the Briton’s
customary slipshod and unscientific method
of approaching serious trouble. The only
essential difference between the press gangs
of 1915 (whose units are the papers, the
stage, the hoardings and the women) and
those of the Georgian era lies in the fact that
whereas the old arrangement roped in the
worst, the present one secures the best. Not
necessarily the best for fighting purposes
(the ranks, all over the Empire, are full of
intellectuals without half the physical vigor
or stamina of many dullards, who are staying
woodenly at home), but the best as regards
public spirit and imagination—in short, the
men whose lives the nation can least spare.
This fact makes the volunteer system, which
is merely futile in time of peace, a crime and
a national tragedy when a big war is in pro-
gress. Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy,
France, all the' countries with which we
shall have to compete commercially after the
present struggle, are at least striking an
average in the matter of their losses. They
are sending the cream of their young men, but
they ape giving them a chance to survive by
leavening their masses with citizens who do
not matter so much to future generations.
In Britain and the Dominions the brightest
and bravest spirits are encouraged to immo-
late themselves; the recreants and those who
are too senseless to realise what is at stake
remain behind. It may have no effect on the
issue of the war. A budding Lister, or a
Marconi in embryo, may shoot as straight as
a stay-at-home pugilist or footballer. But it
is going to have a serious effect on the issue
of the trade war which must begin as soon as
Armageddon ends.
In justice to the best of our youth, and in
justice to those who are to come after us, the
voluntary system ought to go. It isn’t even
proving entirely effective in a recruiting sense
with the war in what appears to be its open-
ing stages—that is to say, before the German
offensive has been broken. Kitchener has
just had to make an appeal for 300,000 men,
at a time when the world’s generals are think-
ing in millions. Appeals for volunteers are
increasing in other quarters. They are re-
sponsible for a tremendous waste of energy
and time and money, and there would be no
need for them if a political dogma, which has
no more practical sense or logic at the back of
it than Freetrade, did not require to be but-
tressed up. There are at least two imme-
diate and urgent arguments in favor of insti-
tuting universal service throughout the white
population of the Empire. One is that the
war must thereby be ended sooner; and the
earlier the war is ended the better for every-
one. The other is that the British Empire
ought to have a formidable army, as well as
a fleet, when peace-terms come to be discussed
at Berlin. But of all the indictments
against the voluntary system, that which
charges it with making an undue drain on
the country’s best is the deadliest. A great
nation can endure the most shattering blows ;
it may be bankrupted of gold and drenched
with blood; it will still arise and prevail
once more so long as it is left the right
stock to breed from.
POLITICIANS WHO WOULD BORROW
AT THE CANNON’S MOUTH.
Apparently State Governments are as in-
ured to shame as those bottle-nosed cadgers
who infest the city parks whining for the
equivalent of beer. Certainly if they had
respect for themselves or for the Empire or
for Australia’s dignity they would not now,
in an hour when the people of their race are
struggling for existence—when the Empire
is fighting by land and sea against a formid-
able, unscrupulous enemy—be sitting down
on the outskirts of things meaning about
their own alleged little necessities and beg-
ging for the diversion of some of the funds
available for the life-and-death war. Having
no other desire than to keep themselves and
their own small coteries comfortable, Minis-
ters of States possessing vast resources, in
which almost all man’s reasonable require-
ments can be produced with relative ease,
and whose allurements as fields for immigra-
tion have been trumpeted at a thousand ban-
quets—these sturdy beggars are proclaiming
to the world that Australia is a place in-
habited by people unable to keep afloat un-
less supported by a steady stream of loans.
* * * *
In the five years from 1904 the State bor-
rowings jumped £23,000,000; in the last five
years they leaped upwards £50,000,000. And
the particularly shocking feature of it all is
that the heaping-up of debt (and the inci-
dental expansion of the parasitical classes)
has been most marked where Labor has been
in power. Labor’s birth as a political force
was largely a revolt against the borrowing
folly of a bygone day. Yet in comparison
with the demented plunging of these later
years the old-time lunacy was enlightened
sanity. It was certainly directed by
a more reasonable conception of the
meaning of debt. The excuse put
forward in past times for handing
the p.n. to Cohen was that the money
was necessary for indispensable works of
development. The modern buccaneers have
gone far beyond this. For a time they talked
the old gag about the national resources, and
they continued touching Cohen for the cash
to erect a culvert at Dead Dog and a police
station at Letergobilly. But as the scandal
of waste grew and questions came to be
asked about how much more developing on
p.n.’s was contemplated, the necessity arose
for a fresh set of phrases. Stripped of de-
coration these amount to a confession that
Ministries have been borrowing not because
of the imperious need of the works under-
taken, but for these wholly different reasons :
(1) That unless the State borrows, the
people will be out of a job; (2) that bor-
rowing is essential to the maintenance of
existing legislation for the control of indus-
try and wages. So the population has this
proposition before it: Australians can only
get work by grace of the foreign money-
lender, and the selling of their country into
bondage is the price they must pay for the
prevention of sweating. It is a very beau-
tiful proposition, reminiscent mostly of the
opium-eater.
* * * *
In a sense, of course, the cynical admis-
sion of the Borrowing politicians has much
truth in it. They have gone on borrowing
year after year as the most convenient way
of evading their obligations, creating thereby
a bogus prosperity, administering public
affairs and legislating on the basis of their
bubble, and finding that the further they
floundered into debt the further they were
driven. That an end had to come to the
tragedy must have been obvious even to
themselves. The Gadarene swine had a
cold bath at the finish of their exhilarating
slide. Australians are getting tlieir douch
now when they see their Governments like
so many Binghis pleading for tikapenny—
sneaking into the London money market by
the side door; shouting from the housetops
that John Bull, in addition to the gigantic
financial task of holding up his own and
other armies in the field, must come to
the. rescue of poor, out-of-work relations
stranded in a place called Australia. Some
of the more insolently impenitent borrowers
have even been heard at times talking about
“the unparalleled conditions created by the
war,” their object being to give the public the
idea that the continuation of the jamboree
has some mysterious relation to the business
of carving up the Hun. What has N. S.
Wales to do with the war? Nothing! The
nearest approach it has to war is the ven-
detta between David Hall and Cab-
MICHAEL. What struggle is Victoria waging,
or where is Jack Scaddan engaging the
foe? The nearest war is 5000 miles
away; there is not a hostile cruiser on the
ocean; there has been no serious interrup-
tion to the flow of the nation’s trade ashore
or afloat —except as to that small part which
by characteristic fatuity was being diverted
to an enemy country. The .war has nothing to
do with the States’- borrowings. Their
gluttonous thirst for loans to-day is merely
the sequence to. their over-indulgence yes-
terday. The curse to Australia has been the
facility with which the politicians have been
able to raise the loans; but. as it has pos-
sibly occurred to the British Government
that the war is of more importance than the
neglected bridge in Queensland, or the con-
tinued employment of Holman’s political
friends on a Government job at the old boom
rates of pay, it is not at all unlikely that
the polite request of a few months ago to
keep off . the mat may change into a series
of brief observations about ‘ patriotism and
decency. The sooner they come the better.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Italy Wearies of Being “Unredeemed.”
After- nine long months of waiting, the
Italian threw his feathered hat on the floor
last week, and came in on the side of the
Allies. He brings an army of at least
1,000,000 useful fighters, on whose equip-
ment he has just spent £50,000,000, and one
of the world’s greatest navies. But apart
from that, the advantages of his arrival in
the arena are inestimable. Ever since the
war started, Austria has been getting copper,
iron, coffee and cotton direct from Northern
Italy. Germany not only got supplies from
Italy through Austria, but was able to use
Italy’s neutrality to make that country a
conduit pipe between the outside world and
Switzerland. Contraband was sent through
Italy to the German cantons of the
little Republic, and there seized by
the Kaiser’s emissaries without protest
from the nominal consignees. That class
of business is now at an end. Finally,
there is the strong moral effect. Here
is a nation which ought to know how
the war is going putting its money on the
Allies. This must be the most powerful of
arguments to those countries which hate to
jump till they are sure which is the best
side of the fence to land. Italy was doing
well out of peace, but it will certainly do
better in the long run out of war. Besides,
it has a score of vast size and venerable age
to pay off against Austria. When Austria
gained Bosnia-llerzegovina at. the Congress
of Berlin, it achieved a possession as fatal as
Alsace-Lorraine has been to Germany. The
Lost Provinces ensured a war of revenge in
France, and what one may call the Bilked
Provinces did the same in Italy. “Italy Un-
redeemed” has been the rallying cry for all
classes of Italians during the past 35 years,
and by the present look of things the Irre-
dentists are going to get as much as they
expected in their most sanguine imaginings.
What the distracted Austrian Government
was prepared to pay for peace was the
Italian Trentino. What Italy, knowing the
strength of its hand, asked for was most of
the Southern Tyrol, Trieste, Istria and the
best of the Dalmatian Islands between
Fiume and Ragusa. It will pay the Allies,
and more particularly Britain, to encourage
the party making these demands. The master-
object is to slay the world’s burglar and his
accomplice. A long step in that direction
will have been taken when Austria is trans-
formed into an over-sized Servia, by the
practical confiscation of its sea-coast. By
this move Germany, whose outlet to the
North Sea is already poor, will be shut off
entirely from the sea to the East. This will
be all to the benefit of those Powers which
own dominions and dependencies and things
and don’t want them stolen in the name of
Culture.
Out Goes the Butterman!
The Continuous Ministry in Queensland has
gone at last. Mainly through errors in
tactics, the Labor party has' never until
now had a look-in since Anderson Dawson
formed his Sudden Ministry in 1899, and
that in a State where Labor has for years
been able to secure almost the entire Federal
representation. On this occasion its oppo-
nents had two serious defects. In the first
place they had no commanding personality
in the front; and in the second place such
leaders as they had were middlemen in pri-
vate life. The first defect is, a serious
handicap at any time; the second is par-
ticularly serious at a time when the cost
of living is exceptionally high. As against
the lack of personality on the side of the
Liberals the Labor party was extremely
fortunate in its leader, T. J. Ryan, a bar-
rister of exceptional quality on the platform,
and his deputy, E. G. Theodore, a skilful
tactician. Whatever chances the Denham
Government may have had were further
reduced by the defection of J. G.. Appel,
one of its most capable Ministers, and his
frank remarks concerning the mediocrity of
his former chief. Nor did the still more
recent death of A- H. Barlow do his old
side any good; for though Barlow ; wa§, a
venerable anachronism, who did not 1 repre-
sent one Bananalander in 50, he had his
value as a shrewd vote-catcher. But not
Appel and Barlow put together and multi
plied by two could have saved the middle
men. Their record was not good enough.
Man for man it was plain that the Labor-
ites possessed the greater natural ability;
and the fact that Andrew Fisher, a
Bananalander, can lead a Labor Govern-
ment and do fine national work at a time
when there is more work to do than ever
there was before, killed stoneM«%j|%e old
prejudice against trusting Labor with power
and responsibility. Northern Liberals -might
point out, as of course they did, that 'Hol-
man had been a political wild-cat in; N,. S.
Wales; but his bad record was wiped' out
by the remembrance of the much more satis-
factory performance of a Federal Prime
Minister drawn from the Labor ranks within
the Northern State itself. Whether Ryan’s
successful return from a campaign fought
very largely on a question of high prices will
be followed by low prices, remains to be
seen. If it is', Ryan won’t be much of a
blessing. Queensland doesn’t want low
prices. Low prices don’t suit the producer;
and more than any other State in Australia
Queensland is a producer. The don’t-jvorks ;
who live on their means, move South.
Nevertheless, so far as Ryan and hi£ fol-
lowers can reduce prices by cutting out the
middleman and otherwise lowering the cost
of marketing, they will do excellent service.
Incidentally, they will do precisely the
opposite to what the Labor Government in
N. S. Wales has done. That painful acci-
dent or gang or whatever it is first covertly
and of late openly rooked the country pro-
ducer -for the benefit of the horde of para-
sites which hang on to the bloased cities. A
Government which will turn that policy: com-
pletely upside down and make things easier
Responsibility.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They will be held personally responsible.
—Foreign Office note to Turkey.
Not the soldier in the ranks
Who goes with murder in his eye,
Who owns no law and earns no thanks,
Shall answer when the bugles cry
The peace of Truth our guns shall win.
The hellish thing you bade him do
Stands on the record charged to you,
The leader of his sin.
This is War; and Justice hides
In shadows of the battle smoke.
But that large sword of hers abides,
And you for every law you broke
Shall answer in the court of man.
The tortured babe, the mother’s pain,
The cry for mercy raised in vain,
Shall place you ’neatli the ban.
While the fires of Ileli are hot
You spurn remorse and know no shame!
When guns are cold the war’s last shot
Shall leave you burdened with the blame.
No longer leagued in battle strong,
You stand to face the thing you wrought
Alone, by bitter knowledge taught
That hempen ropes are long.

for the country producer will do the biggest
work that awaits the doing in Australian
State politics. It will have clods thrown
at it by many of its own suburban sup-
porters who now benefit by the robbery of
the country toiler. But that shouldn’t
turn it aside. If it is out to benefit the
producer it must be prepared to butt up
against the middleman’s clerk as well as the
middleman himself. It won’t benefit the
producer at all by providing that the
middleman’s clerk gets another 10 shillings
a week.
The Frantic Anxiety to Shut-up the
Universe.
Ever since the march from Tipperary com-
menced the voice of the man who wants to
shut up something has been raised in dismal
pleading. How many of these well-meaning
zealots there are in the land it is impossible
to determine; but judging by the number of
their wails the. shut-up disease has made
fairly rapid progress. First there was the
yell to shut Parliaments; since then there
have been more yells demanding that, even
though Parliaments are kept open, members
should shut down on work. There have been
howls for shutting up pubs, and shutting
up theatres, and racecourses, and stadiums,
and football grounds, and golf courses, and
German clubs (good howl that), and alien
enemies (another good howl), and trade
between the States, and canteens, and pic-
ture-shows, and bowling greens, Socialists
who let off gas in the streets, and fruit
shops on Sundays, and billiard rooms, and
newspapers which print news within six
months of its being known to the enemy, and
fish markets, and fruit barrows, and cockies
who won’t sell their wheat. Whenever, in
fact, anything or any place is publicly men-
tioned, someone immediately bawls “Shut it
up!” on the alleged ground that the thing
or place is a national peril in time of war
because it interferes with enlistment. That
a very large section of the community
must in any case stay on in the publess,
shut-up Australia —the men because of the
work they have to do, or because their hair
is falling out or they suffer from
gout or have disputes with the wages
board or income-tax commissioners, and
all the women who will or won’t
knit socks and make pyjamas—never seems
to occur to these advocates of a general
closing. The man who measures 75 inches
round the waist may still want a seat in the
stalls without being guilty of disloyalty;
the old party who disports himself on the
links would only be made miserable by the
forfeiture of the implements he pays to have
carried over the bunkers that he may hit a
little ball with one of them now and again.
But the shut-up brigade would close down
on him and everyone else, and for the period
of the war make the earth an apple-less, dis-
mal Eden, from which the matinee and the
“queen of the movies” would be driven with
contumely. Then when the fight was over
the shut-up specialists would fight like cats
to keep the closed door shut hard and fast.
They’re a dismal, unimaginative lot. But
there is one thing they won’t shut on any
terms, and that is their own collective
mouth. Requests to start there are met
with violent language about liberty of
speech. There also happen to be a certain
liberty of choice and a certain liberty of
movements, which are also matters requir-
ing defence.

The Destruction of a Political Joss.
What a satire this reconstruction of the
British Ministry is on Party Government —
what a revelation of the danger of sys-
tematically shoving round pegs into square
holes, merely because the pegs have been
useful in the wire-pulling associated with a
general election! Of course the ancient
fraud is not believed in seriously nowadays
by anyone—even its most noisy supporters
gravely mistrust the thing—and when in
August of last year the bugles sounded over
Europe, John Bull threw it from him like
a snake. Kitchener went to the War Office
as Minister, not because he was a
Tory, or a Freetrader, or a Radical,
or anything else in the way of a
party barracker, but because in the judgment
of Parliament he was the best man for the
job immediately on hand. In this time of
crisis, when the nation couldn’t afford to
practise the old humbug, no one suggested
that Smith or Jones or Robinson, who had
been making effective party appeals from the
cart-tail on behalf of the party in power,
should handle the military situation. To
have done so would have been to challenge
derision. For a while the Administration
carried on without division of party; but
there were still partisans in places of high
responsibility merely because they were narti-
sans of pushful fibre ; and when the machine
began to creak so loudly as to disturb the
public in its sleep—when matters in rela-
tion to the navy, to recruiting, to the in-
dustrial position, and particularly in relation
to the manufacture of war munitions,
clamored for more intelligent handling—the
considerations which impelled the Cabinet to
make Kitchener a Minister forced the poli-
ticians to once again jump on the party Joss.
The changes announced during the last few
days are epoch-making; for they do not
represent a coalition, or fusion, or any of
those other devices adopted by poli-
ticians to save the skins of a party or group
of partisans. Their meaning is that in the
"hour of trouble Party Government is as
sinister a danger to the nation as the presence
of a regiment of enemy spies. And it will occur
to the public that the boat that crumples up
when the wind begins to blow is a mighty
unsafe sort of craft to be afloat in during a
calm. To. Australians, with their own na-
tional life to consider and a disastrous crop
of political humbug ripening in each summer’s
sun, the collapse of the dilapidated party
scarecrow in Britain is at once n. warning
and a signal.
4.
When the Bill Goes In.
As long as Britain refrained from even
whispering a word about “renrisals,” the
German Government was content to utter
threats of what it was going to do. But as
sopn as the sinking of the Lusitania had
made things unpleasant for Germans abroad.
the Hun Government talked of horrors which
had already come to pass. It announced
officially, for instance, that typhus fever was
epidemic in 10 of the camps of British and
Indian prisoners in Germany. What pro-
portion of those unfortunate thousands are
going to be sent back to Britain in due
course? And what will be the condition of
the survivors when they return? These are
questions of most vital importance to Ger-
mans in English-speaking countries; but
they don’t realise its importance—yet. What
they had better start reflecting on straight
away is that they will be tolerated or not
tolerated in the future according to the
measure of humanity which the Fatherland
has shown to British prisoners and interned
citizens. It is up to the Hun abroad, then,
to pray hard for the health of the British in
the hands of the Hun at home. For nothing
is sm-er than that public opinion of Ger-
mans abroad will be shaped by authentic
records of German vindictiveness at home.
The Importing Disease in a New Form.
Foreign trader though he is, Senator
Millen showed himself a good Australian
in combating the State Premiers’ proposal
to co-operate with the Federal Government
in despatching skilled mechanics to Britain
to help manufacture war material. It is
not only economically unsound —it is
treachery to the Commonwealth to send
away men who, not being soldiers, can as
effectively assist the country and the Em-
pire while stopping here as by going a long
voyage. No country has so many rifles and
so much ammunition at present that it
couldn’t very well do with more; yet the
Lithgow factory is working only one shift,
with a trifle of overtime. Before skilled
mechanics are exported not only the Lith-
gow factory but those at Maribyrnong and
Braybrook for the making of ammunition
should be working three full shifts and
despatching the to where they are
so badly needed. The reason thus far ad-
vanced for not working Lithgow factory at
least two shifts is the scarcity of trained
men, and you don’t make them less scarce
by exporting them. The State Insects’ idea
is merely a variant of the old “stall” that
everything must come from England, the
Australian being a poor, futile, wood-and-
water joey. But for that monstrous obses-
sion we should have attacked the shortage-
of-artisans problem in the first days of the
war, and by this time would have had
enough trained men to keep every arma-
ment and every ammunition factory in Aus-
tralia going 24 hours a day seven days a
week.
♦-
The Broken Gauges of Commerce.
A new Weights and Measures Act provides
that in any contract for sale of peas by the
bushel that measure shall represent 601 b.
But if the stuff sold is pollard the bushel
shall be 201 b., while in maize the measure is
to hold sQlb., and in oats 401 b. A long list
of articles is given, and the trading public is
informed of the exact weight to be legally
crammed into the bushel. Of course, any
number of things are left out. Thus if a
man wishes to sell anybody a bushel of Hun-
garian millet he must weigh out 601 b.; but
if he offer a bushel of cigarette butts or
cow’s whiskers or anything unusual, he must
worry out whether 201 b., as in the case of
bran, or 601 b., as in the case of wheat, shall
constitute the bushel. Could anything indi-
cate more clearly the chaotic nature of our
system of weights and measures? Only a
century ago the basis of our measures of
length was the barleycorn. Three barley-
corns round and full constituted the legal
inch, and feet and yards, not to speak of
miles and leagues, were as variable as the
crops or the seasons. As the square
measure was based on the longitudinal
count, it followed that in a good season an
acre was likely to be considerably larger
than in a time of ruined crops and dearth.
England worried along with the haphazard
system for centuries, until some brilliant
genius thought of establishing a standard
yard. Then Parliament got to work and had
a rod of copper, measuring 108 barleycorns,
built into an office at Westminster. There-
after the barleycorn disappeared except from
the school table-books, and the yard of copper
became the standard from which foot-rules
and measuring tapes were constructed. Pints
and pounds and a few other things were also
established; but no one dared to go the
length of suggesting that gold and soap
should be weighed by the same rule, or that
one table should do for wheat and barley and
oats. In France decimal systems were
adopted and proved an immense saving of
time and labor, but England regarded these
things as savoring of the Reign of Terror,
and slu-ank from a toil-saving device that
appeared to have some remote connection
with the death of Marie Antoinette. Eng-
land still muddles through with the old con-
fusion, which she calls her system, and Aus-
tralia lamely follows with her 5i yards to
the rod, pole or perch ; and her schoolmasters
in seasons of special insanity give her un-
fortunate children sums to do in that out-
rageous measure, the cubic rod. If Australia
could see her way to introduce decimal coin-
age and weights and measures, and to
arrange that all solids should be sold on one
scale of weights, and all liquids on one scale
of measures, the hours that would be saved
to the nation would be great enough to
allow us to do many things that very badly
need doing. Australia loses a lot of time,
which means a lot of cash, through her
broken railway gauges; but the breaks in her
railway gauges are no more serious
than the broken gauges of her monetary and
commercial system. If the latter were stan-
dardised the saving would certainly pay for
the cost of making the railways sane with-
out waiting for the 2507th report on the
subject.
The Man Who Has Done His Dash.
When the war began R. Scrimshaw left
with the First Battalion for Egypt. It was
generally agreed that in enlisting he had
“played the game,” and in all respects acted
up to the best traditions of the bulldog
breed. His companions gave him a wristlet
watch. Total strangers stopped him in the
streets and urged him to nullify the good
effects of his training by drinking with them.
His employers sent for him, wrung his hand
and said they were proud of him, and that
the difference between his military pay and
his office screw would be handed to his rela-
tives. He sailed in a blaze of glory and
cheers and enthusiasm and alcohol. (The
Bulletin, let us say here, does not know R.
Scrimshaw, but it knows lots of other
Scrimshaws, and they are all the same.)
Last month he was invalided home. But
for his illness, which was not his fault, he
would now be numbered among the heroes
of the Gallipoli Peninsula. Morally he is
as admirable a character as he was when the
First Battalion was about to embark and
the world acclaimed him. But he. labors
under the handicap of having done his dash.
His work as a soldier is finished ; and so,
as has happened often in the past, the
community is finished with him. According
to a daily paper:—
Feeling in every way as fit for duty as before,
Scrimshaw, whose funds were exceedingly low, ap-
pealed for employment. He wrote two letters with
the same object, but received no reply to either.
Subsequently he called in person and made another
appeal, and was told that as soon as there was a
job for him he would be informed. In the interval
he was in such dire straits as to be compelled to
pawn his wife’s ring and his own effects.
When last heard of Scrimshaw had made
an unsuccessful appeal for help to the
Patriotic Fund—which was obliged to turn
him down on a fine point of etiquette or
procedure or something—and he was in
feverish pursuit of a square meal, having
had nothing to eat since breakfast the pre-
vious day. The returned soldier is usually
treated the most coldly by the people who
cheered him the most hotly when he left.
But other wars have been different from
this one. The issue has not been a thou-
sandth part so important. Stay-at-home
citizens who think that they can safely
alienate the nation’s Scrimshaws at this
stage of the proceedings are making a big
mistake. The Allies’ side of the argument
—namely, the pushing of the German out
of the territories which he has invaded- —
has not yet so much as begun. More, and
more men who felt as Scrimshaw did nine
months ago are needed to take their lives
in their hands to whatever part of the world
they may be sent, if the assets of the em-
ploying classes who remain behind are to be
secured. Hence, if there is to be any turning
down of returned soldiers, The Bulletin
solemnly urges all hands to reserve it
till the war is over, and there is no further
need for volunteers. Pending the arrival
of that glad time, let us treat the hero and
the potential hero like kings, even though,
through misfortune, they may be unable to
do any more work for us on the battlefield.
It is not a question of ethics, but of hard,
cold business. This paper would not put it
like that but for the fact that, so far as a
number of people are concerned, it is the
only statement of the case that appeals to
them.
The New Chief.
“Personnel’s” estimate of the new Chief:
James Gordon Legge has been appointed to the
command of the Australian army in the field.
Great organiser and untiring worker, he has until
now been considered better adapted for the office
than the field. His appointment is therefore re-
garded as an experiment. It is said in these days
of big armies and big formations that the proper
place for the leader is back from the firing line,
where, free from the noise and distracting influences
of battle, in some secluded spot, surrounded by
staff, telephones and telegraphs, with maps spread
out before him, he may move his army as pieces
on a chess-board. Those who take this view argue
that the day of personal leadership is at an end, and
its proper qualities are a cool head, ready brain
and the ability to seize quickly and profit by the
mistakes of the enemy. If these be the only neces-
sary qualifications, Colonel Legge possesses them.
He has a forceful, dominating manner, and to that,
coupled with ambition and an untiring energy, he
owes his present position.
Legge began life as a school teacher, passed as
a barrister whilst holding his job, and entered into
practice in association with the learned counsel
who is now Justice Ferguson. He didn’t
do much at the Bar beyond literary work. His
military career began in the Ist Infantry Regi-
ment. With him there were Laurence Armstrong,
Hubert Murray (now Lieut.-Governor of Papua),
Colonel Holmes, who later commanded the regiment,
and Colonel Lenehan, now of the Field Artillery.
From the Ist Infantry he secured a position on
General Hutton’s staff. When the South African
affair began, Legge was considered the smartest offi-
cer of infantry in N. S. Wales, and as such was
placed in command of the first infantry unit to be
despatched to the war. But he gave up the
command to Holmes and took the position of ad-
jutant when his company, turned into mounted in-
fantry, joined the Ist Mounted Rifles at Bloemfon-
tein under Colonel Knight. (Knight, by the way,
was killed recently in Flanders.) Legge’s qualities
did not obtain much preference for him in South
Africa, and he returned to Sydney at the conclusion
of the war to take up his staff duties in N. S.
Wales.
It was the Randwick Rifle Range case of Evans v.
the Commonwealth that brought him into promi-
nence with the Federal Government, and more par-
ticularly with the present Minister for Defence.
The Defence Department was keenly anxious to win’
the suit. If the plaintiff succeeded it meant the
closing of the rifle range, or the resuming of proper-
ties with big compensation to be paid to the house-
holders in the vicinity. Legge was just the man
for the job. He worked like a demon in getting
up the case, threw himself into it heart and soul,
and as principal witness succeeded in convincing the
jury that no bullets could strike the plaintiff’s house
or any other house in the vicinity. (A few weeks after-
wards, by the way, a laborer going to his work was
struck by a bullet whilst passing along the road in
front of Evans’s house.) Legge never looked back. He
made himself indispensable to every Defence Minister
who took office — Ewing, Cook, Millen, Pearce, all
left flattering references on record for their suc-
cessors’ guidance. An ardent advocate for com-
pulsory service, he was entrusted with the drawing-
up of the scheme by Senator Pearce. When the
Labor Government was succeeded by the Liberals,
Legge was able to get along just as well with Joe
Cook. He had an opportunity, too, of bringing himself
under the notice of Kitchener ; but that didn’t
help him much. In fact, they didn’t hit it off too
well.
Since the war began his work as Chief-of-the-Gen-
eral-Staff has been enormous, but he has been able
to cope with it successfully. He has the consti-
tution of an ox, and it is said, with an occasional
cup of tea and a biscuit, can work 18 hours a day
without a break, and feel fit at the end of it.
Yet, though abstemious, he is not by any means a
teetotaller.
The bombing of Ramsgate by Zeppelins
last week was a pointless performance un-
less from the standpoint of one who makes
a hobby of murdering civilians. The place
has no forts and no soldiers, and no war-
ship bigger than a destroyer could get into
its harbor. The only possible thing that
could have attracted the Germans to it is
St. Augustine’s Church, on the outskirts ot
the town. This is said to be the most perfect
bit of Gothic architecture that Pugin ever
conceived. It is a small church, however,
and correspondingly hard to hit. If the
apostles of Culture had turned inland they
would presently have arrived over Canter-
bury Cathedral itself—a worthier mark tor
a couple of incendiary bombs. Instead,
they drifted off in the direction of Margate,
where one finds nothing more formidable or
interesting than shrimps and cockneys and
bathing-machines. If a Cook’s excursion
were mismanaged so badly, everybody would
demand his money back.

T. W. Horton, one of the most experienced
and reputable mine-samplers in Australia,
makes a serious complaint:—
An alleged gold-mine at Lakekamu, Papua, was in-
troduced to a party of miners and graziers in Bris-
bane, and on certain statements of values a private
organisation was formed to exploit and equip the pro-
perty. D’Arcy Wentworth was sent to investigate.
He made a number of scattered bores and pits or,
Tiveri River, and estimated the property to contain
some 40,000,000 cubic yards of material worth ss. per
yard in gold—a total of £10,000,000 to be played
with. Mr. Wentworth, who suffered so badly from
fever that his work was interfered with, advised fur-
ther testing before accepting the figures. The graziers
opposed further testing, having confidence in the first
estimates, regarded Mr. Wentworth’s work as con-
firmatory, and declared their intention of finding the
money. Consequently the miners had either to take
up their shares or be left out; so they came in, and
two second-hand dredges were bought in New South
Wales.
A second syndicate holding the land below the
original sent J. S. Armstrong and myself to investi-
gate, guided and assisted by Capt. Richard. The first
line of bores found no values. The bottom row of
pits on the top area-were then checked, and instead
of finding shillings per cubic yard less than id. re-
sulted. One pit at the top of the property was also
checked with similar disappointing results. Whilst
this checking was in progress two experienced inde-
pendent prospectors (who had instructions to exercise
every care) bored, under certain guidance, anothei
area on Cassowary Creek, and results equal to the
original Tiveri area were obtained. On their depar-
ture, Armstrong and I, having land adjoining,
checked some of their work, and found less than id.
per cubic yard. Captain Richard fortunately reached
Moresby in time to stop the despatch of the first
dredge, and both properties were reported to be salted
throughout.
The Lieut.-Governor was approached with a view to
prosecuting the culprit or culprits, but would take no
action. The Papuan officers are very agreeable, but
behind one’s back look for complaints on behalf of
the native laborer against the while employer, yet
will do nothing to protect the fair name of the coun-
try in things that matter. The writer has had experi-
ence of native labor in Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Malay
States and Siam, and, being an Australian, is ashamed
of the Australian effort in Tropical Adminstration in,
Papua, and is of opinion that unless the Administra-
tion protects and assists the pioneers in both mining
and agriculture, the result will be disastrous to pro-
gress in Papua. Every miner who knows compares
the work done in German New Guinea to the dis-
advantage of our own, and agrees that unless Aus-
tralia alters its methods the present subsidy of
£25,000 a year from the Commonwealth will have to
be increased, and the country will be colored a bad
yellow save for a few snug Government billets.
An electioneering lie of many years’ stand-
ing was laid in the Queensland elections
on Saturday. Ever since the Labor-Liberal
issue was brought into Australian politics
the Tories have claimed that they had be-
hind them a tremendous body of electors
who did not vote because their party de-
clined to “dragoon” them into going to the
polls. This yarn served to explain away
Liberal defeats, to discredit Labor wins, and
to make the other'side appear a contemptibly
slavish lot. The Denham Government
seems to have taken all this seriously. _ It
introduced a clause into the State Elections
Act making voting compulsory. A better
way to discover the strength of the “silent
vote” could not have been contrived. The
Government entered on the elections with
a majority of two to one. After a long,
happy day of compulsory voting it has
emerged with a majority of two to one.
against, and with the Premier, the Trea-
surer, and various other Ministers routed.
It is not so much a defeat as a cataclysm.
It is already being said, in extenuation, that
“Liberals who were driven to the polls in
this sheep-like fashion would of course vote
against the people responsible for this out-
rage upon their freedom.” But it is too
thin—much too thin.

The metallurgists’ idea is that iron
—the indispensable iron—had a lot _ to
do with the onslaught on Belgium
and France. The German leaders, fired
with their tremendous dream of Ger-
man world-dominion, foresaw that, at
the recent rate of production, Ger-
many’s deposits would peter out in about 30
years; and they held that no nation could
reign supreme in a civilised age.if obliged to
‘obtain its supplies from outside. In par-
ticular, they realised that a nation that
bought and could not produce its raw material
for steel would be in a parlous position
when an international row started, if it did
not control the ocean. This being too big
an order to be filled immediately, they reached
out for the supplies handy to their own bor-
ders. Following on this metallurgists’ ex-
position of the reason why Germany desired
particularly to absorb parts of Belgium and
France, comes the information that Japan’s
policy in China is based on the same logic.
Japan, like every other virile ■ nation, cher-
ishes ambitions of becoming a much larger
world-power than she is now, and foresees
trouble in the fact that she is forced to obtain
most of her raw iron from China. Like
Germany, she argues that no nation can
become really great that does not control its
iron supply; and she has taken such action

hat apparently, when the Christians of civi-
lised Europe have battered and bankrupted
each other into quietude, they will find few
iron deposits left in China, that land which
is exceptionally rich in iron, for Christian
capital to exploit. There remains Australia,
with its tremendous and almost untouched
deposits, and all the necessary materials for
smelting and hardening the metal. Sooner

The Long-drawn Agony of War.
The passing months having destroyed the
tancitul framework upon which prophecy
might build its comforting forecasts as to the
duration of the war, the obviously futile
piobleiq of time has given place to specula-
tion upon how many more combatants are
hkely to take part. That the all-in stage
will be reached in Europe before long looks
almost certain, since the causes which have
moved Italy are operating with almost equal
force to drive Roumania, Bulgaria and
Greece to arms. Considerations of national
existence must weigh heavily on the people
of these countries, hitherto cowed by fear of
teutonic might, or paralysed by the influence
of German gold. The immediate effect of
Italian intervention cannot possibly be fore-
seen. The war is a distant, remote conflict,
waged m darkness, from which there emerges
nothing more reliable than casualty lists and
streams of wounded. The only certain thing
magnitude of the task of overcoming
the German bid for hegemony. How the
triple Alliance is going to meet a new enemy
at the gates can only be guessed at; but
that the enemy will be met and fought with
courage and skill and ruthlessness is the
only possible conclusion from the progress of
the struggle up to date. In the east
the Russian is fighting with his back
fairly close to the wall; in the west the
I russian. heel is still on Belgium’s neck; in
th° vl cinity of the harem sanguinary battles
arc still being fought with the malignant
lurk. The strain on the Allies has been
great; the drain on the manhood of Ger-
many and Austria fearful. Yet evidence
so far discloses no weakening on the part
of the enemy, but rather that he can still
hit and hit hard. Meanwhile the rumpus
m England, of which the true inwardness is
for the moment carefully concealed from
Australia, can be taken as a guarantee of
public determination to see the war waged
ashore and afloat with all the strength of
which the nation is capable. From the
neighborhood of the Dardanelles come
more lists of wounded, eloquent of fierce
and prolonged fighting. General Bridges
has gone to a soldier’s grave, and with him
many of the brave lads who sailed away to
strike a blow for race and home. Our boys
are hanging on with the rest —and it 'is
just this hanging-on that is goinsr to win in
the end. But it is going to be a long hang,
with another man sent in for every one
shaken off in many months of trial, and a
fresh shell fashioned for every shell fired.
Judging by his statement that “Australia is
badly supplied with deep-water ports, Syd-
ney and Hobart being notable exceptions,”
•T. F. Ramsbotham, the new director of
Commonwealth lighthouses, has a lot to
learn. Australia is, in fact, remarkably well
supplied with such ports—only they have
been left mostly as Nature made them. In
that very State of Victoria where Rams-
botham spoke to men who knew better than
he, there are at least two ports equal, if not
superior, to Sydney and Hobart. At Port-
land vessels drawing 40ft. will be able to tie
up to the pier now being built in a land-
locked basin ; while at Westcrnport there is
an immense harbor, large enough for all the
shipping around Australia, with a minimum
depth of 66ft. All that the place wants is
improved railway and cargo-handling facili-
ties, along with a general recognition of the
fact that the congestion policy of Melbourne,-
Sydney and other large cities is wasteful and
unpatriotic.
Miss K. S. Pritchard, who lately won
Hodder and Stoughton’s £250 prize for the
best Australian novel—'“The. Pioneers”—was
inspired to write it by McCubbin’s picture
with that title in Melbourne Art Gallery.
A native of Fiji, where her father edited the
Fiji Times, Miss Pritchard has spent most
of her life in Victoria, chiefly in South
Gippsland. She won a short-story compe-
tition in Melbourne while still in her teens,
and later on, after working for the Herald,
went to London and scooped an interview
with novelist George Meredith, her literary
idol —“the proudest incident in my life.”

The usual slick American melodrama
was presented at the Criterion last
Saturday. This time it is called “Under
Cover,” and its author is Roi Cooper
Megrue. It contains the usual clumsy and
complicated first act, the usual bullying offi-
cial who keeps his hat on in his office and
treats ladies with the usual disrespect, the
usual bedroom scene and the usual O. Henry-
ish surprise in the last act. It is this sur-
prise that vitiates the whole play. Here
we have an alleged master-criminal who is
smuggling a priceless pearl necklace through
the U.S. Customs. The super-smuggler goes
to infinite pains and risks his life in order
not to be caught; and then it turns out
that his sole object was to be caught.
When he says that discovery will mean the
penitentiary for him, and that he grows sick
at the thought of it he is lying. At the final
curtain the audience discovers that the
author, for the sake of certain melo-
dramatic situations, has stolen sympathy for
a hero who did not need it. “Under Cover”
is a machine-made play designed solely for
slick situations like that of the bedroom
scene, which, by the bye, is, in plot, remini-
scent of the scene in “The Gay Lord Quex.”
* * * *
The play is adequately cast. Judging
from the frequency with which Lincoln
Plumer is asked to be a bullying cad, there
must be a lot of these individuals loose in
the U.S. —or, maybe, so many U.S. drama-
tists have seen Plumer in the part that they
can’t help writing him another. Eardley
Turner, if only he would refrain from twist-
ing his miniature moustache, would receive
from this paper nothing but praise for a
quiet part subtly played. Hobart J. Cavan-
augh fails to realise the humor and charac-
ter of his original. If. Charles Millward
would cease to believe he expressed deep
emotion by blinking his eyes, he would carry
more conviction in his emotional moments;
but. in the part of the necklace smuggler
he is otherwise admirable. Suave, grace-
ful, confident he can always be; and
m the delicate touches of his first love-scene
with Ethel Cartwright he strikes just the
right, but difficult, note. The introduction
by the author of the part of a girl who pre-
tends that she is deaf and dumb, though
quite, unnecessary for the purposes of the
plot, is forgiven in this performance, so clever
is the acting of Gertrude Boswell. Sylvia
Bremer lacks the subtlety necessary for the
part of Amy Cartwright: she surely pro-
claims her guilt with a crude and an exag-
gerated emphasis. Florence Heston is obvi-
ously a much more colorless American girl
than the author conceived; but Dorothy
Davies fills the part of a good-hearted and
capable matron with a full appreciation of

its every point. Of Muriel Starr all that
is necessary to say is that she brings all
her histrionic resources to a part that per-
fectly suits her, and yet contrives, even in
her most emotional moments, to preserve the
innocence of the character of this young,
inexperienced girl.
Being in the pious habit of saying grace
before its Gilbert and Sullivan, this paper
doesn’t feel inclined to hurl the unpadded
brick of criticism at the quick-change sea-
son which started at Her Majesty’s (Syd-
ney) on Saturday night with a very decent
performance of “The Gondoliers.” In the
reorganised co. Katie May and Gladys
Moncrieff—both youthful lightweights—
took the places of the mature ladies who,
during the last season, gave an air of staid
solidity to the cast. Edward McKeown
tenored nicely as one gondolier, and Frank
Wilson, as the other, baritoned without un-
due excitement. G. Villiers Arnold (Luiz),
Chas. Walenn (Duke of Plaza-Toro) and
Ethel Morrison (Duchess) did creditably
in their former jobs, while Pearl Ladd, with
her meek Philharmonic manner, appealed
for kind consideration as Casilda. “lolan-
the” started a three nights’ sprint on Wed-
nesday, and “The Mikado” is scheduled to
arrive on Saturday. It is a sort of critics’
pursuit race.

When the official casualty list of the

gering document. “A Thief in the Night,”
which is responsible for this week’s blood-
shed, concerns the Italian Red Hand, a
society that makes a hobby of robbery, black-
mail and assassination. And when an
Adeplhi bellowdrama makes a business of
murder instead of treating it merely as a
sideline, things begin to move; wherefore
those who view “A Thief in the Night” from
the front stalls are advised to take um-

To those who like to see soldiers togged up
in absurd red costumes that would mean sui-
cide within five miles of the trenches, but are
beautiful in peace times, or to see thousands
of them marching in such perfect alignment
that even Willie of Potsdam and his goose-
steppers would envy them, the kinema.color
pictures of “The Fighting Forces of Europe,”
now showing at Sydney Lyceum, will appeal.
Those who expect to see the genuine thing,
blood, bayonets and mud, may stay at home.
And those who expect to gaze admiringly on
the Australian troops who made history in
an hour may also stay at home. Possibly if
the Australians wore kilts, or red uniforms,
or busbies they would find a place; but busi-
ness-like khaki doesn’t appeal to the kinema-
color. As a chronicler of parade-ground
marching, beautiful uniforms and fine horses
the films are splendid, especially those of the
Italian cavalry and the British Horse Artil-
lery. Some of the pictures are old, some
new. Those that are on the ancient-history
side are worth a second visit; the new ones
are in places too good to miss.

After to-morrow night Allen Doone will
bo Allen Done at the Palace (Sydney). The
piece is “Molly Bawn,” in which Doone
saws off some of Robert Emmett’s memor-
able speech and proposes “A Toast to Erin”
—his best song. On Saturday E. J. Carroll
will introduce Graham Moffat and co. at
the theatre in “A Scrape o’ the Pen.” It’s
as Scotch, ye ken, as “Bunty Pulls the
Strings,” and no paper could say more than
that without overdoing things.

Melba has thrown herself into another
scheme for the benefit of wounded soldiers,
the_ first contingent, of whom will soon be
arriving in Australia. In response to the
urgent appeal of the Red Cross, Mrs. Keith
Jopp and a Sydney committee have decided
to promote an afternoon of Bridge upon a
very large scale, at which players will, by
engaging a table, be able to entertain
parties of friends. The frivolity has been
fixed for June 4, the last day of Melba’s
stay in Sydney. The price will be not less
tnan _s. od. a chair, and it has been sug-
gested that the winnings should be added
to the funds. These will be devoted to
guaranteeing to the Red Cross that a cer-
tain number of beds will be supported by
this committee at whichever hospital it is
finally decided to maintain our wounded
men.

The trouble with “The Marriage Market”
on Saturday night was a superfluity of talk
which prolonged the show to far beyond the
time when all good musical comedies ought
to be in bed. Not that it is very good, or
even much better than its predecessor,
High Jinks.” But it is as handsomely
staged as many another musical show at
Her Majesty’s (Melb.), if not more so, and
among the thousand and one lines that need
thinning there are some witty gags. The
names of the persons responsible for the
book and the music are not stated on the
programme. Apparently it is an Anglo-
American production of mixed parentage,
and certainly the words of the lyrics would
sound pretty foolish if the singers made
them more audible. There is a story which
at the outset, smacks of “Dorothy,” plus
mining > melodrama, and suggests comedy,
vaudeville and nervous exhaustion in its
later stages. There is music of a formless,
harmless character, and a chorus that fre-
quently appears to have been dragged in by
order of the stage management. On the
whole a reasonably entertaining musical
play,, dotted o’er with specks of dullness and
coming to a specially weak conclusion

Leslie Holland, as the stereotyped lord,
has a. part that might have been written for
the inimitable Huntley, and is mostly
“THE MARRIAGE MARKET.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two girls from San Francisco came, two tony bits
of stuff,
Disguised in a fictitious name, to Mendocino Bluff;
They meant to set the hearts aflame of miners rude
and rough,
To play the “Marriage Market’’ game,
Preserving what is called “fair fame,”
And quietly to gang them hame when they had
joked enough.
Now Kitty Kent was pleased to mash an English
johnnie lord,
A gentlemanly spendthrift rash whom creditors had
bored—-
The sort whose fund of ready cash by marriage is
restored.
Miss Gilroy struck a cowboy flash,
Who cracked a whip with lengthy lash,
And would have loved a crimson sash and silver-
plated sword.
Miss Mariposa Gilroy’s joke had ochre on his cheeks;
He bent his eyebrows when he spoke, like one who
vengeance seeks:
In fact, a picture-drama bloke witli woolly, Grusoe
breeks.
Miss G. was rich and sweet and slim,
Yet, victim to her sportive whim,
She gave her virgin heart to him!
The maidens both went off to dream of their respec-
tive freaks.
They figured later on a yacht; anon they went
ashore;
But never once those girls forgot that giddy day of
yore.
The lord bemoaned his lonely lot, the cowboy’s heart
was sore.
His Lordship came and said, “Eh, what!”
The Cswboy sang his passion hot
(We dropped a penny in the slot and made him
sing some more)....
The same old ending to the plot, and then bouquets
galore.

mmorous in the hands of Holland. Phil
Smith, as a low comedian, heaps extrava-
gance upon absurdity, as a rule, and is often
a severe trial to the sophisticated; but he
has two or three moments when he relaxes
his efforts and is funny. Moreover, his
dancing makes some amends. Derek Hud-
son is a posing, swaggering, ogling, scowl-
ing, tuneful cowboy, or sailor, as occasion
requires; whilst the divinely nimble Maggie
Dickinson gives a- capital impersonation of
a midshipmite. And there are others —

These first-appearancers are satisfactory
rather than startling. They lack force of
personality and distinction in style. Per-
haps it is the play’s fault that they leave
you nothing to remember them by. Miss
Cadman, as the sentimental heroine, reveals
a sweet, well-trained, light soprano voice
and a beseeching smile. Miss Raye warbles
and dances usefully, and may have more
vivacity than appeared on the first night.

aches as the dreary mariner who, despite his
own experiences of feminine frailty, threatens
six months in splints to any base cur who
barks at the honor of the sex. Ronald Riley,
as the naughty Lucas List, hovers with lago-
like intensity about Cross’s credulous ear,
and samples the available bits of muslin with
all the enthusiasm of an emotional epicure.
Riley is apparently a partner in Madame de
Meral’s alleged massage joint, where comely
wenches are prescribed for nervous disorders.
In the strongest scene in the play the brute
orders himself a spoonful of heroine in tears
three times a day; but the medicine escapes
through a handy window and leaves the giddy
patient lamenting. Madame de Meral is a
slender apparition gliding about on the high
heels of Miss Jean Robertson, but clothes
fail her to express the luridness of the part.
Miss , Oriel Hotson might also be mentioned,
for she is the hoarse representative of The
Unsatisfied Thirst whom George Cross mar-
ries in a moment of beery aberration. The
lady’s insobriety is rather striking, and is
one of sundry side-shows, among which Fred
Kehoe’s finery and the red nose of Ward
Lyons also have a prominent place. Next
Saturday the moist season sets in with a
revival of “East Lynne.”

The Orchestral Concert experiment at Melb.
Town Hall last Saturday was a success in each
respect, so the question as to running a
series of concerts through the football season
was answered in the affirmative. In the
first half of the programme Massenet’s
Scenes. Pittoresques were more appealing to
the Philistines than an ambitious tone story
by Saint Saens, whilst between the two orches-
tral pieces came Robert Parker, impressively
vociferous though rather impassiofiate—in
two songs from “Faust.” The second half
was devoted to the Fourth Symphony of
Tschaikowski, which avoids Russian melan-
choly and doesn’t pretend to tell the auditor
a lot more things than any orchestra can put
into clear expression. The third movement,
in which the busy violinists harp upon the
strings without ever using their bows, is a
delightful thing, and the final movement gives
an exciting time all round.

At the Melbourne Auditorium the indivi-
dual and concerted efforts of the Steele-
Payne Entertainers are happening as before
in a somewhat different selection of items.
One way and another the S.-P’s produce a
lot of musical effects, and when several of
them get going; at the same time, the music
they do is only' part of the entertainment.
The rest consists of the way they do it and
the ornafe. instruments they are operating
upon.

The topliner at Melbourne Tivoli this
week is Lawrence Leonard, an English
ginger who employs a large, round tenor in a
Covent Garden manner. His good voice is
heard at its best in operatic items; he is
less entertaining when condemned to wade
through the dripping of :a' popular song.
Gentleman J. Corbett is an unassuming re-
vival, while the elaborate prancing of Keith
and Ivanoff cannot compare in force and
vitality with the French tango as supplied
by the Soho pair. Two other newcomers
are Smith and Nielsen, singers and patter--
ists, who travel long distances to reach a
joke which usually shows that the journey
was not worth taking. sC *

“In Vacation Time,” another “tabloid
musical comedy,” is supplying the Bletsoes
with an excuse for extending their stay at
Melbourne Bijou. Saltley and His Nibs are
enjoyable enough in their wire acrobatic
business, and George Ford has improved the
education of his young friend ’Erb since this
journal last beheld him. Also Albert and
Bowman, comedy sketch artists, are drifting
about “In the!. Clouds” in a way to give them
a headache, while the notable cullud gentle-
men, Brown and Sorlie, continue to disclose
their unusually good qualities as singers and
comedians. Probably Pope and-Sayles in
their joyful youth were never so engaging as
these niggers from Amurka.

AT POVERTY POINT.
Nancye Stewart is being pushed into the
limelight these days. Half-way through the
“Du Barry” season at Dunedin (M.L.) re-
cently Nellie contracted a bad attack of
hoarseness, so daughter Nancye, who had
been playing the small part of Marie Antoin-
ette, was hustled into the star rOle. Nancye
was handed a large collection of heather
and bracken at the close of the performance,
and next day the papers featured the de-
light with which mamma had watched
daughter’s performance.
From London: —
In spite of • her 70 years and the still heavier
handicap of an amputated leg, Sarah Bernhardt has
actually mapped out another American tour, and
would not need much persuading to revisit Australia
as well. Maurice Dounay has written a new play
for her; in it she has to lie on a couch all the time
and talk beautifully to the other characters. Her
first appearance after the amputation is to be in
Paris, where she will recite at a performance pro-
moted by Pierre Loti, novelist and French naval
officer, to benefit a war charity. In September she
sails for N’York, where, besides the new piece, she
proposes playing “Phfedre” and “Joan of Arc.”
“W.A.R.” argues for the Australian pro-
ducer :—•
I patronise the moving pictures because in the
flickers I find finer and more subtle acting and more
artistic production than I do among the importations
on the Australian stage. At least, I used to. The
productions oi the Nordisk company and those by
Danish, Swedish and Italian companies are infinitely
more like works of art than anything now to be
seen on the stage here. The Nordisk co. reveals itself
as the finest in the world. If the heroine has to' be
a lady she is a lady; if the hero is a gentleman he is
a gentleman. There is no hurry; no deaf and dumb
alphabet; no crowding the performers into a corner
of a room. The ease and leisure about the filming
of their dramas produce the nearest effect obtainable
to actual life. The settings, too, are artistic, re-
fined, spacious, and the film effects original and
dramatic. The same praise can be handed' to- the
other countries mentioned; for these countries—and
probably Australia—possess actors and actresses who
have the acting instinct. The slightest gesture is
sufficient to express even a subtle idea, simply because
the European filim-performer has inherited the art of
genuine pantomime, or wordless play. But these
effects were- probably expensive, because artistic;
and naturally the U.S.A. rushed in where art found it
too expensive to tread. Hence the recent influx of
“made in America” comedy and melodrama. The
American film comedian is apparently recruited from l
the cheap vaudeville stage; he doesn’t act—he makes
comic faces and does vaudeville “stunts” and grotes-
queries still surviving in our musi« halls when the
comic Irishman meets the comitr drunk. The- Ameri-
can melodramactor seldom looks his part. The hero
has the same thick, uninteresting face and the same
thick, ungainly body as the villain, and the heroine
is usually a scraggy, cheeky flapper, vivacious but
horribly ungainly and utterly lacking in grace or
refinement. Their method of acting is not acting at
-all. It consists in translating into the deaf and
dumb language an intention that, by a European
artist, is merely expressed by a fleeting change of
expression. Thus the American film-actor who wants
to tell you that he intends to propose to the usually
horrible heroine, does not let you see his intention in
his expression, but he advances to the mouth of the
camera, points to himself, then to the lady, hurriedly
goes through the pantomime of proposing or clasping
the horrible heroine, deliberately points to the third
finger of his left hand, and hastily indicates that
that is exactly where he intends to place the ring.
That is not acting. And the producer nearly always
manages to convey to the audience that he has only a
crammed quarter of a room for his characters; you
know, instinctively, that the action is taking place in
a flimsy studio; whereas the European dramas give
glorious vistas of solid interiors. The Land of the
Wooden Ham is naturally becoming the Land of the
Wooden Hamlet. Since the more artistic productions
are ceasing to come to Australia, and the picture-play
threatens to become swamped under the deadening
mediocrity of the U.S.A. machine-made films, it is
up to the Australian producer.
Nordica’s first husband went up in a
balloon and never came down. Or, if he did
come down, he didn’t go home.
“E.T.”: Though it is of no great import-
ance, I should like to assure “0.P.” that the
statement attributed to a member of the Gil-
bert and Sullivan co., that Gilbert preferred
his Koko to be a small man, has its foundations
in solid fact. Certainly the representatives
of the part in England were all small men,
from the original (Grossmith) down to pre-
sent-day H. A. Lytton. They contrasted with
the Pooh Bahs who were all beefy indivi-
duals of the Rutland Barrington and Fred
Billington type. I admit Grossmith was
never “round”; he was “small” and spare.
George Thorne, Walter Passmore and our
present visitor, C. H. Workman —principal
comedians at different times under the
D’Oyley Carte banner —were all good Kokos
(I have seen the lot), and all were small
physically. Workman has developed a very
well-fed appearance these days,, but when he
played in Gilbert and Sullivan opera he was
as slim as Grossmith and (whisper) quite as
clever. His performance of the Lord Chan-
cellor (“lolanthe”) remains, in memory as a
masterly one.
“S.S.”: Graham Moffat, the Scot who
wrote “Bunty Pulls the Strings,” has hit
them in London with another little vaudeville
play, which he will probably enlarge for the
theatres, as he did “Bunty.” The new
“Scawtch” comedv is “The Concealed Bed.”
and its humor is derived principally from the
ingenious thriftiness of a pawky Presby-
terian family. What a mint o’ siller there is
in Scawtch tliriftiness!
It was at a vaudeville entertainment in
Melbourne on a recent Sunday night. The
volatile comedian suddenly ceased his frivol-
ities with his scantily-clad partner, and
pointed to a man in a front seat in the stalls.
“Hush!” he said. “There is a man asleep.”
The patron opened his eyes. He flushed and
half-arose. “Asleep!” he answered in a
loud growl. “Asleep? It’s rotten enough to
make me wish I was dead.” Then he sat
down. It is not always wise for the
comedian to get too gay with his victims.

Will Dyson’s London exhibition of ear-
toons was so successful from the point of
view of the showman (admission, one shil-
ling) that it was kept going for five or six
weeks; and now it is on tour, and was draw-
ing big houses in Sheffield when the last mail
left.
It is cabled that Winston Churchill mby
go to the Front. Few men of his age have
seen more active service. He began in Cuba
in 1895; fought through the Malekand cam-
paign ; went with the Tirah Expeditionary
Force in ’9B, and, while with the Nile Expe-
ditionary Force, took part in the Battle of
Khartoum. He was trying to get into Parlia-
ment when the Boer war started. Throwing
up politics, he left for Africa, joined a local
regiment, and saw most of the fighting that
took place there except for the month he
was a prisoner. He has served with both in-
fantry and cavalry regiments, and with
Spanish, British, Indian and S’Africah
troops. He began in the 4th Hussars, in
which regiment he Was detested. The in-
sults, covert and otherwise, of all hands,
from the Colonel downwards, left him com-
placent. He ascribed it all to jealousy. He
gets more consideration in his present regi-
ment —the Oxfordshire Yeomanry—many of
the officers being his relations, friends and
warm admirers. For example: his cousin,-
the Duke' of Marlborough; his brother,-
Major John Churchill 1 ; and F. E. Smith,
K.C. ~
A diverting feature of the John Murray
inquiry in Victoria was the examination of
Newman, the admiral of the much-discussed
craft. A bluff and ready sea-dog is skipper
Newman. “What would you say if Brown,
Jones and Robinson all swore he was there
four days?” asked barrister Maldon Robb,
after the cap’n had said somebody had been
on board for three days. “Well, it is like
this, Mr. Robb,” was the reply; “if you, and
the Judge here, and all the other barristers
said he was there four days, I would still
say he was there three days.” “What did
you say when he spoke to you in that insult-
ing manner?” asked Robb. “Nothing,”
answered the salt. Robb bristled. “Come,
now, you don’t mean to say that you allowed
him to speak like that and made no reply?”
Newman was sure he had said nothing.
“Then you wish me to understand that
nothing happened?” persisted counsel.- “Oh,
no,” was the response, “something happened.
I shook him like a rat and threw him out of
the cabin.” Then, by way of an after-
thought—“ And if you were on board my
'ship and spoke to me like that, Mr. Robb,
I would shake you like a rat and throw you
out of the cabin!”

Never the hero of the show!
No limelight glowl
My roles the audience irate
All execrate.
They only cheer when I, a crook,
Am brought to book;
And all because without the art
Of make-up I can look the part.
No good man there could ever be
Who looked like me;
I never have a virtuous air—
Not anywhere.
The “tuppence-colored” heavy gent.
I represent
Always. It cuts me to the heart.
Managers say: “He looks the part!”
The pro. who walks stage-virtuous ways
Gets the bouquets ;
I get (but mum’s the word, I beg)
Oft-times an egg.
Though I am upright as the day,
Yet in the play
No sympathy, no tears I start.
I must be bad—l look the part!

In connection with the looting in German
New Guinea, one bright young Jew had
tough luck. He got a case of birds of Para-
dise —where or how doesn’t matter —and
they were worth much gold. Next he man-
aged to get himself invalided back to Aus-
tralia, part of his gear, of course, being the
box of birds. To smuggle them past the
Customs was the main trouble, and to that
end he put it to one of the ship’s crew that
there was a tenner going begging. It
changed hands on the spot, the sailor under-
taking to so arrange things that the goods
might be lifted from the wharf by Isaac-
stein. But when Isaacstein went for the
box there was trouble, and after much
anguish Isaacstein separated himself from
another tenner. Then away he went to
realise on the deal. “Yes,” said the traders,
“we’ll buy. Let’s have a look.” Isaacstein
prised the box open carefully, and—there
wasn’t so much as a feather in it.

“Scallywag” : An intention to enlarge the
scope of Parents’ Associations has been ex-
pressed by Arthur Griffith, who took over
the N.S.W. portfolio of Education a few
minutes ago. Griffith, as usual, is in a
hurry to do something. These associations,
formed by the Under-Secretary to cajole
funds out of parents to meet expenses the
Department wants to side-step, are, as a
rule, merely amusing, though in some cases
they are obnoxious. There are places where
some budding alderman donates a fiver to
bring his name before the public; in other
parts the association becomes a society for
sewing conspicuous patches on teachers’ re-
putations. Teachers make use (or other-
wise) of the associations in three ways:
(1) by bleeding them for funds to buy
trumpery articles with which to fool a
credulous inspector; (2) by persuading them
that they are of immense assistance, and
ultimately getting a purse of sove-
reigns from them when leaving the
district; (3) by ignoring their exist-
ence, in which case they do least
harm. No other public servants are forced
to endure the prying of an inquisitive band
of inexpert citizens. That Parents’ Associa-
tions act as charity organisations for a
penurious Department hardly constitutes a
reason for digging them in, and strengthen-
ing their position to harass the teachers.
A recent burglary in the district recalls
that Potts Point, long ago taken by the
onrushing masses of Sydney boarders, is still
regarded by ill-informed people as the inner
citadel of rank and fashion, when in reality
it is only the inner citadel of Hash. The
burglar who, like most “outsiders,” is 30
years behind the social clock, always seems
to make a raid on the poor old dusty Point
when he is after big game. And, of course,
instead of collecting the jewels of the belle
who reigned there in the early ’Bo’s he falls
over the trash belonging to a cheap, modern
female boarder whose gauds are miserable.
The Golden Legend of Potts Point will never
really be shattered until some master crook
starts a central information bureau for
cracksmen.

A divorce suit that had been dawdling
thi'ough the courts for nearly five years—
each party accused the other of desertion
and each wanted a nisi —has just been tor-
pedoed by Justice Gordon, the official
destroyer in N. S. Wales. ’Sonor found
(1) that She did not desert Him, (2) that
He did not desert Her, (3) that they de-
serted each other, and (4) both, as far as
the Law was concerned, could go to Tip-
perary. Then the wise young Judge
submerged himself in the affidavits of
the next application for a way out,
leaving Him and Her to go on desert-
ing one another some more. It is
good law, no doubt, but contemplated
from the strictly moral point of view, what
a farce it is !

South Aus. is in the position of the Scotch
minister who had just been praying for rain
when a storm blew the kirk windows in;
thereupon : “Lorrd, this is juist rideeculous !”
It was S.A.’s front door that was nearly
blown in. The break-up of the local drought
—which has been a record for severity though
not for length—came with a storm that
banked the sea-water up the Gulf, flooded
places round the Port river, smashed the
Glenelg baths, battered jetties, and carried
away bathing-boxes and beach-shelters
beyond counting. The mail steamer Osterley
arrived just in the thick of it, and hung about
the Semaphore roadstead from Saturday
morning till Sunday afternoon before berth-
ing at the Outer Harbor. Indignant passen-
gers are likely to carry about the world some
injurious remarks on a harbor that can be
used at any time except during a storm.
But the facts are that the berthing place is
just inside the Port river, and that with a
real gale from one particular and unusual
quarter there is just a chance of drifting on
to a protecting bank, in entering. Nobody
has done so yet, but occasionally an ultra-
careful captain declines to face the alleged
risk.
NO FRIEND OF HIS.
“Now, who was it that didn’t like the Prodigal Son?”
“The Fatted Calf.”
“Callan Park” :
War was inevitable between Germany and Italy. I
forecasted it. from the first. (See “My Forecasts,
Rotten and Otherwise.” Chapt. 4, Book ii.) If Italy
had not declared war Germany would. It is a matter
of churches. As an old friend of mine; of the Orange
persuasion, put it after a six-days’ Cook's tour
through Naples, Rome, Bologna and Milan, “The
place is simply rotten with cathedrals.” The Ger-
mans have pretty well finished with the best cathe-
drals of Belgium and Northern France. Bernhardi,
von Kluck, the Crown Prince and other authorities
were all agreed, three months ago, that by July the
Kaiser’s church-breakers would be free to make at
least a beginning in Italy. So the Italian Govern-
ment has not forestalled its cultivated neighbors by
many weeks. According to the cables, operations are
to be begun by the destruction of Venice and Flor-
ence. I should say Venice would go first. The point
is, it is irreplaceable. You can rebuild a modern
city like Louvain or Rheims, but Venice, which is
more or less of a beautiful anachronism, No. The
same incendiary bomb would probably do both for
St. Mark’s and the Doge’s Palace. A little further
down the canal in the direction of the Lido is
Danielli’s, from whose windows I have smelt smells
and encountered mosquitoes of a virulence unsurpassed
elsewhere in the world. And then there are hundreds
of lovely old Gothic palaces, such as the Ca’d’oro,
and some wonderful Franciscan and Dominican
churches. They will make the mouths of the Culture-
bearers water.
But Florence, after all, is the real prize. The
Kaiser himself will probably attend to this important
matter. Giotto’s Campanile, the Duomo by di Cambio,
the Badia, the Church of Santo Spirito—what a grand
day’s work the bombing of these exquisite monuments
will represent for the German arms! What rejoicing,
arid lager-drinking, and giving-of-holidays-of-gladness
to the children there will be in the dear old Father-
land when the news of their fall comes through! The
destruction of Louvain and the sinking of the Lusi-
tania will be nothing to it. Not only does Florence
offer the attraction of a number of beautiful cathe-
drals, but it also has some splendid libraries ; and in
the Uffizi and Pitti galleries (neither of which is
bomb-proof) are works of art on which it is impos-
sible to put a price.
Apropos, I was talking to my friend von Keeholl,
the celebrated spy, the other day, and he said confi-
dently: “America ve vill not effer make invasion mit.”
I asked why. He said the churches were not worth
destroying. A committee of inspection which toured
the U.S. in the spring of 1914 brought back an un-
favorable report. A fraction over 94 per cent, of the
Baptist and Methodv tabernacles turned out to be
made of tin. The 15th Episcopal Church of Hiram
Ezra, on 9700th Street, New York —the place where
as many as 150 Trust magnates may be seen worship-
ping any Sunday morning—is made of blue metal and
designed on the lines of a London railway station.
The Kaiser was shown photographs of a few typical
Yankee churches, and he said, after consulting with
his art-experts: “Such buildings are not worth the
risking of a single Zeppelin.” This is the true ex-
planation, according to von Keeholl, of Germany’s
climb-down in connection with the Lusitania protest.
The foolish white-feather insult has now
made its way to Adelaide. Major Smeaton,
Labor M.H.A., and one of the military cen-
sors, publicly asks for “the favor of five min-
utes with the low coward” who has sent him
one, and who is to “have my answer written
on his hide.” Smeaton was, as a fact, one of
the first to volunteer in S. Aus., but was found
too old; “but I believe I am still a good
enough man to write my reply physically on
the cur who has made me the recipient of
his loathsome attentions.” But what are the
odds that Smeaton has not to reckon with
one of the sex whose hide is by courtesy safe?
Without arguing that one sex is necessarily
more cattish than the other, it is likely that
any male person who took enough interest
in the victim to insult him would have some
knowledge of his age and record.
ASKING FOR TROUBLE.
“O Percy, darling, whatever has happened
to you?”
“Oh, nothin’. mother! We’ve just been play-
ing war, and I was the Kaiser.”

A LITTLE RIME OF THE FUTILITY OF FASHIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like shadows on the flowing years
The fashions come and go,
And whim to silly whim succeeds,
But this let carpers know :
My lady’s like the beam that lights
The touzled scud on sombre nights,
And wild as may be fashion’s flights
She shires above them all.
Her figure laughs at pleat and band ;
Her dimpled shoulders rise
Supreme above the transient stuffs ;
The sparkle of her eyes
Wraps her in radiance like a star,
And were she clad as beggars are
She still would walk a queen.
From every land, from every age
Her glory flashes down ;
She paces slow with velvet train,
She romps in cotton gown,
She walks the court in rich brocade,
And in a tattered frock arrayed
With bare feet light on grasses laid
She dances through the woods.
No wear of leather, satin, wood,
But suits her dainty feet;
No fence of crinoline or ruff
But leaves her still as sweet;
No style of ringlet, puff or braid
But suits her tresses’ silky shade
And makes them fair to see.
Poor Homely Face tries this and that
And doffs and dons again,
Tries flounce and ruffle, band and frill—
Alas for all her pain !
With borrowed tints of white and rose
She daubs her lips, her cheeks, her nose,
And forth in great array she goes—
And sadder she returns.
What web of silk or wool can make
A withered shoulder white?
What gauds can plump a hollow cheek,
Or set dull eyes alight?
What furbelow can add the grace
That beauty gives to form and face?
Poor woman! None at all!
So let the rout of fashion fly
As clouds before the wind,
For glittering like the risen moon
Young Beauty still, we find,
Will triumph through the murky press
Of every flouncy freak of dress,
And in her robe of loveliness
Will far outshine them all.

“8.T.” : How’s this for the pertinacity of
Young Australia? At one point on the
Ballarat-to-Geelong line there lives a family
named Came. The house of Carne faces
the line. The youngest Carne, Jimmy, is
aged five. A few days back Jimmy went
missing. He was lost all day and all night,
and was discovered at ID next morning,
trudging in the direction of Geelong. He had
covered over 14 miles. On being restored to
his parents, and urged to explain, it appeared
that early on the previous (doming he had
thrown his ball over the railroad, and, as
his mother had repeatedly forbidden him to
cross the line, he had started to walk
round.

Little Marengo, the N.S.W. township of
one pub and two stores which covered itself
with glory on Belgian Day by collecting
£DOO, always has been celebrated for bush-
ranging. In the days of Dambing Flat,
diggings it was a very liyely spot. It was
there that, in August, 1802, Daniel Crotty,
the mailman, met his death. lie left with
the mails for Burrowa, leading one horse and
riding another. His dead body was found
on Marengo-road, a bullet-wound in the
head. Three men were concerned in the
murder, the object being the horses, not the
mails. Two were captured and sentenced
to death, and six years later the third, a
Frenchman, was put in the dock. He was
found guilty, too. Another fine morning at
Marengo a Chinaman was hanging to
a tree head downwards. He had been robbed
of 40oz. of gold. His murderers were not
captured. And, finally, in its unregenerate
days, Marengo was a base of operations
for the bush telegraphs which kept Frank
Gardiner supplied with news of police move-
ments in the roaring time of Lambing Flat.
JOHN BULL PROCEEDS TO BEAT HIS JOSS.
The curse surrounding the prickly pear
seems to have crawled into the war. About
the middle of August last, at Dulacca i vj.),
O. C. Roberts had at work 13 plants for
liberating arsenious chloride gas, whose
deadly fumes float through the pear and
crumple it up. To obtain by manufacture
pure arsenious chloride (most of that pro-
cured was adulterated with hydrochloric
acid) the services of German chemists were
secured. But before the war was actually
announced these chemists got away on a
German steadier that left Melbourne
hurriedly. As the floating fumes employed at
the Front by the Germans are said to con-
tain chloride, it is possible that the escaped
Huns may have carried Roberts’s pear-doom
idea with them and tried it on the Allies.
An officer attached to the Maoriland De-
fence forces was ordered the other day to
join his regiment somewhere in France.
He was given a return ticket. Faith, hope
or charity?
* * * *•
If the British and French war bosses
retaliate upon the Germans with poisonous
gases it will be necessary to review Napo-
leon’s _ epigram that Providence fights on
the side with the biggest battalions. It
will be more correct to say that the
Almighty plays on the side with the wind.
“Y.Z.”: We were seeing a theatrical
friend off on a liner at Port Melbourne the
other day. My friend was Corker. Corker
is an artist in a small mercantile way. The
liner was crowded with fussing people ; and
suddenly She dawned upon us. She was
sublime, of middle height, rosy, round, illu-
minating, warming, electric; her smile was
like a spring dawn. The three of us were
impressed simultaneously. Our eyes fol-
lowed the radiant lady. “Glorious,” said I.
“Cleopatra with modern improvements!”
said Busk. “Bet you a quid I kiss her
within an hour,” said Corker. “You know
her?” said the actor. “I do not.” “How
do you purpose making her acquaintance?”
“I don’t. But the bet holds.” I took it up.
We waited. The beauty was fluttering near
a crowd of acquaintances; but Corker made
no advances. I gibed at him gently. I told
him how I proposed spending the pound. The
boll rang for visitors to step ashore, and as
usual there ensued a sort of panic of part-
ing. You know the sort of vortex of fare-
ivells; it is always the same at the last
moment on an outbound liner. A score of
friends and acquaintances were kissing the
beauty good-bye. Corker joined them. He
kissed the beauty in the general bustle of
hugging and osculation. He kissed her
twice, lie might have kissed her again; any
of ns might have kissed her. She simply
didn’t know whom she was kissing in the
confusion. Corker kissed three other girls
—perfect strangers- —before we fled down
the gangway. Corker took my pound. “I
always kiss a few of the prettiest girls when
I visit a departing liner,” he said; “but this
is the first time I’ve been paid for it.”

The Germans are reported to be
“slaughtering vast numbers of hogs and
putting, the carcases in cold stores.” Race
suicide ?
The Law, finding itself in a corner in
Westralia the other day, sensibly ridiculed
the superstition that suicide is always an
act of insanity. R. J. Meakins had been
arrested some months ago on a serious
charge, and being legally advised that the
defence he relied on was useless, shot him-
self while out on bail. He made his will
first, though, leaving his wealth—nearly
£BOO0 —to his five younger children. The
remaining four opposed probate on the ground
of the testator’s insanity; but Justice Burn-
side and a jury, after a very thorough over-
haul, found in favor of the will —which is to
say, in favor of the man’s sanity.
THE SMASH-UP.
GERALD: “I will NOT release you from our
engagement.”
EVANGALINE : “Then I refuse to marry you!
The man who will not consider his
fiancee’s feelings is not likely to consider
his wife's.”
“ Jeames”: The Allies must do more than
confiscate Germany’s fleet if they seek a
lasting peace. They must also put an em-
bargo on marriages between the sovereigns,
heirs and prospective heirs of the smaller
European States and German princes and
princesses. Roumania would have been in
the thick of the war, on the side where its
interests lie, were its king not a Ilohen-
zollern and its queen a Wied. Bulgaria
has nothing to gain and all to lose, from an
Austro-German victory, but its king is a
son of Augustus of Saxe-Ooburg and Gotha,
and his sympathies are as much pro-Ger-
man as they are hostile to the Republic
which drove his mother’s family into exile.
Holland, with a German Prince Consort, is
as Prussian as it dares to be. Of the
Grecian Royal Family ‘London Truth
(17/3/T5) remarked: —
The Queen has inherited qualities, shared, of course,
by the Kaiser, damaging to the body and reacting
unfavorably on the brain and temperament. King
Constantine is a half-German Dane.
Naturally they are both pro-German, and
it was their influence that brought about
the fall of Venizelos, the Prime Minister,
three months ago, and kept Greece neutral.
It is really wonderful how people of Ger-
man or Austrian origin stand together. Take
the case of Princess Christian and her fam-
ily. They abided for a lifetime in a state
of Royal indigence (relieved by the charity
of the British) in the Ascot district. There
they lived the semi-suburban lives of that
genteel neighborhood and seemed to have no
thought of Germany. Their son, Prince
Albert, was educated in England, and
brought up to be the typical sporting Eng-
lishman. As the outcome of it all he
is fighting in a Prussian Hussar Regiment
against the nation which contains all liis
boyhood’s friends. And his case is typical
of thousands.
“Medico”: Back in 1912 the Vic. Board
of Health, being in wanton mood one day,
warned the municipal councils in the
metropolitan area and the bigger provincial
towns that within three years they would
be compelled to close their unsavory garbage
tips and erect modern destructors. But
garbage tips die hard, and the destructors
were still under consideration when War
burst out. With characteristic fatuity the
Board of Health has now decided that, “on
account of the war,” the municipalities
need not clean themselves for another 12
months. So the abominations still remain ;
and, in view of the proposed abolition of
the Board, under amended Health legisla-
tion, it seems not unlikely that the evil of
its lack of deeds will live after it, and
another slice of the good it didn’t do will be
interred with its bones.
“Ace”: Has the
stinking-fish brigade
gone bung as well as
the peace society?
Not long ago it was
common to hear re-
marks that the undis-
ciplined Australians
might be all right in
a dust-up like the
scrimmage with Bro-
ther Boer, in which
they could leap from
rock to rock and
bound behind trees,
but against seasoned,
disciplined troops
would never be worth
a hang. Well, they
have been tried
against seasoned, dis-
ciplined troops, in a
pretty hot corner, too,
and they appear to
have been singled out
specially for a job in
which the leaping was
up a precipice under
rifle fire, and the
bounding was be-
hind a bayonet.
The stinking-fish
brigade never said
a word. As a
matter of fact, the
best troops every-
where are composed
of men who have been
fed well in childhood,
who are of hardy
physique, who possess
individual courage,
keenness and dash,
and everybody but the
peddlers of ripe shark
knew that Australians, having these good
qualities as a foundation, could be drilled
into a military efficiency equal to that of
any other soldiery and better than that of
most.

F. J. Roach, a South Australian settler in
Africa, has sent home an exciting account
of a rising among the Nyassa savages.
It was at the end of January that
they rose, reckoning the time was ripe
because the white men were engaged
killing each other. The leader was the
usual super-intelligent nigger, who had
been taken up by the kind missionaries and
sent to the U.S.A. to be thoroughly trained
as a Baptist minister. When he got back
he started on his great scheme for wiping the
white men out. Every man they could catch
was speared; but the women and children
were merely carried off, with some vague
idea of presently deporting them from the
country. When the frantic survivors had
savagely quelled the rising a day or two
later, all the women and children came strag-
gling back from the native villages, bare-
footed and in their night attire as they had
been caught, but unharmed. Then every-
body realised how lucky they had been to
have fallen into the hands of African savages
and not into the power of Cultured Germans.

When they asked the richest Billjim in
one of the Australian regiments why he had
signed on as the cook’s off-sider, he put it
this way: “Well, a bloke must do his bit,
and when the scrappin’ is on I’ll be some-
where handy ; and when there’s no scrappin’
I’m boilin’ the water. A bloke can get a
blanky bath any time he likes then, see?”

“Ancient Mariner’s” yarn
The death of Alexander Hacking, sometime Super-
intendent of Navigation in N.S.W., has revived the
story of an ancient maritime disaster. On a winter’s
evening in 1861 young Hacking, apprentice on the
British ship Constance, inward-bound from an English
port to Melbourne, when some 150 miles off the
Otway was idly watching the cook throw galley
truck over the rail. Suddenly the man let out yells
of amazement and terror. The Constance was under
full canvas, and Hacking, raising his eyes, saw,
almost at arm’s length as it were, a large barque
bowling along with all sail set also. Before anyone
on either ship could spin the wheel the Constance
struck the other with her bowsprit. ’The barque,
which was the Tubal Cain, from Port Phillip, sank
like a stone with all hands save one, a seaman
perched up on the mainyard. The shock shook him
off and he fell on the Constance’s deck. The rest
of the ship’s company were lost. In these days, what
with Titanics and Empresses of Ireland, to say
nothing of Lusitanias, the total disappearance of a
barque and her crew may seem a bagatelle. But in
ihe ’6o’s the belated appearance of the Constance in
Hobson’s Bay with all her forward running gear and
top hamper a jumbled mass and her tragic tale to
+ ell was the event of the year.
SUBTLE FLATTERY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She gave me a gleaming White Feather—
Her face as impassive as leather.
Said I, “What’s it for?”
She said, “Go to the war.”
Delight and complacence together
Filled my spectacled eyes;
I gasped in surprise—
I wanted to gibber or blether.
So I’m certain would you
If you’d turned fifty-two
(Aqd looked it, in all sorts of weather)
And were greeted as one
Whose career had begun,
By a girl with a visage like leather,
A sneer, and a gleaming WTiite Feather.

Jennings, the second Maorilander to be
heaved out of Parliament lately by the
Supreme Court, was among the first lot; of
Laborites sent to the Leg. Council by Bal-
lance. “Bill” was a compositor by trade
and came from Auckland, where he worked
in the Star office and was president of the
Trades and Labor Council. He hung out
among the old men for 10 years, and then
stood for election to the House of Reps.,
was returned for Egmont—that was in 1902
—and kept on being returned ever since.
An earnest, quiet chap, he was one of the
most popular members. His old electorate,
by the way, is the muddiest in the universe.
Most of the roads are impassable to traffic
six months of the year; but “Bill” used
to get there —on specially-constructed stilts,
lie said.
A DOMESTIC TRAITOR.

As-ain Death’s little ironies. Two pro-
minent Yankees who went clown with the
Lusitania were newspaper-proprietor, Hearst,
one of the most ; rabid, pro-Gerhogs in the
U.S.A., and Elbert Hubbard, Amurka’s, most
persistent anti-militarist and disarmament
fanatic —the person who wrote, that “the plea
that an army is needed for tire protection of
the country is fraud and pretence,” and “Vic-
tory is only another name for defeat —the
spirit of gentleness and love is eternal.”
William Mogford Hamlet, who has been
an imperturbable witness in every poisoning
case in X. S. Wales for the last generation
or two, has just thrown up his ancient job
of Government Analyst. When not nosing
out deleterious substances he put on knee-
breeches and sweater and thought less of a
500-mile jaunt than the ordinary citizen
would of a mile struggle to church. His
ramblings include Brisbane to Sydney (more
than once), and Sydney to Melbourne. Now,
at over 60, lie has joined a rifle club to get
a little extra exercise.
Young Wendover, only son of the Marquis
who was Lord Carrington a quarter of a
century ago, has died of wounds received in
action, llis arm had to be amputated and
he failed to recover from the shock. This
makes Rupert Carrington, who lives most
of his time in Sydney, heir to the family
estates. They are mostly in Buckingham-
shire, around High Wycombe, which is a
little town on a loop-line running from
Maidenhead, and famed chiefly for its chain-
making industry and its tobacconist. The
tobacconist is a sort of village Hamnden or
Chidley. He fights untiringly against the
Sunday-closing laws of his native land.
Every time he sells a pound of shag on the
Sabbath the police proceed against him, and
he fights the case to the last gasp. He has
been doing this for some 20 years, and is
one of England’s institutions. The second
heir and likeliest inheritor of the estates is
the only son of Rupert Carrington and a
daughter, now dead, of squatter Horsfall.
He is about 20, and was wounded in the
eye, in the usual manner, last month. If he
gets killed the odds are heavily in favor of
the title becoming extinct.

“Whitehall” on a young man who lacked
discipline:—-
History repeats itself. Quarter of a century ago
Randolph Churchill, Winston’s father, “forgot
Goschen.” He thought he was an indispensable
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and never dreamed that
.the son of a German moneylender would prove a
greater financier than he. Winston Churchill has the
(same arrogant: self-confidence. It is more justifiable,
however, in his case. Intellectually, he seems to be
one'of:, the biggest men that England has evolved.
His many-sidedness is astounding. His biography of
his father has been pronounced by authorities to be
the greatest thing in its line since “The Life of
Scott” appeared. He was a very capable war cor-
respondent. He is a great debater and a born Par-
liamentarian. And he is only 41. A few months ago
I was shown a letter from Sir John Fisher, which
began “Winston has been splendid.” Now the old
sailor seems to think that he is not so splendid.
He is credited with three coups. The first was the
mobilisation of the fleet. That was an entire success.
The Antwerp adventure was less triumphant. Yet it
was an audacious bluff, and may have held the Ger-
mans back long- enough for the British armies to the
South to save themselves. The Dardanelles attack,
which is ascribed to him, was a plain tragedy, and,
iii the light of what we know now, an act of mad-
ness. Evidently it was the last straw that broke
Asquith’s patience.
Captain Thomas E. Seal, who hoisted the
answering pennant to Father Abraham at
Williamstown (Vic.) last week, was for
over 40 years a member of the Victorian
pilot service. Born in Hobart in 1542 he
went to sea before he needed a razor, and
at 23 held a master’s ticket under his oil-
skins. His greatest achievement perhaps
was in bringing the Oriti through one of
the heaviest blows that ever swept the Tas-
man. In company with four other wind-
jammers the Oriti put out from Newcastle
bound for Hobart, and Seal’s hooker was
the only one to get through. The old pilot
showed Brassey the way to run the Sun-
beam into Port Phillip in a gale of
wind, and it was he who set the course for
the Ophir when George now V. called in to
have a look at Collins-street. lie was 73.
“R. 8.”: Stephen Goeezel, the Wostralian
field geologist, is a Hungarian, born in
the Carpathians, but in Australia for 30
years and more. He talks of Hungarian
likes and dislikes. The Hungarian loves
the French, likes the English, hates the
Prussian and loathes the Russian. Whereas
the Frenchman has 1871 to avenge on the
German, the Hungarian has 184 S to avenge
on the Russian. “The Hungarian,” says
Goeezel, “hates the Prussian splendidly ; but
he hates the Russian —how V —brilliantly.
If the Frenchman shall eat the German,
the Hungarian will say ‘Bon appetito’; but
he will not stop fighting until he is dead
or the last Russian has gone north. The
Hungarian will not bear the slowness of
the trenches—he fights in a storm; and
he says: ‘I fight with a rope round my neck
when I fight the Russian. We go into battle
without fear, as men already dead.’ ”
Since the present King opened the first
Commonwealth Parliament on May D, 1901,
the personnel of both Houses lias so
changed that its own mother wouldn’t know
it. Only one-sixth of the
members of the first Senate
have served continuously,
and not a third of the
original House of Represen-
tatives remains. South
Aus. and Vic. haven’t a
single Senator left of the
first batch elected. Gould
and Millen alone remain of
the Ma State’s first Sena-
tors, and Cook, Chanter,
Chapman, “Billy” Hughes,
Bruce Smith, Spence,
Thomas and Dave Watkins
are the last of the first
brigade in the Reps. More
than a fourth of the mem-
bers of the Parliament who
listened to the opening speech 14 years ago
are dead ; and Forrest is the sole member of
the first Cabinet left in Federal politics.
F. S. Kelly,, the Sydney pianist—brother
of W. H., the politician, and T. H., the

His colonel was the vast Quilter baronet

F. W. Lundie, of the Adelaide City Coun-
cil, from which body .he is excluded till a
£5 fine is paid for an over-candid remark to
Mayor Simpson, made an error-ill tactics last
week. He attended a Council meeting, and
resisted as long as possible the forcible re-
moval which was promptly ordered. The
result was an overturned table and a
struggling Lundie hauled out by two con-
stables. He had behaved with considerable
dignity up till then, in what is after all a
trumpery squabble. If he -wanted an
“assault” to proceed upon legally, he had it
as soon as the first hand touched his
shoulder. To .scuffle in person against the
practically unlimited force of authority can
never do any good. Still, most of the famous
martyrs in history were made of just the
same cantankerous stuff.
“Jimmy” Boyd, M.H.R., is an honorary

ray (Hobson’s Bay station), whereon the
boys are trained for a nautical career and
walloped for discipline’s sake. The rest of
Admiral’s Boyd’s fleet consists of a steam tug
and a barge or two; but there is some talk
of adding a super-Dreadnought to match the
Sea Lord’s suit. By the way, there is an
honorary oflicah of the land forces who com-
pares favorably with Boyd ; for although the
uniform in this case is of less exalted rank,
it is more dazzling to the eye. Honorary
Mfiior R. G. Wilson is the military person-
age. He is the owner of the Broadmeadows
property where the Victorian soldiers are
camped. Though it is not 'all loss that he
suffers, the authorities nevertheless decided
that the , owner ought to have distinctions
heaped upon him. So they made him Major
Wilson. C.C. —the after-letters signifying,
it is understood, Commander of Canteen —-
and flic uniform couldn’t be more gorgeous
if its owner was the absolute monarch of a
whole covey of canteens.

TEACHING THEM.
THE: KAISER: “Anything to report this morn-
ing, Von Turnips?”
VON TURNIPS : “Torpedoed 30 British and
American babies, sir!”
THE KAISER: “Good! That'll teach the
little beggars not to defy Shermany.”
Died on May 15, Elias Greenslade, one
of the pioneers of Yorke Peninsula, the
wheat garden of South A us. The old man
had a hard row to hoe in his early days, but
did it well and leaves a large fortune, though
lie gave away hundreds without mentioning
the matter. Magill Orphanage has a wing
named after him. He owed his success to
sheer hard graft. “Wheat sown before
breakfast grows the best,” was the old
toiler’s week-day text.
Those young Australians who were sent
to get a foothold on the Gallipoli Peninsula
knew what sort of a job was ahead of them.
Captain Douglas r reeman, writing just
before they left Alexandria, said: —
We are to fight for a landing, then for water, then
for a base. It will be a strenuous business. We ex-
pect to have to fight for two days before obtaining
water, and to do it on one day’s water—then four days
more on two days’ rations. I hope, of course, to be
one of the lucky ones, and return to Australia un-
scathed—but I’ll need a lot of luck.
He didn’t have as much luck as ho
needed, and was killed —apparently while
helping to get British reinforcements ashore
lower down the Peninsula. A mining
engineer, the son of an old N.S.W. Land
Board chairman and a nephew of an ex-
Under-Sec. for Lands. Freeman was mine
managing in Queensland when the war
started, and enlisted there. He had his
first taste of soldiering with the Light Horse
in N. S. Wales.
The Office Curate tells the simple story :
By electing as their new Bishop Dr. Lewis Bostock
Radford, warden of the Anglican College at Sydney
University, the Anglicans of Goulburn (N.S.W.) have
again proved themselves good Australians. In the
choice of the first Bishop, Thomas, who was “sent
out” by the English Government under letters patent,
the local people had no say ; but each of his successors
—Chalmers, Barlow and now Radford—has been
elected by the Goulburn Synod from among the ranks
of laborers in the Australian vineyard, suggestions to
import being turned down each time. Radford, whose
election was foretold in The Bulletin last January,
was discovered in the Cold Country 46 years ago. He
had some repute as a writer on historical subjects
before his arrival in Sydney in 1909. The Anglican
Bishops selected him three years later to give the
Moorhouse Lectures at Melbourne Cathedral, where
his course, “Ancient Heresies in Modern Dress,”
proved a grievous disappointment to those pious souls
who had expected him to deal with the split skirt
and the Seymour blouse instead of Theosophy and
Christian Science. Too broad-minded to fit exactly
into either the “High” or “Low” parties, Radforl
has been a suspect by extremists on both sides. As
he refuses to share Archgaiter Wright’s horror of
copes and chasubles, or see Popes in his sleep, the
Low churchmen who rule the Anglican roost in Syd-
ney have decided that he should be classed as High.
Consequently they blocked his election to any office
under their control. Rejected thus from membership
of the general Australian Synod whenever he sought
election as a representative of Sydney, he now becomes
a member of the Upper House of that body by Goul-
burn’s choice. Radford, the junior Anglican Bishop
in the Commonwealth, will share with Bishop Green,
of Ballarat (now the senior Anglican prelate since
Barlow’s resignation from Goulburn), the distinction
of being the only Anglican Bishops in Australia hold-
ing genuine doctors’ degrees-—Green as LL.D. of
Sydney Uni., Radford as D.D. of Cambridge. The
titles and scarlet robes of all the other Australian
bishops are mere honorary distinctions—on the same
level as the degree held by “Dr.” George 11. Reid.
OUR SAILOR FRIEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ob. it was good to watch bis sunburned face,
To listen to bis yarns so wide and free !
lie brought a breath to our still working-place
Of his wild mistress-slave, the outer sea.
And we, who knew that he would soon be gor.e,
Swung round our chairs to listen while we might,
And if our eyes a little brighter shone,
’Twas for the things he brought before our sight.
Hr vivified the map and lit strange seas ;
The wind sang- shrilly in his seaman tales,
As he sat talking, very ill at ease,
For he was used to wind and threshing sails,
And here all things were dusty, dead and still:
No brave wind blew, and walls were all around ;
A cave to make a free man faint and ill
M as that dark room in which we sat spellbound.
And when at last he went and with him took
His atmosphere of action, John and I
Shot at each other a despairing- look
And heaved (one each) a melancholy sigh,
For he had made a dark room darker still
With sunlit talk of travel, wind and tide.
Some day we hope the sunburned sailor will
Grope his dark way where we for ever hide,
And tell us hermits how life moves outside.
Sometimes I have a foolish, haunting dread
That, when he comes again, we may be dead;
For Time reels by, and Death comes on apace
When one sits always in the same d—d place,
And reads and writes the same d—-d silly things
That give to Time and Death a swallow’s wings.
Though we look down on paper, John and I,
While Fortune and Adventure saunter by,
Some day we will inevitably die,
And out of doors for ever peaceful lie
And rest (hooray!) with faces to the sky !
N.S.W.

■\ , r a §o £1969 fell into reserves and
didn t mention where it came from. It
now looks as if it was a contingency fund
biought into the daylight. This year it
has apparently been separated from the
formal reserves; anyway, a contingency
reserve ot the same amount now figures in
the accounts. If you prefer it, therefore,
you can regard the reserves as £1969 less
than the figure mentioned in the last line.
The co. has three principal sources of
revenue, and the next comparison shows
how each cow is milking:—

Investments . . 1,780 4,855 8,581 9,823 L 893
The investments consist of shares in Lift
Inspection and Insurance, Ltd., £l3 500 •
Automatic Telephones Ltd., £9750. The co’
owns practically all the shares in the Lift
Inspection and Insurance Co., and, according
to the latest information available, 65,000
deferred shares in Automatic Telephones
(Australia), Ltd. In 1914 the latter co.
bjud no div. on deferred shares; so, unless
there were investments not traceable in the
published accounts, there was then a thump-
ing profit from the lift side-line. This year
there has been a slump in the income under
t his head; but in the absence of accounts
for the subsidiary cos. the matter can’t be
pursued further. From the Automatic
Telephones the co. doesn’t seem to have thus
far drawn any dividend; but in view of
the numerous contracts that co. lias with,the
Commonwealth Government, , sotaetlring
should come in very soon now. For the
rest, the co. has shown a large capacity to
collar the opportunities that come its way;
and if they won’t come it doesn’t mind going
out to meet them. Its revenue will probably
be affected by the depression we are bound
to see in the building trade, probably for
some years to come; but it has valuable
agencies and a good connection as an engin-
eering odd-jobber, and if looks as though it
will be able, to keep the pot simmering, even
if the utensil doesn’t boil violently enough to
produce the present 12} p.c. Still with so
many sticks in the fire there is no telling
what it may do. Its financial position is
very easy. Its liabilities on March 31
amounted to £3O,S4S, and, apart from
£21,000 in plant, the whole of this money,
as well as the capital and reserves, was in
real property, stock and work in progress
(£90,491) and liquid assets. Apart from
the goodwill that may be hidden in the hold-
ings in the lift insurance and telephones cos.,
there are no hypothetical assets whatever.
It is a very “clean” balance-sheet.
As mentioned above the co. held 65,000 de-
ferred shares in Automatic Telephones, Ltd.
The deferred shares in this co., nominally of
Is. each, were entitled to half the profits
divided after the ordinary shares had 10 p.c.
In consequence of the disfavor with which
such shares are held, it was recently decided,
on reorganising the co., to make all shares
ordinary. For two ordinary shares in the
old co. paid to 10s., one share fully paid to
£1 in the new co. is to be issued, and every
eight deferred shares of Is. will carry one
ordinary £1 share. As the deferred shares
were valued at 3s. in the Standard-Way-
good balance-sheet, either the holding will
have to be written down there by £1625. or
the ordinary shares will have to be regarded
as worth more than par. One advantage of
the reorganisation wi 11 be to make this co.’s
holding immediately productive.

duced in connection with the Lake Mar-
garet scheme, which came into use during
November and December. This is the big-
gest technical event in the recent history
of the co., and one of the most interesting
in recent Australian mining history. Lake
Margaret is a little b d.v of water, with an
area of less than half a square mile, only
live miles from the reduction works. Its
tremendous value is due to four features:
(1) its altitude is 2150 ft., and in U miles
the river which takes the overflow has a fall
of 1100 ft .: (2) the rainfall on the catch-
ment area averages about 150 in. a year, and
the precipitation is fairly divided . between
the four seasons; (3) the lake has a depth
in places of 150 ft. ; and (4) the mouth was
a narrow _ gorge, so that damming wasn't
an expensive matter. The whole tiling, in-
cluding the power plant and a new blower
plant for the converters, cost about £165,000
ior o 1? mone y the co. has now 5000 li.p.
every 24 hours, and that isn’t the maximum
obtainable from these works. At a com-
paratively small outlay 40 p.c. could also
be added by harnessing up the same water
lower down, where there is an almost
stiaight fall of 400 ft. As to saving the
cost M producing blister last half-year was
f, s - 1 -• Per toil -of' ojie less than it was in
the preceding half-year; and the works, as
mentioned Mist now, were not available more
than two-thirds of the term. There mav
. w “] inor causes operating to reduce
costs but they are not apparent. The ore
sent to the reduction works was 173189

That is magnificent; but whether it would
pay to moke aii outlay of £165.000 in order

many half-years the works could be kept

have averaged 9s. 4d. per ton. The net
profit for the past half-year was at the rate
of 34s 3d. per ton. At 10s. per ton the
pi esent reserves would give 235. per share,
in addition to the measured ore the co. has

whatever further ore may be developed in
the North Lyell and other sections ; and it
has the Lake Margaret power scheme, which
may possibly be utilised in overcoming the
metallurgical difficulties of the West Coast
zinc-lead mines, some of the most important
of which are now held under option.
As to whether the past half-year’s profits
were abnormal, copper has certainly brought
an exceptional price. For many years the
general practice was to value it at £56 Six
“rS 8 ? S 2«o lie T metal then in stock was
' actaall y averaged when
sold £O4 3s. lOd. Of the current half-year’s
production (3939 tons) 2645 tons were sold
at an average of £65 2s. 10d.. and the unsold
| tack b ? e “ taken into the accounts at
half -.v eai ' lias thus undoubtedly
benefited by exceptional prices. Dot the
results of 12 years’ work, shown above, are
likely to give a very fair guide to future
results. Mining costs are certainly higher
now; but there are strong influences at work
to reduce exes, in other directions.

therefore not quite as much to lay by as in
some previous half-years, certainly; but
still not far short of the best. In those best
half-years the directors showed an admir-
able restraint in the matter of dividends, so
that even though the profit for the last term
is less than usual, the dividend still absorbs
only «l)7 p.c. of it. A bank which can in bad
times maintain the dividend it has been
paying in good times, and still put bv 43 p.c.
ot its profit, is entitled to go out and buy
itself the best cigar in Oollins-street.
. there is no visible reason for expect-
ing poorer things in the future. Victoria
has got through its deplorable drought, the
worst the greater part of the State has ever
had. Next year’s wheat crop is not of
course assured yet: it won’t be. till next
October. But. the start is all right; and good
markets for the State’s staples seem certain.
Money will be scarce and dearer than
it lias been, and Government borrowing will
have to be cut down to a minimum: but
this will affect Victoria less than any other
State, since it has leaned least on the pawn-
broker of recent years. Incidentally the
public has awakened to the fact that in
buying foreign goods it provided the enemy
with rifles and cannon; and Australian in-
dustry is going to gain thereby. Which
means that the Australian banker is going
to be given that work and profit which has
been making millionaires of Continental
bankers. The one thing of which anv
respectable bank has to be really alarmed
is a sudden fall in the market value of
securities,-/ If the unthinkable happened,
we should see a slump all right. Apart
from that it isn’t easy to see anything cal-
culated to give this and other Australian
banks any serious trouble. It is, on the
contrary, easy to see many things that ought
to give, them solid prosperity.
Comparing the Colonial’s balance-sheet

That the deposits should be a shade larger
is very creditable, in the circumstances;
™ has been possible to add a trifle to
the advances, at a time when less prudent
banks might easily have been obliged to call
in advances, is still more creditable. Aus-
tralia doesn’t realise yet how well'its banks
have come through this period. Certainly
they had bad years of prosperity in which
to make themselves snug. But people, don’t
always make themselves snug in prosperity
The inexperienced N. ( g. Wales Labor Gov-
ernment, for instance, lised the same pro-
sperity to get so helplessly involved that,
to prevent wholesale distress, the partyllias
diad to repudiate its policy and call in*, a
foreign syndicate of contractors “to provider
employment” on terms of desperation. And-’
the Cggiaial, like most of the others, is still
in a position to lend old clients a hand* It-
owes £4,412,427; and it has £2,050,433" of'
liquid asset's. This is very nearly 47 p.c. of
the liabilities —a very solid holding; so solid
that the bank won’t have to turn down de-
sirable business when it offers, especially in
view of the much improved season in Vic-
toria.

Run down the column showing the profits
put to reserves, commencing from March,
1913. It doesn’t leave one with a very easy
feeling. Quite plainly if things go on this
way the 20 p.c. div. can’t be maintained.
Whether it should have been paid for the
past half-year depends on whether enough
undisclosed profit was laid by to cover all
reasonable contingencies. If they are pro-
vided for this paper is inclined to say that
the right thing was done in maintaining the
dividend, in spite of the poor margin, on the
general principle that this isn’t the time to
cut down a dividend if enough profit has
been made to pay it. And there is no reason
to expect that things will go on getting worse
in the West. True, there is no farming
population in any other State in so bad a
way. But that is not necessarily a reflection
on the agricultural possibilities of the West.
The fact is two-thirds of the farmers there
are new-chums who haven’t yet got into their
stride. They started mostly with very little
capital; and the way capital runs out and
returns don’t run in during the early years
of a farm would astonish most people who
haven’t been there. Most of these Westra-
lian farmers, who have never yet had a good
year to provide the fat for them to live on.
have had to fall back on the storekeepers,
..and the storekeepers have had to fall back
on the merchants, and the merchants have
had to lean on the banks. Some have thrown
the whole business up; hundreds more cer-
tainly would if the State hadn’t come to the
rescue.
Luckily Westralian mining isn’t for
metals which depend on Belgian and
German '’furnaces, otherwise things would
have been worse. As it is, the advantages
of gold-mining have wakened some people,
and there is a better disposition to tackle
Westralian ventures. Further, results have
been encouraging; and one Edna May is
quite enough to feed hope on for a couple of
years. /'As for agriculture, Westralia will no
doubt have to readjust its views. It has
keen handicapped by having responsible
Ministers who talked wildly about the area
of cultivable land, and led farmers into
country which never should have seen a
plough. There will consequently be many
failures; and private banks, like this one,
will suffer. But the chances are that most
of the individually small losses made on
these too-remote farms will fall on the State
Agricultural Bank. At the same time, as
there have been and are going to be many
farming, failures in Westralia, and as the
bottom is always liable to fall unexpectedly
out of mining securities, this Westralian
Bank hasn’t an easy field to work, by any
means.

Of the , past year’s profit £6OOO is to be
dropped into a contingency fund “against
depreciation of securities by drought and
war. If the £6OOO is struck off the profit,
the latter is. reduced to £11.275 ; and even
then the dividends absorb only just half of
if It isn’t a fair thing, though, to ask anv
bne year s trading to stand the racket of a
gpbfbsjsal war and an exceptional drought.
8o the fair profit for the past year is pro-
bably much over £13,275. Nobody can say
what it is exactly. The profit a co. makes
m a year is.dependent on the difference in
the value of its assets at the two dates; and
though one can tell to a penny whether one
has more or less money, whether a stack of
hay or a bag of poems is Worth more or
less than it was a year ago is largely a
matter of opinion. As a rule, it isn’t good
to see a co. making special provision for
writing down assets. It suggests that, as a
general thing, it over-values its assets, which
means that it over-estimates its profits. Still
there are times when special provision is
justified. Recent unusual circumstances,
for example, justify it now-.
John Bridge’s business was turned over
to a private co. 38 years ago; but it was
not until five years ago that the public was
interested. The co. had been such a monev-
spimier on a small capital that when in 3 933
33-667 new shares were issued, a premium
of £30,360 was available for reserves. A
20 p.c. div. was paid that year: and w-hen
next year the rate fell to 30 p.c. it made
the co. look cheap. The solid investor doesn’t
like the flash concern that starts off with
20 p.c. and tumbles next year to 30 p.c
But this at least can be said for John
Bridge’s: like most other private and semi-
private. concerns, it had got into the habit
of paying little or much just as it could
afford. In 1899 shareholders got nil • in
1900, 75 p.c. In 3907 and 3908 ordinaries
got nil; m 1909 and 1910, 10 p.c. p.a. To
some extent this plan seems to be pursued
now. Certainly for the past year the co.
could afford to pay more than 5 p.c. But in
the unusual circumstances, both the directors
who were game enough to recommend 5 p.c.
and shareholders who for the good of the
business were quite ready to leave the big
balance of profit undrawn deserve a vote of
thanks.. Carried accordingly.

the reputation of being one of the most enterprising
and ambitious of life assurance institutions, and to
be enterprising and ambitious is to the modern mind
so very much preferable to being inert and hyper-
cautious that the Australian office may well secure the
respectful consideration of many persons for the com-
modities it offers because of its up-to-date pushfulness
alone. Only 40 years old-—almost a youngster com-
pared with some of our ancient offices—the Colonial
Mutual has, from the commencement of its career
pressed forward with uncommon determination and

Randolph Bedford goes West again:
Perth grows to a beauty of the Indian Ocean as
Sydney is the beauty of the South-Western Pacific;
the distinctive olive-green of the honeysuckle and the
brighter eucalypt-green framing the red roofs on the
yellow sand of South Perth—that finest of suburbs,
made a peninsula by Perth Water and Melville Water
—and Perth itself across the bay, beautiful and
Italian, with white buildings on limestone under a
cloudless sky. The Terrace is still the Rialto ; the
Golden Mile gives conversational place to Bullabull-
ing, the Bullfinch is forgotten for Edna May—other-
wise the Terrace is as it was. The loaded goldfields
train loses many passengers at Oarrabin rather than
Southern Cross; the smoking-dining-bar-room of the
one “wet” express in Australia talks Bodallin, Wes-
tonia and the Soak instead of Bullfinch and Golden
Valley.
From Carrabin it is but six miles on a good motor
road to Westonia. Like Bullfinch it is a tenderfoot
rush. There are no drays and swampers, no more
hardships to keep back the weakling and make the
romance of the strong. Through saltbush, bull-oak,
cypresses, salmon gum and gimlet the racing automo-
biles give us a mad ride through the moonlight into
a sleeping camp—for the time is two in the morning,
and all of life in this camp that drinks seven tons of
beer a week is the smoulder of a fire in the gimlet.
There are two hotels- —one kept by W. Morgan, other-
wise Paddy King, of Hunter River, .who has fought
138 fights, and been beaten by only four men. Besides
the two hotels there are a newspaper—the Westonian,
full of youth and optimism—and a hoopla and auction-
room run by Scotty Linton, who has run auction-
rooms in every mining camp since Silverton, And
through the moonlight and the quiet, air stirring the
dense tops of the salmon gum sounds the reason for
the pubs and Scotty Linton —the softened clamor
of 10-head on the Edna May and 10 stamps falling on
Central ore.
Morning shows the bush of the Westralian fields at
its best; golden air, all wine and sunlight; the grace-
ful summits of the salmon gum, the sunlight on their
pink shafts; and the spiral flutings of the saffron
gimlet-woods.
It is one of the few places in Australia which has
a telegraph line, little talk of the war, and no mili-
tary expert or censor. There are none of the shocking
self-advertisers of Melbourne inviting other men to go
to the wars while they stay at home to talk —these
patriots with foot-and-mouth disease, as unable to
move towards Turkey as to stop talking. The Aisne
interests them not, nor the Carpathians; but Bill
found a good floater on the Tinned Dog Extended
yesterday, and sundry men went out at dead of night
and surrounded Bill’s show with a forest of pegs.
This is a great country for mining timber, and pegs
cost nothing. Most of the old hands of all the rushes
since Broken Hill are here —except the very dead and
the very’' old. Martin Walsh isn’t here, nor Morgan
Darcy; Jonathan Bray is in Melbourne; Fawcett in
Sydney; “Bull Ant” Mclntyre is in Southern Cross,
and goes into his tent when the Edna May Central is
mentioned. Jerry McAuliffe is not here either. But
many of the old hands turn; up again. Richard Wil-
liams of the Central, and Michael of the May ; “Big”
Gaffney of the Hill End; Holmes and Tricks; Arthur
Babington ; McKenzie of Norseman ; Coupar of Black
Range; Ccn Hickey, who cannot talk standing
quietly, and dances in and out of Paddy King’s and
through the dust; Duggan and J. C. Clark. During
their visits Hans Irvine and A. E. Morgans live
mostly at the mines, and are rarely seen in the
streets. By day, Scotty Linton, with his curls
making his hat stand up until it’s tired; and by
night, Scotty Linton advertising the receipt of cus-
tom by three ginger-beer bottle flares in the dust,
and a hoopla and a bed-store within. There are no
boom prices at Scotty’s. His signboard says:—
Single & Double Beds from 5/-
Single & Double Stretchers from 3/-
Bedding from 2/-
And for hours they bang a piano that has been
through two cyclones and a flood, to draw attention
to the sacrificing sale of bedsteads.
For weeks midnight peggings have been frequent—-
the acquisition of something probably worth nothing
conducted with all the secrecy and conspiracy of a
raid on the bullion rooms of the Mint. The country
has been pegged many blocks north of the two pro-
ducing mines, and east and south of them for six
miles.
It is very well-known country. The old road to
Coolgardie goes over the Soak and by Bodallin Rocks
to the granite of Yorkrakine, and the region was over-
run 20 years and more ago by prospectors with their
eyes on the eastern skyrun always. It was Bullfinch
that discovered the Recovery—half a mile east of the
Edna May—and the Edna May Central that discovered
the Edna May. The reefs are covered by alluvium
and cement, and drilling through the cement and
clay has located so many blind reefs that there must
be scores yet hidden. Good values have been struck
by this blind stabbing with an auger 20ft. long, but
there are many of them without gold, and many more
with values of a ’weight or so. As “Bull Ant”
Mclntyre says in furtherance of his systematised pro-
specting scheme, only the sunbrowned gold has been
worked yet, and there’s as good gold as any yet
found awaiting the blind stabber. He has at least
one proof of his theory in the Edna May.
The mine-buyer and optioner in the district has up
to now been frequent in his visits and circumspect in
his behavior. Hereafter he may buy at his own
price, and in a month or two rival sellers may fight
over him, for the boom in options has departed. Up
north a man who wanted to sell a copper show
remarked that he would sell it to me cheap because
he wouldn’t take down a native. He thought that
the English were fair game, and he threatened to sell
his 50ft. hole in the ground for hundreds, er millions,
er thousan’s. The hole-vendor at Westonia has no
compunctions about a native.
“Two t’ousan’ five ’unterd,” he said ; “two ’unterd
an’ 50 powund to-niorry, an’ the rest in a munt’.”
I got him down to a third of the price, and in-
creased the duration of option six-fold, and then I
sampled it, and it bulked under a pennyweight. Pub-
lic interest is on the Edna May, the Central and the
Deeps, and is divided into two camps. If a man be
in Ednas or in Ednas and Deeps, he hates Centrals
with a hatred surpassing the hatred of bears. It
seems to me that the Central must get the Edna May
enrichment in depth, but the bulls of Edna Mays and
Deeps deny it passionately. And the two camps live
together and contradict one another with the fury of
quarrelling children. Now that the boom is dead,
until some new shows not only get on to good gold, but
produce from milling, there will be no more t’ree
t’ousand pounds cash and seven t’ousand in shares for
a hole 40ft. deep and a drive 30ft. on a foot or so
of good ore. Many of these things are just good
enough for half a dozen men, and are quite ridiculous
possessions for a company in 60,000 shares of 10s.,
the fashionable denomination of stock on this field.
For another matter, London isn’t in, and can’t be in
until after the war, and no new goldfield can have a
really big Number One boom unless the mad miners
of Throgmorton-street have a hand. All the better
for the field in the long run. Westonia will be a
long and consistent producer, and holds a big number
of small men’s mines, and, may be, a few hidden
company mines likfe the Edna.
Meantime I found it good to be back in the country
of the red soil and gimlet-woods again, with a wine-
like air to breathe and the sun shining splendidly.

The Morning Star, Magnet (W.A.),
threatens a quick and unexpected resurrec-
tion. As labor had apparently gone to the
Front or quitted Australia for ever and ever,
the engine and plant were sold and the mine
was left, though not in any sense a derelict
below. The old manager now wants it on
tribute with the option of purchase, and to
that end another syndicate has been formed.
* * * *
From all accounts Associated Northern’s
Victorious mine at Ora Banda (W.A.) is
going to pieces. There is plenty of ore in
the bottom workings, but very little gold,
and arsenic and other refractory abomina-
tions darken the outlook. The reserves over-
head are being depleted rapidly. To make
matters worse the co.’s Kalgoorlie mine is
moribund, and its Mexican delusion is in
the hands of the rebels. But possibly the
latter misfortune is, so far as shareholders
are concerned, a blessing in disguise.
* -X- * *
Great Fingall (W.A.) has had the
shutters up for a week or two on account
of a shortage of firewood, fuel being one of
the problems of those parts.

Minerals other than gold of an estimated
value of £25,121 were exported from the
West during the quarter ended March,
carrying the total to £3,647,799. Of this
£1,294,694 represented copper, £1,172,040
tin, £330,633 silver, £531,9.35 silver-lead ore,
£283,376 coal, and £35,121 other minerals.
Present exports mostly consist of silver-lead
ore and miscellaneous, as very little copper
and tin and scarcely any coal have been
sent away since the war began.
Frank Moss and two or three other pro-
minent mining men in Westralia have
bought the Lancefield mine and plant for
£20,000, and begin with a light heart where
8., M. & Co. and its subsequent controller,
the Kalgoorlie and Boulder Firewood Co.,
left off in despair. Moss and party have put
one of their number, George Ridgeway, late
assistant general manager of the Great
Boulder, in charge. Under his supervision
they have started to make extensive altera-
tions to the plant and spend money in other
ways above and below surface. For years
the Lancefield has baffled the efforts of
everyone who tried to make it pay. Hitherto
failure lias been ascribed to refractory ore
and high cost of labor and supplies; but,
according to Moss, the ore is rich enough to
yield a good profit despite these drawbacks.
* * * *
Edna Central, Westonia (W.A.), got
the Melbourne market in trouble over
developments in No. 2 winze. This
working is on the Edna May bound-
ary, and has been giving more or less
showy prospects between the 150 ft. and 225 ft.
levels. Its last effort was to get suddenly
out of poor stuff into Boz. samples, with bor-
ings on the hanging wall assaying up to
.‘ll oz. The manager guardedly advised that
this might all be a patch—and a patch 40ft:.
from the Edna cannot make the Central. Had
the report been that the shaft on the lode in
the centre of the claim had more than lOdwt.
stuff —which it hasn’t, according to official
reports—the market rise would have had
something more stable to support it. /“
* * * *
Tributors dug £12,420 out of North Kal-
gurli (W.A.) during the last financial year,
and sundry other receipts brought the total
revenue up to £12,935. Expenditure, includ-
ing what was paid to tributors, totalled
£13,429, and after allocating £ll6 for in-
come tax there was a deficit of only £6lO
to show for the year’s operations. A num-
ber of parties are still at work on the pro-
perty, but most of them are doing little good
for either themselves or the co.
* #- * *
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) has its main
shaft down to 3000 ft. and is getting
ready to open out. Meantime monthly
profits continue to steadily increase. In
July last the surplus amounted to £2870,
and since then it has gradually crawled up
until last month the total reached £B2ll.
The management reports good ore on No. 4
lode at the 2480 ft. and 2630 ft. levels. At
the former point a shoot ranging from 6ft.
to Bft. in width, and assaying from 635. to
1355., has been driven on for 100 ft., and at
the latter point the last 58ft. opened up on
the same body is reported to bulk 765. 6d.
over 6ft.

Coolgardie lias livened up a bit as a result
of the booming of the Gibraltar and one or
two adjacent delusions. Applications have
been lodged. for dozens of prospecting areas;
and a few leases have been granted. Several
applications for leases and claims have also
come in from the Woodline find, situated in
a dry and dismal stretch of country 20 miles
north of Boorabbin and about 50 miles from
Bayley’s. Some rich stuff is being broken
near the surface in this locality; but the
shoots seem to be short, and it isn’t safe to
depend on them going down. ):1; .

At Charters Towers improving prospects
in Clark’s and the Papuan enliven the local
market. The Papuan raised 100 tons in a
fortnight, and No. 4 level on the cross reef
is being opened up promisingly. Stopes
above" No. 3 level average 9in., but at the
end of the north level there is a bulge 24ft.
wide. Clark’s is becoming a favorite be-
cause the workings extend for more than
900 ft. in length, nearly all payable.
The deepest working at the bottom of No. 2
underlay shaft has recently got into more
settled country, and the reef has improved.
Stopes average from 3in. to Biu. of good
stone.' No. 5 level from the Lady Maria
shaft is now under the pay shoot in Clark’s
levels, and when driven right through will
increase the reserves, now about 4000 tons.

The last of a good Australian:—
Captain Douglas Freeman, one of the first Com-
monwealth officers killed in Turkey, was the first
manager of the Mount Oxide (Q.), and a fine sample
of the plucky, resourceful, determined young Aus-
tralian. Before leaving for the Front he was mana-
ger for the Queensland Copper Co. at Mount Perry.
The way he reached Mount Oxide to start his job
there indicates the sort of man he was. Getting his
party of:a dozen together, he hit out from the rail-
head with horses, tools and stores, only to he met by
the first floods of the wet season; yet he landed the
whole outfit. with the loss of only one horse. Pro-
fessionally. lie stood well both as a cyanider and
underground man. The crime of the maniac of Pots-
dam robs this country of a useful and thoroughly
typical Australian of the best kind.

The hitherto idle manganese deposits at
Back Creek and elsewhere near Rockley
(N.S.W.) have been taken up by Hoskins
and Co., of Lithgow. Manganese as a
material for hardening steel is an item of
value, and manganese steel is used in large
quantities to-day. Molybdenite is another
ore which is iff much request by steelmakers;
and when the steelmaker lives, works and
has his being in N. 8. Wales instead of Ger-
many, America or England, he will be much
more get-at-able, and the producer won’t
have to feed an innumerable swarm of
hungry middlemen.
* * * *
The Bangadang, Adelong (N.S.W.). strums
the harp vigorously in Melbourne, but the
market is shy. The new scrip is now avail-
able ; and this fact brings out the news
that, though Melbourne is off the feed, de-
velopments at the mine are to the entire
satisfaction of the directors. As the pay-
able ore below the adit in the old mine dipped
out of the winze at 20ft., this “entire satis-
faction” is probably due to happenings at
No. 1 North. There two shafts 500 ft. apart
are calculated to carry oz. or better stone.
If the average could be maintained for a
length of 500 ft., well and good ; but two iso-
lated holes 500 ft. apart are not enough.
Wagga people, who are also much interested,
seem less cocksure about the show than when
they dashed in to put up £5OOO for Wesley to
test the formation. Still, they are content to
hang on Wesley’s words of wisdom until the
time comes for a big outside expert’s over-
haul of the claim. As a side-show, some
money is being dribbled into tbe Jack-a-lass
find a little distance off, into which A. E.
Langford has also got a bit more than his
little-finger tip.
* * * *
Clarence United, Bendigo, is treating ore
on the low side, and therefore only just about
covers expenses from half-year to half-year.
Work in the deep ground especially has been
on patchy stuff, and the shallow ground off
the Clarence and New Argus shafts fails to
yield rich enough spurs to pile up any profit.
To get out of this deadly-dull stage the co.
is trying to induce its neighbors to join in
testing the Paddy’s Gully line from the
eastern Clarence shaft. Premier Peacock
will be asked to back the work. He ought
to, as the collapse of the Moon end of the
field is one of the heaviest blows Bendigo has
had of late years.

A WOMAN'S
LEŢER
Sydney, May 24. 4915.
My Dead Axuni, —
G.-G. Ferguson, after hunting for a roof
to shelter him during his few days here,
decided to camp at the Warrigal Club in
Maequarie-street. This is a quiet, unpre-
tentious nook frequented chiefly by the
woolly pastoralist who can take his coffee
on a roof garden that I’d rather have than
any other in Sydney. The Stricklands have
always pressed hospitality on the houseless
Fergusons when they come this way. But
as a matter of principle the G.-G. insists on
finding a roof for himself.
The Queen’s Club, which is designed
rather like a step-ladder, is to shelter Lady
Helen from June Ist to the 4th. In this
haughty menagerie the most cosy spot is
said to be the kitchen. There the only lift
creaks with the roast and boiled that ascends
(when nothing goes wrong) to the sad-
colored dining-room. The Fergusons are
understood to be eager to get a permanent
humpy to come to in this city. Meanwhile
the vandals are si ill slaughtering trees round
empty Government House.
The late Major-General Bridges, though
usually spoken of as a Canadian, was a son
of a naval man, Captain Bridges, who once
lived at The Mill,.Moss Yale. He married
a Miss Throsby, of those parts. Their son,
whose death has been recorded with regret,
got his first snack of military life at the
Royal Military College, Kingston, Canada.
Soldier William Throsby Bridges was of late
rather a delicate man, in spite of his big
frame and giant strides on a parade ground.
His death, after a severe wound, made an
heroic terminus to a brilliant career.
Noel Bridges, eldest son of the late Aus-
tralian General, hadn’t seen his father for
over six years till they recently had a
dramatic meeting in Egypt. Young Bridges
had been in Westralia for some time. Then
father went to England. When he re-
turned Noel had gone to the Malay States.
He hurried off to England to enlist when
the war-drums boomed, and in due course
went to Egypt. General Bridges, writing to
a friend here, said he was sitting in his tent
after dinner when lie had one of the glad
surprises of his life. Someone outside asked
if lie might come in. It was the long-absent
son.
Four or five years ago another Canadian
officer, Colonel Stacey, came to Sydney,
bringing with him a wife, two very charm-
ing young daughters, two sons—and inci-
dentally a new breakfast food. Breakfast
foods with fancy names haven’t the vogue in
Australia that they have on the other shore
"f the Pacific, so the Canadian moved on to
Fiji to become a planter. One son went
witli him: the rest of the family stayed to
brighten up a harbor-side suburb. The
son who went was presently drowned while
bathing. Lately, the plantation having
been made shipshape, Mrs. Stacev and the
two daughters joined their Colonel. Last
month, with island boys for crew, they went
in their boat to post their mail, it was
only a five-mile sail; but a sudden storm
came up and held them back. They ran
ashore and spent one night in a native vil-
lage : next day they decided to risk the
weather —and this time all three were
drowned, the mother and the two daughters.
It is a heartbroken old colonel who wrote
an account of the tragedy to the girls’ friends
by the last Islands mail.
Empire Day rally in the Royal Exchange
filled that shipping centre to its back door —
which, of course, inevitably leads man on to
a bar. In the matter of seats for the elect
the usher appeared to have no instructions.
So the Belgian Consul meekly planted him-
S( df —an official wallflower tipped with
lemon-colored gloves—right at the back. The
•Tan. Consul, apparently about to hang him-
self up amongst the hats and wraps, was
mercifully snatched from oblivion bv Mr.
Alfred Meeks.
Governor Strickland made some remarks,
very much to the point, on Self Help for Aus-
tralians. "It's a coincidence,” said his Ex.,
“that the Queen Elizabeth should now be
shelling the Turk’s stronghold. The Queen
after whom she is named stood at the begin-
ning of the era of British Empire-building
and the emancipation of woman. Queen Vic-
toria, whose birthday we celebrate, stood at
the other end.” After referring to the fact
that when these two wilful ladies reigned,
Bidtish statesmen quarrelled less than usual
amongst themselves (nresumably because a
Royal missus is of herself a' handful to
manage), our sub-regal chief handed a bou-
quet of words to Rear-Admiral Creswell as
the man who had striven longest, for an Aus-
tralian navy. A reference to that good friend
of the Commonwealth, the Admirable King-
Hall, brought forth a round of applause.
Creswell sat through it all. a genial old tar,
as careless about the hang of his coat as a
ship’s bos’n.
Empire Day this year was turned to some
useful purpose, so that for once in a way
the King, who disapproves of it as a general
thing, might have given it countenance had
his place of business been here instead of in
England. For several days past the schools
have buzzed with minor bazaars, for which
the girls have been making tarts and the
boys doing chores. In order to be ready with
an offering of £lO,OOO to the Belgian Fund,
ever-willing school inarms have been sitting
up o’ nights to design programmes and
conspire together to invent (if possible)
new ways of winning cash from the public.
The Young Idea had been already pretty well
cleaned out of pocket money for Belgian
Day. Still, the generous Australian kiddie
is throwing his last ha’penny into the bat-
tered hat.
Governor Strickland and eldest daughter
Mary went to the Lewisham Hospital's
annual meeting the other afternoon. Aide
Pasco. 11. N., hung about with ropes of
bullion, was in attendance. Judge Edmunds
read the usual Budget Speech, and tactfully
reminded those present that June 30 was
the date of the Hospital concert.
A Maorilander who has been holding his
end up in Ireland for some years, Sir Lam-
bert Ormsby, is honorary consulting surgeon
to the M.L. Expeditionary Force. Ormsby,
who was born in Auckland, is a son of a
former Surveyor-General in the, Quakey
Dominion. A while ago he was president
of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ire-
land. and became entangled in a knighthood
during the operation.
At the Undergrads’ Town Hall uproar
in aid of the Belgians, “Tipperary” was on
Saturday served up in Latin, and many
other things that don’t matter now were
dressed in jingles. Chancellor Cullen got
a fair hearing for his opening remark,
which was mostly to the effect that the
rowdy exterior of a Sydney ’Varsity youth
concealed a warm heart or something of the
sort. When a blatant youth in the body
of the hall yelled through every item in the
programme, the audience got the idea that
the noise was the trade-mark or sign manual
of a soft head.
Ellen Terry has been talking in Boston
about Australia. This Commonwealth is
going to be the land of songsters. “Everyone
in Australia has a voice. It seems to be a
birthright, and the country has developed an
art of its own.”
Robert Parker, who helped the Skylark’s
Melbourne raid for Belgium, is coming this
way to lift his stentorian voice in the Polish
cause at the Town Hall on June 3.
At the Architects’ Biennial Exhibition, to
open in the Town Hall on October 25, they
propose to show us how the Home can be
made a thing of beauty at no expense worth
mentioning. The N.S.W. Institute, keen
on the scent of new ideas, invites Woman to
enter into the planning of the ideal house.
This is Our chance to whisk into the argu-
ment, and show the thoughtless sex the right
way to approach our household gods.
Grace Burrows is in charge of the Town
Mali space-plan for the show. The ground
floor will house the models of the castles in
Spain and the furnished rooms as thev ought
to be.
Commander Longmore, who had been sun-
ning himself at Manly, has been attracting
favorable notice on the other side. He
joined the navy as a youngster, and later
included aviation in his lieutenant’s kit.
Now, he is amongst the gallant bird-men men-
tioned for the successful attack on the
enemy’s submarine base.
The heavy list of Australian casualties in
the Dardanelles has caused a flutter in the
Red Cross camp. A big meeting is timed
for May 20 —before this bothers you. Gov-
ernor Strickland is to preside. During July
a special appeal to help our own wounded
will give N. S. Wales a chance to beat the
Belgian Day record.
Popular Bobby Bowden, who registered
the N.S.W. State-school teacher’s change of
duties, goes to meet the foe with the good
wishes of the whole Department. A blithe
bachelor, Bobby was not supposed to be proof
against a pretty face. Still, even the nicest
young school marm, in her best hat and
finery, often met a firm “No,” gracefully em-
broidered with compliments when she asked
for a too-previous “move.” Bobby’s memory
was prodigious. He not only had the quali-
fications of every teacher who interviewed
him at his finger-tips, but knew the age and
most of the personal habits of even the ladies
of the flock. Being a man of tact, he usually
buried the latter under his office hat.
The indefatigable Dr. Emma Buckley
packs up for the war zone within the next
few weeks. June sees her on her way to the
big Australian hospital in France, where she
will serve as bacteriologist. Since the war
began Dr. Buckley has been working a hard
12 hours daily. In her overtime she has
been honorary lecturer to the Girls’ Realm
Ambulance classes on two evenings a week ;
so the Young Person will soon have to sit in
bandages at the feet of another instructor.
Captain Harold Caft'yn, killed in action in
France, was a son of the lady who made a
small stir as the writer of “The Yellow
Aster.” Mrs. Mannington Caft'yn was a
nurse hereabouts many years ago. Her
literary splash occurred after her marriage
with a local doctor whose name used to grace
many an early Bulletin story.
Lance Harrison, B.Sc., who won the Coutts
Scholarship before leaving Sydney Uni., is at
Cambridge, where he will- pursue germs and
other public nuisances for two years. But
it’s not all work: when the last mail left
London he and his wife (who used to be
Amy Mack) were holidaying at Land's End.
Sister Louise Mack is now on the way here,
to tell us what she saw in Belgium. Ger-
trude, the youngest of the late Wesleyan
parson’s large family, is staying on the other
side under the wing of Mrs. Harrison. A
brother, Hans, is a Harley-street specialist.
There are almost as many Sydney doctors
in the North of France as in Macquarie-
street. One of the chiefs in an important
hospital for tin; wounded thereabouts is
Roger Cope, of this hamlet.
If still another base hospital is accepted
from Australia— and it most likely will be—
the matrons of the big public institutions
don’t anticipate any difficulty in supplying
ihe nurses, heavy as the drain has been
already. To a great extent Prince Alfred
and Sydney have been turned into training
institutions; and probationers are coming up
splendidly to take the bedsides of those who,
having had upwards of three years’ training,
are qualified for foreign service. Something
like 80 eligible misses are on the list of
those whom Prince Alfred can call upon as
vacancies occur.
The Home for Incurables, which stands
in a leafy garden near Ryde, has just added
a new wing. Governor Strickland, with
Aide Pasco at his heels, made the official
remarks that declared the new bricks to bo
well and truly mortared. The laying of
foundation stones, with considerable cackle,
used to be a regular occupation for Gover-
nors, archbishops and other amateur stone-
masons. But a change has come here, too,
with the great war. When the new wing or
the back kitchen is completed nowadays,
some, preoccupied official hurries along to
give it his blessing, and a collection is taken
by stealth. The Ryde mansion owes a fair
share of its comforts to the attentions of
Hugh Dixson and Miss Margaret Harris.
Captain Burnham, a former Aide, who
had such a close call earlier in the fray, is
now reported well enough for home duty. A
few weeks ago he was stationed at Canter-
bury.
Pianist Elsie Stanley Hall, who married
a well-to-do German, is in the backwoods of
Rhodesia, where her husband has big in-
terests. The Sydney musician’s chief joy, a
piano, hadn’t got that far when the last
word from her came this way. She is two
and a half days’ journey from civilisation,
and everything has to be carried to her door
by the local nigger. Fuzzywuz has apparently
jibbed at hauling a grand piano over moun-
tainous country studded with unfriendly
vegetation.
Someone says it is likely that Tlieo
Cowan’s bust of Henry Parkes will find a
place in the National Gallery. The leonine
head with its mass of white hair certainly
made a striking subject for a modeller. The
centenary of the ancient politician’s birth-
day (May 22) feebly stirred public interest
in the picturesque old woolly merino. One
of the few of his own drawings that Phil
May thought might be worth glancing at
twice represented the old man with his
aureole side by side with the villain he
might look if he were shaven and shorn.
This and half a dozen others of his draw-
ings. May had with him when he went back
to England. Afterwards it made another
voyage, and hangs now somewhere in a
Sydney suburb.
Expert sock-knitters feel their way
through their stiches even during the
loudest guffaws of “The Man Who Stayed at
Home,” at the Royal. They pause only
for an instant to remark that there’s but one
thin place in Eily Malyon’s character sketch
of the angular Fraulein Schroeder. She
knits with hands up, English fashion, instead
of down, German way. I don’t know
whether naturalisation makes any difference
to a woman’s way with a sock.
A voice from Ocean Island coo-ees across
the deep. “In this lone spot, where there
are less than half a dozen European women,
we have a ladies’ page in our local Gazette
-—a miniature newspaper that has no chance
of chronicling race frocks at first hand.
For some time after the war began, the
exiles on Ocean Island had only the haziest
notion as to who were in the fight, or what
it was about. We knew, from various ship-
ping signs, that there toas a war —that was
all. In this state of uncertainty we watched
the vain efforts of a steamer that brought us
mails as she tried to land them. But the
weather was too bad, and we saw her bump
away again, taking for the time our only
source of information.”
An Australian named Kirkpatrick, who lias
the D.S.O. to his credit, is Lieut.-Colonel in
command of a S'African Scottish regiment.
He is a son of Alfred Kirkpatrick, of the
1 tailing River district.
Raul Wen/., a former squatter at Forbes,
was in Rheims, his birthplace, when the
enemy blew up the Peace Society. Now
lie's helping with Red Cross work in France.
The Revue pe Paris lias printed the first
chapters of an Australian story from bis
versatile pen.
In the midst of war's alarms in Italy,
sculptress Dora Ohlfsen had a cable telling
her of her mother’s death. Art being prac-
tically moribund on I lie Continent since Wil-
helm danced the war tarantella, the Austra-
lian woman put on the Nightingale’s cap.
She took her diploma in the Samaritan School
of Nursing, and then put in a strenuous- time
on duty amongst the injured after the Italian
earthquake. Now sin l is ready for Red
Cross work with the new army that is on
the move to hit its hereditary foe, Austria.
The Babies’ Kit Society, cradled in the
Equitable Building, is rushing about 20 bales
of clothing off to the other side. Some time
this week will see this monthly exit to Lon-
don. There the goods are sorted and dis-
tributed by former Sydney school inarms, the
Misses Hodge and Newcombe. These two
send the cheering news that, up to date,
every kit has reached the right place, either
to comfort the desolate babes in Belgium or
for infant refugees in England. Your
smallest scraps of flannel will be gratefully
pounced on by Mrs. Tom Raiue or Mrs. A.
IF Norman at the above address. The
patches are worked up with cunning needle-
craft into linings for youngsters’ quilts.
Pale tan boots, very high, with tassels
flopping in front, are to the fore in these
days of short skirts. They are at any rate
easier to live with than the boot that simu-
lates white spatted tops. The latter have,
a careless habit of getting mud blobs on their
uppers, with grimy results. The doe-
skin footwear, in all-white, is a wild extrava-
gance of the moment. Worn with dark
tailor-mades, it has a spooky effect—particu-
larly if the lady takes a large six. Every-
thing in the way of drapery is loose and fly-
away. Even the wide-tailed coats are en-
couraged to fall in folds. All this is good
reading for the owner of a clothes-prop figure.
For the short and plump, it is an edict of
(iblivion.
Australian-born Justine Kong Sing sends
a line from London, recording the fact that
she got into the Royal Academy show with a
couple of miniatures. One depicted the
Oriental calm of the countenance of the
Chinese Ambassador’s wife. Lately the Syd-
ney girl put in a week in Kent at the old
home of Darwin —the man who persistently
introduced us to our poor relations at the
Zoo. It is now a Girls’ College. The Sur-
vival of the Fittest?
Another politician goes back to his old
trick of verse-writing. W. M. Fleming,
who used to be guilty of poems in The
Bulletin before he was corrupted by a
seat in the House of Reps., has turned out a
topical recruiting ballad, “Wanted for the
Fighting Line.” The music is by May
Summerbelle. Both have put vigor into
their work.
“The Silver Bullet,” under the wing of
the Millions Club, ran a recent season at
the Repertory Theatre. The unpunctual
turned up rather later than usual, and the
Club's secretary, Albert Goldie, had a busy
time apologising to half the audience for the
other half walking over its corns 40 minutes
after the tableaux started. These pictures
were the most striking things in a varie-
gated programme. Dulcie Deamer lent her
aid and recited suitable verse near a pre-
historic cave filled with red electric light.
Mrs. Boult was stage overseer. The proceeds
go to the usual patriotic funds.
Beaufort Burdekin. of Sydney, was
wounded last week in Flanders. He was an
Oxford “blue”—he rowed in last year’s eight
—when the war started, and was amongst the
first of the undergrads, to volunteer. He and
his elder brother Svdnev are both subalterns
in the R.F.A.
Charity balls appear to have vanished
in the smoke of the Great Conflagration.
May, which is usually palpitating with this
good excuse for painlessly extracting 10s.
per head from dancers, is burying its days
and nights in patriotic raids. The slump
in dancing-shoes is considerable in conse-
quence.
The last English mail brought bags of
hurried good-bye notes written by the boys
in Egypt after getting their marching orders
for Turkey. Only one brand of writing-
paper was popular. A kangaroo at the top,
with the printed promise “Australia will be
there.” And it was—the brave fellows !
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, May 24. 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
We had a busy Empire Day. Boy Scouts
did earlv house-to-house suburban work at
bieakfast-time, thus taking much business
away from the girls who didn’t get into the
streets till the morning fog had lifted.
The De Bavay girl <>nd Colonel Ballen-
ger s daughter held up Coilins-street from the
Equitable to Change. Mrs. Carty Salmon
and Mrs. Ainslie took their stand, collecting
boxes in hand, at Scott’s. Mrs. Major James
invaded Menzies’ with an army of Overseas
Club girls, and had an afternoon-tea party
W 1 1 I ? USIC# Anyone who came near the
P a >ty had to pay his or her footing with
cash for the Empire.
Amy Castles motored to the Stock
Exchange and sang the members almost
bankrupt. Irma Caron dressed herself up
as Joan of Arc. clambered on to a milk-
white circus steed led by a hybrid herald,
who was partly beefeater and the rest long
brown boots; dashed her knightly glaive
scornfully at the feet of Stinginess and set
forth gallantly in quest of the Grail whose
other name is Ready Money. The roof or
super-structure of her horse was draped
Avith a saddle-cloth of pale blue velvet
edged with ermine—or it may have been
whitewash. Need I say that when the
guttering outfit transpired at the Stock
t e +i age * b . e enthusiasm was terrific, some
ot the members taking their visitor to be
Catherine of Russia in the costume in
which she first met Prince Poniatowski;
others mistaking her for good Queen Bess
as she appeared when reviewing the
Armada from the White Cliffs of Old Eng-
land. for hours the sounds of singing and
the clinking of gold upon tin issued from
the Exchange, or anyhow it seemed hours
to the wretched herald, who was sliudder-
nig outside in the cold with the steed. Up
at the Grand Hotel the Forrest dame gave
a dinner-party and from early morning a
tavern 1 ® U I tton made the
tavern a base for highway operations.
Yes, it was indeed a splendid and success-
lul function, and those who escaped doing
tlieir financial “bit” were few and far
between.
The Colonel who rushed away to take
command of the Australians in Turkey was
°? e o f * IX Cegges that stalked S’Af.fca
at the time of the disagreement there. The
most unusual of the sextet had been five
years in a Trappist monastery. There is a
romance to it, of course. The lady of his
dreams having entered a convent, this
world held nothing for him, and he simply
had to prepare himself for the next one.
He still wore the habit of these self-denying
Stoics when the trouble started in S.’Africa
One day a brother used some of the few
moments in which speech is permitted to
say rude things about the English side of
the case. Legge bumped the brother’s head
against a wall for the good of his intellect,
and made off to the nearest enlisting officer.
He was accepted, and- after the war went to
London. Legge, senior, was an orchardist
ar Gosfnrd. m N. S. Wales. I suppose the
battle with fruit-bugs developed the fighting
spirit in the boys.
The new Commander’s wife was a Miss
h erguson one of two sisters of a reason-
ably well-to-do Bondi man. The other one
is Mrs. Cosh,. wife of a Sydney architect,
tip has a military man for a partner, and
with a military man’s sister for a wife he
ought to know exactly when the war’s
going to be over.
I see by the cable that General Bridges,
as he lay bleeding to death at sea, with a
shattered leg, “learned before the end came
that he had been made a K.C.8.” Lord
urtord, Disraeli’s bosom friend, was at
dinner when a letter came from the Prime
Minister offering him a K.G. lie put down
his feeding implements just long enough to
scribble on the back of the note, “For
Heaven’s sake, give it to someone else,” and
lesumed his meal. A K.G. is the highest
order in the gift of the Crown; a K.C.B. is
—well not nearly so esteemed. Imagine a
dying hero s end being sweetened by the glad
news that he had got wliat hundreds of far
smaller men struggle desperately to avoid '
Yet the egregious London cable-man
evidently thought that our poor General must
nave been immensely comforted by the news.
Mrs. Faire recently embroidered a bed-
spread and pillowcases and raffled the lot at
one penny. She got £lOl in pence in this
way for the Mayoress’s special war fund.
1 he winning number is 19,467, and if the
successful gambler, who has not yet come for-
ward to claim his or her penn’orth, does not
presently transpire the goods will be re-
raffled without respect of persons. This noti-
fication is final.
The local girls who trade as “Pauline”
have just built a dress for Melba. She savs
the thing is a Dream and that she will wear
ui at J,‘P r bjB ' s >'dney concert. Rather a
blow this to (lie Paris frock convention.
Can it be that the day approaches when
Europe’s Best will be getting its latest crea-
tions from Australia?
A patriotic fete will be given at The
Grange, South-road, Brighton Beach, on
June 5. The wild excitement of tennis and
croquet will be somewhat counteracted by
a classical concert indoors. The object is
to raise money to provide comforts for Aus-
tralian soldiers in hospital.
A new Industrial and Technical Exhibi-
tion was opened last week in the Queen’s
Hall of the old Public Library. The space
which used to be occupied by stuffed fowls
and long-dead bones is now the groundwork
of a double branched stairway, whose grey
and white marble steps lead to the new
museum. Exhibits include woods and mar-
bles of Australia in impressive polished
blocks and boulders of earth and clay, cata-
logued with their place of dislodgment and
virtues. Australian mother-earth is fruitful
beyond the dreams of most countries.
The Overseas Club, on its feminine side,
welcomed the John Madden dame home to
Australia last week. There was plenty of
tea and some good music. The latter in-
cluded a girl with a real voice—Lena King-
ston. Miss Lena, whose elder sister Olive
sang at the Gerardy concerts of yore, is
lately back from two years’ training in
London, and her warble is going to be talked
of when things shake down.
If it were at all teachable the much-
bluffed public could learn something from
an action tried in Melbourne County Court
last week. Edith Eastwick claimed a few
pounds for work and labor done from the
local lady who figured awhile as “Yestelle”
and ran a hopeless show at the Athenaeum
Hall, with herself as star attraction. “Yes-
telle” for a moment was the talk of the
town, thanks to a large expenditure on news-
paper stories and the lovely lot of costumes
she had imported for the show. Edith East-
wick, the plaintiff, “blew the gaff” concern-
ing the wondrous imported costumes. With
the help of seven girls and as manv sewing
machines she had made the togs for “Yestelle”
and co. in one room at the George Hotel,
St. Kilda, where the “cutting out” of those
ravishing creations from Paris was effected
on the floor. Seventy-four garments were
completed in .14 days. The complainant
costnmihre got a verdict.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
the Mooltan took away a lot of interesting
people, including Mr. Mulholland, the A.D.C.
who talks of coming back when the war is
over. Red Cross nurses were about in dozens,
and Dr. Stawell came up from the ship and lunched
with the Edward Hawkers—you remember that Mrs.
Hawker is his sister. Irene Browne also paid a final
visit to her friends here.
Mr. Leigh Winser is to be Private Secretary at
Government House, vice Mr. Mulholland, departed.
He is an Englishman who has been fruit-growing at
Belair. He married Miss Langhorne, a great-
granddaughter of Bishop Short’s.
One Captain Badge, a local old-age pensioner, has
discovered that an estate of £200,000 or so is
waiting for him in England. He came here in
1850, and since then has been engineer, bridge-
builder, hotel-keeper, hotel-broker and other things.
His son has left in pursuit of the money which is
said to have been in Chancery for 24 years.
Pilot P. Dickson, who died at the Semaphore on
Wednesday, had been in the service since ’77. His
first voyage to Australia was in- the Lady Emma, a
small brig of 136 tons that came to Port Adelaide
by way of Durban and Mauritius, and was subse-
quently sold in Melbourne. The engines and boilers
for two of the first Murray steamers constituted part
of her cargo.
Exploier Mawson is back and will resume work
at the University at the end of May. His wife is
due in a few days, and they are to inhabit one of
the Ruthven Mansion flats.
Ml 'S. Osborne, M.Sc., whose husband is
®° tany at the Uni versity, has been appointed to
I the vacancy on the Board of Governors of the
Adelaide Botanic Gardens created by the death of
Mr. T. R. Scarfe.
Douglas Gawler, M.L.C., who died at Perth on"
Sunday, was a grandson of Colonel George Gawler
who was Governor of South Aus. for three years from
1838. He was a native of this State.
Sergeant I. C. MacGillivray, whose death is re-
ported from Turkey, was a son of the member for
Port Adelaide in the House of Assembly.
Mr A. G. Downer has offered Hope Lodge, Belair,
for the accommodation of wounded and convalescent
soldiers. A house at Hectorville has been offered
tor tlm same purpose, and someone at Glenelo’ is
willing to put up 20 convalescents. Hope Lodge
has over 6° rooms, and is in one of the pick places
of the hills close to Adelaide. Fine old Barr Smith
has also made his big home available, and will pay
for any alterations that may be needed. It will take
close-up 100 beds.
Beryl Ireland, the miniature portrait
painter, lias gone to a Sydney studio near
the Queen’s Club. Not to have had a minia-
ture done by Mrs. Ireland is equivalent, if
you are a Melbourne woman, to an admis-
sion of being either plain, obscure or broke.
Her forte is the young married woman of
the fluffy type, and she has also had some
successes with children. The Denmans were
the first to find her.
They have killed poor “Tommy” Curweu
at the war, and social Melbourne feels very
sad. He was one of the most pooular Gen-
tleman Helps that Victoria lias known. He
outlasted a State Governor and assisted the
Fergusons till the war called him. and never
once did he let his onerous duties get on
his nerves. He was cheery and young and
fair and unaffected and had a sense of
humor and a small butterfly moustache. Also
he could act better than most professionals.
It is not easy to realise that the vital, laugh-
ing youngster is dead.
lan Mackinnon, a member of the Argus
family, is interned in German West Africa.
He was in the service of a Teutonic shipping
firm there when the war started.
Erica Hughes, daughter of the Colonel, is
working in an English Convalescent Home.
Not being a nurse she can’t personally attend
to Mr. Atkins, So she is doing such homely
jobs as answering the doorbell, dusting the
furniture and sorting out the mail.
Mrs. Bob Blackwood, the handsome wife
of the little sporting pastoralist who makes
a hobby of anti-Sosh, is on her way to
London. She feels that the mere gift of
money is too paltry, and says she must “do
something,” no matter what, so long as it is
personal.
Geoff Kiddle has been wounded again—
for the third time. He is now at a French
base hospital with a gaping cut in the back
ot his neck, inflicted by a German officer’s
sabre. He was left for dead in a. trench, but
awoke in time to register a feeble protest
against being buried alive.
Young Rupert Carington has also been
potted again. On the first occasion he wasn’t
hit at ail, in the proper sense of the word,
lie was peering through a periscope when a
teuton bullet grazed it, and the falling glass
injured his'eye.
John Madden lectured on The War at
the Austral Salon last Thursday evening.
Everyone was there in beautiful clothes,
and the cheeriness of the gathering almost
made me forget that the unspeakable foe is
firmly wedged in Belgium. The lecturer
§ ave a resume of the proceedings in Europe
since the beginning of Things, and he did
it out of his round, brainy-looking head. I
simply gasped at his memory as he reeled
off facts, dates, actions, places, conditions,
without hesitation, reference books or notes
Everyone was impressed by the extra-shiny
polish of his Parisian accent, as evidenced
when he began to deal with the French
towns. _ The lecture was concise and clear,
like a judicial summing-up ought to be, and
the giver of it ended by solemn]y passing
the death sentence on the war, the same to
take _ effect in August next. You can
imagine how relieved we all were at the
news. Dr. Ryan, who came with the
Madden party, clapped so loudly that I
expected him to be rebuked for riotous
behavior. Coffee was served out after this,
and the whole house glowed with confidence
and good feeling,
The Chevy Chase Binnies are mourning
the loss of their handsome son George, who
fell at the Dardanelles. He was managing
his father’s _ business in Sydney when the
war called him away.
The Winter Irvine girl who married
Baron von Ompteda is a widow. He had
seven months of thrilling escapes; then he'
was severely wounded ; and now he is dead.
Miss Marjorie Heales, of Toorak, is
engaged to Lieutenant Eddy, son of that
Major Eddy who started to do big things
at the time of the Boer war.
The Town Hall was crowded on Saturday
for the first Orchestral Concert. The man-
agement had the doors of the draughty barn
well closed, and a new arrangement of elec-
tric heaters glowed warmly in the afternoon
dusk. . Conductor Slapoffski got a roaring
reception. lie has cut his hair. Instead of
waving round his face like a forest of tall
trees, it now merely adheres to his head after
the style of a patch of scrub when a fire has
ravaged it. The effect is not unbeautiful,
on the whole.
Robert Parker sang “Calf of Gold,” from
"Faust,” and he did it so convincingly that
I could almost see the horns and the scarlet
cloak of Mephisto as the artist stood there
in circumspect afternoon dress, clasping in
his hands what might have been either a
billet-doux or a receipted washing-bill. How
the girls do love him. to be sure! Many of
them were reduced almost to hysteria. “I
thought I should never hear him again when
he left,” wailed one fair creature, and the
sentiment was general, though they didn’t
all wail it.
There were plenty of men, for some rea-
son or other. Hamilton Russell Avas by
himself, in a lovely autumn brown suit and
stiver hair. Harrison Moore lurked fur-
tively in a balcony so that I was
unable to get a good view of his clothes,
and can only say that the general effect
was distinctly alluring. Tommy Coch-
rane wore brown and sat with a party
that had a girl in an adorable rose-pink
hat. Mrs. Edward Miller and her son (who
wore a taking costume of some neutral
shade) occupied a strongly fortified position
in the balcony, well defended from the most
deafening parts of Tschaikowski. Mother
knitted with a sort of holy industrv that
was most edifying. The wool was blue and
her hat was green and her imposing vest
was royal purple, crimson and gold, and as
you may imagine the effect was gorgeous.
“How bitterly anyone must regret it tvho
ever said evil of any of these lads! How
they must regret their foolish utterances!”
said John Madden, orating at the Austral
Salon on the achievements of Tommy Kan-
garoo at the Dardanelles. Let’s hope that
John, at any rate, has repented, for the Aus-
tralian youth, of both sexes, never had a
more severe critic than the wordy Waxcel-
lencv. The horrible immorality of our lads
and lasses,_ their habits of promiscuous flir-
tation, their lack of reverence, and their
general slackness was for long a favorite
theme with John on the freqfient occasions
when he was seized with a rush of oratory
to the thi'oat.
A managerial story told about Amy
Castles amounts to a very definite allegation
that the war was made in Germany. While
she was dwelling in Vienna as an' Imnerial
Court Opera singer, happy in the prospects
of a long engagement and a pension to fol-
low, she was visited by a Court official who
mysteriously advised her to “take a holi-
day.” The songstress “tumbled” to the fact
that she had better get out of Austria
promptly. On the day she left Toulon, with
Australia in view, the war broke out.
Died recently in London Carrie Emmanuel,
a brilliant Sydney soprano of 40 years back.
When Coppin engineered his big Inter-
national Music Festival in Melbourne at the
end of 1572, Carrie and James Fairfax
headed the N.S.W. representation. A few
months later Lyster engaged her for opera
with Beaumont, Alice May, Ilainford and
Templeton. She made her debut in “Gene-
vieve de Brabant,” as the premiere of that
work. She shone in roles of the “Norma”
style, and is said to have introduced Ganz’s
“Sing, Sweet Bird” to Australian audiences.
Mendelssohn, a photographer, married her,
and on leaving Australia she sang in Europe
under the new name.
Lady Helen entertained the wives of the
visiting politicians at Government House on
Wednesday afternoon. No men were asked,
or if they were they didn’t turn up. An
orchestra played softly in a supper-room
where tea was spread, and talk went on in
the large state drawing-room. That room
has sapphire and ivory tapestries, and Lady
Helen’s gown matched them in sapphire and
black brocade. Mrs. Fane wore a tulle hat,
a very skimpy split skirt and a cape—all in
effective black. Lady Doris Blackwood,
distracting in blue and lace tuckers, helped
her to pour out the tea.
John Forrest’s wife wore a startling large
ruby in a pendant and some dark tailorings.
She said her young niece had just landed
from the Osterley—very ill with fright and
the effects of sea-sickness. I didn’t gather
what frightened her. Possibly the prospect
of being seasick. Mrs. Keating wore the
smallest hat on record. It was really not
so_ much a hat as a hatlet, and had two
sailor-tails lashed to its brim. The rest of
her was in navy blue. Mrs. Rogers also
wore this reliable old color, while Mrs.
Pearce looked like a fragment of quicksilver
in grey; and Mrs. Andy Fisher was large
and composed in navy blue —in fact, the
gathering was absolutely stiff with this
color. That and furs. There seemed to be
every known fur on earth, from plain domes-
tic cat to black sable at about a fiver the
square inch.
Dr. Tom Dunhill. of Collins-street, where
he specialised in goitres, went off to the land
of the Pharaohs with the first detachment of
Australian surgeons, and has been having a
rough time. Shortly after going ashore he
contracted pneumonia, and for three weeks
was so ill that no one but the nurse and his
wife —who had followed him a week later
and intended to proceed to England as a Red
Cross worker—were permitted to see him.
When last heard of he was hoping to be in-
valided to the Cold Country.
The winter ice rink is about to be laid
down at the Glaciarium, and on Thursday
next week the building that stands on the
left-hand, of West’s will be the Glassy Harem
once again. Tickets are out for the opening-
skate.
Harry Plimmer and Winter Hall, having
finished the North Island portion of their
dramatic tour of Maoriland, have handed
over a cheque for £l5OO, being the profits up
to date available for the Belgian Fund. And
it seems only a week ago that we saw them
off on the expedition. Governor Liverpool
and Premier Massey sent along special votes
of thanks to the managers.
Are any of our girls, who have failed so
far to capture husbands, going to get a
chance to be married? The outlook looks
blue if not black. Not only are the best of
our young men going away in shoals, but
they are staying away. A most pernicious
arrangement, from the standpoint of the
local matrimonial market, is that one under
•which our wounded are sent to be nursed in
England. Nine hundred of them are already
in hospitals in and around London, anil
more are going, If there is one place more
than another where a girl has a chance it
is a hospital. The man i's at her mercy. He
cannot go out at iiights and be fascinated
by the chorus. He is sufficiently bored to
be in raptures when she talks to him. The
ministering-angel business is, and always
has been, a sure card. The uniform is
attractive. And all these advantages are laid
at the feet, not of our yearning maidens, but
of those on the other side of the earth.
The Defence Department is to blame. I
wonder if the League of Hopeless Spinsters
could do any good by deputationing Senator
Pearce, or having a question asked in the
House by Mr. Anstey? >
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.
‘Fez”: The “Turks” allegedly employed
m the Censor’s office will probably turn out
®y. r * ans called in to aid a harassed
official untangle the Arabic screeds that fall
into his hands. Syrians in Australia have
been busily protesting their loyalty ever
since the war started. They point out that
in the vast majority of cases they come from
the Mount Lebanon district, which only
owes shadowy allegiance to Turkey, and has
not to contribute to the Ottoman army. The
reason is that in. 1860 the gentle inhabitants
of the district fought themselves to a stand-
still, and while they waited for breath an
agitated Porte appealed to the “Five Great
Powers” to take the troublesome district off
his hands. Great Britain, Russia, France,
Germany and Italy thus started to admin-
ister the province. The Syrians consequently
protest their loyalty. But they omit to
mention that some time ago they joyously
formed. Young Turk societies, and cabled an
invitation to a nephew of the late un-
lamented Khedive of Egypt to visit them
m. Australia and listen to their words of
affection. Also they sent large sums of cash
to the Young .Turk party, and when a
Syrian parts with cash there is something
serious the matter.

WHEN “OUT OF SORTS" TAKE
“CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
If fretful, verish, constipated, bilious
or tongue coated, take this delicious
“fruit laxative” at once.
The vague, general discomfort of being
“out of sorts,” when the stomach turns
against food, the eye is dull and the tongue
coated and heavy, can be banished in a few
hours by a dose of “California Syrup of

Lddyson : “There’s nothin’ new, ’n’ if

“Ibis”: A well-grown maize crop on the
alluvial flats of the Manning or Macleay River
(N.S.W.) will easily average 15ft. in height, while
individual plants sown in depressions in the field will
go a couple of feet more. But I never heard of a
crop like “Boronia’s” (B. 29/4/’l5) that went 19ft.
6in. Anyhow, it’s not the length of the stalks which
counts, but the length of the cobs ; and the best I’ve
seen—los bushels to the acre—were gathered off
12ft. stalks. The quality of corn, like that of the
human brain, does not depend on the length of the
stick or skeleton supporting it.

L.A.’ : So “two German prisoners of
war have escaped into the hinterland, and are making
fheii way to Dutch New Guinea, via Lakekamu
(Papua),” are they? Poor devils! That’s where
the Ku-Ku Ku-Kus walk about, and the Ku-Ku
Ku-Ku is so partial to man-meat that if any even
of his relations die from an accident, they bury him
or hei in Tittle Mary instead of the cemetery.
They’ve eaten the country quite empty of other
natives for .hundreds of square miles. So don’t
woi i v that those two German gentlemen may cause
trouble. If tfley do, it will probably only be of a
digestive character.
“Angler”: “Yarrum Yarrum” (B.
1/4/’ 15) displays a profound ignorance of the fish
known in W.A. as a cobbler. The species of gurnet
described by him is called locally the “angel fish.”
The cobbler somewhat resembles a flathead. There
are four feelers on the top lip, and the body is
covered with dark brown skin mottled with grey.
The fish is fitted with three stings, one in the dorsal
fin where the head joins the body, and one in the
gill fin on each side. These stings are of hard, white
bone, about as thick as a match, have very
small barbs along one edge, and are very poisonous.
If stung the remedy is a bee-line for the nearest
supply of turps, kerosene or Condy’s crystals, the
same to be well rubbed in. If this is neglected there
is big danger of blood-poisoning. The cobbler’s
food consists of prawns, which causes it to haunt
shallow water. Ail W.A. harbors and rivers abound
with them, and I have caught specimens up to two
feet six inches long in the Swan River.
A LOVERS TIFF.
“ Wots the trouble between Bill and Liz?"
“ Well, yer see , Bill he got 'aviu words wiv [?] lait, an started beltin 'er; an Liz
she come erlong an seen 'im, an' o' course it made 'er jealous."
"Zainia”: Although dogs will eat a raw
wallaby, it is seldom that they will dine off an
uncooked ’possum or a native bear. ’Possums, bears
and the animals that feed on eucalyptus leaves have
to be boiled, so as to extract the taste from the
flesh, before a dog will say grace over them. Fido’s
favorite dish is the bandicoot. I’ve seen only one
dog in my life that would devour snakes. The
native cat, either cooked or uncooked, is the only
animal that I have known dogs refuse to eat. I
don’t care for it myself.
“Damper Bill” : The Boers are solid evi-
dence against “Cambridge’s” s-tatement (B.
22/3/T5) that there is no cure for hot. They mix
brown sugar with Kaffir beer-dregs and allow it to
ferment in the sun. After a day’s starvation this is
given to the horse. The grub loosens his hold on
the stomach lining, to feed, and the curse of alcohol
does the rest. There’s a moral here somewhere for
anti-alcohol cranks. Vets, have long prescribed
brewers’ grains for bots, but they add a colored
powder, which I am not on speaking terms with.
Ninety per cent, of horses in the country in the late
autumn are afflicted with bots.

“T.F.”: I nominate the wild holly as a
coming scourge ■in northern N.S.W. It grows
between sft. and 6ft. high, is about the same in
circumference, and is covered thickly with oblong
leaves ranging to l}in. x lin. It is good for neither
man nor beast, unsightly to look upon, and search-
ing in its intentions. It is apparently a cross
between the English (Ilex aquifolium) and Yankee
(Ilex opaea ) species. Recently I travelled through
scrub which had been devastated by fire, and while
all other undergrowth had departed in smoke, the
holly was intact. It is a greater pest than the
Scotch thistle or the burr, and the day it gets a
hold on sheep country the pastoralist will be heard
in a new howl. As with the starling, sparrow and
other pests, its presence is a monument to some
bright intelligence which deserves a locker in the
museum.
Condamine”: Is another Australian
native coming into its proper claims for recogni-
tion? A Brisbane furrier made me an offer last
week for a consignment of emu skins, explaining
that he required them chiefly for the feathers.
Only the ostrich can produce a plume of feathers
superior to the emu, and somebody seems to have
awakened to the fact. I reckon that in 19—-
emus will be amongst the great natural resources
that the politicians nail the p.n’s. to.
“Lig Gouger”: I’ve met the original co-
lespondent in all colors, but he turned a new
fashion on to me the other day. He paraded like
any ordinary brown snake, but he wore across his
head a bright red band about three-eighths of an inch
wide. The Oldest Inhabitant of North Queensland
can’t give it a name, so I’m at a deadlock.
“Ibis”: The best way to catch a dingo is
to drop upon him out of a balloon. Failing that
method of surprise take an empty sardine or meat
tin. Mix strychnine with the grease at the bottom
of the tin, close down the lid tight, and sling the
utensil into the bush. Dingo will spend half an
hour getting the tin open, and he’ll rake out the
grease With his paw with fatal results. But throw
out a baited open tin or scrap of meat and Hen-
Dingo won’t touch it with the tip of his tail. Crows
are as canny. We used to stick a baited liver on
the top of the- gallows after killing, but I never saw
a crow toftch it. Yet any meat we left lying around
for the fowls the crows would swallow without wait-
ing for tlie salt to be passed.
ILLUMINATION.
“My medical johnny says, y’ know, that if [?]
went to the war it would give me a sport-
ing chance of losing my bad habits, y' know.
What's the [?] ass mean—eh?"
“Well, I should say he had an idea that rou
might be [?]
: Lucerne should be cut and let
lie for 24 hours before being passed out to Strawberry.
This gets rid of the gaseous properties, and avoids all
danger of blowing V the beast in the manner com-
plained of by “Yanc-y” (B. 29/4/’l5). It also pre-
vents the “lucerne taste” which permeates the juice
of cows fed on freshly-cut supplies.

THE WHITE REEF ON THE HILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I'here’s something in that reef somewheres,” the
old hands used to say;
they said it thirty years ago: they're saving it
to-day!
bhe only wants some capital, a thousand quid
or so,
lo make ’er worth the while, an’ more, of any
minin’ co.
The chaps wot worked ’er missed the gold, as
noo-chums alwiz will;
Hut she will yield a fortune yet—the White Reef
on the Hill.”
AVe fenced and shore, and when we laid a pound or
two to spare
"'e went upon the AA'hite Reef Hill, and bravely spent
it there.
AVe sank and crosscut, and we drove—and she was
hard as steel —
Until oux* pants were mostly rags, and we were
down at heel.
And still we lingered on and on—until the grocer’s
bill
Seemed quite as big as that old reef a-shining on the
hill!
AA r e spent our Sundays loaming on the falls on either
side;
for still she lured us on and on, and would not be
denied.
AVe sent unnumbered assays down from every likely
place,
And still the old return came back: “Gold nil”; or,
p’raps, “a trace.”
We burnt the stone and dollied it, the bar was sel-
dom still;
But never patch we found within the AVhite Reef
on the Hill.
They tell how down the gully's bed, beneath the
northern spur,
AVas found a patch of specimens that “must lia’ come
from ’er.”
They tell how on the brown hillside some chap,
unnamed, unknown,
Discovered, on some doubtful date, a piece of ten-
ounce stone.
It set the tongues a-wag again, it made the pick
and drill
Once more perform heroics on the White Reef on
the Hill!
They tell the rover wondrous yarns, until he sheds
his swag,
And dips with cruel-blistered hands in Fortune's
lucky-bag.
It seems a cert, to draw a prize (ah, plausible the
tales
They tell of wild-cat mining shows from Perth to
Noo South \A r ales!).
The rover dips; but never yet has Fortune deigned
to fill
The hand of him who stayed to test the White Reef
on the Hill.
“There’s something in that reef somewheres, an’
she is bound to pay,”
They said it thirty years ago : they’re saying it
to-day.
But should you get the golden itch, you just take
my advice,
And dodge—for if she gets you there# she’ll hold,,
you like a vyce!
lor she is like a luring girl who chloroforms your
will-
Do anything, but leave alone the White Reef on the
Hill !

A HAPPY, BALD-HEADED
MAN.
Well-Known Politician Nearly Bald Now
Has New Growth of Hair.
Tells How He Did It.
A certain politician, well known on
account of Iris baldness and ready wit, sur-
prised his friends by annealing with a new
growth of hair. Many of his old friends
did not know him, and others thought he
had a wig. <>n being asked how he did it,
he made the following statement: “I attri-
bute the remarkable growth of my hair to
the use of the following simple recipe, which
any lady or gentleman can mix at home: To
a half-pint of water add loz. of bay rum.
a small box of Orlex Compound and loz. of
glycerine. Apply to the scalp two or three
times a week with the finger tips. It not
only promotes the growth of the hair, but
removes dandruff, scalp humors, and pre-
vents the hair from falling out. It darkens
streaked, faded, grey hair, and makes the
hair soft and glossy. These ingredients
can be purchased at any chemist’s at very
little cost, and mixed at home.* f'l

"Tiaki : Xgatoka. the Maori, was a
warrior who fell captive to the enemy. lie knew
lhat already his name appeared on the menu, so he
made a poroporoaki. or valedictory speech, lie was
a chief and would like a hongi (greeting) with a
chief before being partaken of. As the Kaiser of
•he tribe stooped down to press his nose Toka's arm
suddenly encircled liis neck, while he vigorously
inserted a tete, or bone dagger, in the throat of his
enemy, pistolling it up and down till his own body
looked like Hill Xo. 00 with the gore of Ihe foe. lie
left, this life an hour or two earlier on account of
ihis act; but all through the centuries Xgatoka's name
has been chanted in I lie great houses with rever-
ence and respect, whereas if the blood of his enemy
had not made his body tapu, his name would have
been sung to ragtime, and mock of his prowess would
have been made on flutes carved from his own thigh
bones, while his uH hung their heads for very shame.
“Dico”: I haven’t used as fuel the slink-
ing gidya lauded by “Lou” (B. 6/5/’l5), but if it
caii boat the common mallee-root (white variety)
it 11 outclass anything excepting the special kindling
Hie Devil keeps for Germans, hi an ordinary fire-
place two or three malice roots of moderate size will
site, all day long, a clear, almost smokeless fire
like coke; and when they are burnt-out all that
remains is a handful of clean white ash. Another
good point is easy ignition. You need no kindling-
wood. Just pop on a fair-sized root before bed-time,
and its live coals will start a fresh one in the morn-
ing. It makes a safe fire, too, burning slowly and
evenly, and without sparking. Yet, owing to the
heavy rail-freight thousands of tons of this fine fuel
arc stacked-up in the paddocks every year in the
north of Victoria and burnt. Mr. Malice Cocky may
live to see his firewood brought, at great expense,
from Bendigo or Ballarat.
A HAPPY RELEASE FOR
FLANNIGAN.
“I hot was a churchly thrice av Casey's—shootin’
Sharrgeant Flannigan, an' him , poor
fellow , a marri’d Kahn. ’n’ foorteen
children."
“Share, an' its more sorry fer Casey oi am,
fer he'd no throubles at all."
Alainou : Here s a dazzling Northern
Territory recipe for damper. To every pound of
(lour add a large teaspoonful of baking powder, and
salt to taste. Mix to a stiff dough with water, pour
into a greased tin, and bake. The dough should be
just soft enough to pour, and the less handling it
gets the better. Personally, I mix my dampers with
a fork, and never touch them with the hand till
cooked. After sampling every kind of stove and
lange imaginable, I give the palm to the camp-oven.
HIS HIGH INSTEP.
FIRST REJECTED: “They wouldn't have me on account of bad teeth. An army marches on
its stomach , you know."
SECOND REJECTED: “In that case they needn't have rejected me for flat feet."
“Wemmee”: The station-hand looks for
Sunday all the week, and, when it' comes it is oiten
his busy day. He shaves (and gets his hair cut
when necessary), half-soles his old boots, washes and
patches his clothes, cleans his room out, and re-
pairs his furniture. When mustering-, the stockman
knows no break in the round of toil, so there is an
accumulation of little jobs which he can do only
when off duty. The drover gets a “free” afternoon
about once a fortnight or so, when the cattle are
tailed in some well-grassed bend ; and then his time
is fully occupied in washing and cleaning up. You
see wearing apparel spread out all over the place,
and here and there a man laboriously shaving with
a hand-mirror pinned to a tree. Another takes the
opportunity to stuff his saddle, for which purpose he
first pulls the tails of two or three horses. Drovers
seldom use whips, but the stockman finds much recre-
ation in plaiting them, also in carving whip-handles
and pipes. liis holiday is often devoted wholly to
the search for a horse, or else he rides 20 or 30 miles
to have a look at one. The digger and prospector
repair tools and appliances when not “working.”
When no other pastime presses they take a walk over
new ground, in the course of which they have some
exhilarating scrambles into deep gullies and up
precipitous banks ; and after sampling- many “likely-
looking places,” each returns with a prospect tied up
in his handkerchief and another in his hat. If
these show a color when washed and panned off
these men feel quite rested and happy after their
holiday. The dairyman is continuously on the chain.
Sunday is the same as week days, with the exception
of a short spell between milking-s. As his industry
belongs to more settled centres, holidays for races,
shows, and other local events happen occasionally;
but he has to partly manufacture them. He gets up
hours : earlier than usual, to begin with, and the
bustle he puts on almost sets fire to him. Then he
starts- the evening teat-drill much later than usual,
finishing up long- after dark. Thus he expands the
interim between milkings. There’s no doubt he
earns his holiday ; it’s equally certain he stuffs more
hard work into it than any other day in the year.
Still he is satisfied; he is refreshed; his beaming
face shows, when he sits down to his late tea, that
he has enjoyed himself immensely. But he is not
done yet. As likely as not there will be a dance in
the neighborhood ; equally likely he has promised to
take somebody's sister to it. He rides some miles to
her place, thence more miles across country to the
dance. Next morning, when his eyelids want prop-
ping up and he can scarcely drag his legs across the
yard after Strawberry, he tells you in a weary,
husky voice what a orlright time he had.
Ooda”: This is how old Cooramiwdikee
put it to me: “Jindu tsit down, beeg pfella tumble-
down, you nothing tsulky pfella me tsit down
longa wheelbarrow-mia ?” Which was his Cousin Jack
way of asking, if I objected to them camping in the
eartshed, as it was going to rain like the devil after
sundown.

"Jimrao” : I took on some survey work last
week in the St. A maud district, 150 miles from
Melbourne. Looking up the map I found that Tun-
stals would be the town . nearest to the job, and
Bealiba the nearest railway sta-
tion. 1 left the train at the
latter place, and inquired the way
to Tunstals. An old chap in-
formed me “just two miles, and
a straight road.” I walked for
two hours and then roamed into
the bush, but could not sight the
town, so I decided to return to
Bealiba. It was then I learned
that nobody had lived in Tunstals
for the last 30 years; it was. an
old broken-up mining camp. And
yet alleged up-to-date maps show
it as a town. Next day I was
taken to the spot, and, sure
enough, a village had been there.
It was not a calico town either,
but had been made of mud, brick,
wattle-and-daub and timber. The
formation of the streets was still
visible, but trees had sprung up
all over them. The rusted frame
of an old lamp hanging to a post
was the relic of one of the two doctors who hung
out their stand-off lights. There are dozens of other
deserted mining camps in Australia, but I. doubt
if there's another quite so utterly flattened out.
* * * *
“Tamumu”: Touching the matter of the
sea-serpent recently seen off Kawhia (M.L.), 1 once
saw the monster in the Indian Ocean north of the
Seychelles. Others saw it, too. It was only about
a quarter of a mile away at the time. Judging
from the coils above the surface, the beast or fish
or reptile was about 200 ft. long. ■ When the tele-
scope was turned on the snake it disappeared.
Instead, what we saw was a huge shoal of porpoises
Playing follow-my-leader, 20 or 30 of them being
in the air at once, forming a segment of a cirtle
above the water, and suggesting the coils of some
huge marine reptile. Possibly a good many other
serpents may be explained the same way. Those that
can’t are probably produced with the aid of a
corkscrew.
"The Reefer”: “X.P.D.” recently im-
parted some inexact information re the Motuan
potters (Port Moresby, Papua). There isn't any
glazed pottery made anywhere in Polynesia. The red
mangrove extract is simply mixed as coloring with
tin* clay. The various marks on the earthenware
are "trade” or makers’ marks, and haven’t any totem-
istic significance. No lakatoi (trading vessel) has
ever gone further than the Purari delta to trade its
cargo of earthenware, etc., for sago. That enter-
prise originated in this way. Back in hazy ages
an ugly man named Edai Siabo was seized from a
canoe near the atoll of Bava, and taken to a mag-
nificent submarine cavern. Here he was instructed
how to construct the big, sea-going lakatoi, and told
to load her principally with the pottery, for which,
even then, the Motuans were famous, and to sail
far to the westward, past the many hostile peoples,
until he came to a people who had a wonderful food.
B hen Edai reached the surface he had been trans-
figured to an Adonis. He induced a party to assist
him to carry out the god’s instructions, and, whilst
the men busied themselves making the huge dug-outs,
the females made all sorts of earthenware utensils.
Ultimately the laliatois were completed, laden with
this pottery, and, after great festivities, the little
hoet of adventurers sailed away. During their ab-
sence, various restrictions were placed on their female
relatives. They must not bathe, nor eat of certain
fish, nor talk at certain places or at specified times,
under penalties unknown, but very dreadful. But
as moon after moon came and went, without any
news coming about the expedition, the women gradu-
ally gave up hope of seeing their men again, and
all except Edai’s missus remanded. That faithful lady
never stirred from the little hut which had been
specially built for her, and where it was her duty
to keep a fire burning always, until the expedition
returned'. At length she received word that some
peculiar craft were coming. She replenished her
fire and then set out in her small canoe. Ere
she got far the whole fleet of triumphant lakatoi x,
with gay pennons of success fluttering far out in
the breeze, swung in a body round the headland and
fairly leaped toward the village with the whistling
nor -wester. Edai’s vessel, slightly in advance, tore
alongside the tiny canoe on which was his faithful
wife, and she was snatched aboard. When these
gioat vessels arrived with their immense cargoes of
delicious sago, their crews’ former women flung 1 them-
selves at tlie sailors’ feet, craving forgiveness. But
they were up against it, for all the budding maidens
in the neighboring villages lavished their charms on
the heroes. Ever since then, the lahatois liav.: made
this annual trading voyage, and bring hundreds of
tons of green sago to Ela in return for many thou-
sands of pots.
‘’West Coaster”: Tlie west coast (S.
Aus.) binghi has the habit of looking for breakfast,
with the aid of a firestick and pronged fish-spear,
wading in shallow water. Occasionally a cobbler
torpedoes him. When that happens he bolts for the
shore, kindles a fire, and holds the injured member
as close to it as he comfortably can. For two solid
hours he does not shift. The agony caused by tlie
sting of this marine devil must be excruciating, for
I have seen Binghi roll and roar with pain, while
perspiration ran off him in streams, before he could
get his fire hot enougft for relief. The cobbler
would seem to be common in different parts of the
world. I have heard old North Sea fishermen de-
scribe him and his devilishness in their experience of
emptying the trawl nets. Their antidote was to
rub the stung part good and hard with oil or grease,
or to apply rum outwardly and inwardly.
ON THE WAY HOME TO DINNER:
AN APPETISER.
Owing to the high price of meat a vigorous cam-
paign has been commenced by the Vegetarian Society
through street signs and literature. —News item.
Ikikki : Iu the New Hebrides cjuiiiine
in white balls is placed in a glass bowl on the table,
just as if it were lump sugar, and after dinner the
dish is passed round and you take one if you’re so
inclined. The French settlers, however, are begin-
ning to prefer hypodermic injections of quinine.
They find that an injection of quinine will keep them
free of fever for three months, whereas some of ’em
used to have to take pills every day.
THE LONG. LONG BEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The corner held a dreary man
Who little did but sip and munch.
He sat behind a pewter can—
Supplied two hours ago by Dan—
In touch with Kelly's counter-lunch.
W itli nought to do, and naught to say,
lie wiled the live long night away.
1 was after ten, and Kelly's cheek
Uas burning red with righteous rage.
A dozen times he turned to speak,
As oft the stranger’s eye so meek
The barman’s anger did assuage.
In infantile beatitude
He sat and sipped, and chewed, and chewed.
The pub was shut. "J'was twelve, I think,
And in a dim, religious light
Ihe beat remained to nod and blink
Behind his solitary drink.
Then Kelly flung him to (lie night—
“Gor’struth, that’s coinin' it too strong.
’I on make a woodser eight hours long-!"

“Murrihils” : I didn’t want anything from
the hawker, but to save argument I bought a
sixpenny packet of “camphor powder.” Some
time later when I opened the packet, I was
delighted to find that the camphor powder
was joz. of flour. Yet I hear people com-
plaining that there’s no money in wheat-
growing in these days of Govt.-fixed prices!

“Ifan”: Butter at Is. 4d. is too dear. The
N.S.W. North Coast cowmen have had
the best season on rec-oild, too. Yet they
are stirring Cain to get more. When the
margarine threatened their monthly
cheques a year or two ago a considerate
people agreed to the prohibition of coloring
matter, the use of which helned to sell an
article of food said to be as nutritious
as butter. But with the change in com-
plexion would it not be a good idea .to abro-
gate that regulation and allow margarine
to be manufactured and sold under State
supervision ? If the article can be sold in
Great Britain at sixpence a pound by com-
panies making up to 200 per cent, profit
annually, it could b*e put on this market at a
price which would make Is. 4d. for butter
look silly. A chan/ie for Holman !

“Copabella”: In town if a man wants to
suicide or a lady wiants .to throw a little vit-
riol on the other cat, both experience a cer-
tain amount of difficulty in getting the where-
withal. In the country, however, no such
annoying iharassmenits occur.; strychnine is
a matter of penn’orths, spirits of salts are
ladled ouft into any old jug, bluestone (sul-
phate oficopper) is an ordinary item in the
grocery parcel, and carbolic-acid and cyanide
mere cirqwmstances of the daily round* The
other dap a child faced the man behind the
store cm/nter with a request for “two bobs’
worth ofi vit’rul”! “Good lord!” said he.
“What for?” “Mum wants it for the clo-
thes.” "“Never heard of vitriol for clothes,”
the storekeeper murmured to me as he filled
a beer-bottle with crude sulphuric acid. He
peneilleil “acid” on a piece of stamp edging
and flapped it across the beer label. “Tell
mum !o be careful; it’s poison,” he- re-
markejd casually as he handed over the bomb
to the infanf;. A few minutes later the infant
returned. “Mum don’t want this yeller
stuff," she raid. “Mum wants like what they
puts In the fmotor-bikes !” “Mum” had meant
petrol: but one wonders what will happen
some day .when mum doesn’t notice the
“yellerness”' of a purchase, or sends for
arsenic whpn she means cream of tartar.
“Mary McC.”: I want to know, and 111
bet twopence nobody will tell me, why win-
dow blinds are not made part and parcel of
rented houses. Windows are of all sizes and
shapes, and, barring unusual luck, the blinds
suitable for one bouse never lit another. This
means expense to those moving from man-
sion to mansion and is utterly without sense.
If window blinds are not fixtures, why
should doors be or window sashes or mantel-
pieces or anything else? In fact, why should
the roof be a fixture? Each tenant might
bring along his own, and nail it on while the
furniture was being brought in. In Hades
landlords will be condemned to put up blinds
to all eternity, if the prayers of thousands of
their earthly victims are answered.

“Frank O.”: “Stockman’s” (B. 15/4/’l5)
outlook on life will not be darkened by plums
or plum jam for many moons. Owing to the
failure of the plum crop the preserved article
has become almost as scarce as _ eel’s feet.
The present bete noire (or should it be rouge
noire?) of those who buy jam by the case is
raspberry. I know because I have to try to
sell it, and there is an accumulation on the
shelves sufficient to fill a War Office order.

“E.S.S.” : This is the story of my friend
the orchardist. Launching a hundred cases
of choice peaches on the market he trucked
them to the consumer, just to learn where
each party stood. Peaches sold in the “open”
market at 2s. 6d. per case, or £l2 10s. for the
lot. Out of that the agent took £3 15s. Fol-
lowing them to the shop, he found they were
being retailed at 3d. each. As each case con-
tained five dozen, this second batch of middle-
men would handle about £75 for the consign-
ment. The so-called open market is really
manipulated by a ring composed principally
of foreigners. Among themselves they fix the
price of different grades of fruit to be auc-
tioned, and practically divide the spoil.
There is very little outside competition, cer-
tainly not enough to effect the price agreed
upon by the ring. That is Avhy the most pro-
lific seasons make no difference to the con-
sumer. If he thinks he is going to get cheap
fruit whop he hears of a phenomenal har-
vest, he' provokes the mirth of the retailer.
The Sydney municipal authorities, instead
of caring for the public, play into the hands
of the monopolists by harassing the cheap
fruit-vendor whenever he appears in the
street with his barrow. They make the ex-
cuse that the street vendor pays no rent, and
that the shopkeepers who pay heavy rent
must be protected; but that is merely an at-
tempt to condone extortion by landlords.

A committee of the House of Commons
has been investigating the evils of the drug
“quack” and lias been clamoring for an axe.
Arriving at the decision that the Britishers
are increasingly doping themselves with
“patent” medicines, the committee has re-
commended that the advertisement and sale
of alleged cures for cancer, consumption,
lupus, deafness, diabetes, fit?, paralysis
epilepsy, locomotor ataxia, Bright-**,
and rupture (“without operation and appli-
ances”) should be prohibited. Much of the
trash sold as “cures” for these and other
diseases may not be harmful in themselves,
but the sufferer who browses on them delays
so long in obtaining skilled attention (when
it is obtained at all) that the chance of
recovery is lessened. The enormous amount
of money rooked from the long-eared public
is another matter that requires considera-
tion ; and some of the consideration could
be profitably done in Australia.

“Blackbutt”: “Ruru” (B. 13/5/’l5)
shows woeful ignorance of timber measuring
when comparing prices of imported Oregon
and Australian hardwood. At 10s. per 100
lineal, 3 x 2 is 20s. per 100 super., or 2s.
dearer than Oregon at 18s. per 100 super.
“Ruru” says it is “more than twice the
price.” The hardwood sawmillers’ appeal
to architects will avail nothing until a stiff
duty of at least 10s. per 100 suner. is levied
on Oregon, for no timber merchant will
push hardwood whilst big profits accrue in
sawing up Oregon into scantling sizes.
Prahran Independent Church recently ad-
vertised for a married couple to care-take the
tabernacle and give their whole time to it.
The cash remuneration offered was £52 per

stand for too much independence in the holy
retainer who scrubs out.
THE MAN THAT EATS CEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The crushers thunder overhead, and like a hungry
beast »■:
Their jaws of steel the granite crunch, for that’s
their daily feast. • f
They keep the feeders shov'ling hard each time the
cable tips,
For twice a hundred tons a day go through their
iron lips.
Below, the mixers rumble round, so many turns to
go—
So many turns and not one more—they must not
wait below.
And here upon the gauging floor it’s pretty constant,
too—
The metal rattles down the chute, the sand comes
pouring through.
It’s Number Three (cement, three bags, and Number
Two goes four,
For Number One it’s five to go), and mind you put
no more!
For here we’re in the presence of—we work beneath
his eye—
Inspector James McGinnis, and he takes some getting
by!
But we’ve another name for him. With no unkind
intent,
Amongst ourselves we know him as the Man That
Eats Cement!
Now, when the hot nor’-westers blow, Lord, but the
dust is bad !
The grit, the sand, the fine cement —-’twould drive a
dead man mad !
And when. the days are hot and still, no breath of
air astir,
The dust hangs in a stifling cloud and tastes like
mouldy fur,
But through it all, at Duty’s post, Inspector Jim is
there,
To tally up, and see that we are gauging all with
care. .j.
Says he: “Me boys, when I was schooled, this logic
I was learned —•
To do me best however small might be the job
concerned. ■*,
Me part in this I mean to do, so I will have no fears
But that this blessed wall will last ten times a
thousand years ! ” pr
And like a captain on the bridge, or guard before
his tent,
’Mid dust he paceS to and fro, the Man That Eats
Cement.
On days there are no places cleared, no spaces we can
fill,
When silent are the crushers, and the mixers too, are
still; ’ ...
He wanders round like one that’s lost, for slowly goes
the time
Without the gauge-truck’s rattle, and the floating
cloud of grime.
“Give us this day our daily bread”—but Jimmy
prays, they say, „
“Give me each day my daily dust, or I shall pine
away!” v
And when he reaches Heaven—as, of course, he‘s
bound to do—
When jasper walls and streets of gold burst on his
eager view, -4
He’ll want to straightway tell the Lord the glitter's
all in vain—
It wouldn’t keep Hell’s legions out if they should
come again!
He’ll want the Heav’nly engineers from their old
ways divorced;
The worth he’ll have them understand of concrete,
re-inforced.
And if they let him gauge the stuff, when Hell’s
assault is spent,
Its baffled Chief will curse for aye the Man That
Eats Cement!

SONGS WITHOUT TEETH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“How can I write?” the poet wailed,
“I have not any teeth!”
Before his gaze the dentist quailed
And laid a white half-wreath
Of molars on the glassy tray
Whereon the tools of torture lay.
“How can you write without your teeth ?
You don’t need teeth to write!
I knew,” the dentist said, “one Heath—
A poet, toothless quite,
Yet he could song’s and sonnets make,
Though quite unable to eat steak!”
“I cannot write,” the poet yelled,
“Unless my teeth are in !”
His chest with indignation swelled ;
He made an awful din.
The dentist, very calm and white,
Said “Nonsense! Who needs teeth to write ?”
“I. do not write!” the poet howled.
“I sing my songs to life!”
Hyaena-like he champed and prowled.
The dentist found a knife
And worked off some superfluous hate
By scraping at a broken plate.
“I cannot sing! ” the poet stormed.
“I can t pronounce the words!”
And instantly he was informed:
“You listen to the birds!
Go out, old man, and stand beneath
A tree! They sing without their teeth!”
The poet straightway drew a gun
And shot the dentist dead.
He left a little bill, the Hun,
Beside the corpse’s head.
It read —this worst of callous tricks:
“To one lead filling, ten-and-six! ”

Merits your confidence, not merely because it is the product of your com-
patriots and affords constant and well-remunerated employment to over
500 of your fellow Australians, but because it offers to you many distinct
advantages which are unobtainable in any imported player-piano.
THE BEALE PLAYER-PIANO is constructed on quite unique principles, to designs born of
over thirty years’ practical experience of Australian musical requirements, Australian climatic
conditions, and a keen appreciation of the fundamental limitations of the ordinary player-piano.
THE BEALE PLAYER-PIANO is the first perfect player-piano with the true human touch
and expression—that indefinable something which unmistakably distinguishes the unsym-
pathetic, soulless brilliance of the ordinary mechanical player-piano from the hand of the
artist. Its extraordinary controllability, simplicity, sensitiveness and delicacy of operation
compel the full expression of the personality and musical taste of the operator.
Judged by any standard —for its musical quality—for its durability—for its efficiency—for
its .originality—the Beale Player-Piano by its successful demonstration more than fulfills
our every claim.
Its tone is pure, rich and extremely beautiful. Its case plain in design yet dignified & handsome

“Pat McTaffy”: If those Patagonian
Taffies who have' come to the Commonwealth
multiply as quickly in the Northern Terri-
ior.v as they have done in S. America, then
there will soon he no more talk of a vacant
North. Taffy in S. America still clings
to his religious sentiments and his
native lingo, ’but transplanting has made
a linguist of him. Most of him can
speak Spanish and Italian. The 153
Welsh families that landed in the Argentine
in 1856 constituted the first European settle-
ment in Patagonia. Lured there by two
smooth-tongued countrymen, they found when
they landed not even a hut in which to shel-
ter, and were without even a rifle to defend
themselves. They were only saved from
actual starvation by the Indians. On two
occasions the British Government sent out
a shipload of supplies, but otherwise for 20
years the wanderers were forgotten. Some
are now very wealthy. The Vic. Govern-
ment spent a good deal of money once in
endeavoring to get them to settle in Vic-
loria. Taffy Rees, M.L.A., was sent to
cajole them in their own tongue, but failed
to" convince them that Vic. was overflowing
with milk and money. Up to recent time, at
any rate, no more than one or two families

“W.A.R.”: It is little to say that Bean’s
first report of the fighting in Gallipoli
proved disappointing to Australians already
keyed up by Ashmead Bartlett’s open and
generous amazement at the brilliant Aus-
tralian feat of arms. But this is to be
said for Bean. He was an Australian writ-
ing of Australians; he knew exactly what
Australians could do; and what to the
British correspondent seemed marvellous was
to Bean merely all in an Australian’s day’s
work. Knowing the capacity of Australian
troops, he took as a matter-of-course their
bravery, their daring, their recklessness,
their endurance. Tlie English correspon-
dent had no such knowledge. Hence the
difference in their reports. But why Bean’s
was so belated is a matter for inquiry. It
is at least only fair to Bean’s reputation
as a war-correspondent that an official state-
ment should be made as to whether the blame
for the delay was due to Bean or to the
authorities.

it indicates that Islam is still a

® tten , iat , . ke ?? ems fancy he can
always make himself a nuisance and get out

nelles are forced the Turk is absolutely at
the mercy of the Allies, and there is no
earthly reason why the Ottoman Empire
should be regarded as having a further Euro-
pean existence at all. All that should be
necessary is to seize Constantinople and
establish a strict Criminal Court to investi-
gate the atrocities and murders of
the last 20 years, after which there wouldn’t
be enough Turks left out of gaol or un-
hanged to make a decent-sized suburban
municipality. To treat with a nation of this
sort is absurd. Let any portion of it that
wants to work trek over into Angora and
breed goats or cats, but don’t let it have a
gun or any edged tools. Even a knife and
fork are quite unnecessary, for it feeds its
face with its hand.
The most depressed German in all Aus-
tralia is probably Pastor Niemeyer, head of
the Apostolic Church in Queensland. Nie-
meyer’s secular hobby, in which successive
Governments encouraged him, consisted in
importing able-bodied Deutschers and set-
tling them on the land, and few men make
their hobbies succeed better. To-day he sees
the end of his labors, and would probably
gladly sing “Nunc Dimittis.”
The war in the Religious Editor’s
suburb: —
The Equity barrister with the strong sense of
duty was on very good terms with the gentle old
Peace Society lady who lived in the next house until
the dark day he joined the local rifle club and
started to be seen about the streets in company with
an obsolete rifle. Then the little friendship snapped
off, and the white-capped Peace-lover lurked amongst
her roses and said bitter things every time the frail,
spectacled patriot trudged past with the heavy kill-
ing implement on his shoulder. “Slayer of his
fellow-men!” was the first aside that stung his ears,
Then, in quick succession, he heard himself stigma-
tised as an “English Prussian” and a “Six-and-
Eightpenny Cain!” But he marched proudly
l )ast and affected not to hear until he got the bomb-
shell: “Pettifogging murderer!” A brisk but in-
conclusive argument followed, and now the indig-
llant lawyer always starts for drill by the backyard
route.
A fine soldier was put out of action when
Major W. W. Alderman was wounded. He
belonged to Australia’s staff corps, but just
before going to help carve Turkey, was on
loan to Maoriland. lie made an enviable
reputation among all ranks of the M.L.
army, and probably could get more out of
the men under his command than any other
officer in the service. At the time of his
mishap he was in command of M.L.’s 10th
infantry regiment.
Maoriland Railway Department is start-
j n g to equip all its . important booking-
offices with a new ticket-dating machine
locally invented. The old machine, im-
ported from distant parts, was a cumbrous
thing requiring two movements. The new
device does everything at one hit. The in-
ventor is W. P. Nolan, of Waitalnma ; and
aSi the slow contrivances are in use in
Australia and Britain he isn’t expected to
remain a mere stationmaster very long.


How to Have a Clear
Complexion.
It is quite easy even in a hot climate like
Australia to prevent the wrinkling, drying
and blotching effect of the dust and heat, but
it is absolutely necessary to use a pure soap
without any added coloring matter or excess
of soda. Puritol Wax Soap is such
a soap, with just a little line per-
fume added, and some Puritol wax,
which has such a reputation for keeping the
skin soft and for removing pimples and
blotches. A very fine film of the wax is left
on the skin after using this soap, which
effectually protects the skin from heat and
dust. Its healing effect is well known on
blotchy skius, and undoubtedly many of th«
fine complexions are due to the use of Puritol
Wax Soap.* £1

STOMACH TROUBLES DUE TO
ACIDITY.
SO SAYS EMINENT SPECIALIST.
So-called stomach troubles, such as indi-
gestion, wind, stomach-ache and inability to
retain food, instead of indicating that" the
stomach is out of order, are in nine cases
out of 10 simply evidence that fermentation
is taking place in the food contents of the
stomach, causing the formation of gas and
acids. Wind distends the stomach, and
causes that full, oppressive feeling some-
times known as heartburn, while the acid
irritates and inflames the delicate lining of
the stomach. The stomach, however, is
not at fault. The trouble lies entirely in
the fermenting food. Such fermentation is
unnatural, and acid formation is not only
unnatural, but may involve the most serious
consequences if not prevented. To prevent
or stop fermentation of the food contents
of the stomach and to neutralise the acid
and render it bland and harmless, half a
teaspoonful of bisurated magnesia, probably
the best and most effective antacid known,
should be taken in a quarter of a glass of
hot or cold water immediately after eating,
or whenever wind or acidity is felt. This
stops the fermentation, and neutralises the
acidity in a few moments. Fermentation,
wind and acidity are dangerous and unne-
cessary. Stop or prevent them by the use
of a proper antacid, such as bisurated mag-
nesia. which can be obtained from any
chemist, and thus enable the stomach to do
Its work properly without being hindered by
gas and dangerous acids. —

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Hang-the-Kaiser”: A lot of would-be
recruits are nursing a grievance. Passed by
country doctors and farewelled by friends,
they leave their jobs in distant townships
to go to the Front. In the capitals they are
blocked by another medical examination,
because their feet have not the requisite
curve or something, and they return home
to face the people who have cheered them
on the track and presented them with
watch-bracelets. Couldn’t military authority
find some way out for these people?
There is a tremendous lot to be done besides
fighting and marching. If battles are really
won in the workshop, why not give the
rejected who are nearly fit a chance to wheel
trucks in a munition factory? Those who
are really keen would rather load shrapnel
on a railway waggon than be out of it alto-
gether.
WATCH THAT FLY.
The Grafton Separation Committee in connection
with the movement for the formation of a new State
in northern N. S. Wales has intimated that the
convention will be held in Armidale during the last
week in May, or early in June. —Obscure nous item.
Australia —a continent of magnificent dis-
tances where the people think in penny sec-
tions.
Through Alexander McDonald resigning
his seat for Alexandra, A. H. Peake, the de-
feated S. Aus. ex-Premier, is now almost
certain to get back to the Assembly, as Alex-
andra is a stronghold of Liberalism. Should
Peake return to Parliament, “Dick" Butler
will surrender the Opposition leadership, to
which he was elected recently. McDonald can
have a seat in the Upner House when a
Liberal vacancy occurs, if he then wants it.
“If China were a military nation she
would never have been thus challenged,”
says the London Daily News, talking of
the demands made by Japan. What an
eye-opener war is! A year ago the Daily
News gibbered at the very mention of
armaments. Now, after nine months of
disillusionment, it subscribes to the view,
which ought to have been obvious all along,
that to leave the door unlocked is to invite
the thief to walk in.
Britain realises the gravity of the posi-
tion better than it did in August, and so
where then it did away with the national
menace of Party Government it now goes
a step further towards the Elective Minis-
try _ principle. The times being badly out
of joint the best men have been- chosen to
govern the country. Family influence,
party service, personal ponularity—none of
these counts for the moment. A lawyer
managed the affairs of the army in the
years immediately before the war, when the
army was regarded more as an ornament
than anything else. Now it is being run
by the greatest soldier-organiser in the
Empire. An ex-cavalry officer controlled the
navy till last week. The question that is now
being asked everywhere about any given
candidate for a place in the Cabinet is not,
“Is he a good Liberal, a faithful party man
and a contributor to the party funds?” but
simply “Does he know his job?” If he does
he is safe ; if he doesn’t he is doomed.
AMERICA'S STILL, STRONG MAN.
The Leg. Council election for a Hobart
seat went as nearly everybody knew it
would. Bond, the retiring member, never
made a speech in his life, did the same thing
in the campaign and jumped in by a positive
majority. A question of interest is how
many more times Bottrill, a local doctor of
laws, will drop his deposit. Gray, the
Laborite, made some rattling speeches, but
they couldn’t pull a vote. Fat reckoned
Gray was too intelligent for the old House of
Dodery, and voted solidly for Bond, and
nobody to speak of except Fat has a vote.
The Sultan has accepted a cross—an iron
one at 12s. Cd. the gross. Once such a gift
to that large person would have been the
most terrific* insult; but the boss of Islam
is meek these days and probably wouldn’t
worry if the Athanasian creed were printed
on his shirt. Anyhow, while German officers
delude the faithful by wearing armlets with
pieces of the Koran printed on them, the
Caliph goes to the mosque wearing as sole
adornment a piece of ironmongery shaped as
the emblem of the infidel.
The Holman Ministry went out fishing
the other day in one of the imported
trawlers and came ashore with the whole
catch concealed in a lunch basket, to ponder
miserably over what was going- to happen
if that was all the foreign-built machines
could dig from the vast Pacific. Since then
the beautiful dream of flounders two-a-penny
has changed into horrid apprehension of
leather jackets costing £lO Gs. Sd. apiece,
and Ministers are talking darkly about the
ruinous demands for an eight hours day
made by the crew, and of being able to get
rid of the trawlers without serious loss.
George Black, who holds the portfolio of
Chief Fisherman, has fiercely remarked
that eight hours for deckhands and firemen
is “ridiculous,” and looks with sour dis-
favor on the three contraptions Holman got
hold of with his hurried p.n. To sell the
trawlers and spend the cash oh painting
police-stations would be living up to the
Holmanesque tradition, anyhow.
The S. M. Herald hits its three-month-
old joss a preliminary whack: —
To those who, being fit and of soldier age, and with-
out dependents, yet hold back and hide behind a rifle
club, letting gailant souls, old. and young, bear the
brunt of their task, it must be said that the future
will call them to judgment.
The young unmarried rifle clubber does not
fear being called to judgment by the future.
All he worries about is that he may be
called to the colors by the Government, and
that is the very thing that the Herald, the
opponent of “conscription,” is helping to pro-
tect him from.
While reading news the other morning of
desperate fighting in Gallipoli, with sugges-
tions of a campaign ahead that will cost a
mountain of money, N. S. Wales was inter-
rupted by a loud wail as of a dirge for the
unreturning brave. It was only Holman
howling in the distance for another loan to
spend on monkey cages and so on. The
Norton Griffiths shindykit had arrived a day
or two before, but the four millions this
concern promises to spend during the next
year doesn’t half fill Holman’s stomach. He
wants five millions more, and when last heard
of was sitting miserably on the Treasury
steps plaintively demanding to know where
and how he was going to get it.
Maoriland is settling down in the saddle
that Von Sossage hurriedly climbed out of
in Samoa. From May the British currency
supplanted the German article, and a branch
of the B.N.Z. hung out its signboard. But
it is still technically an error to refer to
these islands —including German New
Guinea—as the late possessions of William.
Colonel Holmes explained to the court-
martial in Sydney the other day that so far
there had only been “military occupation” ;
formal annexation will come presently.
Rudolf Martin, in “The
World War and Its End,”
throws some light on Ger-
many’s relations with the
“neutrals.” The end of the
war, as Rudolf Martin sees
it, will be a crushing victory
for Germany; after which
she will deal with the Allies’
landed estates and distribute
provinces among her col-
leagues and friends. When
Russia is “literally dismem-
bered,” and Germany, Aus-
tria and Turkey are tearing
their chosen portions from
the poor Bear’s carcase, one
of the neutrals will be fav-
ored with a bit. “Sweden
will be given Finland.” Now,
what is Sweden doing to deserve this kind-
ness from Germany?
Maoriland Supreme Court has outed
another M.P. and disqualified him for 12
months on the ground of “undesirable prac-
tices.” Jennings this time, one of the anti-
Massey brigade. The position now is that
the Government has to win the two by-elec-
tions in order to be independent of Henare
te Innep’ent. If it only wins one. then the
brown enigma will still command the situa-
tion. If lou Ward can snare both, then out
goes Massey.
“FOOTPRINTS ON THE SANDS OF
TIME .”
Since 1909 there has been a steady increase in
the proportion of imported footwear, the advance
being 148.8 per cent.
AT ALDERSHOT.
THE LIEUTENANT: “ Now, boys, I wont you
to be a credit to Australia and show
these English johnnies we can conduct
ourselves as soldiers: and for God's
safe don't call me Alf.”
Mystery surrounds the departure of
manager JV right, of the Lithgow small-arms
factory. lie has resigned, but his connec-
tion with the Commonwealth Government is
not to be terminated, and lie is to come back
to supervise the duplication of the factory
plant in a year or so. Meantime he is going
to control a combination of small-arms fac-
tories “abroad,” which will turn out as many
rifles in a day as can be made in Lithgow in
a month; and he leaves Australia for the
United States. He may go further ; but, on
the other hand, his new job may be in the
United States. Anyway, the appointment of
Wright is gratifying. To send to Australia
for a man to do a big job is a fragrant com-
mentary on Australia’s wicked habit of im-
porting people to do its own big jobs.
THE ROAD AND THE JOURNEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am not objecting if the basis of the Constitution
is altered.- —George lieeby.
Let us begin anew. Our journey here
Was by a wrong and ill-constructed track.
Our numerous mistakes have grown so clear
We must retrace our steps and trundle back,
lte-make the road, and from a fairer start
Whip up the horse that pulls the nation’s cart.
Of course, it may be that our second try
Will be but little better than the first.
There may be ruts, or in the driver’s eye
Dust may be blown ; but even at the worst
We can turn back once more, tear up the road,
Make it again, and try it with our load.
By doing this a dozen times or so
We shall enjoy some gentle exercise.
Our statesmen out of work may 7 get a show
Assisting in the curious enterprise,
While parties now condemned to scorn and cold
May find the cash and comfort of the fold.
Meanwhile, our journey's goal is far away
Beyond remote horizons misty pale.
Already we are late, and each delay
Adds to the fear that we shall fall and fail.
“Better,” says one, “make good the present road,
And lumber forward meantime with our load.”
Away! Such dull suggestions give us pain !
Who speaks of travel till the way is right?
Tear up the track and lay it down again,
Make each blue-metal cube a separate fight.
Mending the ruts is simply idle play—
Tear up the road and go back every, day !

THE SPECIAL CASE OF SUGAR-FAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Justice Edmunds: Have you any objection to the
commission inquiring into the profits made by the
company during the past few months?
Mr. Knox: 1 don’t think that matters.
Justice Edmunds: Pardon me, we have to do our
business in our own way.
Mr. Knox: I think the question quite futile and
totally unnecessary.
-—Report of inquiry re the price of sugar.
The housewife’s brow may wear an extra wrinkle,
Scanning the weekly bill;
The grocer sigh for cash that fails to tinkle
Within his guarded till;
Teaspoons may quite outlast their present uses.
Hut one large fact remains:
The people who extract the sugar juices
Must hide from view their gains.
The baker, thumping dough to feed the nation,
When days grow bleak and stern
Reveals without the slightest perturbation
What his white fist can earn;
The lady, splashing soapsuds for a living,
Unshaken by regrets
Must state her profits at the washtub, giving
Details of all she gets.
These are but common folks, and their devices
Are simple, dull and tame;
But when we are reviewing sugar prices
The case is not the same.
Then we are up against a proposition
Of quite a different kind,
And Fat, who holds the key of the position,
Must keep the public blind.
Generous his soul. He toils with might to sweeten
A nation’s daily food.
That he should be restricted or brow-beaten,
To say the least, were rude.
His.profits merely mark his high devotion.
Avaunt the thick-soled boot
That aims to set his hinder parts in motion,
Uncovering his loot 1
Bong fortified amid his crude molasses,
Or pounded sugarcane,
He sits and dreams he rules a world of asses
Whose words are weak and vain ;
But some cold morning a new understanding
May dawn beneath his hat,
When strong Australia’s voice is heard demanding
The death of Sugar-Fat!

INDIGESTION
CAUSED CONSIDERABLE SUFFER-
ING. WONDERFUL RESULTS FROM
a Course of dr. morse’s Indian
root PILLS.
“After a severe attack of rheumatic fever
I was a martyr to indigestion,” writes Mr.
George Samuel Pamplin, greengrocer, of ?00
Weston Road, Rozelle, N.S.W., “and my
entire system became deranged. Headaches
I had badly, and I would be constipated for
a week at a stretch. After eating, a heavy,
burning lump would settle in my chest; the
pain was distressing, and I had a stuffed-up
sensation as if I were choking. Through
my indigestion I would be so incapacitated
that I would have little or no rest for a
week, and it was utterly impossible to per-
form my duties. After taking Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills I was relieved of all signs
of indigestion; my bowels were soon put into
perfect working order, and they now act as
regularly as they should. I find a decided
improvement in my health. I have tried
many medicines, but have found nothing as
good a corrective as Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. I may also add to this testimonial
(which may be published) that I am a native
of Tasmania, and am very well knowr
throughout Hobart.”*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
Captain 11. H. (“Rusty”) Hunter, killed
at the Dardanelles, was one of the most brilliant
amateur athletes Australia has produced. As a
schoolboy at Melbourne Grammar he easily topped
all as a sprinter and broad-jumper. At Melbourne
\ arsitv he was a star performer, and as a student
cleaned up Victorian and Australasian championships,
besides no end of handicaps, from back marks. His
most memorable race occurred on the M.O.C. Ground,
when he defeated Nigel Barker for the 100yds. cham-
pmnship of Australasia in a run-off after a dead-heat
in the final He played League football in Melbourne,
but invariably proved too fast for the ball, so to
/ttoV. , l ! llri "r his dental course at Pennsylvania
(U.S.A.) he played the ’Murkan Rugbv game, which
provided fine opportunities for his great strength and
pace.._ Rusty could go several good rounds with the
gloves, but was really a better fighter than a boxer,
lie stood on an exceptionally powerful pair of legs,
and in every way was a contradiction of the accepted
build for foot-running.
, ..The earliest love of Anthony Wilding,
killed the other day in France, was cricket; neverthe-
less he was on good enough terms with tennis to win
the championship of Canterbury (M.L.) when he
was 16. He very soon pushed his way into the
Lancaster Park Club’s first-grade cricket 11 along-
ionohf ' a< - FZ en when he went to Cambridge, in
1902, he was st lV a staunch cricketer, and only just
failed to get his blue. This disappointed him, and
he turned definitely to tennis. Then he fell in with'

money. The Adelaide Racing Club meeting, which
is m nearly all respects a duplicate of the S.A.J.C’s
follows immediately.
Jtist passed out, an old Riverina sports-
man, p j. Heffernan, of Millbank, near Junee, aged
78. He owned several good horses in his time,
amongst them Drumstick, winner of some of the best
prizes in the Ma State’s west.

Tasmanian Racing Club has had the joy
of unravelling another “ring-in.” Somebody noticed
informality in the lease of a prad entered as Gerzeta.
this started an inquiry, which ended in Gerzeta. Ter-
ilba (successful in Queensland and Northern N.S.WY)
and Inverell (a champion in pony-racing circles)
being found to be the same much-travelled animal,
then the T.R.C. took a hand, and those concerned
received the honor of a disqualification for “life ”

This is the astonishing record of War-
step, the best speed animal in Loan Land. As a
two-year-old she started seven times, was unplaced
on five occasions, and had two wins—the Dunedin
Stakes and the Dunedin Railway Plate. As a three-
year-old she started 10 times and was unplaced only
thrice. She won the Stewards’ Handicap, Stead Gold
Cup and Islington Plate, was second in M.L. Derby
and M.L. Oaks, and was third in Great Autumn
Handicap, all run at Riccarton. She got third place
in the Dunedin Guineas. In the season just finished,
as a four-vear-old, she was sent away 12 times and
only failed to get a place twice. She dead-heated
with Indigo in the M.L. Cup, won the Auckland Cup,
Auckland Plate, Dunedin Cup, Hazlett Memorial
Plate, Great Autumn Handicap and Trentham Gold
Cup. She ran second in the Canterbury Cup and
Islington Plate and third in the Stead ' Gold Cup.
Altogether she has started 29 times and, including
the dead-heat with Indigo in the M.L. Cup, has had
12 firsts, four seconds and three thirds. During
her short career she has won close on £lO,OOO for
her lucky owner. C. G. Dalgety, in stake-money alone.
There is a chance that she may be seen on Austra-
lian courses next season.
* * * *
Another M.L. record has been obliterated.
Two-year-old Desert Gold, which hasn’t missed a
place in 12 starts, has gathered £3740 in stake-
moneys— £670 more than the figures to the credit of
Autumnus.

The Sports Protection League of Maori-
land sees the shadow of special war taxation round
tlie corner, and has lifted a yell to scare the beast
away. C. P. Skerrett, K.C., chairman, has issued a
protest that while the League will yield to none in
willingness to do the fair thing', it reckons it would
be unjust to put a special tax on football, cricket,
tennis, jockey’ clubs, etc. One of Skerrett's arguments
is that if additional handicap is put on the totalisa-
tor it will conduce to illicit betting with book-
makers. It might, but the extent of it would be
comparatively’ trifling. As showing the increased
money raised from racing clubs during the past few
years, the chairman of the League states that the
amount in 1909 was £29,645, and for the racing
year ended July, 1914, it was £107,813. He gives
it as his opinion that the real object of those urging
further taxation on the racing game is to strangle it.
There is, no doubt, a good deal in the statement.
The killjoys are utilising the war as a lever to
forward their darling fads for the regeneration of the
race.

Sam Jacobs (everybody calls him “Sam”)
has been congratulated by Adelaide Tattersall’s Club
on his 25th year of chairmanship. Strictly speak-
ing, it is not quite that, because he retired from
office 1906 to 1909, but otherwise he has been there
since 1890. And he is one of the busiest men in
Adelaide otherwise. Being chairman of theS.A. Brewing
Co. directorate is no idle job these times, and for years
he was at the head of the University's finance com-
mittee. H. P. McLaehlan (for owners) and G. A.
Nelson (for Tattersalls’ other chief element) handed
over a silver tray and a Wedgwood coffee-set, and
mentioned how lucky the club considered itself to
have Jacobs’s services. It was no idle talk, either.
He was a practising lawyer for some years before he
took to commerce, and is by common consent the
ideal man to whom to refer any dispute, whether in
sport or business.
TOM COWLER,
English heavyweight.
The abandonment of the Goodwood (Eng.)
race meeting, fixed for the last four days in July,
was a foregone ' conclusion, quite apart from the
question of stopping other race-meetings in this time
of Britain’s tribulation. The Goodwood course is in
the Duke of Richmond’s park, and a terribly large
proportion of its “fashionable gathering” of a year
ago is now dead, wounded or in a state of recent
bereavement. Moreover, a lot of the surviving pun-
ters are at the Front. Goodwood this year would
have been a grim and ghostly function, and not even
lkey Mo’s shouts of 6 to 4 on the feeld could have
given it a festive character.

Jeff Smith —the man who cut McGoorty to
pieces a couple of years ago —was beaten before he
started fighting at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night.
His offensive was broken, his big guns captured, and
his mobility ruined by Blue Funk. He left his corner
to meet the blithe and eager Les Darcy as nervous as
a rabbit. Before the first round was over every
judge of boxing in the audience realised that he was
doomed ; and he probably knew it better than the
onlookers. The Maitland youngster landed four times
to his one, and landed hard and clean. Except when
Jeff was claiming one of his arms Darcy hit pretty
well where he wished. The Yankee's footwork, which
stood to him so. well in his great fight with Clabby,
was useless against the rugged, rushing local cham-
pion. When Smith entered upon the second round
his countenance wore a great resolve to get in out
of the storm without a second’s unnecessary delay.
Amidst a hurricane of straight lefts and right-crosses
from Darcy he aimed a blow which would have been
foul had it landed. Working towards the centre of
the ring he next butted the Australian in the face
with his head. Then came his master-blow—a right
hook to the crutch. Darcy had apparently provided
himself with a bullet-proof shield since his last
encounter with the U.S. champion. Anyhow, though
he winced, he was ready to go on. But the intention
was so obvious that Harald Baker had to act, and,
amid a storm of hoots for Smith, he declared the
other man the winner. Smith was palpably relieved,
and hastened to wring Darcy’s hand. It was signifi-
cant that not a moan or other funeral note was heard
from his usually vociferous corner. The offence was
too flagrant for convincing protest. It is to be hoped
that Smith will never again be matched with Darcy.
The latter’s shields may then be heavier, and the
finish of it will be that Smith will break one of his
hands. Meanwhile, his share of the gate has been
withheld pending an inquiry by the Stadium
authorities.
* * * *
An old Australian boxing identity. Sam
Nixon, has just taken the count in England. He
was pretty busy in ring matters a quarter of a cen-
tury ago, and figured as a staunch supporter of
Frank Slavin. Like many a pug of those days he
ran a hotel—the Commercial in Carlton (Vie.)
being one of his ventures—and was the owner of a
beer pump when the gong sounded.
The picturesque yarn that Jack Johnson
was handed the wallop that ended his fight with
Willard while his head was turned to smile at his
wife, is somewhat discredited by the fact that
Mrs. J. left the ringside in the 25th chapter of
Exodus. The cowboy delivered the amen in the fol-
lowing round.
A gibe having been made about the
alleged reluctance of pugs, to go and punch holes in
the aborigines of Germany, Bombardier Wells stepped
forward and put his ease: “There are five of us boys,
and we are not a rich family. It was decided at the
start that four should go, and that as 1 could earn
more than the rest I should look after the family.
My brother Alf rejoined the 3rd Battalion of the Rifle
Brigade in Ireland before he got his mobilisation
papers, and has given his life. Sid is a dispatch
rider on the Headquarters Staff, Albert is in the
Seaforth Highlanders, and Harold, who was not 19
when the war broke out, has joined the Essex
Regiment. I am hoping to earn enough money in
the next month Or so to make my family comfortable,
and then I am ready. Really, at the moment, my
duty is here, and I have the moral courage to say
so.'’ Judgment for defendant.
Of his 36 ring fights. Willard, the
champion heavy slugger of the world, has won 29
by the knock-out.
Alf Felton and Charlie Towns made good
their second deposit ( £75 each) to the stake-holder,
at Sydney, on Saturday for the coming .tussle for the
N.S.W. sculling championship. Felton (who is aided
by Syd Kemp) is training at Middle Harbor, and
Towns (with brother George) is working on the
Parramatta. The tussle is due for June 26.
The Belgian carnival on the Parramatta
on June 7 is likely to be one of the finest shows
seen on that historic water. Motor boats, row boats,
hydroplanes, skills, warship cutters —all will race
in their classes. Perhaps the biggest draw will be
the world’s ex-champions’ sculling race. Besides Bill
Beach and Peter Kemp, big Jim Stanbury will start,
and the colors of those men on the river again will
he a stirring sight.

As was expected, Fred Lindrum out-cued
brother Walter at Melbourne last week in their
match of 16,000 up for the championship of Austral-
asia. Nevertheless, the younger billiardist showed
up well and was given the loud hand of applause
when, on Saturday afternoon, he broke into the
lead with a well-compiled 111. That, however, was
where he began to peter out; he was under-
strengthed for the task, and the game closed with
him 729 behind. During the fortnight’s play—too
long for the younger and less experienced man —-he
averaged over 30 and scored 50 breaks of 100 and
upwards. Fred’s average was 33 and he made 54
breaks of 100 and upwards.

Most of the sporting bodies in Sydney
on Empire Day put forward special efforts to swell
the funds for the Belgians. Chief amongst them,
apart from the A.J.G. race meeting at Randwick,
was the Rugby League’s carnival at the Cricket
Ground. The main item on the programme, was a
match between teams representing the city and the
Northern branches, and about 12,000 spectators
watched the metropolitan players win by 31 points
to 19, after being one point behind at half-time.
* * * *
Nearly 18,000 brethren of the hall in
Sydney watched the main League Rugby match on
Saturday—Balmain v. Eastern Suburbs —on the
Cricket Ground. Probably no harder-fought game has
been witnessed in the League’s competitions. Both
teams jumped in with a spirit and dash that showed
what each had expected and trained for. The scores
(Balmain 14 points to Eastern Suburbs 7 points) are
not evidence of the; fortunes of the game—of its yell-
raising attacks, swift repulses and sweeping counter-
attacks. At the finish hoarse-voiced barrackers of
both persuasions blew the froth off the usual, and
agreed that it was good goods.
Other games panned out: Glebe, 28, v. North
Sydney, 7 ; Newtown, 18, v. Western Suburbs, 3 ;
South Sydney, 14, v. Annandale, 5. The' competition
table reads : Glebe, 6; Balmain, 5; South Sydney and
Eastern Suburbs, 4 ; Newtown, 3 ; North Sydney, 2 :
Annandale and Western Suburbs, nix.
The features of Saturday’s toeball in
Melbourne were . mud and the uprising of South.
Latter had won no game this season, and the weed’s
rest, owing to the “bye,’! apparently did it good;
also the replacing of over-seasoned veterans by prom-
ising novices helped a lot. Whatever the cause, the
effect was that the hitherto-unbeaten ’Roy was'donkey-
walloped by 56 points to 40. It was a gay and
festive evening where South’s barrackers foregathered
that night. Refreshed by their victory over Carlton,
the ’Dons met St. Kilda and nearly lost the game,
bv default, through undue delay in entering the ground.
The umpire had even bounced the ball when the
“Same Old’’ sprinted out to their places. There was
no lagging about them after that. They gave the
Saints no rest, playing with wonderful accuracy in
the sticky mud, and ending with a tally of 52 points
to 40. The unbeaten Magpies accommodated Geelong
with a liberal dose of the medicine they have
handed their previous victims, 62 points to Geelong’s
30 being the measure. The Hollow doesn’t boast
the team of other years; reinforcements are needed.
Carlton beat Melbourne, 72 to 51, but the collisions
of thepe teams ar° ever more in the nature of friendly
reunions than strenuous scuffles.
The best Ass. game, between -Town and
’Scray, was a tremendous struggle. When the mud-
stained, used-up battlers finally got away to the
show T erbaths the board showed: ’Town, 26 points;
’Scrav. 21. Brunswick walloped Port after an all-in
scrimmage that threatened to break into open war-
fare ; but before actual hostilities opened the time-
keeper chipped in. Scores: ’Wick, 65 points; Port,
56.

Previous to the alterations made'at the
Premiers’ Conference regarding the treatment of sol-
diers travelling on State-owned trains, a party of
about 20 of them considered that, they were all
journeying together on a South Aus. line, they should
be given a concession. When they made the applica-
tion they were gravely informed /hat it couldn’t be
done, if they had been a team of footballers or
cricketers it would have been all right, but as they
weren’t they would have to pay” the full rate. Then

Maoriland Rugby League in its latest
despatch to N. S. Wales League explains that it is
owing to depleted ranks that it will not be able to
send a detachment across the Tasman : iri June; but
the reason lies deeper. Two or three M.L. newspapers
making the same howl as the Sydney Telegraph,
said the very idea was scandalous. Then the busy
interviewer got to work; and instead of being met
with the silent tongue that is evidence of the wise
head, M.L. League officials were led into expressing
unwithdrawable opinions on the wisdom or “scandal’’
of sending a team to the Ma State and Bananaland.
This before a joint official decision could be made.
It all left the M.L. League in a position where it
had to hedge; and it has hedged by explaining that
it will despatch a team in August. Things, of
course, will be all right in August; and the shortage
in men will, naturally, have been overcome!
Although heavily drained of players,
Maoriland Rugby Union sees no reason why inter-
club and inter-union games should be dropped. The
annual report puts it this way: “Although a large
proportion of last year’s senior players will be
absent on active service there will be no dearth of
younger players to fill their places, and from many
points of view it is of importance that the youth of
the Dominion should be afforded every opportunity
of keeping themselves phvsically and mentally fit.”
Which is a sane way of looking at things.
* * * *
The Union met financial disaster at
every turn last season. The Australian tour
showed a loss of £1025, the net receipts being only
£396. The North v. South Island match cost £149 ;
and other items swelled the deficiency to £1416.
The _ Union, nevertheless, begins the season with a
credit -balance of £B9lB, and a determination to go
slow until the smoke of battle rolls off and the big
guns make way for the big “gates.” It is safe to
sav that a Maoriland team will tour Britain when the
time is ripe, and it’s equally sure that a good team
would have a great reception. However, it's too
early to speculate on that yet.
Some idea of how Maoriland’s toeballers
are rolling into camp can be gauged by the fact
that the other da.y a team representing the volunteers
played a representative team drawn from Welling-
ton City and dumped it in the mud to the tune of
17 to nil! The scrap took place at Athletic Park
in the presence of 2000 delighted spectators, and the
proceeds were handed to the M.L. Wounded Soldiers’
Fund. Incidentally, one of Wellington’s most historic
clubs, Melrose, has petered right out since the march
to the Front set in.
The famous Pirates Club, of Dunedin
(M.L.), easily tops the honors list. It has 60
members playing the game with a coffin in it.
The whole of last year’s first-grade 15 are either in
the firing line or in training for it.

J. J. Wallace, Ma’s newest police inspector,
used to be prominent in field games; but nowa-
days when off the beat he is mostly at the butts,
and is one of the best shots among the thousands of
riflemen in N. S. Wales.

The wrestling boom among N.S.W. coal-
miners developed at Wollongong last week into a
match between A. Holmer, of Port Kembla, and
Jim Daniels, of Kurri Kurri, for the lightweight
championship of the continent, and a side-wager ot
£25. The conditions were catch-as-cateh-ean, best
two out of three falls. According to announcement,
the men faced each other weighing 9st. 131 b.
Holmer, the more experienced and skilful ’rastler,
took the first two falls, and so ended the argument.
He and the Japanese Shima will probably be the
next to star in the game, which refuses to burn up
to more than a glimmer.
Clarence Weber, who stands for the best
at catch-as-catch-can wrestling in Australia, has been
dragged from his retirement by one David Smith, of
Adelaide. Weber and Smith meet at the Exhibition
Building, Adelaide, next Saturday. On paper it looks
a good even go, as both ’rastlers scale about level
weights-; —14st. —-and stand 6ft. or thereabouts. Smith
is backing his chance with good quidlets; but the
combined strength, agility and experience of the tall
Victorian are likely to prove too much for the
challenger to defeat.
. *■ * *
Queensland Cyclists’ Union stiffened its
back over the recent one-mile championship at Bris-
bane, when 10 out of 17 entrants went on strike over
the condition of the track. The Union used its
heaviest axe on the crowd and suspended them “until
further notice.” The biff raises the most dust in
the Australian Cyclists’ Union kitchen for many
years, the only sweep of move dimensions being by
the N.S.W.O.A. in 1902, when 19 riders were sus-
pended for life for accepting hard bullion in lieu
of a teapot or saucepan.
* * * *
Floyd McFarland, whose death is re-
ported from U.S.A., was probably the greatest handi-
cap cyclist the world ever cheered. He made three
trips to Australia, arid in the 1904 jaunt recorded
the fastest Australian time for a mile—lmin. 49sec.
In six-day events he shared two in N’Yark (with
Harry Elkes in 1900, and Moran in 1907) and one
in Berlin (also with Moran in 1907). The shindy-
kit which proposed to swoop on Australia next
January w T as controlled by McFarland, and the ven-
ture will therefore stand on its head to cool in-
definitely.

Although only four rounds have been
played, Sydney baseball premiership is in a bedraggled
state. Leichhardt (thus-far unbeaten) is leading,
followed by Waverley and Petersham. The other
five clubs are in death-grips to keep off the bottom
rung of the ladder. The clash between Waverley
(last year’s premiers) and Petersham, on the latter s
cowpatch, on Saturday, was expected to raise dust,
but although the local barrackers howled like a
thousand demons, the dwellers by the sea smashed
the suburbanites by 12 runs to five.

There was remarkable baseball at
Kogarah, (Sydney) on Saturday, when Carlton, which

Veteran Horace Rice (N.S.W.) recently
defeated 26 others in the Westralian metropolitan
singles,. Rice —the only State rep. outside Groperland
at the Perth carnival—defeated A. 11. Hedeman in the
final by 6 2, 6—2, 6—2. In the doubles—in which
there were 19 pairs—Kelsey and Stokes ate up Eaton
and Fraser in the final by 6—2, 6—o, 6 —4.

Sydney’s premier amateur athletic club
is the South Sydney, and it has woke up to the fact
that none of its members live in that district. It is
therefore looking for a new name, and some unkind
person has suggested Graball, in view of the way it
collars the talent from surrounding districts. As a
counter-stroke, some followers of the game are trying
to inaugurate a strict residential basis for club
membership,

Sydney has gained and lost a Fellow of
the Royal Astronomical Society in a day.
Fellowships of this ancient and conservative
society are awarded for astronomical re-
search work. By the death of G. IT. Hirst
Sydney lost a man who wore his F.R.A.S.
in secret. He was a specialist on Mars;
but his drawings of Jupiter also figure in
the text-books. The day of Hirst’s death
T._ H. Close _was elected to the inner circle.
His long suit is mathematical calculation;
he can plan down the path of an erratic
comet with a certainty that would make the
fortune of a racing tipster.

The Licenses Reduction Board of Me. de-
cided that of the State’s 8460 pubs in 1906
(1020 metropolitan and 2440 country) 1377
must go. including 976 in the country. Down
to the middle of 1914 772 had lost their
licenses, so there are still 6.03 beer-pumps
to be torpedoed. On top of that there is
the growing agitation for 6 o’clock closing
-—already South Aus. has voted in favor of
it bv a big majority. And finally there is
the “keep-dry-on-account-of-tlie-war” boom
which will not only, affect present sales, but
is likely to get lots of people out of the
habit of “wetting it” on every possible occa-
sion. None of these things is going to help
the breweries, especially as they are usually
pretty large owners of pubs as well as
manufacturers of liquor. However, the
Volum Co. can still shew profits equal to
40 p.c. on the capital (£14,375). This
would not of course be possible without the
fine reserves. Having these accumulated
funds, the co.. although it has hotel proper-
ties valued at £20,189 in the books, does not
need the help of much outside monev. Rents
alone brought it in £llO2, whereas the
dividend for the half-year required only
£719. The licensed premises are kept very
well written down; and it is pretty certain
that compensation received for closing them
would equal the book value. If breweries
could be surer of the future this co.’s posi-
tion would be very cheerful.

It is assumed that the manager’s commis-
sion will be £lB9, which amount has been
deducted from the year’s profit. In this, as
in every other trustee concern, the share-
holders have one gi-eat advantage: not
more than about £lOO of their capital is
actually required in the business. That
much may be needed to buy a table and a
chair and a doormat and a feather-duster;
all the rest can be put to work on mortgage
or fixed deposit. In this case the paid
capital and reserves (including unappro-
priated profit) amount to £23,985, and no
less than £22,650 is out in mortgages and
debentui’es. Interest earnings bring in
nearly enough to pay a 12 p.e. div. " The
other 3 p.c. comes from commissions, etc.
As a matter of fact, the net commission
earnings are not, as a rule, dazzling,
though now and then the co. pulls out a
plum. The total value of trust estates on
hand is only £2,230,784; and it would be
easier to keep the earnings more uniform if
the co. handled five times as much. Some-
thing may, as in the past, happen to give
the profits a sudden lift. If it doesn’t, and
if the recent downward movement lasts a
couple of years more, the 15 p.c. div. will
be in jeopardy. The co. has no liabilities
worth mentioning. In that and other
respects it seems to be just about all a
trustee co. should be.
"Bullant” Mclntyre, of Southern Cross,
proposes a scheme of prospecting, and the
Westralian Government has agreed to back
it with 50 camels, an assay plant and a
geologist who knows more of field work than
of classifying specimens in a museum. The
Government contribution of camels, assayer
and geologist is to be the centre for the
operations of 100 privately-backed prospec-
tors. Mclntyre figures that 30 members
paying in 20s. a month each could keep in
the field three prospectors on half wages and
a half interest in their discoveries. For
the protection of the prospectors, each syndi-
cate should have three months’ funds in hand
at starting. The Chamber of Mines is to
appoint a supervisor to keep track of the
prospectors, and the syndicates concerned
will provide his salary pro rata. The Gov-
ernment camp gives five free assays a week
to each syndicate. Mclntyre holds that only
the sunburned gold of the West has been
found, and that what little systematic pros-
pecting by loaming has been done has found
blind reefs under the alluvium, as in the
Edna May and the Bullabulling, and that
most “prospecting” under the old. un-
supervised conditions have not been systema-
tised searches, but mere aimless roaming
about the bush, or long camping at a soak
until the prospector got tired of the one
place. The Edna May is within two miles
of a soak (Boodallin) known for 25 years,
Bullfinch is a mile off the Mount Jackson
road, and the Mountain Queen was pegged
and abandoned undeveloped in 1888. Mcln-
tyre’s job now is to get Westralia to knock
off paying into Tatt.’s sweeps and put the
money instead into these prospecting outfits.
Central and West Boulder has had its
annual roll-up in London. The reports men-
tioned that tribute work had been continued
on the two Kalgoorlie leases during the
year and the ore treated had averaged a
little over 7dwt. The Nigerian tin areas
had been under a cloud since the war began.
One property, known as the Damo, was
tipped to “sooner or later give a good
account of itself.”

ME, CHAIRMAN. AND GENTLEMEN,—
You do me great honor by calling upon me to speak here to-night.
I support the toast of my friend with the greatest pleasure that I have ever experienced at any gathering in my
business career. The world is full of men who know how to run the other fellow’s business, but we are short of men
who can take a business of their own and run it successfully. And I say that the men who guide the destinies of
Chateau Tanunda Limited are trained protagonists of the new spirit of trade —the spirit which recognises that
there is a large element of science even in the smallest transaction of barter and trade.
In all the world the one desire of everything, animate or inanimate, is to be supreme. The reason is plain—
the greater the supremacy the greater the reward. Every single stalk, in a field of wheat strives to thrust its head
above the others, so that it may be the first to catch the rays of the morning sun.
And, Gentlemen, the directors of Chateau Tanunda Limited have, met with a reward that tl§ey deserve The
service they ha-e done this great country in the development of the Brandy Industry is one that, cannot be’light! v
passed over. This Company, over twenty years ago, set out to produce a brandy that would favorably compare witii
tbe foreign spirit. And what have they done? They have, in my opinion, gone one better in their march of
progress, and made a better, a purer, a more mellow and a finer brandy than is being made in or out of Australia
to-day, not excepting the best foreign productions. To know of the wonders of our own land is a duty as well as a
privilege, and not to know the great and romantic building, the Chateau at Tanunda, in South Australia is to be
ignorant of one of Australia’s greatest and most costly enterprises'.
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, with the greatest cordiality and feelings of friendship towards my friends-the
company of Messrs. Chateau Tanunda Limited—l support the toast.
The late eminent Surgeon, Dr. WAY, stated that he used CHATEAU TANUNDA
BRANDY for a considerable time in his professional work, and his advocacy was due to
his knowledge of its special excellence and purity as a PURE GRAPE SPIRIT distilled
from PURE GRAPE JUICE ONLY. It is also used in all the principal Hospitals
throughout South Australia, the Sydney and Prince Alfred Hospitals in New South Wales
the Hospitals in West: Australia, and is highly recommended by the medical profession in
Victoria. -

Norman Lindsay’s Praise,
Dear Mr. Mclntosh, —I have just come from seeing
“Cabiria,” and I must congratulate you on having he
the means of showing Australia the most wonderful fil
ever produced here. It is more than a mere film produt
tion in the usual sense, for, apart from its astonishing
mechanical construction, it is an artistic triumph o
very highest order. I have always had a suspicion that
what was wrong with most actors is that they know o\v
to act. The consequence is that one always makes
distinction between an actor and a human being. In this
superb film the realism is so perfect that one never su -
pects the presence of an actor. I have never had such a
sensation of reality as in the presence of tins work of art.
The gesture, the expression of emotion, the understan
ing of each individual character is so wonderful y
restrained and finished that the effect is powerful beyond
anything I, for one, have ever seen on the stage. Ihe
accuracy with which the period has been presented is
astonishing, so vast is the ground of research that it
covers. This is a real vision of antiquity, not onlj in it.
manners and mentality, but in the outward semblance of
its dress, houses, streets and peoples. Every detail
perfect. Its scientific exactitude is equal to its wonderfu
artistry. As a production its educational value is beyon
expression. Having once seen it no one could ever forget
it, and to have seen it is to have seen the ancient world.
I wish, for the better intelligence of this community, that
every school child in Australia were taken to this rare
performance. They would learn more of Rome and
Carthage in two hours than in two years of school teach-
ing.—With the best regards ever,
vnuM \ V TiTNDSAY.

unsigned white feathers through the post... .11.A.G..

Camerasian: What a distressingly bad Australian
you always are when the picture business is on deck.
S.S.H.: Thanks. Ask that M.L. paper to be
explicit, and say which Australian business it is
that is “run by Germans for Germans.” It will find
that the language of the subsequent writ will be good
Australian, anyway... .M.8.P.: Sorry “Heroes” can-
not storm this office. .. .E.J.O’C.: One way to drive
the Germans back is to take some verse of that sort
to the Front''■‘and read it to them A.W.F.: You
mean well, but that doesn’t save you from being dull.

seas.” out of this office? People trip over them and
then blame us for leaving rolled carpets lying about.
.... Pewter: Better embrace the usual quantity of
good, refreshing beer. You can’t beat yourself into
spurious half-crowns on our counter. .. .W.H.L.: Good
sentiment, but the verse is bumpy King W.: We
don’t drink that brand. .. .William V.: So the trooper
got out of the fix by proposing to the lady-bush-
ranger, and they settled down in the Far West until
the pardon arrived by post. Make a novel out of it.
Ozone: That blushful old story about the ants
and the curate’s pants wears well, doesn’t it? Trouble
is that, if we printed it, the Methodist- Conference
would give up passing a yearly vote of confidence in
the Religious Editor, and he would be reduced to a
half-pay deacon An Investigator: Why this rush
for enlightenment? Who are you, and where are
you writing from? Also, what are you writing
about? Bellerive: A little commercial verse: —
....Triple X.: Don’t care for post-office addresses,
thanks. In plain Australian, did you write them or
did you steal them? Specktonian: Jog-trot, homely
verse without much punch. You might find a place
for it in some other gaper. ... L. AY. (Q.) : It _is one
sort of verse, “L.W.,” but not one of the many sorts
we use Nauticus: Will keep-your guilty ’secret,
but not the MS. It isn’t really as dangerous us ygy
think— -or as interesting... .8.F.5.: Fair jingle, but
it isn’t a subject' for laughter. In any case, it is
late.. . .M.J.8.: Posting bade verses, which are out
of our line. Try them on another rag. Charles A.
(Q.) : The creaky sort of humor that depends largely
on the dropping of-the letter “h.” ... . D.J.H.: Not
salable here Grubber: Graceful, but uneven, and
the idea is not new... ..Naugh Said : You amused your-
self ; let that suffice.... .E.J.O’C.: Three young verse-

tache on sideways ? Is it arranged so in order to
terrify the deaf private? M.A.C.: Mild, old-maid-
enly jest. . AD.C.: Guess you built it in a school-
. room. The melee in the background is humorous, but
the rest of the drawing doesn’t raise a smile.... -
A. 0.8.: Drawings are poor and jokes old and un-
pleasant.
Berthed for the last time, Captain Alex.
Hacking, for more- than 20 years the most
daring and skilful pilot in Newcastle, which
is easily the worst port in Australia for deep-
sea ships. When Coalopolis is busiest four
vessels lie abreast along the Dyke, and when
it came to shifting the one inside the tier
in half a gale of wind, without room to swing
a cat, no one could do the job so neatly as
Hacking. Latterly he was Superintendent
of Navigation, but that was a mild, Sunday-
morning worm-hunting job by comparison.
Concerning, another notable who is
J“upset” :
Sir Edgar Speyer, foremost of the gang of Ger-
man “Britishers” who long time influenced the
-policy of the Liberal Freetrade Party, has -offered
to resign the baronetcy and Privy Councillorshjp
which he practically bought. He is German by birth
;and education. As a young man he was a working
partner in the Frankfort house of Speyer, and as a
-middle-aged alien in England he married Fraulein
von Stosch, so he can s t even talk about his dear
English wife and children. He only talks about
unjust aspersions upon his loyalty. Speyer may not
have been so conspicuously earnest a worker as others
in the patriotic war against naval estimates. But
;?he was a shining light of the Little Navy party, a
derider of Lord Roberts’s “alarmist statements, a
.friend and flatterer of the fatuous Lord Haldane, and
an object of suspicion to the few intelligent students
-of Germany’s doings prior to the war. It is easy to
think that Haldane was duped by his leg-pulling
patron of Potsdam. It is not so easy to think that
the commercial magnates who were right in the
know of German schemes could possibly have worked
so persistently to' prevent any increase in British
-armaments save for the purpose of keeping Britain
impotent to oppose Germany’s designs on Russia,
France and Belgium. Their loyalty is no different
■froth that of a good few aliens in Australia —Germans
-and Swedes mostly—who, while professing to side
with the Allies, are forever protesting that “Dis
young coundry vos wrong to sendt her men to der
Var.” ..
PASSAGES AND RECOLLECTIONS IN VERSE-
FOURTH BATCH.
A. LOT OF OTHER THINGS.
You missed a lot of bargains,
Said a dealer to a friend ;
The auctioneer grew wearied before
The sale came to an end.
1 bought a pile of music
And a box of brummie Rings,
A looking glass and razor
And a lot of other things,
For china cups and saucers
There were high and random Bids
And knocked down for a shilling
Was a cask of rusty Lids.
Mrs. Murphy made an offer
For two old garden swings,
Which was sold for half a dollar
With a lot of other things.

IN BANANA LAND
The 19.15 State election in Queensland
will be known as the Butter Battle. Every
meeting in Brisbane has whirled round this
greasy pivot, and the voices of Denham and
Barnes disavowing their. responsibility for
cow-grease at 2s. a lb. has been inexpressibly
touching.
Passed out, Magnus; Jensen, a Legislative
Councillor but not a Fossil. Queensland
had no more upright man than Jensen, and
Democracy no more faithful adherent. A
scholarship boy, a school-teacher and a soli-
citor in turn, he was in every department a
clean-handed, capable. man whom -no one
mistrusted,
Bananaland Legislative Council won’t
know itself when it meets again and misses
the venerable phiz of Andrew Barlow. There
are now three vacancies in the Fossils
and about 500 aspirants. It is safe to pre-
dict that a pure-blooded Teuton won’t be
appointed this time. The death of Barlow
will probably raise again the vexed question
in the Liberal camp of the unwisdom of
of the. unwisdom of wasting a whole port-
folio in the House of Peers, where votes
don’t really matter, when good commoners
go hungry and unrewarded.
“F. 8.”: According to World’s Work,
Bishop Frodsham, just appointed Arch-
deacon of Rochester, was responsible for the
Tropical Diseases Institute at Townsville.
Then Frodsham did more to spread the pes-
tilent notion that North Q. is the peculiar
home of tropical ailments than any man in
Australia. As a fact, N.Q. to-day produces
no more tropical diseases than South Queens-
is practically none at all —
and the Institute is worried to death to find
cases to go on with.
Six Labor reps, were returned unopposed
to the Assembly. The aggregate area of
their kingdoms amounts to 331,670 square
miles, or somewhere in the neighborhood of
the areas <?f Germany and Austria com-
bined. The smallest of the half-dozen elec-
torates would swallow up Belgium and Den-
mark and leave a fair-sized city allotment
to spare. Victoria could be stowed away in
either’of the two largest and still leave room ,
to hang out the washing; while Tasmania
could be tucked into the smallest and enough
space would be left over for several Mexican
revolutions.
The N. S. Wales Public Works Committee
has been in Brisbane sounding Railway Com-
missioner Evans about linking-up with Syd-
ney by a shorter line. There are two less
serpentine routes than the present—one along
the coast connecting with Murwillumbah and
Tweed ; the other via Kyogle and Richmond
Gap. In both the question of gauge is the
stumbling block. Evans, in his answers to
the Sydney catechists, would pin himself to
little beyond an acknowledgment that it was
up to the politicians to make a short cut.
He Thought there was room for both the pro-
jected lines, and seemed inclined to give
way ,to the X.S.W. gauge for the Kyogle
but stuck to his toy size for the
coast route.
“Cleveland”: Shortly after the volcano
broke out it was found that a northern
harbor-master was a Teuton, and the De-
fence Department requested that he be re-
lieve’d on general principles.* Bishop Barnes,
the’ Minister in charge, snivelled that the
Teuton was) an old, valued- and trusted ser-
vant; but when the Defence Department
shouted again, Barnes despatched his friend
on a 7()<X-odd-mile trip to soften the blow,
and another man was given temporary
charge. It is now discovered that the old.
THE WORM THAT TURNED.
BYSTANDER: “Hullo, what's the fight about, sonny?"
SONNY : “The driver said he'd plug the next cove wot give him advice how to start the
horse, an' he’s doin’ it.”
valued and trusted servant has continued to
reside in the harbor-master’s residence in the
midst of an important centre, of shipping in-
telligence. Questions that naturally arise
are: (1) Can any German be trusted while
the present scrap is on? (2) If the foregoing
cannot be answered in the affirmative, what
right has Barnes to play fast and loose with
the interests of Australia?
“McNorth” on the movement to get a
meteorological station for the North :
In support of his allegation that I misstated my
case “Globe Cairns” (B. 18/3/T5) says that “dis-
turbances are discernible days ahead,” and that
“North Bananaland has been telegraphically isolated
for only two days in the last four years. 2 ’ It is
quite true that occasionally in the case of large dis-
turbances, like “Sigma” and “Leonta,” their approach
can be observed some time in advance. But the
terrific violence of such uproars is not necessary to
shift'a. town or stand a ship wrong way up. In fact,
it has often been remarked jifter a big blow that half
the force would have beenfij^ffidmnt. to cause all the
damage. Buildings are just as liable to be unroofed
and flattened, and vessels at sea are in the same
danger of being foundered, by the little local storms
which generate and approach in a few hours, as by
the big overgrown devastation which advertises itself
days ahead. Also, the frequency of the' “lines inter-
rupted” notice at Northern ports in the cyclone
season is the subject of much lurid conversation
amongst shipmasters and other mariners. It is evi-
dent that too much time is occupied in telegraphing
observations to Brisbane and then sending them
north, even if the telegraphic service is working
satisfactorily. We want to diagnose the weather
symptoms as near the scene of likely trouble as
possible, and dispense with this absurd and dangerous
system of wiring them over long distances. But I
suppose the old foolishness will continue, for the
establishment of a weather bureau in the North would
savor of decentralisation. And decentralisation in the
eyes of a lot of people down South is the eighth
deadly sin.
There will be three Ryans in the new Par-
liament. Big Ryan, who will be Premier,
seems to have secured the largest individual
majority of apy candidate at the polls.
One surprise of the elections was the tfejec-
tion of Jimmy Blair, Minister for Justice
and the one good speaker in the Dehham
' Government. He had managed to hold the
Ipswich seat so long that it was thought he
couldn’t be shifted. Blair once threw away
a judgeship by refusing an offer from Kidston
•to go _to ,Townsville. He wanted Brisbane
jurisdiction. Now Jimmy has a seat neither
in Parliament nor on the Bench.

QUEENSLAND.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, May 22, 1915.
My Dear Thargojiindah,—
We delivered ourselves of our Belgian Day
yesterday, and I am still in tatters. Two
thousand pounds was the rake-up in
cash. The Follies, led by Jack Cannot and
Isabel D’Armond, were responsible for a big
share of the total. Little Eileen Watson,
Vera Pearce (despite a painful accident on
the previous evening) and of
others helped to shake the town till its last
spare copper fell out.
A skating carnival in aid of wounded sol-
diers drew a profitable house to the Coliseum
rink on Wednesday night. His Ex. and Lady
(lOold-Adams were there, and A. H. Wliit-
tingham, M.L.C., and his handsome wife
helped to fill the vice-regal pen. James Love
auctioned a flag, and, as usufil, slipped an
unobtrusive £5 bid in for himself. The bunt-
ing realised nearly £6O, A. 11. Whittingham
being the purchaser. It was after-
wards presented to the guard of honor, drawn
from the Valley (7B Area). About £175
was raked in at the show, which, added to
what we’ve got, makes just a little bit more,
as somebody used to warble.
Mrs. A. Benjamin, the handsome wife of
an equally well-liked husband, sails to Fog-
land to bid God-speed to son Arthur, who has
got a commission with the Royal Fusiliers.
Brisbane looks upon the youth as one of the
most promising musicians that ever sailed
out of its river.
_ Misses Watt, of New Farm, entertained a
big party of guests on Wednesday afternoon,
in honor of Miss Martha Burns, who, as I
told you before, was busy nursing wounded
Tommies until her own health broke down.
The guest retailed some of her reminiscences
and enhanced them by showing round some
grisly souvenirs from battlefields. One was
a dum-dum bullet, the nose of which was
flattened a little wider than a threepenny-
piece. Any soldier who stops a bullet like
that is certain to shed the limb that meets it.
The Imperial Service Club is to be offici-
als opened by the Governor on Tuesday
night. After that, members of the Expedi-
tionary Force, and as many of their best girls
as the building can accommodate, will have
the run of the place during Monday and
Wednesday afterfigons, and on any evening
when there is a special entertainment. Other
times the place is for the soldier man.
Mrs. Billy Ahles gave a coin-afternoon
this week —for the Belgians, as usual. The
guests had to contribute according to their
height, and Mrs,. Ahles carefully selected
all the tallest, women of her acquaintance—
sacrgjj name of charity.
The Musical Union served'up “Elijah” on
Tuesday night. Andrew Black, engaged for
the tuneful occasion, thrilled the Exhibition
Hall with his big mellow organ ; Mrs. Gil-
bert Wilson aired a voice to match her
artistic appearance; and Miss Betty Cock-
burii, hitherto heard only in ballads, handled
the difficult contralto work with much
power.
The aeroplane which Tom Macleod and his
satellites are building has had pretty big diffi-
culties to contend with owing to lack of
necessary fittings. You see, Thargomindah,
the politicians object to Australians making
such things, so they have to be imported from
Germany or somewhere. This having been
successfully accomplished, the rest is easy
enough, and before long the simple villagers
will be developing stiff necks, through trying
to watch the members of the Volunteer Fly-
ing Corps hovering in Larkville.
One of the Ross Munro boys. Jack ('han-
dler, Ralph Clifton and several other young
fighting spirits, leave next Aveek to join King
Edward’s Horse.
The doll f@te for the inotor-ambulance on
June 12 promises to be a skinner. Plenty
of dolls have been given, and now the pro-
moters are saying, with a sweet smile: ‘‘A
cash donation will do just as well.”
A well-known Brisbane girl, Miss Bell,
who went to Europe as nurse, was aboard
the Falaba when it was torpedoed. She
tells how some of her friends ran down to
get their money. “I had mine on me in a
bag sewn round my knee,” she says. With
what mysterious hiding-places does the sex
abound! Anyway, she saved both herself
and her money, as any girl like that de-
served to do.
Aviator Jones, who is also instructor of
the Queensland Flying Corps, was married
to dainty Islet Brest at St. Mark’s Church.
Warwick, recently. The pair went off
honeymooning in a motor-car instead of
stepping into the Jones biplane and soaring
up into the heaven which is the only fit
abiding for lioneymooners.
Passed atvay, after an operation for
appendicitis, Dr. Edith Ure, a lady
deservedly popular among suffering woman-
kind. Brisbane has only two lady medicoes
now —Dr. Lilian Cooper and Dr. Eleanor
Greenham, both of them very busy, despite
the fierce competition, with male comrades
endowed with a nice bedside manner.
Alas, somebody else always says the good
things first! My lady who last week told the
loud caf6 youths that the worst man who
had left Australia for the Dardanelles was
better than the best man who stayed at
home was merely an imperfect echo of par-
son Cosh at the Seotclibyterian Assembly.
The more cautious meenister had thrown iij,
a qualification : there may be men so Placed
that they can best serve the Empire by
staying where they are. For instance, I
don’t suppose anybody suggests that Defence
Minister Pearce would do better work by
going into the trenches.
The women students of the University
have started a branch of the Red Cross
Society. They have had only one meeting
so far, but judging by the amount of work
turned out the blue stockings are liable to
leave their more or less domesticated sisters
far behind in the rush to pile up comforts
for the Australian on service or in hospital,
Lena Hammond and Gladys Frost, two
popular musicians, are organising a concert
for June 10 in aid of the funds of the Im-
perial Service Club, Of course, it will
la success. ;
Yours affectionately,
AUSTBALIA JANE.
H. F. Hardacre is the one member of the
Queensland Labor party who has had Minis-
terial experience. He is the sole survivor in
the Assembly of the Ministry which Andy
• Dawson formed in 1899 and which just had
time to look up some interesting documents
before Philp combined the scattered forces of
the Liberals and threw them out six days
later. That, by the way, was Andrew
Fisher’s first small taste of office. He was
Minister for Railways and Works. Dawson,
Fitzgerald (the only lawyer in the crowd)
and Browne are dead; Kidston is provided
for otherwise; Turley is in the Senate.
Hardacre at that time was the Lands special-
ist of the party.
No other Australian Ministry ever came
so bad a smash as Denham’s did on Satur-
day. Unless late results make changes
wholly unexpected, only two Ministers will
gee back, and they are men who have not
been conspicuous. The massacre stretched
from Denham, the Premier, down to
Douglas, who was taken into the team only
the other day, and included Philp, who has
been threatened at Townsville for 25 years,
but always hung on till now. The House
will hardly know itself when it meets. Even
Murphy, who for 20 years or so has given
the State an Independent 'party genefally
consisting of one, has petered out at Croy-
don (Burke). Macrossan, . who had he
been returned might have been another
Independent, took an honored name to the
poll, and was thrown out, though the State
could well do with his abilities. Ryan will
probably have 47 members behind him in a
House of 72, which will give him the
easiest working majority in Australia. With
him in office Victoria will be the one State
in the Commonwealth that hasn’t a Labor
Government.
Superintendent Ryan, of St. Helena, lias
just completed 50 years in the Prisons ser-
vice of Bananaland. Ryan is a big, burly,
upstanding fellow whose efficiency in the busi-
ness is only equalled by his judicious clem-
ency. Half a century in gaol has neither
soured nor hardened him, nor 70 years on
this wicked earth availed to cloud his judg-
ment.
In no place does the Queensland climate
work such havoc as in Dunwich. Of five
inmates who died recently in one week three
were over 90. Heaven knows what will hap-
pen when the Far North gets its asylum at
Ravenswood or Herberton, where the climatic
conditions are almost ideal.

Look to Your Teeth.

Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-

keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-

are too severe on the enamel.

I AM A WOMAN who belongs to a prematurely
grey haired family. My father was grey before he
was 30, and two of my brothers as well as my sister
became grey early in life. Bofore the age of 25 1
developed grey hairs, which became quite embar-
rassing to me -socially, and also in business I
LOST THREE GOOD POSITIONS for no other reason
than my fading hair. The groyness increased with
alarming rapidity, and at I LOOKED USE A
WOMAN OF 45. One day I was seriously thinking
of buying one of the many Grey Hair Restorers
that are extensively advertised, when I casually
mentioned the subject to an acquaintance -a scien-
h
ĥ
tific man, and, as I after-
wards learnt, a great
student of the Che-
mistry of the Hair.
He strongly ad-
vised me to have
nothing what-
ever to do with
these concoc-
tions. He poin-
ted out that
SUCH PREPAR-
ATIONS EVENT-
UALLY RUINED
THE HAIR, and
in the moanti me
rarely deceived
even the casual
observer. He sug-
g§s telct* that I try a
formula-that he had
perfected after a con-
siderable time, which,
by a certain chemical
action on the pigmentary colouring cells restored
the hair to its normal colour, in repl- to my en-
quiries he assured me that the formula-was-not
only absolutely harmless, but would develop A
STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL GROWTH OF HAIR. My
rrmnd wrote out his prescription, which I had made
up, and after carefu.ly .ollowing the instructions for
a tew days, L was surprised and delighted to find my
hair be coning richer and darker in tone. The re-
co.ounng process continued until after some few
weeks my hair actually once again possessed the
natural shade of my gir ish days. Since then I HAVE
3HEN INUNDATED WITH ENQUIRIES from friends
ami also persons unknown to me, who came to hear
of this wonderful preparation. Having become con-
vinced that I have found A REMEDY OF EXTRA-
ORDINARY MERIT, and which is quite harm'ess, I
have resolved to off-r it for sale, as I am certain
from my own experience that it will prove an ines-
timable boon to any man or woman who finds grey,
hair to be the same serious handicap it was to me.

“0.K.” : An English critic protests against
the foolishness of trying to bring even 10-
year-old plays— not to mention older ones—
right up to date in their trimmings. This
apropos a change in the music-hall- song
which the heroine sings in St. John Hankin’s
“The Cassilis Engagement.” The critic
argues that any play worth reviving as a
work of art should be presented in its
original form. It should remain true to the
period. On the other hand, a manager
might argue that it would be one thing to
drop “Under the Greenwood Tree” from
“As You Like It” in favor of “Down in the
Forest,” and quite another thing to change
“Stop Your Tickling” for “Who Were You
With Last Night?” in St. John Hankin’s
play. An anachronism doesn’t matter much
unless it hurts, and the difference between
“Stop Your Tickling” and the more recent
ditty is not very painful. You can hardly
feel it.
“Harrison O.”: Melbourne Repertory
audiences seem to like one-act plays, and
the Repertory players appear more at home
in them than in longer pieces. But surely
the management can furnish something bet-
ter than Pinero’s “Playgoers.” Excellent
performances of “Rosmersholm” and “John
Gabriel Borkman” have proved that
Gregan McMahon can provide casts capable
of handling strong work, so why not try
some of Strindberg’s one-acters? Audi-
ences may not yet be educated up to “Miss
Julie,” but “The Creditor,” “Paria” and
“The _ Stronger Woman” are worth a trial.
And isn’t it time we had a performance of
a play by Synge, if only a one-acter? There
are two little masterpieces to choose from
in “The Shadow of the Glen” and “Riders
to the Sea.” Four years ago this month
the Repertory Theatre was started, and it
has so far ignored both Strindberg and
Synge—two of the biggest figures in modern
dramatic literature —while finding stage
room for stuff like “Peter’s Mother” and
‘Tlaygoers.”
“Giovanni”: A turn that is going well at
English ’Alls is supplied by “Taree, the Aus-
tralian Musical Bushman.” Disguised as a
stage stockman —spurs and all—he appears
with a sixpenny mouth-organ and a zither.
As the stringed instrument requires both
hands the mouth-organ has to be partially
swallowed and manipulated by lips and
tongue. With the two weapons “Taree” kills
various operatic selections and gives imita-
tions of the bagpipes, a crying baby and a
drum-and-five band. He also gets a bugle-
call effect by blowing through a rift in his
teeth. As all bushmen wear spurs and a
zither and carry round a hole where a tooth
once stood, this looks like the genuine article.
“Private Boxer”: “Kaniva” (B. 29/4/T5)
speaks of my arguments regarding Sunday
Shakspeare, and says they lose value when
dissected. He proceeds to dissect them to
his own satisfaction, but is forced to the
same conclusion as myself—viz., that none
of the Shakspearian productions of recent
years were over-popular at the box office.
Then he goes on to say that “Matheson
Lang would have drawn full houses in ‘Ham-
let,’ but failed to produce it /” What better
proof of the popularity of Shakspeare could
anybody want?
In the gathering together of theatrical.
relics to be sold in aid of the Red Cross
funds Macready’S personal prompt book of
“Henry V.,” produced at Covent Garden
1815, came to light. It bore his signature
—no doubt about the handwriting—and he
spelt it “M’Cready.”
“J.F.11.” : Melba sent a heated and hys-
terical telegram from Melbourne to the
London papers indignantly denying the
statement that she had entered into a con-
tract to sing for 5000 dollars a week in
Yankee variety. Her London rep., in an
interview, confirmed the contradiction from
his personal knowledge. Why, he asked,
should Melba sing for a week in variety
theatres for 5000 dollars when she can
always earn that much by appearing at a
single concert?
From London :—-
J. M. Barrie has not yet got over the first effects
of his baronetcy. His two new pieces at the Duke
of York’s are incoherent, and no two critics agree as
to what he is driving at. ‘‘Rosy Rapture” was
originally billed as a revue ; then it became a bur-
lesque. Apparently it is intended for a skit on the
“eternal triangle.” The other piece, “The New
Word,” is an even worse conundrum. It is just a
rambling conversation between a father, his 19-vear-
old son in khaki and a second lieutenant. Nobody
bo far has found out what the new word is. A week
hence nobody will want to.
. “8.J.” : A potted edition of “For the Term
of His Natural Life” has been used as a
vaudeville sketch. The playlet, “The Im-
postor,” was written by Marcus Clarke’s
daughter, Marion (now with the Niblos),
and was performed by her for 20 months in
the Land of the Stars and Tripes. A son
of Clarke’s has won a decent position on the
Yankee stage as a character actor. He calls
himself Arthur Elton.

It is a curious thing, but true—
An egotism strange is bred
In all the varied miming crew
Who in the public vision do
Queer caperings to earn their bread.

Could pass by photographic dens ;
The chorus girl who stands in line,
The tumbler, clown, the columbine
Are taken captive by the lens.

Who off his iron chains has shaken- —
He wanders forth to take the air,
Beholds a camera, and there
He lingers gladly to be taken!

Vest Pocket Kodak.
When your soldier friend is at the front you will often be longing for a glimpse of him, just as he will be
longing for a peep of home. Give him a little Soldier’s Kodak—the Vest Pocket Kodak and ewi sen
you back many interesting snapshots of himself and his doings. Get one yourself, too, and send him
pictures of home to cheer him up and keep him in touch with you.
It is Light and Small
The Vest Pocket Kodak just turns the scale at 9oz. —less than
half the weight of the regulation service field glasses, and is
little bigger than a silver cigarette case.
It is Strong
being made of aluminium and steel. All exposed parts have
a smooth, black, rustproof enamel finish.
It is Simple
You can learn to use it in half an hour. No skill, no practice,
no scientific knowledge is needed. It needs no focussing and
is always ready.
Size of Picture
Compresses a wide view into a little picture 2jin. long and
Hill. wide. It is then easy to make enlargements of any size.
Finishing* of Pictures
The Vest Pocket Kodak takes eight pictures on one cartridge of
Kodak Film —and Kodak Film keeps fresh for over a year.

£20,000 for News Pictures
Already the sales of the Vest Pocket Kodak —the Soldier s Kodak
have broken a record. Now comes the offer of no less than £20,000
by three London newspapers—The “Daily Mirror’ (£5000); the
“ Daily Mail” (£5000); the “ Daily Sketch ” (£10,000). Full details
may be found in their current issues. Even a single photograph
enlarged from a Vest Pocket Kodak negative may be worth £lOOO.
Think what this means to every soldier.

SYMPTOMS Of KIONEY TROUBLE
ARE YOU IN Danger through
IGNORANCE?
Nearly all of our readers suffer from
aches and pains of some kind at one time
or another. Aches and pains very often
mean kidney troubles. Such symptoms as
constipation, backache, improper action of
the bowels, pains in muscles and joints,
nasty taste in the mouth first thing in the
morning, swelling of the feet, cloudy urine,
a general feeling of weakness and irrita-
bility, backache, all these are symptoms ot
kidney trouble. . .
They are caused by the poisonous acid in
the blood which the kidneys should remove,
but they do not owing to- their being in a
weak state. ,
To cure kidney trouble of any kind you
must positively get rid of the cause the
poisonous uric acid. Remember, to do tins
a real remedy must pass through the kid-
neys and the bladder, and not through the
bowels, as most kidney pills do. When you
see the urine change to a muddy bluish color
—a feature which distinguishes De Witts
Pills from all others—-you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing
touch on the right spot —the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is the reason why De
Witt’s give such amazingly quick relief
every time. A permanent cure follows in
almost every case.
DE WITT’S KIDNEY and BLADDER PILLS
can be obtained at any of the branches of
Washington H. Soul Pattinson & Co., Ltd.,
Sydney; Longmore’s The Melbourne 1 har-
macy, Bourke Street, Melbourne; and all
leading chemists at 2/9 and 5/6 per large
box. The 5/6 size is two and a half times
as large as the 2/9 size, and contains
enough doses to last you three weeks, iry
your nearest chemist, but if you have any
difficulty in obtaining De Witt’s Pills send
the price of the package required to either
of the firms mentioned above, and the goods
will be sent by return, post free.*

The Union Co. t 293 Elizabeth Street, Mett.
Died at Sydney on May 21, Ebenezer
Vickery, son of that Ebenezer who was in
his day the uncrowned king of Sydney
Methodism. The son now deceased followed
his father’s example, and was a leading
spirit in the movement which turned the
Lyceum Theatre into church property, to
iraw golden revenue from Spencer’s Pic-
tures. In commerce he was concerned with
many things, from coal to hides.
Solemnly cabled from London that after the
assault on the Turks at Gaba Tepe, one of
the Australians remarked (all names care-
fully unmentioned) : “We would not have
succeeded in the way we did if we had been
trained like the regulars, or in a manner
which took from us our initiative.” The
take of the cheap writer, every word of it!
Does anybody know any Billjim who, on
coming out of a fight, would talk wordy
stodge like that?
“0.K.”: Chief Justice John Madden, re-
cently back in Melbourne from Europe, has
been “chatting” about the war, and his chat
was pathetically foolish. The Germans, ac-
cording to Madden, are now making a final
effort to save themselves from an exposure
of their beaten condition. The war is to be
over in August. Meanwhile the British Gov-
ernment has gone into reconstruction, Kitch-
ener is asking for more troops, Russia is
staggering under the weight of its part of the
job, and Sweden and Norway state that Ger-
tnan warships in the Baltic prevent them
from exporting stuff to anywhere but Ger-
many. Britain is engaged in a desperate
struggle with Turkey, and the Germans in
Berlin are waving flags as usual. And Mad-
den is giving reasons why the war will be
triumphantly ended by the Allies in two
months’ time. Can’t such foolish people be
tied up before they do further damage to the
strenuous enlisting that is indispensable?
When the foolish t mob at Wanganui
(M.L.) put stones through the windows in
the business premises of the Hallensteins,
they hit something of German origin right
enough, for old Bendix Hallenstein, who
founded the concern which carries on busi-
ness in nearly every part of the Dominion,
was born within sight of the Rhine. But
the family hasn’t any tickets on the Hun.
Just about the time the Wanganui braves
were heaving road-metal about, to the loss
only of Australasian insurance cos., a young
Maorilander fell mortally wounded fighting
with his regiment against the ravishers of
Belgium. That was Lieutenant Hyams, a
grandson of old Bendix, and nephew of the
men who own most of the property the
Wanganui larrikins bombarded in the inter-
ests of “patriotism.”
Thierry ’: Foch, the French general who,
according to Joffre,' is the “greatest strategist
in Europe and the humblest,” has charge
ot the actual scrapping along the whole
Gallic line. He is a curious product of the
h rench brand of militarism, and outside
army affairs is nervous, aloof and given to
platitudes as if they were pearls. Inside
the army he is another proposition. He
knows what the French soldier can and
can’t do better than anybody- else, and prac-
tically every officer is known to him as a
personal value. While he works out his
schemes mathematically, he has a way of
making Napoleonic appeals to his troops—
and the French like that. He views war in
its dramatic aspect, delights in big charges
and tremendous surprises. Joffre is the
cool brain; Foch is the temperamental per-
son who makes splendid deeds possible. Foch
lias a somewhat German name and was born
at Metz, but his family comes from the ex-
treme opposite corner of France.


SILL PIMPLES
COVERED FACE
In [Large Blotches. Festered and
Looked Angry. Then Broke Into
Eruptions. Very Disfiguring.
Used Cuticura Soap and Oint-
ment. Pimples Disappeared.
'‘Fermanagh,” Botany Ed., Waterloo
South, Aust. —“Some time ago my face
became covered with small pimples ior
fully;a fortnight, which appeared in large
blotches mostly on the cheeks, chin and
neck. They used to fester and look very
angry and then break into sores which were
very disfiguring so I resolved to try the
Cuticura Remedies, washing with the Cuti-
cura Soap and after letting it dry, applying
the Cuticura Ointment to the affected parts
ahd after a week’s application with the
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment the
pimples had all disappeared I am thankful
to say.
“Thereis no better soap to use on children
than Cuticura Soap. All mothers should
use it. They would soon find it stops that
itching rash and small sores so frequent, in
children’s heads going to school. I have
found the Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment good for cuts, boils, sore hands
and have also found it splendid for tired
feet, which I anoint with the Cuticura
Ointment. I always keep both the Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment in the house
in case of an emergency.” (Signed) Mrs.
M. Nelson, May 2S, 1914.

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
There are sermons in stones —
also in teeth. We’ll choose the
latter for our text.
But if everyone used Pebeco
Tooth Paste there would be no
further need of sermons, preach-
ments or parables on the proper
care of the teeth.
Pebeco Tooth Paste solves the
problem by ridding the mouth of
the enamel-destroying acids. “Acid
Mouth” is the dreaded thief which
experts now agree is the cause of
95% of all tooth decay. Pebeco
Tooth Paste arrests this acidity of
the mouth —even destroys the
acid-producing bacteria them-
selves.
You have not settled the
problem of your teeth by merely
keeping them white, clean and
polished. Pebeco Tooth Paste
will SAVE them.

AN/EMIA
(Poorness of Blood)
Pallor Depression Exhaustion
Be sure you take Iron ‘Jelloids’ when Anaemic.
In Anaemia the whole body suffers, because the rich red blood
upon which the well-being of the whole body depends is lacking.
The system then becomes weakened and debilitated, the nerves
are starved, the heart is overworked. The result is Lack of Energy,
Depression, Paleness of Lips and Cheeks, Breathlessness and
Exhaustion after slight Exertion. To remove these symptoms the
blood must be enriched and the simplest, most
pleasant and economical way to do this is to take Iron Jelloids.
Iron Jelloids'
enrich the blood—renew vitality
Theßevd. A. J. Waidron, Vicar of Brixton, says : “I have heard
“ about your Iron ‘Jelloids ' froma Doctor, and have recently had occasion
“to take them. lam strongly of the opinion that if the public realised the
“fact that they have at hand at such a small cost such a pleasant and efficient
“remedy for'Anaemia, and such a splendid tonic for Nerve-strain, etc. ,
“many a home would be happier and many a life made brighter.”
A fortnight’s trial ( Price 1/6 ) will convince you.
For Women, No. 2. Special Tonic for Men, No. 2A. (containing Quinine),
For Children, No. 1. Sold in England at 1/1* and 2/9, per box.

The Inky Way.
Malcolm Boss, Maoriland’s official wai
recorder, had, not long before the outbreak
in Europe, travelled extensively in Ger-
many, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Holland,
Switzerland, Erance and Italy, and crossed
the Carpathians twice (it would be some-
thing extra-special in mountains that would
hold up Ross), lie was also through Servia
and Roumania. When Maoriland sent swad-
dles to snatch Samoa, Ross went with them,
and his experience of the island gained as
a correspondent there during „the war of
1899 was of considerable the com-
mandant. For his services in this connec-
tion he was mentioned in despatches. He
has been about 20 years in louland’s Parlia-
mentary Press Gallery.

“E.S.S.”: One result of the European
disturbance will be that we shall have some-
thing to write about for years and years.
It is a long time since the last shot was
fired in the U.S. Civil War, yet the shindy
is still 'the theme of American novelists.
Writers in Australia, especially poets,
envied other countries their wars; many of
them seemed to think that the peaceful con-
quest of Australia was a great mistake.
In desperation they seized on the little
scuffle at Eureka, and have worked it from
all conceivable points for half a century. A
book on the eruption was published only a
few months ago. Australia will now d*P
into real war literature. Her stories will be
tinged with it for generations to come.
There will first be a tremendous crop of
books dealing directly with the great
calamity. Australia will not be content
with other nations’ output, but must have
the military and naval histories of her own
part in the conflict. There will be the
“official history,” and half a dozen war
correspondents’ “histories.” Then the trail
of blood, the roving cruiser, _ the hunted
tourist and the outraged civilian will run
through thousands of novels. _No doubt in
the course of ages the theme will wear out;
but it will make twentieth centurv litera-
ture the reddest ever known.

Some remarkable snapshots were taken
by an amateur on board the Falaba when
she was torpedoed in English waters. In
between helping to lower boats and save the
women, he snapped industriously, and only
when the sinking vessel’s funnel was lying over
nearly on a level with the water he reckoned
it was time to Quit. Putting his camera
into his pocket, lie- hopped overboard and
was hauled aboard another vessel about an
hour later. Although the machine was de-
stroyed. the films were dry and uninjured.
One alone he sold to a London newspaper
for £2OO.

Received, a copy of the paper that claims
to have been the first in the world to an-
nounce the demise of the Ernden. Thk
Kangaroo is its good Australian name, and
it was published on the troopship Afrie,
which carried some of the First Expedition-
ary Force. The news of the pirate’s
end was received by wireless, and Tiie
Kangaroo set it forth with black headlines
in the. best evening-paper style.

“Sacramentio” : It was in a Hobart daily,
and the story was about a triple wedding, at
which, after the bonds had been firmlv tied,
his Reverence addressed the victims on the
Sacrament of Marriage. But the comp, knew
better, and the community learned next day
that “after the ceremony the happy couples
were addressed on the Sacrament of Mater-
nity.” There really should be a censor.

London has a new afternoon paper—the
Echo and Evening Chronicle, issued from
the office of the Daily Chronicle. Its only
excuse is that the D.C. people wanted a baby
to play with. The Daily Mail has the
Evening News ; the Standard has an even-
ing issue of the same name as itself: the
Daily News brings out the evening Star;
and the Daily Telegraph prints every after-
noon six copies of the Evening Telegraph.
and thereby legally retains its copyright, and
reserves the privilege Of bringing out a
evening paper whenever it sees fit. There is
nothing very novel about the Echo and
Evening Chronicle, except that for a week
or two it will accept no advertisements
whatever. The Echo, by the way, was
London’s first halfpenny evening paper,
founded by John Cassell, head of the great
publishing house, in the ’sixties.
THE POET SANG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The poot sui n' with his soul on fire.
Without a thought of reward or hire.
For when to think of his pay he stopped,
He noticed his inspiration dropped.
So he made his song in the forge of his heart
And the finished thing was a work of art.
Then he took it in—as a poet must—
To market the thing .in some paper’s dust.
And they measured it with impassive face,
For Art was a thing they bought by space.
They judged his treasure —the fact is hard- -
Not carat by carat, but yard by yard.
Then they did a sum on the poem’s rump
Which gave its creator the blessed hump.
For, bought by the fathom, as all might see,
The poem’s value Was one-and-three!
The poet shuffled his gifted feet,
And signed with a flourish the sad receipt,
Ere he walked away with his thoughts at sea
And a speck in his palm—the one-and-three I
He tearfully d —d his mistress Art,
And wished he could drive a horse and cart,
Or trundle a barrow or shovel coal,
For such plain jobs required no soul.
He knew of all gifts that “soul” was worst;
For owners of souls must sing or burst.
With a heart as heavy as any log,
He sat and howled like a mourning dog.
In ragged garments, with chin in air,
He sat and howled in his mad despair.
And no one who heard him e’er guessed that he
Bewailed a lost poem, price one-and-three.

Mrs. J. M. Gregg’s Twins, who were
cured of Bronchitis by
Dr. Sheldon s New Discovery
“My twins, a boy ami a girl, were very bad with severe colds and bronchitis for
months,” writes Mrs. J. M. Gregg, 12 Bradshaw Street, Caversham, South Dunedin,
N.Z. “Their coughing was terrible to hear, and caused them to go black in the face,
and, after one of these bouts they would be quite exhausted for some time. Their
little chests and throats w'ere very sore. They were under medical treatment, hut
with no beneficial results, and we tried every known remedy without any real benefits.
I was worried very much over them, but one day I took up a paper and saw Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery advertised, and am very pleased, for it has proved a great
blessing. I procured a bottle, and after using very little I saw a great change in
them, and by the time the second bottle was finished they were in good health and
completely cured, thanks to that wonderful medicine, Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
I would strongly recommend all mothers and those having the care of children to
always keep a bottle in the house, as I intend to do myself, and I wish Dr. Sheldon's
New Discovery every success.”
What Do You Give Baby for His Cold ?
Foolish mothers dose their babies with home-made concoctions, and perhaps upset the little
stomach and make the baby cross and uncomfortable by this mistaken economy. Wise
mothers do not experiment with untried nostrums, but depend on a remedy which has been
compiled from the scientific prescription of a famous physician, and is designed to cure the
cold without upsetting the digestive organs. Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is this Remedy, and
mothers may give it to their babies, secure in the knowledge that coughs and colds will no
longer rack the little bodies. For croup, it has the most wonderful results. Whooping Cough
is cut short by the use of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery. For all the family ills resulting from
throat, chest or lung complaint the mother’s resource is Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is the quickest, safest and best-known
Remedy for Coughs, Colds, Pleurisy, Bronchitis and all Throat and Chest
Troubles, and can always be relied upon. Obtainable at all Chemists and
Storekeepers at 1/6 and 3/- a bottle.

A FEW HOMELY
. . HINTS ON . .
BEAUTY
By RITA MOYA.
Every woman should take pride in her personal appearance. If it is not possible to
be beautiful in the fullest sense of the word, at least you can have the attractiveness of a
pleasant expression, glossy, well-kept hair, eyes shaded by long lashes, well marked eye-
brows and a clear, natural complexion. My first advice is to avoid most manufactured
“beauty preparations.” Use simple, pure, natural ingredients. . Use these regularly, an o
not make constant changes and experiments. The various things I use and advise can e
bought in original packages from any reliable chemist. If they are not in stock he can
once procure them from bis wholesaler if you insist.
How I Discarded an Unsightly Complexion.
—How many women exclaim as they behold
their ugly complexions in the mirror: “If I
could only tear off this old skin!” and, do you
know, it is now possible to do that very thing?
Not to actually remove the entire skin all of a
sudden; that would be too heroic a method
and painful, too, I imagine. The worn-out
cuticle comes off in such tiny particles, and
so gradually—requiring about 10 days to com-
plete the transformation —it doesn’t hurt a bit,
Day by day the beautiful complexion under-
neath comes forth. Marvellous! No matter
how muddy, rough, blotchy or aged your com-
plexion, you can surely discard it by this
simple process. Just get some ordinary mer-
colised wax at your chemist’s, apply nightly
like cold -cream, washing it off in the morn-
ings.
New Painless Way to Remove Hairy
Growths.—lt now transpires that the mys-
terious white paste used so successfully by
many beauty specialists for ridding" the skin
of objectionable hairy growths is! nothing
more than powdered pheminol, which can be
found in any chemist’s shop. With pheminol
and water make enough paste to cover hairy
surface; apply, and in two of three minhtes
rub off. wash the skin, and it will be free
'from hair or blemish.
j. £ ■ ref r-'cj j-ifs,. i';
‘ Shampoo and Hair Beautifler^You complain
.otsbcittte. faded hair; You will-And that keep-
ing the scalp clean and healthy is the most
effective way to restore the natural! beauty
and softness, but in selecting your shampoo
avoid soaps or'"mixtures containing “free”
alkali. By dissolving a teaspoonful of stallax
in a cup of hot water you will have a mild,
soothing, cleansing mixture that makes the
head feel fine and removes all dust, dandruff
and excess of oil, leaving the scalp clean and
pliant, and assuring a beautiful growth of
long, lustrous, fluffy hair.
No Powder Necessary. —Yes, powder _ has
ruined more complexions that it has aided,
and while you use it you can hope for nothing
better than an imitation of a real complexion.
Take my advice. Get from your chemist some
ordinary cleminite and dissolve in a little
w r ater, then you will have an ideal yet inex-
pensive lotion, which seems a part of the skin,
The result lasts all day long even under the
most trying conditions. To prepare the face
and neck for an evening in a. hot ballroom
there is nothing to'equal this simple and harm -
less lotion. -
If Eyelashes are Short. —Eyelashes will be
greatly beautified if mennaline be applied at
lash-roots with thumb and forefinger. A
few such treatments make them grow' long,
■silky and curly. Thin, straggly eyebrows will
grow thick and lustrous by merely rubbing
■mennaline on, but be careful and don’t get
any where no hair is w'anted.
Wonderful Growth of Hair. —Long ago I
made a resolution to try and concoct, a real
hair grow'er. My! own formula, now perfected
after tedious experimenting, has had the effect
of giving nie a wealth of hair that is surpris-
ing. Obtain from your chemist an original
package of boranium and mix with this i-pint
of bay rum. R.ub this into the scalp night
ancTYhorning~wTth the finger tips. It sets the
hair roots tingling with new life. [6

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LI WEET, sv-ect, sweet and clear,
Over the hills and hollow's rang,
Thrilling the soul and charming the ear,
The song of a bird at Burrawang.
“Hush!” I said, at the crest of the hill—
“ Hush and hearken aw'hile with me.
Strange.. .. that moment the song grew still,
Muted the torrent of melody.
High, high, dark and high,
Stilling the feather’d throat that sang,
Over the hollows and up in the sky,
A liaw-k hung w'atching o’er Burrawang.
Clear, clear, clear and sw-eet,
Over a valley far away,
Dew on her forehead and dew at her feet,
A girl’s voice rose at the break of day.
"Hush and listen,” the ploughman said —-
“Pause and hearken awhile with me!”
Strange... .that moment the song fell dead.
Muted the torrent of melody.
High, high, dark and high,
Wheeling, wdieeling from realms afar.
Marring the calm of the azure sky
There hung the eagle whose name is War.

RODERIC QUINN.
The Tender of the Three
Cheers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE schooner Maiwara, storeship to
Brodzin and Sadler’s pearling fleet,
floated up before a fine topsail breeze
to the ocean-pool of quiet where the lug-
gers lay at anchor, waiting the Sunday
delivery of stores and clearance of shell. It
was a day of great beauty. The graciously-
warm air of June —Torres Strait’s best
attempt at winter—had an equable motion ;
the gorgeous sunbirds chattered as they flew
between the schooner’s shining masts, un-
painted, but glossy with oil, and tapering to
the brown trucks; flying fish, of shorter
flights than in the long swells of the Indian
Ocean, steeplechased from their enemies at
the rushing fore-foot; the blue of sky and
sea splashed rudely with the brown and
copper and green of the islands.
In the mainhold a Japanese carpenter
cased the prepared shell, and stencilled its
address to Hatton Garden: in the after-hold
a great bank of iron chains, and anchors,
and gear waited for the demands of the
fleet; the food for the week to come stacked
on deck, amidships. Representatives of half
a dozen races of the earth lounged about —
crew and reliefs for the fleet; a Norwegian,
an Italian, a Russian, three Australians, with
Japanese, Filipinos. Malays. Javanese,
Rotumalis, Iviwais and Binghis of North
Australia.
In the cabin the general manager. Sander-
son, and Marriott, another Australian, the
accountant of the Torres Pearling Co., signed
on a thin, dark, grey-bearded man as tender
of the Three Cheers —a lugger of the fleet.
He had given his name as John Calvin; his
place of birth as Hamilton, on Great Ber-
muda ; his nationality as British. They
signed him on as tender, and he left the
cabin for the deck.
“I suppose that’s all right, putting him
down as British,” said Marriott, dubiously.
“But he’s nig., or three-quarter nig., all the
same.”
“There’s plenty of full-blood nig. British
subjects, and Bermuda is a British posses-
sion. But he’s darker than a Mestizo, isn’t
he ?”
“Sun’s had a lot to do with it. But
there’s black blood there—cross of Spaniard
and Indian at the beginning. Yet he writes
well, and talks like a professor.”
“He’s been a telegraph-operator, he tells
me—-first in Bermuda, and then at Ban joe-
wangie.”
“What’s he want to come down to be ten-
der of a lugger for?”
“I don’t know—didn’t ask....lost his
punch, I suppose.... It doesn’t matter to
u 5.... The fleet’s full of broken men....
booze or women.”
“Or a woman.”
“That’s worse. Or fooling with the other
fellow’s cash-b0x.... But this fellow Calvin
knows his job ; he’s been tender on luggers at
Broome —his references are all right... .Let’s
go and look-for-see.”
They went on deck, and found the nearest
of the fleet anchored out a mile to the east-
ward. In half an hour John Calvin, of
Great Bermuda, ex-telegraph operator, was
installed as tender of the Three Cheers, 14-
ton lugger of the Torres Pearling Company’s
fleet; vice William Darnley, resigned. The
Maiwara delivered stores, and a new life-
line, and a new one-inch Manila rope; took
delivery of the week!s shell; left the new-
tender with his Jap. diver, Suzuki; a Binghi
and a Iviwai boy as crew and power for the
air-pump; then departed on her round of the
fleet.
, Late in the afternoon they saw her pass
on her return to Thursday Island, her deck
hidden in piles of shell, golden-lip, and silver-
lip ; and deeper in the water than she w T as in
the morning. With the night-fall the Three
Cheers—w-hich had astonished all hands by
her gentle motion all the day—began to feel
the ground-swell, and rolled continuously.
* * * *
Calvin was awake at daylight—had
scarcely slept all night. He lay on his
back, locking up to the ceiling of the little
cabin, three feet above his bunk, and sighed.
The deadly monotony of months in a rolling
lugger was ahead of him; but his sigh w'as
for something nearer—some acute sorrow
l hat time and usage could not dull. The
lugger rolled ceaselessly in that mere sus-
picion of a sea. he knew that her copper
would gleam the sun ai! day, as all night it
had gleamed the stars. A plate rolled out of
the crockery-rack and broke on the cabin-
floor; he longed for the firmness of the
earth, while knowing that for him it
had no security. lie heard the endless rattle
of wind-bloAvn blocks in the sheaves, and the
rustling of halyards against the masts. The
sound reminded him of a day at Koepang in
his own sail-boat, a fresh breeze, the bow-
scarf curling white along her run, and a man
aboard he had believed to be his friend.
He shook his head impatiently, as if the
action would shake his memories, too; then
he dropped out of his bunk, and dressed as
if there were only a few minutes to escape
drowning.
The diver hurried his breakfast, anxious to
escape from the everlasting rolling to the
solid floor of the sea. He donned the dress ;
Calvin screwed the helmet on, saw that air-
pipe and life-line were free, led him to the
ladder, hung the leaden weights at his back
and chest, gave the signal to the men at the
pump, and screwed the face-glass home; and
Suzuki descended the ladder, and sank into
the green water, a monstrous, air-bloated
thing.
They raised anchor, and let the lugger
drift in the track of the shell; reaped a
swathe; raised the diver, and beat back
again: and so to more diving, and drifting,
and winning of shell. And for ever and ever
the lugger rolled her long arc; through the
slow-drifting over the shell, and the beating
back; to the panting of the pumps and the
complaints of a worn bearing; to blue
sky and blue sea, and steel-blue haze, and
the sun like red-hot fingers on the neck.
Then, one day, a fortnight after Calvin
joined as tender, Suzuki created a diversion.
He sank that morning, a globular seed in the
vasty field of blue, and found a, rift in the
sea-floor below his usual depth —a rift that
was a trap for the strongest spat, and, there-
fore, bore the heaviest shell. He was paid
on the lay of shell; he was tempted to dive
to 25 fathoms, and when they drew him up
—very slowly, under Calvin's practised
direction—he was paralysed.
The Maiwara took him to Thursday
Island hospital, and promised to send an-
other diver next day. Three days passed,
and Calvin was about to sail to Torres
Strait, when the schooner returned with the
new diver—-a dark, red-haired, fleshly man of
45 or so, beardless by the demand of his
occupation, short-haired as a convict, and
unshaven for a few days, so that the few
hairs upon his face showed white.
He scarcely looked at Calvin as they were
introduced, he was too occupied in stowing
his dunnage and in sourly regarding the
cabin-appointments of the Three Cheers. But
Calvin’s dark, thin face was transfigured. He
looked down the companion at the bigger
man, and went forward, his very soul crying
“Thank God!”
There was once a fool who made generali-
sations and proverbs; and, among his other
foolishnesses was the generalisation, “You
cannot tell a book by the cover.” And you
can, if you are a good reader; for the face
of a man is not more his cover than it
is the register of his thoughts and appetites.
It is translatable by instinct—that know-
ledge of evil inherited from our forebears
from their memories of ill and the desire to
escape its repetition refined in us to instinct
by transmutation in the alembic of a womb.
Then comes the man’s book-education —
“logic” and “reason” and other such man-
traps to argue the man out of bis -physical-
knowledge of evil entering his life; truly as
indisputable as that forethought which makes
some lower forms of life feel peril when it is
an inch from the antennae; which the
fly see the giant approaching at the tre-
mendous distance of a foot; the protective
aura which feels the atmosphere of the
danger zone. Calvin had instinctively dis-
liked the new diver, who now called himself
Dobson, whereas he had first known him in
the cable service as Edgar Haynes—many a
year ago.
The loud, boisterous insincerity of Haynes
had at first seemed the kindly good-humor of
a bluff and honest man; the fleshly hypocrite
tied the simplicity of the younger man to
himself until instinct was out of action abso-
lutely. And then came the awakening.
The madly-unsuccessfjil assault of his
devil by the youth Calvin (also under his
own name in those days) ; a year of gaol in
a Javan prison; then the pearling fields of
Broome, and the hell of the luggers that
rolled everlastingly. Haynes had also been
in the cable service, but his superiors made
him retire; and luck had led injurer and in-
jured to the same downward rung of the
ladder.
He could hear the new diver in the little
cabin monopolising the little world of the
Three Cheers —with all the insolence of the
naturally brutal and compulsorily ignorant.
When, failing to find satisfaction of some
want or other at the hands of the Binghi
and the Kiwai who were the crew, he came
to the deck and asked Calvin many ques-
tions, loudly and bumptiously, this brutal
egotist was so wrapped in himself that he
did not look at the man he addressed. Cal-
vin was glad; he schooled his voice to firm-
ness, and smiled at the starlit half-darkness
as he became certain that Dobson did not
know him and would never identify him with
the trembling young fellow who had taken
his sentence without a word, and had
departed silently to his prison.
The tender sat on deck looking into the
half-darkness till long after midnight; then,
wrapping himself in a rug, he wedged him-
self between the air-pump and the mast,
discribing its invisible arc against the sky.
Towards morning he had his plans prepared,
and slept like a tired child.
The new diver was about shortly after
daylight, cursing the rattling of the blocks,
-the thrashing of the halyards, the rolling of
the lugger, which had given him a night of
discomfort and alarms/ It had been more
than that: the thoughts -of the tender
charged heavily with hatred had gone aft To
the cabin of the Three Cheers; and Dobson
had felt it sub-eonsciously, as men feel that-
eyes they cannot see are regarding them.
He came to the deck by eight o’clock
dressed in his canvas-suit, and the Binghi
helped him into the heavy brass-bound,
leaden-shod boots, and fastened them updn
his feet. j/,.
The tender fixed*.his helmet and body-
weights, gave the signal for pumping as the
new diver stood upon the screwed the
face-glass on, and tapped the helmet as the
signal to dive. A flash of recognition came

DROPSY
Watery Swellings under the Eyes and in the Ankles, Limbs and Body
The fluid you take with your food,
in a single month , weighs as much as
your entire body. *
Most of this fluid has to pass out
through the kidneys, bladder and
urinary system.
Imagine what would happen if the
outlets for this water were stopped up !
In a few hours the limbs and body
would swell to a great size with the
colledled. water.
That is what actually takes place in
dropsy.
Dropsy is the name given to the
soft, watery swellings which appear in
the ankles, limbs and body, under the
eyes or in the eyelids, or on the backs
of the hands. If you press your finger
into the swollen flesh the pitting slowly
fills up with the water again.
*(i.e. —If you are of average weight.)
DROPSICAL EYES.
DROPSY is n °t a disease in itself,
but it is serious because it indicates
serious disease.
It may sliow that the kidneys are
failing to separate the waste water from
the blood, or that there is something
obstructing the urinary canals and
preventing the waste water passing out ;
or it may be caused by defective action
of the heart.
Tapping takes away the water from
under the skin, but more water soon
collects, because tapping cannot reach
the cause of the dropsy, and as long
as the cause remains the dropsy will
continue.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have
a quick and direct action on the kidneys
and bladder . They promote a free flow
from the system, washing out clogging
impurities from the passages, and
draining out the collected water through
the natural channels. They gently
lead the kidneys back to health , and
activity, and thus reach the cause of
most cases of dropsy.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have
no action on the heart, nor on the liver,
stomach or bowels ; they are solely for
the kidneys and urinary system, and
are, therefore, of the highest value in
dropsy, gravel, stone and all diseases
arising from kidney and bladder trouble.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all
chemists and storekeepers at 2/9 per bottle, or
post free by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street,

into the diver’s eyes as they looked at one
another through the face-glass; but the ten-
uer s face was impassive, and lialf-recogni-
tion was succeeded by incredulity and com-
plete denial as Dobson descended the ladder,
sprawled for a moment with his helmet in the
sunlight, and then sank in eight-fathom
water.
It was a day of interrupted work. Dob-
son ascended ere the lugger had drifted half
its swathe. lie had complaints of the dress
and the depth ; of the current and the feel
of the water, and he cursed the Iviwai and
the Binghi, who, he said, were not giving him
enough air. In argument that night he ad-
vanced a blow at the Iviwai boy; and the
Iviwai, calmly avoiding it, looked him in the
eyes without flinching. The lugger rolled
maddeningly; the day had been poor for
shell, against the figures of other days with
more competent divers; they were all irrita-
ble and sore-headed; and the short night
seemed a year long.
The diver had awakened to ill-temper,
Apparently for the pleasure of opposition, he
ordered Calvin to stay at anchor, as he was
sure of a patch of shell immediately below;
which patch he had discovered too late for
the fishery of the day before. He had donned
the dress before he spoke to them again, and
then it was to order the Iviwai boy to help
him with the great brass-toed hots. He spoke
as to a dog caught in the act of thieving;
and the Papuan was silent, chewing over his
shame.
It may have been that he was more ener-
gotic than usual in the fastening of the
boots; but the diver’s temper grew black
within him.
“You black swine,” he said. “Don’t pull
at my foot, and show off your dirty sulkiness,
you dirty nigger....”
The Iviwai was yet silent, but he tugged
harder at the second boot, and Dobson found
the new insult for him.
“You no sand-beacli boy—you dirty bush-
boy, I think.”
The Iviwai looked up at the injustice. His
eyes were quietly defiant—he desired not re-
venge, but only that the white man should
not go too far for withdrawal. The Binghi
stood by the air-pump bristling with curi-
osity of the outcome; the tender of the Three
Cheers stood by the ladder, pulling at his
pointed, grey beard, and smiling at the
enemy preparing his own destruction.
“Don’t look at me, you dam’ cannibal—you
make ’em tuck-out alonga man.”
At that the Kiwai, maddened by the insult,
wrenched the left foot as being a member of
the enemy already to his hand. The diver
cursed in the momentary pain, drew back the
right foot in its brassy boot, and kicked the
Kiwai fairly in the throat, spreading him
flat upon the deck. Dobson stood up and
kicked him in the jaw as he lay. The eyes
of the Binghi glittered murderously for a
moment. Calvin lifted the Iviwai, and
propped him against the pump. The Iviwai’s
jaw hung loosely.
“You’ve broken his jaw,” said Calvin.
“Good enough for him—didn’t you sec him
wrench my foot? Give me the helmet. I’m
on a bad clay, and I lost enough time yester-
clay.”
“We’re short a pump-hand, now.”
“You can give the Binghi a hand, then.
It’s only six fathom.”
Calvin silently screwed the helmet, led
Dobson to the ladder and hung on the
weights. The Binghi turned the handle of
the air-pump; Calvin screwed on the face-
glass, and the diver sank. He had new
thoughts that had naught to do with diving.
The man behind the pointed, grey beard
seemed familiar, and there had been some
meaning in the tapping on the face-glass. It
was not the careless rat-tat-tat on the hel-
met, to tell the diver to descend —there had
been method in it. Yet it seemed ridiculous
—lie (Trove the subject from his mind; lie
wanted money quickly, and his thought was
shell—heavy shell, with the pearls of pain
within their tortured bodies; great shell that
had seen a long struggle with the augers of
sea worms, and now lay concealed below the
madrepore and sponge, the cup-coral and the
seaweed, that grew on their right valves to
hide them from the blundering diver in the
tideway.
As the diver sank, the Binghi, looking at
the fainting, pain-racked Kiwai, said as he
turned at the pump :
“Big feller hurt that time.”
“Yes, you boy, you takern dinghy. Good
feller wind go that way—you go quick-feller
longa Carpentaria lugger, bring two feller
boy.”
He pointed to the Carpentaria, beating up
for her diver a mile away.
“You catchem pump?”
“Yes, I can pump with the lifeline around
my wrist. You go—this boy pretty bad.”
The Binghi, holding the loose end of the
painter, dropped over the stern into the
dinghy, hoisted his little sail, and ran down
the wind with a two-knot current against
him.
As soon as the stern of the Three Cheers
hid her deck from the man in the boat, Cal-
vin let go the handle of the pump flywheel.
He drew the lifeline taut, so that it vibrated
tensely at a touch of the fingers. It was a
peculiar violin string, and he played upon it
a peculiar music: dot, dot, and dash; dot,
dash ; dash, dot, dot, dot; dot, dot, dot —the
ABC of telegraphy.
Filling his wire-basket on the sea-floor the
diver felt the tightening of the lifeline, and
clasped it in his right hand. The hand began
to tremble as the aimless signals, that yet
had method in them, came to him. He could
not understand until the signals called an
old habit. Struggling with incredulity he
spelled out the message, reading by touch
“Dot! dot!”
“I.”
“Dot-dash-dot-dot.”
“L.”
“Dash-dash-dasli.”
“O.”
“Dash !”
“T ”
And then conscience filled the word for
him without the signal—llota! the Batavian
girl he had taken from the Bermudan.
He had suspected the tender with the
pointed, grey beard, and, like a fool, had
shelved his doubts. That was the meaning
of the peculiar tapping on the helmet that
morning. The tender was his enemy; his
friend when they were in the cable service
at Banjoewangie. The apple rose in his
throat; he was sorry he had ever seen Ilota.
Even now his egotism was too strong to
prompt him to blame himself. He mechani-
cally wanted more air; yet he was too
stunned by the discovery and by fear to rise
to surface and end matters iii the sunlight.
He began to feel his terrible impotence, shut
off from the world in his prison of lead,
brass, canvas and copper. He felt the dress
collapsing against him from sea-pressure act-
ing on the stripping of his armor of air;
his boots seemed each to weigh a ton ; the
back and chest-plates of lead sank against
him, and held his heart and breath.
And then he suddenly missed something—
the once-irritating thud of the air forced
into the helmet; the sound of the pump
itself, throb and refluence; the air-pipe
breathing successive “lubb!” and "dup!”
His lungs seemed to crackle in dryness;
frantically he gave the signal for air. To his
surprise it came. He had frightened that
Bermudan, then. He determined to thrash
him at the first opportunity.
The air throbbed again into the helmet;
the diver moved towards the sea-floor, imme-
diately beneath the ladder. He could see it,
moving with the rolling of the Three Cheers,
40ft. above him. The strong sunlight sank
to him, its whiteness changing to a shaft of
thin honey in the sea-green. He could see
the gleam of the lugger’s copper as she
rolled.
The lifeline was fast somewhere—lie gave
the signal to be raised. It was unnoticed ;
but the air still came to him, thudding
sweetly to his nostrils; and the silver bullets
of the exhaust bubbled from his helmet, and
found the sun again. Then he decided to
haul himself up by the lifeline, which seemed
to be made fast, and would raise him—if
only the air did not stop again.
But stop it did al the first strain on
the line. The lifeline came slack to him, and
he settled on the sea-floor again, and closed
the valve, fear gripping him at the heart,
while the dress closed slowly in upon his
body.
The lifeline was pulled taut. He held it
tensely, dully knowing that the Bermudan
would telegraph again.
“Dot-dash-dot-dot.”
“L.”
“Dot-dot.”
“I.”
“Dash-dash.”
“M.”
“Dot-dash.”
“A.”
“Dot-dot-dot-dot.”
“H.”
“ ‘Li-ma-Hong!’ My God! He knows I
left Ilota with the Chows at Singapore. I’ll
climb! Bet me die in the sun—-not like
this !”
The lifeline came away slack. The pump
throbbed again; the air came to save him
from suffocation. Already his lips were
purpling, and his neck-veins puffed under
the stress ; but the air flowrnd down, and he
was almost normal when it stopped again.
“Dot-dash-dash-dot.”
-IV’
“Dot-dash.”
“A.”
“Dot-dot-dot.”
“‘S’ I knew it! Pastroro the Bermu-
dan. I’ll never get away alive. I'm in a
copper gaol, and he has all the air in the
world, and won’t, give me a breath of it.’
Choking with despair, he seized the lifeline
arid hauled himself liaud-over-hand; and.
this time, the. line held. The heat and agony
of suffocation seemed to swell the veins of
his neck to bursting; but, when he was a
dozen feet below the rolling keel, the tender
who studied the bubbles saw that they were
weakening, and gave the handle of the pump
a few turns, slightly relieving the suffocating
man.
* * *
The diver’s hand, rising on the line, showed
first. Then the great helmet came awash, as
the diver, blind with suffocation, found the
ladder with his feet. Calvin, grimly smiling,
pumped air again to give his enemy strength
to ascend almost to a level with the rail.
Then he stopped pumping, and. stooping,
looked through the at the purple-
lipped. leaden-eyed man within. Revenge
looked at Crime ; hatred glared at fear and
saw, through the bully’s eyes, that the very
soul of him was afraid.
Dobson lifted a trembling hand to close
the valve, even to rc-breathe his own viti-
ated air; and the tender gently palled the
hand down again, and held it; and the air
whistled from the helmet. The diver, stand-
ing on the ladder, knee-deep in the sea, knew
that all sense was leaving him. The back
and chest-weights seemed to enter his flesh.
Calvin glared again into the dull eyes, and'
pushed him off the ladder, holding the lifeline
to check his descent. Then, with only the
helmet partly .above water, he spun the diver
as if he were a weight on a string, so that
the air-pipe twisted on itself, ten feet above
the helmet. And then lie let go the lifeline,
and the diver plunged like a stone.
The last bubble came to the surface. The
fender waited for live minutes, looked astern,
and saw the dinghy returning, and half a
mile away. He turned at the pump until the
resistance told him that the twist in the air-
pipe held ; tivn lie rested until he saw the
boat near; and, looking oyer the rail, arid
seeing no bubbles, he. for form’s sake, re-
sumed his pumping. And suddenly he knew
that the Kiwai had recovered consciousness,
and was watching him.
“Boat come now.”
“More better.” mumbled the broken-jawed
one. “Where diver he stop?”
“Down there.”
“I kill him one time.”
And the Bermudan knew that lie was safe
Sanderson and Marriott agree that Dobson
was an impostor, and no diver. Else how
could a man acquainted with gear get two
lock-twists in a straight dive?
“Anyhow,” said Sanderson, “it’s his
funeral. He paid for it.”
So lie had ; though they had no knowledge
of his creditor, or of his debt.
